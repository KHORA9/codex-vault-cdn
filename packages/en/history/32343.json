Paris became to a certain\r\nextent, and not altogether voluntarily, cosmopolitan before the palatial\r\nmansions, the broad avenues, the handsome public squares which\r\nsubsequently excited the admiration of the civilized world had been\r\ndreamt of, and while its outer aspect was as yet scarcely modified. This\r\nwas mainly due to the establishment of railways, which caused in the end\r\nlarge influxes of foreigners and provincials, who as it were drove the\r\nreal Parisian from his haunts. Those visitors rarely penetrated in large\r\nnumbers to the very heart of the Quartier-Latin. When they crossed the\r\nbridges that span the Seine, it was to see the Sorbonne, the Panthéon,\r\nthe Observatory, the Odéon, and the Luxembourg; they rarely stayed after\r\nnightfall. The Prado, the Théâtre Bobino, the students' taverns, escaped\r\ntheir observation when there was really something to see; and now, when\r\nthe Closerie des Lilas has become the Bal Bullier, when the small\r\ntheatre has been demolished, and when the taverns are in no way\r\ndistinguished from other Parisian taverns--when, in short, commonplace\r\npervades the whole--people flock thither very often. But during the\r\nwhole of the forties, and even later, the _rive gauche_, with its\r\nQuartier-Latin and adjacent Faubourg St. Germain, were almost entirely\r\nsacred from the desecrating stare of the deliberate sightseer; and,\r\nconsequently, the former especially, preserved its individuality, not\r\nonly materially, but mentally and morally--immorally would perhaps have\r\nbeen the word that would have risen to the lips of the observer who\r\nlacked the time and inclination to study the life led there deeper than\r\nit appeared merely on the surface. For though there was a good deal of\r\nroystering and practical joking, and short-lasted _liaison_, there was\r\nlittle of deliberate vice, of strategic libertinism--if I may be allowed\r\nto coin the expression. True, every Jack had his Jill, but, as a rule,\r\nit was Jill who had set the ball rolling.\r\n\r\nThe Quartier-Latin not only sheltered sucking lawyers and doctors,\r\nbudding professors and savans and littérateurs, but artists whose names\r\nhave since then become world-renowned. It was with some of these that I\r\nwas most thrown in contact in that quarter, partly from inclination,\r\nbecause from my earliest youth I have been fonder of pictures than of\r\nbooks, partly because at that time I had already seen so many authors of\r\nfame, most of whom were the intimate acquaintances of a connection of\r\nmine, that I cared little to seek the society of those who had not\r\narrived at that stage. I was very young, and, though not devoid of faith\r\nin possibilities, too mentally indolent when judgment in that respect\r\ninvolved the sitting down to manuscripts. It was so much easier and\r\ncharming to be able to discover a budding genius by a mere glance at a\r\ngood sketch, even when the latter was drawn in charcoal on a not\r\nparticularly clean \"whitewashed\" wall.\r\n\r\nI was scarcely more than a stripling when one morning such a sketch\r\nappeared on the walls of Paris, and considerably mystified, while it at\r\nthe same time amused the inhabitants of the capital. It was not the work\r\nof what we in England would call a \"seascape and mackerel artist,\" for\r\nno such individual stood by to ask toll of the admirers; it was not an\r\nadvertisement, for in those days that mode of mural publicity was\r\nscarcely born, let alone in its infancy, in Paris. What, then, was this\r\ncolossal, monumental nose, the like of which I have only seen on the\r\nfaces of four human beings, one of whom was Hyacinth, the famous actor\r\nof the Palais-Royal, the other three being M. d'Argout, the Governor of\r\nthe Bank of France; M. de Jussieu, the Director of the Jardin des\r\nPlantes; and Lasailly, Balzac's secretary? What was this colossal nose,\r\nwith a ridiculously small head and body attached to it? The nasal organ\r\nwas certainly phenomenal, even allowing for the permissible exaggeration\r\nof the caricaturist, but it could surely not be the only title of its\r\nowner to this sudden leap into fame! Was it a performing nose, or one\r\nendowed with extraordinary powers of smell? I puzzled over the question\r\nfor several days, until one morning I happened to run against my old\r\ntutor, looking at the picture and laughing till the tears ran down his\r\nwrinkled cheeks. It was a positive pleasure to see him. \"C'est bien lui,\r\nc'est bien lui,\" he exclaimed; \"c'est absolument son portrait craché!\"\r\n\"Do you know the original?\" I asked. \"Mais, sans doute, je le connais,\r\nc'est un ami de mon fils, du reste, toute le monde connait Bouginier.\"\r\n\"But I do not know him,\" I protested, feeling very much ashamed of my\r\nignorance. \"Ah, you! that's quite a different thing; you do not live in\r\nthe Quartier-Latin, but everybody there knows him.\" From that moment I\r\nknew no rest until I had made the acquaintance of Bouginier, which was\r\nnot very difficult; and through him I became a frequent visitor to \"La\r\nChildebert,\" which deserves a detailed description, because, though it\r\nwas a familiar haunt to many Parisians of my time with a taste for\r\nBohemian society, I doubt whether many Englishmen, save (the late) Mr.\r\nBlanchard Jerrold and one of the Mayhews, ever set foot there, and even\r\nthey could not have seen it in its prime.\r\n\r\nBut before I deal with \"La Childebert,\" I must say a few words about\r\nBouginier, who, contrary to my expectations, owed his fame solely to his\r\n_proboscis_. He utterly disappeared from the artistic horizon in a few\r\nyears, but his features still live in the memory of those who knew him\r\nthrough a statuette in _terra cotta_ modelled by Dantan the younger.\r\nDuring the reign of Louis-Philippe, Dantan took to that branch of art as\r\na relaxation from his more serious work; he finally abandoned it after\r\nhe had made Madame Malibran burst into tears, instead of making her\r\nlaugh, as he intended, at her own caricature. Those curious in such\r\nmatters may see Bouginier's presentment in a medallion on the\r\nfrontispiece of the Passage du Caire, amidst the Egyptian divinities and\r\nsphinxes. As a matter of course, the spectator asks himself why this\r\nmodern countenance should find itself in such incongruous company, and\r\nhe comes almost naturally to the conclusion that Bouginier was the\r\nowner, or perhaps the architect, of this arcade, almost exclusively\r\ntenanted--until very recently--by lithographers, printers, etc. The\r\nconclusion, however, would be an erroneous one. Bouginier, as far as is\r\nknown, never had any property in Paris or elsewhere; least of all was he\r\nvain enough to perpetuate his own features in that manner, even if he\r\nhad had an opportunity, but he had not; seeing that he was not an\r\narchitect, but simply a painter, of no great talents certainly, but,\r\nwithal, modest and sensible, and as such opposed to, or at any rate not\r\nsharing, the crazes of mediævalism, romanticism, and other _isms_ in\r\nwhich the young painters of that day indulged, and which they thought\r\nfit to emphasize in public and among one another by eccentricities of\r\ncostume and language, supposed to be in harmony with the periods they\r\nhad adopted for illustration. This absence of enthusiasm one way or the\r\nother aroused the ire of his fellow-lodgers at the \"Childebert,\" and one\r\nof them, whose pencil was more deft at that kind of work than those of\r\nthe others, executed their vengeance, and drew Bouginier's picture on\r\nthe \"fag end\" of a dead wall in the vicinity of the Church of St.\r\nGermain-des-Prés. The success was instantaneous and positively\r\noverwhelming, though truth compels one to state that this was the only\r\nflash of genius that illumined that young fellow's career. His name was\r\nFourreau, and one looks in vain for his name in the biographical\r\ndictionaries or encyclopedias of artists. Fate has even been more cruel\r\nto him than to his model.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, the success, as I have already said, was\r\noverwhelming. In less than a fortnight there was not a single wall in\r\nParis and its outskirts without a Bouginier on its surface. Though Paris\r\nwas considerably less in area than it is now, it wanted a Herculean\r\neffort to accomplish this. No man, had he been endowed with as many arms\r\nas Briareus, would have sufficed for it. Nor would it have done to trust\r\nto more or less skilful copyists--they might have failed to catch the\r\nlikeness, which was really an admirable one; so the following device was\r\nhit upon. Fourreau himself cut a number of stencil plates in brown\r\npaper, and, provided with them, an army of Childebertians started every\r\nnight in various directions, Fourreau and a few undoubtedly clever\r\nyouths heading the detachments, and filling in the blanks by hand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile summer had come, and with it the longing among the young\r\nTintos to breathe the purer air of the country, to sniff the salt\r\nbreezes of the ocean. As a matter of course, they were not all ready to\r\nstart at the same time, but being determined to follow the same route,\r\nto assemble at a common goal, the contingent that was to leave a\r\nfortnight later than the first arranged to join the others wherever they\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\n\"But how?\" was the question of those who were left behind. \"Very simply\r\nindeed,\" was the answer; \"we'll go by the Barrière d'Italie. You'll have\r\nbut to look at the walls along the road, and you'll find your waybill.\"\r\n\r\nSo said, so done. A fortnight after, the second division left\r\nhead-quarters and made straight for the Barrière d'Italie. But when\r\noutside the gates they stood undecided. For one moment only. The next\r\nthey caught sight of a magnificent Bouginier on a wall next to the\r\nexcise office--of a Bouginier whose outstretched index pointed to the\r\nFontainebleau road. After that, all went well. As far as Marseilles\r\ntheir Bouginier no more failed them than the clouds of smoke and fire\r\nfailed the Israelites in the wilderness. At the seaport town they lost\r\nthe track for a little while, rather through their want of faith in the\r\ningenuity of their predecessors than through the latter's lack of such\r\ningenuity. They had the Mediterranean in front of them, and even if they\r\nfound a Bouginier depicted somewhere on the shore, his outstretched\r\nindex could only point to the restless waves; he could do nothing more\r\ndefinite. Considerably depressed, they were going down the Cannebière,\r\nwhen they caught sight of the features of their guiding star on a panel\r\nbetween the windows of a shipping office. His outstretched index did\r\nnot point this time; it was placed over a word, and that word spelt\r\n\"Malta.\" They took ship as quickly as possible for the ancient\r\nhabitation of the Knights-Templars. On the walls of the Customs in the\r\nisland was Bouginier, with a scroll issuing from his nostrils, on which\r\nwas inscribed the word \"Alexandria.\" A similar indication met their gaze\r\nat the Pyramids, and at last the second contingent managed to come up\r\nwith the first amidst the ruins of Thebes at the very moment when the\r\nword \"Suez\" was being traced as issuing from Bouginier's mouth.\r\n\r\nAmong the company was a young fellow of the name of Berthier, who became\r\nsubsequently an architect of some note. The Passage du Caire, as I have\r\nalready observed, was in those days the head-quarters of the\r\nlithographic-printing business in general, but there was one branch\r\nwhich flourished more than the rest, namely, that of _lettres de faire\r\npart_,[1] menus of restaurants and visiting-cards. The two first-named\r\ndocuments were, in common with most printed matter intended for\r\ncirculation, subject to a stamp duty, but in the early days of the\r\nSecond Empire Louis-Napoléon had it taken off. To mark their sense of\r\nthe benefit conferred, the lithographic firms[2] determined to have the\r\narcade, which stood in sad need of repair, restored, and Berthier was\r\nselected for the task. The passage was originally built to commemorate\r\nBonaparte's victories in Egypt, and when Berthier received the\r\ncommission, he could think of no more fitting façade than the\r\nreproduction of a house at Karnac. He fondly remembered his youthful\r\nexcursion to the land of Pharaohs, and at the same time the image of\r\nBouginier uprose before him. That is why the presentment of the latter\r\nmay be seen up to this day on the frieze of a building in the frowsiest\r\npart of Paris.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 1: The \"lettre de faire part\" is an intimation of a\r\n         birth, marriage, or death sent to the friends, and even mere\r\n         acquaintances, of a family.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 2: The lithographers were almost the first in France\r\n         to form a co-operative society, but not in the sense of the\r\n         Rochdale pioneers, which dates from about the same period. The\r\n         Lacrampe Association was for supplying lithographic work. It\r\n         began in the Passage du Caire with ten members, and in a short\r\n         time numbered two hundred workmen.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIf I have dwelt somewhat longer on Bouginier than the importance of the\r\nsubject warranted, it was mainly to convey an idea of the spirit of\r\nmischief, of the love of practical joking, that animated most of the\r\ninmates of \"La Childebert.\" As a rule their devilries were innocent\r\nenough. The pictorial persecution of Bouginier is about the gravest\r\nthing that could be laid to their charge, and the victim, like the\r\nsensible fellow he was, rather enjoyed it than otherwise. Woe, however,\r\nto the starched bourgeois who had been decoyed into their lair, or even\r\nto the remonstrating comrade with a serious turn of mind, who wished to\r\npursue his studies in peace! His life was made a burden to him, for the\r\nvery building lent itself to all sorts of nocturnal surprises and of\r\nguerilla sorties. Elsewhere, when a man's door was shut, he might\r\nreasonably count upon a certain amount of privacy; the utmost his\r\nneighbours could do was to make a noise overhead or by his side. At the\r\n\"Childebert\" such privacy was out of the question. There was not a door\r\nthat held on its hinges, not a window that could be opened or shut at\r\nwill, not a ceiling that did not threaten constantly to crush you\r\nbeneath its weight, not a floor that was not in danger of giving way\r\nbeneath you and landing you in the room below, not a staircase that did\r\nnot shake under your very steps, however light they might be; in short,\r\nthe place was a wonderful illustration of \"how the rotten may hold\r\ntogether,\" even if it be not gently handled.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the structure, as it stood then, was wrapt in mystery. It\r\nwas five or six stories high, and must have attained that altitude\r\nbefore the first Revolution, because the owner, a Madame Legendre, who\r\nbought it for assignats amounting in real value to about one pound\r\nsterling, when the clergy's property was sold by the nation, was known\r\nnever to have spent a penny upon it either at the time of the purchase\r\nor subsequently, until she was forced by a tenant more ingenious or more\r\ndesperate than the rest. That it could not have been part of the abbey\r\nand adjacent monastery built by Childebert I., who was buried there in\r\n558, was very certain. It is equally improbable that the Cardinal de\r\nBissy, who opened a street upon the site of the erstwhile abbey in the\r\nyear of Louis XIV.'s death, would have erected so high a pile for the\r\nmere accommodation of the pensioners of the former monastery, at a time\r\nwhen high piles were the exception. Besides, the Nos. 1 and 3, known to\r\nhave been occupied by those pensioners, all of whose rooms communicated\r\nwith one another, were not more than two stories high. In short, the\r\noriginal intention of the builder of the house No. 9, yclept \"La\r\nChildebert,\" has never been explained. The only tenant in the Rue\r\nChildebert who might have thrown a light on the subject had died before\r\nthe caravansary attained its fame. He was more than a hundred years old,\r\nand had married five times. His fifth wife was only eighteen when she\r\nbecame Madame Chanfort, and survived him for many, many years. She was a\r\nvery worthy soul, a downright providence to the generally impecunious\r\npainters, whom she used to feed at prices which even then were\r\nridiculously low. Three eggs, albeit fried in grease instead of butter,\r\nfor the sum of three-half-pence, and a dinner, including wine, for\r\nsixpence, could not have left much profit; but Madame Chanfort always\r\ndeclared that she had enough to live upon, and that she supplied the\r\nart-students with food at cost price because she would not be without\r\ntheir company. At her death, in '57, two years before the \"Childebert\"\r\nand the street of the same name disappeared, there was a sale of her\r\nchattels, and over a hundred portraits and sketches of her, \"in her\r\nhabit as she lived,\" came under the hammer. To show that the various\r\noccupants of \"La Childebert\" could do more than make a noise and play\r\npractical jokes, I may state that not a single one of these productions\r\nfetched less than fifty francs--mere crayon studies; while there were\r\nseveral that sold for two hundred and three hundred francs, and two\r\nstudies in oil brought respectively eight hundred francs and twelve\r\nhundred francs. Nearly every one of the young men who had signed these\r\nportraits had made a name for himself. The latter two were signed\r\nrespectively Paul Delaroche and Tony Johannot.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to those whose love of peace and quietude was stronger\r\nthan their artistic instincts and watchful admiration of budding genius,\r\nthe neighbourhood of \"La Childebert\" was a sore and grievous trial. At\r\ntimes the street itself, not a very long or wide one, was like\r\nPandemonium let loose; it was when there was an \"At Home\" at \"La\r\nChildebert,\" and such functions were frequent, especially at the\r\nbeginning of the months. These gatherings, as a rule, partook of the\r\nnature of fancy dress _conversaziones_; for dancing, owing to the\r\nshakiness of the building, had become out of the question, even with\r\nsuch dare-devils as the tenants. What the latter prided themselves upon\r\nmost was their strict adherence to the local colour of the periods they\r\npreferred to resuscitate. Unfortunately for the tranquillity of the\r\nneighbourhood, they pretended to carry out this revival in its smallest\r\ndetails, not only in their artistic productions, but in their daily\r\nlives. The actor who blacked himself all over to play Othello was as\r\nnothing to them in his attempted realism, because we may suppose that he\r\ngot rid of his paint before returning to the everyday world. Not so the\r\ninmates of \"La Childebert.\" They were minstrels, or corsairs, or proud\r\nand valiant knights from the moment they got up till the moment they\r\nwent to bed, and many of them even scorned to stretch their weary limbs\r\non so effeminate a contrivance as a modern mattress, but endeavoured to\r\nkeep up the illusion by lying on a rush-bestrewn floor.\r\n\r\nI am not sufficiently learned to trace these various and succeeding\r\ndisguises to their literary and theatrical causes, for it was generally\r\na new book or a new play that set the ball rolling in a certain\r\ndirection; nor can I vouch for the chronological accuracy and\r\ncompleteness of my record in that respect, but I remember some phases of\r\nthat ever-shifting masquerade. When I was a very little boy, I was\r\nstruck more than once with the sight of young men parading the streets\r\nin doublets, trunk hose, their flowing locks adorned with velvet caps\r\nand birds' wings, their loins girded with short swords. And yet it was\r\nnot carnival time. No one seemed to take particular notice of them; the\r\nParisians by that time had probably got used to their vagaries. Those\r\ncompetent in such matters have since told me that the \"get-up\" was\r\ninspired by \"La Gaule Poétique\" of M. de Marchangy, the novels of M.\r\nd'Arlincourt, and the kindred stilted literature that characterized the\r\nbeginning of the Restoration. Both these gentlemen, from their very\r\nhatred of the Greeks and Romans of the first Empire, created heroes of\r\nfiction still more ridiculous than the latter, just as Metternich,\r\nthrough his weariness of the word \"fraternity,\" said that if he had a\r\nbrother he would call him \"cousin.\" A few years later, the first\r\ntranslation of Byron's works produced its effect; and then came\r\nDefauconpret, with his very creditable French versions of Walter Scott.\r\nThe influence of Paul Delaroche and his co-champions of the cause of\r\nromanticism, the revolution of July, the dramas of Alexandre Dumas and\r\nVictor Hugo, all added their quota to the prevailing confusion in the\r\nmatter of style and period, and early in the forties there were at the\r\n\"Childebert\" several camps, fraternizing in everything save in their\r\ndress and speech, which were the visible and audible manifestation of\r\ntheir individual predilection for certain periods of history. For\r\ninstance, it was no uncommon thing to hear the son of a concierge, whose\r\nreal or fancied vocation had made him embrace the artistic profession,\r\nswear by \"the faith of his ancestors,\" while the impoverished scion of a\r\nnoble house replied by calling him \"a bloated reminiscence of a feudal\r\nand superstitious age.\"\r\n\r\nAt the _conversaziones_ which I mentioned just now, the guests of the\r\ninmates of \"La Childebert\" not only managed to out-Herod Herod in\r\ndiction and attire, but, to heighten illusion still further, adopted as\r\nfar as possible the mode of conveyance supposed to have been employed by\r\ntheir prototypes. The classicists, and those still addicted to the\r\nillustration of Greek and Roman mythology, though nominally in the\r\nminority at the \"Childebert\" itself, were, as a rule, most successful in\r\nthose attempts. The ass that had borne Silenus, the steeds that had\r\ndrawn the chariot of the triumphant Roman warrior, the she-goat that was\r\nsupposed to have suckled Jupiter, were as familiar to the inhabitants of\r\nthe Rue Childebert as the cats and mongrels of their own households. The\r\nobstructions caused by the former no longer aroused their ire; but when,\r\none evening, Romulus and Remus made their appearance, accompanied by the\r\nlegendary she-wolf, they went mad with terror. The panic was at its\r\nheight when, with an utter disregard of mythological tradition, Hercules\r\nwalked up the street, leading the Nemæan lion. Then the aid of the\r\npolice was invoked; but neither the police nor the national guards, who\r\ncame after them, dared to tackle the animals, though they might have\r\ndone so safely, because the supposed wolf was a great dane, and the lion\r\na mastiff, but so marvellously padded and painted as to deceive any but\r\nthe most practised eye. The culprits, however, did not reveal the secret\r\nuntil they were at the commissary of police's office, enjoying the\r\nmagnificent treat of setting the whole of the neighbourhood in an uproar\r\non their journey thither, and of frightening that official on their\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nIn fact, long before I knew them, the inmates of the \"Childebert\" had\r\nbecome a positive scourge to the neighbourhood, while the structure\r\nitself threatened ruin to everything around it. Madame Legendre\r\nabsolutely refused to do any repairs. She did not deny that she had\r\nbought the place cheap, but she pointed out at the same time that the\r\nrents she charged were more than modest, and that eight times out of\r\nten she did not get them. In the beginning of her ownership she had\r\nemployed a male concierge, to prevent, as it were, the wholesale\r\nflitting which was sure to follow a more strenuous application for\r\narrears upon which she ventured now and then in those days. That was\r\ntowards the end of the Empire, when the disciples of David had been\r\nreduced to a minority in the place by those of Lethière, who sounded the\r\nfirst note of revolt against the unconditional classicism of the\r\nillustrious member of the Convention. If all the disciples of the Creole\r\npainter had not his genius, most of them had his courage and readiness\r\nto draw the sword on the smallest provocation,[3] and the various\r\nCerberi employed by Madame Legendre to enforce her claims had to fly one\r\nafter another. The rumour of the danger of the situation had spread, and\r\nat last Madame Legendre could find no man to fill it, except on monetary\r\nconditions with which she would not--perhaps could not--comply. From\r\nthat day forth she employed a woman, who was safe, because she had been\r\ntold to let \"lawless impecuniosity\" take its course, and it was recorded\r\nthat pecuniarily the proprietress was the better off for this change of\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 3: Guillaume Lethière, whose real name was Guillon,\r\n         was a native of Guadeloupe. He fought and seriously wounded\r\n         several officers because the latter had objected to \"a mere\r\n         dauber wearing moustaches.\" He was obliged to leave Paris, but,\r\n         thanks to the protection of Lucien Bonaparte, was appointed\r\n         Director of the French Académie at Rome.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nI am willing to repeat that record, which, if true, did credit to the\r\nhead of the landlady and the hearts of her tenants, but am compelled to\r\nsupplement it by a different version. When I saw the \"Childebert\" in '37\r\nor '38, no man in his senses would have paid rent for any one room in it\r\non the two top stories; he might as well have lived in the streets. It\r\nwas an absolute case of the bottomless sedan chair in which two of his\r\nfellow-porters put Pat; \"but for the honour of the thing, he might have\r\nwalked.\" Consequently the tenants there were rarely harassed for their\r\nrent; if they paid it at all, it was so much unexpected gain. It\r\nhappened, however, that now and then by mistake a youngster was put\r\nthere who had scruples about discharging his liabilities in that\r\nrespect; and one of these was Émile Lapierre, who subsequently became a\r\nlandscape-painter of note. One night, after he had taken up his quarters\r\nthere, the floodgates of heaven opened over Paris. Lapierre woke up\r\namidst a deluge. I need not say that there were no bells at the\r\n\"Childebert;\" nevertheless there was no fear of dying unattended,\r\nprovided one could shout, for there was always a party turning night\r\ninto day, or hailing the smiling morn before turning in. Lapierre's\r\nshouts found a ready echo, and in a few moments the old concierge was on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\n\"Go and fetch a boat--go and fetch a boat!\" yelled Lapierre. \"I am\r\ndrowning!\" yelled Lapierre.\r\n\r\n\"There are none in the quarter,\" replied the old woman innocently,\r\nthinking he was in earnest.\r\n\r\n\"Then go and fetch Madame Legendre, to show her the pond she is letting\r\nme instead of the room for which I pay her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame would not come, not even for you, monsieur, who are the only one\r\npunctual with your rent; besides, if she did come, she would have no\r\nrepairs done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she'll have no repairs done! We'll soon find out. I think I'll make\r\nher,\" screamed Lapierre; and he kept his word.\r\n\r\nIt was the only instance of Madame Legendre having had to capitulate,\r\nand I have alluded to it before; it remains for me to tell how it was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nLapierre, contrary to the precept, allowed the sun to go down upon his\r\nwrath, in the hope perhaps of inducing Madame Legendre to change her\r\noft-announced decision of doing no repairs; but he rose betimes next\r\nmorning, and when there was no sign of workmen, he proceeded to carry\r\nout his plan. The floors of the \"Childebert\" were made of brick, and he\r\nsimply removed three or four squares from his, after which he went\r\ndownstairs and recruited half a dozen water-carriers, and bade them\r\nempty their full pails into the opening he had made. I shall probably\r\nhave some remarks to make elsewhere about the water-supply of Paris; at\r\npresent it is sufficient to say that in those days there was not a\r\nsingle house in the capital which was not dependent upon those\r\nAuvergnats who carried the commodity round in barrels on carts drawn by\r\nhand or horse. These gentlemen, though astonished at the strange task\r\nrequired of them, consented. In less than ten minutes there was a string\r\nof water-carts stationed in the Rue Childebert, and in a few minutes\r\nmore the lower stories were simply flooded. Aimé Millet, the sculptor,\r\nwhose room was situated immediately beneath that of Lapierre, was the\r\nfirst victim. It was he who gave the alarm, but, as a matter of course,\r\nin the twinkling of an eye there were one or two heads at every window,\r\nand though very early, there was a stampede of very primitively clad\r\nmodels (?) into the street, shouting and yelling out at the top of their\r\nvoices. Outside no one seemed to know exactly what had occurred; the\r\nprevailing impression was that the place was on fire. Then Madame\r\nLegendre was sent for in hot haste. By that time the truth had become\r\nknown in the house. The alarm had subsided, but not the noise. When the\r\nreport of Madame Legendre's coming got wind, a deputation went to the\r\nentrance of the street to welcome her. It was provided with all sorts of\r\ninstruments except musical ones, and the old dame was conducted in state\r\nto Millet's room. The cause of the mischief was soon ascertained, for\r\nthe water-carriers were still at work. The police had refused to\r\ninterfere; in reality, they would not have been sorry to see the\r\nbuilding come down with a crash, for it was as great a source of\r\nannoyance to them as to the peaceful burghers they were supposed to\r\nprotect. A move was made to the room above, where Lapierre--without a\r\nstitch of clothing--stood directing the operations.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing, Monsieur Lapierre?\" screeched Madame Legendre.\r\n\r\n\"I am taking a bath, madame; it is very warm. You gave me one against my\r\nwill the night before last; and lest I should be accused of selfishness,\r\nI am letting my neighbours partake of the pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nThat is how Madame Legendre was compelled to repair the roof of \"La\r\nChildebert.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the company amidst which I was introduced by the son of my old\r\ntutor. Many years have passed since then, during which I have been\r\nthrown into the society of the great and powerful ones of this world,\r\nrather through the force of circumstances than owing to my own merits,\r\nbut I have looked in vain for the honest friendships, the disinterested\r\nactions, the genuine enthusiasm for their art, underlying their devilry,\r\nof which these young men were capable. The bourgeois vices, in the guise\r\nof civic and domestic virtues, entered the souls of Frenchmen early in\r\nthe reign of Louis-Philippe, and have been gnawing since, with\r\never-increasing force, like a cancer, at everything that was noble and\r\nworthy of admiration in a nation. But those vices never found their way\r\nto the hearts of the inmates of \"La Childebert\" while they were there,\r\nand rarely in after-life. Many attained world-wide reputations; few\r\ngathered riches, even when they were as frugal as the best among\r\nthem--Eugène Delacroix.\r\n\r\nTo have known these young men was absolutely a liberal education. To the\r\nPodsnap and Philistine of no matter what nationality, it seems a sad\r\nthing to have no thought for to-morrow. And these youngsters had not\r\neven a thought for the day. Their thoughts were for the future, when the\r\nworld mayhap would ring with their names; but their physical or mental\r\nhearing never strained for the ring of money. They were improvident\r\ncreatures, to be sure; but how much more lovable than the young painters\r\nof the present period, whose ideal is a big balance at their bankers;\r\nwho would rather have their names inscribed on the registers of the\r\npublic debt than in the golden book of art; whose dreamt-of Eden is a\r\nbijou villa in the Parc Monceaux or in the Avenue Villiers; whose\r\nprovidence is the _richard_, the parvenu, the wealthy upstart, whose\r\nfeatures they perpetuate, regardless of the perpetuation of their own\r\nbudding fame!\r\n\r\nWhen I began to jot down these notes, I made up my mind to eschew\r\ncomparisons and moralizing; I find I have unconsciously done both, but\r\nwill endeavour not to offend again. Still, I cannot help observing how\r\nthe mere \"moneyed nobody\" rushes nowadays to the eminent painter to have\r\nhis lineaments reproduced, when a guinea photograph would serve his\r\npurpose just as well for \"family use;\" for I take it that no one,\r\nbesides his relations and friends, cares or will care to gaze upon his\r\nfeatures. And yet our annual picture exhibitions are crowded with the\r\nportraits of these nonentities. They advertise themselves through the\r\npainters that transfer them to canvas, and the latter are content to\r\npocket heavy fees, like the advertising agents they are. I am certain\r\nthat neither Holbein, Rubens, Van Dyck, Hals, nor Rembrandt would have\r\nlent themselves to such transactions. When they, or a Reynolds, a\r\nLawrence, a Gainsborough, conferred the honour of their brush upon some\r\none, it was because he or she was already distinguished from his or her\r\nfellow-creatures by beauty, social position, talents, genius, or birth;\r\nnot because he or she wanted to be, or, in default of such distinction,\r\nwanted to attract the public notice at all costs. That, I fancy, was the\r\nway in which painters of other days looked upon the thing. I know it was\r\nthe way in which the young fellows at the \"Childebert\" did; and woe to\r\ntheir comrade who ventured to apply in art the principle of\r\ninternational maritime law, that \"le pavillon couvre la marchandise\"\r\n(the flag covers the cargo)! He was scouted and jeered at, and,\r\nmoreover, rarely allowed to reap the pecuniary benefit of his artistic\r\nabasement. Hence the \"patron for a portrait\" seldom found his way to \"La\r\nChildebert.\" When he did, the whole of the place conspired to make his\r\nlife and that of his would-be _protégé_ a misery.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate all the devices resorted to to make the sittings abortive,\r\nto \"distort the features that had donned the bland smile of placid\r\ncontentment\" with the paralyzing fear of some impending catastrophe,\r\nwould be impossible; the mention of a few must suffice. That most\r\nfrequently employed, and comparatively easy of execution, was the\r\nsetting alight of damp straw; the dense smoke penetrated every nook and\r\ncranny of the crazy building, and the sitter, mad with fright, rushed\r\naway. The chances were a hundred to one against his ever returning.\r\nAnother was the intrusion of a male model offering his services as a\r\nSaint-Jérôme, or a female one offering hers as Godiva; for, curious to\r\nrelate, the devotion of the wife of Leofric of Murcia was a favourite\r\nsubject with the Childebertians. As a matter of course, the applicants\r\nwere in the costume, or rather lack of costume, appropriate to the\r\ncharacter. The strait-laced bourgeois or bourgeoise was shocked, and did\r\nnot repeat the visit. The cry that there was a mad dog in the house was\r\na common one on those occasions; and at last the would-be\r\nportrait-painters had to give in, and a big placard appeared on the\r\nfrontispiece: \"Le commerce des portraits a été cédé aux directeur et\r\nmembres de l'École des Beaux-Arts.\"\r\n\r\nThe most curious thing in connection with the \"Childebert\" was that,\r\nthough the place was inexpressibly ill kept, it escaped the most\r\nterrible visitations of the cholera. I prefer not to enter into details\r\nof the absolute disregard of all sanitary conditions, but in warm\r\nweather the building became positively uninhabitable. Long before the\r\nunsavoury spectacle of \"learned fleas\" became a feature of the suburban\r\nfairs, Émile Signol, who is best known as a painter of religious\r\nsubjects, had trained a company of performers of a different kind of\r\nnocturnal pests. He averred in his opening lecture that their ingenuity\r\nwas too great to remain unknown, and cited anecdotes fully proving his\r\nwords. Certain is it that they were the only enemies before which the\r\ncombined forces of the Childebertians proved powerless. But even under\r\nsuch trying circumstances the latter never lost their buoyant spirits,\r\nand their retreats _en masse_ were effected in a manner the reports of\r\nwhich set the whole of Paris in a roar. One Sunday morning, the faithful\r\nworshippers, going to matins at the Church of St. Germain-des-Prés,\r\nfound the square occupied by a troop of Bedouins, wrapt in their\r\nburnouses, and sleeping the sleep of the just. Some had squatted in\r\ncorners, calmly smoking their _chibouks_. This was in the days of the\r\nAlgerian campaign, and the rumour spread like wildfire that a party of\r\nArab prisoners of war were bivouacked round the church, where a special\r\nservice would be given in the afternoon as the first step to their\r\nconversion to Christianity. It being Sunday, the whole of Paris rushed\r\nto the spot. The Bedouins had, however, disappeared, but a collection\r\nwas made in their behalf by several demure-looking young men. The\r\nParisians gave liberally. That night, and two or three nights after, the\r\nnocturnal pests' occupation was gone, for the \"Childebert\" was lighted\r\n_a giorno_ from basement to roof, and the Childebertians held high\r\nfestival. The inhabitants of the streets adjacent to the Rue Childebert\r\nspent as many sleepless nights, though their houses were perfectly\r\nwholesome and clean.\r\n\r\nI had the honour to be a frequent guest at those gatherings, but I feel\r\nthat a detailed description of them is beyond my powers. I have already\r\nsaid that the craziness of the structure would have rendered extremely\r\ndangerous any combined display of choregraphic art, as practised by the\r\nChildebertians and their friends, male and female, at the neighbouring\r\nGrande-Chaumière; it did, however, not prevent a lady or gentleman of\r\nthe company from performing a _pas seul_ now and then. This, it must be\r\nremembered, was the pre-Rigolbochian period, before Chicard with his\r\n_chahut_ had been ousted from his exalted position by the more elegant\r\nand graceful evolutions of the originator of the modern cancan, the\r\nfamous Brididi; when the Faubourg du Temple, the Bal du Grand\r\nSaint-Martin, and \"the descent of the Courtille\" were patronized by the\r\nParis _jeunesse dorée_, and in their halcyon days, when the _habitués_\r\nof the establishment of Le Père Lahire considered it their greatest\r\nglory to imitate as closely as possible the bacchanalian gyrations of\r\nthe choregraphic autocrat on the other side of the Seine. No mere\r\ndescription could do justice to these gyrations; only a draughtsman of\r\nthe highest skill could convey an adequate idea of them. But, as a\r\nrule, the soirées at the \"Childebert\" were not conspicuous for such\r\ndisplays; their programme was a more ambitious one from an intellectual\r\npoint of view, albeit that the programme was rarely, if ever, carried\r\nout. This failure of the prearranged proceedings mainly arose from the\r\ndisinclination or inability of the fairer portion of the company to play\r\nthe passive part of listeners and spectators during the recital of an\r\nunpublished poem of perhaps a thousand lines or so, though the reciter\r\nwas no less a personage than the author. In vain did the less frivolous\r\nand male part of the audience claim \"silence for the minstrel;\" the\r\ninterrupters could conceive no minstrel without a guitar or some kindred\r\ninstrument, least of all a minstrel who merely spoke his words, and the\r\nfeast of reason and flow of soul came generally to an abrupt end by the\r\nrising of a damsel more outspoken still than her companions, who\r\nproposed an adjournment to one of the adjacent taverns, or to the not\r\nfar distant \"Grande-Chaumière,\" \"si on continue à nous assommer avec des\r\nvers.\" The threat invariably produced its effect. The \"minstrel\" was\r\npolitely requested to \"shut up,\" and Béranger, Desaugiers, or even M.\r\nScribe, took the place of the Victor Hugo in embryo until the small\r\nhours of the morning; the departure of the guests being witnessed by the\r\nnight-capped inhabitants of the Rue Childebert from their windows,\r\namidst the comforting reflections that for another three weeks or so\r\nthere would be peace in the festive halls of that \"accursed building.\"\r\n\r\nMy frequent visits to \"La Childebert\" had developed a taste for the\r\nBohemian attractions of the Quartier-Latin. I was not twenty, and though\r\nI caught frequent glimpses at home of some of the eminent men with whom\r\na few years later I lived on terms of friendship, I could not aspire to\r\ntheir society then. It is doubtful whether I would have done so if I\r\ncould. I preferred the Théâtre Bobino to the Opéra and the\r\nComédie-Française; the Grande-Chaumière--or the Chaumière, as it was\r\nsimply called--to the most brilliantly lighted and decorated ball-room;\r\na stroll with a couple of young students in the gardens of the\r\nLuxembourg to a carriage-drive in the Bois de Boulogne; a dinner for\r\nthree francs at Magny's, in the Rue Contrescarpe-Dauphine, or even one\r\nfor twenty-two sous at Viot's or Bléry's, to the most sumptuous repast\r\nat the Café Riche or the Café de Paris. I preferred the buttered rolls\r\nand the bowl of milk at the Boulangerie Crétaine, in the Rue Dauphine,\r\nto the best suppers at the Café Anglais, whither I had been taken once\r\nor twice during the Carnival--in short, I was very young and very\r\nfoolish; since then I have often wished that, at the risk of remaining\r\nvery foolish for evermore, I could have prolonged my youth for another\r\nscore of years.\r\n\r\nFor once in a way I have no need to be ashamed of my want of memory. I\r\ncould not give an account of a single piece I saw during those two or\r\nthree years at Bobino, but I am certain that not one of the companions\r\nof my youth could. It is not because the lapse of time has dimmed the\r\nrecollection of the plots, but because there were no plots, or at any\r\nrate none that we could understand, and I doubt very much whether the\r\nactors and actresses were more enlightened in that respect than the\r\naudience. The pieces were vaudevilles, most of them, and it was\r\nsufficient for us to join in the choruses of the songs, with which they\r\nwere plentifully interlarded. As for the dialogue, it might have been\r\nsparkling with wit and epigram; it was nearly always drowned by\r\ninterpolations from one side of the house or the other. When the tumult\r\nbecame too great, the curtain was simply lowered, to be almost\r\nimmediately raised, \"discovering\" the manager--in his dressing-gown. He\r\nseemed prouder of that piece of attire than the more modern one would be\r\nof the most faultless evening dress. He never appealed to us by invoking\r\nthe laws of politeness; he never threatened to have the house cleared.\r\nHe simply pointed out to us that the police would inevitably close the\r\nplace at the request of the inhabitants of the Rue de Madame if the\r\nnoise rose above a certain pitch, and disturbed their peaceful evening\r\nhours, spent in the bosom of their families; which remark was always\r\nfollowed by the audience intoning as one man Gretry's \"Où peut-on être\r\nmieux qu'au sein de sa famille?\" the orchestra--such an\r\norchestra!--playing the accompaniment, and the manager himself beating\r\ntime. Then he went on. \"Yes, messieurs et mesdames, we are here en\r\nfamille also, as much en famille as at the Grande-Chaumière; and has not\r\nM. Lahire obtained from the Government the permission de faire sa police\r\ntout seul! After all, he is providing exercise for your muscles; I am\r\nproviding food for your brain.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech was a stereotyped one--we all knew it by heart; it invariably\r\nproduced its effect in keeping us comparatively quiet for the rest of\r\nthe evening, unless a bourgeois happened to come in. Then the uproar\r\nbecame uncontrollable; no managerial speech could quell it until the\r\nintruder had left the theatre.\r\n\r\nBy a bourgeois was meant a man who wore broadcloth and a top hat, but\r\nespecially the latter. In fact, that headgear was rarely seen within the\r\ninner precincts of the Quartier-Latin, even during the daytime, except\r\non the head of a professor, or on Thursdays when the collegians--the\r\nterm \"lycéen\" was not invented--were taken for their weekly outing. The\r\nsemi-military dress of the present time had not been thought of then.\r\nThe collegian wore a top hat, like our Eton boys, a white necktie, a\r\nkind of black quaker coat with a stand-up collar, a very dark blue\r\nwaistcoat and trousers, low shoes, and blue woollen stockings. In the\r\nsummer, some of them, especially those of the Collége Rollin, had a\r\nwaistcoat and trousers of a lighter texture, and drab instead of blue.\r\nThey were virtually prisoners within the walls of the college all the\r\nweek, for in their Thursday promenades they were little more than\r\nprisoners taking exercise under the supervision of their gaolers. They\r\nwere allowed to leave on alternate Sundays, provided they had parents,\r\nrelations, or friends in Paris, who could come themselves or send their\r\nservants to fetch them in the morning and take them back at night. The\r\nrule applied to all, whether they were nine or double that number of\r\nyears; it prevails even now. I only set foot in a French college of\r\nthose days twice to see a young friend of mine, and I thanked my stars\r\nthat four or five years of that existence had been spared to me. The\r\nfood and the table appointments, the bedrooms--they were more like cells\r\nwith their barred windows--would have been declined by the meanest\r\nEnglish servant, certainly by the meanest French one. I have never met\r\nwith a Frenchman who looks back with fond remembrance on his\r\nschool-days.\r\n\r\nThe evening was generally wound up with a supper at Dagneaux's,\r\nPinson's, or at the rôtisseuse--that is, if the evening happened to fall\r\nwithin the first ten days of the month; afterwards the entertainment\r\nnearly always consisted of a meat-pie, bought at one of the\r\ncharcutiers', and washed down with the bottles of wine purchased at the\r\nHôtel de l'Empereur Joseph II., at the south-eastern angle of the Rue de\r\nTournon, where it stands still. The legend ran that the brother of Marie\r\nAntoinette had stayed there while on a visit to Paris, but it is\r\nscarcely likely that he would have done so while his sister was within\r\na step of the throne of France; nevertheless the Count von\r\nFalkenstein--which was the name he adopted when travelling\r\nincognito--was somewhat of a philosopher. Did not he once pay a visit to\r\nJean-Jacques Rousseau without having apprised him of his call?\r\nJean-Jacques was copying music as the door opened to let in the visitor,\r\nand felt flattered enough, we may be sure; not so Buffon, whom Joseph\r\nsurprised under similar circumstances, and who could never forgive\r\nhimself for having been caught in his dressing-gown--he who never sat\r\ndown to work except in lace ruffles and frill.\r\n\r\nIf I have been unwittingly betrayed into a semi-historical disquisition,\r\nit is because almost every step in that quarter gave rise to one, even\r\namongst those light-hearted companions of mine, to the great\r\nastonishment of the fairer portion of the company. They only took an\r\ninterest in the biography of one of the inhabitants of the street,\r\nwhether past or present, and that was in the biography of Mdlle.\r\nLenormand, a well-known fortune-teller, who lived at No. 5. They had\r\nheard that the old woman, who had been the mistress of Hébert of \"Père\r\nDuchesne\" fame, had, during the First Revolution, predicted to Joséphine\r\nde Beauharnais that she should be empress, as some gipsy at Grenada\r\npredicted a similar elevation to Eugénie de Montijo many years\r\nafterwards. Mdlle. Lenormand had been imprisoned after Hébert's death,\r\nbut the moment Napoléon became first consul she was liberated, and\r\nfrequently sent for to the Luxembourg, which is but a stone's throw from\r\nthe Rue de Tournon. As a matter of course her fame spread, and she made\r\na great deal of money during the first empire. Ignorant as they were of\r\nhistory, the sprightly grisettes of our days had heard of that; their\r\ngreat ambition was to get the five francs that would open the door of\r\nMdlle. Lenormand's to them. Mdlle. Lenormand died about the year '43.\r\nJules Janin, who lived in the same street, in the house formerly\r\ninhabited by Théroigne de Méricourt, went to the fortune-teller's\r\nfuneral. The five francs so often claimed by the _étudiante_, so rarely\r\nforthcoming from the pockets of her admirer, was an important sum in\r\nthose days among the youth of the Quartier-Latin. There were few whose\r\nallowance exceeded two hundred francs per month. A great many had to do\r\nwith less. Those who were in receipt of five hundred francs--perhaps not\r\ntwo score among the whole number--were scarcely considered as belonging\r\nto the fraternity. They were called \"ultrapontins,\" to distinguish them\r\nfrom those who from one year's end to another never crossed the river,\r\nexcept perhaps to go to one of the theatres, because there was not much\r\nto be seen at the Odéon during the thirties. With Harel's migration to\r\nthe Porte St. Martin, the glory of the second Théâtre-Français had\r\ndeparted, and it was not until '41 that Lireux managed to revive some of\r\nits ancient fame. By that time I had ceased to go to the Quartier-Latin,\r\nbut Lireux was a familiar figure at the Café Riche and at the divan of\r\nthe Rue Le Peletier; he dined now and then at the Café de Paris. So we\r\nmade it a point to attend every one of his first nights, notwithstanding\r\nthe warnings in verse and in prose of every wit of Paris, Théophile\r\nGautier included, who had written:\r\n\r\n  \"On a fait là dessus mille plaisanteries,\r\n   Je le sais; il poussait de l'herbe aux galeries;\r\n   Trente-six variétés de champignons malsains\r\n   Dans les loges tigraient la mousse des coussins.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to say anything very spiteful of a theatre which had\r\nremained almost empty during a gratuitous performance on the king's\r\nbirthday; consequently while I frequented the Quartier-Latin the\r\nstudents gave it a wide berth. When they were not disporting themselves\r\nat Bobino, they were at the Chaumière, and not in the evening only.\r\nNotwithstanding the enthusiastic and glowing descriptions of it that\r\nhave appeared in later days, the place was simple enough. There was a\r\nprimitive shooting-gallery, a skittle-alley, and so forth, and it was\r\nopen all day. The students, after having attended the lectures and taken\r\na stroll in the gardens of the Luxembourg, repaired to the Chaumière,\r\nwhere, in fine weather, they were sure to find their \"lady-loves\"\r\nsitting at work demurely under the trees. The refreshments were cheap,\r\nand one spent one's time until the dinner hour, chatting, singing, or\r\nstrolling about. The students were very clannish, and invariably\r\nremained in their own sets at the Chaumière. There were tables\r\nexclusively occupied by Bourguignons, Angevins, etc. In fact, life was\r\naltogether much simpler and more individual than it became later on.\r\n\r\nOne of our great treats was an excursion to the establishment of Le Père\r\nBonvin, where the student of to-day would not condescend to sit down,\r\nalbeit that the food he gets in more showy places is not half as good\r\nand three times as dear. Le Père Bonvin was popularly supposed to be in\r\nthe country, though it was not more than a mile from the Barrière\r\nMontparnasse. The \"country\" was represented by one or two large but\r\nstraggling plots of erstwhile grazing-lands, but at that time dotted\r\nwith chalk-pits, tumble-down wooden shanties, etc. Such trees as the\r\ntract of \"country\" could boast were on the demesne of Père Bonvin, but\r\nthey evidently felt out of their element, and looked the reverse of\r\nflourishing. The house of Père Bonvin was scarcely distinguished in\r\ncolour and ricketiness from the neighbouring constructions, but it was\r\nbuilt of stone, and had two stories. The fare was homely and genuine,\r\nthe latter quality being no small recommendation to an establishment\r\nwhere the prolific \"bunny\" was the usual _plat de résistance_. For\r\nsophistication, where the rabbit was concerned, was part of the suburban\r\ntraiteur's creed from time immemorial, and the fact of the former's head\r\nbeing visible in the dish was no guarantee as to that and the body by\r\nits side having formed one whole in the flesh. The ubiquitous collector\r\nof rags and bottles and rabbits' skins was always anxiously inquiring\r\nfor the heads also, and the natural conclusion was that, thanks to the\r\nlatter, stewed grimalkin passed muster as gibelotte. At Père Bonvin's no\r\nsuch suspicion could be entertained for one moment; the visitor was\r\nadmitted to inspect his dinner while alive. Père Bonvin was essentially\r\nan honest man, and a character in his way. During the daytime he\r\nexercised the functions of garde-champêtre; at night he became the\r\nrestaurateur.\r\n\r\nIn those days both his sons, François and Léon, were still at home, but\r\nthe former had apparently already made up his mind not to follow in his\r\nsire's footsteps. He was a compositor by trade, but the walls of the\r\nvarious rooms showed plainly enough that he did not aim at the fame of\r\nan Aldine or an Elzevir, but at that of a Jan Steen or a Gerard Dow. He\r\nhas fully maintained the promise given then. His pictures rank high in\r\nthe modern French school; there are few of his contemporaries who have\r\nso thoroughly caught the spirit of the Dutch masters. Léon was a mere\r\nlad, but a good many among the _habitués_ of Père Bonvin predicted a\r\nmore glorious career for him than for his brother. The word \"heaven-born\r\nmusician\" has been often misapplied; in Léon's instance it was fully\r\njustified. The predictions, however, were not realized. Whether from\r\nlack of confidence in his own powers, or deterred by the never-ceasing\r\nremonstrances of his father, Léon, unlike François, did not strike out\r\nfor himself, but continued to assist in the business, only turning to\r\nhis harmonium in his spare time, or towards the end of the evening, when\r\nall distinction between guests and hosts ceased to exist, and the whole\r\nmade a very happy family. He married early. I lost sight of him\r\naltogether, until about '64 I heard of his tragic end. He had committed\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     My introduction to the celebrities of the day -- The Café de\r\n     Paris -- The old Prince Demidoff -- The old man's mania -- His\r\n     sons -- The furniture and attendance at the Café de Paris -- Its\r\n     high prices -- A mot of Alfred de Musset -- The cuisine -- A\r\n     rebuke of the proprietor to Balzac -- A version by one of his\r\n     predecessors of the cause of Vatel's suicide -- Some of the\r\n     _habitués_ -- Their intercourse with the attendants -- Their\r\n     courteous behaviour towards one another -- Le veau à la casserole\r\n     -- What Alfred de Musset, Balzac, and Alexandre Dumas thought of\r\n     it -- A silhouette of Alfred de Musset -- His brother Paul on his\r\n     election as a member of the Académie -- A silhouette of Balzac,\r\n     between sunset and sunrise -- A curious action against the\r\n     publishers of an almanack -- A full-length portrait of Balzac --\r\n     His pecuniary embarrassments -- His visions of wealth and\r\n     speculations -- His constant neglect of his duties as a National\r\n     Guard -- His troubles in consequence thereof -- L'Hôtel des\r\n     Haricots -- Some of his fellow-prisoners -- Adam, the composer of\r\n     \"Le Postillon de Lonjumeau\" -- Eugène Sue; his portrait -- His\r\n     dandyism -- The origin of the Paris Jockey Club -- Eugène Sue\r\n     becomes a member -- The success of \"Les Mystères de Paris\" -- The\r\n     origin of \"Le Juif-Errant\" -- Sue makes himself objectionable to\r\n     the members of the Jockey Club -- His name struck off the list --\r\n     His decline and disappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf these notes are ever published, the reader will gather from the\r\nforegoing that, unlike many Englishmen brought up in Paris, I was\r\nallowed from a very early age to mix with all sorts and conditions of\r\nmen. As I intend to say as little as possible about myself, there is no\r\nnecessity to reveal the reason of this early emancipation from all\r\nrestraint, which resulted in my being on familiar terms with a great\r\nmany celebrities before I had reached my twenty-first year. I had no\r\nclaim on their goodwill beyond my admiration of their talents and the\r\nfact of being decently connected. The constant companion of my youth was\r\nhand and glove with some of the highest in the land, and, if the truth\r\nmust be told, with a good many of the lowest; but the man who was seated\r\nat the table of Lord Palmerston at the Café de Paris at 8 p.m., could\r\nafford _de s'encanailler_ at 2 a.m. next morning without jeopardizing\r\nhis social status.\r\n\r\nThe Café de Paris in those days was probably not only the best\r\nrestaurant in Paris, but the best in Europe. Compared to the \"Frères\r\nProvençaux\" Véfour and Véry, the Café de Paris was young; it was only\r\nopened on July 15, 1822, in the vast suite of apartments at the corner\r\nof the Rue Taitbout and Boulevard de Italiens, formerly occupied by\r\nPrince Demidoff, whose grandson was a prominent figure in the society of\r\nthe Second Empire, and whom I knew personally. The grandfather died\r\nbefore I was born, or, at any rate, when I was very young; but his\r\ndescendant often told me about him and his two sons, Paul and Anatole,\r\nboth of whom, in addition to his vast wealth, inherited a good many of\r\nhis eccentricities. The old man, like many Russian grand seigneurs, was\r\nnever so happy as when he could turn his back upon his own country. He\r\ninhabited Paris and Florence in turns. In the latter place he kept in\r\nhis pay a company of French actors, who were lodged in a magnificent\r\nmansion near to his own, and who enacted comedies, vaudevilles, and\r\ncomic operas. The London playgoer may remember a piece in which the\r\ncelebrated Ravel made a great sensation; it was entitled \"Les Folies\r\nDramatiques,\" and was founded upon the mania of the old man. For he was\r\nold before his time and racked with gout, scarcely able to set his feet\r\nto the ground. He had to be wheeled in a chair to his entertainments and\r\ntheatre, and often fell into a dead faint in the middle of the\r\nperformance or during the dinner. \"It made no difference to his guests,\"\r\nsaid his grandson; \"they wheeled him out as they had wheeled him in, and\r\nthe play or repast went on as if nothing had happened.\" In fact, it\r\nwould seem that the prince would have been very angry if they had acted\r\notherwise, for his motto was that, next to enjoying himself, there was\r\nnothing so comfortable as to see others do so. Faithful to this\r\nprinciple, he always kept some one near, whose mission it was to enjoy\r\nhimself at his expense. He was under no obligation whatsoever, except to\r\ngive an account of his amusements, most frequently in the dead of the\r\nnight, when he got home, because the old prince suffered from insomnia;\r\nhe would have given the whole of his vast possessions for six hours'\r\nunbroken slumber.\r\n\r\nI have an idea that the three generations of these Demidoffs were as mad\r\nas March hares, though I am bound to say, at the same time, that the\r\nform this madness took hurt no one. Personally, I only knew Prince\r\nAnatole, the second son of the old man, and Paul, the latter's nephew.\r\nPaul's father, of the same name, died almost immediately after his son's\r\nbirth. He had a mania for travelling, and rarely stayed in the same\r\nspot for forty-eight hours. He was always accompanied by a numerous\r\nsuite and preceded by a couple of couriers, who, nine times out of ten,\r\nhad orders to engage every room in the hotel for him. Being very rich\r\nand as lavish as he was wealthy, few hotel proprietors scrupled to turn\r\nout the whole of their guests at his steward's bidding and at a moment's\r\nnotice. Of course, people refused to put up with such cavalier\r\ntreatment; but as remonstrance was of no avail, they often brought\r\nactions for damages, which they invariably gained, and were promptly\r\nsettled by Boniface, who merely added them to Prince Paul's bill. The\r\nmost comical part of the business, however, was that the prince as often\r\nas not changed his mind on arriving at the hotel, and without as much as\r\nalighting, continued his journey. The bill was never disputed. Another\r\nof his manias was that his wife should wash her hands each time she\r\ntouched a metal object. For a while Princess Demidoff humoured her\r\nhusband, but she found this so terribly irksome that she at last decided\r\nto wear gloves, and continued to do so long after her widowhood.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious to the reader that this digression has little or no\r\n_raison d'être_, even in notes that do not profess to tell a succinct\r\nstory; but my purpose was to a certain extent to vindicate the character\r\nof one of the most charming women of her time, who had the misfortune to\r\nmarry what was undoubtedly the most eccentric member of the family. I am\r\nreferring to Princess Anatole Demidoff, _née_ Bonaparte, the daughter of\r\nJérôme, and the sister of Plon-Plon.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Café de Paris and its _habitués_. First of all, the\r\nplace itself was unlike any other restaurant of that day, even unlike\r\nits neighbour and rival, the Café Hardi, at the corner of the Rue\r\nLaffitte, on the site of the present Maison d'Or. There was no undue\r\ndisplay of white and gold; and \"the epicure was not constantly reminded\r\nthat, when in the act of eating, he was not much superior to the rest of\r\nhumanity,\" as Lord Palmerston put it when commenting upon the welcome\r\nabsence of mirrors. The rooms might have been transformed at a moment's\r\nnotice into private apartments for a very fastidious, refined family;\r\nfor, in addition to the tasteful and costly furniture, it was the only\r\nestablishment of its kind in Paris that was carpeted throughout, instead\r\nof having merely sanded or even polished floors, as was the case even in\r\nsome of the best Paris restaurants as late as five and six years ago (I\r\nmean in the seventies)--Bignon, the Café Foy, and the Lion d'Or, in the\r\nRue du Helder, excepted. The attendance was in every respect in thorough\r\nkeeping with the grand air of the place, and, albeit that neither of the\r\nthree or four succeeding proprietors made a fortune, or anything\r\napproaching it, was never relaxed.\r\n\r\nOn looking over these notes, I am afraid that the last paragraph will be\r\nintelligible only to a small section of my readers, consequently I\r\nventure to explain. Improved communication has brought to Paris during\r\nthe third quarter of the century a great many Englishmen who, not being\r\nvery familiar either with French or with French customs in their better\r\naspect, have come to look upon the stir and bustle of the ordinary Paris\r\nrestaurant, upon the somewhat free-and-easy behaviour of the waiters,\r\nupon their eccentricities of diction, upon their often successful\r\nattempts at \"swelling\" the total of the dinner-bill as so much matter of\r\ncourse. The abbreviated nomenclature the waiter employs in\r\nrecapitulating the bill of fare to the patron is regarded by him as\r\nmerely a skilful handling of the tongue by the native; the chances are\r\nten to one in favour of the patron trying to imitate the same in his\r\norders to the attendant, and deriving a certain pride from being\r\nsuccessful. The stir and bustle is attributed to the more lively\r\ntemperament of our neighbours, the free-and-easy behaviour as a wish on\r\nthe waiter's part to smooth the linguistically thorny path of the\r\nbenighted foreigner, the attempt to multiply items as an irrepressible\r\nmanifestation of French greed.\r\n\r\nWherever these things occur, nowadays, the patron may be certain that he\r\nis \"in the wrong shop;\" but in the days of which I treat, the wrong shop\r\nwas legion, especially as far as the foreigner was concerned; the Café\r\nde Paris and the Café Hardi were the notable exceptions. Truly, as\r\nAlfred de Musset said of the former, \"you could not open its door for\r\nless than fifteen francs;\" in other words, the prices charged were very\r\nhigh; but they were the same for the representatives of the nations that\r\nconquered as for those who were vanquished at Waterloo. It would be more\r\ncorrect to say that the _personnel_ of the Café, from the proprietor and\r\nmanager downward, were utterly oblivious of such distinctions of\r\nnationality. Every one who honoured the establishment was considered by\r\nthem a grand seigneur, for whom nothing could be too good. I remember\r\none day in '45 or '46--for M. Martin Guépet was at the head of affairs\r\nthen--Balzac announcing the advent of a Russian friend, and asking\r\nGuépet to put his best foot forward. \"Assuredly, monsieur, we will do\r\nso,\" was the answer, \"because it is simply what we are in the habit of\r\ndoing every day.\" The retort was sharp, but absolutely justified by\r\nfacts. One was never told at the Café de Paris that this or that dish\r\n\"could not be recommended,\" that \"the fish could not be guaranteed.\"\r\nWhen the quality of the latter was doubtful, it did not make its\r\nappearance on the bill of fare. _À propos_ of fish, there was a story\r\ncurrent in the Café de Paris which may or may not have been the\r\ninvention of one of the many clever literary men who foregathered there.\r\nIt was to the effect that one of Guépet's predecessors--Angilbert the\r\nyounger, I believe--had cast a doubt upon the historical accuracy of the\r\nfacts connected with the tragic death of Vatel, the renowned chef of the\r\nPrince de Condé. According to Angilbert, Vatel did not throw himself\r\nupon his sword because the fish for Louis XIV.'s dinner had not arrived,\r\nbut because it had arrived, been cooked, and was found \"not to be so\r\nfresh as it might be.\" The elimination of those dishes would have\r\ndisturbed the whole of the economy of the _menu_, and rather than suffer\r\nsuch disgrace Vatel made an end of himself. \"For you see, monsieur,\"\r\nAngilbert is supposed to have said, \"one can very well arrange a perfect\r\ndinner without fish, as long as one knows beforehand; but one cannot\r\nmodify a _service_ that has been thought out with it, when it fails at a\r\nmoment's notice. As every one of my chefs is a treasure, who would not\r\nscruple to imitate the sacrifice of his famous prototype; and as I do\r\nnot wish to expose him to such a heroic but inconvenient death, we take\r\nthe certain for the uncertain, consequently doubtful fish means no\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\nTruth or fiction, the story accurately conveys the pride of the\r\nproprietors in the unsullied gastronomic traditions of the\r\nestablishment, and there is no doubt that they were ably seconded in\r\nthat respect by every one around them, even to the _clientèle_ itself.\r\nNot a single one of the latter would have called the waiters by their\r\nnames, nor would these have ventured to rehearse the names of the dishes\r\nin a kind of slang or mutilated French, which is becoming more frequent\r\nday by day, and which is at best but fit as a means of communication\r\nbetween waiters and scullions. Least of all, would they have numbered\r\nthe clients, as is done at present. A gentleman sitting at table No. 5\r\nwas \"the gentleman at table No. 5,\" not merely \"number five.\" There was\r\nlittle need for the bellowing and shouting from one end of the room to\r\nthe other, because the head waiter himself had an eye everywhere. The\r\nword \"addition,\" which people think it good taste in the seventies and\r\neighties to employ when asking for their bills, was never heard. People\r\ndid not profess to know the nature of the arithmetical operation by\r\nwhich the total of their liabilities was arrived at; they left that to\r\nthe cashier and the rest of the underlings.\r\n\r\nNo coal or gas was used in the Café de Paris: lamps and wood fires\r\nupstairs; charcoal, and only that of a peculiar kind, in the kitchens,\r\nwhich might have been a hundred miles distant, for all we knew, for\r\nneither the rattling of dishes nor the smell of preparation betrayed\r\ntheir vicinity. A charming, subdued hum of voices attested the presence\r\nof two or three score of human beings attending to the inner man; the\r\nidiotic giggle, the affected little shrieks of the shopgirl or housemaid\r\npromoted to be the companion of the quasi-man of the world was never\r\nheard there. The _cabinet particulier_ was not made a feature of the\r\nCafé de Paris, and suppers were out of the question. Now and then the\r\nfrank laughter of the younger members of a family party, and that was\r\nall. As a rule, however, there were few strangers at the Café de Paris,\r\nor what are called chance customers, as distinct from periodical ones.\r\nBut there were half a score of tables absolutely sacred from the\r\ninvasion of no matter whom, such as those of the Marquis du Hallays,\r\nLord Seymour, the Marquis de St. Cricq, M. Romieu, Prince Rostopchine,\r\nPrince Soltikoff, Dr. Véron, etc., etc. Lord Palmerston, when in Paris,\r\nscarcely ever dined anywhere else than at the Café de Paris--of course I\r\nmean when dining at a public establishment.\r\n\r\nAlmost every evening there was an interchange of dishes or of wines\r\nbetween those tables; for instance, Dr. Véron, of whom I will have a\r\ngood deal to say in these notes, and who was very fond of Musigny\r\nvintage, rarely missed offering some to the Marquis du Hallays, who, in\r\nhis turn, sent him of the finest dishes from his table. For all these\r\nmen not only professed to eat well, but never to suffer from\r\nindigestion. Their gastronomy was really an art, but an art aided by\r\nscience which was applied to the simplest dish. One of these was _veau à\r\nla casserole_, which figured at least three times a week on the bill of\r\nfare, and the like of which I have never tasted elsewhere. Its\r\nrecuperative qualities were vouched for by such men as Alfred de Musset,\r\nBalzac, and Alexandre Dumas. The former partook of it whenever it was on\r\nthe bill; the others often came, after a spell of hard work, to recruit\r\ntheir mental and bodily strength with it, and maintained that nothing\r\nset them up so effectually.\r\n\r\nThese three men were particularly interesting to me, and their names\r\nwill frequently recur in these notes. I was very young, and, though\r\nperhaps not so enthusiastic about literature as I was about painting and\r\nsculpture, it would indeed have been surprising if I had remained\r\nindifferent to the fascination experienced by almost every one in their\r\nsociety: for let me state at once that the great poet, the great\r\nplaywright, and the great novelist were even something more than men of\r\ngenius; they were men of the world, and gentlemen who thought it worth\r\ntheir while to be agreeable companions. Unlike Victor Hugo, Lamartine,\r\nChateaubriand, and Eugène Sue, all of whom I knew about the same time,\r\nthey did not deem it necessary to stand mentally aloof from ordinary\r\nmortals. Alfred de Musset and Alexandre Dumas were both very handsome,\r\nbut each in a different way. With his tall, slim figure, auburn wavy\r\nhair and beard, blue eyes, and finely-shaped mouth and nose, De Musset\r\ngave one the impression of a dandy cavalry officer in mufti, rather than\r\nof a poet: the \"Miss Byron\" which Préault the sculptor applied to him\r\nwas, perhaps, not altogether undeserved, if judged intellectually and\r\nphysically at first sight. There was a feminine grace about all his\r\nmovements. The \"Confessions d'un Enfant du Siècle,\" his play, \"Frédéric\r\nand Bernerette,\" were apt to stir the heart of women rather than that of\r\nmen; but was it not perhaps because the majority of the strong sex\r\ncannot be stirred except with a pole? And the poet who was so sensitive\r\nto everything rough as to leave invariably the coppers given to him in\r\nexchange, was unlikely to take voluntarily to such an unwieldy and\r\nclumsy instrument to produce his effects.[4]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 4: This reluctance to handle coppers proved a sore\r\n         grief to his more economical and less fastidious brother Paul,\r\n         who watched like a guardian angel over his junior, whom he\r\n         worshipped. It is on record that he only said a harsh word to\r\n         him once in his life, namely, when they wanted to make him,\r\n         Paul, a member of the Académie Française. \"C'est bien assez\r\n         d'un immortel dans la famille,\" he replied to those who\r\n         counselled him to stand. Then, turning to his brother, \"Je ne\r\n         comprends pas pourquoi tu t'es fourré dans cette galère, si\r\n         elle est assez grande pour moi, tu dois y être joliment à\r\n         l'étroit.\" It is difficult to imagine a greater instance of\r\n         brotherly pride and admiration, because Paul de Musset was by\r\n         no means a nonentity, only from a very early age he had always\r\n         merged his individuality in that of Alfred. To some one who\r\n         once remarked upon this in my hearing, he answered, \"Que\r\n         voulez-vous? c'est comme cela: Alfred a eu toujours la moitié\r\n         du lit, seulement la moitié était toujours prise du milieu.\"]\r\n\r\nThroughout these notes, I intend to abstain carefully from literary\r\njudgments. I am not competent to enter into them; but, if I were, I\r\nshould still be reluctant to do so in the case of Alfred de Musset, who,\r\nto my knowledge, never questioned the talent of any one. De Musset\r\nimproved upon better acquaintance. He was apt to strike one at first as\r\ndistant and supercilious. He was neither the one nor the other, simply\r\nvery reserved, and at the best of times very sad, not to say melancholy.\r\nIt was not affectation, as has been said so often; it was his nature.\r\nThe charge of superciliousness arose from his distressing\r\nshort-sightedness, which compelled him to stare very hard at people\r\nwithout the least intention of being offensive.\r\n\r\nI have said that Balzac often came, after a spell of hard work, to\r\nrecruit his forces with the _veau à la casserole_ of the Café de Paris;\r\nI should have added that this was generally in the autumn and winter,\r\nfor, at the end of the spring and during the summer, the dinner hour,\r\nseven, found Balzac still a prisoner at home. Few of his acquaintances\r\nand friends ever caught sight of him, they were often in total ignorance\r\nof his whereabouts, and such news as reached them generally came through\r\nJoseph Méry, the poet and novelist, the only one who came across him\r\nduring those periods of eclipse. Méry was an inveterate gambler, and\r\nspent night after night at the card-table. He rarely left it before\r\ndaybreak. His way lay past the Café de Paris, and for four consecutive\r\nmornings he had met Balzac strolling leisurely up and down, dressed in a\r\npantalon à pieds (trousers not terminating below the ankle, but with\r\nfeet in them like stockings), and frock coat with velvet facings. The\r\nsecond morning, Méry felt surprised at the coincidence; the third, he\r\nwas puzzled; the fourth, he could hold out no longer, and asked Balzac\r\nthe reason of these nocturnal perambulations round about the same spot.\r\nBalzac put his hand in his pocket and produced an almanack, showing that\r\nthe sun did not rise before 3.40. \"I am being tracked by the officers\r\nof the Tribunal de Commerce, and obliged to hide myself during the day;\r\nbut at this hour I am free, and can take a walk, for as long as the sun\r\nis not up they cannot arrest me.\"\r\n\r\nI remember having read that Ouvrard, the great army contractor, had done\r\nthe same for many years; nevertheless, he was arrested one day,--the\r\nauthorities proved that the almanack was wrong, that the sun rose ten\r\nminutes earlier than was stated therein. He brought an action against\r\nthe compiler and publishers. They had to pay him damages.\r\n\r\nThough literary remuneration was not in those days what it became later\r\non, it was sufficiently large to make it difficult to explain the\r\nchronic impecuniosity of Balzac, though not that of Dumas. They were not\r\ngamblers, and had not the terrible fits of idleness or drinking which\r\nleft De Musset stranded every now and again. Lamartine suffered from the\r\nsame complaint, I mean impecuniosity. There is proof of Balzac's\r\nindustry and frugality in two extracts from his letters to his mother,\r\ndated Angoulême, July, 1832, when he himself was thirty-two years old,\r\nand had already written half a dozen masterpieces. \"Several bills are\r\ndue, and, if I cannot find the money for them, I will have them\r\nprotested and let the law take its course. It will give me breathing\r\ntime, and I can settle costs and all afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he works eight hours a day at \"Louis Lambert,\" one of the best\r\nthings among his numberless best things. His mother sends him a hundred\r\nfrancs, and, perhaps with the same pen with which he wrote those two\r\nmarvellous chapters that stand out like a couple of priceless rubies\r\nfrom among the mass of other jewels, he thanks her and accounts for\r\nthem. \"For the copying of the maps, 20 frs.; for my passport, 10 frs. I\r\nowed 15 frs. for discount on one of my bills, and 15 frs. on my fare. 15\r\nfrs. for flowers as a birthday present. Lost at cards, 10 frs. Postage\r\nand servant's tips, 15 frs. Total, 100 frs.\"\r\n\r\nBut these ten francs have not been lost at one fell swoop; they\r\nrepresent his bad luck at the _gaming table_ during the whole month of\r\nhis stay at Angoulême, at the house of his friend and sister's\r\nschoolfellow, Madame Zulma Carraud,--hence, something like seven sous\r\n(3-1/2_d._) per day: for which extravagance he makes up, on his return\r\nto Paris, by plunging into work harder than ever. He goes to roost at 7\r\np.m., \"like the fowls;\" and he is called at 1 a.m., when he writes\r\nuntil 8 a.m. He takes another hour and a half of sleep, and, after\r\npartaking of a light meal, \"gets into his collar\" until four in the\r\nafternoon. After that, he receives a few friends, takes a bath, or goes\r\nout, and immediately he has swallowed his dinner he \"turns in,\" as\r\nstated above. \"I shall be compelled to lead this nigger's life for a few\r\nmonths without stopping, in order not to be swamped by those terrible\r\nbills that are due.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts are not personal recollections. I have inserted them to\r\nmake good my statement that Balzac was neither a gambler, a drunkard,\r\nnor an idler.\r\n\r\n\"How does he spend his money?\" I asked Méry, when he had told us of his\r\nfourth meeting with Balzac on that very morning.\r\n\r\n\"In sops to his imagination, in balloons to the land of dreams, which\r\nballoons he constructs with his hard-won earnings and inflates with the\r\nessence of his visions, but which nevertheless will not rise three feet\r\nfrom the earth,\" he answered. Then he went on explaining: \"Balzac is\r\nfirmly convinced that every one of his characters has had, or has still,\r\nits counterpart in real life, notably the characters that have risen\r\nfrom humble beginnings to great wealth; and he thinks that, having\r\nworked out the secret of their success on paper, he can put it in\r\npractice. He embarks on the most harum-scarum speculations without the\r\nslightest practical knowledge; as, for instance, when he drew the plans\r\nfor his country-house at the Jardies (Ville d'Avray), and insisted upon\r\nthe builder carrying them out in every respect while he was away. When\r\nthe place was finished there was not a single staircase. Of course, they\r\nhad to put them outside, and he maintained that it was part of his\r\noriginal plan; but he had never given a thought to the means of ascent.\r\nBut here is Monsieur Louis Lurine. If you would like an idea of Balzac's\r\nimpracticability, let him tell you what occurred between Balzac and\r\nKugelmann a few months ago.\"\r\n\r\nKugelmann was at that time publishing a very beautifully illustrated\r\nwork, entitled \"Les Rues de Paris,\" which Louis Lurine was editing. We\r\nwere standing outside the Café Riche, and I knew Lurine by sight. Méry\r\nintroduced me to him. After a few preliminary remarks, Lurine told us\r\nthe following story. Of course, many years have elapsed since, but I\r\nthink I can trust to my memory in this instance.\r\n\r\n\"I had suggested,\" said Lurine, \"that Balzac should do the Rue de\r\nRichelieu, and we sent for him. I did not want more than half a sheet,\r\nso imagine my surprise when Balzac named his conditions, viz., five\r\nthousand francs, something over six hundred francs a page of about six\r\nhundred words. Kugelmann began to yell; I simply smiled; seeing which,\r\nBalzac said, as soberly as possible, 'You'll admit that, in order to\r\ndepict a landscape faithfully, one should study its every detail. Well,\r\nhow would you have me describe the Rue de Richelieu, convey an idea of\r\nits commercial aspect, unless I visit, one after the other, the various\r\nestablishments it contains? Suppose I begin by the Boulevard des\r\nItaliens: I'd be bound to take my déjeûner at the Café Cardinal, I would\r\nhave to buy a couple of scores at Brandus', a gun at the gunsmith's next\r\ndoor, a breastpin at the next shop. Could I do less than order a coat at\r\nthe tailor's, a pair of boots at the bootmaker's?'\r\n\r\n\"I cut him short. 'Don't go any further,' I said, 'or else we'll have\r\nyou in at \"Compagnie des Indes,\" and, as both lace and Indian shawls\r\nhave gone up in price, we'll be bankrupt before we know where we are.'\r\n\r\n\"Consequently,\" concluded Lurine, \"the thing fell through, and we gave\r\nthe commission to Guénot-Lacointe, who has done the thing very well and\r\nhas written twice the pages Balzac was asked for, without buying as much\r\nas a pair of gloves.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Balzac was not being harassed by the officials of the Tribunal de\r\nCommerce, he had to dodge the authorities of the National Guards, who\r\ngenerally had a warrant against him for neglect of duty. Unlike his\r\ngreat contemporary Dumas, Balzac had an invincible repugnance to play\r\nthe amateur warrior--a repugnance, by-the-way, to which we owe one of\r\nthe most masterly portraits of his wonderful gallery, that of the\r\nself-satisfied, bumptious, detestable bourgeoise, who struts about in\r\nhis uniform; I am alluding to Crével of \"La Cousine Bette.\" But civil\r\ndiscipline could take no cognizance of the novelist's likes and\r\ndislikes, and, after repeated \"notices\" and \"warnings,\" left at his\r\nregistered domicile, his incarceration was generally decided upon. As a\r\nrule, this happened about half a dozen times in a twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to catch the refractory national guard, which was not\r\neasy, seeing that, in order to avoid an enforced sojourn at the Hôtel\r\ndes Haricots,[5] Balzac not only disappeared from his usual haunts, but\r\nleft his regular domicile, and took an apartment elsewhere under an\r\nassumed name. On one occasion, at a small lodgings which he had taken\r\nnear his publisher, Hippolyte Souverain, under the name of Madame\r\nDupont, Léon Gozlan, having found him out, sent him a letter addressed\r\nto \"Madame Dupont, _née_ Balzac.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 5: The name of the military prison which was\r\n         originally built on the site of the former Collége Montaigu,\r\n         where the scholars were almost exclusively fed on haricot\r\n         beans. Throughout its removals the prison preserved its\r\n         nickname.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe sergeant-major of Balzac's company had undoubtedly a grudge against\r\nhim. He happened to be a perfumer, and ever since the publication and\r\nsuccess of \"César Birotteau\" the Paris perfumers bore Balzac no\r\ngoodwill. That particular one had sworn by all his essences and bottles\r\nthat he would lay hands on the recalcitrant private of his company in\r\nthe streets, for only under such conditions could he arrest him. To\r\nwatch at Balzac's ordinary domicile was of no use, and, when he had\r\ndiscovered his temporary residence, he had to lure him out of it,\r\nbecause the other was on his guard.\r\n\r\nOne morning, while the novelist was hard at work, his old housekeeper,\r\nwhom he always took with him, came to tell him that there was a large\r\nvan downstairs with a case addressed to him. \"How did they find me out\r\nhere?\" exclaimed Balzac, and despatched the dame to gather further\r\nparticulars. In a few moments she returned. The case contained an\r\nEtruscan vase sent from Italy, but, seeing that it had been knocking\r\nabout for the last three days in every quarter of Paris in the carman's\r\nefforts to find out the consignee, the former was anxious that M. Balzac\r\nshould verify the intact condition of the package before it was\r\nunloaded. Balzac fell straight into the trap. Giving himself no time\r\neven to exchange his dressing-gown, or rather his monk's frock he was in\r\nthe habit of wearing, for a coat, or his slippers for a pair of boots,\r\nhe rushed downstairs, watching with a benign smile the carrier handling\r\nmost delicately the treasure that had come to him.\r\n\r\n\"Caught at last,\" said a stentorian voice behind him, and dispelling the\r\ndream as its owner laid his hand on the novelist's shoulder, while a\r\ngigantic companion planted himself in front of the street door and cut\r\noff all retreat that way.\r\n\r\n\"With a refinement of cruelty, which in the eyes of posterity will\r\nconsiderably diminish the glory of his victory\"--I am quoting Balzac's\r\nown words as he related the scene to us at the Hôtel des Haricots--the\r\nsergeant-major perfumer would not allow his prisoner to change his\r\nclothes, and while the van with the precious Etruscan vase disappeared\r\nin the distance, Balzac was hustled into a cab to spend a week in\r\ndurance vile, where on that occasion he had the company of Adolphe Adam,\r\nthe composer of \"Le Postillon de Lonjumeau.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, \"les jours de fête étaient passés,\" and had been for the last\r\nfive years, ever since the Hôtel des Haricots had been transferred\r\nfrom the town mansion of the De Bazancourts in the Rue des\r\nFossés-Saint-Germain to its then locale near the Orléans railway\r\nstation. There were no more banquets in the refectory as there had\r\nbeen of yore. Each prisoner had his meals in his cell. Joseph Méry,\r\nNestor Roqueplan, and I were admitted as the clock struck two, and had\r\nto leave exactly an hour afterwards. It was during this visit that\r\nBalzac enacted the scene for us which I have endeavoured to describe\r\nabove, and reminded Méry of the last dinner he had given to Dumas,\r\nJules Sandeau, and several others in the former prison, which dinner\r\ncost five hundred francs. Eugène Sue, who was as unwilling as Balzac\r\nto perform his civic duties, had had three of his own servants to wait\r\nupon him there, and some of his plate and silver brought to his cell.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the name of the celebrated author of \"Les Mystères de Paris\"\r\nhas presented itself in the course of these notes, I may just as well\r\nhave done with him, for he forms part of the least agreeable of my\r\nrecollections. He was also an _habitué_ of the Café de Paris. A great\r\ndeal has been written about him; what has never been sufficiently\r\ninsisted upon was the _inveterate snobbishness of the man_. When I first\r\nknew him, about '42-'43, he was already in the zenith of his glory, but\r\nI had often heard others mention his name before then, and never very\r\nfavourably. His dandyism was offensive, mainly because it did not sit\r\nnaturally upon him. It did not spring from an innate refinement, but\r\nfrom a love of show, although his father, who had been known to some of\r\nthe son's familiars, was a worthy man, a doctor, and, it appears, a very\r\ngood doctor, but somewhat brusque, like our own Abernethy; still much\r\nmore of a gentleman at heart than the son. He did not like Eugène's\r\nextravagance, and when the latter, about '24, launched out into a\r\ncabriolet, he shipped him off on one of the king's vessels, as a\r\nsurgeon; to which fact French literature owed the first novels of the\r\nfuture author of \"Les Mystères de Paris\" and \"Le Juif-Errant.\"\r\n\r\nBut the father was gathered to his fathers, and Eugène, who had never\r\ntaken kindly to a seafaring life, returned to Paris, to spend his\r\ninheritance and to resume his old habits, which made one of his\r\nacquaintances say that \"le père and le fils had _both_ entered upon a\r\nbetter life.\" It appears that, though somewhat of a _poseur_ from the\r\nvery beginning, he was witty and amusing, and readily found access to\r\nthe circle that frequented the gardens of the Tivoli and the Café de\r\nParis.[6] They, in their turn, made him a member of the Jockey Club when\r\nit was founded, which kindness they unanimously regretted, as will be\r\nseen directly.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 6: There were two Tivoli gardens, both in the same\r\n         neighbourhood, the site of the present Quartier de l'Europe.\r\n         The author is alluding to the second, so often mentioned in the\r\n         novels of Paul de Kock.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe Tivoli gardens, though utterly forgotten at present, was in reality\r\nthe birthplace of the French Jockey Club. About the year 1833 a man\r\nnamed Bryon, one of whose descendants keeps, at the hour I write, a\r\nlarge livery stables near the Grand Café, opened a pigeon-shooting\r\ngallery in the Tivoli; the pigeons, from what I have heard, mainly\r\nconsisting of quails, larks, and other birds. The pigeons shot at were\r\nwooden ones, poised up high in the air, but motionless, as we still see\r\nthem at the suburban fairs around Paris. Seven years before, Bryon had\r\nstarted a \"society of amateurs of races,\" to whom, for a certain\r\nconsideration, he let a movable stand at private meetings, for there\r\nwere no others until the Society for the Encouragement of breeding\r\nFrench Horses started operations in 1834. But the deliberations at first\r\ntook place at Bryon's place in the Tivoli gardens, and continued there\r\nuntil, one day, Bryon asked the fourteen or fifteen members why they\r\nshould not have a locale of their own; the result was that they took\r\nmodest quarters in the Rue du Helder, or rather amalgamated with a small\r\nclub located there under the name of Le Bouge (The Den); for Lord\r\nSeymour, the Duke de Nemours, Prince Demidoff, and the rest were\r\nsufficiently clear-sighted to perceive that a Jockey Club governed on\r\nthe English principle was entirely out of the question. That was the\r\norigin of the French Jockey Club, which, after various migrations, is,\r\nat the time of writing, magnificently housed in one of the palatial\r\nmansions of the Rue Scribe. As a matter of course, some of the\r\nfashionable _habitués_ of the Café de Paris, though not knowing a\r\nfetlock from a pastern, were but too pleased to join an institution\r\nwhich, with the mania for everything English in full swing, then\r\nconferred as it were upon its members a kind of patent of \"good form,\"\r\nand, above all, of exclusiveness, for which some, even amidst the\r\nfleshpots of the celebrated restaurant, longed. Because, it must be\r\nremembered, though the majority of the company at the Café de Paris were\r\nvery well from the point of view of birth and social position, there was\r\nno possibility of excluding those who could lay no claim to such\r\ndistinctions, provided they had the money to pay their reckoning, and\r\nmost of them had more than enough for that. It appears that Eugène Sue\r\nwas not so objectionable as he became afterwards, when the wonderful\r\nsuccess of his \"Mystères de Paris\" and the \"Juif-Errant\" had turned his\r\nhead; he was made an original member of the club. Election on the\r\nnomination by three sponsors was not necessary then. That article was\r\nnot inserted in the rules until two years after the foundation of the\r\nParis Jockey Club.\r\n\r\nOf the success attending Sue's two best-known works, I can speak from\r\npersonal experience; for I was old enough to be impressed by it, and\r\nfoolish enough to rank him, on account of it, with Balzac and Dumas,\r\nperhaps a little higher than the former. After the lapse of many years,\r\nI can only console myself for my infatuation with the thought that\r\nthousands, of far greater intellectual attainments than mine, were in\r\nthe same boat, for it must not be supposed that the _furore_ created by\r\n\"Les Mystères de Paris\" was confined to one class, and that class the\r\nworst educated one. While it appeared in serial form in the _Débats_,\r\none had to bespeak the paper several hours beforehand, because, unless\r\none subscribed to it, it was impossible to get it from the news-vendors.\r\nAs for the reading-rooms where it was supposed to be kept, the\r\nproprietors frankly laughed in your face if you happened to ask for it,\r\nafter you had paid your two sous admission. \"Monsieur is joking. We have\r\ngot five copies, and we let them out at ten sous each for half an hour:\r\nthat's the time it takes to read M. Sue's story. We have one copy here,\r\nand if monsieur likes to take his turn he may do so, though he will\r\nprobably have to wait for three or four hours.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the guileless demoiselle behind the counter found even a more\r\neffective way of fleecing her clients. The cabinets de lecture altered\r\ntheir fees, and the two sous, which until then had conferred the right\r\nof staying as long as one liked, were transformed into the price of\r\nadmission for one hour. Each reader received a ticket on entering,\r\nstating the time, and the shrewd caissière made the round every ten\r\nminutes. I may say without exaggeration that the days on which the\r\ninstalment of fiction was \"crowded out,\" there was a general air of\r\nlistlessness about Paris. And, after the first few weeks, this happened\r\nfrequently; for by that time the Bertins had become quite as clever as\r\ntheir formidable rival, the proprietor and editor of the\r\n_Constitutionnel_, the famous Dr. Véron, whom I have already mentioned,\r\nbut of whom I shall have occasion to speak again and again, for he was\r\none of the most notable characters in the Paris of my early manhood. But\r\nto return for a moment to \"Les Mystères de Paris\" and its author.\r\n\r\nThe serial, then, was frequently interrupted for one or two days,\r\nwithout notice, however, to the readers; on its resumption there was a\r\nnice little paragraph to assure the \"grandes dames de par le monde,\" as\r\nwell as their maids, with regard to the health of M. Sue, who was\r\nsupposed to have been too ill to work. The public took all this _au\r\ngrand sérieux_. They either chose to forget, or were ignorant of the\r\nfact, that a novel of that kind, especially in the early days of serial\r\nfeuilleton, was not delivered to the editor bit by bit. Sue, great man\r\nas he was, would not have dared to inaugurate the system only adopted\r\nsomewhat later by Alexandre Dumas the Elder, namely, that of writing\r\n\"from hand to mouth.\" These paragraphs served a dual purpose--they\r\nwhetted the lady and other readers' interest in the author, and informed\r\nthe indifferent ones how great that interest was. For these paragraphs\r\nwere, or professed to be,--I really believe they were,--the courteous\r\nreplies to hundreds of kind inquiries which the author \"could not\r\nacknowledge separately for lack of time.\"\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. There was really a good excuse for Eugène Sue \"se\r\nprenant au sérieux,\" seeing that some of the most eminent magistrates\r\nlooked upon him in that light and opened a correspondence with him,\r\nsubmitting their ideas about reforming such criminals as \"le maître\r\nd'école,\" and praising Prince Rodolph, or rather Eugène Sue under that\r\nname, for \"his laudable efforts in the cause of humanity.\" In reality,\r\nSue was in the position of Molière's \"bourgeois gentilhomme\" who spoke\r\nprose without being aware of it; for there was not the smallest evidence\r\nfrom his former work that he intended to inaugurate any crusade, either\r\nsocialistic or philanthropic, when he began his \"Mystères de Paris.\" He\r\nsimply wanted to write a stirring novel. But, unlike M. Jourdain, he did\r\nnot plead ignorance of his own good motives when congratulated upon\r\nthem. On the contrary, he gravely and officially replied in the _Débats_\r\nwithout winking. Some of the papers, not to be outdone, gravely\r\nrecounted how whole families had been converted from their evil ways by\r\nthe perusal of the novel; how others, after supper, had dropped on their\r\nknees to pray for their author; how one working man had exclaimed, \"You\r\nmay say what you like, it would be a good thing if Providence sent many\r\nmen like M. Sue in this world to take up the cudgels of the honest and\r\nstruggling artisan.\" Thereupon Béranger, who did not like to be\r\nforgotten in this chorus of praise, paid a ceremonious visit to Sue, and\r\nbetween the two they assumed the protectorship of the horny-handed son\r\nof toil.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that I am joking or exaggerating, and that the\r\n_engoûment_ was confined to the lower classes, and to provincial and\r\nmetropolitan faddists. Such men as M. de Lourdoueix, the editor of the\r\n_Gazette de France_, fell into the trap. I have pointed out elsewhere\r\nthat the republicans and socialists of those days were not necessarily\r\ngodless folk, and M. de Lourdoueix fitly concluded that a socialistic\r\nwriter like Sue might become a powerful weapon in his hands against the\r\nJesuits. So he went to the novelist, and gave him a commission to that\r\neffect. The latter accepted, and conceived the plot of \"The Wandering\r\nJew.\" When it was sketched out, he communicated it to the editor; but\r\nwhether that gentleman had reconsidered the matter in the interval, or\r\nwhether he felt frightened at the horribly tragic conception with\r\nscarcely any relief, he refused the novel, unless it was modified to a\r\ngreat extent and its blood-curdling episodes softened. The author,\r\ntaking himself _au sérieux_ this time as a religious reformer, declined\r\nto alter a line. Dr. Véron got wind of the affair, bought the novel as\r\nit stood, and, by dint of a system of puffing and advertising which\r\nwould even make a modern American stare, obtained a success with it in\r\nthe _Constitutionnel_ which equalled if it did not surpass that of the\r\n_Débats_ with the \"Mystères.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very amusing indeed,\" said George Sand one night, \"but there are\r\ntoo many animals. I hope we shall soon get out of this ménagerie.\"\r\nNevertheless, she frankly admitted that she would not like to miss an\r\ninstalment for ever so much.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sue posed and posed, not as a writer--for, like Horace\r\nWalpole, he was almost ashamed of the title--but as \"a man of the world\"\r\nwho knew nothing about literature, but whose wish to benefit humanity\r\nhad been greater than his reluctance to enter the lists with such men as\r\nBalzac and Dumas. After his dinner at the Café de Paris, he would\r\ngravely stand on the steps smoking his cigar and listen to the\r\nconversation with an air of superiority without attempting to take part\r\nin it. His mind was supposed to be far away, devising schemes for the\r\nsocial and moral improvement of his fellow-creatures. These\r\nphilanthropic musings did not prevent him from paying a great deal of\r\nattention--too much perhaps--to his personal appearance, for even in\r\nthose days of beaux, bucks, and dandies, of Counts d'Orsay and others,\r\nmen could not help thinking Eugène Sue overdressed. He rarely appeared\r\nwithout spurs to his boots, and he would no more have done without a new\r\npair of white kid gloves every evening than without his dinner. Other\r\nmen, like Nestor de Roqueplan, Alfred de Musset, Major Fraser, all of\r\nwhose names will frequently recur in these notes, did not mind having\r\ntheir gloves cleaned, though the process was not so perfect as it is\r\nnow; Eugène Sue averred that the smell of cleaned gloves made him ill.\r\nAlfred de Musset, who could be very impertinent when he liked, but who\r\nwas withal a very good fellow, said one day: \"Mais enfin, mon ami, ça ne\r\nsent pas pire que les bouges que vous nous dépeignez. N'y seriez vous\r\njamais allé?\"\r\n\r\nIn short, several years before the period of which I now treat, Eugène\r\nSue had begun to be looked upon coldly at the Jockey Club on account of\r\nthe \"airs he gave himself;\" and three years before the startling success\r\nof his work, he had altogether ceased to go there, though he was still a\r\nmember, and remained so nominally until '47, when his name was removed\r\nfrom the list in accordance with Rule 5. Owing to momentary pecuniary\r\nembarrassments, he had failed to pay his subscription. It may safely be\r\nasserted that this was merely a pretext to get rid of him, because such\r\nstringent measures are rarely resorted to at any decent club, whether in\r\nLondon or Paris, and least of all at the Jockey Clubs there. The fact\r\nwas, that the members did not care for a fellow-member whose taste\r\ndiffered so materially from their own, whose daily avocations and\r\npursuits had nothing in common with theirs; for though Eugène Sue as\r\nearly as 1835 had possessed a race-horse, named Mameluke, which managed\r\nto come in a capital last at Maisons-sur-Seine (afterwards\r\nMaisons-Lafitte); though he had ridden his _haque_ every day in the\r\nBois, and driven his cabriolet every afternoon in the Champs-Élysées,\r\nthe merest observer could easily perceive that all this was done for\r\nmere show, to use the French expression, \"pose.\" As one of the members\r\nobserved, \"M. Sue est toujours trop habillé, trop carossé, et surtout\r\ntrop éperonné.\"\r\n\r\nM. Sue was all that, and though the Jockey Club at that time was by no\r\nmeans the unobtrusive body of men it is to-day, its excesses and\r\neccentricities were rarely indulged in public, except perhaps in\r\ncarnival time. A M. de Chateau-Villard might take it into his head to\r\nplay a game of billiards on horseback, or M. de Machado might live\r\nsurrounded by a couple of hundred parrots if he liked; none of these\r\nfancies attracted the public's notice: M. Sue, by his very profession,\r\nattracted too much of it, and brought a great deal of it into the club\r\nitself; hence, when he raised a violent protest against his expulsion\r\nand endeavoured to neutralize it by sending in his resignation, the\r\ncommittee maintained its original decision. A few years after this,\r\nEugène Sue disappeared from the Paris horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     Alexandre Dumas père -- Why he made himself particularly\r\n     agreeable to Englishmen -- His way of silencing people -- The\r\n     pursuit he loved best next to literature -- He has the privilege\r\n     of going down to the kitchens of the Café de Paris -- No one\r\n     questions his literary genius, some question his culinary\r\n     capacities -- Dr. Véron and his cordon-bleu -- Dr. Véron's\r\n     reasons for dining out instead of at home -- Dr. Véron's friend,\r\n     the philanthropist, who does not go to the theatre because he\r\n     objects to be hurried with his emotions -- Dr. Véron, instigated\r\n     by his cook, accuses Dumas of having collaborateurs in preparing\r\n     his dishes as he was known to have collaborateurs in his literary\r\n     work -- Dumas' wrath -- He invites us to a dinner which shall be\r\n     wholly cooked by him in the presence of a delegate to be chosen\r\n     by the guests -- The lot falls upon me -- Dr. Véron and Sophie\r\n     make the _amende honorable_ -- A dinner-party at Véron's -- A\r\n     curious lawsuit in connection with Weber's \"Freyschutz\" -- Nestor\r\n     Roqueplan, who became the successor of the defendant in the case,\r\n     suggests a way out of it -- Léon Pillet virtually adopts it and\r\n     wins the day -- A similar plan adopted years before by a fireman\r\n     on duty at the opéra, on being tried by court-martial for having\r\n     fallen asleep during the performance of \"Guido et Génevra\" --\r\n     Firemen not bad judges of plays and operas -- They were often\r\n     consulted both by Meyerbeer and Dumas -- Dumas at work -- How he\r\n     idled his time away -- Dumas causes the traffic receipts of the\r\n     Chemin de Fer de l'Ouest to swell during his three years'\r\n     residence at Saint-Germain -- M. de Montalivet advises\r\n     Louis-Philippe to invite Dumas to Versailles, to see what his\r\n     presence will do for the royal city -- Louis-Philippe does not\r\n     act upon the advice -- The relations between Dumas and the\r\n     d'Orléans family -- After the Revolution of '48, Dumas becomes a\r\n     candidate for parliament -- The story of his canvass and his\r\n     address to the electors at Joigny -- Dumas' utter indifference to\r\n     money matters -- He casts his burdens upon others -- Dumas and\r\n     his creditors -- Writs and distraints -- How they are dealt with\r\n     -- Dumas' indiscriminate generosity -- A dozen houses full of new\r\n     furniture in half as many years -- Dumas' frugality at table --\r\n     Literary remuneration -- Dumas and his son -- \"Leave me a hundred\r\n     francs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong my most pleasant recollections of those days are those of\r\nAlexandre Dumas. To quote his own words, \"whenever he met an Englishman\r\nhe considered it his particular duty to make himself agreeable to him,\r\nas part of the debt he owed to Shakespeare and Walter Scott.\" I doubt\r\nwhether Dumas ever made himself deliberately disagreeable to any one;\r\neven when provoked, he managed to disarm his adversary with an epigram,\r\nrather than wound him. One evening, a professor at one of the provincial\r\nuniversities had been dining at the Café de Paris, as the guest of Roger\r\nde Beauvoir. He had a magnificent cameo breastpin. It elicited the\r\nadmiration of every one, and notably that of Dumas. He said at once that\r\nit was a portrait of Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n\"Are you an archæologist?\" asked the professor.\r\n\r\n\"I,\" replied Dumas, \"I am absolutely nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" insisted the visitor, \"you perceived at once that it was a\r\nportrait of Julius Cæsar.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not very wonderful. Cæsar is essentially a Roman type; and,\r\nbesides, I know Cæsar as well as most people, and perhaps better.\"\r\n\r\nTo tell a professor of history--especially a provincial one--that one\r\nknows Cæsar as well as most people and perhaps better, is naturally to\r\nprovoke the question, \"In what capacity?\" As a matter of course the\r\nquestion followed immediately.\r\n\r\n\"In the capacity of Cæsar's historian,\" said Dumas imperturbably.\r\n\r\nWe were getting interested, because we foresaw that the professor would,\r\nin a few minutes, get the worst of it. Dumas' eyes were twinkling with\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\n\"You have written a history of Cæsar?\" asked the learned man.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you won't mind my being frank with you: it is because it has\r\nnever been mentioned in the world of savans.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world of savans never mentions me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, a history of Cæsar ought to make somewhat of a sensation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine has not made any. People read it, and that was all. It is the\r\nbooks which it is impossible to read that make a sensation: they are\r\nlike the dinners one cannot digest; the dinners one digests are not as\r\nmuch as thought of next morning.\" That was Dumas' way of putting a\r\nwould-be impertinent opponent _hors de combat_, and his repartees were\r\nfrequently drawn from the pursuit he loved as well, if not better than\r\nliterature, namely, cooking. It may sound exaggerated, but I verily\r\nbelieve that Dumas took a greater pride in concocting a stew than in\r\nconstructing a novel or a play. Very often, in the middle of the dinner,\r\nhe would put down his knife and fork. \"Ça, c'est rudement bon: il faut\r\nque je m'en procure la recette.\" And Guépet was sent for to authorize\r\nDumas to descend to the lower regions and have a consultation with his\r\nchefs. He was the only one of the _habitués_ who had ever been in the\r\nkitchens of the Café de Paris. As a rule these excursions were followed\r\nby an invitation to dine at Dumas' two or three days hence, when the\r\nknowledge freshly acquired would be put into practice.\r\n\r\nThere were few of us who questioned Dumas' literary genius; there were\r\nmany who suspected his culinary abilities, and notably among them, Dr.\r\nVéron. The germs of this unbelief had been sown in the doctor's mind by\r\nhis own cordon-bleu, Sophie. The erstwhile director of the opera lived,\r\nat that time, in a beautiful apartment on the first floor of a nice\r\nhouse in the Rue Taitbout, at the corner of which the Café de Paris was\r\nsituated. Sophie had virtually a sinecure of it, because, with the\r\nexception of a dinner-party now and then, her master, who was a\r\nbachelor, took his dinners at the restaurant. And with regard to the\r\ndéjeûner, there was not much chance of her displaying her talents,\r\nbecause the man, who was reputed to be a very Apicius, was frugality\r\nitself. His reasons for dining out instead of at home were perfectly\r\nlogical, though they sounded paradoxical. One day, when I was remarking\r\nupon the seemingly strange habit of dining out, when he was paying \"a\r\nperfect treasure\" at home, he gave me these reasons. \"My dear friend,\r\ndepend upon it that it is man's stomach which found the aphorism, 'Qui\r\nva _piano_ va _sano_, qui va _sano_ va _lontano_.' In your own home the\r\nsoup is on the table at a certain hour, the roast is taken off the jack,\r\nthe dessert is spread out on the sideboard. Your servants, in order to\r\nget more time over their meals, hurry you up; they do not serve you,\r\nthey gorge you. At the restaurant, on the contrary, they are never in a\r\nhurry, they let you wait. And, besides, I always tell the waiters not to\r\nmind me; that I like being kept a long while--that is one of the reasons\r\nwhy I come here.\r\n\r\n\"Another thing, at the restaurant the door is opened at every moment and\r\nsomething happens. A friend, a chum, or a mere acquaintance comes in;\r\none chats and laughs: all this aids digestion. A man ought not to be\r\nlike a boa-constrictor, he ought not to make digestion a business apart.\r\nHe ought to dine and to digest at the same time, and nothing aids this\r\ndual function like good conversation. Perhaps the servant of Madame de\r\nMaintenon, when the latter was still Madame Scarron, was a greater\r\nphilosopher than we suspect when he whispered to his mistress, 'Madame,\r\nthe roast has run short; give them another story.'\r\n\r\n\"I knew a philanthropist,\" wound up Dr. Véron, \"who objected as much to\r\nbe hurried over his emotions as I object to be hurried over my meals.\r\nFor that reason he never went to the theatre. When he wanted an\r\nemotional fillip, he wandered about the streets until he met some poor\r\nwretch evidently hungry and out of elbows. He took him to the nearest\r\nwine-shop, gave him something to eat and to drink, sat himself opposite\r\nto his guest, and told him to recount his misfortunes. 'But take your\r\ntime over it. I am not in a hurry,' he recommended. The poor outcast\r\nbegan his tale; my friend listened attentively until he was thoroughly\r\nmoved. If the man's story was very sad, he gave him a franc or two; if\r\nit was positively heart-rending and made him cry, he gave him a\r\nfive-franc piece; after which, he came to see me, saying, 'I have\r\nthoroughly enjoyed myself, and made the intervals between each\r\nsensational episode last as long as I liked, and, what is more, it has\r\njust cost me seven francs, the price of a stall at the theatre.'\"\r\n\r\nTo return to Dr. Véron's scepticism with regard to Dumas' culinary\r\naccomplishments, and how he was converted. Dumas, it appears, had got\r\nthe recipe for stewing carp from a German lady, and, being at that\r\nmoment on very friendly terms with Dr. Véron, which was not always the\r\ncase, had invited him and several others to come and taste the results\r\nof his experiments. The dish was simply splendid, and for days and days\r\nVéron, who was really a frugal eater, could talk of nothing else to his\r\ncook.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you taste it?\" said Sophie, getting somewhat jealous of this\r\npraise of others; \"at the Café de Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, at Monsieur Dumas',\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I'll go to Monsieur Dumas' cook, and get the recipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's of no use,\" objected her master. \"Monsieur Dumas prepared the\r\ndish himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I'll go to Monsieur Dumas himself and ask him to give me\r\nthe recipe.\"\r\n\r\nSophie was as good as her word, and walked herself off to the Chaussée\r\nd'Antin. The great novelist felt flattered, and gave her every possible\r\ninformation, but somehow the dish was not like that her master had so\r\nmuch enjoyed at his friend's. Then Sophie grew morose, and began to\r\nthrow out hints about the great man's borrowing other people's feathers\r\nin his culinary pursuits, just as he did in his literary ones. For\r\nSophie was not altogether illiterate, and the papers at that time were\r\nfrequently charging Dumas with keeping his collaborateurs too much in\r\nthe background and himself too much in front. Dumas had never much\r\ndifficulty in meeting such accusations, but Sophie had unconsciously hit\r\nupon the tactics of the clever solicitor who recommended the barrister\r\nto abuse the plaintiff, the defendant's case being bad, and she put it\r\ninto practice. \"C'est avec sa carpe comme avec ses romans, les autres\r\nles font et il y met son nom,\" she said one day. \"Je l'ai bien vu, c'est\r\nun grand diable de vaniteux.\"\r\n\r\nNow, there was no doubt about it, to those who did not know him very\r\nwell, Dumas was \"un grand diable de vaniteux;\" and the worthy doctor sat\r\npondering his cook's remarks until he himself felt inclined to think\r\nthat Dumas had a clever chef in the background, upon whose victories he\r\nplumed himself. Meanwhile Dumas had been out of town for more than a\r\nmonth, but a day or so after his return he made his appearance at the\r\nCafé de Paris, and, as a matter of course, inquired after the result of\r\nSophie's efforts. The doctor was reticent at first, not caring to\r\nacknowledge Sophie's failure. He had, however, made the matter public,\r\nalleging, at the same time, Sophie's suspicions as to Dumas' hidden\r\ncollaborateur, and one of the company was ill advised enough to let the\r\ncat out of the bag. During the many years of my acquaintance with Dumas,\r\nI have never seen him in such a rage as then. But he toned down in a\r\nvery few minutes. \"Il n'y a qu'une réponse à une accusation pareille,\"\r\nhe said in a grandiloquent tone, which, however, had the most comical\r\neffect, seeing how trifling the matter was in reality--\"il n'y qu'une\r\nréponse; vous viendrez dîner avec moi demain, vous choissirez un délégué\r\nqui viendra à partir de trois heures me voir préparer mon dîner.\" I was\r\nthe youngest, the choice fell upon me. That is how my lifelong\r\nfriendship with Dumas began. At three o'clock next day I was at the\r\nChaussée d'Antin, and was taken by the servant into the kitchen, where\r\nthe great novelist stood surrounded by his utensils, some of silver, and\r\nall of them glistening like silver. With the exception of a soupe aux\r\nchoux, at which, by his own confession, he had been at work since the\r\nmorning, all the ingredients for the dinner were in their natural\r\nstate--of course, washed and peeled, but nothing more. He was assisted\r\nby his own cook and a kitchen-maid, but he himself, with his sleeves\r\nrolled up to the elbows, a large apron round his waist, and bare chest,\r\nconducted the operations. I do not think I have ever seen anything more\r\nentertaining, though in the course of these notes I shall have to\r\nmention frequent vagaries on the part of great men. I came to the\r\nconclusion that when writers insisted upon the culinary challenges of\r\nCarême, Dugléré, and Casimir they were not indulging in mere metaphor.\r\n\r\nAt half-past six the guests began to arrive; at a quarter to seven Dumas\r\nretired to his dressing-room; at seven punctually the servant announced\r\nthat \"monsieur était servi.\" The dinner consisted of the aforenamed\r\nsoupe aux choux, the carp that had led to the invitation, a ragoût de\r\nmouton à la Hongroise, rôti de faisans, and a salade Japonaise. The\r\nsweets and ices had been sent by the patissier. I never dined like that\r\nbefore or after, not even a week later, when Dr. Véron and Sophie made\r\nthe _amende honorable_ in the Rue Taitbout.\r\n\r\nI have spent many delightful evenings with all these men; I do not\r\nremember having spent a more delightful one than on the latter occasion.\r\nEvery one was in the best of humours; the dinner was very fine; albeit\r\nthat, course for course, it did not come up to Dumas'; and, moreover,\r\nduring the week that had elapsed between the two entertainments, one of\r\nDr. Véron's successors at the opera, Léon Pillet, had been served with\r\nthe most ludicrous citation that was ever entered on the rolls of any\r\ntribunal. For nearly nineteen years before that period there had been\r\nseveral attempts to mount Weber's \"Freyschutz,\" all of which had come to\r\nnought. There had been an adaptation by Castil-Blaze, under the title of\r\n\"Robin des Bois,\" and several others; but until '41, Weber's work, even\r\nin a mutilated state, was not known to the French opera-goer. At that\r\ntime, however, M. Émilien Paccini made a very good translation; Hector\r\nBerlioz was commissioned to write the recitatives, for it must be\r\nremembered that Weber's opera contains dialogue, and that dialogue is\r\nnot admissible in grand opera. Berlioz acquitted himself with a taste\r\nand reverence for the composer's original scheme that did great credit\r\nto both; he sought his themes in Weber's work itself, notably in the\r\n\"Invitation à la Valse;\" but notwithstanding all this, the \"Freyschutz\"\r\nwas miserably amputated in the performance lest it should \"play\" longer\r\nthan midnight, though a ballet was added rather than deprive the public\r\nof its so-called due. Neither Paccini nor Berlioz had set foot in the\r\nopera-house since their objections to such a course had been overruled,\r\nand they made it known to the world at large that no blame attached to\r\nthem; nevertheless, this quasi \"Freyschutz\" met with a certain amount of\r\nsuccess. M. Pillet was rubbing his hands with glee at his own\r\ncleverness, until a Nemesis came in the shape of a visitor from the\r\nFatherland, who took the conceit out of the director with one fell blow,\r\nand, what was worse still, with a perfectly legal one.\r\n\r\nThe visitor was no less a personage than Count Tyszkiewicz, one of the\r\nbest musical critics of the time and the editor of the foremost musical\r\npublication in the world; namely, _Die Musikalische Zeitung_, of\r\nLeipzig. The count, having been attracted by the announcement of the\r\nopera on the bills, was naturally anxious to hear how French artists\r\nwould acquit themselves of a work particularly German, and, having\r\nsecured a stall, anticipated an enjoyable evening. But alack and alas!\r\nin a very little while his indignation at the liberties taken with the\r\ntext and the score by the singers, musicians, and conductor got the\r\nupper hand, and he rushed off to the commissary of police on duty at the\r\ntheatre to claim the execution of Weber's opera in its integrity, as\r\npromised on the bills, or the restitution of his money. Failing to get\r\nsatisfaction either way, he required the commissary to draw up a\r\nverbatim report of his objections and his claim, determined to bring an\r\naction. Next morning, he sent a lithographed account of the transaction\r\nto all the papers, requesting its insertion, with which request not a\r\nsingle one complied. Finding himself baffled at every turn, he engaged\r\nlawyer and counsel and began proceedings.\r\n\r\nIt was at that stage of the affair that the dinner at Dr. Véron's took\r\nplace. As a matter of course, the coming lawsuit gave rise to a great\r\ndeal of chaff on the part of the guests, although the victim of this\r\nbadinage and defendant in the suit was not there. It was his successor\r\nwho took up the cudgels and predicted the plaintiff's discomfiture. \"The\r\ncounsel,\" said Roqueplan, \"ought to be instructed to invite the\r\npresident and assessors to come and hear the work before they deliver\r\njudgment: if they like it personally, they will not decide against\r\nPillet; if they don't, they'll fall asleep and be ashamed to own it\r\nafterwards. But should they give a verdict for the plaintiff, Pillet\r\nought to appeal on a question of incompetence; a person with the name\r\nof Tyszkiewicz has no right to plead in the interest of harmony.\"[7]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 7: The latter plea was, in fact, advanced by Pillet's\r\n         counsel in the first instance, on Roqueplan's advice, and\r\n         perhaps influenced the court; for though it gave a verdict for\r\n         the plaintiff, it was only for _seven francs_ (the price of the\r\n         stall), and costs. The verdict was based upon the\r\n         \"consideration\" that the defendant had not carried out\r\n         altogether the promise set forth on the programme.]\r\n\r\nAmong such a company as that gathered round Dr. Véron's table, a single\r\nsentence frequently led to a host of recollections. Scarcely had\r\nRoqueplan's suggestion to invite the president and assessors of the\r\ncourt to the performance of the \"Freyschutz\" been broached than our host\r\nchimed in: \"I can tell you a story where the expedient you recommend was\r\nreally resorted to, though it did not emanate from half as clever a man\r\nas you, Roqueplan. In fact, it was only a pompier that hit upon it to\r\nget out of a terrible scrape. He was going to be brought before a\r\ncourt-martial for neglect of duty. It happened under the management of\r\nmy immediate successor, Duponchel, at the fourth or fifth performance of\r\nHalévy's 'Guido et Génevra.' Some of the scenery caught fire, and, but\r\nfor Duponchel's presence of mind, there would have been a panic and a\r\nhorrible catastrophe. Nevertheless, the cause of the accident had to be\r\nascertained, and it was found that the brigadier fireman posted at the\r\nspot where the mischief began had been asleep. He frankly admitted his\r\nfault, at the same time pleading extenuating circumstances. 'What do you\r\nmean?' asked the captain, charged with the report. 'Such a thing has\r\nnever happened to me before, mon capitaine, but it is impossible for any\r\none to keep his eyes open during that act. You need not take my word,\r\nbut perhaps you will try the effect yourself.' The captain did try; the\r\ncaptain sat for two or three minutes after the rise of the curtain, then\r\nhe was seen to leave his place hurriedly. The brigadier and his men were\r\nseverely reprimanded, but they were not tried. Out of respect for Halévy\r\nthe matter was kept a secret.\r\n\r\n\"I may add,\" said our host, \"that the pompier is by no means a bad judge\r\nof things theatrical, seeing that he is rarely away from the stage for\r\nmore than three or four nights at a time. I remember perfectly well\r\nthat, during the rehearsals of 'Robert le Diable,' Meyerbeer often had a\r\nchat with them. Curiously enough he now and then made little alterations\r\nafter these conversations. I am not insinuating that the great composer\r\nacted upon their suggestions, but I should not at all wonder if he had\r\ndone so.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandre Dumas, in whose honour, it will be remembered, the dinner was\r\ngiven, had an excellent memory, and some years afterwards profited by\r\nthe experiment. I tell the story as it was given to us subsequently by\r\nhis son. Only a few friends and Alexandre the younger were present at\r\nthe first of the final rehearsals of \"The Three Musketeers,\" at the\r\nAmbigu Comique. They were not dress rehearsals proper, because there\r\nwere no costumes, and the scenery merely consisted of a cloth and some\r\nwings. Behind one of the latter they had noticed, during the first six\r\ntableaux, the shining helmet of a fireman who was listening very\r\nattentively. The author had noticed him too. About the middle of the\r\nseventh tableau the helmet suddenly vanished, and the father remarked\r\nupon it to his son. When the act was finished, Dumas went in search of\r\nthe pompier, who did not know him. \"What made you go away?\" he asked\r\nhim. \"Because it did not amuse me half as much as the others,\" was the\r\nanswer. \"That was enough for my father,\" said the younger Dumas. \"There\r\nand then he went to Béraud's room, took off his coat, waistcoat, and\r\nbraces, unfastened the collar of his shirt--it was the only way he could\r\nwork--and sent for the prompt copy of the seventh tableau, which he tore\r\nup and flung into the fire, to the consternation of Béraud. 'What are\r\nyou doing?' he exclaimed. 'You see what I am doing; I am destroying the\r\nseventh tableau. It does not amuse the pompier. I know what it wants.'\r\nAnd an hour and a half later, at the termination of the rehearsal, the\r\nactors were given a fresh seventh tableau to study.\"\r\n\r\nI have come back by a roundabout way to the author of \"Monte-Christo,\"\r\nbecause, tout chemin avec moi mène à Dumas; I repeat, he constitutes one\r\nof the happiest of my recollections. After the lapse of many years, I\r\nwillingly admit that I would have cheerfully foregone the acquaintance\r\nof all the other celebrities, perhaps David d'Angers excepted, for that\r\nof Dumas père.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of many years, the elder Dumas still represents to me\r\nall the good qualities of the French nation and few of their bad ones.\r\nIt was absolutely impossible to be dull in his society, but it must not\r\nbe thought that these contagious animal spirits only showed themselves\r\nperiodically or when in company. It was what the French have so aptly\r\ntermed \"la joie de vivre,\" albeit that they rarely associate the phrase\r\nwith any one not in the spring of life. With Dumas it was chronic until\r\na very few months before his death. I remember calling upon him shortly\r\nafter the dinner of which I spoke just now. He had taken up his quarters\r\nat Saint-Germain, and come to Paris only for a few days. \"Is monsieur at\r\nhome?\" I said to the servant.\r\n\r\n\"He is in his study, monsieur,\" was the answer. \"Monsieur can go in.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment I heard a loud burst of laughter from the inner\r\napartment, so I said, \"I would sooner wait until monsieur's visitors are\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur has no visitors; he is working,\" remarked the servant with a\r\nsmile. \"Monsieur Dumas often laughs like this at his work.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true enough, the novelist was alone, or rather in company with\r\none of his characters, at whose sallies he was simply roaring.\r\n\r\nWork, in fact, was a pleasure to him, like everything else he undertook.\r\nOne day he had been out shooting, between Villers-Cotterets and\r\nCompiègne, since six in the morning, and had killed twenty-nine birds.\r\n\"I am going to make up the score and a half, and then I'll have a sleep,\r\nfor I feel tired,\" he said. When he had killed his thirtieth partridge\r\nhe slowly walked back to the farm, where his son and friends found him\r\nabout four hours later, toasting himself before the fire, his feet on\r\nthe andirons, and twirling his thumbs.\r\n\r\n\"What are you sitting there for like that?\" asked his son.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you see? I am resting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you get your sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't; it's impossible to sleep here. There is an infernal\r\nnoise; what with the sheep, the cows, the pigs, and the rest, there is\r\nno chance of getting a wink.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you have been sitting here for the last four hours, twirling your\r\nthumbs?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have been writing a piece in one act.\" The piece in question was\r\n\"Romulus,\" which he gave to Régnier to have it read at the\r\nComédie-Française, under a pseudonym, and as the work of a young unknown\r\nauthor. It was accepted without a dissentient vote.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact, vouched for by the accounts of the Compagnie\r\ndu Chemin de Fer de l'Ouest, that during the three years Dumas lived at\r\nSaint-Germain, the receipts increased by twenty thousand francs per\r\nannum. Of course, it has been objected that railways being then in their\r\ninfancy the increment would have been just the same without Dumas'\r\npresence in the royal residence, but, curiously enough, from the day he\r\nleft, the passenger traffic fell to its previous state. Dumas had simply\r\ngalvanized the sleepy old town into life, he had bought the theatre\r\nwhere the artists of the Comédie-Française, previous to supping with\r\nhim, came to play \"Mademoiselle de Belle-Isle\" or the \"Demoiselles de\r\nSaint-Cyr,\" for the benefit of the poor. On such occasions, there was\r\nnot a room to be had at the hotels. After supper, there were twice a\r\nweek fireworks on the Terrace, which could be seen from Paris and from\r\nVersailles, to the great astonishment of Louis-Philippe, who really\r\nattributed the change to the beneficence of his reign, although he\r\nfailed to account for the continued dulness of the latter royal borough,\r\nwhere he himself resided, and whose picture-galleries he had restored\r\nand thrown open to the public, besides having the great fountains to\r\nplay every first Sunday of the month.\r\n\r\nOne day the king sent for M. de Montalivet, and told him that, though\r\ngratified at the revived prosperity of Saint-Germain, he would like to\r\nsee a little more gaiety at Versailles.\r\n\r\n\"You really mean it, sire?\" asked the minister.\r\n\r\n\"Not only do I mean it, but I confess to you that it would give me great\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sire, Alexandre Dumas has lately been sentenced to a fortnight's\r\nimprisonment for neglecting his duty in the National Guards: make an\r\norder for him to spend that fortnight in Versailles, and I guarantee\r\nyour Majesty that Versailles will be lively enough.\"\r\n\r\nLouis-Philippe did not act upon the suggestion. The only member of the\r\nd'Orléans' family who was truly sympathetic to Dumas was the king's\r\neldest son, whose untimely death shortly afterwards affected the great\r\nnovelist very much, albeit that he frankly acknowledged to regretting\r\nthe man and not the future ruler; for while loudly professing his\r\nrepublican creed, he never pretended to overlook his indebtedness to\r\nLouis-Philippe, when Duc d'Orléans, for having befriended him; nay, I am\r\ninclined to think that Dumas' gratitude was far greater than the case\r\nwarranted. When, in 1847, the fancy took him to go into parliament, he\r\nnaturally turned to the borough he had benefited so much by his stay\r\nthere--Saint-Germain, and Saint-Germain denied him. They thought him too\r\nimmoral. Dumas waited patiently for another opportunity, which did not\r\ncome until the following year, when Louis-Philippe had abdicated.\r\nAddressing a meeting of electors at Joigny, he was challenged by a M. de\r\nBonnelière to reconcile his title of republican with his title of\r\nMarquis de la Pailleterie, and the fact of his having been a secretary\r\nto the Duc d'Orléans, although he had never occupied so important a\r\nposition in the Duc d'Orléans' household. His reply was simply scathing,\r\nand I give it in full as the papers of the day reproduced it. \"No\r\ndoubt,\" he said, in an off-hand, bantering way, \"I was formerly called\r\nthe Marquis de la Pailleterie, which was my father's name, and of which\r\nI was very proud, being unable then to claim a glorious one of my own\r\nmake. But at present, when I am somebody, I call myself Alexandre Dumas\r\nand nothing more; and everybody knows me, you among the rest--you, you\r\nabsolute nobody, who have merely come to be able to boast to-morrow,\r\nafter insulting me to-night, that you have known the great Dumas. If\r\nsuch was your ambition, you might have satisfied it without failing in\r\nthe common courtesies of a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the applause which the reply provoked had subsided, Dumas went on:\r\n\"There is also no doubt about my having been a secretary to the Duc\r\nd'Orléans, and that I have received all kinds of favours from his\r\nfamily. If you, citizen, are ignorant of the meaning of the term, 'the\r\nmemory of the heart,' allow me at least to proclaim here in my loudest\r\nvoice, that I am not, and that I entertain towards this royal family all\r\nthe devotion an honourable man can feel.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, however, not my intention to sketch Alexandre Dumas as a\r\npolitician, for which career I considered him singularly unfit; but the\r\nspeech from which I extracted the foregoing contains a few lines which,\r\nmore than thirty-five years after they were spoken, cannot fail to\r\nstrike the reader with his marvellous foresight. \"Geographically,\" he\r\nsaid, commenting upon the political state of Europe, \"Prussia has the\r\nform of a serpent, and, like it, she seems to be asleep, and to gather\r\nher strength in order to swallow everything around her--Denmark,\r\nHolland, Belgium, and, when she shall have swallowed all that, you will\r\nfind that Austria will be swallowed in its turn, and perhaps, alas,\r\nFrance also.\"\r\n\r\nThe last words, as may be imagined, provoked a storm of hisses;\r\nnevertheless, he kept his audience spellbound until midnight.\r\n\r\nA parliamentary candidate, however eloquent, who flings his constituents\r\ninto the river when they happen to annoy him, must have been a novelty\r\neven in those days, and that is what Dumas did to two brawlers after\r\nsaid meeting, just to show them that his \"aristocratic grip\" was worth\r\ntheir \"plebeian one.\"\r\n\r\nA few years later, at a dinner at Dumas', in the Rue d'Amsterdam, I met\r\na Monsieur du Chaffault who had been an eye-witness of this, as well as\r\nof other scenes during that memorable day. Until the morning of that\r\nday, M. du Chaffault had never set eyes on the great novelist; in the\r\nevening, he was his friend for life. It only proves once more the\r\nirresistible fascination Dumas exercised over every one with whom he\r\ncame in contact, because the beginning of that friendship cost M. du\r\nChaffault six hundred francs, the expenses of that part of the electoral\r\ncampaign. The story, as told by M. du Chaffault the following afternoon\r\nin the Café Riche to Dr. Véron, myself, and Joseph Méry, is too good to\r\nbe missed. I give it as near as I can remember.\r\n\r\n\"I was about twenty-four then, with nothing particular to do, and a\r\nmoderate private income. They were painting and whitewashing my place, a\r\nfew miles away from Sens, and I had taken up my quarters in the\r\nprincipal hotel in the town. The first elections under the second\r\nrepublic were being held. There was a good deal of excitement\r\neverywhere, and I liked it, though not taking the slightest interest in\r\npolitics. This was in May, 1848; and about six, one morning while I was\r\nstill in bed, the door of my room was suddenly opened without knocking,\r\nand what seemed to me a big black monster stood before me. There was a\r\npistol lying by the side of me, and I was reaching towards it, when he\r\nspoke. 'Don't alarm yourself,' he said; 'I am Alexandre Dumas. They told\r\nme you were a good fellow, and I have come to ask you a service.'\r\n\r\n\"I had never seen Dumas in the flesh, only a portrait of him, but I\r\nrecognized him immediately. 'You have often afforded me a great deal of\r\namusement, but I confess you frightened me,' I said. 'What, in Heaven's\r\nname, do you want at this unholy hour?'\r\n\r\n\"'I have slept here,' was the answer. 'I landed here at midnight, and am\r\nstarting for Joigny by-and-by, to attend a political meeting. I am\r\nputting up as a member for your department.'\r\n\r\n\"I jumped out of bed at once, Dumas handed me my trousers, and, when I\r\ngot as far as my boots, he says, 'Oh, while I think of it, I have come\r\nto ask you for a pair of boots; in stepping into the carriage, one of\r\nmine has come to utter grief, and there is no shop open.'\r\n\r\n\"As you may see for yourselves, I am by no means a giant, and Dumas is\r\none. I pointed this out to him, but he did not even answer me. He had\r\ncaught sight of three or four pair of boots under the dressing-table,\r\nand, in the twinkling of an eye, chose the best pair and pulled them on,\r\nleaving me his old ones, absolutely worn out, but which I have preserved\r\nin my library at home. I always show them to my visitors as the thousand\r\nand first volume of Alexandre Dumas.[8]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 8: Alexandre Dumas had a marvellously small\r\n         foot.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"By the time he got the boots on we were friends, as if we had known one\r\nanother for years; as for Dumas, he was 'theeing' and 'thouing' me as if\r\nwe had been at school together.\r\n\r\n\"'You are going to Joigny?' I said; 'I know a good many people there.'\r\n\r\n\"'All the better, for I am going to take you along with me.'\r\n\r\n\"Having to go no further than Joigny, and being taken thither in the\r\nconveyance of my newly-made friend, I did not think it necessary to\r\nprovide myself with an extra supply of funds, the more that I had\r\nbetween five and six hundred francs in my pocket. In a short time we\r\nwere on our road, and the first stage of three hours seemed to me as\r\nmany minutes. Whenever we passed a country seat, out came a lot of\r\nanecdotes and legends connected with its owners, interlarded with quaint\r\nfancies and epigrams. At that first change of horses Dumas' secretary\r\npaid. At the second, Villevailles, Dumas says, 'Have you got twenty\r\nfrancs change?' Without a moment's hesitation, I took out my purse, paid\r\nthe money, and put down in my pocket-book, 'Alexandre Dumas, twenty\r\nfrancs.' I might have saved myself the trouble, as I found out in a very\r\nshort time, for the moment he got out at Joigny, he rushed off in a\r\nhurry without troubling about anything. The postilion turned to me for\r\nhis money, and I paid, and put down once more, 'Alexandre Dumas, thirty\r\nfrancs.'\r\n\r\n\"The first meeting was fixed for four, at the theatre. They applied to\r\nme for the hire of the building, for the gas. I went on paying, but I no\r\nlonger put down the items, saying to myself, 'When my six hundred francs\r\nare gone, my little excursion will be at an end, and I'll go back to\r\nSens.' The little excursion did not extend to more than one day, seeing\r\nthat I had to settle the dinner bill at the Duc de Bourgogne, Dumas\r\nhaving invited every one he met on his way. I am only sorry for one\r\nthing, that I did not have ten thousand francs in my pocket that morning\r\nin order to prolong my excursion for a week or so. But next morning my\r\npurse was empty, and 'our defeat was certain.' I had already identified\r\nmyself with Dumas' aspirations, so I returned to Sens by myself, but\r\noverjoyed at having seen and spoken to this man of genius, who is richer\r\nthan all the millionnaires in the world put together, seeing that he\r\nnever troubles himself about paying, and has therefore no need to worry\r\nabout money. Three months afterwards, the printer at Joigny drew upon me\r\nfor a hundred francs for electioneering bills, which, of course, I could\r\nnot have ordered, but which draft I settled as joyfully as I had settled\r\nthe rest. I have preserved the draft with the boots; they are mementoes\r\nof my first two days' friendship with my dear friend.\"\r\n\r\nAt the first blush, all this sounds very much as if we were dealing with\r\na mere Harold Skimpole, but no man was more unlike Dickens' creation\r\nthan Alexandre Dumas. M. du Chaffault described him rightly when he said\r\nthat he did not worry about money, not even his own. \"My biographer,\"\r\nDumas often said, \"will not fail to point out that I was 'a panier\r\npercé,'[9] neglecting, as a matter of course, to mention that, as a\r\nrule, it was not I who made the holes.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 9: Literally, a basket with holes in it;\r\n         figuratively, the term applied to irreclaimable\r\n         spendthrifts.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe biographers have not been quite so unjust as that. Unfortunately,\r\nfew of them knew Dumas intimately, and they were so intent upon\r\nsketching the playwright and the novelist that they neglected the man.\r\nThey could have had the stories of Alexandra Dumas' improvidence with\r\nregard to himself and his generosity to others for the asking from his\r\nfamiliars. On the other hand, the latter have only told these stories in\r\na fragmentary way; a complete collection of them would be impossible,\r\nfor no one, not even Dumas himself, knew half the people whom he\r\nbefriended. In that very apartment of the Rue d'Amsterdam which I\r\nmentioned just now, the board was free to any and every one who chose to\r\ncome in. Not once, but a score of times, have I heard Dumas ask, after\r\nthis or that man had left the table, \"Who is he? what's his name?\"\r\nWhosoever came with, or at the tail, not of a friend, but of a simple\r\nacquaintance, especially if the acquaintance happened to wear skirts,\r\nwas immediately invited to breakfast or dinner as the case might be.\r\nCount de Cherville once told me that Dumas, having taken a house at\r\nVarenne-Saint-Hilaire, his second month's bill for meat alone amounted\r\nto eleven hundred francs. Let it be remembered that his household\r\nconsisted of himself, two secretaries, and three servants, and that\r\nmoney went a great deal further than it does at present, especially in\r\nprovincial France, in some parts of which living is still very cheap. In\r\nconsequence of one of those financial crises, which were absolutely\r\nperiodical with Alexandre Dumas, M. de Cherville had prevailed upon him\r\nto leave Paris for a while, and to take up his quarters with him. All\r\nwent comparatively well as long as he was M. de Cherville's guest; but,\r\nhaving taken a liking to the neighbourhood, he rented a house of his\r\nown, and furnished it from garret to cellar in the most expensive way,\r\nas if he were going to spend the remainder of his life in it. Exclusive\r\nof the furniture, he spent between fifteen thousand and eighteen\r\nthousand francs on hangings, painting, and repairs. The parasites and\r\nharpies which M. de Cherville had kept at bay came down upon him like a\r\nswarm of locusts. \"And how long, think you, did Dumas stay in his new\r\ndomicile? Three months, not a day more nor less. As a matter of course,\r\nthe furniture did not fetch a quarter of its cost; the repairs, the\r\ndecorating, etc., were so much sheer waste: for the incoming tenant\r\nrefused to refund a cent for it, and Dumas, having made up his mind to\r\ngo to Italy, would not wait for a more liberal or conscientious one,\r\nlest he should have the rent of the empty house on his shoulders also.\r\nLuckily, I took care that he should pocket the proceeds of the sale of\r\nthe furniture.\"\r\n\r\nThis last sentence wants explaining. As a rule, when a man sells his\r\nsticks, he pockets the money. But the instance just mentioned was the\r\nonly one in which Dumas had the disposal of his household goods. The\r\npresiding divinity invariably carried them away with her when she had to\r\nmake room for a successor, and these successions generally occurred\r\nonce, sometimes twice, a year. \"La reine est morte, vive la reine.\" The\r\nnew sovereign, for the first few days of her reign, had to be content\r\nwith bare walls and very few material comforts; then the nest was\r\nupholstered afresh, and \"il n'y avait rien de changé en la demeure, sauf\r\nle nom de la maîtresse.\"\r\n\r\nConsequently, though for forty years Alexandre Dumas could not have\r\nearned less than eight thousand pounds per annum; though he neither\r\nsmoked, drank, nor gambled; though, in spite of his mania for cooking,\r\nhe himself was the most frugal eater--the beef from the soup of the\r\nprevious day, grilled, was his favourite dish,--it rained writs and\r\nsummonses around him, while he himself was frequently without a penny.\r\n\r\nM. du Chaffault one day told me of a scene _à propos_ of this which is\r\nworth reproducing. He was chatting to Dumas in his study, when a visitor\r\nwas shown in. He turned out to be an Italian man of letters and refugee,\r\non the verge of starvation. M. du Chaffault could not well make out what\r\nwas said, because they were talking Italian, but all at once Dumas got\r\nup and took from the wall behind him a magnificent pistol, one of a\r\npair. The visitor walked off with it, to M. du Chaffault's surprise.\r\nWhen he was gone, Dumas turned to his friend and explained: \"He was\r\nutterly penniless, and so am I; so I gave him the pistol.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Heavens, you surely did not recommend him to go and make an end\r\nof himself!\" interrupted du Chaffault.\r\n\r\nDumas burst out laughing. \"Of course not. I merely told him to go and\r\nsell or pawn it, and leave me the fellow one, in case some other poor\r\nwretch should want assistance while I am so terribly hard up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in this very Rue d'Amsterdam, whether Dumas was terribly\r\nimpecunious or not, the déjeûner, which generally began at about\r\nhalf-past eleven, was rarely finished before half-past four, because\r\nduring the whole of that time fresh contingents arrived to be fed, and\r\ncommunication was kept up between the apartment and the butcher for\r\ncorresponding fresh supplies of beefsteaks and cutlets.\r\n\r\nIs it a wonder, then, that it rained summonses, and writs, and other law\r\ndocuments? But no one took much notice of these, not even one of the\r\nfour secretaries, who was specially appointed to look after these\r\nthings. If I remember aright, his name was Hirschler. The names of the\r\nother three secretaries were Rusconi, Viellot, and Fontaine.\r\nUnfortunately, Hirschler was as dilatory as his master, and, until the\r\nprocess-server claimed a personal interview, as indifferent. These\r\n\"limbs of the law\" were marvellously polite. I was present one day at an\r\ninterview between one of these and Hirschler, for Dumas' dwelling was\r\nabsolutely and literally the glass house of the ancient\r\nphilosopher--with this difference, that no one threw any stones _from_\r\nit. There was no secret, no skeleton in the cupboard; the impecuniosity\r\nand the recurrent periods of plenty were both as open as the day.\r\n\r\nThe \"man of law\" and Hirschler began by shaking hands, for they were old\r\nacquaintances; it would have been difficult to find a process-server in\r\nParis who was not an old acquaintance of Dumas. After which the visitor\r\ninformed Hirschler that he had come to distrain.\r\n\r\n\"To distrain? I did not know we had got as far as that,\" said Hirschler.\r\n\"Wait a moment. I must go and see.\" It meant that Hirschler repaired to\r\nthe kitchen, where stood a large oaken sideboard, in a capacious drawer\r\nof which all the law documents, no matter by whom received, were\r\nindiscriminately thrown, to be fished out when the \"mauvais quart\r\nd'heure\" came, and not until then.\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Hirschler, but not in the least worried or\r\nexcited, \"I really did not know we had got as far as that. I must ask\r\nyou to wait another minute. I suppose a third or a fourth of the total\r\namount will do for the present?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do not know,\" said the process-server with most exquisite\r\npoliteness. \"Try what you can do. I fancy that with a third I may manage\r\nto stop proceedings for a while.\"\r\n\r\nThe third or fourth part of the debt was rarely in the house; messengers\r\nhad to be despatched for it to Cadot, the publisher, or to the cashier\r\nof the _Moniteur_, _Constitutionnel_, or _Siècle_. Meanwhile the\r\nprocess-server was feasted in a sumptuous way, and when the messenger\r\nreturned with the sum in question, Hirschler and the process-server\r\nshook hands once more, with the most cordial _au revoir_ possible.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, the same process-server reappeared upon the scene\r\nin a few months. The comedy had often as many as a dozen\r\nrepresentations, so that it may safely be said that a great number of\r\nDumas' debts were paid six or seven times over. Even sixpence a line of\r\nsixty letters did not suffice to keep pace with such terrible\r\nimprovidence, though the remuneration was much more frequently fourpence\r\nor fivepence. It rarely rose to sevenpence halfpenny, but in all cases a\r\nthird went to Dumas' collaborateurs, another third to his creditors, and\r\nthe rest to himself.\r\n\r\nI have allowed my pen to run away with me. One more story, and then I\r\nleave Alexandre Dumas for the present. It is simply to show that he\r\nwould have squandered the fortune of all the Rothschilds combined: I\r\nrepeat, not on himself; he would have given it away, or allowed it to be\r\ntaken. He had no notion of the value of money. About a year after I had\r\nmade his acquaintance, he was ill at Saint-Germain, and I went to see\r\nhim. His dog had bitten him severely in the right hand; he was in bed,\r\nand obliged to dictate. His son had just left him, and he told me,\r\nadding, \"C'est un coeur d'or, cet Alexandre.\" Seeing that I did not ask\r\nwhat had elicited the praise, he began telling me.\r\n\r\n\"This morning I received six hundred and fifty francs. Just now\r\nAlexandre was going up to Paris, and he says, 'I'll take fifty francs.'\r\n\r\n\"I did not pay attention, or must have misunderstood; at any rate I\r\nreplied, 'Don't take as much as that; leave me a hundred francs.'\r\n\r\n\"'What do you mean, father?' he asked. 'I am telling you that I am going\r\nto take fifty francs.'\r\n\r\n\"'I beg your pardon,' I said. 'I understood you were going to take six\r\nhundred.'\"\r\n\r\nHe would have considered it the most natural thing in the world for his\r\nson to take six hundred and leave him fifty; just as he considered it\r\nthe most natural thing to bare his arm and to have a dozen leeches put\r\non it, because his son, when a boy of eight, having met with an\r\naccident, would not consent to blood-letting of that kind. In vain did\r\nthe father tell him that the leeches did not hurt. \"Well, put some on\r\nyourself, and then I will.\" And the giant turned up his sleeves, and did\r\nas he was told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Louis Véron -- The real man as distinguished from that of his\r\n     own \"Memoirs\" -- He takes the management of the Paris Opéra --\r\n     How it was governed before his advent -- Meyerbeer's \"Robert le\r\n     Diable\" _underlined_ -- Meyerbeer and his doubts upon the merits\r\n     of his work -- Meyerbeer's generosity -- Meyerbeer and the\r\n     beggars of the Rue Le Peletier -- Dr. Véron, the inventor of the\r\n     modern newspaper puff -- Some specimens of advertisements in\r\n     their infancy -- Dr. Véron takes a leaf from the book of Molière\r\n     -- Dr. Véron's love of money -- His superstitions -- His\r\n     objections to travelling in railways -- He quotes the Queen of\r\n     England as an example -- When Queen Victoria overcomes her\r\n     objection, Véron holds out -- \"Queen Victoria has got a\r\n     successor: the Véron dynasty begins and ends with me\" -- Thirteen\r\n     at table -- I make the acquaintance of Taglioni -- The woman and\r\n     the ballerina -- Her adventure at Perth -- An improvised\r\n     performance of \"Nathalie, la Laitière Suisse\" -- Another\r\n     adventure in Russia -- A modern Claude Du-Val -- My last meeting\r\n     with Taglioni -- A dinner-party at De Morny's -- A comedy scene\r\n     between husband and wife -- Flotow, the composer of \"Martha\" --\r\n     His family -- His father's objection to the composer's profession\r\n     -- The latter's interview with M. de Saint-Georges, the author of\r\n     the libretto of Balfe's \"Bohemian Girl\" -- M. de Saint-Georges\r\n     prevails upon the father to let his son study in Paris for five\r\n     years, and to provide for him during that time -- The supplies\r\n     are stopped on the last day of the fifth year -- Flotow, at the\r\n     advice of M. de Saint-Georges, stays on and lives by giving\r\n     piano-lessons -- His earthly possessions at his first success --\r\n     \"Rob Roy\" at the Hôtel Castellane -- Lord Granville's opinion of\r\n     the music -- The Hôtel Castellane and some Paris salons during\r\n     Louis-Philippe's reign -- The Princesse de Lieven's, M.

They are full of interesting facts\r\nfrom beginning to end, especially to those who did not know intimately\r\nthe author or the times of which he treats. Those who did are tempted to\r\nrepeat the mot of Diderot when they gave him the portrait of his father.\r\n\"This is my Sunday father; I want my everyday father.\" The painter, in\r\nfact, had represented the worthy cutler of Langres in his best coat and\r\nwig, etc.; not as his son had been in the habit of seeing him. The Dr.\r\nVéron of the \"Memoirs\" is not the Dr. Véron of the Café de Paris, nor\r\nthe Dr. Véron of the _avant-scène_ in his own theatre, snoring a duet\r\nwith Auber, and \"keeping better time than the great composer himself;\"\r\nhe is not the Dr. Véron full of fads and superstitions and uniformly\r\nkind, \"because kindness is as a rule a capital investment;\" he is not\r\nthe cheerful pessimist we knew; he is a grumbling optimist, as the\r\njournalists of his time have painted him; in short, in his book he is a\r\nquasi-philanthropic illusion, while in reality he was a hard-hearted,\r\nshrewd business man who did good by stealth now and then, but never\r\nblushed to find it fame.\r\n\r\nThe event which proved the starting-point of Dr. Véron's celebrity was\r\nneither of his own making nor of his own seeking. Though it happened\r\nwhen I was a mere lad, I have heard it discussed in after-years\r\nsufficiently often and by very good authorities to be confident of my\r\nfacts. In June, 1831, Dr. Véron took the management of the Paris Opéra,\r\nwhich up till then had been governed on the style of the old régime,\r\nnamely, by three gentlemen of the king's household with a working\r\ndirector under them. The royal privy purse was virtually responsible for\r\nits liabilities. Louis-Philippe shifted the burden of that\r\nresponsibility on the State, and limited its extent. The three gentlemen\r\nof the king's household were replaced by a royal commissioner, and the\r\nyearly subsidy fixed at £32,500; still a pretty round sum, which has\r\nbeen reduced since by £500 only.\r\n\r\nAt Dr. Véron's advent, Meyerbeer's \"Robert le Diable\" was, what they\r\ncall in theatrical parlance, \"underlined,\" or, if not underlined, at\r\nleast definitely accepted. Only one work of his had at that time been\r\nheard in Paris, \"Il Crociato in Egitto.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine, after so many years, whether Dr. Véron,\r\nnotwithstanding his artistic instincts, was greatly smitten with the\r\nGerman composer's masterpiece. It has often been argued that he was not,\r\nbecause he insisted upon an indemnity of forty thousand francs from the\r\nGovernment towards the cost of its production. In the case of a man like\r\nVéron, this proves nothing at all. He may have been thoroughly convinced\r\nof the merits of \"Robert le Diable,\" and as thoroughly confident of its\r\nsuccess with the public, though no manager, not even the most\r\nexperienced, can be; it would not have prevented him from squeezing the\r\nforty thousand francs from the minister on the plea that the performance\r\nof the work was imposed upon him by a treaty of his predecessor. To Dr.\r\nVéron's credit be it said that he might have saved himself the hard\r\ntussle he had with the minister by simply applying for the money to\r\nMeyerbeer himself, who would have given it without a moment's\r\nhesitation, rather than see the success of \"Robert le Diable\"\r\njeopardized by inefficient mounting, although up to the last Meyerbeer\r\ncould never make up his mind whether magnificent scenery and gorgeous\r\ndresses were an implied compliment or the reverse to the musical value\r\nof his compositions. _À propos_ of this there is a very characteristic\r\nstory. At one of the final dress-rehearsals of \"Robert le Diable,\"\r\nMeyerbeer felt much upset. At the sight of that beautiful set of the\r\ncloister of Sainte-Rosalie, where the nuns rise from their tombs, at the\r\neffect produced by the weird procession, Meyerbeer came up to Véron.\r\n\r\n\"My dear director,\" he said, \"I perceive well enough that you do not\r\ndepend upon the opera itself; you are, in fact, running after a\r\nspectacular success.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till the fourth act,\" replied Véron, who was above all logical.\r\n\r\nThe curtain rose upon the fourth act, and what did Meyerbeer behold?\r\nInstead of the vast, grandiose apartment he had conceived for Isabella,\r\nPrincess of Sicily, he found a mean, shabby set, which would have been\r\ndeemed scarcely good enough for a minor theatre.\r\n\r\n\"Decidedly, my dear director,\" said Meyerbeer, with a bitter twinge in\r\nhis features and voice, \"I perceive well enough that you have no faith\r\nin my score; you did not even dare go to the expense of a new set. I\r\nwould willingly have paid for it myself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he would willingly have paid for it, because Meyerbeer was not only\r\nvery rich, but very generous.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very funny thing,\" said Lord ----, as he came into the Café de\r\nParis one morning, many years afterwards; \"there are certain days in the\r\nweek when the Rue Le Peletier seems to be swarming with beggars, and,\r\nwhat is funnier still, they don't take any notice of me. I pass\r\nabsolutely scot-free.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet,\" remarked Roger de Beauvoir, \"that they are playing 'Robert\r\nle Diable' or 'Les Huguenots' to-night, and I can assure you that I have\r\nnot seen the bills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now that you speak of it, they are playing 'Les Huguenots' to-night,\"\r\nreplied Lord ----; \"but what has that to do with it? I am not aware that\r\nthe Paris beggars manifest a particular predilection for Meyerbeer's\r\noperas, and that they are booking their places on the days they are\r\nperformed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's simply this,\" explained De Beauvoir: \"both Rossini and Meyerbeer\r\nnever fail to come of a morning to look at the bills, and when the\r\nlatter finds his name on them, he is so overjoyed that he absolutely\r\nempties his pockets of all the cash they contain. Notwithstanding his\r\nmany years of success, he is still afraid that the public's liking for\r\nhis music is merely a passing fancy, and as every additional performance\r\ndecreases this apprehension, he thinks he cannot be sufficiently\r\nthankful to Providence. His gratitude shows itself in almsgiving.\"\r\n\r\nI made it my business subsequently to verify what I considered De\r\nBeauvoir's fantastical statement, and I found it substantially correct.\r\n\r\nTo return to Dr. Véron, who, there is no doubt, did the best he could\r\nfor \"Robert le Diable,\" to which and to the talent of Taglioni he owed\r\nhis fortune. At the same time, it would be robbing him of part of his\r\nglory did we not state that the success of that great work might have\r\nbeen less signal but for him; both his predecessors and successors had\r\nand have still equally good chances without having availed themselves\r\nof them, either in the interest of lyrical art or in that of the public.\r\n\r\nI compared Dr. Véron just now to Phineas Barnum, and the comparison was\r\nnot made at random. Dr. Véron was really the inventor of the newspaper\r\npuff direct and indirect--of that personal journalism which records the\r\nslightest deed or gesture of the popular theatrical manager, and which\r\nat the present day is carried to excess. And all his subordinates and\r\nco-workers were made to share the advantages of the system, because\r\ntheir slightest doings also reflected glory upon him. An artist filling\r\nat a moment's notice the part of a fellow-artist who had become suddenly\r\nill, a carpenter saving by his presence of mind the situation at a\r\ncritical juncture, had not only his paragraph in next morning's papers,\r\nbut a whole column, containing the salient facts of his life and career.\r\nIt was the system of Frederick the Great and of the first Napoléon,\r\nacknowledging the daring deeds of their smallest as well as of their\r\nforemost aids--with this difference, that the French captain found it\r\nconvenient to suppress them now and then, and that Dr. Véron never\r\nattempted to do so. When the idea of putting down these notes first\r\nentered my mind, I looked over some files of newspapers of that\r\nparticular period, and there was scarcely one between 1831 and 1835 that\r\ndid not contain a lengthy reference to the Grand Opéra and its director.\r\nI was irresistibly reminded of the bulletins the great Napoléon dictated\r\non the battle-field. I have also seen a collection of posters relating\r\nto the same brilliant reign at the Opéra. Of course, compared to the\r\neloquent effusions and ingenious attempts of the contemporary theatrical\r\nmanager to bait the public, Véron's are mere child's play; still we must\r\nremember that the art of puffing was in its infancy, and, as such, some\r\nof them are worth copying. The public was not so _blasé_ and it\r\nswallowed the bait eagerly. Here they are.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow tenth performance of ..., which henceforth will only be\r\nplayed at rare intervals.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow twentieth performance of ...; positively the last before the\r\ndeparture of M....\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow seventeenth performance of ...; reappearance of Madame ...\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow fifteenth performance of ... by all the principal artists who\r\n'created' the parts.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow thirtieth performance of ...

In the Ball-Room Scene a new\r\npas de Châles will be introduced.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow thirtieth performance of .... This successful work must be\r\nmomentarily suspended owing to previous arrangements.\"\r\n\r\nChildish as these lines may look to the present generation, they\r\nproduced a fortune of £2000 a year to Dr. Véron in four years, and, but\r\nfor the outbreak of the cholera in '32, when \"Robert le Diable\" was in\r\nthe flush of its success, would have produced another £1000 per annum.\r\nAt that time Dr. Véron had already been able to put aside £24,000, and\r\nhe might have easily closed his theatre during those terrible months;\r\nbut, like Molière, he asked himself what would become of all those who\r\nwere dependent upon him, and had not put aside anything; so he made his\r\nsavings into ten parcels, intending to hold out as many months without\r\nasking help of any one. Five of the parcels went. At the beginning of\r\nthe sixth month the cholera abated; by the end it had almost\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThose who would infer from this that Dr. Véron was indifferent to money,\r\nwould make a great mistake. But he would not allow his love of it to get\r\nthe upper hand, to come between him and his conscience, to make him\r\ncommit either a dishonest or a foolish act. By a foolish act he meant\r\nheadlong speculation. When the shares of the Northern Railway were\r\nallotted, Dr. Véron owned the _Constitutionnel_; 150 shares were\r\nallotted to him, which at that moment represented a clear profit of\r\n60,000 francs, they being 400 francs above par. Dr. Véron made up his\r\nmind to realize there and then. But it was already late; the Bourse was\r\nclosed, the stockbrokers had finished business for the day. He, however,\r\nmet one on the Boulevards, who gave him a cheque for 55,000 francs on\r\nthe Bank of France, which could only be cashed next day. The shares were\r\nleft meanwhile in Dr. Véron's possession. Three minutes after the\r\nbargain was concluded Dr. Véron went back to his office. \"I must have\r\nready money for this, or decline the transaction,\" he said. The\r\nstockbroker, by applying to two of his colleagues, managed to scrape\r\ntogether 50,000 francs. Dr. Véron gave him a receipt in full, returned\r\nhome, singing as he went the French version of \"A bird in the hand,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\nVéron was exceedingly superstitious, and had fads. He could never be\r\ninduced to take a railway journey. It was generally known in France at\r\nthat time that, in the early days of locomotion by steam, Queen Victoria\r\nhad held a similar objection. Véron, when twitted with his objection,\r\ninvariably replied, \"I have yet to learn that the Queen of England is\r\nless enlightened than any of you, and she will not enter a railway\r\ncarriage.\" But one day the report spread that the queen had made a\r\njourney from Windsor to London by the \"iron horse,\" and then Véron was\r\nsorely pressed. He had his answer ready. \"The Queen of England has got a\r\nsuccessor: the Véron dynasty begins and ends with me. I must take care\r\nto make it last as long as possible.\" He stuck to his text till the end\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\nOn no consideration would Véron have sat down \"thirteen at table.\" Once\r\nor twice when the guests and host made up that number, his coachman's\r\nson was sent for, dressed, and made presentable, and joined the party;\r\nat others he politely requested two or three of us to go and dine at the\r\nCafé de Paris, and to have the bill sent to him. We drew lots as to who\r\nwas to go.\r\n\r\nIt was through Dr. Véron that I became acquainted with most of the\r\noperatic celebrities--Meyerbeer, Halévy, Auber, Duprez, etc.; for though\r\nhe had abdicated his directorship seven or eight years before we met, he\r\nwas perhaps a greater power then in the lyrical world than at the date\r\nof his reign.\r\n\r\nIt was at Dr. Véron's that I saw Mdlle. Taglioni for the first time--off\r\nthe stage. It must have been in 1844, for she had not been in Paris\r\nsince 1840, when I had seen her dance at the Opéra. I had only seen her\r\ndance once before that, in '36 or '37, but I was altogether too young to\r\njudge then. I own that in 1840 I was somewhat disappointed, and my\r\ndisappointment was shared by many, because some of my friends, to whom I\r\ncommunicated my impressions, told me that her three years' absence had\r\nmade a vast difference in her art. In '44 it was still worse; her\r\nperformances gave rise to many a spiteful epigram, for she herself\r\ninvited comparison between her former glory and her decline, by dancing\r\nin one of her most successful creations, \"L'Ombre.\" Those most leniently\r\ndisposed towards her thought what Alfred de Musset so gracefully\r\nexpressed when requested to write some verses in her album.\r\n\r\n  \"Si vous ne voulez plus danser,\r\n   Si vous ne faites que passer\r\n   Sur ce grand théâtre si sombre,\r\n   Ne courez pas après votre ombre\r\n   Et tâchez de nous la laisser.\"\r\n\r\nMy disappointment with the ballerina was as nothing, however, to my\r\ndisappointment with the woman. I had been able to determine for myself\r\nbefore then that Marie Taglioni was by no means a good-looking woman,\r\nbut I did not expect her to be so plain as she was. That, after all, was\r\nnot her fault; but she might have tried to make amends for her lack of\r\npersonal charms by her amiability. She rarely attempted to do so, and\r\nnever with Frenchmen. Her reception of them was freezing to a degree,\r\nand on the occasions--few and far between--when she thawed, it was with\r\nRussians, Englishmen, or Viennese. Any male of the Latin races she held\r\nmetaphorically as well as literally at arm's length. Of the\r\ngracefulness, so apparent on the stage, even in her decline, there was\r\nnot a trace to be found in private life. One of her shoulders was higher\r\nthan the other; she limped slightly, and, moreover, waddled like a duck.\r\nThe pinched mouth was firmly set; there was no smile on the colourless\r\nlips, and she replied to one's remarks in monosyllables.\r\n\r\nTruly she had suffered a cruel wrong at the hands of men--of one man,\r\nbien entendu; nevertheless, the wonder to most people who knew her was\r\nnot that Comte Gilbert de Voisins should have left her so soon after\r\ntheir marriage, but that he should have married her at all. \"The fact\r\nwas,\" said some one with whom I discussed the marriage one day, \"that De\r\nVoisins considered himself in honour bound to make that reparation, but\r\nI cannot conceive what possessed him to commit the error that made the\r\nreparation necessary.\" And I am bound to say that it was not the utter\r\nlack of personal attractions that made every one, men and women alike,\r\nindifferent to Taglioni. She was what the French call \"une\r\n_pimbêche_.\"[10] \"Am I not a good-natured woman?\" said Mdlle. Mars one\r\nday to Hoffman, the blood-curdling novelist. \"Mademoiselle, you are the\r\nmost amiable creature I know between the footlights and the cloth,\" he\r\nreplied. No one could have paid Taglioni even such a left-handed\r\ncompliment, for, if all I heard was true, she was not good-tempered\r\neither on or off the stage. Dr. Véron, who was really a very loyal\r\nfriend, was very reticent about her character, and would never be drawn\r\ninto revelations. \"You know the French proverb,\" he said once, when I\r\npressed him very closely. \"'On ne hérite pas de ceux que l'on tue;' and,\r\nafter all, she helped me to make my fortune.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 10: The word \"shrew\" is the nearest\r\n         equivalent.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThat evening I was seated next to Mdlle. Taglioni at dinner, and when\r\nshe discovered my nationality she unbent a little, so that towards the\r\ndessert we were on comparatively friendly terms. She had evidently very\r\ngrateful recollections of her engagements in London, for it was the only\r\ntopic on which I could get her to talk on that occasion. Here is a\r\nlittle story I had from her own lips, and which shows the Scotch of the\r\nearly thirties in quite a new light. It may have been known once, but\r\nhas been probably forgotten by now, except by the \"oldest inhabitant\" of\r\nPerth. In 1832 or 1833--I will not vouch for the exact year, seeing that\r\nit is two score of years since the story was told to me--the season in\r\nLondon had been a fatiguing one for Taglioni. A ballet her father had\r\ncomposed for her, \"Nathalie, ou la Laitière Suisse,\" a very inane thing\r\nby all accounts, had met with great success in London. The scene,\r\nhowever, had, as far as I could make out, been changed from Switzerland\r\nto Scotland, but of this I will not be certain. At the termination of\r\nher engagement Taglioni wanted rest, and she bethought herself to\r\nrecruit in the Highlands. After travelling hither and thither for a\r\nlittle while, she arrived at Perth, and, as a matter of course, put down\r\nher name in the visitors' book of the hotel, then went out to explore\r\nthe sights of the town. Meanwhile the report of her arrival had spread\r\nlike wildfire, and on her return to the hotel she found awaiting her a\r\ndeputation from the principal inhabitants, with the request to honour\r\nthem with a performance. \"The request was so graciously conveyed,\" said\r\nTaglioni, \"that I could not but accept, though I took care to point out\r\nthe difficulties of performing a ballet all by myself, seeing that there\r\nwas neither a corps de ballet, a male dancer, nor any one else to\r\nsupport me. All these objections were overruled by their promise to\r\nprovide all these in the best way they could, and before I had time to\r\nconsider the matter fully, I was taken off in a cab to inspect the\r\ntheatre, etc. Great heavens, what a stage and scenery! Still, I had\r\ngiven my promise, and, seeing their anxiety, would not go back from it.\r\nI cannot tell where they got their _personnel_ from. There was a\r\ndirector and a stage-manager, but as he did not understand French, and\r\nas my English at that time was even worse than it is now, we were\r\nobliged to communicate through an interpreter. His English must have\r\nbeen bewildering, to judge from the manager's blank looks when he spoke\r\nto him, and his French was even more wonderful than my English. He was a\r\nGerman waiter from the hotel.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, thanks to him, I managed to convey the main incidents of\r\nthe plot of 'Nathalie' to the manager, and during the first act, the\r\nmost complicated one, all went well. But at the beginning of the second\r\neverything threatened to come to a standstill. I must tell you that my\r\nfather hit upon the novel idea of introducing a kind of dummy, or lay\r\nfigure, on which this idiotic Nathalie lavishes all her caresses. The\r\nyoung fellow, who is in love with Nathalie, contrives to take the\r\ndummy's place; consequently, in order to preserve some semblance of\r\ntruth, and not to make Nathalie appear more idiotic than she is already,\r\nthere ought to be a kind of likeness between the dummy and the lover. I\r\nknow not whether the interpreter had been at fault, or whether in the\r\nhurry-scurry I had forgotten all about the dummy, but a few minutes\r\nbefore the rise of the curtain I discovered that there was no dummy.\r\n'You must do the dummy,' I said to Pierre, my servant, 'and I'll pretend\r\nto carry you on.' Pierre nodded a silent assent, and immediately began\r\nto don the costume, seeing which I had the curtain rung up, and went on\r\nto the stage. I was not very comfortable, though, for I heard a violent\r\naltercation going on behind the scenes, the cause of which I failed to\r\nguess. I kept dancing and dancing, getting near to the wings every now\r\nand then, to ask whether Pierre was ready. He seemed to me inordinately\r\nlong in changing his dress, but the delay was owing to something far\r\nmore serious than his careful preparation for the part. Pierre had a\r\npair of magnificent whiskers, and the young fellow who enacted the lover\r\nhad not a hair on his face. Pierre was ready to go on, when the manager\r\nnoticed the difference. 'Stop!' he shouted; 'that won't do. You must\r\nhave your whiskers taken off.' Pierre indignantly refused. The manager\r\nendeavoured to persuade him to make the sacrifice, but in vain, until at\r\nlast he had him held down on a chair by two stalwart Scotchmen while\r\nthe barber did his work.\r\n\r\n\"All this had taken time, but the public did not grow impatient. They\r\nwould have been very difficult to please indeed had they behaved\r\notherwise, for I never danced to any audience as I did to them. One of\r\nthe few pleasant recollections in my life is that evening at Perth; and,\r\ncuriously enough, Pierre, who is still with me, refers to it with great\r\nenthusiasm, notwithstanding the cavalier treatment inflicted upon him.\r\nIt was his first and last appearance on any stage.\"\r\n\r\nHere is another story Taglioni told me on a subsequent occasion. I have\r\noften wondered since whether Macaulay would not have been pleased with\r\nit even more than I was.\r\n\r\n\"The St. Petersburg theatrical season of '24-'25 had been particularly\r\nbrilliant, and nowhere more so than at the Italian Opera. I came away\r\nladen with presents, among others one from the Czar--a magnificent\r\nnecklet of very fine pearls. When the theatre closed at Lent, I was very\r\nanxious to get away, in spite of the inclement season, and\r\nnotwithstanding the frequent warnings that the roads were not safe.\r\nWhenever the conversation turned on that topic, the name of Trischka was\r\nsure to crop up; he, in fact, was the leader of a formidable band of\r\nhighwaymen, compared with whose exploits those of all the others seemed\r\nto sink into insignificance. Trischka had been steward to Prince\r\nPaskiwiecz, and was spoken of as a very intelligent fellow. Nearly every\r\none with whom I came in contact had seen him while he was still at St.\r\nPetersburg, and had a good word to say for him. His manners were\r\nreported to be perfect; he spoke French and German very fairly; and,\r\nmost curious of all, he was an excellent dancer. Some went even as far\r\nas to say that if he had adopted that profession, instead of scouring\r\nthe highways, he would have made a fortune. By all accounts he never\r\nmolested poor people, and the rich, whom he laid under contribution, had\r\nnever to complain of violent treatment either in words or deeds--nay,\r\nmore, he never took all they possessed from his victims, he was content\r\nto share and share alike. But papa n'écoutait pas de cet' oreille là;\r\npapa était très peu partageur; and, truth to tell, I was taking away a\r\ngreat deal of money from St. Petersburg--which was perhaps another\r\nreason why papa did not see the necessity of paying tithes to Trischka.\r\nIf we had followed papa's advice, we should have either applied to the\r\nCzar for an armed escort, or else delayed our departure till the middle\r\nof the summer, though he failed to see that the loss of my engagements\r\nelsewhere would have amounted to a serious item also. But papa had got\r\nit into his head not to part with any of the splendid presents I had\r\nreceived; they were mostly jewels, and people who do not know papa can\r\nform no idea what they meant to him. However, as we were plainly told\r\nthat Trischka conducted his operations all the year round, that we were\r\nas likely to be attacked by him in summer as in winter, papa reluctantly\r\nmade up his mind to go in the beginning of April. Papa provided himself\r\nwith a pair of large pistols that would not have hurt a cat, and were\r\nthe laughing-stock of all those who accompanied us for the first dozen\r\nmiles on our journey; for I had made many friends, and they insisted on\r\ndoing this. We had two very roomy carriages. My father, my maid, two\r\nGerman violinists, and myself were in the first; the second contained\r\nour luggage.\r\n\r\n\"At the first change of horses after Pskoff, the postmaster told us that\r\nTrischka and his band had been seen a few days previously on the road to\r\nDunabourg, at the same time, he seemed to think very lightly of the\r\nmatter, and, addressing himself particularly to me, opined that, with a\r\nlittle diplomacy on my part and a good deal of _sang-froid_, I might be\r\nlet off very cheaply. All went well until the middle of the next night,\r\nwhen all of a sudden, in the thick of a dense forest, our road was\r\nbarred by a couple of horsemen, while a third opened the door of our\r\ncarriage. It was Trischka himself. 'Mademoiselle Taglioni?' he said in\r\nvery good German, lifting his hat. 'I am Mademoiselle Taglioni,' I\r\nreplied in French. 'I know,' he answered, with a deeper bow than before.\r\n'I was told you were coming this way. I am sorry, mademoiselle, that I\r\ncould not come to St. Petersburg to see you dance, but as chance has\r\nbefriended me, I hope you will do me the honour to dance before me\r\nhere.' 'How can I dance here, in this road, monsieur?' I said\r\nbeseechingly. 'Alas, mademoiselle, I have no drawing-room to offer you,'\r\nhe replied, still as polite as ever. 'Nevertheless,' he continued, 'if\r\nyou think it cannot be done, I shall be under the painful necessity of\r\nconfiscating your carriages and luggage, and of sending you back on foot\r\nto the nearest post-town.' 'But, monsieur,' I protested, 'the road is\r\nankle-deep in mud.' 'Truly,' he laughed, showing a beautiful set of\r\nteeth, 'but your weight won't make any difference; besides, I dare say\r\nyou have some rugs and cloths with you in the other carriage, and my men\r\nwill only be too pleased to spread them on the ground.'\r\n\r\n\"Seeing that all my remonstrance would be in vain, I jumped out of the\r\ncarriage. While the rugs were being laid down, my two companions, the\r\nviolinists, tuned their instruments, and even papa was prevailed upon to\r\ncome out, though he was sulky and never spoke a word.\r\n\r\n\"I danced for about a quarter of an hour, and I honestly believe that I\r\nnever had such an appreciative audience either before or afterwards.\r\nThen Trischka led me back to the carriage, and, simply lifting his hat,\r\nbade me adieu. 'I keep the rugs, mademoiselle. I will never part with\r\nthem,' he said. The last I saw of him, when our carriages were turning a\r\nbend in the road, was a truly picturesque figure on horseback, waving\r\nhis hand.\"\r\n\r\nMore than eight years elapsed before I met Taglioni again, and then she\r\nlooked absolutely like an old woman, though she was under fifty. It was\r\nat the Comte (afterwards Duc) de Morny's, in '52, and, if I remember\r\nrightly, almost immediately after his resignation as Minister of the\r\nInterior. Taglioni and Mdlle. Rachel were the only women present. Just\r\nas we were sitting down to dinner, Count Gilbert de Voisins came in, and\r\ntook the next seat but one on my left which had been reserved for him.\r\nWe were on friendly, though not on very intimate terms. He was evidently\r\nnot aware of the presence of his wife, for after a few minutes he asked\r\nhis neighbour, pointing to her, \"Who is this governess-looking old\r\nmaid?\" He told him. He showed neither surprise nor emotion; but, if an\r\nartist could have been found to sketch his face there, its perfect blank\r\nwould have been more amusing than either. He seemed, as it were, to\r\nconsult his recollections; then he said, \"Is it? It may be, after all;\"\r\nand went on eating his dinner. His wife acted less diplomatically. She\r\nrecognized him at once, and made a remark to her host in a sufficiently\r\nloud voice to be overheard, which was not in good taste, the more that\r\nDe Morny, notwithstanding his many faults, was not the man to have\r\ninvited both for the mere pleasure of playing a practical joke. In fact,\r\nI have always credited De Morny with the good intention of bringing\r\nabout a reconciliation between the two; but the affair was hopeless from\r\nthe very beginning, after Taglioni's exhibition of temper. I am far\r\nfrom saying that Count Gilbert would have been more tractable if it had\r\nnot occurred, but his spouse shut the door at once upon every further\r\nattempt in that direction. Nevertheless, whether out of sheer devilry or\r\nfrom a wish to be polite, he went up to her after dinner, accompanied by\r\na friend, who introduced him as formally as if he and she had never seen\r\none another. It was at a moment when the Comte de Morny was out of the\r\nroom, because I feel certain that he was already sorry then for what he\r\nhad endeavoured to do, and had washed his hands of the whole affair.\r\nTaglioni made a stately bow. \"I am under the impression,\" she said,\r\n\"that I have had the honour of meeting you before, about the year 1832.\"\r\nWith this she turned away. Let any playwright reproduce that scene in a\r\nfarcical or comedy form, and I am sure that three-fourths of his\r\naudience would scout it as too exaggerated, and yet every incident of it\r\nis absolutely true.\r\n\r\nAmong my most pleasant recollections of those days is that connected\r\nwith Von Flotow, the future composer of \"Martha.\" In appearance he was\r\naltogether unlike the traditional musician; he looked more like a\r\nstalwart officer of dragoons. Though of noble origin, and with a very\r\nwealthy father, there was a time when he had a hard struggle for\r\nexistence. Count von Flotow, his father, and an old officer of Blucher,\r\nwas nearly as much opposed to his son becoming a musician as Frederick\r\nthe Great's. Nevertheless, at the instance of Flotow's mother, he was\r\nsent to Paris at the age of sixteen, and entered the Conservatoire, then\r\nunder the direction of Reicha. His term of apprenticeship was not to\r\nextend beyond two years, \"for,\" said the count, \"it does not take longer\r\nfor the rawest recruit to become a good soldier.\" \"That will give you a\r\nfair idea,\" remarked Von Flotow to me afterwards, \"how much he\r\nunderstood about it. He had an ill-disguised contempt for any music\r\nwhich did not come up to his ideal. His ideal was that performed by the\r\ndrum, the fife, and the bugle. And the very fact of Germany ringing a\r\nfew years later with the names of Meyerbeer and Halévy made matters\r\nworse instead of mending them. His feudal pride would not allow of his\r\nson's entering a profession the foremost ranks of which were occupied by\r\nJews. 'Music,' he said, 'was good enough for bankers' sons and the\r\nlike,' and he considered that Weber had cast a slur upon his family by\r\nadopting it.\"\r\n\r\nThe two years grudgingly allowed by Count von Flotow for his son's\r\nmusical education were interrupted by the revolution of 1830, and the\r\nyoung fellow had to return home before he was eighteen, because, in his\r\nfather's opinion, \"he had not given a sign of becoming a great\r\nmusician;\" in other words, he had not written an opera or anything else\r\nwhich had attracted public notice. However, towards the beginning of\r\n1831, the count took his son to Paris once more; \"and though Meyerbeer\r\nnor Halévy were not so famous then as they were destined to become\r\nwithin the next three years, their names were already sufficiently well\r\nknown to have made an introduction valuable. It would not have been\r\ndifficult to obtain such.\" My father would not hear of it. 'I will not\r\nhave my son indebted for anything to a Jew,' he said; and I am only\r\nquoting this instance of prejudice to you because it was not an\r\nindividual but a typical one among my father's social equals. The remark\r\nabout 'his son's entering a profession in which two Jews had carried off\r\nthe highest prizes' is of a much later date. Consequently we landed in\r\nParis, provided with letters of introduction to M. de Saint-Georges.[11]\r\nClever, accomplished, refined as was M. de Saint-Georges, he was\r\nscarcely the authority a father with serious intentions about his son's\r\nmusical career would have consulted; he was a charming, skilful\r\nlibrettist and dramatist, a thorough man of the world in the best sense\r\nof the word, but absolutely incapable of judging the higher qualities of\r\nthe composer. Nevertheless, I owe him much; but for him I should have\r\nbeen dragged back to Germany there and then; but for him I should have\r\nbeen compelled to go back to Germany five years later, or starved in the\r\nstreets of Paris.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 11: Jules-Henri de Saint-Georges, one of the most\r\n         fertile librettists of the time, the principal collaborateur of\r\n         Scribe, and best known in England as the author of the book of\r\n         Balfe's \"Bohemian Girl.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"My father's interview with M. de Saint-Georges, and my first\r\nintroduction to him,\" said Flotow on another occasion, \"were perhaps the\r\nmost comical scenes ever enacted off the stage. You know my old friend,\r\nand have been to his rooms, so I need not describe him nor his\r\nsurroundings to you. You have never seen my father; but, to give you an\r\nidea of what he was like, I may tell you that he was an enlarged edition\r\nof myself. A bold rider, a soldier and a sportsman, fairly well\r\neducated, but upon the whole a very rough diamond, and, I am afraid,\r\nwith a corresponding contempt for the elegant and artistic side of Paris\r\nlife. You may, therefore, picture to yourself the difference between the\r\ntwo men--M. de Saint-Georges in a beautiful silk dressing-gown and red\r\nmorocco slippers, sipping chocolate from a dainty porcelain cup; my\r\nfather, who, contrary to German custom, had always refused to don that\r\ncomfortable garment, and who, to my knowledge, had never in his life\r\ntasted chocolate. For the moment I thought that everything was lost. I\r\nwas mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"'Monsieur,' said my father in French, which absolutely creaked with the\r\nrust of age, 'I have come to ask your advice and a favour besides. My\r\nson desires to become a musician. Is it possible?'\r\n\r\n\"'There is no reason why he should not be,' replied M. de Saint-Georges,\r\n'provided he has a vocation.'\r\n\r\n\"'Vocation may mean obstinacy,' remarked my father. 'But let us suppose\r\nthe reverse--that obstinacy means vocation: how long would it take him\r\nto prove that he has talent?'\r\n\r\n\"'It is difficult to say--five years at least.'\r\n\r\n\"'And two he has already spent at the Conservatoire will make seven. I\r\nhope he will not be like Jacob, who, after that period of waiting, found\r\nthat they had given him the wrong goddess!' growled my father, who could\r\nbe grimly humorous when he liked. 'Five years more be it, then, but not\r\na single day longer. If by that time he has not made his mark, I\r\nwithdraw his allowance. I thank you for your advice; and now I will ask\r\na favour. Will you kindly supply my place--that is, keep an eye upon\r\nhim, and do the best you can for him? Remember, he is but twenty. It is\r\nhard enough that I cannot make a soldier of him; from what I have heard\r\nand from what I can see, you will prevent him from becoming less than a\r\ngentleman.'\r\n\r\n\"M. de Saint-Georges was visibly moved. 'Let me hear what he can do,' he\r\nsaid, 'and then I will tell you.'\r\n\r\n\"I sat down to the piano for more than an hour.\r\n\r\n\"'I will see that your son becomes a good musician, M. le Comte,' said\r\nM. de Saint-Georges.\r\n\r\n\"Next morning my father went back to Germany. Nothing would induce him\r\nto stay a single day. He said the atmosphere of Paris was vitiated.\r\n\r\n\"I need not tell you that M. de Saint-Georges kept his word as far as he\r\nwas able; he kept it even more rigorously than my father had bargained\r\nfor, because when, exactly on the last day of the stipulated five years,\r\nI received a letter demanding my immediate return, and informing me that\r\nmy father's banker had instructions to stop all further supplies, M. de\r\nSaint-Georges bade me stay.\r\n\r\n\"'I promised to make a musician of you, and I have kept my word. But\r\nbetween a musician and an acknowledged musician there is a difference. I\r\nsay stay!' he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"'How am I to stay without money?'\r\n\r\n\"'You'll earn some.'\r\n\r\n\"'How?'\r\n\r\n\"'By giving piano-lessons, like many a poor artist has done before you.'\r\n\r\n\"I followed his advice, and am none the worse for the few years of\r\nhardships. The contrast between my own poverty and my wealthy\r\nsurroundings was sufficiently curious during that time, and never more\r\nso than on the night when my name really became known to the general\r\npublic. I am alluding to the first performance of 'Le Duc de Guise,'\r\nwhich, as you may remember, was given in aid of the distressed Poles,\r\nand sung throughout by amateurs. The receipts amounted to thirty\r\nthousand francs, and the ladies of the chorus had something between ten\r\nand twelve millions of francs of diamonds in their hair and round their\r\nthroats. All my earthly possessions in money consisted of six francs\r\nthirty-five centimes.\"\r\n\r\nI was not at the Théâtre de la Renaissance that night, but two or three\r\nyears previously I had heard the first opera Flotow ever wrote, at the\r\nHôtel Castellane. I never heard \"Rob Roy\" since; and, curiously enough,\r\nmany years afterwards I inquired of Lord Granville, who sat next to me\r\non that evening in 1838, whether he had. He shook his head negatively.\r\n\"It is a great pity,\" he said, \"for the music is very beautiful.\" And I\r\nbelieve that Lord Granville is a very good judge.\r\n\r\nThe Hôtel Castellane, or \"La Maison du Mouleur,\" as it was called by the\r\ngeneral public on account of the great number of scantily attired\r\nmythological deities with which its façade was decorated, was one of the\r\nfew houses where, during the reign of Louis-Philippe, the discussion of\r\npolitical and dynastic differences was absolutely left in abeyance. The\r\nscent of party strife--I had almost said miasma--hung over all the other\r\nsalons, notably those of the Princesse de Lieven, Madame Thiers, and\r\nMadame de Girardin, and even those of Madame Le Hon and Victor Hugo were\r\nnot free from it. Men like myself, and especially young men, who\r\ninstinctively guessed the hollowness of all this--who, moreover, had not\r\nthe genius to become political leaders and not sufficient enthusiasm to\r\nbecome followers--avoided them; consequently their description will find\r\nlittle or no place in these notes. The little I saw of Princesse de\r\nLieven at the Tuileries and elsewhere produced no wish to see more.\r\nThiers was more interesting from a social and artistic point of view,\r\nbut it was only on very rare occasions that he consented to doff his\r\npolitical armour, albeit that he did not wear the latter with unchanging\r\ndignity. Madame Thiers was an uninteresting woman, and only the \"feeder\"\r\nto her husband, to use a theatrical phrase. Madame Le Hon was\r\nexceedingly beautiful, exceedingly selfish, and, if anything, too\r\namiable. The absence of all serious mental qualities was cleverly\r\ndisguised by the mask of a grande dame; but I doubt whether it was\r\nanything else but a mask. Madame Delphine de Girardin, on the other\r\nhand, was endowed with uncommon literary, poetical, and intellectual\r\ngifts; but I have always considered it doubtful whether even the Nine\r\nMuses, rolled into one, would be bearable for any length of time. As for\r\nVictor Hugo, no man not blessed with an extraordinary bump of veneration\r\nwould have gone more than once to his soirées. The permanent\r\nentertainment there consisted of a modern version of the \"perpetual\r\nadoration,\" and of nothing else, because, to judge by my few\r\nexperiences, his guests were never offered anything to eat or to drink.\r\nAs a set-off, the furniture and appointments of his apartments were more\r\nartistic than those of most of his contemporaries; but Becky Sharp has\r\nleft it on record that \"mouton aux navets,\" dished up in priceless china\r\nand crested silver, is after all but \"mouton aux navets,\" and at Hugo's\r\neven that homely fare was wanting.\r\n\r\nAmong the few really good salons were those of the ambassadors of the\r\nTwo Sicilies, of England, and of Austria. The former two were in the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Honoré, the latter in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. The\r\nsoirées of the Duc de Serra-Cabriola were very animated; there was a\r\ngreat deal of dancing. I cannot say the same of those of Lord and Lady\r\nGranville, albeit that both the host and hostess did the honours with\r\ncharming and truly patrician grace and hospitality. But the English\r\nguests would not throw off their habitual reserve, and the French in the\r\nend imitated the manner of the latter, in deference, probably, to Lord\r\nand Lady Granville, who were not at all pleased at this sincerest form\r\nof French flattery of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nThere was no such restraint at Count Apponyi's, in the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain, the only house where the old French noblesse mustered in\r\nforce. The latter virtually felt themselves on their own ground, for the\r\nhost was known to have not much sympathy with parvenus, even titled\r\nones, though the titles had been gained on the battle-field. Had he not\r\nduring the preceding reign ruthlessly stripped Soult and Marmont, and\r\nhalf a dozen other dukes of the first empire, by giving instructions to\r\nhis servants to announce them by their family names? Consequently,\r\nflirtation à la Marivaux, courtly _galanterie_ à la Louis XV., sprightly\r\nand witty conversation, \"minuetting\" à la Watteau, was the order of the\r\nday as well as of the night there, for the déjeûner dansant was a\r\nfrequent feature of the entertainment. No one was afraid of being\r\nmistaken for a financier anobli; the only one admitted on a footing of\r\nintimacy bore the simple name of Hope.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it must not be thought that the entertainments, even at\r\nthe three embassies, partook of anything like the splendour so\r\nnoticeable during the second empire. The refreshments elsewhere partook\r\nof a simple character; ices and cake, and lukewarm but by no means\r\nstrong tea, formed the staple of them. Of course there were exceptions,\r\nsuch as, for instance, at the above-named houses, and at Mrs. Tudor's,\r\nMrs. Locke's, and at Countess Lamoyloff's; but the era of flowing rivers\r\nof champagne, snacks that were like banquets, and banquets that were not\r\nunlike orgies, had not as yet dawned. And, worse than all, in a great\r\nmany salons the era of mahogany and Utrecht velvet was in full swing,\r\nwhile the era of white-and-gold walls, which were frequently neither\r\nwhite nor gold, was dying a very lingering death.\r\n\r\nThe Hôtel Castellane was a welcome exception to this, and politics were\r\nrigorously tabooed, the reading of long-winded poems was interdicted.\r\nPoliticians were simply reminded that the adjacent Élysée-Bourbon, or\r\neven the Hôtel Pontalba, might still contain sufficiently lively ghosts\r\nto discuss such all-important matters with them;[12] poets who fancied\r\nthey had something to say worth hearing, were invited to have it said\r\nfor them from behind the footlights by rival companies of amateurs, each\r\nof which in many respects need not have feared comparison with the\r\nprofessional one of the Comédie-Française. Amateur theatricals were,\r\ntherefore, the principal feature of the entertainments at the Hôtel\r\nCastellane; but there were \"off nights\" to the full as brilliant as the\r\nothers. There was neither acting nor dancing on such occasions, the\r\nlatter amusement being rarely indulged in, except at the grand balls\r\nwhich often followed one another in rapid succession.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 12: The Élysée-Bourbon, which was the official\r\n         residence of Louis-Napoléon during his presidency of the second\r\n         republic, was almost untenanted during the reign of\r\n         Louis-Philippe.\r\n\r\n         The Hôtel Pontalba was partly built on the site of the former\r\n         mansion of M. de Morfontaine, a staunch royalist, who,\r\n         curiously enough, had married the daughter of Le Peletier de\r\n         Saint-Fargeau, the member of the Convention who had voted the\r\n         death of Louis XVI., and who himself fell by the hand of an\r\n         assassin. Mdlle. le Peletier Saint-Fargeau was called \"La Fille\r\n         de la Nation.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nI have said rival companies, but only the two permanent ones came under\r\nthat denomination; the others were what we should term \"scratch\r\ncompanies,\" got together for one or two performances of a special work,\r\ngenerally a musical one, as in the case of Flotow's \"Rob Roy\" and\r\n\"Alice.\" They vied in talent with the regular troupes presided over\r\nrespectively by Madame Sophie Gay, the mother of Madame Émile de\r\nGirardin, and the Duchesse d'Abrantès. Each confined itself to the\r\ninterpretation of the works of its manageress, who on such evening did\r\nthe honours, or of those whom the manageress favoured with her\r\nprotection. The heavens might fall rather than that an actor or actress\r\nof Madame Gay's company should act with Madame d'Abrantès, and _vice\r\nversâ_. Seeing that neither manageress had introduced the system of\r\n\"under-studies,\" disappointments were frequent, for unless a member of\r\nthe Comédie-Française could be found to take up the part at a moment's\r\nnotice, the performance had necessarily to be postponed, the amateurs\r\nrefusing to act with any but the best. Such pretensions may at the first\r\nblush seem exaggerated; they were justified in this instance, the\r\namateurs being acknowledged to be the equals of the professionals by\r\nevery unbiassed critic. In fact, several ladies among the amateurs\r\n\"took eventually to the stage,\" notably Mdlles. Davenay and Mdlle. de\r\nLagrange. The latter became a very bright star in the operatic\r\nfirmament, though she was hidden in the musical world at large by her\r\npermanent stay in Russia. St. Petersburg has ever been a formidable\r\ncompetitor of Paris for securing the best histrionic and lyrical talent.\r\nMadame Arnould-Plessy, Bressant, Dupuis, and later on M. Worms, deserted\r\ntheir native scenes for the more remunerative, though perhaps really\r\nless artistic, triumphs of the theatre Saint-Michel; and when they\r\nreturned, the delicate bloom that had made their art so delightful was\r\nvirtually gone. \"C'était de l'art Français à la sauce Tartare,\" said\r\nsome one who was no mean judge.\r\n\r\nThe Comte Jules de Castellane, though fully equal, and in many respects\r\nsuperior, in birth to those who professed to sneer at the younger branch\r\nof the Bourbons, declined to be guided by these opponents of the new\r\ndynasty in their social crusade against the adherents to the latter;\r\nconsequently the company was perhaps not always so select as it might\r\nhave been, and many amusing incidents and _piquantes_ adventures were\r\nthe result. He put a stop to these, however, when he discovered that his\r\nhospitality was being abused, and that invitations given to strangers,\r\nat the request of some of his familiars, had been paid for in kind, if\r\nnot in coin.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, though, the company was far less addicted to\r\nscandal-mongering and causing scandal than similarly composed \"sets\"\r\nduring the subsequent reign. They were not averse to playing practical\r\njokes, especially upon those who made themselves somewhat too\r\nconspicuous by their eccentricities. Lord Brougham, who was an assiduous\r\nguest at the Hôtel Castellane during his frequent visits to Paris, was\r\noften selected as their victim. He, as it were, provoked the tricks\r\nplayed upon him by his would-be Don-Juanesque behaviour, and by the many\r\nopportunities he lost of holding his tongue--in French. He absolutely\r\nmurdered the language of Molière. His worthy successor in that respect\r\nwas Lady Normanby, who, as some one said, \"not only murdered the tongue,\r\nbut tortured it besides.\" The latter, however, never lost her dignity\r\namidst the most mirth-compelling blunders on her part, while the English\r\nstatesman was often very near enacting the buffoon, and was once almost\r\ninduced to accept a rôle in a vaudeville, in which his execrable French\r\nwould no doubt have been highly diverting to the audience, but would\r\nscarcely have been in keeping with the position he occupied on the other\r\nside of the Channel. \"Quant à Lord Brougham,\" said a very witty\r\nFrenchman, quoting Shakespeare in French, \"il n'y a pour lui qu'un pas\r\nentre le sublime et le ridicule. C'est le pas de Calais, et il le\r\ntraverse trop souvent.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1842, when the Comte Jules de Castellane married Mdlle. de\r\nVillontroys, whose mother had married General Rapp and been divorced\r\nfrom him, a certain change came over the spirit of the house; the\r\nentertainments were as brilliant as ever, but the two rival manageresses\r\nhad to abdicate their sway, and the social status of the guests was\r\nsubjected to a severer test. The new dispensation did not ostracize the\r\npurely artistic element, but, as the comtesse tersely put it,\r\n\"dorénavant, je ne recevrai que ceux qui ont de l'art ou des armoiries.\"\r\nShe strictly kept her word, even during the first years of the Second\r\nEmpire, when pedigrees were a ticklish thing to inquire into.\r\n\r\nI have unwittingly drifted away from M. de Saint-Georges, who, to say\r\nthe least, was a curious figure in artistic and literary Paris during\r\nthe reigns of Louis-Philippe and his successor. He was quite as fertile\r\nas Scribe, and many of his plots are as ingeniously conceived and worked\r\nout as the latter's, but he suffered both in reputation and purse from\r\nthe restless activity and pushing character of the librettist of \"Robert\r\nle Diable.\" Like those of Rivarol,[13] M. Saint-Georges' claims to be of\r\nnoble descent were somewhat contested, albeit that, unlike the\r\neighteenth-century pamphleteer, he never obtruded them; but there could\r\nbe no doubt about his being a gentleman. He was utterly different in\r\nevery respect from his rival. Scribe was not only eaten up with vanity,\r\nbut grasping to a degree; he had dramatic instinct, but not the least\r\nvestige of literary refinement. M. de Saint-Georges, on the contrary,\r\nwas exceedingly modest, very indifferent to money matters, charitable\r\nand obliging in a quiet way, and though perhaps not inferior in\r\nstagecraft, very elegant in his diction. When he liked, he could write\r\nverses and dialogue which often reminded one of Molière. It was not the\r\nonly trait he had in common with the great playwright. Molière is said\r\nto have consulted his housekeeper, Laforêt, with regard to his\r\nproductions; M. de Saint-Georges was known to do the same--with this\r\ndifference, however, that he did not always attend to Marguerite's\r\nsuggestions, in which case Marguerite grew wroth, especially if the\r\npiece turned out to be a success, in spite of her predictions of\r\nfailure. On such occasions the popular approval scarcely compensated M.\r\nde Saint-Georges for his discomforts at home; for though Marguerite was\r\nan admirable manager at all times--when she liked, though there was no\r\nbachelor more carefully looked after than the author of \"La Fille du\r\nRégiment,\" he had now and then to bear the brunt of Marguerite's temper\r\nwhen the public's verdict did not agree with hers.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 13: One of the great wits of the\r\n         Revolution.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIf under such circumstances M. de Saint-Georges ventured to give a\r\ndinner, the viands were sure to be cold, the Bordeaux iced, and the\r\nchampagne lukewarm. M. de Saint-Georges, who, notwithstanding his\r\ncourtly manners, was candour itself, never failed to state the reasons\r\nof his discomfiture as a host to his guests. \"Que voulez vous, mes amis,\r\nla pièce n'a pas plu à Marguerite et le dîner s'en ressent. Si je lui\r\nfaisais une observation, elle me répondrait comme elle m'a répondu déjà\r\nmaintes fois. Le dîner était mauvais, vous dîtes? C'est possible, il\r\nétait assez bien pour ceux qui ont eu le bon goût d'applaudir votre\r\npièce hier-au-soir.\" Because Mdlle. Marguerite had a seat in the upper\r\nboxes reserved for her at all the first representations of her master's\r\npieces. She did not always avail herself of the privilege at the Opéra,\r\nbut she never missed a first night at the Opéra-Comique. I have quoted\r\ntextually the words of M. de Saint-Georges on the morrow of the\r\n_première_ of \"Giselle,\" a ballet in two acts, written in collaboration\r\nwith Théophile Gautier. \"'Giselle' had been a great success; Marguerite\r\nhad predicted a failure; hence we had a remarkably bad dinner.\"\r\n\r\nI had had many opportunities of seeing Marguerite, and often wondered at\r\nthe secret of the tyranny she exercised. She was not handsome--scarcely\r\ncomely; she was not even as smart in her appearance as dozens of\r\nservants I have seen, and her mental attainments, as far as I could\r\njudge, were not above those of her own class. One can understand a\r\nTurner, a Jean Jacques Rousseau, submitting to the influence of such a\r\nlow-born companion, because, after all, they, though men of genius,\r\nsprang from the people, and may have felt awkward, ill at ease, in the\r\nsociety of well-bred men and women, especially of women. Béranger\r\nsometimes gave me that idea. But, as I have already said, no one could\r\nmistake M. de Saint-Georges for anything but a well-bred man.\r\nNotwithstanding his little affectations, his inordinate love of scents,\r\nhis somewhat effeminate surroundings, good breeding was patent at every\r\nsentence, at every movement. He was not a genius, certainly not, but the\r\nabove remarks hold good of a man who _was_ a genius, and who sprang,\r\nmoreover, from the higher bourgeoisie of the eighteenth century--I am\r\nalluding to Eugène Delacroix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     The Boulevards in the forties -- The Chinese Baths -- A favourite\r\n     tobacconist of Alfred de Musset -- The price of cigars -- The\r\n     diligence still the usual mode of travelling -- Provincials in\r\n     Paris -- Parliamentary see-saw between M.

But the\r\nCrédit Lyonnais and other palatial buildings which have been erected\r\nsince were not as much as dreamt of; if I remember rightly, the site of\r\nthat bank was occupied by two or three \"Chinese Baths.\" I suppose the\r\nprocess of steaming and cleansing the human body was something analogous\r\nto that practised in our Turkish baths, but I am unable to say from\r\nexperience, having never been inside, and, curious to relate, most of my\r\nfamiliars were in a similar state of ignorance. We rarely crossed to\r\nthat side of the boulevard except to go and dine at the Café Anglais. At\r\nthe corner of the Rue Lafitte, opposite the Maison d'Or, was our\r\nfavourite tobacconist's, and the cigars we used to get there were vastly\r\nsuperior to those we get at present in Paris at five times the cost. The\r\nassistant who served us was a splendid creature. Alfred de Musset became\r\nso enamoured of her that at one time his familiars apprehended an\r\n\"imprudence on his part.\" Of course, they were afraid he would marry\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIn those days most of our journeys in the interior of France had still\r\nto be made by the mails of Lafitte-Caillard, and the people these\r\nconveyances brought up from the provinces were almost as great objects\r\nof curiosity to us as we must have been to them. It was the third lustre\r\nof Louis-Philippe's reign. \"God,\" according to the coinage, \"protected\r\nFrance,\" and when the Almighty seemed somewhat tired of the task, Thiers\r\nand Guizot alternately stepped in to do the safeguarding. Parliament\r\nresounded with the eloquence of orators who are almost forgotten by now,\r\nexcept by students of history; M. de Genoude was clamouring for\r\nuniversal suffrage; M. de Cormenin, under the _nom de plume_ of \"Timon,\"\r\nwas the fashionable pamphleteer; the papers indulged in vituperation\r\nagainst one another, compared to which the amenities of the rival\r\nEatanswill editors were compliments. Grocers and drapers objected to the\r\nparticipation of M. de Lamartine in the affairs of State. The _Figaro_\r\nof those days went by the title of _Corsaire-Satan_, and, though\r\nextensively read, had the greatest difficulty in making both ends meet.\r\nIn order to improve the lot of the working man, there was a gratuitous\r\ndistribution of sausages once a year on the king's fête-day. The\r\nordinary rendezvous of provincial and metropolitan actors out of an\r\nengagement was not at the Café de Suède on the Boulevard Montmartre, but\r\nunder the trees at the Palais-Royal. Frédérick Lemaître went to\r\nconfession and to mass every time he \"created\" a new rôle. The\r\nLegitimists consented to leave their aristocratic seclusion, and to\r\nbreathe the same air with the bourgeoisie and proletarians of the\r\nBoulevard du Crime, to see him play. The Government altered the title of\r\nSue and Goubeaux's drama \"Les Pontons Anglais\" into \"Les Pontons,\"\r\nshort, and made the authors change the scene from England to Spain.\r\nAlexandre Dumas chaffed Scribe, and flung his money right and left;\r\nwhile the other saved it, bought country estates, and produced as many\r\nas twenty plays a year (eight more than he had contracted for). The\r\nNational Guards went in uniform and in companies to shoot hares and\r\nrabbits on the Plaine Saint-Denis, and swaggered about on the\r\nBoulevards, ogling the women. Vidocq kept a private inquiry office in\r\nthe Passage Vivienne, and made more money by blackmailing or catching\r\nunfaithful husbands than by catching thieves. Bougival, Asnières and\r\nJoinville-le-Pont had not become riparian resorts. The plaster elephant\r\non the Place de la Bastille was crumbling to pieces. The sentimental\r\nromances of Madame Loïsa Puget proved the delight of every bourgeoise\r\nfamily, while the chorus to every popular song was \"Larifla, larifla,\r\nfla, fla, fla.\"\r\n\r\nBest of all, from the working man's point of view, was the low price of\r\nbread and wine; the latter could be had at four sous the litre in the\r\nwine-shops. He, the working man, still made excursions with his wife and\r\nchildren to the Artesian well at Grenelle; and if stranded perchance in\r\nthe Champs-Élysées, stood lost in admiration at the tiny carriage with\r\nponies to match, driven by Théophile Gautier, who had left off wearing\r\nthe crimson waistcoats wherewith in former days he hoped to annoy the\r\nbourgeois, though he ceased not to rail at him by word of mouth and with\r\nhis pen. He was not singular in that respect. Among his set, the hatred\r\nof the bourgeois was ingrained; it found constant vent in small things.\r\nNestor Roqueplan wore jackboots at home instead of slippers, because the\r\nlatter chaussure was preferred by the shopkeeper. Gavarni published the\r\nmost biting pictorial satires against him. Here is one. A\r\ndissipated-looking loafer is leaning against a lamp-post, contemptuously\r\nstaring at the spruce, trim bourgeois out for his Sunday walk with his\r\nwife. The loafer is smoking a short clay pipe, and some of the fumes of\r\nthe tobacco come between the wind and the bourgeois' respectability.\r\n\"Voyou!\" says the latter contemptuously. \"Voyou tant que vous voulez,\r\npas épicier,\" is the answer.\r\n\r\nIn those days, when M. Thiers happened to be in power, many members of\r\nthe Opposition and their journalistic champions made it a point of\r\norganizing little gatherings to the table-d'hôte kept by Mdlle. Thiers,\r\nthe sister of the Prime Minister of France. Her establishment was at the\r\nentrance of the present Rue Drouot, and a signboard informed the\r\npasser-by to that effect. There was invariably an account of these\r\nlittle gatherings in next day's papers--of course, with comments. Thiers\r\nwas known to be the most wretched shot that ever worried a gamekeeper,\r\nand yet he was very fond of blazing away. \"We asked Mdlle. Thiers,\"\r\nwrote the commentators, \"whether those delicious pheasants she gave us\r\nwere of her illustrious brother's bagging. The lady shook her head.\r\n'Non, monsieur; le Président du Conseil n'a pas l'honneur de fournir mon\r\nétablissement; à quoi bon, je peux les acheter à meilleur marché que lui\r\net au même endroit. S'il m'en envoyait, il me ferait payer un bénéfice,\r\nparcequ'il ne fait jamais rien pour rien. C'est un peu le défaut de\r\nnotre famille.'\" I have got a notion that, mercurial as was M. Thiers up\r\nto the last hour of his life, and even more so at that period, and\r\nsedate as was M. Guizot, the French liked the latter better than the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot had said, \"Enrichissez vous,\" and was known to be poor; M.\r\nThiers had scoffed at the advice, and was known to be hoarding while\r\ncompelling his sister to earn her own living. It must be remembered that\r\nat the time the gangrene of greed had not entered the souls of all\r\nclasses of Frenchmen so deeply as it has now, that the race for wealth\r\nhad as yet comparatively few votaries, and that not every stockjobber\r\nand speculator aspired to emulate the vast financial transactions of the\r\nRothschilds. The latter lived, in those days, in the Rue Lafitte, where\r\nthey had three separate mansions, all of which since then have been\r\nthrown into one, and are at present exclusively devoted to business\r\npurposes. The Rue Lafitte was, however, a comparatively quiet street.\r\nThe favourite lounges, in addition to the strip of Boulevards I have\r\nalready mentioned, were the Rue Le Peletier and the galleries of the\r\nPassage de l'Opéra. Both owed the preference over the other\r\nthoroughfares to the immediate vicinity of the Opéra, which had its\r\nfrontage in the last-named street, but was by no means striking or\r\nmonumental. Its architect, Debret, had to run the gauntlet of every kind\r\nof satire for many a year after its erection; the bitterest and most\r\nscathing of all was that, perhaps, of a journalist, who wrote one day\r\nthat, a provincial having asked him the way to the grand opéra, he had\r\nbeen obliged to answer, \"Turn down the street, and it is the first large\r\ngateway on your right.\"\r\n\r\nBut if the building itself was unimposing, the company gathered around\r\nits entrance consisted generally of half a dozen men whose names were\r\nthen already household words in the musical world--Auber, Halévy,\r\nRossini and Meyerbeer, St. Georges, Adam. Now and then, though rarely\r\ntogether, all of these names will frequently reappear in these notes.\r\nThe chief attractions, though, of the Rue Le Peletier were the famous\r\nItalian restaurant of Paolo Broggi, patronized by a great many singers,\r\nthe favourite haunt of Mario, in the beginning of his career, and\r\nl'Estaminet du Divan, which from being a very simple café indeed,\r\ndeveloped into a kind of politico-literary club under the auspices of a\r\nnumber of budding men of letters, journalists, and the like, whose\r\nmodest purses were not equal to the charges of the Café Riche and\r\nTortoni, and who had gradually driven all more prosaic customers away. I\r\nbelieve I was one of the few habitués who had no literary aspirations,\r\nwho did not cast longing looks to the inner portals of the offices of\r\nthe _National_, the bigwigs of which--Armand Marrast, Baron Dornés,\r\nGérard de Nerval, and others--sometimes made their appearance there,\r\nthough their restaurant in ordinary was the Café Hardi. The Estaminet du\r\nDivan, however, pretended to a much more literary atmosphere than the\r\nmagnificent establishment on the boulevard itself. It is a positive fact\r\nthat the waiters in the former would ask, in the most respectful way\r\nimaginable, \"Does monsieur want Sue's or Dumas' feuilleton with his\r\ncafé?\" Not once but a dozen times I have heard the proprietor draw\r\nattention to a remarkable article. Major Fraser, though he never dined\r\nthere, spent an hour or two daily in the Estaminet du Divan to read the\r\npapers. He was a great favourite with every one, though none of us knew\r\nanything about his antecedents. In spite of his English name, he was\r\ndecidedly not English, though he spoke the language. He was one of the\r\nbest-dressed men of the period, and by a well-dressed man I do not mean\r\none like Sue. He generally wore a tight-fitting, short-skirted, blue\r\nfrock coat, grey trousers, of a shape which since then we have defined\r\nas \"pegtops,\" but the fashion of which was borrowed from the Cossacks.\r\nThey are still worn by some French officers in cavalry regiments,\r\nnotably crack cavalry regiments.\r\n\r\nMajor Fraser might have fitly borrowed Piron's epitaph for himself: \"Je\r\nne suis rien, pas même Académicien.\" He was a bachelor. He never alluded\r\nto his parentage. He lived by himself, in an entresol at the corner of\r\nthe Rue Lafitte and the Boulevard des Italiens. He was always flush of\r\nmoney, though the sources of his income were a mystery to every one. He\r\ncertainly did not live by gambling, as has been suggested since; for\r\nthose who knew him best did not remember having seen him touch a card.\r\n\r\nI have always had an idea, though I can give no reason for it, that\r\nMajor Fraser was the illegitimate son of some exalted personage, and\r\nthat the solution of the mystery surrounding him might be found in the\r\nrecords of the scandals and intrigues at the courts of Charles IV. and\r\nFerdinand VII. of Spain. The foreign \"soldiers of fortune\" who rose to\r\nhigh posts, though not to the highest like Richards and O'Reilly, were\r\nnot all of Irish origin. But the man himself was so pleasant in his\r\nintercourse, so uniformly gentle and ready to oblige, that no one cared\r\nto lift a veil which he was so evidently anxious not to have disturbed.\r\nI only remember his getting out of temper once, namely, when Léon\r\nGozlan, in a comedy of his, introduced a major who had three crosses.\r\nThe first had been given to him because he had not one, the second\r\nbecause he had already one, and the third because all good things\r\nconsist of three. Then Major Fraser sent his seconds to the playwright;\r\nthe former effected a reconciliation, the more that Gozlan pledged his\r\nword that an allusion to the major was farthest from his thoughts. It\r\nafterwards leaked out that our irrepressible Alexandre Dumas had been\r\nthe involuntary cause of all the mischief. One day, while he was talking\r\nto Gozlan, one of his secretaries came in and told him that a particular\r\nbugbear of his, and a great nonentity to boot, had got the Cross of the\r\nLegion of Honour.\r\n\r\n\"Grand Dieu,\" exclaimed Gozlan, \"pourquoi lui a-t-on donné cette croix?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vous ne savez pas?\" said Alexandre, looking very wise, as if he had\r\nsome important state secret to reveal.\r\n\r\n\"Assurément, je ne le sais pas,\" quoth Gozlan, \"ni vous non plus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, par exemple, moi, je le sais.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hé bien, dites alors.\"\r\n\r\n\"On lui a donné la croix parceque il n'en avait pas.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the most childish of all tricks, but Gozlan laughed at it, and,\r\nwhen he wrote his piece, remembered it. He amplified the very small\r\njoke, and, on the first night of his play, the house went into\r\nconvulsions over it.\r\n\r\nMajor Fraser's kindness and gentleness extended to all men--except to\r\nprofessional politicians, and those, from the highest to the lowest, he\r\ndetested and despised. He rarely spoke on the subject of politics, but\r\nwhen he did every one sat listening with the raptest attention; for he\r\nwas a perfect mine of facts, which he marshalled with consummate ability\r\nin order to show that government by party was of all idiotic\r\ninstitutions the most idiotic. But his knowledge of political history\r\nwas as nothing to his familiarity with the social institutions of every\r\ncivilized country and of every period. Curiously enough, the whole of\r\nhis library in his own apartment did not exceed two or three scores of\r\nvolumes. His memory was something prodigious, and even men like Dumas\r\nand Balzac confessed themselves his inferiors in that respect. The mere\r\nmention of the most trifling subject sufficed to set it in motion, and\r\nthe listeners were treated to a \"magazine article worth fifty centimes\r\nla ligne au moins,\" as Dumas put it. But the major could never be\r\ninduced to write one. Strange to say, he often used to hint that his was\r\nno mere book-knowledge. \"Of course, it is perfectly ridiculous,\" he\r\nremarked with a strange smile, \"but every now and again I feel as if all\r\nthis did not come to me through reading, but from personal experience.\r\nAt times I become almost convinced that I lived with Nero, that I knew\r\nDante personally, and so forth.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Major Fraser died, not a single letter was found in his apartment\r\ngiving a clue to his antecedents. Merely a file of receipts, and a scrap\r\nof paper attached to one--the receipt of the funeral company for his\r\ngrave, and expenses of his burial. The memorandum gave instructions to\r\nadvertise his demise for a week in the _Journal des Débâts_, the money\r\nfor which would be found in the drawer of his dressing-table. His\r\nclothes and furniture were to be sold, and the proceeds to be given to\r\nthe Paris poor. \"I do not charge any one with this particular duty,\" the\r\ndocument went on; \"I have so many friends, every one of whom will be\r\nready to carry out my last wishes.\"\r\n\r\nAnother \"mystery,\" though far less interesting than Major Fraser, was\r\nthe Persian gentleman whom one met everywhere, at the Opéra, at the\r\nBois de Boulogne, at the concerts of the Conservatoire, etc. Though\r\ninvariably polite and smiling, he never spoke to any one. For ten years,\r\nthe occupant of the stall next to his at the Opéra had never heard him\r\nutter a syllable. He always wore a long white silk petticoat, a\r\nsplendidly embroidered coat over that, and a conical Astrakan cap. He\r\nwas always alone; and though every one knew where he lived, in the\r\nPassage de l'Opéra, no one had ever set foot in his apartment. As a\r\nmatter of course, all sorts of legends were current about him. According\r\nto some, he had occupied a high position in his own country, from which\r\nhe had voluntarily exiled himself, owing to his detestation of Eastern\r\nhabits; according to others, he was simply a dealer in Indian shawls,\r\nwho had made a fortune. A third group, the spiteful ones, maintained\r\nthat he sold dates and pastilles, and that the reason why he did not\r\nspeak was because he was dumb, though not deaf. He died during the\r\nSecond Empire, very much respected in the neighbourhood, for he had been\r\nvery charitable.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the forties the Passage de l'Opéra began to lose\r\nsome of its prestige as a lounge. The outside stockjobbers, whom the\r\npolice had driven from the Boulevards and the steps of Tortoni, migrated\r\nthither, and the galleries that had resounded with the sweet\r\nwarblings--in a very low key--of the clients of Bernard Latte, the\r\npublisher of Donizetti's operas, were made hideous and unbearable with\r\nthe jostling and bellowing of the money-spinners. Bernard Latte himself\r\nwas at last compelled to migrate.\r\n\r\nIn the house the ground-floor of which was occupied by Tortoni, and\r\nwhich was far different in aspect from what it is now, lived Louis\r\nBlanc. Toward nine in the morning he came down for his cup of café au\r\nlait. It was the first cup of coffee of the day served in the\r\nestablishment. I was never on terms of intimacy with Blanc, and least of\r\nall then, for I shared with Major Fraser a dislike to politic-mongers,\r\nand, rightly or wrongly, I have always considered the author of\r\n\"L'Histoire de Dix Ans\" as such. Though Louis Blanc was three or four\r\nand thirty then, he looked like a boy of seventeen--a fact not\r\naltogether owing to his diminutive stature, though he was one of the\r\nsmallest men, if not the smallest man, I ever saw. Of course I mean a\r\nman not absolutely a dwarf. I have been assured, however, that he was a\r\ngiant compared to Don Martinoz Garay, Duke of Altamira, and Marquis of\r\nAstorga, a Spanish statesman, who died about the early part of the\r\ntwenties. These notes do not extend beyond the fall of the Commune, and\r\nit was only after that event that I met M. Blanc once or twice in his\r\nold haunts. Hence my few recollections of him had better be jotted down\r\nhere. They are not important. The man, though but sixty, and apparently\r\nnot in bad health, looked _désillusionné_. They were, no doubt, the most\r\ntrying years to the Third Republic, but M. Blanc must have perceived\r\nwell enough that, granting all the existing difficulties, the men at the\r\nhead of affairs were not the Republicans of his dreams. He had,\r\nmoreover, suffered severe losses; all his important documents, such as\r\nthe correspondence between him and George Sand and Louis-Napoléon while\r\nthe latter was at Ham, and other equally valuable matter, had been\r\ndestroyed at the fire of the Northern Goods Station at La Villette, a\r\nfire kindled by the Communists. He was dressed almost in the fashion of\r\nthe forties, a wide-skirted, long, brown frock coat, a shirt innocent of\r\nstarch, and a broad-brimmed hat. A few years later, he founded a paper,\r\n_L'Homme-Libre_, the offices of which were in the Rue Grange-Batelière.\r\nThe concern was financed by a Polish gentleman. Blanc gave his readers\r\nto understand that he would speak out plainly about persons and things,\r\nwhether past or present; that he would advance nothing except on\r\ndocumentary proofs; but that, whether he did or not, he would not be\r\nbadgered into giving or accepting challenges in defence of his writings.\r\n\"I am, first of all, too old,\" he said; \"but if I were young again, I\r\nshould not repeat my folly of '47, when I wanted to fight with Eugène\r\nPelletan on account of a woman whose virtue, provided she had any, could\r\nmake no difference to either of us. It does not matter to me that we\r\nwere not the only preux chevaliers of that period, ready to do battle\r\nfor or against the charms of a woman whose remains had crumbled to dust\r\nby then.\"[14]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 14: M. Eugène Pelletan, the father of M. Camille\r\n         Pelletan, the editor of _La Justice_, and first lieutenant to\r\n         M. Clemenceau, having severely criticized some passages in M.\r\n         Blanc's \"Histoire de la Révolution,\" relating to\r\n         Marie-Antoinette, the author quoted a passage of Madame\r\n         Campan's \"Mémoires\" in support of his writings. The critic\r\n         refused to admit the conclusiveness of the proof, whereupon M.\r\n         Blanc appealed to the Société des Gens de Lettres, which, on\r\n         the summing up of M. Taxile Delord, gave a verdict in his\r\n         favour. M. Pelletan declined to submit to the verdict, as he\r\n         had refused to admit the jurisdiction, of the tribunal. M.\r\n         Blanc, who had at first scouted all idea of a duel, considered\r\n         himself obliged to resort to this means of obtaining\r\n         satisfaction, seeing that M. Pelletan stoutly maintained his\r\n         opinion. A meeting had been arranged when the Revolution of '48\r\n         broke out. The opponents having both gone to the\r\n         Hôtel-de-Ville, met by accident at the entrance, and fell into\r\n         one another's arms. \"Thank Heaven!\" exclaimed Thiers, when he\r\n         heard of it. \"If Pelletan had killed Blanc, I should have been\r\n         the smallest man in France.\"\r\n\r\n         M. Blanc's allusion to other \"preux chevaliers\" aimed\r\n         particularly at M. Cousin, who, having become a minister\r\n         against his will, resumed with a sigh of relief his studies\r\n         under the Second Empire. He was especially fond of the\r\n         seventeenth century, and all at once he, who had scarcely ever\r\n         noticed a pretty woman, became violently smitten with the\r\n         Duchesse de Longueville, who had been in her grave for nearly\r\n         two centuries. He positively invested her with every\r\n         perfection, moral and mental; unfortunately, he could not\r\n         invest her with a shapely bust, the evidence being too\r\n         overwhelmingly against her having been adorned that way. One\r\n         day some one showed him a portrait of the sister of the \"grand\r\n         Condé,\" in which she was amply provided with the charms the\r\n         absence of which M. Cousin regretted. He wrote a special\r\n         chapter on the subject, and was well-nigh challenging all his\r\n         contradictors.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nM. Blanc's boast that he would advance nothing except on proof positive\r\nwas not an idle one, as his contributors found out to their cost. Every\r\nafternoon, at three, he arrived at the office to read the paper in proof\r\nfrom the first line to the last. Not the slightest inaccuracy was\r\nallowed to pass. Kind as he was, his reporters' lives became a burden.\r\nOne of the latter told me a story which, though it illustrates the\r\nridiculousness of M. Blanc's scruples when carried too far, is none the\r\nless valuable. A dog had been run over on the Boulevards, and the\r\nreporter, with a hankering after the realistic method, had endeavored to\r\nreproduce onomatopoeically the sounds uttered by the animal in pain.\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure, monsieur, about your sounds?\" asked Blanc.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I am as sure as a non-scientific man can be,\" was the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"Then strike them out; one ought to be scientifically sure. By-the-by, I\r\nsee you have made use of the word 'howl' (_hurler_). Unless I am\r\nmistaken, a dog when in pain yelps (_glapit_). Please alter it.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, on going through the advertisements, he found a new\r\none relating to a cough mixture, setting forth its virtues in the most\r\nglowing terms. Immediately the advertisement canvasser was sent for, M.\r\nBlanc having refused to farm out that department to an agency, as is\r\nfrequently done in Paris, in order to retain the absolute control over\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur, I see that you have a new advertisement, and it seems to me a\r\nprofitable one; still, before inserting it, I should like to be certain\r\nthat the medicine does all it professes to do. Can you personally vouch\r\nfor its efficiency?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mon Dieu, monsieur, I believe it does all it professes to do, but you\r\ncan scarcely expect me to run the risk of bronchitis in order to test it\r\nupon myself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid that I should be so exacting and indifferent to other\r\npeople's health, but until you can bring me some one who has been cured,\r\nwe will not insert it.\"\r\n\r\nLet me come back for a moment to that sentence of Louis Blanc, about the\r\npractice of duelling, in connection with one of the most tragic affairs\r\nof that kind within my recollection. I am alluding to the\r\nDujarrier-Beauvallon duel. I have been in the habit for years, whenever\r\nan important meeting took place in France, to read every shade of\r\nEnglish opinion on the subject; and while recognizing the elevated\r\nsentiments of the writers, I have no hesitation in saying that not a\r\nsingle one knew what he was writing about. They could not grasp the fact\r\nthat for a man of social standing to refuse a challenge or to refrain\r\nfrom sending one, save under very exceptional circumstances, was\r\ntantamount to courting social death. They knew not that every door would\r\nhenceforth be closed against him; that his wife's best friends would\r\ncease to call upon her, by direction of their husbands; that his\r\nchildren at school would be shunned by their comrades; that no young man\r\nof equal position to his, were he ever so much in love with his\r\ndaughter, would ask her to become his wife, that no parents would allow\r\ntheir daughter to marry his son. That is what backing out of a duel\r\nmeant years ago; that is what it still means to-day--of course, I\r\nrepeat, with certain classes. Is it surprising, then, that with such a\r\nprospect facing him, a man should risk death rather than become a\r\npariah? Would the English leader-writer, if he be a man of worth, like\r\nto enter his club-room without a hand held out to welcome him from those\r\nwith whom he was but a few weeks ago on the most friendly footing,\r\nwithout a voice to give him the time of day? I think not; and that is\r\nwhat would happen if he were a Frenchman who neglected to ask\r\nsatisfaction for even an imaginary insult.\r\n\r\nI knew M. Dujarrier, the general manager of _La Presse_, and feel\r\nconvinced that he was not a bit more quarrelsome or eager \"to go out\"\r\nthan Louis Blanc. It is, moreover, certain that he felt his inferiority,\r\nboth as a swordsman and as a marksman, to such a practised shot and\r\nfencer as M. de Beauvallon; and well he might, seeing that subsequent\r\nevidence proved that he, Dujarrier, had never handled either weapon. Yet\r\nhe not only strenuously opposed all attempts on the part of his friends\r\nto effect a reconciliation, but would not afford a hint to his adversary\r\nof his want of skill, lest the latter should make him a present of his\r\nlife. The present would not have been worth accepting. It would have\r\nbeen a Nessus-shirt, and caused the moral death of the recipient.\r\nConsequently, Dujarrier literally went like a lamb to the slaughter\r\nrather than be branded as a coward, and he made no secret of his\r\ncontemplated sacrifice. \"I have no alternative but to fight,\" he said,\r\ntwo days before the meeting, to Alexandre Dumas, who taxed all his own\r\ningenuity, and that of his son, to prevent, at any rate, a fatal issue.\r\nThe only way to effect this, according to the very logical reasoning of\r\nthe two Dumases, was to induce Dujarrier, who, as the offended party,\r\nhad the choice of weapons, to choose the sword. They counted upon the\r\ngenerosity of Beauvallon, who, as a gentleman, on discovering his\r\nadversary's utter lack of skill, would disarm, or inflict a slight wound\r\non him. Unfortunately, young Dumas, with the best intentions,\r\nunburthened himself to that effect among those most interested in the\r\naffair, namely, the staffs of _La Presse_ and _Le Globe_. These two\r\njournals were literally at daggers drawn, and some writers connected\r\nwith the latter went hinting, if not saying openly, that Dujarrier was\r\nalready showing the white feather. Whether Dujarrier heard of the\r\ncomments in that shape, or whether he instinctively guessed what they\r\nwould be, has never been clearly made out, but it is certain that from\r\nthat moment he insisted upon the use of pistols. \"I do not intend my\r\nadversary to show me the slightest favour, either by disarming me or by\r\nwounding me in the arm or leg. I mean to have a serious encounter,\" he\r\nsaid. Young Dumas, frightened perhaps at his want of reticence in the\r\nmatter, begged his father to go and see Grisier,[15] and claim his\r\nintervention. Alexandre Dumas, than whom no stauncher friend ever\r\nexisted who would have willingly risked his own life to save that of\r\nDujarrier, had to decline the mission suggested by his son. \"I cannot do\r\nit,\" he said; \"the first and foremost thing is to safeguard Dujarrier's\r\nreputation, which is the more precious because it is his first duel.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 15: The great fencing-master, whom Dumas immortalized\r\n         in his \"Maître d'Armes.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"His first duel,\"--here is the key-note to the whole of the proceedings\r\nas far as Dujarrier and his personal friends were concerned. Had\r\nDujarrier been in the position of the editor of his paper, Émile de\r\nGirardin,--had he been out before and killed or severely wounded his\r\nman, as the latter killed Armand Carrel nine years before,--he might\r\nhave openly announced his determination \"never to go out again\" under no\r\nmatter what provocation. Unfortunately, Dujarrier was not in that\r\nposition; in fact, it is no exaggeration to say that Dujarrier paid the\r\npenalty of M. de Girardin's decision. A great deal of mawkish sentiment\r\nhas been wasted upon the tragic fate of Armand Carrel; in reality, he\r\nhad what he deserved, albeit that no one more than M. de Girardin\r\nhimself regretted his untimely end. Most writers will tell one that\r\nCarrel fell a victim to his political opinions; nothing is farther from\r\nthe truth. Armand Carrel fell a victim to a \"question of shop\" of which\r\nhe allowed himself, though perhaps not deliberately, to become the\r\nchampion. After many attempts, more or less successful, in the way of\r\npopular journalism, M. de Girardin, in 1836, started _La Presse_, a\r\nserious journal of the same size as the then existing ones, but at half\r\nthe subscription of the latter, all of which absolutely banded at once\r\nagainst him. Armand Carrel, who was a soldier, and a valiant soldier, a\r\nwriter of talent, and a gentleman to boot, ought to have stood aloof\r\nfrom that kind of polemics. Émile de Girardin was not the likely man to\r\nsubmit to open or implied insult. His best, albeit his least-known book,\r\n\"Émile,\" which is as it were an autobiography, had given the measure of\r\nhis thoughts on the subject of duelling. \"Émile\" goes into society as a\r\nsoldier would go into an enemy's country. Not that he is by nature cruel\r\nor bloodthirsty, but he knows that, to hold his own, he must be always\r\nready, not only for defence, but for attack.\r\n\r\n\"The secret one is bound to preserve with regard to the preparations for\r\na meeting, and those preparations themselves are simply horrible. The\r\ncare, the precautions to be taken, the secret which is not to leak out,\r\nall these are very like the preparations for a crime,\" he says.\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" he goes on, \"the horror of all this disappears, when the\r\nman, impelled by hatred or resentment, is thirsting for revenge; but\r\nwhen the heart is absolutely without gall, and when the imagination is\r\nstill subject to all the softer emotions, then, in order not to recoil\r\nwith fear at the ever horrible idea of a duel, a man must be imbued with\r\nall the force of a prejudice which resists the very laws that condemn\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nIt was under the latter circumstances that M. de Girardin confronted his\r\nadversary. The two men had probably never exchanged a word with one\r\nanother, they felt no personal animosity; nay, more, the duel was not an\r\n_inevitable_ one; and yet it cost one man his life, and burthened the\r\nother with lifelong regrets.\r\n\r\nHad the issue been different, _La Presse_ would probably have\r\ndisappeared, and all recrimination ceased. As it was, unable to goad M.\r\nde Girardin into a reversal of his decision \"never to go out again,\" and\r\nthat in spite of nine years of direct insult from a so-called political\r\nparty, of every kind of quasi-legal vexation, M. de Beauvallon\r\nconstituted himself a second Armand Carrel, selecting Dujarrier as his\r\nvictim, the chief not being available. But here all resemblance to\r\nArmand Carrel ceased, and the law itself was anxious to mark the\r\ndifference. In the one case it had been set at nought by two men of\r\nundoubted courage and undoubted honour, meeting upon equal terms; in the\r\nother, it was proved that, not content with Dujarrier's well-known\r\ninferiority, De Beauvallon's pistols had been tried before the\r\nencounter. The court could take no cognizance of this, but it marked its\r\ndisapproval by sentencing Beauvallon to eight years', and one of his\r\nseconds, M. d'Ecquevilley, to ten years' imprisonment for perjury. Both\r\nhad declared on oath that the pistols had not been tried. The Dujarrier\r\nduel caused a deep and painful sensation. I have dwelt upon it at\r\ngreater length than was absolutely necessary, because it inspired me\r\nwith a resolution from which I have never departed since. I was\r\ntwenty-seven at the time, and, owing to circumstances which I need not\r\nrelate here, foresaw that the greater part of my life would be spent in\r\nFrance. I am neither more courageous nor more cowardly than most\r\npersons, but I objected to be shot down like a mad dog on the most\r\nfutile pretext because some one happened to have a grudge against me. To\r\nhave declined \"to go out\" on the score of my nationality would not have\r\nmet the case in the conditions in which I was living, so from that\r\nmoment I became an assiduous client at Gosset's shooting-gallery, and\r\ntook fencing lessons of Grisier. I do not know that I became very\r\nformidable with either weapon, only sufficiently skilled not to be\r\naltogether defenceless. I took care at the same time to let it go forth\r\nthat a duel to me not only meant one or both parties so severely wounded\r\nas not to be able to continue the struggle, but the resumption of the\r\ncombat, when he or they had recovered, until one was killed. Of course,\r\nit implied that I would only go out for a sufficiently weighty reason,\r\nbut that, if compelled to do so for a trifling one, I would still adhere\r\nto my original resolution. Only once, more than twelve years afterwards,\r\nI had a quarrel fastened upon me, arising out of the excitement\r\nconsequent upon the attempt of Orsini. I was the offended party, and, as\r\nsuch, could dictate the conditions of the meeting. I declined to modify\r\nin the least the rules I had laid down for my own guidance, and stated\r\nas much to those who were to act for me--General Fleury and Alexandre\r\nDumas. My adversary's friends refused to accept the terms. I was never\r\nmolested afterwards, though an Englishman had not always a pleasant life\r\nof it, even under the Second Empire.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Dujarrier's duel, I may say a few words here of that\r\nquasi-wonderful woman, Lola Montès. I say \"quasi,\" because really there\r\nwas nothing wonderful about her, except perhaps her beauty and her\r\nconsummate impudence. She had not a scrap of talent of any kind;\r\neducation she had none, for, whether she spoke in English, French, or\r\nSpanish, grammatical errors abounded, and her expressions were always\r\nthose of a pretentious housemaid, unless they were those of an excited\r\nfishwife. She told me that she had been at a boarding-school in Bath,\r\nand that she was a native of Limerick, but that when quite a child she\r\nwas taken to Seville by her parents. Her father, according to her\r\naccount, was a Spaniard, her mother a Creole. \"But I scandalized every\r\none at school, and would not learn.\" I could quite believe that; what I\r\ncould not believe was that a girl of her quick powers--for she\r\nundoubtedly possessed those--could have spent, however short a time in\r\nthe society of decent girls of her own age, let alone of presumedly\r\nrefined school-mistresses, without having acquired some elementary\r\nnotions of manner and address. Her gait and carriage were those of a\r\nduchess, for she was naturally graceful, but the moment she opened her\r\nlips, the illusion vanished--at least to me; for I am bound to admit\r\nthat men of far higher intellectual attainments than mine, and familiar\r\nwith very good society, raved and kept raving about her, though all\r\nthose defects could not have failed to strike them as they had struck\r\nme. I take it that it must have been her beauty, for, though not devoid\r\nof wit, her wit was that of the pot-house, which would not have been\r\ntolerated in the smoking-room of a club in the small hours.\r\n\r\nWhen Dujarrier was carried home dying to the Rue Lafitte, a woman flung\r\nherself on the body and covered his face with kisses. That woman was\r\nLola Montès. In his will he left her eighteen shares in the Palais-Royal\r\nTheatre, amounting in value to about 20,000 francs. She insisted\r\nafterwards in appearing as a witness at the trial in Rouen, although her\r\nevidence threw not the slightest light upon the matter. She wanted to\r\ncreate a sensation; and she accomplished her aim. I was there, and\r\nthough the court was crowded with men occupying the foremost ranks in\r\nliterature, art, and Paris society, no one attracted the attention she\r\ndid. Even the sober president and assessors sat staring at her\r\nopen-mouthed when she took her stand behind the little rail which does\r\nduty for a witness-box in France. She was dressed in mourning--not the\r\ndeepest, but soft masses of silk and lace--and when she lifted her veil\r\nand took off her glove to take the prescribed oath, a murmur of\r\nadmiration ran through the court. That is why she had undertaken the\r\njourney to Rouen, and verily she had her reward.\r\n\r\nIt was on that occasion that I became acquainted, though quite by\r\naccident, with the young man who, ten or eleven years later, was to leap\r\ninto fame all of a sudden with one novel. I have already said that the\r\ncourt was very crowded, and next to me was standing a tall, strapping\r\nfellow, somewhat younger than myself, whom, at the first glance, one\r\nwould have taken to be an English country gentleman or well-to-do\r\nfarmer's son. Such mistakes are easily made in Normandy. When Lola\r\nMontès came forward to give her evidence, some one on the other side of\r\nhim remarked that she looked like the heroine of a novel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied; \"but the heroines of the real novels enacted in\r\neveryday life do not always look like that.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned to me, having seen me speak to several people from Paris\r\nand in company of Alexandre Dumas and Berryer, whom everybody knew. He\r\nasked me some particulars about Lola Montès, which I gave him. I found\r\nhim exceedingly well-informed. We chatted for a while. When he left he\r\nhanded me his card, and hoped that we should see one another again. The\r\ncard bore the simple superscription of \"Gustave Flaubert.\" I was told\r\nduring the evening that he was the son of a local physician of note.\r\nTwelve years later the whole of France rang with his name. He had\r\nwritten \"Madame Bovary,\" and laid the foundation of what subsequently\r\nbecame the ultra-realistic school of French fiction.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to Lola Montès. The trial was really the\r\nstarting-point of her notoriety, for, in spite of her beauty, she had\r\nbeen at one time reduced to sing in the streets in Brussels. That was\r\nafter she had fled from Calcutta, whither her first husband, a captain\r\nor lieutenant James, in the service of the East India Company, had taken\r\nher. She landed at Southampton, and, during her journey to London,\r\nmanaged to ingratiate herself with an English nobleman, by pretending\r\nthat she was the wife a Spanish soldier who had been shot by the\r\nCarlists. She told me all this herself, because she was not in the least\r\nreticent about her scheming, especially after her scheming had failed.\r\nShe would, however, not divulge the name of her travelling companion,\r\nwho tried to befriend her by introducing her to some of his\r\nacquaintances, with the view of obtaining singing lessons for her. \"But\r\nI did not make my expenses, because you English are so very moral and my\r\npatron was suspected of not giving himself all that trouble for nothing.\r\nBesides, they managed to ferret out that I was not the widow of a\r\nSpanish officer, but the wife of an English one; and then, as you may\r\nimagine, it was all up. I got, however, an engagement at the Opera House\r\nin the ballet, but not for long; of course, I could not dance much, but\r\nI could dance as well as half your wooden ugly women that were there.\r\nBut they told tales about me, and the manager dismissed me.\"[16]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 16: The English nobleman must have been Lord\r\n         Malmesbury, who alludes to her as follows: \"This was a most\r\n         remarkable woman, and may be said by her conduct at Munich to\r\n         have set fire to the magazine of revolution, which was ready to\r\n         burst forth all over Europe, and which made the year 1848\r\n         memorable. I made her acquaintance by accident, as I was going\r\n         up to London from Heron Court, in the railway. The Consul at\r\n         Southampton asked me to take charge of a Spanish lady who had\r\n         been recommended to his care, and who had just landed. I\r\n         consented to do this, and was introduced by him to a remarkably\r\n         handsome person, who was in deep mourning, and who appeared to\r\n         be in great distress. As we were alone in the carriage, she, of\r\n         her own accord, informed me, in bad English, that she was the\r\n         widow of Don Diego Leon, who had lately been shot by the\r\n         Carlists after he was taken prisoner, and that she was going to\r\n         London to sell some Spanish property that she possessed, and\r\n         give lessons in singing, as she was very poor. On arriving in\r\n         London she took some lodgings, and came to my house to a little\r\n         concert which I gave, and sang some Spanish ballads. Her accent\r\n         was foreign, and she had all the appearance of being what she\r\n         pretended to be. She sold different things, such as veils,\r\n         etc., to the party present, and received a good deal of\r\n         patronage. Eventually she took an engagement for the ballet at\r\n         the Opera House, but her dancing was very inferior. At last she\r\n         was recognized as an impostor, her real name being Mrs. James,\r\n         and Irish by extraction, and had married an officer in India.\r\n         Her engagement at the Opéra was cancelled, she left the\r\n         country, and retired to Munich. She was a very violent woman,\r\n         and actually struck one of the Bavarian generals as he was\r\n         reviewing the troops. The king became perfectly infatuated with\r\n         her beauty and cleverness, and gave her large sums of money,\r\n         with a title, which she afterwards bore when she returned to\r\n         England.\" (\"Memoirs of an Ex-minister,\" by the Earl of\r\n         Malmesbury.)\r\n\r\n         Lord Malmesbury is wrong in nearly every particular which he\r\n         has got from hearsay. Lola Montès did not retire to Munich\r\n         after her engagement at the Opera House had been cancelled, but\r\n         to Brussels, and from there to Warsaw. Nor did she play the\r\n         all-important part in the Bavarian riots or revolution he\r\n         ascribes to her. The author of these notes has most of the\r\n         particulars of Lola Montès' career previous to her appearance\r\n         in Munich from her own lips, and, as he has already said, she\r\n         was not in the least reticent about her scheming, especially\r\n         when her scheming had failed. For the story of the events at\r\n         Munich, I gather inferentially from his notes that he is\r\n         indebted to Karl von Abel, King Ludwig's ultramontane minister,\r\n         who came afterwards to Paris, and who, if I mistake not, was\r\n         the father or the uncle of Herr von Abel, the Berlin\r\n         correspondent of the _Times_, some fourteen or fifteen years\r\n         ago.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nShe fostered no illusions with regard to her choregraphic talents; in\r\nfact, she fostered no illusions about anything, and her candour was the\r\nbest trait in her character. She had failed as a dancer in Warsaw,\r\nwhither she had gone from London, by way of Brussels. In the Belgian\r\ncapital, according to her own story, she had been obliged to sing in the\r\nstreets to keep from starvation. I asked her why she had not come from\r\nLondon to Paris, \"where for a woman of her attractions, and not hampered\r\nby many scruples,\" as I pointed out to her, \"there were many more\r\nresources than elsewhere.\" The answer was so characteristic of the\r\ndaring adventuress, who, notwithstanding her impecuniosity, flew at the\r\nhighest game to be had, that I transcribe it in full. I am often\r\nreluctant to trust to my memory: in this instance I may; I remember\r\nevery word of it. This almost illiterate schemer, who probably had not\r\nthe remotest notion of geography, of history, had pretty well \"the\r\nAlmanach de Gotha\" by heart, and seemed to guess instinctively at things\r\nwhich said Almanach carefully abstained from mentioning, namely, the\r\ngood understanding or the reverse between the married royal couples of\r\nEurope, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Why did I not come to Paris!\" she replied. \"What was the good of coming\r\nto Paris where there was a king, bourgeois to his finger-nails,\r\ntight-fisted besides, and notoriously the most moral and best father all\r\nthe world over; with princes who were nearly as much married as their\r\ndad, and with those who were single far away? What was the good of\r\ncoming to a town where you could not bear the title of 'la maîtresse du\r\nprince' without the risk of being taken to the frontier between two\r\ngendarmes, where you could not have squeezed a thousand louis out of any\r\nof the royal sons for the life of you? What was the good of trying to\r\nget a count, where the wife of a grocer or a shoemaker might have\r\nobjected to your presence at a ball, on the ground of your being an\r\nimmoral person? No, I really meant to make my way to the Hague. I had\r\nheard that William II. whacked his wife like any drunken labourer, so\r\nthat his sons had to interfere every now and then. I had heard this in\r\nCalcutta, and from folk who were likely to know. But as I thought that I\r\nmight have the succession of the whacks, as well as of the lord, I\r\nwanted to try my chance at Brussels first; besides, I hadn't much\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\n\"But King Leopold is married, and lives very happily with his wife,\" I\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he does--they all do,\" was the answer; \"mais ça n'empêche pas\r\nles sentiments, does it?\" I am very ignorant, and haven't a bit of\r\nmemory, but I once heard a story about a Danish or Swedish king--I do\r\nnot know the difference--who married an adventuress like myself, though\r\nthe queen and the mother of his heir was alive. He committed bigamy, but\r\nkings and queens may do things we mayn't. One day, he and his lawful\r\nwife were at one of their country seats, and, leaning out of the window,\r\nwhen a carriage passed with a good-looking woman in it, 'Who is this\r\nlady?' asked the queen. 'That's my wife,' replied the king. 'Your wife!\r\nwhat am I, then?' said the queen. 'You? well, you are my queen.'[17]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 17: Lola Montès was perfectly correct. It was\r\n         Frederick IV. of Denmark, only the woman was not an adventuress\r\n         like herself, but the Countess Reventlow, whom he had\r\n         abducted.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, whatever my intentions on Leopold's money or affections may\r\nhave been, they came to nothing; for before I could get as much as a\r\npeep at him, my money had all been spent, and I was obliged to part\r\nwith my clothes first, and then to sing in the streets to get food. I\r\nwas taken from Brussels to Warsaw by a man whom I believe to be a\r\nGerman. He spoke many languages, but he was not very well off himself.\r\nHowever, he was very kind, and, when we got to Warsaw, managed to get me\r\nan engagement at the Opéra. After two or three days, the director told\r\nme that I couldn't dance a bit. I stared him full in the face, and asked\r\nhim whether he thought that, if I could dance, I would have come to such\r\na hole as his theatre. Thereupon he laughed, and said I was a clever\r\ngirl for all that, and that he would keep me on for ornament. I didn't\r\ngive him the chance for long. I left after about two months, with a\r\nPolish gentleman, who brought me to Paris. The moment I get a nice round\r\nlump sum of money, I am going to carry out my original plan; that is,\r\ntrying to hook a prince. I am sick of being told that I can't dance.\r\nThey told me so in London, they told me in Warsaw, they told me at the\r\nPorte Saint-Martin where they hissed me. I don't think the men, if left\r\nto themselves, would hiss me; their wives and their daughters put them\r\nup to it: a woman like myself spoils their trade of honest women. I am\r\nonly waiting my chance here; for though you are all very nice and\r\ngenerous and all that kind of thing, it is not what I want.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after this conversation, the death of Dujarrier and his legacy\r\nto her gave her the chance she had been looking for. She left for\r\nLondon, I heard, with an Englishman; but I never saw him, so I cannot\r\nsay for certain. But, it appears, she did not stay long, because, a\r\nlittle while after, several Parisians, on their return from Germany,\r\nreported that they had met her at Wiesbaden, at Homburg, and elsewhere,\r\npunting in a small way, not settling down anywhere, and almost\r\ndeliberately avoiding both Frenchmen and Englishmen. The rumour went\r\nthat her husband was on her track, and that her anxiety to avoid him had\r\ncaused her to leave London hurriedly. In spite of her chequered career,\r\nin spite of the shortcomings at Brussels, Lola Montès was by no means\r\nanxious for the \"sweet yoke of domesticity.\" In another six months, her\r\nname was almost forgotten by all of us, except by Alexandre Dumas, who\r\nnow and then alluded to her. Though far from superstitious, Dumas, who\r\nhad been as much smitten with her as most of her admirers, avowed that\r\nhe was glad she had disappeared. \"She has 'the evil eye,'\" he said;\r\n\"and sure to bring bad luck to any one who closely links his destiny\r\nwith hers, for however short a time. You see what has occurred to\r\nDujarrier. If ever she is heard of again, it will be in connection with\r\nsome terrible calamity that has befallen a lover of hers.\" We all\r\nlaughed at him, except Dr. Véron, who could have given odds to Solomon\r\nEagle himself at prophesying. Fortunately he was generally afraid to\r\nopen his lips, for he was thoroughly sincere in his belief that he could\r\nprevent the event by not predicting it--at any rate aloud. For once in a\r\nway, however, Alexandre Dumas proved correct. When we did hear again of\r\nLola Montès, it was in connection with the disturbances that had broken\r\nout at Munich, and the abdication of her royal lover, Louis I. of\r\nBavaria, in favour of his eldest son, Maximilian.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the following notes relating to said disturbances was\r\ncommunicated to me by a political personage who played a not\r\ninconsiderable part in the events themselves. As a rule it is not very\r\nsafe to take interested evidence of that kind, \"but in this instance,\"\r\nas my informant put it, \"there was really no political reputation to\r\npreserve, as far as he was concerned.\" Lola Montès had simply tried to\r\noverthrow him as Madame Dubarry overthrew the Duc de Choiseul, because\r\nhe would not become her creature; and she had kept on repeating the\r\ntactics with every succeeding ministry, even that of her own making. But\r\nit should be remembered that revolution was in the air in the year '48,\r\nand that if Lola Montès had been the most retiring of favourites, or\r\nLouis I. the most moral of kings, the uprising would have happened just\r\nthe same, though the upshot might have been different with regard to\r\nLouis himself.\r\n\r\nHere is a portrait of him, which, in my literary ignorance, I think\r\nsufficiently interesting to reproduce.\r\n\r\n\"Louis was a chip of the old Wittelsbach block; that is, a Lovelace,\r\nwith a touch of the _minnesinger_ about him. Age had not damped his\r\nardour; for, though he was sixty-one when Lola Montès took up her\r\nquarters at Munich, any and every 'beauty' that came to him was sure of\r\nan enthusiastic welcome. And Heaven alone knows how many had come to him\r\nduring his reign; they seemed really directed to him from every quarter\r\nof the globe. The new arrival had her portrait painted almost\r\nimmediately; it was added to the collection for which a special gallery\r\nhad been set apart, and whither Louis went to meditate by himself at\r\nleast once a day. He averred that he went thither for poetic\r\ninspiration, for he took himself au sérieux as a poet, and, above all,\r\nas a classical poet modelling his verse upon those of ancient times. He\r\nhad published a volume of poems, entitled 'Walhalla's Genossen';[18] but\r\nhis principal study of antiquity was mainly confined to the rites\r\nconnected with the worship of Venus. He was very good-natured and\r\npleasant in his dealings with every one; he had not an ounce of gall in\r\nthe whole of his body. He was, moreover, very religious in his own way,\r\nand consequently the tool of the Jesuits, who really governed the\r\nkingdom, but who endeavoured to make his own life sweet and pleasant to\r\nhim. They liked him to take part in the religious processions, as any\r\nburgher of devout tendencies might, but being aware of his tendency to\r\nbe attracted by the first pretty face he caught sight of, they took care\r\nto relegate all the handsome maidens and matrons to the first and second\r\nfloors. In that way Louis's eyes were always lifted heavenwards, and\r\nreligious appearances were preserved.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 18: \"Companions in Walhalla.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"Under such conditions, it was not difficult for a woman of Lola Montès'\r\nattractions and daring to gain her ends. She was not altogether without\r\nmeans when she came to Munich, though the sum in her possession was far\r\nfrom a hundred thousand francs, as she afterwards alleged it was. At any\r\nrate, she was not the penniless adventuress she had formerly been, and\r\nwhen, in her beautiful dresses, she applied to the director of the\r\nHof-Theatre for an engagement, the latter was fairly dazzled, and\r\ngranted her request without a murmur. She did, however, not want to\r\ndance, and, before her first appearance, she managed to set tongues\r\nwagging about her beauty, and, as a matter of course, the rumours\r\nreached the king's ears. I am afraid I shall have to prefer a grave\r\ncharge, but I am not doing so without foundation. It is almost certain\r\nby now that the Jesuits, seeing in her a tool for the further\r\nsubjugation of the superannuated royal troubadour, countenanced, if they\r\ndid not assist her in her schemes; they, the Jesuits, did many things of\r\nwhich a Catholic, like myself, however firm in his allegiance to Rome,\r\ncould not but disapprove. At any rate, three or four days after the\r\nking's first meeting with her, Lola Montès was presented at court, and\r\nintroduced to the royal family and corps diplomatique by the sovereign\r\nhimself, as 'his best friend.' Events proceeded apace. In August, '47,\r\nthe king granted her patents of 'special naturalization,' created her\r\nBaroness von Rosenthal, and, almost immediately afterwards, Countess von\r\nLandsfeld. She received an annuity of twenty thousand florins, and had a\r\nmagnificent mansion built for her. At the instance of the king, the\r\nqueen was compelled to confer the order of St. Thérèse upon her. I, and\r\nmany others, had strenuously opposed all this, though not unaware that,\r\nup till then, the Jesuits were on her side, rather than on ours. We paid\r\nthe penalty of our opposition with our dismissal from office, and then\r\nLola Montès confronted the Jesuits by herself. She was absolutely mad to\r\ninvade Wurtemberg, not for any political reason; she could no more have\r\naccounted for any such than the merest hind, but simply because, a few\r\nmonths before her appearance at Munich, she had been, in her opinion,\r\nslighted by the old king. The fact was, old William, sincerely attached\r\nto Amalia Stubenrauch, the actress, had not fallen a victim to Lola\r\nMontès' charms, and had taken little or no notice of her. The\r\ncontemplated invasion of Wurtemberg was an act of private revenge. But\r\nmad as she was, there was some one more mad still--King Louis I. of\r\nBavaria.\r\n\r\n\"The most ill-advised thing she did, perhaps, was to change her\r\nsupporters. Like the ignorant, overbearing woman she was, she would not\r\nconsent to share her power over the king with the Jesuits; she tried to\r\nform an opposition against them among the students at the University,\r\nand she succeeded to a certain extent. These adherents constituted the\r\nnucleus of a corps which soon became known under the title of\r\n'Allemanen.' But the more noble-minded and patriotic youths at the\r\nMunich University virtually ostracized the latter, and several minor\r\ndisturbances had already broken out in consequence of this, when, in the\r\nbeginning of February, '48, a more than usually serious manifestation\r\nagainst 'Lola's creatures,' as they were called, took place. The woman\r\ndid not lack pluck, and she insisted upon defying the rioters by\r\nherself. But they proved too much for her; and, after all, she was a\r\nwoman. She endeavoured to escape from their violence, but every house\r\nwas shut against her; the Swiss on guard at the Austrian Embassy refused\r\nher shelter. A most painful scene happened; the king himself, the moment\r\nthe news reached him, rushed to her rescue, and, having elbowed his way\r\nthrough the threatening, yelling crowd, offered her his arm, and\r\nconducted her to the church of the Theatines, hard by. As a matter of\r\ncourse, several officers had joined him, and all might have been well,\r\nif she had taken the lesson to heart. But her violent, domineering,\r\nvindictive temper got the better of her. No sooner did she find herself\r\nin comparative safety, than, emboldened by the presence of the officers,\r\nshe snatched a pistol from one of them, and, armed with it, leapt out of\r\nthe building, confronting the crowd, and threatening to fire. Heaven\r\nalone knows what would have been the result of this mad act, but for the\r\ntimely arrival of a squadron of cuirassiers, who covered her retreat.\r\n\r\n\"The excitement might have died out in a week or a fortnight, though the\r\nyear '48 was scarcely a propitious one for a display of such\r\nquasi-feudal defiance, if she had merely been content to forego the\r\nrevenge for the insults she herself had provoked; but on the 10th of\r\nFebruary she prevailed upon the king to issue a decree, closing the\r\nUniversity for a twelvemonth. The smouldering fire of resentment against\r\nher constant interference in the affairs of the country blazed forth\r\nonce more, and this time with greater violence than ever. The working\r\nmen, nay, the commercial middle classes, hitherto indifferent to the\r\nking's vagaries, which, after all, brought grist to their mill, espoused\r\nthe students' cause. Barricades were erected; the cry was not 'Long live\r\nthe Constitution,' or 'Long live the Republic,' but 'Down with the\r\nconcubine.' It was impossible to mistake the drift of that insurrection,\r\nbut, in order to leave no doubt about it in the sovereign's mind, a\r\ndeputation of the municipal council and one of the Upper House waited\r\nupon Louis, and insisted upon the dismissal of Lola Montès, who, in less\r\nthan an hour, left Munich, escorted by a troop of gendarmes, who,\r\nhowever, had all their work to do to prevent her from being torn to\r\npieces by the mob. Her departure was the signal for the pillaging of her\r\nmansion, at which the king looked on--as he thought--incognito. It is\r\ndifficult to determine what prompted him to commit so rash an act. Was\r\nit a feeling of relief at having got rid of her--for there was a good\r\ndeal of cynicism about that semi-philosophical, semi-mystical\r\ntroubadour--or a desire to chew the cud of his vanished happiness?\r\nWhatever may have been the reason, he paid dearly for it, for some one\r\nsmashed a looking-glass over his head, and he was carried back to the\r\npalace, unconscious, and bleeding profusely. It was never ascertained\r\nwho inflicted the wounds, though there is no doubt that the assailant\r\nknew his victim. Meanwhile Lola Montès had succeeded in slipping away\r\nfrom her escort, and three hours later she re-entered Munich disguised,\r\nand endeavoured to make her way to the palace. But the latter was\r\ncarefully guarded, and for the next month all her attempts in that\r\ndirection proved fruitless, though, audacious as she was, she did not\r\ndare stop for a single night in the capital itself. Besides, I do not\r\nbelieve that a single inhabitant would have given her shelter. Unlike a\r\ngood many royal favourites of the past, she had no personal adherents,\r\nno faithful servants who would have stood by her through thick and thin,\r\nbecause she never treated any one kindly in the days of her prosperity:\r\nshe could only bribe; she was incapable of inspiring disinterested\r\naffection among those who were insensible to the spell of her marvellous\r\nbeauty.\"\r\n\r\nSo far the narrative of my informant. The rest is pretty well known by\r\neverybody. A few years later, she committed bigamy with another English\r\nofficer, named Heald, who was drowned at Lisbon about the same time that\r\nher real husband died. Alexandre Dumas was right--she brought ill-luck\r\nto those who attached themselves to her for any length of time, whether\r\nin the guise of lovers or husbands.\r\n\r\nThese notes about Lola Montès remind me of another woman whom public\r\nopinion would place in the same category, though she vastly differed in\r\ncharacter. I am alluding to Alphonsine Plessis, better known to the\r\nworld at large as \"La Dame aux Camélias.\" I frequently met her in the\r\nsociety of some of my friends between '43 and '47, the year of her\r\ndeath. Her name was as I have written it, and not Marie or Marguerite\r\nDuplessis, as has been written since.\r\n\r\nThe world at large, and especially the English, have always made very\r\nserious mistakes, both with regard to the heroine of the younger Dumas'\r\nnovel and play, and the author himself. They have taxed him with having\r\nchosen an unworthy subject, and, by idealizing it, taught a lesson of\r\nvice instead of virtue; they have taken it for granted that Alphonsine\r\nPlessis was no better than her kind. She was much better than that,\r\nthough probably not sufficiently good to take a housemaid's place and be\r\nobedient to her pastors and masters, to slave from morn till night for\r\na mere pittance, in addition to her virtue, which was ultimately to\r\nprove its own reward--the latter to consist of a home of her own, with a\r\nlot of squalling brats about her, where she would have had to slave as\r\nshe had slaved before, without the monthly pittances hitherto doled out\r\nto her. She was not sufficiently good to see her marvellously beautiful\r\nface, her matchless graceful figure set off by a cambric cap and a\r\ncalico gown, instead of having the first enhanced by the gleam of\r\npriceless jewels in her hair and the second wrapped in soft laces and\r\nvelvets and satins; but, for all that, she was not the common courtesan\r\nthe goody-goody people have thought fit to proclaim her--the common\r\ncourtesan, who, according to these goody-goody people, would have\r\ndescended to her grave forgotten, but for the misplaced enthusiasm of a\r\npoetical young man, who was himself corrupted by the atmosphere in which\r\nhe was born and lived afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe sober fact is that Dumas _fils_ did not idealize anything at all,\r\nand, least of all, Alphonsine Plessis' character. Though very young at\r\nthe time of her death, he was then already much more of a philosopher\r\nthan a poet. He had not seen half as much of Alphonsine Duplessis during\r\nher life as is commonly supposed, and the first idea of the novel was\r\nprobably suggested to him, not by his acquaintance with her, but by the\r\nsensation her death caused among the Paris public, the female part of\r\nwhich--almost without distinction--went to look at her apartment, to\r\nappraise her jewels and dresses, etc. \"They would probably like to have\r\nhad them on the same terms,\" said a terrible cynic. The remark must have\r\nstruck young Dumas, in whose hearing it was said, or who, at any rate,\r\nhad it reported to him; for if we carefully look at _all_ his earlier\r\nplays, we find the spirit of that remark largely pervading them.\r\n\r\nAlphonsine Plessis had probably learned even less in her girlhood than\r\nLola Montès, but she had a natural tact, and an instinctive refinement\r\nwhich no education could have enhanced. She never made grammatical\r\nmistakes, no coarse expression ever passed her lips. Lola Montès could\r\nnot make friends; Alphonsine Plessis could not make enemies. She never\r\nbecame riotous like the other, not even boisterous; for amidst the most\r\nanimated scenes she was haunted by the sure knowledge that she would die\r\nyoung, and life, but for that knowledge, would have been very sweet to\r\nher. Amidst these scenes, she would often sit and chat to me: she liked\r\nme, because I never paid her many compliments, although I was but six\r\nyears older than the most courted woman of her time. The story of her\r\nbeing provided for by a foreign nobleman because she was so like his\r\ndeceased daughter, was not a piece of fiction on Dumas' part; it was a\r\npositive fact. Alphonsine Plessis, after this provision was made for\r\nher, might have led the most retired existence; she might, like so many\r\ndemi-mondaines have done since, bought herself a country-house,\r\nre-entered \"the paths of respectability,\" have had a pew in the parish\r\nchurch, been in constant communication with the vicar, prolonged her\r\nlife by several years, and died in the odour of sanctity: but,\r\nnotwithstanding her desperate desire to live, her very nature revolted\r\nat such self-exile. When Alexandre Dumas read the \"Dame aux Camélias\" to\r\nhis father, the latter wept like a baby, but his tears did not drown the\r\ncritical faculty. \"At the beginning of the third act,\" he said\r\nafterwards, \"I was wondering how Alexandre would get his Marguerite back\r\nto town without lowering her in the estimation of the spectator.\r\nBecause, if such a woman as he depicted was to remain true to nature--to\r\nher nature--and consequently able to stand the test of psychological\r\nanalysis, she could not have borne more than two or three months of such\r\nretirement. This does not mean that she would have severed her\r\nconnection with Armand Duval, but he would have become 'un plat dans le\r\nmenu' after a little while, nothing more. The way Alexandre got out of\r\nthe difficulty proves that he is my son every inch of him, and that, at\r\nthe very outset of his career, he is a better dramatist than I am ever\r\nlikely to be. But depend upon it, that if, in real life and with such a\r\nwoman, le père Duval had not interfered, la belle Marguerite would have\r\ntaken the 'key of the street' on some pretext--and that, notwithstanding\r\nthe sale of her carriages, the pledging of her diamonds and her furs--in\r\norder not to worry the man she loved, for the time being, with money\r\nmatters. Honestly speaking, it wanted my son's cleverness to make a\r\npiece out of Alphonsine Plessis' life. True, he was fortunate in that\r\nshe died, which left him free to ascribe that death to any cause but the\r\nright one, namely, consumption. I know that he made use of it, but he\r\ntook care to show the malady aggravated by Armand Duval's desertion of\r\nher, and this is the only liberty he took with the psychological,\r\nconsequently scientific and logical, development of the play. People\r\nhave compared his Marguerite Gautier to Manon Lescaut, to Marion\r\nDelorme, and so forth: it just shows what they know about it. They might\r\njust as well compare Thiers to Cromwell. Manon Lescaut, Marion Delorme,\r\nCromwell, knew what they wanted: Marguerite Gautier and Thiers do not;\r\nboth are always in search of _l'inconnu_, the one in experimental\r\npolitics, the other in experimental love-making. Still, my son has been\r\ntrue to Nature; but he has taken an episode showing her at her best. He\r\nwas not bound to let the public know that the frequent recurrence of\r\nthese love episodes, but always with a different partner, constitutes a\r\ndisease which is as well known to specialists as the disease of\r\ndrunkenness, and for which it is impossible to find a cure. Messalina,\r\nCatherine II., and thousands of women have suffered from it. When they\r\nhappen to be born in such exalted stations as these two, they buy men;\r\nwhen they happen to be born in a lowly station and are attractive, they\r\nsell themselves; when they are ugly and repulsive they sink to the\r\nlowest depths of degradation, or end in the padded cells of a madhouse,\r\nwhere no man dares come near them. Nine times out of ten the malady is\r\nhereditary, and I am certain that if we could trace the genealogy of\r\nAlphonsine Plessis, we should find the taint either on the father's side\r\nor on the mother's, probably on the former's, but more probably still on\r\nboth.\"[19]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 19: The following is virtually a summary of an\r\n         article by Count G. de Contades, in a French bibliographical\r\n         periodical, _Le Livre_ (Dec. 10, 1885), and shows how near\r\n         Alexandre Dumas was to the truth. I have given it at great\r\n         length. My excuse for so doing is the extraordinary popularity\r\n         of Dumas' play with all classes of playgoers. As a consequence,\r\n         there is not a single modern play, with the exception of those\r\n         of Shakespeare, the genesis of which has been so much commented\r\n         upon. It is no exaggeration to say that most educated\r\n         playgoers, not to mention professional students of the drama,\r\n         have at some time or other expressed a wish to know something\r\n         more of the real Marguerite Gautier's parentage and antecedents\r\n         than is shown by Dumas, either in his play or in his novel, or\r\n         than what they could gather from the partly apocryphal details\r\n         given by her contemporaries. Dumas himself, in his preface to\r\n         the play, says that she was a farm servant. He probably knew no\r\n         more than that, nor did Alphonsine Plessis herself. In\r\n         after-years, the eminent dramatist had neither the time nor the\r\n         inclination to search musty parish registers; Count de Contades\r\n         has done so for him. Here are the results, as briefly as\r\n         possible, of his researches. Alphonsine Plessis' paternal\r\n         grandmother, \"moitié mendiante et moitié prostituée,\"\r\n         inhabited, a little less than a century ago, the small parish\r\n         of Longé-sur-Maire, which has since become simply Longé in the\r\n         canton of Briouze, arrondissement of Argentan (about thirty\r\n         miles from Alençon). She had been nicknamed \"La Guénuchetonne,\"\r\n         a rustic version of the archaic French word _guénippe_\r\n         (slattern). Louis Descours, a kind of country clod who had\r\n         entered the priesthood without the least vocation, and just\r\n         because his people wished him to do so, becomes enamoured of\r\n         \"La Guénuchetonne,\" and early in January, 1790, the curé\r\n         Philippe christens a male child, which is registered as Marin\r\n         Plessis, mother Louis-Renée Plessis, father unknown. That the\r\n         father was known well enough is proved by the Christian name\r\n         bestowed upon the babe, Marin, which was that of Louis\r\n         Descours' father. This gallant adventure of the country priest\r\n         was an open secret for miles around.\r\n\r\n         Marin Plessis grew into a handsome fellow, and when about\r\n         twenty took to travelling in the adjacent provinces of lower\r\n         and upper Normandy with a pack of small wares. Handsome and\r\n         amiable besides, he was a welcome guest everywhere, and soon\r\n         became a great favourite with the female part of the Normandy\r\n         peasantry. For a little while he flitted from one rustic beauty\r\n         to another, until he was fairly caught by one more handsome\r\n         than the rest, Marie Deshayes. She was not, perhaps,\r\n         immaculately virtuous, but, apart from her extraordinary\r\n         personal attractions, she was something more than an ordinary\r\n         peasant girl.\r\n\r\n         Some sixty years before Marin Plessis' union with Marie\r\n         Deshayes, there lived in the neighbourhood of Evreux a spinster\r\n         lady of good descent, though not very well provided with\r\n         worldly goods. She was comely and sweet-tempered enough, but\r\n         then, as now, comeliness and a sweet temper do not count for\r\n         much in the French matrimonial market, and least of all in the\r\n         provincial one. Owing to the modesty of her marriage portion,\r\n         she had no suitors for her hand, and, being of an exceedingly\r\n         amorous disposition, she bestowed her affection where she\r\n         could, \"without regret, and without false shame,\" as the old\r\n         French chronicler has it.\r\n\r\n         The annals of the village--for, curiously enough, these annals\r\n         do exist, though only in manuscripts--are commendably reticent\r\n         about the exact number and names of her lovers. It would seem\r\n         that the author, a contemporary of Mdlle. Anne du Mesnil\r\n         d'Argentelles and the great-grandfather of the present\r\n         possessor of the notes, a gentleman near Bernay, was divided\r\n         between the wish of not being too hard upon his neighbour, who\r\n         was, after all, a gentle-woman, and the desire to leave a\r\n         record of a peculiar phase of the country manners of those days\r\n         to posterity. Be this as it may, Mdlle. d'Argentelles' swains,\r\n         previous to the very last one, have been doomed to anonymous\r\n         obscurity. But with the advent of Étienne Deshayes, the\r\n         annalist becomes less reticent, he is considered worthy of\r\n         being mentioned in full, perhaps as a reward for having finally\r\n         \"made an honest woman\" of his inamorata. For that is the final\r\n         upshot of the love-story between him and Mdlle. d'Argentelles,\r\n         which, in its earlier stages, bears a certain resemblance to\r\n         that between Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Madame de Warens, with\r\n         this difference--that the Normand Jean-Jacques is considerably\r\n         older than his mistress.\r\n\r\n         The children born of this marriage were very numerous. One of\r\n         them, Louis-Deshayes, married a handsome peasant girl,\r\n         Marie-Madeleine Marra, who appears to have been somewhat too\r\n         intimate with a neighbouring squire, but who gave birth a few\r\n         years after to a daughter, of whose paternity there could not\r\n         be the smallest doubt, seeing that she grew up into a speaking\r\n         likeness of her maternal grandmother, the erstwhile Mdlle. Anne\r\n         du Mesnil d'Argentelles. Fate ought to have had a better lot in\r\n         store for beautiful Marie Deshayes than a marriage with a poor\r\n         pedlar like Marin Plessis; but the latter was very handsome,\r\n         and, notwithstanding the opposition of the family, she became\r\n         his wife. On the 15th of January, 1824, the child which was to\r\n         be immortalized as \"La Dame aux Camélias\" saw the light, in a\r\n         small village in Lower Normandy.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThere were few of us who, during Alphonsine Plessis' lifetime, were so\r\ninterested in her as to have gone to the length of such a psychological\r\nanalysis of her pedigree. Nevertheless, most men were agreed that she\r\nwas no ordinary girl. Her candour about her early want of education\r\nincreased the interest. \"Twenty or twenty-five years ago,\" said Dr.\r\nVéron, one day, after Alphonsine Plessis had left the dinner table, \"a\r\nwoman of her refinement would not have been phenomenal in her position,\r\nbecause at that period the grisette, promoted to the rank of femme\r\nentretenue, had not made her appearance. The expression 'femme\r\nentretenue' was not even known. Men chose their companions, outside\r\nmarriage, from a different class; they were generally women of education\r\nand often of good family who had made a faux pas, and, as such,\r\nforfeited the society and countenance of their equals who had not\r\nstumbled in that way, at any rate not in the sight of the world. I\r\nconfess, Alphonsine Plessis interests me very much. She is, first of\r\nall, the best-dressed woman in Paris; secondly, she neither flaunts nor\r\nhides her vices; thirdly, she is not always talking or hinting about\r\nmoney; in short, she is a wonderful courtesan.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of all this admiration was very favourable to Alexandre Dumas\r\n_fils_ when he brought out his book about eighteen months after her\r\ndeath. It was in every one's hands, and the press kept whetting the\r\ncuriosity of those who had not read it as yet with personal anecdotes\r\nabout the heroine. In addition to this, the title was a very taking one,\r\nand, moreover, absolutely new; for, though it was obvious enough from\r\nAlphonsine Plessis' habit of wearing white camellias the greater part of\r\nthe year, no one had ever thought of applying it to her while she was\r\nalive; hence, the credit of its invention belongs decidedly to Dumas\r\n_fils_.\r\n\r\nI may return to the subject of \"La Dame aux Camélias\" in connection with\r\nthe play; meanwhile, I will say a few words of the only man among our\r\nset who objected to the title, \"because it injures my own,\" as he put\r\nit; namely, M. Lautour-Mézerai, who had been surnamed \"L'Homme au\r\nCaméllia;\" in the singular, from his habit of never appearing in public\r\nwithout that flower in his button-hole. And be it remembered that in\r\nthose days, the flower was much more rare than it is at present, and\r\nconsequently very expensive. The plagiarist, if there was one, must have\r\nbeen Alphonsine Plessis, for Dr. Véron, who was one of his oldest\r\nfriends, did not remember having ever seen him _minus_ the camellia, and\r\ntheir friendship dated from the year 1831. It is computed that during\r\nthe nineteen years Mézerai was in Paris, previous to his departure for\r\nthe South of France and afterwards for Algeria, in both of which\r\nprovinces he fulfilled the functions of prefect, he must have spent no\r\nless than fifty thousand francs on his favourite floral ornament, for he\r\nfrequently changed it twice a day, and its price, especially in the\r\nthirties and earlier part of the forties, was not less than five francs.\r\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that he resented the usurpation of his\r\ntitle. M. Lautour-Mézerai was one of the most elegant men I knew. He not\r\nonly belonged to a very good provincial stock, but his family on both\r\nsides counted some eminent names in literature.[20] He was a most\r\ncharming companion, exceedingly generous; but he would not have parted\r\nwith the flower in his button-hole for any consideration, not even to\r\noblige his greatest friend, male or female. It was more than an ornament\r\nto him, he looked upon it as a talisman. He always occupied the same\r\nplace at the Opéra, in the balcony, or what we call the \"dress-circle,\"\r\nand many a covetous glance from the brightest eyes was cast at the\r\ndazzling white camellia, standing out in bold relief against the dark\r\nblue coat, but neither glances nor direct requests had any effect upon\r\nhim. He became absolutely savage in his refusal when too hardly pressed,\r\nbecause, by his own admission, he was superstitious enough to believe\r\nthat, if he went home without it, something terrible would happen to him\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 20: Curiously enough, he belonged to the same\r\n         department, and died almost on the very spot where Marin\r\n         Plessis was born.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nM. Lautour-Mézerai was, however, something more than a mere man of\r\nfashion. To him belongs the credit of having founded--at any rate in\r\nFrance--the children's periodical. For the comparatively small\r\nsubscription of six francs per annum, thousands of little ones received\r\nevery month a number of the _Journal des Enfants_, stitched in blue\r\npaper, and with their own name on the wrapper. It flattered their pride\r\nto be treated like their elders by having their literature despatched to\r\nthem in that way, and there is no doubt that this ingenious device\r\ncontributed, to a certain extent, to the primary and enormous success of\r\nthe undertaking. But M. Lautour-Mézerai was too refined a littérateur to\r\ndepend upon such a mere trick, and a look at even the earlier numbers of\r\nthe _Journal des Enfants_, would prove conclusively that, in the way of\r\namusing children while instructing them a little, nothing better has\r\nbeen done since, whether in France, England, or Germany. The editor and\r\nmanager succeeded in grouping around him such men as Paul Lacroix (_le\r\nbibliophile Jacob_) and Charles Nodier, both of whom have never been\r\nsurpassed in making history attractive to young minds. Émile Souvestre,\r\nLéon Gozlan, Eugène Sue, and even Alexandre Dumas told them the most\r\nwonderful stories. The men who positively kept the adult population of\r\nFrance spellbound by their stirring romances seemed to take a delight in\r\ncompeting with women like Virginie Ancelot, the Duchesse d'Abrantès, and\r\nothers on the latter's ground. As a consequence, it became the fashion\r\nto present the young ones on New Year's Day with a receipt for a\r\ntwelvemonth's subscription, made out in their names, instead of the\r\neverlasting bag of sweets. At one time the circulation of _Le Journal\r\ndes Enfants_ was computed at 60,000, and M. Lautour-Mézerai was said to\r\nmake 100,000 francs per annum out of it.\r\n\r\nIn a former note, I incidentally mentioned Auguste Lireux. He is\r\nscarcely remembered by the present generation of Frenchmen; I doubt\r\nwhether there are a hundred students of French literature in England who\r\nknow his name, let alone his writings: yet he is worthy of being\r\nremembered by both. He had--what a great many French writers of talent,\r\nfar greater than his own, essentially lack--humour. True, the latter was\r\nnot subtle; but it was rarely, if ever, coarse. The nearest approach to\r\nhim among the journalists of the present day is M. Francisque Sarcey;\r\nbut the eminent dramatic critic has had a better education.\r\nNevertheless, if Lireux had finished as he began, he would not be so\r\nentirely forgotten. Unfortunately for his fame, if not for his material\r\nwelfare, he took it into his head to become a millionnaire, and he\r\nalmost succeeded; at any rate, he died very well off, in a beautiful\r\nvilla at Bougival.\r\n\r\nI remember meeting with Lireux almost immediately after he landed in\r\nParis, at the end of '40 or the beginning of '41. He came, I believe,\r\nfrom Rouen; though, but for his accent, he might have come from\r\nMarseilles. Tall, well-built, with brown hair and beard and ruddy\r\ncomplexion, a pair of bright eyes behind a pair of golden spectacles,\r\nvery badly dressed, though his clothes were almost new, very loud and\r\nvery restless, his broad-brimmed hat cocked on one side, he gave one the\r\nimpression of what in Paris we used to call a \"departemental oracle.\"\r\nHe was that to a certain extent, still he was not really pompous, and\r\nthe feeling of discomfort one experienced at first soon wore off. He was\r\nnot altogether unknown among the better class of journalists in the\r\ncapital, for it appears that he frequently contributed to the Paris\r\npapers from the provinces. He had a fair knowledge of the French drama\r\ntheoretically, for he had never written a piece, and openly stated his\r\nintention never to do so. But in virtue of his dramatic criticisms in\r\nseveral periodicals--which, in spite of the difference in education\r\nbetween the two men, read uncommonly like the articles of M. Sarcey in\r\nthe _Temps_--and his unwavering faith in his lucky star, he considered\r\nhimself destined not only to lift the Odéon from the slough in which it\r\nhad sunk, but to make it a formidable rival to the house in the Rue de\r\nRichelieu. He had no ambition beyond that. The Odéon was really at its\r\nlowest depth. Harel had enjoyed a subsidy of 130,000 francs, M. d'Epagny\r\neleven years later had to content himself with less than half, and yet\r\nthe authorities were fully cognizant of the necessity of a second\r\nThéâtre-Français. Whether from incapacity or ill-luck, M. d'Epagny did\r\nnot succeed in bringing back the public to the old house. The direction\r\nwas offered then to M. Hippolyte Lucas, the dramatic critic of _Le\r\nSiècle_, and one of the best English scholars I have ever met with among\r\nthe French, and, on his declining the responsibility, given to Lireux,\r\nwho for the sake of making a point, exclaimed, \"Directeur!... au refus\r\nd'Hippolyte Lucas!\"[21]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 21: An imitation of the line of Don Carlos in Hugo's\r\n         \"Hernani\": \"Empereur!... au refus de Frédéric-le-Sage!\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIt was a piece of bad taste on Lireux's part, because M. Lucas was his\r\nsuperior in every respect, though he would probably have failed where\r\nthe other succeeded--at least for a while. Save for this mania of saying\r\nsmart things in and out of season, Lireux was really a good-natured\r\nfellow, and we were all glad that he had realized his ambition. The\r\nventure looked promising enough at the start. He got an excellent\r\ncompany together, comprising Bocage, Monrose, Gil-Pères, Maubant,\r\nMdlles. Georges and Araldi, Madame Dorval, etc.; and if, like young\r\nBonaparte's troops, they were badly paid and wanted for everything, they\r\nworked with a will, because, like Bonaparte, Lireux inspired them with\r\nconfidence. He, on the other hand, knew their value, and on no pretext\r\nwould allow them to be ousted from the positions they had honourably\r\nwon by their talents and hard work. Presumptuous mediocrity, backed\r\neither by influence or intrigue, found him a stern adversary; the\r\nintriguer got his answer in such a way as to prevent him from returning\r\nto the charge. One day an actor of reputed incapacity, Machanette,\r\nclaimed the title-rôle in Molière's \"Misanthrope.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no one else to play Alceste,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have. I have got one of the checktakers,\" replied Lireux.\r\n\r\nAuguste Lireux was one of those managers the race of which began with\r\nHarel at the Porte Saint-Martin and Dr. Véron at the Opéra. Duponchel,\r\nat the latter house, Montigny at the Gymnase, Buloz and Arsène Houssaye\r\nat the Comédie-Francaise, endeavoured as far as possible to follow their\r\ntraditions of liberality towards the public and their artists, and\r\nencouragement given to untried dramatists. It was not Lireux's fault\r\nthat he did not succeed for any length of time. Of course, there is a\r\nridiculous side to everything. During the terrible cholera visitation of\r\n1832, Harel published a kind of statistics, showing that not a single\r\none of the spectators had been attacked by the plague; but all this\r\ncannot blind us to the support given to the struggling playwright,\r\nDumas, in the early part of his career. During the winter of 1841-'42,\r\nwhich was a severe one, Lireux sent foot-warmers to the rare audience\r\nthat patronized him on a bitterly cold night, \"when tragedy still\r\nfurther chills the house\"; the little bit of charlatanism cannot disturb\r\nthe fact of his having given one of the foremost dramatists of the day a\r\nchance with \"La Cigue.\" I am alluding to the first piece of Émile\r\nAugier.\r\n\r\nThis kind of thing tells with a general public, more so still with a\r\npublic composed of generous-minded, albeit somewhat riotous youths like\r\nthose of the Quartier-Latin in the early forties. Gradually the latter\r\nfound their way to the Odéon, \"sinon pour voir la pièce, alors pour\r\nentendre Lireux, qui est toujours amusant\"; which, in plain language,\r\nmeant that come what may they would endeavour to provoke Lireux into\r\ngiving them a speech.\r\n\r\nFlattering as was this resolve on their part to Lireux's eloquence, the\r\nmeans they employed to encompass their end would have made the existence\r\nof an ordinary manager a burden to him. But Lireux was not an ordinary\r\nmanager; he possessed \"the gift of the gab\" to a marvellous degree:\r\nconsequently he made it known that he would be happy at any time to\r\naddress MM. les étudiants without putting them to the expense of apples\r\nand eggs on the evening of the performance, and voice-lozenges the next\r\nday, if they, MM. les étudiants, would in return respect his furniture\r\nand the dresses of his actors. The arrangement worked exceedingly well,\r\nand for four years the management and the student part of the audience\r\nlived in the most perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nLireux did more than that, he forestalled their possible objections to a\r\ndoubtful episode in a play. I remember the first night of \"Jeanne de\r\nNaples.\" The piece had dragged fearfully. Lireux had made three\r\ndifferent speeches during the evening, but he foresaw a riot at the end\r\nof the piece which no eloquence on his part would be able to quell. It\r\nappears--for we only found this out the next day--that the condemned\r\nwoman, previous to being led to execution, had to deliver a monologue of\r\nat least a hundred and fifty or two hundred lines. The unhappy queen had\r\nscarcely begun, when a herculean soldier rushed on the stage, took her\r\ninto his arms and carried her off by main force, notwithstanding her\r\nstruggles. It was a truly sensational ending, and the curtain fell\r\namidst deafening applause. It redeemed the piece!\r\n\r\nNext day Lireux made his appearance at Tortoni's in the afternoon, and,\r\nas a matter of course, the production of the previous evening was\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot understand,\" said Roger de Beauvoir, \"how a man with such\r\nevident knowledge of stagecraft as the author displayed in that\r\ndénoûment, could have perpetrated such an enormity as the whole of the\r\nprevious acts.\"\r\n\r\nLireux was fairly convulsed with laughter. \"Do you really think that was\r\nhis own invention?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is not. His dénoûment was a speech which would have taken\r\nabout twenty minutes, at the end of which the queen is tamely led off\r\nbetween the soldiers. I know what would have been the result: the\r\nstudents would have simply torn up the benches and Heaven knows what\r\nelse. You know that if the gas is left burning, if only a moment, after\r\ntwelve, there is an extra charge irrespective of the quantity consumed.\r\nI looked at my watch when she began to speak her lines. It was exactly\r\nthirteen minutes to twelve; she might have managed to get to the end by\r\ntwelve, but it was doubtful. What was not doubtful was the row that\r\nwould have ensued, and the time it would have taken me to cope with it.\r\nMy mind was made up there and then. I selected the biggest of the\r\nsupers, told him to go and fetch her, and you know the rest.\"\r\n\r\nThere were few theatrical managers in those days who escaped the\r\nvigilance of Balzac. Among the many schemes he was for ever hatching for\r\nbenefiting mankind and making his own fortune, there was one which can\r\nnot be more fitly described than in the American term of \"making a\r\ncorner\"; only that particular \"corner\" was to be one in plays.\r\n\r\nAbout two years before the advent of Lireux, and when the house at Ville\r\nd'Avray, of which I have spoken elsewhere, was completed, a party of\r\nliterary men received an invitation to spend the Sunday there. It was\r\nnot an ordinary invitation, but a kind of circular-letter, the\r\npostscriptum to which contained the following words: \"M. de Balzac will\r\nmake an important communication.\" Léon Gozlan, Jules Sandeau, Louis\r\nDesnoyers, Henri Monnier, and those familiar with Balzac's schemes, knew\r\npretty well what to expect; and when Lassailly, one of the four men\r\nwhose nose vied with the legendary one of Bouginier, confirmed their\r\napprehensions that it was a question of making their fortunes, they\r\nresigned themselves to their fate. Jules Sandeau, who was gentleness\r\nitself, merely observed with a sigh that it was the fifteenth time\r\nBalzac had proposed to make him a millionnaire; Henri Monnier offered to\r\nsell his share of the prospective profits for 7 francs, 50 centimes;\r\nLéon Gozlan suggested that their host might have discovered a diamond\r\nmine, whereupon Balzac, who had just entered the room, declared that a\r\ndiamond mine was nothing to it. He was simply going to monopolize the\r\nwhole of the Paris theatres. He exposed the plan in a magnificent speech\r\nof two hours' duration, and would have continued for two hours more had\r\nnot one of the guests reminded him that it was time for dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Dinner,\" exclaimed Balzac; \"why, I never thought of it.\"\r\n\r\nLuckily there was a restaurant near, and the future millionnaires and\r\ntheir would-be benefactor were enabled to sit down to \"a banquet quite\r\nin keeping, not only with the magnificent prospects just disclosed to\r\nthem, but with the splendour actually surrounding them,\" as Méry\r\nexpressed it.\r\n\r\nFor it should be added that the sumptuous dwelling which was to be, was\r\nat that moment absolutely bare of furniture, save a few deal chairs and\r\ntables. The garden was a wilderness, intersected by devious paths,\r\nsloping so suddenly as to make it impossible to keep one's balance\r\nwithout the aid of an Alpenstock or the large stones imbedded in the\r\nsoil, but only temporarily, by the considerate owner. One day, Dutacq,\r\nthe publisher, having missed his footing, rolled as far as the wall\r\ninclosing the domain, without his friends being able to stop him.\r\n\r\nThe garden, like everything else connected with the schemes of Balzac,\r\nwas eventually to become a gold-mine. Part of it was to be built upon,\r\nand converted into a dairy; another part was to be devoted to the\r\nculture of the pineapple and the Malaga grape, all of which would yield\r\nan income of 30,000 francs annually \"at least\"--to borrow Balzac's own\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nThe apartments had been furnished in the same grandiose\r\nway--theoretically. The walls were, as I have already remarked,\r\nabsolutely bare, but on their plaster, scarcely dry, were magnificent\r\ninscriptions of what was to be. They were mapped out regardless of\r\nexpense. On that facing the north there was a splendid piece of\r\nthirteenth-century Flemish tapestry--in writing, of course, flanked by\r\ntwo equally priceless pictures by Raphael and Titian. Facing these,\r\none by Rembrandt, and, underneath, a couch, a couple of arm-chairs,\r\nand six ordinary ones, Louis XV., and upholstered in Aubusson\r\ntapestry--subjects, Lafontaine's Fables. Opposite again, a monumental\r\nmantelpiece in malachite (a present of Czar Nicholas, who had\r\nexpressed his admiration of Balzac's novels), with bronzes and clock\r\nby De Gouttières. The place on the ceiling was marked for a chandelier\r\nof Venetian glass, and in the dining-room a square was drawn on the\r\ncarpetless floor for the capacious sideboard, whereon would be\r\ndisplayed \"the magnificent family plate.\"\r\n\r\nPending the arrival of the furniture, the building of the dairy,\r\nhothouses, and vineries, the guests had to sit on hard wooden chairs, to\r\neat a vile dinner, supplemented, however, by an excellent dessert.\r\nBalzac was very fond of fruit, and especially of pears, of which he\r\nalways ate an enormous quantity. The wine was, as a rule, very inferior,\r\nbut on that particular occasion Balzac's guests discovered that their\r\nhost's imagination could even play him more cruel tricks in the\r\nselection of his vintages than it played him in his pursuit of financial\r\nschemes and the furnishing of his house.\r\n\r\nWhen the fruit was placed upon the table, Balzac assumed a most solemn\r\nair. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I am going to give you some Château-Lafitte,\r\nsuch as you have never tasted--such as it has been given to few mortals\r\nto taste. I wish you to sip it carefully--I might almost say reverently,\r\nbecause the opportunity may not repeat itself in our lives.\"\r\n\r\nWherewith the guests' glasses were filled; all of them made horrible\r\nfaces, for it was abominable stuff, but one more outspoken than the rest\r\ngave his opinion there and then--\r\n\r\n\"This may be 'Château de la Rue Lafitte,' but it is enough to give one\r\nthe colic.\"\r\n\r\nAny one else but Balzac would have been horribly disconcerted; he, on\r\nthe contrary, did not budge. \"Yes,\" he said proudly, \"you are right in\r\none respect; this ambrosial nectar comes in a straight line from the Rue\r\nLafitte, for it is Baron James de Rothschild who made me a present of\r\ntwo barrels, for which I am profoundly grateful. Drink, gentlemen,\r\ndrink, and be thankful also.\"\r\n\r\nThose who would consider this a clever piece of acting on Balzac's part,\r\nwould be greatly mistaken. His imagination at times affected his palate\r\nas well as his other organs, and at that moment he was under the\r\ndistinct impression that he was offering his guests one of the rarest\r\nvintages on record.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured hitherto to digress as little as possible in my\r\nrecollections, though their very nature made it difficult. In this\r\ninstance, digression was absolutely necessary to convey an idea of the\r\nshock which would naturally result from the contact of two such brains\r\nas those of Balzac and Lireux; for it was not long after the young\r\nmanager's advent to the Odéon that Balzac found his way to his sanctum.\r\nThe play he offered him was \"Les Ressources de Quinola.\" Strange as it\r\nmay seem to us, even as late as '42, Balzac's name as a novelist did not\r\nrank first in the list with the general public, still it is very\r\ndoubtful whether any young manager would have refused a stage play by\r\nhim; consequently, Lireux accepted \"Les Ressources de Quinola\" almost\r\nwithout fear. It is not to the purpose to say that it was a bad play,\r\nand that he ought to have known better; it has been amply proved by now\r\nthat the most experienced manager is not infallible; but it is a moot\r\npoint whether the greatest masterpiece would have succeeded with the\r\ntactics adopted by Balzac to insure its success. The following may\r\nappear like a scene from a farcical comedy; I can vouch for the truth of\r\nevery word of it, because I had it from the lips of Lireux himself, who,\r\nafter all, was the heaviest sufferer by Balzac's incurable greed, or, to\r\nput it as leniently as one can, by his constant chase after a capital\r\nstroke of business. His resolve to pack the house on the first night was\r\nnot due to a desire to secure a favourable reception from a friendly\r\naudience, but to the determination to secure \"a lump sum,\" let come what\r\nmight. In Balzac are found the two contradictory traits of the\r\nmoney-grubber and the spendthrift.\r\n\r\nThe scene alluded to just now, took place when the rehearsals were far\r\nadvanced; the author and the manager were discussing the invitations to\r\nbe sent out, etc. All at once Balzac declared that he would have none\r\nbut Knights of the Order of Saint-Louis in the pit. \"I am agreeable,\"\r\nreplied Lireux, \"provided you ferret them out.\"[22]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 22: It shows that Lireux was not very familiar with\r\n         the royal edicts affecting that order, and that Balzac himself\r\n         exaggerated the social and monetary importance of its wearers.\r\n         For, though Louis-Philippe at his accession suppressed the\r\n         order, not less than twelve thousand new knights had been\r\n         created by his two immediate predecessors. They, the recently\r\n         created knights, were allowed to retain their honours and\r\n         pensions; but, even before the fall of the Bourbons, the\r\n         distinction had lost much of its prestige. After the Battle of\r\n         Navarino, Admiral de Rigny, soliciting rewards for his officers\r\n         who had distinguished themselves, tacitly ignored the order of\r\n         Saint-Louis in favour of that of the Legion of Honour. The\r\n         order, as founded by Louis XIV. in 1693, was only available to\r\n         officers and Catholics. Several modifications were introduced\r\n         afterwards in its statutes. The Order of Saint-Louis and that\r\n         of \"Military Merit\" were the only two recognized by the\r\n         Constituent Assembly of 1789; but the Convention suppressed the\r\n         former, only leaving the latter.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"I'll see to that,\" said Balzac. \"Pray go on. What is the next part of\r\nthe house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Orchestra stalls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but peers of France there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the orchestra stalls will not hold them all, Monsieur de Balzac.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who cannot find room in the house will have to stand in the\r\nlobbies,\" said Balzac, imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\"Stage boxes?\" continued Lireux.\r\n\r\n\"They will be reserved for the Court.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stage boxes on the first tier?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the ambassadors and plenipotentiaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"The open boxes on the ground floor?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the wives and families of the ambassadors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upper circle?\" enumerated Lireux, not a muscle of his face moving.\r\n\r\n\"For the deputies and grand officers of State.\"\r\n\r\n\"Third circle?\" enumerated Lireux.\r\n\r\n\"The heads of the great banking and financial establishments.\"\r\n\r\n\"The galleries and amphitheatre?\"\r\n\r\n\"A carefully selected, but varied, bourgeoisie,\" wound up Balzac.\r\n\r\nLireux, who was a capital mimic, re-enacted the scene for us\r\nfour-and-twenty hours after it had been enacted in his own room, and\r\nwhile he was still under the impression that it was merely a huge joke\r\non Balzac's part. He soon discovered, however, that the latter was\r\nterribly in earnest, when, a few days later, Balzac claimed the whole of\r\nthe seats for the first three nights, on the penalty of withdrawing his\r\npiece there and then. Lireux foolishly submitted, the box office was\r\nclosed; every one applying for tickets was referred to Balzac himself,\r\nor rather to the shady individual who had egged him on to this\r\nspeculation. The latter, at the first application, had run up the\r\nprices; the public felt disgusted, and when the curtain rose upon \"Les\r\nRessources de Quinola,\" the house was almost empty. Thereupon a batch of\r\nnondescripts was sent into the streets to dispose of the tickets at any\r\nprice; the bait was indignantly rejected, and the curtain fell amidst\r\nviolent hisses. I repeat, a masterpiece would have failed under such\r\ncircumstances; but the short run of the revival, almost a quarter of a\r\ncentury later at the Vaudeville, proved that the piece was not even an\r\nordinary money-drawing one. It only kept the bills for about nine or ten\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nLireux was more fortunate with several other pieces, notably with that\r\nof Léon Gozlan, known to students of the French drama as \"La Main Droite\r\net la Main Gauche,\" but which originally bore the title of \"Il était une\r\nFois un Roi et une Reine.\" There could be no doubt about its tendency in\r\nits original form; it was nothing less than an indictment for bigamy\r\nboth against Queen Victoria and her Consort; and the authorities had to\r\ninsist not only upon the change of title and the names of the _dramatis\r\npersonæ_, but upon the action being shifted from London to Stockholm.\r\nThe author and manager had to comply; but the public, who had got wind\r\nof the affair, crowded the house every night in order to read between\r\nthe lines.\r\n\r\nOne of my great sources of amusement for many years has been the perusal\r\nof political after-dinner speeches, and political leaders in the English\r\npapers, especially when the speakers and writers have endeavoured to lay\r\nstress upon the cordial relations between the French and the English,\r\nupon the friendly feelings guiding their actions on both sides. I am\r\nputting together these notes nearly fourteen years after the conclusion\r\nof the Franco-German War, nearly three quarters of a century after\r\nWaterloo. There is not a single Frenchman, however Chauvinistic, who\r\never thinks, let alone talks, of avenging Napoléon's defeat by\r\nWellington; while, on the other hand, there is not a single Frenchman,\r\nhowever unpatriotic, who does not dream now and then of wiping out the\r\nhumiliation suffered at Sedan. Well, in spite of the almost entire\r\noblivion of the one disaster, and the poignant recollection of the\r\nother, the French of to-day hate the English more than the Germans;\r\nor--let me put it more correctly--they hate the Germans, they despise\r\nus. Nothing that we can do will ever remove this dislike of us.\r\n\r\nIt has been thus as long as I can remember; no royal visits, no exchange\r\nof so-called international courtesies will alter the feeling. It is\r\nready to burst forth, the smallest provocation or fancied one will set\r\nit ablaze. During the forties there were a good many real or imaginary\r\nprovocations on the part of England, and, as a consequence, the hostile\r\nfeeling against her broke forth where it is almost always sure to break\r\nforth first in France--on the stage and in song. After \"La Main Droite\r\net la Main Gauche,\" came Halévy's opera of \"Charles VI.\" It is but fair\r\nto say that the Government did all it could to stem the tide, but,\r\nnotwithstanding its positive orders to modify the chorus of the famous\r\nwar song in the first act, the song was henceforth regarded as a\r\npatriotic hymn. Nor did the visit of the Queen to Louis-Philippe at Eu,\r\nin 1843, effect much improvement in this state of things; and, as a\r\nmatter of course, we on the English side of the Channel retaliated the\r\nskits, etc., though I do not think we took them au grand sérieux. When,\r\nin January, '44, I went to London for a few days, I found the Christmas\r\npantomime of \"King Pippin\" in full swing at Drury Lane. I well remember\r\na scene of it, laid in the shop of a dealer in plaster figures. Two of\r\nthese represented respectively the King of France and the Queen of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland. At a given moment, the two statues became\r\nanimated, drew close to one another, and exchanged the most profuse\r\nsalutations. But meanwhile, at the back of the stage, the Gallic cock\r\nand the British lion (or leopard) assumed a threatening attitude, and at\r\neach mark of affection between the two royal personages, shook their\r\nheads violently and seemed to want desperately to come to close\r\nquarters. The audience applauded vociferously, and it was very evident\r\nto me that neither in Paris nor in London the two nations shared the\r\nentente cordiale of their rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     Rachel and some of her fellow-actors -- Rachel's true character\r\n     -- Her greediness and spitefulness -- Her vanity and her wit --\r\n     Her powers of fascination -- The cost of being fascinated by her\r\n     -- Her manner of levying toll -- Some of her victims, Comte\r\n     Duchâtel and Dr. Véron -- The story of her guitar -- A little\r\n     transaction between her and M.

Either her genius blinded them to\r\nher faults, or else they were content to perpetuate the popular belief\r\nin her amiability, good nature, generosity, etc. The fact is, that\r\nRachel off the stage was made of very ordinary clay. She had few of the\r\ngood qualities of her race, and a good many of the bad ones; she was\r\ngreedy to a degree, and could be very spiteful. All these drawbacks, in\r\nthe eyes of most of her biographers, were redeemed by her marvellous\r\ntragic abilities on the stage, by a wonderful \"gift of the gab,\" by a\r\n\"happy-go-lucky,\" \"hail-fellow, well-met\" manner off the stage to those\r\nwhom she liked to propitiate. Nevertheless, there were times when she\r\nhad not a single friend at the Comédie-Française, and though her\r\nchampions attributed this hostility to jealousy of her great gifts, a\r\nmoment's consideration would show us that such a feeling could scarcely\r\nhave influenced the men who to a great extent shared her histrionic\r\ntriumphs, viz., Beauvallet, Régnier, Provost, Samson, and least of all\r\nthe latter. Still, all these would have willingly kept her out of the\r\nComédie-Française after she had left it in a huff. She was difficult to\r\nget on with; her modesty, assumed in everyday life, was a sham, for woe\r\nto the host who, deceived by it, did not at once make her the queen of\r\nthe entertainment! And, in reality, nothing in her warranted such a\r\ntemporary elevation. She was witty in her way and after her kind--that\r\nis, she had the quick-wittedness of the French woman who is not an\r\nabsolute fool, and who has for many years rubbed elbows with everything\r\ndistinguished in art and literature. Notwithstanding this intimacy, I am\r\ndoubtful whether she had ever read, let alone appreciated, any of the\r\nmasterpieces by the writers of her own days that did not directly bear\r\nupon her profession. I exclude fiction--I mean narrative fiction, and\r\nespecially that of a sensational kind, of which she was probably as fond\r\nas the meanest concierge and most romantic milliner-girl.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, provided one did not attempt to analyze it, the power of\r\nfascinating the coldest interlocutor was there. To their honor be it\r\nsaid, her contemporaries, especially the men, rarely made such an\r\nattempt at analysis. They applauded all she said (off and on the stage),\r\nthey tolerated all she did, albeit that they paid the cost of many of\r\nher so-called \"amiable tricks,\" which were mainly so many instances of\r\ngreed and nothing else. One evening she was dining at Comte Duchâtel's,\r\nthe minister of Louis-Philippe. The table was positively laden with\r\nflowers, but Rachel did not care much about them; what she wanted was\r\nthe splendid silver centre-piece. But she was too clever to unmask her\r\nbatteries at once, so she began by admiring the contents, then at last\r\nshe came to the principal point. The host was either in one of his\r\ngenerous or foolish moods, and made her a present of it there and then.\r\nRachel knew, though, that even with a grand seigneur like Comte\r\nDuchâtel, there are \"les lendemains de l'enthousiasme,\" especially when\r\nhe is a married man, whose wife does not willingly submit to have her\r\nhome stripped of its art-treasures. The tragédienne came in a hackney\r\ncab; the comte offered to send her back in his carriage. She struck the\r\niron while it was hot. \"Yes, that will do admirably; there will be no\r\nfear of my being robbed of your present, which I had better take with\r\nme.\" \"Perfectly, mademoiselle,\" replied the comte; \"but you will send me\r\nback my carriage, won't you?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Véron was despoiled with even less ceremony. Having taken a fancy to\r\nsome silver saucers or cups in which the proprietor of the\r\n_Constitutionnel_ offered ices to his visitors, she began by pocketing\r\none, and never rested until she had the whole of the set. In short,\r\neverything was fish to her net. She made her friends give her bibelots\r\nand knickknacks of no particular value, to which she attached some\r\nparticular legend--absolute inventions for the greatest part--in order\r\nto sell them for a thousand times their original cost. One day she\r\nnoticed a guitar at the studio of one of her familiars. \"Give me that\r\nguitar; people will think it is the one with which I earned my living on\r\nthe Place Royale and on the Place de la Bastille.\" And as such it was\r\nsold by her to M. Achille Fould for a thousand louis. The great\r\nfinancier nearly fell into a fit when the truth was told to him at\r\nRachel's death; he, in his turn, having wanted to \"do a bit of\r\nbusiness.\" In this instance no Christian suffered, because buyer and\r\nvendor belonged to the same race. Of course the panegyrists of Rachel,\r\nwhen the story came to their ears, maintained that the thousand louis\r\nwere employed for some charitable purpose, without, however, revealing\r\nthe particular quarter whither they went; but those who judged Rachel\r\ndispassionately could not even aver that her charity began at home,\r\nbecause, though she never ceased complaining of her brother's and her\r\nsisters' extravagance, both brother and sisters could have told very\r\ncurious tales about the difficulty of making her loosen her\r\npurse-strings for even the smallest sums. As for Rachel's doing good by\r\nstealth and blushing to find it fame, it was all so much fudge. Contrary\r\nto the majority of her fellow-professionals, in the past as well as the\r\npresent, she even grudged her services for a concert or a performance in\r\naid of a deserving object, although she was not above swelling her own\r\nhoard by such entertainments.\r\n\r\nThe following instance, for the absolute truth of which I can vouch, is\r\na proof of what I say. One day the celebrated Baron Taylor, who had been\r\nthe director of the Comédie-Française, came to solicit her aid for a\r\ncharity concert; I am not certain of the object, but believe it was in\r\naid of the Christians in Persia or China. The tickets were to be a\r\nhundred francs each. Sontag, Alboni, Rosine Stoltz, Mario, Lablache,\r\nVieuxtemps, and I do not know how many more celebrated artists had\r\npromised their services.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1850 when M. Arsène Houssaye was her director, and I am\r\nparticular about giving the year, because Rachel refused on the pretext\r\nthat her director would never give her leave to appear on any other\r\nstage. Now, it so happened that no woman ever had a more devoted friend\r\nand chivalrous champion than Rachel had in Arsène Houssaye. His\r\nfriendship for her was simply idolatry, and I verily believe that if she\r\nhad asked him to stand on his head to please her, he would have done so,\r\nat the risk of making himself supremely ridiculous--he who feared\r\nridicule above everything, who was one of the most sensible men of his\r\ntime, who was and is the incarnation of good-nature, to whom no one in\r\ndistress or difficulties ever appealed in vain.\r\n\r\nBaron Taylor argued all this, but Rachel remained inflexible. \"I am very\r\nsorry,\" he said at last, rising to go, \"because I am positive that your\r\nname on the bill would have made a difference of several thousand francs\r\nin the receipts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you only want my name,\" was the answer, \"you may have it; you\r\ncan make an apology at the eleventh hour for my absence on the score of\r\nsudden indisposition--the public at charity concerts are used to that\r\nsort of thing; besides, you will have so many celebrities that it will\r\nmake very little difference. By-the-by\"--as he was at the door--\"I think\r\nmy name is worth ten or twenty tickets.\" Taylor knew Rachel too well to\r\nbe in the least surprised at the demand, and left ten tickets on the\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon he met Count Walewski, and as a matter of course\r\nasked him to take some tickets.\r\n\r\n\"Very sorry, cher baron, but I have got ten already. You see, poor\r\nRachel did not know very well how to get rid of the two hundred you\r\nburdened her with as a lady patroness; so she wanted me to have twenty,\r\nbut I settled the matter with ten. As it is, it cost me a thousand\r\nfrancs.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor did not say another word--he probably could not; he was struck\r\ndumb with astonishment at the quickness with which Rachel had converted\r\nthe tickets into money. But what puzzled him still more was the fact of\r\nher having offered Walewski double the quantity of tickets he had given\r\nher. Where had she got the others from? He was coming to the conclusion\r\nthat she had offered twenty in order to place ten, when he ran against\r\nComte Le Hon, the husband of the celebrated Mdlle. Musselmans, the\r\nerstwhile Belgian ambassador to the court of Louis-Philippe, who averred\r\nfrankly that he was the father of a family, though he had no children of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nTaylor thought he would try another chance, and was met with the reply,\r\n\"Cher baron, I am very sorry, but I have just taken five tickets from\r\nMdlle. Rachel. It appears that she is a lady patroness, and that they\r\nburdened her with two hundred; fortunately, she told me, people were\r\nexceedingly anxious to get them, and these were the last five.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she had two hundred tickets after all,\" said Baron Taylor to\r\nhimself, making up his mind to find out who had been before him with\r\nRachel. But no one had been before him. The five tickets sold to Comte\r\nLe Hon were five of the ten she had sold to Comte Walewski. When the\r\nlatter had paid her, she made him give her five tickets for herself and\r\nfamily, or rather for her four sisters and herself. Of Comte Le Hon she\r\nonly took toll of one, which, wonderful to relate, she did not sell.\r\nThis was Rachel's way of bestirring herself in the cause of charity.\r\n\r\n\"Look at the presents she made to every one,\" say the panegyrists. They\r\nforget to mention that an hour afterwards she regretted her generosity,\r\nand from that moment she never left off scheming how to get the thing\r\nback. Every one knew this. Beauvallet, to whom she gave a magnificent\r\nsword one day, instead of thanking her, said, \"I'll have a chain put to\r\nit, mademoiselle, so as to fasten it to the wall of my dressing-room. In\r\nthat way I shall be sure that it will not disappear during my absence.\"\r\nAlexandre Dumas the younger, to whom she made a present of a ring, bowed\r\nlow and placed it back on her finger at once. \"Allow me to present it to\r\nyou in my turn, mademoiselle, so as to prevent you asking for it.\" She\r\ndid not say nay, but carried the matter with one of her fascinating\r\nsmiles. \"It is most natural to take back what one has given, because\r\nwhat one has given was dear to us,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nBetween '46 and '53 I saw a great deal of Rachel, generally in the\r\ngreen-room of the Comédie-Française, which was by no means the\r\ncomfortable or beautiful apartment people imagine, albeit that even in\r\nthose days the Comédie had a collection of interesting pictures, busts,\r\nand statues worthy of being housed in a small museum. The chief ornament\r\nof the room was a large glass between the two windows, but if the\r\napartment had been as bare as a barn, the conversation of Rachel would\r\nhave been sufficient to make one forget all about its want of\r\ndecoration; for, with the exception of the elder Dumas, I have never met\r\nany one, either man or woman, who exercised the personal charm she did.\r\nI have been told since that Bismarck has the same gift. I was never\r\nsufficiently intimate with the great statesman to be able to judge,\r\nhaving only met him three or four times, and under conditions that did\r\nnot admit of fairly testing his powers in that respect, but I have an\r\nidea that the charm of both lay in their utter indifference to the\r\neffect produced, or else in their absolute confidence of the result of\r\ntheir simplicity of diction. Rachel's art of telling a story, if art it\r\nwas, reminded one of that of the chroniclers of the _Niebelungen_; for\r\nnotwithstanding her familiarity with Racine and Corneille, her\r\nvocabulary was exceedingly limited, and her syntax, if not her grammar,\r\noff the stage, not always free from reproach.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend, after the lapse of so many years, to give these\r\nstories in her own language, or all of them; there are a few, however,\r\nworth the telling, apart from the fascination with which she invested\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOne evening she said to me, \"Do you know Poirson?\"\r\n\r\nI had known Poirson when he was director of the Gymnase. He afterwards\r\nalways invited me to his soirées, one of which, curiously enough, was\r\ngiven on the Sunday before the Revolution of '48. So I said, \"Yes, I\r\nknow Poirson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he ever told you why he did not re-engage me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you. People said it was because I did not succeed in 'La\r\nVendéenne' of Paul Duport; but that was not the cause. It was something\r\nmuch more ridiculous; and now that I come to think of it, I am not sure\r\nthat I ought to tell you, for you are an Englishman, and you will be\r\nshocked.\"\r\n\r\nI was not shocked, I was simply convulsed with laughter, for Rachel, not\r\ncontent with telling the story, got up, and, gradually drawing to the\r\nmiddle of the room, enacted it. It was one of those ludicrous incidents\r\nthat happen sometimes on the stage, which no amount of foresight on the\r\npart of the most skilful and conscientious manager or actor can prevent,\r\nbut which almost invariably ruins the greatest masterpiece. There were\r\nabout eight or nine actors and actresses in the room--Régnier, Samson,\r\nBeauvallet, etc. It was probably the most critical audience in Europe,\r\nbut every one shook, and Mdlle. Anaïs Aubert went into a dead faint.\r\nRégnier often averred that if Rachel had been a man, she would have been\r\nthe greatest comic actor that ever lived; and it is not generally known\r\nthat she once played Dorine in \"Tartuffe,\" and set the whole of the\r\nhouse into a perfect roar; but on that evening I became convinced that\r\nRachel, in addition to her tragic gifts, was the spirit of\r\nAristophanesque comedy personified. I am afraid, however, that I cannot\r\ntell the story, or even hint at it, beyond mentioning that Poirson is\r\nreported to have said that Rachel did not want a stage-manager, but a\r\nnurse to take care of her. The criticism was a cruel one, though\r\njustified by appearances. It was Mama Félix, and not her daughter, who\r\nwas to blame. The child--she was scarcely more than that--had hurt\r\nherself severely, and instead of keeping her at home, she sent her to\r\nthe theatre, \"poulticed all over,\" as Rachel expressed it afterwards.\r\n\r\nMama Félix was the only one who was a match for her famous daughter in\r\nmoney matters. What the latter did with the enormous sums of money she\r\nearned has always been a mystery. As I have already said, they were not\r\nspent in charity. Nowadays, whatever other theatres may do, the\r\nComédie-Française dresses its pensionnaires as well as its sociétaires\r\nfrom head to foot; it pays the bootmaker's as well as the wigmaker's\r\nbill, and the laundress's also. Speaking of the beginning of her career,\r\nwhich coincided with the end of Rachel's, Madeleine Brohan, whose\r\nlanguage was often more forcible than elegant, remarked, \"Dans ma\r\njeunesse, on nous mettait toutes nues sur la scène; nous étions assez\r\njolies pour cela.\" But Rachel's costumes varied so little throughout her\r\ncareer as to have required but a small outlay on her part. Nor could her\r\nordinary dresses and furniture, which I happened to see in April, 1858,\r\nwhen they were sold by public auction at her apartments in the Place\r\nRoyale, have made a considerable inroad on her earnings. The furniture\r\nwas commonplace to a degree; such pictures and knickknacks as were of\r\nvalue had been given to her, or acquired in the manner I have already\r\ndescribed; the laces and trinkets were, undoubtedly, not purchased with\r\nher own money. It is said that her brother Raphael was a spendthrift. He\r\nmay have been, but he did not spend his celebrated sister's money; of\r\nthat I feel certain. Then what became of it? I am inclined to think that\r\nMdlle. Rachel dabbled considerably in stocks, and that, notwithstanding\r\nher shrewdness and sources of information, she was the victim of people\r\ncleverer than she was. At any rate, one thing is certain--she was nearly\r\nalways hard up; and, after having exhausted the good will of all her\r\nmale acquaintances and friends, compelled to appeal to her mother, who\r\nhad made a considerable hoard for her other four sisters, and perhaps\r\nalso for her scapegrace son; for, curiously enough, with Mama Félix\r\nevery one of her children was a goddess or god, except _the goddess_.\r\nThis want of appreciation on the mother's part reminds me of a story\r\ntold to me by Meissonier. His granddaughter, on her fifteenth or\r\nsixteenth birthday, had a very nice fan given to her. The sticks were\r\nexquisitely carved in ivory, and must have cost a pretty tidy sum, but\r\nthe fan itself, of black gauze, was absolutely plain. The donor probably\r\nintended the grandfather's art to enhance the value of the present, and\r\nthe latter was about to do so, when the young lady stopped him with the\r\ncry, \"Voilà qu'il va me gâter mon éventail avec ses mannequins!\" The\r\nirony of non-appreciation by one's nearest and dearest could no further\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nMama Félix, then, was very close-fisted, and would never lend her\r\ndaughter any money, except on very good security, namely, on her jewels.\r\nIn addition to this, she made her sign an undertaking that if not\r\nredeemed at a certain date they would be forfeited; and forfeited they\r\nwere, if the loan and interest were not forthcoming at the stipulated\r\ntime, notwithstanding the ravings of Rachel. This would probably account\r\nfor the comparatively small quantity of valuable jewelery found after\r\nher death.\r\n\r\nSome of the ornaments I have seen her wear had an artistic value utterly\r\napart from their cost, others were so commonplace and such evident\r\nimitations as to have been declined by the merest grisette. One day I\r\nnoticed round her wrist a peculiar bracelet. It was composed of a great\r\nnumber of rings, some almost priceless, others less valuable but still\r\nvery artistic, others again possessing no value whatsoever, either\r\nartistically or otherwise. I asked her to take it off and found it to be\r\nvery heavy, so heavy that I remarked upon it. \"Yes,\" she replied, \"I\r\ncannot wear two of the same weight, so I am obliged to wear the other in\r\nmy pocket.\" And out came the second, composed of nearly double the\r\nnumber of rings of the first. I was wondering where all those rings came\r\nfrom, but I refrained from asking questions. I was enabled to form my\r\nown conclusions a little while afterwards, in the following way:\r\n\r\nWhile we were still admiring the bracelet, Rachel took from her finger a\r\nplain gold hoop, in the centre of which was an imperial eagle of the\r\nsame metal. \"This was given to me by Prince Louis Napoléon,\" she said,\r\n\"on the occasion of my last journey to London. He told me that it was a\r\nsouvenir from his mother, and that he would not have parted with it to\r\nany one else but me.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot remember the exact date of this conversation, but it must have\r\nbeen shortly after the Revolution, when the future emperor had just\r\nlanded in France. About three or four weeks afterwards we were talking\r\nto Augustine Brohan, who had just returned from London, where she had\r\nfulfilled an engagement of one or two months. Rachel was not there that\r\nnight, but some one asked her if she had seen Prince Louis in London.\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied; \"he was going away, and he gave me a present before\r\nhe went.\" Thereupon she took from her finger a ring exactly like that of\r\nRachel's. \"He told me it was a souvenir from his mother, and that he\r\nwould not have parted with it to any one but me.\"\r\n\r\nWe looked at one another and smiled. The prince had evidently a jeweller\r\nwho manufactured \"souvenirs from his mother\" by the dozen, and which he,\r\nthe prince, distributed at that time, \"in remembrance of certain happy\r\nhours.\" The multiplicity of the rings on Rachel's wrist was no longer a\r\npuzzle to me. I was thinking of the story in the \"Arabian Nights,\" where\r\nthe lady with the ninety-eight rings bewitches the Sultans Shariar and\r\nShahzenan, in spite of the jealousy and watchfulness of the monster to\r\nwhom she belongs, and so makes the hundred complete.\r\n\r\nAmong the many stories Rachel told me there is one not generally\r\nknown--that of her first appearance before Nicholas I. Though she was\r\nvery enthusiastically received in London, and though she always spoke\r\ngratefully of the many acts of kindness shown her there, I am inclined\r\nto think that she felt hurt at the want of cordiality on the part of the\r\nEnglish aristocracy when they invited her to recite at their\r\nentertainments. This may be a mere surmise of mine; I have no better\r\ngrounds for it than an expression of hers one day when we were\r\ndiscussing London society. \"Oui, les Anglais, ils sont très aimables,\r\nmais ils paraissent avoir peur des artistes, comme des bêtes sauvages,\r\ncar ils vous parquent comme elles au Jardin des Plantes.\" I found out\r\nafterwards that it was a kind of grudge she bore the English for having\r\ninvariably improvised a platform or enclosure by means of silken ropes.\r\nCertain is it that, beyond a few casual remarks at long intervals upon\r\nLondon, she seemed reluctant to discuss the subject with me. Not so with\r\nregard to Potsdam after her return whence in August, '51. In the\r\nbeginning of July of that year she told me that she had a special\r\nengagement to appear before the court on the 13th of that month. I did\r\nnot see her until a few weeks after she came back, and then she gave me\r\na full account of the affair. I repeat, after the lapse of so many\r\nyears, I cannot reproduce her own words, and I could not, even half an\r\nhour after her narrative, have reproduced the manner of her telling it;\r\nbut I can vouch for the correctness of the facts.\r\n\r\n\"About six o'clock, Raphael [her brother], who was to give me my cues,\r\nand I arrived at Potsdam, where we were met by Schneider, who had made\r\nthe engagement with me. You know, perhaps, that Schneider had been an\r\nactor himself, that afterwards he had been promoted to the directorship\r\nof the Royal Opera House, and that now he is the private reader to the\r\nking, with the title of privy or aulic councillor.\r\n\r\n\"Schneider is a very nice man, and I have never heard a German speak our\r\nlanguage so perfectly. Perhaps it was as well, because I dread to\r\ncontemplate what would have been the effect upon my nerves and ears of\r\nlamentations in Teutonized French.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why lamentations?\"? I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, nous voilà!\" she replied. \"You remember I was in mourning. The\r\nmoment I stepped out of the carriage, he exclaimed, 'But you are all in\r\nblack, mademoiselle.' 'Of course I am,' I said, 'seeing that I am in\r\nmourning.' 'Great Heaven! what am I to do? Black is not admitted at\r\ncourt on such occasions.' I believe it was the birthday of the Czarina,\r\nbut of course I was not bound to know that.\r\n\r\n\"There was no time to return to Berlin, and least of all to get a dress\r\nfrom there, so Raphael and he put their heads together; the result of\r\nwhich conference was my being bundled rather than handed into a\r\ncarriage, which drove off at full speed to the Château de Glinicke. I\r\ncould scarcely catch a glimpse of the country around Potsdam, which\r\nseemed to me very lovely.\r\n\r\n\"When we got to Glinicke, which belongs to Prince Charles, I was handed\r\nover to some of the ladies-in-waiting of the princess. Handed over is\r\nthe only word, because I felt more like a prisoner than anything else,\r\nand they tried to make 'little Rachel' presentable according to their\r\nlights. One of them, after eyeing me critically, suggested my wearing a\r\ndress of hers. In length it would have done very well, only I happen to\r\nbe one of the lean kine, and she decidedly was not, so that idea had to\r\nbe abandoned. They may be very worthy women, these German ladies, but\r\ntheir inventiveness with regard to dress is absolutely _nil_. When the\r\nidea suggested by the first lady turned out to be impracticable, they\r\nwere à bout de ressources. You may gather from this, mon ami, that the\r\nbeginning and the end of their stratégie de la toilette are not far\r\napart. There was one thing that consoled me for this sudden exhaustion\r\nof their limited ingenuity. Between the half-dozen--for they were half a\r\ndozen--they could not find a single word when the first and only device\r\nproved impossible of realization. Had there been the same number of\r\nFrench women assembled, it would have been a kind of little madhouse; in\r\nthis instance there was a deep silence for at least ten minutes,\r\neventually broken by the knocking at the door of one of the maids, with\r\nHerr Schneider's compliments, and wishing to know what had been decided\r\nupon. The doleful answer brought him to the room, and what six women\r\ncould not accomplish, he, like the true artist, accomplished at once.\r\n'Get Mdlle. Rachel a black lace mantilla, put a rose in her hair, and\r\ngive her a pair of white gloves.' In less than ten minutes I was ready,\r\nand in another ten, Raphael, Schneider, and I embarked on a pretty\r\nlittle steam-yacht lying ready at the end of the magnificent garden for\r\n'l'Île des Pâons' (Pfauen-Insel, Peacock Island), where we landed\r\nexactly at eight. But my troubles and surprises were not at an end. I\r\nmade sure that there would be at least a tent, an awning, or a platform\r\nfor me to stand under or upon. Ah, oui! not the smallest sign of either.\r\n'Voilà votre estrade,' said Schneider, pointing to a small lawn,\r\nseparated from the rest of the gardens by a gravelled walk three or four\r\nfeet wide. I declined at once to act under such conditions, and insisted\r\nupon being taken back immediately to the station, and from thence to\r\nBerlin. Poor Schneider was simply in despair. In vain did he point out\r\nthat to any one else the total absence of scenery and adjuncts might\r\nprove a drawback, but that to me it would only be an additional\r\nadvantage, as it would bring into greater relief my own talent; I would\r\nnot be persuaded. Finding that it was fruitless to play upon my vanity\r\nas an artist, he appealed to me as a femme du monde. 'The very absence\r\nof all preparations,' he said, 'proves that their majesties have not\r\nengaged Mdlle. Rachel of the Comédie-Française to give a recitation, but\r\ninvited Mdlle. Rachel Félix to one of their soirées. That Mdlle. Rachel\r\nFélix should be kind enough, after having partaken of a cup of tea, to\r\nrecite something, would only be another proof of her well-known\r\nreadiness to oblige;' and so forth. Let me tell you, mon cher, that I\r\nhave rarely met with a cleverer diplomatist, and Heaven knows I have\r\nseen a lot who imagined themselves clever. They could not hold a candle\r\nto this erstwhile actor; nevertheless I remained as firm as a rock,\r\nthough I was sincerely distressed on Schneider's account.\"\r\n\r\n\"What made you give in at last?\" I inquired. \"Was it the idea of losing\r\nthe magnificent fee?\"\r\n\r\n\"For once you are mistaken,\" she laughed, \"though Schneider himself\r\nbrought that argument to bear as a big piece of artillery. 'Remember\r\nthis, mademoiselle,' he said, when he could think of nothing else;\r\n'remember this--that this soirée may be the means of putting three\r\nhundred thousand or four hundred thousand francs into your pocket. You\r\nyourself told me just now on board the yacht that you were very anxious\r\nfor an engagement at St. Petersburg. I need scarcely tell you that, if\r\nyou refuse to appear before their majesties to-night, I shall be\r\ncompelled to state the reason, and Russia will be for ever closed to\r\nyou. Apart from pecuniary considerations, it will be said by your\r\nenemies--and your very eminence in your profession causes you to have\r\nmany--that you have failed to please the Empress. After all, the fact\r\nthat all the ordinary surroundings of the actress have been neglected\r\nproves that you are not looked upon as an actress by them, but as une\r\nfemme du monde.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That persuaded you?\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you would think so, even if I swore the contrary a hundred\r\ntimes over; but if you were to guess from now till to-morrow, you would\r\nnever hit upon the real reason that made me stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I had better not try, and you had better tell me at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange as it may seem to you, it was neither the gratification of\r\nbeing treated en femme du monde nor the money that made me stay; it was\r\nthe desire to see what I had been told was the handsomest man in Europe.\r\nI did see him, and for once in a way rumour had not exaggerated the\r\nreality. I had scarcely given my final consent to Schneider, when the\r\nyacht carrying the imperial and royal families came alongside the\r\nisland, and the illustrious passengers landed, amidst an avalanche of\r\nflowers thrown from the other vessels. Schneider presented me to the\r\nKing, who was also good-looking, and the latter presented me to the\r\nCzar.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately afterwards the recital began. At the risk of taxing your\r\ncredulity still further, I may tell you that I, Rachel, who never knew\r\nwhat 'stage-fright' meant, felt nervous. That man to me looked like a\r\nvery god. Fortunately for my reputation, the shadows of night were\r\ngathering fast; in another twenty minutes it would be quite dark, and I\r\nfelt almost rejoiced that my audience could scarcely distinguish my\r\nfeatures. On the other hand, Raphael, who only knew the part of\r\nHippolyte by heart, and who was obliged to read the others, declared\r\nthat he could not see a line, and candles had to be brought in. It was a\r\nglorious evening, but there was a breeze nevertheless, and as fast as\r\nthe candles were lighted, they were extinguished by the wind. To put\r\nordinary lamps on the lawn at our feet was not to be thought of for a\r\nmoment; luckily one of the functionaries remembered that there were some\r\ncandelabra with globes inside, and by means of these a kind of 'float'\r\nwas improvised. Still the scene was a curious one. Raphael close to me\r\non the edge of the lawn, with one of these candelabra in his left hand.\r\nBehind, to the left and right of us, a serried crowd of generals, court\r\ndignitaries in magnificent uniforms. In front, and separated by the\r\nwhole width of a gravel walk, the whole group of sovereigns and their\r\nrelations, and behind them the walls of the mansion, against which the\r\ntea-table had been set, and around which stood the ladies-in-waiting of\r\nthe Queen of Prussia and the Empress of Russia. A deep silence around,\r\nonly broken by the soft soughing of the wind in the trees, and the\r\nsplashing of a couple of fountains near, playing a dirge-like\r\naccompaniment to Raphael's and my voice.\r\n\r\n\"The recital lasted for nearly an hour; if I had liked I could have kept\r\nthem there the whole night, for never in my career have I had such an\r\nattentive, such a religiously attentive, audience. The King was the\r\nfirst to notice my fatigue, and he gave the signal for my leaving off by\r\ncoming up and thanking me for my efforts. The Emperor followed his\r\nexample, and stood chatting to me for a long while. In a few minutes I\r\nwas the centre of a circle which I am not likely to forget as long as I\r\nlive. Then came the question how Raphael and I were to get back to\r\nBerlin. The last train was gone. But Schneider simply suggested a\r\nspecial, and a mounted messenger was despatched then and there to order\r\nit. After everything had been arranged for my comfortable return, the\r\nsovereigns departed as they had come, only this time the yacht, as well\r\nas the others on the lake, were splendidly illuminated. This was my\r\nfirst appearance before Nicholas I.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no man to whom Rachel owed more than to Samson, or even as\r\nmuch; but for him, and in spite of her incontestable genius, the\r\nComédie-Français might have remained closed to her for many years, if\r\nnot forever. Frédérick Lemaître and Marie Dorval were undoubtedly, in\r\ntheir own way, as great as she, yet the blue riband of their profession\r\nnever fell to their lot. And yet, when she had reached the topmost rung\r\nof the ladder of fame, Rachel was very often not only ungrateful to him,\r\nbut her ingratitude showed itself in mean, spiteful tricks. When\r\nLegouvé's \"Adrienne Lecouvreur\" was being cast, Samson, who had forgiven\r\nRachel over and over again, was on such cool terms with her that the\r\nauthors feared he would not accept the part of the Prince de Bouillon.\r\nNevertheless, Samson, than whom there was not a more honourable and\r\nconscientious man, on or off the stage, accepted; he would not let his\r\nresentment interfere with what he considered his duty to the institution\r\nof which he was so eminent a member. This alone ought to have been\r\nsufficient to heal the breach between the tutor and the pupil; any woman\r\nwith the least spark of generosity, in the position of Rachel towards\r\nSamson, would have taken the first step towards a reconciliation.\r\nRachel, as will be seen directly, was perfectly conscious of what she\r\nought to do under the circumstances; she was too great an actress not to\r\nhave studied the finer feelings of the human heart, and yet she did not\r\ndo it. On the contrary, she aggravated matters. Every one knows the\r\nfable of \"The Two Pigeons\" which Adrienne recites at the soirée of the\r\nPrincesse de Bouillon. Now, it so happened that the great barrister and\r\norator, Berryer, was considered a most charming reciter of that kind of\r\nverse. Berryer, a most simple-minded man, took special delight in\r\nsharing the most innocent games of young children. He was especially\r\nfond of the game of \"forfeits\"; and so great was his fame as a diseur,\r\nthat the penalty generally imposed upon him was the reciting of a fable.\r\nBut great diseur as he was, he himself acknowledged that Samson could\r\nhave given him a lesson.\r\n\r\nAt every new part she undertook, Rachel was in the habit of consulting\r\nwith her former tutor; this time she went to consult Berryer instead,\r\nand, what was worse, took pains that every one should hear of it. \"Then\r\nmy heart smote me,\" she said afterwards, when by one of those\r\nirresistible tricks of hers she had obtained her tutor's pardon once\r\nmore. It was as deliberate a falsehood as she ever uttered in her life,\r\nwhich in Rachel's case means a good deal. The fact was, the affair, as I\r\nhave already said, had been bruited about, mainly by herself at first;\r\nthe public showed a disposition to take Samson's part, and she felt\r\nafraid of a \"warm reception\" on the first night.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances she had recourse to one of her wiles, which,\r\nfor being theatrical, was not less effective. At the first rehearsal,\r\nwhen Adrienne has to turn to Michonnet, saying, \"This is my true friend,\r\nto whom I owe everything,\" she turned, not to Régnier, who played\r\nMichonnet, and to whom the words are addressed, but to Samson, at the\r\nsame time holding out her hand to him. Samson, who, notwithstanding all\r\ntheir disagreements, very felt proud of his great pupil, who was,\r\nmoreover, of a very affectionate disposition, notwithstanding his\r\nhabitual reserve, fell into the trap. He took her proffered hand; then\r\nshe flung herself into his arms, and the estrangement was at an end,\r\nfor the time being. Rachel took great care to make the reconciliation as\r\npublic as possible.\r\n\r\nI was never very intimate with Samson, but the little I knew of him I\r\nliked. I repeat, he was essentially an honourable and honest man, and\r\nvery tolerant with regard to the foibles of the fair sex. There was need\r\nfor such tolerance in those days. Augustine Brohan, Sylvanie Plessy,\r\nRachel, and half a dozen other women, all very talented, but all very\r\nwayward, made Buloz' life (he was the director of the Comédie-Française,\r\nas well as the editor of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_) a burden to him.\r\nHe who could, and often did, dictate his will to men who already then\r\nwere famous throughout Europe, frequently found himself powerless\r\nagainst women, who, however celebrated, were, with the exception of\r\nRachel, nothing in comparison with the former. He was, it is true,\r\noverbearing to a degree, and disagreeable besides, but his temper proved\r\nof no avail with them; it only made matters worse. \"Après tout,\" he said\r\none day to Madame Allan, who was the most amenable of all, \"je suis le\r\nmaître ici.\" \"Ça se peut, monsieur,\" was the answer, \"mais nous sommes\r\nles contres maître.\"[23]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 23: The play upon the word is scarcely translatable.\r\n         \"Contre-maître\" in the singular means foreman; as it is used\r\n         here it means against the master.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIn nearly all such troubles Régnier and Samson had to act as buffers\r\nbetween the two contending parties; but, as Augustine Brohan explained\r\nonce, the two were utterly different in their mode of casting oil upon\r\nthe troubled waters. \"Régnier,\" she said, \"c'est le bon Dieu des\r\nChrétiens, qui se fait très souvent mener par le nez par des mots. Du\r\nreste son nez s'y prête.[24] Samson c'est le Dieu juste, mais vengeur\r\ndes Juifs, qui veut bien pardonner, mais seulement après soumission\r\ncomplète et entière. Samson ne vous promet pas le ciel, il vous offre\r\ndes compensations solides ici bas.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 24: Régnier's nose was always a subject of jokes\r\n         among his fellow-actors. \"It is not because it is large,\" said\r\n         Beauvallet, \"but because it is his principal organ of\r\n         speech.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to paint the contrast between two characters in\r\nfewer words. In 1845, when Mdlle. Sylvanie Plessy seceded from the\r\nComédie-Française, Régnier wrote a kind epistle, recommending her to\r\ncome and explain matters either personally or by letter. \"Let your\r\nletter be kind and affectionate, and be sure that things will right\r\nthemselves better than you expect.\"\r\n\r\nSamson also wrote, but simply to say that if she did not come back _at\r\nonce_ all the terrors of the law would be invoked against her. Which was\r\ndone. The Comédie-Française instituted proceedings, claiming two hundred\r\nthousand francs damages, and twenty thousand francs \"à titre de\r\nprovision.\"[25] The court cast Mdlle. Plessy in six thousand francs\r\n_provision_, deferring judgment on the principal claim. Two years later\r\nMdlle. Plessy returned and re-entered the fold. Thanks to Samson, she\r\ndid not pay a single farthing of damages, and the Comédie bore the costs\r\nof the whole of the lawsuit.[26]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 25: Damages claimed by one of the parties, pending\r\n         the final verdict.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 26: Curiously enough, it was Émile Augier's\r\n         \"Aventurière\" that caused Mdlle. Plessy's secession, just as it\r\n         did thirty-five years later, in the case of Mdlle. Sarah\r\n         Bernhardt.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nBoth Samson and Régnier were very proud of their profession, but their\r\npride showed itself in different ways. Régnier would have willingly made\r\nany one an actor--that is, a good actor; he was always teaching a great\r\nmany amateurs, staging and superintending their performances. Samson, on\r\nthe other hand, had no sympathy whatsoever with that kind of thing, and\r\ncould rarely be induced to give it aid, but he was very anxious that\r\nevery public speaker should study elocution. \"Eloquence and elocution\r\nare two different things,\" he said; \"and the eloquent man who does not\r\nstudy elocution, is like an Apollo with a bad tailor, and who dresses\r\nwithout a looking-glass. I go further still, and say that every one\r\nought to learn how to speak, not necessarily with the view of amusing\r\nhis friends and acquaintances, but with the view of not annoying them. I\r\nam a busy man, but should be glad to devote three hours a week to teach\r\nthe rising generation, and especially the humbler ones, how to speak.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with that wish of Samson, that every man whose duties\r\ncompelled him, or who voluntarily undertook to speak in public, should\r\nbe a trained elocutionist, I remember a curious story of which I was\r\nmade the recipient quite by accident. It was in the year '60, one\r\nmorning in the summer, that I happened to meet Samson in the Rue\r\nVivienne. We exchanged a few words, shook hands, and each went his own\r\nway. In the afternoon I was sitting at Tortoni's, when a gentleman of\r\nabout thirty-five came up to me. \"Monsieur,\" he said, \"will you allow\r\nme to ask you a question?\" \"Certainly, monsieur, if it be one I can\r\nanswer,\" I replied. \"I believe,\" he said, \"that I saw you in the Rue\r\nVivienne this morning talking to some one whose name I do not know, but\r\nto whom I am under great obligations. I was in a great hurry and in a\r\ncab, and before I could stop the cabman both of you had disappeared.\r\nWill you mind telling me his name?\" \"I recollect being in the Rue\r\nVivienne and meeting with M. Samson of the Comédie-Française,\" I\r\nanswered. \"I thought so,\" remarked my interlocutor. \"Allow me to thank\r\nyou, monsieur.\" With this he lifted his hat and went out.\r\n\r\nThe incident had slipped my memory altogether, when I was reminded of it\r\nby Samson himself, about three weeks afterwards, in the green-room of\r\nthe Comédie-Française. I had been there but a few moments when he came\r\nin. \"You are the man who betrayed me,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I have\r\nbeen cudgelling my brain for the last three weeks as to who it could\r\nhave been, for I spoke to no less than half a dozen friends and\r\nacquaintances in the Rue Vivienne on the morning I met you, and they all\r\nwear imperials and moustaches. A nice thing you have done for me; you\r\nhave burdened me with a grateful friend for the rest of my life!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he told me the story, how two years before he had been at\r\nGranville during the end of the summer; how he had strolled into the\r\nPalais de Justice and heard the procureur-impérial make a speech for the\r\nprosecution, the delivery of which would have disgraced his most\r\nbackward pupil at the Conservatoire. \"I was very angry with the fellow,\r\nand felt inclined to write him a letter, telling him that there was no\r\nneed to torture the innocent audience, as well as the prisoner in the\r\ndock. I should have signed it. I do not know why I did not, but judge of\r\nmy surprise when, the same evening at dinner, I found myself seated\r\nopposite him. I must have scowled at him, and he repaid scowl for scowl.\r\nIt appears that he was living at the hotel temporarily, while his wife\r\nand child were away. I need not tell you the high opinion our judges\r\nhave of themselves, and I dare say he thought it the height of\r\nimpertinence that I, a simple mortal, should stare at him. I soon came\r\nto the conclusion, however, that if I wanted to spare my\r\nfellow-creatures such an infliction as I had endured that day, I ought\r\nnot to arouse the man's anger. So I looked more mild, then entered into\r\nconversation with him. You should have seen his face when I began to\r\ncriticize his tone and gestures. But he evidently felt that I was\r\nsomewhat of an authority on the subject, and at last I took him out on\r\nthe beach and gave him a lesson in delivering a speech, and left him\r\nthere without revealing my name. Next morning I went away, and never set\r\neyes on him again until three weeks ago, when he left his card, asking\r\nfor an interview. He is a very intelligent man, and has profited by the\r\nfirst lesson. During the three days he remained in Paris I gave him\r\nthree more. He says that if ever I get into a scrape, he'll do better\r\nthan defend me--prosecute me, and I'm sure to get off.\"\r\n\r\nI have never seen Samson give a lesson at the Conservatoire, but I was\r\npresent at several of Régnier's, thanks to Auber, whom I knew very well,\r\nand who was the director, and to Régnier himself, who did not mind a\r\nstranger being present, provided he felt certain that the stranger was\r\nnot a scoffer. I believe that Samson would have objected without\r\nreference to the stranger's disposition; at any rate, Auber hinted as\r\nmuch, so I did not prefer my request in a direct form.\r\n\r\nI doubt, moreover, whether a lesson of Samson to his pupils would have\r\nbeen as interesting to the outsider as one of Régnier's. Of all the\r\ngifts that go to the making of a great actor, Régnier had naturally only\r\ntwo--taste and intelligence; the others were replaced by what, for want\r\nof a better term, one might call the tricks of the actor; their\r\nacquisition demanded constant study. For instance, Régnier's appearance\r\noff the stage was absolutely insignificant; his voice was naturally\r\nhusky and indistinct, and, moreover, what the French call nasillarde,\r\nthat is, produced through the nose. His features were far from mobile;\r\nthe eyes were not without expression, but these never twinkled with\r\nmerriment nor shone with passion. Consequently, the smallest as well as\r\nlargest effect necessary to the interpretation of a character had to be\r\nthought out carefully beforehand, and then to be tried over and over\r\nagain materially. Each of his inflections had to be timed to a second;\r\nbut when all this was accomplished, the picture presented by him was so\r\nperfect as to deceive the most experienced critic, let alone an\r\naudience, however intelligent. In fact, but for his own frank admission\r\nof all this, his contemporaries and posterity would have been never the\r\nwiser, for, to their honour be it said, his fellow-actors were so\r\ninterested in watching him \"manipulate himself,\" as they termed it, as\r\nto never breathe a word of it to the outside world. They all\r\nacknowledged that they had learned something from him during rehearsal.\r\nFor instance, in one of his best-known characters, that of the old\r\nservant in Madame de Girardin's \"La Joie fait peur,\"[27] there is a\r\nscene which, as played by Régnier and Delaunay, looked to the spectator\r\nabsolutely spontaneous. The smallest detail had been minutely regulated.\r\nIt is where the old retainer, while dusting the room, is talking to\r\nhimself about his young master, Lieutenant Adrien Desaubiers, who is\r\nreported dead.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 27: There are several English versions of the play,\r\n         and I am under the impression that the late Tom Robertson was\r\n         inspired by it when he adapted \"Caste.\" I allude to that scene\r\n         in the third act, where George d'Alroy returns unexpectedly and\r\n         where Polly Eccles breaks the news to her sister.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"I can see him now,\" says Noël, who cannot resign himself to the idea;\r\n\"I can see him now, as he used to come in from his long walks, tired,\r\nstarving, and shouting before he was fairly into the house. 'Here I am,\r\nmy good Noël; I am dying with hunger. Quick! an omelette.'\" At that\r\nmoment the young lieutenant enters the room, and having heard Noël's\r\nlast sentence, repeats it word for word.\r\n\r\nShort as was the sentence, it had been arranged that Delaunay should\r\nvirtually cut it into four parts.\r\n\r\nAt the words, \"_It is I_,\" Régnier shivered from head to foot; at \"_Here\r\nI am, my good Noël_,\" he lifted his eyes heavenwards, to make sure that\r\nthe voice did not come from there, and that he was not labouring under a\r\nkind of hallucination; at the words, \"_I am dying with hunger_,\" he came\r\nto the conclusion that it was a real human voice after all; and at the\r\nfinal, \"_Quick! an omelette_,\" he turned round quickly, and fell like a\r\nlog into the young fellow's arms.\r\n\r\nI repeat, the whole of the scene had been timed to the fraction of a\r\nsecond; nevertheless, on the first night, Régnier, nervous as all great\r\nactors are on such occasions, forgot all about his own arrangements,\r\nand, at the first sound of Delaunay's voice, was so overcome with\r\nemotion that he literally tumbled against the latter, who of course was\r\nnot prepared to bear him up, and had all his work to do to keep himself\r\nfrom falling also. Meanwhile Régnier lay stretched at full length on the\r\nstage, and the house broke into tumultuous applause.\r\n\r\n\"That was magnificent,\" said Delaunay after the performance. \"Suppose we\r\nrepeat the thing to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nBut Régnier would not hear of it; he stuck to his original conception in\r\nfour tempi. He preferred trusting to his art rather than to the frank\r\npromptings of nature.\r\n\r\nThat is why a lesson of Régnier to his pupils was so interesting to the\r\noutsider. The latter was, as it were, initiated into all the resources\r\nthe great actor has at his command wherewith to produce his illusion\r\nupon the public. Among Régnier's pupils those were his favourites who\r\nnever allowed themselves to be carried away by their feelings, and who\r\ntrusted to these resources as indicated to them by their tutor. He was\r\nto a certain extent doubtful of the others. \"Feelings vary; effects\r\nintelligently conceived, studied, and carried out ought never to vary,\"\r\nhe said. Consequently it became one of his theories that those most\r\nplentifully endowed with natural gifts were not likely to become more\r\nperfect than those who had been treated niggardly in that respect,\r\nprovided the vocation and the perseverance were there. The reverse of\r\nSamson, who was proudest of Rachel, Régnier was never half as proud of\r\nM. Coquelin as of others who had given him far more trouble. Augustine\r\nBrohan explained the feeling in her own inimitable way: \"Régnier est\r\ncomme le grand seigneur qui s'énamourache d'une paysanne à qui il faut\r\ntout enseigner; si moi j'étais homme, j'aimerais mieux une demoiselle de\r\nbonne famille, qui n'aurait pas besoin de tant d'enseignement.\"\r\n\r\nMdlle. Brohan exaggerated a little bit. Régnier's pupils were not\r\npeasant children, to whom he had to teach everything; a great many, like\r\nCoquelin, required very little teaching, and all the others had the\r\nreceptive qualities which make teaching a pleasure. The latter, boys and\r\ngirls, had to a certain extent become like Régnier himself, \"bundles of\r\ntricks,\" and, what is perhaps not so surprising to students of\r\npsychology and physiology, their features had contracted a certain\r\nlikeness to his. At the first blush one might have mistaken them for his\r\nchildren. And they might have been, for the patience he had with them.\r\nIt was rarely exhausted, but he now and then seemed to be waiting for a\r\nnew supply. At such times there was a frantic clutch at the shock,\r\ngrey-haired head, or else a violent blowing of the perky nose in a large\r\ncrimson chequered handkerchief, its owner standing all the while on one\r\nleg; the attitude was irresistibly comic, but the pupils were used to\r\nit, and not a muscle of their faces moved.\r\n\r\nThose who imagine that Régnier's courses were merely so many lessons of\r\nelocution and gesticulation would be altogether mistaken. Régnier,\r\nunlike many of his great fellow-actors of that period, had received a\r\ngood education: he had been articled to an architect, he had even\r\ndabbled in painting, and there were few historical personages into whose\r\ncharacters he had not a thorough insight. He was a fair authority upon\r\ncostume and manners of the Middle Ages, and his acquaintance with Roman\r\nand Greek antiquities would have done credit to many a professor. He was\r\ncalled \"le comédien savant\" and \"le savant comédien.\" As such, whenever\r\na pupil failed to grasp the social or political importance of one of the\r\n_dramatis personæ_ of Racine's or Corneille's play, there was sure to be\r\na disquisition, telling the youngster all about him, but in a way such\r\nas to secure the attention of the listener--a way that might have\r\naroused the envy of a university lecturer. The dry bones of history were\r\nclothed by a man with an eye for the picturesque.\r\n\r\n\"Who do you think Augustus was?\" he said one day when I was present, to\r\nthe pupil, who was declaiming some lines of \"Cinna.\" \"Do you think he\r\nwas the concierge or le commissionnaire du coin?\" And forthwith there\r\nwas a sketch of Augustus. Absolutely quivering with life, he led his\r\nlistener through the streets of Rome, entered the palace with him, and\r\nonce there, became Augustus himself. After such a scene he would\r\nfrequently descend the few steps of the platform and drop into his\r\narmchair, exhausted.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, in connection with some character of Molière or\r\nRegnard, there would be an anecdote of the great interpreter of the\r\ncharacter, but an anecdote enacted, after which the eyes would fill with\r\ntears, and the ample chequered handkerchief come into requisition once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nRégnier was a great favourite with most of his fellow-actors and the\r\nemployés of the Comédie-Française, but he was positively worshipped by\r\nGiovanni, the wigmaker of the establishment. They were in frequent\r\nconsultation even in the green-room, the privilege of admission to which\r\nhad been granted to the Italian Figaro. The consultations became most\r\nfrequent when one of the members undertook a part new to him. It was\r\noften related of Balzac that he firmly believed in the existence of the\r\ncharacters his brain had created. The same might be said of Régnier with\r\nregard to the characters created by the great playwrights of his own\r\ntime and those of the past. Of course, I am not speaking of those who\r\nhad an historical foundation. But Alceste, Harpagon, Georges Dandin,\r\nSganarelle, and Scapin were as real to him as Orestes and Oedipus, as\r\nAugustus and Mohammed. He would give not only their biographies, but\r\ndescribe their appearance, their manners, their gait, and even their\r\ncomplexion. The first time I heard him do so, I made sure that he was\r\ntrying to mystify Giovanni; but Rachel, who was present, soon undeceived\r\nme. And the Italian would sit listening reverently, then start up, and\r\nexclaim, \"Ze sais ce qu'il vous faut, Monsu Régnier, ze vais faire oune\r\nparruque à étonner Molière lui-même.\" And he kept his word, because he\r\nconsidered that the wig contributed as much to, or detracted from, the\r\nsuccess of an actor as his diction, and more than his clothes. When\r\nDelaunay became a sociétaire his first part was that of the lover in M.\r\nViennet's \"Migraine.\" \"Voilà Monsu Delaunay, oune véritable parruque di\r\nsociétaire. Zouez à présent, vous êtes sour de votre affaire.\"\r\n\r\nOne day Beauvallet found him standing before the window of Brandus, the\r\nmusic-publisher in the Rue de Richelieu. He was contemplating the\r\nportrait of Rossini, and he looked sad.\r\n\r\n\"What are you standing there for, Giovanni?\" asked Beauvallet.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Monsu Bouvallet, I am looking at the portrait of Maëstro Giovanni\r\nRossini, and when I think that his name is Giovanni like mine, when I\r\nsee that abominable wig which looks like a grass-plot after a month of\r\ndrought, I feel ashamed and sad. But I will go and see him, and make him\r\na wig for love or money that will take twenty years off his age.\" He\r\nwent, but Rossini would not hear of it, or rather Madame Rossini put a\r\nspoke in his wheel. Giovanni never mentioned his name again. It was\r\nLigier who brought Giovanni to Paris, and for a quarter of a century he\r\nworked unremittingly for the glory of the Comédie-Française, and when\r\none of the great critics happened to speak favourably of the \"make-up\"\r\nof an actor, as Paul de St. Victor did when Régnier \"created Noël,\"\r\nGiovanni used to leave his card at his house. It was Giovanni who made\r\nthe wigs for M. Ancessy, the musical director at the Odéon, who, under\r\nthe management of M. Edouard Thierry, occupied the same position at the\r\nComédie-Française. M. Ancessy was not only a good chef d'orchestre, but\r\na composer of talent; but he had one great weakness--he was as bald as\r\na billiard-ball and wished to pass for an Absalom. Giovanni helped him\r\nto carry out the deception by making three artistic wigs. The first was\r\nof very short hair, and was worn from the 1st to the 10th of the month;\r\nfrom the 11th to the 20th M. Ancessy donned one with hair that was so\r\nvisibly growing as to cover his ears. From the 20th to the last day of\r\nthe month his locks were positively flowing, and he never failed to say\r\non that last evening in the hearing of every one, \"What a terrible\r\nnuisance my hair is to me! I must have it cut to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     Two composers, Auber and Félicien David -- Auber, the legend of\r\n     his youthful appearance -- How it arose -- His daily rides, his\r\n     love of women's society -- His mot on Mozart's \"Don Juan\" -- The\r\n     only drawback to Auber's enjoyment of women's society -- His\r\n     reluctance to take his hat off -- How he managed to keep it on\r\n     most of the time -- His opinion upon Meyerbeer's and Halévy's\r\n     genius -- His opinion upon Gérard de Nerval, who hanged himself\r\n     with his hat on -- His love of solitude -- His fondness of Paris\r\n     -- His grievance against his mother for not having given him\r\n     birth there -- He refuses to leave Paris at the commencement of\r\n     the siege -- His small appetite -- He proposes to write a new\r\n     opera when the Prussians are gone -- Auber suffers no privations,\r\n     but has difficulty in finding fodder for his horse -- The\r\n     Parisians claim it for food -- Another legend about Auber's\r\n     independence of sleep -- How and where he generally slept -- Why\r\n     Auber snored in Véron's company, and why he did not in that of\r\n     other people -- His capacity for work -- Auber a brilliant talker\r\n     -- Auber's gratitude to the artists who interpreted his work, but\r\n     different from Meyerbeer's -- The reason why, according to Auber\r\n     -- Jealousy or humility -- Auber and the younger Coquelin -- \"The\r\n     verdict on all things in this world may be summed up in the one\r\n     phrase, 'It's an injustice'\" -- Félicien David -- The man -- The\r\n     beginnings of his career -- His terrible poverty -- He joins the\r\n     Saint-Simoniens, and goes with some of them to the East -- Their\r\n     reception at Constantinople -- M.

He and\r\nI were in Paris during the siege and the Commune; we saw one another\r\nfrequently, and I am positive that the terrible misfortunes of his\r\ncountry shortened his life by at least ten years. For though at the\r\nbeginning of the campaign he was close upon ninety, he scarcely looked a\r\ntwelvemonth older than when I first knew him, nearly three decades\r\nbefore; that is, a very healthy and active old man, but still an old\r\nman. So much nonsense has been written about his perpetual youth, that\r\nit is well to correct the error. But the ordinary French public, and\r\nmany journalists besides, could not understand an octogenarian being on\r\nhorseback almost every day of his life, any more than they understood\r\nlater on M. de Lesseps doing the same. They did not and do not know M.\r\nMackenzie-Grieves, and half a dozen English residents in Paris of a\r\nsimilar age, who scarcely ever miss their daily ride. If they had known\r\nthem, they might perhaps have been less loud in their admiration of the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nWhat added, probably, to Auber's reputation of possessing the secret of\r\nperpetual youth was his great fondness for women's society, his very\r\nhandsome appearance, though he was small comparatively, and his\r\nfaultless way of dressing. He was most charming with the fairer sex, and\r\nmany of the female pupils of the Conservatoire positively doted on him.\r\nThough polite to a degree with men--and I doubt whether Auber could have\r\nbeen other than polite with no matter whom--his smiles, I mean his\r\nbenevolent ones, for he could smile very sceptically, were exclusively\r\nreserved for women. When he heard Mozart's \"Don Juan\" for the first\r\ntime, he said, \"This is the music of a lover of twenty, and if a man be\r\nnot an imbecile, he may always have in a little corner of his heart the\r\nsentiment or fancy that he is only twenty.\"\r\n\r\nThere was but one drawback to Auber's enjoyment of the society of\r\nwomen--he was obliged to take off his hat in their presence, and he\r\nhated being without that article of dress. He might have worn a\r\nskull-cap at home, though there was no necessity for it, as far as his\r\nhair was concerned, for up to the last he was far from bald; but he\r\nwanted his hat. He composed with his hat on, he had his meals with his\r\nhat on, and though he would have frequently preferred to take his seat\r\nin the stalls or balcony of a theatre, he invariably had a box, and\r\ngenerally one on the stage, in order to keep his hat on. He would often\r\nstand for hours on the balcony of his house in the Rue Saint-Georges\r\nwith his hat on. \"I never feel as much at home anywhere, not even in my\r\nown apartment, as in the synagogue,\" he said one day. He frequently went\r\nthere for no earthly reason than because he could sit among a lot of\r\npeople with his hat on. In fact, those frequent visits, coupled with his\r\ndislike to be bareheaded, made people wonder now and then whether Auber\r\nwas a Jew. The supposition always made Auber smile. \"That would have\r\nmeant the genius of a Meyerbeer, a Mendelssohn, or a Halévy,\" he said.\r\n\"No, I have been lucky enough in my life, but such good fortune as that\r\nnever fell to my lot.\" For there was no man so willing--nay, anxious--to\r\nacknowledge the merit of others as Auber. But Auber was not a Jew, and\r\nhis mania for keeping on his hat had nothing to do with his religion. It\r\nwas simply a mania, and nothing more. When, in January, '55, Gérard de\r\nNerval was found suspended from a lamp-post in the Rue de la\r\nVieille-Lanterne, he had his hat on his head; his friends, and even the\r\npolice, pretended to argue from this that he had not committed suicide,\r\nbut had been murdered. \"A man who is going to hang himself does not keep\r\nhis hat on,\" they said. \"Pourquoi pas, mon Dieu?\" asked Auber, simply.\r\n\"If I were going to kill myself, I should certainly keep my hat on.\" In\r\nshort, it was the only thing about Auber which could not be explained.\r\n\r\nAuber was exceedingly fond of society, and yet he was fond of solitude\r\nalso. Many a time his friends reported that, returning home late from a\r\nparty, they found Auber standing opposite his house in the Rue\r\nSaint-Georges, with apparently no other object than to contemplate it\r\nfrom below. After his return to Paris from London, whither he had been\r\nsent by his father, in order to become conversant with English business\r\nhabits, he never left the capital again, though at the end of his life\r\nhe regretted not having been to Italy. It was because Rossini, who was\r\none of his idols, had said \"that a musician should loiter away some of\r\nhis time under that sky.\" But almost immediately he comforted himself\r\nwith the thought that Paris, after all, was the only city worth living\r\nin. \"I was very fond of my mother, but I have one grievance against her\r\nmemory. What did she want to go to Caen for just at the moment when I\r\nwas about to be born? But for that I should have been a real Parisian.\"\r\nI do not think it made much difference, for I never knew such an\r\ninveterate Parisian as Auber. When the investment of Paris had become an\r\nabsolute certainty, some of his friends pressed him to leave; he would\r\nnot hear of it. They predicted discomfort, famine, and what-not. \"The\r\nlatter contingency will not affect me much, seeing that I eat but once a\r\nday, and very little then. As for the sound of the firing disturbing me,\r\nI do not think it will. It has often been said that the first part of my\r\noverture to 'Fra Diavolo' was inspired by the retreating tramp of the\r\nregiment; there may be some truth in it. If it be vouchsafed to me to\r\nhear the retreating tramp of the Germans, I will write an overture and\r\nan opera, which will be something different, I promise you.\"\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that, personally, Auber suffered any privations during\r\nthe siege. A man in his position, who required but one meal a day, and\r\nthat a very light one, was sure to find it somewhere; but he had great\r\ntrouble to find sufficient fodder for his old faithful hack, that had\r\ncarried him for years, and when, after several months of scheming and\r\ncontriving to that effect, he was forced to give it up as food for\r\nothers, his cup of bitterness was full. \"Ils m'ont pris mon vieux cheval\r\npour le manger,\" he repeated, when I saw him after the event; \"je\r\nl'avais depuis vingt ans.\" It was really a great blow to him.\r\n\r\nThere is another legend about Auber which is not founded upon facts,\r\nnamely, that he was pretty well independent of sleep. It was perfectly\r\ntrue that he went to bed very late and rose very early, but most people\r\nhave overlooked the fact that during the evening he had had a\r\ncomfortable doze, of at least an hour and a half or two hours, at the\r\ntheatre. He rarely missed a performance at the Opéra or Opéra-Comique,\r\nexcept when his own work was performed. And during that time he\r\nslumbered peacefully, \"en homme du monde,\" said Nestor Roqueplan,\r\n\"without snoring.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never knew what it meant to snore,\" said Auber, apologetically,\r\n\"until I took to sleeping in Véron's box; and as it is, I do not snore\r\nnow except under provocation. But there would be no possibility of\r\nsleeping by the side of Véron without snoring. You have to drown his, or\r\nelse it would awaken you.\"\r\n\r\nAuber was a brilliant talker, but he scarcely ever liked to exert\r\nhimself except on the subject of music. It was all in all to him, and\r\nthe amount of work he did must have been something tremendous. There are\r\nfew students of the history of operatic music, no matter how excellent\r\ntheir memories, who could give the complete list of Auber's works by\r\nheart. We tried it once in 1850, when that list was much shorter than it\r\nis now; there was not a single one who gave it correctly. The only one\r\nwho came within a measureable distance was Roger, the tenor.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his world-wide reputation, even at that time, Auber was as\r\nmodest about his work as Meyerbeer, but he had more confidence in\r\nhimself than the latter. Auber was by no means ungrateful to the artists\r\nwho contributed to his success; \"but I don't 'coddle' them, and put\r\nthem in cotton-wool, like Meyerbeer,\" he said. \"It is perfectly logical\r\nthat he should do so. The Nourrits, the Levasseurs, the Viardot-Garcias,\r\nand the Rogers, are not picked up at street-corners; but bring me the\r\nfirst urchin you meet, who has a decent voice, and a fair amount of\r\nintelligence, and in six months he'll sing the most difficult part I\r\never wrote, with the exception of that of Masaniello. My operas are a\r\nkind of warming-pan for great singers. There is something in being a\r\ngood warming-pan.\"\r\n\r\nAt the first blush, this sounds something like jealousy in the guise of\r\nhumility, but I am certain that there was no jealousy in Auber's\r\ncharacter. Few men have been so uniformly successful, but he also had\r\nhis early struggles, \"when perhaps I did better work than I have done\r\nsince.\" The last sentence was invariably trolled out when a pupil of the\r\nConservatoire complained to him of having been unjustly dealt with. I\r\nremember Coquelin the younger competing for the \"prize of Comedy\" in '65\r\nor '66. He did not get it, and when we came out of Auber's box at the\r\nConservatoire, the young fellow came up to him with tears in his eyes. I\r\nfancy they were tears of anger rather than of sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Monsieur Auber,\" he exclaimed, \"that's an injustice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so, my dear lad,\" replied Auber; \"but remember that the verdict\r\non all things in this world may be summed up in the words you have just\r\nuttered, 'It's an injustice.' Let me give you a bit of advice. If you\r\nmean to become a good Figaro, you must be the first to laugh at an\r\ninjustice instead of weeping over it.\" Wherewith he turned his back upon\r\nthe now celebrated comedian. In the course of these notes I shall have\r\noccasion to speak of Auber again.\r\n\r\nAuber need not have generalized to young Coquelin; he might have cited\r\none instance of injustice in his own profession, to which, fortunately,\r\nthere was no parallel for at least thirty years. In the forties the\r\ncritics refused to recognize the genius of Félicien David, just as they\r\nhad refused to recognize the genius of Hector Berlioz. In the seventies\r\nthey were morally guilty of the death of Georges Bizet, the composer of\r\n\"Carmen.\"\r\n\r\nI knew little or nothing of Hector Berlioz, but I frequently met\r\nFélicien David at Auber's. It was a pity to behold the man even after\r\nhis success--a success which, however, did not put money in his purse.\r\nHis moral sufferings, his material privations, had left their traces but\r\ntoo plainly on the face as well as on the mind. David had positively\r\nstarved in order to buy the few books and the paper necessary to his\r\nstudies, and yet he had the courage to say, \"If I had to begin over\r\nagain, I would do the same.\" The respectability that drives a gig when\r\nincarnated in parents who refuse to believe in the power of soaring of\r\ntheir offspring because they, the parents, cannot see the wings, has\r\nassuredly much to answer for. Flotow's father stops the supplies after\r\nseven years, because his son has not come up to time like a race-horse.\r\nBerlioz' father does not give him so long a shrift; he allows him three\r\nmonths to conquer fame. Félicien David had no father to help or to\r\nthwart him in his ambition. He was an orphan at the age of five, and\r\nleft to the care of a sister, who was too poor to help him; but he had\r\nan uncle who was well-to-do, and who allowed him the magnificent sum of\r\nfifty francs per month--for a whole quarter--and then withdrew it,\r\nnotwithstanding the assurance of Cherubini that the young fellow had the\r\nmaking of a great composer in him. And the worst is that these young\r\nfellows suffer in silence, while there are hundreds of benevolent rich\r\nmen who would willingly open their purses to them. When they do reveal\r\ntheir distressed condition, it is generally to some one as poor as\r\nthemselves. These rich men buy the autographs of the deceased genius for\r\nsmall or large sums which would have provided the struggling ones with\r\ncomforts for days and days. I have before me such a letter which I\r\nbought for ten francs. I would willingly have given ten times the amount\r\nnot to have bought it. It is written to a friend of his youth. \"As for\r\nmoney,\" it says, \"seeing that I am bound to speak of it, things are\r\ngoing from bad to worse. And it is very certain that in a little while I\r\nshall have to give it up altogether. I have been ill for three weeks\r\nwith pains in the back, and fever and ague everywhere. I dare say that\r\nmy illness was brought on by my worries, and by the bad food of the\r\nParis restaurants, also by the constant dampness. Why am I not a little\r\nbetter off? I fancy that the slight comforts an artist may reasonably\r\nexpect would do me a great deal of good. I am not speaking of the body,\r\nthough it is a part of ourselves which considerably affects our\r\nintellect, but my imagination would be the better for it, for how can my\r\nbrain, constantly occupied as it is with the worry of material wants,\r\nact unhampered? Really, I do not hesitate to say that poverty and\r\nprivation kill the imagination.\"\r\n\r\nThey did not kill the imagination in David's case, but they undermined\r\nhis constitution. It was at that period that he fell in with the\r\nSaint-Simoniens, to the high priest of which, M. Enfantin, who\r\neventually became the chairman of the Paris, Lyons, and Mediterranean\r\nRailway Company, he took me many years later. After their dispersion,\r\nthe group to which he belonged went to the East, and it is to this\r\napparently fortuitous circumstance that the world owes not only \"Le\r\nDésert,\" \"La Perle du Brésil,\" and \"L'Eden,\" but probably also\r\nMeyerbeer's \"Africaine.\" Meyerbeer virtually acknowledged that but for\r\nDavid's scores, so replete with the poetry of the Orient, he would have\r\nnever thought of such a subject for one of his operas. M. Scribe, on the\r\nother hand, always maintained that the idea emanated from him, and that\r\nit dated from 1847, when the composer was given the choice between \"La\r\nProphète\" and \"L'Africaine,\" and chose the former. One might almost\r\nparaphrase the accusation of the wolf against the lamb in La Fontaine's\r\nfable. \"M. Scribe, if you did not owe your idea to Félicien David, you\r\nowed it to Montigny, the director of the Gymnase, who in the thirties\r\nproduced a play with a curious name, and a more curious plot, at the\r\nAmbigu-Comique.\"[28] One thing is certain, that \"L'Africaine\" was\r\ndiscarded, if ever it was offered, and would never have been thought of\r\nagain but for Meyerbeer's intense and frankly acknowledged admiration of\r\nFélicien David's genius.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 28: I have taken some pains to unearth this play. It\r\n         was called \"Amazampo; or, The Discovery of Quinine.\" The scene\r\n         was laid in Peru in 1636. Amazampo, the chief of a Peruvian\r\n         tribe, is in love with Maïda, who on her part is in love with\r\n         Ferdinand, the son of the viceroy. Amazampo is heart-broken,\r\n         and is stricken down with fever. In his despair and partial\r\n         delirium he tries to poison himself, and drinks the water of a\r\n         pool in which several trunks of a tree called _kina_, reported\r\n         poisonous, have been lying for years. He feels the effect\r\n         almost immediately, but not the effect he expected. He\r\n         recovers, and takes advantage of his recovered health to forget\r\n         his love passion, and to be avenged upon the oppressors of his\r\n         country, many of whom are dying with fever. Lima becomes a huge\r\n         cemetery. Then the wife of the viceroy is stricken down. Maïda\r\n         wishes to save her, but is forestalled by Amazampo, who compels\r\n         Dona Theodora to drink the liquor, and so forth. But Amazampo\r\n         and Maïda die.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to Félicien David, whose melancholy vanished as\r\nif by magic when he related his wanderings in the East. I do not mean\r\nthe poetical side of them, which inspired him with his great\r\ncompositions, but the ludicrous one. I do not remember the dress of the\r\nSaint-Simoniens, I was too young at the time to have noticed it, but am\r\ntold it consisted of a blue tunic and trousers to match, a scarlet\r\njersey, which buttoned at the back, and could not be undone except with\r\nthe aid of some one else. It was meant to symbolize mutual dependence\r\nupon one another. \"As far as Marseilles everything went comparatively\r\nwell,\" said David; \"we lived by giving concerts, and though the receipts\r\nwere by no means magnificent, they kept the wolf from the door. Our\r\ntroubles began at Constantinople. Whether they did not like our music,\r\nor ourselves, or our dresses, I have never been able to make out, but we\r\nwere soon denounced to the authorities, and marched off to prison,\r\nthough our incarceration did not last more than a couple of hours,\r\nthanks to our ambassador, Admiral Roussin. Our liberation, however, was\r\nconditional; we had to leave at once. We made our way to Smyrna, where\r\nmy music seemed to meet with a little more favour. I performed every\r\nnight, but in the open air, and some one took the hat round, just as if\r\nwe had been a company of ambulant musicians to the manner born. We were,\r\nhowever, not altogether unhappy, for we had enough to eat and to drink,\r\nwhich with me, at any rate, was a paramount consideration. Up till then\r\nsufficient food had not been a daily item in my programme of life. My\r\ncompanions, nevertheless, became restless; they said they had not come\r\nto eat and drink and play music, but to convert the most benighted part\r\nof Europe to their doctrines; so we moved to Jaffa and Jerusalem, then\r\nto Alexandria, and finally to Cairo. By the time we got there, only\r\nthree of us were left; the rest had gone homeward. Koenig-Bey had just\r\nat that moment undertaken the tuition of Mehemet-Ali's children--there\r\nwere between sixty and seventy at that time; it was he who presented me\r\nto their father, with a view of my becoming the professor of music to\r\nthe inmates of the harem. 'It is of no use to try to get you the\r\nappointment of professor of music to the young princes, because Mehemet,\r\nthough intelligent enough, would certainly not hear of it. He would not\r\nthink it necessary that a man-child should devote himself to so\r\neffeminate an accomplishment. I am translating his own thoughts on the\r\nsubject, not mine. When I tell you that my monthly report about their\r\nintellectual progress is invariably waved off with the words, \"Tell me\r\nhow much they have gained or lost in weight,\" you will understand that I\r\nam not speaking at random. The viceroy thinks that hard study should\r\nproduce a corresponding decrease in weight, which is not always the\r\ncase, for those more or less inclined to obesity make flesh in virtue of\r\ntheir sitting too much. Consequently the fat kine have a very bad time\r\nof it, and among the latter is one of the most intelligent boys,\r\nMohammed-Said.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who would infer from this,\" said David one day, referring to the\r\nsame subject, \"that Mehemet-Ali was lacking in intelligence, would\r\ncommit a grave error. I am convinced, from the little I saw of him, that\r\nhe was a man of very great natural parts. His features, though not\r\nabsolutely handsome, were very striking and expressive. He was over\r\nsixty then, but looked as if he could bear any amount of fatigue. His\r\nconstitution must originally have been an iron one. Instead of the\r\nOriental repose which I expected, there was a kind of semi-European,\r\nsemi-military stiffness about him, which, however, soon wore off in\r\nconversation. I say advisedly conversation, albeit that he did not\r\nunderstand a word of French, which was the only language I spoke, and\r\nthat I could not catch a word of his. But in spite of Koenig-Bey's\r\nacting the interpreter, it was a conversation between us both. He seemed\r\nto catch the meaning of my words the moment they left my lips, and every\r\nnow and then smiled at my remarks. He as it were read the thoughts that\r\nprovoked them, and I do not wonder at his having been amused, for I\r\nmyself was never so amused in my life. Perhaps you will be, when I tell\r\nyou that I was not to see the ladies I had to teach; my instruction was\r\nto be given to the eunuchs, who, in their turn, had to transmit them to\r\nthe viceroy's wives and daughters. Of course, I tried to point out the\r\nimpossibility of such a system, but Mehemet-Ali shook his head with a\r\nknowing smile. That was the only way he would have his womenkind\r\ninitiated into the beauties of Mozart and Mendelssohn. I need not tell\r\nyou that the arrangement came to nought.\"\r\n\r\nNearly all these conversations which I have noted down here, without\r\nmuch attempt at transition, took place at different times. One day, when\r\nhe was relating some experiences of his wanderings through the less busy\r\nhaunts of Egypt, I happened to say, \"After all, Monsieur David, they did\r\nyou good; they inspired you with the themes of your most beautiful\r\nworks.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a very bitter smile that played on his lips, but only for a\r\nmoment; the next his face resumed its usual melancholy expression. \"Yes,\r\nthey did me good. Do you know what occurred on the eve of the first\r\nperformance of 'Le Désert,' on the morrow of which I may say without\r\nundue pride that I found myself famous? Well, I will tell you. But for\r\nAzevedo, I should have gone supperless that night.[29] I met him on the\r\nBoulevards, and I almost forced him to take some tickets, for I was\r\nhungry and desperate. I had been running about that morning to dispose\r\nof some tickets for love or money, for what I feared most was an empty\r\nhouse. I had sold half a dozen, perhaps, but no one had paid me. Azevedo\r\nsaid, 'Yes, send me some this afternoon.' 'I can give them to you now,'\r\nI replied, 'for I carry my box office upon me.' Then he understood, and\r\ngave me the money. May God bless him for it, for ever and ever!\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 29: Alexis Azevedo, one of the best musical critics\r\n         of the time, as enthusiastic in his likes as unreasoning in his\r\n         dislikes. He became a fervent admirer of Félicien\r\n         David.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"Now would you like to hear what happened after the performance?\" he\r\ncontinued. \"The place was full and the applause tremendous. Next morning\r\nthe papers were full of my name; I was, according to most of them, 'a\r\nrevelation in music.' But for all that I was living in an attic on a\r\nfifth floor, and had not sufficient money to pay my orchestra, let alone\r\nto arrange for another concert. As for the score of 'Le Désert,' it went\r\nthe round of every publisher but one, and was declined by all these. At\r\nlast the firm of Escudier offered me twelve hundred francs for it,\r\nwhich, of course, I was glad to take. They behaved handsomely after all,\r\nbecause they arranged for a series of performances of it, which I was to\r\ndirect at a fee of a thousand francs per performance. Those good\r\nSaint-Simoniens, the Pereiras, Enfantin, Michel Chevalier, had not\r\nlifted a finger to help me in my need; nevertheless, I was not going to\r\ncondemn good principles on account of the men who represented them not\r\nvery worthily. Do you know what was the result of this determination not\r\nto be unjust if others were? I embarked my little savings in a concern\r\npresided over by one of them. I lost every penny of it; since then I\r\nhave never been able to save a penny.\"\r\n\r\nFélicien David was right--he never made money; first of all, \"because,\"\r\nas Auber said, \"he was too great an artist to be popular;\" secondly,\r\nbecause the era of cantatas and oratorios had not set in in France;\r\nthirdly, because he composed very slowly; and fourthly, \"because he had\r\nno luck.\" The performances of his principal theatrical work were\r\ninterrupted by the Coup-d'État. I am alluding to \"La Perle du Brésil,\"\r\nwhich, though represented at the Opéra-Comique in 1850, only ran for a\r\nfew nights there, divergencies of opinion having arisen between the\r\ncomposer and M. Émile Perrin, who was afterwards director of the Grand\r\nOpéra, and finally of the Comédie-Française. When it was revived, on\r\nNovember 22, 1851, the great event which was to transform the second\r\nrepublic into the second empire was looming on the horizon. In 1862,\r\nNapoléon III. made Félicien David an officer of the Légion d'Honneur;\r\nLouis-Philippe had bestowed the knighthood upon him in '46 or '47, after\r\na performance of his \"Christophe Colomb\" at the Tuileries. When Auber\r\nwas told of the honour conferred, he said, \"Napoléon is worse than the\r\nfish with the ring of Polycrates; it did not take him eleven years to\r\nbring it back.\" Alexandre Dumas opined that \"it was a pearl hid in a\r\ndunghill for a decade or more.\" When, towards the end of the Empire, a\r\nstreet near the projected opera building was named after Auber, and when\r\nhe could see his bust on the façade of the building, the scaffolding of\r\nwhich had been removed, Auber remarked that the Emperor had been good\r\nenough to give him credit. \"Now we are quits,\" he added, \"for he was\r\nDavid's debtor for eleven years. At any rate, I'll do my best to square\r\nthe account, so you need not order any hat-bands until '79.\" When '79\r\ncame, he had been in his tomb for nearly eight years.\r\n\r\nI wrote just now that Félicien David composed very slowly. But for this\r\ndefect, if it was one, Verdi would have never put his name to the score\r\nof \"Aïda.\" The musical encyclopedias will tell you that Signor\r\nGhislanzoni is the author of the libretto, and that the khedive applied\r\nto Signor Verdi for an opera on an Egyptian subject. The first part of\r\nthat statement is utterly untrue, the other part is but partially true.\r\nSignor Ghislanzoni is at best but the adapter in verse and translator of\r\nthe libretto. The original in prose is by M. Camille du Locle, founded\r\non the scenario supplied by Mariette-Bey, whom Ismaïl-Pasha had given\r\n_carte blanche_ with regard to the music and words. Mariette-Bey\r\nintended from the very first to apply to a French playwright, when one\r\nnight, being belated at Memphis in the Serapeum, and unable to return on\r\nfoot, he all at once remembered an old Egyptian legend. Next day he\r\ncommitted the scenario of it to paper, showed it to the khedive, and ten\r\ncopies of it were printed in Alexandria. One of these was sent to M. du\r\nLocle, who developed the whole in prose.\r\n\r\nM. du Locle had also been authorized to find a French composer, but it\r\nis very certain that Mariette-Bey had in his mind's eye the composer of\r\n\"Le Désert,\" though he may not have expressly said so. At any rate, M.\r\ndu Locle applied to David, who refused, although the \"retaining fee\" was\r\nfifty thousand francs. It was because he could not comply with the first\r\nand foremost condition, to have the score ready in six months at the\r\nlatest. Then Wagner was thought of. It is most probable that he would\r\nhave refused. To Mariette-Bey belongs the credit furthermore of having\r\nentirely stage-managed the opera.\r\n\r\nThus Félicien David, who had revealed \"the East in music\" to the\r\nEuropeans, no more reaped the fruits of his originality than Decamps,\r\nwho had revealed it in painting. Was not Auber right when he said to\r\nyoung Coquelin that the verdict on all things in this world might be\r\nsummed up in the one phrase, \"It's an injustice\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     Three painters, and a school for pifferari -- Gabriel Decamps,\r\n     Eugène Delacroix, and Horace Vernet -- The prices of pictures in\r\n     the forties -- Delacroix' find no purchasers at all -- Decamps'\r\n     drawings fetch a thousand francs each -- Decamps not a happy man\r\n     -- The cause of his unhappiness -- The man and the painter -- He\r\n     finds no pleasure in being popular -- Eugène Delacroix -- His\r\n     contempt for the bourgeoisie -- A parallel between Delacroix and\r\n     Shakespeare -- Was Delacroix tall or short? -- His love of\r\n     flowers -- His delicate health -- His personal appearance -- His\r\n     indifference to the love-passion -- George Sand and Delacroix --\r\n     A miscarried love-scene -- Delacroix' housekeeper, Jenny\r\n     Leguillou -- Delacroix does not want to pose as a model for one\r\n     of George Sand's heroes -- Delacroix as a writer -- His approval\r\n     of Carlyle's dictum, \"Show me how a man sings,\" etc. -- His\r\n     humour tempered by his reverence -- His failure as a caricaturist\r\n     -- His practical jokes on would-be art-critics -- Delacroix at\r\n     home -- His dress while at work -- Horace Vernet's, Paul\r\n     Delaroche's, Ingres' -- Early at work -- He does not waste time\r\n     over lunch -- How he spent his evenings -- His dislike of being\r\n     reproduced in marble or on canvas after his death -- Horace\r\n     Vernet -- The contrast between the two men and the two artists --\r\n     Vernet's appearance -- His own account of how he became a painter\r\n     -- Moral and mental resemblance to Alexandre Dumas père -- His\r\n     political opinions -- Vernet and Nicholas I. -- A bold answer --\r\n     His opinion on the mental state of the Romanoffs -- The comic\r\n     side of Vernet's character -- He thinks himself a Vauban -- His\r\n     interviews with M.

I had marked the prices\r\nrealized by a score or so of paintings signed by men who, though living\r\nat that time, were already more or less famous, and many of whom have\r\nsince then acquired a world-wide reputation. There was only one\r\nexception to this--that of Herrera the Elder, who had been dead nearly\r\ntwo centuries, and whose name was, and is still, a household word among\r\nconnoisseurs by reason of his having been the master of Velasquez. The\r\nhandiwork of the irascible old man was knocked down for three francs\r\nseventy-five centimes, though no question was raised as to the\r\ngenuineness of it in my hearing. It was a saint--the catalogue said no\r\nmore,--and I have been in vain trying to recollect why I did not buy it.\r\nThere must have been some cogent reason for my not having done so, for\r\n\"the frame was no doubt worth double the money,\" to use an auctioneer's\r\nphrase. Was it suspicion, or what? At any rate, two years later, I heard\r\nthat it had been sold to an American for fourteen thousand francs,\r\nthough, after all, that was no guarantee of its value.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 30: Written in 1882.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 31: The Hôtel Bullion was formerly the town mansion\r\n         of the financier of that name, and situated in the Rue\r\n         Coquillière.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIn those days it was certainly better to be a live artist than a dead\r\none, for, a little further on among these pages, I came upon a marginal\r\nnote of the prices fetched by three works of Meissonier, \"Le Corps de\r\nGarde,\" \"Une partie de piquet,\" and \"Un jeune homme regardant des\r\ndessins,\" all of which had been in the salon of that year,[32] and each\r\nof which fetched 3000 francs. I should not like to say what their\r\npurchasing price would be to-day, allowing for the difference in the\r\nvalue of money. Further on still, there is a note of a picture by Alfred\r\nde Dreux, which realized a similar amount. Allowing for that same\r\ndifference in the value of money, that work would probably not find a\r\nbuyer now among real connoisseurs at 200 francs.[33] At the same time,\r\nthe original sketch of David's \"Serment du Jeu de Paume\" did not find a\r\npurchaser at 2500 francs, the reserve price. A landscape by Jules André,\r\na far greater artist than Alfred de Dreux, went for 300 francs, and\r\nBaron's \"Oies du Frère Philippe\" only realized 200 francs more. There\r\nwas not a single \"bid\" for Eugène Delacroix' \"Marc-Aurèle,\" and when he\r\ndid sell a picture it was for 500 or 600 francs; nowadays it would fetch\r\n100,000 francs. On the other hand, the drawings of Decamps' admirable\r\n\"Histoire de Samson\" realized 1000 francs each.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 32: The annual salon was held in the Louvre then; in\r\n         1849 it was transferred to the Tuileries. In 1850, '51, and '52\r\n         it was removed to the galleries of the Palais-Royal; in 1853\r\n         and '54 the salon was held in the Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs, in\r\n         the Faubourg Poissonnière, which became afterwards the\r\n         storehouse for the scenery of the Grand Opéra. In 1855 the\r\n         exhibition took place in a special annex of the Palais de\r\n         l'Industrie; after that, it was lodged in the Palais\r\n         itself.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 33: Alfred de Dreux was not an unknown figure in\r\n         London society. He came in 1848. He was a kind of Comte\r\n         d'Orsay, and painted chiefly equestrian figures. After the Coup\r\n         d'État he returned to Paris, and was patronized by society, and\r\n         subsequently by Napoléon III. himself, whose portrait he\r\n         painted. He was killed in a duel, the cause of which has never\r\n         been revealed.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nYet Gabriel Decamps was a far unhappier man than Eugène Delacroix. The\r\npictures rejected by the public became the \"apples\" of Delacroix' eyes,\r\nwith which he would not part, subsequently, at any price, as in the case\r\nof his \"Marino Faliero.\" Decamps, one day, while he lived in the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Denis, deliberately destroyed one hundred and forty\r\ndrawings, the like of which were eagerly bought up for a thousand francs\r\napiece, though at present they would be worth four times that amount.\r\nDelacroix was content with his God-given genius; \"he saw everything he\r\nhad made, and behold it was very good,\" Decamps fumed and fretted at the\r\nsupposed systematic neglect of the Government, which did not give him a\r\ncommission. \"You paint with a big brush, but you are not a great\r\npainter,\" said Sir Joshua to a would-be Michael-Angelo. To Gabriel\r\nDecamps the idea of being allowed or invited by the State to cover a\r\nnumber of yards of canvas or wall or ceiling was so attractive that he\r\npositively lost his sleep and his appetite over it. It was, perhaps, the\r\nonly bitter drop in his otherwise tolerably full cup of happiness, but\r\nthat one drop very frequently embittered the whole. He had many good\r\ntraits in his character, though he was not uniformly good-tempered.\r\nThere was an absolute indifference as to the monetary results of his\r\ncalling, and an inherent generosity to those who \"had fallen by the\r\nway.\" But he was something of a bear and a recluse, not because he\r\ndisliked society, but because he deliberately suppressed his sociable\r\nqualities, lest he should arouse the suspicion of making them the\r\nstepping-stone to his ambition. No man ever misread the lesson, \"Do well\r\nand fear not,\" so utterly as did Decamps. He was never tired of\r\nwell-doing; and he was never tired of speculating what the world would\r\nthink of it. There is not a single picture from his brush that does not\r\ncontain an original thought; he founded an absolutely new school--no\r\nsmall thing to do. The world at large acknowledged as much, and yet he\r\nwould not enjoy the fruits of that recognition, because it lacked the\r\n\"official stamp.\" When Decamps consented to forget his real or fancied\r\ngrievances he became a capital companion, provided one had a taste for\r\nbitter and scathing satire. I fancy Jonathan Swift must have been\r\nsomething like Gabriel Decamps in his daily intercourse with his\r\nfamiliars. But he rarely said an ill-natured thing of his\r\nfellow-artists. His strictures were reserved for the political men of\r\nhis time, and of the preceding reign. The Bourbons he despised from the\r\nbottom of his heart, and during the Restauration his contempt found vent\r\nin caricatures which, at the moment, must have seared like a red-hot\r\niron. He had kept a good many of these ephemeral productions, and, I am\r\nbound to say, they struck one afterwards as unnecessarily severe. \"If\r\nthey\" (meaning the Bourbons) \"had continued to reign in France,\" he said\r\none day, \"I would have applied for letters of naturalization to the\r\nSultan.\"\r\n\r\nDecamps was killed, like Géricault, by a fall off his horse, but long\r\nbefore that he had ceased to work. \"I cannot add much to my reputation,\r\nand do not care to add to my store,\" he said. In 1855, the world\r\npositively rang with his name, but I doubt whether this universal\r\nadmiration gave him much satisfaction. He exhibited more than fifty\r\nworks at the Exposition Universelle of that year, a good many of which\r\nhad been rejected by the \"hanging committees\" of previous salons. True\r\nto his system, he rarely, perhaps never directly, called the past\r\njudgment in question, but he lived and died a dissatisfied man. Unlike\r\nMirabeau, who had not the courage to be unpopular, Decamps derived no\r\ngratification from popularity.\r\n\r\nI knew Eugène Delacroix better than any of the others in the marvellous\r\nconstellation of painters of that period, and our friendship lasted till\r\nthe day of his death, in December, 1863. I was also on very good terms\r\nwith Horace Vernet; but though the latter was perhaps a more lively\r\ncompanion, the stronger attraction was towards the former. I was one of\r\nthe few friends whom he tolerated whilst at work. Our friendship lasted\r\nfor nearly a quarter of a century, and during that time there was never\r\na single unpleasantness between us, though I am bound to admit that\r\nDelacroix' temper was very uncertain. Among all those men who had a\r\nprofound, ineradicable contempt for the bourgeois, I have only known one\r\nwho despised him even to a greater extent than he; it was Gustave\r\nFlaubert. Though Delacroix' manners were perfect, he could scarcely be\r\npolite to the middle classes. With the exception of Dante and\r\nShakespeare, Delacroix was probably the greatest poet that ever lived; a\r\ngreater poet undoubtedly than Victor Hugo, in that he was absolutely\r\nindifferent to the material results of his genius. If Shakespeare and\r\nthe author of the \"Inferno\" had painted, they would have painted like\r\nDelacroix; his \"Sardanapale\" is the Byronic poem, condensed and\r\ntransferred to canvas.\r\n\r\nLong as I knew Delacroix, I had never been able to make out whether he\r\nwas tall or short, and most of his friends and acquaintances were\r\nequally puzzled. As we stood around his coffin many were surprised at\r\nits length. His was decidedly a curious face, at times stony in its\r\nimmobility, at others quivering from the tip of chin to the juncture of\r\nthe eyebrows, and with a peculiar movement of the nostrils that was\r\nalmost pendulum-like in its regularity. It gave one the impression of\r\ntheir being assailed by some unpleasant smell, and, one day, when\r\nDelacroix was in a light mood, I remarked upon it. \"You are perfectly\r\nright,\" he replied; \"I always fancy there is corruption in the air, but\r\nit is not necessarily of a material kind.\"\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, he liked to surround himself with flowers, and his\r\nstudio was often like a hothouse, apart from the floral decorations. The\r\ntemperature was invariably very high, and even then he would shiver now\r\nand again. I have always had an idea that Delacroix had Indian blood in\r\nhis veins, which idea was justified to a certain extent by his\r\nappearance, albeit that there was no tradition to that effect in his\r\nfamily. But it was neither the black hair, the olive skin, nor the\r\npeculiar formation of the features which forced that conclusion upon me;\r\nit was the character of Delacroix, which for years and years I\r\nendeavoured to read thoroughly, without succeeding to any appreciable\r\ndegree. There was one trait that stood out so distinctly that the merest\r\nchild might have perceived it--his honesty; but the rest was apparently\r\na mass of contradiction. It is difficult to imagine a poet, and\r\nespecially a painter-poet, without an absorbing passion for some\r\nwoman--not necessarily for the same woman; to my knowledge Delacroix had\r\nno such passion, for one can scarcely admit that Jenny Leguillou, his\r\nhousekeeper, could have inspired such a feeling. True, when I first knew\r\nDelacroix he was over forty, but those who had known him at twenty and\r\ntwenty-five never hinted at any romantic attachment or even at a sober,\r\nhomely affection. And assuredly a man of forty is not invulnerable in\r\nthat respect. And yet, the woman who positively bewitched, one after\r\nanother, so many of Delacroix' eminent contemporaries, Jules Sandeau,\r\nAlfred de Musset, Michel de Bourges, Chopin, Pierre Leroux, Cabet,\r\nLammenais, etc., had no power over him.\r\n\r\nPaul de Musset, perhaps as a kind of revenge for the wrongs suffered by\r\nhis brother, once gave an amusing description of the miscarried attempt\r\nof George Sand \"to net\" Eugène Delacroix.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the painter had shown signs of yielding to the\r\ncharms which few men were able to withstand, or, at any rate, that\r\nGeorge Sand fancied she could detect such signs. Whether it was from a\r\nwish on George Sand's part to precipitate matters or to nip the thing in\r\nthe bud, it would be difficult to determine, but it is certain that she\r\npursued her usual tactics--that is, she endeavoured to provoke an\r\nadmission of her admirer's feeling. Though I subsequently ascertained\r\nthat Paul de Musset's story was substantially true, I am not altogether\r\nprepared, knowing his animosity against her, to accept his hinted theory\r\nof the lady's desire \"de brusquer les fiançailles.\"\r\n\r\nOne morning, then, while Delacroix was at work, George Sand entered his\r\nstudio. She looked out of spirits, and almost immediately stated the\r\npurpose of her visit.\r\n\r\n\"My poor Eugène!\" she began; \"I am afraid I have got sad news for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said Delacroix, without interrupting his work, and just\r\ngiving her one of his cordial smiles in guise of welcome.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear friend, I have carefully consulted my own heart, and the\r\nupshot is, I am grieved to tell you, that I feel I cannot and could\r\nnever love you.\"\r\n\r\nDelacroix kept on painting. \"Is that a fact?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I ask you once more to pardon me, and to give me credit for my\r\ncandour--my poor Delacroix.\"\r\n\r\nDelacroix did not budge from his easel.\r\n\r\n\"You are angry with me, are you not? You will never forgive me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I will. Only I want you to keep quiet for ten minutes; I have\r\ngot a bit of sky there which has caused me a good deal of trouble, it is\r\njust coming right. Go and sit down or else take a little walk, and come\r\nback in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, George Sand did not return; and equally, of course, did not\r\ntell the story to any one, but somehow it leaked out. Perhaps Jenny\r\nLeguillou had overheard the scene--she was quite capable of listening\r\nbehind a screen or door--and reporting it. Delacroix himself, when\r\n\"chaffed\" about it, never denied it. There was no need for him to do so,\r\nbecause theoretically it redounded to the lady's honour; had she not\r\nrejected his advances?\r\n\r\nI have noted it here to prove that the poetry of Delacroix n'allait pas\r\nse faufiler dans les jupons, because, though we would not take it for\r\ngranted that where George Sand failed others would have succeeded, it is\r\nnevertheless an authenticated fact that only one other man among the\r\nmany on whom she tried her wiles remained proof against them. That man\r\nwas Prosper Mérimée, the author of \"Colomba\" and \"Carmen,\" the friend of\r\nPanizzi. \"Quand je fais un roman, je choisis mon sujet; je ne veux pas\r\nque l'on me découpe pour en faire un. Madame Sand ne met pas ses amants\r\ndans son coeur, elle les mets dans ses livres; et elle le fait si\r\ndiablement vite qu'on n'a pas le temps de la devancer.\" Mérimée was\r\nright, each of George Sand's earlier books had been written with the\r\nheart's blood of one of the victims of her insatiable passions--for I\r\nshould not like to prostitute the word \"love\" to her liaisons; and I am\r\nglad to think that Eugène Delacroix was spared that ordeal. It would\r\nhave killed him; and the painter of \"Sardanapale\" was more precious to\r\nhis own art than to hers, which, with all due deference to eminent\r\ncritics, left an unpleasant sensation to those who were fortunate enough\r\nto be free from incipient hysteria.\r\n\r\nA liaison with George Sand would have killed Eugène Delacroix, I am\r\nperfectly certain; for he would have staked gold, she would have only\r\nplayed with counters. It would have been the vitiated atmosphere in\r\nwhich the cradle of his life and of his genius--which were one, in this\r\ninstance--would have been extinguished.\r\n\r\nAs it was, that candle burned very low at times, because, during the\r\nyears I knew Delacroix, he had nearly always one foot in the grave; the\r\nhealthy breezes of art's unpolluted air made that candle burn brightly\r\nnow and again; hence the difference in quality, as striking, of some of\r\nhis pictures.\r\n\r\nPerhaps on account of his delicate health, Delacroix was not very fond\r\nof society, in which, however, he was ever welcome, and particularly\r\nfitted to shine, though he rarely attempted to do so. I have said that\r\nDante and Shakespeare, if they had painted, would have painted as\r\nDelacroix did; I am almost tempted to add that if Delacroix' vocation\r\nhad impelled him that way, he would have sung as they sang--of course, I\r\ndo not mean that he would have soared as high, but his name would have\r\nlived in literature as it does in painting, though perhaps not with so\r\nbrilliant a halo around it. For, unlike many great painters of his time,\r\nDelacroix was essentially lettré. One has but to read some of his\r\ncritical essays in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ of that period, to be\r\nconvinced of that at once. Théophile Gautier said, one evening, that it\r\nwas \"the style of a poet in a hurry.\" The sentences give one the\r\nimpression of newly-minted golden coins. Nearly every one contains a\r\nthought, which, if reduced to small change, would still make an\r\nadmirable paragraph. He gives to his readers what he expects from his\r\nauthors--a sensation, a shock in two or three lines. The sentences are\r\nmodelled upon his favourite prose author, who, curious to relate, was\r\nnone other than Napoléon I. I often tried to interest him in English\r\nliterature. Unfortunately, he knew no English to speak of, and was\r\nobliged to have recourse to translations. Walter Scott he thought\r\nlong-winded, and, after a few attempts at Shakespeare in French, he gave\r\nit up. \"Ça ne peut pas être cela,\" he said. But he had several French\r\nversions of \"Gulliver's Travels,\" all of which he read in turn. One day,\r\nI quoted to him a sentence from Carlyle's \"Lectures on Heroes:\" \"Show me\r\nhow a man sings, and I will tell you how he will fight.\" \"C'est cela,\"\r\nhe said; \"if Shakespeare had been a general, he would have won his\r\nbattles like Napoléon, by thunderclaps\" (par des coups de foudre).\r\n\r\nDelacroix had what a great many Frenchmen lack--a keen sense of humour,\r\nbut it was considerably tempered by what, for the want of a better term,\r\nI may call the bump of reverence. He could not be humorous at the\r\nexpense of those he admired or respected, consequently his attempts at\r\ncaricature at the early period of his career in _Le Nain Jaune_ were a\r\nfailure; because Delacroix' admiration and respect were not necessarily\r\nreserved for those with whom he agreed in art or politics, but for\r\neveryone who attempted something great or useful, though he failed. The\r\nman who, at the age of sixty, would enthusiastically dilate upon his\r\nmeeting forty years before with Gros, whose hat he had knocked off by\r\naccident, was not the likely one to hold up to ridicule the celebrity of\r\nthe hour or day _without_ malice prepense. And this malice prepense\r\nnever uprose within him, except in the presence of some bumptious,\r\nignorant nobody. Then it positively boiled over, and he did not mind\r\nwhat trick he played his interlocutor. The latter might be a wealthy\r\nwould-be patron, an influential Government official, or a well-known\r\npicture-dealer; it was all the same to Delacroix, who had an utter\r\ncontempt for patronage, nepotism, and money. It was as good as a clever\r\nscene in a comedy to see him rise and draw himself up to his full\r\nheight, in order to impress his victim with a sense of the importance of\r\nwhat he was going to say. To get an idea of him under such\r\ncircumstances, one must go and see his portrait in the Louvre, painted\r\nby himself, with the semi-supercilious, semi-benevolent smile playing\r\nupon the parted lips, and showing the magnificent regular set of teeth,\r\nof which he was very proud, beneath the black bushy moustache, which\r\nreminds one curiously of that of Rembrandt. Of course, the victim was\r\nmesmerized, and stood listening with all attention, promising himself to\r\nremember every word of the spoken essay on art, with the view of\r\nproducing it as his own at the first favourable opportunity. And he\r\ngenerally did, to his own discomfiture and the amusement of his hearers,\r\nwho, if they happened to know Delacroix, which was the case frequently,\r\ninvariably detected the source of the speaker's information. I once\r\nheard a spoken essay on Holbein reproduced in that way, which would have\r\nsimply made the fortune of any comic writer. The human parrot had not\r\neven been parrot-like, for he had muddled the whole in transmission. I\r\ntook some pains to reproduce his exact words, and I never saw Delacroix\r\nlaugh as when I repeated it to him. For, as a rule, and even when he was\r\nmystifying that kind of numskull in the presence of half a dozen\r\nwell-informed friends, Delacroix remained perfectly serious, though the\r\nothers had to bite their lips lest they should explode. In fact, it\r\nwould have been difficult at any time to guess or discover, beneath the\r\nwell-bred man of the world, with his charming, courtly, though somewhat\r\ndistant manner, the painter who gave us \"La Barque de Dante,\" and \"Les\r\nMassacres de Scio;\" still, Delacroix was that man of the world,\r\nexceedingly careful of his appearance, particular to a degree about his\r\nnails, which he wore very long, dressed to perfection, and, in spite of\r\nthe episode with George Sand, recorded above, most ingratiating with\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nDifferent altogether was he in his studio. Though he was \"at home\" from\r\nthree till five, to visitors of both sexes, it was distinctly understood\r\nthat he would not interrupt his work for them, or play the host as the\r\npopular painter of to-day is supposed to do. The atelier, encumbered\r\nwith bric-à-brac and sumptuous hangings and afternoon tea, had not been\r\ninvented: if the host wore a velvet coat, a Byronic collar, and gorgeous\r\npapooshes, it was because he liked these things himself, not because he\r\nintended to impress his visitors. As a rule, the host, though in his\r\nyouth perhaps he had been fond of extravagant costumes, did not like\r\nthem: Horace Vernet often worked in his shirt-sleeves, Paul Delaroche\r\nnearly always wore a blouse, and Ingres, until he became \"a society\r\nman,\" which was very late in life, donned a dressing-gown. Delacroix\r\nwas, if anything, more slovenly than the rest when at work. An old\r\njacket buttoned up to the chin, a large muffler round his neck, a cloth\r\ncap pulled over his ears, and a pair of thick felt slippers made up his\r\nusual garb. For he was nearly always shivering with cold, and had an\r\naffection of the throat, besides, which compelled him to be careful.\r\n\"But for my wrapping up, I should have been dead at thirty,\" he said.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, at the stroke of eight, winter and summer, he was in his\r\nstudio, which he did not leave until dark, during six months of the\r\nyear, and a little before, during the other six. Contrary to the French\r\nhabit, he never took luncheon, and generally dined at home a little\r\nafter six--the fatigue of dining out being too much for him.\r\n\r\nI may safely say that I was one of Delacroix' friends, with whom he\r\ntalked without restraint. I often went to him of an evening when the\r\nweather prevented his going abroad, which, in his state of health, was\r\nvery often. He always chafed at such confinement; for though not fond of\r\nsociety in a general way, he liked coming to the Boulevards, after his\r\nwork was over, and mixing with his familiars. Delacroix smoked, but,\r\nunlike many addicted to tobacco, could not sit idle. His hands, as well\r\nas his brain, wanted to be busy; consequently, when imprisoned by rain\r\nor snow, he sat sketching figures or groups, talking all the while. By\r\nthen his name had become familiar to every art student throughout the\r\nworld, and he often received flattering letters from distant parts. One\r\nevening, shortly after the death of David d'Angers, to an episode in\r\nwhose life I have devoted a considerable space in these notes, Delacroix\r\nreceived an American newspaper, the title of which I have forgotten, but\r\nwhich contained an exceedingly able article on the great sculptor, as an\r\nartist, and as a man. It wound up with the question, \"And what kind of\r\nmonument will be raised to him by the man who virtually shortened his\r\nlife by sending him into exile, because David remained true to the\r\nrepublican principles which Napoléon only shammed--or, if not shammed,\r\ndeliberately trod underfoot to ascend a tyrant's throne?\"\r\n\r\nI translated the whole of the article, and, when I came to the last\r\nlines, Delacroix shook his head sadly. \"You remember,\" he said, \"the\r\nanswer of our friend Dumas, when they asked him for a subscription\r\ntowards a monument to a man whom every one had reviled in the beginning\r\nof his career. 'They had better be content with the stones they threw at\r\nhim during his existence. No monument they can raise will be so eloquent\r\nof their imbecility and his genius.' I may take it,\" he went on, \"that\r\nsuch a question will be raised one day after my death, perhaps many\r\nyears after I am gone. If you are alive you will, by my will, raise your\r\nvoice against the project. I have painted my own portrait; while I am\r\nhere, I will take care that it be not reproduced; I will forbid them to\r\ndo so after I am at rest. There shall not be a bust on my tomb.\"\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight before his death he made a will to that effect, and up\r\nto the present hour (1883) its injunctions have been respected.\r\nDelacroix lies in a somewhat solitary spot in Père-Lachaise. Neither\r\nemblem, bust, nor statue adorns his tomb, which was executed according\r\nto his own instructions. \"They libelled me so much during my life,\" he\r\nsaid one day, \"that I do not want them to libel me after my death, on\r\ncanvas or in marble. They flattered me so much afterwards, that I knew\r\ntheir flattery to be fulsome, and, if anything, I am more afraid of it\r\nthan of their libels.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find a greater contrast than there existed\r\nbetween Eugène Delacroix, both as a man and an artist, and Horace\r\nVernet. The one loved his art with the passionate devotion of an\r\nintensely poetical lover for his wayward mistress, whom to cease wooing\r\nfor a moment might mean an irreparable breach or, at least, a long\r\nestrangement; the other loved his with the calm affection of the\r\ncherished husband for the faithful wife who had blessed him with a\r\nnumerous offspring, whom he had known from his very infancy, a marriage\r\nwith whom had been decided upon when he was a mere lad, whom he might\r\neven neglect for a little while without the bond being in any way\r\nrelaxed. According to their respective certificates of birth, Vernet was\r\nthe senior by ten years of Delacroix. When I first knew them, about\r\n1840, Vernet looked ten years younger than Delacroix. If they had chosen\r\nto disguise themselves as musketeers of the Louis XIII. period, Vernet\r\nwould have reminded one of both Aramis and d'Artagnan; Delacroix, of\r\nAthos.\r\n\r\nMontaigne spoke Latin before he could speak French; Vernet drew men and\r\nhorses before he had mastered either French or Latin. His playthings\r\nwere stumpy, worn-out brushes, discarded palettes, and sticks of\r\ncharcoal; his alphabet, the pictures of the Louvre, where his father\r\noccupied a set of apartments, and where he was born, a month before the\r\noutbreak of the first Revolution. He once said to me, \"Je suis peintre\r\ncomme il y des hommes qui sont rois--parceque ils ne peuvent pas être\r\nautre chose. Il fallait un homme de génie pour sortir d'un pareil\r\nbourbier et malheureusement je n'ai que du talent.\" By the \"bourbier\" he\r\nmeant his great-grandfather, his two grandfathers, and his father, all\r\nof whom were painters and draughtsmen.\r\n\r\nPosterity will probably decide whether Horace Vernet was a genius or\r\nmerely a painter of great talent, but it will scarcely convey an\r\napproximate idea of the charm of the man himself. There was only one\r\nother of his contemporaries who exercised the same spell on his\r\ncompanions--Alexandre Dumas _père_. Though Vernet was a comparative\r\ndwarf by the side of Dumas, the men had the same qualities, physical,\r\nmoral, and mental. Neither of them knew what bodily fatigue meant; both\r\ncould work for fourteen or fifteen hours a day for a fortnight or a\r\nmonth; both would often have \"a long bout of idleness,\" as they called\r\nit, which, to others not endowed with their strength and mental\r\nactivity, would have meant hard labour. Both were fond of earning money,\r\nfonder still of spending it; both created almost without an effort.\r\nDumas roared with laughter while writing; Vernet sang at the top of his\r\nvoice while painting, or bandied jokes with his visitors, who might come\r\nand go as they liked at all hours. Dumas, especially in the earlier days\r\nof his career, had to read a great deal before he could catch the local\r\ncolour of his novels and plays--he himself has told us that he was\r\naltogether ignorant of the history of France. But when he had finished\r\nreading up the period in question, he wrote as if he had been born in\r\nit. Vernet was a walking cyclopædia on military costume; he knew,\r\nperhaps, not much more than that, but that he knew thoroughly, and never\r\nhad to think twice about the uniforms of his models, and, as he himself\r\nsaid, \"I never studied the thing, nor did I learn to paint or to draw.\r\nAccording to many people, I do not know how to paint or to draw now: it\r\nmay be so; at any rate I have the comfort of having wasted nobody's time\r\nin trying to learn.\"\r\n\r\nLike Dumas, he was very proud of his calling and of the name he had made\r\nfor himself in it, which he would not have changed for the title of\r\nemperor--least of all for that of king; for, like his great\r\ncontemporary, he was a republican at heart. It did not diminish either\r\nhis or Dumas' admiration for Napoléon I. \"I can understand an absolute\r\nmonarchy, nay, a downright autocracy, and I can understand a republic,\"\r\nsaid Vernet, \"but I fail to understand the use of a constitutional king,\r\njust because it implies and entails the principle of succession by\r\ninheritance. An autocracy means one ruler over so many millions of\r\nsubjects; a constitutional monarchy means between five and six hundred\r\ndirect rulers, so many millions of indirect ones, and one subject who is\r\ncalled king. Who would leave his child the inheritance of such slavery?\r\nÀ la bonne heure, give me a republic such as we understand it in France,\r\nall rulers, all natural-born kings, gods in mortals' disguise who dance\r\nto the piping of the devil. There have been two such since I was born;\r\nthere may be another half-dozen like these within the next two\r\ncenturies, because, before you can have an ideal republic, you must have\r\nideal republicans, and Nature cannot afford to fritter away her most\r\nprecious gifts on a lot of down-at-heels lawyers and hobnail-booted\r\nscum. She condescends now and then to make an ideal tyrant--she will\r\nnever make a nation of ideal republicans. You may just as well ask her\r\nto make a nation of Raffaelles or Michael Angelos, or Shakespeares or\r\nMolières.\"\r\n\r\nBoth men, in spite of their republican opinions, were personally\r\nattached to some members of the Orléans family; both had an almost\r\ninvincible objection to the Bourbons. Vernet had less occasion to be\r\noutspoken in his dislike than Dumas, but he refused to receive the Duc\r\nde Berri when the latter offered to come and see the battle-pieces\r\nVernet was painting for the then Duke of Orléans (Louis-Philippe).\r\nVernet had stipulated that his paintings should illustrate exclusively\r\nthe campaigns of the first Republic and the Empire, though subsequently\r\nhe depicted some episodes of the Algerian wars, in which the son of the\r\nking had distinguished himself. \"Tricolour cockades or no pictures,\" he\r\nremarked, and Louis-Philippe good-humouredly acquiesced. Though\r\ncourteous to a degree, he never minced matters to either king or beggar.\r\nWhile in Russia Nicholas took a great fancy to him. It appears that the\r\npainter, who must have looked even smaller by the side of the Czar than\r\nhe did by that of Dumas, had accompanied the former, if not on a\r\nperilous, at least on a very uncomfortable journey in the middle of the\r\nwinter. He and the Emperor were the only two men who had borne the\r\nhardships and privations without grumbling, nay, with Mark Tapleyean\r\ncheerfulness. That kind of fortitude was at all times a passport to\r\nNicholas' heart, doubly so in this instance, by reason of Vernet's by no\r\nmeans robust appearance. From that moment Nicholas became very attached\r\nto, and would often send for, him. They would often converse on subjects\r\neven more serious, and, one day, after the partition of Poland, Nicholas\r\nproposed that Vernet should paint a picture on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I cannot do it, sire,\" was the answer. \"I have never\r\npainted a Christ on the cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"The moment I had said it,\" continued Vernet, when he told me the story,\r\nwhich is scarcely known, \"I thought my last hour had struck. I am\r\npositively certain that a Russian would have paid these words with his\r\nlife, or at least with lifelong exile to Siberia. I shall never forget\r\nthe look he gave me; there was a murderous gleam in the eyes; but it was\r\nover in an instant. Nevertheless, I feel convinced that Nicholas was\r\nmad, and, what is more, I feel equally convinced that there is incipient\r\nmadness throughout the whole of the Romanoff family. I saw a good many\r\nof its members during my stay in Russia. They all did and said things\r\nwhich would have landed ordinary men and women in a lunatic asylum. At\r\nthe same time there was an unmistakable touch of genius about some of\r\nthem. I often endeavoured to discuss the matter with the resident\r\nforeign physicians, but, as you may imagine, they were very reticent.\r\nBut mark my words, one day there will be a terrible flare-up. Of course,\r\nthe foreigner, who sees the superstitious reverence, the slavish respect\r\nwith which they are surrounded, scarcely wonders that these men and\r\nwomen should, in the end, consider themselves above, and irresponsible\r\nto, the millions of grovelling mortals whom they rule; in spite of all\r\nthis, the question can only be one of time, and when the Russian empire\r\nfalls, the cataclysm will be unlike any other that has preceded it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a comic side to Horace Vernet's character. By dint of painting\r\nbattle-pieces he had come to consider himself an authority on strategy\r\nand tactics, and his criticisms on M. Thiers' system of fortifications\r\nused to set us roaring. I am under the impression--though I will not\r\nstrictly vouch for it--that at the recommendation of one or two of the\r\ninveterate jokers of our set, Laurent-Jan[34] and Méry, he had a couple\r\nof interviews with M. Theirs, but we never ascertained the result of\r\nthem. It was almost certain that the minister of Louis-Philippe, who at\r\none period of his life considered himself a Napoléon and a Vauban rolled\r\ninto one, did not entertain Vernet's suggestions with the degree of\r\nenthusiasm to which he thought them entitled; at any rate, from that\r\ntime, the mention of M. Thiers' name generally provoked a contemptuous\r\nshrug of the shoulders on Vernet's part. \"C'est tout à fait comme\r\nNapoléon et Jomini, mon cher Vernet,\" said Laurent-Jan; \"mais, après\r\ntout, qu'est que cela vous fait? La postérité jugera entre vous deux,\r\nelle saura bien débrouiller la part que vous avez contribuée à ces\r\ntravaux immortels.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 34: Laurent-Jan was a witty, though incorrigibly idle\r\n         journalist. He is entirely forgotten now save by such men as\r\n         MM. Arsène Houssaye and Roger de Beauvoir, who were his\r\n         contemporaries. He was the author of a clever parody on\r\n         Kotzebue's \"Menschenhasz und Reue,\" known on the English stage\r\n         as \"The Stranger.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nMuch as Horace Vernet admired his great contemporaries in art and\r\nliterature, his greatest worship was reserved for Alfred de Vigny, the\r\nsoldier-poet, though the latter was by no means a sympathetic companion.\r\nNext to his society, which was rarely to be had, he preferred that of\r\nArthur Bertrand, the son of Napoléon's companion in exile. Arthur\r\nBertrand had an elder brother, Napoléon Bertrand, who, at the storming\r\nof Constantine, put on a new pair of white kid gloves, brought from\r\nParis for the purpose. Horace Vernet made at least fifty sketches of\r\nthat particular incident, but he never painted the picture. \"I could\r\nnot do it justice,\" he said, when remonstrated with for his\r\nprocrastination. \"I should fail to realize the grandeur of the thing.\"\r\nThereupon Laurent-Jan, who had no bump of reverence, proposed a poem in\r\nso many cantos, to be illustrated by Vernet. I give the plan as\r\ndeveloped by the would-be author.\r\n\r\n1. The kid in its ancestral home among the mountains. A mysterious voice\r\nfrom heaven tells it that its skin will be required for a pair of\r\ngloves. The kid objects, and inquires why the skin of some other kid\r\nwill not do as well. The voice reveals the glorious purpose of the\r\ngloves. The kid consents, and at the same moment a hunter appears in\r\nsight. The kid, instead of taking to its heels, assumes a favourable\r\nposition to be shot. It makes a dying speech.\r\n\r\n2. A glove-shop on the Boulevard. Enter Napoléon Bertrand, asking for a\r\npair of gloves. The girl tells him that she has only one pair left, and\r\ncommunicates the legend connected with it. The price is twenty francs.\r\nNapoléon Bertrand demurs at it, and tells her, in his turn, what the\r\ngloves are wanted for. The girl refuses to take the money, and her\r\nemployer, overhearing the conversation, dismisses her there and then. He\r\nkeeps the wages due to her as the price of the gloves. Napoléon Bertrand\r\nputs the latter in his pocket, offers the girl his arm, and invites her\r\nto breakfast in a _cabinet particulier_, \"en tout bien, en tout\r\nhonneur.\" To prove his perfectly honourable intentions, he tells her the\r\nstory of Jeanne d'Arc. The girl's imagination is fired by the recital,\r\nand after luncheon she goes in search of a book on the subject. An\r\nunscrupulous, dishonest second-hand bookseller palms off an edition of\r\nVoltaire's \"La Pucelle.\" The girl writes to Napoléon Bertrand to tell\r\nhim that he has made a fool of her, that Jeanne d'Arc was no better than\r\nshe should be, and that she is going to join the harem of the Bey of\r\nConstantine.\r\n\r\n3. Napoléon Bertrand stricken with remorse before Constantine. Orders\r\ngiven for the assault. Napoléon Bertrand looks for his gloves, and finds\r\nthat they are too small. He can just get them on, but cannot grasp the\r\nhandle of his sword. His servant announces a mysterious stranger, a\r\nveiled female stranger. She is admitted; she has made her escape from\r\nthe harem; a mysterious voice from heaven--the same that spoke to the\r\nkid--having warned her the night before that the gloves would be too\r\nsmall, and that she was to let a piece in. Reconciliation. Tableau. The\r\nbugles are sounding \"boot and saddle.\" Storming of Constantine.\r\n\r\nI have reproduced the words of Laurent-Jan; I will not attempt to\r\nreproduce his manner, which was simply inimitable. Horace Vernet and\r\nArthur Bertrand shook with laughter, and the latter offered Laurent-Jan\r\nto keep him for a twelvemonth if he would write the poem. Jan consented,\r\nand lived upon the fat of the land during that time, but the poem never\r\nsaw the light.\r\n\r\nArthur Bertrand was one of the most jovial fellows of his time. He,\r\nEugène Sue, and Latour-Mézerai were the best customers of the florist on\r\nthe Boulevards. It was he who accompanied the Prince de Joinville to St.\r\nHelena to bring back the remains of Napoléon. After their return a new\r\nfigure joined our set now and then. It was the Abbé Coquereau, the\r\nchaplain of \"La Belle-Poule.\" The Abbé Coquereau was the first French\r\nCatholic priest who discarded the gown and the shovel hat, and adopted\r\nthat of the English clergy. He was a charming man, and by no means\r\nstraight-laced, but he drew the line at accompanying Arthur in his\r\nnightly perambulations. One evening he, Arthur Bertrand, and Alexandre\r\nDumas were strolling along the Boulevards when the latter tried to make\r\nthe abbé enter the Variétés. The abbé held firm, or rather took to his\r\nheels.\r\n\r\nIn those days there were still a great many veterans of the _grande\r\narmée_ about, and a great deal of Horace Vernet's money went in\r\nentertaining them at the various cafés and restaurants--especially when\r\nhe was preparing sketches for a new picture. The ordinary model, clever\r\nand eminently useful as he was at that period, was willingly discarded\r\nfor the old and bronzed warrior of the Empire, some of whom were even\r\nthen returning from Africa. \"They may just as well earn the money I pay\r\nthe others,\" he said; consequently it was not an unusual thing to see a\r\ngeneral, a couple of colonels, half a dozen captains, and as many\r\nsergeants and privates, all of whom had served under Napoléon, in\r\nVernet's studio at the same time. Of course, the officers were only too\r\npleased to give their services gratuitously, but Vernet had a curious\r\nway of making up his daily budget. Twenty models at four francs--for\r\nmodels earned no more then--eighty francs. Fifteen of them refused their\r\npay. The eighty francs to be divided between five. And the five veterans\r\nenjoyed a magnificent income for weeks and weeks at a time.\r\n\r\nTruth compels me to state, however, that during those weeks \"the careful\r\nmother could not have taken her daughter\" to Vernet's studio. A couple\r\nof live horses, not unfrequently three, an equal number of stuffed ones,\r\ncamp kettles, broken limbers, pieces of artillery, an overturned\r\nammunition waggon, a collection of uniforms, that would have made the\r\nfortune of a costumier, scattered all over the place; drums, swords,\r\nguns and saddles: and, amidst this confusion, a score of veterans, some\r\nof whom had been comrades-in-arms and who seemed oblivious, for the time\r\nbeing, of their hard-earned promotion in the company of those who had\r\nbeen less lucky than they, every man smoking his hardest and telling his\r\nbest garrison story: all these made up a scene worthy of Vernet himself,\r\nbut somewhat appalling to the civilian who happened to come upon it\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nVernet was never happier than when at work under such circumstances.\r\nPerched on a movable scaffolding or on a high ladder, he reminded one\r\nmuch more of an acrobat than of a painter. Like Dumas, he could work\r\namidst a very Babel of conversation, but the sound of music, however\r\ngood, disturbed him. In those days, itinerant Italian musicians and\r\npifferari, who have disappeared from the streets of Paris altogether\r\nsince the decree of expulsion of '81, were numerous, and grew more\r\nnumerous year by year. I, for one, feel sorry for their disappearance,\r\nfor I remember having spent half a dozen most delightful evenings\r\nlistening to them.\r\n\r\nThe thing happened in this way. Though my regular visits to the\r\nQuartier-Latin had ceased long ago, I returned now and then to my old\r\nhaunts during the years '63 and '64, in company of a young Englishman\r\nwho was finishing his medical studies in Paris, who had taken up his\r\nquarters on the left bank of the Seine, and who has since become a\r\nphysician in very good practice in the French capital. He had been\r\nspecially recommended to me, and I was not too old to enjoy an evening\r\nonce a week or a fortnight among my juniors. At a café, which has been\r\ndemolished since to make room for a much more gorgeous establishment at\r\nthe corners of the Boulevards Saint-Michel and Saint-Germain, we used to\r\nnotice an elderly gentleman, scrupulously neat and exquisitely clean,\r\nthough his clothes were very threadbare. He always sat at the same table\r\nto the right of the counter. His cup of coffee was eked out by frequent\r\nsupplements of water, and meanwhile he was always busy copying music--at\r\nleast, so it seemed to us at first. We soon came to a different\r\nconclusion, though, because every now and then he would put down his\r\npen, lean back against the cushioned seat, look up at the ceiling and\r\nsmile to himself--such a sweet smile; the smile of a poet or an artist,\r\nseeking inspiration from the spirits supposed to be hovering now and\r\nthen about such.\r\n\r\nThat man was no copyist, but an obscure, unappreciated genius, perhaps,\r\nbiding his chance, hoping against hope, meanwhile living a life of\r\njealously concealed dreams and hardship. For he looked sad enough at the\r\nbest of times, with a kind of settled melancholy which apparently only\r\none thing could dispel--the advent of a couple or trio of pifferari.\r\nThen his face would light up all of a sudden, he would gently push his\r\nmusic away, speak to them in Italian, asking them to play certain\r\npieces, beating time with an air of contentment which was absolutely\r\ntouching to behold. On the other hand, the young pifferari appeared to\r\ntreat him with greater deference than they did the other customers; the\r\nlittle girl who accompanied them was particularly eager for his\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nIn a little while we became very friendly with the old gentleman, and,\r\none evening, he said, \"If you will be here next Wednesday, the pifferari\r\nwill give us something new.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening in question he looked quite smart; he had evidently \"fait\r\ndes frais de toilette,\" as our neighbours have it; he wore a different\r\ncoat, and his big white neckcloth was somewhat more starched than usual.\r\nHe seemed quite excited. The pifferari, on the other hand, seemed\r\nanxious and subdued. The café was very full, for all the habitués liked\r\nthe old gentleman, and had made it a point of responding to his\r\nquasi-invitation. They were well rewarded, for I have rarely heard\r\nsweeter music. It was unlike anything we were accustomed to hear from\r\nsuch musicians; there was an old-world sound about it that went straight\r\nto the heart, and when we looked at the old gentleman amidst the genuine\r\napplause after the termination of the first piece, there were two big\r\ntears coursing down his wrinkled cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe pifferari came again and again, and though they never appealed to\r\nhim directly, we instinctively guessed that there existed some\r\nconnection between them. All our efforts to get at the truth of the\r\nmatter were, however, in vain, for the old gentleman was very reticent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my young friend had passed his examinations, and shifted his\r\nquarters to my side of the river. He did not abandon the Quartier-Latin\r\naltogether, but my inquiries about the old musician met with no\r\nsatisfactory response. He had disappeared. Nearly two years went by,\r\nwhen, one afternoon, he called. \"Come with me,\" he said; \"I am going to\r\nshow you a curious nook of Paris which you do not know, and take you to\r\nan old acquaintance whom you will be pleased to see again.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"curious nook\" of Paris still exists to a certain extent, only the\r\npifferari have disappeared from it. It is situated behind the Panthéon,\r\nand is more original than its London counterpart--Saffron Hill. It is\r\nlike a corner of old Rome, Florence, or Naples, without the glorious\r\nItalian sun shining above it to lend picturesqueness to the rags and\r\ntatters of its population; swarthy desperadoes with golden rings in\r\ntheir ears and on their grimy fingers, their greasy, soft felt hats\r\ncocked jauntily on their heads, or drawn over the flashing dark eyes,\r\nbefore which their womankind cower and shake; old men who but for the\r\nstubble on their chins would look like ancient cameos; girls with\r\nshapely limbs and handsome faces; middle-aged women who remind one of\r\nthe witches in Macbeth; women younger still, who have neither shape nor\r\nmake; urchins and little lassies who remind one of the pictures of\r\nMurillo; in short, a population of wood-carvers and modellers, vendors\r\nof plaster casts, artist-models, sugar-bakers and mosaic-workers, living\r\nin the streets the greater part of the day, retiring to their wretched\r\nattics at night, sober and peaceful generally, but desperate and\r\nunmanageable when in their cups.\r\n\r\nThe cab stopped before a six-storied house which had seen better days,\r\nin a dark, narrow street, into which the light of day scarcely\r\npenetrated. The moment we alighted we heard a charivari of string\r\ninstruments and voices, and as we ascended the steep, slimy, rickety\r\nstaircase the sound grew more distinct. When we reached the topmost\r\nlanding, my friend knocked at one of the three or four doors, and,\r\nwithout waiting for an answer, we entered. It was a scantily furnished\r\nroom with a bare brick floor, an old bedstead in one corner, a few\r\nrush-bottomed chairs, and a deal table; but everything was scrupulously\r\nclean. Behind the table, a cotton nightcap on his head, his tall thin\r\nframe wrapt in an old overcoat, stood our old friend, the composer; in\r\nfront, half a dozen urchins, in costumes vaguely resembling those of the\r\nCalabrian peasantry, grimy like coalheavers, their black hair standing\r\non end with attention, were rehearsing a new piece of music. Then I\r\nunderstood it all. He was the professor of pifferari, an artist for all\r\nthat, an unappreciated genius, perhaps, who, rather than not be heard at\r\nall, introduced a composition of his own into their hackneyed programme,\r\nand tasted the sweets of popularity, without the accompanying rewards\r\nwhich, nowadays, popularity invariably brings. This one had known\r\nPaisiello and Rossini, had been in the thick of the excitement on the\r\nfirst night of the \"Barbière,\" and had dreamt of similar triumphs.\r\nPerhaps his genius was as much entitled to them as that of the others,\r\nbut he had loved not wisely, but too well, and when he awoke from the\r\nlove-dream, he was too ruined in body and mind to be able to work for\r\nthe realization of the artistic one. He would accept no aid. Three years\r\nlater, we carried him to his grave. A simple stone marks the place in\r\nthe cemetery of Montparnasse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     Louis-Philippe and his family -- An unpublished theatrical skit\r\n     on his mania for shaking hands with every one -- His art of\r\n     governing, according to the same skit -- Louis-Philippe not the\r\n     ardent admirer of the bourgeoisie he professed to be -- The\r\n     Faubourg Saint-Germain deserts the Tuileries -- The English in\r\n     too great a majority -- Lord ----'s opinion of the dinners at the\r\n     Tuileries -- The attitude of the bourgeoisie towards\r\n     Louis-Philippe, according to the King himself -- Louis-Philippe's\r\n     wit -- His final words on the death of Talleyrand -- His love of\r\n     money -- He could be generous at times -- A story of the\r\n     Palais-Royal -- Louis-Philippe and the Marseillaise -- Two\r\n     curious stories connected with the Marseillaise -- Who was the\r\n     composer of it? -- Louis-Philippe's opinion of the throne, the\r\n     crown, and the sceptre of France as additions to one's comfort --\r\n     His children, and especially his sons, take things more easily --\r\n     Even the Bonapartists admired some of the latter -- A mot of an\r\n     Imperialist -- How the boys were brought up -- Their nocturnal\r\n     rambles later on -- The King himself does not seem to mind those\r\n     escapades, but is frightened at M.

Neither\r\nthey nor I have ever been able to establish a sufficiently valid\r\npolitical cause for that upheaval. Perhaps it was because we were free\r\nfrom the prejudices engendered by what, for want of a better term, I\r\nmust call \"dynastic sentiment.\" We were not blind to the faults of\r\nLouis-Philippe, but we refused to look at them through the spectacles\r\nsupplied in turns by the Legitimists, the Imperialists, and Republicans.\r\nHow far these spectacles were calculated to improve people's vision, the\r\nfollowing specimen will show.\r\n\r\nI have lying before me a few sheets of quarto paper, sewn together in a\r\nprimitive way. It is a manuscript skit, in the form of a theatrical\r\nduologue, professing to deal with the king's well-known habit of shaking\r\nhands with every one with whom he came in contact. The _dramatis\r\npersonæ_ are King Fip I., Roi des Épiciers--read, King of the\r\nPhilistines or Shopkeepers, and his son and heir, Grand Poulot (Big\r\nSpooney). The monarch is giving the heir-apparent a lesson in the art of\r\ngoverning. \"Do not be misled,\" he says, \"by a parcel of theorists, who\r\nwill tell you that the citizen-monarchy is based upon the sovereign will\r\nof the people, or upon the strict observance of the Charter; this is\r\nmerely so much drivel from the political Rights or Lefts. In reality, it\r\ndoes not signify a jot whether France be free at home and feared and\r\nrespected abroad, whether the throne be hedged round with republican\r\ninstitutions or supported by an hereditary peerage, whether the language\r\nof her statesmen be weighty and the deeds of her soldiers heroic. The\r\ncitizen-monarchy and the art of governing consist of but one thing--the\r\ncapacity of the principal ruler for shaking hands with any and every\r\nragamuffin and out-of-elbows brute he meets.\" Thereupon King Fip shows\r\nhis son how to shake hands in every conceivable position--on foot, on\r\nhorseback, at a gallop, at a trot, leaning out of a carriage, and so\r\nforth. Grand Poulot is not only eager to learn, but ambitious to improve\r\nupon his sire's method. \"How would it do, dad,\" he asks, \"if, in\r\naddition to shaking hands with them, one inquired after their health, in\r\nthe second person singular--'Comment vas tu, mon vieux cochon?' or,\r\nbetter still, 'Comment vas tu, mon vieux citoyen?'\" \"It would do\r\nadmirably,\" says papa; \"but it does not matter whether you say cochon or\r\ncitoyen, the terms are synonymous.\"\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that beneath this rather clever banter there was\r\na certain measure of truth. Louis-Philippe was by no means the ardent\r\nadmirer of the bourgeoisie he professed to be. He did not foster any\r\nillusions with regard to their intellectual worth, and in his inmost\r\nheart he resented their so-called admiration of him, which he knew to be\r\nwould-be patronage under another name. They had formed a hedge round him\r\nwhich prevented any attempt on his part at conciliating his own caste,\r\nthe old noblesse. It is doubtful whether he would have been successful,\r\nespecially in the earlier years of his reign; but their ostracism of him\r\nand his family rankled in his mind, and found vent now and again in an\r\nepigram that stung the author as much as the party against which it was\r\ndirected. \"There is more difficulty in getting people to my court\r\nentertainments from across the Seine than from across the Channel,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that the whole of the Faubourg St.-Germain was conspicuous\r\nby its absence from the Tuileries in those days, and that the English\r\nwere in rather too great a majority. They were not always a\r\ndistinguished company. I was little more than a lad at this time, but I\r\nremember Lord ----'s invariable answer when his friends asked him what\r\nthe dinner had been like, and whether he had enjoyed himself: \"The\r\ndinner was like that at a good table-d'hôte, and I enjoyed myself as I\r\nwould enjoy myself at a good hotel in Switzerland or at Wiesbaden, where\r\nthe proprietor knew me personally, and had given orders to the head\r\nwaiter to look after my comforts. But,\" he added, \"it is, after all,\r\nmore pleasant dining there, when the English are present. At any rate,\r\nthere is no want of respect. When the French sit round the table, it is\r\nnot like a king dining with his subjects, but like half a hundred kings\r\ndining with one subject.\" Allowing for a certain amount of exaggeration,\r\nthere was a good deal of truth in the remarks, as I found out\r\nafterwards. \"The bourgeoisie in their attitude towards me,\" said\r\nLouis-Philippe, one day, to the English nobleman I have just quoted,\r\n\"are always reminding me of Adalbéron of Rheims with Hugues Capet: 'Qui\r\nt'as fait roi?' asked the bishop. 'Qui t'as fait duc?' retorted the\r\nking. I have made them dukes to a greater extent, though, than they have\r\nmade me king.\"\r\n\r\nFor Louis-Philippe was a witty king--wittier, perhaps, than any that had\r\nsat on the throne of France since Henri IV. Some of his mots have become\r\nhistorical, and even his most persistent detractors have been unable to\r\nconvict him of plagiarism with regard to them. What he specially\r\nexcelled in was the \"mot de la fin\" anglicé--the clenching of an\r\nargument, such as, for instance, his final remark on the death of\r\nTalleyrand. He had paid him a visit the day before. When the news of the\r\nprince's death was brought to him, he said, \"Are you sure he is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very sure, sire,\" was the answer. \"Why, did not your majesty himself\r\nnotice yesterday that he was dying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, but there is no judging from appearances with Talleyrand, and I\r\nhave been asking myself for the last four and twenty hours what interest\r\nhe could possibly have in departing at this particular moment.\"\r\n\r\nTo those who knew Louis-Philippe personally, it was very patent that he\r\ndisliked those who had been instrumental in setting him on the throne,\r\nand who, under the cloak of \"liberty, fraternity, and equality,\" were\r\nseeking their own interest only, namely, the bourgeoisie. He knew their\r\nquasi-goodwill to him to be so much sheer hypocrisy, and perhaps he and\r\nthey were too much alike in some respects, in their love of money for\r\nthe sake of hoarding it. It was, perhaps, the only serious failing that\r\ncould be laid to the charge of the family, because none of its members,\r\nwith the exception of the Duc d'Orléans, were entirely free from it. It\r\nmust not be inferred, though, that Louis-Philippe kept his purse closed\r\nto really deserving cases of distress. Far from it. I have the following\r\nstory from my old tutor, to whom I am, moreover, indebted for a great\r\nmany notes, dealing with events of which I could not possibly have had\r\nany knowledge but for him.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 the greater part of the Galerie d'Orléans in the Palais-Royal\r\nwas completed. The unsightly wooden booths had been taken down, and the\r\ntimber must have been decidedly worth a small fortune. Several\r\ncontractors made very handsome offers for it, but Louis-Philippe (then\r\nDuc d'Orléans) refused to sell it. It was to be distributed among the\r\npoor of the neighbourhood for fuel for the ensuing winter, which\r\nthreatened to be a severe one. One day, when the duke was inspecting the\r\nworks in company of his steward, an individual, who was standing a\r\ncouple of yards away, began to shout at the top of his voice, \"Vive\r\nLouis-Philippe!\" \"Go and see what the fellow wants, for assuredly he\r\nwants something,\" said the duke, who was a Voltairean in his way, and\r\nhad interpreted the man's enthusiasm aright. Papa Sournois was one of\r\nthose nondescripts for whom even now there appear to be more resources\r\nin the French capital than elsewhere. At the period in question he\r\nmainly got his living by selling contre-marques (checks) at the doors of\r\nthe theatre. He had heard of the duke's intention with regard to the\r\nwood, hence his enthusiastic cry of \"Vive Louis-Philippe!\" A cartload of\r\nwood was sent to his place; papa Sournois converted it into money, and\r\ngot drunk with the proceeds for a fortnight. When the steward, horribly\r\nscandalized, told the duke of the results of his benevolence, the latter\r\nmerely laughed, and sent for the wife, who made her appearance\r\naccompanied by a young brood of five. The duke gave her a five-franc\r\npiece, and told her to apply to the concierge of the Palais-Royal for a\r\nsimilar sum every day during the winter months. Of course, five francs a\r\nday was not as much as a drop of water out of the sea when we consider\r\nLouis-Philippe's stupendous income, and yet when the Tuileries were\r\nsacked in 1848, documents upon documents were found, compiled with the\r\nsole view of saving a few francs per diem out of the young princes'\r\n\"keep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so sick of the word 'fraternity,'\" said Prince Metternich, after\r\nhis return from France, \"that, if I had a brother, I should call him\r\ncousin.\" Though it was to the strains of the Marseillaise that\r\nLouis-Philippe had been conducted to the Hôtel-de-Ville on the day when\r\nLafayette pointed to him as \"the best of all republics,\" a time came\r\nwhen Louis-Philippe got utterly sick of the Marseillaise.\r\n\r\nBut what was he to do, seeing that his attempt at introducing a new\r\nnational hymn had utterly failed? The mob refused to sing \"La\r\nParisienne,\" composed by Casimir de la Vigne, after Alexandre Dumas had\r\nrefused to write a national hymn; and they, moreover, insisted on the\r\nKing joining in the chorus of the old hymn, as he had hitherto done on\r\nall public occasions.[35] They had grumblingly resigned themselves to\r\nhis beating time no longer, but any further refusal of his co-operation\r\nmight have been resented in a less peaceful fashion. On the other hand,\r\nthere was the bourgeoisie who were of opinion that, now that the\r\nmonarchy had entered upon a more conservative period, the intoning of\r\nthe hymn, at any rate on the sovereign's part, was out of place, and\r\nsavoured too much of a republican manifestation. \"It was Guizot who told\r\nhim so,\" said Lord ----, who had been standing on the balcony of the\r\nTuileries on the occasion of the king's \"saint's day,\"[36] and had heard\r\nthe minister make the remark.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 35: When there was no public occasion, his political\r\n         antagonists or merely practical jokers who knew of his dislike\r\n         invented one, like Edouard d'Ourliac, a well-known journalist\r\n         and the author of several novels, who, whenever he had nothing\r\n         better to do, recruited a band of street arabs to go and sing\r\n         the Marseillaise under the king's windows. They kept on singing\r\n         until Louis-Philippe, in sheer self-defence, was obliged to\r\n         come out and join in the song.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 36: In France it is the Patron Saint's day, not the\r\n         birthday, that is kept.]\r\n\r\n\"And what did the king reply?\" was the question.\r\n\r\n\"Do not worry yourself, monsieur le ministre; I am only moving my lips;\r\nI have ceased to pronounce the words for many a day.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the expedients to which Louis-Philippe was reduced before he\r\nhad been on the throne half a dozen years. \"I am like the fool between\r\ntwo stools,\" observed the king in English, afterwards, when speaking to\r\nLord ----, \"only I happen to be between the comfortably stuffed\r\neasy-chair of the bourgeois drawing-room and the piece of furniture\r\nseated on which Louis XIV. is said to have received the Dutch\r\nambassadors.\"\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of the Marseillaise, here are two stories in connection\r\nwith it which are not known to the general reader. The first was told to\r\nme by the old tutor already mentioned; the second aroused a great deal\r\nof literary curiosity in the year 1860, and bears the stamp of truth on\r\nthe face of it. It was, however, never fully investigated, or, at any\r\nrate, the results of the investigation were never published.[37]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 37: I have inserted them here in order not to fall\r\n         into repetitions on the same subject.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"We were all more or less aware,\" said my informant, \"that Rouget de\r\nl'Isle was not the author of the whole of the words of the Marseillaise.\r\nBut none of us in Lyons, where I was born, knew who had written the last\r\nstrophe, commonly called the 'strophe of the children,' and I doubt\r\nwhether they were any wiser in Paris. Some of my fellow-students--for I\r\nwas nearly eighteen at that time--credited André Chenier with the\r\nauthorship of the last strophe, others ascribed it to Louis-François\r\nDubois, the poet.[38] All this was, however, so much guess-work, when,\r\none day during the Reign of Terror, the report spread that a ci-devant\r\npriest, or rather a priest who had refused to take the oath to the\r\nRepublic, had been caught solemnizing a religious marriage, and that he\r\nwas to be brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal that same afternoon.\r\nThough you may not think so, merely going by what you have read, the\r\nappearance of a priest before the Tribunal always aroused more than\r\ncommon interest, nor have you any idea what more than common interest\r\nmeant in those days. A priest to the Revolutionaries and to the\r\nTerrorists, they might hector and bully as they liked, was not an\r\nordinary being. They looked upon him either as something better than a\r\nman or worse than a devil. They had thrown the religious compass they\r\nhad brought from home with them overboard, and they had not the\r\nphilosophical one to take its place. You may work out the thing for\r\nyourself; at any rate, the place was crammed to suffocation when we\r\narrived at the Hôtel de Ville. It was a large room, at the upper end of\r\nwhich stood an oblong table, covered with a black cloth. Seated around\r\nit were seven self-constituted judges. Besides their tricolour scarfs\r\nround their waists, they wore, suspended by a ribbon from their necks, a\r\nsmall silver axe.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 38: Louis-François Dubois, the author of several\r\n         heroic poems, \"Ankarström,\" \"Geneviève et Siegfried,\" etc.,\r\n         which are utterly forgotten. His main title to the recollection\r\n         of posterity consists in his having saved, during the\r\n         Revolution, a great many literary works of value, which he\r\n         returned to the State afterwards.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"As a rule there was very little speechifying. 'La mort sans phrase,'\r\nwhich had become the fashion since Louis XVI.'s execution, was strictly\r\nadhered to. Half a dozen prisoners were brought in and taken away\r\nwithout arousing the slightest excitement, either in the way of\r\ncommiseration or hatred. After having listened, the judges either\r\nextended their hands on the table or put them to their foreheads. The\r\nfirst movement meant acquittal and liberation, the second death; not\r\nalways by the guillotine though, for the instrument was not perfect as\r\nyet, and did not work sufficiently quickly to please them. All at once\r\nthe priest was brought in, and a dead silence prevailed. He was not a\r\nvery old man, though his hair was snow-white.\r\n\r\n\"'Who art thou?' asked the president.\r\n\r\n\"The prisoner drew himself up to his full height. 'I am the Abbé\r\nPessoneaux, a former tutor at the college at Vienne, and the author of\r\nthe last strophe of the Marseillaise,' he said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot convey to you the impression produced by those simple words.\r\nThe silence became positively oppressive; you could hear the people\r\nbreathe. The president did not say another word; the priest's reply had\r\napparently stunned him also: he merely turned round to his\r\nfellow-judges. Soldiers and gaolers stood as if turned into stone; every\r\neye was directed towards the table, watching for the movement of the\r\njudges' hands. Slowly and deliberately they stretched them forth, and\r\nthen a deafening cheer rang through the room. The Abbé Pessoneaux owed\r\nhis life to his strophe, for, though his story was not questioned then,\r\nit was proved true in every particular. On their way to Paris to be\r\npresent at the taking of the Tuileries on the 10th of August, the\r\nMarseillais had stopped at Vienne to celebrate the Fête of the\r\nFederation. On the eve of their arrival the Abbé Pessoneaux had composed\r\nthe strophe, and but for his seizure the authorship would have always\r\nremained a matter of conjecture, for Rouget de l'Isle would have never\r\nhad the honesty to acknowledge it.\"\r\n\r\nMy tutor was right, and I owe him this tardy apology; it appears that,\r\nafter all, Rouget de l'Isle had not the honesty to acknowledge _openly_\r\nhis indebtedness to those who made his name immortal, and that his share\r\nin the Marseillaise amounts to the first six strophes. He did not write\r\na single note of the music. The latter was composed by Alexandre\r\nBoucher, the celebrated violinist, in 1790, in the drawing-room of\r\nMadame de Mortaigne, at the request of a colonel whom the musician had\r\nnever met before, whom he never saw again. The soldier was starting next\r\nmorning with his regiment for Marseilles, and pressed Boucher to write\r\nhim a march there and then. Rouget de l'Isle, an officer of engineers,\r\nhaving been imprisoned in 1791, for having refused to take a second oath\r\nto the Constitution, heard the march from his cell, and, at the instance\r\nof his gaoler, adapted the words of a patriotic hymn he was then writing\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nOne may fancy the surprise of Alexandre Boucher, when he heard it sung\r\neverywhere and recognized it as his own composition, though it had been\r\nsomewhat altered to suit the words. But the pith of the story is to\r\ncome. I give it in the very words of Boucher himself, as he told it to a\r\nParis journalist whom I knew well.\r\n\r\n\"A good many years afterwards, I was seated next to Rouget de l'Isle at\r\na dinner-party in Paris. We had never met before, and, as you may\r\neasily imagine, I was rather interested in the gentleman, whom, with\r\nmany others at the same board, I complimented on his production; only I\r\nconfined myself to complimenting him on his _poem_.\r\n\r\n\"'You don't say a word about the music,' he replied; 'and yet, being a\r\ncelebrated musician, that ought to interest you. Do not you like it?'\r\n\r\n\"'Very much indeed,' I said, in a somewhat significant tone.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, let me be frank with you. The music is not mine. It was that of\r\na march which came, Heaven knows whence, and which they kept on playing\r\nat Marseilles during the Terror, when I was a prisoner at the fortress\r\nof St. Jean. I made a few alterations necessitated by the words, and\r\nthere it is.'\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon, to his great surprise, I hummed the march as I had\r\noriginally written it.\r\n\r\n\"'Wonderful!' he exclaimed; 'how did you come by it?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"When I told him, he threw himself round my neck. But the next moment he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"'I am very sorry, my dear Boucher, but I am afraid that you will be\r\ndespoiled for ever, do what you will; for your music and my words go so\r\nwell together, that they seem to have sprung simultaneously from the\r\nsame brain, and the world, even if I proclaimed my indebtedness to you,\r\nwould never believe it.'\r\n\r\n\"'Keep the loan,' I said, moved, in spite of myself, by his candour.\r\n'Without your genius, my march would be forgotten by now. You have given\r\nit a patent of nobility. It is yours for ever.'\"\r\n\r\nI return to Louis-Philippe, who, at the time of my tutor's story, and\r\nfor some years afterwards, I only knew from the reports that were\r\nbrought home to us. Of course, I saw him several times at a distance, at\r\nreviews, and on popular holidays, and I was surprised that a king of\r\nwhom every one spoke so well in private, who seemed to have so much\r\ncause for joy and happiness in his own family, should look so careworn\r\nand depressed in public. For, young as I was, I did not fail to see\r\nthat, beneath the calm and smiling exterior, there was a great deal of\r\nhidden grief. But I was too young to understand the deep irony of his\r\nreply to one of my relatives, a few months before his accession to the\r\nthrone: \"The crown of France is too cold in winter, too warm in summer;\r\nthe sceptre is too blunt as a weapon of defence or attack, it is too\r\nshort as a stick to lean upon: a good felt hat and a strong umbrella are\r\nat all times more useful.\" Above all, I was too young to understand the\r\ntemper of the French where their rulers were concerned, and though, at\r\nthe time of my writing these notes, I have lived for fifty years amongst\r\nthem, I doubt whether I could give a succinct psychological account of\r\ntheir mental attitude towards their succeeding régimes, except by\r\nborrowing the words of one of their cleverest countrywomen, Madame Émile\r\nde Girardin: \"When Marshal Soult is in the Opposition, he is\r\nacknowledged to have won the battle of Toulouse; when he belongs to the\r\nGovernment, he is accused of having lost it.\" Since then the Americans\r\nhave coined a word for that state of mind--\"cussedness.\"\r\n\r\nLouis-Philippe's children, and especially his sons, some of whom I knew\r\npersonally before I had my first invitation to the Tuileries, seemed to\r\ntake matters more cheerfully. Save the partisans of the elder branch, no\r\none had a word to say against them. On the contrary, even the\r\nBonapartists admired their manly and straightforward bearing. I remember\r\nbeing at Tortoni's one afternoon when the Duc d'Orléans and his brother,\r\nthe Duc de Nemours, rode by. Two of my neighbours, unmistakable\r\nImperialists, and old soldiers by their looks, stared very hard at them;\r\nthen one said, \"Si le petit au lieu de filer le parfait amour partout,\r\navait mis tous ses oeufs dans le même panier, il aurait eu des grands\r\ncomme cela et nous ne serions pas dans l'impasse où nous sommes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mon cher,\" replied the other, \"des grands comme cela ne se font qu'à\r\nloisir, pas entre deux campagnes.\"[39]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 39: It reminds one of the answer of the younger Dumas\r\n         to a gentleman whose wife had been notorious for her conjugal\r\n         faithlessness, and whose sons were all weaklings. \"Ah, Monsieur\r\n         Dumas, c'est un fils comme vous qu'il me fallait,\" he\r\n         exclaimed. \"Mon cher monsieur,\" came the reply, \"quand on veut\r\n         avoir un fils comme moi, il faut le faire soi-même.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe admiration of these two veterans was perfectly justified: they were\r\nvery handsome young men, the sons of Louis-Philippe, and notably the two\r\nelder ones, though the Duc d'Orléans was somewhat more delicate-looking\r\nthan his brother, De Nemours. The boys had all been brought up very\r\nsensibly, perhaps somewhat too strict for their position. They all went\r\nto a public school, to the Collége Henri IV., and I remember well,\r\nabout the year '38, when I had occasion of a morning to cross the\r\nPont-Neuf, where there were still stalls and all sorts of booths, seeing\r\nthe blue-and-yellow carriage with the royal livery. It contained the\r\nDucs d'Aumale and de Montpensier, who had not finished their studies at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nBut though strictly brought up, they were by no means milksops, and\r\nwhat, for want of a better term, I may call \"mother's babies:\" quite the\r\nreverse. It was never known how they managed it, but at night, when they\r\nwere supposed to be at home, if not in bed, they were to be met with at\r\nall kinds of public places, notably at the smaller theatres, such as the\r\nVaudeville, the Variétés, and the Palais-Royal, one of which, at any\r\nrate, was a goodly distance from the Tuileries. It was always understood\r\nthat the King knew nothing about these little escapades, but I am\r\ninclined to doubt this: I fancy he connived at them; because, when Lord\r\n---- told him casually one day that he had met his sons the night\r\nbefore, Louis-Philippe seemed not in the least surprised, he only\r\nanxiously asked, \"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the Café de Paris, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe king seemed relieved. \"That's all right,\" he said, laughing. \"As\r\nlong as they do not go into places where they are likely to meet with\r\nGuizot, I don't mind; for if he saw them out in the evening, it might\r\ncost me my throne. Guizot is so terribly respectable. I am afraid there\r\nis a mistake either about his nationality or about his respectability;\r\nthey are badly matched.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that though Louis-Philippe admired and respected Guizot, he\r\nfailed to understand him. To the most respectable of modern kings--not\r\neven Charles I. and William III. excepted--if by respectability we mean\r\nan unblemished private life--Guizot's respectability was an enigma. The\r\nman who, in spite of his advice to others, \"Enrichissez vous,\r\nenrichissez vous,\" was as poor at the end of his ministerial career as\r\nat the beginning, must have necessarily been a puzzle to a sovereign\r\nwho, with a civil list of £750,000, was haunted by the fear of poverty,\r\nand haunted to such a degree as to harass his friends and counsellors\r\nwith his apprehensions. \"My dear minister,\" he said one day to Guizot,\r\nafter he had recited a long list of his domestic charges--\"My dear\r\nminister, I am telling you that my children will be wanting for bread.\"\r\nThe recollection of his former misery uprose too frequently before him\r\nlike a horrible nightmare, and made him the first bourgeois instead of\r\nthe first gentilhomme of the kingdom, as his predecessors had been. When\r\na tradesman drops a shilling and does not stoop to pick it up, his\r\nneglect becomes almost culpable improvidence; when a prince drops a\r\nsovereign and looks for it, the deed may be justly qualified as mean.\r\nThe _leitmotif_ of Louis-Philippe's conversation, witty and charming as\r\nit was, partook of the avaricious spirit of a Thomas Guy and a John\r\nOvers rather than of that of the great adventurer John Law. The chinking\r\nof the money-bags is audible through both, but in the one case the\r\norchestration is strident, disagreeable, depressing; in the other, it is\r\ngenerous, overflowing with noble impulses, and cheering. I recollect\r\nthat during my stay at Tréport and Eu, in 1843, when Queen Victoria paid\r\nher visit to Louis-Philippe, the following story was told to me. Lord\r\n---- and I were quartered in a little hostelry on the Place du Château.\r\nOne morning Lord ---- came home laughing till he could laugh no longer.\r\n\"What do you think the King has done now?\" he asked. I professed my\r\ninability to guess. \"About an hour ago, he and Queen Victoria were\r\nwalking in the garden, when, with true French politeness, he offered her\r\na peach. The Queen seemed rather embarrassed how to skin it, when\r\nLouis-Philippe took a large clasp-knife from his pocket. 'When a man has\r\nbeen a poor devil like myself, obliged to live upon forty sous a day, he\r\nalways carries a knife. I might have dispensed with it for the last few\r\nyears; still, I do not wish to lose the habit--one does not know what\r\nmay happen,' he said. Of course, the tears stood in the Queen's eyes. He\r\nreally ought to know better than to obtrude his money worries upon every\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nI must confess that I was not as much surprised as my interlocutor, who,\r\nhowever, had known Louis-Philippe much longer than I. Not his worst\r\nenemies could have accused the son of Philippe Égalité of being a\r\ncoward: the bulletins of Valmy, Jemmappes, and Neerwinden would have\r\nproved the contrary. But the contempt of physical danger on the\r\nbattle-field does not necessarily constitute heroism in the most\r\nelevated sense of the term, although the world in general frequently\r\naccepts it as such. A man can die but once, and the semi-positivism,\r\nsemi-Voltaireanism of Louis-Philippe had undoubtedly steeled him against\r\nthe fear of death. His religion, throughout life, was not even\r\nskin-deep; and when he accepted the last rites of the Church on his\r\ndeath-bed, he only did so in deference to his wife. \"Ma femme, es-tu\r\ncontente de moi?\" were his words the moment the priests were gone.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he was too good a husband to grieve his wife, who was\r\ndeeply religious, by any needless display of unbelief. He always\r\nendeavoured, as far as possible, to find an excuse for staying away from\r\nchurch. He, as well as the female members of his family, were very fond\r\nof music; and Adam, the composer, was frequently invited to come and\r\nplay for them in the private apartments. In fact, after his abdication,\r\nhe seriously intended to write, in conjunction with Scribe, the libretto\r\nof an opera on an English historical subject, the music of which should\r\nbe composed by Halévy. The composer of \"La Juive\" and the author of \"Les\r\nHugenots\" came over once to consult with the King, whose death, a few\r\nmonths later, put an end to the scheme.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of Adam's visits the princesses worked at their\r\nembroidery, while the King often stood by the side of the performer.\r\nJust about that period the chamber organ was introduced, and, on the\r\nrecommendation of Adam, one was ordered for the Tuileries. The first\r\ntime Louis-Philippe heard it played he was delighted: \"This will be a\r\ndistinct gain to our rural congregations,\" he said. \"There must be a\r\ngreat many people who, like myself, stay away from church on account of\r\ntheir objection to that horrible instrument, the serpent. Is it not so,\r\nmy wife?\"\r\n\r\nThe ideal purpose of life, if ever he possessed it, had been crushed out\r\nof him--first, by his governess, Madame de Genlis; secondly, by the dire\r\npoverty he suffered during his exile: and, notwithstanding all that has\r\nbeen said to the contrary, France wanted at that moment an ideal ruler,\r\nnot the rational father of a large family who looked upon his monarchy\r\nas a suitable means of providing for them. He was an usurper without the\r\ndaring, the grandeur, the lawlessness of the usurper. The lesson of\r\nNapoléon I.'s method had been thrown away upon him, as the lesson of\r\nNapoléon III.'s has been thrown away upon his grandson. When I said\r\nFrance, I made a mistake,--I should have said Paris; for since 1789\r\nthere was no longer a King of France, there was only a King of Paris.\r\nSuch a thing as a Manchester movement, as a Manchester school of\r\npolitics, would have been and is still an impossibility in France.\r\n\r\nAnd, unfortunately, Paris, which had applauded the glorious\r\n_mise-en-scène_ of the First Empire, which had even looked on\r\napprovingly at some of the pomp and state of Louis XVIII. and Charles\r\nX., jeered at Louis-Philippe and his court with its ridiculous\r\ngatherings of tailors, drapers, and bootmakers, \"ces gardes nationaux\r\nd'un pays où il n'y a plus rien de national à garder,\" and their\r\npretentious spouses \"qui,\" according to the Duchesse de la Trémoïlle,\r\n\"ont plus de chemises que nos aïeules avaient des robes.\"[40] She and\r\nthe Princesse Bagration were the only female representatives of the\r\nFaubourg St. Germain who attended these gatherings; for the Countess Le\r\nHon, of whom I may have occasion to speak again, and who was the only\r\nother woman at these receptions that could lay claim to any distinction,\r\nwas by no means an aristocrat. And be it remembered that in those days\r\nridicule had still the power to kill.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 40: She had unconsciously borrowed the words from the\r\n         Duchesse de Coislin, who, under similar circumstances a few\r\n         years before, said to Madame de Chateaubriand, \"Cela sent la\r\n         parvenue; nous autres, femmes de la cour, nous n'avions que\r\n         deux chemises; on les renouvelait quand elles étaient usées;\r\n         nous étions vêtues de robes de soie et nous n'avions pas l'air\r\n         de grisettes comme ces demoiselles de maintenant.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nNor was the weapon wielded exclusively by the aristocracy; the lower\r\nclasses could be just as satirical against the new court element. I was\r\nin the Tuileries gardens on that first Sunday in June, 1837, when the\r\nDuchesse d'Orléans made her entrée into Paris. The weather was\r\nmagnificent, and the set scene--as distinguished from some of the\r\nproperties, to use a theatrical expression--in keeping with the weather.\r\nThe crowd itself was a pleasure to look at, as it stood in serried\r\nmasses behind the National Guards and the regular infantry lining the\r\nroute of the procession from the Arc de Triomphe to the entrance of the\r\nChâteau. All at once an outrider passes, covered with dust, and the\r\ncrowd presses forward to get a better view. A woman of the people, in\r\nher nice white cap, comes into somewhat violent contact with an\r\nelegantly dressed elderly lady, accompanied by her daughter. The woman,\r\ninstead of apologizing, says aloud that she wishes to see the princess:\r\n\"You will have the opportunity of seeing her at court, mesdames,\" she\r\nadds. The elegant lady vouchsafes no reply, but turns to her daughter:\r\n\"The good woman,\" says the latter, shrugging her shoulders, \"is\r\nevidently not aware that she has got a much greater chance of going to\r\nthat court than we have. She has only got to marry some grocer or other\r\ntradesman, and she will be considered a grande dame at once.\" Then the\r\nprocession passes--first the National Guards on horseback, then the King\r\nand M. de Montalivet, followed by Princesse Hélène, with her young\r\nhusband riding by the side of the carriage. So far so good: the first\r\nthree or four carriages were more or less handsome, but Heaven save us\r\nfrom the rest, as well as from their occupants! They positively looked\r\nlike some of those wardrobe-dealers so admirably described by Balzac.\r\n\r\nWhen all is over, the woman of the people turns to the elegant lady: \"I\r\nask your pardon, madame; it was really not worth while hurting you. If\r\nthese are _grandes dames_, I prefer _les petites_ whom I see in my\r\nneighbourhood, the Rue Notre-Dame de Lorette. Comme elles étaient\r\nattifées!\"--_Anglice_, \"What a lot of frumps they looked!\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, Louis-Philippe and his queen sinned most grievously by\r\noverlooking the craving of the Parisians for pomp and display. No one\r\nwas better aware of this than his children, notably the Duc d'Orléans,\r\nPrincess Clémentine,[41] and the Duc de Nemours. They called him\r\nfamiliarly \"le père.\" \"Il est trop père,\" said the princess in private;\r\n\"il fait concurrence au Père Éternel.\" She was a very clever\r\ngirl--perhaps a great deal cleverer than any of her brothers, the Solon\r\nof the family, the Duc de Nemours, included--but very fond of mischief\r\nand practical joking. She found her match, though, in her brother, the\r\nPrince de Joinville, the son of Louis-Philippe of whom France heard most\r\nand saw least, for he was a sailor. One day, his sister asked him to\r\nbring her a complete dress of a Red-Skin chieftain's wife. His absence\r\nwas shorter than usual, and, a few days before his return, he told her\r\nin a letter that he had the costume she wanted. \"Here, Clémentine, this\r\nis for you,\" he said, at his arrival, putting a string of glass beads on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 41: The mother of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg,\r\n         the present ruler of Bulgaria. She was a particular favourite\r\n         of Queen Victoria, and Louis-Philippe himself not only\r\n         considered her the cleverest of his three daughters, but the\r\n         most likely successor to his sister Adelaide, as his private\r\n         adviser. That the estimate of her abilities was by no means\r\n         exaggerated, subsequent events have proved. The last time I saw\r\n         the princess was at the garden party at Sheen-House, on the\r\n         occasion of the silver wedding of the Count and Countess de\r\n         Paris. I did not remember her for the moment, for a score of\r\n         years had made a difference. I asked an Austrian attaché who\r\n         she was. The answer came pat, \"Alexander III.'s nightmare,\r\n         Francis-Joseph's bogy, and Bismarck's sleeping draught; one of\r\n         the three clever women in Europe; Bulgaria's mother.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"Very pretty,\" said Clémentine, \"but you promised me a complete dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the complete dress. I never saw them wear any other.\"\r\n\r\nI did not see the Prince de Joinville very often, perhaps two or three\r\ntimes in all; once on the occasion of his marriage with Princess\r\nFrançoise de Bourbon, the daughter of Dom Pedro I. of Brazil, and sister\r\nof the present emperor, when the prince brought his young bride to\r\nParis. He was a clever draughtsman and capital caricaturist; but if the\r\nfirst of these talents proved an unfailing source of delight to his\r\nparents, the second frequently inspired them with terror, especially his\r\nfather, who never knew which of his ministers might become the next butt\r\nfor his third son's pencil. I have seen innumerable sketches, ostensibly\r\ndone to delight his young wife and brothers, which, had they been\r\npublished, would have been much more telling against his father's\r\npictorial satirists than anything they produced against the sovereign.\r\nFor in those days, whatever wisdom or caution they may have learnt\r\nafterwards, the sons of Louis-Philippe were by no means disposed to sit\r\ndown tamely under the insults levelled at the head of their house. In\r\nfact, nearly the whole of Louis-Philippe's children had graphic talents\r\nof no mean order. The trait came to them from their mother, who was a\r\nvery successful pupil of Angelica Kauffman. Princesse Marie, who died so\r\nyoung, executed a statue of Jeanne d'Arc, which was considered by\r\ncompetent judges, not at all likely to be influenced by the fact of the\r\nartist's birth, a very creditable piece of work indeed. I never saw it,\r\nso I cannot say, but I have seen some miniatures by the Duc de Nemours,\r\nwhich might fairly rank with performances by the best masters of that\r\nart, short of genius.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious, but nevertheless admitted fact that the world has never\r\ndone justice to the second son of Louis-Philippe. He was not half as\r\ngreat a favourite with the Parisians as his elder brother, although in\r\nvirtue of his remarkable likeness to Henri IV., whom the Parisians still\r\nworship--probably because he is dead,--he ought to have commanded their\r\nsympathies. This lukewarmness towards the Duc de Nemours has generally\r\nbeen ascribed by the partisans of the Orleanist dynasty to his somewhat\r\nreticent disposition, which by many people was mistaken for _hauteur_.\r\nI rather fancy it was because he was suspected of being his father's\r\nadviser, and, what was worse, his father's adviser in a reactionary\r\nsense. He was accused of being an anti-parliamentarian, and he never\r\ntook the trouble to refute the charge, probably because he was too\r\nhonest to tell a lie.[42] I met the Duc de Nemours for the first time in\r\nthe studio of a painter, Eugène Lami, just as I met his elder brother in\r\nthat of Decamps. In fact, all these young princes were sincere admirers\r\nand patrons of art, and, if they had had their will, the soirées at the\r\nTuileries would have been graced by the presence of artists more\r\nfrequently than they were; but, preposterous and scarcely credible as it\r\nmay seem, the bourgeoisie looked upon this familiar intercourse of the\r\nking's sons with artists, literary men, and the like, as so much\r\ncondescension, if not worse, of which they, the bourgeoisie, would not\r\nbe guilty if they could help it. It behoves me, however, to be careful\r\nin this instance, for the English aristocracy at home was not much more\r\nliberal in those days.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 42: There was a similar divergence of dynastic\r\n         opinion during the Second Empire between the sovereign and\r\n         those placed very near him on the throne. When Alphonse Daudet\r\n         came to Paris to make a name in literature, the Duc de Morny\r\n         offered him a position as secretary. \"Before I accept it,\r\n         monsieur le duc, I had better tell you that I am a Legitimist,\"\r\n         replied the future novelist. \"Don't let that trouble you,\"\r\n         laughed De Morny; \"so am I to a certain extent, and the Empress\r\n         is even more of a Legitimist than I am.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe first thing that struck one in the Duc de Nemours was the vast\r\nextent of his general information and the marvellous power of memory.\r\nEugène Lami had just returned from London, and, in the exercise of his\r\nprofession, had come in contact with some members of the oldest\r\nfamilies. The mere mention of the name sufficed as the introduction to\r\nthe general and anecdotal history of such a family, and I doubt whether\r\nthe best official at Herald's College could have dissected a pedigree as\r\ndid the Duc de Nemours. Eugène Lami was at that time engaged upon\r\ndesigning some new uniforms for the army, many of which disappeared only\r\nafter the war of 1870. He lived in the Rue des Marais, the greater part\r\nof which was subsequently demolished to make room for the Boulevard de\r\nMagenta, and in the same house with two men whose names have become\r\nimmortal, Honoré de Balzac and Paul Delaroche. I have already spoken of\r\nboth, but I did not mention the incident that led to the painter's\r\nacquaintance with the novelist, an incident so utterly fanciful that the\r\nboldest farce-writer would think twice before utilizing it in a play. It\r\nwas told to me by Lami himself. One morning, as he and Paul Delaroche\r\nwere working, there was a knock at the door, and a stout individual,\r\ndressed in a kind of monastic garb, appeared on the threshold. Delaroche\r\nremembered that he had met him on the staircase, but neither knew who he\r\nwas, albeit that Balzac's fame was not altogether unknown to them.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the visitor, \"I am Honoré Balzac, a neighbour and a\r\nconfrère to boot. My chattels are about to be seized, and I would ask\r\nyou to save a remnant of my library.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the request was granted. The books were stowed away behind\r\nthe pictures; and, after that, Balzac often dropped in to have a chat\r\nwith them, but neither Delaroche nor Lami, the latter least of all, ever\r\nconceived a sincere liking for the great novelist. Their characters were\r\naltogether dissimilar. I have seen a good many men whose names have\r\nbecome household words among the refined, the educated, and the\r\nart-loving all the world over; I have seen them at the commencement, in\r\nthe middle, and at the zenith of their career: I have seen none more\r\nindifferent to the material benefits of their art than Eugène Lami and\r\nPaul Delaroche, not even Eugène Delacroix and Decamps. Balzac was the\r\nvery reverse. To make a fortune was the sole ambition of his life.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to Louis-Philippe's sons. I have said that the\r\nDuc de Nemours was essentially the grand seigneur of the family; truth\r\ncompels me to add, however, that there was a certain want of pliability\r\nabout him which his social inferiors could not have relished. It was\r\nHenri IV. minus the bonhomie, also perhaps minus that indiscriminate\r\ngalanterie which endeared Ravaillac's victim to all classes, even when\r\nhe was no longer young. In the days of which I am treating just now, the\r\nDuc de Nemours was very young. As for his courage, it was simply above\r\nsuspicion; albeit that it was called in question after the revolution of\r\n'48, to his father's intense sorrow. No after-dinner encomium was ever\r\nas absolutely true as that of Sir Robert Peel on the sons and daughters\r\nof the last King of France, when he described them as respectively brave\r\nand chaste. Nevertheless, had the Duc de Nemours and his brothers been a\r\nthousand times as brave as they were, party spirit, than which there is\r\nnothing more contemptible in France, would have found the opportunity of\r\ndenying that bravery.\r\n\r\nIf these notes are ever published, Englishmen will smile at what I am\r\nabout to write now, unless their disgust takes another form of\r\nexpression. The exploits of the Duc d'Aumale in Algeria are quoted by\r\nindependent military authorities as so many separate deeds of signal\r\nheroism. They belong to history, and not a single historian has\r\nendeavoured to impair their value. Will it be believed that the\r\nOpposition journals of those days spoke of them with ill-disguised\r\ncontempt as mere skirmishes with a lot of semi-savages? And, during the\r\nSecond Republic, many of these papers returned to the charge because the\r\nDuc d'Aumale, being the constitutionally-minded son of a\r\nconstitutionally-minded king, resigned the command of his army instead\r\nof bringing it to France to coerce a nation into retaining a ruler whom,\r\nostensibly at least, she had voluntarily accepted, and whom, therefore,\r\nshe was as free to reject.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these Algerian campaigns of the Duc d'Aumale, I had a\r\nstory told to me by his brother, De Montpensier, which becomes\r\nparticularly interesting nowadays, when spiritualism or spiritism is so\r\nmuch discussed. He had it from two unimpeachable sources, namely, from\r\nhis brother D'Aumale and from General Cousin-Montauban, afterwards Comte\r\nde Palikao, the same who was so terribly afraid, after the expedition in\r\nChina, that the emperor would create him Comte de Pékin, and who sent an\r\naide-de-camp in advance to beg the sovereign not to do so.[43]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 43: In order to understand this dread on Montauban's\r\n         part, the English reader should be told that the term _pékin_\r\n         is the contemptuous nickname for the civilian, with the French\r\n         soldier.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIt was to General Montauban that Abdel-Kader surrendered after the\r\nbattles of Isly and Djemma-Gazhouat. It was in the latter engagement\r\nthat a Captain de Géreaux fell, and when the news of his death reached\r\nhis family they seemed almost prepared for it. It transpired that, on\r\nthe very day of the engagement, and at the very hour in which Captain de\r\nGéreaux was struck down, his sister, a young and handsome but very\r\nimpressionable girl, started all of a sudden from her chair, exclaiming\r\nthat she had seen her brother, surrounded by Arabs, who were felling him\r\nto the ground. Then she dropped to the floor in a dead swoon.\r\n\r\nA few years elapsed, when General Montauban, who had become the\r\nmilitary Governor of the province of Oran, received a letter from the De\r\nGéreaux family, requesting him to make some further inquiries respecting\r\nthe particulars of the captain's death. The letter was written at the\r\nurgent prayer of Mdlle. de Géreaux, who had never ceased to think and\r\nspeak of her brother, and who, on one occasion, a month or so before the\r\ndespatch of the petition, had risen again from her chair, though in a\r\nmore composed manner than before, insisting that she had once more seen\r\nher brother. This time he was dressed in the native garb, he seemed very\r\npoor, and was delving the soil. These visions recurred at frequent\r\nintervals, to the intense distress of the family, who could not but\r\nascribe them to the overstrung imagination of Mdlle. de Géreaux. A\r\nlittle while after, she maintained having seen her brother in a white\r\nrobe and turban, and intoning hymns that sounded to her like Arabic. She\r\nimplored her parents to institute inquiries, and General Montauban was\r\ncommunicated with to that effect. He did all he could; the country was\r\nat peace, and, after a few months, tidings came that there was a\r\nFrenchman held prisoner in one of the villages on the Morocco frontier,\r\nwho for the last two or three years had entirely lost his reason, but\r\nthat, previous to that calamity, he had been converted to Islamism. His\r\nmental derangement being altogether harmless, he was an attendant at the\r\nMosque. As a matter of course, the information had been greatly\r\nembellished in having passed through so many channels, nor was it of so\r\ndefinite a character as I have noted it down, but that was the gist of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Montauban had been transferred to another command, and for a\r\ntwelvemonth after his successor's arrival the inquiry was allowed to\r\nfall in abeyance. When it was finally resumed, the French prisoner had\r\ndied, but, from a document written in his native language found upon him\r\nand brought to Oran, there remained little doubt that he was Captain de\r\nGéreaux.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to the Duc d'Aumale, who, curiously enough,\r\nexercised a greater influence on the outside world in general than any\r\nof his other brethren--an influence due probably to his enormous wealth\r\nrather than to his personal qualities, though the latter may, to some\r\npeople, have seemed remarkable. I met him but seldom during his father's\r\nlifetime. He was the beau-ideal of the preux chevalier, according to the\r\nFrench notion of the modern Bayard--that is, handsome, brave to a\r\nfault, irresistibly fascinating with women, good-natured in his way,\r\nand, above all, very witty. It was he who, after the confiscation of the\r\nd'Orléans' property by Napoléon III., replied to the French Ambassador\r\nat Turin, who inquired after his health, \"I am all right; health is one\r\nof the things that cannot be confiscated.\" Nevertheless, upon closer\r\nacquaintance, I failed to see the justifying cause for the preference\r\nmanifested by public opinion, and, upon more minute inquiry, I found\r\nthat a great many people shared my views. I am at this moment convinced\r\nthat, but for his having been the heir of that ill-fated Prince de\r\nCondé, and consequently the real defender in the various suits resulting\r\nfrom the assassination of that prince by Madame de Feuchères, he would\r\nhave been in no way distinguished socially from the rest of the\r\nD'Orléans.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of his eldest brother, the Duc d'Orléans, was, on the\r\ncontrary, due directly to the man himself. As far as one can judge of\r\nhim, he was the reverse of Charles II., in that he never said a wise\r\nthing and never did a foolish one. He was probably not half so clever as\r\nhis father, nor, brave as he may have been, would he have ever made so\r\ndashing a soldier as his brother D'Aumale, or so rollicking a sailor as\r\nhis brother De Joinville. He did not pretend to the wisdom of his\r\nbrother De Nemours, nor to the mystic tendencies of his youngest sister,\r\nnor to the sprightly wit of Princesse Clémentine, and yet withal he\r\nunderstood the French nation better than any of them. Even his\r\nprenuptial escapades, secrets to no one, were those of the grand\r\nseigneur, though by no means affichées; they endeared him to the\r\nmajority of the people. \"Chacun colon-ise à sa façon,\" was the lenient\r\nverdict on his admiration for Jenny Colon, at a moment when colonization\r\nin Algeria was the topic of the day. On the whole he liked artists\r\nbetter, perhaps, than art itself, yet it did not prevent him from buying\r\nmasterpieces as far as his means would allow him. Though still young, in\r\nthe latter end of the thirties, I was already a frequent visitor to the\r\nstudios of the great French painters, and it was in that of Decamps'\r\nthat I became alive to his character for the first time. I was talking\r\nto the great painter when the duke came in. We had met before, and shook\r\nhands, as he had been taught to do by his father when he met with an\r\nEnglishman. But I could not make out why he was carrying a pair of\r\ntrousers over his arm. After we had been chatting for about ten\r\nminutes, I wondering all the while what he was going to do with the\r\nnether garment, he caught one of my side glances, and burst out\r\nlaughing. \"I forgot,\" he said; \"here, Decamps, here are your breeches.\"\r\nThen he turned to me to explain. \"I always bring them up with me when I\r\ncome in the morning. The concierge is very old, and it saves her\r\ntrudging up four flights of stairs.\" The fact was, that the concierge,\r\nbefore she knew who he was, had once asked him to take up the painter's\r\nclothes and boots. From that day forth he never failed to ask for them\r\nwhen passing her lodge.\r\n\r\nI can but repeat, the Duc d'Orléans was one of the most charming men I\r\nhave known. I always couple him in my mind with Benjamin Disraeli, and\r\nAlexandre Dumas the elder. I knew the English statesman almost as well\r\nduring part of my life as the French novelist. Though intellectually\r\nwide apart from them, the duke had one, if not two traits in common with\r\nboth; his utter contempt for money affairs and the personal charm he\r\nwielded. I doubt whether this personal charm in the other two men was\r\ndue to their intellectual attainments; with the Duc d'Orléans it was\r\ncertainly not the case. He rarely, if ever, said anything worth\r\nremembering; in fact, he frankly acknowledged his very modest\r\nscholarship, and his inability either to remember the epigrams of others\r\nor to condense his thoughts into one of his own. \"I should not like to\r\nadmit as much to my father, who, it appears, is a very fine Greek and\r\nLatin scholar,\" he said--\"that is, if I am to believe my brothers, De\r\nNemours and D'Aumale, who ought to know; for, notwithstanding the prizes\r\nthey took at college, I believe they are very clever. Ah, you may well\r\nlook surprised at my saying, 'notwithstanding the prizes they took,'\r\nbecause I took ever so many, although, for the life of me, I could not\r\nconstrue a Greek sentence, and scarcely a Latin one. I have paid very\r\nhandsomely, however, for my ignorance.\" And then he told us an amusing\r\nstory of his having had to invent a secretaryship to the duchess for an\r\nold schoolfellow. \"You see, he came upon me unawares with a slip of\r\npaper I had written him while at college, asking him to explain to me a\r\nGreek passage. There was no denying it, I had signed it. What is worse\r\nstill, he is supposed to translate and to reply to the duchess's German\r\ncorrespondence, and, when I gave him the appointment, he did not know a\r\nsingle word of Schiller's language, so I had to pay a German tutor and\r\nhim too.\"\r\n\r\nI have said that the Duc d'Orléans was absolutely indifferent with\r\nregard to money, but he would not be fleeced with impunity. What he\r\ndisliked more than anything else, was the greed of the shopkeeping\r\nbourgeois. One day, while travelling in Lorraine, he stopped at the\r\nposting-house to have his breakfast, consisting of a couple of eggs, a\r\nfew slices of bread and butter, and a cup of coffee. Just before\r\nproceeding on his journey, his valet came to tell him that mine host\r\nwanted to charge him two hundred francs for the repast. The duke merely\r\nsent for the mayor, handed him a thousand-franc note, gave him the\r\nparticulars of his bill of fare, told him to pay the landlord according\r\nto the tariff, and to distribute the remainder of the money among the\r\npoor. It is more than probable that mine host was among the first, in\r\n'48, to hail the republic: princes and kings, according to him, were\r\nmade to be fleeced; if they objected, what was the good of having a\r\nmonarchy?\r\n\r\nThe popular idol in France must distribute largesse, and distribute it\r\nindividually, or be profitable in some other way. Greed, personal\r\ninterest, underlies most of the political strife in France. During one\r\nof the riots, so common in the reign of Louis-Philippe, Mimi-Lepreuil, a\r\nwell-known clever pick-pocket, was shouting with all his might, \"Vive\r\nLouis-Philippe! à bas la République!\" As a rule, gentlemen of his\r\nprofession are found on the plebeian side, and one of the\r\nsuperintendents of police on duty, who had closely watched him, inquired\r\ninto the reason of his apostasy. \"I am sick of your Republicans,\" was\r\nthe answer. \"I come here morning after morning\"--it happened on the\r\nPlace de la Bourse,--\"and dip my hands into a score of pockets without\r\nfinding a red cent. During the Revolution of July, at the funeral of\r\nGeneral Lamarque, I did not make my expenses. Give me a royal procession\r\nto make money.\" These were his politics.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say what the Duc d'Orléans would have done, had\r\nhe lived to ascend the throne. One thing is certain, however, that on\r\nthe day of his death, genuine tears stood in the eyes of all classes,\r\nexcept the Legitimists. As I have already said, they ascribed the fatal\r\naccident to God's vengeance for the usurpation of his father. \"If this\r\nbe the case,\" said an irreverent but witty journalist, \"it argues but\r\nvery little providence on the part of _your Providence_, for now He will\r\nhave to keep the peace between the Duc de Berri, the Duc de Reichstadt,\r\nand the Duc d'Orléans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n     The Revolution of '48 -- The beginning of it -- The National\r\n     Guards in all their glory -- The Café Grégoire on the Place du\r\n     Caire -- The price of a good breakfast in '48 -- The palmy days\r\n     of the Cuisine Bourgeoise -- The excitement on the Boulevards on\r\n     Sunday, February 20th, '48 -- The theatres -- A ball at\r\n     Poirson's, the erstwhile director of the Gymnase -- A lull in the\r\n     storm -- Tuesday, February 22nd -- Another visit to the Café\r\n     Grégoire -- On my way thither -- The Comédie-Française closes its\r\n     doors -- What it means, according to my old tutor -- We are\r\n     waited upon by a sergeant and corporal -- We are no longer\r\n     \"messieurs,\" but \"citoyens\" -- An eye to the main chance -- The\r\n     patriots do a bit of business in tricolour cockades -- The\r\n     company marches away -- Casualties -- \"Le patriotisme\" means the\r\n     difference between the louis d'or and the écu of three francs --\r\n     The company bivouacs on the Boulevard Saint-Martin -- A tyrant's\r\n     victim \"_malgré lui_\" -- Wednesday, February 23rd -- The Café\r\n     Grégoire once more -- The National Guards _en négligé_ -- A novel\r\n     mode of settling accounts -- The National Guards fortify the\r\n     inner man -- A bivouac on the Boulevard du Temple -- A camp scene\r\n     from an opera -- I leave -- My companion's account -- The\r\n     National Guards protect the regulars -- The author of these notes\r\n     goes to the theatre -- The Gymnase and the Variétés on the eve of\r\n     the Revolution -- Bouffé and Déjazet -- Thursday, February 24th,\r\n     '48 -- The Boulevards at 9.30 a.m. -- No milk -- The\r\n     Revolutionaries do without it -- The Place du Carrousel -- The\r\n     sovereign people fire from the roofs on the troops -- The troops\r\n     do not dislodge them -- The King reviews the troops -- The\r\n     apparent inactivity of Louis-Philippe's sons -- A theory about\r\n     the difference in bloodshed -- One of the three ugliest men in\r\n     France comes to see the King -- Seditious cries -- The King\r\n     abdicates -- Chaos -- The sacking of the Tuileries -- Receptions\r\n     and feasting in the Galerie de Diane -- \"Du café pour nous, des\r\n     cigarettes pour les dames\" -- The dresses of the princesses --\r\n     The bourgeois feast the gamins who guard the barricades -- The\r\n     Republic proclaimed -- The riff-raff insist upon illuminations --\r\n     An actor promoted to the Governorship of the Hôtel de Ville --\r\n     Some members of the \"provisional Government\" at work -- Méry on\r\n     Lamartine -- Why the latter proclaimed the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was returning home earlier than usual on Saturday night, the 19th of\r\nFebruary, '48, when, at the corner of the Rue Lafitte, I happened to run\r\nagainst a young Englishman who had been established for some years in\r\nParis as the representative of his father, a wealthy cotton-spinner in\r\nthe north. We had frequently met before, and a cordial feeling had\r\nsprung up between us, based at first--I am bound to say--on our common\r\ncontempt for the vanity of the French.\r\n\r\n\"Come and breakfast with me to-morrow morning,\" he said; \"I fancy you\r\nwill enjoy yourself. We will breakfast in my quarter, and you will see\r\nthe National Guards in all their glory. They will muster very strong\r\nto-morrow, if it be fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why to-morrow?\" I replied. \"I was under the impression that the\r\nidea of the Reformist banquet in the Champs-Élysées had been abandoned,\r\nso there will be no occasion for them to parade? Besides, that would be\r\non Tuesday only.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been abandoned, but if you think that it will prevent them from\r\nturning out, you are very much mistaken; at any rate, come and listen to\r\nthe preliminaries.\"\r\n\r\nI promised him to come, but I had not the slightest idea that I was\r\ngoing to witness a kind of mild prologue to a revolution.\r\n\r\nNext morning turned out very fine--balmy spring weather--and as I\r\nsauntered along the Boulevards Montmartre and Poissonnière to the place\r\nof appointment the streets were already crowded with people in their\r\nSunday clothes. The place where I was to meet my English friend was\r\nsituated in the midst of a busy quarter, scarcely anything but\r\nwarehouses where they sold laces, and flowers, and silks; something like\r\nthe neighbourhood at the back of Cheapside. The wealthy tradesmen of\r\nthose days did not live in the outskirts of Paris, as they did later on;\r\nand when my friend and I reached the principal café and restaurant on\r\nthe Place du Caire--I think it was called the Café Grégoire--there was\r\nscarcely a table vacant. The habitués were, almost to a man, National\r\nGuards, prosperous business men, considerably more anxious, as I found\r\nout in a short time, to play a political part than to maintain public\r\ntranquillity. If I remember rightly, one of them, a chemist and\r\ndruggist, who was pointed out to me then, became a deputy after the fall\r\nof the Second Empire; and I may notice en passant that this same spot\r\nwas the political hothouse which produced, afterwards, Monsieur Tirard,\r\nwho started life as a small manufacturer of imitation jewellery, and who\r\nrose to be Minister of Finances under the Third Republic.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was simply excellent, the wine genuine throughout, the\r\ncoffee and cognac all that could be wished; and, when I asked my friend\r\nto let me look at the bill, out of simple curiosity, or, rather, for the\r\nsake of comparing prices with those of the Cafés de Paris and Riche, I\r\nfound that he had spent something less than eleven francs. At the Café\r\nRiche it would have been twenty-five francs, and, at the present time,\r\none would be charged double that sum. These were the palmy days of the\r\nCuisine Française, or, to call it by another name, the Cuisine\r\nBourgeoise, for which, a few years later, a stranger in Paris would have\r\nalmost sought in vain. Luckily, however, for my enjoyment and digestive\r\norgans, I was no stranger to Paris and to the French; if I had been,\r\nboth the former would have been spoilt, the excitement of those around\r\nme being such as to lead the alien to believe that there would be an\r\ninstantaneous departure for the Tuileries, and a revival of the bloody\r\nscenes of the first revolution. It has been my lot, in after-years, to\r\nhear a great deal of political drivel in French and English, but it was\r\nsound philosophy compared to what I heard that morning. I have spoken\r\nbefore of the Hôtel des Haricots, where men like Hugo, Balzac, Béranger,\r\nand Alfred de Musset chose to be imprisoned rather than perform their\r\n_duties_ as National Guards. After that, I could fully appreciate their\r\nreluctance to be confounded with such a set of pompous wind-bags.\r\n\r\nIt came to nothing that day, but I had become interested, and made an\r\nappointment with my friend for the Tuesday, unless something should\r\nhappen in the interval. Still, I did not think that the monarchy of July\r\nwas doomed, though, on returning to the Boulevards, I could not help\r\nnoticing that the excitement had considerably increased during the time\r\nI had been at breakfast. By twelve o'clock that night I was convinced\r\nthat I had been mistaken, and that the dynasty of the D'Orléans had not\r\na week to live. All the theatres were still open, but I had an\r\ninvitation to a ball, given by Poirson, the then late director of the\r\nGymnase Théâtre, at his house in the Faubourg Poissonnière. \"Nous ne\r\ndanserons plus jamais sous Louis-Philippe!\" was the general cry, which\r\ndid not prevent the guests from thoroughly enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Monday, there seemed to be a lull in the storm, but on the\r\nTuesday the signs of the coming hurricane were plainly visible on the\r\nhorizon. The Ministry of Marine was guarded by a company of linesmen. I\r\nhad some business in the Rue de Rivoli, which at that time ended almost\r\nabruptly at the Louvre; and, on my way to the Café Grégoire, I met\r\npatrol upon patrol of National Guards beating the \"assembly.\" I had\r\noccasion to pass before the Comédie-Française. The ominous\r\nblack-lettered slip of yellow paper, with the word _Relâche_, was pasted\r\nacross the evening's bill. That was enough for me. I remembered the\r\nwords of my old tutor: \"When the Comédie-Française shuts its doors in\r\nperilous times, it is like the battening down of the hatches in dirty\r\nweather. There is mischief brewing.\" When I got to the Place du Caire, I\r\nwas virtually in the thick of it. With the exception of my friend and I,\r\nthere was not a man in mufti. Even the proprietor had donned his\r\nuniform. Our fillet of beef was brought to us by a corporal, and our\r\ncoffee poured out by a sergeant. Whether these warrior-waiters meant to\r\nstrike one blow for freedom and to leave the place to take care of\r\nitself, we were unable to make out; but their patrons were no longer\r\n\"messieurs,\" but had already become \"citoyens.\" I was tempted to say, in\r\nthe words of Dupin--the one who was President of the Chamber on the day\r\nof the Coup d'État, and who was Louis-Philippe's personal friend,\r\n\"Soyons citoyens, mais restons messieurs,\" but I thought it better not.\r\nMy friend had given up all idea of attending to business. \"It will not\r\nbe of the least use,\" he said. \"If I had ribbons to sell instead of\r\ncottons, I might make a lot of money, though; for I am open to wager\r\nthat some of our patriotic neighbours, while they are going to bell the\r\ncat outside, have given orders to their workpeople to manufacture\r\ntricolour cockades and rosettes with the magic R. F. (République\r\nFrançaise) in the centre.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not mean that they would think of such a thing at such a\r\ncritical moment, even if the republic were a greater probability than it\r\nappears to be?\" I remonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"I do mean to say so,\" he replied, beckoning at the same time to a\r\nsleek, corpulent lieutenant, standing a few paces away. \"Can you do with\r\na nice lot of narrow silk ribbon?\" he asked, as the individual walked up\r\nto our table.\r\n\r\n\"What colour?\" inquired the lieutenant.\r\n\r\nMy friend gave me a significant look, and named all the hues of the\r\nrainbow except white, red, and blue.\r\n\r\n\"Won't do,\" said the lieutenant, shaking his head. \"If it had been red,\r\nwhite, and blue I would have bought as much as you like, because I am\r\nmanufacturing rosettes for the good cause.\" After this he walked away.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday afternoon the Boulevards and principal thoroughfares\r\nswarmed with peripatetic vendors of the republican insignia, and some\r\nof my friends expressed their surprise as to where they had come from in\r\nso short a time. Seeing that they were Frenchmen, I held my tongue, even\r\nwhen one professed to explain, \"They have come from England; they are\r\nalways speculating upon our misfortunes, though they do it cleverly\r\nenough. They got scent of what was coming, and sent them over as quickly\r\nas they could. Truly they are a great nation--of shopkeepers!\" I was\r\nreminded of Béranger's scapegrace, when he was accused of being drunk.\r\n\r\n  \"Qu'est que cela me fait, à moi?\r\n   Que l'on m'appelle ivrogne?\"\r\n\r\nhe sings.\r\n\r\nAs the afternoon wore on, the excitement increased; the news from the\r\nBoulevards became alarming, and at about three o'clock the company\r\nmarched away. As a matter of course we followed, and equally, as a\r\nmatter of course, did not leave them until 2.30 next morning. Casualties\r\nto report. A large scratch in one of the drummer's cheeks, made by an\r\noyster-shell, flung at the company as it turned round the corner of the\r\nRue de Cléry. No battles, no skirmishes, a great deal of fraternizing\r\nwith \"le peuple souverain,\" whom, in their own employ, the well-to-do\r\ntradesmen would have ordered about like so many mangy curs.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forth I have never dipped into any history of modern\r\nFrance, professing to deal with the political causes and effects of the\r\nvarious upheavals during the nineteenth century in France. They may be\r\nworth reading; I do not say that they are not. I have preferred to look\r\nat the men who instigated those disorders, and have come to the\r\nconclusion that, had each of them been born with five or ten thousand a\r\nyear, their names would have been absolutely wanting in connection with\r\nthem. This does not mean that the disorders would not have taken place,\r\nbut they would have always been led by men in want of five or ten\r\nthousand a year. On the other hand, if the D'Orléans family had been\r\nless wealthy than they are there would have been no firmly settled third\r\nrepublic; if Louis-Napoléon had been less poor, there would, in all\r\nprobability, have been no second empire; if the latter had lasted\r\nanother year, we should have found Gambetta among the ministers of\r\nNapoléon III., just like Émile Ollivier, of the \"light heart.\" \"Les\r\nconvictions politiques en France sont basées sur le fait que le louis\r\nd'or vaut sept fois plus que l'écu de trois francs.\" This is the dictum\r\nof a man who never wished to be anything, who steadfastly refused all\r\noffers to enter the arena of public life.\r\n\r\nMy friend and I had been baulked of the drama we expected--for we\r\nfrankly confessed to one another that the utter annihilation of that\r\ncompany of National Guards would have left us perfectly unmoved,--and\r\ngot instead, a kind of first act of a military spectacular play, such as\r\nwe were in the habit of seeing at Franconi's. The civic warriors were\r\nostensibly bivouacking on the Boulevard St. Martin; they stacked their\r\nmuskets and fraternized with the crowd; it would not have surprised us\r\nin the least to see a troupe of ballet dancers advance into our midst\r\nand give us the entertainment de rigueur--the intermède. It was the only\r\nthing wanting to complete the picture, from which even the low comedy\r\nincident was not wanting. An old woebegone creature, evidently the worse\r\nfor liquor, had fallen down while a patrol of regulars was passing. He\r\nwas not a bit hurt; but there and then the rabble proposed to carry him\r\nto the Hôtel de Ville, and to give him an apotheosis as a martyr to the\r\ncause. They had already fetched a stretcher, and were, notwithstanding\r\nhis violent struggles, hoisting him on it, when prevented by the captain\r\nof the National Guards.\r\n\r\nStill, we returned next day to the Café Grégoire. In the middle of the\r\nplace there lay an old man--that one, stark dead, who had been fired\r\nupon without rhyme or reason by a picket of the National Guards. It was\r\nonly about eleven o'clock, and those valiant defenders of public order\r\nwere still resting from their fatigue--at any rate, there were few of\r\nthem about. There was a discussion going on whether they should go out\r\nor not--a discussion confined to the captain, two lieutenants, and as\r\nmany sub-lieutenants. They appeared not to have the least idea of the\r\nnecessity to refer for orders to the colonel or the head-quarters of the\r\nregiment or the legion, as it was called. They meant to settle the\r\nmatter among themselves. The great argument in favour of calling out the\r\nmen was that one of them, while standing at his window that very\r\nmorning, was fired at by a passing ragamuffin, who, instead of hitting\r\nhim, shattered his windowpanes.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said one of the lieutenants, who had been opposed to the calling\r\nout of the men, \"then we are quits after all; for look at the old fellow\r\nlying out there.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we are not,\" retorts the captain; \"for he was shot by a mistake, so\r\nhe doesn't count.\"\r\n\r\n\"L'esprit ne perd jamais ses droits en France;\" so, in another moment or\r\ntwo, the bugle sounded lustily throughout the quarter. We followed the\r\nbuglers for a little while, it being still too early for our breakfast,\r\nand consequently enjoyed the felicity of seeing a good many of the\r\nwarriors \"in their habit as they lived\" indoors--namely, in\r\ndressing-gown and slippers and smoking-caps. For most of them opened\r\ntheir windows on the first, second, and third floors, to inquire whether\r\nthe call was urgent. The buglers entered into explanations. No, the call\r\nwas not urgent, but the captain had decided on a military promenade,\r\njust to reassure the neighbourhood, and to stimulate the martial spirit\r\nof the lagging members of the company. The explanation invariably\r\nprovoked the same answer, and in a voice not that of the\r\ncitizen-warrior: \"Que le capitaine attende jusqu'après le déjeûner.\"\r\n\r\nDavoust has said that the first condition of the fitness of an army is\r\nits commissariat. In that respect every one of these National Guards was\r\nfit to be a Davoust, for their fortifying of the inner man was not\r\naccomplished until close upon two o'clock. By that time they marched\r\nout, saluted by the cries of \"Vive la Réforme!\" of all the ragtag and\r\nbobtail from the Faubourgs du Temple and St. Antoine, who had invaded\r\nthe principal thoroughfares. The \"Marseillaise,\" the \"Chant des\r\nGirondins,\" \"La République nous appelle\" resounded through the air; and\r\nI was wondering whether they were packing their trunks at the Tuileries,\r\nalso what these National Guards had come out for. They only seemed to\r\nimpede the efficient patrolling of the streets by the regulars, and,\r\ninstead of dispersing the rabble, they attracted them. They were\r\nevidently under the impression that they made a very goodly show, and at\r\nevery word of command I expected to see the captain burst asunder. When\r\nwe got to the Boulevard St. Martin, the latter was told that the sixth\r\nlegion was stationed on the Boulevard du Temple. A move was made in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nNow \"Richard is himself again;\" he is among the crowd he likes best--the\r\ncrowd of the Boulevard du Crime, with its theatres, large and small, its\r\nraree and puppet shows, its open-air entertainments, its cafés and\r\nmountebanks; and, what is more, he is there in his uniform,\r\ndistinguished from the rest, and consequently the cynosure of all the\r\nlittle actresses and pretty _figurantes_ who have just left the\r\nrehearsal--for by this time it is after three--and who are but too\r\nwilling to be entertained. Appointments are made to dine or to sup\r\ntogether, without the slightest reference as to what may happen in the\r\ninterval. All at once there is an outcry and a rush towards the Porte\r\nSaint-Martin; our warriors are obliged to leave their inamoratas, and\r\nwhen they come to look for their muskets, which they have placed in a\r\ncorner for convenience' sake, they find that a good many have\r\ndisappeared. The customers belonging to the sovereign people have slunk\r\noff with them. Nevertheless they join the ranks, for the bugle has\r\nsounded. At the corner of the Faubourg Saint-Martin, whence the noise\r\nproceeded, they are met by three or four score of the sovereign people,\r\nragged, unkempt, who are pushing in front of them two of the students of\r\nthe École Polytechnique. The two young fellows are very pale, and can\r\nscarcely speak. Still they manage to explain that the Municipal Guard at\r\nthe Saint-Martin barracks have fired upon the people; then they go their\r\nway. Whither? Heaven only knows. But our captain, in the most stentorian\r\nof voices, gives the word of command, \"To the right, wheel!\" and we are\r\nstriding up the faubourg, which is absolutely deserted as far as the Rue\r\ndes Marais. A collision seems pretty inevitable now, the more that the\r\nMunicipal Guards are already taking aim, when all at once our captain\r\nand one of the lieutenants rush forward, and fling themselves into the\r\narms of the officers of the Municipal Guards. Tableau; and I am baulked\r\nonce more of a good fight. I leave my friend to see the rest of this\r\nridiculous comedy, and take my departure there and then.\r\n\r\nThe following is my companion's account of what happened after I left. I\r\nam as certain that every word of it is true as if I had been there\r\nmyself, though it seems almost incredible that French officers, whose\r\nworst enemies have never accused them of being deficient in courage,\r\nshould have acted so inconsiderately.\r\n\r\n\"The officers of the National Guards appear to have assumed at once the\r\noffice of protectors of the regulars against the violence of the crowd.\r\nWhy the regulars should have submitted to this, seeing that they were\r\nfar better armed than their would-be guardians, I am unable to say. Be\r\nthis as it may, the regulars consented, the flag floating above the\r\nprincipal door of the barracks was taken down, and I really believe\r\nthat the Municipal Guards stacked their arms and virtually handed them\r\nover to the others. But I will not vouch for it. At any rate, a few\r\nhours afterwards, while the company had gone to dinner, the barracks\r\nwere assailed, the men and officers knocked down by the people, and the\r\nbuilding set on fire. When the fifth legion returned about eleven\r\no'clock to the Faubourg Saint-Martin, the flames were leaping up to the\r\nsky, so they turned their heels contentedly in the direction of the\r\nBoulevard du Temple, where they bivouacked between the Théâtre de la\r\nGaîté and the Ambigu-Comique, while those who had made appointments with\r\nthe little actresses went round by the stage doors to keep them. That,\r\nas far as I could judge, was the part of the fifth legion in the day's\r\nproceedings. I left them in all their glory, thinking themselves, no\r\ndoubt, very fine fellows.\r\n\r\n\"On the Thursday morning\"--my companion told me all this on Saturday\r\nevening, the 26th of February--\"I was up betimes, simply because the\r\ndrumming and bugling prevented my sleeping. At eight, the Café Grégoire\r\nwas already very full, the heroes of the previous night had returned to\r\nperform their ablutions, and also, I suppose, to reassure their anxious\r\nspouses; but they had no longer that conquering air I noticed when I\r\nleft them the night before. Whether they had come to the conclusion that\r\nboth in love and war they had reaped but barren victories, I cannot say,\r\nbut their republican ardour, it seemed to me, had considerably cooled\r\ndown. I am convinced that, notwithstanding the events of Wednesday night\r\nin the Faubourg Saint-Martin, they were under the impression that\r\nneither the people nor the military would resort to further extremities.\r\nI cannot help thinking that, after I left, not a single man could have\r\nremained at his post, because not one amongst them seemed to have an\r\nidea of the horrible slaughter on the Boulevard des Capucines.[44] They\r\nwere not left very long in ignorance of the real state of affairs, and\r\nthen they saw at once that they had roused a spectre they would be\r\nunable to lay. From that moment, it is my opinion, they would have\r\nwillingly drawn back, but it was too late. While they were still\r\ndebating, an individual rushed in, telling them that one or two\r\nregiments, commanded by a general (who turned out to be General Bedeau),\r\nhad drawn up in front of the barricade which had been thrown up during\r\nthe night in the Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle, and was being defended by a\r\ndetachment of the fifth legion. They all ran out, and I ran with them.\r\nWhen we got to the boulevard, matters had already been arranged, and\r\nthey were just in time to join the escort General Bedeau had accepted,\r\nafter having consented not to execute the orders with which he had been\r\nentrusted. By that time I began to perceive which way the wind was\r\nblowing: the canaille had unceremoniously linked their arms in those of\r\nthe National Guards, and insisted, courteously but firmly, on carrying\r\ntheir firearms. When we got to the Rue Montmartre, they took the horses\r\nout of the gun-carriages, and the soldiers looked tamely on,\r\nnotwithstanding the commands of their officers. When the latter\r\nendeavoured to enforce their orders by hitting them with the flat of\r\ntheir swords, they simply left the ranks and joined the rabble. I had\r\nhad enough of it, and made my way home by the back streets. I had had\r\nenough of it, and kept indoors until this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 44: The author, as will be seen directly, saw nothing\r\n         of that massacre, though he must have passed within a few\r\n         hundred yards of the spot immediately before it began. It would\r\n         have been the same if he had; he could not have explained the\r\n         cause, seeing that the most painstaking historians who have\r\n         consulted the most trustworthy eye-witnesses have failed to do\r\n         so. It will always remain a mystery whence the first shot came,\r\n         whether from the military who were drawn up across the\r\n         Boulevard des Capucines, on the spot where now stands the Grand\r\n         Café, or from the crowd that wanted to pass, in order to\r\n         proceed to Odilon-Barrot's to serenade him, because,\r\n         notwithstanding the opposition of the king, he was to be\r\n         included in the new ministry, which Molé had been instructed to\r\n         form. It may safely be said, however, that, but for that shot\r\n         and the slaughter consequent upon it, the revolution might have\r\n         been averted then--after all, perhaps, only\r\n         temporarily.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThus far my informant. As for myself, I saw little on the Wednesday\r\nnight of what was going on. It was my own fault: I was too optimistic. I\r\nhad scarcely gone a few steps, after my dinner, when, just in front of\r\nthe Gymnase, they began shouting, \"_La Patrie, Journal du soir_; achetez\r\n_La Patrie_. Voyez le nouveau ministère de Monsieur Molé.\" I remember\r\ngiving the fellow half a franc, at which he grumbled, though it was\r\nthree times the ordinary price. On opening the paper, I rashly concluded\r\nfrom what I read that the revolution was virtually at an end, and I was\r\nthe more confirmed in my opinion by the almost instantaneous lighting up\r\nof the Boulevards. It was like a fairy scene: people were\r\nilluminating--a little bit too soon, as it turned out. Being tired of\r\nwandering, and feeling no inclination for bed, I turned into the\r\nGymnase. There were Bressant and Rose Chéri and Arnal; I would surely be\r\nable to spend a few pleasant hours. But alack and alas! the house\r\npresented a very doleful appearance--dead-heads, to a man; and very few\r\nof these, people who, if they could not fiddle themselves, like Nero\r\nwhile Rome was burning, would go to hear fiddling under no matter what\r\ncircumstances, provided they were not asked to pay. I did not stay long,\r\nbut when I came out into the streets the noise was too deafening for me.\r\nThe \"Marseillaise\" has always had a particularly jarring effect upon my\r\nnerves. There are days when I could be cruel enough to prefer \"the yells\r\nof those ferocious soldiers, as they murder in cold blood the sons and\r\nthe companions\" of one section of defenceless patriots, to the stirring\r\nstrains of the other section as they figuratively rush to the rescue;\r\nand on that particular evening I felt in that mood. So, when I got to\r\nthe Boulevard Montmartre, I turned into the Théâtre des Variétés. I\r\nremember the programme up to this day. They were playing \"Le Suisse de\r\nMarly,\" \"Le Marquis de Lauzun,\" \"Les Extrêmes se touchent,\" and \"Les\r\nVieux Péchés.\" I had seen the second and the last piece at least a dozen\r\ntimes, but I was always ready to see them again for the sake of Virginie\r\nDéjazet in the one, of Bouffé in the other. The lessee at that time was\r\nan Englishman. Bouffé and I had always kept up our friendship; so I made\r\nup my mind to go and have a chat with him, hoping that Déjazet, whose\r\nconversation affected one like a bottle of champagne, would join us. The\r\nhouse, like the Gymnase, was almost empty, but I made my way behind the\r\nscenes, and in about half an hour forgot all about the events outside.\r\nBouffé was telling me anecdotes about his London performances, and\r\nDéjazet was imitating the French of some of the bigwigs of King\r\nLeopold's court; so the time passed pleasantly enough. At the end of the\r\nperformance we proposed taking supper, and turned down the Rue\r\nMontmartre. It was late when I returned home, consequently I saw nothing\r\nof the slaughter on the Boulevard des Capucines.\r\n\r\nThough I had gone to bed late, I was up betimes on the Thursday morning.\r\nA glance at the Boulevards, as I turned the corner of my street about\r\nhalf-past nine, convinced me that the illuminations of the previous\r\nnight had been premature, and that before the day was out there would be\r\nan end of the monarchy of July. A slight mist was still hanging over\r\nthe city as I strolled in the direction of the Madeleine, and the\r\nweather was damp and raw, but in about half an hour the sun broke\r\nthrough. A shot was heard now and then, but I myself saw no collision\r\nthen between the troops and the people. On the contrary, it looked to me\r\nas if the former would have been glad to be left alone. As I had been\r\nobliged to leave home without my usual cup of tea for want of milk--the\r\nservant had told me there was none--I went back a little way to\r\nTortoni's, where I was greeted with the same answer. I could have tea or\r\ncoffee or chocolate made with water, but milk there was none on that\r\nside of Paris, and, unless things took a turn, there would be no butter.\r\nThe sovereign people had thrown up barricades during the night round all\r\nthe northern and north-western issues, and would not let the milk-carts\r\npass. They, no doubt, had some more potent fluids to fall back upon, for\r\na good many, even at that early hour, were by no means steady in their\r\ngait. The Boulevards were swarming with them. Since then, I have seen\r\nthese sovereign people getting the upper hand twice, viz. on the 4th of\r\nSeptember, '70, and on the 18th of March, '71. I have seen them during\r\nthe siege of Paris, and I have no hesitation in saying that, for\r\ncold-blooded, apish, monkeyish, tigerish cruelty, there is nothing on\r\nthe face of God's earth to match them, and that no concessions wrung\r\nfrom society on their behalf will ever make them anything else but the\r\nfiends in human shape they are.\r\n\r\nAfter my fruitless attempt to get my accustomed breakfast, I resumed my\r\nperambulations, this time taking the Rue Vivienne as far as the\r\nPalais-Royal. It must have been between half-past ten and eleven when I\r\nreached the Place du Carrousel, which, at a rough guess, was occupied by\r\nabout five thousand regular infantry and horse and National Guards. The\r\nPlace du Carrousel was not then, what it became later on, a large open\r\nspace. Part of it was encumbered with narrow streets of very tall\r\nhouses, and from their windows and roofs the sovereign people--according\r\nto an officer who had been on duty from early morn--had been amusing\r\nthemselves by firing on the troops,--not in downright volleys, but with\r\nisolated shots, picking out a man here and there. \"But,\" I remonstrated,\r\n\"half a dozen pompiers and a score of linesmen could dislodge them in\r\nless than ten minutes, instead of returning their shots one by one.\" \"So\r\nthey could,\" was the reply, \"but orders came from the Château not to do\r\nso, and here we are. Besides,\" added my informant, \"I doubt very much,\r\nif I gave my men the word of command to storm the place, whether they\r\nwould do so; they are thoroughly demoralized. On our way hither I had\r\nthe greatest difficulty in keeping them together. Without a roll-call I\r\ncould not exactly tell you how many are missing, but as we came along I\r\nnoticed several falling out and going into the wine-shops with the\r\nrabble. They did not come back again. I had to shut my eyes to it. If I\r\nhad attempted to prevent it, there would have been a more horrible\r\nslaughter than there was last night on the Boulevards, and, what is\r\nworse, the men who remained staunch would have been in a minority, and\r\nnot able to stand their ground. The mob have got hold of the muskets of\r\nthe National Guards. I dare say, as you came along, you noticed on many\r\ndoors, written up in chalk, 'Arms given up,' and on some the words 'with\r\npleasure' added to the statement.\" It was perfectly true; I had noticed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI was still talking to the captain when the drums began to beat and the\r\nbuglers sounded the salute. At the same moment I saw the King, in the\r\nuniform of a general of the National Guards, cross the courtyard on\r\nhorseback. I noticed a great many ladies at the ground-floor windows of\r\nthe palace, but could not distinguish their faces. I was told afterwards\r\nthat they were the Queen and the princesses, endeavouring to encourage\r\nthe septuagenarian monarch. Louis-Philippe was seventy-five then.\r\n\r\nI have often heard and seen it stated by historians of the revolution of\r\n'48, that the Duke d'Aumale and the Prince de Joinville, had they been\r\nin Paris, would have saved their father's crown. This is an assumption\r\nwhich it is difficult to disprove, seeing how popular these young\r\nprinces were then. But if the assumption is meant to convey that the mob\r\nat the sight of these brave young fellows would have laid down their\r\narms without fighting, I can unhesitatingly contradict it. What the\r\nNational Guard might have done it is impossible to say. The regulars, no\r\ndoubt, would have followed the princes into battle, as they would have\r\nfollowed their brother, De Nemours, notwithstanding the latter's\r\nunpopularity. There would have been a great deal of bloodshed, but the\r\nlast word would have remained with the Government. Louis-Philippe's\r\ngreatest title to glory is that of having prevented such bloodshed. But\r\nto show how little such abnegation of self is understood by even the\r\nmost educated Frenchmen, I must relate a story which was told to me many\r\nyears afterwards by a French officer who, at that time, had just\r\nreturned from the Pontifical States, where he had helped to defeat the\r\nsmall army of Garibaldi. He was describing the battle-field of Mentana\r\nto Napoléon III., and mentioned a prisoner he had made who turned out to\r\nbe an old acquaintance from the Boulevards. \"He was furious against\r\nGaribaldi, sire,\" said the officer, \"because the latter had placed him\r\nin the necessity, as it were, of firing upon his own countrymen in a\r\nstrange land. Said the prisoner, 'I am not an émigré; I would not have\r\ngone to Coblenz; I am a Frenchman from the crown of my head to the sole\r\nof my foot. If it came to fighting my countrymen in the streets of\r\nParis, that would be a different thing. I should not have the slightest\r\nscruple of firing upon the Imperial Guards or upon the rabble, as the\r\ncase might be, for that would be civil war.' That's what he said, sire.\"\r\n\r\nNapoléon nodded his head, and with his wonderful, sphinxlike smile,\r\nreplied, \"Your prisoner was right; it makes all the difference.\" The\r\nOrléans princes, save perhaps one, never knew these distinctions; if\r\nthey had known them, the Comte de Paris might be King of France to-day.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to Louis-Philippe as I saw him at the last\r\nmoments of his reign. He felt evidently disappointed at the lukewarm\r\nreception he received, for though there was a faint cry among the\r\nregulars of \"Vive le Roi!\" it was immediately drowned by the stentorian\r\none of the rabble of \"Vive la Réforme!\" in which a good many of the\r\nNational Guards joined. He was evidently in a hurry to get back to the\r\nTuileries, and, when he disappeared in the doorway, I had looked upon\r\nhim for the last time in my life. An hour and a half later, he had left\r\nParis for ever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPersonally I saw nothing of the flight of the King, nor of the inside of\r\nthe Tuileries, until the royal family were gone. The story of that\r\nflight was told to me several years later by the Duc de Montpensier.\r\nWhat is worse, in those days it never entered my mind that a time would\r\ncome when I should feel desirous of committing my reminiscences to\r\npaper, consequently I kept no count of the hours that went by, and\r\ncannot, therefore, give the exact sequence of events. I do not know how\r\nlong I stood among the soldiers and the crowd, scarcely divided from\r\none another even by an imaginary line. It was not a pleasant crowd,\r\nthough to my great surprise there were a great many more decently\r\ndressed persons in it than I could have expected, so I stayed on. About\r\nhalf an hour after the King re-entered the Tuileries, I noticed two\r\ngentlemen elbow their way through the serried masses. I had no\r\ndifficulty in recognizing the one in civilian's clothes. Though he was\r\nby no means so famous as he became afterwards, there was hardly a\r\nParisian who would not have recognized him on the spot. His portrait had\r\nbeen drawn over and over again, at least as many times as that of the\r\nKing, and it is a positive fact that nurses frightened their babies with\r\nit. He was the ugliest man of the century. It was M. Adolphe\r\nCremieux.[45] His companion was in uniform. I learnt afterwards that it\r\nwas General Gourgaud, but I did not know him then except by name, and in\r\nconnection with his polemics with the Duke of Wellington, in which the\r\nlatter did not altogether behave with the generosity one expects from an\r\nEnglish gentleman towards a fallen foe. As they passed, the old soldier\r\nmust have been recognized, because not one, but at least a hundred cries\r\nresounded, \"Vive la grande armée! Vive l'Empereur!\" In after years I\r\nthought that these cries sounded almost prophetic, though I am pretty\r\nsure that those who uttered them had not the slightest hope of, and\r\nperhaps not even a desire for, a Napoleonic restoration; at any rate,\r\nnot the majority. There is one thing, however, which could not have\r\nfailed to strike the impartial observer during the next twenty years. I\r\nhave seen a good many riots, small and large, during the Second Republic\r\nand the Second Empire. \"Seditious cries,\" as a matter of course, were\r\nfreely shouted. I have never heard a single one of \"Vivent les\r\nD'Orléans!\" or \"Vivent les Bourbons!\" I have already spoken more than\r\nonce about the powerful influence of the Napoleonic legend in those\r\ndays; I shall have occasion to refer to it again and again when speaking\r\nabout the nephew of the first Napoléon.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 45: The author is slightly mistaken. The two ugliest\r\n         men in France in the nineteenth century were Andrieux, who\r\n         wrote \"Les Étourdis,\" and Littré; but Cremieux ran them very\r\n         hard.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nCremieux and Gourgaud could not have been inside the Tuileries more than\r\na quarter of an hour when they rushed out again. They evidently made a\r\ncommunication to the troops, because I beheld the latter waving their\r\narms, but, of course, I did not catch a word of what they said; I was\r\ntoo far away. It was, I learnt afterwards, the announcement of the\r\nadvent of a new ministry, and the appointment of a new commander of the\r\nNational Guards. When I saw hats and caps flung into the air, and heard\r\nthe people shouting, I made certain that the revolution was at an end. I\r\nwas mistaken. It was not Cremieux's communication at all that had\r\nprovoked the enthusiasm; it was a second communication, made by some one\r\nfrom the doorway of the Tuileries immediately after the eminent\r\nbarrister had disappeared among the crowd, to the effect that the King\r\nhad abdicated in favour of the Comte de Paris, with the Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans as regent. Between the first and second announcements there\r\ncould not have elapsed more than five or six minutes, ten at the utmost,\r\nbecause, before I had time to recover from my surprise, I saw Cremieux\r\nand Gourgaud battle through the tightly wedged masses once more, and\r\nre-enter the Tuileries to verify the news. I am writing this note\r\nespecially by the light of subsequent information, for, I repeat, it was\r\nimpossible to understand events succinctly by the quickly succeeding\r\neffects they produced at the time. Another ten minutes elapsed--ten\r\nminutes which I shall never forget, because every one of the thousands\r\npresent on the Place du Carrousel was in momentary danger of having the\r\nlife crushed out of him. It was no one's fault; there was, if I\r\nrecollect rightly, but one narrow issue on the river-side, and there was\r\na dense seething mass standing on the banks, notwithstanding the danger\r\nof that position, for the insurgents were firing freely and recklessly\r\nacross the stream. Egress on the opposite side of the Place du\r\nCarrousel, that of the Place du Palais-Royal, had become absolutely\r\nimpossible, for at that moment a fierce battle was raging there between\r\nthe people and the National Guards for the possession of the military\r\npost of the Château d'Eau;[46] and those of the non-combatants who did\r\nnot think it necessary to pay for the fall or the maintenance of the\r\nmonarchy of July with life or limb, tried to get out of the bullets'\r\nreach. There was but one way of doing so, by a stampede in a southerly\r\ndirection; the Rue de Rivoli, at any rate that part which existed, was\r\nentirely blocked to the west, the congeries of streets that have been\r\npulled down since to make room for its prolongation to the east were\r\nbristling with barricades: hence the terrible, suffocating crush, in\r\nwhich several persons lost their lives. The most curious incident\r\nconnected with these awful ten minutes was that of a woman and her baby.\r\nWhen Cremieux issued for the second time from the Tuileries, it was to\r\nconfirm the news of the King's abdication. Almost immediately\r\nafterwards, the masses on the quay were making for the Place de la\r\nConcorde and the Palais-Bourbon, whither, it was rumoured, the Duchesse\r\nD'Orléans and her two sons were going; and gradually the wedged-in mass\r\non the Place du Carrousel found breathing space. Then the woman was seen\r\nto fall down like a ninepin that has been toppled over; she was dead,\r\nbut her baby, which she had held above the crowd, and which they had, as\r\nit were, to wrench from her grasp, was alive and well.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 46: So called after a large ornamental fountain; the\r\n         same, I believe, which subsequently was transferred to what is\r\n         now called the Place de la République, and which finally found\r\n         its way to the Avenue Daumesnil, where it stands at\r\n         present.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nI stood for a little while longer on the Place du Carrousel, trying to\r\nmake up my mind whether to proceed to the Place de la Concorde or to the\r\nPlace de l'Hôtel de Ville. I knew that the newly-elected powers,\r\nwhosoever they might be, would make their appearance at the latter spot,\r\nbut how long it would be before they came, I had not the least idea. I\r\nwas determined, however, to see at any rate one act of the drama or the\r\nfarce; for even then there was no knowing in what guise events would\r\npresent themselves. I could hear the reports of firearms on both sides\r\nof me, though why there should be firing when the King had thrown up the\r\nsponge, I could not make out for the life of me. I did not know France\r\nso well then as I know her now. I did not know then that there is no man\r\nor, for that matter, no woman on the civilized earth so heedlessly and\r\nobdurately bloodthirsty when he or she works himself into a fury as the\r\nprofessedly débonnaire Parisian proletarian. Nevertheless, I decided to\r\ngo to the Hôtel de Ville, and had carefully worked my way as far as the\r\nsite of the present Place du Châtelet, when I was compelled to retrace\r\nmy steps. The élite of the Paris scum was going to dictate its will to\r\nthe new Government; it was marching to the Chamber of Deputies with\r\nbanners flying. One of the latter was a red-and-white striped flannel\r\npetticoat, fastened to a tremendously long pole. I had no choice, and if\r\nat that moment my friends had seen me they might have easily imagined\r\nthat I had become one of the leaders of the revolutionary mob. We took\r\nby the Quai de la Mégisserie, and just before the Pont des Arts there\r\nwas a momentary halt. The vanguard, which I was apparently leading, had\r\ndecided to turn to the right; in other words, to visit the abode of the\r\nhated tyrant. Had I belonged to the main division, I should have\r\nwitnessed a really more important scene, from the historical point of\r\nview; as it was, I witnessed--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SACKING OF THE TUILERIES.\r\n\r\nThe idea that \"there is a divinity that hedgeth round a king\" seemed, I\r\nadmit, preposterous enough at that moment; but I could not help being\r\nstruck with its partial truth on seeing the rabble invade the palace.\r\nWhen I say the rabble, I mean the rabble, though there were a great many\r\npersons whom it would be an insult to class as such, and who from sheer\r\ncuriosity, or because they could not help themselves, had gone in with\r\nthem. The doors proved too narrow, and those who could not enter by that\r\nway, entered by the windows. The whole contingent of the riff-raff, male\r\nand female, weltering in the adjacent streets--and such streets!--was\r\nthere. Well, for the first ten minutes they stood positively motionless,\r\nnot daring to touch anything. It was not the fear of being caught\r\npilfering and punished summarily that prevented them. The minority which\r\nmight have protested was so utterly insignificant in numbers, as to make\r\naction on their part impossible. No, it was neither fear nor shame that\r\nstayed the rabble's hands; it was a sentiment for which I can find no\r\nname. It was the consciousness that these objects had belonged to a\r\nking, to a royal family, which made them gaze upon them in a kind of\r\nsuperstitious wonder. It did not last long. We were on the ground floor,\r\nwhich mainly consisted of the private apartments of the household of\r\nLouis-Philippe. We were wandering, or rather squeezing, through the\r\nstudy and bedroom of the King himself, through the sitting-rooms of the\r\nprinces and princesses. I do not think that a single thing was taken\r\nfrom there at that particular time. But as if the atmosphere their\r\nrulers had breathed but so very recently became too oppressive, the\r\ncrowd swayed towards the vestibule, and ascended the grand staircase.\r\nThen the spell was broken. The second batch that entered through the\r\nwindows, when we had made room for them, were apparently not affected\r\nby wonder and respect, for, half an hour later, when I came down again,\r\nevery cupboard, every wardrobe, had been forced, though it is but fair\r\nto say that very little seems to have been taken; the contents, books,\r\nclothing, linen, etc., were scattered on the floors; but the cellars,\r\ncontaining over four thousand bottles of wine, were positively empty.\r\nTwo hours later, however, the clothing, especially that of the\r\nprincesses, had totally disappeared. It had disappeared on the backs of\r\nthe inmates of St. Lazare, the doors of which had been thrown open, and\r\nwho had rushed to the Tuileries to deck themselves with these fine\r\nfeathers which, in this instance, did not make fine birds. I saw some of\r\nthem that same evening on the Boulevards, and a more heart-rending\r\nspectacle I have rarely beheld.\r\n\r\nThe three hours I spent at the Tuileries were so crowded with events as\r\nto make a succinct account of them altogether impossible. I can only\r\ngive fragments, because, though at first the wearers of broadcloth were\r\nnot molested, this tolerance did not last long on the part of the new\r\npossessors of the Tuileries; and consequently the former gradually\r\ndropped off, and those of them who remained had to be very circumspect,\r\nand, above all, not to linger long in the same spot. This growing\r\nhostility might have been nipped in the bud by our following the example\r\nof the National Guards, and taking off our coats and fraternizing with\r\nthe rabble; but I frankly confess that I had neither the courage nor the\r\nstomach to do so. I have read descriptions of mutinous sailors stowing\r\nin casks of rum and gorging themselves with victuals; revolting as such\r\nscenes must be to those who take no active part in them, I doubt whether\r\nthey could be as revolting as the one I witnessed in the Gallerie de\r\nDiane.\r\n\r\nThe Galerie de Diane was one of the large reception rooms on the first\r\nfloor, but it generally served as the dining and breakfast room of the\r\nroyal family. The table had been laid for about three dozen persons,\r\nbecause, as a rule, Louis-Philippe invited the principal members of his\r\nmilitary and civil households to take their repasts with him. The\r\nbreakfast had been interrupted, and not been cleared away. When I\r\nentered the apartment some sixty or seventy ruffians of both sexes were\r\nseated at the board, while a score or so were engaged in waiting upon\r\nthem. They were endeavouring to accomplish what the Highest Authority\r\nhas declared impossible of accomplishment, namely, the making of silken\r\npurses out of sows' ears. They were \"putting on\" what they considered\r\n\"company manners,\" and, under any other circumstances but these, the\r\nattempt would have proved irresistibly comic to the educated spectator;\r\nas it was, it brought tears to one's eyes. I have already hinted\r\nelsewhere that the cuisine at the Tuileries during Louis-Philippe's\r\nreign was execrable, though the wine was generally good. Bad as was the\r\nfare on that abandoned breakfast-table, it must, nevertheless, have been\r\nsuperior to that usually partaken of by the convives who had taken the\r\nplace of the fugitive king and princes. They, the convives, however, did\r\nnot think so; they criticized the food, and ordered the improvised\r\nattendants \"to give them something different;\" then they turned to their\r\nfemale companions, filling their glasses and paying them compliments.\r\nBut for the fact of another batch eagerly claiming their turn, the\r\nrepast would have been indefinitely prolonged; as it was, the provisions\r\nin the palace were running short, and the deficiency had to be made up\r\nby supplies from outside. The inner man being refreshed, the ladies were\r\ninvited to take a stroll through the apartments, pending the serving of\r\nthe café and liqueurs. The preparation of the mocha was somewhat\r\ndifficult, seeing the utensils necessary for the supply of so large a\r\ncompany were probably not at hand, and the ingredients themselves in the\r\nstore-rooms of the palace. Nothing daunted, one of the self-invited\r\nguests rose and said, in a loud voice, \"Permettez moi d'offrir le café à\r\nla compagnie,\" which offer was received with tumultuous applause.\r\nSuiting the action to the word, he pulled out a small canvas bag, and\r\ntook from it two five-franc pieces. \"Qu'on aille chercher du café et du\r\nmeilleur,\" he said to one of the guests who had stepped forward to\r\nexecute his orders, for they sounded almost like it; and I was wondering\r\nwhy those professed champions of equality did not tell him to fetch the\r\ncoffee himself. Then he added, \"Et pendant que tu y es, citoyen, apporte\r\ndes cigares pour nous et des cigarettes pour les dames.\" The \"citoyen\"\r\nwas already starting on his errand, when the other \"citoyen\" called him\r\nback. \"Écoute,\" he said; \"tu n'acheteras rien à moins d'y être forcé. Je\r\ncrois que tu n'auras qu'à demander à la première épicerie venue ce qu'il\r\nte faut, et ainsi au premier bureau de tabac. Ils ont si peur, ces sales\r\nbourgeois qu'ils n'oseront pas te refuser. En tout cas prends un fusil;\r\non ne sait pas ce qui peut arriver; mais ne t'en sers pas qu'en cas de\r\nnecessité:\"--which meant plainly enough, \"If they refuse to give you the\r\ncoffee and the tobacco, shoot them down.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, I am unable to say how these two commodities were eventually\r\nprocured; but I have every reason to believe that this messenger had\r\nonly \"to ask and have,\" without as much as showing his musket. There is\r\nno greater cur at troublous times than the Paris shopkeeper. The merest\r\nurchin will terrify him. Even on the previous day I had seen bands of\r\ngamins who had constituted themselves the guardians of the\r\nbarricades--and there was one in nearly every street--levy toll without\r\nthe slightest resistance, when a few well-administered cuffs would have\r\nsent them flying, so I have not the slightest doubt that our friend had\r\nall the credit of his generosity without disbursing a penny--unless his\r\ndelegate fleeced him also, on the theory that a man who could \"fork out\"\r\nten francs at a moment's notice was nothing more or less than a\r\nbourgeois. However, when I returned after about forty minutes' absence,\r\nit was very evident that both the coffee and the tobacco had arrived,\r\nbecause the Galerie de Diane, large as it was, was full of smoke, and\r\nthree saucepans, filled with water, were standing on the fire, while two\r\nor three smaller ones were arranged on the almost priceless marble\r\nmantelpiece. Another batch of ravenous republicans had taken their seats\r\nat the board, their predecessors whiling the time away in sweet converse\r\nwith the \"ladies.\" Some of the latter were more usefully engaged; they\r\nwere rifling the cabinets of the most rare and valuable Sèvres, and\r\narranging the cups, saucers, platters on their tops to be ready for the\r\nbeverage that was being brewed. I was wondering how they had got at\r\nthese art treasures, having noticed an hour before that their\r\nreceptacles were locked and the keys taken away. The doors had simply\r\nbeen battered in with the hammer of the great clock of the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nIt was of a piece with the wanton destruction I had witnessed elsewhere,\r\nduring my absence from the Galerie de Diane. Before I returned thither,\r\nI had seen the portrait of General Bugeaud in the Salle des Maréchaux,\r\nliterally stabbed with bayonets; the throne treated to a similar fate,\r\nand carried off to the Place de la Bastille to be burned publicly; the\r\npapers of the royal family mercilessly flung to the winds; the dresses\r\nof the princesses torn to ribbons or else put on the backs of the vilest\r\nof the vile.\r\n\r\nThere was only one comic incident to relieve the horror of the whole. In\r\none of the private apartments the rabble had come upon an aged parrot\r\nscreeching at the top of its voice, \"À bas Guizot!\" The bird became a\r\nhero there and then, and was absolutely crammed with sweets and sugar.\r\nThat one comic note was not enough to dispel my disgust, and after the\r\nscene in the Galerie de Diane which I have just described, I made my way\r\ninto the street.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely proceeded a few steps, when I heard the not very\r\nstartling news that the republic had been formally proclaimed in the\r\nChamber by M. de Lamartine, who had afterwards repaired to the Hôtel de\r\nVille. At the same time, people were shouting that the King had died\r\nsuddenly. I endeavoured to get as far, but, though the distance was\r\ncertainly not more than half a mile, it took me more than an hour. At\r\nevery few yards my progress was interrupted by barricades, the\r\nself-elected custodians of which were particularly anxious to show their\r\nauthority to a man like myself, dressed in a coat. At last I managed to\r\nget to the corner of the Rues des Lombards and Saint-Martin, and just in\r\ntime to enjoy a sight than which I have witnessed nothing more comic\r\nduring the succeeding popular uprisings in subsequent years. I was just\r\ncrossing, when a procession hove in sight, composed mainly of ragged\r\nurchins, dishevelled women, and riff-raff of both sexes. In their midst\r\nwas an individual on horseback, dressed in the uniform of a general of\r\nthe First Republic, whom they were cheering loudly. The stationary crowd\r\nmade way for them, and mingled with the escort. The moment I had thrown\r\nin my lot with the latter, retreat was no longer possible, and in a very\r\nshort time I found myself in the courtyard of the Hôtel de Ville, and,\r\nin another minute or so, in the principal gallery on the first floor,\r\nwhere, it appears, _some members_ of the Provisional Government were\r\nalready at work. I had not the remotest notion who they were, nor did I\r\ncare to inquire, having merely come to look on. The work of the members\r\nof the Provisional Government seemed mainly to consist in consuming\r\nenormous quantities of charcuterie and washing them down with copious\r\nlibations of cheap wine. The place was positively reeking with the smell\r\nof both, not to mention the fumes of tobacco. Every one was smoking his\r\nhardest. The entrance of the individual in uniform caused somewhat of a\r\nsensation; a _member_--whom I had never seen before and whom I have\r\nnever beheld since--stepped forward to ask his business. The new-comer\r\ndid not appear to know himself; at any rate, he stammered and stuttered,\r\nbut his escort left him no time to betray his confusion more plainly.\r\n\"C'est le citoyen gouverneur de l'Hôtel de Ville,\" they shouted as with\r\none voice; and there and then the new governor was installed, though I\r\nam perfectly sure that not a soul of all those present knew as much as\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nSubsequent inquiries elicited the fact that the man was a fourth or\r\nfifth-rate singer, named Chateaurenaud, and engaged at the Opéra\r\nNational (formerly the Cirque Olympique) on the Boulevard du Temple. On\r\nthat day they were having a dress rehearsal of a new piece in which\r\nChateaurenaud was playing a military part. He had just donned his\r\ncostume when, hearing a noise on the Boulevards, he put his head out of\r\nthe window. The mob caught sight of him. \"A general, a general!\" cried\r\nseveral urchins; and in less time than it takes to tell, the theatre was\r\ninvaded, and notwithstanding his struggles, Chateaurenaud was carried\r\noff, placed on horseback, and conducted to the Hôtel de Ville, where,\r\nfor the next fortnight, he throned as governor. For, curious to relate,\r\nM. de Lamartine ratified his appointment(?) on the morning of the 25th\r\nof February. Chateaurenaud became an official of the secret police\r\nduring the Second Empire. I often saw him on horseback in the Bois de\r\nBoulogne, when the Emperor drove in that direction.\r\n\r\nI did not stay long in the Hôtel de Ville, but made my way back to the\r\nBoulevards as best I could; for by that time darkness had set in, and\r\nthe mob was shouting for illuminations, and obstructing the\r\nthoroughfares everywhere. Every now and then one came upon a body which\r\nhad been lying there since the morning, but they took no notice of it.\r\nTheir principal concern seemed the suitable acknowledgment of the advent\r\nof the Second Republic by the bourgeoisie by means of coloured devices,\r\nor, in default of such, by coloured lamps or even candles. Woe to the\r\nhouses, the inhabitants of which remained deaf to their summons to that\r\neffect. In a very few minutes every window was smashed to atoms, until\r\nat last a timid hand was seen to arrange a few bottles with candles\r\nstuck into them on the sill, and light them. Then they departed, to\r\nimpose their will elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThat night, after dinner, the first person of my acquaintance I met was\r\nMéry. He had been in the Chamber of Deputies from the very beginning of\r\nthe proceedings; it was he who solemnly assured me that the first cry of\r\n\"Vive la République!\" had been uttered by M. de Lamartine. I was\r\nsurprised at this, because I had been told that early in the morning the\r\npoet had paid a visit to the Duchesse d'Orléans to assure her of his\r\ndevotion to her cause. \"That may be so,\" said Méry, to whom I repeated\r\nwhat I had heard; \"but you must remember that Lamartine is always hard\r\nup, and closely pursued by duns. A revolution with the prospect of\r\nbecoming president of the republic was the only means of staving off his\r\ncreditors. He clutched at it as a last resource.\"\r\n\r\nAlexandre Dumas was there also, but I have an idea that he would have\r\nwillingly passed the sponge over that incident of his life, for I never\r\ncould get him to talk frankly on the subject. This does not mean that he\r\nwould have recanted his republican principles, but that he was ashamed\r\nat having lent his countenance to such a republic as that. I fancy there\r\nwere a great many like him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n     The Second Republic -- Lamartine's reason for proclaiming it --\r\n     Suspects Louis-Napoléon of similar motives for wishing to\r\n     overthrow it -- Tells him to go back to England -- De Persigny's\r\n     account of Louis-Napoléon's landing in France after February\r\n     24th, '48 -- Providential interference on behalf of\r\n     Louis-Napoléon -- Justification of Louis-Napoléon's belief in his\r\n     \"star\" -- My first meeting with him -- The origin of a celebrated\r\n     nickname -- Badinguet a creation of Gavarni -- Louis-Napoléon and\r\n     his surroundings at the Hôtel du Rhin -- His appearance and dress\r\n     -- Lord Normanby's opinion of his appearance -- Louis-Napoléon's\r\n     French -- A mot of Bismarck -- Cavaignac, Thiers, and Victor\r\n     Hugo's wrong estimate of his character -- Cavaignac and his\r\n     brother Godefroi -- The difference between Thiers and General\r\n     Cavaignac -- An elector's mot -- Some of the candidates for the\r\n     presidency of the Second Republic -- Electioneering expenses --\r\n     Impecuniosity of Louis-Napoléon -- A story in connection with it\r\n     -- The woman with the wooden legs -- The salons during the Second\r\n     Republic -- The theatres and their skits on the situation -- \"La\r\n     Propriété c'est le Vol\" -- France governed by the _National_ -- A\r\n     curious list of ministers and officials of the Second Republic --\r\n     Armand Marrast -- His plans for reviving business -- His\r\n     receptions at the Palais-Bourbon as President of the Chamber of\r\n     Deputies -- Some of the guests -- The Corps Diplomatique -- The\r\n     new deputies, their wives and daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew Louis-Napoléon, if not intimately, at least very well, for nearly\r\na quarter of a century, and I felt myself as little competent to give an\r\nopinion on him on the last as on the first day of our acquaintance. I\r\nfeel almost certain of one thing, though; that, if he had had very ample\r\nmeans of his own, the Second Empire would have never been. Since its\r\nfall I have heard and read a great deal about Louis-Napoléon's\r\nunfaltering belief in his star; I fancy it would have shone less\r\nbrightly to him but for the dark, impenetrable sky of impecuniosity in\r\nwhich it was set. Méry said that Lamartine proclaimed the Second\r\nRepublic as a means of staving off his creditors; and the accusation was\r\njustified by Lamartine's own words in the Assemblée Nationale itself on\r\nthe 11th of September, 1848: \"Je déclare hautement que le 24 Février à\r\nmidi, je ne pensais pas à la République.\" To use a popular locution, the\r\nauthor of \"L'Histoire des Girondins\" suspected, perhaps, that\r\nLouis-Napoléon might take a leaf from his, the author's, book; for the\r\nneedy man, though perhaps not a better psychologist than most men, has a\r\nvery comprehensive key to the motives of a great number of his\r\nfellow-creatures, especially if they be Frenchmen and professional\r\npoliticians. I am speaking by the light of many years' observation.\r\nFurthermore, the pecuniary embarrassments of Louis-Napoléon were no\r\nsecret to any one. \"I have established a republic for money's sake,\"\r\nLamartine said to himself; \"some one will endeavour to overthrow it for\r\nmoney's sake.\" I am aware that this is not a very elevated standard\r\nwhereby to judge political events; but I do not profess to be an\r\nhistorian--mine is only the little huckster shop of history.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that this was the reason why Lamartine told\r\nLouis-Napoléon to go back to England, in their interview--a secret\r\none--on the 2d of March, 1848.\r\n\r\nIt was M. de Persigny who told me this many years afterwards. \"The\r\nPrince could afford to humour De Lamartine in that way,\" he added, \"for\r\nif ever a man was justified in believing in his star it was he. I'll\r\ntell you a story which is scarcely known to half a dozen men, including\r\nthe Emperor and myself; I am not aware of its having been told by any\r\nbiographer. The moment we ascertained the truth of the news that reached\r\nus from Paris, we made for the coast, and, on Saturday morning, we\r\ncrossed in the mail-packet. It was very rough, and we had a good\r\nshaking, so that when we got to Boulogne we were absolutely 'done up.'\r\nBut we heard that a train was to start for Paris, and, as a matter of\r\ncourse, the Prince would not lose a minute. We had to walk to\r\nNeufchâtel, about three miles distant, because there was something the\r\nmatter with the rails, I do not know what. We flung ourselves into the\r\nfirst compartment, which already contained two travellers. Almost\r\nimmediately we had got under way, one of these, who had looked very\r\nstruck when we entered, addressed the Prince by name. He turned out to\r\nbe Monsieur Biesta, who had paid a visit to Napoléon during his\r\nimprisonment at Ham, and who immediately recognized him. Monsieur Biesta\r\nhad just left the Duc de Nemours. I do not know whether he was at that\r\ntime a Republican, a Monarchist, or an Imperialist, but he was a man of\r\nhonour, and it was thanks to him that the son of Louis-Philippe made his\r\nescape. The other one was the Marquis d'Arragon, who died about a\r\ntwelvemonth afterwards. All went well until we got to Amiens, where we\r\nhad to wait a very long while, the train which was to have taken us on\r\nto Paris having just left. For once in a way the Prince got impatient.\r\nHe who on the eve of the Coup d'État remained, at any rate outwardly,\r\nperfectly stolid, was fuming and fretting at the delay. One would have\r\nthought that the whole of Paris was waiting at the Northern station to\r\nreceive him with open arms, and to proclaim him Emperor there and then.\r\nBut impatient or not, we had to wait, and, what was worse or better, the\r\ntrain that finally took us came to a dead stop at Persan, where the news\r\nreached us that the rails had been broken up by the insurgents at\r\nPontoise, that a frightful accident had happened in consequence to the\r\ntrain we had missed by a few minutes at Amiens, in which at least thirty\r\nlives were lost, besides a great number of wounded. But for the merest\r\nchance we should have been among the passengers. Was I right in saying\r\nthat the Prince was justified in believing in his star?\"\r\n\r\nI did not meet with Louis-Napoléon until he was a candidate for the\r\npresidency of the Second Republic, and while he was staying at the Hôtel\r\ndu Rhin in the Place Vendôme. Of course, I had heard a great deal about\r\nhim, but my informants, to a man, were English. While the latter were\r\nalmost unanimous in predicting Louis-Napoléon's eventual advent to the\r\nthrone, the French, though in no way denying the influence of the\r\nNapoleonic legend, were apt to shrug their shoulders more or less\r\ncontemptuously at the pretensions of Hortense's son; for few ever\r\ndesignated him by any other name, until later on, when the nickname of\r\n\"Badinguet\" began to be on every one's lips. Consequently, I was anxious\r\nto catch a glimpse of him; but before noting the impressions produced by\r\nthat first meeting, I will devote a few lines to the origin of that\r\ncelebrated sobriquet.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I never heard it in connection with Louis-Napoléon until his\r\nbetrothal to Mdlle. Eugénie de Montijo became common \"talk;\" but I had\r\nheard and seen it in print a good many years before, and even as late as\r\n'48. There was, however, not the slightest attempt at that time to\r\ncouple it with the person of the future Emperor. Three solutions have\r\nmade the round of the papers at various times: (1) that it was the name\r\nof the stonemason or bricklayer who lent Louis-Napoléon his clothes to\r\nfacilitate his escape from Ham in June, 1845; (2) that it was the name\r\nof the soldier who was wounded by the Prince on the 5th of August,\r\n1840, at Boulogne, when the latter fired on Captain Col-Puygellier; (3)\r\nthat about the latter end of the forties a pipe-manufacturer introduced\r\na pipe, the head of which resembled that of Louis-Napoléon, and that the\r\npipemaker's name was Badinguet.\r\n\r\nThe latter solution may be dismissed at once as utterly without\r\nfoundation. With regard to that having reference to the stonemason, no\r\nstonemason lent Louis-Napoléon his clothes. The disguise was provided by\r\nDr. Conneau from a source which has never been revealed. There was,\r\nmoreover, no stonemason of the name of Badinguet at Ham, and, when\r\nLouis-Napoléon crossed the drawbridge of the castle, his face partially\r\nhidden by a board he was carrying on his shoulder, a workman, who\r\nmistook him for one of his mates, exclaimed, \"Hullo, there goes\r\nBertoux.\" Bertoux, not Badinguet.\r\n\r\nThe name of the soldier wounded by Louis-Napoléon was Geoffroy; he was a\r\ngrenadier, decorated on the battle-field; and shortly after Napoléon's\r\naccession to the throne, he granted him a pension. There can be no\r\npossible mistake about the name, seeing that it was attested at the\r\ntrial subsequent to the fiasco before the Court of Peers.\r\n\r\nThe real fact is this: Gavarni, like Balzac, invented many names,\r\nsuggested in many instances by those of their friends and acquaintances,\r\nor sometimes merely altered from those they had seen on signboards. The\r\ngreat caricaturist had a friend in the Département des Landes named\r\nBadingo; about '38 he began his sketches of students and their\r\ncompanions (\"Étudiants et Étudiantes\"), and in one of them a medical\r\nstudent shows his lady-love an articulated skeleton.\r\n\r\n\"Look at this,\" says the former; \"this is Eugénie, the former sweetheart\r\nof Badinguet--that tall, fair girl who was so fond of _meringues_. He\r\nhas had her mounted for thirty-six francs.\"\r\n\r\nThe connection is very obvious; it only wanted one single wag to\r\nremember the skit when Napoléon became engaged to Eugénie de Montijo. He\r\nset the ball rolling, and the rest followed as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Gavarni had not been half as original, as he imagined,\r\nin the invention of the name. Badinguet was a character in a one-act\r\nfarce entitled \"Le Mobilier de Rosine,\" played for the first time in\r\n1828, at the Théâtre Montansier; and there is a piece of an earlier date\r\neven, in which Grassot played a character by the name of Badinguet. In\r\n1848, there was a kind of Jules Vernesque piece at the Porte\r\nSaint-Martin, in which Badinguet, a Parisian shopkeeper, starts with his\r\nwife Euphémie for some distant island.\r\n\r\nTo return to Louis-Napoléon at the Hôtel du Rhin, and my first glimpse\r\nof him. I must own that I was disappointed with it. Though I had not the\r\nslightest ground for expecting to see a fine man, I did not expect to\r\nsee so utterly an insignificant one, and badly dressed in the bargain.\r\nOn the evening in question, he wore a brown coat of a peculiar colour, a\r\ngreen plush waistcoat, and a pair of yellowish trousers, the like of\r\nwhich I have never seen on the legs of any one off the stage. And yet\r\nLord Normanby, and a good many more who have said that he looked every\r\ninch a king, were not altogether wrong. There was a certain gracefulness\r\nabout him which owed absolutely nothing either to his tailor, his\r\nbarber, or his bootmaker. \"The gracefulness of awkwardness\" sounds\r\nremarkably like an Irish bull, yet I can find no other term to describe\r\nhis gait and carriage. Louis-Napoléon's legs seemed to have been an\r\nafterthought of his Creator--they were too short for his body, and his\r\nhead appeared constantly bent down, to supervise their motion;\r\nconsequently, their owner was always at a disadvantage when compelled to\r\nmake use of them. But when standing still, or on horseback, there was an\r\nindescribable something about the man which at once commanded attention.\r\nI am not overlooking the fact that, on the occasion of our first\r\nmeeting, my curiosity had been aroused; but I doubt whether any one,\r\nendowed with the smallest power of observation, though utterly ignorant\r\nwith regard to his previous history, and equally sceptical with regard\r\nto his future destiny, could have been in his company for any length of\r\ntime without being struck with his appearance.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the apartment on the evening in question, Louis-Napoléon\r\nwas leaning in his favourite attitude against the mantelpiece, smoking\r\nthe scarcely ever absent cigarette, and pulling at the heavy brown\r\nmoustache, the ends of which in those days were not waxed into points as\r\nthey were later on. There was not the remotest likeness to any portrait\r\nof the Bonaparte family I had ever seen. He wore his thin, lank hair\r\nmuch longer than he did afterwards. The most startling features were\r\ndecidedly the aquiline nose and the eyes; the latter, of a\r\ngreyish-blue, were comparatively small and somewhat almond-shaped, but,\r\nexcept at rare intervals, there was an impenetrable look, which made it\r\nexceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to read their owner's thoughts\r\nby them. If they were \"the windows of his soul,\" their blinds were\r\nconstantly down. The \"I am pleased to see you, sir,\" with which he\r\nwelcomed me, holding out his hand at the same time, was the English of\r\nan educated German who had taken great pains to get the right accent and\r\npronunciation, without, however, completely succeeding; and when I heard\r\nhim speak French, I detected at once his constant struggle with the same\r\ndifficulties. The struggle lasted till the very end of his life, though,\r\nby dint of speaking very slowly, he overcame them to a marvellous\r\nextent. But the moment he became in any way excited, the _f_'s and the\r\n_t_'s and the _p_'s were always trying to oust the _v_'s, the _d_'s and\r\nthe _b_'s from their newly-acquired positions, and often gained a\r\nmomentary victory. There is an amusing story to that effect, in\r\nconnection with Napoléon's first interview with Bismarck. I will not\r\nvouch for its truth, but, on the face of it, it sounds blunt enough to\r\nbe genuine. The Emperor was complimenting the German statesman on his\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Bismarck, I have never heard a German speak French as you do,\"\r\nsaid Napoléon.\r\n\r\n\"Will you allow me to return the compliment, sire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never heard a Frenchman speak French as you do.\"[47]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 47: In the documents relating to the affair at\r\n         Strasburg, there is the report to Louis-Philippe by an officer\r\n         in the 46th regiment of the line, named Pleigné, in which the\r\n         latter, borrowing the process of Balzac as applied to the\r\n         French of the Baron de Nucingen, credits Louis-Napoléon with\r\n         the following phrase: \"_Fous êtes tecoré de Chuillet; fous\r\n         tefez être un prafe, che vous técore._\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Louis-Napoléon held out his hand and I looked into his face,\r\nI felt almost tempted to put him down as an opium-eater. Ten minutes\r\nafterwards, I felt convinced that, to use a metaphor, he himself was the\r\ndrug, and that every one with whom he came in contact was bound to yield\r\nto its influence. When I came away that evening, I could have given\r\nCavaignac, Thiers, Lamartine, Hugo, and the rest, who wanted to make a\r\ncat's-paw of him, a timely warning, if they would have condescended to\r\nlisten to, and profit by it, which I am certain they would not have\r\ndone. Strange as it may seem, every one of these men, and, with the\r\nexception of one, all undoubtedly clever, thought Louis-Napoléon either\r\nan imbecile or a secret drunkard. And, what is more, they endeavoured to\r\npropagate their opinion throughout the length and breadth, not only of\r\nFrance, but of Europe.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the one who was really the greatest nonentity among the latter\r\nwas most lavish in his contempt. I am alluding to General Cavaignac. The\r\nnobodies who have governed or misgoverned France since the Fall of Sedan\r\nwere, from an intellectual point of view, eagles compared to that surly\r\nand bumptious drill-sergeant, who had nothing, absolutely nothing, to\r\nrecommend him for the elevated position he coveted. He was the least\r\namong all those brilliant African soldiers whose names and prowess were\r\non every one's lips; he had really been made a hero of, at so much per\r\nline, by the staff of the _National_, where his brother Godefroy wielded\r\nunlimited power. He was all buckram; and, in the very heart of Paris,\r\nand in the midst of that republic whose fiercest watchword, whose\r\nloudest cry, was \"equality,\" he treated partisans and opponents alike,\r\nas he would have treated a batch of refractory Arabs in a distant\r\nprovince of that newly-conquered African soil. He disliked every one who\r\ndid not wear a uniform, and assumed a critical attitude towards every\r\none who did. His republicanism was probably as sincere as that of\r\nThiers--it meant \"La République c'est moi:\" with this difference, that\r\nThiers was amiable, witty, and charming, though treacherous, and that\r\nCavaignac was the very reverse. His honesty was beyond suspicion; that\r\nis, he felt convinced that he was the only possible saviour of France:\r\nbut it was impaired by his equally sincere conviction that bribery and\r\ncoercion--of cajoling he would have none--were admissible, nay,\r\nincumbent to attain that end. \"Thiers, c'est la république en écureuil,\r\nCavaignac c'est la république en ours mal léché,\" said a witty\r\njournalist. He and Louis-Napoléon were virtually the two men who were\r\ncontending for the presidential chair, and the chances of Cavaignac may\r\nbe judged by the conclusion of the verbal report of one of Lamoricière's\r\nemissaries, who canvassed one of the departments.\r\n\r\n\"'The thing might be feasible,' said an elector, 'if your general's name\r\nwas Geneviève de Brabant, or that of one of the four sons of Aymon.[48]\r\nBut his name is simply Cavaignac--Cavaignac, and that's all. I prefer\r\nNapoléon; at any rate, there is a ring about that name.' And I am afraid\r\nthat eleven-twelfths of the electors are of the same opinion.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 48: The four knights of a Carlovingian legend, who\r\n         were mounted on one horse named Bayard.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nAs for Ledru Rollin, Raspail, Changarnier, and even Lamartine and the\r\nPrince de Joinville, some of whom were candidates against their will,\r\nthey were out of the running from the very start, though, curiously\r\nenough, the son of the monarch whom the republic had driven from the\r\nthrone obtained more votes than the man who had proclaimed that\r\nrepublic. These votes were altogether discarded as unconstitutional,\r\nthough one really fails to see why one member of a preceding dynasty\r\nshould have been held to be more eligible than another. Be this as it\r\nmay, the votes polled by the sailor prince amounted to over twenty-three\r\nthousand, showing that he enjoyed a certain measure of popularity. It is\r\ndoubtful whether the Duc d'Aumale or the Duc de Nemours would have\r\nobtained a fifth of that number. As I have already said, the latter was\r\ndisliked by his father's opponents for his suspected legitimist\r\ntendencies, and tacitly blamed by some of the partisans of the Orleanist\r\nrégime for his lack of resistance on the 24th of February; the former's\r\nsubmission \"to the will of the nation,\" as embodied in a manifesto \"to\r\nthe inhabitants of Algeria,\" provoked no enthusiasm either among friends\r\nor foes.[49] Perhaps public rumour was not altogether wrong, when it\r\naverred that the D'Orléans were too tight-fisted to spend their money in\r\nelectioneering literature. The expense involved in that item was a\r\nterrible obstacle to Louis-Napoléon and his few faithful henchmen; for,\r\nthough the Napoleonic idea was pervading all classes of society, there\r\nwas, correctly speaking, no Bonapartist party to shape it for the\r\npractical purposes of the moment. The Napoleonic idea was a fond\r\nremembrance of France's glorious past, rather than a hope of its renewal\r\nin the future. Even the greatest number of the most ardent worshippers\r\nof that marvellous soldier of fortune, doubted whether his nephew was\r\nsufficiently popular to obtain an appreciable following, and those who\r\ndid not doubt were mostly poor. While Dufaure and Lamoricière were\r\nscattering money broadcast, and using pressure of the most arbitrary\r\nkind, in order to insure Cavaignac's success, Louis-Napoléon and his\r\nknot of partisans were absolutely reduced to their own personal\r\nresources. Miss Howard--afterwards Comtesse de Beauregard--and Princesse\r\nMathilde had given all they could; a small loan was obtained from M.\r\nFould; and some comparatively scanty supplies had been forthcoming from\r\nEngland--it was said at the time, with how much truth I know not, that\r\nLords Palmerston and Malmesbury had contributed: but the exchequer was\r\nvirtually empty. A stray remittance of a few thousand francs, from an\r\naltogether unexpected quarter, and most frequently from an anonymous\r\nsender, arrived now and then; but it was what the Germans call \"a drop\r\nof water in a very hot frying-pan;\" it barely sufficed to stop a hole.\r\nMoney was imperatively wanted for the printing of millions upon millions\r\nof handbills, thousands and thousands of posters, and their\r\ndistribution; for the expenses of canvassers, electioneering agents, and\r\nso forth. The money went to the latter, the rest was obtained on credit.\r\nPrince Louis, confident of success, emptied his pockets of the last\r\nfive-franc pieces; when he had no more, he promised to pay. He was as\r\nbadly off as his famous uncle before the turn of fortune came.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 49: During the sacking of the Tuileries, the mob\r\n         ruthlessly destroyed the busts and pictures of every living son\r\n         of Louis-Philippe, with the exception of those of the Prince de\r\n         Joinville.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with this dire impecuniosity, I remember a story for the\r\ntruth of which I can vouch as if I had had it from Louis-Napoléon's own\r\nlips. In front of Siraudin's confectioner's shop at the angle of the\r\nBoulevard des Capucines and the Rue de la Paix, there sits an old woman\r\nwith two wooden legs. About '48, when she was very pretty and dressed\r\nwith a certain coquettishness, she was already there, though sitting a\r\nlittle higher up, in front of the wall of the Ministry for Foreign\r\nAffairs, which has since made room for the handsome establishment of\r\nGiroux. Behind her, on the wall, were suspended for sale some cheap and\r\nnot very artistically executed reproductions of Fragonard, \"Le Coucher\r\nde la Mariée,\" etc., all of which would fetch high prices now; also\r\nsongs, the tunes of which she played with great taste on her violin. It\r\nwas reported that she had been killed during the attack on the ministry,\r\nbut to people's great surprise she reappeared a few days afterwards.\r\nPrince Louis, who was staying at the Place Vendôme, then used to take a\r\nshort cut by the Rue Neuve des Capucines to the Boulevards, and it seems\r\nthat he never passed her without giving her something. In a few weeks\r\nshe came to look upon his contributions as a certain part of her income.\r\nShe knew who he was, and, curiously enough, seemed to be aware not only\r\nof his political preoccupations, but of his pecuniary embarrassments. I\r\nam unable to say whether she was in sympathy with the former, but she\r\nwas evidently concerned about the latter; for, one evening, after\r\nthanking Louis-Napoléon, she added, \"Monseigneur, je voudrais vous dire\r\nun mot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Parlez, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"On me dit que vous êtes fort gêné dans ce moment. J'ai trois billets de\r\nmille francs chez moi, qui ne font rien. Voulez-vous me permettre de\r\nvous les offrir; vous me les rendrez quand vous serez empereur.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Louis did not accept them, but he never forgot a kindness, and\r\nwhen he did become Emperor, he offered her a small annuity. The answer\r\nwas characteristic of her independence. \"Dites à l'empereur qu'il est\r\nbien bon de se rappeler de moi, mais je ne puis pas accepter son offre.\r\nS'il avait accepté mon argent, je ne dis pas, maintenant, non.\" And\r\nwhile I am writing these notes, she still sits in her usual place,\r\nthough I have heard it said more than once that she is the owner of one\r\nor two houses in the Avenue de l'Opéra, and that she gave a considerable\r\nmarriage portion to her daughter, who has remained ignorant of the\r\nsources of her mother's income, who was educated in the country, and has\r\nnever been to Paris. One of the conditions of her marriage was that she\r\nshould emigrate to Australia. For the latter part of the story, I will,\r\nhowever, not vouch.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of October and November, '48, I saw Prince Louis at\r\nleast a dozen times, though only once away from his own apartments.\r\nThere was really \"nowhere to go,\" for most of the salons had closed\r\ntheir doors, and those which remained open were invaded by political\r\npartisans of all shades. Conversation, except on one topic, there was\r\nlittle or none. Social entertainments were scarcely to be thought of\r\nafter the bloody disorders in June: Paris trade suffered in consequence,\r\nand the whole of the shopkeeping element, which virtually constituted\r\nthe greater part of the Garde Nationale, regretted the fall of the\r\nOrléans dynasty to which it had so materially contributed. After these\r\ndisorders in June, the troops bivouacked for a whole month on the\r\nBoulevards; on the Boulevard du Temple with its seven theatres; on the\r\nBoulevard Poissonnière, almost in front of the Gymnase; on the\r\nBoulevard Montmartre, in front of the Variétés; on the Place de la\r\nBourse, in front of the Vaudeville. The new masters did not care to be\r\nheld up to ridicule; they insinuated, rather than asserted, that the\r\ninsults levelled from the stage had contributed to the insurrection; and\r\nseeing that the bourgeoisie, very contrite already, did not care to hear\r\n\"the praise of the saviours of the country\" by command, they deserted\r\nthe play-houses and kept their money in their pockets. The Constituent\r\nAssembly was compelled to grant the managers an indemnity; but, as it\r\ncould not keep the soldiers there for ever, and as it cared still less\r\nto vote funds to its enemies while its supporters were clamouring for\r\nevery cent of it, the strict supervision gradually relaxed. The first to\r\ntake advantage of this altered state of things was Clairville, with his\r\n\"La Propriété c'est le Vol\" (November 28, '48), a skit on the celebrated\r\nphrase of Proudhon. It is very doubtful whether the latter had uttered\r\nit in the sense with which the playwright invested it; but fear is\r\nproverbially illogical, and every one in Paris ran to see the piece,\r\ntrusting probably that it might produce a salutary effect on those who\r\nintended to take the philosopher's axiom literally.\r\n\r\n\"La Propriété c'est le Vol\" was described on the bills as \"a socialistic\r\nextravaganza in three acts and seven tableaux.\" The scene of the first\r\ntableau represents the garden of Eden. The Serpent, who is the Evil\r\nSpirit, declares war at once upon Adam, who embodies the principle of\r\nProperty. The Serpent was a deliberate caricature of Proudhon with his\r\nlarge spectacles.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent tableaux, Adam, by a kind of metempsychosis, had been\r\nchanged into Bonichon, an owner of house property in the Paris of the\r\nnineteenth century. The Serpent, though still wearing his spectacles,\r\nhad been equally transformed into a modern opponent of all property. We\r\nare in February, '48. Bonichon and some of his fellow-bourgeois are\r\nfeasting in honor of the proposed measures of reform, when they are\r\nscared out of their wits by the appearance of the Serpent, who informs\r\nthem that the Republic has sidled up to Reform, managed to hide itself\r\nbeneath its cloak, and been proclaimed. The next scene brings us to the\r\nyear 1852 (four years in advance of the period), when the right of every\r\none to live by the toil of his hands has become law. Bonichon is being\r\nharassed and persecuted by a crowd of handicraftsmen and others, who\r\ninsist on working for him whether he likes it or not. The glazier\r\nsmashes his windows, in order to compel him to have new panes put in.\r\nThe paper-hanger tears the paper off his walls on the same principle.\r\nThe hackney coachman flings Bonichon into his cab, takes him for a four\r\nhours' drive, and charges accordingly. A dentist imitates the tactics of\r\nPeter the Great with his courtiers, forces him into a chair and operates\r\nupon his grinders, though, unlike Peter, he claims the full fee. A dozen\r\nor so of modistes and dressmakers invade his apartments with double the\r\nnumber of gowns for Madame Eve Bonichon, who, the reverse of her\r\nhusband, does not object to this violent appeal for her custom. Perhaps\r\nMadame Octave, a charming woman who played the part, did well to submit,\r\nbecause during the first tableau, the audience, though by no means\r\nsqueamish, had come to the conclusion that Madame Eve would be all the\r\nbetter for a little more clothing.\r\n\r\nAnd so the piece goes on. The first performance took place twelve days\r\nbefore the presidential election, when Cavaignac was still at the head\r\nof affairs. Notwithstanding his energetic suppression of the disorders\r\nin June, every one, with the exception of the journalistic swashbucklers\r\nof _Le National_, hoped to get rid of him; and a song aimed at him\r\ncruelly dissected his utter insignificance from a mental, moral, and\r\npolitical point of view. When Louis-Napoléon gained the day, the song\r\nwas changed for a more kindly one.\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that during those days France was\r\nabsolutely governed by the _National_. I made a list, by no means\r\ncomplete, at the time, of the various appointments and high places that\r\nhad fallen to the members of the staff and those connected with it\r\nfinancially and otherwise. I have kept it, and transcribe it here with\r\nscarcely any comment.\r\n\r\nArmand Marrast, the editor, became a member of the Provisional\r\nGovernment, Mayor of Paris, and subsequently President of the National\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nMarrast (No. 2) became Procureur-Général at Pau.\r\n\r\nMarrast (No. 3), who had been a captain of light horse during the reign\r\nof Louis-Philippe, was given a colonelcy unattached.\r\n\r\nMarrast (No. 4) became Vice-Principal of the Lycée Corneille.\r\n\r\nBastide, one of the staff, became Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nVaulabelle, one of the staff, became Minister of Public Education.\r\n\r\nGoudchaux, the banker of the _National_, became Minister of Finances.\r\n\r\nRecurt, the chief physician to the staff, became Minister of the\r\nInterior and subsequently Minister of Public Works (President of the\r\nBoard of Works).\r\n\r\nTrélat, another physician, became Minister of Public Works.\r\n\r\nMarie, the solicitor to the _National_, became a member of the\r\nProvisional Government, a member of the Executive Committee, and\r\nsubsequently Minister of Justice.\r\n\r\nGénin, one of the staff, became chief of the literary department at the\r\nMinistry of Public Education.\r\n\r\nCharras, one of the staff, became Under-Secretary of State, at the\r\nMinistry for War.\r\n\r\nDegouve-Denuncques, one of the staff, became Prefect of the Département\r\nof the Somme.\r\n\r\nBuchez, third physician and an occasional contributor, became Deputy\r\nMayor of Paris and subsequently President of the Assembly up to the 15th\r\nof May (when he had to make room for M. Armand Marrast himself). As will\r\nbe seen, within a month of the republicans' advent to power, M. Buchez\r\nhad been raised to one of the highest functions in the State, though\r\nabsolutely devoid of any political or parliamentary talent, as was shown\r\nlater on by his \"Histoire Parlementaire de la Révolution Française,\" an\r\nutterly commonplace production.\r\n\r\nDussart, one of the staff, became Prefect of the Seine-Inférieure.\r\n\r\nAdam, one of the staff, became Chief Secretary of the Prefecture of the\r\nSeine.\r\n\r\nSain de Bois-le Comte, one of the staff, became minister plenipotentiary\r\nat Turin.\r\n\r\nFélicien Mallefille, one of the staff, became minister plenipotentiary\r\nat Lisbon.\r\n\r\nAnselme Petétin, one of the staff, became minister plenipotentiary at\r\nHanover.\r\n\r\nAuguste Petétin (his brother), one of the staff, became Prefect of the\r\nDepartment of the Côte-d'Or.\r\n\r\nFrédéric Lacroix, one of the staff, became chief secretary for civil\r\naffairs in Algeria.\r\n\r\nHetzel, one of the staff, became chief secretary to the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs.\r\n\r\nRousset, one of the staff, became Prefect of the Department of the\r\nLoire.\r\n\r\nDuclerc, shorthand reporter, became for a little while Minister of\r\nFinances.\r\n\r\nPagnerre, publisher of the _National_, and bookseller, became a mayor, a\r\nmember of the Provisional Government, a member of the Executive\r\nCommittee, and finally Director of the Comptoir d'Escompte.\r\n\r\nAchille Grégoire, the printer of the _National_, became Prefect of the\r\nDepartment of the Upper-Saône.\r\n\r\nClément Thomas, called the Constable of the _National_, became the\r\nCommander-in-chief of the National Guard of the Seine.\r\n\r\nThere are a few score more, friends and allies, such as Lalanne, who was\r\nmade director of the national workshops; Levrault, who was sent to\r\nNaples as minister plenipotentiary; Carette, who became Civil-Chief at\r\nConstantine; Carteron, who was appointed keeper of the national\r\narchives, etc.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, all these adventurers had revolving around them a\r\nnumber of satellites, as eager as the former to reap the fruits of the\r\nsituation. Most of them, like the cat of Heine's epigram, had to devour\r\ntheir steak raw; they did not know how to cook it. Ministers, prefects,\r\nand high dignitaries of State as they were, they felt awkward in the\r\nsociety of those to whom no illusion was possible with regard to their\r\norigin and that of their political fortunes.\r\n\r\nThey haunted, therefore, by preference, the less well frequented\r\nrestaurants and cafés, the wings of the minor theatres, on the pretext\r\nthat they were the elect of the people, and that the people were their\r\nfittest companions. Their erstwhile leader and chief scorned to stoop to\r\nsuch tricks. He was an educated man, with a thick veneer of the\r\ngentleman about him, which, however, did not prevent him from being one\r\nof the two most arrant snobs I have met anywhere. I advisedly say\r\nanywhere, for France herself does not produce that objectionable genus\r\nto any appreciable extent. You may find a good many cads, you will find\r\ncomparatively few snobs. Compared to Armand Marrast, Eugène Sue was\r\nnowhere as a snob. He was a thickset man with a rubicund face, with a\r\nmass of grey woolly hair and a kind of stubbly, small moustache. His\r\nmanners were supposed to be modelled on those of the nobles of the old\r\nrégime; said manners mainly consisting of swaggering impudence to those\r\nwhom he considered his equals, and freezing insolence to those he deemed\r\nhis inferiors. The latter, I need not say, were by far the most\r\nnumerous. He who bellowed most loudly that birth should carry no\r\nprivilege, never forgot to remind his hearers, by deeds, if not by\r\nwords, that he was of noble descent. \"Si sa famille était noble, sa mère\r\ns'est surement endormie dans l'antichambre un jour qu'un\r\nvalet-de-chambre entreprenant était trop près,\" said the Marquis\r\nd'Arragon one evening.[50] He felt greatly flattered at the\r\ncaricaturists of the day representing him in the court dress of Louis\r\nXVI.'s reign, though to most people he looked like a \"marquis de quatre\r\nsous.\"[51]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 50: The remark was not original. The Marquise\r\n         d'Espreménil said it of herself when she saw her son join the\r\n         Revolution of '89.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 51: The peripatetic vendors of songs, dressed as\r\n         nobles, who up till '60 were frequently singing their\r\n         compositions in the street.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nHe professed to be very fond of antique furniture and decorations, and\r\nthis fondness was the main cause of his ousting his former subaltern,\r\nBuchez, from the presidential chair of the Assembly, for, shortly before\r\nthe revolution of '48, the official residence of that functionary had\r\nbeen put in thorough repair, its magnificent furniture had been\r\nrestored, etc.\r\n\r\nThe depression of business inspired M. Armand Marrast with the happy\r\nthought of giving some entertainments in the hope of reviving it. During\r\nthe Third Republic, though I had ceased to live in France permanently, I\r\nhave seen a good many motley gatherings at the Élysée-Bourbon, and at\r\nthe Hôtel-de-Ville, especially in M. Grévy's time, though Mac-Mahon's\r\npresidency offered some diverting specimens also; but I have never seen\r\nanything like the social functions at the Palais-Bourbon during the\r\nmonths of September, October, and November, 1848. They were absolutely\r\nthe festive scenes of Paul de Kock on a large scale, amidst Louis XIV.\r\nand Louis XV. furniture, instead of the bourgeois mahogany, and with an\r\nexquisitely artistic background, instead of the commonplace\r\npaperhangings of the lower middle-class dwellings. The corps\r\ndiplomatique was virtually on the horns of a dilemma. After the\r\nFebruary revolution, the shock of which was felt throughout the whole of\r\nEurope, and caused most of the sovereigns to shake on their thrones, it\r\nhad stood by M. de Lamartine, and even by his successor at the French\r\nForeign Office, M. Bastide, if not with enthusiasm, at least with a kind\r\nof complacency. The republic proclaimed by the former, might, after all,\r\ncontain elements of vitality. The terrible disorders in June tended to\r\nshake this reluctant confidence; still, there was but little change in\r\nthe ambassadors' outward attitude, until it became too evident that,\r\nunless a strong dictator should intervene, mob rule was dangerously\r\nnigh. Then the corps diplomatique began to hold aloof. Of course there\r\nwere exceptions, such as, for instance, Mr. Richard Rush, the minister\r\nof the United States, who had been the first to congratulate the\r\nProvisional Government, and the various representatives of the\r\nSouth-American republics; but even the latter could scarcely refrain\r\nfrom expressing their astonishment at the strange company in which they\r\nfound themselves. The women were perhaps the most remarkable, as women\r\ngenerally are when out of their element. The greater part had probably\r\nnever been in a drawing-room before, and, notwithstanding M. Taine's\r\nsubsequently expressed dictum about the facility with which a Parisien\r\ngrisette, shopwoman, or lady's-maid may be transformed at a few moments\r\ninto a semblance of a _grande dame_, these very petites bourgeoises and\r\ntheir demoiselles made a very indifferent show. Perhaps the grisette,\r\nshopwoman, or lady's-maid would have acquitted herself better. Her\r\nnatural taste, sharpened by constant contact with her social superiors,\r\nmight have made up for the slender resources of her wardrobe; and, as\r\nthe French say, \"one forgives much in the way of solecism to the\r\nprettily dressed woman.\" As it was, the female section of M. Marrast's\r\nguests could advance no valid plea for mercy on that score. The\r\ndaughters looked limp with their choregraphic exertions: the emblem of\r\ninnocence, \"la sainte mousseline,\" as Ambroise Thomas called it\r\nafterwards, hung in vague, undefined folds on angular figures, perhaps\r\nbecause the starch necessary to it had been appropriated by the matrons.\r\nThe latter were rigid to a degree, and looked daggers at their spouses\r\nand their friends at the slightest attempt to stir them to animation.\r\n\"Fais donc danser ma vieille,\" was the consecrated formula with which a\r\nnot very eager cavalier was dragged to the seat where said \"vieille\"\r\nwas reposing in all the majesty of her unaccustomed finery, considerably\r\nimpaired in the wearer's transit on foot from her domicile at Montrouge\r\nor Ménilmontant to the banks of the Seine; for the weather that year was\r\nalmost tropical, even in the autumn, and consequently the cab had been\r\ndispensed with. It would appear, from a remark I overheard, that Jehu,\r\nin the way of business, preferred as fares the partisans of and\r\nadherents to the fallen régimes, even of the latest one. Said a portly\r\ndame to her neighbour, alluding to the cabman, \"Il a absolument refusé\r\nde nous prendre. Il a dit qu'il était dans l'opposition, et qu'il ne\r\nvoulait pas trahir ses principes à moins de dix francs. Dix francs, ma\r\nchère, nous aurions pu souper chez nous, et sans compter les frais de\r\ntoilette et de blanchissage. Quant à l'honneur d'être ici, ça ne compte\r\npas pour grand'chose, vu que tout le quartier y est; nous demeurons à\r\nBatignolles, et il a fallu descendre en ville ce matin pour avoir une\r\npaire de gants blancs. Chez nous, partout la même réponse: 'Des gants\r\nblancs, madame, nous n'en avons plus. Presque toutes les dames du\r\nquartier vont au Palais-Bourbon ce soir, et depuis hier il nous reste\r\nque des petites pointures (sizes), des sept et des sept et demies.'\"\r\n\r\nAs for the \"élu du peuple souverain,\" when he had failed to draw his\r\n\"vieille\" into the mazy dance, and been snubbed for his pains in the\r\nbargain, he returned to his fellow-deputies, many of whom might be\r\neasily recognized by the golden-fringed tricolour rosette in their\r\nbuttonholes, though some had merely kept it in their pockets. The \"élu\r\ndu peuple\" did not dance himself. Perhaps the most curious group was\r\nthat of the young attachés and clerks of the Foreign Office who had come\r\nto enjoy themselves, who, even at that time, were nearly all of good\r\nbirth, and who, to use a colloquial expression, looked not unlike brass\r\nknockers on a pigsty. This was the society Louis-Napoléon was to sweep\r\naway with the aid of men, some of whom I have endeavoured to sketch in\r\nsubsequent notes. I would fain say a few words of a \"shipwrecked one,\"\r\nof the preceding dynasty, whose acquaintance I did not make until the\r\nvessel he had steered so long had foundered, and of the self-constituted\r\npilot of the interim régime. I am alluding to MM. Guizot and de\r\nLamartine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n     Guizot, Lamartine, and Béranger -- Public opinion at sea with\r\n     regard to the real Guizot -- People fail to see the real man\r\n     behind the politician -- Guizot regrets this false conception --\r\n     \"I have not the courage to be unpopular\" -- A tilt at Thiers --\r\n     My first meeting with him -- A picture and the story connected\r\n     with it -- M.

Judith Frère.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat sentence of Louis-Philippe to Lord ----, quoted elsewhere: \"Guizot\r\nis so terribly respectable; I am afraid there is a mistake either about\r\nhis nationality or his respectability, for they are badly matched,\"\r\nreflected the opinion of the majority of Frenchmen with regard to the\r\neminent statesman. The historian who was supposed to know Cromwell and\r\nWashington as well as if he had lived with them, was credited at last\r\nwith being a stern rigid Puritan in private life like the first,\r\nimpatient of contradiction like the second--in short, a kind of walking\r\ncopy-book moral, who never unbent, whose slightest actions were intended\r\nby him to convey a lesson to the rest of mankind. Unable to devote much\r\ntime to her during the week, Guizot was in the habit of taking his\r\nmother for a stroll in the Park of St. Cloud on Sundays. The French, who\r\nare never tired of shouting, \"Oh, ma mère! oh, ma mère!\" resented such\r\nsmall attentions on the part of the son, because, they maintained, they\r\nwere meant as exhibitions. Even such a philosopher as Ernest Renan\r\nfailed to see that there were two dissimilar men in Guizot, the Guizot\r\nof public life and the Guizot of home life; that, behind the imperious,\r\nhaughty, battlesome orator of the Chamber, with his almost marble mask,\r\nthere was a tender and loving heart, capable of the most deep-seated\r\ndevotion; that the cares of State once thrown off, the supercilious\r\nstare melted like ice beneath the sun of spring into a prepossessing\r\nsmile, captivating every one with whom he came in contact.\r\n\r\nGuizot regretted this erroneous conception the world had formed of his\r\ncharacter. \"But what can I do?\" he asked. \"In reality, I haven't the\r\ncourage to be unpopular any more than other people; but neither have I\r\nthe courage to prance about in my own drawing-room as if I were on\r\nwires\"--this was a slight slap at M. Thiers,--\"nor can I write on\r\nsubjects with which I have no sympathy\"--that was a second,--\"and I\r\nshould cut but a sorry figure on horseback\"--that was a\r\nthird;--\"consequently people who, I am sure, wish me well, but who will\r\nnot come and see me at home, hold me up as a misanthrope, while I know\r\nthat I am nothing of the kind.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he took from his table an article by M. Renan on the first\r\nvolume of his \"Mémoires,\" an article couched in the most flattering\r\nterms, but giving the most conventional portrait of the author himself.\r\n\"Why doesn't he come and see me? He would soon find that I am not the\r\nsolitary, tragic, buckram figure that has already become legendary, and\r\nwhich, like most legendary figures, is absolutely false.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation--or rather monologue, for I was careful not to\r\ninterrupt him--took place in the early part of the Second Empire, in the\r\nhouse in the Rue de la Ville-Levêque he occupied for five and twenty\r\nyears, and until 1860. The Coup d'État had irretrievably shattered\r\nGuizot's political career. It had destroyed whatever hopes may have\r\nremained after the flight of Louis-Philippe. Consequently Guizot's\r\nproper place is among the men of that reign; the reason why I insert him\r\nhere is because my acquaintance with him only began after his\r\ndisappearance from public life.\r\n\r\nIt occurred in this way. One evening, after dinner at M. de Morny's, we\r\nwere talking about pictures, and especially about those of the Spanish\r\nschool, when our host turned to me. \"Have you ever seen 'the Virgin'\r\nbelonging to M. Guizot?\" he asked. I told him I had not. \"Then go and\r\nsee it,\" he said. \"It is one of the finest specimens of its kind I ever\r\nsaw, I might say the finest.\" Next day I asked permission of M. Guizot\r\nto come and see it, and, almost by return of post, I received an\r\ninvitation for the following Thursday night to one of his \"at homes.\"\r\n\r\nUntil then I had never met M. Guizot, except at one of his ministerial\r\nsoirées under the preceding dynasty. The apartment offered nothing very\r\nstriking: the furniture was of the ordinary kind to be found in almost\r\nevery bourgeois drawing-room, with this difference--that it was\r\nconsiderably shabbier; for Guizot was poor all his life. The man who had\r\nsaid to the nation, \"Enrichissez vous, enrichissez vous,\" had never\r\nacted upon the advice himself. I know for a fact that, while he was in\r\npower, he was asked to appoint to the post of receiver-general of the\r\nGironde one of the richest financiers in France, who had expressed the\r\nintention to share the magnificent benefits of the appointment with him.\r\nM. Guizot simply and steadfastly refused to do anything of the kind.\r\n\r\nOn the evening in question, a lamp with a reflector was placed in front\r\nof the picture I had come to see, probably in my honour. M. de Morny had\r\nnot exaggerated the beauty of it, but it bore no signature, and M.\r\nGuizot himself had no idea with regard to the painter. \"There is a\r\ncurious story connected with it,\" he said, \"but I cannot tell it you\r\nnow; come and see me one morning and I will. As an Englishman it will\r\ninterest you; especially if you will take the trouble to read between\r\nthe lines. I will tell you a few more, perhaps, but the one connected\r\nwith the picture is 'la bonne bouche.'\"\r\n\r\nThe company at M. Guizot's, on that and other occasions, mainly\r\nconsisted of those who had been vanquished in the recent struggle with\r\nLouis-Napoléon, or thought they had been; for a great many were mere\r\nword-spinners, who had been quite as vehement in their denunciations of\r\nthe man they were now surrounding when he was in power, as they were in\r\ntheir diatribes against the man who, after all, saved France for\r\neighteen years from anarchy, and did not indulge more freely in\r\nnepotism, peculation, and kindred amenities than those who came after\r\nhim. But, at the outset of these notes, I took the resolution to eschew\r\npolitics, and I will endeavour to keep it as far as possible.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, I soon availed myself of M. Guizot's permission\r\nto call upon him in the morning, and it was then that he told me the\r\nfollowing story connected with the picture.\r\n\r\n\"After the Spanish marriages, Queen Isabella wished to convey to me a\r\nsignal mark of her gratitude--for what, Heaven alone knows, because it\r\nis the only political transaction I would willingly efface from my\r\ncareer. So she conferred upon me the dukedom of San Antonio, and sent me\r\nthe patent with a most affectionate letter. Honestly speaking, I was\r\nmore than upset by this proof of royal kindness, seeing that I had not\r\nthe least wish to accept the title. I felt equally reluctant to offend\r\nher by declining the high distinction offered, I felt sure, from a most\r\ngenerous feeling. I went to see the King, and explained my awkward\r\nposition, adding that the name of Guizot was all sufficient for me. 'You\r\nare right,' said the King. 'Leave the matter to me; I'll arrange it.'\r\nAnd he did, much to the disgust of M. de Salvandy, who had received a\r\ntitle at the same time, but who could not accept his while the Prime\r\nMinister declined.\r\n\r\n\"Then she sent me this picture. Some witty journalist said, at the time,\r\nthat it was symbolical of her own married state; for let me tell you\r\nthat the unfitness of Don Francis d'Assis was 'le secret de\r\npolichinelle,' however much your countrymen may have insisted that it\r\nonly leaked out after the union. Personally I was entirely opposed to\r\nit, and, in fact, it was not a ministerial question at all, but one of\r\ncourt intrigue. Lord Palmerston chose to make it the former, and he, and\r\nyour countrymen through him, are not only morally but virtually\r\nresponsible for the subsequent errors of Isabella. Do you know what his\r\nultimatum was when the marriage had been contracted, when there was no\r\npossibility of going back? You do not. Well, then, I will tell you. 'If\r\nIsabella has not a child within a twelvemonth, then there will be war\r\nbetween England and France.' I leave you to ponder the consequences for\r\nyourself, though I assure you that I washed my hands of the affair from\r\nthat moment. But the French as well as the English would never believe\r\nme, and history will record that 'the austere M. Guizot,' for that is\r\nwhat they choose to call me, 'lent his aid to proceedings which would\r\nmake the most debased pander blush with shame.'\r\n\r\n\"It is not the only time that my intentions have been purposely\r\nmisconceived and misconstrued; nay, I have been taxed with things of\r\nwhich I was as innocent as a child. In 1846, almost at the same period\r\nthat the Spanish imbroglio took place, Count de Montalembert got up in\r\nthe Upper House one day and declared it a disgrace that France should\r\nhave begged the tomb of Napoléon I. from Russia. Now, the fact was that\r\nFrance had not begged anything at all. The principal part of the\r\nmonument at the Invalides is the sarcophagus. The architect Visconti was\r\nanxious that it should consist of red porphyry; M. Duchâtel and myself\r\nwere of the same opinion. Unfortunately, we had not the remotest notion\r\nwhere such red porphyry was to be found. The Egyptian quarries, whence\r\nthe Romans took it, were exhausted. Inquiries were made in the Vosges,\r\nin the Pyrenees, but without result, and we were going to abandon the\r\nporphyry, when news arrived at the Ministry of the Interior that the\r\nkind of stone we wanted existed in Russia.\r\n\r\n\"Just then my colleague, M. de Salvandy, was sending M. Léouzon le Duc\r\nto the north on a special mission, and I instructed him to go as far as\r\nSt. Petersburg and consult Count de Rayneval, our ambassador, as to the\r\nbest means of getting the porphyry. A few months later, M. le Duc sent\r\nme specimens of a stone from a quarry on the banks of the Onega Lake,\r\nwhich, if not absolutely porphyry, was the nearest to it to be had. M.\r\nVisconti having approved of it, I forwarded further instructions for the\r\nquantity required, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\"The quarry, it appears, belonged to the Crown, and had never been\r\nworked, could not be worked, without due permission and the payment of a\r\ncertain tax. After a great many formalities, mainly raised by\r\nspeculators who had got wind of the affair, and had bribed various\r\nofficials to oppose, or, at any rate, intercept the petition sent by M.\r\nle Duc for the necessary authorization, Prince Wolkonsky, the Minister\r\nof State, acquainted the Czar himself with the affair, and Nicholas,\r\nwithout a moment's hesitation, granted the request, remitting the tax\r\nwhich M. le Duc had estimated at about six thousand francs. This took\r\nplace at a cabinet council, and, unfortunately for me, the Czar thought\r\nfit to make a little speech. 'What a strange destiny!' he said, rising\r\nfrom his seat and assuming a solemn tone--'what a strange destiny this\r\nman's'--alluding to Napoléon--'even in death! It is we who struck him\r\nthe first fatal blow, by the burning of our holy and venerable capital,\r\nand it is from us that France asks his tomb. Let the French envoy have\r\neverything he requires, and, above all, let no tax be taken.'\r\n\r\n\"That was enough; the German and French papers got hold of the last\r\nwords with the rest; they confounded the tax with the cost of working,\r\nwhich amounted to more than two hundred thousand francs; and up to this\r\nday, notwithstanding the explanations I and my colleagues offered in\r\nreply to the interpellation of M. de Montalembert, the story remains\r\nthat Russia made France a present of the tomb of Napoléon.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that day forth I often called upon M. Guizot, especially in the\r\ndaytime, when I knew that he had finished working; for when he found\r\nthat his political career was irrevocably at an end, he turned very\r\ncheerfully--I might say gladly--to his original avocation, literature.\r\nWithout the slightest fatigue, without the slightest worry, he produced\r\na volume of philosophical essays or history every year; and if, unlike\r\nAlexandre Dumas, he did not roar with laughter while composing, he was\r\noften heard to hum a tune. \"En effet,\" said one of his daughters, the\r\nCountess Henriette de Witt (both his daughters bore the same name and\r\ntitles when married), \"notre père ne chante presque jamais qu'en\r\ntravaillant.\" This did not mean that work, and work only, had the effect\r\nof putting M. Guizot in good humour. He was, according to the same\r\nauthority, uniformly sweet-tempered at home, whether sitting in his\r\narmchair, surrounded by his family, or gently strolling up and down his\r\nlibrary. \"C'est la politique qui le rendait méchant,\" said Madame de\r\nWitt, \"heureusement il la laissait à la porte. Et très souvent il\r\nl'oubliait de parti-pris au milieu du conseil et alors il nous écrivait\r\ndes lettres, mais des lettres, comme on n'en écrit plus. En voilà deux\r\nqu'il m'a écrites lorsque j'étais très jeune fille.\" Whereupon she\r\nshowed me what were really two charming gossiping little essays on the\r\nart of punctuation. It appears that the little lady was either very\r\nindifferent to, or ignorant of the art; and the father wrote, \"My dear\r\nHenriette, I am afraid I shall still have to take you to task with\r\nregard to your punctuation: there is little or none of it in your\r\nletters. All punctuation, commas or other signs, mark a period of repose\r\nfor the mind--a stage more or less long--an idea which is done with or\r\nmomentarily suspended, and which is being divided by such a sign from\r\nthe next. You suppress those periods, those intervals; you write as the\r\nstream flows, as the arrow flies. That will not do at all, because the\r\nideas one expresses, the things of which we speak, are not all\r\nintimately connected with one another like drops of water.\"\r\n\r\nThe second letter showed that Mdlle. Guizot must have taken her revenge,\r\neither very cleverly, or that she was past all redemption in the matter\r\nof punctuation; and as the latter theory is scarcely admissible, knowing\r\nwhat we do of her after-life, we must admit the former. The letter ran\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR HENRIETTE,\r\n\r\n     \"I dare say you will find me very provoking, but let me beg of\r\n     you not to fling so many commas at my head. You are absolutely\r\n     pelting me with them, as the Romans pelted that poor Tarpeia with\r\n     their bucklers.\"\r\n\r\nIt reminds one of Marguerite Thuillier, who \"created Mimi\" in Mürger and\r\nBarrière's \"Vie de Bohème,\" when Mürger fell in love with her. \"I can't\r\ndo with him,\" she said to his collaborateur, who pleaded for him,--\"I\r\ncan't do with him; he is too badly dressed, he looks like a scarecrow.\"\r\nBarrière advised his friend to go to a good tailor and have himself\r\nrigged out in the latest fashion. The advice was acted upon; Barrière\r\nwaited anxiously for the effect of the transformation upon the lady's\r\nheart. A fortnight elapsed, and poor Mürger was snubbed as usual.\r\nBarrière interceded once more. \"I can do less with him than before,\" was\r\nthe answer; \"he is too well dressed, he looks like a tailor's dummy.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to M. Guizot, whom, in the course of the whole of our\r\nacquaintance, I have only seen once \"put out.\" It was when the fiat went\r\nforth that his house was to come down to make room for the new Boulevard\r\nMalesherbes. The authorities had been as considerate as possible; they\r\nhad made no attempt to treat the eminent historian as a simple owner of\r\nhouse-property fighting to get the utmost value; they offered him three\r\nhundred thousand francs, and M. Guizot himself acknowledged that the sum\r\nwas a handsome one. \"But I have got thirty thousand volumes to remove,\r\nbesides my notes and manuscripts,\" he wailed. Then his good temper got\r\nthe better of him, and he had a \"sly dig\" at his former adversary,\r\nAdolphe Thiers. \"Serves me right for having so many books; happy the\r\nhistorian who prefers to trust to his imagination.\"\r\n\r\nM. Guizot made up his mind to have his library removed to Val-Richer and\r\nnever to live in Paris again; but his children and friends prevailed\r\nupon him not to forsake society altogether, and to take a modest\r\napartment near his old domicile, in the Faubourg St. Honoré, opposite\r\nthe English embassy, which, however, in those days had not the\r\nmonumental aspect it has at present.\r\n\r\n\"It is doubtful,\" said M. Guizot afterwards to me, \"whether the idea of\r\nliving in the country would have ever entered my mind ten or fifteen\r\nyears ago. At that time, I would not have gone a couple of miles to see\r\nthe most magnificent bit of natural scenery: I should have gone a\r\nthousand to see a man of talent.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, up till 1830, when he was nearly forty-four, he had never\r\nseen the sea, \"And if it had not been for an electoral journey to\r\nNormandy, I might not have seen it then.\" I pointed out to him that M.\r\nThiers had never had a country house; that he did not seem to care for\r\nnature, for birds, or for flowers.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's different,\" he smiled. \"I did not care much about the\r\ncountry, because I had never seen any of it. Thiers does not like it,\r\nbecause the birds, the flowers, the trees, live and grow without his\r\ninterference, and he does not care that anything on earth should happen\r\nwithout his having a hand in it.\"\r\n\r\nThiers was the only man at whom M. Guizot tilted in that way. Though\r\nbrought up in strict Protestant, one might almost say Calvinistic\r\nprinciples, he was an ardent admirer of Roman Catholicism, which he\r\ncalled \"the most admirable school of respect in the world.\" No man had\r\nsuffered more from the excesses of the first Revolution, seeing that his\r\nfather perished on the scaffold, yet I should not like to say that he\r\nwas not somewhat of a republican at heart, but not of a republic \"which\r\nbegins with Plato and necessarily ends with a gendarme.\" \"The republic\r\nof '48,\" he used to say, \"it had not even a Monk, let alone a Washington\r\nor a Cromwell; and Louis-Napoléon had to help himself to the throne. And\r\ndepend upon it, if there had been a Cromwell, he would have crushed it\r\nas the English one crushed the monarchy. As for Washington, he would not\r\nhave meddled with it at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said on another occasion, \"I am proud of one thing--of the\r\nauthorship of the law on elementary education; but, proud as I am of\r\nit, if I could have foreseen the uses to which it has been put, to which\r\nit is likely to be put when I am gone, I would sooner have seen half of\r\nthe nation unable to distinguish an '_A_ from a bull's foot,' as your\r\ncountrymen say.\"\r\n\r\nWith Guizot died almost the last French statesman, \"who not only thought\r\nthat he had the privilege to be poor, but who carried the privilege too\r\nfar;\" as some one remarked when he heard the news of his demise. Towards\r\nthe latter years of his life, he occupied a modest apartment, on the\r\nfourth floor, in the Rue Billaut (now the Rue Washington). Well might M.\r\nde Falloux exclaim, as he toiled up that staircase, \"My respect for him\r\nincreases with every step I take.\"\r\n\r\nSince M. de Falloux uttered these words, and very long before, I have\r\nonly known one French statesman whose staircase and whose poverty might\r\nperhaps inspire the same reflections and elicit similar praise. I am\r\nalluding to M. Rouher.\r\n\r\nM. de Lamartine's poverty did not breed the same respect. There was no\r\ndignity about it. It was the poverty of Oliver Goldsmith sending to Dr.\r\nJohnson and feasting with the guinea the latter had forwarded by the\r\nmessenger pending his own arrival. Méry had summed up the situation with\r\nregard to Lamartine's difficulties on the evening of the 24th of\r\nFebruary, '48, and there is no reason to suspect that his statement had\r\nbeen exaggerated. The dynasty of the younger branch of the Bourbons had\r\nbeen overthrown because Lamartine saw no other means of liquidating the\r\n350,000 francs he still owed for his princely journey to the East. I had\r\nbeen to Lamartine's house once before that revolution, and, though his\r\nwife was an Englishwoman, I felt no inclination to return thither. The\r\nhousehold gave me the impression of \"Du Jellaby doré.\" The sight of it\r\nwould have furnished Dickens with as good a picture as the one he\r\nsketched. The principal personage, however, was not quite so\r\ndisinterested as the future mother-in-law of Prince Turveydrop. Of\r\ncourse, at that time, there was no question of a republic, but the\r\npolitics advocated and discussed during the lunch were too superfine for\r\nhumble mortals like myself, who instinctively felt that--\r\n\r\n  \"Quelques billets de mille francs feraient bien mieux l'affaire\"\r\n\r\nof the host. And the instinct was not a deceptive one. Four months after\r\nFebruary, 1848, M. de Lamartine had virtually ceased to exist, as far\r\nas French politics were concerned. From that time until the day of his\r\ndeath, the world only heard of him in connection with a new book or new\r\npoem, the avowed purpose of which was, not to make the world better or\r\nwiser, but to raise money. He kept singing like the benighted musician\r\non the Russian steppes keeps playing his instrument, to keep away the\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nI knew not one but a dozen men, all of whom visited M. de Lamartine. I\r\nhave never been able to get a single story or anecdote about him, not\r\nbearing upon the money question. He is ten times worse in that respect\r\nthan Balzac, with this additional point in the latter's favour--that he\r\nnever whines to the outside world about his impecuniosity. M. Guizot\r\nproduces a volume every twelvemonth, and asks nothing of any one; he\r\nleaves the advertising of it to his publisher: M. de Lamartine spends\r\nenormous sums in publicity, and subsidizes, besides, a crowd of\r\njournalists, who devour his creditors' substance while he keeps\r\nrepeating to them that his books do not sell. \"If, henceforth, I were to\r\noffer pearls dissolved in the cup of Cleopatra, people would use the\r\ndecoction to wash their horses' feet.\" And, all the while, people bought\r\nhis works, though no one cared to read the later ones. The golden lyre\r\nof yore was worse than dumb; it emitted false and weak sounds, the\r\nstrings had become relaxed, the golden tongue alone remained.\r\n\r\nWhen a national subscription is raised to pay his debts, the committee\r\nare so afraid of his wasting the money that they decide to have the\r\nproceeds deposited at the Comptoir d'Escompte, and that de Lamartine\r\nshall not be able to draw a farthing until all his affairs are settled.\r\nOne morning he deputes a friend to ask for forty thousand francs, in\r\norder to pay some bills that are due. They refuse to advance the money.\r\nDe Lamartine invites them to his own house, but they stand firm at\r\nfirst. Gradually they give way. \"How much do you really want?\" is the\r\nquestion asked at last. \"Fifty thousand francs,\" is the answer; \"but I\r\nfancy I shall be able to manage with thirty thousand francs.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we gave you fifty thousand francs,\" says M. Émile Pereire, \"would\r\nyou give us some breathing-time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Lamartine pockets the fifty thousand francs, thanks to his\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nA better man, though not so great a poet, was Béranger, whom I knew for\r\nmany years, though my intimacy with him did not commence until a few\r\nmonths after the February revolution, when I met him coming out of the\r\nPalais-Bourbon. \"I shall feel obliged,\" he said, \"if you will see me\r\nhome, for I am not at all well; these violent scenes are not at all to\r\nmy taste.\" Then, with a very wistful smile, he went on: \"I have been\r\naccused of having held 'the plank across the brook over which\r\nLouis-Philippe went to the Tuileries.' I wish I could be the bridge\r\nacross the channel on which he would return now. Certainly I would have\r\nliked a republic, but not such a one as we are having in there,\"\r\npointing to the home of the Constituent Assembly. A short while after,\r\nBéranger tendered his resignation as deputy.\r\n\r\nHe lived at Passy then, in the Rue Basse; the number, if I mistake not,\r\nwas twenty-three. He had lived in the same quarter fifteen years before,\r\nfor I used to see him take his walks when I was a lad, but it was\r\ndifficult for Béranger to live in the same spot for any length of time.\r\nHe was, first of all, of a very nomadic disposition; secondly, his\r\nquondam friends would leave him no peace. There was a constant inroad of\r\nshady individuals who, on the pretext that he was \"the people's poet,\"\r\ndrained his purse and his cellar. Previous to his return to Passy, he\r\nhad been boarding with a respectable widow in the neighbourhood of\r\nVincennes. He had adopted the name of Bonnin, and his landlady took him\r\nto be a modest, retired tradesman, living upon a small annuity. When his\r\nbirthday came round, she and her daughters found out that they had\r\nentertained an angel unawares, for carriage after carriage drove up, and\r\nin a few hours the small dwelling was filled with magnificent flowers,\r\nthe visitors meanwhile surrounding Béranger, and offering him their\r\ncongratulations. As a matter of course, the rumour spread, and Béranger\r\nfled to Passy, where he invited Mdlle. Judith Frère to join him once\r\nmore. The retreat had been discovered, and he resigned himself to be\r\nbadgered more than usual for the sake of the neighbourhood--the Bois de\r\nBoulogne was hard by; but the municipal council of Passy, in\r\nconsideration of the honour conferred upon the arrondissement and\r\nBéranger's charity, took it into their heads to pass a resolution\r\noffering Béranger the most conspicuous place in the cemetery for a tomb.\r\nThe poet fled once more, this time to the Quartier-Latin; but the\r\nstudents insisting on pointing him out to their female companions, who,\r\nin their enthusiasm, made it a point of embracing him on every possible\r\noccasion, especially in the \"Closerie des Lilas\"--for to the end\r\nBéranger remained fond of the society of young folk,--Béranger was\r\ncompelled to flit once more. After a short stay in the Rue Vendôme, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Temple, he came to the Quartier-Beaujon, where\r\nI visited him.\r\n\r\nThere have been so many tales with regard to Béranger's companion,\r\nMdlle. Judith Frère, and all equally erroneous, that I am glad to be\r\nable to rectify them. Mdlle. Frère was by no means the kind of upper\r\nservant she was generally supposed to be. A glance at her face and a few\r\nmoments spent in her company could not fail to convince any one that she\r\nwas of good birth. She had befriended Béranger when he was very young,\r\nthey had parted for some time, and they ended their days together, for\r\nthe poet only survived his friend three months. Béranger was a model of\r\nhonesty and disinterestedness. Ambition he had little or none; he was\r\nsomewhat fond of teasing children, not because he had no affection for\r\nthem, but because he loved them too much. His portrait by Ary Scheffer\r\nis the most striking likeness I have ever seen; but a better one still,\r\nperhaps, is by an artist who had probably never set eyes on him. I am\r\nalluding to Hablot Browne, who unconsciously reproduced him to the life\r\nin the picture of Tom Pinch. As a companion, Béranger was charming to a\r\ndegree. I have never heard him say a bitter word. The day I saw him\r\nhome, I happened to say to him, \"You ought to be pleased, Victor Hugo is\r\nin the same regiment with you.\" \"Yes,\" he answered, \"he is in the band.\"\r\nHe would never accept a pension from Louis-Napoléon, but he had no\r\nbitterness against him. Lamartine was very bitter, and yet consented to\r\nthe Emperor's heading of the subscription-list in his behalf. That alone\r\nwould show the difference between the two men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n     Some men of the Empire -- Fialin de Persigny -- The public\r\n     prosecutor's opinion of him expressed at the trial for high\r\n     treason in 1836 -- Superior in many respects to Louis-Napoléon --\r\n     The revival of the Empire his only and constant dream -- In order\r\n     to realize it, he appeals first to Jérôme, ex-King of Westphalia\r\n     -- De Persigny's estimate of him -- Jérôme's greed and\r\n     Louis-Napoléon's generosity -- De Persigny's financial\r\n     embarrassments -- His charity -- What the Empire really meant to\r\n     him -- De Persigny virtually the moving spirit in the Coup d'État\r\n     -- Louis-Napoléon might have been satisfied with the presidency\r\n     of the republic for life -- Persigny seeks for aid in England --\r\n     Palmerston's share in the Coup d'État -- The submarine cable --\r\n     Preparations for the Coup d'État -- A warning of it sent to\r\n     England -- Count Walewski issues invitations for a dinner-party\r\n     on the 2nd of December -- Opinion in London that Louis-Napoléon\r\n     will get the worst in the struggle with the Chamber -- The last\r\n     funds from London -- General de Saint-Arnaud and Baron Lacrosse\r\n     -- The Élysée-Bourbon on the evening of the 1st of December -- I\r\n     pass the Élysée at midnight -- Nothing unusual -- London on the\r\n     2nd of December -- The dinner at Count Walewski's put off at the\r\n     last moment -- Illuminations at the French Embassy a few hours\r\n     later -- Palmerston at the Embassy -- Some traits of De\r\n     Persigny's character -- His personal affection for Louis-Napoléon\r\n     -- Madame de Persigny -- Her parsimony -- Her cooking of the\r\n     household accounts -- Chevet and Madame de Persigny -- What the\r\n     Empire might have been with a Von Moltke by the side of the\r\n     Emperor instead of Vaillant, Niel, and Leboeuf -- Colonel\r\n     (afterwards General) Fleury the only modest man among the\r\n     Emperor's entourage -- De Persigny's pretensions as a Heaven-born\r\n     statesman -- Mgr. de Mérode -- De Morny -- His first meeting with\r\n     his half-brother -- De Morny as a grand seigneur -- The origin of\r\n     the Mexican campaign -- Walewski -- His fads -- Rouher -- My\r\n     first sight of him in the Quartier-Latin -- The Emperor's opinion\r\n     of him at the beginning of his career -- Rouher in his native\r\n     home, Auvergne -- His marriage -- Madame Rouher -- His\r\n     father-in-law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A man endowed with a strong will and energy, active and intelligent to\r\na degree, with the faculty of turning up at every spot where his\r\npresence was necessary either to revive the lagging plot or to gain\r\nfresh adherents; a man better acquainted than all the rest with the\r\nsecret springs upon which the conspiracy hung.\"\r\n\r\nThis description of M. de Persigny is borrowed from the indictment at\r\nthe trial for high treason in 1836. Every particular of it is correct,\r\nyet it is a very one-sided diagnosis of the character of Napoléon's\r\nstaunchest henchman. If I had had to paint him morally and mentally in\r\none line, I should, without intending to be irreverent, have called him\r\nthe John the Baptist of the revived Napoleonic legend. There could be no\r\ndoubt about his energy, his activity, and his intelligence; in respect\r\nto the former two he was absolutely superior to Louis-Napoléon, but\r\nthey, the activity and energy and intelligence, would only respond to\r\nthe bidding of one voice, that of the first Napoléon from the grave,\r\nwhich, he felt sure, had appointed him the chief instrument for the\r\nrestoration of the Empire. It was the dream that haunted his sleep, that\r\npursued him when awake. Let it not be thought, though, that\r\nLouis-Napoléon appeared to him as the one selected by Providence to\r\nrealize that dream. Loyal and faithful as he was to him from the day\r\nthey met until his (Persigny's) death, he would have been equally loyal\r\nand faithful, though perhaps not so deeply attached, to Jérôme, the\r\nex-King of Westphalia, to whom he appealed first. But the youngest of\r\nthe great Napoléon's brothers did not relish adventures, and he turned a\r\ndeaf ear to Persigny's proposals, as he did later on to those of M.\r\nThiers, who wished him to become a candidate for the presidency of the\r\nSecond Republic.\r\n\r\nI was talking one day on the subject of the latter's refusal to De\r\nPersigny, several years after the advent of the Empire, and commending\r\nJérôme for his abnegation of self and his fealty to his nephew. There\r\nwas a sneer on Persigny's face such as I had never seen there before;\r\nfor though he was by no means good-tempered, and frequently very\r\nviolent, he generally left the members of the Imperial family alone. He\r\nnoticed my surprise, and explained at once. \"It is very evident that you\r\ndo not know Jérôme, nor did I until a few years ago. There is not a\r\nsingle one of the great Napoléon's brothers who really had his glory at\r\nheart; it meant money and position to them, that is all. Do you know why\r\nJérôme did not fall in with my views and those of M. Thiers? Well, I\r\nwill tell you. He was afraid that his nephew Louis and the rest of the\r\nfamily would be a burden on him; he preferred that others should take\r\nthe chestnuts out of the fire and that he should have the eating of\r\nthem. That is what his self-abnegation meant, nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nI am afraid that De Persigny was not altogether wrong in his estimate of\r\nthe ex-King of Westphalia. He was insatiable in his demands for money to\r\nhis nephew. In fact, with the exception of Princesse Mathilde, the whole\r\nof the Emperor's family was a thorn in his side.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor himself was absolutely incapable of refusing a service. I\r\nhave the following story on very good authority. De Persigny, who was as\r\nlavish as his Imperial master, was rarely ever out of difficulties, and\r\nin such emergencies naturally appealed to the latter. He had wasted on,\r\nor sunk enormous sums in, his country estate of Chamarande, where he\r\nentertained with boundless hospitality. As a matter of course, he was\r\nalways being pursued by his creditors. One early morn--Persigny always\r\nwent betimes when he wanted money--he made his appearance in the\r\nEmperor's private room, looking sad and dejected. Napoléon refrained for\r\na while from questioning him as to the cause of his low spirits, but\r\nfinally ventured to say that he looked ill.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sire,\" was the answer, \"I am simply bent down with sorrow. This\r\nChamarande, which I have created out of nothing as it were\"--it had cost\r\nnearly two millions of francs--\"is ruining me. I shall be forced to give\r\nit up.\"\r\n\r\nDe Persigny felt sure that he would be told there and then not to worry\r\nhimself; but the Emperor was in a jocular mood, and took delight in\r\nprolonging his anxiety. \"Believe me, my dear duc,\" said Napoléon with an\r\nassumed air of indifference, \"it is the best thing you can do. Get rid\r\nof Chamarande; it is too great a burden, and you'll breathe more freely\r\nwhen it's gone.\"\r\n\r\nDe Persigny turned as white as a ghost; whereupon Napoléon, who was\r\nsoft-hearted to a degree, took a bundle of notes from his drawer and\r\nhanded them to him. De Persigny went away beaming.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from this that De Persigny was grasping like\r\nPrince Jérôme and others, who constantly drained Napoléon's purse. De\r\nPersigny's charity was proverbial, but he gave blindly, and as a\r\nconsequence, was frequently imposed upon. When young he had joined the\r\nSaint-Simoniens; his great aim was to make everybody happy. To him the\r\nrestoration of the Empire meant not only the revival of Napoléon's\r\nglory, but the era of universal happiness, of universal material\r\nprosperity. As a rule, he was thoroughly unpractical; the whole of his\r\nlife's work may be summed up in one line--he conceived and organized the\r\nCoup d'État. As such he was virtually the founder of the Second Empire.\r\nIn that task practice went hand in hand with theory; when the task was\r\naccomplished, his inspiration was utterly at fault.\r\n\r\nHistorians have been generally content to attribute the principal rôle\r\nin the Coup d'État, next to that of Louis-Napoléon, to M. de Morny. Of\r\ncourse, I am speaking of those who conceived it, not of those who\r\nexecuted it. The parts of Generals Magnan and De Saint-Arnaud, of\r\nColonel de Bèville and M. de Maupas, scarcely admit of discussion. But\r\nthe fact is that De Morny did comparatively nothing as far as the\r\nconception was concerned. The prime mover was undoubtedly De Persigny,\r\nand it is a very moot question whether, but for him, it would have been\r\nconceived at all. I know I am treading on dangerous ground, but I have\r\nvery good authority for the whole of the following notes relating to it.\r\nIn De Persigny's mind the whole of the scheme was worked out prior to\r\nLouis-Napoléon's election to the presidency, though of course the\r\nsuccess of it depended on that election. He did not want a republic,\r\neven with Louis-Napoléon as a president for life; he wanted an empire. I\r\nshould not like to affirm that Prince Louis would _not_ have been\r\ncontent with such a position; it was Persigny who put down his foot,\r\nexclaiming, \"_Aut Cæsar, aut nullus!_\" That the sentence fell upon\r\nwilling ears, there is equally no doubt, and when the Prince-President\r\nhad his foot upon the first rung of the ladder, he would probably have\r\nrushed, or endeavoured to rush, to the top at once, regardless of the\r\nrisk involved in this perilous ascent, for there would have been no one,\r\nabsolutely no one, to steady the ladder at the bottom. De Persigny held\r\nhim back while he busied himself in finding not only the _personnel_\r\nthat was to hold the latter, but the troops that would prevent the crowd\r\nfrom interfering with the ladder-holders. It was he who was the first to\r\nbroach the recall of De Saint-Arnaud from Africa; it was he who drew\r\nattention to M. de Maupas, then little more than an obscure prefect; it\r\nwas he who was wise enough to see that \"the ladder-holders\" would have\r\nto be sought for in England, and not in France. \"The English,\" he said\r\nto Napoléon, \"owe you a good turn for the harm they have done to your\r\nuncle. They are sufficiently generous or sufficiently sensible to do\r\nthat good turn, if it is in their interest to do so; look for your\r\nsupport among the English.\"\r\n\r\nI fancy it was Lord Palmerston's dislike of Louis-Philippe on account of\r\n\"the Spanish marriages,\" rather than a sentiment of generosity towards\r\nLouis-Napoléon, that made him espouse his cause, but I feel certain that\r\nhe did espouse it. I have good ground for saying that his interviews\r\nwith Comte Walewski were much more frequent than his ministerial\r\ncolleagues suspected, or the relations between England and France,\r\nhowever friendly they may have been, warranted. But everything was not\r\nready. Palmerston and Walewski on the English side of the Channel,\r\nLouis-Napoléon and De Persigny on the French side, were waiting for\r\nsomething. What was it? Nothing more nor less than the laying of the\r\nsubmarine cable between Dover and Calais, the concession for which was\r\ngiven on the 8th of January, 1851, and on which occasion the last words\r\nto Mr. Walker Breit were to hurry it on as much as possible, \"_seeing\r\nthat it is of the utmost importance for the French Government to be in\r\ndirect and rapid communication with the Cabinet of St. James_.\" The\r\nCabinet meant Lord Palmerston. Nevertheless, it is not until ten months\r\nlater that the cable is laid, and from that moment events march apace.\r\nLet us glance at them for a moment. Telegraphic communication between\r\nDover and Calais is established on the 13th of November. On the 15th,\r\nGeneral Saint-Arnaud gives orders that the degree of 1849, conferring on\r\nthe president of the National Assembly the right of summoning and\r\ndisposing of the military forces which had hitherto been hung up in\r\nevery barracks throughout the land, shall be taken down. On the 16th,\r\nChangarnier, Leflo, and Baze, with many others, decide that a bill shall\r\nbe introduced immediately, conferring once more that right on the\r\npresident of the Assembly. The opponents of the Prince-President are\r\nalready rubbing their hands with glee at the thought of their success,\r\nfor it means that Prince Louis and his adherents will be in their power,\r\nand in their power means removal to Vincennes or elsewhere, as prisoners\r\nof State. On the 18th, the bill is thrown out by a majority of 108, and\r\nthe Assembly is virtually powerless henceforth against any and every\r\nattack from the military. It was on that very evening that the date of\r\nthe Coup d'État was fixed for the 2nd of December, notwithstanding the\r\nhesitation and wavering of Louis-Napoléon. On the 26th a young attaché\r\nis despatched from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the French Embassy\r\nin London, instead of the ordinary cabinet (or queen's) messenger, which\r\nproves that the despatches are more important than usual. They contain\r\nletters from the Prince-President himself to Comte Walewski, the\r\ncontents of which are probably known to the Marquis de Turgot, but which\r\nare despatched in that way, instead of being sent directly from the\r\nÉlysée by a trustworthy person, because the presidential residence is\r\nwatched day and night by the \"counter-police\" of the Assembly. The\r\nreason why the Marquis de Turgot selects a young aristocrat is because\r\nhe feels certain that he cannot be tampered with. On the 29th of\r\nNovember a connection of mine receives a letter from a friend in London,\r\nwho is supposed to be behind the scenes, but who this time is utterly in\r\nthe dark. It is to the following effect: \"There is something in the\r\nwind, but I know not what. Both yesterday morning (27th) and to-day\r\nWalewski has been closeted for more than two hours each time with\r\nPalmerston. There is to be a grand dinner at Walewski's on the second of\r\nnext month, to which I received an invitation. Can you tell me what\r\nmischief is brewing?\"\r\n\r\nThe recipient of the letter was neither better nor worse informed than\r\nthe rest of us, and in spite of all the assertions to the contrary which\r\nhave been made since, no one foresaw the crisis in the shape it came\r\nupon us. On the contrary, the general opinion was that in the end\r\nLouis-Napoléon would get the worse, in spite of the magic influence of\r\nhis name with the army. It was expected that if the troops were called\r\nupon to act against the National Assembly, they would refuse and turn\r\nagainst their leaders. I am by no means certain that the\r\nPrince-President did not entertain a similar opinion up to the last\r\nmoment, for I have it on excellent authority that as late as the 26th of\r\nNovember he endeavoured to postpone the affair for a month. It was then\r\nthat De Persigny showed his teeth, and insisted upon the night of the\r\n1st or 2nd of December as the latest. The interview was a very stormy\r\none. On that very morning De Persigny had received a letter from London,\r\nnot addressed to his residence. It contained a draft for £2000, but with\r\nthe intimation that these would be the last funds forthcoming. He showed\r\nthe Prince-President the letter, and Napoléon gave in there and then.\r\nThe letters spoken of just now were despatched on the same day. It was\r\nwith that money that the Coup d'État was made, and all the stories about\r\na million and a half of francs being handed respectively to De Morny, De\r\nMaupas, Saint-Arnaud, and the rest are so much invention.\r\n\r\nUp to six o'clock in the afternoon of the 1st of December, General de\r\nSaint-Arnaud was virtually undecided, not with regard to the necessity\r\nof the Coup d'État, but with regard to the opportuneness of it within\r\nthe next twelve hours. I have the following story from the lips of\r\nBaron Lacrosse, who was one of the actors in it. On the eve of the Coup\r\nd'État he was Minister of Public Works, and as such was present at the\r\nsitting of the Assembly on the 1st of December. A member ascended the\r\ntribune to interpellate the Minister for War, and, the latter being\r\nabsent, the question was deferred until next day. That same evening, 1st\r\nof December, there was an official dinner at M. Daviel's, the Minister\r\nof Justice, and at the termination of the sitting, M. Lacrosse called in\r\nhis carriage at the Ministry for War to take his colleague. \"You may\r\nmake up your mind for a warm half-hour to-morrow,\" he said with a smile,\r\nas he entered General Saint-Arnaud's room. \"Why?\" asked the general.\r\n\"You are going to be interpellated.\" \"I expected as much, and was just\r\nconsidering my answer. I am glad you warned me in time. I think I know\r\nwhat to say now.\"\r\n\r\nI do not believe that Baron Lacrosse had the faintest inkling of the\r\nreal drift of the remark, nor have I ever asked him directly whether he\r\nhad. As far as I could gather afterwards from one or two people who were\r\nthere, the Élysée presented no unusual feature that night. The reception\r\nwas well attended, as the ordinary receptions on Mondays generally were,\r\nfor the times had gone by when the courtyard was a howling wilderness\r\ndotted with two, or perhaps three, hackney cabs. It would appear that a\r\ngreat many well-known men and a corresponding number of pretty women\r\nmoved as usual through the salons, only one of which was shut up, that\r\nat the very end of the suite, and which did duty as a council-chamber,\r\nand contained the portrait of the then young Emperor of Austria,\r\nFrancis-Joseph. But this was scarcely noticed, nor did the early\r\nwithdrawal of the Prince-President provoke any comment, for it happened\r\npretty often. Very certain is it that at twelve o'clock that night the\r\nÉlysée was wrapt in darkness, for I happened to pass there at that hour.\r\nStanding at the door, or rather inside it, was the captain of the guard,\r\nsmoking a cigar. I believe it was Captain Desondes of the \"Guides,\" but\r\nI will not be sure, for I was not near enough to distinguish plainly.\r\nThe Faubourg St. Honoré was pretty well deserted, save for a few\r\nindividuals prowling about; they were probably detectives in the pay of\r\nthe Prince-President's adversaries.\r\n\r\nLet me return for a moment to London, and give an account of what\r\nhappened there on the 2nd of December, as supplied by the writer of the\r\nabove-mentioned letter, in an epistle which reached Paris only on the\r\n7th.\r\n\r\nIt appears that on the day of the Coup d'État London woke up amidst a\r\ndense fog. Virtually the news of what happened in Paris early that\r\nmorning did not spread until between two and three o'clock. Our\r\ninformant had been invited to a dinner-party at the French Embassy that\r\nnight, and though in no way actively connected with politics, he was\r\nasking himself whether he should go or stay away, when, at five o'clock,\r\nhe received a note from the Embassy, saying that the dinner would not\r\ntake place. The fact was that at the eleventh hour the whole of the\r\ncorps diplomatique had sent excuses. Our friend went to his club, had\r\nhis dinner, and spent part of the evening there. At about eleven a crony\r\nof his came in, and seeing him seated in the smoking-room, exclaimed,\r\n\"Why, I thought you were going to Walewski's dinner and reception.\" \"So\r\nI was,\" remarked our friend, \"but it was countermanded at five.\"\r\n\"Countermanded? Why, I passed the Embassy just now, and it was blazing\r\nwith light. Come and look.\"\r\n\r\nThey took a cab, and sure enough the building was positively\r\nilluminated. Our friend went in, and the salons were crammed to\r\nsuffocation. Lord Palmerston was talking animatedly to Count Walewski;\r\nthe whole corps diplomatique accredited to the court of St. James was\r\nthere. The fact was that about nine or half-past the most favourable\r\nnews from Paris had reached London. The report soon spread that Lord\r\nPalmerston had officially adhered to the Coup d'État, and that he had\r\ntelegraphed in that sense to the various English embassies abroad\r\nwithout even consulting his fellow-ministers.\r\n\r\nI believe our friend was correctly informed, for it is well known that\r\nPalmerston did not resign, but was virtually dismissed from office. He\r\nnever went to Windsor to give up the seals; Lord John Russell had to do\r\nit for him. Persigny, therefore, considered that he had fallen in the\r\ncause of Louis-Napoléon, and as such he became little short of an idol.\r\nThe Prince-President himself was not far from sharing in that worship.\r\nNot once, but a hundred times, his familiars have heard him say, \"Avec\r\nPalmerston on peut faire des grandes choses.\" Nevertheless, Palmerston\r\nappealed more to De Persigny's imagination than to Louis-Napoléon's.\r\nAfter all, he was perhaps much more of a Richelieu than a constitutional\r\nminister in a constitutional country has a right to be nowadays, and\r\nthat was what Persigny admired above all things. His long stay in\r\nEngland had by no means removed his inherent dislike to parliamentary\r\ngovernment, and, rightly or wrongly, he credited Palmerston with a\r\nsimilar sentiment.\r\n\r\nDe Persigny was amiable and obliging enough, provided one knew how to\r\nmanage him, and with those whom he liked, but exceedingly thin-skinned\r\nand often violent with those whom he disliked. He was, moreover, very\r\njealous with regard to Louis-Napoléon's affection for him. I doubt\r\nwhether he really minded the influence wielded by the Empress, De Morny,\r\nand Walewski over the Emperor, but he grudged them their place in the\r\nEmperor's heart. This was essentially the case with regard to the\r\nformer. He would have been glad to see his old friend and Imperial\r\nmaster contract a loveless marriage with some insignificant German or\r\nRussian princess, who would have borne her husband few or many children,\r\nin order to secure the safety of the dynasty, but the passion that\r\nprompted the union with Eugénie de Montijo he considered virtually as an\r\ninjury to himself. I give his opinion on that subject in English,\r\nbecause, though expressed in French, it had certainly been inspired by\r\nhis sojourn in England. \"When love invades a man's heart, there is\r\nscarcely any room left for friendship. You cannot drive love for a woman\r\nand friendship for a man in double harness, you are obliged to drive\r\nthem tandem; and what is worse in a case like that of the Emperor,\r\nfriendship becomes the leader and love the wheeler. Of course, to the\r\noutsider, friendship has the place of honour; in reality, love, the\r\nwheeler, is in closest contact with the driver and the vehicle, and can,\r\nmoreover, have a sly kick at friendship, the leader. Personally, I am an\r\nexception--I may say a phenomenal exception--because my affection for\r\nthe Emperor is as strong as my love for my wife.\"\r\n\r\nThose who knew both the Emperor and Madame de Persigny might have fitly\r\nargued that this equal division of affection was a virtual injustice to\r\nthe sovereign, who was decidedly more amiable than the spouse. The\r\nformer rarely did a spiteful thing from personal motives of revenge; I\r\nonly know of two. He never invited Lady Jersey to the Tuileries during\r\nthe Empire, because she had shown her dislike of him when he was in\r\nLondon; he exiled David d'Angers because the sculptor had refused to\r\nfinish the monument of Queen Hortense after the Coup-d'État. David\r\nd'Angers was one of the noblest creatures that ever lived, and I mean to\r\nspeak of him at greater length. On the other hand, Madame de Persigny\r\nmade her husband's life, notwithstanding his love for her, a burden by\r\nher whimsical disposition, her vindictive temperament, and her\r\ncheeseparing in everything except her own lavish expenditure on dress.\r\nShe was what the French call \"une femme qui fait des scènes;\" she almost\r\nprided herself upon being superior in birth to her husband, though in\r\nthat respect there was really not a pin to choose between her\r\ngrandfather, Michel Ney, the stable-boy, who had risen to be a duke of\r\nthe First Empire, and her husband, the sergeant-quartermaster Fialin,\r\nwho became Duc de Persigny under the second. She was always advocating\r\nretrenchment in the household. \"True,\" said Persigny, \"she cuts down her\r\ndresses too, but the more she cuts, the more they cost.\" For in his\r\nangry moments he would now and then tell a story against his wife. Here\r\nis one. Persigny, as I have already said, was hospitable to a fault, but\r\nhe had always to do battle when projecting a grand entertainment. \"There\r\nwas so much trouble with the servants, and as for the chef, his\r\nextravagance knew no bounds.\" So said madame; and sick at last of always\r\nhearing the same complaints, he decided to let Chevet provide. All went\r\nwell at first, because he himself went to the Palais-Royal to give his\r\norders, merely stating the number of guests, and leaving the rest to the\r\nfamous caterers, than whom there are no more obliging or conscientious\r\npurveyors anywhere. After a little while he began to leave the\r\narrangements to madame; she herself sent out the invitations, so there\r\ncould be no mistake with regard to the number. He soon perceived,\r\nhowever, that the dinners, if not inferior in quality to the former\r\nones, were decidedly inferior in quantity. At last, one evening, when\r\nthere were twenty-six people round the board, there was not enough for\r\ntwenty, and next day De Persigny took the road to the Palais-Royal once\r\nmore to lodge his complaint personally. \"Comment, monsieur le comte,\"\r\nwas the reply of one of the principals, \"vous dites qu'il y avait\r\nvingt-six convives et qu'il n'y avait pas de quoi nourrir vingt; je vous\r\ncrois parfaitement; voilà la commande de madame la comtesse, copiée dans\r\nnotre registre: 'Dîner chez M. de Persigny pour seize personnes.'\"\r\n\r\nMadame had simply pocketed, or intended to pocket, fifteen hundred\r\nfrancs--for Chevet rarely charged less than a hundred and fifty francs\r\nper head, wines included--and had endeavoured to make the food for\r\nsixteen do for twenty-six. Of course there was a scene. Madame promised\r\namendment, and the husband was only too willing to believe. The\r\namendment was worse than the original offence, for one night the whole\r\nof the supper-table, set out à la Française, _i. e._, with everything on\r\nit, gave way, because, her own dining-table having proved too small, she\r\nhad declined Chevet's offer of providing one at a cost of seven or eight\r\nfrancs, and sent for a jobbing carpenter to put together some boards and\r\ntrestles at the cost of two francs. Chevet managed to provide another\r\nbanquet within three quarters of an hour, which, with the one that had\r\nbeen spoiled, was put in the bill. Within a comparatively short time of\r\nher husband's death, early in the seventies, Madame de Persigny\r\ncontracted a second marriage, in direct opposition to the will of her\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nMost of the men in the immediate entourage of the Emperor were\r\nintoxicated with their sudden leap into power, but of course the\r\nintoxication manifested itself in different ways. A good many considered\r\nthemselves the composers of the Napoleonic Opera--for it was really such\r\nin the way it held the stage of France for eighteen years, the usual\r\ntragic finale not even being wanting. With the exception of De Persigny,\r\nthey were in reality but the orchestral performers, and he, to give him\r\nhis utmost due, was only the orchestrator of the score and part author\r\nof the libretto. The original themes had been composed by the exile of\r\nSt. Helena, and were so powerfully attractive to, and so constantly\r\nhaunting, the ears of the majority of Frenchmen as to have required no\r\noutward aid to remembrance for thirty-five years, though I do not forget\r\neither Thiers' works, Victor Hugo's poetry, Louis-Philippe's generous\r\ntransfer of the great captain's remains to France, nor Louis-Napoléon's\r\nown attempts at Strasburg and Boulogne, all of which contributed to that\r\neffect. Nevertheless, all the artisans of the Coup d'État considered\r\nthemselves nearly as great geniuses as the intellectual and military\r\ngiant who conceived and executed the 19th Brumaire, and pretended to\r\nimpose their policy upon Europe by imposing their will upon the Emperor,\r\nthough not one could hold a candle to him in statecraft. Napoléon with a\r\nMoltke by his side would have been a match for Bismarck, and the left\r\nbank of the Rhine _might_ have been French; Alsace-Lorraine would\r\ncertainly not have been German. It is not my purpose, however, to enter\r\nupon politics. I repeat, De Persigny, De Morny, and to a certain extent\r\nWalewski, endeavoured to exalt themselves into political Napoléons at\r\nall times and seasons; De Saint-Arnaud felt convinced that the\r\nstrategical mantle of the great warrior had fallen upon him; De Maupas\r\nfancied himself another Fouché. The only one who was really free from\r\npretensions of either kind was Colonel (afterwards General) Fleury. He\r\nwas the only modest man among the lot.\r\n\r\nThe greatest offender in that way was, no doubt, De Persigny. During his\r\njourney to Rome in 1866 he did not hesitate to tender his political\r\nadvice to such past masters in diplomacy as Pius IX. and Cardinal\r\nAntonelli. Both pretended to profit by the lesson, but Mgr. de\r\nMérode,[52] who was not quite so patient, had many an animated\r\ndiscussion with him, in which De Persigny frequently got the worst. One\r\nevening the latter thought fit to twit him with his pugnaciousness. \"I\r\nsuppose, monsignor,\" he said, \"it's the ancient leaven of the trooper\r\ngetting the upper hand now and then.\" \"True,\" replied the prelate; \"I\r\nwas a captain in the foreign legion, and fought in Africa, where I got\r\nmy cross of the Legion of Honour. But you, monsieur le duc, I fancy I\r\nhave heard that you were more or less of a sergeant-quartermaster in a\r\ncavalry regiment.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 52: Frédéric Xavier de Mérode was the descendant of\r\n         an ancient Flemish family, and became an influential member of\r\n         the Prelatura. He took an active share in the organization of\r\n         the Papal troops which fought at Mentana. There is a romantic\r\n         but absolutely true story connected with his military career.\r\n         He was from his very youth intended for the priesthood, but one\r\n         day, when he was but nineteen, he had a quarrel with a\r\n         fellow-student, who gave him a box on the ears. M. de Mérode\r\n         was too conscientious a Catholic to fight a duel, and still his\r\n         pride forbade him to remain under the imputation of being a\r\n         coward. So he enlisted first in a Belgian, subsequently in a\r\n         foreign regiment, and proved his courage. He was very\r\n         hot-tempered, and had frequent disagreements with Generals\r\n         Lamoricière and De Guyon, and even with Pius IX. himself, who,\r\n         on the occasion of the promulgation of the decree of\r\n         infallibility, positively forbade him to enter the Vatican\r\n         again. But he soon afterwards made his peace with the Pontiff.\r\n         His worst enemies--and he had many--never questioned his\r\n         sincerity and loyalty.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nMgr. de Mérode could have done De Persigny no greater injury than to\r\nremind him of his humble origin. He always winced under such allusions;\r\nhis constant preoccupation was to make people forget it, and he often\r\nexposed himself to ridicule in the attempt. He knew nothing about art,\r\nand yet he would speak about it, not as if he had studied the subject,\r\nbut as if he had been brought up in a refined society, where the\r\natmosphere had been impregnated with it. As a matter of course, he\r\nbecame an easy victim to the picture-dealers and bric-à-brac merchants.\r\nI remember his silver being taken to the mint during the Siege. He had\r\npaid an enormous price for it on the dealer's representation that it was\r\nantique: \"C'est du Louis XV. tout pur.\" \"Tellement pur que c'est du\r\nVictoria,\" said a connoisseur; and he was not mistaken, for it had been\r\nmanufactured by a firm of London silversmiths. But it was a compliment\r\nfor all that to the Queen.\r\n\r\nWith all his faults, De Persigny was at heart a better man than De\r\nMorny, who affected to look down upon him. True, the latter had none of\r\nhis glaring defects, neither had he any of his sterling virtues. One\r\nevening, in January, 1849, when the Prince-President had been less than\r\na month at the Élysée, a closed carriage drove into the courtyard and\r\nstopped before the flight of steps leading to the hall, which, like the\r\nrest of the building, was already wrapt in semi-darkness. A gentleman\r\nalighted who was evidently expected, for the officer on duty conducted\r\nhim almost without a word to the private apartments of the President,\r\nwhere the latter was walking up and down, the usual cigarette between\r\nhis lips, evidently greatly preoccupied and visibly impatient. The door\r\nhad scarcely opened when the Prince's face, generally so difficult to\r\nread, lighted up as if by magic. Before the officer had time to announce\r\nthe visitor, the prince stepped forward, held out his hand, and with the\r\nother clasped the new-comer to his breast. The officer knew the visitor.\r\nIt was the Comte Auguste de Morny. As a matter of course he retired, and\r\nsaw and heard no more. I had the above account from his own lips, and he\r\nfelt certain that this was the first time the brothers had ever met.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Morny was close upon forty then, and for at least half of\r\nthat time had been emancipated from all restraint; he was a well-known\r\nfigure in the society of Louis-Philippe's reign; he had been a deputy\r\nfor one of the constituencies in Auvergne; at the period of his first\r\nmeeting with Louis-Napoléon he was at the head of an important\r\nindustrial establishment down that way, and one fain asks one's self why\r\nhe had waited until then to shake his brother's hand. The answer is not\r\ndifficult. There is an oft-repeated story about De Morny having been at\r\nthe Opéra-Comique during the evening of the 1st of December, 1851.\r\nRumours of the Coup d'État were rife, and a lady said, \"Il paraît qu'on\r\nva donner un fameux coup de balai. De quel côté serez vous, M. de\r\nMorny?\" \"Soyez sure, madame, que je serai du côté du manche.\" Morny\r\nalways averred that he had said nothing of the kind. \"They invented it\r\nafterwards, perhaps because they credited me with the instinctive\r\nfaculty of being on the winning side, the side of the handle, in any and\r\nevery emergency.\"\r\n\r\nI think one may safely accept that version, and that is why he refrained\r\nfrom claiming his brother's friendship and acquaintance until he felt\r\nalmost certain that the latter was fingering the handle of the broom\r\nthat was to make a clean sweep of the Second Republic. It is difficult\r\nto determine how much or how little he contributed to the success of\r\nthat sweep, but I have an idea that it was very little. One thing is\r\nvery certain, for I have it on very good--I may say, the\r\nbest--authority. He did not contribute any money to the undertaking; he\r\nendeavoured to raise funds from others, but he himself did not loosen\r\nhis purse-strings; when, curiously enough, he was the only one among the\r\nimmediate entourage of Louis-Napoléon whose purse-strings were worth\r\nloosening.\r\n\r\nAllowing for the difference of sex, better breeding and better\r\neducation, De Morny often reminded one of Rachel. They possessed the\r\nsame powers of fascination, and were, I am afraid, equally selfish at\r\nheart. To read the biographies of both--I do not mean those that pretend\r\nto be historical--one would think that there had never been a grande\r\ndame on the stage of the Comédie-Française before Rachel or contemporary\r\nwith her, though Augustine Brohan was decidedly more grande dame than\r\nRachel in every respect. It is the same with regard to De Morny. To the\r\nchroniqueur during the Second Empire he was the only grand seigneur--the\r\nrest were only seigneurs; but I am inclined to think that the\r\nchroniqueur of those days had seen very few real grand seigneurs. To use\r\na popular locution, \"they did not go thirteen to the dozen\" at the court\r\nof Napoléon III.; and among the people with whom De Morny came\r\nhabitually in contact, in the course of his financial and industrial\r\nschemes, a grand seigneur was even a greater rarity than at the\r\nTuileries. If a kind of quiet impertinence to some of one's\r\nfellow-creatures, and a tacitly expressed contempt for nearly the whole\r\nof the rest, constitute the grand seigneur, then certainly De Morny\r\ncould have claimed the title. I have elsewhere noted the meeting of\r\nTaglioni with her husband at De Morny's dinner-party. If it had been\r\narranged by the host with the view of effecting a reconciliation between\r\nthe couple, then nothing could have been more praiseworthy; but I am not\r\nat all sure of it. If it were not, then it became an unpardonable joke\r\nat the woman's expense, and in the worst taste; but the chroniqueur of\r\nthose days would have applauded it all the same.\r\n\r\nHere are two stories which, at different times, were told by De Morny's\r\nfamiliars and sycophants in order to stamp him the grand seigneur. Late\r\nin the fifties he was an assiduous frequenter of the salons of a banker,\r\nwhose sisters-in-law happened to be very handsome. One evening, while\r\ntalking to one of them, they came to ask him to take a hand at\r\nlansquenet. He had evidently no intention of leaving the society of the\r\nlady for that of the gaming-table, and said so. Of course, his host was\r\nin the wrong in pressing the thing, nevertheless one has yet to learn\r\nthat \"two wrongs make one right.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you play?\" they asked, when they had as good as badgered him\r\naway from his companion.\r\n\r\n\"The simple rouge and the noir. That's the quickest.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten thousand francs.\"\r\n\r\nThe stake seemed somewhat high, and no one cared to take it up. But the\r\nhost himself felt bound to set the example, and the sum was made up. De\r\nMorny lost, and was about to rise from the table, when they said--\r\n\r\n\"Have your revenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; ten thousand on the black.\"\r\n\r\nHe lost again. Most grand seigneurs would have got up without saying\r\nanything. Twenty thousand francs was, after all, not an important sum to\r\nhim, and I feel, moreover, certain that it was not the loss of the money\r\nthat vexed him. But he felt bound to emphasize his indifference.\r\n\r\n\"There, that will do. I trust I shall be left in peace now.\"\r\n\r\nMy informant considered this exceedingly _talon rouge_; I did not.\r\n\r\nA story of a similar kind, when he was a simple deputy. A bigwig, with\r\nan inordinate ambition to become a minister, invited him to dinner. He\r\nhad been told that his host was in the habit of drinking a rare Bordeaux\r\nwhich was only offered to one or two guests, quietly pointed out by the\r\nformer to the servant. At the question of the latter whether he (M. de\r\nMorny) would take Brane-Mouton or Ermitage, he pointed to the famous\r\nbottle that had been hidden away. The servant, as badly trained as the\r\nmaster, looked embarrassed, but at last filled De Morny's glass with the\r\nprecious nectar. De Morny simply poured it into a tumbler and diluted it\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\nRidiculous as it may seem, De Morny often spoke and acted as if he had\r\nroyal blood in his veins, and in that respect scarcely considered\r\nhimself inferior to Colonna Walewski, of whose origin there could be no\r\ndoubt. A glance at the man's face was sufficient. Both frequently spoke\r\nand acted as if Louis-Napoléon occupied the Imperial throne by their\r\ngood will, and that, therefore, he was, in a measure, bound to dance to\r\ntheir fiddling. Outwardly these two were fast friends, up to a certain\r\nperiod; I fancy that their common hatred of De Persigny was the\r\nstrongest link of that bond. In reality they were as jealous of one\r\nanother and of their influence over the Emperor as they were of De\r\nPersigny and his. The latter, who was well aware of all this, frankly\r\naverred that he preferred Walewski's undisguised and outspoken hostility\r\nto De Morny's very questionable cordiality. \"The one would take my head\r\nlike Judith took Holofernes', the other would shave it like Delilah\r\nshaved Samson's, provided I trusted myself to either, which I am not\r\nlikely to do.\"\r\n\r\nIt was De Persigny who told me the substance of the following story, and\r\nI believe every word of it, because, first, I never caught De Persigny\r\ntelling a deliberate falsehood; secondly, because I heard it confirmed\r\nmany years afterwards in substance by two persons who were more or less\r\ndirectly concerned in it.\r\n\r\nIn the latter end of 1863 one of the sons of Baron James de Rothschild\r\ndied; I believe it was the youngest of the four, but I am not certain.\r\nThe old baron, who was generosity itself when it came to endowing\r\ncharitable institutions, was absolutely opposed to any waste of money.\r\nAmidst the terrible grief at his loss, he was still the careful\r\nadministrator, and sent to M. Émile Perrin, the then director of the\r\nGrand Opéra, and subsequently the director of the Comédie-Française,\r\nasking him to dispose of his box on the grand tier, under the express\r\ncondition that it should revert to him after a twelvemonth. It was the\r\nvery thing M. Perrin was not empowered to do. Though nominally the\r\ndirector, he was virtually the manager under Comte Bacciochi, the\r\nsuperintendent of the Imperial theatres; that is, the theatres which\r\nreceived a subsidy from the Emperor's civil list. The subscriber who\r\nwished to relinquish his box or seat, for however short a time--of\r\ncourse without continuing to pay for it--forfeited all subsequent claim\r\nto it. In this instance, though, apart from the position of Baron James,\r\nthe cause which prompted the application warranted an exception being\r\nmade; still M. Perrin did not wish to act upon his own responsibility,\r\nand referred the matter to Comte Bacciochi, telling him at the same time\r\nthat Comte Walewski would be glad to take the box during the interim.\r\nThe latter had but recently resigned the Ministry of State by reason of\r\nan unexpected difficulty in the \"Roman Question;\"[53] the ministerial\r\nbox went, as a matter of course, with the appointment, and Comte\r\nWalewski regretted the loss of the former, which was one of the best in\r\nthe house, more than the loss of the latter, and had asked his\r\nprotégé--M. Perrin owed his position at the Opéra to him--to get him as\r\ngood a one as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 53: If Comte Walewski ruled Napoléon III., the second\r\n         Comtesse Walewska, who was an Italian by birth and very\r\n         handsome, absolutely ruled her husband. The first Comtesse\r\n         Walewska was Lord Sandwich's daughter.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Comte Bacciochi had a grudge against Walewski for\r\nhaving questioned certain of his prerogatives connected with the\r\nsuperintendence of the Opéra. The moment he heard of Walewski's wish, he\r\nreplied, \"M. de Morny applied to me several months since for a better\r\nbox, and I see no reason why Comte Walewski should have it over his\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nVindictive like a Corsican, he laid the matter directly before the\r\nEmperor, and furthermore did his best to exasperate the two postulants\r\nagainst one another. De Morny had the box; Bacciochi had, however,\r\nsucceeded so well that the two men were for a considerable time not on\r\nspeaking terms.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Mexican question had assumed a very serious aspect. In\r\nspite of his undoubted interest in the Jecker scheme, or probably\r\nbecause it had yielded all it was likely to yield, De Morny had of late\r\nbeen on the side of Walewski, who strongly counselled the withdrawal of\r\nthe French troops. But the moment the incident of the opera-box cropped\r\nup, there was a change of front on his part. He became an ardent\r\npartisan for continuing the campaign, systematically siding against\r\nWalewski in everything, and tacitly avoiding any attempt of the latter\r\nto draw him into conversation. Walewski felt hurt, and gave up the\r\nattempt in despair. A little before this, Don Gutierrez de Estada had\r\nlanded in Europe with a deputation of notable Mexicans to offer the\r\ncrown to Maximilian. The latter made his acceptance conditional on the\r\ndespatch of twenty thousand French troops and the promise of a grant of\r\nthree hundred millions of francs.\r\n\r\nIn a council held at the Tuileries these conditions were unhesitatingly\r\ndeclined. \"That was, if I am not mistaken, on a Saturday,\" said De\r\nPersigny; \"and it was taken for granted that everything was settled. On\r\nMonday morning the council was hurriedly summoned to the Tuileries, and\r\nhaving to come from a good distance, Walewski arrived when it had been\r\nsitting for more than an hour. What had happened meanwhile? Simply this.\r\nDon Gutierrez had been informed of the decision of the Emperor's\r\nadvisers, and Maximilian had been communicated with by telegraph to the\r\nsame effect. On the Sunday morning the Archduke telegraphed to the\r\nMexican envoy that unless his conditions were subscribed to _in toto_ he\r\nshould decline the honour. Don Gutierrez, determined not to return\r\nwithout a king, rushed there and then to De Morny's and offered him the\r\ncrown. The latter immediately accepted, in the event of Maximilian\r\npersisting in his refusal. The Emperor was simply frantic with rage, but\r\nnothing would move De Morny. The only one who really had any influence\r\nover him was 'the other prince of the blood,' meaning Walewski, for,\r\naccording to him, the real and legitimate Bonapartes counted for\r\nnothing. Walewski was telegraphed for, as I told you, early in the\r\nmorning. When he came he found the council engaged in discussing the\r\nmeans of raising a loan. The Empress begged him to dissuade De Morny\r\nfrom his purpose, telling him all I have told you. Walewski refused to\r\nbe the first to speak to De Morny. I think that both Walewski and De\r\nMorny have heaped injury and insult upon me more than upon any man; I\r\nwould have obeyed the Empress for the Emperor's sake, but 'the two\r\nprinces of the blood' only consulted their own dignity. I need not tell\r\nyou what effect the elevation of De Morny to the throne of Mexico would\r\nhave produced in Europe, let alone in France. Rather than risk such a\r\nthing, the money was found; Bazaine was sent, and that poor fellow,\r\nMaximilian, went to his death, because M. Bacciochi had sown dissension\r\nbetween the brother and the cousin of the Emperor about an opera-box.\r\nSuch is history, my friend.\"\r\n\r\nI repeat, De Persigny was a better man at heart than De Morny, or\r\nperhaps than Walewski, though the latter had only fads, and never\r\nstooped to the questionable practices of his fellow \"prince of the\r\nblood\" in the race for wealth. The erstwhile sergeant-quartermaster\r\nrefrained from doing so out of sheer contempt for money-hunters, and\r\nfrom an inborn feeling of honesty. The son of Napoléon I., though\r\nillegitimate, felt what was due to the author of his being, and\r\nabsolutely refused to be mixed up with any commercial transactions. He\r\nwas never quietly insolent to any one, like the natural son of Hortense;\r\nhe rarely said either a foolish or a wise thing, but frequently did\r\nill-considered ones, as, for instance, when he wrote a play. \"What\r\ninduced you to do this, monsieur le comte?\" said Thiers, on the first\r\nnight. \"It is so difficult to write a play in five acts, and it is so\r\neasy not to write a play in five acts.\" Among his fads was the objection\r\nto ladies in the stalls of a theatre. In 1861 he issued an order\r\nforbidding their admission to that part of the house, and could only be\r\npersuaded with difficulty, and at the eleventh hour, to rescind it. In\r\nmany respects he was like Philip II. of Spain; he worried about trifles.\r\nOne day he prevailed upon M. de Boitelle, the Prefect of police, a\r\nthoroughly sensible man, to put a stop to the flying of kites, because\r\ntheir tails might get entangled in the telegraph wires, and cause damage\r\nto the latter. I happened to meet him on the Boulevards on the very day\r\nthe edict was promulgated. He felt evidently very proud of the\r\nconception, and asked me what I thought of it. I told him the story of\r\n\"the cow on the rails,\" according to Stephenson. Napoléon, when he heard\r\nof Walewski's reform, sent for Boitelle. \"Here is an 'order in council'\r\nI want you to publish,\" he said, as seriously as possible. It was to the\r\neffect that \"all birds found perching on the wires would be fined, and,\r\nin default of payment, imprisoned.\" Curiously enough, though a man of\r\nparts, and naturally intelligent, satire of that kind was lost upon him,\r\nfor not very long after he prevailed upon M. de Boitelle to revive an\r\nobsolete order with regard to the length of the hackney-drivers' whips\r\nand the cracking thereof. It was M. Carlier, the predecessor of M. de\r\nMaupas, who had originally attempted a similar thing. He was rewarded\r\nwith a pictorial skit representing him on the point of drowning, while\r\ncabby was trying to save him by holding out his whip, which proved too\r\nshort for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWalewski had none of the vivacity of most of the Bonapartes. I knew him\r\na good many years before, and after the establishment of the Second\r\nEmpire, and have rarely seen him out of temper. I fancy he must have\r\nmade an admirable ambassador with a good chief at his back; he, himself,\r\nI think, had little spirit of initiative, though, like a good many of\r\nus, he was fully convinced of the contrary. He was, to use the correct\r\nword, frequently dull; nevertheless, it was currently asserted and\r\nbelieved that he was the only man Rachel ever sincerely cared for. \"Je\r\ncomprends cela,\" said George Sand one day, when the matter was discussed\r\nin her presence; \"son commerce doit lui reposer l'esprit.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that during the reign which succeeded that of\r\nLouis-Philippe, the man who wielded the greatest power next to the\r\nEmperor was, in almost every respect but one, the mental and moral\r\ncounterpart of \"the citizen king.\" I am alluding to M. Eugène Rouher,\r\nsometimes called the vice-emperor.[54] I knew Eugène Rouher some years\r\nbefore he was thought of as a deputy, let alone as a minister--when, in\r\nfact, he was terminating his law courses in the Quartier-Latin; but not\r\neven the most inveterate Pumblechook would have dared to advance\r\nafterwards that he perceived the germs of his future eminence in him\r\nthen. He was a good-looking young fellow, in no way distinguished from\r\nthe rest. He was a not unworthy ornament of \"La Chaumière,\" and did\r\nprobably as much or as little poring over books as his companions.\r\nStill, there could be no doubt as to his natural intelligence, but the\r\ndunces in my immediate circle were very few. He was not very well off;\r\nbut, as I have said elsewhere, the Croesuses were also rare. At any\r\nrate, Eugène Rouher had entirely passed out of my recollection, and\r\nwhen, eleven or twelve years later, I saw his name in the list of Odilon\r\nBarrot's administration as Minister of Justice, I had not the remotest\r\nidea that it was the Eugène Rouher of my Quartier-Latin days. I am\r\ncertain that a great many of our former acquaintances were equally\r\nignorant, because, though I met several of them from time to time on the\r\n\"fashionable side\" of the Seine, I do not remember a single one having\r\ndrawn my attention to him. It was only at one of the presidential\r\nreceptions at the Élysée, in 1850, that I became aware of the fact. He\r\ncame up to me and held out his hand. \"Il me semble, monsieur, que nous\r\nnous sommes déjà rencontrés au Quartier-Latin,\" he said. Even then I was\r\nin the dark with regard to the position he was fast assuming; but the\r\nPrince-President himself enlightened me to a great extent in the course\r\nof the evening. \"It appears that you and Rouher are old acquaintances,\"\r\nhe said in English; and on my nodding in the affirmative, he added, \"If\r\nyou were a Frenchman, and inclined to go in for politics, or even an\r\nEnglishman in need of patronage or influence, I would advise you to\r\nstick to him, for he is a very remarkable man, and I fancy we shall hear\r\na good deal of him within the next few years.\" I may, therefore, say\r\nwithout exaggeration that I was one of the first who had a trustworthy\r\ntip with regard to a comparatively \"dark political horse,\" and from a\r\ntipster in whom by that time I was inclined to believe.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 54: It is equally curious to note, perhaps, that M.\r\n         Grévy, who occupied the presidential chair of the Third\r\n         Republic for a longer period than his two predecessors, was in\r\n         many respects like Louis-Philippe, notably in his love of\r\n         money.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThough I was neither \"a Frenchman inclined to go in for politics,\" nor\r\n\"even an Englishman in need of patronage or influence,\" my curiosity had\r\nbeen aroused; for, I repeat, at the time of our first acquaintance I had\r\nconsidered Eugène Rouher a fairly intelligent young fellow; but his\r\nintelligence had not struck me as likely to make a mark, at any rate so\r\nsoon, seeing that he was considerably below forty when I met him at the\r\nÉlysée. It is idle to assert, as the republicans have done since, that\r\nhe gained his position by abandoning the political professions to which\r\nhe owed his start in public life. Among the nine hundred deputies of the\r\nSecond Republic, there were at least a hundred intelligent so-called\r\nrepublicans ready and willing to do the same with the prospect of a far\r\nless signal reward than fell eventually to Rouher's lot.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity was doomed to remain unsatisfied until two or three years\r\nlater, when Rouher had already become a fixture in the political\r\norganization of the Empire. It was De Morny himself who gave me the\r\nparticulars of Rouher's beginnings, and I have no reason to suppose that\r\nhe painted them and the man in deliberately glowing colours, albeit that\r\nin one important crisis they acted in concert. Clermont-Ferrand was only\r\nabout twelve miles from Riom, Rouher's native town. I have already\r\nremarked that De Morny, at the time he met with his brother for the\r\nfirst time, was at the head of an important industrial establishment. It\r\nwas at the former place; De Morny, therefore, was in a position to know.\r\n\r\nEugène Rouher, it appears, like a good many men who have risen to\r\npolitical eminence, belonged to what, for want of a better term, I may\r\ncall the rural bourgeoisie--that is, the frugal, thrifty, hard-headed,\r\nsmall landowner, tilling his own land, honest in the main, ever on the\r\nalert to increase his own property by a timely bargain, with an intense\r\nlove of the soil, with a kind of semi-Voltairean contempt for the\r\nclergy, an ingrained respect largely admixed with fear for \"the man of\r\nthe law,\" to which profession he often brings up his son in order to\r\nhave what he likes most--litigation--for nothing. Rouher's grandfather\r\nwas a man of that stamp; he made an attorney of his son, and the latter\r\nestablished himself in the Rue Desaix, in a small, one-storied,\r\nuninviting-looking tenement, where, in the year 1814, Eugène Rouher was\r\nborn.[55] Rouher's father was not very prosperous, yet he managed to\r\nsend both his sons to Paris to study law. The elder son, much older than\r\nthe future minister, had succeeded in getting a very good practice at\r\nthe Riom bar, but he died a short time before Eugène returned from\r\nParis, leaving a widow and a son, who, of course, was too young to take\r\nhis father's place. The young barrister, therefore, stepped into a\r\ncapital ready-made practice, and being exceedingly amiable, bright,\r\nhard-working, and essentially honest, soon made a host of friends.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 55: Before that it bore the name of the Rue des\r\n         Trois-Hautbois, and in the heyday of the Second Empire it was\r\n         changed into the Rue Eugène-Rouher. But at the fall of Sedan\r\n         the indignation against the Emperor's powerful minister was so\r\n         great that his carriages had to be removed from Riom lest they\r\n         should be burned by the mob, and the street resumed its old\r\n         appellation. In November, 1887, three years after Rouher's\r\n         death, I happened to be at Clermont-Ferrand waiting for General\r\n         Boulanger to go to Paris. I went over to Riom and had a look at\r\n         the house. It was occupied by a carpenter or joiner, to whose\r\n         father it had been sold years previously by the express wish of\r\n         one of Eugène Rouher's daughters. I got into conversation with\r\n         an intelligent inhabitant of the town, who told me that on the\r\n         4th of September, 1870, the feeling against Rouher was much\r\n         stronger than against Louis-Napoléon himself, yet that feeling\r\n         was an implied compliment to Rouher. \"He was the cleverer of\r\n         the two,\" the people shouted; \"he ought not to have allowed the\r\n         Emperor to engage in this war. He could have prevented it with\r\n         one word.\" Nevertheless, in a little while it abated, and\r\n         Rouher was elected a member of the National Assembly.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"I have frequently found myself opposed to Rouher,\" said De Morny; \"but\r\nhis unswerving loyalty to the Empire and the Emperor is beyond question.\r\nI should not wonder but what he died poor.[56]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 56: De Morny's prophecy turned out correct. M. Eugène\r\n         Rouher died a poor man. There is a comic story connected with\r\n         this poverty. At the beginning of the Republic, and during the\r\n         presidency of Thiers, Rouher's house was constantly watched by\r\n         detectives. The weather was abominably bad; it rained\r\n         constantly. Madame Rouher sent them some cotton umbrellas,\r\n         excusing herself for not sending silk ones, because she could\r\n         not afford it.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"As you know, Eugène Rouher was really very handsome. Mdlle.\r\nConchon--that is Madame Rouher's maiden name--thought him the handsomest\r\nman in the world. True, her world did not extend beyond a few miles from\r\nClermont-Ferrand; but I fancy she might have gone further and fared\r\nworse. You know old Conchon, and the pride he takes in his son-in-law.\r\nWell, he would not hear of the marriage at first. Conchon was a\r\ncharacter in those days. Though he had but a poor practice at the\r\nClermont bar, he was clever; and if he had gone to Paris as a\r\njournalist, instead of vegetating down there, I am sure he would have\r\nmade his way. He was very fond of his classics--of Horace and Tibullus\r\nabove all--and turned out some pretty Anacreontic verses for the local\r\n'caveau;' for Clermont, like every other provincial centre, prided\r\nitself on its 'caveau.'[57]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 57: The diminutive of \"cave\" (cellar). Really a\r\n         gathering of poets and songwriters, which reached its highest\r\n         reputation in Paris during the early part of the present\r\n         century. The Saturday nights at the Savage Club are perhaps the\r\n         nearest approach to it in London.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"A time came, however, when Conchon's fortunes took a turn for the\r\nbetter. You can form no idea of the political ignorance that prevailed\r\nin the provinces even as late as the reign of Louis-Philippe. Any\r\nmeasure advocated or promulgated by the Government was sure to be\r\nreceived with suspicion by the populations as affecting their liberties,\r\nand, what was of still greater consequence to them, their property. The\r\nFirst Republic had given them license to despoil others; any subsequent\r\nmeasure of the monarchies was looked upon by them as an attempt at\r\nreprisal. In 1842 a general census was ordered. You may remember the\r\nhostility it provoked in Paris; it was nothing to its effect in the\r\nagricultural and wine-growing centres. The Republican wire-pullers\r\nspread the report that the census meant nothing but the thin end of the\r\nwedge of a bill for the duties upon wine to be paid by the grower. There\r\nwas a terrible row in Clermont-Ferrand and the neighbourhood; the\r\n'Marseillaise' had to make way for the still more revolutionary\r\n'Ça-ira.' Conchon was maire of Clermont-Ferrand, and he who was as\r\ninnocent of all this as a new-born babe, had his house burned over his\r\nhead. The Government argued that if the mob had burned the maire's\r\ndwelling in preference to that of the prefect, it was because the former\r\nwas a more influential personage than the latter; for there could be no\r\nother reason for their giving him the 'Legion of Honour,' and appointing\r\nhim to a puisne judgeship on the bench of Riom, seeing that he had\r\nneither made an heroic defence of his property, nor endeavoured to carry\r\nout the provisions of the census bill by armed force. In fact, the\r\nlatter step would have been an impossibility on Conchon's part. You and\r\nI know well enough how difficult it is to make Frenchmen hold their\r\ntongues by means of troops; to endeavour to make them speak--in\r\ndistinction to yelling--by similar means is altogether out of the\r\nquestion. You cannot take every head of a family, even in a\r\ncomparatively small town like Clermont-Ferrand, and put him between two\r\ngendarmes to make him tell you his name, his age, and those of his\r\nfamily. I fancy, moreover, that Conchon was not at Clermont at all when\r\nthe mob made a bonfire of his dwelling; it was on a Sunday, and he had\r\nprobably gone into the country. At any rate, as I told you, they gave\r\nhim the cross and a judgeship. It never rains but it pours. Contrary to\r\nthe ordinary principles of French mobs of hating a man in proportion to\r\nhis standing well with the Government, they started a subscription to\r\nindemnify Conchon for the loss of his house, which subscription amounted\r\nto a hundred thousand francs.\r\n\r\n\"Conchon had become a somebody, and refused to give his daughter to a\r\nmere provincial barrister now that he belonged to 'la magistrature\r\nassise.'[58] The young people were, however, very fond of one another,\r\nand had their way. They were a very handsome couple, and became the life\r\nand soul of the best society of Clermont-Ferrand, which, exclusive as it\r\nwas, admitted them as they had admitted the widow of the elder brother.\r\nThe younger Madame Rouher was by no means as sprightly or as clever as\r\nshe has become since. She was somewhat of a spoilt child, but her\r\nhusband was a very brilliant talker indeed, though, unlike many\r\nbrilliant talkers, there was not an ounce of spite in his cleverest\r\nremarks. The electors might have done worse than send him to Paris the\r\nfirst time he invited their suffrages in '46, under the auspices of\r\nGuizot. Nevertheless, he was beaten by a goodly majority, and he had to\r\nwait until after the Revolution of February, when he was returned on the\r\nRepublican list.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 58: The term for the French bench, consisting of\r\n         judges; the _parquet_, _i. e._ those to whom the public\r\n         prosecution is confided, are called \"la magistrature debout.\"\r\n         As a rule, the latter have a great deal more talent than the\r\n         former. \"What are you going to do with your son?\" asked a\r\n         gentleman of his friend. \"I am going to make a magistrate of\r\n         him--'debout,' if he is strong enough to keep on his legs;\r\n         'assis,' if he be not.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nSo far De Morny. Consulting my personal recollections of Eugène Rouher,\r\nwhom I still see now and then, I find nothing but good to say of him. I\r\nam not prepared to judge him as a politician, that kind of judgment\r\nbeing utterly at variance with the spirit of these notes, but I know of\r\nno French statesman whose memory will be entitled to greater respect\r\nthan Rouher's, with the exception, perhaps, of Guizot's. Both men\r\ncommitted grave faults, but no feeling of self-interest actuated them.\r\nThe world is apt to blame great ministers for clinging to power after\r\nthey have apparently given the greatest measure of their genius. They do\r\nnot blame Harvey and Jenner for having continued to study and to\r\npractise after they had satisfactorily demonstrated, the one the theory\r\nof the circulation of the blood, the other the possibility of\r\ninoculation against small-pox; they do not blame Milton for having\r\ncontinued to write after he had given \"Paradise Lost,\" Rubens for having\r\ncontinued to paint after he had given \"The Descent from the Cross,\"\r\nMichael-Angelo for not having abandoned the sculptor's chisel after he\r\nhad finished the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The bold stroke of\r\npolicy that made England a principal shareholder in the Suez Canal, the\r\nMenai Bridge, the building of the Great Western Railway, were\r\nachievements of great men who had apparently given all there was in\r\nthem to give; why should Rouher have retired when he was barely fifty,\r\nand not have endeavoured to retrieve the mistake he evidently made when\r\nhe allowed Bismarck to humiliate Austria at Sadowa, and to lay the\r\nfoundations of a unified Germany? Richelieu made mistakes also, but he\r\nretrieved them before his death.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, Rouher was both in public and private life an\r\nessentially honourable and honest man--as honest as Louis-Philippe in\r\nmany respects, far more honest in others, and absolutely free from the\r\neverlasting preoccupation about money which marred that monarch's\r\ncharacter. He was as disinterested as Guizot, and would have scorned the\r\ntergiversations and hypocrisy of Thiers. He never betrayed his master's\r\ncause; he never consciously sacrificed his country to his pride. The\r\nonly blame that can be laid to his charge is that he allowed his better\r\nsense to be overruled by a woman; but that woman was the wife of his\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nHe was, above all, a staunch friend to those who had known him in his\r\nearly days. \"There will be no Auvergnats left in Clermont-Ferrand and\r\nRiom if this goes on,\" said a witty journalist, seeing Rouher constantly\r\nsurrounded by the natives of that particular province, to the exclusion\r\nof every one else. \"We'll send an equal quantity of Parisians to\r\nAuvergne; it will do them good, and teach them to work,\" replied Rouher,\r\nwhen he heard of the remark. \"And in another generation or two Paris\r\nwill see what it has never seen before, namely, frugal Parisians, doing\r\na day's labour for a day's wage, for we'll have their offspring back by\r\nthen.\" For Rouher could be very witty when he liked, and never feared to\r\nhit out straight. He was a delightful talker, and, next to Alexandre\r\nDumas, the best raconteur I have ever met. It was because he had a\r\nmarvellous memory and a distinct talent for mimicry. Owing to this\r\nlatter gift, he was unlike any other parliamentary orator I have ever\r\nheard. He would sit perfectly still under the most terrible onslaught of\r\nhis opponents, whoever they were. No sign of impatience or weariness,\r\nnot an attempt to take a note; his eyes remained steadily fixed on his\r\ninterlocutor, his arms folded across his chest. Then he would rise\r\nslowly from his seat and walk to the tribune, when there was one, take\r\nup the argument of his adversary, not only word for word, but with the\r\nlatter's intonation and gestures, almost with the latter's voice--which\r\nused to drive Thiers wild--and answer it point by point.\r\n\r\nHe used to call that \"fair debating;\" in reality, it was the masterly\r\ntrick of a great actor, who mercilessly wielded his power of ridicule;\r\nbut we must remember that he had originally been a lawyer, and that the\r\nscent of the French law-courts hung over him till the very end. \"I am\r\nnot always convinced of the honesty of my cause, but I hold a brief for\r\nthe Government, and I feel convinced that it would not be honest to let\r\nthe other party get the victory,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe was, and remained, very simple in his habits. He would not have\r\nminded entertaining his familiars every night of the week, but he did\r\nnot care for the grand receptions he was compelled to give. He was very\r\nfond of the game of piquet. His father-in-law, who had been promoted to\r\na judgeship in one of the Paris courts, had been a foeman worthy of his\r\nsteel; \"but I am afraid,\" laughed Rouher, \"that his exaggerated\r\nadmiration for me affects his play.\"\r\n\r\nRouher was right; M. Conchon was inordinately proud of his son-in-law.\r\nHe lived, as it were, in the Minister of State's reflected glory. His\r\ngreat delight was to go shopping, in order to have the satisfaction of\r\nsaying to the tradesmen, \"You'll have this sent to my son-in-law, M.\r\nRouher.\" The stir and bustle of the Paris streets confused him to the\r\nlast, but he did not mind it, seeing that it afforded him an opportunity\r\nof inquiring his way. \"I want to get back to the Ministry of State--to\r\nmy son-in-law, M. Rouher.\" It was not snobbishness; it was sheer\r\nunadulterated admiration of the man to whom he had somewhat reluctantly\r\ngiven his daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n     Society during the Second Empire -- The Court at Compiègne -- The\r\n     English element -- Their opinion of Louis-Napoléon -- The\r\n     difference between the court of Louis-Philippe and that of\r\n     Napoléon III. -- The luggage of M.

I\r\ndoubt whether, besides Lord H---- and myself, there was a single English\r\nguest there who went for the mere pleasure of going. Lords Palmerston,\r\nCowley, and Clarendon, and a good many others whom I could name, had\r\neither political or private ends to serve. They all looked upon Napoléon\r\nIII. as an adventurer, but an adventurer whom they might use for their\r\nown purpose. I am afraid that the same charge might be preferred against\r\npersons in even a more exalted station. Prince Albert averred that\r\nNapoléon III. had sold his soul to the devil; Lord Cowley, on being\r\nasked by a lady whether the Emperor talked much, replied, \"No, but he\r\nalways lies.\" Another diplomatist opined \"that Napoléon lied so well,\r\nthat one could not even believe the contrary of what he said.\"\r\n\r\nEnough. I went to the Compiègne of Napoléon III., just as I had gone to\r\nthe Compiègne of the latter years of Louis-Philippe--simply to enjoy\r\nmyself; with this difference, however,--that I enjoyed myself much\r\nbetter at the former than at the latter. Louis-Philippe's hospitality\r\nwas very genuine, homely, and unpretending, but it lacked\r\nexcitement--especially for a young man of my age. The entertainments\r\nwere more in harmony with the tastes of the Guizots, Cousins, and\r\nVillemains, who went down en redingote, and took little else; especially\r\nthe eminent professor and minister of public education, whose luggage\r\nconsisted of a brown paper parcel, containing a razor, a clean collar,\r\nand the cordon of the Legion of Honour. There were some excellent hunts,\r\norganized by the Grand Veneur, the Comte de Girardin, and the Chief\r\nRanger, the Baron de Larminat; but the evenings, notwithstanding the new\r\ntheatre built by Louis-Philippe, were frightfully dull, and barely\r\ncompensated for by the reviews at the camp of Compiègne, to which the\r\nKing conducted his Queen and the princesses in a tapissière and four, he\r\nhimself driving, the Duc and Duchesse de Montpensier occupying the box\r\nseat, the rest of the family ensconced in the carriage, \"absolument en\r\nbons bourgeois.\" With the advent of Louis-Napoléon, even before he\r\nassumed the imperial purple, a spirit of change came over the place.\r\nHortense's second son would probably have made a better poet than an\r\nemperor. His whole life has been a miscarried poem, miscarried by the\r\ninexorable demands of European politics. He dreamt of being\r\nL'Empereur-Soleil, as Louis XIV. had been Le Roi-Soleil. Visions of a\r\nnineteenth-century La Vallière or Montespan, hanging fondly on his arm,\r\nand dispelling the harassing cares of State by sweet smiles while\r\ntreading the cool umbrageous glades of the magnificent park, haunted his\r\nbrain. He would have gone as far as Louis le Bien-Aimé, and built\r\nanother nest for another Pompadour. He did not mean to make a Maintenon\r\nout of a Veuve Scarron, and, least of all, an empress out of a\r\nMademoiselle Eugénie de Montijo. Mdlle. de Montijo, on the other hand,\r\nwas determined not to be a Mdme. de Maintenon, let alone a La Vallière\r\nor a Pompadour. At any rate, so she said, and the man most interested in\r\nputting her assertion to the test was too infatuated to do so. \"Quand on\r\nne s'attend à rien, la moindre des choses surprend.\" The proverb holds\r\ngood, more especially where a woman's resistance is concerned. Mdlle. de\r\nMontijo was a Spaniard, or at least half a one, and that half contained\r\nas much superstition as would have fitted out a score of her\r\ncountrywomen of unmixed blood. One day in Granada, while she was sitting\r\nat her window, a gipsy, whose hand \"she had crossed with silver,\" is\r\nsaid to have foretold her that she should be queen. The young girl\r\nprobably attached but little importance to the words at that time;\r\n\"but,\" said my informant, \"from the moment Louis-Napoléon breathed the\r\nfirst protestations of love to her, the prophecy recurred to her in all\r\nits vividness, and she made up her mind that the right hand and not the\r\nleft of Louis-Napoléon should set the seal upon its fulfilment.\" My\r\ninformant was an Englishman, very highly placed, and distinctly _au\r\ncourant_ of the private history of the Marquise de Montijo y Teba, as\r\nwell as that of her mother. Without the least fear of being\r\ncontradicted, I may say that the subsequent visit of Queen Victoria and\r\nPrince Albert was due to his direct influence. I will not go as far as\r\nto assert that Louis-Napoléon's participation in the Crimean war could\r\nnot have been had at that moment at any other price, or that England\r\ncould not have dispensed with that co-operation, but he, my informant,\r\nconsidered then that the alliance would be more closely cemented by that\r\nvisit. Nor am I called upon to anticipate the final verdict of the\r\nsocial historian with regard to \"that act of courtesy\" on the part of\r\nthe Queen of England, not the least justified boast of whose reign it is\r\nthat she purified the morals of her court by her own example. Still, one\r\nmay safely assume, in this instance, that the virtue of Mdlle. de\r\nMontijo would have been proof against the \"blandishments of the future\r\nEmperor,\" even if she had not had the advice and countenance of her\r\nmother, whose Scotch blood would not have stood trifling with her\r\ndaughter's affections and reputation. But to make the fortress of that\r\nheart doubly impregnable, the Comtesse de Montijo scarcely ever left her\r\nsecond daughter's side. It was a great sacrifice on her part, because\r\nMdlle. Eugénie de Montijo was not her favourite child; that position was\r\noccupied by her elder, the Duchesse d'Albe. \"Mais, on est mère, ou on ne\r\nl'est pas?\" says Madame Cardinal.[59]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 59: The author alludes to the Madame Cardinal of\r\n         Ludovic Halévy, who sequestrates her daughter because the\r\n         baron, her would-be protector, is hanging back with the\r\n         settlements.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nMdlle. de Montijo, then, became the guiding spirit of the fêtes at the\r\nÉlysée. She and her mother had travelled a great deal, so had\r\nLouis-Napoléon; the latter not enough, apparently, to have learnt the\r\nwisdom of the French proverb, \"Gare à la femme dont le berceau a été une\r\nmalle, et le pensionnat une table d'hôte.\"\r\n\r\nI have spoken elsewhere of the Coup d'État and of the company at the\r\nÉlysée, immediately previous to it and afterwards; early in 1852--\r\n\r\n  \"The little done _did_ vanish to the mind,\r\n   Which forward _saw_ how much remained to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince-President undertook a journey to the southern parts of\r\nFrance, which he was pleased to call \"an interrogation to the country.\"\r\nIt was that to a certain extent, only the country had been crammed with\r\none reply to it, \"Vive l'empereur.\" Calmly reviewing things from a\r\ndistance of a quarter of a century, it was the best reply the nation\r\ncould have made. \"Society has been too long like a pyramid turned upside\r\ndown. I replaced it on its base,\" said Louis-Napoléon, on the 29th of\r\nMarch, 1852, when he opened the first session of the Chambers, and\r\ninaugurated the new constitution which was his own work. \"He is right,\"\r\nremarked one of his female critics, \"and now we are going to dance on\r\nthe top of it. À quand les invitations?\"\r\n\r\nThe invitations were issued almost immediately after the journey just\r\nmentioned, and before the plébiscite had given the Prince-President the\r\nImperial crown. One of the first was for a series of fêtes at Compiègne.\r\nThe château was got ready in hot haste; but, of course, the \"hunts\" were\r\nnot half so splendid as they became afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe most observed of all the guests was Mdlle. de Montijo, accompanied\r\nby her mother, but no one suspected for a single moment that the\r\nhandsome Spanish girl who was galloping by Louis-Napoléon's side would\r\nbe in a few months Empress of the French. Only a few knowing ones\r\noffered to back her for the Imperial Stakes at any odds; I took them,\r\nand, of course, lost heavily. This is not a figure of speech, but a\r\nliteral fact. There were, however, no quotations \"for a place,\" backers\r\nand bookies alike being agreed that she would be first or nowhere in the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nHow it would have fared with the favourite had there been any other\r\nentries, it would be difficult to say, but there were none; the various\r\nEuropean sovereigns declined the honour of an alliance with the house\r\nof Bonaparte, so Mdlle. Eugénie de Montijo simply walked over the\r\ncourse. One evening the rumour spread that Louis-Napoléon had uttered\r\nthe magic word \"marriage,\" in consequence of a violent fit of coughing\r\nwhich had choked the word \"mistress\" down his throat. Not to mince\r\nmatters, the affair happened in this way, and I speak on excellent\r\nauthority. The day before, there had been a hunt, and between the return\r\nfrom the forest and the dinner-hour, Napoléon had presented himself\r\nunannounced in Mdlle. de Montijo's apartment. Neither I nor the others\r\nwho were at the château at the time could satisfactorily account for the\r\nprologue to this visit, but that there was such a prologue, and that it\r\nwas conceived and enacted by at least two out of the three actors in the\r\nbest spirit of the \"comédie d'intrigue,\" so dear to the heart of Scribe,\r\nadmits of no doubt; because, though the first dinner-bell had already\r\nrung, Mdlle. de Montijo was still in her riding-habit, consequently on\r\nthe alert. Nay, even her dainty hunting-crop was within her reach, as\r\nthe intruder found to his cost; and reports were rife to the effect\r\nthat, if the one had failed, the mother, who was in the next room, would\r\nhave come to the rescue of her injured daughter.\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse de Montijo was spared this act of heroism; Lucrece herself\r\nsufficed for the task of defending her own honour: nevertheless, the\r\nmother's part was not at an end, even when the decisive word had been\r\npronounced. According to her daughter, she objected to the union, from a\r\nsincere regard for her would-be-son-in-law, from an all-absorbing love\r\nfor her own darling. The social gulf between the two was too wide ever\r\nto be bridged, etc. \"And though it will break my heart to have to obey\r\nher, I have no alternative,\" added Mdlle. de Montijo, if not in these\r\nselfsame words, at least in words to that effect. \"There remains but one\r\nhope. Write to her.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Louis-Napoléon did write. The letter has been religiously preserved\r\nby the Montijo family. In less than three mouths afterwards France was\r\nofficially or semi-officially apprised of the Emperor's intended union;\r\nbut, of course, the news had spread long before then, and a very varied\r\neffect it produced. Candidly speaking, it satisfied no one, and every\r\none delivered judgment in two separate, if not different, capacities--as\r\nprivate citizens and as patriotic Frenchmen. The lower classes,\r\ncontaining the ultra-democratic element, would have perhaps applauded\r\nthe bold departure from the old traditions that had hitherto presided at\r\nsovereign unions, if the bride had been French, instead of being a\r\nforeigner. They were sensible enough not to expect their new Emperor to\r\nchoose from the bourgeoisie; but, in spite of their prejudices against\r\nthe old noblesse, they would, in default of a princess of royal blood,\r\nhave liked to see one of that noblesse's daughters share the Imperial\r\nthrone. They were not deceived by Napoléon's specious argument that\r\nFrance had better assume openly the position of a parvenu rather than\r\nmake the new principle of the unrestricted suffrage of a great nation\r\npass for an old one by trying to introduce herself at any cost into a\r\nfamily of kings.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie itself was more disgusted still. Incredible as it may\r\nseem, they did resent Napoléon's slight of their daughters. \"A défaut\r\nd'une princesse de sang royal, une de nos filles eut fait aussi bien\r\nqu'une étrangère, dont le grand père, après tout, était négociant comme\r\nnous. Le premier empire a été fait avec le sang de garçons d'écurie, de\r\ntonnelliers; le second empire aurait pu prendre un pen de ce sang sans\r\nse mésallier.\" The bourgeois Voltairien was more biting in his sarcasm.\r\nIn his speech to the grand officers of State and corporations, Napoléon\r\nhad alluded to Empress Joséphine: \"France has not forgotten that for the\r\nlast seventy years foreign princesses have only ascended the steps of\r\nthe throne to see their race scattered and proscribed, either by war or\r\nrevolution. One woman alone appears to have brought the people better\r\nluck, and to have left a more lasting impression on their memory, and\r\nthat woman, the modest and kindly wife of General Bonaparte, was not\r\ndescended from royal blood.\" Then, speaking of the empress that was to\r\nbe, he concluded, \"A good and pious Catholic, she will, like myself,\r\noffer up the same prayers for the welfare and happiness of France; I\r\ncherish the firm hope that, gracious and kind as she is, she will, while\r\noccupying a similar position, revive once more the virtues of\r\nJoséphine.\" All of which references to the undoubtedly skittish widow of\r\nGeneral de Beauharnais made the satirically inclined bourgeois, who knew\r\nthe chronique scandaleuse of the Directoire quite as well as\r\nLouis-Napoléon, sneer. Said one, \"It is a strange present to put into a\r\ngirl's trousseau, the virtues of Joséphine; the Nessus-shirt given to\r\nHercules was nothing to it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Faubourg St.-Germain made common cause for once with the Orleanists\r\nsalons, which were avenging the confiscation of the princes' property;\r\nand both, if less brutal than the speaker just quoted, were not less\r\ncruel. The daughter had to bear the brunt of the mother's reputation.\r\nPublic securities went down two francs at the announcement of the\r\nmarriage. There was but one man who stood steadfast by the Emperor and\r\nhis bride, Dupin the elder; but his ironical defence of the choice was\r\nnearly as bad as his opposition to it could have been. \"People care very\r\nlittle as to what I say and think, and perhaps they are right,\" he\r\nremarked; \"but still, the Emperor acts more sensibly by marrying the\r\nwoman he likes than by eating humble-pie and bargaining for some\r\nstrait-laced, stuck-up German princess, with feet as large as mine. At\r\nany rate, when he kisses his wife, it will be because he feels inclined,\r\nand not because he feels compelled.\"[60]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 60: Dupin's feet were enormous, and, furthermore,\r\n         invariably shod in thick, hobnailed bluchers. He himself was\r\n         always jestingly alluding to them; and one day, on the occasion\r\n         of a funeral of a friend, which he could not possibly attend,\r\n         he suggested sending his boots instead. \"People send their\r\n         empty conveyance: I'll send mine,\" he said.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, amidst all this flouting and jeering, the Emperor and his\r\nfuture consort felt very uncomfortable, but they showed a brave front.\r\nHe inferred, rather than said to one and all who advanced objections,\r\nthat his love for Mdlle. de Montijo was not the sole motive for his\r\ncontemplated union. He wished to induce them into the belief that\r\npolitical motives were not foreign to it--that he was, as it were,\r\nflinging the gauntlet to monarchical Europe, which, not content with\r\nrefusing him a wife, was determined to throw a spoke in his matrimonial\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he and his bride felt that they could not altogether\r\ndispense with the pomp and circumstance of courts. Like his uncle,\r\nNapoléon III. was exceedingly fond of grand ceremonial display, and he\r\nset his heart upon his Empress having a brilliant escort of fair and\r\nillustrious women on the day of her nuptials. To seek for such an escort\r\namong the grandes dames of the old noblesse would, he knew, be so much\r\nwaste of time; but he was justified in the hope that the descendants of\r\nthose who owed some of their titles and most of their fortunes to his\r\nuncle would prove more amenable. In this he was mistaken: both the\r\nDuchesse de Vicence and the Duchesse des Lesparres, besides several\r\nothers to whom the highest positions in the Empress's household were\r\noffered, declined the honour. The Duc de Bassano did worse. Much as the\r\nDe Caulaincourts and the De Lesparres owed to the son of the Corsican\r\nlawyer, the Marets owed him infinitely more. Yet their descendant, but a\r\nfew days before the marriage, went about repeating everywhere that he\r\nabsolutely objected to see his wife figure in the suite of the daughter\r\nof the Comtesse de Montijo, \"who\" (the daughter) \"was a little too much\r\nof a posthumous child.\" He not only relented with regard to the duchesse\r\nat the eleventh hour, but accepted the office of Grand Chambellan, which\r\noffice he filled to the end of his life.\r\n\r\nIn fact, honours and titles went absolutely a-begging in those days. Let\r\nme not be misunderstood. There were plenty of men and women ready to\r\naccept both, and to deck out their besmirched, though very authentic,\r\nscutcheons with them; but of these the Empress, at any rate, would have\r\nnone. She would have willingly thrown overboard the whole of her family\r\nwith its doubtful antecedents, which naturally identified it with that\r\nbrilliant and cosmopolitan society, \"dans laquelle en fait d'hommes, il\r\nn'y a que des déclassés, et en fait de femmes que des trop-bien\r\nclassées.\" The Bonapartes themselves had, after all, a by no means\r\ncleaner bill of health, but, as usual, the woman was made the scapegoat;\r\nfor though a good many men of ancient lineage, such as the Prince\r\nCharles de Beauveau, the Duc de Crillon, the Duc de Beauveau-Craon, the\r\nDuc de Montmorency, the Marquis de Larochejaquelein, the Marquis de\r\nGallifet, the Duc de Mouchy, etc., rallied to the new régime, most of\r\nthem refused at first to bring their wives and daughters to the\r\nTuileries, albeit that they went themselves. When a man neglects to\r\nintroduce his womenkind to the mistress of the house at which he visits,\r\none generally knows the opinion he and the world entertain--rightly or\r\nwrongly--of the status of the lady; and the rule is supposed to hold\r\ngood everywhere throughout civilized society. Yet the Emperor tolerated\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nKnowing what I do of Napoléon's private character, I am inclined to\r\nthink that, but for dynastic and political reasons, he would have\r\nwillingly dispensed with the rigidly virtuous woman at the Tuileries,\r\nthen and afterwards. But at that moment he was perforce obliged to make\r\nadvances to her, and the rebuffs received in consequence were taken with\r\na sang-froid which made those who administered them wince more than\r\nonce. At each renewed refusal he was ready with an epigram: \"Encore une\r\ndame qui n'est pas assez sure de son passé pour braver l'opinion\r\npublique;\" \"Celle-là, c'est la femme de César, hors de tout soupçon,\r\ncomme il y a des criminels qui sont hors la loi;\" \"Madame de ----; il\r\nn'y a pas de faux pas dans sa vie, il n'y a qu'un faux papa, le père de\r\nses enfants.\"\r\n\r\nFor Louis-Napoléon could be exceedingly witty when he liked, and his wit\r\nlost nothing by the manner in which he delivered his witticisms. Not a\r\nmuscle of his face moved--he merely blinked his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Si on avait voulu me donner une princesse allemande,\" he said to his\r\nmost intimate friends, \"je l'aurais épousée: si je ne l'avais pas autant\r\naimée que j'aime Mademoiselle de Montijo, j'aurais au moins été plus sûr\r\nde sa bêtise; avec une Espagnole on n'est jamais sûr.\"\r\n\r\nWhether he meant the remark for his future consort or not, I am unable\r\nto say, but Mademoiselle de Montijo was not witty. There was a kittenish\r\nattempt at wit now and then, as when she said, \"Ici, il n'y a que moi de\r\nlégitimiste;\" but intellectually she was in no way distinguished from\r\nthe majority of her countrywomen.[61] On the other hand, she had an iron\r\nwill, and was very handsome. A woman's beauty is rarely capable of being\r\nanalyzed; he who undertakes such a task is surely doomed to the\r\ndisappointment of the boy who cut the drum to find out where the noise\r\ncame from.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 61: Mérimée, the author of \"Carmen,\" who knew\r\n         something of Spanish women, and of the female members of the\r\n         Montijo family in particular, said that God had given them the\r\n         choice between love and wit, and that they had chosen the\r\n         former.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nI cannot say wherein Mdlle. de Montijo's beauty lay, but she was\r\nbeautiful indeed.\r\n\r\nHer iron will ably seconded the Emperor's attempts at gaining\r\naristocratic recruits round his standard, and when the Duc de Guiche\r\njoined their ranks--the Duc de Guiche whom the Duchesse d'Angoulême had\r\nleft close upon forty thousand pounds a year--Mdlle. de Montijo might\r\nwell be elated with her success. Still, at the celebration of her\r\nnuptials, the gathering was not le dessus du panier. The old noblesse\r\nhad the right to stay away; they had not the right to do what they did.\r\nI am perfectly certain of my facts, else I should not have committed\r\nthem to paper.\r\n\r\nAs usual, on the day of the ceremony, portraits of the new Empress and\r\nher biography were hawked about. There was nothing offensive in either,\r\nbecause the risk of printing anything objectionable would have been too\r\ngreat. In reality, the account of her life was rather too laudatory. But\r\nthere was one picture, better executed than the rest, which bore the\r\nwords, \"_The portrait and the virtues of the Empress_; _the whole for\r\ntwo sous_;\" and that was decidedly the work of the Legitimists and\r\nOrleanists combined. I have ample proof of what I say. I heard\r\nafterwards that the lithograph had been executed in England.\r\n\r\nFor several months after the marriage nothing was spoken or thought of\r\nat the Tuileries but rules of precedence, court dresses, the revival of\r\ncertain ceremonies, functions and entertainments that used to be the\r\nfashion under the ancien régime. The Empress was especially anxious to\r\nmodel her surroundings, her code of life, upon those of\r\nMarie-Antoinette,--\"mon type,\" as she familiarly called the daughter of\r\nMarie-Thérèse. If, in fact, after a little while, some one had been\r\nill-advised enough to tell her that she had not been born in the\r\nImperial purple, she would have scarcely believed it. When a daughter of\r\nthe House of Savoy had the misfortune to marry Napoléon's cousin, the\r\nEmpress thought fit to give the young princess some hints as to her\r\ntoilette and sundry other things. \"You appear to forget, madame,\" was\r\nthe answer, \"that I was born at a court.\" Empress Eugénie was furious,\r\nand never forgave Princess Clotilde. Her anger reminds me of that of a\r\nFrench detective who, having been charged with a very important case,\r\ntook up his quarters with a colleague in one of the best Paris hotels,\r\nexclusively frequented by foreigners of distinction. He assumed the rôle\r\nof a retired ambassador, his comrade enacted the part of his valet, and\r\nboth enacted them to perfection. For a fortnight or more they did not\r\nmake a single mistake in their parts. The ambassador was kind but\r\ndistant to his servant, the latter never omitted to address him as \"Your\r\nExcellency.\" When their mission was at an end, they returned to their\r\nordinary duties; but the \"ambassador\" had become so identified with his\r\npart that, on his colleague addressing him in the usual way, he turned\r\nround indignantly, and exclaimed, \"You seem to forget yourself. What do\r\nyou mean by such familiarity?\"\r\n\r\nOf all the entertainments of the ancien régime lending themselves to\r\nsumptuary and scenic display, \"la chasse\" was undoubtedly the one most\r\nlikely to appeal to the Imperial couple. Louis-Napoléon had, at any\r\nrate, the good sense not to attempt to rival Le Roi-Soleil in\r\nspectacular ballet, or to revive the Eglinton tournament on the Place du\r\nCarrousel. But--\r\n\r\n  \"Il ne fallait au fier Romain\r\n   Que des spectacles et du pain;\r\n   Mais aux Français, plus que Romain,\r\n   Le spectacle suffit sans pain.\"\r\n\r\nNo one was better aware of this tendency of the Parisian to be dazzled\r\nby court pageants than the new Emperor, but he was also aware that,\r\nexcept at the risk of making himself and his new court ridiculous, some\r\nsort of raison d'être would have to be found for such open-air displays\r\nin the capital; pending the invention of a plausible pretext, \"les\r\ngrandes chasses\" at Compiègne were decided upon. They were to be\r\ndifferent from what they had been on the occasion referred to above:\r\nspecial costumes were to be worn, splendid horses purchased; the most\r\nexperienced kennel and huntsmen, imbued with all the grand traditions of\r\n\"la Vénerie,\" recruited from the former establishments of the Condés and\r\nRohans;--in short, such éclat was to be given to them as to make them\r\nnot only the talk of the whole of France, but of Europe besides. The\r\nexperiment was worth trying. Compiègne was less than a hundred miles\r\nfrom Paris; thousands would flock, not only from the neighbouring towns,\r\nbut from the capital also, and the glowing accounts they would be sure\r\nto bring back would produce their effect. There would be, moreover, less\r\nrisk of incurring the remarks of an irreverent Paris mob, a mob which\r\ninstinctively finds out the ridiculous side of every ceremonial\r\ninstituted by the court, except those calculated to gratify its love of\r\nmilitary pomp and splendour. As yet, it was too early to belie the\r\nwords, \"L'empire, c'est la paix;\" we had not got beyond the \"tame eagle\"\r\nperiod, albeit that those behind the scenes, among others a near\r\nconnection of mine, who was more than half a Frenchman himself,\r\npredicted that the predatory instincts would soon reveal themselves,\r\nagainst the Russian bear, probably, and in conjunction with the British\r\nlion,--if not in conjunction with the latter, perhaps against him.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, les grandes chasses et fêtes de Compiègne formed the first\r\nitem of that programme of \"La France qui s'amuse,\"--a programme and\r\nplay which, for nearly eighteen years, drew from all parts of the\r\ncivilized world would-be critics and spectators, few of whom perceived\r\nthat the theatre was undermined, the piece running to a fatal dénoûment,\r\nand the bill itself the most fraudulent concoction that had ever issued\r\nfrom the sanctum of a bogus impressario. But had not Lamartine, only a\r\nfew years previously, suggested, as it were, the tendency of the piece,\r\nwhen, in the Chamber of Deputies, he said, \"Messieurs, j'ai l'honneur et\r\nle regret de vous avertir que la France s'ennuie\"? Louis-Napoléon was\r\ndetermined that no such reproach should be made during his reign. He\r\nprobably did not mean his fireworks to end in the conflagration of\r\nBazeilles, and to read the criticism on his own drama at Wilhelmshöhe,\r\nbut he should have held a tighter hand over his stage-managers. Some of\r\nthese were now getting their reward for having contributed to the\r\nefficient representation of the prologue, which one might entitle \"the\r\nCoup d'État.\" General Magnan was appointed grand veneur--let us say,\r\nmaster of the buckhounds,--with a stipend of a hundred thousand francs;\r\nComte Edgar Ney, his chief coadjutor, with forty thousand francs.\r\nHistory sees the last of the latter gentleman on a cold, dull, drizzly\r\nSeptember morning, of the year 1870. He is seated in an open\r\nchar-à-bancs, by the side of some Prussian officers, and the vehicle, in\r\nthe rear of that of his Imperial master, is on its way to the Belgian\r\nfrontier, en route for Cassel. He is pointing to some artillery which,\r\nnotwithstanding its French model, is being driven by German gunners. \"A\r\nqui ces canons-là?\" \"Ils ne sont pas des nôtres, monsieur,\" is the\r\ncourteous and guarded reply. Verily, his father's exit, after all is\r\nsaid and done, was a more dignified one. Michel Ney, at any rate, fell\r\npierced by bullets; the pity was that they were not the enemy's. In\r\naddition to the grand veneur and premier veneur, there were three\r\nlieutenants de vénerie, a capitaine des chasses à tir,--whom we will\r\ncall a sublimated head-gamekeeper;--and all these dignitaries had other\r\nemoluments and charges besides, because Louis-Napoléon, to his credit be\r\nit said, never forgot a friend.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the \"working personnel\" was, as I have already said,\r\nrecruited from the former establishments of the Condés at Chantilly, of\r\nthe late Duc d'Orléans, the Ducs de Nemours and d'Aumale; and such men\r\nas La Feuille, whose real name was Fergus, and La Trace could not have\r\nfailed to make comparisons between their old masters and the new, not\r\nalways to the advantage of the latter. For though the spectacle was\r\nmagnificent enough, there was little or no hunting, as far as the\r\nmajority of the guests were concerned. After a great deal of\r\ndeliberation, dark green cloth, with crimson velvet collars, cuffs, and\r\nfacings, and gold lace, had been adopted. In Louis XV.'s time, and in\r\nthat of the latter Bourbons, the colour had been blue with silver lace;\r\nbut for this difference the costume was virtually the same, even to the\r\nbuckskins, jackboots, and the \"lampion,\" also edged with gold instead of\r\nsilver.[62] The Emperor's and Empress's had a trimming of white\r\nostrich-feathers. The dress could not be worn, however, by any but the\r\nmembers of the Imperial household, without special permission. The\r\nlatter, of course, wore it by right; but even men like the Duc de\r\nVicence, the Baron d'Offrémont, the Marquis de Gallifet, the Marquis de\r\nCadore, women like the Comtesse de Pourtalès, the Comtesse de Brigode,\r\nthe Marquise de Contades, who held no special charge at court, had to\r\nreceive \"le bouton\" before they could don it.[63]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 62: The lampion was the three-cornered hat, cocked on\r\n         all sides alike in the shape of a spout, and stiffened with\r\n         wire.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 63: \"Wearing the king's button\" is a very old French\r\n         sporting term, signifying permission to wear the dress or the\r\n         buttons or both, similar to those of the monarch when following\r\n         the hounds.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe locale of these gatherings differed according to the seasons.\r\nFontainebleau was chosen for the spring ones, but throughout the reign\r\nCompiègne always offered the most brilliant spectacle, especially after\r\nthe Crimean war, when Napoléon III. was tacitly admitted to the family\r\ncircle of the crowned heads of Europe. The shooting-parties were a\r\ntribute offered to the taste of the English visitors, who, after that\r\nperiod, became more numerous every succeeding autumn, and who,\r\naccustomed as they were to their own magnificent meets and lavish\r\nhospitality at the most renowned country seats, could not help\r\nexpressing their surprise at the utterly reckless expenditure; and, if\r\nthe truth must be told, enjoyed the freedom from all restraint, though\r\nit was cunningly hidden beneath an apparently very formidable code of\r\ncourtly etiquette. As one of these distinguished Englishmen said, \"They\r\nhave done better than banish Mrs. Grundy; they have given her a special\r\ninvitation, and drugged her the moment she came in.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court invariably arrived on the first of November, and generally\r\nstayed for three weeks or a month, according to the date fixed for the\r\nopening of the Chambers. From that moment the town, a very sleepy though\r\nexceedingly pretty one, became like a fair. Unless you had engaged your\r\nroom beforehand at one of the hotels, the chances were a thousand to one\r\nin favour of your having to roam the streets; for there were hundreds\r\nand hundreds of sight-seers, French as well as foreign, desirous of\r\nfollowing the hounds, which every one was free to do. In addition to\r\nthese, many functionaries, not sufficiently important to be favoured\r\nwith an invitation to the Château, but eager for an opportunity of\r\nattracting the notice of the sovereign--for Napoléon was a very\r\nimpulsive monarch, who often took sudden fancies--had to be\r\naccommodated, not to mention flying columns of the demi-monde, \"pas trop\r\nbien assurées sur la fidélité de leurs protecteurs en-titre et voulant\r\nles sauvegarder contre les attaques de leurs rivales dans l'entourage\r\nimpérial.\" What with these and others, a room, on the top story, was\r\noften quoted at sixty or seventy francs per day. I know a worthy\r\nlieutenant of the cavalry of the Garde who made a pretty sum, for two\r\nyears running, by engaging three apartments at each of the five good\r\nhotels, for the whole of the Emperor's stay. His regiment was quartered\r\nat Compiègne, and, as a matter of course, his friends from Paris applied\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident happened in connection with this scarcity of\r\naccommodation. The French railways in those days got a great many of\r\ntheir rails from England. The representative of one of these English\r\nmakers found out, however, that the profits on his contracts were pretty\r\nwell being swallowed up by the baksheesh he had to distribute among the\r\nvarious government officials and others. In his perplexity, he sought\r\nadvice of an English nobleman, who had his grandes et petites entrées to\r\nthe Tuileries, and the latter promised to get him an audience of the\r\nEmperor. It so happened that the Court was on the eve of its departure,\r\nbut Napoléon wrote that he would see the agent at Compiègne. On the day\r\nappointed, the Englishman came. Having made up his mind to combine\r\npleasure with business, he had brought his portmanteau in order to stay\r\nfor a day or so. Previous to the interview he had applied at every\r\nhotel, at every private house where there was a chance of getting a\r\nroom, but without success. His luggage was in a cab on the Place du\r\nChâteau. Napoléon was, as usual, very kind, promised him his aid, but\r\nasked him to let the matter rest until the next day, when he would have\r\nan opportunity of consulting a high authority on the subject who was\r\ncoming down that very afternoon. \"Give me your address, and I will let\r\nyou know, the first thing in the morning, when I can see you,\" said the\r\nEmperor in English.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman looked very embarrassed. \"I have no address, sire. I have\r\nbeen unable to get a room anywhere,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I dare say we can put you up somewhere here,\" laughed the Emperor,\r\nand called to one of his aides-de-camp, to whom he gave instructions.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman and the officer departed together, but the Château was\r\nquite as full as the rest of the town.\r\n\r\n\"I'll ask Baptiste,\" said the officer at last, having tried every\r\npossible means.\r\n\r\nBaptiste was one of the Emperor's principal grooms, and very willing to\r\nhelp; but, alas! he had only a very small room himself, and that was\r\nshared by his wife.\r\n\r\n\"If monsieur don't mind,\" said Baptiste, \"I will make him up a good bed\r\nin one of the fourgons\"--one of the luggage-vans.\r\n\r\nSo said, so done. The Englishman slept like a top, being very\r\ntired,--too much like a top, for he never stirred until he found himself\r\nrudely awakened by a heavy bundle of rugs and other paraphernalia being\r\nflung on his chest. He was at the station. Baptiste had simply forgotten\r\nto mention the fact of his having transformed the fourgon into a\r\nbedroom; the doors that stood ajar during the night had been closed\r\nwithout the servant looking inside; and when the occupant was discovered\r\nhe was, as Racine says--\r\n\r\n  \"Dans le simple appareil\r\n   D'une beauté qu'on vient d'arracher au sommeil.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he told the Emperor, the latter laughed, \"as he had never seen him\r\nlaugh before,\" said the aide-de-camp, who had been the innocent cause of\r\nthe mischief by appealing to Baptiste.\r\n\r\nThe victim of the misadventure did not mind it much. For many years\r\nafterwards, he averred that the sight of Compiègne in those days would\r\nhave compensated for the inconvenience of sleeping on a garden seat.\r\nWhat was more, he and his firm were never troubled any more with\r\ninexorable demands for baksheesh.\r\n\r\nHe was right; the sight of Compiègne in those days was very beautiful.\r\nThere was a good deal of the histrionic mixed up with it, but it was\r\nvery beautiful. In addition to the bands of the garrison, a regimental\r\nband of the infantry of the Garde played in the courtyard of the\r\nChâteau; the streets were alive with crowds dressed in their best;\r\nalmost every house was gay with bunting, the only exceptions being those\r\nof the Legitimists, who, unlike Achilles, did not even skulk in their\r\ntents, but shut up their establishments and flitted on the eve of the\r\narrival of the Court, after having despatched an address of unswerving\r\nloyalty to the Comte de Chambord. After a little while, Napoléon did not\r\ntrouble about these expressions of hostility to his dynasty, though he\r\ncould not forbear to ask bitterly, now and then, whether the Comte de\r\nChambord or the Comte de Paris under a regency could have made the\r\ncountry more prosperous than he had attempted to do, than he succeeded\r\nin doing. And truth compels one to admit that France's material\r\nprosperity was not a sham in those days, whatever else may have been;\r\nfor in those days, as I have already remarked, the end was still\r\ndistant, and there were probably not a thousand men in the whole of\r\nEurope who foresaw the nature of it, albeit that a thirtieth or a\r\nfortieth part of them may have been in Compiègne at the very time when\r\nthe Emperor, in his elegantly appointed break, drove from the Place du\r\nChâteau amidst the acclamations of the serried crowds lining the roads.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the arrival of the Emperor--the train reached Compiègne\r\nabout four--there was neither dinner-party nor reception at the Château.\r\nThe civil and military authorities of Compiègne went to the station to\r\nwelcome the Imperial couple, the rangers of Compiègne and Laigue forests\r\nwaited upon his Majesty to arrange the programme, and generally joined\r\nthe Imperial party at dinner; but the fêtes did not commence until the\r\nsecond day after the arrival, _i. e._ with the advent of the first batch\r\nof guests, who reached the Château exactly twenty-four hours after their\r\nhosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n     Society during the Empire -- The series of guests at Compiègne --\r\n     The amusements -- the absence of musical taste in the Bonapartes\r\n     -- The programme on the first, second, third, and fourth days --\r\n     An anecdote of Lafontaine, the actor -- Theatrical performances\r\n     and balls -- The expenses of the same -- The theatre at Compiègne\r\n     -- The guests, male and female -- \"Neck or nothing\" for the\r\n     latter, uniform for the former -- The rest have to take \"back\r\n     seats\" -- The selection of guests among the notabilities of\r\n     Compiègne -- A mayor's troubles -- The Empress's and the\r\n     Emperor's conflicting opinions with regard to female charms --\r\n     Bassano in \"hot water\" -- Tactics of the demi-mondaines --\r\n     Improvement from the heraldic point of view in the Empress's\r\n     entourage -- The cocodettes -- Their dress -- Worth -- When every\r\n     pretext for a change of toilette is exhausted, the court ladies\r\n     turn themselves into ballerinas -- \"Le Diable à Quatre\" at\r\n     Compiègne -- The ladies appear at the ball afterwards in their\r\n     gauze skirts -- The Emperor's dictum with regard to\r\n     ballet-dancers and men's infatuation for them -- The Emperor did\r\n     not like stupid women -- The Emperor's \"eye\" for a handsome woman\r\n     -- The Empress does not admire the instinct -- William I. of\r\n     Prussia acts as comforter -- The hunt -- Actors, \"supers,\" and\r\n     spectators -- \"La Comtesse d'Escarbagnas\" -- The Imperial\r\n     procession -- The Empress's and Emperor's unpunctuality --\r\n     Louis-Napoléon not a \"well-dressed man\" -- The Empress wished to\r\n     get back before dark -- The reason of this wish -- Though\r\n     unpunctual, punctual on hunt-days -- The police measures at those\r\n     gatherings -- M.

Boitelle -- The Empress did not\r\n     like the truth, the Emperor did -- Her anxiety to go to St.\r\n     Lazare.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guests were divided into five series, each of which stayed four days\r\nexclusive of the day of their arrival and that of their departure. Each\r\nseries consisted of between eighty and ninety guests.\r\n\r\nThe amusements provided were invariably the same for each series of\r\nguests. On the day of their arrival there was the dinner, followed by\r\ncharades, and a carpet dance to the accompaniment of the piano--or, to\r\nspeak by the card, of the piano-organ. It was an instrument similar to\r\nthat which nowadays causes so much delight to the children in the\r\nstreets of London, and, as far as I can remember, the first of its kind\r\nI had ever seen. The male guests, and not always the youngest, relieved\r\none another in turning the handle. Mechanical as was the task, it\r\nrequired a certain ear for time, and they were often found sadly wanting\r\nin that respect. It was rather comical to see a grave minister of State\r\nsolemnly grinding out tunes, and being called to task every now and\r\nagain for his incapacity. The worst offender, the most hopeless\r\nperformer, was undoubtedly the Emperor himself. The Bonapartes are one\r\nand all devoid of the slightest taste for music. I think it is De\r\nBourriènne--but I will not be certain--who speaks of the founder of the\r\ndynasty humming as he went along from one apartment to another. \"Et Dieu\r\nsait comme il chantait faux,\" adds the chronicler in despair. That part\r\nof the great man's mantle had decidedly fallen upon his nephew. I\r\nremember the latter trying to distinguish himself on that piano-organ\r\none evening. M. de Maupas, who was the prefect of police at the time of\r\nthe Coup d'État, and minister of police afterwards, was among the\r\nguests. The ambulant musician in Paris has to get a kind of licence from\r\nthe prefecture of police, the outward sign of which is a brass badge,\r\nwhich he is bound to wear suspended from his button-hole. While the\r\nEmperor was trying to make the company waltz, one of the ladies suddenly\r\nturned round to M. de Maupas: \"Si jamais l'empereur vous demande la\r\npermission de jouer dans la rue, refusez lui, monsieur; refusez lui,\r\npour l'amour du ciel et de la musique,\" she said aloud: and the Emperor\r\nhimself could not help smiling at the well-deserved rebuke. \"Madame,\" he\r\nreplied, \"if ever I am reduced to such a strait, I will take you into\r\npartnership: I will make you sing, and I will collect the pence.\" In\r\nspite of his musical deficiencies the Emperor was right; the lady was\r\nMadame Conneau, who had and has still one of the most beautiful voices\r\never heard on the professional or amateur stage.\r\n\r\nOn the first day following that of the arrival of the guests, there was\r\na shooting-party, or, rather, there were two--one in the home park for\r\nthe Emperor himself, who was not a bad shot, and a dozen of the more\r\nimportant personages; another in the forest. Those who did not care for\r\nsport were at liberty to remain with the ladies, who, under the\r\ndirection of the Empress, proceeded to the lawn. Croquet, as far as I\r\nknow, had not been invented then, but archery lent itself to posing and\r\nflirtation quite as well, and the costumes worn on such occasions were\r\ntruly a sight for the gods.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of that day, there was a performance in the theatre,\r\nbuilt for the express purpose by Louis-Philippe, but which had been\r\nconsiderably embellished since. The companies of the Comédie-Française,\r\nthe Odéon, the Gymnase, the Vaudeville, and the Palais-Royal took it in\r\nturns. Only the members of the Comédie-Française had the privilege of\r\npaying their respects in the Imperial box. It was during one of the\r\nperformances of the Gymnase company that the following amusing incident\r\noccurred. They were playing \"Le Fils de Famille\" of Bayard and De\r\nBiéville,[64] and the Emperor was strolling in the lobbies before the\r\nperformance, when he noticed an old colonel of lancers, whom he did not\r\nremember to have seen among the guests during the daytime, but who\r\nseemed perfectly at home. He had not even donned his full regimentals.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 64: Known on the English stage as the \"Queen's\r\n         Shilling,\" by Mr. Godfrey.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"Voilà un vrai, beau militaire,\" said the sovereign to one of his\r\naides-de-camp; \"allez demander son nom.\"\r\n\r\nThe aide-de-camp returned in a moment. \"Il s'appelle Lafontaine, sire;\r\net il appartient au régiment du Gymnase.\"\r\n\r\n\"Comment, au régiment du Gymnase?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mais oui, sire; c'est Lafontaine, le comédien.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the assumption was so thoroughly realistic, that even a better\r\njudge than Louis-Napoléon might have been deceived by it.\r\n\r\nThose performances were really most brilliant affairs, and an invitation\r\nto them was only less highly prized than that to the ball which always\r\nfollowed the play on November 15th, the Empress's fête-day.[65] The cost\r\nof each performance was estimated at between twenty and thirty thousand\r\nfrancs, according to the company performing. I am repeating the official\r\nstatement, though inclined to think it somewhat exaggerated. Except the\r\nOpéra or Opéra-Comique, there was not then, nor is there now, a theatre\r\nin Paris whose nightly receipts, with \"the greatest success,\" exceed\r\nseven or eight thousand francs. Allowing for an additional three\r\nthousand francs for railway travelling and sundry expenses, I fail to\r\nsee how the remainder of the sum was disbursed, unless it was in\r\ndouceurs to the performers. There is less doubt, however, about the\r\nexpenses of the Château during this annual series of fêtes. It could not\r\nhave been less than forty-five thousand francs per diem, and must have\r\noften risen to fifty thousand francs, exclusive of the cost of the\r\ntheatrical performances, because the luxe displayed on these occasions\r\nwas truly astonishing--I had almost said appalling.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 65: The Sainte-Eugénie, according to the Church\r\n         Calendar. In France, it is not the birthday, but the day of the\r\n         patron-saint whose name one bears, which is\r\n         celebrated.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe theatre was built on the old-fashioned principle, and what we call\r\nstalls were not known in those days. There was something analogous to\r\nthem at the Opéra and the Théâtre-Français, but they were exclusively\r\nreserved to the male sex. Both these theatres still keep up the same\r\ntraditions in that respect. At Compiègne the whole of the ground floor,\r\nparterre, or pit, as we have misnamed it--\"groundlings\" is a much more\r\nappropriate word, perhaps, than \"pittites\"--was occupied by the officers\r\nof all grades of the regiments quartered at Compiègne and in the\r\ndepartment. The chefs de corps and the chief dignitaries of State filled\r\nthe amphitheatre, which rose in a gentle slope from the back of the\r\nparterre to just below the first tier of boxes, or rather to the balcony\r\ntier, seeing that the only box on it was the Imperial one. The latter,\r\nhowever, took up much more than the centre, for it had been constructed\r\nto seat about two hundred persons. Only a slight partition, elbow high,\r\ndivided it from the rest of the tier, whence the sterner sex was\r\nabsolutely banished. The display of bare arms and shoulders was\r\nsomething marvellous, for they were by no means equally worthy of\r\nadmiration, and the stranger, ignorant of the court regulations, must\r\nhave often asked himself why certain ladies should have been so reckless\r\nas to invite comparison with their more favoured sisters. It was because\r\nthere was no choice. The slightest gauze was rigorously prohibited, and\r\nwoe to the lady who ventured to disobey these regulations. One of the\r\nchambellans was sure to request her to retire. \"L'épaule ou l'épaulette\"\r\nwas the title of a comic song of those days, in allusion to the\r\nEmpress's determination to suffer none but resplendent uniforms and ball\r\ndresses within sight of her. If I remember aright, the chorus went like\r\nthis--\r\n\r\n  \"Je ne porte pas l'épaulette,\r\n   Je ne puis me décoll'ter,\r\n   Je ne suis qu'un vieux bonhomme,\r\n   Donc, je ne suis pas invité.\"\r\n\r\nFor even the guests in plain evening dress were mercilessly relegated to\r\nthe tier above that of the Imperial box, and, even when there, were not\r\npermitted to occupy the first rows. These also were reserved for the\r\nfairer portion of humanity.\r\n\r\nThis fairer portion of humanity, thus ostensibly privileged, embittered\r\nthe lives of the poor mayor and sub-prefect of Compiègne. The wives of\r\nthe local notabilities and of the government officials, in addition to\r\nthose of some of the landed gentry of the Empire, were not only anxious\r\nto be present at these gatherings, but generally insisted on having the\r\nfront seats, at any rate in the second circle. Their applications,\r\ntransmitted by these dignitaries to the Duc de Bassano, were always in\r\nexcess of the room at his disposal, and, being an utter stranger to all\r\nthese ladies, he had virtually to choose at random, or, if not at\r\nrandom, to be guided by the mayor and sub-prefect, who were consulted,\r\nnot with regard to the greater or lesser degree of opulent charms and\r\ncomeliness of features of these fair applicants, but with regard to\r\ntheir social status and fair fame. Now, it so happens that in France\r\n\"L'amour fait des siennes\" in the provinces as well as in the capital;\r\nhe only disdains what Mirabeau used to call \"les fées concombres.\" The\r\nEmpress, provided the shoulders and arms were bare, did not trouble much\r\nabout either their colour or \"moulded outline;\" the Emperor, on the\r\ncontrary, objected, both from personal as well as artistic reasons, to\r\nhave the curved symmetry of the two circles marred by the introduction\r\nof so many living problems of Euclid; and it really seemed as if the\r\ndevil wanted to have all the good shapes to himself, for the reputedly\r\nvirtuous spinsters, widows, and matrons were angular enough to have\r\nsatisfied a tutor of mathematics. There was a dilemma: if they were put\r\nin the front rows, the Emperor scolded Bassano, who in his turn scolded\r\nthe mayor and the sub-prefect. If the less virtuous but more attractive\r\nwere put in the front rows, there was frequently a small scandal; for\r\nthe Empress, at the first sight of them, had them expelled, after which\r\nshe scolded Bassano, who avenged himself for his having been reprimanded\r\non the mayor and sub-prefect. Furthermore, the contingent from Paris,\r\nsome of whom were often provided with letters of introduction from\r\ninfluential personages to the latter gentleman, were not always without\r\nreproach though ever without fear; but how were two provincial\r\nmagistrates to know this? Those sirens could almost impose upon them\r\nwith impunity, and did; so, upon the whole, the magistrates did not have\r\na pleasant time of it, for in the case of the former damsels or veuves\r\nde Malabar both the Emperor and the Empress were equally strict--though,\r\nperhaps, from utterly different motives.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the esclandres were comparatively rare, and the house\r\nitself presented a sight unparalleled perhaps throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of Europe. At nine o'clock, Comte Bacciochi, the first\r\nchambellan, in his court dress descended the few steps leading from the\r\nfoyer to the Imperial box, and, advancing to the front, announced, \"The\r\nEmperor.\" Every one rose and remained standing until the Emperor and\r\nEmpress, who entered immediately afterwards, had seated themselves in\r\nthe crimson velvet and gilt arm-chairs which the gentlemen-in-waiting\r\n(les chambellans de service) rolled forward.\r\n\r\nI have spoken elsewhere of the immediate entourage of the Imperial\r\nhosts, and may therefore pass them over in silence here. As the\r\nNapoleonic dynasty became apparently more consolidated both at home and\r\nabroad, this entourage gradually changed--though no truthful observer\r\ncould have honestly averred that the change was for the better. The\r\ndécavés and the déclassées of the first period disappeared altogether,\r\nor underwent a truly marvellous financial and social metamorphosis: the\r\nmen, by means of speculations, chiefly connected with the\r\n\"Haussmannizing\" of Paris, the successful carrying out of which was\r\ngreatly facilitated by their position at court; the women by marriages,\r\nthe conditions of which I prefer not to discuss. An undoubtedly genuine\r\nleaven of names to be found in \"D'Hozier,\"[66] came to swell the ranks\r\nof the hitherto somewhat shady courtiers of both sexes. Unfortunately,\r\ntheir blood was not only thicker than water, and consequently more\r\neasily heated, but they presumed upon the blueness of it to set public\r\nopinion at defiance.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 66: \"D'Hozier,\" the French \"Burke,\" so named after\r\n         its founder, Pierre D'Hozier, the creator of the science of\r\n         French genealogy.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n  \"Ce qui, chez les mortels, est une effronterie\r\n   Entre nous autres demi-dieux\r\n   N'est qu'honnête galanterie.\"\r\n\r\nThus wrote the Duchesse du Maine[67] to her brother, of whom she was\r\nperhaps a little more fond than even their blood-relationship\r\nwarranted. This privilege of stealing the horse, while the meaner-born\r\nmight not even look over the hedge, was claimed by the sons and the\r\ndaughters of the old noblesse, who condescended to grace the court of\r\nNapoléon III., with a cynicism worthy of the most libertine traditions\r\nof the ancien régime; and neither the Empress nor the Emperor did\r\nanything to discountenance the claim. The former, provided that \"tout se\r\npassait en famille,\" closed her eyes to many things she ought not to\r\nhave tolerated. At the Tuileries, a certain measure of decorum was\r\npreferred; at Compiègne and Fontainebleau, where the house was \"packed\"\r\nas it were, the most flagrant eccentricities, to call them by no harsher\r\nname, were not only permitted, but tacitly encouraged by the Empress.\r\nThis was especially the case when the first series of guests was gone.\r\nIt generally included the most serious portion of the visitors, \"les\r\nennuyeurs, les empêcheurs de danser en rond,\"[68] as they were called.\r\nThe ladies belonging to, or classed in that category, presented, no\r\ndoubt, a striking contrast to those of the succeeding series, in which\r\nthe English element was not always conspicuous by its absence. The\r\ncostumes of the latter were something wonderful to behold. The cloth\r\nskirt, which had then been recently introduced from England, and the\r\ncloth dress, draped elegantly over it, enabled their wearers to defy all\r\nkinds of weather. And as they went tramping down the muddy roads, their\r\ncoquettish little hats daintily poised on enormous chignons, their\r\nwalking boots displaying more than the regulation part of ankle, the\r\nless sophisticated Compiègnois stared with all their might at the\r\nstrange company from the Château, and no wonder. Still, the surprise of\r\nthe inhabitants was small compared to that of the troopers of the\r\ngarrison at the invasion of their riding-school by such a contingent,\r\nwhich indulged in ring-tilting, not unfrequently in tent-pegging, and,\r\nmore frequently still, \"in taking a header into space,\" to the great\r\namusement of their companions.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 67: Anne, Louise, Bénédicte de Bourbon, Princesse de\r\n         Condé, who married the Duc du Maine, the illegitimate son of\r\n         Louis XIV. and Madame de Montespan. She disliked her husband,\r\n         whom she considered socially beneath her, and who was very ugly\r\n         besides. The lines quoted above are probably not hers, but\r\n         Malezieu's, \"her poet in ordinary,\" who also organized her\r\n         amateur theatricals.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 68: Idiomatically, \"the bores, the spoil-sports, or\r\n         wet-blankets.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIn those days, Worth was not quite king; the cocodettes of the Imperial\r\ncircle were still prophesying on their own account. The \"arsenal des\r\nmodes,\" as Madame Émile de Girardin had boastingly called Paris but ten\r\nyears previously, had as yet not been boldly taken by storm by a native\r\nof bucolic Lincolnshire. But in a very short time he became the absolute\r\nautocrat in matters of feminine apparel. It was not even an enlightened\r\ndespotism. His will was law. Every different entertainment required its\r\nappropriate costume, and the costume was frequently the sole pretext for\r\nthe entertainment. And when the ingenuity in devising both was in danger\r\nof becoming exhausted, the supreme resource of these ladies was to turn\r\nthemselves into ballerinas; not into ballerinas as King Bomba, or the\r\nComte Sosthène de la Rochefoucauld, or M. Rouher would have had them,\r\nbut into ballerinas with the shortest of gauze skirts and pink silk\r\nfleshings.\r\n\r\nOne year, I am not certain of the exact one,--I know that the future\r\nEmperor of Germany was there,--the ladies hit upon the idea of giving a\r\nsurprise to the Emperor and Empress on the occasion of the latter's\r\nfête-day. A ballet-master was sent for in hot haste from Paris, and \"Le\r\nDiable à Quatre\" put in rehearsal. Unlike Peter the Great, who had a\r\nsoldier hanged--he said shooting was too good for him--for having\r\nrepresented a disreputable character on the stage, the Emperor professed\r\nhimself exceedingly pleased; and the ladies, among whom was Princess von\r\nMetternich, were sent for from the Imperial box to be complimented by\r\nthe sovereign. At the ball which followed the entertainment, they\r\nappeared in their theatrical dresses. Every one was delighted. \"Après\r\ntout,\" said Napoléon, blinking his eyes, \"avec cette manie des hommes de\r\ncourir après des danseuses, il vaut mieux leur en fournir de bonne\r\nmaison.\"\r\n\r\nThe philosophy was unassailable, and, to a certain extent, acted upon by\r\nits professor. Napoléon only admired dancers on the stage. He thought,\r\nwith Balzac, that the extraordinary physical strain upon the lower\r\nextremities necessarily interfered with the intellectual development \"at\r\nthe other end.\" \"L'esprit de la danseuse est dans ses jambes, et je\r\nn'aime pas les femmes bêtes,\" he remarked; for the Emperor, like most of\r\nthe members of his family, did not scruple to apply the right word, when\r\ntalking to his familiars.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, until he was assured of the stupidity of a woman by more\r\nintimate acquaintance, he was too much inclined to be attracted by the\r\nfirst handsome face he saw, or, to speak by the card, by the first\r\nhandsome face he picked out for himself. The moment he was seated by\r\nthe side of the Empress in the Imperial box, during one of those\r\nperformances I mentioned just now, he swept the house with his\r\nopera-glass, and unerringly the glass stopped at what was really the\r\nhandsomest woman in the house, whether she was seated on the tier with\r\nhim or in the upper one--of course, I mean \"the handsomest woman\" among\r\nthe strangers, because on such occasions the Emperor paid but little\r\nattention to those who were generally around him. The Empress was fain\r\nto put up with these peccadilloes: she could not be always running away\r\nto Schwalbach or to Scotland; besides, she knew that she would have to\r\ncome back again. Some months previous to the performance of \"Le Diable à\r\nQuatre,\" she went to the former place to hide her mortification. William\r\nof Prussia was at Baden-Baden at the time, and he immediately left the\r\ndelightful society and the magnificent roulades of Pauline Lucca to\r\noffer his sympathies to the Griselda who had fled from her home\r\ntroubles, forgetting that there was another one at home, who would have\r\neven been more glad of his company.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the shooting-party and the theatrical performance,\r\nthere was generally an excursion to Pierrefonds, and afterwards to the\r\nmagnificent Roman remains at Champlieu. In the evening there were\r\ncharades and carpet dances as usual.\r\n\r\nThe third day was always reserved for the most important part of the\r\nprogramme--the stag-hunt. Candidly speaking, I doubt whether Napoléon,\r\nthough a very excellent horseman, cared much for this sport, as\r\nconducted on the grand traditional lines of the French \"code of\r\nvénerie.\" His main object personally was a good stiff run with the\r\nhounds, such as he had been used to in England, troubling himself little\r\nwhether the pack kept the scent or not. In fact, there were generally\r\ntwo packs out, one of purely English breed, which was followed by the\r\nEmperor and his guests; the other French, followed by the serious lovers\r\nof sport, who, as a rule, caught at every pretext to get away from the\r\nmagnificently apparelled crowd, driving or riding in the wake of the\r\nsovereign. Among the former there was a considerable sprinkling of the\r\nlanded gentry of the neighbourhood, monarchists and legitimists to a\r\nman, some of whom did not even condescend to honour the Emperor with a\r\nsalute. Compiègne, Sénart, etc., were, after all, public property, and\r\nthey could do as they liked, though I have got an idea that this wilful\r\nslight was an instance of singular bad taste on the part of these\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nThe spot fixed for the meet was invariably the large clearing known as\r\nthe Carrefour du Puits-du-Roi, whence radiated eight immense avenues,\r\nstretching as far as the uttermost confines of the forest of Compiègne.\r\nThe spot, apart from its associations with royalty, from the days of\r\nClovis up to our own, was admirably chosen, the mise-en-scène worthy of\r\nthe greatest stage-manager on record. The huge centre itself was kept\r\nclear by the gendarmes de chasse--a cross between a mounted constable\r\nand a ranger--from any but the officers of the garrison on horseback and\r\nother persons privileged to join the Emperor's suite. Six of the avenues\r\nwere free to the pedestrians, who could watch every movement from their\r\nvantage point; the seventh was set apart for carriages of all sorts,\r\nfrom the humble shandrydan of the local notary and doctor to the\r\nmagnificent break of the neighbouring landed proprietor, or the less\r\ncorrectly but more showily appointed barouches of the leaders of\r\nprovincial society, who rarely missed an opportunity of attending these\r\ngatherings, where there were so many chances of coming in contact with\r\nthe court. Relegated for at least ten months of the year--allowing for\r\nan annual visit to the capital--to the dull, humdrum, though often\r\npretentious round of entertainments of her own circle, the Comtesse\r\nd'Esbargnas,[69] whether young or old, handsome or the reverse, matron\r\nor widow, of patrician or plebeian origin, sedulously watched the yearly\r\nrecurring time and tide that might lead to a permanent footing at the\r\nTuileries. What has happened once may happen again. Agnès Sorel, Diane\r\nde Poitiers, Gabrielle d'Estrées, Louise de la Vallière, let alone\r\nJeanne Bécu and Jeanne Poisson,[70] had by no means exhausted the\r\npossibilities of sudden elevations to within a step of the throne. These\r\nnew aspirants would be content with a less giddy position. And who could\r\nsay what might happen? Had not Alfred de Musset, the daring poet of \"les\r\ngrandes passions,\" written a play entitled \"Il ne faut jurer de rien\"?\r\nAssuredly what had happened once might happen again. Meanwhile the\r\npleasure of watching all this splendour was worth coming for.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 69: A character of one of Molière's plays, who lends\r\n         her name to the play itself, and who, with her provincial\r\n         clique, apes the manners of the court.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 70: Mesdames Du Barry and Pompadour.]\r\n\r\nThe latter proposition hardly admitted of discussion. The sight was\r\ntruly worth coming for. Though the Imperial suite never made its\r\nappearance before one, the main arteries of the forest became crowded as\r\nearly as eleven. Half an hour later came La Trace and La Feuille with\r\ntheir équipage.[71] The kennelmen and huntsmen in full dress gathered\r\nround a roaring fire, their hounds lying at their feet. The stablemen\r\nand grooms, in undress livery of green and brown, walking the hunters of\r\nthe Emperor and his suite to and fro, presented a picture full of colour\r\nand animation.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 71: \"Équipage\" is the right word. Applied to any but\r\n         military or hunting uses, it is out of place, though frequently\r\n         thus used.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nAs a rule the Imperial cortége was punctual on those occasions, though\r\nit was often remiss in that respect at gatherings of a different nature.\r\nAmong the familiars at the Tuileries the blame for this general\r\nunpunctuality was attributed in an equal measure to both the Emperor and\r\nthe Empress. The latter dressed very slowly, and the former wanted to\r\ndress too quickly. The result of this difference of habit was always\r\nmanifest to the most casual observer. The Empress, after the most\r\nfatiguing day or soirée, always looked as if she had just left her\r\ndressing-room, the Emperor at the beginning of the same as if he had\r\nscarcely been in it. But on \"grand hunt-days\" the Empress was never a\r\nminute late; and the reason, apart from the natural wish to exercise \"la\r\npolitesse des rois,\" exactitude, was a curious one, but for the truth of\r\nwhich I can vouch. It gets dark early in November, and the Empress\r\ndreaded to be overtaken by darkness in the forest, even amidst a crowd.\r\nIt reminded her of a disagreeable episode during her first stay at\r\nCompiègne, when she was still Mdlle. Eugénie de Montijo. She and her\r\nfuture husband had got separated from the rest of the party. It was\r\nnever accurately known what happened, but she was found sitting quietly\r\nbut sorely distressed on her horse by M. de Saint-Paul, the sub-ranger,\r\nwho escorted her back to the Château. She explained her lonely and\r\nuncomfortable position by the fact that her companion's horse had\r\nsuddenly taken the bit between its teeth. The explanation was a lame\r\none, seeing that the Prince-President, on his return, hours before, had\r\nlooked perfectly composed and not as much as mentioned her name. The\r\ntruth leaked out afterwards. Enraged at Mdlle. de Montijo's refusal to\r\ngrant him a clandestine interview for that night, her princely suitor\r\nhad left her to find her way back as best she could.\r\n\r\nInvariably, then, at the stroke of one, the Imperial procession was\r\nsignalled, for it was nothing less than a procession. At its head rode\r\nthe chief ranger of Compiègne, Baron de Wimpffen, in a magnificent\r\nhunting-coat of green and gold, the laced tricornered hat, surmounted by\r\na bunch of black plumes, jackboots, and white doeskins. Then came the\r\nImperial break, drawn by six horses, mounted by postilions in powdered\r\nwigs, the Imperial host and hostess on the front seat, the members of\r\nthe family, or some illustrious guests, behind; the rest of the breaks\r\nwere only four-horsed, and the procession was closed by the carriage of\r\nM. Hyrvoix, the chief of the secret police. In Paris this arrangement\r\nwas reversed, and M. Hyrvoix, who had the rank of a prefect, and took\r\nhis place as such at all public functions, preceded instead of following\r\nthe Imperial carriage.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think, notwithstanding the frequent outcries against\r\nthe secret police during the second empire, that M. Hyrvoix was a\r\nthoroughly upright and conscientious servant. Unfortunately for himself\r\nand his Imperial masters, his position was a difficult one; for though\r\nprofessedly employed to gauge public opinion with regard to the dynasty,\r\nhis reports to that effect were not always received with the\r\nconsideration due to honest truth, at any rate by the Empress.\r\nThroughout these pages, I have endeavoured as far as possible to jot\r\ndown my recollections in a kind of chronological order, rather than in\r\nthe order they occurred to me; but in this, as in many other instances,\r\nI have been obliged to anticipate the course of events lest they should\r\nslip my memory, for I had no documents to go by, and also to avoid\r\nunnecessary repetitions. This particular part of my somewhat disjointed\r\nnarrative was meant to deal with the festivities at Compiègne and the\r\ncompany there; on reading it over, I find that it has developed into a\r\nfragment of biography of the Emperor and his Consort. As such, the\r\nfollowing stories will throw a valuable side light on their different\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of Emperor Maximilian's death reached Paris, there was the\r\nrumbling of a storm which foreboded no good. For days before, there had\r\nbeen vague rumours of the catastrophe. It had been whispered at the\r\nannual distribution of prizes at the Collége de France, where one of\r\nthe young Cavaignacs had refused to receive his reward at the hands of\r\nthe Prince Imperial. In short, indignation was rife among all classes.\r\nThe Empress, on hearing of the insult, had burst into hysterical tears,\r\nand been obliged to leave the reception-rooms. In short, a dark cloud\r\nhung over the Tuileries. I have spoken elsewhere of the Mexican\r\nexpedition, so need not enlarge upon it here. We will take it that both\r\nNapoléon and his wife were altogether blameless in the affair--which was\r\nby no means the case,--but a moment's reflection ought to have shown\r\nthem that appearances were against them, and that the discontent\r\nexpressed was so far justified. I am under the impression that Napoléon\r\nhimself looked at it in that way; he bowed to the storm; he regretted,\r\nbut did not resent people speaking ill of him. Not so the Empress; the\r\ntruth was only welcome to her when it flattered her; she really fancied\r\nherself an autocrat by the Grace of God, as the previous Bourbons\r\ninterpreted the term. In spite of all that has been said about her\r\namiability, about her charity, Eugénie was in reality cruel at heart. No\r\nwoman, not cruel, could have taken the principal part in a scene which I\r\nwill describe presently. But she was vindictive also, and, what was\r\nworse, blindly vindictive. Though firmly convinced that she reigned by\r\nright divine, she had felt more than once that private revenge on \"the\r\npeople\" who abused her was beyond her power. She not only fretted\r\naccordingly, but often vented her wrath on the first victim that came to\r\nhand, albeit that the latter was generally the mere innocent conveyance\r\nthrough which the voice of \"the people\" reached her. M. Hyrvoix, in\r\nvirtue of his functions, often found himself the echo of that voice. He\r\nwas generally the first of all the officials to present his daily\r\nreport. The Emperor gave him his cue by asking, \"What do the people\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\nOn that particular morning, after the death of Maximilian had become\r\nknown, the answer came not as readily as usual; for the chief of the\r\nsecret police was not in the habit of mincing matters. This time,\r\nhowever, M. Hyrvoix kept silent for a while, then replied, \"The people\r\ndo not say anything, sire.\"\r\n\r\nNapoléon must have noticed the hesitating manner; for he said at once,\r\n\"You are not telling me the truth. What do the people say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sire, if you wish to know, not only the people, but every one is\r\ndeeply indignant and disgusted with the consequences of this unfortunate\r\nwar. It is commented upon everywhere in the selfsame spirit. They say it\r\nis the fault of ----\"\r\n\r\n\"The fault of whom?\" repeated Napoléon.\r\n\r\nWhereupon M. Hyrvoix kept silent once more.\r\n\r\n\"The fault of whom?\" insisted Napoléon.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" stammered M. Hyrvoix, \"in the time of Louis XVI. people said,\r\n'It is the fault of the Austrian woman.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under Napoléon III. people say, 'It is the fault of the Spanish\r\nwoman.'\"\r\n\r\nThe words had scarcely left M. Hyrvoix' lips, when a door leading to the\r\ninner apartments opened, and the Empress appeared on the threshold. \"She\r\nlooked like a beautiful fury,\" said M. Hyrvoix to his friend, from whom\r\nI have got the story. \"She wore a white dressing-gown, her hair was\r\nwaving on her shoulders, and her eyes shot flames. She hissed, rather\r\nthan spoke, as she bounded towards me; and, ridiculous as it may seem, I\r\nfelt afraid for the moment. 'You will please repeat what you said just\r\nnow, M. Hyrvoix,' she gasped in a voice hoarse with anger.\r\n\r\n\"'Certainly, madame,' I replied, 'seeing that I am here to speak the\r\ntruth, and, as such, your Majesty will pardon me. I told the Emperor\r\nthat the Parisians spoke of \"the Spanish woman,\" as they spoke\r\nseventy-five and eighty years ago of the Austrian woman.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'The Spanish woman! the Spanish woman!' she jerked out three or four\r\ntimes--and I could see that her hands were clenched;--'I have become\r\nFrench, but I will show my enemies that I can be Spanish when occasion\r\ndemands it.'\r\n\r\n\"With this she left as suddenly as she had come, taking no notice of the\r\nEmperor's uplifted hand to detain her. When the door closed upon her, I\r\nsaid to the Emperor, 'I am more than grieved, sire, that I spoke.'\r\n\r\n\"'You did your duty,' he said, grasping my hand.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, the threat to show her enemies that she could be\r\nSpanish when occasion required was, in this instance, an empty one,\r\nbecause \"the enemies\" happened to be legion. A scapegoat was found,\r\nhowever, in the honest functionary who had, in the exercise of his duty,\r\nfrankly warned the Emperor of the ugly things that were said about her.\r\nNext morning, M. Hyrvoix was appointed Receiver-General for one of the\r\ndepartments--that is, exiled to the provinces.\r\n\r\nThis system of ostracism was indiscriminately applied to all who\r\nhappened to offend her. Unfortunately, the slightest divergence of\r\nopinion on the most trifling matter was construed into an offence; hence\r\nin a few years the so-called counsellors around the Emperor were simply\r\nso many automata, moving at her will, and at her will only. Men who\r\nventured to think for themselves were removed, or else voluntarily\r\nretired from the precincts of the court sooner than submit to a tyranny,\r\nnot based like that of Catherine II. or Elizabeth upon great\r\nintellectual gifts, but upon the wayward impulses of a woman in no way\r\ndistinguished mentally from the meanest of her sex, except by an\r\noverweening ambition and an equally overweening conceit.\r\n\r\nAnd as nothing is so apt to breed injustice as injustice, men, who might\r\nhave proved the salvation of the Second Empire in its hour of direst\r\nneed, were absolutely driven into opposition, and so blinded by\r\nresentment as to be unable to distinguish any longer between France and\r\nthose who impelled her to her ruin.\r\n\r\nLest I should be taxed with exaggeration, a few instances among the many\r\nwill suffice. One evening, in the course of those charades of which I\r\nhave already spoken, some of the performers, both men and women, had\r\nthrown all decorum to the winds in their improvised dialogue. A young\r\ncolonel, by no means strait-laced or a hypocrite, who was a great\r\nfavourite with the Emperor and Empress, professed himself shocked, in\r\nthe hearing of the latter, at so much licence in the presence of the\r\nsovereigns. In reality, it was an honest but indirect comment upon the\r\nEmpress's blamable latitude in that respect. The Empress took up the\r\ncudgels for the offenders. \"Vous n'êtes pas content, colonel; hé bien!\r\nje m'en _fiche_, _refiche_ et _contrefiche_.\" (\"You don't like it,\r\ncolonel; well, I don't care a snap, nor two snaps, nor a thousand\r\nsnaps.\"[72]) The Emperor laughed, and applauded his Consort; the colonel\r\ntook the hint, and was seen at court no more. Shortly afterward he went\r\nto Mexico, where all who saw him at work concurred in saying that he was\r\nnot only a most valuable soldier, but probably the only one in the\r\nFrench army, of those days, capable of handling large masses.\r\nNevertheless, when the war of '70 broke out, he was still a colonel, and\r\nno attempt at offering him a command was made. The republicans, for once\r\nin a way, were wiser in their generation: at this hour he holds a high\r\nposition in the army, and is destined to occupy a still higher. It was\r\nhe who counselled Bazaine, in the beginning of the investment of Metz,\r\nto leave twenty or thirty thousand men behind to defend the fortress,\r\nand to break through with the rest. According to the best authorities of\r\nthe German general staff, the advice, had it been followed, would have\r\nmaterially altered the state of affairs. It is not my intention to\r\nenlarge upon that soldier's career or capabilities; I have merely\r\nmentioned them to show that, when her resentment was roused, Eugénie\r\nthrew all considerations for the welfare of France to the winds, and\r\nsystematically ostracized men, whatever their merits; for I may add that\r\nthe young colonel, at the time of the scene described above, was known\r\nto be one of the ablest of strategists.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 72: My translation by no means renders the vulgarity\r\n         of the sentence. The French have three words to express their\r\n         contempt for a speaker's opinion, _se moquer_, _se ficher_, and\r\n         _se_ ... I omit the latter, but even the second is rarely used\r\n         in decent society.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nWe have heard a great deal of the Empress's charity. Truth to tell, that\r\ncharity was often as indiscriminate as her anger; it was sporadic,\r\nlargely admixed with the histrionic element, not unfrequently prompted\r\nby sentimentalism rather than by sentiment; and woe to him or to her who\r\nventured to hint that it, the charity, was misplaced. In those days\r\nthere was a prefect of police, M. Boitelle. He was a worthy man, endowed\r\nwith a great deal of common sense, and, above all, honest to a degree.\r\nBelonging to the middle classes, he was free from the vulgar greed that\r\nso often distinguishes them in France; and, after leaving the army as a\r\nnon-commissioned officer, had settled on a small farm left to him by his\r\nparents. Now, it so happened that M. de Persigny, whose real name was\r\nFialin, had been a sergeant in the same regiment, and one day, after the\r\nadvent of the Empire, being in the north, went to pay his former comrade\r\na visit. I am perfectly certain that M. Boitelle, whom I knew, and with\r\nwhose son I have continued the amicable relations subsisting between his\r\nfather and myself, did not solicit any honours or appointment from the\r\nthen powerful friend of the Emperor; nevertheless, Persigny appointed\r\nhis fellow-messmate to the sub-prefectorship of St. Quentin. The\r\nemoluments, even in those days, were not large, but M. Boitelle was only\r\na small farmer, and the promise of quick preferment may have induced\r\nhim to leave his peaceful homestead; in short, M. Boitelle accepted,\r\nand, after several promotions, found himself at last at the Paris\r\nPrefecture of Police. In this instance the choice was really a good one.\r\nI have known a good many prefects of police, among others M. de Maupas,\r\nwho officiated on the night of the Coup d'État, and who was also a\r\npersonal friend; but I never knew one so thoroughly fitted for the\r\narduous post as M. Boitelle. Though not a man of vast reading or\r\nbrilliant education, he was essentially a man of the world in the best\r\nsense of the word. He was not a martinet, but a capable disciplinarian,\r\nand, what was better still, endowed with a feeling of great tolerance\r\nfor the foibles of modern society. The soldier and the philosopher were\r\nso inextricably mixed up in him, that it would have been difficult to\r\nsay where the one ended and the other began. M. de Maupas was at times\r\ntoo conscious of his own importance; there was too much of the French\r\nofficial in him. His successful co-operation in the Coup d'État had\r\nimbued him with an exaggerated notion of his own capabilities of \"taking\r\npeople by the scruff of the neck and running them in\" (à empoigner les\r\ngens). An English friend of mine, to whom I introduced him, summed him\r\nup, perhaps, more fitly. \"He is like the policeman who ran in a woman of\r\nsixty all by himself, and boasted that he could have done it if she had\r\nbeen eighty.\"\r\n\r\nBut M. Boitelle, though kind-hearted, had no sympathy whatsoever with\r\nmawkish philanthropy. The Empress, on the other hand, had absolute\r\nparoxysms of it. She was like the Spanish high-born dame who insisted\r\nupon a tombstone for the grave of a bull, the killing and torturing of\r\nwhich in the ring she had frantically applauded. One day she expressed\r\nher wish to M. Boitelle to pay a visit to Saint-Lazare. There is nothing\r\nanalogous to that institution in England. The \"unfortunate woman\" who\r\nprowls about the streets before or after nightfall is--except in a few\r\ngarrison towns--tacitly ignored by our legislators, and when she offends\r\nagainst the common law, treated by our magistrates like any other member\r\nof society. We have no establishments where the moral cancer eats deeper\r\ninto the flesh and the mind by the very attempt to isolate those who\r\nsuffer most from it; we have no system which virtually bars the way to a\r\nreformed life by having given official authority to sin, and by\r\nrecording for evermore the names of those whom want alone compelled to\r\nhave themselves inscribed as outcasts on those hellish registers. We\r\nhave no Saint-Lazare, and Heaven be praised for it!\r\n\r\nM. Boitelle knew the moral and mental state of most of the inmates of\r\nSaint-Lazare sufficiently well to foster no illusions with regard to the\r\nbenefit to be derived by them from the solitary visit of so exalted a\r\npersonage, while, on the other hand, he felt perfectly aware that it was\r\nmorbid curiosity, however well disguised, that prompted the step. At the\r\nsame time, the respect due to his sovereign made him reluctant to expose\r\nher, needlessly, to a possible, if not to a probable insult; in short,\r\nhe considered the projected \"tour of inspection\" an ill-concerted one.\r\nHe also knew that it would be idle to bring his fund of shrewd\r\nphilosophy to bear upon the Empress, to make her relinquish her design,\r\nso he adopted instead the outspoken method of the soldier. \"Whatever\r\nyour charitable feelings may be for those who suffer, madame,\" he said,\r\n\"your place is not among them.\" The words sound a shade more abrupt in\r\nFrench, but a moment's reflection would have shown the most fastidious\r\nlady that no offence on the speaker's part was intended. The Empress,\r\nhowever, drew herself up to her full height. \"Charity can go any and\r\neverywhere, monsieur,\" she replied. \"You will please take me to\r\nSaint-Lazare to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nI would fain say as little as possible about the occupants of that\r\ngloomy building at the top of the Faubourg St. Denis, but am compelled\r\nto state in common fairness that, when once they are incarcerated and\r\nbehave themselves--of course, according to _their_ lights--they are not\r\ntreated with unnecessary harshness. I will go further, and say that they\r\nare treated more leniently than female prisoners in other penal\r\nestablishments. The milder method is due to the presence in greater\r\nnumbers than elsewhere of that admirable angel of patience, the Sister\r\nof Charity, who has no private grievances to avenge upon her own sex,\r\nwho does not look upon the fallen woman as an erstwhile and unsuccessful\r\nrival for the favours of men, who consequently does not apply the _væ\r\nvictis_, either by sign, deed, or word. During my long stay in Paris, I\r\nhave been allowed to visit Saint-Lazare twice, and I can honestly say\r\nthat, though the laws that relegate these women there are a disgrace to\r\nnineteenth-century civilization, their application inside Saint-Lazare\r\nis not at all brutal. This does not imply that they lie upon down beds,\r\nand that their food is of the most delicate description; but they are\r\nwell cared for bodily. The Empress, however, in a gush of misplaced\r\ncharity, thought fit to take objection to their daily meals not being\r\nconcluded with dessert. Thereupon, M. Boitelle, whose sound common sense\r\nhad already been severely tried during that morning, could not help\r\nsmiling. \"Really, madame,\" he said; \"you allow your kindness to run away\r\nwith your good sense. If they are to have a dessert, what are we to give\r\nto honest women?\"\r\n\r\nNext day, M. Boitelle was appointed a senator; that is, removed from his\r\npost as prefect of police, which he had so worthily filled, and where he\r\nhad done a great deal of unostentatious good. The next time M. Boitelle\r\ncame in contact with the Empress was at the last hour of the Empire,\r\nwhen he tried, but in vain, to overcome her resentment, caused by his\r\nunhappy speech of many years before.\r\n\r\nYet the woman who could indulge in sentiment about the absence of\r\ndessert in the Saint-Lazare refectory, would, at the end of the hunt,\r\ndeliberately jump off her horse, plunge the gleaming knife in the throat\r\nof the panting stag, and revel in the sight of blood. Many who saw her\r\ndo this argued that in the hour of danger she would as boldly face the\r\nenemies of herself and her dynasty. I need not say that they were\r\nutterly mistaken. She slunk away at the supreme hour; while the\r\nprincess, whom she had presumed to teach the manners of a court, left\r\nlike a princess in an open landau, preceded by an outrider. I am\r\nalluding to Princess Clotilde.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n     The story of a celebrated sculptor and his model -- David\r\n     d'Angers at the funeral of Cortot, the sculptor -- How I became\r\n     acquainted with him -- The sculptor leaves the funeral procession\r\n     to speak to a woman -- He tells me the story -- David d'Angers'\r\n     sympathy with Greece in her struggle for independence -- When\r\n     Botzaris falls at Missolonghi, he makes up his mind to carve his\r\n     monument -- Wishes to do something original -- He finds his idea\r\n     in the cemetery of Père-la-Chaise -- In search of a model --\r\n     Comes unexpectedly upon her in the Rue du Montparnasse, while in\r\n     company of Victor Hugo -- The model and her mother -- The bronze\r\n     Christ on the studio wall -- David gives it to his model -- The\r\n     latter dismissed -- A plot against the sculptor's life -- His\r\n     model saves him -- He tries to find her and fails -- Only meets\r\n     with her when walking behind the hearse of Cortot -- She appears\r\n     utterly destitute -- Loses sight of her again -- Meets her on the\r\n     outer boulevards with a nondescript of the worst character -- He\r\n     endeavours to rescue her, but fails -- Canler, of the Paris\r\n     police, reveals the tactics pursued with regard to \"unfortunates\"\r\n     -- David's exile and death -- The Botzaris Monument is brought\r\n     back to Paris to be restored -- The model at the door of the\r\n     exhibition -- Her death.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the treatment of \"fallen women\" in Paris, I may give\r\nthe following story, which becomes interesting in virtue of the\r\npersonality of one of the actors. In 1843 the sculptor Cortot died, and\r\nI followed his funeral on foot, as was the custom in those days. I\r\nwalked by the side of one of the greatest artists France, or, for that\r\nmatter, the world, has ever produced--David d'Angers. The name of his\r\nnative town was adopted to distinguish him from his celebrated namesake,\r\nthe painter. I had become acquainted with the great sculptor a\r\ntwelvemonth previously, in Delacroix's studio. All at once, as the\r\nprocession went along the Quai Malaquais, I saw him start violently, and\r\nbreak through what, for want of a more appropriate term, I must call the\r\nranks of mourners. For a moment only; the next, he was back by my side:\r\nbut I noticed that he was frightfully agitated. He probably saw my\r\nconcern for him in my face, for, though I asked him no questions, he\r\nsaid of his own accord, \"It is all right. I just caught sight of a woman\r\nwho saved my life, and, by the looks of her, she is in great straits,\r\nbut, by the time I got out of the crowd, she had disappeared. I have an\r\nidea of the errand she was bent upon, and will inquire to-morrow, but I\r\nam afraid it will be of very little use.\"\r\n\r\nI kept silent for a moment or two, but my curiosity was aroused, for, I\r\nrepeat, at that time, the artistic world was ringing with the name of\r\nDavid d'Angers.\r\n\r\n\"I did not know you had been in such great danger,\" I said at last.\r\n\r\n\"Very few people do know it,\" he replied sadly; \"besides, it happened a\r\ngood many years ago, when you were very young. The next time we meet I\r\nwill tell you all about it.\"\r\n\r\nA week or so afterwards, as I was leaving the Café de Paris one evening,\r\nand going to the tobacconist at the corner of the Rue Laffite, I ran\r\nagainst the celebrated sculptor. The weather was mild, and we sat\r\noutside Tortoni's, where he told me the story, part of which I give in\r\nhis own words, as far as I can remember them after the lapse of more\r\nthan forty years.\r\n\r\n\"If there were any need,\" he began, \"to apologize to an Englishman for\r\nmy sympathy with the Philhellenism which shortened the life of Byron, I\r\nmight say that I sucked the principle of the independence of nations\r\nwith the mother's milk, for I was born in 1789. Be that as it may, when\r\nMarcos Botzaris fell at Missolonghi I felt determined that he should\r\nhave a monument worthy of his heroism and patriotism, as far as my\r\ntalents could contribute to it. I was sufficiently young to be\r\nenthusiastic, and, at the same time, sufficiently presumptuous to\r\nimagine that I could do something which had never been done before. You\r\nhave seen the engraving of the monument; you may judge for yourself how\r\nfar I succeeded. But the idea of the composition, however out of the\r\ncommon, was, I am bound to admit, not the offspring of my own\r\nimagination. I was, perhaps, clever enough to see the poesy of it when\r\npresented to me, and to appropriate it; but the young, fragile girl\r\nlying on the tombstone and tracing the name of Marcos Botzaris was\r\nsuggested to me by a scene I witnessed one day at Père-la-Chaise. I saw\r\na child stooping over a gravestone, and trying to spell out the words\r\ncarved on it. It was all I wanted. I own, from that moment, my\r\ncomposition took shape in my mind. I was, however, still at a loss where\r\nto find the ideal child. The little girl of whom I had caught a glimpse\r\nwould not have done at all for my purpose, even if her parents would\r\nhave consented to let her sit, which was not at all likely--she was the\r\nprosperous-looking demoiselle of a probably prosperous bourgeoise\r\nfamily, well-fed, plump, and not above seven or eight. I, on the\r\ncontrary, wanted a girl double that age just budding into womanhood, but\r\nwith the travail of the transition expressed in every feature, in every\r\nlimb. She was to represent to the most casual observer the sufferings\r\nengendered by the struggle against tutelage for freedom. She was to bend\r\nover the tomb of Botzaris to drag the secret of that freedom from him.\r\nDawning life was to drag the secret from the dead.\r\n\r\n\"That was my idea, and for several days I cudgelled my brain to find\r\namong my models one that would, physically and morally, represent all\r\nthis. In vain; the grisettes of the Rue Fleurus and the Quartier-Latin,\r\nin spite of all that has been said of them by the poets and novelists of\r\nthat time, were not at all the visible incarnations of lofty sentiment;\r\nwhatever pain and grief an unrequited romantic passion might entail,\r\nthey left no appreciable traces on their complexions or in their\r\noutline; they were saucy madams, and looked it. I had communicated my\r\nwants to some of my friends, and one of them sent me what he thought\r\nwould suit. The face was certainly a very beautiful one, as an\r\nabsolutely perfect ensemble of classical features I have never seen the\r\nlike; but there was about as much expression in it as in my hand, and,\r\nas for the body, it was simply bursting out of its dress. I told her she\r\nwould not do, and the reason why. 'Monsieur can't expect me to go into a\r\nconsumption for two francs fifty an hour,' she remarked, bouncing out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\"I was fast becoming a nuisance to all my cronies, when, one day, going\r\nto dine with Victor Hugo at La Mère Saget's, which was at the Barrière\r\ndu Maine, I came unexpectedly, in the Rue du Montparnasse, upon the very\r\ngirl for which I had been looking out for months. Notwithstanding her\r\nrags, she was simply charming. She was not above fourteen or fifteen,\r\nand, although very tall for her age, she had scarcely any flesh on her\r\nbones. I only knew her Christian name--Clémentine: I doubt whether she\r\nhad any other. Next morning she came with her mother, an old hag,\r\ndissipation and drunkenness written in every line of her face. But the\r\nchild herself was perfectly innocent--at any rate, as innocent as she\r\ncould be with such a parent, and tractable to a degree. After a little\r\nwhile the old woman, tired of twirling her thumbs, disgusted, perhaps,\r\nat my want of hospitality in not offering her refreshments, left off\r\naccompanying her, Clémentine came henceforth alone.\r\n\r\n\"My studio was in the Rue de Fleurus in those days, and on the wall hung\r\na very handsome bronze Christ on a velvet panel and in a dark satin\r\nframe. Curiously enough, I often caught the mother watching it; it\r\nseemed to have an irresistible fascination for her: and, one day, while\r\nthe child was dressing, after two or three hours of hard work, she\r\nsuddenly exclaimed, 'That's why my mother will not come here; she says\r\nshe'd commit a robbery. She never leaves off talking about it. I wonder\r\nwhether you'd like to part with it, M. David? A Christ like that would\r\nbe beautiful in our attic. It would comfort and cheer me. If you like,\r\nI'll buy it of you. Of course, I have no money, but you can deduct it\r\nfrom my sittings. You can have as many as you like, not only for this\r\nstatue, but for any other you may want later on.'\r\n\r\n\"We democrats, professed republicans, and more than suspected\r\nrevolutionaries, are not credited by the majority with a great reverence\r\nfor religious dogma; we are generally branded as absolute freethinkers,\r\nnot to say atheists. This is frequently a mistake.[73] I have no\r\noccasion to recite my _credo_ to you, but a great many of the\r\nrepublicans of '89 and of to-day were and are believers. At any rate, I\r\nfondly imagined that the Christ for which the mother and child were\r\nlonging might exercise some salutary influence on their lives, so I\r\nsimply took down the frame and its contents and handed them to her. She\r\nstaggered under the weight. 'You want that Christ,' I said; 'here it is:\r\nand when you are tempted to do evil look at it, and think of me, who\r\ngave it you as a present.'\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 73: It is a mistake. Not to mention Camille\r\n         Desmoulins, who, when asked his age by his judge, replied, \"The\r\n         age of another _sans-culotte_, Jesus.\" Esquiros frequently\r\n         spoke of \"that good patriot, Christ;\" Lammenais began the draft\r\n         of his constitution with \"In the name of the Father, the Son,\r\n         and the Holy Ghost, and by the will of the French\r\n         people.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"'As a present?' she shrieked for joy; and hurried away as fast as her\r\nlegs would carry her.\r\n\r\n\"In about six months from that day the statue was finished. I had no\r\nfurther need of Clémentine's services, and gradually all thought of her\r\nslipped from my mind. You may have heard that some time after my work\r\nwas despatched to Greece, I was assaulted one night in the Rue\r\nChildebert, on my way to Gérard de Nerval's. My skull was split open in\r\ntwo places, I was left for dead in the street, and but for a workman who\r\nstumbled over me, took me home, and sat up with me until morning, I\r\nmight not have lived to tell the tale. From the very first I suspected\r\nthe identity of my assailant, though I have never breathed his name to\r\nany one. I am glad to say I never had many enemies, nor have I now, as\r\nfar as I am aware; but I had offended the man by withholding my vote in\r\na prize competition. He was, however, not responsible for his actions;\r\nfor even at that time he must have been mad. A few years afterwards, the\r\nsuspicion both of his madness and his attempt upon my life became a\r\ncertainty, for he repeated the latter. You are very young, and youth is\r\neither very credulous or very sceptical. We should be neither. If what I\r\nam going to tell you now were to be represented to you at the Ambigu or\r\nPorte Saint-Martin, you, as an educated man, would shrug your shoulders,\r\nand look with a kind of good-natured contempt upon the grisette or\r\nworkman or bourgeois who would sit spellbound and take it all in as so\r\nmuch gospel. Providence, fate, call it what you will, concocts more\r\nstriking dramatic situations and a greater number of them than M. Scribe\r\nand all his compeers have constructed in the course of their\r\nprofessional careers. Listen, and you shall judge for yourself.\r\n\r\n\"About seven years after the attack in the Rue Childebert, I received a\r\nletter one morning, inviting me to attend a meeting that same night\r\nbetween twelve and one, at a house in the Faubourg Saint-Jacques, near\r\nthe hospital of the Val-de-Grace. The letter told me how to proceed.\r\nThere being no concierge in the house, I was to provide myself with a\r\n'dark lantern,' and to go up four flights of stairs, where I should find\r\na door with a cross chalked upon it. It would be opened by my giving a\r\nparticular knock. My previous danger notwithstanding, I had not the\r\nleast suspicion of this being a trap. I did not for one moment connect\r\nthe letter with the other event, the recollection of which, strange as\r\nit may seem to you, did not obtrude itself at all then. But there was\r\nanother reason for the absence of caution on my part. In one of its\r\ncorners the letter bore a sign, not exactly that of a secret society,\r\nbut agreed upon among certain patriots.\r\n\r\n\"In short, a little before twelve o'clock that night, I went to the\r\nplace appointed. I had no difficulty in finding the house, and reached\r\nthe fourth story without meeting a soul. There was the door, with the\r\ncross chalked on it. I knocked once, twice, without receiving an answer.\r\nStill, the thought of evil never entered my head. I began to think that\r\nI had been the victim of a hoax of some youngsters of the École des\r\nBeaux-Arts, most of whom were aware of my political opinions. I was just\r\nturning round to go down again, when a door by the side of that\r\nindicated was slowly opened, and a young girl with a lighted candle\r\nappeared on the threshold. Though both the candle and my lantern did not\r\nshed much light, I perceived that, at the sight of me, she turned very\r\npale, but, until she spoke, I failed to recognize her. Then I saw it was\r\nClémentine, my model. She scarcely gave me time to speak. 'It is you, M.\r\nDavid,' she said, in a voice trembling with fear and emotion. 'You,' she\r\nrepeated. 'For Heaven's sake, go!--go as quickly as you can! If you stay\r\nanother moment, you will be a corpse; for God's sake, go! And let me beg\r\nof you not to breathe a word of this to any one; if you do, my mother\r\nand I will pay for this with our lives. For God's sake, go. I did not\r\nknow that you were the person expected. Go--go!'\r\n\r\n\"I do not think I answered a single word. I felt instinctively that this\r\nwas no hoax, as I had imagined, but terrible reality. I went downstairs\r\nas fast as I could, but it was not until I got into the street that a\r\nconnection between the two events presented itself to me. Then I decided\r\nto wait and watch. I hid myself in the doorway of a house a few steps\r\naway. Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed when half a dozen individuals\r\narrived, one by one, and disappeared into the house that sheltered\r\nClémentine and her mother. One of them, I feel sure, was the man whom I\r\nsuspected of having attempted my life before. A few years more went by,\r\nduring which I often thought of my former model; and then, one day, I\r\nfelt I would like to see her again. In plain daylight this time, I\r\nrepaired to the house of the Faubourg Saint-Jacques, clambered up the\r\nstairs, and knocked at the door I had such good cause to remember. The\r\ndoor was opened by a workman, and a rapid glance at the inside of the\r\nroom showed me that he was a lastmaker. 'Mademoiselle Clémentine?' I\r\nasked. The man stared at me, and said, 'No such person lives here.' I\r\nmade inquiries on all the lower floors--nobody had ever heard of her.\r\nClémentine had disappeared. I never saw her again until a few days ago,\r\nwhen I walked by your side behind the body of Cortot. I should not have\r\nrecognized her but for the bronze Christ she carried under her arm, and\r\nwhich attracted my notice. If what I surmise be correct, she must have\r\nreached the last stage of misery; for I feel convinced that nothing but\r\nabsolute want would make her part with it. I have, however, failed to\r\ntrace it in any of the bric-à-brac shops on the quays, and I believe\r\nthat I have pretty well inquired at every one; so I must fain be content\r\nuntil fate throws her again across my path.\"\r\n\r\nSo far the story as told by the great sculptor himself. During the next\r\neight years, in fact up to the Coup d'État, I met him frequently, and,\r\ncuriously enough, rarely failed to inquire whether in his many\r\nwanderings through Paris he had caught a glimpse of his former model. I\r\nfelt unaccountably interested in the fate of that woman whom I had never\r\nseen, and, if we had been able to find her, would have endeavoured to\r\nfind a decent home for her. But for about three years my inquiries\r\nalways met with the same answer. Then, one evening in the latter end of\r\n'46 or beginning of '47, David told me that he had met her on the outer\r\nboulevards, arm in arm with one of those terrible nondescripts of which\r\none is often compelled to speak again and again, and which, as far as I\r\nam aware, are nowhere to be found as a class except in the French\r\nmetropolis and great provincial centres. Clémentine evidently wished to\r\navoid David. A little while after, he met her again, and this time\r\nfollowed her, but, though by no means a coward, lacked the courage to\r\nenter the hovel into which she had disappeared with her companion. The\r\nlast time he saw her was in the middle of '47, in the Rue des\r\nBoucheries. She seemed to have returned to her old quarters, and she was\r\nby herself. Until she spoke, David did not recognize her. Her face was\r\npositively seamed with horrible scars, \"wounds inflicted by her\r\nlovers\"--Heaven save the mark! She asked him to help her, and he did;\r\nbut she had scarcely gone a few steps when she was arrested and taken to\r\nthe prison of l'Abbaye de St. Germain, hard by, whither David followed\r\nto intercede for her. He was told to come back next morning, and that\r\nsame evening communicated the affair to me. I decided there and then to\r\naccompany him, in order to carry out my plan of redeeming that human\r\nsoul if possible. I failed, though through no fault of my own, but my\r\nattempt brought me in contact with a personage scarcely less interesting\r\nin his own way than David, namely, M. Canler, the future head of the\r\nParis detective force. It was through him that I got an insight into\r\nsome of the most revolting features of criminal life in Paris. But,\r\nbefore dealing with that subject, I wish to devote a few more lines to\r\nDavid, whom I had the honour of numbering among my friends till the day\r\nof his death, albeit that the last few years of his life were spent away\r\nfrom France, whither he returned, however, to die in '56. After the Coup\r\nd'État he was exiled by Louis-Napoléon--ostensibly, for his political\r\nopinions; in reality, because he had refused to finish the monument for\r\nQueen Hortense's tomb after her son's fiasco at Boulogne.\r\n\r\nWriting about France and Frenchmen, I feel somewhat reluctant to make\r\ntoo lavish a use of the words \"patriot\" and \"patriotism,\" especially\r\nwith the patriots and the patriotism of the Third Republic around me.\r\nBut I have no hesitation in saying that, to David d'Angers, these words\r\nmeant something almost sacred. Sprung from exceedingly poor parents, he\r\nhad amassed, by honest work, a fortune which, to men born in a higher\r\nsphere and with far more expensive tastes, might seem sufficient. Seeing\r\nthat he was frugality and simplicity personified, that his income was\r\nmainly spent in alleviating distress, and that his daughter was even\r\nmore simple-minded than her father, he had nothing to gain by the advent\r\nof a republic, nothing to lose by the establishment of a monarchy or\r\nempire, and his ardent championship of republican institutions--such as\r\nhe conceived them--was prompted solely by his noble nature. That\r\nLouis-Napoléon should have exiled such a man was an error his warmest\r\nfriends could scarcely forgive him. But David never complained, any more\r\nthan he ever uttered a harsh word against the memory of Flaxman, who, in\r\nhis youth, had shut his doors against him under the impression that he\r\nwas a relation of Louis David who had voted for the death of Louis XVI.\r\nOn the contrary, the memory of the great English sculptor was held in\r\ndeep reverence.\r\n\r\nAnd so David departed, a wanderer on the face of the earth with his\r\ndaughter. He first endeavoured to settle in Brussels, but the\r\nirresistible desire to behold once more what he himself considered his\r\ngreatest work, the monument to Marcos Botzaris, attracted him to Greece.\r\nA friend, to whom he communicated his intention, wrote to him, \"Do not\r\ngo.\" He gave him no further reason; he even withheld from him the fact\r\nthat he had been at Missolonghi a twelvemonth previously. The\r\nexplanation of this reticence may be gathered from David's letter to him\r\na few days after his, David's, return. I have been allowed to copy it,\r\nand give it verbatim.\r\n\r\n\"Long before our vessel anchored near the spot where Byron died, I\r\ncaught a glimpse of the tumulus erected at the foot of the bastion, in\r\nhonour of Botzaris and his fellow-heroes. It made a small dark spot on\r\nthe horizon, and above it was a speck, much smaller and perfectly white.\r\nI knew instinctively that this was my statue of the 'young Greek girl,'\r\nand I watched and watched with bated breath, fancying as the ship sped\r\nalong that the speck moved. Of course, it was only my imagination, the\r\npresumptuous thought that the marble effigy would start into life at the\r\napproach of its creator.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, would I had proceeded no further--that I had been satisfied with\r\nthe mirage instead of pushing on in hot haste towards the reality! For\r\nthe reality was heart-rending, so heart-rending that I wept like a\r\nchild, and clenched my fists like a giant in despair. The right hand of\r\nthe statue, the index finger of which pointed to the name, had been\r\nbroken; the ears had disappeared, one of the feet was broken to atoms,\r\nand the face slashed with knives. It was like the face of the girl that\r\nhad sat for me, when I last saw it, under the circumstances which, you\r\nmay remember, I told you. The whole was riddled with bullets, and some\r\ntourists, British ones probably, had cut their names on the back of the\r\nchild. And so ends the most glorious chapter of my artist's career--the\r\nmodel itself fallen beyond redemption, the work mutilated beyond repair,\r\nthe author of it in exile.\r\n\r\n\"I felt powerless to repair the mischief. I did not stay long. Perhaps I\r\nought not to complain. I knew that Byron had been buried near the\r\nfortifications at Missolonghi, but all my efforts to find the spot have\r\nproved useless.[74] The house where he breathed his last had been pulled\r\ndown. Why should the Greeks have more reverence for Botzaris or\r\nMavrocordato than they had for the poet? and if these three are so\r\nlittle to them, what must I be, whose name they probably never heard?\r\nStill, as I stood at the stern of the departing vessel, I felt\r\nheart-broken. I have no illusions left.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 74: Of course, David meant the spot where the remains\r\n         had been interred at first.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nI firmly believe that the injury done to the statue hastened David's\r\ndeath. His work has since been restored by M. Armand Toussaint, his\r\nfavourite pupil, who gave his promise to that effect a few days before\r\nthe great sculptor breathed his last. The monument was, however, not\r\nbrought to Paris until 1861, and when M. Toussaint had finished his\r\ntask, he invited the press and the friends of his famous master to\r\njudge of the results. It was at the door of his studio that I saw the\r\nwoman, whose adventures I have told in the preceding notes, for the\r\nfirst time. A fortnight later, she died at the hospital of La Charité,\r\nat peace, I trust, with her Maker. \"Fate, Providence, call it what you\r\nwill,\" as David himself would have said, had brought me to the spot\r\njust in time to alleviate the last sufferings of one who, though not\r\naltogether irresponsible for her own errors, was to a still greater\r\nextent the victim of a system so iniquitous as to make the least\r\nserious-minded--provided he be endowed with the faintest spark of\r\nhumanity--shudder. I allude to the system pursued by the Paris\r\ndetective force in their hunt after criminals--a system not altogether\r\nabandoned yet, and the successful carrying out of which is paid for by\r\nthe excruciating tortures inflicted upon defenceless though fallen\r\nwomen--but women still--by the _souteneur_. I refrain from Anglicizing\r\nthe word; it will suggest itself after the perusal of the following\r\nfacts, albeit that, fortunately with us, the creature itself does not\r\nexist as a class, and, what is worse, as a class recognized by those\r\nwhose first and foremost duty it should be to destroy him root and\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe morning after Clémentine's arrest, David and I repaired to the\r\nprison of l'Abbaye Saint-German. When the sculptor sent in his name, the\r\ngovernor himself came out to receive us. But the woman was gone; she had\r\nbeen transferred, the previous night, to the dépôt of the préfecture de\r\npolice, \"where,\" he said, \"if you make haste, you will still find her.\"\r\nHe gave us a letter of introduction for the official charged to deal\r\nwith refractory \"filles soumises,\" or offending insoumises, because,\r\nthen as now, these unfortunates were not tried by an ordinary police\r\nmagistrate in open court, but summarily punished by said official, the\r\nsentences being subject, however, to revision or confirmation by his\r\nsuperior, the chief of the municipal police. Nay, the decisions were not\r\neven communicated to these women until they were safely lodged in\r\nSaint-Lazare, lest there should be a disturbance; for they were not\r\nexamined one by one; and, as may be imagined, the contagion of revolt\r\nspread easily among those hysterical and benighted creatures.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the préfecture de police the judging was over, but, on\r\nour sending in our letter, we were admitted at once to the official's\r\nroom. After David's description, he remembered the woman, and told us at\r\nonce that she had not been sent to Saint-Lazare, but liberated. Some one\r\nhad interceded for her--no less a personage than Canler, who, though at\r\nthe time but a superintendent, was already fast springing into notice as\r\na detective of no mean skill. \"What had he done with her?\" was David's\r\nquestion. \"I could not tell you,\" was the courteous reply; \"but I will\r\ngive you his address, and he will no doubt give you all the information\r\nin his power and consistent with his duty.\" With this we were bowed out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nWe did not succeed in seeing Canler until two days afterwards, or,\r\nrather, on the evening of the second day; for, at that period, he was\r\nentrusted with the surveillance of the theatres on the Boulevard du\r\nTemple. I may have occasion to speak of him again, so I need not give\r\nhis portrait here. He was about fifty, and, unlike one of his\r\nsuccessors, M. Claude, the type of the old soldier. Of his honesty there\r\nnever was, there could have never been, a doubt, nor was his\r\nintelligence ever questioned. And yet, this very honest, intelligent\r\nman, in his all-absorbing pursuit, the detection and chasing of\r\ncriminals, was sufficiently dishonest and unintelligent to foster, if\r\nnot to inaugurate, a system subversive of all morality.\r\n\r\nDavid's name was a passport everywhere, and, no sooner had it been sent\r\nin, than Canler came out to him. The sculptor stated his business, and\r\nthe police officer made a wry face. \"I am afraid, M. David, I cannot\r\nhelp you in this instance. To speak plainly, I have restored her to her\r\nsouteneur.\" We both opened our eyes very wide. \"Yes,\" came the remark,\r\n\"I know what you are going to say. I can sum up all your objections\r\nbefore you utter them. But I could not help myself; the fellow rendered\r\nme a service, and this was the price of it. Without his aid, one of the\r\nmost desperate burglars in Paris would still be at large. As it is, I\r\nhave got him safe under lock and key. Very shocking, no doubt; mais, à\r\nla guerre comme à la guerre.\" Then, seeing that we did not answer, he\r\ncontinued: \"As a rule, I do not explain my tactics to everybody; but\r\nyou, M. David, are not everybody, and, if you like to meet me when the\r\ntheatre is over, I shall be pleased to have a chat with you.\"\r\n\r\nAt half-past twelve that night we were seated at a restaurant near the\r\nPorte Saint-Martin, and, after a few preliminary remarks, Canler\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nHowever great an artist you may be, M. David, you could not produce a\r\nstatue without the outlay for the marble, or for the casting of it in\r\nbronze. You, moreover, want to pay your _praticien_, who does the rough\r\nwork for you. Our _praticiens_ are the informers, and they want to be\r\npaid like the most honest workmen. The detection of crime means, no\r\ndoubt, intelligence, but it means also money. Now, money is the very\r\nthing I have not got, and yet, when I accepted the functions I am at\r\npresent fulfilling, I gave my promise to M. Delessert not to neglect the\r\ndetective part of the business. I wish to keep my word, first of all,\r\nbecause I pledged it; secondly, because detection of crime is food and\r\ndrink to me; thirdly, because I hope to be the head of the Paris\r\ndetective force one day. The Government allows a ridiculously small sum\r\nevery year for distribution among informers, and rewards among their own\r\nagents; it is something over thirty thousand francs, but not a sou of\r\nwhich ever reached my hands when I accepted my present appointment, and\r\nscarcely a sou of which reaches me now. I was, therefore, obliged to\r\nlook out for auxiliaries, sufficiently disinterested to assist me\r\ngratuitously, but, knowing that absolute disinterestedness is very rare\r\nindeed, I looked for my collaborateurs among the very ones I was charged\r\nto watch, but who, in exchange for my protection in the event of their\r\noffending, were ready to peach upon their companions in crime and in\r\nvice. I need not trouble you by enumerating the various categories of my\r\nallies, but the souteneur, the most abject of them all, is, perhaps, the\r\nmost valuable.\r\n\r\n\"He is too lazy to work, and, as a rule, has not got the pluck of a\r\nmouse, consequently he rarely resorts to crime, requiring the smallest\r\namount of energy or daring. He furthermore loves his Paris, where,\r\naccording to his own lights, he enjoys himself and lives upon the fat of\r\nthe land; all these reasons make him careful not to commit himself,\r\nalbeit that at every minute of the day he comes in contact with\r\neverything that is vile. But he gets hold of their secrets, though the\r\nword is almost a misnomer, seeing that few of these desperadoes can hold\r\ntheir tongue about their own business, knowing all the while, as they\r\nmust do, that their want of reticence virtually puts their heads into\r\nthe halter. But if they have done 'a good stroke of business,' even if\r\nthey do not brag about it in so many words, they must show their success\r\nby their sudden show of finery, by their treating of everybody all\r\nround, etc. The souteneur is, as it were, jealous of all this; for\r\nthough he lives in comparative comfort from what his mistress gives him,\r\nhe rarely makes a big haul. His mistress gone, the pot ceases to boil;\r\nin fact, he calls her his _marmite_. In a few days he is on his beams'\r\nends, unless he has one in every different quarter, which is not often\r\nthe case, though it happens now and then. But, at any rate, the\r\nincarceration of one of them makes a difference, and, under the\r\ncircumstance, he repairs, as far as he dares, to the préfecture, and\r\nobtains her liberation in exchange for the address of a burglar or even\r\na murderer who is wanted. I have known one who had perfected his system\r\nof obtaining information to such a degree as to be able to sell his\r\nsecrets to his fellow-souteneurs when they had none of their own\r\nwherewith to propitiate the detectives. He has had as much as three or\r\nfour hundred francs for one revelation of that kind, which means twenty\r\nor thirty times the sum the police would have awarded him. Of course,\r\nthree or four hundred francs is a big sum for the souteneur to shell\r\nout; but, when the marmite is a good one, he sooner does that than be\r\ndeprived of his revenues for six months or so. I have diverted some of\r\nthose secrets into my own channel, and Clémentine's souteneur is one of\r\nmy clients; that is why I gave her up. Very shocking, gentlemen, but à\r\nla guerre comme à la guerre.\"\r\n\r\nM. Canler furthermore counselled us to leave Clémentine alone. He\r\npositively refused to give us any information as to her whereabouts;\r\nthat is why I did not meet with her until five years after David's\r\ndeath, too late to be of any use to her in this world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n     Queen Victoria in Paris -- The beginning of the era of\r\n     middle-class excursions -- English visitors before that -- The\r\n     British tourist of 1855 -- The real revenge of Waterloo -- The\r\n     Englishman's French and the Frenchman's English -- The opening of\r\n     the Exhibition -- The lord mayor and aldermen in Paris -- The\r\n     King of Portugal -- All these considered so much \"small fry\" --\r\n     Napoléon III. goes to Boulogne to welcome the Queen -- The royal\r\n     yacht is delayed -- The French hotel proprietor the greatest\r\n     artist in fleecing -- The Italian, the Swiss, the German, mere\r\n     bunglers in comparison -- Napoléon III. before the arrival of the\r\n     Queen -- Pondering the past -- Arrival of the Queen -- The Queen\r\n     lands, followed by Prince Albert and the royal children -- The\r\n     Emperor rides by the side of her carriage -- Comments of the\r\n     population -- An old salt on the situation -- An old soldier's\r\n     retort -- The general feeling -- Arrival in Paris -- The\r\n     Parisians' reception of the Queen -- A description of the route\r\n     -- The apartments of the Queen at St. Cloud -- How the Queen\r\n     spent Sunday -- Visits the art section of the Exhibition on\r\n     Monday -- Ingres and Horace Vernet presented to her --\r\n     Frenchmen's ignorance of English art in those days -- English and\r\n     French art critics -- The Queen takes a carriage drive through\r\n     Paris -- Not a single cry of \"Vive l'Angleterre!\" a great many of\r\n     \"Vive la Reine\" -- England making a cats-paw of France --\r\n     Deception at the Élysée-Bourbon -- \"Les Demoiselles de Saint-Cyr\"\r\n     at St. Cloud -- Alexandre Dumas would have liked to see the Queen\r\n     -- Visit to Versailles -- State-performances at the Opéra -- Ball\r\n     at the Hôtel de Ville -- The Queen's dancing -- Canrobert on \"the\r\n     Queen's dancing and her soldiers' fighting\" -- Another visit to\r\n     the Exhibition -- Béranger misses seeing the Queen -- \"I am not\r\n     going to see the Queen, but the woman\" -- A review in the\r\n     Champ-de-Mars -- A visit to Napoléon's tomb -- Jérôme's absence\r\n     on the plea of illness -- Marshal Vaillant's reply to the Emperor\r\n     when the latter invites him to take Jérôme's place -- His\r\n     comments on the receptions given by the Emperor to foreign\r\n     sovereigns -- Fêtes at Versailles -- Homeward.\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnificent as were the quasi-private entertainments at Compiègne, and\r\nthe more public ones at the Tuileries, they were as nothing to the\r\nseries of fêtes on the occasion of Queen Victoria's visit to Paris, in\r\n1855. For nearly three months before, the capital had assumed the aspect\r\nof a fair. The Exposition Universelle of '55 virtually inaugurated the\r\nera of \"middle-class excursions,\" which since then have assumed such\r\ncolossal proportions, especially with regard to the English. Previous to\r\nthis the development of railways had naturally brought many of our\r\ncountrymen to Paris, but they were of a different class from those who\r\nnow invaded the French metropolis. They were either men of business\r\nbent on business, though not averse to enjoying themselves in the\r\nintervals, or else belonging or pretending to belong to \"the upper ten,\"\r\nand travelling more or less _en grand seigneurs_. They came singly, and\r\nleft their cards at the Embassy, etc. The new visitors came in groups,\r\nthough not necessarily acquainted or travelling with one another; they\r\nknew nothing of the Hôtel Meurice and the Hôtel Bristol or their\r\ntraditions; they crowded the Palais-Royal and its cheap restaurants, and\r\nhad, so to speak, no French at their command. Notwithstanding the\r\nexclamation of the Frenchman when he saw the statue of Wellington\r\nopposite Apsley House, it was then, and then only, that the _revanche_\r\nof Waterloo began. It has lasted ever since. It was '55 that marked the\r\nappearance in the shop-windows of small cards bearing the words,\r\n\"English spoken here.\" Hitherto the English visitor to Paris was\r\ncommonly supposed to have had a French tutor or governess, and though\r\nthe French he or she did speak was somewhat trying to the ear, it was\r\nheavenly music compared to the English the Parisian shopkeeper now held\r\nit incumbent upon himself to \"trot out\" for the benefit of his\r\ncustomers, or that of the guide or valet de place, legions of whom\r\ninfested the streets.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition was opened on the 15th of May, but Queen Victoria was not\r\nexpected until the middle of August. Meanwhile, the Parisians were\r\ntreated to a sight of the Lord Mayor--Sir F. Moon, I believe--and the\r\naldermen, who came in the beginning of June, and who were magnificently\r\nentertained by the Paris municipality, a deputation of which went as far\r\nas Boulogne to welcome them. Still, it was very evident that neither\r\ntheir visit nor that of the King of Portugal and his brother was to tax\r\nthe ingenuity of upholsterers, carpenters, and caterers, or of the\r\nParisians themselves in the matter of decoration; the watchword had\r\napparently been given from the highest quarters to reserve their\r\ngreatest efforts for what Napoléon up till then considered \"the most\r\nglorious event of his reign.\" The Emperor, though he had gone to join\r\nthe Empress, who was by this time known to be enceinte, at Eaux-Bonnes\r\nand Biarritz, returned to Paris at the end of July, and for more than a\r\nfortnight occupied himself personally and incessantly with the smallest\r\ndetails of the Queen's visit, the whole of the programme of which was\r\nsettled by him.\r\n\r\nI was one of the few privileged persons who travelled down to Boulogne\r\nwith Louis-Napoléon, on Friday, the 17th of August, 1855. When we got to\r\nour destination, the yacht was not in sight, but we were already\r\ninformed that, owing to its heavy tonnage, it would not be able to enter\r\nthe harbour except at high tide, which would not be until 1 p.m., on\r\nSaturday. Shortly after that hour the vessel, accompanied by its\r\nflotilla, appeared in the offing; but the Queen remained on board, and\r\nwe had to enjoy ourselves as best we could, which was not difficult,\r\nseeing that the whole of the town was absolutely in the streets, and\r\nthat the latter were decidedly preferable to the stuffy attics at the\r\nhotels, for which we were charged the moderate sum of forty francs each.\r\nUneventful as my life has been, it is only worth recording by reason of\r\nthe celebrity of the persons with whom I have come in contact;\r\nnevertheless, I have travelled a good deal, and been present at a great\r\nmany festive gatherings both in England and on the Continent. Commend me\r\nto the French hotel-proprietor for fleecing you in cold blood. The Swiss\r\nand the Italians, no mean masters of the art, are not in it with him;\r\nand as for the Germans, they are mere 'prentices compared with him. The\r\nItalian despoils you, like his countryman of operatic fame, Fra-Diavolo;\r\nthe Swiss, like an English highwayman of the good old sort; the German,\r\nlike a beggar who picks your pocket while you are looking in your purse\r\nfor a coin to give him; the Frenchman, like the money-lender who is \"not\r\nworking for himself, but for a hard-hearted, relentless principal.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday, the Emperor was astir betimes, and went to the camp\r\noccupied by the troops under the command of Marshal Baraguey-d'Hilliers.\r\nLouis-Napoléon's countenance was at all times difficult to read; I\r\nrepeat, his eyes, like those of others, may have been \"the windows of\r\nhis soul,\" but their blinds were down most of the time. It was only at\r\nrare intervals that the impenetrable features were lighted up by a gleam\r\nfrom within, that the head, which generally inclined to the right,\r\nbecame erect. On that morning, the face was even a greater blank than\r\nusual. And yet that day, even to the fatalist he was, must have seemed a\r\nwonderful one; for the blind goddess of fortune, the \"lucky star\" in\r\nwhich he trusted, had never rewarded a mortal as she had rewarded him. A\r\nfew years previously, during one of his presidential journeys, he had\r\nbeen hailed with enthusiasm at Strasburg, the city in which the scene\r\nof one of his bitterest fiascos had been laid. The contrast between\r\nthose two days was startling indeed: on the one, he was hurried into a\r\npost-chaise as a prisoner to be taken to Paris, with an almost certain\r\nterrible fate overhanging him; on the other, he was greeted as the\r\nsaviour of France, the Imperial Crown was within his grasp. But,\r\nstartling as was this contrast, it could but have been mild compared to\r\nthat which must have presented itself to his mind that autumn morning at\r\nBoulogne, when, a few hours later, the legions--his legions--took up\r\ntheir positions from Wimereux on the right to Porsel on the left, to do\r\nhomage to the sovereign of a country which had been the most\r\nirreconcilable foe of the founder of his house; on the very heights at\r\nthe foot of which he himself had failed to rouse the French to\r\nenthusiasm; on the very spot where he had become the laughing-stock of\r\nthe world by his performance with that unfortunate tame eagle.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I repeat, not a gleam of pride or joy lighted up the\r\nSphinx-like mask. To see this man standing there unmoved amidst the\r\nhighest honours the world had to bestow, one could not help thinking of\r\nVoltaire's condemnation of fatalism as the guiding principal of life:\r\n\"If perchance fatalism be the true doctrine, I would sooner be without\r\nsuch a cruel truth.\"\r\n\r\nA regiment of lancers and one of dragoons lined the route from the\r\nlanding-stage to the railway station, for in those days the trains did\r\nnot stop alongside the boats; while on the bridge crossing the Liane,\r\nthree hundred sappers, bearded like the Pard, shouldering their axes,\r\nwearing their white leathern aprons, stood in serried ranks, three deep.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's yacht had been timed to enter the harbour at one, but it was\r\nwithin a minute or so of two before it was moored amidst the salutes\r\nfrom the forts. The Emperor, who had been on horseback the whole of the\r\nmorning--who, in fact, preferred that means of locomotion on all\r\nimportant occasions, as it showed him off to greater advantage,--had\r\nbeen standing by the side of his charger. He crossed the gangway,\r\nbeautifully upholstered in purple velvet and carpet to match, at once,\r\nand, after having kissed her hand, offered her his arm to assist her in\r\nlanding, Prince Albert and the royal children coming immediately behind\r\nthe Imperial host and his principal guest. A magnificent roomy barouche,\r\ncapable of holding six persons and lined with white satin, but only\r\ndrawn by two horses--such horses! for in that respect Napoléon had\r\nspent his time to advantage in England,--stood waiting to convey the\r\nRoyal family. The Emperor himself, though, mounted his horse once more,\r\nand took his place by the right of the carriage, the left being taken by\r\nMarshal Baraguey-d'Hilliers. The head of the procession started amidst\r\ntremendous cheers from the crowd, but we who came on behind heard some\r\ncurious comments upon this popular manifestation. Knowing that there\r\nwould be a considerable delay in getting the train off, I walked instead\r\nof driving. I was accompanied by Lord ----, who was never averse to\r\nhaving his little joke. \"Hé bien, mon ami,\" he said to an old\r\nweather-beaten sailor, who was short of his left leg--\"hé bien, mon ami,\r\nnous voilà réconciliés.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, oui, je t'en fiche,\" was the answer; \"mais puisqu'ils en sont à se\r\nfaire des m'amours, ils devaient bien me rendre ma jambe que j'ai perdue\r\ndans leurs querelles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Imbécile,\" remarked an old soldier-looking man, who, though old, was\r\nevidently younger than the first speaker, and who was short of an arm,\r\n\"ta jambe ne t'irait pas plus que mon bras; c'était ta jambe de garçon.\"\r\n\r\n\"C'est vrai,\" nodded the other philosophically; \"tout de même, c'est\r\ndrôle que nous nous soyons battus comme des chiens,\" pointing across the\r\nChannel in the direction of England, \"pour en arriver à cela. Si le\r\nvieux (Napoléon I.) revenait, il serait rudement colère.\" And I may say\r\nat once that, notwithstanding the friendly attitude throughout of the\r\nrural as well as of the Parisian populations, that was the underlying\r\nsentiment. \"Waterloo est arrangé, non pas vengé,\" said a Parisian; \"il\r\nparaît qu'il y a des accommodements avec les rois, aussi bien qu'avec le\r\nciel.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, we did not leave Boulogne much before three--the\r\noriginal arrangement had been for half-past one,--and when we reached\r\nParis it was dark, too early for the illuminations which had been\r\nprojected along the line of boulevards from the recently open Boulevard\r\nde Strasbourg to the Madeleine, not so much as a feature in the\r\nprogramme of reception, as in honour of the Queen generally. On the\r\nother hand, there was not sufficient daylight for the crowds to\r\ndistinguish the sovereign's features, and a corresponding disappointment\r\nwas the result. The lighted carriage lamps did not improve matters much.\r\nBut the Parisians--to their credit be it said--knowing that Queen\r\nVictoria had expressed her wish to be conveyed to St. Cloud in an open\r\ncarriage, instead of the closed State one used on such occasions, took\r\nnote of the intention, and acknowledged it with ringing cheers. Victor\r\nHugo has said that the Parisian loves to show his teeth--he must either\r\nbe laughing or growling; and at the best of times it is an ungrateful\r\ntask to analyse too thoroughly such manifestations of enthusiasm. There\r\nare always as many reasons why nations should hate as love each other.\r\nThe sentiment, as expressed by the sailor and soldier alluded to just\r\nnow, did exist--of that I feel sure; but amidst the truly fairy\r\nspectacle then presented to the masses that crowded the streets, it may\r\nhave been forgotten for the moment.\r\n\r\nFor, in spite of the gathering darkness, the scene was almost unique. I\r\nhave only seen another one like it, namely, when the troops returned\r\nfrom the Franco-Austrian War; and people much older than I declared that\r\nthe next best one was that on the occasion of the return of the Bourbons\r\nin 1814.\r\n\r\nThough the new northern station, erected on the site of the old, had\r\nbeen virtually finished for more than a twelvemonth, the approaches to\r\nit were, if not altogether magnificent projects, little more than\r\nmagnificent mazes, stone and mortar Phoenixes, in the act of rising, not\r\nrisen, from Brobdignagian dust-heaps, and altogether unfit for any kind\r\nof spectacular procession. Consequently, it had been decided to connect\r\nthe northern with the eastern line immediately after entering the\r\nfortifications. The Strasbourg Station did not labour under the same\r\ndisadvantages; the boulevard of that name stretched uninterruptedly as\r\nfar as the Boulevard St. Denis, although, as yet, there were few houses\r\non it. I have seen a good many displays of bunting in my time; I have\r\nseen Turin and Florence and Rome beflagged and decorated on the\r\noccasions of popular rejoicings; I have seen historical processions in\r\nthe university towns of Utrecht and Leyden; I have seen triumphal\r\nentries in Brussels; I was in London on Thanksgiving day, but I have\r\nnever beheld anything to compare with the wedged masses of people along\r\nthe whole of the route, as far as the Bois de Boulogne, on that Saturday\r\nafternoon. The whole of the suburban population had, as it were, flocked\r\ninto Paris. The regulars lined one side of the whole length of the\r\nBoulevards, the National Guards the other. And there was not a single\r\nhouse from the station to the southernmost corner of the Rue Royale\r\nthat had not its emblems, its trophies, its inscriptions of \"welcome.\"\r\nWith that inborn taste which distinguishes the Parisians, the decorator\r\nhad ceased trying to gild the gold and to paint the lily at that point,\r\nand had left the magnificent perspective to produce its own effect--a\r\nfew Venetian masts along the Avenue de Champs-Élysées and nothing more.\r\nAmong the notable features of the decorations in the main artery of\r\nParis was the magnificent triumphal arch, erected by the management of\r\nthe Opéra between the Rue de Richelieu and what is now the Rue Drouot.\r\nIt rose to the fourth stories of the adjacent houses, and looked, not a\r\ntemporary structure, but a monument intended to stand the wear and tear\r\nof ages. No description could convey an idea of its grandeur. The inside\r\nwas draped throughout with bee-bespangled purple, the top was decorated\r\nwith immense eagles, seemingly in full flight, and holding between their\r\ntalons proportionately large scutcheons, bearing the interlaced\r\nmonograms of the Imperial hosts and the Royal guests. In front of the\r\nPassage de l'Opéra stood an allegorical statue, on a very beautiful\r\npedestal draped with flags; and further on, at the back of the\r\nOpéra-Comique, which really should have been its front,[75] an obelisk,\r\nthe base of which was a correct representation, in miniature, of the\r\nPalais de l'Industrie (the then Exhibition Building). By the Madeleine a\r\nbattalion of the National Guards had erected, at their own cost, two\r\nmore allegorical statues, France and England. A deputation from the\r\nNational Guards had also presented her Majesty with a magnificent\r\nbouquet on alighting from the train.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 75: In 1782, when Heurtier, the architect, submitted\r\n         his plan of the building which was intended for the Italian\r\n         singing-actors, the latter offered a determined opposition to\r\n         the idea of the theatre facing the Boulevards, lest they should\r\n         be confounded with the small theatres on the Boulevard du\r\n         Temple and in the direction of the present Boulevard des\r\n         Filles-du-Calvaire. This extraordinary vanity was lampooned on\r\n         all sides, and especially in a _quatrain_, which I forbear to\r\n         quote even in French.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nBy a very delicate attention, the private apartments of the Queen had,\r\nin many ways, been made to look as much as possible like those at\r\nWindsor Castle; and where this transformation was found impossible by\r\nreason of their style of decoration--such as, for instance, in the\r\nformer boudoir of Marie-Antoinette,--the mural paintings and those of\r\nthe ceiling had been restored by two renowned artists. In addition to\r\nthis, the most valuable pictures had been borrowed from the Louvre to\r\nenhance the splendour of the reception and dining rooms, while none but\r\ncrack regiments in full dress were told off for duty.\r\n\r\nThe day after the Queen's arrival being Sunday, the entertainment after\r\ndinner consisted solely of a private concert; on the Monday the Queen\r\nvisited the Fine Arts' Section of the Exhibition, which was located in a\r\nseparate building at the top of the Avenue Montaigne, and connected with\r\nthe main structure by beautifully laid-out gardens. The Queen spent\r\nseveral hours among the modern masterpieces of all nations, and two\r\nFrench artists had the honour of being presented. I will not be certain\r\nof the names, because I was not there, but, as far as I can remember,\r\nthey were Ingres and Horace Vernet.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of art, I cannot help digressing for a moment. I\r\nmay take it that in 1855 a good many Englishmen of the better middle\r\nclasses, though not exactly amateurs or connoisseurs of pictures, were\r\nacquainted with the names, if not with the works, of the French masters\r\nof the modern school. Well, in that same year, the English school burst\r\nupon the corresponding classes in France like a revelation--nay, I may\r\ngo further still, and unhesitatingly affirm that not a few critics, and\r\nthose of the best, shared the astonishment of the non-professional\r\nmultitude. They had heard of Sir Joshua Reynolds and Gainsborough,\r\nperhaps of Turner, but Constable and Moreland, Wilkie and Webster,\r\nMulready, and the rest of the younger school, were simply so many names.\r\nBut when the critics did become aware of their existence, their\r\ncriticisms were simply a delightful series of essays, guiding the most\r\nignorant to a due appreciation of those Englishmen's talents, not\r\nstinting praise, but by no means withholding blame, instinctively\r\nfocussing merits and defects in a few brilliant paragraphs, which\r\ndetected the painter's intention and conception as well as his execution\r\nboth from a technical, as well as dramatic, graphic, and pictorial point\r\nof view; which showed, not only the influence of general surroundings,\r\nbut dissected the result of individual tendencies. Many a time since,\r\nwhen wading through the adipose as well as verbose columns dealing with\r\nsimilar subjects in English newspapers, have I longed for the literary\r\nfleshpots of France, which contained and contain real nourishing\r\nsubstance, not the fatty degeneration of an ignoramus's brain, and, what\r\nis worse, of an ignoramus who speaks in numbers from a less valid\r\nreason than Pope's; for the most repellant peculiarity of these\r\neffusions are the numbers. It would seem that these would-be critics,\r\nhaving no more than the ordinary auctioneer's intellect, endeavour as\r\nmuch as possible to assimilate their effusions to a catalogue. They are\r\nan abomination to the man who can write, though he may know nothing\r\nabout painting, and to the man who knows about painting and cannot\r\nwrite. The pictorial art of England must indeed be a hardy plant to have\r\nsurvived the approval and the disapproval of these barbarians.\r\n\r\nTo come back to the Queen, who, after leaving the Palais de l'Industrie,\r\ndrove to several points of interest in Paris, notably to la\r\nSainte-Chapelle. The route taken was by the Rue de Rivoli and the\r\nPont-Neuf; the return journey was effected by the Pont-aux-Changes and\r\nthe eastern end of the same street, which had only been opened recently,\r\nas far as the Place de la Bastille. Then, and then only, her Majesty\r\ncaught sight of the Boulevards in the whole of their extent. The\r\ndecorations of the previous day but one had not been touched, and the\r\ncrowds were simply one tightly wedged-in mass of humanity. A\r\njournalistic friend had procured me a _permis de circuler_--in other\r\nwords, \"a police pass,\"--and I made the way from the Boulevard\r\nBeaumarchais to Tortoni on foot. It may be interesting to those who are\r\nalways prating about the friendship between England and France to know\r\nthat I heard not a single cry of \"Vive l'Angleterre!\" On the other hand,\r\nI heard a great many of \"Vive la Reine!\" Even the unthinking crowd,\r\nthough yielding to the excitement of the moment, seemed to distinguish\r\nbetween the country and her ruler. I am not commenting upon this: I am\r\nmerely stating a fact. Probably it is not England's fault that she has\r\nnot been able to inspire the French nation as a whole with anything like\r\na friendly feeling, but it is as well to point it out. During the whole\r\nof the Crimean War, nine out of every ten educated Frenchmen openly\r\nasserted that France had been made a cat's-paw by England, that the\r\nalliance was one forced upon the nation by Napoléon from dynastic and\r\npersonal, rather than from patriotic and national, motives; there were\r\nsome who, at the moment of the Queen's visit, had the candour to say\r\nthat this, and this only, would be France's reward for the blood and\r\nmoney spent in the struggle. At the same time, it is but fair to state\r\nthat these very men spoke both with admiration and respect of England's\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock there was a brilliant reception at the Élysée, when the\r\nmembers of the corps diplomatique accredited to the Tuileries were\r\npresented to the Queen. Shortly after five her Majesty returned to\r\nSaint-Cloud, where, in the evening, the actors of the Comédie-Française\r\ngave, at the Queen's special request, a performance of \"Les Demoiselles\r\nde Saint-Cyr.\" She had seen the piece in London, and been so pleased\r\nwith it that she wished to see it again. Though I was on very intimate\r\nterms with Dumas, we had not met for several weeks, which was not\r\nwonderful, seeing that I was frequently appealed to by the son himself\r\nfor news of his father. \"What has become of him? He might be at the\r\nantipodes for all I see of him,\" said Alexandre II. about a dozen times\r\na year. However, two or three days after the performance at Saint-Cloud,\r\nI ran against him in the Chaussée d'Antin. \"Well, you ought to be\r\npleased,\" I said; \"it appears that not only has the Queen asked to see\r\nyour piece, which she had already seen in London, but that she enjoyed\r\nit even much better the second than the first time.\"\r\n\r\n\"C'est comme son auteur,\" he replied: \"plus on le connait, plus on\r\nl'aime. Je sais pourtant bien ce qui l'aurait amusée même d'avantage que\r\nde voir ma pièce, c'eut été de me voir moi-même, et franchement, ça\r\nm'aurait amusé aussi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did not you ask for an audience? I am certain it would have\r\nbeen granted,\" I remarked, because I felt convinced that her Majesty\r\nwould have been only too pleased to confer an honour upon such a man.\r\n\r\n\"En effet, j'y ai pensé,\" came the reply; \"une femme aussi remarquable\r\net qui deviendra probablement la plus grande femme du siècle aurait du\r\nse rencontrer avec le plus grand homme en France, mais j'ai eu peur\r\nqu'on ne me traite comme Madame de Staël traitât Saint-Simon. C'est\r\ndommage, parcequ'elle s'en ira sans avoir vu ce qu'il y de mieux dans\r\nnotre pays, Alexandre, Roi du Monde romanesque, Dumas l'ignorant.\" Then\r\nhe roared with laughter and went away.[76]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 76: Alexandre Dumas referred to a story in connection\r\n         with the Comte de Saint-Simon and Madame de Staël which is not\r\n         very generally known. One day the head of the new sect went to\r\n         see the authoress of \"Corinne.\" \"Madame,\" he said, \"vous êtes\r\n         la femme la plus remarquable en France; moi, je suis l'homme le\r\n         plus remarquable. Si nous nous arrangions à vivre quelques mois\r\n         ensemble, nous aurions peut-être l'enfant le plus remarquable\r\n         sur la terre.\" Madame de Staël politely declined the honour. As\r\n         for the epithet of \"l'ignorant\" which Dumas was fond of\r\n         applying to himself, it arose from the fact of Dumas, the\r\n         celebrated professor of chemistry, being spoken of as \"Dumas le\r\n         savant.\" \"Done,\" laughed the novelist, \"je suis Dumas\r\n         l'ignorant.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 21st, the Queen went to Versailles to inspect the\r\npicture-galleries established there by Louis-Philippe, and, in the\r\nevening, she was present at a gala-performance at the Opéra. Next day,\r\nshe paid a second visit to the Palais de l'Industrie, but to the\r\nindustrial section only. In the evening, there was a performance of \"Le\r\nFils de Famille\" (\"The Queen's Shilling\"). On the 23rd, she spent\r\nseveral hours at the Louvre; after which, at night, she attended the\r\nball given in her honour by the Municipality of Paris. I shall not\r\nattempt to describe that entertainment, the decorations and flowers of\r\nwhich alone cost three hundred and fifty thousand francs. The whole had\r\nbeen arranged under the superintendence of Ballard, the architect of the\r\nHalles Centrales. But I remember one little incident which caused a\r\nflutter of surprise among the court ladies, who, even at that time, had\r\nalready left off dancing in the pretty old-fashioned way, and merely\r\nwalked through their quadrilles. The royal matron of thirty-five, with a\r\ngoodly family growing up around her, executed every step as her dancing\r\nmaster had taught her, and with none of the listlessness that was\r\nsupposed to be the \"correct thing.\" I was standing close to Canrobert,\r\nwho had been recalled to resume his functions near the Emperor. After\r\nwatching the Queen for a minute or so, he turned round to the lady on\r\nhis arm. \"Pardi, elle danse comme ses soldats se battent, 'en veux-tu,\r\nen voilà;' et corrects jusqu'à la fin.\" There never was a greater\r\nadmirer of the English soldier than Canrobert. The splendour of that\r\nfête at the Hôtel-de-Ville has only been surpassed once, in 1867, when\r\nthe civic fathers entertained a whole batch of sovereigns.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th, there was a third visit to the Exhibition, and I remember\r\neight magnificent carriages passing down the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.\r\nThey were, however, only drawn by two horses each. I was making my way\r\nto the Champ de Mars, where a review was to be held in honour of her\r\nMajesty, and had told the cab to wait in the Rue Beaujon, while I\r\nstepped into the main road to have a look at the beautiful scene. The\r\nmoment the carriages were past I returned to the Rue Beaujon, and ran up\r\nagainst Béranger, who was living there. The old man seemed in a great\r\nhurry, which was rather surprising, because he was essentially\r\nphlegmatic, and rarely put himself out for anything. So I asked him the\r\nreason of his haste. \"I want to see your queen,\" he replied. A year or\r\ntwo before he had refused to go to the Tuileries to see the Empress, who\r\nhad sent for him; and the latter, who could be most charming when she\r\nliked, had paid him a visit instead.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you did not trouble yourself much about royalty,\" I remarked.\r\n\"You refused to go and see the Empress, and you rush along to see the\r\nQueen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Non; je vais voir la femme: s'il y avait beaucoup de femmes comme elle,\r\nje leur pardonnerais d'être reines.\"\r\n\r\nHer Majesty has never heard of this. It was the most magnificent and, at\r\nthe same time, most witty tribute to her private virtues. All this\r\nhappened many, many years ago. Since then I have often wondered why\r\nPrince Albert, who, I feel certain, knew the worth of all these men as\r\nwell as he knew the merit of the littérateurs of his own country, did\r\nnot suggest to his august consort a reception such as she gave to the\r\ncorps diplomatique. It would have been a most original thing to do; the\r\nrecollection of it would have been more delightful even than the most\r\nvivid recollections of that very wonderful week.\r\n\r\nIn those days, France was still looked upon as the first military power\r\nin Europe. Her soldiers were probably not superior to those who fell in\r\nthe Franco-German war, but their prestige had not been questioned. They\r\nwere also more sightly than the ill-clad legions of the Third Republic,\r\nso the review was a very splendid affair. At its termination, her\r\nMajesty repaired to the Invalides, to the tomb of Napoléon, which,\r\nthough it had been begun, as I have incidentally stated, under the\r\npremiership of M. Guizot in 1846-47, was not finished then, and only\r\nofficially inaugurated nearly six years afterwards.\r\n\r\nMy ticket for the review had been given to me by Marshal Vaillant, the\r\nminister for war, and the only Marshal of the Second Empire with whom I\r\nwas, at that time, intimately acquainted; though I became on very\r\nfriendly terms with Marshals MacMahon and Lebrun subsequently.\r\n\r\nI will devote, by-and-by, a few notes to this most original\r\nsoldier-figure--he was only a type in some respects; meanwhile, I may\r\nmention here an anecdote, in connection with this visit of the Queen,\r\ncharacteristic of the man. The governor of the Invalides was the late\r\nKing of Westphalia, Jérôme Bonaparte. It was but natural that he should\r\nhave been chosen as the custodian of his brother's last resting-place.\r\nIt was equally natural that he should feel reluctant to meet at that\r\ntomb the sovereign of a country which, he considered, had tortured that\r\nbrother to death. Consequently the last survivor of the elder\r\nBonapartes, the one who had also fought at Waterloo, foreseeing, as it\r\nwere, this pilgrimage on the part of her Majesty, had, a fortnight or so\r\nbefore the date of her intended visit, gone to Havre, whither he had\r\nbeen ordered by his doctor on account of his health, and whence he only\r\nreturned when the Queen of England had left France.\r\n\r\nThe deputy-governor of the Invalides was, perhaps, not considered\r\nsufficiently important to do the honours to so illustrious a visitor,\r\nand Marshal Vaillant was sounded whether he would undertake the\r\nfunctions. He declined. \"Je n'ai pas l'honneur, sire,\" he said,\r\n\"d'appartenir à votre illustre famille et personne sauf la famille d'un\r\ngrand homme a le droit d'oublier les souffrances que ses ennemis lui ont\r\ninfligées.\" He was an honest, upright soldier, abrupt and self-willed,\r\nbut kindly withal, and plainly perceived the faults of Louis-Napoléon's\r\npolicy and of his frequently misplaced generosity--above all, of his\r\nsystem of conciliating the sovereigns of Europe by fêtes and\r\nentertainments. \"Quand l'autre leur donnait des fêtes et des\r\nreprésentations de théâtre, c'était chez eux, et pas chez nous, ils en\r\npayaient les frais.\" More of him in a little while.\r\n\r\nAt the Queen's first visit to Versailles--the second took place on the\r\nSaturday before she left--she had been deeply moved at the sight of the\r\npicture representing her welcome at Eu by Louis-Philippe, to which\r\nceremony I alluded in one of my former notes. But even before this she\r\nhad expressed a wish to see the ruins of the Château de Neuilly, and the\r\ncommemorative chapel erected on the spot where the Duc d'Orléans met\r\nwith his fatal accident. \"La femme qui est si fidèle à ses vieilles\r\namitiés au milieu des nouvelles, surtout quand il s'agit de dynasties\r\nrivales, comme en ce moment, et quand cette femme est une reine, cette\r\nfemme est une amie bien précieuse,\" said Jérôme's son. Both the Emperor\r\nand the Empress found that their cousin had spoken truly.\r\n\r\nSaturday, the 25th, had been fixed for the fête at Versailles. In the\r\nmorning, the Queen went to the palace of Saint-Germain, which no English\r\nsovereign had visited since James II. lived there. She returned to\r\nSaint-Cloud, and thence to the magnificent abode of Louis XIV., which\r\nshe reached after dark--the Place d'Armes and the whole of the erstwhile\r\nroyal residence being brilliantly illuminated.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial and Royal party entered by the Marble Court, in the centre\r\nof which the pedestal to the statue of Louis XIV. had been decorated\r\nwith the rarest flowers. The magnificent marble staircase had, however,\r\nbeen laid with thick purple carpets, and the balustrades almost\r\ndisappeared beneath masses of exotics; it was the first time, if I\r\nremember rightly, that I had seen mosses and ferns and foliage in such\r\nprofusion. The Cent Gardes and the Guides de l'Impératrice were on duty,\r\nthe former on the staircase itself, the latter below, in the vestibule.\r\nAt the top, to the right and left, the private apartments of the Empress\r\nhad been arranged, the Queen occupied those formerly belonging to\r\nMarie-Antoinette. I was enabled to see these a few days later; they were\r\nthe most perfect specimens of the decorative art that flourished under\r\nLouis XVI. I have ever beheld. The boudoir was upholstered in light\r\nblue, festoons of roses running along the walls, and priceless Dresden\r\ngroups distributed everywhere; the dressing-rooms were hung with pale\r\ngreen, with garlands upon garlands of violets. The toilet service was of\r\nSèvres, with medallions after Lancret and Watteau. The historical Salle\r\nde l'Oeil-de-Boeuf, which preceded her Majesty's apartments, had been\r\ntransformed into a splendid reception-room for the use of the Imperial\r\nhosts and all their Royal guests, for there were one or two foreign\r\nprinces besides, notably Prince Adalbert of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nThe ball was to take place in the famous Galerie des Glaces; the Empress\r\nherself had presided at its transformation, which had been inspired by a\r\nwell-known print of \"Une Fête sous Louis Quinze.\" More garlands of\r\nroses, but this time drooping from the ceiling and connecting the forty\r\nsplendid lustres, which, together with the candelabra on the walls,\r\ncould not have contained less than three thousand wax candles. At each\r\nof the four angles of the vast apartment a small orchestra had been\r\nerected, but very high up, and surrounded by a network of gilt wire.\r\n\r\nAt the stroke of ten those wonderful gardens became all of a sudden\r\nablaze with rockets and Chinese candles; it was the beginning of the\r\nfireworks, the principal piece of which represented Windsor Castle.\r\nAfter this, the ball was opened by the Queen and the Emperor, the\r\nEmpress and Prince Albert; but though the example had been given, there\r\nwas very little dancing. I was a comparatively young man then, but I was\r\ntoo busy feasting my eyes with the marvellous toilettes to pay much heed\r\nto the seductive strains, which at other times would have set me\r\ntripping. I fancy this was the case with most of the guests.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday the Queen left for home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n     Marshal Vaillant -- The beginning of our acquaintance -- His\r\n     stories of the swashbucklers of the First Empire, and the beaux\r\n     of the Restauration -- Rabelaisian, but clever -- Marshal\r\n     Vaillant neither a swashbuckler nor a beau; hated both -- Never\r\n     cherished the slightest illusions about the efficiency of the\r\n     French army -- Acknowledged himself unable to effect the desired\r\n     and necessary reforms -- To do that, a minister of war must\r\n     become a fixture -- Why he stayed -- Careful of the public\r\n     moneys, and of the Emperor's also -- Napoléon III.'s lavishness\r\n     -- An instance of it -- Vaillant never dazzled by the grandeur of\r\n     court entertainments -- Not dazzled by anything -- His hatred of\r\n     wind-bags -- Prince de Canino -- Matutinal interviews -- Prince\r\n     de Canino sends his seconds -- Vaillant declines the meeting, and\r\n     gives his reason -- Vaillant abrupt at the best of times -- A\r\n     freezing reception -- A comic interview -- Attempts to shirk\r\n     military duty -- Tricks -- Mistakes -- A story in point -- More\r\n     tricks -- Sham ailments: how the marshal dealt with them -- When\r\n     the marshal was not in an amiable mood -- Another interview --\r\n     Vaillant's tactics -- \"D----d annoying to be wrong\" -- The\r\n     marshal fond of science -- A very interesting scientific\r\n     phenomenon himself -- Science under the later Bourbons --\r\n     Suspicion of the soldiers of the Empire -- The priesthood and the\r\n     police -- The most godless republic preferable to a continuance\r\n     of their régime -- The marshal's dog, Brusca -- Her dislike to\r\n     civilians -- Brusca's chastity -- Vaillant's objection to\r\n     insufficiently prepaid letters -- His habit of missing the train,\r\n     notwithstanding his precautions -- His objection to fuss and\r\n     public honours.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout two or three days after the ball at Versailles, I went to see\r\nMarshal Vaillant at the War Office, to thank him for his kindness in\r\nsending me the ticket for the review. Our acquaintance was already then\r\nof a couple of years' standing. It had begun at Dr. Véron's, who lived,\r\nat the time, at the corner of the Rue de Rivoli and the Rue de\r\nCastiglione. The old soldier--he was over sixty then--had a very good\r\nmemory, and used to tell me garrison stories, love-adventures of the\r\nhandsome swashbucklers of the First Empire and of the beaux of the\r\nRestauration. The language was frequently that of Rabelais or Molière,\r\nvigorous, to the point, calling a spade a spade, and, as such, not\r\nparticularly adapted to these notes, but the narrator himself was\r\nneither a swashbuckler nor a beau; he hated the carpet-knight only one\r\ndegree more than the sabreur, and when both were combined in the same\r\nman--not an unusual thing during the Second Empire, especially after\r\nthe Crimean and Franco-Austrian wars--he simply loathed him. He fostered\r\nnot the slightest illusions about the efficiency of the French army,\r\nalbeit that, to an alien like myself and notwithstanding his friendship\r\nfor me, he would veil his strictures. At the same time, he frankly\r\nacknowledged himself unable to effect the desired reforms. \"It wants,\r\nfirst of all, a younger and abler man than I am; secondly, he must\r\nbecome a fixture. No change of ministry, no political vicissitudes ought\r\nto affect him. I do not play a political rôle, and never mean to play\r\none; and if I could find a man who would carry out the reforms at the\r\nWar Office, or, rather, reorganize the whole as it should be\r\nreorganized, I would make room for him to-morrow. I know what you are\r\ngoing to say. I derive a very comfortable income from my various\r\noffices, and I am a pluralist. If I did not take the money, some one\r\nelse would who has not got a scrap more talent than I have. There is not\r\na single man who dare tell the nation that its army is rotten to the\r\ncore, that there is not a general who knows as much as a mere captain in\r\nthe Austrian and Prussian armies; and if he had the courage to tell the\r\nnation, he would be hounded out of the country, his life would be made a\r\nburden to him. That is one of the reasons why I am staying, because I\r\ncan do no good by going; on the contrary, I might do a good deal of\r\nharm. Because, as you see it, the three hundred and fifty thousand\r\nfrancs of my different appointments, I save them by looking after the\r\nmoney of the State. Not that I can do much, but I do what I can.\"\r\n\r\nThat was very true: he was very careful of the public moneys, and of the\r\nresources of the Emperor also, entrusted to him by virtue of his\r\nposition as Grand-Maréchal du Palais; it was equally true that he could\r\nnot do much. Napoléon was, by nature, lavish and soft-hearted; as a\r\nconsequence, he became the butt of every impostor who could get a letter\r\nconveyed to him. His civil list of over a million and a half sterling\r\nwas never sufficient. He himself was simple enough in his tastes, but he\r\nknew that pomp and state were dear to the heart of Frenchmen, and he\r\nindulged them accordingly. But his charity was a personal matter. He\r\ncould have no more done without it than without his eternal cigarette.\r\nHe called the latter \"safety-valve of the brain; the former the\r\nsafety-valve of pride.\" I remember an anecdote which was told to me by\r\nsome one who was in his immediate entourage when he was only President.\r\nIt was on the eve of a journey to some provincial town, and at the\r\ntermination of a cabinet council. While talking to some of his\r\nministers, he took a couple of five-franc pieces from his waistcoat, and\r\nspun them English fashion. \"C'est tout ce qui me reste pour mon voyage\r\nde demain, messieurs,\" he said, smiling. One of them, M. Ferdinand\r\nBarrot, saw that he was in earnest, and borrowed ten thousand francs,\r\nwhich the President found on his dressing-table when retiring for the\r\nnight. Four and twenty hours after, Napoléon had not even his two\r\nfive-franc pieces: they and M. Barrot's loan had disappeared in\r\nsubscriptions to local charities. Among the papers found at the\r\nTuileries after the Emperor's flight, there were over two thousand\r\nbegging letters, all dated within a twelvemonth, and all marked with\r\ntheir answer in the corner--that is, with the amount sent in reply. That\r\nsum amounted to not less than sixty thousand francs. And be it\r\nremembered that these were the petitions the Emperor had not entrusted\r\nto his secretaries or ministers as coming within their domain. The words\r\nof Marshal Vaillant, spoken many years before, \"I cannot do much, but I\r\ndo what I can,\" are sufficiently explained.\r\n\r\nOn the day alluded to above, the marshal was seriously complaining of\r\nthe Emperor's extravagance. He did not hold with entertaining so many\r\nsovereigns. \"I do not say this,\" he added, \"with regard to yours, for\r\nher hospitality deserved such return as the Emperor gave her; but with\r\nregard to the others who will come, you may be sure, if we last long\r\nenough. Well, we'll see; perhaps you'll remember my words.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the old soldier was never much dazzled by the grandeur of those\r\nentertainments, nor did he foster many illusions with regard to their\r\ntrue value in cementing international friendships. The marshal was not\r\ndazzled by anything; and though deferential enough to the members of the\r\nemperor's family, he never scrupled to tell them his mind. The Emperor's\r\ncousin (Plon-Plon) could tell some curious stories to that effect. The\r\nmarshal had a hatred of long-winded people, and especially of what\r\nCarlyle calls wind-bags. Another of Louis-Napoléon's cousins came\r\ndecidedly under the latter description: I allude to the Prince de\r\nCanino. In order to get rid as much as possible of wordy visitors,\r\nVaillant had hit upon the method of granting them their interviews at a\r\n_very_, _very_ early hour in the morning; in the summer at 6.30 in the\r\nmorning, in the winter at 7.15. \"People do not like getting out of bed\r\nat that time, unless they have something serious to communicate,\" he\r\nsaid; and would not relax his rule, even for the softer sex. The old\r\nwarrior, who had probably been an early riser all his life, found the\r\narrangement work so well, that he determined at last not to make any\r\nexceptions. \"I get the day to myself,\" he laughed. Now, it so happened\r\nthat the Prince de Canino asked him for an interview; and, as a matter\r\nof course, Vaillant appointed the usual hour. Next morning, to\r\nVaillant's great surprise, instead of the Prince, came two of his\r\nfriends. The latter came to ask satisfaction of Vaillant for having\r\ndared to disturb a personage of the Prince's importance at so early an\r\nhour. \"Mais je ne l'ai pas dérangé du tout: il n'avait qu'à ne pas\r\nvenir, ce que du reste, il a fait,\" said Vaillant; then he added, \"Mais,\r\nmême, si je consentais à donner raison au prince de mon offense\r\nimaginaire, je ne me battrai pas à quatre heures de l'après-midi; donc,\r\nil aurait à se déranger; il vaut mieux qu'il reste dans son lit. Je vous\r\nsalue, messieurs.\" With which he bowed them out. When the Emperor heard\r\nof it, he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and Napoléon did\r\nnot laugh outright very often or easily.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many stories about this objection of Marshal Vaillant\r\nto be troubled for nothing; and, as usual, they overshoot the mark. He\r\nis supposed to have acted very cavalierly with highly placed personages,\r\nand even with ladies in very high society. Of course, I was never\r\npresent at interviews of that kind, but during my long acquaintance with\r\nhim, I was often seated at his side when less exalted visitors were\r\nadmitted. At the best of times his manner was abrupt, though rarely\r\nrude, unless there was a reason for it, albeit that the outsider might\r\nfail to fathom it at the first blush. I remember being with him in his\r\nprivate room, somewhere about the sixties, when his attendant brought\r\nhim a card.\r\n\r\n\"Show the gentleman in,\" said Vaillant, after having looked at it.\r\n\r\n_Enter_, a tall, well-dressed individual, the rosette of the Legion of\r\nHonour in his button-hole, evidently a retired officer.\r\n\r\n\"What is it you want with me?\" asked the marshal, who had remained\r\nseated with his back towards the visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Being in Paris for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, your\r\nexcellency, I thought it my duty to pay my respects to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all you want with me?\" asked the marshal.\r\n\r\n\"That is all, your excellency,\" stammered the visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Very well: then I'll wish you good morning.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose I must have looked somewhat shocked at this very unceremonious\r\nproceeding, for, when the door was closed, the marshal explained.\r\n\r\n\"You need not think that I have done him an injustice. When fellows like\r\nthis present their respects it always means that they want me to present\r\nthem with something else; that is why I cut them short.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes these interviews took a comical turn, for the marshal could be\r\nvery witty when he liked. In the land of \"equality,\" everybody is always\r\non the look-out for greater privileges than his fellows, and in no case\r\nwere and are favours more indiscriminately requested than with the view\r\nof avoiding military service. A thousand various pretexts, most of them\r\nutterly ridiculous, were brought forward by the parents to preserve\r\ntheir precious sons from the hated barrack life. In many instances, a\r\nfew years of soldiering would have done those young hopefuls a great\r\ndeal of good, because those who clamoured loudest for exemption were\r\nonly spending their time in idleness and mischief. In the provinces\r\nthere was a chance of influencing the _conseil de révision_ by means of\r\nthe préfet, if the parents were known to be favourable to the\r\ngovernment; by means of the bishops, if they still had a hankering after\r\nthe former dynasties; and, not to mince matters, if they were simply\r\nrich, by means of bribery. In Paris the matter was somewhat more\r\ndifficult; the members of the council were frequently changed at the\r\nlast moment, and at all times the recruits to be examined were too\r\nnumerous for a parent to trust to the memory of those members. The\r\nmilitary authorities had introduced a new rule, to the effect that the\r\nnames of the recruits to be examined should not be called out until\r\ntheir examination was finished; and, with the best will in the world, it\r\nis often difficult to distinguish between un fils de famille and a\r\ndownright plebeian if both happen to come before you \"as God made them.\"\r\nConsequently, notwithstanding the considerable ingenuity of the parties\r\ninterested to let the examining surgeon-major known \"who was who,\"\r\nmistakes frequently occurred; the young artisan, who had no more the\r\nmatter with him than the young wealthy bourgeois, was dismissed as\r\nunfit for the service, while the latter was pronounced apt in every\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nApropos of this, I know a good story, for the truth of which I can\r\nvouch, because it happened to a member of the family with which I became\r\nconnected by marriage afterwards. He had a son who was of the same age\r\nas his coachman's. Both the lads went to draw at the same time, both\r\ndrew low numbers. The substitute system was still in force, but, just at\r\nthat moment, there was a war-scare--not without foundation--and\r\nsubstitutes reached high prices. It would not have mattered much to the\r\nrich man. Unfortunately, he was tight-fisted, and the mother pleaded in\r\nvain. The wife was just as extravagant as the husband was mean; she had\r\nno savings, and she cudgelled her brain to find the means of preserving\r\nher darling from the vile contact of his social inferiors without\r\nputting her hand in her pocket--which, moreover, was empty. She went a\r\ngreat deal into society, was very handsome, clever, and fascinating. By\r\ndint of ferreting, she got to know the probable composition of the\r\nconseil de révision--barring accidents. History does not say how, but\r\nshe wheedled the surgeon-major into giving her a distinct promise to do\r\nhis best for her dear son. Of course, in order to do some good, the\r\nsurgeon had to see the young fellow first; and there was the difficulty,\r\nbecause madame had made the acquaintance of the officer under peculiar\r\ncircumstances, and could not very well introduce him to her home:\r\nbesides, just on account of the war-scare, the authorities had become\r\nvery strict, the practices of many officers were suspected, and it would\r\nnever have done for the gentleman to give his superiors as much as a\r\nloophole for their suspicion by visiting the lady. Time was getting\r\nshort; the acquaintance had ripened into friendship very quickly,\r\nbecause, three days before the time appointed for the sitting of the\r\ncouncil, madame had never seen the surgeon, and on the eve of that\r\nsitting the final arrangement had been concluded. It was to this effect:\r\nthat madame's son would pretend to have hurt his hand, and appear with a\r\nblack silk bandage round his wrist. The thing is scarcely credible, but\r\nthe coachman's son, an engine-fitter, had hurt his wrist, and put a\r\nstrip of black ribbon round it. The coachman's family name began with a\r\n_B_, the lady's name with a _C_. The coachman's son was taken for the\r\nother, and declared unfit for military service by reason of his chest,\r\nto his great surprise and joy, as may be imagined. But the surprise,\r\nthough not the joy, of the examining officer was greater still when, in\r\nthe next batch, another young fellow appeared with a strip of black\r\nribbon round his wrist. To ask his name was an impossibility. The\r\nsurgeon was afraid that he had been betrayed, or that his secret had\r\nleaked out, and, without a moment's hesitation, declared the real Simon\r\nPure sound in lungs and limb.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I have drifted a little bit from Marshal Vaillant's comical\r\ninterviews, but am coming back to them in a roundabout way. The common,\r\nor garden trick to get those young fellows exempted, where bribery was\r\nimpossible or private influence out of the question, was to make them\r\nsham short-sightedness, or deafness, or impediment in the speech. We\r\nhave heard before now of professors who cure people of stammering: it is\r\na well-known fact that in those days there was a professor who taught\r\npeople to stammer; while, personally, I know an optician on the\r\nBoulevard des Italians whose father made a not inconsiderable fortune by\r\nspoiling young fellows' sights--that is, by training them, for a\r\ntwelvemonth before the drawing of lots, to wear very powerful lenses. Of\r\ncourse, this had to be done gradually, and his fee was a thousand\r\nfrancs. I have known him to have as many as twenty or thirty pupils at a\r\ntime. No doubt the authorities were perfectly aware of this, but they\r\nhad no power to interfere. The process for \"teaching deafness\" was even\r\na more complicated one, but it did succeed for a time in imposing upon\r\nthe experts, until, by a ministerial decree, it was resolved to draft\r\nall these clever stammerers, and even those who were really suffering\r\nfrom the complaints the others simulated, into the transport and medical\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Marshal Vaillant was overwhelmed with visits from\r\nanxious matrons who wanted to save their sons, and that the comical\r\ninterviews took place.\r\n\r\n\"But, excellency, my son is really as deaf as a post,\" one would\r\nexclaim.\r\n\r\n\"All the better, madame: he won't be frightened at the first sound of\r\nserious firing. Nearly all young recruits are terror-stricken at the\r\nfirst whizzing of the bullets around them. I was, myself, I assure you.\r\nHe'll make an admirable soldier.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he won't be able to hear the word of command.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessary, madame; he'll only have to watch the others, and do as\r\nthey do. Besides, we'll draft him into the cavalry: it is really the\r\ncharger that obeys the signals, not the trooper. It will be an advantage\r\nto him to be deaf in the barrack-room, for there are many things said\r\nthere that would bring a blush to his nice innocent cheeks; and, upon\r\nthe whole, it is best he should not hear them. I have the honour to wish\r\nyou good morning, madame.\"\r\n\r\nAnd though the woman knew that the old soldier was mercilessly chaffing\r\nher and her milksop son, the thing was done so politely and so\r\napparently seriously on the marshal's part, that she was fain to take no\r\nfor an answer.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, it appears--for the marshal liked to tell these tales,\r\nand he was not a bad mimic--he had just dismissed a lady similarly\r\nafflicted with a deaf son, when another entered whose offspring suffered\r\nfrom an impediment in his speech. \"Madame,\" the marshal said, without\r\nmoving a muscle, \"your son will realize the type of the soldier\r\nimmortalized by M. Scribe in 'Les Huguenots.' You know what Marcel\r\nsings.\" And, striking a theatrical attitude, he trolled--\r\n\r\n  \"'Un vieux soldat sait souffrir et se taire\r\n    Sans murmurer.'\r\n\r\nWith this additional advantage,\" he went on, \"that your son will be a\r\nyoung one. I can, however, promise you another comfort. A lady has just\r\nleft me whose son is as deaf as a post. I'll not only see that your son\r\nis drafted into the same company, but I'll make it my special business\r\nto have their beds placed side by side. The young fellow can go on\r\nstammering as long as he likes, it won't offend his comrade's hearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my son is very short-sighted, as blind as a bat, your excellency;\r\nhe won't be able to distinguish the friend from the foe,\" expostulated a\r\nthird lady.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let that trouble you, madame,\" was the answer; \"we'll put him in\r\nthe infantry: he has only got to blaze away, he is sure to hit some one\r\nor something.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the scenes when the marshal was in an amiable mood; when he\r\nwas not, he would scarcely suffer the slightest remark; but, if the\r\nremark was ventured upon, it had to be effectual, to be couched in\r\nlanguage as abrupt as his. \"Soft-sawder\" he hated above all things; and\r\neven when he was wrong, he would not admit it to any one who whined or\r\nspoke prettily. On the other hand, when the visitor or petitioner became\r\nas violent as he was himself, he often reversed his decision. One day,\r\nwhile waiting for the marshal, I met in the anteroom an individual who,\r\nby his surly looks, was far from pleased. After striding up and down for\r\na while, he began to bang on the table, and to shout at the top of his\r\nvoice, calling the old soldier all kinds of names. Out came the marshal\r\nin his shirt-sleeves--the moment the lady-visitors were gone he always\r\ntook off his coat. \"Come back, monsieur,\" he said to the individual. In\r\na few moments, the latter came out of the marshal's private room, his\r\nface beaming with joy. Then I went in, and found the marshal rubbing his\r\nhands with glee. \"A capital fellow, after all, a capital fellow,\" he\r\nkept on saying.\r\n\r\n\"He may be a capital fellow,\" I remarked, \"but he is not very choice in\r\nhis language.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's only his way; he does not like to be refused things, but he is a\r\ncapital fellow for all that, and that's why I granted his request. If he\r\nhad whined about it, I should not have done so, though I think he is\r\nentitled to what he came for.\"\r\n\r\nStrategical skill, in the sense the Germans have taught us since to\r\nattach to the word, Marshal Vaillant had little or none. Most of his\r\ncontemporaries, even the younger generals, were scarcely better endowed\r\nthan their official chief. They were all good soldiers when it came to\r\nstraightforward fighting, as they had been obliged to do in Africa, but\r\nthere was not a great leader, scarcely an ordinary tactician, among\r\nthem. As I have already shown, among the men most painfully aware of\r\nthis was the marshal himself; nevertheless, when he once made up his\r\nmind to a course of action, it was almost impossible to dissuade him\r\nfrom it. He had set his heart upon Marshal Niel occupying the Aland\r\nisland during the winter of '54-55, in the event of Bomarsund falling\r\ninto French hands. He did not for a moment consider that the fourteen\r\nthousand troops were too few to hold it, if the Russians cared to\r\ncontest its possession,--too many, if they merely confined themselves to\r\nintercepting the supplies, which they could have done without much\r\ndifficulty. A clever young diplomatist, who knew more about those parts\r\nthan the whole of the intelligence department at the Ministry for War,\r\nat last made him abandon his decision. I came in as he went out; the\r\nmarshal was as surly as a bear with a sore head. \"Clever fellow this,\"\r\nhe growled, \"very clever fellow.\" And then, in short jerky sentences, he\r\ntold me the whole of the story, asking my opinion as to who was right\r\nand who was wrong. I told him frankly that I thought that the young\r\ndiplomatist was right. \"That's what I think,\" he spluttered; \"but you'll\r\nadmit that it is d----d annoying to be wrong.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong to infer that the marshal, though deficient as a\r\nstrategist, was the rough-and-ready soldier, indifferent to more\r\ncultured pursuits, as so many of his fellow-officers were. He was very\r\nfond of certain branches of science, and rarely missed a meeting of the\r\nscientific section of the Académie, of which he was a member. What\r\nattracted him most, however, was astronomy; next to that came entomology\r\nand botany. Still, though an enthusiast, and often risking a cold to\r\nobserve an astral phenomenon, he objected to wasting thousands of pounds\r\nfor a similar purpose; in fact, when it came to disbursing government\r\nmoney for a scientific or other vaguely defined purpose, his economic\r\ntendencies got the better of him. \"I am a very interesting scientific\r\nphenomenon myself,\" he used to say, \"or, at any rate, I was; and yet no\r\none spent any money to come and see me.\"\r\n\r\nHe was alluding to a fact which he often told me himself, and afterwards\r\nnarrated in his \"memoirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"For a long while, especially from 1818 to 1830, when the weather\r\nhappened to be very dry and cold, and when I returned to my grateless,\r\nhumble room, after having spent the day in heated apartments, I was both\r\nthe spectator and the medium of strange electrical phenomena.\r\n\r\n\"The moment I had undressed and stood in my shirt, the latter began to\r\ncrackle and became absolutely luminous, emitting a lot of sparks; the\r\ntails stuck together, and remained like that for some time.\"\r\n\r\nI asked him, on one occasion, whether he had ever communicated all this\r\nto scientific authorities. His answer, though not a direct one to my\r\nquestion, was not only very characteristic of the mental and moral\r\nattitude of the soldiers of the Empire towards the Bourbons, but, to a\r\ngreat extent, of the attitude of the Bourbons themselves towards\r\neverybody and everything that was not absolutely in accordance with the\r\npolicy, sociology, and religious tenets of their adherents, whether\r\nlaymen or priests.\r\n\r\n\"You must remember, my dear fellow,\" he replied, \"the régime under which\r\nwe lived when I was subject to those electrical manifestations; you must\r\nfurther remember that I had fought at Ligny and at Waterloo, and, though\r\nnot absolutely put on the retired list in 1815, I and the rest of the\r\nEmperor's soldiers were watched, and our most innocent acts construed\r\ninto so many small attempts at conspiracy. You have not the slightest\r\nidea what the police were like under the Restauration, let alone the\r\npriesthood. If I couple these two, I am not speaking at random. If I had\r\ncommunicated the things I told you of, to no matter what savant, he\r\nwould necessarily have published the result of his observations and\r\nexperiments, and do you know what would have happened? I should have\r\nbeen tried, and perhaps condemned, for witchcraft--yes, for\r\nwitchcraft,--or else I should have been taken hold of by the priests,\r\nnot as a scientific phenomenon, but as a religious one, a kind of\r\n_stigmatisé_. They would have made it out to their satisfaction that I\r\nwas either half a saint, or a whole devil, and in either case my life\r\nwould have become a burden to me. Only those who have lived under the\r\nBourbons can form an idea of the terrorizing to which they lent\r\nthemselves. People may tell you that they were kind and charitable, and\r\nthis, that, and the other. There never were greater tyrants than they\r\nwere at heart; and if the Duc d'Angoulême or the Comte de Chambord had\r\ncome to the throne, France would have sunk to the intellectual level of\r\nSpain. I would sooner see the most godless republic than a return of\r\nthat state of things, and I need not tell you that I firmly believe that\r\nnot a sparrow falls to the earth without God's will. No, I held my\r\ntongue about my electrical sensations; if I had not, you would not now\r\nbe talking to Marshal Vaillant--I should have become a jabbering idiot,\r\nif I had lived long enough.\" It is the longest speech I have ever heard\r\nthe marshal make.\r\n\r\nThe marshal's own rooms were simply crammed with cases full of\r\nbeetles, butterflies, etc. The space not taken up by these was devoted\r\nto herbariums; and in the midst of the most interesting\r\nconversation--interesting to the listener especially, for the old\r\nsoldier was an inexhaustible mine of anecdote--he, the listener, would\r\nbe invited to look at a bit of withered grass or a wriggling\r\ncaterpillar.\r\n\r\nAfter the Franco-Austrian war, there was an addition to the marshal's\r\nhousehold--I might say family, for the old man became as fond of Brusca\r\nas if she had been a human being. The story went that she had been\r\nbequeathed to him at Solferino by her former master, an Austrian\r\ngeneral; and the marshal did not deny it. At any rate, he found Brusca\r\nsitting by the dying man, and licking the blood oozing from his wounds.\r\n\r\nBrusca was not much to look at, and you might safely have defied a\r\ncommittee of the most eminent authorities on canine breeds to determine\r\nhers, but she was very intelligent, and of a most affectionate\r\ndisposition. Nevertheless, she was always more or less distant with\r\ncivilians: it took me many years to worm myself into her good graces,\r\nand I am almost certain that I was the only _pékin_ thus favoured. The\r\nvery word made her prick up her ears, show her teeth, and straighten her\r\ntail as far as she could. For the appendage did not lend itself readily\r\nto the effort; it was in texture like that of a colley or Pomeranian,\r\nand twisted like that of a pug. Curiously enough, her objection to\r\ncivilians did not extend to the female portion, but the sight of a\r\nblouse drove her frantic with rage. On such occasions, she had to be\r\nchained up. As a rule, however, Brusca's manifestations, whether of\r\npleasure or the reverse, were uttered in a minor key and unaccompanied\r\nby any change of position on her part. She mostly lay at the marshal's\r\nfeet, if she was not perched on the back of his chair, for Brusca was\r\nnot a large dog. She accompanied the marshal in his walks and drives,\r\nshe sat by his side at table, she slept on a rug at the foot of his bed.\r\nNow and then she took a gentle stroll through the apartment, carefully\r\nexamining the dried plants and beetles. But one day, or rather one\r\nevening, there was a complete change in her behaviour: it was at one of\r\nthe marshal's receptions, on the occasion of Emperor Francis-Joseph's\r\nvisit to Paris. Some of the officers of his Majesty's suite had been\r\ninvited, and at the sight of the, to her, once familiar uniforms her\r\ndelight knew no bounds. She was standing at the top of the landing when\r\nshe caught sight of them, and all those present thought for a moment\r\nthat the creature was going mad. As a matter of course, Brusca was not\r\nallowed to come into the reception-rooms, but on that night there was no\r\nkeeping her out. Locked up in the marshal's bedroom, she made the place\r\nring with her barks and yells, and they had to let her out. With one\r\nbound she was in the drawing-rooms, and for three hours she did not\r\nleave the side of the Austrian officers. When they took their\r\ndeparture, Brusca was perfectly ready, nay eager, to abandon her home\r\nand her fond master for their sake, and had to be forcibly prevented\r\nfrom doing so. The marshal did not know whether to cry or to laugh, but\r\nin the end he felt ready to forgive Brusca for her contemplated\r\ndesertion of him in favour of her countrymen. Some one who objected to\r\nthe term got the snub direct. \"Je maintiens ce que j'ai dit,\r\ncompatriotes; et je serais rudement fier d'avoir une compatriote comme\r\nelle.\"\r\n\r\nIf possible, Brusca from that moment rose in the marshal's estimation;\r\nshe was a perfect paragon. \"Cette chienne n'a pas seulement toutes les\r\nqualités de son genre, elle n'a même pas les vices de son sexe. Elle\r\nm'aime tellement bien qu'elle ne veut être distraite par aucun autre\r\namour. Elle vit dans le plus rigoureux célibat. La malheureuse,\" he said\r\nevery now and then, \"elle a failli se compromettre.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the marshal's boast about Brusca's morals, he was one day\r\ncompelled to admit a faux pas on her part, and for some weeks the \"vet\"\r\nhad an anxious time for it. \"Elle a mal tourné, mais que voulez-vous, je\r\nne vais pas l'abandonner.\" And when the crisis was over: \"Son incartade\r\nne lui a pas porté bonheur. Espérons que la leçon lui profitera.\"\r\n\r\nBrusca had her portrait painted by the \"Michael-Angelo of dogs,\" Jadin,\r\nand when it was finished the visitors were given an opportunity of\r\nadmiring it in the drawing-room, where it was on view for several\r\nconsecutive Tuesdays. After that, a great many of the marshal's\r\nfamiliars, supposed to be capable of doing justice to Brusca's character\r\nin verse, were appealed to, to write her panegyric, but though several\r\nAcademicians tried their hands, their lucubrations were not deemed\r\nworthy to be inscribed on the frame of Brusca's portrait, albeit that\r\none or two--the first in Greek--were engrossed on vellum, and adorned\r\nthe drawing-room table. The effusion that did eventually adorn the frame\r\nwas by an anonymous author--it was shrewdly suspected that it was by the\r\nmarshal himself, and ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Si je suis près de lui, c'est que je le mérite.\r\n   Rêvez mon sort brilliant; rêvez, ambitieux!\r\n   Du bien de mon maître en ami je profite,\r\n   J'aimerais son pain noir s'il était malheureux.\"\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of Marshal Vaillant was never to accept a letter not\r\nprepaid or insufficiently paid. The rule was so strictly enforced, both\r\nin his private and official capacity, that many a valuable report was\r\nruthlessly refused, and had to be traced afterwards through the various\r\npost-offices of Europe.\r\n\r\nSeven times out of ten the marshal, when travelling by himself, missed\r\nhis train. This would lead one to infer that he was unpunctual; on the\r\ncontrary, he was the spirit of punctuality. Unfortunately, he over-did\r\nthe thing. He generally reached the station half an hour or\r\nthree-quarters before the time, seated himself down in a corner, dozed\r\noff, and did not wake up until it was too late. The marshal was a native\r\nof Dyon; and at Nuits, situated between the former town and Beaune,\r\nthere lived a middle-aged spinster cousin whom he often went to visit.\r\nHe nearly always returned by the last train to Dyon, where he had his\r\nquarters at the Hôtel de la Cloche; and although often in the midst of a\r\npleasant family party, insisted upon leaving long before it was\r\nnecessary. As a matter of course, the station was in semi-darkness--for\r\nNuits is not a large place--and the booking-office was not open. One\r\nnight, it being very warm, he stretched himself leisurely on a grass\r\nplot, instead of on the hard seat, and there he was found at six in the\r\nmorning; several trains had come and gone, but no one had dared to wake\r\nhim. \"Mais, monsieur le maréchal, on aurait cru vous manquer de respect\r\nen vous éveillant. Après tout, vous n'êtes pas tout le monde, il y des\r\ndistinctions,\" said the stationmaster apologetically. \"La mort et le\r\nsommeil, monsieur,\" was the answer, \"font table rase de toute\r\ndistinction.\" It was a French version of our \"Death levels all:\" the\r\nmarshal was fond of paraphrasing quotations, especially from the\r\nEnglish, of which he had a very fair knowledge, having translated some\r\nmilitary works many years before. However, from that day forth,\r\ninstructions were given to take no heed of his rank, and to awaken him\r\nlike any other mortal, rather than have him miss his train.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the marshal did not like to be constantly reminded of his rank;\r\nif anything, he was rather proud of his very humble origin, and, instead\r\nof hiding his pedigree like a good many parvenus, he took delight in\r\npublishing it. I have seen a letter of his to some one who inquired on\r\nthe subject, not from sheer curiosity. \"My grandfather was a silkmercer\r\nin a small way on the place St. Vincent, at Dyon. His father had been a\r\ncoppersmith. I am unable to trace back further than that; my quarters of\r\nnobility stop there. Let me add, at the same time, that there is no more\r\nsilly proverb than the one 'Like father like son.' My father died poor,\r\nand respected by every one. I do not believe that he had a single enemy.\r\nHis friends called him Christ, he was so good and kind to everybody. I\r\nam not the least like him. He was short and slim, I am rather tall and\r\nstout; he was gentle, and people say that I am abrupt and harsh. In\r\nshort, he had as many virtues as I am supposed to have faults, and I am\r\nafraid the world is not at all mistaken in that respect.\"\r\n\r\nI, who knew him as well as most people, am afraid that the world was\r\nvery much mistaken. As a matter of course, the old soldier had many\r\nfaults, but his good qualities far outweighed the latter. He was modest\r\nto a degree, and the flatteries to which men in his position are\r\nnaturally exposed produced not the slightest effect upon him. When in an\r\namiable mood, he used to cut them short with a \"Oui, oui; le maréchal\r\nVaillant est un grand homme, il n'y a pas de doute; tout le monde est\r\nd'accord sur ce chapitre là, donc, n'en parlons plus.\" When not in an\r\namiable mood, he showed them the door, saying, \"Monsieur, si je suis\r\naussi grand homme que vous le dites, je suis trop grand pour m'occuper\r\nde vos petites affaires. J'ai l'honneur de vous saluer.\"\r\n\r\nHe was fond of his native town, one of whose streets bore or still bears\r\nhis name, though, according to all authorities, it never smelt sweet by\r\nwhatsoever appellation it went. But he objected to being lionized, so he\r\nnever stayed with the prefect, the maire, or the general commanding the\r\ndistrict, and simply took up his quarters at the hotel, insisting on\r\nbeing treated like any other visitor. The maire respected his wishes;\r\nthe population did not, which was a sore point with the marshal.\r\nNevertheless, when, in 1858, during their Exhibition, they wanted him to\r\ndistribute the prizes, he consented to do so, on condition that his\r\nreception should be of the simplest. The Dyonnais promised, and to a\r\ncertain extent kept their word. Next morning the prefect, accompanied by\r\nthe authorities, fetched him in his carriage. The ceremony was to take\r\nplace in the park itself, and at the entrance was posted General Picard,\r\naccompanied by his staff, and at the head of several battalions. The\r\nmoment the marshal set foot to the ground, the general saluted, the\r\ndrums rolled, and the bands played. The marshal felt wroth, and at the\r\nconclusion of the distribution sent for the general, whom, not to mince\r\nmatters, he roundly bullied.\r\n\r\nGeneral Picard did not interrupt him. \"Have you finished, monsieur le\r\nmaréchal?\" he asked at last.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I have finished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; the next time you come out as a simple bourgeois, you had\r\nbetter leave the grand cordon of the Legion of Honour at home. If I had\r\nnot saluted you as I did, I should have had the reprimand of the\r\nminister of war, and of the chancellor of the Legion of Honour. After\r\nall, I prefer yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am the minister for war.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing about that. I only saw an old gentleman with the grand\r\ncordon. If you are the minister for war, perhaps you will be good enough\r\nto tell Maréchal Vaillant, when you see him, that he must not tempt old\r\nsoldiers like myself to forget their duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, general. But what a hot fiery lot these Dyonnais are,\r\naren't they?\" Picard was a native of Dyon also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n     The Franco-German War -- Friday, July 15, 1870, 6 p.m. -- My\r\n     friends \"confident of France being able to chastise the insolence\r\n     of the King of Prussia\" -- I do not share their confidence; but\r\n     do not expect a crushing defeat -- Napoléon III.'s presence\r\n     aggravated the disasters; his absence would not have averted them\r\n     -- He himself had no illusions about the efficiency of the army,\r\n     did not suspect the rottenness of it -- His previous endeavours\r\n     at reorganization -- The real drift of his proposed inquiries --\r\n     His plan meant also compulsory service for every one -- Why the\r\n     legislature opposed it -- The makeshift proposed by it --\r\n     Napoléon weary, body and soul -- His physical condition -- A\r\n     great consultation and the upshot of it -- Dr. Ricord and what he\r\n     told me -- I am determined to see and hear, though not to speak\r\n     -- I sally forth -- The streets on the evening of Friday, the\r\n     15th of July -- The illuminations -- Patriotism or Chauvinism --\r\n     The announcement of a bookseller -- What Moltke thought of it --\r\n     The opinion of a dramatist on the war -- The people; no\r\n     horse-play -- No work done on Saturday and Sunday -- Cabmen -- \"A\r\n     man does not pay for his own funeral, monsieur\" -- The northern\r\n     station on Sunday -- The departing Germans -- The Emperor's\r\n     particular instructions with regard to them -- Alfred de Musset's\r\n     \"Rhin Allemand\" -- Prévost-Paradol and the news of his suicide --\r\n     The probable cause of it -- A chat with a superior officer -- The\r\n     Emperor's Sunday receptions at the Tuileries -- Promotions in the\r\n     army, upon what basis -- Good and bad officers -- The officers'\r\n     mess does not exist -- Another general officer gives his opinion\r\n     -- Marshal Niel and Leboeuf -- The plan of campaign suddenly\r\n     altered -- The reason -- The Emperor leaves St. Cloud -- His\r\n     confidence shaken before then -- Some telegrams from the\r\n     commanders of divisions -- Thiers is appealed to, to stem the\r\n     tide of retrenchment; afterwards to take the portfolio of war --\r\n     The Emperor's opinion persistently disregarded at the Tuileries\r\n     -- Trochu -- The dancing colonels at the Tuileries.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of thirteen years, it is difficult to put the exact hour\r\nand date to each exciting incident of a period which was absolutely\r\nphenomenal throughout. I kept no diary, only a few rough notes, because\r\nat that time I never thought of committing my recollections to paper,\r\nand have, therefore, to trust almost wholly to my memory; nevertheless I\r\nam positive as to main facts, whether witnessed by myself or\r\ncommunicated to me by friends and acquaintances. I remember, for\r\ninstance, that, immediately after the declaration of war, I was warned\r\nby my friends not to go abroad more than I could help, to keep away as\r\nmuch as possible from crowds. \"You are a foreigner,\" said one, \"and that\r\nwill be sufficient for any ragamuffin, who wants to do you a bad turn,\r\nto draw attention to you. By the time you have satisfactorily proved\r\nyour nationality you will be beaten black and blue, if not worse.\"\r\n\r\nThe advice was given on Friday, the 15th of July, about six in the\r\nafternoon; that is, a few hours after the news of the scenes in the\r\nChamber of Deputies and the Senate had spread, and when the centre of\r\nParis was getting gradually congested with the inhabitants of the\r\nfaubourgs. My friends were men of culture and education, and not at all\r\nlikely to be carried away by the delirium which, on that same night and\r\nfor the next week, converted Paris into one vast lunatic asylum, whose\r\ninmates had managed to throw off the control of their keepers; yet there\r\nwas not a single civilian among them who had a doubt about the eventual\r\nvictory of France, about her ability \"to chastise the arrogance of the\r\nKing of Prussia,\" to put the matter in their own words.\r\n\r\n\"To try to be wise after the event\" is a thing I particularly detest,\r\nbut I can honestly affirm that I did not share their confidence,\r\nalthough I did not suspect for a moment that the defeat would be so\r\ncrushing as it was. I remembered many incidents that had happened during\r\nthe previous four years of which they seemed conveniently oblivious; I\r\nwas also aware, perhaps, of certain matters of which they were either\r\nprofoundly ignorant, or professed to be; but, above all, I took to heart\r\nthe advice, tendered in the shape of, \"You are a foreigner;\" and though\r\nI feared no violence or even verbal recrimination on their part, I chose\r\nto hold my tongue.\r\n\r\nI hold no brief for the late Emperor, but I sincerely believe that he\r\nwas utterly averse to the war. I, moreover, think that if he had\r\nconsented to remain in Paris or at St. Cloud, the disaster would have\r\nhappened all the same. He had no illusions about the efficiency of his\r\narmies, though he may not have been cognizant of the thorough rottenness\r\nof the whole. But to have said so at any time, especially during the\r\nlast four years, would have been simply to sign the death-warrant of his\r\ndynasty. He endeavoured to remedy the defects in a roundabout way as\r\nearly as October, '66, by appointing a commission to draw up a plan for\r\nthe reorganization of the army. Apparently, Napoléon wanted larger\r\ncontingents; in reality, he hoped that the inquiry would lay bare such\r\nevidence of corruption as would justify him in dismissing several of\r\nthe men surrounding him from their high commands. But both those who\r\nonly saw the apparent drift as well as those who guessed at the real one\r\nwere equally determined in their opposition. It was the majority in the\r\nLegislature which first uttered the cry, immediately taken up by the\r\nadversaries of the régime, \"If this bill becomes law there will be an\r\nend of favourable numbers.\" In fact, the bill meant compulsory service\r\nfor every one, and the consent of the deputies to it would at once have\r\nforfeited their position with their electors, especially with the\r\npeasantry, to whom to apply the word \"patriotism\" at any time is\r\ntantamount to the vilest prostitution of it.\r\n\r\nOf the makeshift for that law I need say little or nothing. Without a\r\nsingle spy in France, without a single attaché in the Rue de Lille,\r\nBismarck was enabled by that only to determine beforehand the effects of\r\none serious military defeat on the dynasty of the Emperor; he was\r\nenabled to calculate the exact strength of the chain of defence which\r\nwould be offered subsequently. The French army was like the Scotch lad's\r\nporridge, \"sour, burnt, gritty, cold, and, ---- it, there was not enough\r\nof it.\" It is not underrating Bismarck's genius to say that a man of far\r\ninferior abilities than he would have plainly seen the course to pursue.\r\n\r\nWas Napoléon III. steeped in such crass ignorance as not to have had an\r\ninkling of all this? Certainly not; but he was weary, body and soul,\r\nand, but for his wife and son, he would, perhaps willingly, have\r\nabdicated. He had been suffering for years from one of the most\r\nexcruciating diseases, and a fortnight before the declaration of war the\r\nsymptoms had become so alarming that a great consultation was held\r\nbetween MM. Nélaton, Ricord, Fauvel, G. Sée, and Corvisart. The result\r\nwas the unanimous conclusion of those eminent medical men that an\r\nimmediate operation was absolutely necessary. Curiously enough, however,\r\nthe report embodying this decision was only signed by one, and not\r\ncommunicated to the Empress at all. It may be taken for granted that,\r\nhad she known of her husband's condition, she would not have agitated in\r\nfavour of the war, as she undoubtedly did.\r\n\r\nIt was only after the Emperor's death at Chislehurst that the document\r\nin question was found, but I happened to know Dr. Ricord intimately, and\r\nmost of the facts, besides those stated above, were known to me on that\r\nmemorable Friday, the 15th of July, 1870. As I have said already, I\r\nthought it wiser to hold my tongue.\r\n\r\nBut though determined _not to speak_--knowing that it would do no\r\nearthly good--I was equally determined _to see and to hear_; so, at\r\nabout eight, I sallied forth. The heat was positively stifling, and it\r\nwas still daylight, but, in their eagerness to show their joy, the\r\nParisians would not wait for darkness to set in, and, as I went along, I\r\nsaw several matrons of the better classes, aided by their maids, make\r\npreparations on the balcony for illuminating the moment the last rays of\r\nthe sun should set behind the horizon. I distinctly say matrons of the\r\nbetter classes, because my way lay through the Chaussée d'Antin, where\r\nthe tenancy of an apartment on the first, second, or third floor implied\r\na more than average income. I was, and am, aware that neither refinement\r\nnor good sense should be measured by the money at one's command, but\r\nunder similar circumstances it is impossible to apply any other valid\r\ntest. In the streets there was one closely wedged-in, seething mass, and\r\nthe noise was deafening; nevertheless, at the sight of one of those\r\nmatrons thus engaged there was a momentary lull, followed immediately by\r\nvociferous applause and the cry of \"Les mères de la patrie.\" From a\r\ncursory glance upward, I came to the conclusion that the progeny of\r\nthese ladies, if they were blessed with any, could as yet contribute but\r\nvery little to the glory of the nation; still, I reflected, at the same\r\ntime, that they had probably brothers and husbands who, within a few\r\nhours, might be called to the front, \"nevermore to return;\" that,\r\ntherefore, the outburst of patriotism could not be called an altogether\r\ncheap one. In fact, none but the thoroughly irreclaimable sceptic could\r\nfail to be struck with the genuine outburst of national resentment\r\nagainst a whole nation on the part of another nation, which, as I take\r\nit, means something different from unalloyed patriotism. It was a\r\nmixture of hatred and chauvinism, rather than the latter and more\r\nelevated sentiment. The \"sacred soil of France\"--though why more sacred\r\nthan any other soil, I have never been able to make out--was not\r\nthreatened in this instance by Prussia; carefully considered, it was not\r\neven a question of national honour offended for which Paris professed\r\nitself ready as one man to draw the sword, and yet the thousands in the\r\nstreet that night behaved as if each of them had a personal quarrel to\r\nsettle, not with one or two Germans, but with every son and daughter of\r\nthe Fatherland.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, a quarter after eight when I found myself in the\r\nChaussée d'Antin, and the distance to the Boulevard des Italiens was\r\ncertainly not more than two hundred and fifty yards; nevertheless, it\r\ntook me more than half an hour to get over it, for immediately on my\r\nemerging into the main thoroughfare I looked at a clock which pointed to\r\nnine. Two things stand out vividly in my memory: the first, the\r\npreparations of several business houses to illuminate on a grand scale,\r\nthere and then; _i. e._ the putting up of the elaborate crystal devices\r\nused by them on the 15th of August, the Emperor's fête-day. It was\r\nexactly a month before that date, and a neighbour of an enthusiastic\r\ntradesman remarked upon the fact. \"I know,\" was the answer; \"I'll leave\r\nit there till the 14th of next month, and then I'll add two bigger ones\r\nto it.\" On the day proposed, not only were there none added, but the\r\noriginal one had also disappeared, for by that time the Second Empire\r\nwas virtually in the throes of death. The second thing I remember was\r\nthe enormous strip of calico outside a bookseller's shop, with the\r\nannouncement, \"Dictionnaire Français-Allemand à l'usage des Français à\r\nBerlin.\" In less than two months I read the following; it was an extract\r\nfrom the interview between Bismarck and Moltke on the one side and\r\nGeneral de Wimpffen on the other, on the eve of the capitulation of\r\nSedan: \"You do not know the topography of the environs of Sedan,\"\r\nreplied General von Moltke; \"and, seeing that we are on the subject, let\r\nme give you a small instance which thoroughly shows the presumption, the\r\nwant of method, of your nation. At the beginning of the campaign, you\r\nprovided your officers with maps of Germany, when they utterly lacked\r\nthe means of studying the geography of their own country, seeing that\r\nyou had no maps of your own territory.\" I could not help thinking of the\r\nbookseller, and wondering how many dictionaries he sold during those\r\nfirst few days.\r\n\r\nI did not get very far that night, only as far as the Maison d'Or, where\r\nI was perforce obliged to stop and look on. I stood for nearly an hour\r\nand a half, for there was no possibility of getting a seat, and during\r\nthat time I only heard one opinion adverse to the war. It was that of a\r\njustly celebrated dramatist, who is by no means hostile to either the\r\nEmperor or the Empire, albeit that he had declined several years ago to\r\nbe presented to Napoléon when Princess Mathilde offered him to do so. He\r\npositively hates the Germans, but his hatred did not blind him to their\r\ngreat intellectual qualities and to their powers of organization. \"It is\r\nall very fine to shout 'À Berlin!'\" he said; \"and it is very probable\r\nthat some of these bellowers (braillards) will get there, though not in\r\nthe order of procession they expect; they will be in front, and the\r\nGermans at their backs.\" He spoke very low, and begged me not to repeat\r\nwhat he had said. \"If I am mistaken, I do not want to be twitted with\r\nhaving thrown cold water on the martial ardour of my countrymen; if I am\r\nright, I will willingly forego the honour of having prophesied the\r\nhumiliation of my countrymen.\" That is why I suppress his name here, but\r\nI have often thought of his words since; and when people, Englishmen\r\nespecially, have accused him of having contributed to the corruption of\r\nthe Second Empire by his stage works, I have smiled to myself. With the\r\nexception of one, he has never written a play that did not teach a\r\nvaluable moral lesson; but he is an excellent husband, father, and son,\r\nthough he is perhaps not over generous with his money.\r\n\r\nI am bound to say that, though the noise on the Boulevards was terrific,\r\nand the crowds the densest I have ever seen in Paris or anywhere, they\r\nrefrained from that horse-play so objectionable in England under similar\r\ncircumstances. Of course there were exceptions; such as, for instance,\r\nthe demonstration at the Prussian Embassy: but, in the main, the\r\nbehaviour was orderly throughout. I do not know what might have been the\r\nresult of any foreigners--German or otherwise--showing themselves\r\nconspicuously, but they were either altogether absent, or else concealed\r\ntheir nationality as much as possible by keeping commendably silent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Parisian shopkeeper, who is the most arrant coward on\r\nthe face of the earth where a crowd is concerned, put up his shutters\r\nduring the whole of Saturday and Sunday, except those who professed for\r\ncater for the inner man. I doubt whether, on the first-named day, there\r\nwas a single stroke of work done by the three or four hundred thousand\r\nof Parisian artisans. I exclude cabmen, railway porters, and the like.\r\nThey had their hands full, because the exodus began before the war news\r\nwas four and twenty hours old. Our own countrymen seemed in the greatest\r\nhurry to put the Channel between themselves and France. If the enemy had\r\nbeen already at the gates of Paris their retreat could have been\r\nscarcely more sudden. The words \"bouches inutiles\" had as yet not been\r\npronounced or invented officially; but I have a notion that a cabman\r\nsuggested them first, in a conversation with a brother Jehu. \"Voilà des\r\nbouches utiles qui s'en vont, mon vieux,\" he said, while waiting on the\r\nPlace Vendôme to take passengers to the railway. Until then I had never\r\nheard the word used in that sense.\r\n\r\nApropos of cabmen, I heard a story that day for the truth of which I\r\nwill, however, not vouch. There was a cab-stand near the Prussian\r\nEmbassy, and most of the drivers knew every one of the attachés, the\r\nlatter being frequent customers. On the Saturday morning, a cab was\r\ncalled from the rank to take a young attaché to the eastern railway\r\nstation. He was going to join his regiment. On alighting from the cab,\r\nthe attaché was about to pay his fare; the driver refused the money. \"A\r\nman does not pay for his own funeral, monsieur; and you may take it that\r\nI have performed that office for you. Adieu, monsieur.\" With that he\r\ndrove off. True or not, the mere invention of the tale would prove that,\r\nat any rate, the lower middle classes were cocksure of the utter\r\nannihilation of the Germans.\r\n\r\nI happened to have occasion to go to the northern station on the Sunday,\r\nto see some one off by the mail. That large, cold, bare hall, which does\r\nduty as a waiting-room, was crowded, and a number of young Germans were\r\namong the passengers; respectable, stalwart fellows who, to judge by\r\ntheir dress, had occupied good commercial positions in the French\r\ncapital. Most of them were accompanied by friends or relations. They\r\nseemed by no means elated at the prospect before them, and scarcely\r\nspoke to one another. As a matter of course, they were scattered all\r\nover the place, in groups of three and four. I noticed that there was an\r\nexceedingly strong contingent of sergents de ville, and several couples\r\nof officiers de paix--what in England we should call superintendents of\r\npolice. The latter had evidently received particular instructions, for\r\nthey had posted, as much as possible, a sergent de ville close to every\r\ngroup. At first I mistook the drift of the supervision, but it was soon\r\nexplained to me when one of the officiers de paix came up to a group\r\nsomewhat larger than the others. \"Messieurs,\" he said very politely,\r\n\"vous êtes Allemands, et je vous prierai de vous mettre ensemble, afin\r\nde pouvoir vous protéger, s'il y a besoin.\" I heard afterwards that,\r\namidst all his weighty occupations, the Emperor himself had given orders\r\nto have the Germans especially protected, as he feared some violence on\r\nthe part of the Parisians.\r\n\r\nDuring the next week the excitement did not abate, but, save for some\r\nminor incidents, it was the same thing over and over again: impromptu\r\nprocessions along the main thoroughfares to the singing of the\r\n\"Marseillaise\" and the \"Chant du Départ,\" until the crowds had got by\r\nheart Alfred de Musset's \"Rhin Allemand,\" of which, until then, not one\r\nin a thousand had ever heard.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the news had spread of the suicide of Prévost-Paradol, the\r\nnewly appointed French ambassador at Washington, and the republicans\r\nwere trying to make capital out of it. According to them, it was\r\npolitical shame and remorse at having deserted his colours, despair at\r\nthe turn events were taking, that prompted the step. These falsehoods\r\nhave been repeated until they became legends connected with the fall of\r\nthe Second Empire. To the majority of Englishmen, Prévost-Paradol is not\r\neven a name; talented as he was, Frenchmen would have scarcely known\r\nmore about him if some politicians, for purposes of their own, had not\r\nchosen to convert him into a self-immolated martyr to the Imperialist\r\ncause--or, rather, to that part of the cause which aimed at the recovery\r\nof the left banks of the Rhine. I knew Prévost-Paradol, and he was only\r\ndistinguished from hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen in that his\r\n\"France Nouvelle\" was a magnificent attempt to spur his countrymen's\r\nambition in that direction; but this very fact is an additional argument\r\nagainst the alleged cause of his self-destruction. He shot himself\r\nduring the night of the 10th and 11th of July, when not the most\r\npessimistically inclined could foresee the certainty of a war, and,\r\nleast of all, the disastrous result of it to France. Those who would\r\nknow the real cause of Prévost-Paradol's suicide had better read a short\r\ntale that appeared anonymously in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ of\r\nFebruary, 1860. The hero of \"Madame de Marçay\" is none other than the\r\nbrilliant journalist himself, and the germs of suicidal mania were so\r\nplainly discernible in him, as to make those who knew the writer wonder\r\nthat he had not killed himself long before he did.\r\n\r\nI have already said that the excitement did not abate, but the more\r\nserious-minded began to look critical, and, among the latter, curiously\r\nenough, there were a good many superior officers in the army. They were\r\ntoo loyal to express openly their want of confidence in their leaders,\r\nbut it was evident enough to the careful listener that that want of\r\nconfidence did exist. I had a conversation during that week with one of\r\nthe former, whose name, for obvious reasons, I must suppress; and this\r\nis, as far as I can remember, what he said, knowing that he could trust\r\nme. \"There is not a single properly drawn ordnance map of France at the\r\nWar Office; and if there were, there is not a single man in power there\r\nwho would know how to use it. I doubt whether there is a settled plan of\r\ncampaign; they'll endeavour to conduct this war as they conducted the\r\nCrimean, Italian, and Mexican wars--that is, on the principle which\r\nstood them in such good stead in Algeria, though they ought to know by\r\nthis time how very risky those experiments turned out, especially in\r\n'59; and I have no need to tell you that we are going to confront a\r\ndifferent army from that of the Austrians or the Russians, Todleben\r\nnotwithstanding. The African school of warfare ought to be played out by\r\nnow, but it is not. To a certain extent, the Emperor is to blame for\r\nthis. You remember what his uncle said: 'There is not a single general\r\nof whose draught I am not aware. Some will go up to their waists; others\r\nup to their necks; others, again, to over their heads; but the latter\r\nnumber is infinitely small, I assure you.' The Emperor is not in the\r\nsame position with regard to the capacity of his generals, let alone of\r\nhis officers.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he ought to be,\" I objected; \"he interviews a great many of them on\r\nSunday mornings.\" I was alluding to the informal levée held at the\r\nTuileries every week, to which the generals and the general officers by\r\nsea and by land were admitted.\r\n\r\n\"You are right--he ought to be,\" was the answer; \"and if a great deal of\r\nconscientious trouble on his part could have put him in possession of\r\nsuch knowledge, he would have had it by this time. Of course, you have\r\nnever been present at such a reception; for all civilians, with the\r\nexception of a few ministers, are rigorously excluded. I repeat, the\r\nintention is a good one, but it is not carried out properly. The very\r\nfact that at the outset it met with the most strenuous opposition from\r\nnearly all the ministers and high dignitaries of the Imperial household\r\nought to have shown his Majesty the necessity of interviewing these\r\nofficers alone, without as much as a chambellan in waiting. As it is, do\r\nyou know what happens? I will tell you. The Emperor passes before these\r\nofficers as they are standing around the room, stops before nearly every\r\none to ask a question, inviting him, at the same time, to lodge a\r\nprotest if necessary against any standing abuse or to suggest a measure\r\nof reform. But the chambellan is close at his heels; the minister for\r\nwar, the marshal commanding the Imperial Guard, the military governor of\r\nParis, are standing but a few steps away. The officer to whom the\r\nquestion is addressed feels himself tongue-tied; he knows that all these\r\ncan hear every word he says, and, rather than be marked by his superiors\r\nas a tiresome meddler, he prefers to hold his tongue altogether--that\r\nis, if he be comparatively honest. Call it cowardice if you like, but\r\nmost men will tell you that such cowardice exists in all administrations\r\nwhether civil or military. Consequently, the Emperor, though he may know\r\na good many officers by name and by sight, in reality knows nothing of\r\ntheir capacities. I may safely say that, for the last fifteen or sixteen\r\nyears, there have not been a dozen important promotions, either in the\r\narmy or the navy, justified by the 'record of service' of the officer\r\npromoted. Divisions--nay, whole army corps--have been confided to men\r\nwho, in the hour of need, will, no doubt, prove very dashing and very\r\nplucky, but who have no more notion of handling large masses of men than\r\nan ordinary drill-sergeant. To use a more striking metaphor--they have\r\nselected the most desperate punters at baccarat to work out complicated\r\nchess problems. What the result will be with such a champion as Von\r\nMoltke, Heaven only knows. There are men at the head of our cavalry\r\nforces who can scarcely hold themselves on horseback; there are others\r\ncommanding divisions and even corps-d'armée who know all about bridges,\r\npontoons, artillery, and so forth, but who could no more execute a\r\nregularly organized retreat or advance than a child. The theory is that\r\ntheir dash and courage, their reckless, happy-go-lucky, but frequently\r\nsuccessful African system, will make up for their ignorance of tactics\r\nand strategy. Naturally this is an implied rather than an expressed\r\nopinion, for many of those favourites believe themselves to be the\r\nequals in these latter sciences of Jomini and Napoléon, perhaps of\r\nMoltke also. Do not misunderstand me; there are a number of officers in\r\nthe French army who have made a careful study of the science of war, and\r\nwho, in that respect, would favourably compare with an equal number of\r\nthe best instructed German officers, but they have by this time resigned\r\nthemselves to keep in the background, because any attempt on their part\r\nto raise the standard of military knowledge has for years been\r\nsystematically discountenanced by those nearest to the throne. On the\r\nother hand, the men thus kept at arm's length have not been altogether\r\nsatisfied to suffer in silence. I do not mean to say that they have\r\ngiven vent to their grievances openly; they have done worse, perhaps,\r\nfrom the point of view of maintaining the discipline of the army. They\r\nhave adopted a semi-critical, semi-hostile attitude towards their\r\nsuperiors. The officers' mess, such as it exists in England, is\r\nvirtually unknown on the Continent, and least of all in France. The\r\nunmarried officer takes his daily meals at the table d'hôte of an hotel,\r\nand he does talk 'shop' now and then in the presence of civilians. The\r\ncriticisms he utters do find their way to the barrack-room, so that by\r\nnow the private has become sceptical with regard to the capabilities of\r\nthe generals and marshals. The soldier who begins to question the\r\nfitness of his chiefs is like the priest who begins to question the\r\ninfallibility of the pope; he is a danger to the institution to which he\r\nbelongs.\"\r\n\r\nIn reality, my informant told me little that was new, though he perhaps\r\ndid not suspect that I was so well informed. I had heard most of all\r\nthis, and a great deal besides, from a connection of mine by marriage,\r\nwhose strictures in the same direction came with additional force,\r\nseeing that he was a frequent and welcome guest at the Tuileries. He was\r\na general officer, but, with a frankness that bordered on the cynical,\r\nmaintained that but for his capital voice and skill at leading \"the\r\ncotillon\" he would probably have never risen beyond the rank of captain;\r\n\"for there are a thousand captains that know a great deal more than I\r\ndo, a couple of thousand that know as much as I do, and very few who\r\nknow less, none of whom have ever been promoted, and never will be,\r\nunless they earn their promotion at the point of the sword.\" According\r\nto him, the \"records of service\" were not as much as looked into at the\r\nperiods of general promotions. \"A clever answer to one of the Emperor's\r\nquestions, a handsome face and pleasing manners, are sufficient to\r\nestablish a reputation at the Château. The ministers for war take\r\nparticular care not to rectify those impulsive judgments of the Emperor\r\nand Empress, because they rightly think that careful inquiries into the\r\ncandidates' merits would hurt their own protégés, and those of their\r\nfellow-ministers. This happy-go-lucky system--for a system it has\r\nbecome--founded upon the most barefaced nepotism, is condoned, by those\r\nwho ought to have opposed it with all their might and main at the very\r\noutset, on the theory that Frenchmen's courage is sure to make up in the\r\nend for all shortcomings, which theory in itself is a piece of\r\nimpertinence, or at any rate of overweening conceit, seeing that it\r\nimplies the absence of such courage in the officers of other nations.\r\nBut there is something else. All these favourites are jealous of one\r\nanother, and, mark my words, this jealousy will in this instance lead to\r\ndisastrous results, because the Emperor will find it as difficult to\r\ncomply with as to refuse their individual extravagant demands. The time\r\nis gone by for radical reforms. 'You cannot swap horses while crossing a\r\nstream,' said Abraham Lincoln; and we are crossing a dangerous stream.\r\nThe Emperor has, besides, a horror of new faces around him, and to\r\nextirpate the evil radically he would have to make a clean sweep of his\r\nmilitary household.\"\r\n\r\nI must preface the following notes by a personal remark. For private\r\nreasons, which I cannot and must not mention, I have decided not to put\r\nmy name to these jottings, whether they are published before or after my\r\ndeath. I am aware that by doing this I diminish their value; because,\r\nalthough I never played a political or even a social part in France, I\r\nam sufficiently well known to inspire the reader with confidence. As it\r\nis, he must take it for granted that I was probably the only foreigner\r\nwhom Frenchmen had agreed not to consider an enemy in disguise.\r\n\r\nWhile my relative was giving me the above résumé, I was already aware\r\nthat there existed in the French War Office a scheme of mobilization and\r\na plan of campaign elaborated by Marshal Niel, the immediate predecessor\r\nof Marshal Leboeuf. I knew, moreover, that this plan provided for the\r\nformation of three armies, under the respective commands of Marshals\r\nMacMahon, Bazaine, and Canrobert, and that the disposition of these\r\nthree armies had been the basis of negotiations for a Franco-Austrian\r\nalliance which had been started six weeks previous to the declaration of\r\nwar by General Lebrun in Vienna. Up till the 22nd or 23rd of July the\r\npreparations were carried out in accordance with that original project;\r\nthe respective staffs that had been appointed, the various regiments and\r\nbrigades distributed long ago, were already hurrying to the front, when\r\nall of a sudden the whole of this plan was modified; the three armies\r\nwere to be fused into one, to be called \"l'armée du Rhin,\" under the\r\nsole and exclusive command of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nWhence this sudden change? The historians, with their usual contempt for\r\nsmall causes, have endeavoured to explain it in various ways. According\r\nto some, the change was decided upon in order to afford the Emperor the\r\nopportunity of distinguishing himself; the \"armée du Rhin\" was to revive\r\nthe glories of the \"grande armée;\" there was to be a second edition of\r\nthe Napoleonic epic. After the first startling successes, the Emperor\r\nwas to return to the capital, and Marshal Niel's plan was, if\r\npracticable, to be taken up once more,--that is, the French troops,\r\nhaving established a foothold in the enemy's country, were to be divided\r\nagain under so many Klebers, Soults, and Neys.\r\n\r\nAccording to others, the Emperor, who until then had been living in a\r\nfool's paradise with regard to the quantity, if not with regard to the\r\nquality, of the forces at his disposal, suddenly had his eyes opened to\r\nthe real state of affairs. The six hundred and fifty thousand troops\r\nsupposed to be at his disposal had their existence mainly on paper: the\r\navailable reality did not amount to more than a third; _i. e._ to about\r\ntwo hundred and fifteen thousand troops of all arms.\r\n\r\nThe facts advanced by these historians are true, but they did not\r\ndetermine the change referred to--at any rate, not so far as the\r\nassumption of the supreme command by the Emperor himself was concerned.\r\nAnxious as the latter may have been, in the interest of his dynasty, to\r\nreap the glory of one or two successful battles fought under his\r\nimmediate supervision, he was fully aware of his unfitness for such a\r\ntask, especially in his actual state of health. Louis-Napoléon believed\r\nin his star, but he was not an idiot who counted upon luck to decide the\r\nfate of battles. If he had ever fostered such illusions, the campaign of\r\n1859 must have given a rude shock to them, for there he was, more than\r\nonce, within an ace of defeat; and no one knew this better than he did.\r\nThe fusing of the three armies into one was due, first, to the\r\ndifficulty, if not impossibility, of constituting three armies with\r\nconsiderably less than three hundred thousand troops; secondly, to the\r\ninveterate jealousy of his marshals of one another. Napoléon feared, and\r\njustly, that if those three armies went forth under three separate\r\ncommands, there would be a repetition of the quarrels that had occurred\r\nduring the Austro-Franco war, when Niel accused Canrobert of not having\r\nproperly supported him at the right time, and so forth. It will be\r\nremembered that the Emperor himself had to intervene to heal those\r\nquarrels. Under those circumstances, the Emperor thought it better to\r\nrisk it, and to take the whole responsibility upon himself.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor left St. Cloud on the 28th of July. It is very certain that,\r\neven before his departure, his confidence in the late Marshal Niel as an\r\norganizer must have been considerably shaken, and that the words of\r\nLeboeuf, \"We are ready, more than ready,\" sounded already a hollow\r\nmockery to his ear. Here are some of the telegrams which, after the 4th\r\nof September, were found among the papers at the Tuileries. They were\r\nprobably copies of the originals, though I am by no means certain that\r\nthey were forwarded to St. Cloud at the time of their reception. It\r\nwould have been better, perhaps, if they had been.\r\n\r\n\"Metz, 20 July, 1870, 9.50 a.m. From Chief of Commissariat Department to\r\nGeneral Blondeau, War Office, Paris. There is at Metz neither sugar,\r\ncoffee, rice, brandy, nor salt. We have but little bacon and biscuit.\r\nDespatch, at least, a million rations to Thionville.\"\r\n\r\n\"General Ducrot to War Office, Paris. Strasburg, 20 July, 1870, 8.30\r\np.m. By to-morrow there will be scarcely fifty men left to guard\r\nNeuf-Brisach; Fort-Mortier, Schlestadt, la Petite-Pierre, and\r\nLichtenberg are equally deserted. It is the result of the orders we are\r\ncarrying out. The Garde Mobile and local National Guards might easily be\r\nmade available for garrison duty, but I am reluctant to adopt such\r\nmeasures, seeing that your excellency has granted me no power to that\r\neffect. It appears certain that the Prussians are already masters of all\r\nthe passes of the Black Forest.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the General commanding the 2nd Army Corps to War Office, Paris.\r\nSaint-Avold, 21 July, 1870, 8.55 a.m. The dépôt sends enormous parcels\r\nof maps, which are absolutely useless for the moment. We have not a\r\nsingle map of the French frontier. It would be better to send greater\r\nquantities of what would be more useful, and which are absolutely\r\nwanting at this moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"From General Michael to War Office, Paris. Belfort, 21 July, 1870, 7.30\r\na.m. Have arrived at Belfort; did not find my brigade, did not find a\r\ngeneral of division. What am I to do? Do not know where are my\r\nregiments.\"\r\n\r\n\"From General commanding 4th Army Corps to Major-General, Paris.\r\nThionville, 21 July, 9.12 a.m. The 4th Corps has as yet neither\r\ncanteens, ambulances, nor baggage-waggons, either for the troops or the\r\nstaff. There is an utter lack of everything.\"\r\n\r\nI need quote no further; there were about two hundred missives in all,\r\nall dated within the week following the official declaration of war. It\r\nwould be difficult to determine how many of these the Emperor was\r\npermitted to see, but there is no doubt that he had a pretty correct\r\nidea of the state of affairs, for here is a fact which I have not seen\r\nstated anywhere, but for the truth of which I can vouch. For full two\r\nyears before the outbreak of hostilities, the Legislature seemed bent\r\nupon advocating all kinds of retrenchment in the war budget. During the\r\nfirst six months of 1870, the thing had almost become a mania with them,\r\nand the Emperor appealed to M. Thiers, through the intermediary of\r\nMarshal Leboeuf himself, to help him stem the tide of this\r\npseudo-economy. Thiers promised his support, and faithfully kept his\r\nword; but his aid came too late. The Emperor, however, felt grateful to\r\nhim, and, only thirty-six hours before his departure for the seat of\r\nwar, he offered him the portfolio of war, again through the intermediary\r\nof Marshal Leboeuf. The offer was respectfully declined, but what must\r\nhave been the state of mind of Louis-Napoléon with regard to his\r\nofficers, to prefer to them a civilian at such a critical moment? I may\r\nstate here that it was always the height of M. Thiers' ambition to be\r\nconsidered a great strategist and tactician, and also a military\r\nengineer. \"Jomini was a civilian,\" he frequently exclaimed. Those who\r\nwere competent to judge, have often declared that Thiers' pretensions in\r\nthat direction were, to a certain extent, justified by his talents.\r\nCuriously enough, M. de Freycinet is affected by a similar mania.\r\n\r\nHere is a certain correlative to the above-mentioned fact. When, a few\r\nmonths after the Commune, things were getting ship-shape in Paris, a\r\nlarge bundle of printed matter was unearthed in the erstwhile Imperial\r\n(then National) Printing Works. It contained, amongst others, a circular\r\ndrawn up by the Emperor himself, entitled \"A Bad Piece of Economy;\" it\r\nwas addressed to the deputies, and dated May, 1870; it showed the\r\npresumptive strength of the army of the North-German Confederation as\r\ncompared with that of France, and wound up with the following sentence:\r\n\"If we compare the military condition of North-Germany with ours, we\r\nshall be able to judge how far those who would still further reduce our\r\nnational forces are sufficiently enlightened as to our real interests.\"\r\n\r\nIt has always been a mystery to me, and to those who were aware of its\r\nexistence, why this circular was not distributed at the proper time;\r\nthough, by the light of subsequent events, one fails to see what good it\r\ncould have done then. Were these events foreseen at the Tuileries as\r\nearly as May? I think not. The majority of the Emperor's entourage were\r\nconfident that war with Germany was only a matter of time; very few\r\nconsidered it to be so imminent. One cannot for a moment imagine that\r\nthe suppression of this circular was due to accidental or premeditated\r\nneglect; for the sovereign, though ailing and low-spirited, was still\r\ntoo mindful of his prerogatives not to have visited such neglect of his\r\nwishes, whether intentional or not, with severe displeasure. Nor can one\r\nfor a moment admit that the Emperor was hoodwinked into the belief that\r\nthe circular had been distributed. His so-called advisers probably\r\nprevailed upon him to forego the distribution of the document, lest it\r\nshould open the eyes of the nation to the inferiority of France's\r\narmaments. The only man who had dared to point out that inferiority,\r\nthree years previously, was General Trochu, and his book, \"l'Armée\r\nFrançaise,\" had the effect of ostracizing him from the Tuileries. The\r\nsmart and swaggering colonels who surrounded the Empress did not scruple\r\nto spread the most ridiculous slanders with regard to its author; but\r\nthe Emperor, though aware that Trochu was systematically opposed to his\r\ndynasty, also knew that he was an able, perhaps the ablest soldier in\r\nthe country. The subsequent failure of Trochu does not invalidate that\r\njudgment. \"I know what Trochu could and would do if he were unhampered;\r\nbut I need not concern myself with that, seeing that he will be\r\nhampered,\" said Von Moltke at the beginning of the siege. Colonel\r\nStoffel, the French military attaché at Berlin, was severely reprimanded\r\nby Marshal Niel and by Leboeuf afterwards for his constant endeavours to\r\nacquaint the Emperor with the magnificent state of efficiency of the\r\nPrussian army and its auxiliaries. Ostensibly, it was because he had\r\nbeen guilty of a breach of diplomatic and military etiquette; in\r\nreality, because the minister for war and his \"festive\" coadjutors\r\nobjected to being constantly harassed in their pleasures by the\r\nsovereign's suspicions of their mental nakedness. \"Nous l'avons eu,\r\nvotre Rhin allemand.... Où le père a passé, passera bien l'enfant,\" was\r\ntheir credo; and they continued to dance, and to flirt, and to intrigue\r\nfor places, which, in their hands, became fat sinecures. They would have\r\nlaughed to scorn the dictum of the first Napoléon, that \"there are no\r\nbad regiments, only bad colonels;\" in their opinion, there were no bad\r\ncolonels, except those perhaps who did not constantly jingle their spurs\r\non the carpeted floors of the Empress's boudoir, and the parqueted arena\r\nof the Empress's ball-room. The Emperor was too much of a dreamer and a\r\nphilosopher for them; he could not emancipate himself from his German\r\neducation. The best thing to do was to let him write and print whatever\r\nhe liked, and then prevail upon him at the last moment not to publish,\r\nlest it might offend national vanity. Contemptuous as they were of the\r\nGerman spirit of plodding, they had, nevertheless, taken a leaf from an\r\neminent German's book. \"Let them say and write what they like, as long\r\nas they let me do what I like,\" exclaimed Frederick the Great, on one\r\noccasion. They slightly reversed the sentence. \"Let the Emperor say and\r\nwrite what he likes, as long as he lets us do what we like; and one\r\nthing we will take care to do, namely, not to let him publish his\r\nwritings.\" They had forgotten, if ever they knew them--for their\r\nignorance was as startling as their conceit--the magnificent lines of\r\nthe founder of the dynasty which they had systematically undermined for\r\nyears by their dissipation, frivolity, and corruption: \"The general is\r\nthe head, the all in all of the army. It was not the Roman army that\r\nconquered Gaul, but Cæsar; it was not the Carthaginian army that made\r\nthe republican army tremble at the very gates of Rome, but Hannibal; it\r\nwas not the Macedonian army that penetrated to the Indus, but Alexander;\r\nit was not the French army which carried the war as far as the Weser and\r\nthe Inn, but Turenne; it was not the Prussian army which defended,\r\nduring seven years, Prussia against the three greatest powers in Europe,\r\nbut Frederick the Great.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she who aspired to play the rôle of a Maria-Theresa, when she was\r\nnot even a Marie-Antoinette, and far more harmful than even a\r\nMarie-Louise, applauded the vapourings of those misguided men. \"Le\r\ncourage fait tout,\" had been the motto for nearly a score of years at\r\nthe Tuileries. It did a good deal in the comedies à la Marivaux, in the\r\nBoccacian charades that had been enacted there during that time; she had\r\nyet to learn that it would avail little or nothing in the Homeric\r\nstruggle which was impending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n     The war -- Reaction before the Emperor's departure -- The moral\r\n     effects of the publication of the draft treaty -- \"Bismarck has\r\n     done the Emperor\" -- The Parisians did not like the Empress --\r\n     The latter always anxious to assume the regency -- A retrospect\r\n     -- Crimean war -- The Empress and Queen Victoria -- Solferino --\r\n     The regency of '65 -- Bismarck's millinery bills -- Lord Lyons --\r\n     Bismarck and the Duc de Gramont -- Lord Lyons does not foresee\r\n     war -- The republicans and the war -- The Empress -- Two\r\n     ministerial councils and their consequences -- Mr.\r\n     Prescott-Hewett sent for -- Joseph Ferrari, the Italian\r\n     philosopher -- The Empress -- The ferment in Paris -- \"Too much\r\n     prologue to 'The Taming of the German Shrew'\" -- The first\r\n     engagement -- The \"Marseillaise\" -- An infant performer -- The\r\n     \"Marseillaise\" at the Comédie-Française -- The \"Marseillaise\" by\r\n     command of the Emperor -- A patriotic ballet -- The courtesy of\r\n     the French at Fontenoy -- The Café de la Paix -- General Beaufort\r\n     d'Hautpoul and Moltke -- Newspaper correspondents -- Edmond About\r\n     tells a story about one of his colleagues -- News supplied by the\r\n     Government -- What it amounted to -- The information it gave to\r\n     the enemy -- Bazaine, \"the glorious\" one -- Palikao -- The fall\r\n     of the Empire does not date from Sedan, but from Woerth and\r\n     Speicheren -- Those who dealt it the heaviest blow -- The\r\n     Empress, the Empress, and no one but the Empress.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven before the Emperor started for the seat of war it was very evident,\r\nto those who kept their eyes open, that a reaction had set in among the\r\nbetter classes. They were no longer confident about France's ability to\r\nchastise the arrogance of the King of Prussia. The publication of the\r\nfamous \"draft treaty\" had convinced them \"que Bismarck avait roulé\r\nl'empereur,\"--_anglicé_, \"that the Emperor had been bone;\" and,\r\nnotwithstanding their repeated assertions of being able to dispense with\r\nthe moral support of Europe, they felt not altogether resigned about the\r\nanimosity which the revelation of that document had provoked. Honestly\r\nspeaking, I do not think that they regretted the duplicity of\r\nLouis-Napoléon in having tried to steal a march upon the co-signatories\r\nof the treaty guaranteeing the protection of Belgium; but it wounded\r\ntheir pride that he should have been found out to no purpose. The word\r\n\"imbécile\" began to circulate freely; and when it became known that he\r\nhad conferred the regency upon the Empress, the expression of contempt\r\nand disapproval became stronger still. In spite of everything that has\r\nbeen said to the contrary, the Parisians did not like the Empress. I\r\nhave already noted elsewhere that those frankly hostile to her did not\r\nscruple to apply the word \"l'Espagnole\" in a depreciating sense; those\r\nwhose animosity did not go so far merely considered her \"une femme à la\r\nmode,\" and by no means fitted to take the reins of government,\r\nespecially under circumstances so grave as the present ones. On the\r\nother hand, the Empress always showed herself exceedingly anxious to\r\nexercise the functions of regent. The flatterers and courtiers around\r\nher had imbued her with the idea that she was a kind of Elizabeth and a\r\nCatherine in one, and the clerical element in her entourage was not the\r\nleast blamable in that respect.\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean war, Lord Clarendon had already been compelled to\r\ncombat the project, though he could not do so openly. Napoléon III. had\r\nseveral times expressed his intention of taking the command of the army.\r\nHis ministers, and especially MM. Troplong and Baroche, begged of him\r\nnot to do so. Even Queen Victoria, to whom the idea was broached while\r\non her visit to Paris, threw cold water upon it as far as was possible.\r\nBut the Empress encouraged it to her utmost. \"I fail to see,\" she said\r\nto our sovereign, \"that he would be exposed to greater dangers there\r\nthan elsewhere.\" It was the prospect of the regency, not of the glory\r\nthat might possibly accrue to her consort, that appealed to the Empress;\r\nfor in reality she had not the least sympathy with the object of that\r\nwar, any more than with that of 1859. Russia was ostensibly fighting for\r\nthe custody of the Holy Sepulchre; and the defeat of Austria, she had\r\nbeen told by the priests, would entail the ruin of the temporal power of\r\nthe pope. And Empress Eugénie never attained to anything more than\r\nparrot knowledge in the way of politics.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 1859 she had her wish, and, before the opening of the\r\ncampaign, she declared to the Corps Législatif that \"she had perfect\r\nfaith in the moderation of the Emperor when the right moment for peace\r\nshould have arrived.\" Her ladies-in-waiting and the male butterflies\r\naround her openly discounted the political effects of every engagement\r\non the field of battle. The Emperor, according to them, would make peace\r\nwith Austria with very few sacrifices on the latter's part, for it was a\r\nConservative and Catholic power, which could not be humiliated to the\r\nbitter end, while Italy was, after all, but a hotbed of conspiracy,\r\nrevolutionary, anti-Catholic, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAnd I know, for a positive fact, that the Emperor was, as it were,\r\ncompelled to suspend operations after Solferino, because the Minister\r\nfor War had ceased to send troops and ammunitions \"by order of the\r\nregent.\" The Minister for Foreign Affairs endeavoured by all means in\r\nhis power to alarm his sovereign.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in 1865, when he went to Algeria to seek some relief from\r\nhis acute physical sufferings, Napoléon III. was badgered into confiding\r\nthe regency once more to his wife. There is no other word, because there\r\nwas no necessity for such a measure, seeing that he did not leave French\r\nterritory. We have an inveterate habit of laughing at the \"henpecked\r\nhusband,\" and no essayist has been bold enough as yet to devote a\r\nchapter to him from a purely historical point of view. The materials are\r\nnot only at hand in France, but in England, Germany, and Russia also;\r\nabove all, in the latter country. He, the essayist, might safely leave\r\nCatherine de Medici out of the question. He need not go back as far. He\r\nmight begin with Marie de Medici and her daughter, Henrietta-Maria.\r\nSometimes the \"henpecking\" turns out to be for the world's benefit, as\r\nwhen Sophie-Dorothea worries her spouse to let her first boy wear a\r\nheavy christening dress and crown, which eventually kill the infant, who\r\nmakes room for Frederick the Great. But one could have very well spared\r\nthe servant-wench who henpecked Peter the Great, and Scarron's widow who\r\nhenpecked Louis XIV., and Marie-Antoinette and the rest.\r\n\r\nThe regency of '65, though perhaps not disastrous in itself, was fraught\r\nwith the most disastrous consequences for the future. It gave the\r\nEmpress the political importance which she had been coveting for years;\r\nhenceforth she made it a habit to be present at the councils of\r\nministers, who in their turn informed her personally of events which\r\nought to have remained strictly between them and the chief of the State.\r\nThis went on until M. Émile Ollivier came into power, January 2, 1870.\r\nThe Italian and Austrian ambassadors, however, continued to flatter her\r\nvanity by constantly appealing to her; the part they played on the 4th\r\nof September shows plainly enough how they profited in the interest of\r\ntheir governments by these seemingly diplomatic indiscretions on their\r\nown part.\r\n\r\nAs for Bismarck, as some one who was very much behind the political\r\nscenes in Berlin once said, \"His policy consisted in paying milliners'\r\nand dressmakers' bills in Paris for ladies to whose personal adornment\r\nand appearance he was profoundly indifferent.\" I am bound to say that\r\nLord Lyons courteously but steadfastly refused to be drawn out\r\n\"diplomatically\" by the Empress. While paying due homage to the woman\r\nand to the sovereign, he tacitly declined to consider her a pawn in the\r\npolitical game, and, though always extremely guarded in his language,\r\ncould scarcely refrain from showing his contempt for those who did. I do\r\nnot know whether Lord Lyons will leave behind any \"memoirs;\" if he do,\r\nwe shall probably get not only nothing but the truth, but the whole\r\ntruth, with regard to the share of the Empress in determining the war;\r\nand we shall find that that war was not decided upon between the\r\nImperial couple between the 14th and 15th of July, '70, but between the\r\n5th and 6th of July. Meanwhile, without presuming to anticipate such\r\nrevelations on the part of our ambassador, I may note here my own\r\nrecollections on the subject.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 5th of July, about 2.30 p.m., I was walking along the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Honoré, when, just in front of the Embassy, I was brought\r\nto a standstill by Lord Lyons' carriage turning into the courtyard from\r\nthe street. His lordship was inside. We were on very good terms, I may\r\nsay on very friendly terms, and he beckoned me to come in. I was at the\r\nshort flight of steps leading to the hall almost as soon as the\r\ncarriage, and we went inside together. I do not suppose I was in his\r\nprivate room for more than ten minutes, but I brought away the\r\nimpression that, although the Duc de Gramont and M. Émile Ollivier might\r\nthink it necessary to adopt a bellicose tone in face of the Hohenzollern\r\ncandidature, there was little or no fear of war, because the Emperor was\r\n_decidedly_ inclined to peace. I remember this the more distinctly,\r\nseeing that Lord Lyons told me that he had just returned from an\r\ninterview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am not certain of the\r\nexact words used by his lordship, but positive as to the drift of one of\r\nhis remarks; namely, that the Duc de Gramont was the last person who\r\nought to conduct the negotiations. \"There is too much personal animosity\r\nbetween him and Bismarck, owing mainly to the latter having laughed his\r\npretensions to scorn as a diplomatist while the duke was at Vienna.\" I\r\nam certain the words were to that effect. Then he added, \"I can\r\nunderstand though I fail to approve De Gramont's personal irritation,\r\nbut cannot account for Ollivier's, and he seems as pugnacious as the\r\nother. Nevertheless, I repeat, the whole of this will blow over: William\r\nis too wise a man to go to war on such a pretext, and the Emperor is too\r\nill not to want peace. I wish the Empress would leave him alone. I am\r\ngoing to Ollivier's to-night, and I'll know more about it by to-morrow\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very evident from this that the historians were subsequently\r\nwrongly informed as to M. Émile Ollivier's attitude at that moment,\r\nwhich they have described as exactly the reverse from what Lord Lyons\r\nfound it. I knew little or nothing of M. Ollivier, still he did not give\r\nme the impression of being likely to adopt a hectoring tone just in\r\norder to please the gallery, the gallery being in this instance the\r\nclientèle of the opposition, whom the Emperor feared more than any one\r\nelse. From all I have been able to gather since, Louis-Napoléon seemed\r\nracked with anxiety, but, as one of my informants, who was scarcely away\r\nfrom his side at the time, said afterwards, he was not pondering over\r\nthe consequences of war which he fancied he was able to prevent, he was\r\npondering the consequences of peace. Translated into plain language, it\r\nmeant that the republican minority, with its recent accession of\r\nrepresentatives in the chambers and its still more unscrupulous\r\nadherents outside, were striving with might and main, not to goad the\r\nEmperor into a war, but to make him keep a peace which, if they had had\r\nthe chance, they would have denounced as humiliating to France.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for France, they found an unexpected ally in the Empress.\r\nThe latter urged on the war with Prussia, in order to secure to her son\r\nthe imperial crown which was shaking on the head of her husband; the\r\nformer were playing the game known colloquially as \"Heads, I win; tails,\r\nyou lose.\" Peace preserved by means of diplomatic negotiations would\r\ngive them the opportunity of holding up the Empire to scorn as being too\r\nweak to safeguard the national honour; war would give them the\r\nopportunity of airing their platitudes about the iniquity of standing\r\narmies and the sacrifice of human life, etc. I go further still, and\r\nunhesitatingly affirm that, if any party was aware of the corruption in\r\nthe army, it was the republican one. The plébiscite of May, with its\r\nthousands of votes adverse to the Imperial régime--among which votes\r\nthere were those of a great many officers--had not only given them a\r\nchance of counting their numbers, but of obtaining information, not\r\navailable to their adversaries in power. This is tantamount to an\r\nindictment of having deliberately contributed to the temporary ruin of\r\ntheir country for political purposes, and such I intend it to be. I am\r\nnot speaking without good grounds.\r\n\r\nOn the day I met Lord Lyons, two ministerial councils were held at\r\nSaint-Cloud, both presided over by the Emperor. Between the first and\r\nthe second, the peaceful sentiments of the chief of the State underwent\r\nno change. So little did the Emperor foresee or desire war, that on the\r\nevening of that same day, while the second council of ministers was\r\nbeing held, he sent one of his aides-de-camp to my house for the exact\r\naddress of Mr. Prescott-Hewett, the eminent English surgeon. I was not\r\nat home, and on my return, an hour later, sent the address by telegraph\r\nto Saint-Cloud. I have since learnt that, on the same night, a telegram\r\nwas despatched to London, inquiring of Mr. Hewett when it would be\r\nconvenient for him to hold a consultation in Paris. An appointment was\r\nmade, but Mr. Hewett eventually went in August, to the seat of war, to\r\nsee his illustrious patient. I believe, but am not certain, that he saw\r\nhim at Châlons.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of July, there was a third council of ministers at\r\nSaint-Cloud, at ten o'clock in the morning, in order to draw up the\r\nanswer to M. Cochery's interpellation on the Hohenzollern candidature.\r\nThe latter was supposed to have been inspired by M. Thiers, but I will\r\nonly state what I know positively with regard to the Emperor. At a\r\nlittle after two that afternoon, I happened to be at the Café de la\r\nPaix, when my old friend, Joseph Ferrari, came up to me.[77] He was a\r\ngreat friend of Adolphe and Élysée, the brothers of Émile Ollivier. He\r\nlooked positively crestfallen, and, knowing him to be a sincere advocate\r\nof peace, I had no need to ask him for the nature of the news he\r\nbrought. I could see at a glance that it was bad. He, however, left me\r\nno time to put a question.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 77: Joseph Ferrari was an Italian by birth, but spent\r\n         a great part of his time in France. He is best known by his\r\n         \"Philosophes Salariés,\" and died in Rome, 1876.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"It's all over,\" he said at once, \"and, unless a miracle happens, we'll\r\nhave war in less than a fortnight.\" He immediately went on. \"Wait for\r\nanother hour, and then you'll see the effect of De Gramont's answer to\r\nCochery's interpellation in the Chamber. Not only the Prussians, but the\r\nsmallest nation in Europe would not stand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I remarked, \"about this time yesterday I was positively assured,\r\nand on the best authority, that the Emperor was absolutely opposed to\r\nany but a pacific remonstrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your informant was perfectly correct,\" was the answer; \"and as late as\r\nten o'clock last night, at the termination of the second council of\r\nministers, his sentiments underwent no change. Immediately after that,\r\nthe Empress had a conversation with the Emperor, which I know for\r\ncertain lasted till one o'clock in the morning. The result of this\r\nconversation is the answer, the text of which you will see directly, and\r\nwhich is tantamount to a challenge to Prussia. Mark my words, the\r\nEmpress will not cease from troubling until she has driven France into a\r\nwar with the only great Protestant power on the Continent. That power\r\ndefeated, she will endeavour to destroy the rising unity of Italy. She\r\nlittle knows that Victor-Emanuel will not wait until then, and that, at\r\nthe first success of the French on the Rhine, he will cross the Alps at\r\na sign of Prussia; that at the first success of Prussia, the Italian\r\ntroops will start on their march to Rome. Nay, I repeat, it is the\r\nEmpress who will prove the ruin of France.\"\r\n\r\nThat playful cry of the Empress, which she was so fond of uttering in\r\nthe beginning of her married life, \"As for myself, I am a Legitimist,\"\r\nwithout understanding, or endeavouring to understand its import, had\r\ngradually grafted itself on her mind, although it had ceased to be on\r\nher lips. Impatient of contradiction, self-willed and tyrannical, both\r\nby nature and training, her sudden and marvellous elevation to one of\r\nthe proudest positions in Europe could not fail to strengthen those\r\ndefects of character. Superstitious, like most Spaniards, she was firmly\r\nconvinced that the gipsy who foretold her future greatness was a Divine\r\nmessenger, and from that to the conviction that she occupied the throne\r\nby a right as Divine as that claimed by the Bourbons there was but one\r\nshort step. A corollary to Divine right meant, to her, personal and\r\nirresponsible government. That was her idea of legitimism. Though by no\r\nmeans endowed with high intellectual gifts, she perceived well enough,\r\nin the beginning, that the Second Empire was not a very stable edifice,\r\neither with regard to its foundations or superstructure, and, until\r\nEngland propped it up by an alliance, and a State visit from our\r\nsovereign, she kept commendably coy. But from that moment she aspired to\r\nbe something more than the arbiter of fashion. As I have already said,\r\nshe failed in prevailing upon the Emperor to go to the Crimea. In '59\r\nshe was more successful, in '65 she was more successful still. In the\r\nformer year, she laid the foundation of what was called the Empress's\r\nparty; in the latter, the scaffolding was removed from the structure,\r\nhenceforth the work was done inside. She, no more than her surroundings,\r\nhad the remotest idea that France was gradually undergoing a political\r\nchange, that she was recovering her constitutional rights. Her party was\r\nlike the hare in the fable that used the wrong end of the opera-glass,\r\nand lived in a fool's paradise with regard to the distance that divided\r\nthem from the sportsman, until he was fairly upon them, in the shape of\r\nthe liberal ministry of the 2nd of January, 1870.\r\n\r\nM. Émile Ollivier, to his credit be it said, refused to be guided by his\r\npredecessors. He studiously avoided informing the Empress of the affairs\r\nof State, let alone discussing them with her. Apart from the small fry\r\nof the Imperial party, he made two powerful enemies--the Empress\r\nherself, and Rouher, who saw in this refusal to follow precedent an\r\nimplied censure upon himself. Rouher, I repeat once more, was honest to\r\nthe backbone, but fond of personal power. The Empire to him meant\r\nnothing but the Emperor, the Empress, and the heir to the throne; just\r\nas Germany meant nothing to Bismarck but the Hohenzollern dynasty. He\r\nwas one of the first to proclaim, loudly and openly, that the plébiscite\r\nof the 8th of May meant an overwhelming manifestation, not in favour of\r\nthe liberal Empire, but in favour of the Emperor; and when the latter,\r\nto do him justice, declined to look at it in that light, he deserted him\r\nfor the side of his wife. It is an open secret that the first use the\r\nEmpress meant to make of her power as regent, after the first signal\r\nvictory of French arms, was to sweep away the cabinet of the 2nd of\r\nJanuary. The Imperial decree conferring the regency upon her, \"during\r\nthe absence of the Emperor at the head of his army,\" and dated the 22nd\r\nof July, invested her with very limited power.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, pending the departure of the Emperor, Paris was in a\r\nferment, but, to the careful observer, it was no longer the unalloyed\r\nenthusiasm of the first few days. There were just as many people in the\r\nstreets; the shouts of \"À Berlin!\" though, perhaps, not so sustained,\r\nwere just as loud every now and then; the troops leaving for the front\r\nreceived tremendous ovations, and more substantial proofs of the\r\npeople's goodwill; the man who dared to pronounce the word \"peace\" ran a\r\ngreat risk of being rent to pieces by the crowds--a thing which almost\r\nhappened one night in front of the Café de Madrid, on the Boulevard\r\nMontmartre: still, the enthusiasm was not the same. \"There seems to be a\r\ngreat deal of prologue to 'The Taming of that German Shrew,'\" said a\r\nFrench friend, who was pretty familiar with Shakespeare; and he was not\r\nfar wrong, for the Christopher Sly abounded. The bivouacs of the troops\r\nabout to take their departure reminded one somewhat more forcibly of\r\noperatic scenes and equestrian dramas of the circus type than of the\r\npreparations for the stern necessities of war--with this difference,\r\nthat the contents of the goblet were real, and the viands not made of\r\ncardboard. \"They are like badly made cannons, these soldiers,\" said some\r\none else: \"they are crammed up to the muzzle, and they do not go off.\"\r\nIn short, the more sensible of the Paris population began to conclude\r\nthat a little less intoning of patriotic strophes and a good deal more\r\nof juxtaposition with the German troops was becoming advisable. The\r\nreports of the few preliminary skirmishes that had taken place were no\r\ndoubt favourable to the French; at the same time, there was no denying\r\nthe fact that they had taken place on French and not on German\r\nterritory, which was not quite in accordance with the spirit of the\r\noft-repeated cry of \"À Berlin!\" In accordance with the programme of\r\nwhich that cry was the initial quotation, the French ought, by this\r\ntime, to have been already half on their way to the Prussian capital.\r\nThat is what sensible, nay, clever people expressed openly.\r\nNevertheless, the cry continued, nor was there any escape from the\r\n\"Marseillaise,\" either by day or night. Every now and then a more than\r\nusually dense group might be seen at a street corner. The centre of the\r\ngroup was composed of a woman, with a baby in her arms; the little one\r\ncould scarcely speak, but its tiny voice reproduced more or less\r\naccurately the air of the \"Marseillaise:\" a deep silence prevailed\r\nduring the performance in order to give the infant a fair chance;\r\ndeafening applause greeted the termination of the solo, and a shower of\r\ncoppers fell into the real or pseudo mother's lap. On the 18th of July,\r\nthe day of the official declaration of war in Paris, the\r\nComédie-Française performed \"Le Lion Amoureux\" of Ponsard.[78] At the\r\nend of the second act, the public clamoured for the \"Marseillaise.\"\r\nThere was not a single member of the company capable of complying with\r\nthe request, \"so the stage manager for the week\" had to come forward and\r\nask for a two-days' adjournment, during which some one might study it.\r\nOf course, _the honour_ of singing the revolutionary hymn was to devolve\r\nupon a woman, according to the precedent established in '48, when Rachel\r\nhad intoned it. From what I learnt a few days afterwards, the candidates\r\nfor the _distinguished task_ were not many, in spite of the tacit\r\nconsent of the Government. The ladies of the company, most of whom, like\r\ntheir fellow-actors, had been always very cordially treated by the\r\nEmperor on the occasion of their professional visits to Saint-Cloud,\r\nCompiègne, and Fontainebleau, instinctively guessed the pain the\r\nconcession must have caused the chief of the State, and under some\r\npretext declined. Mdlle. Agar accepted, and sang the \"Marseillaise,\" in\r\nall forty-four times, from the 20th of July to the 17th of September,\r\nthe day of the final investment of the capital by the German armies.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 78: I believe there exists an English version of the\r\n         play, entitled \"A Son of the Soil.\" I am not certain of the\r\n         title.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, though, that the Government had waited until\r\nthe day of the official declaration of war to sanction the performance\r\nof the \"Marseillaise\" in places of public resort. I remember crossing\r\nthe Gardens of the Tuileries in the afternoon of Sunday, the 17th of\r\nJuly. One of the military bands was performing a selection of music. The\r\ncustom of doing so during the summer months has prevailed for many\r\nyears, both in the capital and in the principal garrison towns of the\r\nprovinces. All at once they struck up the \"Marseillaise.\" I looked with\r\nsurprise at my companion, a member of the Emperor's household. He caught\r\nthe drift of my look.\r\n\r\n\"It is by the Emperor's express command,\" he said. \"It is the national\r\nwar-song. In fact, it is that much more than a revolutionary hymn.\"\r\n\r\n\"But war has not been declared,\" I objected.\r\n\r\n\"It will be to-morrow,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nThe public, which in this instance was mainly composed of the better\r\nclasses, apparently refused to consider the \"Marseillaise\" a national\r\nwar-song, and applause at its termination was but very lukewarm.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the scene I witnessed in connection with the\r\ndeparture of the Germans on that same Sunday early in the morning, and\r\nhave also noted the demonstration in front of the German Embassy on the\r\nprevious Friday night. I will not be equally positive with regard to the\r\nexact dates of the succeeding exhibitions of bad taste on the part of\r\nthe Parisians, but I remember a very striking one which happened between\r\nthe official declaration of war and the end of July. It was brought\r\nunder my notice, not by a foreigner, but by a Frenchman, who was\r\nabsolutely disgusted with it. We were sitting one evening outside the\r\nCafé de la Paix, which, being the resort of some noted Imperialists, I\r\nhad begun to visit more frequently than I had done hitherto. There was a\r\nterrible din on the Boulevards: the evening papers had just published a\r\nvery circumstantial account of that insignificant skirmish which cost\r\nLieutenant Winslow his life, and in which the French had taken a couple\r\nof prisoners. \"They\" (the prisoners), suggested an able editor, \"ought\r\nto be brought to Paris and publicly exhibited as an example.\" \"And, what\r\nis more,\" said my friend who had read the paragraph to me, \"he means\r\nwhat he says. These are the descendants of a nation who prides herself\r\non having said at Fontenoy, 'Messieurs, les Anglais tirez les premiers,'\r\nwhich, by-the-by, they did not say.[79] If you care to come with me,\r\nI'll show you what would be the probable fate of such prisoners if the\r\nwriter of that paragraph had his will.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 79: It was, in fact, an English officer who shouted,\r\n         \"Messieurs des gardes françaises, tirez;\" to which the French\r\n         replied, \"Messieurs, nous ne tirons jamais les premiers; tirez\r\n         vous mêmes.\" But it was not politeness that dictated the reply;\r\n         it was the expression of the acknowledged and constantly\r\n         inculcated doctrine that all infantry troops which fired the\r\n         first were indubitably beaten. We find the doctrine clearly\r\n         stated in the infantry instructions of 1672, and subsequently\r\n         in the following order of Louis XIV. to his troops: \"The\r\n         soldier shall be taught not to fire the first, and to stand the\r\n         fire of the enemy, seeing that an enemy who has fired is\r\n         assuredly beaten when his adversary has his powder left.\" At\r\n         the battle of Dettingen, consequently, two years before\r\n         Fontenoy, the theory had been carried _beyond_ the absurd by\r\n         expressly forbidding the Gardes to fire, though they were raked\r\n         down by the enemy's bullets. Maurice de Saxe makes it a point\r\n         to praise the wisdom of a colonel who, in order to prevent his\r\n         troops from firing, constantly made them shoulder their\r\n         muskets.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nSo said; so done. In about a quarter of an hour we were seated at the\r\nCafé de l'Horloge, in the Champs Élysées, and my friend was holding out\r\nfive francs fifty centimes in payment for two small glasses of so-called\r\n\"Fine Champagne,\" _plus_ the waiter's tip. The admission was gratis; and\r\nthe difference between those who went in and those who remained outside\r\nwas that the latter could hear the whole of the performance without\r\nseeing it, and without disbursing a farthing; while the former could see\r\nthe whole of the performance without hearing a note, for the din there\r\nwas also infernal. Shortly after our arrival, the band struck up the\r\ninevitable \"Marseillaise,\" but the audience neither listened nor\r\napplauded.\r\n\r\nThis was, after all, but the overture to the entertainment to which my\r\nfriend had invited me, and which consisted of a spectacular pantomime\r\nrepresenting an engagement between a regiment or a battalion of Zouaves\r\nand Germans. As a matter of course, the latter had the worst of it; and,\r\nat the termination, a couple of them were brought in and compelled to\r\nsue for mercy on their knees. I am bound to say that the thing hung fire\r\naltogether, and that, but for the remarkable selection of handsome legs\r\nof the Zouaves, not even the hare-brained young fellows with which the\r\naudience was largely besprinkled would have paid any attention.\r\n\r\nIn the whole of Paris there was no surer centre of information of the\r\nstate of affairs at the front than the Café de la Paix. It was the\r\nprincipal resort of the Bonapartists. There were Pietri, the prefect of\r\npolice, Sampierro, Abatucci, and a score or two of others; all\r\ncultivating excellent relations with the Château. There was also the\r\nGeneral Beaufort d'Hautpoul, to whom Bismarck subsequently, through the\r\npen of Dr. Moritz Busch, did the greatest injury a man can do to a\r\nsoldier, in accusing him of drunkenness when he came to settle some of\r\nthe military conditions of the armistice at Versailles. He was, as far\r\nas I remember, one of the two superior French officers who estimated at\r\nits true value the strategic genius of Von Moltke. The other was Colonel\r\nStoffel. But General d'Hautpoul was even better enabled to judge; he had\r\nseen Moltke at work in Syria more than thirty years before. He was in\r\nreality the Solomon Eagle of the campaign, before a single shot had been\r\nfired. \"I know our army, and I know Helmuth von Moltke,\" he said,\r\nshaking his head despondingly. \"If every one of our officers were his\r\nequal in strategy, the chance would then only be equal. Moltke has the\r\ngift of the great billiard-player; he knows beforehand the exact results\r\nof a shock between two bodies at a certain angle. We are a doomed\r\nnation.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, his friends were very wroth at what they called\r\n\"his unpatriotic language,\" and when the news of the engagement at\r\nSaarbruck arrived they crowed over him; but he stuck to his text. \"It is\r\nsimply a feint on Moltke's part, and proves nothing at all. In two or\r\nthree days we'll get the news of a battle that will decide, not only the\r\nfate of the whole campaign, but the fate of the Empire also.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards, I met him near the Rue Saint-Florentin; he looked\r\nabsolutely crestfallen. \"We have suffered a terrible defeat near\r\nWissembourg, but do not breathe a word of it to any one. The Government\r\nis waiting for a victory on some other point, and then it will publish\r\nthe two accounts together.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government was reckoning without the newspapers, French and foreign.\r\nThe latter might be confiscated, and in fact were, such as the _Times_\r\nand _l'Indépendance Belge_; but the French, notwithstanding the\r\ntemporary law of M. Émile Ollivier, were more difficult to deal with. I\r\nam inclined to think that if they had foreseen the terrible fate that\r\nwas to befall the French armies they would have been more amenable, but\r\nin the beginning they anticipated nothing but startling victories, and,\r\nas such, looked upon the campaign in the light of a series of brilliant\r\nspectacular performances, glowing accounts of which were essentially\r\ncalculated to increase their circulation. When MM. Cardon and\r\nChabrillat, respectively of the _Gaulois_ and _Figaro_, were released by\r\nthe Prussians, they told many amusing stories to that effect,\r\nunconsciously confirming the opinion I have already expressed; but the\r\nfollowing, which I had from the lips of Edmond About himself, is better\r\nthan any I can remember.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of one of the best Paris newspapers, on his arrival at\r\nthe head-quarters of \"the army of the Rhine,\" applied to the\r\naide-major-general for permission to follow the operations. He had a\r\ngood many credentials of more or less weight; nevertheless the\r\naide-major-general, in view of the formal orders of the Emperor and\r\nMarshal Leboeuf, felt bound to refuse the request. The journalist, on\r\nthe other hand, declined to take \"no\" for an answer. \"I have come with\r\nthe decided intention to do justice, and more than justice, perhaps, to\r\nyour talent and courage, and it would be a pity indeed if I were not\r\ngiven the opportunity,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry,\" was the reply; \"but I cannot depart from the rules\r\nfor any one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But our paper has a very large circulation.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the more reason to refuse you the authorization to follow the\r\nstaff.\"\r\n\r\nThe journalist would not look at matters in that light. He felt that he\r\nwas conferring a favour, just as he would have felt in offering the\r\nadvantage of a cleverly written puff of a première to a theatrical\r\nmanager. Seeing that his arguments were of no avail, he delivered his\r\nparting shot.\r\n\r\n\"This, then, general, is your final decision. I am afraid you'll have\r\ncause to regret this, for we, on our side, are determined not to give\r\nthis war the benefit of publicity in our columns.\"\r\n\r\nM. Émile Ollivier's original decision was the right one, but, instead of\r\nembodying it in a temporary and exceptional order, he ought to have made\r\nit a permanent law in times of peace as well as war. On Saturday, the\r\n16th of July, Count Culemburg, the Prussian Minister of the Interior,\r\naddressed a circular to the German papers, recommending them to abstain\r\nfrom giving any news, however insignificant, with regard to the\r\nmovements of the troops. As far as I remember, the German editors\r\nneither protested, nor endeavoured to shirk the order; they raised no\r\noutcry against \"the muzzling of the press.\" Five days later, the French\r\nminister was attacked by nearly every paper in France for attempting to\r\ndo a similar thing, and, rather than weather that storm in a teacup, he\r\nconsented to a compromise, and condescended to ask where he might have\r\ncommanded. In addition to this, he undertook that the Government itself\r\nshould be the purveyor of war-news to the papers. Every editor of\r\nstanding in Paris knew that this meant garbled, if not altogether\r\nmythical, accounts of events, and that even these would be held back\r\nuntil they could be held back no longer. In a few days their worst\r\napprehensions in that respect were confirmed. While Paris was still\r\nignorant of the terrible disaster at Wissembourg, the whole of Europe\r\nrang with the tidings. Then came the false report of a brilliant victory\r\nfrom the Government agency. It made the Parisians frantic with joy, but\r\nthe frenzy changed into one of anger when the truth became known through\r\nthe maudlin and lachrymose despatches from the Imperial head-quarters,\r\nalbeit that they by no means revealed the whole extent of the defeats\r\nsuffered at Woerth and Spicheren.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the _agency_ continued the even--or rather uneven--tenor\r\nof its way up to the last. The Republicans subsequently adopted the\r\ntactics of the Imperial Government, the Communists adhered to the system\r\nof those they had temporarily ousted. In the present note, I will deal\r\nonly with events up to the 4th of September. Patent as it must have been\r\nto the merest civilian, that the commanders were simply committing\r\nblunder after blunder, the movements of Bazaine were represented by the\r\n_agency_ as the result of a masterly and profound calculation. Even such\r\na pessimist as General Beaufort d'Hautpoul was taken in by those\r\nrepresentations. He considered the \"masterly inactivity\" of Bazaine as\r\nan inspiration of genius. \"He is keeping two hundred thousand German\r\ntroops round Metz,\" he said several times. \"These two hundred thousand\r\nmen are rendered absolutely useless while we are recruiting our armies\r\nand reorganizing our forces.\" He seemed altogether oblivious of the fact\r\nthat these two hundred thousand Germans were virtually the gaolers of\r\nFrance's best army.\r\n\r\nI am unable to say whether General d'Hautpoul was in direct or indirect\r\ncommunication with the _agency_, or whether some ingenious scribe\r\nbelonging to it had overheard his expressions of admiration and wilfully\r\nadopted them; certain it is that the _agency_ was the first to inspire\r\nthe reporters of those papers who took their cue from it with the\r\nflattering epithet of \"glorious Bazaine.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the same with regard to Palikao. His sententious commonplaces\r\nwere reported as so many oracular revelations dragged reluctantly from\r\nhim. Had they been more familiar with Shakespeare than they were, or\r\nare, the scribes would have made Palikao exclaim with Macbeth, \"The\r\ngreatest is behind.\" And all the while the troops were marching and\r\ncountermarching at haphazard, without a preconceived plan, jeering at\r\ntheir leaders, and openly insulting the \"phantom\" Emperor, as they did\r\nat Châlons, for he was already no more than that. The fall of the Empire\r\ndoes not date from Sedan, but from Woerth and Spicheren; and those most\r\npertinently aware of it were not the men who dealt it the final blow\r\nless than a month later, but the immediate entourage of the Empress at\r\nthe Tuileries.\r\n\r\nFor from that moment (the 6th or 7th of August) the entourage of the\r\nEmpress began to think of saving the Empire by sacrificing, if needs be,\r\nthe Emperor. \"There is only one thing that can avert the ruin of the\r\ndynasty,\" said a lady-in-waiting on the Empress, to a near relative of\r\nmine; \"and that is the death of the Emperor at the head of his troops.\r\nThat death would be considered an heroic one, and would benefit the\r\nPrince Imperial.\"\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to determine how far the Empress shared that opinion,\r\nbut here are some facts not generally known, even to this day, and for\r\nthe truth of which I can unhesitatingly vouch.\r\n\r\nThe Empress did not know of the consultation that had taken place on the\r\n1st of July, and to which I have already referred. But she did know that\r\nthe Emperor was suffering from a very serious complaint, and that the\r\ndisease had been aggravated since his departure through his constantly\r\nbeing on horseback. M. Franceschini Pietri, the private secretary of the\r\nEmperor, had informed her to that effect on the 7th of August, when\r\nForbach and Woerth had been fought. He also told her that the Emperor\r\nwas not unwilling to return to Paris, and to leave the command-in-chief\r\nto Bazaine, but that his conscience and his pride forbade him to do so,\r\nunless some pressure were brought to bear upon him. I repeat, I can\r\nvouch for this, because I had it from the lips of M. Pietri, who was\r\nprefect of police until the 4th of September.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, others, besides M. Franceschini Pietri, had noticed the\r\nevident moral and mental depression of the Emperor, increased, no doubt,\r\nby his acute physical sufferings, which were patent to almost every one\r\nwith whom he came in immediate contact; for an eye-witness wrote to me\r\non the 4th of August: \"The Emperor is in a very bad state; after\r\nSaarbruck, Lebrun and Leboeuf had virtually to lift him off his horse.\r\nThe young prince, who, as you have probably heard already, was by his\r\nside all the time, looked very distressed, for his father had scarcely\r\nspoken to him during the engagement. But after they got into the\r\ncarriage, which was waiting about a dozen yards away, the Emperor put\r\nhis arm round his neck and kissed him on the cheeks, while two large\r\ntears rolled down his now. I noticed that the Emperor had scarcely\r\nstrength to walk that dozen yards.\"\r\n\r\nLeboeuf, who, like a great many more, has suffered to a certain extent\r\nfor the faults of Marshal Niel, perceived well enough that something had\r\nto be done to cheer the Emperor in his misfortunes. It was he who\r\nproposed that the latter should return to Paris, accompanied by him,\r\nwhile the corps d'armée of Frossard, which had effected its retreat in\r\ngood order, and several other divisions that had not been under fire as\r\nyet, should endeavour to retrieve matters by attacking the armies of Von\r\nSteinmetz and Frederick-Charles, which at that identical moment were\r\nonly in \"course of formation.\" But Louis-Napoléon, while admitting the\r\nwisdom of the plan, sadly shook his head, and declared that he could not\r\nrelinquish the chief command in view of the double defeat the army had\r\nsuffered under his leadership.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened, then, during the twenty-four hours immediately\r\nfollowing the telegram of M. Franceschini Pietri? Simply this: not only\r\nhad the Empress refused to exercise the pressure which would have\r\nafforded her husband an excuse for his return, but she had thrown cold\r\nwater on the idea of that return by a despatch virtually\r\ndiscountenancing that return. The cabinet had not been consulted in this\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nNay, more; the cabinet on the 7th of August despatched, in secret, M.\r\nMaurice Richard, Minister of Arts, which at that time was distinct from\r\nthe Ministry of Public Instruction, to inquire into the state of health\r\nof the Emperor and the degree of confidence with which he inspired the\r\ntroops. That was on the 7th of August. He went by special train to Metz.\r\nTwo hours after he was gone, Adolphe Ollivier told me and Ferrari at the\r\nCafé de la Paix. A few hours after his return next day, he told us the\r\nresult of those inquiries. M. Richard had brought back the worst\r\npossible news.\r\n\r\nAt a council of ministers, held early on the 9th, M. Émile Ollivier, in\r\nview of the communication made to him by his colleague, proposed the\r\nimmediate return of the Emperor, fully expecting M. Richard to support\r\nhim. The Empress energetically opposed the plan, and when M. Ollivier\r\nturned, as it were, to M. Richard, the latter kept ominously silent. Not\r\nto mince matters, he had been tampered with. M. Ollivier found himself\r\nabsolutely powerless.\r\n\r\nA day or so before that--I will not be positive as to the date--M.\r\nOllivier telegraphed officially to the head-quarters at Metz, to request\r\nthe return of the Prince Imperial, in accordance with the generally\r\nexpressed wish of the Paris papers. M. Pietri told me that same day that\r\nthe minister's telegram had been followed by one in the Empress's\r\nprivate cipher, expressing her wish that the Prince Imperial should\r\nremain in the army. She did not explain why. She merely recommended the\r\nEmperor to make the promise required, and then to pay no further heed to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe regent had no power to summon parliament, nevertheless she did so,\r\nmainly in order to overthrow the Ollivier ministry. I am perfectly\r\ncertain that the Emperor never forgave her for it. If those who were at\r\nChislehurst are alive when these notes appear, they will probably bear\r\nme out.\r\n\r\nWhat, in fact, could a parliament summoned under such circumstances be\r\nbut a council of war, every one of whose decisions was canvassed in\r\npublic and made the enemy still wiser than he was before? Of course, the\r\nEmpress felt certain that she would be able to dismiss it as easily as\r\nit had been summoned; she evidently did not remember the fable of the\r\nhorse which had invited the man to get on his back in order to fight the\r\nstag. There is not the slightest doubt that, as I have already remarked,\r\nthe Empress's main purpose was the overthrow of the Ollivier\r\nadministration; if proof were wanted, the evidence of the men who\r\noverthrew the Empire would be sufficient to establish the fact, and not\r\none, but half a dozen, have openly stated that the defeat of the\r\nOllivier ministry was accomplished with the tacit approval of the court\r\nparty: _read_, \"the party of the Empress,\" to which I have referred\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe list of the Empress's blunders, involuntary or the reverse, is too\r\nlong to be transcribed in detail here; I return to my impressions of men\r\nand things after my meeting with General Beaufort d'Hautpoul in the Rue\r\nde Rivoli.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that in the whole of Paris there were a dozen sensible\r\nmen who still cherished any illusions with regard to the possibility of\r\nretrieving the disasters by a dash into the enemy's country. The cry of\r\n\"À Berlin!\" had been finally abandoned even by the most chauvinistic.\r\nBut the hope still remained that the Prussians would be thrust back from\r\nthe \"sacred soil of France\" by some brilliant coup de main, although I\r\nam positive that the Empire would have been doomed just the same if\r\nthat hope had been realized. Among those who had faith in the coup de\r\nmain were M. Paul de Cassagnac and, curiously enough, General Beaufort\r\nd'Hautpoul. He had suddenly conceived great hopes with regard to\r\nBazaine. M. de Cassagnac seriously contemplated enlisting in the\r\nZouaves. Strange to relate, M. Paul de Cassagnac, in spite of his\r\nwell-known attachment to the Imperialist cause, was looked upon, by the\r\nmost determined opponents of that cause among the masses, as a man to be\r\ntrusted and consulted in a non-official way. I remember being on the\r\nBoulevard one evening after the affair at Beaumont, when the rage of the\r\npopulation was even stronger than after the defeats at Woerth and\r\nForbach. All of a sudden we perceived a dense group swaying towards\r\nus--we were between the Rues Laffite and Le Peletier--and in the centre\r\ntowered the tall figure of M. de Cassagnac. For a moment we were afraid\r\nthat some mischief was being contemplated, the more that we had noticed\r\nseveral leaders of the revolutionary party--or, to speak by the card, of\r\nthe Blanqui party--hovering near the Café Riche. But the demonstration\r\nwas not a hostile one; on the contrary, it had a friendly tendency, and\r\nshowed a tacit acknowledgment that, whosoever else might hide the truth\r\nfrom them, M. de Cassagnac would not do so. \"What about rifles, M.\r\nPaul?\" was the cry; \"are there sufficient for us all?\" It must be\r\nremembered that the _levée en masse_ had been decreed. M. de Cassagnac\r\ncould not tell the truth, and would not tell a lie. He frankly said, \"I\r\ndon't know.\" We noticed also that at his approach the Blanquists slunk\r\naway. The Empire had been tottering on its base until then; after\r\nBeaumont it was virtually doomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n     The 4th of September -- A comic, not a tragic revolution -- A\r\n     burlesque Harold and a burlesque Boadicea -- The news of Sedan\r\n     only known publicly on the 3rd of September -- Grief and\r\n     consternation, but no rage -- The latter feeling imported by the\r\n     bands of Delescluze, Blanqui, and Félix Pyat -- Blanqui, Pyat, &\r\n     Co. _versus_ Favre, Gambetta, & Co. -- The former want their\r\n     share of the spoil, and only get it some years afterwards --\r\n     Ramail goes to the Palais-Bourbon -- His report -- Paris spends\r\n     the night outdoors -- Thiers a second-rate Talleyrand -- His\r\n     journey to the different courts of Europe -- His interview with\r\n     Lord Granville -- The 4th of September -- The Imperial eagles\r\n     disappear -- The joyousness of the crowd -- The Place de la\r\n     Concorde -- The gardens of the Tuileries -- The crowds in the Rue\r\n     de Rivoli scarcely pay attention to the Tuileries -- The soldiers\r\n     fraternizing with the people, and proclaiming the republic from\r\n     the barracks' windows -- A serious procession -- Sampierro Gavini\r\n     gives his opinion -- The \"heroic struggles\" of an Empress, and\r\n     the crownless coronation of \"le Roi Pétaud\" -- Ramail at the\r\n     Tuileries -- How M.

Carefully and scrupulously\r\ndovetailed, they constitute one vast burlesque of a revolution. It is\r\nnot because the overthrow of the Second Empire was accomplished without\r\nbloodshed that I say this. Bloodshed would have only made the burlesque\r\nmore gruesome, but it could have never converted it into a tragedy, the\r\nrecollection of which would have made men think and shudder even after\r\nthe lapse of many years. As it is, the recollection of the 4th of\r\nSeptember can only make the independent witness smile. On the one hand,\r\na burlesque Harold driven off to Wilhelmshöhe in a landau, surrounded by\r\na troop of Uhlans; and a burlesque Boadicea slinking off in a hackney\r\ncab, _minus_ the necessary handkerchiefs for the cold in her\r\nhead,--\"fleeing when no one pursueth,\" instead of poisoning herself: on\r\nthe other, \"ceux qui prennent la parole pour autrui,\" _i. e._ the\r\nlawyers, prenant le pouvoir pour eux-mêmes. Really, the only chronicler\r\ncapable of dealing with the situation in the right spirit is our old\r\nand valued friend, Mr. Punch. Personally, from the Saturday afternoon\r\nuntil the early hours on Monday, I saw scarcely one incident worthy of\r\nbeing treated seriously; nor did the accounts supplied to me by others\r\ntend to modify my impressions.\r\n\r\nThough the defeat at Sedan was virtually complete on Thursday the 1st at\r\nnine p.m., not the faintest rumour of it reached Paris before Friday\r\nevening at an advanced hour, and the real truth was not known generally\r\nuntil the Saturday at the hour just named. There was grief and\r\nconsternation on many faces, but no expression of fury or anger. That\r\nsentiment, at any rate in its outward manifestations, had to be supplied\r\nfrom the heights of Belleville and Montmartre, Montrouge and\r\nMontparnasse, when, later on, a good many of the inhabitants of those\r\ndelightful regions came down like an avalanche on the heart of the city.\r\nThey were the lambs of Blanqui, Delescluze, Félix Pyat, and Millière.\r\nThey were dispersed on reaching the Boulevard Montmartre, and we saw\r\nnothing of them from where we were seated, at the Café de la Paix. By\r\nthe time they rallied in the side streets and had marched to the\r\nPalais-Bourbon, they found their competitors, Favre, Gambetta, & Co.,\r\ntrying to oust the ministers of the Empire. But for that unfortunate\r\ndelay we might have had the Commune on the 4th of September instead of\r\non the 18th of March following. Blanqui, Pyat, & Co. never forgave\r\nFavre, Gambetta, & Co. for having forestalled them, and, above all, for\r\nnot having shared the proceeds of the spoil. This is so true that, even\r\nafter many years of lording it, the successors of, and co-founders with,\r\nthe firm of Favre, Gambetta, & Co. have been obliged, not only to grant\r\nan amnesty to those whom they cheated at the beginning, but to admit\r\nthem to some of the benefits of the undertaking; Méline, Tirard, Ranc,\r\nAlphonse Humbert, Camille Barrère, and a hundred others more or less\r\nimplicated in the Commune, are all occupying fat posts at the hour I\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\nA friend of ours, whose impartiality was beyond suspicion, and who had\r\nmore strength and inclination to battle with crowds than any of us,\r\noffered to go and see how the land lay at the Palais-Bourbon. He\r\nreturned in about an hour, and told us that Gambetta, perched on a\r\nchair, had been addressing the crowd from behind the railings, exhorting\r\nthem to patience and moderation. \"Clever trick that,\" said our\r\ninformant; \"it's the confidence-trick of housebreakers when two separate\r\ngangs have designs upon the same 'crib;' while the first arrivals\r\n'crack' it, they send one endowed with the 'gift of the gab' to pacify\r\nthe others.\"\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain--Gambetta and his crew did not want to pursue the\r\nwar, they wanted a Constituent Assembly which would have left them to\r\nenjoy in peace the fruits of their usurpation; for theirs was as much\r\nusurpation as was the Coup d'État. Their subsequent \"Not an inch of our\r\nterritory, not a stone of our fortresses,\" was an afterthought, when\r\nthey found that Bismarck would not grant them as good a peace as he\r\nwould have granted Napoléon at Donchery the morning after Sedan.\r\n\r\nAt about ten on Saturday night everybody knew that there would be a\r\nnight sitting, and I doubt whether one-fourth of the adult male\r\npopulation of Paris went to bed at all, even if they retired to their\r\nown homes.\r\n\r\nOur friend returned to the Palais-Bourbon, but failed to get a\r\ntrustworthy account of what had happened during the twenty-five minutes\r\nthe deputies had been assembled. All he knew was that nominally the\r\nEmpire was still standing, though virtually it had ceased to exist; a\r\nbill for its deposition having been laid on the table. On his way back\r\nto the Boulevards he saw the carriage of Thiers surrounded, and an\r\nattempt to take out the horses. He called Thiers \"le recéleur des vols\r\ncommis au préjudice des monarchies.\"[80]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 80: \"The receiver of the goods stolen from\r\n         monarchies.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nLet me look for a moment at that second-rate Talleyrand, who has been\r\ngrandiloquently termed the \"liberator of the soil\" because he happened\r\nto do what any intelligent bank manager could have done as well; let me\r\nendeavour to establish his share in the 4th of September. I am speaking\r\non the authority of men who were behind the political scenes for many\r\nyears, and whose contempt for nearly all the actors was equally great.\r\nThiers refused his aid and counsel to the Empress, who solicited it\r\nthrough the intermediary of Prince Metternich and M. Prosper Mérimée,\r\nbut he also refused to accept the power offered to him by Gambetta,\r\nFavre, Jules Simon, etc., in the afternoon of the 4th of September.\r\nNevertheless, he was here, there, and everywhere; offering advice, but\r\ncareful not to take any responsibility. Afterwards he took a journey to\r\nthe various courts of Europe. I only know the particulars of one\r\ninterview--that with Lord Granville--but I can vouch for their truth.\r\nAfter having held forth for two hours without giving his lordship a\r\nchance of edging in a word sideways, he stopped; and five minutes later,\r\nwhile Lord Granville was enumerating the reasons why the cabinet of St.\r\nJames's could not interfere, he (Thiers) was fast asleep. When the\r\nconditions of peace were being discussed, Thiers was in favour of giving\r\nup Belfort rather than pay another milliard of francs. \"A city you may\r\nrecover, a milliard of francs you never get back,\" he said.\r\nNevertheless, historians will tell one that Thiers made superhuman\r\nefforts to save Belfort. I did not like M. Thiers, and, being conscious\r\nof my dislike, I have throughout these notes endeavoured to say as\r\nlittle as possible of him.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose radiantly over Paris on the 4th of September, and I was up\r\nbetimes, though I had not gone to bed until 3 a.m. There was a dense\r\ncrowd all along the Rue Royale and the Place de la Concorde, and several\r\nhours before the Chamber had begun to discuss the deposition of the\r\nBonapartes (which was never formally voted), volunteer-workmen were\r\ndestroying or hauling down the Imperial eagles. The mob cheered them\r\nvociferously, and when one of these workmen hurt himself severely, they\r\ncarried him away in triumph. Nevertheless, there was a good deal of\r\nhooting as several well-known members of the Chamber elbowed their way\r\nthrough the serried masses. Though they were well known, I argued myself\r\nunknown in not knowing them. I was under the impression that they were\r\nImperialists; they turned out to be Republicans. The marks of\r\ndisapproval proceeded from compact groups of what were apparently\r\nworkmen. As I knew that no workmen devoted to the Empire would have\r\ndared to gather in that way, even if their numbers had been sufficient,\r\nand as I felt reluctant to inquire, I came to the natural conclusion\r\nthat the hooters were the supporters of Blanqui, Pyat, & Co. The Commune\r\nwas foreshadowed on the Place de la Concorde on that day.\r\n\r\nMy experience of the 24th of February, 1848, told me that the Chamber\r\nwould be invaded before long. In 1848 there was no more danger for a\r\nforeigner to mix with the rabble than for a Frenchman. I felt not quite\r\nso sure about my safety on the 4th of September. My adventure in the\r\nAvenue de Clichy, which I will relate anon, had not happened then, and\r\nI was not as careful as I became afterwards, still I remembered in time\r\nthe advice of the prudent Frenchman--\"When in doubt, abstain;\" and I\r\nprepared to retrace my steps to the Boulevards, where, I knew, there\r\nwould be no mistake about my identity. At the same time, I am bound to\r\nsay that no such accident as I dreaded, occurred during that day, as far\r\nas I am aware. There may or may not have been at that hour half a\r\nhundred spies of Bismarck in the city, but no one was molested. The\r\nParisians were so evidently overjoyed at getting rid of the Empire, that\r\nfor four and twenty hours, at any rate, they forgot all about the hated\r\nGermans and their march upon the capital. They were shaking hands with,\r\nand congratulating one another, as if some great piece of good fortune\r\nhad befallen them. Years before that, I had seen my wife behave in a\r\nsimilarly joyous manner after having dismissed at a moment's notice a\r\ncook who had shamefully robbed us: the wife knew very well that, on the\r\nmorrow, the tradesmen, the amount of whose bills the dishonest servant\r\nhad pocketed for months, would be sending in their claims upon us.\r\n\"Perhaps they will take into consideration that we dismissed her,\" she\r\nsaid, \"and not hold us responsible.\" The Latin race, and especially the\r\nFrench, are the females of the human race.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the gates of the Tuileries gardens on the Place de la\r\nConcorde were still open, and that the gardens themselves were black\r\nwith people. It must have been about half-past ten or eleven. I did not\r\ngo back by the Rue Royale, but by the Rue de Rivoli. The people were\r\nabsolutely streaming down the street. There was not a single threatening\r\ngesture on their part; they merely looked at the flag still floating\r\nover the Tuileries, and passed on. When I got back to the Boulevards, I\r\nsat down outside the Café de la Paix determined not to stir if possible.\r\nI knew that whatever happened the news of it would soon be brought\r\nthither. I was not mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe first news we had was that the National Guards had replaced the\r\nregulars inside and around the Palais-Bourbon, which was either a sign\r\nthat the latter could be no longer depended upon, or that the\r\nRepublicans in the Chamber had carried that measure in their own\r\ninterest. I am bound to admit that I would always sooner take the word\r\nof a French officer than that of a deputy, of no matter what shade; and\r\nI heard afterwards that the troops at the Napoléon barracks and\r\nelsewhere had begun to fraternize with the people as early as eight in\r\nthe morning, by shouting, from the windows of their rooms, \"Vive la\r\nRépublique!\" The Chamber was invaded, nevertheless; it is as well to\r\nstate that this invasion gave Jules Favre & Co. a chance of repairing in\r\nhot haste to the Hôtel de Ville, where the Government of the National\r\nDefence was proclaimed.\r\n\r\nTo return to my vantage-post at the Café de la Paix. The crowds on the\r\nPlace de la Concorde, apparently stationed there since early morning,\r\ndid not seem to me to have been brought thither at the instance of a\r\nleader or in obedience to a watchword. I except, of course, the groups\r\nof which I have already spoken, and which jeered at the republican\r\ndeputies. The streams of people I met on my return in the Rue de Rivoli\r\nseemed impelled by their own curiosity to the Chamber of Deputies. Not\r\nso the procession which hove in sight almost the moment I had sat down\r\nat the Café. It wheeled to the left when reaching the Rue de la Paix. It\r\nwas composed of National Guards with and without their muskets, each\r\ncompany preceded by its own officers,--the armed ones infinitely more\r\nnumerous than the unarmed, but all marching in good order and in utter\r\nsilence; in fact, so silently as to bode mischief. Behind and before\r\nthere strode large contingents of ordinary citizens, and I noticed two\r\nthings: that few of them wore blouses, and that a good many wore kepis,\r\napparently quite new. The wearers, though equally undemonstrative, gave\r\none the impression of being the leaders. Most of those around me shook\r\ntheir heads ominously as they passed; their silence did not impose upon\r\nthem. I am free to confess that I did not share their opinion. To me,\r\nthe whole looked like stern determined manifestors; not like turbulent\r\nrevolutionaries. I had seen nothing like them in '48. Nevertheless, it\r\nwas I who was mistaken, for, according to M. Sampierro Gavini, who,\r\nunlike his brother Denis, belonged to the opposition during the Empire,\r\nit was they who invaded the Chamber. I may add that M. Sampierro Gavini,\r\nthough in the opposition, had little or no sympathy with those who\r\noverthrew the Empire or established the Commune. He had an almost\r\nidealistic faith in constitutional means, and a somewhat exaggerated\r\nreverence for the name of Bonaparte. He was a Corsican.\r\n\r\nFor several hours nothing occurred worthy of record. The accounts\r\nbrought to us by eye-witnesses of events going on simultaneously at the\r\nTuileries and the Palais-Bourbon showed plainly that there was no\r\nintention on the mob's part to exalt the Empress into a\r\nMarie-Antoinette. Our friend who had given us the news of the Chamber on\r\nthe previous night, and who was a relative of the celebrated Dr. Yvan,\r\nan habitué of the Café de la Paix, had made up his mind in the morning\r\nthat \"it would be more interesting to watch the\" last heroic struggles\r\nof an Empress against iron fortune than the \"crownless coronation of a\r\nhalf-score of 'rois Pétauds.'\"[81] As such, he had taken up his station\r\nin the gardens of the Tuileries, close to the gate dividing the private\r\nfrom the public gardens. It was he who gave us the particulars of the\r\nscenes preceding and succeeding the Empress's flight, the exact moment\r\nof which no one seemed to know. The account of these scenes was so\r\nexceedingly graphic, that I have no difficulty whatsoever in remembering\r\nthem. Moreover, I put down at the time several of his own expressions. I\r\ndo not know what has become of him. He went to New-Zealand on account of\r\nsome unhappy love-affair, and was never heard of any more. Though\r\nscarcely thirty then, he was a promising young doctor. His name was\r\nRamail, but I do not know in what relation he stood to Dr. Yvan; who,\r\nhowever, always called him cousin.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 81: In olden times, every community, corporation, and\r\n         guild in France elected annually a king;--even the mendicants,\r\n         whose ruler took the title of King Pétaud, from the Latin\r\n         _peto_, I ask. The latter's court, as a matter of course, was a\r\n         perfect bear-garden, in which every one did as he liked, in\r\n         which every one was as much sovereign as the titular one. The\r\n         expression, \"the Court of King Pétaud,\" became a synonym for\r\n         everything that was disorderly, ridiculous, and disgusting.\r\n\r\n            \"Oui, je sors de chez vous fort mal édifiée;\r\n             Dans toutes mes leçons j'y suis contrariée;\r\n             On n'y respecte rien, chacun y parle haut,\r\n             Et c'est tout justement la cour du roi Pétaud.\"\r\n\r\n                     (MOLIÈRE, \"Tartuffe,\" Act i. Sc. 1.)--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nYoung Ramail had been in the Tuileries gardens since noon. The crowd was\r\nalready very large at that hour, but it seemed altogether engrossed in\r\nthe doings of an individual who was knocking down a gilded eagle on the\r\ntop of the gate. \"Mind,\" said Ramail, \"that was at twelve o'clock, or\r\nsomewhere thereabouts; and I do not think that the sitting at the\r\nChamber began until at least an hour later. If the Republicans say, in\r\ndays to come, that the Empire was virtually condemned before they voted\r\nits overthrow, they will, at any rate, have the semblance of truth on\r\ntheir side, because there were at least two thousand persons looking on\r\nwithout trying to prevent the destruction of the eagles by word or deed;\r\nand two thousand persons, if they happen to agree with them, are to the\r\nRepublicans the whole of France; while two millions, if they happen to\r\ndiffer from them, are only a corrupt and unintelligent majority.\r\n\r\n\"But I was wondering,\" he went on, \"at the utter ingratitude of the\r\nlower and lower-middle classes. I feel certain that among those who\r\nstood staring there, half owned their prosperous condition to the\r\neighteen years of Imperialism; yet I heard not a single expression of\r\nregret at the brutal sweeping away of it.\r\n\r\n\"I may have stood there for about an hour, a score of steps away from\r\nthe gate before the swing bridge, when, all at once, I felt myself\r\ncarried forward with the crowd; and before I had time to look round, I\r\nfound myself inside that other gate. There were about five hundred\r\npersons who had entered with me, but in what manner the gate gave way or\r\nwas opened I have not the vaguest idea. We went no further; we stopped\r\nas suddenly as we had advanced. I turned round with difficulty, and\r\nlooked over the heads of those behind me; sure enough, the gates were\r\nwide open and the crowd at the rear was much denser than it had been ten\r\nminutes before. Still they stood perfectly still, without bringing any\r\npressure to bear upon us. Then I turned round again, and saw the cause\r\nof their reluctance to move. The Imperial Guard was being massed in\r\nfront of the principal door leading from the private gardens into the\r\npalace. 'My dear Ramail,' I said to myself, 'you stand a very good\r\nchance of having a bullet through your head before you are ten minutes\r\nolder; because, at the slightest move of the crowd among which you now\r\nstand, the guard will fire.' I own that I was scarcely prepared to face\r\ndeath for such a trivial cause as this; and I was quietly edging my way\r\nout of the crowd, which was beginning to utter low ominous growls, when\r\na voice, ringing clear upon the air, shouted, 'Citoyens!' I stopped,\r\nturned round once more, and stood on tiptoe.\r\n\r\n\"The speaker was a tall, handsome fellow, young to all appearance, and\r\nwith a voice like a bell. He looked a gentleman, but I have never seen\r\nhim before to my knowledge. His companion I knew at once; it was\r\nVictorien Sardou. There is no mistaking that face. I have heard some\r\npeople say that it is not a bit like that of the great Napoléon, while\r\nothers maintain that, placing the living man and the portrait of the\r\ndead one side by side, one could not tell the difference. I'll undertake\r\nto say this, that if M. Sardou had donned a uniform, such as the\r\nlieutenant of artillery wore at Arcola, for instance, he might have\r\ntaken the Empress by the hand and led her out safely among the people,\r\nwho would have believed in some miraculous resurrection.\r\n\r\n\"To come back to my story. 'Citoyens,' repeated M. Sardou's companion,\r\n'I do not wonder at your surprise that the garden should not be open to\r\nyou and its ingress forbidden by soldiers. The Tuileries belong to the\r\npeople, now that the Empire is gone; for gone it is by this time, in\r\nspite of the Imperial Guard massed before yonder door. Consequently, my\r\nfriend and I propose to go and ask for the withdrawal of these soldiers.\r\nBut, in order to do this, you must give us your promise not to budge;\r\nfor the slightest attempt on your part to do so before our return may\r\nlead to bloodshed, and I am convinced that you are as anxious as we are\r\nto avoid such a calamity.'\r\n\r\n\"If that young fellow is not an actor, he ought to be. Every word he\r\nsaid could be heard distinctly and produced its effect. The crowd\r\ncheered him and promised unanimously to wait. Then we saw him and M.\r\nSardou take out their handkerchiefs and tie them to the end of their\r\nsticks. Perhaps it was well they did, for as I saw them boldly walk up\r\nthe central avenue, I was not at all convinced that their lives were not\r\nin danger. My sight is excellent, and I noticed a decidedly hostile\r\nmovement on the part of the troops ranged in front of the principal\r\ndoor, and an officer of Mobiles was evidently of my opinion, for, though\r\nhe followed them at a distance, he kept prudently behind the trees,\r\nsheltering himself as much as possible. I do not pretend to be wiser\r\nthan most of my fellow-men, but I doubt whether many among those who\r\nwatched M. Sardou and his companion suspected the true drift of their\r\nself-imposed mission. They merely wished to save the Tuileries from\r\nbeing pillaged and burnt down. I do not wish to libel the Imperial Guard\r\nor their officers, but I should feel much surprised if that noble idea\r\never entered their heads. What was the magnificent pile to them, now\r\nthat one of their idols had left it, probably for ever, and the other\r\nwas about to do the same? At any rate, the suspicious movement was\r\nthere. I have forgotten to tell you that the inner gate was closed and I\r\nsaw M. Sardou parley through its bars with one of the guardians. Then a\r\nsuperior officer, accompanied by a civilian, came out; but by this time,\r\nthe crowd, which had kept back, was beginning to move also, I among\r\nthem. All of a sudden, the general, who turned out to be General\r\nMellinet, gets on a chair, while his companion, who turns out to be M.\r\nde Lesseps, stands by him. The Imperial Guard disappears, seeing which,\r\nthe crowd, no longer apprehensive of being shot down, advances rapidly\r\nto within a few steps of the gate. Then there is a cheer, for the\r\nImperial flag is hauled down from the roof. 'Gentlemen,' says the\r\ngeneral, 'the Tuileries are empty, the Empress is gone. But it is my\r\nduty to guard the palace, and I count upon you to help me.' He says a\r\ngreat deal more, but the crowd are pressing forward all the same. I feel\r\nthat the crucial moment has arrived, and that the palace will be\r\ninvaded, in spite of the general's speechifying, when lo, the Gardes\r\nMobiles issue from the front door, and range themselves in two rows. The\r\ngates are opened, the crowd rushes in, but the Mobiles are there to\r\nprevent them making any excursions, either upstairs or into the\r\napartments, and in a few minutes we find ourselves in the Place du\r\nCarrousel. The palace has been virtually saved by M. Sardou.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, we receive the news that the Government of the\r\nNational Defence has been proclaimed at the Hôtel de Ville, and that\r\nnight Paris is illuminated as after a victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n     The siege -- The Parisians convinced that the Germans will not\r\n     invest Paris -- Paris becomes a vast drill-ground, nevertheless\r\n     -- The Parisians leave off singing, but listen to itinerant\r\n     performers, though the latter no longer sing the \"Marseillaise\"\r\n     -- The theatres closed -- The Comédie-Française and the Opéra --\r\n     Influx of the Gardes Mobiles -- The Parisian no longer chaffs the\r\n     provincial, but does the honours of the city to him -- The\r\n     stolid, gaunt Breton and the astute and cynical Normand -- The\r\n     gardens of the Tuileries an artillery park -- The mitrailleuse\r\n     still commands confidence -- The papers try to be comic -- Food\r\n     may fail, drink will not -- My visit to the wine dépôt at Bercy\r\n     -- An official's information -- Cattle in the public squares and\r\n     on the outer Boulevards -- Fear with regard to them -- Every man\r\n     carries a rifle -- The woods in the suburbs are set on fire --\r\n     The statue of Strasburg on the Place de la Concorde -- M.\r\n     Prudhomme to his sons -- The men who do not spout -- The French\r\n     shopkeeper and bourgeois -- A story of his greed -- He reveals\r\n     the whereabouts of the cable laid on the bed of the Seine --\r\n     Obscure heroes -- Would-be Ravaillacs and Balthazar Gerards --\r\n     Inventors of schemes for the instant annihilation of all the\r\n     Germans -- A musical mitrailleuse -- An exhibition and lecture at\r\n     the Alcazar -- The last train -- Trains converted into dwellings\r\n     for the suburban poor -- Interior of a railway station -- The spy\r\n     mania -- Where the Parisians ought to have looked for spies -- I\r\n     am arrested as a spy -- A chat with the officer in charge -- A\r\n     terrible-looking knife.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the frequent reports from the provinces that the Germans\r\nwere marching on Paris, there were thousands of people in the capital\r\nwho seriously maintained that they, the Germans, would not dare to\r\ninvest, let alone, shell it. But it must not be inferred, as many\r\nEnglish writers have done, that this confidence was due to a mistaken\r\nview of the Germans' pluck, or their reluctance to beard the \"lion\" in\r\nhis den. Not at all. The Parisians simply credited their foes with the\r\nsuperstitious love and reverence for \"the centre of light and\r\ncivilization\" which they themselves felt. They did not take their cue\r\nfrom Victor Hugo's \"highfalutin'\" remonstrance to King William; on the\r\ncontrary, it was the poet who translated their sentiments. It was not a\r\ncase of \"one fool making many;\" but of many mute inglorious visionaries\r\ninspiring a still greater one, who had the gift of eloquence, which\r\neloquence, in this instance, bordered very closely on sublimated drivel.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the whole of Paris became suddenly transformed into one\r\nvast drill-ground, and the clang of arms resounded through the city day\r\nand night. For the time being, the crowds left off singing, albeit that\r\nthey listened now and then devoutly and reverently to itinerant\r\nperformers, male and female, who had paraphrased the patriotic airs of\r\ncertain operas for the occasion. The \"Pars beau mousquetaire,\" etc., of\r\nHalévy, became \"Pars beau volontaire;\" the \"Guerre aux tyrans,\" of the\r\nsame composer, \"Guerre aux all'mands,\"[82] and so forth.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 82: The first from \"Les Mousquetaires de la Reine;\"\r\n         the second from \"Charles VI.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nAll the theatres had closed their doors by this time, the\r\nComédie-Française being last, I believe; though, almost immediately\r\nafterward, it threw open its portals once more for at least two\r\nperformances a week, and often a third time, in aid of the victims of\r\nthe siege. Meanwhile, several rooms were being got ready for the\r\nreception of the wounded; the new opera-house, still unfinished, was\r\nmade into a commissariat and partly into a barracks, for the provincial\r\nGardes Mobiles were flocking by thousands to the capital, and the camps\r\ncould not hold them all. For once in a way the Parisian forgot to chaff\r\nthe provincial who came to pay him a visit; and considering that, even\r\nunder such circumstances, all drill and no play would make Jacques a\r\ndull boy, he not only received him very cordially, but showed him some\r\nof the lions of the capital, at which the long-haired gaunt and stolid\r\nBreton stared without moving a muscle, only muttering an unintelligible\r\ngibberish, which might be an invocation to his ancient pagan gods, or a\r\ntribute of admiration; while the more astute and cynical, though\r\nscarcely more impressionable Normand, ten thousand of which had come\r\nfrom the banks of the Marne, showed the thought underlying all his daily\r\nactions, in one sentence: \"C'est _ben_ beau, mais ça a coûté beaucoup\r\nd'argent; fallait mieux le garder en poche.\" Even at this supreme\r\nmoment, he remembered, with a kind of bitterness, that he had been made\r\nto pay for part of all this glorious architecture.\r\n\r\nThe Cirques Napoléon and de l'Impératrice--the Republic had not had time\r\nto change their names--had become a kind of left-luggage office for\r\nthese human cargoes, taken thither at their arrival, which happened\r\ngenerally during the night. In the morning they were transferred to\r\ntheir permanent encampments, and their military education was proceeded\r\nwith at once. I am afraid I am not competent to judge of the merits of\r\nthe method adopted, but I was by no means powerfully impressed with the\r\nknowledge displayed by the instructors.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of the Tuileries had been closed to the public, who had to\r\nbe satisfied with admiring the ordnance and long rows of horses parked\r\nthere from a distance. Did the latter lend enchantment to the view?\r\nApparently, for they were never tired of gazing with ecstasy on the\r\nmitrailleuses. The gunners in charge treated the foremost of the gazers\r\nnow and then to a lecture on artillery practice, through the railings of\r\nthe gates. In whatsoever else they had lost faith, those murderous\r\nengines of war evidently still commanded their confidence.\r\n\r\nThe frightful din that marked the first weeks of the war had ceased, but\r\nParis did by no means look crestfallen. The gas burned brightly still,\r\nthe cafés were full of people, the restaurants had all their tables\r\noccupied; for we were not \"invested\" yet, and the idea of scarcity, let\r\nalone of famine, though a much-discussed contingency, was not a staring,\r\nstubborn fact. \"It will never become one,\" said and thought many, \"and\r\nall that talk about doling out rations already is so much nonsense.\" The\r\npapers waxed positively comic on the subject. They also waxed comic over\r\nthe telegrams of the King of Prussia to his Consort; but they left off\r\nharping on that string, for very shame' sake.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain from the beginning of the siege--whatever else\r\nmight fail, there was enough wine and to spare to cheer the hearts of\r\nmen who professed to do and dare more than men. Though the best part of\r\nmy life had been spent in Paris, I had, curiously enough, never seen the\r\nwine and spirit dépôts at Bercy; in fact, I was profoundly ignorant of\r\nthat, as well as of other matters connected with the food-supply of\r\nParis. So I wrote to a member of the firm which had supplied me for many\r\nyears with wine and spirits, and he took me thither.\r\n\r\nI should think that the \"entrepôt-général,\" as it is called, occupied,\r\nat that time, not less than sixty acres of ground, which meant more than\r\ntreble that area as far as storage was concerned; for there was not only\r\nthe cellarage, but the buildings above ground, rising, in many\r\ninstances, to three and four stories. The entrepôt consisted, and\r\nconsists still, I believe, of three distinct parts: one for wines;\r\nanother for what the French call \"alcohols,\" and we \"spirits;\" a third,\r\nmuch smaller, for potable, or, rather, edible oils. The latter wing\r\ncontains the cellarage of the general administration of the hospitals.\r\nThe spirit-cellars were absolutely empty at the time of my visit; their\r\ncontents had been removed to a bomb and shell proof cellarage hard by.\r\n\r\nThough I had come to see, I felt very little wiser after leaving the\r\ncellars than before; for, truth to tell, I was absolutely bewildered. I\r\nhad no more idea of the quantity of wine stored there than a child. My\r\nguide laughed.\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon make the matter clear to you,\" he said, shaking hands with a\r\ngentleman who turned out to be one of the principal employés. \"This\r\ngentleman will tell you almost to a hectolitre the quantity of ordinary\r\nwine in store. You know pretty well the number of inhabitants of the\r\ncapital, and though it has considerably increased during the last few\r\ndays, and is not unlikely to decrease during the siege, if siege there\r\nbe, the influx does not amount to a hundred thousand. Now, monsieur,\r\nwill you tell this gentleman what you have in stock?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have got at the present moment 1,600,000 hectolitres of ordinary\r\nwine in our cellars. Ten days ago we had nearly one hundred thousand\r\nmore, but the wine-shops and others have laid in large provisions since\r\nthen. The more expensive wines I need not mention, because the quantity\r\nis very considerably less, and, moreover, they are not likely to be\r\nwanted; though, if they were wanted, they would keep us going for many,\r\nmany weeks. At a rough guess, the number of 'souls' within the\r\nfortifications is about 1,700,000, with the recent increase 1,800,000;\r\nconsequently, with what the 'liquoristes' have recently bought, one\r\nhundred litres for every man, woman, and child. I do not reckon the\r\ncontents of private cellars, nor those of the wine-merchants, apart from\r\ntheir recent purchases. Nor is ordinary wine much dearer than it was in\r\nyears of great plenty; it is, in fact, less by twenty-five francs or\r\nthirty francs than in the middle of the fifties. I am comparing prices\r\nfor quarter pipes, containing from two hundred and ten to two hundred\r\nand thirty litres. There is no fear of regrating here, nor the\r\nlikelihood of our having to drink water for some time.\"\r\n\r\nOn our homeward journey, we noticed bullocks, pigs, and sheep littered\r\ndown in some of the public squares and on the outer boulevards. The\r\nstunted grass in the former had already entirely disappeared, and it was\r\nevident that, with the utmost care, the cattle would deteriorate under\r\nthe existing circumstances; for fodder would probably be the first\r\ncommodity to fail; as it was, it had already risen to more than twice\r\nits former price. Moreover, the competent judges feared that, in the\r\nevent of a rainy autumn, the cattle penned in such small spaces would be\r\nmore subject to epidemic diseases, which would absolutely render them\r\nunfit for human food. In view of such a contingency, the learned members\r\nof the Académie des Sciences were beginning to put their heads together,\r\nbut the results of their deliberations were not known as yet.\r\n\r\nWe returned on foot as we had come; private carriages had entirely\r\ndisappeared, and though the omnibuses and cabs were plying as usual,\r\ntheir progress was seriously impeded by long lines of vans, heavily\r\nladen with neat deal boxes, evidently containing tinned provisions. Very\r\nfew female passengers in the public conveyances, and scarcely a man\r\nwithout a rifle. They were the future defenders of the capital, who had\r\nbeen to Vincennes, where the distribution of arms was going on from\r\nearly morn till late at night. In fact, the sight of a working-man not\r\nprovided with a rifle, a mattock, a spade, or a pickaxe was becoming a\r\nrarity, for a great many had been engaged to aid the engineers in\r\ndigging trenches, spiking the ground, etc.\r\n\r\nI did not, and do not, feel competent to judge of the utility of all\r\nthese means of defense; one of them, however, seemed to be conceived in\r\nthe wrong spirit: I allude to the firing of the woods around Paris. With\r\nthe results of Forbach and Woerth to guide them, the generals entrusted\r\nwith the defence of Paris could not leave the woods to stand; but was\r\nthere any necessity to destroy them in the way they did? In spite of the\r\nactivity displayed, there were still thousands of idle hands anxious to\r\nbe employed. Why were not the trees cut down and transported to Paris,\r\nfor fuel for the coming winter? At that moment there were lots of horses\r\navailable, and such a measure would have given us the double advantage\r\nof saving coals for the manufacture of gas, and of protecting from the\r\nrigours of the coming winter hundreds whose sufferings would have been\r\nmitigated by light and heat. Personally, I did not suffer much. From\r\nwhat I have seen during the siege, I have come to the conclusion that\r\nshortcomings in the way of food are far less hard to bear, nay, are\r\nalmost cheerfully borne, in a warm room and with a lamp brightly\r\nburning. I leave out of the question the quantities of mineral oil\r\nwasted in the attempt to set fire to the woods, because in many\r\ninstances the attempt failed utterly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, patriotism was kept at the boiling point, by glowing reports\r\nof the heroic defence of General Uhrich at Strasburg. The statue,\r\nrepresenting the capital of Alsace on the Place de la Concorde, became\r\nthe goal of a reverent pilgrimage on the part of the Parisians, though\r\nthe effect of it was spoiled too frequently by M. Prudhomme holding\r\nforth sententiously, to his sons apparently, to the crowd in reality.\r\nThese discourses reminded one too much of Heine's sneer, that \"all\r\nFrenchmen are actors, and the worse are generally on the stage.\" In this\r\ninstance, however, the amateurs ran the professional very hard. The\r\ncrowds were not hypercritical, though, and they applauded the speaker,\r\nwho departed, accompanied by his offspring, with the proud consciousness\r\nthat he was a born orator, and that he had done his duty to his country\r\nby spouting platitudes. It is not difficult to give the general sequel\r\nto that amateur performance. Next morning there is a line in some\r\nobscure paper, and M. Prudhomme, beside himself with joy, leaves his\r\ncard on the journalist who wrote it; the journalist leaves his in\r\nreturn, and for the next six months the latter has his knife and fork\r\nlaid at M. Prudhomme's table. The acquaintance generally terminates on\r\nM. Prudhomme's discovery that Madame Prudhomme carried her friendship\r\ntoo far by looking after the domestic concerns of the scribe, at the\r\nscribe's bachelor quarters.\r\n\r\nThe men who did not spout were the Duruys, the Meissoniers, and a\r\nhundred others I could mention. The eminent historian and grand-master\r\nof the University, though sixty, donned the simple uniform of a National\r\nGuard, and performed his garrison duties like the humblest artisan, only\r\ndistinguished from the latter by his star of grand-officer of the Légion\r\nd'Honneur; the great painter did the same. The French shopkeeping\r\nbourgeois is, as a rule, a silly, pompous creature; very frequently, he\r\nis mean and contemptible besides.\r\n\r\nHere is a story for the truth of which I can vouch, and which shows him\r\nin his true light. In the skirmish in which Lieutenant Winslow was\r\nkilled, some damage had been done to the inn at Schirlenhoff, where the\r\nBaden officers were at breakfast when they were surprised by General de\r\nBernis and his men. The general had his foot already in the stirrup, and\r\nwas about to remove his prisoners, when Boniface made his appearance,\r\ncoolly asking to whom he was to present the bill for the breakage. The\r\ngeneral burst out laughing: \"The losing party pays the damage as a\r\nrule,\" he said, \"but France is sufficiently rich to reverse the rule.\r\nHere is double the amount of your bill.\"\r\n\r\nA second story, equally authentic. A cable had been secretly laid on the\r\nbed of the Seine between Paris and Havre, shortly before the siege. Two\r\nsmall shopkeepers of St. Germain revealed the fact for a consideration\r\nto the Germans, who had but very vague suspicions of it, and who\r\ncertainly did not know the land-bearings; one of the scoundrels was\r\ncaught after the siege, the other escaped. The one who was tried pleaded\r\npoverty, and received a ridiculously small sentence. It transpired\r\nafterwards that he was exceedingly well paid for his treachery, and that\r\nhe cheated his fellow-informer out of his share.\r\n\r\nThe contrast is more pleasant to dwell upon. There were hundreds of\r\nobscure heroes, by which I do not mean those prepared to shed their\r\nblood on the battle-field, but men with a sublime indifference to life,\r\ncourting the fate of a Ravaillac and a Balthazar Gerard. History would\r\nhave called them regicides, and perhaps ranked them with paid assassins\r\nhad they accomplished their purpose, would have held them up to the\r\nscorn of posterity as bloodthirsty fanatics,--and history, for once in a\r\nway, would have been wrong. In their reprehensible folly, they were more\r\nestimable than the Jules Favres, the Gambettas who played at being the\r\nsaviours of the country, and who were only the saviours of their needy,\r\nfellow political adventurers.\r\n\r\nApart from the former, there were the inventors of impossible schemes\r\nfor the instantaneous annihilation of the three hundred thousand Germans\r\naround Paris,--inventors who supply the comic note in the otherwise\r\nterrible drama,--inventors, who day by day besiege the Ministry for War,\r\nand to whom, after all, the minister's collaborateurs are compelled to\r\nlisten \"on the chance of there being something in their schemes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am asking myself, every now and then, whether I am a staff-officer or\r\none of the doctors at Charenton,\" said Prince Bibesca, one evening.\r\n\r\n\"Since yesterday morning,\" he went on, \"I have been interviewed by a\r\ndozen inventors, every one of whom wanted to see General Trochu or\r\nGeneral Schmitz, and would scarcely be persuaded that I would do as\r\nwell. The first one simply took the breath out of me. I had no energy\r\nleft to resist the others, or to bow them out politely; if they had\r\nchosen to keep on talking for four and twenty hours, I should have been\r\ncompelled to listen. He was a little man, about the height of M. Thiers.\r\nHis opening speech was in proportion to his height; it consisted of one\r\nline. 'Monsieur, I annihilate the Germans with one blow,' he said. I was\r\nthrown off my guard in spite of myself, for etiquette demands that I\r\nshould keep serious in spite of myself; and I replied, 'Let me fill my\r\npipe before you do it.'\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, my visitor spread out a large roll of paper on the table. 'I\r\nam not an inventor,' he said; 'I merely adapt the lessons of ancient\r\nhistory to the present circumstances. I merely modify the trick of the\r\nhorse of Troy. Here is Paris with its ninety-six bastions, its forts,\r\netc. I draw three lines: along the first I send twenty-five thousand men\r\npretending to attack the northern positions of the enemy; along the\r\nsecond line I send a similar number, apparently bent on a similar\r\nattempt to the south; my fifty thousand troops are perfectly visible to\r\nthe Germans, for they commence their march an hour or so before dusk.\r\nMeanwhile darkness sets in, and that is the moment I choose to despatch\r\na hundred and fifty thousand troops, screened and entirely concealed by\r\na movable wall of sheet iron, blackened by smoke. My inventive powers\r\nhave gone no further than this. My hundred and fifty thousand men behind\r\ntheir wall penetrate unhindered as far as the Prussian lines, where a\r\nhundred thousand fall on their backs, taking aim over the wall, while\r\nfifty thousand keep moving it forward slowly. Twelve shots for every man\r\nmake twelve hundred thousand shots--more than sufficient to cause a\r\npanic among the Germans, who do not know whence the firing proceeds,\r\nbecause my wall is as dark as night itself. Supposing, however, that\r\nthose who have been left in the camp defend themselves, their\r\nprojectiles will glance off against the sheet iron of the wall, which,\r\nif necessary, can be thrown down finally by our own men, who will finish\r\ntheir business with the bayonet and the sword.'\r\n\r\n\"My second visitor had something not less formidable to propose;\r\nnamely, a sledge-hammer, fifteen miles in circumference, and weighing\r\nten millions of tons. It was to be lifted up to a certain altitude by\r\nmeans of balloons. A favourable wind had to be waited for, which would\r\nsend the balloons in the direction of Versailles, where the ropes\r\nconfining the hammer would be cut. In its fall it would crush and bury\r\nthe head-quarters and the bulk of the German army.\r\n\r\n\"The third showed me the plan of a musical mitrailleuse, which would\r\ndeal death and destruction while playing Wagner, Schubert, and\r\nMendelssohn, the former by preference. 'The Germans,' he remarked, 'are\r\ntoo fond of music to be able to resist the temptation of listening. They\r\nare sure to draw near in thousands when my mitrailleuses are set\r\nplaying. We have got them at our mercy.' I asked him to send me a small\r\none as a sample: he promised to do so.\"\r\n\r\nAnother evening I was induced to go to the Alcazar. I had been there\r\nonce before, to hear Thérèsa. This time it was to see an \"Exhibition of\r\nEngines of War,\" and to listen to a practical lecture thereon. The\r\naudience was as jolly as if the Germans were a thousand miles\r\naway--jollier, perhaps, than when they listened to \"Rien n'est sacré\r\npour un sapeur;\" because they were virtually taking part in the\r\nperformance. The lecturer began by an exhibition of bullet-proof pads,\r\nby means of which the soldier might fearlessly advance towards the\r\nenemy; \"because they render that part of the body on which they are worn\r\ninvulnerable.\" A wag among the spectators made a remark about\r\n\"retreating soldiers,\" which I cannot transcribe; but the exhibitor, an\r\nItalian or Spanish major, to judge by his accent, was in no way\r\ndisconcerted. He placed his pad against an upright board in the shape of\r\na target and began firing at it with a revolver at a distance of four or\r\nfive paces. The material, though singed, was not pierced, but the\r\nspectators seemed by no means convinced. \"You wear the pad, and let me\r\nhave a shot at you,\" exclaimed one; at which offer the major made a long\r\nface. \"Have you ever tried the experiment on a living animal?\" asks\r\nanother. \"Perfectly,\" replied the major; \"I tried it on my clerk,\" which\r\nadmission was hailed with shouts of laughter. There were cries for the\r\nclerk, who did not appear. A corporal of the National Guards proposed to\r\ntry an experiment on the major and the pad with the bayonet fastened to\r\na chassepot; thereupon major and pad suddenly disappeared behind the\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe next inventor exhibits a fire-extinguisher; the audience require\r\nmore than a verbal explanation; some of them propose to set the Alcazar\r\non fire. A small panic, checked in time; and the various demonstrations\r\nare proceeded with amidst shouts, and laughter, and jokes. They yield no\r\npractical results, but they kill time. They are voted the next best\r\nthing to the theatre.\r\n\r\nBy this time we were shut off from the outer world. On the 17th of\r\nSeptember, at night, the last train of the Orléans Railway Company had\r\nleft Paris. The others had ceased working a day or so before, and placed\r\ntheir rolling stock in safety. Not the whole of it, though. A great many\r\nof the third-class carriages have had their seats taken out, the luggage\r\nand goods vans have been washed, the cattle trucks boarded in, and all\r\nthese transformed into temporary dwellings for the suburban poor who\r\nhave been obliged to seek shelter within the walls of the capital. The\r\ninteriors of the principal railway stations present scenes that would\r\nrejoice the hearts of genre-painters on a large scale. The washing and\r\ncooking of all these squatters is done on the various platforms, the\r\ncarriages have become parlor and bedroom in one, and there has even been\r\nsome ingenuity displayed in their decoration. The womankind rarely stir\r\nfrom their improvised homes; the men are on the fortifications or\r\nroaming the streets of Paris. Part of the household gods has been stowed\r\ninside the trucks, the rest is piled up in front. The domestic pets,\r\nsuch as cats and dogs, have, as yet, not been killed for food, and the\r\nformer have a particularly good time of it, for mice and rats abound,\r\nespecially in the goods-sheds. Here and there a goat gravely stalking\r\nalong, happily unconscious of its impending doom; and chanticleer\r\nsurrounded by a small harem trying to make the best of things.\r\n\r\nOf course, the sudden and enormous influx of human beings could not be\r\nhoused altogether in that way, but care has been taken that none of them\r\nshall be shelterless. All the tenantless apartments, from the most\r\npalatial in the Faubourg St. Honoré and Champs-Élysées to the humblest\r\nin the popular quarters, have been utilized, and the pot-au-feu simmers\r\nin marble fireplaces, while Gallic Hodge sees his face reflected in\r\ngigantic mirrors the like of which he never saw before. The dwellings\r\nthat have been merely vacated by their tenants who have flitted to\r\nHomburg and Baden-Baden, to Nice and elsewhere, are as yet not called\r\ninto requisition by the authorities.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment we were cut off from the outer world, the spy mania,\r\nwhich had been raging fiercely enough before, became positively\r\ncontagious. There is not the slightest doubt that there were spies in\r\nParis, but I feel perfectly certain that they were not prowling about\r\nthe streets, and that to have caught them one would have had to look\r\namong the personnel of the ministries. For a foreigner, unless he spoke\r\nFrench without the slightest accent, to have accepted such a mission,\r\nwould have been akin to madness; and there were and are still few\r\nforeigners, however well they may know French, who do not betray their\r\norigin now and then by imperfect pronunciation. Besides, there was\r\nnothing to spy in the streets; nevertheless, the spy mania, as I have\r\nalready said, had reached an acute crisis. The majority of the National\r\nGuard seemed to have no other occupation than to look for spies. A poor\r\nSpanish priest was arrested because he had been three times in the same\r\nafternoon to the cobbler for the only serviceable pair of shoes he\r\npossessed. Woe to the man or woman who was ill-advised enough to take\r\nout his pocket-book in the streets. If you happened to be of studious\r\nhabits, or merely inclined to sit up late, the lights peeping through\r\nthe carelessly drawn curtains exposed you to a sudden visit from half a\r\ndozen ill-mannered, swaggering National Guards, your concierge was\r\ncalled out of his bed, while you were taken to the nearest commissary of\r\npolice to explain; or, what was worse still, to the nearest military\r\npost, where the lieutenant in command made it a point to be altogether\r\nsoldier-like--according to his ideas, _i. e._ brutal, rude, disgustingly\r\nfamiliar. You might get an apology from the police-official for having\r\nbeen disturbed and dragged through the streets for no earthly reason;\r\nthe quasi-military man would have considered it beneath his dignity to\r\noffer one.\r\n\r\nOf course, every now and then, one happened to meet with a gentleman who\r\nwas only too anxious to atone for the imbecile \"goings-on\" of his men,\r\nand I was fortunate enough to do so one night. It was on the 20th of\r\nSeptember, when the feelings of the Parisians had already been\r\nembittered by their first and not very creditable defeat under their own\r\nwalls. I do not suppose there were more than a score of Englishmen in\r\nParis, besides the Irishmen engaged in salting beef at the\r\nslaughter-house of La Villette, when, but for that gentleman, I should\r\nhave been in a sore strait. Among the English, there was a groom who, at\r\nthe time of the general exodus, was so dangerously ill that the doctor\r\nabsolutely forbade his removal, even to a hospital. The case had been\r\nbrought under my notice, and as the poor fellow was very respectable and\r\nhad been hard-working, as he had a wife and a young family besides, we\r\nnot only did all we could for him, but I went to see him personally two\r\nor three times to cheer him up a bit. He was on the mend, but slowly,\r\nvery slowly. He lived in one of the side streets of the Avenue de\r\nClichy, and had lived there a good while, and the concierge of the house\r\nhad her mind perfectly at rest with regard to his nationality, albeit\r\nthat the fact of being an Englishman was not always a sufficient\r\nguarantee against the suspicion of being a spy on the part of the lower\r\nclasses. Moreover, they would not always take the fact for granted; they\r\nwere unable to distinguish an English from a German or any other accent,\r\nand, with them, to be a foreigner was necessarily to be a German, and a\r\nGerman could not be anything but a spy. However, in this instance, I\r\nfelt no anxiety for my protégé.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a few days before the closing of Paris, the concierge\r\nherself fell ill, and another one took her place. The successor was a\r\nman, and not by any means a pleasant man. There was a scowl on his face,\r\nas, in answer to his summons, I told him whither I was going; and he\r\ncast a suspicious look at a box I was carrying under my arm, which\r\nhappened to contain nothing more formidable than a surgical appliance. I\r\ntook no notice, however, and mounted the stairs.\r\n\r\nMy visit may have lasted between twenty minutes and half an hour. When I\r\ncame out, a considerable crowd had assembled on the footway and in the\r\nroad, and a dozen National Guards were ranged in a semicircle in front\r\nof the door.\r\n\r\nThe first cry that greeted me was \"Le voilà,\" and then a corporal\r\nadvanced. \"Your name, citizen,\" he said, in a hectoring tone, \"and what\r\nbrings you to this house?\" I kept very cool, and told him that I would\r\nneither give him my name nor an explanation of my visit, but that if he\r\nwould take me to his lieutenant or captain, I should be pleased to give\r\nboth to the latter. But he would not be satisfied. \"Where is the box you\r\nhad in your hand? what did it contain? and what have you done with it?\"\r\nhe insisted. I knew that it would be useless to try and enlighten him,\r\nso I stuck to my text. Meanwhile the crowd had become very excited, so I\r\nsimply repeated my request to be taken to the post.\r\n\r\nThe crowd would have willingly judged me there and then; that is, strung\r\nme up to the nearest lamp-post. If they had, not a single one among them\r\nwould have been prosecuted for murder, and by the end of the siege the\r\nBritish Government would have considered it too late to move in the\r\nmatter; besides, a great many of my countrymen would have opined that\r\n\"it served me right\" for remaining in Paris, when I might have made\r\nmyself so comfortable in London or elsewhere. So I felt very thankful\r\nwhen the corporal, though very ungraciously, ordered his men to close\r\naround me and \"to march.\" I have, since then, been twice to the Avenue\r\nde Clichy on pleasure bent; that is, to breakfast at the celebrated\r\nestablishment of \"le père Lathuille,\" and the sight of the lamp-posts\r\nthere sent a cold shudder down my back.\r\n\r\nThe journey to the military post did not take long. It had been\r\nestablished in a former ball-room or music-hall, for at the far end of\r\nthe room there was a stage, representing, as far as I can remember, an\r\nantique palace. The floor of it was littered with straw, on which a\r\nscore or so of civic warriors were lazily stretched out; while others\r\nwere sitting at the small wooden tables, that had, not long ago, borne\r\nthe festive \"saladier de petit bleu.\" Some of the ladles with which that\r\ndecoction had been stirred were still hanging from the walls; for in\r\nthose neighbourhoods the love of portable property on the part of the\r\npatrons is quite Wemmickian, and the proprietors made and make it a rule\r\nto throw as little temptation as possible in the way of the former. The\r\nplace looked quite sombre, though the gas was alight. There was an\r\nintolerable smell of damp straw and stale tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\nPart of the crowd succeeded in making their way inside, notwithstanding\r\nthe efforts of the National Guards. My appearance caused a certain stir\r\namong the occupants of the room; but in a few moments the captain,\r\nsummoned from an apartment at the back, came upon the scene, and my\r\npreliminary trial was proceeded with at once.\r\n\r\nThe indictment of the corporal who had arrested me was brief and to the\r\npoint. \"This man is a foreigner who pays constant visits to another\r\nforeigner, supposed to be sick. This evening he arrived with a box under\r\nhis arm which he left with his friend. The concierge has reason to\r\nsuppose that there is something wrong, for he does not believe in the\r\nman's illness. He is supposed to be poor, and still he and his family\r\nare living on the fat of the land. My prisoner refused to give me his\r\nname and address, or an explanation of his visit.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you to say, monsieur?\" asked the captain, a man of about\r\nthirty-five, evidently belonging to the better classes. I found out\r\nafterwards that his name was Garnier or Garmier, and that he was a\r\ncashier in one of the large commercial establishments in the Rue St.\r\nMartin. He was killed in the last sortie of the Parisians.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time I had been addressed that evening as \"monsieur.\" I\r\nsimply took a card from my pocket-book and gave it to him. \"If that is\r\nnot sufficient, some of your men can accompany me home and ascertain for\r\nthemselves that I have not given a false name or address,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at it for a moment. \"It is quite unnecessary. I know your name\r\nvery well, though I have not the honour of knowing you personally. I\r\nhave seen your portrait at my relatives' establishment\"--he named a\r\ncelebrated picture-dealer in the Rue de la Paix,--\"and I ought to have\r\nrecognized you at once, for it is a very striking likeness, but it is so\r\ndark here.\" Then he turned to his men and to the crowd: \"I will answer\r\nfor this gentleman. I wish we had a thousand or so of foreign spies like\r\nhim in Paris. France has no better friend than he.\"\r\n\r\nI was almost as much afraid of the captain's praise as I had been of the\r\ncorporal's blame, because the crowd wanted to give me an ovation; seeing\r\nwhich, M. Garmier invited me to stay with him a little while, until the\r\nlatter should have dispersed. It was while sitting in his own room that\r\nhe told me the following story.\r\n\r\n\"My principal duty, monsieur, seems to consist, not in killing Germans,\r\nbut in preventing perfectly honest Frenchmen and foreigners from being\r\nkilled or maimed. Not later than the night before last, three men were\r\nbrought in. They were all very powerful fellows; there was no doubt\r\nabout their being Frenchmen. They did not take their arrest as a matter\r\nof course at all, but to every question I put they simply sent me to the\r\ndevil. It was not the behaviour of the presumed spy, who, as a rule, is\r\nvery soft spoken and conciliating until he sees that the game is up,\r\nwhen he becomes insulting. Still, I reflected that the violence of the\r\nthree men might be a clever bit of acting also, the more that I could\r\nsee for myself that they were abominably, though not speechlessly,\r\ndrunk. Their offence was that they had been seen loitering in a field\r\nvery close to the fortifications, with their noses almost to the ground.\r\nDo what I would, an explanation I could not get, and at last the most\r\npowerful of the trio made a movement as if to draw a knife. With great\r\ndifficulty a dozen of my men succeeded in getting his coat off; and\r\nthere, between his waistcoat and his shirt, was a murderously looking\r\nblade, a formidable weapon indeed.\r\n\r\n\"'He is a Prussian spy, sure enough!' exclaimed the roomful of guards.\r\n\r\n\"I examined the knife carefully, tried to find the name of the maker,\r\nand all at once put it to my nose. Then I took up a candle and looked\r\nmore carefully still at the prisoners. 'They are simply drunk,' I said,\r\n'and the best thing you can do is to take them home.'\r\n\r\n\"'But the knife?' insisted the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"'The knife is all right,' I answered.\r\n\r\n\"'I should think it is all right,' said the owner, 'seeing that I am\r\ncutting provisions all day with it for those confounded Parisians.'\r\n\r\n\"But the guards were not satisfied with the explanation. They began to\r\nsurround me. 'That was surely a sign you made to the fellow when you\r\nlifted the blade to your face, captain,' said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"'Not at all, friend; I was simply smelling it. And it smelt abominably\r\nof onions.' That will give you an idea, monsieur, of the life they lead\r\nme also. Still, I would ask you, as a particular favour, monsieur, not\r\nto mention your mishap to any one. As you are aware, I am not to blame;\r\nbut we are in bad odour enough as it is at the Ministry of War, and we\r\ndo not wish to increase our somewhat justified reputation for\r\nirresponsible rowdyism and lack of discipline.\"\r\n\r\nI gave him my promise to that effect, and have not mentioned the matter\r\nuntil this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n     The siege -- The food-supply of Paris -- How and what the\r\n     Parisians eat and drink -- Bread, meat, and wine -- Alcoholism --\r\n     The waste among the London poor -- The French take a lesson from\r\n     the alien -- The Irish at La Villette -- A whisper of the horses\r\n     being doomed -- M.

But, ignorant as I am in these\r\nmatters, and notwithstanding the repeated failures of General Trochu's\r\ntroops to break through the lines of investment, I feel certain, on the\r\nother hand, that the Germans would have never taken Paris by storming\r\nit. Years before, Von Moltke had expressed his opinion to that effect in\r\nhis correspondence, not exactly with regard to the French capital, but\r\nwith regard to any fortified centre of more than a hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants. Such an agglomeration, even if severely left alone, and\r\nonly shut off from the rest of the world, falls by itself. I am giving\r\nthe spirit and not the substance of his words.\r\n\r\nConsequently, there is no need to say, that, to the mere social\r\nobserver, the problems raised by the food-supply were perhaps the most\r\ninteresting. Even under normal conditions, the average Parisian in his\r\nmethod of feeding is worth studying; he is supposed to be one of the\r\nmost abstemious creatures on the civilized globe. And yet, I do not\r\nthink that he consumes less alcohol than the average Englishman or\r\nGerman. The Frenchman's alcohol is more diluted; that is all. A drunken\r\nwoman is a very rare sight, either in Paris or in the provinces;\r\nnevertheless, there is, probably, not one in a thousand women among the\r\nlower classes who drinks less than her half a bottle of wine per day;\r\nwhile ladies of high degree generally partake of one if not two glasses\r\nof chartreuse with their coffee, after each of the two principal meals.\r\n_Un grog Américain_ is as often ordered for the lady as for the\r\ngentleman, during the evening visits to the café. I am speaking of\r\ngentlewomen by birth and education, and of the spouses of the well-to-do\r\nmen, not of the members of the demi-monde and of those below them.\r\n\r\nSo far, the question of drink, which, after my visit to the wine-dépôts\r\nat Bercy, assumed an altogether different aspect to my mind. I began to\r\nwonder whether the plethora of wine would not do as much harm as the\r\nexpected scarcity of food. My fears were not groundless.\r\n\r\nFrenchmen, especially Parisians, not only eat a great quantity of bread,\r\nbut they are very particular as to its quality. I have a note showing\r\nthat, during the years 1868-69, the consumption per head for every man,\r\nwoman, and child amounted to a little more than an English pound per\r\nday, and that very little of this was of \"second quality,\" though the\r\nlatter was as good as that sold at many a London baker's as first. I\r\ntasted it myself, because the municipality had made a great point of\r\nintroducing it to the lower classes at twopence per quartern less than\r\nthe first quality. Nevertheless, the French workman would have none of\r\nit.[83]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 83: Goethe, in his journey through France, noticed\r\n         that the peasants who drove his carriage invariably refused to\r\n         eat the soldiers' bread, which he found to his taste.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nEven in the humblest restaurants, the bread supplied to customers is of\r\na superior quality; the ordinary household bread (pain de ménage) is\r\nonly to be had by specially asking for it; the roll with the\r\ncafé-au-lait in the morning is an institution except with the very poor.\r\n\r\nAs for meat, I have an idea, in spite of all the doubts thrown upon the\r\nquestion by English writers, that the Parisian workman in 1870 consumed\r\nas much as his London fellow. The fact of the former having two square\r\nmeals a day instead of one, is not sufficiently taken into account by\r\nthe casual observer. There are few English artisans whose supper, except\r\non Sundays, consists of anything more substantial than bread and cheese.\r\nThe Frenchman eats meat at twelve a.m. and at six p.m. The nourishment\r\ncontained in the scraps, the bones, etc., is generally lost to the\r\nEnglishman: not a particle of it is wasted in France. Be that as it may,\r\nthe statistics for 1858 show a consumption of close upon eight ounces\r\n(English) of fresh meat per day for every head of the population. Be it\r\nremembered that these statistics are absolutely correct, because a\r\ntown-due of over a halfpenny per English pound is paid on the meat\r\nleaving the public slaughter-houses, and killed meat is taxed similarly\r\nat the city gates. Private slaughter-houses there are virtually none.\r\n\r\nAllowing for all this, it will be seen that Paris was not much better\r\noff than other capitals would have been if threatened with a siege,\r\nexcept, perhaps, for the ingenuity of even the humblest French housewife\r\nin making much out of little by means of vegetables, fruit, and\r\ncunningly prepared sauces, for which, nevertheless, butter, milk, lard,\r\netc., were wanted, which commodities were as likely to fail as all other\r\nthings. Nor must one forget to mention the ingenuity displayed in the\r\npublic slaughter-houses themselves, in utilizing every possible scrap of\r\nthe slaughtered animals for human food. I had occasion, not very long\r\nago (1883), to go frequently, and for several weeks running, to one of\r\nthe poorest quarters in London. I often made the journey on foot, for I\r\nam ashamed to say that, until then, the East End was far more unknown to\r\nme than many an obscure town in France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. The\r\nclever remark of a French sociologist that \"the battle of life is fought\r\nbelow the belt,\" holds especially good with regard to the lower classes.\r\nWell, I may unhesitatingly say that in no country are the poor left in\r\ngreater ignorance with regard to cheap and nourishing food than in\r\nEngland, if I am to judge by London. The French, the German, the\r\nItalian, the Spanish poor, have a dozen inexpensive and succulent dishes\r\nof which the English poor know absolutely nothing; and still those very\r\ndishes figure on the tables of the well-to-do, and of fashionable\r\nrestaurants, as entrées under more or less fantastic names. Is the\r\nEnglish working man so utterly devoid of thrift and of common sense, is\r\nhis contempt for the foreigner so great as to make him refuse to take a\r\nlesson from the latter? I think not. I fancy it will depend much on the\r\nmanner in which the lesson is conveyed. A little less board-school work\r\nand Sunday-school teaching, fewer Bible classes, and a good many\r\npractical cooking-classes would probably meet the case.\r\n\r\nThe French, though aware of their incontestable superiority in the way\r\nof preparing food, did not disdain to take a lesson from the alien. They\r\nclearly foresaw the fate in store for the cattle penned in the squares\r\nand public gardens, if compelled to remain there under existing\r\nconditions, and with the inclement season close at hand; consequently,\r\nthe authorities enlisted the services of Mr. Wilson, an Irish gentleman\r\nwho had been residing in Paris for a number of years, and whose\r\nexperience in the salted-provision trade seemed to them very likely to\r\nyield most satisfactory results. Up till then, only thirty head of\r\ncattle had been submitted to his process, from that moment the number is\r\nconsiderably increased, and it becomes apparent that, in a short while,\r\nthere will be few live oxen, sheep, or pigs left in Paris, though, as\r\nyet we are only in the beginning of October. Under Mr. Wilson's able\r\nmanagement, half a hundred Irishmen are at work for many, many hours a\r\nday at the slaughter-house in La Villete, whither flock the Parisians,\r\nat any rate the privileged ones, to watch the preliminaries to the\r\nrégime of salt-junk which is staring them in the face. The fodder thus\r\neconomized will go to the horses, although there is a whisper in the air\r\nthat one eminent savant has recommended their immediate slaughter and\r\nsalting also. Of course, such as are wanted for military purposes will\r\nbe exempted from this holocaust on the altar of patriotism. M. Gagne,\r\nwho has already provided the Parisians with amusement for years, in his\r\ncapacity as a perpetual candidate for parliamentary honours, does not\r\nstop at hippophagy; he seriously proposes anthropophagy. \"A human being\r\nover sixty is neither useful nor ornamental,\" he exclaimed at a public\r\nmeeting; \"and to prove that I mean what I say, I am willing to give\r\nmyself as food to my sublime and suffering townsmen.\" Poor fellow! as\r\nmad as a March hare, but a man of education and with an infinite fund of\r\nsympathy for humanity. He was but moderately provided for at the best of\r\ntimes; his income was derived from some property in the provinces, and,\r\nas a matter of course, the investment of Paris stopped his supplies of\r\nfunds from that quarter. He was of no earthly use in the besieged city,\r\nbut he refused to go. He had a small but very valuable collection of\r\nfamily plate, which went bit by bit to the Mint, not to feed himself but\r\nto feed others, for he was never weary of well-doing. He reminded one\r\nirresistibly of Balzac's hero, \"le Père Goriot,\" parting with his\r\ntreasures to supply his ungrateful daughters, for the Parisians were\r\nungrateful to him. Mad as he was, no man in possession of all his mental\r\nfaculties could have been more sublime.\r\n\r\nWhatever the question of human flesh as food may have been to the\r\nParisians, that of horseflesh was by no means new to them. Since '66,\r\nvarious attempts had been made to introduce it on a large scale, but,\r\nfor once in a way, they were logical in their objections to it. \"It is\r\nall very well,\" wrote a paper, devoted to the improvement of the humbler\r\nclasses,--\"it is all very well for a few savants to sit round a\r\nwell-appointed table to feast upon the succulent parts of a young,\r\ntender, and perfectly healthy horse, especially if the steaks are 'aux\r\ntruffes,' and the kidneys stewed in 'Madeira;' but that young, tender,\r\nand perfectly healthy horse would cost more than an equally tender,\r\nyoung, and perfectly healthy bullock or cow. So, where is the advantage?\r\nIn order to obtain that advantage, horses only fit for the knacker's\r\nyard, not fit for human food, would have to be killed, and the\r\nhard-working artisan with his non-vitiated taste, who does not even care\r\nfor venison or game when it happens to be 'high,' would certainly not\r\ncare for a superannuated charger to be set before him. You might just as\r\nwell ask an unsophisticated cannibal to feast upon an invalid. The best\r\npart of 'the warrior on the shelf' is his wooden leg or his wooden arm;\r\nthe best part of the superannuated charger is his skin or his hoof, with\r\nor without the shoe; and no human being, whether cannibal or not, can be\r\nexpected to make a timber-yard, a tanner's yard, or an old-iron and rag\r\nstore of his stomach, even to please faddists.\"\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, only two millions of pounds of horseflesh were\r\n\"produced\" during the first three years succeeding the publication of\r\nthat article (1866-69); but it is more than doubtful whether a sixteenth\r\npart of it was consumed as human food--with a knowledge on the part of\r\nthe consumers. And during those three years, as if to prove the\r\nwriter's words, the public were being constantly fortified in their\r\ndislike with official reports of the seizure of diseased horses on their\r\nway to the four specially appointed slaughter-houses. I remember, that\r\nin one week, twenty-four animals were thus confiscated by the sanitary\r\ninspectors, \"the flesh of which,\" added the _Moniteur_, \"would have\r\nprobably found its way to the tables of the better class Parisians, in\r\nthe shape of Arles, Lorraine, or German sausages. These commodities,\" it\r\nwent on, \"are never offered by the manufacturer to the experienced\r\nproprietors of the ham and beef shops (charcutiers), but to fruiterers,\r\ngrocers, vendors of so-called dainties, and dealers in preserved\r\nprovisions.\" The article had the effect of arousing the suspicion of the\r\nbetter classes as well as of the poorer.\r\n\r\nThe number of \"horse-butchers\" had decreased by four during the four\r\nyears that had elapsed since their first establishment with the\r\nGovernment's sanction, and the remaining eighteen were not very\r\nprosperous when the siege brought the question to the fore once more.\r\nThe public could not afford to be positively hostile to the scheme, but\r\nthe assertion of the rare advocates of the system, that they were\r\nenthusiastic, is altogether beside the truth. They had to make the best\r\nof a bad game, that was all. It is a very curious, but positive fact,\r\nnevertheless, that I have heard Parisians speak favourably afterwards of\r\ndog's and cat's flesh, even of rats baked in a pie; I have heard them\r\nsay that, for once in a way, even under ordinary circumstances, they\r\nwould not mind partaking of those dishes: I have never heard them\r\nexpress the same good will toward horseflesh. Of course, I am alluding\r\nto those who affected no partisanship, either one way or the other. One\r\nthing is very certain, though: at the end of the siege the sight of a\r\ncat or dog was a rarity in Paris, while by the official reports there\r\nwere thirty thousand horses left.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Académie de Sciences is attracting notice by the reports\r\nof its sittings, in which the question of food is the only subject\r\ndiscussed. Professor Dorderone reads a paper on the utilization of beef\r\nand mutton fat; and he communicates a new process with regard to kidney\r\nfat, which, up till then, had withstood the attempts of the most\r\ncelebrated chefs for culinary purposes. He professes to have discovered\r\nthe means of doing away with the unpleasant taste and smell which have\r\nhitherto militated against its use, he undertakes to give it the\r\nflavour and aroma of the best butter from Brittany and Normandy. M.\r\nRichard, the maire of La Villette, attempts similar experiments with\r\nanimal offal, which M. Dumas, the great savant, declares highly\r\nsatisfactory. M. Riche, one of the superior officials of the Mint,\r\ntransforms bullock's blood into black puddings, which are voted superior\r\nto those hitherto made with pig's blood. The nourishing properties of\r\ngelatine are demonstrated in an equally scientific manner, and the\r\nAcadémie des Sciences gradually becomes the rendezvous of the fair ones\r\nof Paris, who come to take lessons in the culinary art.\r\n\r\n\"Mais, monsieur,\" says one, \"maintenant que nous avons du beurre,\r\nveuillez nous dire d'où viendront nos épinards?\"[84]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 84: \"Mettre du beurre dans ses épinards,\" means,\r\n         figuratively, to increase one's comforts.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"Don't let that trouble you, madame,\" is the answer; \"if you will honour\r\nus with your presence next week, one of our learned friends from the\r\nJardin des Plantes will tell you how to grow salads, and perhaps\r\nasparagus, on your balcony and in front of your windows, in less than a\r\nfortnight.\"\r\n\r\nThe learned professor is not trying to mystify his charming\r\ninterlocutor; he honestly believes in what he says: and, a week later,\r\nwhen \"the friend from the Jardin des Plantes\" has spoken, there is a\r\nwonderful run on all the seed-shops near the Châtelet, every one tries\r\nto borrow flower-pots from his neighbours, and barrow-loads of mould are\r\nbeing trundled in long lines into Paris. Wherever one goes, the eye\r\nmeets careful housewives bending over wooden boxes on the balconies; M.\r\nPhilippe Lockroy, the eminent actor and dramatist, the father of M.\r\nEdouard Lockroy, the future minister of the Third Republic, asks\r\nseriously why we should not revive the hanging gardens of Semiramis, and\r\nsets the example by converting his fifth floor balcony into a market\r\ngarden, to the discomfiture of his son, who finds his erstwhile bedroom\r\nconverted into a storehouse for tools and less agreeable matter. I may\r\nmention that M. Lockroy did not abandon his project after a mere\r\nfleeting attempt, nor when the necessity for it had disappeared, but\r\nthat at the hour I write (1883) he has taken a prize for pears grown on\r\nthat same balcony.\r\n\r\nThe mania spreads, and every one becomes, for the time being, a\r\nmarket-gardener in chambers. Even M. Pierre Joigneux, the well-known\r\nhorticulturist, and equally clever writer, is bitten with it. That the\r\nthing was perfectly feasible, was proved subsequently by M. Lockroy, but\r\nthe latter did not imitate the nigger who dug up the potatoes an hour\r\nafter he had planted them, to see if they were growing. That thoroughly\r\ninexperienced persons should have indulged in such wild fancies is\r\nperhaps not to be wondered at; but M. Joigneux was not one of these, yet\r\nhe provided an Englishman, who had come to propose the experiment to\r\nhim, with all the necessary funds. \"I was perfectly certain that I\r\nshould never see him again,\" he said afterwards; but, with all due\r\ndeference, we may take this as a shamefaced denial of his credulity.\r\n\"Contrary to my expectations,\" M. Joigneux went on, when he told us the\r\ntale a few nights afterwards at the Café de la Paix--he lived in the Rue\r\ndu 4 Septembre,--\"my Englishman did come back, accompanied by a porter\r\nwho carried the requisite material. I did not interfere with him in the\r\nleast, but merely watched him. I knew that in England they did produce\r\n'greenstuff' in that way; though I was also aware of the difference\r\nbetween a few blades and a serious crop.\"\r\n\r\nOthers, more ingenious still, began to argue that if it was possible to\r\nproduce vegetables in a fortnight by means of light and a few handfuls\r\nof mould, it could not be difficult to produce mushrooms with a much\r\nthicker layer of mould and in the darkness of a cellar.\r\n\r\nFortunately there is, as yet, a very decent kitchen-garden to fall back\r\nupon. It lies between the fortifications and the forts; it has been\r\nsomewhat pillaged at first, but the authorities have organized several\r\ncompanies of labourers from among those whom they have not been able to\r\nprovide with arms, and those who do not dig or delve keep watch against\r\ndepredation. They have a very simple uniform--a black kepi with crimson\r\npiping, and a crimson belt round their waists. They are exposed to a\r\ncertain danger, for every now and then a stray German bullet lays one of\r\nthem low, but, upon the whole, their lot is not a hard one.\r\n\r\n\"We have still nearly everything we want,\" writes a facetious\r\njournalist; \"and now that good and obliging fellow, Gambetta, is going\r\nto fetch us some cream cheese from the moon for our dessert.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, during the last few days, we have been informed of the Minister\r\nof the Interior's impending departure for Tours by balloon on the 7th of\r\nOctober, and by twelve o'clock on that day the little Place St. Pierre,\r\nright on the heights of Montmartre, is simply black with people. \"The\r\ngreat statesman,\" the \"hero who is to rouse the provinces to unheard-of\r\nefforts for the deliverance of the sacred soil of France from the\r\npolluting presence of the Teutonic barbarian,\" has not arrived yet when\r\nI edge my way through the crowd, accompanied by an officer on General\r\nVinoy's staff, who is a near relative of mine. With the recollection of\r\nmy adventure in the Avenue de Clichy fresh upon me, I would not have\r\nventured to come by myself. There is a military post on the Place St.\r\nPierre, and I am wondering whether it will turn out to pay honours to\r\n\"the great statesman;\" and whether Nadar, the famous Nadar, whom I can\r\nsee towering above the crowd, and giving instructions, will treat\r\nGambetta with the same scant courtesy he once treated Louis-Napoléon,\r\nwhen the latter went to see the ascent of his balloon, \"Le Géant,\" from\r\nthe Champ-de-Mars. Nadar's behaviour on that occasion reminds one of\r\nElizabeth's with the wife of Bishop Parker. \"'Madam,'\" said the queen,\r\n\"I may not call you, and 'mistress' I am loth to call you.\" Nadar was\r\ntoo fervent a republican to call Louis-Napoléon \"Majesty;\" he was too\r\nwell-bred to insult his guest by addressing him as \"Monsieur:\" so, when\r\nhe saw the sovereign advancing, he backed towards his car, and, before\r\nhe could come up with him, gave orders to \"let go.\"\r\n\r\nI do not know whether Gambetta came in a carriage. It did not make its\r\nappearance on the Place St. Pierre; he probably left it, like meaner\r\nmortals, at the foot of the very steep hill. The cheering was immense,\r\nand he took it as if to the manner born. He was accompanied by M.\r\nSpuller, who was to take the journey with him, and who, even at that\r\ntime, bore a curious likeness to Mr. Spurgeon. M. Spuller did not appear\r\nto claim any of the cheers for himself, for he kept perfectly stolid.\r\nGambetta, on the other hand, bowed repeatedly, at which Nadar grinned.\r\nNadar was always honest, if outspoken. He did not seem particularly\r\npleased with the business in hand, and was evidently determined to get\r\nit over as soon as possible. Gambetta was still standing up, bowing and\r\nwaving his hands, when Nadar gave the order to \"let go\" the ropes, and\r\nthe dictator fell back into the lap of his companion. The balloon rose\r\nrather quickly, and about nine that same night we had the news that the\r\nballoon had safely landed in the Department of the Oise, about twelve\r\nmiles from Clermont.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, the ascent of a balloon with its car containing one or\r\ntwo, sometimes three, wicker cages of carrier-pigeons, becomes a\r\nfavourite spectacle with the Parisians, who would willingly see the\r\ndeparture of a dozen per day. For each departure means not only the\r\nconveyance of a budget of news from the besieged city to the provinces,\r\nit means the return of the winged messengers with perhaps hopeful\r\ntidings that the provinces are marching to the rescue. I am bound to\r\nsay, at the same time, that the terrible anxiety for such rescue did not\r\narise solely from a wish to escape further physical sufferings and\r\nprivations. Three-fourths of the Parisians would have been willing to\r\nput up with worse for the sake of one terrible defeat inflicted upon the\r\nGermans by their levies or by those in the provinces.\r\n\r\nBut though the gas companies did wonders, fifty-two balloons having been\r\ninflated by them during the siege, they could do no more. Nevertheless,\r\nthe experiments continue: the brothers Goddard have established their\r\nhead-quarters at the Orléans Railway; MM. Dartois and Yon at the\r\nNorthern; Admiral Labrousse, who has already invented an ingenious\r\ngun-carriage, is now busy upon a navigable balloon; the Government\r\ngrants a subsidy of forty thousand francs to M. Dupuy de Lôme to assist\r\nhim in his research; and at the Grande Hôtel there is a permanent\r\nexhibition of appliances for navigating the air under the direction of\r\nMM. Horeau and Saint-Felix. The public flock to them, and for a moment\r\nthere is the hope that if we ourselves cannot come and go as free as\r\nbirds, there will be at least a means of permanent communication with\r\nthe outer world that way. M. Granier has proposed to make an aerial\r\ntelegraph without the support of poles. The wire is to be enclosed in a\r\ngutta-percha tube filled with hydrogen gas, which will enable it to keep\r\nits altitude a thousand or fifteen hundred meters above the earth. The\r\ncable is to be paid out by balloons. M. Gaston Tissandier, a well-known\r\nauthority in such matters, looks favourably upon the experiment; but,\r\nalas, it comes to nothing, and we have to fall back upon less ingenious,\r\nmore commonplace means.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we are offering tempting fees to plucky individuals who\r\nwill attempt to cross the Prussian lines. Several do make the attempt,\r\nand for a week or so the newspapers and the walls swarm with\r\nadvertisements of a private firm who will forward and receive despatches\r\nat the rate of ten francs per letter. A good many messengers depart; a\r\ngood many return almost at once, finding the task impossible; those that\r\ndo not return have presumably been shot by the Prussians, for not a\r\nsingle one reached his destination.\r\n\r\nThen we begin to turn our thoughts to the sheep-dog as a carrier of\r\nmessengers, or rather to the smuggler's dog, thousands of which are\r\nknown to exist on the Belgian and Swiss frontiers. The postal\r\nauthorities go even so far as to promise two hundred francs for every\r\nbatch of despatches if delivered within twenty-four hours of the\r\nanimal's departure from his starting-place, and fifty francs less for\r\nevery twenty-four hours' delay; but the animals fall a prey to the\r\nPrussian sentries, not one of them succeeds in reaching the French\r\noutposts. The carrier-pigeon is all we have left.\r\n\r\nStill, we are not discouraged; and in less than a month after the\r\ninvestment, the Parisians begin to clamour for their favourite\r\namusement--the theatre. There are, of course, many divergencies of\r\nopinion with regard to the fitness of the measure, and we get some\r\ncapital articles on the subject, studded with witty sentences and\r\nrelieved by historical anecdotes, showing that, whatever they may not\r\nknow, French journalists have an inexhaustible fund of parallels when it\r\nbecomes a question of the playhouse. \"In '92 the Lillois went peacefully\r\nto the theatre while the shells were pouring into the devoted city. Why\r\nshould we be less courageous and less cheerful than they?\" writes one.\r\n\"Nero was fiddling while Rome was burning,\" writes another, \"but Paris\r\nis not on fire yet; and, if it were, the Nero who might be blamed for\r\nthe catastrophe is at Wilhelmshöhe, where, we may be sure, he will not\r\neat a mouthful less for our pangs of hunger. If he does not fiddle, it\r\nis because, like his famous uncle, he has no ear for music.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may happen,\" writes M. Francisque Sarcey in the _Gaulois_,\r\n\"art should be considered superior to all things; the theatre is not a\r\nmore unseemly pleasure under the circumstances than the perusal of a\r\ngood book; and it is just in the darkest and saddest hours of his life\r\nthat a man needs a diversion which will, for a little while, at least,\r\nprevent him from brooding upon his sufferings.\"\r\n\r\nTo which \"Thomas Grimm,\" of _Le Petit Journal_, who is on the opposite\r\nside, replies: \"If I may be allowed to intervene in so grave a question,\r\nI have no hesitation in saying that the time for singing and amusing\r\nourselves has not arrived. It seems to me very doubtful whether the\r\nspectators would not be constantly thinking of scenes enacted in other\r\nspots than behind the footlights. And in such moments, when they might\r\nconcentrate the whole of their attention on the pleasant fiction enacted\r\nbefore them, the sound of the cannon thundering in the distance would\r\nmore than once recall them to the reality.\"\r\n\r\nThe ice was virtually broken, and on Sunday, the 23rd of October, the\r\nCirque National opened its doors for a concert. During the last five\r\nyears, as my readers will perceive by the almost involuntary break in\r\nthese notes, I had not been so assiduous a frequenter of the theatre and\r\nthe concert hall as I used to be, and though I was during the siege\r\noverburdened with business, on the nature of which I need not dwell\r\nhere, I felt that I wanted some amusement. The evenings were becoming\r\nchilly, one of my cherished companions was doing his duty with General\r\nVinoy, and, though I had practically unlimited means at my command for\r\nmy necessities, and am by no means sparing of money at any time, I\r\ngrudged the price of fuel. As yet, wood only cost six francs the\r\nhundredweight, but it was such wood! If the ancient proverb-coiner had\r\nbeen seated in front of the hearth in which it was trying to burn, he\r\nmight have hesitated to write that \"there is no smoke without a fire.\"\r\nThe friendly chats by the fireside, which I had enjoyed for many years,\r\nhad almost entirely ceased. Nearly all my familiars were \"on duty,\" and\r\nthe few hours they could snatch were either spent in bed, to rest from\r\nthe fatigue and discomforts of the night, or else at the cafés and\r\nrestaurants, where the news, mostly of an anecdotal kind, was\r\ncirculating freely. In fact, the cafés and restaurants, as long as there\r\nwas fuel and light, were more amusing during the siege than I had known\r\nthem to be at any time. Perhaps the most amusing feature of these\r\nnightly gatherings was the presentation of the bill after dinner. The\r\nprices charged at the Café de Paris in its palmiest days were child's\r\nplay compared to the actual ones. I have preserved the note of a\r\nbreakfast for two at Durand's.\r\n\r\n                                             frs.\r\n  Hors d'Oeuvres (Radishes and Sausage)       10\r\n  Entrée (Navarin aux Pommes)                 18\r\n  Filet de Boeuf aux Champignons              24\r\n  Omelette Sucrée (3 oeufs)                   12\r\n  Café                                         1\r\n  1 Bouteille de Mâcon                         6\r\n                                              --\r\n                               Total frs.     71\r\n\r\nThe bread and butter were included in the hors-d'oeuvres, and I may\r\nremark that the entrée and the filet de boeuf were only for one.\r\nDurand's was the cheapest of the five restaurants which still retained\r\ntheir ordinary clientèle. Bignon, Voisin, the Cafés de la Paix and\r\nAnglais were much dearer. The latter gave its patrons white bread as\r\nlate as the 16th of December.\r\n\r\nI made up my mind, then, to go to that concert at the Cirque National,\r\nand to as many of the entertainments as might be offered. I have rarely\r\nseen such a crowd outside a theatre; and I doubt whether the fact of the\r\nperformance being for a charitable purpose had much to do with it,\r\nbecause, if so, those who were denied admission might have handed their\r\nmoney at the box-office, but they did not, they only gave the reverse of\r\ntheir blessing. If charity it was, it did not want to end at home that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment began with a charity sermon by the Abbé Duquesnay, a\r\nhard-working priest in one of the thickly populated quarters of Paris. I\r\nwould willingly give another ten francs to hear a similar sermon. I am\r\npositive that the Abbé had taken Laurence Sterne for his model. I have\r\nnever heard anything so brilliant in my life. Not the slightest attempt\r\nat thrusting religion down one's throat. A good many quotations on the\r\nadvantages of well-doing, notably that of Shakespeare, admirably\r\ntranslated, probably by the speaker himself. Then the following to wind\r\nup with: \"I do not know of a single curmudgeon who has ever been\r\nconverted into what I should call 'a genuine almsgiver,' by myself, or\r\nby my fellow-priests. When he did give, he looked upon the gift as a\r\nloan to the Lord in virtue of that gospel precept which you all know.\r\nNow, my good friends, allow me to give you my view of that sentence: God\r\nis just, and no doubt He will repay the loan with interest, but after He\r\nhas settled the account, He will indict the lender before the Highest\r\ntribunal for usury. Consequently, if you have an idea of placing your\r\nmoney in that way with God as a security, you had better keep it in your\r\npurses.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, the orchestra, nine-tenths of whose members are in uniform,\r\nperforms the overture to \"La Muette de Portici\" (Masaniello); Pasdeloup\r\nconducting. Pasdeloup is a naturalized German, whose real name is\r\nWolfgang, but, in this instance, the public do not seem to mind it; nor\r\nis there any protest against the names of two other Germans on the\r\nprogramme, Weber's and Beethoven's. On the contrary, the latter's\r\ncomposition is frantically encored. I believe it is the symphony in _C\r\nMinor_, for it has been wedded to Victor Hugo's words, and it is Madame\r\nUgalde who sings the stirring hymn \"Patria.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a story connected with this hymn, which is not generally known.\r\nI give it as it was told to me a day or so afterwards by Auber, who had\r\nit from the lips of Joseph Dartigues, who, at the time of its\r\noccurrence, was the musical critic of the _Journal des Débats_.\r\n\r\nHugo was very young then, and one night he went to the Théâtre de\r\nMadame, which has since become the Gymnase. The piece was one of\r\nScribe's--\"La Chatte metamorphosée en Femme;\" and Jenny Vertpré, whom\r\nour grandfathers applauded at the St. James Theatre in the thirties, was\r\nto play the principal part. Still, our poet was not particularly struck\r\nwith the plot, dialogue, or lyrics; but, all at once, he sat upright in\r\nhis seat, at the strains of a \"Hindoo invocation.\" When the music\r\nceased, Hugo left the house, humming the notes to himself. He was very\r\nfond of music, though he could never reconcile himself to have his\r\ndramas appropriated by the librettists, and gave his consent but very\r\nreluctantly. Next morning, he met Dartigues on the Boulevard des\r\nItaliens, then the Boulevard de Gand. He told him what he had heard, and\r\nrecommended the critic to go and judge for himself. \"It is so utterly\r\ndifferent from the idiotic stuff one generally hears.\" Dartigues acted\r\nupon the recommendation. A few days later, they met once more. \"Did you\r\ngo and hear that music, at the Théâtre de Madame?\" asked Hugo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the reply. \"I am not surprised at your liking it; it is\r\nBeethoven's.\"\r\n\r\nCurious to relate, Hugo had not as much as heard the name of the great\r\nGerman composer. The acquaintance with classical music was very limited\r\nin the France of those days. But Hugo never forgot the symphony, and,\r\nlater on, in his exile, he wrote the words I had just heard.\r\n\r\nThe impulse has been given, and from that moment the walls of Paris\r\ndisplay as many bills of theatrical and musical entertainments as if the\r\nGermans were not at the gates. I go to nearly all, and, to my great\r\nregret, hear a great many actors and actresses who have received favours\r\nand honours at the hand of Louis-Napoléon vie with one another in\r\ncasting obloquy upon him and his reign. One of the few honourable\r\nexceptions is M. Got, who, being invited to recite Hugo's \"Châtiments,\"\r\nemphatically refuses \"to kick a man when he is down.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Théâtre-Français, there is a special box--the erstwhile Imperial\r\nbox--for the convalescents, who are being tended in the theatre itself.\r\n\r\nBut though I went to hear Melchisedec and Taillade, Caron and\r\nBerthelier, there is one performance that stands out vividly from the\r\nrest in my memory. It was a representation of Hugo's \"Le Roi s'amuse\"\r\n(\"The Fool's Revenge\"), at the theatre at Montmartre. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, I should probably not have gone so far afield to see any\r\npiece, not even that which was reputed to be _the masterpiece_ of Victor\r\nHugo, but, in this instance, the temptation was too great. The play had\r\nonly been performed in Paris once--on the 22nd of November, 1832; next\r\nday it was suspended by order of the Government. Alexandre Dumas the\r\nelder, Théophile Gautier, Nestor Roqueplan, all of whom were present on\r\nthat memorable night, had spoken to me of its beauties. I had often\r\npromised myself to read it, and had never done so. If I had, I should\r\nprobably not have gone to Montmartre that night, lest my illusions\r\nshould be disturbed. The performance was intended as a tribute to the\r\ngenius of the poet, but also as an act of defiance on the part of the\r\nyoung Republic to the preceding régimes; though why it was not revived\r\nduring the Second Republic I have never been able to make out clearly.\r\n\r\nMy companion and I toiled up the steep Rue des Martyrs, and it was\r\nevident to us, when we got to the Place du Théâtre, that something\r\nunusual was going on, for the little square was absolutely black with\r\npeople. We managed, however, to elbow our way through, and to get two\r\nstalls. The house was dimly lighted by gas, the deficiency made up, as\r\nfar I could see, by lamps in the auditorium, by candles on the stage.\r\nThere was not an empty seat anywhere. The overture, consisting of\r\nsnatches from \"Rigoletto,\" was received with deafening applause, and\r\nthen the curtain rose upon the magnificent hall in the Louvre of\r\nFrançois I., with the king surrounded by his courtiers and his\r\nfavourites. By his side hobbled Triboulet, his evil genius, as Hugo has\r\nrepresented him.\r\n\r\nMy disappointment was great. I had come to admire, not expecting\r\nmagnificent scenery, gorgeous costumes, or transcendent acting, but a\r\nspirit of reverence for the immortal creation of a great poet. At that\r\ntime I was not sufficiently familiar with provincial art in England to\r\nbe able to picture a performance of Shakespeare except under conditions\r\nsuch as prevail in the best of London theatres. I had read accounts,\r\nhowever, of strolling companies and their doings, but I doubt whether\r\nthe humblest would have been guilty of such utter iconoclasm in the\r\nspirit as well as in the letter as I witnessed that night. It was not\r\ncomic, it was absolutely painful. It was not the glazed calico doing\r\nduty for brocade, that made me wince; it was not the anti-macassar\r\nreplacing lace that made me gasp for breath: it was the miserable\r\nfailure of those behind the footlights, as well as of those in front, to\r\ngrasp the meaning of the simplest line. They had been told that this\r\nplay was an indictment, not against a libertine king, but against\r\ngenerations and generations of rulers to whom debauch was as the air\r\nthey breathed. And, in order to make the lesson more striking,\r\nSaint-Vallier was represented as an old dotard, Triboulet as a pander,\r\nthe king as an amorous Bill Sykes, and Triboulet's daughter as an\r\nhysterical young woman who virtually gloried in her dishonour. I had\r\nseen \"Orphée aux Enfers,\" \"La Belle Hélène,\" and \"La Grande Duchesse;\" I\r\nhad heard Schneider at her best and at her worst; I had heard women of\r\nbirth and breeding titter, and gentlemen roar, at allusions which would\r\nmake a London coalheaver blush;--I had never seen anything so downright\r\ndegrading as this performance. And when, at last, the _dramatis personæ_\r\ngathered round a bust of Hippocrates--the best substitute for one of\r\nVictor Hugo they could find,--and one of them recited \"Les Châtiments,\"\r\nI left, hoping that I should never see such an exhibition again. It was\r\none of the first deliberately planned lessons in \"king-hatred\" I had\r\nheard. The disciples looked to me very promising, and the Commune, when\r\nit came, was not such a surprise to me, after all. Before then, I had\r\ncome to the conclusion that the _barbarians_ outside the gates of Paris\r\nwere less to be feared than those inside--the former, at any rate,\r\nbelieved in a chief; the motto of the others was, \"Ni Dieu, ni maître.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the long winter nights have come. The stock of gas is pretty\r\nwell exhausted, or tantamount to it; wood, similar to that I have\r\ndescribed already, has risen to seven francs fifty centimes the\r\nhundredweight. Beef and mutton have entirely disappeared from the\r\nbutchers' stalls. Rats are beginning to be sold at one franc apiece, and\r\neggs cost thirty francs a dozen. Butter has risen to fifty francs the\r\nhalf-kilogramme (about seventeen ozs., English). Carrots and potatoes\r\nfetch, the first, forty francs, the second, twenty francs, the peck\r\n(English). I am being told that milk is still to be had, but I have\r\nneither tasted nor seen any for ten days. Personally, I do not feel the\r\nwant of it; but in my visits to some of the poor in my neighbourhood I\r\nam confronted by the fact of little ones, between two and three years of\r\nage, being fed on bread soaked in wine, and suffering from various\r\nailments in consequence.\r\n\r\nI am pursuing some inquiries at the various mairies, and find that the\r\ndeath-rate for October has reached nearly three thousand above the\r\ncorresponding month of the previous year. I am furthermore told that not\r\na third of this increase is due to the direct results of the siege--that\r\nis, to death on the battle-field, or resulting from wounds received\r\nthere; typhus and low fever, anæmia, etc., are beginning to ravage the\r\ninhabitants. Worse than all, the authorities have made a mistake with\r\nregard to the influx of strangers. The seventy-five thousand aliens and\r\nParisians who have left at the beginning of the siege have been replaced\r\nby three times that number, so that Paris has virtually one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand more mouths to feed than it counted upon. \"All the women,\r\nchildren, and old men,\" says one of my informants, \"ought to have been\r\nremoved to some provincial centre; it would have cost no more, and would\r\nhave left those who remained free for a more energetic defence. And you\r\nwill scarcely believe it, monsieur, but here is the register to prove\r\nit; there have been nearly four hundred marriages celebrated during the\r\npast month. It looks to me like tying the Gordian knot with a\r\nvengeance.\"\r\n\r\nOne thing I cannot help remarking amidst all this suffering; the\r\nParisian never ceases to be witty. Among my pensioners there was the\r\nwife of a hard-working, frugal upholsterer, whose trade was absolutely\r\nat a standstill. He was doing his duty on the fortifications; she was\r\nkeeping the home together on the meagre pittance allowed to her husband\r\nby the Government, and the rations doled out to her every morning. The\r\nyoungest of her three children was barely four weeks old. One morning,\r\nto my great surprise, I found two infants in her lap. \"C'est comme ça,\r\nmonsieur,\" she said, with a wan smile. \"André found it on a doorstep in\r\nthe Rue Mogador, and he brought it home, saying, 'It won't make much\r\ndifference; Nature laid the table for two infants.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Parisian is a born lounger. Balzac had said, \"Flâner est une\r\nscience, c'est la gastronomie de l'oeil.\" Seeing that it is the only\r\ngastronomy they can enjoy under the circumstances, the Parisians take to\r\nit with a vengeance during those months of October and November, and\r\ntheir favourite halting-places are the rare provision-shops that have\r\nstill a fowl, or a goose, or a pigeon in their windows. The sight of a\r\nturkey causes an obstruction, and the would-be purchaser of a rabbit is\r\nmobbed like the winner of a great prize in the lottery. Nine times out\r\nof ten the negotiations do not go beyond the preliminary stage of\r\ninquiring the price, because vendors are obstinate, though polite.\r\n\r\n\"How much for the rabbit?\" says the supposed Nabob, for the very fact of\r\ninquiring implies wealth.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-five francs, monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are joking. Forty-five francs! It's simply ridiculous,\" protests\r\nthe other one.\r\n\r\n\"I am not joking, monsieur; and I cannot take a farthing less.\"\r\n\r\nThe would-be diner goes away; but he has scarcely gone a few steps, when\r\nthe dealer calls him back. \"Listen, monsieur,\" he cries.\r\n\r\nHope revives in the other's breast. His fancy conjures up a savoury\r\nrabbit-stew, and he leaps rather than walks the distance that separates\r\nhim from the stall.\r\n\r\n\"Ventre affamé a des oreilles pour sûr,\" says a bystander.[85]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 85: The proverb is, \"Ventre affamé n'a pas\r\n         d'oreilles.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"Well, how much are you going to take off?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to take off a penny, but I thought I might tell you that\r\nthis rabbit plays the drum.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the jokes, though, were not equally innocent, and revealed a\r\ncallousness on the part of the perpetrators which it is not pleasant to\r\nhave to record. True, they did not affect the very poor, whose poverty\r\nwas, as it were, a guarantee against them; but it is a moot point\r\nwhether the well-to-do should be shamelessly robbed by the well-to-do\r\ntradesmen for no other reason than to increase the latter's hoard.\r\nGreed, that abominable feature in the character of the French\r\nmiddle-classes, showed itself again and again under circumstances which\r\nought to have suspended its manifestations for the time being.\r\n\r\nI have already noted that one member of the Académie des Sciences had\r\ninsisted upon the benefits to be derived from the extraction of gelatine\r\nfrom bones. A great number of equally learned men simply scouted the\r\nidea as preposterous, notably Dr. Gannal, the well-known authority on\r\nembalming. His opposition went so far as to prompt him to submit his\r\nfamily and himself to the \"ordeal,\" as he called it. At the end of a\r\nweek, all of them were reduced to mere skeletons; and then, but then\r\nonly, Dr. Gannal sent for his learned colleagues to attest the effects.\r\nThe drowning man will proverbially cling to a straw; consequently, some\r\nParisians took to gelatine, undeterred by the clever lampoons, one of\r\nwhich I quote:\r\n\r\n  \"L'inventeur de la gélatine,\r\n   À la chair préférant les os,\r\n   Veut désormais que chacun dîne\r\n   Avec un jeu of dominos.\"\r\n\r\nThey, however, did so with their eyes open, and as a last resource; not\r\nso those who were imposed upon, and induced to part with their money for\r\ncleverly imitated calves' heads, which, as a matter of course, merely\r\nleft a gluish substance at the bottom of the saucepan, to the\r\nindignation of anxious housewives and irate cooks, one of whom took her\r\nrevenge one day by clapping the saucepan and its contents on the head of\r\nthe fraudulent dealer, and, while the latter was in an utterly\r\ndefenceless state, triumphantly stalking away with two very respectable\r\nfowls. The shopkeeper had the impudence to seek redress in a court of\r\nlaw. The judge would not so much as listen to him.\r\n\r\nAnother curious feature of the siege was the sudden passion developed by\r\ncooks for what I must be permitted to call culinary literature. As a\r\nrule, the French cordon-bleu, and even her less accomplished sisters,\r\ndo not go for their recipes to cookery-books; theirs is knowledge gained\r\nfrom actual experience: but at that period such works as, \"Le Livre de\r\nCuisine de Mademoiselle Marguerite,\" \"La Cuisinière Pratique,\" etc.,\r\nwere to be found on every kitchen table. The cooks had simply taken to\r\nthem in despair, not believing a single word of their contents, but on\r\nthe chance of finding a hint that might lend itself to the provisions\r\nplaced at their disposal. I refrain from giving their criticisms on the\r\nauthors: the forcibleness of their language could only be done justice\r\nto by such masters of realism as M. Zola. I have spoken before now of\r\nthe uniform good temper of the Parisians under the most trying\r\ncircumstances; I beg to append a rider, excluding cooks, but especially\r\nfemale ones. \"C'est comme si on essayait d'enseigner le patinage à la\r\nfemme aux jambes de bois du boulevard,\" said the ministering angel to\r\none of my bachelor friends. One day, to my great surprise, on calling on\r\nhim I found him reading. He was not much given to poring over books,\r\nthough his education had been a very good one.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am reading More's 'Utopia,'\" he said, putting down the volume.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I remarked, pointing to the cover, displaying a\r\nyoung woman bending over stew-pans.\r\n\r\n\"This is More's 'Utopia,' to me at present. It speaks of things which\r\nwill never be realized; suprême de volaille, tournedos à la poivrade,\r\nand so forth. The book wants another chapter,\" he went on, \"a chapter\r\ntreating of the food of besieged cities. The Dutch might have written it\r\ncenturies ago: at Leyden they were on the point of eating their left\r\narms, while defending themselves with their right; they could have told\r\nus how to stew the former. If one could add a chapter to that effect,\r\nthe book might go through a hundred new editions, and the writer might\r\nmake a fortune. It would not do him much good, for he would be expected\r\nto live up to his precepts, and not touch a morsel of that beautiful\r\nkangaroo or elephant I saw yesterday on the Boulevard Haussmann.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a mutual acquaintance came in. He had been a lieutenant\r\nin the Foreign Legion, and lost his right foot before Constantine.\r\nNoticing our host's doleful looks, he inquired the cause, and we got\r\nanother spoken essay on the difficulties of the situation as connected\r\nwith the food supply. I may add that, wherever a few men were gathered\r\ntogether, this became invariably the absorbing topic of conversation.\r\n\r\nThe ex-lieutenant laughed outright. \"You are altogether labouring under\r\na mistake; there is plenty of food of a kind left, though I admit with\r\nyou that the Parisian does not know how to prepare it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you teach them?\" was the query.\r\n\r\n\"I will not, because they would simply sneer at me. Feeding is simply a\r\nmatter of prejudice; and, to prove it to you, I will give you a\r\nbreakfast to-morrow morning which you will appreciate. But I am not\r\ngoing to tell you of what it consists, nor will I do so until two days\r\nafter the entertainment.\"\r\n\r\nWe accepted the invitation, though I must confess that I was not eager\r\nabout it. Nevertheless, next day, about one, we were seated at the\r\nhospitable board of our ex-lieutenant, who, three weeks before, had\r\ndismissed his female servant and was waited upon by an old trooper, with\r\none arm. Though perfectly respectful, Joseph received us with a broad\r\ngrin, which, as the repast progressed, was contracted into a proud\r\nsmile. He had evidently co-operated with his master in the concoction of\r\nthe dishes, all of which, I am bound to say, were very savoury. In fact,\r\nI was like that new tenant of the house haunted by a laughing ghost. But\r\nfor the knowledge that there was something uncanny about it, I would\r\nhave been intensely gratified and amused. Our host told us, with great\r\nglee, that Joseph had been up since a quarter-past four that morning;\r\nand that before five he was at the Halles. As we could distinctly taste\r\nthe onions in the stew that served as an entrée, and as the potatoes\r\nround the next dish were visible to the naked eye, we concluded that the\r\nold trooper had got up so early to buy vegetables, and were\r\ncorrespondingly grateful. There was no mystery whatsoever about the\r\nfish, and about the entremets. The first was dry cod--but with a sauce\r\nsuch as I had never tasted before or have since. The latter was a\r\ndelicious dish of sweet macaroni, fit to set before a prince. I repeat,\r\nbut for my knowledge that there was something uncanny about that meal, I\r\nwould have asked permission to come every day. Yet I felt almost equally\r\nconvinced that, with regard to one dish, we had been doubly\r\nmystified--that they were larks, which our host had managed to procure\r\nsomehow, though I missed the bones.\r\n\r\nTrue to his word, our Amphitryon revealed the real ingredients of the\r\nmenu forty-eight hours after. The entrée had been composed of very small\r\nmice--field-mice, I think we call them in England; the second dish was\r\nrat. Not a single ounce of butter or lard had been used in the sauces or\r\nfor the macaroni. The dried cod was still plentiful enough to be had at\r\nany grocer's or salted provision shop. Instead of butter, Joseph used\r\nhorse-marrow. The horse-butchers sold the bones ridiculously cheap, not\r\nhaving the slightest idea what to do with them. The mice, Joseph caught\r\nround about the fortifications, whither he went almost every day. The\r\nrats he caught in the cellarage of the Halles. He had a cousin there in\r\na large way of business, and access to the underground part of the\r\nmarket was never refused to him.\r\n\r\n\"From what you have tasted at my rooms,\" concluded the ex-lieutenant,\r\n\"you will easily see that our vaunted superiority as cooks is so much\r\nhumbug. The dish of cod I gave you, and which you liked so much, may be\r\nseen on the table of the poorest household in Holland and Flanders at\r\nleast once, sometimes twice, a week, especially in North-Brabant, where\r\nthe good Catholics scarcely ever eat anything else on Fridays. The\r\nsauce, which they call a mustard-sauce, would naturally be better if\r\nmade with butter, but you could not taste the difference if the cook\r\ntakes care to sprinkle a little saffron in her fat or marrow. Saffron is\r\na great thing in cooking, and still our best chefs know little or\r\nnothing about it. But for the saffron, you would have detected a slight\r\nodour of musk in the entrée you took to be larks. You may almost\r\ndisguise anything with saffron, except dog's-flesh. Listen to what I\r\ntell you, and in a month or so, perhaps before, you'll admit the truth\r\nof my words. The moment horseflesh fails, the Parisians will fall back\r\nupon dogs, turning up their noses at cats and rats, though both are a\r\nthousand times superior to the latter. In saying this, I am virtually\r\nlibelling the cat and the rat; for 'the friend of man,' be he cooked in\r\never so grand a way, is always a detestable dish. His flesh is oily and\r\nflabby; stew him, fry him, do what you will, there is always a flavour\r\nof castor oil about him. The only way to minimize that flavour, to make\r\nhim palatable, is to salt, or rather to pepper him; that is, to cut him\r\nup in slices, and leave them for a fortnight, bestrewing them very\r\nliberally with pepper-corns. Then, before 'accommodating' them finally,\r\nput them into boiling water for a while, and throw the water away.\r\n\r\n\"No such compromises are necessary with 'the fauna of the tiles,' who,\r\nwith his larger-sized victim, the rat, has been the most misprized and\r\nmisjudged of all animals, from the culinary point of view. Stewed puss\r\nis by far more delicious than stewed rabbit. The flesh of the former\r\ntastes less pungent than that of the latter, and is more tender. As for\r\nthe prejudice against cat, well, the Germans have the same prejudice\r\nagainst rabbit, and while I was in the Foreign Legion there was a\r\nWurtemberger, a lieutenant, who would not touch bunny, but who would\r\ndevour grimalkin. Those who have not tasted couscoussou of cat, prepared\r\naccording to the Arabian recipe--though the Arabs won't touch it--have\r\nnever tasted anything.\"[86]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 86: The Arab _kuskus_ generally consists of a piece\r\n         of mutton baked in a paste with the vegetables of the season,\r\n         flavoured with herbs; and the addition of half a dozen\r\n         hard-boiled eggs. The whole of the flesh is boned.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nOur friend said much more, notably with regard to rat and horseflesh;\r\nand then he wound up: \"But what is the good? Those who might benefit by\r\nmy advice are not here, and, if they were, they would probably scorn it;\r\nI mean the very poor. The only item of animal food which cannot be\r\nadequately replaced by something else yielding as much or nearly as much\r\nnourishment is milk. But, unless an adult be in delicate health or\r\nsuffering from ailments to the alleviation and cure of which milk is\r\nabsolutely necessary, he may very well go without it for six months. Not\r\nso children. I am only showing you that the poor, with their slender\r\nresources--and Heaven knows they are slender enough--might do better\r\nthan they are doing, for cats and rats must still be very plentiful,\r\nonly they won't touch them.\"\r\n\r\nThe reference to the very poor and their slender resources recurred more\r\nthan once that evening, but I knew that the authorities were trying to\r\ndo all they could in the way of relieving general and individual\r\ndistress, and that they were admirably seconded by private charity,\r\nwhich not only placed comparatively large sums at their disposal, but\r\nbestirred itself by means of specially appointed committees and\r\nvisitors. The rations of meat (horsemeat) and bread distributed were not\r\nsufficient. The first had already fallen to forty-five grammes per day\r\nper head, the second to three hundred and fifty grammes;[87] they were\r\nto fall much lower. Tickets were also distributed for set meals, with\r\nand without meat. There was, furthermore, a distribution of fuel, albeit\r\nthat there was really no more fuel to distribute. All the wooden seats\r\nin the public thoroughfares, the scaffoldings before the half-finished\r\nbuildings had disappeared. At one of my friend's apartments there was\r\nnone but the outer door left, all the others had been replaced by\r\ncurtains. They had been chopped up to keep his family warm. The fear of\r\nthe terrible landlord may have prevented the poor from imitating this\r\nproceeding. At any rate, I noticed no absent doors in my visits to any\r\nof them. A further supply of meat or bread, even if they had the money,\r\nwas out of the question for them; because, though some shops remained\r\nopen and their owners were compelled to sell according to the tariff set\r\nforth by the municipality, they had nothing to sell. I remember being in\r\nthe Rue Lafayette one morning, near one of those shops, when I saw the\r\nwhole of the crowd, that had been waiting there for hours probably, turn\r\naway disappointed. The assistant had just told them that \"this morning\r\nwe have nothing to sell but preserved truffles.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 87: Five hundred French grammes make seventeen ounces\r\n         English, and a fraction.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I am bound to note the fact that, at the slightest\r\nrumours of peace, the usually empty windows became filled with\r\nartistically arranged pyramids of \"canned\" provisions, at prices\r\nconsiderably below those charged twenty-four hours before, and even\r\nbelow those mentioned in the municipal tariff. Frequent attempts were\r\nmade by the police to discover the hiding-places for this stock, but\r\nthey failed in every instance. Those hiding-places were far away from\r\nthe shops, and the shopkeepers themselves were too wary to be caught\r\nnapping. A stranger might have safely gone in and offered a hundred\r\nfrancs for half a dozen tins of their wares. They would have looked a\r\nperfect blank, and told him they had none to sell: and no wonder; their\r\ndetection would have meant certain death; no earthly power could have\r\nsaved them from the legitimate fury of the populace. And even those who\r\nbought the hidden food at abnormal prices were compelled to preserve\r\nsilence, at the risk of seeing their supplies cut off. One thing is\r\ncertain, and I can unhesitatingly vouch for it. My name had become known\r\nin connection with several committees for the relief of the poor. On the\r\n25th of January, at 11 a.m., when the negotiations between Bismarck and\r\nM. Jules Favre could have been but in the preliminary stage, I received\r\na note, brought by hand, from a grocer in the Faubourg Montmartre,\r\nasking me to call personally, as he had something to communicate which\r\nmight be to the advantage of my protégés. An hour later, I was at his\r\nestablishment, and he offered to sell me five hundred tins of various\r\nprovisions and two hundred and fifty boxes of sardines at two francs\r\neach. It was something like double the ordinary price. A little more\r\nthan three weeks before that date, I had sent a letter to the same man,\r\nasking him for a similar quantity of goods, which I intended to\r\ndistribute as New Year's gifts. The reply was, that he had none, but\r\nthat he might _possibly_ procure them at the rate of five francs a tin\r\nand box. I found out afterwards, that the excellent grocer had a son at\r\nthe Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I need not point out the logical\r\ndeduction.\r\n\r\nI am equally certain that there were large quantities of horseflesh,\r\nsalted or fresh, hidden somewhere; for, as I have already noted, it was\r\nofficially, or at any rate semi-officially stated, that, on the day of\r\nthe conclusion of the armistice, there were thirty thousand live horses\r\nin Paris, and the greater part of these would have been slaughtered by\r\norder of the Government, if the measure had been thought expedient, for\r\nthere is scarcely any need to say that the pretext of their being wanted\r\nfor military purposes would not hold water. A sixth part of them, or\r\nless, would have been amply sufficient for that. In reality, M. Favre\r\nand his colleagues were, by this time, fully convinced that all further\r\nresistance was useless, but they had not the courage to say so frankly,\r\nand they wished to convert the advocates of \"resistance to death\" to\r\ntheir side by aggravating the scarcity of the food supply, as if it were\r\nnot bad enough already. The horses confiscated by the Government for\r\nfood were paid for by them at the rate of between one and two francs per\r\npound, yet there was no possibility of buying a single pound of\r\nhorseflesh, beyond what was distributed at the municipal canteens, for\r\nless than seven or eight francs. Whence this difference?\r\n\r\nButter could be bought for thirty to thirty-five francs per pound, but\r\nsuch butter! Anything worth eating commanded sixty francs. There was a\r\nkind of grease that fetched two francs per pound, but even the poorest\r\nshrank from it, and preferred to eat dry bread, which was composed as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  (FOR A LOAF OF 300 GRAMMES.)\r\n\r\n  75 grammes of wheat.\r\n  15     \"      rye, barley, or peas.\r\n  60     \"      rice.\r\n  90     \"      oats.\r\n  30     \"      chopped straw mixed with starch.\r\n  30     \"      bran.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest, here are some of the prices--at which, however, things\r\nwere not always to be had:--\r\n\r\n                                          frs.\r\n  A dog or a cat                            20\r\n  A rat, crow, or sparrow               3 or 4\r\n  1 lb. of bear's flesh                     12\r\n  1 lb. of venison                          14\r\n  1 lb. of wolf's flesh, or porcupine's      8\r\n  A rabbit                                  40\r\n  A fowl                                    40\r\n  A pigeon                                  25\r\n  A goose                                   80\r\n  A turkey                                 100\r\n  1 lb. of ham (very rare)                  10\r\n  1 lb. of bacon (not so rare)               6\r\n  Eggs (each)                                5\r\n  Haricot beans (per litre)                  8\r\n  Cabbages (each)                           16\r\n  Leeks (each)                               1\r\n  Bushel of carrots (2-3/4 gallons)         75\r\n  Bushel of potatoes                        35\r\n  Bushel of onions                          80\r\n\r\nStill, until the very last, there occurred, as far as I know, no case of\r\nactual starvation, and I was pretty well posted up in that respect. The\r\nvery young and very old suffered most: for the milk that was sold at two\r\nfrancs per litre was simply disgraceful, three-fourths of it was water;\r\nand beef-tea, or that worthy of the name, was not to be had at any\r\nprice. Both commodities were distributed to the poor at the municipal\r\ncanteens, on the certificate of a doctor; but the latter, though by no\r\nmeans hard-hearted, and thoroughly sympathetic with the ills he was\r\nscarcely able to alleviate, had to draw the line somewhere. Of bedding,\r\nbed-linen, and warm underclothing there was little or no lack; but the\r\ncold, for several days, at frequent intervals was severe to a degree.\r\n\r\nOur ex-lieutenant's reference to the poor and their slender resources\r\nrecurred frequently to my mind for several days after the scene\r\ndescribed above, and set me wondering how far the poor had parted,\r\nfinally or temporarily, with their household goods and small valuables\r\nin order to obtain some of the quasi-luxuries I have just enumerated. In\r\norder to get at the truth of the matter, I determined to pay a visit to\r\nthe central pawnbroking office in the Rue des Blancs Manteaux. I\r\nprovided myself with a letter of introduction to the director, who\r\nplaced an official at my disposal. This was towards the latter end of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nI transcribe my informant's statement in brief and from memory, but I am\r\npositive as to main facts. Up till the end of August the transactions at\r\nthe central office, which virtually include those of the whole of the\r\ncapital, presented nothing abnormal, but the moment the investment\r\nbecame an almost foregone conclusion, there was a positive run on the\r\nMont-de-Piété. The applicants for loans, however, were by no means of\r\nthe poorest or even of the lower-middle class, but the well-to-do\r\npeople, whose chief aim was to place their valuables in safety, and who\r\nlooked upon the 9-1/2 per cent. interest they had to pay on the advances\r\nreceived as a premium for warehousing and insurance. They knew that\r\nnothing could be more secure than the fire and burglar proof receptacles\r\nof the Mont-de-Piété, and that, come what might, the State would be\r\nresponsible for the value of the articles deposited.\r\n\r\nThis run ceased when the investment was an accomplished fact, but, as a\r\nmatter of course, the financial resources had been put to a severe test,\r\nand, at the time my informant spoke to me, they had dwindled from nearly\r\neight millions of francs, at which they were computed in the beginning\r\nof August, to about three-quarters of a million. The order of the mayor\r\nof Paris, intended to prevent this, had come too late. The decree of\r\n1863, limiting the maximum of a loan to ten thousand francs at the chief\r\noffice, and to five hundred francs at any of the auxiliary ones, had\r\nbeen suspended in favour of a decision that, during the investment, no\r\nloan should exceed fifty francs.[88] From the 19th of September to the\r\nend of October, the cessation from _all_ labour, and, consequently, the\r\nnon-receipt of wages throughout the capital, had to be faced in the\r\nacceptance of thousands of pledges, consisting of household goods,\r\napparel, etc.; but, curiously enough, workmen's tools and implements\r\nformed but a small proportion of these. At present, the whole of the\r\nbusiness was at a standstill; there was no redemption of pledges, and\r\nfew were offered.[89]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 88: A similar measure had been decided upon in 1814,\r\n         under analogous circumstances, but the maximum was twenty\r\n         francs instead of fifty francs.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 89: A curious feature in connection with the pledging\r\n         of tools and implements may be recorded here. At the\r\n         termination of the siege, a committee in London transmitted\r\n         20,000 francs (£800) for the express purpose of redeeming\r\n         these. The Paris committee entrusted with the task, while\r\n         grateful for the solicitude shown, rightly considered that it\r\n         would not _go_ very far, considering that, at the time, the\r\n         Mont-de-Piété held a total of 1,708,549 articles, representing\r\n         loans to the amount of 37,502,743 francs. The authorities took\r\n         particular pains to publish the receipt of the 20,000 francs,\r\n         and the purposes thereof. Within a given time, they returned\r\n         6,430 francs to the committee. Only 2,383 tools (or sets of\r\n         tools) had been redeemed, representing a lent value of 13,570\r\n         francs.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Christmas and the New Year were at hand, and not a single\r\nsortie had led to any practical modification of the situation. The cold\r\nwas intense. Coal and coke could be obtained for neither money nor love.\r\nThe street lamps had not been lighted for nearly a month; up till the\r\nend of October, one had been lighted here and there; then there had been\r\nan attempt to supply the absence of gas by paraffin in the public\r\nthoroughfares, but the stock of mineral oil was also getting lower. Most\r\nof the shops were closed, but, at the advent of the festive season, a\r\nfew took down their shutters and made a feeble display of bonbons in\r\nsugar and chocolate, and even of marrons glacés. I doubt whether these\r\narticles found many purchasers. The toy-shops never took the trouble of\r\nexhibiting at all. They were wise in their abstention, for even the most\r\nignorant Parisian was aware that nine-tenths of the wares in these\r\nestablishments hailed from Germany, and he would assuredly have smashed\r\nthe windows if they had been offered for sale. Nay, the booths that make\r\ntheir appearance on the Boulevards at that time of the year displayed\r\nfew toys, except of a military kind. It was very touching, in after\r\nyears, to hear the lads and lassies refer to the 1st of January, 1871,\r\nas _the New Year's Day without the New Year's gifts_.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it must not be thought that Paris was given over to\r\nmelancholy on these two days. Crowds perambulated the streets and sat in\r\nthe cafés. In spite of all that has been said by ultra-patriotic\r\nwriters, I am inclined to think that the Parisians no longer cherished\r\nany illusions about the possibility of retrieving their disasters,\r\nthough many may have thought that the besiegers would abstain, at the\r\nlast moment, from shelling the city. The Government--whether with the\r\nintention of cheering the besieged or for the purpose of exhausting\r\ntheir stock of provisions as quickly as possible, in order to capitulate\r\nwith better grace--had made the city a magnificent New Year's gift of\r\n\r\n  104,000 kilogrammes of preserved beef,\r\n   52,000       \"     \" dried haricot beans,\r\n   52,000       \"     \" olive oil,\r\n   52,000       \"     \" coffee (not roasted),\r\n   52,000       \"     \" chocolate;\r\n\r\nwhich gift elicited the reply of a group of artists and littérateurs\r\nthat, though thankful for their more epicurean brethren and sisters,\r\nthey, the littérateurs and artists, had fared very well on Christmas Day\r\nand would meet again on New Year's Day to discuss the following menu:--\r\n\r\n  \"Consommé de Cheval au millet.\r\n  Brochettes de Foie de Chien à la Maître d'Hôtel.\r\n  Émincé de Râble de Chat, Sauce Mayonnaise.\r\n  Épaules et Filets de Chien braisés à la Sauce Tomate.\r\n  Civet de Chat aux Champignons.\r\n  Cotelettes de Chien aux Champignons.\r\n  Gigots de Chien flanqués de Ratons.\r\n  Sauce Poivrade.\r\n  Bégonias au Jus.\r\n  Plum-pudding au Rhum et à la Moelle de Cheval.\"\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the publication of the menu, a dealer in the St.\r\nGermain Market put up a new signboard:--\r\n\r\n  \"RÉSISTANCE À OUTRANCE.\r\n\r\n  \"GRANDE BOUCHERIE CANINE ET FÉLINE.\r\n\r\n  \"L'héroïque Paris brave les Prussiens;\r\n  Il ne sera jamais vaincu par la famine!\r\n  Quand il aura mangé la race chevaline\r\n  Il mangera ses rats, et ses chats, et ses chiens.\"\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of a cookshop in the Rue de Rome had confined himself to\r\nprose, but prose which, to those who could read it aright, was much\r\ncleverer than the poetry of his transpontine fellow-tradesman.\r\n\r\n  \"VIN À DIX-HUIT SOUS ET EAU-DESSUS,\r\n  Rosse Beef.\r\n  Rat Goût de Mouton.\"[90]\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 90: Here are the two English readings, as far as I am\r\n         able to give them:--\r\n\r\n           \"WINE AT EIGHTEEN SOUS THE LITRE AND UPWARDS.\r\n            Roast Beef.\r\n            Ragout of Mutton.\"\r\n\r\n           \"WINE AT EIGHTEEN SOUS THE LITRE AND WATER ATOP.\r\n            Old Crock's Flesh.\r\n            Rat Tasting of Mutton.\"--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have eaten the flesh of elephants, wolves, cassowaries,\r\nporcupines, bears, kangaroos, rats, cats, and horses. I did not touch\r\ndog's-flesh knowingly after I had been warned by our ex-lieutenant. The\r\nproprietor of the English butcher-shop, M. Debos, who was not an\r\nEnglishman at all, supplied most of these strange dishes; for he bought\r\nnearly all the animals from the Zoological Gardens at tremendous prices.\r\nThese were only the animals from the Jardin d'Acclimatation in the Bois,\r\nwhich had been sent as guests to the Jardin des Plantes. The elephants\r\nbelonged to the latter establishment, and were sold to M. Debos for\r\ntwenty-seven thousand francs. In January I was elected a member of the\r\nJockey Club, but I had dined there once before by special invitation. I\r\ngive the menu as far as I remember:--\r\n\r\n  \"Soupe au Poireau.\r\n  Aloyau de Boeuf.\r\n  Poule au Riz.\r\n  Flageolets aux Jus.\r\n  Biscuits de Reims glacés.\r\n  Charlotte aux Pommes.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the hope that Paris would escape being shelled, minute\r\ninstructions how to act, in the event of such a calamity, had been\r\nposted on the walls. In fact, if speechifying and the promulgation of\r\ndecrees could have saved the city, Trochu first, and the rest\r\nafterwards, would have so saved it. But I have solemnly promised myself\r\nat the outset of these notes not to be betrayed into any criticism of\r\nthe military operations, and I will endeavour to keep my promise to\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost result of those directions on the part of the\r\nGovernment was a display of water-butts, filled to the brim, in the\r\npassage, and of sand-heaps in the yard of every building. As the months\r\nwent by, and there was no sign of a bombardment, the contents of the\r\ncasks became so much solid ice, and the sand-heaps disappeared beneath\r\nthe accumulated snow, to be converted into slush and mire at the first\r\nthaw, which gave us, at the same time, a kind of miniature deluge,\r\nbecause, as a matter of course, the barrels had sprung leaks which were\r\nnot attended to at the time.\r\n\r\nAnd when, early on the 5th of January, the first projectiles crashed\r\ndown upon some houses in the south of Paris, the people were simply\r\nastonished, but still deluded themselves into the belief that it was a\r\nmistake, that the \"trajectory\" had been miscalculated, and the shells\r\nhad carried farther than was intended. To a certain extent they had good\r\ngrounds for their supposition. They had heard the big cannon boom and\r\nroar at frequent intervals ever since the morning of the 27th of\r\nDecember, and been given to understand that it was merely a big\r\nartillery duel for the possession of the plateau d'Avron, between the\r\npositions of Noisy-le-Grand and Gournay on the enemy's side, and the\r\nforts of Nogent, Rosny, and Noisy on that of the French. They were,\r\nfurthermore, under the impression that the shelling of the city would be\r\npreceded by a final summons to surrender: they had got that notion\r\nmostly from their military dramas and popular histories. But there were\r\nmen, better informed than the majority of the masses, who made sure\r\nthat, if not the Parisians themselves, the foreign consuls and the\r\naliens under their charge would receive a sufficiently timely notice, in\r\norder to leave the city if they felt so minded.\r\n\r\nThe 5th of January was a bitterly cold day; it had been freezing hard\r\nduring the whole of the night, and, as I wended my way across the Seine,\r\nabout noon, the mist, which had been hanging over the river, was slowly\r\nrising in banked and jagged masses, with only a rift here and there for\r\nthe pitilessly glacial sun to peer through and mock at our shivering\r\ncondition. When I got to the Boulevard Montparnasse, I met several\r\nstretchers, bearing sentries who had been absolutely frozen to within an\r\nace of death.\r\n\r\nI know nothing of the military import of a bombardment, but have been\r\ntold that even the greatest strategists only count upon the moral effect\r\nit produces upon the besieged inhabitants. I can only say this: if\r\nMarshal von Moltke took the \"moral effect\" of his projectiles into his\r\ncalculations to accelerate the surrender of Paris, he might have gone on\r\nshelling Paris for a twelvemonth without being one whit nearer his aim;\r\nthat is, if I am to judge by the scene I witnessed on that January\r\nmorning, before familiarity with the destruction-dealing shells could\r\nhave produced the proverbial contempt. At the risk of offending all the\r\nsensation-mongers, foreign and native, with pen or with pencil, I can\r\nhonestly say that a broken-down omnibus and a couple of prostrate horses\r\nwould have excited as much curiosity as did the sight of the battered\r\ntenements at Vaugirard, Montrouge, and Vanves. On the Chaussée du Maine,\r\nthe roadway had been ploughed up for a distance of about half a dozen\r\nyards by a shell; in another spot, a shell had gone clean through the\r\nroof and killed a woman by the side of her husband; in a third, a shell\r\nhad carried away part of the wall of a one-storied cottage, and the\r\nwhole of the opposite wall: in short, there was more than sufficient\r\nevidence that life was no longer safe within the fortifications, and yet\r\nthere was no wailing, no wringing of hands, no heart-rending frenzied\r\nlook of despair, either pent up or endeavouring to find vent in shrieks\r\nand yells, nay, not even on the part of the women. There was merely a\r\nkind of undemonstrative contempt--very unlike the usual French way of\r\nmanifesting it--blended with a considerable dash of _badauderie_,--for\r\nwhich word I cannot find an English equivalent, because the Parisian\r\nloafer or idler is unlike any of his European congeners. To grasp the\r\ndifference between the former and the latter, one must have had the good\r\nfortune to see the same incident in the streets of Paris, London,\r\nMadrid, Florence, and Rome, Vienna, Berlin, and St. Petersburg, not to\r\nmention Brussels, the Hague, Amsterdam, Munich, and Dresden. The\r\n\"Monsieur Prudhomme\" of Charles Monnier shows but one facet of the Paris\r\nbadaud's character. The nearest approach to him is the middle-class\r\nEnglish tourist on the Continent, who endeavours to explain to his wife\r\nand companions things he does not know himself, and blesses his stars\r\naloud for having made him an Englishman.\r\n\r\nBut even the Paris badaud, who is not unlike his Roman predecessor in\r\nhis craving for circuses, must have bread; and when the cry arises, a\r\nfortnight later, that \"there is no more bread,\" the siege is virtually\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n     Some men of the Commune -- Cluseret -- His opinion of Rossel --\r\n     His opinion of Bergeret -- What Cluseret was fighting for --\r\n     Thiers and Abraham Lincoln -- Raoul Rigault on horseback --\r\n     Théophile Ferré -- Ferré and Gil-Pérès, the actor -- The comic\r\n     men of the Commune -- Gambon -- Jourde, one of the most valuable\r\n     of the lot -- His financial abilities -- His endeavours to save\r\n     -- Jourde at Godillot's -- Colonel Maxime Lisbonne -- The\r\n     Editor's recollections of him -- General Dombrowski and General\r\n     la Cécilia -- A soirée at the Tuileries -- A gala-performance at\r\n     the Opéra Comique -- The death-knell of the Commune.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have before now spoken of a young medical student in whose company I\r\nspent several evenings at a café on the Boulevard St. Michel, during the\r\nEmpire. He, like myself, remained in Paris during the siege, and refused\r\nto stir at the advent of the Commune. As a matter of course, whenever we\r\nmet, while the latter lasted, we rarely spoke of anything else. He\r\nsympathized, to a certain extent, with the principle, though not with\r\nthe would-be expounders of it. I knew few, if any, of the leaders even\r\nby sight, though I had heard of some, such as, for instance, Jules\r\nVallès, in connection with their literary work. My admiration was\r\nstrictly confined to those performances, and I often said so to my\r\nfriend. \"You are mistaken in your estimate of them,\" he invariably\r\nreplied. \"There are men of undoubted talent among them, for instance,\r\nCluseret; but most of them are like square pegs in round holes. Come\r\nwith me to-night, and you will be able to judge for yourself; for he is\r\nsure to be at the Brasserie Saint-Séverin.\"\r\n\r\nI had never been to the Brasserie Saint-Séverin, though I had paid two\r\nor three visits several years before to the café de la Renaissance\r\nopposite the Fontaine Saint-Michel, at which establishment the Commune\r\nmay be said to have been hatched. It was there that, in 1866, Raoul\r\nRigault, Longuet, the brothers Levraud, Dacosta, Genton, Protot, and a\r\ndozen more were arrested by the Commissary of Police, M. Clément.\r\n\r\nThat night, about eight o'clock, we crossed the Pont Saint-Michel, and,\r\nin a minute or so, found ourselves amidst some of the shining lights of\r\nthe Commune.\r\n\r\nSave on review days I had never seen so many brilliant uniforms gathered\r\ntogether. As far as I can recollect, there was only one civilian in the\r\ngroup pointed out to me. He looked a mere skeleton, was misshapen, and\r\none of the ugliest men I have ever met. I asked his name, and was told\r\nit was Tridon. The name was perfectly familiar to me as belonging to one\r\nof the most remarkable polemists during the late régime. A little while\r\nafterwards, Cluseret came in.\r\n\r\nMy friend introduced me, and we sat talking for more than two hours; and\r\nI have rarely been more interested than I was that night. Cluseret spoke\r\nEnglish very well, for he had been in America several years, and our\r\nconversation was carried on in that language. I have already remarked\r\nthat I had no intention, at that time, to jot down my recollections,\r\nstill I was so impressed with what I had heard that I made some rough\r\nmemoranda when I got home. They are among the papers I have preserved.\r\n\r\nCluseret fostered no illusions as to the final upshot of the Commune.\r\n\"If every man were as devoted to the cause as Kossuth and Garibaldi were\r\nto theirs, we should not be able to establish a permanent Commune; but\r\nthis is by no means the case. Most of the leaders, even those who are\r\nnot self-seekers, are too visionary in their aims; they will not abate\r\none jot of their ideal. The others think of nothing but their own\r\naggrandisement, and though many are no doubt capable to a degree, they\r\nare absolutely useless for the posts they have chosen for themselves.\r\nThere are certainly exceptions; such as, for instance, Rossel. His\r\ntechnical knowledge is very considerable. If I had to describe him in\r\ntwo words, I should call him Lothario-Cromwell. For, notwithstanding his\r\nmilitary aptitudes and his Puritan stiffness in many things, he has too\r\nmany petticoats about him. In addition to this, he is overbearing and\r\nabsolutely eaten up with ambition; he is a republican who despises the\r\nproletariat; he would fain imitate the axiom of Napoléon I., 'The tools\r\nto those who can use them;' but he forgets that it will not do for a\r\nsocialistic régime such as we would establish, because it is exactly\r\nthose that cannot use the tools who wish to be treated as if they could.\r\nIf they had intelligence enough to use the tools, they would have lifted\r\nthemselves out of their humble, unsatisfactory positions without any\r\naid. Rossel is no doubt a better strategist than I am, and I do not in\r\nthe least mind his letting me know it, but if Dombrowski or Bergeret was\r\n'Delegate for War,' Rossel would have been in prison or shot a fortnight\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n\"For,\" continued Cluseret, \"Bergeret especially thinks himself a\r\nheaven-born general. He shows well on horseback, because, I believe, he\r\nbegan life as a stable-lad: so did Michel Ney; but then, Michel Ney\r\nserved his apprenticeship at fighting, while Bergeret became a\r\ncompositor, a chef-de-claque, a proof-reader, and, finally, a traveller\r\nfor a publishing firm. All these are, no doubt, very honourable\r\noccupations, but they are scarcely calculated to make a good general.\r\nStill, you should see him: he wears his sash as your officers wear\r\ntheirs when on duty; he would like the people to mistake it for the\r\ngrand-cordon of the Légion d'Honneur; and his staff is more numerous\r\nthan that of the late Emperor. You should go and dine at the\r\nhead-quarters of the military governor of Paris; I am sure you would be\r\nvery welcome. Marast at the Palais-Bourbon in '48 was nothing to it. If\r\nthe Commune lasts another three months there will be servants in livery,\r\ngold lace, and powder, like in your country. At present, Bergeret has to\r\nput up with attendants in faultless black.\r\n\r\n\"Personally,\" he went on, \"I am not fighting for Communism, but for\r\nCommunalism, which, I need not tell you, is quite a different thing. I\r\nfail to see why Paris and Lyons should be judged incapable of managing\r\ntheir own municipal affairs without the interference of the State, while\r\nother great provincial centres are considered capable of doing so. The\r\nEnglish Government does not interfere with the municipal affairs of\r\nLondon on the plea that it is the capital, with those of Manchester on\r\nthe plea that it has inaugurated a policy of its own, any more than it\r\ninterferes with those of Liverpool, Leeds, or Bristol. Your\r\nlord-lieutenants of counties are virtually decorative officials,\r\nsomething different from our prefects and our sub-prefects, and your\r\nHome Secretary has not a hundredth part of the power of our Minister of\r\nthe Interior. We wish to go a step further than you, without, however,\r\nshirking the financial obligations imposed by a federation. What you\r\nwould call imperial taxes, we are willing to pay in kind as well as\r\nmoney. This is one of the things we do want; what we do not want is the\r\nresuscitation of the Empire. I am not speaking at random when I tell\r\nyou that there are rumours about traitors in our camp, and that,\r\naccording to these rumours, the struggle against the Versaillese troops\r\nwould be a mere pretext to sweep the deck for the unopposed entry of an\r\nimperial army into Paris. Whence would that army be recruited? From\r\namong the prisoners going to leave Germany, who have been worked all the\r\nwhile in the interest of the Napoleonic dynasty. After all, we have as\r\nmuch right to overthrow the Government of Versailles as the Government\r\nof Versailles had the right to upset the Empire. Their powers are by no\r\nmeans more valid by virtue of the recent elections, than was the power\r\nof Louis-Napoléon by virtue of the plébiscite of 1870. Does M. Thiers\r\nreally think that he is a better or greater man than Abraham Lincoln,\r\nwho treated the Southerns as belligerents, not as insurgents?\"\r\n\r\nSo far Cluseret. I am not prepared to say that he was a strictly\r\nhonourable man, but he was a very intelligent one, probably the most\r\nintelligent among the leaders of the Commune. At any rate, his\r\nconversation made me anxious to get a nearer sight of some of the\r\nlatter, and, as they had evidently made the Brasserie Saint-Séverin\r\ntheir principal resort of an evening, I returned thither several times.\r\n\r\nA few nights afterwards, I was just in time to witness the arrival of\r\nRaoul Rigault, on horseback, accompanied by a staff running by the side\r\nof his animal. The whole reminded me irresistibly of Decamp's picture,\r\n\"La Patrouille Turque.\" The Prefect of Police was scarcely less\r\nmagnificently attired than the rest of his fellow-dignitaries. His\r\nuniform, if I remember rightly, was blue with red facings, but it is\r\nimpossible to say, because it was covered everywhere with gold lace. His\r\nmyrmidons hustled the crowd in order to make room for their chief, and\r\nsome one laughed: \"Mais il n'y a rien de changé; c'est absolument comme\r\nsous l'Empire.\" For a moment Rigault sat quite still, surveying the\r\ncrowd and ogling the women through his double eye-glasses. Then he\r\nalighted, and caught sight of my friend and myself standing on the\r\nthreshold. \"Quels sont ces citoyens?\" he inquired, taking us in from top\r\nto toe, and stroking his long beard all the while. Some one told him our\r\nnames, at which he made a wry face, the more that mine must have been\r\nfamiliar to him, seeing that a very near relative of mine, bearing the\r\nsame, had been a special favourite with General Vinoy. He did not think\r\nfit to molest us; had he done so, it might have fared badly with us,\r\nfor by the time Lord Lyons could have interfered, we might have been\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nEver since, my friend and I have been under the impression that we owed\r\nour lives to a dark, ugly little man who, at that moment, whispered\r\nsomething to him, and who, my friend told me, immediately afterwards,\r\nwas the right hand of Raoul Rigault, Théophile Ferré. That name was also\r\nfamiliar to me, as it was to most Parisians, previous to the outbreak of\r\nthe war, because Ferré was implicated in the plot against\r\nLouis-Napoléon's life, and was tried in the early part of '70 at Blois.\r\nEvery one knew how he insulted the President, how he refused to answer,\r\nand finally exclaimed, \"Yes, I am an anarchist, a socialist, an atheist,\r\nand woe to you when our turn comes.\" He kept his word; he was a fiend,\r\nand looked one. Whenever there was anything cruel and bloodthirsty going\r\non, he made it a point to be present. He was, though ugly, not half so\r\nugly as Tridon, but one involuntarily recoiled from him.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, this very Théophile Ferré, whom I then saw for the\r\nfirst time, had been the subject of a conversation I had with Gil-Pérès,\r\nthe actor of the Palais-Royal, on the 25th or 26th of March. I had known\r\nGil-Pérès from the moment he made his mark in \"La Dame aux Camélias\" as\r\nGaudens. To my great surprise, a day or two after the proclamation of\r\nthe Commune, I heard that he had been cruelly maltreated in the Rue\r\nDrouot, that he had narrowly escaped being killed. Two days later, I\r\npaid him a visit in his lodgings at Montmartre; for he had been\r\nseverely, though not dangerously hurt, and was unable to leave his bed.\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry for your mishap,\" I said; \"but what, in Heaven's name,\r\ninduced you to meddle with politics?\"\r\n\r\nHe burst out laughing, in that peculiar laugh of his which I have never\r\nheard before or since, on or off the stage. The nearest approach to it\r\nwas that of Grassot, but the latter's was like a discharge of artillery,\r\nwhile Gil-Pérès was like that of a musketry volley.\r\n\r\n\"I did not meddle with politics,\" he replied; \"but you know how fond I\r\nam of going among crowds to study character. This day last week, I was\r\npassing along the Rue Drouot, when I saw a large group in front of the\r\nMairie. I had left home early in the morning, I knew nothing of what was\r\ngoing on in my neighbourhood, so you may imagine my surprise when I\r\nheard them calmly discussing the death of Clément Thomas and Lecomte.\r\nMy hair stood positively on end, and I must have pushed a bit in order\r\nto get nearer the speakers. I had a long black coat on, and they mistook\r\nme for a curé. I did all I could to tell them my name, but, before I\r\ncould utter a word, I was down, and they began trampling on me. Some\r\none, God alone knows who, saved me, by telling them my name. I knew\r\nnothing more, for I was brought home unconscious. And to think,\" he\r\nadded, \"that I might have been a member of the Commune myself, if I had\r\nliked.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I said, for I began to think that he was out of his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know that during the siege I tried to do my duty as a\r\nNational Guard, and in my battalion was this Théophile Ferré of whom you\r\nhave already heard. A most intelligent creature, but poor as Job and\r\nferocious to a degree. He was a study to me, and, of late, he frequently\r\ncame to see me in the morning. I generally asked him to stay to\r\nbreakfast, for I liked to hear him talk of the future Commune, though I\r\nhad not the slightest faith in his visions. I considered him a downright\r\nlunatic. About two or three days before this outbreak, he came, one\r\nmorning, looking as pale as a ghost, but evidently very much excited.\r\nBefore I had time to ask him the cause of his emotion, he exclaimed,\r\n'This time there is no mistake about it; we are the masters.' I suppose\r\nmy face must have looked a perfect blank, for he proceeded to explain.\r\n'In two days we'll hold our sittings at the Hôtel-de-Ville, and the\r\nCommune will be proclaimed. And now,' he added, 'what can I do for you,\r\ncitoyen Gil-Pérès? You have always been very kind to me, and I am not\r\nlikely to forget it when I am at the top of the tree.'\r\n\r\n\"I told him that I'd feel much obliged to him if he could induce Sardou\r\nor Dumas to write me a good part, like the latter had done before,\r\nbecause I wanted to be something more than a comic actor. But I saw that\r\nhe was getting angry.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you mean to tell me,' he almost hissed, 'that you do not want to\r\nbelong to the Commune?'\r\n\r\n\"'I haven't the slightest ambition that way,' I replied. 'People would\r\nonly make fun of me, and they would be perfectly right.'\r\n\r\n\"'Why should people make fun of you?'\r\n\r\n\"'Because, because----' I stammered.\r\n\r\n\"He left me no time to finish. 'Because you are a small man,' he said.\r\n'Well, I am a small man, too, and an ugly one into the bargain. I can\r\nassure you that the world will hear as much of me before long as if I\r\nhad been an Adonis and a Hercules.' With this he disappeared, and I have\r\nnot seen him since.\"\r\n\r\nMy purpose in reporting this conversation is to show that the Commune,\r\nwith all its evils, might have been prevented by the so-called\r\ngovernment of Versailles, if its members had been a little less eager to\r\nget their snug berths comfortably settled.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to Ferré and his companions, who, without\r\nexception, were sober to a degree, though many were probably fond of\r\ngood cheer. The English writers, often very insufficiently informed,\r\nhave generally maintained the contrary, but I know for a fact that,\r\namong the leaders of the movement, drunkenness was unknown. Ferré\r\nhimself was among the soberest of the lot: the few evenings I saw him he\r\ndrank either cold coffee or some cordial diluted with water.\r\nNevertheless, it was he who was directly responsible for the death of\r\nArchbishop Darboy, whom he could and might have saved.\r\n\r\nIn every modern tragedy there is a comic element, and in that of the\r\nCommune the comic parts were, to a certain extent, sustained by Gambon,\r\nJourde, and a few others whom it is not necessary to mention. Gambon was\r\none of the mildest of creatures, and somewhat of a \"communard malgré\r\nlui.\" He would have willingly \"left the settlement of all these vexed\r\nquestions to moral force,\" and he proposed once or twice a mission to\r\nVersailles to that effect. He was about fifty, and a fine specimen of a\r\nrobust, healthy farmer. His love of \"peaceful settlement\" arose from an\r\nexperiment he had made in that way during the Empire, though it is very\r\ndoubtful whether strictly logical reasoners would have looked upon it as\r\n\"peaceful.\" Gambon had been a magistrate and a member of the National\r\nAssembly during the Second Republic, and voted with the conservative\r\nside. The advent of the Empire made an end of his parliamentary career,\r\nand, in order to mark his disapproval of the Coup-d'État and its sequel,\r\nGambon refused to pay his taxes. The authorities seized one of his cows,\r\nand were proceeding to sell it by auction, when Gambon, accompanied by a\r\ngood many of his former constituents, appeared on the scene. \"This cow,\"\r\nhe shouts, \"has been stolen from me by the Imperial fisc, and whosoever\r\nbuys it is nothing more than a thief himself.\" Result: not a single bid\r\nfor the cow, and the auctioneer was compelled to adjourn the sale for a\r\nweek. The auctioneer deemed it prudent to transport the cow to a\r\nneighbouring commune, but Gambon had got wind of the affair, and adopted\r\nthe same expedient of moral persuasion. For nearly three months the\r\nauctioneer transported the cow from one commune to another, and Gambon\r\nfollowed him everywhere, until they reached the limits of the\r\ndepartment. Gambon apprehended that moral persuasion would have no\r\neffect among strangers, and he let things take their course. The cost of\r\nselling the cow amounted to about ten times its worth. As a matter of\r\ncourse, the whole affair was revived by \"les journaux bien pensants\" at\r\nthe advent of the Commune, and Gambon was elected a member by the 10th\r\nArrondissement. Gambon managed to escape into Switzerland; but when the\r\namnesty was proclaimed, he returned, and solicited once more the\r\nsuffrages of his former constituents. At the Brasserie Saint-Séverin,\r\nGambon was generally to be found at the ladies' table, about the\r\noccupants of which I cannot speak, seeing that I was not introduced to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nJourde was one of two \"financial delegates\" of the Commune. He had been\r\na superior employé at the Bank of France, and was considered an\r\nauthority on financial affairs. It was he to whom the Marquis de Ploeuc,\r\nthe governor of the Bank, had handed the first million for the use of\r\nthe Commune. My friend, the doctor, had known him in his former\r\ncapacity, and often invited him to our table, to which invitation the\r\n\"paymaster-general\" always eagerly responded. One evening, the\r\nconversation turned upon the events which had preceded the request for\r\nfunds. \"On the second day of the Commune,\" he said, \"the want of money\r\nbegan to be horribly felt. Eudes proposed that I should go and fetch\r\nsome from the Bank of France. To be perfectly candid, I did not care\r\nabout it. Had I been a soldier, I might have invaded the Bank at the\r\nhead of a regiment; but, to go and ask my former chief for a million or\r\nso as a matter of course, was a different thing, and I had not the moral\r\ncourage. The director of the Bank of France is very little short of a\r\ngod to his subordinates, and, in spite of our boasted 'Liberty,\r\nFraternity, and Equality,' there is no nation so ready to bow down\r\nbefore its governors as the French. Seeing that I hung back, Eudes\r\nproposed to go himself, and did, refusing to take a single soldier with\r\nhim. But he did not want the responsibility of handling the million of\r\nfrancs the governor placed at our disposal, so I was, after all, obliged\r\nto beard my former chief in his own den. He was very polite, and called\r\nme 'Monsieur le délégué aux finances,' but I would have preferred his\r\ncalling me all the names in the world, for I caught sight of a very\r\nironical smile at the corners of his mouth when, on taking leave of him,\r\nhe said, 'You may be my successor one day, Monsieur le délégué, and I\r\nhope you will profit by the lessons I have always endeavoured to teach\r\nmy subordinates: obedience to the powers that be.'\"\r\n\r\nJourde was by no means a fool or a braggart; he was a very good\r\nadministrator, and exceedingly conscientious. Like most men who have had\r\nthe constant handling of important sums of money, he was absolutely\r\nindifferent to it; and I feel certain that he did not feather his own\r\nnest during the two months he had the chance. But he vainly endeavoured\r\nto impress upon the others the necessity for economy. Every now and then\r\nhe tore his red hair and beard at the waste going on at the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville, where, in the beginning, Assi was keeping open table.\r\nNot that they were feasting, but every one who had a mind could sit\r\ndown, and, though the sum charged by the steward was moderate, two\r\nfrancs for breakfast and two francs fifty centimes for dinner, the\r\nnumber of self-invited guests increased day by day, and the\r\npaymaster-general was at his wits' end to keep pace with the expenses.\r\nThe Central-Committee put a stop to this indiscriminate hospitality by\r\nsimply arresting Assi, whom I never saw.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commune decreed the demolition of the Vendôme column, Jourde\r\nwas still more angry and in despair. He was, first of all, opposed to\r\nits destruction, from a patriotic and common-sense point of view:\r\nsecondly, he objected to the waste of money that destruction entailed;\r\nhe endeavoured to cut the Gordian knot by stopping the workmen's pay.\r\nThough three or four of his fellow \"delegates\" were absolutely of the\r\nsame opinion, the rest sent him a polite intimation that if the\r\nnecessary funds were not disbursed voluntarily they would send for them,\r\nand take the opportunity, at the same time, to \"put him against the\r\nwall,\" and make an end of him. That night, Courbet, the painter, who had\r\nbeen the prime mover in this work of destruction, came to the Brasserie\r\nSaint-Séverin from the Brasserie Andler, hard by, to taste the sweets of\r\nhis victory. His friend, Chaudey, of the _Siècle_, was no longer with\r\nhim. Like Mgr. Darboy, the Abbés Lagarde, Crozés, and Deguerry, he had\r\nbeen arrested by Raoul Rigault as a hostage, in virtue of a decree by\r\nthe Commune, setting forth that every execution of a prisoner of war,\r\ntaken by the Versaillais, would be followed by the execution of three\r\nhostages to be drawn by lot.\r\n\r\nJourde did not wear a uniform; at any rate, I never saw him in one. I\r\nhappened to remark upon it one evening, and he then gave me a partial\r\nexplanation why the others did wear them in so ostentatious a manner.\r\n\r\n\"It is really done to please the National Guards; they mistrust those\r\nwho remain 'in mufti;' they attribute their reluctance to don the\r\nuniform to the fear of being compromised, to the wish to escape\r\nunnoticed if things should go wrong. I grant you that all this does not\r\nwarrant the uniforms most of my colleagues do wear, but to the Latin\r\nraces the wisdom of Solomon lies in his magnificence, and they trace the\r\nelevation of Joseph to its primary cause--his coat of many colours. I am\r\nnot only 'delegate of finances' and paymaster-general, but head cook and\r\nbottle-washer in all that concerns monetary matters to the\r\nCentral-Committee. I have very few clerks to assist me in my work, and\r\nfewer still upon whose honesty I can depend; consequently, I am\r\ncompelled to do a good deal of drudgery myself. Yesterday I received the\r\nfortnightly accounts of Godillot,[91] the military tailors and\r\naccoutrement manufacturers. They seemed to me simply monstrous, not so\r\nmuch in respect of the prices charged for each uniform, as in respect of\r\nthe number of uniforms supplied. To have sent one of my clerks would\r\nhave been of no earthly use; there is an old Normand saying about\r\nsending the cat to Rome and his coming back mewing; the clerk would have\r\nsimply come back mewing, saying that there was no mistake, so I went\r\nmyself. I saw the chief manager.\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 91: The word \"Godillot\" has passed into the French\r\n         language, and, at present, means the soldier's shoes.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\"'I am positive there is no mistake, monsieur,' he said, 'though I may\r\ntell you at once that I made the same remark when I passed the accounts;\r\nthe number of uniforms seemed to me inordinately large; mais il faut se\r\nrendre à l'évidence, and I ticketed off every item by its corresponding\r\nvoucher. Still I felt that there is a terrible waste somewhere, and said\r\nso to the head of the retail department. \"If you will remain downstairs\r\nfor one hour,\" was the answer, \"you will have the explanation.\" I can\r\nonly say the same to you, Monsieur le délégué.'\r\n\r\n\"I did remain on that ground-floor for one hour,\" Jourde went on, \"and,\r\nduring that time, no fewer than eight young fellows came in with\r\nvouchers for complete uniforms of lieutenants or captains of the staff.\r\nMost of them looked to me as if they had never handled a sword or rifle\r\nin their lives--yardsticks seemed more in their line; and the airs they\r\ngave themselves positively disgusted me; but I do not want another\r\nreminder of the Central-Committee about my cheeseparing, so I'll let\r\nthings take their course. Look, here is a sample of how we deck\r\nourselves out quand nous allons en guerre.\"\r\n\r\nI looked in the direction pointed out to me, and beheld a somewhat dark\r\nindividual with lank, black hair, of ordinary height, or a little below\r\nperhaps, dressed in a most extraordinary costume. He wore a blue Zouave\r\njacket, large baggy crimson breeches tucked into a pair of quasi-hessian\r\nboots, a crimson sash, and a black sombrero hat with a red feather. A\r\nlong cavalry sabre completed the costume. Upon the whole, he carried\r\nhimself well, though there was a kind of swashbuckler air about him\r\nwhich smacked of the stage. I was not mistaken; the scent or the smell\r\nof the footlights was over it all.\r\n\r\n\"This is Colonel Maxime Lisbonne, an actor by profession, who has taken\r\nto soldiering with a vengeance,\" said Jourde. \"There is no doubt about\r\nhis bravery, but he is as fit to be a colonel as I am to be a general.\r\nIt does not seem to strike my colleagues that, in no matter what\r\nprofession, one has to serve an apprenticeship, and, most of all, in the\r\nscience of soldiering; Maxime Lisbonne said he would be a colonel, so\r\nthey, without more ado, made him one.[92] He never moves without that\r\nTurco at his heels.\"\r\n\r\n         [Footnote 92: During my stay in Paris, 1881-86, as the\r\n         correspondent of a London evening paper, I had occasion to see\r\n         a great deal of M. Maxime Lisbonne, who is a prominent figure\r\n         at nearly every social function, such as premières, the\r\n         unveiling of monuments, the opening of public buildings, etc.\r\n         The reason of this prominence has never been very clear to me,\r\n         unless it be on the assumption that the Paris journalists, even\r\n         the foremost of whom he treats on the footing of equality,\r\n         consider him \"good copy.\" Only as late as a few years ago, he\r\n         made a considerable sensation in the Paris press by appearing\r\n         at one of M. Carnot's receptions in evening dress, redolent of\r\n         benzine, \"because the dress had been lying _perdu_ for so many\r\n         years.\" It was he who started the famous \"taverne du bagne,\" on\r\n         the Boulevard Rochechouart, to which \"all Paris\" flocked.\r\n         Previous to this, he had been the lessee of the Bouffes du\r\n         Nord, at which theatre he brought out Louise Michel's \"Nadine.\"\r\n         Though by no means an educated man, he can, on occasions,\r\n         behave himself very well, and truth compels me to state that he\r\n         is very good-natured and obliging. One day, on the occasion of\r\n         an important murder trial, I failed to see Commandant Lunel at\r\n         the Palais de Justice, and was turning away disconsolately,\r\n         when, at a sign from M. Lisbonne, the sergeant of the Gardes de\r\n         Paris, who had refused to admit me on the presentation of my\r\n         card, relented. That same afternoon, at the mere expression of\r\n         his wish, the manager of the Jardin de Paris, which had just\r\n         been opened, presented me with a season ticket, or, to speak\r\n         correctly, placed my name on the permanent free list. In short,\r\n         I could mention a score of instances of a similar nature; all\r\n         tending to show that M. Maxime Lisbonne's \"participation in the\r\n         events of the Commune\" has had the effect of investing him with\r\n         a kind of social halo.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I saw the famous General Dombrowski, and the no less\r\nfamous Colonel or General la Cécilia. I only exchanged a few words with\r\nthe former, but I sat talking for a whole evening to the latter. He was\r\na short, spare, fidgety man, strongly pitted with small-pox, with a few\r\nstraggling hairs on the upper lip and chin. He was terribly\r\nnear-sighted, and wore a pair of thick spectacles. Nervous and restless\r\nto a degree, but a voice of remarkable sweetness. His English was\r\nfaultless, with scarcely any accent, and I was told that he spoke every\r\nEuropean language and several Oriental ones with the same accuracy. He\r\nwas the only Frenchman who could converse with Dombrowski and the other\r\nPoles in their native language. He was a clever mathematician, and, that\r\nevening, he endeavoured to prove mathematically that Von Moltke had\r\ncommitted several blunders, both at Sadowa and Sedan. \"That kind of\r\nthing,\" said Jourde, after he was gone, \"was sure to 'fetch' the\r\nCentral-Committee; he always reminds me of the doctors in Molière trying\r\nto prove that one of their confrères had cured a patient contrary to the\r\nprinciples of medicine. Mind, do not imagine that La Cécilia is not a\r\ngood soldier. He got all his grades in the Italian army, on the\r\nbattle-fields of '59-'60, and, during the late war, he directed the\r\nbrilliant defence of Alençon. But between a good soldier and a great\r\ngeneral there is a vast difference.\"\r\n\r\nPhysically, Dombrowski was almost the counterpart of La Cécilia, with\r\nthe exception of the glasses and the small-pox. But while the\r\nFrenchman--for Cécilia was a Frenchman notwithstanding his Italian\r\nname--was modest though critical, the Pole was a braggart, though by no\r\nmeans devoid of courage. Up to the very end, he sent in reports of his\r\nvictories, all of which were purely imaginary. Even as late as the 21st\r\nof May, when the Versailles troops were carrying everything before them,\r\nthe newspaper-boys were shouting, \"Brilliant victory of General\r\nDombrowski.\" Dombrowski had been invested with his high command under\r\nthe pretext that he had fought under Garibaldi and in the Polish\r\nstruggle against Russia. It transpired afterwards that he had never seen\r\nGaribaldi nor Garibaldi him, and that, so far from having aided his own\r\ncountrymen, he had been a simple private in the Russian army. Still, he\r\nwas a better man than his countryman Wrobleski, who showed his courage\r\nby going to bed while the Versaillais were shelling Vanves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong my papers I find a torn programme of a concert at the Tuileries\r\nduring the Commune. It reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n  COMMUNE DE PARIS,\r\n\r\n  PALAIS DES TUILERIES\r\n\r\n  Servant pour LA PREMIÈRE FOIS à une oeuvre patriotique\r\n\r\n  GRAND CONCERT\r\n\r\n  Au Profit des Veuves et Orphelins de la République.\r\n  ----\r\n  _Sous le Patronage de la Commune et du Citoyen Dr. Rousselle._\r\n  ----\r\n  Tout porteur de billet pris à l'avance pourra sans rétribution, visiter\r\n  le Palais des Tuileries.\r\n\r\nThe rest is missing, but I remember that among the artists who gave\r\ntheir services were Mesdames Agar and Bordas; MM. Coquelin cadet, and\r\nFrancis Thomé, the pianist.\r\n\r\nI did not take my ticket beforehand, consequently was not entitled to a\r\nstroll through the Palace previous to the concert. When I entered the\r\nSalle des Maréchaux, where the concert was to take place, I felt\r\nthankful that the trial had been spared to me, and I mentally ejaculated\r\na wish that I might never see that glorious apartment under similar\r\ncircumstances. The traces of neglect were too painful to behold, though\r\nI am bound to say that I could detect no proofs of wilful damage. My\r\nwish was gratified with a vengeance. A little more than a month\r\nafterwards, the building was in flames, and, at the hour I write, it is\r\nbeing razed to the ground.\r\n\r\nI did not stay long; I heard Madame Agar, dressed in deep mourning,\r\ndeclaim \"the Marseillaise,\" and M. Thomé execute a fantasia on\r\nwell-known operatic airs. Some of the reserved seats were occupied by\r\nthe minor dignitaries of the Commune, but the greater part of the place\r\nwas filled by working men and their spouses and the very _petite\r\nbourgeoisie_. The latter seemed to be in doubt whether to enjoy\r\nthemselves or not; but the former were very vociferous, and had\r\nevidently made up their minds that the Commune was the best of all\r\npossible régimes, seeing that it enabled them to listen to a concert in\r\na palace for a mere trifle. \"That's equality, as I understand it,\r\nmonsieur,\" said a workman in a very clean blouse to me, at the same time\r\nmaking room for me on the seat next to him. He and his companion\r\nbeguiled the time between the first and second number on the programme\r\nby sucking barley-sugar.\r\n\r\nAbout a month later--on Wednesday, May 17th, but I will not be\r\ncertain--I was present at the first gala-performance organized by the\r\nCommune, although the Versailles troops were within gunshot of the\r\nfortifications. This time I had taken a ticket beforehand. The\r\nperformance was to take place at the Opéra-Comique, and long before the\r\nappointed hour the Boulevards and the streets adjoining the theatre were\r\ncrowded with idlers, anxious to watch the arrival of the bigwigs under\r\nwhose immediate patronage the entertainment was to be given. The papers\r\nhad been full of it for days and days beforehand; the posters on the\r\nwalls had set forth its many attractions. In accordance with traditional\r\nusage on such occasions, the programme was a miscellaneous one, and the\r\nwags did not fail to remark that the Commune ought to have struck out\r\nsomething original instead of blindly following the precedents of\r\ntyrants; but in reality the Commune had no choice. Few of the principal\r\nartists of the subsidized theatres were available, and there was an\r\nevident reluctance to co-operate among some of those who were; hence it\r\nwas decided to give fragments of such operas or comedies, calculated to\r\nstimulate still further the patriotic and republican sentiments with\r\nwhich the majority of the spectators were credited. There had been less\r\ndifficulty in recruiting the orchestra, and a very fair band was got\r\ntogether. A great many invitations had been issued; few of the seats,\r\nespecially in the better parts, were paid for.\r\n\r\nAll the entrances had been thrown open, and around every one there was a\r\nconsiderable gathering, almost exclusively composed of National Guards\r\nin uniform, and women of the working classes, who enthusiastically\r\ncheered each known personage on his arrival. The latter were too\r\nmagnificent for words, the clanking sabres, resplendent uniforms, and\r\nwaving plumes only paled in contrast with the toilettes of their female\r\ncompanions who hung proudly on their arms. For them, at any rate, \"le\r\njour de gloire était arrivé.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd, especially the fairer portion of it, was decidedly\r\nenthusiastic, perhaps somewhat too enthusiastic, in their ultra-cordial\r\ngreetings and recognition of the ladies, so suddenly promoted in the\r\nsocial scale. Mélanie and Clarisse would have been satisfied with a less\r\nliteral interpretation of \"Auld Lang Syne,\" as they stepped out of the\r\ncarriages, the horses of which belied the boast that at the end of the\r\nsiege there were 30,000 serviceable animals of that kind left.\r\n\r\nThe performance had been timed for half-past seven; at half-past eight,\r\nthe principal box set apart for the chiefs of the new régime was still\r\nempty. As I have already said, disquieting rumours had been afloat for\r\nthe last few days with regard to the approach of the Versailles troops,\r\nthe guns had been thundering all day long, and, what was worse, for the\r\nlast forty-eight hours no \"startling victory\" had been announced either\r\non the walls of Paris or in the papers. Some of the \"great men,\" among\r\nthe audience in the stalls and dress-circle, and easily to be\r\ndistinguished from the ruck of ordinary mortals, professed themselves\r\nunable to supply authentic information, but as the performance had not\r\nbeen countermanded, they suggested that things were not so bad as they\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\nThe theatre was crammed from floor to ceiling, and the din was something\r\nterrible. The heat was oppressive; luckily the gas was burning low\r\nbecause the companies were as yet unable to provide a full supply. There\r\nwere few people out of uniform in either stalls or dress-circle, but the\r\nupper parts were occupied by blouses with a fair sprinkling of cloth\r\ncoats. The women seemed to me to make the most infernal noise. The two\r\nstage-boxes were still empty; in the others there were a good many\r\njournalists and ladies who had come to criticize the appearance and\r\ndemeanour of the \"dames de nos nouveaux gouvernants.\" There was one box\r\nwhich attracted particular attention; one of its occupants, evidently a\r\n\"dame du monde,\" was in evening dress, wearing some magnificent\r\ndiamonds, while it was very patent that those of her own social status\r\nhad made it a point to dress as simply as possible. I have never been\r\nable to find out the name of the lady; I had not seen her before, I have\r\nnot seen her since.\r\n\r\nAt about a quarter to nine the doors of the stage-boxes were flung back,\r\nand the guests of the evening appeared. But alas, they were not the\r\nchief members of the Commune, only the secondary characters. It is\r\ndoubtful, though, whether the former could have been more magnificently\r\nattired than were the latter. Their uniforms were positively hidden\r\nbeneath the gold lace.\r\n\r\nImmediately, the band struck up the inevitable \"Marseillaise;\" the\r\nspectators in the upper galleries joined in the chorus; the building\r\nshook to its foundations, and, amidst the terrible din, one could\r\ndistinctly hear the crowds on the Boulevards re-echoing the strains. The\r\noccupants of the state boxes gave the signal for the applause, then the\r\ncurtain rose, and Mdlle. Agar, in peplos and cothurnus, recited the\r\nstrophes once more. When the curtain fell, the audience rushed to the\r\nfoyer or out into the open air; at any rate, the former was not\r\ninconveniently crowded. Among those strolling up and down I noticed the\r\nlady of the diamonds, on the arm of a rather common-looking individual\r\nin a gorgeous uniform. I believe I caught sight of the American\r\nMinister, but I will not be certain.\r\n\r\nThis time the curtain rose upon an act of a comedy; the spectators,\r\nhowever, did not seem to be vastly interested; they were evidently\r\nwaiting for the duo to be sung by Madame Ugalde and a tenor whose name I\r\ndo not remember. He was, I heard, an amateur of great promise.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Madame Ugalde uttered her first notes, when a bugler of the\r\nfranc-tireurs of the Commune stepped in front of an empty box and\r\nsounded the charge. The effect was startling. The audience rose to a\r\nman, and rushed to the exits. In less than five minutes the building was\r\nempty. I had let the human avalanche pass by. When I came outside I was\r\ntold that it was a false alarm, or, rather, a practical joke; but no\r\none re-entered the theatre. Thus ended the gala-performance of the\r\nCommune, and a careful observer would have had no difficulty in\r\nforeseeing the end of the latter. The bugler had, unconsciously perhaps,\r\nsounded its death-knell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. APPLETON & CO.'S PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Christopher Columbus.]\r\n\r\n_THE STORY OF COLUMBUS._\r\n\r\nBy ELIZABETH EGGLESTON SEELYE; edited by Dr. EDWARD EGGLESTON. With 100\r\nIllustrations by Allegra Eggleston. 12mo. Cloth, $1.75.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Caravel.]\r\n\r\nThis book is the result of most extensive investigations, which have\r\nbeen carefully verified by the eminent historian and novelist, Dr.\r\nEggleston. It is not too much to say that the whole world has been drawn\r\nupon for material by the author and the artist. The fruits of these\r\ninvestigations are presented in a popular, readable, always entertaining\r\nform. While the book contains all the results of modern inquiry offered\r\nin the bulkiest biographies, the story is here condensed and the\r\nmaterial selected with a view to an always interesting narrative. To a\r\nconsiderable extent the plan of both text and illustrations is like that\r\nof Eggleston's \"Household History of the United States.\" It is hardly\r\nnecessary to say more regarding the fitness of this volume for a place\r\nin every American private, public, and school library.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Catapult.]\r\n\r\n     \"The purpose of the writer of this book has been to relate the\r\n     life of the greatest of discoverers in a manner interesting and\r\n     delightful to the general reader, while producing a narrative\r\n     strictly conformed to the facts as given by the best ancient\r\n     authorities and developed by the latest researches of scholars.\r\n     There is here no attempt to discuss the _pros_ and _cons_ of\r\n     debated points in Columbian history. Such investigators as\r\n     Navarrete, Mr. Harrisse, Signor Staglieno, and our own learned\r\n     Mr. Justin Winsor, have wrought abundantly and with large results\r\n     upon these problems. It is the purpose of the present work to\r\n     tell the story as understood through the labors of these\r\n     scholars, leaving aside ponderous discussions which in a book\r\n     intended for general reading would tire without enlightening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Image found at Santo Domingo.]\r\n\r\n     \"Though disclaiming original investigation beyond the careful use\r\n     of the leading authorities, Mrs. Seelye has been at much pains\r\n     not to give the reader the discredited myths used by the old\r\n     school of biographers. It is a poor service to relate as history\r\n     an interesting story that is not true, or to lift an historical\r\n     figure into a heroism far from his real character. To give the\r\n     facts as we know them, and to show Columbus as he really was, has\r\n     been the sincere endeavor of the writer of this book. The story\r\n     is wonderful enough without the embellishment of fiction; the man\r\n     is interesting enough when painted in his real colors.\"--_From\r\n     the Introduction, by Edward Eggleston._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brer Rabbit Preaches.]\r\n\r\n_ON THE PLANTATION._\r\n\r\nBy JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS, author of \"Uncle Remus.\" With 23 Illustrations\r\nby E. W. KEMBLE, and Portrait of the Author. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most personal and in some respects the most important work which Mr.\r\nHarris has published since \"Uncle Remus.\" Many will read between the\r\nlines and see the autobiography of the author. In addition to the\r\nstirring incidents which appear in the story, the author presents a\r\ngraphic picture of certain phases of Southern life which have not\r\nappeared in his books before. There are also new examples of the\r\nfolk-lore of the negroes, which became classic when presented to the\r\npublic in the pages of \"Uncle Remus.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The book is in the characteristic vein which has made the author\r\n     so famous and popular as an interpreter of plantation\r\n     character.\"--_Rochester Union and Advertiser._\r\n\r\n     \"Those who never tire of Uncle Remus and his stories--with whom\r\n     we would be accounted--will delight in Joe Maxwell and his\r\n     exploits.\"--_London Saturday Review._\r\n\r\n     \"Altogether a most charming book.\"--_Chicago Times._\r\n\r\n     \"Really a valuable, if modest, contribution to the history of the\r\n     civil war within the Confederate lines, particularly on the eve\r\n     of the catastrophe. While Mr. Harris, in his preface, professes\r\n     to have lost the power to distinguish between what is true and\r\n     what is imaginative in his episodical narrative, the reader\r\n     readily finds the clew. Two or three new animal fables are\r\n     introduced with effect; but the history of the plantation, the\r\n     printing-office, the black runaways, and white deserters, of whom\r\n     the impending break-up made the community tolerant, the coon and\r\n     fox hunting, forms the serious purpose of the book, and holds the\r\n     reader's interest from beginning to end. Like 'Daddy Jake,' this\r\n     is a good anti-slavery tract in disguise, and does credit to Mr.\r\n     Harris's humanity. There are amusing illustrations by E. W.\r\n     Kemble.\"--_New York Evening Post._\r\n\r\n     \"A charming little book, tastefully gotten up.... Its simplicity,\r\n     humor, and individuality would be very welcome to any one who was\r\n     weary of the pretentiousness and the dull obviousness of the\r\n     average three-volume novel.\"--_London Chronicle._\r\n\r\n     \"The mirage of war vanishes and reappears like an ominous shadow\r\n     on the horizon, but the stay-at-home whites of the Southern\r\n     Confederacy were likewise threatened by fears of a servile\r\n     insurrection. This dark dread exerts its influence on a narration\r\n     which is otherwise cheery with boyhood's fortunate freedom from\r\n     anxiety, and sublime disregard for what the morrow may bring\r\n     forth. The simple chronicle of old times 'on the plantation'\r\n     concludes all too soon; the fire burns low and the tale is ended\r\n     just as the reader becomes acclimated to the mid-Georgian\r\n     village, and feels thoroughly at home with Joe and Mink. The 'Owl\r\n     and the Birds,' 'Old Zip Coon,' the 'Big Injun and the Buzzard,'\r\n     are joyous echoes of the plantation-lore that first delighted us\r\n     in 'Uncle Remus.' Kemble's illustrations, evidently studied from\r\n     life, are interspersed in these pages of a book of consummate\r\n     charm.\"--_Philadelphia Ledger._\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York: D.
