A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\n     \"A thousand years ago, by the rim of a tiny spring, a monk who had\r\n     avowed himself to the cult of Saint Saturnin, robed, cowled and\r\n     sandalled, knelt down to say a prayer to his beloved patron saint.\r\n     Again he came, this time followed by more of his kind, and a wooden\r\n     cross was planted by the side of the \"Fontaine Belle Eau,\" by this\r\n     time become a place of pious pilgrimage. After the monk came a\r\n     king, the latter to hunt in the neighbouring forest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was this old account of fact, or legend, that led the author and\r\nillustrator of this book to a full realization of the wealth of historic\r\nand romantic incidents connected with the French royal parks and\r\npalaces, incidents which the makers of guidebooks have passed over in\r\nfavour of the, presumably, more important, well authenticated facts of\r\nhistory which are often the bare recitals of political rises and falls\r\nand dull chronologies of building up and tearing down.\r\n\r\nMuch of the history of France was made in the great national forests and\r\nthe royal country-houses of the kingdom, but usually it has been only\r\nthe events of the capital which have been passed in review. To a great\r\nextent this history was of the gallant, daring kind, often written in\r\nblood, the sword replacing the pen.\r\n\r\nAt times gayety reigned supreme, and at times it was sadness; but always\r\nthe pageant was imposing.\r\n\r\nThe day of pageants has passed, the day when lords and ladies moved\r\nthrough stately halls, when royal equipages hunted deer or boar on royal\r\npreserves, when gay cavalcades of solemn corteges thronged the great\r\nFrench highways to the uttermost frontiers and ofttimes beyond. Those\r\ndays have passed; but, to one who knows the real France, a ready-made\r\nsetting is ever at hand if he would depart a little from the beaten\r\npaths worn smooth by railway and automobile tourists who follow only the\r\nlines of conventional travel.\r\n\r\nFrance, even to-day, the city and the country alike, is the paradise of\r\nEuropean monarchs on a holiday. One may be met at Biarritz on the shores\r\nof the Gascon gulf; another may be taking the waters at Aix or Vichy,\r\nshooting pigeons under the shadow of the Tete de Chien, or hunting at\r\nRambouillet. This is modern France, the most cosmopolitan meeting place\r\nand playground of royalty in the world.\r\n\r\nFrench royal parks and palaces, those of the kings and queens of\r\nmediaeval, as well as later, times, differ greatly from those of other\r\nlands. This is perhaps not so much in their degree of splendour and\r\nluxury as in the sentiment which attaches itself to them. In France\r\nthere has ever been a spirit of gayety and spontaneity unknown\r\nelsewhere. It was this which inspired the construction and maintenance\r\nof such magnificent royal residences as the palaces of Saint\r\nGermain-en-Laye, Fontainebleau, Versailles, Compiegne, Rambouillet,\r\netc., quite different from the motives which caused the erection of the\r\nLouvre, the Tuileries or the Palais Cardinal at Paris.\r\n\r\nNowhere else does there exist the equal of these inspired royal\r\ncountry-houses of France, and, when it comes to a consideration of their\r\nsurrounding parks and gardens, or those royal hunting preserves in the\r\nvicinity of the Ile de France, or of those still further afield, at\r\nRambouillet or in the Loire country, their superiority to similar\r\ndomains beyond the frontiers is even more marked.\r\n\r\nIn plan this book is a series of itineraries, at least the chapters are\r\narranged, to a great extent in a topographical sequence; and, if the\r\nscope is not as wide as all France, it is because of the prominence\r\nalready given to the parks and palaces of Touraine and elsewhere in the\r\nold French provinces in other works in which the artist and author have\r\ncollaborated. It is for this reason that so little consideration has\r\nbeen given to Chambord, Amboise or Chenonceaux, which were as truly\r\nroyal as any of that magnificent group of suburban Paris palaces which\r\nbegins with Conflans and ends with Marly and Versailles.\r\n\r\nGoing still further afield, there is in the Pyrenees that chateau, royal\r\nfrom all points of view, in which was born the gallant Henri of France\r\nand Navarre, but a consideration of that, too, has already been included\r\nin another volume.\r\n\r\nThe present survey includes the royal dwellings of the capital, those of\r\nthe faubourgs and the outlying districts far enough from town to be\r\nrecognized as in the country, and still others as remote as Rambouillet,\r\nChantilly and Compiegne. All, however, were intimately connected with\r\nthe life of the capital in the mediaeval and Renaissance days, and\r\ntogether form a class distinct from any other monumental edifices which\r\nexist, or ever have existed, in France.\r\n\r\nMere historic fact has been subordinated as far as possible to a recital\r\nof such picturesque incidents of the life of contemporary times as the\r\nold writers have handed down to us, and a complete chronological review\r\nhas in no manner been attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER                                                 PAGE\r\n\r\n       I.

Historical\r\nmaterial as identified with the life of some great architectural glory\r\nis something more than a mere repetition of chronologies; the sidelights\r\nand the co-related incidents, though indeed many of them may be but\r\nhearsay, are quite as interesting, quite as necessary, in fact, for the\r\nproper appreciation of a famous palace or chateau as long columns of\r\ndates, or an evolved genealogical tree which attempts to make plain that\r\nwhich could be better left unexplained. The glamour of history would be\r\nconsiderably dimmed if everything was explained, and a very seamy block\r\nof marble may be chiselled into a very acceptable statue if the workman\r\nbut knows how to avoid the doubtful parts.\r\n\r\nAn itinerary that follows not only the ridges, but occasionally plunges\r\ndown into the hollows and turns up or down such crossroads as may have\r\nchanced to look inviting, is perhaps more interesting than one laid out\r\non conventional lines. A shadowy something, which for a better name may\r\nbe called sentiment, if given full play encourages these side-steps, and\r\nsince they are generally found fruitful, and often not too fatiguing,\r\nthe procedure should be given every encouragement.\r\n\r\nNot all the interesting royal palaces and chateaux of France are those\r\nwith the best known names. Not all front on Paris streets and quays, no\r\nmore than the best glimpses of ancient or modern France are to be had\r\nfrom the benches of a sight-seeing automobile.\r\n\r\nVersailles, and even Fontainebleau, are too frequently considered as but\r\nthe end of a half-day pilgrimage for the tripper. It were better that\r\none should approach them more slowly, and by easy stages, and leave them\r\nless hurriedly. As for those architectural monuments of kings, which\r\nwere tuned in a minor key, they, at all events, need to be hunted down\r\non the spot, the enthusiast being forearmed with such scraps of historic\r\nfact as he can gather beforehand, otherwise he will see nothing at\r\nConflans, Marly or Bourg-la-Reine which will suggest that royalty ever\r\nhad the slightest concern therewith.\r\n\r\nDealing first with Paris it is evident it is there that the pilgrim to\r\nFrench shrines must make his most profound obeisance. This applies as\r\nwell to palaces as to churches. In all cases one goes back into the past\r\nto make a start, and old Paris, what there is left of it, is still old\r\nParis, though one has to leave the grand boulevards to find this out.\r\n\r\nColberts and Haussmanns do not live to-day, or if they do they have\r\nbecome so \"practical\" that a drainage canal or an overhead or\r\nunderground railway is more of a civic improvement than the laying out\r\nof a public park, like the gardens of the Tuileries, or the building and\r\nembellishment of a public edifice--at least with due regard for the best\r\ntraditions. When the monarchs of old called in men of taste and culture\r\ninstead of \"business men\" they builded in the most agreeable fashion. We\r\nhave not improved things with our \"systems\" and our committees of\r\n\"_hommes d'affaires_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion to-day to decry the cavaliers and the wearers of\r\n\"love-locks,\" but they had a pretty taste in art and an eye for artistic\r\nsurroundings, those old fellows of the sword and cloak; a much more\r\npretty taste than their descendants, the steam-heat and running-water\r\npartisans of to-day. Louis XV and Empire drawing and dining-rooms are\r\neverywhere advertised as the attractions of the great palace hotels, and\r\nsome of them are very good copies of their predecessors, though one\r\ncannot help but feel that the clientele as a whole is more insistent on\r\ntelephones in the bedrooms and auto-taxis always on tap than with regard\r\nto the sentiment of good taste and good cheer which is to be evoked by\r\neating even a hurried meal in a room which reproduces some historically\r\nfamous Salle des Gardes or the Chambre of the OEil de Boeuf of the\r\nLouvre, if, indeed, most of the hungry folk know what their surroundings\r\nare supposed to represent.\r\n\r\nAny chronicle which attempts to set down a record of the comings and\r\ngoings of French monarchs is saved from being a mere dull chronology of\r\ndates and resume of facts by its obligatory references to the architects\r\nand builders who made possible the splendid settings amid which these\r\npicturesque rulers passed their lives.\r\n\r\nThe castle builders of France, the garden designers, the architects,\r\ndecorators and craftsmen of all ranks produced not a medley, but a\r\ncoherent, cohesive whole, which stands apart from, and far ahead of,\r\nmost of the contemporary work of its kind in other lands. Castles and\r\nkeeps were of one sort in England and Scotland, of still another along\r\nthe Rhine, and if the Renaissance palaces and chateaux first came into\r\nbeing in Italy it is certain they never grew to the flowering luxuriance\r\nthere that they did in France.\r\n\r\nThus does France establish itself as leader in new movements once again.\r\nIt was so in the olden time with the arts of the architect, the\r\nlandscape gardener and the painter; it is so to-day with respect to such\r\nmundane, less sentimental things as automobiles and aeroplanes.\r\n\r\nAnother chapter, in a story long since started, is a repetition, or\r\nreview, of the outdoor life of the French monarchs and their followers.\r\nNot only did Frenchmen of Gothic and Renaissance times have a taste for\r\ntravelling far afield, pursuing the arts of peace or war as their\r\nconscience or conditions dictated; but they loved, too, the open country\r\nand the open road at home; they loved also _la chasse_, as they did\r\ntournaments, _fetes-champetres_ and outdoor spectacles of all kinds. Add\r\nthese stage settings to the splendid costuming and the flamboyant\r\narchitectural accessories of Renaissance times in France and we have\r\nwhat is assuredly not to be found in other lands, a spectacular and\r\nimposing pageant of mediaeval and Renaissance life and manners which is\r\nsuperlative from all points of view.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps hard, sometimes, to reconcile with the French attitude\r\ntowards outdoor life to-day, when _la chasse_ means the hunting of tame\r\nfoxes (a sport which has been imported from across the channel),\r\n\"_sport_\" means a prize fight, and a garden party or a _fete-champetre_\r\na mere gossiping rendezvous over a cup of badly made tea. In the France\r\nof the olden time they did things differently--and better.\r\n\r\nNot all French history was made, or written, within palace walls; much\r\nof it came into being in the open air, like the two famous meetings by\r\nthe Bidassoa, Napoleon's first sight of Marie Louise on the highroad\r\nleading out from Senlis, or his making the Pope a prisoner at the Croix\r\nde Saint Heram, in the Forest of Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nIt is this change of scene that makes French history so appealing to\r\nthose who might otherwise let it remain in shut-up and dry-as-dust books\r\non library shelves.\r\n\r\nThe French monarchs of old were indeed great travellers, and it is by\r\nvirtue of the fact that affairs of state were often promulgated and\r\nconsummated _en voyage_ that a royal stamp came to be acquired by many a\r\nchateau or country-house which to-day would hardly otherwise be\r\nconsidered as of royal rank.\r\n\r\nThroughout France, notably in the neighbourhood of Paris, are certain\r\nchateaux--palaces only by lack of name--of the nobility where royalties\r\nwere often as much at home as under their own royal standards. One\r\ncannot attempt to confine the limits where these chateaux are to be\r\nfound, for they actually covered the length and breadth of France.\r\n\r\nJourneying afield in those romantic times was probably as comfortably\r\naccomplished, by monarchs at least, as it is to-day. What was lacking\r\nwas speed, but they lodged at night under roofs as hospitable as those\r\nof the white and gold caravanserai (and some more humble) which perforce\r\ncome to be temporary abiding places of royalties _en tour_ to-day. The\r\nwriter has seen the Dowager Queen of Italy lunching at a neighbouring\r\ntable at a roadside _trattoria_ in Piedmont which would have no class\r\ndistinction whatever as compared with the average suburban road-house\r\nacross the Atlantic. At Biarritz, too, the automobiling monarch,\r\nAlphonse XIII, has been known to take \"tea\" on the terrace of the great\r\ntourist-peopled hotel in company with mere be-goggled commoners. _Le\r\ntemps va!_ Were monarchs so democratic in the olden time, one wonders.\r\n\r\nThe court chronicles of all ages, and all ranks, have proved a gold\r\nmine for the makers of books of all sorts and conditions. Not only court\r\nchroniclers but pamphleteers, even troubadours and players, have\r\ncontributed much to the records of the life of mediaeval France. All\r\nhistory was not made by political intrigue or presumption; a good deal\r\nof it was born of the gentler passions, and a chap-book maker would put\r\noften into print many accounts which the recorder of mere history did\r\nnot dare use. History is often enough sorry stuff when it comes to human\r\ninterest, and it needs editing only too often.\r\n\r\nCourtiers and the fashionable world of France, ever since the days of\r\nthe poetry-making and ballad-singing Francis and Marguerite, and before,\r\nfor that matter, made of literature--at least the written and spoken\r\nchronicle of some sort--a diversion and an accomplishment. Royal or\r\nofficial patronage given these mediaeval story-tellers did not always\r\nproduce the truest tales. Then, as now, writer folk were wont to\r\nexaggerate, but most of their work made interesting reading.\r\n\r\nThese courtiers of the itching pen did not often write for money. Royal\r\nfavour, or that of some fair lady, or ladies, was their chief return in\r\nmany more cases than those for which their accounts were settled by mere\r\ndross. It is in the work of such chroniclers as these that one finds a\r\nfund of unrepeated historic lore.\r\n\r\nThe dramatists came on the scene with their plots ready-made (and have\r\nbeen coming ever since, if one recalls the large number of French\r\ncostume plays of recent years), and whether they introduced errors of\r\nfact, or not, there was usually so much truth about their work that the\r\nvery historians more than once were obliged to have recourse to the\r\nproductions of their colleagues. The dramatists' early days in France,\r\nas in England, were their golden days. The mere literary man, or\r\nchronicler, was often flayed alive, but the dramatist, even though he\r\ndished up the foibles of a king, and without any dressing at that, was\r\nfeted and made as much of as a record piano player of to-day.\r\n\r\nOne hears a lot about the deathbed scribblers in England in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but there was not much of that sort\r\nof thing in France. No one here penned bitter jibes and lascivious\r\nverses merely to keep out of jail, as did Nash and Marlowe in England.\r\nIn short, one must give due credit to the court chroniclers and\r\nballad-singers of France as being something more than mere pilfering,\r\nblackmailing hacks.\r\n\r\nAll the French court and its followers in the sixteenth century shouted\r\nepigrams and affected being greater poets than they really were. It was\r\na good sign, and it left its impress on French literature. Following in\r\nthe footsteps of Francis I and the two Marguerites nobles vied with each\r\nother in their efforts to produce some epoch-making work of poesy or\r\nprose, and while they did not often publish for profit they were glad\r\nenough to see themselves in print. Then there were also the professional\r\nmen of letters, as distinct from the courtiers with literary ambitions,\r\nthe churchmen and courtly attaches of all ranks with the literary bee\r\nhumming in their bonnets. They, too, left behind them an imposing\r\nrecord, which has been very useful to others coming after who were\r\nconcerned with getting a local colour of a brand which should look\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\nIt is with such guiding lights as are suggested by the foregoing resume\r\nthat one seeks his clues for the repicturing of the circumstances under\r\nwhich French royal palaces were erected, as well as for the truthful\r\nrepetition of the ceremonies and functions of the times, for the court\r\nlife of old, whether in city palace or country chateau, was a very\r\ndifferent thing from that of the Republican regime of to-day.\r\n\r\nNot only were the royal Paris dwellings, from the earliest times, of a\r\nprofound luxuriance of design and execution, but the private hotels, the\r\npalaces, one may well say, of the nobility were of the same superlative\r\norder, and kings and queens alike did not disdain to lodge therein on\r\nsuch occasions as suited their convenience. The suggestive comparison is\r\nmade because of the close liens with which royalty and the higher\r\nnobility were bound.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to recall, among others of this class, the celebrated\r\nHotel de Beauvais which will illustrate the reference. Not only was this\r\nmagnificent town house of palatial dimensions, but it was the envy of\r\nthe monarchs themselves, because of its refined elegance of\r\nconstruction. This edifice exists to-day, in part, at No. 68 Rue\r\nFrancois Miron, and the visitor may judge for himself as to its former\r\nelegance.\r\n\r\nLoret, in his \"Gazette\" in verse, recounts a visit made to the Hotel de\r\nBeauvais in 1663 by Marie Therese, the Queen of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n   Mercredi, notre auguste Reine,\r\n   Cette charmante souveraine,\r\n   Fut chez Madame de Beauvais\r\n   Pour de son amiable palais\r\n   Voir les merveilles etonnantes\r\n   Et les raretes surprenantes.\r\n\r\nTimes have changed, for the worse or for the better. The sedan-chair and\r\nthe coach have given way to the automobile and the engine, and the wood\r\nfire to a stale calorifer, or perhaps a gas-log.\r\n\r\nThe comparisons _are_ odious; there is no question as to this; but it is\r\nby contrast that the subject is made the more interesting.\r\n\r\nFrom the old Palais des Thermes (now a part of the Musee de Cluny) of\r\nthe Roman emperors down through the Palais de la Cite (where lodged the\r\nkings of the first and second races) to the modern installations of the\r\nLouvre is a matter of twelve centuries. The record is by no means a\r\nconsecutive one, but a record exists which embraces a dozen, at least,\r\nof the Paris abodes of royalty, where indeed they lived according to\r\nmany varying scales of comfort and luxury.\r\n\r\nNot all the succeeding French monarchs had the abilities or the\r\ninclinations that enabled them to keep up to the traditions of the\r\nart-loving Francis I, but almost all of their number did something\r\ncreditable in building or decoration, or commanded it to be done.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV, though he delayed the adjustment of Europe for two centuries,\r\nwas the first real beautifier of Paris since Philippe Auguste. Privately\r\nhis taste in art and architecture was rather ridiculous, but publicly he\r\nand his architects achieved great things in the general scheme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The_ Louvre _The_ Tuileries & _The_ Palais Royal _of_\r\nTo-Day]\r\n\r\nNapoleon I, in turn, caught up with things in a political sense, in\r\ntruth he ran ahead of them, but he in no way neglected the\r\nembellishments of the capital, and added a new wing to the Louvre, and\r\nfilled Musees with stolen loot, which remorse, or popular clamour,\r\ninduced him, for the most part, to return at a later day.\r\n\r\nIn a decade Napoleon made much history, and he likewise did much for the\r\nroyal palaces of France. After him a gap supervened until the advent of\r\nNapoleon III, who, weakling that he was, had the perspicacity to give\r\nthe Baron Haussmann a chance to play his part in the making of modern\r\nParis, and if the Tuileries and Saint Cloud had not disappeared as a\r\nresult of his indiscretion the period of the Second Empire would not\r\nhave been at all discreditable, as far as the impress it left on Paris\r\nwas concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF FRENCH GARDENS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French garden was a creation of all epochs from the fifteenth to the\r\nseventeenth centuries, and, for the most part, those of to-day and of\r\nlater decades of the nineteenth century, are adaptations and\r\nrestorations of the classic accepted forms.\r\n\r\nFrom the modest _jardinet_ of the moyen-age to the ample gardens and\r\n_parterres_ of the Renaissance was a wide range. In their highest\r\nexpression these early French gardens, with their _broderies_ and\r\n_carreaux_ may well be compared as works of art with contemporary\r\nstructures in stone or wood or stuffs in woven tapestries, which latter\r\nthey greatly resembled.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XIV and Louis XV the elaborateness of the French garden was\r\neven more an accentuated epitome of the tastes of the period. Near the\r\nend of the eighteenth century a marked deterioration was noticeable and\r\na separation of the tastes which ordained the arrangement of\r\ncontemporary dwellings and their gardens was very apparent. Under the\r\nEmpire the antique style of furniture and decoration was used too, but\r\nthere was no contemporary expression with regard to garden making.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JARDIN FRANCAIS\r\n\r\nJARDIN ANGLAIS]\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the nineteenth century, under the Second Empire,\r\nthe symmetrical lines of the old-time _parterres_ came again into being,\r\nand to them were attached composite elements or motives, which more\r\nclosely resembled details of the conventional English garden than\r\nanything distinctly French.\r\n\r\nThe English garden was, for the most part, pure affectation in France,\r\nor, at best, it was treated as a frank exotic. Even to-day, in modern\r\nFrance, where an old dwelling of the period of Henri IV, Francois I,\r\nLouis XIII, Louis XIV, or Louis XV still exists with its garden, the\r\nlatter is more often than not on the classically pure French lines,\r\nwhile that of a modern cottage, villa or chateau is often a poor,\r\nvariegated thing, fantastic to distraction.\r\n\r\nTurning back the pages of history one finds that each people, each\r\ncentury, possessed its own specious variety of garden; a species which\r\nresponded sufficiently to the tastes and necessities of the people, to\r\ntheir habits and their aspirations.\r\n\r\nGarden-making, like the art of the architect, differed greatly in\r\nsucceeding centuries, and it is for this reason that the garden of the\r\nmoyen-age, of the epoch of the Crusades, for example, did not bear the\r\nleast resemblance to the more ample _parterres_ of the Renaissance.\r\nCivilization was making great progress, and it was necessary that the\r\ngardens should be in keeping with a less restrained, more luxurious\r\nmethod of life.\r\n\r\nIf the gardens of the Renaissance marked a progress over the _preaux_\r\nand _jardinets_ of mediaevalism, those of Le Notre were a blossoming\r\nforth of the Renaissance seed. Regretfully, one cannot say as much for\r\nthe garden plots of the eighteenth century, and it was only with the\r\nmid-nineteenth century that the general outlines took on a real charm\r\nand attractiveness again, and this was only achieved by going back to\r\noriginal principles.\r\n\r\nThe first gardens were the _vergers_ and _preaux_, little checker-board\r\nsquares of a painful primitiveness as compared with later standards.\r\nThese squares, or _carreaux_, were often laid out in foliage and\r\nblossoming plants as suggestive as possible of their being made of\r\ncarpeting or marble. When these miniature enclosures came to be\r\nsurrounded with trellises and walls the Renaissance in garden-making may\r\nbe considered as having been in full sway.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XIV a certain affluence was noticeable in garden plots, and\r\nwith Louis XV an even more notable symmetry was apparent in the\r\ndisposition of the general outlines. By this time, the garden in France\r\nhad become a frame which set off the architectural charms of the\r\ndwelling rather than remaining a mere accessory, but it was only with\r\nthe replacing of the castle-fortress by the more domesticated chateau\r\nthat a really generous garden space became a definite attribute of a\r\ngreat house.\r\n\r\nThe first gardens surrounding the French chateaux were developments, or\r\nadaptations, of Italian gardens, such as were designed across the Alps\r\nby Mercogliano, during the feudal period.\r\n\r\nLater, and during the time of the Crusades, the garden question hardly\r\nentered into French life. Gardens, like all other luxuries, were given\r\nlittle thought when the graver questions of peace and security were to\r\nbe considered, and, for this reason, there is little or nothing to say\r\nof French gardens previous to the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nAn important species of the gardens of the moyen-age was that which was\r\nfound as an adjunct to the great monastic institutions, the _preaux_,\r\nwhich were usually surrounded by the cloister colonnade. One of the most\r\nimportant of these, of which history makes mention, was that of the\r\nAbbaye de Saint Gall, of which Charlemagne was capitular. It was he who\r\nselected the plants and vegetables which the dwellers therein should\r\ncultivate.\r\n\r\nOf the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there is an abundant literary\r\nrecord, and, in a way, a pictorial record as well. From these one can\r\nmake a very good deduction of what the garden of that day was like;\r\nstill restrained, but yet something more than rudimentary. From now on\r\nFrench gardens were divided specifically into the _potager_ and\r\n_verger_.\r\n\r\nThe _potager_ was virtually a vegetable garden within the walls which\r\nsurrounded the seigneurial dwelling, and was of necessity of very\r\nlimited extent, chiefly laid out in tiny _carreaux_, or beds, bordered\r\nby tiles or bricks, much as a small city garden is arranged to-day. Here\r\nwere cultivated the commonest vegetables, a few flowers and a liberal\r\nassortment of herbs, such as rue, mint, parsley, sage, lavender, etc.\r\n\r\nThe _verger_, or _viridarium_, was practically a fruit garden, as it is\r\nto-day, with perhaps a generous sprinkling of flowers and aromatic\r\nplants. The _verger_ was always outside the walls, but not far from the\r\nentrance or the drawbridge crossing the moat and leading to the chateau.\r\n\r\nIt was to the _verger_, or orchard, curiously enough, that in times of\r\npeace the seigneur and his family retired after luncheon for diversion\r\nor repose.\r\n\r\n   \"D illocques vieng en cest vergier\r\n   Eascuns jour pour s'esbanoier.\"\r\n\r\nThus ran a couplet of the \"Roman de Thebes\"; and of the hundred or more\r\ntales of chivalry in verse, which are recognized as classic, nearly all\r\nmake mention of the _verger_.\r\n\r\nIt was here that young men and maidens came in springtime for the fete\r\nof flowers, when they wove chaplets and garlands, for the moyen-age had\r\npreserved the antique custom of the coiffure of flowers, that is to say\r\nhats of natural flowers, as we might call them to-day, except that\r\nmodern hats seemingly call for most of the products of the barnyard and\r\nthe farm in their decoration, as well as the flowers of the field.\r\n\r\nThe rose was queen among all these flowers and then came the lily and\r\nthe carnation, chiefly in their simple, savage state, not the highly\r\ncultivated product of to-day. From the ballads and the love songs, one\r\ngathers that there were also violets, eglantine, daisies, pansies,\r\nforget-me-nots, and the marguerite, or _consoude_, was one of the most\r\nloved of all.\r\n\r\nThe carnation, or _oeillet_, was called _armerie_; the pansy was\r\nparticularly in favour with the ladies, who embroidered it on their\r\nhandkerchiefs and their girdles. Still other flowers found a place in\r\nthis early horticultural catalogue, the marigold, gladiolus, stocks,\r\nlily-of-the-valley and buttercups.\r\n\r\nFrequently the _verger_ was surrounded by a protecting wall, of more or\r\nless architectural pretense, with towers and accessories conforming to\r\nthe style of the period, and decorative and utilitarian fountains,\r\nbenches and seats were also common accessories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Henri IV in an Old French Garden_]\r\n\r\nThe old prints, which reproduced these early French gardens, are most\r\ncurious to study, amusing even; but their point of view was often\r\ndistorted as to perspective. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,\r\nperspective was almost wholly ignored in pictorial records. There was\r\noften no scale, and no depth; everything was out of proportion with\r\neverything else, and for this reason it is difficult to judge of the\r\nexact proportions of many of these early French gardens.\r\n\r\nThe origin of garden-making in France, in the best accepted sense of the\r\nterm, properly began with the later years of the thirteenth century and\r\nthe early years of the fourteenth; continuing the tradition, remained\r\ndistinctly French until the mid-fifteenth century, for the Italian\r\ninfluence did not begin to make itself felt until after the Italian wars\r\nand travels of Charles VIII, Louis XI and Francis I.\r\n\r\nThe earliest traces of the work of the first two of these monarchs are\r\nto be seen at Blois and, for a time henceforth, it is to be presumed\r\nthat all royal gardens in France were largely conceived under the\r\ninspiration of Italian influences. Before, as there were primitives in\r\nthe art of painting in France, there were certainly French gardeners in\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. One of these, whoever he may\r\nhave been, was the designer of the _preaux_ and the _treilles_ of the\r\nLouvre of Charles V, of which a pictorial record exists, and he, or\r\nthey, did work of a like nature for the powerful house of Bourgogne, and\r\nfor Rene d'Anjou, whom we know was a great amateur gardener.\r\n\r\nThe archives of these princely houses often recount the expenses in\r\ndetail, and so numerous are certain of them that it would not be\r\ndifficult to picture anew as to just what they referred.\r\n\r\nDebanes, the gardener of the Chateau d'Angers, on a certain occasion,\r\ngave an accounting for \"X Sols\" for repairing the grass-plots and for\r\nmaking a _petit preau_. Again: \"XI Sols\" for the employ of six gardeners\r\nto trim the vines and clean up the alleys of the _grand_ and _petit\r\njardin_.\r\n\r\nLuxury in all things settled down upon all France to a greater degree\r\nthan hitherto in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and almost\r\nwithout exception princely houses set out to rival one another in the\r\nsplendour of their surroundings. Now came in the ornamental garden as\r\ndistinct from the _verger_, and the _preau_ became a greensward\r\naccessory, at once practical and decorative, the precursor of the\r\n_pelouse_ and the _parterre_ of Le Notre.\r\n\r\nThe _preau_ (in old French _prael_) was a symmetrical square or\r\nrectangular grass-grown garden plot. From the Latin _pratum_, or\r\n_pratellum_, the words _preau_, _pre_ and _prairie_ were evolved\r\nnaturally enough, and came thus early to be applied in France to that\r\nportion of the pleasure garden set out as a grassy lawn. The word is\r\nvery ancient, and has come down to us through the monkish vocabulary of\r\nthe cloister.\r\n\r\nSome celebrated verse of Christine de Pisan, who wrote \"The Life of\r\nCharles V,\" thus describes the cloister at Poissy.\r\n\r\n   \"Du cloistre grand large et especieux\r\n   Que est carre, et, afin qu'il soit mieulx\r\n   A un prael, ou milieu, gracieux\r\n   Vert sans grappin\r\n   Ou a plante en my un tres hault pin.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this period, that of Saint Louis and the apotheosis of Gothic\r\narchitecture, that France was at the head of European civilization,\r\ntherefore in no way can her preeminence in garden-making be questioned.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of the Gothic era seldom surpassed the _enclos_ with a\r\nrivulet passing through it, a spring, a pine tree giving a welcome\r\nshade, some simple flowers and a _verger_ of fruit trees.\r\n\r\nThe neighbours of France were often warring among themselves but the\r\nGrand Seigneur here was settling down to beautifying his surroundings\r\nand framing his chateaux, manors and country-seats in dignified and most\r\nappealing pictures. Grass-plots appeared in dooryards, flowers climbed\r\nup along castle walls and shrubs and trees came to play a genuinely\r\nesthetic role in the life of the times.\r\n\r\nAn illustrious stranger, banished from Italy, one Brunetto Latini, the\r\nmaster of Dante, who had sought a refuge in France, wrote his views on\r\nthe matter, which in substance were as above.\r\n\r\nAbout this time originated the progenitors of the _gloriettes_, which\r\nbecame so greatly the vogue in the eighteenth century. Practically the\r\n_gloriette_, a word in common use in northern France and in Flanders,\r\nwas a _logette de plaisance_. The Spaniards, too, in their _glorietta_,\r\na pavilion in a garden, had practically the same signification of the\r\nword.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century French garden the _gloriette_ was a sort of\r\narbour, or trellis-like summer-house, garnished with vines and often\r\nperched upon a natural or artificial eminence. Other fast developing\r\ndetails of the French garden were tree-bordered alleys and the planting\r\nof more or less regularly set-out beds of flowering plants.\r\n\r\nVine trellises and vine-clad pavilions and groves were a speedy\r\ndevelopment of these details, and played parts of considerable\r\nimportance in gardening under the French Renaissance.\r\n\r\nIn this same connection there is a very precise record in an account of\r\nthe gardens of the Louvre under Charles V concerning the contribution of\r\none, Jean Baril, maker of Arlors, to this form of the landscape\r\narchitect's art.\r\n\r\n\"Ornamental birds--peacocks, pheasants and swans now came in as adjuncts\r\nto the French land and water garden.\" This was the way a certain\r\npertinent comment was made by a writer of the fifteenth century. From\r\nthe \"Menagier de Paris,\" a work of the end of the fourteenth century,\r\none learns that behind a dwelling of a prince or noble of the time was\r\nusually to be found a \"_beau jardin tout plante d'arbres a fruits, de\r\nlegumes, de rosiers, orne de volieres et tapise de gazon sur lesquels se\r\npromenent les paons_.\"\r\n\r\nFrench gardens of various epochs are readily distinguished by the width\r\nof their alleys. In the moyen-age the paths which separated the garden\r\nplots were very narrow; in the early Renaissance period they were\r\nsomewhat wider, taking on a supreme maximum in the gardens of Le Notre.\r\n\r\nTrimmed trees entered into the general scheme in France towards the end\r\nof the fifteenth century. Under Henri IV and under Louis XII trees were\r\noften trimmed in ungainly, fantastic forms, but with the advent of Le\r\nNotre the good taste which he propagated so widely promptly rejected\r\nthese grotesques, which, for a fact, were an importation from Flanders,\r\nlike the _gloriettes_. Not by the remotest suggestion could a clipped\r\nyew in the form of a peacock or a giraffe be called French. Le Notre\r\neliminated the menagerie and the aviary, but kept certain geometrical\r\nforms, particularly with respect to hedges, where niches were frequently\r\ntrimmed out for the placing of statues, columns surmounted with golden\r\nballs, etc.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the frankly Renaissance gardens developed as a result\r\nof the migrations of the French monarchs in Italy were those surrounding\r\nsuch palaces and chateaux as Fontainebleau, Amboise, and Blois. Often\r\nthese manifestly French gardens, though of Italian inspiration in the\r\nfirst instance, were actually the work of Italian craftsmen. Pucello\r\nMarceliano at four hundred _livres_ and Edme Marceliano at two hundred\r\n_livres_ were in the employ of Henri II. It was the former who laid out\r\nthe magnificent _Parterre de Diane_ at Chenonceaux, where Catherine de\r\nMedici later, being smitten with the skill of the Florentines, gave the\r\nfurther commission of the _Jardin Vert_, which was intended to complete\r\nthis _parterre_, to Henri le Calabrese and Jean Collo.\r\n\r\nThe later Renaissance gardens divided themselves into various classes,\r\n_jardins de plaisir_, _jardins de plaisance_, _jardins de proprete_,\r\netc. _Parterres_ now became of two sorts, _parterres a compartiments_\r\nand _parterres de broderies_, names sufficiently explicit not to need\r\nfurther comment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _\"Parterre de Diane,\" Chenonceaux_]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine just how garden _broderies_ came into\r\nbeing. They may have been indirectly due to woman's love of embroidery\r\nand the garden alike. The making of these garden _broderies_ was a\r\nhighly cultivated art. Pierre Vallet, embroiderer to Henri IV, created\r\nmuch in his line of distinction and note, and acquired an extensive\r\nclientele for his flowers and models. Often these gardens, with their\r\n_parterres_ and _broderies_ were mere additions to an already existing\r\narchitectural scheme, but with respect to the gardens of the Luxembourg\r\nand Saint Germain-en-Laye they came into being with the edifices\r\nthemselves, or at least those portions which they were supposed to\r\nembellish. Harmony was then first struck between the works of the\r\nhorticulturist--the garden-maker--and those of the architect--the\r\nbuilder in stone and wood. This was the prelude to those majestic\r\nensembles of which Le Notre was to be the composer.\r\n\r\nOf the celebrated French palace and chateau gardens which are not\r\ncentered upon the actual edifices with which they are more or less\r\nintimately connected, but are distinct and apart from the gardens which\r\nin most cases actually surround a dwelling, may be mentioned those of\r\nMontargis, Saint Germain, Amboise, Villers-Cotterets and Fontainebleau.\r\nThese are rather parks, like the \"home-parks,\" so called, in England,\r\nwhich, while adjuncts to the dwellings, are complete in themselves and\r\nare possessed of a separate identity, or reason for being. Chiefly\r\nthese, and indeed most French gardens of the same epoch, differ greatly\r\nfrom contemporary works in Italy in that the latter were often built and\r\nterraced up and down the hillsides, whereas the French garden was laid\r\nout, in the majority of instances, on the level, though each made use of\r\ninterpolated architectural accessories such as balustrades, statuary,\r\nfountains, etc.\r\n\r\nMollet was one of the most famous gardeners of the time of Louis XIV. He\r\nwas the gardener of the Duc d'Aumale, who built the gardens of the\r\nChateau d'Anet while it was occupied by Diane de Poitiers, and for their\r\ntime they were considered the most celebrated in France for their upkeep\r\nand the profusion and variety of their flowers. This was the highest\r\ndevelopment of the French garden up to this time.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this Claude Mollet was the creator of the\r\n_parterres_ and _broderies_ so largely used in his time, and after.\r\nMollet's formula was derived chiefly from flower and plant forms,\r\nresembling in design oriental embroideries. He made equal use of the\r\nlabyrinth and the sunken garden. His idea was to develop the simple\r\n_parquet_ into the elaborate _parterre_. He began his career under Henri\r\nIII and ultimately became the gardener of Henri IV. His elaborate work\r\n\"Theatre des Plans et Jardinage\" was written towards 1610-1612, but was\r\nonly published a half a century later. It was only in the sixteenth\r\ncentury that gardens in Paris were planned and developed on a scale\r\nwhich was the equal of many which had previously been designed in the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN of SUNKEN GARDEN (_JARDIN CREUX_)]\r\n\r\nThe chief names in French gardening--before the days of Le Notre--were\r\nthose of the two Mollets, the brothers Boyceau, de la Barauderie and\r\nJacques de Menours, and all successively held the post of Superintendent\r\nof the Garden of the King.\r\n\r\nIn these royal gardens there was always a distinctly notable feature,\r\nthe _grand roiales_, the principal avenues, or alleys, which were here\r\nfound on a more ambitious scale than in any of the private gardens of\r\nthe nobility. The central avenue was always of the most generous\r\nproportions, the nomenclature coming from royal--the _grand roial_ being\r\nthe equivalent of _Allee Royale_, that is, Avenue Royal.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the sixteenth century the Garden of the Tuileries, which\r\nwas later to be entirely transformed by Le Notre, offered an interesting\r\naspect of the _parquet_ at its best. In \"_Paris a Travers les Ages_\" one\r\nreads that from the windows of the palace the garden resembled a great\r\nchecker-board containing more than a hundred uniform _carreaux_. There\r\nwere six wide longitudinal alleys or avenues cut across by eight or ten\r\nsmaller alleys which produced this rectangular effect. Within some of\r\nthe squares were single, or grouped trees; in others the conventional\r\n_quincunx_; others were mere expanses of lawn, and still others had\r\nflowers arranged in symmetrical patterns. In one of these squares was a\r\ndesign which showed the escutcheons of the arms of France and those of\r\nthe Medici. These gardens of the Tuileries were first modified by a\r\nproject of Bernard Palissy, the porcelainiste. He let his fancy have\r\nfull sway and the criss-cross alleys and avenues were set out at their\r\njunctures with moulded ornaments, enamelled miniatures, turtles in\r\nfaience and frogs in porcelain. It was this, perhaps, which gave the\r\nimpetus to the French for their fondness to-day for similar effects, but\r\nBernard Palissy doubtless never went so far as plaster cats on a\r\nridgepole, as one may see to-day on many a pretty villa in northern\r\nFrance. This certainly lent an element of picturesqueness to the\r\nRenaissance Garden of the Louvre, a development of the same spirit which\r\ninspired this artist in his collaboration at Chenonceaux. This was the\r\nformula which produced the _jardin delectable_, an exaggeration of the\r\ntaste of the epoch, but still critical of its time.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of the Renaissance readily divided themselves into two\r\nclasses, those of the _parterres a compartiments_ and those of the\r\n_parterres de broderies_. The former, under Francis I and Henri II, were\r\ndivided into geometrical compartments thoroughly in the taste of the\r\nRenaissance, but bordered frequently with representations of designs\r\ntaken from Venetian lace and various other contemporary stuffs. There\r\nwere other _parterres_, where the compartments were planned on a more\r\nutilitarian scale; in other words, they were the _potagers_ which\r\nrendered the garden, said Olivier de Serres, one of \"profitable\r\nbeauty.\" Some of the compartments were devoted entirely to herbs and\r\nmedicinal plants while others were entirely given over to flowers. In\r\ngeneral the compartments were renewed twice a year, in May and August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Parterre_]\r\n\r\nThe _Grand Parterre_ at Fontainebleau, called in other days the\r\n_Parterre de Tiber_, offered as remarkable an example of the terrace\r\ngarden as was to be found in France, the terraces rising a metre or more\r\nabove the actual garden plot and enclosing a sort of horticultural\r\narena.\r\n\r\nIt was in the sixteenth century that architectural motives came to be\r\nincorporated into the gardens in the form of square, round or octagonal\r\npavilions, and here and there were added considerable areas of tiled\r\npavements, features which were found at their best in the gardens of the\r\nChateau de Gaillon and at Langeais.\r\n\r\nOne special and distinct feature of the French Renaissance garden was\r\nthe labyrinth, of which three forms were known. The first was composed\r\nof merely low borders, the second of hedges shoulder high, or even\r\ntaller, and the third was practically a roofed-over grove. The latter\r\ninvention was due, it is said, to the discreet Louis XIV. In the\r\nTuileries garden, in the time of Catherine de Medici, there was a\r\nlabyrinth greatly in vogue with the Parisian nobles who \"found much\r\npleasure in amusing themselves therein.\"\r\n\r\nIn that garden the labyrinth was sometimes called the \"Road of\r\nJerusalem\" and it was presumably of eastern origin.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century grottos came to be added to the garden,\r\nthough this is seemingly an Italian tradition of much earlier date.\r\nAmong the notable grottos of this time were that of the _Jardin des\r\nPins_ at Fontainebleau, and that of the Chateau de Meudon, built by\r\nPhilibert Delorme, of which Ronsard celebrated its beauties in verse.\r\nThe art was not confined to the gardens of royalties and the nobility,\r\nfor the _bourgeoisie_ speedily took up with the puerile idea (said to\r\nhave come from Holland, by the way), and built themselves grottos of\r\nshells, plaster and boulders. It was then that the _chiens de faience_,\r\nwhich the smug Paris suburbanite of to-day so loves, were born.\r\n\r\nBy the seventeenth century the equalized _carreaux_ of the early\r\ngeometrically disposed gardens were often replaced with the oblongs,\r\ncircles and, somewhat timidly introduced, more bizarre forms, the idea\r\nbeing to give variety to the ensemble. There was less fear for the\r\nartistic effect of great open spaces than had formerly existed, and the\r\navenues and alleys were considerably enlarged, and such architectural\r\nand sculptural accessories as fountains, balustrades and perrons were\r\ndesigned on a more extensive scale. Basins and canals and other\r\nrestrained surfaces of water began to appear on a larger scale, and\r\ngreater insistence was put upon their proportions with regard to the\r\ndecorative part which they were to play in the ensemble.\r\n\r\nThis was the preparatory period of the coming into being of the works of\r\nLe Notre and Mansart.\r\n\r\nThe _Grand Siecle_ lent a profound majesty to royal and noble dwellings,\r\nand its effect is no less to be remarked upon than the character of\r\ntheir gardens. The moving spirit which ordained all these things was the\r\nwill of the _Roi Soleil_.\r\n\r\n_Parterres_ and _broderies_ were designed on even a grander scale than\r\nbefore. They were frequently grouped into four equal parts with a\r\ncircular basin in the centre, and mirror-like basins of water sprang up\r\non all sides.\r\n\r\nClose to the royal dwelling was the fore-court, as often dressed out\r\nwith flowers and lawn as with tiles and flags. From it radiated long\r\nalleys and avenues, stretching out almost to infinity. At this time the\r\ngrass-plots were developed to high order, and there were groves,\r\nrest-houses, bowers, and _theatres de verdure_ at each turning.\r\nTennis-courts came to be a regularly installed accessory, and the basins\r\nand \"mirrors\" of water were frequently supplemented by cascades, and\r\nsome of the canals were so large that barges of state floated thereon.\r\nOver some of the canals bridges were built as fantastic in design as\r\nthose of the Japanese, and again others as monumental as the Pont Neuf.\r\n\r\nIn their majestic regularity the French gardens of the seventeenth\r\ncentury possessed an admirable solemnity, albeit their amplitude and\r\nmajesty give rise to justifiable criticism. It is this criticism that\r\nqualifies the values of such gardens as those of Versailles and Vaux,\r\nbut one must admit that the scale on which they were planned has much to\r\ndo with this, and certainly if they had been attached to less majestic\r\nedifices the comment would have been even more justifiable. As it is,\r\nthe criticism must be qualified.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the garden by this time had been greatly modified. Aside\r\nfrom such great ensembles as those of Versailles was now to be\r\nconsidered a taste for something smaller, but often overcrowded with\r\naccessories of the same nature, which compared so well with the vastness\r\nof Versailles, but which, on the other hand, looked so out of place in\r\nminiature.\r\n\r\nIt was not long now before the \"style pompadour\" began to make itself\r\nshown with regard to garden design--the exaggeration of an undeniable\r\ngrace by an affected mannerism. All the rococco details which had been\r\napplied to architecture now began to find their duplication in the\r\ngarden rockeries--weird fantasies built of plaster and even shells of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nBy later years of the eighteenth century there came on the scene as a\r\ndesigner of gardens one, De Neufforge. His work was a prelude to the\r\nclassicism of the style of Louis XVI which was to come. There was, too,\r\nat this time a disposition towards the English garden, but only a slight\r\ntendency, though towards 1780 the conventional French garden had been\r\npractically abandoned. The revolution in the art of garden-making\r\ntherefore preceded that of the world of politics by some years.\r\n\r\nThere are three or four works which give specific details on these\r\nquestions. They are \"_De la Distribution des Maisons de Plaisance_,\" by\r\nBlondel (1773), his \"_Cours d'Architecture_\" of the same date, and\r\nPanseron's volume entitled \"_Recueil de Jardinage_,\" published in 1783.\r\n\r\nThe following brief resume shows the various steps through which the\r\nFrench formal garden passed. In the moyen-age the garden was a thing\r\nquite apart from the dwelling, and was but a diminutive dooryard sort of\r\na garden. The garden of the Renaissance amplified the regular lines\r\nwhich existed in the moyen-age, but was often quite as little in accord\r\nwith the dwelling that it surrounded as its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe union of the garden and the dwelling and its dependencies was\r\nclearly marked under Louis XIV, while the gardens of Louis XV tended\r\nsomewhat to modify the grand lines and the majestic presence of those of\r\nhis elder. These gardens of Louis XV were more fantastic, and followed\r\nless the lines of traditional good taste. Shapes and forms were\r\ncomplicated and indeed inexplicably mixed into a melange that one could\r\nhardly recognize for one thing or another, certainly not as examples of\r\nany well-meaning styles which have lasted until to-day. The straight\r\nline now disappeared in favour of the most dissolute and irrational\r\ncurves imaginable, and the sober majesty of the gardens of Louis XIV\r\nbecame a tangle of warring elements, fine in parts and not\r\nuninteresting, effective, even, here and there, but as a whole an\r\naggravation.\r\n\r\nFinally the reaction came for something more simple and more in harmony\r\nwith rational taste.\r\n\r\nThe best example remaining of the Louis XV garden is that which\r\nsurrounds the _Pavillon de Musique_ of the Petit Trianon, an addition\r\nto the garden which Louis XIV had given to the Grand Trianon. By\r\ncomparison with the big garden of Le Notre this latter conception is as\r\na boudoir to a reception hall.\r\n\r\nThe garden of Louis XVI was a composite, with interpolations from across\r\nthe Rhine, from Holland and Belgium and from England even; features\r\nwhich got no great hold, however, but which, for a time, gave it an air\r\nless French than anything which had gone before.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the nineteenth century the formal garden was\r\npractically abandoned in France. It was the period of the real decadence\r\nof the formal garden. This came not from one cause alone but from many.\r\nTo the straight lines and gentle curves of former generations upon\r\ngenerations of French gardens were added sinuosities as varied and\r\ncomplicated as those of the Vale of Cashmere, and again, with tiny stars\r\nand crescents and what not, the ground resembled an ornamental ceiling\r\nmore than it did a garden. The sentimentalism of the epoch did its part,\r\nand accentuated the desire to carry out personal tastes rather than\r\nbuild on traditionally accepted lines. The taste for the English garden\r\ngrew apace in France, and many a noble plantation was remodelled on\r\nthese lines, or rooted up altogether. Immediately neighbouring upon the\r\ndwelling the garden still bore some resemblance to its former outlines,\r\nbut, as it drew farther away, it became a park, a wildwood or a\r\npreserve.\r\n\r\nIsabey Pere, a miniaturist, under Napoleonic stimulus, designed a number\r\nof French gardens in the early years of the nineteenth century,\r\nfollowing more or less the conventional lines of the best work of the\r\nseventeenth century, and succeeded admirably in a small way in\r\nresuscitating the fallen taste. Isabey's gardens may have lacked much\r\nthat was remarkable in the best work of Le Notre, but they were\r\nconsiderably better than anything of a similar nature, so far as\r\nindicating a commendable desire to return to better ideals.\r\n\r\nUnder the Second Empire a great impulse was given to garden design and\r\nmaking in Paris itself. It was then that the parks and squares came\r\nreally to enter into the artistic conception of what a city beautiful\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\nLeaving the gardens of the Tuileries and the Luxembourg out of the\r\nquestion, the Parc Monceau and that of the Buttes Chaumont of to-day,\r\nthe descendants of these first Paris gardens show plainly how thoroughly\r\ngood they were in design and execution.\r\n\r\nThe majority of professional gardeners of renown in France made their\r\nfirst successes with the gardens of the city of Paris, reproducing the\r\nbest of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth century work, which\r\nhad endured without the competition of later years having dulled its\r\nbeauty, though perhaps the _parterres_ of to-day are rather more warm in\r\ncolouring, even cruder, than those of a former time.\r\n\r\nThe _jardin fleuriste_ and the _parterre horticole_ of the nineteenth\r\ncentury appealed however quite as much in their general arrangement and\r\nthe modification of their details and their rainbow colours, as any\r\nsince the time of Louis XVI. According to the expert definition the\r\n_jardin fleuriste_ was a \"garden reserved exclusively to the culture and\r\nornamental disposition of plants giving forth rich leaves and beautiful\r\nflowers.\" The above quoted description is decidedly apt.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century French garden formed a superb framing for the\r\nanimated fetes and reunions in which took part such a brilliant array of\r\nlords and ladies of the court as may have been invited to taste the\r\ndelicacies of a fete amid such luxurious appointments.\r\n\r\nThe fashionable and courtly life of the day, so far as its open-air\r\naspect was concerned, centered around these gardens and parks of the\r\ngreat houses of royalty and the nobility. The costume of the folk of the\r\ntime, with cloak and sword and robes of silk and velvet and gilded\r\ncarriages and _chaises-a-porteurs_, had little in common with the\r\nout-of-door garden-party life of to-day, where the guests arrive in\r\nautomobiles, be-rugged and be-goggled and somewhat the worse for a dusty\r\njourney. It is for this reason that Versailles and Vaux-le-Vicomte, in\r\nspite of the suggestion of sumptuousness which they still retain, are,\r\nfrom all points of view, more or less out of scale with the life of our\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe modern garden, whether laid out in regular lines, or on an\r\nornamental scale, as a flower garden purely, or in a composite style, is\r\nusually but an adjunct to the modern chateau, villa or cottage. It is\r\nmore intimate than the vast, more theatrically disposed area of old, and\r\nis more nearly an indication of the personal tastes of the owner because\r\nof its restrained proportions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bassin de la Couronne, Vaux-le-Vicomte_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL HUNT IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nJust how great a part the royal hunt played in the open-air life of the\r\nFrench court all who know their French history and have any familiarity\r\nwith the great forests of France well recognize.\r\n\r\nThe echo of French country architecture as evinced in the \"_maisons de\r\nplaisance_\" and \"_rendezvous de chasse_\" scattered up and down the\r\nFrance of monarchial times lives until to-day, scarcely fainter than\r\nwhen the note was originally sounded. Often these establishments were\r\nsomething more than a mere hunting-lodge, or shooting-box, indeed they\r\ngenerally aspired to the proportions of what may readily be accepted as\r\na country-house. They established a specious type of architecture which\r\nin many cases grew, in later years, into a chateau or palace of\r\nmanifestly magnificent appointments.\r\n\r\nAt the great hunting exposition recently held at Vienna the _clou_ of\r\nthe display was a French royal hunting-lodge in the style of Louis XVI,\r\nhung with veritable Gobelin tapestries, loaned by the French government\r\nand picturing \"The Hunt in France.\" It was called by the critics a\r\nunique painting in a beautiful frame.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Francis I and his sons, the royal hunt was given a great\r\nimpetus by Catherine de Medici, wife of Henri II.\r\n\r\nFrancis, in company with his sons, had gone to Marseilles to meet the\r\nMedici bride, who was on her way to make her home at the Paris Louvre,\r\nand when he found her possessed of so lively manners and such great\r\nintelligence he became so charmed with her that, it is said, he danced\r\nwith her all of the first evening. What pleased the monarch even more,\r\nand perhaps not less his sons, was that she shot with an arquebuse like\r\na sharpshooter, and could ride to hounds like a natural-born Amazon. She\r\nwas more than a rival, as it afterwards proved, of that arch-huntress,\r\nDiane de Poitiers.\r\n\r\nHistory recounts in detail that last royal hunt of Francis I at\r\nRambouillet, when he was lying near to death, the guest of his old\r\nfriend, d'Angennes.\r\n\r\nThe old manor, half hunting-lodge, half fortress, and very nearly royal\r\nin all its appointments, proved a comfortable enough rest-house, and on\r\nthe day after his arrival, in March, 1547, the monarch commanded the\r\npreparations for a royal hunt to commence at daybreak in the\r\nneighbouring forest.\r\n\r\nThe equipage started forth in full ceremonial on the quest of stag and\r\nboar. The bugles blew and a sort of stimulated courage once more entered\r\nthe king's breast, courage born of the excitement around him, the baying\r\nof the hounds and the tramping and neighing of impatient horses. He had\r\nforced himself from his bed and on horseback and started off with the\r\nrest, defying the better counsel of his retainers.\r\n\r\nHis strength proved to be born of a fictitious enthusiasm, and, speedily\r\nlosing interest, he was brought back to the manor where he had his\r\napartments, and put speechless and half dead to bed, actually dying the\r\nnext day from this last over-exertion, scarce half a century of the span\r\nof his life accomplished.\r\n\r\nHenri de Navarre also was a true lover of the open. Born in a mountain\r\ntown in the Pyrenees he would rather camp on a bed of pine needles in\r\nthe forest than lie on a tuft of down. He preferred his beloved Bayonne\r\nham, spiced with garlic, to a sumptuous dinner in _Jarnet_ house, a\r\nfamous Paris tavern of the day; and had rather quench his thirst with a\r\nquaff of the wine of Jurancon than the finest _cru_ in Paris cellars.\r\n\r\nHe hated the parade of courts, was dirty, unkempt and careless, a\r\ngenuine son of the soil, heedless of fate, and an excellent huntsman.\r\n\r\nUp to the seventeenth century the ladies of the French court showed a\r\nkeener interest for falconry than for the hunt by horse and hounds.\r\n\r\nThe heroines of the Fronde, and the generation which followed, seemed to\r\nlose interest in this form of sport, and gave their favour to packs of\r\nhounds, and followed with equal interest the hunt for deer, wolves,\r\nboars, foxes and hares as they were tracked through forests and over\r\narid wastes.\r\n\r\nThe old hunting horn, the winding horn of romance, still exists at the\r\nhunts of France, a relic of the days of Louis XIV. It sounds the\r\nconventional comings and goings of the huntsmen in the same classic\r\nphraseology as of old--the _lancer_, the _bien allee_, the _vue_, the\r\n_changement de foret_, the _accompagne_, the _bat l'eau_, the _hallali\r\npar terre_, and the _curee_.\r\n\r\nThe \"_Curee aux Flambeaux_\" was one of the most picturesque ceremonies\r\nconnected with the royal hunt in France. It began in the gallant days,\r\nand lived even until the time of the Second Empire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A \"Curee aux Flambeaux\"_]\r\n\r\nThe _curee_, that is the giving up to the hounds the remains of an\r\nanimal slain in chase, does not always take place at night, but when\r\nit does the torches play the part of impressive and picturesque\r\naccessories. When a _curee_ takes place at the spot where the animal is\r\nactually killed the French sporting term for the ceremony is \"_force et\r\nabattu_.\" This, however, is usually preceded by another called \"_le\r\npied_,\" which consists in cutting off one of the feet of the dead animal\r\nand offering it to the person in whose honor the hunt was held.\r\n\r\nWhen the _curee_ takes place by torchlight the body of the animal is\r\ncarried beneath the windows of the chateau, a circle is formed by the\r\n\"_piqueurs_,\" or head hunters, and all who have participated in the\r\npursuit; and, to the sound of a trumpet, loaned by the sportsmen, one of\r\nthe _valets de venerie_ cuts up the stag. The _meutes_, that is to say,\r\nthe hounds which are let slip last of all, and which terminates the\r\nchase--are then brought by the _valet des chiens_, who has great\r\ndifficulty in keeping them from breaking loose. When the entrails have\r\nbeen cut away the valet sits astride the animal, holding up the _nappe_,\r\nor head and neck, shaking it at the already furious hounds. It is the\r\ncare of the valet during this interval to conceal the pieces of flesh\r\nwhich are still under the body. The hounds are then loosened, but are\r\nkept within bounds by the whips of the _piqueurs_ and the _valet des\r\nchiens_. When the dogs are sufficiently exasperated the brutes are\r\nallowed to rush upon the remains of their victim; only, however, to be\r\ndriven back again by whipping. When their docility has thus been proven\r\nthe definite signal, \"_lachez tout_,\" is given, and the hounds rush\r\ntowards the stag.\r\n\r\nThe _curee_ then presents a savage spectacle: the air is filled with\r\ngrowling, barking and yelling, while the ground is covered with\r\nscrambling dogs, their mouths reeking with blood.\r\n\r\nThe feminine costume for the hunt in the time of Louis XIII was of\r\nbroadcloth or velvet, with a great feather-ornamented \"picture\" hat.\r\nOnly now and again a lady on horseback after 1650 dared borrow doublet\r\nand jacket, and mount astride.\r\n\r\nThe ladies followed the hunt of Louis XIV on horseback, seldom, if ever,\r\nin the older manner of sitting behind their cavalier on the same steed.\r\nFrom the time of Catherine de Medici, indeed, the Italian side-saddle\r\nhad become the fashion for women.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XV the ladies sought a little more comfort, and followed the\r\nequipage sitting in a sort of hamper-like, diminutive basket, hung from\r\nthe broad back of a sturdy quadruped. Dresses became more fanciful,\r\nboth in materials and colours. From this it was but a step to even more\r\nelaborate toilettes which necessitated a conveyance of some sort on\r\nwheels, but the most intrepid still clung to the traditionally classic\r\nmethods. Marie Antoinette had her _equipage de chasse_, and Madame\r\nDurfort was constantly abroad in the forests of Montmorency and Boissy,\r\ndirecting the operation of eight or ten professional huntsmen. Among her\r\nguests were frequently the ambassadors of Prussia, Russia and Austria.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Louis XIV the Comtesse de Lude devoted herself to the\r\nhunt with a frenzy born of an inordinate enthusiasm. At the head of a\r\npack of hounds she knew no obstacle, and, on one occasion, penetrated on\r\nhorseback, followed by her dogs, into the oratory of the nuns of the\r\nConvent of Estival.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the seventeenth century the hunt in France had become no\r\nmore a sport for ladies. Hunting was still a noble sport, but it was\r\nmore for men than for women. The court hunted not only in royal company,\r\nbut accepted invitations from any seigneur who possessed an ample\r\npreserve and who could put up a good kill; magistrates, financiers and\r\nbishops, indeed all classes, became followers of the hunt.\r\n\r\nMontgaillard tells of a hunt in which he took part on the feast day of\r\nSaint Bernard, with the monks of the Bernardin Convent in Languedoc. In\r\nthe episcopal domain of Saverne six hundred beaters were employed on one\r\noccasion to provide sport for an assembled company of lords and ladies.\r\nThese were the days when the bishops were in truth _Grand Seigneurs_.\r\n\r\nThe women of the court, while they played the game, ceded nothing to the\r\nmen in bravery. Neither rain, hail nor snow frightened them. On the 28th\r\nof June, 1713, Louis XIV was hunting the deer at Rambouillet when a\r\nterrific, cyclonic storm fell upon the equipage, but not a man nor woman\r\nin the monarch's party quit. The Duchesse de Berry was \"wet to the\r\nskin,\" but her ardour for the hunt was not in the least cooled.\r\n\r\nTo-day at Fontainebleau or Rambouillet the echo is sounded from the\r\nhunting horn of Labaudy, the sugar-king, who pulls off at least two\r\n\"hunts,\" with his spectacular equipage, each year, and it is a sight\r\ntoo; a French hunting party was ever picturesque, and if to-day not as\r\npractical as the more blood-loving Englishman's hunt, is at least\r\ntraditionally sentimental, even artificial to the extent, at any rate,\r\nthat it seems stagy, even to the inclusion of the automobiles which\r\nbring and carry away the participants. \"Other days, other ways\" never\r\nhad a more strict application than to _la chasse a courre_ in France.\r\n\r\nTwo accounts are here given of two comparatively modern figures in the\r\nFrench hunting field, which show the great store set by the sport in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn the annals of the Chateau de Grosbois, belonging to-day to the Prince\r\nde Wagram, are the accounts of an early nineteenth century hunt, which\r\nshows that the game cost dear. The \"Grand Veneur\" of the Napoleonic\r\nreign was a master sportsman, indeed, and to-day, in a gallery of the\r\nchateau, are preserved the guns of the master, his hunting crop and\r\nsaddle, his \"colours\" and his hunting horn.\r\n\r\nFrom the registers of the chateau, under date of December 10, 1809, the\r\nfollowing, which concerned a hunting party given by the chatelain, is\r\nextracted verbatim.\r\n\r\n   Note of the Maitre d'Hotel for collations for the guests   8,226 francs\r\n\r\n   Illuminations                                              1,080 francs\r\n\r\n   Gratifications to the beaters                              1,000 francs\r\n\r\n   Eau de Cologne for the ladies                                 30 francs\r\n\r\n   Gun-bearers                                                  148 francs\r\n\r\n   Helpers (150)                                                600 francs\r\n\r\n   Aids (200)                                                    315 francs\r\n\r\nAnother hunt was given in 1811, in honour of Napoleon, when such items\r\nas three thousand francs for an orchestra, a like sum for bouquets for\r\nthe ladies, a thousand or two for bonbons and fans, and twelve thousand\r\nfor hired furniture, etc., to say nothing of the expenses of the hunt\r\nitself, made the bag somewhat costly. It was not always easy for the\r\nmaster of the hunt to get justice when it came to paying for his\r\nsupplies, and in these same records a mention of a dozen leather\r\nbreeches at a hundred and forty francs each was crossed off and a\r\nmarginal note, _Non_, added in the hand of Marechal Berthier, Prince de\r\nWagram, himself.\r\n\r\nThe chief figure in the French hunting world of to-day is another\r\ndescendant of the Napoleonic portrait gallery, Prince Murat. At the age\r\nof twelve the young Prince Joachim had already followed the hounds at\r\nFontainebleau and Compiegne. In his double quality of relative and\r\ncompanion of the Prince Imperial he was one of the chiefs of the\r\nequipment of the Imperial Hunt. To-day, though well past the span of\r\nlife, he is as active and as enduring in his participation in the\r\nstrenuous sport as many a younger man and his knowledge of the grand art\r\nof _venerie_, and his ardour for being always ahead with the hounds, is\r\nnoted by all who may happen to see him while jaunting through the\r\nForet de Compiegne, keeping well up with the traditions of his worthy\r\nelder, the \"Premier Cavalier\" of the First Empire, the King of Naples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _An Imperial Hunt at Fontainebleau_]\r\n\r\nHe won his first stripes in the hunting field at Compiegne in 1868, at a\r\nhunt given in honour of the Prince de Hohenzollern and the Princesse,\r\nwho was the sister of the King of Portugal. It was a most moving event,\r\nso much so that it just escaped being turned into a drama, for one of\r\nthe ladies of the court had a leg broken, and the minister, Fould, was\r\nalmost mortally injured. A \"_dix cors_,\" a stag with antlers of ten\r\nbranches, had been run down at the Rond Royal where it had taken refuge\r\nin a near-by copse, and after an hour's hard chase was finally cornered\r\nin the courtyard of some farm buildings of the Hameau d'Orillets. A\r\ntroop of cows was entering the courtyard at the same moment, and a most\r\nconfused melee ensued. The Inspector of Forests saved the situation and\r\nthe cows of the farmer, and the stag fell to the carabine of Prince de\r\nla Moskowa, with the young Prince Murat on his pony in the very front\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nThus early initiated in the chivalrous sport of the hunt the young man\r\nfollowed every hunt, big or little, which was held in the environs of\r\nParis for many years, and by the time that he came to possess the\r\nepaulettes of an Officier de Cuirassiers he was known to all the hunts\r\nfrom the Ardennes to Anjou.\r\n\r\nFor the past generation he has been retired to civil life by a\r\nRepublican decree, and since that time has lived in his suburban Paris\r\nproperty, devoting himself to the raising of hunters. Here he lives\r\nalmost on the borders of that great extent of forest which occupies the\r\nnorthern section of the Ile de France, occasionally organizing a hunt,\r\nwhich takes on not a little of the noble aspect of a former time, the\r\nprince following always within sound of the hunting horn and the baying\r\nof the hounds, if not actually always within sight of the quarry.\r\n\r\nIt is here, in his Villa Normande, near which Saint Ouen gave Dagobert\r\nthat famous counsel which has gone down in history, that the Prince and\r\nPrincesse Murat come to pass two or three months each year with their\r\nchildren, their allied parents and the \"great guns\" of the old regime\r\nwho still gather about the master of the hunt as courtiers gather around\r\ntheir king.\r\n\r\nAt Chamblay there have been held magnificent gun shoots under the\r\norganization of the prince and his equipage. His kennels contain\r\nforty-eight of the finest bred hounds in France, and are guarded by\r\nthree caretakers, the goader, Carl, whose fame has reached every\r\nhunting court of Europe and a couple of _valets des chiens_. The\r\nprince's colours are distributed as follows: a huzzar jacket of blue,\r\nwith collar, plaquettes, and vest of grenadine and breeches of a darker\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nFormerly Prince Murat hunted the roe-deer in the valley of the Oise, but\r\nmany enclosures of private property having made this exceedingly\r\ndifficult in later years he is to-day obliged to go farther afield. In\r\nthe spring the equipage goes to Rosny, near Mantes, and perhaps during\r\nthe same season occasionally to Rambouillet.\r\n\r\nThe hunts at Chamblay are the perfection of the practice of the art.\r\nSeldom is the quarry wanting. The refrain of the Ode to Saint Hubert\r\nlauds the prowess of this great \"Maitre d'Equipage.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Par Saint Hubert mon patron\r\n   C'est quelque due de haut renom\r\n        *       *       *\r\n   Sonnez: ecuyers et piqueux\r\n   Un Murat vien en ces lieux.\"\r\n\r\nChamblay fortunately being neither populous nor near a great town there\r\nis no throng of curious spectators hovering about to get in the way and\r\nscare the game and the hounds and their followers out of their wits. The\r\nChasse de Chamblay is the devotion of the _vrais veneurs_; the Prince\r\nMurat and his son, the Prince Joachim, (to-day at the military school at\r\nSaint Cyr), the Prince Eugene Murat, the Comte de Vallon, the Baron de\r\nNeuflize and a few famous _veneurs_ in gay uniforms come from afar to\r\ngive eclat to the hunt of the master. And the ladies: the following\r\nnames are of those devoted to the prowess of the Prince Murat--Madame la\r\nPrincesse, la Princesse Marguerite Murat, Mademoiselle d'Elchingen, the\r\nDuchesse and the Marquise d'Albufera, the Duchesse de Camestra, and\r\nMadame Kraft.\r\n\r\nFrom this one sees that romance is not all smouldering. If other proof\r\nwere wanting a perusal of that most complete and interesting account of\r\nthe hunt in France in modern times, \"_Les Chasses de Rambouillet_\"\r\n(_Ouvrage offert par Monsieur Felix Faure_) would soon establish it.\r\nThis was not a work destined for the public at large. The hunt was ever\r\na sport of kings in France, and though France has become Republican its\r\n_Chasse Nationale_ at Rambouillet partakes not a little of the aspect of\r\nthose courtly days when there was less up-to-dateness and more\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rendezvous de Chasse, Rambouillet_]\r\n\r\nThere were but one hundred copies of this work printed for the friends\r\nof the late president of the Republic--\"Other Sovereigns,\" as the\r\ndedication reads, \"Princes, Grand Dukes, Ambassadors.\"\r\n\r\nRambouillet was the theatre of the most splendid hunts of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and down through the ages it has ever held a preeminent place;\r\nholds it to-day even. Louis XVI in the Revolutionary torment even\r\nregretted the cutting off of his prerogative of the royal hunt, but he\r\nhad no choice in the matter. In his journal of 1789 one reads: \"the cerf\r\nruns alone in the Parc en Bas\" (Rambouillet), and again in 1790: \"Seance\r\nof the National Assembly at noon; Audience of a deputation in the\r\nafternoon. The deer plentiful at Gambayseuil.\"\r\n\r\nThe Revolution felled many French institutions; low, great,\r\necclesiastical and monarchial monuments, the trees of the forest, and\r\nthe royal game, by a system of poaching, had become greatly diminished\r\nin quantity.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century, so frankly democratic in its latter years, was\r\nless favourable to the hunt than the monarchial days which had gone\r\nbefore. It had a considerable prominence under Charles X, more perhaps\r\nthan it ever had under Napoleon, who in his infancy and laborious\r\nadolescence had few opportunities of following it; and in the later\r\nyears of his life he was too busy.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III was not really a \"good hunter,\" though he was something of\r\na marksman and took a considerable pride in his skill in that\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nEntering the democratic era, Jules Grevy seems to have been only a\r\npot-hunter of the _bourgeoisie_, who practiced the art only because he\r\nwanted a jugged hare for his dinner, or again simply to kill time.\r\n\r\nSadi-Carnot was still less a hunter of the romantic school, but assisted\r\nfrequently at the ceremonial shootings which were arranged for visiting\r\nmonarchs. On one occasion he was put down on the record-sheet of a hunt\r\nat Rambouillet as responsible only for the death of eighteen heads,\r\nwhilst a visiting Grand Duke pulled down a hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nIt was notably during the presidency of Felix Faure that Rambouillet\r\nagain took on its animation of former times. The chateau had been\r\nfurbished up once more after a long sleep, and, to the great\r\nsatisfaction of the inhabitants of the town, there were more comings and\r\ngoings than there had been for a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nIn the summer and autumn the president made Rambouillet his preferred\r\nresidence, and there received many visiting sovereigns and notables of\r\nall ranks. In one year a score of \"Official Hunts\" were held, to which\r\nall the members of the diplomatic corps were invited, while there were\r\ntwo or three affairs of an \"International\" character in honour of\r\nvisiting sovereigns.\r\n\r\nAll was under the control of the Grand Veneur of the Third Republic, the\r\nComte de Girardin, and while a truly royal flavour may have been lacking\r\nthe general aspect was much the same as it might have been in the days\r\nof the monarchy. The Captain of the Hunt under Felix Faure was the\r\nInspector of Forests, Leddet, and the Premier Veneur was the Commandant\r\nLagarenne.\r\n\r\nThe president himself was a marksman of the first rank, and never was\r\nthere a reckoning up of the _tableau_ but that he was near the head of\r\nthe list. So accomplished was he with the rifle that on more than one\r\noccasion he was obliged to practically efface himself in favour of some\r\nvisiting monarch, as it was said he did in the case of the King of\r\nPortugal in 1895, the Grand Ducs Vladimir and Nicolas in 1896.\r\n\r\nHuntsmen not royal by virtue of title, or alliance, the Republican\r\npresident beat to a stand-still. He had no pity nor favour for a mere\r\nambassador, whether he hailed from England or Germany, nor for members\r\nof the Institute, Senators nor Deputies. With Prince Albert of Monaco\r\nhe held himself equal, and for every bird shot on the wing by the head\r\nof the house of Grimaldi the \"longshoreman\" of Havre brought down\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n_La chasse a courre_ before the law in France to-day may be practiced\r\nonly under strictly laid down conditions. The huntsman must legally have\r\nhis dogs under such control, and keep sufficiently close to them, as to\r\nbe able to recover the quarry immediately after it has been closed in\r\nupon by the hounds.\r\n\r\nLike shooting, since the Decree of 1844, hunting with hounds may only be\r\nundertaken under authority of a _permis de chasse_, and in open season,\r\nduring the daytime, and with the consent of the owners over whose\r\nproperties the hunt is to be held.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of the hunt in France now follows the traditions of the\r\nclassic hunt of the monarchy. The _veneur_ decides on the rendezvous,\r\nwhether the quarry be stag or chevreuil, fox or hare. The _piqueur_\r\nfollows close up with the dogs, sets them on or calls them off, and\r\nrecalls them if they go off on a false scent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PALAIS DE LA CITE AND TOURNELLES\r\n\r\n\r\nNot every one assumes the Paris Palais de Justice to ever have been the\r\nhome of kings and queens. It has not, however, always been a tilting\r\nground for lawyers and criminals, though, no doubt, when one comes to\r\nthink of it, it is in that role that it has acted its most thrilling\r\nepisodes.\r\n\r\nThe Saint Chapelle, the Conciergerie and the great clock of the Tour de\r\nl'Horloge mark the Palais de Justice down in the books of most folk as\r\none of the chief Paris \"sights,\" but it was as a royal residence that it\r\nfirst came into prominence.\r\n\r\nThis palace, not the conglomerate half-secular, half-religious pile of\r\nto-day, but an edifice of some considerable importance, existed from the\r\nearliest days of the Frankish invasion, and when occupied by Clotilde,\r\nthe wife of Clovis, was known as the Palais de la Cite.\r\n\r\nUnder the last of the kings of the First Race this palace took on really\r\nsplendid proportions. When Hugues Capet arrived on the throne he\r\nabandoned the kingly residence formerly occupied by the Frankish rulers,\r\nthe Palais des Thermes, and installed his goods and chattels in this\r\nPalais de la Cite, which his son Robert had rebuilt under the direction\r\nof Enguerrand de Marigny.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Francis I it remained the preferred residence of the\r\nFrench monarchs, regardless of the grander, more luxuriously disposed\r\nLouvre, which had come into being.\r\n\r\nPhilippe Auguste, by a contrary caprice, would transact no kingly\r\nbusiness elsewhere, and it was within the walls of this palace that he\r\nmarried Denmark's daughter. His successors, Saint Louis,\r\nPhilippe-le-Hardi, and Philippe-le-Bel did their part in enlarging and\r\nbeautifying the structure, and Saint Louis laid the foundations of that\r\npeerless Gothic gem--La Saint Chapelle.\r\n\r\nFrom the windows of the Palais de la Cite another Charles assisted at an\r\nofficial massacre, differing little from that of Saint Bartholemew's,\r\nwhich was conducted from the Louvre.\r\n\r\nOn the first floor of the Palais de Justice of to-day is the apartment\r\npaved in a mosaic of black and white marble, with a painted and gilded\r\nwooden vaulting, where Charles V received the Emperor Charles IV and the\r\n\"Roi des Romains.\" The three monarchs, accompanied by their families,\r\nhere supped together around a great round marble table, a secret supper\r\nprolific of an _entente cordiale_ which must have been the forerunner of\r\nrecent ceremonies of a similar nature in France.\r\n\r\nKnown as the Salle de Marbre, this great chamber came later to be the\r\nTribunal where the courts sat. It was only after the death of Charles\r\nVI, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, that the Palais de la\r\nCite was given over wholly to the disciples of Saint Yves, the judges,\r\nadvocates and notaries. It became also the definite seat of the\r\nParliament and took the nomenclature of Palais de Justice, though still\r\ninhabited at intermittent intervals by French royalties. One such\r\nnotable occasion was that when Henry V of England was here married to\r\nCatherine de France, and when Henry VI of England took up his temporary\r\nresidence here as king to the French.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century the precincts of the Palais de la Cite--the\r\nopen courtyard one assumes is meant--were invaded by the stalls of small\r\nshopkeepers, some of which actually took root in wood and stone and\r\nbecame fixtures to such an extent that the courtyard was known as the\r\nGalerie des Merciers.\r\n\r\nThe great marble chamber after becoming the meeting place of the\r\nTribunal played a part at times dignified and at others banal. An\r\nincident is recorded where the clerks and minor court officials danced\r\non the famous marble table and \"played farces\" with the judicial bench\r\nserving as a stage. It was said that, on account of the immoralities\r\nwhich they represented, the authorities were obliged to suppress the\r\nperformances by law, as they have in recent years the flagrant freedom\r\nof the \"Quat'z Arts.\"\r\n\r\nUp to the times of Francis I but few events of importance unrolled\r\nthemselves within the Palais de la Cite, but in 1618 a violent\r\nconflagration broke out leaving only the round towers of the\r\nConciergerie, the tower and the church, and that part of the main\r\nstructure which housed the great Salle de Marbre, unharmed. Apropos of\r\nthis, a joyous rhymester of the time made the following quatrain:\r\n\r\n   \"Certes ce fut un triste jeu\r\n   Quand a Paris Dame Justice\r\n   Pour avoir mange trop d'epice\r\n   Se mit le Palais tout en feu.\"\r\n\r\nJacques Debrosse was charged with rebuilding the edifice after the fire\r\nand refitted first the Grand Salle, to-day the famous Salle des Pas\r\nPerdus, crowded with the shuffling coming and going crowd of men and\r\nwomen whose business, or no business at all, brings them to this central\r\npoint for the dissemination of legal gossip. It is a magnificent\r\napartment, and, to no great extent, differs from what it was before the\r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\nThis Salle consists of two parallel naves separated by a range of\r\narcades and lighted by two great circular openings with four\r\nround-headed windows at either end. Its attributes are practically the\r\nsame as they were in 1622. The structure, take it as a whole, may be\r\nsaid to date only from the seventeenth century, but certain it is that\r\nthe old Palais de la Cite is incorporated therein, every stone of it,\r\nand if its career was humdrum that was the fault of circumstances rather\r\nthan from any inherent faults of its own.\r\n\r\nThe Conciergerie, that inelegant, inconsistent architectural mixture of\r\nthe ancient and modern, considered apart, though it properly enough is\r\nusually considered with the Palais de Justice, was formerly the dwelling\r\nor guardhouse of the Concierge of the Palais de la Cite. His post was\r\nnot merely that of the keeper of the gates; he was a personage at court\r\nand was as autocratic as his more plebeian contemporaries of to-day, for\r\nthe Paris concierge, as we, who have for years lived under their\r\ndespotism well know, is a very dreadful person.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being the governor of the royal dwelling this concierge\r\nwas the guardian of the royal prisoners. In 1348 he was further invested\r\nwith the official title of Bailli and the post was, at times, occupied\r\nby the highest and the most noble in the land, among others Philippe de\r\nSavoie, the friend of Charles VI, and Juvenal des Oursins, the historian\r\nof this prince. The first to combine the two functions, that of Bailli\r\nand Concierge, was Jacques Coictier, the doctor of Louis XI.\r\n\r\nAs a virtual prison the Conciergerie only came to be transformed when\r\nCharles V quitted the residence of the Palais de la Cite, and the\r\nConciergerie, as such, only figures on the Tournelles registers under\r\ndate of 1391.\r\n\r\nThe fire of the latter part of the eighteenth century destroyed a large\r\npart of the building, but enough remained to patch together the most\r\nserviceable of Revolutionary prisons, for at one time it held at least\r\ntwelve hundred poor souls, of whom two hundred and eighty-eight were\r\nkilled off at one fell blow.\r\n\r\nBut one woman among them all actually came to her death within the\r\nprison walls. This was La Belle Bouquetiere of the Palais Royal who, in\r\nan access of jealous furor, horribly mutilated a royal guardsman, and\r\nfor this met a most cruel death by being transfixed to a post and\r\nsubmitting to a trial of \"_le fer et le feu_.\" In just what manner the\r\npunishment was applied one can best imagine for himself.\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary role of the Conciergerie is a thing apart from the\r\npurport of this book, hence is not further referred to.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the time of Francis I, among the famous prisoners of state\r\nwere Louis de Berquin, the Comte de Mongomere, the regicides Ravaillac\r\nand Damiens, the Marechal d'Ancre, Cartouche, Mandrin and others.\r\nTo-day, as a prison, the Conciergerie still performs its functions\r\nacceptably, safeguarding those up for the assizes, and those condemned\r\nto death before being sent on their long journey.\r\n\r\nThe three great flanking towers of the Conciergerie are its chief\r\narchitectural distinction to-day. That of the left, the largest, is the\r\nTour d'Argent, that of the middle, the Tour Bonchet, and the third, the\r\nTour de Cesar or the Tour de l'Horloge. This last is the only one which\r\nhas preserved its mediaeval crenulated battlements aloft. The great clock\r\nhas been commonly considered the largest timepiece of its kind extant,\r\nbut it is doubtful if this now holds good with railways and insurance\r\ncompanies vying with each other to furnish the hour so legibly that he\r\nwho runs may read.\r\n\r\nAcross the Pont au Change, from the Palais de la Cite, by the Louvre and\r\nout into the Faubourg Saint Antoine, one comes to the Place des Vosges,\r\nthe old Place Royale, which occupies almost the same area as was covered\r\nby the courtyard of the Palais des Tournelles, so called from its many\r\ntowers.\r\n\r\nAll around the Palais des Tournelles was located a series of splendid\r\n_hotels prives_ of the nobility. In one of these, the Hotel de Saint\r\nPol, the king once lodged twenty-two visiting princes of the quality of\r\nDauphin (the eldest son of a ruling monarch), their suites and\r\ndomestics.\r\n\r\nCharles V in his time amalgamated with his royal palace three of these\r\nmagnificent private dwellings, the Hotel du Petit Musc, the Hotel de\r\nl'Abbe de Saint Maur and the Hotel du Comte d'Etampes.\r\n\r\nThe palace proper really faced on what is now the Rue Saint Antoine,\r\nopposite the Hotel Saint Pol. Its historic and romantic memories of the\r\nsword and cloak period of gallantry were many, but the edifice was\r\ndemolished by the order of Catherine de Medici.\r\n\r\nIn the palace Charles VI was confined, during the period of his\r\ninsanity, by order of the cruel Isabeau de Baviere. The Duke of Bedford,\r\nwhen regent for the minor Henry VI, lodged here, and upon the expulsion\r\nof the English it became the residence of Charles VII. Louis XI and\r\nLouis XII each inhabited it, and the latter died within its walls.\r\n\r\nThe Palais des Tournelles will go down to history chiefly because of\r\nthat celebrated jousting bout held in its courtyard on the marriage day\r\nof the two princesses, Elizabeth and Marguerite.\r\n\r\nHenri II and the elder princes, his sons, were to ride forth in\r\ntournament and break lances, if possible, with all comers. The court,\r\nincluding Catherine de Medici and the princess Elizabeth, wife of\r\nPhilippe II, the late husband of Mary Tudor, the two Marguerites and\r\nother high personages were seated on a dais upholstered in damascened\r\nsilk and ornamented with many-coloured streamers.\r\n\r\nThe time was July and the morning. At a signal from Catherine music\r\nburst forth and the bouts began.\r\n\r\nThe king rode forth at the head of his chevaliers, wearing a suit of\r\ngolden armour, his sword handle set with jewels, and, in spite of the\r\npresence of his wife, his lance flying black and white streamers, the\r\ncolours of Diane de Poitiers, who had lately turned her affections from\r\nfather unto son.\r\n\r\nA herald proclaimed the opening of the combat, and before night the king\r\nhad broken the lances of the Ducs de Ferrare, de Guise, and de Nemours,\r\nand was just about disarming when a masked knight approached from the\r\nFaubourg Saint Antoine and challenged the king, who, in spite of being\r\nimplored to desist by his queen, entered the lists again and was\r\nultimately wounded unto death by the sable knight.\r\n\r\nHenri II expired the same night in a bedchamber of the Palais des\r\nTournelles, whither he had been carried, at the age of forty-one, the\r\nvictim of chance, or the wile of the Sieur de Montgomeri, the ancestor\r\nof England's present Earl of Eglinton. The captain of the Scotch Guards,\r\nMontgomeri, was not immediately pursued (he meantime had fled the\r\ncourt), but Catherine de Medici harboured for him a most bitter rancour.\r\nPro and con ran his cause, for he had his partisans, but the Marechal de\r\nMatignon finally caught up with him in Normandy and he was tortured and\r\ncondemned to death for the crime of _lese majeste_--beating the king at\r\nhis own game.\r\n\r\nThe widowed queen angrily ordered Diane de Poitiers from the court, and\r\ncaused the Palais des Tournelles to be razed. This was her only means of\r\nshowing her contempt for the woman who had played her royal spouse to\r\nhis death as the Romans played the gladiators of old; and Tournelles, as\r\na palatial monument of its time, blotted out the rest when it\r\ndisappeared from view.\r\n\r\nA forest of spirelets soared aloft from the gables and rooftrees of the\r\nPalais des Tournelles. There was no spectacle of the time more imposing\r\nthan this sky-line silhouette of a Paris palace; not at Chambord nor\r\nChenonceaux was the spectacle more fine. It was like a fairy castle,\r\nalbeit that it was in the heart of a great city.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the Palais des Tournelles, beyond the Porte Saint\r\nAntoine, was the ink-black, frowning donjon of the Bastille, its\r\nseverity in strong contrast with the more luxurious palaces of the\r\nprinces which surrounded it not far away.\r\n\r\nThe charming Place des Vosges, which occupies the site of Tournelles\r\nto-day, is another of Paris's breathing spaces. Well may it be called a\r\nroyal garden--a park virtually on a diminutive scale--since it was\r\noriginally known as the Place Royale, under Henri IV.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the gascon Henri de Bearn this delightful little\r\nunspoiled corner of old Paris took on the aspect which it now has.\r\nWithin this enclosure were the usual garden or park attributes, more or\r\nless artificially disposed, but making an ideal open-air playground for\r\nthe court, shut in from outside surroundings by the outlines of the old\r\npalace walls, and not too far away from the royal palace of the Louvre.\r\n\r\nThe first and greatest historic souvenir of this garden was a Carrousel\r\ngiven in 1612, by Marie de Medici, two years after the tragic death of\r\nHenri IV, celebrating the alliance between France and Spain. Under\r\nRichelieu the square became known as the Place des Vosges, and, in spite\r\nof the law against duelling, which had by this time come into force, it\r\nbecame a celebrated meeting place for duellists like Ivry, the \"Grand'\r\nRoue\" or the \"Vel' Hiver\" of to-day.\r\n\r\nIt was on May 12, 1627, that the Comte des Chappell killed Bussy\r\nd'Amboise on this spot, and left a bloody souvenir, which was only\r\nforgotten by the historians when they had to recount another meeting,\r\nthis time between the Catholic Duc de Guise and the Protestant Coligny\r\nd'Andelot.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said the duke, \"we will now proceed to settle that little\r\naccount between our illustrious houses,\" and with that he drew his\r\nsword and killed Coligny, as if he were but stamping the life out of a\r\ncaterpillar.\r\n\r\nNow, with all this bloody memory behind, the Place became one of the\r\nmost elegant residential quarters of the capital, preferred above all by\r\nthe nobility, the Rohans, the Alegres and Rotroux.\r\n\r\nAt No. 21 lived Victor Hugo, just before the Coup d'Etat, in the house\r\nfirst made famous as the habitation of the somewhat infamous Marion\r\nDelorme.\r\n\r\nAmong other illustrious names who have given a brilliance to these\r\nalleyed walks and corridors are to be recalled Corneille, Conde, Saint\r\nVincent de Paul, Moliere, Turenne, Madame de Longueville, De Thou,\r\nCinq-Mars, Richelieu, D'Ormesson, the Prince de Talmon, the Marquis de\r\nTesse and the Comte de Chabanne.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this charming Paris square will remain as ever it\r\nhas been, for a recent attempt of the owner of one of the houses which\r\nborders upon it to change the disposition of the facade brought about a\r\nlaw-suit which compelled him to respect the procedure which obtained in\r\n1605 when it was ordained the Place Royale.\r\n\r\nTo prove their rights the civic authorities had recourse to the original\r\nplans still preserved in the national archives. This is a demonstration\r\nof how carefully European nations preserve the written records of their\r\npasts.\r\n\r\nThe decision finally arrived at by the courts--that the Place des Vosges\r\nmust be kept intact as originally planned--gave joy to the hearts of all\r\ntrue Parisians and archeologists alike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF OLD PARIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE OLD LOUVRE AND ITS HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nA stroll by the banks of the Seine will review much of the history of\r\nthe capital, as much of it as was bound up with Notre Dame, the Louvre\r\nand the Palais de la Cite (now the Palais de Justice), and that was a\r\ngreat deal, even in mediaeval and Renaissance times.\r\n\r\nThe life of the Louvre was Paris; the life of Paris that of the nation;\r\nand the life of the nation that of the people. This even the Parisians\r\nof to-day will tell you. It is scant acknowledgment of the provinces to\r\nbe sure, but what would you? The French capital is much more the capital\r\nof France than London is of England, or Washington of America--leaving\r\npolitics out of the question.\r\n\r\nParis before the conquest by the Franks was practically only the\r\nSeine-surrounded isle known as Lutetia, and later as \"La Cite,\" and the\r\nslight overflow which crept up the slopes of the Montagne de la Sainte\r\nGenevieve. From the Chatelet to the Louvre was a damp, murky swamp\r\ncalled, even in the moyen-age, Les Champeaux, meaning the Little Fields,\r\nbut swampy ones, as inferred by studying the evolution of the name still\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nA rapid rivulet descended from Menilmontant and mingled with the Seine\r\nsomewhere near the Garden of the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nClovis and his Franks attacked the city opposite the isle, and, upon the\r\nactual achievement of their conquest, threw up an entrenched camp on the\r\napproved Roman plan in what is now the courtyard of the old Louvre, and\r\nfilled the moat with the waters of this rivulet. The ensemble was,\r\naccording to certain authorities, baptized the Louvre, or Lower, meaning\r\na fortified camp. This entrenchment was made necessary in order that the\r\nFranks might sustain themselves against the Gallo-Roman occupants of\r\nLutetia, and in time enabled them to acquire the whole surrounding\r\nregion for their own dominion. This the Lower, or Louvre, made possible,\r\nand it is well deserved that its name should be thus perpetuated, though\r\nactually the origin of the name is in debate, as will be seen by a\r\nfurther explanation which follows.\r\n\r\nLittle by little this half-barbaric camp--in contradistinction to the\r\nmore solid works of the Romans--became a _placefort_, then a chateau,\r\nthen a palace and, finally, as the young lady tourist said, an art\r\nmuseum. Well, at any rate, it was a dignified evolution.\r\n\r\nTwo Louvres disappeared before the crystallization of the present rather\r\nirregularly cut gem. From the Merovingians dates the Louvre des Champs,\r\nthe hostile, militant Louvre, with its high wood and stone tower,\r\nfamiliar only in old engravings. After this the moyen-age Louvre,\r\nattributable to Saint Louis and Charles V, with its great tower, its\r\nthick walls of stone and its deep-dug moats, came into being. With\r\nFrancis I came a more sympathetic, a more subtle era of architectural\r\ndisplay, a softening of outlines and an interpolation of flowering\r\ngables. It was thus that was born that noble monument known as the New\r\nLouvre, which combined all the arts and graces of a fastidious ambition.\r\n\r\nNothing remains of the old Louverie (to which the name had become\r\ncorrupted) which Philippe Auguste early in the thirteenth century caused\r\nto be turned into an ambitious quadrangular castle from a somewhat more\r\nhumble establishment which had evolved itself on the site of the\r\nFrankish camp, save the white marble outline sunken in the pavement of\r\nthe courtyard of the palace of to-day. By destiny this palace, set down\r\nin the very heart of Paris, was to dominate everything round about.\r\nFrom the date of its birth, and since that time, it has had no rivals\r\namong Paris or suburban palaces. Its very situation compelled the\r\nplaying of an auspicious part, and the Seine flowing swiftly by its\r\nramparts added no small charm to the fetes and ceremonies of both the\r\nLouvre and the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nNever was a great river so allied with the life of a royal capital;\r\nnever a stream so in harmony with other civic beauties as is the Seine\r\nwith Paris. When Henri II entered Paris after his Sacrament he\r\ncontemplated a water-festival on the Seine, which was to extend from the\r\nwalls of the Louvre to the towers of Notre Dame, a festival with such\r\nelaborate decorations as had never been known in the French capital.\r\n\r\nThe kings of France after their Sacrament entered the Louvre by the\r\nquay-side entrance, followed by their cortege of gayly caparisoned\r\ncavaliers and gilded coaches with personages of all ranks in doublet and\r\nrobe, cape and doublet. The scintillating of gold lace and burnished\r\ncoats gave a brilliance which rivalled that of the sun.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the cavalcade entered the gates of the Louvre than it came\r\nout again to participate in the day and night festival, which had the\r\nbosom of the Seine for its stage and its bridges and banks for the act\r\ndrop and the wings.\r\n\r\nThe receptions of Ambassadors, the baptisms of royalties, royal\r\nmarriages and celebrations of victories, or treaties, were all feted in\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\nNapoleon glorified the Peace of Amiens under similar conditions, and\r\nthere is scarce a chronicler of any reign but that recounts the part\r\nplayed by the Seine in the ceremonies of the court of the New and Old\r\nLouvre.\r\n\r\nIt was amid a setting which lent itself so readily to all this that the\r\nOld Louvre, which was rebuilt by Francis I, first came to its glory.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name Louvre has still other interpretation from that\r\npreviously given. It seems to be a question of grave doubt among the\r\nsavants, but because the note is an interesting one it is here\r\nreproduced. The name may have been derived as well from the word\r\n_oeuvre_, from the Latin _opus_; it may have been evolved from\r\n_lupara_, or _louverie_ (place of wolves), which seems improbable. It\r\nmay have had its evolution from either one of these origins, or it may\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAnglo-Saxons may be proud of the fact that certain French savants have\r\nacknowledged that the name of the most celebrated of all Paris palaces\r\nis a derivation from a word belonging to their tongue and meaning\r\nhabitation. This, then, is another version and one may choose that which\r\nis most to his liking, or may go back and show his preference for\r\n_lower_, meaning a fortified place.\r\n\r\nA palace--something more elaborate than a mere habitation--stood on the\r\nsame site in the twelfth century, a work which, under the energies of\r\nPhilippe Auguste, in 1204 began to grow to still more splendid\r\nproportions, though infinitesimal one may well conclude as compared with\r\nthe mass which all Paris knows to-day under the inclusive appellation of\r\n\"The Louvre.\"\r\n\r\nThe Paris of Philippe Auguste was already a city of a hundred and twenty\r\nthousand inhabitants, with mean houses on every side and little pretense\r\nat even primitive comforts or conveniences. This far-seeing monarch laid\r\nhand first on the great citadel tower of the fortified _lower_, added to\r\nits flanking walls and built a circling rampart around the capital\r\nitself. It is recounted that the rumbling carts, sinking deep in mud and\r\nplowing through foot-deep dust beneath the palace windows, annoyed the\r\nmonarch so much that he instituted what must have been the first city\r\npaving work on record, and commanded that all the chief thoroughfares\r\npassing near the Louvre should be paved with cobbles. This was real\r\nmunicipal improvement. He was a Solon among his kind for, since that\r\nday, it has been a _sine qua non_ that for the well-keeping of city\r\nstreets they must be paved, and, though cobblestones have since gone out\r\nof fashion, it was this monarch who first showed us how to do it.\r\n\r\nThe Louvre of Philippe Auguste was the most imposing edifice of the\r\nParis of its time. To no little extent was this imposing outline due to\r\nits great central tower, the _maitresse_, which was surrounded by\r\ntwenty-three _dames d'honneur_, without counting numberless _tourelles_.\r\nThis hydra-towered giant palace was the real guardian of the Paris of\r\nmediaevalism, as its successor is indeed the real centre of the Paris of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe city was but an immense mass of low-lying gable-roofed houses, whose\r\ncrowning apex was the sky-line of the Louvre, with that of Tournelles\r\nonly less prominent to the north, and that of La Cite hard by on the\r\nisland where the Palais de Justice and Notre Dame now stand.\r\n\r\nBefore the hand of Francis fell upon the Louvre it was but an isolated\r\nstronghold--a combined castle, prison and palace, gloomy, foreboding and\r\nsurrounded by moats and ramparts almost impassable. Philippe Auguste\r\nbuilt well and made of it an admirable and imposing castle and a place\r\nof defence, and a defence it was, and not much more.\r\n\r\nFor its time it was of great proportions and of an ideal situation from\r\na strategic point of view; far more so than the isolated Palais de la\r\nCite in the middle of the Seine.\r\n\r\nFour gates led out from the inner courtyard of the Old Louvre: one to\r\nthe Seine; one to the south, facing Saint Germain l'Auxerrois; another\r\ntowards the site of the later Tuileries; and the other to about where\r\nthe Rue Marengo cuts the Rue de Rivoli of to-day.\r\n\r\nWith the endorsement given it by Philippe Auguste the Louvre now became\r\nthe official residence of the kings of the Capetian race, whereas\r\npreviously they had dwelt but intermittently at Paris, chiefly in the\r\nPalais de la Cite.\r\n\r\nThe monarch, as if to test the efficiency of his new residence as a\r\nstronghold, made a dungeon tower, his greatest constructive achievement\r\nuntil he built the castle of Gisors, and in the tower imprisoned the\r\nComte de Flandre, whom he had taken prisoner at Bouvines. Louis IX\r\n(Saint Louis), in his turn, built a spacious annex to Philippe Auguste's\r\nLouvre, to which he attached his name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE XIV CENTURY LOUVRE]\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles V totally changed the aspect of the palace from what it had\r\nformerly been--half-fortress, half-residence--and made of it a veritable\r\npalace in truth as well as in name, by the addition of numerous\r\ndependencies.\r\n\r\nWithin a tower which was built during the reign of this monarch, called\r\nthe Tour de la Librairie, he assembled his royal bibelots and founded\r\nwhat was afterwards known as the Bibliotheque du Louvre, the egg from\r\nwhich was hatched the present magnificently endowed _Bibliotheque\r\nNationale_ in the Rue Richelieu.\r\n\r\nIt is related that in 1373 the valet-de-chambre of Charles V made a\r\ncatalogue of the nine hundred and ten volumes which formed this\r\ncollection, an immense number for the time when it is known that his\r\npredecessor, Jean-le-Bon, possessed but seven volumes of history and\r\nfour devotional books as his entire literary treasure.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a bibliographical note of interest which has hitherto\r\nbeen overlooked. Charles V was evidently a man of taste, or he would not\r\nhave built so well, though all is hearsay, as not a fragment remains of\r\nthe work upon which he spent his talents and energies.\r\n\r\nFrom the death of Charles V, in 1364, until 1557 the Louvre by some\r\ncaprice ceased to be a permanent royal residence. At the latter epoch\r\nthe ambitious, art-loving Francis I conceived the idea that here was a\r\nwealth of scaffolding upon which to graft some of his Renaissance\r\nluxuries and, by a process of \"restoration\" (perhaps an unfortunate word\r\nfor him to have employed, since it meant the razing of the fine tower\r\nbuilt by Charles V), added somewhat to the splendours thereof, though in\r\na fickle moment, as was his wont, allowed a gap of a dozen years to\r\nintervene between the outlining of his project and the terrifically\r\nearnest work which finally resulted in the magnificent structure\r\naccredited to him, though indeed it meant the demolition of the original\r\nedifice.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that Charles V entered into the ambitious part\r\nwhich Francis was to henceforth play in the Louvre, so perhaps the\r\ninterruption was pardonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE LOUVRE OF FRANCIS I AND ITS SUCCESSORS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne can attribute the demise of the Old Louvre to the coming of Charles\r\nV to Paris in 1539. This royal residence, hastily put in order to\r\nreceive his august presence, seemed so coldly inconvenient and\r\ninhospitable to his host, Francis I, that that monarch decided forthwith\r\nupon its complete reconstruction and enlargement. Owing to various\r\ncombinations of circumstances the actual work of reconstruction was put\r\noff until 1546, thus the New Louvre as properly belongs to the reign of\r\nHenri II as to that of his father.\r\n\r\nFrancis I, more than any other European monarch of his time, or, indeed,\r\nbefore or since, left his mark as an architect of supreme tastes over\r\nevery edifice with which he came into personal contact. His mania was\r\nfor building--when it was not for affairs of the heart--and so daring\r\nwas he that when he could not get an old fabric to remodel he would\r\nbrave all, as did Louis XIV at Versailles, and erect a dream palace in\r\nthe midst of a desert. This he did at Chambord in the Sologne. At Paris\r\nhis difficulties were perhaps no less, but he had his materials and his\r\nworkmen ready at hand.\r\n\r\nFrancis's repairs and embellishments to the Old Louvre were by no means\r\nperfunctory, but he saw possibilities greater than he was able to\r\nperform with the means at hand. He first razed the central tower, or\r\n_donjon_, and scarce before the departure of his royal guest, was\r\nalready dreaming of replacing the entire fabric with another which\r\nshould bear the same name. One has read of the monarch's thoughts when\r\nhe was awaiting the coming to Paris of his old enemy in the peninsula;\r\nhow he regretted the moment when he should sally out to meet him and\r\nleave his new-found friend, the Duchesse d'Etampes, in spite of her\r\npleadings for him to remain by her. All this is mere historic incident,\r\nand has little to do with Francis's art instincts and ambitions. He\r\nprobably thought this very thing himself when he replied to the\r\nimportunate lady: \"Duchesse, I must tear myself away without more ado; I\r\ngo to meet my brother monarch at Amboise on the Loire.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Francis I, the passionate lover of art, who collected the first\r\npictures which formed the foundation of the present collections of the\r\nMusee National du Louvre. He bought many in foreign parts, and many\r\nothers were brought from Italy by Italian artists, whom he had commanded\r\nto the capital: Primaticcio brought with him, upon his arrival, more\r\nthan a hundred antique statues. These art objects were first assembled\r\nat Fontainebleau and ornamented the apartments of the king. Among them\r\nwere Da Vinci's \"La Joconde\" and Raphael's \"Holy Family and Saint\r\nMichael.\"\r\n\r\nHenri II, Henri IV, and Louis XIII did little to enrich the art\r\ncollections of the palace, but Louis XIV charged his minister, Colbert,\r\nwith numerous purchases. In 1661 he bought the fine collection left by\r\nCardinal Mazarin, and ten years later purchased the contents of the\r\ncelebrated gallery belonging to the banker Jacob of Cologne. The state\r\nexpended for these acquisitions nearly six hundred thousand _livres_,\r\nand received for this sum six hundred paintings and six thousand\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that the royal collections were transferred to\r\nParis, a little before the death of Colbert, when they were placed in\r\nthe galleries of the Louvre; though it was a hundred years later that a\r\nnational museum was actually created. This was virtually brought about\r\nfrom the fact that the royal collections were transported in a great\r\npart to Versailles, only to be returned to Paris in 1750, transferred\r\nagain to Versailles, and ultimately to be returned to Paris under the\r\nsheltering wing of the grand old Louvre.\r\n\r\nThe Museum of the Louvre, the Museum National et Central des Arts, is\r\nthe outgrowth of a Decree of the Convention, dated July 27, 1793. It was\r\naided and enriched considerably under Napoleon I, that passionate lover\r\nof the beautiful, who, none too scrupulously, would even seek to \"make a\r\ncampaign\" in order to acquire art works for the museum of his capital.\r\n\r\nMany of these abducted art treasures (like the horses of Saint Marc, for\r\ninstance) were afterwards returned to their original owners, but the\r\nnucleus of this unrivaled art museum was chiefly due to the consul and\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Charles V had left the Louvre demolition was at once begun by\r\nFrancis, and in 1541 an Italian, Serlio, was bidden prepare a set of\r\nplans for the Renaissance glory that was to be. Serlio, refusing, or\r\ndebating the price, was cast aside for the Frenchman, Lescot, whose plan\r\nwas adopted.\r\n\r\nThe work can in no way be said to have suffered by the change of plans,\r\nfor though Pierre Lescot was as yet a name unknown in the world of\r\narchitecture his talents were sufficiently great, magistrate and\r\nparliamentary counsellor though he was, to give to Paris what has ever\r\nbeen accounted its chief Renaissance glory.\r\n\r\nWork was begun at once, a work which was not interrupted by intrigues of\r\ncourt, of love, of war, nor by the deaths of Francis I nor his\r\nsuccessor, Henri II.\r\n\r\nAlthough the work was begun in an energetic manner it was 1555 before\r\nthe western wing was ready for the hand of the sculptors, but from this\r\ntime on, judging from the interpolated monograms of Charles IX and Henri\r\nIV on the south wing, work progressed less hurriedly. The two other\r\nconstructions, which were to enclose the quadrangle to the north and\r\neast, were completed under such circumstances that there has never been\r\na question as to their period.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years the work went on, when suddenly it was abandoned as\r\nwere the plans of Lescot. A sole wing, that following the Seine and\r\nabutting at right angles against the Pavilion de l'Horloge, had\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nThe sculptures of its south facade, as well as certain of its interior\r\ndecorations, were entrusted to Jean Goujon (1520-1572), who became a\r\nvictim of the horrible night of Saint Bartholomew, planned in the same\r\nLouvre by the wily Medici.\r\n\r\nHenri II often dwelt over Lescot's plans and devices, and, on one\r\noccasion, when the poet Ronsard was present, demanded of the architect\r\nthe meaning of the decorations surrounding a great _oeil-de-boeuf_\r\nwindow, two kneeling figures, one blowing a trumpet, and the other\r\nextending a palm branch. \"Victory and Fame,\" replied Lescot. And, in\r\nhonour of the architect and his sentiment, Ronsard composed his\r\n\"Franciade.\" The detail was actually by Goujon, whose design it was,\r\nunder the oversight of the master architect. One may see this _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ to-day just above the courtyard portal to the west.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Henri II, Catherine de Medici came here to live alone,\r\nand built the great extension, which stands to-day and joins the Old\r\nLouvre with that portion along the banks of the Seine by the double\r\narch, through which swing the autobusses coming from the Rive Gauche\r\nwith such a Juggernaut grind that fears for the foundation of the palace\r\nare ever uppermost in the minds of those responsible for its\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Louvre_]\r\n\r\nIt is in this Catherine de Medici portion of the Louvre (1578) that the\r\npresent Galerie des Antiques is installed, and which is usually\r\nthronged, in season and out, with globe-trotting sight-seers who give\r\nseldom a thought to its constructive elegance and its association with\r\nthe Medici.\r\n\r\nWith the first years of the reign of Charles IX, there is to be remarked\r\na notable slowness of procedure with regard to the construction of the\r\nNew Louvre. This was brought about chiefly by the conception of the\r\nTuileries and the work which was actually begun thereon. Soon a gigantic\r\nidea radiated from the ambitious mind of Catherine de Medici. In this\r\nconnection it must be remembered, however, that Catherine, so commonly\r\nreviled as \"the Italian,\" was not all Italian; French blood flowed\r\nthrough her veins through that of her mother, Madeleine de la Tour\r\nd'Auvergne. She came first to France, landing at Marseilles, whence she\r\narrived from Leghorn, and forthwith commenced her journey Parisward,\r\narriving finally at the Louvre as the bride of Prince Henri in the guise\r\nof a simple, clever girl, though indeed she was twenty years the elder.\r\n\r\nNow she dreamed of uniting her chateau of the Tuileries with that of the\r\nking by a long, connecting gallery. She put action to the thought and\r\nunder Pierre (II) Chambiges, a relative of the Chambiges of\r\nFontainebleau and Saint Germain, the Petite Galerie, a mere means of\r\ncommunication between the two chateaux, and not the least to be likened\r\nto a defensive structure, was begun and work thereon carried out between\r\n1564 and 1571, though it remained for Thibaut Metezeau, in 1595-1596, to\r\ncarry it on a stage further under Henri IV.\r\n\r\nThis architect introduced the notorious mezzanine, which has so\r\nintrigued historians of the Louvre because of the unequal elevations of\r\nthe various floors, a procedure which was unavoidable save by recourse\r\nto a substitution less to be objected to than the existing fault.\r\nActually the connection with the Tuileries was made by the prolongation\r\nof this gallery by the Ducerceau brothers in 1595. The work existing\r\nto-day, but only in its reconstructed form, is the same as that\r\ncompleted by Napoleon III (1863-1868).\r\n\r\nCharles IX and Henri III, though making the Louvre their residence,\r\npractically had no hand in its embellishment. The former gave his\r\nenergies and ideals full play in the Saint Bartholomew massacres and\r\nshot at poor unfortunates who fled beneath the windows of his apartments\r\non the quay-side of the Louvre. This, if not the chief incident of his\r\nassociation with the fabric, is at least the best remembered one. Henri\r\nIII, too, led a scandalous life within the walls of the Louvre and fled\r\non horseback, smuggled out a back door, as it were, on a certain May\r\nevening in 1588, never more to return, for the Dominican monk Jacques\r\nClement killed him with a knife-thrust before he had got beyond Saint\r\nCloud.\r\n\r\nThe accepted tale of the part played by the famous window of the Louvre\r\nin the drama of Saint Bartholomew's night is as follows: As the signal\r\ntolled from the belfry of Saint Germain l'Auxerrois it was answered by\r\nanother peal from the great bell of the Palais de Justice, where, within\r\na small apartment over the watergate of the Louvre, the queen and her\r\ntwo sons were huddled together not knowing what might happen next. The\r\nmultitude streamed by on the quay before the palace, and, finally, amid\r\nall the horror of Coligny's murder, and the throwing of his body from a\r\nwindow of the Louvre to the street below, Charles IX stood at his window\r\nregarding the fleeing Huguenots as so much small game, shooting away at\r\nthem with an arquebuse as they went by, and with an unholy glee, even\r\nboasting that he had killed a score of heretics in a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nHistorians of those exciting times were perhaps none too faithful\r\nchroniclers and Charles's \"excellent shots\" in his \"royal hunt,\" and\r\nhideous oaths and threats such as: \"We'll have them all, even the women\r\nand children,\" are not details as well authenticated as we would like to\r\nhave them. Like Rizzio's blood stains they lack conviction.\r\n\r\nThe ambitious white-plumed Henri de Navarre, when he became Henri IV of\r\nFrance, set about to connect the tentacle which stretched southward from\r\nthe Old Louvre with the Tuileries (a continuation of the project of\r\nCatherine de Medici), and, by the end of the sixteenth century, had\r\nbuilt a long facade under the advice of the brothers Ducerceau. This\r\nwork was added to on the courtyard side under the Second Empire, when a\r\nreconstruction, more likely a strengthening of underpinning and walls\r\nbecause of their proximity to the swift-flowing waters of the Seine, of\r\nthe work of Henri IV was undertaken.\r\n\r\nJoining the Tuileries and this work of Ducerceau was the celebrated\r\nPavilion de Flore, a work of the Henri IV period rather than that of\r\nCatherine de Medici.\r\n\r\nFrom the Pavilion de Flore to the Pavilion de Lesdiguieres ran this long\r\ngallery of the Ducerceau and numerous interstices and unfinished vaults\r\nand arches leading towards the Old Louvre were, at this epoch, completed\r\nby Metezeau and Dupaira. The chief apartment of this structure became\r\nknown as the _Galerie Henri IV_, and was completed in 1608.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Henri IV, Richelieu, who at times builded so well, and\r\nwho at others was a base destroyer of monuments, demolished that portion\r\nwhich remained of the edifice of Charles V. The work of Pierre Lescot\r\nwas preserved, however, and to give symmetry and an additional extent of\r\navailable space the rectangle facing Saint Germain l'Auxerrois to-day\r\nwas completed, thus enclosing in one corner of its ample courtyard the\r\nfoundations of the earlier work whose outlines are plainly traced in the\r\npavement that those who view may build anew--if they can--the old\r\nstructure of Philippe Auguste. In mere magnitude the present quadrangle\r\nis something more than four times the extent of the Louvre of the time\r\nof Charles V.\r\n\r\nThis courtyard of the Louvre is perhaps that spot in all Paris which\r\npresents the greatest array of Renaissance art treasures. From ground to\r\nsky-line the facades are embroidered by the works from the magic hand of\r\nthe _Siecle Italien_. Jean Goujon himself has left his brilliant\r\nsouvenirs on all sides, caryatides, festoons, bas-reliefs, statues and\r\ncolonnades.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm and devotion knew no bounds among those old craftsmen, but\r\nall is well-ordered, regular and correct. \"He who mentions the Louvre to\r\na Frenchman gives a greater pleasure than that of Mehemet-Ali when one\r\npraises the pyramids.\" In a way the Louvre is the most magnificent\r\nedifice in the universe; \"four palaces one piled up on another, _une\r\nville entiere_.\" And when the Louvre was linked with the Tuileries in\r\nthe real, what a splendour it must have been for former generations to\r\nmarvel at! \"_La plus belle et la plus grande chose sous le soleil._\"\r\n\r\nThis work of aggrandizement of the quadrangle was carried out by the\r\narchitect Lemercier on the basis of a project adopted in 1642, and, to a\r\ngreat extent, completed before the arrival of Anne d'Autriche, twenty\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nThis queenly personage had ideas of her own as to what sort of a\r\nresidence she would have in Paris, and beyond her personal needs little\r\nwas done for the moment towards actually linking up the various loose\r\nends, each more or less complete in itself, which now composed the Paris\r\npalace of the French monarchs.\r\n\r\nHer son, the king in person if not in power, was not likely to be\r\nendowed with instincts which would put him in the rank of the\r\ntraditional castle or palace builders of his race; it was literature,\r\nmusic and painting which more particularly flourished during his reign,\r\nand so the Austrian contented herself at first with merely putting the\r\nformer apartments of Catherine de Medici into condition for her personal\r\nuse and building a Salle-de-Spectacle, and--happy thought--a\r\nSalle-des-Bains.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV, as he found time, after the war of the Fronde, actually did\r\nbethink himself of completing, in a way, the work of his elders, and\r\ncharged the architect Levau to finish off the north wing, which was done\r\nin 1660. A year later the Galerie Henri IV was practically destroyed by\r\nfire and rebuilt by Levau, who gave the commission for its interior\r\ndecoration to Lebrun.\r\n\r\nSoon the south wing was completed, leaving only the gap for the eastern\r\nfacade which was intended to be the chief entrance to the mass of\r\nbuildings, which still bore the comprehensive name of \"The Louvre.\"\r\n\r\nFor the accomplishment of this facade, the demolition of certain\r\ndwellings of the nobility which had clustered around the royal fabric\r\nwas necessary, and the Hotels du Petit Bourbon, de Villequier, de\r\nChaumont, La Force, De Crequy, de Longueville, and de Choisy fell before\r\nthe picks of the house-breakers. Levau commenced work on the facade at\r\nonce, and made rapid progress until 1664, when an abrupt order came for\r\nhim to stop all work. Political conspiracy, graft, if you like, was at\r\nwork, and Colbert, little favourable towards Levau, made a proposition\r\nto the king to open a competition for the design and execution of the\r\nfacade. Willingly enough, his mind doubtless more occupied with other\r\nthings, Louis XIV agreed, and a general call was sent out to all French\r\narchitects to enter the lists. Confusion reigned, and Levau was about to\r\nbe recalled when Colbert spied an unrolled parchment in the corner and\r\npounced upon it eagerly as the means of saving him from the dubious\r\nefforts of the former incumbent.\r\n\r\nIt was the \"non-professional\" plan submitted by a doctor in medicine,\r\none Charles Perrault. Jealous competitors made all sorts of criticisms\r\nand objections, the chief contention being that if by any chance an\r\narchitectural design by a \"pill-roller\" proved pleasing to the eye it\r\nwas bound to be impracticable from an economic or constructive point of\r\nview, or both. This is often enough true, and it proved to be so in this\r\ncase, for in spite of a certain amount of advice from an expert Italian\r\nbuilder, who had come to Paris to help the good doctor with his\r\ndifficult task (for he actually received a commission for the work and\r\ncompleted it in 1674), the facade did not fit the rest of the fabric\r\nwith which it was intended to join up, and to-day it may be observed by\r\nthe curious as being several feet out of line with the structure which\r\nfaces on the Rue de Rivoli.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV practically had no regard for the Louvre and its architectural\r\ntraditions; his palatial garden-city idea, worked out at Versailles,\r\nshows what an innovator he was. He allowed the Louvre to be filled up\r\nwith all sorts of riffraff, who were often given a lodging there in\r\nplace of a money payment for some service rendered. The Louvre thus\r\nbecame a sort of genteel poor-house, while king and court spent their\r\ntime in the more ample country-house behind the Meudon hills.\r\n\r\nBy 1750 the Louvre had become little more than an immense ruin, humbled\r\nand desecrated; a veritable orphan. The Marquis de Marigny, Surintendant\r\ndes Batiments Royaux, obtained the authorization to chase out the\r\nparasites and clean up the Augean stable and put things in order as best\r\npleased his esthetic fancy, but only with the early years of the\r\nnineteenth century did the Louvre become a real palace again and worthy\r\nof its traditions.\r\n\r\nFrom 1803 to 1813 the architects Fontaine and Percier were constantly\r\nengaged in the work of repairs and additions, and built (for Napoleon I)\r\nthe gallery which extends from what is now the Place Jeanne d'Arc to the\r\nPavillon de Rohan, along the Rue de Rivoli. This detached portion (bound\r\nonly to the Tuileries) was finally joined to the seventeenth century\r\nwork of Lemercier under Louis Napoleon in 1852. This gallery, the work\r\nof \"moderns,\" is no mean example of palace-building, either. It was the\r\nwork of Visconti and Lefuel, and with the adoption of this plan was\r\nfinally accomplished the interpolation of that range of pavilions which\r\ngives the architecture of the Louvre one of its principal distinctions.\r\nNamed after the principal ministers of former administrations--Donon,\r\nMollien, Daru, Richelieu, Colbert, Turgot, etc., these pavilions break\r\nup what would otherwise be monotonous, elongated facades.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of this last built portion of the palace was held on\r\nAugust 14, 1857, the occasion being celebrated by a banquet given by\r\nNapoleon III to all the architects, artists and labourers who had been\r\nengaged upon the work. In the same Salle, two years later, which took\r\nthe name of Salle des Etats, the emperor gave a _diner de gala_ to the\r\ngenerals returning from the Italian campaign.\r\n\r\nStill further resume of fact with regard to the main body of the Louvre,\r\nas well as with respect to its individual components, will open\r\nnever-ending vistas and pageants. It is not possible in a chapter, a\r\nbook or a five-foot shelf to limn all that is even of cursory interest.\r\nThe well-known, the little-known and the comparatively unknown mingle in\r\nvarying proportions, according to the individual mood or attitude. To\r\nsome the appeal will lie in the vastness of the fabric, to others in the\r\nvaried casts of characters which have played upon its stage, still\r\nothers will be impressed with the dramatic incidents, and many more will\r\nretain only present-day memories of what they have themselves seen. The\r\nLouvre is a study of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nTo resume a none too complete chronology, it is easy to recall the\r\nfollowing important events which have taken place in the Louvre since\r\nthe days of Henri III, the period at which only the barest beginnings of\r\nthe present structure had been projected.\r\n\r\nIn 1591 a ghastly procedure took place when four members of the Conseil\r\ndes Seize were hung in the Salle des Caryatides by orders of the Duc de\r\nMayenne.\r\n\r\nLike the horoscope which foretold the death of Henri III, another royal\r\nprophecy was cast in 1610 that reminds one of that which perhaps had\r\nnot a little to do with the making away with the last of the Valois\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Vendome, the son of Henri IV by Gabrielle d'Estrees, handed\r\nthe king a documentary horoscope signed by an astrologer calling himself\r\nLa Brosse, which warned the king that he would run a great danger on May\r\n14 in case he went abroad.\r\n\r\n\"La Brosse is an ass,\" cried the king, and crumpled the paper beneath\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nOn the day in question the king started out to visit his minister,\r\nSully, at the Arsenal. It was then in turning from the Rue Saint Honore\r\ninto the Rue de la Ferroniere that the royal coach, frequently blocked\r\nby crowds, offered the opportunity to the assassin Ravaillac, who,\r\njumping upon the footboard, stabbed the king twice in the breast.\r\n\r\nAfter having been wounded the king was brought dying to the Louvre. His\r\nroyal coach drew up beneath the vault through which throngs all Paris\r\nto-day searching for a \"short cut\" from the river to Saint Honore. It\r\nwas but a short, brief journey to the royal apartments above in the\r\nPavilion de l'Horloge, but it must have been an interminable calvary to\r\nthe gallant Henri de Navarre. The body was received by Marie de Medici\r\nin tears, and the Ducs de Guise and d'Epernon clattered out the\r\ncourtyard on horseback to spread the false news that the king had\r\nsuffered no harm. Fearing the results of too precipitate publishing of\r\nthe disaster no other course was open.\r\n\r\nA gruesome memory is that the Swiss Guard at the Louvre surreptitiously\r\nacquired a \"_quartier_\" of the dismembered body of the regicide and\r\nroasted it in a fire set alight beneath the balcony of Marie de Medici\r\nas an indication of their faithfulness and loyalty.\r\n\r\nIt was Sully, the king's minister, who ran first up the stairs to\r\nacquaint the queen of the tragedy--faithful ever to the interests of his\r\nroyal master. In spite of this, one of the first acts of Marie de Medici\r\nas regent was to drive the Baron de Rosny and Duc de Sully away. Such is\r\nvirtue's reward--sometimes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Lying on his bed, his face uncovered, clad in white satin and a bonnet\r\nof red velvet embroidered with gold, was all that remained of Henri IV\r\nof France and Navarre. Around the bed were nuns and monks from all the\r\nmonasteries of Paris to keep vigil of his soul.\"\r\n\r\nSo ends the chronicle closing the chapter of the relations of Henri IV\r\nwith his Paris palace.\r\n\r\nNo particularly tragic event took place here for some years. Henriette\r\nde France, widow of Charles I of England, taking refuge in France from\r\nthe troublous revolt at home, lived in the Louvre in 1644. She had at\r\nfirst been graciously received by Mazarin, but was finally accorded only\r\nthe most strict necessities of life, a mere lodging in the Louvre, a\r\nmodest budget and a restricted entourage.\r\n\r\nIn 1662, under Louis XIV, Moliere and his troup, in a theatre installed\r\nin the Salle des Caryatides, gave the first \"command\" performance on\r\nrecord. The plays produced were, \"Nicodeme\" and \"Le Docteur Amoureux.\"\r\n\r\nAn \"art note\" of interest is that Sylvain Bailly, the first curator of\r\nthe Musee du Louvre, was born within its precincts in 1736.\r\n\r\nIn the dark days of July, 1830, the populace attempted to pillage and\r\nsack the palace, but after a bloody reprisal retired, leaving hundreds\r\nof dead on the field. The _parterre_ beneath the famous colonnade was\r\ntheir burial place, though a decade later the bodies were exhumed and\r\nagain interred under the Colonne de Juillet in the Place de la Bastille.\r\n\r\nLe Notre, the gardener of kings, laid out the first horticultural\r\nembellishments of the palace surroundings under Louis XIV, and with\r\nlittle change his scheme of decoration lasted until the time of Louis\r\nPhilippe, who made away with much that was distinctive and excellent.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III came to the front with an improved decorative scheme, but\r\nthe hard flags of to-day, the dusty gravel and the too sparse\r\narchitectural embellishments do not mark the gardens of the Louvre as\r\nbeing anything remarkable save as a desirable breathing spot for Paris\r\nnursemaids and their charges.\r\n\r\nThe iron gates of the north, south and east sides were put into place\r\nonly in 1855, and at the Commune served their purpose fairly well in\r\nholding the rabble at bay, a rabble to whose credit is the fact that it\r\nrespected the artistic inheritance enclosed by the Louvre's walls. No\r\nwork of art in the museums was stolen or destroyed, though the library\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE TUILERIES AND ITS GARDENS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORIGINAL PLAN of the TUILERIES]\r\n\r\nNo more sentimental interest ever attached itself to a royal French\r\npalace than that which surrounded the Tuileries from its inception by\r\nCharles IX in the mid-sixteenth century to its extinction by the Commune\r\nin 1871.\r\n\r\nThe Palace of the Tuileries is no more, the Commune did for it as it did\r\nfor the Hotel de Ville and many another noble monument of the capital,\r\nand all that remains are the gardens set about with a few marble\r\ncolumns and gilt balls--themselves fragments of former decorative\r\nelements of the palace--to suggest what once was the heritage bequeathed\r\nthe French by the Medici who was the queen of Saint Bartholomew's night.\r\n\r\nIt was a palace of giddy gayety that drew its devotees to it only to\r\ndestroy them. \"Crowned fools who wished to be called kings, and others.\"\r\nEven its stones were chiselled as if with a certain malignancy and\r\nfatalism, for they have all disappeared, and their history, even, has\r\nnot been written as large as that of those of many contemporary\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nOf the last five kings to which the Tuileries gave shelter--not counting\r\nthe Second Emperor--only one went straightway to the tomb; one went to\r\nthe scaffold and three others to exile. A sorry dowry, this, for an\r\ninheritor of a palace at once so noble and admirable in spite of its\r\nunluckiness.\r\n\r\nWith the court followers and the nobility of the last days of the\r\nmonarchy it was the same thing; the Tuileries was but a temporary\r\nshelter. The scaffold accounted for many and banishment engulfed others\r\nto forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nIt was a commonplace at the time to repeat the warning: \"O! Tuileries!\r\nO! Tuileries! Mad indeed are those who enter thy walls, for like Louis\r\nXVI, Napoleon, Charles X and Louis Philippe you shall make your exit by\r\nanother door.\"\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name Tuileries is somewhat ignominiously traced from\r\nthat of a tile factory which existed here in the heart of Paris, on the\r\nbanks of the Seine, in the sixteenth century. The property, which\r\ncomprised a manor-house as well as the tile fields, was known by the\r\nname of La Sablonniere, and came to the Marquis Neuville de Villeroy,\r\nSuperintendent of Finances, who built on the spot a sort of fortified\r\nchateau, which, if not of palatial dimensions, was of a palatial\r\nprodigality of luxury.\r\n\r\nLouise de Savoie, mother of Francis I, acquired the property in 1518 and\r\nnine years later gave it to Jean Tiercelin, the Maitre d'Hotel of the\r\ndauphin, who later was to become Henri II.\r\n\r\nThe lodge, or manor-house, had, by 1564, fallen into so ruinous a state\r\nthat Catherine de Medici, the widow of Henri II, set about to lay the\r\nfoundations of a new royal palace.\r\n\r\nCatherine never resided in her projected palace, and in 1566 Charles IX,\r\nher son, gave the commission to Philibert Delorme to build a palace,\r\n\"neighbouring upon the Louvre, but not to be connected therewith, on the\r\nsite of the Tuileries.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 11, work was begun, and the central pavilion and the two\r\nextremes were carried up two stories within a year. The central\r\nstructure was a great circular-domed edifice, enclosing a marvellous\r\nEscalier d'Honneur. The facade, preceded by two terraced porticos, was\r\non the courtyard, or garden, between the edifice and the Louvre. It sat\r\nback to the present Rue des Tuileries.\r\n\r\nThe Tuileries did not become a royal residence for some time after its\r\ncompletion, for Charles IX clung tenaciously to his well-guarded\r\napartments in the Louvre; for the central structure of the Tuileries,\r\nbecause of its lack of comparative height, was hardly as much of a\r\nstronghold as he would have liked.\r\n\r\nA contemporary note in connection with Charles IX and the Tuileries is\r\nfound in Ronsard's \"_Epitre a Charles IX_.\"\r\n\r\n   \"J'ay veu trop de macons\r\n   Bastir les Tuileries,\r\n   Et en trop de facons\r\n   Faire les momeries.\"\r\n\r\nWork on the edifice so auspiciously planned by Delorme was practically\r\ndiscontinued during the reign of Henri III, owing to lack of funds.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance of Delorme, Bullant, Lescot, each of whom had a hand in\r\nthe building of the Tuileries, expressed certain characteristic phases\r\nof architectural art in the reigns of Francis I and Henri II. The reign\r\nof Charles IX was only another phase of that long reign of Catherine de\r\nMedici, and architectural influences continued to follow along the same\r\nreminiscent Italian lines, particularly with reference to such edifices\r\nas the Medici herself caused to be built. In the dedication of Philibert\r\nDelorme's \"_Traite d'Architecture_\" he expressed himself thus with\r\nregard to the Tuileries:\r\n\r\n\"Madame, I see from day to day with an increasing pleasure the interest\r\nthat your Majesty takes in architecture. The palace which you have built\r\nat Paris near the Pont Neuf and the Louvre is, according to its\r\ndisposition, excellent and admirable to the extent that it pleases me\r\nbeyond measure.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Delorme considerable changes were made and successfully carried\r\nout under the architects Ducerceau, Duperac, Levau and Dorbay.\r\n\r\nA distinct feature of the work of Delorme was his use of the column\r\nornamented throughout its length, which, as he says in his written\r\nworks, he first employed in the \"_Palais de la Majeste de la Royne-Mere\r\na Paris_.\"\r\n\r\nOf the ability of Delorme there is no diversity of opinion to-day, nor\r\nwas there in his time. Besides the Tuileries he has to his credit the\r\nChateau d'Anet, the Chateau de Saint Maur, that of Meudon--built for the\r\nCardinal de Lorraine,--and his important additions to the Chateau de la\r\nMuette and the Chateaux of Saint Germain, Madrid and Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed Catherine de Medici professed a great admiration\r\nfor Delorme and recompensed his talents with a royal generosity, even\r\nnominating him as Abbe of the Convent of Saint Eloi de Noyon, a fact\r\nwhich caused the poet Ronsard to evolve a political satire: \"La Truelle\r\nCrossee.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time that she was building the Tuileries Catherine de Medici\r\ncaused additions to be made to the Louvre; at least she undertook the\r\ncompletion of the unfinished portion, which had been left for other\r\nhands to do.\r\n\r\nThe first historic souvenir which stands out prominently with regard to\r\nthe Palais des Tuileries is the fete given four days before the fateful\r\nSaint Bartholomew's night. It was the marriage fete of the gallant Henri\r\nde Bearn, King of Navarre, and the wise and witty Marguerite de Valois.\r\n\r\nHenri IV, coming to the throne a quarter of a century after the\r\nadmirable first year's work on the Tuileries had been completed, found\r\nthat little had been done towards making it a really habitable place. It\r\nhad been hurriedly finished off to the second story, and had served well\r\nenough for a temporary residence, or as an overflow establishment where\r\nballs and fetes might be given without crowding, but to the ambitious\r\nHenri IV nothing would do but that the pavilions should be bound\r\ntogether with a more imposing ligature, and that the Pavillon de Flore\r\nshould in turn be linked up with the Louvre by a gallery.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XIII this latter really came to a conclusion according to\r\nthe plans of the architect Ducerceau, but the inspiration of making the\r\nLouvre and the Tuileries one was due to Henri IV.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XIV and Louis XV the palace in its still attenuated form was\r\nscarcely more than a rambling lodging, utterly lacking any of the noble\r\napartments with which it was afterwards endowed. The court at this time\r\npractically made Versailles its headquarters. Neither of the\r\nabove-mentioned monarchs made aught but cursory visits to the Tuileries\r\nand left its occupancy to officers of the household and ministers of\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIt was in the reign of Louis XV that the Florentine artist, Servandoni,\r\nwho was at the same time an eminent architect, a remarkable painter and\r\na _maestro_ of a musician, organized in the Palais des Tuileries the\r\nTheatre des Machines, the first installed at Paris, and there came the\r\nComedie Francaise, the Opera and the Bouffes (the _Comedie Italienne_)\r\nand gave command performances before the court.\r\n\r\nWhen the French resolved that Louis XVI should live in Paris, the Palais\r\ndes Tuileries was actually offered him, but it was a rather shabby place\r\nof royal residence so far as its interior appointments were concerned,\r\nthough in all ways appealing when viewed from without. Considerable\r\nrepairs and embellishments were made, but warring factions did much to\r\nmake difficult any real artistic progress.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of Louis XVI there came a contrast to gayety and freedom\r\nfrom care in royal hearts and heads. On October 5 Louis XVI and the\r\nroyal family hid themselves behind barred doors, the convention taking\r\nup its sittings under the same roof and forthwith passing an act which\r\nallowed the completion of the palace according to the plans of Vignon at\r\nan expense of three hundred thousand _livres_. An almost entire\r\ntransformation took place, the money being seemingly well spent, and the\r\nstructure now first took its proper place among the monumental art\r\ntreasures of the capital.\r\n\r\nA dramatic incident took place at the great gate of the Tuileries, which\r\nfaced the courtyard, when, on May 28, 1795, the populace surged in waves\r\nagainst its sturdy barrier. The Deputy Feraud met them at the steps.\r\n\"You may enter only over my dead body,\" he said. No reply was made but\r\nto crack his skull, behead the trunk and carry the head aloft on a pike\r\nto the very Tribune where Boissy d'Anglas was presiding.\r\n\r\nThe Salle de Spectacle of the Tuileries was, even at this period, the\r\nlargest auditorium of its kind in Europe, having eight thousand stalls\r\nand boxes, which gave a seating capacity of considerably more than that\r\nnumber of persons.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 this playhouse, of which the parquet occupied the ground floor\r\nof the Pavillon de Marsan, underwent a strange metamorphosis when it\r\nbecame the legislative hall for the National Convention. All the names\r\nand emblems showing forth in its decorations and indicative of its\r\nancient rule were changed into Republican devices and symbols. The\r\nPavillon de Marsan was called the Pavillon de l'Egalite, the Pavillon du\r\nCentre became the Pavillon de l'Unite and the Pavillon de Flore the\r\nPavillon de la Liberte, where was lodged the Committee of Public\r\nSafety.\r\n\r\nThe Hall of the Convention, according to reports of the time, was an\r\nappalling mixture of grandeur and effeminacy with respect to its\r\narchitectural lines. Surrounding that portion where the legislators\r\nactually sat was the great amphitheatre which for three years was\r\noccupied by a curious, vociferous public, more demonstrative, even, than\r\nthose that had attended the former theatrical representations in the\r\nsame apartment.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening of the National Convention to the reaction of\r\n\"Thermidor\" it is estimated that more than three million people assisted\r\nat what they rightly, or wrongly, considered as a \"spectacle\" staged\r\nonly for their amusement.\r\n\r\nBy the time Napoleon had come into power the Tuileries was hardly\r\nhabitable, and before taking up his residence he was obliged to make\r\nimmediate and extensive transformations.\r\n\r\nOn February 19, 1800, Napoleon, still First Consul, left the Palais de\r\nLuxembourg and took up his residence in the Tuileries, the Third Consul,\r\nLebrun, being lodged in the Pavillon de Flore, in the \"Petite\r\nAppartement,\" which Marie Antoinette had fitted up for her temporary\r\naccommodation when in town. Lebrun, however, gave up his lodging to the\r\nPope when the Pontiff came to Paris at Napoleon's orders. Consul\r\nCambaceres, however, refused to shelter himself beneath the roof of the\r\nTuileries, and indicated a preference for the magnificent Hotel\r\nd'Elboeuf, which was accommodatingly put at his disposition.\r\n\r\nNapoleon entered the Tuileries in state, preceded and followed by an\r\nimposing cortege. At the gate of the Carrousel the consuls alighted from\r\ntheir carriages, and were received by the Consular Guard. On their\r\narrival the consuls read the following inscription posted at the\r\nentrance: \"On August 10th monarchy in France was forever abolished; it\r\nwill never be restored.\" By the 20th of February the inscription had\r\ndisappeared. Besides, orders were given to cut down the two liberty\r\ntrees which had been planted in the courtyard. On August 10 a large\r\nquantity of cannon shot had been lodged in the facade of the Tuileries,\r\nand around the shot were written these words: \"Tenth of August.\" The\r\ncannon balls disappeared, as well as the inscriptions, when the Arc de\r\nTriomphe was erected on the Place du Carrousel.\r\n\r\nThis alteration gave great satisfaction. It was important for the\r\ntranquillity of France that the new government should inherit rather the\r\nsword of Charlemagne than the guillotine of Marat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Salle des Marechaux, Tuileries_]\r\n\r\nThe imperial court soon displayed its splendour and magnificence in\r\nthe Palais des Tuileries, as a foregone conclusion anticipated.\r\n\r\nIn a gorgeous and imposing Salle du Trone one might have seen in the\r\ndeep casement of the central window, standing up, their hats off, the\r\ngroup of the Corps Diplomatique, the members of which, loaded with\r\ndecorations, ensigns, and diamonds, trembled in the presence of the\r\nLittle Corporal of other days; on the other side, the host of the\r\nPrinces of the Rhine Confederation--all the personages that Germany,\r\nRussia, Poland, Italy, Denmark, Spain, all Europe, in one word, England\r\nexcepted, had sent to Paris.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the wedding reception of Napoleon and Marie\r\nLouise at the Tuileries was celebrated with unusual magnificence.\r\nAnother event, on account of its peculiar moment, strongly excited the\r\nenthusiasm of the French. On March 20, 1811, at seven o'clock in the\r\nmorning, the first salute of cannon announced that the empress had given\r\nbirth to a child, the future Aiglon, the King of Rome.\r\n\r\nAfter Napoleon's occupancy of the Tuileries it again served the monarch\r\nunder the Empire, the Restoration, under Louis Philippe and under the\r\nSecond Empire. The palace of unhappy memory saw successively the fall of\r\nNapoleon, the entry of Louis XVIII, the file-by of the Allies, the\r\nflight of Louis XVIII, of Charles X, Louis Philippe and Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the Second Empire the Tuileries preserved, more or\r\nless, its original interior arrangement, and, to a great extent, the\r\ndecorations with which it had been embellished under Louis XIV, Louis\r\nXVI, and Napoleon I.\r\n\r\nThe Pavilion de Flore, at the juncture of the Tuileries and the Louvre\r\nof Henri IV, was practically rebuilt during the Second Empire, but it\r\nfollowed closely the contemporary designs of the adjoining building.\r\nHere are quartered executive offices of the Prefecture de la Seine. That\r\nportion facing the Pont Royal contains a series of fine sculptures by\r\nCarpeaux, the sole modern embellishments of this nature to be seen in or\r\non a Paris palace.\r\n\r\nAs the Commune mob was fleeing before the army of Versailles a\r\nconflagration broke out in the Tuileries and soon the whole edifice was\r\nin flames. Within what may have been the briefest interval on record for\r\na conflagration of its size the Tuileries was but a smoking pile of\r\nhalf-calcined stones.\r\n\r\nThe Tuileries had another brief day of glory when the Prince President,\r\nLouis Napoleon, entered its gates, coming straight from his inauguration\r\nat Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nThe cannon at the Hotel des Invalides blazed out a welcome and every\r\npatriot Republican shouted: \"Vive Napoleon!\" They little knew, little\r\ncared perhaps, that he would some day become the Second Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe throng poured forth from the cathedral after the _Domine Salvum_ and\r\nthe benediction, the clergy leading the way, followed by the president\r\nand his attendants. The orchestra played a lively march, and the great\r\nbell in the tower boomed forth a glorious peal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe president's carriage drew up before the gates of the Tuileries and\r\nhe entered the great apartment where a reception was given to various\r\npublic and military bodies. Between seven and eight thousand naval and\r\nmilitary officers paid their respects, and about half a battalion of the\r\narmy saluted, among them two Mamelukes. While this ceremony was going\r\non, the Place du Carrousel was occupied by several squadrons of cavalry\r\nand the inner courtyards were practically infantry camps. The government\r\nwas taking no chances at the beginning of its career. The reception\r\nlasted until well on towards evening, when a banquet of four hundred\r\ncovers was laid and partaken of by the invited guests.\r\n\r\nThe last days of the Tuileries may be said to have commenced with that\r\neventful September 3, 1870, at five o'clock in the afternoon, when the\r\nEmpress Eugenie received a telegraphic despatch from Napoleon III\r\nannouncing his captivity and the defeat of Sedan. It was the overthrow.\r\n\r\nThe evening and the night were calm; the masses, as yet, were unaware of\r\nthe fatal news the journals would publish on the morrow. The following\r\nday was Sunday; the weather superb; the disaster was finally announced\r\nand the masses thronged from all parts to the Place de la Concorde,\r\nwhere a squadron of Cuirassiers barred the bridge leading to the Palais\r\nBourbon where the deputies were in session.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the news the empress had called in General Trochu, the\r\nMilitary Governor of Paris, and asked him if he could guarantee order.\r\nHe replied in the affirmative. Some hours later a group of deputies came\r\nto the empress and counselled her to sign, not an abdication, but a\r\nmomentary renunciation of her powers as regent. Eugenie refused\r\npoint-blank.\r\n\r\nThe throng, passing by the left bank, had arrived at the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, and the formal sitting became a revolutionary one. At three\r\no'clock the imperial dynasty was proclaimed as at an end, and a\r\nprovisionary government installed. Henri Rochefort, the present editor\r\nof the \"_Intransingeant_,\" was delivered from the prison of Sainte\r\nPelagie and made a member of the government.\r\n\r\nBy this time the mob which had invaded the Place de la Concorde became\r\nmenacing. The cry, \"Aux Tuileries,\" first launched by the street gamins,\r\nsoon became the slogan of the crowd. To say it was to do it; the great\r\niron gates were closed, but in default of a protecting force of arms it\r\nwas an easy matter to scale them.\r\n\r\nBehind the curtained windows of the palace the empress witnessed the\r\nassault and murmured to her ladies-in-waiting: \"It is then finished.\"\r\nShe turned towards the Prince de Metternich and the Chevalier Nigra,\r\nand, in the voice of a suppliant, demanded: \"_Que me consillez vous?_\"\r\n\r\n\"You must leave at once, Madame; in a moment the palace will be\r\ninvaded.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress became resigned and accompanied by Madame Le Breton,\r\nMetternich and Nigra started for the Pavilion de Flore, passing through\r\nthe Galerie de Musee and the Galerie d'Apollon, finally leaving by the\r\ngate of the Louvre, which is opposite Saint Germain l'Auxerrois.\r\n\r\nThe empress was at last out of the palace, but not yet out of danger. A\r\nband of manifestants, making for the Hotel de Ville and shouting; \"Vive\r\nla Republique,\" recognized the empress, but she mounted an empty fiacre\r\nwith Madame Le Breton, and giving the driver the first address that\r\nentered her mind thus escaped further indignities, and perhaps danger.\r\nFinally she found a refuge with Doctor Evans, the American dentist\r\nliving in the Avenue Malakoff, from whose house she left for England on\r\nthe following day.\r\n\r\nThis is the Frenchman's point of view of one of the picturesque\r\nincidents of history. It disposes of the legend that the empress left\r\nthe Tuileries in the carriage of Doctor Evans, but this cannot be\r\nhelped, with due regard for the consensus of French opinion. Doctor\r\nEvans was a family friend, besides being the dentist who cared for the\r\nimperial teeth, and it is not going beyond the truth to state that the\r\nfortunate American acquired not a little of his vogue and wealth by his\r\nassociation with Napoleon III and his family.\r\n\r\nBy this time the populace had invaded the palace and cursed with\r\nindignities unmentionable the marble halls, and the furnishings in\r\ngeneral, and pillaged such portable property as pleased the individual\r\nfancies of the spoilsmen.\r\n\r\nAfter the signing of the Peace Treaty by the Bordeaux Assembly, which\r\nnow represented the governmental head, and Thiers had become president,\r\nthat worthy would do away with the cannon of which the National Guard\r\nstill held possession in their garrison on the Butte of Montmartre. The\r\norders which he sent forth came to be the signal for another outbreak on\r\nthe part of the populace. On March 18 the Commune was proclaimed and\r\nCitoyen Dardelle, an old African hunter, was appointed military governor\r\nof the Tuileries. Whatever this individual's military qualifications may\r\nhave been, he delivered himself to the enjoyment of a high and dissolute\r\nlife in his luxurious apartments in the palace; a fact which was\r\nspeedily made note of by the still restless populace.\r\n\r\nThe Citoyen Rousselle, a member of the Communal Government, had the idea\r\nof organizing a series of popular concerts in the gardens of the\r\nTuileries for the profit of the wounded in the late friction.\r\n\r\nHung on the walls, at the entrance of each apartment was a placard which\r\nread: \"Fellow men, the gold with which these walls were built was earned\r\nby your sweat.\" \"To-day you are coming to your own.\" \"Remain faithful to\r\nyour trust and see to it that the tyrants enter never more.\"\r\n\r\nDuring one of these public concerts a poem of Hegesippe Moreau was read\r\nwhich terminated as follows, and set the populace aflame.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *\r\n   \"Et moi j'applaudirai; ma jeuneusse engourdie\r\n   Se rechauffera a ce grand incendie.\"\r\n\r\nHe referred to the burning of the former abode of emperors and kings as\r\na sort of sacrifice to the common good. The public had held itself in\r\nhand very well up to this moment, but applauded the verses vociferously.\r\nThe last of the concerts was held on May 21, the same day as the Army of\r\nVersailles entered Paris. Night came, and with it the raging, red flames\r\nspringing skywards from the roof of the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the flames had enveloped the entire building. All the\r\nforces that it was possible to gather had been ordered upon the scene,\r\nbut they were unable to save the old palace, and by one o'clock in the\r\nmorning it was but a mass of smoking ruins. The Communards had done\r\ntheir work well. Before leaving its precincts they had sprinkled coal\r\noil over every square metre of carpet, window-hangings and tapestries,\r\nand the slow-match was not long in passing the fire to its inflammable\r\ntimber. The library of the Louvre was destroyed, but the museums,\r\ngalleries and their famous collections fortunately escaped.\r\n\r\nFor a dozen years the lamentable ruins of the old palace of the\r\nTuileries reared their singed walls, a witness and a reproach to the\r\ntempestuosity of a people. Finally, in 1882, Monsieur Achille Picard\r\nundertook their removal for thirty-three thousand francs, and within a\r\nyear not a vestige, not an unturned stone remained in its original place\r\nas a witness to this chapter of Paris history.\r\n\r\nTwo porticos of the Pavillon de l'Horloge, originally forming a part of\r\nthe Tuileries, have been re-erected on the terrace of the Orangerie,\r\nfacing the Place de la Concorde.\r\n\r\nThere remain but two survivors of the late imperial sway in France, the\r\nEmpress Eugenie who lives in England, and Emile Olivier, \"_l'homme au\r\ncoeur leger_,\" who lives at Saint Tropez in the Midi.\r\n\r\nA Paris journalist a year or more ago, while sitting among a little\r\ncoterie of literary and artistic folk at Lavenue's famous terrace-cafe,\r\nrecounted the following incident clothed in most discreet language, and\r\nsince it bears upon the Tuileries and its last occupants it is repeated\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\"Last night beneath the glamour of a September moon I saw a black shadow\r\nsilently creep out from beneath the gloom of the arcades of the Rue de\r\nRivoli just below the Hotel Continental. It crossed the pavement and\r\npassed within the railings of the gardens opposite, one of the gates to\r\nwhich, by chance or prearranged design, was still open. It moved slowly\r\nhere and there upon the gravelled walks and seated itself upon a\r\nsolitary bench as if it were meditating upon the splendid though sad\r\nhours that had passed. Was it a wraith; was it Eugenie, late empress of\r\nthe French?\"\r\n\r\nTo have remembered such a dream of fancy for forty long years one must\r\nhave been endowed with superhuman courage, or an inexplicable\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nThe Rue des Pyramides, which has been prolonged to the banks of the\r\nSeine, will give those of the present generation who have never seen the\r\nTuileries an exact idea of its location. If it still existed the facade\r\nof the palace would front upon this street.\r\n\r\nThe most moving history of the detailed horrors of the Commune,\r\nparticularly with reference to the part played by the Tuileries therein,\r\nis to be found in Maxime Ducamp's \"_Les Derniers Convulsions de Paris_.\"\r\n\r\nOne relic of the Tuileries left unharmed found a purchaser in a\r\nRoumanian prince, at a public sale held as late as 1889. This was the\r\nornately beautiful iron gate which separated the Cour du Carrousel from\r\nthe Cour des Tuileries. Roumanian by birth, French at heart and Parisian\r\nby adoption, this wealthy amateur, for a trifle over eight thousand\r\nfrancs, became the owner of a royal souvenir which must have cost five\r\nhundred times that sum.\r\n\r\nThe eastern front of the Tuileries opened into a courtyard formed under\r\nthe direction of the first Napoleon. It was separated from the Place du\r\nCarrousel by a handsome iron railing with gilt spear-heads extending the\r\nwhole range of the palace. From this court there were three entrances\r\ninto the Place du Carrousel, the central gate corresponding with the\r\ncentral pavilion of the palace, the other two having their piers\r\nsurmounted by colossal figures of victory, peace, history and France. A\r\ngateway under each of the lateral galleries also communicated on the\r\nnorth with the Rue de Rivoli, and on the south with the Quai du Louvre.\r\nThe Place du Carrousel was named in honour of a tournament held upon the\r\nspot by Louis XIV in 1662. It communicated on the north with the Rue\r\nRichelieu and the Rue de l'Echelle, and on the south with the Pont Royal\r\nand the Pont du Carrousel. To-day in the square stands the triumphal\r\narch erected by Napoleon in 1806, after the designs of Percier and\r\nFontaine.\r\n\r\nThe newly laid-out and furbished-up gardens make the Place du Carrousel\r\neven more attractive than it was when set about with flagged areas,\r\ngravelled walks and paved road ways, and, while the monumental and\r\narchitectural accessories excel the horticultural embellishments in\r\nquantity, the general effect is incomparably finer at present than\r\nanything known before.\r\n\r\nPlans for rebuilding the Place du Carrousel provide for a division into\r\nthree distinct parts, three grand _pelouses_, _a boulingrins a la\r\nFrancais_, or lawns of a circumscribed area, according to the best\r\ntraditions of Le Notre, a border of flowers and a few decoratively\r\ndisposed clumps of flowering shrubs, the whole combined in such a way\r\nthat the perspective and vista down the Champs Elysees will in no manner\r\nsuffer. The architect-landscapist, M. Redon, who has been charged with\r\nthe work, has drawn his inspiration from a series of unexecuted designs\r\nof Le Notre which have recently been brought to light from the innermost\r\ndepths of the national archives. It was a safe way of avoiding an\r\nanachronism, and this time a government architect has chosen well his\r\nplan of execution.\r\n\r\nIn later years the question of the reembellishment of the Garden of the\r\nTuileries has ever been before the public, but little has actually been\r\nchanged save the remaking of certain garden plots, the planting of a few\r\nshrubs or the placing of a few statues.\r\n\r\nThe Garden of the Tuileries has a superficial area of 232,632 square\r\nmetres. It is the most popular of all open spaces in the capital to the\r\nParisian who would take his walks abroad not too far from the centre of\r\nthings. The chief curiosity of the garden is the celebrated chestnut\r\ntree which burst into flower on the day of Napoleon's arrival from\r\nElba--March 20. The precocious tree has ever been revered by the\r\nBonapartists since, though the tree has never performed the trick the\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nStatues innumerable are scattered here and there through the garden and\r\ngive a certain sense of liveliness to the area. Some are by famous\r\nnames, others by those less renowned, but as a whole they make little\r\nimpression on one, chiefly, perhaps, because one does not come to the\r\nGarden of the Tuileries to see statues.\r\n\r\nTo the left and right are the terraces, first laid out by the celebrated\r\nLe Notre. Like the hanging gardens of Babylon, they overlook a lower\r\nlevel of _parterres_, gravelled walks and ornamental waters. Along the\r\nRue de Rivoli is the Terrasse de l'Orangerie, and on the side of the\r\nriver is the Terrasse de la Marine.\r\n\r\nAccording to the original plans of Le Notre the garden was set down as\r\nfive hundred _toises_ in length, and one hundred and sixty-eight\r\n_toises_ in width, the latter dimension corresponding to that of the\r\nfacade of the palace.\r\n\r\nAlong the shady avenues of this admirable city garden of to-day an\r\nenterprising _concessionaire_ has won a fortune by renting out\r\nrush-bottomed chairs to nursemaids, retired old gentlemen with red\r\nribbons in their buttonholes, and trippers from across the channel. It\r\nis a perfectly legitimate enterprise and a profitable one it would seem,\r\nand has been in operation considerably more than half a century.\r\n\r\nIt was from the Gardens of the Tuileries in 1784 that took place\r\nBlanchard's celebrated ascension in Montgolfier's balloon and brought\r\nforth the encomium from the British Royal Society that the body was not\r\nin the least surprised that a Frenchman should have solved the problem\r\nof \"volatability.\" The French monarch, more practical, was so mightily\r\npleased with the success of the experiment that he bestowed upon the\r\nauthor the sum of four hundred thousand francs from his treasury to be\r\nused for the perfection of the art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE PALAIS CARDINAL AND THE PALAIS ROYAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Louvre and the Tuileries the Palais Royal shares the popular\r\ninterest of the traveller among all the monuments of Paris. No other\r\nedifice evokes more vivid souvenirs of its historic past than this\r\nhybrid palace of Richelieu. One dreams even to-day, of its\r\nsumptuousness, its legends, its amusing and extravagant incidents which\r\ncast a halo of romantic interest over so many illustrious personages. So\r\nthoroughly Parisian is the Palais Royal in all things that it has been\r\ncalled \"the Capital of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nNot far from the walled and turreted stronghold of the old Louvre rose\r\nthe private palaces, only a little less royal, of the Rambouillets, the\r\nMercoeurs and other nobles of the courtly train. They lived, too, in\r\nalmost regal state until Armand du Plessis de Richelieu came to humble\r\ntheir pride, by fair means or foul, by buying up or destroying their\r\nsumptuous dwellings, levelling off a vast area of land, and, in 1629,\r\ncommencing work on that imposing pile which was first known as the\r\nPalais Cardinal, later the Palais d'Orleans, then as the Palais de la\r\nRevolution and finally as the Palais Royal.\r\n\r\nIt was near, yet far enough away from the royal residence of the Louvre\r\nnot to be overshadowed by it. The edifice enclosed a great square of\r\nground laid out with symmetrically planted trees and adorned with\r\nfountains and statues.\r\n\r\nFrom the great central square four smaller courts opened out to each of\r\nthe principal points of the compass; there were also, besides the living\r\nrooms, a chapel, two theatres, ballrooms, boudoirs and picture\r\ngalleries, all of a luxury never before dreamed of but by kings.\r\n\r\nThe main entrance was in the Rue Saint Honore, and over its portal were\r\nthe graven arms of Richelieu, surmounted by the cardinal's hat and the\r\ninscription: \"Palais Cardinal.\" Like his English compeer, Wolsey,\r\nRichelieu's ardour for building knew no restraint. He added block upon\r\nblock of buildings and yard upon yard to garden walls until all was a\r\nveritable labyrinth. Finally the usually subservient Louis saw the\r\ncondition of things; he liked it not that his minister should dwell in\r\nmarble halls more gorgeous than his own. As a matter of policy the\r\nCardinal ceased to build more and at his death, as if to atone, willed\r\nthe entire property to his king.\r\n\r\nAs the Palais Cardinal, the edifice was subjected to many impertinent\r\nrailleries from the public which, as a whole, was ever antagonistic to\r\nthe \"_Homme Rouge_.\" They did not admit the right of an apostolic\r\nprelate of the church to lodge himself so luxuriously when the very\r\nprecepts of his religion recommended modesty and humility. Richelieu's\r\ncontemporaries did not hesitate to admire wonderingly all this luxury of\r\nlife and its accessories, and Corneille, in the \"_Menteur_\" (1642),\r\nmakes one of the principal characters say:\r\n\r\n   \"Non, l'univers ne peut rien voir d'egal\r\n   Aux superbes dehors du Palais Cardinal;\r\n   Toute une ville entiere avec pompe batie,\r\n   Semble d'un vieux fosse par miracle sortie,\r\n   Et nous fais presumer a ses superbes toits\r\n   Que tous ses habitants sont des dieux ou des rois.\"\r\n\r\nThe ground plan of the Palais Cardinal was something unique among city\r\npalaces. In the beginning ground values were not what they are to-day in\r\nParis. There were acres upon acres of greensward set about and cut up\r\nwith gravelled walks, great alleyed rows of trees, groves without number\r\nand galleries and colonnades innumerable. Without roared the traffic of\r\na great city, a less noisy traffic than that of to-day, perhaps, but\r\nstill a contrasting maelstrom of bustle and furor as compared with the\r\ntranquillity within.\r\n\r\nAfter the edifice was finished it actually fell into disuse, except for\r\nthe periodical intervals when the Cardinal visited the capital. At other\r\ntimes it was as quiet as a cemetery. Moss grew on the flags, grass on\r\nthe gravelled walks and tangled shrubbery killed off the budding flowers\r\nof the gardens.\r\n\r\nRichelieu's last home-coming, after the execution of Cinq-Mars at Lyons,\r\nwas a tragic one. The despot of France, once again under his own\r\nrooftree, threw himself upon his bed surrounded by his choicest pictures\r\nand tapestries, and paid the price of his merciless arrogance towards\r\nall men--and women--by folding his wan hands upon his breast and\r\nexclaiming, somewhat unconvincingly: \"Thus do I give myself to God.\" As\r\nif recalling himself to the stern reality of things he added: \"I have no\r\nenemies but those of State.\"\r\n\r\nIn a robe of purple silk, supported by pillows of the finest down and\r\ncovered with the rarest of laces, he rigidly straightened himself out\r\nand expired without a shudder, with the feeling that he was well beyond\r\nthe reach of invisible foes. But before he died Richelieu received a\r\nvisit from his king in person. This was another token of his invincible\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThus the Palais Royal was evolved from the Palais Cardinal of Richelieu.\r\nRichelieu gave the orders for its construction to Jacques Lemercier\r\nimmediately after he had dispossessed the Rambouillets and the\r\nMercoeurs, intending at first to erect only a comparatively modest\r\ntown dwelling with an ample garden. Vanity, or some other passion,\r\nfinally caused to grow up the magnificently proportioned edifice which\r\nwas called the Palais Cardinal instead of that which was to be known\r\nmore modestly as the Hotel de Richelieu.\r\n\r\nVast and imposing, but not without a certain graceful symmetry, the\r\nPalais Royal of to-day is a composition of many separate edifices\r\ndivided by a series of courts and gardens and connected by arcaded\r\ngalleries. The right wing enclosed an elaborate Salle de Spectacle while\r\nthat to the left enclosed an equally imposing chamber with a ceiling by\r\nPhilippe de Champaigne, known as the Galerie des Hommes Illustres, and\r\nfurther ornamented with portraits of most of the court favourites of\r\nboth sexes of the time. The architectural ornamentation of this gallery\r\nwas of the Doric order, most daringly interspersed with moulded ships'\r\nprows, anchors, cables and what not of a marine significance.\r\n\r\nIn 1636, divining the attitude of envy of many of the nobility who\r\nfrequented his palace, Richelieu--great man of politics that he\r\nwas--made a present of the entire lot of curios to Louis XIII, but\r\nundertaking to house them for him, which he did until his death in 1642.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Louis XIII the Palais Cardinal, which had been left to\r\nhim in its entirety by the will of Richelieu, came to Anne d'Autriche,\r\nthe regent, who, with the infant Louis XIV and the royal family,\r\ninstalled herself therein, and from now on (October 7, 1642), the\r\nedifice became known as the Palais Royal.\r\n\r\nNow commenced the political role of this sumptuous palace which hitherto\r\nhad been but the Cardinal's caprice. Mazarin had succeeded Richelieu,\r\nand to escape the anger of the Frondeurs, he, with the regent and the\r\ntwo princes, Louis XIV and the Duc d'Anjou, fled to the refuge of Saint\r\nGermain-en-Laye.\r\n\r\nIn company with Mademoiselle de Montpensier, who had been rudely\r\nawakened from her slumbers in the Luxembourg, they took a coach in the\r\ndead of night for Saint Germain. It was a long and weary ride; the _Pavi\r\ndu Roi_ was then, as now, the most execrable suburban highroad in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWhen calm was reestablished Mazarin refused to allow the regent to take\r\nup her residence again in the old abode of Richelieu and turned it over\r\nto Henriette de France, the widow of Charles I, who had been banished\r\nfrom England by Cromwell.\r\n\r\nThirty odd years later Louis XIV, when he was dreaming of his Versailles\r\nproject, made a gift of the property to his nephew, Philippe d'Orleans,\r\nDuc de Chartres. Important reconstructions and rearrangements had been\r\ncarried on from time to time, but nothing so radical as to change the\r\nspecious aspect of the palace of the Cardinal's time, though it had been\r\nconsiderably enlarged by extending it rearward and annexing the Hotel\r\nDanville in the present Rue Richelieu. Mansart on one occasion was\r\ncalled in and built a new gallery that Coypel decorated with fourteen\r\ncompositions after the AEnid of Virgil.\r\n\r\nUnder the regency the Salon d'Entree was redecorated by Oppenard, and a\r\nseries of magnificent fetes was organized by the pleasure-loving queen\r\nfrom the Austrian court. Richelieu's theatre was made into an\r\nopera-house, and masked balls of an unparalleled magnificence were\r\nfrequently given, not forgetting to mention--without emphasis\r\nhowever--suppers of a Pantagruelian opulence and lavish orgies at which\r\nthe chronicles only hint.\r\n\r\nIn 1661, Monsieur, brother of the king, took up his official residence\r\nin the palace, enlarged it in various directions and in many ways\r\ntransformed and improved it. Having become the sole proprietor of the\r\nedifice and its gardens, by Letters Patent of February, 1692, the Duc\r\nd'Orleans left this superb property, in 1701, to his son the too famous\r\nregent, Philippe d'Orleans, whose orgies and extravagances rendered the\r\nPalais Royal notorious to the utmost corners of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe first years of the eighteenth century were indeed notorious. It was\r\nthen that Palais Royal became the head-centre for debauch and abandon.\r\nIt is from this epoch, too, that date the actual structures which to-day\r\nform this vast square of buildings, at all events their general outline\r\nis little changed to-day from what it was at that time.\r\n\r\nIf the regent's policy was to carry the freedom and luxury of\r\nRichelieu's time to excess, replacing even the edifices of the Cardinal\r\nwith more elaborate structures, his son Louis (1723-1752) sought in his\r\nturn to surround them with an atmosphere more austere.\r\n\r\nA disastrous fire in 1763 caused the Palais Royal to be rebuilt by order\r\nof Louis Philippe d'Orleans, the future Philippe-Egalite, by the\r\narchitect Moreau, who carried out the old traditions as to form and\r\noutline, and considerably increased the extent and number of the arcades\r\nfrom one hundred and eighty to two hundred and seven. These the astute\r\nduke immediately rented out to shopkeepers at an annual rental of more\r\nthan ten millions. This section was known characteristically enough as\r\nthe Palais Marchand, and thus the garden came to be surrounded by a\r\nmonumental and classic arcade of shops which has ever remained a\r\ndistinct feature of the palace.\r\n\r\nA second fire burned out the National Opera, which now sought shelter in\r\nthe Palais Royal, and in 1781 the Theatre des Varietes Amusantes was\r\nconstructed, and which has since been made over into the home of the\r\nComedie Francaise.\r\n\r\nThe transformations imposed by Philippe-Egalite were considerable, and\r\nthe famous chestnut trees, which had been planted within the courtyard\r\nin the seventeenth century by Richelieu, were cut down. He built also\r\nthe three transverse galleries which have cut the gardens of to-day into\r\nmuch smaller plots than they were in Richelieu's time. In spite of this\r\nthere is still that pleasurable tranquillity to be had therein to-day,\r\nscarcely a stone's throw from the rush and turmoil of the whirlpool of\r\nwheeled traffic which centres around the junction of the Rue Richelieu\r\nwith the Avenue de l'Opera. It is as an oasis in a turbulent sandstorm,\r\na beneficent shelf of rock in a whirlpool of rapids. The only thing to\r\nbe feared therein is that a toy aeroplane of some child will put an eye\r\nout, or that the more devilish _diabolo_ will crack one's skull.\r\n\r\nUnder the regency of the Duc Philippe d'Orleans the various apartments\r\nof the palace were the scenes of scandalous goings-on, which were\r\nrelated at great length in the chronicles of the time. It was a very\r\nmixed world which now frequented the _purlieus_ of the Palais Royal. Men\r\nand women about town jostled with men of affairs, financiers,\r\nspeculators and agitators of all ranks and of questionable\r\nrespectability. Milords, as strangers from across the Manche came first\r\nto be known here, delivered themselves to questionable society and still\r\nmore questionable pleasures. It was at a little later period that the\r\nDuc de Chartres authorized the establishment of the cafes and\r\nrestaurants which for a couple of generations became the most celebrated\r\nrendezvous in Paris--the Cafe de Foy, the Cafe de la Paix, the Cafe\r\nCarrazzo and various other places of reunion whose very names, to say\r\nnothing of the incidents connected therewith, have come down to history.\r\n\r\nIt was the establishment of these public rendezvous which contributed\r\nso largely to the events which unrolled themselves in the Palais Royal\r\nin 1789. This \"Eden de l'Enfer,\" as it was known, has in late years been\r\nentirely reconstructed; the old haunts of the Empire have gone and\r\nnothing has come to take their place.\r\n\r\nThen came another class of establishments which burned brilliantly in\r\nthe second rank and were, in a way, political rendezvous also--the Cafe\r\nde Chartres and the Cafe de Valois. Of all these Palais Royal cafes of\r\nthe early nineteenth century the most gorgeous and brilliant was the\r\nCafe des Mille Colonnes, though its popularity was seemingly due to the\r\ncharms of the _maitresse de la maison_, a Madame Romain, whose husband\r\nwas a dried-up, dwarfed little man of no account whatever. Madame\r\nRomain, however, lived well up to her reputation as being\r\n\"_incontestablement la plus jolie femme de Paris_.\" By 1824 the fame of\r\nthe establishment had begun to wane and in 1826 it expired, though the\r\n\"_Almanach des Gourmands_\" of the latter year said that the proprietor\r\nwas the Very of _limonadiers_, that his ices were superb, his salons\r\nmagnificent--and his prices exorbitant. Perhaps it was the latter that\r\ndid it!\r\n\r\nAnother establishment, founded in 1817, was domiciled here, the clients\r\nbeing served by \"_odalisques en costume oriental, tres seduisantes_.\"\r\nThis is quoted from the advertisements of the day. The cafe was called\r\nthe Cafe des Circassiennes, and there was a _sultane_, who was the\r\npresiding genius of the place. It met with but an indifferent success\r\nand soon closed its doors despite its supposedly all-compelling\r\nattractions.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-nineteenth century a revolution came over the cafes of Paris.\r\nTobacco had invaded their precincts; previously one smoked only in the\r\n_estaminets_. Three cafes of the Palais Royal resisted the innovation,\r\nthe Cafe de la Galerie d'Orleans, the Cafe de Foy and the Cafe de la\r\nRotonde. To-day, well, to-day things are different.\r\n\r\nThe Theatre du Palais Royal of to-day was the Theatre des Marionettes of\r\nthe Comte de Beaujolais, which had for contemporaries the Fantoches\r\nItaliens, the Ombres Chinoises and the Musee Curtius, perhaps the first\r\nof the wax-works shows that in later generations became so popular. The\r\nPalais Royal had now become a vast amusement enterprise, with side-shows\r\nof all sorts, theatres, concerts, cafes, restaurants, clubs,\r\ngambling-houses and what not--all paying rents, and high ones, to the\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the garden, where is now the fountain and its basin,\r\nwas a circus, half underground and half above, and there were\r\ninnumerable booths and kiosks for the sale of foolish trifles, all\r\npaying tribute to the ground landlord.\r\n\r\nGaming at the Palais Royal was not wholly confined to the public\r\ngambling houses. During the carnival season of 1777 the gambling which\r\nwent on in the royal apartments became notorious for even that\r\nprofligate time: in one night the Duc de Chartres lost eight thousand\r\n_livres_. Louis XVI, honest man, took all due precautions to reduce this\r\nextravagance, but was impotent.\r\n\r\nBetween the courtyard fountain and the northern arcade of the inner\r\npalace was placed the famous Cannon du Palais Royal, which, by an\r\ningenious disposition, was fired each day at midday by the action of the\r\nsun's rays. All the world stood around awaiting the moment when watches\r\nmight be regulated for another twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Abbe Delille, to whom the beauties of the gardens were\r\nbeing shown, deplored the lack of good manners on the part of the\r\nhabitues and delivered himself of the following appropriate quatrain:\r\n\r\n   \"Dans ce jardin tout se rencontree\r\n   Excepte l'ombrage et les fleurs;\r\n   Si l'on y deregle ses moeurs\r\n   Du moins on y regle sa montre.\"\r\n\r\nThe Galerie de Bois was perhaps the most disreputable of all the palace\r\nconfines. It was a long, double row of booths which only disappeared\r\nwhen Louis-Philippe built the glass-covered Galerie d'Orleans.\r\n\r\nUp to the eve of the Revolution the Palais Royal enjoyed the same\r\nprivileges as the Temple and the Luxembourg, and became a sort of refuge\r\nwhereby those who sought to escape from the police might lose themselves\r\nin the throng. The monarch himself was obliged to ask permission of the\r\nDuc d'Orleans that his officials might pursue their police methods\r\nwithin the outer walls.\r\n\r\nIt was July 12, 1789. The evening before, Louis XVI had dismissed his\r\nminister, Neckar, but only on Sunday, the 12th, did the news get abroad.\r\nAt the same time it was learned that the regiment known as the Royal\r\nAllemand, under the orders of the Prince de Lambesc, had charged the\r\nmultitude gathered before the gates of the Tuileries. Cries of \"A Mort!\"\r\n\"Aux Armes!\" \"Vengeance!\" were hurled in air from all sides.\r\n\r\nAt high noon in the gardens of the Palais Royal, on the 13th, as the\r\nmidday sun was scorching the flagstones to a grilling temperature, the\r\nsound of a tiny cannon shot smote the still summer air with an echo\r\nwhich did not cease reverberating for months. The careless, unthinking\r\npromenaders suddenly grew grave, then violently agitated and finally\r\nraving, heedlessly mad. A young unknown limb of the law, Camille\r\nDesmoulins, rushed bareheaded and shrieking out of the Cafe de Foy,\r\nparted the crowd as a ship parts the waves, sprang upon a chair and\r\nharangued the multitude with such a vehemence and conviction that they\r\nwere with him as one man.\r\n\r\n\"Citizens,\" he said, \"I come from Versailles * * * It only remains for\r\nus to choose our colours. _Quelle couleur voulez vous?_ Green, the\r\ncolour of hope; or the blue of Cincinnati, the colour of American\r\nliberty and democracy.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Nous avons assez delibere!_ Deliberate further with our hands not our\r\nhearts! We are the party the most numerous: To arms!\"\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, the now famous 14th of July, the Frenchman's \"glorious\r\nfourteenth,\" the people rose and the Bastille fell.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary decree, in 1793, converted the palace and its garden into\r\nthe Palais et Jardin de la Revolution, and appropriated them as national\r\nproperty. Napoleon granted the palace to the Tribunal for its seat, and\r\nduring the Hundred Days Lucien Bonaparte took up his residence there. In\r\n1830 Louis Philippe d'Orleans gave a great fete here in honour of the\r\nKing of Naples who had come to the capital to pay his respects to the\r\nFrench king. Charles X, assisting at the ceremony as an invited guest,\r\nwas also present and a month later came again to actually inhabit the\r\npalace and make it royal once more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Galleries of the Palais-Royal under Napoleon First.]\r\n\r\nThe table herewith showing the ramifications of the Bourbon Orleans\r\nfamily in modern times is interesting--all collateral branches of the\r\ngenealogical tree sprouting from that of Louis Philippe. The heraldic\r\nembellishments of this family tree offer a particular interest in that\r\nthe armorial blazonings are in accord with a decree of the French\r\nTribunal, handed down a few years since, which establishes the right to\r\nthe head of the house to bear the _ecu plein de France--d'azur a trois\r\nfleurs de lys d'or_, thus establishing the Orleans legitimacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Republic of 1848 made the palace the headquarters of the Cour des\r\nComptes and of the Etat Major of the National Guard. Under Napoleon III\r\nthe Palais Royal became the dwelling of Prince Jerome, the uncle of the\r\nemperor. Later it served the same purpose for the son of Prince\r\nNapoleon. It was at this epoch that the desecration of scraping out the\r\nblazoned _lys_ and the chipping off the graven Bourbon _armoiries_ took\r\nplace. Whenever one or the other hated Bourbon symbol was found, eagles,\r\nphoenix-like, sprang up in their place, only in their turn to\r\ndisappear when the Republican device of '48 (now brought to light\r\nagain), _Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite_--replaced them.\r\n\r\nDuring the Commune of 1870 a part of the left wing and the central\r\npavilion suffered by fire, but restorations under the architect,\r\nChabrol, brought them back again to much their original outlines.\r\nThrough all its changes of tenure and political vicissitudes little\r\ntransformation took place as to the ground plan, or sky-line silhouette,\r\nof the chameleon palace of cardinal, king and emperor, and while in no\r\nsense is it architecturally imposing or luxurious, it is now, as ever in\r\nthe past, one of the most distinctive of Paris's public monuments.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Palais Royal proper may be said to face on Place du Palais\r\nRoyal, with its principal entrance at the end of a shallow courtyard\r\nseparated from the street by an iron grille and flanked by two\r\nunimposing pavilions. The principal facade hides the lodging of the\r\nConseil d'Etat and is composed of but the ground floor, a story above\r\nand an attic.\r\n\r\nThe Aile Montpensier, which follows on from the edifice which houses the\r\nComedie Francaise, was, until recently, occupied by the Cour des\r\nComptes. The Aile de Valois fronts the street of that name, and here the\r\nPrinces d'Orleans and King Jerome made their residence. To-day the same\r\nwing is devoted to the uses of the Under Secretary for the Beaux Arts.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to insist on, nor reiterate, the decadence of the\r\nPalais Royal. It is no longer the \"capitol of Paris,\" and whatever its\r\ncharms may be they are mostly equivocal. It is more a desert than an\r\noasis or a _temple de la volupte_, and it was each of these things in\r\nother days. Its priestesses and its gambling houses are gone, and who\r\nshall say this of itself is not a good thing in spite of the admitted\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nThe mediocrity of the Palais Royal is apparent to all who have the\r\nslightest acquaintance with the architectural orders, but for all that\r\nits transition from the Palais du Cardinal, Palais Egalite, Palais de\r\nla Revolution and Palais du Tribunat to the Palais Royal lends to it an\r\ninterest that many more gloriously artistic Paris edifices quite lack.\r\n\r\nThere is a movement on foot to-day to resurrect the Palais Royal to some\r\napproach to its former distinction, which is decidedly what it has not\r\nbeen for the past quarter of a century. Satirical persons have demanded\r\nas to what should be made of it, a _velodrome_ or a skating-rink, but\r\nthis is apart from a real consideration of the question for certain it\r\nis that much of its former charm can be restored to it without turning\r\nit into a Luna Park. It is one of the too few Paris breathing-spots, and\r\nas such should be made more attractive than it is at the present time.\r\n\r\nIt was sixty years ago, when Louis Philippe was the legitimate owner of\r\nthe Palais Royal, its galleries, its shops, its theatre and its gardens,\r\nthat it came to its first debasement. \"One went there on tip-toe, and\r\nspoke in a whisper,\" said a writer of the time, and one does not need to\r\nbe particularly astute to see the significance of the remark.\r\n\r\nIt was Alphonse Karr, the _ecrivain-jardinier_, who set the new vogue\r\nfor the Palais Royal, but his interest and enthusiasm was not enough to\r\nresurrect it, and so in later years it has sunk lower and lower. The\r\nsolitude of the Palais Royal has become a mockery and a solecism. It is\r\nvirtually a _campo santo_, or could readily be made one, and this in\r\nspite of the fact that it occupies one of the busiest and noisiest\r\nquarters of the capital, a quadrangle bounded by the Rues Valois,\r\nBeaujolais, Montpensier and the Place du Palais Royal.\r\n\r\nThe moment one enters its portal the simile accentuates and the hybrid\r\nshops which sell such equivocal bric-a-brac to clients of no taste and\r\nworse affectations carry out the idea of a cloister still further, for\r\nactually the clients are few, and those mostly strangers. One holds his\r\nbreath and ambles through the corridors glad enough to escape the bustle\r\nof the narrow streets which surround it, but, on the other hand, glad\r\nenough to get out into the open again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE LUXEMBOURG, THE ELYSEE AND THE PALAIS BOURBON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kings and queens of France were not only rulers of the nation, but\r\nthey dominated the life of the capital as well. Upon their crowning or\r\nentry into Paris it was the custom to command a gift by right from the\r\ninhabitants. In 1389 Isabeau de Baviere, of dire memory, got sixty\r\nthousand _couronnes d'or_, and in 1501, and again in 1504, was presented\r\nwith six thousand and ten thousand _livres parisis_ respectively.\r\n\r\nThe king levied personal taxes on the inhabitants, who were thus forced\r\nto pay for the privilege of having him live among them, those of the\r\nprofessions and craftsmen, who might from time to time serve the royal\r\nhousehold, paying the highest fees.\r\n\r\nIt was during the period of Richelieu's ministry that Paris flowered the\r\nmost profusely. The constructions of this epoch were so numerous and\r\nimposing that Corneille in his comedy \"Le Menteur,\" first produced in\r\n1642, made his characters speak thus:\r\n\r\n   Dorante: Paris semble a mes yeux un pays de roman\r\n          *       *       *\r\n   En superbes palais a change ses buissons\r\n          *       *       *\r\n   Aux superbes dehors du palais Cardinal\r\n   Tout la ville entiere, avec pomp batie\r\n          *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1701, Louis XIV divided the capital into twenty _quartiers_, or\r\nwards, and in 1726-1728 Louis XV built a new city wall; but it was only\r\nwith Louis XVI that the faubourgs were at last brought within the city\r\nlimits. Under the Empire and the Restoration but few changes were made,\r\nand with the piercing of the new boulevards under Napoleon III and Baron\r\nHaussmann the city came to be of much the same general plan that it is\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nIn the olden time, between the Palais de la Cite and the Louvre and the\r\nPalais des Tournelles, extending even to the walls of Charenton, was a\r\ngigantic garden, a carpet embroidered with as varied a colouring as the\r\n_tapis d'orient_ of the poets, and cut here and there by alleys which\r\nseparated it into little checker-board squares.\r\n\r\nWithin this maze was the celebrated Jardin Dedalus that Louis XI gave to\r\nCoictier, and above it rose the observatory of the savant like a signal\r\ntower of the Romans. This centered upon what is now the Place des\r\nVosges, formerly the Place Royale.\r\n\r\nTo-day, how changed is all this \"intermediate, indeterminate\" region!\r\nHow changed, indeed! There is nothing vague and indeterminate about it\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the little known Paris palaces was the Palais des\r\nThermes. It may be dismissed almost in a word from any consideration of\r\nthe royal dwellings of Paris, though it was the residence of several\r\nRoman emperors and two queens of France. A single apartment of the old\r\npalace of the Romans exists to-day--the old Roman Baths--but nothing of\r\nthe days of the Emperor Constantius Chlorus, who founded the palace in\r\nhonour of Julian who was proclaimed Emperor by his soldiers in 360 A.D.\r\nThe Frankish monarchs, if they ever resided here at all, soon\r\ntransferred their headquarters to the Palais de la Cite, the ruins\r\nfalling into the possession of the monks of Cluny, who built the present\r\nHotel de Cluny on the site.\r\n\r\nOf all the minor French palaces the Luxembourg and the Elysee are the\r\nmost often heard of in connection with the life of modern times. The\r\nfirst is something a good deal more than an art museum, and the latter\r\nmore than the residence for the Republican president, though the\r\nguide-book makers hardly think it worth while to write down the facts.\r\n\r\nThe Palais du Luxembourg has been called an imitation of the Pitti\r\nPalace at Florence, but, beyond the fact that it was an Italian\r\nconception of Marie de Medici's, it is difficult to follow the\r\nsuggestion, as the architect, Jacques Debrosse, one of the ablest of\r\nFrenchmen in his line, simply carried out the work on the general plan\r\nof the time of its building, the early seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIts three not very extensive pavilions are joined together by a\r\ncolonnade which encloses a rather foreboding flagged courtyard, a\r\nconception, or elaboration, of the original edifice by Chalgrin, in\r\n1804, under the orders of Napoleon. The garden front, though a\r\nrestoration of Louis Philippe, is more in keeping with the original\r\nMedici plan; that, at any rate, is to its credit.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Luxembourg, the Republican Palais du Senat, is but an echo of\r\nthe four centuries of aristocratic existence which upheld the name and\r\nfame of its first proprietor, the Duc de Piney-Luxembourg, Prince de\r\nTigry, who built it in the sixteenth century. From 1733 to 1736 the\r\npalace underwent important restorations and the last persons to inhabit\r\nit before the Revolution were the Duchesse de Brunswick, the Queen\r\nDowager of Spain and the Comte de Provence, brother of Louis XVI, to\r\nwhom it had been given by Letters Patent in 1779.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Palais du Luxembourg_]\r\n\r\nIn 1791 the Convention thought so little of it that they made it a\r\nprison, and a few years later it was called again the Palais du\r\nDirectoire, and, before the end of the century, the Palais du Consulat.\r\nThis was but a brief glory, as Napoleon transferred his residence in\r\naccordance with his augmenting ambitions, to the Tuileries in the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nBy 1870 the edifice had become known as the Palais du Senat, then as the\r\nheadquarters of the Prefecture of the Seine, and finally, as to-day, the\r\nPalais du Luxembourg, the seat of the French Senate and the residence of\r\nthe president of that body.\r\n\r\nThe principal public apartments are the Library, the \"Salle des\r\nSeances,\" the \"Buvette\"--formerly Napoleon's \"Cabinet de Travail,\" the\r\n\"Salle des Pas Perdus\"--formerly the \"Salle du Trone,\" the Grand Gallery\r\nand the apartments of Marie de Medici. The chapel is modern and dates\r\nonly from 1844.\r\n\r\nThe Palais du Petit Luxembourg is the official residence of the\r\npresident of the Senate and dates also from the time of Marie de Medici.\r\nThe picture gallery is housed in a modern structure to the west of the\r\nPetit Luxembourg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe facade of the Palais du Senat is not altogether lovely and has\r\nlittle suggestion of the daintiness of the Petit Luxembourg, but,\r\nfor all that, it presents a certain dignified pose and the edifice\r\nserves its purpose well as the legislative hall of the upper house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Petit Luxembourg_]\r\n\r\nThe gardens of the Luxembourg form another of those favourite Paris\r\nplaygrounds for nursemaids and their charges. It is claimed that the\r\nchildren are all little Legitimists in the Luxembourg gardens, whereas\r\nthey are all Red Republicans at the Tuileries. One has no means of\r\nknowing this with certainty, but it is assumed; at any rate the\r\nLegitimists are a very numerous class in the neighbourhood. Another\r\nclass of childhood to be seen here is that composed of the offsprings of\r\nartists and professors of the Latin quarter, and of the active tradesmen\r\nof the neighbourhood. They come here, like the others, for the fresh\r\nair, to see a bit of greenery, to hear the band play, to sail their\r\nboats in the basins of the great fountain and enjoy themselves\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nOne notes a distinct difference in the dress and manners of the children\r\nof the gardens of the Luxembourg from those of the Tuileries and wonders\r\nif the breach will be widened further as they grow up.\r\n\r\nThe Jardin du Luxembourg is all that a great city garden should be,\r\nample, commodious, decorative and as thoroughly typical of Paris as the\r\nPont Neuf. Innumerable, but rather mediocre, statues are posed here and\r\nthere between the palace and the observatory at the end of the long,\r\ntree-lined avenue which stretches off to the south, the only really\r\nhistorical monument of this nature being the celebrated Fontaine de\r\nMedicis by Debrosse, the architect of the palace. It was a memorial to\r\nMarie de Medici.\r\n\r\nWhile one is in this quarter of Paris he has an opportunity to recall a\r\nroyal memory now somewhat dimmed by time, but still in evidence if one\r\nwould delve deep.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, royalty never had much to do with this hybrid\r\nquarter of Paris, though, indeed, its past was romantic enough,\r\nbordering as it does upon the real Latin Quarter of the students.\r\nBounded on one side by the immense domain of the Luxembourg, it\r\nstretched away indefinitely beyond Vaugiraud, almost to Clamart and\r\nSceaux.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Luxembourg Gardens_]\r\n\r\nAt No. 27 Boulevard Montparnasse is an elaborate seventeenth house-front\r\nhalf hidden by the \"modern style\" flats of twentieth century Paris. This\r\nrelic of the _grand siecle_, with its profusion of sculptured details,\r\nwas the house bought by Louis XIV about 1672 and given to the \"widow\r\nScarron,\" the \"young and beautiful widow of the court,\" as a\r\nrecompense for the devotion with which she had educated the three\r\nchildren of the Marquise de Montespan, who, in 1673, were legitimatized\r\nas princes of the royal house--the Duc de Maine, the Comte de Vexin and\r\nMademoiselle de Mantes.\r\n\r\nMadame Scarron, who became in time Madame de Maintenon, the \"_vraie\r\nreine du roi_,\" died in 1719, and the house passed to La Tour\r\nd'Auvergne.\r\n\r\nOn this same side of the river are the Palais de l'Institut and the\r\nPalais Bourbon. The Palais de l'Institut, or Palais Mazarin, is hardly\r\nto be considered one of the domestic establishments, the dwellings of\r\nkings, with which contemporary Paris was graced. It was but a creation\r\nof Mazarin, the minister, on the site of the Hotel de Nesle, and was\r\nfirst known as the Palais des Quatre Nations, where were educated, at\r\nthe expense of the Cardinal, sixty young men of various nationalities.\r\n\r\nThe old chapel has since been transformed into the \"Salle des Seances\"\r\nof the Institut de France, the Five French Academies. The black, gloomy\r\nfacade of the edifice, to-day, in spite of the cupola which gives a\r\ncertain inspiring dignity, is not lovely, and tradition and sentiment\r\nalone give it its present interest, though it is undeniably\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\nAn inscription used to be on the pedestal of one of the fountains\r\nopposite the entrance which read:\r\n\r\n   \"Superbe habitant du desert\r\n   En ce lieu, dis moi, que fais tu\r\n   --Tu le vois a mon habit vert\r\n   Je suis membre de l'institut.\"\r\n\r\nIf the inscription were still there it would save the asking of a lot of\r\nsilly questions by strangers who pass this way for the first time. The\r\nPalais de l'Institut is one of the sights of Paris, and its functions\r\nare notable, though hardly belonging to the romantic school of past\r\ndays, for at present poets often make their entree via Montmartre's\r\n\"Chat Noir,\" or are elected simply because some other candidate has been\r\n\"_blackbouled_.\"\r\n\r\nStill following along the left bank of the Seine one comes to the Palais\r\nBourbon, the Chambre des Deputes, as it is better known. This edifice,\r\nwhere now sit the French deputies, was built by Girardini for the\r\nDowager Duchesse de Bourbon in 1722, and, though much changed during\r\nvarious successive eras, is still a unique variety of architectural\r\nembellishment which is not uncouth, nor yet wholly appealing. Napoleon\r\nremade the heavily imposing facade, so familiar to all who cross the\r\nriver by the Pont de la Concorde, but its grimness is its charm rather\r\nthan its grace.\r\n\r\nThe structure cost its first proprietor twenty million or more francs,\r\nand since it has become national property the outlay has been constant.\r\nEverything considered it makes a poor showing; but its pseudo-Greek\r\nfacade, were it removed, would certainly be missed in this section of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThe principal apartments are the \"Salle des Pas Perdus,\" the \"Salle des\r\nSeances,\" and the \"Salle des Conferences\"--where, in 1830, the Duc\r\nd'Orleans took the oath as king of France.\r\n\r\nA recent discovery has been made in the lumber room of this old Palais\r\nBourbon, where deputies howl and shout and make laws as noisily as in\r\nany other of the world's parliaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The THRONE of the PALAIS-BOURBON]\r\n\r\nThis particular \"find\" was the throne constructed in 1816 for Louis\r\nXVIII, with its upholstering of velvet embroidered with the golden\r\nfleur-de-lis. The records tell that this throne also served Louis\r\nPhilippe under the Second Empire, and also was used under the Monarchy\r\nof July. It was after the momentous \"Quatre Setembre\" that it was\r\nfinally relegated to the garret, but now, as a historical souvenir of\r\nthe first rank, it has been placed prominently where all who visit the\r\nPalais Bourbon may see it.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Palais de l'Elysee has not been particularly vivid,\r\nthough for two centuries it has played a most important part in the life\r\nof the capital. In later years it has served well enough the\r\npresidential dignity of the chief magistrate of the French Republic and\r\nis thus classed as a national property. Actually, since its\r\nconstruction, it has changed its name as often as it has changed its\r\noccupants. Its first occupant was its builder, Louis d'Auvergne, Comte\r\nd'Evreux, who built himself this great town house on a plot of land\r\nwhich had been given him by Louis XV. Apparently the young man had no\r\nmeans of his own for the construction of his luxurious city dwelling,\r\nfor he refilled his coffers by marriage with the rich daughter of the\r\nfinancier Crozat.\r\n\r\nThe new-made countess's mother-in-law apparently never had much respect\r\nfor her son's choice as she forever referred to her as \"the little gold\r\ningot.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ingot\" served to construct the palace, however, though at the death\r\nof its builder, soon after, it came into the proprietorship of La\r\nPompadour, who spent the sum of six hundred and fifty thousand _livres_\r\nin aggrandizing it. It became her town house, whither she removed when\r\nshe grew tired of Versailles or Bagatelle.\r\n\r\nHistory tells of an incident in connection with a fete given at the\r\nPalais de l'Elysee by La Pompadour. It was at the epoch of the\r\n\"_bergeries a la Watteau_.\" The blond Pompadour had the idea of\r\nintroducing into the salons a troop of living, sad-eyed sheep, combed\r\nand curled like the poodles in the carriages of the fashionables in the\r\nBois to-day. The quadrupeds, greatly frightened by the flood of light,\r\nfell into a panic, and the largest ram among them, seeing his duplicate\r\nin a mirror, made for it in the traditional ram-like manner. He raged\r\nfor an hour or more from one apartment to another, followed by the whole\r\nflock, which committed incalculable damage before it could be turned\r\ninto the gardens. Such was one of the costly caprices of La Pompadour.\r\nShe had many.\r\n\r\nLa Pompadour's brother, the Marquis de Menars et de Marigny, continued\r\nthe work of embellishment of the property up to the day when Louis XV\r\nbought it as a dwelling for the ambassadors to his court. Its somewhat\r\nrestricted park, ornamented with a grotto and a cascade, was at this\r\ntime one of the curiosities of the capital.\r\n\r\nIn 1773, the financier Beaujon bought the property from the king and\r\nadded considerably to it under the direction of the architect Boullee,\r\nwho also re-designed the gardens. Thanks to Beaujon, the wonderful\r\nGobelins of to-day were hung upon the walls, and many paintings by\r\nRubens, Poissin, Van Loo, Von Ostade, Murillo, Paul Potter and Joseph\r\nVernet were added.\r\n\r\nThe death of the financier brought the property into the hands of the\r\nDuchesse de Bourbon, the sister of Louis Philippe, and the mother of the\r\nDuc d' Enghien, who died so tragically at Vincennes a short time after.\r\nThe duchess renamed her new possession Elysee-Bourbon and there led a\r\nvery retired and sad life among surroundings so splendid that they\r\nmerited a more gay existence.\r\n\r\nAt the Revolution the palace became a national property, and, under the\r\nConsulate, was the scene of many popular fetes, it having been rented to\r\na concern which arranged balls and other entertainments for the pleasure\r\nof all who could afford to pay. Its name was now the Hameau de\r\nChantilly, and, considering that the entrance tickets cost but fifteen\r\nsous--including a drink--it must have proved a cheap, satisfying and\r\nsplendid amusement for the people.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs lasted until 1805, when Murat bought it and here\r\nheld his little court up to his departure for Naples, when, in\r\ngratefulness for past favours, he gave it to Napoleon. The emperor\r\ngreatly loved this new abode, which he rechristened the Elysee-Napoleon.\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat at Waterloo Napoleon, limping lamely Parisward, down\r\nthrough the Forests of Compiegne and Villers-Cotterets, sought in the\r\nElysee-Napoleon the repose and rest which he so much needed, the throng\r\nmeanwhile promenading before the palace windows, shouting at the tops of\r\ntheir voices \"Vive l'Empereur!\" though, as the world well knew, his\r\npower had waned forever; the eagle's wings were broken. The throng still\r\ncrowded the precincts of the palace, but the emperor fled secretly by\r\nthe garden gate.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Duchesse de Bourbon from Spain the magnificent\r\nstructure became again the Elysee-Bourbon. The duchess ceded the palace\r\nto the Duc and Duchesse de Berry but, at the duke's death, in 1820, his\r\nwidow abandoned it.\r\n\r\nSome time after it was occupied by the Duc de Bordeaux, and, in 1830,\r\nit became one of the long list of establishments whose maintenance\r\ndevolved upon the Civil List, though it remained practically uninhabited\r\nall through the reign of Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, the National Assembly designated the palace as the official\r\nresidence for the presidents of the French Republic. Three years after,\r\non the night of the first of December, as the last preparations were\r\nbeing made by Louis Bonaparte for the Coup d' Etat and the final\r\nstrangling of the young republic, the residence of the president was\r\ntransferred to the Tuileries, and the palace of the Faubourg Saint\r\nHonore was again left without a tenant, and served only to give\r\nhospitality from time to time to passing notables.\r\n\r\nAfter the burning of the Tuileries, and the coming of the Third\r\nRepublic, the Elysee Palace again became the presidential residence, and\r\nso it remains to-day.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable of modern events connected with the Elysee\r\nPalace was the _diner de ceremonie_ offered by the president of the\r\nRepublic and Madame Fallieres to Mr. and Mrs. Roosevelt in April, 1910.\r\nThe dinner was served in the \"Grand Salle des Fetes\" and the music which\r\naccompanied the repast was furnished by the band of the _Garde\r\nRepublicain_, beginning with the national anthem of America and\r\nfinishing with that of France. Never had a private citizen, a foreigner,\r\nbeen so received by the first magistrate of France. The toast of\r\nPresident Fallieres was as follows: \"Before this repast terminates I\r\nwish to profit by the occasion offered to drink the health of Monsieur\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, an illustrious man, a great citizen and a good\r\nfriend of France and the cause of peace. I raise my glass to Madame\r\nRoosevelt who may be assured of our respectful and sympathetic homage,\r\nand I am very glad to be able to say to our guests that we count\r\nourselves very fortunate in being allowed to meet them in person and\r\nshow them this mark of respect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nVINCENNES AND CONFLANS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINCENNES UNDER CHARLES V]\r\n\r\n\r\nVincennes is to-day little more than a dull, dirty Paris suburb; if\r\nanything its complexion is a deeper drab than that of Saint Denis, and\r\nto call the Bois de Vincennes a park \"somewhat resembling the Bois de\r\nBoulogne,\" as do the guidebooks, is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIn reality Vincennes is nothing at all except a memory. There is to-day\r\nlittle suggestion of royal origin about the smug and murky surroundings\r\nof the Chateau de Vincennes; but nevertheless, it once was a royal\r\nresidence, and the drama which unrolled itself within its walls was most\r\nvividly presented. A book might be written upon it, with the following\r\nas the chapter headings: \"The Royal Residence,\" \"The Minimes of the\r\nBois de Vincennes,\" \"Mazarin at Vincennes,\" \"The Prisoners of the\r\nDonjon,\" \"The Fetes of the Revolution,\" \"The Death of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien,\" \"The Transformation of the Chateau and the Bois.\"\r\n\r\nIts plots are ready-made, but one has to take them on hearsay, for the\r\nold chateau does not open its doors readily to the stranger for the\r\nreason that it to-day ranks only as a military fortress, and an\r\nartillery camp is laid out in the quadrangle, intended, if need be, to\r\naid in the defence of Paris. This is one of the things one hears about,\r\nbut of which one may not have any personal knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe first reference to the name of Vincennes is in a ninth century\r\ncharter, where it appears as _Vilcenna_. The foundation of the original\r\nchateau-fort on the present site is attributed to Louis VII, who, in\r\n1164, having alienated a part of the neighbouring forest in favour of a\r\nbody of monks, built himself a suburban rest-house under shelter of the\r\npious walls of their convent.\r\n\r\nPhilippe Auguste, too, has been credited with being the founder of\r\nVincennes; but, at all events, the chateau took on no royal importance\r\nuntil the reign of Saint Louis, who acquired the habit of dispensing\r\njustice to all comers seated beneath an oak in the near-by Forest of\r\nJoinville.\r\n\r\nThe erection of the later chateau was begun by Charles, Comte de Valois,\r\nbrother of Philippe-le-Bel; and it was completed by Philippe VI of\r\nValois, and his successor, Jean-le-Bon, between the years 1337 and 1370,\r\nwhen it became an entirely new manner of edifice from what it had been\r\nbefore. It was in this chateau that was born Charles V, to whom indeed\r\nit owes its completion in the form best known.\r\n\r\nTo-day, the outlines of the mass of the Chateau de Vincennes are\r\nconsiderably abbreviated from their former state. Originally it was\r\nquite regular in outline, its walls forming a rectangle flanked by nine\r\ntowers, the great donjon which one sees to-day occupying the centre of\r\none side. The chapel was begun in the reign of Francois I and terminated\r\nin that of Henri II. Its coloured glass, painted by Jean Cousin from the\r\ndesigns of Raphael, is notable.\r\n\r\nThe chapel at Vincennes, with the Saint Chapelle of the Palais de\r\nJustice at Paris, ranks as one of the most exquisite examples extant of\r\nFrench Gothic architecture. It was begun in 1379, but chiefly it is of\r\nthe sixteenth century, since it was only completed in 1552. This chapel\r\nof the sixteenth century, and the two side wings flanking the tower of\r\nthe reign of Louis XIV, make the Chateau de Vincennes a most precious\r\nspecimen of mediaeval ecclesiastical and military architecture. If\r\nNapoleon had not cut down the height of the surrounding walls the\r\ncomparison would be still more favourable. In the reproduction of the\r\nminiature from the Book of Hours of the Duc de Berry given herein one\r\nsees the perfect outlines of the fourteenth century edifice.\r\n\r\nIn later years, Louis XIII added considerably to the existing structure,\r\nbut little is now to be seen of that edifice save the great tower and\r\nthe chapel.\r\n\r\nCharles IX, whose royal edict brought forth the bloody night of Saint\r\nBartholomew in 1572, fell sick two years later in the Chateau de\r\nVincennes. Calling his surgeon, Ambroise Pare, to his side he exclaimed:\r\n\"My body burns with fever; I see the mangled Huguenots all about me;\r\nHoly Virgin, how they mock me; I wish, Pare, I had spared them.\" And\r\nthus he died, abhorring the mother who had counselled him to commit this\r\nhorrible deed.\r\n\r\nThe donjon of Vincennes was carried to its comparatively great height\r\nthat it might serve as a tower of observation as well as a place of last\r\nretreat if in an attack the outer walls of the fortress should give way.\r\nHere at Vincennes a certain massiveness is noted in connection with the\r\ndonjon, though the actual ground area which it covers is not very\r\ngreat; it was not like many donjons of the time, which were virtually\r\nsmaller chateaux or fortresses enclosed within a greater.\r\n\r\nVincennes, in comparison with many other contemporary edifices,\r\npossessed a certain regularity of outline which was made possible by its\r\nfavourable situation. When others were of fantastic form, they were\r\nusually so built because of the configuration of the land, or the nature\r\nof the soil. But here the land was flat, and, though the edifice and its\r\ndependencies covered no very extended area, they followed rectangular\r\nlines with absolute precision.\r\n\r\nAs its walls were of a thickness of three metres, it was a work easy of\r\naccomplishment for Louis XI to turn the chateau into a Prison of State,\r\na use to which the first chateau had actually been put by the shutting\r\nup in it of Enguerrand de Marigny. Henri IV, in 1574, passed some\r\nsolitary hours and days within its walls, and Mirabeau did the same in\r\n1777. The Duc d'Enghien, under the First Empire, before his actual death\r\nby shooting, suffered sorely herein, while resting under an unjust\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chateau de Vincennes_]\r\n\r\nIn 1814-1815 the chateau became a great arsenal and general storehouse\r\nfor the army. It was attacked by the Allies and besieged twice, but in\r\nvain. It was defended against the armies of Blucher by the Baron\r\nDaumesnil. Summoned to surrender his charge, \"Jambe de Bois\" (so called\r\nbecause he had lost a leg the year before) replied: \"I will surrender\r\nwhen you surrender to me my leg.\" A statue to this brave warrior is\r\nwithin the chateau, and commemorates further the fact that he\r\ncapitulated only on terms laid down by himself out of his humane regard\r\nfor the lives of friends and foes.\r\n\r\nThe ministers of Charles X, in 1830, had cause to regret the strength of\r\nthe chateau walls; and Barbes, Blanqui and Raspail, in 1848, and various\r\nRepublicans, who had been seized as dangerous elements of society after\r\nthe Coup d'Etat of 1851, also here found an enforced hospitality. The\r\nChateau de Vincennes had become a second Bastille.\r\n\r\nThe incident of the arrest and death of the Duc d'Enghien is one of the\r\nmost dramatic in Napoleonic history. The scene was Vincennes. Louis\r\nAntoine Henri de Bourbon, son of the Prince de Conde, born at Chantilly\r\nin 1772, became, without just reason, suspected in connection with the\r\nCadoudal-Pichegreu plot, and was seized by a squadron of cavalry at the\r\nSchloss Ettenheim in the Duchy of Baden and conducted to Vincennes.\r\nHere, after a summary judgment, he was shot at night in the moat behind\r\nthe guardhouse. The obscurity of the night was so great that a lighted\r\nlantern was hung around the neck of the unfortunate man that the\r\nsoldiers might the better see the mark at which they were to shoot.\r\n\r\nNapoleon confided to Josephine, who repeated the secret to Madame de\r\nRemusat, that his political future demanded a _coup d'Etat_. On the\r\nmorning of the execution, the emperor, awakening at five o'clock, said\r\nto Josephine: \"By this time the Duc d'Enghien has passed from this\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest is history--of that apologetic kind which is not often\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nIn the chapel at Vincennes a commemorative tablet was placed, by the\r\norders of Louis XVIII, in 1816, to mark the death of the young duke.\r\n\r\nThe Bois de Vincennes is not the fashionable parade ground of the Bois\r\nde Boulogne. On the whole it is a sad sort of a public park, and not at\r\nall fashionable, and not particularly attractive, though of a vast\r\nextent and possessed of a profoundly historic past of far more\r\nsignificance than that of its sweet sister by the opposite gates of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Hunt under the Walls of Vincennes_\r\n\r\n_From a Fourteenth Century Print_]\r\n\r\nIt contains ten hundred and sixty-nine hectares and was due originally\r\nto Louis XV, who sought to have a sylvan gateway to the city from the\r\neast. Under the Second Empire the park was considerably transformed, new\r\nroads and alleys traced, and an effort made to have it equal more\r\nnearly the beauty of the more popular Bois de Boulogne. It occupies the\r\nplateau lying between the Seine and the bend in the Marne, just above\r\nthe junction of the two rivers.\r\n\r\nThere are some forty kilometres of roadway within the limits of the Bois\r\nde Vincennes, and a dozen kilometres or more of footpaths; but, since\r\nthe military authorities have taken a portion for their own uses as a\r\ntraining ground, a shooting range and for the Batteries of La\r\nFaisanderie and Gravelle, it has been bereft of no small part of its\r\nformer charm. There are three lakes in the Bois, the Lac de Sainte\r\nMande, the Lac Daumesnil and the Lac de Gravelle.\r\n\r\nA near neighbour of Vincennes is Conflans, another poor, rent relic of\r\nmonarchial majesty. The Chateau de Conflans was situated at the juncture\r\nof the Seine and Marne, but, to-day, the immediate neighbourhood is so\r\nvery unlovely and depressing that one can hardly believe that it ever\r\npleased any one's fancy, least of all that of a kingly castle builder.\r\n\r\nBanal dwellings on all sides are Conflans' chief characteristics to-day;\r\nbut the old royal abode still lifts a long length of roof and wall to\r\nmark the spot where once stood the Chateau de Conflans in all its\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nConflans was at first the country residence of the Archbishops of Paris,\r\nand Saint Louis frequently went into retreat here. When Philippe-le-Bel\r\nacquired the property, he promptly gave it to the Comtesse d'Artois who\r\nmade of it one of the \"_plus beaux castels du temps_.\" She decorated its\r\nlong gallery, the portion of the edifice which exists to-day in the\r\nhumble, emasculated form of a warehouse of some sort, in memory of her\r\nhusband Othon. Here the countess held many historic receptions and\r\nceremonies during which kings and princes frequently partook of her\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONFLANS from an OLD PRINT.]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the countess, the French king made his residence at\r\nConflans, and Charles VI, when dauphin, was also lodged here that he\r\nmight be near the capital in case of events which might require his\r\npresence. A contemporary account mentions the fact that his _valet de\r\nchambre_ was killed by lightning at Conflans while serving his royal\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nConflans was the preferred suburban residence of the Princes and the\r\nDucs de Bourgogne, and Philippe-le-Hardi there organized his tourneys\r\nand his _passes d'armes_ with great eclat, on one occasion alone\r\noffering one hundred and fifteen thousand _livres_ in prizes to the\r\nparticipants.\r\n\r\nThis castle, for it was more castle than palace, was reputed one of the\r\nmost magnificent in the neighbourhood of the Paris of its time,\r\nsurrounded as it was with a resplendent garden and a forest in\r\nminiature, really a part of the Bois de Vincennes of to-day, where\r\nroamed wild boar and wolves which furnished sport of a kingly kind.\r\n\r\nThe view from the terrace of the chateau must have been wonderfully\r\nfine, the towers and roof-tops of old Paris being silhouetted against\r\nthe setting sun, its windows dominating the swift-flowing current of the\r\ntwo rivers at the foot of the fortress walls.\r\n\r\nThe greatest event of history enacted under the walls of Conflans was\r\nthe battle and the treaty which followed after, between Louis XI and the\r\nComte de Charolais, in 1405.\r\n\r\nCommynes recounts the battle as follows: \"Four thousand archers were\r\nsent out from Paris by the king, who fired upon the castle from the\r\nriver bank on both sides.\"\r\n\r\nBows and arrows were hardly effective weapons with which to shoot down\r\ncastle walls, but stragglers who left themselves unprotected were from\r\ntime to time picked off on both sides and much carnage actually ensued.\r\nFinally a treaty of peace was arranged, by which, at the death of\r\nCharles-le-Temeraire, according to usage, Louis XI absorbed the\r\nproprietary rights in the castle and made it a _Maison Royale_,\r\nbestowing it upon one of his favourites, Dame Gillette Hennequin.\r\n\r\nThe kings of France about this time developed a predilection for the\r\nchateaux on the banks of the Loire, and Conflans was offered for sale in\r\n1554. Divers personages occupied it from that time on, the Marechal de\r\nVilleroy, the Connetable de Montmorency and, for a brief time, Cardinal\r\nRichelieu.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Chateau de Conflans that was planned the foundation of the\r\nFrench Academy; here Moliere and his players first presented \"La\r\nCritique de l'Ecole des Femmes\"; and here, also, was held the marriage\r\nof La Grande Mademoiselle with the unhappy Lauzan.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the reign of Louis XIV Fr. de Harlay-Chauvallon,\r\nArchbishop of Paris, bought the property of Richelieu, and, with the\r\naid of Mansart and Le Notre, considerably embellished it within and\r\nwithout. Madame de Sevigne, in one of her many published letters, writes\r\nof the splendours which she saw at Conflans at this epoch.\r\n\r\nSaint-Simon, the court chronicler, mentions that the gardens were so\r\nimmaculately kept that when the Archbishop and \"La Belle\" Duchesse de\r\nLesdiguieres used to promenade therein they were followed by a gardener\r\nwho, with a rake, sought to remove the traces of each footprint as soon\r\nas made.\r\n\r\nLater, the Cardinal de Beaumont, the persecutor of the Jansenists,\r\nresided here.\r\n\r\n   \"Notre archeveque est a Conflans\r\n      C'est un grand solitaire\r\n         C'est un grand so\r\n         C'est un grand so\r\n       C'est un grand solitaire.\"\r\n\r\nThe above verse is certainly banal enough, but the cardinal himself was\r\na _drole_, so perhaps it is appropriate. At any rate it is contemporary\r\nwith the churchman's sojourn at Conflans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFONTAINEBLEAU AND ITS FOREST\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORIGINAL PLAN OF FONTAINEBLEAU]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the French royal palaces Fontainebleau is certainly the most\r\ninteresting, despite the popularity and accessibility of Versailles. It\r\nis moreover the cradle of the French Renaissance. Napoleon called it the\r\nMaison des Siecles, and the simile was just.\r\n\r\nAfter Versailles, Fontainebleau has ever held the first place among the\r\nsuburban royal palaces. The celebrated \"Route de Fontainebleau\" of\r\nhistory was as much a _Chemin du Roi_ as that which led from the capital\r\nto Versailles. Versailles was gorgeous, even splendid, if you will;\r\nbut it had not the unique characteristics, nor winsomeness of\r\nFontainebleau, nor ever will have, in the minds of those who know and\r\nlove the France of monarchial days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Paris to Fontainebleau]\r\n\r\nNot the least of the charm of Fontainebleau is the neighbouring forest\r\nso close at hand, a few garden railings, not more, separating the palace\r\nfrom one of the wildest forest tracts of modern France.\r\n\r\nThe Forest of Fontainebleau is full of memories of royal rendezvous, the\r\ncarnage of wild beasts, the \"_vraie image de la guerre_,\" of which the\r\nRenaissance kings were so inordinately fond.\r\n\r\nIt was from the Palace of Fontainebleau, too, that bloomed forth the\r\nbest and most wholesome of the French Renaissance architecture. It was\r\nthe model of all other later residences of its kind. It took the best\r\nthat Italy had to offer and developed something so very French that even\r\nthe Italian workmen, under the orders of Francois I, all but lost their\r\nnationality. Vasari said of it that it \"rivalled the best work to be\r\nfound in the Rome of its time.\"\r\n\r\nA charter of Louis-le-Jeune (Louis VII), dated at Fontainebleau in 1169,\r\nattests that the spot was already occupied by a _maison royale_ which,\r\naccording to the Latin name given in the document was called Fontene\r\nBleaudi, an etymology not difficult to trace when what we know of its\r\nearlier and later history is considered.\r\n\r\nActually this _fontaine belle eau_ is found to-day in the centre of the\r\nJardin Anglais, its basin and outlet being surrounded by the\r\nconventional stone rim or border. After its discovery, according to\r\nlegend, this fountain became the rendezvous of the gallants and the\r\npoets and painters and the \"sweet ladies\" so often referred to in the\r\nchronicles of the Renaissance. Rosso, the painter, perpetuated one of\r\nthe most celebrated of these reunions in his decorations in the Galerie\r\nFrancois I in the palace, and Cellini represented the fair huntress\r\nDiana, amid the same surroundings.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis-le-Jeune in 1169 was erected, in the Cour du Donjon, the\r\nchapel Saint-Saturnin, which was consecrated by Saint Thomas a Becket,\r\nthen a refugee in France.\r\n\r\nPhilippe Auguste and Saint Louis inhabited the palace and\r\nPhilippe-le-Bel died here in 1314. From a letter of Charles VII it\r\nappears that Isabeau de Baviere had the intention of greatly adding to\r\nthe existing chateau because of the extreme healthfulness of the\r\nneighbourhood. The work was actually begun but seemingly not carried to\r\nany great length.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when Francois I came into his own and,\r\nbecause of the supreme beauty of the site, became enamoured of it and\r\nbegan to erect an edifice which was to outrank all others of its class.\r\nThe king and court made of Fontainebleau a second capital. It was a\r\nmodel residence of its kind, and gave the first great impetus to the\r\nRenaissance wave which rose so rapidly that it speedily engulfed all\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nAside from its palace and its forest, Fontainebleau early became a noble\r\nand a gracious town, thanks to the proximity of the royal dwelling. In\r\nspite of the mighty scenes enacted within its walls, the palace has ever\r\nposed as one of the most placid and tranquil places of royal residence\r\nin the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAll this is true to-day, in spite of the coming of tourists in\r\nautomobiles, and the recent establishment of a golf club with the usual\r\nappurtenances. Fontainebleau, the town, has a complexion quite its own.\r\nIts garrison and its little court of officialdom give it a character\r\nwhich even to-day marks it as one of the principal places where the\r\nstranger may observe the French dragoon, with _casque_ and breastplate\r\nand boots and spurs, at quite his romantic best, though it is apparent\r\nto all that the cumbersome, if picturesque, uniform is an unwieldy\r\nfighting costume. There was talk long ago of suppressing the corps, but\r\nall Fontainebleau rose up in protest. As the popular _chanson_ has it:\r\n\"_Laissez les dragons a leur Maire_.\" This has become the battle cry and\r\nso they remain at Fontainebleau to-day, the envy of their fellows in the\r\nservice, and the glory of the young misses of the boarding schools, who\r\neach Saturday are brought out in droves to see the sights.\r\n\r\nMany descriptions of Fontainebleau have been written, but the works of\r\nPoirson, Pfnor and Champollion-Figeac are generally followed by most\r\nmakers of guidebooks, and, though useful, they have perpetuated many\r\nerrors which were known to have been doubtful even before their day.\r\n\r\nThe best account of Fontainebleau under Francois I is given in the\r\nmanuscript memoir of Abbe Guilbert. Apparently an error crept into this\r\nadmirable work, too, for it gives the date of the commencement of the\r\nconstructions of Francois as 1514, whereas that monarch only ascended\r\nthe throne in 1515. The date of the first works under this monarch was\r\n1528, according to a letter of the king himself, which began: \"We, the\r\ncourt, intend to live in this palace and hunt the _'betes rousses et\r\nnoirs qui sont dans la foret.'_\"\r\n\r\nAn account of Francois I and his \"young Italian friends\" makes mention\r\nof the visit of the king, in company with the Duchesse d'Etampes, to the\r\nstudio of Serlio who was working desperately on the portico of the Cour\r\nOvale. He found the artist producing a \"melody of plastic beauty, garbed\r\nas a simple workman, his hair matted with pasty clay.\" He was standing\r\non a scaffolding high above the ground when the monarch mounted the\r\nladder. Up aloft Francois held a conference with his beloved workman\r\nand, descending, shouted back the words: \"You understand, Maitre Serlio;\r\nlet it be as you suggest.\" After the porticos, Serlio decorated the\r\nGalerie d'Ulysse which has since disappeared owing to the indifference\r\nof Louis XV and the imbecility of his friends; and always it was with\r\nFrancois: \"You understand, Maitre Serlio; it is as you wish.\" The\r\n_motif_ may have been Italian, but the impetus for the work was given by\r\nthe _esprit_ of the French.\r\n\r\nThe defeated monarch was not able to bring away from Padua any trophies\r\nof war; but he brought plans of chateaux, and gardens as well. He did\r\nmore: he took the very artists and craftsmen who had produced many of\r\nthe Italian masterpieces of the time.\r\n\r\nThe tracing of the gardens at Fontainebleau, practically as they exist\r\nto-day, was one of Francois I's greatest pleasures. In their midst, on\r\nthe shores of the Etang aux Carpes, was erected a tiny rest-house where\r\nthe royal mistresses might come to repose and laugh at the jests of\r\nTriboulet.\r\n\r\nThe edifice of Francois I is of modest proportions and of perfect unity;\r\nbut it is with difficulty that it presents its best appearance,\r\noverpowered as it is by the heavier masses of the time of Henri IV, and\r\nsuffering as it does because of the eliminations of Louis XIV and Louis\r\nXV when they made their additions to the palace.\r\n\r\nUnder the Convention, later on, Fontainebleau's palace again suffered.\r\nUnder the Consulate it became a barracks and a prison, and finally, not\r\nless terrible, were the restorations of Napoleon and Louis Philippe. A\r\ncastle may sometimes suffer less from a siege than from a restoration.\r\n\r\nFrom every point of view, however, Fontainebleau remains an\r\narchitectural document of the most profound interest and value, and,\r\nfrom the tourists' point of view, it is the most appealing of all\r\nEuropean palaces of this or any other age. The expert, the artist and\r\nthe mere curiosity-seeker all unite in their admiration in spite of the\r\nfact that the fabric has been denuded of many of its original beauties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Palais de Fontainebleau_]\r\n\r\nFirst, this royal dwelling is of the most ample and effective\r\nproportions; second, it possesses a remarkable series of luxurious\r\napartments; third, it still contains some of the finest examples of\r\nfurniture and furnishings of Renaissance and Napoleonic times; and, in\r\naddition, there is also to be seen that admirable series of paintings\r\nwhich represent the School of Fontainebleau. With such an array of\r\ncharms what does it matter if the unity of the Renaissance masterpiece\r\nof Francois I is qualified by later interpolations? General impression\r\nis the standard by which one judges the workmanship of a noble monument,\r\nand here it is good to an extraordinary degree.\r\n\r\nThe palace of to-day sits at one end of the aristocratic little town of\r\nFontainebleau. Beyond is the forest and opposite are many hotels which\r\ndepend upon the palace as the source from which they draw their\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\nThe principal entrance to the palace opens out from the Place Solferino\r\nand gives access immediately to the Cour du Cheval Blanc of Chambiges,\r\nwhich, since that eventful day in Napoleonic history nearly a hundred\r\nyears ago, has become better known as the Cour des Adieux. At the rear\r\nrises the famous horseshoe stair, certainly much better expressed in\r\nFrench as the _Escalier en Fer a Cheval_, from which the emperor took\r\nhis farewell of his \"Vieux Grognards\" lined up before him, biting\r\nsavagely at their moustaches to keep down their emotions.\r\n\r\nThis Cour du Cheval Blanc acquired its name from a plaster cast of\r\nMarcus Aurelius's celebrated steed which was originally placed here\r\nunder a canopy or baldaquin held aloft by colonnettes. The moulds for\r\nthis work were brought from Venice by Primaticcio and Vignole, but it\r\nwas never cast in bronze and the statue itself disappeared in 1626. The\r\ncourtyard, however, still kept the name until the last of Napoleonic\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAs a Napoleonic memory this Cour des Adieux shares popularity with the\r\nfamous Cabinet of the Empire suite of apartments where Napoleon signed\r\nhis abdication. Certainly most visitors will carry away the memory of\r\nthese words as among the most vivid souvenirs of Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\n     \"_Le 5 Avril, 1814, Napoleon Bonaparte signa son abdication sur\r\n     cette table dans le cabinet de travail du Roi, le deuxieme apres la\r\n     chambre a coucher a Fontainebleau._\"\r\n\r\nThe abdication itself (the document) is now exposed in the Galerie de\r\nDiane, transformed lately into the Library.\r\n\r\nOn the right is the Aile Neuf, built by Louis XV, for the housing of his\r\nofficers, on the site of the Galerie de Ulysse, originally one of the\r\nmost notable features of the palace of Francois I. Opposite is the sober\r\nalignment of the Aile des Ministres, and still farther to the rear are\r\nthe Pavillon des Aumoniers, or de l'Horloge; the Chapelle de la Trinite;\r\nthe Pavillon des Armes; the Pavillon des Peintres; the Pavillon des\r\nPoels; the Galerie des Fresques; and, finally, the Pavillon des\r\nReines-Meres. All of these details are of the period of Francois I save\r\nthe last, which was an interpolation of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThe Fer a Cheval stairway, however, most curious because of the\r\ndifficulties of its construction, dates from the time of Louis XIII, and\r\nreplaces the stairs built by Philibert Delorme. The tennis court, just\r\nbefore the Pavillon de l'Horloge, dates only from Louis XV.\r\n\r\nThe imposing entrance court is a hundred and twelve metres in width by a\r\nhundred and fifty-two metres in length, and to see it as it was\r\noriginally, before the destruction of the Galerie d'Ulysse, one must\r\nimagine it as closed in by a series of small pavilions with their\r\nfrontons of colonnettes preceded only by a staircase and two drawbridges\r\ncrossing the moat, which at that time surrounded the entire confines of\r\nthe palace. The moat is to-day surrounded, where it still exists, by a\r\nbalustrade, due to the rather shabby taste of Louis XV.\r\n\r\nAn inner courtyard, known as the Cour de la Fontaine, is incomparably of\r\nfiner general design than the entrance court, and the Cour Ovale,\r\nabsolutely as Henri IV left it, is finer still. At the foot of this\r\nlatter court is the Baptistry where were baptised, in 1606, the three\r\n\"Enfants de France,\" the dauphin, afterwards Louis XIII; the Princesse\r\nElizabeth, afterwards the Queen of Spain; and the Princesse de Savoie.\r\n\r\nThe Cour Ovale is practically of the proportions of the ancient Manor of\r\nFontaine Belle Eau, built by Robert le Pieux. There, too, Philippe\r\nAuguste, Saint Louis, Philippe-le-Bel, Charles V and Charles VII\r\nfrequently resided. Francois I had no wish that this old manor should\r\nentirely disappear and preserved its old donjon, a relic which has since\r\ngone the way of many another noble fane. There are several other notable\r\ncourts or gardens, the Cour des Offices, the Jardin de Diane, the\r\nOrangerie, the Cour des Princes, etc.\r\n\r\nAll the original gardens were laid out anew by Louis XIV, and that of\r\nDiane underwent a considerable change at the hands of Napoleon, who also\r\nlaid out a Jardin Anglais on the site of the ancient Jardin des Pins,\r\nwhere originally sprang into being the rippling Fontaine Beleau, or\r\nBelle Eau, which gave its name to the palace, the forest and the town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Salle du Throne, Fontainebleau_]\r\n\r\nThe park, as distinct from the great expanse of surrounding forest, is a\r\nfinely shaded range of alleys, due chiefly to Henri IV, who cut the\r\ngreat canal of ornamental water and ordained the general arrangement of\r\nits details.\r\n\r\nThe principal curiosity of the park is the famous Treille du Roy, or the\r\nKing's Grape Vine, which, good seasons and bad, can be counted on to\r\ngive three thousand kilos of authentic _chasselas_, grapes of the finest\r\nquality. One wonders who gets them: _Ou s'en vont les raisins du roi?_\r\nThis is an interrogation that has been raised more than once in the\r\nFrench parliament.\r\n\r\nIn general, the aspect of the exterior of the Palais de Fontainebleau,\r\nthe walls themselves, the Cours, the alleyed walks are chiefly\r\nreminiscent of the early art of the Renaissance. Francois I is, after\r\nall, more in evidence than the Henris or the Napoleons. Within, the same\r\nis true in general, though to a less degree. The Renaissance is\r\n_maitresse_ within and without; the other moods are wholly subservient\r\nto her grace.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly an apartment in all the world of palaces in France, or\r\nbeyond the frontiers, to rank with the great Galerie Francois I at\r\nFontainebleau, though indeed its proportions are modest and its lighting\r\ndefective to-day, for Louis XV blocked up all the windows on one side.\r\nIt remains, however, one of the richest examples of the Franco-Italian\r\ndecoration of its era, though somewhat tarnished by the heedlessness of\r\nCharles X.\r\n\r\nNever were there before, nor since, its era such mythological\r\nwall-paintings as are here to be seen. The aspirants for the Prix de\r\nRome protest each year against such subjects being set them for their\r\n_concours_, but their judges, recalling how effective such examples are,\r\nare insistent. The best examples of the School of Fontainebleau are a\r\ndistinct variety of French painting. The veriest dabbler in art can say\r\nwith Michelet: \"There is no reminiscence of anything Italian therein.\"\r\n\r\nFrankly, these works were the product of secondary artists and their\r\npupils. Leonardo da Vinci, too old to do anything more than direct, saw\r\nhimself succeeded by Del Sarto, Rosso and Primaticcio. Cellini may have\r\ncontributed, too, but his labours were doubtless blotted out to a great\r\nextent by the orders of the all-powerful Duchesse d'Etampes who feared\r\nhis competition with her protege, Primaticcio. One of the masters of\r\nthis coterie was Nicolo dell' Abbate, better known, perhaps, for his\r\nworks painted at Bologna than for his frescoes at Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Galerie Henri II is notable also for its decorations, the harmonious\r\njuxtaposition of sculpture and painting, and, although \"restored\" in\r\nlate years, presents an astonishing pristine vigour. This apartment\r\nranks with the Galerie Francois I, all things considered, as one of the\r\nchief show apartments of the palace. Its length is thirty metres, its\r\nbreadth ten, with five ample round-headed windows letting in a flood of\r\nlight on either side, one set giving on the Cour Ovale, and the other on\r\nthe Parterre and the magnificent facade of the Porte Doree. The ceiling\r\nis broken up into octagonal _caissons_, their depths alternately laid\r\nwith gold or silver, bearing the monogram of the monarch and his\r\n_devise_. The parquet is laid in divisions reproducing the design of the\r\nceiling. On either side the walls are wainscoted in oak similarly\r\nemblazoned in gold and silver, with the initials of Diane de Poitiers,\r\nand of her admirer, Henri, everywhere interlaced. Again, a colossal\r\nmonogram reproduces itself in the chimney-piece with the frescoes of\r\nNicolo dell' Abbate, and fifty figures of mythological gods and heroes\r\ndecorate the window casings.\r\n\r\nThe chapel dates chiefly from the time of Henri IV, the altar and\r\nnumerous embellishments belonging to later reigns.\r\n\r\nA certain sentiment, not a little real beauty, and much unauthenticated\r\nhistory attach themselves to the Salon Louis XIII, the Salle du Trone,\r\nthe Apartment of Madame de Maintenon, those of Napoleon I, of Pope Pius\r\nVII and of Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\nThe Galerie de Diane is little reminiscent of the day of the huntress,\r\nbeing a reconstitution under the First Empire, though its decorations\r\ndate from the Restoration, and the ceiling, and furniture, apparently of\r\nthe best of Renaissance times, are merely copies made by Louis Philippe,\r\nwho did not hesitate, on another occasion, to blue-wash the Salon de\r\nSaint Louis, and who hung worthless third-rate paintings, which even\r\nprovincial museums of the meanest rank have since refused to house, in\r\nthe admirably decorated apartments of the period of Francois and Henri.\r\n\r\nFontainebleau, to-day, is but a memory of what it was, a memory by no\r\nmeans fragmentary, by no means complete; but all sufficient.\r\n\r\nOf later years there is actually little to single out in the way of\r\nremarkable additions or restorations. Under the Second Empire the\r\nGalerie Francois I was repainted, some false antiquities added as\r\nfurnishings, and various ranges of books were stored away in the Galerie\r\nde Diane, having been brought from the chapel which had ceased to serve\r\nas the Library. This apartment was now refitted as a chapel, and, to\r\nsupplant six wall paintings which had been removed, Napoleon III ordered\r\nseven canvases from the painter Schopin, illustrating the life of Saint\r\nSaturnin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFinally, the Salle de Spectacle completes the modern additions, and,\r\nwhile gaudily striking, is scarcely above the taste of a gilded cafe in\r\nsome pompous Prefecture.\r\n\r\nHenri IV was the creator of the park of the palace, which extended as\r\nfar as the village of Avon and absorbed all the Seigneurie de Montceau,\r\nof which Mi-Voie (the dairy of Catherine de Medici) occupied a part. The\r\nacquisition of the Seigneurie was made in 1609. Across it was cut a\r\n\"grand canal\" in imitation of that already possessed by the Chateau de\r\nFleury. It was a great rarity as a garden accessory, and was more than a\r\nquarter of a league long and forty metres wide. Bassompierre said in his\r\nmemoirs that Henri IV made him a wager that it could be filled with\r\nwater in two days. It actually took eight.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the park, Henri IV built, under the name of La\r\nMenagerie, what he called a _maison de plaisance_, but which was really\r\nthe forerunner of the animal house at Versailles.\r\n\r\nTo all these works of Henri IV in the gardens at Fontainebleau is\r\nattached the name of Francine. There were two brothers of the name,\r\nThomas and Alexandre, and it was the latter who chiefly occupied himself\r\nwith the Parterre, the Chaussee and the Grand Canal at Fontainebleau. In\r\nthe Jardin de la Reine he erected the celebrated Fontaine de Diane which\r\nfinally gave its name to the garden itself. The fountain was designed by\r\nBarthelemy Prieur, and was cast in 1603. The original bronzes are now in\r\nthe Louvre, those seen at Fontainebleau to-day being later works (1684).\r\n\r\nThe Forest of Fontainebleau is a dozen leagues in circumference, and of\r\nan area of nearly thirty-five thousand acres. Its beauty, its natural\r\nbeauty, is unrivalled. Rocks, ravines, valleys, patriarchal oaks and\r\nbeeches, plains, woods, glades, meadows, lawns and cliffs, all are here.\r\nIts population of stag and deer was practically exterminated during the\r\nRevolution of 1830, but nevertheless it sustained its reputation as a\r\ngreat hunting-ground for long afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Hunt invariably centered at La Croix du Grand Veneur, a\r\nnotable landmark of the forest even now, at the intersection of four\r\nmagnificent forest roads. Its name comes from a legend of a spectral\r\nblack huntsman who was supposed to haunt the forest, and who appeared\r\nfor the last time, in reality or imagination, to Henri IV shortly before\r\nhis assassination.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, one of the last and most gorgeous of Fontainebleau hunts was\r\ngiven by Louis Napoleon. The emperor spent lavishly for the equipment of\r\nthe hunt, and granted liberal stipends to the attendants that they might\r\ncaparison themselves with some semblance of picturesque dignity; horses\r\nand dogs were furnished and cared for on the same liberal scale.\r\n\r\nThe costuming of a hunting party under such conditions was not the least\r\nappealing of its picturesque elements. Three-cornered hats, gold lace,\r\nknee breeches, silk stockings and other costly properties, when provided\r\nfor a single special occasion, as they were in this case, were apt to\r\nsuggest the life of centuries long gone by rather than that of modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe Forest of Fontainebleau can best be briefly described as a\r\nrendezvous for tourists and \"trippers,\" and as a vast open-air studio\r\nfor the youthful emulators of \"the men of Barbison.\"\r\n\r\nHistoric, romantic and artistic memories and realities are on every\r\nhand; the march of time and progress has not dimmed them, nor thinned\r\nthem out; the Forest of Fontainebleau remains to-day the best known and\r\nmost delightful extent of wildwood in all the world.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the well-known names associated with the Forest of\r\nFontainebleau, and one which will never die, is that of Denecourt,\r\ncalled also the \"Sylvain de la Foret,\" a mythological appellation which\r\ncame from his abounding knowledge of its devious ways and byways. It was\r\nin 1841 that Denecourt began his original studies and catalogued its\r\nevery stone and tree. He invented names and gave a historical setting to\r\nmany a picturesque and romantic site which might not have been known at\r\nall had it not been for his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAfter the vogue of Denecourt all the world followed in his footsteps\r\nuntil the Parisian knew as well the Longue Rocher, the Gorges d'Apremont\r\nand the Gorge de Franchard as he did the Rue de la Paix or the Champs\r\nElysees. Denecourt's great work, \"_Promenades dans la Foret de\r\nFontainebleau_\" appeared in 1845, and if he is to be criticised for\r\nletting his fancy run away with him now and then, and for the opera\r\nbouffe nomenclature of many of the _caves_ and _mares_ and _chenes_ and\r\n\"fairy-bowers\" and \"tables of kings,\" he at least has enabled a curious\r\npublic to become better acquainted with this great forest.\r\n\r\nThe flora of the Forest of Fontainebleau is remarkably varied; Denecourt\r\ngives seventy varieties of plants and flowers which grow and propagate\r\nhere naturally, to which are to be added a great number of nondescript\r\nvines, lichens and vegetable mosses.\r\n\r\nOf the trees the list extends from the imposing and sometimes gigantic\r\noaks, elms, beeches, and willows to shrubs and heather growth of the\r\nmost humble species.\r\n\r\nA score or more of the most commonly known feathered tribes people the\r\nforest to-day with almost the same freedom of life and abundance as in\r\nmonarchial times. The songsters are all there, from the robin to the\r\nnightingale; as well as the partridge and the celebrated indigenous\r\ngrouse.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1830 the forest was well supplied with big game, deer and\r\nwild boar without number; but, in later times, as was but natural, these\r\nhave been greatly thinned out. Rabbits and hares, to say nothing of\r\nfoxes and the like, were formerly so abundant that, under Louis\r\nPhilippe, it was necessary to carry out what was practically a war of\r\nextermination. To-day they exist, of course, but in no great numbers.\r\n\r\nAnother sort of publicity has been given the Forest of Fontainebleau by\r\nits association with the painters of the thirties. Theodore Rousseau,\r\nin 1836, lived at Barbison, which at that time was but a hamlet of a few\r\nhouses, with no encumbering hotels, garages and merry-go-rounds as\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nA certain Pere Ganne kept a sort of a lodging house where artists were\r\nmade welcome at an exceedingly modest price. Not only the really famous\r\nand much exploited painters of the time gained fortunes here, but those\r\nof a more conservative school, who never rose to really great\r\ndistinction, also drew much of their inspiration from the neighbourhood,\r\namong them Hamon, Boulanger and Celestin Nanteuil.\r\n\r\nWithout having to go far to hunt up their subjects, the Forest of\r\nFontainebleau lying near Barbison offered to painters much that was not\r\navailable within so small a radius elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDiaz was here already when, in 1849, Jacque and Millet arrived upon the\r\nscene, and at more or less frequent intervals, and for more or less\r\nlengthy stays, there came Corot, Dupre and Daubigny.\r\n\r\nJust what the Barbison school produced in the way of painting all the\r\nworld knows to-day, but these men were originally the target of every\r\nprejudiced critic of the Boulevards and the Faubourgs. The present day\r\nhas brought its reward and appreciation, though it is the dealers who\r\nhave profited--the men are dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Monument to Rousseau and Millet at Barbison_]\r\n\r\nIn memory of the fame brought to this little corner of the forest in\r\ngeneral, and to Barbison in particular, there was placed (in 1894), at\r\nthe entrance to the village, a bronze medallion showing the heads of\r\nMillet and Rousseau. It was a delicate way of showing appreciation for\r\nthe talents of those two great men who actually founded a new school of\r\npainting.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the forest is the little village of Marlotte, also a\r\nhaven for many painters of a former day, and no less so for those of\r\nto-day. The old forest in three quarters of a century has seen itself\r\nreproduced on canvas in all its moods. No painter ever lived, nor could\r\nall the painters that ever lived, exhaust its infinite variety. Hebert\r\nin his \"_Dictionnaire de la Foret de Fontainebleau_\" says, rightly\r\nenough, that, with the coming of the men of Fontainebleau and its\r\n\"_artist-villages_\" the classic type of \"Paysage d'Italie\" has\r\ndisappeared from the Salon Catalogues.\r\n\r\nArt amateurs and the common people alike made the reputation of\r\nFontainebleau; the mere \"trippers\" were brought thither by Denecourt,\r\nbut the real forest lovers were those who were attracted by the\r\nmasterpieces of the painters. The town of Fontainebleau has changed\r\nsomewhat under this double influence. At Fontainebleau itself are two\r\nmonuments in memory of painters who have passed away. One of these is to\r\nthe memory of Decamps, who was killed by a fall from his horse while\r\nriding in the forest; it is a simple bust, the work of Carrier-Belleuse.\r\nThe other is of Rosa Bonheur who died at Thomery, a little village on\r\nthe southern border of the forest, in 1902; it is an almost life-size\r\nbull from a small model by the artist herself and surmounts a pedestal\r\nwhich also bears a medallion of the artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBY THE BANKS OF THE SEINE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the highroad to Saint Germain one passes innumerable historic\r\nmonuments which suggest the generous part that many minor chateaux\r\nplayed in the court life of the capital of old.\r\n\r\nTo-day, Maisons, La Muette and Bagatelle are mere names which serve the\r\ntram lines for roof signs and scarcely one in a thousand strangers gives\r\nthem a thought.\r\n\r\nThe famous Bois de Boulogne and its immediate environment have for\r\ncenturies formed a delicious verdant framing for a species of French\r\ncountry-house which could not have existed within the fortifications.\r\nThese luxurious, bijou dwellings, some of them, at least, the caprices\r\nof kings, others the property of the new nobility, and still others of\r\nmere plebeian kings of finance, are in a class quite by themselves.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most famous of these is the celebrated Bagatelle, within the\r\nconfines of the Bois itself. The Chateau de Bagatelle was built in a\r\nmonth, thus meriting its name, by the Comte d'Artois, the future\r\nCharles X, as a result of a wager with Marie Antoinette. On its facade\r\nit originally bore the inscription: \"_Parva sed apta_\"--\"small but\r\nconvenient.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBagatelle occupied a corner of the royal domain and, after its\r\ncompletion, was sold to the Marquise de Monconseil, in 1747, who gave to\r\nthis princely suburban residence a dignity worthy of its origin. Then\r\ncame La Pompadour on the scene, the _petite bourgeoise_ who, by the\r\nnobility acquired by the donning of a court costume and marriage with\r\nthe Sieur Normand d'Etioles, usurped the right to sit beside duchesses\r\nand be presented to the queen, if not as an equal, at least as the\r\n_maitresse_ of her spouse, the king.\r\n\r\nThere is a legend about a meeting between La Pompadour and the king at\r\nBagatelle, a meeting in which she established herself so firmly in the\r\ngraces of the monarch that on the morrow she formed a part of the\r\nentourage at Versailles.\r\n\r\nAfter having come into the possession of the heirs of Sir Richard\r\nWallace, Bagatelle finally became the property of the State.\r\n\r\nIt is in the Chateau de Bagatelle that is to be installed the \"Musee de\r\nla Parole\"--\"The Museum of Speech.\" The French, innovators ever, plan\r\nthat Bagatelle shall become a sort of conservatory of the human voice,\r\nand here will be classed methodically the cylinders and disks which have\r\nrecorded the spoken words of all sorts and conditions of men.\r\n\r\nIn this Musee de la Parole will be kept phonographic records of all\r\ncurrent dialects in France, the argot of the Parisian lower classes,\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nUp to the present the evolution of the speech of man has ever been an\r\nenigma. No one knows to-day how Homer or Virgil pronounced their words,\r\nand Racine and Corneille, though of a time less remote, have left no\r\ntangible record of their speech. Monsieur Got of the Comedie Francaise\r\nbelieves that Louis XIV pronounced \"_Moi_,\" \"_le Roi_\" as \"_Moue_\" \"_le\r\nRoue_\"; and thus he pronounced it in a speech which has been recorded in\r\nwax and is to form a part of the collection at Bagatelle.\r\n\r\nThe Polo Grounds of Bagatelle, between the chateau and the Seine as it\r\nswirls around the Ile de la Folie, are to-day better known than this\r\ndainty little Paris palace; but Bagatelle will some day come to its own\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNeuilly bounds the Bois de Boulogne on the north, and has little of a\r\nroyal appearance to-day, save its straight, broad streets.\r\n\r\nThere is a royal incident connected with the Pont de Neuilly which\r\nshould not be forgotten. It came about in connection with the return of\r\nHenri IV from Saint Germain in company with the queen and the Duc de\r\nVendome. They were in a great coach drawn by four horses which insisted\r\non drinking from the river in spite of the efforts of the coachman to\r\nprevent them.\r\n\r\nThe carriage was overturned and the royal party barely escaped being\r\ndrowned. One of the aids who accompanied them recounted the fact that\r\nthe impromptu bath had cured the king's toothache which he had acquired\r\nover a rather hasty meal just before leaving the palace. \"Had I\r\nwitnessed the adventure,\" said the Marquis de Verneuil, \"I should have\r\nproposed the toast: 'Le Roi Boit!\" As a result of this incident a new\r\nbridge was constructed, though it was afterwards replaced by the present\r\nstone structure over which a ceaseless traffic rushes in and out of\r\nParis to-day. It was this present bridge over which Louis XV was the\r\nfirst to pass on September 22, 1772.\r\n\r\nThe Chateau de Neuilly was a favourite suburban residence of Louis\r\nPhilippe. It was here that a delegation came to offer him the crown,\r\nand, after he had become king, he was pleased to still inhabit it and\r\nactually spent considerable sums upon its maintenance. When the\r\nRevolution of 1848 broke out, the sovereign took refuge at Neuilly and,\r\nwhen besieged by the multitude, took flight in the night of February 26\r\nand left his chateau in the hands of a band of ruffians who pillaged it\r\nfrom cellar to garret, finally setting it on fire. It burned like a pile\r\nof brushwood, and it is said that more than a hundred drunken desperados\r\nperished when its walls fell in. This was the tragic end of the Chateau\r\nde Neuilly.\r\n\r\nBy a decree of the president of the later Republic the Orleans princes\r\nwere obliged to sell all their French properties and the park of the\r\nChateau de Neuilly was cut up into morsels and lots were sold to all\r\ncomers. Thus was born that delightful Paris suburb, with the broad,\r\nshady avenues and comfortable houses, with which one is familiar to-day.\r\nThe aristocratic Parc de Neuilly, with Saint James, is the only tract\r\nnear Paris where one finds such lovely gardens and such fresh, shady\r\navenues.\r\n\r\nAnother quarter of Neuilly possesses a history worthy of being\r\nrecounted. The district known as Saint James derived its name from a\r\ngreat suburban property which in 1775 belonged to Baudart de Saint\r\nJames. He created a property almost royal in its appointments, its\r\ngardens having acquired an extraordinary renown. When he became a\r\nbankrupt a throng of persons visited the property not so much with a\r\nview to purchase as out of curiosity. A writer of the time says of this\r\nLucullus that he was the envy of all Paris. He died soon after his ruin,\r\nfrom chagrin, and in apparent poverty, which seemingly established his\r\ngood faith with his creditors. Under the First Empire the domain was\r\nbought by, or for, the Princesse Borghese, who here gave many brilliant\r\nfetes at which the emperor himself frequently assisted. On the occasion\r\nof the marriage of Napoleon to Marie Louise a series of fetes took place\r\nhere which evoked the especially expressed encomiums of the emperor.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 Wellington made it his headquarters and here had his first\r\nconference with Blucher. Upon Wellington quitting Saint James the\r\nproperty was pillaged by the Iron Duke's own troops and actually\r\ndemolished by the picks and axes of the soldiery.\r\n\r\nNear the Passy entrance of the Bois is La Muette, a relic of a royal\r\nhunting-lodge which took its name from the royal pack of hounds\r\n(_meute_) which was formerly kept here.\r\n\r\nThe Chateau de la Muette was the caprice of Francois I, who, when he\r\ncame to Paris, wished to have his pleasures near at hand, and, being the\r\nchief partisan of the hunt among French monarchs, built La Muette for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Chateau de la Muette is thus classed as one of the royal dwellings\r\nof France though hardly ever is it mentioned in the annals of to-day.\r\n\r\nRebuilt by Charles IX, from his father's more modest shooting box, La\r\nMuette became the centre of the court of Marguerite de Navarre, the\r\nfirst wife of Henri IV; after which it served as the habitation of the\r\ndauphin, who became Louis XIII.\r\n\r\nDuring the regency, Philippe d'Orleans took possession of the chateau\r\nuntil the enthronement of Louis XV. The latter here established a little\r\ncourt within a court, best described by the French as: \"_ses plaisirs\r\nprives_.\" It was this monarch who rebuilt, or at least restored, the\r\nchateau, and brought it to the state in which one sees it to-day.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and the court took up a brief\r\nresidence here to assist at the aerostatic experiences of De Rosier, and\r\nin 1787, ceasing to be a royal residence, La Muette was offered for sale\r\nafter first having been stripped of its precious wainscotings, its\r\nmarbles and the artistic curiosities of all sorts with which it had been\r\ndecorated. The chateau itself now became the property of Sebastian\r\nErard, who bought it for the modest price of two hundred and sixty\r\nthousand francs.\r\n\r\nSomewhat farther from Paris, crossing the peninsula formed by the first\r\nof the great bends of the Seine below the capital, is Chatou which has a\r\nroyal reminder in its Pavilion Henri IV, or Pavillon Gabrielle, which\r\nthe gallant, love-making monarch built for Gabrielle d'Estrees. Formerly\r\nit was surrounded by a vast park and must have been almost ideal, but\r\nto-day it is surrounded by stucco, doll-house villas, and unappealing\r\napartments, until only a Gothic portal, jutting from a row of dull house\r\nfronts, suggests the once cosy little retreat of the lovely Gabrielle.\r\n\r\nThe height of Louveciennes, above Bougival, closes the neck of the\r\npeninsula and from it a vast panorama of the silvery Seine and its\r\n_coteaux_ stretches out from the towers of Notre Dame on one hand to the\r\ndense forest of Saint Germain on the other.\r\n\r\nThe original Chateau de Louveciennes was the property of Madame la\r\nPrincesse de Conti, but popular interest lies entirely with the Pavilion\r\ndu Barry, built by the architect Ledoux under the orders of Louis XV.\r\n\r\nDu Barry, having received the chateau as a gift from the king, sought to\r\ndecorate it and reembellish it anew. Through the ministrations of a\r\ncertain Drouais, Fragonard was commissioned to decorate a special\r\npavilion outside the chateau proper, destined for the \"_collations du\r\nRoi_.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject chosen was the \"Progres de l'Amour dans le Coeur des\r\nJeunes Filles.\" Just where these panels are to-day no one seems to know,\r\nbut sooner or later they will doubtless be discovered.\r\n\r\nFragonard's famous \"Escalade,\" or \"Rendezvous,\" the first of the series\r\nof five proposed panels, depicted the passion of Louis XV for du Barry.\r\nThe shepherdess had the form and features of that none too scrupulous\r\nfeminine beauty, and the \"_berger gallant_\" was manifestly a portrait of\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\nPerhaps these decorations at Louveciennes were elaborations of these\r\nsmaller canvases. It seems quite probable.\r\n\r\nSheltered snugly against the banked-up Forest of Saint Germain, on the\r\nbanks of the Seine, is Maisons-Laffitte. Maisons is scarcely ever\r\nmentioned by Parisians save as they comment on the sporting columns of\r\nthe newspapers, for horse-racing now gives its distinction to the\r\nneighbourhood, and the old Chateau de Maisons (with its later suffix of\r\nLaffitte) is all but forgotten.\r\n\r\nFrancois Mansart built the first Chateau de Maisons on a magnificent\r\nscale for Rene de Longueil, the Superintendent of Finance. In a later\r\ncentury it made a most effectual appeal to another financier, Laffitte,\r\nthe banker, who parcelled out the park and stripped the chateau.\r\n\r\nFor a century, though, the chateau belonged to the family of its\r\nfounder, and in 1658 the surrounding lands were made into a Marquisate.\r\nIn 1671, on the day of the death of Philippe, Duc d'Anjou, Maisons may\r\nbe said to have become royal for the court there took up its residence.\r\nLater, the Marquis de Soyecourt became the owner and Voltaire stayed\r\nhere for a time; in fact he nearly died here from an attack of smallpox.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 the property was acquired by the Comte d'Artois and the royal\r\nfamily of the time were frequent guests. The king, the queen and each\r\nof the princes all had their special apartments, and if Louis XVI had\r\nnot been too busy with other projects, more ambitious ones, there is\r\nlittle doubt but that he would have given Maisons an eclat which during\r\nall of its career it had just missed. At the Revolution it was sold as\r\nNational Property and the proceeds turned into public coffers.\r\n\r\nWith the Empire the chateau became more royalist than ever. Marechal\r\nLannes became its proprietor, then the Marechal de Montebello, who here\r\nreceived Napoleon on many occasions. With the invasion of 1815 the\r\nvillage was devastated, but the chateau escaped, owing to its having\r\nbeen made the headquarters of the invading allies. After this, in 1818,\r\nthe banker Laffitte came into possession. He exercised a great\r\nhospitality and lived the life of an opulent bourgeois, but he destroyed\r\nmost of the outbuildings and the stables built by Mansart, and cut up\r\nthe great expanse of park which originally consisted of five hundred\r\nhectares. His ideas were purely commercial, not the least esthetic.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of decoration within, as without, is distinctly unique. Doric\r\npilasters and columns support massive cornices and round-cornered\r\nceilings, with here and there antique motives and even Napoleonic\r\neagles as decorative features. To-day all the apartments are deserted\r\nand sad. The finest, from all points of view, is that of the\r\nSalle-a-Manger, though indeed some of the motives are but plaster\r\nreproductions of the originals. The chimney-piece, however, is left, a\r\npure bijou, a model of grace, more like a pagan altar than a\r\ncomparatively modern mantel. The oratory is in the pure style of the\r\nEmpire, and the stairway, lighted up by a curiously arranged\r\ndome-lantern, gives a most startling effect to the entrance vestibule.\r\n\r\nIn general the design of Maisons is gracious, not at all outre, though\r\nundeniably grandiose; too much so for a structure covering so small an\r\narea. The Cour d'Honneur gives it its chief exterior distinction and the\r\ntwo pavilions have a certain grace of charm, when considered separately,\r\nwhich the ensemble somewhat lacks. The surroundings, had they not been\r\nruthlessly cut up into building lots for over-ambitious Paris\r\nshopkeepers, would have added greatly to the present appearance of the\r\nproperty. As it is, the near-by race-course absorbed the orchard, the\r\n_pelouse_ and many of the garden plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMALMAISON AND MARLY\r\n\r\n\r\nOut from Paris, by the cobbly Pave du Roi, which a parental\r\nadministration is only just now digging up and burying under, just\r\nbeyond the little suburban townlet of Rueil (where the Empress Josephine\r\nand her daughter Hortense lie buried in the parish church), one comes to\r\nMalmaison of unhappy memory. It is not imposing, palatial, nor,\r\narchitecturally, very worthy, but it is one of the most sentimentally\r\nhistoric of all French monuments of its class.\r\n\r\nSince no very definite outlines remain of any royal historical monument\r\nat Rueil to-day the tourist bound towards Versailles by train, tram or\r\nroad, gives little thought to the snug little suburb through which he\r\nshuffles along, hoping every minute to leave the noise, bustle and\r\ncobblestones of Paris behind.\r\n\r\nRueil is deserving of more consideration than this. According to Gregory\r\nof Tours the first race of kings had a \"pleasure house\" here, and called\r\nthe neighbourhood Rotolajum. Not always did these old kings stay cooped\r\nup in a fortress in the Isle of Lutetia. Sometimes they went afield for\r\na day in the country like the rest of us, and to them, with their slow\r\nmeans of communication and the bad roads of their day, Rueil, scarce a\r\ndozen miles from Notre Dame, seemed far away.\r\n\r\nChilderbert I, son of Clovis, is mentioned as having made a protracted\r\nsojourn at Rueil, and whatever may have existed then in the way of a\r\nroyal residence soon after passed to the monks of Saint Denis, who here\r\nfished and hunted and lived a life of comfort and ease such as they\r\ncould hardly do in their fortress-abbey. They, too, required change and\r\nrest from time to time, and, apparently, when they could, took it.\r\n\r\nThe Black Prince burned the town and all its dependencies in 1346, and\r\nonly an unimportant village existed when Richelieu thought to build a\r\ncountry-house here on this same charming site which had so pleased the\r\nfirst French monarchs. Richelieu did his work well, as always, and built\r\nan immense chateau, surrounded by a deep moat into which were turned the\r\nswift-flowing waters of the Seine. A vast park was laid out, in part in\r\nthe formal manner and in part as a natural preserve, and the\r\nneighbourhood once more became frequented by royalty and the nobles of\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nRichelieu bequeathed the property to his niece, the Duchesse\r\nd'Aiguillon, and Louis XIV became a frequent dweller there--as a\r\nvisitor, but he did not mind that. Louis XIV was sometimes a monarch,\r\nsometimes a master, and sometimes a \"family friend,\" to put it in a\r\nnoncommittal manner.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution nearly made way with the property and the Duc de Massena,\r\na few years afterwards, reestablished it after a fashion, but\r\nspeculating land-boomers came along in turn and royal memories meaning\r\nnothing to them the property was cut up into streets, avenues and house\r\nlots.\r\n\r\nThe Chateau de Malmaison, which is very near Rueil, is in quite a\r\ndifferent class. Its history comes very nearly down to modern times. The\r\nmemory of Malmaison is purely Napoleonic. Its historical souvenirs are\r\nmany, but its actual ruins have taken on a plebeian aspect of little\r\nappeal in these later days.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 Malmaison was sold as a piece of national merchandise to be\r\nturned into _ecus_, and a certain Monsieur Lecouteux de Canteleu, having\r\nthe ready cash and a disposition to live under its roof, took over the\r\nproprietorship for a time. It was he who sold it to Josephine\r\nBeauharnais, and it was she who gave it a glory and splendour which it\r\nhad never before possessed, gave it its complete fame, in fact.\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself, as First Consul, was passionately fond of the place,\r\nbut by the time he had become emperor, because of unhappy memories,\r\nperhaps, for he had them at times, came rarely to this charming suburban\r\nchateau.\r\n\r\nIt was at Malmaison that began the good fortune of Josephine, and it was\r\nat Malmaison that it flickered out like the dying flame of a candle.\r\n\r\nIn a beating rain, on Saturday, December 16, 1809, Josephine quitted the\r\nTuileries, her eyes still red with the tears from that last brief\r\ninterview. She arrived at Malmaison at the end of a lugubrious day, when\r\nthe whole place was enveloped in a thick fog. She passed the night\r\nalmost alone in this great house where she had previously been so happy.\r\nShe could hardly, however, have been more sad than Napoleon was that\r\nsame night. He had shut himself up in his cabinet, remorseful and alone.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday following was hardly less melancholy, for it was then\r\nJosephine learned that Malmaison had been endowed with an income of two\r\nmillions for its upkeep, and that her personal belongings and the\r\nfurnishings of her favourite apartments were already on the way thither\r\nfrom the Tuileries. The wound was not even then allowed to heal, for\r\nshe learned that Napoleon had ordained that she was to receive the\r\nvisits of the court as if she were still empress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chateau de Malmaison_]\r\n\r\nNapoleon had already written his former spouse to the effect that he\r\nwould give much to see her, but that he did not feel sufficiently sure\r\nof himself to permit of it. This historic letter closed thus; \"_Adieu,\r\nJosephine, bonne nuit, si tu doutais de moi, tout sera bien indigne_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of December Napoleon actually did come to Malmaison to see\r\nher from whom he was officially separated. Josephine had confided to\r\nMadame de Remusat, her lady-in-waiting, \"It almost seems as if I were\r\ndead, and only possessed of the faculty of remembering the past.\"\r\n\r\nIn this Malmaison, so full of souvenirs of other days, Josephine was\r\nobliged to content herself, for on January 12, 1810, the religious\r\nmarriage of Josephine and Napoleon was annulled automatically because,\r\nas was claimed, it had not been celebrated with the necessary\r\nformalities.\r\n\r\nHere at Malmaison Josephine even surrounded herself with the most\r\nintimate souvenirs of Napoleon: a lounging chair that he was wont to\r\noccupy stood in its accustomed place; his bed was always made; his sword\r\nhung upon the wall; his pen was in his inkwell; a book was open on his\r\ndesk and his geographical globe--his famous _mappemond_--was in its\r\naccustomed place.\r\n\r\nPrinces passing through Paris came to Malmaison to salute the former\r\nempress, and she allowed herself to become absorbed in her greenhouses\r\nand her dairy, the direction of her house, her receptions and her\r\n_petite cour_.\r\n\r\nIn time all came to an end. When Napoleon returned to Paris in 1815 he\r\ninterrogated the doctor who had cared for Josephine during the illness\r\nwhich terminated in her death the year before and asked him: \"Did she\r\nspeak of me at the last?\" The doctor replied: \"Often, very often.\" With\r\nemotion Napoleon replied simply: \"_Bonne femme: bonne Josephine elle\r\nm'aimeit vraiment_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Waterloo Napoleon himself retired to Malmaison, which had become\r\nthe property of Josephine's children, Eugene and Hortense, and closed\r\nhimself up in the room where she died, the library which he occupied\r\nwhen triumphant First Consul.\r\n\r\nHere he lived five mortal days of anguish preceding his departure for\r\nRochefort on that agonizing exile from which he never returned.\r\n\r\nAfter the divorce Josephine preserved the property as her own particular\r\nresidence, and in 1814 received there the celebrated visit of the\r\nallied sovereigns. History tells of a certain boat ride which she took\r\non a neighbouring lake in company with the Emperor Alexander which is\r\nfraught with much historic sentiment. It was this imprudent excursion,\r\nin the cool of a May evening, that caused the death of the former\r\nempress three days later. It was from this bijou of a once royal abode\r\nthat Napoleon launched his famous proclamation to the army which the\r\narrogant Fouche refused to have printed in the \"_Moniteur Officiel_.\"\r\nUpon this Napoleon sent the Duc de Rovigo to Paris for his passports and\r\nthe necessary orders which would enable him to depart in peace. The next\r\nmoment he had changed his mind, and he changed it again a few moments\r\nafterwards. As the result of the Prussians' advance on Paris by the left\r\nbank of the Seine Napoleon was obliged to accept the inevitable, and\r\nwith the words of General Becker ringing in his ears: \"_Sire, tout est\r\npret_,\" he crossed the vestibule and entered the gardens amid a painful\r\ncalm on his part, and an audible weeping by his former fellows in arms\r\nwho were lined up to do him honour. He embraced Hortense passionately,\r\nand saluted all the personages of his party with a sympathy and emotion\r\nunbelievable. With an eternal adieu and a rapid step down the garden\r\nwalk to the driveway, he at last entered the carriage which was\r\nawaiting him and was driven rapidly away. Some days after the Allies\r\npillaged and sacked Malmaison. Its chief glory may be said to have\r\ndeparted with the Corsican.\r\n\r\nUnder the Restoration, Prince Eugene had a sort of \"rag sale\" of what\r\nwas left. The lands which Josephine had bought of Lecouteaux were sold\r\nto the highest bidder and the exotic shrubs and plants to any who would\r\nbuy, the pictures to such connoisseurs as had the price, those that were\r\nleft being sent to Munich. A Swedish banker now came on the scene (1826)\r\nand bought the property--the chateau and the park--which he preserved\r\nuntil his death twenty years later. Then it went to Queen Christina, and\r\nwas ultimately purchased by Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1870, during the siege of Paris, General Ducrot sought to\r\nmake a reconnaissance by way of Malmaison, and so weak was his project\r\nthat the equipages of the King of Prussia and his Etat Major invested\r\nthe environs and made the property their official headquarters.\r\n\r\nNear by is a fine property called \"Les Bruyeres,\" a royal estate of\r\nNapoleon III. It was created and developed by the emperor and was always\r\nreferred to as a Parc Imperial.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most banal of all the royal souvenirs around Paris is that\r\ngigantic mill-wheel known as the Machine de Marly, down by the Seine a\r\nfew miles beyond Malmaison, just where that awful cobblestoned roadway\r\nbegins to climb up to the plateau on which sits the chateau of Saint\r\nGermain and its park.\r\n\r\nBecause it is of unesthetic aspect is no reason for ignoring the famous\r\nMachine de Marly, the great water-hoisting apparatus first established\r\nin the reign of Louis XIV to carry the waters of the Seine to the ponds\r\nand fountains of Versailles.\r\n\r\nIt was a creation of a Liegois, named Rennequin Sualem, who knew not how\r\nto read or write, but who had a very clear idea of what was wanted to\r\nperform the work which Louis XIV demanded. For a fact the expense of the\r\nerection of the \"Machine,\" and the cost of keeping its great wheels\r\nturning, were so great that it is doubtful if it was ever a paying\r\nproposition, but that was not a _sine qua non_ so far as the king's\r\ncommand was concerned. It had cost millions of _livres_ before its\r\nwheels first turned in 1682, and, if the carpenter Brunet had not come\r\nto the rescue to considerably augment the volume of water raised (by\r\nmeans of compressed air), it is doubtful if there would ever have been\r\nenough water for the fountains of Versailles to play even one day a\r\nyear, as they do now every happy Sunday, to the delight of the\r\nmiddle-class Parisian and the droves of Cookites who gaze on them with\r\nwonder-opened eyes.\r\n\r\nThe water was led from the Machine de Marly to Versailles by a conduit\r\nof thirty-six arches where, upon reaching a higher level than the\r\ngardens, it flowed by gravity to the fountains and basins below. This\r\naqueduct was six hundred and forty-three metres long, and twenty-three\r\nmetres high. It was a work which would have done credit to the Romans.\r\n\r\nA far greater romantic sentiment attaches itself to the royal chateau of\r\nMarly-le-Roi than to the utilitarian \"Machine,\" by which the suburb is\r\nbest known to-day.\r\n\r\nThe history of Marly-le-Roi appears from the chronicles the most\r\ncomplicated to unravel of that of any of the kingly suburbs of old\r\nParis, though in the days of the old locomotion a townlet twenty-six\r\nkilometres from the capital was hardly to be thought of as a suburb.\r\n\r\nMarly-le-Roi, at any rate, with Marly-le-Bourg and Marly-le-Chatel, was\r\na royal dwelling from the days of Thierry III (678). The neighbouring\r\nregion had been made into a countship by the early seventeenth\r\ncentury, and Louis XIV acquired it as his right in exchange for\r\nNeuphle-le-Chateau in 1693, incorporating it into the domain of\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\nBy this time it had become known as Marly-le-Roi, in distinction to the\r\nother bourgs, and the king built a chateau-royal, variously known as the\r\nPalais and the Ermitage. For a fact it was neither one thing nor the\r\nother, according to accepted definition, but rather a group of a dozen\r\ndependent pavilions distributed around a central edifice, the whole\r\nstraggling off into infinite and manifestly unlovely proportions. It was\r\nas the sun surrounded by the zodiac.\r\n\r\nIsolated on a monticule by the river bank the chateau overlooked its\r\nbrood of small pavilions, which in a way formed an _entresol_, or foyer,\r\nleading to the Pavilion Royal. All were connected by iron trellises, _en\r\nberceau_, and the effect must have been exceedingly bizarre; certainly\r\ntheatrical.\r\n\r\nThe four faces of these pavilions were frescoed, and balustrades and\r\nvases at the corners were the chief architectural decorations.\r\n\r\nThe royal pavilion consisted within of four vestibules on the ground\r\nfloor, each leading to a grand apartment in the centre. In each of the\r\nfour angles was a \"self-contained\" apartment of three or four rooms.\r\nWhat this royal abode lacked in beauty it made up for in convenience.\r\n\r\nEach of the satellite pavilions was occupied by a high personage at\r\ncourt. The Chapel and the Corps de Garde were detached from the chateau\r\nproper, and occupied two flanking wings.\r\n\r\nThe plans of the \"Palais-Chateau-Ermitage\" of Marly-le-Roi were from the\r\nfertile brain of Mansart, and were arranged with considerable ingenuity,\r\nif not taste, generously interspersed with lindens and truly magnificent\r\ngarden plots. There was even a cascade, or rather a tumbling river\r\n(according to the French expression), for it fell softly over\r\nsixty-three marble steps, forming a sort of wrinkled sheet of water,\r\nwhich must indeed have been a very charming feature. It cost a hundred\r\nthousand _ecus_ to merely lead the water up to it. The expenses of the\r\nPavilion de Marly, in the ten years from 1680 to 1690, amounted to\r\n4501279 _livres_, 12 _sols_, 3 _deniers_. From this one may well judge\r\nthat it was no mean thing.\r\n\r\nThe honour of being accounted a person of Marly in those times was\r\naccredited as a great distinction, for it went without saying in that\r\ncase one had something to do with affairs of court, though one might\r\nonly have been a \"furnisher.\" To be a courtier of Louis XIV, or to be a\r\n_pensionnaire_ at Versailles, could hardly have carried more\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nThe court usually resided at Marly from Wednesday until Saturday, and as\r\n\"the game\" was the thing it is obvious that the stakes were high.\r\n\r\nThe vogue of the day was gaming at table, and Marly, of all other\r\nsuburban Paris palaces, was an ideal and discreet place for it. \"High\r\nplay and midnight suppers were the rule at Marly.\" This, one reads in\r\nthe court chronicle, and further that: \"The royal family usually lost a\r\nhundred thousand _ecus_ at play at each visit.\" One \"gentleman croupier\"\r\ngained as much as three thousand _louis_ at a single sitting.\r\n\r\nMadame de Maintenon was the real ruler of Marly in those days; she had\r\nappropriated the apartments originally intended for the queen, from\r\nwhich there was a private means of communication to the apartments of\r\nthe king, and another forming a sort of private box, overlooking the\r\nroyal chapel.\r\n\r\nLittle frequented by Louis XV, and practically abandoned by Louis XVI,\r\nthe palace at Marly was sold during the Revolution, after which it was\r\nstripped of its art treasures, many of which adorn the gardens of the\r\nTuileries to-day; the great group of horses at the entrance to the\r\nChamps Elysees came from the watering place of Marly.\r\n\r\nActually, the royal pavilion at Marly has been destroyed, and there\r\nremain but the most fragmentary, unformed heaps of stones to tell the\r\ntale of its ample proportions in the days of Louis XIV and de Maintenon.\r\n\r\nThe park is to-day the chief attraction of the neighbourhood, like the\r\none at Saint Cloud, which it greatly resembles. Across the park lies the\r\ngreat highway from the capital to Versailles, over which so many joyous\r\ncavalcades were wont to amble or gallop in the days of gallantry. The\r\npace is not more sober to-day, but gaily caparisoned horses and gaudy\r\ncoaches have given way to red and yellow \"Rois des Belges,\" the balance\r\nlying distinctly in favour of the former mode of conveyance, so far as\r\npicturesqueness is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Foret de Marly is very picturesque, but of no great extent. Formerly\r\nit enclosed many shooting-boxes belonging to the nobles of the court, of\r\nwhich those of Montjoie and Desert de Retz were perhaps the most\r\nsplendid.\r\n\r\nOn the Versailles road was the Chateau de Clagny, a royal _maison de\r\nplaisance_, of an attractive, but trivial, aspect, though its\r\narchitecture was actually of a certain massiveness. Its gardens and the\r\ndisposition of its apartments pleased the king's fancy when he chose to\r\npass this way, which was often. He is said to have personally spent over\r\ntwo million francs on the property. It must have been of some\r\npretensions, this little heard of Chateau de Clagny, for in a single\r\nyear ten thousand _livres_ were expended on keeping the gardens. To-day\r\nit is non-existent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSAINT CLOUD AND ITS PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe historic souvenirs of Saint Cloud and its royal palace are many and\r\nvaried, though scarcely anything tangible remains to-day of the fabric\r\nso loved by Francis I and Henri II, and which was, for a fact, but a\r\nmagnificent country-house, originally belonging to the Archbishops of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nTo-day the rapid slopes of the hillsides of Saint Cloud are peopled with\r\na heterogeneous mass of villas of what the Parisian calls the \"coquette\"\r\norder, but which breathe little of the spirit of romance and gallantry\r\nof Renaissance times. Saint Cloud is simply a \"discreet\" Paris suburb,\r\nand the least said about it, its villas and their occupants to-day, the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe little village of Saint Cloud which is half-hidden in the Forest of\r\nRouvray, was sacked and burned by the English after the battle of\r\nPoitiers, and then built up anew and occupied by the French monarchs in\r\nthe reign of Charles VI. It was he who built the first _chateau de\r\nplaisance_ here in which the royal family might live near Paris and yet\r\namid a sylvan environment.\r\n\r\nAfter this came the country-house of the Archbishops of Paris that Henri\r\nII, when he tired of it, tore down and erected a villa in the\r\npseudo-Italian manner of the day, and built a fourteen-arch stone bridge\r\nacross the Seine, which was a wonder of its time.\r\n\r\nThe banker Gondi, after huddling close to royalty, turned over an\r\nestablishment which he had built to Catherine de Medici, who made use of\r\nit whenever she wished to give a country fete or garden party. By this\r\ntime the whole aspect of Saint Cloud was royal.\r\n\r\nIt was within this house that the unhappy, and equally unpopular, Henri\r\nIII was cut down by the three-bladed knife of the monk Jacques Clement.\r\nThe incident is worth recounting briefly here because of the rapidity\r\nwith which history was made by a mere fanatical knife-thrust. With the\r\ndeath of Henri III came the extinction of the House of Valois.\r\n\r\nAs the king sat in the long gallery of the palace playing at cards, on\r\nAugust 1, 1589, his cloak hanging over his shoulder, a little cap with a\r\nflower stuck in it perched over one ear, and suspended from his neck by\r\na broad blue ribbon a basketful of puppies, an astrologer by the name of\r\nOsman was introduced to amuse the royal party.\r\n\r\n\"They tell me you draw horoscopes,\" remarked the king.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I will tell yours, if you will, but the heavens are\r\nunpropitious.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Just over Meudon is a star which shines very brightly,\" continued the\r\nastrologer, \"it is that of Henri de Navarre. But look, your Majesty,\r\nanother star burns brilliantly for a moment and then disappears, mayhap\r\nit is your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"If ever a man had a voice hoarse with blood it is that astrologer,\"\r\nsaid the king. \"Away with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the Valois Henri doesn't die before the setting of another sun, I'll\r\nnever cast horoscope more,\" said the astrologer as he was hustled across\r\nthe courtyard and out into the highroad.\r\n\r\nAs he left, a man in a monk's garb begged to be admitted to the king's\r\npresence. It was Jacques Clement, the murderous monk, a wily Dominican,\r\nbent on a mission which had for its object the extinction of the Valois\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nWhile the king was reading a letter which the monk had presented the\r\nlatter stabbed him deep in the stomach.\r\n\r\nSwooning, the king had just time to cry out: \"_Ha! le mechant moine: Il\r\nm'a tue, qu'on le tue._\"\r\n\r\nThe murderer in turn was struck down forthwith and his body, thrown from\r\nthe windows of the palace, was _ecartele_ by four white horses, which is\r\nthe neat French way of saying \"drawn and quartered.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an imposing cortege which wound down from the heights of Saint\r\nCloud and followed the river bank to Saint Germain, Poissy and thence to\r\nCompiegne, conveying all that was mortal of Henri III, the least popular\r\nof all the race of Valois. Following close behind the bier were Henri IV\r\nand his suite, the favourites d'Epernon, Laschant, Dugastz and an\r\nimpressive soldiery.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Henri III, Henri de Navarre, who played a not\r\nunpicturesque part in the funeral ceremonies, installed himself in a\r\nneighbouring property known as the Maison du Tillet. Thus it is seen\r\nthat the royal stamp of the little bourg of Saint Cloud was never\r\nwanting--not until the later palace and most of the town were drenched\r\nwith kerosene and set on fire by the Prussians in 1871.\r\n\r\nThe \"Maison de Gondi\" came, by a process of acquisition, and\r\ndevelopment, in time, to be the royal palace of Saint Cloud. Its\r\noverloaded details of Italian architecture were brightened up a bit by\r\nthe surroundings planned and executed by the landscapist Le Notre and\r\nthe life of the court in its suburban retreat took on a real and genuine\r\nbrilliance which under the restraint of the gloomy walls of the Louvre\r\nand Paris streets could hardly have been.\r\n\r\nThe brightest light shining over Saint Cloud at this time was the\r\nradiance shed by the brilliant Henriette d'Angleterre. Her reign as a\r\nsocial and witty queen of the court was brief. She died at the age of\r\ntwenty-six, poisoned at the instigation of the Chevalier de Lorraine\r\nwhom she had caused to be exiled. This was the common supposition, but\r\nLouis XIV was afterwards able to prove (?) his brother innocent of the\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of the seventeenth century recount many of the fetes given\r\nat Saint Cloud by Monsieur on the occasion of his marriage to the\r\nPrincesse Palatine in 1671. One of the most notable of these was that\r\ngiven for Louis XIV, wherein the celebrated cascades--an innovation of\r\nLe Notre--were first brought to view.\r\n\r\nMansart was called in and a great gallery intended for fetes and\r\nceremonies was constructed, and Mignard was given the commission for its\r\ndecorations.\r\n\r\nMonsieur died within the walls of the palace to which he had added so\r\nmany embellishments, as also did his second wife. Three royalties dead\r\nof ambition, one might well say, for their lives were neither tranquil\r\nnor healthful. They went the pace.\r\n\r\nThe regent journeyed out from Paris to this riverside retreat to receive\r\nthe Tzar Peter in 1717, and in 1752 Louis Philippe d'Orleans set about\r\nto give a fete which should obscure the memory of all former events of a\r\nlike nature into oblivion. How well he succeeded may be a matter of\r\nvarying opinion, for the French have ever been prodigally lavish in the\r\nconduct of such affairs. At all events the occasion was a notable one.\r\n\r\nThe predilection of royalty for Saint Cloud was perhaps not remarkable,\r\nall things considered, for it was, and is, delightfully environed, and\r\nabout this time the Duc d'Orleans secretly married the Marquise de\r\nMontesson and installed her in a habitation the \"_plus simple_,\" a mere\r\nshack, one fancies, costing six millions. The _nouveau riche_ of to-day\r\ncould scarcely do the thing with more _eclat_.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution took over the park of Saint Cloud and its appurtenances\r\nand donated them to the democracy--\"for the pleasure of the people,\"\r\nread the decree.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth Brumaire, the First Republic blinked itself out in\r\nthe Palais de Saint Cloud, and the Conseil de Cinq Cents installed\r\nitself therein under the Directoire. Bonaparte, returning from Egypt,\r\narrived at Saint Cloud just as Lemercier was dissolving the Conseil.\r\nSeeing trouble ahead he commanded Murat to clear the chamber by drawn\r\nbayonets. He kept his light shining just a bit ahead of the others, did\r\nNapoleon. His watchword was initiative. Deputies clambered over each\r\nother in their haste to escape by stairway, door and window, and\r\nBonaparte saw himself Consul without opposition--for ten years--for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe royal residences were put at Napoleon's disposition and he wisely\r\nchose Saint Cloud for summer; Saint Cloud the cradle of his powers. As a\r\nrestorer and rebuilder of crumbling monuments Napoleon was a master, as\r\nhe was in the destructive sense when he was in the mood, and changes and\r\nadditions were made at Saint Cloud which for comfort and convenience put\r\nit in the very front rank of French royal residences.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1805, Pope Pius VII baptised, amid a grand pomp and ceremony,\r\nin the chapel of the palace, the son of Louis Bonaparte, and five years\r\nafterwards (April 1, 1810), the same edifice saw the religious marriage\r\nof Napoleon with Marie Louise.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 1810, a strange animation dominated all the confines of the\r\npalace. It was the occasion of the celebration of Napoleon's civil\r\nmarriage with Marie Louise. They did not enter the capital until three\r\ndays later for the ceremonial which united the daughter of the emperors\r\nwho were descendants of the Roman Caesars, to the \"Usurper,\" who was now\r\nfor the first time to rank with the other crowned heads of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe cortege which accompanied their majesties from Saint Cloud to Paris\r\nwas a pageant which would take pages to describe. The reader of these\r\nlines is referred to the impassioned pages of the works of Frederic\r\nMasson for ample details.\r\n\r\nA hundred thousand curiosity seekers had come out from Paris and filled\r\nthe alleys of the park to overflowing. Music and dancing were on every\r\nhand. Mingled with the crowd were soldiers of all ranks brilliantly clad\r\nin red, blue and gold. \"These warriors were a picturesque, obtrusive\r\nlot,\" said a chronicler; \"after having invaded Austria they acclaim the\r\nAustrian.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1815 the capitulation of Paris was signed at Saint Cloud. The gardens\r\nwere invaded by a throng which gave them more the aspect of an\r\nintrenched camp than a playground of princes. A brutal victor had\r\nclimbed booted and spurred into the bed of the great Napoleon and on\r\narising pulled the bee-embroidered draperies down with him and trampled\r\nthem under foot. Was this a proper manifestation of victory?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Gardens of Saint Cloud_]\r\n\r\nAt this period another great fete was given in the leafy park of Saint\r\nCloud, a fete which French historians have chiefly passed over silently.\r\nThe host on this occasion was the Prince of Schwartzenburg; the\r\nprincipal guests the foreign sovereigns, gloating over the downfall of\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII, after removing the traces of this desolate invasion, took\r\nup his residence here on June 18, 1817, and in the following year built\r\nthe stables and the lodgings of the Gardes du Corps. In 1820 the chapel\r\nbegun by Marie Antoinette was finished and the Jardin du Trocadero\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nCharles X in his brief reign built, on the site of an old Ursulin\r\nconvent, further quarters intended for the personnel of the court. The\r\nensemble ever took on an increasing importance. At this time were laid\r\nout the gardens between the cascades and the river, which, to some\r\nslight extent, to-day, suggest the former ample magnificence of the park\r\nas it faced upon the river. Leading through this lower garden was the\r\nAvenue Royale extending to the chateau.\r\n\r\nSaint Cloud for Charles X, in spite of his first interest therein, could\r\nhave been but an unhappy memory for here he signed the abdication which\r\nbrought about his fall. He left his palace at Saint Cloud on July 30,\r\n1830, at three o'clock in the morning, just as day was breaking through\r\nthe mists of the valley. He succumbed, the last of the Bourbons, on the\r\nsame spot on which Henri IV, as chief of the house, had first been\r\nsaluted as king.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe divided his time between Neuilly and Saint Cloud, and\r\nlent his purse and his enthusiasm to elaborating to a very considerable\r\nextent both the palace and its surroundings.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III made Saint Cloud his preferred summer residence, and was\r\nactually beneath the palace roof when the Prussian horde commenced its\r\nmarch on the capital of Clovis. He left Saint Cloud on July 27, to take\r\npersonal command of the Army of the Rhine at Metz.\r\n\r\nAs did Charles X, Napoleon III ceased to be sovereign of the French by\r\nenacting the final scene in his royal career in the Palais de Saint\r\nCloud. Never again was the palace to give shelter to a French monarch.\r\nThe empress left precipitately after the disaster of Woerth, and two\r\nmonths after the torch of arson made a ruin of all the splendour of the\r\npalace and its dependencies. The inhabitants of the little city, which\r\nhad grown up around the confines of the palace, fled in refuge to\r\nVersailles during the armistice. Scarcely an old house was preserved in\r\nall the town.\r\n\r\nAmong the _chefs d'oeuvres_ of art which perished in the flames were\r\nthe fine works of Mignard--above all, the magnificent Galerie\r\nd'Apollon--the paintings of LeMoyne, Nacret, Leloir, the marines of\r\nJoseph Vernet and innumerable objects of art which had been gathered\r\ntogether for the embellishment of Saint Cloud by the later monarchs.\r\nSome few treasures were saved by the care of the Crown Prince of\r\nPrussia, and some vases, chairs and statues were appropriated and packed\r\noff across the Rhine as the plunder of war.\r\n\r\nThe park of Saint Cloud to-day contains nearly four hundred hectares,\r\nthe public park and the \"preserve.\" From it spreads out one of the\r\nloveliest panoramas in the neighbourhood of Paris, alleyed vistas\r\nleading seemingly to infinity, with a sprinkling of statues still\r\nflanking the Jardin du Trocadero.\r\n\r\nFrom the town one enters the park through a great iron gate from the\r\nPlace Royale, or by the Avenue du Chateau, which lands one on the\r\nterraces where once stood the royal palace.\r\n\r\nFrom Ville d'Avray and from Sevres there are also entrances to the great\r\npark, while to the latter runs an avenue connecting the \"preserve\" of\r\nSaint Cloud with the wilder, more rugged Bois de Meudon.\r\n\r\nActually the surroundings of Saint Cloud's great park are the least bit\r\ntawdry. Here and there are booths and tents selling trashy souvenirs,\r\nand even more unpleasant-looking articles of food and drink, while\r\nfringing the river, and some of the principal avenues approaching the\r\ncascade, are more pretentious restaurants and eating houses which are\r\nroyal in name and their prices if nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe cascades are for the masses the chief sight of Saint Cloud to-day.\r\nHistorical souvenir plays little part in the minds of those who only\r\nvisit a monumental shrine to be amused, and so the falling waters of\r\nSaint Cloud's cascade, like the gushing torrents of Versailles'\r\nfountains, are the chief incentives to a holiday for tens of thousands\r\nof small Paris shopkeepers who do not know that a royal palace was ever\r\nhere, much less that it had a history.\r\n\r\nThere is an upper and a lower cascade, an artificial water ingeniously\r\ntumbled about according to the conception of one Lepaute, an architect\r\nof the time of the reign of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Cascades at Saint Cloud_]\r\n\r\nMansart designed the architectural attributes of the lower cascade and\r\nscores considerably over his colleague. Circular basins and canals\r\nfinally lead the water off to a still larger basin lower down where it\r\nspouts up into the air to a height of some forty odd metres at a high\r\npressure. This is the official description, but it is hard to get up any\r\nsympathy or enthusiasm over the thing, either considered as a work of\r\nart or as a diversion. Frankly, then, Saint Cloud's chief charm is its\r\nsite and its dead and half-forgotten history. The \"Tramp Abroad\" and\r\n\"Rollo\" and \"Uncle George\" knew it better than we, because in those days\r\nthe palace existed in the real, whereas we take it all on faith and\r\nregret (sometimes) that we did not live a couple of generations ago.\r\n\r\nBellevue, on the banks of the Seine, just before reaching Saint Cloud,\r\nowes its origin (a fact which the great restaurant of the Pavillon Bleu\r\nhas made the most of in its advertisements), to a caprice of Madame de\r\nPompadour. She liked the point of view (as do so many diners on the\r\nrestaurant terrace to-day), and built a \"_rendezvous-chateau_\" on the\r\nhillside, a half-way house, as it were, where Louis XV might be at his\r\nease on his journeyings to and from the capital.\r\n\r\nThe Pompadour was able to borrow a force of eight hundred workmen from\r\nthe king for as long as was necessary to carry out her ambitious\r\nprojects at Bellevue and on November 25, 1750, she had a house-warming\r\nin her modest villa (demolished in 1794) and _pendit la cremaillere_\r\nwith a ceremony whose chief entertainment was the dancing of a ballet\r\nsignificantly entitled \"L'Amour Architect.\"\r\n\r\nNeighbouring upon Saint Cloud is a whole battery of hallowed, historical\r\nspots associated with the more or less royal dwellings of the French\r\nmonarchs and their favourites. It was but a comparatively short distance\r\nto Versailles, to Saint Germain, to Maintenon and to Rambouillet, and\r\nthe near-by Louveciennes was literally strewn with the most charming\r\ncountry-houses, which, in many cases, kings paid for and made free use\r\nof, though indeed the accounts for the same may not have appeared in the\r\npublic budgets, at least not under their proper names.\r\n\r\nAt the summit of the hill which gives the town its name was a chateau\r\nbelonging originally to Madame la Princesse de Conti, and opposite the\r\nrailway station of to-day, with its prosaic and unlovely surroundings,\r\nwas a magnificent property belonging to Marechal Magnan, and the\r\nPavillon du Barry, built by the architect Ledoux to the orders of Louis\r\nXV, who would provide a convenient nest in the neighbourhood of Saint\r\nCloud for his latest favourite. To-day the pavilion exists in name,\r\nsomewhat disfigured to be sure, but still reminiscent of its former\r\nrather garish outlines, so on the whole it cannot be said to have\r\nsuffered greatly from an esthetic point of view. The property came\r\nfinally to be included as a part of the estate of Pierre Laffitte,\r\nthough still known, as it always has been, as the Pavillon du Barry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nVERSAILLES: THE GLORY OF FRANCE\r\n\r\n   \"_Glorieuse, monumentale et monotone\r\n   La facade de pierre effrite, au vent qui passe\r\n   Son chapiteau friable et sa guirlande lasse\r\n   En face du parc jaune ou s'accoude l'automne._\r\n          *       *       *\r\n   _Mais le soleil, aux vitres d'or qu'il incendie\r\n   Y semble rallumer interieurement\r\n   Le sursaut, chaque soir de la Gloire engourdi._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese lines of Henri de Regnier explain the aspect of the Versailles of\r\nto-day better than any others ever written.\r\n\r\nVersailles is a medley of verdure, a hierarchy of bronze and a forest of\r\nmarble. This is an expression full of anomalies, but it is strictly\r\napplicable to Versailles. Its waters, jets and cascades, its monsters,\r\nits Tritons and Valhalla of marble statues set off the artificial\r\nbackground in a manner only to be compared to a stage setting--a\r\nmagnificent stage setting, but still palpably unreal.\r\n\r\nYes, Versailles is sad and grim to-day; one hardly knows why, for its\r\nmemories still live, and the tangible evidences of most of its great\r\nsplendour still stand.\r\n\r\n   \"_Voici tes ifs en cone et tes tritons joufflus\r\n   Tes jardins composes ou Louis ne vient plus,\r\n   Et ta pompe arborant les plumes et les casques._\"\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to give here either an architectural review or a\r\nhistorical chronology of Versailles; either could be made the _raison\r\nd'etre_ for a weighty volume.\r\n\r\nThe writer has confined himself merely to a more or less correlated\r\nseries of patent facts and incidents which, of itself, shows well the\r\nfutility of any other treatment being given of a subject so vast within\r\nthe single chapter of a book.\r\n\r\nThe history of Versailles is a story of the people and events that\r\nreflected the glory and grandeur of the Grand Monarque of the Bourbons\r\nand made his palace and its environs a more sublime expression of\r\nearthly pomp than anything which had gone before, or has come to pass\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nVersailles, after its completion, became the perfect expression of the\r\ndecadence and demoralization of the old regime. It can only be compared\r\nto the relations between du Barry and the young Marie Antoinette, who\r\nwas all that was contrary to all for which the former stood.\r\n\r\nThat the court of Louis XV was artificially brilliant there is no doubt.\r\nIt was this that made it stand out from the sombre background of the\r\nmasses of the time. It was a dazzling, human spectacle, and Versailles,\r\nwith its extravagant, superficial charms, carried it very near to the\r\nbrink of ruin, though even in its most banal vulgarities there was a\r\ncertain sense of ambitious sincerity. The people of the peasant class\r\nlived as animals, \"black, livid and scorched by the sun.\" The sense of\r\nall this penetrated readily even to Versailles, so that La Pompadour or\r\nLouis, one or the other of them, or was it both together, cried out\r\ninstinctively: \"_Apres nous le deluge._\"\r\n\r\nThe intricacies of the etiquette of the daily life of the king, his\r\nfollies and fancies, made the history of Versailles the most brilliant\r\nof that of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--certainly it was\r\nthe most opulent. The manners of the time were better than the morals,\r\nand if good taste in art and architecture had somewhat fallen there is\r\nno doubt but that a charming fantasy often made up for a lack of\r\nestheticism.\r\n\r\nThe story of the palace, the park, the king and his court are so\r\ninterwoven that no _resume_ of the story of one can ignore that of any\r\nof the others. The king and court present themselves against this\r\nbackground with an intimacy and a clearness which is remarkable for its\r\nappeal to one's curiosity. It is a long, long day of life which begins\r\nwith the _petit lever_ and only ends with the _grand coucher_.\r\n\r\nIf there was ever a Castle of Indolence and Profligacy it was\r\nVersailles, though indeed it is regarded as the monarchy's brilliant\r\nzenith. The picture is an unforgetable one to any who have ever read its\r\nhistory or seen its stones.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1650, Martial de Lomenci, one of the ministers of Charles\r\nIX, was the Seigneur of Versailles, but at the will of Catherine de\r\nMedici he was summarily strangled that she might get possession of the\r\nproperty and make a present of it to her favourite, Albert de Gondi,\r\nMarechal de Retz.\r\n\r\nAbout 1625 Louis XIII had caused a small hunting pavilion to be built\r\nnear by and, by degrees, acquiring more land took it into his head to\r\nerect something more magnificent in the way of a country-house, though\r\nthe real conception of a suburban Paris palace only came with Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nLevau, the latter's architect, made the necessary alterations to the\r\nstructure already existing, and little by little the more magnificent\r\nproject known in its completed form to-day was evolved. War not being\r\nactually in progress, or imminent, great bodies of soldiery were set at\r\nwork with pick and shovel, and at one time thirty thousand had laid\r\naside their sabres and muskets for the more peaceful art of\r\ngarden-making under the direction of Le Notre.\r\n\r\nIn three decades the sum total of the chief roll of expenses of the\r\npalace and its dependencies reached eighty-one million, one hundred and\r\nfifty-one thousand, four hundred and fourteen _livres_, nine _sols_ and\r\ntwo _deniers_. It is perhaps even more interesting to know that of this\r\nvast sum more than three millions went for marble, twenty-one millions\r\nfor masonry, two and a half millions for the rougher woodwork and a like\r\nsum for marquetry. Other additional \"trifling\" embellishments of\r\nVersailles and the Trianon during the same period counted up another six\r\nmillion and a half.\r\n\r\nThe expense of these works was enormous on all sides. Water being\r\nrequired for the purpose of supplying the fountains it was proposed that\r\nthe waters of the Eure should be turned from their original bed and made\r\nto pass through Versailles, and the enterprise was actually begun.\r\nBeyond the gardens was formed the Little Park, about four leagues\r\naround, and beyond this lay the Great Park, measuring twenty leagues\r\naround and enclosing several forest villages. The total expenses of\r\nthese works may never have been exactly known, but they must have been\r\nimmense, that is certain, and have even been estimated at as much as one\r\nbillion francs. The works were so far completed in 1664 that the first\r\nVersailles fete was given to consecrate the palace. In honour of this\r\nevent Moliere composed \"La Princesse d'Elide.\"\r\n\r\nThe improvements, however, were continued, and in 1670, Levau, dying,\r\nwas succeeded by his nephew, Jules Hardouin Mansart, who wished to\r\ndestroy the chateau of Louis XIII and erect one uniform building. Louis\r\nXIV, out of respect to his father, would not allow Mansart's project to\r\nbe carried out and therefore alterations were only made in the court by\r\nsurrounding it on the western side with the magnificent buildings now\r\nforming the garden front. The southern wing was subsequently added for\r\nthe accommodation of the younger members of the royal family. In 1685\r\nthe northern wing was erected to meet the requirements of the attaches\r\nof the court. The chapel was commenced in 1699 and finished in 1710.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV took up his residence in the palace in 1681 with Madame de\r\nMontespan, and, thirty-five years afterwards, died there, the reigning\r\nfavourite then being Madame de Maintenon. During this time Versailles\r\nwas the theatre of many extraordinary scenes. Louis XV was born here\r\nbut did not take up his residence here until after he was of age. Here\r\nit was that his favourites Madame de Chateauroux, Madame de Pompadour\r\nand Madame du Barry found themselves most at home. It was under the\r\ndirection of this monarch that the theatre was built in the northern\r\nwing, and was formally opened on the occasion of the marriage of the\r\ndauphin, Louis XVI, in 1770.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the reign of Louis XV a new wing and pavilion were\r\nadded on the northern side of the principal court, and it was proposed\r\nto build across the court a new front in the same uniform style. The\r\nidea could not be carried out in consequence of the troublous times of\r\nLouis XVI and the enormous estimated expense. The Revolution intervened\r\nand Versailles remained closed until it was reopened by the first\r\nNapoleon, who, however, was unable to take up his residence in it on\r\naccount of his frequent campaigns afield.\r\n\r\nAt the Restoration Louis XVIII, as the representative of the ancient\r\nmonarchy, wished to make Versailles the seat of the court, but was\r\ndeterred from doing so by the appalling previous expense. During the\r\nreigns of both Napoleon and Louis XVIII considerable sums were expended\r\nin its refurbishing so that it was not wholly a bygone when finally the\r\nFrench authorities made of it, if not the chief, at least the most\r\npopular _monument historique_ of all France.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the aspect of Versailles is sadly wearying. To-day Versailles is\r\nlonely; one is haunted by the silence and the bareness, if not actual\r\nemptiness. Only once in seven years does the old palace take on any air\r\nof the official life of the Republic, and that is when the two\r\nlegislative bodies join forces and come to Versailles to vote for the\r\nnew president. For the rest of the time it is deserted, save for the\r\nguardians and visitors, a memory only of the splendours imagined and\r\nordained by Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a century the master craftsmen of a nation conspired to its\r\nbeatification, and certainly for gorgeousness and extravagance\r\nVersailles has merited any encomiums which have ever been expended upon\r\nit. It was made and remade by five generations of the cleverest workers\r\nwho ever lived, until it took supreme rank as the greatest storehouse of\r\nluxurious trifles in all the world.\r\n\r\nOne wearies though of the straight lines and long vistas of Versailles,\r\nthe endless repetition of classical motives, which, while excellent,\r\neach in its way, do pall upon one in an inexplicable fashion. It\r\npossesses, however, a certain dignity and grace in every line. This is a\r\nfact which one can not deny. It is expressive of--well, of nothing but\r\nVersailles, and the part it played in the life of its time.\r\n\r\nThe millions for Versailles were obtained in ways too devious and\r\nlengthy to follow up here. Even Louis XIV began to see before the end\r\nthe condition into which he had led the nation, though he punished every\r\none who so much as hinted at his follies. Vauban, \"the hero of a hundred\r\nsieges,\" published a book on the relations between the king and court\r\nand the tax-paying masses and was disgraced forever after, dying within\r\na few months of a broken heart that he should have been so impotent in\r\nattempting to bring about a reform.\r\n\r\nThe life of the king at Versailles had little of privacy in it. From his\r\nrising to his going to bed he was constantly in the hands of his valets\r\nand courtiers, even receiving ambassadors of state while he was still\r\nhalf hidden by the heavy curtains of his great four-poster. They had\r\nprobably been waiting hours in the Salon de l'OEl de Boeuf before\r\nbeing admitted to the kingly presence.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that Michael Chamillard, the Minister of War,\r\nintroduced billiards into France by the way of Versailles. He played\r\nwith Louis XIV and pleased him greatly, but Chamillard was no\r\nstatesman, as history and the following lines from his epitaph point\r\nout.\r\n\r\n   \"_Ci git le fameux Chamillard\r\n   De son Roy le pronotaire\r\n   Qui fut un heros au billard\r\n   Un zero dans le Ministere._\"\r\n\r\nThis apartment of the OEil de Boeuf was the ancient Cabi du Conseil.\r\nIt is a wonderfully decorated apartment, and its furnishings, beyond\r\nthose which are actually built into the fabric, are likewise of a\r\nsplendour and good taste which it is to be regretted is not everywhere\r\nto be noted in the vast palace of Louis XIV. The garnishings of the\r\nchimney-piece alone would make any great room interesting and well\r\nfurnished, and the great golden clock, finely chiselled and brilliantly\r\nburnished, is about the most satisfactory French clock one ever saw,\r\nmarking, as it does, in its style, the transition between that of Louis\r\nXIV and Louis XV.\r\n\r\nVersailles, in many respects, falls far short to-day of the ideal; its\r\nvery bigness and bareness greatly detract from the value of the historic\r\nsouvenir which has come down to us. Changes could undoubtedly be made to\r\nadvantage, and to this point much agitation has lately been directed,\r\nparticularly in cutting out some of the recently grown up trees which\r\nhave spoiled the classic vistas of the park, and the removal of those\r\nugly equestrian statues which the Monarchy of July erected.\r\n\r\nVersailles only came under Napoleon's cursory regard for a brief moment.\r\nHe hardly knew whether he would care to make his home here or not, but\r\nordered his architects to make estimates for certain projects which he\r\nhad conceived and when he got them was so staggered at their magnitude\r\nthat he at once threw over any idea that he may have had of making it\r\nhis dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution had stripped the palace quite bare; no wonder that the\r\nemperor balked at the cost of putting it in order. Napoleon may have had\r\nhis regrets for he made various allusions to Versailles while exiled at\r\nSaint Helena, but then it was too late.\r\n\r\nLouis Philippe took a matter-of-fact view of the possible service that\r\nthe vast pile might render to his family and accordingly spent much\r\nmoney in a great expanse of gaudy wall decorations which are there\r\nto-day, thinking to make of it a show place over which might preside the\r\ngenius of his sons.\r\n\r\nThese acres of meaningless battle-pieces, Algerian warfare and what not\r\nare characteristic of the \"Citizen-King\" whose fondness for red plush,\r\ngreen repp and horsehair sofas was notable. What he did at Versailles\r\nwas almost as great a vandalism against art as that wrought by the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nLast scene of all:--Under Lebrun's magnificent canopied ceiling, where\r\nthe effigy of Louis XIV is being crowned by the Goddess of Glory, and\r\nthe German eagle sits on a denuded tree trunk screaming in agony and\r\nbeating his wings in despair, William of Prussia was proclaimed Emperor\r\nof United Germany. It was almost as great an indignity as France ever\r\nsuffered; the only greater was when the Prussians marched through the\r\nArc de Triomphe de l'Etoile. That was, and is, the Frenchman's--the\r\nParisian's, at all events--culminating grief.\r\n\r\nThe apartment referred to is the Grand Galerie des Glaces (or Galerie\r\nLouis XIV), which is accredited as one of the most magnificently\r\nappointed rooms of its class in all the world. It is nearly two hundred\r\nand fifty feet in length, nearly forty feet in width, and forty-three\r\nfeet in height. It is lighted by seventeen large arched windows, which\r\ncorrespond with arched niches on the opposite wall filled with\r\nmirrors--hence the name.\r\n\r\nSixty Corinthian columns of red marble with bases and capitals of gilt\r\nbronze fill up the intervening wall spaces. The vaulted ceiling by\r\nLebrun is divided into eighteen small compartments and nine of much\r\nlarger dimensions, in which are allegorically represented the principal\r\nevents in the history of Louis XIV, from the Peace of the Pyrenees to\r\nthat of Nymeguen.\r\n\r\nIt was in this splendid apartment that Louis XIV displayed the grandeur\r\nof royalty in its highest phase and such was the luxury of the times,\r\nsuch the splendour of the court, that its immense size could hardly\r\ncontain the crowd of courtiers that pressed around the monarch.\r\n\r\nSeveral splendid fetes took place in this great room, of which those of\r\nthe marriage of the Duc de Bourgogne in 1697 and that given on the\r\narrival of Marie Antoinette were the most brilliant.\r\n\r\nFollowing are three pen-pictures of this historic palace.\r\n\r\nTHE VERSAILLES OF LONG AGO. It was to Versailles that the _Grand Roi_\r\nrepaired after his stern chase of the Spaniards across Flanders; through\r\nthe wood of Saint Germain and over those awful cobblestones which\r\nParisians know so well to-day rolled the gilded _carrosse_ of the king.\r\nHe had already been announced by a runner who had also brought news of\r\nthe latest victory. Courtiers and populace alike crowded the streets of\r\nthe town in an effort to acquire a good place from which to see the\r\narrival of the king. Intendants and servitors were giving orders on all\r\nsides, frequently contradictory, and gardeners were furbishing up the\r\nalleyed walks and flower beds in readiness for _Sa Majeste Louis\r\nQuatorze_ and all his little world of satellites. A majestic\r\neffervescence bubbled over all, and the _bourgeoisie_ enjoyed itself\r\nhugely, climbing even on roof-tops and gables in the town without the\r\npalace gates.\r\n\r\nThe _Roi Soleil_ came at last to his \"well-beloved city of Versailles.\"\r\n\"He arrived in a cloud of golden dust,\" said a writer of the time, and\r\nany who have seen Versailles blazing and treeless in the middle of a\r\nlong, hot summer, will know what it was like on that occasion.\r\n\r\nCannons roared, and the sound of revelry and welcoming joy was\r\neverywhere to be heard.\r\n\r\nTHE VERSAILLES OF YESTERDAY. The lugubrious booming of cannons came\r\nrolling over the meanderings of the Seine from the capital. The\r\nhard-heads of Paris would understand nothing; they would make flow\r\nnever-ceasing rivers of blood. The national troops were well-nigh\r\nimpotent; it was difficult to shoot down your own flesh and blood at any\r\ntime; doubly so when your native land has not yet been evacuated by a\r\nventuresome enemy. It was the time of the Commune. Traffic at\r\nVersailles was of that intensity that circulation was almost impossible.\r\nIn spite of a dismal April rain the town was full of all sorts and\r\nconditions of men. The animation of the crowd was feverish, but it was\r\nwithout joy. A convoy of prisoners passed between two lines of soldiers\r\nwith drawn bayonets. They were Frenchmen, but they were Communards. It\r\nwas but a moment before they were behind the barred doors of the\r\nbarracks which was to be their prison, packed like a troop of sheep for\r\nthe slaughter. Versailles itself, the palace and the town, were still\r\nsad. The rain still fell in torrents.\r\n\r\nTHE VERSAILLES OF TO-DAY. Roses, begonias, geraniums, the last of a long\r\nhot summer, still shed their fragrant memories over the park of\r\nVersailles. In the long, sober alleys a few leaves had already dropped\r\nfrom the trees above, marking the greensward and the gravel like a\r\n_tapis d'orient_, red and green and gold.\r\n\r\nFlora and Bacchus in their fountains seemed less real than ever before,\r\nmore sombre under the pale, trickling light through the trees. A few\r\nscattered visitors were about, sidling furtively around the Trianon, the\r\nColonnade and the _Bosquet d'Apollon_; and the birds of the wood were\r\neven now bethinking of their winter pilgrimage. Versailles was still\r\nsad. The last rays of the setting sun shot forth reflected gold from the\r\nwindows of the chateau and soon the silver blue veil of a September\r\ntwilight came down like a curtain of gauze.\r\n\r\nVersailles, the Versailles of other days, is gone forever. Who will\r\nawaken its echoes in after years? When will the Trianon again awake with\r\nthe coquetries of a queen? When will the city of the _Roi Soleil_ come\r\nagain into its own proud splendour?\r\n\r\nThe sun has set, the great iron gates of the courtyard are closed, the\r\npalace and all therein sleeps.\r\n\r\n\"_Allon nous en d'ici: laissons la place aux ombres._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE GARDENS OF VERSAILLES AND THE TRIANONS\r\n\r\n\r\nVersailles without its court of marble, its fountains, its gardens and\r\nits park, and the attendant Grand and Petit Trianons, would hardly have\r\nthe attraction that it has to-day.\r\n\r\nThe ensemble is something of more vast and varied extent than is to be\r\nseen elsewhere, though its aspect has somewhat changed from what it was\r\nof old, and the crowds of Sunday and holiday visitors give the courts\r\nand alleyed walks somewhat the aspect of a modern amusement resort.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of Versailles were but the framing of a princely dwelling\r\ncreated to respond to the requirements of a court which was attempting\r\nto do things on a grand scale. Everything was designed with most\r\nmagnificent outlines; everything was royal, in all verity--architecture,\r\ngarden-making, fetes, receptions and promenades. What setting, then,\r\ncould have been more appropriate to the life of the times?\r\n\r\nVersailles, the town, had never prospered, and has never proved\r\nsufficiently attractive to become a popular suburb; and, though to-day\r\nit passed the mark of half a hundred thousand population, it never would\r\nhave existed at all had it not been for the palace of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the palace and its attributes, Versailles would have\r\nabsolutely no memories for visitors, except such as may have lunched\r\nwell at the Hotel des Reservoirs or the Hotel du Trianon. That is not\r\neverything, to be sure; but it is something, even when one is on an\r\nhistoric pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nEven in the day of Louis XVI the popular taste was changing and\r\nVersailles was contemptuously referred to as a world of automota, of\r\ncold, unfeeling statuary and of Noah's Ark trees and forests. There was\r\nalways a certain air of self-satisfaction about it, as there is, to-day,\r\nwhen the Parisian hordes come out to see the waters play, and the\r\nsight-seers marvel at the mock splendour and the scraps of history doled\r\nout for their delectation by none-too-painstaking guardians.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, no sober-minded student of art or history will\r\never consider Versailles, the palace and the park, as other than a\r\nsuperb and a spectacular demonstration of the taste of the times in\r\nwhich it was planned, built and lived in.\r\n\r\nVersailles was begun in 1624 by Louis XIII, who built here a humble\r\nhunting-lodge for the disciples of Saint Hubert of whom he was the royal\r\nhead. So humble an erection was it that the monarch referred to it\r\nsimply as a \"_petite maison_\" and paid for it out of his own pocket, a\r\nrare enough proceeding at that epoch.\r\n\r\nThe critical Bassompierre called it a \"_chetif chateau_,\" and\r\nSaint-Simon referred to it as a \"house of cards.\" Manifestly, then, it\r\nwas no great thing. It was, however, a comfortable country-house,\r\nsurrounded by a garden and a more ample park.\r\n\r\nIt was not Lemercier, the presiding genius of the Louvre at this time,\r\nbut an unknown by the name of Le Roy, whom Louis XIII chose as his\r\narchitect.\r\n\r\nBoyceau traced the original _parterres_ with a central basin at a\r\ncrossroads of two wide avenues. Each of the four compartments thus made\r\nwas ornamented with _broderies_ and trimmed hedges, and the open spaces\r\nwere ingeniously filled with parti-coloured sands, or earth. A\r\n_parterre_ of flowers immediately adjoined the palace and rudimentary\r\nalleys and avenues stretched off towards the wood. Although designed by\r\nBoyceau, this work was actually executed by his nephew, Jacques de\r\nMenours, who, with difficulty, collected his pay. His books of account\r\nshowed that in five years, from 1631 to 1636, he had drawn but once a\r\nyear a sum varying from fifteen hundred to four thousand _livres_ while\r\nin the same period the king had spent on the rest of the work at\r\nVersailles two hundred and thirty-eight thousand _livres_, thirty-two\r\n_sols_, six _deniers_, nearly one million one hundred thousand francs of\r\nthe money of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe first of the outdoor embellishments of the palace at Versailles is\r\nthe great Cour Royale, or the Cour d'Honneur, which opens out behind the\r\nlong range of iron gates facing upon the Place d'Armes. At the foot of\r\nthis entrance court is an extension called the Cour de Marbre. This Cour\r\nde Marbre, on January 5, 1757, was the scene of the infamous attack on\r\nLouis XV by Damiens, just as the king was starting out for the Trianon.\r\n\r\nA thick redingote saved the king's life; but for \"this mere pin-prick,\"\r\naccording to Voltaire, the monarch went immediately to bed, and five\r\ntimes in succession sought absolution for his sins. Sins lay heavy even\r\non royal heads in those days.\r\n\r\nDamiens was but a thick-witted, superstitious valet, who, more or less\r\npersecuted by the noble employers with whom he had been in service at\r\nvarious times, sought to avenge himself, not on them, but on their king,\r\nas the figurehead of all that was rotten in the social hierarchy. Louis,\r\nheretofore known as the \"Bien Aime,\" had become suddenly unpopular\r\nbecause of the disastrous war against England and Germany, and his\r\nprodigal dissipation of public moneys.\r\n\r\nStretching out behind the palace are the famous gardens, the\r\n_parterres_, the _tapis vert_, the fountains and the grand canal, with\r\nthe park of the Trianons off to the right.\r\n\r\nGood fortune came to Louis XIV when he found Andre Le Notre, for it was\r\nhe and no other who traced the general lines of the garden of the\r\nVersailles which was to be. He laid a generous hand upon the park and\r\nforest which had surrounded the manor of Louis XIII, and extended the\r\ngarden to the furthermost limits of his ingenuity. Modifications were\r\nrapid, and from 1664 the _parterres_ and the greensward took on entirely\r\nnew forms and effects. The Parterre des Reservoirs became the Parterre\r\ndu Nord, and an alley of four rows of lindens enclosed the park on all\r\nsides. The Parterre a Fleurs, or the Jardin du Roy, between the chateau\r\nand the Orangerie, was laid out anew.\r\n\r\nBy the following year the park began to take on the homogeneity which\r\nit had hitherto lacked. The great Rondeau, as it was called, and which\r\nbecame later the Bassin du Dragon, was excavated, and the Jardin Bas, or\r\nthe Nouveau Parterre, with an oval depression, was also planned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cour de Marbre, Versailles_]\r\n\r\nAt one end of the park was the celebrated Menagerie du Roy, where the\r\nrare and exotic animals collected by the monarch had \"a palace more\r\nmagnificent than the home of any other dumb animals in the world.\" This\r\nwas the first period of formal garden construction at Versailles, and it\r\nwas also the period when the first great impetus was given to sculptural\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\nIn 1679, following a journey in Italy, Le Notre took up again the work\r\non the gardens at Versailles, devoting himself to the region south of\r\nthe palace which hitherto had been ignored. This was Le Notre's most\r\nprolific period.\r\n\r\nThe creations at Versailles can be divided into two distinct epochs,\r\nthat before 1670 and that coming after. After Le Notre's generous\r\ndesign, the king and queen were seemingly never satisfied with the\r\nendless plotting and planting which was carried on beneath the windows\r\nof the palace, and in many instances changed the colour schemes and even\r\nthe outlines of Le Notre's original conceptions.\r\n\r\nThe Versailles of to-day is no longer the Versailles of Louis XIII, so\r\nfar as the actual disposition of details goes. Then there was very\r\nlittle green grass and much sand and gravel, a scheme of decoration\r\nwhich entered largely into the seventeenth century garden. This refers\r\nprincipally to the general effect, for Le Notre made much use of the\r\nenclosing battery of lindens, chestnuts and elms of a majestic and\r\npatriarchal grandeur which have since been cut and replaced by smaller\r\nspecies of trees, or not replaced at all.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the ornamental gardens planned at Versailles than the\r\nPotager du Roy, or fruit and vegetable garden, was created. This same\r\ngarden exists to-day with almost its former outlines. Here a soil\r\nsufficiently humid, and yet sufficiently well drained, contributed not a\r\nlittle towards the success of this most celebrated of all kitchen\r\ngardens the world has known.\r\n\r\nThe work of installing a further system of artificial drainage was\r\nimmediately begun, and the Eaux des Suisses was created, to take the\r\nplace of a former stagnant pool near by. Undoubtedly it was a stupendous\r\nwork, like all the projects launched with regard to Versailles, but,\r\nlike the others, it was brought to a speedy and successful conclusion.\r\nThe details of the history of this royal vegetable garden are fully set\r\nforth in a work published in 1690 by the son of the designer, the Abbe\r\nMichel de la Quintinye, in two bulky volumes. \"It was meet that a royal\r\nvegetable garden should have been designed by a 'Gentleman Gardener,'\"\r\nsaid the faithful biographer in his foreword, and as such the man and\r\nthe work are to be considered here.\r\n\r\nThe work was accomplished by the combined efforts of a gracious talent\r\nand the expenditure of much money, put at La Quintinye's disposition by\r\nhis royal master, who had but to put his hand deep into the coffers of\r\nthe royal treasury to draw it forth filled with gold. Critics have said\r\nthat La Quintinye's ability stopped with the preparation of the soil,\r\nand with the design of the garden, rather than with the actual\r\ncultivation, but at all events it was he who made the garden possible.\r\n\r\nLa Quintinye adopted Arnauld d'Andilly's method of planting fruit trees\r\n_en espalier_ by training them against a wall-like background, and to\r\naccomplish this divided the garden plot, which covered an area of eight\r\nhectares (twenty acres), into a great number of subdivisions enclosed by\r\nwalls, in order to multiply to as great an extent as possible the\r\navailable space to be used for the _espaliers_. Again, these same walls\r\nserved to shelter certain varieties which were planted close against\r\nthem. If this Potager du Roy was not actually the first garden of its\r\nclass so laid out, it was certainly one of the most extensive and the\r\nmost successful up to that time.\r\n\r\nThe great terraces of at least two metres in width surrounded the\r\ncentral garden, leaving a free area for the latter which approximated\r\nthree hectares.\r\n\r\nThese terraces were divided into twenty-eight compartments, forming nine\r\ndistinct varieties of gardens.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated gardener of Louis XIV sought not only to obtain fruits\r\nand vegetables of a superior quality and an abundant quantity, but was\r\nthe first among his kind to produce early vegetables, or _primeurs_, in\r\nany considerable quantity, and, by a process of forced culture, he was\r\nable to put upon the table of the monarch asparagus in December, lettuce\r\nin January, cauliflower in March and strawberries in April. All these\r\nmay be found at the Paris markets to-day, and at these seasons, but the\r\ngrowing of _primeurs_ for the Paris markets has become a great industry\r\nsince the time it was first begun at Versailles.\r\n\r\nOf asparagus La Quintinye said, \"It is a vegetable that only kings can\r\never hope to eat.\"\r\n\r\nThe Potager du Roy was begun in 1678, and completed in 1683. It cost,\r\nall told, one million one hundred and seventy thousand nine hundred and\r\neighty-three _livres_ of which four hundred and sixty-seven thousand\r\nthree hundred and sixty-four went for constructions in brick and stone,\r\nwalls, enclosures and drains. Its annual maintenance (1685) amounted to\r\ntwenty thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine _livres_. The effort proved\r\none of great benefit to its creator, for La Quintinye, at the completion\r\nof this work, received further commissions of a like nature from the\r\nPrince de Conde, the Duc de Montansier, Colbert, Fouquet and others.\r\n\r\nSo great a marvel was this vegetable garden at Versailles that it was\r\nthe object of a pilgrimage of the Doge of Venice in 1685, and of the\r\nSiamese ambassadors in the following year. The garden has been preserved\r\nas an adjunct to Versailles up to the present day. For two centuries its\r\nproduct went to the \"Service de Bouche\" of the chief of state, that is,\r\nthe royal dinner table; but in 1875 the Minister of Agriculture\r\ninstalled there the French National Horticultural College, which to-day,\r\nwith a widened scope, has admitted ornamental plants and trees to this\r\nfamous garden. Nevertheless the general outlines have been preserved,\r\nthough certain of the terraces have disappeared, as well as many of the\r\nwalls of the original enclosure, thus reducing the number of garden\r\nplots; in fact but sixteen distinctly defined gardens remain, including\r\nthe Clos aux Asperges.\r\n\r\nThe general lines of the garden design of Le Notre and Boyceau at\r\nVersailles are to be noted to-day, but if anything the maintenance of\r\nthe gardens is hardly the equal of what it was in the time of Louis XIV\r\nand a seeming disaster has fallen upon Versailles as these lines are\r\nbeing written.\r\n\r\nThe military authorities have set aside, as a site for an aerostation\r\ncamp, some twenty-five acres of the park near Rocquencourt. This is one\r\nof the loveliest parts, shaded by magnificent trees which, presumably,\r\nwill have to be sacrificed, since, if left standing, they would\r\ncertainly interfere with maneuvering with military aeroplanes,\r\ndirigibles and balloons.\r\n\r\nAt a time when deforestation is recognized to be one of the greatest\r\ndangers that menace a country's prosperity, one of its consequences\r\nbeing such inundations as those which recently devastated Paris and the\r\nSeine valley, it is regrettable that the forest surrounding Versailles\r\nshould be depleted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Potager du Roy, Versailles_]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the realization of the project means a loss of revenue to\r\nthe state which at present derives some sixty thousand francs a year\r\nfrom the farming lease of this portion of the park.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for material considerations, as well as because Versailles\r\nand its surroundings should be preserved intact as a noble relic of one\r\nof the grandest periods of French history, one of the most beautiful\r\ncreations of French genius, the project attributed to the military\r\nauthorities is short-sighted. To diminish the attractions of Versailles\r\nwould certainly prove an unwise policy, as the stream of tourists, which\r\nis the chief source of profit to Versailles and its population, would\r\ninevitably be diverted to some other channel.\r\n\r\nOnly a short time ago a Societe des Amis de Versailles was created for\r\nthe purpose of safeguarding its artistic and natural beauties. The\r\ngovernment gave the organization its approbation and there is something\r\ndelightfully ironical in the fact that the military authorities of the\r\nsame government are planning to destroy what the society, fathered by\r\nthe Ministere des Beaux Arts, was formed to preserve.\r\n\r\nAnother modern aspect of the park of Versailles was noted during the\r\nlate winter when, after a sharp freeze, all the youth of Paris had\r\nseemingly gone out to Versailles for the skating only to be met by a\r\nfreshly-posted notice which read:\r\n\r\n   Defense\r\n   De Patiner Par\r\n   Arrete du 17 Decembre, 1849\r\n\r\n\r\nThese signs were posted here and there about the park, in the courtyard,\r\non the postern gate, on trees, everywhere. The authorities were bound\r\nthat there should be no flagrant violation of the order of 1849.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said one of the park guardians, \"_c'est defendu_; but as we\r\nare only two and the crowd is very large we can do nothing.\" This was\r\nevident. Thousands overran the Grand Canal, which at its greatest depth\r\nwas scarcely more than a yard to the bottom, and so, despite of\r\nmonarchial decree, Republican France still skates on the ornamental\r\nwaters of Versailles when occasion offers.\r\n\r\n\"_N'oubliez pas le petit balayeur, s'il vous plait_,\" was as often heard\r\nas \"_Allez vous-en_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole it was rather a picturesque sight. A thick haze hung over\r\nthe now white \"Tapis Vert,\" and the nude figures of the Bassin d'Apollon\r\nwere clothed in a mantle of snow, while the white-robed statues of the\r\nAllee Royale, one could well believe, shivered as one passed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Bassin de Latone, Versailles_]\r\n\r\nThe fountains of Versailles, the \"Grands Eaux\" and \"Petits Eaux,\" which\r\nshoot their jets in air \"semi-occasionally\" for the benefit of Paris's\r\n\"good papas\" and their children, are distinctly popular features, and of\r\nan artistic worth neither less nor greater than most garden accessories\r\nof the artificial order. The fact that it costs something like ten\r\nthousand francs to \"play\" these fountains seems to be the chief memory\r\nwhich one retains of them in operation, unless it be the crowds which\r\nmake the going and coming so uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Orangerie lies just below the terrace of the Parterre du Midi, and a\r\nthousand or more non-bearing orange trees are scattered about. They are\r\ndescendants of fifteenth century ancestors, it is claimed--but\r\ndoubtfully.\r\n\r\nThe great basin of water known as the Eaux des Suisses was excavated by\r\nthe Swiss Guard of Louis XIV to serve the useful purpose of irrigating\r\nthe Potager du Roy, and as a decorative effect of great value to that\r\npart of the garden upon which faces the fourteen-hundred-foot front of\r\nthe palace.\r\n\r\nStill farther off towards the Bois de Satory, after crossing the Tapis\r\nVert, lie the famous Bassins de Latone and Apollon, the Bassin du\r\nMiroir and, finally, the Grand Canal, with one transverse branch leading\r\nto the Menagerie (now the government stud-farm) and the other to the\r\nTrianons.\r\n\r\nThe satellite palaces known as the Grand and Petit Trianons are, like\r\nthe Palace of Versailles itself, of such an abounding historical\r\ninterest that it were futile to attempt more than a mere intimation of\r\ntheir comparative rank and aspect.\r\n\r\nThe rather sprawling, one-story, horseshoe-shaped villa built by Louis\r\nXIV for Madame de Maintenon, and known as the Grand Trianon, was an\r\narchitectural conception of Mansart's.\r\n\r\nIt is worth remarking that the Grand Trianon, to-day, is in a more\r\nnearly perfect state than it has been for long past, for the\r\nrestorations lately made have removed certain interpolations manifestly\r\nout of place.\r\n\r\nIt is due to M. de Nolhac, the Conservateur du Musee de Versailles, that\r\nthis happy amelioration has been brought about and that Mansart's\r\nadmirable work is again as it was in the days of Madame de Maintenon and\r\nthose of the later Napoleon I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Fountain of Neptune, Versailles_]\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this the Trianon of to-day is not what it was in the\r\neighteenth century. \"Madame de Maintenon,\" said de Musset, \"made of\r\nVersailles an oratory, but La Pompadour turned it into a boudoir.\" He\r\nalso called the Trianon: \"a tiny chateau of porcelain.\" It was, too, the\r\nboudoir of Madame de Montespan.\r\n\r\nLouis XV, too, built, or furnished, discreet boudoirs of this order on\r\nevery hand. More than one great gallery in which his elders had done big\r\nthings he divided and subdivided into minute apartments and papered the\r\nwalls, or painted them, all colours of the rainbow, or hung them with\r\nsilks or velvets.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think my little apartment shows good taste,\" he asked one day\r\nof the Comtesse de Seran at Versailles.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" she replied, \"I would much rather that the walls were hung\r\nin blue.\"\r\n\r\nThat particular apartment was in rose, but, since blue was the favourite\r\ncolour of the monarch, the reply was but flattering. The next time that\r\nhis friend, the Comtesse, appeared on the scene the apartment had all\r\nbeen done over in blue.\r\n\r\nThe monarch soon began to turn his attention to the gardens. Bowers,\r\nlabyrinths and vases and statues were inexplicably mixed as in a maze.\r\nHe began to have the \"_gout pastoral_,\" his biographer has said, a vogue\r\nthat Madame du Barry and Marie Antoinette came in time to push to its\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nThe king was too ready to admire all that was suggested, all that was\r\noffered, and the ultimate effect was--well, it was the opposite of what\r\nhe hoped it to be, though doubtless he did not realize it.\r\n\r\nIn the garden of the Grand Trianon is a great basin with a cascade\r\nflowing down over a sort of a high altar arrangement in red and white\r\nmarble called the Buffet de l'Architecture, and evolved by Mansart. This\r\narchitect certainly succeeded much better with his purely architectural\r\nconceptions than he did with interpolated decorative elements intended\r\nto relieve a formal landscape.\r\n\r\nThe Petit Trianon, the pride of Louis XV, was designed by the architect\r\nGabriel, and its reigning goddess was Marie Antoinette. Souvenirs of the\r\nunhappy queen are many, but the caretakers are evidently bored with\r\ntheir duties and hustle you through the apartments with scant ceremony\r\nthat they may doze again undisturbed in their corners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Petit Trianon_]\r\n\r\nThe garden of the Petit Trianon is a veritable _Jardin Anglais_, that\r\nis, the decorative portion, where sweeps and curves, as meaningless as\r\nthose one sees on banknotes and no more decorative, are found in\r\nplace of the majestic lines of the formal garden when laid out after the\r\nFrench manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _La Laiterie de la Reine PETIT TRIANON_]\r\n\r\nThe _Hameau_, where is the dairy where the queen played housewife and\r\nshepherdess, is just to the rear of this bijou palace and looks stagy\r\nand unreal enough to be the wings and back-drop of a pastoral play.\r\n\r\nNear Versailles was the Chateau de Clagny, with a garden laid out by Le\r\nNotre, quite the rival of many better known. Of it Madame de Sevigne\r\nwrote: \"It is the Palais d'Armide; you know the manner of Le Notre; here\r\nhe has done his best.\"\r\n\r\nThe Couvent des Recollettes, just across the Bois de Satory, was built\r\nby Louis XIV out of regard for the _religieux_ whom he displaced from\r\nan edifice which stood upon a plot which was actually needed for the\r\npalace gardens. The Chateaux of Noisy and Molineaux were also affiliated\r\nwith Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the surroundings and accessories of Versailles are mere\r\nadjunctive details of those chief features here mentioned. To catalogue\r\nthem even would be useless since they are all set down in the\r\nguidebooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSAINT GERMAIN-EN-LAYE\r\n\r\n\r\nSaint Germain has not the popularity of Versailles, nor the charm of\r\nFontainebleau, but it is more accessible than either, and, if less known\r\nand less visited by the general mass of tourists, it is all the more\r\ndelightful for that.\r\n\r\nSaint Germain, the chateau, the town and the forest, possess a\r\nmagnificent site. Behind is a wooded background, and before one are the\r\nmeanderings of the Seine which in the summer sunlight is a panorama\r\nwhich is to be likened to no other on earth. Across the river bottom run\r\nthe great tree-lined roadways, straight as the proverbial flight of the\r\narrow, while on the horizon, looking from the celebrated terrace, one\r\nsees to-day the silhouetted outline of Paris with the Tour Eiffel and\r\nthe dome of the Sacre Coeur as the culminating points.\r\n\r\nThe town itself is ugly and ill-paved, and heavy-booted dragoons make a\r\nhideous noise as they clank along to and from the cavalry barracks all\r\nthrough the day and night. Neither are scorching automobiles making\r\ntheir ways to Trouville and Dieppe over the \"Route des Quarante Sous\" a\r\npleasant feature. One can ignore all these things, however, for what is\r\nleft is of a superlative charm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAINT GERMAIN]\r\n\r\nSaint Germain-en-Laye in the first stages of French history was but a\r\nvast extent of forest which under Charlemagne came to the possession of\r\nthe monks of the Abbaye de Saint Germain-des-Pres. The first royal\r\npalace here was built by King Robert in the tenth century, practically\r\nupon the site of the present edifice. In the eleventh century there came\r\ninto being another royal dwelling, and in the twelfth century\r\nLouis-le-Gros built a chateau-fort as a protection to the royal\r\nresidence and monastery. This did not prevent the Black Prince from very\r\nnearly burning them down on one of his bold raids, but by 1367, Charles\r\nV re-erected the \"_castel_\" of Saint Germain-en-Laye.\r\n\r\nThe English, by coercion, induced a monk of a neighbouring establishment\r\nat Nanterre to deliver up a set of false keys by which the great gates\r\nof the castle were surreptitiously opened, and, for a time, the\r\ndescendants of the Conqueror held possession.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of Charles V in no way satisfying the artistic\r\nambitions of Francis I, that monarch gave the task of reconstruction to\r\nthe architect Pierre Chambiges, in 1539, preserving only the Saint\r\nChapelle of Saint Louis and the donjon.\r\n\r\nThe building must have gone forward with an extreme rapidity for at the\r\narchitect's death, in 1544, it had reached nearly the level of the\r\nrooftop.\r\n\r\nChambiges' successor was his son-in-law, Guillaume Guillain, who,\r\nwithout changing the primitive plan, completed the work in 1548.\r\n\r\nSaint Germain, above the first story, is essentially a construction of\r\nbricks, but the effect is even now, as Chambiges originally intended, an\r\nedifice with its main constructive elements of lower sustaining walls\r\nand buttresses of stone binding together the slighter fabric, or\r\nfilling, above. Although it is Renaissance through and through, Saint\r\nGermain shows not the slightest reminiscence of anything Italian and\r\nmust be considered entirely as an achievement of French genius.\r\n\r\nThis edifice of Francis I was more a fortress than a palace in spite of\r\nits decorative features, and Henri II, desiring something more of a\r\nluxurious royal residence, began what the historians and savants know as\r\nthe Chateau Neuf--the palace of to-day which stands high on the hill\r\noverlooking the winding Seine, to which seducing stream the gardens\r\noriginally descended in terraces.\r\n\r\nChiefly it is to Henri IV that this structure owes its distinction, for\r\npreviously work went on but intermittently, and very slowly. Henri IV\r\nbrought the work to completion and made the chateau his preferred and\r\nmost prolonged place of residence, as indeed did his successor.\r\n\r\nIt is the Chateau Neuf of the time of Henri IV which is to-day known as\r\nthe Palais de Saint Germain-en-Laye. Of the Vieux Chateau only some\r\nfragmentary walls and piles of debris, the Pavillon Henri IV, and, in\r\npart, the old royal chapel remain.\r\n\r\nActually the structure of to-day includes that part of the Hotel du\r\nPavillon Henri IV which is used as a restaurant.\r\n\r\nHenri IV and Louis XIII gave Saint Germain its first great _eclat_ as a\r\nsuburban place of sojourn, and from the comings and goings of the court\r\nof that time there gradually grew up the present city of twenty thousand\r\ninhabitants; not all of them of courtly manners, as one learns from a\r\nrecollection of certain facts of contemporary modern history.\r\n\r\nDuring the days when Mazarin actually held the reins of state the court\r\nwas frequently at Saint Germain. Louis XIV was born here, and until\r\nVersailles and Marly came into being he made it his principal dwelling.\r\n\r\nIt was in one of the magnificent apartments, too, midway between the\r\nangle turrets of the facade, Louis XIII ended his unhappy existence in\r\n1642. His own private band of musicians played a \"De Profundis\" of his\r\nown composition to waft his soul on its long journey.\r\n\r\nThe chroniclers describe one of the monarch's last conversations as\r\nfollows: \"When they transport my body to Paris after my soul has flown,\r\nLaporte, remember that place where the road turns under the hill; it is\r\na rough road, Laporte, and will surely shake my bones sadly if the\r\ndriver does not go slowly.\"\r\n\r\nThose who have journeyed out from Paris to Saint Germain by road in this\r\nlater century will appreciate the necessity for the admonition.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV, unlike Louis XIII, detested Saint Germain beyond words,\r\nbecause the towers of the Abbaye de Saint Denis, where he was destined\r\none day to be buried, were visible from the terrace. Louis XV was not so\r\nparticular for he was so morbid that he even loved, as he claimed\r\nhimself, the scent of new-made graves.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Anne d'Autriche and the royal family at Saint Germain\r\nduring the war of the Fronde was one of the most dramatic incidents of\r\nthe period. They had travelled half the night, coming from the Palais\r\nRoyal only to find a palace awaiting them which was unheated and\r\nunfurnished though the time was mid-January. Always drear and gaunt it\r\nwas immeasurably so on this occasion. Mazarin had made no provision for\r\nthe queen's arrival; there, were neither beds, tables nor linen in their\r\nproper places, no servants, no attendants of any kind, only the\r\nguardians of the palace. The queen was obliged to take rest from her\r\nfatigue on a folding camp bedstead, without covering of any kind. The\r\nprinces fared no better, actually sleeping on the floor.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of mirrors and much gold gingerbread on the walls and\r\nceilings, but no furniture. The personal belongings which the court had\r\nbrought with them were few. No one had a change of clothing even; those\r\nworn one day were washed the next. However the queen good-naturedly\r\nsmiled through it all. She called it \"an escapade which can hardly last\r\na week.\"\r\n\r\nAll Paris was by this time crying \"_Vive la Fronde_\": \"_Mort a\r\nMazarin_\": but it proved to be something more than a little affair of a\r\nweek, as we now know.\r\n\r\nAt this period, when Anne d'Autriche was practically a prisoner at Saint\r\nGermain, the picture made by the old chateau against its forest\r\nbackground was undeniably more imposing than that which one sees to-day.\r\nThe glorious forest was not then hidden by rows of banal roof-tops, and\r\nthe dull drabs of barracks and prisons.\r\n\r\nIn the warm spring mornings the glittering facade of the chateau was\r\nbrilliant as a diamond against its setting, and the radiating avenues of\r\nthe park leading from the famous terrace stretched out into infinite\r\nvistas that were most alluring. This effect, fortunately, is not wholly\r\nlost to-day.\r\n\r\nAt night things were as idyllic as by day. The queen and her ladies,\r\nrelieved of the dreary presence of the king who still remained at Paris,\r\nrevelled in an unwonted freedom. Concerts, suppers and dances were the\r\nrule and moonlight cavalcades to the heart of the forest, or promenades\r\non foot the length of the terrace, and by some romantically disposed\r\ncouples far beyond, gave a genuine \"begone, dull care\" aspect to court\r\nlife which was not at all possible in the capital.\r\n\r\nThe following picture, taken from a court chronicle, might apply as well\r\nto-day if one makes due allowance for a refulgence of myriad lamps\r\ngleaming out Parisward as night draws in.\r\n\r\n\"It is a rare moonlight night. The queen and her ladies have emerged\r\nlate on the stately terrace of Henri IV which borders upon the forest\r\nand extends for nearly a league along the edge of the height upon which\r\nstands the chateau.\r\n\r\n\"The queen and her brother-in-law, Gaston, Duc d'Orleans, have seated\r\nthemselves somewhat apart from the rest beside the stone balustrade\r\nwhich overlooks the steep descent to the plain below. Vineyards line the\r\nhillside and the Seine flows far beneath, the fertile river-bottom rich\r\nwith groves and orchards, villas and gardens. Still more distant sweeps\r\naway the great plain wrapped in dark shadows punctuated here and there\r\nwith great splotches of moonlight. Of the great city beyond (the Paris\r\nof to-day, whose myriad glow-worm lights actually do lend an additional\r\ncharm) not a vestige is to be seen. Scarcely a lantern marks the\r\nexistence of a living soul in the vast expanse below, but the moon, high\r\nin the heavens, plots out the entire landscape with a wonderful\r\nimpressiveness, and the stars topping the forest trees to the rear and\r\nthe heights which rise on the distant horizon lend their quota of\r\nromanticism, and, as if by their scintillations, mark the almost\r\nindiscernible towers of the old Abbey of Saint Denis to the left.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, what a lovely night,' said the queen to her companion. Again it is\r\nthe old chronicler who speaks. 'Can the world ever appear so calm and\r\npeaceful elsewhere?'\"\r\n\r\nThis Terrasse de Henri IV, so called, is one of the most splendid and\r\nbest-known terraces in Europe, and is noted for its extent as well as\r\nfor its marvellous point of view, the whole panorama Parisward being\r\nspread out before one as if on a map, a view which extends from the\r\nChateau de Maisons on the left to the Aqueduct de Marly and the heights\r\nof Louveciennes on the right, including the Bois de Vesinet, Mont\r\nValerian, Montmartre and the whole Parisian panorama as far as the\r\nCoteaux de Montmorency.\r\n\r\nThis terrace, too, was the project and construction of Le Notre in 1672.\r\nIt is two and a half kilometres in length and thirty metres in width,\r\nupheld by a stone retaining wall which is surmounted by a balustrade. It\r\nextends from the Pavillon Henri IV to a gun battery well within the\r\nconfines of the forest. Entrance from the precincts of the palace is by\r\nthe great ornamental iron gateway known as the Grille Royale, from which\r\nan alleyed row of lindens leads to the heart of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe record of another merry party at Saint Germain is that which\r\nrecounts that summer evening when the king and court scuttled about the\r\npark enjoying themselves as only royalty can--when some one else pays\r\nthe bills. The terrace, the gravelled walks and the alleyed paths of the\r\nforest all led to charming and discreet rendezvous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Valley of the Seine, from the Terrace at Saint\r\nGermain_]\r\n\r\nSo preoccupied was every one on this particular occasion that the\r\nmerry-makers had hardly a thought for their king, who, left to his own\r\ndevices, sought out four maids of honour gossiping in a bower, and,\r\ntaking the mischief-loving Lauzan into his confidence, pried upon them\r\nin the ambush of the night. They were gossiping over the dancers at the\r\nball of the night before when one of them proclaimed her fancy for the\r\nagility and grace of the king above all others. It was the first\r\nexpression of \"La Valliere\" since she had come timidly to court. The\r\nrest is an idyll which is found set forth in all the history books at\r\nconsiderable length, and at this particular moment it was a genuine\r\nidyll, for the king had not then become the debauched roue that he was\r\nin later life.\r\n\r\nAfter Anne d'Autriche, Henriette, the widow of Charles I of England,\r\nfound at Saint Germain a comfortable and luxurious refuge.\r\n\r\nFrom 1661 onward Louis XIV made frequent visits to Saint Germain and was\r\nso taken with the charms of the neighbourhood and the immediate site\r\nthat he conjured six and a half million francs out of his Civil List, in\r\naddition to his regular stipend, for the upkeep of this palace alone.\r\nThis was robbery: modern graft pales before this; candelabra by the\r\npound and writing tables by the square yard were known before the days\r\nof machine politicians.\r\n\r\nJames II of England, in 1688, found a hospitable refuge at Saint\r\nGermain, thanks to Louis XIV, and died within the palace walls in 1701,\r\nas did his wife, Maria d'Este, in 1718.\r\n\r\nLouis XV and Louis XVI gave Saint Germain scarce a thought, and under\r\nthe Empire it became a cavalry school, and later, under the Restoration,\r\nsinking lower still, it merited only the denomination of a barracks. Its\r\nculminating fall arrived when it was turned into a penitentiary.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III, with finer instincts, here installed a museum, and\r\nrestorations and rebuilding having gone on intermittently since that\r\ntime the palace has now taken on a certain pretence to glory.\r\nPractically the palace in its present form is a restoration, not\r\nentirely a new building, but a rebuilding of an old one, first begun\r\nunder the competent efforts of the architect Eugene Millet, who sought\r\nto reestablish the edifice as it was under Francis I. The great tower\r\nhas been preserved but the corner pavilions of the period of Louis XIV\r\nhave been demolished in accord with the carrying out of this plan.\r\n\r\nFor forty years Saint Germain has been in a state of restoration, and\r\nlike the restoration of Pierrefonds it has swallowed up fantastic sums.\r\nThe western facade has been rebuilt from the chapel to the entrance\r\nportal and the last of Mansart's pavilions, which he built to please\r\neither his own fancy or that of Louis XIV, have been demolished. Mansart\r\nhimself made way with the old _tourelles_ and the balustrade which\r\nrounded off the angles of the walls of the main buildings and\r\nsubstituted a series of heavy, ugly _maisonettes_, more like the\r\nbastions of a fortress than any adjunct to a princely dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe courtyard of the chateau is curiously disposed; \"so that it may\r\nreceive the sun at all times,\" was the claim of its designer. It, too,\r\nhas been brought back to the state in which it was originally conceived\r\nand shorn of its encumbering outhouses and odds and ends which served\r\ntheir purposes well enough when it was a barracks or a prison, but which\r\nwere a desecration to anything called by so dignified a name as a\r\nchateau or a palace. This courtyard is to-day as it was when the lords\r\nand ladies in the train of Charles IX strolled and even gambolled\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nThe Chapelle de Saint Louis (1240) is in every way remarkable,\r\nespecially with respect to its great rose-window, which was found by\r\nMillet to have been walled up by Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThe military museum of to-day, which is enclosed by the palace walls,\r\npossesses a remarkable collection of its kind, but has no intimate lien\r\nupon the history of the palace.\r\n\r\nThe _parterre_ before the palace is cut off from the forest of Saint\r\nGermain by three ornate iron gates. It was relaid, a transformation from\r\ndesigns originally conceived in 1676, by Le Notre, modified in 1750 and\r\nmuch reduced in size and beauty in the nineteenth century, though later\r\nenlarged by taking three hectares of ground from the forest and turning\r\nthem into the accepted form of an English garden.\r\n\r\nA peninsula of a superficial area of over ten thousand acres snugly\r\nenfolded in one of the great horseshoe bends of the Seine contains the\r\nForet de Saint Germain. A line drawn across the neck of the peninsula\r\nfrom Saint Germain to Poissy, following the Route de Poissy, completely\r\ncuts off this tongue of land which is as wild and wooded to-day as in\r\nthe times of Francis, the Henris and the Louis.\r\n\r\nThe _routes_ and _allees_ of the forest are traced with regularity and\r\nprecision, and historians have written them down as of a length of\r\nnearly four hundred leagues, a statement which a glance at any map of\r\nthe forest will well substantiate.\r\n\r\nHigh upon its plateau sits this historic wildwood, for the most part of\r\na soil dry and sandy, with here and there some great _mamelon_\r\n(Druidical or Pagan, as the case may be) rising somewhat above the\r\naverage level. Francis I, huntsman and lover of art and nature, did\r\nmuch to preserve this great forest, and Louis XIV in his time developed\r\nits system of roads and paths, \"chiefly to make hunting easy,\" says\r\nhistory, though it is difficult to follow this. At all events the forest\r\nremains to-day the most extensive unspoiled breathing-spot of its class\r\nnear Paris.\r\n\r\nWithin this maze of paths and alleys are many famed historic spots, the\r\nChene Saint Fiacre, the Croix de Noailles, the Croix Saint Simon, the\r\nCroix du Main (erected in 1709 in honour of the son of Louis XIV), the\r\nEtoile des Amazones, the Patte d'Oie, the Chene du Capitaine and many\r\nmore which are continually referred to in the history of the palace, the\r\nforest of Saint Germain-en-Laye, and of the Abbaye de Poissy.\r\n\r\nThe forest is not wholly separated from the mundane world for\r\noccasionally a faint echo of the Rouen railway is heard, a toot from a\r\nriver tug-boat bringing coal up-river to Paris, the strident notes of\r\nautomobile horns, or that of a hooting steam-tram which scorches along\r\nthe principal roadway over which state coaches of kings and courtiers\r\nformerly rolled. The contrast is not particularly offensive, but the\r\nrailway threatens to make further inroads, so one hardly knows the\r\nfuture that may be in store for the patriarch oaks and elms and\r\nchestnuts which make up this secular wildwood. Their ages may not in\r\nall cases approach those of the great Fontainebleau trees, and in point\r\nof fact the forest is by no means as solitary, nor ever was. One of the\r\nmost celebrated, certainly one of the most spectacular, duels of history\r\ntook place in the park at Saint Germain-en-Laye.\r\n\r\nGui Chabot de Jarnac lived a prodigal and profligate life at the\r\nexpense--it was said--of the favours of the Duchesse d'Etampes. The\r\ndauphin, Henri, making an accusation, deemed wholly uncalled for, a\r\n\"_duel judiciaire_\" took place, with La Chataigneraie as the dauphin's\r\nsubstitute as adversary of de Jarnac who sought no apology but combat.\r\n\r\nIt was because Henri meantime had become king and issued his first\r\nLetters Patent to his council concerning the \"_duel judiciaire_,\"\r\nwhereby he absolved himself of the right to partake, that he appointed\r\nhis dear friend Francois de Vivonne, \"Seigneur de la Chataigneraie,\" to\r\nplay the role for him.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the young man could not justify by victory the honour of\r\nhis king and before the monarch and the assembled court he was laid low\r\nby his adversary.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the last of the \"_duels judiciaires_\" in France. What\r\nSaint Louis and Philippe-le-Bel had vainly sought to suppress, the\r\nprocedure having cost at least a hundred thousand _livres_, was\r\npractically accomplished by Henri II by a stroke of the pen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nMAINTENON\r\n\r\n\r\nOut from Paris, on the old Route d'Espagne, running from the capital to\r\nthe frontier, down which rolled the royal corteges of old, lie Maintenon\r\nand its famous chateau, some sixty odd kilometres from Paris and twenty\r\nfrom Rambouillet.\r\n\r\nJust beyond Versailles, on the road to Maintenon, lies the trim little\r\ntownlet of Saint Cyr, known to-day as the West Point of France, the\r\nmilitary school founded by Napoleon I giving it its chief distinction.\r\n\r\nGoing back into the remote past one learns that the village grew up from\r\na foundation of Louis XIV, who bought for ninety-one thousand _livres_\r\n\"a chateau and a convent for women,\" that Madame de Maintenon might\r\nestablish a girls' school therein. She reserved an apartment for\r\nherself, and one suspects indeed that it was simply another project of\r\nthe Widow Scarron to have a place of rendezvous near the capital.\r\nCertainly under the circumstances, taking into consideration the good\r\nthat she was doing for orphaned girls, she might at least have been\r\nallowed the right of a roof to shelter her when she wished. She was\r\nabsolutely dominant within, though never actually in residence for any\r\nlength of time. It was here that \"Esther\" and \"Athalie,\" which Racine\r\nhad composed expressly for Madame de Maintenon's pensionnaires, were\r\nproduced for the first time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fauteuil _of_ Mme. _de_ Maintenon _Worked by the_\r\nDemoiselles _of_ Saint Cyr]\r\n\r\nWhen not actually living at Saint Cyr it was Madame de Maintenon's\r\ncustom to come hither from Paris each day, arriving between seven and\r\neight in the morning, passing the day and returning to town for the\r\nevening, much as a celebrated American millionaire journalist, whose\r\ncountry-house overlooks the famous convent garden, does to-day.\r\n\r\nMadame de Maintenon actually went into retirement at Saint Cyr upon the\r\ndeath of Louis XIV, and for four years, until her death, never left it.\r\nShe died from old age, rather than from any grave malady, in this\r\n\"Maison d'Education,\" which she had inaugurated, and was buried in the\r\nchapel, beneath an elaborate tomb which the Duc de Noailles, who married\r\nher niece, caused to be erected. The tomb was destroyed during the\r\nRevolution and the \"Maison Royale de Saint Cyr,\" of which nothing had\r\nbeen changed since its foundation, was suppressed, the edifice itself\r\nbeing pillaged and the remains of Madame de Maintenon sadly profaned,\r\nfinally to be recovered and deposited again in the chapel where a simple\r\nblack marble slab marks them in these graven words:\r\n\r\n   Cy-Git Madame De Maintenon\r\n   1635-1719-1836\r\n\r\nNapoleon I established the Ecole Militaire at Saint Cyr, from which are\r\ngraduated each year more than four hundred subaltern officers.\r\n\r\nThe ancient gardens of Madame de Maintenon's time now form the \"Champs\r\nde Mars,\" or drill ground, of the military school.\r\n\r\nSouth from Saint Cyr runs the great international highroad, the old\r\nRoute Royale of the monarchy. It rises and falls, but mostly straight as\r\nthe flight of the crow, until it crosses the great National Forest of\r\nRambouillet. Following the valley of the Eure almost to its headwaters\r\nit finally comes to Maintenon, a town of a couple of thousand souls,\r\nwhose most illustrious inhabitant was that granddaughter of\r\nTheodore-Agrippa d'Aubigne, named Francoise, and who came in time to be\r\nthe Marquise de Maintenon.\r\n\r\nThe Chateau de Maintenon was royal in all but name. The Tresorier des\r\nFinances under Louis XI, Jean Cottereau (a public official who made good\r\nit seems, since he also served in the same capacity for Charles VIII,\r\nLouis XII, and Francis I), had a single daughter, Isabeau, who, in 1526,\r\nmarried Jacques d'Angennes, who at the time was already Seigneur de\r\nRambouillet.\r\n\r\nAs a dot this daughter acquired the lands of Maintenon. The property was\r\nafterwards sold to the Marquis de Villeray, from whom Louis XIV bought\r\nit in 1674 and disposed of it as a royal gift to Francoise d'Aubigne,\r\nthe fascinator of kings, who was afterwards to become (in 1688) Madame\r\nLa Marquise de Maintenon.\r\n\r\nThis ambitious woman subsequently married her niece to the Duc d'Ayen,\r\nson of the Marechal de Noailles, and as a marriage portion--or possibly\r\nto avoid unpleasant consequences--turned over the property of Maintenon\r\nto the young bride and her husband to whose family, the Noailles, it has\r\never since belonged.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Duc and Duchesse de Noailles make lengthy stays in this\r\ndelightful seigneurial dwelling, and since the apartments are full to\r\noverflowing of historical souvenirs of their family it may be truly said\r\nthat their twentieth century life is to some considerable extent in\r\naccord with the traditions of other days.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this princely residence is an agreeable reminder of the\r\nlife of luxury of the olden time albeit certain modernities which we\r\nto-day think necessities are lacking.\r\n\r\nMaintenon is certainly one of the most beautiful so-called royal\r\nchateaux of France, if not by its actual importance at least by many of\r\nthe attributes of its architecture, the extent of the domain and the\r\nhistory connected therewith. It bridges the span between the private\r\nchateau and those which may properly be called royal.\r\n\r\nIn the moyen-age Maintenon was a veritable chateau-fort, forming a\r\nquadrilateral edifice flanked by round towers at three of its angles,\r\nand at the fourth by a great square mass of a donjon, all of which was\r\nunited by a vast expanse of solidly built wall which possessed all the\r\nclassic attributes of the best military architecture of its time.\r\nEntrance was only over a deep moat spanned by a drawbridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chateau de Maintenon_]\r\n\r\nJean Cottereau made his acquisition of the domain towards 1490 and\r\nimmediately planned a new scheme of being for the old fortress which,\r\naccording to a more esthetic conception, would thus be brought into the\r\nclass of a luxurious residential chateau. He destroyed the _courtines_\r\nwhich attached the great donjon to the rest of the building, and opened\r\nup the courtyard so that it faced directly upon the park. He ornamented\r\nsumptuously the window framings, the dormer windows, and the turrets,\r\nand framed in the entrance portal with a series of sculptured motives\r\nwhich he also added to the entrance to the great inner stairway. In\r\nshort it was an enlargement and embellishment that was undertaken, but\r\nso thoroughly was it done that the edifice quite lost its original\r\ncharacter in the process. Like all the chateaux built at this epoch\r\nMaintenon was no longer a mere fortress, but a palatial retreat,\r\nluxurious in all its appointments, and shorn of all the manifest\r\nmilitant attributes which it had formerly possessed.\r\n\r\nThe shell was there, following closely the original outlines, but the\r\nadded ornamentation had effectually disguised its primordial existence.\r\nLiving rooms needed light and air, while a fortress or quarters for\r\ntroops might well be ordained on other lines. The Renaissance livened up\r\nconsiderably the severe lines of the Gothic chateaux of France, and\r\nthough invariably the marks of the transition are visible to the expert\r\neye it is also true, as in the case of Maintenon, that there is\r\nfrequently a homogeneousness which is sufficiently pleasing to\r\neffectually cover up any discrepancies which might otherwise be\r\napparent. The warrior aspect is invariably lost in the transition, and\r\nthus a Renaissance residential chateau enters at once into a different\r\nclass from that of the feudal fortress regardless of the fact that such\r\nmay have been its original status.\r\n\r\nThe armorial device of Jean Cottereau--three unlovely lizards blazoned\r\non a field of silver--is still to be seen sculptured on the two towers\r\nflanking the entrance portal which to-day lacks its old drawbridge\r\nbefore mentioned. Surrounding the edifice is a deep, unhealthful,\r\nmosquito-breeding moat which is all a mediaeval moat should be, but which\r\nis actually no great attribute to the place considering its\r\ndisadvantages. One wonders that it is allowed to exist in so stagnant a\r\ncondition, as the running waters of the near-by Eure might readily be\r\nmade use of to change all this. The site of the chateau at the\r\nconfluence of the Eure and the Voise is altogether charming.\r\n\r\nMadame de Maintenon did much to make the property more commodious and\r\nconvenient and built the great right wing which binds the donjon to the\r\nmain _corps de logis_. Her own apartments were situated in the new part\r\nof the palace. She also built the gallery which leads from the Tour de\r\nMachicoulis to the pointed chapel, which was a construction of the time\r\nof Cottereau, an accessory which every self-respecting country-house of\r\nthe time was bound to have. It was by this gallery that the open tribune\r\nin the little chapel was reached, thus enabling Louis XIV to pass\r\nreadily to mass while he was so frequent a visitor at that period when,\r\nat Maintenon, he was overseeing the construction of his famous aqueduct.\r\n\r\nMaintenon has had the honour, too, to count among its illustrious guests\r\nRacine, who came at the request of Madame de Maintenon, and here wrote\r\n\"Esther\" and \"Athalie\" which were later produced at Saint Cyr by Madame\r\nde Maintenon's celebrated band of \"Demoiselles.\"\r\n\r\nLouis XIV was not the last of royal race to accept the Chateau de\r\nMaintenon's hospitality for the unhappy Charles X was obliged to ask\r\nshelter of its chatelain for himself and fleeing family. They arrived a\r\nlittle after midnight of a hot August night, slept as well as possible\r\nin the former apartments of Madame de Maintenon, and attended mass in\r\nthe chapel on the following morning. The monarch then discharged the\r\nroyal guard and the \"hundred Swiss\" and gave up, defeated at the game of\r\nplaying monarch against the will of the people.\r\n\r\nOne enters the _Cour d'Honneur_ by a great portal of the time of Louis\r\nXIV. Immediately before one is the principal facade, with its towers of\r\nbrick and its slender little turrets framing in so admirably the\r\nentrance door. This facade is of the fifteenth century and on the tympan\r\nof the dormer windows one may still see the monogram of its builder,\r\nCottereau. The drawbridge has been made way with, and the turrets over\r\nthe portal have been bound together by a diminutive balcony of stone,\r\nwhich, while a manifest superfluity, is in no way objectionable.\r\n\r\nUnder the entrance vault are doors on either side giving access to the\r\nliving apartments of the _rez-de-chaussee_. In the inner courtyard is to\r\nbe found the most exquisite architectural detail of the whole fabric,\r\nthe tower which encloses the monumental stairway, to which entrance is\r\nhad by a portal which is a veritable Gothic jewel. In the tympan of this\r\nportal, as in the dormer windows, is the device of Jean Cottereau,\r\nexcept in this case it is much more elaborate--a Saint Michel and the\r\ndragon, surrounded by a \"_semis de coquilles_\" bearing the escutcheons\r\nof the chatelain--_d'argent a lezards de sable_.\r\n\r\nAt the left of this stairway tower is the principal courtyard facade,\r\nsupported by four arcades, pierced with great windows and surmounted by\r\ntwo fine dormer windows, all in the style of Louis XII, of which the\r\nsame effects to be observed at Blois and in the Hotel d'Alluye are\r\ncontemporary.\r\n\r\nAt the left of the inner court is the wing built by Cottereau which\r\nterminates in a great round tower, while to the right is that erected by\r\nMadame de Maintenon ending at the donjon. Directly opposite is a\r\nmagnificent vista over the canal of ornamental water framed on either\r\nside by patriarchal trees and having as a background the silhouette of\r\nthe arches of the famous aqueduct which was to lead the waters of the\r\nEure to Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the chateau is not less remarkable than the exterior.\r\nEntering by the tower portal one comes at once to that magnificent\r\n_grand escalier_ which is accounted one of the wonders of the French\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nThe Salle a Manger of to-day was the old-time Salle des Gardes. It is\r\ngarnished with a fine wainscoting and panels of Cordovan leather. The\r\nChambre a Coucher of Louis XIV, to the left, is to-day the Salon, and\r\nhere are to be seen portraits of Louis XIV, Louis XII, Francis I, Henri\r\nIV, and Louis XIII.\r\n\r\nA tiny rotunda contains a statue of Henri IV as a child, and portraits\r\nof Madame de Maintenon and Louis XIV in their youth. A portrait gallery\r\nof restrained proportions contains effigies of Madame de Maintenon and\r\nher niece Mademoiselle d'Aubigne, the Duc de Penthievre, the Comtesse de\r\nToulouse, the Duc de Noailles, the Duchesse de Villars and the Duchesse\r\nde Chaumont.\r\n\r\nThe show-piece of the chateau, albeit of recent construction, is known\r\nvariously as the \"Grand Galerie\" and the \"Longue Galerie.\" Its\r\ndecorations are due to the Duc de Noailles, the father of the present\r\nproprietor. Virtually it is a portrait gallery of the Noailles family,\r\ngoing back to the times of the Crusaders and coming down to the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe apartments of Madame de Maintenon form that portion of the chateau\r\nwhich has the chief sentimental interest. In an ante-chamber is a\r\n_chaise a porteurs_ once having belonged to the Marquise, and her\r\nportrait by Mignard. Cordovan leather is hung upon the walls, and the\r\nrestored sleeping-room is hung with a canopy and separated from the rest\r\nof the apartment by a balustrade in _bois dore_. Above the\r\nchimney-piece is a portrait of Louis XIV, after Rigaud, and, finally,\r\nthe oratory is ornamented by a series of elegant sculptures in wood and\r\na magnificent Boule coffer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Aqueduct of Louis XIV at Maintenon_]\r\n\r\nIn the left wing is found a beautiful chapel of the fifteenth century,\r\nwhich is very pure in style. It is decorated with a series of\r\nRenaissance wood panels of the finest workmanship. The coloured glass of\r\nthe windows is of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe rebuilt monumental stairway connects directly with a passage leading\r\nto the entrance portico which opens on the garden terrace before the\r\n_parterre_.\r\n\r\nThe park of Maintenon is in every way admirable, with its _pelouse_, its\r\ngreat border of trees, its waterways and more than thirty bridges. Jean\r\nCottereau himself planned the first vegetable and fruit garden, or\r\n_potager_, the same whose successor is the delight of the dwellers at\r\nMaintenon to-day.\r\n\r\nThe _parterre_, the Grand Canal and the two avenues of majestic trees\r\nwere due to the conception of Le Notre, and their effect, as set off by\r\nthe alleyed forest background and the pillars of the aqueduct of Louis\r\nXIV, is something unique.\r\n\r\nThe gardens at Maintenon were perhaps not Le Notre's most famous work\r\nbut they followed the best traditions of their time, and because of\r\ntheir vast expanse of ornamental water were, in a way, quite unequalled.\r\n\r\nAmbling off towards the forest is a great avenue flanked with high\r\noverhanging shade trees known as the Allee Racine. It gets its name from\r\nthe fact that the dramatist was wont to take his walks abroad in this\r\ndirection and woo the muse while he was a guest of Madame de Maintenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nRAMBOUILLET AND ITS FOREST\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chateau de Rambouillet]\r\n\r\n\r\nRambouillet is one of the most famous of the minor royal chateaux of\r\nFrance. Built under the first of the monarchies, in the midst of the\r\nvast forest of Yveline, it has always formed a part of the national\r\ndomain. Even now, under Republican France, it is still the scene of the\r\nhunts organized for visiting monarchs, and, within the last half dozen\r\nyears alone, the monarchs of Spain and Belgium, Italy and England have\r\nshot hares and stags and pheasants in company with a Republican\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nThe occasions have lacked the picturesque costumes of the disciples of\r\nSaint Hubert in other times; but the huntsman still winds his horn to\r\nthe same traditional tune and the banquets given in the chateau on such\r\noccasions are, in no small measure, an echo of what has gone before.\r\n\r\nIt was in the old chateau of Rambouillet that Francis I died. In the\r\nmonth of March, 1547, Francis, coming from Chambord in the south,\r\ncrossed the \"accursed bridge\" and arrived at the foot of the ivy-grown\r\ndonjon which one sees to-day, the last remaining relic of the mediaeval\r\nfortress. For a year the monarch had led a wandering life, revisiting\r\nall the favourite haunts of his kingdom, and, though scarce turned\r\nfifty, was prematurely aged and gray.\r\n\r\nHe was lifted tenderly from his royal coach, and by the winding stair,\r\ncarried slowly to his apartments on the second floor, overlooking the\r\nthree canals and the \"accursed bridge\" and the tangled forest beyond.\r\n\r\nJacques d'Angennes, to whose ancestors Rambouillet one day belonged,\r\nacted as host to his royal master and cared for him as a brother, but\r\nFrancis was dispirited, and growing weaker every moment. He complained\r\nbitterly of the death of his favourite son from the plague, and of that\r\nof the gay monarch across the channel, his old friend, Henry VIII of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHe was restless and wished to move on to Saint Germain, but his\r\ncondition made that impossible. After a feeble attempt to rouse himself\r\nfor a hunt in the forest, he took to his bed again, with the admonition\r\nto his friend d'Angennes, who never left him: \"I am dying, send for my\r\nson, Henri.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince joined the mourners around the royal bedside and heard his\r\nfather's confession thus: \"My son, I have sinned greatly; I have been\r\nled away by my passions; follow that which I have done that is\r\naccredited good, and ignore the evil; above all, cherish France; be good\r\nto my people.\"\r\n\r\nThat was all except the final counsel to \"beware of the Guises; they are\r\ntraitors.\" After that he spoke no more. Francis I, the gallant,\r\nart-loving monarch, the father of the Renaissance in France, was dead.\r\n\r\nIn 1562, Catherine de Medici, accompanied by her son Charles IX, here\r\nawaited the results of the momentous battle of Dreux. In 1588, Henri\r\nIII, fleeing Paris after the \"_journee des barricades_\" came here to\r\nrest, and so fatigued was he on his arrival that he went to bed \"_tout\r\nbotte_.\"\r\n\r\nThe son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan came into possession of\r\n\"the palace and lands\" and in his honour the property was made, in spite\r\nof its limited area, a Duche-Pairie.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV and Madame de Maintenon, as was but natural, because of its\r\nproximity to Maintenon and to Paris, frequently honoured Rambouillet\r\nwith their presence; and, a little later, Louis XV and the beautiful\r\nComtesse de Toulouse followed suit.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Penthievre, to whom the property had by this time descended,\r\nat the instance of Louis XVI, ceded to that monarch the domain of\r\nRambouillet.\r\n\r\nLouis XVI built vast commons and outbuildings, all with some\r\narchitectural pretence, to house the appanage of the royal hunt, and\r\nalso built the Laiterie de la Reine and the model farm where, in 1786,\r\nhe established the first national sheepfold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Laiterie de la Reine, Rambouillet_]\r\n\r\nTo-day this is the famous Ecole de Bergers, where is quartered the\r\nlargest flock of _moutons a laine_ (merino sheep) in France, they\r\nhaving been brought chiefly from Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Laiterie de la Reine was a tiny sandstone temple with interior\r\nfittings chiefly of white marble, and with a great, round centre-table,\r\nand smaller tables in each corner, equally of marble, as becomes a\r\nhygienically fitted dairy. It was restored by Louis Napoleon during the\r\nSecond Empire, and is still to be seen in all its pristine glory.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Louis XVI had at Rambouillet a private domain of a\r\nconsiderable extent which only the Constitution of 1791 united to the\r\nCivil List. This property, except the palace, the park and the forest,\r\nwas sold later by the State. The Imperial Civil List, formed in 1805 by\r\nNapoleon, included these dependencies specifically, and the emperor\r\nfrequently hunted in the neighbouring forest, though, compared to his\r\npredecessors, he had little time to devote to that form of sport. Here,\r\ntoo, was signed, in 1810, the decree which united Holland with the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nRambouillet has fallen sadly since the Revolution. A decree of the\r\n_Representants du Peuple_, of October 14, 1793, provided that \"the\r\nfurnishings of this palace, heretofore royal, shall be sold.\" Under the\r\nConsulate and Empire a certain citizen, Trepsat by name, received an\r\ninjury in protecting Napoleon in an attack and, as recompense, was made\r\nthe official Architect and Conservator of the Palace of Rambouillet.\r\n\r\nHardly had Trepsat entered upon his functions when he suggested the\r\ndemolition of the chateau. Napoleon hesitated, but finally partially\r\nagreed, insisting, however, that enough should be left to form a\r\ncomfortable hunting-lodge. Trepsat would have torn down all and rebuilt\r\nanew. Napoleon made an appointment with his architect to visit the\r\nproperty and discuss the matter in detail the following year (1805), but\r\nat that moment he was campaigning in Austria, so the interview was not\r\nheld. This was Trepsat's chance, and he found a pretext to overthrow the\r\nentire east wing, but was stopped before he was able to further carry\r\nout his ignorant act of vandalism. Trepsat was severely reprimanded by\r\nthe emperor himself, and was ordered to put things back as he found\r\nthem. \"Even the most battered and sickly architect who ever lived could\r\nhardly have had a worse inspiration,\" said Napoleon. Trepsat, be it\r\nrecalled, had lost a leg.\r\n\r\nThe restoration was commenced, but Trepsat, committing one fault after\r\nanother, and finally juggling with the accounts, was obliged to take on\r\na collaborator by the name of Famin, a young _pensionnaire_ of the\r\nAcademie des Beaux Arts, recently returned from Rome. It was he who\r\nsaved Rambouillet from utter destruction.\r\n\r\nThe apartments of Napoleon, which were those given over to public\r\nfunctions in the time of the Comte de Toulouse, had been, and were, most\r\nluxuriously appointed. That which shows most clearly the imprint of the\r\nimperial regime is the curious Salle de Bains which was in direct\r\ncommunication with the study, or Cabinet de Travail.\r\n\r\nIt might have been a room in a Pompeian house so classic were its lines\r\nand decorations. There was a series of medallions painted on the wall\r\nrepresenting portraits of members of the imperial family. These were\r\nchiefly portraits of the female sex, and Napoleon, the first time he\r\nentered his bath, in an excess of modesty and fury cried out: \"Who is\r\nthe ass that did this thing?\" Immediately they were painted out, and,\r\nfor the sum of nine hundred and fifty francs, another artist was found\r\nwho filled the frames of the medallions with sights and scenes\r\nassociated less intimately with Napoleonic history.\r\n\r\nUnder the Empire the architect Famin was commissioned to furnish a\r\nseries of architectural embellishments to the gardens of Rambouillet.\r\nVarious stone statues were added and an octagon pavilion on the Ile des\r\nRoches was restored and redecorated. Two great avenues were cut through\r\nthe _parterre_, and, as if fearing indiscretions on the part of his\r\nentourage, the emperor caused to be planted long rows of lindens and\r\ntulip trees, which were again masked by two rows of poplars. The\r\n_peloux_ of the Jardin Francais were reestablished and the curves and\r\nsweeps of the paths of the Jardin Anglais laid out anew.\r\n\r\nThis ancient government property, arisen anew from its ruins, now bore\r\nthe name of the Pavillon du Roi de Rome, after the son of Napoleon. The\r\nEcuries, or stables, which had been built by Louis XVI, were transformed\r\ninto kennels, and various \"posts,\" or miniature shooting-boxes, were\r\ndistributed here and there through the park.\r\n\r\nUnder the Restoration the transformation of the chateau, which had been\r\nprojected ever since the time of Louis XVI, undertaken and then\r\nabandoned by Napoleon, was again commenced, but on a less ambitious\r\nscale than formerly. Chiefly this transformation consisted of opening up\r\nwindows, thus making practically a new facade. It was not wholly a happy\r\nthought, and the spirit of economy of Louis XVIII, no less, perhaps,\r\nthan other motives, arrested this mutilation and the architect was\r\ndischarged from his functions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chateau de Rambouillet_]\r\n\r\nAgain the hand of fate fell hard upon Rambouillet and its definite\r\neclipse as a royal abode came with the abdication of Charles X. The\r\nabdication was actually signed at Rambouillet, and here, in the same\r\nSalle du Conseil, the dauphin renounced the throne in favour of the\r\nyoung Duc de Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nIt was at Rambouillet that Charles X passed those solemn last days\r\nbefore the abdication. He had been unmercifully harassed at Paris and\r\nsought a quiet retreat, \"not too far from the Tuileries,\" where he might\r\nrepose a moment and take counsel. In view of later events this was\r\nsignificant; perhaps it was significant at the time, for the king\r\nspeedily repented his abdication. It was too late, for he had classed as\r\nrebels all the royalists who would have accepted the \"infant king\" as\r\ntheir monarch, even though the following Revolution prevented this.\r\n\r\nIt was on the third of August that the commissioners, deputies of the\r\nProvisionary Government, were brought before the king at Rambouillet.\r\nThey announced that twenty-five thousand armed Parisians were marching\r\non the chateau to compel him to quit his kingdom. It was not a matter\r\nfor debate, and at nine o'clock on the same night the monarch gave\r\nassent to being conducted to Cherbourg, where he embarked upon his fatal\r\nexile.\r\n\r\nAfter 1830, with a business-like instinct, the authorities rented the\r\nproperty for twelve years to the Baron Schickler, and, at the end of the\r\nRevolution of 1848, its career became more plebeian still; it was rented\r\nto a man who converted the palace into an elaborately appointed\r\nroad-house, and the lawns and groves into open-air restaurants and\r\ndancing places.\r\n\r\nUnder the Gouvernement du Juillet the chateau, the park and the forest\r\nwere removed from the Civil List, and entered upon the inventory of the\r\nAdministration des Domaines.\r\n\r\nUnder the Second Empire Rambouillet appeared again on the monarchial\r\nCivil List. Napoleon III came here at times to hunt, but not to live,\r\nand of his rare appearances at the chateau but little record exists.\r\nSince 1870 Rambouillet has belonged to the Republican Government, and,\r\nsince royalties no longer exist in France, Republican chiefs of state\r\nnow take the lead in Rambouillet's national hunts.\r\n\r\nThe property, as it stands to-day, is divided readily into four distinct\r\nparts, the palace, the _parterre_, the _Jardin Anglais_ and the park.\r\nThe grove of lindens is remarkable in every respect, the ornamental\r\nwaters are gracious and of vast extent, and the _Laiterie_ and the\r\n_Ferme_ are decidedly models of their kind; but the Chaumiere des\r\nCoquillages, a rustic summer-house of rocks and shells and questionable\r\ndebris of all sorts, is hideous and unworthy.\r\n\r\nNot the least of the charming features of the park is the great alley of\r\nLouisiana cypresses, one of the real sights, indeed, perfecting the\r\ncharm of the great body of water to the left of the chateau.\r\n\r\nOf the structure which existed in the fourteenth century, the chateau of\r\nRambouillet retains to-day only a great battlemented tower, and some\r\nlow-lying buildings attached to it. Successive enlargements,\r\nrestorations and mutilations have changed much of the original aspect of\r\nthe edifice, and modern structures flank and half envelop that which, to\r\nall eyes, is manifestly ancient. The debris of the old fortress, which\r\nwas the foundation of all, adds its bit to the conglomerate mass of\r\nwhich the chief and most imposing elements are the two tall _corps de\r\nlogis_ in the centre.\r\n\r\nWithin, a rather banal Salle de Bal is shown as the chief feature, but\r\nit is conventionally unlovely enough to be passed without emotion, save\r\nthat its easterly portion takes in the _cabinet_, or private apartment,\r\nwhere Charles X signed his abdication. Adjoining this is the bedroom\r\noccupied by that monarch, and a dining-room which also served His\r\nMajesty, and which is still used by the head of the government on\r\nceremonious occasions. Its decorative scheme is of the period of Louis\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nThe Salle de Conseil is of the period of Charles X, and has some fairly\r\nimposing carved wainscotings showing in places the monograms of Marie\r\nSophie and the Comtesse de Toulouse.\r\n\r\nA great map, or plan, of the Forest of Rambouillet covers the end wall,\r\nand, if not esthetically beautiful, is at least useful and very\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nIt was executed under Louis XVI and doubtless served its purpose well\r\nwhen the hunters gathered after a day afield and recounted anecdotes of\r\ntheir adventures.\r\n\r\nThere is another apartment on the ground floor which is known as the\r\n_Salle a Manger des Rendezvous de Chasse_, whose very name explains well\r\nits functions.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet de Travail of Marie Antoinette and the Salle de Bain of\r\nNapoleon have something more than a mere sentimental interest; they were\r\ndecidedly practical adjuncts to the royal palace.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's bath took the form of a rather short, deep pool. Its fresco\r\ndecorations, as seen to-day--replacing that family portrait gallery\r\nwhich Napoleon caused to be painted out--are after the pseudo-antique\r\nmanner and represent bird's-eye views of various French cities and\r\ntowns, while a series of painted armorial trophies decorates the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nOn the second floor are the apartments occupied by the Duchesse de Berry\r\nand those of the Duchesse d'Angouleme.\r\n\r\nIn the great round tower is the circular apartment where Francis I\r\nbreathed his last. It is this great truss-vaulted room that most\r\ninterests the visitor to Rambouillet.\r\n\r\nOn the ground floor is another Salle de Bain, quite as theatrically\r\ndisposed as that of Napoleon. Its construction was due to the Comte de\r\nToulouse whose taste ran to Delft tiles and polychrome panels, framing\r\ntwo imposing marines, also worked out in tiles.\r\n\r\nThe _parterre_, extending before the main building, is of an ampleness\r\nscarcely conceivable until once viewed. It is purely French in design\r\nand is of the epoch of the tenancy of the Comte de Toulouse. Before the\r\nadmirably grouped lindens was a boathouse, and off in every direction\r\nran alleys of acacias, while here and there tulip beds, rose gardens and\r\nhedges of rhododendrons flanked the very considerable ornamental waters.\r\nThis body of water, in the form of a trapezoid, is divided by four\r\ngrass-grown islets and separates the Jardin Anglais from the Jardin\r\nFrancais. One of the islets is known as the Ile des Roches and contains\r\nthe Grotte de Rabelais, so named in honour of the Cure of Meudon, when\r\nhe was presented at Rambouillet by the Cardinal du Bellay. It was on\r\nthis isle that were given those famous fetes in honour of the \"_beaux\r\nesprits_\" who formed the assiduous cortege of Catherine de Vivonne,\r\nmythological, pagan and _outre_.\r\n\r\nThe Jardin Anglais at Rambouillet is the final expression of the species\r\nin France. Designed under the Duc de Penthievre, it was restored and\r\nconsiderably enlarged by Napoleon and, following the contours of an\r\nartificial rivulet, it fulfils the description that its name implies.\r\n\r\nMore remote, and half hidden from the precincts of the chateau, are the\r\nChaumiere and the Ermitage and they recall the background of a Fragonard\r\nor a Watteau. It is all very \"stagy\"--but, since it exists, can hardly\r\nbe called unreal.\r\n\r\nThe park proper, containing more than twelve hundred hectares, is one of\r\nthe largest and most thickly wooded in France. Between the _parterre_\r\nand the French and English garden and the park lie the Farm and the\r\nLaiterie de la Reine, the caprice of Louis XVI when he would content\r\nMarie Antoinette and give her something to think about besides her\r\ntroubles. Napoleon stripped it of its furnishings to install them, for\r\na great part, at Malmaison, for that other unhappy woman--Josephine.\r\nLater, to give pleasure to Marie Louise, he ordered them brought back\r\nagain to Rambouillet, but it was to Napoleon III that the restoration of\r\nthis charming conceit was due.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Rambouillet was the famous Chateau de Chasse, or\r\nroyal shooting-box, which Louis XV was fond of making a place of\r\nrendezvous.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Etang de Pourras stood this Chateau de Saint Hubert,\r\nnamed for the patron saint of huntsmen, and within its walls was passed\r\nmany a happy evening by king and courtiers after a busy day with stag\r\nand hound.\r\n\r\nThe hunt in France was perhaps at the most picturesque phase of its\r\nexistence at this time. The hunt of to-day is but a pale, though bloody,\r\nimitation of the real sport of the days when monarchs and their\r\nseigneurs in slashed doublet and hose and velvet cloaks pursued the deer\r\nof the forest to his death, and knew not the _maitre d'equipage_ of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nCHANTILLY\r\n\r\n\r\nChantilly, because of its royal associations, properly finds its place\r\nin every traveller's French itinerary. Not only did Chantilly come to\r\nits great glory through royal favour, but in later years the French\r\ngovernment has taken it under its wing, the chateau, the stables and the\r\nvast park and forest, until the ensemble is to-day as much of a national\r\nshow place as Versailles or Saint Germain. It is here in the marble\r\nhalls, where once dwelt the Condes and the Montmorencys, that are held\r\neach year the examinations of the French Academie des Beaux Arts. And\r\nbesides this it is a place of pilgrimage for thousands of tourists who,\r\nas a class, for a couple of generations previously, never got farther\r\naway from the capital than Saint Cloud.\r\n\r\nMany charters of the tenth century make mention of the estates of\r\nChantilly, which at that time belonged to the Seigneurs of Senlis. The\r\nchateau was an evolution from a block-house, or fortress, erected by\r\nCatulus in Gallo-Roman times and four centuries later it remained\r\npractically of the same rank. In the fourteenth century the chateau was\r\nchiefly a vast fortress surrounded by a water defence in the form of an\r\nenlarged moat by means of which it was able to resist the Bourguignons\r\nand never actually fell until after the taking of Meaux by the English\r\nking, Henry V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHANTILLY]\r\n\r\nJean II de Montmorency, by his marriage with Marguerite d'Orgemont, came\r\nto be the possessor of the domain, their son, in turn, becoming the\r\nheir. It was this son, Guillaume, who became one of the most brilliant\r\nservitors of the monarchs Louis XI, Louis XII, and Francis I, and it was\r\nthrough these friends at court that Chantilly first took on its regal\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nIn turn the celebrated Anne de Montmorency, Connetable de France, came\r\ninto the succession and finding the old fortress, albeit somewhat\r\nenlarged and furbished up by his predecessor, less of a palatial\r\nresidence than he would have, separated the ancient chateau-fort from an\r\nadded structure by an ornamental moat, or canal, and laid out the\r\n_pelouse_, _parterres_ and the alleys of greensward leading to the\r\nforest which make one of the great charms of Chantilly to-day.\r\n\r\nHere resided, as visitors to be sure, but for more or less extended\r\nperiods, and at various times, Charles V, Charles IX and Henri IV, each\r\nof them guests of the hospitable and ambitious Montmorencys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Statue of Le Notre, Chantilly_]\r\n\r\nChantilly passed in 1632 to Charlotte, the sister of the last Marechal\r\nde Montmorency, the wife of Henri II, Prince de Conde, the mother of the\r\nGrand Conde, the Prince de Conti and the Duchesse de Longueville.\r\n\r\nWith the Grand Conde came the greatest fame, the apotheosis, of\r\nChantilly. This noble was so enamoured of this admirable residence that\r\nhe never left it from his thoughts and decorated it throughout in the\r\nmost lavish taste of his time, destroying at this epoch the chateau of\r\nthe moyen-age and the fortress. These were the days of gallant warriors\r\nwith a taste for pretty things in art, not mere bloodthirsty\r\nslaughterers.\r\n\r\nOn the foundations of the older structures there now rose an admirable\r\npile (not that which one sees to-day, however), embellished by the\r\nsurroundings which were evolved from the brain of the landscape\r\ngardener, Le Notre. The Revolution made way with this lavish structure\r\nand with the exception of the Chatelet, or the Petit Chateau (designed\r\nby Jean Bullant in 1560, and remodelled within by Mansart) the\r\npresent-day work is a creation of the Duc d'Aumale, the heir to the\r\nCondes' name and fame, to whom the National Assembly gave back his\r\nancestral estates which had in the meantime come into the inventory of\r\nroyal belongings through the claims established by the might of the\r\nSecond Empire.\r\n\r\nBack to the days of the Grand Conde one reads of an extended visit made\r\nby Louis XIV to his principal courtier. It was at an expense of two\r\nhundred thousand _ecus_ that the welcoming fete was accomplished. Madame\r\nde Sevigne has recounted the event more graphically than any other\r\nchronicler, and it would be presumption to review it here at length. The\r\nincident of Vatel alone has become classic.\r\n\r\nTo the coterie of poets at Rambouillet must be added those of Chantilly;\r\ntheir sojourn here added much of moment to the careers and reputations\r\nof Boileau, Racine, Bourdaloue and Bossuet. It was the latter, who, in\r\nthe funeral oration which he delivered on the death of the Prince de\r\nConde, said:\r\n\r\n\"Here under his own roof one saw the Grand Conde as if he were at the\r\nhead of his armies, a noble always great, as well in action as in\r\nrepose. Here you have seen him surrounded by his friends in this\r\nmagnificent dwelling, in the shady alleys of the forest or beside the\r\npurling waters of the brooks which are silent neither day nor night.\"\r\n\r\nThe Grand Conde died, however, at Fontainebleau. The heir, Henri-Jules\r\nde Bourbon, did his share towards keeping up and embellishing the\r\nproperty, and to him was due that charming wildwood retreat known as the\r\nParc de Sylvie.\r\n\r\nLouis-Henri de Bourbon, Minister of Louis XV at the commencement of his\r\nreign, had gained a fabulous sum of money in the notorious \"Law's Bank\"\r\naffair, and, with a profligate and prodigal taste in spending, lived a\r\nlife of the grandest of grand seigneurs at Chantilly, to which, as his\r\ndonation to its architectural importance, he contributed the famous\r\nEcuries, or stables. To show that he was _persona grata_ at court he\r\ngave a great fete here for Louis XV and the Duchesse du Barry.\r\n\r\nThe last Prince de Conde but one before the Revolution built the Chateau\r\nd'Enghien in the neighbourhood, and sought to people the Parc de Sylvie\r\nwith a rustic colony of thatched _maisonettes_ and install his\r\nfavourites therein in a weak imitation of what had been done in the\r\nPetit Trianon. The note was manifestly a false one and did not endure,\r\nnot even is its echo plainly audible for all is hearsay to-day and no\r\nvery definite record of the circumstance exists.\r\n\r\nChantilly in later times has been a favourite abode with modern\r\nmonarchs. The King of Denmark, the Emperor Joseph II and the King of\r\nSweden were given hospitality here, and much money was spent for their\r\nentertainment, and much red and green fire burned for their amusement\r\nand that of their suites.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution's fell blow carried off the principal parts of the\r\nConde's admirable constructions and it is fortunate that the Petit\r\nChateau escaped the talons of the \"Bande Noire.\" Immediately afterwards\r\nthe Chateau d'Enghien and the Ecuries were turned over to the uses of\r\nthe Minister of War, and the authorities of the Jardin des Plantes were\r\ngiven permission to transplant and transport anything which pleased\r\ntheir fancy among the exotics which had been set out by Le Notre in\r\nChantilly's famous _parterres_.\r\n\r\nUnder the imperial regime the Foret de Chantilly was given in fee simple\r\nto Queen Hortense, though all was ultimately returned to the Conde heirs\r\nafter the Restoration. It was at this period that Chantilly received the\r\nvisit of Alexander, Emperor of Russia, and the historian's account of\r\nthat visit makes prominent the fact that during the periods of rain it\r\nwas necessary that an umbrella be carried over the imperial head as he\r\npassed through the corridors of the palace from one apartment to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe host of the emperor died here in 1818 and his son, spending perhaps\r\nhalf of his time here, cared little for restoration and spent all his\r\nwaking hours hunting in the forest, returning to the Petit Chateau only\r\nto eat and sleep.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Bourbon added to the flanking wings of the Petit Chateau and\r\ncleaned up the debris which was fast becoming moss-grown, weed\r\nencumbered and altogether disgraceful. The moats were cleaned out of\r\ntheir miasmatic growth and certain of the grass-carpeted _parterres_\r\nresown and given a semblance of their former selves.\r\n\r\nSome days after the Revolution of 1830 the Prince de Conde died in a\r\nmost dramatic fashion, and his son, the Duc d'Enghien, having been shot\r\nat Vincennes under the Empire, he willed the Duc d'Aumale and his issue\r\nhis legal descendants forever.\r\n\r\nTowards 1840 the Duc d'Aumale sought to reconstruct the splendours of\r\nChantilly, but a decree of January 22, 1852, banished the entire Orleans\r\nfamily and interrupted the work when the property was sold to the\r\nEnglish bankers, Coutts and Company, for the good round sum of eleven\r\nmillion francs, not by any means an extravagant price for this estate\r\nof royal aspect and proportions. The National Assembly of 1872 did the\r\nonly thing it could do in justice to tradition--bought the property in\r\nand decreed that it be restored to its legitimate proprietor.\r\n\r\nIt was as late as 1876 that the Duc d'Aumale undertook the restoration\r\nof the Chatelet and the rebuilding of the new chateau which is seen\r\nto-day. The latter is from the designs of Henri Daumet, member of the\r\nInstitut de France.\r\n\r\nIn general the structure of to-day occupies the site of the moyen-age\r\nchateau but is of quite a different aspect.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Aumale made a present of the chateau and all that was\r\ncontained therein to the Institut de France. From a purely sordid point\r\nof view it was a gift valued at something like thirty-five million\r\nfrancs, not so great as many new-world public legacies of to-day, but in\r\ncertain respects of a great deal more artistic worth.\r\n\r\nThe mass is manifestly imposing, made up as it is, of four distinct\r\nparts, the Eglise, dating from 1692, the Ecuries, the Chatelet--or Petit\r\nChateau, and the Chateau proper--the modern edifice.\r\n\r\nBefore the celebrated Ecuries is a green, velvety _pelouse_ which gives\r\nan admirable approach. The architecture of the Ecuries is of a heavy\r\norder and the sculptured decorations actually of little esthetic worth,\r\nrepresenting as they do hunting trophies and the like. Before the great\r\nfountain one deciphers a graven plaque which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n   Louis Henri de Bourbon\r\n   Prince de Conde\r\n   Fut Construire Cette Ecurie\r\n   1701-1784.\r\n\r\nWithin the two wings may be stabled nearly two hundred horses. The Grand\r\nEcuries at Chantilly are assuredly one of the finest examples extant of\r\nthat luxuriant art of the eighteenth century French builder. Luxurious,\r\nexcessively ornate and overpowering it is, and, for that reason, open to\r\nquestion. The work of the period knew not the discreet middle road. It\r\nwas of Chantilly that it was said that the live stock was better lodged\r\nthan its masters. The architect of this portion of the chateau was Jean\r\nAubert, one of the collaborators of Jules Hardouin Mansart.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of Chantilly, take it as a whole, the chateau, the\r\npark and the forest, are chiefly theatrical, but with an all-abiding\r\nregard for the proprieties, for beyond a certain heaviness of\r\narchitectural style in parts of the chateau everything is of the finely\r\nfocussed relative order of which the French architect and landscape\r\ngardener have for ages been past masters.\r\n\r\nThe real French garden is here to be seen almost at its best, its\r\nsquares and ovals of grassy green apportioned off from the mass by\r\ngravelled walks and ornamented waters. The \"_tapis d'orient_\" effect, so\r\nfrequently quoted by the French in writing of such works, is hardly\r\nexcelled elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAll this shocked the mid-eighteenth century English traveller, but it\r\nwas because he did not, perhaps could not, understand. Rigby, \"the\r\nNorwich alderman\" as the French rather contemptuously referred to this\r\nfine old English gentleman, said frankly of Chantilly: \"All this has\r\ncost dear and produced a result far from pleasing.\" He would have been\r\nbetter pleased doubtless with a privet or box hedge and an imitation\r\nplaster rockery, things which have never agreed with French taste, but\r\nwhich were the rule in pretentious English gardens of the same period.\r\nRigby must indeed have been a \"_grincheau_,\" as the French called him,\r\nfor this same up-country gentleman said of Versailles: \"Lovely\r\nsurrounding country but palace and park badly designed.\" Versailles is\r\nnot that, whatever else its faults may be.\r\n\r\nChantilly is more than a palace, it is a museum of nature, a hermitage\r\nof art and of history. The fantasy of its _tourelles_, its _lucarnes_\r\nand its _pignons_ are something one may hardly see elsewhere in such\r\nprofusion, and the fact that they are modern is forgotten in the\r\nimpression of the general silhouette.\r\n\r\nThe adventurer who first built a donjon on the Rocher de Chantilly\r\nlittle knew with what seigneurial splendour the site was ultimately to\r\nbe graced. From a bare outpost it was transformed, as if by magic, into\r\na Renaissance palace of a supreme beauty. The Duc d'Aumale said in his\r\n\"Acte de Donation de Chantilly\": \"It stands complete and varied, a\r\nmonument of French art in all its branches, a history of the best epochs\r\nof our glory.\"\r\n\r\nAmong all the palatial riches neighbouring upon Paris, not forgetting\r\nVersailles, Compiegne, Fontainebleau, Pierrefonds and Rambouillet,\r\nChantilly, by the remarkable splendour of its surroundings, its\r\nsituation and the artistic treasures which it possesses, is in a class\r\nby itself. It is a class more clearly defined by the historic souvenirs\r\nwhich surround it than any other contemporary structure of this part of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIts corridors and gravelled walks and the long alleys of the park and\r\nforest may not take on the fete-like aspect which they knew in the\r\neighteenth century, but they are not solitary like those of\r\nFontainebleau and Rambouillet, nor noisily overrun like those of\r\nVersailles or Saint Germain.\r\n\r\nThe ornamental waters which surround the Chateau de Chantilly are of a\r\ngrand and nearly unique beauty. It is a question if they are not finer\r\nthan the waters of Versailles, indeed they preceded them and may even\r\nhave inspired them.\r\n\r\nThe Chatelet, the chateau proper and the chapel form a group quite\r\ndistinct from the Ecuries. The Cour d'Honneur is really splendid and one\r\nhardly realizes the juxtaposition of modernity. The pavilion attributed\r\nto Jean Bullant, the western facade, the ancient Petit Chateau, the\r\nGrand Vestibule, the Grand Escalier and the Gallerie des Cerfs and a\r\ndozen other apartments are of a rare and imposing beauty, though losing\r\nsomewhat their distinctive aspect by reason of the _objets de musee_\r\ndistributed about their walls and floors.\r\n\r\nOne of the landscape gems of Chantilly is the _Pelouse_, a vast\r\nesplanade of greensward now forming, in part, the celebrated race track\r\nof Chantilly. Sport ever formed a part of the outdoor program at\r\nChantilly, but that of to-day is just a bit more horsey than that of\r\nold, a good deal less picturesque and assuredly more vulgarly banal as\r\nto its _cachet_ than the hunts, the tourneys and courses of the romantic\r\nage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chateau de Chantilly_]\r\n\r\nThousands come to Chantilly to wager their coin on scrubs and dark\r\nhorses ridden by third-rate \"warned-off\" jockeys from other lands, but\r\nprobably not ten in ten thousand of the lookers on at the Grand Prix du\r\nJockey Club in May ever make the occasion of the spring meeting an\r\nopportunity for visiting the fine old historic monument of the Condes.\r\n\r\nThe \"Races\" of Chantilly may be given a further word in that they are an\r\noutgrowth of a foundation by the Duc d'Orleans in 1832. The track forms\r\na circuit of two thousand metres, and occupies quite the best half of\r\nthe Pelouse, closed in on one side by the thick-grown Foret de Chantilly\r\nand flanked, in part, on the other by the historic Ecuries, with the\r\nTribune, or grand stand, just to the south.\r\n\r\nMany tourists arrive at Chantilly by auto, stop brusquely before the\r\nGrande Grille, rush through the galleries of the chateau, do \"_cent\r\npas_\" in the park, give a cursory glance at the stables and are off; but\r\nmore, many more, with slower steps and saner minds, drink in the charms\r\nwhich are offered on all sides and consider the time well spent even if\r\nthey have paid \"Boulevard Prices\" at the Restaurant du Grand Conde for\r\ntheir _dejeuner_.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that a museum is a reunion of _objets d'art_ brought\r\nabout by a methodical grouping, either chronologically or categorically.\r\nThe Duc d'Aumale's Musee de Chantilly is more an expression of personal\r\ntaste. He collected what he wished and he arranged his collections as\r\nsuited his fancy.\r\n\r\nThe famous Musee de Chantilly, which is the lodestone which draws most\r\nfolk thither, so admirably housed, was a gift of the Duc d'Aumale who,\r\nfor the glory of his ancestors, and the admiration of the world, to say\r\nnothing of his own personal satisfaction, here gathered together an\r\neclectic collection of curious and artistic treasures, certainly not the\r\nleast interesting or valuable among the great public collections in\r\nFrance. The effect produced is sometimes startling, a Messonier is cheek\r\nby jowl with a Baron Gros, a Decamps _vis a vis_ to a Veronese, and a\r\nLancret is bolstered on either hand by a Poussin and a Nattier. Amid all\r\nthis disorder there is, however, an undeniable, inexplicable charm.\r\n\r\nThere are three distinct apartments worth, more than all the others, the\r\nglance of the hurried visitor to the Musee Conde at Chantilly. In the\r\nfirst, the Santuario, is the Livre d'Heures of Etienne Chevalier, by\r\nJean Fouquet, considered as the most important relic of primitive French\r\nart extant.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet des Gemmes comes second, and here is the celebrated \"Diamant\r\nRose,\" called the Grand Conde.\r\n\r\nFinally there is the Galerie de Psyche, with forty-four coloured glass\r\nwindows, executed for the Connetable de Montmorency in 1541-1542.\r\n\r\nThe great collection of historical and artistic treasures stowed away\r\nwithin the walls of Chantilly the Duc d'Aumale selected himself in order\r\nto associate his own name with the glorious memory of the Condes, who\r\nwere so intimately connected with the chateau.\r\n\r\nThe Duc sought to recover such of the former furnishings of the chateau\r\nas had been dissipated during the Revolution whenever they could be\r\nheard of and could be had at public or private sale.\r\n\r\nIn this connection a word on Chantilly lace may not be found inapropos.\r\nThe Chantilly lace of to-day, it is well to recall, is a mechanically\r\nproduced article of commerce, turned out by the running mile from\r\nNottingham, England, though in the days when Chantilly's porcelains\r\nrivalled those of Sevres it was purely a local product. One may well\r\nargue therefore that the bulk of the Chantilly lace sold in the shops of\r\nChantilly to-day is not on a par with the admirable examples to be seen\r\nin the glass cases of the museum.\r\n\r\nA wooded alley leading to the great park runs between the main edifice\r\nand the Chateau d'Enghien, a gentle incline descending again to the\r\nsunken gardens in a monumental stairway of easy slope, the whole a\r\nquintessence of much that is best of the art of the landscape gardener\r\nof the time.\r\n\r\nTo the left extends the vast Jardin Anglais--a veritable French Jardin\r\nAnglais. Let not one overlook the distinction: On conventional lines it\r\nis pretty, dainty and pleasing, but the species lacks the dignified\r\nformality of the Italian garden or the ingenious arrangement of the\r\nFrench. Its curves and ovals and circles are annoying after the _lignes\r\ndroites_ and the right angles and the _broderies_ of the French variety.\r\n\r\nThe Foret de Chantilly covers two thousand four hundred and forty-nine\r\nhectares and extends from the Bois de Herivaux on one side to the Foret\r\nde Senlis on the other. The _rendezvous-de-chasse_ was, in the old days,\r\nand is to-day on rare occasions, at the Rond Point, to which a dozen\r\nmagnificent forest roads lead from all directions, that from the town\r\nbeing paved with Belgian blocks, the dread of automobilists, but\r\ndelightful to ride over in muddy weather. The Route de Connetable, so\r\ncalled, is well-nigh ideal of its kind. It launches forth opposite the\r\nchateau and at its entrance are two flanking stone lions. It is of a\r\nsoft soil suitable for horseback riding, but entirely unsuited for\r\nwheeled traffic of any kind.\r\n\r\nAnother of the great forest roads leads to the Chateau de la Reine\r\nBlanche, a diminutive edifice in the pointed style, with a pair of\r\nsvelte towers coiffed candle-snuffer fashion. Tradition, and very\r\nancient and somewhat dubious tradition, attributes the edifice as having\r\nbelonged to Blanche de Navarre, the wife of Philippe de Valois. Again it\r\nis thought to have been a sort of royal attachment to the Abbaye de\r\nRoyaumont, built near by, by Saint Louis. This quaintly charming manor\r\nof minute dimensions was a tangible, habitable abode in 1333, but for\r\ngenerations after appears to have fallen into desuetude. A mill grew up\r\non the site, and again the walls of a chateau obliterated the more\r\nmundane, work-a-day mill. The Duc de Bourbon restored the whole place in\r\n1826 that it might serve him and his noble friends as a hunting-lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nCOMPIEGNE AND ITS FOREST\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most talked of and the least visited of the minor French\r\npalaces is that of Compiegne. The archeologists coming to Compiegne\r\nfirst notice that all its churches are \"_malorientees_.\" It is a minor\r\npoint with most folk, but when one notes that its five churches have\r\ntheir high altars turned to all points of the compass, instead of to the\r\neast, it is assuredly a fact to be noticed, even if one is more\r\nromantically inclined than devout.\r\n\r\nThrough and through, Compiegne, its palace, its hotel-de-ville, its\r\nforest, is delightful. Old and new huddle close together, and the _art\r\nnouveau_ decorations of a branch of a great Parisian department store\r\nflank a butcher's stall which looks as though it might have come down\r\nfrom the times when all trading was done in the open air.\r\n\r\nCompiegne's origin goes back to the antique. It was originally\r\nCompendium, a Roman station situated on the highway between Soissons and\r\nBeauvais. A square tower, Caesar's Tower, gave a military aspect to the\r\nwalled and fortified station, and evidences are not wanting to-day to\r\nsuggest with what strength its fortifications were endowed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Compiegne]\r\n\r\nIt was here that the first Frankish kings built their dwelling, and here\r\nthat Pepin-le-Bref received the gracious gift of an organ from the\r\nEmperor Constantine, and here, in 833, that an assembly of bishops and\r\nnobles deposed Louis-le-Debonnaire.\r\n\r\nCharles-le-Chauve received Pope Jean VIII in great pomp in the palace at\r\nCompiegne, and it was this Pope who gave absolution to Louis-le-Begue,\r\nwho died here but a year after, 879. The last of the Carlovingians,\r\nLouis V (le-Faineant), died also at Compiegne in 987.\r\n\r\nThe city is thus shown to have been a favourite place of sojourn for the\r\nkings of the Franks, and those of the first and second races. As was but\r\nobvious many churchly councils were held here, fourteen were recorded in\r\nfive centuries, but none of great ecclesiastical or civil purport.\r\n\r\nThe city first got its charter in 1153, but the Merovingian city having\r\nfallen into a sort of galloping decay Saint Louis gave it to the\r\nDominicans in 1260, who here founded, by the orders of the king, a Hotel\r\nDieu which, in part, is the same edifice which performs its original\r\nfunctions to-day.\r\n\r\nThe first great love of Compiegne was expressed by Charles V, who\r\nrebuilt the palace of Charles-le-Chauve in a manner which was far from\r\nmaking it a monumental or artistically disposed edifice. It was\r\noriginally called the Louvre, from the Latin word _opus_\r\n(_l'oeuvre_), a word which was applied to all the chateaux-forts of\r\nthese parts. The same monarch did better with the country-houses which\r\nhe afterwards built at Saint Germain and Vincennes; perhaps by this time\r\nhe had grown wise in his dealings with architects.\r\n\r\nLike all the little towns of the Valois, Compiegne abounds in souvenirs\r\nof the Guerre de Cent Ans, Jeanne d'Arc, Louis XIV, Louis XV, Napoleon I\r\nand Napoleon III, and as its monuments attest this glory, so its forest,\r\none of the finest in France, awakens almost as many historical memories.\r\n\r\nWars and rumors of war kept Compiegne in a turmoil for centuries, but\r\nthe most theatrical episode was the famous \"_sortie_\" made by Jeanne\r\nd'Arc when she was attempting to defend the city against the combined\r\nEnglish and Burgundian troops. It was an episode in which faint heart,\r\nperhaps treason, played an unwelcome part, for while the gallant maid\r\nwas taking all manner of chances outside the gates the military\r\ngovernor, Guillaume de Flavy, ordered the barriers of the great portal\r\nclosed behind her and her men.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the Pont de Saint Louis Jeanne d'Arc fell into the hands\r\nof the besiegers. An archer from Picardy captured her single handed,\r\nand, for a round sum in silver or in kind, turned her over to her\r\ntorturer, Jean de Luxembourg. A statue of the maid is found on the\r\npublic \"Place,\" and the Tour Jeanne d'Arc, a great circular donjon of\r\nthe thirteenth century, is near by. Another souvenir is to be found in\r\nthe ancient Hotel de Boeuf, at No. 9 Rue de Paris, where the maid\r\nlodged from the eighteenth to the twenty-third of August, 1429, awaiting\r\nthe entry of Charles VII.\r\n\r\nWith the era of Francis I that gallant and fastidious monarch came to\r\ntake up his residence at Compiegne. He here received his \"friend and\r\nenemy,\" Charles V, but strangely enough there is no monument in\r\nCompiegne to-day which is intimately associated with the stay here of\r\nthe art-loving Francis. He preferred, after all, his royal manor at\r\nVillers-Cotterets near by. There was more privacy there, and it formed\r\nan admirable retreat for such moments when the king did not wish to bask\r\nin publicity, and these moments were many, though one might not at first\r\nthink so when reading of his affairs of state. There were also affairs\r\nof the heart which, to him, in many instances, were quite as important.\r\nThis should not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn 1624 a treaty was signed at Compiegne which assured the alliance of\r\nLouis XIII with the United Provinces, and during this reign the court\r\nwas frequently in residence here. In 1631 Marie de Medici, then a\r\nprisoner in the palace, made a notable escape and fled, doomed ever\r\nafterwards to a vagabond existence, a terrible fall for her once proud\r\nglory, to her death in a Cologne garret ten years later.\r\n\r\nIn 1635 the Grand Chancellor of Sweden signed a treaty here which\r\nenabled France to mingle in the affairs of the Thirty Years' War.\r\n\r\nDuring the Fronde, that \"Woman's War,\" which was so entirely\r\nunnecessary, Anne d'Autriche held her court in the Palace of Compiegne\r\nand received Christine de Suede on certain occasions when that royal\r\nlady's costume was of such a grotesque nature, and her speech so\r\n_chevaleresque_, that she caused even a scandal in a profligate court.\r\nAnne d'Autriche, too, left Compiegne practically a prisoner; another\r\n_menage a trois_ had been broken up.\r\n\r\nThe most imposing event in the history of Compiegne of which the\r\nchronicles tell was the assembling of sixty thousand men beneath the\r\nwalls by Louis XIV, in order to give Madame de Maintenon a realistic\r\nexhibition of \"playing soldiers.\" At all events the demonstration was a\r\nbloodless one, and an immortal page in Saint-Simon's \"Memoires\"\r\nconsecrates this gallantry of a king in a most subtle manner.\r\n\r\nAnother fair lady, a royal favourite, too, came on the scene at\r\nCompiegne in 1769 when Madame du Barry was the principal _artiste_ in\r\nthe great fete given in her honour by Louis XV. She was lodged in a tiny\r\nchateau (built originally for Madame de Pompadour) a short way out of\r\ntown on the Soissons road.\r\n\r\nDu Barry must have been a good fairy to Compiegne for Louis XV lavished\r\nan abounding care on the chateau and, rather than allow the architect,\r\nJacques Ange Gabriel, have the free hand that his counsellors advised,\r\nsought to have the ancient outlines of the former structure on the site\r\npreserved and thus present to posterity through the newer work the two\r\nmonumental facades which are to be seen to-day. The effort was not\r\nwholly successful, for the architect actually did carry out his fancy\r\nwith respect to the decoration in the same manner in which he had\r\ndesigned the Ecole Militaire at Paris and the two colonnaded edifices\r\nfacing upon the Place de la Concorde.\r\n\r\nThis work was entirely achieved when Louis XVI took possession. This\r\nmonarch, in 1780, caused to be fitted up a most elaborate apartment for\r\nthe queen (his marriage with Marie Antoinette was consecrated here), but\r\nthat indeed was all the hand he had in the work of building at\r\nCompiegne, which has practically endured as his predecessor left it. The\r\nRevolution and Consulate used the chateau as their fancy willed, and\r\nrather harshly, but in 1806 its restoration was begun and Charles IV of\r\nSpain, upon his dethronement by Napoleon, was installed therein a couple\r\nof years later.\r\n\r\nThe palace, the park and the forest now became a sort of royal appanage\r\nof this Spanish monarch, which Napoleon, in a generous spirit, could\r\nwell afford to will him. He lived here some months and then left\r\nprecipitately for Marseilles.\r\n\r\nNapoleon affected a certain regard for this palatial property, though\r\nonly occupying it at odd moments. He embellished its surroundings, above\r\nall its gardens, in a most lavish manner. Virtually, all things\r\nconsidered, Compiegne is a _Palais Napoleonien_, and if one would study\r\nthe style of the Empire at its best the thing may be done at Compiegne.\r\n\r\nOn July 30, 1814, Louis XVIII and Alexander of Russia met at Compiegne\r\namid a throng of Paris notabilities who had come thither for the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nCharles X loved to hunt in the forest of Compiegne. In 1832, one of the\r\ndaughters of Louis-Philippe, the Princesse Louise, was married to the\r\nKing of the Belgians in this palace.\r\n\r\nFrom 1852 to 1870 the palace and its grounds were the scenes of many\r\nimperial fetes.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III had for Compiegne a particular predilection. The\r\nprince-president, in 1852, installed himself here for the autumn season,\r\nand among his guests was that exquisite blond beauty, Eugenie Montijo,\r\nwho, the year after, was to become the empress of the French. Faithful\r\nto the memory of his uncle, by reason of a romantic sentiment, the Third\r\nNapoleon came frequently to Compiegne; or perhaps it was because of the\r\nnear-by hunt, for he was a passionate disciple of Saint Hubert. It was\r\nhis Versailles!\r\n\r\nThe palace of Compiegne as seen to-day presents all the classic coldness\r\nof construction of the reign of Louis XV. Its lines were severe and that\r\nthe building was inspired by a genius is hard to believe, though in\r\ngeneral it is undeniably impressive. Frankly, it is a mocking, decadent\r\neighteenth century architecture that presents itself, but of such vast\r\nproportions that one sets it down as something grand if not actually of\r\nsurpassing good taste.\r\n\r\nIn general the architecture of the palace presents at first glance a\r\ncoherent unit, though in reality it is of several epochs. Its\r\nfurnishings within are of different styles and periods, not all of them\r\nof the best. Slender gold chairs, false reproductions of those of the\r\ntime of Louis XV, and some deplorable tapestries huddle close upon\r\nelegant \"_bergeres_\" of Louis XVI, and sofas, tables and bronzes of\r\nmaster artists and craftsmen are mingled with cheap castings unworthy of\r\na stage setting in a music hall. A process of adroit eviction will some\r\nday be necessary to bring these furnishings up to a consistent plane of\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nOne of the facades is nearly six hundred feet in length, with forty-nine\r\nwindows stretching out in a single range. It might be the front of an\r\nautomobile factory if it were less ornate, or that of an exposition\r\nbuilding were it more beautiful. In some respects it is reminiscent of\r\nthe Palais Royal at Paris, particularly as to the entrance colonnade and\r\ngallery facing the Louvre.\r\n\r\nThe chief beauty within is undoubtedly the magnificent stairway, with\r\nits balustrade of wrought iron of the period of Louis XVI. The Salle de\r\nSpectacle is of a certain Third Empire-Louis Napoleon distinction, which\r\nis saying that it is neither very lovely nor particularly plain, simply\r\nordinary, or, to give it a French turn of phrase, vulgar.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable apartments is the Salle des Cartes, the old\r\nsalon of the Aides de Camp, whose walls are ornamented with three great\r\nplans showing the roads and by-paths of the forest, and other decorative\r\npanels representing the hunt of the time of Louis XV.\r\n\r\nThe Chambre a Coucher of the great Napoleon is perhaps the most\r\ninteresting of all the smaller apartments, with its strange bed, which\r\nin form more nearly resembles an oriental divan than anything European.\r\nDoubtless it is not uncomfortable as a bed, but it looks more like a\r\ntent, or camp, in the open, than anything essentially intended for\r\ndomestic use within doors. After the great Napoleon, his nephew Napoleon\r\nIII was its most notable occupant, though it was last slept in by the\r\nTzar Nicholas II, when he visited France in 1901.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping-room of the Empress Eugenie is fitted up after the style of\r\nthe early Empire with certain interpolations of the mid-nineteenth\r\ncentury. The most distinct feature here is the battery of linen coffers\r\nwhich Marie Louise had had especially designed and built. The Salon des\r\nDames d'Honneur, with its double rank of nine \"scissors chairs,\" the\r\nfamous _tabourets de cour_, lined up rigidly before the _canape_ on\r\nwhich the empress rested, is certainly a remarkable apartment. This\r\nwas the _decor_ of convention that Madame Sans Gene rendered classic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Napoleon's Bedchamber, Compiegne_]\r\n\r\nLike all the French national palaces Compiegne has a too abundant\r\ncollection of Sevres vases set about in awkward corners which could not\r\notherwise be filled, and, beginning with the vestibule, this thing is\r\npainfully apparent.\r\n\r\nThe apartments showing best the Napoleonic style in decorations and\r\nfurnishings are the Salon des Huissiers, the Salle des Gardes, the\r\nEscalier d'Apollon, the Salle de Don Quichotte--which contains a series\r\nof designs destined to have served for a series of tapestries intended\r\nto depict scenes in the life of the windmill knight--the Galerie des\r\nFetes, the Galerie des Cerfs, the Salle Coypel, the Salle des Stucs and\r\nthe Salon des Fleurs, through which latter one approaches the royal\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, or, more exactly, between 1502 and 1510, was\r\nconstructed Compiegne's handsome Hotel de Ville, one of the most\r\ndelightful architectural mixtures of Gothic and Renaissance extant. It\r\nis an architectural monument of the same class as the Palais de Justice\r\nat Rouen or the Hotel Cluny at Paris. Its frontispiece is marvellous,\r\nthe _rez-de-chaussee_ less gracious than the rest perhaps, but with the\r\nfirst story blooming forth as a gem of magnificent proportions and\r\nsetting. Between the four windows of this first story are posed\r\nstatuesque effigies of Charles VII, Jeanne d'Arc, Saint Remy and Louis\r\nIX. In the centre, in a niche, is an equestrian statue of Louis XII, who\r\nreigned when this monument was being built. A _balustrade a jour_\r\nfinishes off this story, which, in turn, is overhung with a high, peaked\r\ngable, and above rise the belfry and its spire, of which the great clock\r\ndates from 1303, though only put into place in 1536. The only false note\r\nis sounded by the two insignificant, cold and unlovely wings which flank\r\nthe main structure on either side.\r\n\r\nIt is a sixteenth century construction unrivalled of its kind in all\r\nFrance, more like a Belgian town-hall belfry than anything elsewhere to\r\nbe seen outside Flanders, but it is not of the low Spanish-Renaissance\r\norder as are so many of the imposing edifices of occidental and oriental\r\nFlanders. It is a blend of Gothic and Renaissance, and, what is still\r\nmore rare, the best of Gothic and the best of Renaissance. Above its\r\nfacade is a civic belfry, flanked by two slender towers. Within the\r\nportal-vestibule rises a monumental stairway which must have been the\r\ninspiration of many a builder of modern opera-houses.\r\n\r\nOpposite the Hotel Dieu is the poor, rent relic of the Tour de Jeanne\r\nd'Arc, originally a cylindrical donjon of the twelfth century, wherein\r\n\"La Pucelle\" was imprisoned in 1430.\r\n\r\nBetween the palace and the river are to be seen many vestiges of the\r\nmediaeval ramparts of the town, and here and there a well-defined base of\r\na gateway or tower. Mediaevalism is rampant throughout Compiegne.\r\n\r\nThe park surrounding the palace is quite distinct from the wider radius\r\nof the Foret de Compiegne. It is of the secular, conventional order, and\r\nits perspectives, looking towards the forest from the terrace and vice\r\nversa, are in all ways satisfying to the eye.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking of these alleyed vistas was laid out under the\r\norders of the first Napoleon in 1810. It loses itself in infinity,\r\nalmost, its horizon blending with that of the far distant Beaux Monts in\r\nthe heart of the forest.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of the palace are innumerable statues,\r\nnone of great beauty, value or distinction. On the south side runs a\r\nCours, or Prado, as it would be called in Catalonia. The word Cours is\r\nof Provencal origin, and how it ever came to be transplanted here is a\r\nmystery. Still here it is, a great tree-shaded promenade running to the\r\nriver. The climate of Compiegne is never so blazing hot as to make this\r\nCours so highly appreciated as its namesakes in the Midi, but as an\r\nexotic accessory to the park it is quite a unique delight.\r\n\r\nWithin the park may still be traced the outlines of the moat which\r\nsurrounded the palace of Charles V, as well as some scanty remains of\r\nthe same period.\r\n\r\nAnother distinctive feature is the famous _Berceau en Fer_, an iron\r\ntrellis several thousands of feet in length, which was built by Napoleon\r\nI as a reminder to Marie Louise of a similar, but smaller, garden\r\naccessory which she had known at Schoenbrunn. It was a caprice, if you\r\nlike, and rather a futile one since it was before the time when\r\nartistically worthless things were the rage just because of their\r\ngigantic proportions. Napoleon III cut it down in part, and pruned it to\r\nmore esthetic proportions, and what there is left, vine and flower\r\ngrown, is really charming.\r\n\r\nThe Foret de Compiegne as a historic wildwood goes back to the Druids\r\nwho practiced their mysterious rites under its antique shade centuries\r\nbefore the coming of the kings, who later called it their own special\r\nhunting preserve. Stone hatchets, not unlike the tomahawks of the red\r\nman, have been found and traced back--well, definitely to the Stone\r\nAge, and supposedly to the time when they served the Druids for their\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cours de Compiegne_]\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of Caesar came later and their axes were of iron or copper,\r\nand though on the warpath, too, their way was one which was supposed to\r\nlead civilization into the wilderness. Innumerable traces of the Roman\r\noccupation are to be found in the forest by those who know how to read\r\nthe signs; twenty-five different localities have been marked down by the\r\narcheologists as having been stations on the path blazed by the Legions\r\nof Rome.\r\n\r\nAfter the Romans came the first of the kings as proprietors of the\r\nforest, and in the moyen-age the monks, the barons and the crown itself\r\nshared equally the rights of the forest.\r\n\r\nLegends of most weird purport are connected with various points\r\nscattered here and there throughout the forest, as at the Fosse Dupuis\r\nand the Table Ronde, where a sort of \"trial by fire\" was held by the\r\nbarons whenever a seigneur among them had conspired against another.\r\nAriosto, gathering many of his legends from the works of the old French\r\nchroniclers, did not disdain to make use of the Foret de Compiegne as a\r\nstage setting.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Clothaire the forest was known as the Foret de\r\nCuise, because of a royal palace hidden away among the Druid oaks which\r\nbore the name of Cotia, or Cusia. Until 1346 the palace existed in some\r\nform or other, though shorn of royal dignities. It was at this period\r\nthat Philippe VI divided the forests of the Valois into three distinct\r\nparts in order to better regulate their exploitation.\r\n\r\nThe Frankish kings being, it would seem, inordinately fond of _la\r\nchasse_ the Foret de Compiegne, in the spring and autumn, became their\r\nfavorite rendezvous. Alcuin, the historian, noted this fact in the\r\neighth century, and described this earliest of royal hunts in some\r\ndetail. In 715 the forest was the witness of a great battle between the\r\nAustrasians and the Neustrians.\r\n\r\nBefore Francis I with his habitual initiative had pierced the eight\r\ngreat forest roads which come together at the octagon called the Puits\r\ndu Roi, the forest was not crossed by any thoroughfare; the nearest\r\nthing thereto was the Chaussee de Brunhaut, a Roman way which bounded it\r\non the south and east.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV and Louis XV, in turn, cut numerous roads and paths, and to\r\nthe latter were due the crossroads known as the Grand Octagone and the\r\nPetit Octagone.\r\n\r\nIt was over one of these great forest roads, that leading to Soissons,\r\nthat Marie Louise, accompanied by a cortege of three hundred persons,\r\neighty conveyances and four hundred and fifty horses, journeyed in a\r\ntorrential rain, in March 1807, when she came to France to found a\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\nA marriage had been consummated by procuration at Vienna, and she set\r\nout to actually meet her future spouse for the first time at Soissons.\r\nAt the little village of Courcelles, on the edge of the forest between\r\nSoissons and Compiegne, two men enveloped in great protecting cloaks had\r\narrived post-haste from Compiegne. At the parish church they stopped a\r\nmoment and took shelter under the porch, impatiently scanning the\r\nhorizon. Finally a lumbering _berlin de voyage_ lurched into view, drawn\r\nby eight white horses. In its depths were ensconced two women richly\r\ndressed, one a beautiful woman of mature years, the other a young girl\r\nscarce eighteen years.\r\n\r\nThe most agitated of the men, he who was clad in a gray redingote,\r\nsprang hastily to the carriage door. He was introduced by the older\r\nwoman as \"_Sa Majeste l'Empereur des Francaises, mon frere_.\" The\r\nspeaker was one of the sisters of Napoleon, Caroline, Queen of Naples;\r\nthe other was the Archduchess Marie Louise, daughter of Franz II,\r\nEmperor of Austria.\r\n\r\nAn imposing ceremonial had been planned for Soissons and the court had\r\nbeen ordered to set out from Compiegne with the emperor, in order to\r\narrive at Soissons in due time. When the actual signal for the departure\r\nwas given the emperor was nowhere to be found. As usual he had\r\nanticipated things.\r\n\r\nFor weeks before the arrival of the empress to be Napoleon had passed\r\nthe majority of his waking hours at Paris in the apartments which he had\r\ncaused to be prepared for Marie Louise. He selected the colour of the\r\nfurnishings, and superintended the very placing of the furniture. Among\r\nother things he had planned a boudoir which alone represented an\r\nexpenditure of nearly half a million francs.\r\n\r\nLejeune, who had accompanied Marechal Berthier to Vienna to arrange the\r\nmarriage, had returned and given his imperial master a glowing\r\ndescription of the charms of the young archduchess who was to be his\r\nbride. The emperor compared his ideal with her effigy on medals and\r\nminiatures and then worked even more ardently than before that her\r\napartments should be worthy of her when she arrived.\r\n\r\nIt was just following upon this fever of excitement that Napoleon and\r\nthe court had repaired to Compiegne. So restless was the emperor that\r\nhe could hardly bide the time when the archduchess should arrive, and it\r\nwas thus that he set out with Murat to meet the approaching cortege.\r\n\r\nThe pavilion which had been erected for the meeting was left to the\r\ncitizens of the neighbourhood, and the marvellous banquet which had been\r\nprepared by Bausset was likewise abandoned. Napoleon had no time to\r\nthink of dining.\r\n\r\nAll the roadside villages between Soissons and Compiegne were hung with\r\nbanners, and the populace appeared to be as highly excited as the\r\ncontracting parties. It still rained a deluge, but this made no\r\ndifference. Two couriers at full gallop came first to Compiegne, crying:\r\n\"Place\": \"Place\": The eight white horses and the _berlin de voyage_\r\nfollowed. Before one had hardly time to realize what was passing,\r\nNapoleon and his bride whisked by in a twinkling.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock an outpost in the park at Compiegne announced the\r\narrival of the emperor and his train. At ten o'clock a cannon shot rang\r\nout over the park and the emperor and empress passed into the chateau to\r\nproceed with certain indispensable presentations; then to souper, a\r\n_petite souper intime_, we are assured.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow all the world of the assembled court met the empress and\r\navowed that she had that specious _beaute du diable_ which has ever\r\npleased the French connoisseur of beautiful women. They went further,\r\nhowever, and stated that in spite of this ravishing beauty she lacked\r\nthe elegance which should be the possession of an empress of the French.\r\nThe faithful Berthier silenced them with the obvious statement that\r\nsince she pleased the emperor there was nothing more to be said, or\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nFlying northward on the great highroad leading out from Paris to\r\nChantilly and Compiegne gadabout travellers have never a thought that\r\njust beyond Pont Saint Maxence, almost in plain view from the doorway of\r\nthe Inn of the Lion d'Argent of that sleepy little town, is a gabled\r\nwall which represents all that remains of the \"Maison de Philippe de\r\nBeaumanoir,\" called the Cour Basse.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n
