They offer\r\nas a whole a diversified miscellany of literary, artistic, and political\r\nhistory, of critical disquisition and biographic anecdote, such as it is\r\nbelieved cannot be elsewhere found gathered together in a form so\r\nagreeable and so attainable. To this edition is appended a Life of the\r\nAuthor by his son, also original notes, which serve to illustrate or to\r\ncorrect the text, where more recent discoveries have brought to light\r\nfacts unknown when these volumes were originally published.\r\n\r\n                                                    LONDON, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE\r\n\r\nLIFE AND WRITINGS OF MR. DISRAELI.\r\n\r\nBY HIS SON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traditionary notion that the life of a man of letters is necessarily\r\ndeficient in incident, appears to have originated in a misconception of\r\nthe essential nature of human action. The life of every man is full of\r\nincidents, but the incidents are insignificant, because they do not\r\naffect his species; and in general the importance of every occurrence is\r\nto be measured by the degree with which it is recognised by mankind. An\r\nauthor may influence the fortunes of the world to as great an extent as\r\na statesman or a warrior; and the deeds and performances by which this\r\ninfluence is created and exercised, may rank in their interest and\r\nimportance with the decisions of great Congresses, or the skilful valour\r\nof a memorable field. M. de Voltaire was certainly a greater Frenchman\r\nthan Cardinal Fleury, the Prime Minister of France in his time. His\r\nactions were more important; and it is certainly not too much to\r\nmaintain that the exploits of Homer, Aristotle, Dante, or my Lord Bacon,\r\nwere as considerable events as anything that occurred at Actium,\r\nLepanto, or Blenheim. A Book may be as great a thing as a battle, and\r\nthere are systems of philosophy that have produced as great revolutions\r\nas any that have disturbed even the social and political existence of\r\nour centuries.\r\n\r\nThe life of the author, whose character and career we are venturing to\r\nreview, extended far beyond the allotted term of man: and, perhaps, no\r\nexistence of equal duration ever exhibited an uniformity more sustained.\r\nThe strong bent of his infancy was pursued through youth, matured in\r\nmanhood, and maintained without decay to an advanced old age. In the\r\nbiographic spell, no ingredient is more magical than predisposition. How\r\npure, and native, and indigenous it was in the character of this writer,\r\ncan only be properly appreciated by an acquaintance with the\r\ncircumstances amid which he was born, and by being able to estimate how\r\nfar they could have directed or developed his earliest inclinations.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, who became an English Denizen in 1748, was an Italian\r\ndescendant from one of those Hebrew families whom the Inquisition forced\r\nto emigrate from the Spanish Peninsula at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and who found a refuge in the more tolerant territories of the\r\nVenetian Republic. His ancestors had dropped their Gothic surname on\r\ntheir settlement in the Terra Firma, and grateful to the God of Jacob\r\nwho had sustained them through unprecedented trials and guarded them\r\nthrough unheard-of perils, they assumed the name of DISRAELI, a name\r\nnever borne before or since by any other family, in order that their\r\nrace might be for ever recognised. Undisturbed and unmolested, they\r\nflourished as merchants for more than two centuries under the protection\r\nof the lion of St. Mark, which was but just, as the patron saint of the\r\nRepublic was himself a child of Israel. But towards the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, the altered circumstances of England, favourable, as\r\nit was then supposed, to commerce and religious liberty, attracted the\r\nattention of my great-grandfather to this island, and he resolved that\r\nthe youngest of his two sons, Benjamin, the \"son of his right hand,\"\r\nshould settle in a country where the dynasty seemed at length\r\nestablished, through the recent failure of Prince Charles Edward, and\r\nwhere public opinion appeared definitively adverse to persecution on\r\nmatters of creed and conscience.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish families who were then settled in England were few, though,\r\nfrom their wealth and other circumstances, they were far from\r\nunimportant. They were all of them Sephardim, that is to say, children\r\nof Israel, who had never quitted the shores of the Midland Ocean, until\r\nTorquamada had driven them from their pleasant residences and rich\r\nestates in Arragon, and Andalusia, and Portugal, to seek greater\r\nblessings, even than a clear atmosphere and a glowing sun, amid the\r\nmarshes of Holland and the fogs of Britain. Most of these families, who\r\nheld themselves aloof from the Hebrews of Northern Europe, then only\r\noccasionally stealing into England, as from an inferior caste, and whose\r\nsynagogue was reserved only for Sephardim, are now extinct; while the\r\nbranch of the great family, which, notwithstanding their own sufferings\r\nfrom prejudice, they had the hardihood to look down upon, have achieved\r\nan amount of wealth and consideration which the Sephardim, even with the\r\npatronage of Mr. Pelham, never could have contemplated. Nevertheless, at\r\nthe time when my grandfather settled in England, and when Mr. Pelham,\r\nwho was very favourable to the Jews, was Prime Minister, there might be\r\nfound, among other Jewish families flourishing in this country, the\r\nVilla Reals, who brought wealth to these shores almost as great as their\r\nname, though that is the second in Portugal, and who have twice allied\r\nthemselves with the English aristocracy, the Medinas--the Laras, who\r\nwere our kinsmen--and the Mendez da Costas, who, I believe, still exist.\r\n\r\nWhether it were that my grandfather, on his arrival, was not encouraged\r\nby those to whom he had a right to look up,--which is often our hard\r\ncase in the outset of life,--or whether he was alarmed at the unexpected\r\nconsequences of Mr. Pelham's favourable disposition to his countrymen\r\nin the disgraceful repeal of the Jew Bill, which occurred a very few\r\nyears after his arrival in this country, I know not; but certainly he\r\nappears never to have cordially or intimately mixed with his community.\r\nThis tendency to alienation was, no doubt, subsequently encouraged by\r\nhis marriage, which took place in 1765. My grandmother, the beautiful\r\ndaughter of a family who had suffered much from persecution, had imbibed\r\nthat dislike for her race which the vain are too apt to adopt when they\r\nfind that they are born to public contempt. The indignant feeling that\r\nshould be reserved for the persecutor, in the mortification of their\r\ndisturbed sensibility, is too often visited on the victim; and the cause\r\nof annoyance is recognised not in the ignorant malevolence of the\r\npowerful, but in the conscientious conviction of the innocent sufferer.\r\nSeventeen years, however, elapsed before my grandfather entered into\r\nthis union, and during that interval he had not been idle. He was only\r\neighteen when he commenced his career, and when a great responsibility\r\ndevolved upon him. He was not unequal to it. He was a man of ardent\r\ncharacter; sanguine, courageous, speculative, and fortunate; with a\r\ntemper which no disappointment could disturb, and a brain, amid\r\nreverses, full of resource. He made his fortune in the midway of life,\r\nand settled near Enfield, where he formed an Italian garden, entertained\r\nhis friends, played whist with Sir Horace Mann, who was his great\r\nacquaintance, and who had known his brother at Venice as a banker, eat\r\nmacaroni which was dressed by the Venetian Consul, sang canzonettas, and\r\nnotwithstanding a wife who never pardoned him for his name, and a son\r\nwho disappointed all his plans, and who to the last hour of his life was\r\nan enigma to him, lived till he was nearly ninety, and then died in\r\n1817, in the full enjoyment of prolonged existence.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather retired from active business on the eve of that great\r\nfinancial epoch, to grapple with which his talents were well adapted;\r\nand when the wars and loans of the Revolution were about to create those\r\nfamilies of millionaires, in which he might probably have enrolled his\r\nown. That, however, was not our destiny. My grandfather had only one\r\nchild, and nature had disqualified him, from his cradle, for the busy\r\npursuits of men.\r\n\r\nA pale, pensive child, with large dark brown eyes, and flowing hair,\r\nsuch as may be beheld in one of the portraits annexed to these volumes,\r\nhad grown up beneath this roof of worldly energy and enjoyment,\r\nindicating even in his infancy, by the whole carriage of his life, that\r\nhe was of a different order from those among whom he lived. Timid,\r\nsusceptible, lost in reverie, fond of solitude, or seeking no better\r\ncompany than a book, the years had stolen on, till he had arrived at\r\nthat mournful period of boyhood when eccentricities excite attention and\r\ncommand no sympathy. In the chapter on Predisposition, in the most\r\ndelightful of his works,[1] my father has drawn from his own, though his\r\nunacknowledged feelings, immortal truths. Then commenced the age of\r\ndomestic criticism. His mother, not incapable of deep affections, but so\r\nmortified by her social position that she lived until eighty without\r\nindulging in a tender expression, did not recognise in her only\r\noffspring a being qualified to control or vanquish his impending fate.\r\nHis existence only served to swell the aggregate of many humiliating\r\nparticulars. It was not to her a source of joy, or sympathy, or solace.\r\nShe foresaw for her child only a future of degradation. Having a strong,\r\nclear mind, without any imagination, she believed that she beheld an\r\ninevitable doom. The tart remark and the contemptuous comment on her\r\npart, elicited, on the other, all the irritability of the poetic\r\nidiosyncrasy. After frantic ebullitions, for which, when the\r\ncircumstances were analysed by an ordinary mind, there seemed no\r\nsufficient cause, my grandfather always interfered to soothe with\r\ngood-tempered commonplaces, and promote peace. He was a man who thought\r\nthat the only way to make people happy was to make them a present. He\r\ntook it for granted that a boy in a passion wanted a toy or a guinea. At\r\na later date, when my father ran away from home, and after some\r\nwanderings was brought back, found lying on a tombstone in Hackney\r\nchurchyard, he embraced him, and gave him a pony.\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs, being sent to school in the neighbourhood, was\r\na rather agreeable incident. The school was kept by a Scotchman, one\r\nMorison, a good man, and not untinctured with scholarship, and it is\r\npossible that my father might have reaped some advantage from this\r\nchange; but the school was too near home, and his mother, though she\r\ntormented his existence, was never content if he were out of her sight.\r\nHis delicate health was an excuse for converting him, after a short\r\ninterval, into a day scholar; then many days of attendance were omitted;\r\nfinally, the solitary walk home through Mr. Mellish's park was dangerous\r\nto the sensibilities that too often exploded when they encountered on\r\nthe arrival at the domestic hearth a scene which did not harmonise with\r\nthe fairy-land of reverie.\r\n\r\nThe crisis arrived, when, after months of unusual abstraction and\r\nirritability, my father produced a poem. For the first time, my\r\ngrandfather was seriously alarmed. The loss of one of his argosies,\r\nuninsured, could not have filled him with more blank dismay. His idea of\r\na poet was formed from one of the prints of Hogarth hanging in his room,\r\nwhere an unfortunate wight in a garret was inditing an ode to riches,\r\nwhile dunned for his milk-score. Decisive measures were required to\r\neradicate this evil, and to prevent future disgrace--so, as seems the\r\ncustom when a person is in a scrape, it was resolved that my father\r\nshould be sent abroad, where a new scene and a new language might divert\r\nhis mind from the ignominious pursuit which so fatally attracted him.\r\nThe unhappy poet was consigned like a bale of goods to my grandfather's\r\ncorrespondent at Amsterdam, who had instructions to place him at some\r\ncollegium of repute in that city. Here were passed some years not\r\nwithout profit, though his tutor was a great impostor, very neglectful\r\nof his pupils, and both unable and disinclined to guide them in severe\r\nstudies. This preceptor was a man of letters, though a wretched writer,\r\nwith a good library, and a spirit inflamed with all the philosophy of\r\nthe eighteenth century, then (1780-1) about to bring forth and bear its\r\nlong-matured fruits. The intelligence and disposition of my father\r\nattracted his attention, and rather interested him. He taught his charge\r\nlittle, for he was himself generally occupied in writing bad odes, but\r\nhe gave him free warren in his library, and before his pupil was\r\nfifteen, he had read the works of Voltaire and had dipped into Bayle.\r\nStrange that the characteristics of a writer so born and brought up\r\nshould have been so essentially English; not merely from his mastery\r\nover our language, but from his keen and profound sympathy with all that\r\nconcerned the literary and political history of our country at its most\r\nimportant epoch.\r\n\r\nWhen he was eighteen, he returned to England a disciple of Rousseau. He\r\nhad exercised his imagination during the voyage in idealizing the\r\ninterview with his mother, which was to be conducted on both sides with\r\nsublime pathos. His other parent had frequently visited him during his\r\nabsence. He was prepared to throw himself on his mother's bosom, to\r\nbedew her hands with his tears, and to stop her own with his lips; but,\r\nwhen he entered, his strange appearance, his gaunt figure, his excited\r\nmanners, his long hair, and his unfashionable costume, only filled her\r\nwith a sentiment of tender aversion; she broke into derisive laughter,\r\nand noticing his intolerable garments, she reluctantly lent him her\r\ncheek. Whereupon Emile, of course, went into heroics, wept, sobbed, and\r\nfinally, shut up in his chamber, composed an impassioned epistle. My\r\ngrandfather, to soothe him, dwelt on the united solicitude of his\r\nparents for his welfare, and broke to him their intention, if it were\r\nagreeable to him, to place him in the establishment of a great merchant\r\nat Bordeaux. My father replied that he had written a poem of\r\nconsiderable length, which he wished to publish, against Commerce, which\r\nwas the corrupter of man. In eight-and-forty hours confusion again\r\nreigned in this household, and all from a want of psychological\r\nperception in its master and mistress.\r\n\r\nMy father, who had lost the timidity of his childhood, who, by nature,\r\nwas very impulsive, and indeed endowed with a degree of volatility which\r\nis only witnessed in the south of France, and which never deserted him\r\nto his last hour, was no longer to be controlled. His conduct was\r\ndecisive. He enclosed his poem to Dr. Johnson, with an impassioned\r\nstatement of his case, complaining, which he ever did, that he had never\r\nfound a counsellor or literary friend. He left his packet himself at\r\nBolt Court, where he was received by Mr. Francis Barber, the doctor's\r\nwell-known black servant, and told to call again in a week. Be sure that\r\nhe was very punctual; but the packet was returned to him unopened, with\r\na message that the illustrious doctor was too ill to read anything. The\r\nunhappy and obscure aspirant, who received this disheartening message,\r\naccepted it, in his utter despondency, as a mechanical excuse. But,\r\nalas! the cause was too true; and, a few weeks after, on that bed,\r\nbeside which the voice of Mr. Burke faltered, and the tender spirit of\r\nBenett Langton was ever vigilant, the great soul of Johnson quitted\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of self-confidence, the resolution to struggle against\r\nhis fate, the paramount desire to find some sympathising sage--some\r\nguide, philosopher, and friend--was so strong and rooted in my father,\r\nthat I observed, a few weeks ago, in a magazine, an original letter,\r\nwritten by him about this time to Dr. Vicesimus Knox, full of high-flown\r\nsentiments, reading indeed like a romance of Scudery, and entreating\r\nthe learned critic to receive him in his family, and give him the\r\nadvantage of his wisdom, his taste, and his erudition.\r\n\r\nWith a home that ought to have been happy, surrounded with more than\r\ncomfort, with the most good-natured father in the world, and an\r\nagreeable man; and with a mother whose strong intellect, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, might have been of great importance to him; my father,\r\nthough himself of a very sweet disposition, was most unhappy. His\r\nparents looked upon him as moonstruck, while he himself, whatever his\r\naspirations, was conscious that he had done nothing to justify the\r\neccentricity of his course, or the violation of all prudential\r\nconsiderations in which he daily indulged. In these perplexities, the\r\nusual alternative was again had recourse to--absence; he was sent\r\nabroad, to travel in France, which the peace then permitted, visit some\r\nfriends, see Paris, and then proceed to Bordeaux if he felt inclined. My\r\nfather travelled in France, and then proceeded to Paris, where he\r\nremained till the eve of great events in that capital. This was a visit\r\nrecollected with satisfaction. He lived with learned men and moved in\r\nvast libraries, and returned in the earlier part of 1788, with some\r\nlittle knowledge of life, and with a considerable quantity of books.\r\n\r\nAt this time Peter Pindar flourished in all the wantonness of literary\r\nriot. He was at the height of his flagrant notoriety. The novelty and\r\nthe boldness of his style carried the million with him. The most exalted\r\nstation was not exempt from his audacious criticism, and learned\r\ninstitutions trembled at the sallies whose ribaldry often cloaked taste,\r\nintelligence, and good sense. His \"Odes to the Academicians,\" which\r\nfirst secured him the ear of the town, were written by one who could\r\nhimself guide the pencil with skill and feeling, and who, in the form of\r\na mechanic's son, had even the felicity to discover the vigorous genius\r\nof Opie. The mock-heroic which invaded with success the sacred recesses\r\nof the palace, and which was fruitlessly menaced by Secretaries of\r\nState, proved a reckless intrepidity, which is apt to be popular with\r\n\"the general.\" The powerful and the learned quailed beneath the lash\r\nwith an affected contempt which scarcely veiled their tremor. In the\r\nmeantime, as in the latter days of the Empire, the barbarian ravaged the\r\ncountry, while the pale-faced patricians were inactive within the walls.\r\nNo one offered resistance.\r\n\r\nThere appeared about this time a satire \"On the Abuse of Satire.\" The\r\nverses were polished and pointed; a happy echo of that style of Mr. Pope\r\nwhich still lingered in the spell-bound ear of the public. Peculiarly\r\nthey offered a contrast to the irregular effusions of the popular\r\nassailant whom they in turn assailed, for the object of their indignant\r\ninvective was the bard of the \"Lousiad.\" The poem was anonymous, and was\r\naddressed to Dr. Warton in lines of even classic grace. Its publication\r\nwas appropriate. There are moments when every one is inclined to praise,\r\nespecially when the praise of a new pen may at the same time revenge the\r\ninsults of an old one.\r\n\r\nBut if there could be any doubt of the success of this new hand, it was\r\nquickly removed by the conduct of Peter Pindar himself. As is not\r\nunusual with persons of his habits, Wolcot was extremely sensitive, and,\r\nbrandishing a tomahawk, always himself shrank from a scratch. This was\r\nshown some years afterwards by his violent assault on Mr. Gifford, with\r\na bludgeon, in a bookseller's shop, because the author of the \"Baviad\r\nand Mæviad\" had presumed to castigate the great lampooner of the age. In\r\nthe present instance, the furious Wolcot leapt to the rash conclusion,\r\nthat the author of the satire was no less a personage than Mr. Hayley,\r\nand he assailed the elegant author of the \"Triumphs of Temper\" in a\r\nvirulent pasquinade. This ill-considered movement of his adversary of\r\ncourse achieved the complete success of the anonymous writer.\r\n\r\nMy father, who came up to town to read the newspapers at the St. James's\r\nCoffee-house, found their columns filled with extracts from the\r\nfortunate effusion of the hour, conjectures as to its writer, and much\r\ngossip respecting Wolcot and Hayley. He returned to Enfield laden with\r\nthe journals, and, presenting them to his parents, broke to them the\r\nintelligence, that at length he was not only an author, but a successful\r\none.\r\n\r\nHe was indebted to this slight effort for something almost as agreeable\r\nas the public recognition of his ability, and that was the acquaintance,\r\nand almost immediately the warm personal friendship, of Mr. Pye. Mr. Pye\r\nwas the head of an ancient English family that figured in the\r\nParliaments and struggles of the Stuarts; he was member for the County\r\nof Berkshire, where his ancestral seat of Faringdon was situate, and at\r\na later period (1790) became Poet Laureat. In those days, when literary\r\nclubs did not exist, and when even political ones were extremely limited\r\nand exclusive in their character, the booksellers' shops were social\r\nrendezvous. Debrett's was the chief haunt of the Whigs; Hatchard's, I\r\nbelieve, of the Tories. It was at the latter house that my father made\r\nthe acquaintance of Mr. Pye, then publishing his translation of\r\nAristotle's Poetics, and so strong was party feeling at that period,\r\nthat one day, walking together down Piccadilly, Mr. Pye, stopping at the\r\ndoor of Debrett, requested his companion to go in and purchase a\r\nparticular pamphlet for him, adding that if he had the audacity to\r\nenter, more than one person would tread upon his toes.\r\n\r\nMy father at last had a friend. Mr. Pye, though double his age, was\r\nstill a young man, and the literary sympathy between them was complete.\r\nUnfortunately, the member for Berkshire was a man rather of an elegant\r\nturn of mind, than one of that energy and vigour which a youth required\r\nfor a companion at that moment. Their tastes and pursuits were perhaps a\r\nlittle too similar. They addressed poetical epistles to each other, and\r\nwere, reciprocally, too gentle critics. But Mr. Pye was a most amiable\r\nand accomplished man, a fine classical scholar, and a master of correct\r\nversification. He paid a visit to Enfield, and by his influence hastened\r\na conclusion at which my grandfather was just arriving, to wit, that he\r\nwould no longer persist in the fruitless effort of converting a poet\r\ninto a merchant, and that content with the independence he had realised,\r\nhe would abandon his dreams of founding a dynasty of financiers. From\r\nthis moment all disquietude ceased beneath this always well-meaning,\r\nthough often perplexed, roof, while my father, enabled amply to gratify\r\nhis darling passion of book-collecting, passed his days in tranquil\r\nstudy, and in the society of congenial spirits.\r\n\r\nHis new friend introduced him almost immediately to Mr. James Pettit\r\nAndrews, a Berkshire gentleman of literary pursuits, and whose\r\nhospitable table at Brompton was the resort of the best literary society\r\nof the day. Here my father was a frequent guest, and walking home one\r\nnight together from this house, where they had both dined, he made the\r\nacquaintance of a young poet, which soon ripened into intimacy, and\r\nwhich throughout sixty years, notwithstanding many changes of life,\r\nnever died away. This youthful poet had already gained laurels, though\r\nhe was only three or four years older than my father, but I am not at\r\nthis moment quite aware whether his brow was yet encircled with the\r\namaranthine wreath of the \"Pleasures of Memory.\"\r\n\r\nSome years after this, great vicissitudes unhappily occurred in the\r\nfamily of Mr. Pye. He was obliged to retire from Parliament, and to sell\r\nhis family estate of Faringdon. His Majesty had already, on the death of\r\nThomas Warton, nominated him Poet Laureat, and after his retirement from\r\nParliament, the government which he had supported, appointed him a\r\nCommissioner of Police. It was in these days that his friend, Mr. Penn,\r\nof Stoke Park, in Buckinghamshire, presented him with a cottage worthy\r\nof a poet on his beautiful estate; and it was thus my father became\r\nacquainted with the amiable descendant of the most successful of\r\ncolonisers, and with that classic domain which the genius of Gray, as it\r\nwere, now haunts, and has for ever hallowed, and from which he beheld\r\nwith fond and musing eye, those\r\n\r\n    Distant spires and antique towers,\r\n\r\nthat no one can now look upon without remembering him. It was amid these\r\nrambles in Stoke Park, amid the scenes of Gray's genius, the elegiac\r\nchurchyard, and the picturesque fragments of the Long Story, talking\r\nover the deeds of \"Great Rebellion\" with the descendants of Cavaliers\r\nand Parliament-men, that my father first imbibed that feeling for the\r\ncounty of Buckingham, which induced him occasionally to be a dweller in\r\nits limits, and ultimately, more than a quarter of a century afterwards,\r\nto establish his household gods in its heart. And here, perhaps, I may\r\nbe permitted to mention a circumstance, which is indeed trifling, and\r\nyet, as a coincidence, not, I think, without interest. Mr. Pye was the\r\ngreat-grandson of Sir Robert Pye, of Bradenham, who married Anne, the\r\neldest daughter of Mr. Hampden. How little could my father dream, sixty\r\nyears ago, that he would pass the last quarter of his life in the\r\nmansion-house of Bradenham; that his name would become intimately\r\nconnected with the county of Buckingham; and that his own remains would\r\nbe interred in the vault of the chancel of Bradenham Church, among the\r\ncoffins of the descendants of the Hampdens and the Pyes. All which\r\nshould teach us that whatever may be our natural bent, there is a power\r\nin the disposal of events greater than human will.\r\n\r\nIt was about two years after his first acquaintance with Mr. Pye, that\r\nmy father, being then in his twenty-fifth year, influenced by the circle\r\nin which he then lived, gave an anonymous volume to the press, the fate\r\nof which he could little have foreseen. The taste for literary history\r\nwas then of recent date in England. It was developed by Dr. Johnson and\r\nthe Wartons, who were the true founders of that elegant literature in\r\nwhich France had so richly preceded us. The fashion for literary\r\nanecdote prevailed at the end of the last century. Mr. Pettit Andrews,\r\nassisted by Mr. Pye and Captain Grose, and shortly afterwards, his\r\nfriend, Mr. Seward, in his \"Anecdotes of Distinguished Persons,\" had\r\nboth of them produced ingenious works, which had experienced public\r\nfavour. But these volumes were rather entertaining than substantial, and\r\ntheir interest in many instances was necessarily fleeting; all which\r\nmade Mr. Rogers observe, that the world was far gone in its anecdotage.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Andrews and his friend were hunting for personal details in\r\nthe recollections of their contemporaries, my father maintained one day,\r\nthat the most interesting of miscellanies might be drawn up by a\r\nwell-read man from the library in which he lived. It was objected, on\r\nthe other hand, that such a work would be a mere compilation, and could\r\nnot succeed with its dead matter in interesting the public. To test the\r\ntruth of this assertion, my father occupied himself in the preparation\r\nof an octavo volume, the principal materials of which were found in the\r\ndiversified collections of the French Ana; but he enriched his subjects\r\nwith as much of our own literature as his reading afforded, and he\r\nconveyed the result in that lively and entertaining style which he from\r\nthe first commanded. This collection of \"Anecdotes, Characters,\r\nSketches, and Observations; Literary, Critical, and Historical,\" as the\r\ntitle-page of the first edition figures, he invested with the happy\r\nbaptism of \"Curiosities of Literature.\"\r\n\r\nHe sought by this publication neither reputation nor a coarser reward,\r\nfor he published his work anonymously, and avowedly as a compilation;\r\nand he not only published the work at his own expense, but in his\r\nheedlessness made a present of the copyright to the bookseller, which\r\nthree or four years afterwards he was fortunate enough to purchase at a\r\npublic sale. The volume was an experiment whether a taste for literature\r\ncould not be infused into the multitude. Its success was so decided,\r\nthat its projector was tempted to add a second volume two years\r\nafterward, with a slight attempt at more original research; I observe\r\nthat there was a second edition of both volumes in 1794. For twenty\r\nyears the brother volumes remained favourites of the public; when after\r\nthat long interval their writer, taking advantage of a popular title,\r\npoured forth all the riches of his matured intellect, his refined taste,\r\nand accumulated knowledge into their pages, and produced what may be\r\nfairly described as the most celebrated Miscellany of Modern Literature.\r\n\r\nThe moment that the name of the youthful author of the \"Abuse of Satire\"\r\nhad transpired, Peter Pindar, faithful to the instinct of his nature,\r\nwrote a letter of congratulation and compliment to his assailant, and\r\ndesired to make his acquaintance. The invitation was responded to, and\r\nuntil the death of Wolcot, they were intimate. My father always\r\ndescribed Wolcot as a warm-hearted man; coarse in his manners, and\r\nrather rough, but eager to serve those whom he liked, of which, indeed,\r\nI might appropriately mention an instance.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, that about the year 1795, when he was in his 29th year\r\nthere came over my father that mysterious illness to which the youth of\r\nmen of sensibility, and especially literary men, is frequently\r\nsubject--a failing of nervous energy, occasioned by study and too\r\nsedentary habits, early and habitual reverie, restless and indefinite\r\npurpose. The symptoms, physical and moral, are most distressing:\r\nlassitude and despondency. And it usually happens, as in the present\r\ninstance, that the cause of suffering is not recognised; and that\r\nmedical men, misled by the superficial symptoms, and not seeking to\r\nacquaint themselves with the psychology of their patients, arrive at\r\nerroneous, often fatal, conclusions. In this case, the most eminent of\r\nthe faculty gave it as their opinion, that the disease was consumption.\r\nDr. Turton, if I recollect right, was then the most considered physician\r\nof the day. An immediate visit to a warmer climate was his specific; and\r\nas the Continent was then disturbed and foreign residence out of the\r\nquestion, Dr. Turton recommended that his patient should establish\r\nhimself without delay in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nWhen my father communicated this impending change in his life to Wolcot,\r\nthe modern Skelton shook his head. He did not believe that his friend\r\nwas in a consumption, but being a Devonshire man, and loving very much\r\nhis native province, he highly approved of the remedy. He gave my father\r\nseveral letters of introduction to persons of consideration at Exeter;\r\namong others, one whom he justly described as a poet and a physician,\r\nand the best of men, the late Dr. Hugh Downman. Provincial cities very\r\noften enjoy a transient term of intellectual distinction. An eminent man\r\noften collects around him congenial spirits, and the power of\r\nassociation sometimes produces distant effects which even an individual,\r\nhowever gifted, could scarcely have anticipated. A combination of\r\ncircumstances had made at this time Exeter a literary metropolis. A\r\nnumber of distinguished men flourished there at the same moment: some of\r\ntheir names are even now remembered. Jackson of Exeter still survives as\r\na native composer of original genius. He was also an author of high\r\næsthetical speculation. The heroic poems of Hole are forgotten, but his\r\nessay on the Arabian Nights is still a cherished volume of elegant and\r\nlearned criticism. Hayter was the classic antiquary who first discovered\r\nthe art of unrolling the MSS. of Herculaneum. There were many others,\r\nnoisier and more bustling, who are now forgotten, though they in some\r\ndegree influenced the literary opinion of their time. It was said, and I\r\nbelieve truly, that the two principal, if not sole, organs of periodical\r\ncriticism at that time, I think the \"Critical Review\" and the \"Monthly\r\nReview,\" were principally supported by Exeter contributions. No doubt\r\nthis circumstance may account for a great deal of mutual praise and\r\nsympathetic opinion on literary subjects, which, by a convenient\r\narrangement, appeared in the pages of publications otherwise professing\r\ncontrary opinions on all others. Exeter had then even a learned society\r\nwhich published its Transactions.\r\n\r\nWith such companions, by whom he was received with a kindness and\r\nhospitality which to the last he often dwelt on, it may easily be\r\nsupposed that the banishment of my father from the delights of literary\r\nLondon was not as productive a source of gloom as the exile of Ovid to\r\nthe savage Pontus, even if it had not been his happy fortune to have\r\nbeen received on terms of intimate friendship by the accomplished family\r\nof Mr. Baring, who was then member for Exeter, and beneath whose roof he\r\npassed a great portion of the period of nearly three years during which\r\nhe remained in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nThe illness of my father was relieved, but not removed, by this change\r\nof life. Dr. Downman was his physician, whose only remedies were port\r\nwine, horse-exercise, rowing on the neighbouring river, and the\r\ndistraction of agreeable society. This wise physician recognised the\r\ntemperament of his patient, and perceived that his physical derangement\r\nwas an effect instead of a cause. My father instead of being in a\r\nconsumption, was endowed with a frame of almost super-human strength,\r\nand which was destined for half a century of continuous labour and\r\nsedentary life. The vital principle in him, indeed, was so strong that\r\nwhen he left us at eighty-two, it was only as the victim of a violent\r\nepidemic, against whose virulence he struggled with so much power, that\r\nit was clear, but for this casualty, he might have been spared to this\r\nworld even for several years.\r\n\r\nI should think that this illness of his youth, and which, though of a\r\nfitful character, was of many years' duration, arose from his inability\r\nto direct to a satisfactory end the intellectual power which he was\r\nconscious of possessing. He would mention the ten years of his life,\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty-five years of age, as a period very deficient\r\nin self-contentedness. The fact is, with a poetic temperament, he had\r\nbeen born in an age when the poetic faith of which he was a votary had\r\nfallen into decrepitude, and had become only a form with the public, not\r\nyet gifted with sufficient fervour to discover a new creed. He was a\r\npupil of Pope and Boileau, yet both from his native impulse and from the\r\nglowing influence of Rousseau, he felt the necessity and desire of\r\ninfusing into the verse of the day more passion than might resound from\r\nthe frigid lyre of Mr. Hayley. My father had fancy, sensibility, and an\r\nexquisite taste, but he had not that rare creative power, which the\r\nblended and simultaneous influence of the individual organisation and\r\nthe spirit of the age, reciprocally acting upon each other, can alone,\r\nperhaps, perfectly develope; the absence of which, at periods of\r\ntransition, is so universally recognised and deplored, and yet which\r\nalways, when it does arrive, captivates us, as it were, by surprise. How\r\nmuch there was of freshness, and fancy, and natural pathos in his mind,\r\nmay be discerned in his Persian romance of \"The Loves of Mejnoon and\r\nLeila.\" We who have been accustomed to the great poets of the nineteenth\r\ncentury seeking their best inspiration in the climate and manners of the\r\nEast; who are familiar with the land of the Sun from the isles of Ionia\r\nto the vales of Cashmere; can scarcely appreciate the literary\r\noriginality of a writer who, fifty years ago, dared to devise a real\r\nEastern story, and seeking inspiration in the pages of Oriental\r\nliterature, compose it with reference to the Eastern mind, and customs,\r\nand landscape. One must have been familiar with the Almorans and Hamets,\r\nthe Visions of Mirza and the kings of Ethiopia, and the other dull and\r\nmonstrous masquerades of Orientalism then prevalent, to estimate such an\r\nenterprise, in which, however, one should not forget the author had the\r\nadvantage of the guiding friendship of that distinguished Orientalist,\r\nSir William Ouseley. The reception of this work by the public, and of\r\nother works of fiction which its author gave to them anonymously, was in\r\nevery respect encouraging, and their success may impartially be\r\nregistered as fairly proportionate to their merits; but it was not a\r\nsuccess, or a proof of power, which, in my father's opinion, compensated\r\nfor that life of literary research and study which their composition\r\ndisturbed and enfeebled. It was at the ripe age of five-and-thirty that\r\nhe renounced his dreams of being an author, and resolved to devote\r\nhimself for the rest of his life to the acquisition of knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhen my father, many years afterwards, made the acquaintance of Sir\r\nWalter Scott, the great poet saluted him by reciting a poem of\r\nhalf-a-dozen stanzas which my father had written in his early youth. Not\r\naltogether without agitation, surprise was expressed that these lines\r\nshould have been known, still more that they should have been\r\nremembered. \"Ah!\" said Sir Walter, \"if the writer of these lines had\r\ngone on, he would have been an English poet.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIt is possible; it is even probable that, if my father had devoted\r\nhimself to the art, he might have become the author of some elegant and\r\npopular didactic poem, on some ordinary subject, which his fancy would\r\nhave adorned with grace and his sensibility invested with sentiment;\r\nsome small volume which might have reposed with a classic title upon our\r\nlibrary shelves, and served as a prize volume at Ladies' Schools. This\r\ncelebrity was not reserved for him: instead of this he was destined to\r\ngive to his country a series of works illustrative of its literary and\r\npolitical history, full of new information and new views, which time\r\nand opinion has ratified as just. But the poetical temperament was not\r\nthrown away upon him; it never is on any one; it was this great gift\r\nwhich prevented his being a mere literary antiquary; it was this which\r\nanimated his page with picture and his narrative with interesting\r\nvivacity; above all, it was this temperament, which invested him with\r\nthat sympathy with his subject, which made him the most delightful\r\nbiographer in our language. In a word, it was because he was a poet,\r\nthat he was a popular writer, and made belles-lettres charming to the\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\nIt was during the ten years that now occurred that he mainly acquired\r\nthat store of facts which were the foundation of his future\r\nspeculations. His pen was never idle, but it was to note and to\r\nregister, not to compose. His researches were prosecuted every morning\r\namong the MSS. of the British Museum, while his own ample collections\r\npermitted him to pursue his investigation in his own library into the\r\nnight. The materials which he accumulated during this period are only\r\npartially exhausted. At the end of ten years, during which, with the\r\nexception of one anonymous work, he never indulged in composition, the\r\nirresistible desire of communicating his conclusions to the world came\r\nover him, and after all his almost childish aspirations, his youth of\r\nreverie and hesitating and imperfect effort, he arrived at the mature\r\nage of forty-five before his career as a great author, influencing\r\nopinion, really commenced.\r\n\r\nThe next ten years passed entirely in production: from 1812 to 1822 the\r\npress abounded with his works. His \"Calamities of Authors,\" his \"Memoirs\r\nof Literary Controversy,\" in the manner of Bayle; his \"Essay on the\r\nLiterary Character,\" the most perfect of his compositions; were all\r\nchapters in that History of English Literature which he then commenced\r\nto meditate, and which it was fated should never be completed.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period also that he published his \"Inquiry into the\r\nLiterary and Political Character of James the First,\" in which he first\r\nopened those views respecting the times and the conduct of the Stuarts,\r\nwhich were opposed to the long prevalent opinions of this country, but\r\nwhich with him were at least the result of unprejudiced research, and\r\ntheir promulgation, as he himself expressed it, \"an affair of literary\r\nconscience.\"[3]\r\n\r\nBut what retarded his project of a History of our Literature at this\r\ntime was the almost embarrassing success of his juvenile production,\r\n\"The Curiosities of Literature.\" These two volumes had already reached\r\nfive editions, and their author found himself, by the public demand,\r\nagain called upon to sanction their re-appearance. Recognising in this\r\ncircumstance some proof of their utility, he resolved to make the work\r\nmore worthy of the favour which it enjoyed, and more calculated to\r\nproduce the benefit which he desired. Without attempting materially to\r\nalter the character of the first two volumes, he revised and enriched\r\nthem, while at the same time he added a third volume of a vein far more\r\ncritical, and conveying the results of much original research. The\r\nsuccess of this publication was so great, that its author, after much\r\nhesitation, resolved, as he was wont to say, to take advantage of a\r\npopular title, and pour forth the treasures of his mind in three\r\nadditional volumes, which, unlike continuations in general, were at once\r\ngreeted with the highest degree of popular delight and esteem. And,\r\nindeed, whether we consider the choice variety of the subjects, the\r\ncritical and philosophical speculation which pervades them, the amount\r\nof new and interesting information brought to bear, and the animated\r\nstyle in which all is conveyed, it is difficult to conceive\r\nmiscellaneous literature in a garb more stimulating and attractive.\r\nThese six volumes, after many editions, are now condensed into the form\r\nat present given to the public, and in which the development of the\r\nwriter's mind for a quarter of a century may be completely traced.\r\n\r\nAlthough my father had on the whole little cause to complain of unfair\r\ncriticism, especially considering how isolated he always remained, it is\r\nnot to be supposed that a success so eminent should have been exempt in\r\nso long a course from some captious comments. It has been alleged of\r\nlate years by some critics, that he was in the habit of exaggerating the\r\nimportance of his researches; that he was too fond of styling every\r\naccession to our knowledge, however slight, as a discovery; that there\r\nwere some inaccuracies in his early volumes (not very wonderful in so\r\nmultifarious a work), and that the foundation of his \"secret history\"\r\nwas often only a single letter, or a passage in a solitary diary.\r\n\r\nThe sources of secret history at the present day are so rich and\r\nvarious; there is such an eagerness among their possessors to publish\r\nfamily papers, even sometimes in shapes, and at dates so recent, as\r\nscarcely to justify their appearance; that modern critics, in their\r\nembarrassment of manuscript wealth, are apt to view with too\r\ndepreciating an eye the more limited resources of men of letters at the\r\ncommencement of the century. Not five-and-twenty years ago, when\r\npreparing his work on King Charles the First, the application of my\r\nfather to make some researches in the State Paper Office was refused by\r\nthe Secretary of State of the day. Now, foreign potentates and ministers\r\nof State, and public corporations and the heads of great houses, feel\r\nhonoured by such appeals, and respond to them with cordiality. It is not\r\nonly the State Paper Office of England, but the Archives of France,\r\nthat are open to the historical investigator. But what has produced this\r\ngeneral and expanding taste for literary research in the world, and\r\nespecially in England? The labours of our elder authors, whose taste and\r\nacuteness taught us the value of the materials which we in our ignorance\r\nneglected. When my father first frequented the reading-room of the\r\nBritish Museum at the end of the last century, his companions never\r\nnumbered half-a-dozen; among them, if I remember rightly, were Mr.\r\nPinkerton and Mr. Douce. Now these daily pilgrims of research may be\r\ncounted by as many hundreds. Few writers have more contributed to form\r\nand diffuse this delightful and profitable taste for research than the\r\nauthor of the \"Curiosities of Literature;\" few writers have been more\r\nsuccessful in inducing us to pause before we accepted without a scruple\r\nthe traditionary opinion that has distorted a fact or calumniated a\r\ncharacter; and independently of every other claim which he possesses to\r\npublic respect, his literary discoveries, viewed in relation to the age\r\nand the means, were considerable. But he had other claims: a vital\r\nspirit in his page, kindred with the souls of a Bayle and a Montaigne.\r\nHis innumerable imitators and their inevitable failure for half a\r\ncentury alone prove this, and might have made them suspect that there\r\nwere some ingredients in the spell besides the accumulation of facts and\r\na happy title. Many of their publications, perpetually appearing and\r\nconstantly forgotten, were drawn up by persons of considerable\r\nacquirements, and were ludicrously mimetic of their prototype, even as\r\nto the size of the volume and the form of the page. What has become of\r\nthese \"Varieties of Literature,\" and \"Delights of Literature,\" and\r\n\"Delicacies of Literature,\" and \"Relics of Literature,\"--and the other\r\nProtean forms of uninspired compilation? Dead as they deserve to be:\r\nwhile the work, the idea of which occurred to its writer in his early\r\nyouth, and which he lived virtually to execute in all the ripeness of\r\nhis studious manhood, remains as fresh and popular as ever,--the\r\nLiterary Miscellany of the English People.\r\n\r\nI have ventured to enter into some details as to the earlier and\r\nobscurer years of my father's life, because I thought that they threw\r\nlight upon human character, and that without them, indeed, a just\r\nappreciation of his career could hardly be formed. I am mistaken, if we\r\ndo not recognise in his instance two very interesting qualities of life:\r\npredisposition and self-formation. There was a third, which I think is\r\nto be honoured, and that was his sympathy with his order. No one has\r\nwritten so much about authors, and so well. Indeed, before his time, the\r\nLiterary Character had never been fairly placed before the world. He\r\ncomprehended its idiosyncrasy: all its strength and all its weakness. He\r\ncould soften, because he could explain, its infirmities; in the analysis\r\nand record of its power, he vindicated the right position of authors in\r\nthe social scale. They stand between the governors and the governed, he\r\nimpresses on us in the closing pages of his greatest work.[4] Though he\r\nshared none of the calamities, and scarcely any of the controversies, of\r\nliterature, no one has sympathised so intimately with the sorrows, or so\r\nzealously and impartially registered the instructive disputes, of\r\nliterary men. He loved to celebrate the exploits of great writers, and\r\nto show that, in these ages, the pen is a weapon as puissant as the\r\nsword. He was also the first writer who vindicated the position of the\r\ngreat artist in the history of genius. His pages are studded with\r\npregnant instances and graceful details, borrowed from the life of Art\r\nand its votaries, and which his intimate and curious acquaintance with\r\nItalian letters readily and happily supplied. Above all writers, he has\r\nmaintained the greatness of intellect, and the immortality of thought.\r\n\r\nHe was himself a complete literary character, a man who really passed\r\nhis life in his library. Even marriage produced no change in these\r\nhabits; he rose to enter the chamber where he lived alone with his\r\nbooks, and at night his lamp was ever lit within the same walls.\r\nNothing, indeed, was more remarkable than the isolation of this\r\nprolonged existence; and it could only be accounted for by the united\r\ninfluence of three causes: his birth, which brought him no relations or\r\nfamily acquaintance; the bent of his disposition; and the circumstance\r\nof his inheriting an independent fortune, which rendered unnecessary\r\nthose exertions that would have broken up his self-reliance. He disliked\r\nbusiness, and he never required relaxation; he was absorbed in his\r\npursuits. In London his only amusement was to ramble among booksellers;\r\nif he entered a club, it was only to go into the library. In the\r\ncountry, he scarcely ever left his room but to saunter in abstraction\r\nupon a terrace; muse over a chapter, or coin a sentence. He had not a\r\nsingle passion or prejudice: all his convictions were the result of his\r\nown studies, and were often opposed to the impressions which he had\r\nearly imbibed. He not only never entered into the politics of the day,\r\nbut he could never understand them. He never was connected with any\r\nparticular body or set of men; comrades of school or college, or\r\nconfederates in that public life which, in England, is, perhaps, the\r\nonly foundation of real friendship. In the consideration of a question,\r\nhis mind was quite undisturbed by traditionary preconceptions; and it\r\nwas this exemption from passion and prejudice which, although his\r\nintelligence was naturally somewhat too ingenious and fanciful for the\r\nconduct of close argument, enabled him, in investigation, often to show\r\nmany of the highest attributes of the judicial mind, and particularly to\r\nsum up evidence with singular happiness and ability.\r\n\r\nAlthough in private life he was of a timid nature, his moral courage as\r\na writer was unimpeachable. Most certainly, throughout his long career,\r\nhe never wrote a sentence which he did not believe was true. He will\r\ngenerally be found to be the advocate of the discomfited and the\r\noppressed. So his conclusions are often opposed to popular impressions.\r\nThis was from no love of paradox, to which he was quite superior; but\r\nbecause in the conduct of his researches, he too often found that the\r\nunfortunate are calumniated. His vindication of King James the First, he\r\nhas himself described as \"an affair of literary conscience:\" his greater\r\nwork on the Life and Times of the son of the first Stuart arose from the\r\nsame impulse. He had deeply studied our history during the first moiety\r\nof the seventeenth century; he looked upon it as a famous age; he was\r\nfamiliar with the works of its great writers, and there was scarcely one\r\nof its almost innumerable pamphlets with which he was not acquainted.\r\nDuring the thoughtful investigations of many years, he had arrived at\r\nresults which were not adapted to please the passing multitude, but\r\nwhich, because he held them to be authentic, he was uneasy lest he\r\nshould die without recording. Yet strong as were his convictions,\r\nalthough, notwithstanding his education in the revolutionary philosophy\r\nof the eighteenth century, his nature and his studies had made him a\r\nvotary of loyalty and reverence, his pen was always prompt to do justice\r\nto those who might be looked upon as the adversaries of his own cause:\r\nand this was because his cause was really truth. If he has upheld Laud\r\nunder unjust aspersions, the last labour of his literary life was to\r\nvindicate the character of Hugh Peters. If, from the recollection of the\r\nsufferings of his race, and from profound reflection on the principles\r\nof the Institution, he was hostile to the Papacy, no writer in our\r\nliterature has done more complete justice to the conduct of the English\r\nRomanists. Who can read his history of Chidiock Titchbourne unmoved? or\r\ncan refuse to sympathise with his account of the painful difficulties of\r\nthe English Monarchs with their loyal subjects of the old faith? If in\r\na parliamentary country he has dared to criticise the conduct of\r\nParliaments, it was only because an impartial judgment had taught him,\r\nas he himself expresses it, that \"Parliaments have their passions as\r\nwell as individuals.\"\r\n\r\nHe was five years in the composition of his work on the \"Life and Reign\r\nof Charles the First,\" and the five volumes appeared at intervals\r\nbetween 1828 and 1831. It was feared by his publisher, that the\r\ndistracted epoch at which this work was issued, and the tendency of the\r\ntimes, apparently so adverse to his own views, might prove very\r\ninjurious to its reception. But the effect of these circumstances was\r\nthe reverse. The minds of men were inclined to the grave and national\r\nconsiderations that were involved in these investigations. The\r\nprinciples of political institutions, the rival claims of the two Houses\r\nof Parliament, the authority of the Established Church, the demands of\r\nreligious sects, were, after a long lapse of years, anew the theme of\r\npublic discussion. Men were attracted to a writer who traced the origin\r\nof the anti-monarchical principle in modern Europe; treated of the arts\r\nof insurgency; gave them, at the same time, a critical history of the\r\nPuritans, and a treatise on the genius of the Papacy; scrutinised the\r\nconduct of triumphant patriots, and vindicated a decapitated monarch.\r\nThe success of this work was eminent; and its author appeared for the\r\nfirst and only time of his life in public, when amidst the cheers of\r\nunder-graduates, and the applause of graver men, the solitary student\r\nreceived an honorary degree from the University of Oxford, a fitting\r\nhomage, in the language of the great University, \"OPTIMI REGIS OPTIMO\r\nVINDICI.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot but recall a trait that happened on this occasion. After my\r\nfather returned to his hotel from the theatre, a stranger requested an\r\ninterview with him. A Swiss gentleman, travelling in England at the\r\ntime, who had witnessed the scene just closed, begged to express the\r\nreason why he presumed thus personally and cordially to congratulate\r\nthe new Doctor of Civil Law. He was the son of my grandfather's chief\r\nclerk, and remembered his parent's employer; whom he regretted did not\r\nsurvive to be aware of this honourable day. Thus, amid all the strange\r\nvicissitudes of life, we are ever, as it were, moving in a circle.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding he was now approaching his seventieth year, his health\r\nbeing unbroken and his constitution very robust, my father resolved\r\nvigorously to devote himself to the composition of the history of our\r\nvernacular Literature. He hesitated for a moment, whether he should at\r\nonce address himself to this greater task, or whether he should first\r\ncomplete a Life of Pope, for which he had made great preparations, and\r\nwhich had long occupied his thoughts. His review of \"Spence's Anecdotes\"\r\nin the Quarterly, so far back as 1820, which gave rise to the celebrated\r\nPope Controversy, in which Mr. Campbell, Lord Byron, Mr. Bowles, Mr.\r\nRoscoe, and others less eminent broke lances, would prove how well\r\nqualified, even at that distant date, the critic was to become the\r\nbiographer of the great writer, whose literary excellency and moral\r\nconduct he, on that occasion, alike vindicated. But, unfortunately as it\r\nturned out, my father was persuaded to address himself to the weightier\r\ntask. Hitherto, in his publications, he had always felt an extreme\r\nreluctance to travel over ground which others had previously visited. He\r\nliked to give new matter, and devote himself to detached points, on\r\nwhich he entertained different opinions from those prevalent. Thus his\r\nworks are generally of a supplementary character, and assume in their\r\nreaders a certain degree of preliminary knowledge. In the present\r\ninstance he was induced to frame his undertaking on a different scale,\r\nand to prepare a history which should be complete in itself, and supply\r\nthe reader with a perfect view of the gradual formation of our language\r\nand literature. He proposed to effect this in six volumes; though, I\r\napprehend, he would not have succeeded in fulfilling his intentions\r\nwithin that limit. His treatment of the period of Queen Anne would have\r\nbeen very ample, and he would also have accomplished in this general\r\nwork a purpose which he had also long contemplated, and for which he had\r\nmade curious and extensive collections, namely, a History of the English\r\nFreethinkers.\r\n\r\nBut all these great plans were destined to a terrible defeat. Towards\r\nthe end of the year 1839, still in the full vigour of his health and\r\nintellect, he suffered a paralysis of the optic nerve; and that eye,\r\nwhich for so long a term had kindled with critical interest over the\r\nvolumes of so many literatures and so many languages, was doomed to\r\npursue its animated course no more. Considering the bitterness of such a\r\ncalamity to one whose powers were otherwise not in the least impaired,\r\nhe bore on the whole his fate with magnanimity, even with cheerfulness.\r\nUnhappily, his previous habits of study and composition rendered the\r\nhabit of dictation intolerable, even impossible to him. But with the\r\nassistance of his daughter, whose intelligent solicitude he has\r\ncommemorated in more than one grateful passage, he selected from his\r\nmanuscripts three volumes, which he wished to have published under the\r\nbecoming title of \"A Fragment of a History of English Literature,\" but\r\nwhich were eventually given to the public under that of \"Amenities of\r\nLiterature.\"\r\n\r\nHe was also enabled during these last years of physical, though not of\r\nmoral, gloom, to prepare a new edition of his work on the Life and Times\r\nof Charles the First, which had been for some time out of print. He\r\ncontrived, though slowly, and with great labour, very carefully to\r\nrevise, and improve, and enrich these volumes. He was wont to say that\r\nthe best monument to an author was a good edition of his works: it is my\r\npurpose that he should possess this memorial. He has been described by a\r\ngreat authority as a writer sui generis; and indeed had he never\r\nwritten, it appears to me, that there would have been a gap in our\r\nlibraries, which it would have been difficult to supply. Of him it might\r\nbe added that, for an author, his end was an euthanasia, for on the day\r\nbefore he was seized by that fatal epidemic, of the danger of which, to\r\nthe last moment, he was unconscious, he was apprised by his publishers,\r\nthat all his works were out of print, and that their re-publication\r\ncould no longer be delayed.\r\n\r\nIn this notice of the career of my father, I have ventured to draw\r\nattention to three circumstances which I thought would be esteemed\r\ninteresting; namely, predisposition, self-formation, and sympathy with\r\nhis order. There is yet another which completes and crowns the\r\ncharacter,--constancy of purpose; and it is only in considering his\r\ncourse as a whole, that we see how harmonious and consistent have been\r\nthat life and its labours, which, in a partial and brief view, might be\r\nsupposed to have been somewhat desultory and fragmentary.\r\n\r\nOn his moral character I shall scarcely presume to dwell. The\r\nphilosophic sweetness of his disposition, the serenity of his lot, and\r\nthe elevating nature of his pursuits, combined to enable him to pass\r\nthrough life without an evil act, almost without an evil thought. As the\r\nworld has always been fond of personal details respecting men who have\r\nbeen celebrated, I will mention that he was fair, with a Bourbon nose,\r\nand brown eyes of extraordinary beauty and lustre. He wore a small black\r\nvelvet cap, but his white hair latterly touched his shoulders in curls\r\nalmost as flowing as in his boyhood. His extremities were delicate and\r\nwell-formed, and his leg, at his last hour, as shapely as in his youth,\r\nwhich showed the vigour of his frame. Latterly he had become corpulent.\r\nHe did not excel in conversation, though in his domestic circle he was\r\ngarrulous. Everything interested him; and blind, and eighty-two, he was\r\nstill as susceptible as a child. One of his last acts was to compose\r\nsome verses of gay gratitude to his daughter-in-law, who was his London\r\ncorrespondent, and to whose lively pen his last years were indebted for\r\nconstant amusement. He had by nature a singular volatility which never\r\ndeserted him. His feelings, though always amiable, were not painfully\r\ndeep, and amid joy or sorrow, the philosophic vein was ever evident. He\r\nmore resembled Goldsmith than any man that I can compare him to: in his\r\nconversation, his apparent confusion of ideas ending with some\r\nfelicitous phrase of genius, his naïveté, his simplicity not untouched\r\nwith a dash of sarcasm affecting innocence--one was often reminded of\r\nthe gifted and interesting friend of Burke and Johnson. There was,\r\nhowever, one trait in which my father did not resemble Goldsmith: he had\r\nno vanity. Indeed, one of his few infirmities was rather a deficiency of\r\nself-esteem.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I hope--nay I believe--that taking all into\r\nconsideration--the integrity and completeness of his existence, the fact\r\nthat, for sixty years, he largely contributed to form the taste, charm\r\nthe leisure, and direct the studious dispositions, of the great body of\r\nthe public, and that his works have extensively and curiously\r\nillustrated the literary and political history of our country, it will\r\nbe conceded, that in his life and labours, he repaid England for the\r\nprotection and the hospitality which this country accorded to his father\r\na century ago.\r\n                                                               D.\r\n\r\n  HUGHENDEN MANOR,\r\n  _Christmas_, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Essay on the Literary Character,\" Vol. I. chap. v.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Sir Walter was sincere, for he inserted the poem in the\r\n\"English Minstrelsy.\" It may now be found in these volumes, Vol. I. p.\r\n230, where, in consequence of the recollection of Sir Walter, and as\r\nillustrative of manners now obsolete, it was subsequently inserted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"The present inquiry originates in an affair of literary\r\nconscience.

The first elegant scholar who opened a richer vein in the mine of\r\nMODERN LITERATURE was JOSEPH WARTON;--he had a fragmentary mind, and he\r\nwas a rambler in discursive criticism. Dr. JOHNSON was a famished man\r\nfor anecdotical literature, and sorely complained of the penury of our\r\nliterary history.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WARTON must have found, in the taste of his brother and the\r\nenergy of Johnson, his happiest prototypes; but he had too frequently to\r\nwrestle with barren antiquarianism, and was lost to us at the gates of\r\nthat paradise which had hardly opened on him. These were the true\r\nfounders of that more elegant literature in which France had preceded\r\nus. These works created a more pleasing species of erudition:--the age\r\nof taste and genius had come; but the age of philosophical thinking was\r\nyet but in its dawn.\r\n\r\nAmong my earliest literary friends, two distinguished themselves by\r\ntheir anecdotical literature: JAMES PETIT ANDREWS, by his \"Anecdotes,\r\nAncient and Modern,\" and WILLIAM SEWARD, by his \"Anecdotes of\r\nDistinguished Persons.\" These volumes were favourably received, and to\r\nsuch a degree, that a wit of that day, and who is still a wit as well as\r\na poet, considered that we were far gone in our \"Anecdotage.\"\r\n\r\nI was a guest at the banquet, but it seemed to me to consist wholly of\r\nconfectionery. I conceived the idea of a collection of a different\r\ncomplexion. I was then seeking for instruction in modern literature; and\r\nour language afforded no collection of the _res litterariæ_. In the\r\ndiversified volumes of the French _Ana_, I found, among the best,\r\nmaterials to work on. I improved my subjects with as much of our own\r\nliterature as my limited studies afforded. The volume, without a name,\r\nwas left to its own unprotected condition. I had not miscalculated the\r\nwants of others by my own.\r\n\r\nThis first volume had reminded the learned of much which it is grateful\r\nto remember, and those who were restricted by their classical studies,\r\nor lounged only in perishable novelties, were in modern literature but\r\ndry wells, for which I had opened clear waters from a fresh spring. The\r\nwork had effected its design in stimulating the literary curiosity of\r\nthose, who, with a taste for its tranquil pursuits, are impeded in their\r\nacquirement. Imitations were numerous. My reading became more various,\r\nand the second volume of \"Curiosities of Literature\" appeared, with a\r\nslight effort at more original investigation. The two brother volumes\r\nremained favourites during an interval of twenty years.\r\n\r\nIt was as late as 1817 that I sent forth the third volume; without a\r\nword of preface. I had no longer anxieties to conceal or promises to\r\nperform. The subjects chosen were novel, and investigated with more\r\noriginal composition. The motto prefixed to this third volume from the\r\nMarquis of Halifax is lost in the republications, but expresses the\r\npeculiar delight of all literary researches for those who love them:\r\n\"The struggling for knowledge hath a pleasure in it like that of\r\nwrestling with a fine woman.\"\r\n\r\nThe notice which the third volume obtained, returned me to the dream of\r\nmy youth. I considered that essay writing, from Addison to the\r\nsuccessors of Johnson, which had formed one of the most original\r\nfeatures of our national literature, would now fail in its attraction,\r\neven if some of those elegant writers themselves had appeared in a form\r\nwhich their own excellence had rendered familiar and deprived of all\r\nnovelty. I was struck by an observation which Johnson has thrown out.\r\nThat sage, himself an essayist and who had lived among our essayists,\r\nfancied that \"mankind may come in time to write all aphoristically;\" and\r\nso athirst was that first of our great moral biographers for the details\r\nof human life and the incidental characteristics of individuals, that he\r\nwas desirous of obtaining anecdotes without preparation or connexion.\r\n\"If a man,\" said this lover of literary anecdotes, \"is to wait till he\r\nweaves anecdotes, we may be long in getting them, and get but few in\r\ncomparison to what we might get.\" Another observation, of Lord\r\nBolingbroke, had long dwelt in my mind, that \"when examples are pointed\r\nout to us, there is a kind of appeal with which we are flattered made to\r\nour senses as well as our understandings.\" An induction from a variety\r\nof particulars seemed to me to combine that delight, which Johnson\r\nderived from anecdotes, with that philosophy which Bolingbroke founded\r\non examples; and on this principle the last three volumes of the\r\n\"Curiosities of Literature\" were constructed, freed from the formality\r\nof dissertation, and the vagueness of the lighter essay.\r\n\r\nThese \"Curiosities of Literature\" have passed through a remarkable\r\nordeal of time; they have survived a generation of rivals; they are\r\nfound wherever books are bought, and they have been repeatedly reprinted\r\nat foreign presses, as well as translated. These volumes have imbued our\r\nyouth with their first tastes for modern literature, have diffused a\r\ndelight in critical and philosophical speculation among circles of\r\nreaders who were not accustomed to literary topics; and finally, they\r\nhave been honoured by eminent contemporaries, who have long consulted\r\nthem and set their stamp on the metal.\r\n\r\nA voluminous miscellany, composed at various periods, cannot be exempt\r\nfrom slight inadvertencies. Such a circuit of multifarious knowledge\r\ncould not be traced were we to measure and count each step by some\r\ncritical pedometer; life would be too short to effect any reasonable\r\nprogress. Every work must be judged by its design, and is to be valued\r\nby its result.\r\n\r\n  BRADENHAM HOUSE,\r\n\r\n  _March_, 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIBRARIES

curiosity; but long it required regal\r\nmunificence to found a national library. It is only since the art of\r\nmultiplying the productions of the mind has been discovered, that men of\r\nletters themselves have been enabled to rival this imperial and\r\npatriotic honour. The taste for books, so rare before the fifteenth\r\ncentury, has gradually become general only within these four hundred\r\nyears: in that small space of time the public mind of Europe has been\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nOf LIBRARIES, the following anecdotes seem most interesting, as they\r\nmark either the affection, or the veneration, which civilised men have\r\never felt for these perennial repositories of their minds. The first\r\nnational library founded in Egypt seemed to have been placed under the\r\nprotection of the divinities, for their statues magnificently adorned\r\nthis temple, dedicated at once to religion and to literature. It was\r\nstill further embellished by a well-known inscription, for ever grateful\r\nto the votary of literature; on the front was engraven,--\"The\r\nnourishment of the soul;\" or, according to Diodorus, \"The medicine of\r\nthe mind.\"\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Ptolemies founded the vast library of Alexandria, which was\r\nafterwards the emulative labour of rival monarchs; the founder infused a\r\nsoul into the vast body he was creating, by his choice of the librarian,\r\nDemetrius Phalereus, whose skilful industry amassed from all nations\r\ntheir choicest productions. Without such a librarian, a national library\r\nwould be little more than a literary chaos; his well exercised memory\r\nand critical judgment are its best catalogue. One of the Ptolemies\r\nrefused supplying the famished Athenians with wheat, until they\r\npresented him with the original manuscripts of Æschylus, Sophocles, and\r\nEuripides; and in returning copies of these autographs, he allowed them\r\nto retain the fifteen talents which he had pledged with them as a\r\nprincely security.\r\n\r\nWhen tyrants, or usurpers, have possessed sense as well as courage, they\r\nhave proved the most ardent patrons of literature; they know it is their\r\ninterest to turn aside the public mind from political speculations, and\r\nto afford their subjects the inexhaustible occupations of curiosity, and\r\nthe consoling pleasures of the imagination. Thus Pisistratus is said to\r\nhave been among the earliest of the Greeks, who projected an immense\r\ncollection of the works of the learned, and is supposed to have been the\r\ncollector of the scattered works, which passed under the name of Homer.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, after six centuries of gradual dominion, must have possessed\r\nthe vast and diversified collections of the writings of the nations they\r\nconquered: among the most valued spoils of their victories, we know that\r\nmanuscripts were considered as more precious than vases of gold. Paulus\r\nEmilius, after the defeat of Perseus, king of Macedon, brought to Rome a\r\ngreat number which he had amassed in Greece, and which he now\r\ndistributed among his sons, or presented to the Roman people. Sylla\r\nfollowed his example. Alter the siege of Athens, he discovered an entire\r\nlibrary in the temple of Apollo, which having carried to Rome, he\r\nappears to have been the founder of the first Roman public library.\r\nAfter the taking of Carthage, the Roman senate rewarded the family of\r\nRegulus with the books found in that city. A library was a national\r\ngift, and the most honourable they could bestow. From the intercourse of\r\nthe Romans with the Greeks, the passion for forming libraries rapidly\r\nincreased, and individuals began to pride themselves on their private\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nOf many illustrious Romans, their magnificent taste in their _libraries_\r\nhas been recorded. Asinius Pollio, Crassus, Cæsar, and Cicero, have,\r\namong others, been celebrated for their literary splendor. Lucullus,\r\nwhose incredible opulence exhausted itself on more than imperial\r\nluxuries, more honourably distinguished himself by his vast collections\r\nof books, and the happy use he made of them by the liberal access he\r\nallowed the learned. \"It was a library,\" says Plutarch, \"whose walks,\r\ngalleries, and cabinets, were open to all visitors; and the ingenious\r\nGreeks, when at leisure, resorted to this abode of the Muses to hold\r\nliterary conversations, in which Lucullus himself loved to join.\" This\r\nlibrary enlarged by others, Julius Cæsar once proposed to open for the\r\npublic, having chosen the erudite Varro for its librarian; but the\r\ndaggers of Brutus and his party prevented the meditated projects of\r\nCæsar. In this museum, Cicero frequently pursued his studies, during the\r\ntime his friend Faustus had the charge of it; which he describes to\r\nAtticus in his 4th Book, Epist. 9. Amidst his public occupations and his\r\nprivate studies, either of them sufficient to have immortalised one man,\r\nwe are astonished at the minute attention Cicero paid to the formation\r\nof his libraries and his cabinets of antiquities.\r\n\r\nThe emperors were ambitious, at length, to give _their names_ to the\r\n_libraries_ they founded; they did not consider the purple as their\r\nchief ornament. Augustus was himself an author; and to one of those\r\nsumptuous buildings, called _Thermæ_, ornamented with porticos,\r\ngalleries, and statues, with shady walks, and refreshing baths,\r\ntestified his love of literature by adding a magnificent library. One of\r\nthese libraries he fondly called by the name of his sister Octavia; and\r\nthe other, the temple of Apollo, became the haunt of the poets, as\r\nHorace, Juvenal, and Persius have commemorated. The successors of\r\nAugustus imitated his example, and even Tiberius had an imperial\r\nlibrary, chiefly consisting of works concerning the empire and the acts\r\nof its sovereigns. These Trajan augmented by the Ulpian library,\r\ndenominated from his family name. In a word, we have accounts of the\r\nrich ornaments the ancients bestowed on their libraries; of their floors\r\npaved with marble, their walls covered with glass and ivory, and their\r\nshelves and desks of ebony and cedar.\r\n\r\nThe first _public library_ in Italy was founded by a person of no\r\nconsiderable fortune: his credit, his frugality, and fortitude, were\r\nindeed equal to a treasury. Nicholas Niccoli, the son of a merchant,\r\nafter the death of his father relinquished the beaten roads of gain, and\r\ndevoted his soul to study, and his fortune to assist students. At his\r\ndeath, he left his library to the public, but his debts exceeding his\r\neffects, the princely generosity of Cosmo de' Medici realised the\r\nintention of its former possessor, and afterwards enriched it by the\r\naddition of an apartment, in which he placed the Greek, Hebrew, Arabic,\r\nChaldaic, and Indian MSS. The intrepid spirit of Nicholas V. laid the\r\nfoundations of the Vatican; the affection of Cardinal Bessarion for his\r\ncountry first gave Venice the rudiments of a public library; and to Sir\r\nT. Bodley we owe the invaluable one of Oxford. Sir Robert Cotton, Sir\r\nHans Sloane, Dr. Birch, Mr. Cracherode, Mr. Douce, and others of this\r\nrace of lovers of books, have all contributed to form these literary\r\ntreasures, which our nation owe to the enthusiasm of individuals, who\r\nhave consecrated their fortunes and their days to this great public\r\nobject; or, which in the result produces the same public good, the\r\ncollections of such men have been frequently purchased on their deaths,\r\nby government, and thus have been preserved entire in our national\r\ncollections.[5]\r\n\r\nLITERATURE, like virtue, is often its own reward, and the enthusiasm\r\nsome experience in the permanent enjoyments of a vast library has far\r\noutweighed the neglect or the calumny of the world, which some of its\r\nvotaries have received. From the time that Cicero poured forth his\r\nfeelings in his oration for the poet Archias, innumerable are the\r\ntestimonies of men of letters of the pleasurable delirium of their\r\nresearches. Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, and Chancellor of England\r\nso early as 1341, perhaps raised the first private library in our\r\ncountry. He purchased thirty or forty volumes of the Abbot of St. Albans\r\nfor fifty pounds' weight of silver. He was so enamoured of his large\r\ncollection, that he expressly composed a treatise on his love of books,\r\nunder the title of _Philobiblion_; and which has been recently\r\ntranslated.[6]\r\n\r\nHe who passes much of his time amid such vast resources, and does not\r\naspire to make some small addition to his library, were it only by a\r\ncritical catalogue, must indeed be not more animated than a leaden\r\nMercury. He must be as indolent as that animal called the Sloth, who\r\nperishes on the tree he climbs, after he has eaten all its leaves.\r\n\r\nRantzau, the founder of the great library at Copenhagen, whose days were\r\ndissolved in the pleasures of reading, discovers his taste and ardour in\r\nthe following elegant effusion:--\r\n\r\n    Salvete aureoli mei libelli,\r\n    Meæ deliciæ, mei lepores!\r\n    Quam vos sæpe oculis juvat videre,\r\n    Et tritos manibus tenere nostris!\r\n    Tot vos eximii, tot eruditi,\r\n    Prisci lumina sæculi et recentis,\r\n    Confecere viri, suasque vobis\r\n    Ausi credere lucubrationes:\r\n    Et sperare decus perenne scriptis;\r\n    Neque hæc irrita spes fefellit illos.\r\n\r\n    IMITATED.\r\n\r\n    Golden volumes! richest treasures!\r\n    Objects of delicious pleasures!\r\n    You my eyes rejoicing please,\r\n    You my hands in rapture seize!\r\n    Brilliant wits, and musing sages,\r\n    Lights who beamed through many ages,\r\n    Left to your conscious leaves their story,\r\n    And dared to trust you with their glory;\r\n    And now their hope of fame achieved,\r\n    Dear volumes! you have not deceived!\r\n\r\nThis passion for the enjoyment of _books_ has occasioned their lovers\r\nembellishing their outsides with costly ornaments;[7] a fancy which\r\nostentation may have abused; but when these volumes belong to the real\r\nman of letters, the most fanciful bindings are often the emblems of his\r\ntaste and feelings. The great Thuanus procured the finest copies for his\r\nlibrary, and his volumes are still eagerly purchased, bearing his\r\nautograph on the last page. A celebrated amateur was Grollier; the Muses\r\nthemselves could not more ingeniously have ornamented their favourite\r\nworks. I have seen several in the libraries of curious collectors. They\r\nare gilded and stamped with peculiar neatness; the compartments on the\r\nbinding are drawn, and painted, with subjects analogous to the works\r\nthemselves; and they are further adorned by that amiable inscription,\r\n_Jo. Grollierii et amicorum!_--purporting that these literary treasures\r\nwere collected for himself and for his friends.\r\n\r\nThe family of the Fuggers had long felt an hereditary passion for the\r\naccumulation of literary treasures: and their portraits, with others in\r\ntheir picture gallery, form a curious quarto volume of 127 portraits,\r\nrare even in Germany, entitled \"Fuggerorum Pinacotheca.\"[8] Wolfius, who\r\ndaily haunted their celebrated library, pours out his gratitude in some\r\nGreek verses, and describes this bibliothèque as a literary heaven,\r\nfurnished with as many books as there were stars in the firmament; or as\r\na literary garden, in which he passed entire days in gathering fruit and\r\nflowers, delighting and instructing himself by perpetual occupation.\r\n\r\nIn 1364, the royal library of France did not exceed twenty volumes.\r\nShortly after, Charles V. increased it to 900, which, by the fate of\r\nwar, as much at least as by that of money, the Duke of Bedford\r\nafterwards purchased and transported to London, where libraries were\r\nsmaller than on the continent, about 1440. It is a circumstance worthy\r\nobservation, that the French sovereign, Charles V. surnamed the Wise,\r\nordered that thirty portable lights, with a silver lamp suspended from\r\nthe centre, should be illuminated at night, that students might not find\r\ntheir pursuits interrupted at any hour. Many among us, at this moment,\r\nwhose professional avocations admit not of morning studies, find that\r\nthe resources of a public library are not accessible to them, from the\r\nomission of the regulation of the zealous Charles V. of France. An\r\nobjection to night-studies in public libraries is the danger of fire,\r\nand in our own British Museum not a light is permitted to be carried\r\nabout on any pretence whatever. The history of the \"Bibliothèque du Roi\"\r\nis a curious incident in literature; and the progress of the human mind\r\nand public opinion might be traced by its gradual accessions, noting the\r\nchangeable qualities of its literary stores chiefly from theology, law,\r\nand medicine, to philosophy and elegant literature. It was first under\r\nLouis XIV. that the productions of the art of engraving were there\r\ncollected and arranged; the great minister Colbert purchased the\r\nextensive collections of the Abbé de Marolles, who may be ranked among\r\nthe fathers of our print-collectors. Two hundred and sixty-four ample\r\nportfolios laid the foundations, and the very catalogues of his\r\ncollections, printed by Marolles himself, are rare and high-priced. Our\r\nown national print gallery is growing from its infant establishment.\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam has observed, that in 1440, England had made comparatively\r\nbut little progress in learning--and Germany was probably still less\r\nadvanced. However, in Germany, Trithemius, the celebrated abbot of\r\nSpanheim, who died in 1516, had amassed about two thousand manuscripts;\r\na literary treasure which excited such general attention, that princes\r\nand eminent men travelled to visit Trithemius and his library. About\r\nthis time, six or eight hundred volumes formed a royal collection, and\r\ntheir cost could only be furnished by a prince. This was indeed a great\r\nadvancement in libraries, for at the beginning of the fourteenth century\r\nthe library of Louis IX. contained only four classical authors; and that\r\nof Oxford, in 1300, consisted of \"a few tracts kept in chests.\"\r\n\r\nThe pleasures of study are classed by Burton among those exercises or\r\nrecreations of the mind which pass _within doors_. Looking about this\r\n\"world of books,\" he exclaims, \"I could even live and die with such\r\nmeditations, and take more delight and true content of mind in them than\r\nin all thy wealth and sport! There is a sweetness, which, as Circe's\r\ncup, bewitcheth a student: he cannot leave off, as well may witness\r\nthose many laborious hours, days, and nights, spent in their voluminous\r\ntreatises. So sweet is the delight of study. The last day is _prioris\r\ndiscipulus_. Heinsius was mewed up in the library of Leyden all the year\r\nlong, and that which, to my thinking, should have bred a loathing,\r\ncaused in him a greater liking. 'I no sooner,' saith he, 'come into the\r\nlibrary, but I bolt the door to me, excluding Lust, Ambition, Avarice,\r\nand all such vices, whose nurse is Idleness, the mother of Ignorance and\r\nMelancholy. In the very lap of eternity, amongst so many divine souls, I\r\ntake my seat with so lofty a spirit, and sweet content, that I pity all\r\nour great ones and rich men, that know not this happiness.'\" Such is the\r\nincense of a votary who scatters it on the altar less for the ceremony\r\nthan from the devotion.[9]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, an intemperance in study, incompatible often with our\r\nsocial or more active duties. The illustrious Grotius exposed himself to\r\nthe reproaches of some of his contemporaries for having too warmly\r\npursued his studies, to the detriment of his public station. It was the\r\nboast of Cicero that his philosophical studies had never interfered with\r\nthe services he owed the republic, and that he had only dedicated to\r\nthem the hours which others give to their walks, their repasts, and\r\ntheir pleasures. Looking on his voluminous labours, we are surprised at\r\nthis observation;--how honourable is it to him, that his various\r\nphilosophical works bear the titles of the different villas he\r\npossessed, which indicates that they were composed in these respective\r\nretirements! Cicero must have been an early riser; and practised that\r\nmagic art in the employment of time, which multiplies our days.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The Cottonian collection is the richest English historic\r\nlibrary we possess, and is now located in the British Museum, having\r\nbeen purchased for the use of the nation by Parliament in 1707, at a\r\ncost of 4500_l._ The collection of Sir Hans Sloane was added thereto in\r\n1753, for the sum of 20,000_l._ Dr. Birch and Mr. Cracherode bequeathed\r\ntheir most valuable collections to the British Museum. Mr. Douce is the\r\nonly collector in the list above who bequeathed his curious gatherings\r\nelsewhere. He was an officer of the Museum for many years, but preferred\r\nto leave his treasures to the Bodleian Library, where they are preserved\r\nintact, according to his earnest wish, a wish he feared might not be\r\ngratified in the national building. It is to this scholar and friend,\r\nthe author of these volumes has dedicated them, as a lasting memorial of\r\nan esteem which endured during the life of each.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: By Mr. Inglis, in 1832. This famous bishop is said to have\r\npossessed more books than all the others in England put together. Like\r\nMagliabechi, he lived among them, and those who visited him had to\r\ndispense with ceremony and step over the volumes that always strewed his\r\nfloor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The earliest decorated books were the Consular Diptycha,\r\nivory bookcovers richly sculptured in relief, and destined to contain\r\nupon their tablets the Fasti Consulares, the list ending with the name\r\nof the new consul, whose property they happened to be. Such as have\r\ndescended to our own times appear to be works of the lower empire. They\r\nwere generally decorated with full length figures of the consul and\r\nattendants, superintending the sports of the circus, or conjoined with\r\nportraits of the reigning prince and emblematic figures. The Greek\r\nChurch adopted the style for the covers of the sacred volume, and\r\nancient clerical libraries formerly possessed many such specimens of\r\nearly bookbinding; the covers being richly sculptured in ivory, with\r\nbas-reliefs designed from Scripture history. Such ivories were sometimes\r\nplaced in the centre of the covers, and framed in an ornamental\r\nmetal-work studded with precious stones and engraved cameos. The\r\nbarbaric magnificence of these volumes has never been surpassed; the era\r\nof Charlemagne was the culmination of their glory. One such volume,\r\npresented by that sovereign to the Cathedral at Treves, is enriched with\r\nRoman ivories and decorative gems. The value of manuscripts in the\r\nmiddle ages, suggested costly bindings for books that consumed the\r\nlabour of lives to copy, and decorate with ornamental letters, or\r\nillustrative paintings. In the fifteenth century covers of leather\r\nembossed with storied ornament were in use; ladies also frequently\r\nemployed their needles to construct, with threads of gold and silver, on\r\ngrounds of coloured silk, the cover of a favourite volume. In the\r\nBritish Museum one is preserved of a later date--the work of our Queen\r\nElizabeth. In the sixteenth century small ornaments, capable of being\r\nconjoined into a variety of elaborate patterns, were first used for\r\nstamping the covers with gilding; the leather was stained of various\r\ntints, and a beauty imparted to volumes which has not been surpassed by\r\nthe most skilful modern workmen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The Fuggers were a rich family of merchants, residing at\r\nAugsburg, carrying on trade with both the Indies, and from thence over\r\nEurope.

Their motley libraries have been called the\r\n_madhouses of the Human mind_; and again, _the tomb of books_, when the\r\npossessor will not communicate them, and coffins them up in the cases of\r\nhis library. It was facetiously observed, these collections are not\r\nwithout a _Lock on the Human Understanding_.[10]\r\n\r\nThe BIBLIOMANIA never raged more violently than in our own times. It is\r\nfortunate that literature is in no ways injured by the follies of\r\ncollectors, since though they preserve the worthless, they necessarily\r\nprotect the good.[11]\r\n\r\nSome collectors place all their fame on the _view_ of a splendid\r\nlibrary, where volumes, arrayed in all the pomp of lettering, silk\r\nlinings, triple gold bands, and tinted leather, are locked up in wire\r\ncases, and secured from the vulgar hands of the _mere reader_, dazzling\r\nour eyes like eastern beauties peering through their jalousies!\r\n\r\nLA BRUYERE has touched on this mania with humour:--\"Of such a collector,\r\nas soon as I enter his house, I am ready to faint on the staircase, from\r\na strong smell of Morocco leather. In vain he shows me fine editions,\r\ngold leaves, Etruscan bindings, and naming them one after another, as if\r\nhe were showing a gallery of pictures! a gallery, by-the-bye, which he\r\nseldom traverses when _alone_, for he rarely reads; but me he offers to\r\nconduct through it! I thank him for his politeness, and as little as\r\nhimself care to visit the tan-house, which he calls his library.\"\r\n\r\nLUCIAN has composed a biting invective against an ignorant possessor of\r\na vast library, like him, who in the present day, after turning over the\r\npages of an old book, chiefly admires the _date_. LUCIAN compares him to\r\na pilot, who was never taught the science of navigation; to a rider who\r\ncannot keep his seat on a spirited horse; to a man who, not having the\r\nuse of his feet, would conceal the defect by wearing embroidered shoes;\r\nbut, alas! he cannot stand in them! He ludicrously compares him to\r\nThersites wearing the armour of Achilles, tottering at every step;\r\nleering with his little eyes under his enormous helmet, and his\r\nhunchback raising the cuirass above his shoulders. Why do you buy so\r\nmany books? You have no hair, and you purchase a comb; you are blind,\r\nand you will have a grand mirror; you are deaf, and you will have fine\r\nmusical instruments! Your costly bindings are only a source of vexation,\r\nand you are continually discharging your librarians for not preserving\r\nthem from the silent invasion of the worms, and the nibbling triumphs of\r\nthe rats!\r\n\r\nSuch _collectors_ will contemptuously smile at the _collection_ of the\r\namiable Melancthon. He possessed in his library only four\r\nauthors,--Plato, Pliny, Plutarch, and Ptolemy the geographer.\r\n\r\nAncillon was a great collector of curious books, and dexterously\r\ndefended himself when accused of the _Bibliomania_. He gave a good\r\nreason for buying the most elegant editions; which he did not consider\r\nmerely as a literary luxury.[12] The less the eyes are fatigued in\r\nreading a work, the more liberty the mind feels to judge of it: and as\r\nwe perceive more clearly the excellences and defects of a printed book\r\nthan when in MS.; so we see them more plainly in good paper and clear\r\ntype, than when the impression and paper are both bad. He always\r\npurchased _first editions_, and never waited for second ones; though it\r\nis the opinion of some that a first edition is only to be considered as\r\nan imperfect essay, which the author proposes to finish after he has\r\ntried the sentiments of the literary world. Bayle approves of Ancillon's\r\nplan. Those who wait for a book till it is reprinted, show plainly that\r\nthey prefer the saving of a pistole to the acquisition of knowledge.\r\nWith one of these persons, who waited for a second edition, which never\r\nappeared, a literary man argued, that it was better to have two editions\r\nof a book rather than to deprive himself of the advantage which the\r\nreading of the first might procure him. It has frequently happened,\r\nbesides, that in second editions, the author omits, as well as adds, or\r\nmakes alterations from prudential reasons; the displeasing truths which\r\nhe _corrects_, as he might call them, are so many losses incurred by\r\nTruth itself. There is an advantage in comparing the first and\r\nsubsequent editions; among other things, we feel great satisfaction in\r\ntracing the variations of a work after its revision. There are also\r\nother secrets, well known to the intelligent curious, who are versed in\r\naffairs relating to books. Many first editions are not to be purchased\r\nfor the treble value of later ones. The collector we have noticed\r\nfrequently said, as is related of Virgil, \"I collect gold from Ennius's\r\ndung.\" I find, in some neglected authors, particular things, not\r\nelsewhere to be found. He read many of these, but not with equal\r\nattention--\"_Sicut canis ad Nilum, bibens et fugiens_;\" like a dog at\r\nthe Nile, drinking and running.\r\n\r\nFortunate are those who only consider a book for the utility and\r\npleasure they may derive from its possession. Students, who know much,\r\nand still thirst to know more, may require this vast sea of books; yet\r\nin that sea they may suffer many shipwrecks.\r\n\r\nGreat collections of books are subject to certain accidents besides the\r\ndamp, the worms, and the rats; one not less common is that of the\r\n_borrowers_, not to say a word of the _purloiners_!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: An allusion and pun which occasioned the French\r\ntranslator of the present work an unlucky blunder: puzzled, no\r\ndoubt, by my _facetiously_, he translates \"mettant, comme on l'a\r\n_trés-judicieusement_ fait observer, l'entendement humain sous la clef.\"\r\nThe great work and the great author alluded to, having quite escaped\r\nhim!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The earliest satire on the mere book-collector is to be\r\nfound in Barclay's translation of Brandt's \"Ship of Fools,\" first\r\nprinted by Wynkyn de Worde, in 1508. He thus announces his true\r\nposition:--\r\n\r\n    I am the first fool of the whole navie\r\n    To keepe the poupe, the helme, and eke the sayle:\r\n    For this is my minde, this one pleasure have I,\r\n    Of bookes to have greate plentie and apparayle.\r\n    Still I am busy bookes assembling,\r\n    For to have plenty it is a pleasaunt thing\r\n    In my conceyt, and to have them aye in hande:\r\n    But what they meane do I not understande.\r\n    But yet I have them in great reverence\r\n    And honoure, saving them from filth and ordare,\r\n    By often brushing and much diligence;\r\n    Full goodly bound in pleasaunt coverture,\r\n    Of damas, satten, or else of velvet pure:\r\n    I keepe them sure, fearing least they should be lost,\r\n    For in them is the cunning wherein I me boast.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: David Ancillon was born at Metz in 1617. From his earliest\r\nyears his devotion to study was so great as to call for the\r\ninterposition of his father, to prevent his health being seriously\r\naffected by it; he was described as \"intemperately studious.\" The\r\nJesuits of Metz gave him the free range of their college library; but\r\nhis studies led him to Protestantism, and in 1633 he removed to Geneva,\r\nand devoted himself to the duties of the Reformed Church. Throughout an\r\nhonourable life he retained unabated his love of books; and having a\r\nfortune by marriage, he gratified himself in constantly collecting them,\r\nso that he ultimately possessed one of the finest private libraries in\r\nFrance. For very many years his life passed peaceably and happily amid\r\nhis books and his duties, when the revocation of the Edict of Nantes\r\ndrove him from his country. His noble library was scattered at\r\nwaste-paper prices, \"thus in a single day was destroyed the labour,\r\ncare, and expense of forty-four years.\" He died seven years afterwards\r\nat Brandenburg.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY JOURNALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen writers were not numerous, and readers rare, the unsuccessful\r\nauthor fell insensibly into oblivion; he dissolved away in his own\r\nweakness. If he committed the private folly of printing what no one\r\nwould purchase, he was not arraigned at the public tribunal--and the\r\nawful terrors of his day of judgment consisted only in the retributions\r\nof his publisher's final accounts. At length, a taste for literature\r\nspread through the body of the people; vanity induced the inexperienced\r\nand the ignorant to aspire to literary honours. To oppose these forcible\r\nentries into the haunts of the Muses, periodical criticism brandished\r\nits formidable weapon; and the fall of many, taught some of our greatest\r\ngeniuses to rise. Multifarious writings produced multifarious\r\nstrictures; and public criticism reached to such perfection, that taste\r\nwas generally diffused, enlightening those whose occupations had\r\notherwise never permitted them to judge of literary compositions.\r\n\r\nThe invention of REVIEWS, in the form which they have at length\r\ngradually assumed, could not have existed but in the most polished ages\r\nof literature: for without a constant supply of authors, and a refined\r\nspirit of criticism, they could not excite a perpetual interest among\r\nthe lovers of literature. These publications were long the chronicles of\r\ntaste and science, presenting the existing state of the public mind,\r\nwhile they formed a ready resource for those idle hours, which men of\r\nletters would not pass idly.\r\n\r\nTheir multiplicity has undoubtedly produced much evil; puerile critics\r\nand venal drudges manufacture reviews; hence that shameful discordance\r\nof opinion, which is the scorn and scandal of criticism. Passions\r\nhostile to the peaceful truths of literature have likewise made\r\ntremendous inroads in the republic, and every literary virtue has been\r\nlost! In \"Calamities of Authors\" I have given the history of a literary\r\nconspiracy, conducted by a solitary critic, GILBERT STUART, against the\r\nhistorian HENRY.\r\n\r\nThese works may disgust by vapid panegyric, or gross invective; weary\r\nby uniform dulness, or tantalise by superficial knowledge. Sometimes\r\nmerely written to catch the public attention, a malignity is indulged\r\nagainst authors, to season the caustic leaves. A reviewer has admired\r\nthose works in private, which he has condemned in his official capacity.\r\nBut good sense, good temper, and good taste, will ever form an estimable\r\njournalist, who will inspire confidence, and give stability to his\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\nTo the lovers of literature these volumes, when they have outlived their\r\nyear, are not unimportant. They constitute a great portion of literary\r\nhistory, and are indeed the annals of the republic.\r\n\r\nTo our own reviews, we must add the old foreign journals, which are\r\nperhaps even more valuable to the man of letters. Of these the variety\r\nis considerable; and many of their writers are now known. They delight\r\nour curiosity by opening new views, and light up in observing minds many\r\nprojects of works, wanted in our own literature. GIBBON feasted on them;\r\nand while he turned them over with constant pleasure, derived accurate\r\nnotions of works, which no student could himself have verified; of many\r\nworks a notion is sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe origin of literary journals was the happy project of DENIS DE SALLO,\r\na counsellor in the parliament of Paris. In 1665 appeared his _Journal\r\ndes Sçavans_. He published his essay in the name of the Sieur de\r\nHedouville, his footman! Was this a mere stroke of humour, or designed\r\nto insinuate that the freedom of criticism could only be allowed to his\r\nlacquey? The work, however, met with so favourable a reception, that\r\nSALLO had the satisfaction of seeing it, the following year, imitated\r\nthroughout Europe, and his Journal, at the same time, translated into\r\nvarious languages. But as most authors lay themselves open to an acute\r\ncritic, the animadversions of SALLO were given with such asperity of\r\ncriticism, and such malignity of wit, that this new journal excited loud\r\nmurmurs, and the most heart-moving complaints. The learned had their\r\nplagiarisms detected, and the wit had his claims disputed. Sarasin\r\ncalled the gazettes of this new Aristarchus, Hebdomadary Flams!\r\n_Billevesées hebdomadaires!_ and Menage having published a law book,\r\nwhich Sallo had treated with severe raillery, he entered into a long\r\nargument to prove, according to Justinian, that a lawyer is not allowed\r\nto defame another lawyer, &c.: _Senatori maledicere non licet,\r\nremaledicere jus fasque est_. Others loudly declaimed against this new\r\nspecies of imperial tyranny, and this attempt to regulate the public\r\nopinion by that of an individual. Sallo, after having published only his\r\nthird volume, felt the irritated wasps of literature thronging so thick\r\nabout him, that he very gladly abdicated the throne of criticism. The\r\njournal is said to have suffered a short interruption by a remonstrance\r\nfrom the nuncio of the pope, for the energy with which Sallo had\r\ndefended the liberties of the Gallican church.\r\n\r\nIntimidated by the fate of SALLO, his successor, the Abbé GALLOIS,\r\nflourished in a milder reign. He contented himself with giving the\r\ntitles of books, accompanied with extracts; and he was more useful than\r\ninteresting. The public, who had been so much amused by the raillery and\r\nseverity of the founder of this dynasty of new critics, now murmured at\r\nthe want of that salt and acidity by which they had relished the\r\nfugitive collation. They were not satisfied with having the most\r\nbeautiful, or the most curious parts of a new work brought together;\r\nthey wished for the unreasonable entertainment of railing and raillery.\r\nAt length another objection was conjured up against the review;\r\nmathematicians complained that they were neglected to make room for\r\nexperiments in natural philosophy; the historian sickened over works of\r\nnatural history; the antiquaries would have nothing but discoveries of\r\nMSS. or fragments of antiquity. Medical works were called for by one\r\nparty, and reprobated by another. In a word, each reader wished only to\r\nhave accounts of books, which were interesting to his profession or his\r\ntaste. But a review is a work presented to the public at large, and\r\nwritten for more than one country. In spite of all these difficulties,\r\nthis work was carried to a vast extent. An _index_ to the _Journal des\r\nSçavans_ has been arranged on a critical plan, occupying ten volumes in\r\nquarto, which may be considered as a most useful instrument to obtain\r\nthe science and literature of the entire century.\r\n\r\nThe next celebrated reviewer is BAYLE, who undertook, in 1684, his\r\n_Nouvelles de la République des Lettres_. He possessed the art, acquired\r\nby habit, of reading a book by his fingers, as it has been happily\r\nexpressed; and of comprising, in concise extracts, a just notion of a\r\nbook, without the addition of irrelevant matter. Lively, neat, and full\r\nof that attic salt which gives a relish to the driest disquisitions,\r\nfor the first time the ladies and all the _beau-monde_ took an interest\r\nin the labours of the critic. He wreathed the rod of criticism with\r\nroses. Yet even BAYLE, who declared himself to be a reporter, and not a\r\njudge, BAYLE, the discreet sceptic, could not long satisfy his readers.\r\nHis panegyric was thought somewhat prodigal; his fluency of style\r\nsomewhat too familiar; and others affected not to relish his gaiety. In\r\nhis latter volumes, to still the clamour, he assumed the cold sobriety\r\nof an historian: and has bequeathed no mean legacy to the literary\r\nworld, in thirty-six small volumes of criticism, closed in 1687. These\r\nwere continued by Bernard, with inferior skill; and by Basnage more\r\nsuccessfully, in his _Histoire des Ouvrages des Sçavans_.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary and the antagonist of BAYLE was LE CLERC. His firm\r\nindustry has produced three _Bibliothèques_--_Universelle et\r\nHistorique_, _Choisie_, and _Ancienne et Moderne_; forming in all\r\neighty-two volumes, which, complete, bear a high price. Inferior to\r\nBAYLE in the more pleasing talents, he is perhaps superior in erudition,\r\nand shows great skill in analysis: but his hand drops no flowers! GIBBON\r\nresorted to Le Clerc's volumes at his leisure, \"as an inexhaustible\r\nsource of amusement and instruction.\" Apostolo Zeno's _Giornale del\r\nLitterati d'Italia_, from 1710 to 1733, is valuable.\r\n\r\nBEAUSOBRE and L'ENFANT, two learned Protestants, wrote a _Bibliothèque\r\nGermanique_, from 1720 to 1740, in 50 volumes. Our own literature is\r\ninterested by the \"_Bibliothèque Britannique_,\" written by some literary\r\nFrenchmen, noticed by La Croze, in his \"Voyage Littéraire,\" who\r\ndesignates the writers in this most tantalising manner: \"Les auteurs\r\nsont gens de mérite, et qui entendent tous parfaitement l'Anglois;\r\nMessrs. S.B., le M.D., et le savant Mr. D.\" Posterity has been partially\r\nlet into the secret: De Missy was one of the contributors, and Warburton\r\ncommunicated his project of an edition of Velleius Patereulus. This\r\nuseful account of English books begins in 1733, and closes in 1747,\r\nHague, 23 vols.: to this we must add the _Journal Britannique_, in 18\r\nvols., by Dr. MATY, a foreign physician residing in London; this Journal\r\nexhibits a view of the state of English literature from 1750 to 1755.\r\nGIBBON bestows a high character on the journalist, who sometimes\r\n\"aspires to the character of a poet and a philosopher; one of the last\r\ndisciples of the school of Fontenelle.\"\r\n\r\nMATY'S son produced here a review known to the curious, his style and\r\ndecisions often discover haste and heat, with some striking\r\nobservations: alluding to his father, in his motto, Maty applies\r\nVirgil's description of the young Ascanius, \"Sequitur _patrem_ non\r\npassibus æquis.\" He says he only holds a _monthly conversation_ with the\r\npublic. His obstinate resolution of carrying on this review without an\r\nassociate, has shown its folly and its danger; for a fatal illness\r\nproduced a cessation, at once, of his periodical labours and his life.\r\n\r\nOther reviews, are the _Mémoires de Trevoux_, written by the Jesuits.\r\nTheir caustic censure and vivacity of style made them redoubtable in\r\ntheir day; they did not even spare their brothers. The _Journal\r\nLittéraire_, printed at the Hague, was chiefly composed by Prosper\r\nMarchand, Sallengre, and Van Effen, who were then young writers. This\r\nlist may be augmented by other journals, which sometimes merit\r\npreservation in the history of modern literature.\r\n\r\nOur early English journals notice only a few publications, with little\r\nacumen. Of these, the \"Memoirs of Literature,\" and the \"Present State of\r\nthe Republic of Letters,\" are the best. The Monthly Review, the\r\nvenerable (now the deceased) mother of our journals, commenced in 1749.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to form a literary journal in a manner such as might be\r\nwished; it must be the work of many, of different tempers and talents.\r\nAn individual, however versatile and extensive his genius, would soon be\r\nexhausted. Such a regular labour occasioned Bayle a dangerous illness,\r\nand Maty fell a victim to his Review. A prospect always extending as we\r\nproceed, the frequent novelty of the matter, the pride of considering\r\none's self as the arbiter of literature, animate a journalist at the\r\ncommencement of his career; but the literary Hercules becomes fatigued;\r\nand to supply his craving pages he gives copious extracts, till the\r\njournal becomes tedious, or fails in variety. The Abbé Gallois was\r\nfrequently diverted from continuing his journal, and Fontenelle remarks,\r\nthat this occupation was too restrictive for a mind so extensive as his;\r\nthe Abbé could not resist the charms of revelling in a new work, and\r\ngratifying any sudden curiosity which seized him; this interrupted\r\nperpetually the regularity which the public expects from a journalist.\r\n\r\nThe character of a perfect journalist would be only an ideal portrait;\r\nthere are, however, some acquirements which are indispensable. He must\r\nbe tolerably acquainted with the subjects he treats on; no _common_\r\nacquirement! He must possess the _literary history of his own times_; a\r\nscience which, Fontenelle observes, is almost distinct from any other.\r\nIt is the result of an active curiosity, which takes a lively interest\r\nin the tastes and pursuits of the age, while it saves the journalist\r\nfrom some ridiculous blunders. We often see the mind of a reviewer half\r\na century remote from the work reviewed. A fine feeling of the various\r\nmanners of writers, with a style adapted to fix the attention of the\r\nindolent, and to win the untractable, should be his study; but candour\r\nis the brightest gem of criticism! He ought not to throw everything into\r\nthe crucible, nor should he suffer the whole to pass as if he trembled\r\nto touch it. Lampoons and satires in time will lose their effect, as\r\nwell as panegyrics. He must learn to resist the seductions of his own\r\npen: the pretension of composing a treatise on the _subject_, rather\r\nthan on the _book_ he criticises--proud of insinuating that he gives, in\r\na dozen pages, what the author himself has not been able to perform in\r\nhis volumes. Should he gain confidence by a popular delusion, and by\r\nunworthy conduct, he may chance to be mortified by the pardon or by the\r\nchastisement of insulted genius. The most noble criticism is that in\r\nwhich the critic is not the antagonist so much as the rival of the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOVERY OF MANUSCRIPTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur ancient classics had a very narrow escape from total annihilation.\r\nMany have perished: many are but fragments; and chance, blind arbiter of\r\nthe works of genius, has left us some, not of the highest value; which,\r\nhowever, have proved very useful, as a test to show the pedantry of\r\nthose who adore antiquity not from true feeling, but from traditional\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\nWe lost a great number of ancient authors by the conquest of Egypt by\r\nthe Saracens, which deprived Europe of the use of the _papyrus_. They\r\ncould find no substitute, and knew no other expedient but writing on\r\nparchment, which became every day more scarce and costly. Ignorance and\r\nbarbarism unfortunately seized on Roman manuscripts, and industriously\r\ndefaced pages once imagined to have been immortal! The most elegant\r\ncompositions of classic Rome were converted into the psalms of a\r\nbreviary, or the prayers of a missal. Livy and Tacitus \"hide their\r\ndiminished heads\" to preserve the legend of a saint, and immortal truths\r\nwere converted into clumsy fictions. It happened that the most\r\nvoluminous authors were the greatest sufferers; these were preferred,\r\nbecause their volume being the greatest, most profitably repaid their\r\ndestroying industry, and furnished ampler scope for future\r\ntranscription. A Livy or a Diodorus was preferred to the smaller works\r\nof Cicero or Horace; and it is to this circumstance that Juvenal,\r\nPersius, and Martial have come down to us entire, rather probably than\r\nto these pious personages preferring their obscenities, as some have\r\naccused them. At Rome, a part of a book of Livy was found, between the\r\nlines of a parchment but half effaced, on which they had substituted a\r\nbook of the Bible; and a recent discovery of Cicero _De Republicâ_,\r\nwhich lay concealed under some monkish writing, shows the fate of\r\nancient manuscripts.[13]\r\n\r\nThat the Monks had not in high veneration the _profane_ authors, appears\r\nby a facetious anecdote. To read the classics was considered as a very\r\nidle recreation, and some held them in great horror. To distinguish them\r\nfrom other books, they invented a disgraceful sign: when a monk asked\r\nfor a pagan author, after making the general sign they used in their\r\nmanual and silent language when they wanted a book, he added a\r\nparticular one, which consisted in scratching under his ear, as a dog,\r\nwhich feels an itching, scratches himself in that place with his\r\npaw--because, said they, an unbeliever is compared to a dog! In this\r\nmanner they expressed an _itching_ for those _dogs_ Virgil or\r\nHorace![14]\r\n\r\nThere have been ages when, for the possession of a manuscript, some\r\nwould transfer an estate, or leave in pawn for its loan hundreds of\r\ngolden crowns; and when even the sale or loan of a manuscript was\r\nconsidered of such importance as to have been solemnly registered by\r\npublic acts. Absolute as was Louis XI. he could not obtain the MS. of\r\nRasis, an Arabian writer, from the library of the Faculty of Paris, to\r\nhave a copy made, without pledging a hundred golden crowns; and the\r\npresident of his treasury, charged with this commission, sold part of\r\nhis plate to make the deposit. For the loan of a volume of Avicenna, a\r\nBaron offered a pledge of ten marks of silver, which was refused:\r\nbecause it was not considered equal to the risk incurred of losing a\r\nvolume of Avicenna! These events occurred in 1471. One cannot but smile,\r\nat an anterior period, when a Countess of Anjou bought a favourite book\r\nof homilies for two hundred sheep, some skins of martins, and bushels of\r\nwheat and rye.\r\n\r\nIn those times, manuscripts were important articles of commerce; they\r\nwere excessively scarce, and preserved with the utmost care. Usurers\r\nthemselves considered them as precious objects for pawn. A student of\r\nPavia, who was reduced, raised a new fortune by leaving in pawn a\r\nmanuscript of a body of law; and a grammarian, who was ruined by a fire,\r\nrebuilt his house with two small volumes of Cicero.\r\n\r\nAt the restoration of letters, the researches of literary men were\r\nchiefly directed to this point; every part of Europe and Greece was\r\nransacked; and, the glorious end considered, there was something sublime\r\nin this humble industry, which often recovered a lost author of\r\nantiquity, and gave one more classic to the world. This occupation was\r\ncarried on with enthusiasm, and a kind of mania possessed many, who\r\nexhausted their fortunes in distant voyages and profuse prices. In\r\nreading the correspondence of the learned Italians of these times, their\r\nadventures of manuscript-hunting are very amusing; and their raptures,\r\ntheir congratulations, or at times their condolence, and even their\r\ncensures, are all immoderate. The acquisition of a province would not\r\nhave given so much satisfaction as the discovery or an author little\r\nknown, or not known at all. \"Oh, great gain! Oh, unexpected felicity! I\r\nintreat you, my Poggio, send me the manuscript as soon as possible, that\r\nI may see it before I die!\" exclaims Aretino, in a letter overflowing\r\nwith enthusiasm, on Poggio's discovery of a copy of Quintilian. Some of\r\nthe half-witted, who joined in this great hunt, were often thrown out,\r\nand some paid high for manuscripts not authentic; the knave played on\r\nthe bungling amateur of manuscripts, whose credulity exceeded his purse.\r\nBut even among the learned, much ill-blood was inflamed; he who had\r\nbeen most successful in acquiring manuscripts was envied by the less\r\nfortunate, and the glory of possessing a manuscript of Cicero seemed to\r\napproximate to that of being its author. It is curious to observe that\r\nin these vast importations into Italy of manuscripts from Asia, John\r\nAurispa, who brought many hundreds of Greek manuscripts, laments that he\r\nhad chosen more profane than sacred writers; which circumstance he tells\r\nus was owing to the Greeks, who would not so easily part with\r\ntheological works, but did not highly value profane writers!\r\n\r\nThese manuscripts were discovered in the obscurest recesses of\r\nmonasteries; they were not always imprisoned in libraries, but rotting\r\nin dark unfrequented corners with rubbish. It required not less\r\ningenuity to find out places where to grope in, than to understand the\r\nvalue of the acquisition. An universal ignorance then prevailed in the\r\nknowledge of ancient writers. A scholar of those times gave the first\r\nrank among the Latin writers to one Valerius, whether he meant Martial\r\nor Maximus is uncertain; he placed Plato and Tully among the poets, and\r\nimagined that Ennius and Statius were contemporaries. A library of six\r\nhundred volumes was then considered as an extraordinary collection.\r\n\r\nAmong those whose lives were devoted to this purpose, Poggio the\r\nFlorentine stands distinguished; but he complains that his zeal was not\r\nassisted by the great. He found under a heap of rubbish in a decayed\r\ncoffer, in a tower belonging to the monastery of St. Gallo, the work of\r\nQuintilian. He is indignant at its forlorn situation; at least, he\r\ncries, it should have been preserved in the library of the monks; but I\r\nfound it _in teterrimo quodam et obscuro carcere_--and to his great joy\r\ndrew it out of its grave! The monks have been complimented as the\r\npreservers of literature, but by facts, like the present, their real\r\naffection may be doubted.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable copy of Tacitus, of whom so much is wanting, was\r\nlikewise discovered in a monastery of Westphalia. It is a curious\r\ncircumstance in literary history, that we should owe Tacitus to this\r\nsingle copy; for the Roman emperor of that name had copies of the works\r\nof his illustrious ancestor placed in all the libraries of the empire,\r\nand every year had ten copies transcribed; but the Roman libraries seem\r\nto have been all destroyed, and the imperial protection availed nothing\r\nagainst the teeth of time.\r\n\r\nThe original manuscript of Justinian's Pandects was discovered by the\r\nPisans, when they took a city in Calabria; that vast code of laws had\r\nbeen in a manner unknown from the time of that emperor. This curious\r\nbook was brought to Pisa; and when Pisa was taken by the Florentines,\r\nwas transferred to Florence, where it is still preserved.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happened that manuscripts were discovered in the last\r\nagonies of existence. Papirius Masson found, in the house of a\r\nbookbinder of Lyons, the works of Agobard; the mechanic was on the point\r\nof using the manuscripts to line the covers of his books.[15] A page of\r\nthe second decade of Livy, it is said, was found by a man of letters in\r\nthe parchment of his battledore, while he was amusing himself in the\r\ncountry. He hastened to the maker of the battledore--but arrived too\r\nlate! The man had finished the last page of Livy--about a week before.\r\n\r\nMany works have undoubtedly perished in this manuscript state. By a\r\npetition of Dr. Dee to Queen Mary, in the Cotton library, it appears\r\nthat Cicero's treatise _De Republicâ_ was once extant in this country.\r\nHuet observes that Petronius was probably entire in the days of John of\r\nSalisbury, who quotes fragments, not now to be found in the remains of\r\nthe Roman bard. Raimond Soranzo, a lawyer in the papal court, possessed\r\ntwo books of Cicero \"on Glory,\" which he presented to Petrarch, who lent\r\nthem to a poor aged man of letters, formerly his preceptor. Urged by\r\nextreme want, the old man pawned them, and returning home died suddenly\r\nwithout having revealed where he had left them. They have never been\r\nrecovered. Petrarch speaks of them with ecstasy, and tells us that he\r\nhad studied them perpetually. Two centuries afterwards, this treatise on\r\nGlory by Cicero was mentioned in a catalogue of books bequeathed to a\r\nmonastery of nuns, but when inquired after was missing. It was supposed\r\nthat Petrus Alcyonius, physician to that household, purloined it, and\r\nafter transcribing as much of it as he could into his own writings, had\r\ndestroyed the original. Alcyonius, in his book _De Exilio_, the critics\r\nobserved, had many splendid passages which stood isolated in his work,\r\nand were quite above his genius. The beggar, or in this case the thief,\r\nwas detected by mending his rags with patches of purple and gold.\r\n\r\nIn this age of manuscript, there is reason to believe, that when a man\r\nof letters accidentally obtained an unknown work, he did not make the\r\nfairest use of it, but cautiously concealed it from his contemporaries.\r\nLeonard Aretino, a distinguished scholar at the dawn of modern\r\nliterature, having found a Greek manuscript of Procopius _De Bello\r\nGothico_, translated it into Latin, and published the work; but\r\nconcealing the author's name, it passed as his own, till another\r\nmanuscript of the same work being dug out of its grave, the fraud of\r\nAretino was apparent. Barbosa, a bishop of Ugento, in 1649, has printed\r\namong his works a treatise, obtained by one of his domestics bringing in\r\na fish rolled in a leaf of written paper, which his curiosity led him to\r\nexamine. He was sufficiently interested to run out and search the fish\r\nmarket, till he found the manuscript out of which it had been torn. He\r\npublished it, under the title _De Officio Episcopi_. Machiavelli acted\r\nmore adroitly in a similar case; a manuscript of the Apophthegms of the\r\nAncients by Plutarch having fallen into his hands, he selected those\r\nwhich pleased him, and put them into the mouth of his hero Castrucio\r\nCastricani.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times, we might collect many curious anecdotes concerning\r\nmanuscripts. Sir Robert Cotton one day at his tailor's discovered that\r\nthe man was holding in his hand, ready to cut up for measures--an\r\noriginal Magna Charta, with all its appendages of seals and signatures.\r\nThis anecdote is told by Colomiés, who long resided in this country; and\r\nan original Magna Charta is preserved in the Cottonian library\r\nexhibiting marks of dilapidation.\r\n\r\nCardinal Granvelle[16] left behind him several chests filled with a\r\nprodigious quantity of letters written in different languages,\r\ncommented, noted, and underlined by his own hand. These curious\r\nmanuscripts, after his death, were left in a garret to the mercy of the\r\nrain and the rats. Five or six of these chests the steward sold to the\r\ngrocers. It was then that a discovery was made of this treasure. Several\r\nlearned men occupied themselves in collecting sufficient of these\r\nliterary relics to form eighty thick folios, consisting of original\r\nletters by all the crowned heads in Europe, with instructions for\r\nambassadors, and other state-papers.\r\n\r\nA valuable secret history by Sir George Mackenzie, the king's advocate\r\nin Scotland, was rescued from a mass of waste paper sold to a grocer,\r\nwho had the good sense to discriminate it, and communicated this curious\r\nmemorial to Dr. M'Crie. The original, in the handwriting of its author,\r\nhas been deposited in the Advocate's Library. There is an hiatus, which\r\ncontained the history of six years. This work excited inquiry after the\r\nrest of the MSS., which were found to be nothing more than the sweepings\r\nof an attorney's office.\r\n\r\nMontaigne's Journal of his Travels into Italy has been but recently\r\npublished. A prebendary of Perigord, travelling through this province to\r\nmake researches relative to its history, arrived at the ancient\r\n_château_ of Montaigne, in possession of a descendant of this great man.\r\nHe inquired for the archives, if there had been any. He was shown an old\r\nworm-eaten coffer, which had long held papers untouched by the incurious\r\ngenerations of Montaigne. Stifled in clouds of dust, he drew out the\r\noriginal manuscript of the travels of Montaigne. Two-thirds of the work\r\nare in the handwriting of Montaigne, and the rest is written by a\r\nservant, who always speaks of his master in the third person. But he\r\nmust have written what Montaigne dictated, as the expressions and the\r\negotisms are all Montaigne's. The bad writing and orthography made it\r\nalmost unintelligible. They confirmed Montaigne's own observation, that\r\nhe was very negligent in the correction of his works.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors were great hiders of manuscripts: Dr. Dee's singular MSS.\r\nwere found in the secret drawer of a chest, which had passed through\r\nmany hands undiscovered; and that vast collection of state-papers of\r\nThurloe's, the secretary of Cromwell, which formed about seventy volumes\r\nin the original manuscripts, accidentally fell out of the false ceiling\r\nof some chambers in Lincoln's-Inn.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's Letters I\r\ndiscovered in the hands of an attorney: family-papers are often\r\nconsigned to offices of lawyers, where many valuable manuscripts are\r\nburied. Posthumous publications of this kind are too frequently made\r\nfrom sordid motives: discernment and taste would only be detrimental to\r\nthe views of bulky publishers.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: This important political treatise was discovered in the\r\nyear 1823, by Angelo Maii, in the library of the Vatican. A treatise on\r\nthe Psalms covered it. This second treatise was written in the clear,\r\nminute character of the middle ages, but beneath it Maii saw distinct\r\ntraces of the larger letters of the work of Cicero; and to the infinite\r\njoy of the learned succeeded in restoring to the world one of the most\r\nimportant works of the great orator.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: \"Many bishops and abbots began to consider learning as\r\npernicious to true piety, and confounded illiberal ignorance with\r\nChristian simplicity,\" says Warton. The study of Pagan authors was\r\ndeclared to inculcate Paganism; the same sort of reasoning led others to\r\nsay that the reading of the Scriptures would infallibly change the\r\nreaders to Jews; it is amusing to look back on these vain efforts to\r\nstop the effect of the printing-press.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Agobard was Archbishop of Lyons, and one of the most\r\nlearned men of the ninth century. He was born in 779; raised to the\r\nprelacy in 816, from which he was expelled by Louis le Debonnaire for\r\nespousing the cause of his son Lothaire; he fled to Italy, but was\r\nrestored to his see in 838, dying in 840, when the Church canonized him.\r\nHe was a strenuous Churchman, but with enlightened views; and his style\r\nas an author is remarkable alike for its clearness and perfect\r\nsimplicity. His works were unknown until discovered in the manner\r\nnarrated above, and were published by the discoverer at Paris in 1603,\r\nthe originals being bequeathed to the Royal Library at his death. On\r\nexamination, several errors were found in this edition, and a new one\r\nwas published in 1662, to which another treatise by Agobard was added.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The celebrated minister of Philip II.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: One of the most curious modern discoveries was that of the\r\nFairfax papers and correspondence by the late J. N. Hughes, of\r\nWinchester, who purchased at a sale at Leeds Castle, Kent, a box\r\napparently filled with old coloured paving-tiles; on removing the upper\r\nlayers he found a large mass of manuscripts of the time of the Civil\r\nwars, evidently thus packed for concealment; they have since been\r\npublished, and add most valuable information to this interesting period\r\nof English history.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF CRITICISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be some satisfaction to show the young writer, that the\r\nmost celebrated ancients have been as rudely subjected to the tyranny of\r\ncriticism as the moderns. Detraction has ever poured the \"waters of\r\nbitterness.\"\r\n\r\nIt was given out, that Homer had stolen from anterior poets whatever was\r\nmost remarkable in the Iliad and Odyssey. Naucrates even points out the\r\nsource in the library at Memphis in a temple of Vulcan, which according\r\nto him the blind bard completely pillaged. Undoubtedly there were good\r\npoets before Homer; how absurd to conceive that an elaborate poem could\r\nbe the first! We have indeed accounts of anterior poets, and apparently\r\nof epics, before Homer; Ælian notices Syagrus, who composed a poem on\r\nthe Siege of Troy; and Suidas the poem of Corinnus, from which it is\r\nsaid Homer greatly borrowed. Why did Plato so severely condemn the great\r\nbard, and imitate him?\r\n\r\nSophocles was brought to trial by his children as a lunatic; and some,\r\nwho censured the inequalities of this poet, have also condemned the\r\nvanity of Pindar; the rough verses of Æschylus; and Euripides, for the\r\nconduct of his plots.\r\n\r\nSocrates, considered as the wisest and the most moral of men, Cicero\r\ntreated as an usurer, and the pedant Athenæus as illiterate; the latter\r\npoints out as a Socratic folly our philosopher disserting on the nature\r\nof justice before his judges, who were so many thieves. The malignant\r\nbuffoonery of Aristophanes treats him much worse; but he, as Jortin\r\nsays, was a great wit, but a great rascal.\r\n\r\nPlato--who has been called, by Clement of Alexandria, the Moses of\r\nAthens; the philosopher of the Christians, by Arnobius; and the god of\r\nphilosophers, by Cicero--Athenæus accuses of envy; Theopompus of lying;\r\nSuidas of avarice; Aulus Gellius, of robbery; Porphyry, of incontinence;\r\nand Aristophanes, of impiety.\r\n\r\nAristotle, whose industry composed more than four hundred volumes, has\r\nnot been less spared by the critics; Diogenes Laertius, Cicero, and\r\nPlutarch, have forgotten nothing that can tend to show his ignorance,\r\nhis ambition, and his vanity.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, that Plato was so envious of the celebrity of\r\nDemocritus, that he proposed burning all his works; but that Amydis and\r\nClinias prevented it, by remonstrating that there were copies of them\r\neverywhere; and Aristotle was agitated by the same passion against all\r\nthe philosophers his predecessors.\r\n\r\nVirgil is destitute of invention, if we are to give credit to Pliny,\r\nCarbilius, and Seneca. Caligula has absolutely denied him even\r\nmediocrity; Herennus has marked his faults; and Perilius Faustinus has\r\nfurnished a thick volume with his plagiarisms. Even the author of his\r\napology has confessed, that he has stolen from Homer his greatest\r\nbeauties; from Apollonius Rhodius, many of his pathetic passages; from\r\nNicander, hints for his Georgies; and this does not terminate the\r\ncatalogue.\r\n\r\nHorace censures the coarse humour of Plautus; and Horace, in his turn,\r\nhas been blamed for the free use he made of the Greek minor poets.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the critics regard Pliny's Natural History only as a\r\nheap of fables; and Pliny cannot bear with Diodorus and Vopiscus; and in\r\none comprehensive criticism, treats all the historians as narrators of\r\nfables.\r\n\r\nLivy has been reproached for his aversion to the Gauls; Dion, for his\r\nhatred of the republic; Velleius Paterculus, for speaking too kindly of\r\nthe vices of Tiberius; and Herodotus and Plutarch, for their excessive\r\npartiality to their own country: while the latter has written an entire\r\ntreatise on the malignity of Herodotus. Xenophon and Quintus Curtius\r\nhave been considered rather as novelists than historians; and Tacitus\r\nhas been censured for his audacity in pretending to discover the\r\npolitical springs and secret causes of events. Dionysius of\r\nHarlicarnassus has made an elaborate attack on Thucydides for the\r\nunskilful choice of his subject, and his manner of treating it.\r\nDionysius would have nothing written but what tended to the glory of his\r\ncountry and the pleasure of the reader--as if history were a song! adds\r\nHobbes, who also shows a personal motive in this attack. The same\r\nDionysius severely criticises the style of Xenophon, who, he says, in\r\nattempting to elevate his style, shows himself incapable of supporting\r\nit. Polybius has been blamed for his frequent introduction of\r\nreflections which interrupt the thread of his narrative; and Sallust has\r\nbeen blamed by Cato for indulging his own private passions, and\r\nstudiously concealing many of the glorious actions of Cicero. The Jewish\r\nhistorian, Josephus, is accused of not having designed his history for\r\nhis own people so much as for the Greeks and Romans, whom he takes the\r\nutmost care never to offend. Josephus assumes a Roman name, Flavius; and\r\nconsidering his nation as entirely subjugated, to make them appear\r\ndignified to their conquerors, alters what he himself calls the _Holy\r\nbooks_. It is well known how widely he differs from the scriptural\r\naccounts. Some have said of Cicero, that there is no connexion, and to\r\nadopt their own figures, no _blood_ and _nerves_, in what his admirers\r\nso warmly extol. Cold in his extemporaneous effusions, artificial in his\r\nexordiums, trifling in his strained raillery, and tiresome in his\r\ndigressions. This is saying a good deal about Cicero.\r\n\r\nQuintilian does not spare Seneca; and Demosthenes, called by Cicero the\r\nprince of orators, has, according to Hermippus, more of art than of\r\nnature. To Demades, his orations appear too much laboured; others have\r\nthought him too dry; and, if we may trust Æschines, his language is by\r\nno means pure.\r\n\r\nThe Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius, and the Deipnosophists of Athenæus,\r\nwhile they have been extolled by one party, have been degraded by\r\nanother. They have been considered as botchers of rags and remnants;\r\ntheir diligence has not been accompanied by judgment; and their taste\r\ninclined more to the frivolous than to the useful. Compilers, indeed,\r\nare liable to a hard fate, for little distinction is made in their\r\nranks; a disagreeable situation, in which honest Burton seems to have\r\nbeen placed; for he says of his work, that some will cry out, \"This is a\r\nthinge of meere industrie; a _collection_ without wit or invention; a\r\nvery toy! So men are valued; their labours vilified by fellowes of no\r\nworth themselves, as things of nought: Who could not have done as much?\r\nSome understande too little, and some too much.\"\r\n\r\nShould we proceed with this list to our own country, and to our own\r\ntimes, it might be curiously augmented, and show the world what men the\r\nCritics are! but, perhaps, enough has been said to soothe irritated\r\ngenius, and to shame fastidious criticism. \"I would beg the critics to\r\nremember,\" the Earl of Roscommon writes, in his preface to Horace's Art\r\nof Poetry, \"that Horace owed his favour and his fortune to the character\r\ngiven of him by Virgil and Varus; that Fundanius and Pollio are still\r\nvalued by what Horace says of them; and that, in their golden age, there\r\nwas a good understanding among the ingenious; and those who were the\r\nmost esteemed, were the best natured.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERSECUTED LEARNED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have laboured most zealously to instruct mankind have been\r\nthose who have suffered most from ignorance; and the discoverers of new\r\narts and sciences have hardly ever lived to see them accepted by the\r\nworld. With a noble perception of his own genius, Lord Bacon, in his\r\nprophetic Will, thus expresses himself: \"For my name and memory, I leave\r\nit to men's charitable speeches, and to foreign nations, and the next\r\nages.\" Before the times of Galileo and Harvey the world believed in the\r\nstagnation of the blood, and the diurnal immovability of the earth; and\r\nfor denying these the one was persecuted and the other ridiculed.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence and the virtue of Socrates were punished with death.\r\nAnaxagoras, when he attempted to propagate a just notion of the Supreme\r\nBeing, was dragged to prison. Aristotle, after a long series of\r\npersecution, swallowed poison. Heraclitus, tormented by his countrymen,\r\nbroke off all intercourse with men. The great geometricians and\r\nchemists, as Gerbert, Roger Bacon, and Cornelius Agrippa, were abhorred\r\nas magicians. Pope Gerbert, as Bishop Otho gravely relates, obtained the\r\npontificate by having given himself up entirely to the devil: others\r\nsuspected him, too, of holding an intercourse with demons; but this was\r\nindeed a devilish age!\r\n\r\nVirgilius, Bishop of Saltzburg, having asserted that there existed\r\nantipodes, the Archbishop of Mentz declared him a heretic; and the Abbot\r\nTrithemius, who was fond of improving steganography or the art of secret\r\nwriting, having published several curious works on this subject, they\r\nwere condemned, as works full of diabolical mysteries; and Frederic\r\nII., Elector Palatine, ordered Trithemius's original work, which was in\r\nhis library, to be publicly burnt.\r\n\r\nGalileo was condemned at Rome publicly to disavow sentiments, the truth\r\nof which must have been to him abundantly manifest. \"Are these then my\r\njudges?\" he exclaimed, in retiring from the inquisitors, whose ignorance\r\nastonished him. He was imprisoned, and visited by Milton, who tells us,\r\nhe was then _poor_ and _old_. The confessor of his widow, taking\r\nadvantage of her piety, perused the MSS. of this great philosopher, and\r\ndestroyed such as in his _judgment_ were not fit to be known to the\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nGabriel Naudé, in his apology for those great men who have been accused\r\nof magic, has recorded a melancholy number of the most eminent scholars,\r\nwho have found, that to have been successful in their studies, was a\r\nsuccess which harassed them with continual persecution--a prison or a\r\ngrave!\r\n\r\nCornelius Agrippa was compelled to fly his country, and the enjoyment of\r\na large income, merely for having displayed a few philosophical\r\nexperiments, which now every school-boy can perform; but more\r\nparticularly having attacked the then prevailing opinion, that St. Anne\r\nhad three husbands, he was obliged to fly from place to place. The\r\npeople beheld him as an object of horror; and when he walked, he found\r\nthe streets empty at his approach.\r\n\r\nIn those times, it was a common opinion to suspect every great man of an\r\nintercourse with some familiar spirit. The favourite black dog of\r\nAgrippa was supposed to be a demon. When Urban Grandier, another victim\r\nto the age, was led to the stake, a large fly settled on his head: a\r\nmonk, who had heard that Beelzebub signifies in Hebrew the God of Flies,\r\nreported that he saw this spirit come to take possession of him. M. de\r\nLangier, a French minister, who employed many spies, was frequently\r\naccused of diabolical communication. Sixtus the Fifth, Marechal Faber,\r\nRoger Bacon, Cæsar Borgia, his son Alexander VI., and others, like\r\nSocrates, had their diabolical attendant.\r\n\r\nCardan was believed to be a magician. An able naturalist, who happened\r\nto know something of the arcana of nature, was immediately suspected of\r\nmagic. Even the learned themselves, who had not applied to natural\r\nphilosophy, seem to have acted with the same feelings as the most\r\nignorant; for when Albert, usually called the Great, an epithet it has\r\nbeen said that he derived from his name _De Groot_, constructed a\r\ncurious piece of mechanism, which sent forth distinct vocal sounds,\r\nThomas Aquinas was so much terrified at it, that he struck it with his\r\nstaff, and, to the mortification of Albert, annihilated the curious\r\nlabour of thirty years!\r\n\r\nPetrarch was less desirous of the laurel for the honour, than for the\r\nhope of being sheltered by it from the thunder of the priests, by whom\r\nboth he and his brother poets were continually threatened. They could\r\nnot imagine a poet, without supposing him to hold an intercourse with\r\nsome demon. This was, as Abbé Resnel observes, having a most exalted\r\nidea of poetry, though a very bad one of poets. An anti-poetic Dominican\r\nwas notorious for persecuting all verse-makers; whose power he\r\nattributed to the effects of _heresy_ and _magic_. The lights of\r\nphilosophy have dispersed all these accusations of magic, and have shown\r\na dreadful chain of perjuries and conspiracies.\r\n\r\nDescartes was horribly persecuted in Holland, when he first published\r\nhis opinions. Voetius, a bigot of great influence at Utrecht, accused\r\nhim of atheism, and had even projected in his mind to have this\r\nphilosopher burnt at Utrecht in an extraordinary fire, which, kindled on\r\nan eminence, might be observed by the seven provinces. Mr. Hallam has\r\nobserved, that \"the ordeal of fire was the great purifier of books and\r\nmen.\" This persecution of science and genius lasted till the close of\r\nthe seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\"If the metaphysician stood a chance of being burnt as a heretic, the\r\nnatural philosopher was not in less jeopardy as a magician,\" is an\r\nobservation of the same writer, which sums up the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOVERTY OF THE LEARNED.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortune has rarely condescended to be the companion of genius: others\r\nfind a hundred by-roads to her palace; there is but one open, and that a\r\nvery indifferent one, for men of letters. Were we to erect an asylum for\r\nvenerable genius, as we do for the brave and the helpless part of our\r\ncitizens, it might be inscribed, \"An Hospital for Incurables!\" When even\r\nFame will not protect the man of genius from Famine, Charity ought. Nor\r\nshould such an act be considered as a debt incurred by the helpless\r\nmember, but a just tribute we pay in his person to Genius itself. Even\r\nin these enlightened times, many have lived in obscurity, while their\r\nreputation was widely spread, and have perished in poverty, while their\r\nworks were enriching the booksellers.\r\n\r\nOf the heroes of modern literature the accounts are as copious as they\r\nare sorrowful.\r\n\r\nXylander sold his notes on Dion Cassius for a dinner. He tells us that\r\nat the age of eighteen he studied to acquire glory, but at twenty-five\r\nhe studied to get bread.\r\n\r\nCervantes, the immortal genius of Spain, is supposed to have wanted\r\nfood; Camöens, the solitary pride of Portugal, deprived of the\r\nnecessaries of life, perished in an hospital at Lisbon. This fact has\r\nbeen accidentally preserved in an entry in a copy of the first edition\r\nof the Lusiad, in the possession of Lord Holland. It is a note, written\r\nby a friar who must have been a witness of the dying scene of the poet,\r\nand probably received the volume which now preserves the sad memorial,\r\nand which recalled it to his mind, from the hands of the unhappy\r\npoet:--\"What a lamentable thing to see so great a genius so ill\r\nrewarded! I saw him die in an hospital in Lisbon, without having a sheet\r\nor shroud, _una sauana_, to cover him, after having triumphed in the\r\nEast Indies, and sailed 5500 leagues! What good advice for those who\r\nweary themselves night and day in study without profit!\" Camöens, when\r\nsome fidalgo complained that he had not performed his promise in writing\r\nsome verses for him, replied, \"When I wrote verses I was young, had\r\nsufficient food, was a lover, and beloved by many friends and by the\r\nladies; then I felt poetical ardour: now I have no spirits, no peace of\r\nmind. See there my Javanese, who asks me for two pieces to purchase\r\nfiring, and I have them not to give him.\" The Portuguese, after his\r\ndeath, bestowed on the man of genius they had starved, the appellation\r\nof Great![18] Vondel, the Dutch Shakspeare, after composing a number of\r\npopular tragedies, lived in great poverty, and died at ninety years of\r\nage; then he had his coffin carried by fourteen poets, who without his\r\ngenius probably partook of his wretchedness.\r\n\r\nThe great Tasso was reduced to such a dilemma that he was obliged to\r\nborrow a crown for a week's subsistence. He alludes to his distress\r\nwhen, entreating his cat to assist him, during the night, with the\r\nlustre of her eyes--\"_Non avendo candele per iscrivere i suoi versi_!\"\r\nhaving no candle to see to write his verses.\r\n\r\nWhen the liberality of Alphonso enabled Ariosto to build a small house,\r\nit seems that it was but ill furnished. When told that such a building\r\nwas not fit for one who had raised so many fine palaces in his writings,\r\nhe answered, that the structure of _words_ and that of _stones_ was not\r\nthe same thing. _\"Che pervi le pietre, e porvi le parole, non è il\r\nmedesimo!\"_ At Ferrari this house is still shown, \"Parva sed apta\" he\r\ncalls it, but exults that it was paid for with his own money. This was\r\nin a moment of good humour, which he did not always enjoy; for in his\r\nSatires he bitterly complains of the bondage of dependence and poverty.\r\nLittle thought the poet that the _commune_ would order this small house\r\nto be purchased with their own funds, that it might be dedicated to his\r\nimmortal memory.\r\n\r\nCardinal Bentivoglio, the ornament of Italy and of literature,\r\nlanguished, in his old age, in the most distressful poverty; and having\r\nsold his palace to satisfy his creditors, left nothing behind him but\r\nhis reputation. The learned Pomponius Lætus lived in such a state of\r\npoverty, that his friend Platina, who wrote the lives of the popes, and\r\nalso a book of cookery, introduces him into the cookery book by a\r\nfacetious observation, that \"If Pomponius Lætus should be robbed of a\r\ncouple of eggs, he would not have wherewithal to purchase two other\r\neggs.\" The history of Aldrovandus is noble and pathetic; having expended\r\na large fortune in forming his collections of natural history, and\r\nemploying the first artists in Europe, he was suffered to die in the\r\nhospital of that city, to whose fame he had eminently contributed.\r\n\r\nDu Ryer, a celebrated French poet, was constrained to write with\r\nrapidity, and to live in the cottage of an obscure village. His\r\nbookseller bought his heroic verses for one hundred sols the hundred\r\nlines, and the smaller ones for fifty sols. What an interesting picture\r\nhas a contemporary given of a visit to this poor and ingenious author!\r\n\"On a fine summer day we went to him, at some distance from town. He\r\nreceived us with joy, talked to us of his numerous projects, and showed\r\nus several of his works. But what more interested us was, that, though\r\ndreading to expose to us his poverty, he contrived to offer some\r\nrefreshments. We seated ourselves under a wide oak, the table-cloth was\r\nspread on the grass, his wife brought us some milk, with fresh water and\r\nbrown bread, and he picked a basket of cherries. He welcomed us with\r\ngaiety, but we could not take leave of this amiable man, now grown old,\r\nwithout tears, to see him so ill treated by fortune, and to have nothing\r\nleft but literary honour!\"\r\n\r\nVaugelas, the most polished writer of the French language, who devoted\r\nthirty years to his translation of Quintus Curtius, (a circumstance\r\nwhich modern translators can have no conception of), died possessed of\r\nnothing valuable but his precious manuscripts. This ingenious scholar\r\nleft his corpse to the surgeons, for the benefit of his creditors!\r\n\r\nLouis the Fourteenth honoured Racine and Boileau with a private monthly\r\naudience. One day the king asked what there was new in the literary\r\nworld. Racine answered, that he had seen a melancholy spectacle in the\r\nhouse of Corneille, whom he found dying, deprived even of a little\r\nbroth! The king preserved a profound silence; and sent the dying poet a\r\nsum of money.\r\n\r\nDryden, for less than three hundred pounds, sold Tonson ten thousand\r\nverses, as may be seen by the agreement.\r\n\r\nPurchas, who in the reign of our first James, had spent his life in\r\ncompiling his _Relation of the World_, when he gave it to the public,\r\nfor the reward of his labours was thrown into prison, at the suit of his\r\nprinter. Yet this was the book which, he informs Charles I. in his\r\ndedication, his father read every night with great profit and\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Worcester, in a petition to parliament, in the reign of\r\nCharles II., offered to publish the hundred processes and machines,\r\nenumerated in his very curious \"Centenary of Inventions,\" on condition\r\nthat money should be granted to extricate him from the _difficulties in\r\nwhich he had involved himself by the prosecution of useful discoveries_.\r\nThe petition does not appear to have been attended to! Many of these\r\nadmirable inventions were lost. The _steam-engine_ and the _telegraph_,\r\nmay be traced among them.\r\n\r\nIt appears by the Harleian MS. 7524, that Rushworth, the author of the\r\n\"Historical Collections,\" passed the last years of his life in gaol,\r\nwhere indeed he died. After the Restoration, when he presented to the\r\nking several of the privy council's books, which he had preserved from\r\nruin, he received for his only reward the _thanks of his majesty_.\r\n\r\nRymer, the collector of the Foedera, must have been sadly reduced, by\r\nthe following letter, I found addressed by Peter le Neve, Norroy, to the\r\nEarl of Oxford.\r\n\r\n\"I am desired by Mr. Rymer, historiographer, to lay before your lordship\r\nthe circumstances of his affairs. He was forced some years back to part\r\nwith all his choice printed books to subsist himself: and now, he says,\r\nhe must be forced, for subsistence, to sell all his MS. collections to\r\nthe best bidder, without your lordship will be pleased to buy them for\r\nthe queen's library. They are fifty volumes in folio, of public affairs,\r\nwhich he hath collected, but not printed. The price he asks is five\r\nhundred pounds.\"\r\n\r\nSimon Ockley, a learned student in Oriental literature, addresses a\r\nletter to the same earl, in which he paints his distresses in glowing\r\ncolours. After having devoted his life to Asiatic researches, then very\r\nuncommon, he had the mortification of dating his preface to his great\r\nwork from Cambridge Castle, where he was confined for debt; and, with an\r\nair of triumph, feels a martyr's enthusiasm in the cause for which he\r\nperishes.\r\n\r\nHe published his first volume of the History of the Saracens in 1708;\r\nand, ardently pursuing his oriental studies, published his second, ten\r\nyears afterwards, without any patronage. Alluding to the encouragement\r\nnecessary to bestow on youth, to remove the obstacles to such studies,\r\nhe observes, that \"young men will hardly come in on the prospect of\r\nfinding leisure, in a prison, to transcribe those papers for the press,\r\nwhich they have collected with indefatigable labour, and oftentimes at\r\nthe expense of their rest, and all the other conveniences of life, for\r\nthe service of the public. No! though I were to assure them, from my own\r\nexperience, that _I have enjoyed more true liberty, more happy leisure,\r\nand more solid repose, in six months_ HERE, than in thrice the same\r\nnumber of years before. _Evil is the condition of that historian who\r\nundertakes to write the lives of others, before he knows how to live\r\nhimself._--Not that I speak thus as if I thought I had any just cause to\r\nbe angry with the world--I did always in my judgment give the\r\npossession of _wisdom_ the preference to that of _riches_!\"\r\n\r\nSpenser, the child of Fancy, languished out his life in misery, \"Lord\r\nBurleigh,\" says Granger, \"who it is said prevented the queen giving him\r\na hundred pounds, seems to have thought the lowest clerk in his office a\r\nmore deserving person.\" Mr. Malone attempts to show that Spenser had a\r\nsmall pension, but the poet's querulous verses must not be forgotten--\r\n\r\n    \"Full little knowest thou, that hast not try'd,\r\n    What Hell it is, in suing long to bide.\"\r\n\r\nTo lose good days--to waste long nights--and, as he feelingly exclaims,\r\n\r\n    \"To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run,\r\n    To speed, to give, to want, to be undone!\"\r\n\r\nHow affecting is the death of Sydenham, who had devoted his life to a\r\nlaborious version of Plato! He died in a sponging-house, and it was his\r\ndeath which appears to have given rise to the Literary Fund \"for the\r\nrelief of distressed authors.\"[19]\r\n\r\nWho will pursue important labours when they read these anecdotes? Dr.\r\nEdmund Castell spent a great part of his life in compiling his _Lexicon\r\nHeptaglotton_, on which he bestowed incredible pains, and expended on it\r\nno less than 12,000_l._, broke his constitution, and exhausted his\r\nfortune. At length it was printed, but the copies remained _unsold_ on\r\nhis hands. He exhibits a curious picture of literary labour in his\r\npreface. \"As for myself, I have been unceasingly occupied for such a\r\nnumber of years in this mass,\" _Molendino_ he calls them, \"that that\r\nday seemed, as it were, a holiday in which I have not laboured so much\r\nas sixteen or eighteen hours in these enlarging lexicons and Polyglot\r\nBibles.\"\r\n\r\nLe Sage resided in a little cottage while he supplied the world with\r\ntheir most agreeable novels, and appears to have derived the sources of\r\nhis existence in his old age from the filial exertions of an excellent\r\nson, who was an actor of some genius. I wish, however, that every man of\r\nletters could apply to himself the epitaph of this delightful writer:--\r\n\r\n_\"Sous ce tombeau git LE SAGE, abattu Par le ciseau de la Parque\r\nimportune; S'il ne fut pas ami de la fortune, Il fut toujours ami de la\r\nvertu.\"_\r\n\r\nMany years after this article had been written, I published \"Calamities\r\nof Authors,\" confining myself to those of our own country; the catalogue\r\nis incomplete, but far too numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: For some time previous to his death he was in so abject a\r\nstate of poverty as to be dependent for subsistence upon the exertions\r\nof his faithful servant Antonio, a native of Java, whom he had brought\r\nwith him from India, and who was accustomed to beg by night for the\r\nbread which was to save his unhappy master from perishing by want the\r\nnext day. Camöens, when death at last put an end to a life which\r\nmisfortune and neglect had rendered insupportable, was denied the solace\r\nof having his faithful Antonio to close his eyes. He was aged only\r\nfifty-five when he breathed his last in the hospital. This event\r\noccurred in 1579, but so little regard was paid to the memory of this\r\ngreat man that the day or month on which he expired remains\r\nunknown.--Adamson's _Memoirs of Camöens_, 1820.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: This melancholy event happened in 1788, fifteen years\r\nafter the original projector of the Literary Fund, Mr. David Williams,\r\nhad endeavoured to establish it. It appears that Mr. Floyer Sydenham was\r\narrested \"for a small debt; he never spoke after being arrested, and\r\nsunk under the pressure of his calamity.\" This is the published record\r\nof the event by the officers of the present fund; and these simple words\r\nare sufficiently indicative of the harrowing nature of the catastrophe;\r\nit was strongly felt that Mr. Williams' hopeful plan of preventing a\r\nsecond act so fatal should be encouraged. A small literary club took the\r\ninitiative, and subscribed a few guineas to pay for such advertisements\r\nas were necessary to keep the intended objects of the founder before the\r\npublic, and solicit its aid. Two years afterwards a committee was\r\nformed; another two years saw it take position among the established\r\ninstitutions of the country. In 1818 it obtained a royal charter. In its\r\ncareer it has relieved upwards of 1300 applicants, and devoted to that\r\npurpose 47,725_l._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPRISONMENT OF THE LEARNED.\r\n\r\n\r\nImprisonment has not always disturbed the man of letters in the progress\r\nof his studies, but has unquestionably greatly promoted them.\r\n\r\nIn prison Boethius composed his work on the Consolations of Philosophy;\r\nand Grotius wrote his Commentary on Saint Matthew, with other works: the\r\ndetail of his allotment of time to different studies, during his\r\nconfinement, is very instructive.\r\n\r\nBuchanan, in the dungeon of a monastery in Portugal, composed his\r\nexcellent Paraphrases of the Psalms of David.\r\n\r\nCervantes composed the most agreeable book in the Spanish language\r\nduring his captivity in Barbary.\r\n\r\nFleta, a well-known law production, was written by a person confined in\r\nthe Fleet for debt; the name of the _place_, though not that of the\r\n_author_, has thus been preserved; and another work, \"Fleta Minor, or\r\nthe Laws of Art and Nature in, knowing the bodies of Metals, &c. by Sir\r\nJohn Pettus, 1683;\" received its title from the circumstance of his\r\nhaving translated it from the German during his confinement in this\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nLouis the Twelfth, when Duke of Orleans, was long imprisoned in the\r\nTower of Bourges: applying himself to his studies, which he had\r\nhitherto neglected, he became, in consequence, an enlightened monarch.\r\n\r\nMargaret, queen of Henry the Fourth, King of France, confined in the\r\nLouvre, pursued very warmly the studies of elegant literature, and\r\ncomposed a very skilful apology for the irregularities of her conduct.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh's unfinished History of the World, which leaves us to\r\nregret that later ages had not been celebrated by his eloquence, was the\r\nfruits of eleven years of imprisonment. It was written for the use of\r\nPrince Henry, as he and Dallington, who also wrote \"Aphorisms\" for the\r\nsame prince, have told us; the prince looked over the manuscript. Of\r\nRaleigh it is observed, to employ the language of Hume, \"They were\r\nstruck with the extensive genius of the man, who, being educated amidst\r\nnaval and military enterprises, had surpassed, in the pursuits of\r\nliterature, even those of the most recluse and sedentary lives; and they\r\nadmired his unbroken magnanimity, which, at his age, and under his\r\ncircumstances, could engage him to undertake and execute so great a\r\nwork, as his History of the World.\" He was assisted in this great work\r\nby the learning of several eminent persons, a circumstance which has not\r\nbeen usually noticed.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the \"_Henriade_\" was sketched, and the greater part\r\ncomposed, by Voltaire during his imprisonment in the Bastile; and \"the\r\nPilgrim's Progress\" of Bunyan was performed in the circuit of a prison's\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nHowell, the author of \"Familiar Letters,\" wrote the chief part of them,\r\nand almost all his other works, during his long confinement in the Fleet\r\nprison: he employed his fertile pen for subsistence; and in all his\r\nbooks we find much entertainment.\r\n\r\nLydiat, while confined in the King's Bench for debt, wrote his\r\nAnnotations on the Parian Chronicle, which were first published by\r\nPrideaux. He was the learned scholar alluded to by Johnson; an allusion\r\nnot known to Boswell and others.\r\n\r\nThe learned Selden, committed to prison for his attacks on the divine\r\nright of tithes and the king's prerogative, prepared during his\r\nconfinement his \"History of Eadmer,\" enriched by his notes.\r\n\r\nCardinal Polignac formed the design of refuting the arguments of the\r\nsceptics which Bayle had been renewing in his dictionary; but his public\r\noccupations hindered him. Two exiles at length fortunately gave him the\r\nleisure; and the Anti-Lucretius is the fruit of the court disgraces of\r\nits author.\r\n\r\nFreret, when imprisoned in the Bastile, was permitted only to have Bayle\r\nfor his companion. His dictionary was always before him, and his\r\nprinciples were got by heart. To this circumstance we owe his works,\r\nanimated by all the powers of scepticism.\r\n\r\nSir William Davenant finished his poem of Gondibert during his\r\nconfinement by the rebels in Carisbrook Castle. George Withers dedicates\r\nhis \"Shepherds Hunting,\" \"To his friends, my visitants in the\r\nMarshalsea:\" these \"eclogues\" having been printed in his\r\nimprisonment.[20]\r\n\r\nDe Foe, confined in Newgate for a political pamphlet, began his\r\n\"Review;\" a periodical paper, which was extended to nine thick volumes\r\nin quarto, and it has been supposed served as the model of the\r\ncelebrated papers of Steele.\r\n\r\nWicquefort's curious work \"on Ambassadors\" is dated from his prison,\r\nwhere he had been confined for state affairs. He softened the rigour of\r\nthose heavy hours by several historical works.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting facts of this kind is the fate of an Italian\r\nscholar, of the name of Maggi. Early addicted to the study of the\r\nsciences, and particularly to the mathematics, and military\r\narchitecture, he successfully defended Famagusta, besieged by the\r\nTurks, by inventing machines which destroyed their works. When that city\r\nwas taken in 1571, they pillaged his library and carried him away in\r\nchains. Now a slave, after his daily labours he amused a great part of\r\nhis nights by literary compositions; _De Tintinnabulis_, on Bells, a\r\ntreatise still read by the curious, was actually composed by him when a\r\nslave in Turkey, without any other resource than the erudition of his\r\nown memory, and the genius of which adversity could not deprive him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Withers, throughout these unique eclogues, which are\r\nsupposed to narrate the discourses of \"friendly shepherds\" who visit\r\nhim--\r\n\r\n                                  \"--pent\r\n    Within the jaws of strict imprisonment;\r\n    A forlorn shepherd void of all the means,\r\n    Whereon man's common hope in danger leads\"\r\n\r\n--is still upheld by the same consciousness of rectitude which inspired\r\nSir Richard Lovelace in his better-known address \"To Althea from\r\nPrison.\" Withers' poem was published before Lovelace was born. A few\r\nlines from Withers will display this similarity. Speaking of his\r\nenemies, he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"They may do much, but when they have done all,\r\n    Only my body they may bring in thrall.\r\n    And 'tis not that, my Willy; 'tis my mind,\r\n    My mind's more precious freedom I so weigh,\r\n    A thousand ways they may my body bind,\r\n    In thousand thralls, but ne'er my mind betray:\r\n    And hence it is that I contentment find,\r\n    And bear with patience this my load away:\r\n    I'm still myself, and that I'd rather be.\r\n    Than to be lord of all these downs in fee.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMUSEMENTS OF THE LEARNED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Jesuits it was a standing rule of the order, that after an\r\napplication to study for two hours, the mind of the student should be\r\nunbent by some relaxation, however trifling. When Petavius was employed\r\nin his _Dogmata Theologica_, a work of the most profound and extensive\r\nerudition, the great recreation of the learned father was, at the end of\r\nevery second hour, to twirl his chair for five minutes. After protracted\r\nstudies Spinosa would mix with the family-party where he lodged, and\r\njoin in the most trivial conversations, or unbend his mind by setting\r\nspiders to fight each other; he observed their combats with so much\r\ninterest, that he was often seized with immoderate fits of laughter. A\r\ncontinuity of labour deadens the soul, observes Seneca, in closing his\r\ntreatise on \"The Tranquillity of the Soul,\" and the mind must unbend\r\nitself by certain amusements. Socrates did not blush to play with\r\nchildren; Cato, over his bottle, found an alleviation from the fatigues\r\nof government; a circumstance, Seneca says in his manner, which rather\r\ngives honour to this defect, than the defect dishonours Cato. Some men\r\nof letters portioned out their day between repose and labour. Asinius\r\nPollio would not suffer any business to occupy him beyond a stated hour;\r\nafter that time he would not allow any letter to be opened, that his\r\nhours of recreation might not be interrupted by unforeseen labours. In\r\nthe senate, after the tenth hour, it was not allowed to make any new\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nTycho Brahe diverted himself with polishing glasses for all kinds of\r\nspectacles, and making mathematical instruments; an employment too\r\nclosely connected with his studies to be deemed an amusement.\r\n\r\nD'Andilly, the translator of Josephus, after seven or eight hours of\r\nstudy every day, amused himself in cultivating trees; Barclay, the\r\nauthor of the Argenis, in his leisure hours was a florist; Balzac amused\r\nhimself with a collection of crayon portraits; Peirese found his\r\namusement amongst his medals and antiquarian curiosities; the Abbé de\r\nMarolles with his prints; and Politian in singing airs to his lute.\r\nDescartes passed his afternoons in the conversation of a few friends,\r\nand in cultivating a little garden; in the morning, occupied by the\r\nsystem of the world, he relaxed his profound speculations by rearing\r\ndelicate flowers.\r\n\r\nConrad ab Uffenbach, a learned German, recreated his mind, after severe\r\nstudies, with a collection of prints of eminent persons, methodically\r\narranged; he retained this ardour of the _Grangerite_ to his last days.\r\n\r\nRohault wandered from shop to shop to observe the mechanics labour;\r\nCount Caylus passed his mornings in the _studios_ of artists, and his\r\nevenings in writing his numerous works on art. This was the true life of\r\nan amateur.\r\n\r\nGranville Sharp, amidst the severity of his studies, found a social\r\nrelaxation in the amusement of a barge on the Thames, which was well\r\nknown to the circle of his friends; there, was festive hospitality with\r\nmusical delight. It was resorted to by men of the most eminent talents\r\nand rank. His little voyages to Putney, to Kew, and to Richmond, and the\r\nliterary intercourse they produced, were singularly happy ones. \"The\r\nhistory of his amusements cannot be told without adding to the dignity\r\nof his character,\" observes Prince Hoare, in the life of this great\r\nphilanthropist.\r\n\r\nSome have found amusement in composing treatises on odd subjects. Seneca\r\nwrote a burlesque narrative of Claudian's death. Pierius Valerianus has\r\nwritten an eulogium on beards; and we have had a learned one recently,\r\nwith due gravity and pleasantry, entitled \"Eloge de Perruques.\"\r\n\r\nHolstein has written an eulogium on the North Wind; Heinsius, on \"the\r\nAss;\" Menage, \"the Transmigration of the Parasitical Pedant to a\r\nParrot;\" and also the \"Petition of the Dictionaries.\"\r\n\r\nErasmus composed, to amuse himself when travelling, his panegyric on\r\n_Moria_, or folly; which, authorised by the pun, he dedicated to Sir\r\nThomas More.\r\n\r\nSallengre, who would amuse himself like Erasmus, wrote, in imitation of\r\nhis work, a panegyric on _Ebriety_. He says, that he is willing to be\r\nthought as drunken a man as Erasmus was a foolish one. Synesius composed\r\na Greek panegyric on _Baldness_. These burlesques were brought into\r\ngreat vogue by Erasmus's _Moriæ Encomium_.\r\n\r\nIt seems, Johnson observes in his life of Sir Thomas Browne, to have\r\nbeen in all ages the pride of art to show how it could exalt the low and\r\namplify the little. To this ambition, perhaps, we owe the Frogs of\r\nHomer; the Gnat and the Bees of Virgil; the Butterfly of Spenser; the\r\nShadow of Wowerus; and the Quincunx of Browne.\r\n\r\nCardinal de Richelieu, amongst all his great occupations, found a\r\nrecreation in violent exercises; and he was once discovered jumping with\r\nhis servant, to try who could reach the highest side of a wall. De\r\nGrammont, observing the cardinal to be jealous of his powers, offered to\r\njump with him; and, in the true spirit of a courtier, having made some\r\nefforts which nearly reached the cardinal's, confessed the cardinal\r\nsurpassed him. This was jumping like a politician; and by this means he\r\nis said to have ingratiated himself with the minister.\r\n\r\nThe great Samuel Clarke was fond of robust exercise; and this profound\r\nlogician has been found leaping over tables and chairs. Once perceiving\r\na pedantic fellow, he said, \"Now we must desist, for a fool is coming\r\nin!\"[21]\r\n\r\nAn eminent French lawyer, confined by his business to a Parisian life,\r\namused himself with collecting from the classics all the passages which\r\nrelate to a country life. The collection was published after his death.\r\n\r\nContemplative men seem to be fond of amusements which accord with their\r\nhabits. The thoughtful game of chess, and the tranquil delight of\r\nangling, have been favourite recreations with the studious. Paley had\r\nhimself painted with a rod and line in his hand; a strange\r\ncharacteristic for the author of \"Natural Theology.\" Sir Henry Wotton\r\ncalled angling \"idle time not idly spent:\" we may suppose that his\r\nmeditations and his amusements were carried on at the same moment.\r\n\r\nThe amusements of the great d'Aguesseau, chancellor of France, consisted\r\nin an interchange of studies; his relaxations were all the varieties of\r\nliterature. \"Le changement de l'étude est mon seul délassement,\" said\r\nthis great man; and \"in the age of the passions, his only passion was\r\nstudy.\"\r\n\r\nSeneca has observed on amusements proper for literary men, that, in\r\nregard to robust exercises, it is not decent to see a man of letters\r\nexult in the strength of his arm, or the breadth of his back! Such\r\namusements diminish the activity of the mind. Too much fatigue exhausts\r\nthe animal spirits, as too much food blunts the finer faculties: but\r\nelsewhere he allows his philosopher an occasional slight inebriation; an\r\namusement which was very prevalent among our poets formerly, when they\r\nexclaimed:--\r\n\r\n    \"Fetch me Ben Jonson's scull, and fill't with sack,\r\n    Rich as the same he drank, when the whole pack\r\n    Of jolly sisters pledged, and did agree\r\n    It was no sin to be as drunk as he!\"\r\n\r\nSeneca concludes admirably, \"whatever be the amusements you choose,\r\nreturn not slowly from those of the body to the mind; exercise the\r\nlatter night and day. The mind is nourished at a cheap rate; neither\r\ncold nor heat, nor age itself, can interrupt this exercise; give\r\ntherefore all your cares to a possession which ameliorates even in its\r\nold age!\"\r\n\r\nAn ingenious writer has observed, that \"a garden just accommodates\r\nitself to the perambulations of a scholar, who would perhaps rather wish\r\nhis walks abridged than extended.\" There is a good characteristic\r\naccount of the mode in which the Literati may take exercise, in Pope's\r\nLetters. \"I, like a poor squirrel, am continually in motion indeed, but\r\nit is but a cage of three foot! my little excursions are like those of a\r\nshopkeeper, who walks every day a mile or two before his own door, but\r\nminds his business all the while.\" A turn or two in a garden will often\r\nvery happily close a fine period, mature an unripened thought, and raise\r\nup fresh associations, whenever the mind, like the body, becomes rigid\r\nby preserving the same posture. Buffon often quitted the old tower he\r\nstudied in, which was placed in the midst of his garden, for a walk in\r\nit. Evelyn loved \"books and a garden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The same anecdote is related of Dr. Johnson, who once\r\nbeing at a club where other literary men were indulging in jests, upon\r\nthe entry of a new visitor exclaimed, \"Let us be grave--here is a fool\r\ncoming.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAITS OF AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the ancients, it was undoubtedly a custom to place the portraits of\r\nauthors before their works. Martial's 186th epigram of his fourteenth\r\nbook is a mere play on words, concerning a little volume containing the\r\nworks of Virgil, and which had his portrait prefixed to it. The volume\r\nand the characters must have been very diminutive.\r\n\r\n    _Quam brevis immensum cepit membrana Maronem!\r\n    Ipsius Vultus prima tabella gerit._\r\n\r\nMartial is not the only writer who takes notice of the ancients\r\nprefixing portraits to the works of authors. Seneca, in his ninth\r\nchapter on the Tranquillity of the Soul, complains of many of the\r\nluxurious great, who, like so many of our own collectors, possessed\r\nlibraries as they did their estates and equipages. \"It is melancholy to\r\nobserve how the portraits of men of genius, and the works of their\r\ndivine intelligence, are used only as the luxury and the ornaments of\r\nwalls.\"\r\n\r\nPliny has nearly the same observation, _lib._ xxxv. _cap._ 2. He\r\nremarks, that the custom was rather modern in his time; and attributes\r\nto Asinius Pollio the honour of having introduced it into Rome. \"In\r\nconsecrating a library with the portraits of our illustrious authors, he\r\nhas formed, if I may so express myself, a republic of the intellectual\r\npowers of men.\" To the richness of book-treasures, Asinius Pollio had\r\nassociated a new source of pleasure, by placing the statues of their\r\nauthors amidst them, inspiring the minds of the spectators, even by\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\nA taste for collecting portraits, or busts, was warmly pursued in the\r\nhappier periods of Rome; for the celebrated Atticus, in a work he\r\npublished of illustrious Romans, made it more delightful, by ornamenting\r\nit with the portraits of those great men; and the learned Varro, in his\r\nbiography of Seven Hundred celebrated Men, by giving the world their\r\ntrue features and their physiognomy _in some manner, aliquo modo\r\nimaginibus_ is Pliny's expression, showed that even their persons should\r\nnot entirely be annihilated; they indeed, adds Pliny, form a spectacle\r\nwhich the gods themselves might contemplate; for if the gods sent those\r\nheroes to the earth, it is Varro who secured their immortality, and has\r\nso multiplied and distributed them in all places, that we may carry\r\nthem about us, place them wherever we choose, and fix our eyes on them\r\nwith perpetual admiration. A spectacle that every day becomes more\r\nvaried and interesting, as new heroes appear, and as works of this kind\r\nare spread abroad.\r\n\r\nBut as printing was unknown, to the ancients (though _stamping an\r\nimpression_ was daily practised, and, in fact, they possessed the art of\r\nprinting without being aware of it[22]), how were these portraits of\r\nVarro so easily propagated? If copied with a pen, their correctness was\r\nin some danger, and their diffusion must have been very confined and\r\nslow; perhaps they were outlines. This passage of Pliny excites\r\ncuriosity difficult to satisfy; I have in vain inquired of several\r\nscholars, particularly of the late Grecian, Dr. Burney.\r\n\r\nA collection of the portraits of illustrious characters affords not only\r\na source of entertainment and curiosity, but displays the different\r\nmodes or habits of the time; and in settling our floating ideas upon the\r\ntrue features of famous persons, they also fix the chronological\r\nparticulars of their birth, age, death, sometimes with short characters\r\nof them, besides the names of painter and engraver. It is thus a single\r\nprint, by the hand of a skilful artist, may become a varied banquet. To\r\nthis Granger adds, that in a collection of engraved portraits, the\r\ncontents of many galleries are reduced into the narrow compass of a few\r\nvolumes; and the portraits of eminent persons, who distinguished\r\nthemselves through a long succession of ages, may be turned over in a\r\nfew hours.\r\n\r\n\"Another advantage,\" Granger continues, \"attending such an assemblage\r\nis, that the methodical arrangement has a surprising effect upon the\r\nmemory. We see the celebrated contemporaries of every age almost at one\r\nview; and the mind is insensibly led to the history of that period. I\r\nmay add to these, an important circumstance, which is, the power that\r\nsuch a collection will have in _awakening genius_. A skilful preceptor\r\nwill presently perceive the true bent of the temper of his pupil, by his\r\nbeing struck with a Blake or a Boyle, a Hyde or a Milton.\"\r\n\r\nA circumstance in the life of Cicero confirms this observation. Atticus\r\nhad a gallery adorned with the images or portraits of the great men of\r\nRome, under each of which he had severally described their principal\r\nacts and honours, in a few concise verses of his own composition. It was\r\nby the contemplation of two of these portraits (the ancient Brutus and a\r\nvenerable relative in one picture) that Cicero seems to have incited\r\nBrutus, by the example of these his great ancestors, to dissolve the\r\ntyranny of Cæsar. General Fairfax made a collection of engraved\r\nportraits of warriors. A story much in favour of portrait-collectors is\r\nthat of the Athenian courtesan, who, in the midst of a riotous banquet\r\nwith her lovers, accidentally casting her eyes on the _portrait_ of a\r\nphilosopher that hung opposite to her seat, the happy character of\r\ntemperance and virtue struck her with so lively an image of her own\r\nunworthiness, that she suddenly retreated for ever from the scene of\r\ndebauchery. The Orientalists have felt the same charm in their pictured\r\nmemorials; for \"the imperial Akber,\" says Mr. Forbes, in his Oriental\r\nMemoirs, \"employed artists to make portraits of all the principal omrahs\r\nand officers in his court;\" they were bound together in a thick volume,\r\nwherein, as the Ayeen Akbery, or the Institutes of Akber, expresses it,\r\n\"The PAST are kept in lively remembrance; and the PRESENT are insured\r\nimmortality.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard Aretin, when young and in prison, found a portrait of Petrarch,\r\non which his eyes were perpetually fixed; and this sort of contemplation\r\ninflamed the desire of imitating this great man. Buffon hung the\r\nportrait of Newton before his writing-table.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, Tacitus sublimely expresses himself at the close of his\r\nadmired biography of Agricola: \"I do not mean to censure the custom of\r\npreserving in brass or marble the shape and stature of eminent men; but\r\nbusts and statues, like their originals, are frail and perishable. The\r\nsoul is formed of finer elements, its inward form is not to be expressed\r\nby the hand of an artist with unconscious matter; our manners and our\r\nmorals may in some degree trace the resemblance. All of Agricola that\r\ngained our love and raised our admiration still subsists, and ever will\r\nsubsist, preserved in the minds of men, the register of ages and the\r\nrecords of fame.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is more agreeable to the curiosity of the mind and the eye than the\r\nportraits of great characters? An old philosopher, whom Marville invited\r\nto see a collection of landscapes by a celebrated artist, replied,\r\n\"Landscapes I prefer seeing in the country itself, but I am fond of\r\ncontemplating the pictures of illustrious men.\" This opinion has some\r\ntruth; Lord Orford preferred an interesting portrait to either landscape\r\nor historical painting. \"A landscape, however excellent in its\r\ndistributions of wood, and water, and buildings, leaves not one trace in\r\nthe memory; historical painting is perpetually false in a variety of\r\nways, in the costume, the grouping, the portraits, and is nothing more\r\nthan fabulous painting; but a real portrait is truth itself, and calls\r\nup so many collateral ideas as to fill an intelligent mind more than any\r\nother species.\"\r\n\r\nMarville justly reprehends the fastidious feelings of those ingenious\r\nmen who have resisted the solicitations of the artist, to sit for their\r\nportraits. In them it is sometimes as much pride as it is vanity in\r\nthose who are less difficult in this respect. Of Gray, Fielding, and\r\nAkenside, we have no heads for which they sat; a circumstance regretted\r\nby their admirers, and by physiognomists.\r\n\r\nTo an arranged collection of PORTRAITS, we owe several interesting\r\nworks. Granger's justly esteemed volumes originated in such a\r\ncollection. Perrault's _Eloges_ of \"the illustrious men of the\r\nseventeenth century\" were drawn up to accompany the engraved portraits\r\nof the most celebrated characters of the age, which a fervent love of\r\nthe fine arts and literature had had engraved as an elegant tribute to\r\nthe fame of those great men. They are confined to his nation, as\r\nGranger's to ours. The parent of this race of books may perhaps be the\r\nEulogiums of Paulus Jovius, which originated in a beautiful CABINET,\r\nwhose situation he has described with all its amenity.\r\n\r\nPaulus Jovius had a country house, in an insular situation, of a most\r\nromantic aspect. Built on the ruins of the villa of Pliny, in his time\r\nthe foundations were still to be traced. When the surrounding lake was\r\ncalm, in its lucid bosom were still viewed sculptured marbles, the\r\ntrunks of columns, and the fragments of those pyramids which had once\r\nadorned the residence of the friend of Trajan. Jovius was an enthusiast\r\nof literary leisure: an historian, with the imagination of a poet; a\r\nChristian prelate nourished on the sweet fictions of pagan mythology.\r\nHis pen colours like a pencil. He paints rapturously his gardens bathed\r\nby the waters of the lake, the shade and freshness of his woods, his\r\ngreen hills, his sparkling fountains, the deep silence, and the calm of\r\nsolitude. He describes a statue raised in his gardens to NATURE; in his\r\nhall an Apollo presided with his lyre, and the Muses with their\r\nattributes; his library was guarded by Mercury, and an apartment devoted\r\nto the three Graces was embellished by Doric columns, and paintings of\r\nthe most pleasing kind. Such was the interior! Without, the pure and\r\ntransparent lake spread its broad mirror, or rolled its voluminous\r\nwindings, by banks richly covered with olives and laurels; and in the\r\ndistance, towns, promontories, hills rising in an amphitheatre blushing\r\nwith vines, and the elevations of the Alps covered with woods and\r\npasturage, and sprinkled with herds and flocks.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of this enchanting habitation stood the CABINET, where\r\nPaulus Jovius had collected, at great cost, the PORTRAITS of celebrated\r\nmen of the fourteenth and two succeeding centuries. The daily view of\r\nthem animated his mind to compose their eulogiums. These are still\r\ncurious, both for the facts they preserve, and the happy conciseness\r\nwith which Jovius delineates a character. He had collected these\r\nportraits as others form a collection of natural history; and he pursued\r\nin their characters what others do in their experiments.\r\n\r\nOne caution in collecting portraits must not be forgotten; it respects\r\ntheir authenticity. We have too many supposititious heads, and ideal\r\npersonages. Conrad ab Uffenbach, who seems to have been the first\r\ncollector who projected a methodical arrangement, condemned those\r\nspurious portraits which were fit only for the amusement of children.\r\nThe painter does not always give a correct likeness, or the engraver\r\nmisses it in his copy. Goldsmith was a short thick man, with wan\r\nfeatures and a vulgar appearance, but looks tall and fashionable in a\r\nbag-wig. Bayle's portrait does not resemble him, as one of his friends\r\nwrites. Rousseau, in his Montero cap, is in the same predicament.\r\nWinkelmann's portrait does not preserve the striking physiognomy of the\r\nman, and in the last edition a new one is substituted. The faithful\r\nVertue refused to engrave for Houbraken's set, because they did not\r\nauthenticate their originals; and some of these are spurious, as that of\r\nBen Jonson, Sir Edward Coke, and others. Busts are not so liable to\r\nthese accidents. It is to be regretted that men of genius have not been\r\ncareful to transmit their own portraits to their admirers: it forms a\r\npart of their character; a false delicacy has interfered. Erasmus did\r\nnot like to have his own diminutive person sent down to posterity, but\r\nHolbein was always affectionately painting his friend. Montesquieu once\r\nsat to Dassier the medallist, after repeated denials, won over by the\r\ningenious argument of the artist; \"Do you not think,\" said Dassier,\r\n\"that there is as much pride in refusing my offer as in accepting it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Impressions have been taken from plates engraved by the\r\nancient Egyptians; and one of these, printed by the ordinary\r\nrolling-press, was exhibited at the Great Manchester Exhibition, 1857;\r\nit being for all practical purposes similar to those executed in the\r\npresent day.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe literary treasures of antiquity have suffered from the malice of Men\r\nas well as that of Time. It is remarkable that conquerors, in the moment\r\nof victory, or in the unsparing devastation of their rage, have not been\r\nsatisfied with destroying _men_, but have even carried their vengeance\r\nto _books_.\r\n\r\nThe Persians, from hatred of the religion of the Phoenicians and the\r\nEgyptians, destroyed their books, of which Eusebius notices a great\r\nnumber. A Grecian library at Gnidus was burnt by the sect of\r\nHippocrates, because the Gnidians refused to follow the doctrines of\r\ntheir master. If the followers of Hippocrates formed the majority, was\r\nit not very unorthodox in the Gnidians to prefer taking physic their own\r\nway? But Faction has often annihilated books.\r\n\r\nThe Romans burnt the books of the Jews, of the Christians, and the\r\nPhilosophers; the Jews burnt the books of the Christians and the Pagans;\r\nand the Christians burnt the books of the Pagans and the Jews. The\r\ngreater part of the books of Origen and other heretics were continually\r\nburnt by the orthodox party. Gibbon pathetically describes the empty\r\nlibrary of Alexandria, after the Christians had destroyed it. \"The\r\nvaluable library of Alexandria was pillaged or destroyed; and near\r\ntwenty years afterwards the appearance of the _empty shelves_ excited\r\nthe regret and indignation of every spectator, whose mind was not\r\ntotally darkened by religious prejudice. The compositions of ancient\r\ngenius, so many of which have irretrievably perished, might surely have\r\nbeen excepted from the wreck of idolatry, for the amusement and\r\ninstruction of succeeding ages; and either the zeal or avarice of the\r\narchbishop might have been satiated with the richest spoils which were\r\nthe rewards of his victory.\"\r\n\r\nThe pathetic narrative of Nicetas Choniates, of the ravages committed by\r\nthe Christians of the thirteenth century in Constantinople, was\r\nfraudulently suppressed in the printed editions. It has been preserved\r\nby Dr. Clarke; who observes, that the Turks have committed fewer\r\ninjuries to the works of art than the barbarous Christians of that age.\r\n\r\nThe reading of the Jewish Talmud has been forbidden by various edicts,\r\nof the Emperor Justinian, of many of the French and Spanish kings, and\r\nnumbers of Popes. All the copies were ordered to be burnt: the intrepid\r\nperseverance of the Jews themselves preserved that work from\r\nannihilation. In 1569 twelve thousand copies were thrown into the flames\r\nat Cremona. John Reuchlin interfered to stop this universal destruction\r\nof Talmuds; for which he became hated by the monks, and condemned by the\r\nElector of Mentz, but appealing to Rome, the prosecution was stopped;\r\nand the traditions of the Jews were considered as not necessary to be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nConquerors at first destroy with the rashest zeal the national records\r\nof the conquered people; hence it is that the Irish people deplore the\r\nirreparable losses of their most ancient national memorials, which their\r\ninvaders have been too successful in annihilating. The same event\r\noccurred in the conquest of Mexico; and the interesting history of the\r\nNew World must ever remain imperfect, in consequence of the unfortunate\r\nsuccess of the first missionaries. Clavigero, the most authentic\r\nhistorian of Mexico, continually laments this affecting loss. Everything\r\nin that country had been painted, and painters abounded there as scribes\r\nin Europe. The first missionaries, suspicious that superstition was\r\nmixed with all their paintings, attacked the chief school of these\r\nartists, and collecting, in the market-place, a little mountain of these\r\nprecious records, they set fire to it, and buried in the ashes the\r\nmemory of many interesting events. Afterwards, sensible of their error,\r\nthey tried to collect information from the mouths of the Indians; but\r\nthe Indians were indignantly silent: when they attempted to collect the\r\nremains of these painted histories, the patriotic Mexican usually buried\r\nin concealment the fragmentary records of his country.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Caliph Omar proclaiming throughout the kingdom, at the\r\ntaking of Alexandria, that the Koran contained everything which was\r\nuseful to believe and to know, and therefore he commanded that all the\r\nbooks in the Alexandrian library should be distributed to the masters of\r\nthe baths, amounting to 4000, to be used in heating their stoves during\r\na period of six months, modern paradox would attempt to deny. But the\r\ntale would not be singular even were it true: it perfectly suits the\r\ncharacter of a bigot, a barbarian, and a blockhead. A similar event\r\nhappened in Persia. When Abdoolah, who in the third century of the\r\nMohammedan æra governed Khorassan, was presented at Nishapoor with a MS.\r\nwhich was shown as a literary curiosity, he asked the title of it--it\r\nwas the tale of Wamick and Oozra, composed by the great poet Noshirwan.\r\nOn this Abdoolah observed, that those of his country and faith had\r\nnothing to do with any other book than the Koran; and all Persian MSS.\r\nfound within the circle of his government, as the works of idolaters,\r\nwere to be burnt. Much of the most ancient poetry of the Persians\r\nperished by this fanatical edict.\r\n\r\nWhen Buda was taken by the Turks, a Cardinal offered a vast sum to\r\nredeem the great library founded by Matthew Corvini, a literary monarch\r\nof Hungary: it was rich in Greek and Hebrew lore, and the classics of\r\nantiquity. Thirty amanuenses had been employed in copying MSS. and\r\nilluminating them by the finest art. The barbarians destroyed most of\r\nthe books in tearing away their splendid covers and their silver bosses;\r\nan Hungarian soldier picked up a book as a prize: it proved to be the\r\nEthiopics of Heliodorus, from which the first edition was printed in\r\n1534.\r\n\r\nCardinal Ximenes seems to have retaliated a little on the Saracens; for\r\nat the taking of Granada, he condemned to the flames five thousand\r\nKorans.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote respecting a Spanish missal, called St.\r\nIsidore's, is not incurious; hard fighting saved it from destruction. In\r\nthe Moorish wars, all these missals had been destroyed, excepting those\r\nin the city of Toledo. There, in six churches, the Christians were\r\nallowed the free exercise of their religion. When the Moors were\r\nexpelled several centuries afterwards from Toledo, Alphonsus the Sixth\r\nordered the Roman missal to be used in those churches; but the people of\r\nToledo insisted on having their own, as revised by St. Isidore. It\r\nseemed to them that Alphonsus was more tyrannical than the Turks. The\r\ncontest between the Roman and the Toletan missals came to that height,\r\nthat at length it was determined to decide their fate by single combat;\r\nthe champion of the Toletan missal felled by one blow the knight of the\r\nRoman missal. Alphonsus still considered this battle as merely the\r\neffect of the heavy arm of the doughty Toletan, and ordered a fast to be\r\nproclaimed, and a great fire to be prepared, into which, after his\r\nmajesty and the people had joined in prayer for heavenly assistance in\r\nthis ordeal, both the rivals (not the men, but the missals) were thrown\r\ninto the flames--again St. Isidore's missal triumphed, and this iron\r\nbook was then allowed to be orthodox by Alphonsus, and the good people\r\nof Toledo were allowed to say their prayers as they had long been used\r\nto do. However, the copies of this missal at length became very scarce;\r\nfor now, when no one opposed the reading of St. Isidore's missal, none\r\ncared to use it. Cardinal Ximenes found it so difficult to obtain a\r\ncopy, that he printed a large impression, and built a chapel,\r\nconsecrated to St. Isidore, that this service might be daily chaunted as\r\nit had been by the ancient Christians.\r\n\r\nThe works of the ancients were frequently destroyed at the instigation\r\nof the monks. They appear sometimes to have mutilated them, for passages\r\nhave not come down to us, which once evidently existed; and occasionally\r\ntheir interpolations and other forgeries formed a destruction in a new\r\nshape, by additions to the originals. They were indefatigable in erasing\r\nthe best works of the most eminent Greek and Latin authors, in order to\r\ntranscribe their ridiculous lives of saints on the obliterated vellum.\r\nOne of the books of Livy is in the Vatican most painfully defaced by\r\nsome pious father for the purpose of writing on it some missal or\r\npsalter, and there have been recently others discovered in the same\r\nstate. Inflamed with the blindest zeal against everything pagan, Pope\r\nGregory VII. ordered that the library of the Palatine Apollo, a treasury\r\nof literature formed by successive emperors, should be committed to the\r\nflames! He issued this order under the notion of confining the attention\r\nof the clergy to the holy scriptures! From that time all ancient\r\nlearning which was not sanctioned by the authority of the church, has\r\nbeen emphatically distinguished as _profane_ in opposition to _sacred_.\r\nThis pope is said to have burnt the works of Varro, the learned Roman,\r\nthat Saint Austin should escape from the charge of plagiarism, being\r\ndeeply indebted to Varro for much of his great work \"the City of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, sent by the emperor Ferdinand to proscribe Lutheranism from\r\nBohemia, converted that flourishing kingdom comparatively into a desert.\r\nConvinced that an enlightened people could never be long subservient to\r\na tyrant, they struck one fatal blow at the national literature: every\r\nbook they condemned was destroyed, even those of antiquity; the annals\r\nof the nation were forbidden to be read, and writers were not permitted\r\neven to compose on subjects of Bohemian literature. The mother-tongue\r\nwas held out as a mark of vulgar obscurity, and domiciliary visits were\r\nmade for the purpose of inspecting the libraries of the Bohemians. With\r\ntheir books and their language they lost their national character and\r\ntheir independence.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of libraries in the reign of Henry VIII. at the\r\ndissolution of the monasteries, is wept over by John Bale. Those who\r\npurchased the religious houses took the libraries as part of the booty,\r\nwith which they scoured their furniture, or sold the books as waste\r\npaper, or sent them abroad in ship-loads to foreign bookbinders.[23]\r\n\r\nThe fear of destruction induced many to hide manuscripts under ground,\r\nand in old walls. At the Reformation popular rage exhausted itself on\r\nilluminated books, or MSS. that had red letters in the title page: any\r\nwork that was decorated was sure to be thrown into the flames as a\r\nsuperstitious one. Red letters and embellished figures were sure marks\r\nof being papistical and diabolical. We still find such volumes mutilated\r\nof their gilt letters and elegant initials. Many have been found\r\nunderground, having been forgotten; what escaped the flames were\r\nobliterated by the damp: such is the deplorable fate of books during a\r\npersecution!\r\n\r\nThe puritans burned everything they found which bore the vestige of\r\npopish origin. We have on record many curious accounts of their pious\r\ndepredations, of their maiming images and erasing pictures. The heroic\r\nexpeditions of one Dowsing are journalised by himself: a fanatical\r\nQuixote, to whose intrepid arm many of our noseless saints, sculptured\r\non our Cathedrals, owe their misfortunes.\r\n\r\nThe following are some details from the diary of this redoubtable Goth,\r\nduring his rage for reformation. His entries are expressed with a\r\nlaconic conciseness, and it would seem with a little dry humour. \"At\r\n_Sunbury_, we brake down ten mighty great angels in glass. At _Barham_,\r\nbrake down the twelve apostles in the chancel, and six superstitious\r\npictures more there; and eight in the church, one a lamb with a cross\r\n(+) on the back; and digged down the steps and took up four\r\nsuperstitious inscriptions in brass,\" &c. \"_Lady Bruce's house_, the\r\nchapel, a picture of God the Father, of the Trinity, of Christ, the Holy\r\nGhost, and the cloven tongues, which we gave orders to take down, and\r\nthe lady promised to do it.\" At another place they \"brake six hundred\r\nsuperstitious pictures, eight Holy Ghosts, and three of the Son.\" And in\r\nthis manner he and his deputies scoured one hundred and fifty parishes!\r\nIt has been humorously conjectured, that from this ruthless devastator\r\noriginated the phrase to _give a Dowsing_. Bishop Hall saved the windows\r\nof his chapel at Norwich from destruction, by taking out the heads of\r\nthe figures; and this accounts for the many faces in church windows\r\nwhich we see supplied by white glass.\r\n\r\nIn the various civil wars in our country, numerous libraries have\r\nsuffered both in MSS. and printed books. \"I dare maintain,\" says Fuller,\r\n\"that the wars betwixt York and Lancaster, which lasted sixty years,\r\nwere not so destructive as our modern wars in six years.\" He alludes to\r\nthe parliamentary feuds in the reign of Charles I. \"For during the\r\nformer their differences agreed in the _same religion_, impressing them\r\nwith reverence to all allowed muniments! whilst our _civil wars_,\r\nfounded in _faction_ and _variety_ of pretended _religions_, exposed all\r\nnaked church records a prey to armed violence; a sad vacuum, which will\r\nbe sensible in our _English historie_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was proposed to the great Gustavus of Sweden to destroy the\r\npalace of the Dukes of Bavaria, that hero nobly refused; observing, \"Let\r\nus not copy the example of our unlettered ancestors, who, by waging war\r\nagainst every production of genius, have rendered the name of GOTH\r\nuniversally proverbial of the rudest state of barbarity.\"\r\n\r\nEven the civilisation of the eighteenth century could not preserve from\r\nthe destructive fury of an infuriated mob, in the most polished city of\r\nEurope, the valuable MSS. of the great Earl of Mansfield, which were\r\nmadly consigned to the flames during the riots of 1780; as those of Dr.\r\nPriestley were consumed by the mob at Birmingham.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1599, the Hall of the Stationers underwent as great a\r\npurgation as was carried on in Don Quixote's library. Warton gives a\r\nlist of the best writers who were ordered for immediate conflagration by\r\nthe prelates Whitgift and Bancroft, urged by the Puritanical and\r\nCalvinistic factions. Like thieves and outlaws, they were ordered _to be\r\ntaken wheresoever they may be found_.--\"It was also decreed that no\r\nsatires or epigrams should be printed for the future. No plays were to\r\nbe printed without the inspection and permission of the archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and the bishop of London; nor any _English historyes_, I\r\nsuppose novels and romances, without the sanction of the privy council.\r\nAny pieces of this nature, unlicensed, or now at large and wandering\r\nabroad, were to be diligently sought, recalled, and delivered over to\r\nthe ecclesiastical arm at London-house.\"\r\n\r\nAt a later period, and by an opposite party, among other extravagant\r\nmotions made in parliament, one was to destroy the Records in the Tower,\r\nand to settle the nation on a new foundation! The very same principle\r\nwas attempted to be acted on in the French Revolution by the \"true\r\nsans-culottes.\" With us Sir Matthew Hale showed the weakness of the\r\nproject, and while he drew on his side \"all sober persons, stopped even\r\nthe mouths of the frantic people themselves.\"\r\n\r\nTo descend to the losses incurred by individuals, whose names ought to\r\nhave served as an amulet to charm away the demons of literary\r\ndestruction. One of the most interesting is the fate of Aristotle's\r\nlibrary; he who by a Greek term was first saluted as a collector of\r\nbooks! His works have come down to us accidentally, but not without\r\nirreparable injuries, and with no slight suspicion respecting their\r\nauthenticity. The story is told by Strabo, in his thirteenth book. The\r\nbooks of Aristotle came from his scholar Theophrastus to Neleus, whose\r\nposterity, an illiterate race, kept them locked up without using them,\r\nburied in the earth! Apellion, a curious collector, purchased them, but\r\nfinding the MSS. injured by age and moisture, conjecturally supplied\r\ntheir deficiencies. It is impossible to know how far Apellion has\r\ncorrupted and obscured the text. But the mischief did not end here; when\r\nSylla at the taking of Athens brought them to Rome, he consigned them\r\nto the care of Tyrannio, a grammarian, who employed scribes to copy\r\nthem; he suffered them to pass through his hands without correction, and\r\ntook great freedoms with them; the words of Strabo are strong: \"Ibique\r\nTyrannionem grammaticum iis usum atque (ut fama est) _intercidisse_, aut\r\n_invertisse_.\" He gives it indeed as a report; but the fact seems\r\nconfirmed by the state in which we find these works: Averroes declared\r\nthat he read Aristotle forty times over before he succeeded in perfectly\r\nunderstanding him; he pretends he did at the one-and-fortieth time! And\r\nto prove this, has published five folios of commentary!\r\n\r\nWe have lost much valuable literature by the illiberal or malignant\r\ndescendants of learned and ingenious persons. Many of Lady Mary Wortley\r\nMontague's letters have been destroyed, I am informed, by her daughter,\r\nwho imagined that the family honours were lowered by the addition of\r\nthose of literature: some of her best letters, recently published, were\r\nfound buried in an old trunk. It would have mortified her ladyship's\r\ndaughter to have heard, that her mother was the Sévigné of Britain.\r\n\r\nAt the death of the learned Peiresc, a chamber in his house filled with\r\nletters from the most eminent scholars of the age was discovered: the\r\nlearned in Europe had addressed Peiresc in their difficulties, who was\r\nhence called \"the attorney-general of the republic of letters.\" The\r\nniggardly niece, although repeatedly entreated to permit them to be\r\npublished, preferred to use these learned epistles occasionally to light\r\nher fires![24]\r\n\r\nThe MSS. of Leonardo da Vinci have equally suffered from his relatives.\r\nWhen a curious collector discovered some, he generously brought them to\r\na descendant of the great painter, who coldly observed, that \"he had a\r\ngreat deal more in the garret, which had lain there for many years, if\r\nthe rats had not destroyed them!\" Nothing which this great artist wrote\r\nbut showed an inventive genius.\r\n\r\nMenage observes on a friend having had his library destroyed by fire, in\r\nwhich several valuable MSS. had perished, that such a loss is one of the\r\ngreatest misfortunes that can happen to a man of letters. This gentleman\r\nafterwards consoled himself by composing a little treatise _De\r\nBibliothecæ incendio_. It must have been sufficiently curious. Even in\r\nthe present day men of letters are subject to similar misfortunes; for\r\nthough the fire-offices will insure books, they will not allow _authors\r\nto value their own manuscripts_.\r\n\r\nA fire in the Cottonian library shrivelled and destroyed many\r\nAnglo-Saxon MSS.--a loss now irreparable. The antiquary is doomed to\r\nspell hard and hardly at the baked fragments that crumble in his\r\nhand.[25]\r\n\r\nMeninsky's famous Persian dictionary met with a sad fate. Its excessive\r\nrarity is owing to the siege of Vienna by the Turks: a bomb fell on the\r\nauthor's house, and consumed the principal part of his indefatigable\r\nlabours. There are few sets of this high-priced work which do not bear\r\nevident proofs of the bomb; while many parts are stained with the water\r\nsent to quench the flames.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of an author for the loss of his manuscripts strongly\r\nappear in the case of Anthony Urceus, a great scholar of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The loss of his papers seems immediately to have been followed\r\nby madness. At Forli, he had an apartment in the palace, and had\r\nprepared an important work for publication. His room was dark, and he\r\ngenerally wrote by lamp-light. Having gone out, he left the lamp\r\nburning; the papers soon kindled, and his library was reduced to ashes.\r\nAs soon as he heard the news, he ran furiously to the palace, and\r\nknocking his head violently against the gate, uttered this blasphemous\r\nlanguage: \"Jesus Christ, what great crime have I done! who of those who\r\nbelieved in you have I ever treated so cruelly? Hear what I am saying,\r\nfor I am in earnest, and am resolved. If by chance I should be so weak\r\nas to address myself to you at the point of death, don't hear me, for I\r\nwill not be with you, but prefer hell and its eternity of torments.\" To\r\nwhich, by the by, he gave little credit. Those who heard these ravings,\r\nvainly tried to console him. He quitted the town, and lived franticly,\r\nwandering about the woods!\r\n\r\nBen Jonson's _Execration on Vulcan_ was composed on a like occasion; the\r\nfruits of twenty years' study were consumed in one short hour; our\r\nliterature suffered, for among some works of imagination there were many\r\nphilosophical collections, a commentary on the poetics, a complete\r\ncritical grammar, a life of Henry V., his journey into Scotland, with\r\nall his adventures in that poetical pilgrimage, and a poem on the ladies\r\nof Great Britain. What a catalogue of losses!\r\n\r\nCastelvetro, the Italian commentator on Aristotle, having heard that his\r\nhouse was on fire, ran through the streets exclaiming to the people,\r\n_alla Poetica! alla Poetica! To the Poetic! To the Poetic_! He was then\r\nwriting his commentary on the Poetics of Aristotle.\r\n\r\nSeveral men of letters have been known to have risen from their\r\ndeath-bed to destroy their MSS. So solicitous have they been not to\r\nventure their posthumous reputation in the hands of undiscerning\r\nfriends. Colardeau, the elegant versifier of Pope's epistle of Eliosa to\r\nAbelard, had not yet destroyed what he had written of a translation of\r\nTasso. At the approach of death, he recollected his unfinished labour;\r\nhe knew that his friends would not have the courage to annihilate one of\r\nhis works; this was reserved for him. Dying, he raised himself, and as\r\nif animated by an honourable action, he dragged himself along, and with\r\ntrembling hands seized his papers, and consumed them in one\r\nsacrifice.--I recollect another instance of a man of letters, of our own\r\ncountry, who acted the same part. He had passed his life in constant\r\nstudy, and it was observed that he had written several folio volumes,\r\nwhich his modest fears would not permit him to expose to the eye even of\r\nhis critical friends. He promised to leave his labours to posterity; and\r\nhe seemed sometimes, with a glow on his countenance, to exult that they\r\nwould not be unworthy of their acceptance. At his death his sensibility\r\ntook the alarm; he had the folios brought to his bed; no one could open\r\nthem, for they were closely locked. At the sight of his favourite and\r\nmysterious labours, he paused; he seemed disturbed in his mind, while he\r\nfelt at every moment his strength decaying; suddenly he raised his\r\nfeeble hands by an effort of firm resolve, burnt his papers, and smiled\r\nas the greedy Vulcan licked up every page. The task exhausted his\r\nremaining strength, and he soon afterwards expired. The late Mrs.\r\nInchbald had written her life in several volumes; on her death-bed, from\r\na motive perhaps of too much delicacy to admit of any argument, she\r\nrequested a friend to cut them into pieces before her eyes--not having\r\nsufficient strength left herself to perform this funereal office. These\r\nare instances of what may be called the heroism of authors.\r\n\r\nThe republic of letters has suffered irreparable losses by shipwrecks.\r\nGuarino Veronese, one of those learned Italians who travelled through\r\nGreece for the recovery of MSS., had his perseverance repaid by the\r\nacquisition of many valuable works. On his return to Italy he was\r\nshipwrecked, and lost his treasures! So poignant was his grief on this\r\noccasion that, according to the relation of one of his countrymen, his\r\nhair turned suddenly white.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1700, Hudde, an opulent burgomaster of Middleburgh,\r\nanimated solely by literary curiosity, went to China to instruct himself\r\nin the language, and in whatever was remarkable in this singular people.\r\nHe acquired the skill of a mandarine in that difficult language; nor did\r\nthe form of his Dutch face undeceive the physiognomists of China. He\r\nsucceeded to the dignity of a mandarine; he travelled through the\r\nprovinces under this character, and returned to Europe with a collection\r\nof observations, the cherished labour of thirty years, and all these\r\nwere sunk in the bottomless sea.\r\n\r\nThe great Pinellian library, after the death of its illustrious\r\npossessor, filled three vessels to be conveyed to Naples. Pursued by\r\ncorsairs, one of the vessels was taken; but the pirates finding nothing\r\non board but books, they threw them all into the sea: such was the fate\r\nof a great portion of this famous library.[26] National libraries have\r\noften perished at sea, from the circumstance of conquerors transporting\r\nthem into their own kingdoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Henry gave a commission to the famous antiquary, John\r\nLeland, to examine the libraries of the suppressed religious houses, and\r\npreserve such as concerned history. Though Leland, after his search,\r\ntold the king he had \"conserved many good authors, the which otherwyse\r\nhad bene lyke to have peryshed, to the no smal incommodite of good\r\nletters,\" he owns to the ruthless destruction of all such as were\r\nconnected with the \"doctryne of a rowt of Romayne bysshopps.\" Strype\r\nconsequently notes with great sorrow that many \"ancient manuscripts and\r\nwritings of learned British and Saxon authors were lost. Libraries were\r\nsold by mercenary men for anything they could get, in that confusion and\r\ndevastation of religious houses. Bale, the antiquary, makes mention of a\r\nmerchant that bought two noble libraries about these times for forty\r\nshillings; the books whereof served him for no other use but for waste\r\npaper; and that he had been ten years consuming them, and yet there\r\nremained still store enough for as many years more. Vast quantities and\r\nnumbers of these books vanished with the monks and friars from their\r\nmonasteries, were conveyed away and carried beyond seas to booksellers\r\nthere, by whole ship ladings; and a great many more were used in shops\r\nand kitchens.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: One of the most disastrous of these losses to the admirers\r\nof the old drama occurred through the neglect of a collector--John\r\nWarburton, Somerset herald-at-arms (who died 1759), and who had many of\r\nthese early plays in manuscript. They were left carelessly in a corner,\r\nand during his absence his cook used them for culinary purposes as waste\r\npaper. The list published of his losses is, however, not quite accurate,\r\nas one or more escaped, or were mislaid by this careless man; for\r\nMassinger's tragedy, _The Tyrant_, stated to have been so destroyed, was\r\nfound among his books, and sold at his sale in 1759; another play by the\r\nsame author, _Believe as You List_, was discovered among some papers\r\nfrom Garrick's library in 1844, and was printed by the Percy Society,\r\n1849. It appears to be the very manuscript copy seen and described by\r\nCibber and Chetwood.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: One of these shrivelled volumes is preserved in a case in\r\nour British Museum. The leaves have been twisted and drawn almost into a\r\nsolid ball by the action of fire. Some few of the charred manuscripts\r\nhave been admirably restored of late years by judicious pressure, and\r\ninlaying the damaged leaves in solid margins. The fire occurred while\r\nthe collection was temporarily placed in Ashburnham House, Little Dean's\r\nYard, Westminster, in October, 1731. From the Report published by a\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons soon after, it appears that the\r\noriginal number of volumes was 958--\"of which are lost, burnt, or\r\nentirely spoiled, 114; and damaged so as to be defective, 98.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Gianvincenzo Pinelli was descended from a noble Genoese\r\nfamily, and born at Naples in 1535. At the age of twenty-three he\r\nremoved to Padua, then noted for its learning, and here he devoted his\r\ntime and fortune to literary and scientific pursuits. There was scarcely\r\na branch of knowledge that he did not cultivate; and at his death, in\r\n1601, he left a noble library behind him. But the Senate of Venice, ever\r\nfearful that an undue knowledge of its proceedings should be made\r\npublic, set their seal upon his collection of manuscripts, and took away\r\nmore than two hundred volumes which related in some degree to its\r\naffairs. The rest of the books were packed to go to Naples, where his\r\nheirs resided. The printed books are stated to have filled one hundred\r\nand sixteen chests, and the manuscripts were contained in fourteen\r\nothers. Three ships were freighted with them. One fell into the hands of\r\ncorsairs, and the contents were destroyed, as stated in the text; some\r\nof the books, scattered on the beach at Fermo, were purchased by the\r\nBishop there. The other ship-loads were ultimately obtained by Cardinal\r\nBorromeo, and added to his library.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME NOTICES OF LOST WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it is the opinion of some critics that our literary losses do\r\nnot amount to the extent which others imagine, they are however much\r\ngreater than they allow. Our severest losses are felt in the historical\r\nprovince, and particularly in the earliest records, which might not have\r\nbeen the least interesting to philosophical curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe history of Phoenicia by Sanchoniathon, supposed to be a contemporary\r\nwith Solomon, now consists of only a few valuable fragments preserved by\r\nEusebius. The same ill fortune attends Manetho's history of Egypt, and\r\nBerosu's history of Chaldea. The histories of these most ancient\r\nnations, however veiled in fables, would have presented to the\r\nphilosopher singular objects of contemplation.\r\n\r\nOf the history of Polybios, which once contained forty books, we have\r\nnow only five; of the historical library of Diodorus Siculus fifteen\r\nbooks only remain out of forty; and half of the Roman antiquities of\r\nDionysius Helicarnassensis has perished. Of the eighty books of the\r\nhistory of Dion Cassius, twenty-five only remain. The present opening\r\nbook of Ammianus Marcellinus is entitled the fourteenth. Livy's history\r\nconsisted of one hundred and forty books, and we only possess\r\nthirty-five of that pleasing historian. What a treasure has been lost in\r\nthe thirty books of Tacitus! little more than four remain. Murphy\r\nelegantly observes, that \"the reign of Titus, the delight of human kind,\r\nis totally lost, and Domitian has escaped the vengeance of the\r\nhistorian's pen.\" Yet Tacitus in fragments is still the colossal torso\r\nof history. Velleius Paterculas, of whom a fragment only has reached\r\nus, we owe to a single copy: no other having ever been discovered, and\r\nwhich has occasioned the text of this historian to remain incurably\r\ncorrupt. Taste and criticism have certainly incurred an irreparable loss\r\nin that _Treatise on the Causes of the Corruption of Eloquence_, by\r\nQuintilian; which he has himself noticed with so much satisfaction in\r\nhis \"Institutes.\" Petrarch declares, that in his youth he had seen the\r\nworks of Varro, and the second Decad of Livy; but all his endeavours to\r\nrecover them were fruitless.\r\n\r\nThese are only some of the most known losses; but in reading\r\ncontemporary writers we are perpetually discovering many important ones.\r\nWe have lost two precious works in ancient biography: Varro wrote the\r\nlives of seven hundred illustrious Romans; and Atticus, the friend of\r\nCicero, composed another, on the acts of the great men among the Romans.\r\nWhen we consider that these writers lived familiarly with the finest\r\ngeniuses of their times, and were opulent, hospitable, and lovers of the\r\nfine arts, their biography and their portraits, which are said to have\r\naccompanied them, are felt as an irreparable loss to literature. I\r\nsuspect likewise we have had great losses of which we are not always\r\naware; for in that curious letter in which the younger Pliny describes\r\nin so interesting a manner the sublime industry, for it seems sublime by\r\nits magnitude, of his Uncle,[27] it appears that his Natural History,\r\nthat vast register of the wisdom and the credulity of the ancients, was\r\nnot his only great labour; for among his other works was a history in\r\ntwenty books, which has entirely perished. We discover also the works of\r\nwriters, which, by the accounts of them, appear to have equalled in\r\ngenius those which have descended to us. Pliny has feelingly described a\r\npoet of whom he tells us, \"his works are never out of my hands; and\r\nwhether I sit down to write anything myself, or to revise what I have\r\nalready wrote, or am in a disposition to amuse myself, I constantly take\r\nup this agreeable author; and as often as I do so, he is still new.\"[28]\r\nHe had before compared this poet to Catullus; and in a critic of so fine\r\na taste as Pliny, to have cherished so constant an intercourse with the\r\nwritings of this author, indicates high powers. Instances of this kind\r\nfrequently occur. Who does not regret the loss of the Anticato of\r\nCæsar?\r\n\r\nThe losses which the poetical world has sustained are sufficiently known\r\nby those who are conversant with the few invaluable fragments of\r\nMenander, who might have interested us perhaps more than Homer: for he\r\nwas evidently the domestic poet, and the lyre he touched was formed of\r\nthe strings of the human heart. He was the painter of passions, and the\r\nhistorian of the manners. The opinion of Quintilian is confirmed by the\r\ngolden fragments preserved for the English reader in the elegant\r\nversions of Cumberland. Even of Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, who\r\neach wrote about one hundred dramas, seven only have been preserved of\r\nÆschylus and of Sophocles, and nineteen of Euripides. Of the one hundred\r\nand thirty comedies of Plautus, we only inherit twenty imperfect ones.\r\nThe remainder of Ovid's Fasti has never been recovered.\r\n\r\nI believe that a philosopher would consent to lose any poet to regain an\r\nhistorian; nor is this unjust, for some future poet may arise to supply\r\nthe vacant place of a lost poet, but it is not so with the historian.\r\nFancy may be supplied; but Truth once lost in the annals of mankind\r\nleaves a chasm never to be filled.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Book III. Letter V. Melmoth's translation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Book I. Letter XVI.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUODLIBETS, OR SCHOLASTIC DISQUISITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scholastic questions were called _Questiones Quodlibeticæ_; and they\r\nwere generally so ridiculous that we have retained the word _Quodlibet_\r\nin our vernacular style, to express anything ridiculously subtile;\r\nsomething which comes at length to be distinguished into nothingness,\r\n\r\n    \"With all the rash dexterity of wit.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the scholastic philosophy furnishes an instructive theme;\r\nit enters into the history of the human mind, and fills a niche in our\r\nliterary annals. The works of the scholastics, with the debates of these\r\n_Quodlibetarians_, at once show the greatness and the littleness of the\r\nhuman intellect; for though they often degenerate into incredible\r\nabsurdities, those who have examined the works of Thomas Aquinas and\r\nDuns Scotus have confessed their admiration of the Herculean texture of\r\nbrain which they exhausted in demolishing their aërial fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe following is a slight sketch of the school divinity.\r\n\r\nThe christian doctrines in the primitive ages of the gospel were adapted\r\nto the simple comprehension of the multitude; metaphysical subtilties\r\nwere not even employed by the Fathers, of whom several are eloquent. The\r\nHomilies explained, by an obvious interpretation, some scriptural point,\r\nor inferred, by artless illustration, some moral doctrine. When the\r\nArabians became the only learned people, and their empire extended over\r\nthe greater part of the known world, they impressed their own genius on\r\nthose nations with whom they were allied as friends, or reverenced as\r\nmasters. The Arabian genius was fond of abstruse studies; it was highly\r\nmetaphysical and mathematical, for the fine arts their religion did not\r\npermit them to cultivate; and the first knowledge which modern Europe\r\nobtained of Euclid and Aristotle was through the medium of Latin\r\ntranslations of Arabic versions. The Christians in the west received\r\ntheir first lessons from the Arabians in the east; and Aristotle, with\r\nhis Arabic commentaries, was enthroned in the schools of Christendom.\r\n\r\nThen burst into birth, from the dark cave of metaphysics, a numerous and\r\nugly spawn of monstrous sects; unnatural children of the same foul\r\nmother, who never met but for mutual destruction. Religion became what\r\nis called the study of Theology; and they all attempted to reduce the\r\nworship of God into a system! and the creed into a thesis! Every point\r\nrelating to religion was debated through an endless chain of infinite\r\nquestions, incomprehensible distinctions, with differences mediate and\r\nimmediate, the concrete and the abstract, a perpetual civil war carried\r\non against common sense in all the Aristotelian severity. There existed\r\na rage for Aristotle; and Melancthon complains that in sacred assemblies\r\nthe ethics of Aristotle were read to the people instead of the gospel.\r\nAristotle was placed a-head of St. Paul; and St. Thomas Aquinas in his\r\nworks distinguishes him by the title of \"The Philosopher;\" inferring,\r\ndoubtless, that no other man could possibly be a philosopher who\r\ndisagreed with Aristotle. Of the blind rites paid to Aristotle, the\r\nanecdotes of the Nominalists and Realists are noticed in the article\r\n\"Literary Controversy\" in this work.\r\n\r\nHad their subtile questions and perpetual wranglings only been addressed\r\nto the metaphysician in his closet, and had nothing but strokes of the\r\npen occurred, the scholastic divinity would only have formed an episode\r\nin the calm narrative of literary history; but it has claims to be\r\nregistered in political annals, from the numerous persecutions and\r\ntragical events with which they too long perplexed their followers, and\r\ndisturbed the repose of Europe. The Thomists, and the Scotists, the\r\nOccamites, and many others, soared into the regions of mysticism.\r\n\r\nPeter Lombard had laboriously compiled, after the celebrated Abelard's\r\n\"Introduction to Divinity,\" his four books of \"Sentences,\" from the\r\nwritings of the Fathers; and for this he is called \"The Master of\r\nSentences.\" These Sentences, on which we have so many commentaries, are\r\na collection of passages from the Fathers, the real or apparent\r\ncontradictions of whom he endeavours to reconcile. But his successors\r\nwere not satisfied to be mere commentators on these \"sentences,\" which\r\nthey now only made use of as a row of pegs to hang on their fine-spun\r\nmetaphysical cobwebs. They at length collected all these quodlibetical\r\nquestions into enormous volumes, under the terrifying form, for those\r\nwho have seen them, of _Summaries of Divinity_! They contrived, by their\r\nchimerical speculations, to question the plainest truths; to wrest the\r\nsimple meaning of the Holy Scriptures, and give some appearance of truth\r\nto the most ridiculous and monstrous opinions.\r\n\r\nOne of the subtile questions which agitated the world in the tenth\r\ncentury, relating to dialectics, was concerning _universals_ (as for\r\nexample, man, horse, dog, &c.) signifying not _this_ or _that_ in\r\nparticular, but _all_ in general. They distinguished _universals_, or\r\nwhat we call abstract terms, by the _genera_ and _species rerum_; and\r\nthey never could decide whether these were _substances_--or _names_!\r\nThat is, whether the abstract idea we form of a horse was not really a\r\n_being_ as much as the horse we ride! All this, and some congenial\r\npoints respecting the origin of our ideas, and what ideas were, and\r\nwhether we really had an idea of a thing before we discovered the thing\r\nitself--in a word, what they called universals, and the essence of\r\nuniversals; of all this nonsense, on which they at length proceeded to\r\naccusations of heresy, and for which many learned men were\r\nexcommunicated, stoned, and what not, the whole was derived from the\r\nreveries of Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno, about the nature of ideas, than\r\nwhich subject to the present day no discussion ever degenerated into\r\nsuch insanity. A modern metaphysician infers that we have no ideas at\r\nall!\r\n\r\nOf the scholastic divines, the most illustrious was Saint THOMAS\r\nAQUINAS, styled the Angelical Doctor. Seventeen folio volumes not only\r\ntestify his industry but even his genius. He was a great man, busied all\r\nhis life with making the charades of metaphysics.\r\n\r\nMy learned friend Sharon Turner has favoured me with a notice of his\r\ngreatest work--his \"Sum of all Theology,\" _Summa totius Theologiæ_,\r\nParis, 1615. It is a metaphysicological treatise, or the most abstruse\r\nmetaphysics of theology. It occupies above 1250 folio pages, of very\r\nsmall close print in double columns. It may be worth noticing that to\r\nthis work are appended 19 folio pages of double columns of errata, and\r\nabout 200 of additional index!\r\n\r\nThe whole is thrown into an Aristotelian form; the difficulties or\r\nquestions are proposed first, and the answers are then appended. There\r\nare 168 articles on Love--358 on Angels--200 on the Soul--85 on\r\nDemons--151 on the Intellect--134 on Law--3 on the Catamenia--237 on\r\nSins--17 on Virginity, and others on a variety of topics.\r\n\r\nThe scholastic tree is covered with prodigal foliage, but is barren of\r\nfruit; and when the scholastics employed themselves in solving the\r\ndeepest mysteries, their philosophy became nothing more than an\r\ninstrument in the hands of the Roman Pontiff. Aquinas has composed 358\r\narticles on angels, of which a few of the heads have been culled for the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nHe treats of angels, their substance, orders, offices, natures, habits,\r\n&c., as if he himself had been an old experienced angel!\r\n\r\nAngels were not before the world!\r\n\r\nAngels might have been before the world!\r\n\r\nAngels were created by God--They were created immediately by Him--They\r\nwere created in the Empyrean sky--They were created in grace--They were\r\ncreated in imperfect beatitude. After a severe chain of reasoning, he\r\nshows that angels are incorporeal compared to us, but corporeal compared\r\nto God.\r\n\r\nAn angel is composed of action and potentiality; the more superior he\r\nis, he has the less potentiality. They have not matter properly. Every\r\nangel differs from another angel in species. An angel is of the same\r\nspecies as a soul. Angels have not naturally a body united to them. They\r\nmay assume bodies; but they do not want to assume bodies for themselves,\r\nbut for us.\r\n\r\nThe bodies assumed by angels are of thick air.\r\n\r\nThe bodies they assume have not the natural virtues which they show, nor\r\nthe operations of life, but those which are common to inanimate things.\r\n\r\nAn angel may be the same with a body.\r\n\r\nIn the same body there are, the soul formally giving being, and\r\noperating natural operations; and the angel operating supernatural\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nAngels administer and govern every corporeal creature.\r\n\r\nGod, an angel, and the soul, are not contained in space, but contain it.\r\n\r\nMany angels cannot be in the same space.\r\n\r\nThe motion of an angel in space is nothing else than different contacts\r\nof different successive places.\r\n\r\nThe motion of an angel is a succession of his different operations.\r\n\r\nHis motion may be continuous and discontinuous as he will.\r\n\r\nThe continuous motion of an angel is necessary through every medium, but\r\nmay be discontinuous without a medium.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of the motion of an angel is not according to the quantity\r\nof his strength, but according to his will.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the illumination of an angel is threefold, or circular,\r\nstraight, and oblique.\r\n\r\nIn this account of the motion of an angel we are reminded of the\r\nbeautiful description of Milton, who marks it by a continuous motion,\r\n\r\n    \"Smooth-sliding without step.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader desirous of being _merry_ with Aquinas's angels may find them\r\nin Martinus Scriblerus, in Ch. VII. who inquires if angels pass from one\r\nextreme to another without going through the _middle_? And if angels\r\nknow things more clearly in a morning? How many angels can dance on the\r\npoint of a very fine needle, without jostling one another?\r\n\r\nAll the questions in Aquinas are answered with a subtlety of distinction\r\nmore difficult to comprehend and remember than many problems in Euclid;\r\nand perhaps a few of the best might still be selected for youth as\r\ncurious exercises of the understanding. However, a great part of these\r\npeculiar productions are loaded with the most trifling, irreverent, and\r\neven scandalous discussions. Even Aquinas could gravely debate, Whether\r\nChrist was not an hermaphrodite? Whether there are excrements in\r\nParadise? Whether the pious at the resurrection will rise with their\r\nbowels? Others again debated--Whether the angel Gabriel appeared to the\r\nVirgin Mary in the shape of a serpent, of a dove, of a man, or of a\r\nwoman? Did he seem to be young or old? In what dress was he? Was his\r\ngarment white or of two colours? Was his linen clean or foul? Did he\r\nappear in the morning, noon, or evening? What was the colour of the\r\nVirgin Mary's hair? Was she acquainted with the mechanic and liberal\r\narts? Had she a thorough knowledge of the Book of Sentences, and all it\r\ncontains? that is, Peter Lombard's compilation from the works of the\r\nFathers, written 1200 years after her death.--But these are only\r\ntrifling matters: they also agitated, Whether when during her conception\r\nthe Virgin was seated, Christ too was seated; and whether when she lay\r\ndown, Christ also lay down? The following question was a favourite topic\r\nfor discussion, and the acutest logicians never resolved it: \"When a hog\r\nis carried to market with a rope tied about his neck, which is held at\r\nthe other end by a man, whether is the _hog_ carried to market by the\r\n_rope_ or the _man_?\"\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century[29], after long and ineffectual controversy about\r\nthe real presence of Christ in the Sacrament, they at length universally\r\nagreed to sign a peace. This mutual forbearance must not, however, be\r\nascribed to the prudence and virtue of those times. It was mere\r\nignorance and incapacity of reasoning which kept the peace, and deterred\r\nthem from entering into debates to which they at length found themselves\r\nunequal!\r\n\r\nLord Lyttleton, in his Life of Henry II., laments the unhappy effects of\r\nthe scholastic philosophy on the progress of the human mind. The minds\r\nof men were turned from classical studies to the subtilties of school\r\ndivinity, which Rome encouraged, as more profitable for the maintenance\r\nof her doctrines. It was a great misfortune to religion and to learning,\r\nthat men of such acute understandings as Abelard and Lombard, who might\r\nhave done much to reform the errors of the church, and to restore\r\nscience in Europe, should have depraved both, by applying their\r\nadmirable parts to weave those cobwebs of sophistry, and to confound the\r\nclear simplicity of evangelical truths, by a false philosophy and a\r\ncaptious logic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Jortin's _Remarks on Ecclesiastical History_, vol. v. p.\r\n17.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAME CONTEMNED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll men are fond of glory, and even those philosophers who write against\r\nthat noble passion prefix their _names_ to their own works. It is worthy\r\nof observation that the authors of two _religious books_, universally\r\nreceived, have concealed their names from the world. The \"Imitation of\r\nChrist\" is attributed, without any authority, to Thomas A'Kempis; and\r\nthe author of the \"Whole Duty of Man\" still remains undiscovered.\r\nMillions of their books have been dispersed in the Christian world.\r\n\r\nTo have revealed their _names_ would have given them as much worldly\r\nfame as any moralist has obtained--but they contemned it! Their religion\r\nwas raised above all worldly passions! Some profane writers, indeed,\r\nhave also concealed their names to great works, but their _motives_ were\r\nof a very different cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIX FOLLIES OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is so capable of disordering the intellects as an intense\r\napplication to any one of these six things: the Quadrature of the\r\nCircle; the Multiplication of the Cube; the Perpetual Motion; the\r\nPhilosophical Stone; Magic; and Judicial Astrology. \"It is proper,\r\nhowever,\" Fontenelle remarks, \"to apply one's self to these inquiries;\r\nbecause we find, as we proceed, many valuable discoveries of which we\r\nwere before ignorant.\" The same thought Cowley has applied, in an\r\naddress to his mistress, thus--\r\n\r\n    \"Although I think thou never wilt be found,\r\n      Yet I'm resolved to search for thee:\r\n        The search itself rewards the pains.\r\n          So though the chymist his great secret miss,\r\n    (For neither it in art nor nature is)\r\n      Yet things well worth his toil he gains;\r\n    And does his charge and labour pay\r\n    With good unsought experiments by the way.\"\r\n\r\nThe same thought is in Donne; perhaps Cowley did not suspect that he was\r\nan imitator; Fontenelle could not have read either; he struck out the\r\nthought by his own reflection, Glauber searched long and deeply for the\r\nphilosopher's stone, which though he did not find, yet in his researches\r\nhe discovered a very useful purging salt, which bears his name.\r\n\r\nMaupertuis observes on the _Philosophical Stone_, that we cannot prove\r\nthe impossibility of obtaining it, but we can easily see the folly of\r\nthose who employ their time and money in seeking for it. This price is\r\ntoo great to counterbalance the little probability of succeeding in it.\r\nHowever, it is still a bantling of modern chemistry, who has nodded very\r\naffectionately on it!--Of the _Perpetual Motion_, he shows the\r\nimpossibility, in the sense in which it is generally received. On the\r\n_Quadrature of the Circle_, he says he cannot decide if this problem be\r\nresolvable or not: but he observes, that it is very useless to search\r\nfor it any more; since we have arrived by approximation to such a point\r\nof accuracy, that on a large circle, such as the orbit which the earth\r\ndescribes round the sun, the geometrician will not mistake by the\r\nthickness of a hair. The quadrature of the circle is still, however, a\r\nfavourite game with some visionaries, and several are still imagining\r\nthat they have discovered the perpetual motion; the Italians nickname\r\nthem _matto perpetuo_: and Bekker tells us of the fate of one Hartmann,\r\nof Leipsic, who was in such despair at having passed his life so vainly,\r\nin studying the perpetual motion, that at length he hanged himself!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMITATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome writers, usually pedants, imagine that they can supply, by the\r\nlabours of industry, the deficiencies of nature. Paulus Manutius\r\nfrequently spent a month in writing a single letter. He affected to\r\nimitate Cicero. But although he painfully attained to something of the\r\nelegance of his style, destitute of the native graces of unaffected\r\ncomposition, he was one of those whom Erasmus bantered in his\r\n_Ciceronianus_, as so slavishly devoted to Cicero's style, that they\r\nridiculously employed the utmost precautions when they were seized by a\r\nCiceronian fit. The _Nosoponus_ of Erasmus tells of his devotion to\r\nCicero; of his three indexes to all his words, and his never writing but\r\nin the dead of night, employing months upon a few lines; and his\r\nreligious veneration for _words_, with his total indifference about the\r\n_sense_.\r\n\r\nLe Brun, a Jesuit, was a singular instance of such unhappy imitation. He\r\nwas a Latin poet, and his themes were religious. He formed the\r\nextravagant project of substituting a _religious Virgil_ and _Ovid_\r\nmerely by adapting his works to their titles. His _Christian Virgil_\r\nconsists, like the Pagan Virgil, of _Eclogues_, _Georgics_, and of an\r\n_Epic_ of twelve books; with this difference, that devotional subjects\r\nare substituted for fabulous ones. His epic is the _Ignaciad_, or the\r\npilgrimage of Saint Ignatius. His _Christian Ovid_, is in the same\r\ntaste; everything wears a new face. His _Epistles_ are pious ones; the\r\n_Fasti_ are the six days of the Creation; the _Elegies_ are the six\r\nLamentations of Jeremiah; a poem on _the Love of God_ is substituted for\r\nthe _Art of Love_; and the history of some _Conversions_ supplies the\r\nplace of the _Metamorphoses_! This Jesuit would, no doubt, have approved\r\nof a _family Shakspeare_!\r\n\r\nA poet of a far different character, the elegant Sannazarius, has done\r\nmuch the same thing in his poem _De Partu Virginis_. The same servile\r\nimitation of ancient taste appears. It professes to celebrate the birth\r\nof _Christ_, yet his name is not once mentioned in it! The _Virgin_\r\nherself is styled _spes deorum_! \"The hope of the gods!\" The\r\n_Incarnation_ is predicted by _Proteus_! The Virgin, instead of\r\nconsulting the _sacred writings_, reads the _Sibylline oracles_! Her\r\nattendants are _dryads_, _nereids_, &c. This monstrous mixture of\r\npolytheism with the mysteries of Christianity, appears in everything he\r\nhad about him. In a chapel at one of his country seats he had two\r\nstatues placed at his tomb, _Apollo_ and _Minerva_; catholic piety found\r\nno difficulty in the present case, as well as in innumerable others of\r\nthe same kind, to inscribe the statue of _Apollo_ with the name of\r\n_David_, and that of _Minerva_ with the female one of _Judith_!\r\n\r\nSeneca, in his 114th Epistle, gives a curious literary anecdote of the\r\nsort of imitation by which an inferior mind becomes the monkey of an\r\noriginal writer. At Rome, when Sallust was the fashionable writer, short\r\nsentences, uncommon words, and an obscure brevity, were affected as so\r\nmany elegances. Arruntius, who wrote the history of the Punic Wars,\r\npainfully laboured to imitate Sallust. Expressions which are rare in\r\nSallust are frequent in Arruntius, and, of course, without the motive\r\nthat induced Sallust to adopt them. What rose naturally under the pen of\r\nthe great historian, the minor one must have run after with ridiculous\r\nanxiety. Seneca adds several instances of the servile affectation of\r\nArruntius, which seem much like those we once had of Johnson, by the\r\nundiscerning herd of his apes.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but smile at these imitators; we have abounded with them. In\r\nthe days of Churchill, every month produced an effusion which tolerably\r\nimitated his slovenly versification, his coarse invective, and his\r\ncareless mediocrity,--but the genius remained with the English Juvenal.\r\nSterne had his countless multitude; and in Fielding's time, Tom Jones\r\nproduced more bastards in wit than the author could ever suspect. To\r\nsuch literary echoes, the reply of Philip of Macedon to one who prided\r\nhimself on imitating the notes of the nightingale may be applied: \"I\r\nprefer the nightingale herself!\" Even the most successful of this\r\nimitating tribe must be doomed to share the fate of Silius Italicus, in\r\nhis cold imitation of Virgil, and Cawthorne in his empty harmony of\r\nPope.\r\n\r\nTo all these imitators I must apply an Arabian anecdote. Ebn Saad, one\r\nof Mahomet's amanuenses, when writing what the prophet dictated, cried\r\nout by way of admiration--\"Blessed be God, the best Creator!\" Mahomet\r\napproved of the expression, and desired him to write those words down as\r\npart of the inspired passage.--The consequence was, that Ebn Saad began\r\nto think himself as great a prophet as his master, and took upon himself\r\nto imitate the Koran according to his fancy; but the imitator got\r\nhimself into trouble, and only escaped with life by falling on his\r\nknees, and solemnly swearing he would never again imitate the Koran, for\r\nwhich he was sensible God had never created him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCICERO'S PUNS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I should,\" says Menage, \"have received great pleasure to have conversed\r\nwith Cicero, had I lived in his time. He must have been a man very\r\nagreeable in conversation, since even Cæsar carefully collected his\r\n_bons mots_. Cicero has boasted of the great actions he has done for his\r\ncountry, because there is no vanity in exulting in the performance of\r\nour duties; but he has not boasted that he was the most eloquent orator\r\nof his age, though he certainly was; because nothing is more disgusting\r\nthan to exult in our intellectual powers.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever were the _bons mots_ of Cicero, of which few have come down to\r\nus, it is certain that Cicero was an inveterate punster; and he seems to\r\nhave been more ready with them than with repartees. He said to a\r\nsenator, who was the son of a tailor, \"_Rem acu tetigisti_.\" You have\r\ntouched it sharply; _acu_ means sharpness as well as the point of a\r\nneedle. To the son of a cook, \"_ego quoque tibi jure favebo_.\" The\r\nancients pronounced _coce_ and _quoque_ like _co-ke_, which alludes to\r\nthe Latin _cocus_, cook, besides the ambiguity of _jure_, which applies\r\nto _broth_ or _law--jus_. A Sicilian suspected of being a Jew, attempted\r\nto get the cause of Verres into his own hands; Cicero, who knew that he\r\nwas a creature of the great culprit, opposed him, observing \"What has a\r\nJew to do with swine's flesh?\" The Romans called a boar pig Verres. I\r\nregret to afford a respectable authority for forensic puns; however, to\r\nhave degraded his adversaries by such petty personalities, only proves\r\nthat Cicero's taste was not exquisite.\r\n\r\nThere is something very original in Montaigne's censure of Cicero.\r\nCotton's translation is admirable.\r\n\r\n\"Boldly to confess the truth, his way of writing, and that of all other\r\nlong-winded authors, appears to me very tedious; for his preface,\r\ndefinitions, divisions, and etymologies, take up the greatest part of\r\nhis work; whatever there is of life and marrow, is smothered and lost in\r\nthe preparation. When I have spent an hour in reading him, which is a\r\ngreat deal for me, and recollect what I have thence extracted of juice\r\nand substance, for the most part I find nothing but wind: for he is not\r\nyet come to the arguments that serve to his purpose, and the reasons\r\nthat should properly help to loose the knot I would untie. For me, who\r\nonly desired to become more wise, not more learned or eloquent, these\r\nlogical or Aristotelian disquisitions of poets are of no use. I look for\r\ngood and solid reasons at the first dash. I am for discourses that give\r\nthe first charge into the heart of the doubt; his languish about the\r\nsubject, and delay our expectation. Those are proper for the schools,\r\nfor the bar, and for the pulpit, where we have leisure to nod, and may\r\nawake a quarter of an hour after, time enough to find again the thread\r\nof the discourse. It is necessary to speak after this manner to judges,\r\nwhom a man has a design, right or wrong, to incline to favour his cause;\r\nto children and common people, to whom a man must say all he can. I\r\nwould not have an author make it his business to render me attentive; or\r\nthat he should cry out fifty times _O yes_! as the clerks and heralds\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\"As to Cicero, I am of the common opinion that, learning excepted, he\r\nhad no great natural parts. He was a good citizen, of an affable\r\nnature, as all fat heavy men--(_gras et gausseurs_ are the words in the\r\noriginal, meaning perhaps broad jokers, for Cicero was not fat)--such as\r\nhe was, usually are; but given to ease, and had a mighty share of vanity\r\nand ambition. Neither do I know how to excuse him for thinking his\r\npoetry fit to be published. 'Tis no great imperfection to write ill\r\nverses; but it is an imperfection not to be able to judge how unworthy\r\nbad verses were of the glory of his name. For what concerns his\r\neloquence, that is totally out of comparison, and I believe will never\r\nbe equalled.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA preface, being the entrance to a book, should invite by its beauty. An\r\nelegant porch announces the splendour of the interior. I have observed\r\nthat ordinary readers skip over these little elaborate compositions. The\r\nladies consider them as so many pages lost, which might better be\r\nemployed in the addition of a picturesque scene, or a tender letter to\r\ntheir novels. For my part I always gather amusement from a preface, be\r\nit awkwardly or skilfully written; for dulness, or impertinence, may\r\nraise a laugh for a page or two. A preface is frequently a superior\r\ncomposition to the work itself: for, long before the days of Johnson, it\r\nhad been a custom for many authors to solicit for this department of\r\ntheir work the ornamental contribution of a man of genius. Cicero tells\r\nhis friend Atticus, that he had a volume of prefaces or introductions\r\nalways ready by him to be used as circumstances required. These must\r\nhave been like our periodical essays. A good preface is as essential to\r\nput the reader into good humour, as a good prologue is to a play, or a\r\nfine symphony to an opera, containing something analogous to the work\r\nitself; so that we may feel its want as a desire not elsewhere to be\r\ngratified. The Italians call the preface _La salsa del libra_, the sauce\r\nof the book, and if well seasoned it creates an appetite in the reader\r\nto devour the book itself. A preface badly composed prejudices the\r\nreader against the work. Authors are not equally fortunate in these\r\nlittle introductions; some can compose volumes more skilfully than\r\nprefaces, and others can finish a preface who could never be capable of\r\nfinishing a book.\r\n\r\nOn a very elegant preface prefixed to an ill-written book, it was\r\nobserved that they ought never to have _come together_; but a sarcastic\r\nwit remarked that he considered such _marriages_ were allowable, for\r\nthey were _not of kin_.\r\n\r\nIn prefaces an affected haughtiness or an affected humility are alike\r\ndespicable. There is a deficient dignity in Robertson's; but the\r\nhaughtiness is now to our purpose. This is called by the French, \"_la\r\nmorgue littéraire_,\" the surly pomposity of literature. It is sometimes\r\nused by writers who have succeeded in their first work, while the\r\nfailure of their subsequent productions appears to have given them a\r\nliterary hypochondriasm. Dr. Armstrong, after his classical poem, never\r\nshook hands cordially with the public for not relishing his barren\r\nlabours. In the _preface_ to his lively \"Sketches\" he tells us, \"he\r\ncould give them much bolder strokes as well as more delicate touches,\r\nbut that he _dreads the danger of writing too well_, and feels the value\r\nof his own labour too sensibly to bestow it upon the _mobility_.\" This\r\nis pure milk compared to the gall in the _preface_ to his poems. There\r\nhe tells us, \"that at last he has taken the _trouble to collect them_!\r\nWhat he has destroyed would, probably enough, have been better received\r\nby the _great majority of readers_. But he has always _most heartily\r\ndespised their opinion_.\" These prefaces remind one of the _prologi\r\ngaleati_, prefaces with a helmet! as St. Jerome entitles the one to his\r\nVersion of the Scriptures. These _armed prefaces_ were formerly very\r\ncommon in the age of literary controversy; for half the business of an\r\nauthor consisted then, either in replying, or anticipating a reply, to\r\nthe attacks of his opponent.\r\n\r\nPrefaces ought to be dated; as these become, after a series of editions,\r\nleading and useful circumstances in literary history.\r\n\r\nFuller with quaint humour observes on INDEXES--\"An INDEX is a necessary\r\nimplement, and no impediment of a book, except in the same sense wherein\r\nthe carriages of an army are termed _Impedimenta_. Without this, a large\r\nauthor is but a labyrinth without a clue to direct the reader therein. I\r\nconfess there is a lazy kind of learning which is _only Indical_; when\r\nscholars (like adders which only bite the horse's heels) nibble but at\r\nthe tables, which are _calces librorum_, neglecting the body of the\r\nbook. But though the idle deserve no crutches (let not a staff be used\r\nby them, but on them), pity it is the weary should be denied the benefit\r\nthereof, and industrious scholars prohibited the accommodation of an\r\nindex, most used by those who most pretend to contemn it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY PRINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is some probability that this art originated in China, where it\r\nwas practised long before it was known in Europe. Some European\r\ntraveller might have imported the hint.[30] That the Romans did not\r\npractise the art of printing cannot but excite our astonishment, since\r\nthey actually used it, unconscious of their rich possession. I have seen\r\nRoman stereotypes, or immoveable printing types, with which they stamped\r\ntheir pottery.[31] How in daily practising the art, though confined to\r\nthis object, it did not occur to so ingenious a people to print their\r\nliterary works, is not easily to be accounted for. Did the wise and\r\ngrave senate dread those inconveniences which attend its indiscriminate\r\nuse? Or perhaps they did not care to deprive so large a body of scribes\r\nof their business. Not a hint of the art itself appears in their\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\nWhen first the art of printing was discovered, they only made use of one\r\nside of a leaf; they had not yet found out the expedient of impressing\r\nthe other. Afterwards they thought of pasting the blank sides, which\r\nmade them appear like one leaf. Their blocks were made of soft woods,\r\nand their letters were carved; but frequently breaking, the expense and\r\ntrouble of carving and gluing new letters suggested our moveable types\r\nwhich, have produced an almost miraculous celerity in this art. The\r\nmodern stereotype, consisting of entire pages in solid blocks of metal,\r\nand, not being liable to break like the soft wood at first used, has\r\nbeen profitably employed for works which require to be frequently\r\nreprinted. Printing in carved blocks of wood must have greatly retarded\r\nthe progress of universal knowledge: for one set of types could only\r\nhave produced one work, whereas it now serves for hundreds.\r\n\r\nWhen their editions were intended to be curious, they omitted to print\r\nthe initial letter of a chapter: they left that blank space to be\r\npainted or illuminated, to the fancy of the purchaser. Several ancient\r\nvolumes of these early times have been found where these letters are\r\nwanting, as they neglected to have them painted.\r\n\r\nThe initial carved letter, which is generally a fine wood-cut, among our\r\nprinted books, is evidently a remains or imitation of these\r\nornaments.[32] Among the very earliest books printed, which were\r\nreligious, the Poor Man's Bible has wooden cuts in a coarse style,\r\nwithout the least shadowing or crossing of strokes, and these they\r\ninelegantly daubed over with broad colours, which they termed\r\nilluminating, and sold at a cheap rate to those who could not afford to\r\npurchase costly missals elegantly written and painted on vellum.\r\nSpecimens of these rude efforts of illuminated prints may be seen in\r\nStrutt's Dictionary of Engravers. The Bodleian library possesses the\r\noriginals.[33]\r\n\r\nIn the productions of early printing may be distinguished the various\r\nsplendid editions of _Primers_, or _Prayer-books_. These were\r\nembellished with cuts finished in a most elegant taste: many of them\r\nwere grotesque or obscene. In one of them an angel is represented\r\ncrowning the Virgin Mary, and God the Father himself assisting at the\r\nceremony. Sometimes St. Michael is overcoming Satan; and sometimes St.\r\nAnthony is attacked by various devils of most clumsy forms--not of the\r\ngrotesque and limber family of Callot!\r\n\r\nPrinting was gradually practised throughout Europe from the year 1440 to\r\n1500. Caxton and his successor Wynkyn de Worde were our own earliest\r\nprinters. Caxton was a wealthy merchant, who, in 1464, being sent by\r\nEdward IV. to negotiate a commercial treaty with the Duke of Burgundy,\r\nreturned to his country with this invaluable art. Notwithstanding his\r\nmercantile habits, he possessed a literary taste, and his first work was\r\na translation from a French historical miscellany.[34]\r\n\r\nThe tradition of the Devil and Dr. Faustus was said to have been derived\r\nfrom the odd circumstance in which the Bibles of the first printer,\r\nFust, appeared to the world; but if Dr. Faustus and Faustus the printer\r\nare two different persons, the tradition becomes suspicious, though, in\r\nsome respects, it has a foundation in truth. When Fust had discovered\r\nthis new art, and printed off a considerable number of copies of the\r\nBible to imitate those which were commonly sold as MSS., he undertook\r\nthe sale of them at Paris. It was his interest to conceal this\r\ndiscovery, and to pass off his printed copies for MSS. But, enabled to\r\nsell his Bibles at sixty crowns, while the other scribes demanded five\r\nhundred, this raised universal astonishment; and still more when he\r\nproduced copies as fast as they were wanted, and even lowered his price.\r\nThe uniformity of the copies increased the wonder. Informations were\r\ngiven in to the magistrates against him as a magician; and in searching\r\nhis lodgings a great number of copies were found. The red ink, and\r\nFust's red ink is peculiarly brilliant, which embellished his copies,\r\nwas said to be his blood; and it was solemnly adjudged that he was in\r\nleague with the Infernals. Fust at length was obliged, to save himself\r\nfrom a bonfire, to reveal his art to the Parliament of Paris, who\r\ndischarged him from all prosecution in consideration of the wonderful\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nWhen the art of printing was established, it became the glory of the\r\nlearned to be correctors of the press to eminent printers. Physicians,\r\nlawyers, and bishops themselves occupied this department. The printers\r\nthen added frequently to their names those of the correctors of the\r\npress; and editions were then valued according to the abilities of the\r\ncorrector.\r\n\r\nThe _prices_ of books in these times were considered as an object worthy\r\nof the animadversions of the highest powers. This anxiety in favour of\r\nthe studious appears from a privilege of Pope Leo X. to Aldus Manutius\r\nfor printing Varro, dated 1553, signed Cardinal Bembo. Aldus is exhorted\r\nto put a moderate price on the work, lest the Pope should withdraw his\r\nprivilege, and accord it to others.\r\n\r\nRobert Stephens, one of the early printers, surpassed in correctness\r\nthose who exercised the same profession.[35]\r\n\r\nTo render his editions immaculate, he hung up the proofs in public\r\nplaces, and generously recompensed those who were so fortunate as to\r\ndetect any errata.\r\n\r\nPlantin, though a learned man, is more famous as a printer. His\r\nprinting-office was one of the wonders of Europe. This grand building\r\nwas the chief ornament of the city of Antwerp. Magnificent in its\r\nstructure, it presented to the spectator a countless number of presses,\r\ncharacters of all figures and all sizes, matrixes to cast letters, and\r\nall other printing materials; which Baillet assures us amounted to\r\nimmense sums.[36]\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the three Manutii were more solicitous of correctness and\r\nillustrations than of the beauty of their printing. They were ambitious\r\nof the character of the scholar, not of the printer.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that our publishers are not literary men,\r\nable to form their own critical decisions. Among the learned printers\r\nformerly, a book was valued because it came from the presses of an Aldus\r\nor a Stephens; and even in our own time the names of Bowyer and Dodsley\r\nsanctioned a work. Pelisson, in his history of the French Academy,\r\nmentions that Camusat was selected as their bookseller, from his\r\nreputation for publishing only valuable works. \"He was a man of some\r\nliterature and good sense, and rarely printed an indifferent work; and\r\nwhen we were young I recollect that we always made it a rule to purchase\r\nhis publications. His name was a test of the goodness of the work.\" A\r\npublisher of this character would be of the greatest utility to the\r\nliterary world: at home he would induce a number of ingenious men to\r\nbecome authors, for it would be honourable to be inscribed in his\r\ncatalogue; and it would be a direction for the continental reader.\r\n\r\nSo valuable a union of learning and printing did not, unfortunately,\r\nlast. The printers of the seventeenth century became less charmed with\r\nglory than with gain. Their correctors and their letters evinced as\r\nlittle delicacy of choice.\r\n\r\nThe invention of what is now called the _Italic_ letter in printing was\r\nmade by Aldus Manutius, to whom learning owes much. He observed the\r\nmany inconveniences resulting from the vast number of _abbreviations_,\r\nwhich were then so frequent among the printers, that a book was\r\ndifficult to understand; a treatise was actually written on the art of\r\nreading a printed book, and this addressed to the learned! He contrived\r\nan expedient, by which these abbreviations might be entirely got rid of,\r\nand yet books suffer little increase in bulk. This he effected by\r\nintroducing what is now called the _Italic_ letter, though it formerly\r\nwas distinguished by the name of the inventor, and called the _Aldine_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: China is the stronghold where antiquarian controversy\r\nrests. Beaten in affixing the origin of any art elsewhere, the\r\ncontroversialist enshrines himself within the Great Wall, and is allowed\r\nto repose in peace. Opponents, like Arabs, give up the chase when these\r\ngates close, though possibly with as little reason as the children of\r\nthe desert evince when they quietly succumb to any slight defence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: They are small square blocks of metal, with the name in\r\nraised letters within a border, precisely similar to those used by the\r\nmodern printer. Sometimes the stamp was round, or in the shape of a foot\r\nor hand, with the potter's name in the centre. They were in constant use\r\nfor impressing the clay-works which supplied the wants of a Roman\r\nhousehold. The list of potters' marks found upon fragments discovered in\r\nLondon alone amounts to several hundreds.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Another reason for the omission of a great initial is\r\ngiven. There was difficulty in obtaining such enriched letters by\r\nengraving as were used in manuscripts; and there was at this time a\r\nlarge number of professional scribes, whose interests were in some\r\ndegree considered by the printer. Hence we find in early books a large\r\nspace left to be filled in by the hand of the scribe with the proper\r\nletter indicated by a small type letter placed in the midst. The famous\r\n_Psalter_ printed by Faust and Scheffer, at Mentz, in 1497, is the first\r\nbook having large initial letters printed in red and blue inks, in\r\nimitation of the handwork of the old caligraphers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: The British Museum now possesses a remarkably fine series\r\nof these early works. They originated in the large sheet woodcuts, or\r\n\"broadsides,\" representing saints, or scenes from saintly legends, used\r\nby the clergy as presents to the peasantry or pilgrims to certain\r\nshrines--a custom retained upon the Continent to the present time; such\r\ncuts exhibiting little advance in art since the days of their origin,\r\nbeing almost as rude, and daubed in a similar way with coarse colour.\r\nOne ancient cut of this kind in the British Museum, representing the\r\nSaviour brought before Pilate, resembles in style the pen-drawings in\r\nmanuscripts of the fourteenth century. Another exhibits the seven stages\r\nof human life, with the wheel of fortune in the centre. Another is an\r\nemblematic representation of the Tower of Sapience, each stone formed of\r\nsome mental qualification. When books were formed, a large series of\r\nsuch cuts included pictures and type in each page, and in one piece. The\r\nso-called Poor Man's Bible (an evidently erroneous term for it, the\r\ninvention of a bibliographer of the last century) was one of these, and\r\nconsists of a series of pictures from Scripture history, with brief\r\nexplanations. It was most probably preceded by the block books known as\r\nthe _Apocalypse of St. John_, the _Cantico Canticorum_, and the _Ars\r\nMemorandi_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: This was Raoul le Fevre's _Recueil des Histoires de\r\nTroye_, a fanciful compilation of adventures, in which the heroes of\r\nantiquity perform the parts of the _preux chevaliers_ of the middle\r\nages. It was \"ended in the Holy City of Colen,\" in September, 1471. The\r\nfirst book printed by him in England was _The Game and Playe of the\r\nChesse_, in March, 1474. It is a fanciful moralization of the game,\r\nabounding with quaint old legends and stories.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Robert Stephens was the most celebrated of a family\r\nrenowned through several generations in the history of printing. The\r\nfirst of the dynasty, Henry Estienne, who, in the spirit of the age,\r\nlatinized his name, was born in Paris, in 1470, and commenced printing\r\nthere at the beginning of the sixteenth century. His three\r\nsons--Francis, Robert, and Charles--were all renowned printers and\r\nscholars; Robert the most celebrated for the correctness and beauty of\r\nhis work. His Latin Bible of 1532 made for him a great reputation; and\r\nhe was appointed printer to Francis I. A new edition of his Bible, in\r\n1545, brought him into trouble with the formidable doctors of the\r\nSorbonne, and he ultimately left Paris for Geneva, where he set up a\r\nprinting-office, which soon became famous. He died in 1559. He was the\r\nauthor of some learned works, and a printer whose labours in the \"noble\r\nart\" have never been excelled. He left two sons--Henry and Robert--also\r\nremarkable as learned printers; and they both had sons who followed the\r\nsame pursuits. There is not one of this large family without honourable\r\nrecognition for labour and knowledge, and in their wives and daughters\r\nthey found learned assistants. Chalmers says--\"They were at once the\r\nornament and reproach of the age in which they lived. They were all men\r\nof great learning, all extensive benefactors to literature, and all\r\npersecuted or unfortunate.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Plantin's office is still existing in Antwerp, and is one\r\nof the most interesting places in that interesting city. It is so\r\ncarefully preserved, that its quadrangle was assigned to the soldiery in\r\nthe last great revolution, to prevent any hostile incursion and damage.\r\nIt is a lonely building, in which the old office, with its presses and\r\nprinting material, still remains as when deserted by the last workman.\r\nThe sheets of the last books printed there are still lying on the\r\ntables; and in the presses and drawers are hundreds of the woodcuts and\r\ncopperplates used by Plantin for the books that made his office renowned\r\nthroughout Europe. In the quadrangle are busts of himself and his\r\nsuccessors, the Morels, and the scholars who were connected with them.\r\nPlantin's own room seems to want only his presence to perfect the scene.\r\nThe furniture and fittings, the quaint decoration, leads the imagination\r\ninsensibly back to the days of Charles V.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary _errata_, which happen in printing a work, others\r\nhave been purposely committed, that the _errata_ may contain what is not\r\npermitted to appear in the body of the work. Wherever the Inquisition\r\nhad any power, particularly at Rome, it was not allowed to employ the\r\nword _fatum_, or _fata_, in any book. An author, desirous of using the\r\nlatter word, adroitly invented this scheme; he had printed in his book\r\n_facta_, and, in the _errata_, he put, \"For _facta_, read _fata_.\"\r\n\r\nScarron has done the same thing on another occasion. He had composed\r\nsome verses, at the head of which he placed this dedication--_A\r\nGuillemette, Chienne de ma Soeur_; but having a quarrel with his sister,\r\nhe maliciously put into the _errata_, \"Instead of _Chienne de ma Soeur_,\r\nread _ma Chienne de Soeur_.\"\r\n\r\nLully, at the close of a bad prologue said, the word _fin du prologue_\r\nwas an _erratum_, it should have been _fi du prologue_!\r\n\r\nIn a book, there was printed, _le docte Morel_. A wag put into the\r\n_errata_, \"For _le docte Morel_, read _le Docteur Morel_.\" This _Morel_\r\nwas not the first _docteur_ not _docte_.\r\n\r\nWhen a fanatic published a mystical work full of unintelligible\r\nraptures, and which he entitled _Les Délices de l'Esprit_, it was\r\nproposed to print in his errata, \"For _Délices_ read _Délires_.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of an idle and imperfect book ended with the usual phrase of\r\n_cetera desiderantur_, one altered it, _Non desiderantur sed desunt_;\r\n\"The rest is _wanting_, but not _wanted_.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of a silly book, the author as usual printed the word\r\nFINIS.--A wit put this among the errata, with this pointed couplet:--\r\n\r\n    FINIS!--an error, or a lie, my friend!\r\n    In writing foolish books--there is _no End_!\r\n\r\nIn the year 1561 was printed a work, entitled \"the Anatomy of the Mass.\"\r\nIt is a thin octavo, of 172 pages, and it is accompanied by an _Errata_\r\nof 15 pages! The editor, a pious monk, informs us that a very serious\r\nreason induced him to undertake this task: for it is, says he, to\r\nforestal the _artifices of Satan_. He supposes that the Devil, to ruin\r\nthe fruit of this work, employed two very malicious frauds: the first\r\nbefore it was printed, by drenching the MS. in a kennel, and having\r\nreduced it to a most pitiable state, rendered several parts illegible:\r\nthe second, in obliging the printers to commit such numerous blunders,\r\nnever yet equalled in so small a work. To combat this double machination\r\nof Satan he was obliged carefully to re-peruse the work, and to form\r\nthis singular list of the blunders of printers under the influence of\r\nSatan. All this he relates in an advertisement prefixed to the _Errata_.\r\n\r\nA furious controversy raged between two famous scholars from a very\r\nlaughable but accidental _Erratum_, and threatened serious consequences\r\nto one of the parties. Flavigny wrote two letters, criticising rather\r\nfreely a polyglot Bible edited by Abraham Ecchellensis. As this learned\r\neditor had sometimes censured the labours of a friend of Flavigny, this\r\nlatter applied to him the third and fifth verses of the seventh chapter\r\nof St. Matthew, which he printed in Latin. Ver 3. _Quid vides festucam\r\nin_ OCULO _fratris tui, et trabem in_ OCULO _tuo non vides_? Ver. 5.\r\n_Ejice primùm trabem de_ OCULO _tuo, et tunc videbis ejicere festucam\r\nde_ OCULO _fratris tui_. Ecchellensis opens his reply by accusing\r\nFlavigny of an _enormous crime_ committed in this passage; attempting to\r\ncorrect the sacred text of the Evangelist, and daring to reject a word,\r\nwhile he supplied its place by another as _impious_ as _obscene_! This\r\ncrime, exaggerated with all the virulence of an angry declaimer, closes\r\nwith a dreadful accusation. Flavigny's morals are attacked, and his\r\nreputation overturned by a horrid imputation. Yet all this terrible\r\nreproach is only founded on an _Erratum_! The whole arose from the\r\nprinter having negligently suffered the _first letter_ of the word\r\n_Oculo_ to have dropped from the form, when he happened to touch a line\r\nwith his finger, which did not stand straight! He published another\r\nletter to do away the imputation of Ecchellensis; but thirty years\r\nafterwards his rage against the negligent printer was not extinguished;\r\nthe wits were always reminding him of it.\r\n\r\nOf all literary blunders none equalled that of the edition of the\r\nVulgate, by Sixtus V. His Holiness carefully superintended every sheet\r\nas it passed through the press; and, to the amazement of the world, the\r\nwork remained without a rival--it swarmed with errata! A multitude of\r\nscraps were printed to paste over the erroneous passages, in order to\r\ngive the true text. The book makes a whimsical appearance with these\r\npatches; and the heretics exulted in this demonstration of papal\r\ninfallibility! The copies were called in, and violent attempts made to\r\nsuppress it; a few still remain for the raptures of the biblical\r\ncollectors; not long ago the bible of Sixtus V. fetched above sixty\r\nguineas--not too much for a mere book of blunders! The world was highly\r\namused at the bull of the editorial Pope prefixed to the first volume,\r\nwhich excommunicates all printers who in reprinting the work should make\r\nany _alteration_ in the text!\r\n\r\nIn the version of the Epistles of St. Paul into the Ethiopic language,\r\nwhich proved to be full of errors, the editors allege a good-humoured\r\nreason--\"They who printed the work could not read, and we could not\r\nprint; they helped us, and we helped them, as the blind helps the\r\nblind.\"\r\n\r\nA printer's widow in Germany, while a new edition of the Bible was\r\nprinting at her house, one night took an opportunity of stealing into\r\nthe office, to alter that sentence of subjection to her husband,\r\npronounced upon Eve in Genesis, chap. 3, v. 16. She took out the two\r\nfirst letters of the word HERR, and substituted NA in their place, thus\r\naltering the sentence from \"and he shall be thy LORD\" (_Herr_), to \"and\r\nhe shall be thy FOOL\" (_Narr_). It is said her life paid for this\r\nintentional erratum; and that some secreted copies of this edition have\r\nbeen bought up at enormous prices.\r\n\r\nWe have an edition of the Bible, known by the name of _The Vinegar\r\nBible_; from the erratum in the title to the 20th chap. of St. Luke, in\r\nwhich \"Parable of the _Vineyard_,\" is printed, \"Parable of the\r\n_Vinegar_.\" It was printed in 1717, at the Clarendon press.\r\n\r\nWe have had another, where \"Thou shalt commit adultery\" was printed,\r\nomitting the negation; which occasioned the archbishop to lay one of the\r\nheaviest penalties on the Company of Stationers that was ever recorded\r\nin the annals of literary history.[37]\r\n\r\nHerbert Croft used to complain of the incorrectness of our English\r\nclassics, as reprinted by the booksellers. It is evident some stupid\r\nprinter often changes a whole text intentionally. The fine description\r\nby Akenside of the Pantheon, \"SEVERELY great,\" not being understood by\r\nthe blockhead, was printed _serenely great_. Swift's own edition of \"The\r\nCity Shower,\" has \"old ACHES throb.\" _Aches_ is two syllables, but\r\nmodern printers, who had lost the right pronunciation, have _aches_ as\r\none syllable; and then, to complete the metre, have foisted in \"aches\r\n_will_ throb.\" Thus what the poet and the linguist wish to preserve is\r\naltered, and finally lost.[38]\r\n\r\nIt appears by a calculation made by the printer of Steevens's edition of\r\nShakspeare, that every octavo page of that work, text and notes,\r\ncontains 2680 distinct pieces of metal; which in a sheet amount to\r\n42,880--the misplacing of any one of which would inevitably cause a\r\nblunder! With this curious fact before us, the accurate state of our\r\nprinting, in general, is to be admired, and errata ought more freely to\r\nbe pardoned than the fastidious minuteness of the insect eye of certain\r\ncritics has allowed.\r\n\r\nWhether such a miracle as an immaculate edition of a classical author\r\ndoes exist, I have never learnt; but an attempt has been made to obtain\r\nthis glorious singularity--and was as nearly realised as is perhaps\r\npossible in the magnificent edition of _Os Lusiadas_ of Camoens, by Dom\r\nJoze Souza, in 1817. This amateur spared no prodigality of cost and\r\nlabour, and flattered himself, that by the assistance of Didot, not a\r\nsingle typographical error should be found in that splendid volume. But\r\nan error was afterwards discovered in some of the copies, occasioned by\r\none of the letters in the word _Lusitano_ having got misplaced during\r\nthe working of one of the sheets. It must be confessed that this was an\r\n_accident_ or _misfortune_--rather than an _Erratum!_\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable complaints on ERRATA is that of Edw. Leigh,\r\nappended to his curious treatise on \"Religion and Learning.\" It consists\r\nof two folio pages, in a very minute character, and exhibits an\r\nincalculable number of printers' blunders. \"We have not,\" he says,\r\n\"Plantin nor Stephens amongst us; and it is no easy task to specify the\r\nchiefest errata; false interpunctions there are too many; here a letter\r\nwanting, there a letter too much; a syllable too much, one letter for\r\nanother; words parted where they should be joined; words joined which\r\nshould be severed; words misplaced; chronological mistakes,\" &c. This\r\nunfortunate folio was printed in 1656. Are we to infer, by such frequent\r\ncomplaints of the authors of that day, that either they did not receive\r\nproofs from the printers, or that the printers never attended to the\r\ncorrected proofs? Each single erratum seems to have been felt as a stab\r\nto the literary feelings of the poor author!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: It abounded with other errors, and was so rigidly\r\nsuppressed, that a well-known collector was thirty years endeavouring\r\nineffectually to obtain a copy. One has recently been added to the\r\nBritish Museum collection.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: A good example occurs in _Hudibras_ (Part iii. canto 2,\r\nline 407), where persons are mentioned who\r\n\r\n    \"Can by their pangs and _aches_ find\r\n    All turns and changes of the wind.\"\r\n\r\nThe rhythm here demands the dissyllable _a-ches_, as used by the older\r\nwriters, Shakspeare particularly, who, in his _Tempest_, makes Prospero\r\nthreaten Caliban--\r\n\r\n    \"If thou neglect'st, or dost unwillingly\r\n    What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps;\r\n    Fill all thy bones with _aches_; make thee roar\r\n    That beasts shall tremble at thy din.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Kemble was aware of the necessity of using this word in this\r\ninstance as a dissyllable, but it was so unusual to his audiences that\r\nit excited ridicule; and during the O.P. row, a medal was struck,\r\nrepresenting him as manager, enduring the din of cat-calls, trumpets,\r\nand rattles, and exclaiming, \"Oh! my head _aitches_!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors have too frequently received ill treatment even from those to\r\nwhom they dedicated their works.\r\n\r\nSome who felt hurt at the shameless treatment of such mock Mæcenases\r\nhave observed that no writer should dedicate his works but to his\r\nFRIENDS, as was practised by the ancients, who usually addressed those\r\nwho had solicited their labours, or animated their progress. Theodosius\r\nGaza had no other recompense for having inscribed to Sixtus IV. his\r\ntranslation of the book of Aristotle on the Nature of Animals, than the\r\nprice of the binding, which this charitable father of the church\r\nmunificently bestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nTheocritus fills his Idylliums with loud complaints of the neglect of\r\nhis patrons; and Tasso was as little successful in his dedications.\r\n\r\nAriosto, in presenting his Orlando Furioso to the Cardinal d'Este, was\r\ngratified with the bitter sarcasm of--\"_Dove diavolo avete pigliato\r\ntante coglionerie?_\" Where the devil have you found all this nonsense?\r\n\r\nWhen the French historian Dupleix, whose pen was indeed fertile,\r\npresented his book to the Duke d'Epernon, this Mæcenas, turning to the\r\nPope's Nuncio, who was present, very coarsely exclaimed--\"Cadedids! ce\r\nmonsieur a un flux enragé, il chie un livre toutes les lunes!\"\r\n\r\nThomson, the ardent author of the Seasons, having extravagantly praised\r\na person of rank, who afterwards appeared to be undeserving of\r\neulogiums, properly employed his pen in a solemn recantation of his\r\nerror. A very different conduct from that of Dupleix, who always spoke\r\nhighly of Queen Margaret of France for a little place he held in her\r\nhousehold: but after her death, when the place became extinct, spoke of\r\nher with all the freedom of satire. Such is too often the character of\r\nsome of the literati, who only dare to reveal the truth, when they have\r\nno interest to conceal it.\r\n\r\nPoor Mickle, to whom we are indebted for so beautiful a version of\r\nCamoens' Lusiad, having dedicated this work, the continued labour of\r\nfive years, to the Duke of Buccleugh, had the mortification to find, by\r\nthe discovery of a friend, that he had kept it in his possession three\r\nweeks before he could collect sufficient intellectual desire to cut open\r\nthe pages! The neglect of this nobleman reduced the poet to a state of\r\ndespondency. This patron was a political economist, the pupil of Adam\r\nSmith! It is pleasing to add, in contrast with this frigid Scotch\r\npatron, that when Mickle went to Lisbon, where his translation had long\r\npreceded his visit, he found the Prince of Portugal waiting on the quay\r\nto be the first to receive the translator of his great national poem;\r\nand during a residence of six months, Mickle was warmly regarded by\r\nevery Portuguese nobleman.\r\n\r\n\"Every man believes,\" writes Dr. Johnson to Baretti, \"that mistresses\r\nare unfaithful, and patrons are capricious. But he excepts his own\r\nmistress, and his own patron.\"\r\n\r\nA patron is sometimes oddly obtained. Benserade attached himself to\r\nCardinal Mazarin; but his friendship produced nothing but civility. The\r\npoet every day indulged his easy and charming vein of amatory and\r\npanegyrical poetry, while all the world read and admired his verses.\r\nOne evening the cardinal, in conversation with the king, described his\r\nmode of life when at the papal court. He loved the sciences; but his\r\nchief occupation was the belles lettres, composing little pieces of\r\npoetry; he said that he was then in the court of Rome what Benserade was\r\nnow in that of France. Some hours afterwards, the friends of the poet\r\nrelated to him the conversation of the cardinal. He quitted them\r\nabruptly, and ran to the apartment of his eminence, knocking with all\r\nhis force, that he might be certain of being heard. The cardinal had\r\njust gone to bed; but he incessantly clamoured, demanding entrance; they\r\nwere compelled to open the door. He ran to his eminence, fell upon his\r\nknees, almost pulled off the sheets of the bed in rapture, imploring a\r\nthousand pardons for thus disturbing him; but such was his joy in what\r\nhe had just heard, which he repeated, that he could not refrain from\r\nimmediately giving vent to his gratitude and his pride, to have been\r\ncompared with his eminence for his poetical talents! Had the door not\r\nbeen immediately opened, he should have expired; he was not rich, it was\r\ntrue, but he should now die contented! The cardinal was pleased with his\r\n_ardour_, and probably never suspected his _flattery_; and the next week\r\nour new actor was pensioned.\r\n\r\nOn Cardinal Richelieu, another of his patrons, he gratefully made this\r\nepitaph:--\r\n\r\n    Cy gist, ouy gist, par la mort bleu,\r\n    Le Cardinal de Richelieu,\r\n    Et ce qui cause mon ennuy\r\n    Ma PENSION avec lui.\r\n\r\n    Here lies, egad, 'tis very true,\r\n    The illustrious Cardinal Richelieu:\r\n    My grief is genuine--void of whim!\r\n    Alas! my _pension_ lies with him!\r\n\r\nLe Brun, the great French artist, painted himself holding in his hand\r\nthe portrait of his earliest patron. In this accompaniment the Artist\r\nmay be said to have portrayed the features of his soul. If genius has\r\ntoo often complained of its patrons, has it not also often over-valued\r\ntheir protection?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETS, PHILOSOPHERS, AND ARTISTS, MADE BY ACCIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccident has frequently occasioned the most eminent geniuses to display\r\ntheir powers. \"It was at Rome,\" says Gibbon, \"on the 15th of October,\r\n1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the\r\nbare-footed friars were singing vespers in the Temple of Jupiter, that\r\nthe idea of writing the Decline and Fall of the City first started to my\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\nFather Malebranche having completed his studies in philosophy and\r\ntheology without any other intention than devoting himself to some\r\nreligious order, little expected the celebrity his works acquired for\r\nhim. Loitering in an idle hour in the shop of a bookseller, and turning\r\nover a parcel of books, _L'Homme de Descartes_ fell into his hands.\r\nHaving dipt into parts, he read with such delight that the palpitations\r\nof his heart compelled him to lay the volume down. It was this\r\ncircumstance that produced those profound contemplations which made him\r\nthe Plato of his age.\r\n\r\nCowley became a poet by accident. In his mother's apartment he found,\r\nwhen very young, Spenser's Fairy Queen; and, by a continual study of\r\npoetry, he became so enchanted by the Muse, that he grew irrecoverably a\r\npoet.\r\n\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds had the first fondness for his art excited by the\r\nperusal of Richardson's Treatise.\r\n\r\nVaucanson displayed an uncommon genius for mechanics. His taste was\r\nfirst determined by an accident: when young, he frequently attended his\r\nmother to the residence of her confessor; and while she wept with\r\nrepentance, he wept with weariness! In this state of disagreeable\r\nvacation, says Helvetius, he was struck with the uniform motion of the\r\npendulum of the clock in the hall. His curiosity was roused; he\r\napproached the clock-case, and studied its mechanism; what he could not\r\ndiscover he guessed at. He then projected a similar machine; and\r\ngradually his genius produced a clock. Encouraged by this first success,\r\nhe proceeded in his various attempts; and the genius, which thus could\r\nform a clock, in time formed a fluting automaton.\r\n\r\nAccident determined the taste of Molière for the stage. His grandfather\r\nloved the theatre, and frequently carried him there. The young man lived\r\nin dissipation; the father observing it asked in anger, if his son was\r\nto be made an actor. \"Would to God,\" replied the grandfather, \"he were\r\nas good an actor as Monrose.\" The words struck young Molière, he took a\r\ndisgust to his tapestry trade, and it is to this circumstance France\r\nowes her greatest comic writer.\r\n\r\nCorneille loved; he made verses for his mistress, became a poet,\r\ncomposed _Mélite_ and afterwards his other celebrated works. The\r\ndiscreet Corneille had else remained a lawyer.\r\n\r\nWe owe the great discovery of Newton to a very trivial accident. When a\r\nstudent at Cambridge, he had retired during the time of the plague into\r\nthe country. As he was reading under an apple-tree, one of the fruit\r\nfell, and struck him a smart blow on the head. When he observed the\r\nsmallness of the apple, he was surprised at the force of the stroke.\r\nThis led him to consider the accelerating motion of falling bodies; from\r\nwhence he deduced the principle of gravity, and laid the foundation of\r\nhis philosophy.\r\n\r\nIgnatius Loyola was a Spanish gentleman, who was dangerously wounded at\r\nthe siege of Pampeluna. Having heated his imagination by reading the\r\nLives of the Saints during his illness, instead of a romance, he\r\nconceived a strong ambition to be the founder of a religious order;\r\nwhence originated the celebrated society of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nRousseau found his eccentric powers first awakened by the advertisement\r\nof the singular annual subject which the Academy of Dijon proposed for\r\nthat year, in which he wrote his celebrated declamation against the arts\r\nand sciences. A circumstance which decided his future literary efforts.\r\n\r\nLa Fontaine, at the age of twenty-two, had not taken any profession, or\r\ndevoted himself to any pursuit. Having accidentally heard some verses of\r\nMalherbe, he felt a sudden impulse, which directed his future life. He\r\nimmediately bought a Malherbe, and was so exquisitely delighted with\r\nthis poet that, after passing the nights in treasuring his verses in his\r\nmemory, he would run in the day-time to the woods, where, concealing\r\nhimself, he would recite his verses to the surrounding dryads.\r\n\r\nFlamsteed was an astronomer by accident. He was taken from school on\r\naccount of his illness, when Sacrobosco's book De Sphæra having been\r\nlent to him, he was so pleased with it that he immediately began a\r\ncourse of astronomic studies. Pennant's first propensity to natural\r\nhistory was the pleasure he received from an accidental perusal of\r\nWilloughby's work on birds. The same accident of finding, on the table\r\nof his professor, Reaumur's History of Insects, which he read more than\r\nhe attended to the lecture, and, having been refused the loan, gave such\r\nan instant turn to the mind of Bonnet, that he hastened to obtain a\r\ncopy; after many difficulties in procuring this costly work, its\r\npossession gave an unalterable direction to his future life. This\r\nnaturalist indeed lost the use of his sight by his devotion to the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin attributes the cast of his genius to a similar accident. \"I\r\nfound a work of De Foe's, entitled an 'Essay on Projects,' from which\r\nperhaps I derived impressions that have since influenced some of the\r\nprincipal events of my life.\"\r\n\r\nI shall add the incident which occasioned Roger Ascham to write his\r\n_Schoolmaster_, one of the few works among our elder writers, which we\r\nstill read with pleasure.\r\n\r\nAt a dinner given by Sir William Cecil, at his apartments at Windsor, a\r\nnumber of ingenious men were invited. Secretary Cecil communicated the\r\nnews of the morning, that several scholars at Eton had run away on\r\naccount of their master's severity, which he condemned as a great error\r\nin the education of youth. Sir William Petre maintained the contrary;\r\nsevere in his own temper, he pleaded warmly in defence of hard flogging.\r\nDr. Wootton, in softer tones, sided with the secretary. Sir John Mason,\r\nadopting no side, bantered both. Mr. Haddon seconded the hard-hearted\r\nSir William Petre, and adduced, as an evidence, that the best\r\nschoolmaster then in England was the hardest flogger. Then was it that\r\nRoger Ascham indignantly exclaimed, that if such a master had an able\r\nscholar it was owing to the boy's genius, and not the preceptor's rod.\r\nSecretary Cecil and others were pleased with Ascham's notions. Sir\r\nRichard Sackville was silent, but when Ascham after dinner went to the\r\nqueen to read one of the orations of Demosthenes, he took him aside, and\r\nfrankly told him that, though he had taken no part in the debate, he\r\nwould not have been absent from that conversation for a great deal; that\r\nhe knew to his cost the truth that Ascham had supported; for it was the\r\nperpetual flogging of such a schoolmaster that had given him an\r\nunconquerable aversion to study. And as he wished to remedy this defect\r\nin his own children, he earnestly exhorted Ascham to write his\r\nobservations on so interesting a topic. Such was the circumstance which\r\nproduced the admirable treatise of Roger Ascham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINEQUALITIES OF GENIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSingular inequalities are observable in the labours of genius; and\r\nparticularly in those which admit great enthusiasm, as in poetry, in\r\npainting, and in music. Faultless mediocrity industry can preserve in\r\none continued degree; but excellence, the daring and the happy, can only\r\nbe attained, by human faculties, by starts.\r\n\r\nOur poets who possess the greatest genius, with perhaps the least\r\nindustry, have at the same time the most splendid and the worst passages\r\nof poetry. Shakspeare and Dryden are at once the greatest and the least\r\nof our poets. With some, their great fault consists in having none.\r\n\r\nCarraccio sarcastically said of Tintoret--_Ho veduto il Tintoretto hora\r\neguale a Titiano, hora minore del Tintoretto_--\"I have seen Tintoret now\r\nequal to Titian, and now less than Tintoret.\"\r\n\r\nTrublet justly observes--The more there are _beauties_ and _great\r\nbeauties_ in a work, I am the less surprised to find _faults_ and _great\r\nfaults_. When you say of a work that it has many faults, that decides\r\nnothing: and I do not know by this, whether it is execrable or\r\nexcellent. You tell me of another, that it is without any faults: if\r\nyour account be just, it is certain the work cannot be excellent.\r\n\r\nIt was observed of one pleader, that he _knew_ more than he _said_; and\r\nof another, that he _said_ more than he _knew_.\r\n\r\nLucian happily describes the works of those who abound with the most\r\nluxuriant language, void of ideas. He calls their unmeaning verbosity\r\n\"anemone-words;\" for anemonies are flowers, which, however brilliant,\r\nonly please the eye, leaving no fragrance. Pratt, who was a writer of\r\nflowing but nugatory verses, was compared to the _daisy_; a flower\r\nindeed common enough, and without odour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL STYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many sciences, says Menage, on which we cannot indeed compose\r\nin a florid or elegant diction, such as geography, music, algebra,\r\ngeometry, &c. When Atticus requested Cicero to write on geography, the\r\nlatter excused himself, observing that its scenes were more adapted to\r\nplease the eye, than susceptible of the embellishments of style.\r\nHowever, in these kind of sciences, we may lend an ornament to their\r\ndryness by introducing occasionally some elegant allusion, or noticing\r\nsome incident suggested by the object.\r\n\r\nThus when we notice some inconsiderable place, for instance _Woodstock_,\r\nwe may recall attention to the residence of _Chaucer_, the parent of our\r\npoetry, or the romantic labyrinth of Rosamond; or as in \"an Autumn on\r\nthe Rhine,\" at Ingelheim, at the view of an old palace built by\r\nCharlemagne, the traveller adds, with \"a hundred columns brought from\r\nRome,\" and further it was \"the scene of the romantic amours of that\r\nmonarch's fair daughter, Ibertha, with Eginhard, his secretary:\" and\r\nviewing the Gothic ruins on the banks of the Rhine, he noticed them as\r\nhaving been the haunts of those illustrious _chevaliers voleurs_ whose\r\nchivalry consisted in pillaging the merchants and towns, till, in the\r\nthirteenth century, a citizen of Mayence persuaded the merchants of more\r\nthan a hundred towns to form a league against these little princes and\r\ncounts; the origin of the famous Rhenish league, which contributed so\r\nmuch to the commerce of Europe. This kind of erudition gives an interest\r\nto topography, by associating in our memory great events and personages\r\nwith the localities.\r\n\r\nThe same principle of composition may be carried with the happiest\r\neffect into some dry investigations, though the profound antiquary may\r\nnot approve of these sports of wit or fancy. Dr. Arbuthnot, in his\r\nTables of Ancient Coins, Weights, and Measures, a topic extremely barren\r\nof amusement, takes every opportunity of enlivening the dulness of his\r\ntask; even in these mathematical calculations he betrays his wit; and\r\nobserves that \"the polite Augustus, the emperor of the world, had\r\nneither any glass in his windows, nor a shirt to his back!\" Those uses\r\nof glass and linen indeed were not known in his time. Our physician is\r\nnot less curious and facetious in the account of the _fees_ which the\r\nRoman physicians received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose ecclesiastical histories entitled Legends are said to have\r\noriginated in the following circumstance.\r\n\r\nBefore colleges were established in the monasteries where the schools\r\nwere held, the professors in rhetoric frequently gave their pupils the\r\nlife of some saint for a trial of their talent at _amplification_. The\r\nstudents, at a loss to furnish out their pages, invented most of these\r\nwonderful adventures. Jortin observes, that the Christians used to\r\ncollect out of Ovid, Livy, and other pagan poets and historians, the\r\nmiracles and portents to be found there, and accommodated them to their\r\nown monks and saints. The good fathers of that age, whose simplicity was\r\nnot inferior to their devotion, were so delighted with these flowers of\r\nrhetoric, that they were induced to make a collection of these\r\nmiraculous compositions; not imagining that, at some distant period,\r\nthey would become matters of faith. Yet, when James de Voragine, Peter\r\nNadal, and Peter Ribadeneira, wrote the Lives of the Saints, they sought\r\nfor their materials in the libraries of the monasteries; and, awakening\r\nfrom the dust these manuscripts of amplification, imagined they made an\r\ninvaluable present to the world, by laying before them these voluminous\r\nabsurdities. The people received these pious fictions with all\r\nimaginable simplicity, and as these are adorned by a number of cuts, the\r\nmiracles were perfectly intelligible to their eyes. Tillemont, Fleury,\r\nBaillet, Launoi, and Bollandus, cleared away much of the rubbish; the\r\nenviable title of _Golden Legend_, by which James de Voragine called his\r\nwork, has been disputed; iron or lead might more aptly describe its\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWhen the world began to be more critical in their reading, the monks\r\ngave a graver turn to their narratives; and became penurious of their\r\nabsurdities. The faithful Catholic contends, that the line of tradition\r\nhas been preserved unbroken; notwithstanding that the originals were\r\nlost in the general wreck of literature from the barbarians, or came\r\ndown in a most imperfect state.\r\n\r\nBaronius has given the lives of many apocryphal saints; for instance, of\r\na Saint _Xinoris_, whom he calls a martyr of Antioch; but it appears\r\nthat Baronius having read in Chrysostom this _word_, which signifies a\r\n_couple_ or _pair_, he mistook it for the name of a saint, and contrived\r\nto give the most authentic biography of a saint who never existed![39]\r\nThe Catholics confess this sort of blunder is not uncommon, but then it\r\nis only fools who laugh! As a specimen of the happier inventions, one\r\nis given, embellished by the diction of Gibbon--\r\n\r\n\"Among the insipid legends of ecclesiastical history, I am tempted to\r\ndistinguish the memorable fable of the _Seven Sleepers_; whose imaginary\r\ndate corresponds with the reign of the younger Theodosius, and the\r\nconquest of Africa by the Vandals. When the Emperor Decius persecuted\r\nthe Christians, seven noble youths of Ephesus concealed themselves in a\r\nspacious cavern on the side of an adjacent mountain; where they were\r\ndoomed to perish by the tyrant, who gave orders that the entrance should\r\nbe firmly secured with a pile of stones. They immediately fell into a\r\ndeep slumber, which was miraculously prolonged, without injuring the\r\npowers of life, during a period of one hundred and eighty-seven years.\r\nAt the end of that time the slaves of Adolius, to whom the inheritance\r\nof the mountain had descended, removed the stones to supply materials\r\nfor some rustic edifice. The light of the sun darted into the cavern,\r\nand the Seven Sleepers were permitted to awake. After a slumber as they\r\nthought of a few hours, they were pressed by the calls of hunger; and\r\nresolved that Jamblichus, one of their number, should secretly return to\r\nthe city to purchase bread for the use of his companions. The youth, if\r\nwe may still employ that appellation, could no longer recognise the once\r\nfamiliar aspect of his native country; and his surprise was increased by\r\nthe appearance of a large cross, triumphantly erected over the principal\r\ngate of Ephesus. His singular dress and obsolete language confounded the\r\nbaker, to whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius as the current coin\r\nof the empire; and Jamblichus, on the suspicion of a secret treasure,\r\nwas dragged before the judge. Their mutual inquiries produced the\r\namazing discovery, that two centuries were almost elapsed since\r\nJamblichus and his friends had escaped from the rage of a Pagan tyrant.\r\nThe Bishop of Ephesus, the clergy, the magistrates, the people, and, it\r\nis said, the Emperor Theodosius himself, hastened to visit the cavern of\r\nthe Seven Sleepers; who bestowed their benediction, related their story,\r\nand at the same instant peaceably expired.\r\n\r\n\"This popular tale Mahomet learned when he drove his camels to the fairs\r\nof Syria; and he has introduced it, as a _divine revelation_, into the\r\nKoran.\"--The same story has been adopted and adorned by the nations,\r\nfrom Bengal to Africa, who profess the Mahometan religion.\r\n\r\nThe too curious reader may perhaps require other specimens of the more\r\nunlucky inventions of this \"Golden Legend;\" as characteristic of a\r\ncertain class of minds, the philosopher will contemn these grotesque\r\nfictions.\r\n\r\nThese monks imagined that holiness was often proportioned to a saint's\r\nfilthiness. St. Ignatius, say they, delighted to appear abroad with old\r\ndirty shoes; he never used a comb, but let his hair clot; and\r\nreligiously abstained from paring his nails. One saint attained to such\r\npiety as to have near three hundred patches on his breeches; which,\r\nafter his death, were hung up in public as an _incentive to imitation_.\r\nSt. Francis discovered, by certain experience, that the devils were\r\nfrightened away by such kinds of breeches, but were animated by clean\r\nclothing to tempt and seduce the wearers; and one of their heroes\r\ndeclares that the purest souls are in the dirtiest bodies. On this they\r\ntell a story which may not be very agreeable to fastidious delicacy.\r\nBrother Juniper was a gentleman perfectly pious, on this principle;\r\nindeed so great was his merit in this species of mortification, that a\r\nbrother declared he could always nose Brother Juniper when within a mile\r\nof the monastery, provided the wind was at the due point. Once, when the\r\nblessed Juniper, for he was no saint, was a guest, his host, proud of\r\nthe honour of entertaining so pious a personage, the intimate friend of\r\nSt. Francis, provided an excellent bed, and the finest sheets. Brother\r\nJuniper abhorred such luxury. And this too evidently appeared after his\r\nsudden departure in the morning, unknown to his kind host. The great\r\nJuniper did this, says his biographer, having told us what he did, not\r\nso much from his habitual inclinations, for which he was so justly\r\ncelebrated, as from his excessive piety, and as much as he could to\r\nmortify worldly pride, and to show how a true saint despised clean\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\nIn the life of St. Francis we find, among other grotesque miracles, that\r\nhe preached a sermon in a desert, but he soon collected an immense\r\naudience. The birds shrilly warbled to every sentence, and stretched out\r\ntheir necks, opened their beaks, and when he finished, dispersed with a\r\nholy rapture into four companies, to report his sermon to all the birds\r\nin the universe. A grasshopper remained a week with St. Francis during\r\nthe absence of the Virgin Mary, and pittered on his head. He grew so\r\ncompanionable with a nightingale, that when a nest of swallows began to\r\nbabble, he hushed them by desiring them not to tittle-tattle of their\r\nsister, the nightingale. Attacked by a wolf, with only the sign-manual\r\nof the cross, he held a long dialogue with his rabid assailant, till the\r\nwolf, meek as a lap-dog, stretched his paws in the hands of the saint,\r\nfollowed him through towns, and became half a Christian.\r\n\r\nThis same St. Francis had such a detestation of the good things of this\r\nworld, that he would never suffer his followers to touch money. A friar\r\nhaving placed in a window some money collected at the altar, he desired\r\nhim to take it in his mouth, and throw it on the dung of an ass! St.\r\nPhilip Nerius was such a _lover of poverty_, that he frequently prayed\r\nthat God would bring him to that state as to stand in need of a penny,\r\nand find nobody that would give him one!\r\n\r\nBut St. Macaire was so shocked at having _killed a louse_, that he\r\nendured seven years of penitence among the thorns and briars of a\r\nforest. A circumstance which seems to have reached Molière, who gives\r\nthis stroke to the character of his Tartuffe:--\r\n\r\n    Il s'impute à péché la moindre bagatelle;\r\n    Jusques-là qu'il se vint, l'autre jour, s'accuser\r\n    D'avoir pris une puce en faisant sa prière,\r\n    Et de l'avoir tuée avec trop de colère!\r\n\r\nI give a miraculous incident respecting two pious maidens. The night of\r\nthe Nativity of Christ, after the first mass, they both retired into a\r\nsolitary spot of their nunnery till the second mass was rung. One asked\r\nthe other, \"Why do you want two cushions, when I have only one?\" The\r\nother replied, \"I would place it between us, for the child Jesus; as the\r\nEvangelist says, where there are two or three persons assembled I am in\r\nthe midst of them.\"--This being done, they sat down, feeling a most\r\nlively pleasure at their fancy; and there they remained, from the\r\nNativity of Christ to that of John the Baptist; but this great interval\r\nof time passed with these saintly maidens as two hours would appear to\r\nothers. The abbess and nuns were alarmed at their absence, for no one\r\ncould give any account of them. In the eve of St. John, a cowherd,\r\npassing by them, beheld a beautiful child seated on a cushion between\r\nthis pair of runaway nuns. He hastened to the abbess with news of these\r\nstray sheep; she came and beheld this lovely child playfully seated\r\nbetween these nymphs; they, with blushing countenances, inquired if the\r\nsecond bell had already rung? Both parties were equally astonished to\r\nfind our young devotees had been there from the Nativity of Jesus to\r\nthat of St. John. The abbess inquired about the child who sat between\r\nthem; they solemnly declared they saw no child between them! and\r\npersisted in their story!\r\n\r\nSuch is one of these miracles of \"the Golden Legend,\" which a wicked wit\r\nmight comment on, and see nothing extraordinary in the whole story. The\r\ntwo nuns might be missing between the Nativities, and be found at last\r\nwith a child seated between them.--They might not choose to account\r\neither for their absence or their child--the only touch of miracle is\r\nthat, they asseverated, they _saw no child_--that I confess is a _little\r\n(child) too much_.\r\n\r\nThe lives of the saints by Alban Butler is the most sensible history of\r\nthese legends; Ribadeneira's lives of the saints exhibit more of the\r\nlegendary spirit, for wanting judgment and not faith, he is more\r\nvoluminous in his details. The antiquary may collect much curious\r\nphilosophical information, concerning the manners of the times, from\r\nthese singular narratives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: See the article on \"Literary Blunders,\" in this volume,\r\nfor the history of similar inventions, particularly the legend of St.\r\nUrsuala and the eleven thousand virgins, and the discovery of a certain\r\nSt. Viar]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORT-ROYAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery lover of letters has heard of this learned society, which\r\ncontributed so greatly to establish in France a taste for just\r\nreasoning, simplicity of style, and philosophical method. Their \"Logic,\r\nor the Art of Thinking,\" for its lucid, accurate, and diversified\r\nmatter, is still an admirable work; notwithstanding the writers had to\r\nemancipate themselves from the barbarism of the scholastic logic. It was\r\nthe conjoint labour of Arnauld and Nicolle. Europe has benefited by the\r\nlabours of these learned men: but not many have attended to the origin\r\nand dissolution of this literary society.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1637, Le Maitre, a celebrated advocate, resigned the bar,\r\nand the honour of being _Conseiller d'Etat_, which his uncommon merit\r\nhad obtained him, though then only twenty-eight years of age. His\r\nbrother, De Sericourt, who had followed the military profession, quitted\r\nit at the same time. Consecrating themselves to the service of religion,\r\nthey retired into a small house near _the Port-Royal_ of Paris, where\r\nthey were joined by their brothers De Sacy, De St. Elme, and De Valmont.\r\nArnauld, one of their most illustrious associates, was induced to enter\r\ninto the Jansenist controversy, and then it was that they encountered\r\nthe powerful persecution of the Jesuits. Constrained to remove from that\r\nspot, they fixed their residence at a few leagues from Paris, and called\r\nit _Port-Royal des Champs_.[40]\r\n\r\nThese illustrious recluses were joined by many distinguished persons who\r\ngave up their parks and houses to be appropriated to their schools; and\r\nthis community was called the _Society of Port-Royal_.\r\n\r\nHere were no rules, no vows, no constitution, and no cells formed.\r\nPrayer and study, and manual labour, were their only occupations. They\r\napplied themselves to the education of youth, and raised up little\r\nacademies in the neighbourhood, where the members of Port-Royal, the\r\nmost illustrious names of literary France, presided. None considered his\r\nbirth entitled him to any exemption from their public offices, relieving\r\nthe poor and attending on the sick, and employing themselves in their\r\nfarms and gardens; they were carpenters, ploughmen, gardeners, and\r\nvine-dressers, as if they had practised nothing else; they studied\r\nphysic, and surgery, and law; in truth, it seems that, from religious\r\nmotives, these learned men attempted to form a community of primitive\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Longueville, once a political chief, sacrificed her\r\nambition on the altar of Port-Royal, enlarged the monastic inclosure\r\nwith spacious gardens and orchards, built a noble house, and often\r\nretreated to its seclusion. The learned D'Andilly, the translator of\r\nJosephus, after his studious hours, resorted to the cultivation of\r\nfruit-trees; and the fruit of Port-Royal became celebrated for its size\r\nand flavour. Presents were sent to the Queen-Mother of France, Anne of\r\nAustria, and Cardinal Mazarin, who used to call it \"fruit béni.\" It\r\nappears that \"families of rank, affluence, and piety, who did not wish\r\nentirely to give up their avocations in the world, built themselves\r\ncountry-houses in the valley of Port-Royal, in order to enjoy the\r\nsociety of its religious and literary inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nIn the solitudes of Port-Royal _Racine_ received his education; and, on\r\nhis death-bed, desired to be buried in its cemetery, at the feet of his\r\nmaster Hamon. Arnauld, persecuted, and dying in a foreign country, still\r\ncast his lingering looks on this beloved retreat, and left the society\r\nhis heart, which was there inurned.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Longueville, a princess of the blood-royal, was, during\r\nher life, the powerful patroness of these solitary and religious men:\r\nbut her death, in 1679, was the fatal stroke which dispersed them for\r\never.\r\n\r\nThe envy and the fears of the Jesuits, and their rancour against\r\nArnauld, who with such ability had exposed their designs, occasioned the\r\ndestruction of the Port-Royal Society. _Exinanite, exinanite usque ad\r\nfundamentum in ea!_--\"Annihilate it, annihilate it, to its very\r\nfoundations!\" Such are the terms of the Jesuitic decree. The Jesuits had\r\nlong called the little schools of Port-Royal the hot-beds of heresy. The\r\nJesuits obtained by their intrigues an order from government to dissolve\r\nthat virtuous society. They razed the buildings, and ploughed up the\r\nvery foundation; they exhausted their hatred even on the stones, and\r\nprofaned even the sanctuary of the dead; the corpses were torn out of\r\ntheir graves, and dogs were suffered to contend for the rags of their\r\nshrouds. The memory of that asylum of innocence and learning was still\r\nkept alive by those who collected the engravings representing the place\r\nby Mademoiselle Hortemels. The police, under Jesuitic influence, at\r\nlength seized on the plates in the cabinet of the fair artist.--Caustic\r\nwas the retort courteous which Arnauld gave the Jesuits--\"I do not fear\r\nyour _pen_, but its _knife_.\"\r\n\r\nThese were men whom the love of retirement had united to cultivate\r\nliterature, in the midst of solitude, of peace, and of piety. Alike\r\noccupied on sacred, as on profane writers, their writings fixed the\r\nFrench language. The example of these solitaries shows how retirement is\r\nfavourable to penetrate into the sanctuary of the Muses.\r\n\r\nAn interesting anecdote is related of Arnauld on the occasion of the\r\ndissolution of this society. The dispersion of these great men, and\r\ntheir young scholars, was lamented by every one but their enemies. Many\r\npersons of the highest rank participated in their sorrows. The excellent\r\nArnauld, in that moment, was as closely pursued as if he had been a\r\nfelon.\r\n\r\nIt was then the Duchess of Longueville concealed Arnauld in an obscure\r\nlodging, who assumed the dress of a layman, wearing a sword and\r\nfull-bottomed wig. Arnauld was attacked by a fever, and in the course of\r\nconversation with his physician, he inquired after news. \"They talk of a\r\nnew book of the Port-Royal,\" replied the doctor, \"ascribed to Arnauld or\r\nto Sacy; but I do not believe it comes from Sacy; he does not write so\r\nwell.\"--\"How, sir!\" exclaimed the philosopher, forgetting his sword and\r\nwig; \"believe me, my nephew writes better than I do.\"--The physician\r\neyed his patient with amazement--he hastened to the duchess, and told\r\nher, \"The malady of the gentleman you sent me to is not very serious,\r\nprovided you do not suffer him to see any one, and insist on his holding\r\nhis tongue.\" The duchess, alarmed, immediately had Arnauld conveyed to\r\nher palace. She concealed him in an apartment, and persisted to attend\r\nhim herself.--\"Ask,\" she said, \"what you want of the servant, but it\r\nshall be myself who shall bring it to you.\"\r\n\r\nHow honourable is it to the female character, that, in many similar\r\noccurrences, their fortitude has proved to be equal to their\r\nsensibility! But the Duchess of Longueville contemplated in Arnauld a\r\nmodel of human fortitude which martyrs never excelled. His remarkable\r\nreply to Nicolle, when they were hunted from place to place, should\r\nnever be forgotten: Arnauld wished Nicolle to assist him in a new work,\r\nwhen the latter observed, \"We are now old, is it not time to rest?\"\r\n\"Rest!\" returned Arnauld, \"have we not all Eternity to rest in?\" The\r\nwhole of the Arnauld family were the most extraordinary instance of that\r\nhereditary character, which is continued through certain families: here\r\nit was a sublime, and, perhaps, singular union of learning with\r\nreligion. The Arnaulds, Sacy, Pascal, Tillemont, with other illustrious\r\nnames, to whom literary Europe will owe perpetual obligations, combined\r\nthe life of the monastery with that of the library.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: The early history of the house is not given quite clearly\r\nand correctly in the text. The old foundation of Cistercians, named\r\n_Port-Royal des Champs_, was situated in the valley of Chevreuse, near\r\nVersailles, and founded in 1204 by Bishop Eudes, of Paris. It was in the\r\nreign of Louis XIII. that Madame Arnauld, the mother of the then Abbess,\r\nhearing that the sisterhood suffered from the damp situation of their\r\nconvent and its confined space, purchased a house as an infirmary for\r\nits sick members in the Fauxbourg St. Jacques, and called it the\r\n_Port-Royal de Paris_, to distinguish it from the older foundation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF OLD AGE IN NEW STUDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the pleasures derivable from the cultivation of the arts, sciences,\r\nand literature, time will not abate the growing passion; for old men\r\nstill cherish an affection and feel a youthful enthusiasm in those\r\npursuits, when all others have ceased to interest. Dr. Reid, to his last\r\nday, retained a most active curiosity in his various studies, and\r\nparticularly in the revolutions of modern chemistry. In advanced life we\r\nmay resume our former studies with a new pleasure, and in old age we may\r\nenjoy them with the same relish with which more youthful students\r\ncommence. Adam Smith observed to Dugald Stewart, that \"of all the\r\namusements of old age, the most grateful and soothing is a renewal of\r\nacquaintance with the favourite studies and favourite authors of\r\nyouth--a remark, adds Stewart, which, in his own case, seemed to be more\r\nparticularly exemplified while he was reperusing, with the enthusiasm of\r\na student, the tragic poets of ancient Greece. I have heard him repeat\r\nthe observation more than once, while Sophocles and Euripides lay open\r\non his table.\"\r\n\r\nSocrates learnt to play on musical instruments in his old age; Cato, at\r\neighty, thought proper to learn Greek; and Plutarch, almost as late in\r\nhis life, Latin.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus began his admirable work on the Characters of Men at the\r\nextreme age of ninety. He only terminated his literary labours by his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nRonsard, one of the fathers of French poetry, applied himself late to\r\nstudy. His acute genius, and ardent application, rivalled those poetic\r\nmodels which he admired; and Boccaccio was thirty-five years of age when\r\nhe commenced his studies in polite literature.\r\n\r\nThe great Arnauld retained the vigour of his genius, and the command of\r\nhis pen, to the age of eighty-two, and was still the great Arnauld.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Spelman neglected the sciences in his youth, but cultivated\r\nthem at fifty years of age. His early years were chiefly passed in\r\nfarming, which greatly diverted him from his studies; but a remarkable\r\ndisappointment respecting a contested estate disgusted him with these\r\nrustic occupations: resolved to attach himself to regular studies, and\r\nliterary society, he sold his farms, and became the most learned\r\nantiquary and lawyer.\r\n\r\nColbert, the famous French minister, almost at sixty, returned to his\r\nLatin and law studies.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson applied himself to the Dutch language but a few years before\r\nhis death. The Marquis de Saint Aulaire, at the age of seventy, began to\r\ncourt the Muses, and they crowned him with their freshest flowers. The\r\nverses of this French Anacreon are full of fire, delicacy, and\r\nsweetness.\r\n\r\nChaucer's Canterbury Tales were the composition of his latest years:\r\nthey were begun in his fifty-fourth year, and finished in his\r\nsixty-first.\r\n\r\nLudovico Monaldesco, at the extraordinary age of 115, wrote the memoirs\r\nof his times. A singular exertion, noticed by Voltaire; who himself is\r\none of the most remarkable instances of the progress of age in new\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nThe most delightful of autobiographies for artists is that of Benvenuto\r\nCellini; a work of great originality, which was not begun till \"the\r\nclock of his age had struck fifty-eight.\"\r\n\r\nKoornhert began at forty to learn the Latin and Greek languages, of\r\nwhich he became a master; several students, who afterwards distinguished\r\nthemselves, have commenced as late in life their literary pursuits.\r\nOgilby, the translator of Homer and Virgil, knew little of Latin or\r\nGreek till he was past fifty; and Franklin's philosophical pursuits\r\nbegan when he had nearly reached his fiftieth year.\r\n\r\nAccorso, a great lawyer, being asked why he began the study of the law\r\nso late, answered, beginning it late, he should master it the sooner.\r\n\r\nDryden's complete works form the largest body of poetry from the pen of\r\na single writer in the English language; yet he gave no public testimony\r\nof poetic abilities till his twenty-seventh year. In his sixty-eighth\r\nyear he proposed to translate the whole Iliad: and his most pleasing\r\nproductions were written in his old age.\r\n\r\nMichael Angelo preserved his creative genius even in extreme old age:\r\nthere is a device said to be invented by him, of an old man represented\r\nin a _go-cart_, with an hour-glass upon it; the inscription _Ancora\r\nimparo!_--YET I AM LEARNING!\r\n\r\nWe have a literary curiosity in a favourite treatise with Erasmus and\r\nmen of letters of that period, _De Ratione Studii_, by Joachim Sterck,\r\notherwise Fortius de Ringelberg. The enthusiasm of the writer often\r\ncarries him to the verge of ridicule; but something must be conceded to\r\nhis peculiar situation and feelings; for Baillet tells us that this\r\nmethod of studying had been formed entirely from his own practical\r\nknowledge and hard experience: at a late period of life he had commenced\r\nhis studies, and at length he imagined that he had discovered a more\r\nperpendicular mode of ascending the hill of science than by its usual\r\ncircuitous windings. His work has been compared to the sounding of a\r\ntrumpet.\r\n\r\nMenage, in his Anti-Baillet, has a very curious apology for writing\r\nverses in his old age, by showing how many poets amused themselves\r\nnotwithstanding their grey hairs, and wrote sonnets or epigrams at\r\nninety.\r\n\r\nLa Casa, in one of his letters, humorously said, _Io credo ch'io farò\r\nSonnetti venti cinque anni, o trenta, pio che io sarò morto_.--\"I think\r\nI may make sonnets twenty-five, or perhaps thirty years, after I shall\r\nbe dead!\" Petau tells us that he wrote verses to solace the evils of old\r\nage--\r\n\r\n    ---- Petavius æger\r\n    Cantabat veteris quærens solatia morbi.\r\n\r\nMalherbe declares the honours of genius were his, yet young--\r\n\r\n    Je les posseday jeune, et les possède encore\r\n        A la fin de mes jours!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH POETRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPere Bouhours observes, that the Spanish poets display an extravagant\r\nimagination, which is by no means destitute of _esprit_--shall we say\r\n_wit_? but which evinces little taste or judgment.\r\n\r\nTheir verses are much in the style of our Cowley--trivial points,\r\nmonstrous metaphors, and quaint conceits. It is evident that the Spanish\r\npoets imported this taste from the time of Marino in Italy; but the\r\nwarmth of the Spanish climate appears to have redoubled it, and to have\r\nblown the kindled sparks of chimerical fancy to the heat of a Vulcanian\r\nforge.\r\n\r\nLopez de Vega, in describing an afflicted shepherdess, in one of his\r\npastorals, who is represented weeping near the sea-side, says, \"That the\r\nsea joyfully advances to gather her tears; and that, having enclosed\r\nthem in shells, it converts them into pearls.\"\r\n\r\n        \"Y el mar como imbidioso\r\n        A tierra por las lagrimas salia,\r\n        Y alegre de cogerlas\r\n    Las guarda en conchas, y convierte en perlas.\"\r\n\r\nVillegas addresses a stream--\"Thou who runnest over sands of gold, with\r\nfeet of silver,\" more elegant than our Shakspeare's--\"Thy silver skin\r\nlaced with thy golden blood,\" which possibly he may not have written.\r\nVillegas monstrously exclaims, \"Touch my breast, if you doubt the power\r\nof Lydia's eyes--you will find it turned to ashes.\" Again--\"Thou art so\r\ngreat that thou canst only imitate thyself with thy own greatness;\" much\r\nlike our \"None but himself can be his parallel.\"\r\n\r\nGongora, whom the Spaniards once greatly admired, and distinguished by\r\nthe epithet of _The Wonderful_, abounds with these conceits.\r\n\r\nHe imagines that a nightingale, who enchantingly varied her notes, and\r\nsang in different manners, had a hundred thousand other nightingales in\r\nher breast, which alternately sang through her throat--\r\n\r\n    \"Con diferancia tal, con gracia tanta,\r\n    A quel ruysenor llora, que sospecho\r\n    Que tiene otros cien mil dentro del pecho,\r\n    Que alterno su dolor por su garganta.\"\r\n\r\nOf a young and beautiful lady he says, that she has but a few _years_ of\r\nlife, but many _ages_ of beauty.\r\n\r\n    \"Muchos siglos de hermosura\r\n    En pocos anos de edad.\"\r\n\r\nMany ages of beauty is a false thought, for beauty becomes not more\r\nbeautiful from its age; it would be only a superannuated beauty. A face\r\nof two or three ages old could have but few charms.\r\n\r\nIn one of his odes he addresses the River of Madrid by the title of the\r\n_Duke of Streams_, and the _Viscount of Rivers_--\r\n\r\n    \"Mançanares, Mançanares,\r\n    Os que en todo el aguatismo,\r\n    Estois _Duque_ de Arroyos,\r\n    Y _Visconde_ de los Rios.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not venture to call it a _Spanish Grandee_, for, in fact, it is\r\nbut a shallow and dirty stream; and as Quevedo wittily informs us,\r\n\"_Mançanares_ is reduced, during the summer season, to the melancholy\r\ncondition of the wicked rich man, who asks for water in the depths of\r\nhell.\" Though so small, this stream in the time of a flood spreads\r\nitself over the neighbouring fields; for this reason Philip the Second\r\nbuilt a bridge eleven hundred feet long!--A Spaniard passing it one day,\r\nwhen it was perfectly dry, observing this superb bridge, archly\r\nremarked, \"That it would be proper that the bridge should be sold to\r\npurchase water.\"--_Es menester, vender la puente, par comprar agua._\r\n\r\nThe following elegant translation of a Spanish madrigal of the kind here\r\ncriticised I found in a newspaper, but it is evidently by a master-hand.\r\n\r\n    On the green margin of the land,\r\n      Where Guadalhorce winds his way,\r\n      My lady lay:\r\n    With golden key Sleep's gentle hand\r\n      Had closed her eyes so bright--\r\n      Her eyes, two suns of light--\r\n      And bade his balmy dews\r\n      Her rosy cheeks suffuse.\r\n    The River God in slumber saw her laid:\r\n      He raised his dripping head,\r\n      With weeds o'erspread,\r\n    Clad in his wat'ry robes approach'd the maid,\r\n    And with cold kiss, like death,\r\n      Drank the rich perfume of the maiden's breath.\r\n    The maiden felt that icy kiss:\r\n      _Her suns unclosed, their flame_\r\n      Full and unclouded on th' intruder came.\r\n      Amazed th' intruder felt\r\n      _His frothy body melt\r\n    And heard the radiance on his bosom hiss_;\r\n      And, forced in blind confusion to retire,\r\n      _Leapt in the water to escape the fire_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT EVREMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe portrait of St. Evremond is delineated by his own hand.\r\n\r\nIn his day it was a literary fashion for writers to give their own\r\nportraits; a fashion that seems to have passed over into our country,\r\nfor Farquhar has drawn his own character in a letter to a lady. Others\r\nof our writers have given these self-miniatures. Such painters are, no\r\ndoubt, great flatterers, and it is rather their ingenuity, than their\r\ntruth, which we admire in these cabinet-pictures.\r\n\r\n\"I am a philosopher, as far removed from superstition as from impiety; a\r\nvoluptuary, who has not less abhorrence of debauchery than inclination\r\nfor pleasure; a man who has never known want nor abundance. I occupy\r\nthat station of life which is contemned by those who possess everything;\r\nenvied by those who have nothing; and only relished by those who make\r\ntheir felicity consist in the exercise of their reason. Young, I hated\r\ndissipation; convinced that man must possess wealth to provide for the\r\ncomforts of a long life. Old, I disliked economy; as I believe that we\r\nneed not greatly dread want, when we have but a short time to be\r\nmiserable. I am satisfied with what nature has done for me, nor do I\r\nrepine at fortune. I do not seek in men what they have of evil, that I\r\nmay censure; I only discover what they have ridiculous, that I may be\r\namused. I feel a pleasure in detecting their follies; I should feel a\r\ngreater in communicating my discoveries, did not my prudence restrain\r\nme. Life is too short, according to my ideas, to read all kinds of\r\nbooks, and to load our memories with an endless number of things at the\r\ncost of our judgment. I do not attach myself to the observations of\r\nscientific men to acquire science; but to the most rational, that I may\r\nstrengthen my reason. Sometimes I seek for more delicate minds, that my\r\ntaste may imbibe their delicacy; sometimes for the gayer, that I may\r\nenrich my genius with their gaiety; and, although I constantly read, I\r\nmake it less my occupation than my pleasure. In religion, and in\r\nfriendship, I have only to paint myself such as I am--in friendship more\r\ntender than a philosopher; and in religion, as constant and as sincere\r\nas a youth who has more simplicity than experience. My piety is composed\r\nmore of justice and charity than of penitence. I rest my confidence on\r\nGod, and hope everything from His benevolence. In the bosom of\r\nProvidence I find my repose, and my felicity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEN OF GENIUS DEFICIENT IN CONVERSATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe student or the artist who may shine a luminary of learning and of\r\ngenius, in his works, is found, not rarely, to lie obscured beneath a\r\nheavy cloud in colloquial discourse.\r\n\r\nIf you love the man of letters, seek him in the privacies of his study.\r\nIt is in the hour of confidence and tranquillity that his genius shall\r\nelicit a ray of intelligence more fervid than the labours of polished\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nThe great Peter Corneille, whose genius resembled that of our\r\nShakspeare, and who has so forcibly expressed the sublime sentiments of\r\nthe hero, had nothing in his exterior that indicated his genius; his\r\nconversation was so insipid that it never failed of wearying. Nature,\r\nwho had lavished on him the gifts of genius, had forgotten to blend with\r\nthem her more ordinary ones. He did not even _speak_ correctly that\r\nlanguage of which he was such a master. When his friends represented to\r\nhim how much more he might please by not disdaining to correct these\r\ntrivial errors, he would smile, and say--\"_I am not the less Peter\r\nCorneille!_\"\r\n\r\nDescartes, whose habits were formed in solitude and meditation, was\r\nsilent in mixed company; it was said that he had received his\r\nintellectual wealth from nature in solid bars, but not in current coin;\r\nor as Addison expressed the same idea, by comparing himself to a banker\r\nwho possessed the wealth of his friends at home, though he carried none\r\nof it in his pocket; or as that judicious moralist Nicolle, of the\r\nPort-Royal Society, said of a scintillant wit--\"He conquers me in the\r\ndrawing-room, but he surrenders to me at discretion on the staircase.\"\r\nSuch may say with Themistocles, when asked to play on a lute--\"I cannot\r\nfiddle, but I can make a little village a great city.\"\r\n\r\nThe deficiencies of Addison in conversation are well known. He preserved\r\na rigid silence amongst strangers; but if he was silent, it was the\r\nsilence of meditation. How often, at that moment, he laboured at some\r\nfuture Spectator!\r\n\r\nMediocrity can _talk_; but it is for genius to _observe_.\r\n\r\nThe cynical Mandeville compared Addison, after having passed an evening\r\nin his company, to \"a silent parson in a tie-wig.\"\r\n\r\nVirgil was heavy in conversation, and resembled more an ordinary man\r\nthan an enchanting poet.\r\n\r\nLa Fontaine, says La Bruyère, appeared coarse, heavy, and stupid; he\r\ncould not speak or describe what he had just seen; but when he wrote he\r\nwas a model of poetry.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy, said a humorous observer on La Fontaine, to be a man of\r\nwit, or a fool; but to be both, and that too in the extreme degree, is\r\nindeed admirable, and only to be found in him. This observation applies\r\nto that fine natural genius Goldsmith. Chaucer was more facetious in his\r\ntales than in his conversation, and the Countess of Pembroke used to\r\nrally him by saying, that his silence was more agreeable to her than his\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nIsocrates, celebrated for his beautiful oratorical compositions, was of\r\nso timid a disposition, that he never ventured to speak in public. He\r\ncompared himself to the whetstone which will not cut, but enables other\r\nthings to do so; for his productions served as models to other orators.\r\nVaucanson was said to be as much a machine as any he had made.\r\n\r\nDryden says of himself--\"My conversation is slow and dull, my humour\r\nsaturnine and reserved. In short, I am none of those who endeavour to\r\nbreak jests in company, or make repartees.\"[41]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a consolation for an aged parent to see his child, by the efforts\r\nof his own merits, attain from the humblest obscurity to distinguished\r\neminence! What a transport for the man of sensibility to return to the\r\nobscure dwelling of his parent, and to embrace him, adorned with public\r\nhonours! Poor _Vida_ was deprived of this satisfaction; but he is placed\r\nhigher in our esteem by the present anecdote, than even by that classic\r\ncomposition, which rivals the Art of Poetry of his great master.\r\n\r\n_Jerome Vida_, after having long served two Popes, at length attained to\r\nthe episcopacy. Arrayed in the robes of his new dignity, he prepared to\r\nvisit his aged parents, and felicitated himself with the raptures which\r\nthe old couple would feel in embracing their son as their bishop. When\r\nhe arrived at their village, he learnt that it was but a few days since\r\nthey were no more. His sensibilities were exquisitely pained. The muse\r\ndictated some elegiac verse, and in the solemn pathos deplored the death\r\nand the disappointment of his parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCUDERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bien heureux SCUDERY, dont la fertile plume\r\n    Peut tous les mois sans peine enfanter un volume.\r\n\r\nBoileau has written this couplet on the Scuderies, the brother and\r\nsister, both famous in their day for composing romances, which they\r\nsometimes extended to ten or twelve volumes. It was the favourite\r\nliterature of that period, as novels are now. Our nobility not\r\nunfrequently condescended to translate these voluminous compositions.\r\n\r\nThe diminutive size of our modern novels is undoubtedly an improvement:\r\nbut, in resembling the size of primers, it were to be wished that their\r\ncontents had also resembled their inoffensive pages. Our\r\ngreat-grandmothers were incommoded with overgrown folios; and, instead\r\nof finishing the eventful history of two lovers at one or two sittings,\r\nit was sometimes six months, _including Sundays_, before they could get\r\nquit of their Clelias, their Cyrus's, and Parthenissas.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Scudery had composed _ninety volumes_! She had even\r\nfinished another romance, which she would not give the public, whose\r\ntaste, she perceived, no more relished this kind of works. She was one\r\nof those unfortunate authors who, living to more than ninety years of\r\nage, survive their own celebrity.\r\n\r\nShe had her panegyrists in her day: Menage observes--\"What a pleasing\r\ndescription has Mademoiselle Scudery made, in her Cyrus, of the little\r\ncourt at Rambouillet! A thousand things in the romances of this learned\r\nlady render them inestimable. She has drawn from the ancients their\r\nhappiest passages, and has even improved upon them; like the prince in\r\nthe fable, whatever she touches becomes gold. We may read her works with\r\ngreat profit, if we possess a correct taste, and love instruction. Those\r\nwho censure their _length_ only show the littleness of their judgment;\r\nas if Homer and Virgil were to be despised, because many of their books\r\nwere filled with episodes and incidents that necessarily retard the\r\nconclusion. It does not require much penetration to observe that _Cyrus_\r\nand _Clelia_ are a species of the _epic_ poem. The epic must embrace a\r\nnumber of events to suspend the course of the narrative; which, only\r\ntaking in a part of the life of the hero, would terminate too soon to\r\ndisplay the skill of the poet. Without this artifice, the charm of\r\nuniting the greater part of the episodes to the principal subject of the\r\nromance would be lost. Mademoiselle de Scudery has so well treated them,\r\nand so aptly introduced a variety of beautiful passages, that nothing in\r\nthis kind is comparable to her productions. Some expressions, and\r\ncertain turns, have become somewhat obsolete; all the rest will last\r\nfor ever, and outlive the criticisms they have undergone.\"\r\n\r\nMenage has here certainly uttered a false prophecy. The curious only\r\nlook over her romances. They contain doubtless many beautiful\r\ninventions; the misfortune is, that _time_ and _patience_ are rare\r\nrequisites for the enjoyment of these Iliads in prose.\r\n\r\n\"The misfortune of her having written too abundantly has occasioned an\r\nunjust contempt,\" says a French critic. \"We confess there are many heavy\r\nand tedious passages in her voluminous romances; but if we consider that\r\nin the Clelia and the Artamene are to be found inimitable delicate\r\ntouches, and many splendid parts, which would do honour to some of our\r\nliving writers, we must acknowledge that the great defects of all her\r\nworks arise from her not writing in an age when taste had reached the\r\n_acmé_ of cultivation. Such is her erudition, that the French place her\r\nnext to the celebrated Madame Dacier. Her works, containing many secret\r\nintrigues of the court and city, her readers must have keenly relished\r\non their early publication.\"\r\n\r\nHer Artamene, or the Great Cyrus, and principally her Clelia, are\r\nrepresentations of what then passed at the court of France. The _Map_ of\r\nthe _Kingdom of Tenderness_, in Clelia, appeared, at the time, as one of\r\nthe happiest inventions. This once celebrated _map_ is an allegory which\r\ndistinguishes the different kinds of TENDERNESS, which are reduced to\r\n_Esteem_, _Gratitude_, and _Inclination_. The map represents three\r\nrivers, which have these three names, and on which are situated three\r\ntowns called Tenderness: Tenderness on _Inclination_; Tenderness on\r\n_Esteem_; and Tenderness on _Gratitude_. _Pleasing Attentions_, or,\r\n_Petits Soins_, is a _village_ very beautifully situated. Mademoiselle\r\nde Scudery was extremely proud of this little allegorical map; and had a\r\nterrible controversy with another writer about its originality.\r\n\r\nGEORGE SCUDERY, her brother, and inferior in genius, had a striking\r\nsingularity of character:--he was one of the most complete votaries to\r\nthe universal divinity, Vanity. With a heated imagination, entirely\r\ndestitute of judgment, his military character was continually exhibiting\r\nitself by that peaceful instrument the pen, so that he exhibits a most\r\namusing contrast of ardent feelings in a cool situation; not liberally\r\nendowed with genius, but abounding with its semblance in the fire of\r\neccentric gasconade; no man has portrayed his own character with a\r\nbolder colouring than himself, in his numerous prefaces and addresses;\r\nsurrounded by a thousand self-illusions of the most sublime class,\r\neverything that related to himself had an Homeric grandeur of\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nIn an epistle to the Duke of Montmorency, Scudery says, \"I will learn to\r\nwrite with my left hand, that my right hand may more nobly be devoted to\r\nyour service;\" and alluding to his pen (_plume_), declares \"he comes\r\nfrom a family who never used one, but to stick in their hats.\" When he\r\nsolicits small favours from the great, he assures them \"that princes\r\nmust not think him importunate, and that his writings are merely\r\ninspired by his own individual interest; no! (he exclaims) I am studious\r\nonly of your glory, while I am careless of my own fortune.\" And indeed,\r\nto do him justice, he acted up to these romantic feelings. After he had\r\npublished his epic of Alaric, Christina of Sweden proposed to honour him\r\nwith a chain of gold of the value of five hundred pounds, provided he\r\nwould expunge from his epic the eulogiums he bestowed on the Count of\r\nGardie, whom she had disgraced. The epical soul of Scudery magnanimously\r\nscorned the bribe, and replied, that \"If the chain of gold should be as\r\nweighty as that chain mentioned in the history of the Incas, I will\r\nnever destroy any altar on which I have sacrificed!\"\r\n\r\nProud of his boasted nobility and erratic life, he thus addresses the\r\nreader: \"You will lightly pass over any faults in my work, if you\r\nreflect that I have employed the greater part of my life in seeing the\r\nfinest parts of Europe, and that I have passed more days in the camp\r\nthan in the library. I have used more matches to light my musket than to\r\nlight my candles; I know better to arrange columns in the field than\r\nthose on paper; and to square battalions better than to round periods.\"\r\nIn his first publication, he began his literary career perfectly in\r\ncharacter, by a challenge to his critics!\r\n\r\nHe is the author of sixteen plays, chiefly heroic tragedies; children\r\nwho all bear the features of their father. He first introduced, in his\r\n\"L'Amour Tyrannique,\" a strict observance of the Aristotelian unities of\r\ntime and place; and the necessity and advantages of this regulation are\r\ninsisted on, which only shows that Aristotle's art goes but little to\r\nthe composition of a pathetic tragedy. In his last drama, \"Arminius,\"\r\nhe extravagantly scatters his panegyrics on its fifteen predecessors;\r\nbut of the present one he has the most exalted notion: it is the\r\nquintessence of Scudery! An ingenious critic calls it \"The downfall of\r\nmediocrity!\" It is amusing to listen to this blazing preface:--\"At\r\nlength, reader, nothing remains for me but to mention the great Arminius\r\nwhich I now present to you, and by which I have resolved to close my\r\nlong and laborious course. It is indeed my masterpiece! and the most\r\nfinished work that ever came from my pen; for whether we examine the\r\nfable, the manners, the sentiments, or the versification, it is certain\r\nthat I never performed anything so just, so great, nor more beautiful;\r\nand if my labours could ever deserve a crown, I would claim it for this\r\nwork!\"\r\n\r\nThe actions of this singular personage were in unison with his writings:\r\nhe gives a pompous description of a most unimportant government which he\r\nobtained near Marseilles, but all the grandeur existed only in our\r\nauthor's heated imagination. Bachaumont and De la Chapelle describe it,\r\nin their playful \"Voyage:\"\r\n\r\n    Mais il faut vous parler du fort,\r\n    Qui sans doute est une merveille;\r\n    C'est notre dame de la garde!\r\n    Gouvernement commode et beau,\r\n    A qui suffit pour tout garde,\r\n    Un Suisse avec sa hallebarde\r\n    Peint sur la porte du château!\r\n\r\nA fort very commodiously guarded; only requiring one sentinel with his\r\nhalbert--painted on the door!\r\n\r\nIn a poem on his disgust with the world, he tells us how intimate he has\r\nbeen with princes: Europe has known him through all her provinces; he\r\nventured everything in a thousand combats:\r\n\r\n    L'on me vit obeïr, l'on me vit commander,\r\n    Et mon poil tout poudreux a blanchi sons les armes;\r\n    Il est peu de beaux arts où je ne sois instruit;\r\n    En prose et en vers, mon nom fit quelque bruit;\r\n    Et par plus d'un chemin je parvins à la gloire.\r\n\r\n    IMITATED.\r\n\r\n    Princes were proud my friendship to proclaim,\r\n    And Europe gazed, where'er her hero came!\r\n    I grasp'd the laurels of heroic strife,\r\n    The thousand perils of a soldier's life;\r\n    Obedient in the ranks each toilful day!\r\n    Though heroes soon command, they first obey.\r\n\r\n    'Twas not for me, too long a time to yield!\r\n    Born for a chieftain in the tented field!\r\n    Around my plumed helm, my silvery hair\r\n    Hung like an honour'd wreath of age and care!\r\n    The finer arts have charm'd my studious hours,\r\n    Versed in their mysteries, skilful in their powers;\r\n    In verse and prose my equal genius glow'd,\r\n    Pursuing glory by no single road!\r\n\r\nSuch was the vain George Scudery! whose heart, however, was warm:\r\npoverty could never degrade him; adversity never broke down his\r\nmagnanimous spirit!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The same is reported of Butler; and it is said that\r\nCharles II. declared he could not believe him to be the author of\r\n_Hudibras_; that witty poem being such a contradiction to his heavy\r\nmanners.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maxims of this noble author are in the hands of every one. To those\r\nwho choose to derive every motive and every action from the solitary\r\nprinciple of _self-love_, they are inestimable. They form one continued\r\nsatire on human nature; but they are not reconcilable to the feelings of\r\nthe man of better sympathies, or to him who passes through life with the\r\nfirm integrity of virtue. Even at court we find a Sully, a Malesherbes,\r\nand a Clarendon, as well as a Rouchefoucault and a Chesterfield.\r\n\r\nThe Duke de la Rochefoucault, says Segrais, had not studied; but he was\r\nendowed with a wonderful degree of discernment, and knew the world\r\nperfectly well. This afforded him opportunities of making reflections,\r\nand reducing into maxims those discoveries which he had made in the\r\nheart of man, of which he displayed an admirable knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps worthy of observation, that this celebrated French duke\r\ncould never summon resolution, at his election, to address the Academy.\r\nAlthough chosen a member, he never entered, for such was his timidity,\r\nthat he could not face an audience and deliver the usual compliment on\r\nhis introduction; he whose courage, whose birth, and whose genius were\r\nalike distinguished. The fact is, as appears by Mad. de Sévigné, that\r\nRochefoucault lived a close domestic life; there must be at least as\r\nmuch _theoretical_ as _practical_ knowledge in the opinions of such a\r\nretired philosopher.\r\n\r\nChesterfield, our English Rochefoucault, we are also informed, possessed\r\nan admirable knowledge of the heart of man; and he, too, has drawn a\r\nsimilar picture of human nature. These are two _noble authors_ whose\r\nchief studies seem to have been made in _courts_. May it not be\r\npossible, allowing these authors not to have written a sentence of\r\napocrypha, that the fault lies not so much in _human nature_ as in the\r\nsatellites of Power breathing their corrupt atmosphere?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIOR'S HANS CARVEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere we to investigate the genealogy of our best modern stories, we\r\nshould often discover the illegitimacy of our favourites; and retrace\r\nthem frequently to the East. My well-read friend Douce had collected\r\nmaterials for such a work. The genealogies of tales would have gratified\r\nthe curious in literature.\r\n\r\nThe story of the ring of Hans Carvel is of very ancient standing, as are\r\nmost of the tales of this kind.\r\n\r\nMenage says that Poggius, who died in 1459, has the merit of its\r\ninvention; but I suspect he only related a very popular story.\r\n\r\nRabelais, who has given it in his peculiar manner, changed its original\r\nname of Philelphus to that of Hans Carvel.\r\n\r\nThis title is likewise in the eleventh of _Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles_\r\ncollected in 1461, for the amusement of Louis XI. when Dauphin, and\r\nliving in solitude.\r\n\r\nAriosto has borrowed it, at the end of his fifth Satire; but has fairly\r\nappropriated it by his pleasant manner.\r\n\r\nIn a collection of novels at Lyons, in 1555, it is introduced into the\r\neleventh novel.\r\n\r\nCelio Malespini has it again in page 288 of the second part of his Two\r\nHundred Novels, printed at Venice in 1609.\r\n\r\nFontaine has prettily set it off, and an anonymous writer has composed\r\nit in Latin Anacreontic verses; and at length our Prior has given it\r\nwith equal gaiety and freedom. After Ariosto, La Fontaine, and Prior,\r\nlet us hear of it no more; yet this has been done, in a manner, however,\r\nwhich here cannot be told.\r\n\r\nVoltaire has a curious essay to show that most of our best modern\r\nstories and plots originally belonged to the eastern nations, a fact\r\nwhich has been made more evident by recent researches. The Amphitryon of\r\nMolière was an imitation of Plautus, who borrowed it from the Greeks,\r\nand they took it from the Indians! It is given by Dow in his History of\r\nHindostan. In Captain Scott's Tales and Anecdotes from Arabian writers,\r\nwe are surprised at finding so many of our favourites very ancient\r\norientalists.--The Ephesian Matron, versified by La Fontaine, was\r\nborrowed from the Italians; it is to be found in Petronius, and\r\nPetronius had it from the Greeks. But where did the Greeks find it? In\r\nthe Arabian Tales! And from whence did the Arabian fabulists borrow it?\r\nFrom the Chinese! It is found in Du Halde, who collected it from the\r\nVersions of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STUDENT IN THE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA man of letters, more intent on the acquisitions of literature than on\r\nthe intrigues of politics, or the speculations of commerce, may find a\r\ndeeper solitude in a populous metropolis than in the seclusion of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe student, who is no flatterer of the little passions of men, will not\r\nbe much incommoded by their presence. Gibbon paints his own situation in\r\nthe heart of the fashionable world:--\"I had not been endowed by art or\r\nnature with those happy gifts of confidence and address which unlock\r\nevery door and every bosom. While coaches were rattling through\r\nBond-street, I have passed many a solitary evening in my lodging with my\r\nbooks. I withdrew without reluctance from the noisy and extensive scene\r\nof crowds without company, and dissipation without pleasure.\" And even\r\nafter he had published the first volume of his History, he observes that\r\nin London his confinement was solitary and sad; \"the many forgot my\r\nexistence when they saw me no longer at Brookes's, and the few who\r\nsometimes had a thought on their friend were detained by business or\r\npleasure, and I was proud and happy if I could prevail on my bookseller,\r\nElmsly, to enliven the dulness of the evening.\"\r\n\r\nA situation, very elegantly described in the beautifully polished verses\r\nof Mr. Rogers, in his \"Epistle to a Friend:\"\r\n\r\n    When from his classic dreams the student steals\r\n    Amid the buzz of crowds, the whirl of wheels,\r\n    To muse unnoticed, while around him press\r\n    The meteor-forms of equipage and dress;\r\n    Alone in wonder lost, he seems to stand\r\n    A very stranger in his native land.\r\n\r\nHe compares the student to one of the seven sleepers in the ancient\r\nlegend.\r\n\r\nDescartes residing in the commercial city of Amsterdam, writing to\r\nBalzac, illustrates these descriptions with great force and vivacity.\r\n\r\n\"You wish to retire; and your intention is to seek the solitude of the\r\nChartreux, or, possibly, some of the most beautiful provinces of France\r\nand Italy. I would rather advise you, if you wish to observe mankind,\r\nand at the same time to lose yourself in the deepest solitude, to join\r\nme in Amsterdam. I prefer this situation to that even of your delicious\r\nvilla, where I spent so great a part of the last year; for, however\r\nagreeable a country-house may be, a thousand little conveniences are\r\nwanted, which can only be found in a city. One is not alone so\r\nfrequently in the country as one could wish: a number of impertinent\r\nvisitors are continually besieging you. Here, as all the world, except\r\nmyself, is occupied in commerce, it depends merely on myself to live\r\nunknown to the world. I walk every day amongst immense ranks of people,\r\nwith as much tranquillity as you do in your green alleys. The men I meet\r\nwith make the same impression on my mind as would the trees of your\r\nforests, or the flocks of sheep grazing on your common. The busy hum too\r\nof these merchants does not disturb one more than the purling of your\r\nbrooks. If sometimes I amuse myself in contemplating their anxious\r\nmotions, I receive the same pleasure which you do in observing those men\r\nwho cultivate your land; for I reflect that the end of all their labours\r\nis to embellish the city which I inhabit, and to anticipate all my\r\nwants. If you contemplate with delight the fruits of your orchards, with\r\nall the rich promises of abundance, do you think I feel less in\r\nobserving so many fleets that convey to me the productions of either\r\nIndia? What spot on earth could you find, which, like this, can so\r\ninterest your vanity and gratify your taste?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TALMUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe JEWS have their TALMUD; the CATHOLICS their LEGENDS of Saints; and\r\nthe TURKS their SONNAH. The PROTESTANT has nothing but his BIBLE. The\r\nformer are three kindred works. Men have imagined that the more there is\r\nto be believed, the more are the merits of the believer. Hence all\r\n_traditionists_ formed the orthodox and the strongest party. The word\r\nof God is lost amidst those heaps of human inventions, sanctioned by an\r\norder of men connected with religious duties; they ought now, however,\r\nto be regarded rather as CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE. I give a\r\nsufficiently ample account of the TALMUD and the LEGENDS; but of the\r\nSONNAH I only know that it is a collection of the traditional opinions\r\nof the Turkish prophets, directing the observance of petty superstitions\r\nnot mentioned in the Koran.\r\n\r\nThe TALMUD is a collection of Jewish traditions which have been _orally_\r\npreserved. It comprises the MISHNA, which is the text; and the GEMARA,\r\nits commentary. The whole forms a complete system of the learning,\r\nceremonies, civil and canon laws of the Jews; treating indeed on all\r\nsubjects; even gardening, manual arts, &c. The rigid Jews persuaded\r\nthemselves that these traditional explications are of divine origin. The\r\nPentateuch, say they, was written out by their legislator before his\r\ndeath in thirteen copies, distributed among the twelve tribes, and the\r\nremaining one deposited in the ark. The oral law Moses continually\r\ntaught in the Sanhedrim, to the elders and the rest of the people. The\r\nlaw was repeated four times; but the interpretation was delivered only\r\nby _word of mouth_ from generation to generation. In the fortieth year\r\nof the flight from Egypt, the memory of the people became treacherous,\r\nand Moses was constrained to repeat this oral law, which had been\r\nconveyed by successive traditionists. Such is the account of honest\r\nDavid Levi; it is the creed of every rabbin.--David believed in\r\neverything but in Jesus.\r\n\r\nThis history of the Talmud some inclined to suppose apocryphal, even\r\namong a few of the Jews themselves. When these traditions first\r\nappeared, the keenest controversy has never been able to determine. It\r\ncannot be denied that there existed traditions among the Jews in the\r\ntime of Jesus Christ. About the second century, they were industriously\r\ncollected by Rabbi Juda the Holy, the prince of the rabbins, who enjoyed\r\nthe favour of Antoninus Pius. He has the merit of giving some order to\r\nthis multifarious collection.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the Talmud was compiled by certain Jewish doctors, who\r\nwere solicited for this purpose by their nation, that they might have\r\nsomething to oppose to their Christian adversaries.\r\n\r\nThe learned W. Wotton, in his curious \"Discourses\" on the traditions of\r\nthe Scribes and Pharisees, supplies an analysis of this vast collection;\r\nhe has translated entire two divisions of this code of traditional laws,\r\nwith the original text and the notes.\r\n\r\nThere are two Talmuds: the Jerusalem and the Babylonian. The last is the\r\nmost esteemed, because it is the most bulky.\r\n\r\nR. Juda, the prince of the rabbins, committed to writing all these\r\ntraditions, and arranged them under six general heads, called orders or\r\nclasses. The subjects are indeed curious for philosophical inquirers,\r\nand multifarious as the events of civil life. Every _order_ is formed of\r\n_treatises_; every _treatise_ is divided into chapters, every _chapter_\r\ninto _mishnas_, which word means mixtures or miscellanies, in the form\r\nof _aphorisms_. In the first part is discussed what relates to _seeds_,\r\n_fruits_, and _trees_; in the second, _feasts_; in the third, _women_,\r\ntheir duties, their _disorders_, _marriages_, _divorces_, _contracts_,\r\nand _nuptials_; in the fourth, are treated the damages or losses\r\nsustained by beasts or men; of _things found_; _deposits_; _usuries_;\r\n_rents_; _farms_; _partnerships_ in commerce; _inheritance_; _sales_ and\r\n_purchases_; _oaths_; _witnesses_; _arrests_; _idolatry_; and here are\r\nnamed those by whom the oral law was received and preserved. In the\r\nfifth part are noticed _sacrifices_ and _holy things_; and the sixth\r\ntreats of _purifications_; _vessels_; _furniture_; _clothes_; _houses_;\r\n_leprosy_; _baths_; and numerous other articles. All this forms the\r\nMISHNA.\r\n\r\nThe GEMARA, that is, the _complement_ or _perfection_, contains the\r\nDISPUTES and the OPINIONS of the RABBINS on the oral traditions. Their\r\nlast decisions. It must be confessed that absurdities are sometimes\r\nelucidated by other absurdities; but there are many admirable things in\r\nthis vast repository. The Jews have such veneration for this\r\ncompilation, that they compare the holy writings to _water_, and the\r\nTalmud to _wine_; the text of Moses to _pepper_, but the Talmud to\r\n_aromatics_. Of the twelve hours of which the day is composed, they tell\r\nus that _God_ employs nine to study the Talmud, and only three to read\r\nthe written law!\r\n\r\nSt. Jerome appears evidently to allude to this work, and notices its\r\n\"Old Wives' Tales,\" and the filthiness of some of its matters. The truth\r\nis, that the rabbins resembled the Jesuits and Casuists; and Sanchez's\r\nwork on \"_Matrimonio_\" is well known to agitate matters with such\r\n_scrupulous niceties_ as to become the most offensive thing possible.\r\nBut as among the schoolmen and casuists there have been great men, the\r\nsame happened to these Gemaraists. Maimonides was a pillar of light\r\namong their darkness. The antiquity of this work is of itself sufficient\r\nto make it very curious.\r\n\r\nA specimen of the topics may be shown from the table and contents of\r\n\"Mishnic Titles.\" In the order of seeds, we find the following heads,\r\nwhich present no uninteresting picture of the pastoral and pious\r\nceremonies of the ancient Jews.\r\n\r\nThe Mishna, entitled the _Corner_, i.e. of the field. The laws of\r\ngleaning are commanded according to Leviticus; xix. 9, 10. Of the corner\r\nto be left in a corn-field. When the corner is due and when not. Of the\r\nforgotten sheaf. Of the ears of corn left in gathering. Of grapes left\r\nupon the vine. Of olives left upon the trees. When and where the poor\r\nmay lawfully glean. What sheaf, or olives, or grapes, may be looked upon\r\nto be forgotten, and what not. Who are the proper witnesses concerning\r\nthe poor's due, to exempt it from tithing, &c. They distinguished\r\nuncircumcised fruit:--it is unlawful to eat of the fruit of any tree\r\ntill the fifth year of its growth: the first three years of its bearing,\r\nit is called uncircumcised; the fourth is offered to God; and the fifth\r\nmay be eaten.\r\n\r\nThe Mishna, entitled _Heterogeneous Mixtures_, contains several curious\r\nhorticultural particulars. Of divisions between garden-beds and fields,\r\nthat the produce of the several sorts of grains or seeds may appear\r\ndistinct. Of the distance between every species. Distances between vines\r\nplanted in corn-fields from one another and from the corn; between vines\r\nplanted against hedges, walls, or espaliers, and anything sowed near\r\nthem. Various cases relating to vineyards planted near any forbidden\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nIn their seventh, or sabbatical year, in which the produce of all\r\nestates was given up to the poor, one of these regulations is on the\r\ndifferent work which must not be omitted in the sixth year, lest\r\n(because the seventh being devoted to the poor) the produce should be\r\nunfairly diminished, and the public benefit arising from this law be\r\nfrustrated. Of whatever is not perennial, and produced that year by the\r\nearth, no money may be made; but what is perennial may be sold.\r\n\r\nOn priests' tithes, we have a regulation concerning eating the fruits\r\ncarried to the place where they are to be separated.\r\n\r\nThe order _women_ is very copious. A husband is obliged to forbid his\r\nwife to keep a particular man's company before two witnesses. Of the\r\nwaters of jealousy by which a suspected woman is to be tried by\r\ndrinking, we find ample particulars. The ceremonies of clothing the\r\naccused woman at her trial. Pregnant women, or who suckle, are not\r\nobliged to drink for the rabbins seem to be well convinced of the\r\neffects of the imagination. Of their divorces many are the laws; and\r\ncare is taken to particularise bills of divorces written by men in\r\ndelirium or dangerously ill. One party of the rabbins will not allow of\r\nany divorce, unless something light was found in the woman's character,\r\nwhile another (the Pharisees) allow divorces even when a woman has only\r\nbeen so unfortunate as to suffer her husband's soup to be burnt!\r\n\r\nIn the order of _damages_, containing rules how to tax the damages done\r\nby man or beast, or other casualties, their distinctions are as nice as\r\ntheir cases are numerous. What beasts are innocent and what convict. By\r\nthe one they mean creatures not naturally used to do mischief in any\r\nparticular way; and by the other, those that naturally, or by a vicious\r\nhabit, are mischievous that way. The tooth of a beast is convict, when\r\nit is proved to eat its usual food, the property of another man, and\r\nfull restitution must be made; but if a beast that is used to eat fruits\r\nand herbs gnaws clothes or damages tools, which are not its usual food,\r\nthe owner of the beast shall pay but half the damage when committed on\r\nthe property of the injured person; but if the injury is committed on\r\nthe property of the person who does the damage, he is free, because the\r\nbeast gnawed what was not its usual food. As thus; if the beast of A.\r\ngnaws or tears the clothes of B. in B.'s house or grounds, A. shall pay\r\nhalf the damages; but if B.'s clothes are injured in A.'s grounds by\r\nA.'s beast, A. is free, for what had B. to do to put his clothes in A.'s\r\ngrounds? They made such subtile distinctions, as when an ox gores a man\r\nor beast, the law inquired into the habits of the beast; whether it was\r\nan ox that used to gore, or an ox that was not used to gore. However\r\nacute these niceties sometimes were, they were often ridiculous. No\r\nbeast could be _convicted_ of being vicious till evidence was given that\r\nhe had done mischief three successive days; but if he leaves off those\r\nvicious tricks for three days more, he is innocent again. An ox may be\r\nconvict of goring an ox and not a man, or of goring a man and not an ox:\r\nnay; of goring on the sabbath, and not on a working day. Their aim was\r\nto make the punishment depend on the proofs of the _design_ of the\r\nbeast that did the injury; but this attempt evidently led them to\r\ndistinctions much too subtile and obscure. Thus some rabbins say that\r\nthe morning prayer of the _Shemáh_ must be read at the time they can\r\ndistinguish _blue_ from _white_; but another, more indulgent, insists it\r\nmay be when we can distinguish _blue_ from _green_! which latter colours\r\nare so near akin as to require a stronger light. With the same\r\nremarkable acuteness in distinguishing things, is their law respecting\r\nnot touching fire on the Sabbath. Among those which are specified in\r\nthis constitution, the rabbins allow the minister to look over young\r\nchildren by lamp-light, but he shall not read himself. The minister is\r\nforbidden to _read_ by lamp-light, lest he should trim his lamp; but he\r\nmay direct the children where they should read, because that is quickly\r\ndone, and there would be no danger of his trimming his lamp in their\r\npresence, or suffering any of them to do it in his. All these\r\nregulations, which some may conceive as minute and frivolous, show a\r\ngreat intimacy with the human heart, and a spirit of profound\r\nobservation which had been capable of achieving great purposes.\r\n\r\nThe owner of an innocent beast only pays half the costs for the mischief\r\nincurred. Man is always convict, and for all mischief he does he must\r\npay full costs. However there are casual damages,--as when a man pours\r\nwater accidentally on another man; or makes a thorn-hedge which annoys\r\nhis neighbour; or falling down, and another by stumbling on him incurs\r\nharm: how such compensations are to be made. He that has a vessel of\r\nanother's in keeping, and removes it, but in the removal breaks it, must\r\nswear to his own integrity; i.e., that he had no design to break it. All\r\noffensive or noisy trades were to be carried on at a certain distance\r\nfrom a town. Where there is an estate, the sons inherit, and the\r\ndaughters are maintained; but if there is not enough for all, the\r\ndaughters are maintained, and the sons must get their living as they\r\ncan, or even beg. The contrary to this excellent ordination has been\r\nobserved in Europe.\r\n\r\nThese few titles may enable the reader to form a general notion of the\r\nseveral subjects on which the Mishna treats. The Gemara or Commentary is\r\noften overloaded with ineptitudes and ridiculous subtilties. For\r\ninstance, in the article of \"Negative Oaths.\" If a man swears he will\r\neat no bread, and does eat all sorts of bread, in that case the perjury\r\nis but one; but if he swears that he will eat neither barley, nor\r\nwheaten, nor rye-bread, the perjury is multiplied as he multiplies his\r\neating of the several sorts.--Again, the Pharisees and the Sadducees had\r\nstrong differences about touching the holy writings with their hands.\r\nThe doctors ordained that whoever touched the book of the law must not\r\neat of the truma (first fruits of the wrought produce of the ground),\r\ntill they had washed their hands. The reason they gave was this. In\r\ntimes of persecution, they used to hide those sacred books in secret\r\nplaces, and good men would lay them out of the way when they had done\r\nreading them. It was possible, then, that these rolls of the law might\r\nbe gnawed by _mice_. The hands then that touched these books when they\r\ntook them out of the places where they had laid them up, were supposed\r\nto be unclean, so far as to disable them from eating the truma till they\r\nwere washed. On that account they made this a general rule, that if any\r\npart of the _Bible_ (except _Ecclesiastes_, because that excellent book\r\ntheir sagacity accounted less holy than the rest) or their phylacteries,\r\nor the strings of their phylacteries, were touched by one who had a\r\nright to eat the truma, he might not eat it till he had washed his\r\nhands. An evidence of that superstitious trifling, for which the\r\nPharisees and the later Rabbins have been so justly reprobated.\r\n\r\nThey were absurdly minute in the literal observance of their vows, and\r\nas shamefully subtile in their artful evasion of them. The Pharisees\r\ncould be easy enough to themselves when convenient, and always as hard\r\nand unrelenting as possible to all others. They quibbled, and dissolved\r\ntheir vows, with experienced casuistry. Jesus reproaches the Pharisees\r\nin Matthew xv. and Mark vii. for flagrantly violating the fifth\r\ncommandment, by allowing the vow of a son, perhaps made in hasty anger,\r\nits full force, when he had sworn that his father should never be the\r\nbetter for him, or anything he had, and by which an indigent father\r\nmight be suffered to starve. There is an express case to this purpose in\r\nthe Mishna, in the title of _Vows_. The reader may be amused by the\r\nstory:--A man made a vow that his _father should not profit by him_.\r\nThis man afterwards made a wedding-feast for his son, and wishes his\r\nfather should be present; but he cannot invite him, because he is tied\r\nup by his vow. He invented this expedient:--He makes a gift of the court\r\nin which the feast was to be kept, and of the feast itself, to a third\r\nperson in trust, that his father should be invited by that third person,\r\nwith the other company whom he at first designed. This third person then\r\nsays--If these things you thus have given me are mine, I will dedicate\r\nthem to God, and then none of you can be the better for them. The son\r\nreplied--I did not give them to you that you should consecrate them.\r\nThen the third man said--Yours was no donation, only you were willing to\r\neat and drink with your father. Thus, says R. Juda, they dissolved each\r\nother's intentions; and when the case came before the rabbins, they\r\ndecreed that a gift which may not be consecrated by the person to whom\r\nit is given is not a gift.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the Talmud exhibits a subtile mode of\r\nreasoning, which the Jews adopted when the learned of Rome sought to\r\npersuade them to conform to their idolatry. It forms an entire Mishna,\r\nentitled _Sedir Nezikin_, Avoda Zara, iv. 7. on idolatrous worship,\r\ntranslated by Wotton.\r\n\r\n\"Some Roman senators examined the Jews in this manner:--If God hath no\r\ndelight in the worship of idols, why did he not destroy them? The Jews\r\nmade answer--If men had worshipped only things of which the world had\r\nhad no need, he would have destroyed the object of their worship; but\r\nthey also worship the sun and moon, stars and planets; and then he must\r\nhave destroyed his world for the sake of these deluded men. But still,\r\nsaid the Romans, why does not God destroy the things which the world\r\ndoes not want, and leave those things which the world cannot be without?\r\nBecause, replied the Jews, this would strengthen the hands of such as\r\nworship these necessary things, who would then say--Ye allow now that\r\nthese are gods, since they are not destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBINICAL STORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding article furnishes some of the more serious investigations\r\nto be found in the Talmud. Its levities may amuse. I leave untouched the\r\ngross obscenities and immoral decisions. The Talmud contains a vast\r\ncollection of stories, apologues, and jests; many display a vein of\r\npleasantry, and at times have a wildness of invention, which\r\nsufficiently mark the features of an eastern parent. Many extravagantly\r\npuerile were designed merely to recreate their young students. When a\r\nrabbin was asked the reason of so much nonsense, he replied that the\r\nancients had a custom of introducing music in their lectures, which\r\naccompaniment made them more agreeable; but that not having musical\r\ninstruments in the schools, the rabbins invented these strange stories\r\nto arouse attention. This was ingeniously said; but they make miserable\r\nwork when they pretend to give mystical interpretations to pure\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\nIn 1711, a German professor of the Oriental languages, Dr. Eisenmenger,\r\npublished in two large volumes quarto, his \"Judaism Discovered,\" a\r\nponderous labour, of which the scope was to ridicule the Jewish\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nI shall give a dangerous adventure into which King David was drawn by\r\nthe devil. The king one day hunting, Satan appeared before him in the\r\nlikeness of a roe. David discharged an arrow at him, but missed his aim.\r\nHe pursued the feigned roe into the land of the Philistines. Ishbi, the\r\nbrother of Goliath, instantly recognised the king as him who had slain\r\nthat giant. He bound him, and bending him neck and heels, laid him under\r\na wine-press in order to press him to death. A miracle saves David. The\r\nearth beneath him became soft, and Ishbi could not press wine out of\r\nhim. That evening in the Jewish congregation a dove, whose wings were\r\ncovered with silver, appeared in great perplexity; and evidently\r\nsignified the king of Israel was in trouble. Abishai, one of the king's\r\ncounsellors, inquiring for the king, and finding him absent, is at a\r\nloss to proceed, for according to the Mishna, no one may ride on the\r\nking's horse, nor sit upon his throne, nor use his sceptre. The school\r\nof the rabbins, however, allowed these things in time of danger. On this\r\nAbishai vaults on David's horse, and (with an Oriental metaphor) the\r\nland of the Philistines leaped to him instantly! Arrived at Ishbi's\r\nhouse, he beholds his mother Orpa spinning. Perceiving the Israelite,\r\nshe snatched up her spinning-wheel and threw it at him, to kill him; but\r\nnot hitting him, she desired him to bring the spinning-wheel to her. He\r\ndid not do this exactly, but returned it to her in such a way that she\r\nnever asked any more for her spinning-wheel. When Ishbi saw this, and\r\nrecollecting that David, though tied up neck and heels, was still under\r\nthe wine-press, he cried out. \"There are now two who will destroy me!\"\r\nSo he threw David high up into the air, and stuck his spear into the\r\nground, imagining that David would fall upon it and perish. But Abishai\r\npronounced the magical name, which the Talmudists frequently make use\r\nof, and it caused David to hover between earth and heaven, so that he\r\nfell not down! Both at length unite against Ishbi, and observing that\r\ntwo young lions should kill one lion, find no difficulty in getting rid\r\nof the brother of Goliath.\r\n\r\nOf Solomon, another favourite hero of the Talmudists, a fine Arabian\r\nstory is told. This king was an adept in necromancy, and a male and a\r\nfemale devil were always in waiting for an emergency. It is observable,\r\nthat the Arabians, who have many stories concerning Solomon, always\r\ndescribe him as a magician. His adventures with Aschmedai, the prince of\r\ndevils, are numerous; and they both (the king and the devil) served one\r\nanother many a slippery trick. One of the most remarkable is when\r\nAschmedai, who was prisoner to Solomon, the king having contrived to\r\npossess himself of the devil's seal-ring, and chained him, one day\r\noffered to answer an unholy question put to him by Solomon, provided he\r\nreturned him his seal-ring and loosened his chain. The impertinent\r\ncuriosity of Solomon induced him to commit this folly. Instantly\r\nAschmedai swallowed the monarch; and stretching out his wings up to the\r\nfirmament of heaven, one of his feet remaining on the earth, he spit out\r\nSolomon four hundred leagues from him. This was done so privately, that\r\nno one knew anything of the matter. Aschmedai then assumed the likeness\r\nof Solomon, and sat on his throne. From that hour did Solomon say,\r\n\"_This_ then is the reward of all my labour,\" according to\r\nEcclesiasticus i. 3; which _this_ means, one rabbin says, his\r\nwalking-staff; and another insists was his ragged coat. For Solomon went\r\na begging from door to door; and wherever he came he uttered these\r\nwords; \"I, the preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.\" At length\r\ncoming before the council, and still repeating these remarkable words,\r\nwithout addition or variation, the rabbins said, \"This means something:\r\nfor a fool is not constant in his tale!\" They asked the chamberlain, if\r\nthe king frequently saw him? and he replied to them, No! Then they sent\r\nto the queens, to ask if the king came into their apartments? and they\r\nanswered, Yes! The rabbins then sent them a message to take notice of\r\nhis feet; for the feet of devils are like the feet of cocks. The queens\r\nacquainted them that his majesty always came in slippers, but forced\r\nthem to embrace at times forbidden by the law. He had attempted to lie\r\nwith his mother Bathsheba, whom he had almost torn to pieces. At this\r\nthe rabbins assembled in great haste, and taking the beggar with them,\r\nthey gave him the ring and the chain in which the great magical name was\r\nengraven, and led him to the palace. Asehmedai was sitting on the throne\r\nas the real Solomon entered; but instantly he shrieked and flew away.\r\nYet to his last day was Solomon afraid of the prince of devils, and had\r\nhis bed guarded by the valiant men of Israel, as is written in Cant.\r\niii. 7, 8.\r\n\r\nThey frequently display much humour in their inventions, as in the\r\nfollowing account of the manners and morals of an infamous town, which\r\nmocked at all justice. There were in Sodom four judges, who were liars,\r\nand deriders of justice. When any one had struck his neighbour's wife,\r\nand caused her to miscarry, these judges thus counselled the\r\nhusband:--\"Give her to the offender, that he may get her with child for\r\nthee.\" When any one had cut off an ear of his neighbour's ass, they said\r\nto the owner--\"Let him have the ass till the ear is grown again, that it\r\nmay be returned to thee as thou wishest.\" When any one had wounded his\r\nneighbour, they told the wounded man to \"give him a fee for letting him\r\nblood.\" A toll was exacted in passing a certain bridge; but if any one\r\nchose to wade through the water, or walk round about to save it, he was\r\ncondemned to a double toll. Eleasar, Abraham's servant, came thither,\r\nand they wounded him. When, before the judge, he was ordered to pay his\r\nfee for having his blood let, Eleasar flung a stone at the judge, and\r\nwounded him; on which the judge said to him--\"What meaneth this?\"\r\nEleasar replied--\"Give him who wounded me the fee that is due to myself\r\nfor wounding thee.\" The people of this town had a bedstead on which they\r\nlaid travellers who asked for rest. If any one was too long for it, they\r\ncut off his legs; and if he was shorter than the bedstead, they strained\r\nhim to its head and foot. When a beggar came to this town, every one\r\ngave him a penny, on which was inscribed the donor's name; but they\r\nwould sell him no bread, nor let him escape. When the beggar died from\r\nhunger, then they came about him, and each man took back his penny.\r\nThese stories are curious inventions of keen mockery and malice,\r\nseasoned with humour. It is said some of the famous decisions of Sancho\r\nPanza are to be found in the Talmud.\r\n\r\nAbraham is said to have been jealous of his wives, and built an\r\nenchanted city for them. He built an iron city and put them in. The\r\nwalls were so high and dark, the sun could not be seen in it. He gave\r\nthem a bowl full of pearls and jewels, which sent forth a light in this\r\ndark city equal to the sun. Noah, it seems, when in the ark, had no\r\nother light than jewels and pearls. Abraham, in travelling to Egypt,\r\nbrought with him a chest. At the custom-house the officers exacted the\r\nduties. Abraham would have readily paid, but desired they would not open\r\nthe chest. They first insisted on the duty for clothes, which Abraham\r\nconsented to pay; but then they thought, by his ready acquiescence, that\r\nit might be gold. Abraham consents to pay for gold. They now suspected\r\nit might be silk. Abraham was willing to pay for silk, or more costly\r\npearls; and Abraham generously consented to pay as if the chest\r\ncontained the most valuable of things. It was then they resolved to open\r\nand examine the chest; and, behold, as soon as that chest was opened,\r\nthat great lustre of human beauty broke out which made such a noise in\r\nthe land of Egypt; it was Sarah herself! The jealous Abraham, to conceal\r\nher beauty, had locked her up in this chest.\r\n\r\nThe whole creation in these rabbinical fancies is strangely gigantic and\r\nvast. The works of eastern nations are full of these descriptions; and\r\nHesiod's Theogony, and Milton's battles of angels, are puny in\r\ncomparison with these rabbinical heroes, or rabbinical things. Mountains\r\nare hurled, with all their woods, with great ease, and creatures start\r\ninto existence too terrible for our conceptions. The winged monster in\r\nthe \"Arabian Nights,\" called the Roc, is evidently one of the creatures\r\nof rabbinical fancy; it would sometimes, when very hungry, seize and fly\r\naway with an elephant. Captain Cook found a bird's nest in an island\r\nnear New Holland, built with sticks on the ground, six-and-twenty feet\r\nin circumference, and near three feet in height. But of the rabbinical\r\nbirds, fish, and animals, it is not probable any circumnavigator will\r\never trace even the slightest vestige or resemblance.\r\n\r\nOne of their birds, when it spreads its wings, blots out the sun. An egg\r\nfrom another fell out of its nest, and the white thereof broke and glued\r\nabout three hundred cedar-trees, and overflowed a village. One of them\r\nstands up to the lower joint of the leg in a river, and some mariners,\r\nimagining the water was not deep, were hastening to bathe, when a voice\r\nfrom heaven said--\"Step not in there, for seven years ago there a\r\ncarpenter dropped his axe, and it hath not yet reached the bottom.\"\r\n\r\nThe following passage, concerning fat geese, is perfectly in the style\r\nof these rabbins:--\"A rabbin once saw in a desert a flock of geese so\r\nfat that their feathers fell off, and the rivers flowed in fat. Then\r\nsaid I to them, shall we have part of you in the other world when the\r\nMessiah shall come? And one of them lifted up a wing, and another a leg,\r\nto signify these parts we should have. We should otherwise have had all\r\nparts of these geese; but we Israelites shall be called to an account\r\ntouching these fat geese, because their sufferings are owing to us. It\r\nis our iniquities that have delayed the coming of the Messiah; and these\r\ngeese suffer greatly by reason of their excessive fat, which daily and\r\ndaily increases, and will increase till the Messiah comes!\"\r\n\r\nWhat the manna was which fell in the wilderness, has often been\r\ndisputed, and still is disputable; it was sufficient for the rabbins to\r\nhave found in the Bible that the taste of it was \"as a wafer made with\r\nhoney,\" to have raised their fancy to its pitch. They declare it was\r\n\"like oil to children, honey to old men, and cakes to middle age.\" It\r\nhad every kind of taste except that of cucumbers, melons, garlic, and\r\nonions, and leeks, for these were those Egyptian roots which the\r\nIsraelites so much regretted to have lost. This manna had, however, the\r\nquality to accommodate itself to the palate of those who did not murmur\r\nin the wilderness; and to these it became fish, flesh, or fowl.\r\n\r\nThe rabbins never advance an absurdity without quoting a text in\r\nScripture; and to substantiate this fact they quote Deut. ii. 7, where\r\nit is said, \"Through this great wilderness these forty years the Lord\r\nthy God hath been with thee, and _thou hast lacked nothing_!\" St. Austin\r\nrepeats this explanation of the Rabbins, that the faithful found in this\r\nmanna the taste of their favourite food! However, the Israelites could\r\nnot have found all these benefits, as the rabbins tell us; for in\r\nNumbers xi. 6, they exclaim, \"There is _nothing at all besides this\r\nmanna_ before our eyes!\" They had just said that they remembered the\r\nmelons, cucumbers, &c., which they had eaten of so freely in Egypt. One\r\nof the hyperboles of the rabbins is, that the manna fell in such\r\nmountains, that the kings of the east and the west beheld them; which\r\nthey found on a passage in the 23rd Psalm; \"Thou preparest a table\r\nbefore me in the presence of mine enemies!\" These may serve as specimens\r\nof the forced interpretations on which their grotesque fables are\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nTheir detestation of Titus, their great conqueror, appears by the\r\nfollowing wild invention. After having narrated certain things too\r\nshameful to read, of a prince whom Josephus describes in far different\r\ncolours, they tell us that on sea Titus tauntingly observed, in a great\r\nstorm, that the God of the Jews was only powerful on the water, and\r\nthat, therefore, he had succeeded in drowning Pharaoh and Sisera. \"Had\r\nhe been strong, he would have waged war with me in Jerusalem.\" On\r\nuttering this blasphemy, a voice from heaven said, \"Wicked man! I have a\r\nlittle creature in the world which shall wage war with thee!\" When Titus\r\nlanded, a gnat entered his nostrils, and for seven years together made\r\nholes in his brains. When his skull was opened, the gnat was found to be\r\nas large as a pigeon: the mouth of the gnat was of copper, and the claws\r\nof iron. A collection which has recently appeared of these Talmudical\r\nstories has not been executed with any felicity of selection. That there\r\nare, however, some beautiful inventions in the Talmud, I refer to the\r\nstory of Solomon and Sheba, in the present volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CUSTOM OF SALUTING AFTER SNEEZING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this custom, so universally prevalent, originated in\r\nsome ancient superstition; it seems to have excited inquiry among all\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\"Some Catholics,\" says Father Feyjoo, \"have attributed the origin of\r\nthis custom to the ordinance of a pope, Saint Gregory, who is said to\r\nhave instituted a short benediction to be used on such occasions, at a\r\ntime when, during a pestilence, the crisis was attended by _sneezing_,\r\nand in most cases followed by _death_.\"\r\n\r\nBut the rabbins, who have a story for everything, say, that before Jacob\r\nmen never sneezed but _once_, and then immediately _died_: they assure\r\nus that that patriarch was the first who died by natural disease; before\r\nhim all men died by sneezing; the memory of which was ordered to be\r\npreserved in _all nations_, by a command of every prince to his subjects\r\nto employ some salutary exclamation after the act of sneezing. But these\r\nare Talmudical dreams, and only serve to prove that so familiar a custom\r\nhas always excited inquiry.\r\n\r\nEven Aristotle has delivered some considerable nonsense on this custom;\r\nhe says it is an honourable acknowledgment of the seat of good sense and\r\ngenius--the head--to distinguish it from two other offensive eruptions\r\nof air, which are never accompanied by any benediction from the\r\nby-standers. The custom, at all events, existed long prior to Pope\r\nGregory. The lover in Apuleius, Gyton in Petronius, and allusions to it\r\nin Pliny, prove its antiquity; and a memoir of the French Academy\r\nnotices the practice in the New World, on the first discovery of\r\nAmerica. Everywhere man is saluted for sneezing.\r\n\r\nAn amusing account of the ceremonies which attend the _sneezing_ of a\r\nking of Monomotapa, shows what a national concern may be the sneeze of\r\ndespotism.--Those who are near his person, when this happens, salute him\r\nin so loud a tone, that persons in the ante-chamber hear it, and join in\r\nthe acclamation; in the adjoining apartments they do the same, till the\r\nnoise reaches the street, and becomes propagated throughout the city; so\r\nthat, at each sneeze of his majesty, results a most horrid cry from the\r\nsalutations of many thousands of his vassals.\r\n\r\nWhen the king of Sennaar sneezes, his courtiers immediately turn their\r\nbacks on him, and give a loud slap on their right thigh.\r\n\r\nWith the ancients sneezing was ominous;[42] from the _right_ it was\r\nconsidered auspicious; and Plutarch, in his Life of Themistocles, says,\r\nthat before a naval battle it was a sign of conquest! Catullus, in his\r\npleasing poem of Acmè and Septimus, makes this action from the deity of\r\nLove, from the _left_, the source of his fiction. The passage has been\r\nelegantly versified by a poetical friend, who finds authority that the\r\ngods sneezing on the _right_ in _heaven_, is supposed to come to us on\r\n_earth_ on the _left_.\r\n\r\n    Cupid _sneezing_ in his flight,\r\n    Once was heard upon the _right_,\r\n    Boding woe to lovers true;\r\n    But now upon the _left_ he flew,\r\n    And with sporting _sneeze_ divine,\r\n    Gave to joy the sacred sign.\r\n    Acmè bent her lovely face,\r\n    Flush'd with rapture's rosy grace,\r\n    And those eyes that swam in bliss,\r\n    Prest with many a breathing kiss;\r\n    Breathing, murmuring, soft, and low,\r\n    Thus might life for ever flow!\r\n    \"Love of my life, and life of love!\r\n    Cupid rules our fates above,\r\n    Ever let us vow to join\r\n    In homage at his happy shrine.\"\r\n    Cupid heard the lovers true,\r\n    Again upon the _left_ he flew,\r\n    And with sporting _sneeze_ divine,\r\n    Renew'd of joy the _sacred sign_!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Xenophon having addressed a speech to his soldiers, in\r\nwhich he declared he felt many reasons for a dependence on the favour of\r\nthe gods, had scarcely concluded his words when one of them emitted a\r\nloud sneeze. Xenophon at once declared this a spontaneous omen sent by\r\nJupiter as a sign that his protection was awarded them.\r\n\r\n    \"O, happy Bridegroom! thee a lucky sneeze\r\n    To Sparta welcom'd.\"--_Theocritus_, Idyll xviii.\r\n\r\n\"Prometheus was the first that wished well to the sneezer, when the man\r\nwhich he had made of clay fell into a fit of sternutation upon the\r\napproach of that celestial fire which he stole from the sun.\"--Ross's\r\n_Arcana Microcosmi_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBONAVENTURE DE PERIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA happy art in the relation of a story is, doubtless, a very agreeable\r\ntalent; it has obtained La Fontaine all the applause which his charming\r\n_naïveté_ deserves.\r\n\r\nOf \"_Bonaventure de Periers, Valet de Chambre de la Royne de Navarre_,\"\r\nthere are three little volumes of tales in prose, in the quaint or the\r\ncoarse pleasantry of that day. The following is not given as the best,\r\nbut as it introduces a novel etymology of a word in great use:--\r\n\r\n\"A student at law, who studied at Poitiers, had tolerably improved\r\nhimself in cases of equity; not that he was over-burthened with\r\nlearning; but his chief deficiency was a want of assurance and\r\nconfidence to display his knowledge. His father, passing by Poitiers,\r\nrecommended him to read aloud, and to render his memory more prompt by\r\ncontinued exercise. To obey the injunctions of his father, he determined\r\nto read at the _Ministery_. In order to obtain a certain quantity of\r\nassurance, he went every day into a garden, which was a very retired\r\nspot, being at a distance from any house, and where there grew a great\r\nnumber of fine large cabbages. Thus for a long time he pursued his\r\nstudies, and repeated his lectures to these cabbages, addressing them by\r\nthe title of _gentlemen_, and balancing his periods to them as if they\r\nhad composed an audience of scholars. After a fort-night or three weeks'\r\npreparation, he thought it was high time to take the _chair_; imagining\r\nthat he should be able to lecture his scholars as well as he had before\r\ndone his cabbages. He comes forward, he begins his oration--but before a\r\ndozen words his tongue freezes between his teeth! Confused, and hardly\r\nknowing where he was, all he could bring out was--_Domini, Ego bene\r\nvideo quod non eslis caules_; that is to say--for there are some who\r\nwill have everything in plain English--_Gentlemen, I now clearly see you\r\nare not cabbages!_ In the _garden_ he could conceive the _cabbages_ to\r\nbe _scholars_; but in the _chair_, he could not conceive the _scholars_\r\nto be _cabbages_.\"\r\n\r\nOn this story La Monnoye has a note, which gives a new origin to a\r\nfamiliar term.\r\n\r\n\"The hall of the School of Equity at Poitiers, where the institutes were\r\nread, was called _La Ministerie_. On which head Florimond de Remond\r\n(book vii. ch. 11), speaking of Albert Babinot, one of the first\r\ndisciples of Calvin, after having said he was called 'The _good man_,'\r\nadds, that because he had been a student of the institutes at this\r\n_Ministerie_ of Poitiers, Calvin and others styled him _Mr. Minister_;\r\nfrom whence, afterwards _Calvin_ took occasion to give the name of\r\nMINISTERS to the pastors of his church.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROTIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Life of Grotius shows the singular felicity of a man of letters and\r\na statesman, and how a student can pass his hours in the closest\r\nimprisonment. The gate of the prison has sometimes been the porch of\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nGrotius, studious from his infancy, had also received from Nature the\r\nfaculty of genius, and was so fortunate as to find in his father a tutor\r\nwho formed his early taste and his moral feelings. The younger Grotius,\r\nin imitation of Horace, has celebrated his gratitude in verse.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting circumstances in the life of this great man,\r\nwhich strongly marks his genius and fortitude, is displayed in the\r\nmanner in which he employed his time during his imprisonment. Other men,\r\ncondemned to exile and captivity, if they survive, despair; the man of\r\nletters may reckon those days as the sweetest of his life.\r\n\r\nWhen a prisoner at the Hague, he laboured on a Latin essay on the means\r\nof terminating religious disputes, which occasion so many infelicities\r\nin the state, in the church, and in families; when he was carried to\r\nLouvenstein, he resumed his law studies, which other employments had\r\ninterrupted. He gave a portion of his time to moral philosophy, which\r\nengaged him to translate the maxims of the ancient poets, collected by\r\nStobæus, and the fragments of Menander and Philemon.\r\n\r\nEvery Sunday was devoted to the Scriptures, and to his Commentaries on\r\nthe New Testament. In the course of the work he fell ill; but as soon as\r\nhe recovered his health, he composed his treatise, in Dutch verse, on\r\nthe Truth of the Christian Religion. Sacred and profane authors occupied\r\nhim alternately. His only mode of refreshing his mind was to pass from\r\none work to another. He sent to Vossius his observations on the\r\nTragedies of Seneca. He wrote several other works--particularly a little\r\nCatechism, in verse, for his daughter Cornelia--and collected materials\r\nto form his Apology. Although he produced thus abundantly, his\r\nconfinement was not more than two years. We may well exclaim here, that\r\nthe mind of Grotius had never been imprisoned.\r\n\r\nTo these various labours we may add an extensive correspondence he held\r\nwith the learned; his letters were often so many treatises, and there is\r\na printed collection amounting to two thousand. Grotius had notes ready\r\nfor every classical author of antiquity, whenever a new edition was\r\nprepared; an account of his plans and his performances might furnish a\r\nvolume of themselves; yet he never published in haste, and was fond of\r\nrevising them. We must recollect, notwithstanding such uninterrupted\r\nliterary avocations, his hours were frequently devoted to the public\r\nfunctions of an ambassador:--\"I only reserve for my studies the time\r\nwhich other ministers give to their pleasures, to conversations often\r\nuseless, and to visits sometimes unnecessary.\" Such is the language of\r\nthis great man!\r\n\r\nI have seen this great student censured for neglecting his official\r\nduties; but, to decide on this accusation, it would be necessary to know\r\nthe character of his accuser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOBLEMEN TURNED CRITICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI offer to the contemplation of those unfortunate mortals who are\r\nnecessitated to undergo the criticisms of _lords_, this pair of\r\nanecdotes:--\r\n\r\nSoderini, the Gonfalonière of Florence, having had a statue made by the\r\ngreat _Michael Angelo_, when it was finished, came to inspect it; and\r\nhaving for some time sagaciously considered it, poring now on the face,\r\nthen on the arms, the knees, the form of the leg, and at length on the\r\nfoot itself; the statue being of such perfect beauty, he found himself\r\nat a loss to display his powers of criticism, only by lavishing his\r\npraise. But only to praise might appear as if there had been an\r\nobtuseness in the keenness of his criticism. He trembled to find a\r\nfault, but a fault must be found. At length he ventured to mutter\r\nsomething concerning the nose--it might, he thought, be something more\r\nGrecian. _Angelo_ differed from his Grace, but he said he would attempt\r\nto gratify his taste. He took up his chisel, and concealed some marble\r\ndust in his hand; feigning to re-touch the part, he adroitly let fall\r\nsome of the dust he held concealed. The Cardinal observing it as it\r\nfell, transported at the idea of his critical acumen, exclaimed--\"Ah,\r\n_Angelo_, you have now given an inimitable grace!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pope was first introduced to read his Iliad to Lord Halifax, the\r\nnoble critic did not venture to be dissatisfied with so perfect a\r\ncomposition; but, like the cardinal, this passage, and that word, this\r\nturn, and that expression, formed the broken cant of his criticisms. The\r\nhonest poet was stung with vexation; for, in general, the parts at which\r\nhis lordship hesitated were those with which he was most satisfied. As\r\nhe returned home with Sir Samuel Garth, he revealed to him the anxiety\r\nof his mind. \"Oh,\" replied Garth, laughing, \"you are not so well\r\nacquainted with his lordship as myself; he must criticize. At your next\r\nvisit, read to him those very passages as they now stand; tell him that\r\nyou have recollected his criticisms; and I'll warrant you of his\r\napprobation of them. This is what I have done a hundred times myself.\"\r\n_Pope_ made use of this stratagem; it took, like the marble dust of\r\n_Angelo_; and my lord, like the cardinal, exclaimed--\"Dear _Pope_, they\r\nare now inimitable!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY IMPOSTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome authors have practised singular impositions on the public.\r\nVarillas, the French historian, enjoyed for some time a great reputation\r\nin his own country for his historical compositions; but when they became\r\nmore known, the scholars of other countries destroyed the reputation\r\nwhich he had unjustly acquired. His continual professions of sincerity\r\nprejudiced many in his favour, and made him pass for a writer who had\r\npenetrated into the inmost recesses of the cabinet; but the public were\r\nat length undeceived, and were convinced that the historical anecdotes\r\nwhich Varillas put off for authentic facts had no foundation, being\r\nwholly his own inventions--though he endeavoured to make them pass for\r\nrealities by affected citations of titles, instructions, letters,\r\nmemoirs, and relations, all of them imaginary! He had read almost\r\neverything historical, printed and manuscript; but his fertile political\r\nimagination gave his conjectures as facts, while he quoted at random his\r\npretended authorities. Burnet's book against Varillas is a curious\r\nlittle volume.[43]\r\n\r\nGemelli Carreri, a Neapolitan gentleman, for many years never quitted\r\nhis chamber; confined by a tedious indisposition, he amused himself with\r\nwriting a _Voyage round the World_; giving characters of men, and\r\ndescriptions of countries, as if he had really visited them: and his\r\nvolumes are still very interesting. I preserve this anecdote as it has\r\nlong come down to us; but Carreri, it has been recently ascertained, met\r\nthe fate of Bruce--for he had visited the places he has described;\r\nHumboldt and Clavigero have confirmed his local knowledge of Mexico and\r\nof China, and found his book useful and veracious. Du Halde, who has\r\nwritten so voluminous an account of China, compiled it from the Memoirs\r\nof the Missionaries, and never travelled ten leagues from Paris in his\r\nlife,--though he appears, by his writings, to be familiar with Chinese\r\nscenery.\r\n\r\nDamberger's Travels some years ago made a great sensation--and the\r\npublic were duped; they proved to be the ideal voyages of a member of\r\nthe German Grub-street, about his own garret. Too many of our \"Travels\"\r\nhave been manufactured to fill a certain size; and some which bear names\r\nof great authority were not written by the professed authors.\r\n\r\nThere is an excellent observation of an anonymous author:--\"_Writers_\r\nwho never visited foreign countries, and _travellers_ who have run\r\nthrough immense regions with fleeting pace, have given us long accounts\r\nof various countries and people; evidently collected from the idle\r\nreports and absurd traditions of the ignorant vulgar, from whom only\r\nthey could have received those relations which we see accumulated with\r\nsuch undiscerning credulity.\"\r\n\r\nSome authors have practised the singular imposition of announcing a\r\nvariety of titles of works preparing for the press, but of which nothing\r\nbut the titles were ever written.\r\n\r\nPaschal, historiographer of France, had a reason for these ingenious\r\ninventions; he continually announced such titles, that his pension for\r\nwriting on the history of France might not be stopped. When he died, his\r\nhistorical labours did not exceed six pages!\r\n\r\nGregorio Leti is an historian of much the same stamp as Varillas. He\r\nwrote with great facility, and hunger generally quickened his pen. He\r\ntook everything too lightly; yet his works are sometimes looked into for\r\nmany anecdotes of English history not to be found elsewhere; and perhaps\r\nought not to have been there if truth had been consulted. His great aim\r\nwas always to make a book: he swells his volumes with digressions,\r\nintersperses many ridiculous stories, and applies all the repartees he\r\ncollected from old novel-writers to modern characters.\r\n\r\nSuch forgeries abound; the numerous \"Testaments Politiques\" of Colbert,\r\nMazarin, and other great ministers, were forgeries usually from the\r\nDutch press, as are many pretended political \"Memoirs.\"\r\n\r\nOf our old translations from the Greek and Latin authors, many were\r\ntaken from French versions.\r\n\r\nThe Travels, written in Hebrew, of Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela, of which we\r\nhave a curious translation, are, I believe, apocryphal. He describes a\r\njourney, which, if ever he took, it must have been with his night-cap\r\non; being a perfect dream! It is said that to inspirit and give\r\nimportance to his nation, he pretended that he had travelled to all the\r\nsynagogues in the East; he mentions places which he does not appear ever\r\nto have seen, and the different people he describes no one has known. He\r\ncalculates that he has found near eight hundred thousand Jews, of which\r\nabout half are independent, and not subjects of any Christian or Gentile\r\nsovereign. These fictitious travels have been a source of much trouble\r\nto the learned; particularly to those who in their zeal to authenticate\r\nthem followed the aërial footsteps of the Hyppogriffe of Rabbi Benjamin.\r\nHe affirms that the tomb of Ezekiel, with the library of the first and\r\nsecond temples, were to be seen in his time at a place on the banks of\r\nthe river Euphrates; Wesselius of Groningen, and many other literati,\r\ntravelled on purpose to Mesopotamia, to reach the tomb and examine the\r\nlibrary; but the fairy treasures were never to be seen, nor even heard\r\nof!\r\n\r\nThe first on the list of impudent impostors is Annius of Viterbo, a\r\nDominican, and master of the sacred palace under Alexander VI. He\r\npretended he had discovered the entire works of Sanchoniatho, Manetho,\r\nBerosus, and others, of which only fragments are remaining. He published\r\nseventeen books of antiquities! But not having any MSS. to produce,\r\nthough he declared he had found them buried in the earth, these literary\r\nfabrications occasioned great controversies; for the author died before\r\nhe made up his mind to a confession. At their first publication\r\nuniversal joy was diffused among the learned. Suspicion soon rose, and\r\ndetection followed. However, as the forger never would acknowledge\r\nhimself as such, it has been ingeniously conjectured that he himself was\r\nimposed on, rather than that he was the impostor; or, as in the case of\r\nChatterton, possibly all may not be fictitious. It has been said that a\r\ngreat volume in MS., anterior by two hundred years to the seventeen\r\nbooks of Annius, exists in the Bibliothèque Colbertine, in which these\r\npretended histories were to be read; but as Annius would never point out\r\nthe sources of his, the whole may be considered as a very wonderful\r\nimposture. I refer the reader to Tyrwhitt's Vindication of his Appendix\r\nto Rowley's or Chatterton's Poems, p. 140, for some curious\r\nobservations, and some facts of literary imposture.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary literary imposture was that of one Joseph Vella, who,\r\nin 1794, was an adventurer in Sicily, and pretended that he possessed\r\nseventeen of the lost books of Livy in Arabic: he had received this\r\nliterary treasure, he said, from a Frenchman, who had purloined it from\r\na shelf in St. Sophia's church at Constantinople. As many of the Greek\r\nand Roman classics have been translated by the Arabians, and many were\r\nfirst known in Europe in their Arabic dress, there was nothing\r\nimprobable in one part of his story. He was urged to publish these\r\nlong-desired books; and Lady Spencer, then in Italy, offered to defray\r\nthe expenses. He had the effrontery, by way of specimen, to edit an\r\nItalian translation of the sixtieth book, but that book took up no more\r\nthan one octavo page! A professor of Oriental literature in Prussia\r\nintroduced it in his work, never suspecting the fraud; it proved to be\r\nnothing more than the epitome of Florus. He also gave out that he\r\npossessed a code which he had picked up in the abbey of St. Martin,\r\ncontaining the ancient history of Sicily in the Arabic period,\r\ncomprehending above two hundred years; and of which ages their own\r\nhistorians were entirely deficient in knowledge. Vella declared he had a\r\ngenuine official correspondence between the Arabian governors of Sicily\r\nand their superiors in Africa, from the first landing of the Arabians in\r\nthat island. Vella was now loaded with honours and pensions! It is true\r\nhe showed Arabic MSS., which, however, did not contain a syllable of\r\nwhat he said. He pretended he was in continual correspondence with\r\nfriends at Morocco and elsewhere. The King of Naples furnished him with\r\nmoney to assist his researches. Four volumes in quarto were at length\r\npublished! Vella had the adroitness to change the Arabic MSS. he\r\npossessed, which entirely related to Mahomet, to matters relative to\r\nSicily; he bestowed several weeks' labour to disfigure the whole,\r\naltering page for page, line for line, and word for word, but\r\ninterspersed numberless dots, strokes, and flourishes; so that when he\r\npublished a fac-simile, every one admired the learning of Vella, who\r\ncould translate what no one else could read. He complained he had lost\r\nan eye in this minute labour; and every one thought his pension ought to\r\nhave been increased. Everything prospered about him, except his eye,\r\nwhich some thought was not so bad neither. It was at length discovered\r\nby his blunders, &c., that the whole was a forgery: though it had now\r\nbeen patronised, translated, and extracted through Europe. When this MS.\r\nwas examined by an Orientalist, it was discovered to be nothing but a\r\nhistory of _Mahomet and his family_. Vella was condemned to\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish antiquary, Medina Conde, in order to favour the pretensions\r\nof the church in a great lawsuit, forged deeds and inscriptions, which\r\nhe buried in the ground, where he knew they would shortly be dug up.\r\nUpon their being found, he published engravings of them, and gave\r\nexplanations of their unknown characters, making them out to be so many\r\nauthentic proofs and evidences of the contested assumptions of the\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\nThe Morocco ambassador purchased of him a copper bracelet of Fatima,\r\nwhich Medina proved by the Arabic inscription and many certificates to\r\nbe genuine, and found among the ruins of the Alhambra, with other\r\ntreasures of its last king, who had hid them there in hope of better\r\ndays. This famous bracelet turned out afterwards to be the work of\r\nMedina's own hand, made out of an old brass candlestick!\r\n\r\nGeorge Psalmanazar, to whose labours we owe much of the great Universal\r\nHistory, exceeded in powers of deception any of the great impostors of\r\nlearning. His Island of Formosa was an illusion eminently bold,[44] and\r\nmaintained with as much felicity as erudition; and great must have been\r\nthat erudition which could form a pretended language and its grammar,\r\nand fertile the genius which could invent the history of an unknown\r\npeople: it is said that the deception was only satisfactorily\r\nascertained by his own penitential confession; he had defied and\r\nbaffled the most learned.[45] The literary impostor Lauder had much more\r\naudacity than ingenuity, and he died contemned by all the world.[46]\r\nIreland's \"Shakspeare\" served to show that commentators are not blessed,\r\nnecessarily, with an interior and unerring tact.[47] Genius and learning\r\nare ill directed in forming literary impositions, but at least they must\r\nbe distinguished from the fabrications of ordinary impostors.\r\n\r\nA singular forgery was practised on Captain Wilford by a learned Hindu,\r\nwho, to ingratiate himself and his studies with the too zealous and\r\npious European, contrived, among other attempts, to give the history of\r\nNoah and his three sons, in his \"Purana,\" under the designation of\r\nSatyavrata. Captain Wilford having _read_ the passage, transcribed it\r\nfor Sir William Jones, who translated it as a curious extract; the whole\r\nwas an interpolation by the dexterous introduction of a forged sheet,\r\ndiscoloured and prepared for the purpose of deception, and which, having\r\nserved his purpose for the moment, was afterwards withdrawn. As books in\r\nIndia are not bound, it is not difficult to introduce loose leaves. To\r\nconfirm his various impositions, this learned forger had the patience to\r\nwrite two voluminous sections, in which he connected all the legends\r\ntogether in the style of the _Puranas_, consisting of 12,000 lines. When\r\nCaptain Wilford resolved to collate the manuscript with others, the\r\nlearned Hindu began to disfigure his own manuscript, the captain's, and\r\nthose of the college, by erasing the name of the country and\r\nsubstituting that of Egypt. With as much pains, and with a more\r\nhonourable direction, our Hindu Lauder might have immortalized his\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nWe have authors who sold their names to be prefixed to works they never\r\nread; or, on the contrary, have prefixed the names of others to their\r\nown writings. Sir John Hill, once when he fell sick, owned to a friend\r\nthat he had over-fatigued himself with writing seven works at once! one\r\nof which was on architecture, and another on cookery! This hero once\r\ncontracted to translate Swammerdam's work on insects for fifty guineas.\r\nAfter the agreement with the bookseller, he recollected that he did not\r\nunderstand a word of the Dutch language! Nor did there exist a French\r\ntranslation! The work, however, was not the less done for this small\r\nobstacle. Sir John bargained with another translator for twenty-five\r\nguineas. The second translator was precisely in the same situation as\r\nthe first--as ignorant, though not so well paid as the knight. He\r\nrebargained with a third, who perfectly understood his original, for\r\ntwelve guineas! So that the translators who could not translate feasted\r\non venison and turtle, while the modest drudge, whose name never\r\nappeared to the world, broke in patience his daily bread! The craft of\r\nauthorship has many mysteries.[48] One of the great patriarchs and\r\nprimeval dealers in English literature was Robert Green, one of the most\r\nfacetious, profligate, and indefatigable of the Scribleri family. He\r\nlaid the foundation of a new dynasty of literary emperors. The first act\r\nby which he proved his claim to the throne of Grub-street has served as\r\na model to his numerous successors--it was an ambidextrous trick! Green\r\nsold his \"Orlando Furioso\" to two different theatres, and is among the\r\nfirst authors in English literary history who wrote as a _trader_;[49]\r\nor as crabbed Anthony Wood phrases it, in the language of celibacy and\r\ncynicism, \"he wrote to maintain his _wife_, and that high and loose\r\ncourse of living which _poets generally follow_.\" With a drop still\r\nsweeter, old Anthony describes Gayton, another worthy; \"he came up to\r\nLondon to live in a _shirking condition_, and wrote _trite things_\r\nmerely to get bread to sustain him and his _wife_.\"[50] The hermit\r\nAnthony seems to have had a mortal antipathy against the Eves of\r\nliterary men.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Burnet's little 12mo volume was printed at Amsterdam, \"in\r\nthe Warmoes-straet near the Dam,\" 1686, and compiled by him when living\r\nfor safety in Holland during the reign of James II. He particularly\r\nattacks Varillas' ninth book, which relates to England, and its false\r\nhistory of the Reformation, or rather \"his own imagination for true\r\nhistory.\" On the authority of Catholic students, he says \"the greatest\r\nnumber of the pieces he cited were to be found nowhere but in his own\r\nfancy.\" Burnet allows full latitude to an author for giving the best\r\ncolouring to his own views and that of his party--a latitude he\r\ncertainly always allowed to himself; but he justly censures the\r\nfalsifying, or rather inventing, of history; after Varillas' fashion.\r\n\"History,\" says Burnet, \"is a sort of trade, in which false coyn and\r\nfalse weights are more criminal than in other matters; because the\r\nerrour may go further and run longer, though their authors colour their\r\ncopper too slightly to make it keep its credit long.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: The volume was published in 8vo in 1704, as \"An Historical\r\nand Geographical Description of Formosa, an Island subject to the\r\nEmperor of Japan.\" It is dedicated to the Bishop of London, who is told\r\nthat \"the Europeans have such obscure and various notions of Japan, and\r\nespecially of our island Formosa, that they believe nothing for truth\r\nthat has been said of it.\" He accordingly narrates the political history\r\nof the place; the manners and customs of its inhabitants; their\r\nreligion, language, &c. A number of engravings illustrate the whole, and\r\ndepict the dresses of the people, their houses, temples, and ceremonies.\r\nA \"Formosan Alphabet\" is also given, and the Lord's Prayer, Apostles'\r\nCreed, and Ten Commandments, are \"translated\" into this imaginary\r\nlanguage. To keep up the imposition, he ate raw meat when dining with\r\nthe Secretary to the Royal Society, and Formosa appeared in the maps as\r\na real island, in the spot he had described as its locality.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Psalmanazar would never reveal the true history of his\r\nearly life, but acknowledged one of the southern provinces of France as\r\nthe place of his birth, about 1679. He received a fair education, became\r\nlecturer in a Jesuit college, then a tutor at Avignon; he afterwards led\r\na wandering life, subsisting on charity, and pretending to be an Irish\r\nstudent travelling to Rome for conscience sake. He soon found he would\r\nbe more successful if he personated a Pagan stranger, and hence he\r\ngradually concocted his tale of _Formosa_; inventing an alphabet, and\r\nperfecting his story, which was not fully matured before he had had a\r\nfew years' hard labour as a soldier in the Low Countries; where a Scotch\r\ngentleman introduced him to the notice of Dr. Compton, Bishop of London;\r\nwho patronised him, and invited him to England. He came, and to oblige\r\nthe booksellers compiled his _History of Formosa_, by the two editions\r\nof which he realized the noble sum of 22_l._ He ended in becoming a\r\nregular bookseller's hack, and so highly moral a character, that Dr.\r\nJohnson, who knew him well, declared he was \"the best man he had ever\r\nknown.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: William Lauder first began his literary impostures in the\r\n_Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1747, where he accused Milton of gross\r\nplagiarisms in his _Paradise Lost_, pretending that he had discovered\r\nthe prototypes of his best thoughts in other authors. This he did by\r\nabsolute invention, in one instance interpolating twenty verses of a\r\nLatin translation of Milton into the works of another author, and then\r\nproducing them with great virulence as a proof that Milton was a\r\nplagiarist. The falsehood of his pretended quotations was demonstrated\r\nby Dr. Douglas, Bishop of Salisbury, in 1751, but he returned to the\r\ncharge in 1754. His character and conduct became too bad to allow of his\r\ncontinued residence in England, and he died in Barbadoes, \"in universal\r\ncontempt,\" about 1771.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Ireland's famous forgeries began when, as a young man in a\r\nlawyer's office, he sought to imitate old deeds and letters in the name\r\nof Shakspeare and his friends, urged thereto by his father's great\r\nanxiety to discover some writings connected with the great bard. Such\r\nwas the enthusiasm with which they were received by men of great general\r\nknowledge, that Ireland persevered in fresh forgeries until an entire\r\nplay was \"discovered.\" It was a tragedy founded on early British\r\nhistory, and named _Vortigern_. It was produced at Kemble's Theatre, and\r\nwas damned. Ireland's downward course commenced from that night. He\r\nultimately published confessions of his frauds, and died very poor in\r\n1835.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Fielding, the novelist, in _The Author's Farce_, one of\r\nthose slight plays which he wrote so cleverly, has used this incident,\r\nprobably from his acquaintance with Hill's trick. He introduces his\r\nauthor trying to sell a translation of the _Æneid_, which the bookseller\r\nwill not purchase; but after some conversation offers him \"employ\" in\r\nthe house as a translator; he then is compelled to own himself \"not\r\nqualified,\" because he \"understands no language but his own.\" \"What! and\r\ntranslate _Virgil!_\" exclaims the astonished bookseller. The detected\r\nauthor answers despondingly, \"Alas! sir, I translated him out of\r\nDryden!\" The bookseller joyfully exclaims, \"Not qualified! If I was an\r\nEmperor, thou should'st be my Prime Minister! Thou art as well vers'd in\r\nthy trade as if thou had'st laboured in my garret these ten years!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDINAL RICHELIEU.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present anecdote concerning Cardinal Richelieu may serve to teach\r\nthe man of letters how he deals out criticisms to the _great_, when they\r\nask his opinion of manuscripts, be they in verse or prose.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal placed in a gallery of his palace the portraits of several\r\nillustrious men, and was desirous of composing the inscriptions under\r\nthe portraits. The one which he intended for Montluc, the marechal of\r\nFrance, was conceived in these terms: _Multa fecit, plura scripsit, vir\r\ntamen magnus fuit_. He showed it without mentioning the author to\r\nBourbon, the royal Greek professor, and asked his opinion concerning it.\r\nThe critic considered that the Latin was much in the style of the\r\nbreviary; and, had it concluded with an _allelujah_, it would serve for\r\nan _anthem_ to the _magnificat_. The cardinal agreed with the severity\r\nof his strictures, and even acknowledged the discernment of the\r\nprofessor; \"for,\" he said, \"it is really written by a priest.\" But\r\nhowever he might approve of Bourbon's critical powers, he punished\r\nwithout mercy his ingenuity. The pension his majesty had bestowed on him\r\nwas withheld the next year.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal was one of those ambitious men who foolishly attempt to\r\nrival every kind of genius; and seeing himself constantly disappointed,\r\nhe envied, with all the venom of rancour, those talents which are so\r\nfrequently the _all_ that men of genius possess.\r\n\r\nHe was jealous of Balzac's splendid reputation; and offered the elder\r\nHeinsius ten thousand crowns to write a criticism which should ridicule\r\nhis elaborate compositions. This Heinsius refused, because Salmasius\r\nthreatened to revenge Balzac on his _Herodes Infanticida_.\r\n\r\nHe attempted to rival the reputation of Corneille's \"Cid,\" by opposing\r\nto it one of the most ridiculous dramatic productions; it was the\r\nallegorical tragedy called \"Europe,\" in which the _minister_ had\r\ncongregated the four quarters of the world! Much political matter was\r\nthrown together, divided into scenes and acts. There are appended to it\r\nkeys of the dramatis personæ and of the allegories. In this tragedy\r\nFrancion represents France; Ibere, Spain; Parthenope, Naples, &c.; and\r\nthese have their attendants:--Lilian (alluding to the French lilies) is\r\nthe servant of Francion, while Hispale is the confidant of Ibere. But\r\nthe key to the allegories is much more copious:--Albione signifies\r\nEngland; _three knots of the hair of Austrasie_ mean the towns of\r\nClermont, Stenay, and Jamet, these places once belonging to Lorraine. _A\r\nbox of diamonds_ of Austrasie is the town of Nancy, belonging once to\r\nthe dukes of Lorraine. The _key_ of Ibere's great porch is Perpignan,\r\nwhich France took from Spain; and in this manner is this sublime tragedy\r\ncomposed! When he first sent it anonymously to the French Academy it was\r\nreprobated. He then tore it in a rage, and scattered it about his study.\r\nTowards evening, like another Medea lamenting over the members of her\r\nown children, he and his secretary passed the night in uniting the\r\nscattered limbs. He then ventured to avow himself; and having pretended\r\nto correct this incorrigible tragedy, the submissive Academy retracted\r\ntheir censures, but the public pronounced its melancholy fate on its\r\nfirst representation. This lamentable tragedy was intended to thwart\r\nCorneille's \"Cid.\" Enraged at its success, Richelieu even commanded the\r\nAcademy to publish a severe _critique_ of it, well known in French\r\nliterature. Boileau on this occasion has these two well-turned verses:--\r\n\r\n    \"En vain contre le Cid, un ministre se ligue;\r\n    Tout Paris, pour _Chimene_, a les yeux de _Rodrigue_.\"\r\n\r\n    \"To oppose the Cid, in vain the statesman tries;\r\n    All Paris, for _Chimene_, has _Roderick's_ eyes.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that, in consequence of the fall of this tragedy, the French\r\ncustom is derived of securing a number of friends to applaud their\r\npieces at their first representations. I find the following droll\r\nanecdote concerning this droll tragedy in Beauchamp's _Recherches sur le\r\nThéâtre_.\r\n\r\nThe minister, after the ill success of his tragedy, retired\r\nunaccompanied the same evening to his country-house at Ruel. He then\r\nsent for his favourite Desmaret, who was at supper with his friend\r\nPetit. Desmaret, conjecturing that the interview would be stormy, begged\r\nhis friend to accompany him.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said the Cardinal, as soon as he saw them, \"the French will\r\nnever possess a taste for what is lofty; they seem not to have relished\r\nmy tragedy.\"--\"My lord,\" answered Petit, \"it is not the fault of the\r\npiece, which is so admirable, but that of the _players_. Did not your\r\neminence perceive that not only they knew not their parts, but that they\r\nwere all _drunk_?\"--\"Really,\" replied the Cardinal, something pleased,\r\n\"I observed they acted it dreadfully ill.\"\r\n\r\nDesmaret and Petit returned to Paris, flew directly to the players to\r\nplan a _new mode_ of performance, which was to _secure_ a number of\r\nspectators; so that at the second representation bursts of applause were\r\nfrequently heard!\r\n\r\nRichelieu had another singular vanity, of closely imitating Cardinal\r\nXimenes. Pliny was not a more servile imitator of Cicero. Marville tells\r\nus that, like Ximenes, he placed himself at the head of an army; like\r\nhim, he degraded princes and nobles; and like him, rendered himself\r\nformidable to all Europe. And because Ximenes had established schools of\r\ntheology, Richelieu undertook likewise to raise into notice the schools\r\nof the Sorbonne. And, to conclude, as Ximenes had written several\r\ntheological treatises, our cardinal was also desirous of leaving\r\nposterity various polemical works. But his gallantries rendered him more\r\nridiculous. Always in ill health, this miserable lover and grave\r\ncardinal would, in a freak of love, dress himself with a red feather in\r\nhis cap and sword by his side. He was more hurt by an offensive nickname\r\ngiven him by the queen of Louis XIII., than even by the hiss of theatres\r\nand the critical condemnation of academies.\r\n\r\nCardinal Richelieu was assuredly a great political genius. Sir William\r\nTemple observes, that he instituted the French Academy to give\r\nemployment to the _wits_, and to hinder them from inspecting too\r\nnarrowly his politics and his administration. It is believed that the\r\nMarshal de Grammont lost an important battle by the orders of the\r\ncardinal; that in this critical conjuncture of affairs his majesty, who\r\nwas inclined to dismiss him, could not then absolutely do without him.\r\n\r\nVanity in this cardinal levelled a great genius. He who would attempt to\r\ndisplay universal excellence will be impelled to practise meanness, and\r\nto act follies which, if he has the least sensibility, must occasion him\r\nmany a pang and many a blush.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: The story is told in _The Defence of Coneycatching_, 1592,\r\nwhere he is said to have \"sold _Orlando Furioso_ to the Queen's players\r\nfor twenty nobles, and when they were in the country sold the same play\r\nto the Lord Admirall's men for as much more.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Edmund Gayton was born in 1609, was educated at Oxford,\r\nthen led the life of a literary drudge in London, where the best book he\r\nproduced was _Pleasant Notes upon Don Quixote_, in which are many\r\ncurious and diverting stories, and among the rest the original of\r\nPrior's _Ladle_. He ultimately retired to Oxford, and died there very\r\npoor, in a subordinate place in his college.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARISTOTLE AND PLATO.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo philosopher has been so much praised and censured as Aristotle: but\r\nhe had this advantage, of which some of the most eminent scholars have\r\nbeen deprived, that he enjoyed during his life a splendid reputation.\r\nPhilip of Macedon must have felt a strong conviction of his merit, when\r\nhe wrote to him, on the birth of Alexander:--\"I receive from the gods\r\nthis day a son; but I thank them not so much for the favour of his\r\nbirth, as his having come into the world at a time when you can have the\r\ncare of his education; and that through you he will be rendered worthy\r\nof being my son.\"\r\n\r\nDiogenes Laertius describes the person of the Stagyrite.--His eyes were\r\nsmall, his voice hoarse, and his legs lank. He stammered, was fond of a\r\nmagnificent dress, and wore costly rings. He had a mistress whom he\r\nloved passionately, and for whom he frequently acted inconsistently with\r\nthe philosophic character; a thing as common with philosophers as with\r\nother men. Aristotle had nothing of the austerity of the philosopher,\r\nthough his works are so austere: he was open, pleasant, and even\r\ncharming in his conversation; fiery and volatile in his pleasures;\r\nmagnificent in his dress. He is described as fierce, disdainful, and\r\nsarcastic. He joined to a taste for profound erudition, that of an\r\nelegant dissipation. His passion for luxury occasioned him such expenses\r\nwhen he was young, that he consumed all his property. Laertius has\r\npreserved the will of Aristotle, which is curious. The chief part turns\r\non the future welfare and marriage of his daughter. \"If, after my death,\r\nshe chooses to marry, the executors will be careful she marries no\r\nperson of an inferior rank. If she resides at Chalcis, she shall occupy\r\nthe apartment contiguous to the garden; if she chooses Stagyra, she\r\nshall reside in the house of my father, and my executors shall furnish\r\neither of those places she fixes on.\"\r\n\r\nAristotle had studied under the divine Plato; but the disciple and the\r\nmaster could not possibly agree in their doctrines: they were of\r\nopposite tastes and talents. Plato was the chief of the academic sect,\r\nand Aristotle of the peripatetic. Plato was simple, modest, frugal, and\r\nof austere manners; a good friend and a zealous citizen, but a\r\ntheoretical politician: a lover indeed of benevolence, and desirous of\r\ndiffusing it amongst men, but knowing little of them as we find them;\r\nhis \"Republic\" is as chimerical as Rousseau's ideas, or Sir Thomas\r\nMore's Utopia.\r\n\r\nRapin, the critic, has sketched an ingenious parallel of these two\r\ncelebrated philosophers:--\r\n\r\n\"The genius of Plato is more polished, and that of Aristotle more vast\r\nand profound. Plato has a lively and teeming imagination; fertile in\r\ninvention, in ideas, in expressions, and in figures; displaying a\r\nthousand turns, a thousand new colours, all agreeable to their subject;\r\nbut after all it is nothing more than imagination. Aristotle is hard and\r\ndry in all he says, but what he says is all reason, though it is\r\nexpressed drily: his diction, pure as it is, has something uncommonly\r\naustere; and his obscurities, natural or affected, disgust and fatigue\r\nhis readers. Plato is equally delicate in his thoughts and in his\r\nexpressions. Aristotle, though he may be more natural, has not any\r\ndelicacy: his style is simple and equal, but close and nervous; that of\r\nPlato is grand and elevated, but loose and diffuse. Plato always says\r\nmore than he should say: Aristotle never says enough, and leaves the\r\nreader always to think more than he says. The one surprises the mind,\r\nand charms it by a flowery and sparkling character: the other\r\nilluminates and instructs it by a just and solid method. Plato\r\ncommunicates something of genius, by the fecundity of his own; and\r\nAristotle something of judgment and reason, by that impression of good\r\nsense which appears in all he says. In a word, Plato frequently only\r\nthinks to express himself well: and Aristotle only thinks to think\r\njustly.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting anecdote is related of these philosophers--Aristotle\r\nbecame the rival of Plato. Literary disputes long subsisted betwixt\r\nthem. The disciple ridiculed his master, and the master treated\r\ncontemptuously his disciple. To make his superiority manifest, Aristotle\r\nwished for a regular disputation before an audience, where erudition and\r\nreason might prevail; but this satisfaction was denied.\r\n\r\nPlato was always surrounded by his scholars, who took a lively interest\r\nin his glory. Three of these he taught to rival Aristotle, and it became\r\ntheir mutual interest to depreciate his merits. Unfortunately one day\r\nPlato found himself in his school without these three favourite\r\nscholars. Aristotle flies to him--a crowd gathers and enters with him.\r\nThe idol whose oracles they wished to overturn was presented to them. He\r\nwas then a respectable old man, the weight of whose years had enfeebled\r\nhis memory. The combat was not long. Some rapid sophisms embarrassed\r\nPlato. He saw himself surrounded by the inevitable traps of the subtlest\r\nlogician. Vanquished, he reproached his ancient scholar by a beautiful\r\nfigure:--\"He has kicked against us as a colt against its mother.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after this humiliating adventure he ceased to give public lectures.\r\nAristotle remained master in the field of battle. He raised a school,\r\nand devoted himself to render it the most famous in Greece. But the\r\nthree favourite scholars of Plato, zealous to avenge the cause of their\r\nmaster, and to make amends for their imprudence in having quitted him,\r\narmed themselves against the usurper.--Xenocrates, the most ardent of\r\nthe three, attacked Aristotle, confounded the logician, and\r\nre-established Plato in all his rights. Since that time the academic and\r\nperipatetic sects, animated by the spirits of their several chiefs,\r\navowed an eternal hostility. In what manner his works have descended to\r\nus has been told in a preceding article, on _Destruction of Books_.\r\nAristotle having declaimed irreverently of the gods, and dreading the\r\nfate of Socrates, wished to retire from Athens. In a beautiful manner he\r\npointed out his successor. There were two rivals in his schools:\r\nMenedemus the Rhodian, and Theophrastus the Lesbian. Alluding delicately\r\nto his own critical situation, he told his assembled scholars that the\r\nwine he was accustomed to drink was injurious to him, and he desired\r\nthem to bring the wines of Rhodes and Lesbos. He tasted both, and\r\ndeclared they both did honour to their soil, each being excellent,\r\nthough differing in their quality;--the Rhodian wine is the strongest,\r\nbut the Lesbian is the sweetest, and that he himself preferred it. Thus\r\nhis ingenuity designated his favourite Theophrastus, the author of the\r\n\"Characters,\" for his successor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABELARD AND ELOISA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbelard, so famous for his writings and his amours with Eloisa, ranks\r\namongst the Heretics for opinions concerning the Trinity! His superior\r\ngenius probably made him appear so culpable in the eyes of his enemies.\r\nThe cabal formed against him disturbed the earlier part of his life with\r\na thousand persecutions, till at length they persuaded Bernard, his old\r\n_friend_, but who had now turned _saint_, that poor Abelard was what\r\ntheir malice described him to be. Bernard, inflamed against him,\r\ncondemned unheard the unfortunate scholar. But it is remarkable that the\r\nbook which was burnt as unorthodox, and as the composition of Abelard,\r\nwas in fact written by Peter Lombard, Bishop of Paris; a work which has\r\nsince been _canonised_ in the Sarbonne, and on which the scholastic\r\ntheology is founded. The objectionable passage is an illustration of the\r\n_Trinity_ by the nature of a _syllogism_!--\"As (says he) the three\r\npropositions of a syllogism form but one truth, so the _Father and Son_\r\nconstitute but _one essence_. The _major_ represents the _Father_, the\r\n_minor_ the _Son_, and the _conclusion_ the _Holy Ghost_!\" It is curious\r\nto add, that Bernard himself has explained this mystical union precisely\r\nin the same manner, and equally clear. \"The understanding,\" says this\r\nsaint, \"is the image of God. We find it consists of three parts: memory,\r\nintelligence, and will. To _memory_, we attribute all which we know,\r\nwithout cogitation; to _intelligence_, all truths we discover which have\r\nnot been deposited by memory. By _memory_, we resemble the _Father_; by\r\n_intelligence_, the _Son_; and by _will_, the _Holy Ghost_.\" Bernard's\r\nLib. de Animâ, cap. i. num. 6, quoted in the \"Mem. Secrètes de la\r\nRépublique des Lettres.\" We may add also, that because Abelard, in the\r\nwarmth of honest indignation, had reproved the monks of St. Denis, in\r\nFrance, and St. Gildas de Ruys, in Bretagne, for the horrid incontinence\r\nof their lives, they joined his enemies, and assisted to embitter the\r\nlife of this ingenious scholar, who perhaps was guilty of no other crime\r\nthan that of feeling too sensibly an attachment to one who not only\r\npossessed the enchanting attractions of the softer sex, but, what indeed\r\nis very unusual, a congeniality of disposition, and an enthusiasm of\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n    \"Is it, in heaven, a crime to love too well?\"\r\n\r\nIt appears by a letter of Peter de Cluny to Eloisa, that she had\r\nsolicited for Abelard's absolution. The abbot gave it to her. It runs\r\nthus:--\"Ego Petrus Cluniacensis Abbas, qui Petrum Abælardum in monachum\r\nCluniacensem recepi, et corpus ejus furtim delatum Heloissæ abbatissæ et\r\nmoniali Paracleti concessi, auctoritate omnipotentis Dei et omnium\r\nsanctorum absolvo eum pro officio ab omnibus peccatis suis.\"\r\n\r\nAn ancient chronicle of Tours records, that when they deposited the body\r\nof the Abbess Eloisa in the tomb of her lover, Peter Abelard, who had\r\nbeen there interred twenty years, this faithful husband raised his arms,\r\nstretched them, and closely embraced his beloved Eloisa. This poetic\r\nfiction was invented to sanctify, by a miracle, the frailties of their\r\nyouthful days. This is not wonderful;--but it is strange that Du Chesne,\r\nthe father of French history, not only relates this legendary tale of\r\nthe ancient chroniclers, but gives it as an incident well authenticated,\r\nand maintains its possibility by various other examples. Such fanciful\r\nincidents once not only embellished poetry, but enlivened history.\r\n\r\nBayle tells us that _billets doux_ and _amorous verses_ are two powerful\r\nmachines to employ in the assaults of love, particularly when the\r\npassionate songs the poetical lover composes are sung by himself. This\r\nsecret was well known to the elegant Abelard. Abelard so touched the\r\nsensible heart of Eloisa, and infused such fire into her frame, by\r\nemploying his _fine pen_, and his _fine voice_, that the poor woman\r\nnever recovered from the attack. She herself informs us that he\r\ndisplayed two qualities which are rarely found in philosophers, and by\r\nwhich he could instantly win the affections of the female;--he _wrote_\r\nand _sung_ finely. He composed _love-verses_ so beautiful, and _songs_\r\nso agreeable, as well for the _words_ as the _airs_, that all the world\r\ngot them by heart, and the name of his mistress was spread from province\r\nto province.\r\n\r\nWhat a gratification to the enthusiastic, the amorous, the vain Eloisa!\r\nof whom Lord Lyttleton, in his curious Life of Henry II., observes, that\r\nhad she not been compelled to read the fathers and the legends in a\r\nnunnery, and had been suffered to improve her genius by a continued\r\napplication to polite literature, from what appears in her letters, she\r\nwould have excelled any man of that age.\r\n\r\nEloisa, I suspect, however, would have proved but a very indifferent\r\npolemic; she seems to have had a certain delicacy in her manners which\r\nrather belongs to the _fine lady_. We cannot but smile at an observation\r\nof hers on the _Apostles_ which we find in her letters:--\"We read that\r\nthe _apostles_, even in the company of their Master, were so _rustic_\r\nand _ill-bred,_ that, regardless of common decorum, as they passed\r\nthrough the corn-fields they plucked the ears, and ate them like\r\nchildren. Nor did they wash their hands before they sat down to table.\r\nTo eat with unwashed hands, said our Saviour to those who were offended,\r\ndoth not defile a man.\"\r\n\r\nIt is on the misconception of the mild apologetical reply of Jesus,\r\nindeed, that religious fanatics have really considered, that, to be\r\ncareless of their dress, and not to free themselves from filth and\r\nslovenliness, is an act of piety; just as the late political fanatics,\r\nwho thought that republicanism consisted in the most offensive\r\nfilthiness. On this principle, that it is saint-like to go dirty, ragged\r\nand slovenly, says Bishop Lavington, in his \"Enthusiasm of the\r\nMethodists and Papists,\" how _piously_ did Whitfield take care of the\r\noutward man, who in his journals writes, \"My apparel was mean--thought\r\nit unbecoming a penitent to have _powdered hair_.--I wore _woollen\r\ngloves_, a _patched gown_, and _dirty shoes!_\"\r\n\r\nAfter an injury, not less cruel than humiliating, Abelard raises the\r\nschool of the Paraclete; with what enthusiasm is he followed to that\r\ndesert! His scholars in crowds hasten to their adored master; they cover\r\ntheir mud sheds with the branches of trees; they care not to sleep under\r\nbetter roofs, provided they remain by the side of their unfortunate\r\nmaster. How lively must have been their taste for study!--it formed\r\ntheir solitary passion, and the love of glory was gratified even in that\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nThe two reprehensible lines in Pope's Eloisa, too celebrated among\r\ncertain of its readers--\r\n\r\n    \"Not Cesar's empress would I deign to prove;\r\n    No,--make me mistress to the man I love!\"--\r\n\r\nare, however, found in her original letters. The author of that ancient\r\nwork, \"The Romaunt of the Rose,\" has given it thus _naïvely_; a specimen\r\nof the _natural_ style in those days:--\r\n\r\n    Si l'empereur, qui est a Rome,\r\n    Souhz qui doyvent etre tout homme,\r\n    Me daignoit prendre pour sa femme,\r\n    Et me faire du monde dame!\r\n    Si vouldroye-je mieux, dist-elle\r\n    Et Dieù en tesmoing en appelle,\r\n    Etre sa Putaine appellée\r\n    Qu'etre emperiere couronnée.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOGNOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very extraordinary physiognomical anecdote has been given by De la\r\nPlace, in his \"_Pièces Intéressantes et peu Connues_,\" vol. iv. p. 8.\r\n\r\nA friend assured him that he had seen a voluminous and secret\r\ncorrespondence which had been carried on between Louis XIV. and his\r\nfavourite physician, De la Chambre, on this science. The faith of the\r\nmonarch seems to have been great, and the purpose to which this\r\ncorrespondence tended was extraordinary indeed, and perhaps scarcely\r\ncredible. Who will believe that Louis XIV. was so convinced of that\r\ntalent which De la Chambre attributed to himself, of deciding merely by\r\nthe physiognomy of persons, not only on the real bent of their\r\ncharacter, but to what employment they were adapted, that the king\r\nentered into a _secret correspondence_ to obtain the critical notices of\r\nhis _physiognomist?_ That Louis XIV. should have pursued this system,\r\nundetected by his own courtiers, is also singular; but it appears, by\r\nthis correspondence, that this art positively swayed him in his choice\r\nof officers and favourites. On one of the backs of these letters De la\r\nChambre had written, \"If I die before his majesty, he will incur great\r\nrisk of making many an unfortunate choice!\"\r\n\r\nThis collection of physiognomical correspondence, if it does really\r\nexist, would form a curious publication; we have heard nothing of it! De\r\nla Chambre was an enthusiastic physiognomist, as appears by his works;\r\n\"The Characters of the Passions,\" four volumes in quarto; \"The Art of\r\nKnowing Mankind;\" and \"The Knowledge of Animals.\" Lavater quotes his\r\n\"Vote and Interest,\" in favour of his favourite science. It is, however,\r\ncurious to add, that Philip Earl of Pembroke, under James I., had formed\r\na particular collection of portraits, with a view to physiognomical\r\nstudies. According to Evelyn on Medals, p. 302, such was his sagacity in\r\ndiscovering the characters and dispositions of men by their\r\ncountenances, that James I. made no little use of his extraordinary\r\ntalent on _the first arrival of ambassadors at court_.\r\n\r\nThe following physiological definition of PHYSIOGNOMY is extracted from\r\na publication by Dr. Gwither, of the year 1604, which, dropping his\r\nhistory of \"The Animal Spirits,\" is curious:--\r\n\r\n\"Soft wax cannot receive more various and numerous impressions than are\r\nimprinted on a man's face by _objects_ moving his affections: and not\r\nonly the _objects_ themselves have this power, but also the very\r\n_images_ or _ideas_; that is to say, anything that puts the animal\r\nspirits into the same motion that the _object_ present did, will have\r\nthe same effect with the object. To prove the first, let one observe a\r\nman's face looking on a pitiful object, then a ridiculous, then a\r\nstrange, then on a terrible or dangerous object, and so forth. For the\r\nsecond, that _ideas_ have the same effect with the _object_, dreams\r\nconfirm too often.\r\n\r\n\"The manner I conceive to be thus:--the animal spirits, moved in the\r\nsensory by an object, continue their motion to the brain; whence the\r\nmotion is propagated to this or that particular part of the body, as is\r\nmost suitable to the design of its creation; having first made an\r\nalteration in the _face_ by its nerves, especially by the _pathetic_ and\r\n_oculorum motorii_ actuating its many muscles, as the dial-plate to that\r\nstupendous piece of clock-work which shows what is to be expected next\r\nfrom the striking part; not that I think the motion of the spirits in\r\nthe sensory continued by the impression of the object all the way, as\r\nfrom a finger to the foot; I know it too weak, though the tenseness of\r\nthe nerves favours it. But I conceive it done in the medulla of the\r\nbrain, where is the common stock of spirits; as in an organ, whose\r\npipes being uncovered, the air rushes into them; but the keys let go,\r\nare stopped again. Now, if by repeated acts of frequent entertaining of\r\na favourite idea of a passion or vice, which natural temperament has\r\nhurried one to, or custom dragged, the _face_ is so often put into that\r\nposture which attends such acts, that the animal spirits find such\r\nlatent passages into its nerves, that it is sometimes unalterably set:\r\nas the _Indian_ religious are by long continuing in strange postures in\r\ntheir _pagods_. But most commonly such a habit is contracted, that it\r\nfalls insensibly into that posture when some present object does not\r\nobliterate that more natural impression by a new, or dissimulation hide\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Hence it is that we see great _drinkers_ with _eyes_ generally set\r\ntowards the nose, the adducent muscles being often employed to let them\r\nsee their loved liquor in the glass at the time of drinking; which were,\r\ntherefore, called _bibitory Lascivious persons_ are remarkable for the\r\n_oculorum nobilis petulantia_, as Petronius calls it. From this also we\r\nmay solve the _Quaker's_ expecting face, waiting for the pretended\r\nspirit; and the melancholy face of the _sectaries_; the _studious_ face\r\nof men of great application of mind; revengeful and _bloody_ men, like\r\nexecutioners in the act: and though silence in a sort may awhile pass\r\nfor wisdom, yet, sooner or later, Saint Martin peeps through the\r\ndisguise to undo all. A _changeable face_ I have observed to show a\r\n_changeable mind_. But I would by no means have what has been said\r\nunderstood as without exception; for I doubt not but sometimes there are\r\nfound men with great and virtuous souls under very unpromising\r\noutsides.\"\r\n\r\nThe great Prince of Condé was very expert in a sort of physiognomy which\r\nshowed the peculiar habits, motions, and postures of familiar life and\r\nmechanical employments. He would sometimes lay wagers with his friends,\r\nthat he would guess, upon the Pont Neuf, what trade persons were of that\r\npassed by, from their walk and air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS DESCRIBED BY MUSICAL NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of describing characters under the names of Musical Instruments\r\nhas been already displayed in two most pleasing papers which embellish\r\nthe _Tatler_, written by Addison. He dwells on this idea with uncommon\r\nsuccess. It has been applauded for its _originality_; and in the\r\ngeneral preface to that work, those papers are distinguished for their\r\nfelicity of imagination. The following paper was published in the year\r\n1700, in a volume of \"Philosophical Transactions and Collections,\" and\r\nthe two numbers of Addison in the year 1710. It is probable that this\r\ninimitable writer borrowed the seminal hint from this work:--\r\n\r\n\"A conjecture at dispositions from the modulations of the voice.\r\n\r\n\"Sitting in some company, and having been but a little before musical, I\r\nchanced to take notice that, in ordinary discourse, _words_ were spoken\r\nin perfect _notes_; and that some of the company used _eighths_, some\r\n_fifths_, some _thirds_; and that his discourse which was the most\r\npleasing, his _words_, as to their tone, consisted most of _concords_,\r\nand were of _discords_ of such as made up harmony. The same person was\r\nthe most affable, pleasant, and best-natured in the company. This\r\nsuggests a reason why many discourses which one _hears_ with much\r\npleasure, when they come to be _read_ scarcely seem the same things.\r\n\r\n\"From this difference of MUSIC in SPEECH, we may conjecture that of\r\nTEMPERS. We know the Doric mood sounds gravity and sobriety; the Lydian,\r\nbuxomness and freedom; the Æolic, sweet stillness and quiet composure;\r\nthe Phrygian, jollity and youthful levity; the Ionic is a stiller of\r\nstorms and disturbances arising from passion; and why may we not\r\nreasonably suppose, that those whose speech naturally runs into the\r\nnotes peculiar to any of these moods, are likewise in nature hereunto\r\ncongenerous? _C Fa ut_ may show me to be of an ordinary capacity, though\r\ngood disposition. _G Sol re ut_, to be peevish and effeminate. _Flats_,\r\na manly or melancholic sadness. He who hath a voice which will in some\r\nmeasure agree with all _cliffs_, to be of good parts, and fit for\r\nvariety of employments, yet somewhat of an inconstant nature. Likewise\r\nfrom the TIMES: so _semi-briefs_ may speak a temper dull and phlegmatic;\r\n_minims_, grave and serious; _crotchets_, a prompt wit; _quavers_,\r\nvehemency of passion, and scolds use them. _Semi-brief-rest_ may denote\r\none either stupid or fuller of thoughts than he can utter; _minimrest,_\r\none that deliberates; _crotchet-rest_, one in a passion. So that from\r\nthe natural use of MOOD, NOTE, and TIME, we may collect DISPOSITIONS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is painful to observe the acrimony which the most eminent scholars\r\nhave infused frequently in their controversial writings. The politeness\r\nof the present times has in some degree softened the malignity of the\r\nman, in the dignity of the author; but this is by no means an\r\nirrevocable law.\r\n\r\nIt is said not to be honourable to literature to revive such\r\ncontroversies; and a work entitled \"Querelles Littéraires,\" when it\r\nfirst appeared, excited loud murmurs; but it has its moral: like showing\r\nthe drunkard to a youth, that he may turn aside disgusted with ebriety.\r\nMust we suppose that men of letters are exempt from the human passions?\r\nTheir sensibility, on the contrary, is more irritable than that of\r\nothers. To observe the ridiculous attitudes in which great men appear,\r\nwhen they employ the style of the fish-market, may be one great means of\r\nrestraining that ferocious pride often breaking out in the republic of\r\nletters. Johnson at least appears to have entertained the same opinion;\r\nfor he thought proper to republish the low invective of _Dryden_ against\r\n_Settle_; and since I have published my \"Quarrels of Authors,\" it\r\nbecomes me to say no more.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated controversy of _Salmasius_, continued by Morus with\r\n_Milton_--the first the pleader of King Charles, the latter the advocate\r\nof the people--was of that magnitude, that all Europe took a part in the\r\npaper-war of these two great men. The answer of Milton, who perfectly\r\nmassacred Salmasius, is now read but by the few. Whatever is addressed\r\nto the times, however great may be its merits, is doomed to perish with\r\nthe times; yet on these pages the philosopher will not contemplate in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nIt will form no uninteresting article to gather a few of the rhetorical\r\n_weeds_, for _flowers_ we cannot well call them, with which they\r\nmutually presented each other. Their rancour was at least equal to their\r\nerudition,--the two most learned antagonists of a learned age!\r\n\r\nSalmasius was a man of vast erudition, but no taste. His writings are\r\nlearned, but sometimes ridiculous. He called his work _Defensio\r\nRegia_, Defence of Kings. The opening of this work provokes a\r\nlaugh:--\"Englishmen! who toss the heads of kings as so many\r\ntennis-balls; who play with crowns as if they were bowls; who look upon\r\nsceptres as so many crooks.\"\r\n\r\nThat the deformity of the body is an idea we attach to the deformity of\r\nthe mind, the vulgar must acknowledge; but surely it is unpardonable in\r\nthe enlightened philosopher thus to compare the crookedness of corporeal\r\nmatter with the rectitude of the intellect; yet Milbourne and Dennis,\r\nthe last a formidable critic, have frequently considered, that comparing\r\nDryden and Pope to whatever the eye turned from with displeasure, was\r\nvery good argument to lower their literary abilities. Salmasius seems\r\nalso to have entertained this idea, though his spies in England gave him\r\nwrong information; or, possibly, he only drew the figure of his own\r\ndistempered imagination.\r\n\r\nSalmasius sometimes reproaches Milton as being but a puny piece of man;\r\nan homunculus, a dwarf deprived of the human figure, a bloodless being,\r\ncomposed of nothing but skin and bone; a contemptible pedagogue, fit\r\nonly to flog his boys: and, rising into a poetic frenzy, applies to him\r\nthe words of Virgil, \"_Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen\r\nademptum_.\" Our great poet thought this senseless declamation merited a\r\nserious refutation; perhaps he did not wish to appear despicable in the\r\neyes of the ladies; and he would not be silent on the subject, he says,\r\nlest any one should consider him as the credulous Spaniards are made to\r\nbelieve by their priests, that a heretic is a kind of rhinoceros or a\r\ndog-headed monster. Milton says, that he does not think any one ever\r\nconsidered him as unbeautiful; that his size rather approaches\r\nmediocrity than, the diminutive; that he still felt the same courage and\r\nthe same strength which he possessed when young, when, with his sword,\r\nhe felt no difficulty to combat with men more robust than himself; that\r\nhis face, far from being pale, emaciated, and wrinkled, was sufficiently\r\ncreditable to him: for though he had passed his fortieth year, he was in\r\nall other respects ten years younger. And very pathetically he adds,\r\n\"that even his eyes, blind as they are, are unblemished in their\r\nappearance; in this instance alone, and much against my inclination, I\r\nam a deceiver!\"\r\n\r\nMorus, in his Epistle dedicatory of his _Regii Sanguinis Clamor_,\r\ncompares Milton to a hangman; his disordered vision to the blindness of\r\nhis soul, and so vomits forth his venom.\r\n\r\nWhen Salmasius found that his strictures on the person of Milton were\r\nfalse, and that, on the contrary, it was uncommonly beautiful, he then\r\nturned his battery against those graces with which Nature had so\r\nliberally adorned his adversary: and it is now that he seems to have\r\nlaid no restrictions on his pen; but, raging with the irritation of\r\nMilton's success, he throws out the blackest calumnies, and the most\r\ninfamous aspersions.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed, when Milton first proposed to answer Salmasius, he\r\nhad lost the use of one of his eyes; and his physicians declared that,\r\nif he applied himself to the controversy, the other would likewise close\r\nfor ever! His patriotism was not to be baffled, but with life itself.\r\nUnhappily, the prediction of his physicians took place! Thus a learned\r\nman in the occupations of study falls blind--a circumstance even now not\r\nread without sympathy. Salmasius considers it as one from which he may\r\ndraw caustic ridicule and satiric severity.\r\n\r\nSalmasius glories that Milton lost his health and his eyes in answering\r\nhis apology for King Charles! He does not now reproach him with natural\r\ndeformities; but he malignantly sympathises with him, that he now no\r\nmore is in possession of that beauty which rendered him so amiable\r\nduring his residence in _Italy_. He speaks more plainly in a following\r\npage; and, in a word, would blacken the austere virtue of Milton with a\r\ncrime infamous to name.\r\n\r\nImpartiality of criticism obliges us to confess that Milton was not\r\ndestitute of rancour. When he was told that his adversary boasted he had\r\noccasioned the loss of his eyes, he answered, with ferocity--\"_And I\r\nshall cost him his life!_\" A prediction which was soon after verified;\r\nfor Christina, Queen of Sweden, withdrew her patronage from Salmasius,\r\nand sided with Milton. The universal neglect the proud scholar felt\r\nhastened his death in the course of a twelve-month.\r\n\r\nThe greatness of Milton's mind was degraded! He actually condescended to\r\nenter into a correspondence in Holland, to obtain little scandalous\r\nanecdotes of his miserable adversary, Morus; and deigned to adulate the\r\nunworthy Christina of Sweden, because she had expressed herself\r\nfavourably on his \"Defence.\" Of late years, we have had too many\r\ninstances of this worst of passions, the antipathies of politics!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF NEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the Italians for the idea of newspapers. The title of\r\ntheir _gazettas_ was, perhaps, derived from _gazzera_, a magpie or\r\nchatterer; or, more probably, from a farthing coin, peculiar to the city\r\nof Venice, called _gazetta_, which was the common price of the\r\nnewspapers. Another etymologist is for deriving it from the Latin\r\n_gaza_, which would colloquially lengthen into _gazetta_, and signify a\r\nlittle treasury of news. The Spanish derive it from the Latin _gaza_,\r\nand likewise their _gazatero_, and our _gazetteer_, for a writer of the\r\n_gazette_ and, what is peculiar to themselves, _gazetista_, for a lover\r\nof the gazette.\r\n\r\nNewspapers, then, took their birth in that principal land of modern\r\npoliticians, Italy, and under the government of that aristocratical\r\nrepublic, Venice. The first paper was a Venetian one, and only monthly;\r\nbut it was merely the newspaper of the government. Other governments\r\nafterwards adopted the Venetian plan of a newspaper, with the Venetian\r\nname:--from a solitary government gazette, an inundation of newspapers\r\nhas burst upon us.\r\n\r\nMr. George Chalmers, in his Life of Ruddiman, gives a curious particular\r\nof these Venetian gazettes:--\"A jealous government did not allow a\r\n_printed_ newspaper; and the Venetian _gazetta_ continued long after the\r\ninvention of printing, to the close of the sixteenth century, and even\r\nto our own days, to be distributed in _manuscript_.\" In the\r\nMagliabechian library at Florence are thirty volumes of Venetian\r\ngazettas, all in manuscript.\r\n\r\nThose who first wrote newspapers were called by the Italians _menanti_;\r\nbecause, says Vossius, they intended commonly by these loose papers to\r\nspread about defamatory reflections, and were therefore prohibited in\r\nItaly by Gregory XIII. by a particular bull, under the name of\r\n_menantes_, from the Latin _minantes_, threatening. Menage, however,\r\nderives it from the Italian _menare_, which signifies to lead at large,\r\nor spread afar.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the wisdom of Elizabeth and the prudence of Burleigh\r\nfor the first newspaper. The epoch of the Spanish Armada is also the\r\nepoch of a genuine newspaper. In the British Museum are several\r\nnewspapers which were printed while the Spanish fleet was in the English\r\nChannel during the year 1588. It was a wise policy to prevent, during a\r\nmoment of general anxiety, the danger of false reports, by publishing\r\nreal information. The earliest newspaper is entitled \"The English\r\nMercurie,\" which by _authority_ was \"imprinted at London by her\r\nhighness's printer, 1588.\" These were, however, but extraordinary\r\ngazettes, not regularly published. In this obscure origin they were\r\nskilfully directed by the policy of that great statesman Burleigh, who,\r\nto inflame the national feeling, gives an extract of a letter from\r\nMadrid which speaks of putting the queen to death, and the instruments\r\nof torture on board the Spanish fleet.\r\n\r\nGeorge Chalmers first exultingly took down these patriarchal newspapers,\r\ncovered with the dust of two centuries.\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper in the collection of the British Museum is marked\r\nNo. 50, and is in Roman, not in black letter. It contains the usual\r\narticles of news, like the London Gazette of the present day. In that\r\ncurious paper, there are news dated from Whitehall, on the 23rd July,\r\n1588. Under the date of July 26, there is the following\r\nnotice:--\"Yesterday the Scots ambassador, being introduced to Sir\r\nFrancis Walsingham, had a private audience of her majesty, to whom he\r\ndelivered a letter from the king his master; containing the most cordial\r\nassurances of his resolution to adhere to her majesty's interests, and\r\nto those of the Protestant religion. And it may not here be improper to\r\ntake notice of a wise and spiritual saying of this young prince (he was\r\ntwenty-two) to the queen's minister at his court, viz.--That all the\r\nfavour he did expect from the Spaniards was the courtesy of Polypheme to\r\nUlysses, _to be the last devoured_.\" The gazetteer of the present day\r\nwould hardly give a more decorous account of the introduction of a\r\nforeign minister. The aptness of King James's classical saying carried\r\nit from the newspaper into history. I must add, that in respect to his\r\n_wit_ no man has been more injured than this monarch. More pointed\r\nsentences are recorded of James I. than perhaps of any prince; and yet,\r\nsuch is the delusion of that medium by which the popular eye sees things\r\nin this world, that he is usually considered as a mere royal pedant. I\r\nhave entered more largely on this subject, in an \"Inquiry of the\r\nLiterary and Political Character of James I.\"[51]\r\n\r\nPeriodical papers seem first to have been more generally used by the\r\nEnglish, during the civil wars of the usurper Cromwell, to disseminate\r\namongst the people the sentiments of loyalty or rebellion, according as\r\ntheir authors were disposed. _Peter Heylin_, in the preface to his\r\n_Cosmography_, mentions, that \"the affairs of each town, of war, were\r\nbetter presented to the reader in the _Weekly News-books_.\" Hence we\r\nfind some papers, entitled \"News from Hull,\" \"Truths from York,\"\r\n\"Warranted Tidings from Ireland,\" &c. We find also, \"The Scots' Dove\"\r\nopposed to \"The Parliament Kite,\" or \"The Secret Owl.\"--Keener\r\nanimosities produced keener titles: \"Heraclitus ridens\" found an\r\nantagonist in \"Democritus ridens,\" and \"The Weekly Discoverer\" was\r\nshortly met by \"The Discoverer stript naked.\" \"Mercuriua Britannicus\"\r\nwas grappled by \"Mercurius Mastix, faithfully lashing all Scouts,\r\nMercuries, Posts, Spies, and others.\" Under all these names papers had\r\nappeared, but a \"Mercury\" was the prevailing title of these\r\n\"News-books,\" and the principles of the writer were generally shown by\r\nthe additional epithet. We find an alarming number of these Mercuries,\r\nwhich, were the story not too long to tell, might excite laughter; they\r\npresent us with a very curious picture of those singular times.\r\n\r\nDevoted to political purposes, they soon became a public nuisance by\r\nserving as receptacles of party malice, and echoing to the farthest ends\r\nof the kingdom the insolent voice of all factions. They set the minds of\r\nmen more at variance, inflamed their tempers to a greater fierceness,\r\nand gave a keener edge to the sharpness of civil discord.\r\n\r\nSuch works will always find adventurers adapted to their scurrilous\r\npurposes, who neither want at times either talents, or boldness, or wit,\r\nor argument. A vast crowd issued from the press, and are now to be found\r\nin private collections. They form a race of authors unknown to most\r\nreaders of these times: the names of some of their chiefs, however, have\r\nreached us, and in the minor chronicle of domestic literature I rank\r\nthree notable heroes; Marchmont Needham, Sir John Birkenhead, and Sir\r\nRoger L'Estrange.\r\n\r\n_Marchmont Needham_, the great patriarch of newspaper writers, was a man\r\nof versatile talents and more versatile politics; a bold adventurer, and\r\nmost successful, because the most profligate of his tribe. From college\r\nhe came to London; was an usher in Merchant Tailors' school; then an\r\nunder clerk in Gray's Inn; at length studied physic, and practised\r\nchemistry; and finally, he was a captain, and in the words of our great\r\nliterary antiquary, \"siding with the rout and scum of the people, he\r\nmade them weekly sport by railing at all that was noble, in his\r\nIntelligence, called Mercurius Britannicus, wherein his endeavours were\r\nto sacrifice the fame of some lord, or any person of quality, and of the\r\nking himself, to the beast with many heads.\" He soon became popular, and\r\nwas known under the name of Captain Needham, of Gray's Inn; and whatever\r\nhe now wrote was deemed oracular. But whether from a slight imprisonment\r\nfor aspersing Charles I. or some pique with his own party, he requested\r\nan audience on his knees with the king, reconciled himself to his\r\nmajesty, and showed himself a violent royalist in his \"Mercurius\r\nPragmaticus,\" and galled the Presbyterians with his wit and quips. Some\r\ntime after, when the popular party prevailed, he was still further\r\nenlightened, and was got over by President Bradshaw, as easily as by\r\nCharles I. Our Mercurial writer became once more a virulent\r\nPresbyterian, and lashed the royalists outrageously in his \"Mercurius\r\nPoliticus;\" at length on the return of Charles II. being now conscious,\r\nsays our cynical friend Anthony, that he might be in danger of the\r\nhalter, once more he is said to have fled into Holland, waiting for an\r\nact of oblivion. For money given to a hungry courtier, Needham obtained\r\nhis pardon under the great seal. He latterly practised as a physician\r\namong his party, but lived detested by the royalists; and now only\r\ncommitted harmless treasons with the College of Physicians, on whom he\r\npoured all that gall and vinegar which the government had suppressed\r\nfrom flowing through its natural channel.\r\n\r\nThe royalists were not without their Needham in the prompt activity of\r\n_Sir John Birkenhead_. In buffoonery, keenness, and boldness, having\r\nbeen frequently imprisoned, he was not inferior, nor was he at times\r\nless an adventurer. His \"Mercurius Aulicus\" was devoted to the court,\r\nthen at Oxford. But he was the fertile parent of numerous political\r\npamphlets, which appear to abound in banter, wit, and satire. Prompt to\r\nseize on every temporary circumstance, he had equal facility in\r\nexecution. His \"Paul's Church-yard\" is a bantering pamphlet, containing\r\nfictitious titles of books and acts of parliament, reflecting on the mad\r\nreformers of those times. One of his poems is entitled \"_The Jolt_,\"\r\nbeing written on the Protector having fallen off his own coach-box:\r\nCromwell had received a present from the German Count Oldenburgh, of six\r\nGerman horses, and attempted to drive them himself in Hyde Park, when\r\nthis great political Phaeton met the accident, of which Sir John\r\nBirkenhead was not slow to comprehend the benefit, and hints how\r\nunfortunately for the country it turned out! Sir John was during the\r\ndominion of Cromwell an author by profession. After various\r\nimprisonments for his majesty's cause, says the venerable historian of\r\nEnglish literature already quoted, \"he lived by his wits, in helping\r\nyoung gentlemen out at dead lifts in making poems, songs, and epistles\r\non and to their mistresses; as also in translating, and other petite\r\nemployments.\" He lived however after the Restoration to become one of\r\nthe masters of requests, with a salary of 3000_l._ a year. But he showed\r\nthe baseness of his spirit, says Anthony, by slighting those who had\r\nbeen his benefactors in his necessities.\r\n\r\nSir _Roger L'Estrange_ among his rivals was esteemed as the most\r\nperfect model of political writing. He was a strong party-writer on the\r\ngovernment side, for Charles the Second, and the compositions of the\r\nauthor seem to us coarse, yet they contain much idiomatic expression.\r\nHis Æsop's Fables are a curious specimen of familiar style. Queen Mary\r\nshowed a due contempt of him, after the Revolution, by this anagram:--\r\n\r\n    _Roger L'Estrange_,\r\n    _Lye strange Roger_!\r\n\r\nSuch were the three patriarchs of newspapers. De Saint Foix gives the\r\norigin of newspapers to France. Renaudot, a physician at Paris, to amuse\r\nhis patients was a great collector of news; and he found by these means\r\nthat he was more sought after than his learned brethren. But as the\r\nseasons were not always sickly, and he had many hours not occupied by\r\nhis patients, he reflected, after several years of assiduity given up to\r\nthis singular employment, that he might turn it to a better account, by\r\ngiving every week to his patients, who in this case were the public at\r\nlarge, some fugitive sheets which should contain the news of various\r\ncountries. He obtained a privilege for this purpose in 1632.\r\n\r\nAt the Restoration the proceedings of parliament were interdicted to be\r\npublished, unless by authority; and the first daily paper after the\r\nRevolution took the popular title of \"The Orange Intelligencer.\"\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen _Anne_, there was but one daily paper; the others\r\nwere weekly. Some attempted to introduce literary subjects, and others\r\ntopics of a more general speculation. _Sir Richard Steele_ formed the\r\nplan of his _Tatler_. He designed it to embrace the three provinces, of\r\nmanners and morals, of literature, and of politics. The public were to\r\nbe conducted insensibly into so different a track from that to which\r\nthey had been hitherto accustomed. Hence politics were admitted into his\r\npaper. But it remained for the chaster genius of _Addison_ to banish\r\nthis painful topic from his elegant pages. The writer in polite letters\r\nfelt himself degraded by sinking into the diurnal narrator of political\r\nevents, which so frequently originate in rumours and party fictions.\r\nFrom this time, newspapers and periodical literature became distinct\r\nworks--at present, there seems to be an attempt to revive this union; it\r\nis a retrograde step for the independent dignity of literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Since the appearance of the _eleventh_ edition of this\r\nwork, the detection of a singular literary deception has occurred. The\r\nevidence respecting _The English Mercurie_ rests on the alleged\r\ndiscovery of the literary antiquary, George Chalmers. I witnessed, fifty\r\nyears ago, that laborious researcher busied among the long dusty shelves\r\nof our periodical papers, which then reposed in the ante-chamber to the\r\nformer reading-room of the British Museum. To the industry which I had\r\nwitnessed, I confided, and such positive and precise evidence could not\r\nfail to be accepted by all. In the British Museum, indeed, George\r\nChalmers found the printed _English Mercurie_; but there also, it now\r\nappears, he might have seen _the original_, with all its corrections,\r\nbefore it was sent to the press, written on paper of modern fabric. The\r\ndetection of this literary imposture has been ingeniously and\r\nunquestionably demonstrated by Mr. Thomas Watts, in a letter to Mr.\r\nPanizzi, the keeper of the printed books in the British Museum. The fact\r\nis, the whole is a modern forgery, for which Birch, preserving it among\r\nhis papers, has not assigned either the occasion or the motive. Mr.\r\nWatts says--\"The general impression left on the mind by the perusal of\r\nthe _Mercurie_ is, that it must have been written after the\r\n_Spectator_\"; that the manuscript was composed in modern spelling,\r\nafterwards _antiquated_ in the printed copy; while the type is similar\r\nto that used by Caslon in 1766. By this accidental reference to the\r\noriginals, \"the unaccountably successful imposition of fifty years was\r\nshattered to fragments in five minutes.\" I am inclined to suspect that\r\nit was a _jeu d'esprit_ of historical antiquarianism, concocted by Birch\r\nand his friends the Yorkes, with whom, as it is well known, he was\r\nconcerned in a more elegant literary recreation, the composition of the\r\nAthenian Letters. The blunder of George Chalmers has been repeated in\r\nnumerous publications throughout Europe and in America. I think it\r\nbetter to correct the text by this notice than by a silent suppression,\r\nthat it may remain a memorable instance of the danger incurred by the\r\nhistorian from forged documents; and a proof that multiplied authorities\r\nadd no strength to evidence, when nil are to be traced to a single\r\nsource.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIALS AND PROOFS OF GUILT IN SUPERSTITIOUS AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strange trials to which those suspected of guilt were put in the\r\nmiddle ages, conducted with many devout ceremonies by the ministers of\r\nreligion, were pronounced to be the _judgments of God_! The ordeal\r\nconsisted of various kinds: walking blindfold amidst burning\r\nploughshares; passing through fires; holding in the hand a red-hot bar;\r\nand plunging the arm into boiling water: the popular affirmation--\"I\r\nwill put my hand in the fire to confirm this,\" was derived from this\r\ncustom of our rude ancestors. Challenging the accuser to single combat,\r\nwhen frequently the stoutest champion was allowed to supply their place;\r\nswallowing a morsel of consecrated bread; sinking or swimming in a river\r\nfor witchcraft; or weighing a witch; stretching out the arms before the\r\ncross, till the champion soonest wearied dropped his arms, and lost his\r\nestate, which was decided by this very short chancery suit, called the\r\n_judicium crucis_. The bishop of Paris and the abbot of St. Denis\r\ndisputed about the patronage of a monastery: Pepin the Short, not being\r\nable to decide on their confused claims, decreed one of these judgments\r\nof God, that of the Cross. The bishop and abbot each chose a man, and\r\nboth the men appeared in the chapel, where they stretched out their arms\r\nin the form of a cross. The spectators, more devout than the mob of the\r\npresent day, but still the mob, were piously attentive, but _betted_\r\nhowever now for one man, now for the other, and critically watched the\r\nslightest motion of the arms. The bishop's man was first tired:--he let\r\nhis arms fall, and ruined his patron's cause for ever. Though sometimes\r\nthese trials might be eluded by the artifice of the priest, numerous\r\nwere the innocent victims who unquestionably suffered in these\r\nsuperstitious practices.\r\n\r\nFrom the tenth to the twelfth century they were common. Hildebert,\r\nbishop of Mans, being accused of high treason by our William Rufus, was\r\nprepared to undergo one of these trials, when Ives, bishop of Chartres,\r\nconvinced him that they were against the canons of the constitutions of\r\nthe church, and adds, that in this manner _Innocentiam defendere, set\r\ninnocentiam perdere_.\r\n\r\nAn abbot of St. Aubin, of Angers, in 1066, having refused to present a\r\nhorse to the Viscount of Tours, which the viscount claimed in right of\r\nhis lordship, whenever an abbot first took possession of that abbey, the\r\necclesiastic offered to justify himself by the trial of the ordeal, or\r\nby duel, for which he proposed to furnish a man. The viscount at first\r\nagreed to the duel; but, reflecting that these combats, though\r\nsanctioned by the church, depended wholly on the skill or vigour of the\r\nadversary, and could therefore afford no substantial proof of the equity\r\nof his claim, he proposed to compromise the matter in a manner which\r\nstrongly characterises the times: he waived his claim, on condition that\r\nthe abbot should not forget to mention in his prayers himself, his wife,\r\nand his brothers! As the _orisons_ appeared to the abbot, in comparison\r\nwith the _horse_, of little or no value, he accepted the proposal.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century the right of representation was not fixed: it was a\r\nquestion whether the sons of a son ought to be reckoned among the\r\nchildren of the family, and succeed equally with their uncles, if their\r\nfathers happened to die while their grandfathers survived. This point\r\nwas decided by one of these combats. The champion in behalf of the right\r\nof children to represent their deceased father proved victorious. It was\r\nthen established by a perpetual decree that they should thenceforward\r\nshare in the inheritance, together with their uncles. In the eleventh\r\ncentury the same mode was practised to decide respecting two rival\r\n_Liturgies_! A pair of knights, clad in complete armour, were the\r\ncritics to decide which was the authentic.\r\n\r\n\"If two neighbours,\" say the capitularies of Dagobert, \"dispute\r\nrespecting the boundaries of their possessions, let a piece of turf of\r\nthe contested land be dug up by the judge, and brought by him into the\r\ncourt; the two parties shall touch it with the points of their swords,\r\ncalling on God as a witness of their claims;--after this let them\r\n_combat_, and let victory decide on their rights!\"\r\n\r\nIn Germany, a solemn circumstance was practised in these judicial\r\ncombats. In the midst of the lists they placed a _bier_.--By its side\r\nstood the accuser and the accused; one at the head and the other at the\r\nfoot of the bier, and leaned there for some time in profound silence,\r\nbefore they began the combat.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the age are faithfully painted in the ancient Fabliaux.\r\nThe judicial combat is introduced by a writer of the fourteenth century,\r\nin a scene where Pilate challenges Jesus Christ to _single combat_.\r\nAnother describes the person who pierced the side of Christ as _a knight\r\nwho jousted with Jesus_.[52]\r\n\r\nJudicial combat appears to have been practised by the Jews. Whenever the\r\nrabbins had to decide on a dispute about property between two parties,\r\nneither of which could produce evidence to substantiate his claim, they\r\nterminated it by single combat. The rabbins were impressed by a notion,\r\nthat consciousness of right would give additional confidence and\r\nstrength to the rightful possessor. It may, however, be more\r\nphilosophical to observe, that such judicial combats were more\r\nfrequently favourable to the criminal than to the innocent, because the\r\nbold wicked man is usually more ferocious and hardy than he whom he\r\nsingles out as his victim, and who only wishes to preserve his own quiet\r\nenjoyment:--in this case the assailant is the more terrible combatant.\r\n\r\nThose accused of robbery were put to trial by a piece of barley-bread,\r\non which the mass had been said; which if they could not swallow, they\r\nwere declared guilty. This mode of trial was improved by adding to the\r\n_bread_ a slice of _cheese_; and such was their credulity, that they\r\nwere very particular in this holy _bread_ and _cheese_, called the\r\n_corsned_. The bread was to be of unleavened barley, and the cheese made\r\nof ewe's milk in the month of May.\r\n\r\nDu Cange observed, that the expression--\"_May this piece of bread choke\r\nme!_\" comes from this custom. The anecdote of Earl Godwin's death by\r\nswallowing a piece of bread, in making this asseveration, is recorded in\r\nour history. Doubtless superstition would often terrify the innocent\r\nperson, in the attempt of swallowing a consecrated morsel.\r\n\r\nAmong the proofs of guilt in superstitious ages was that of the\r\n_bleeding of a corpse_. It was believed, that at the touch or approach\r\nof the murderer the blood gushed out of the murdered. By the side of the\r\nbier, if the slightest change was observable in the eyes, the mouth,\r\nfeet, or hands of the corpse, the murderer was conjectured to be\r\npresent, and many innocent spectators must have suffered death. \"When a\r\nbody is full of blood, warmed by a sudden external heat, and a\r\nputrefaction coming on, some of the blood-vessels will burst, as they\r\nwill all in time.\" This practice was once allowed in England, and is\r\nstill looked on in some of the uncivilized parts of these kingdoms as a\r\ndetection of the criminal. It forms a solemn picture in the histories\r\nand ballads of our old writers.\r\n\r\nRobertson observes, that all these absurd institutions were cherished\r\nfrom the superstitious of the age believing the legendary histories of\r\nthose saints who crowd and disgrace the Roman calendar. These fabulous\r\nmiracles had been declared authentic by the bulls of the popes and the\r\ndecrees of councils; they were greedily swallowed by the populace; and\r\nwhoever believed that the Supreme Being had interposed miraculously on\r\nthose trivial occasions mentioned in legends, could not but expect the\r\nintervention of Heaven in these most solemn appeals. These customs were\r\na substitute for written laws, which that barbarous period had not; and\r\nas no society can exist without _laws_, the ignorance of the people had\r\nrecourse to these _customs_, which, evil and absurd as they were, closed\r\nendless controversies. Ordeals are in truth the rude laws of a barbarous\r\npeople who have not yet obtained a written code, and are not\r\nsufficiently advanced in civilization to enter into the refined\r\ninquiries, the subtile distinctions, and elaborate investigations, which\r\na court of law demands.\r\n\r\nThese ordeals probably originate in that one of Moses called the \"Waters\r\nof Jealousy.\" The Greeks likewise had ordeals, for in the Antigonus of\r\nSophocles the soldiers offer to prove their innocence by handling\r\nred-hot iron, and walking between fires. One cannot but smile at the\r\nwhimsical ordeals of the Siamese. Among other practices to discover the\r\njustice of a cause, civil or criminal, they are particularly attached to\r\nusing certain consecrated purgative pills, which they make the\r\ncontending parties swallow. He who _retains_ them longest gains his\r\ncause! The practice of giving Indians a consecrated grain of rice to\r\nswallow is known to discover the thief, in any company, by the\r\ncontortions and dismay evident on the countenance of the real thief.\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages, they were acquainted with _secrets_ to pass unhurt\r\nthese singular trials. Voltaire mentions one for undergoing the ordeal\r\nof boiling water. Our late travellers in the East have confirmed this\r\nstatement. The Mevleheh dervises can hold red-hot iron between their\r\nteeth. Such artifices have been often publicly exhibited at Paris and\r\nLondon. Mr. Sharon Turner observes, on the ordeal of the Anglo-Saxons,\r\nthat the hand was not to be immediately inspected, and was left to the\r\nchance of a good constitution to be so far healed during three days (the\r\ntime they required to be bound up and sealed, before it was examined) as\r\nto discover those appearances when inspected, which were allowed to be\r\nsatisfactory. There was likewise much preparatory training, suggested by\r\nthe more experienced; besides, the accused had an opportunity of _going\r\nalone into the church_, and making _terms_ with the _priest_. The few\r\n_spectators_ were always _distant_; and cold iron might be substituted,\r\nand the fire diminished, at the moment.\r\n\r\nThey possessed secrets and medicaments, to pass through these trials in\r\nperfect security. An anecdote of these times may serve to show their\r\nreadiness. A rivalship existed between the Austin-friars and the\r\nJesuits. The father-general of the Austin-friars was dining with the\r\nJesuits; and when the table was removed, he entered into a formal\r\ndiscourse of the superiority of the monastic order, and charged the\r\nJesuits, in unqualified terms, with assuming the title of \"fratres,\"\r\nwhile they held not the three vows, which other monks were obliged to\r\nconsider as sacred and binding. The general of the Austin-friars was\r\nvery eloquent and very authoritative:--and the superior of the Jesuits\r\nwas very unlearned, but not half a fool.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit avoided entering the list of controversy with the\r\nAustin-friar, but arrested his triumph by asking him if he would see one\r\nof his friars, who pretended to be nothing more than a Jesuit, and one\r\nof the Austin-friars who religiously performed the aforesaid three vows,\r\nshow instantly which of them would be the readier to obey his\r\nsuperiors? The Austin-friar consented. The Jesuit then turning to one of\r\nhis brothers, the holy friar Mark, who was waiting on them, said,\r\n\"Brother Mark, our companions are cold. I command you, in virtue of the\r\nholy obedience you have sworn to me, to bring here instantly out of the\r\nkitchen-fire, and in your hands, some burning coals, that they may warm\r\nthemselves over your hands.\" Father Mark instantly obeys, and, to the\r\nastonishment of the Austin-friar, brought in his hands a supply of red\r\nburning coals, and held them to whoever chose to warm himself; and at\r\nthe command of his superior returned them to the kitchen-hearth. The\r\ngeneral of the Austin-friars, with the rest of his brotherhood, stood\r\namazed; he looked wistfully on one of his monks, as if he wished to\r\ncommand him to do the like. But the Austin monk, who perfectly\r\nunderstood him, and saw this was not a time to hesitate,\r\nobserved,--\"Reverend father, forbear, and do not command me to tempt\r\nGod! I am ready to fetch you fire in a chafing-dish, but not in my bare\r\nhands.\" The triumph of the Jesuits was complete; and it is not necessary\r\nto add, that the _miracle_ was noised about, and that the Austin-friars\r\ncould never account for it, notwithstanding their strict performance of\r\nthe three vows!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: These curious passages, so strikingly indicative of the\r\nstate of thought in the days of their authors, are worth clearly noting.\r\nPilate's challenge to the Saviour is completely in the taste of the\r\nwriter's day. He was Adam Davie, a poet of the fourteenth century, of\r\nwhom an account is preserved in _Warton's History of English Poetry_;\r\nand the passage occurs in his poem of the _Battle of Jerusalem_, the\r\nincidents of which are treated as Froissart would treat the siege of a\r\ntown happening in his own day.\r\n\r\nThe second passage above quoted occurs in the _Vision of Piers Plowman_,\r\na poem of the same era, where the Roman soldier--whose name, according\r\nto legendary history, was Longinus, and who pierced the Saviour's\r\nside--is described as if he had given the wound in a passage of arms, or\r\njoust; and elsewhere in the same poem it is said that Christ,\r\n\r\n    \"For mankyndes sake,\r\n    Justed in Jerusalem,\r\n    A joye to us all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in another part of the poem, speaking of the victory of Christ, it\r\nis said--\r\n\r\n    \"Jhesus justede well.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INQUISITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nInnocent the Third, a pope as enterprising as he was successful in his\r\nenterprises, having sent Dominic with some missionaries into Languedoc,\r\nthese men so irritated the heretics they were sent to convert, that most\r\nof them were assassinated at Toulouse in the year 1200. He called in the\r\naid of temporal arms, and published against them a crusade, granting, as\r\nwas usual with the popes on similar occasions, all kinds of indulgences\r\nand pardons to those who should arm against these _Mahometans_, so he\r\ntermed these unfortunate Languedocians. Once all were Turks when they\r\nwere not Romanists. Raymond, Count of Toulouse, was constrained to\r\nsubmit. The inhabitants were passed on the edge of the sword, without\r\ndistinction of age or sex. It was then he established that scourge of\r\nEurope, THE INQUISITION. This pope considered that, though men might be\r\ncompelled to submit by arms, numbers might remain professing particular\r\ndogmas; and he established this sanguinary tribunal solely to inspect\r\ninto all families, and INQUIRE concerning all persons who they imagined\r\nwere unfriendly to the interests of Rome. Dominic did so much by his\r\npersecuting inquiries, that he firmly established the Inquisition at\r\nToulouse.\r\n\r\nNot before the year 1484 it became known in Spain. To another Dominican,\r\nJohn de Torquemada, the court of Rome owed this obligation. As he was\r\nthe confessor of Queen Isabella, he had extorted from her a promise,\r\nthat if ever she ascended the throne, she would use every means to\r\nextirpate heresy and heretics. Ferdinand had conquered Granada, and had\r\nexpelled from the Spanish realms multitudes of unfortunate Moors. A few\r\nremained, whom, with the Jews, he compelled to become Christians: they\r\nat least assumed the name; but it was well known that both these nations\r\nnaturally respected their own faith, rather than that of the Christians.\r\nThis race was afterwards distinguished as _Christianos Novos_; and in\r\nforming marriages, the blood of the Hidalgo was considered to lose its\r\npurity by mingling with such a suspicious source.\r\n\r\nTorquemada pretended that this dissimulation would greatly hurt the\r\ninterests of the holy religion. The queen listened with respectful\r\ndiffidence to her confessor; and at length gained over the king to\r\nconsent to the establishment of this unrelenting tribunal. Torquemada,\r\nindefatigable in his zeal for the holy chair, in the space of fourteen\r\nyears that he exercised the office of chief inquisitor, is said to have\r\nprosecuted near eighty thousand persons, of whom six thousand were\r\ncondemned to the flames.\r\n\r\nVoltaire attributes the taciturnity of the Spaniards to the universal\r\nhorror such proceedings spread. \"A general jealousy and suspicion took\r\npossession of all ranks of people: friendship and sociability were at an\r\nend! Brothers were afraid of brothers, fathers of their children.\"\r\n\r\nThe situation and the feelings of one imprisoned in the cells of the\r\nInquisition are forcibly painted by Orobio, a mild, and meek, and\r\nlearned man, whose controversy with Limborch is well known. When he\r\nescaped from Spain he took refuge in Holland, was circumcised, and died\r\na philosophical Jew. He has left this admirable description of himself\r\nin the cell of the Inquisition. \"Inclosed in this dungeon I could not\r\neven find space enough to turn myself about; I suffered so much that I\r\nfelt my brain disordered. I frequently asked myself, am I really Don\r\nBalthazar Orobio, who used to walk about Seville at my pleasure, who so\r\ngreatly enjoyed myself with my wife and children? I often imagined that\r\nall my life had only been a dream, and that I really had been born in\r\nthis dungeon! The only amusement I could invent was metaphysical\r\ndisputations. I was at once opponent, respondent, and præses!\"\r\n\r\nIn the cathedral at Saragossa is the tomb of a famous inquisitor; six\r\npillars surround this tomb; to each is chained a Moor, as preparatory to\r\nhis being burnt. On this St. Foix ingeniously observes, \"If ever the\r\nJack Ketch of any country should be rich enough to have a splendid tomb,\r\nthis might serve as an excellent model.\"\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition punished heretics by _fire_, to elude the maxim,\r\n\"_Ecclesia non novit sanguinem_;\" for burning a man, say they, does not\r\n_shed his blood_. Otho, the bishop at the Norman invasion, in the\r\ntapestry worked by Matilda the queen of William the Conqueror, is\r\nrepresented with a _mace_ in his hand, for the purpose that when he\r\n_despatched_ his antagonist he might not _spill blood_, but only break\r\nhis bones! Religion has had her quibbles as well as law.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of this despotic order was resisted in France; but it\r\nmay perhaps surprise the reader that a recorder of London, in a speech,\r\nurged the necessity of setting up an Inquisition in England! It was on\r\nthe trial of Penn the Quaker, in 1670, who was acquitted by the jury,\r\nwhich highly provoked the said recorder. \"_Magna Charta_,\" writes the\r\nprefacer to the trial, \"with the recorder of London, is nothing more\r\nthan _Magna F----!_\" It appears that the jury, after being kept two days\r\nand two nights to alter their verdict, were in the end both fined and\r\nimprisoned. Sir John Howell, the recorder, said, \"Till now I never\r\nunderstood the reason of the policy and prudence of the Spaniards in\r\nsuffering the Inquisition among them; and certainly it will not be well\r\nwith us, till something _like unto the Spanish Inquisition be in\r\nEngland_.\" Thus it will ever be, while both parties struggling for the\r\npre-eminence rush to the sharp extremity of things, and annihilate the\r\ntrembling balance of the constitution. But the adopted motto of Lord\r\nErskine must ever be that of every Briton, \"_Trial by Jury_.\"\r\n\r\nSo late as the year 1761, Gabriel Malagrida, an old man of seventy, was\r\nburnt by these evangelical executioners. His trial was printed at\r\nAmsterdam, 1762, from the Lisbon copy. And for what was this unhappy\r\nJesuit condemned? Not, as some have imagined, for his having been\r\nconcerned in a conspiracy against the king of Portugal. No other charge\r\nis laid to him in this trial but that of having indulged certain\r\nheretical notions, which any other tribunal but that of the Inquisition\r\nwould have looked upon as the delirious fancies of a fanatical old man.\r\nWill posterity believe, that in the eighteenth century an aged visionary\r\nwas led to the stake for having said, amongst other extravagances, that\r\n\"The holy Virgin having commanded him to write the life of Anti-Christ,\r\ntold him that he, Malagrida, was a second John, but more clear than John\r\nthe Evangelist; that there were to be three Anti-Christs, and that the\r\nlast should be born at Milan, of a monk and a nun, in the year 1920; and\r\nthat he would marry Proserpine, one of the infernal furies.\"\r\n\r\nFor such ravings as these the unhappy old man was burnt in recent times.\r\nGranger assures us, that in his remembrance a _horse_ that had been\r\ntaught to tell the spots upon cards, the hour of the day, &c., by\r\nsignificant tokens, was, together with his _owner_, put into the\r\nInquisition for _both_ of them dealing with the devil! A man of letters\r\ndeclared that, having fallen into their hands, nothing perplexed him so\r\nmuch as the ignorance of the inquisitor and his council; and it seemed\r\nvery doubtful whether they had read even the Scriptures.[53]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting anecdotes relating to the terrible\r\nInquisition, exemplifying how the use of the diabolical engines of\r\ntorture forces men to confess crimes they have not been guilty of, was\r\nrelated to me by a Portuguese gentleman.\r\n\r\nA nobleman in Lisbon having heard that his physician and friend was\r\nimprisoned by the Inquisition, under the stale pretext of Judaism,\r\naddressed a letter to one of them to request his freedom, assuring the\r\ninquisitor that his friend was as orthodox a Christian as himself. The\r\nphysician, notwithstanding this high recommendation, was put to the\r\ntorture; and, as was usually the case, at the height of his sufferings\r\nconfessed everything they wished! This enraged the nobleman, and\r\nfeigning a dangerous illness he begged the inquisitor would come to give\r\nhim his last spiritual aid.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Dominican arrived, the lord, who had prepared his\r\nconfidential servants, commanded the inquisitor in their presence to\r\nacknowledge himself a Jew, to write his confession, and to sign it. On\r\nthe refusal of the inquisitor, the nobleman ordered his people to put on\r\nthe inquisitor's head a red-hot helmet, which to his astonishment, in\r\ndrawing aside a screen, he beheld glowing in a small furnace. At the\r\nsight of this new instrument of torture, \"Luke's iron crown,\" the monk\r\nwrote and subscribed the abhorred confession. The nobleman then\r\nobserved, \"See now the enormity of your manner of proceeding with\r\nunhappy men! My poor physician, like you, has confessed Judaism; but\r\nwith this difference, only torments have forced that from him which fear\r\nalone has drawn from you!\"\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition has not failed of receiving its due praises. Macedo, a\r\nPortuguese Jesuit, has discovered the \"Origin of the _Inquisition_\" in\r\nthe terrestrial Paradise, and presumes to allege that God was the first\r\nwho began the functions of an _inquisitor_ over Cain and the workmen of\r\nBabel! Macedo, however, is not so dreaming a personage as he appears;\r\nfor he obtained a Professor's chair at Padua for the arguments he\r\ndelivered at Venice against the pope, which were published by the title\r\nof \"The literary Roarings of the Lion at St. Mark;\" besides he is the\r\nauthor of 109 different works; but it is curious to observe how far our\r\ninterest is apt to prevail over our conscience,--Macedo praised the\r\nInquisition up to the skies, while he sank the pope to nothing!\r\n\r\nAmong the great revolutions of this age, and since the last edition of\r\nthis work, the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal is abolished--but its\r\nhistory enters into that of the human mind; and the history of the\r\nInquisition by Limborch, translated by Chandler, with a very curious\r\n\"Introduction,\" loses none of its value with the philosophical mind.\r\nThis monstrous tribunal of human opinions aimed at the sovereignty of\r\nthe intellectual world, without intellect.\r\n\r\nIn these changeful times, the history of the Inquisition is not the\r\nleast mutable. The Inquisition, which was abolished, was again\r\nrestored--and at the present moment, I know not whether it is to be\r\nrestored or abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: See also the remark of Galileo in a previous page of this\r\nvolume, in the article headed \"The Persecuted Learned.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSINGULARITIES OBSERVED BY VARIOUS NATIONS IN THEIR REPASTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Maldivian islanders eat alone. They retire into the most hidden\r\nparts of their houses; and they draw down the cloths that serve as\r\nblinds to their windows, that they may eat unobserved. This custom\r\nprobably arises from the savage, in early periods of society, concealing\r\nhimself to eat: he fears that another, with as sharp an appetite, but\r\nmore strong than himself, should come and ravish his meal from him. The\r\nideas of witchcraft are also widely spread among barbarians; and they\r\nare not a little fearful that some incantation may be thrown among their\r\nvictuals.\r\n\r\nIn noticing the solitary meal of the Maldivian islander, another reason\r\nmay be alleged for this misanthropical repast. They never will eat with\r\nany one who is inferior to them in birth, in riches, or dignity; and as\r\nit is a difficult matter to settle this equality, they are condemned to\r\nlead this unsocial life.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the islanders of the Philippines are remarkably social.\r\nWhenever one of them finds himself without a companion to partake of his\r\nmeal, he runs till he meets with one; and we are assured that, however\r\nkeen his appetite may be, he ventures not to satisfy it without a\r\nguest.[54]\r\n\r\nSavages, says Montaigne, when they eat, \"_S'essuyent les doigts aux\r\ncuisses, à la bourse des génitoires, et à la plante des pieds_.\" We\r\ncannot forbear exulting in the polished convenience of napkins!\r\n\r\nThe tables of the rich Chinese shine with a beautiful varnish, and are\r\ncovered with silk carpets very elegantly worked. They do not make use of\r\nplates, knives, and forks: every guest has two little ivory or ebony\r\nsticks, which he handles very adroitly.\r\n\r\nThe Otaheiteans, who are naturally social, and very gentle in their\r\nmanners, feed separately from each other. At the hour of repast, the\r\nmembers of each family divide; two brothers, two sisters, and even\r\nhusband and wife, father and mother, have each their respective basket.\r\nThey place themselves at the distance of two or three yards from each\r\nother; they turn their backs, and take their meal in profound silence.\r\n\r\nThe custom of drinking at different hours from those assigned for eating\r\nexists among many savage nations. Originally begun from necessity, it\r\nbecame a habit, which subsisted even when the fountain was near to them.\r\nA people transplanted, observes an ingenious philosopher, preserve in\r\nanother climate modes of living which relate to those from whence they\r\noriginally came. It is thus the Indians of Brazil scrupulously abstain\r\nfrom eating when they drink, and from drinking when they eat.[55]\r\n\r\nWhen neither decency nor politeness is known, the man who invites his\r\nfriends to a repast is greatly embarrassed to testify his esteem for his\r\nguests, and to offer them some amusement; for the savage guest imposes\r\non himself this obligation. Amongst the greater part of the American\r\nIndians, the host is continually on the watch to solicit them to eat,\r\nbut touches nothing himself. In New France, he wearies himself with\r\nsinging, to divert the company while they eat.\r\n\r\nWhen civilization advances, men wish to show their confidence to their\r\nfriends: they treat their guests as relations; and it is said that in\r\nChina the master of a house, to give a mark of his politeness, absents\r\nhimself while his guests regale themselves at his table with undisturbed\r\nrevelry.[56]\r\n\r\nThe demonstrations of friendship in a rude state have a savage and gross\r\ncharacter, which it is not a little curious to observe. The Tartars pull\r\na man by the ear to press him to drink, and they continue tormenting him\r\ntill he opens his mouth; then they clap their hands and dance before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNo customs seem more ridiculous than those practised by a Kamschatkan,\r\nwhen he wishes to make another his friend. He first invites him to eat.\r\nThe host and his guest strip themselves in a cabin which is heated to an\r\nuncommon degree. While the guest devours the food with which they serve\r\nhim, the other continually stirs the fire. The stranger must bear the\r\nexcess of the heat as well as of the repast. He vomits ten times before\r\nhe will yield; but, at length obliged to acknowledge himself overcome,\r\nhe begins to compound matters. He purchases a moment's respite by a\r\npresent of clothes or dogs; for his host threatens to heat the cabin,\r\nand oblige him to eat till he dies. The stranger has the right of\r\nretaliation allowed to him: he treats in the same manner, and exacts the\r\nsame presents. Should his host not accept the invitation of him whom he\r\nhad so handsomely regaled, in that case the guest would take possession\r\nof his cabin, till he had the presents returned to him which the other\r\nhad in so singular a manner obtained.\r\n\r\nFor this extravagant custom a curious reason has been alleged. It is\r\nmeant to put the person to a trial, whose friendship is sought. The\r\nKamschatkan who is at the expense of the fires, and the repast, is\r\ndesirous to know if the stranger has the strength to support pain with\r\nhim, and if he is generous enough to share with him some part of his\r\nproperty. While the guest is employed on his meal, he continues heating\r\nthe cabin to an insupportable degree; and for a last proof of the\r\nstranger's constancy and attachment, he exacts more clothes and more\r\ndogs. The host passes through the same ceremonies in the cabin of the\r\nstranger; and he shows, in his turn, with what degree of fortitude he\r\ncan defend his friend. The most singular customs would appear simple, if\r\nit were possible for the philosopher to understand them on the spot.\r\n\r\nAs a distinguishing mark of their esteem, the negroes of Ardra drink out\r\nof one cup at the same time. The king of Loango eats in one house, and\r\ndrinks in another. A Kamschatkan kneels before his guests; he cuts an\r\nenormous slice from a sea-calf; he crams it entire into the mouth of his\r\nfriend, furiously crying out \"_Tana!_\"--There! and cutting away what\r\nhangs about his lips, snatches and swallows it with avidity.\r\n\r\nA barbarous magnificence attended the feasts of the ancient monarchs of\r\nFrance. After their coronation or consecration, when they sat at table,\r\nthe nobility served them on horseback.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: In Cochin-China, a traveller may always obtain his dinner\r\nby simply joining the family of the first house he may choose to enter,\r\nsuch hospitality being the general custom.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _Esprit des Usages, et des Coutumes._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: If the master be present, he devotes himself to cramming\r\nhis guests to repletion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONARCHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaint Chrysostom has this very acute observation on _kings_: Many\r\nmonarchs are infected with a strange wish that their successors may turn\r\nout bad princes. Good kings desire it, as they imagine, continues this\r\npious politician, that their glory will appear the more splendid by the\r\ncontrast; and the bad desire it, as they consider such kings will serve\r\nto countenance their own misdemeanours.\r\n\r\nPrinces, says Gracian, are willing to be _aided_, but not _surpassed_:\r\nwhich maxim is thus illustrated.\r\n\r\nA Spanish lord having frequently played at chess with Philip II., and\r\nwon all the games, perceived, when his Majesty rose from play, that he\r\nwas much ruffled with chagrin. The lord, when he returned home, said to\r\nhis family--\"My children, we have nothing more to do at court: there we\r\nmust expect no favour; for the king is offended at my having won of him\r\nevery game of chess.\" As chess entirely depends on the genius of the\r\nplayers, and not on fortune, King Philip the chess-player conceived he\r\nought to suffer no rival.\r\n\r\nThis appears still clearer by the anecdote told of the Earl of\r\nSunderland, minister to George I., who was partial to the game of chess.\r\nHe once played with the Laird of Cluny, and the learned Cunningham, the\r\neditor of Horace. Cunningham, with too much skill and too much\r\nsincerity, beat his lordship. \"The earl was so fretted at his\r\nsuperiority and surliness, that he dismissed him without any reward.\r\nCluny allowed himself sometimes to be beaten; and by that means got his\r\npardon, with something handsome besides.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Criticon of Gracian, there is a singular anecdote relative to\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nA Polish monarch having quitted his companions when he was hunting, his\r\ncourtiers found him, a few days after, in a market-place, disguised as a\r\nporter, and lending out the use of his shoulders for a few pence. At\r\nthis they were as much surprised as they were doubtful at first whether\r\nthe _porter_ could be his _majesty_. At length they ventured to express\r\ntheir complaints that so great a personage should debase himself by so\r\nvile an employment. His majesty having heard them, replied--\"Upon my\r\nhonour, gentlemen, the load which I quitted is by far heavier than the\r\none you see me carry here: the weightiest is but a straw, when compared\r\nto that world under which I laboured. I have slept more in four nights\r\nthan I have during all my reign. I begin to live, and to be king of\r\nmyself. Elect whom you choose. For me, who am so well, it were madness\r\nto return to _court_.\" Another Polish king, who succeeded this\r\nphilosophic _monarchical porter_, when they placed the sceptre in his\r\nhand, exclaimed--\"I had rather tug at an _oar_!\" The vacillating\r\nfortunes of the Polish monarchy present several of these anecdotes;\r\ntheir monarchs appear to have frequently been philosophers; and, as the\r\nworld is made, an excellent philosopher proves but an indifferent king.\r\n\r\nTwo observations on kings were offered to a courtier with great\r\n_naïveté_ by that experienced politician, the Duke of Alva:--\"Kings who\r\naffect to be familiar with their companions make use of _men_ as they do\r\nof _oranges_; they take oranges to extract their juice, and when they\r\nare well sucked they throw them away. Take care the king does not do the\r\nsame to you; be careful that he does not read all your thoughts;\r\notherwise he will throw you aside to the back of his chest, as a book of\r\nwhich he has read enough.\" \"The squeezed orange,\" the King of Prussia\r\napplied in his dispute with Voltaire.\r\n\r\nWhen it was suggested to Dr. Johnson that kings must be unhappy because\r\nthey are deprived of the greatest of all satisfactions, easy and\r\nunreserved society, he observed that this was an ill-founded notion.\r\n\"Being a king does not exclude a man from such society. Great kings have\r\nalways been social. The King of Prussia, the only great king at present\r\n(this was THE GREAT Frederic) is very social. Charles the Second, the\r\nlast king of England who was a man of parts, was social; our Henries and\r\nEdwards were all social.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Halifax, in his character of Charles II., has exhibited a\r\n_trait_ in the royal character of a good-natured monarch; that _trait_,\r\nis _sauntering_. I transcribe this curious observation, which introduces\r\nus into a levee.\r\n\r\n\"There was as much of laziness as of love in all those hours which he\r\npassed amongst his mistresses, who served only to fill up his seraglio,\r\nwhile a bewitching kind of pleasure, called SAUNTERING, was the sultana\r\nqueen he delighted in.\r\n\r\n\"The thing called SAUNTERING is a stronger temptation to princes than it\r\nis to others.--The being galled with importunities, pursued from one\r\nroom to another with asking faces; the dismal sound of unreasonable\r\ncomplaints and ill-grounded pretences; the deformity of fraud\r\nill-disguised:--all these would make any man run away from them, and I\r\nused to think it was the motive for making him walk so fast.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE TITLES OF ILLUSTRIOUS, HIGHNESS, AND EXCELLENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title of _illustrious_ was never given, till the reign of\r\nConstantine, but to those whose reputation was splendid in arms or in\r\nletters. Adulation had not yet adopted this noble word into her\r\nvocabulary. Suetonius composed a book to record those who had possessed\r\nthis title; and, as it was _then_ bestowed, a moderate volume was\r\nsufficient to contain their names.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Constantine, the title of _illustrious_ was given more\r\nparticularly to those princes who had distinguished themselves in war;\r\nbut it was not continued to their descendants. At length, it became very\r\ncommon; and every son of a prince was _illustrious_. It is now a\r\nconvenient epithet for the poet.\r\n\r\nIn the rage for TITLES the ancient lawyers in Italy were not satisfied\r\nby calling kings ILLUSTRES; they went a step higher, and would have\r\nemperors to be _super-illustres_, a barbarous coinage of their own.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, they published a book of _titles_ for their kings, as well as\r\nfor the Portuguese; but Selden tells us, that \"their _Cortesias_ and\r\ngiving of titles grew at length, through the affectation of heaping\r\ngreat attributes on their princes to such an insufferable forme, that a\r\nremedie was provided against it.\" This remedy was an act published by\r\nPhilip III. which ordained that all the _Cortesias_, as they termed\r\nthese strange phrases they had so servilely and ridiculously invented,\r\nshould be reduced to a simple superscription, \"To the king our lord,\"\r\nleaving out those fantastical attributes of which every secretary had\r\nvied with his predecessors in increasing the number.\r\n\r\nIt would fill three or four of these pages to transcribe the titles and\r\nattributes of the Grand Signior, which he assumes in a letter to Henry\r\nIV. Selden, in his \"Titles of Honour,\" first part, p. 140, has preserved\r\nthem. This \"emperor of victorious emperors,\" as he styles himself, at\r\nlength condescended to agree with the emperor of Germany, in 1606, that\r\nin all their letters and instruments they should be only styled _father_\r\nand _son_: the emperor calling the sultan his son; and the sultan the\r\nemperor, in regard of his years, his _father_.\r\n\r\nFormerly, says Houssaie, the title of _highness_ was only given to\r\nkings; but now it has become so common that all the great houses assume\r\nit. All the great, says a modern, are desirous of being confounded with\r\nprinces, and are ready to seize on the privileges of royal dignity. We\r\nhave already come to _highness_. The pride of our descendants, I\r\nsuspect, will usurp that of _majesty_.\r\n\r\nFerdinand, king of Aragon, and his queen Isabella of Castile, were only\r\ntreated with the title of _highness_. Charles was the first who took\r\nthat of _majesty_: not in his quality of king of Spain, but as emperor.\r\nSt. Foix informs us, that kings were usually addressed by the titles of\r\n_most illustrious_, or _your serenity_, or _your grace_; but that the\r\ncustom of giving them that of _majesty_ was only established by Louis\r\nXI., a prince the least majestic in all his actions, his manners, and\r\nhis exterior--a severe monarch, but no ordinary man, the Tiberius of\r\nFrance. The manners of this monarch were most sordid; in public\r\naudiences he dressed like the meanest of the people, and affected to sit\r\non an old broken chair, with a filthy dog on his knees. In an account\r\nfound of his household, this _majestic_ prince has a charge made him for\r\ntwo new sleeves sewed on one of his old doublets.\r\n\r\nFormerly kings were apostrophised by the title of _your grace_. Henry\r\nVIII. was the first, says Houssaie, who assumed the title of _highness_;\r\nand at length _majesty_. It was Francis I. who saluted him with this\r\nlast title, in their interview in the year 1520, though he called\r\nhimself only the first gentleman in his kingdom!\r\n\r\nSo distinct were once the titles of _highness_ and _excellence_, that\r\nwhen Don Juan, the brother of Philip II., was permitted to take up the\r\nlatter title, and the city of Granada saluted him by the title of\r\n_highness_, it occasioned such serious jealousy at court, that had he\r\npersisted in it, he would have been condemned for treason.\r\n\r\nThe usual title of _cardinals_, about 1600, was _seignoria\r\nillustrissima_; the Duke of Lerma, the Spanish minister and cardinal, in\r\nhis old age, assumed the title of _eccellencia reverendissima_. The\r\nchurch of Rome was in its glory, and to be called _reverend_ was then\r\naccounted a higher honour than to be styled _illustrious_. But by use\r\n_illustrious_ grew familiar, and _reverend_ vulgar, and at last the\r\ncardinals were distinguished by the title of _eminent_.\r\n\r\nAfter all these historical notices respecting these titles, the reader\r\nwill smile when he is acquainted with the reason of an honest curate of\r\nMontferrat, who refused to bestow the title of _highness_ on the duke of\r\nMantua, because he found in his breviary these words, _Tu solus Dominus,\r\ntu solus Altissimus_; from all which he concluded, that none but the\r\nLord was to be honoured with the title of _highness_! The \"Titles of\r\nHonour\" of Selden is a very curious volume, and, as the learned Usher\r\ntold Evelyn, the most valuable work of this great scholar. The best\r\nedition is a folio of about one thousand pages. Selden vindicates the\r\nright of a king of England to the title of _emperor_.\r\n\r\n    \"And never yet was TITLE did not move;\r\n    And never eke a mind, _that_ TITLE did not love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLES OF SOVEREIGNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn countries where despotism exists in all its force, and is gratified\r\nin all its caprices, either the intoxication of power has occasioned\r\nsovereigns to assume the most solemn and the most fantastic titles; or\r\nthe royal duties and functions were considered of so high and extensive\r\na nature, that the people expressed their notion of the pure monarchical\r\nstate by the most energetic descriptions of oriental fancy.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of the Natchez are regarded by their people as the children\r\nof the sun, and they bear the name of their father.\r\n\r\nThe titles which some chiefs assume are not always honourable in\r\nthemselves; it is sufficient if the people respect them. The king of\r\nQuiterva calls himself the _great lion_; and for this reason lions are\r\nthere so much respected, that they are not allowed to kill them, but at\r\ncertain royal huntings.\r\n\r\nThe king of Monomotapa is surrounded by musicians and poets, who adulate\r\nhim by such refined flatteries as _lord of the sun and moon_; _great\r\nmagician_; and _great thief!_--where probably thievery is merely a term\r\nfor dexterity.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatics have bestowed what to us appear as ridiculous titles of\r\nhonour on their _princes_. The king of Arracan assumes the following\r\nones: \"Emperor of Arracan, possessor of the white elephant, and the two\r\near-rings, and in virtue of this possession legitimate heir of Pegu and\r\nBrama; lord of the twelve provinces of Bengal, and the twelve kings who\r\nplace their heads under his feet.\"\r\n\r\nHis majesty of Ava is called _God_: when he writes to a foreign\r\nsovereign he calls himself the king of kings, whom all others should\r\nobey, as he is the cause of the preservation of all animals; the\r\nregulator of the seasons, the absolute master of the ebb and flow of the\r\nsea, brother to the sun, and king of the four-and-twenty umbrellas!\r\nThese umbrellas are always carried before him as a mark of his dignity.\r\n\r\nThe titles of the kings of Achem are singular, though voluminous. The\r\nmost striking ones are sovereign of the universe, whose body is luminous\r\nas the sun; whom God created to be as accomplished as the moon at her\r\nplenitude; whose eye glitters like the northern star; a king as\r\nspiritual as a ball is round; who when he rises shades all his people;\r\nfrom under whose feet a sweet odour is wafted, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe Kandyan sovereign is called _Dewo_ (God). In a deed of gift he\r\nproclaims his extraordinary attributes. \"The protector of religion,\r\nwhose fame is infinite, and of surpassing excellence, exceeding the\r\nmoon, the unexpanded jessamine buds, the stars, &c.; whose feet are as\r\nfragrant to the noses of other kings as flowers to bees; our most noble\r\npatron and god by custom,\" &c.\r\n\r\nAfter a long enumeration of the countries possessed by the king of\r\nPersia, they give him some poetical distinctions: _the branch of\r\nhonour_; _the mirror of virtue_; and _the rose of delight_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL DIVINITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a curious dissertation in the \"Mémoires de l'Académie des\r\nInscriptions et Belles Lettres,\" by the Abbé Mongault, \"on the divine\r\nhonours which were paid to the governors of provinces during the Roman\r\nrepublic;\" in their lifetime these originally began in gratitude, and at\r\nlength degenerated into flattery. These facts curiously show how far the\r\nhuman mind can advance, when led on by customs that operate\r\nunperceivably on it, and blind us in our absurdities. One of these\r\nceremonies was exquisitely ludicrous. When they voted a statue to a\r\nproconsul, they placed it among the statues of the gods in the festival\r\ncalled _Lectisternium_, from the ridiculous circumstances of this solemn\r\nfestival. On that day the gods were invited to a repast, which was\r\nhowever spread in various quarters of the city, to satiate mouths more\r\nmortal. The gods were however taken down from their pedestals, laid on\r\nbeds ornamented in their temples; pillows were placed under their marble\r\nheads; and while they reposed in this easy posture they were served with\r\na magnificent repast. When Cæsar had conquered Rome, the servile senate\r\nput him to dine with the gods! Fatigued by and ashamed of these honours,\r\nhe desired the senate to erase from his statue in the capitol the title\r\nthey had given him of a _demi-god_!\r\n\r\nThe adulations lavished on the first Roman emperors were extravagant;\r\nbut perhaps few know that they were less offensive than the flatterers\r\nof the third century under the Pagan, and of the fourth under the\r\nChristian emperors. Those who are acquainted with the character of the\r\nage of Augustulus have only to look at the one, and the other _code_, to\r\nfind an infinite number of passages which had not been tolerable even in\r\nthat age. For instance, here is a law of Arcadius and Honorius,\r\npublished in 404:--\r\n\r\n\"Let the officers of the palace be warned to abstain from frequenting\r\ntumultuous meetings; and that those who, instigated by a _sacrilegious_\r\ntemerity, dare to oppose the authority of _our divinity_, shall be\r\ndeprived of their employments, and their estates confiscated.\" The\r\nletters they write are _holy_. When the sons speak of their fathers, it\r\nis, \"Their father of _divine_ memory;\" or \"Their _divine_ father.\" They\r\ncall their own laws _oracles_, and _celestial_ oracles. So also their\r\nsubjects address them by the titles of \"_Your Perpetuity_, _your\r\nEternity._\" And it appears by a law of Theodoric the Great, that the\r\nemperors at length added this to their titles. It begins, \"If any\r\nmagistrate, after having concluded a public work, put his name rather\r\nthan that of _Our Perpetuity_, let him be judged guilty of\r\nhigh-treason.\" All this reminds one of \"the celestial empire\" of the\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\nWhenever the Great Mogul made an observation, Bernier tells us that some\r\nof the first Omrahs lifted up their hands, crying, \"Wonder! wonder!\r\nwonder!\" And a proverb current in his dominion was, \"If the king saith\r\nat noonday it is night, you are to say, Behold the moon and the stars!\"\r\nSuch adulation, however, could not alter the general condition and\r\nfortune of this unhappy being, who became a sovereign without knowing\r\nwhat it is to be one. He was brought out of the seraglio to be placed on\r\nthe throne, and it was he, rather than the spectators, who might have\r\ntruly used the interjection of astonishment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDETHRONED MONARCHS\r\n\r\n\r\nFortune never appears in a more extravagant humour than when she reduces\r\nmonarchs to become mendicants. Half a century ago it was not imagined\r\nthat our own times should have to record many such instances. After\r\nhaving contemplated _kings_ raised into _divinities_, we see them now\r\ndepressed as _beggars_. Our own times, in two opposite senses, may\r\nemphatically be distinguished as the _age of kings_.\r\n\r\nIn Candide, or the Optimist, there is an admirable stroke of Voltaire's.\r\nEight travellers meet in an obscure inn, and some of them with not\r\nsufficient money to pay for a scurvy dinner. In the course of\r\nconversation, they are discovered to be _eight monarchs_ in Europe, who\r\nhad been deprived of their crowns!\r\n\r\nWhat added to this exquisite satire was, that there were eight living\r\nmonarchs at that moment wanderers on the earth;--a circumstance which\r\nhas since occurred!\r\n\r\nAdelaide, the widow of Lothario, king of Italy, one of the most\r\nbeautiful women in her age, was besieged in Pavia by Berenger, who\r\nresolved to constrain her to marry his son after Pavia was taken; she\r\nescaped from her prison with her almoner. The archbishop of Reggio had\r\noffered her an asylum: to reach it, she and her almoner travelled on\r\nfoot through the country by night, concealing herself in the day-time\r\namong the corn, while the almoner begged for alms and food through the\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nThe emperor Henry IV. after having been deposed and imprisoned by his\r\nson, Henry V., escaped from prison; poor, vagrant, and without aid, he\r\nentreated the bishop of Spires to grant him a lay prebend in his church.\r\n\"I have studied,\" said he, \"and have learned to sing, and may therefore\r\nbe of some service to you.\" The request was denied, and he died\r\nmiserably and obscurely at Liege, after having drawn the attention of\r\nEurope to his victories and his grandeur!\r\n\r\nMary of Medicis, the widow of Henry the Great, mother of Louis XIII.,\r\nmother-in-law of three sovereigns, and regent of France, frequently\r\nwanted the necessaries of life, and died at Cologne in the utmost\r\nmisery. The intrigues of Richelieu compelled her to exile herself, and\r\nlive an unhappy fugitive. Her petition exists, with this supplicatory\r\nopening: \"Supplie Marie, Reine de France et de Navarre, disant, que\r\ndepuis le 23 Février elle aurait été arrêtée prisonnière au château de\r\nCompiègne, sans être ni accusée ni soupçonné,\" &c. Lilly, the\r\nastrologer, in his Life and Death of King Charles the First, presents us\r\nwith a melancholy picture of this unfortunate monarch. He has also\r\ndescribed the person of the old queen-mother of France:--\r\n\r\n\"In the month of August, 1641, I beheld the old queen-mother of France\r\ndeparting from London, in company of Thomas, Earl of Arundel. A sad\r\nspectacle of mortality it was, and produced tears from mine eyes and\r\nmany other beholders, to see an aged, lean, decrepit, poor queen, ready\r\nfor her grave, necessitated to depart hence, having no place of\r\nresidence in this world left her, but where the courtesy of her hard\r\nfortune assigned it. She had been the only stately and magnificent woman\r\nof Europe: wife to the greatest king that ever lived in France; mother\r\nunto one king and unto two queens.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1595, died at Paris, Antonio, king of Portugal. His body is\r\ninterred at the Cordeliers, and his heart deposited at the Ave-Maria.\r\nNothing on earth could compel this prince to renounce his crown. He\r\npassed over to England, and Elizabeth assisted him with troops; but at\r\nlength he died in France in great poverty. This dethroned monarch was\r\nhappy in one thing, which is indeed rare: in all his miseries he had a\r\nservant, who proved a tender and faithful friend, and who only desired\r\nto participate in his misfortunes, and to soften his miseries; and for\r\nthe recompense of his services he only wished to be buried at the feet\r\nof his dear master. This hero in loyalty, to whom the ancient Romans\r\nwould have raised altars, was Don Diego Bothei, one of the greatest\r\nlords of the court of Portugal, and who drew his origin from the kings\r\nof Bohemia.\r\n\r\nHume supplies an anecdote of singular royal distress. The queen of\r\nEngland, with her son Charles, \"had a moderate pension assigned her; but\r\nit was so ill paid, and her credit ran so low, that one morning when the\r\nCardinal de Retz waited on her, she informed him that her daughter, the\r\nPrincess Henrietta, was obliged to lie a-bed for want of a fire to warm\r\nher. To such a condition was reduced, in the midst of Paris, a queen of\r\nEngland, and a daughter of Henry IV. of France!\" We find another proof\r\nof her extreme poverty. Salmasius, after publishing his celebrated\r\npolitical book, in favour of Charles I., the _Defensio Regia_, was much\r\nblamed by a friend for not having sent a copy to the widowed queen of\r\nCharles, who, he writes, \"though poor, would yet have paid the bearer.\"\r\n\r\nThe daughter of James the First, who married the Elector Palatine, in\r\nher attempts to get her husband crowned, was reduced to the utmost\r\ndistress, and wandered frequently in disguise.\r\n\r\nA strange anecdote is related of Charles VII. of France. Our Henry V.\r\nhad shrunk his kingdom into the town of Bourges. It is said that having\r\ntold a shoemaker, after he had just tried a pair of his boots, that he\r\nhad no money to pay for them, Crispin had such callous feelings that he\r\nrefused his majesty the boots. \"It is for this reason,\" says Comines, \"I\r\npraise those princes who are on good terms with the lowest of their\r\npeople; for they know not at what hour they may want them.\"\r\n\r\nMany monarchs of this day have experienced more than once the truth of\r\nthe reflection of Comines.\r\n\r\nWe may add here, that in all conquered countries the descendants of\r\nroyal families have been found among the dregs of the populace. An Irish\r\nprince has been discovered in the person of a miserable peasant; and in\r\nMexico, its faithful historian Clavigero notices, that he has known a\r\nlocksmith, who was a descendant of its ancient kings, and a tailor, the\r\nrepresentative of one of its noblest families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEUDAL CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbarous as the feudal customs were, they were the first attempts at\r\norganising European society. The northern nations, in their irruptions\r\nand settlements in Europe, were barbarians independent of each other,\r\ntill a sense of public safety induced these hordes to confederate. But\r\nthe private individual reaped no benefit from the public union; on the\r\ncontrary, he seems to have lost his wild liberty in the subjugation; he\r\nin a short time was compelled to suffer from his chieftain; and the\r\ncuriosity of the philosopher is excited by contemplating in the feudal\r\ncustoms a barbarous people carrying into their first social institutions\r\ntheir original ferocity. The institution of forming cities into\r\ncommunities at length gradually diminished this military and\r\naristocratic tyranny; and the freedom of cities, originating in the\r\npursuits of commerce, shook off the yoke of insolent lordships. A famous\r\necclesiastical writer of that day, who had imbibed the feudal\r\nprejudices, calls these communities, which were distinguished by the\r\nname of _libertates_ (hence probably our municipal term the\r\n_liberties_), as \"execrable inventions, by which, contrary to law and\r\njustice, slaves withdrew themselves from that obedience which they owed\r\nto their masters.\" Such was the expiring voice of aristocratic tyranny!\r\nThis subject has been ingeniously discussed by Robertson in his\r\npreliminary volume to Charles V.; but the following facts constitute the\r\npicture which the historian leaves to be gleaned by the minuter\r\ninquirer.\r\n\r\nThe feudal government introduced a species of servitude which till that\r\ntime was unknown, and which was called the servitude of the land. The\r\nbondmen or serfs, and the villains or country servants, did not reside\r\nin the house of the lord: but they entirely depended on his caprice; and\r\nhe sold them, as he did the animals, with the field where they lived,\r\nand which they cultivated.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive with what insolence the petty lords of those\r\ntimes tyrannized over their villains: they not only oppressed their\r\nslaves with unremitted labour, instigated by a vile cupidity, but their\r\nwhim and caprice led them to inflict miseries without even any motive of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland they had a shameful institution of maiden-rights; and\r\nMalcolm the Third only abolished it, by ordering that they might be\r\nredeemed by a quit-rent. The truth of this circumstance Dalrymple has\r\nattempted, with excusable patriotism, to render doubtful. There seems,\r\nhowever, to be no doubt of the existence of this custom; since it also\r\nspread through Germany, and various parts of Europe; and the French\r\nbarons extended their domestic tyranny to three nights of involuntary\r\nprostitution. Montesquieu is infinitely French, when he could turn this\r\nshameful species of tyranny into a _bon mot_; for he boldly observes on\r\nthis, \"_C'étoit bien ces trois nuits-là, qu'il falloit choisir; car pour\r\nles autres on n'auroit pas donné beaucoup d'argent_.\" The legislator in\r\nthe wit forgot the feelings of his heart.\r\n\r\nOthers, to preserve this privilege when they could not enjoy it in all\r\nits extent, thrust their leg booted into the bed of the new-married\r\ncouple. This was called the _droit de cuisse_. When the bride was in\r\nbed, the esquire or lord performed this ceremony, and stood there, his\r\nthigh in the bed, with a lance in his hand: in this ridiculous attitude\r\nhe remained till he was tired; and the bridegroom was not suffered to\r\nenter the chamber till his lordship had retired. Such indecent\r\nprivileges must have originated in the worst of intentions; and when\r\nafterwards they advanced a step in more humane manners, the ceremonial\r\nwas preserved from avaricious motives. Others have compelled their\r\nsubjects to pass the first night at the top of a tree, and there to\r\nconsummate their marriage; to pass the bridal hours in a river; or to be\r\nbound naked to a cart, and to trace some furrows as they were dragged;\r\nor to leap with their feet tied over the horns of stags.\r\n\r\nSometimes their caprice commanded the bridegroom to appear in drawers at\r\ntheir castle, and plunge into a ditch of mud; and sometimes they were\r\ncompelled to beat the waters of the ponds to hinder the frogs from\r\ndisturbing the lord!\r\n\r\nWardship, or the privilege of guardianship enjoyed by some lords, was\r\none of the barbarous inventions of the feudal ages; the guardian had\r\nboth the care of the person, and for his own use the revenue of the\r\nestates. This feudal custom was so far abused in England, that the king\r\nsold these lordships to strangers; and when the guardian had fixed on a\r\nmarriage for the infant, if the youth or maiden did not agree to this,\r\nthey forfeited the value of the marriage; that is, the sum the guardian\r\nwould have obtained by the other party had it taken place. This cruel\r\ncustom was a source of domestic unhappiness, particularly in\r\nlove-affairs, and has served as the ground-work of many a pathetic play\r\nby our elder dramatists.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the German lords reckoned amongst their privileges\r\nthat of robbing on the highways of their territory; which ended in\r\nraising up the famous Hanseatic Union, to protect their commerce against\r\nrapine and avaricious exactions of toll.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey, lord of Coventry, compelled his wife to ride naked on a white\r\npad through the streets of the town; that by this mode he might restore\r\nto the inhabitants those privileges of which his wantonness had deprived\r\nthem. This anecdote some have suspected to be fictitious, from its\r\nextreme barbarity; but the character of the middle ages will admit of\r\nany kind of wanton barbarism.\r\n\r\nWhen the abbot of Figeac made his entry into that town, the lord of\r\nMontbron, dressed in a harlequin's coat, and one of his legs naked, was\r\ncompelled by an ancient custom to conduct him to the door of his abbey,\r\nleading his horse by the bridle. Blount's \"Jocular Tenures\" is a curious\r\ncollection of such capricious clauses in the grants of their lands.[57]\r\n\r\nThe feudal barons frequently combined to share among themselves those\r\nchildren of their villains who appeared to be the most healthy and\r\nserviceable, or remarkable for their talent; and not unfrequently sold\r\nthem in their markets.\r\n\r\nThe feudal servitude is not, even in the present enlightened times,\r\nabolished in Poland, in Germany, and in Russia. In those countries, the\r\nbondmen are still entirely dependent on the caprice of their masters.\r\nThe peasants of Hungary or Bohemia frequently revolt, and attempt to\r\nshake off the pressure of feudal tyranny.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote of comparatively recent date displays their unfeeling\r\ncaprice. A lord or prince of the northern countries passing through one\r\nof his villages, observed a small assembly of peasants and their\r\nfamilies amusing themselves with dancing. He commands his domestics to\r\npart the men from the women, and confine them in the houses. He orders\r\nthe coats of the women to be drawn up above their heads, and tied with\r\ntheir garters. The men were then liberated, and those who did not\r\nrecognise their wives in that state received a severe castigation.\r\n\r\nAbsolute dominion hardens the human heart; and nobles accustomed to\r\ncommand their bondmen will treat their domestics as slaves, as\r\ncapricious or inhuman West Indians treated their domestic slaves. Those\r\nof Siberia punish theirs by a free use of the cudgel or rod. The Abbé\r\nChappe saw two Russian slaves undress a chambermaid, who had by some\r\ntrifling negligence given offence to her mistress; after having\r\nuncovered as far as her waist, one placed her head betwixt his knees;\r\nthe other held her by the feet; while both, armed with two sharp rods,\r\nviolently lashed her back till it pleased the domestic tyrant to decree\r\n_it was enough_!\r\n\r\nAfter a perusal of these anecdotes of feudal tyranny, we may exclaim\r\nwith Goldsmith--\r\n\r\n    \"I fly from  PETTY TYRANTS--to the THRONE.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hallam's \"State of Europe during the Middle Ages\" renders this short\r\narticle superfluous in a philosophical view.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Many are of the nature of \"peppercorn rents.\" Thus a manor\r\nwas held from the king \"by the service of one rose only, to be paid\r\nyearly, at the feast of St. John the Baptist, for all services; and they\r\ngave the king one penny for the price of the said one rose, as it was\r\nappraised by the barons of the Exchequer.\" Nicholas De Mora, in the\r\nreign of Henry III., \"rendered at the Exchequer two knives, one good,\r\nand the other a very bad one, for certain land which he held in\r\nShropshire.\" The citizens of London still pay to the Exchequer six\r\nhorseshoes with nails, for their right to a piece of ground in the\r\nparish of St. Clement, originally granted to a farrier, as early as the\r\nreign of Henry III.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nGaming appears to be an universal passion. Some have attempted to deny\r\nits universality; they have imagined that it is chiefly prevalent in\r\ncold climates, where such a passion becomes most capable of agitating\r\nand gratifying the torpid minds of their inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe fatal propensity of gaming is to be discovered, as well amongst the\r\ninhabitants of the frigid and torrid zones, as amongst those of the\r\nmilder climates. The savage and the civilized, the illiterate and the\r\nlearned, are alike captivated by the hope of accumulating wealth without\r\nthe labours of industry.\r\n\r\nBarbeyrac has written an elaborate treatise on gaming, and we have two\r\nquarto volumes, by C. Moore, on suicide, gaming, and duelling, which may\r\nbe placed by the side of Barbeyrac. All these works are excellent\r\nsermons; but a sermon to a gambler, a duellist, or a suicide! A\r\ndice-box, a sword, and pistol, are the only things that seem to have any\r\npower over these unhappy men, for ever lost in a labyrinth of their own\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nI am much pleased with the following thought. \"The ancients,\" says the\r\nauthor of _Amusemens Sérieux et Comiques_, \"assembled to see their\r\ngladiators kill one another; they classed this among their _games_! What\r\nbarbarity! But are we less barbarous, we who call a _game_ an\r\nassembly--who meet at the faro table, where the actors themselves\r\nconfess they only meet to destroy one another?\" In both these cases the\r\nphilosopher may perhaps discover their origin in the listless state of\r\n_ennui_ requiring an immediate impulse of the passions, and very\r\ninconsiderate as to the fatal means which procure the desired agitation.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient treatise by a modern on this subject, is said to be by\r\na French physician, one Eckeloo, who published in 1569, _De Aleâ, sive\r\nde curandâ Ludendi in Pecuniam cupiditate_, that is, \"On games of\r\nchance, or a cure for gaming.\" The treatise itself is only worth notice\r\nfrom the circumstance of the author being himself one of the most\r\ninveterate gamblers; he wrote this work to convince himself of this\r\nfolly. But in spite of all his solemn vows, the prayers of his friends,\r\nand his own book perpetually quoted before his face, he was a great\r\ngamester to his last hour! The same circumstance happened to Sir John\r\nDenham, who also published a tract against gaming, and to the last\r\nremained a gamester. They had not the good sense of old Montaigne, who\r\ngives the reason why he gave over gaming. \"I used to like formerly games\r\nof chance with cards and dice; but of that folly I have long been cured;\r\nmerely because I found that whatever good countenance I put on when I\r\nlost, I did not feel my vexation the less.\" Goldsmith fell a victim to\r\nthis madness. To play any game well requires serious study, time, and\r\nexperience. If a literary man plays deeply, he will be duped even by\r\nshallow fellows, as well as by professed gamblers.\r\n\r\n_Dice_, and that little pugnacious animal the _cock_, are the chief\r\ninstruments employed by the numerous nations of the East, to agitate\r\ntheir minds and ruin their fortunes; to which the Chinese, who are\r\ndesperate gamesters, add the use of _cards_. When all other property is\r\nplayed away, the Asiatic gambler scruples not to stake his _wife_ or his\r\n_child_, on the cast of a die, or the courage and strength of a martial\r\nbird. If still unsuccessful, the last venture he stakes is _himself_.\r\n\r\nIn the Island of Ceylon, _cock-fighting_ is carried to a great height.\r\nThe Sumatrans are addicted to the use of dice. A strong spirit of play\r\ncharacterises a Malayan. After having resigned everything to the good\r\nfortune of the winner, he is reduced to a horrid state of desperation;\r\nhe then loosens a certain lock of hair, which indicates war and\r\ndestruction to all whom the raving gamester meets. He intoxicates\r\nhimself with opium; and working himself into a fit of frenzy, he bites\r\nor kills every one who comes in his way. But as soon as this lock is\r\nseen flowing, it is _lawful_ to fire at the person and to destroy him\r\nas fast as possible. This custom is what is called \"To run a muck.\" Thus\r\nDryden writes--\r\n\r\n    \"Frontless and satire-proof, he scours the streets,\r\n    And _runs_ an Indian _muck_ at all he meets.\"\r\n\r\nThus also Pope--\r\n\r\n    \"Satire's my weapon, but =I'm= too discreet\r\n    To _run a muck_, and tilt at all I meet.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson could not discover the derivation of the word _muck_. To \"run a\r\nmuck\" is an old phrase for attacking madly and indiscriminately; and has\r\nsince been ascertained to be a Malay word.\r\n\r\nTo discharge their gambling debts, the Siamese sell their possessions,\r\ntheir families, and at length themselves. The Chinese play _night_ and\r\n_day_, till they have lost all they are worth; and then they usually go\r\nand hang themselves. Such is the propensity of the Javanese for high\r\nplay, that they were compelled to make a law, that \"Whoever ventures his\r\nmoney at play shall be put to death.\" In the newly-discovered islands of\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, they venture even their hatchets, which they hold as\r\ninvaluable acquisitions, on running-matches.--\"We saw a man,\" says Cook,\r\n\"beating his breast and tearing his hair in the violence of rage, for\r\nhaving lost three hatchets at one of these races, and which he had\r\npurchased with nearly half his property.\"\r\n\r\nThe ancient nations were not less addicted to gaming: Persians,\r\nGrecians, and Romans; the Goths, and Germans. To notice the modern ones\r\nwere a melancholy task: there is hardly a family in Europe which cannot\r\nrecord, from their own domestic annals, the dreadful prevalence of this\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n_Gamester_ and _cheater_ were synonymous terms in the time of Shakspeare\r\nand Jonson: they have hardly lost much of their double signification in\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nThe following is a curious picture of a gambling-house, from a\r\ncontemporary account, and appears to be an establishment more systematic\r\neven than the \"Hells\" of the present day.\r\n\r\n\"A list of the officers established in the most notorious\r\ngaming-houses,\" from the DAILY JOURNAL, Jan. 9th, 1731.\r\n\r\n1st.

It is diffuse in style, and\r\nhence looks a little like a \"bookseller's job,\" of which the most was to\r\nbe made; but the same fault has characterised many works whose authors\r\npossess a bad style. Many of the tales narrated of well-known London\r\ncharacters of the \"merry days\" of Charles the Second are very\r\ncharacteristic, and are not to be met with elsewhere.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARABIC CHRONICLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Arabic chronicle is only valuable from the time of Mahomet. For such\r\nis the stupid superstition of the Arabs, that they pride themselves on\r\nbeing ignorant of whatever has passed before the mission of their\r\nProphet. The Arabic chronicle of Jerusalem contains the most curious\r\ninformation concerning the crusades: Longuerue translated several\r\nportions of this chronicle, which appears to be written with\r\nimpartiality. It renders justice to the Christian heroes, and\r\nparticularly dwells on the gallant actions of the Count de St. Gilles.\r\n\r\nOur historians chiefly write concerning _Godfrey de Bouillon_; only the\r\nlearned know that the Count _de St. Gilles_ acted there so important a\r\ncharacter. The stories of the _Saracens_ are just the reverse; they\r\nspeak little concerning Godfrey, and eminently distinguish Saint Gilles.\r\n\r\nTasso has given in to the more vulgar accounts, by making the former so\r\neminent, at the cost of the other heroes, in his Jerusalem Delivered.\r\nThus Virgil transformed by his magical power the chaste Dido into a\r\ndistracted lover; and Homer the meretricious Penelope into a moaning\r\nmatron. It is not requisite for poets to be historians, but historians\r\nshould not be so frequently poets. The same charge, I have been told,\r\nmust be made against the Grecian historians. The Persians are viewed to\r\ngreat disadvantage in Grecian history. It would form a curious inquiry,\r\nand the result might be unexpected to some, were the Oriental student to\r\ncomment on the Grecian historians. The Grecians were not the demi-gods\r\nthey paint themselves to have been, nor those they attacked the\r\ncontemptible multitudes they describe. These boasted victories might be\r\ndiminished. The same observation attaches to Cæsar's account of his\r\nBritish expedition. He never records the defeats he frequently\r\nexperienced. The national prejudices of the Roman historians have\r\nundoubtedly occasioned us to have a very erroneous conception of the\r\nCarthaginians, whose discoveries in navigation and commercial\r\nenterprises were the most considerable among the ancients. We must\r\nindeed think highly of that people, whose works on agriculture, which\r\nthey had raised into a science, the senate of Rome ordered to be\r\ntranslated into Latin. They must indeed have been a wise and grave\r\npeople.--Yet they are stigmatised by the Romans for faction, cruelty,\r\nand cowardice; and the \"Punic\" faith has come down to us in a proverb:\r\nbut Livy was a Roman! and there is such a thing as a patriotic\r\nmalignity!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEMPSYCHOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we except the belief of a future remuneration beyond this life for\r\nsuffering virtue, and retribution for successful crimes, there is no\r\nsystem so simple, and so little repugnant to our understanding, as that\r\nof the metempsychosis. The pains and the pleasures of this life are by\r\nthis system considered as the recompense or the punishment of our\r\nactions in an anterior state: so that, says St. Foix, we cease to wonder\r\nthat, among men and animals, some enjoy an easy and agreeable life,\r\nwhile others seem born only to suffer all kinds of miseries.\r\nPreposterous as this system may appear, it has not wanted for advocates\r\nin the present age, which indeed has revived every kind of fanciful\r\ntheory. Mercier, in _L'an deux mille quatre cents quarante_, seriously\r\nmaintains the present one.\r\n\r\nIf we seek for the origin of the opinion of the metempsychosis, or the\r\ntransmigration of souls into other bodies, we must plunge into the\r\nremotest antiquity; and even then we shall find it impossible to fix the\r\nepoch of its first author. The notion was long extant in Greece before\r\nthe time of Pythagoras. Herodotus assures us that the Egyptian priests\r\ntaught it; but he does not inform us of the time it began to spread. It\r\nprobably followed the opinion of the immortality of the soul. As soon as\r\nthe first philosophers had established this dogma, they thought they\r\ncould not maintain this immortality without a transmigration of souls.\r\nThe opinion of the metempsychosis spread in almost every region of the\r\nearth; and it continues, even to the present time, in all its force\r\namongst those nations who have not yet embraced Christianity. The people\r\nof Arracan, Peru, Siam, Camboya, Tonquin, Cochin-China, Japan, Java, and\r\nCeylon still entertain that fancy, which also forms the chief article of\r\nthe Chinese religion. The Druids believed in transmigration. The bardic\r\ntriads of the Welsh are full of this belief; and a Welsh antiquary\r\ninsists, that by an emigration which formerly took place, it was\r\nconveyed to the Bramins of India from Wales! The Welsh bards tell us\r\nthat the souls of men transmigrate into the bodies of those animals\r\nwhose habits and characters they most resemble, till after a circuit of\r\nsuch penitential miseries, they are purified for the celestial presence;\r\nfor man may be converted into a pig or a wolf, till at length he assumes\r\nthe inoffensiveness of the dove.\r\n\r\nMy learned friend Sharon Turner has explained, in his \"Vindication of\r\nthe ancient British Poems,\" p. 231, the Welsh system of the\r\nmetempsychosis. Their bards mention three circles of existence. The\r\ncircle of the all-enclosing circle holds nothing alive or dead, but God.\r\nThe second circle, that of felicity, is that which men are to pervade\r\nafter they have passed through their terrestrial changes. The circle of\r\nevil is that in which human nature passes through those varying stages\r\nof existence which it must undergo before it is qualified to inhabit the\r\ncircle of felicity.\r\n\r\nThe progression of man through the circle of evil is marked by three\r\ninfelicities: Necessity, oblivion, and deaths. The deaths which follow\r\nour changes are so many escapes from their power. Man is a free agent,\r\nand has the liberty of choosing; his sufferings and changes cannot be\r\nforeseen. By his misconduct he may happen to fall retrograde into the\r\nlowest state from which he had emerged. If his conduct in any one state,\r\ninstead of improving his being, had made it worse, he fell back into a\r\nworse condition, to commence again his purifying revolutions. Humanity\r\nwas the limit of the degraded transmigrations. All the changes above\r\nhumanity produced felicity. Humanity is the scene of the contest; and\r\nafter man has traversed every state of animated existence, and can\r\nremember all that he has passed through, that consummation follows which\r\nhe attains in the circle of felicity. It is on this system of\r\ntransmigration that Taliessin, the Welsh bard, who wrote in the sixth\r\ncentury, gives a recital of his pretended transmigrations. He tells how\r\nhe had been a serpent, a wild ass, a buck, or a crane, &c.; and this\r\nkind of reminiscence of his former state, this recovery of memory, was a\r\nproof of the mortal's advances to the happier circle. For to forget what\r\nwe have been was one of the curses of the circle of evil. Taliessin,\r\ntherefore, adds Mr. Turner, as profusely boasts of his recovered\r\nreminiscence as any modern sectary can do of his state of grace and\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nIn all these wild reveries there seems to be a moral fable in the\r\nnotion, that the clearer a man recollects what a _brute_ he has been, it\r\nis a certain proof that he is in an improved state!\r\n\r\nAccording to the authentic Clavigero, in his history of Mexico, we find\r\nthe Pythagorean transmigration carried on in the West, and not less\r\nfancifully than in the countries of the East. The people of Tlascala\r\nbelieve that the souls of persons of rank went after their death to\r\ninhabit the bodies of _beautiful and sweet singing birds_, and those of\r\nthe _nobler quadrupeds_; while the souls of inferior persons were\r\nsupposed to pass into _weasels_, _beetles_, and such other _meaner\r\nanimals_.\r\n\r\nThere is something not a little ludicrous in the description Plutarch\r\ngives at the close of his treatise on \"the delay of heavenly justice.\"\r\nThespesius saw at length the souls of those who were condemned to return\r\nto life, and whom they violently forced to take the forms of all kinds\r\nof animals. The labourers charged with this transformation forged with\r\ntheir instruments certain parts; others, a new form; and made some\r\ntotally disappear; that these souls might be rendered proper for another\r\nkind of life and other habits. Among these he perceived the soul of\r\nNero, which had already suffered long torments, and which stuck to the\r\nbody by nails red from the fire. The workmen seized on him to make a\r\nviper of, under which form he was now to live, after having devoured the\r\nbreast that had carried him.--But in this Plutarch only copies the fine\r\nreveries of Plato.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH ETIQUETTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe etiquette, or rules to be observed in royal palaces, is necessary\r\nfor keeping order at court. In Spain it was carried to such lengths as\r\nto make martyrs of their kings. Here is an instance, at which, in spite\r\nof the fatal consequences it produced, one cannot refrain from smiling.\r\n\r\nPhilip the Third was gravely seated by the fire-side: the fire-maker of\r\nthe court had kindled so great a quantity of wood, that the monarch was\r\nnearly suffocated with heat, and his _grandeur_ would not suffer him to\r\nrise from the chair; the domestics could not _presume_ to enter the\r\napartment, because it was against the _etiquette_. At length the Marquis\r\nde Potat appeared, and the king ordered him to damp the fire; but _he_\r\nexcused himself; alleging that he was forbidden by the _etiquette_ to\r\nperform such a function, for which the Duke d'Ussada ought to be called\r\nupon, as it was his business. The duke was gone out: the _fire_ burnt\r\nfiercer; and the _king_ endured it, rather than derogate from his\r\n_dignity_. But his blood was heated to such a degree, that an erysipelas\r\nof the head appeared the next day, which, succeeded by a violent fever,\r\ncarried him off in 1621, in the twenty-fourth year of his reign.\r\n\r\nThe palace was once on fire; a soldier, who knew the king's sister was\r\nin her apartment, and must inevitably have been consumed in a few\r\nmoments by the flames, at the risk of his life rushed in, and brought\r\nher highness safe out in his arms: but the Spanish _etiquette_ was here\r\nwofully broken into! The loyal soldier was brought to trial; and as it\r\nwas impossible to deny that he had entered her apartment, the judges\r\ncondemned him to die! The Spanish Princess however condescended, in\r\nconsideration of the circumstance, to _pardon_ the soldier, and very\r\nbenevolently saved his life.\r\n\r\nWhen Isabella, mother of Philip II., was ready to be delivered of him,\r\nshe commanded that all the lights should be extinguished: that if the\r\nviolence of her pain should occasion her face to change colour, no one\r\nmight perceive it. And when the midwife said, \"Madam, cry out, that will\r\ngive you ease,\" she answered in _good Spanish_, \"How dare you give me\r\nsuch advice? I would rather die than cry out.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Spain gives us _pride_--which Spain to all the earth\r\n    May largely give, nor fear herself a dearth!\"--_Churchill._\r\n\r\nPhilip the Third was a weak bigot, who suffered himself to be governed\r\nby his ministers. A patriot wished to open his eyes, but he could not\r\npierce through the crowds of his flatterers; besides that the voice of\r\npatriotism heard in a corrupted court would have become a crime never\r\npardoned. He found, however, an ingenious manner of conveying to him his\r\ncensure. He caused to be laid on his table, one day, a letter sealed,\r\nwhich bore this address--\"To the King of Spain, Philip the Third, at\r\npresent in the service of the Duke of Lerma.\"\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, Don Carlos, son to Philip the Second, made a book\r\nwith empty pages, to contain the voyages of his father, which bore this\r\ntitle--\"The great and admirable Voyages of the King Mr. Philip.\" All\r\nthese voyages consisted in going to the Escurial from Madrid, and\r\nreturning to Madrid from the Escurial. Jests of this kind at length cost\r\nhim his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOTHS AND HUNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terrific honours which these ferocious nations paid to their\r\ndeceased monarchs are recorded in history, by the interment of Attila,\r\nking of the Huns, and Alaric, king of the Goths.\r\n\r\nAttila died in 453, and was buried in the midst of a vast champaign in a\r\ncoffin which was inclosed in one of gold, another of silver, and a third\r\nof iron. With the body were interred all the spoils of the enemy,\r\nharnesses embroidered with gold and studded with jewels, rich silks, and\r\nwhatever they had taken most precious in the palaces of the kings they\r\nhad pillaged; and that the place of his interment might for ever remain\r\nconcealed, the Huns deprived of life all who assisted at his burial!\r\n\r\nThe Goths had done nearly the same for Alaric in 410, at Cosença, a town\r\nin Calabria. They turned aside the river Vasento; and having formed a\r\ngrave in the midst of its bed where its course was most rapid, they\r\ninterred this king with prodigious accumulations of riches. After having\r\ncaused the river to reassume its usual course, they murdered, without\r\nexception, all those who had been concerned in digging this singular\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICARS OF BRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vicar of Bray, in Berkshire, was a papist under the reign of Henry\r\nthe Eighth, and a Protestant under Edward the Sixth; he was a papist\r\nagain under Mary, and once more became a Protestant in the reign of\r\nElizabeth.[59] When this scandal to the gown was reproached for his\r\nversatility of religious creeds, and taxed for being a turncoat and an\r\ninconstant changeling, as Fuller expresses it, he replied, \"Not so\r\nneither; for if I changed my religion, I am sure I kept true to my\r\nprinciple; which is, to live and die the vicar of Bray!\"\r\n\r\nThis vivacious and reverend hero has given birth to a proverb peculiar\r\nto this county, \"The vicar of Bray will be vicar of Bray still.\" But how\r\nhas it happened that this _vicar_ should be so notorious, and one in\r\nmuch higher rank, acting the same part, should have escaped notice? Dr.\r\n_Kitchen_, bishop of Llandaff, from an idle abbot under Henry VIII. was\r\nmade a busy bishop; Protestant under Edward, he returned to his old\r\nmaster under Mary; and at last took the oath of supremacy under\r\nElizabeth, and finished as a parliament Protestant. A pun spread the\r\nodium of his name; for they said that he had always loved the _Kitchen_\r\nbetter than the _Church_!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: His name was Simon Symonds. The popular ballad absurdly\r\nexaggerates his deeds, and gives them untrue amplitude. It is not older\r\nthan the last century, and is printed in Ritson's _English Songs_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be recorded as a species of Puritanic barbarism, that no later\r\nthan the year 1757, a man of genius was persecuted because he had\r\nwritten a tragedy which tended by no means to hurt the morals; but, on\r\nthe contrary, by awakening the piety of domestic affections with the\r\nnobler passions, would rather elevate and purify the mind.\r\n\r\nWhen Home, the author of the tragedy of Douglas, had it performed at\r\nEdinburgh, some of the divines, his acquaintance, attending the\r\nrepresentation, the clergy, with the monastic spirit of the darkest\r\nages, published a paper, which I abridge for the contemplation of the\r\nreader, who may wonder to see such a composition written in the\r\neighteenth century.\"\r\n\r\n\"On Wednesday, February the 2nd, 1757, the Presbytery of Glasgow came to\r\nthe following resolution. They having seen a printed paper, intituled,\r\n'An admonition and exhortation of the reverend Presbytery of Edinburgh;'\r\nwhich, among other _evils_ prevailing, observing the following\r\n_melancholy_ but _notorious_ facts: that one who is a minister of the\r\nchurch of Scotland did _himself_ write and compose _a stage-play_,\r\nintituled, 'The tragedy of Douglas,' and got it to be acted at the\r\ntheatre of Edinburgh; and that he with several other ministers of the\r\nchurch were present; and _some_ of them _oftener than once_, at the\r\nacting of the said play before a numerous audience. The presbytery being\r\n_deeply affected_ with this new and strange appearance, do publish these\r\nsentiments,\" &c Sentiments with which I will not disgust the reader;\r\nbut which they appear not yet to have purified and corrected, as they\r\nhave shown in the case of Logan and other Scotchmen, who have committed\r\nthe crying sin of composing dramas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICAL HISTORY OF POVERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Morin, in the Memoirs of the French Academy, has formed a little\r\nhistory of Poverty, which I abridge.\r\n\r\nThe writers on the genealogies of the gods have not noticed the deity of\r\nPoverty, though admitted as such in the pagan heaven, while she has had\r\ntemples and altars on earth. The allegorical Plato has pleasingly\r\nnarrated, that at the feast which Jupiter gave on the birth of Venus,\r\nPoverty modestly stood at the gate of the palace to gather the fragments\r\nof the celestial banquet; when she observed the god of riches,\r\ninebriated with nectar, roll out of the heavenly residence, and passing\r\ninto the Olympian Gardens, throw himself on a vernal bank. She seized\r\nthis opportunity to become familiar with the god. The frolicsome deity\r\nhonoured her with his caresses; and from this amour sprung the god of\r\nLove, who resembles his father in jollity and mirth, and his mother in\r\nhis nudity. The allegory is ingenious. The union of poverty with riches\r\nmust inevitably produce the most delightful of pleasures.\r\n\r\nThe golden age, however, had but the duration of a flower; when it\r\nfinished, Poverty began to appear. The ancestors of the human race, if\r\nthey did not meet her face to face, knew her in a partial degree; the\r\nvagrant Cain encountered her. She was firmly established in the\r\npatriarchal age. We hear of merchants who publicly practised the\r\ncommerce of vending slaves, which indicates the utmost degree of\r\npoverty. She is distinctly marked by Job: this holy man protests, that\r\nhe had nothing to reproach himself with respecting the poor, for he had\r\nassisted them in their necessities.\r\n\r\nIn the scriptures, legislators paid great attention to their relief.\r\nMoses, by his wise precautions, endeavoured to soften the rigours of\r\nthis unhappy state. The division of lands, by tribes and families; the\r\nseptennial jubilees; the regulation to bestow at the harvest-time a\r\ncertain portion of all the fruits of the earth for those families who\r\nwere in want; and the obligation of his moral law to love one's\r\nneighbour as one's self; were so many mounds erected against the\r\ninundations of poverty. The Jews under their Theocracy had few or no\r\nmendicants. Their kings were unjust; and rapaciously seizing on\r\ninheritances which were not their right, increased the numbers of the\r\npoor. From the reign of David there were oppressive governors, who\r\ndevoured the people as their bread. It was still worse under the foreign\r\npowers of Babylon, of Persia, and the Roman emperors. Such were the\r\nextortions of their publicans, and the avarice of their governors, that\r\nthe number of mendicants dreadfully augmented; and it was probably for\r\nthat reason that the opulent families consecrated a tenth part of their\r\nproperty for their succour, as appears in the time of the evangelists.\r\nIn the preceding ages no more was given, as their casuists assure us,\r\nthan the fortieth or thirtieth part; a custom which this singular nation\r\nstill practise. If there are no poor of their nation where they reside,\r\nthey send it to the most distant parts. The Jewish merchants make this\r\ncharity a regular charge in their transactions with each other; and at\r\nthe close of the year render an account to the poor of their nation.\r\n\r\nBy the example of Moses, the ancient legislators were taught to pay a\r\nsimilar attention to the poor. Like him, they published laws respecting\r\nthe division of lands; and many ordinances were made for the benefit of\r\nthose whom fires, inundations, wars, or bad harvests had reduced to\r\nwant. Convinced that _idleness_ more inevitably introduced poverty than\r\nany other cause, it was rigorously punished; the Egyptians made it\r\ncriminal, and no vagabonds or mendicants were suffered under any\r\npretence whatever. Those who were convicted of slothfulness, and still\r\nrefused to labour for the public when labour was offered to them, were\r\npunished with death. The famous Pyramids are the works of men who\r\notherwise had remained vagabonds and mendicants.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit inspired Greece. Lycurgus would not have in his republic\r\neither _poor_ or _rich_: they lived and laboured in common. As in the\r\npresent times, every family has its stores and cellars, so they had\r\npublic ones, and distributed the provisions according to the ages and\r\nconstitutions of the people. If the same regulation was not precisely\r\nobserved by the Athenians, the Corinthians, and the other people of\r\nGreece, the same maxim existed in full force against idleness.\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws of Draco, Solon, &c., a conviction of wilful\r\npoverty was punished with the loss of life. Plato, more gentle in his\r\nmanners, would have them only banished. He calls them enemies of the\r\nstate; and pronounces as a maxim, that where there are great numbers of\r\nmendicants, fatal revolutions will happen; for as these people have\r\nnothing to lose, they plan opportunities to disturb the public repose.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Romans, whose universal object was the public prosperity,\r\nwere not indebted to Greece on this head. One of the principal\r\noccupations of their censors was to keep a watch on the vagabonds. Those\r\nwho were condemned as incorrigible sluggards were sent to the mines, or\r\nmade to labour on the public edifices. The Romans of those times, unlike\r\nthe present race, did not consider the _far niente_ as an occupation;\r\nthey were convinced that their liberalities were ill-placed in bestowing\r\nthem on such men. The little republics of the _bees_ and the _ants_ were\r\noften held out as an example; and the last particularly, where Virgil\r\nsays, that they have elected overseers who correct the sluggards:\r\n\r\n    \"---- Pars agmina cogunt,\r\n    Castigantque moras.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if we may trust the narratives of our travellers, the _beavers_\r\npursue this regulation more rigorously and exactly than even these\r\nindustrious societies. But their rigour, although but animals, is not so\r\nbarbarous as that of the ancient Germans; who, Tacitus informs us,\r\nplunged the idlers and vagabonds in the thickest mire of their marshes,\r\nand left them to perish by a kind of death which resembled their\r\ninactive dispositions.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, it was not inhumanity that prompted the ancients thus\r\nseverely to chastise idleness; they were induced to it by a strict\r\nequity, and it would be doing them injustice to suppose, that it was\r\nthus they treated those _unfortunate poor_, whose indigence was\r\noccasioned by infirmities, by age, or unforeseen calamities. Every\r\nfamily constantly assisted its branches to save them from being reduced\r\nto beggary; which to them appeared worse than death. The magistrates\r\nprotected those who were destitute of friends, or incapable of labour.\r\nWhen Ulysses was disguised as a mendicant, and presented himself to\r\nEurymachus, this prince observing him, to be robust and healthy, offered\r\nto give him employment, or otherwise to leave him to his ill fortune.\r\nWhen the Roman Emperors, even in the reigns of Nero and Tiberius,\r\nbestowed their largesses, the distributors were ordered to exempt those\r\nfrom receiving a share whose bad conduct kept them in misery; for that\r\nit was better the lazy should die with hunger than be fed in idleness.\r\n\r\nWhether the police of the ancients was more exact, or whether they were\r\nmore attentive to practise the duties of humanity, or that slavery\r\nserved as an efficacious corrective of idleness; it clearly appears how\r\nsmall was the misery, and how few the numbers of their poor. This they\r\ndid, too, without having recourse to hospitals.\r\n\r\nAt the establishment of Christianity, when the apostles commanded a\r\ncommunity of wealth among their disciples, the miseries of the poor\r\nbecame alleviated in a greater degree. If they did not absolutely live\r\ntogether, as we have seen religious orders, yet the wealthy continually\r\nsupplied their distressed brethren: but matters greatly changed under\r\nConstantine. This prince published edicts in favour of those Christians\r\nwho had been condemned in the preceding reigns to slavery, to the mines,\r\nto the galleys, or prisons. The church felt an inundation of prodigious\r\ncrowds of these miserable men, who brought with them urgent wants and\r\ncorporeal infirmities. The Christian families were then not numerous;\r\nthey could not satisfy these claimants. The magistrates protected them:\r\nthey built spacious hospitals, under different titles, for the sick, the\r\naged, the invalids, the widows, and orphans. The emperors, and the most\r\neminent personages, were seen in these hospitals, examining the\r\npatients; they assisted the helpless; they dressed the wounded. This did\r\nso much honour to the new religion, that Julian the Apostate introduced\r\nthis custom among the pagans. But the best things are continually\r\nperverted.\r\n\r\nThese retreats were found insufficient. Many slaves, proud of the\r\nliberty they had just recovered, looked on them as prisons; and, under\r\nvarious pretexts, wandered about the country. They displayed with art\r\nthe scars of their former wounds, and exposed the imprinted marks of\r\ntheir chains. They found thus a lucrative profession in begging, which\r\nhad been interdicted by the laws. The profession did not finish with\r\nthem: men of an untoward, turbulent, and licentious disposition, gladly\r\nembraced it. It spread so wide that the succeeding emperors were obliged\r\nto institute new laws; and individuals were allowed to seize on these\r\nmendicants for their slaves and perpetual vassals: a powerful\r\npreservative against this disorder. It is observed in almost every part\r\nof the world but ours; and prevents that populace of beggary which\r\ndisgraces Europe. China presents us with a noble example. No beggars are\r\nseen loitering in that country. All the world are occupied, even to the\r\nblind and the lame; and only those who are incapable of labour live at\r\nthe public expense. What is done _there_ may also be performed _here_.\r\nInstead of that hideous, importunate, idle, licentious poverty, as\r\npernicious to the police as to morality, we should see the poverty of\r\nthe earlier ages, humble, modest, frugal, robust, industrious, and\r\nlaborious. Then, indeed, the fable of Plato might be realised: Poverty\r\nmight be embraced by the god of Riches; and if she did not produce the\r\nvoluptuous offspring of Love, she would become the fertile mother of\r\nAgriculture, and the ingenious parent of the Arts and Manufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLOMON AND SHEBA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Rabbin once told me an ingenious invention, which in the Talmud is\r\nattributed to Solomon.\r\n\r\nThe power of the monarch had spread his wisdom to the remotest parts of\r\nthe known world. Queen Sheba, attracted by the splendour of his\r\nreputation, visited this poetical king at his own court; there, one day\r\nto exercise the sagacity of the monarch, Sheba presented herself at the\r\nfoot of the throne: in each hand she held a wreath; the one was composed\r\nof natural, and the other of artificial, flowers. Art, in the labour of\r\nthe mimetic wreath, had exquisitely emulated the lively hues of nature;\r\nso that, at the distance it was held by the queen for the inspection of\r\nthe king, it was deemed impossible for him to decide, as her question\r\nimported, which wreath was the production of nature, and which the work\r\nof art. The sagacious Solomon seemed perplexed; yet to be vanquished,\r\nthough in a trifle, by a trifling woman, irritated his pride. The son of\r\nDavid, he who had written treatises on the vegetable productions \"from\r\nthe cedar to the hyssop,\" to acknowledge himself outwitted by a woman,\r\nwith shreds of paper and glazed paintings! The honour of the monarch's\r\nreputation for divine sagacity seemed diminished, and the whole Jewish\r\ncourt looked solemn and melancholy. At length an expedient presented\r\nitself to the king; and one it must be confessed worthy of the\r\nnaturalist. Observing a cluster of bees hovering about a window, he\r\ncommanded that it should be opened: it was opened; the bees rushed into\r\nthe court, and alighted immediately on one of the wreaths, while not a\r\nsingle one fixed on the other. The baffled Sheba had one more reason to\r\nbe astonished at the wisdom of Solomon.\r\n\r\nThis would make a pretty poetical tale. It would yield an elegant\r\ndescription, and a pleasing moral; that _the bee_ only _rests_ on the\r\nnatural beauties, and never _fixes_ on the _painted flowers_, however\r\ninimitably the colours may be laid on. Applied to the _ladies_, this\r\nwould give it pungency. In the \"Practical Education\" of the Edgeworths,\r\nthe reader will find a very ingenious conversation founded on this\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOldham, in his \"Satires upon the Jesuits,\" a work which would admit of a\r\ncurious commentary, alludes to their \"lying legends,\" and the\r\ninnumerable impositions they practised on the credulous. I quote a few\r\nlines in which he has collected some of those legendary miracles, which\r\nI have noticed in the article LEGENDS, and the amours of the Virgin Mary\r\nare detailed in that on RELIGIOUS NOUVELLETTES.\r\n\r\n    Tell, how _blessed Virgin_ to come down was seen,\r\n    Like play-house punk descending in machine,\r\n    How she writ _billet-doux_ and _love-discourse_,\r\n    Made _assignations_, _visits_, and _amours_;\r\n    How hosts distrest, her _smock_ for _banner_ wore,\r\n    Which vanquished foes!\r\n    ---- how _fish_ in conventicles met,\r\n    And _mackerel_ were with _bait of doctrine_ caught:\r\n    How cattle have judicious hearers been!--\r\n    How _consecrated hives_ with bells were hung,\r\n    And _bees_ kept mass, and holy _anthems sung_!\r\n    How _pigs_ to th' _rosary_ kneel'd, and _sheep_ were taught\r\n    To bleat _Te Deum_ and _Magnificat_;\r\n    How _fly-flap_, of church-censure houses rid\r\n    Of insects, which at _curse of fryar_ died.\r\n    How _ferrying cowls_ religious pilgrims bore\r\n    O'er waves, without the help of sail or oar;\r\n    How _zealous crab_ the _sacred image_ bore,\r\n    And swam a catholic to the distant shore.\r\n    With shams like these the giddy rout mislead,\r\n    Their folly and their superstition feed.\r\n\r\nAll these are allusions to the extravagant fictions in the \"Golden\r\nLegend.\" Among other gross impositions to deceive the mob, Oldham\r\nlikewise attacks them for certain publications on topics not less\r\nsingular. The tales he has recounted, Oldham says, are only baits for\r\nchildren, like toys at a fair; but they have their profounder and higher\r\nmatters for the learned and inquisitive. He goes on:--\r\n\r\n    One undertakes by scales of miles to tell\r\n    The bounds, dimensions, and extent of HELL;\r\n    How many German leagues that realm contains!\r\n    How many chaldrons Hell each year expends\r\n    In coals for roasting Hugonots and friends!\r\n    Another frights the rout with useful stories\r\n    Of wild chimeras, limbos--PURGATORIES--\r\n    Where bloated souls in smoky durance hung,\r\n    Like a Westphalia gammon or neat's tongue,\r\n    To be redeem'd with masses and a song.--SATIRE IV.\r\n\r\nThe readers of Oldham, for Oldham must ever have readers among the\r\ncurious in our poetry, have been greatly disappointed in the pompous\r\nedition of a Captain Thompson, which illustrates none of his allusions.\r\nIn the above lines Oldham alludes to some singular works.\r\n\r\nTreatises and topographical descriptions of HELL, PURGATORY, and even\r\nHEAVEN, were once the favourite researches among certain zealous\r\ndefenders of the Romish Church, who exhausted their ink-horns in\r\nbuilding up a Hell to their own taste, or for their particular\r\npurpose.[60] We have a treatise of Cardinal Bellarmin, a Jesuit, on\r\n_Purgatory_; he seems to have the science of a surveyor among all the\r\nsecret tracks and the formidable divisions of \"the bottomless pit.\"\r\n\r\nBellarmin informs us that there are beneath the earth four different\r\nplaces, or a profound place divided into four parts. The deepest of\r\nthese places is _Hell_; it contains all the souls of the damned, where\r\nwill be also their bodies after the resurrection, and likewise all the\r\ndemons. The place nearest _Hell_ is _Purgatory_, where souls are purged,\r\nor rather where they appease the anger of God by their sufferings. He\r\nsays that the same fires and the same torments are alike in both these\r\nplaces, the only difference between _Hell_ and _Purgatory_ consisting in\r\ntheir duration. Next to _Purgatory_ is the _limbo_ of those _infants_\r\nwho die without having received the sacrament; and the fourth place is\r\nthe _limbo_ of the _Fathers_; that is to say, of those _just men_ who\r\ndied before the death of Christ. But since the days of the Redeemer,\r\nthis last division is empty, like an apartment to be let. A later\r\ncatholic theologist, the famous Tillemont, condemns _all the illustrious\r\npagans_ to the _eternal torments of Hell_? because they lived before the\r\ntime of Jesus, and therefore could not be benefited by the redemption!\r\nSpeaking of young Tiberius, who was compelled to fall on his own sword,\r\nTillemont adds, \"Thus by his own hand he ended his miserable life, _to\r\nbegin another, the misery of which will never end_!\" Yet history records\r\nnothing bad of this prince. Jortin observes that he added this\r\n_reflection_ in his later edition, so that the good man as he grew older\r\ngrew more uncharitable in his religious notions. It is in this manner\r\ntoo that the Benedictine editor of Justin Martyr speaks of the\r\nillustrious pagans. This father, after highly applauding Socrates, and a\r\nfew more who resembled him, inclines to think that they are not fixed in\r\n_Hell_. But the Benedictine editor takes great pains to clear the good\r\nfather from the shameful imputation of supposing that a _virtuous pagan\r\nmight be saved_ as well as a Benedictine monk! For a curious specimen of\r\nthis _odium theologicum_, see the \"Censure\" of the Sorbonne on\r\nMarmontel's Belisarius.\r\n\r\nThe adverse party, who were either philosophers or reformers, received\r\nall such information with great suspicion. Anthony Cornelius, a lawyer\r\nin the sixteenth century, wrote a small tract, which was so effectually\r\nsuppressed, as a monster of atheism, that a copy is now only to be found\r\nin the hands of the curious. This author ridiculed the absurd and horrid\r\ndoctrine of _infant damnation_, and was instantly decried as an atheist,\r\nand the printer prosecuted to his ruin! Cælius Secundus Curio, a noble\r\nItalian, published a treatise _De Amplitudine beati Regni Dei_, to prove\r\nthat _Heaven_ has more inhabitants than _Hell_,--or, in his own phrase,\r\nthat the _elect_ are more numerous than the _reprobate_. However we may\r\nincline to smile at these works, their design was benevolent. They were\r\nthe first streaks of the morning light of the Reformation. Even such\r\nworks assisted mankind to examine more closely, and hold in greater\r\ncontempt, the extravagant and pernicious doctrines of the domineering\r\npapistical church.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: One of the most horrible of these books was the work of\r\nthe Jesuit Pinamonti; it details with frightful minuteness the nature of\r\nhell-torments, accompanied by the most revolting pictures of the\r\ncondemned under various refined torments. It was translated in an\r\nabbreviated form, and sold for a few pence as a popular religious book\r\nin Ireland, and may be so still. It is divided into a series of\r\nmeditations for each day in the week, on hell and its torments.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABSENT MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe character of Bruyère's \"Absent Man\" has been translated in the\r\nSpectator, and exhibited on the theatre. It is supposed to be a\r\nfictitious character, or one highly coloured. It was well known,\r\nhowever, to his contemporaries, to be the Count de Brancas. The present\r\nanecdotes concerning the same person were unknown to, or forgotten by,\r\nBruyère; and are to the full as extraordinary as those which\r\ncharacterise _Menalcas_, or the Absent Man.\r\n\r\nThe count was reading by the fireside, but Heaven knows with what degree\r\nof attention, when the nurse brought him his infant child. He throws\r\ndown the book; he takes the child in his arms. He was playing with her,\r\nwhen an important visitor was announced. Having forgot he had quitted\r\nhis book, and that it was his child he held in his hands, he hastily\r\nflung the squalling innocent on the table.\r\n\r\nThe count was walking in the street, and the Duke de la Rochefoucault\r\ncrossed the way to speak to him.--\"God bless thee, poor man!\" exclaimed\r\nthe count. Rochefoucault smiled, and was beginning to address him:--\"Is\r\nit not enough,\" cried the count, interrupting him, and somewhat in a\r\npassion; \"is it not enough that I have said, at first, I have nothing\r\nfor you? Such lazy vagrants as you hinder a gentleman from walking the\r\nstreets.\" Rochefoucault burst into a loud laugh, and awakening the\r\nabsent man from his lethargy, he was not a little surprised, himself,\r\nthat he should have taken his friend for an importunate mendicant! La\r\nFontaine is recorded to have been one of the most absent men; and\r\nFuretière relates a most singular instance of this absence of mind. La\r\nFontaine attended the burial of one of his friends, and some time\r\nafterwards he called to visit him. At first he was shocked at the\r\ninformation of his death; but recovering from his surprise,\r\nobserved--\"True! true! I recollect I went to his funeral.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAX-WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have heard of many curious deceptions occasioned by the imitative\r\npowers of wax-work. A series of anatomical sculptures in coloured wax\r\nwas projected by the Grand Duke of Tuscany, under the direction of\r\nFontana. Twenty apartments have been filled with those curious\r\nimitations. They represent in every possible detail, and in each\r\nsuccessive stage of denudation, the organs of sense and reproduction;\r\nthe muscular, the vascular, the nervous, and the bony system. They\r\nimitate equally well the form, and more exactly the colouring, of nature\r\nthan injected preparations; and they have been employed to perpetuate\r\nmany transient phenomena of disease, of which no other art could have\r\nmade so lively a record.[61]\r\n\r\nThere is a species of wax-work, which, though it can hardly claim the\r\nhonours of the fine arts, is adapted to afford much pleasure--I mean\r\nfigures of wax, which may be modelled with great truth of character.\r\n\r\nMenage has noticed a work of this kind. In the year 1675, the Duke de\r\nMaine received a gilt cabinet, about the size of a moderate table. On\r\nthe door was inscribed, \"_The Apartment of Wit_.\" The inside exhibited\r\nan alcove and a long gallery. In an arm-chair was seated the figure of\r\nthe duke himself, composed of wax, the resemblance the most perfect\r\nimaginable. On one side stood the Duke de la Rochefoucault, to whom he\r\npresented a paper of verses for his examination. M. de Marsillac, and\r\nBossuet bishop of Meaux, were standing near the arm-chair. In the\r\nalcove, Madame de Thianges and Madame de la Fayette sat retired, reading\r\na book. Boileau, the satirist, stood at the door of the gallery,\r\nhindering seven or eight bad poets from entering. Near Boileau stood\r\nRacine, who seemed to beckon to La Fontaine to come forwards. All these\r\nfigures were formed of wax; and this philosophical baby-house,\r\ninteresting for the personages it imitated, might induce a wish in some\r\nphilosophers to play once more with one.\r\n\r\nThere was lately an old canon at Cologne who made a collection of small\r\nwax models of characteristic figures, such as personifications of\r\nMisery, in a haggard old man with a scanty crust and a brown jug before\r\nhim; or of Avarice, in a keen-looking Jew miser counting his gold: which\r\nwere done with such a spirit and reality that a Flemish painter, a\r\nHogarth or Wilkie, could hardly have worked up the _feeling_ of the\r\nfigure more impressively. \"All these were done with truth and expression\r\nwhich I could not have imagined the wax capable of exhibiting,\" says the\r\nlively writer of \"An Autumn near the Rhine.\" There is something very\r\ninfantine in this taste; but I lament that it is very rarely gratified\r\nby such close copiers of nature as was this old canon of Cologne.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: The finest collection at present is in Guy's Hospital,\r\nSouthwark; they are the work of an artist especially retained there, who\r\nby long practice has become perfect, making a labour of love of a\r\npursuit that would be disgustful to many.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASQUIN AND MARFORIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the world have heard of these _statues_: they have served as\r\nvehicles for the keenest satire in a land of the most uncontrolled\r\ndespotism. The _statue of Pasquin_ (from whence the word _pasquinade_)\r\nand that of _Marforio_ are placed in Rome in two different quarters.\r\n_Marforio_ is an ancient _statue_ of _Mars_, found in the _Forum_, which\r\nthe people have corrupted into _Marforio_. _Pasquin_ is a marble\r\n_statue_, greatly mutilated, supposed to be the figure of a\r\ngladiator.[62] To one or other of these _statues_, during the\r\nconcealment of the night, are affixed those satires or lampoons which\r\nthe authors wish should be dispersed about Rome without any danger to\r\nthemselves. When _Marforio_ is attacked, _Pasquin_ comes to his succour;\r\nand when _Pasquin_ is the sufferer, he finds in _Marforio_ a constant\r\ndefender. Thus, by a thrust and a parry, the most serious matters are\r\ndisclosed: and the most illustrious personages are attacked by their\r\nenemies, and defended by their friends.\r\n\r\nMisson, in his Travels in Italy, gives the following account of the\r\norigin of the name of the statue of _Pasquin_:--\r\n\r\nA satirical tailor, who lived at Rome, and whose name was _Pasquin_,\r\namused himself by severe raillery, liberally bestowed on those who\r\npassed by his shop; which in time became the lounge of the newsmongers.\r\nThe tailor had precisely the talents to head a regiment of satirical\r\nwits; and had he had time to _publish_, he would have been the Peter\r\nPindar of his day; but his genius seems to have been satisfied to rest\r\ncross-legged on his shopboard. When any lampoons or amusing bon-mots\r\nwere current at Rome, they were usually called, from his shop,\r\n_pasquinades_. After his death, this statue of an ancient gladiator was\r\nfound under the pavement of his shop. It was soon set up, and by\r\nuniversal consent was inscribed with his name; and they still attempt to\r\nraise him from the dead, and keep the caustic tailor alive, in the\r\nmarble gladiator of wit.\r\n\r\nThere is a very rare work, with this title:--\"Pasquillorum Tomi Duo;\"\r\nthe first containing the verse, and the second the prose pasquinades,\r\npublished at Basle, 1544. The rarity of this collection of satirical\r\npieces is entirely owing to the arts of suppression practised by the\r\npapal government. Sallengre, in his literary Memoirs, has given an\r\naccount of this work; his own copy had formerly belonged to Daniel\r\nHeinsius, who, in verses written in his hand, describes its rarity and\r\nthe price it too cost:--\r\n\r\n    Roma meos fratres igni dedit, unica Phoenix\r\n    Vivo, aureisque venio centum Heinsio.\r\n\r\n     \"Rome gave my brothers to the flames, but I survive a solitary\r\n     Phoenix. Heinsius bought me for a hundred golden ducats.\"\r\n\r\nThis collection contains a great number of pieces composed at different\r\ntimes, against the popes, cardinals, &c. They are not, indeed, materials\r\nfor the historian, and they must be taken with grains of allowance. We\r\nfind sarcastic epigrams on Leo X., and the infamous Lucretia, daughter\r\nof Alexander VI.: even the corrupt Romans of the day were capable of\r\nexpressing themselves with the utmost freedom. Of Alexander VI. we have\r\nan apology for his conduct:\r\n\r\n    Vendit Alexander claves, altaria, Christum;\r\n    Emerat ille prius, vendere jure potest.\r\n\r\n    \"Alexander _sells_ the keys, the altars, and Christ;\r\n    As he _bought_ them first, he had a right to _sell them_!\"\r\n\r\nOn Lucretia:--\r\n\r\n    Hoc tumulo dormit Lucretia nomine, sed re\r\n      Thais; Alexandri filia, sponsa, nurus!\r\n\r\n     \"Beneath this stone sleeps Lucretia by name, but by nature Thais;\r\n     the daughter, the wife, and the daughter-in-law of Alexander!\"\r\n\r\nLeo X. was a frequent butt for the arrows of Pasquin:--\r\n\r\n    Sacra sub extremâ, si forte requiritis, horâ\r\n      Cur Leo non potuit sumere; vendiderat.\r\n\r\n     \"Do you ask why Leo did not take the sacrament on his\r\n     death-bed?--How could he? He had sold it!\"\r\n\r\nMany of these satirical touches depend on puns. Urban VII., one of the\r\n_Barberini_ family, pillaged the Pantheon of brass to make cannon,[63]\r\non which occasion Pasquin was made to say:--\r\n\r\n    Quod non fecerunt _Barbari_ Romæ, fecit _Barberini_.\r\n\r\nOn Clement VII., whose death was said to be occasioned by the\r\nprescriptions of his physician:--\r\n\r\n    Curtius occidit Clementem; Curtius auro\r\n      Donandus, per quem publica parta salus.\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. Curtius has killed the pope by his remedies; he ought to be\r\n     remunerated as a man who has cured the state.\"\r\n\r\nThe following, on Paul III., are singular conceptions:--\r\n\r\n    Papa Medusæum caput est, coma turba Nepotum;\r\n      Perseu cæde caput, Cæsaries periit.\r\n\r\n     \"The pope is the head of Medusa; the horrid tresses are his\r\n     nephews; Perseus, cut off the head, and then we shall be rid of\r\n     these serpent-locks.\"\r\n\r\nAnother is sarcastic--\r\n\r\n    Ut canerent data multa olim sunt Vatibus æra:\r\n      Ut taceam, quantum tu mihi, Paule, dabis?\r\n\r\n     \"Heretofore money was given to poets that they might sing: how much\r\n     will you give me, Paul, to be silent?\"\r\n\r\nThis collection contains, among other classes, passages from the\r\nScriptures which have been applied to the court of Rome; to different\r\nnations and persons; and one of \"_Sortes Virgilianæ per Pasquillum\r\ncollectæ_,\"--passages from Virgil frequently happily applied; and those\r\nwho are curious in the history of those times will find this portion\r\ninteresting. The work itself is not quite so rare as Daniel Heinsius\r\nimagined; the price might now reach from five to ten guineas.[64]\r\n\r\nThese satirical statues are placed at opposite ends of the town, so that\r\nthere is always sufficient time to make Marforio reply to the gibes and\r\njeers of Pasquin in walking from one to the other. They are an ingenious\r\nsubstitute for publishing to the world, what no Roman newspaper would\r\ndare to print.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: The description of these two famous statues is not\r\ncorrectly given in the text. The statue called _Marforio_ is the figure\r\nof a recumbent river god of colossal proportions, found near the arch of\r\nSeptimius Severus. When the museum of the capitol was completed, the\r\nPope moved the figure into the court-yard; there it is still to be seen.\r\nHe also wished to move that of _Pasquin_, but the Duke de Braschi\r\nrefused to allow it; and it still stands on its pedestal, at the angle\r\nof the Braschi Palace, in the small square that takes the name of Piazza\r\ndel Pasquino from that circumstance. It is much mutilated, but is the\r\nruin of a very fine work; Bernini expressed great admiration for it. It\r\nis considered by Count Maffei to represent Ajax supporting Menelaus. The\r\ntorso of the latter figure only is left, the arms of the former are\r\nbroken away; but enough remains of both to conjecture what the original\r\nmight have been in design. The _pose_ of both figures is similar to the\r\nfine group known as Ajax and Telamon, in the Loggia of the Pitti Palace\r\nat Florence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: The cannon were to supply the castle of St. Angelo, but a\r\nlarge portion of the metal (which formerly covered the roof of the\r\ntemple) was used to construct the canopy and pillars which still stand\r\nover the tomb of St. Peter, in the great cathedral at Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEMALE BEAUTY AND ORNAMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ladies in Japan gild their teeth; and those of the Indies paint them\r\nred. The pearl of teeth must be dyed black to be beautiful in Guzerat.\r\nIn Greenland the women colour their faces with blue and yellow. However\r\nfresh the complexion of a Muscovite may be, she would think herself very\r\nugly if she was not plastered over with paint. The Chinese must have\r\ntheir feet as diminutive as those of the she-goat; and to render them\r\nthus, their youth is passed in tortures. In ancient Persia an aquiline\r\nnose was often thought worthy of the crown; and if there was any\r\ncompetition between two princes, the people generally went by this\r\ncriterion of majesty. In some countries, the mothers break the noses of\r\ntheir children; and in others press the head between two boards, that it\r\nmay become square. The modern Persians have a strong aversion to red\r\nhair: the Turks, on the contrary, are warm admirers of it. The female\r\nHottentot receives from the hand of her lover, not silks nor wreaths of\r\nflowers, but warm guts and reeking tripe, to dress herself with enviable\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\nIn China, small round eyes are liked; and the girls are continually\r\nplucking their eye-brows, that they may be thin and long. The Turkish\r\nwomen dip a gold brush in the tincture of a black drug, which they pass\r\nover their eye-brows. It is too visible by day, but looks shining by\r\nnight. They tinge their nails with a rose-colour. An African beauty must\r\nhave small eyes, thick lips, a large flat nose, and a skin beautifully\r\nblack. The Emperor of Monomotapa would not change his amiable negress\r\nfor the most brilliant European beauty.\r\n\r\nAn ornament for the nose appears to us perfectly unnecessary. The\r\nPeruvians, however, think otherwise; and they hang on it a weighty ring,\r\nthe thickness of which is proportioned by the rank of their husbands.\r\nThe custom of boring it, as our ladies do their ears, is very common in\r\nseveral nations. Through the perforation are hung various materials;\r\nsuch as green crystal, gold, stones, a single and sometimes a great\r\nnumber of gold rings.[65] This is rather troublesome to them in blowing\r\ntheir noses; and the fact is, as some have informed us, that the Indian\r\nladies never perform this very useful operation.\r\n\r\nThe female head-dress is carried in some countries to singular\r\nextravagance. The Chinese fair carries on her head the figure of a\r\ncertain bird. This bird is composed of copper or of gold, according to\r\nthe quality of the person; the wings spread out, fall over the front of\r\nthe head-dress, and conceal the temples. The tail, long and open, forms\r\na beautiful tuft of feathers. The beak covers the top of the nose; the\r\nneck is fastened to the body of the artificial animal by a spring, that\r\nit may the more freely play, and tremble at the slightest motion.\r\n\r\nThe extravagance of the Myantses is far more ridiculous than the above.\r\nThey carry on their heads a slight board, rather longer than a foot, and\r\nabout six inches broad; with this they cover their hair, and seal it\r\nwith wax. They cannot lie down, or lean, without keeping the neck\r\nstraight; and the country being very woody, it is not uncommon to find\r\nthem with their head-dress entangled in the trees. Whenever they comb\r\ntheir hair, they pass an hour by the fire in melting the wax; but this\r\ncombing is only performed once or twice a year.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the land of Natal wear caps or bonnets, from six to\r\nten inches high, composed of the fat of oxen. They then gradually anoint\r\nthe head with a purer grease, which mixing with the hair, fastens these\r\n_bonnets_ for their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: This vehicle for satire was introduced early into England;\r\nthus, in 1589, was published \"The return of the renowned Cavaliero\r\nPasquill to England from the other side of the seas, and his meeting\r\nwith Marforio at London, upon the Royall Exchange.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: For some very strong remarks on this fashion, the reader\r\nmay consult Bulwer's _Anthropometamorphosis, or Artificiall Changeling_,\r\n1653. The author is very ungallant in his strictures on \"precious jewels\r\nin the snouts of such swine.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN PLATONISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nErasmus, in his Age of Religious Revolution, expressed an alarm, which\r\nin some shape has been since realized. He strangely, yet acutely\r\nobserves, that \"_literature_ began to make a great and happy progress;\r\nbut,\" he adds, \"I fear two things--that the study of _Hebrew_ will\r\npromote _Judaism_, and the study of _philology_ will revive PAGANISM.\"\r\nHe speaks to the same purpose in the Adages, c. 189, as Jortin observes.\r\nBlackwell, in his curious Life of Homer, after showing that the ancient\r\noracles were the fountains of knowledge, and that the votaries of the\r\n_god_ of _Delphi_ had their faith confirmed by the oracle's perfect\r\nacquaintance with the country, parentage, and fortunes of the suppliant,\r\nand many predictions verified; that besides all this, the oracles that\r\nhave reached us discover a wide knowledge of everything relating to\r\nGreece;--this learned writer is at a loss to account for a knowledge\r\nthat he thinks has something divine in it: it was a knowledge to be\r\nfound nowhere in Greece but among the _Oracles_. He would account for\r\nthis phenomenon by supposing there existed a succession of learned men\r\ndevoted to this purpose. He says, \"Either we must admit the knowledge of\r\nthe priests, or turn _converts to the ancients_, and believe in the\r\n_omniscience of Apollo, which in this age I know nobody in hazard of_.\"\r\nYet, to the astonishment of this writer, were he now living, he would\r\nhave witnessed this incredible fact! Even Erasmus himself might have\r\nwondered.\r\n\r\nWe discover the origin of MODERN PLATONISM, as it may be distinguished,\r\namong the Italians. About the middle of the fifteenth century, some time\r\nbefore the Turks had become masters of Constantinople, a great number of\r\nphilosophers flourished. _Gemisthus Pletho_ was one distinguished by his\r\ngenius, his erudition, and his fervent passion for _platonism_. Mr.\r\nRoscoe notices Pletho: \"His discourses had so powerful an effect upon\r\nCosmo de' Medici, who was his constant auditor, that he established an\r\nacademy at Florence, for the sole purpose of cultivating this new and\r\nmore elevated species of philosophy.\" The learned Marsilio Ficino\r\ntranslated Plotinus, that great archimage of _platonic mysticism_. Such\r\nwere Pletho's eminent abilities, that in his old age those whom his\r\nnovel system had greatly irritated either feared or respected him. He\r\nhad scarcely breathed his last when they began to abuse Plato and our\r\nPletho. The following account is written by George of Trebizond.\r\n\r\n\"Lately has risen amongst us a second Mahomet: and this second, if we do\r\nnot take care, will exceed in greatness the first, by the dreadful\r\nconsequences of his wicked doctrine, as the first has exceeded Plato. A\r\ndisciple and rival of this philosopher in philosophy, in eloquence, and\r\nin science, he had fixed his residence in the Peloponnese. His common\r\nname was _Gemisthus_, but he assumed that of _Pletho_. Perhaps\r\nGemisthus, to make us believe more easily that he was descended from\r\nheaven, and to engage us to receive more readily his doctrine and his\r\nnew law, wished to change his name, according to the manner of the\r\nancient patriarchs, of whom it is said, that at the time the name was\r\nchanged they were called to the greatest things. He has written with no\r\nvulgar art, and with no common elegance. He has given new rules for the\r\nconduct of life, and for the regulation of human affairs; and at the\r\nsame time has vomited forth a great number of blasphemies against the\r\nCatholic religion. He was so zealous a platonist that he entertained no\r\nother sentiments than those of Plato, concerning the nature of the gods,\r\nsouls, sacrifices, &c. I have heard him myself, when we were together at\r\nFlorence, say, that in a few years all men on the face of the earth\r\nwould embrace with one common consent, and with one mind, a single and\r\nsimple religion, at the first instructions which should be given by a\r\nsingle preaching. And when I asked him if it would be the religion of\r\nJesus Christ, or that of Mahomet? he answered, 'Neither one nor the\r\nother; but a _third_, which will not greatly differ from _paganism_.'\r\nThese words I heard with so much indignation, that since that time I\r\nhave always hated him: I look upon him as a dangerous viper; and I\r\ncannot think of him without abhorrence.\"\r\n\r\nThe pious writer might have been satisfied to have bestowed a smile of\r\npity or contempt.\r\n\r\nWhen Pletho died, full of years and honours, the malice of his enemies\r\ncollected all its venom. This circumstance seems to prove that his\r\nabilities must have been great indeed, to have kept such crowds silent.\r\nSeveral Catholic writers lament that his book was burnt, and regret the\r\nloss of Pletho's work; which, they say, was not designed to subvert the\r\nChristian religion, but only to unfold the system of Plato, and to\r\ncollect what he and other philosophers had written on religion and\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nOf his religious scheme, the reader may judge by this summary account.\r\nThe general title of the volume ran thus:--\"This book treats of the laws\r\nof the best form of government, and what all men must observe in their\r\npublic and private stations, to live together in the most perfect, the\r\nmost innocent, and the most happy manner.\" The whole was divided into\r\nthree books. The titles of the chapters where paganism was openly\r\ninculcated are reported by Gennadius, who condemned it to the flames,\r\nbut who has not thought proper to enter into the manner of his\r\narguments. The extravagance of this new legislator appeared, above all,\r\nin the articles which concerned religion. He acknowledges a plurality of\r\ngods: some superior, whom he placed above the heavens; and the others\r\ninferior, on this side the heavens. The first existing from the remotest\r\nantiquity; the others younger, and of different ages. He gave a king to\r\nall these gods, and he called him [Greek: ZEUS], or _Jupiter_; as the\r\npagans named this power formerly. According to him, the stars had a\r\nsoul; the demons were not malignant spirits; and the world was eternal.\r\nHe established polygamy, and was even inclined to a community of women.\r\nAll his work was filled with such reveries, and, with not a few\r\nimpieties, which my pious author has not ventured to give.\r\n\r\nWhat were the intentions of Pletho? If the work was only an arranged\r\nsystem of paganism, or the platonic philosophy, it might have been an\r\ninnocent, if not a curious volume. He was learned and humane, and had\r\nnot passed his life entirely in the solitary recesses of his study.\r\n\r\nTo strain human curiosity to the utmost limits of human credibility, a\r\n_modern Pletho_ has risen in Mr. _Thomas Taylor_, who, consonant to the\r\nplatonic philosophy in the present day, religiously professes\r\n_polytheism_! At the close of the eighteenth century, be it recorded,\r\nwere published many volumes, in which the author affects to avow himself\r\na zealous Platonist, and asserts that he can prove that the Christian\r\nreligion is \"a bastardized and barbarous Platonism.\" The divinities of\r\nPlato are the divinities to be adored, and we are to be taught to call\r\nGod, Jupiter; the Virgin, Venus; and Christ, Cupid! The Iliad of Homer\r\nallegorised, is converted into a Greek bible of the arcana of nature!\r\nExtraordinary as this literary lunacy may appear, we must observe, that\r\nit stands not singular in the annals of the history of the human mind.\r\nThe Florentine Academy, which Cosmo founded, had, no doubt, some\r\nclassical enthusiasts; but who, perhaps, according to the political\r\ncharacter of their country, were prudent and reserved. The platonic\r\nfuror, however, appears to have reached other countries. In the reign of\r\nLouis XII., a scholar named Hemon de la Fosse, a native of Abbeville, by\r\ncontinually reading the Greek and Latin writers, became mad enough to\r\npersuade himself that it was impossible that the religion of such great\r\ngeniuses as Homer, Cicero, and Virgil was a false one. On the 25th of\r\nAugust, 1503, being at church, he suddenly snatched the host from the\r\nhands of the priest, at the moment it was raised, exclaiming--\"What!\r\nalways this folly!\" He was immediately seized. In the hope that he would\r\nabjure his extravagant errors, they delayed his punishment; but no\r\nexhortation or entreaties availed. He persisted in maintaining that\r\nJupiter was the sovereign God of the universe, and that there was no\r\nother paradise than the Elysian fields. He was burnt alive, after having\r\nfirst had his tongue pierced, and his hand cut off. Thus perished an\r\nardent and learned youth, who ought only to have been condemned as a\r\nBedlamite.\r\n\r\nDr. More, the most rational of our modern Platonists, abounds, however,\r\nwith the most extravagant reveries, and was inflated with egotism and\r\nenthusiasm, as much as any of his mystic predecessors. He conceived that\r\nhe communed with the Divinity itself! that he had been shot as a fiery\r\ndart into the world, and he hoped he had hit the mark. He carried his\r\nself-conceit to such extravagance, that he thought his urine smelt like\r\nviolets, and his body in the spring season had a sweet odour; a\r\nperfection peculiar to himself. These visionaries indulge the most\r\nfanciful vanity.\r\n\r\nThe \"sweet odours,\" and that of \"the violets,\" might, however, have been\r\nreal--for they mark a certain stage of the disease of diabetes, as\r\nappears in a medical tract by the elder Dr. Latham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTES OF FASHION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA volume on this subject might be made very curious and entertaining,\r\nfor our ancestors were not less vacillating, and perhaps more\r\ncapriciously grotesque, though with infinitely less taste, than the\r\npresent generation. Were a philosopher and an artist, as well as an\r\nantiquary, to compose such a work, much diversified entertainment, and\r\nsome curious investigation of the progress of the arts and taste, would\r\ndoubtless be the result; the subject otherwise appears of trifling\r\nvalue; the very farthing pieces of history.\r\n\r\nThe origin of many fashions was in the endeavour to conceal some\r\ndeformity of the inventor: hence the cushions, ruffs, hoops, and other\r\nmonstrous devices. If a reigning beauty chanced to have an unequal hip,\r\nthose who had very handsome hips would load them with that false rump\r\nwhich the other was compelled by the unkindness of nature to substitute.\r\nPatches were invented in England in the reign of Edward VI. by a foreign\r\nlady, who in this manner ingeniously covered a wen on her neck.\r\nFull-bottomed wigs were invented by a French barber, one Duviller, whose\r\nname they perpetuated, for the purpose of concealing an elevation in the\r\nshoulder of the Dauphin. Charles VII. of France introduced long coats to\r\nhide his ill-made legs. Shoes with very long points, full two feet in\r\nlength, were invented by Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Anjou, to conceal a\r\nlarge excrescence on one of his feet. When Francis I. was obliged to\r\nwear his hair short, owing to a wound he received in the head, it became\r\na prevailing fashion at court. Others, on the contrary, adapted fashions\r\nto set off their peculiar beauties: as Isabella of Bavaria, remarkable\r\nfor her gallantry, and the fairness of her complexion, introduced the\r\nfashion of leaving the shoulders and part of the neck uncovered.\r\n\r\nFashions have frequently originated from circumstances as silly as the\r\nfollowing one. Isabella, daughter of Philip II. and wife of the Archduke\r\nAlbert, vowed not to change her linen till Ostend was taken; this siege,\r\nunluckily for her comfort, lasted three years; and the supposed colour\r\nof the archduchess's linen gave rise to a fashionable colour, hence\r\ncalled _l'Isabeau_, or the Isabella; a kind of whitish-yellow-dingy.\r\nSometimes they originate in some temporary event; as after the battle of\r\nSteenkirk, where the allies wore large cravats, by which the French\r\nfrequently seized hold of them, a circumstance perpetuated on the medals\r\nof Louis XIV., cravats were called Steenkirks; and after the battle of\r\nRamilies, wigs received that denomination.\r\n\r\nThe _court_, in all ages and in every country, are the modellers of\r\nfashions; so that all the ridicule, of which these are so susceptible,\r\nmust fall on them, and not upon their servile imitators the _citizens_.\r\nThis complaint is made even so far back as in 1586, by Jean des Caures,\r\nan old French moralist, who, in declaiming against the fashions of his\r\nday, notices one, of the ladies carrying _mirrors fixed to their\r\nwaists_, which seemed to employ their eyes in perpetual activity. From\r\nthis mode will result, according to honest Des Caures, their eternal\r\ndamnation. \"Alas! (he exclaims) in what an age do we live: to see such\r\ndepravity which we see, that induces them even to bring into church\r\nthese _scandalous mirrors hanging about their waists_! Let all\r\nhistories, divine, human, and profane, be consulted; never will it be\r\nfound that these objects of vanity were ever thus brought into public by\r\nthe most meretricious of the sex. It is true, at present none but the\r\nladies of the court venture to wear them; but long it will not be before\r\n_every citizen's daughter_ and every _female servant_, will have them!\"\r\nSuch in all times has been the rise and decline of fashion; and the\r\nabsurd mimicry of the _citizens_, even of the lowest classes, to their\r\nvery ruin, in straining to rival the _newest fashion_, has mortified and\r\ngalled the courtier.\r\n\r\nOn this subject old Camden, in his Remains, relates a story of a trick\r\nplayed off on a citizen, which I give in the plainness of his own\r\nvenerable style. Sir Philip Calthrop purged John Drakes, the _shoemaker\r\nof Norwich_, in the time of King Henry VIII. of the _proud humour_ which\r\nour _people have to be of the gentlemen's cut_. This knight bought on a\r\ntime as much fine French tawny cloth as should make him a gown, and sent\r\nit to the taylor's to be made. John Drakes, a shoemaker of that town,\r\ncoming to this said taylor's, and seeing the knight's gown cloth lying\r\nthere, liking it well, caused the taylor to buy him as much of the same\r\ncloth and price to the same intent, and further bade him to _make it of\r\nthe same fashion that the knight would have his made of_. Not long\r\nafter, the knight coming to the taylor's to take measure of his gown,\r\nperceiving the like cloth lying there, asked of the taylor whose it was?\r\nQuoth the taylor, it is John Drakes' the _shoemaker_, who will have it\r\n_made of the self-same fashion that yours is made of_! 'Well!' said the\r\nknight, 'in good time be it! I will have mine made _as full of cuts as\r\nthy shears can make it_.' 'It shall be done!' said the taylor;\r\nwhereupon, because the time drew near, he made haste to finish both\r\ntheir garments. John Drakes had no time to go to the taylor's till\r\nChristmas-day, for serving his customers, when he hoped to have worn his\r\ngown; perceiving the same to be _full of cuts_ began to swear at the\r\ntaylor, for the making his gown after that sort. 'I have done nothing,'\r\nquoth the taylor, 'but that you bid me; for as Sir Philip Calthrop's\r\ngarment is, even so I have made yours!' 'By my latchet!' quoth John\r\nDrakes, '_I will never wear gentlemen's fashions again_!'\r\n\r\nSometimes fashions are quite reversed in their use in one age from\r\nanother. Bags, when first in fashion in France, were only worn _en\r\ndéshabillé_; in visits of ceremony, the hair was tied by a riband and\r\nfloated over the shoulders, which is exactly reversed in the present\r\nfashion. In the year 1735 the men had no hats but a little chapeau de\r\nbras; in 1745 they wore a very small hat; in 1755 they wore an enormous\r\none, as may be seen in Jeffrey's curious \"Collection of Habits in all\r\nNations.\" Old Puttenham, in \"The Art of Poesie,\" p. 239, on the present\r\ntopic gives some curious information. \"Henry VIII. caused his own head,\r\nand all his courtiers, to be _polled_ and his _beard_ to be _cut short_;\r\n_before that time_ it was thought _more decent_, both for old men and\r\nyoung, to be _all shaven_, and weare _long haire_, either rounded or\r\nsquare. Now _again at this time_ (Elizabeth's reign), the young\r\ngentlemen of the court have _taken up the long haire_ trayling on their\r\nshoulders, and think this more decent; for what respect I would be glad\r\nto know.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the fair sex were accustomed to behold their lovers with beards,\r\nthe sight of a shaved chin excited feelings of horror and aversion; as\r\nmuch indeed as, in this less heroic age, would a gallant whose luxuriant\r\nbeard should\r\n\r\n    \"Stream like a meteor to the troubled air.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Louis VII., to obey the injunctions of his bishops, cropped his\r\nhair, and shaved his beard, Eleanor, his consort, found him, with this\r\nunusual appearance, very ridiculous, and soon very contemptible. She\r\nrevenged herself as she thought proper, and the poor shaved king\r\nobtained a divorce. She then married the Count of Anjou, afterwards our\r\nHenry II. She had for her marriage dower the rich provinces of Poitou\r\nand Guienne; and this was the origin of those wars which for three\r\nhundred years ravaged France, and cost the French three millions of men.\r\nAll which, probably, had never occurred had Louis VII. not been so rash\r\nas to crop his head and shave his beard, by which he became so\r\ndisgustful in the eyes of our Queen Eleanor.\r\n\r\nWe cannot perhaps sympathise with the feelings of her majesty, though at\r\nConstantinople she might not have been considered unreasonable. There\r\nmust be something more powerful in _beards_ and _mustachios_ than we are\r\nquite aware of; for when these were in fashion--and long after this was\r\nwritten--the fashion has returned on us--with what enthusiasm were they\r\nnot contemplated! When _mustachios_ were in general use, an author, in\r\nhis Elements of Education, published in 1640, thinks that \"hairy\r\nexcrement,\" as Armado in \"Love's Labour Lost\" calls it, contributed to\r\nmake men valorous. He says, \"I have a favourable opinion of that young\r\ngentleman who is _curious in fine mustachios_. The time he employs in\r\nadjusting, dressing, and curling them, is no lost time; for the more he\r\ncontemplates his mustachios, the more his mind will cherish and be\r\nanimated by masculine and courageous notions.\" The best reason that\r\ncould be given for wearing the _longest and largest beard_ of any\r\nEnglishman was that of a worthy clergyman in Elizabeth's reign, \"that no\r\nact of his life might be unworthy of the gravity of his appearance.\"\r\n\r\nThe grandfather of Mrs. Thomas, the Corinna of Cromwell, the literary\r\nfriend of Pope, by her account, \"was very nice in the mode of that age,\r\nhis valet being some hours every morning in _starching his beard_ and\r\n_curling his whiskers_; during which time he was always read to.\"\r\nTaylor, the water poet, humorously describes the great variety of beards\r\nin his time, which extract may be found in Grey's Hudibras, Vol. I. p.\r\n300. The _beard_ dwindled gradually under the two Charleses, till it was\r\nreduced into _whiskers_, and became extinct in the reign of James II.,\r\nas if its fatality had been connected with that of the house of Stuart.\r\n\r\nThe hair has in all ages been an endless topic for the declamation of\r\nthe moralist, and the favourite object of fashion. If the _beau monde_\r\nwore their hair luxuriant, or their wig enormous, the preachers, in\r\nCharles the Second's reign, instantly were seen in the pulpit with their\r\nhair cut shorter, and their sermon longer, in consequence; respect was,\r\nhowever, paid by the world to the size of the _wig_, in spite of the\r\n_hair-cutter_ in the pulpit. Our judges, and till lately our physicians,\r\nwell knew its magical effect. In the reign of Charles II. the\r\nhair-dress of the ladies was very elaborate; it was not only curled and\r\nfrizzled with the nicest art, but set off with certain artificial curls,\r\nthen too emphatically known by the pathetic terms of _heart-breakers_\r\nand _love-locks_. So late as William and Mary, lads, and even children,\r\nwore wigs; and if they had not wigs, they curled their hair to resemble\r\nthis fashionable ornament. Women then were the hair-dressers.\r\n\r\nThere are flagrant follies in fashion which must be endured while they\r\nreign, and which never appear ridiculous till they are out of fashion.\r\nIn the reign of Henry III. of France, they could not exist without an\r\nabundant use of comfits. All the world, the grave and the gay, carried\r\nin their pockets a _comfit-box_, as we do snuff-boxes. They used them\r\neven on the most solemn occasions; when the Duke of Guise was shot at\r\nBlois, he was found with his comfit-box in his hand.--Fashions indeed\r\nhave been carried to so extravagant a length, as to have become a public\r\noffence, and to have required the interference of government. Short and\r\ntight breeches were so much the rage in France, that Charles V. was\r\ncompelled to banish this disgusting mode by edicts, which may be found\r\nin Mezerai. An Italian author of the fifteenth century supposes an\r\nItalian traveller of nice modesty would not pass through France, that he\r\nmight not be offended by seeing men whose clothes rather exposed their\r\nnakedness than hid it. The very same fashion was the complaint in the\r\nremoter period of our Chaucer, in his Parson's Tale.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of our Elizabeth the reverse of all this took place; then\r\nthe mode of enormous breeches was pushed to a most laughable excess. The\r\nbeaux of that day stuffed out their breeches with rags, feathers, and\r\nother light matters, till they brought them out to an enormous size.\r\nThey resembled woolsacks, and in a public spectacle they were obliged to\r\nraise scaffolds for the seats of these ponderous beaux. To accord with\r\nthis fantastical taste, the ladies invented large hoop farthingales; two\r\nlovers aside could surely never have taken one another by the hand. In a\r\npreceding reign the fashion ran on square toes; insomuch that a\r\nproclamation was issued that no person should wear shoes above six\r\ninches square at the toes! Then succeeded picked-pointed shoes! The\r\nnation was again, in the reign of Elizabeth, put under the royal\r\nauthority. \"In that time,\" says honest John Stowe, \"he was held the\r\ngreatest gallant that had the _deepest ruff_ and _longest rapier_: the\r\noffence to the eye of the one, and hurt unto the life of the subject\r\nthat came by the other--this caused her Majestie to _make proclamation\r\nagainst them both_, and to _place selected grave citizens at every gate,\r\nto cut the ruffes, and breake the rapiers' points_ of all passengers\r\nthat exceeded a yeard in length of their rapiers, and a nayle of a yeard\r\nin depth of their ruffes.\" These \"grave citizens,\" at every gate cutting\r\nthe ruffs and breaking the rapiers, must doubtless have encountered in\r\ntheir ludicrous employment some stubborn opposition; but this regulation\r\nwas, in the spirit of that age, despotic and effectual. Paul, the\r\nEmperor of Russia, one day ordered the soldiers to stop every passenger\r\nwho wore pantaloons, and with their hangers to cut off, upon the leg,\r\nthe offending part of these superfluous breeches; so that a man's legs\r\ndepended greatly on the adroitness and humanity of a Russ or a Cossack;\r\nhowever this war against _pantaloons_ was very successful, and obtained\r\na complete triumph in favour of the _breeches_ in the course of the\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nA shameful extravagance in dress has been a most venerable folly. In the\r\nreign of Richard II. their dress was sumptuous beyond belief. Sir John\r\nArundel had a change of no less than fifty-two new suits of cloth of\r\ngold tissue. The prelates indulged in all the ostentatious luxury of\r\ndress. Chaucer says, they had \"chaunge of clothing everie daie.\"\r\nBrantome records of Elizabeth, Queen of Philip II. of Spain, that she\r\nnever wore a gown twice; this was told him by her majesty's own\r\n_tailleur_, who from a poor man soon became as rich as any one he knew.\r\nOur own Elizabeth left no less than three thousand different habits in\r\nher wardrobe when she died. She was possessed of the dresses of all\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe catholic religion has ever considered the pomp of the clerical habit\r\nas not the slightest part of its religious ceremonies; their devotion is\r\naddressed to the eye of the people. In the reign of our catholic Queen\r\nMary, the dress of a priest was costly indeed; and the sarcastic and\r\ngood-humoured Fuller gives, in his Worthies, the will of a priest, to\r\nshow the wardrobe of men of his order, and desires that the priest may\r\nnot be jeered for the gallantry of his splendid apparel. He bequeaths to\r\nvarious parish churches and persons, \"My vestment of crimson satin--my\r\nvestment of crimson velvet--my stole and fanon set with pearl--my black\r\ngown faced with taffeta,\" &c.\r\n\r\nChaucer has minutely detailed in \"The Persone's Tale\" the grotesque and\r\nthe costly fashions of his day; and the simplicity of the venerable\r\nsatirist will interest the antiquary and the philosopher. Much, and\r\ncuriously, has his caustic severity or lenient humour descanted on the\r\n\"moche superfluitee,\" and \"wast of cloth in vanitee,\" as well as \"the\r\ndisordinate scantnesse.\" In the spirit of the good old times, he\r\ncalculates \"the coste of the embrouding or embroidering; endenting or\r\nbarring; ounding or wavy; paling or imitating pales; and winding or\r\nbending; the costlewe furring in the gounes; so much pounsoning of\r\nchesel to maken holes (that is, punched with a bodkin); so moche dagging\r\nof sheres (cutting into slips); with the superfluitee in length of the\r\ngounes trailing in the dong and in the myre, on horse and eke on foot,\r\nas wel of man as of woman--that all thilke trailing,\" he verily\r\nbelieves, which wastes, consumes, wears threadbare, and is rotten with\r\ndung, are all to the damage of \"the poor folk,\" who might be clothed\r\nonly out of the flounces and draggle-tails of these children of vanity.\r\nBut then his Parson is not less bitter against \"the horrible disordinat\r\nscantnesse of clothing,\" and very copiously he describes, though perhaps\r\nin terms and with a humour too coarse for me to transcribe, the\r\nconsequences of these very tight dresses. Of these persons, among other\r\noffensive matters, he sees \"the buttokkes behind, as if they were the\r\nhinder part of a sheap, in the ful of the mone.\" He notices one of the\r\nmost grotesque modes, the wearing a parti-coloured dress; one stocking\r\npart white and part red, so that they looked as if they had been flayed.\r\nOr white and blue, or white and black, or black and red; this variety of\r\ncolours gave an appearance to their members of St. Anthony's fire, or\r\ncancer, or other mischance!\r\n\r\nThe modes of dress during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were\r\nso various and ridiculous, that they afforded perpetual food for the\r\neager satirist.\r\n\r\nThe conquests of Edward III. introduced the French fashions into\r\nEngland; and the Scotch adopted them by their alliance with the French\r\ncourt, and close intercourse with that nation.\r\n\r\nWalsingham dates the introduction of French fashions among us from the\r\ntaking of Calais in 1347; but we appear to have possessed such a rage\r\nfor imitation in dress, that an English beau was actually a fantastical\r\ncompound of all the fashions in Europe, and even Asia, in the reign of\r\nElizabeth. In Chaucer's time, the prevalence of French fashions was a\r\ncommon topic with our satirist; and he notices the affectation of our\r\nfemale citizens in speaking the French language, a stroke of satire\r\nwhich, after four centuries, is not obsolete, if applied to their faulty\r\npronunciation. In the prologue to the Prioresse, Chaucer has these\r\nhumorous lines:--\r\n\r\n    Entewned in her voice full seemly,\r\n    And French she spake full feteously,\r\n    _After the Scole of Stratford at Bowe_:\r\n    The _French of Paris_ was to her unknowe.\r\n\r\nA beau of the reign of Henry IV. has been made out, by the laborious\r\nHenry. They wore then long-pointed shoes to such an immoderate length,\r\nthat they could not walk till they were fastened to their knees with\r\nchains. Luxury improving on this ridiculous mode, these chains the\r\nEnglish beau of the fourteenth century had made of gold and silver; but\r\nthe grotesque fashion did not finish here, for the tops of their shoes\r\nwere carved in the manner of a church window. The ladies of that period\r\nwere not less fantastical.\r\n\r\nThe wild variety of dresses worn in the reign of Henry VIII. is alluded\r\nto in a print of a naked Englishman holding a piece of cloth hanging on\r\nhis right arm, and a pair of shears in his left hand. It was invented by\r\nAndrew Borde, a learned wit of those days. The print bears the following\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\n    I am an Englishman, and naked I stand here,\r\n    Musing in my mind, what rayment I shall were;\r\n    For now I will were this, and now I will were that,\r\n    And now I will were what I cannot tell what.\r\n\r\nAt a lower period, about the reign of Elizabeth, we are presented with a\r\ncurious picture of a man of fashion by Puttenham, in his \"Arte of\r\nPoetry,\" p. 250. This author was a travelled courtier, and has\r\ninterspersed his curious work with many lively anecdotes of the times.\r\nThis is his fantastical beau in the reign of Elizabeth. \"May it not\r\nseeme enough for a courtier to know how to _weare a feather_ and _set\r\nhis cappe_ aflaunt; his _chain en echarpe_; a straight _buskin, al\r\nInglese_; a loose _à la Turquesque_; the cape _alla Spaniola_; the\r\nbreech _à la Françoise_, and, by twentie maner of new-fashioned\r\ngarments, to disguise his body and his face with as many countenances,\r\nwhereof it seems there be many that make a very arte and studie, who\r\ncan shewe himselfe most fine, I will not say most foolish or\r\nridiculous.\" So that a beau of those times wore in the same dress a\r\ngrotesque mixture of all the fashions in the world. About the same\r\nperiod the _ton_ ran in a different course in France. There, fashion\r\nconsisted in an affected negligence of dress; for Montaigne honestly\r\nlaments, in Book i. Cap. 25--\"I have never yet been apt to imitate the\r\n_negligent garb_ which is yet observable among the _young men_ of our\r\ntime; to wear my _cloak on one shoulder_, my _bonnet on one side_, and\r\n_one stocking_ in something _more disorder than the other_, meant to\r\nexpress a manly disdain of such exotic ornaments, and a contempt of\r\nart.\"\r\n\r\nThe fashions of the Elizabethan age have been chronicled by honest John\r\nStowe. Stowe was originally a _tailor_, and when he laid down the\r\nshears, and took up the pen, the taste and curiosity for _dress_ was\r\nstill retained. He is the grave chronicler of matters not grave. The\r\nchronology of ruffs, and tufted taffetas; the revolution of steel\r\npoking-sticks, instead of bone or wood, used by the laundresses; the\r\ninvasion of shoe-buckles, and the total rout of shoe-roses; that grand\r\nadventure of a certain Flemish lady, who introduced the art of starching\r\nthe ruffs with a yellow tinge into Britain: while Mrs. Montague emulated\r\nher in the royal favour, by presenting her highness the queen with a\r\npair of black silk stockings, instead of her cloth hose, which her\r\nmajesty now for ever rejected; the heroic achievements of the Right\r\nHonourable Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who first brought from Italy\r\nthe whole mystery and craft of perfumery, and costly washes; and among\r\nother pleasant things besides, a perfumed jerkin, a pair of perfumed\r\ngloves trimmed with roses, in which the queen took such delight, that\r\nshe was actually pictured with those gloves on her royal hands, and for\r\nmany years after the scent was called the Earl of Oxford's Perfume.\r\nThese, and occurrences as memorable, receive a pleasant kind of\r\nhistorical pomp in the important, and not incurious, narrative of the\r\nantiquary and the tailor. The toilet of Elizabeth was indeed an altar of\r\ndevotion, of which she was the idol, and all her ministers were her\r\nvotaries: it was the reign of coquetry, and the golden age of millinery!\r\nBut for grace and elegance they had not the slightest feeling! There is\r\na print by Vertue, of Queen Elizabeth going in a procession to Lord\r\nHunsdon. This procession is led by Lady Hunsdon, who no doubt was the\r\nleader likewise of the fashion; but it is impossible, with our ideas of\r\ngrace and comfort, not to commiserate this unfortunate lady; whose\r\nstanding-up wire ruff, rising above her head; whose stays, or bodice, so\r\nlong-waisted as to reach to her knees; and the circumference of her\r\nlarge hoop farthingale, which seems to enclose her in a capacious tub;\r\nmark her out as one of the most pitiable martyrs of ancient modes. The\r\namorous Sir Walter Raleigh must have found some of the maids of honour\r\nthe most impregnable fortification his gallant spirit ever assailed: a\r\n_coup de main_ was impossible.\r\n\r\nI shall transcribe from old Stowe a few extracts, which may amuse the\r\nreader:--\r\n\r\n\"In the second yeere of Queen Elizabeth, 1560, her _silke woman_,\r\nMistris Montague, presented her majestie for a new yeere's gift, a\r\n_paire of black knit silk stockings_, the which, after a few days'\r\nwearing, pleased her highness so well, that she sent for Mistris\r\nMontague, and asked her where she had them, and if she could help her to\r\nany more; who answered, saying, 'I made them very carefully of purpose\r\nonly for your majestie, and seeing these please you so well, I will\r\npresently set more in hand.' 'Do so (quoth the queene), for _indeed I\r\nlike silk stockings so well, because they are pleasant, fine, and\r\ndelicate, that henceforth I will wear no more_ CLOTH STOCKINGS'--and\r\nfrom that time unto her death the queene never wore any more _cloth\r\nhose_, but only silke stockings; for you shall understand that King\r\nHenry the Eight did weare onely cloath hose, or hose cut out of\r\nell-broade taffety, or that by great chance there came a pair of\r\n_Spanish silk stockings_ from Spain. King Edward the Sixt had a _payre\r\nof long Spanish silk stockings_ sent him for a _great present_.--Dukes'\r\ndaughters then wore gownes of satten of Bridges (Bruges) upon solemn\r\ndayes. Cushens, and window pillows of velvet and damaske, formerly only\r\nprincely furniture, now be very plenteous in most citizens' houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Milloners or haberdashers had not then any _gloves imbroydered_, or\r\ntrimmed with gold, or silke; neither gold nor imbroydered girdles and\r\nhangers, neither could they _make any costly wash_ or _perfume_, until\r\nabout the fifteenth yeere of the queene, the Right Honourable Edward de\r\nVere, Earl of Oxford, came from _Italy_, and brought with him gloves,\r\nsweete bagges, a perfumed leather jerkin, and other _pleasant things_;\r\nand that yeere the queene had a _pair of perfumed gloves_ trimmed only\r\nwith four tuffes, or _roses of coloured silk_. The queene took such\r\npleasure in those gloves, that she was pictured with those gloves upon\r\nher handes, and for many years after it was called '_The Earl of\r\nOxford's perfume_.'\"\r\n\r\nIn such a chronology of fashions, an event not less important surely was\r\nthe origin of _starching_; and here we find it treated with the utmost\r\nhistorical dignity.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1564, Mistris Dinghen Van den Plasse, borne at Tænen in\r\nFlaunders, daughter to a worshipfull knight of that province, with her\r\nhusband, came to London for their better safeties and there professed\r\nherself a _starcher_, wherein she excelled, unto whom her owne nation\r\npresently repaired, and payed her very liberally for her worke. Some\r\nvery few of the best and most curious wives of that time, observing the\r\n_neatness and delicacy of the Dutch for whitenesse and fine wearing of\r\nlinen_, made them _cambricke ruffs_, and sent them to Mistris Dinghen to\r\n_starch_, and after awhile they made them _ruffes of lawn_, which was at\r\nthat time a stuff most strange, and wonderfull, and thereupon rose a\r\n_general scoffe_ or _by-word_, that shortly they would make _ruffs of a\r\nspider's web_; and then they began to send their daughters and nearest\r\nkinswomen to Mistris Dinghen to _learn how to starche_; her usuall price\r\nwas at that time, foure or five pound, to teach them how _to starch_,\r\nand twenty shillings how to _seeth starch_.\"\r\n\r\nThus Italy, Holland, and France supplied us with fashions and\r\nrefinements. But in those days there were, as I have shown from\r\nPuttenham, as _extravagant dressers_ as any of their present supposed\r\ndegenerate descendants. Stowe affords us another curious extract.\r\n\"Divers noble personages made them _ruffes, a full quarter of a yeard\r\ndeepe_, and two lengthe in one ruffe. This _fashion_ in _London_ was\r\ncalled the _French fashion_; but when Englishmen came to _Paris_, the\r\n_French_ knew it not, and in derision called it _the English monster_.\"\r\nAn exact parallel this of many of our own Parisian modes in the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis was the golden period of cosmetics. The beaux of that day, it is\r\nevident, used the abominable art of painting their faces as well as the\r\nwomen. Our old comedies abound with perpetual allusions to oils,\r\ntinctures, quintessences, pomatums, perfumes, paint white and red, &c.\r\nOne of their prime cosmetics was a frequent use of the _bath_, and the\r\napplication of _wine_. Strutt quotes from an old MS. a recipe to make\r\nthe face of a beautiful red colour. The person was to be in a bath that\r\nhe might perspire, and afterwards wash his face with wine, and \"so\r\nshould be both faire and roddy.\" In Mr. Lodge's \"Illustrations of\r\nBritish History,\" the Earl of Shrewsbury, who had the keeping of the\r\nunfortunate Queen of Scots, complains of the expenses of the queen for\r\n_bathing in wine_, and requires a further allowance. A learned Scotch\r\nprofessor informed me that _white wine_ was used for these purposes.\r\nThey also made a bath of _milk_. Elder beauties _bathed in wine_, to get\r\nrid of their wrinkles; and perhaps not without reason, wine being a\r\ngreat astringent. Unwrinkled beauties _bathed in milk_, to preserve the\r\nsoftness and sleekness of the skin. Our venerable beauties of the\r\nElizabethan age were initiated coquettes; and the mysteries of their\r\ntoilet might be worth unveiling.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Charles II. was the dominion of French fashions. In some\r\nrespects the taste was a little lighter, but the moral effect of dress,\r\nand which no doubt it has, was much worse. The dress was very\r\ninflammatory; and the nudity of the beauties of the portrait-painter,\r\nSir Peter Lely, has been observed. The queen of Charles II. exposed her\r\nbreast and shoulders without even the gloss of the lightest gauze; and\r\nthe tucker, instead of standing up on her bosom, is with licentious\r\nboldness turned down, and lies upon her stays. This custom of baring the\r\nbosom was much exclaimed against by the authors of that age. That honest\r\ndivine, Richard Baxter, wrote a preface to a book, entitled, \"A just and\r\nseasonable reprehension of _naked breasts and shoulders_.\" In 1672 a\r\nbook was published, entitled, \"New instructions unto youth for their\r\nbehaviour, and also a discourse upon some innovations of habits and\r\ndressing; _against powdering of hair_, _naked breasts_, _black spots_\r\n(or patches), and other unseemly customs.\"A whimsical fashion now\r\nprevailed among the ladies, of strangely ornamenting their faces with\r\nabundance of black patches cut into grotesque forms, such as a coach and\r\nhorses, owls, rings, suns, moons, crowns, cross and crosslets. The\r\nauthor has prefixed _two ladies' heads_; the one representing _Virtue_,\r\nand the other _Vice_. _Virtue_ is a lady modestly habited, with a black\r\nvelvet hood, and a plain white kerchief on her neck, with a border.\r\n_Vice_ wears no handkerchief; her stays cut low, so that they display\r\ngreat part of the breasts; and a variety of fantastical patches on her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe innovations of fashions in the reign of Charles II. were watched\r\nwith a jealous eye by the remains of those strict puritans, who now\r\ncould only pour out their bile in such solemn admonitions. They affected\r\nall possible plainness and sanctity. When courtiers wore monstrous wigs,\r\nthey cut their hair short; when they adopted hats with broad plumes,\r\nthey clapped on round black caps, and screwed up their pale religious\r\nfaces; and when shoe-buckles were revived, they wore strings. The\r\nsublime Milton, perhaps, exulted in his intrepidity of still wearing\r\nlatchets! The Tatler ridicules Sir William Whitelocke for his\r\nsingularity in still affecting them. \"Thou dear _Will Shoestring_, how\r\nshall I draw thee? Thou dear outside, will you be _combing your wig_,\r\nplaying with your _box_, or picking your teeth?\" &c. _Wigs_ and\r\n_snuff-boxes_ were then the rage. Steele's own wig, it is recorded, made\r\nat one time a considerable part of his annual expenditure. His large\r\nblack periwig cost him, even at that day, no less than forty\r\nguineas!--We wear nothing at present in this degree of extravagance. But\r\nsuch a wig was the idol of fashion, and they were performing perpetually\r\ntheir worship with infinite self-complacency; combing their wigs in\r\npublic was then the very spirit of gallantry and rank. The hero of\r\nRichardson, youthful and elegant as he wished him to be, is represented\r\nwaiting at an assignation, and describing his sufferings in bad weather\r\nby lamenting that \"his _wig_ and his linen were dripping with the hoar\r\nfrost dissolving on them.\" Even Betty, Clarissa's lady's-maid, is\r\ndescribed as \"tapping on her _snuff-box_,\" and frequently taking\r\n_snuff_. At this time nothing was so monstrous as the head-dresses of\r\nthe ladies in Queen Anne's reign: they formed a kind of edifice of three\r\nstories high; and a fashionable lady of that day much resembles the\r\nmythological figure of Cybele, the mother of the gods, with three towers\r\non her head.[66]\r\n\r\nIt is not worth noticing the changes in fashion, unless to ridicule\r\nthem. However, there are some who find amusement in these records of\r\nluxurious idleness; these thousand and one follies! Modern fashions,\r\ntill, very lately, a purer taste has obtained among our females, were\r\ngenerally mere copies of obsolete ones, and rarely originally\r\nfantastical. The dress of _some_ of our _beaux_ will only be known in a\r\nfew years hence by their _caricatures_. In 1751 the dress of a _dandy_\r\nis described in the Inspector. A _black_ velvet coat, a _green_ and\r\nsilver waistcoat, _yellow_ velvet breeches, and _blue_ stockings. This\r\ntoo was the æra of _black silk breeches_; an extraordinary novelty\r\nagainst which \"some frowsy people attempted to raise up _worsted_ in\r\nemulation.\" A satirical writer has described a buck about forty years\r\nago;[67] one could hardly have suspected such a gentleman to have been\r\none of our contemporaries. \"A coat of light green, with sleeves too\r\nsmall for the arms, and buttons too big for the sleeves; a pair of\r\nManchester fine stuff breeches, without money in the pockets; clouded\r\nsilk stockings, but no legs; a club of hair behind larger than the head\r\nthat carries it; a hat of the size of sixpence on a block not worth a\r\nfarthing.\"\r\n\r\nAs this article may probably arrest the volatile eyes of my fair\r\nreaders, let me be permitted to felicitate them on their improvement in\r\nelegance in the forms of their dress; and the taste and knowledge of art\r\nwhich they frequently exhibit. But let me remind them that there are\r\nuniversal principles of beauty in dress independent of all fashions.\r\nTacitus remarks of Poppea, the consort of Nero, that she concealed _a\r\npart of her face_; to the end that, the imagination having fuller play\r\nby irritating curiosity, they might think higher of her beauty than if\r\nthe whole of her face had been exposed. The sentiment is beautifully\r\nexpressed by Tasso, and it will not be difficult to remember it:--\r\n\r\n    \"Non copre sue bellezze, e non l'espose.\"\r\n\r\nI conclude by a poem, written in my youth, not only because the late Sir\r\nWalter Scott once repeated some of the lines, from memory, to remind me\r\nof it, and has preserved it in \"The English Minstrelsy,\" but also as a\r\nmemorial of some fashions which have become extinct in my own days.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANZAS\r\n\r\nADDRESSED TO LAURA, ENTREATING HER NOT TO PAINT, TO POWDER, OR TO GAME,\r\nBUT TO RETREAT INTO THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n    AH, LAURA! quit the noisy town,\r\n      And FASHION'S persecuting reign:\r\n    Health wanders on the breezy down,\r\n      And Science on the silent plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n    How long from Art's reflected hues\r\n      Shalt thou a mimic charm receive?\r\n    Believe, my fair! the faithful muse,\r\n      They spoil the blush they cannot give.\r\n\r\n    Must ruthless art, with tortuous steel,\r\n      Thy artless locks of gold deface,\r\n    In serpent folds their charms conceal,\r\n      And spoil, at every touch, a grace.\r\n\r\n    Too sweet thy youth's enchanting bloom\r\n      To waste on midnight's sordid crews:\r\n    Let wrinkled age the night consume,\r\n      For age has but its hoards to lose.\r\n\r\n    Sacred to love and sweet repose,\r\n      Behold that trellis'd bower is nigh!\r\n    That bower the verdant walls enclose,\r\n      Safe from pursuing Scandal's eye.\r\n\r\n    There, as in every lock of gold\r\n      Some flower of pleasing hue I weave,\r\n    A goddess shall the muse behold,\r\n      And many a votive sigh shall heave.\r\n\r\n    So the rude Tartar's holy rite\r\n      A feeble MORTAL once array'd;\r\n    Then trembled in that mortal's sight,\r\n      And own'd DIVINE the power he MADE.[68]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: It consisted of three borders of lace of different depths,\r\nset one above the other, and was called a _Fontange_, from its inventor,\r\nMademoiselle Font-Ange, a lady of the Court of Louis XIV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: This was written in 1790.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SENATE OF JESUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a book entitled \"Intérêts et Maximes des Princes et des Etats\r\nSouverains, par M. le duc de Rohan; Cologne, 1666,\" an anecdote is\r\nrecorded concerning the Jesuits, which neither Puffendorf nor Vertot has\r\nnoticed in his history.\r\n\r\nWhen Sigismond, king of Sweden, was elected king of Poland, he made a\r\ntreaty with the states of Sweden, by which he obliged himself to pass\r\nevery fifth year in that kingdom. By his wars with the Ottoman court,\r\nwith Muscovy, and Tartary, compelled to remain in Poland to encounter\r\nthese powerful enemies, during fifteen years he failed in accomplishing\r\nhis promise. To remedy this in some shape, by the advice of the Jesuits,\r\nwho had gained an ascendancy over him, he created a senate to reside at\r\nStockholm, composed of forty chosen Jesuits. He presented them with\r\nletters-patent, and invested them with the royal authority.\r\n\r\nWhile this senate of Jesuits was at Dantzic, waiting for a fair wind to\r\nset sail for Stockholm, he published an edict, that the Swedes should\r\nreceive them as his own royal person. A public council was immediately\r\nheld. Charles, the uncle of Sigismond, the prelates, and the lords,\r\nresolved to prepare for them a splendid and magnificent entry.\r\n\r\nBut in a private council, they came to very contrary resolutions: for\r\nthe prince said, he could not bear that a senate of priests should\r\ncommand, in preference to all the princes and lords, natives of the\r\ncountry. All the others agreed with him in rejecting this holy senate.\r\nThe archbishop rose, and said, \"Since Sigismond has disdained to be our\r\nking, we also must not acknowledge him as such; and from this moment we\r\nshould no longer consider ourselves as his subjects. His authority is\r\n_in suspenso_, because he has bestowed it on the Jesuits who form this\r\nsenate. The people have not yet acknowledged them. In this interval of\r\nresignation on the one side, and assumption on the other, I absolve you\r\nall of the fidelity the king may claim from you as his Swedish\r\nsubjects.\" The prince of Bithynia addressing himself to Prince Charles,\r\nuncle of the king, said, \"I own no other king than you; and I believe\r\nyou are now obliged to receive us as your affectionate subjects, and to\r\nassist us to hunt these vermin from the state.\" All the others joined\r\nhim, and acknowledged Charles as their lawful monarch.\r\n\r\nHaving resolved to keep their declaration for some time secret, they\r\ndeliberated in what manner they were to receive and to precede this\r\nsenate in their entry into the harbour, who were now on board a great\r\ngalleon, which had anchored two leagues from Stockholm, that they might\r\nenter more magnificently in the night, when the fireworks they had\r\nprepared would appear to the greatest advantage. About the time of their\r\nreception, Prince Charles, accompanied by twenty-five or thirty vessels,\r\nappeared before this senate. Wheeling about, and forming a caracol of\r\nships, they discharged a volley, and emptied all their cannon on the\r\ngalleon bearing this senate, which had its sides pierced through with\r\nthe balls. The galleon immediately filled with water and sunk, without\r\none of the unfortunate Jesuits being assisted: on the contrary, their\r\nassailants cried to them that this was the time to perform some miracle,\r\nsuch as they were accustomed to do in India and Japan; and if they\r\nchose, they could walk on the waters!\r\n\r\nThe report of the cannon, and the smoke which the powder occasioned,\r\nprevented either the cries or the submersion of the holy fathers from\r\nbeing observed: and as if they were conducting the senate to the town,\r\nCharles entered triumphantly; went into the church, where they sung _Te\r\nDeum_; and to conclude the night, he partook of the entertainment which\r\nhad been prepared for this ill-fated senate.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits of the city of Stockholm having come, about midnight, to pay\r\ntheir respects to the Fathers, perceived their loss. They directly\r\nposted up _placards_ of excommunication against Charles and his\r\nadherents, who had caused the senate of Jesuits to perish. They urged\r\nthe people to rebel; but they were soon expelled the city, and Charles\r\nmade a public profession of Lutheranism.\r\n\r\nSigismond, King of Poland, began a war with Charles in 1604, which\r\nlasted two years. Disturbed by the invasions of the Tartars, the\r\nMuscovites, and the Cossacs, a truce was concluded; but Sigismond lost\r\nboth his crowns, by his bigoted attachment to Roman Catholicism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: The _Lama_, or God of the Tartars, is composed of such\r\nfrail materials as mere mortality; contrived, however, by the power of\r\npriestcraft, to appear immortal; the _succession of Lamas_ never\r\nfailing!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOVER'S HEART.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following tale, recorded in the Historical Memoirs of Champagne, by\r\nBougier, has been a favourite narrative with the old romance writers;\r\nand the principal incident, however objectionable, has been displayed in\r\nseveral modern poems.\r\n\r\nHowell, in his \"Familiar Letters,\" in one addressed to Ben Jonson,\r\nrecommends it to him as a subject \"which peradventure you may make use\r\nof in your way;\" and concludes by saying, \"in my opinion, which vails to\r\nyours, this is choice and rich stuff for you to put upon your loom, and\r\nmake a curious web of.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lord de Coucy, vassal to the Count de Champagne, was one of the most\r\naccomplished youths of his time. He loved, with an excess of passion,\r\nthe lady of the Lord du Fayel, who felt a reciprocal affection. With the\r\nmost poignant grief this lady heard from her lover, that he had resolved\r\nto accompany the king and the Count de Champagne to the wars of the Holy\r\nLand; but she would not oppose his wishes, because she hoped that his\r\nabsence might dissipate the jealousy of her husband. The time of\r\ndeparture having come, these two lovers parted with sorrows of the most\r\nlively tenderness. The lady, in quitting her lover, presented him with\r\nsome rings, some diamonds, and with a string that she had woven herself\r\nof his own hair, intermixed with silk and buttons of large pearls, to\r\nserve him, according to the fashion of those days, to tie a magnificent\r\nhood which covered his helmet. This he gratefully accepted.\r\n\r\nIn Palestine, at the siege of Acre, in 1191, in gloriously ascending the\r\nramparts, he received a wound, which was declared mortal. He employed\r\nthe few moments he had to live in writing to the Lady du Fayel; and he\r\npoured forth the fervour of his soul. He ordered his squire to embalm\r\nhis heart after his death, and to convey it to his beloved mistress,\r\nwith the presents he had received from her hands in quitting her.\r\n\r\nThe squire, faithful to the dying injunction of his master, returned to\r\nFrance, to present the heart and the gifts to the lady of Du Fayel. But\r\nwhen he approached the castle of this lady, he concealed himself in the\r\nneighbouring wood, watching some favourable moment to complete his\r\npromise. He had the misfortune to be observed by the husband of this\r\nlady, who recognised him, and who immediately suspected he came in\r\nsearch of his wife with some message from his master. He threatened to\r\ndeprive him of his life if he did not divulge the occasion of his\r\nreturn. The squire assured him that his master was dead; but Du Fayel\r\nnot believing it, drew his sword on him. This man, frightened at the\r\nperil in which he found himself, confessed everything; and put into his\r\nhands the heart and letter of his master. Du Fayel was maddened by the\r\nfellest passions, and he took a wild and horrid revenge. He ordered his\r\ncook to mince the heart; and having mixed it with meat, he caused a\r\nfavourite ragout, which he knew pleased the taste of his wife, to be\r\nmade, and had it served to her. The lady ate heartily of the dish. After\r\nthe repast, Du Fayel inquired of his wife if she had found the ragout\r\naccording to her taste: she answered him that she had found it\r\nexcellent. \"It is for this reason that I caused it to be served to you,\r\nfor it is a kind of meat which you very much liked. You have, Madame,\"\r\nthe savage Du Fayel continued, \"eaten the heart of the Lord de Coucy.\"\r\nBut this the lady would not believe, till he showed her the letter of\r\nher lover, with the string of his hair, and the diamonds she had given\r\nhim. Shuddering in the anguish of her sensations, and urged by the\r\nutmost despair, she told him--\"It is true that I loved that heart,\r\nbecause it merited to be loved: for never could it find its superior;\r\nand since I have eaten of so noble a meat, and that my stomach is the\r\ntomb of so precious a heart, I will take care that nothing of inferior\r\nworth shall ever be mixed with it.\" Grief and passion choked her\r\nutterance. She retired to her chamber: she closed the door for ever; and\r\nrefusing to accept of consolation or food, the amiable victim expired on\r\nthe fourth day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF GLOVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present learned and curious dissertation is compiled from the papers\r\nof an ingenious antiquary, from the \"Present State of the Republic of\r\nLetters,\" vol. x. p. 289.[69]\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of this part of dress will form our first inquiry; and we\r\nshall then show its various uses in the several ages of the world.\r\n\r\nIt has been imagined that gloves are noticed in the 108th Psalm, where\r\nthe royal prophet declares, he will cast his _shoe_ over Edom; and still\r\nfarther back, supposing them to be used in the times of the Judges, Ruth\r\niv. 7, where the custom is noticed of a man taking off his _shoe_ and\r\ngiving it to his neighbour, as a pledge for redeeming or exchanging\r\nanything. The word in these two texts, usually translated _shoe_ by the\r\nChaldee paraphrast, in the latter is rendered _glove_. Casaubon is of\r\nopinion that _gloves_ were worn by the Chaldeans, from the word here\r\nmentioned being explained in the Talmud Lexicon, _the clothing of the\r\nhand_.\r\n\r\n_Xenophon_ gives a clear and distinct account of _gloves_. Speaking of\r\nthe manners of the Persians, as a proof of their effeminacy, he\r\nobserves, that, not satisfied with covering their head and their feet,\r\nthey also guarded their hands against the cold with _thick gloves_.\r\n_Homer_, describing Laertes at work in his garden, represents him with\r\n_gloves on his hands, to secure them from the thorns_. _Varro_, an\r\nancient writer, is an evidence in favour of their antiquity among the\r\nRomans. In lib. ii. cap. 55, _De Re Rusticâ_, he says, that olives\r\ngathered by the naked hand are preferable to those gathered with\r\n_gloves_. _Athenæus_ speaks of a celebrated glutton who always came to\r\ntable with _gloves_ on his hands, that he might be able to handle and\r\neat the meat while hot, and devour more than the rest of the company.\r\n\r\nThese authorities show that the ancients were not strangers to the use\r\nof _gloves_, though their use was not common. In a hot climate to wear\r\ngloves implies a considerable degree of effeminacy. We can more clearly\r\ntrace the early use of gloves in northern than in southern nations. When\r\nthe ancient severity of manners declined, the use of _gloves_ prevailed\r\namong the Romans; but not without some opposition from the philosophers.\r\n_Musonius_, a philosopher, who lived at the close of the first century\r\nof Christianity, among other invectives against the corruption of the\r\nage, says, _It is shameful that persons in perfect health should clothe\r\ntheir hands and feet with soft and hairy coverings_. Their convenience,\r\nhowever, soon made the use general. _Pliny_ the younger informs us, in\r\nhis account of his uncle's journey to Vesuvius, that his secretary sat\r\nby him ready to write down whatever occurred remarkable; and that he had\r\n_gloves_ on his hands, that the coldness of the weather might not impede\r\nhis business.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the ninth century, the use of _gloves_ was become so\r\nuniversal, that even the church thought a regulation in that part of\r\ndress necessary. In the reign of _Louis le Debonair_, the council of Aix\r\nordered that the monks should only wear _gloves_ made of sheep-skin.\r\n\r\nThat time has made alterations in the form of this, as in all other\r\napparel, appears from the old pictures and monuments.\r\n\r\n_Gloves_, beside their original design for a covering of the hand, have\r\nbeen employed on several great and solemn occasions; as in the ceremony\r\nof _investitures_, in bestowing lands, or in conferring _dignities_.\r\nGiving possession by the delivery of a _glove_, prevailed in several\r\nparts of Christendom in later ages. In the year 1002, the bishops of\r\nPaderborn and Moncerco were put into possession of their sees by\r\nreceiving a _glove_. It was thought so essential a part of the episcopal\r\nhabit, that some abbots in France presuming to wear _gloves_, the\r\ncouncil of Poitiers interposed in the affair, and forbad them the use,\r\non the same principle as the ring and sandals; these being peculiar to\r\nbishops, who frequently wore them richly adorned with jewels.\r\n\r\nFavin observes, that the custom of blessing _gloves_ at the coronation\r\nof the kings of France, which still subsists, is a remain of the eastern\r\npractice of investiture by _a glove_. A remarkable instance of this\r\nceremony is recorded. The unfortunate _Conradin_ was deprived of his\r\ncrown and his life by the usurper _Mainfroy_. When having ascended the\r\nscaffold, the injured prince lamenting his hard fate, asserted his right\r\nto the crown, and, as a token of investiture, threw his _glove_ among\r\nthe crowd, intreating it might be conveyed to some of his relations, who\r\nwould revenge his death,--it was taken up by a knight, and brought to\r\nPeter, king of Aragon, who in virtue of this glove was afterwards\r\ncrowned at Palermo.\r\n\r\nAs the delivery of _gloves_ was once a part of the ceremony used in\r\ngiving possession, so the depriving a person of them was a mark of\r\ndivesting him of his office, and of degradation. The Earl of Carlisle,\r\nin the reign of Edward the Second, impeached of holding a correspondence\r\nwith the Scots, was condemned to die as a traitor. Walsingham, relating\r\nother circumstances of his degradation, says, \"His spurs were cut off\r\nwith a hatchet; and his _gloves_ and shoes were taken off,\" &c.\r\n\r\nAnother use of _gloves_ was in a duel; he who threw one down was by this\r\nact understood to give defiance, and he who took it up to accept the\r\nchallenge.[70]\r\n\r\nThe use of single combat, at first designed only for a trial of\r\ninnocence, like the ordeals of fire and water, was in succeeding ages\r\npractised for deciding rights and property. Challenging by the _glove_\r\nwas continued down to the reign of Elizabeth, as appears by an account\r\ngiven by Spelman of a duel appointed to be fought in Tothill Fields, in\r\nthe year 1571. The dispute was concerning some lands in the county of\r\nKent. The plaintiffs appeared in court, and demanded single combat. One\r\nof them threw down his _glove_, which the other immediately taking up,\r\ncarried off on the point of his sword, and the day of fighting was\r\nappointed; this affair was, however, adjusted by the queen's judicious\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony is still practised of challenging by a _glove_ at the\r\ncoronations of the kings of England, by his majesty's champion entering\r\nWestminster Hall completely armed and mounted.\r\n\r\nChallenging by the _glove_ is still in use in some parts of the world.\r\nIn Germany, on receiving an affront, to send a _glove_ to the offending\r\nparty is a challenge to a duel.\r\n\r\nThe last use of _gloves_ was for carrying the _hawk_. In former times,\r\nprinces and other great men took so much pleasure in carrying the hawk\r\non their hand, that some of them have chosen to be represented in this\r\nattitude. There is a monument of Philip the First of France, on which he\r\nis represented at length, on his tomb, holding a _glove_ in his hand.\r\n\r\nChambers says that, formerly, judges were forbid to wear _gloves_ on the\r\nbench. No reason is assigned for this prohibition. Our judges lie under\r\nno such restraint; for both they and the rest of the court make no\r\ndifficulty of receiving _gloves_ from the sheriffs, whenever the session\r\nor assize concludes without any one receiving sentence of death, which\r\nis called a _maiden assize_; a custom of great antiquity.\r\n\r\nOur curious antiquary has preserved a singular anecdote concerning\r\n_gloves_. Chambers informs us, that it is not safe at present to enter\r\nthe stables of princes without pulling off our _gloves_. He does not\r\ntell us in what the danger consists; but it is an ancient established\r\ncustom in Germany, that whoever enters the stables of a prince, or great\r\nman, with his _gloves_ on his hands, is obliged to forfeit them, or\r\nredeem them by a fee to the servants. The same custom is observed in\r\nsome places at the death of the stag; in which case, if the _gloves_ are\r\nnot taken off, they are redeemed by money given to the huntsmen and\r\nkeepers. The French king never failed of pulling off one of his _gloves_\r\non that occasion. The reason of this ceremony seems to be lost.\r\n\r\nWe meet with the term _glove-money_ in our old records; by which is\r\nmeant, money given to servants to buy _gloves_. This, probably, is the\r\norigin of the phrase _giving a pair of gloves_, to signify making a\r\npresent for some favour or service.\r\n\r\nGough, in his \"Sepulchral Monuments,\" informs us that gloves formed no\r\npart of the female dress till after the Reformation.[71] I have seen\r\nsome as late as the time of Anne richly worked and embroidered.\r\n\r\nThere must exist in the Denny family some of the oldest gloves extant,\r\nas appears by the following glove anecdote.\r\n\r\nAt the sale of the Earl of Arran's goods, April 6th, 1759, the gloves\r\ngiven by Henry VIII. to Sir Anthony Denny were sold for 38_l._ 17_s._;\r\nthose given by James I. to his son Edward Denny for 22_l._ 4_s._; the\r\nmittens given by Queen Elizabeth to Sir Edward Denny's lady, 25_l._\r\n4_s._; all which were bought for Sir Thomas Denny, of Ireland, who was\r\ndescended in a direct line from the great Sir Anthony Denny, one of the\r\nexecutors of the will of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: In 1834 was published a curious little volume by William\r\nHull, \"The History of the Glove Trade, with the Customs connected with\r\nthe Glove,\" which adds some interesting information to the present\r\narticle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: A still more curious use for gloves was proposed by the\r\nMarquis of Worcester, in his \"Century of Inventions,\" 1659; it was to\r\nmake them with \"knotted silk strings, to signify any letter,\" or \"pinked\r\nwith the alphabet,\" that they might by this means be subservient to the\r\npractice of secret correspondence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: This is an extraordinary mistake for so accurate an\r\nantiquary to make. They occur on monumental effigies, or brasses; also\r\nin illuminated manuscripts, continually from the Saxon era; as may be\r\nseen in Strutt's plates to any of his books.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELICS OF SAINTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen relics of saints were first introduced, the relique-mania was\r\nuniversal; they bought and they sold, and, like other collectors, made\r\nno scruple to _steal_ them. It is entertaining to observe the singular\r\nardour and grasping avidity of some, to enrich themselves with these\r\nreligious morsels; their little discernment, the curious impositions of\r\nthe vendor, and the good faith and sincerity of the purchaser. The\r\nprelate of the place sometimes ordained a fast to implore God that they\r\nmight not be cheated with the relics of saints, which he sometimes\r\npurchased for the holy benefit of the village or town.\r\n\r\nGuibert de Nogent wrote a treatise on the relics of saints;\r\nacknowledging that there were many false ones, as well as false legends,\r\nhe reprobates the inventors of these lying miracles. He wrote his\r\ntreatise on the occasion of _a tooth_ of our Lord's, by which the monks\r\nof St. Medard de Soissons pretended to operate miracles. He asserts that\r\nthis pretension is as chimerical as that of several persons, who\r\nbelieved they possessed the navel, and other parts less decent, of--the\r\nbody of Christ!\r\n\r\nA monk of Bergsvinck has given a history of the translation of St.\r\nLewin, a virgin and a martyr: her relics were brought from England to\r\nBergs. He collected with religious care the facts from his brethren,\r\nespecially from the conductor of these relics from England. After the\r\nhistory of the translation, and a panegyric of the saint, he relates the\r\nmiracles performed in Flanders since the arrival of her relics. The\r\nprevailing passion of the times to possess fragments of saints is well\r\nmarked, when the author particularises with a certain complacency all\r\nthe knavish modes they used to carry off those in question. None then\r\nobjected to this sort of robbery; because the gratification of the\r\nreigning passion had made it worth while to supply the demand.\r\n\r\nA monk of Cluny has given a history of the translation of the body of\r\nSt. Indalece, one of the earliest Spanish bishops, written by order of\r\nthe abbot of St. Juan de la Penna. He protests he advances nothing but\r\nfacts: having himself seen, or learnt from other witnesses, all he\r\nrelates. It was not difficult for him to be well informed, since it was\r\nto the monastery of St. Juan de la Penna that the holy relics were\r\ntransported, and those who brought them were two monks of that house. He\r\nhas authenticated his minute detail of circumstances by giving the names\r\nof persons and places. His account was written for the great festival\r\nimmediately instituted in honour of this translation. He informs us of\r\nthe miraculous manner by which they were so fortunate as to discover the\r\nbody of this bishop, and the different plans they concerted to carry it\r\noff. He gives the itinerary of the two monks who accompanied the holy\r\nremains. They were not a little cheered in their long journey by visions\r\nand miracles.\r\n\r\nAnother has written a history of what he calls the translation of the\r\nrelics of St. Majean to the monastery of Villemagne. _Translation_ is,\r\nin fact, only a softened expression for the robbery of the relics of the\r\nsaint committed by two monks, who carried them off secretly to enrich\r\ntheir monastery; and they did not hesitate at any artifice or lie to\r\ncomplete their design. They thought everything was permitted to acquire\r\nthese fragments of mortality, which had now become a branch of commerce.\r\nThey even regarded their possessors with an hostile eye. Such was the\r\nreligious opinion from the ninth to the twelfth century. Our Canute\r\ncommissioned his agent at Rome to purchase _St. Augustin's arm_ for one\r\nhundred talents of silver and one of gold; a much greater sum, observes\r\nGranger, than the finest statue of antiquity would have then sold for.\r\n\r\nAnother monk describes a strange act of devotion, attested by several\r\ncontemporary writers. When the saints did not readily comply with the\r\nprayers of their votaries, they flogged their relics with rods, in a\r\nspirit of impatience which they conceived was necessary to make them\r\nbend into compliance.\r\n\r\nTheofroy, abbot of Epternac, to raise our admiration, relates the daily\r\nmiracles performed by the relics of saints, their ashes, their clothes,\r\nor other mortal spoils, and even by the instruments of their martyrdom.\r\nHe inveighs against that luxury of ornaments which was indulged under\r\nreligious pretext: \"It is not to be supposed that the saints are\r\ndesirous of such a profusion of gold and silver. They care not that we\r\nshould raise to them such magnificent churches, to exhibit that\r\ningenious order of pillars which shine with gold, nor those rich\r\nceilings, nor those altars sparkling with jewels. They desire not the\r\npurple parchment of price for their writings, the liquid gold to\r\nembellish the letters, nor the precious stones to decorate their covers,\r\nwhile you have such little care for the ministers of the altar.\" The\r\npious writer has not forgotten _himself_ in this copartnership with _the\r\nsaints_.\r\n\r\nThe Roman church not being able to deny, says Bayle, that there have\r\nbeen false relics, which have operated miracles, they reply that the\r\ngood intentions of those believers who have recourse to them obtained\r\nfrom God this reward for their good faith! In the same spirit, when it\r\nwas shown that two or three bodies of the same saint was said to exist\r\nin different places, and that therefore they all could not be authentic,\r\nit was answered that they were all genuine; for God had multiplied and\r\nmiraculously reproduced them for the comfort of the faithful! A curious\r\nspecimen of the intolerance of good sense.\r\n\r\nWhen the Reformation was spread in Lithuania, Prince Radzivil was so\r\naffected by it, that he went in person to pay the pope all possible\r\nhonours. His holiness on this occasion presented him with a precious box\r\nof relics. The prince having returned home, some monks entreated\r\npermission to try the effects of these relics on a demoniac, who had\r\nhitherto resisted every kind of exorcism. They were brought into the\r\nchurch with solemn pomp, and deposited on the altar, accompanied by an\r\ninnumerable crowd. After the usual conjurations, which were\r\nunsuccessful, they applied the relics. The demoniac instantly recovered.\r\nThe people called out \"_a miracle!_\" and the prince, lifting his hands\r\nand eyes to heaven, felt his faith confirmed. In this transport of pious\r\njoy, he observed that a young gentleman, who was keeper of this treasure\r\nof relics, smiled, and by his motions ridiculed the miracle. The prince\r\nindignantly took our young keeper of the relics to task; who, on promise\r\nof pardon, gave the following _secret intelligence_ concerning them. In\r\ntravelling from Rome he had lost the box of relics; and not daring to\r\nmention it, he had procured a similar one, which he had filled with the\r\nsmall bones of dogs and cats, and other trifles similar to what were\r\nlost. He hoped he might be forgiven for smiling, when he found that such\r\na collection of rubbish was idolized with such pomp, and had even the\r\nvirtue of expelling demons. It was by the assistance of this box that\r\nthe prince discovered the gross impositions of the monks and the\r\ndemoniacs, and Radzivil afterwards became a zealous Lutheran.\r\n\r\nThe elector Frederic, surnamed _the Wise_, was an indefatigable\r\ncollector of relics. After his death, one of the monks employed by him\r\nsolicited payment for several parcels he had purchased for our _wise_\r\nelector; but the times had changed! He was advised to give over this\r\nbusiness; the relics for which he desired payment they were willing _to\r\nreturn_; that the price had fallen considerably since the reformation of\r\nLuther; and that they would find a _better market_ in Italy than in\r\nGermany!\r\n\r\nOur Henry III., who was deeply tainted with the superstition of the age,\r\nsummoned all the great in the kingdom to meet in London. This summons\r\nexcited the most general curiosity, and multitudes appeared. The king\r\nthen acquainted them that the great master of the Knights Templars had\r\nsent him a phial containing _a small portion of the precious blood of\r\nChrist_ which he had shed upon the _cross_; and _attested to be genuine_\r\nby the seals of the patriarch of Jerusalem and others! He commanded a\r\nprocession the following day; and the historian adds, that though the\r\nroad between St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey was very deep and miry,\r\nthe king kept his eyes constantly fixed on the phial. Two monks received\r\nit, and deposited the phial in the abbey, \"which made all England shine\r\nwith glory, dedicating it to God and St. Edward.\"\r\n\r\nLord Herbert, in his Life of Henry VIII., notices the _great fall of the\r\nprice of relics_ at the dissolution of the monasteries. \"The respect\r\ngiven to relics, and some pretended miracles, fell; insomuch, as I find\r\nby our records, that _a piece of St. Andrew's finger_ (covered only with\r\nan ounce of silver), being laid to pledge by a monastery for forty\r\npounds, was left unredeemed at the dissolution of the house; the king's\r\ncommissioners, who upon surrender of any foundation undertook to pay the\r\ndebts, refusing to return the price again.\" That is, they did not\r\nchoose to repay the _forty pounds_, to receive _apiece of the finger of\r\nSt. Andrew_.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the property of relics suddenly sunk to a South-sea\r\nbubble; for shortly after the artifice of the Rood of Grace, at Boxley,\r\nin Kent, was fully opened to the eye of the populace; and a far-famed\r\nrelic at Hales, in Gloucestershire, of the blood of Christ, was at the\r\nsame time exhibited. It was shown in a phial, and it was believed that\r\nnone could see it who were in mortal sin; and after many trials usually\r\nrepeated to the same person, the deluded pilgrims at length went away\r\nfully satisfied. This relic was the _blood of a duck_, renewed every\r\nweek, and put in a phial; one side was _opaque_, and the other\r\n_transparent_; the monk turned either side to the pilgrim, as he thought\r\nproper. The success of the pilgrim depended on the oblations he made;\r\nthose who were scanty in their offerings were the longest to get a sight\r\nof the blood: when a man was in despair, he usually became generous!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERPETUAL LAMPS OF THE ANCIENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 379 of the Spectator relates an anecdote of a person who had opened\r\nthe sepulchre of the famous Rosicrucius. He discovered a lamp burning,\r\nwhich a statue of clock-work struck into pieces. Hence, the disciples of\r\nthis visionary said that he made use of this method to show \"that he had\r\nre-invented the ever-burning lamps of the ancients.\"\r\n\r\nMany writers have made mention of these wonderful lamps.\r\n\r\nIt has happened frequently that inquisitive men examining with a\r\nflambeau ancient sepulchres which had been just opened, the fat and\r\ngross vapours kindled as the flambeau approached them, to the great\r\nastonishment of the spectators, who frequently cried out \"_a miracle!_\"\r\nThis sudden inflammation, although very natural, has given room to\r\nbelieve that these flames proceeded from _perpetual lamps_, which some\r\nhave thought were placed in the tombs of the ancients, and which, they\r\nsaid, were extinguished at the moment that these tombs opened, and were\r\npenetrated by the exterior air.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the perpetual lamps which ancient writers give have\r\noccasioned several ingenious men to search after their composition.\r\nLicetus, who possessed more erudition than love of truth, has given two\r\nreceipts for making this eternal fire by a preparation of certain\r\nminerals. More credible writers maintain that it is possible to make\r\nlamps perpetually burning, and an oil at once inflammable and\r\ninconsumable; but Boyle, assisted by several experiments made on the\r\nair-pump, found that these lights, which have been viewed in opening\r\ntombs, proceeded from the collision of fresh air. This reasonable\r\nobservation conciliates all, and does not compel us to deny the\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nThe story of the lamp of Rosicrucius, even if it ever had the slightest\r\nfoundation, only owes its origin to the spirit of party, which at the\r\ntime would have persuaded the world that Rosicrucius had at least\r\ndiscovered something.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for modern discoveries in chemistry to prove that air\r\nwas not only necessary for a medium to the existence of the flame, which\r\nindeed the air-pump had already shown; but also as a constituent part of\r\nthe inflammation, and without which a body, otherwise very inflammable\r\nin all its parts, cannot, however, burn but in its superficies, which\r\nalone is in contact with the ambient air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS RESEMBLING ARTIFICIAL COMPOSITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome stones are preserved by the curious, for representing distinctly\r\nfigures traced by nature alone, and without the aid of art.\r\n\r\nPliny mentions an agate, in which appeared, formed by the hand of\r\nnature, Apollo amidst the Nine Muses holding a harp. At Venice another\r\nmay be seen, in which is naturally formed the perfect figure of a man.\r\nAt Pisa, in the church of St. John, there is a similar natural\r\nproduction, which represents an old hermit in a desert, seated by the\r\nside of a stream, and who holds in his hands a small bell, as St.\r\nAnthony is commonly painted. In the temple of St. Sophia, at\r\nConstantinople, there was formerly on a white marble the image of St.\r\nJohn the Baptist covered with the skin of a camel; with this only\r\nimperfection, that nature had given but one leg. At Ravenna, in the\r\nchurch of St. Vital, a cordelier is seen on a dusky stone. They found in\r\nItaly a marble, in which a crucifix was so elaborately finished, that\r\nthere appeared the nails, the drops of blood, and the wounds, as\r\nperfectly as the most excellent painter could have performed. At\r\nSneilberg, in Germany, they found in a mine a certain rough metal, on\r\nwhich was seen the figure of a man, who carried a child on his back. In\r\nProvence they found in a mine a quantity of natural figures of birds,\r\ntrees, rats, and serpents; and in some places of the western parts of\r\nTartary, are seen on divers rocks the figures of camels, horses, and\r\nsheep. Pancirollus, in his Lost Antiquities, attests, that in a church\r\nat Rome, a marble perfectly represented a priest celebrating mass, and\r\nraising the host. Paul III. conceiving that art had been used, scraped\r\nthe marble to discover whether any painting had been employed: but\r\nnothing of the kind was discovered. \"I have seen,\" writes a friend,\r\n\"many of these curiosities. They are _always helped out_ by art. In my\r\nfather's house was a gray marble chimney-piece, which abounded in\r\nportraits, landscapes, &c., the greatest part of which was made by\r\nmyself.\" I have myself seen a large collection, many certainly untouched\r\nby art. One stone appears like a perfect cameo of a Minerva's head;\r\nanother shows an old man's head, beautiful as if the hand of Raffaelle\r\nhad designed it. Both these stones are transparent. Some exhibit\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\nThere is preserved in the British Museum a black stone, on which nature\r\nhas sketched a resemblance of the portrait of Chaucer.[72] Stones of\r\nthis kind, possessing a sufficient degree of resemblance, are rare; but\r\nart appears not to have been used. Even in plants, we find this sort of\r\nresemblance. There is a species of the orchis, where Nature has formed a\r\nbee, apparently feeding in the breast of the flower, with so much\r\nexactness, that it is impossible at a very small distance to distinguish\r\nthe imposition. Hence the plant derives its name, and is called the\r\nBEE-FLOWER. Langhorne elegantly notices its appearance:--\r\n\r\n        See on that flow'ret's velvet breast,\r\n          How close the busy vagrant lies!\r\n        His thin-wrought plume, his downy breast,\r\n           The ambrosial gold that swells his thighs.\r\n\r\n        Perhaps his fragrant load may bind\r\n           His limbs;--we'll set the captive free--\r\n        I sought the LIVING BEE to find,\r\n           And found the PICTURE of a BEE.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Jackson, of Exeter, wrote to me on this subject: \"This\r\norchis is common near our sea-coasts; but instead of being exactly like\r\na BEE, _it is not like it at all_. It has a general resemblance to a\r\n_fly_, and by the help of imagination may be supposed to be a fly\r\npitched upon the flower. The mandrake very frequently has a forked root,\r\nwhich may be fancied to resemble thighs and legs. I have seen it helped\r\nout with nails on the toes.\"\r\n\r\nAn ingenious botanist, after reading this article, was so kind as to\r\nsend me specimens of the _fly_ orchis, _ophrys muscifera_, and of the\r\n_bee_ orchis, _ophrys apifera_. Their resemblance to these insects when\r\nin full flower is the most perfect conceivable: they are distinct\r\nplants. The poetical eye of Langhorne was equally correct and fanciful;\r\nand that too of Jackson, who differed so positively. Many controversies\r\nhave been carried on, from a want of a little more knowledge; like that\r\nof the BEE _orchis_ and the FLY _orchis_, both parties prove to be\r\nright.\r\n\r\nAnother curious specimen of the playful operations of nature is the\r\nmandrake; a plant, indeed, when it is bare of leaves, perfectly\r\nresembling that of the human form. The ginseng tree is noticed for the\r\nsame appearance. This object the same poet has noticed:--\r\n\r\n    Mark how that rooted mandrake wears\r\n       His human feet, his human hands;\r\n    Oft, as his shapely form he rears,\r\n       Aghast the frighted ploughman stands.\r\n\r\nHe closes this beautiful fable with the following stanza not inapposite\r\nto the curious subject of this article:\r\n\r\n    Helvetia's rocks, Sabrina's waves,\r\n       Still many a shining pebble bear:\r\n    Where nature's studious hand engraves\r\n       The PERFECT FORM, and leaves it there.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: One of the most curious of these natural portraits is the\r\nenormous rock in Wales, known as the Pitt Stone. It is an immense\r\nfragment, the outline bearing a perfect resemblance to the profile of\r\nthe great statesman. The frontispiece to Brace's \"Visit to Norway and\r\nSweden\" represents an island popularly known as \"The Horseman's Island,\"\r\nthat takes the form of a gigantic mounted horseman wading through the\r\ndeep. W.B. Cooke, the late eminent engraver, amused himself by depicting\r\na landscape with waterfalls and ruins, which, when turned on one side,\r\nformed a perfect human face.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POETICAL GARLAND OF JULIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuet has given a charming description of a present made by a lover to\r\nhis mistress; a gift which romance has seldom equalled for its\r\ngallantry, ingenuity, and novelty. It was called the garland of Julia.\r\nTo understand the nature of this gift, it will be necessary to give the\r\nhistory of the parties.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Julia d'Angennes was in the flower of her youth and fame,\r\nwhen the celebrated Gustavus, king of Sweden, was making war in Germany\r\nwith the most splendid success. Julia expressed her warm admiration of\r\nthis hero. She had his portrait placed on her toilet, and took pleasure\r\nin declaring that she would have no other lover than Gustavus. The Duke\r\nde Montausier was, however, her avowed and ardent admirer. A short time\r\nafter the death of Gustavus, he sent her, as a new-year's gift, the\r\nPOETICAL GARLAND of which the following is a description.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful flowers were painted in miniature by an eminent\r\nartist, one Robert, on pieces of vellum, all of equal dimensions. Under\r\nevery flower a space was left open for a madrigal on the subject of the\r\nflower there painted. The duke solicited the wits of the time to assist\r\nin the composition of these little poems, reserving a considerable\r\nnumber for the effusions of his own amorous muse. Under every flower he\r\nhad its madrigal written by N. Du Jarry, celebrated for his beautiful\r\ncaligraphy. A decorated frontispiece offered a splendid garland composed\r\nof all these twenty-nine flowers; and on turning the page a cupid is\r\npainted to the life. These were magnificently bound, and enclosed in a\r\nbag of rich Spanish leather. When Julia awoke on new-year's day, she\r\nfound this lover's gift lying on her toilet; it was one quite to her\r\ntaste, and successful to the donor's hopes.\r\n\r\nOf this Poetical Garland, thus formed by the hands of Wit and Love, Huet\r\nsays, \"As I had long heard of it, I frequently expressed a wish to see\r\nit: at length the Duchess of Usez gratified me with the sight. She\r\nlocked me in her cabinet one afternoon with this garland: she then went\r\nto the queen, and at the close of the evening liberated me. I never\r\npassed a more agreeable afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the prettiest inscriptions of these flowers is the following,\r\ncomposed for\r\n\r\n    THE VIOLET.\r\n\r\n    Modeste en ma couleur, modeste en mon séjour,\r\n    Franche d'ambition, je me cache sous l'herbe;\r\n    Mais, si sur votre front je puis me voir un jour,\r\n    La plus humble des fleurs sera la plus superbe.\r\n\r\n    Modest my colour, modest is my place,\r\n    Pleased in the grass my lowly form to hide;\r\n    But mid your tresses might I wind with grace,\r\n    The humblest flower would feel the loftiest pride.\r\n\r\nThe following is some additional information respecting \"the Poetical\r\nGarland of Julia.\"\r\n\r\nAt the sale of the library of the Duke de la Vallière, in 1784, among\r\nits numerous literary curiosities this garland appeared. It was actually\r\nsold for the extravagant sum of 14,510 livres! though in 1770, at\r\nGaignat's sale, it only cost 780 livres. It is described to be \"a\r\nmanuscript on vellum, composed of twenty-nine flowers painted by one\r\nRobert, under which are inserted madrigals by various authors.\" But the\r\nAbbé Rive, the superintendent of the Vallière library, published in 1779\r\nan inflammatory notice of this garland; and as he and the duke had the\r\nart of appreciating, and it has been said _making_ spurious literary\r\ncuriosities, this notice was no doubt the occasion of the maniacal\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nIn the great French Revolution, this literary curiosity found its\r\npassage into this country. A bookseller offered it for sale at the\r\nenormous price of 500_l._ sterling! No curious collector has been\r\ndiscovered to have purchased this unique; which is most remarkable for\r\nthe extreme folly of the purchaser who gave the 14,510 livres for poetry\r\nand painting not always exquisite. The history of the Garland of Julia\r\nis a child's lesson for certain rash and inexperienced collectors, who\r\nmay here\r\n\r\n    Learn to do well by others harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAGIC ACTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMontfleury, a French player, was one of the greatest actors of his time\r\nfor characters highly tragic. He died of the violent efforts he made in\r\nrepresenting Orestes in the Andromache of Racine. The author of the\r\n\"Parnasse Reformé\" makes him thus express himself in the shades. There\r\nis something extremely droll in his lamentations, with a severe\r\nraillery on the inconveniences to which tragic actors are liable.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! how sincerely do I wish that tragedies had never been invented! I\r\nmight then have been yet in a state capable of appearing on the stage;\r\nand if I should not have attained the glory of sustaining sublime\r\ncharacters, I should at least have trifled agreeably, and have worked\r\noff my spleen in laughing! I have wasted my lungs in the violent\r\nemotions of jealousy, love, and ambition. A thousand times have I been\r\nobliged to force myself to represent more passions than Le Brun ever\r\npainted or conceived. I saw myself frequently obliged to dart terrible\r\nglances; to roll my eyes furiously in my head, like a man insane; to\r\nfrighten others by extravagant grimaces; to imprint on my countenance\r\nthe redness of indignation and hatred; to make the paleness of fear and\r\nsurprise succeed each other by turns; to express the transports of rage\r\nand despair; to cry out like a demoniac: and consequently to strain all\r\nthe parts of my body to render my gestures fitter to accompany these\r\ndifferent impressions. The man then who would know of what I died, let\r\nhim not ask if it were of the fever, the dropsy, or the gout; but let\r\nhim know that it was of _the Andromache_!\"\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit Rapin informs us, that when Mondory acted Herod in the\r\nMariamne of Tristan, the spectators quitted the theatre mournful and\r\nthoughtful; so tenderly were they penetrated with the sorrows of the\r\nunfortunate heroine. In this melancholy pleasure, he says, we have a\r\nrude picture of the strong impressions which were made by the Grecian\r\ntragedians. Mondory indeed felt so powerfully the character he assumed,\r\nthat it cost him his life.\r\n\r\nSome readers may recollect the death of Bond, who felt so exquisitely\r\nthe character of Lusignan in Zara, which he personated when an old man,\r\nthat Zara, when she addressed him, found him _dead_ in his chair.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of a variety of characters by a person of irritable and\r\ndelicate nerves, has often a tragical effect on the mental faculties. We\r\nmight draw up a list of ACTORS, who have fallen martyrs to their tragic\r\ncharacters. Several have died on the stage, and, like Palmer, usually in\r\nthe midst of some agitated appeal to the feelings.[73]\r\n\r\nBaron, who was the French Garrick, had a most elevated notion of his\r\nprofession: he used to say, that tragic actors should be nursed on the\r\nlap of queens! Nor was his vanity inferior to his enthusiasm for his\r\nprofession; for, according to him, the world might see once in a century\r\na _Cæsar_, but that it required a thousand years to produce a _Baron_! A\r\nvariety of anecdotes testify the admirable talents he displayed.\r\nWhenever he meant to compliment the talents or merits of distinguished\r\ncharacters, he always delivered in a pointed manner the striking\r\npassages of the play, fixing his eye on them. An observation of his\r\nrespecting actors, is not less applicable to poets and to painters.\r\n\"RULES,\" said this sublime actor, \"may teach us not to raise the arms\r\nabove the head; but if PASSION carries them, it will be well done;\r\nPASSION KNOWS MORE THAN ART.\"\r\n\r\nBetterton, although his countenance was ruddy and sanguine, when he\r\nperformed Hamlet, through the violent and sudden emotion of amazement\r\nand horror at the presence of his father's spectre, instantly turned as\r\nwhite as his neckcloth, while his whole body seemed to be affected with\r\na strong tremor: had his father's apparition actually risen before him,\r\nhe could not have been seized with more real agonies. This struck the\r\nspectators so forcibly, that they felt a shuddering in their veins, and\r\nparticipated in the astonishment and the horror so apparent in the\r\nactor. Davies in his Dramatic Miscellanies records this fact; and in the\r\nRichardsoniana, we find that the first time Booth attempted the ghost\r\nwhen Betterton acted Hamlet, that actor's look at him struck him with\r\nsuch horror that he became disconcerted to such a degree, that he could\r\nnot speak his part. Here seems no want of evidence of the force of the\r\nideal presence in this marvellous acting: these facts might deserve a\r\nphilosophical investigation.\r\n\r\nLe Kain, the French actor, who retired from the Parisian stage, like our\r\nGarrick, covered with glory and gold, was one day congratulated by a\r\ncompany on the retirement which he was preparing to enjoy. \"As to\r\nglory,\" modestly replied this actor, \"I do not flatter myself to have\r\nacquired much. This kind of reward is always disputed by many, and you\r\nyourselves would not allow it, were I to assume it. As to the money, I\r\nhave not so much reason to be satisfied; at the Italian Theatre, their\r\nshare is far more considerable than mine; an actor there may get twenty\r\nto twenty-five thousand livres, and my share amounts at the most to ten\r\nor twelve thousand.\" \"How! the devil!\" exclaimed a rude chevalier of the\r\norder of St. Louis, who was present, \"How! the devil! a vile stroller is\r\nnot content with twelve thousand livres annually, and I, who am in the\r\nking's service, who sleep upon a cannon and lavish my blood for my\r\ncountry, I must consider myself as fortunate in having obtained a\r\npension of one thousand livres.\" \"And do you account as nothing, sir,\r\nthe liberty of addressing me thus?\" replied Le Kain, with all the\r\nsublimity and conciseness of an irritated Orosmane.\r\n\r\nThe memoirs of Mademoiselle Clairon display her exalted feeling of the\r\ncharacter of a sublime actress; she was of opinion, that in common life\r\nthe truly sublime actor should be a hero, or heroine off the stage. \"If\r\nI am only a vulgar and ordinary woman during twenty hours of the day,\r\nwhatever effort I may make, I shall only be an ordinary and vulgar woman\r\nin Agrippina or Semiramis, during the remaining four.\" In society she\r\nwas nicknamed the Queen of Carthage, from her admirable personification\r\nof Dido in a tragedy of that name.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Palmer's death took place on the Liverpool stage, August\r\n2, 1798; he was in the fifty-seventh year of his age. The death of his\r\nwife and his son had some time before thrown him into a profound\r\nmelancholy, and on this occasion he was unfortunately \"cast\" for the\r\nagitating part of \"the Stranger.\" He appeared unusually moved on\r\nuttering the words \"there is another and a better world,\" in the third\r\nact. In the first scene of the following act, when he was asked \"Why did\r\nyou not keep your children with you? they would have amused you in many\r\na dreary hour,\" he turned to reply--and \"for the space of about ten\r\nseconds, he paused as if waiting for the prompter to give him the\r\nword\"--says Mr. Whitfield the actor, who was then with him upon the\r\nstage--\"then put out his right hand, as if going to take hold of mine.\r\nIt dropt, as if to support his fall, but it had no power; in that\r\ninstant he fell, but not at full length, he crouched in falling, so that\r\nhis head did not strike the stage with great violence. He never breathed\r\nafter. I think I may venture to say he died without a pang.\" It is one\r\nof the most melancholy incidents connected with theatrical history.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOCULAR PREACHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese preachers, whose works are excessively rare, form a race unknown\r\nto the general reader. I shall sketch the characters of these pious\r\nbuffoons, before I introduce them to his acquaintance. They, as it has\r\nbeen said of Sterne, seemed to have wished, every now and then, to have\r\nthrown their wigs into the faces of their auditors.\r\n\r\nThese preachers flourished in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth\r\ncenturies; we are therefore to ascribe their extravagant mixture of\r\ngrave admonition with facetious illustration, comic tales which have\r\nbeen occasionally adopted by the most licentious writers, and minute and\r\nlively descriptions, to the great simplicity of the times, when the\r\ngrossest indecency was never concealed under a gentle periphrasis, but\r\neverything was called by its name. All this was enforced by the most\r\ndaring personalities, and seasoned by those temporary allusions which\r\nneither spared, nor feared even the throne. These ancient sermons\r\ntherefore are singularly precious, to those whose inquisitive pleasures\r\nare gratified by tracing the _manners_ of former ages. When Henry\r\nStephens, in his apology for Herodotus, describes the irregularities of\r\nthe age, and the minutiæ of national manners, he effects this chiefly by\r\nextracts from these sermons. Their wit is not always the brightest, nor\r\ntheir satire the most poignant; but there is always that prevailing\r\n_naïveté_ of the age running through their rude eloquence, which\r\ninterests the reflecting mind. In a word, these sermons were addressed\r\nto the multitude; and therefore they show good sense and absurdity;\r\nfancy and puerility; satire and insipidity; extravagance and truth.\r\n\r\nOliver Maillard, a famous cordelier, died in 1502. This preacher having\r\npointed some keen traits in his sermons at Louis XI., the irritated\r\nmonarch had our cordelier informed that he would throw him into the\r\nriver. He replied undaunted, and not forgetting his satire: \"The king\r\nmay do as he chooses; but tell him that I shall sooner get to paradise\r\nby water, than he will arrive by all his post-horses.\" He alluded to\r\ntravelling by post, which this monarch had lately introduced into\r\nFrance. This bold answer, it is said, intimidated Louis: it is certain\r\nthat Maillard continued as courageous and satirical as ever in his\r\npulpit.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are descriptive of the manners of the times.\r\n\r\nIn attacking rapine and robbery, under the first head he describes a\r\nkind of usury, which was practised in the days of Ben Jonson, and I am\r\ntold in the present, as well as in the times of Maillard. \"This,\" says\r\nhe, \"is called a palliated usury. It is thus. When a person is in want\r\nof money, he goes to a treasurer (a kind of banker or merchant), on whom\r\nhe has an order for 1000 crowns; the treasurer tells him that he will\r\npay him in a fortnight's time, when he is to receive the money. The\r\npoor man cannot wait. Our good treasurer tells him, I will give you half\r\nin money and half in goods. So he passes his goods that are worth 100\r\ncrowns for 200.\" He then touches on the bribes which these treasurers\r\nand clerks in office took, excusing themselves by alleging the little\r\npay they otherwise received. \"All these practices be sent to the\r\ndevils!\" cries Maillard, in thus addressing himself to the _ladies_: \"it\r\nis for _you_ all this damnation ensues. Yes! yes! you must have rich\r\nsatins, and girdles of gold out of this accursed money. When any one has\r\nanything to receive from the husband, he must make a present to the wife\r\nof some fine gown, or girdle, or ring. If you ladies and gentlemen who\r\nare battening on your pleasures, and wear scarlet clothes, I believe if\r\nyou were closely put in a good press, we should see the blood of the\r\npoor gush out, with which your scarlet is dyed.\"\r\n\r\nMaillard notices the following curious particulars of the mode of\r\n_cheating in trade_ in his times.\r\n\r\nHe is violent against the apothecaries for their cheats. \"They mix\r\nginger with cinnamon, which they sell for real spices: they put their\r\nbags of ginger, pepper, saffron, cinnamon, and other drugs in damp\r\ncellars, that they may weigh heavier; they mix oil with saffron, to give\r\nit a colour, and to make it weightier.\" He does not forget those\r\ntradesmen who put water in their wool, and moisten their cloth that it\r\nmay stretch; tavern-keepers, who sophisticate and mingle wines; the\r\nbutchers, who blow up their meat, and who mix hog's lard with the fat of\r\ntheir meat. He terribly declaims against those who buy with a great\r\nallowance of measure and weight, and then sell with a small measure and\r\nweight; and curses those who, when they weigh, press the scales down\r\nwith their finger. But it is time to conclude with Master Oliver! His\r\ncatalogue is, however, by no means exhausted; and it may not be amiss to\r\nobserve, that the present age has retained every one of the sins.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from Menot's sermons, which are written, like\r\nMaillard's, in a barbarous Latin, mixed with old French.\r\n\r\nMichael Menot died in 1518. I think he has more wit than Maillard, and\r\noccasionally displays a brilliant imagination; with the same singular\r\nmixture of grave declamation and farcical absurdities. He is called in\r\nthe title-page the _golden-tongued_. It runs thus, _Predicatoris qui\r\nlingua aurea, sua tempestate nuncupatus est, Sermones quadragesimales,\r\nab ipso olim Turonis declamati_. _Paris, 1525_, 8vo.\r\n\r\nWhen he compares the church with a vine, he says, \"There were once some\r\nBritons and Englishmen who would have carried away all France into their\r\ncountry, because they found our wine better than their beer; but as they\r\nwell knew that they could not always remain in France, nor carry away\r\nFrance into their country, they would at least carry with them several\r\nstocks of vines; they planted some in England; but these stocks soon\r\ndegenerated, because the soil was not adapted to them.\" Notwithstanding\r\nwhat Menot said in 1500, and that we have tried so often, we have often\r\nflattered ourselves that if we plant vineyards, we may have English\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nThe following beautiful figure describes those who live neglectful of\r\ntheir aged parents, who had cherished them into prosperity. \"See the\r\ntrees flourish and recover their leaves; it is their root that has\r\nproduced all; but when the branches are loaded with flowers and with\r\nfruits, they yield nothing to the root. This is an image of those\r\nchildren who prefer their own amusements, and to game away their\r\nfortunes, than to give to their old parents that which they want.\"\r\n\r\nHe acquaints us with the following circumstances of the immorality of\r\nthat age: \"Who has not got a mistress besides his wife? The poor wife\r\neats the fruits of bitterness, and even makes the bed for the mistress.\"\r\nOaths were not unfashionable in his day. \"Since the world has been\r\nworld, this crime was never greater. There were once pillories for these\r\nswearers; but now this crime is so common, that the child of five years\r\ncan swear; and even the old dotard of eighty, who has only two teeth\r\nremaining, can fling out an oath.\"\r\n\r\nOn the power of the fair sex of his day, he observes--\"A father says, my\r\nson studies; he must have a bishopric, or an abbey of 500 livres. Then\r\nhe will have dogs, horses, and mistresses, like others. Another says, I\r\nwill have my son placed at court, and have many honourable dignities. To\r\nsucceed well, both employ the mediation of women; unhappily the church\r\nand the law are entirely at their disposal. We have artful Dalilahs who\r\nshear us close. For twelve crowns and an ell of velvet given to a woman,\r\nyou gain the worst lawsuit, and the best living.\"\r\n\r\nIn his last sermon, Menot recapitulates the various topics he had\r\ntouched on during Lent. This extract presents a curious picture, and a\r\njust notion of the versatile talents of these preachers.\r\n\r\n\"I have told _ecclesiastics_ how they should conduct themselves; not\r\nthat they are ignorant of their duties; but I must ever repeat to girls,\r\nnot to suffer themselves to be duped by them. I have told these\r\necclesiastics that they should imitate the lark; if she has a grain she\r\ndoes not remain idle, but feels her pleasure in singing, and in singing\r\nalways is ascending towards heaven. So they should not amass; but\r\nelevate the hearts of all to God; and not do as the frogs who are crying\r\nout day and night, and think they have a fine throat, but always remain\r\nfixed in the mud.\r\n\r\n\"I have told the _men of the law_ that they should have the qualities of\r\nthe eagle. The first is, that this bird when it flies fixes its eye on\r\nthe sun; so all judges, counsellors, and attorneys, in judging, writing,\r\nand signing, should always have God before their eyes. And secondly,\r\nthis bird is never greedy; it willingly shares its prey with others; so\r\nall lawyers, who are rich in crowns after having had their bills paid,\r\nshould distribute some to the poor, particularly when they are conscious\r\nthat their money arises from their prey.\r\n\r\n\"I have spoken of the _marriage state_, but all that I have said has\r\nbeen disregarded. See those wretches who break the hymeneal chains, and\r\nabandon their wives! they pass their holidays out of their parishes,\r\nbecause if they remained at home they must have joined their wives at\r\nchurch; they liked their prostitutes better; and it will be so every day\r\nin the year! I would as well dine with a Jew or a heretic, as with them.\r\nWhat an infected place is this! Mistress Lubricity has taken possession\r\nof the whole city; look in every corner, and you'll be convinced.\r\n\r\n\"For you _married women_! If you have heard the nightingale's song, you\r\nmust know that she sings during three months, and that she is silent\r\nwhen she has young ones. So there is a time in which you may sing and\r\ntake your pleasures in the marriage state, and another to watch your\r\nchildren. Don't damn yourselves for them; and remember it would be\r\nbetter to see them drowned than damned.\r\n\r\n\"As to _widows_, I observe, that the turtle withdraws and sighs in the\r\nwoods, whenever she has lost her companion; so must they retire into the\r\nwood of the cross, and having lost their temporal husband, take no other\r\nbut Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n\"And, to close all I have told _girls_ that they must fly from the\r\ncompany of men, and not permit them to embrace, nor even touch them.\r\nLook on the rose; it has a delightful odour; it embalms the place in\r\nwhich it is placed; but if you grasp it underneath, it will prick you\r\ntill the blood issues. The beauty of the rose is the beauty of the girl.\r\nThe beauty and perfume of the first invite to smell and to handle it,\r\nbut when it is touched underneath it pricks sharply; the beauty of a\r\ngirl likewise invites the hand; but you, my young ladies, you must never\r\nsuffer this, for I tell you that every man who does this designs to make\r\nyou harlots.\"\r\n\r\nThese ample extracts may convey the same pleasure to the reader which I\r\nhave received by collecting them from their scarce originals, little\r\nknown even to the curious. Menot, it cannot be denied, displays a poetic\r\nimagination, and a fertility of conception which distinguishes him among\r\nhis rivals. The same taste and popular manner came into our country, and\r\nwere suited to the simplicity of the age. In 1527, our Bishop Latimer\r\npreached a sermon,[74] in which he expresses himself thus:--\"Now, ye\r\nhave heard what is meant by this _first card_, and how ye ought to\r\n_play_. I purpose again to _deal_ unto you another _card of the same\r\nsuit_; for they be so nigh affinity, that one cannot be well played\r\nwithout the other.\"[75] It is curious to observe about a century\r\nafterwards, as Fuller informs us, that when a country clergyman imitated\r\nthese familiar allusions, the taste of the congregation had so changed\r\nthat he was interrupted by peals of laughter!\r\n\r\nEven in more modern times have Menot and Maillard found an imitator in\r\nlittle Father André, as well as others. His character has been variously\r\ndrawn. He is by some represented as a kind of buffoon in the pulpit; but\r\nothers more judiciously observe, that he only indulged his natural\r\ngenius, and uttered humorous and lively things, as the good Father\r\nobserves himself, to keep the attention of his audience awake. He was\r\nnot always laughing. \"He told many a bold truth,\" says the author of\r\n_Guerre des Auteurs anciens et modernes_, \"that sent bishops to their\r\ndioceses, and made many a coquette blush. He possessed the art of biting\r\nwhen he smiled; and more ably combated vice by his ingenious satire than\r\nby those vague apostrophes which no one takes to himself. While others\r\nwere straining their minds to catch at sublime thoughts which no one\r\nunderstood, he lowered his talents to the most humble situations, and to\r\nthe minutest things. From them he drew his examples and his comparisons;\r\nand the one and the other never failed of success.\" Marville says, that\r\n\"his expressions were full of shrewd simplicity. He made very free use\r\nof the most popular proverbs. His comparisons and figures were always\r\nborrowed from the most familiar and lowest things.\" To ridicule\r\neffectually the reigning vices, he would prefer quirks or puns to\r\nsublime thoughts; and he was little solicitous of his choice of\r\nexpression, so the things came home. Gozzi, in Italy, had the same power\r\nin drawing unexpected inferences from vulgar and familiar occurrences.\r\nIt was by this art Whitfield obtained so many followers. In Piozzi's\r\nBritish Synonymes, vol. ii. p. 205, we have an instance of Gozzi's\r\nmanner. In the time of Charles II. it became fashionable to introduce\r\nhumour into sermons. Sterne seems to have revived it in his: South's\r\nsparkle perpetually with wit and pun.\r\n\r\nFar different, however, are the characters of the sublime preachers, of\r\nwhom the French have preserved the following descriptions.\r\n\r\nWe have not any more Bourdaloue, La Rue, and Massillon; but the idea\r\nwhich still exists of their manner of addressing their auditors may\r\nserve instead of lessons. Each had his own peculiar mode, always adapted\r\nto place, time, circumstance; to their auditors, their style, and their\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBourdaloue, with a collected air, had little action; with eyes generally\r\nhalf closed he penetrated the hearts of the people by the sound of a\r\nvoice uniform and solemn. The tone with which a sacred orator pronounced\r\nthe words, _Tu est ille vir!_ \"Thou art the man!\" in suddenly addressing\r\nthem to one of the kings of France, struck more forcibly than their\r\napplication. Madame de Sévigné describes our preacher, by saying,\r\n\"Father Bourdaloue thunders at Notre Dame.\"\r\n\r\nLa Rue appeared with the air of a prophet. His manner was irresistible,\r\nfull of fire, intelligence, and force. He had strokes perfectly\r\noriginal. Several old men, his contemporaries, still shuddered at the\r\nrecollection of the expression which he employed in an apostrophe to the\r\nGod of vengeance, _Evaginare gladium tuum!_\r\n\r\nThe person of Massillon affected his admirers. He was seen in the pulpit\r\nwith that air of simplicity, that modest demeanour, those eyes humbly\r\ndeclining, those unstudied gestures, that passionate tone, that mild\r\ncountenance of a man penetrated with his subject, conveying to the mind\r\nthe most luminous ideas, and to the heart the most tender emotions.\r\nBaron, the tragedian, coming out from one of his sermons, truth forced\r\nfrom his lips a confession humiliating to his profession; \"My friend,\"\r\nsaid he to one of his companions, \"this is an _orator!_ and we are _only\r\nactors!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: In it he likens Christianity to a game at cards.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: In his \"Sermon of the Plough,\" preached at Paul's Cross,\r\n1548, we meet the same quaint imagery. \"Preaching of the Gospel is one\r\nof God's plough works, and the preacher is one of God's ploughmen--and\r\nwell may the preacher and the ploughman be likened together: first, for\r\ntheir labour at all seasons of the year; for there is no time of the\r\nyear in which the ploughman hath not some special work to do.\" He says\r\nthat Satan \"is ever busy in following his plough;\" and he winds up his\r\nperoration by the somewhat startling words, \"the devil shall go for my\r\nmoney, for he applieth to his business. Therefore, ye unpreaching\r\nprelates, learn of the devil: to be diligent in doing your office learn\r\nof the devil: and if you will not learn of God, nor good men, for shame\r\nlearn of the devil.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASTERLY IMITATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been found occasionally some artists who could so perfectly\r\nimitate the spirit, the taste, the character, and the peculiarities of\r\ngreat masters, that they have not unfrequently deceived the most skilful\r\nconnoisseurs. Michael Angelo sculptured a sleeping Cupid, of which\r\nhaving broken off an arm, he buried the statue in a place where he knew\r\nit would soon be found. The critics were never tired of admiring it, as\r\none of the most precious relics of antiquity. It was sold to the\r\nCardinal of St. George, to whom Michael Angelo discovered the whole\r\nmystery, by joining to the Cupid the arm which he had reserved.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote of Peter Mignard is more singular. This great artist painted\r\na Magdalen on a canvas fabricated at Rome. A broker, in concert with\r\nMignard, went to the Chevalier de Clairville, and told him as a secret\r\nthat he was to receive from Italy a Magdalen of Guido, and his\r\nmasterpiece. The chevalier caught the bait, begged the preference, and\r\npurchased the picture at a very high price.\r\n\r\nHe was informed that he had been imposed upon, and that the Magdalen was\r\npainted by Mignard. Mignard himself caused the alarm to be given, but\r\nthe amateur would not believe it; all the connoisseurs agreed it was a\r\nGuido, and the famous Le Brun corroborated this opinion.\r\n\r\nThe chevalier came to Mignard:--\"Some persons assure me that my Magdalen\r\nis your work!\"--\"Mine! they do me great honour. I am sure that Le Brun\r\nis not of this opinion.\" \"Le Brun swears it can be no other than a\r\nGuido. You shall dine with me, and meet several of the first\r\nconnoisseurs.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day of meeting, the picture was again more closely inspected.\r\nMignard hinted his doubts whether the piece was the work of that great\r\nmaster; he insinuated that it was possible to be deceived; and added,\r\nthat if it was Guido's, he did not think it in his best manner. \"It is a\r\nGuido, sir, and in his very best manner,\" replied Le Brun, with warmth;\r\nand all the critics were unanimous. Mignard then spoke in a firm tone of\r\nvoice: \"And I, gentlemen, will wager three hundred louis that it is not\r\na Guido.\" The dispute now became violent: Le Brun was desirous of\r\naccepting the wager. In a word, the affair became such that it could add\r\nnothing more to the glory of Mignard. \"No, sir,\" replied the latter, \"I\r\nam too honest to bet when I am certain to win. Monsieur le Chevalier,\r\nthis piece cost you two thousand crowns: the money must be\r\nreturned,--the painting is _mine_.\" Le Brun would not believe it. \"The\r\nproof,\" Mignard continued, \"is easy. On this canvas, which is a Roman\r\none, was the portrait of a cardinal; I will show you his cap.\"--The\r\nchevalier did not know which of the rival artists to credit. The\r\nproposition alarmed him. \"He who painted the picture shall repair it,\"\r\nsaid Mignard. He took a pencil dipped in oil, and rubbing the hair of\r\nthe Magdalen, discovered the cap of the cardinal. The honour of the\r\ningenious painter could no longer be disputed; Le Brun, vexed,\r\nsarcastically exclaimed, \"Always paint Guido, but never Mignard.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a collection of engravings by that ingenious artist Bernard\r\nPicart, which has been published under the title of _The Innocent\r\nImpostors_. Picart had long been vexed at the taste of his day, which\r\nran wholly in favour of antiquity, and no one would look at, much less\r\nadmire, a modern master. He published a pretended collection, or a set\r\nof prints, from the designs of the great painters; in which he imitated\r\nthe etchings and engravings of the various masters, and much were these\r\nprints admired as the works of Guido, Rembrandt, and others. Having had\r\nhis joke, they were published under the title of _Imposteurs\r\nInnocentes_. The connoisseurs, however, are strangely divided in their\r\nopinion of the merit of this collection. Gilpin classes these \"Innocent\r\nImpostors\" among the most entertaining of his works, and is delighted by\r\nthe happiness with which he has outdone in their own excellences the\r\nartists whom he copied; but Strutt, too grave to admit of jokes that\r\ntwitch the connoisseurs, declares that they could never have deceived an\r\nexperienced judge, and reprobates such kinds of ingenuity, played off at\r\nthe cost of the venerable brotherhood of the cognoscenti.\r\n\r\nThe same thing was, however, done by Goltzius, who being disgusted at\r\nthe preference given to the works of Albert Durer, Lucas of Leyden, and\r\nothers of that school, and having attempted to introduce a better taste,\r\nwhich was not immediately relished, he published what were afterwards\r\ncalled his _masterpieces_. These are six prints in the style of these\r\nmasters, merely to prove that Goltzius could imitate their works, if he\r\nthought proper. One of these, the Circumcision, he had printed on soiled\r\npaper; and to give it the brown tint of antiquity had carefully smoked\r\nit, by which means it was sold as a curious performance, and deceived\r\nsome of the most capital connoisseurs of the day, one of whom bought it\r\nas one of the finest engravings of Albert Durer: even Strutt\r\nacknowledges the merit of Goltzius's _masterpieces_!\r\n\r\nTo these instances of artists I will add others of celebrated authors.\r\nMuretus rendered Joseph Scaliger, a great stickler for the ancients,\r\nhighly ridiculous by an artifice which he practised. He sent some verses\r\nwhich he pretended were copied from an old manuscript. The verses were\r\nexcellent, and Scaliger was credulous. After having read them, he\r\nexclaimed they were admirable, and affirmed that they were written by an\r\nold comic poet, Trabeus. He quoted them, in his commentary on Varro _De\r\nRe Rusticâ_, as one of the most precious fragments of antiquity. It was\r\nthen, when he had fixed his foot firmly in the trap, that Muretus\r\ninformed the world of the little dependence to be placed on the critical\r\nsagacity of one so prejudiced in favour of the ancients, and who\r\nconsidered his judgment as infallible.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Regnier Desmarais, having written an ode or, as the Italians\r\ncall it, canzone, sent it to the Abbé Strozzi at Florence, who used it\r\nto impose on three or four academicians of Della Crusca. He gave out\r\nthat Leo Allatius, librarian of the Vatican, in examining carefully the\r\nMSS. of Petrarch preserved there, had found two pages slightly glued,\r\nwhich having separated, he had discovered this ode. The fact was not at\r\nfirst easily credited; but afterwards the similarity of style and manner\r\nrendered it highly probable. When Strozzi undeceived the public, it\r\nprocured the Abbé Regnier a place in the academy, as an honourable\r\ntestimony of his ingenuity.\r\n\r\nPère Commire, when Louis XIV. resolved on the conquest of Holland,\r\ncomposed a Latin fable, entitled \"The Sun and the Frogs,\" in which he\r\nassumed with such felicity the style and character of Phædrus, that the\r\nlearned Wolfius was deceived, and innocently inserted it in his edition\r\nof that fabulist.\r\n\r\nFlaminius Strada would have deceived most of the critics of his age, if\r\nhe had given as the remains of antiquity the different pieces of history\r\nand poetry which he composed on the model of the ancients, in his\r\n_Prolusiones Academicæ_. To preserve probability he might have given out\r\nthat he had drawn them, from some old and neglected library; he had then\r\nonly to have added a good commentary, tending to display the conformity\r\nof the style and manner of these fragments with the works of those\r\nauthors to whom he ascribed them.\r\n\r\nSigonius was a great master of the style of Cicero, and ventured to\r\npublish a treatise _De Consolatione_, as a composition of Cicero\r\nrecently discovered; many were deceived by the counterfeit, which was\r\nperformed with great dexterity, and was long received as genuine; but he\r\ncould not deceive Lipsius, who, after reading only ten lines, threw it\r\naway, exclaiming, \"_Vah! non est Ciceronis_.\" The late Mr. Burke\r\nsucceeded more skilfully in his \"Vindication of Natural Society,\" which\r\nfor a long time passed as the composition of Lord Bolingbroke; so\r\nperfect is this ingenious imposture of the spirit, manner, and course of\r\nthinking of the noble author. I believe it was written for a wager, and\r\nfairly won.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Edward the Fourth was dissipated and voluptuous; and probably owed\r\nhis crown to his handsomeness, his enormous debts, and passion for the\r\nfair sex. He had many Jane Shores. Honest Philip de Comines, his\r\ncontemporary, says, \"That what greatly contributed to his entering\r\nLondon as soon as he appeared at its gates was the great debts this\r\nprince had contracted, which made his creditors gladly assist him; and\r\nthe high favour in which he was held by the _bourgeoises_, into whose\r\ngood graces he had frequently glided, and who gained over to him their\r\nhusbands, who, for the tranquillity of their lives, were glad to depose\r\nor to raise monarchs. Many ladies and rich citizens' wives, of whom\r\nformerly he had great privacies and familiar acquaintance, gained over\r\nto him their husbands and relations.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the description of his voluptuous life; we must recollect that\r\nthe writer had been an eye-witness, and was an honest man.\r\n\r\n\"He had been during the last twelve years more accustomed to his ease\r\nand pleasure than any other prince who lived in his time. He had nothing\r\nin his thoughts but _les dames_, and of them more than was _reasonable_;\r\nand hunting-matches, good eating, and great care of his person. When he\r\nwent in their seasons to these hunting-matches, he always had carried\r\nwith him great pavilions for _les dames_, and at the same time gave\r\nsplendid entertainments; so that it is not surprising that his person\r\nwas as jolly as any one I ever saw. He was then young, and as handsome\r\nas any man of his age; but he has since become enormously fat.\"\r\n\r\nSince I have got old Philip in my hand, the reader will not, perhaps, be\r\ndispleased, if he attends to a little more of his _naïveté_, which will\r\nappear in the form of a _conversazione_ of the times. He relates what\r\npassed between the English and the French Monarch.\r\n\r\n\"When the ceremony of the oath was concluded, our king, who was desirous\r\nof being friendly, began to say to the king of England, in a laughing\r\nway, that he must come to Paris, and be jovial amongst our ladies; and\r\nthat he would give him the Cardinal de Bourbon for his confessor, who\r\nwould very willingly absolve him of any _sin_ which perchance he might\r\ncommit. The king of England seemed well pleased at the invitation, and\r\nlaughed heartily; for he knew that the said cardinal was _un fort bon\r\ncompagnon_. When the king was returning, he spoke on the road to me; and\r\nsaid that he did not like to find the king of England so much inclined\r\nto come to Paris. 'He is,' said he, 'a very _handsome_ king; he likes\r\nthe women too much. He may probably find one at Paris that may make him\r\nlike to come too often, or stay too long. His predecessors have already\r\nbeen too much at Paris and in Normandy;' and that 'his company was not\r\nagreeable _this side of the sea_; but that, beyond the sea, he wished\r\nto be _bon frère et amy_.'\"\r\n\r\nI have called Philip de Comines _honest_. The old writers, from the\r\nsimplicity of their style, usually receive this honourable epithet; but\r\nsometimes they deserve it as little as most modern memoir writers. No\r\nenemy is indeed so terrible as a man of genius. Comines's violent enmity\r\nto the Duke of Burgundy, which appears in these memoirs, has been traced\r\nby the minute researchers of anecdotes; and the cause is not honourable\r\nto the memoir-writer, whose resentment was implacable. De Comines was\r\nborn a subject of the Duke of Burgundy, and for seven years had been a\r\nfavourite; but one day returning from hunting with the Duke, then Count\r\nde Charolois, in familiar jocularity he sat himself down before the\r\nprince, ordering the prince to pull off his boots. The count laughed,\r\nand did this; but in return for Comines's princely amusement, dashed the\r\nboot in his face, and gave Comines a bloody nose, From that time he was\r\nmortified in the court of Burgundy by the nickname of the _booted head_.\r\nComines long felt a rankling wound in his mind; and after this domestic\r\nquarrel, for it was nothing more, he went over to the king of France,\r\nand wrote off his bile against the Duke of Burgundy in these \"Memoirs,\"\r\nwhich give posterity a caricature likeness of that prince, whom he is\r\never censuring for presumption, obstinacy, pride, and cruelty. This Duke\r\nof Burgundy, however, it is said, with many virtues, had but one great\r\nvice, the vice of sovereigns, that of ambition!\r\n\r\nThe impertinence of Comines had not been chastised with great severity;\r\nbut the nickname was never forgiven: unfortunately for the duke, Comines\r\nwas a man of genius. When we are versed in the history of the times, we\r\noften discover that memoir-writers have some secret poison in their\r\nhearts. Many, like Comines, have had the boot dashed on their nose.\r\nPersonal rancour wonderfully enlivens the style of Lord Orford and\r\nCardinal de Retz. Memoirs are often dictated by its fiercest spirit; and\r\nthen histories are composed from memoirs. Where is TRUTH? Not always in\r\nhistories and memoirs!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis great queen passionately admired handsome persons, and he was\r\nalready far advanced in her favour who approached her with beauty and\r\ngrace. She had so unconquerable an aversion for men who had been treated\r\nunfortunately by nature, that she could not endure their presence.\r\n\r\nWhen she issued from her palace, her guards were careful to disperse\r\nfrom before her eyes hideous and deformed people, the lame, the\r\nhunchbacked, &c.; in a word, all those whose appearance might shock her\r\nfastidious sensations.\r\n\r\n\"There is this singular and admirable in the conduct of Elizabeth that\r\nshe made her pleasures subservient to her policy, and she maintained her\r\naffairs by what in general occasions the ruin of princes. So secret were\r\nher amours, that even to the present day their mysteries cannot be\r\npenetrated; but the utility she drew from them is public, and always\r\noperated for the good of her people. Her lovers were her ministers, and\r\nher ministers were her lovers. Love commanded, love was obeyed; and the\r\nreign of this princess was happy, because it was the reign of _Love_, in\r\nwhich its chains and its slavery are liked!\"\r\n\r\nThe origin of Raleigh's advancement in the queen's graces was by an act\r\nof gallantry. Raleigh spoiled a new plush cloak, while the queen,\r\nstepping cautiously on this prodigal's footcloth, shot forth a smile, in\r\nwhich he read promotion. Captain Raleigh soon became Sir Walter, and\r\nrapidly advanced in the queen's favour.\r\n\r\nHume has furnished us with ample proofs of the _passion_ which her\r\ncourtiers feigned for her, and it remains a question whether it ever\r\nwent further than boisterous or romantic gallantry. The secrecy of her\r\namours is not so wonderful as it seems, if there were impediments to any\r\nbut exterior gallantries. Hume has preserved in his notes a letter\r\nwritten by Raleigh. It is a perfect amorous composition. After having\r\nexerted his poetic talents to exalt _her charms_ and _his affection_, he\r\nconcludes, by comparing her majesty, who was then _sixty_, to Venus and\r\nDiana. Sir Walter was not her only courtier who wrote in this style.\r\nEven in her old age she affected a strange fondness for music and\r\ndancing, with a kind of childish simplicity; her court seemed a court of\r\nlove, and she the sovereign. Secretary Cecil, the youngest son of Lord\r\nBurleigh, seems to have perfectly entered into her character. Lady Derby\r\nwore about her neck and in her bosom a portrait; the queen inquired\r\nabout it, but her ladyship was anxious to conceal it. The queen insisted\r\non having it; and discovering it to be the portrait of young Cecil, she\r\nsnatched it away, tying it upon her shoe, and walked with it; afterwards\r\nshe pinned it on her elbow, and wore it some time there. Secretary Cecil\r\nhearing of this, composed some verses and got them set to music; this\r\nmusic the queen insisted on hearing. In his verses Cecil said that he\r\nrepined not, though her majesty was pleased to grace others; he\r\ncontented himself with the favour she had given him by wearing his\r\nportrait on her feet and on her arms! The writer of the letter who\r\nrelates this anecdote, adds, \"All these things are very secret.\" In this\r\nmanner she contrived to lay the fastest hold on her able servants, and\r\nher servants on her.\r\n\r\nThose who are intimately acquainted with the private anecdotes of those\r\ntimes, know what encouragement this royal coquette gave to most who were\r\nnear her person. Dodd, in his Church History, says, that the Earls of\r\nArran and Arundel, and Sir William Pickering, \"were not out of hopes of\r\ngaining Queen Elizabeth's affections in a matrimonial way.\"\r\n\r\nShe encouraged every person of eminence: she even went so far, on the\r\nanniversary of her coronation, as publicly to take a ring from her\r\nfinger, and put it on the Duke of Aleçnon's hand. She also ranked\r\namongst her suitors Henry the Third of France, and Henry the Great.\r\n\r\nShe never forgave Buzenval for ridiculing her bad pronunciation of the\r\nFrench language; and when Henry IV. sent him over on an embassy, she\r\nwould not receive him. So nice was the irritable pride of this great\r\nqueen, that she made her private injuries matters of state.\r\n\r\n\"This queen,\" writes Du Maurier, in his _Memoires pour servir à\r\nl'Histoire de la Hollande_, \"who displayed so many heroic\r\naccomplishments, had this foible, of wishing to be thought beautiful by\r\nall the world. I heard from my father, that at every audience he had\r\nwith her majesty, she pulled off her gloves more than a hundred times to\r\ndisplay her hands, which indeed were very beautiful and very white.\"\r\n\r\nA not less curious anecdote relates to the affair of the Duke of Anjou\r\nand our Elizabeth; it is one more proof of her partiality for handsome\r\nmen. The writer was Lewis Guyon, a contemporary.\r\n\r\n\"Francis Duke of Anjou, being desirous of marrying a crowned head,\r\ncaused proposals of marriage to be made to Elizabeth, queen of England.\r\nLetters passed betwixt them, and their portraits were exchanged. At\r\nlength her majesty informed him, that she would never contract a\r\nmarriage with any one who sought her, if she did not first _see his\r\nperson_. If he would not come, nothing more should be said on the\r\nsubject. This prince, over-pressed by his young friends (who were as\r\nlittle able of judging as himself), paid no attention to the counsels of\r\nmen of maturer judgment. He passed over to England without a splendid\r\ntrain. The said lady contemplated his _person_: she found him _ugly_,\r\ndisfigured by deep sears of the _small-pox_, and that he also had an\r\n_ill-shaped nose_, with _swellings in the neck_! All these were so many\r\nreasons with her, that he could never be admitted into her good graces.\"\r\n\r\nPuttenham, in his very rare book of the \"Art of Poesie,\" p. 248, notices\r\nthe grace and majesty of Elizabeth's demeanour: \"Her stately manner of\r\nwalk, with a certaine granditie rather than gravietie, marching with\r\nleysure, which our sovereign ladye and mistresse is accustomed to doe\r\ngenerally, unless it be when she walketh apace for her pleasure, or to\r\ncatch her a heate in the cold mornings.\"\r\n\r\nBy the following extract from a letter from one of her gentlemen, we\r\ndiscover that her usual habits, though studious, were not of the\r\ngentlest kind, and that the service she exacted from her attendants was\r\nnot borne without concealed murmurs. The writer groans in secrecy to his\r\nfriend. Sir John Stanhope writes to Sir Robert Cecil in 1598: \"I was all\r\nthe afternowne with her majestie, _at my booke_; and then thinking to\r\nrest me, went in agayne with your letter. She was pleased with the\r\nFilosofer's stone, and hath ben _all this daye reasonably quyett_. Mr.\r\nGrevell is absent, and I am tyed so as I cannot styrr, but shall be _at\r\nthe wourse_ for yt, these two dayes!\"[76]\r\n\r\nPuttenham, p. 249, has also recorded an honourable anecdote of\r\nElizabeth, and characteristic of that high majesty which was in her\r\nthoughts, as well as in her actions. When she came to the crown, a\r\nknight of the realm, who had insolently behaved to her when Lady\r\nElizabeth, fell upon his knees and besought her pardon, expecting to be\r\nsent to the Tower: she replied mildly, \"Do you not know that we are\r\ndescended of the _lion_, whose nature is not to harme or prey upon the\r\nmouse, or any other such small vermin?\"\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth was taught to write by the celebrated _Roger Ascham_.\r\nHer writing is extremely beautiful and correct, as may be seen by\r\nexamining a little manuscript book of prayers, preserved in the British\r\nMuseum. I have seen her first writing book, preserved at Oxford in the\r\nBodleian Library: the gradual improvement in her majesty's handwriting\r\nis very honourable to her diligence; but the most curious thing is the\r\npaper on which she tried her pens; this she usually did by writing the\r\nname of her beloved brother Edward; a proof of the early and ardent\r\nattachment she formed to that amiable prince.\r\n\r\nThe education of Elizabeth had been severely classical; she thought and\r\nshe wrote in all the spirit of the characters of antiquity; and her\r\nspeeches and her letters are studded with apophthegms, and a terseness\r\nof ideas and language, that give an exalted idea of her mind. In her\r\nevasive answers to the Commons, in reply to their petitions to her\r\nmajesty to marry, she has employed an energetic word: \"Were I to tell\r\nyou that I do not mean to marry, I might say less than I did intend; and\r\nwere I to tell you that I do mean to marry, I might say more than it is\r\nproper for you to know; therefore I give you an _answer_, ANSWERLESS!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Sir Robert Cecil, in a letter to Sir John Harrington,\r\nhappily characterized her Majesty as occasionally \"being more than a\r\nman, and, in truth, sometimes less than a woman.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese language is like no other on the globe; it is said to\r\ncontain not more than about three hundred and thirty words, but it is by\r\nno means monotonous, for it has four accents; the even, the raised, the\r\nlessened, and the returning, which multiply every word into four; as\r\ndifficult, says Mr. Astle, for an European to understand, as it is for a\r\nChinese to comprehend the six pronunciations of the French E. In fact,\r\nthey can so diversify their monosyllabic words by the different _tones_\r\nwhich they give them, that the same character differently accented\r\nsignifies sometimes ten or more different things.\r\n\r\nP. Bourgeois, one of the missionaries, attempted, after ten months'\r\nresidence at Pekin, to preach in the Chinese language. These are the\r\nwords of the good father: \"God knows how much this first Chinese sermon\r\ncost me! I can assure you this language resembles no other. The same\r\nword has never but one termination; and then adieu to all that in our\r\ndeclensions distinguishes the gender, and the number of things we would\r\nspeak: adieu, in the verbs, to all which might explain the active\r\nperson, how and in what time it acts, if it acts alone or with others:\r\nin a word, with the Chinese, the same word is substantive, adjective,\r\nverb, singular, plural, masculine, feminine, &c. It is the person who\r\nhears who must arrange the circumstances, and guess them. Add to all\r\nthis, that all the words of this language are reduced to three hundred\r\nand a few more; that they are pronounced in so many different ways, that\r\nthey signify eighty thousand different things, which are expressed by as\r\nmany different characters. This is not all: the arrangement of all these\r\nmonosyllables appears to be under no general rule; so that to know the\r\nlanguage after having learnt the words, we must learn every particular\r\nphrase: the least inversion would make you unintelligible to three parts\r\nof the Chinese.\r\n\r\n\"I will give you an example of their words. They told me _chou_\r\nsignifies a _book_: so that I thought whenever the word _chou_ was\r\npronounced, a _book_ was the subject. Not at all! _Chou_, the next time\r\nI heard it, I found signified a _tree_. Now I was to recollect; _chou_\r\nwas a _book_ or a _tree_. But this amounted to nothing; _chou_, I found,\r\nexpressed also _great heats_; _chou_ is to _relate_; _chou_ is the\r\n_Aurora_; _chou_ means to be _accustomed_; _chou_ expresses the _loss of\r\na wager_, &c. I should not finish, were I to attempt to give you all its\r\nsignifications.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding these singular difficulties, could one but find a help\r\nin the perusal of their books, I should not complain. But this is\r\nimpossible! Their language is quite different from that of simple\r\nconversation. What will ever be an insurmountable difficulty to every\r\nEuropean is the pronunciation; every word may be pronounced in five\r\ndifferent tones, yet every tone is not so distinct that an unpractised\r\near can easily distinguish it. These monosyllables fly with amazing\r\nrapidity; then they are continually disguised by elisions, which\r\nsometimes hardly leave anything of two monosyllables. From an aspirated\r\ntone you must pass immediately to an even one; from a whistling note to\r\nan inward one: sometimes your voice must proceed from the palate;\r\nsometimes it must be guttural, and almost always nasal. I recited my\r\nsermon at least fifty times to my servant before I spoke it in public;\r\nand yet I am told, though he continually corrected me, that of the ten\r\nparts of the sermon (as the Chinese express themselves), they hardly\r\nunderstood three. Fortunately the Chinese are wonderfully patient; and\r\nthey are astonished that any ignorant stranger should be able to learn\r\ntwo words of their language.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said that \"Satires are often composed in China, which, if\r\nyou attend to the _characters_, their import is pure and sublime; but if\r\nyou regard the _tone_ only, they contain a meaning ludicrous or obscene.\r\nIn the Chinese _one word_ sometimes corresponds to three or four\r\nthousand characters; a property quite opposite to that of our language,\r\nin which _myriads_ of different _words_ are expressed by the _same\r\nletters_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Philosophical Magazine for May, 1806, we find that \"several of\r\nthe medical literati on the continent are at present engaged in making\r\ninquiries and experiments upon the _influence of music in the cure of\r\ndiseases_.\" The learned Dusaux is said to lead the band of this new\r\ntribe of _amateurs_ and _cognoscenti_.\r\n\r\nThe subject excited my curiosity, though I since have found that it is\r\nno new discovery.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious article in Dr. Burney's History of Music, \"On the\r\nMedicinal Powers attributed to Music by the Ancients,\" which he derived\r\nfrom the learned labours of a modern physician, M. Burette, who\r\ndoubtless could play a tune to, as well as prescribe one to, his\r\npatient. He conceives that music can relieve the pains of the sciatica;\r\nand that, independent of the greater or less skill of the musician, by\r\nflattering the ear, and diverting the attention, and occasioning certain\r\nvibrations of the nerves, it can remove those obstructions which\r\noccasion this disorder. M. Burette, and many modern physicians and\r\nphilosophers, have believed that music has the power of affecting the\r\nmind, and the whole nervous system, so as to give a temporary relief in\r\ncertain diseases, and even a radical cure. De Mairan, Bianchini, and\r\nother respectable names, have pursued the same career. But the ancients\r\nrecorded miracles!\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Mitchell, of Brighthelmstone, wrote a dissertation, \"_De\r\nArte Medendi apud Priscos, Musices ope atque Carminum_,\" printed for J.\r\nNichols, 1783. He writes under the assumed name of Michael Gaspar; but\r\nwhether this learned dissertator be grave or jocular, more than one\r\ncritic has not been able to resolve me. I suspect it to be a satire on\r\nthe parade of Germanic erudition, by which they often prove a point by\r\nthe weakest analogies and most fanciful conceits.\r\n\r\nAmongst half-civilized nations, diseases have been generally attributed\r\nto the influence of evil spirits. The depression of mind which is\r\ngenerally attendant on sickness, and the delirium accompanying certain\r\nstages of disease, seem to have been considered as especially denoting\r\nthe immediate influence of a demon. The effect of music in raising the\r\nenergies of the mind, or what we commonly call animal spirits, was\r\nobvious to early observation. Its power of attracting strong attention\r\nmay in some cases have appeared to affect even those who laboured under\r\na considerable degree of mental disorder. The accompanying depression of\r\nmind was considered as a part of the disease, perhaps rightly enough,\r\nand music was prescribed as a remedy to remove the symptom, when\r\nexperience had not ascertained the probable cause. Homer, whose heroes\r\nexhibit high passions, but not refined manners, represents the Grecian\r\narmy as employing music to stay the raging of the plague. The Jewish\r\nnation, in the time of King David, appear not to have been much further\r\nadvanced in civilization; accordingly we find David employed in his\r\nyouth to remove the mental derangement of Saul by his harp. The method\r\nof cure was suggested as a common one in those days, by Saul's servants;\r\nand the success is not mentioned as a miracle. Pindar, with poetic\r\nlicence, speaks of Æsculapius healing acute disorders with soothing\r\nsongs; but Æsculapius, whether man or deity, or between both, is a\r\nphysician of the days of barbarism and fable. Pliny scouts the idea that\r\nmusic could affect real bodily injury, but quotes Homer on the subject;\r\nmentions Theophrastus as suggesting a tune for the cure of the hip gout,\r\nand Cato as entertaining a fancy that it had a good effect when limbs\r\nwere out of joint, and likewise that Varro thought it good for the gout.\r\nAulus Gellius cites a work of Theophrastus, which recommends music as a\r\nspecific for the bite of a viper. Boyle and Shakspeare mention the\r\neffects of music _super vesicam_. Kircher's \"Musurgia,\" and Swinburne's\r\nTravels, relate the effects of music on those who are bitten by the\r\ntarantula. Sir W. Temple seems to have given credit to the stories of\r\nthe power of music over diseases.\r\n\r\nThe ancients, indeed, record miracles in the tales they relate of the\r\nmedicinal powers of music. A fever is removed by a song, and deafness is\r\ncured by a trumpet, and the pestilence is chased away by the sweetness\r\nof an harmonious lyre. That deaf people can hear best in a great noise,\r\nis a fact alleged by some moderns, in favour of the ancient story of\r\ncuring deafness by a trumpet. Dr. Willis tells us, says Dr. Burney, of a\r\nlady who could _hear_ only while _a drum was beating_, insomuch, that\r\nher husband, the account says, hired a drummer as her servant, in order\r\nto enjoy the pleasure of her conversation.\r\n\r\nMusic and the sounds of instruments, says the lively Vigneul de\r\nMarville, contribute to the health of the body and the mind; they\r\nquicken the circulation of the blood, they dissipate vapours, and open\r\nthe vessels, so that the action of perspiration is freer. He tells a\r\nstory of a person of distinction, who assured him, that once being\r\nsuddenly seized by violent illness, instead of a consultation of\r\nphysicians, he immediately called a band of musicians; and their\r\nviolins-played so well in his inside, that his bowels became perfectly\r\nin tune, and in a few hours were harmoniously becalmed. I once heard a\r\nstory of Farinelli, the famous singer, who was sent for to Madrid, to\r\ntry the effect of his magical voice on the king of Spain. His majesty\r\nwas buried in the profoundest melancholy; nothing could raise an emotion\r\nin him; he lived in a total oblivion of life; he sate in a darkened\r\nchamber, entirely given up to the most distressing kind of madness. The\r\nphysicians ordered Farinelli at first to sing in an outer room; and for\r\nthe first day or two this was done, without any effect, on the royal\r\npatient. At length, it was observed, that the king, awakening from his\r\nstupor, seemed to listen; on the next day tears were seen starting in\r\nhis eyes; the day after he ordered the door of his chamber to be left\r\nopen--and at length the perturbed spirit entirely left our modern Saul,\r\nand the _medicinal voice_ of Farinelli effected what no other medicine\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nI now prepare to give the reader some _facts_, which he may consider as\r\na trial of credulity.--Their authorities are, however, not\r\ncontemptible.--Naturalists assert that animals and birds, as well as\r\n\"knotted oaks,\" as Congreve informs us, are sensible to the charms of\r\nmusic. This may serve as an instance:--An officer was confined in the\r\nBastile; he begged the governor to permit him the use of his lute, to\r\nsoften, by the harmonies of his instrument, the rigours of his prison.\r\nAt the end of a few days, this modern Orpheus, playing on his lute, was\r\ngreatly astonished to see frisking out of their holes great numbers of\r\nmice, and descending from their woven habitations crowds of spiders, who\r\nformed a circle about him, while he continued breathing his\r\nsoul-subduing instrument. He was petrified with astonishment. Having\r\nceased to play, the assembly, who did not come to see his person, but to\r\nhear his instrument, immediately broke up. As he had a great dislike to\r\nspiders, it was two days before he ventured again to touch his\r\ninstrument. At length, having overcome, for the novelty of his company,\r\nhis dislike of them, he recommenced his concert, when the assembly was\r\nby far more numerous than at first; and in the course of farther time,\r\nhe found himself surrounded by a hundred _musical amateurs_. Having thus\r\nsucceeded in attracting this company, he treacherously contrived to get\r\nrid of them at his will. For this purpose he begged the keeper to give\r\nhim a cat, which he put in a cage, and let loose at the very instant\r\nwhen the little hairy people were most entranced by the Orphean skill he\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Olivet has described an amusement of Pelisson during his\r\nconfinement in the Bastile, which consisted in feeding a spider, which\r\nhe had discovered forming its web in the corner of a small window. For\r\nsome time he placed his flies at the edge, while his valet, who was with\r\nhim, played on a bagpipe: little by little, the spider used itself to\r\ndistinguish the sound of the instrument, and issued from its hole to run\r\nand catch its prey. Thus calling it always by the same sound, and\r\nplacing the flies at a still greater distance, he succeeded, after\r\nseveral months, to drill the spider by regular exercise, so that at\r\nlength it never failed appearing at the first sound to seize on the fly\r\nprovided for it, even on the knees of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nMarville has given us the following curious anecdote on this subject. He\r\nsays, that doubting the truth of those who say that the love of music\r\nis a natural taste, especially the sound of instruments, and that beasts\r\nthemselves are touched by it, being one day in the country I tried an\r\nexperiment. While a man was playing on the trump marine, I made my\r\nobservations on a cat, a dog, a horse, an ass, a hind, cows, small\r\nbirds, and a cock and hens, who were in a yard, under a window on which\r\nI was leaning. I did not perceive that the cat was the least affected,\r\nand I even judged, by her air, that she would have given all the\r\ninstruments in the world for a mouse, sleeping in the sun all the time;\r\nthe horse stopped short from time to time before the window, raising his\r\nhead up now and then, as he was feeding on the grass; the dog continued\r\nfor above an hour seated on his hind legs, looking steadfastly at the\r\nplayer; the ass did not discover the least indication of his being\r\ntouched, eating his thistles peaceably; the hind lifted up her large\r\nwide ears, and seemed very attentive; the cows slept a little, and after\r\ngazing, as though they had been acquainted with us, went forward; some\r\nlittle birds who were in an aviary, and others on the trees and bushes,\r\nalmost tore their little throats with singing; but the cock, who minded\r\nonly his hens, and the hens, who were solely employed in scraping a\r\nneighbouring dunghill, did not show in any manner that they took the\r\nleast pleasure in hearing the trump marine.\r\n\r\nA modern traveller assures us, that he has repeatedly observed in the\r\nisland of Madeira, that the lizards are attracted by the notes of music,\r\nand that he has assembled a number of them by the powers of his\r\ninstrument. When the negroes catch them for food, they accompany the\r\nchase by whistling some tune, which has always the effect of drawing\r\ngreat numbers towards them. Stedman, in his Expedition to Surinam,\r\ndescribes certain sibyls among the negroes, who, among several singular\r\npractices, can charm or conjure down from the tree certain serpents, who\r\nwill wreath about the arms, neck, and breast of the pretended sorceress,\r\nlistening to her voice. The sacred writers speak of the charming of\r\nadders and serpents; and nothing, says he, is more notorious than that\r\nthe eastern Indians will rid the houses of the most venomous snakes, by\r\ncharming them with the sound of a flute, which calls them out of their\r\nholes. These anecdotes seem fully confirmed by Sir William Jones, in his\r\ndissertation on the musical modes of the Hindus.\r\n\r\n\"After food, when the operations of digestion and absorption give so\r\nmuch employment to the vessels, that a temporary state of mental repose\r\nmust be found, especially in hot climates, essential to health, it seems\r\nreasonable to believe that a few agreeable airs, either heard or played\r\nwithout effort, must have all the good effects of sleep, and none of its\r\ndisadvantages; _putting the soul in tune_, as Milton says, for any\r\nsubsequent exertion; an experiment often successfully made by myself. I\r\nhave been assured by a credible eye-witness, that two wild antelopes\r\nused often to come from their woods to the place where a more savage\r\nbeast, Sirájuddaulah, entertained himself with concerts, and that they\r\nlistened to the strains with an appearance of pleasure, till the\r\nmonster, in whose soul there was no music, shot one of them to display\r\nhis archery. A learned native told me that he had frequently seen the\r\nmost venomous and malignant snakes leave their holes upon hearing tunes\r\non a flute, which, as he supposed, gave them peculiar delight. An\r\nintelligent Persian declared he had more than once been present, when a\r\ncelebrated lutenist, surnamed Bulbul (i.e., the nightingale), was\r\nplaying to a large company, in a grove near Shiraz, where he distinctly\r\nsaw the nightingales trying to vie with the musician, sometimes warbling\r\non the trees, sometimes fluttering from branch to branch, as if they\r\nwished to approach the instrument, and at length dropping on the ground\r\nin a kind of ecstacy, from which they were soon raised, he assured me,\r\nby a change in the mode.\"\r\n\r\nJackson of Exeter, in reply to a question of Dryden, \"What passion\r\ncannot music raise or quell?\" sarcastically returns, \"What passion _can_\r\nmusic raise or quell?\" Would not a savage, who had never listened to a\r\nmusical instrument, feel certain emotions at listening to one for the\r\nfirst time? But civilized man is, no doubt, particularly affected by\r\n_association of ideas_, as all pieces of national music evidently prove.\r\n\r\nTHE RANZ DES VACHES, mentioned by Rousseau in his Dictionary of Music,\r\nthough without anything striking in the composition, has such a powerful\r\ninfluence over the Swiss, and impresses them with so violent a desire to\r\nreturn to their own country, that it is forbidden to be played in the\r\nSwiss regiments, in the French service, on pain of death. There is also\r\na Scotch tune, which has the same effect on some of our North Britons.\r\nIn one of our battles in Calabria, a bagpiper of the 78th Highland\r\nregiment, when the light infantry charged the French, posted himself on\r\nthe right, and remained in his solitary situation during the whole of\r\nthe battle, encouraging the men with a famous Highland charging tune;\r\nand actually upon the retreat and complete rout of the French changed it\r\nto another, equally celebrated in Scotland, upon the retreat of and\r\nvictory over an enemy. His next-hand neighbour guarded him so well that\r\nhe escaped unhurt. This was the spirit of the \"Last Minstrel,\" who\r\ninfused courage among his countrymen, by possessing it in so animated a\r\ndegree, and in so venerable a character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINUTE WRITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Iliad of Homer in a nutshell, which Pliny says that Cicero once saw,\r\nit is pretended might have been a fact, however to some it may appear\r\nimpossible. Ælian notices an artist who wrote a distich in letters of\r\ngold, which he enclosed in the rind of a grain of corn.\r\n\r\nAntiquity and modern times record many such penmen, whose glory\r\nconsisted in writing in so small a hand that the writing could not be\r\nlegible to the naked eye. Menage mentions, he saw whole sentences which\r\nwere not perceptible to the eye without the microscope; pictures and\r\nportraits which appeared at first to be lines and scratches thrown down\r\nat random; one formed the face of the Dauphiness with the most correct\r\nresemblance. He read an Italian poem, in praise of this princess,\r\ncontaining some thousand verses, written by an officer, in a space of a\r\nfoot and a half. This species of curious idleness has not been lost in\r\nour own country, where this minute writing has equalled any on record.\r\nPeter Bales, a celebrated caligrapher in the reign of Elizabeth,\r\nastonished the eyes of beholders by showing them what they could not\r\nsee; for in the Harleian MSS. 530, we have a narrative of \"a rare piece\r\nof work brought to pass by Peter Bales, an Englishman, and a clerk of\r\nthe chancery;\" it seems by the description to have been the whole Bible\r\n\"in an English walnut no bigger than a hen's egg. The nut holdeth the\r\nbook: there are as many leaves in his little book as the great Bible,\r\nand he hath written as much in one of his little leaves as a great leaf\r\nof the Bible.\" We are told that this wonderfully unreadable copy of the\r\nBible was \"seen by many thousands.\" There is a drawing of the head of\r\nCharles I. in the library of St. John's College, at Oxford, wholly\r\ncomposed of minute written characters, which, at a small distance,\r\nresemble the lines of an engraving. The lines of the head, and the ruff,\r\nare said to contain the book of Psalms, the Creed, and the Lord's\r\nPrayer. In the British Museum we find a drawing representing the\r\nportrait of Queen Anne, not much above the size of the hand. On this\r\ndrawing appears a number of lines and scratches, which the librarian\r\nassures the marvelling spectator includes the entire contents of a thin\r\n_folio_, which on this occasion is carried in the hand.\r\n\r\nThe learned Huet asserts that, like the rest of the world, he considered\r\nas a fiction the story of that indefatigable trifler who is said to have\r\nenclosed the Iliad in a nutshell. Examining the matter more closely, he\r\nthought it possible. One day this learned man trifled half an hour in\r\ndemonstrating it. A piece of vellum, about ten inches in length and\r\neight in width, pliant and firm, can be folded up, and enclosed in the\r\nshell of a large walnut. It can hold in its breadth one line, which can\r\ncontain 30 verses, and in its length 250 lines. With a crow-quill the\r\nwriting can be perfect. A page of this piece of vellum will then contain\r\n7500 verses, and the reverse as much; the whole 15,000 verses of the\r\nIliad. And this he proved by using a piece of paper, and with a common\r\npen. The thing is possible to be effected; and if on any occasion paper\r\nshould be most excessively rare, it may be useful to know that a volume\r\nof matter may be contained in a single leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMERICAL FIGURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe learned, after many contests, have at length agreed that the\r\nnumerical figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, usually called _Arabic_,\r\nare of _Indian_ origin. The Arabians do not pretend to have been the\r\ninventors of them, but borrowed them from the Indian nations. The\r\nnumeral characters of the Bramins, the Persians, the Arabians, and other\r\neastern nations, are similar. They appear afterwards to have been\r\nintroduced into several European nations by their respective travellers,\r\nwho returned from the East. They were admitted into calendars and\r\nchronicles, but they were not introduced into charters, says Mr. Astle,\r\nbefore the sixteenth century. The Spaniards, no doubt, derived their use\r\nfrom the Moors who invaded them. In 1210, the Alphonsean astronomical\r\ntables were made by the order of Alphonsus X. by a Jew, and an Arabian;\r\nthey used these numerals, from whence the Spaniards contend that they\r\nwere first introduced by them.\r\n\r\nThey were not generally used in Germany until the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century; but in general the forms of the ciphers were not\r\npermanently fixed there till after the year 1531. The Russians were\r\nstrangers to them, before Peter the Great had finished his travels in\r\nthe beginning of the last century.\r\n\r\nThe origin of these useful characters with the Indians and Arabians is\r\nattributed to their great skill in the arts of astronomy and of\r\narithmetic, which required more convenient characters than alphabetic\r\nletters for the expressing of numbers.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction into Europe of these Arabic numerals, they used\r\nalphabetical characters, or _Roman numerals_. The learned authors of the\r\nNouveau Traité Diplomatique, the most valuable work on everything\r\nconcerning the arts and progress of writing, have given some curious\r\nnotices on the origin of the Roman numerals. Originally men counted by\r\ntheir fingers; thus, to mark the first four numbers they used an I,\r\nwhich naturally represents them. To mark the fifth, they chose a V,\r\nwhich is made out by bending inwards the three middle fingers, and\r\nstretching out only the thumb and the little finger; and for the tenth\r\nthey used an X, which is a double V, one placed topsy-turvy under the\r\nother. From this the progression of these numbers is always from one to\r\nfive, and from five to ten. The hundred was signified by the capital\r\nletter of that word in Latin, C--centum. The other letters, D for 500,\r\nand M for a 1000, were afterwards added. They subsequently abbreviated\r\ntheir characters, by placing one of these figures before another; and\r\nthe figure of less value before a higher number, denotes that so much\r\nmay be deducted from a greater number; for instance, IV signifies five\r\nless one, that is four; IX ten less one, that is nine; but these\r\nabbreviations are not found amongst the ancient monuments.[77] These\r\nnumerical letters are still continued by us in the accounts of our\r\nExchequer.\r\n\r\nThat men counted originally by their fingers, is no improbable\r\nsupposition; it is still naturally practised by the people. In\r\nsemi-civilized states small stones have been used, and the etymologists\r\nderive the words _calculate_ and _calculations_ from _calculus_, the\r\nLatin term for a pebble-stone, and by which they denominated their\r\ncounters used for arithmetical computations.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ward, in a learned dissertation on this subject in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, concludes that it is easier to falsify the\r\nArabic ciphers than the Roman alphabetical numerals; when 1375 is dated\r\nin Arabic ciphers, if the 3 is only changed into an 0, three centuries\r\nare taken away; if the 3 is made into a 9 and take away the 1, four\r\nhundred years are lost. Such accidents have assuredly produced much\r\nconfusion among our ancient manuscripts, and still do in our printed\r\nbooks; which is the reason that Dr. Robertson in his histories has also\r\npreferred writing his dates in _words_, rather than confide them to the\r\ncare of a negligent printer. Gibbon observes, that some remarkable\r\nmistakes have happened by the word _mil._ in MSS., which is an\r\nabbreviation for _soldiers_, or for _thousands_; and to this blunder he\r\nattributes the incredible numbers of martyrdoms, which cannot otherwise\r\nbe accounted for by historical records.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: A peculiar arrangement of letters was in use by the German\r\nand Flemish printers of the 16th century. Thus cI[R 'c'] denoted\r\n1000, and I[R 'c'], 500. The date 1619 would therefore be thus\r\nprinted:--cI[R 'c']. I[R 'c']cxx.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH ASTROLOGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA belief in judicial astrology can now only exist in the people, who may\r\nbe said to have no belief at all; for mere traditional sentiments can\r\nhardly be said to amount to a _belief_. But a faith in this ridiculous\r\nsystem in our country is of late existence; and was a favourite\r\nsuperstition with the learned.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles the First was confined, Lilly the astrologer was consulted\r\nfor the hour which would favour his escape.\r\n\r\nA story, which strongly proves how greatly Charles the Second was\r\nbigoted to judicial astrology, is recorded is Burnet's History of his\r\nOwn Times.\r\n\r\nThe most respectable characters of the age, Sir William Dugdale, Ellas\r\nAshmole, Dr. Grew, and others, were members of an astrological club.\r\nCongreve's character of Foresight, in Love for Love, was then no\r\nuncommon person, though the humour now is scarcely intelligible.\r\n\r\nDryden cast the nativities of his sons; and, what is remarkable, his\r\nprediction relating to his son Charles took place. This incident is of\r\nso late a date, one might hope it would have been cleared up.\r\n\r\nIn 1670, the passion for horoscopes and expounding the stars prevailed\r\nin France among the first rank. The new-born child was usually presented\r\nnaked to the astrologer, who read the first lineaments in his forehead,\r\nand the transverse lines in its hand, and thence wrote down its future\r\ndestiny. Catherine de Medicis brought Henry IV., then a child, to old\r\nNostradamus, whom antiquaries esteem more for his chronicle of Provence\r\nthan his vaticinating powers. The sight of the reverend seer, with a\r\nbeard which \"streamed like a meteor in the air,\" terrified the future\r\nhero, who dreaded a whipping from so grave a personage. One of these\r\nmagicians having assured Charles IX. that he would live as many days as\r\nhe should turn about on his heels in an hour, standing on one leg, his\r\nmajesty every morning performed that solemn gyration; the principal\r\nofficers of the court, the judges, the chancellors, and generals,\r\nlikewise, in compliment, standing on one leg and turning round!\r\n\r\nIt has been reported of several famous for their astrologic skill, that\r\nthey have suffered a voluntary death merely to verify their own\r\npredictions; this has been reported of _Cardan_, and _Burton_, the\r\nauthor of the Anatomy of Melancholy.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe the shifts to which astrologers are put when\r\ntheir predictions are not verified. Great _winds_ were predicted, by a\r\nfamous adept, about the year 1586. No unusual storms, however, happened.\r\nBodin, to save the reputation of the art, applied it as _figure_ to some\r\n_revolutions_ in the _state_, and of which there were instances enough\r\nat that moment. Among their lucky and unlucky days, they pretend to give\r\nthose of various illustrious persons and of families. One is very\r\nstriking.--Thursday was the unlucky day of our Henry VIII. He, his son\r\nEdward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, all died on a Thursday!\r\nThis fact had, no doubt, great weight in this controversy of the\r\nastrologers with their adversaries.[78]\r\n\r\nLilly, the astrologer, is the Sidrophel of Butler. His Life, written by\r\nhimself, contains so much artless narrative, and so much palpable\r\nimposture, that it is difficult to know when he is speaking what he\r\nreally believes to be the truth. In a sketch of the state of astrology\r\nin his day, those adepts, whose characters he has drawn, were the lowest\r\nmiscreants of the town. They all speak of each other as rogues and\r\nimpostors. Such were Booker, Backhouse, Gadbury; men who gained a\r\nlivelihood by practising on the credulity of even men of learning so\r\nlate as in 1650, nor were they much out of date in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. In Ashmole's Life an account of these artful impostors may be\r\nfound. Most of them had taken the air in the pillory, and others had\r\nconjured themselves up to the gallows. This seems a true statement of\r\nfacts. But Lilly informs us, that in his various conferences with\r\n_angels_, their voices resembled that of the _Irish_!\r\n\r\nThe work contains anecdotes of the times. The amours of Lilly with his\r\nmistress are characteristic. He was a very artful man, and admirably\r\nmanaged matters which required deception and invention.\r\n\r\nAstrology greatly flourished in the time of the civil wars. The\r\nroyalists and the rebels had their _astrologers_, as well as their\r\n_soldiers!_ and the predictions of the former had a great influence over\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, it may gratify curiosity to notice three or four works,\r\nwhich hear an excessive price. The price cannot entirely be occasioned\r\nby their rarity, and I am induced to suppose that we have still adepts,\r\nwhose faith must be strong, or whose scepticism but weak.\r\n\r\nThe Chaldean sages were nearly put to the rout by a quarto park of\r\nartillery, fired on them by Mr. John Chamber, in 1601. Apollo did not\r\nuse Marsyas more inhumanly than his scourging pen this mystical race,\r\nand his personalities made them feel more sore. However, a Norwich\r\nknight, the very Quixote of astrology, arrayed in the enchanted armour\r\nof his occult authors, encountered this pagan in a most stately\r\ncarousal. He came forth with \"A Defence of Judiciall Astrologye, in\r\nanswer to a treatise lately published by Mr. John Chamber. By Sir\r\nChristopher Heydon, Knight; printed at Cambridge, 1603.\" This is a\r\nhandsome quarto of about 500 pages. Sir Christopher is a learned writer,\r\nand a knight worthy to defend a better cause. But his Dulcinea had\r\nwrought most wonderfully on his imagination. This defence of this\r\nfanciful science, if science it may be called, demonstrates nothing,\r\nwhile it defends everything. It confutes, according to the knight's own\r\nideas: it alleges a few scattered facts in favour of astrological\r\npredictions, which may be picked up in that immensity of fabling which\r\ndisgraces history. He strenuously denies, or ridicules, what the\r\ngreatest writers have said against this fanciful art, while he lays\r\ngreat stress on some passages from authors of no authority. The most\r\npleasant part is at the close, where he defends the art from the\r\nobjections of Mr. Chamber by recrimination. Chamber had enriched himself\r\nby medical practice; and when he charges the astrologers with merely\r\naiming to gain a few beggarly pence, Sir Christopher catches fire, and\r\nshows by his quotations, that if we are to despise an art, by its\r\nprofessors attempting to subsist on it, or for the objections which may\r\nbe raised against its vital principles, we ought by this argument most\r\nheartily to despise the medical science and medical men! He gives here\r\nall he can collect against physic and physicians; and from the\r\nconfessions of Hippocrates and Galen, Avicenna and Agrippa, medicine\r\nappears to be a vainer science than even astrology! Sir Christopher is a\r\nshrewd and ingenious adversary; but when he says he means only to give\r\nMr. Chamber oil for his vinegar, he has totally mistaken its quality.\r\n\r\nThe defence was answered by Thomas Vicars, in his \"Madnesse of\r\nAstrologers.\"\r\n\r\nBut the great work is by Lilly; and entirely devoted to the adepts. He\r\ndefends nothing; for this oracle delivers his dictum, and details every\r\nevent as matters not questionable. He sits on the tripod; and every page\r\nis embellished by a horoscope, which he explains with the utmost\r\nfacility. This voluminous monument of the folly of the age is a quarto\r\nvalued at some guineas! It is entitled, \"Christian Astrology, modestly\r\ntreated of in three books, by William Lilly, student in Astrology, 2nd\r\nedition, 1659.\" The most curious part of this work is \"a Catalogue of\r\nmost astrological authors.\" There is also a portrait of this arch rogue,\r\nand astrologer: an admirable illustration for Lavater![79]\r\n\r\nLilly's opinions, and his pretended science, were such favourites with\r\nthe age, that the learned Gataker wrote professedly against this popular\r\ndelusion. Lilly, at the head of his star-expounding friends, not only\r\nformally replied to, but persecuted Gataker annually in his predictions,\r\nand even struck at his ghost, when beyond the grave. Gataker died in\r\nJuly, 1654; and Lilly having written in his almanac of that year for the\r\nmonth of August this barbarous Latin verse:--\r\n\r\n    _Hoc in tumbo jacet presbyter et nebulo!_\r\n    Here in this tomb lies a presbyter and a knave!\r\n\r\nhe had the impudence to assert that he had predicted Gataker's death!\r\nBut the truth is, it was an epitaph like lodgings to let; it stood empty\r\nready for the first passenger to inhabit. Had any other of that party of\r\nany eminence died in that month, it would have been as appositely\r\napplied to him. But Lilly was an exquisite rogue, and never at fault.\r\nHaving prophesied in his almanac for 1650, that the parliament stood\r\nupon a tottering foundation, when taken up by a messenger, during the\r\nnight he was confined, he contrived to cancel the page, printed off\r\nanother, and showed his copies before the committee, assuring them that\r\nthe others were none of his own, but forged by his enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: \"Day fatality\" was especially insisted on by these\r\nstudents, and is curiously noted in a folio tract, published in 1687,\r\nparticularly devoted to \"Remarques on the 14th of October, being the\r\nauspicious birth-day of his present Majesty James II.,\" whose author\r\nspeaks of having seen in the hands of \"that genera scholar, and great\r\nastrologer, E. Ashmole,\" a manuscript in which the following barbarous\r\nmonkish rhymes were inserted, noting the unlucky days of each month:--\r\n\r\n    JANUARY      Prima dies menses, et septima truncat ut ensis.\r\n    FEBRUARY     Quarta subit mortem, prosternit tertia fortem.\r\n    MARCH        Primus mandentem, disrumpit quarta bibentem.\r\n    APRIL        Denus et undenus est mortis vulnere plenus.\r\n    MAY          Tertius occidit, et septimus ora relidit.\r\n    JUNE         Denus pallescit, quindenus foedra nescit.\r\n    JULY         Ter-decimus mactat, Julii denus labefactat.\r\n    AUGUST       Prima necat fortem prosternit secunda cohortem.\r\n    SEPTEMBER    Tertia Septembris, et denus fert mala membris.\r\n    OCTOBER      Tertius et denus, est sicut mors alienus.\r\n    NOVEMBER     Scorpius est quintus, et tertius e nece cinctus.\r\n    DECEMBER     Septimus exanguis, virosus denus et anguis.\r\n\r\nThe author of this strange book fortifies his notions on \"day fatality\"\r\nby printing a letter from Sir Winstan Churchill, who says, \"I have made\r\ngreat experience of the truth of it, and have set down Fryday as my own\r\nlucky day; the day on which I was born, christened, married, and I\r\nbelieve will be the day of my death. The day whereon I have had sundry\r\ndeliverances from perils by sea and land, perils by false brethren,\r\nperils of lawsuits, &c. I was knighted (by chance unexpected of myself)\r\non the same day, and have several good accidents happened to me on that\r\nday; and am so superstitious in the belief of its good omen, that I\r\nchoose to begin any considerable action that concerns me on the same\r\nday.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Lilly was at one time a staunch adherent of the\r\nRoundheads, and \"read in the stars\" all kinds of successes for them. His\r\ngreat feat was a prediction made for the month of June, 1645--\"If now we\r\nfight, a victory stealeth upon us.\" A fight did occur at Naseby, and\r\nconcluded the overthrow of the unfortunate Charles the First. The words\r\nare sufficiently ambiguous; but not so much so, as many other\r\n\"prophecies\" of the same notable quack, happily constructed to shift\r\nwith changes in events, and so be made to fit them. Lilly was opposed by\r\nWharton, who saw in the stars as many good signs for the Royal Army; and\r\nLilly himself began to see differently as the power of Cromwell waned.\r\nAmong the hundreds of pamphlets poured from the press in the excited\r\ndays of the great civil wars in England, few are more curious than these\r\n\"strange and remarkable predictions,\" \"Signs in the Sky,\" and \"Warnings\r\nto England,\" the productions of star-gazing knaves, which \"terrified our\r\nisle from its propriety.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALCHYMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Thomas, the Corinna of Dryden, in her Life, has recorded one of the\r\ndelusions of alchymy.\r\n\r\nAn infatuated lover of this delusive art met with one who pretended to\r\nhave the power of transmuting lead to gold; that is, in their language,\r\nthe _imperfect_ metals to the _perfect one_. The hermetic philosopher\r\nrequired only the materials, and time, to perform his golden operations.\r\nHe was taken, to the country residence of his patroness. A long\r\nlaboratory was built, and that his labours might not be impeded by any\r\ndisturbance, no one was permitted to enter into it. His door was\r\ncontrived to turn on a pivot; so that, unseen and unseeing, his meals\r\nwere conveyed to him without distracting the sublime meditations of the\r\nsage.\r\n\r\nDuring a residence of two years, he never condescended to speak but two\r\nor three times in a year to his infatuated patroness. When she was\r\nadmitted into the laboratory, she saw, with pleasing astonishment,\r\nstills, cauldrons, long flues, and three or four Vulcanian fires blazing\r\nat different corners of this magical mine; nor did she behold with less\r\nreverence the venerable figure of the dusty philosopher. Pale and\r\nemaciated with daily operations and nightly vigils, he revealed to her,\r\nin unintelligible jargon, his progresses; and having sometimes\r\ncondescended to explain the mysteries of the arcana, she beheld, or\r\nseemed to behold, streams of fluid and heaps of solid ore scattered\r\naround the laboratory. Sometimes he required a new still, and sometimes\r\nvast quantities of lead. Already this unfortunate lady had expended the\r\nhalf of her fortune in supplying the demands of the philosopher. She\r\nbegan now to lower her imagination to the standard of reason. Two years\r\nhad now elapsed, vast quantities of lead had gone in, and nothing but\r\nlead had come out. She disclosed her sentiments to the philosopher. He\r\ncandidly confessed he was himself surprised at his tardy processes; but\r\nthat now he would exert himself to the utmost, and that he would venture\r\nto perform a laborious operation, which hitherto he had hoped not to\r\nhave been necessitated to employ. His patroness retired, and the golden\r\nvisions resumed all their lustre.\r\n\r\nOne day, as they sat at dinner, a terrible shriek, and one crack\r\nfollowed by another, loud as the report of cannon, assailed their ears.\r\nThey hastened to the laboratory; two of the greatest stills had burst,\r\nand one part of the laboratory and the house were in flames. We are told\r\nthat, after another adventure of this kind, this victim to alchymy,\r\nafter ruining another patron, in despair swallowed poison.\r\n\r\nEven more recently we have a history of an alchymist in the life of\r\nRomney, the painter. This alchymist, after bestowing much time and money\r\non preparations for the grand projection, and being near the decisive\r\nhour, was induced, by the too earnest request of his wife, to quit his\r\nfurnace one evening, to attend some of her company at the tea-table.\r\nWhile the projector was attending the ladies, his furnace blew up! In\r\nconsequence of this event, he conceived such an antipathy against his\r\nwife, that he could not endure the idea of living with her again.[80]\r\n\r\nHenry VI., Evelyn observes in his Numismata, endeavoured to recruit his\r\nempty coffers by _alchymy_. The _record_ of this singular proposition\r\ncontains \"the most solemn and serious account of the feasibility and\r\nvirtues of the _philosopher's stone_, encouraging the search after it,\r\nand dispensing with all statutes and prohibitions to the contrary.\" This\r\nrecord was probably communicated by Mr. Selden to his beloved friend Ben\r\nJonson, when the poet was writing his comedy of the Alchymist.\r\n\r\nAfter this patent was published, many promised to answer the king's\r\nexpectations so effectually, that the next year he published _another\r\npatent_; wherein he tells his subjects, that the _happy hour_ was\r\ndrawing nigh, and by means of THE STONE, which he should soon be master\r\nof, he would pay all the debts of the nation in real _gold and silver_.\r\nThe persons picked out for his new operators were as remarkable as the\r\npatent itself, being a most \"miscellaneous rabble\" of friars, grocers,\r\nmercers, and fishmongers!\r\n\r\nThis patent was likewise granted _authoritate Parliamenti_; and is given\r\nby Prynne in his _Aurum Reginæ_, p. 135.\r\n\r\nAlchymists were formerly called _multipliers_, although they never could\r\n_multiply_; as appears from a statute of Henry IV. repealed in the\r\npreceding record.\r\n\r\n\"None from henceforth shall use to _multiply_ gold or silver, or use the\r\n_craft of multiplication_; and if any the same do, he shall incur the\r\npain of felony.\" Among the articles charged on the Protector Somerset is\r\nthis extraordinary one:--\"You commanded _multiplication_ and\r\n_alcumestry_ to be practised, thereby _to abate the king's coin_.\"\r\nStowe, p. 601. What are we to understand? Did they believe that alchymy\r\nwould be so productive of the precious metals as to _abate_ the value of\r\nthe coin; or does _multiplication_ refer to an arbitrary rise in the\r\ncurrency by order of the government?\r\n\r\nEvery philosophical mind must be convinced that alchymy is not an art,\r\nwhich some have fancifully traced to the _remotest times_; it may be\r\nrather regarded, when opposed to such a distance of time, as a modern\r\nimposture. Cæsar commanded the treatises of alchymy to be burnt\r\nthroughout the Roman dominions: Cæsar, who is not less to be admired as\r\na philosopher than as a monarch.\r\n\r\nGibbon has this succinct passage relative to alchymy:--\"The ancient\r\nbooks of alchymy, so liberally ascribed to Pythagoras, to Solomon, or to\r\nHermes, were the pious frauds of more recent adepts. The Greeks were\r\ninattentive either to the use or the abuse of chemistry. In that immense\r\nregister where Pliny has deposited the discoveries, the arts, and the\r\nerrors of mankind, there is not the least mention of the transmutations\r\nof metals; and the persecution of Diocletian is the first authentic\r\nevent in the history of alchymy. The conquest of Egypt by the Arabs\r\ndiffused that vain science over the globe. Congenial to the avarice of\r\nthe human heart, it was studied in China, as in Europe, with equal\r\neagerness and equal success. The darkness of the middle ages ensured a\r\nfavourable reception to every tale of wonder; and the revival of\r\nlearning gave new vigour to hope, and suggested more specious arts to\r\ndeception. Philosophy, with the aid of experience, has at length\r\nbanished the study of alchymy; and the present age, however desirous of\r\nriches, is content to seek them by the humbler means of commerce and\r\nindustry.\"\r\n\r\nElias Ashmole writes in his diary--\"May 13, 1653. My father Backhouse\r\n(an astrologer who had adopted him for his son, a common practice with\r\nthese men) lying sick in Fleet-street, over against St. Dunstan's\r\nchurch, and not knowing whether he should live or die, about eleven of\r\nthe clock, told me in _syllables_ the true matter of the _philosopher's\r\nstone_, which he bequeathed to me as a _legacy_.\" By this we learn that\r\na miserable wretch knew the art of _making gold_, yet always lived a\r\nbeggar; and that Ashmole really imagined he was in possession of the\r\n_syllables of a secret_! He has, however, built a curious monument of\r\nthe learned follies of the last age, in his \"Theatrum Chemicum\r\nBritannicum.\" Though Ashmole is rather the historian of this vain\r\nscience than an adept, it may amuse literary leisure to turn over this\r\nquarto volume, in which he has collected the works of several English\r\nalchymists, subjoining his commentary. It affords a curious specimen of\r\nRosicrucian mysteries; and Ashmole relates several miraculous stories.\r\nOf the philosopher's stone, he says he knows enough to hold his tongue,\r\nbut not enough to speak. This stone has not only the power of\r\ntransmuting any imperfect earthy matter into its utmost degree of\r\nperfection, and can convert the basest metals into gold, flints into\r\nstone, &c.; but it has still more occult virtues, when the arcana have\r\nbeen entered into by the choice fathers of hermetic mysteries. The\r\nvegetable stone has power over the natures of man, beast, fowls, fishes,\r\nand all kinds of trees and plants, to make them flourish and bear fruit\r\nat any time. The magical stone discovers any person wherever he is\r\nconcealed; while the angelical stone gives the apparitions of angels,\r\nand a power of conversing with them. These great mysteries are supported\r\nby occasional facts, and illustrated by prints of the most divine and\r\nincomprehensible designs, which we would hope were intelligible to the\r\ninitiated. It may be worth showing, however, how liable even the latter\r\nwere to blunder on these mysterious hieroglyphics. Ashmole, in one of\r\nhis chemical works, prefixed a frontispiece, which, in several\r\ncompartments, exhibited Phoebus on a lion, and opposite to him a lady,\r\nwho represented Diana, with the moon in one hand and an arrow in the\r\nother, sitting on a crab; Mercury on a tripod, with the scheme of the\r\nheavens in one hand, and his caduccus in the other. These were intended\r\nto express the materials of the stone, and the season for the process.\r\nUpon the altar is the bust of a man, his head covered by an astrological\r\nscheme dropped from the clouds; and on the altar are these words,\r\n\"Mercuriophilus Anglicus,\" _i.e._, the English lover of hermetic\r\nphilosophy. There is a tree, and a little creature gnawing the root, a\r\npillar adorned with musical and mathematical instruments, and another\r\nwith military ensigns. This strange composition created great inquiry\r\namong the chemical sages. Deep mysteries were conjectured to be veiled\r\nby it. Verses were written in the highest strain of the Rosicrucian\r\nlanguage. _Ashmole_ confessed he meant nothing more than a kind of _pun_\r\non his own name, for the tree was the _ash_, and the creature was a\r\n_mole_. One pillar tells his love of music and freemasonry, and the\r\nother his military preferment and astrological studies! He afterwards\r\nregretted that no one added a second volume to his work, from which he\r\nhimself had been hindered, for the honour of the family of Hermes, and\r\n\"to show the world what excellent men we had once of our nation, famous\r\nfor this kind of philosophy, and masters of so transcendant a secret.\"\r\n\r\nModern chemistry is not without a _hope_, not to say a _certainty_, of\r\nverifying the golden visions of the alchymists. Dr. Girtanner, of\r\nGottingen, not long ago adventured the following prophecy: \"In the\r\n_nineteenth century_ the transmutation of metals will be generally known\r\nand practised. Every chemist and every artist will _make gold_; kitchen\r\nutensils will be of silver, and even gold, which will contribute more\r\nthan anything else to _prolong life_, poisoned at present by the oxides\r\nof copper, lead, and iron, which we daily swallow with our food.\" Phil.\r\nMag. vol. vi., p. 383. This sublime chemist, though he does not venture\r\nto predict that universal _elixir_, which is to prolong life at\r\npleasure, yet approximates to it. A chemical friend writes to me, that\r\n\"The _metals_ seem to be _composite bodies_, which nature is perpetually\r\npreparing; and it may be reserved for the future researches of science\r\nto trace, and perhaps to imitate, some of these curious operations.\" Sir\r\nHumphry Davy told me that he did not consider this undiscovered art an\r\nimpossible thing, but which, should it ever be discovered, would\r\ncertainly be useless.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: He was assisted in the art by one Williamson, a\r\nwatchmaker, of Dalton, Lancashire, with whom Romney lived in constant\r\ncompanionship. They were partners in a furnace, and had kept the fire\r\nburning for nine months, when the contents of the crucible began to\r\nassume the yellow hue which excited all their hopes; a few moments of\r\nneglect led to the catastrophe narrated above.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLES OF BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere it inquired of an ingenious writer what page of his work had\r\noccasioned him most perplexity, he would often point to the\r\n_title-page_. The curiosity which we there would excite, is, however,\r\nmost fastidious to gratify.\r\n\r\nAmong those who appear to have felt this irksome situation, are most of\r\nour periodical writers. The \"Tatler\" and the \"Spectator,\" enjoying\r\npriority of conception, have adopted titles with characteristic\r\nfelicity; but perhaps the invention of the authors begins to fail in the\r\n\"Reader,\" the \"Lover,\" and the \"Theatre!\" Succeeding writers were as\r\nunfortunate in their titles, as their works; such are the \"Universal\r\nSpectator,\" and the \"Lay Monastery.\" The copious mind of Johnson could\r\nnot discover an appropriate title, and indeed in the first \"Idler\"\r\nacknowledged his despair. The \"Rambler\" was so little understood, at the\r\ntime of its appearance, that a French journalist has translated it as\r\n\"_Le Chevalier Errant_;\" and when it was corrected to _L'Errant_, a\r\nforeigner drank Johnson's health one day, by innocently addressing him\r\nby the appellation of Mr. \"Vagabond!\" The \"Adventurer\" cannot be\r\nconsidered as a fortunate title; it is not appropriate to those pleasing\r\nmiscellanies, for any writer is an adventurer. The \"Lounger,\" the\r\n\"Mirror,\" and even the \"Connoisseur,\" if examined accurately, present\r\nnothing in the titles descriptive of the works. As for the \"World,\" it\r\ncould only have been given by the fashionable egotism of its authors,\r\nwho considered the world as merely a circuit round St. James's Street.\r\nWhen the celebrated father of reviews, _Le Journal des Sçavans_, was\r\nfirst published, the very title repulsed the public. The author was\r\nobliged in his succeeding volumes to soften it down, by explaining its\r\ngeneral tendency. He there assures the curious, that not only men of\r\nlearning and taste, but the humblest mechanic, may find a profitable\r\namusement. An English novel, published with the title of \"The Champion\r\nof Virtue,\" could find no readers; but afterwards passed through several\r\neditions under the happier invitation of \"The Old English Baron.\" \"The\r\nConcubine,\" a poem by Mickle, could never find purchasers, till it\r\nassumed the more delicate title of \"Sir Martyn.\"\r\n\r\nAs a subject of literary curiosity, some amusement may be gathered from\r\na glance at what has been doing in the world, concerning this important\r\nportion of every book.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish and many oriental authors were fond of allegorical titles,\r\nwhich always indicate the most puerile age of taste. The titles were\r\nusually adapted to their obscure works. It might exercise an able\r\nenigmatist to explain their allusions; for we must understand by \"The\r\nHeart of Aaron,\" that it is a commentary on several of the prophets.\r\n\"The Bones of Joseph\" is an introduction to the Talmud. \"The Garden of\r\nNuts,\" and \"The Golden Apples,\" are theological questions; and \"The\r\nPomegranate with its Flower,\" is a treatise of ceremonies, not any more\r\npractised. Jortin gives a title, which he says of all the fantastical\r\ntitles he can recollect is one of the prettiest. A rabbin published a\r\ncatalogue of rabbinical writers, and called it _Labia Dormientium_, from\r\nCantic. vii. 9. \"Like the best wine of my beloved that goeth down\r\nsweetly, causing _the lips of those that are asleep to speak_.\" It hath\r\na double meaning, of which he was not aware, for most of his rabbinical\r\nbrethren talk very much like _men in their sleep_.\r\n\r\nAlmost all their works bear such titles as\r\nbread--gold--silver--roses--eyes, &c.; in a word, anything that\r\nsignifies nothing.\r\n\r\nAffected title-pages were not peculiar to the orientals: the Greeks and\r\nthe Romans have shown a finer taste. They had their Cornucopias, or\r\nhorns of abundance--Limones, or meadows--Pinakidions, or\r\ntablets--Pancarpes, or all sorts of fruits; titles not unhappily adapted\r\nfor the miscellanists. The nine books of Herodotus, and the nine\r\nepistles of Æschines, were respectively honoured by the name of a Muse;\r\nand three orations of the latter, by those of the Graces.\r\n\r\nThe modern fanatics have had a most barbarous taste for titles. We could\r\nproduce numbers from abroad, and at home. Some works have been called,\r\n\"Matches lighted at the Divine Fire,\"--and one \"The Gun of Penitence:\" a\r\ncollection of passages from the fathers is called \"The Shop of the\r\nSpiritual Apothecary:\" we have \"The Bank of Faith,\" and \"The\r\nSixpennyworth of Divine Spirit:\" one of these works bears the following\r\nelaborate title: \"Some fine Biscuits baked in the Oven of Charity,\r\ncarefully conserved for the Chickens of the Church, the Sparrows of the\r\nSpirit, and the sweet Swallows of Salvation.\" Sometimes their quaintness\r\nhas some humour. Sir Humphrey Lind, a zealous puritan, published a work\r\nwhich a Jesuit answered by another, entitled \"A Pair of Spectacles for\r\nSir Humphrey Lind.\" The doughty knight retorted, by \"A Case for Sir\r\nHumphrey Lind's Spectacles.\"\r\n\r\nSome of these obscure titles have an entertaining absurdity; as \"The\r\nThree Daughters of Job,\" which is a treatise on the three virtues of\r\npatience, fortitude, and pain. \"The Innocent Love, or the Holy Knight,\"\r\nis a description of the ardours of a saint for the Virgin. \"The Sound of\r\nthe Trumpet,\" is a work on the day of judgment; and \"A Fan to drive away\r\nFlies,\" is a theological treatise on purgatory.\r\n\r\nWe must not write to the utter neglect of our title; and a fair author\r\nshould have the literary piety of ever having \"the fear of his\r\ntitle-page before his eyes.\" The following are improper titles. Don\r\nMatthews, chief huntsman to Philip IV. of Spain, entitled his book \"The\r\nOrigin and Dignity of the Royal House,\" but the entire work relates only\r\nto hunting. De Chantereine composed several moral essays, which being at\r\na loss how to entitle, he called \"The Education of a Prince.\" He would\r\npersuade the reader in his preface, that though they were not composed\r\nwith a view to this subject, they should not, however, be censured for\r\nthe title, as they partly related to the education of a prince. The\r\nworld was too sagacious to be duped, and the author in his second\r\nedition acknowledges the absurdity, drops \"the magnificent title,\" and\r\ncalls his work \"Moral Essays.\" Montaigne's immortal history of his own\r\nmind, for such are his \"Essays,\" has assumed perhaps too modest a title,\r\nand not sufficiently discriminative. Sorlin equivocally entitled a\r\ncollection of essays, \"The Walks of Richelieu,\" because they were\r\ncomposed at that place; \"The Attic Nights\" of Aulus Gellius were so\r\ncalled, because they were written in Attica. Mr. Tooke, in his\r\ngrammatical \"Diversions of Purley,\" must have deceived many.\r\n\r\nA rhodomontade title-page was once a great favourite. There was a time\r\nwhen the republic of letters was over-built with \"Palaces of Pleasure,\"\r\n\"Palaces of Honour,\" and \"Palaces of Eloquence;\" with \"Temples of\r\nMemory,\" and \"Theatres of Human Life,\" and \"Amphitheatres of\r\nProvidence;\" \"Pharoses, Gardens, Pictures, Treasures.\" The epistles of\r\nGuevara dazzled the public eye with their splendid title, for they were\r\ncalled \"Golden Epistles;\" and the \"Golden Legend\" of Voragine had been\r\nmore appropriately entitled leaden.\r\n\r\nThey were once so fond of novelty, that every book recommended itself by\r\nsuch titles as \"A new Method; new Elements of Geometry; the new Letter\r\nWriter, and the new Art of Cookery.\"\r\n\r\nTo excite the curiosity of the pious, some writers employed artifices of\r\na very ludicrous nature. Some made their titles rhyming echoes; as this\r\none of a father, who has given his works under the title of _Scalæ Alæ\r\nanimi_; and _Jesus esus novus Orbis_. Some have distributed them\r\naccording to the measure of time, as one Father Nadasi, the greater part\r\nof whose works are _years_, _months_, _weeks_, _days_, and _hours_. Some\r\nhave borrowed their titles from the parts of the body; and others have\r\nused quaint expressions, such as--_Think before you leap_--_We must all\r\ndie_--_Compel them to enter_. Some of our pious authors appear not to\r\nhave been aware that they were burlesquing religion. One Massieu having\r\nwritten a moral explanation of the solemn anthems sung in Advent, which\r\nbegin with the letter O, published this work under the punning title of\r\n_La douce Moelle, et la Sauce friande des os Savoureux de l'Avent_.[81]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Carraccioli assumed the ambiguous title of _La Jouissance\r\nde soi-même_. Seduced by the epicurean title of self-enjoyment, the sale\r\nof the work was continual with the libertines, who, however, found\r\nnothing but very tedious essays on religion and morality. In the sixth\r\nedition the marquis greatly exults in his successful contrivance; by\r\nwhich means he had punished the vicious curiosity of certain persons,\r\nand perhaps had persuaded some, whom otherwise his book might never have\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nIf a title be obscure, it raises a prejudice against the author; we are\r\napt to suppose that an ambiguous title is the effect of an intricate or\r\nconfused mind. Baillet censures the Ocean Macromicrocosmic of one Sachs.\r\nTo understand this title, a grammarian would send an inquirer to a\r\ngeographer, and he to a natural philosopher; neither would probably\r\nthink of recurring to a physician, to inform one that this ambiguous\r\ntitle signifies the connexion which exists between the motion of the\r\nwaters with that of the blood. He censures Leo Allatius for a title\r\nwhich appears to me not inelegantly conceived. This writer has entitled\r\none of his books the _Urban Bees_; it is an account of those illustrious\r\nwriters who flourished during the pontificate of one of the Barberinis.\r\nThe allusion refers to the _bees_ which were the arms of this family,\r\nand Urban VIII. is the Pope designed.\r\n\r\nThe false idea which a title conveys is alike prejudicial to the author\r\nand the reader. Titles are generally too prodigal of their promises, and\r\ntheir authors are contemned; but the works of modest authors, though\r\nthey present more than they promise, may fail of attracting notice by\r\ntheir extreme simplicity. In either case, a collector of books is\r\nprejudiced; he is induced to collect what merits no attention, or he\r\npasses over those valuable works whose titles may not happen to be\r\ninteresting. It is related of Pinelli, the celebrated collector of\r\nbooks, that the booksellers permitted him to remain hours, and sometimes\r\ndays, in their shops to examine books before he purchased. He was\r\ndesirous of not injuring his precious collection by useless\r\nacquisitions; but he confessed that he sometimes could not help being\r\ndazzled by magnificent titles, nor being mistaken by the simplicity of\r\nothers, which had been chosen by the modesty of their authors. After\r\nall, many authors are really neither so vain, nor so honest, as they\r\nappear; for magnificent, or simple titles, have often been given from\r\nthe difficulty of forming any others.\r\n\r\nIt is too often with the Titles of Books, as with those painted\r\nrepresentations exhibited by the keepers of wild beasts; where, in\r\ngeneral, the picture itself is made more striking and inviting to the\r\neye, than the inclosed animal is always found to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Religious parody seems to have carried no sense of\r\nimpropriety with it to the minds of the men of the 15th and 16th\r\ncenturies. Luther was an adept in this art, and the preachers who\r\nfollowed him continued the practice. The sermons of divines in the\r\nfollowing century often sought an attraction by quaint titles, such\r\nas--\"Heaven ravished\"--\"The Blacksmith, a sermon preached at Whitehall\r\nbefore the King,\" 1606. Beloe, in his _Anecdotes of Literature_, vol. 6,\r\nhas recorded many of these quaint titles, among them the\r\nfollowing:--\"_The Nail hit on the head_, and driven into the city and\r\ncathedral wall of Norwich. By John Carter, 1644.\" \"_The Wheel turned_ by\r\na voice from the throne of glory. By John Carter, 1647.\" \"_Two Sticks\r\nmade one_, or the excellence of Unity. By Matthew Mead, 1691.\" \"_Peter's\r\nNet let downe_, or the Fisher and the Fish, both prepared towards a\r\nblessed haven. By R. Matthew, 1634.\" In the middle of the last century\r\ntwo religious tracts were published, one bearing the alarming title,\r\n\"Die and be Damned,\" the other being termed, \"A sure Guide to Hell.\" The\r\nfirst was levelled against the preaching of the Methodists, and the\r\ntitle obtained from what the author asserts to be the words of\r\ncondemnation then frequently applied by them to all who differed from\r\ntheir creed. The second is a satirical attack on the prevalent follies\r\nand vices of the day, which form the surest \"guide,\" in the opinion of\r\nthe author, to the bottomless pit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY FOLLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greeks composed lipogrammatic works; works in which one letter of\r\nthe alphabet is omitted. A lipogrammatist is a letter-dropper. In this\r\nmanner Tryphiodorus wrote his Odyssey; he had not [Greek: alpha] in his\r\nfirst book, nor [Greek: beta] in his second; and so on with the\r\nsubsequent letters one after another. This Odyssey was an imitation of\r\nthe lipogrammatic Iliad of Nestor. Among other works of this kind,\r\nAthenæus mentions an ode by Pindar, in which he had purposely omitted\r\nthe letter S; so that this inept ingenuity appears to have been one of\r\nthose literary fashions which are sometimes encouraged even by those who\r\nshould first oppose such progresses into the realms of nonsense.\r\n\r\nThere is in Latin a little prose work of Fulgentius, which the author\r\ndivides into twenty-three chapters, according to the order of the\r\ntwenty-three letters of the Latin alphabet. From A to O are still\r\nremaining. The first chapter is with out A; the second without B; the\r\nthird without C; and so with the rest. There are five novels in prose of\r\nLopes de Vega; the first without A, the second without E, the third\r\nwithout I, &c. Who will attempt to verify them?\r\n\r\nThe Orientalists are not without this literary folly. A Persian poet\r\nread to the celebrated Jami a gazel of his own composition, which Jami\r\ndid not like: but the writer replied, it was notwithstanding a very\r\ncurious sonnet, for the _letter Aliff_ was not to be found in any one of\r\nthe words! Jami sarcastically replied, \"You can do a better thing yet;\r\ntake away _all the letters_ from every word you have written.\"\r\n\r\nTo these works may be added the _Ecloga de Calvis_, by Hugbald the monk.\r\nAll the words of this silly work begin with a C. It is printed in\r\nDornavius. _Pugna Porcorum_; all the words beginning with a P, in the\r\nNugæ Venales. _Canum cum cattis certamen_; the words beginning with a C:\r\na performance of the same kind in the same work. Gregorio Leti presented\r\na discourse to the Academy of the Humorists at Rome, throughout which he\r\nhad purposely omitted the letter R, and he entitled it the exiled R. A\r\nfriend having requested a copy, as a literary curiosity, for so he\r\nconsidered this idle performance, Leti, to show that this affair was not\r\nso difficult, replied by a copious answer of seven pages, in which he\r\nhad observed the same severe ostracism against the letter R! Lord\r\nNorth, in the court of James, I., has written a set of Sonnets, each of\r\nwhich begins with a successive letter of the alphabet. The Earl of\r\nRivers, in the reign of Edward IV., translated the Moral Proverbs of\r\nChristiana of Pisa, a poem of about two hundred lines, the greatest part\r\nof which he contrived to conclude with the letter E; an instance of his\r\nlordship's hard application, and the bad taste of an age which, Lord\r\nOrford observes, had witticisms and whims to struggle with, as well as\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nIt has been well observed of these minute triflers, that extreme\r\nexactness is the sublime of fools, whose labours may be well called, in\r\nthe language of Dryden,\r\n\r\n    Pangs without birth, and fruitless industry.\r\n\r\nAnd Martial says,\r\n\r\n    Turpe est difficiles habere nugas,\r\n    Et stultus labor est ineptiarum.\r\n\r\nWhich we may translate,\r\n\r\n    'Tis a folly to sweat o'er a difficult trifle,\r\n    And for silly devices invention to rifle.\r\n\r\nI shall not dwell on the wits who composed verses in the forms of\r\nhearts, wings, altars, and true-love knots; or as Ben Jonson describes\r\ntheir grotesque shapes,\r\n\r\n    A pair of scissors and a comb in verse.\r\n\r\nTom Nash, who loved to push the ludicrous to its extreme, in his amusing\r\ninvective against the classical Gabriel Harvey, tells us that \"he had\r\nwrit verses in all kinds; in form of a pair of gloves, a pair of\r\nspectacles, and a pair of pot-hooks,\" &c. They are not less absurd, who\r\nexpose to public ridicule the name of their mistress by employing it to\r\nform their acrostics. I have seen some of the latter where, _both sides_\r\nand _crossways_, the name of the mistress or the patron has been sent\r\ndown to posterity with eternal torture. When _one name_ is made out\r\n_four times_ in the same acrostic, the great difficulty must have been\r\nto have found words by which the letters forming the name should be\r\nforced to stand in their particular places. It might be incredible that\r\nso great a genius as Boccaccio could have lent himself to these literary\r\nfashions; yet one of the most gigantic of acrostics may be seen in his\r\nworks; it is a poem of fifty cantos! Ginguené has preserved a specimen\r\nin his Literary History of Italy, vol. iii. p.54. Puttenham, in \"The Art\r\nof Poesie,\" p. 75, gives several odd specimens of poems in the forms of\r\nlozenges, rhomboids, pillars, &c. Puttenham has contrived to form a\r\ndefence for describing and making such trifling devices. He has done\r\nmore: he has erected two pillars himself to the honour of Queen\r\nElizabeth; every pillar consists of a base of eight syllables, the shaft\r\nor middle of four, and the capital is equal with the base. The only\r\ndifference between the two pillars consists in this; in the one \"ye must\r\nread upwards,\" and in the other the reverse. These pillars,\r\nnotwithstanding this fortunate device and variation, may be fixed as two\r\ncolumns in the porch of the vast temple of literary folly.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period, when _words_ or _verse_ were tortured into such\r\nfantastic forms, that the trees in gardens were twisted and sheared into\r\nobelisks and giants, peacocks, or flower-pots. In a copy of verses, \"To\r\na hair of my mistress's eye-lash,\" the merit, next to the choice of the\r\nsubject, must have been the arrangement, or the disarrangement, of the\r\nwhole poem into the form of a heart. With a pair of wings many a sonnet\r\nfluttered, and a sacred hymn was expressed by the mystical triangle.\r\n_Acrostics_ are formed from the initial letters of every verse; but a\r\ndifferent conceit regulated _chronograms_, which were used to describe\r\n_dates_--the _numeral letters_, in whatever part of the word they stood,\r\nwere distinguished from other letters by being written in capitals. In\r\nthe following chronogram from Horace,\r\n\r\n    --_feriam sidera vertice_,\r\n\r\nby a strange elevation of CAPITALS the _chronogrammatist_ compels even\r\nHorace to give the year of our Lord thus,\r\n\r\n    --feriaM siDera VertIce. MDVI.\r\n\r\nThe Acrostic and the Chronogram are both ingeniously described in the\r\nmock epic of the Scribleriad.[82] The _initial letters_ of the\r\nacrostics are thus alluded to in the literary wars:--\r\n\r\n    Firm and compact, in three fair columns wove,\r\n    O'er the smooth plain, the bold _acrostics_ move;\r\n    _High_ o'er the rest, the TOWERING LEADERS rise\r\n    With _limbs gigantic_, and _superior size_.[83]\r\n\r\nBut the looser character of the _chronograms_, and the disorder in which\r\nthey are found, are ingeniously sung thus:--\r\n\r\n    Not thus the _looser chronograms_ prepare\r\n    Careless their troops, undisciplined to war;\r\n    With _rank irregular, confused_ they stand,\r\n    The CHIEFTAINS MINGLING with the vulgar band.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards adds others of the illegitimate race of wit:--\r\n\r\n    To join these squadrons, o'er the champaign came\r\n    A numerous race of no ignoble name;\r\n    _Riddle_ and _Rebus_, Riddle's dearest son,\r\n    And _false Conundrum_ and _insidious Pun_.\r\n    _Fustian_, who scarcely deigns to tread the ground,\r\n    And _Rondeau_, wheeling in repeated round.\r\n    On their fair standards, by the wind display'd,\r\n    _Eggs_, _altars_, _wings_, _pipes_, _axes_, were pourtray'd.\r\n\r\nI find the origin of _Bouts-rimés_, or \"Rhyming Ends,\" in Goujet's Bib.\r\nFr. xvi. p. 181. One Dulot, a foolish poet, when sonnets were in demand,\r\nhad a singular custom of preparing the rhymes of these poems to be\r\nfilled up at his leisure. Having been robbed of his papers, he was\r\nregretting most the loss of three hundred sonnets: his friends were\r\nastonished that he had written so many which they had never heard. \"They\r\nwere _blank sonnets_,\" he replied; and explained the mystery by\r\ndescribing his _Bouts-rimés_. The idea appeared ridiculously amusing;\r\nand it soon became fashionable to collect the most difficult rhymes, and\r\nfill up the lines.\r\n\r\nThe _Charade_ is of recent birth, and I cannot discover the origin of\r\nthis species of logogriphes. It was not known in France so late as in\r\n1771; in the great Dictionnaire de Trévoux, the term appears only as the\r\nname of an Indian sect of a military character. Its mystical conceits\r\nhave occasionally displayed singular felicity.\r\n\r\n_Anagrams_ were another whimsical invention; with the _letters_ of any\r\n_name_ they contrived to make out some entire word, descriptive of the\r\ncharacter of the person who bore the name. These anagrams, therefore,\r\nwere either satirical or complimentary. When in fashion, lovers made use\r\nof them continually: I have read of one, whose mistress's name was\r\nMagdalen, for whom he composed, not only an epic under that name, but as\r\na proof of his passion, one day he sent her three dozen of anagrams all\r\non her lovely name. Scioppius imagined himself fortunate that his\r\nadversary _Scaliger_ was perfectly _Sacrilege_ in all the oblique cases\r\nof the Latin language; on this principle Sir John _Wiat_ was made out,\r\nto his own satisfaction--_a wit_. They were not always correct when a\r\ngreat compliment was required; the poet _John Cleveland_ was strained\r\nhard to make _Heliconian dew_. This literary trifle has, however, in our\r\nown times produced several, equally ingenious and caustic.\r\n\r\nVerses of grotesque shapes have sometimes been contrived to convey\r\ningenious thoughts. Pannard, a modern French poet, has tortured his\r\nagreeable vein of poetry into such forms. He has made some of his\r\nBacchanalian songs to take the figures of _bottles_, and others of\r\n_glasses_. These objects are perfectly drawn by the various measures of\r\nthe verses which form the songs. He has also introduced an _echo_ in his\r\nverses which he contrives so as not to injure their sense. This was\r\npractised by the old French bards in the age of Marot, and this poetical\r\nwhim is ridiculed by Butler in his Hudibras, Part I. Canto 3, Verse 190.\r\nI give an example of these poetical echoes. The following ones are\r\ningenious, lively, and satirical:--\r\n\r\n        Pour nous plaire, un pl_umet_\r\n\r\n        _Met_\r\n\r\n        Tout en usage:\r\n\r\n        Mais on trouve sou_vent_\r\n\r\n        _Vent_\r\n\r\n        Dans son langage.\r\n\r\n        On y voit des Com_mis_\r\n\r\n        _Mis_\r\n\r\n        Comme des Princes,\r\n\r\n        Après être ve_nus_\r\n\r\n        _Nuds_\r\n\r\n        De leurs Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe poetical whim of Cretin, a French poet, brought into fashion punning\r\nor equivocal rhymes. Maret thus addressed him in his own way:--\r\n\r\n    L'homme, sotart, et _non sçavant_\r\n    Comme un rotisseur, _qui lave oye_,\r\n    La faute d'autrui, _nonce avant_,\r\n    Qu'il la cognoisse, ou _qu'il la voye_, &c.\r\n\r\nIn these lines of Du Bartas, this poet imagined that he imitated the\r\nharmonious notes of the lark: \"the sound\" is here, however, _not_ \"an\r\necho to the sense.\"\r\n\r\n    La gentille aloüette, avec son tirelire,\r\n    Tirelire, à lire, et tireliran, tire\r\n    Vers la voute du ciel, puis son vol vers ce lieu,\r\n    Vire et desire dire adieu Dieu, adieu Dieu.\r\n\r\nThe French have an ingenious kind of Nonsense Verses called\r\n_Amphigouries_. This word is composed of a Greek adverb signifying\r\n_about_, and of a substantive signifying _a circle_. The following is a\r\nspecimen, elegant in the selection of words, and what the French called\r\nrichly rhymed, but in fact they are fine verses without any meaning\r\nwhatever. Pope's Stanzas, said to be written by a _person of quality_,\r\nto ridicule the tuneful nonsense of certain bards, and which Gilbert\r\nWakefield mistook for a serious composition, and wrote two pages of\r\nCommentary to prove this song was disjointed, obscure, and absurd, is an\r\nexcellent specimen of these _Amphigouries_.\r\n\r\n        AMPHIGOURIE.\r\n\r\n        Qu'il est heureux de se defendre\r\n        Quand le coeur ne s'est pas rendu!\r\n        Mais qu'il est facheux de se rendre\r\n        Quand le bonheur est suspendu!\r\n\r\n        Par un discours sans suite et tendre,\r\n        Egarez un coeur éperdu;\r\n        Souvent par un mal-entendu\r\n        L'amant adroit se fait entendre.\r\n\r\n        IMITATED.\r\n\r\n        How happy to defend our heart,\r\n        When Love has never thrown a dart!\r\n        But ah! unhappy when it bends,\r\n        If pleasure her soft bliss suspends!\r\n        Sweet in a wild disordered strain,\r\n        A lost and wandering heart to gain!\r\n        Oft in mistaken language wooed,\r\n        The skilful lover's understood.\r\n\r\nThese verses have such a resemblance to meaning, that Fontenelle, having\r\nlistened to the song, imagined that he had a glimpse of sense, and\r\nrequested to have it repeated. \"Don't you perceive,\" said Madame Tencin,\r\n\"that they are _nonsense verses_?\" The malicious wit retorted, \"They are\r\nso much like the fine verses I have heard here, that it is not\r\nsurprising I should be for once mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Scribleriad\" we find a good account of _the Cento_. A Cento\r\nprimarily signifies a cloak made of patches. In poetry it denotes a work\r\nwholly composed of verses, or passages promiscuously taken from other\r\nauthors, only disposed in a new form or order, so as to compose a new\r\nwork and a new meaning. Ausonius has laid down the rules to be observed\r\nin composing _Cento's_. The pieces may be taken either from the same\r\npoet, or from several; and the verses may be either taken entire, or\r\ndivided into two; one half to be connected with another half taken\r\nelsewhere; but two verses are never to be taken together. Agreeable to\r\nthese rules, he has made a pleasant nuptial _Cento_ from Virgil.[84]\r\n\r\nThe Empress Eudoxia wrote the life of Jesus Christ, in centos taken from\r\nHomer; Proba Falconia from Virgil. Among these grave triflers may be\r\nmentioned Alexander Ross, who published \"Virgilius Evangelizans, sive\r\nHistoria Domini et Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi Virgilianis verbis et\r\nversibus descripta.\" It was republished in 1769.\r\n\r\nA more difficult whim is that of \"_Reciprocal Verses_,\" which give the\r\nsame words whether read backwards or forwards. The following lines by\r\nSidonius Apollinaris were once infinitely admired:--\r\n\r\n    _Signa te signa temere me tangis et angis.\r\n    Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor._\r\n\r\nThe reader has only to take the pains of reading the lines backwards,\r\nand he will find himself just where he was after all his fatigue.[85]\r\n\r\nCapitaine Lasphrise, a French self-taught poet, boasts of his\r\ninventions; among other singularities, one has at least the merit of _la\r\ndifficulté vaincue_. He asserts this novelty to be entirely his own; the\r\nlast word of every verse forms the first word of the following verse:\r\n\r\n    Falloit-il que le ciel me rendit amoureux\r\n    Amoureux, jouissant d'une beauté craintive,\r\n    Craintive à recevoir la douceur excessive,\r\n    Excessive au plaisir qui rend l'amant heureux;\r\n    Heureux si nous avions quelques paisibles lieux,\r\n    Lieux où plus surement l'ami fidèle arrive,\r\n    Arrive sans soupçon de quelque ami attentive,\r\n    Attentive à vouloir nous surprendre tous deux.\r\n\r\nFrancis Colonna, an Italian Monk, is the author of a singular book\r\nentitled \"The Dream of Poliphilus,\" in which he relates his amours with\r\na lady of the name of Polia. It was considered improper to prefix his\r\nname to the work; but being desirous of marking it by some peculiarity,\r\nthat he might claim it at any distant day, he contrived that the initial\r\nletters of every chapter should be formed of those of his name, and of\r\nthe subject he treats. This strange invention was not discovered till\r\nmany years afterwards: when the wits employed themselves in deciphering\r\nit, unfortunately it became a source of literary altercation, being\r\nsusceptible of various readings. The correct appears thus:--POLIAM\r\nFRATER FRANCISCUS COLUMNA PERAMAVIT. \"Brother Francis Colonna\r\npassionately loved Polia.\" This gallant monk, like another Petrarch,\r\nmade the name of his mistress the subject of his amatorial meditations;\r\nand as the first called his Laura, his Laurel, this called his Polia,\r\nhis Polita.\r\n\r\nA few years afterwards, Marcellus Palingenius Stellatus employed a\r\nsimilar artifice in his ZODIACUS VITÆ, \"The Zodiac of Life:\" the initial\r\nletters of the first twenty-nine verses of the first book of this poem\r\nforming his name, which curious particular was probably unknown to\r\nWarton in his account of this work.--The performance is divided into\r\ntwelve books, but has no reference to astronomy, which we might\r\nnaturally expect. He distinguished his twelve books by the twelve names\r\nof the celestial signs, and probably extended or confined them purposely\r\nto that number, to humour his fancy. Warton, however, observes, \"This\r\nstrange pedantic title is not totally without a _conceit_, as the author\r\nwas born at _Stellada_ or _Stellata_, a province of Ferrara, and from\r\nwhence he called himself Marcellus Palingenius Stellatus.\" The work\r\nitself is a curious satire on the Pope and the Church of Rome. It\r\noccasioned Bayle to commit a remarkable _literary blunder_, which I\r\nshall record in its place. Of Italian conceit in those times, of which\r\nPetrarch was the father, with his perpetual play on words and on his\r\n_Laurel_, or his mistress _Laura_, he has himself afforded a remarkable\r\nexample. Our poet lost his mother, who died in her thirty-eighth year:\r\nhe has commemorated her death by a sonnet composed of thirty-eight\r\nlines. He seems to have conceived that the exactness of the number was\r\nequally natural and tender.\r\n\r\nAre we not to class among _literary follies_ the strange researches\r\nwhich writers, even of the present day, have made in _Antediluvian_\r\ntimes? Forgeries of the grossest nature have been alluded to, or quoted\r\nas authorities. A _Book of Enoch_ once attracted considerable attention;\r\nthis curious forgery has been recently translated. The Sabeans pretend\r\nthey possess a work written by _Adam_! and this work has been _recently_\r\nappealed to in favour of a visionary theory![86] Astle gravely observes,\r\nthat \"with respect to _Writings_ attributed to the _Antediluvians_, it\r\nseems not only decent but rational to say that we know nothing\r\nconcerning them.\" Without alluding to living writers, Dr. Parsons, in\r\nhis erudite \"Remains of Japhet,\" tracing the origin of the alphabetical\r\ncharacter, supposes that _letters_ were known to _Adam_! Some, too, have\r\nnoticed astronomical libraries in the Ark of Noah! Such historical\r\nmemorials are the deliriums of learning, or are founded on forgeries.\r\n\r\nHugh Broughton, a writer of controversy in the reign of James the First,\r\nshows us, in a tedious discussion on Scripture chronology, that Rahab\r\nwas a harlot at _ten_ years of age; and enters into many grave\r\ndiscussions concerning the _colour_ of Aaron's _ephod_, and the language\r\nwhich _Eve_ first spoke. This writer is ridiculed in Ben Jonson's\r\nComedies:--he is not without rivals even in the present day!\r\nCovarruvias, after others of his school, discovers that when male\r\nchildren are born they cry out with an A, being the first vowel of the\r\nword _Adam_, while the female infants prefer the letter E, in allusion\r\nto _Eve_; and we may add that, by the pinch of a negligent nurse, they\r\nmay probably learn all their vowels. Of the pedantic triflings of\r\ncommentators, a controversy among the Portuguese on the works of Camoens\r\nis not the least. Some of these profound critics, who affected great\r\ndelicacy in the laws of epic poetry, pretended to be doubtful whether\r\nthe poet had fixed on the right time for a _king's dream_; whether, said\r\nthey, a king should have a propitious dream on his _first going to bed_\r\nor at the _dawn of the following morning_? No one seemed to be quite\r\ncertain; they puzzled each other till the controversy closed in this\r\nfelicitous manner, and satisfied both the night and the dawn critics.\r\nBarreto discovered that an _accent_ on one of the words alluded to in\r\nthe controversy would answer the purpose, and by making king Manuel's\r\ndream to take place at the dawn would restore Camoens to their good\r\nopinion, and preserve the dignity of the poet.\r\n\r\nChevreau begins his History of the World in these words:--\"Several\r\nlearned men have examined in _what season_ God created the world, though\r\nthere could hardly be any season then, since there was no sun, no moon,\r\nnor stars. But as the world must have been created in one of the four\r\nseasons, this question has exercised the talents of the most curious,\r\nand opinions are various. Some say it was in the month of _Nisan_, that\r\nis, in the spring: others maintain that it was in the month of _Tisri_,\r\nwhich begins the civil year of the Jews, and that it was on the _sixth\r\nday_ of this month, which answers to our _September_, that _Adam_ and\r\n_Eve_ were created, and that it was on a _Friday_, a little after four\r\no'clock in the afternoon!\" This is according to the Rabbinical notion\r\nof the eve of the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nThe Irish antiquaries mention _public libraries_ that were before the\r\nflood; and Paul Christian Ilsker, with profounder erudition, has given\r\nan exact catalogue of _Adam's_. Messieurs O'Flaherty, O'Connor, and\r\nO'Halloran, have most gravely recorded as authentic narrations the\r\nwildest legendary traditions; and more recently, to make confusion\r\ndoubly confounded, others have built up what they call theoretical\r\nhistories on these nursery tales. By which species of black art they\r\ncontrive to prove that an Irishman is an Indian, and a Peruvian may be a\r\nWelshman, from certain emigrations which took place many centuries\r\nbefore Christ, and some about two centuries after the flood! Keating, in\r\nhis \"History of Ireland,\" starts a favourite hero in the giant\r\nPartholanus, who was descended from Japhet, and landed on the coast of\r\nMunster 14th May, in the year of the world 1987. This giant succeeded in\r\nhis enterprise, but a domestic misfortune attended him among his Irish\r\nfriends:--his wife exposed him to their laughter by her loose behaviour,\r\nand provoked him to such a degree that he killed two favourite\r\ngreyhounds; and this the learned historian assures us was the _first_\r\ninstance of female infidelity ever known in Ireland!\r\n\r\nThe learned, not contented with Homer's poetical pre-eminence, make him\r\nthe most authentic historian and most accurate geographer of antiquity,\r\nbesides endowing him with all the arts and sciences to be found in our\r\nEncyclopædia. Even in surgery, a treatise has been written to show, by\r\nthe variety of the _wounds_ of his heroes, that he was a most scientific\r\nanatomist; and a military scholar has lately told us, that from him is\r\nderived all the science of the modern adjutant and quarter-master\r\ngeneral; all the knowledge of _tactics_ which we now possess; and that\r\nXenophon, Epaminondas, Philip, and Alexander, owed all their warlike\r\nreputation to Homer!\r\n\r\nTo return to pleasanter follies. Des Fontaines, the journalist, who had\r\nwit and malice, inserted the fragment of a letter which the poet\r\nRousseau wrote to the younger Racine whilst he was at the Hague. These\r\nwere the words: \"I enjoy the conversation within these few days of my\r\nassociates in Parnassus. Mr. Piron is an excellent antidote against\r\nmelancholy; _but_\"--&c. Des Fontaines maliciously stopped at this _but_.\r\nIn the letter of Rousseau it was, \"but unfortunately he departs soon.\"\r\nPiron was very sensibly affected at this equivocal _but_, and resolved\r\nto revenge himself by composing one hundred epigrams against the\r\nmalignant critic. He had written sixty before Des Fontaines died: but of\r\nthese only two attracted any notice.\r\n\r\nTowards the conclusion of the fifteenth century, Antonio Cornezano wrote\r\na hundred different sonnets on one subject, \"the eyes of his mistress!\"\r\nto which possibly Shakspeare may allude, when Jaques describes a lover,\r\nwith his\r\n\r\n                    Woeful ballad,\r\n    Made to his mistress' eyebrow.\r\n\r\nNot inferior to this ingenious trifler is Nicholas Franco, well known in\r\nItalian literature, who employed himself in writing two hundred and\r\neighteen satiric sonnets, chiefly on the famous Peter Aretin. This\r\nlampooner had the honour of being hanged at Rome for his defamatory\r\npublications. In the same class are to be placed two other writers.\r\nBrebeuf, who wrote one hundred and fifty epigrams against a painted\r\nlady. Another wit, desirous of emulating him, and for a literary\r\nbravado, _continued_ the same subject, and pointed at this unfortunate\r\nfair three hundred more, without once repeating the thoughts of Brebeuf!\r\nThere is a collection of poems called \"_La_ PUCE _des grands jours de\r\nPoitiers_.\" \"The FLEA of the carnival of Poietiers.\" These poems were\r\nbegun by the learned Pasquier, who edited the collection, upon a FLEA\r\nwhich was found one morning in the bosom of the famous Catherine des\r\nRoches!\r\n\r\nNot long ago, a Mr. and Mrs. Bilderdyk, in Flanders, published poems\r\nunder the whimsical title of \"White and Red.\"--His own poems were called\r\nwhite, from the colour of his hair; and those of his lady red, in\r\nallusion to the colour of the rose. The idea must be Flemish!\r\n\r\nGildon, in his \"Laws of Poetry,\" commenting on this line of the Duke of\r\nBuckingham's \"Essay on Poetry,\"\r\n\r\n    Nature's chief masterpiece is _writing well_:\r\n\r\nvery profoundly informs his readers \"That what is here said has not the\r\nleast regard to the _penmanship_, that is, to the fairness or badness of\r\nthe handwriting,\" and proceeds throughout a whole page, with a panegyric\r\non a _fine handwriting_! The stupidity of dulness seems to have at times\r\ngreat claims to originality!\r\n\r\nLittleton, the author of the Latin and English Dictionary, seems to\r\nhave indulged his favourite propensity to punning so far as even to\r\nintroduce a pun in the grave and elaborate work of a Lexicon. A story\r\nhas been raised to account for it, and it has been ascribed to the\r\nimpatient interjection of the lexicographer to his scribe, who, taking\r\nno offence at the peevishness of his master, put it down in the\r\nDictionary. The article alluded to is, \"CONCURRO, to run with others; to\r\nrun together; to come together; to fall foul of one another; to\r\nCON-_cur,_ to CON-_dog_.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Todd, in his Dictionary, has laboured to show the \"inaccuracy of\r\nthis pretended narrative.\" Yet a similar blunder appears to have\r\nhappened to Ash. Johnson, while composing his Dictionary, sent a note to\r\nthe Gentleman's Magazine to inquire the etymology of the word\r\n_curmudgeon_. Having obtained the information, he records in his work\r\nthe obligation to an anonymous letter-writer. \"Curmudgeon, a vicious way\r\nof pronouncing _coeur méchant_. An unknown correspondent.\" Ash copied\r\nthe word into his dictionary in this manner: \"Curmudgeon: from the\r\nFrench _coeur_ unknown; and _méchant_, a correspondent.\" This singular\r\nnegligence ought to be placed in the class of our _literary blunders_;\r\nthese form a pair of lexicographical anecdotes.\r\n\r\nTwo singular literary follies have been practised on Milton. There is a\r\n_prose version_ of his \"Paradise Lost,\" which was innocently\r\n_translated_ from the French version of his epic! One Green published a\r\nspecimen of a _new version_ of the \"Paradise Lost\" into _blank verse_!\r\nFor this purpose he has utterly ruined the harmony of Milton's cadences,\r\nby what he conceived to be \"bringing that amazing work somewhat _nearer\r\nthe summit of perfection_.\"\r\n\r\nA French author, when his book had been received by the French Academy,\r\nhad the portrait of Cardinal Richelieu engraved on his title-page,\r\nencircled by a crown of _forty rays_, in each of which was written the\r\nname of the celebrated _forty academicians_.\r\n\r\nThe self-exaltation frequently employed by injudicious writers,\r\nsometimes places them in ridiculous attitudes. A writer of a bad\r\ndictionary, which he intended for a Cyclopaedia, formed such an opinion\r\nof its extensive sale, that he put on the title-page the words \"_first\r\nedition_,\" a hint to the gentle reader that it would not be the last.\r\nDesmarest was so delighted with his \"Clovis,\" an epic poem, that he\r\nsolemnly concludes his preface with a thanksgiving to God, to whom he\r\nattributes all its glory! This is like that conceited member of a French\r\nParliament, who was overheard, after his tedious harangue, muttering\r\nmost devoutly to himself, \"_Non nobis Domine_.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral works have been produced from some odd coincidence with the\r\n_name of their authors_. Thus, De Saussay has written a folio volume,\r\nconsisting of panegyrics of persons of eminence whose Christian names\r\nwere _Andrew_; because _Andrew_ was his own name. Two Jesuits made a\r\nsimilar collection of illustrious men whose Christian names were\r\n_Theophilus_ and _Philip_, being their own. _Anthony Saunderus_ has also\r\ncomposed a treatise of illustrious _Anthonies_! And we have one\r\n_Buchanan_, who has written the lives of those persons who were so\r\nfortunate as to have been his namesakes.\r\n\r\nSeveral forgotten writers have frequently been intruded on the public\r\neye, merely through such trifling coincidences as being members of some\r\nparticular society, or natives of some particular country. Cordeliers\r\nhave stood forward to revive the writings of Duns Scotus, because he had\r\nbeen a cordelier; and a Jesuit compiled a folio on the antiquities of a\r\nprovince, merely from the circumstance that the founder of his order,\r\nIgnatius Loyola, had been born there. Several of the classics are\r\nviolently extolled above others, merely from the accidental circumstance\r\nof their editors having collected a vast number of notes, which they\r\nresolved to discharge on the public. County histories have been\r\nfrequently compiled, and provincial writers have received a temporary\r\nexistence, from the accident of some obscure individual being an\r\ninhabitant of some obscure town.\r\n\r\nOn such literary follies Malebranche has made this refined observation.\r\nThe _critics_, standing in some way connected with _the author_, their\r\n_self-love_ inspires them, and abundantly furnishes eulogiums which the\r\nauthor never merited, that they may thus obliquely reflect some praise\r\non themselves. This is made so adroitly, so delicately, and so\r\nconcealed, that it is not perceived.\r\n\r\nThe following are strange inventions, originating in the wilful bad\r\ntaste of the authors. OTTO VENIUS, the master of Rubens, is the designer\r\nof _Le Théâtre moral de la Vie humaine_. In this emblematical history of\r\nhuman life, he has taken his subjects from Horace; but certainly his\r\nconceptions are not Horatian. He takes every image in a _literal_\r\nsense. If Horace says, \"_Misce stultitiam_ CONSILIIS BREVEM,\" behold,\r\nVenius takes _brevis_ personally, and represents Folly as a _little\r\nshort child_! of not above three or four years old! In the emblem which\r\nanswers Horace's \"_Raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit_ PEDE POENA\r\nCLAUDO,\" we find Punishment with _a wooden leg_.--And for \"PULVIS ET\r\nUMBRA SUMUS,\" we have a dark burying vault, with _dust_ sprinkled about\r\nthe floor, and a _shadow_ walking upright between two ranges of urns.\r\nFor \"_Virtus est vitium fugere, et sapientia prima stultitiâ caruisse_,\"\r\nmost flatly he gives seven or eight Vices pursuing Virtue, and Folly\r\njust at the heels of Wisdom. I saw in an English Bible printed in\r\nHolland an instance of the same taste: the artist, to illustrate \"Thou\r\nseest the _mote_ in thy neighbour's eye, but not the _beam_ in thine\r\nown,\" has actually placed an immense beam which projects from the eye of\r\nthe cavalier to the ground![87]\r\n\r\nAs a contrast to the too obvious taste of VENIUS, may be placed CESARE\r\nDI RIPA, who is the author of an Italian work, translated into most\r\nEuropean languages, the _Iconologia_; the favourite book of the age, and\r\nthe fertile parent of the most absurd offspring which Taste has known.\r\nRipa is as darkly subtle as Venius is obvious; and as far-fetched in his\r\nconceits as the other is literal. Ripa represents Beauty by a naked\r\nlady, with her head in a cloud; because the true idea of beauty is hard\r\nto be conceived! Flattery, by a lady with a flute in her hand, and a\r\nstag at her feet; because stags are said to love music so much, that\r\nthey suffer themselves to be taken, if you play to them on a flute.\r\nFraud, with two hearts in one hand, and a mask in the other;--his\r\ncollection is too numerous to point out more instances. Ripa also\r\ndescribes how the allegorical figures are to be coloured; Hope is to\r\nhave a sky-blue robe, because she always looks towards heaven. Enough of\r\nthese _capriccios_!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: The Scribleriad is a poem now scarcely known. It was a\r\npartial imitation of the Dunciad written by Richard Owen Cambridge, a\r\nscholar and man of fortune, who, in his residence at Twickenham,\r\nsurrounded by friends of congenial tastes, enjoyed a life of literary\r\nease. The Scribleriad is an attack on pseudo-science, the hero being a\r\nvirtuoso of the most Quixotic kind, who travels far to discover\r\nrarities, loves a lady with the _plica Polonica_, waits three years at\r\nNaples to see the eruption of Vesuvius; and plays all kinds of fantastic\r\ntricks, as if in continual ridicule of _The Philosophical Transactions_,\r\nwhich are especially aimed at in the notes which accompany the poem. It\r\nachieved considerable notoriety in its own day, and is not without\r\nmerit. It was published by Dodsley, in 1751, in a handsome quarto, with\r\nsome good engravings by Boitard.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Thomas Jordan, a poet of the time of Charles II., has the\r\nfollowing specimen of a double acrostic, which must have occupied a\r\nlarge amount of labour. He calls it \"a cross acrostick on two crost\r\nlovers.\" The man's name running through from top to bottom, and the\r\nfemale's the contrary way of the poem.\r\n\r\n    Though crost in our affections, still the flames\r\n    Of Honour shall secure our noble Names;\r\n    Nor shall Our fate divorce our faith, Or cause\r\n    The least Mislike of love's Diviner lawes.\r\n    Crosses sometimes Are cures, Now let us prove,\r\n    That no strength Shall Abate the power of love:\r\n    Honour, wit, beauty, Riches, wise men call\r\n    Frail fortune's Badges, In true love lies all.\r\n    Therefore to him we Yield, our Vowes shall be\r\n    Paid--Read, and written in Eternity:\r\n    That All may know when men grant no Redress,\r\n    Much love can sweeten the unhappinesS.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: The following example, barbarously made up in this way\r\nfrom passages in the Æneid and the Georgics, is by Stephen de Pleurre,\r\nand describes the adoration of the Magi.

It is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Lewd did I live, evil I did dwel.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: We need feel little wonder at this when \"The Book of\r\nMormon\" could be fabricated in our own time, and, with abundant evidence\r\nof that fact, yet become the Gospel of a very large number of persons.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: There are several instances of this ludicrous literal\r\nrepresentation. Daniel Hopfer, a German engraver of the 16th century,\r\npublished a large print of this subject; the scene is laid in the\r\ninterior of a Gothic church, and _the beam_ is a solid squared piece of\r\ntimber, reaching from the eye of the man to the walls of the building.\r\nThis peculiar mode of treating the subject may be traced to the earliest\r\npicture-books--thus the _Ars Memorandi_, a block-book of the early part\r\nof the 15th century, represents this figure of speech by a piece of\r\ntimber transfixing a human eye.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY CONTROVERSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the article MILTON, I had occasion to give some strictures on the\r\nasperity of literary controversy, drawn from his own and Salmasius's\r\nwritings. If to some the subject has appeared exceptionable, to me, I\r\nconfess, it seems useful, and I shall therefore add some other\r\nparticulars; for this topic has many branches. Of the following\r\nspecimens the grossness and malignity are extreme; yet they were\r\nemployed by the first scholars in Europe.\r\n\r\nMartin Luther was not destitute of genius, of learning, or of eloquence;\r\nbut his violence disfigured his works with singularities of abuse. The\r\ngreat reformer of superstition had himself all the vulgar ones of his\r\nday; he believed that flies were devils; and that he had had a buffeting\r\nwith Satan, when his left ear felt the prodigious beating. Hear him\r\nexpress himself on the Catholic divines: \"The Papists are all asses, and\r\nwill always remain asses. Put them in whatever sauce you choose, boiled,\r\nroasted, baked, fried, skinned, beat, hashed, they are always the same\r\nasses.\"\r\n\r\nGentle and moderate, compared with a salute to his holiness:--\"The Pope\r\nwas born out of the Devil's posteriors. He is full of devils, lies,\r\nblasphemies, and idolatries; he is anti-Christ; the robber of churches;\r\nthe ravisher of virgins; the greatest of pimps; the governor of Sodom,\r\n&c. If the Turks lay hold of us, then we shall be in the hands of the\r\nDevil; but if we remain with the Pope, we shall be in hell.--What a\r\npleasing sight would it be to see the Pope and the Cardinals hanging on\r\none gallows in exact order, like the seals which dangle from the bulls\r\nof the Pope! What an excellent council would they hold under the\r\ngallows!\"[88]\r\n\r\nSometimes, desirous of catching the attention of the vulgar, Luther\r\nattempts to enliven his style by the grossest buffooneries: \"Take care,\r\nmy little Popa! my little ass! Go on slowly: the times are slippery:\r\nthis year is dangerous: if them fallest, they will exclaim, See! how\r\nour little Pope is spoilt!\" It was fortunate for the cause of the\r\nReformation that the violence of Luther was softened in a considerable\r\ndegree by the meek Melancthon, who often poured honey on the sting\r\ninflicted by the angry wasp. Luther was no respecter of kings; he was so\r\nfortunate, indeed, as to find among his antagonists a crowned head; a\r\ngreat good fortune for an obscure controversialist, and the very\r\n_punctum saliens_ of controversy. Our Henry VIII. wrote his book against\r\nthe new doctrine: then warm from scholastic studies, Henry presented Leo\r\nX. with a work highly creditable to his abilities, according to the\r\ngenius of the age. Collier, in his Ecclesiastical History, has analysed\r\nthe book, and does not ill describe its spirit: \"Henry seems superior to\r\nhis adversary in the vigour and propriety of his style, in the force of\r\nhis reasoning, and the learning of his citations. It is true he leans\r\n_too much_ upon his character, argues in his _garter-robes_, and writes\r\nas 'twere with his _sceptre_.\" But Luther in reply abandons his pen to\r\nall kinds of railing and abuse. He addresses Henry VIII. in the\r\nfollowing style: \"It is hard to say if folly can be more foolish, or\r\nstupidity more stupid, than is the head of Henry. He has not attacked me\r\nwith the heart of a king, but with the impudence of a knave. This rotten\r\nworm of the earth having blasphemed the majesty of my king, I have a\r\njust right to bespatter his English majesty with his own dirt and\r\nordure. This Henry has lied.\" Some of his original expressions to our\r\nHenry VIII. are these: \"Stulta, ridicula, et verissimè _Henricicana_ et\r\n_Thomastica_ sunt hæc--Regem Angliæ Henricum istum planè mentiri,\r\n&c.--Hoc agit inquietus Satan, ut nos a Scripturis avocet per\r\n_sceleratos Henricos_,\" &c.--He was repaid with capital and interest by\r\nan anonymous reply, said to have been written by Sir Thomas More, who\r\nconcludes his arguments by leaving Luther in language not necessary to\r\ntranslate: \"cum suis furiis et furoribus, cum suis merdis et stercoribus\r\ncacantem cacatumque.\" Such were the vigorous elegancies of a controversy\r\non the Seven Sacraments! Long after, the court of Rome had not lost the\r\ntaste of these \"bitter herbs:\" for in the bull of the canonization of\r\nIgnatius Loyola in August, 1623, Luther is called _monstrum teterrimum\r\net detestabilis pestis_.\r\n\r\nCalvin was less tolerant, for he had no Melancthon! His adversaries are\r\nnever others than knaves, lunatics, drunkards and assassins! Sometimes\r\nthey are characterised by the familiar appellatives of bulls, asses,\r\ncats, and hogs! By him Catholic and Lutheran are alike hated. Yet, after\r\nhaving given vent to this virulent humour, he frequently boasts of his\r\nmildness. When he reads over his writings, he tells us, that he is\r\nastonished at his forbearance; but this, he adds, is the duty of every\r\nChristian! at the same time, he generally finishes a period with--\"Do\r\nyou hear, you dog?\" \"Do you hear, madman?\"\r\n\r\nBeza, the disciple of Calvin, sometimes imitates the luxuriant abuse of\r\nhis master. When he writes against Tillemont, a Lutheran minister, he\r\nbestows on him the following titles of honour:--\"Polyphemus; an ape; a\r\ngreat ass, who is distinguished from other asses by wearing a hat; an\r\nass on two feet; a monster composed of part of an ape and wild ass; a\r\nvillain who merits hanging on the first tree we find.\" And Beza was, no\r\ndoubt, desirous of the office of executioner!\r\n\r\nThe Catholic party is by no means inferior in the felicities of their\r\nstyle. The Jesuit Raynaud calls Erasmus the \"Batavian buffoon,\" and\r\naccuses him of nourishing the egg which Luther hatched. These men were\r\nalike supposed by their friends to be the inspired regulators of\r\nreligion![89]\r\n\r\nBishop Bedell, a great and good man, respected even by his adversaries,\r\nin an address to his clergy, observes, \"Our calling is to deal with\r\nerrors, not to disgrace the man with scolding words. It is said of\r\nAlexander, I think, when he overheard one of his soldiers railing\r\nlustily against Darius his enemy, that he reproved him, and added,\r\n\"Friend, I entertain thee to fight against Darius, not to revile him;\"\r\nand my sentiments of treating the Catholics,\" concludes Bedell, \"are\r\nnot conformable to the practice of Luther and Calvin; but they were but\r\nmen, and perhaps we must confess they suffered themselves to yield to\r\nthe violence of passion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fathers of the Church were proficients in the art of abuse, and very\r\ningeniously defended it. St. Austin affirms that the most caustic\r\npersonality may produce a wonderful effect, in opening a man's eyes to\r\nhis own follies. He illustrates his position with a story, given with\r\ngreat simplicity, of his mother Saint Monica with her maid. Saint Monica\r\ncertainly would have been a confirmed drunkard, had not her maid\r\ntimelily and outrageously abused her. The story will amuse.--\"My mother\r\nhad by little and little accustomed herself to relish wine. They used to\r\nsend her to the cellar, as being one of the soberest in the family: she\r\nfirst sipped from the jug and tasted a few drops, for she abhorred wine,\r\nand did not care to drink. However, she gradually accustomed herself,\r\nand from sipping it on her lips she swallowed a draught. As people from\r\nthe smallest faults insensibly increase, she at length liked wine, and\r\ndrank bumpers. But one day being alone with the maid who usually\r\nattended her to the cellar, they quarrelled, and the maid bitterly\r\nreproached her with being a _drunkard_! That _single word_ struck her so\r\npoignantly that it opened her understanding; and reflecting on the\r\ndeformity of the vice, she desisted for ever from its use.\"\r\n\r\nTo jeer and play the droll, or, in his own words, _de bouffonner_, was a\r\nmode of controversy the great Arnauld defended, as permitted by the\r\nwritings of the holy fathers. It is still more singular, when he not\r\nonly brings forward as an example of this ribaldry, Elijah _mocking_ at\r\nthe false divinities, but _God_ himself _bantering_ the first man after\r\nhis fall. He justifies the injurious epithets which he has so liberally\r\nbestowed on his adversaries by the example of Jesus Christ and the\r\napostles! It was on these grounds also that the celebrated Pascal\r\napologised for the invectives with which he has occasionally disfigured\r\nhis Provincial Letters. A Jesuit has collected \"An Alphabetical\r\nCatalogue of the Names of _Beasts_ by which the Fathers characterised\r\nthe Heretics!\" It may be found in _Erotemata de malis ac bonis Libris_,\r\np. 93, 4to. 1653, of Father Kaynaud. This list of brutes and insects,\r\namong which are a vast variety of serpents, is accompanied by the names\r\nof the heretics designated!\r\n\r\nHenry Fitzsermon, an Irish Jesuit, was imprisoned for his papistical\r\ndesigns and seditious preaching. During his confinement he proved\r\nhimself to be a great amateur of controversy. He said, \"he felt like a\r\n_bear_ tied to a stake, and wanted somebody to _bait_ him.\" A kind\r\noffice, zealously undertaken by the learned _Usher_, then a young man.\r\nHe _engaged to dispute_ with him _once a week_ on the subject of\r\n_antichrist_! They met several times. It appears that _our bear_ was\r\nout-worried, and declined any further _dog-baiting_. This spread an\r\nuniversal joy through the Protestants in Dublin. At the early period of\r\nthe Reformation, Dr. Smith of Oxford abjured papistry, with the hope of\r\nretaining his professorship, but it was given to Peter Martyr. On this\r\nour Doctor recants, and writes several controversial works against Peter\r\nMartyr; the most curious part of which is the singular mode adopted of\r\nattacking others, as well as Peter Martyr. In his margin he frequently\r\nbreaks out thus: \"Let Hooper read this!\"--\"Here, Ponet, open your eyes\r\nand see your errors!\"--\"Ergo, Cox, thou art damned!\" In this manner,\r\nwithout expressly writing against these persons, the stirring polemic\r\ncontrived to keep up a sharp bush-fighting in his margins. Such was the\r\nspirit of those times, very different from our own. When a modern bishop\r\nwas just advanced to a mitre, his bookseller begged to re-publish a\r\npopular theological tract of his against another bishop, because he\r\nmight now meet him on equal terms. My lord answered--\"Mr.----, no more\r\ncontroversy now!\" Our good bishop resembled Baldwin, who from a simple\r\nmonk, arrived to the honour of the see of Canterbury. The successive\r\nhonours successively changed his manners. Urban the Second inscribed his\r\nbrief to him in this concise description--_Balduino Monastico\r\nferventissimo, Abbati calido, Episcopo tepido, Archiepiscopo remisso_!\r\n\r\nOn the subject of literary controversies, we cannot pass over the\r\nvarious sects of the scholastics: a volume might be compiled of their\r\nferocious wars, which in more than one instance were accompanied by\r\nstones and daggers. The most memorable, on account of the extent, the\r\nviolence, and duration of their contests, are those of the NOMINALISTS\r\nand the REALISTS.\r\n\r\nIt was a most subtle question assuredly, and the world thought for a\r\nlong while that their happiness depended on deciding, whether\r\nuniversals, that is _genera_, have a real essence, and exist\r\nindependent of particulars, that is _species_:--whether, for instance,\r\nwe could form an idea of asses, prior to individual asses? Roscelinus,\r\nin the eleventh century, adopted the opinion that universals have no\r\nreal existence, either before or in individuals, but are mere names and\r\nwords by which the kind of individuals is expressed; a tenet propagated\r\nby Abelard, which produced the sect of _Nominalists_. But the _Realists_\r\nasserted that universals existed independent of individuals,--though\r\nthey were somewhat divided between the various opinions of Plato and\r\nAristotle. Of the Realists the most famous were Thomas Aquinas and Duns\r\nScotus. The cause of the Nominalists was almost desperate, till Occam in\r\nthe fourteenth century revived the dying embers. Louis XI. adopted the\r\nNominalists, and the Nominalists flourished at large in France and\r\nGermany; but unfortunately Pope John XXIII. patronised the Realists, and\r\nthroughout Italy it was dangerous for a Nominalist to open his lips. The\r\nFrench King wavered, and the Pope triumphed; his majesty published an\r\nedict in 1474, in which he silenced for ever the Nominalists, and\r\nordered their books to be fastened up in their libraries with iron\r\nchains, that they might not be read by young students! The leaders of\r\nthat sect fled into England and Germany, where they united their forces\r\nwith Luther and the first Reformers.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the violence with which these disputes were\r\nconducted. Vives himself, who witnessed the contests, says that, \"when\r\nthe contending parties had exhausted their stock of verbal abuse, they\r\noften came to blows; and it was not uncommon in these quarrels about\r\n_universals_, to see the combatants engaging not only with their fists,\r\nbut with clubs and swords, so that many have been wounded and some\r\nkilled.\"\r\n\r\nOn this war of words, and all this terrifying nonsense John of Salisbury\r\nobserves, \"that there had been more time consumed than the Cæsars had\r\nemployed in making themselves masters of the world; that the riches of\r\nCroesus were inferior to the treasures that had been exhausted in this\r\ncontroversy; and that the contending parties, after having spent their\r\nwhole lives in this single point, had neither been so happy as to\r\ndetermine it to their satisfaction, nor to find in the labyrinths of\r\nscience where they had been groping any discovery that was worth the\r\npains they had taken.\" It may be added that Ramus having attacked\r\nAristotle, for \"teaching us chimeras,\" all his scholars revolted; the\r\nparliament put a stop to his lectures, and at length having brought the\r\nmatter into a law court, he was declared \"to be insolent and\r\ndaring\"--the king proscribed his works, he was ridiculed on the stage,\r\nand hissed at by his scholars. When at length, during the plague, he\r\nopened again his schools, he drew on himself a fresh storm by reforming\r\nthe pronunciation of the letter Q, which they then pronounced like\r\nK--Kiskis for Quisquis, and Kamkam for Quamquam. This innovation Was\r\nonce more laid to his charge: a new rebellion! and a new ejection of the\r\nAnti-Aristotelian! The brother of that Gabriel Harvey who was the friend\r\nof Spenser, and with Gabriel had been the whetstone of the town-wits of\r\nhis time, distinguished himself by his wrath against the Stagyrite.\r\nAfter having with Gabriel predicted an earthquake, and alarmed the\r\nkingdom, which never took place (that is the earthquake, not the alarm),\r\nthe wits buffeted him. Nash says of him, that \"Tarlton at the theatre\r\nmade jests of him, and Elderton consumed his ale-crammed nose to\r\nnothing, in bear-baiting him with whole bundles of ballads.\" Marlow\r\ndeclared him to be \"an ass fit only to preach of the iron age.\" Stung to\r\nmadness by this lively nest of hornets, he avenged himself in a very\r\ncowardly manner--he attacked Aristotle himself! for he set _Aristotle_\r\nwith his _heels upwards_ on the school gates at Cambridge, and with\r\n_asses' ears_ on his head!\r\n\r\nBut this controversy concerning Aristotle and the school divinity was\r\neven prolonged. A professor in the College at Naples published in 1688\r\nfour volumes of peripatetic philosophy, to establish the principles of\r\nAristotle. The work was exploded, and he wrote an abusive treatise under\r\nthe _nom de guerre_ of Benedetto Aletino. A man of letters, Constantino\r\nGrimaldi, replied. Aletino rejoined; he wrote letters, an apology for\r\nthe letters, and would have written more for Aristotle than Aristotle\r\nhimself perhaps would have done. However, Grimaldi was no ordinary\r\nantagonist, and not to be outwearied. He had not only the best of the\r\nargument, but he was resolved to tell the world so, as long as the world\r\nwould listen. Whether he killed off Father Benedictus, the first author,\r\nis not affirmed; but the latter died during the controversy. Grimaldi,\r\nhowever, afterwards pursued his ghost, and buffeted the father in his\r\ngrave. This enraged the University of Naples; and the Jesuits, to a man,\r\ndenounced Grimaldi to Pope Benedict XIII. and to the Viceroy of Naples.\r\nOn this the Pope issued a bull prohibiting the reading of Grimaldi's\r\nworks, or keeping them, under pain of excommunication; and the viceroy,\r\nmore active than the bull, caused all the copies which were found in the\r\nauthor's house to be thrown _into the sea_! The author with tears in his\r\neyes beheld his expatriated volumes, hopeless that their voyage would\r\nhave been successful. However, all the little family of the Grimaldis\r\nwere not drowned--for a storm arose, and happily drove ashore many of\r\nthe floating copies, and these falling into charitable hands, the\r\nheretical opinions of poor Grimaldi against Aristotle and school\r\ndivinity were still read by those who were not out-terrified by the\r\nPope's bulls. The _salted_ passages were still at hand, and quoted with\r\na double zest against the Jesuits!\r\n\r\nWe now turn to writers whose controversy was kindled only by subjects of\r\npolite literature. The particulars form a curious picture of the taste\r\nof the age.\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" says Joseph Scaliger, that great critic and reviler, \"an art\r\nof abuse or slandering, of which those that are ignorant may be said to\r\ndefame others much less than they show a willingness to defame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Literary wars,\" says Bayle, \"are sometimes as lasting as they are\r\nterrible.\" A disputation between two great scholars was so interminably\r\nviolent, that it lasted thirty years! He humorously compares its\r\nduration to the German war which lasted as long.\r\n\r\nBaillet, when he refuted the sentiments of a certain author always did\r\nit without naming him; but when he found any observation which, he\r\ndeemed commendable, he quoted his name. Bayle observes, that \"this is an\r\nexcess of politeness, prejudicial to that freedom which should ever\r\nexist in the republic of letters; that it should be allowed always to\r\nname those whom we refute; and that it is sufficient for this purpose\r\nthat we banish asperity, malice, and indecency.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these preliminary observations, I shall bring forward various\r\nexamples where this excellent advice is by no means regarded.\r\n\r\nErasmus produced a dialogue, in which he ridiculed those scholars who\r\nwere servile imitators of Cicero; so servile, that they would employ no\r\nexpression but what was found in the works of that writer; everything\r\nwith them was Ciceronianised. This dialogue is written with great\r\nhumour. Julius Cæsar Scaliger, the father, who was then unknown to the\r\nworld, had been long looking for some occasion to distinguish himself;\r\nhe now wrote a defence of Cicero, but which in fact was one continued\r\ninvective against Erasmus: he there treats the latter as illiterate, a\r\ndrunkard, an impostor, an apostate, a hangman, a demon hot from hell!\r\nThe same Scaliger, acting on the same principle of distinguishing\r\nhimself at the cost of others, attacked Cardan's best work _De\r\nSubtilitate_: his criticism did not appear till seven years after the\r\nfirst edition of the work, and then he obstinately stuck to that\r\nedition, though Cardan had corrected it in subsequent ones; but this\r\nScaliger chose, that he might have a wider field for his attack. After\r\nthis, a rumour spread that Cardan had died of vexation from Julius\r\nCæsar's invincible pen; then Scaliger pretended to feel all the regret\r\npossible for a man he had killed, and whom he now praised: however, his\r\nregret had as little foundation as his triumph; for Cardan outlived\r\nScaliger many years, and valued his criticisms too cheaply to have\r\nsuffered them to have disturbed his quiet. All this does not exceed the\r\n_Invectives_ of Poggius, who has thus entitled several literary libels\r\ncomposed against some of his adversaries, Laurentius Valla, Philelphus,\r\n&c., who returned the poisoned chalice to his own lips; declamations of\r\nscurrility, obscenity, and calumny!\r\n\r\nScioppius was a worthy successor of the Scaligers: his favourite\r\nexpression was, that he had trodden down his adversary.\r\n\r\nScioppius was a critic, as skilful as Salmasius or Scaliger, but still\r\nmore learned in the language of abuse. This cynic was the Attila of\r\nauthors. He boasted that he had occasioned the deaths of Casaubon and\r\nScaliger. Detested and dreaded as the public scourge, Scioppius, at the\r\nclose of his life, was fearful he should find no retreat in which he\r\nmight be secure.\r\n\r\nThe great Casaubon employs the dialect of St. Giles's in his furious\r\nattacks on the learned Dalechamps, the Latin translator of Athenæus. To\r\nthis great physician he stood more deeply indebted than he chose to\r\nconfess; and to conceal the claims of this literary creditor, he called\r\nout _Vesanum!_ _Insanum!_ _Tiresiam!_ &c. It was the fashion of that day\r\nwith the ferocious heroes of the literary republic, to overwhelm each\r\nother with invectives, and to consider that their own grandeur\r\nconsisted in the magnitude of their volumes; and their triumphs in\r\nreducing their brother giants into puny dwarfs. In science, Linnæus had\r\na dread of controversy--conqueror or conquered we cannot escape without\r\ndisgrace! Mathiolus would have been the great man of his day, had he not\r\nmeddled with such matters. Who is gratified by \"the mad Cornarus,\" or\r\n\"the flayed Fox?\" titles which Fuchsius and Cornarus, two eminent\r\nbotanists, have bestowed on each other. Some who were too fond of\r\ncontroversy, as they grew wiser, have refused to take up the gauntlet.\r\n\r\nThe heat and acrimony of verbal critics have exceeded description. Their\r\nstigmas and anathemas have been long known to bear no proportion to the\r\noffences against which they have been directed. \"God confound you,\"\r\ncried one grammarian to another, \"for your theory of impersonal verbs!\"\r\nThere was a long and terrible controversy formerly, whether the\r\nFlorentine dialect was to prevail over the others. The academy was put\r\nto great trouble, and the Anti-Cruscans were often on the point of\r\nannulling this supremacy; _una mordace scritura_ was applied to one of\r\nthese literary canons; and in a letter of those times the following\r\nparagraph appears:--\"Pescetti is preparing to give a second answer to\r\nBeni, which will not please him; I now believe the prophecy of Cavalier\r\nTedeschi will be verified, and that this controversy, begun with pens,\r\nwill end with poniards!\"\r\n\r\nFabretti, an Italian, wrote furiously against Gronovius, whom he calls\r\n_Grunnovius_: he compared him to all those animals whose voice was\r\nexpressed by the word _Grunnire, to grunt_. Gronovius was so malevolent\r\na critic, that he was distinguished by the title of the \"Grammatical\r\nCur.\"\r\n\r\nWhen critics venture to attack the person as well as the performance of\r\nan author, I recommend the salutary proceedings of Huberus, the writer\r\nof an esteemed Universal History. He had been so roughly handled by\r\nPerizonius, that he obliged him to make the _amende honorable_ in a\r\ncourt of justice; where, however, I fear an English jury would give the\r\nsmallest damages.\r\n\r\nCertain authors may be distinguished by the title of LITERARY BOBADILS,\r\nor fighting authors. One of our own celebrated writers drew his sword on\r\na reviewer; and another, when his farce was condemned, offered to fight\r\nany one of the audience who hissed. Scudery, brother of the celebrated\r\nMademoiselle Scudery, was a true Parnassian bully. The first\r\npublication which brought him into notice was his edition of the works\r\nof his friend Theophile. He concludes the preface with these singular\r\nexpressions--\"I do not hesitate to declare, that, amongst all the dead,\r\nand all the living, there is no person who has anything to show that\r\napproaches the force of this vigorous genius; but if amongst the latter,\r\nany one were so extravagant as to consider that I detract from his\r\nimaginary glory, to show him that I fear as little as I esteem him, this\r\nis to inform him that my name is\r\n                                                    \"DE SCUDERY.\"\r\n\r\nA similar rhodomontade is that of Claude Trellon, a poetical soldier,\r\nwho begins his poems by challenging the critics, assuring them that if\r\nany one attempts to censure him, he will only condescend to answer sword\r\nin hand. Father Macedo, a Portuguese Jesuit, having written against\r\nCardinal Noris, on the monkery of St. Austin, it was deemed necessary to\r\nsilence both parties. Macedo, compelled to relinquish the pen, sent his\r\nadversary a challenge, and according to the laws of chivalry, appointed\r\na place for meeting in the wood of Boulogne. Another edict forbad the\r\nduel! Macedo then murmured at his hard fate, which would not suffer him,\r\nfor the sake of St. Austin, for whom he had a particular regard, to\r\nspill either his _ink_ or his _blood_.\r\n\r\nANTI, prefixed to the name of the person attacked, was once a favourite\r\ntitle to books of literary controversy. With a critical review of such\r\nbooks Baillet has filled a quarto volume; yet such was the abundant\r\nharvest, that he left considerable gleanings for posterior industry.\r\n\r\nAnti-Gronovius was a book published against Gronovius, by Kuster.\r\nPerizonius, another pugilist of literature, entered into this dispute on\r\nthe subject of the Æs grave of the ancients, to which Kuster had just\r\nadverted at the close of his volume. What was the consequence?\r\nDreadful!--Answers and rejoinders from both, in which they bespattered\r\neach other with the foulest abuse. A journalist pleasantly blames this\r\nacrimonious controversy. He says, \"To read the pamphlets of a Perizonius\r\nand a Kuster on the Æs grave of the ancients, who would not renounce all\r\ncommerce with antiquity? It seems as if an Agamemnon and an Achilles\r\nwere railing at each other. Who can refrain from laughter, when one of\r\nthese commentators even points his attacks at the very name of his\r\nadversary? According to Kuster, the name of Perizonius signifies a\r\n_certain part_ of the human body. How is it possible, that with such a\r\nname he could be right concerning the Æs grave? But does that of Kuster\r\npromise a better thing, since it signifies a beadle; a man who drives\r\ndogs out of churches?--What madness is this!\"\r\n\r\nCorneille, like our Dryden, felt the acrimony of literary irritation. To\r\nthe critical strictures of D'Aubignac it is acknowledged he paid the\r\ngreatest attention, for, after this critic's _Pratique du Théâtre_\r\nappeared, his tragedies were more artfully conducted. But instead of\r\nmentioning the critic with due praise, he preserved an ungrateful\r\nsilence. This occasioned a quarrel between the poet and the critic, in\r\nwhich the former exhaled his bile in several abusive epigrams, which\r\nhave, fortunately for his credit, not been preserved in his works.\r\n\r\nThe lively Voltaire could not resist the charm of abusing his\r\nadversaries. We may smile when he calls a blockhead, a blockhead; a\r\ndotard, a dotard; but when he attacks, for a difference of opinion, the\r\n_morals_ of another man, our sensibility is alarmed. A higher tribunal\r\nthan that of criticism is to decide on the _actions_ of men.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain disguised malice, which some writers have most\r\nunfairly employed in characterising a contemporary. Burnet called Prior,\r\n_one Prior_. In Bishop Parker's History of his Own Times, an innocent\r\nreader may start at seeing the celebrated Marvell described as an\r\noutcast of society; an infamous libeller; and one whose talents were\r\neven more despicable than his person. To such lengths did the hatred of\r\nparty, united with personal rancour, carry this bishop, who was himself\r\nthe worst of time-servers. He was, however, amply paid by the keen wit\r\nof Marvell in \"The Rehearsal Transposed,\" which may still be read with\r\ndelight, as an admirable effusion of banter, wit, and satire. Le Clerc,\r\na cool ponderous Greek critic, quarrelled with Boileau about a passage\r\nin Longinus, and several years afterwards, in revising Moreri's\r\nDictionary, gave a short sarcastic notice of the poet's brother; in\r\nwhich he calls him the elder brother of _him who has written the book\r\nentitled, \"Satires of Mr. Boileau Despréaux_!\"--the works of the modern\r\nHorace, which were then delighting Europe, he calls, with simple\r\nimpudence, \"a book entitled Satires!\"\r\n\r\nThe works of Homer produced a controversy, both long and virulent,\r\namongst the wits of France. This literary quarrel is of some note in\r\nthe annals of literature, since it has produced two valuable books; La\r\nMotte's \"Réflexions sur la Critique,\" and Madame Dacier's \"Des Causes de\r\nla Corruption du Goût.\" La Motte wrote with feminine delicacy, and\r\nMadame Dacier like a University pedant. \"At length, by the efforts of\r\nValincour, the friend of art, of artists, and of peace, the contest was\r\nterminated.\" Both parties were formidable in number, and to each he made\r\nremonstrances, and applied reproaches. La Motte and Madame Dacier, the\r\nopposite leaders, were convinced by his arguments, made reciprocal\r\nconcessions, and concluded a peace. The treaty was formally ratified at\r\na dinner, given on the occasion by a Madame De Staël, who represented\r\n\"Neutrality.\" Libations were poured to the memory of old Homer, and the\r\nparties were reconciled.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Caricaturists were employed on both sides of the question,\r\nand by pictures as well as words the war of polemics was vigorously\r\ncarried on. In one instance, the head of Luther is represented as the\r\nDevil's Bagpipe; he blows into his ear, and uses his nose as a chanter.\r\nCocleus, in one of his tracts, represents Luther as a monster with seven\r\nheads, indicative of his follies; the first is that of a disputatious\r\ndoctor, the last that of Barabbas! Luther replied in other pamphlets,\r\nadorned with equally gross delineations levelled at his opponents.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Bishop Percy's _Reliques of Ancient English Poetry_ will\r\nfurnish an example of the coarseness of invective used by both parties\r\nduring the era of the Reformation; in such rhymes as \"Plain Truth and\r\nBlind Ignorance\"--\"A Ballad of Luther and the Pope,\" &c. The old\r\ninterlude of \"Newe Custome,\" printed in Dodsley's _Old Plays_; and that\r\nof \"Lusty Juventus,\" in Hawkins's _English Drama_, are choice specimens\r\nof the vulgarest abuse. Bishop Bale in his play of _King John_\r\n(published in 1838 by the Camden Society), indulges in a levity and\r\ncoarseness that would not now be tolerated in an alehouse--\"stynkyng\r\nheretic\" on one side, and \"vile popysh swyne\" on the other, are among\r\nthe mildest epithets used in these religious satires. One of the most\r\ncurious is a dialogue between John Bon, a husbandman, and \"Master\r\nParson\" of his parish, on the subject of transubstantiation; it was so\r\nviolent in its style as to threaten great trouble to author and printer\r\n(see Strype's _Ecclesiastical Memorials_). It may be seen in vol. xxx.\r\nof the Percy Society's publications.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY BLUNDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dante published his \"Inferno,\" the simplicity of the age accepted\r\nit as a true narrative of his descent into hell.\r\n\r\nWhen the Utopia of Sir Thomas More was first published, it occasioned a\r\npleasant mistake. This political romance represents a perfect, but\r\nvisionary republic, in an island supposed to have been newly discovered\r\nin America. \"As this was the age of discovery,\" says Granger, \"the\r\nlearned Budæus, and others, took it for a genuine history; and\r\nconsidered it as highly expedient, that missionaries should be sent\r\nthither, in order to convert so wise a nation to Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a long while after publication that many readers were convinced\r\nthat Gulliver's Travels were fictitious.[90]\r\n\r\nBut the most singular blunder was produced by the ingenious \"Hermippus\r\nRedivivus\" of Dr. Campbell, a curious banter on the hermetic philosophy,\r\nand the universal medicine; but the grave irony is so closely kept up,\r\nthat it deceived for a length of time the most learned. His notion of\r\nthe art of prolonging life, by inhaling the breath of young women, was\r\neagerly credited. A physician, who himself had composed a treatise on\r\nhealth, was so influenced by it, that he actually took lodgings at a\r\nfemale boarding-school, that he might never be without a constant supply\r\nof the breath of young ladies. Mr. Thicknesse seriously adopted the\r\nproject. Dr. Kippis acknowledged that after he had read the work in his\r\nyouth, the reasonings and the facts left him several days in a kind of\r\nfairy land. I have a copy with manuscript notes by a learned physician,\r\nwho seems to have had no doubts of its veracity. After all, the\r\nintention of the work was long doubtful; till Dr. Campbell assured a\r\nfriend it was a mere jeu-d'esprit; that Bayle was considered as standing\r\nwithout a rival in the art of treating at large a difficult subject,\r\nwithout discovering to which side his own sentiments leaned: Campbell\r\nhad read more uncommon books than most men, and wished to rival Bayle,\r\nand at the same time to give many curious matters little known.\r\n\r\nPalavicini, in his History of the Council of Trent, to confer an honour\r\non M. Lansac, ambassador of Charles IX. to that council, bestows on him\r\na collar of the order of Saint Esprit; but which order was not\r\ninstituted till several years afterwards by Henry III. A similar\r\nvoluntary blunder is that of Surita, in his _Annales de la Corona de\r\nAragon_. This writer represents, in the battles he describes, many\r\npersons who were not present; and this, merely to confer honour on some\r\nparticular families.\r\n\r\nFabiana, quoting a French narrative of travels in Italy, took for the\r\nname of the author the words, found at the end of the title-page,\r\n_Enrichi de deux Listes_; that is, \"Enriched with two lists:\" on this he\r\nobserves, \"that Mr. Enriched with two lists has not failed to do that\r\njustice to Ciampini which he merited.\"[91] The abridgers of Gesner's\r\nBibliotheca ascribe the romance of Amadis to one _Acuerdo Olvido_;\r\nRemembrance, Oblivion; mistaking the French translator's Spanish motto\r\non the title-page for the name of the author.\r\n\r\nD'Aquin, the French king's physician, in his Memoir on the Preparation\r\nof Bark, takes _Mantissa_, which is the title of the Appendix to the\r\nHistory of Plants, by Johnstone, for the name of an author, and who, he\r\nsays, is so extremely rare, that he only knows him by name.\r\n\r\nLord Bolingbroke imagined, that in those famous verses, beginning with\r\n_Excudent alii_, &c., Virgil attributed to the Romans the glory of\r\nhaving surpassed the Greeks in historical composition: according to his\r\nidea, those Roman historians whom Virgil preferred to the Grecians were\r\nSallust, Livy, and Tacitus. But Virgil died before Livy had written his\r\nhistory, or Tacitus was born.\r\n\r\nAn honest friar, who compiled a church history, has placed in the class\r\nof ecclesiastical writers Guarini, the Italian poet, on the faith of the\r\ntitle of his celebrated amorous pastoral, _Il Pastor Fido_, \"The\r\nFaithful Shepherd;\" our good father imagined that the character of a\r\ncurate, vicar, or bishop, was represented in this work.\r\n\r\nA blunder has been recorded of the monks in the dark ages, which was\r\nlikely enough to happen when their ignorance was so dense. A rector of a\r\nparish going to law with his parishioners about paving the church,\r\nquoted this authority from St. Peter--_Paveant illi, non paveam ego_;\r\nwhich he construed, _They are to pave the church, not I_. This was\r\nallowed to be good law by a judge, himself an ecclesiastic too.\r\n\r\nOne of the grossest literary blunders of modern times is that of the\r\nlate Gilbert Wakefield, in his edition of Pope. He there takes the\r\nwell-known \"Song by a Person of Quality,\" which is a piece of ridicule\r\non the glittering tuneful nonsense of certain poets, as a serious\r\ncomposition. In a most copious commentary, he proves that every line\r\nseems unconnected with its brothers, and that the whole reflects\r\ndisgrace on its author! A circumstance which too evidently shows how\r\nnecessary the knowledge of modern literary history is to a modern\r\ncommentator, and that those who are profound in verbal Greek are not the\r\nbest critics on English writers.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Bizot, the author of the medallic history of Holland, fell into\r\na droll mistake. There is a medal, struck when Philip II. set forth his\r\n_invincible Armada_, on which are represented the King of Spain, the\r\nEmperor, the Pope, Electors, Cardinals, &c., with their eyes covered\r\nwith a bandage, and bearing for inscription this fine verse of\r\nLucretius:--\r\n\r\n    O cæcas hominum menteis! O pectora cæca!\r\n\r\nThe Abbé, prepossessed with the prejudice that a nation persecuted by\r\nthe Pope and his adherents could not represent them without some insult,\r\ndid not examine with sufficient care the ends of the bandages which\r\ncovered the eyes and waved about the heads of the personages represented\r\non this medal: he rashly took them for _asses' ears_, and as such they\r\nare engraved!\r\n\r\nMabillon has preserved a curious literary blunder of some pious\r\nSpaniards, who applied to the Pope for consecrating a day in honour of\r\n_Saint Viar_. His holiness, in the voluminous catalogue of his saints,\r\nwas ignorant of this one. The only proof brought forward for his\r\nexistence was this inscription:--\r\n\r\n    S. VIAR.\r\n\r\nAn antiquary, however, hindered one more festival in the Catholic\r\ncalendar, by convincing them that these letters were only the remains of\r\nan inscription erected for an ancient surveyor of the roads; and he read\r\ntheir saintship thus:--\r\n\r\n    PRÆFECTUS VIARUM.\r\n\r\nMaffei, in his comparison between Medals and Inscriptions, detects a\r\nliterary blunder in Spon, who, meeting with this inscription,\r\n\r\n    Maximo VI Consule\r\n\r\ntakes the letters VI for numerals, which occasions a strange\r\nanachronism. They are only contractions of _Viro Illustri_--V I.\r\n\r\nAs absurd a blunder was this of Dr. Stukeley on the coins of Carausius;\r\nfinding a battered one with a defaced inscription of\r\n\r\n    FORTVNA AVG.\r\n\r\nhe read it\r\n\r\n    ORIVNA AVG.\r\n\r\nAnd sagaciously interpreting this to be the _wife_ of Carausius, makes\r\na new personage start up in history; he contrives even to give some\r\n_theoretical Memoirs_ of the _August Oriuna_.[92]\r\n\r\nFather Sirmond was of opinion that St. Ursula and her eleven thousand\r\nVirgins were all created out of a blunder. In some ancient MS. they\r\nfound _St. Ursula et Undecimilla V. M._ meaning St. Ursula and\r\n_Undecimilla_, Virgin Martyrs; imagining that _Undecimilla_ with the\r\n_V._ and _M._ which followed, was an abbreviation for _Undecem Millia\r\nMartyrum Virginum_, they made out of _Two Virgins_ the whole _Eleven\r\nThousand_!\r\n\r\nPope, in a note on Measure for Measure, informs us, that its story was\r\ntaken from Cinthio's Novels, _Dec._ 8. _Nov._ 5. That is, _Decade 8,\r\nNovel 5._ The critical Warburton, in his edition of Shakspeare, puts the\r\nwords in full length thus, _December_ 8, _November 5._\r\n\r\nWhen the fragments of Petronius made a great noise in the literary\r\nworld, Meibomius, an erudit of Lubeck, read in a letter from another\r\nlearned scholar from Bologna, \"We have here _an entire Petronius_; I saw\r\nit with mine own eyes, and with admiration.\" Meibomius in post-haste is\r\non the road, arrives at Bologna, and immediately inquires for the\r\nlibrarian Capponi. He inquires if it were true that they had at Bologna\r\n_an entire Petronius_? Capponi assures him that it was a thing which had\r\nlong been public. \"Can I see this Petronius? Let me examine\r\nit!\"--\"Certainly,\" replies Capponi, and leads our erudit of Lubeck to\r\nthe church where reposes _the body of St. Petronius_. Meibomius bites\r\nhis lips, calls for his chaise, and takes his flight.\r\n\r\nA French translator, when he came to a passage of Swift, in which it is\r\nsaid that the Duke of Marlborough _broke_ an officer; not being\r\nacquainted with this Anglicism, he translated it _roué_, broke on a\r\nwheel!\r\n\r\nCibber's play of \"_Love's Last Shift_\" was entitled \"_La Dernière\r\nChemise de l'Amour_.\" A French writer of Congreve's life has taken his\r\n_Mourning_ for a _Morning_ Bride, and translated it _L'Espouse du\r\nMatin_.\r\n\r\nSir John Pringle mentions his having cured a soldier by the use of two\r\nquarts of _Dog and Duck water_ daily: a French translator specifies it\r\nas an excellent _broth_ made of a duck and a dog! In a recent catalogue\r\ncompiled by a French writer of _Works on Natural History_, he has\r\ninserted the well-known \"Essay on _Irish Bulls_\" by the Edgeworths. The\r\nproof, if it required any, that a Frenchman cannot understand the\r\nidiomatic style of Shakspeare appears in a French translator, who prided\r\nhimself on giving a verbal translation of our great poet, not approving\r\nof Le Tourneur's paraphrastical version. He found in the celebrated\r\nspeech of Northumberland in Henry IV.\r\n\r\n    Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,\r\n    So dull, so dead in look, so _woe-begone_--\r\n\r\nwhich he renders \"_Ainsi douleur! va-t'en!\"_\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Gregoire affords another striking proof of the errors to which\r\nforeigners are liable when they decide on the _language_ and _customs_\r\nof another country. The Abbé, in the excess of his philanthropy, to show\r\nto what dishonourable offices human nature is degraded, acquaints us\r\nthat at London he observed a sign-board, proclaiming the master as\r\n_tueur des punaises de sa majesté_! Bug-destroyer to his majesty! This\r\nis, no doubt, the honest Mr. Tiffin, in the Strand; and the idea which\r\nmust have occurred to the good Abbé was, that his majesty's bugs were\r\nhunted by the said destroyer, and taken by hand--and thus human nature\r\nwas degraded!\r\n\r\nA French writer translates the Latin title of a treatise of Philo-Judæus\r\n_Omnis bonus liber est_, Every good man is a free man, by _Tout livre\r\nest bon_. It was well for him, observes Jortin, that he did not live\r\nwithin the reach of the Inquisition, which might have taken this as a\r\nreflection on the _Index Expurgatorius_.\r\n\r\nAn English translator turned \"Dieu _défend_ l'adultère\" into \"God\r\n_defends_ adultery.\"--Guthrie, in his translation of Du Halde, has \"the\r\ntwenty-sixth day of the _new_ moon.\" The whole age of the moon is but\r\ntwenty-eight days. The blunder arose from his mistaking the word\r\n_neuvième_ (ninth) for _nouvelle_ or _neuve_ (new).\r\n\r\nThe facetious Tom Brown committed a strange blunder in his translation\r\nof Gelli's Circe. The word _Starne_, not aware of its signification, he\r\nboldly rendered _stares_, probably from the similitude of sound; the\r\nsucceeding translator more correctly discovered _Starne_ to be\r\nred-legged partridges!\r\n\r\nIn Charles II.'s reign a new collect was drawn, in which a new epithet\r\nwas added to the king's title, that gave great offence, and occasioned\r\ngreat raillery. He was styled _our most religious king_. Whatever the\r\nsignification of _religious_ might be in the _Latin_ word, as importing\r\nthe sacredness of the king's person, yet in the _English language_ it\r\nbore a signification that was no way applicable to the king. And he was\r\nasked by his familiar courtiers, what must the nation think when they\r\nheard him prayed for as their _most religious king_?--Literary blunders\r\nof this nature are frequently discovered in the versions of good\r\nclassical scholars, who would make the _English_ servilely bend to the\r\nLatin and Greek. Even Milton has been justly censured for his free use\r\nof Latinisms and Grecisms.\r\n\r\nThe blunders of modern antiquaries on sepulchral monuments are numerous.\r\nOne mistakes _a lion_ at a knight's feet for a _curled water dog_;\r\nanother could not distinguish _censers_ in the hands of angels from\r\n_fishing-nets_; _two angels_ at a lady's feet were counted as her two\r\ncherub-like _babes_; and another has mistaken a _leopard_ and a\r\n_hedgehog_ for a _cat_ and a _rat!_ In some of these cases, are the\r\nantiquaries or the sculptors most to be blamed?[93]\r\n\r\nA literary blunder of Thomas Warton is a specimen of the manner in which\r\na man of genius may continue to blunder with infinite ingenuity. In an\r\nold romance he finds these lines, describing the duel of Saladin with\r\nRichard Coeur de Lion:--\r\n\r\n    A _Faucon brode_ in hande he bare,\r\n    For he thought he wolde thare\r\n    Have slayne Richard.\r\n\r\nHe imagines this _Faucon brode_ means a _falcon bird_, or a hawk, and\r\nthat Saladin is represented with this bird on his fist to express his\r\ncontempt of his adversary. He supports his conjecture by noticing a\r\nGothic picture, supposed to be the subject of this duel, and also some\r\nold tapestry of heroes on horseback with hawks on their fists; he\r\nplunges into feudal times, when no gentleman appeared on horseback\r\nwithout his hawk. After all this curious erudition, the rough but\r\nskilful Ritson inhumanly triumphed by dissolving the magical fancies of\r\nthe more elegant Warton, by explaining a _Faucon brode_ to be nothing\r\nmore than a _broad faulchion_, which, in a duel, was certainly more\r\nuseful than a _bird_. The editor of the private reprint of Hentzner, on\r\nthat writer's tradition respecting \"the Kings of Denmark who reigned in\r\nEngland\" buried in the Temple Church, metamorphosed the two Inns of\r\nCourt, _Gray's Inn_ and _Lincoln's Inn_, into the names of the Danish\r\nkings, _Gresin_ and _Lyconin_.[94]\r\n\r\nBayle supposes that Marcellus Palingenius, who wrote the poem entitled\r\nthe _Zodiac_, the twelve books bearing the names of the signs, from this\r\ncircumstance assumed the title of _Poeta Stellatus_. But it appears that\r\nthis writer was an Italian and a native of _Stellada_, a town in the\r\nFerrarese. It is probable that his birthplace originally produced the\r\nconceit of the title of his poem: it is a curious instance how critical\r\nconjecture may be led astray by its own ingenuity, when ignorant of the\r\nreal fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: The first edition had all the external appearance of\r\ntruth: a portrait of \"Captain Lemuel Gulliver, of Redriff, aetat. suæ\r\nlviii.\" faces the title; and maps of all the places, he only, visited,\r\nare carefully laid down in connexion with the realities of geography.\r\nThus \"Lilliput, discovered A.D. 1699,\" lies between Sumatra and Van\r\nDieman's Land. \"Brobdignag, discovered A.D. 1703,\" is a peninsula of\r\nNorth America. One Richard Sympson vouches for the veracity of his\r\n\"antient and intimate friend,\" in a Preface detailing some \"facts\" of\r\nGulliver's Life. Arbuthnot says he \"lent the book to an old gentleman,\r\nwho went immediately to his map to search for Lilliput.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: In Nagler's _Kunstler-Lexicon_ is a whimsical error\r\nconcerning a living English artist--George Cruikshank. Some years ago\r\nthe relative merits of himself and brother were contrasted in an English\r\nreview, and George was spoken of as \"The real Simon Pure\"--the first who\r\nhad illustrated scenes of \"Life in London.\" Unaware of the real\r\nsignificance of a quotation which has become proverbial among us, the\r\nGerman editor begins his Memoir of Cruikshank, by gravely informing us\r\nthat he is an English artist, \"whose real name is Simon Pure!\" Turning\r\nto the artists under the letter P, we accordingly read:--\"PURE (Simon),\r\nthe real name of the celebrated caricaturist, George Cruikshank.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: The whole of Dr. Stukeley's tract is a most curious\r\ninstance of learned perversity and obstinacy. The coin is broken away\r\nwhere the letter F should be, and Stukeley himself allows that the upper\r\npart of the T might be worn away, and so the inscription really be\r\n_Fortuna Aug_; but he cast all such evidence aside, to construct an\r\nimaginary life of an imaginary empress; \"that we have no history of this\r\nlady,\" he says, \"is not to be wondered at,\" and he forthwith imagines\r\none; that she was of a martial disposition, and \"signalized herself in\r\nbattle, and obtained a victory,\" as he guesses from the laurel wreath\r\naround her bust on the coin; her name he believes to be Gaulish, and\r\n\"equivalent to what we now call Lucia,\" and that a regiment of soldiers\r\nwas under her command, after the fashion of \"the present Czarina,\" the\r\ncelebrated Catherine of Russia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: One of the most curious pictorial and antiquarian blunders\r\nmay be seen in Vallancey's _Collectanea_. He found upon one of the\r\nancient stones on the Hill of Tara an inscription which he read _Beli\r\nDivose_, \"to Belus, God of Fire;\" but which ultimately proved to be the\r\nwork of some idler who, lying on the stone, cut upside down his name and\r\nthe date of the year, E. Conid, 1731; upon turning this engraving, the\r\nfact is apparent.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITERARY WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Marriage is such a rabble rout;\r\n    That those that are out, would fain get in;\r\n    And those that are in, would fain get out.\r\n\r\n                                      CHAUCER.\r\n\r\nHaving examined some _literary blunders_, we will now proceed to the\r\nsubject of a _literary wife_, which may happen to prove one. A learned\r\nlady is to the taste of few. It is however matter of surprise, that\r\nseveral literary men should have felt such a want of taste in respect to\r\n\"their soul's far dearer part,\" as Hector calls his Andromache. The\r\nwives of many men of letters have been dissolute, ill-humoured,\r\nslatternly, and have run into all the frivolities of the age. The wife\r\nof the learned Budæus was of a different character.\r\n\r\nHow delightful is it when the mind of the female is so happily disposed,\r\nand so richly cultivated, as to participate in the literary avocations\r\nof her husband! It is then truly that the intercourse of the sexes\r\nbecomes the most refined pleasure. What delight, for instance, must the\r\ngreat Budæus have tasted, even in those works which must have been for\r\nothers a most dreadful labour! His wife left him nothing to desire. The\r\nfrequent companion of his studies, she brought him the books he required\r\nto his desk; she collated passages, and transcribed quotations; the same\r\ngenius, the same inclination, and the same ardour for literature,\r\neminently appeared in those two fortunate persons. Far from withdrawing\r\nher husband from his studies, she was sedulous to animate him when he\r\nlanguished. Ever at his side, and ever assiduous; ever with some useful\r\nbook in her hand, she acknowledged herself to be a most happy woman. Yet\r\nshe did not neglect the education of eleven children. She and Budæus\r\nshared in the mutual cares they owed their progeny. Budæus was not\r\ninsensible of his singular felicity. In one of his letters, he\r\nrepresents himself as married to two _ladies_; one of whom gave him boys\r\nand girls, the other was Philosophy, who produced books. He says that in\r\nhis twelve first years, Philosophy had been less fruitful than marriage;\r\nhe had produced less books than children; he had laboured more\r\ncorporally than intellectually; but he hoped to make more books than\r\nmen. \"The soul (says he) will be productive in its turn; it will rise on\r\nthe ruins of the body; a prolific virtue is not given at the same time\r\nto the bodily organs and the pen.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady of Evelyn designed herself the frontispiece to his translation\r\nof Lucretius. She felt the same passion in her own breast which animated\r\nher husband's, who has written, with such various ingenuity. Of Baron\r\nHaller it is recorded that he inspired his wife and family with a taste\r\nfor his different pursuits. They were usually employed in assisting his\r\nliterary occupations; they transcribed manuscripts, consulted authors,\r\ngathered plants, and designed and coloured under his eye. What a\r\ndelightful family picture has the younger Pliny given posterity in his\r\nletters! Of Calphurnia, his wife, he says, \"Her affection to me has\r\ngiven her a turn to books; and my compositions, which she takes a\r\npleasure in reading, and even getting by heart, are continually in her\r\nhands. How full of tender solicitude is she when I am entering upon any\r\ncause! How kindly does she rejoice with me when it is over! While I am\r\npleading, she places persons to inform her from time to time how I am\r\nheard, what applauses I receive, and what success attends the cause.\r\nWhen at any time I recite my works, she conceals herself behind some\r\ncurtain, and with secret rapture enjoys my praises. She sings my verses\r\nto her lyre, with no other master but love, the best instructor, for her\r\nguide. Her passion will increase with our days, for it is not my youth\r\nnor my person, which time gradually impairs, but my reputation and my\r\nglory, of which, she is enamoured.\"\r\n\r\nOn the subject of a literary wife, I must introduce to the acquaintance\r\nof the reader Margaret Duchess of Newcastle. She is known, at least by\r\nher name, as a voluminous writer; for she extended her literary\r\nproductions to the number of twelve folio volumes.\r\n\r\nHer labours have been ridiculed by some wits; but had her studies been\r\nregulated, she would have displayed no ordinary genius. The\r\n_Connoisseur_ has quoted her poems, and her verses have been imitated by\r\nMilton.\r\n\r\nThe duke, her husband, was also an author; his book on horsemanship\r\nstill preserves his name. He has likewise written comedies, and his\r\ncontemporaries have not been, penurious in their eulogiums. It is true\r\nhe was a duke. Shadwell says of him, \"That he was the greatest master of\r\nwit, the most exact observer of mankind, and the most accurate judge of\r\nhumour that ever he knew.\" The life of the duke is written \"by the hand\r\nof his incomparable duchess.\" It was published in his lifetime. This\r\ncurious piece of biography is a folio of 197 pages, and is entitled \"The\r\nLife of the Thrice Noble, High, and Puissant Prince, William Cavendish.\"\r\nHis titles then follow:--\"Written by the Thrice Noble, Illustrious, and\r\nExcellent Princess, Margaret Duchess of Newcastle, his wife. London,\r\n1667.\" This Life is dedicated to Charles the Second; and there is also\r\nprefixed a copious epistle to her husband the duke.\r\n\r\nIn this epistle the character of our Literary Wife is described with all\r\nits peculiarities.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, my lord, you have had as many enemies and as many friends as\r\never any one particular person had; nor do I so much wonder at it,\r\nsince I, a woman, cannot be exempt from the malice and aspersions of\r\nspiteful tongues, which they cast upon my poor writings, some denying me\r\nto be the true authoress of them; for your grace remembers well, that\r\nthose books I put out first to the judgment of this censorious age were\r\naccounted not to be written by a woman, but that somebody else had writ\r\nand published them in my name; by which your lordship was moved to\r\nprefix an epistle before one of them in my vindication, wherein you\r\nassure the world, upon your honour, that what was written and printed in\r\nmy name was my own; and I have also made known that your lordship was my\r\nonly tutor, in declaring to me what you had found and observed by your\r\nown experience; for I being young when your lordship married me, could\r\nnot have much knowledge of the world; but it pleased God to command his\r\nservant Nature to endue me with a poetical and philosophical genius,\r\neven from my birth; for I did write some books in that kind before I was\r\ntwelve years of age, which for want of good method and order I would\r\nnever divulge. But though the world would not believe that those\r\nconceptions and fancies which I writ were my own, but transcended my\r\ncapacity, yet they found fault, that they were defective for want of\r\nlearning, and on the other side, they said I had pluckt feathers out of\r\nthe universities; which was a very preposterous judgment. Truly, my\r\nlord, I confess that for want of scholarship, I could not express myself\r\nso well as otherwise I might have done in those philosophical writings I\r\npublished first; but after I was returned with your lordship into my\r\nnative country, and led a retired country life, I applied myself to the\r\nreading of philosophical authors, on purpose to learn those names and\r\nwords of art that are used in schools; which at first were so hard to\r\nme, that I could not understand them, but was fain to guess at the sense\r\nof them by the whole context, and so writ them down, as I found them in\r\nthose authors; at which my readers did wonder, and thought it impossible\r\nthat a woman could have so much learning and understanding in terms of\r\nart and scholastical expressions; so that I and my books are like the\r\nold apologue mentioned in Æsop, of a father and his son who rid on an\r\nass.\" Here follows a long narrative of this fable, which she applies to\r\nherself in these words--\"The old man seeing he could not please mankind\r\nin any manner, and having received so many blemishes and aspersions for\r\nthe sake of his ass, was at last resolved to drown him when he came to\r\nthe next bridge. But I am not so passionate to burn my writings for the\r\nvarious humours of mankind, and for their finding fault; since there is\r\nnothing in this world, be it the noblest and most commendable action\r\nwhatsoever, that shall escape blameless. As for my being the true and\r\nonly authoress of them, your lordship knows best; and my attending\r\nservants are witness that I have had none but my own thoughts, fancies,\r\nand speculations, to assist me; and as soon as I set them down I send\r\nthem to those that are to transcribe them, and fit them for the press;\r\nwhereof, since there have been several, and amongst them such as only\r\ncould write a good hand, but neither understood orthography, nor had any\r\nlearning, (I being then in banishment, with your lordship, and not able\r\nto maintain learned secretaries,) which hath been a great disadvantage\r\nto my poor works, and the cause that they have been printed so false and\r\nso full of errors; for besides that I want also skill in scholarship and\r\ntrue writing, I did many times not peruse the copies that were\r\ntranscribed, lest they should disturb my following conceptions; by which\r\nneglect, as I said, many errors are slipt into my works, which, yet I\r\nhope, learned and impartial men will soon rectify, and look more upon\r\nthe sense than carp at words. I have been a student even from childhood;\r\nand since I have been your lordship's wife I have lived for the most\r\npart a strict and retired life, as is best known to your lordship; and\r\ntherefore my censurers cannot know much of me, since they have little or\r\nno acquaintance with me. 'Tis true I have been a traveller both before\r\nand after I was married to your lordship, and some times shown myself at\r\nyour lordship's command in public places or assemblies, but yet I\r\nconverse with few. Indeed, my lord, I matter not the censures of this\r\nage, but am rather proud of them; for it shows that my actions are more\r\nthan ordinary, and according to the old proverb, it is better to be\r\nenvied than pitied; for I know well that it is merely out of spite and\r\nmalice, whereof this present age is so full that none can escape them,\r\nand they'll make no doubt to stain even your lordship's loyal, noble,\r\nand heroic actions, as well as they do mine; though yours have been of\r\nwar and fighting, mine of contemplating and writing: yours were\r\nperformed publicly in the field, mine privately in my closet; yours had\r\nmany thousand eye-witnesses; mine none but my waiting-maids. But the\r\ngreat God, that hitherto bless'd both your grace and me, will, I\r\nquestion not, preserve both our fames to after-ages.\r\n\r\n                \"Your grace's honest wife,\r\n                    \"and humble servant,\r\n                        \"M. NEWCASTLE.\"\r\n\r\nThe last portion of this life, which consists of the observations and\r\ngood things which she had gathered from the conversations of her\r\nhusband, forms an excellent Ana; and shows that when Lord Orford, in his\r\n\"Catalogue of Noble Authors,\" says, that \"this stately poetic couple was\r\na picture of foolish nobility,\" he writes, as he does too often, with\r\nextreme levity. But we must now attend to the reverse of our medal.\r\n\r\nMany chagrins may corrode the nuptial state of literary men. Females\r\nwho, prompted by vanity, but not by taste, unite themselves to scholars,\r\nmust ever complain of neglect. The inexhaustible occupations of a\r\nlibrary will only present to such a most dreary solitude. Such a lady\r\ndeclared of her learned husband, that she was more jealous of his books\r\nthan his mistresses. It was probably while Glover was composing his\r\n\"Leonidas,\" that his lady avenged herself for this _Homeric_ inattention\r\nto her, and took her flight with a lover. It was peculiar to the learned\r\nDacier to be united to woman, his equal in erudition and his superior in\r\ntaste. When she wrote in the album of a German traveller a verse from\r\nSophocles as an apology for her unwillingness to place herself among his\r\nlearned friends, that \"Silence is the female's ornament,\" it was a trait\r\nof her modesty. The learned Pasquier was coupled to a female of a\r\ndifferent character, since he tells us in one of his Epigrams that to\r\nmanage the vociferations of his lady, he was compelled himself to become\r\na vociferator.--\"Unfortunate wretch that I am, I who am a lover of\r\nuniversal peace! But to have peace I am obliged ever to be at war.\"\r\n\r\nSir Thomas More was united to a woman of the harshest temper and the\r\nmost sordid manners. To soften the moroseness of her disposition, \"he\r\npersuaded her to play on the lute, viol, and other instruments, every\r\nday.\" Whether it was that she had no ear for music, she herself never\r\nbecame harmonious as the instrument she touched. All these ladies may be\r\nconsidered as rather too alert in thought, and too spirited in action;\r\nbut a tame cuckoo bird who is always repeating the same note must be\r\nvery fatiguing. The lady of Samuel Clarke, the great compiler of books\r\nin 1680, whose name was anagrammatised to \"_suck all cream_,\" alluding\r\nto his indefatigable labours in sucking all the cream of every other\r\nauthor, without having any cream himself, is described by her husband as\r\nentertaining the most sublime conceptions of his illustrious\r\ncompilations. This appears by her behaviour. He says, \"that she never\r\nrose from table without making him a curtsey, nor drank to him without\r\nbowing, and that his word was a law to her.\"\r\n\r\nI was much surprised in looking over a correspondence of the times, that\r\nin 1590 the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, writing to the Earl of\r\nShrewsbury on the subject of his living separate from his countess, uses\r\nas one of his arguments for their union the following curious one, which\r\nsurely shows the gross and cynical feeling which the fair sex excited\r\neven among the higher classes of society. The language of this good\r\nbishop is neither that of truth, we hope, nor certainly that of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n\"But some will saye in your Lordship's behalfe that the Countesse is a\r\nsharpe and bitter shrewe, and therefore licke enough to shorten your\r\nlief, if shee should kepe yow company, Indeede, my good Lord, I have\r\nheard some say so; but if shrewdnesse or sharpnesse may be a juste cause\r\nof separation between a man and wiefe, I thinck fewe men in Englande\r\nwould keepe their wives longe; for it is a common jeste, yet trewe in\r\nsome sense, that there is but one shrewe in all the worlde, and everee\r\nman hath her: and so everee man must be ridd of his wiefe that wolde be\r\nridd of a shrewe.\" It is wonderful this good bishop did not use another\r\nargument as cogent, and which would in those times be allowed as\r\nsomething; the name of his lordship, _Shrewsbury_, would have afforded a\r\nconsolatory _pun_!\r\n\r\nThe entertaining Marville says that the generality of ladies married to\r\nliterary men are so vain of the abilities and merit of their husbands,\r\nthat they are frequently insufferable.\r\n\r\nThe wife of Barclay, author of \"The Argenis,\" considered herself as the\r\nwife of a demigod. This appeared glaringly after his death; for Cardinal\r\nBarberini having erected a monument to the memory of his tutor, next to\r\nthe tomb of Barclay, Mrs. Barclay was so irritated at this that she\r\ndemolished his monument, brought home his bust, and declared that the\r\nashes of so great a genius as her husband should never be placed beside\r\na pedagogue.\r\n\r\nSalmasius's wife was a termagant; Christina said she admired his\r\npatience more than his erudition. Mrs. Salmasius indeed considered\r\nherself as the queen of science, because her husband was acknowledged as\r\nsovereign among the critics. She boasted that she had for her husband\r\nthe most learned of all the nobles, and the most noble of all the\r\nlearned. Our good lady always joined the learned conferences which he\r\nheld in his study. She spoke loud, and decided with a tone of majesty.\r\nSalmasius was mild in conversation, but the reverse in his writings, for\r\nour proud Xantippe considered him as acting beneath himself if he did\r\nnot magisterially call every one names!\r\n\r\nThe wife of Rohault, when her husband gave lectures on the philosophy of\r\nDescartes, used to seat herself on these days at the door, and refused\r\nadmittance to every one shabbily dressed, or who did not discover a\r\ngenteel air. So convinced was she that, to be worthy of hearing the\r\nlectures of her husband, it was proper to appear fashionable. In vain\r\nour good lecturer exhausted himself in telling her, that fortune does\r\nnot always give fine clothes to philosophers.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Albert Durer and Berghem were both shrews. The wife of\r\nDurer compelled that great genius to the hourly drudgery of his\r\nprofession, merely to gratify her own sordid passion: in despair, Albert\r\nran away from his Tisiphone; she wheedled him back, and not long\r\nafterwards this great artist fell a victim to her furious\r\ndisposition.[95] Berghem's wife would never allow that excellent artist\r\nto quit his occupations; and she contrived an odd expedient to detect\r\nhis indolence. The artist worked in a room above her; ever and anon she\r\nroused him by thumping a long stick against the ceiling, while the\r\nobedient Berghem answered by stamping his foot, to satisfy Mrs. Berghem\r\nthat he was not napping.\r\n\r\nÆlian had an aversion to the married state. Sigonius, a learned and\r\nwell-known scholar, would never marry, and alleged no inelegant reason;\r\n\"Minerva and Venus could not live together.\"\r\n\r\nMatrimony has been considered by some writers as a condition not so well\r\nsuited to the circumstances of philosophers and men of learning. There\r\nis a little tract which professes to investigate the subject. It has for\r\ntitle, _De Matrimonio Literati, an coelibem esse, an verò nubere\r\nconveniat_, i.e., of the Marriage of a Man of Letters, with an inquiry\r\nwhether it is most proper for him to continue a bachelor, or to marry?\r\n\r\nThe author alleges the great merit of some women; particularly that of\r\nGonzaga the consort of Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino; a lady of such\r\ndistinguished accomplishments, that Peter Bembus said, none but a stupid\r\nman would not prefer one of her conversations to all the formal meetings\r\nand disputations of the philosophers.\r\n\r\nThe ladies perhaps will be surprised to find that it is a question among\r\nthe learned, _Whether they ought to marry?_ and will think it an\r\nunaccountable property of learning that it should lay the professors of\r\nit under an obligation to disregard the sex. But it is very questionable\r\nwhether, in return for this want of complaisance in them, the generality\r\nof ladies would not prefer the beau, and the man of fashion. However,\r\nlet there be Gonzagas, they will find converts enough to their charms.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments of Sir Thomas Browne on the consequences of marriage are\r\nvery curious, in the second part of his Religio Medici, sect, 9. When he\r\nwrote that work, he said, \"I was never yet once, and commend their\r\nresolutions, who never marry twice.\" He calls woman \"the rib and crooked\r\npiece of man.\" He adds, \"I could be content that we might procreate like\r\ntrees, without conjunction, or that there were any way to procreate the\r\nworld without this trivial and vulgar way.\" He means the union of sexes,\r\nwhich he declares, \"is the foolishest act a wise man commits in all his\r\nlife; nor is there anything that will more deject his cooled\r\nimagination, when he shall consider what an odd and unworthy piece of\r\nfolly he hath committed.\" He afterwards declares he is not averse to\r\nthat sweet sex, but naturally amorous of all that is beautiful: \"I could\r\nlook a whole day with delight upon a handsome picture, though it be but\r\nof a horse.\" He afterwards disserts very profoundly on the music there\r\nis in beauty, \"and the silent note which Cupid strikes is far sweeter\r\nthan the sound of an instrument.\" Such were his sentiments when\r\nyouthful, and residing at Leyden; Dutch philosophy had at first chilled\r\nhis passion; it is probable that passion afterwards inflamed his\r\nphilosophy--for he married, and had sons and daughters!\r\n\r\nDr. Cocchi, a modern Italian writer, but apparently a cynic as old as\r\nDiogenes, has taken the pains of composing a treatise on the present\r\nsubject enough to terrify the boldest _Bachelor_ of Arts! He has\r\nconjured up every chimera against the marriage of a literary man. He\r\nseems, however, to have drawn his disgusting portrait from his own\r\ncountry; and the chaste beauty of Britain only looks the more lovely\r\nbeside this Florentine wife.\r\n\r\nI shall not retain the cynicism which has coloured such revolting\r\nfeatures. When at length the doctor finds a woman as all women ought to\r\nbe, he opens a new string of misfortunes which must attend her husband.\r\nHe dreads one of the probable consequences of matrimony--progeny, in\r\nwhich we must maintain the children we beget! He thinks the father gains\r\nnothing in his old age from the tender offices administered by his own\r\nchildren: he asserts these are much better performed by menials and\r\nstrangers! The more children he has, the less he can afford to have\r\nservants! The maintenance of his children will greatly diminish his\r\nproperty! Another alarming object in marriage is that, by affinity, you\r\nbecome connected with the relations of the wife. The envious and\r\nill-bred insinuations of the mother, the family quarrels, their poverty\r\nor their pride, all disturb the unhappy sage who falls into the trap of\r\nconnubial felicity! But if a sage has resolved to marry, he impresses on\r\nhim the prudential principle of increasing his fortune by it, and to\r\nremember his \"additional expenses!\" Dr. Cocchi seems to have thought\r\nthat a human being is only to live for himself; he had neither heart to\r\nfeel, a head to conceive, nor a pen that could have written one\r\nharmonious period, or one beautiful image! Bayle, in his article\r\n_Raphelengius_, note B, gives a singular specimen of logical subtlety,\r\nin \"a reflection on the consequence of marriage.\" This learned man was\r\nimagined to have died of grief, for having lost his wife, and passed\r\nthree years in protracted despair. What therefore must we think of an\r\nunhappy marriage, since a happy one is exposed to such evils? He then\r\nshows that an unhappy marriage is attended by beneficial consequences to\r\nthe survivor. In this dilemma, in the one case, the husband lives afraid\r\nhis wife will die, in the other that she will not! If you love her, you\r\nwill always be afraid of losing her; if you do not love her, you will\r\nalways be afraid of not losing her. Our satirical _celibataire_ is gored\r\nby the horns of the dilemma he has conjured up.\r\n\r\nJames Petiver, a famous botanist, then a bachelor, the friend of Sir\r\nHans Sloane, in an album signs his name with this designation:--\r\n\r\n    \"From the Goat tavern in the Strand, London,\r\n    Nov. 27. In the 34th year of my _freedom_,\r\n    A.D. 1697.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Erroneous proper names of places occur continually in\r\nearly writers, particularly French ones. There are some in Froissart\r\nthat cannot be at all understood. Bassompierre is equally erroneous.\r\n_Jorchaux_ is intended by him for _York House_; and, more wonderful\r\nstill, _Inhimthort_, proves by the context to be _Kensington_!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Leopold Schefer, the German novelist, has composed an\r\nexcellent sketch of Durer's married life. It is an admirably philosophic\r\nnarrative of an intellectual man's wretchedness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome authors excelled in this species of literary artifice. The Italian\r\nDoni dedicated each of his letters in a book called _La Libraria_, to\r\npersons whose name began with the first letter of the epistle, and\r\ndedicated the whole collection in another epistle; so that the book,\r\nwhich only consisted of forty-five pages, was dedicated to above twenty\r\npersons. This is carrying literary mendicity pretty high. Politi, the\r\neditor of the _Martyrologium Romanum_, published at Rome in 1751, has\r\nimproved on the idea of Doni; for to the 365 days of the year of this\r\nMartyrology he has prefixed to each an epistle dedicatory. It is\r\nfortunate to have a large circle of acquaintance, though they should not\r\nbe worthy of being saints. Galland, the translator of the Arabian\r\nNights, prefixed a dedication to each tale which he gave; had he\r\nfinished the \"one thousand and one,\" he would have surpassed even the\r\nMartyrologist.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Scudery tells a remarkable expedient of an ingenious trader\r\nin this line--One Rangouze made a collection of letters which he printed\r\nwithout numbering them. By this means the bookbinder put that letter\r\nwhich the author ordered him first; so that all the persons to whom he\r\npresented this book, seeing their names at the head, considered they had\r\nreceived a particular compliment. An Italian physician, having written\r\non Hippocrates's Aphorisms, dedicated each book of his Commentaries to\r\none of his friends, and the index to another!\r\n\r\nMore than one of our own authors have dedications in the same spirit. It\r\nwas an expedient to procure dedicatory fees: for publishing books by\r\nsubscription was then an art undiscovered. One prefixed a different\r\ndedication to a certain number of printed copies, and addressed them to\r\nevery great man he knew, who he thought relished a morsel of flattery,\r\nand would pay handsomely for a coarse luxury. Sir Balthazar Gerbier, in\r\nhis \"Counsel to Builders,\" has made up half the work with forty-two\r\ndedications, which he excuses by the example of Antonio Perez; but in\r\nthese dedications Perez scatters a heap of curious things, for he was a\r\nvery universal genius. Perez, once secretary of state to Philip II. of\r\nSpain, dedicates his \"Obras,\" first to \"Nuestro sanctissimo Padre,\" and\r\n\"Al Sacro Collegio,\" then follows one to \"Henry IV.,\" and then one still\r\nmore embracing, \"A Todos.\" Fuller, in his \"Church History,\" has with\r\nadmirable contrivance introduced twelve title-pages, besides the general\r\none, and as many particular dedications, and no less than fifty or sixty\r\nof those by inscriptions which are addressed to his benefactors; a\r\ncircumstance which Heylin in his severity did not overlook; for \"making\r\nhis work bigger by forty sheets at the least; and he was so ambitious of\r\nthe number of his patrons, that having but four leaves at the end of his\r\nHistory, he discovers a particular benefactress to inscribe them to!\"\r\nThis unlucky lady, the patroness of four leaves, Heylin compares to\r\nRoscius Regulus, who accepted the consular dignity for that part of the\r\nday on which Cecina by a decree of the senate was degraded from it,\r\nwhich occasioned Regulus to be ridiculed by the people all his life\r\nafter, as the consul of half a day.\r\n\r\nThe price for the dedication of a play was at length fixed, from five to\r\nten guineas from the Revolution to the time of George I., when it rose\r\nto twenty; but sometimes a bargain was to be struck when the author and\r\nthe play were alike indifferent. Sometimes the party haggled about the\r\nprice, or the statue while stepping into his niche would turn round on\r\nthe author to assist his invention. A patron of Peter Motteux,\r\ndissatisfied with Peter's colder temperament, actually composed the\r\nsuperlative dedication to himself, and completed the misery of the\r\napparent author by subscribing it with his name. This circumstance was\r\nso notorious at the time, that it occasioned a satirical dialogue\r\nbetween Motteux and his patron Heveningham. The patron, in his zeal to\r\nomit no possible distinction that might attach to him, had given one\r\ncircumstance which no one but himself could have known.\r\n\r\n        PATRON.\r\n\r\n        I must confess I was to blame,\r\n        That one particular to name;\r\n        The rest could never have been known\r\n        _I made the style so like thy own_.\r\n\r\n        POET.\r\n\r\n        I beg your pardon, Sir, for that.\r\n\r\n        PATRON.\r\n\r\n        Why d----e what would you be at?\r\n        I _writ below myself_, you sot!\r\n        Avoiding figures, tropes, what not;\r\n        For fear I should my fancy raise\r\n        _Above the level of thy plays_!\r\n\r\nWarton notices the common practice, about the reign of Elizabeth, of an\r\nauthor's dedicating a work at once to a number of the nobility.\r\nChapman's Translation of Homer has sixteen sonnets addressed to lords\r\nand ladies. Henry Lock, in a collection of two hundred religious\r\nsonnets, mingles with such heavenly works the terrestrial composition of\r\na number of sonnets to his noble patrons; and not to multiply more\r\ninstances, our great poet Spenser, in compliance with this disgraceful\r\ncustom, or rather in obedience to the established tyranny of patronage,\r\nhas prefixed to the Faery Queen fifteen of these adulatory pieces, which\r\nin every respect are the meanest of his compositions. At this period all\r\nmen, as well as writers, looked up to the peers as if they were beings\r\non whose smiles or frowns all sublunary good and evil depended. At a\r\nmuch later period, Elkanah Settle sent copies round to the chief party,\r\nfor he wrote for both parties, accompanied by addresses to extort\r\npecuniary presents in return. He had latterly one standard _Elegy_, and\r\none _Epithalamium_, printed off with blanks, which by ingeniously\r\nfilling up with the printed names of any great person who died or was\r\nmarried; no one who was going out of life, or was entering into it,\r\ncould pass scot-free.\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular anecdotes respecting DEDICATIONS in English\r\nbibliography is that of the Polyglot Bible of Dr. Castell. Cromwell,\r\nmuch to his honour, patronized that great labour, and allowed the paper\r\nto be imported free of all duties, both of excise and custom. It was\r\npublished under the protectorate, but many copies had not been disposed\r\nof ere Charles II. ascended the throne. Dr. Castell had dedicated the\r\nwork gratefully to Oliver, by mentioning him with peculiar respect in\r\nthe preface, but he wavered with Richard Cromwell. At the Restoration,\r\nhe cancelled the two last leaves, and supplied their places with three\r\nothers, which softened down the republican strains, and blotted\r\nOliver's name out of the book of life! The differences in what are now\r\ncalled the _republican_ and the _loyal_ copies have amused the curious\r\ncollectors; and the former being very scarce, are most sought after. I\r\nhave seen the republican. In the _loyal_ copies the patrons of the work\r\nare mentioned, but their _titles_ are essentially changed;\r\n_Serenissimus_, _Illustrissimus_, and _Honoratissimus_, were epithets\r\nthat dared not shew themselves under the _levelling_ influence of the\r\ngreat fanatic republican.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious literary folly, not of an individual but of the Spanish\r\nnation, who, when the laws of Castile were reduced into a code under the\r\nreign of Alfonso X. surnamed the Wise, divided the work into _seven\r\nvolumes_; that they might be dedicated to the _seven letters_ which\r\nformed the name of his majesty!\r\n\r\nNever was a gigantic baby of adulation so crammed with the soft pap of\r\n_Dedications_ as Cardinal Richelieu. French flattery even exceeded\r\nitself.--Among the vast number of very extraordinary dedications to this\r\nman, in which the Divinity itself is disrobed of its attributes to\r\nbestow them on this miserable creature of vanity, I suspect that even\r\nthe following one is not the most blasphemous he received. \"Who has seen\r\nyour face without being seized by those softened terrors which made the\r\nprophets shudder when God showed the beams of his glory! But as He whom\r\nthey dared not to approach in the burning bush, and in the noise of\r\nthunders, appeared to them sometimes in the freshness of the zephyrs, so\r\nthe softness of your august countenance dissipates at the same time, and\r\nchanges into dew, the small vapours which cover its majesty.\" One of\r\nthese herd of dedicators, after the death of Richelieu, suppressed in a\r\nsecond edition his hyperbolical panegyric, and as a punishment to\r\nhimself, dedicated the work to Jesus Christ!\r\n\r\nThe same taste characterises our own dedications in the reigns of\r\nCharles II. and James II. The great Dryden has carried it to an\r\nexcessive height; and nothing is more usual than to compare the _patron_\r\nwith the _Divinity_--and at times a fair inference may be drawn that the\r\nformer was more in the author's mind than God himself! A Welsh bishop\r\nmade an _apology_ to James I. for _preferring_ the Deity--to his\r\nMajesty! Dryden's extravagant dedications were the vices of the time\r\nmore than of the man; they were loaded with flattery, and no disgrace\r\nwas annexed to such an exercise of men's talents; the contest being who\r\nshould go farthest in the most graceful way, and with the best turns of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious dedication was contrived by Sir Simon Degge, who dedicated\r\n\"the Parson's Counsellor\" to Woods, Bishop of Lichfield. Degge highly\r\ncomplimented the bishop on having most nobly restored the church, which\r\nhad been demolished in the civil wars, and was rebuilt but left\r\nunfinished by Bishop Hacket. At the time he wrote the dedication, Woods\r\nhad not turned a single stone, and it is said, that much against his\r\nwill he did something, from having been so publicly reminded of it by\r\nthis ironical dedication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHICAL DESCRIPTIVE POEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"BOTANIC GARDEN\" once appeared to open a new route through the\r\ntrodden groves of Parnassus. The poet, to a prodigality of IMAGINATION,\r\nunited all the minute accuracy of SCIENCE. It is a highly-repolished\r\nlabour, and was in the mind and in the hand of its author for twenty\r\nyears before its first publication. The excessive polish of the verse\r\nhas appeared too high to be endured throughout a long composition; it is\r\ncertain that, in poems of length, a versification, which is not too\r\nflorid for lyrical composition, will weary by its brilliance. Darwin,\r\ninasmuch as a rich philosophical fancy constitutes a poet, possesses the\r\nentire art of poetry; no one has carried the curious mechanism of verse\r\nand the artificial magic of poetical diction to a higher perfection. His\r\nvolcanic head flamed with imagination, but his torpid heart slept\r\nunawakened by passion. His standard of poetry is by much too limited; he\r\nsupposes that the essence of poetry is something of which a painter can\r\nmake a picture. A picturesque verse was with him a verse completely\r\npoetical. But the language of the passions has no connexion with this\r\nprinciple; in truth, what he delineates as poetry itself, is but one of\r\nits provinces. Deceived by his illusive standard, he has composed a poem\r\nwhich is perpetually fancy, and never passion. Hence his processional\r\nsplendour fatigues, and his descriptive ingenuity comes at length to be\r\ndeficient in novelty, and all the miracles of art cannot supply us with\r\none touch of nature.\r\n\r\nDescriptive poetry should be relieved by a skilful intermixture of\r\npassages addressed to the heart as well as to the imagination: uniform\r\ndescription satiates; and has been considered as one of the inferior\r\nbranches of poetry. Of this both Thomson and Goldsmith were sensible. In\r\ntheir beautiful descriptive poems they knew the art of animating the\r\npictures of FANCY with the glow of SENTIMENT.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the originality of Darwin's poem, it had been\r\npreceded by others of a congenial disposition. Brookes's poem on\r\n\"Universal Beauty,\" published about 1735, presents us with the very\r\nmodel of Darwin's versification: and the Latin poem of De la Croix, in\r\n1727, entitled \"_Connubia Florum_,\" with his subject. There also exists\r\na race of poems which have hitherto been confined to _one subject_,\r\nwhich the poet selected from the works of nature, to embellish with all\r\nthe splendour of poetic imagination. I have collected some titles.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is Homer, in his battle of the _Frogs and Mice_, and Virgil\r\nin the poem on a _Gnat_, attributed to him, who have given birth to\r\nthese lusory poems. The Jesuits, particularly when they composed in\r\nLatin verse, were partial to such subjects. There is a little poem on\r\n_Gold_, by P. Le Fevre, distinguished for its elegance; and Brumoy has\r\ngiven the _Art of making Glass_; in which he has described its various\r\nproductions with equal felicity and knowledge. P. Vanière has written on\r\n_Pigeons_, Du Cerceau on _Butterflies_. The success which attended these\r\nproductions produced numerous imitations, of which several were\r\nfavourably received. Vanière composed three on the _Grape_, the\r\n_Vintage_, and the _Kitchen Garden_. Another poet selected _Oranges_ for\r\nhis theme; others have chosen for their subjects, _Paper, Birds_, and\r\nfresh-water _Fish_. Tarillon has inflamed his imagination with\r\n_gunpowder_; a milder genius, delighted with the oaten pipe, sang of\r\n_Sheep_; one who was more pleased with another kind of pipe, has written\r\non _Tobacco_; and a droll genius wrote a poem on _Asses_. Two writers\r\nhave formed didactic poems on the _Art of Enigmas_, and on _Ships_.\r\n\r\nOthers have written on moral subjects. Brumoy has painted the\r\n_Passions_, with a variety of imagery and vivacity of description; P.\r\nMeyer has disserted on _Anger_; Tarillon, like our Stillingfleet, on the\r\n_Art of Conversation_; and a lively writer has discussed the subjects of\r\n_Humour and Wit_.\r\n\r\nGiannetazzi, an Italian Jesuit, celebrated for his Latin poetry, has\r\ncomposed two volumes of poems on _Fishing_ and _Navigation_. Fracastor\r\nhas written delicately on an indelicate subject, his _Syphilis_. Le Brun\r\nwrote a delectable poem on _Sweetmeats_; another writer on _Mineral\r\nWaters_, and a third on _Printing_. Vida pleases with his _Silk-worms_,\r\nand his _Chess_; Buchanan is ingenious with the _Sphere_. Malapert has\r\naspired to catch the _Winds_; the philosophic Huet amused himself with\r\n_Salt_ and again with _Tea_. The _Gardens_ of Rapin is a finer poem than\r\ncritics generally can write; Quillet's _Callipedia_, or Art of getting\r\nhandsome Children, has been translated by Rowe; and Du Fresnoy at length\r\ngratifies the connoisseur with his poem on _Painting_, by the\r\nembellishments which his verses have received from the poetic diction of\r\nMason, and the commentary of Reynolds.\r\n\r\nThis list might be augmented with a few of our own poets, and there\r\nstill remain some virgin themes which only require to be touched by the\r\nhand of a true poet. In the \"Memoirs of Trevoux,\" they observe, in their\r\nreview of the poem on _Gold_, \"That poems of this kind have the\r\nadvantage of instructing us very agreeably. All that has been most\r\nremarkably said on the subject is united, compressed in a luminous\r\norder, and dressed in all the agreeable graces of poetry. Such writers\r\nhave no little difficulties to encounter: the style and expression cost\r\ndear; and still more to give to an arid topic an agreeable form, and to\r\nelevate the subject without falling into another extreme.--In the other\r\nkinds of poetry the matter assists and prompts genius; here we must\r\npossess an abundance to display it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAMPHLETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMyles Davis's \"ICON LIBELLORUM, or a Critical History Pamphlets,\"\r\naffords some curious information; and as this is a _pamphlet_-reading\r\nage, I shall give a sketch of its contents.\r\n\r\nThe author observes: \"From PAMPHLETS may be learned the genius of the\r\nage, the debates of the learned, the follies of the ignorant, the\r\n_bévues_ of government, and the mistakes of the courtiers. Pamphlets\r\nfurnish beaus with their airs, coquettes with their charms. Pamphlets\r\nare as modish ornaments to gentlewomen's toilets as to gentlemen's\r\npockets; they carry reputation of wit and learning to all that make them\r\ntheir companions; the poor find their account in stall-keeping and in\r\nhawking them; the rich find in them their shortest way to the secrets of\r\nchurch and state. There is scarce any class of people but may think\r\nthemselves interested enough to be concerned with what is published in\r\npamphlets, either as to their private instruction, curiosity, and\r\nreputation, or to the public advantage and credit; with all which both\r\nancient and modern pamphlets are too often over familiar and free.--In\r\nshort, with pamphlets the booksellers and stationers adorn the gaiety of\r\nshop-gazing. Hence accrues to grocers, apothecaries, and chandlers, good\r\nfurniture, and supplies to necessary retreats and natural occasions. In\r\npamphlets lawyers will meet with their chicanery, physicians with their\r\ncant, divines with their Shibboleth. Pamphlets become more and more\r\ndaily amusements to the curious, idle, and inquisitive; pastime to\r\ngallants and coquettes; chat to the talkative; catch-words to informers;\r\nfuel to the envious; poison to the unfortunate; balsam to the wounded;\r\nemploy to the lazy; and fabulous materials to romancers and novelists.\"\r\n\r\nThis author sketches the origin and rise of pamphlets. He deduces them\r\nfrom the short writings published by the Jewish Rabbins; various little\r\npieces at the time of the first propagation of Christianity; and notices\r\na certain pamphlet which was pretended to have been the composition of\r\nJesus Christ, thrown from heaven, and picked up by the archangel Michael\r\nat the entrance of Jerusalem. It was copied by the priest Leora, and\r\nsent about from priest to priest, till Pope Zachary ventured to\r\npronounce it a _forgery_. He notices several such extraordinary\r\npublications, many of which produced as extraordinary effects.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds in noticing the first Arian and Popish pamphlets, or rather\r\n_libels_, i. e. little books, as he distinguishes them. He relates a\r\ncurious anecdote respecting the forgeries of the monks. Archbishop Usher\r\ndetected in a manuscript of St. Patrick's life, pretended to have been\r\nfound at Louvain, as an original of a very remote date, several passages\r\ntaken, with little alteration, from his own writings.\r\n\r\nThe following notice of our immortal Pope I cannot pass over: \"Another\r\nclass of pamphlets writ by Roman Catholics is that of _Poems_, written\r\nchiefly by a Pope himself, a gentleman of that name. He passed always\r\namongst most of his acquaintance for what is commonly called a Whig; for\r\nit seems the Roman politics are divided as well as popish missionaries.\r\nHowever, one _Esdras_, an apothecary, as he qualifies himself, has\r\npublished a piping-hot pamphlet against Mr. Pope's '_Rape of the Lock_,'\r\nwhich he entitles '_A Key to the Lock_,' wherewith he pretends to unlock\r\nnothing less than a _plot_ carried on by Mr. Pope in that poem against\r\nthe last and this present ministry and government.\"\r\n\r\nHe observes on _Sermons_,--\"'Tis not much to be questioned, but of all\r\nmodern pamphlets what or wheresoever, the _English stitched Sermons_ be\r\nthe most edifying, useful, and instructive, yet they could not escape\r\nthe critical Mr. Bayle's sarcasm. He says, 'République des Lettres,'\r\nMarch, 1710, in this article _London_, 'We see here sermons swarm daily\r\nfrom the press. Our eyes only behold manna: are you desirous of knowing\r\nthe reason? It is, that the ministers being allowed to _read_ their\r\nsermons in the pulpit, _buy all they meet with_, and take no other\r\ntrouble than to read them, and thus pass for very able scholars at a\r\nvery cheap rate!'\"\r\n\r\nHe now begins more directly the history of pamphlets, which he branches\r\nout from four different etymologies. He says, \"However foreign the word\r\n_Pamphlet_ may appear, it is a genuine English word, rarely known or\r\nadopted in any other language: its pedigree cannot well be traced higher\r\nthan the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign. In its first state\r\nwretched must have been its appearance, since the great linguist John\r\nMinshew, in his '_Guide into Tongues_,' printed in 1617, gives it the\r\nmost miserable character of which any libel can be capable. Mr. Minshew\r\nsays (and his words were quoted by Lord Chief Justice Holt), 'A\r\nPAMPHLET, that is _Opusculum Stolidorum_, the diminutive performance of\r\nfools; from [Greek: pan], _all_, and [Greek: plêtho], I _fill_, to wit,\r\n_all_ places. According to the vulgar saying, all things are full of\r\nfools, or foolish things; for such multitudes of pamphlets, unworthy of\r\nthe very names of libels, being more vile than common shores and the\r\nfilth of beggars, and being flying papers daubed over and besmeared with\r\nthe foams of drunkards, are tossed far and near into the mouths and\r\nhands of scoundrels; neither will the sham oracles of Apollo be esteemed\r\nso mercenary as a Pamphlet.'\"\r\n\r\nThose who will have the word to be derived from PAM, the famous knave of\r\nLOO, do not differ much from Minshew; for the derivation of the word\r\n_Pam_ is in all probability from [Greek: pan], _all_; or the _whole_ or\r\nthe _chief_ of the game.\r\n\r\nUnder this _first_ etymological notion of Pamphlets may be comprehended\r\nthe _vulgar stories_ of the Nine Worthies of the World, of the Seven\r\nChampions of Christendom, Tom Thumb, Valentine and Orson, &c., as also\r\nmost of apocryphal lucubrations. The greatest collection of this first\r\nsort of Pamphlets are the Rabbinic traditions in the Talmud, consisting\r\nof fourteen volumes in folio, and the Popish legends of the Lives of the\r\nSaints, which, though not finished, form fifty folio volumes, all which\r\ntracts were originally in pamphlet forms.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ idea of the _radix_ of the word _Pamphlet_ is, that it\r\ntakes its derivations from [Greek: pan], _all_, and [Greek: phileo], _I\r\nlove_, signifying a thing beloved by all; for a pamphlet being of a\r\nsmall portable bulk, and of no great price, is adapted to every one's\r\nunderstanding and reading. In this class may be placed all stitched\r\nbooks on serious subjects, the best of which fugitive pieces have been\r\ngenerally preserved, and even reprinted in collections of some tracts,\r\nmiscellanies, sermons, poems, &c.; and, on the contrary, bulky volumes\r\nhave been reduced, for the convenience of the public, into the familiar\r\nshapes of stitched pamphlets. Both these methods have been thus censured\r\nby the majority of the lower house of convocation 1711. These abuses are\r\nthus represented: \"They have republished, and collected into volumes,\r\npieces written long ago on the side of infidelity. They have reprinted\r\ntogether in the most contracted manner, many loose and licentious\r\npieces, in order to their being purchased more cheaply, and dispersed\r\nmore easily.\"\r\n\r\nThe _third_ original interpretation of the word Pamphlet may be that of\r\nthe learned Dr. Skinner, in his _Etymologicon Linguæ Anglicanæ_, that it\r\nis derived from the Belgic word _Pampier_, signifying a little paper, or\r\nlibel. To this third set of Pamphlets may be reduced all sorts of\r\nprinted single sheets, or half sheets, or any other quantity of single\r\npaper prints, such as Declarations, Remonstrances, Proclamations,\r\nEdicts, Orders, Injunctions, Memorials, Addresses, Newspapers, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth_ radical signification of the word Pamphlet is that\r\nhomogeneal acceptation of it, viz., as it imports any little book, or\r\nsmall volume whatever, whether stitched or bound, whether good or bad,\r\nwhether serious or ludicrous. The only proper Latin term for a Pamphlet\r\nis _Libellus_, or little book. This word indeed signifies in English an\r\n_abusive_ paper or little book, and is generally taken in the worst\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nAfter all this display of curious literature, the reader may smile at\r\nthe guesses of Etymologists; particularly when he is reminded that the\r\nderivation of _Pamphlet_ is drawn from quite another meaning to any of\r\nthe present, by Johnson, which I shall give for his immediate\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\nPAMPHLET [_par un filet_, Fr. Whence this word is written anciently, and\r\nby Caxton, _paunflet_] a small book; properly a book sold unbound, and\r\nonly stitched.\r\n\r\nThe French have borrowed the word _Pamphlet_ from us, and have the\r\ngoodness of not disfiguring its orthography. _Roast Beef_ is also in the\r\nsame predicament. I conclude that _Pamphlets_ and _Roast Beef_ have\r\ntherefore their origin in our country.\r\n\r\nPinkerton favoured me with the following curious notice concerning\r\npamphlets:--\r\n\r\n\"Of the etymon of _pamphlet_ I know nothing; but that the word is far\r\nmore ancient than is commonly believed, take the following proof from\r\nthe celebrated _Philobiblon_, ascribed to Richard de Buri, bishop of\r\nDurham, but written by Robert Holkot, at his desire, as Fabricius says,\r\nabout the year 1344, (Fabr. Bibl. Medii Ævi, vol. i.); it is in the\r\neighth chapter.\r\n\r\n\"Sed, revera, libros non libras maluimus; codicesque plus dileximus quam\r\nflorenos: ac PANFLETOS exiguos phaleratis prætulimus palescedis.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, indeed, we prefer books to pounds; and we love manuscripts better\r\nthan florins; and we prefer small _pamphlets_ to war horses.\"\r\n\r\nThis word is as old as Lydgate's time: among his works, quoted by\r\nWarton, is a poem \"translated from a _pamflete_ in Frenshe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMyles Davies has given an opinion of the advantages of Little Books,\r\nwith some humour.\r\n\r\n\"The smallness of the size of a book was always its own commendation;\r\nas, on the contrary, the largeness of a book is its own disadvantage, as\r\nwell as the terror of learning. In short, a big book is a scare-crow to\r\nthe head and pocket of the author, student, buyer, and seller, as well\r\nas a harbour of ignorance; hence the inaccessible masteries of the\r\ninexpugnable ignorance and superstition of the ancient heathens,\r\ndegenerate Jews, and of the popish scholasters and canonists,\r\nentrenched under the frightful bulk of huge, vast, and innumerable\r\nvolumes; such as the great folio that the Jewish rabbins fancied in a\r\ndream was given by the angel Raziel to his pupil Adam, containing all\r\nthe celestial sciences. And the volumes writ by Zoroaster, entitled The\r\nSimilitude, which is said to have taken up no more space than 1260 hides\r\nof cattle: as also the 25,000, or, as some say, 36,000 volumes, besides\r\n525 lesser MSS. of his. The grossness and multitude of Aristotle and\r\nVarro's books were both a prejudice to the authors, and an hindrance to\r\nlearning, and an occasion of the greatest part of them being lost. The\r\nlargeness of Plutarch's treatises is a great cause of his being\r\nneglected, while Longinus and Epictetus, in their pamphlet Remains, are\r\nevery one's companions. Origen's 6000 volumes (as Epiphanius will have\r\nit) were not only the occasion of his venting more numerous errors, but\r\nalso for the most part of their perdition.--Were it not for Euclid's\r\nElements, Hippocrates' Aphorisms, Justinian's Institutes, and\r\nLittleton's Tenures, in small pamphlet volumes, young mathematicians,\r\nfresh-water physicians, civilian novices, and _les apprentices en la ley\r\nd'Angleterre_, would be at a loss and stand, and total disencouragement.\r\nOne of the greatest advantages the _Dispensary_ has over _King Arthur_\r\nis its pamphlet size. So Boileau's Lutrin, and his other pamphlet poems,\r\nin respect of Perrault's and Chapelain's St. Paulin and la Pucelle.\r\n_These_ seem to pay a deference to the reader's quick and great\r\nunderstanding; _those_ to mistrust his capacity, and to confine his time\r\nas well as his intellect.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding so much may be alleged in favour of books of a small\r\nsize, yet the scholars of a former age regarded them with contempt.\r\nScaliger, says Baillet, cavils with Drusius for the smallness of his\r\nbooks; and one of the great printers of the time (Moret, the successor\r\nof Plantin) complaining to the learned Puteanus, who was considered as\r\nthe rival of Lipsius, that his books were too small for sale, and that\r\npurchasers turned away, frightened at their diminutive size; Puteanus\r\nreferred him to Plutarch, whose works consist of small treatises; but\r\nthe printer took fire at the comparison, and turned him out of his shop,\r\nfor his vanity at pretending that he wrote in any manner like Plutarch!\r\na specimen this of the politeness and reverence of the early printers\r\nfor their learned authors; Jurieu reproaches Calomiès that he is _a\r\ngreat author of little books_!\r\n\r\nAt least, if a man is the author only of little books, he will escape\r\nthe sarcastic observation of Cicero on a voluminous writer--that \"his\r\nbody might be burned with his writings,\" of which we have had several,\r\neminent for the worthlessness and magnitude of their labours.\r\n\r\nIt was the literary humour of a certain Mæcenas, who cheered the lustre\r\nof his patronage with the steams of a good dinner, to place his guests\r\naccording to the size and thickness of the books they had printed. At\r\nthe head of the table sat those who had published in _folio,\r\nfoliissimo_; next the authors in _quarto_; then those in _octavo_. At\r\nthat table Blackmore would have had the precedence of Gray. Addison, who\r\nfound this anecdote in one of the Anas, has seized this idea, and\r\napplied it with his felicity of humour in No. 529 of the Spectator.\r\n\r\nMontaigne's Works have been called by a Cardinal, \"The Breviary of\r\nIdlers.\" It is therefore the book for many men. Francis Osborne has a\r\nludicrous image in favour of such opuscula. \"Huge volumes, like the ox\r\nroasted whole at Bartholomew fair, may proclaim plenty of labour, but\r\nafford less of what is _delicate_, _savoury_, and _well-concocted_, than\r\nSMALLER PIECES.\"\r\n\r\nIn the list of titles of minor works, which Aulus Gellius has preserved,\r\nthe lightness and beauty of such compositions are charmingly expressed.\r\nAmong these we find--a Basket of Flowers; an Embroidered Mantle; and a\r\nVariegated Meadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CATHOLIC'S REFUTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a religious book published by a fellow of the Society of Jesus,\r\nentitled, \"The Faith of a Catholic,\" the author examines what concerns\r\nthe incredulous Jews and other infidels. He would show that Jesus\r\nChrist, author of the religion which bears his name, did not impose on\r\nor deceive the Apostles whom he taught; that the Apostles who preached\r\nit did not deceive those who were converted; and that those who were\r\nconverted did not deceive us. In proving these three not difficult\r\npropositions, he says, he confounds \"the _Atheist_, who does not believe\r\nin God; the _Pagan_, who adores several; the _Deist_, who believes in\r\none God, but who rejects a particular Providence; the _Freethinker_, who\r\npresumes to serve God according to his fancy, without being attached to\r\nany religion; the _Philosopher_, who takes reason and not revelation for\r\nthe rule of his belief; the _Gentile_, who, never having regarded the\r\nJewish people as a chosen nation, does not believe God promised them a\r\nMessiah; and finally, the _Jew_, who refuses to adore the Messiah in the\r\nperson of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nI have given this sketch, as it serves for a singular Catalogue of\r\n_Heretics_.\r\n\r\nIt is rather singular that so late as in the year 1765, a work should\r\nhave appeared in Paris, which bears the title I translate, \"The\r\nChristian Religion _proved_ by a _single fact_; or a dissertation in\r\nwhich is shown that those _Catholics_ of whom Huneric, King of the\r\nVandals, cut the tongues, _spoke miraculously_ all the remainder of\r\ntheir days; from whence is deduced the _consequences of this miracle_\r\nagainst the Arians, the Socinians, and the Deists, and particularly\r\nagainst the author of Emilius, by solving their difficulties.\" It bears\r\nthis Epigraph, \"_Ecce Ego admirationem faciam populo huic, miraculo\r\ngrandi et stupendo_.\" There needs no further account of this book than\r\nthe title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOOD ADVICE OF AN OLD LITERARY SINNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors of moderate capacity have unceasingly harassed the public; and\r\nhave at length been remembered only by the number of wretched volumes\r\ntheir unhappy industry has produced. Such an author was the Abbé de\r\nMarolles, otherwise a most estimable and ingenious man, and the\r\npatriarch of print-collectors.\r\n\r\nThis Abbé was a most egregious scribbler; and so tormented with violent\r\nfits of printing, that he even printed lists and catalogues of his\r\nfriends. I have even seen at the end of one of his works a list of names\r\nof those persons who had given him books. He printed his works at his\r\nown expense, as the booksellers had unanimously decreed this. Menage\r\nused to say of his works, \"The reason why I esteem the productions of\r\nthe Abbé is, for the singular neatness of their bindings; he embellishes\r\nthem so beautifully, that the eye finds pleasure in them.\" On a book of\r\nhis versions of the Epigrams of Martial, this critic wrote, _Epigrams\r\nagainst Martial._ Latterly, for want of employment, our Abbé began a\r\ntranslation of the Bible; but having inserted the notes of the\r\nvisionary Isaac de la Peyrere, the work was burnt by order of the\r\necclesiastical court. He was also an abundant writer in verse, and\r\nexultingly told a poet, that his verses cost him little: \"They cost you\r\nwhat they are worth,\" replied the sarcastic critic. De Marolles in his\r\n_Memoirs_ bitterly complains of the injustice done to him by his\r\ncontemporaries; and says, that in spite of the little favour shown to\r\nhim by the public, he has nevertheless published, by an accurate\r\ncalculation, one hundred and thirty-three thousand one hundred and\r\ntwenty-four verses! Yet this was not the heaviest of his literary sins.\r\nHe is a proof that a translator may perfectly understand the language of\r\nhis original, and yet produce an unreadable translation.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of his life this unlucky author had not been without\r\nambition; it was only when disappointed in his political projects that\r\nhe resolved to devote himself to literature. As he was incapable of\r\nattempting original composition, he became known by his detestable\r\nversions. He wrote above eighty volumes, which have never found favour\r\nin the eyes of the critics; yet his translations are not without their\r\nuse, though they never retain by any chance a single passage of the\r\nspirit of their originals.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable anecdote respecting these translations is, that\r\nwhenever this honest translator came to a difficult passage, he wrote in\r\nthe margin, \"I have not translated this passage, because it is very\r\ndifficult, and in truth I could never understand it.\" He persisted to\r\nthe last in his uninterrupted amusement of printing books; and his\r\nreaders having long ceased, he was compelled to present them to his\r\nfriends, who, probably, were not his readers. After a literary existence\r\nof forty years, he gave the public a work not destitute of entertainment\r\nin his own Memoirs, which he dedicated to his relations and all his\r\nillustrious friends. The singular postscript to his Epistle Dedicatory\r\ncontains excellent advice for authors.\r\n\r\n\"I have omitted to tell you, that I do not advise any one of my\r\nrelatives or friends to apply himself as I have done to study, and\r\nparticularly to the composition of books, if he thinks that will add to\r\nhis fame or fortune. I am persuaded that of all persons in the kingdom,\r\nnone are more neglected than those who devote themselves entirely to\r\nliterature. The small, number of successful persons in that class (at\r\npresent I do not recollect more than two or three) should not impose on\r\none's understanding, nor any consequences from them be drawn in favour\r\nof others. I know how it is by my own experience, and by that of several\r\namongst you, as well as by many who are now no more, and with whom I was\r\nacquainted. Believe me, gentlemen! to pretend to the favours of fortune\r\nit is only necessary to render one's self useful, and to be supple and\r\nobsequious to those who are in possession of credit and authority; to be\r\nhandsome in one's person; to adulate the powerful; to smile, while you\r\nsuffer from them every kind of ridicule and contempt whenever they shall\r\ndo you the honour to amuse themselves with you; never to be frightened\r\nat a thousand obstacles which may be opposed to one; have a face of\r\nbrass and a heart of stone; insult worthy men who are persecuted; rarely\r\nventure to speak the truth; appear devout, with every nice scruple of\r\nreligion, while at the same time every duty must be abandoned when it\r\nclashes with your interest. After these any other accomplishment is\r\nindeed superfluous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYSTERIES, MORALITIES, FARCES, AND SOTTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the theatrical representations of the ancients has been\r\ntraced back to a Grecian stroller singing in a cart to the honour of\r\nBacchus. Our European exhibitions, perhaps as rude in their\r\ncommencement, were likewise for a long time devoted to pious purposes,\r\nunder the titles of Mysteries and Moralities. Of these primeval\r\ncompositions of the drama of modern Europe, I have collected some\r\nanecdotes and some specimens.[96]\r\n\r\nIt appears that pilgrims introduced these devout spectacles. Those who\r\nreturned from the Holy Land or other consecrated places composed\r\ncanticles of their travels, and amused their religious fancies by\r\ninterweaving scenes of which Christ, the Apostles, and other objects of\r\ndevotion, served as the themes. Menestrier informs us that these\r\npilgrims travelled in troops, and stood in the public streets, where\r\nthey recited their poems, with their staff in hand; while their chaplets\r\nand cloaks, covered with shells and images of various colours formed a\r\npicturesque exhibition, which at length excited the piety of the\r\ncitizens to erect occasionally a stage on an extensive spot of ground.\r\nThese spectacles served as the amusements and instruction of the people.\r\nSo attractive were these gross exhibitions in the middle ages, that they\r\nformed one of the principal ornaments of the reception of princes on\r\ntheir public entrances.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mysteries were performed at a more improved period, the actors\r\nwere distinguished characters, and frequently consisted of the\r\necclesiastics of the neighbouring villages, who incorporated themselves\r\nunder the title of _Confrères de la Passion_. Their productions were\r\ndivided, not into acts, but into different days of performance, and they\r\nwere performed in the open plain. This was at least conformable to the\r\ncritical precept of that mad knight whose opinion is noticed by Pope. It\r\nappears by a MS. in the Harleian library, that they were thought to\r\ncontribute so much to the information and instruction of the people,\r\nthat one of the Popes granted a pardon of one thousand days to every\r\nperson who resorted peaceably to the plays performed in the Whitsun week\r\nat Chester, beginning with \"The Creation,\" and ending with the \"General\r\nJudgment.\" These were performed at the expense of the different\r\ncorporations of that city, and the reader may smile at the ludicrous\r\ncombinations. \"The Creation\" was performed by the Drapers; the \"Deluge\"\r\nby the Dyers; \"Abraham, Melchisedech, and Lot,\" by the Barbers; \"The\r\nPurification\" by the Blacksmiths; \"The Last Supper\" by the Bakers; the\r\n\"Resurrection\" by the Skinners; and the \"Ascension\" by the Tailors. In\r\nthese pieces the actors represented the person of the Almighty without\r\nbeing sensible of the gross impiety. So unskilful were they in this\r\ninfancy of the theatrical art, that very serious consequences were\r\nproduced by their ridiculous blunders and ill-managed machinery. The\r\nfollowing singular anecdotes are preserved, concerning a Mystery which\r\ntook up several days in the performance.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1437, when Conrad Bayer, Bishop of Metz, caused the Mystery\r\nof 'The Passion' to be represented on the plain of Veximel near that\r\ncity, _God_ was _an old gentleman_, named Mr. Nicholas Neufchatel, of\r\nTouraine, curate of Saint Victory, of Metz, and who was very near\r\nexpiring on the cross had he not been timely assisted. He was so\r\nenfeebled, that it was agreed another priest should be placed on the\r\ncross the next day, to finish the representation of the person\r\ncrucified, and which was done; at the same time Mr. Nicholas undertook\r\nto perform 'The Resurrection,' which being a less difficult task, he did\r\nit admirably well.\"--Another priest, whose name was Mr. John de Nicey,\r\ncurate of Metrange, personated Judas, and he had like to have been\r\nstifled while he hung on the tree, for his neck slipped; this being at\r\nlength luckily perceived, he was quickly cut down and recovered.\r\n\r\nJohn Bouchet, in his \"Annales d'Aquitaine,\" a work which contains many\r\ncurious circumstances of the times, written with that agreeable\r\nsimplicity which characterises the old writers, informs us, that in 1486\r\nhe saw played and exhibited in Mysteries by persons of Poitiers, \"The\r\nNativity, Passion, and Resurrection of Christ,\" in great triumph and\r\nsplendour; there were assembled on this occasion most of the ladies and\r\ngentlemen of the neighbouring counties.\r\n\r\nWe will now examine the Mysteries themselves. I prefer for this purpose\r\nto give a specimen from the French, which are livelier than our own. It\r\nis necessary to premise to the reader, that my versions being in prose\r\nwill probably lose much of that quaint expression and vulgar _naïveté_\r\nwhich prevail through the originals, written in octo-syllabic verses.\r\n\r\nOne of these Mysteries has for its subject the election of an apostle to\r\nsupply the place of the traitor Judas. A dignity so awful is conferred\r\nin the meanest manner; it is done by drawing straws, of which he who\r\ngets the longest becomes the apostle. Louis Chocquet was a favourite\r\ncomposer of these religious performances: when he attempts the\r\npathetic, he has constantly recourse to devils; but, as these characters\r\nare sustained with little propriety, his pathos succeeds in raising a\r\nlaugh. In the following dialogue Annas and Caiaphas are introduced\r\nconversing about St. Peter and St. John:----\r\n\r\n    ANNAS.\r\n    I remember them once very honest people. They have often brought\r\n    their fish to my house to sell.\r\n\r\n    CAIAPHAS.\r\n    Is this true?\r\n\r\n    ANNAS.\r\n    By God, it is true; my servants remember them very well. To live\r\n    more at their ease they have left off business; or perhaps they were in\r\n    want of customers. Since that time they have followed Jesus, that\r\n    wicked heretic, who has taught them magic; the fellow understands\r\n    necromancy, and is the greatest magician alive, as far as Rome itself.\r\n\r\nSt. John, attacked by the satellites of Domitian, amongst whom the\r\nauthor has placed Longinus and Patroclus, gives regular answers to their\r\ninsulting interrogatories. Some of these I shall transcribe; but leave\r\nto the reader's conjectures the replies of the Saint, which are not\r\ndifficult to anticipate.\r\n\r\n     PARTHEMIA.\r\n\r\n     You tell us strange things, to say there is but one God in three\r\n     persons.\r\n\r\n     LONGINUS.\r\n\r\n     Is it any where said that we must believe your old prophets (with\r\n     whom your memory seems overburdened) to be more perfect than our\r\n     gods?\r\n\r\n     PATHOCLUS. You must be very cunning to maintain impossibilities.\r\n     Now listen to me: Is it possible that a virgin can bring forth a\r\n     child without ceasing to be a virgin?\r\n\r\n     DOMITIAN.\r\n\r\n     Will you not change these foolish sentiments? Would you pervert us?\r\n     Will you not convert yourself? Lords! you perceive now very clearly\r\n     what an obstinate fellow this is! Therefore let him be stripped and\r\n     put into a great caldron of boiling oil. Let him die at the Latin\r\n     Gate.\r\n\r\n     PESART.\r\n\r\n     The great devil of hell fetch me if I don't Latinise him well.\r\n     Never shall they hear at the Latin Gate any one sing so well as he\r\n     shall sing.\r\n\r\n     TORNEAU.\r\n\r\n     I dare venture to say he won't complain of being frozen.\r\n\r\n     PATROCLUS.\r\n\r\n     Frita, run quick; bring wood and coals, and make the caldron ready.\r\n\r\n     FRITA.\r\n\r\n     I promise him, if he has the gout or the itch, he will soon get rid\r\n     of them.\r\n\r\nSt. John dies a perfect martyr, resigned to the boiling oil and gross\r\njests of Patroclus and Longinus. One is astonished in the present times\r\nat the excessive absurdity, and indeed blasphemy, which the writers of\r\nthese Moralities permitted themselves, and, what is more extraordinary,\r\nwere permitted by an audience consisting of a whole town. An extract\r\nfrom the \"Mystery of St. Dennis\" is in the Duke de la Vallière's\r\n\"Bibliothèque du Théâtre François depuis son Origine: Dresde, 1768.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor Domitian, irritated against the Christians, persecutes them,\r\nand thus addresses one of his courtiers:----\r\n\r\n    Seigneurs Romains, j'ai entendu\r\n    Que d'un crucifix d'un pendu,\r\n    On fait un Dieu par notre empire,\r\n    Sans ce qu'on le nous daigne dire.\r\n\r\n    Roman lords, I understand\r\n    That of a crucified hanged man\r\n    They make a God in our kingdom,\r\n    Without even deigning to ask our permission.\r\n\r\nHe then orders an officer to seize on Dennis in France. When this\r\nofficer arrives at Paris, the inhabitants acquaint him of the rapid and\r\ngrotesque progress of this future saint:----\r\n\r\n        Sire, il preche un Dieu à Paris\r\n        Qui fait tout les mouls et les vauls.\r\n        Il va à cheval sans chevauls.\r\n        Il fait et defait tout ensemble.\r\n        Il vit, il meurt, il sue, il tremble.\r\n        Il pleure, il rit, il veille, et dort.\r\n        Il est jeune et vieux, foible et fort.\r\n        Il fait d'un coq une poulette.\r\n        Il joue des arts de roulette,\r\n        Ou je ne Sçais que ce peut être.\r\n\r\n        Sir, he preaches a God at Paris\r\n        Who has made mountain and valley.\r\n        He goes a horseback without horses.\r\n        He does and undoes at once.\r\n        He lives, he dies, he sweats, he trembles.\r\n        He weeps, he laughs, he wakes, and sleeps.\r\n        He is young and old, weak and strong.\r\n        He turns a cock into a hen.\r\n        He knows how to conjure with cup and ball,\r\n        Or I do not know who this can be.\r\n\r\nAnother of these admirers says, evidently alluding to the rite of\r\nbaptism,----\r\n\r\n    Sire, oyez que fait ce fol prestre:\r\n    Il prend de l'yaue en une escuele,\r\n    Et gete aux gens sur le cervele,\r\n    Et dit que partants sont sauvés!\r\n\r\n    Sir, hear what this mad priest does:\r\n    He takes water out of a ladle,\r\n    And, throwing it at people's heads,\r\n    He says that when they depart they are saved!\r\n\r\nThis piece then proceeds to entertain the spectators with the tortures\r\nof St. Dennis, and at length, when more than dead, they mercifully\r\nbehead him: the Saint, after his decapitation, rises very quietly, takes\r\nhis head under his arm, and walks off the stage in all the dignity of\r\nmartyrdom.\r\n\r\nIt is justly observed by Bayle on these wretched representations, that\r\nwhile they prohibited the people from meditating on the sacred history\r\nin the book which contains it in all its purity and truth, they\r\npermitted them to see it on the theatre sullied with a thousand gross\r\ninventions, which were expressed in the most vulgar manner and in a\r\nfarcical style. Warton, with his usual elegance, observes, \"To those who\r\nare accustomed to contemplate the great picture of human follies which\r\nthe unpolished ages of Europe hold up to our view, it will not appear\r\nsurprising that the people who were forbidden to read the events of the\r\nsacred history in the Bible, in which they are faithfully and\r\nbeautifully related, should at the same time be permitted to see them\r\nrepresented on the stage disgraced with the grossest improprieties,\r\ncorrupted with inventions and additions of the most ridiculous kind,\r\nsullied with impurities, and expressed in the language and\r\ngesticulations of the lowest farce.\" Elsewhere he philosophically\r\nobserves that, however, they had their use, \"not only teaching the great\r\ntruths of scripture to men who could not read the Bible, but in\r\nabolishing the barbarous attachment to military games and the bloody\r\ncontentions of the tournament, which had so long prevailed as the sole\r\nspecies of popular amusement. Rude, and even ridiculous as they were,\r\nthey softened the manners of the people, by diverting the public\r\nattention to spectacles in which the mind was concerned, and by creating\r\na regard for other arts than those of bodily strength and savage\r\nvalour.\"\r\n\r\n_Mysteries_ are to be distinguished from _Moralities_, and _Farces_, and\r\n_Sotties_. _Moralities_ are dialogues where the interlocutors\r\nrepresented feigned or allegorical personages. _Farces_ were more\r\nexactly what their title indicates--obscene, gross, and dissolute\r\nrepresentations, where both the actions and words are alike\r\nreprehensible.\r\n\r\nThe _Sotties_ were more farcical than farce, and frequently had the\r\nlicentiousness of pasquinades. I shall give an ingenious specimen of one\r\nof the MORALITIES. This Morality is entitled, \"The Condemnation of\r\nFeasts, to the Praise of Diet and Sobriety for the Benefit of the Human\r\nBody.\"\r\n\r\nThe perils of gormandising form the present subject. Towards the close\r\nis a trial between _Feasting_ and _Supper_. They are summoned before\r\n_Experience_, the Lord Chief Justice! _Feasting_ and _Supper_ are\r\naccused of having murdered four persons by force of gorging them.\r\n_Experience_ condemns _Feasting_ to the gallows; and his executioner is\r\n_Diet_. _Feasting_ asks for a father-confessor, and makes a public\r\nconfession of so many crimes, such numerous convulsions, apoplexies,\r\nhead-aches, and stomach-qualms, &c., which he has occasioned, that his\r\nexecutioner _Diet_ in a rage stops his mouth, puts the cord about his\r\nneck, and strangles him. _Supper_ is only condemned to load his hands\r\nwith a certain quantity of lead, to hinder him from putting too many\r\ndishes on table: he is also bound over to remain at the distance of six\r\nhours' walking from _Dinner_ upon pain of death. _Supper_ felicitates\r\nhimself on his escape, and swears to observe the mitigated sentence.[97]\r\n\r\nThe MORALITIES were allegorical dramas, whose tediousness seems to have\r\ndelighted a barbarous people not yet accustomed to perceive that what\r\nwas obvious might be omitted to great advantage: like children,\r\neverything must be told in such an age; their own unexercised\r\nimagination cannot supply anything.\r\n\r\nOf the FARCES the licentiousness is extreme, but their pleasantry and\r\ntheir humour are not contemptible. The \"Village Lawyer,\" which is never\r\nexhibited on our stage without producing the broadest mirth, originates\r\namong these ancient drolleries. The humorous incident of the shepherd,\r\nwho having stolen his master's sheep, is advised by his lawyer only to\r\nreply to his judge by mimicking the bleating of a sheep, and when the\r\nlawyer in return claims his fee, pays him by no other coin, is\r\ndiscovered in these ancient farces. Bruèys got up the ancient farce of\r\nthe \"_Patelin_\" in 1702, and we borrowed it from him.\r\n\r\nThey had another species of drama still broader than Farce, and more\r\nstrongly featured by the grossness, the severity, and personality of\r\nsatire:--these were called _Sotties_, of which the following one I find\r\nin the Duke de la Vallière's \"Bibliothèque du Théâtre François.\"[98]\r\n\r\nThe actors come on the stage with their fools'-caps each wanting the\r\nright ear, and begin with stringing satirical proverbs, till, after\r\ndrinking freely, they discover that their fools'-caps want the right\r\near. They call on their old grandmother _Sottie_ (or Folly), who advises\r\nthem to take up some trade. She introduces this progeny of her fools to\r\nthe _World_, who takes them into his service. The _World_ tries their\r\nskill, and is much displeased with their work. The _Cobbler_-fool\r\npinches his feet by making the shoes too small; the _Tailor_-fool hangs\r\nhis coat too loose or too tight about him; the _Priest_-fool says his\r\nmasses either too short or too tedious. They all agree that the _World_\r\ndoes not know what he wants, and must be sick, and prevail upon him to\r\nconsult a physician. The _World_ obligingly sends what is required to a\r\nUrine-doctor, who instantly pronounces that \"the _World_ is as mad as a\r\nMarch hare!\" He comes to visit his patient, and puts a great many\r\nquestions on his unhappy state. The _World_ replies, \"that what most\r\ntroubles his head is the idea of a new deluge by fire, which must one\r\nday consume him to a powder;\" on which the physician gives this\r\nanswer:----\r\n\r\n    Et te troubles-tu pour cela?\r\n    Monde, tu ne te troubles pas\r\n    De voir ce larrons attrapars\r\n    Vendre et acheter benefices;\r\n    Les enfans en bras des Nourices\r\n    Estre Abbés, Eveques, Prieurs,\r\n    Chevaucher tres bien les deux soeurs,\r\n    Tuer les gens pour leurs plaisirs,\r\n    Jouer le leur, l'autrui saisir,\r\n    Donner aux flatteurs audience,\r\n    Faire la guerre à toute outrance\r\n    Pour un rien entre les chrestiens!\r\n\r\n    And you really trouble yourself about this?\r\n    Oh, _World!_ you do not trouble yourself about\r\n    Seeing those impudent rascals\r\n    Selling and buying livings;\r\n    Children in the arms of their nurses\r\n    Made Abbots, Bishops, and Priors,\r\n    Intriguing with girls,\r\n    Killing people for their pleasures,\r\n    Minding their own interests, and seizing on what belongs to another,\r\n    Lending their ears to flatterers,\r\n    Making war, exterminating war,\r\n    For a bubble, among Christians!\r\n\r\nThe _World_ takes leave of his physician, but retains his advice; and to\r\ncure his fits of melancholy gives himself up entirely to the direction\r\nof his fools. In a word, the _World_ dresses himself in the coat and cap\r\nof _Folly_, and he becomes as gay and ridiculous as the rest of the\r\nfools.\r\n\r\nThis _Sottie_ was represented in the year 1524.\r\n\r\nSuch was the rage for Mysteries, that René d'Anjou, king of Naples and\r\nSicily, and Count of Provence, had them magnificently represented and\r\nmade them a serious concern. Being in Provence, and having received\r\nletters from his son the Prince of Calabria, who asked him for an\r\nimmediate aid of men, he replied, that \"he had a very different matter\r\nin hand, for he was fully employed in settling the order of a\r\nMystery--_in honour of God_.\"[99]\r\n\r\nStrutt, in his \"Manners and Customs of the English,\" has given a\r\ndescription of the stage in England when Mysteries were the only\r\ntheatrical performances. Vol. iii, p. 130.\r\n\r\n\"In the early dawn of literature, and when the sacred Mysteries were the\r\nonly theatrical performances, what is now called the stage did then\r\nconsist of three several platforms, or stages raised one above another.\r\nOn the uppermost sat the _Pater Coelestis_, surrounded with his Angels;\r\non the second appeared the Holy Saints, and glorified men; and the last\r\nand lowest was occupied by mere men who had not yet passed from this\r\ntransitory life to the regions of eternity. On one side of this lowest\r\nplatform was the resemblance of a dark pitchy cavern, from whence issued\r\nappearance of fire and flames; and, when it was necessary, the audience\r\nwere treated with hideous yellings and noises as imitative of the\r\nhowlings and cries of the wretched souls tormented by the relentless\r\ndemons. From this yawning cave the devils themselves constantly ascended\r\nto delight and to instruct the spectators:--to delight, because they\r\nwere usually the greatest jesters and buffoons that then appeared; and\r\nto instruct, for that they treated the wretched mortals who were\r\ndelivered to them with the utmost cruelty, warning thereby all men\r\ncarefully to avoid the falling into the clutches of such hardened and\r\nremorseless spirits.\" An anecdote relating to an English Mystery\r\npresents a curious specimen of the manners of our country, which then\r\ncould admit of such a representation; the simplicity, if not the\r\nlibertinism, of the age was great. A play was acted in one of the\r\nprincipal cities of England, under the direction of the trading\r\ncompanies of that city, before a numerous assembly of both sexes,\r\nwherein _Adam_ and _Eve_ appeared on the stage entirely naked, performed\r\ntheir whole part in the representation of Eden, to the serpent's\r\ntemptation, to the eating of the forbidden fruit, the perceiving of, and\r\nconversing about, their nakedness, and to the supplying of fig-leaves to\r\ncover it. Warton observes they had the authority of scripture for such a\r\nrepresentation, and they gave matters just as they found them in the\r\nthird chapter of Genesis. The following article will afford the reader a\r\nspecimen of an _Elegant Morality_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE AND FOLLY, AN ANCIENT MORALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most elegant Moralities was composed by Louise L'Abé; the\r\nAspasia of Lyons in 1550, adored by her contemporaries. With no\r\nextraordinary beauty, she however displayed the fascination of classical\r\nlearning, and a vein of vernacular poetry refined and fanciful. To\r\naccomplishments so various she added the singular one of distinguishing\r\nherself by a military spirit, and was nicknamed Captain Louise. She was\r\na fine rider and a fine lutanist. She presided in the assemblies of\r\npersons of literature and distinction. Married to a rope-manufacturer,\r\nshe was called _La belle Cordière_, and her name is still perpetuated by\r\nthat of the street she lived in. Her anagram was _Belle à Soy_.--But she\r\nwas _belle_ also for others. Her _Morals_ in one point were not correct,\r\nbut her taste was never gross: the ashes of her perishable graces may\r\npreserve themselves sacred from our severity; but the productions of her\r\ngenius may still delight.\r\n\r\nHer Morality, entitled \"Débat de Folie et d'Amour--the Contest of _Love_\r\nand _Folly_,\" is divided into five parts, and contains six mythological\r\nor allegorical personages. This division resembles our five acts, which,\r\nsoon after the publication of this Morality, became generally practised.\r\n\r\nIn the first part, _Love_ and _Folly_ arrive at the same moment at the\r\ngate of Jupiter's palace, to join a festival to which he had invited the\r\ngods. _Folly_ observing _Love_ just going to step in at the hall, pushes\r\nhim aside and enters first. _Love_ is enraged, but _Folly_ insists on\r\nher precedency. _Love_, perceiving there was no reasoning with _Folly_,\r\nbends his bow and shoots an arrow; but she baffled his attempt by\r\nrendering herself invisible. She in her turn becomes furious, falls on\r\nthe boy, tearing out his eyes, and then covers them with a bandage which\r\ncould not be taken off.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, _Love_, in despair for having lost his sight,\r\nimplores the assistance of his mother; she tries in vain to undo the\r\nmagic fillet; the knots are never to be unloosed.\r\n\r\nIn the third part, Venus presents herself at the foot of the throne of\r\nJupiter to complain of the outrage committed by _Folly_ on her son.\r\nJupiter commands _Folly_ to appear.--She replies, that though she has\r\nreason to justify herself, she will not venture to plead her cause, as\r\nshe is apt to speak too much, or to omit what should be said. _Folly_\r\nasks for a counsellor, and chooses Mercury; Apollo is selected by\r\nVenus. The fourth part consists of a long dissertation between Jupiter\r\nand _Love_, on the manner of loving. _Love_ advises Jupiter, if he\r\nwishes to taste of truest happiness, to descend on earth, to lay down\r\nall his majesty, and, in the figure of a mere mortal, to please some\r\nbeautiful maiden: \"Then wilt thou feel quite another contentment than\r\nthat thou hast hitherto enjoyed: instead of a single pleasure it will be\r\ndoubled; for there is as much pleasure to be loved as to love.\" Jupiter\r\nagrees that this may be true, but he thinks that to attain this it\r\nrequires too much time, too much trouble, too many attentions,--and\r\nthat, after all, it is not worth them.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth part, Apollo, the advocate for Venus, in a long pleading\r\ndemands justice against _Folly_. The Gods, seduced by his eloquence,\r\nshow by their indignation that they would condemn _Folly_ without\r\nhearing her advocate Mercury. But Jupiter commands silence, and Mercury\r\nreplies. His pleading is as long as the adverse party's, and his\r\narguments in favour of _Folly_ are so plausible, that, when he concludes\r\nhis address, the gods are divided in opinion; some espouse the cause of\r\n_Love_, and some, that of _Folly_. Jupiter, after trying in vain to make\r\nthem agree together, pronounces this award:----\r\n\r\n\"On account of the difficulty and importance of your disputes and the\r\ndiversity of your opinions, we have suspended your contest from this day\r\nto three times seven times nine centuries. In the mean time we command\r\nyou to live amicably together without injuring one another. _Folly_\r\nshall lead _Love,_ and take him whithersoever he pleases, and when\r\nrestored to his sight, the Fates may pronounce sentence.\"\r\n\r\nMany beautiful conceptions are scattered in this elegant Morality. It\r\nhas given birth to subsequent imitations; it was too original and\r\nplayful an idea not to be appropriated by the poets. To this Morality we\r\nperhaps owe the panegyric of _Folly_ by Erasmus, and the _Love and\r\nFolly_ of La Fontaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS NOUVELLETTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall notice a class of very singular works, in which the spirit of\r\nromance has been called in to render religion more attractive to certain\r\nheated imaginations.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century was published a little book of _prayers_,\r\naccompanied by _figures_, both of a very uncommon nature for a religious\r\npublication. It is entitled _Hortulus Animæ, cum Oratiunculis aliquibus\r\nsuperadditis quæ in prioribus Libris non habentur_.\r\n\r\nIt is a small octavo _en lettres gothiques_, printed by John Grunninger,\r\n1500. \"A garden,\" says the author, \"which abounds with flowers for the\r\npleasure of the soul;\" but they are full of poison. In spite of his fine\r\npromises, the chief part of these meditations are as puerile as they are\r\nsuperstitious. This we might excuse, because the ignorance and\r\nsuperstition of the times allowed such things: but the _figures_ which\r\naccompany this work are to be condemned in all ages; one represents\r\nSaint Ursula and some of her eleven thousand virgins, with all the\r\nlicentious inventions of an Aretine. What strikes the ear does not so\r\nmuch irritate the senses, observes the sage Horace, as what is presented\r\nin all its nudity to the eye. One of these designs is only ridiculous:\r\nDavid is represented as examining Bathsheba bathing, while Cupid\r\nhovering throws his dart, and with a malicious smile triumphs in his\r\nsuccess. We have had many gross anachronisms in similar designs. There\r\nis a laughable picture in a village in Holland, in which Abraham appears\r\nready to sacrifice his son Isaac by a loaded blunderbuss; but his pious\r\nintention is entirely frustrated by an angel urining in the pan. In\r\nanother painting, the Virgin receives the annunciation of the angel\r\nGabriel with a huge chaplet of beads tied round her waist, reading her\r\nown offices, and kneeling before a crucifix; another happy invention, to\r\nbe seen on an altar-piece at Worms, is that in which the Virgin throws\r\nJesus into the hopper of a mill, while from the other side he issues\r\nchanged into little morsels of bread, with which the priests feast the\r\npeople. Matthison, a modern traveller, describes a picture in a church\r\nat Constance, called the Conception of the Holy Virgin. An old man lies\r\non a cloud, whence he darts out a vast beam, which passes through a dove\r\nhovering just below; at the end of a beam appears a large transparent\r\negg, in which egg is seen a child in swaddling clothes with a glory\r\nround it. Mary sits leaning in an arm chair, and opens her mouth to\r\nreceive the egg.\r\n\r\nI must not pass unnoticed in this article a production as extravagant in\r\nits design, in which the author prided himself in discussing three\r\nthousand questions concerning the Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\nThe publication now adverted to was not presented to the world in a\r\nbarbarous age and in a barbarous country, but printed at Paris in 1668.\r\nIt bears for title, _Dévote Salutation des Membres sacres du Corps de la\r\nGlorieuse Vièrge, Mère de Dieu_. That is, \"A Devout Salutation of the\r\nHoly Members of the Body of the glorious Virgin, Mother of God.\" It was\r\nprinted and published with an approbation and privilege, which is more\r\nstrange than the work itself. Valois reprobates it in these just terms:\r\n\"What would Innocent XI. have done, after having abolished the shameful\r\n_Office of the Conception, Indulgences, &c._ if he had seen a volume in\r\nwhich the impertinent devotion of that visionary monk caused to be\r\nprinted, with permission of his superiors, Meditations on all the Parts\r\nof the Body of the Holy Virgin? Religion, decency, and good sense, are\r\nequally struck at by such an extravagance.\" I give a specimen of the\r\nmost decent of these _salutations_.\r\n\r\n_Salutation to the Hair._\r\n\r\n\"I salute you, charming hair of Maria! Rays of the mystical sun! Lines\r\nof the centre and circumference of all created perfection! Veins of gold\r\nof the mine of love! Chains of the prison of God! Roots of the tree of\r\nlife! Rivulets of the fountain of Paradise! Strings of the bow of\r\ncharity! Nets that caught Jesus, and shall be used in the hunting-day of\r\nsouls!\"\r\n\r\n_Salutation to the Ears._\r\n\r\n\"I salute ye, intelligent ears of Maria! ye presidents of the princes of\r\nthe poor! Tribunal for their petitions; salvation at the audience of the\r\nmiserable! University of all divine wisdom! Receivers general of all\r\nwards! Ye are pierced with the rings of our chains; ye are impearled\r\nwith our necessities!\"\r\n\r\nThe images, prints, and miniatures, with which the catholic religion has\r\noccasion to decorate its splendid ceremonies, have frequently been\r\nconsecrated to the purposes of love: they have been so many votive\r\nofferings worthy to have been suspended in the temple of Idalia. Pope\r\nAlexander VI. had the images of the Virgin made to represent some of his\r\nmistresses; the famous Vanozza, his favourite, was placed on the altar\r\nof Santa, Maria del Popolo; and Julia Farnese furnished a subject for\r\nanother Virgin. The same genius of pious gallantry also visited our\r\ncountry. The statuaries made the queen of Henry III. a model for the\r\nface of the Virgin Mary. Hearne elsewhere affirms, that the Virgin Mary\r\nwas generally made to bear a resemblance to the queens of the age,\r\nwhich, no doubt, produced some real devotion among the courtiers.\r\n\r\nThe prayer-books of certain pious libertines were decorated with the\r\nportraits of their favourite minions and ladies in the characters of\r\nsaints, and even of the Virgin and Jesus. This scandalous practice was\r\nparticularly prevalent in that reign of debauchery in France, when Henry\r\nIII. held the reins of government with a loose hand. In a missal once\r\nappertaining to the queen of Louis XII. may be seen a mitred ape, giving\r\nits benediction to a man prostrate before it; a keen reproach to the\r\nclergy of that day. Charles V., however pious that emperor affected to\r\nbe, had a missal painted for his mistress by the great Albert Durer, the\r\nborders of which are crowded with extravagant grotesques, consisting of\r\napes, who were sometimes elegantly sportive, giving clysters to one\r\nanother, and in more offensive attitudes, not adapted to heighten the\r\npiety of the Royal Mistress. This missal has two French verses written\r\nby the Emperor himself, who does not seem to have been ashamed of his\r\npresent. The Italians carried this taste to excess. The manners of our\r\ncountry were more rarely tainted with this deplorable licentiousness,\r\nalthough I have observed an innocent tendency towards it, by examining\r\nthe illuminated manuscripts of our ancient metrical romances: while we\r\nadmire the vivid colouring of these splendid manuscripts, the curious\r\nobserver will perceive that almost every heroine is represented in a\r\nstate which appears incompatible with her reputation. Most of these\r\nworks are, I believe, by French artists.\r\n\r\nA supplement might be formed to religious indecencies from the Golden\r\nLegend, which abounds in them. Henry Stephens's Apology for Herodotus\r\nmight be likewise consulted with effect for the same purpose. There is a\r\nstory of St. Mary the Egyptian, who was perhaps a looser liver than Mary\r\nMagdalen; for not being able to pay for her passage to Jerusalem,\r\nwhither she was going to adore the holy cross and sepulchre, in despair\r\nshe thought of an expedient in lieu of payment to the ferryman, which\r\nrequired at least going twice, instead of once, to Jerusalem as a\r\npenitential pilgrimage. This anecdote presents the genuine character of\r\ncertain _devotees_.\r\n\r\nMelchior Inchoffer, a Jesuit, published a book to vindicate the miracle\r\nof a _Letter_ which the Virgin Mary had addressed to the citizens of\r\nMessina: when Naudé brought him positive proofs of its evident forgery,\r\nInchoffer ingenuously confessed the imposture, but pleaded that it was\r\ndone by the _orders_ of his _superiors_.\r\n\r\nThis same _letter_ of the Virgin Mary was like a _donation_ made to her\r\nby Louis the Eleventh of the _whole county_ of Boulogne, retaining,\r\nhowever, for _his own use the revenues_! This solemn act bears the date\r\nof the year 1478, and is entitled, \"Conveyance of Louis the Eleventh to\r\nthe Virgin of Boulogne, of the right and title of the fief and homage of\r\nthe county of Boulogne, which is held by the Count of Saint Pol, to\r\nrender a faithful account before the image of the said lady.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Agreda, a religious visionary, wrote _The Life of the Virgin_. She\r\ninforms us that she resisted the commands of God and the holy Mary till\r\nthe year 1637, when she began to compose this curious rhapsody. When she\r\nhad finished this _original_ production, her confessor advised her to\r\n_burn_ it; she obeyed. Her friends, however, who did not think her less\r\ninspired than she informed them she was, advised her to re-write the\r\nwork. When printed it spread rapidly from country to country: new\r\neditions appeared at Lisbon, Madrid, Perpignan, and Antwerp. It was the\r\nrose of Sharon for those climates. There are so many pious absurdities\r\nin this book, which were found to give such pleasure to the devout, that\r\nit was solemnly honoured with the censure of the Sorbonne; and it spread\r\nthe more.\r\n\r\nThe head of this lady was quite turned by her religion. In the first six\r\nchapters she relates the visions of the Virgin, which induced her to\r\nwrite her life. She begins the history _ab ovo_, as it may be expressed;\r\nfor she has formed a narrative of what passed during the nine months in\r\nwhich the Virgin was confined in the womb of her mother St. Anne. After\r\nthe birth of Mary, she received an augmentation of angelic guards; we\r\nhave several conversations which God held with the Virgin during the\r\nfirst eighteen months after her birth. And it is in this manner she\r\nformed a _circulating novel_, which delighted the female devotees of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe worship paid to the Virgin Mary in Spain and Italy exceeds that\r\nwhich is given to the Son or the Father. When they pray to Mary, their\r\nimagination pictures a beautiful woman, they really feel a _passion_;\r\nwhile Jesus is only regarded as a _Bambino_, or infant at the breast,\r\nand the _Father_ is hardly ever recollected: but the _Madonna la\r\nSenhora, la Maria Santa_, while she inspires their religious\r\ninclinations, is a mistress to those who have none.\r\n\r\nOf similar works there exists an entire race, and the libraries of the\r\ncurious may yet preserve a shelf of these religious _nouvellettes_. The\r\nJesuits were the usual authors of these rhapsodies. I find an account of\r\na book which pretends to describe what passes in Paradise. A Spanish\r\nJesuit published at Salamanca a volume in folio, 1652, entitled\r\n_Empyreologia_. He dwells with great complacency on the joys of the\r\ncelestial abode; there always will be music in heaven with material\r\ninstruments as our ears are already accustomed to; otherwise he thinks\r\nthe celestial music would not be music for us! But another Jesuit is\r\nmore particular in his accounts. He positively assures us that we shall\r\nexperience a supreme pleasure in kissing and embracing the bodies of the\r\nblessed; they will bathe in the presence of each other, and for this\r\npurpose there are most agreeable baths in which we shall swim like fish;\r\nthat we shall all warble as sweetly as larks and nightingales; that the\r\nangels will dress themselves in female habits, their hair curled;\r\nwearing petticoats and fardingales, and with the finest linen; that men\r\nand women will amuse themselves in masquerades, feasts, and\r\nballs.--Women will sing more agreeably than men to heighten these\r\nentertainments, and at the resurrection will have more luxuriant\r\ntresses, ornamented with ribands and head-dresses as in this life!\r\n\r\nSuch were the books once so devoutly studied, and which doubtless were\r\noften literally understood. How very bold must the minds of the Jesuits\r\nhave been, and how very humble those of their readers, that such\r\nextravagances should ever be published! And yet, even to the time in\r\nwhich I am now writing,--even at this day,--the same picturesque and\r\nimpassioned pencil is employed by the modern Apostles of Mysticism--the\r\nSwedenborgians, the Moravians, the Methodists!\r\n\r\nI find an account of another book of this class, ridiculous enough to be\r\nnoticed. It has for title, \"The Spiritual Kalendar, composed of as many\r\nMadrigals or Sonnets and Epigrams as there are days in the year;\r\nwritten for the consolation of the pious and the curious. By Father G.\r\nCortade, Austin Preacher at Bayonne, 1665.\" To give a notion of this\r\nsingular collection take an Epigram addressed to a Jesuit, who, young as\r\nhe was, used to _put spurs under his shirt_ to mortify the outer man!\r\nThe Kalendar-poet thus gives a point to these spurs:--\r\n\r\n    Il ne pourra done plus ni ruer ni hennir\r\n    Sous le rude Eperon dont tu fais son supplice;\r\n    Qui vit jamais tel artifice,\r\n    De piquer un cheval pour le mieux retenir!\r\n\r\n    HUMBLY INTIMATED.\r\n\r\n    Your body no more will neigh and will kick,\r\n    The point of the spur must eternally prick;\r\n    Whoever contrived a thing with such skill,\r\n    To keep spurring a horse to make him stand still!\r\n\r\nOne of the most extravagant works projected on the subject of the Virgin\r\nMary was the following:--The prior of a convent in Paris had\r\nreiteratedly entreated Varillas the historian to examine a work composed\r\nby one of the monks; and of which--not being himself addicted to\r\nletters--he wished to be governed by his opinion. Varillas at length\r\nyielded to the entreaties of the prior; and to regale the critic, they\r\nlaid on two tables for his inspection seven enormous volumes in folio.\r\n\r\nThis rather disheartened our reviewer: but greater was his astonishment,\r\nwhen, having opened the first volume, he found its title to be _Summa\r\nDei-paræ_; and as Saint Thomas had made a _Sum_, or System of Theology,\r\nso our monk had formed a _System_ of the _Virgin_! He immediately\r\ncomprehended the design of our good father, who had laboured on this\r\nwork full thirty years, and who boasted he had treated _Three Thousand_\r\nQuestions concerning the Virgin! of which he flattered himself not a\r\nsingle one had ever yet been imagined by any one but himself!\r\n\r\nPerhaps a more extraordinary design was never known. Varillas, pressed\r\nto give his judgment on this work, advised the prior with great prudence\r\nand good-nature to amuse the honest old monk with the hope of printing\r\nthese seven folios, but always to start some new difficulties; for it\r\nwould be inhuman to occasion so deep a chagrin to a man who had reached\r\nhis seventy-fourth year, as to inform him of the nature of his favourite\r\noccupations; and that after his death he should throw the seven folios\r\ninto the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: Since this article was written, many of these ancient\r\nMysteries and Moralities have been printed at home and abroad. Hone, in\r\nhis \"Ancient Mysteries Described,\" 1825, first gave a summary of the\r\n_Ludus Coventriæ,_ the famous mysteries performed by the trading\r\ncompanies of Coventry; the entire series have been since printed by the\r\nShakspeare Society, under the editorship of Mr. Halliwell, and consist\r\nof forty-two dramas, founded on incidents in the Old and New Testaments.\r\nThe equally famous _Chester Mysteries_ were also printed by the same\r\nsociety under the editorship of Mr. Wright, and consist of twenty-five\r\nlong dramas, commencing with \"The Fall of Lucifer,\" and ending with\r\n\"Doomsday.\" In 1834, the Abbotsford Club published some others from the\r\nDigby MS., in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. In 1825, Mr. Sharp, of\r\nCoventry, published a dissertation on the Mysteries once performed\r\nthere, and printed the Pageant of the Sheremen and Taylor's Company; and\r\nin 1836 the Abbotsford Club printed the Pageant played by the Weavers of\r\nthat city. In 1836, the Surtees Society published the series known as\r\n_The Towneley Mysteries,_ consisting of thirty-two dramas; in 1838, Dr.\r\nMarriott published in English, at Basle, a selection of the most curious\r\nof these dramas. In 1837, M. Achille Jubinal published two octavo\r\nvolumes of French \"Mystères inédits du Quinzième Siècle.\" This list\r\nmight be swelled by other notes of such books, printed within the last\r\nthirty years, in illustration of these early religious dramas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: In Jubinal's _Tapisseries Anciennes_ is engraved that\r\nfound in the tent of Charles the Bold, at Nancy, and still preserved in\r\nthat city. It is particularly curious, inasmuch as it depicts the\r\nincidents described in the Morality above-named.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: The British Museum library was enriched in 1845 by a very\r\ncurions collection of these old comic plays, which was formed about\r\n1560. It consists of sixty-four dramas, of which number only five or six\r\nwere known before. They are exceedingly curious as pictures of early\r\nmanners and amusements; very simple in construction, and containing few\r\ncharacters. One is a comic dialogue between two persons as to the best\r\nway of managing a wife. Another has for its plot the adventure of a\r\nhusband sent from home by the seigneur of the village, that he may\r\nobtain access to his wife; and who is checkmated by the peasant, who\r\nrepairs to the neglected lady of the seigneur. Some are entirely\r\ncomposed of allegorical characters; all are broadly comic, in language\r\nequally broad. They were played by a jocular society, whose chief was\r\ntermed Prince des Sots; hence the name Sotties given to the farces.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: The peasants of the Ober-Ammergau, a village in the\r\nBavarian Alps, still perform, at intervals of ten years, a long miracle\r\nplay, detailing the chief incidents of the Passion of our Saviour from\r\nhis entrance into Jerusalem to his ascension. It is done in fulfilment\r\nof a vow made during a pestilence in 1633. The performance lasted twelve\r\nhours in 1850, when it was last performed. The actors were all of the\r\npeasant class.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CRITICAL SAGACITY,\" AND \"HAPPY CONJECTURE;\" OR, BENTLEY'S MILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ----BENTLEY, long to wrangling schools confined,\r\n    And but by books acquainted with mankind----\r\n    To MILTON lending sense, to HORACE wit,\r\n    He makes them write, what never poet writ.\r\n\r\nDR. BENTLEY'S edition of our English Homer is sufficiently known by\r\nname. As it stands a terrifying beacon to conjectural criticism, I shall\r\njust notice some of those violations which the learned critic ventured\r\nto commit, with all the arrogance of a Scaliger. This man, so deeply\r\nversed in ancient learning, it will appear, was destitute of taste and\r\ngenius in his native language.\r\n\r\nOur critic, to persuade the world of the necessity of his edition,\r\nimagined a fictitious editor of Milton's Poems: and it was this\r\ningenuity which produced all his absurdities. As it is certain that the\r\nblind bard employed an amanuensis, it was not improbable that many words\r\nof similar sound, but very different signification, might have\r\ndisfigured the poem; but our Doctor was bold enough to conjecture that\r\nthis amanuensis _interpolated_ whole verses of his own composition in\r\nthe \"Paradise Lost!\" Having laid down this fatal position, all the\r\nconsequences of his folly naturally followed it. Yet if there needs any\r\nconjecture, the more probable one will be, that Milton, who was never\r\ncareless of his future fame, had his poem _read_ to him after it had\r\nbeen published. The first edition appeared in 1667, and the second in\r\n1674, in which all the faults of the former edition are continued. By\r\nthese _faults_, the Doctor means what _he_ considers to be such: for we\r\nshall soon see that his \"Canons of Criticism\" are apocryphal.\r\n\r\nBentley says that he will _supply_ the want of manuscripts to collate\r\n(to use his own words) by his own \"SAGACITY,\" and \"HAPPY CONJECTURE.\"\r\n\r\nMilton, after the conclusion of Satan's speech to the fallen angels,\r\nproceeds thus:--\r\n\r\n    1. He spake: and to confirm his words out flew\r\n    2. Millions of flaming _swords_, drawn from the thighs\r\n    3. Of mighty cherubim: the sudden blaze\r\n    4. Far round illumin'd hell; highly they rag'd\r\n    5. Against the Highest; and fierce with grasped _arms_\r\n    6. Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war,\r\n    7. Hurling defiance tow'rd the _Vault_ of heaven.\r\n\r\nIn this passage, which is as perfect as human wit can make, the Doctor\r\nalters three words. In the second line he puts _blades_ instead of\r\n_swords_; in the fifth he puts _swords_ instead of _arms_; and in the\r\nlast line he prefers _walls_ to _vault_. All these changes are so many\r\ndefoedations of the poem. The word _swords_ is far more poetical than\r\n_blades_, which may as well be understood of _knives_ as _swords_. The\r\nword _arms_, the generic for the specific term, is still stronger and\r\nnobler than _swords_; and the beautiful conception of _vault_, which is\r\nalways indefinite to the eye, while the solidity of _walls_ would but\r\nmeanly describe the highest Heaven, gives an idea of grandeur and\r\nmodesty.\r\n\r\nMilton writes, book i. v. 63--\r\n\r\n    No light, but rather DARKNESS VISIBLE\r\n    Served only to discover sights of woe.\r\n\r\nPerhaps borrowed from Spenser:--\r\n\r\n    A little glooming light, much like a shade.\r\n            _Faery Queene_, b. i. c. 2. st. 14.\r\n\r\nThis fine expression of \"DARKNESS VISIBLE\" the Doctor's critical\r\nsagacity has thus rendered clearer:--\r\n\r\n    No light, but rather A TRANSPICIUOUS GLOOM.\r\n\r\nAgain, our learned critic distinguishes the 74th line of the first\r\nbook--\r\n\r\n    As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole,\r\n\r\nas \"a vicious verse,\" and therefore with \"happy conjecture,\" and no\r\ntaste, thrusts in an entire verse of his own composition--\r\n\r\n    DISTANCE WHICH TO EXPRESS ALL MEASURE FAILS.\r\n\r\nMilton _writes_,\r\n\r\n    Our torments, also, may in length of time\r\n    Become our elements.    B. ii. ver. 274.\r\n\r\nBentley _corrects_--\r\n\r\n    _Then, AS WAS WELL OBSERV'D_ our torments may\r\n    Become our elements.\r\n\r\nA curious instance how the insertion of a single prosaic expression\r\nturns a fine verse into something worse than the vilest prose.\r\n\r\nTo conclude with one more instance of critical emendation: Milton says,\r\nwith an agreeable turn of expression--\r\n\r\n    So parted they; the angel up to heaven,\r\n    From the thick shade; and Adam to his bower.\r\n\r\nBentley \"conjectures\" these two verses to be inaccurate, and in lieu of\r\nthe last writes--\r\n\r\n    ADAM, TO RUMINATE ON PAST DISCOURSE.\r\n\r\nAnd then our erudite critic reasons! as thus:--\r\n\r\nAfter the conversation between the Angel and Adam in the bower, it may\r\nbe well presumed that our first parent waited on his heavenly guest at\r\nhis departure to some little distance from it, till he began to take his\r\nflight towards heaven; and therefore \"sagaciously\" thinks that the poet\r\ncould not with propriety say that the angel parted from the _thick\r\nshade_, that is, the _bower_, to go to heaven. But if Adam attended the\r\nAngel no farther than the door or entrance of the bower, then he\r\nshrewdly asks, \"How Adam could return to his bower if he was never out\r\nof it?\"\r\n\r\nOur editor has made a thousand similar corrections in his edition of\r\nMilton! Some have suspected that the same kind intention which prompted\r\nDryden to persuade Creech to undertake a translation of Horace\r\ninfluenced those who encouraged our Doctor, in thus exercising his\r\n\"sagacity\" and \"happy conjecture\" on the epic of Milton. He is one of\r\nthose learned critics who have happily \"elucidated their author into\r\nobscurity,\" and comes nearest to that \"true conjectural critic\" whose\r\npractice a Portuguese satirist so greatly admired: by which means, if he\r\nbe only followed up by future editors, we might have that immaculate\r\nedition, in which little or nothing should be found of the original!\r\n\r\nI have collected these few instances as not uninteresting to men of\r\ntaste; they may convince us that a scholar may be familiarized to Greek\r\nand Latin, though a stranger to his vernacular literature; and that a\r\nverbal critic may sometimes be successful in his attempts on a _single\r\nword_, though he may be incapable of tasting an _entire sentence_. Let\r\nit also remain as a gibbet on the high roads of literature; that\r\n\"conjectural critics\" as they pass may not forget the unhappy fate of\r\nBentley.\r\n\r\nThe following epigram appeared on this occasion:--\r\n\r\n    ON MILTON'S EXECUTIONER.\r\n\r\n    Did MILTON'S PROSE, O CHARLES! thy death defend?\r\n    A furious foe, unconscious, proves a friend;\r\n    On MILTON'S VERSE does BENTLEY comment? know,\r\n    A weak officious friend becomes a foe.\r\n    While he would seem his author's fame to farther,\r\n    The MURTHEROUS critic has avenged thy MURTHER.\r\n\r\nThe classical learning of Bentley was singular and acute; but the\r\nerudition of words is frequently found not to be allied to the\r\nsensibility of taste.[100]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: An amusing instance of his classical emendations occurs\r\nin the text of Shakspeare. [King Henry IV. pt. 2, act 1, sc. 1.] The\r\npoet speaks of one who\r\n\r\n         \"----woebegone\r\n    Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,\r\n    And would have told him half his Troy was burn'd.\"\r\n\r\nBentley alters the first word of the sentence to a proper name, which is\r\ngiven in the third book of the Iliad, and the second of the Æneid; and\r\nreads the passage thus:--\r\n\r\n         \"----Ucaligon\r\n    Drew Priam's curtain,\" &c.!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA JANSENIST DICTIONARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen L'Advocat published his concise Biographical Dictionary, the\r\nJansenists, the methodists of France, considered it as having been\r\nwritten with a view to depreciate the merit of _their_ friends. The\r\nspirit of party is too soon alarmed. The Abbé Barral undertook a\r\ndictionary devoted to their cause. In this labour, assisted by his good\r\nfriends the Jansenists, he indulged all the impetuosity and acerbity of\r\na splenetic adversary. The Abbé was, however, an able writer; his\r\nanecdotes are numerous and well chosen; and his style is rapid and\r\nglowing. The work bears for title, \"Dictionnaire Historique, Littéraire,\r\net Critique, des Hommes Célèbres,\" 6 vols. 8vo. 1719. It is no unuseful\r\nspeculation to observe in what manner a faction represents those who\r\nhave not been its favourites: for this purpose I select the characters\r\nof Fenelon, Cranmer, and Luther.\r\n\r\nOf Fenelon they write, \"He composed for the instruction of the Dukes of\r\nBurgundy, Anjou, and Berri, several works; amongst others, the\r\nTelemachus--a singular book, which partakes at once of the character of\r\na romance and of a poem, and which substitutes a prosaic cadence for\r\nversification.\"\r\n\r\nBut several luscious pictures would not lead us to suspect that this\r\nbook issued from the pen of a sacred minister for the education of a\r\nprince; and what we are told by a famous poet is not improbable, that\r\nFenelon did not compose it at court, but that it is the fruits of his\r\nretreat in his diocese. And indeed the amours of Calypso and Eucharis\r\nshould not be the first lessons that a minister ought to give his\r\nscholars; and, besides, the fine moral maxims which the author\r\nattributes to the Pagan divinities are not well placed in their mouth.\r\nIs not this rendering homage to the demons of the great truths which we\r\nreceive from the Gospel, and to despoil J. C. to render respectable the\r\nannihilated gods of paganism? This prelate was a wretched divine, more\r\nfamiliar with the light of profane authors than with that of the fathers\r\nof the church. Phelipeaux has given us, in his narrative of Quietism,\r\nthe portrait of the friend of Madame Guyon. This archbishop has a lively\r\ngenius, artful and supple, which can flatter and dissimulate, if ever\r\nany could. Seduced by a woman, he was solicitous to spread his\r\nseduction. He joined to the politeness and elegance of conversation a\r\nmodest air, which rendered him amiable. He spoke of spirituality with\r\nthe expression and the enthusiasm of a prophet; with such talents he\r\nflattered himself that everything would yield to him.\r\n\r\nIn this work the Protestants, particularly the first Reformers, find no\r\nquarter; and thus virulently their rabid catholicism exults over the\r\nhapless end of Cranmer, the first Protestant archbishop:--\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Cranmer married the sister of Osiander. As Henry VIII. detested\r\nmarried priests, Cranmer kept this second marriage in profound secrecy.\r\nThis action serves to show the character of this great reformer, who is\r\nthe hero of Burnet, whose history is so much esteemed in England. What\r\nblindness to suppose him an Athanasius, who was at once a Lutheran\r\nsecretly married, a consecrated archbishop under the Roman pontiff whose\r\npower he detested, saying the mass in which he did not believe, and\r\ngranting a power to say it! The divine vengeance burst on this\r\nsycophantic courtier, who had always prostituted his conscience to his\r\nfortune.\"\r\n\r\nTheir character of Luther is quite Lutheran in one sense, for Luther was\r\nhimself a stranger to moderate strictures:--\r\n\r\n\"The furious Luther, perceiving himself assisted by the credit of\r\nseveral princes, broke loose against the church with the most\r\ninveterate rage, and rung the most terrible alarum against the pope.\r\nAccording to him we should have set fire to everything, and reduced to\r\none heap of ashes the pope and the princes who supported him. Nothing\r\nequals the rage of this phrenetic man, who was not satisfied with\r\nexhaling his fury in horrid declamations, but who was for putting all in\r\npractice. He raised his excesses to the height by inveighing against the\r\nvow of chastity, and in marrying publicly Catherine de Bore, a nun, whom\r\nhe enticed, with eight others, from their convents. He had prepared the\r\nminds of the people for this infamous proceeding by a treatise which he\r\nentitled 'Examples of the Papistical Doctrine and Theology,' in which he\r\ncondemns the praises which all the saints had given to continence. He\r\ndied at length quietly enough, in 1546, at Eisleben, his country\r\nplace--God reserving the terrible effects of his vengeance to another\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nCranmer, who perished at the stake, these fanatic religionists proclaim\r\nas an example of \"divine vengeance;\" but Luther, the true parent of the\r\nReformation, \"died quietly at Eisleben:\" this must have puzzled their\r\nmode of reasoning; but they extricate themselves out of the dilemma by\r\nthe usual way. Their curses are never what the lawyers call \"lapsed\r\nlegacies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUSCRIPTS AND BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be no uninteresting literary speculation to describe the\r\ndifficulties which some of our most favourite works encountered in their\r\nmanuscript state, and even after they had passed through the press.\r\nSterne, when he had finished his first and second volumes of Tristram\r\nShandy, offered them to a bookseller at York for fifty pounds; but was\r\nrefused: he came to town with his MSS.; and he and Robert Dodsley agreed\r\nin a manner of which neither repented.\r\n\r\nThe Rosciad, with all its merit, lay for a considerable time in a\r\ndormant state, till Churchill and his publisher became impatient, and\r\nalmost hopeless of success.--Burn's Justice was disposed of by its\r\nauthor, who was weary of soliciting booksellers to purchase the MS., for\r\na trifle, and it now yields an annual income. Collins burnt his odes\r\nafter indemnifying his publisher. The publication of Dr. Blair's Sermons\r\nwas refused by Strahan, and the \"Essay on the Immutability of Truth,\"\r\nby Dr. Beattie, could find no publisher, and was printed by two friends\r\nof the author, at their joint expense.\r\n\r\n\"The sermon in Tristram Shandy\" (says Sterne, in his preface to his\r\nSermons) \"was printed by itself some years ago, but could find neither\r\npurchasers nor readers.\" When it was inserted in his eccentric work, it\r\nmet with a most favourable reception, and occasioned the others to be\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nJoseph Warton writes, \"When Gray published his exquisite Ode on Eton\r\nCollege, his first publication, little notice was taken of it.\" The\r\nPolyeucte of Corneille, which is now accounted to be his masterpiece,\r\nwhen he read it to the literary assembly held at the Hotel de\r\nRambouillet, was not approved. Voiture came the next day, and in gentle\r\nterms acquainted him with the unfavourable opinion of the critics. Such\r\nill judges were then the most fashionable wits of France!\r\n\r\nIt was with great difficulty that Mrs. Centlivre could get her \"Busy\r\nBody\" performed. Wilks threw down his part with an oath of\r\ndetestation--our comic authoress fell on her knees and wept.--Her tears,\r\nand not her wit, prevailed.\r\n\r\nA pamphlet published in the year 1738, entitled \"A Letter to the Society\r\nof Booksellers, on the Method of forming a true Judgment of the\r\nManuscripts of Authors,\" contains some curious literary intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"We have known books, that in the MS. have been damned, as well as\r\nothers which seem to be so, since, after their appearance in the world,\r\nthey have often lain by neglected. Witness the 'Paradise Lost' of the\r\nfamous Milton, and the Optics of Sir Isaac Newton, which last, 'tis\r\nsaid, had no character or credit here till noticed in France. 'The\r\nHistorical Connection of the Old and New Testament,' by Shuckford, is\r\nalso reported to have been seldom inquired after for about a\r\ntwelvemonth's time; however, it made a shift, though not without some\r\ndifficulty, to creep up to a second edition, and afterwards even to a\r\nthird. And which is another remarkable instance, the manuscript of Dr.\r\nPrideaux's 'Connection' is well known to have been bandied about from\r\nhand to hand among several, at least five or six, of the most eminent\r\nbooksellers, during the space of at least two years, to no purpose, none\r\nof them undertaking to print that excellent work. It lay in obscurity,\r\ntill Archdeacon Echard, the author's friend, strongly recommended it to\r\nTonson. It was purchased, and the publication was very successful.\r\nRobinson Crusoe in manuscript also ran through the whole trade, nor\r\nwould any one print it, though the writer, De Foe, was in good repute as\r\nan author. One bookseller at last, not remarkable for his discernment,\r\nbut for his speculative turn, engaged in this publication. _This_\r\nbookseller got above a thousand guineas by it; and the booksellers are\r\naccumulating money every hour by editions of this work in all shapes.\r\nThe undertaker of the translation of Rapin, after a very considerable\r\npart of the work had been published, was not a little dubious of its\r\nsuccess, and was strongly inclined to drop the design. It proved at last\r\nto be a most profitable literary adventure.\" It is, perhaps, useful to\r\nrecord, that while the fine compositions of genius and the elaborate\r\nlabours of erudition are doomed to encounter these obstacles to fame,\r\nand never are but slightly remunerated, works of another description are\r\nrewarded in the most princely manner; at the recent sale of a\r\nbookseller, the copyright of \"Vyse's Spelling-book\" was sold at the\r\nenormous price of £2200, with an annuity of 50 guineas to the author!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKISH SPY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the defects of the \"Turkish Spy,\" the author has shown\r\none uncommon merit, by having opened a new species of composition, which\r\nhas been pursued by other writers with inferior success, if we except\r\nthe charming \"Persian Letters\" of Montesquieu. The \"Turkish Spy\" is a\r\nbook which has delighted our childhood, and to which we can still recur\r\nwith pleasure. But its ingenious author is unknown to three parts of his\r\nadmirers.\r\n\r\nIn Boswell's \"Life of Johnson\" is this dialogue concerning the writer of\r\nthe \"Turkish Spy.\" \"B.--Pray, Sir, is the 'Turkish Spy' a genuine book?\r\nJ.--No, Sir. Mrs. Mauley, in her 'Life' says, that _her father wrote the\r\ntwo first volumes_; and in another book--'Dunton's Life and Errours,' we\r\nfind that the rest was _written_ by _one Sault_, at two guineas a sheet,\r\nunder the direction of Dr. Midgeley.\"\r\n\r\nI do not know on what authority Mrs. Manley advances that her father was\r\nthe author; but this lady was never nice in detailing facts. Dunton,\r\nindeed, gives some information in a very loose manner. He tells us, p.\r\n242, that it is probable, by reasons which he insinuates, that _one\r\nBradshaw_, a hackney author, was the writer of the \"Turkish Spy.\" This\r\nman probably was engaged by Dr. Midgeley to translate the volumes as\r\nthey appeared, at the rate of 40s. per sheet. On the whole, all this\r\nproves, at least, how little the author was known while the volumes were\r\npublishing, and that he is as little known at present by the extract\r\nfrom Boswell.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious writer of the Turkish Spy is John Paul Marana, an Italian;\r\nso that the Turkish Spy is just as real a personage as Cid Hamet, from\r\nwhom Cervantes says he had his \"History of Don Quixote.\" Marana had been\r\nimprisoned for a political conspiracy; after his release he retired to\r\nMonaco, where he wrote the \"History of the Plot,\" which is said to be\r\nvaluable for many curious particulars. Marana was at once a man of\r\nletters and of the world. He had long wished to reside at Paris; in that\r\nemporium of taste and luxury his talents procured him patrons. It was\r\nduring his residence there that he produced his \"Turkish Spy.\" By this\r\ningenious contrivance he gave the history of the last age. He displays a\r\nrich memory, and a lively imagination; but critics have said that he\r\ntouches everything, and penetrates nothing. His first three volumes\r\ngreatly pleased: the rest are inferior. Plutarch, Seneca, and Pliny,\r\nwere his favourite authors. He lived in philosophical mediocrity; and in\r\nthe last years of his life retired to his native country, where he died\r\nin 1693.\r\n\r\nCharpentier gave the first particulars of this ingenious man. Even in\r\nhis time the volumes were read as they came out, while its author\r\nremained unknown. Charpentier's proof of the author is indisputable; for\r\nhe preserved the following curious certificate, written in Marana's own\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\n\"I, the under-written John Paul Marana, author of a manuscript Italian\r\nvolume, entitled '_L'Esploratore Turco, tomo terzo_,' acknowledge that\r\nMr. Charpentier, appointed by the Lord Chancellor to revise the said\r\nmanuscript, has not granted me his certificate for printing the said\r\nmanuscript, but on condition to rescind four passages. The first\r\nbeginning, &c. By this I promise to suppress from the said manuscript\r\nthe places above marked, so that there shall remain no vestige; since,\r\nwithout agreeing to this, the said certificate would not have been\r\ngranted to me by the said Mr. Charpentier; and for surety of the above,\r\nwhich I acknowledge to be true, and which I promise punctually to\r\nexecute, I have signed the present writing. Paris, 28th September, 1686.\r\n\r\n    \"JOHN PAUL MARANA.\"\r\n\r\nThis paper serves as a curious instance in what manner the censors of\r\nbooks clipped the wings of genius when it was found too daring or\r\nexcursive.\r\n\r\nThese rescindings of the Censor appear to be marked by Marana in the\r\nprinted work. We find more than once chasms, with these words: \"the\r\nbeginning of _this_ letter is wanting in the Italian translation; the\r\n_original_ paper _being torn_.\"\r\n\r\nNo one has yet taken the pains to observe the date of the first editions\r\nof the French and the English Turkish Spies, which would settle the\r\ndisputed origin. It appears by the document before us, to have been\r\noriginally _written_ in Italian, but probably was first _published_ in\r\nFrench. Does the English Turkish Spy differ from the French one?[101]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPENSER, JONSON, AND SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe characters of these three great masters of English poetry are\r\nsketched by Fuller, in his \"Worthies of England.\" It is a literary\r\nmorsel that must not be passed by. The criticisms of those who lived in\r\nor near the times when authors flourished merit our observation. They\r\nsometimes elicit a ray of intelligence, which later opinions do not\r\nalways give.\r\n\r\nHe observes on SPENSER--\"The many _Chaucerisms_ used (for I will not say\r\naffected by him) are thought by the ignorant to be _blemishes_, known by\r\nthe learned to be _beauties_, to his book; which, notwithstanding, had\r\nbeen more SALEABLE, if more conformed to our modern language.\"\r\n\r\nOn JONSON.--\"His parts were not so ready _to run of themselves_, as able\r\nto answer the spur; so that it may be truly said of him, that he had an\r\n_elaborate wit_, wrought out by his own industry.--He would _sit silent_\r\nin learned company, and suck in (_besides wine_) their several humours\r\ninto his observation. What was _ore_ in _others_, he was able to\r\n_refine_ himself.\r\n\r\n\"He was paramount in the dramatic part of poetry, and taught the stage\r\nan exact conformity to the laws of comedians. His comedies were above\r\nthe _Volge_ (which are only tickled with downright obscenity), and took\r\nnot so well at the _first stroke_ as at the _rebound_, when beheld the\r\nsecond time; yea, they will endure reading so long as either ingenuity\r\nor learning are fashionable in our nation. If his latter be not so\r\nspriteful and vigorous as his first pieces, all that are old will, and\r\nall who desire to be old should, excuse him therein.\"\r\n\r\nOn SHAKSPEARE.--\"He was an eminent instance of the truth of that rule,\r\n_poëta non fit, sed nascitur_; one is not made, but born a poet. Indeed\r\nhis _learning_ was but very little; so that as _Cornish diamonds_ are\r\nnot polished by any lapidary, but are pointed and smooth, even as they\r\nare taken out of the earth, so _Nature_ itself was all the _art_ which\r\nwas used upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Many were the _wit-combats_ betwixt him and Ben Jonson, which two I\r\nbeheld like a _Spanish great galleon_ and an _English man of war_.\r\nMaster _Jonson_ (like the former) was built far higher in learning;\r\n_solid_, but _slow_ in his performances. _Shakspeare_, with an English\r\nman of war, lesser in _bulk_, but lighter in _sailing_, could _turn with\r\nall tides_, and take advantage of _all winds_, by the quickness of his\r\nwit and invention.\"\r\n\r\nHad these \"Wit-combats,\" between Shakspeare and Jonson, which Fuller\r\nnotices, been chronicled by some faithful _Boswell_ of the age, our\r\nliterary history would have received an interesting accession. A letter\r\nhas been published by Dr. Berkenhout relating to an evening's\r\nconversation between our great rival bards, and Alleyn the actor. Peele,\r\na dramatic poet, writes to his friend Marlow, another poet. The Doctor\r\nunfortunately in giving this copy did not recollect his authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"FRIEND MARLOW,\r\n\r\n\"I never longed for thy companye more than last night: we were all very\r\nmerrye at the Globe, where Ned Alleyn did not scruple to affirme\r\npleasantly to thy friend WILL, that he had stolen his speech about the\r\nqualityes of an actor's excellencye in Hamlet his Tragedye, from\r\nconversations manyfold which had passed between them, and opinyons given\r\nby Alleyn touchinge this subject. SHAKSPEARE did not take this talk in\r\ngood sorte; but JONSON put an end to the strife, by wittylie\r\nremarking,--this affaire needeth no contention: you stole it from NED,\r\nno doubt, do not marvel; have you not seen him act times out of number?\"\r\n\r\nThis letter is one of those ingenious forgeries which the late George\r\nSteevens practised on the literary antiquary; they were not always of\r\nthis innocent cast. The present has been frequently quoted as an\r\noriginal document. I have preserved it as an example of _Literary\r\nForgeries_, and the danger which literary historians incur by such\r\nnefarious practices.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Marana appears to have carelessly deserted his literary\r\noffspring. It is not improbable that his English translators continued\r\nhis plan, and that their volumes were translated; so that what appears\r\nthe French original may be, for the greater part, of our own home\r\nmanufacture. The superiority of the first part was early perceived. The\r\nhistory of our ancient Grub-street is enveloped in the obscurity of its\r\nmembers, and there are more claimants than one for the honour of this\r\ncontinuation. We know too little of Marana to account for his silence;\r\nCervantes was indignant at the impudent genius who dared to continue the\r\nimmortal Quixote.\r\n\r\nThe tale remains imperfectly told.\r\n\r\nSee a correspondence on this subject in the Gentleman's Magazine, 1840\r\nand 1841.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEN JONSON, FELTHAM, AND RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBen Jonson, like most celebrated wits, was very unfortunate in\r\nconciliating the affections of his brother writers. He certainly\r\npossessed a great share of arrogance, and was desirous of ruling the\r\nrealms of Parnassus with a despotic sceptre. That he was not always\r\nsuccessful in his theatrical compositions is evident from his abusing,\r\nin their title-page, the actors and the public. In this he has been\r\nimitated by Fielding. I have collected the following three satiric odes,\r\nwritten when the reception of his \"_New Inn_, or _The Light Heart_,\"\r\nwarmly exasperated the irritable disposition of our poet.\r\n\r\nHe printed the title in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n\"_The New Inn_, or _The Light Heart_; a Comedy never acted, but most\r\nnegligently played by some, the King's servants; and more squeamishly\r\nbeheld and censured by others, the King's subjects, 1629. Now at last\r\nset at liberty to the readers, his Majesty's servants and subjects, to\r\nbe judged, 1631.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of this play he published the following Ode, in which he\r\nthreatens to quit the stage for ever; and turn at once a Horace, an\r\nAnacreon, and a Pindar.\r\n\r\n\"The just indignation the author took at the vulgar censure of his play,\r\nbegat this following Ode to himself:--\r\n\r\n          Come, leave the loathed stage,\r\n          And the more loathsome age;\r\n      Where pride and impudence (in faction knit,)\r\n          Usurp the chair of wit;\r\n      Inditing and arraigning every day\r\n          Something they call a play.\r\n        Let their fastidious, vaine\r\n        Commission of braine\r\n    Run on, and rage, sweat, censure, and condemn;\r\n    They were not made for thee,--less thou for them.\r\n\r\n          Say that thou pour'st them wheat,\r\n          And they will acorns eat;\r\n      'Twere simple fury, still, thyself to waste\r\n          On such as have no taste!\r\n      To offer them a surfeit of pure bread,\r\n          Whose appetites are dead!\r\n        No, give them graines their fill,\r\n        Husks, draff, to drink and swill.\r\n    If they love lees, and leave the lusty wine,\r\n    Envy them not their palate with the swine.\r\n\r\n          No doubt some mouldy tale\r\n          Like PERICLES,[102] and stale\r\n      As the shrieve's crusts, and nasty as his fish--\r\n          Scraps, out of every dish\r\n      Thrown forth, and rak't into the common-tub,\r\n          May keep up the play-club:\r\n        There sweepings do as well\r\n        As the best order'd meale,\r\n    For who the relish of these guests will fit,\r\n    Needs set them but the almes-basket of wit.\r\n\r\n          And much good do't you then,\r\n          Brave plush and velvet men\r\n      Can feed on orts, and safe in your stage clothes,\r\n          Dare quit, upon your oathes,\r\n      The stagers, and the stage-wrights too (your peers),\r\n          Of larding your large ears\r\n        With their foul comic socks,\r\n        Wrought upon twenty blocks:\r\n    Which if they're torn, and turn'd, and patch'd enough\r\n    The gamesters share your gilt and you their stuff.\r\n\r\n          Leave things so prostitute,\r\n          And take the Alcæick lute,\r\n      Or thine own Horace, or Anacreon's lyre;\r\n        Warm thee by Pindar's fire;\r\n      And, tho' thy nerves be shrunk, and blood be cold,\r\n        Ere years have made thee old,\r\n      Strike that disdainful heat\r\n      Throughout, to their defeat;\r\n    As curious fools, and envious of thy strain,\r\n    May, blushing, swear no palsy's in thy brain.[103]\r\n\r\n            But when they hear thee sing\r\n            The glories of thy King,\r\n          His zeal to God, and his just awe o'er men,\r\n    They may blood-shaken then,\r\n      Feel such a flesh-quake to possess their powers,\r\n          As they shall cry 'like ours,\r\n        In sound of peace, or wars,\r\n        No harp ere hit the stars,\r\n    In tuning forth the acts of his sweet raign,\r\n    And raising Charles his chariot 'bove his wain.'\"\r\n\r\nThis Magisterial Ode, as Langbaine calls it, was answered by _Owen\r\nFeltham_, author of the admirable \"Resolves,\" who has written with great\r\nsatiric acerbity the retort courteous. His character of this poet should\r\nbe attended to:--\r\n\r\nAN ANSWER TO THE ODE, COME LEAVE THE LOATHED STAGE, &C.\r\n\r\n              Come leave this sawcy way\r\n              Of baiting those that pay\r\n          Dear for the sight of your declining wit:\r\n              'Tis known it is not fit\r\n            That a sale poet, just contempt once thrown,\r\n              Should cry up thus his own.\r\n            I wonder by what dower,\r\n            Or patent, you had power\r\n        From all to rape a judgment.

Johnson has inserted it in \"Broome's\r\nLife.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARIOSTO AND TASSO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt surprises one to find among the literary Italians the merits of\r\nAriosto most keenly disputed: slaves to classical authority, they bend\r\ndown to the majestic regularity of Tasso. Yet the father of Tasso,\r\nbefore his son had rivalled the romantic Ariosto, describes in a letter\r\nthe effect of the \"Orlando\" on the people:--\"There is no man of\r\nlearning, no mechanic, no lad, no girl, no old man, who is satisfied to\r\nread the 'Orlando Furioso' once. This poem serves as the solace of the\r\ntraveller, who fatigued on his journey deceives his lassitude by\r\nchanting some octaves of this poem. You may hear them sing these stanzas\r\nin the streets and in the fields every day.\" One would have expected\r\nthat Ariosto would have been the favourite of the people, and Tasso of\r\nthe critics. But in Venice the gondoliers, and others, sing passages\r\nwhich are generally taken from Tasso, and rarely from Ariosto. A\r\ndifferent fate, I imagined, would have attended the poet who has been\r\ndistinguished by the epithet of \"_The Divine_.\" I have been told by an\r\nItalian man of letters, that this circumstance arose from the relation\r\nwhich Tasso's poem bears to Turkish affairs; as many of the common\r\npeople have passed into Turkey either by chance or by war. Besides, the\r\nlong antipathy existing between the Venetians and the Turks gave\r\nadditional force to the patriotic poetry of Tasso. We cannot boast of\r\nany similar poems. Thus it was that the people of Greece and Ionia sang\r\nthe poems of Homer.\r\n\r\nThe Accademia della Crusca gave a public preference to Ariosto. This\r\nirritated certain critics, and none more than Chapelain, who could\r\n_taste_ the regularity of Tasso, but not _feel_ the \"brave disorder\" of\r\nAriosto. He could not approve of those writers,\r\n\r\n    Who snatch a grace beyond the reach of art.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" he writes, \"for the sonnet which your indignation\r\ndictated, at the Academy's preference of Ariosto to Tasso. This judgment\r\nis overthrown by the confessions of many of the _Cruscanti_, my\r\nassociates. It would be tedious to enter into its discussion; but it was\r\npassion and not equity that prompted that decision. We confess, that, as\r\nto what concerns invention and purity of language, Ariosto has eminently\r\nthe advantage over Tasso; but majesty, pomp, numbers, and a style truly\r\nsublime, united to regularity of design, raise the latter so much above\r\nthe other that no comparison can fairly exist.\"\r\n\r\nThe decision of Chapelain is not unjust; though I did not know that\r\nAriosto's language was purer than Tasso's.\r\n\r\nDr. Cocchi, the great Italian critic, compared \"Ariosto's poem to the\r\nricher kind of harlequin's habit, made up of pieces of the very best\r\nsilk, and of the liveliest colours. The parts of it are, many of them,\r\n_more beautiful_ than in Tasso's poem, but the whole in Tasso is without\r\ncomparison more of a piece and better made.\" The critic was extricating\r\nhimself as safely as he could out of this critical dilemma; for the\r\ndisputes were then so violent, that I think one of the disputants took\r\nto his bed, and was said to have died of Ariosto and Tasso.\r\n\r\nIt is the conceit of an Italian to give the name of _April_ to\r\n_Ariosto_, because it is the season of _flowers_; and that of\r\n_September_ to _Tasso_, which is that of _fruits_. Tiraboschi\r\njudiciously observes that no comparison ought to be made between these\r\ngreat rivals. It is comparing \"Ovid's Metamorphoses\" with \"Virgil's\r\nÆneid;\" they are quite different things. In his characters of the two\r\npoets, he distinguishes between a romantic poem and a regular epic.\r\nTheir designs required distinct perfections. But an English reader is\r\nnot enabled by the wretched versions of Hoole to echo the verse of La\r\nFontaine, \"JE CHERIS L'Arioste et J'ESTIME le Tasse.\"\r\n\r\nBoileau, some time before his death, was asked by a critic if he had\r\nrepented of his celebrated decision concerning the merits of Tasso,\r\nwhich some Italians had compared with those of Virgil? Boileau had\r\nhurled his bolts at these violators of classical majesty. It is supposed\r\nthat he was ignorant of the Italian language, but some expressions in\r\nhis answer may induce us to think that he was not.\r\n\r\n\"I have so little changed my opinion, that, on a _re-perusal_ lately of\r\nTasso, I was sorry that I had not more amply explained myself on this\r\nsubject in some of my reflections on 'Longinus.' I should have begun by\r\nacknowledging that Tasso had a sublime genius, of great compass, with\r\nhappy dispositions for the higher poetry. But when I came to the use he\r\nmade of his talents, I should have shown that judicious discernment\r\nrarely prevailed in his works. That in the greater portion of his\r\nnarrations he attached himself to the agreeable, oftener than to the\r\njust. That his descriptions are almost always overcharged with\r\nsuperfluous ornaments. That in painting the strongest passions, and in\r\nthe midst of the agitations they excite, frequently he degenerates into\r\nwitticisms, which abruptly destroy the pathetic. That he abounds with\r\nimages of too florid a kind; affected turns; conceits and frivolous\r\nthoughts; which, far from being adapted to his Jerusalem, could hardly\r\nbe supportable in his 'Aminta.' So that all this, opposed to the\r\ngravity, the sobriety, the majesty of Virgil, what is it but tinsel\r\ncompared with gold?\"\r\n\r\nThe merits of Tasso seem here precisely discriminated; and this\r\ncriticism must be valuable to the lovers of poetry. The errors of Tasso\r\nwere national.\r\n\r\nIn Venice the gondoliers know by heart long passages from Ariosto and\r\nTasso, and often chant them with a peculiar melody. Goldoni, in his\r\nlife, notices the gondolier returning with him to the city: \"He turned\r\nthe prow of the gondola towards the city, singing all the way the\r\ntwenty-sixth stanza of the sixteenth canto of the Jerusalem Delivered.\"\r\nThe late Mr. Barry once chanted to me a passage of Tasso in the manner\r\nof the gondoliers; and I have listened to such from one who in his youth\r\nhad himself been a gondolier. An anonymous gentleman has greatly obliged\r\nme with his account of the recitation of these poets by the gondoliers\r\nof Venice.\r\n\r\nThere are always two concerned, who alternately sing the strophes. We\r\nknow the melody eventually by Rousseau, to whose songs it is printed; it\r\nhas properly no melodious movement, and is a sort of medium between the\r\ncanto fermo and the canto figurato; it approaches to the former by\r\nrecitativical declamation, and to the latter by passages and course, by\r\nwhich one syllable is detained and embellished.\r\n\r\nI entered a gondola by moonlight: one singer placed himself forwards,\r\nand the other aft, and thus proceeded to Saint Giorgio. One began the\r\nsong: when he had ended his strophe the other took up the lay, and so\r\ncontinued the song alternately. Throughout the whole of it, the same\r\nnotes invariably returned; but, according to the subject matter of the\r\nstrophe, they laid a greater or a smaller stress, sometimes on one, and\r\nsometimes on another note, and indeed changed the enunciation of the\r\nwhole strophe, as the object of the poem altered.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, their sounds were hoarse and screaming: they\r\nseemed, in the manner of all rude uncivilised men, to make the\r\nexcellency of their singing consist in the force of their voice: one\r\nseemed desirous of conquering the other by the strength of his lungs,\r\nand so far from receiving delight from this scene (shut up as I was in\r\nthe box of the gondola), I found myself in a very unpleasant situation.\r\n\r\nMy companion, to whom I communicated this circumstance, being very\r\ndesirous to keep up the credit of his countrymen, assured me that this\r\nsinging was very delightful when heard at a distance. Accordingly we got\r\nout upon the shore, leaving one of the singers in the gondola, while the\r\nother went to the distance of some hundred paces. They now began to sing\r\nagainst one another; and I kept walking up and down between them both,\r\nso as always to leave him who was to begin his part. I frequently stood\r\nstill, and hearkened to the one and to the other.\r\n\r\nHere the scene was properly introduced. The strong declamatory, and, as\r\nit were, shrieking sound, met the ear from far, and called forth the\r\nattention; the quickly succeeding transitions, which necessarily\r\nrequired to be sung in a lower tone, seemed like plaintive strains\r\nsucceeding the vociferations of emotion or of pain. The other, who\r\nlistened attentively, immediately began where the former left off,\r\nanswering him in milder or more vehement notes, according as the purport\r\nof the strophe required. The sleepy canals, the lofty buildings, the\r\nsplendour of the moon, the deep shadows of the few gondolas that moved\r\nlike spirits hither and thither, increased the striking peculiarity of\r\nthe scene, and amidst all these circumstances it was easy to confess the\r\ncharacter of this wonderful harmony.\r\n\r\nIt suits perfectly well with an idle solitary mariner, lying at length\r\nin his vessel at rest on one of these canals, waiting for his company or\r\nfor a fare; the tiresomeness of which situation is somewhat alleviated\r\nby the songs and poetical stories he has in memory. He often raises his\r\nvoice as loud as he can, which extends itself to a vast distance over\r\nthe tranquil mirror; and, as all is still around, he is as it were in a\r\nsolitude in the midst of a large and populous town. Here is no rattling\r\nof carriages, no noise of foot passengers; a silent gondola glides now\r\nand then by him, of which the splashing of the oars is scarcely to be\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nAt a distance he hears another, perhaps utterly unknown to him. Melody\r\nand verse immediately attach the two strangers; he becomes the\r\nresponsive echo to the former, and exerts himself to be heard as he had\r\nheard the other. By a tacit convention they alternate verse for verse;\r\nthough the song should last the whole night through, they entertain,\r\nthemselves without fatigue; the hearers, who are passing between the\r\ntwo, take part in the amusement.\r\n\r\nThis vocal performance sounds best at a great distance, and is then\r\ninexpressibly charming, as it only fulfils its design in the sentiment\r\nof remoteness. It is plaintive, but not dismal in its sound; and at\r\ntimes it is scarcely possible to refrain from tears. My companion, who\r\notherwise was not a very delicately organised person, said quite\r\nunexpectedly, \"E singolare come quel canto intenerisce, e molto più\r\nquando la cantano meglio.\"\r\n\r\nI was told that the women of Lido, the long row of islands that divides\r\nthe Adriatic from the Lagouns, particularly the women of the extreme\r\ndistricts of Malamocca and Palestrina, sing in like manner the works of\r\nTasso to these and similar tunes.\r\n\r\nThey have the custom, when their husbands are fishing out at sea, to sit\r\nalong the shore in the evenings and vociferate these songs, and continue\r\nto do so with great violence, till each of them can distinguish the\r\nresponses of her own husband at a distance.\r\n\r\nHow much more delightful and more appropriate does this song show itself\r\nhere, than the call of a solitary person uttered far and wide, till\r\nanother equally disposed shall hear and answer him! It is the expression\r\nof a vehement and hearty longing, which yet is every moment nearer to\r\nthe happiness of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nLord Byron has told us that with the independence of Venice the song of\r\nthe gondolier has died away--\r\n\r\n    In Venice Tasso's echoes are no more.\r\n\r\nIf this be not more poetical than true, it must have occurred at a\r\nmoment when their last political change may have occasioned this silence\r\non the waters. My servant _Tita_, who was formerly the servant of his\r\nlordship, and whose name has been immortalised in the \"Italy\" of Mr.\r\nRogers, was himself a gondolier. He assures me that every night on the\r\nriver the chant may be heard. Many who cannot even read have acquired\r\nthe whole of Tasso, and some chant the stanzas of Ariosto. It is a sort\r\nof poetical challenge, and he who cannot take up the subject by\r\ncontinuing it is held as vanquished, and which occasions him no slight\r\nvexation. In a note in Lord Byron's works, this article is quoted by\r\nmistake as written by me, though I had mentioned it as the contribution\r\nof a stranger. We find by that note that there are two kinds of Tasso;\r\nthe original, and another called the \"_Canta alla Barcarola_,\" a\r\nspurious Tasso in the Venetian dialect: this latter, however, is rarely\r\nused. In the same note, a printer's error has been perpetuated through\r\nall the editions of Byron; the name of _Barry_, the painter, has been\r\nprinted _Berry_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew philosophers were more deserving of the title than, Bayle. His last\r\nhour exhibits the Socratic intrepidity with which he encountered the\r\nformidable approach of death. I have seen the original letter of the\r\nbookseller Leers, where he describes the death of our philosopher. \"On\r\nthe evening preceding his decease, having studied all day, he gave my\r\ncorrector some copy of his 'Answer to Jacquelot,' and told him that he\r\nwas very ill. At nine in the morning his laundress entered his chamber;\r\nhe asked her, with a dying voice, if his fire was kindled? and a few\r\nmoments after he died.\" His disease was an hereditary consumption, and\r\nhis decline must have been gradual; speaking had become with him a great\r\npain, but he laboured with the same tranquillity of mind to his last\r\nhour; and, with Bayle, it was death alone which, could interrupt the\r\nprinter.\r\n\r\nThe irritability of genius is forcibly characterised by this\r\ncircumstance in his literary life. When a close friendship had united\r\nhim to Jurieu, he lavished on him the most flattering eulogiums: he is\r\nthe hero of his \"Republic of Letters.\" Enmity succeeded to friendship;\r\nJurieu is then continually quoted in his \"Critical Dictionary,\" whenever\r\nan occasion offers to give instances of gross blunders, palpable\r\ncontradictions, and inconclusive arguments. These inconsistent opinions\r\nmay be sanctioned by the similar conduct of a _Saint_! St. Jerome\r\npraised Rufinus as the most learned man of his age, while his friend;\r\nbut when the same Rufinus joined his adversary Origen, he called him one\r\nof the most ignorant!\r\n\r\nAs a logician Bayle had no superior; the best logician will, however,\r\nfrequently deceive himself. Bayle made long and close arguments to show\r\nthat La Motte le Vayer never could have been a preceptor to the king;\r\nbut all his reasonings are overturned by the fact being given in the\r\n\"History of the Academy,\" by Pelisson.\r\n\r\nBasnage said of Bayle, that _he read much by his fingers_. He meant that\r\nhe ran over a book more than he read it; and that he had the art of\r\nalways falling upon that which was most essential and curious in the\r\nbook he examined.\r\n\r\nThere are heavy hours in which the mind of a man of letters is unhinged;\r\nwhen the intellectual faculties lose all their elasticity, and when\r\nnothing but the simplest actions are adapted to their enfeebled state.\r\nAt such hours it is recorded of the Jewish Socrates, Moses Mendelssohn,\r\nthat he would stand at his window, and count the tiles of his\r\nneighbour's house. An anonymous writer has told of Bayle, that he would\r\nfrequently wrap himself in his cloak, and hasten to places where\r\nmountebanks resorted; and that this was one of his chief amusements. He\r\nis surprised that so great a philosopher should delight in so trifling\r\nan object. This objection is not injurious to the character of Bayle;\r\nit only proves that the writer himself was no philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe \"Monthly Reviewer,\" in noticing this article, has continued the\r\nspeculation by giving two interesting anecdotes. \"The observation\r\nconcerning 'heavy hours,' and the want of elasticity in the intellectual\r\nfaculties of men of letters, when the mind is fatigued and the attention\r\nblunted by incessant labour, reminds us of what is related by persons\r\nwho were acquainted with the late sagacious magistrate Sir John\r\nFielding; who, when fatigued with attending to complicated cases, and\r\nperplexed with discordant depositions, used to retire to a little closet\r\nin a remote and tranquil part of the house, to rest his mental powers\r\nand sharpen perception. He told a great physician, now living, who\r\ncomplained of the distance of places, as caused by the great extension\r\nof London, that 'he (the physician) would not have been able to visit\r\nmany patients to any purpose, if they had resided nearer to each other;\r\nas he could have had no time either to think or to rest his mind.'\"\r\n\r\nOur excellent logician was little accustomed to a mixed society: his\r\nlife was passed in study. He had such an infantine simplicity in his\r\nnature, that he would speak on anatomical subjects before the ladies\r\nwith as much freedom as before surgeons. When they inclined their eyes\r\nto the ground, and while some even blushed, he would then inquire if\r\nwhat he spoke was indecent; and, when told so, he smiled, and stopped.\r\nHis habits of life were, however, extremely pure; he probably left\r\nhimself little leisure \"_to fall into temptation_.\"\r\n\r\nBayle knew nothing of geometry; and, as Le Clerc informs us,\r\nacknowledged that he could never comprehend the demonstration of the\r\nfirst problem in Euclid. Le Clerc, however, was a rival to Bayle; with\r\ngreater industry and more accurate learning, but with very inferior\r\npowers of reasoning and philosophy. Both of these great scholars, like\r\nour Locke, were destitute of fine taste and poetical discernment.\r\n\r\nWhen Fagon, an eminent physician, was consulted on the illness of our\r\nstudent, he only prescribed a particular regimen, without the use of\r\nmedicine. He closed his consultation by a compliment remarkable for its\r\nfelicity. \"I ardently wish one could spare this great man all this\r\nconstraint, and that it were possible to find a remedy as singular as\r\nthe merit of him for whom it is asked.\"\r\n\r\nVoltaire has said that Bayle confessed he would not have made his\r\nDictionary exceed a folio volume, had he written only for himself, and\r\nnot for the booksellers. This Dictionary, with all its human faults, is\r\na stupendous work, which must last with literature itself. I take an\r\nenlarged view of BAYLE and his DICTIONARY, in a subsequent article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCERVANTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Du Boulay accompanied the French ambassador to Spain, when Cervantes\r\nwas yet living. He told Segrais that the ambassador one day complimented\r\nCervantes on the great reputation he had acquired by his Don Quixote;\r\nand that Cervantes whispered in his ear, \"Had it not been for the\r\nInquisition, I should have made my book much more entertaining.\"\r\n\r\nCervantes, at the battle of Lepanto, was wounded, and enslaved. He has\r\ngiven his own history in Don Quixote, as indeed every great writer of\r\nfictitious narratives has usually done. Cervantes was known at the court\r\nof Spain, but he did not receive those favours which might have been\r\nexpected; he was neglected. His first volume is the finest; and his\r\ndesign was to have finished there: but he could not resist the\r\nimportunities of his friends, who engaged him to make a second, which\r\nhas not the same force, although it has many splendid passages.\r\n\r\nWe have lost many good things of Cervantes, and other writers, through\r\nthe tribunal of religion and dulness. One Aonius Palearius was sensible\r\nof this; and said, \"that the Inquisition was a poniard aimed at the\r\nthroat of literature.\" The image is striking, and the observation just;\r\nbut this victim of genius was soon led to the stake!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGLIABECHI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony Magliabechi, who died at the age of eighty, was celebrated for\r\nhis great knowledge of books. He has been called the _Helluo_, or the\r\nGlutton of Literature, as Peter _Comestor_ received his nickname from\r\nhis amazing voracity for food he could never digest; which appeared when\r\nhaving fallen sick of so much false learning, he threw it all up in his\r\n\"_Sea of Histories_,\" which proved to be the history of all things, and\r\na bad history of everything. Magliabechi's character is singular; for\r\nthough his life was wholly passed in libraries, being librarian to the\r\nDuke of Tuscany, he never _wrote_ himself. There is a medal which\r\nrepresents him sitting, with a book in one hand, and a great number of\r\nbooks scattered on the ground. The candid inscription signifies, that\r\n\"it is not sufficient to become learned to have read much, if we read\r\nwithout reflection.\" This is the only remains we have of his own\r\ncomposition that can be of service to posterity. A simple truth, which\r\nmay, however, be inscribed in the study of every man of letters.\r\n\r\nHis habits of life were uniform. Ever among his books, he troubled\r\nhimself with no other concern whatever; and the only interest he\r\nappeared to take for any living thing was his spiders. While sitting\r\namong his literary piles, he affected great sympathy for these weavers\r\nof webs, and perhaps in contempt of those whose curiosity appeared\r\nimpertinent, he frequently cried out, \"to take care not to hurt his\r\nspiders!\" Although he lost no time in writing himself, he gave\r\nconsiderable assistance to authors who consulted him. He was himself an\r\nuniversal index to all authors; the late literary antiquary, Isaac Reed,\r\nresembled him.[108] He had one book, among many others, dedicated to\r\nhim, and this dedication consisted of a collection of titles of works\r\nwhich he had had at different times dedicated to him, with all the\r\neulogiums addressed to him in prose and verse. When he died, he left his\r\nvast collection for the public use; they now compose the public library\r\nof Florence.\r\n\r\nHeyman, a celebrated Dutch professor, visited this erudite librarian,\r\nwho was considered as the ornament of Florence. He found him amongst his\r\nbooks, of which the number was prodigious. Two or three rooms in the\r\nfirst story were crowded with them, not only along their sides, but\r\npiled in heaps on the floor; so that it was difficult to sit, and more\r\nso to walk. A narrow space was contrived, indeed, so that by walking\r\nsideways you might extricate yourself from one room to another. This was\r\nnot all; the passage below stairs was full of books, and the staircase\r\nfrom the top to the bottom was lined with them. When you reached the\r\nsecond story, you saw with astonishment three rooms, similar to those\r\nbelow, equally so crowded, that two good beds in these chambers were\r\nalso crammed with books.\r\n\r\nThis apparent confusion did not, however, hinder Magliabechi from\r\nimmediately finding the books he wanted. He knew them all so well, that\r\neven to the least of them it was sufficient to see its outside, to say\r\nwhat it was; he knew his flock, as shepherds are said, by their faces;\r\nand indeed he read them day and night, and never lost sight of any.[109]\r\nHe ate on his books, he slept on his books, and quitted them as rarely\r\nas possible. During his whole life he only went twice from Florence;\r\nonce to see Fiesoli, which is not above two leagues distant, and once\r\nten miles further by order of the Grand Duke. Nothing could be more\r\nsimple than his mode of life; a few eggs, a little bread, and some\r\nwater, were his ordinary food. A drawer of his desk being open, Mr.\r\nHeyman saw there several eggs, and some money which Magliabechi had\r\nplaced there for his daily use. But as this drawer was generally open,\r\nit frequently happened that the servants of his friends, or strangers\r\nwho came to see him, pilfered some of these things; the money or the\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nHis dress was as cynical as his repasts. A black doublet, which\r\ndescended to his knees; large and long breeches; an old patched black\r\ncloak; an amorphous hat, very much worn, and the edges ragged; a large\r\nneckcloth of coarse cloth, begrimed with snuff; a dirty shirt, which he\r\nalways wore as long as it lasted, and which the broken elbows of his\r\ndoublet did not conceal; and, to finish this inventory, a pair of\r\nruffles which did not belong to the shirt. Such was the brilliant dress\r\nof our learned Florentine; and in such did he appear in the public\r\nstreets, as well as in his own house. Let me not forget another\r\ncircumstance; to warm his hands, he generally had a stove with fire\r\nfastened to his arms, so that his clothes were generally singed and\r\nburnt, and his hands scorched. He had nothing otherwise remarkable about\r\nhim. To literary men he was extremely affable, and a cynic only to the\r\neye; anecdotes almost incredible are related of his memory. It is\r\nsomewhat uncommon that as he was so fond of literary _food_, he did not\r\noccasionally dress some dishes of his own invention, or at least some\r\nsandwiches to his own relish. He indeed should have written CURIOSITIES\r\nOF LITERATURE. He was a living Cyclopaedia, though a dark lantern.[110]\r\n\r\nOf such reading men, Hobbes entertained a very contemptible, if not a\r\nrash opinion. His own reading was inconsiderable; and he used to say,\r\nthat if he had spent as much time in _reading_ as other men of learning,\r\nhe should have been as _ignorant_ as they. He put little value on a\r\n_large library_, for he considered all _books_ to be merely _extracts_\r\nand _copies_, for that most authors were like sheep, never deviating\r\nfrom the beaten path. History he treated lightly, and thought there were\r\nmore lies than truths in it. But let us recollect after all this, that\r\nHobbes was a mere metaphysician, idolising his own vain and empty\r\nhypotheses. It is true enough that weak heads carrying in them too much\r\nreading may be staggered. Le Clerc observes of two learned men, De\r\nMarcilly and Barthius, that they would have composed more useful works\r\nhad they _read_ less numerous authors, and digested the better writers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: He was remarkable for his memory of all that he read, not\r\nonly the matter but the form, the contents of each page and the peculiar\r\nspelling of every word. It is said he was once tested by the pretended\r\ndestruction of a manuscript, which he reproduced without a variation of\r\nword or line.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: He used to lie in a sort of lounging-chair in the midst\r\nof his study, surrounded by heaps of dusty volumes, never allowed to be\r\nremoved, and forming a colony for the spiders whose society he so highly\r\nvalued.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRIDGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbridgers are a kind of literary men to whom the indolence of modern\r\nreaders, and indeed the multiplicity of authors, give ample employment.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult, observed the learned Benedictines, the authors of\r\nthe Literary History of France, to relate all the unhappy consequences\r\nwhich ignorance introduced, and the causes which produced that\r\nignorance. But we must not forget to place in this number the mode of\r\nreducing, by way of abridgment, what the ancients had written in bulky\r\nvolumes. Examples of this practice may be observed in preceding\r\ncenturies, but in the fifth century it began to be in general use. As\r\nthe number of students and readers diminished, authors neglected\r\nliterature, and were disgusted with composition; for to write is seldom\r\ndone, but when the writer entertains the hope of finding readers.\r\nInstead of original authors, there suddenly arose numbers of Abridgers.\r\nThese men, amidst the prevailing disgust for literature, imagined they\r\nshould gratify the public by introducing a mode of reading works in a\r\nfew hours, which otherwise could not be done in many months; and,\r\nobserving that the bulky volumes of the ancients lay buried in dust,\r\nwithout any one condescending to examine them, necessity inspired them\r\nwith an invention that might bring those works and themselves into\r\npublic notice, by the care they took of renovating them. This they\r\nimagined to effect by forming abridgments of these ponderous tomes.\r\n\r\nAll these Abridgers, however, did not follow the same mode. Some\r\ncontented themselves with making a mere abridgment of their authors, by\r\nemploying their own expressions, or by inconsiderable alterations.\r\nOthers formed abridgments in drawing them from various authors, but from\r\nwhose works they only took what appeared to them most worthy of\r\nobservation, and embellished them in their own style. Others again,\r\nhaving before them several authors who wrote on the same subject, took\r\npassages from each, united them, and thus combined a new work; they\r\nexecuted their design by digesting in commonplaces, and under various\r\ntitles, the most valuable parts they could collect, from the best\r\nauthors they read. To these last ingenious scholars we owe the rescue of\r\nmany valuable fragments of antiquity. They fortunately preserved the\r\nbest maxims, characters, descriptions, and curious matters which they\r\nhad found interesting in their studies.\r\n\r\nSome learned men have censured these Abridgers as the cause of our\r\nhaving lost so many excellent entire works of the ancients; for\r\nposterity becoming less studious was satisfied with these extracts, and\r\nneglected to preserve the originals, whose voluminous size was less\r\nattractive. Others, on the contrary, say that these Abridgers have not\r\nbeen so prejudicial to literature; and that had it not been for their\r\ncare, which snatched many a perishable fragment from that shipwreck of\r\nletters which the barbarians occasioned, we should perhaps have had no\r\nworks of the ancients remaining. Many voluminous works have been greatly\r\nimproved by their Abridgers. The vast history of Trogus Pompeius was\r\nsoon forgotten and finally perished, after the excellent epitome of it\r\nby Justin, who winnowed the abundant chaff from the grain.\r\n\r\nBayle gives very excellent advice to an Abridger, Xiphilin, in his\r\n\"Abridgment of Dion,\" takes no notice of a circumstance very material\r\nfor entering into the character of Domitian:--the recalling the empress\r\nDomitia after having turned her away for her intrigues with a player. By\r\nomitting this fact in the abridgment, and which is discovered through\r\nSuetonius, Xiphilin has evinced, he says, a deficient judgment; for\r\nDomitian's ill qualities are much better exposed, when it is known that\r\nhe was mean-spirited enough to restore to the dignity of Empress the\r\nprostitute of a player.\r\n\r\nAbridgers, Compilers, and Translators, are now slightly regarded; yet to\r\nform their works with skill requires an exertion of judgment, and\r\nfrequently of taste, of which their contemners appear to have no due\r\nconception. Such literary labours it is thought the learned will not be\r\nfound to want; and the unlearned cannot discern the value. But to such\r\nAbridgers as Monsieur Le Grand, in his \"Tales of the Minstrels,\" and Mr.\r\nEllis, in his \"English Metrical Romances,\" we owe much; and such writers\r\nmust bring to their task a congeniality of genius, and even more taste\r\nthan their original possessed. I must compare such to fine etchers after\r\ngreat masters:--very few give the feeling touches in the right place.\r\n\r\nIt is an uncommon circumstance to quote the Scriptures on subjects of\r\n_modern literature_! but on the present topic the elegant writer of the\r\nbooks of the Maccabees has delivered, in a kind of preface to that\r\nhistory, very pleasing and useful instructions to an _Abridger_. I shall\r\ntranscribe the passages, being concise, from Book ii. Chap. ii. v. 23,\r\nthat the reader may have them at hand:--\r\n\r\n\"All these things, I say, being declared by Jason of Cyrene, in _five\r\nbooks_, we will assay to _abridge_ in one volume. We will be careful\r\nthat they that will read may have _delight_, and that they that are\r\ndesirous to commit to memory might have _ease_, and that all into whose\r\nhands it comes might have _profit_.\" How concise and Horatian! He then\r\ndescribes his literary labours with no insensibility:--\"To us that have\r\ntaken upon us this painful labour of _abridging_, it was not easy, but a\r\nmatter of _sweat_ and _watching_.\"--And the writer employs an elegant\r\nillustration: \"Even as it is no ease unto him that prepareth a banquet,\r\nand seeketh the benefit of others; yet for the pleasuring of many, we\r\nwill undertake gladly this great pain; leaving to the author the exact\r\nhandling of every particular, and labouring to follow the _rules of an\r\nabridgment_.\" He now embellishes his critical account with a sublime\r\nmetaphor to distinguish the original from the copier:--\"For as the\r\nmaster builder of a new house must care for the whole building; but he\r\nthat undertaketh to set it out, and paint it, must seek out fit things\r\nfor the adorning thereof; even so I think it is with us. To stand upon\r\n_every point_, and _go over things at large_, and to be _curious_ in\r\n_particulars_, belonging to the _first author_ of the story; but to use\r\n_brevity_, and avoid _much labouring_ of the work, is to be granted to\r\nhim that will make an Abridgment.\"\r\n\r\nQuintilian has not a passage more elegantly composed, nor more\r\njudiciously conceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: His comparatively useless life was quietly satirized by\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Spence, in \"a parallel after the manner of Plutarch,\"\r\nbetween Magliabechi and Hill, a self-taught tailor of Buckinghamshire.\r\nIt is published in Dodsley's _Fugitive Pieces_, 2 vols., 12mo, 1774.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSORS OF PLAGIARISM AND OBSCURITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most singular characters in literature may be ranked those who\r\ndo not blush to profess publicly its most dishonourable practices. The\r\nfirst vender of printed sermons imitating manuscript, was, I think, Dr.\r\nTrusler. He to whom the following anecdotes relate had superior\r\ningenuity. Like the famous orator, Henley, he formed a school of his\r\nown. The present lecturer openly taught not to _imitate_ the best\r\nauthors, but to _steal_ from them!\r\n\r\nRichesource, a miserable declaimer, called himself \"Moderator of the\r\nAcademy of Philosophical Orators.\" He taught how a person destitute of\r\nliterary talents might become eminent for literature; and published the\r\nprinciples of his art under the title of \"The Mask of Orators; or the\r\nmanner of disguising all kinds of composition; briefs, sermons,\r\npanegyrics, funeral orations, dedications, speeches, letters, passages,\"\r\n&c. I will give a notion of the work:--\r\n\r\nThe author very truly observes, that all who apply themselves to polite\r\nliterature do not always find from their own funds a sufficient supply\r\nto insure success. For such he labours; and teaches to gather, in the\r\ngardens of others, those fruits of which their own sterile grounds are\r\ndestitute; but so artfully to gather, that the public shall not perceive\r\ntheir depredations. He dignifies this fine art by the title of\r\nPLAGIANISM, and thus explains it:--\r\n\r\n\"The Plagianism of orators is the art, or an ingenious and easy mode,\r\nwhich some adroitly employ, to change, or disguise, all sorts of\r\nspeeches of their own composition, or that of other authors, for their\r\npleasure or their utility; in such a manner that it becomes impossible,\r\neven for the author himself to recognise his own work, his own genius,\r\nand his own style, so skilfully shall the whole be disguised.\"\r\n\r\nOur professor proceeds to reveal the manner of managing the whole\r\neconomy of the piece which is to be copied or disguised; and which\r\nconsists in giving a new order to the parts, changing the phrases, the\r\nwords, &c. An orator, for instance, having said that a plenipotentiary\r\nshould possess three qualities,--_probity_, _capacity_, and _courage_;\r\nthe plagiarist, on the contrary, may employ, _courage_, _capacity_, and\r\n_probity_. This is only for a general rule, for it is too simple to\r\npractise frequently. To render the part perfect we must make it more\r\ncomplex, by changing the whole of the expressions. The plagiarist in\r\nplace of _courage_, will put _force_, _constancy_, or _vigour_. For\r\n_probity_ he may say _religion_, _virtue_, or _sincerity_. Instead of\r\n_capacity_, he may substitute _erudition_, _ability_, or _science_. Or\r\nhe may disguise the whole by saying, that the _plenipotentiary should be\r\nfirm, virtuous_, and _able_.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this uncommon work is composed of passages extracted from\r\ncelebrated writers, which are turned into the new manner of the\r\nplagiarist; their beauties, however, are never improved by their dress.\r\nSeveral celebrated writers when young, particularly the famous Flechier,\r\nwho addressed verses to him, frequented the lectures of this professor!\r\n\r\nRichesource became so zealous in this course of literature, that he\r\npublished a volume, entitled, \"The Art of Writing and Speaking; or, a\r\nMethod of composing all sorts of Letters, and holding a polite\r\nConversation.\" He concludes his preface by advertising his readers, that\r\nauthors who may be in want of essays, sermons, letters of all kinds,\r\nwritten pleadings and verses, may be accommodated on application to him.\r\n\r\nOur professor was extremely fond of copious title-pages, which I suppose\r\nto be very attractive to certain readers; for it is a custom which the\r\nRichesources of the day fail not to employ. Are there persons who value\r\n_books_ by the length of their titles, as formerly the ability of a\r\nphysician was judged by the dimensions of his wig?\r\n\r\nTo this article may be added an account of another singular school,\r\nwhere the professor taught _obscurity_ in literary composition!\r\n\r\nI do not believe that those who are unintelligible are very\r\nintelligent. Quintilian has justly observed, that the obscurity of a\r\nwriter is generally in proportion to his incapacity. However, as there\r\nis hardly a defect which does not find partisans, the same author\r\ninforms us of a rhetorician, who was so great an admirer of obscurity,\r\nthat he always exhorted his scholars to preserve it; and made them\r\ncorrect, as blemishes, those passages of their works which appeared to\r\nhim too intelligible. Quintilian adds, that the greatest panegyric they\r\ncould give to a composition in that school was to declare, \"I understand\r\nnothing of this piece.\" Lycophron possessed this taste, and he protested\r\nthat he would hang himself if he found a person who should understand\r\nhis poem, called the \"Prophecy of Cassandra.\" He succeeded so well, that\r\nthis piece has been the stumbling-block of all the grammarians,\r\nscholiasts, and commentators; and remains inexplicable to the present\r\nday. Such works Charpentier admirably compares to those subterraneous\r\nplaces, where the air is so thick and suffocating, that it extinguishes\r\nall torches. A most sophistical dilemma, on the subject of _obscurity_,\r\nwas made by Thomas Anglus, or White, an English Catholic priest, the\r\nfriend of Sir Kenelm Digby. This learned man frequently wandered in the\r\nmazes of metaphysical subtilties; and became perfectly unintelligible to\r\nhis readers. When accused of this obscurity, he replied, \"Either the\r\nlearned understand me, or they do not. If they understand me, and find\r\nme in an error, it is easy for them to refute me; if they do not\r\nunderstand me, it is very unreasonable for them to exclaim against my\r\ndoctrines.\"\r\n\r\nThis is saying all that the wit of man can suggest in favour of\r\n_obscurity_! Many, however, will agree with an observation made by\r\nGravina on the over-refinement of modern composition, that \"we do not\r\nthink we have attained genius, till others must possess as much\r\nthemselves to understand us.\" Fontenelle, in France, followed by\r\nMarivaux, Thomas, and others, first introduced that subtilised manner of\r\nwriting, which tastes more natural and simple reject; one source of such\r\nbitter complaints of obscurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY DUTCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nPere Bohours seriously asks if a German _can be a_ BEL ESPRIT? This\r\nconcise query was answered by Kramer, in a ponderous volume which bears\r\nfor title, _Vindiciæ nominis Germanici_. This mode of refutation does\r\nnot prove that the question was _then_ so ridiculous as it was\r\nconsidered. The Germans of the present day, although greatly superior to\r\ntheir ancestors, there are who opine are still distant from the _acmé_\r\nof TASTE, which characterises the finished compositions of the French\r\nand the English authors. Nations display _genius_ before they form\r\n_taste_.\r\n\r\nIt was the mode with English and French writers to dishonour the Germans\r\nwith the epithets of heavy, dull, and phlegmatic compilers, without\r\ntaste, spirit, or genius; genuine descendants of the ancient Boeotians,\r\n\r\n    Crassoque sub æëre nati.\r\n\r\nMany imaginative and many philosophical performances have lately shown\r\nthat this censure has now become unjust; and much more forcibly answers\r\nthe sarcastic question of Bohours than the thick quarto of Kramer.\r\n\r\nChurchill finely says of genius that it is independent of situation,\r\n\r\n    And may hereafter even in HOLLAND rise.\r\n\r\nVondel, whom, as Marchand observes, the Dutch regard as their Æschylus,\r\nSophocles, and Euripides, had a strange defective taste; the poet\r\nhimself knew none of these originals, but he wrote on patriotic\r\nsubjects, the sure way to obtain popularity; many of his tragedies are\r\nalso drawn from the Scriptures; all badly chosen and unhappily executed.\r\nIn his _Deliverance of the Children of Israel_, one of his principal\r\ncharacters is the _Divinity_! In his _Jerusalem Destroyed_ we are\r\ndisgusted with a tedious oration by the angel Gabriel, who proves\r\ntheologically, and his proofs extend through nine closely printed pages\r\nin quarto, that this destruction has been predicted by the prophets;\r\nand, in the _Lucifer_ of the same author, the subject is grossly\r\nscandalised by this haughty spirit becoming stupidly in love with Eve,\r\nand it is for her he causes the rebellion of the evil angels, and the\r\nfall of our first parents. Poor Vondel kept a hosier's shop, which he\r\nleft to the care of his wife, while he indulged his poetical genius.\r\nHis stocking-shop failed, and his poems produced him more chagrin than\r\nglory; for in Holland, even a patriotic poet, if a bankrupt, would, no\r\ndoubt, be accounted by his fellow-citizens as a madman. Vondel had no\r\nother master but his genius, which, with his uncongenial situation,\r\noccasioned all his errors.\r\n\r\nAnother Dutch poet is even less tolerable. Having written a long\r\nrhapsody concerning Pyramus and Thisbe, he concludes it by a ridiculous\r\nparallel between the death of these unfortunate victims of love, and the\r\npassion of Jesus Christ. He says:--\r\n\r\n    Om t'concluderem van onsen begrypt,\r\n    Dees Historie moraliserende,\r\n    Is in den verstande wel accorderende,\r\n    By der Passie van Christus gebenedyt.\r\n\r\nAnd upon this, after having turned Pyramus into the Son of God, and\r\nThisbe into the Christian soul, he proceeds with a number of\r\ncomparisons; the latter always more impertinent than the former.\r\n\r\nI believe it is well known that the actors on the Dutch theatre are\r\ngenerally tradesmen, who quit their aprons at the hour of public\r\nrepresentation. This was the fact when I was in Holland more than forty\r\nyears ago. Their comedies are offensive by the grossness of their\r\nbuffooneries. One of their comic incidents was a miller appearing in\r\ndistress for want of wind to turn his mill; he had recourse to the novel\r\nscheme of placing his back against it, and by certain imitative sounds\r\nbehind the scenes the mill is soon set a-going. It is hard to rival such\r\na depravity of taste.\r\n\r\nI saw two of their most celebrated tragedies. The one was Gysbert Van\r\nAmstel, by Vondel; that is Gysbrecht of Amsterdam, a warrior, who in the\r\ncivil wars preserved this city by his heroism. It is a patriotic\r\nhistorical play, and never fails to crowd the theatre towards Christmas,\r\nwhen it is usually performed successively. One of the acts concludes\r\nwith the scene of a convent; the sound of warlike instruments is heard;\r\nthe abbey is stormed; the nuns and fathers are slaughtered; with the aid\r\nof \"blunderbuss and thunder,\" every Dutchman appears sensible of the\r\npathos of the poet. But it does not here conclude. After this terrible\r\nslaughter, the conquerors and the vanquished remain for _ten minutes_ on\r\nthe stage, silent and motionless, in the attitudes in which the groups\r\nhappened to fall! and this pantomimic pathos commands loud bursts of\r\napplause.[111]\r\n\r\nThe other was the Ahasuerus of Schubart, or the Fall of Haman. In the\r\ntriumphal entry the Batavian Mordecai was mounted on a genuine Flanders\r\nmare, that, fortunately, quietly received _her_ applause with a lumpish\r\nmajesty resembling her rider. I have seen an English ass once introduced\r\non our stage which did not act with this decorum. Our late actors have\r\nfrequently been beasts;--a Dutch taste![112]\r\n\r\nSome few specimens of the best Dutch poetry which we have had, yield no\r\nevidence in favour of the national poetical taste. The Dutch poet Katz\r\nhas a poem on the \"Games of Children,\" where all the games are\r\nmoralised; I suspect the taste of the poet as well as his subject is\r\npuerile. When a nation has produced no works above mediocrity, with them\r\na certain mediocrity is excellence, and their masterpieces, with a\r\npeople who have made a greater progress in refinement, can never be\r\naccepted as the works of a master.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: The Dutch are not, however, to be entirely blamed for\r\nrepulsive scenes on the stage. Shakspeare's Titus Andronicus, and many\r\nof the dramas of our Elizabethan writers, exhibit cruelties very\r\nrepulsive to modern ideas. The French stage has occasionally exhibited\r\nin modern times scenes that have been afterwards condemned by the\r\ncensors; and in Italy the \"people's theatre\" occasionally panders to\r\npopular tastes by execution scenes, where the criminal is merely taken\r\noff the stage; the blow struck on a wooden block, to give reality to the\r\naction; and the executioner re-enters flourishing a bloody axe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Ned Shuter was the comedian who first introduced a donkey\r\non the stage. Seated on the beast he delivered a prologue written on the\r\noccasion of his benefit. Sometimes the donkey wore a great tie-wig.\r\nAnimals educated to play certain parts are a later invention. Horses,\r\ndogs, and elephants have been thus trained in the present century, and\r\nplays written expressly to show their proficiency.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTIONS OF THE MIND NOT SEIZABLE BY CREDITORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Crebillon, the French tragic poet, published his Catiline, it was\r\nattended with an honour to literature, which though it is probably\r\nforgotten, for it was only registered, I think, as the news of the day,\r\nit becomes one zealous in the cause of literature to preserve. I give\r\nthe circumstance, the petition, and the decree.\r\n\r\nAt the time Catiline was given to the public, the creditors of the poet\r\nhad the cruelty to attach the produce of this piece, as well at the\r\nbookseller's, who had printed the tragedy, as at the theatre where it\r\nwas performed. The poet, irritated at these proceedings, addressed a\r\npetition to the king, in which he showed \"that it was a thing yet\r\nunknown, that it should be allowed to class amongst seizable effects the\r\nproductions of the human mind; that if such a practice was permitted,\r\nthose who had consecrated their vigils to the studies of literature, and\r\nwho had made the greatest efforts to render themselves, by this means,\r\nuseful to their country, would see themselves placed in the cruel\r\npredicament of not venturing to publish works, often precious and\r\ninteresting to the state; that the greater part of those who devote\r\nthemselves to literature require for the first wants of life those aids\r\nwhich they have a right to expect from their labours; and that it never\r\nhas been suffered in France to seize the fees of lawyers, and other\r\npersons of liberal professions.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this petition, a decree immediately issued from the King's\r\ncouncil, commanding a replevy of the arrests and seizures of which the\r\npetitioner complained. This honourable decree was dated 21st of May,\r\n1749, and bore the following title:--\"Decree of the Council of his\r\nMajesty, in favour of M. Crebillon, author of the tragedy of Catiline,\r\nwhich declares that the productions of the mind are not amongst seizable\r\neffects.\"\r\n\r\nLouis XV. exhibits the noble example of bestowing a mark of\r\nconsideration to the remains of a man of letters. This King not only\r\ntestified his esteem of Crebillon by having his works printed at the\r\nLouvre, but also by consecrating to his glory a tomb of marble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWriters who have been unsuccessful in original composition have their\r\nother productions immediately decried, whatever merit they might once\r\nhave been allowed to possess. Yet this is very unjust; an author who has\r\ngiven a wrong direction to his literary powers may perceive, at length,\r\nwhere he can more securely point them. Experience is as excellent a\r\nmistress in the school of literature as in the school of human life.\r\nBlackmore's epics are insufferable; yet neither Addison nor Johnson\r\nerred when they considered his philosophical poem as a valuable\r\ncomposition. An indifferent poet may exert the art of criticism in a\r\nvery high degree; and if he cannot himself produce an original work, he\r\nmay yet be of great service in regulating the happier genius of another.\r\nThis observation I shall illustrate by the characters of two French\r\ncritics; the one is the Abbé d'Aubignac, and the other Chapelain.\r\n\r\nBoileau opens his Art of Poetry by a precept which though it be common\r\nis always important; this critical poet declares, that \"It is in vain a\r\ndaring author thinks of attaining to the height of Parnassus if he does\r\nnot feel the secret influence of heaven, and if his natal star has not\r\nformed him to be a poet.\" This observation he founded on the character\r\nof our Abbé; who had excellently written on the economy of dramatic\r\ncomposition. His _Pratique du Théâtre_ gained him an extensive\r\nreputation. When he produced a tragedy, the world expected a finished\r\npiece; it was acted, and reprobated. The author, however, did not\r\nacutely feel its bad reception; he everywhere boasted that he, of all\r\nthe dramatists, had most scrupulously observed the _rules_ of Aristotle.\r\nThe Prince de Guemené, famous for his repartees, sarcastically observed,\r\n\"I do not quarrel with the Abbé d'Aubignac for having so closely\r\nfollowed the precepts of Aristotle; but I cannot pardon the precepts of\r\nAristotle, that occasioned the Abbé d'Aubignac to write so wretched a\r\ntragedy.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Pratique du Théâtre_ is not, however, to be despised, because the\r\n_Tragedy_ of its author is despicable.\r\n\r\nChapelain's unfortunate epic has rendered him notorious. He had gained,\r\nand not undeservedly, great reputation for his critical powers. After a\r\nretention of above thirty years, his _Pucelle_ appeared. He immediately\r\nbecame the butt of every unfledged wit, and his former works were\r\neternally condemned; insomuch that when Camusat published, after the\r\ndeath of our author, a little volume of extracts from his manuscript\r\nletters, it is curious to observe the awkward situation in which he\r\nfinds himself. In his preface he seems afraid that the very name of\r\nChapelain will be sufficient to repel the reader.\r\n\r\nCamusat observes of Chapelain, that \"he found flatterers, who assured\r\nhim his _Pucelle_ ranked above the Æneid; and this Chapelain but feebly\r\ndenied. However this may be, it would be difficult to make the bad\r\ntaste which reigns throughout this poem agree with that sound and exact\r\ncriticism with which he decided on the works of others. So true is it,\r\nthat _genius_ is very superior to a justness of mind which is\r\n_sufficient to judge_ and to advise others.\" Chapelain was ordered to\r\ndraw up a critical list of the chief living authors and men of letters\r\nin France, for the king. It is extremely impartial, and performed with\r\nan analytical skill of their literary characters which could not have\r\nbeen surpassed by an Aristotle or a Boileau.\r\n\r\nThe _talent of judging_ may exist separately from the _power of\r\nexecution_. An amateur may not be an artist, though an artist should be\r\nan amateur; and it is for this reason that young authors are not to\r\ncontemn the precepts of such critics as even the Abbé d'Aubignac and\r\nChapelain. It is to Walsh, a miserable versifier, that Pope stands\r\nindebted for the hint of our poetry then being deficient in correctness\r\nand polish; and it is from this fortunate hint that Pope derived his\r\npoetical excellence. Dionysius Halicarnassensis has composed a lifeless\r\nhistory; yet, as Gibbon observes, how admirably has _he_ judged the\r\nmasters, and defined the rules, of historical composition! Gravina, with\r\ngreat taste and spirit, has written on poetry and poets, but he composed\r\ntragedies which give him no title to be ranked among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTES OF CENSURED AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an ingenious observation made by a journalist of Trevoux, on\r\nperusing a criticism not ill written, which pretended to detect several\r\nfaults in the compositions of Bruyère, that in ancient Rome the great\r\nmen who triumphed amidst the applauses of those who celebrated their\r\nvirtues, were at the same time compelled to listen to those who\r\nreproached them with their vices. This custom is not less necessary to\r\nthe republic of letters than it was formerly to the republic of Rome.\r\nWithout this it is probable that authors would be intoxicated with\r\nsuccess, and would then relax in their accustomed vigour; and the\r\nmultitude who took them for models would, for want of judgment, imitate\r\ntheir defects.\r\n\r\nSterne and Churchill were continually abusing the Reviewers, because\r\nthey honestly told the one that obscenity was not wit, and obscurity was\r\nnot sense; and the other that dissonance in poetry did not excel\r\nharmony, and that his rhymes were frequently prose lines of ten\r\nsyllables cut into verse. They applauded their happier efforts.\r\nNotwithstanding all this, it is certain that so little discernment\r\nexists among common writers and common readers, that the obscenity and\r\nflippancy of Sterne, and the bald verse and prosaic poetry of Churchill,\r\nwere precisely the portion which they selected for imitation. The\r\nblemishes of great men are not the less blemishes, but they are,\r\nunfortunately, the easiest parts for imitation.\r\n\r\nYet criticism may be too rigorous, and genius too sensible to its direst\r\nattacks. Sir John Marsham, having published the first part of his\r\n\"Chronology,\" suffered so much chagrin at the endless controversies\r\nwhich it raised--and some of his critics went so far as to affirm it was\r\ndesigned to be detrimental to revelation--that he burned the second\r\npart, which was ready for the press. Pope was observed to writhe with\r\nanguish in his chair on hearing mentioned the letter of Cibber, with\r\nother temporary attacks; and it is said of Montesquieu, that he was so\r\nmuch affected by the criticisms, true and false, which he daily\r\nexperienced, that they contributed to hasten his death. Ritson's extreme\r\nirritability closed in lunacy, while ignorant Reviewers, in the shapes\r\nof assassins, were haunting his death-bed. In the preface to his\r\n\"Metrical Romances,\" he describes himself as \"brought to an end in ill\r\nhealth and low spirits--certain to be insulted by a base and prostitute\r\ngang of lurking assassins who stab in the dark, and whose poisoned\r\ndaggers he has already experienced.\" Scott, of Amwell, never recovered\r\nfrom a ludicrous criticism, which I discovered had been written by a\r\nphysician who never pretended to poetical taste.\r\n\r\nPelisson has recorded a literary anecdote, which forcibly shows the\r\ndanger of caustic criticism. A young man from a remote province came to\r\nParis with a play, which he considered as a masterpiece. M. L'Etoile was\r\nmore than just in his merciless criticism. He showed the youthful bard a\r\nthousand glaring defects in his chef-d'oeuvre. The humbled country\r\nauthor burnt his tragedy, returned home, took to his chamber, and died\r\nof vexation and grief. Of all unfortunate men, one of the unhappiest is\r\na middling author endowed with too lively a sensibility for criticism.\r\nAthenæus, in his tenth book, has given us a lively portrait of this\r\nmelancholy being. Anaxandrides appeared one day on horseback in the\r\npublic assembly at Athens, to recite a dithyrambic poem, of which he\r\nread a portion. He was a man of fine stature, and wore a purple robe\r\nedged with golden fringe. But his complexion was saturnine and\r\nmelancholy, which was the cause that he never spared his own writings.\r\nWhenever he was vanquished by a rival, he immediately gave his\r\ncompositions to the druggists to be cut into pieces to wrap their\r\narticles in, without ever caring to revise his writings. It is owing to\r\nthis that he destroyed a number of pleasing compositions; age increased\r\nhis sourness, and every day he became more and more dissatisfied with\r\nthe awards of his auditors. Hence his \"Tereus,\" because it failed to\r\nobtain the prize, has not reached us, which, with other of his\r\nproductions, deserved preservation, though they had missed the crown\r\nawarded by the public.\r\n\r\nBatteux having been chosen by the French government for the compilation\r\nof elementary hooks for the Military School, is said to have felt their\r\nunfavourable reception so acutely, that he became a prey to excessive\r\ngrief. The lamentable death of Dr. Hawkesworth was occasioned by a\r\nsimilar circumstance. Government had consigned to his care the\r\ncompilation of the voyages that pass under his name: how he succeeded is\r\nwell known. He felt the public reception so sensibly, that he preferred\r\nthe oblivion of death to the mortifying recollections of life.[113]\r\n\r\nOn this interesting subject Fontenelle, in his \"Eloge sur Newton,\" has\r\nmade the following observation:--\"Newton was more desirous of remaining\r\nunknown than of having the calm of life disturbed by those literary\r\nstorms which genius and science attract about those who rise to\r\neminence.\" In one of his letters we learn that his \"Treatise on Optics\"\r\nbeing ready for the press, several premature objections which appeared\r\nmade him abandon its publication. \"I should reproach myself,\" he said,\r\n\"for my imprudence, if I were to lose a thing so real as my ease to run\r\nafter a shadow.\" But this shadow he did not miss: it did not cost him\r\nthe ease he so much loved, and it had for him as much reality as ease\r\nitself. I refer to Bayle, in his curious article, \"Hipponax,\" note F. To\r\nthese instances we may add the fate of the Abbé Cassagne, a man of\r\nlearning, and not destitute of talents. He was intended for one of the\r\npreachers at court; but he had hardly made himself known in the pulpit,\r\nwhen he was struck by the lightning of Boileau's muse. He felt so\r\nacutely the caustic verses, that they rendered him almost incapable of\r\nliterary exertion; in the prime of life he became melancholy, and\r\nshortly afterwards died insane. A modern painter, it is known, never\r\nrecovered from the biting ridicule of a popular, but malignant wit.\r\nCummyns, a celebrated quaker, confessed he died of an anonymous letter\r\nin a public paper, which, said he, \"fastened on my heart, and threw me\r\ninto this slow fever.\" Racine, who died of his extreme sensibility to a\r\nroyal rebuke, confessed that the pain which one severe criticism\r\ninflicted outweighed all the applause he could receive. The feathered\r\narrow of an epigram has sometimes been wet with the heart's blood of its\r\nvictim. Fortune has been lost, reputation destroyed, and every charity\r\nof life extinguished, by the inhumanity of inconsiderate wit.\r\n\r\nLiterary history, even of our own days, records the fate of several who\r\nmay be said to have _died of Criticism_.[114] But there is more sense\r\nand infinite humour in the mode which Phædrus adopted to answer the\r\ncavillers of his age. When he first published his Fables, the taste for\r\nconciseness and simplicity were so much on the decline, that they were\r\nboth objected to him as faults. He used his critics as they deserved. To\r\nthose who objected against the _conciseness_ of his style, he tells a\r\nlong _tedious story_ (Lib. iii. Fab. 10, ver. 59), and treats those who\r\ncondemned the _simplicity_ of his style with a run of _bombast verses_,\r\nthat have a great many noisy elevated words in them, without any sense\r\nat the bottom--this in Lib. iv. Fab. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: The doctor was paid 6000_l._ to prepare the narrative of\r\nthe Voyages of Captain Cook from the rough notes. He indulged in much\r\npruriency of description, and occasional remarks savouring of\r\ninfidelity. They were loudly and generally condemned, and he died soon\r\nafterwards.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Keats is the most melancholy instance. The effect of the\r\nsevere criticism in the Quarterly Review upon his writings, is said by\r\nShelley to have \"appeared like madness, and he was with difficulty\r\nprevented from suicide.\" He never recovered its baneful effect; and when\r\nhe died in Rome, desired his epitaph might be, \"Here lies one whose name\r\nwas writ in water.\" The tombstone in the Protestant cemetery is\r\nnameless, and simply records that \"A young English poet\" lies there.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writings of the Fathers once formed the studies of the learned.\r\nThese labours abound with that subtilty of argument which will repay the\r\nindustry of the inquisitive, and the antiquary may turn them over for\r\npictures of the manners of the age. A favourite subject with Saint\r\nAmbrose was that of Virginity, on which he has several works; and\r\nperhaps he wished to revive the order of the vestals of ancient Rome,\r\nwhich afterwards produced the institution of Nuns. From his \"Treatise on\r\nVirgins,\" written in the fourth century, we learn the lively impressions\r\nhis exhortations had made on the minds and hearts of girls, not less in\r\nthe most distant provinces, than in the neighbourhood of Milan, where he\r\nresided. The Virgins of Bologna, amounting only, it appears, to the\r\nnumber of twenty, performed all kinds of needlework, not merely to gain\r\ntheir livelihood, but also to be enabled to perform acts of liberality,\r\nand exerted their industry to allure other girls to join the holy\r\nprofession of VIRGINITY. He exhorts daughters, in spite of their\r\nparents, and even their lovers, to consecrate themselves. \"I do not\r\nblame marriage,\" he says, \"I only show the advantages of VIRGINITY.\"\r\n\r\nHe composed this book in so florid a style, that he considered it\r\nrequired some apology. A Religious of the Benedictines published a\r\ntranslation in 1689.\r\n\r\nSo sensible was St. Ambrose of the _rarity_ of the profession he would\r\nestablish, that he thus combats his adversaries: \"They complain that\r\nhuman nature will be exhausted; but I ask, who has ever sought to marry\r\nwithout finding women enough from amongst whom he might choose? What\r\nmurder, or what war, has ever been occasioned for a virgin? It is one of\r\nthe consequences of marriage to kill the adulterer, and to war with the\r\nravisher.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote another treatise _On the perpetual Virginity of the Mother of\r\nGod_. He attacks Bonosius on this subject, and defends her virginity,\r\nwhich was indeed greatly suspected by Bonosius, who, however, incurred\r\nby this bold suspicion the anathema of _Heresy_. A third treatise was\r\nentitled _Exhortation to Virginity_; a fourth, _On the Fate of a\r\nVirgin_, is more curious. He relates the misfortunes of one _Susannah_,\r\nwho was by no means a companion for her namesake; for having made a vow\r\nof virginity, and taken the veil, she afterwards endeavoured to conceal\r\nher shame, but the precaution only tended to render her more culpable.\r\nHer behaviour, indeed, had long afforded ample food for the sarcasms of\r\nthe Jews and Pagans. Saint Ambrose compelled her to perform public\r\npenance, and after having declaimed on her double crime, gave her hopes\r\nof pardon, if, like \"Soeur Jeanne,\" this early nun would sincerely\r\nrepent: to complete her chastisement, he ordered her every day to recite\r\nthe fiftieth psalm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLANCE INTO THE FRENCH ACADEMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the republic of letters the establishment of an academy has been a\r\nfavourite project; yet perhaps it is little more than an Utopian scheme.\r\nThe united efforts of men of letters in Academies have produced little.\r\nIt would seem that no man likes to bestow his great labours on a small\r\ncommunity, for whose members he himself does not feel, probably, the\r\nmost flattering partiality. The French Academy made a splendid\r\nappearance in Europe; yet when this society published their Dictionary,\r\nthat of Furetière's became a formidable rival; and Johnson did as much\r\nas the _forty_ themselves. Voltaire confesses that the great characters\r\nof the literary republic were formed without the aid of academies.--\"For\r\nwhat then,\" he asks, \"are they necessary?--To preserve and nourish the\r\nfire which great geniuses have kindled.\" By observing the _Junto_ at\r\ntheir meetings we may form some opinion of the indolent manner in which\r\nthey trifled away their time. We are fortunately enabled to do this, by\r\na letter in which Patru describes, in a very amusing manner, the visit\r\nwhich Christina of Sweden took a sudden fancy to pay to the Academy.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Sweden suddenly resolved to visit the French Academy, and\r\ngave so short a notice of her design, that it was impossible to inform\r\nthe majority of the members of her intention. About four o'clock fifteen\r\nor sixteen academicians were assembled. M. Gombaut, who had never\r\nforgiven her majesty, because she did not relish his verses, thought\r\nproper to show his resentment by quitting the assembly.\r\n\r\nShe was received in a spacious hall. In the middle was a table covered\r\nwith rich blue velvet, ornamented with a broad border of gold and\r\nsilver. At its head was placed an armchair of black velvet embroidered\r\nwith gold, and round the table were placed chairs with tapestry backs.\r\nThe chancellor had forgotten to hang in the hall the portrait of the\r\nqueen, which she had presented to the Academy, and which was considered\r\nas a great omission. About five, a footman belonging to the queen\r\ninquired if the company were assembled. Soon after, a servant of the\r\nking informed the chancellor that the queen was at the end of the\r\nstreet; and immediately her carriage drew up in the court-yard. The\r\nchancellor, followed by the rest of the members, went to receive her as\r\nshe stepped out of her chariot; but the crowd was so great, that few of\r\nthem could reach her majesty. Accompanied by the chancellor, she passed\r\nthrough the first hall, followed by one of her ladies, the captain of\r\nher guards, and one or two of her suite.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered the Academy she approached the fire, and spoke in a low\r\nvoice to the chancellor. She then asked why M. Menage was not there? and\r\nwhen she was told that he did not belong to the Academy, she asked why\r\nhe did not? She was answered, that, however he might merit the honour,\r\nhe had rendered himself unworthy of it by several disputes he had had\r\nwith its members. She then inquired aside of the chancellor whether the\r\nacademicians were to sit or stand before her? On this the chancellor\r\nconsulted with a member, who observed that in the time of Ronsard, there\r\nwas held an assembly of men of letters before Charles IX. several times,\r\nand that they were always seated. The queen conversed with M. Bourdelot;\r\nand suddenly turning to Madame de Bregis, told her that she believed she\r\nmust not be present at the assembly; but it was agreed that this lady\r\ndeserved the honour. As the queen was talking with a member she abruptly\r\nquitted him, as was her custom, and in her quick way sat down in the\r\narm-chair; and at the same time the members seated themselves. The queen\r\nobserving that they did not, out of respect to her, approach the table,\r\ndesired them to come near; and they accordingly approached it.\r\n\r\nDuring these ceremonious preparations several officers of state had\r\nentered the hall, and stood behind the academicians. The chancellor sat\r\nat the queen's left hand by the fire-side; and at the right was placed\r\nM. de la Chambre, the director; then Boisrobert, Patru, Pelisson, Cotin,\r\nthe Abbé Tallemant, and others. M. de Mezeray sat at the bottom of the\r\ntable facing the queen, with an inkstand, paper, and the portfolio of\r\nthe company lying before him: he occupied the place of the secretary.\r\nWhen they were all seated the director rose, and the academicians\r\nfollowed him, all but the chancellor, who remained in his seat. The\r\ndirector made his complimentary address in a low voice, his body was\r\nquite bent, and no person but the queen and the chancellor could hear\r\nhim. She received his address with great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAll compliments concluded, they returned to their seats. The director\r\nthen told the queen that he had composed a treatise on Pain, to add to\r\nhis character of the Passions, and if it was agreeable to her majesty,\r\nhe would read the first chapter.--\"Very willingly,\" she answered. Having\r\nread it, he said to her majesty, that he would read no more lest he\r\nshould fatigue her. \"Not at all,\" she replied, \"for I suppose what\r\nfollows is like what I have heard.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Mezeray observed that M. Cotin had some verses, which her majesty\r\nwould doubtless find beautiful, and if it was agreeable they should be\r\nread. M. Cotin read them: they were versions of two passages from\r\nLucretius: the one in which he attacks a Providence, and the other,\r\nwhere he gives the origin of the world according to the Epicurean\r\nsystem: to these he added twenty lines of his own, in which he\r\nmaintained the existence of a Providence. This done, an abbé rose, and,\r\nwithout being desired or ordered, read two sonnets, which by courtesy\r\nwere allowed to be tolerable. It is remarkable that both the _poets_\r\nread their verses standing, while the rest read their compositions\r\nseated.\r\n\r\nAfter these readings, the director informed the queen that the ordinary\r\nexercise of the company was to labour on the dictionary; and that if her\r\nmajesty should not find it disagreeable, they would read a _cahier_.\r\n\"Very willingly,\" she answered. M. de Mezeray then read what related to\r\nthe word _Jeu; Game_. Amongst other proverbial expressions was this:\r\n_Game of Princes, which only pleases the player_, to express a malicious\r\nviolence committed by one in power. At this the queen laughed heartily;\r\nand they continued reading all that was fairly written. This lasted\r\nabout an hour, when the queen observing that nothing more remained,\r\narose, made a bow to the company, and returned in the manner she\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nFuretière, who was himself an academician, has described the miserable\r\nmanner in which time was consumed at their assemblies. I confess he was\r\na satirist, and had quarrelled with the Academy; there must have been,\r\nnotwithstanding, sufficient resemblance for the following picture,\r\nhowever it may be overcharged. He has been blamed for thus exposing the\r\nEleusinian mysteries of literature to the uninitiated.\r\n\r\n\"He who is most clamorous, is he whom they suppose has most reason. They\r\nall have the art of making long orations upon a trifle. The second\r\nrepeats like an echo what the first said; but generally three or four\r\nspeak together. When there is a bench of five or six members, one reads,\r\nanother decides, two converse, one sleeps, and another amuses himself\r\nwith reading some dictionary which happens to lie before him. When a\r\nsecond member is to deliver his opinion, they are obliged to read again\r\nthe article, which at the first perusal he had been too much engaged to\r\nhear. This is a happy manner of finishing their work. They can hardly\r\nget over two lines without long digressions; without some one telling a\r\npleasant story, or the news of the day; or talking of affairs of state,\r\nand reforming the government.\"\r\n\r\nThat the French Academy were generally frivolously employed appears also\r\nfrom an epistle to Balzac, by Boisrobert, the amusing companion of\r\nCardinal Richelieu. \"Every one separately,\" says he, \"promises great\r\nthings; when they meet they do nothing. They have been _six years_\r\nemployed on the letter F; and I should be happy if I were certain of\r\nliving till they got through G.\"\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote concerns the _forty arm-chairs_ of the\r\nacademicians.[115] Those cardinals who were academicians for a long time\r\nhad not attended the meetings of the Academy, because they thought that\r\n_arm-chairs_ were indispensable to their dignity, and the Academy had\r\nthen only common chairs. These cardinals were desirous of being present\r\nat the election of M. Monnoie, that they might give him a distinguished\r\nmark of their esteem. \"The king,\" says D'Alembert, \"to satisfy at once\r\nthe delicacy of their friendship, and that of their cardinalship, and to\r\npreserve at the same time that academical equality, of which this\r\nenlightened monarch (Louis XIV.) well knew the advantage, sent to the\r\nAcademy forty arm-chairs for the forty academicians, the same chairs\r\nwhich we now occupy; and the motive to which we owe them is sufficient\r\nto render the memory of Louis XIV. precious to the republic of letters,\r\nto whom it owes so many more important obligations!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: A very clever satire has been concocted in an imaginary\r\nhistory of \"a forty-first chair\" of the Academy which has been occupied\r\nby the great men of literature who have not been recognised members of\r\nthe official body, and whose \"existence there has been unaccountably\r\nforgotten\" in the annals of its members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETICAL AND GRAMMATICAL DEATHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will appear by the following anecdotes, that some men may be said to\r\nhave died _poetically_ and even _grammatically_.\r\n\r\nThere must be some attraction existing in poetry which is not merely\r\nfictitious, for often have its genuine votaries felt all its powers on\r\nthe most trying occasions. They have displayed the energy of their mind\r\nby composing or repeating verses, even with death on their lips.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Adrian, dying, made that celebrated address to his soul,\r\nwhich is so happily translated by Pope. Lucan, when he had his veins\r\nopened by order of Nero, expired reciting a passage from his Pharsalia,\r\nin which he had described the wound of a dying soldier. Petronius did\r\nthe same thing on the same occasion.\r\n\r\nPatris, a poet of Caen, perceiving himself expiring, composed some\r\nverses which are justly admired. In this little poem he relates a dream,\r\nin which he appeared to be placed next to a beggar, when, having\r\naddressed him in the haughty strain he would probably have employed on\r\nthis side of the grave, he receives the following reprimand:--\r\n\r\n    Ici tous sont égaux; je ne te dois plus rien;\r\n    Je suis sur mon fumier comme toi sur le tien.\r\n\r\n    Here all are equal! now thy lot is mine!\r\n    I on my dunghill, as thou art on thine.\r\n\r\nDes Barreaux, it is said, wrote on his death-bed that well-known sonnet\r\nwhich is translated in the \"Spectator.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret of Austria, when she was nearly perishing in a storm at sea,\r\ncomposed her epitaph in verse. Had she perished, what would have become\r\nof the epitaph? And if she escaped, of what use was it? She should\r\nrather have said her prayers. The verses however have all the _naïveté_\r\nof the times. They are--\r\n\r\n    Cy gist Margot, la gente demoiselle,\r\n    Qu'eut deux maris, et si mourut pucelle.\r\n\r\n    Beneath this tomb is high-born Margaret laid,\r\n    Who had two husbands, and yet died a maid.\r\n\r\nShe was betrothed to Charles VIII. of France, who forsook her; and being\r\nnext intended for the Spanish infant, in her voyage to Spain, she wrote\r\nthese lines in a storm.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Serment was surnamed the philosopher. She was celebrated\r\nfor her knowledge and taste in polite literature. She died of a cancer\r\nin her breast, and suffered her misfortune with exemplary patience. She\r\nexpired in finishing these verses, which she addressed to Death:--\r\n\r\n                      Nectare clausa suo,\r\n    Dignum tantorum pretium tulit illa laborum.\r\n\r\nIt was after Cervantes had received extreme unction that he wrote the\r\ndedication of his Persiles.\r\n\r\nRoscommon, at the moment he expired, with an energy of voice that\r\nexpressed the most fervent devotion, uttered two lines of his own\r\nversion of \"Dies Iræ!\" Waller, in his last moments, repeated some lines\r\nfrom Virgil; and Chaucer seems to have taken his farewell of all human\r\nvanities by a moral ode, entitled, \"A balade made by Geffrey Chaucyer\r\nupon his dethe-bedde lying in his grete anguysse.\"[116]\r\n\r\nCornelius de Witt fell an innocent victim to popular prejudice. His\r\ndeath is thus noticed by Hume:--\"This man, who had bravely served his\r\ncountry in war, and who had been invested with the highest dignities,\r\nwas delivered into the hands of the executioner, and torn in pieces by\r\nthe most inhuman torments. Amidst the severe agonies which he endured he\r\nfrequently repeated an ode of Horace, which contained sentiments suited\r\nto his deplorable condition.\" It was the third ode of the third book\r\nwhich this illustrious philosopher and statesman then repeated.\r\n\r\nMetastasio, after receiving the sacrament, a very short time before his\r\nlast moments, broke out with all the enthusiasm of poetry and religion\r\nin these stanzas:--\r\n\r\n        T' offro il tuo proprio Figlio,\r\n          Che già d'amore in pegno,\r\n          Racchiuso in picciol segno\r\n          Si volle a noi donar.\r\n\r\n        A lui rivolgi il ciglio.\r\n          Guardo chi t' offro, e poi\r\n          Lasci, Signor, se vuoi,\r\n          Lascia di perdonar.\r\n\r\n     \"I offer to thee, O Lord, thine own Son, who already has given the\r\n     pledge of love, enclosed in this thin emblem. Turn on him thine\r\n     eyes: ah! behold whom I offer to thee, and then desist, O Lord! if\r\n     thou canst desist from mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The muse that has attended my course,\" says the dying Gleim in a letter\r\nto Klopstock, \"still hovers round my steps to the very verge of the\r\ngrave.\" A collection of lyrical poems, entitled \"Last Hours,\" composed\r\nby old Gleim on his death-bed, was intended to be published. The death\r\nof Klopstock was one of the most poetical: in this poet's \"Messiah,\" he\r\nhad made the death of Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, a picture\r\nof the death of the Just; and on his own death-bed he was heard\r\nrepeating, with an expiring voice, his own verses on Mary; he was\r\nexhorting himself to die by the accents of his own harp, the sublimities\r\nof his own muse! The same song of Mary was read at the public funeral of\r\nKlopstock.\r\n\r\nChatelar, a French gentleman, beheaded in Scotland for having loved the\r\nqueen, and even for having attempted her honour, Brantome says, would\r\nnot have any other viaticum than a poem of Ronsard. When he ascended the\r\nscaffold he took the hymns of this poet, and for his consolation read\r\nthat on death, which our old critic says is well adapted to conquer its\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nWhen the Marquis of Montrose was condemned by his judges to have his\r\nlimbs nailed to the gates of four cities, the brave soldier said that\r\n\"he was sorry he had not limbs sufficient to be nailed to all the gates\r\nof the cities in Europe, as monuments of his loyalty.\" As he proceeded\r\nto his execution, he put this thought into verse.\r\n\r\nPhilip Strozzi, imprisoned by Cosmo the First, Great Duke of Tuscany,\r\nwas apprehensive of the danger to which he might expose his friends who\r\nhad joined in his conspiracy against the duke, from the confessions\r\nwhich the rack might extort from him. Having attempted every exertion\r\nfor the liberty of his country, he considered it as no crime therefore\r\nto die. He resolved on suicide. With the point of the sword, with which\r\nhe killed himself, he cut out on the mantel-piece of the chimney this\r\nverse of Virgil:--\r\n\r\n    Exoriare aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor.\r\n    Rise some avenger from our blood!\r\n\r\nI can never repeat without a strong emotion the following stanzas, begun\r\nby André Chenier, in the dreadful period of the French revolution. He\r\nwas waiting for his turn to be dragged to the guillotine, when he\r\ncommenced this poem:--\r\n\r\n    Comme un dernier rayon, comme un dernier zéphyre\r\n        Anime la fin d'un beau jour;\r\n    Au pied de l'échafaud j'essaie encore ma lyre,\r\n        Peut-être est ce bientôt mon tour;\r\n\r\n    Peut-être avant que l'heure en cercle promenée\r\n        Ait posé sur l'émail brillant,\r\n    Dans les soixante pas où sa route est bornée\r\n        Son pied sonore et vigilant,\r\n\r\n    Le sommeil du tombeau pressera ma paupière--\r\n\r\nHere, at this pathetic line, was André Chenier summoned to the\r\nguillotine! Never was a more beautiful effusion of grief interrupted by\r\na more affecting incident!\r\n\r\nSeveral men of science have died in a scientific manner. Haller, the\r\npoet, philosopher, and physician, beheld his end approach with the\r\nutmost composure. He kept feeling his pulse to the last moment, and when\r\nhe found that life was almost gone, he turned to his brother physician,\r\nobserving, \"My friend, the artery ceases to beat,\" and almost instantly\r\nexpired. The same remarkable circumstance had occurred to the great\r\nHarvey: he kept making observations on the state of his pulse, when life\r\nwas drawing to its close, \"as if,\" says Dr. Wilson, in the oration\r\nspoken a few days after the event, \"that he who had taught us the\r\nbeginning of life might himself, at his departing from it, become\r\nacquainted with those of death.\"\r\n\r\nDe Lagny, who was intended by his friends for the study of the law,\r\nhaving fallen on an Euclid, found it so congenial to his dispositions,\r\nthat he devoted himself to mathematics. In his last moments, when he\r\nretained no further recollection of the friends who surrounded his bed,\r\none of them, perhaps to make a philosophical experiment, thought proper\r\nto ask him the square of twelve: our dying mathematician instantly, and\r\nperhaps without knowing that he answered, replied, \"One hundred and\r\nforty-four.\"\r\n\r\nThe following anecdotes are of a different complexion, and may excite a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nPère Bohours was a French grammarian, who had been justly accused of\r\npaying too scrupulous an attention to the minutiæ of letters. He was\r\nmore solicitous of his _words_ than his _thoughts_. It is said, that\r\nwhen he was dying, he called out to his friends (a correct grammarian to\r\nthe last), \"_Je_ VAS _ou je_ VAIS _mourir; l'un ou l'autre se dit_!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Malherbe was dying, he reprimanded his nurse for making use of a\r\nsolecism in her language; and when his confessor represented to him the\r\nfelicities of a future state in low and trite expressions, the dying\r\ncritic interrupted him:--\"Hold your tongue,\" he said; \"your wretched\r\nstyle only makes me out of conceit with them!\"\r\n\r\nThe favourite studies and amusements of the learned La Mothe le Vayer\r\nconsisted in accounts of the most distant countries. He gave a striking\r\nproof of the influence of this master-passion, when death hung upon his\r\nlips. Bernier, the celebrated traveller, entering and drawing the\r\ncurtains of his bed to take his eternal farewell, the dying man turning\r\nto him, with a faint voice inquired, \"Well, my friend, what news from\r\nthe Great Mogul?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Barham, the author of the _Ingoldsby Legends_, wrote a\r\nsimilar death-bed lay in imitation of the older poets. It is termed \"As\r\nI laye a-thinkynge.\" Bewick, the wood-engraver, was last employed upon,\r\nand left unfinished at his death, a cut, the subject of which was \"The\r\nold Horse waiting for Death.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarron, as a burlesque poet, but no other comparison exists, had his\r\nmerit, but is now little read; for the uniformity of the burlesque style\r\nis as intolerable as the uniformity of the serious. From various sources\r\nwe may collect some uncommon anecdotes, although he was a mere author.\r\n\r\nHis father, a counsellor, having married a second wife, the lively\r\nScarron became the object of her hatred.\r\n\r\nHe studied, and travelled, and took the clerical tonsure; but discovered\r\ndispositions more suitable to the pleasures of his age than to the\r\ngravity of his profession. He formed an acquaintance with the wits of\r\nthe times; and in the carnival of 1638 committed a youthful\r\nextravagance, for which his remaining days formed a continual\r\npunishment. He disguised himself as a savage; the singularity of a naked\r\nman attracted crowds. After having been hunted by the mob, he was forced\r\nto escape from his pursuers; and concealed himself in a marsh. A\r\nfreezing cold seized him, and threw him, at the age of twenty-seven\r\nyears, into a kind of palsy; a cruel disorder which tormented him all\r\nhis life. \"It was thus,\" he says, \"that pleasure deprived me suddenly of\r\nlegs which had danced with elegance, and of hands, which could manage\r\nthe pencil and the lute.\"\r\n\r\nGoujet, without stating this anecdote, describes his disorder as an\r\nacrid humour, distilling itself on his nerves, and baffling the skill of\r\nhis physicians; the sciatica, rheumatism, in a word, a complication of\r\nmaladies attacked him, sometimes successively, sometimes together, and\r\nmade of our poor Abbé a sad spectacle. He thus describes himself in one\r\nof his letters; and who could be in better humour?\r\n\r\n\"I have lived to thirty: if I reach forty, I shall only add many\r\nmiseries to those which I have endured these last eight or nine years.\r\nMy person was well made, though short; my disorder has shortened it\r\nstill more by a foot. My head is a little broad for my shape; my face is\r\nfull enough for my body to appear very meagre; I have hair enough to\r\nrender a wig unnecessary; I have got many white hairs, in spite of the\r\nproverb. My teeth, formerly square pearls, are now of the colour of\r\nwood, and will soon be of slate. My legs and thighs first formed an\r\nobtuse angle, afterwards an equilateral angle, and at length, an acute\r\none. My thighs and body form another; and my head, always dropping on my\r\nbreast, makes me not ill represent a Z. I have got my arms shortened as\r\nwell as my legs, and my fingers as well as my arms. In a word, I am an\r\nabridgment of human miseries.\"\r\n\r\nHe had the free use of nothing but his tongue and his hands; and he\r\nwrote on a portfolio placed on his knees.\r\n\r\nBalzac said of Scarron, that he had gone further in insensibility than\r\nthe Stoics, who were satisfied in appearing insensible to pain; but\r\nScarron was gay, and amused all the world with his sufferings.\r\n\r\nHe pourtrays himself thus humorously in his address to the queen:--\r\n\r\n           Je ne regard plus qu'en bas,\r\n       Je suis torticolis, j'ai la tête penchante;\r\n           Ma mine devient si plaisante\r\n    Que quand on en riroit, je ne m'en plaindrois pas.\r\n\r\n     \"I can only see under me; I am wry-necked; my head hangs down; my\r\n     appearance is so droll, that if people laugh, I shall not\r\n     complain.\"\r\n\r\nHe says elsewhere,\r\n\r\n    Parmi les torticolis\r\n    Je passe pour un des plus jolis.\r\n\r\n     \"Among your wry-necked people I pass for one of the handsomest.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having suffered this distortion of shape, and these acute pains\r\nfor four years, he quitted his usual residence, the quarter du Marais,\r\nfor the baths of the Fauxbourg Saint Germain. He took leave of his\r\nfriends, by addressing some verses to them, entitled, _Adieu aux\r\nMarais_; in which he describes several celebrated persons. When he was\r\nbrought into the street in a chair, the pleasure of seeing himself there\r\nonce more overcame the pains which the motion occasioned, and he has\r\ncelebrated the transport by an ode, which has for title, \"The Way from\r\nle Marais to the Fauxbourg Saint Germain.\"\r\n\r\nThe baths he tried had no effect on his miserable disorder. But a new\r\naffliction was added to the catalogue of his griefs.\r\n\r\nHis father, who had hitherto contributed to his necessities, having\r\njoined a party against Cardinal Richelieu, was exiled. This affair was\r\nrendered still more unfortunate by his mother-in-law with her children\r\nat Paris, in the absence of her husband, appropriating the property of\r\nthe family to her own use.\r\n\r\nHitherto Scarron had had no connexion with Cardinal Richelieu. The\r\nconduct of his father had even rendered his name disagreeable to the\r\nminister, who was by no means prone to forgiveness. Scarron, however,\r\nwhen he thought his passion moderated, ventured to present a petition,\r\nwhich is considered by the critics as one of his happiest productions.\r\nRichelieu permitted it to be read to him, and acknowledged that it\r\nafforded him much pleasure, and that it was _pleasantly dated_. This\r\n_pleasant date_ is thus given by Scarron:--\r\n\r\n    Fait à Paris dernier jour d'Octobre,\r\n    Par moi, Scarron, qui malgre moi suis sobre,\r\n    L'an que l'on prit le fameux Perpignan,\r\n    Et, sans canon, la ville de Sedan.\r\n\r\n    At Paris done, the last day of October,\r\n    By me, Scarron, who wanting wine am sober,\r\n    The year they took fam'd Perpignan,\r\n    And, without cannon-ball, Sedan.\r\n\r\nThis was flattering the minister adroitly in two points very agreeable\r\nto him. The poet augured well of the dispositions of the cardinal, and\r\nlost no time to return to the charge, by addressing an ode to him, to\r\nwhich he gave the title of THANKS, as if he had already received the\r\nfavours which he hoped he should receive! Thus Ronsard dedicated to\r\nCatherine of Medicis, who was prodigal of promises, his hymn to\r\nPROMISE. But all was lost for Scarron by the death of the Cardinal.\r\n\r\nWhen Scarron's father died, he brought his mother-in-law into court;\r\nand, to complete his misfortunes, lost his suit. The cases which he drew\r\nup for the occasion were so extremely burlesque, that the world could\r\nnot easily conceive how a man could amuse himself so pleasantly on a\r\nsubject on which his existence depended.\r\n\r\nThe successor of Richelieu, the Cardinal Mazarin, was insensible to his\r\napplications. He did nothing for him, although the poet dedicated to him\r\nhis _Typhon_, a burlesque poem, in which the author describes the wars\r\nof the giants with the gods. Our bard was so irritated at this neglect,\r\nthat he suppressed a sonnet he had written in his favour, and aimed at\r\nhim several satirical bullets. Scarron, however, consoled himself for\r\nthis kind of disgrace with those select friends who were not inconstant\r\nin their visits to him. The Bishop of Mans also, solicited by a friend,\r\ngave him a living in his diocese. When Scarron had taken possession of\r\nit, he began his _Roman Comique_, ill translated into English by\r\n_Comical Romance_. He made friends by his dedications. Such resources\r\nwere indeed necessary, for he not only lived well, but had made his\r\nhouse an asylum for his two sisters, who there found refuge from an\r\nunfeeling step-mother.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the beautiful and accomplished Mademoiselle\r\nd'Aubigné, afterwards so well known by the name of Madame de Maintenon,\r\nshe who was to be one day the mistress, if not the queen of France,\r\nformed with Scarron the most romantic connexion. She united herself in\r\nmarriage with one whom she well knew could only be a lover. It was\r\nindeed amidst that literary society she formed her taste and embellished\r\nwith her presence his little residence, where assembled the most\r\npolished courtiers and some of the finest geniuses of Paris of that\r\nfamous party, called _La Fronde_, formed against Mazarin. Such was the\r\ninfluence this marriage had over Scarron, that after this period his\r\nwritings became more correct and more agreeable than those which he had\r\npreviously composed. Scarron, on his side, gave a proof of his\r\nattachment to Madame de Maintenon; for by marrying her he lost his\r\nliving of Mans. But though without wealth, he was accustomed to say that\r\n\"his wife and he would not live uncomfortable by the produce of his\r\nestate and the _Marquisate of Quinet_.\" Thus he called the revenue which\r\nhis compositions produced, and _Quinet_ was his bookseller.\r\n\r\nScarron addressed one of his dedications to his dog, to ridicule those\r\nwriters who dedicate their works indiscriminately, though no author has\r\nbeen more liberal of dedications than himself; but, as he confessed, he\r\nmade dedication a kind of business. When he was low in cash he always\r\ndedicated to some lord, whom he praised as warmly as his dog, but whom\r\nprobably he did not esteem as much.\r\n\r\nWhen Scarron was visited, previous to general conversation his friends\r\nwere taxed with a perusal of what he had written since he saw them last.\r\nSegrais and a friend calling on him, \"Take a chair,\" said our author,\r\n\"and let me _try on you_ my 'Roman Comique.'\" He took his manuscript,\r\nread several pages, and when he observed that they laughed, he said,\r\n\"Good, this goes well; my book can't fail of success, since it obliges\r\nsuch able persons as yourselves to laugh;\" and then remained silent to\r\nreceive their compliments. He used to call this _trying on his romance_,\r\nas a tailor _tries_ his _coat_. He was agreeable and diverting in all\r\nthings, even in his complaints and passions. Whatever he conceived he\r\nimmediately too freely expressed; but his amiable lady corrected him of\r\nthis in three months after marriage.\r\n\r\nHe petitioned the queen, in his droll manner, to be permitted the honour\r\nof being her _Sick-Man by right of office_. These verses form a part of\r\nhis address to her majesty:\r\n\r\n    Scarron, par la grace de Dieu,\r\n    Malade indigne de la reine,\r\n    Homme n'ayant ni feu, ni lieu,\r\n    Mais bien du mal et de la peine;\r\n    Hôpital allant et venant,\r\n    Des jambes d'autrui cheminant,\r\n    Des sieunes n'ayant plus l'usage,\r\n    Souffrant beaucoup, dormant bien pen,\r\n    Et pourtant faisant par courage\r\n    Bonne mine et fort mauvais jeu.\r\n\r\n    \"Scarron, by the grace of God, the unworthy Sick-Man of the Queen;\r\n    a man without a house, though a moving hospital of disorders;\r\n    walking only with other people's legs, with great sufferings, but\r\n    little sleep; and yet, in spite of all, very courageously showing a\r\n    hearty countenance, though indeed he plays a losing game.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, granted the title, and, what was better, added a small\r\npension, which losing, by lampooning the minister Mazarin, Fouquet\r\ngenerously granted him a more considerable one.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the miseries of this facetious genius was now\r\napproaching. To one of his friends, who was taking leave of him for some\r\ntime, Scarron said, \"I shall soon die; the only regret I have in dying\r\nis not to be enabled to leave some property to my wife, who is possessed\r\nof infinite merit, and whom I have every reason imaginable to admire and\r\nto praise.\"\r\n\r\nOne day he was seized with so violent a fit of the hiccough, that his\r\nfriends now considered his prediction would soon be verified. When it\r\nwas over, \"If ever I recover,\" cried Scarron, \"I will write a bitter\r\nsatire against the hiccough.\" The satire, however, was never written,\r\nfor he died soon after. A little before his death, when he observed his\r\nrelations and domestics weeping and groaning, he was not much affected,\r\nbut humorously told them, \"My children, you will never weep for me so\r\nmuch as I have made you laugh.\" A few moments before he died, he said,\r\nthat \"he never thought that it was so easy a matter to laugh at the\r\napproach of death.\"\r\n\r\nThe burlesque compositions of Scarron are now neglected by the French.\r\nThis species of writing was much in vogue till attacked by the critical\r\nBoileau, who annihilated such puny writers as D'Assoucy and Dulot, with\r\ntheir stupid admirers. It is said he spared Scarron because his merit,\r\nthough it appeared but at intervals, was uncommon. Yet so much were\r\nburlesque verses the fashion after Scarron's works, that the booksellers\r\nwould not publish poems, but with the word \"Burlesque\" in the\r\ntitle-page. In 1649 appeared a poem, which shocked the pious, entitled,\r\n\"The Passion of our Lord, in _burlesque Verses_.\"\r\n\r\nSwift, in his dotage, appears to have been gratified by such puerilities\r\nas Scarron frequently wrote. An ode which Swift calls \"A Lilliputian\r\nOde,\" consisting of verses of three syllables, probably originated in a\r\nlong epistle in verses of three syllables, which Scarron addressed to\r\nSarrazin. It is pleasant, and the following lines will serve as a\r\nspecimen:--\r\n\r\n_Epître à M. Sarrazin._\r\n\r\n        Sarrazin\r\n        Mon voisin,\r\n        Cher ami,\r\n        Qu'à demi,\r\n        Je ne voi,\r\n        Dont ma foi\r\n        J'ai dépit\r\n        Un petit.\r\n        N'es-tu pas\r\n        Barrabas,\r\n        Busiris,\r\n        Phalaris,\r\n        Ganelon,\r\n        Le Felon?\r\n\r\nHe describes himself--\r\n\r\n    Un pauvret,\r\n    Très maigret;\r\n    Au col tors,\r\n    Dont le corps\r\n    Tout tortu,\r\n    Tout bossu,\r\n    Suranné,\r\n    Décharné,\r\n    Est réduit,\r\n    Jour et nuit,\r\n    A souffrir\r\n    Sans guérir\r\n    Des tourmens\r\n    Vehemens.\r\n\r\nHe complains of Sarrazin's not visiting him, threatens to reduce him\r\ninto powder if he comes not quickly; and concludes,\r\n\r\n    Mais pourtant,\r\n    Repentant\r\n    Si tu viens\r\n    Et tu tiens\r\n    Settlement\r\n    Un moment\r\n    Avec nous,\r\n    Mon courroux\r\n    Finira,\r\n    ET CÆTERA.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Comique of our author abounds with pleasantry, with wit and\r\ncharacter. His \"Virgile Travestie\" it is impossible to read long: this\r\nwe likewise feel in \"Cotton's Virgil travestied,\" which has\r\nnotwithstanding considerable merit. Buffoonery after a certain time\r\nexhausts our patience. It is the chaste actor only who can keep the\r\nattention awake for a length of time. It is said that Scarron intended\r\nto write a tragedy; this perhaps would not have been the least facetious\r\nof his burlesques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER CORNEILLE.\r\n\r\n    Exact Racine and Corneille's noble fire\r\n    Show'd us that France had something to admire.\r\n\r\n                                          POPE.\r\n\r\nThe great Corneille having finished his studies, devoted himself to the\r\nbar; but this was not the stage on which his abilities were to be\r\ndisplayed. He followed the occupation of a lawyer for some time, without\r\ntaste and without success. A trifling circumstance discovered to the\r\nworld and to himself a different genius. A young man who was in love\r\nwith a girl of the same town, having solicited him to be his companion\r\nin one of those secret visits which he paid to the lady, it happened\r\nthat the stranger pleased infinitely more than his introducer. The\r\npleasure arising from this adventure excited in Corneille a talent which\r\nhad hitherto been unknown to him, and he attempted, as if it were by\r\ninspiration, dramatic poetry. On this little subject he wrote his comedy\r\nof Mélite, in 1625. At that moment the French drama was at a low ebb:\r\nthe most favourable ideas were formed of our juvenile poet, and comedy,\r\nit was expected, would now reach its perfection. After the tumult of\r\napprobation had ceased, the critics thought that Mélite was too simple\r\nand barren of incident. Roused by this criticism, our poet wrote his\r\nClitandre, and in that piece has scattered incidents and adventures with\r\nsuch a licentious profusion, that the critics say he wrote it rather to\r\nexpose the public taste than to accommodate himself to it. In this piece\r\nthe persons combat on the theatre; there are murders and assassinations;\r\nheroines fight; officers appear in search of murderers, and women are\r\ndisguised as men. There is matter sufficient for a romance of ten\r\nvolumes; \"And yet,\" says a French critic, \"nothing can be more cold and\r\ntiresome.\" He afterwards indulged his natural genius in various other\r\nperformances; but began to display more forcibly his tragic powers in\r\nMedea. A comedy which he afterwards wrote was a very indifferent\r\ncomposition. He regained his full lustre in the famous Cid, a tragedy,\r\nof which he preserved in his closet translations in all the European\r\nlanguages, except the Sclavonian and the Turkish. He pursued his\r\npoetical career with uncommon splendour in the Horaces, Cinna, and at\r\nlength in Polyeucte; which productions, the French critics say, can\r\nnever be surpassed.\r\n\r\nAt length the tragedy of \"Pertharite\" appeared, and proved unsuccessful.\r\nThis so much disgusted our veteran bard, that, like Ben Jonson, he could\r\nnot conceal his chagrin in the preface. There the poet tells us that he\r\nrenounces the theatre for ever! and indeed this _eternity_ lasted for\r\n_several years_!\r\n\r\nDisgusted by the fate of his unfortunate tragedy, he directed his\r\npoetical pursuits to a different species of composition. He now finished\r\nhis translation in verse, of the \"Imitation of Jesus Christ,\" by Thomas\r\nà Kempis. This work, perhaps from the singularity of its dramatic author\r\nbecoming a religious writer, was attended with astonishing success. Yet\r\nFontenelle did not find in this translation the prevailing charm of the\r\noriginal, which consists in that simplicity and _naïveté_ which are lost\r\nin the pomp of versification so natural to Corneille. \"This book,\" he\r\ncontinues, \"the finest that ever proceeded from the hand of man (since\r\nthe gospel does not come from man) would not go so direct to the heart,\r\nand would not seize on it with such force, if it had not a natural and\r\ntender air, to which even that negligence which prevails in the style\r\ngreatly contributes.\" Voltaire appears to confirm the opinion of our\r\ncritic, in respect to the translation: \"It is reported that Corneille's\r\ntranslation of the Imitation of Jesus Christ has been printed thirty-two\r\ntimes; it is as difficult to believe this as it is to _read the book\r\nonce_!\"\r\n\r\nCorneille seems not to have been ignorant of the truth of this\r\ncriticism. In his dedication to the Pope, he says, \"The translation\r\nwhich I have chosen, by the simplicity of its style, precludes all the\r\nrich ornaments of poetry, and far from increasing my reputation, must be\r\nconsidered rather as a sacrifice made to the glory of the Sovereign\r\nAuthor of all, which I may have acquired by my poetical productions.\"\r\nThis is an excellent elucidation of the truth of that precept of Johnson\r\nwhich respects religious poetry; but of which the author of \"Calvary\"\r\nseemed not to have been sensible. The merit of religious compositions\r\nappears, like this \"Imitation of Jesus Christ,\" to consist in a\r\nsimplicity inimical to the higher poetical embellishments; these are too\r\nhuman!\r\n\r\nWhen Racine, the son, published a long poem on \"Grace,\" taken in its\r\nholy sense, a most unhappy subject at least for poetry; it was said that\r\nhe had written on _Grace_ without _grace_.\r\n\r\nDuring the space of six years Corneille rigorously kept his promise of\r\nnot writing for the theatre. At length, overpowered by the persuasions\r\nof his friends, and probably by his own inclinations, he once more\r\ndirected his studies to the drama. He recommenced in 1659, and finished\r\nin 1675. During this time he wrote ten new pieces, and published a\r\nvariety of little religious poems, which, although they do not attract\r\nthe attention of posterity, were then read with delight, and probably\r\npreferred to the finest tragedies by the good catholics of the day.\r\n\r\nIn 1675 he terminated his career. In the last year of his life his mind\r\nbecame so enfeebled as to be incapable of thinking, and he died in\r\nextreme poverty. It is true that his uncommon genius had been amply\r\nrewarded; but amongst his talents that of preserving the favours of\r\nfortune he had not acquired.\r\n\r\nFontenelle, his nephew, presents a minute and interesting description of\r\nthis great man. Vigneul Marville says, that when he saw Corneille he had\r\nthe appearance of a country tradesman, and he could not conceive how a\r\nman of so rustic an appearance could put into the mouths of his Romans\r\nsuch heroic sentiments. Corneille was sufficiently large and full in his\r\nperson; his air simple and vulgar; always negligent; and very little\r\nsolicitous of pleasing by his exterior. His face had something\r\nagreeable, his nose large, his mouth not unhandsome, his eyes full of\r\nfire, his physiognomy lively, with strong features, well adapted to be\r\ntransmitted to posterity on a medal or bust. His pronunciation was not\r\nvery distinct: and he read his verses with force, but without grace.\r\n\r\nHe was acquainted with polite literature, with history, and politics;\r\nbut he generally knew them best as they related to the stage. For other\r\nknowledge he had neither leisure, curiosity, nor much esteem. He spoke\r\nlittle, even on subjects which he perfectly understood. He did not\r\nembellish what he said, and to discover the great Corneille it became\r\nnecessary to read him.\r\n\r\nHe was of a melancholy disposition, had something blunt in his manner,\r\nand sometimes he appeared rude; but in fact he was no disagreeable\r\ncompanion, and made a good father and husband. He was tender, and his\r\nsoul was very susceptible of friendship. His constitution was very\r\nfavourable to love, but never to debauchery, and rarely to violent\r\nattachment. His soul was fierce and independent: it could never be\r\nmanaged, for it would never bend. This, indeed, rendered him very\r\ncapable of portraying Roman virtue, but incapable of improving his\r\nfortune. Nothing equalled his incapacity for business but his aversion:\r\nthe slightest troubles of this kind occasioned him alarm and terror. He\r\nwas never satiated with praise, although he was continually receiving\r\nit; but if he was sensible to fame, he was far removed from vanity.\r\n\r\nWhat Fontenelle observes of Corneille's love of fame is strongly proved\r\nby our great poet himself, in an epistle to a friend, in which we find\r\nthe following remarkable description of himself; an instance that what\r\nthe world calls vanity, at least interests in a great genius.\r\n\r\n    Nous nous aimons un peu, c'est notre foible à tous;\r\n    Le prix que nous valons que le sçait mieux que nous?\r\n    Et puis la mode en est, et la cour l'autorise,\r\n    Nous parlons de nous-mêmes avec toute franchise,\r\n    La fausse humilité ne met plus en credit.\r\n    Je sçais ce que je vaux, et crois ce qu'on m'en dit,\r\n    Pour me faire admirer je ne fais point de ligue;\r\n    J'ai peu de voix pour moi, mais je les ai sans brigue;\r\n    Et mon ambition, pour faire plus de bruit\r\n    Ne les va point quêter de réduit en réduit.\r\n    Mon travail sans appui monte sur le theâtre,\r\n    Chacun en liberté l'y blame ou idolâtre;\r\n    Là, sans que mes amis prêchent leurs sentimens,\r\n    J'arrache quelquefois leurs applaudissemens;\r\n    Là, content da succès que le mérite donne,\r\n    Par d'illustres avis je n'éblouis personne;\r\n    Je satisfais ensemble et peuple et courtisans;\r\n    Et mes vers en tous lieux sent mes seuls partisans;\r\n    Par leur seule beauté ma plume est estimée;\r\n    Je ne dois qu'à moi seul toute ma renommée;\r\n    Et pense toutefois n'avoir point de rival,\r\n    A qui je fasse tort, en le traitant d'égal.\r\n\r\nI give his sentiments in English verse.\r\n\r\n        Self-love prevails too much in every state;\r\n        Who, like ourselves, our secret worth can rate?\r\n        Since 'tis a fashion authorised at court,\r\n        Frankly our merits we ourselves report.\r\n        A proud humility will not deceive;\r\n        I know my worth; what others say, believe.\r\n        To be admired I form no petty league;\r\n        Few are my friends, but gain'd without intrigue.\r\n        My bold ambition, destitute of grace,\r\n        Scorns still to beg their votes from place to place.\r\n        On the fair stage my scenic toils I raise,\r\n        While each is free to censure or to praise;\r\n        And there, unaided by inferior arts,\r\n        I snatch the applause that rushes from their hearts.\r\n        Content by Merit still to win the crown,\r\n        With no illustrious names I cheat the town.\r\n        The galleries thunder, and the pit commends;\r\n        My verses, everywhere, my only friends!\r\n        'Tis from their charms alone my praise I claim;\r\n        'Tis to myself alone, I owe my fame;\r\n        And know no rival whom I fear to meet,\r\n        Or injure, when I grant an equal seat.\r\n\r\nVoltaire censures Corneille for making his heroes say continually they\r\nare great men. But in drawing the character of a hero he draws his own.\r\nAll his heroes are only so many Corneilles in different situations.\r\n\r\nThomas Corneille attempted the same career as his brother; perhaps his\r\nname was unfortunate, for it naturally excited a comparison which could\r\nnot be favourable to him. Gaçon, the Dennis of his day, wrote the\r\nfollowing smart impromptu under his portrait:--\r\n\r\n    Voyant le portrait de Corneille,\r\n    Gardez-vous de crier merveille;\r\n    Et dans vos transports n'allez pas\r\n    Prendre ici _Pierre_ pour _Thomas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all ages there has existed an anti-poetical party. This faction\r\nconsists of those frigid intellects incapable of that glowing expansion\r\nso necessary to feel the charms of an art, which only addresses itself\r\nto the imagination; or of writers who, having proved unsuccessful in\r\ntheir court to the muses, revenge themselves by reviling them; and also\r\nof those religious minds who consider the ardent effusions of poetry as\r\ndangerous to the morals and peace of society.\r\n\r\nPlato, amongst the ancients, is the model of those moderns who profess\r\nthemselves to be ANTI-POETICAL.\r\n\r\nThis writer, in his ideal republic, characterises a man who occupies\r\nhimself with composing verses as a very dangerous member of society,\r\nfrom the inflammatory tendency of his writings. It is by arguing from\r\nits abuse, that he decries this enchanting talent. At the same time it\r\nis to be recollected, that no head was more finely organised for the\r\nvisions of the muse than Plato's: he was a true poet, and had addicted\r\nhimself in his prime of life to the cultivation of the art, but\r\nperceiving that he could not surpass his inimitable original, Homer, he\r\nemployed this insidious manner of depreciating his works. In the Phædon\r\nhe describes the feelings of a genuine Poet. To become such, he says, it\r\nwill never be sufficient to be guided by the rules of art, unless we\r\nalso feel the ecstasies of that _furor_, almost divine, which in this\r\nkind of composition is the most palpable and least ambiguous character\r\nof a true inspiration. Cold minds, ever tranquil and ever in possession\r\nof themselves, are incapable of producing exalted poetry; their verses\r\nmust always be feeble, diffusive, and leave no impression; the verses of\r\nthose who are endowed with a strong and lively imagination, and who,\r\nlike Homer's personification of Discord, have their heads incessantly in\r\nthe skies, and their feet on the earth, will agitate you, burn in your\r\nheart, and drag you along with them; breaking like an impetuous torrent,\r\nand swelling your breast with that enthusiasm with which they are\r\nthemselves possessed.\r\n\r\nSuch is the character of a _poet_ in a _poetical age_!--The tuneful race\r\nhave many corporate bodies of mechanics; Pontypool manufacturers,\r\ninlayers, burnishers, gilders, and filers!\r\n\r\nMen of taste are sometimes disgusted in turning over the works of the\r\nanti-poetical, by meeting with gross railleries and false judgments\r\nconcerning poetry and poets. Locke has expressed a marked contempt of\r\npoets; but we see what ideas he formed of poetry by his warm panegyric\r\nof one of Blackmore's epics! and besides he was himself a most unhappy\r\npoet! Selden, a scholar of profound erudition, has given us _his_\r\nopinion concerning poets. \"It is ridiculous for a _lord_ to print\r\nverses; he may make them to please himself. If a man in a private\r\nchamber twirls his band-strings, or plays with a rush to please himself,\r\nit is well enough; but if he should go into Fleet-street, and sit upon a\r\nstall and twirl a band-string, or play with a rush, then all the boys in\r\nthe street would laugh at him.\"--As if \"the sublime and the beautiful\"\r\ncan endure a comparison with the twirling of a band-string or playing\r\nwith a rush!--A poet, related to an illustrious family, and who did not\r\nwrite unpoetically, entertained a far different notion concerning poets.\r\nSo persuaded was he that to be a true poet required an elevated mind,\r\nthat it was a maxim with him that no writer could be an excellent poet\r\nwho was not descended from a noble family. This opinion is as absurd as\r\nthat of Selden:--but when one party will not grant enough, the other\r\nalways assumes too much. The great Pascal, whose extraordinary genius\r\nwas discovered in the sciences, knew little of the nature of poetical\r\nbeauty. He said \"Poetry has no settled object.\" This was the decision of\r\na geometrician, not of a poet. \"Why should he speak of what he did not\r\nunderstand?\" asked the lively Voltaire. Poetry is not an object which\r\ncomes under the cognizance of philosophy or wit.\r\n\r\nLonguerue had profound erudition; but he decided on poetry in the same\r\nmanner as those learned men. Nothing so strongly characterises such\r\nliterary men as the following observations in the Longueruana, p. 170.\r\n\r\n\"There are two _books on Homer_, which I prefer to _Homer himself_. The\r\nfirst is _Antiquitates Homericæ_ of Feithius, where he has extracted\r\neverything relative to the usages and customs of the Greeks; the other\r\nis, _Homeri Gnomologia per Duportum_, printed at Cambridge. In these two\r\nbooks is found everything valuable in Homer, without being obliged to\r\nget through his _Contes à dormir debout_!\" Thus men of _science_ decide\r\non men of _taste_! There are who study Homer and Virgil as the blind\r\ntravel through a fine country, merely to get to the end of their\r\njourney. It was observed at the death of Longuerue that in his immense\r\nlibrary not a volume of poetry was to be found. He had formerly read\r\npoetry, for indeed he had read everything. Racine tells us, that when\r\nyoung he paid him a visit; the conversation turned on _poets_; our\r\n_erudit_ reviewed them all with the most ineffable contempt of the\r\npoetical talent, from which he said we learn nothing. He seemed a little\r\ncharitable towards Ariosto.--\"As for that _madman_,\" said he, \"he has\r\namused me sometimes.\" Dacier, a poetical pedant after all, was asked who\r\nwas the greater poet, Homer or Virgil? he honestly answered, \"Homer by a\r\nthousand years!\"\r\n\r\nBut it is mortifying to find among the _anti-poetical_ even _poets_\r\nthemselves! Malherbe, the first poet in France in his day, appears\r\nlittle to have esteemed the art. He used to say that \"a good poet was\r\nnot more useful to the state than a skilful player of nine-pins!\"\r\nMalherbe wrote with costive labour. When a poem was shown to him which\r\nhad been highly commended, he sarcastically asked if it would \"lower the\r\nprice of bread?\" In these instances he maliciously confounded the\r\n_useful_ with the _agreeable_ arts. Be it remembered, that Malherbe had\r\na cynical heart, cold and unfeeling; his character may be traced in his\r\npoetry; labour and correctness, without one ray of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nLe Clerc was a scholar not entirely unworthy to be ranked amongst the\r\nLockes, the Seldens, and the Longuerues; and his opinions are as just\r\nconcerning poets. In the Parhasiana he has written a treatise on poets\r\nin a very unpoetical manner. I shall notice his coarse railleries\r\nrelating to what he calls \"the personal defects of poets.\" In vol. i. p.\r\n33, he says, \"In the Scaligerana we have Joseph Scaliger's opinion\r\nconcerning poets. 'There never was a man who was a poet, or addicted to\r\nthe study of poetry, but his heart was puffed up with his\r\ngreatness.'--This is very true. The poetical enthusiasm persuades those\r\ngentlemen that they have something in them superior to others, because\r\nthey employ a language peculiar to themselves. When the poetic furor\r\nseizes them, its traces frequently remain on their faces, which make\r\nconnoisseurs say with Horace,\r\n\r\n    Aut insanit homo, ant versus facit.\r\n\r\n    There goes a madman or a bard!\r\n\r\n\"Their thoughtful air and melancholy gait make them appear insane; for,\r\naccustomed to versify while they walk, and to bite their nails in\r\napparent agonies, their steps are measured and slow, and they look as if\r\nthey were reflecting on something of consequence, although they are only\r\nthinking, as the phrase runs, of nothing!\" I have only transcribed the\r\nabove description of our jocular scholar, with an intention of\r\ndescribing those exterior marks of that fine enthusiasm, of which the\r\npoet is peculiarly susceptible, and which have exposed many an elevated\r\ngenius to the ridicule of the vulgar.\r\n\r\nI find this admirably defended by Charpentier: \"Men may ridicule as much\r\nas they please those gesticulations and contortions which poets are apt\r\nto make in the act of composing; it is certain, however, that they\r\ngreatly assist in putting the imagination into motion. These kinds of\r\nagitation do not always show a mind which labours with its sterility;\r\nthey frequently proceed from a mind which excites and animates itself.\r\nQuintilian has nobly compared them to those lashings of his tail which a\r\nlion gives himself when he is preparing to combat. Persius, when he\r\nwould give us an idea of a cold and languishing oration, says that its\r\nauthor did not strike his desk nor bite his nails.\"\r\n\r\n    Nec pluteum cædit, nec demorsos sapit ungues.\r\n\r\nThese exterior marks of enthusiasm may be illustrated by the following\r\ncurious anecdote:--Domenichino, the painter, was accustomed to act the\r\ncharacters of all the figures he would represent on his canvas, and to\r\nspeak aloud whatever the passion he meant to describe could prompt.\r\nPainting the martyrdom of St. Andrew, Carracci one day caught him in a\r\nviolent passion, speaking in a terrible and menacing tone. He was at\r\nthat moment employed on a soldier who was threatening the saint. When\r\nthis fit of enthusiastic abstraction had passed, Carracci ran and\r\nembraced him, acknowledging that Domenichino had been that day his\r\nmaster; and that he had learnt from him the true manner to succeed in\r\ncatching the expression--that great pride of the painter's art.\r\n\r\nThus different are the sentiments of the intelligent and the\r\nunintelligent on the same subject. A Carracci embraced a kindred genius\r\nfor what a Le Clerc or a Selden would have ridiculed.\r\n\r\nPoets, I confess, frequently indulge _reveries_, which, though they\r\noffer no charms to their friends, are too delicious to forego. In the\r\nideal world, peopled with all its fairy inhabitants, and ever open to\r\ntheir contemplation, they travel with an unwearied foot. Crebillon, the\r\ncelebrated tragic poet, was enamoured of solitude, that he might there\r\nindulge, without interruption, in those fine romances with which his\r\nimagination teemed. One day when he was in a deep reverie, a friend\r\nentered hastily: \"Don't disturb me,\" cried the poet; \"I am enjoying a\r\nmoment of happiness: I am going to hang a villain of a minister, and\r\nbanish another who is an idiot.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the anti-poetical may be placed the father of the great monarch\r\nof Prussia. George the Second was not more the avowed enemy of the\r\nmuses. Frederic would not suffer the prince to read verses; and when he\r\nwas desirous of study, or of the conversation of literary men, he was\r\nobliged to do it secretly. Every poet was odious to his majesty. One\r\nday, having observed some lines written on one of the doors of the\r\npalace, he asked a courtier their signification. They were explained to\r\nhim; they were Latin verses composed by Wachter, a man of letters, then\r\nresident at Berlin. The king immediately sent for the bard, who came\r\nwarm with the hope of receiving a reward for his ingenuity. He was\r\nastonished, however, to hear the king, in a violent passion, accost him,\r\n\"I order you immediately to quit this city and my kingdom.\" Wachter\r\ntook refuge in Hanover. As little indeed was this anti-poetical monarch\r\na friend to philosophers. Two or three such kings might perhaps renovate\r\nthe ancient barbarism of Europe. Barratier, the celebrated child, was\r\npresented to his majesty of Prussia as a prodigy of erudition; the king,\r\nto mortify our ingenious youth, coldly asked him, \"If he knew the law?\"\r\nThe learned boy was constrained to acknowledge that he knew nothing of\r\nthe law. \"Go,\" was the reply of this Augustus, \"go, and study it before\r\nyou give yourself out as a scholar.\" Poor Barratier renounced for this\r\npursuit his other studies, and persevered with such ardour that he\r\nbecame an excellent lawyer at the end of fifteen months; but his\r\nexertions cost him at the same time his life!\r\n\r\nEvery monarch, however, has not proved so destitute of poetic\r\nsensibility as this Prussian. Francis I. gave repeated marks of his\r\nattachment to the favourites of the muses, by composing several\r\noccasional sonnets, which are dedicated to their eulogy. Andrelin, a\r\nFrench poet, enjoyed the happy fate of Oppian, to whom the emperor\r\nCaracalla counted as many pieces of gold as there were verses in one of\r\nhis poems; and with great propriety they have been called \"golden\r\nverses.\" Andrelin, when he recited his poem on the Conquest of Naples\r\nbefore Charles VIII., received a sack of silver coin, which with\r\ndifficulty he carried home. Charles IX., says Brantome, loved verses,\r\nand recompensed poets, not indeed immediately, but gradually, that they\r\nmight always be stimulated to excel. He used to say, that poets\r\nresembled race-horses, that must be fed but not fattened, for then they\r\nwere good for nothing. Marot was so much esteemed by kings, that he was\r\ncalled the poet of princes, and the prince of poets.\r\n\r\nIn the early state of poetry what honours were paid to its votaries!\r\nRonsard, the French Chaucer, was the first who carried away the prize at\r\nthe Floral Games. This meed of poetic honour was an eglantine composed\r\nof silver. The reward did not appear equal to the merit of the work and\r\nthe reputation of the poet; and on this occasion the city of Toulouse\r\nhad a Minerva of solid silver struck, of considerable value. This image\r\nwas sent to Ronsard, accompanied by a decree, in which he was declared,\r\nby way of eminence, \"The French Poet.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a curious anecdote to add, that when, at a later period, a similar\r\nMinerva was adjudged to Maynard for his verses, the Capitouls, of\r\nToulouse, who were the executors of the Floral gifts, to their shame,\r\nout of covetousness, never obeyed the decision of the poetical judges.\r\nThis circumstance is noticed by Maynard in an epigram, which bears this\r\ntitle: _On a Minerva of silver, promised but not given_.\r\n\r\nThe anecdote of Margaret of Scotland, wife of the Dauphin of France, and\r\nAlain the poet, is generally known. Who is not charmed with that fine\r\nexpression of her poetical sensibility? The person of Alain was\r\nrepulsive, but his poetry had attracted her affections. Passing through\r\none of the halls of the palace, she saw him sleeping on a bench; she\r\napproached and kissed him. Some of her attendants could not conceal\r\ntheir astonishment that she should press with her lips those of a man so\r\nfrightfully ugly. The amiable princess answered, smiling, \"I did not\r\nkiss the man, but the mouth which has uttered so many fine things.\"\r\n\r\nThe great Colbert paid a pretty compliment to Boileau and Racine. This\r\nminister, at his villa, was enjoying the conversation of our two poets,\r\nwhen the arrival of a prelate was announced: turning quickly to the\r\nservant, he said, \"Let him be shown everything except myself!\"\r\n\r\nTo such attentions from this great minister, Boileau alludes in these\r\nverses:--\r\n\r\n    Plus d'un grand m'aima jusqnes à la tendresse;\r\n    Et ma vue à Colbert inspiroit l'allégresse.\r\n\r\nSeveral pious persons have considered it as highly meritable to abstain\r\nfrom the reading of poetry! A good father, in his account of the last\r\nhours of Madame Racine, the lady of the celebrated tragic poet, pays\r\nhigh compliments to her religious disposition, which, he says, was so\r\naustere, that she would not allow herself to read poetry, as she\r\nconsidered it to be a dangerous pleasure; and he highly commends her for\r\nnever having read the tragedies of her husband! Arnauld, though so\r\nintimately connected with Racine for many years, had not read his\r\ncompositions. When at length he was persuaded to read Phædra, he\r\ndeclared himself to be delighted, but complained that the poet had set a\r\ndangerous example, in making the manly Hippolytus dwindle to an\r\neffeminate lover. As a critic, Arnauld was right; but Racine had his\r\nnation to please. Such persons entertain notions of poetry similar to\r\nthat of an ancient father, who calls poetry the wine of Satan; or to\r\nthat of the religious and austere Nicole, who was so ably answered by\r\nRacine: he said, that dramatic poets were public poisoners, not of\r\nbodies, but of souls.\r\n\r\nPoets, it is acknowledged, have foibles peculiar to themselves. They\r\nsometimes act in the daily commerce of life as if every one was\r\nconcerned in the success of their productions. Poets are too frequently\r\nmerely poets. Segrais has recorded that the following maxim of\r\nRochefoucault was occasioned by reflecting on the characters of Boileau\r\nand Racine. \"It displays,\" he writes, \"a great poverty of mind to have\r\nonly one kind of genius.\" On this Segrais observes, and Segrais knew\r\nthem intimately, that their conversation only turned on poetry; take\r\nthem from that, and they knew nothing. It was thus with one Du Perrier,\r\na good poet, but very poor. When he was introduced to Pelisson, who\r\nwished to be serviceable to him, the minister said, \"In what can he be\r\nemployed? He is only occupied by his verses.\"\r\n\r\nAll these complaints are not unfounded; yet, perhaps, it is unjust to\r\nexpect from an excelling artist all the petty accomplishments of\r\nfrivolous persons, who have studied no art but that of practising on the\r\nweaknesses of their friends. The enthusiastic votary, who devotes his\r\ndays and nights to meditations on his favourite art, will rarely be\r\nfound that despicable thing, a mere man of the world. Du Bos has justly\r\nobserved, that men of genius, born for a particular profession, appear\r\ninferior to others when they apply themselves to other occupations. That\r\nabsence of mind which arises from their continued attention to their\r\nideas, renders them awkward in their manners. Such defects are even a\r\nproof of the activity of genius.\r\n\r\nIt is a common foible with poets to read their verses to friends.\r\nSegrais has ingeniously observed, to use his own words, \"When young I\r\nused to please myself in reciting my verses indifferently to all\r\npersons; but I perceived when Scarron, who was my intimate friend, used\r\nto take his portfolio and read his verses to me, although they were\r\ngood, I frequently became weary. I then reflected, that those to whom I\r\nread mine, and who, for the greater part, had no taste for poetry, must\r\nexperience the same disagreeable sensation. I resolved for the future to\r\nread my verses only to those who entreated me, and to read but a few at\r\na time. We flatter ourselves too much; we conclude that what please us\r\nmust please others. We will have persons indulgent to us, and frequently\r\nwe will have no indulgence for those who are in want of it.\" An\r\nexcellent hint for young poets, and for those old ones who carry odes\r\nand elegies in their pockets, to inflict the pains of the torture on\r\ntheir friends.\r\n\r\nThe affection which a poet feels for his verses has been frequently\r\nextravagant. Bayle, ridiculing that parental tenderness which writers\r\nevince for their poetical compositions, tells us, that many having\r\nwritten epitaphs on friends whom they believed on report to have died,\r\ncould not determine to keep them in their closet, but suffered them to\r\nappear in the lifetime of those very friends whose death they\r\ncelebrated. In another place he says, such is their infatuation for\r\ntheir productions, that they prefer giving to the public their\r\npanegyrics of persons whom afterwards they satirized, rather than\r\nsuppress the verses which contain those panegyrics. We have many\r\nexamples of this in the poems, and even in the epistolary correspondence\r\nof modern writers. It is customary with most authors, when they quarrel\r\nwith a person after the first edition of their work, to cancel his\r\neulogies in the next. But poets and letter-writers frequently do not do\r\nthis; because they are so charmed with the happy turn of their\r\nexpressions, and other elegancies of composition, that they perfer the\r\npraise which they may acquire for their style to the censure which may\r\nfollow from their inconsistency.\r\n\r\nAfter having given a hint to _young_ poets, I shall offer one to\r\n_veterans_. It is a common defect with them that they do not know when\r\nto quit the muses in their advanced age. Bayle says, \"Poets and orators\r\nshould be mindful to retire from their occupations, which so peculiarly\r\nrequire the fire of imagination; yet it is but too common to see them in\r\ntheir career, even in the decline of life. It seems as if they would\r\ncondemn the public to drink even the lees of their nectar.\" Afer and\r\nDaurat were both poets who had acquired considerable reputation, but\r\nwhich they overturned when they persisted to write in their old age\r\nwithout vigour and without fancy.\r\n\r\n    What crowds of these impenitently bold,\r\n    In sounds and jingling syllables grown old,\r\n    They run on poets, in a raging rein,\r\n    E'en to the dregs and squeezings of the brain:\r\n    Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense,\r\n    And rhyme with all the rage of impotence.\r\n\r\n                                      POPE.\r\n\r\nIt is probable he had Wycherley in his eye when he wrote this. The\r\nveteran bard latterly scribbled much indifferent verse; and Pope had\r\nfreely given his opinion, by which he lost his friendship!\r\n\r\nIt is still worse when aged poets devote their exhausted talents to\r\n_divine poems_, as did Waller; and Milton in his second epic. Such\r\npoems, observes Voltaire, are frequently entitled \"_sacred poems_;\" and\r\n_sacred_ they are, for no one touches them. From a soil so arid what can\r\nbe expected but insipid fruits? Corneille told Chevreau several years\r\nbefore his death, that he had taken leave of the theatre, for he had\r\nlost his poetical powers with his teeth.\r\n\r\nPoets have sometimes displayed an obliquity of taste in their female\r\nfavourites. As if conscious of the power of ennobling others, some have\r\nselected them from the lowest classes, whom, having elevated into\r\ndivinities, they have addressed in the language of poetical devotion.\r\nThe Chloe of Prior, after all his raptures, was a plump barmaid. Ronsard\r\naddressed many of his verses to Miss Cassandra, who followed the same\r\noccupation: in one of his sonnets to her, he fills it with a crowd of\r\npersonages taken from the Iliad, which to the honest girl must have all\r\nbeen extremely mysterious. Colletet, a French bard, married three of his\r\nservants. His last lady was called _la belle Claudine_. Ashamed of such\r\nmenial alliances, he attempted to persuade the world that he had married\r\nthe tenth muse; and for this purpose published verses in her name. When\r\nhe died, the vein of Claudine became suddenly dry. She indeed published\r\nher \"Adieux to the Muses;\" but it was soon discovered that all the\r\nverses of this lady, including her \"Adieux,\" were the compositions of\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nSometimes, indeed, the ostensible mistresses of poets have no existence;\r\nand a slight occasion is sufficient to give birth to one. Racan and\r\nMalherbe were one day conversing on their amours; that is, of selecting\r\na lady who should be the object of their verses. Racan named one, and\r\nMalherbe another. It happening that both had the same name, Catherine,\r\nthey passed the whole afternoon in forming it into an anagram. They\r\nfound three: Arthenice, Eracinthe, and Charinté. The first was\r\npreferred, and many a fine ode was written in praise of the beautiful\r\nArthenice!\r\n\r\nPoets change their opinions of their own productions wonderfully at\r\ndifferent periods of life. Baron Haller was in his youth warmly attached\r\nto poetic composition. His house was on fire, and to rescue his poems\r\nhe rushed through the flames. He was so fortunate as to escape with his\r\nbeloved manuscripts in his hand. Ten years afterwards he condemned to\r\nthe flames those very poems which he had ventured his life to preserve.\r\n\r\nSatirists, if they escape the scourges of the law, have reason to dread\r\nthe cane of the satirised. Of this kind we have many anecdotes on\r\nrecord; but none more poignant than the following:--Benserade was caned\r\nfor lampooning the Duc d'Epernon. Some days afterwards he appeared at\r\ncourt, but being still lame from the rough treatment he had received, he\r\nwas forced to support himself by a cane. A wit, who knew what had\r\npassed, whispered the affair to the queen. She, dissembling, asked him\r\nif he had the gout? \"Yes, madam,\" replied our lame satirist, \"and\r\ntherefore I make use of a cane.\" \"Not so,\" interrupted the malignant\r\nBautru, \"Benserade in this imitates those holy martyrs who are always\r\nrepresented with the instrument which occasioned their sufferings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROMANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance has been elegantly defined as the offspring of FICTION and LOVE.\r\nMen of learning have amused themselves with tracing the epocha of\r\nromances; but the erudition is desperate which would fix on the inventor\r\nof the first romance: for what originates in nature, who shall hope to\r\ndetect the shadowy outlines of its beginnings? The Theagenes and\r\nChariclea of Heliodorus appeared in the fourth century; and this elegant\r\nprelate was the Grecian Fenelon. It has been prettily said, that\r\nposterior romances seem to be the children of the marriage of Theagenes\r\nand Chariclea. The Romance of \"The Golden Ass,\" by Apuleius, which\r\ncontains the beautiful tale of \"Cupid and Psyche,\" remains unrivalled;\r\nwhile the \"Däphne and Chloe\" of Longus, in the old version of Amyot, is\r\ninexpressibly delicate, simple, and inartificial, but sometimes offends\r\nus, for nature there \"plays her virgin fancies.\"\r\n\r\nBeautiful as these compositions are, when the imagination of the writer\r\nis sufficiently stored with accurate observations on human nature, in\r\ntheir birth, like many of the fine arts, the zealots of an ascetic\r\nreligion opposed their progress. However Heliodorus may have delighted\r\nthose who were not insensible to the felicities of a fine imagination,\r\nand to the enchanting elegancies of style, he raised himself, among his\r\nbrother ecclesiastics, enemies, who at length so far prevailed, that, in\r\na synod, it was declared that his performance was dangerous to young\r\npersons, and that if the author did not suppress it, he must resign his\r\nbishopric. We are told he preferred his romance to his bishopric. Even\r\nso late as in Racine's time it was held a crime to peruse these\r\nunhallowed pages. He informs us that the first effusions of his muse\r\nwere in consequence of studying that ancient romance, which, his tutor\r\nobserving him to devour with the keenness of a famished man, snatched\r\nfrom his hands and flung it in the fire. A second copy experienced the\r\nsame fate. What could Racine do? He bought a third, and took the\r\nprecaution of devouring it secretly till he got it by heart: after which\r\nhe offered it to the pedagogue with a smile, to burn like the others.\r\n\r\nThe decision of these ascetic bigots was founded in their opinion of the\r\nimmorality of such works. They alleged that the writers paint too warmly\r\nto the imagination, address themselves too forcibly to the passions, and\r\nin general, by the freedom of their representations, hover on the\r\nborders of indecency. Let it be sufficient, however, to observe, that\r\nthose who condemned the liberties which these writers take with the\r\nimagination could indulge themselves with the Anacreontic voluptuousness\r\nof the wise _Solomon_, when sanctioned by the authority of the church.\r\n\r\nThe marvellous power of romance over the human mind is exemplified in\r\nthis curious anecdote of oriental literature.\r\n\r\nMahomet found they had such an influence over the imaginations of his\r\nfollowers, that he has expressly forbidden them in his Koran; and the\r\nreason is given in the following anecdote:--An Arabian merchant having\r\nlong resided in Persia, returned to his own country while the prophet\r\nwas publishing his Koran. The merchant, among his other riches, had a\r\ntreasure of romances concerning the Persian heroes. These he related to\r\nhis delighted countrymen, who considered them to be so excellent, that\r\nthe legends of the Koran were neglected, and they plainly told the\r\nprophet that the \"Persian Tales\" were superior to his. Alarmed, he\r\nimmediately had a visitation from the angel Gabriel, declaring them\r\nimpious and pernicious, hateful to God and Mahomet. This checked their\r\ncurrency; and all true believers yielded up the exquisite delight of\r\npoetic fictions for the insipidity of religious ones. Yet these romances\r\nmay be said to have outlived the Koran itself; for they have spread into\r\nregions which the Koran could never penetrate. Even to this day Colonel\r\nCapper, in his travels across the Desert, saw \"Arabians sitting round a\r\nfire, listening to their tales with such attention and pleasure, as\r\ntotally to forget the fatigue and hardship with which an instant before\r\nthey were entirely overcome.\" And Wood, in his journey to Palmyra:--\"At\r\nnight the Arabs sat in a circle drinking coffee, while one of the\r\ncompany diverted the rest by relating a piece of history on the subject\r\nof love or war, or with an extempore tale.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ellis has given us \"Specimens of the Early English Metrical\r\nRomances,\" and Ritson and Weber have printed two collections of them\r\nentire, valued by the poetical antiquary. Learned inquirers have traced\r\nthe origin of romantic fiction to various sources.[117] From Scandinavia\r\nissued forth the giants, dragons, witches, and enchanters. The curious\r\nreader will be gratified by \"Illustrations of Northern Antiquities,\" a\r\nvolume in quarto; where he will find extracts from \"The Book of Heroes\"\r\nand \"The Nibelungen Lay,\"[118] with many other metrical tales from the\r\nold German, Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic languages. In the East,\r\nArabian fancy bent her iris of many softened hues over a delightful land\r\nof fiction: while the Welsh, in their emigration to Britanny, are\r\nbelieved to have brought with them their national fables. That\r\nsubsequent race of minstrels, known by the name of _Troubadours_ in the\r\nSouth of France, composed their erotic or sentimental poems; and those\r\nromancers called _Troveurs_, or finders, in the North of France, culled\r\nand compiled their domestic tales or _Fabliaux_, _Dits_, _Conte_, or\r\n_Lai_. Millot, Sainte Palaye, and Le Grand, have preserved, in their\r\n\"Histories of the Troubadours,\" their literary compositions. They were a\r\nromantic race of ambulatory poets, military and religious subjects their\r\nfavourite themes, yet bold and satirical on princes, and even on\r\npriests; severe moralisers, though libertines in their verse; so refined\r\nand chaste in their manners, that few husbands were alarmed at the\r\nenthusiastic language they addressed to their wives. The most romantic\r\nincidents are told of their loves. But love and its grosser passion were\r\nclearly distinguished from each other in their singular intercourse with\r\ntheir \"Dames.\" The object of their mind was separated from the object of\r\ntheir senses; the virtuous lady to whom they vowed their hearts was in\r\ntheir language styled \"_la dame de ses pensées_,\" a very distinct being\r\nfrom their other mistress! Such was the Platonic chimera that charmed in\r\nthe age of chivalry; the Laura of Petrarch might have been no other than\r\n\"the lady of his thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nFrom such productions in their improved state poets of all nations have\r\ndrawn their richest inventions. The agreeable wildness of that fancy\r\nwhich characterised the Eastern nations was often caught by the\r\ncrusaders. When they returned home, they mingled in their own the\r\ncustoms of each country. The Saracens, being of another religion, brave,\r\ndesperate, and fighting for their fatherland, were enlarged to their\r\nfears, under the tremendous form of _Paynim Giants_, while the reader of\r\nthat day followed with trembling sympathy the _Redcross Knight_. Thus\r\nfiction embellished religion, and religion invigorated fiction; and such\r\nincidents have enlivened the cantos of Ariosto, and adorned the epic of\r\nTasso. Spenser is the child of their creation; and it is certain that we\r\nare indebted to them for some of the bold and strong touches of Milton.\r\nOur great poet marks his affection for \"these lofty Fables and Romances,\r\namong which his young feet wandered.\" Collins was bewildered among their\r\nmagical seductions; and Dr. Johnson was enthusiastically delighted by\r\nthe old Spanish folio romance of \"Felixmarte of Hircania,\" and similar\r\nworks. The most ancient romances were originally composed in verse\r\nbefore they were converted into prose: no wonder that the lacerated\r\nmembers of the poet have been cherished by the sympathy of poetical\r\nsouls. Don Quixote's was a very agreeable insanity.\r\n\r\nThe most voluminous of these ancient romances is \"Le Roman de\r\nPerceforest.\" I have seen an edition in six small folio volumes, and its\r\nauthor has been called the French Homer by the writers of his age. In\r\nthe class of romances of chivalry, we have several translations in the\r\nblack letter. These books are very rare, and their price is as\r\nvoluminous. It is extraordinary that these writers were so unconscious\r\nof their future fame, that not one of their names has travelled down to\r\nus. There were eager readers in their days, but not a solitary\r\nbibliographer! All these romances now require some indulgence for their\r\nprolixity, and their Platonic amours; but they have not been surpassed\r\nin the wildness of their inventions, the ingenuity of their incidents,\r\nthe simplicity of their style, and their curious manners. Many a Homer\r\nlies hid among them; but a celebrated Italian critic suggested to me\r\nthat many of the fables of Homer are only disguised and degraded in the\r\nromances of chivalry. Those who vilify them as only barbarous imitations\r\nof classical fancy condemn them as some do Gothic architecture, as mere\r\ncorruptions of a purer style: such critics form their decision by\r\npreconceived notions; they are but indifferent philosophers, and to us\r\nseem to be deficient in imagination.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen I select two romantic adventures:--\r\n\r\nThe title of the extensive romance of Perceforest is, \"The most elegant,\r\ndelicious, mellifluous, and delightful history of Perceforest, King of\r\nGreat Britain, &c.\" The most ancient edition is that of 1528. The\r\nwriters of these Gothic fables, lest they should be considered as mere\r\ntriflers, pretended to an allegorical meaning concealed under the\r\ntexture of their fable. From the following adventure we learn the power\r\nof beauty in making _ten days_ appear as _yesterday_! Alexander the\r\nGreat in search of Perceforest, parts with his knights in an enchanted\r\nwood, and each vows they will not remain longer than one night in one\r\nplace. Alexander, accompanied by a page, arrives at Sebilla's castle,\r\nwho is a sorceress. He is taken by her witcheries and beauty, and the\r\npage, by the lady's maid, falls into the same mistake as his master, who\r\nthinks he is there only one night. They enter the castle with deep\r\nwounds, and issue perfectly recovered. I transcribe the latter part as a\r\nspecimen of the manner. When they were once out of the castle, the king\r\nsaid, \"Truly, Floridas, I know not how it has been with me; but\r\ncertainly Sebilla is a very honourable lady, and very beautiful, and\r\nvery charming in conversation. Sire (said Floridas), it is true; but one\r\nthing surprises me:--how is it that our wounds have healed in one night?\r\nI thought at least ten or fifteen days were necessary. Truly, said the\r\nking, that is astonishing! Now king Alexander met Gadiffer, king of\r\nScotland, and the valiant knight Le Tors. Well, said the king, have ye\r\nnews of the king of England? Ten days we have hunted him, and cannot\r\nfind him out. How, said Alexander, did we not separate _yesterday_ from\r\neach other? In God's name, said Gadiffer, what means your majesty? It is\r\n_ten days_! Have a care what you say, cried the king. Sire, replied\r\nGadiffer, it is so; ask Le Tors. On my honour, said Le Tors, the king of\r\nScotland speaks truth. Then, said the king, some of us are enchanted;\r\nFloridas, didst thou not think we separated _yesterday_? Truly, truly,\r\nyour majesty, I thought so! But when I saw our wounds healed in one\r\nnight, I had some suspicion that WE were _enchanted_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the old romance of Melusina, this lovely fairy (though to the world\r\nunknown as such), enamoured of Count Raymond, marries him, but first\r\nextorts a solemn promise that he will never disturb her on Saturdays. On\r\nthose days the inferior parts of her body are metamorphosed to that of a\r\nmermaid, as a punishment for a former error. Agitated by the malicious\r\ninsinuations of a friend, his curiosity and his jealousy one day conduct\r\nhim to the spot she retired to at those times. It was a darkened passage\r\nin the dungeon of the fortress. His hand gropes its way till it feels an\r\niron gate oppose it; nor can he discover a single chink, but at length\r\nperceives by his touch a loose nail; he places his sword in its head and\r\nscrews it out. Through this cranny he sees Melusina in the horrid form\r\nshe is compelled to assume. That tender mistress, transformed into a\r\nmonster bathing in a fount, flashing the spray of the water from a scaly\r\ntail! He repents of his fatal curiosity: she reproaches him, and their\r\nmutual happiness is for ever lost. The moral design of the tale\r\nevidently warns the lover to revere a _Woman's Secret_!\r\n\r\nSuch are the works which were the favourite amusements of our English\r\ncourt, and which doubtless had a due effect in refining the manners of\r\nthe age, in diffusing that splendid military genius, and that tender\r\ndevotion to the fair sex, which dazzle us in the reign of Edward III.,\r\nand through that enchanting labyrinth of History constructed by the\r\ngallant Froissart. In one of the revenue rolls of Henry III. there is an\r\nentry of \"Silver clasps and studs for his majesty's _great book of\r\nRomances_.\" Dr. Moore observes that the enthusiastic admiration of\r\nchivalry which Edward III. manifested during the whole course of his\r\nreign, was probably, in some measure, owing to his having studied the\r\n_clasped book_ in his great grandfather's library.\r\n\r\nThe Italian romances of the fourteenth century were spread abroad in\r\ngreat numbers. They formed the polite literature of the day. But if it\r\nis not permitted to authors freely to express their ideas, and give full\r\nplay to the imagination, these works must never be placed in the study\r\nof the rigid moralist. They, indeed, pushed their indelicacy to the\r\nverge of grossness, and seemed rather to seek than to avoid scenes,\r\nwhich a modern would blush to describe. They, to employ the expression\r\nof one of their authors, were not ashamed to name what God had created.\r\nCinthio, Bandello, and others, but chiefly Boccaccio, rendered\r\nlibertinism agreeable by the fascinating charms of a polished style and\r\na luxuriant imagination.\r\n\r\nThis, however, must not be admitted as an apology for immoral works; for\r\npoison is not the less poison, even when delicious. Such works were, and\r\nstill continue to be, the favourites of a nation stigmatized for being\r\nprone to impure amours. They are still curious in their editions, and\r\nare not parsimonious in their price for what they call an uncastrated\r\ncopy. There are many Italians, not literary men, who are in possession\r\nof an ample library of these old novelists.\r\n\r\nIf we pass over the moral irregularities of these romances, we may\r\ndiscover a rich vein of invention, which only requires to be released\r\nfrom that rubbish which disfigures it, to become of an invaluable price.\r\nThe _Decamerones_, the _Hecatommiti_, and the _Novellas_ of these\r\nwriters, translated into English, made no inconsiderable figure in the\r\nlittle library of our Shakspeare.[119] Chaucer had been a notorious\r\nimitator and lover of them. His \"Knight's Tale\" is little more than a\r\nparaphrase of \"Boccaccio's Teseoide.\" Fontaine has caught all their\r\ncharms with all their licentiousness. From such works these great poets,\r\nand many of their contemporaries, frequently borrowed their plots; not\r\nuncommonly kindled at their flame the ardour of their genius; but\r\nbending too submissively to the taste of their age, in extracting the\r\nore they have not purified it of the alloy. The origin of these tales\r\nmust be traced to the inventions of the Troveurs, who doubtless often\r\nadopted them from various nations. Of these tales, Le Grand has printed\r\na curious collection; and of the writers Mr. Ellis observes, in his\r\npreface to \"Way's Fabliaux,\" that the authors of the \"Cento Novelle\r\nAntiche,\" Boccaccio, Bandello, Chaucer, Gower,--in short, the writers of\r\nall Europe have probably made use of the inventions of the elder\r\nfablers. They have borrowed their general outlines, which they have\r\nfilled up with colours of their own, and have exercised their ingenuity\r\nin varying the drapery, in combining the groups, and in forming them\r\ninto more regular and animated pictures.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the French romances of the last century, called heroic,\r\nfrom the circumstance of their authors adopting the name of some hero.\r\nThe manners are the modern antique; and the characters are a sort of\r\nbeings made out of the old epical, the Arcadian pastoral, and the\r\nParisian sentimentality and affectation of the days of Voiture.[120] The\r\nAstrea of D'Urfé greatly contributed to their perfection. As this work\r\nis founded on several curious circumstances, it shall be the subject of\r\nthe following article; for it may be considered as a literary curiosity.\r\nThe Astrea was followed by the illustrious Bassa, Artamene, or the Great\r\nCyrus, Clelia, &c., which, though not adapted to the present age, once\r\ngave celebrity to their authors; and the Great Cyrus, in ten volumes,\r\npassed through five or six editions. Their style, as well as that of the\r\nAstrea, is diffuse and languid; yet Zaïde, and the Princess of Cleves,\r\nare masterpieces of the kind. Such works formed the first studies of\r\nRousseau, who, with his father, would sit up all night, till warned by\r\nthe chirping of the swallows how foolishly they had spent it! Some\r\nincidents in his Nouvelle Heloise have been retraced to these sources;\r\nand they certainly entered greatly into the formation of his character.\r\n\r\nSuch romances at length were regarded as pernicious to good sense,\r\ntaste, and literature. It was in this light they were considered by\r\nBoileau, after he had indulged in them in his youth.\r\n\r\nA celebrated Jesuit pronounced an oration against these works. The\r\nrhetorician exaggerates and hurls his thunders on flowers. He entreats\r\nthe magistrates not to suffer foreign romances to be scattered amongst\r\nthe people, but to lay on them heavy penalties, as on prohibited goods;\r\nand represents this prevailing taste as being more pestilential than the\r\nplague itself. He has drawn a striking picture of a family devoted to\r\nromance-reading; he there describes women occupied day and night with\r\ntheir perusal; children just escaped from the lap of their nurse\r\ngrasping in their little hands the fairy tales; and a country squire\r\nseated in an old arm-chair, reading to his family the most wonderful\r\npassages of the ancient works of chivalry.\r\n\r\nThese romances went out of fashion with our square-cocked hats: they had\r\nexhausted the patience of the public, and from them sprung NOVELS. They\r\nattempted to allure attention by this inviting title, and reducing their\r\nworks from ten to two volumes. The name of romance, including imaginary\r\nheroes and extravagant passions, disgusted; and they substituted scenes\r\nof domestic life, and touched our common feelings by pictures of real\r\nnature. Heroes were not now taken from the throne: they were sometimes\r\neven sought after amongst the lowest ranks of the people. Scarron seems\r\nto allude sarcastically to this degradation of the heroes of Fiction:\r\nfor in hinting at a new comic history he had projected, he tells us that\r\nhe gave it up suddenly because he had \"heard that his hero had just been\r\nhanged at Mans.\"\r\n\r\nNOVELS, as they were long _manufactured_, form a library of illiterate\r\nauthors for illiterate readers; but as they are _created_ by genius, are\r\nprecious to the philosopher. They paint the character of an individual\r\nor the manners of the age more perfectly than any other species of\r\ncomposition: it is in novels we observe as it were passing under our\r\neyes the refined frivolity of the French; the gloomy and disordered\r\nsensibility of the German; and the petty intrigues of the modern Italian\r\nin some Venetian Novels. We have shown the world that we possess writers\r\nof the first order in this delightful province of Fiction and of Truth;\r\nfor every Fiction invented naturally, must be true. After the abundant\r\ninvective poured on this class of books, it is time to settle for ever\r\nthe controversy, by asserting that these works of fiction are among the\r\nmost instructive of every polished nation, and must contain all the\r\nuseful truths of human life, if composed with genius. They are pictures\r\nof the passions, useful to our youth to contemplate. That acute\r\nphilosopher, Adam Smith, has given an opinion most favourable to\r\nNOVELS. \"The poets and romance writers who best paint the refinements\r\nand delicacies of love and friendship, and of all other private and\r\ndomestic affections, Racine and Voltaire, Richardson Marivaux, and\r\nRiccoboni, are in this case much better instructors than Zeno,\r\nChrysippus, or Epictetus.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of romances has been recently given by Mr. Dunlop, with many\r\npleasing details; but this work should be accompanied by the learned\r\nLenglet du Fresnoy's \"Bibliothèque des Romans,\" published under the name\r\nof M. le C. Gordon de Percel; which will be found useful for immediate\r\nreference for titles, dates, and a copious catalogue of romances and\r\nnovels to the year 1734.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Since the above was written, many other volumes have been\r\npublished illustrative of this branch of literature. The Bannatyne and\r\nMaitland Club and the Camden and Percy Societies have printed Metrical\r\nRomances entire.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: This famed lay has been magnificently published in\r\nGermany, where it is now considered as the native epic of the ancient\r\nkingdom.

Don Quixote,\r\nwhen dying, made up his mind, if he recovered, to turn shepherd, in\r\nimitation of some of the romance-heroes, who thus finished their career.\r\nThis old \"anti-romance\" works out this notion by a mad reader of\r\npastorals, who assumes the shepherd habit and tends a few wretched sheep\r\nat St. Cloud.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASTREA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI bring the Astrea forward to point out the ingenious manner by which a\r\nfine imagination can veil the common incidents of life, and turn\r\nwhatever it touches into gold.\r\n\r\nHonoré D'Urfé was the descendant of an illustrious family. His brother\r\nAnne married Diana of Chateaumorand, the wealthy heiress of another\r\ngreat house. After a marriage of no less duration than twenty-two years,\r\nthis union was broken by the desire of Anne himself, for a cause which\r\nthe delicacy of Diana had never revealed. Anne then became an\r\necclesiastic. Some time afterwards, Honoré, desirous of retaining the\r\ngreat wealth of Diana in the family, addressed this lady, and married\r\nher. This union, however, did not prove fortunate. Diana, like the\r\ngoddess of that name, was a huntress, continually surrounded by her\r\ndogs:--they dined with her at table, and slept with her in bed. This\r\ninsupportable nuisance could not be patiently endured by the elegant\r\nHonoré. He was also disgusted with the barrenness of the huntress Diana,\r\nwho was only delivered every year of abortions. He separated from her,\r\nand retired to Piedmont, where he passed his remaining days in peace,\r\nwithout feeling the thorns of marriage and ambition rankling in his\r\nheart. In this retreat he composed his Astrea; a pastoral romance, which\r\nwas the admiration of Europe during half a century. It forms a striking\r\npicture of human life, for the incidents are facts beautifully\r\nconcealed. They relate the amours and gallantries of the court of Henry\r\nthe Fourth. The personages in the Astrea display a rich invention; and\r\nthe work might be still read, were it not for those wire-drawn\r\nconversations, or rather disputations, which were then introduced into\r\nromances. In a modern edition, the Abbé Souchai has _curtailed_ these\r\ntiresome dialogues; the work still consists of ten duodecimos.\r\n\r\nIn this romance, Celidée, to cure the unfortunate Celadon, and to\r\ndeprive Thamire at the same time of every reason for jealousy, tears her\r\nface with a pointed diamond, and disfigures it in so cruel a manner,\r\nthat she excites horror in the breast of Thamire; but he so ardently\r\nadmires this exertion of virtue, that he loves her, hideous as she is\r\nrepresented, still more than when she was most beautiful. Heaven, to be\r\njust to these two lovers, restores the beauty of Celidée; which is\r\neffected by a sympathetic powder. This romantic incident is thus\r\nexplained:--One of the French princes (Thamire), when he returned from\r\nItaly, treated with coldness his amiable princess (Celidée); this was\r\nthe effect of his violent passion, which had become jealousy. The\r\ncoolness subsisted till the prince was imprisoned, for state affairs, in\r\nthe wood of Vincennes. The princess, with the permission of the court,\r\nfollowed him into his confinement. This proof of her love soon brought\r\nback the wandering heart and affections of the prince. The small-pox\r\nseized her; which is the pointed diamond, and the dreadful disfigurement\r\nof her face. She was so fortunate as to escape being marked by this\r\ndisease; which is meant by the sympathetic powder. This trivial incident\r\nis happily turned into the marvellous: that a wife should choose to be\r\nimprisoned with her husband is not singular; to escape being marked by\r\nthe small-pox happens every day; but to romance, as he has done, on such\r\ncommon circumstances, is beautiful and ingenious.\r\n\r\nD'Urfé, when a boy, is said to have been enamoured of Diana; this indeed\r\nhas been questioned. D'Urfé, however, was sent to the island of Malta to\r\nenter into that order of knighthood; and in his absence Diana was\r\nmarried to Anne. What an affliction for Honoré on his return to see her\r\nmarried, and to his brother! His affection did not diminish, but he\r\nconcealed it in respectful silence. He had some knowledge of his\r\nbrother's unhappiness, and on this probably founded his hopes. After\r\nseveral years, during which the modest Diana had uttered no complaint,\r\nAnne declared himself; and shortly afterwards Honoré, as we have\r\nnoticed, married Diana.\r\n\r\nOur author has described the parties under this false appearance of\r\nmarriage. He assumes the names of Celadon and Sylvander, and gives Diana\r\nthose of Astrea and Diana. He is Sylvander and she Astrea while she is\r\nmarried to Anne; and he Celadon and she Diana when the marriage is\r\ndissolved. Sylvander is represented always as a lover who sighs\r\nsecretly; nor does Diana declare her passion till overcome by the long\r\nsufferings of her faithful shepherd. For this reason Astrea and Diana,\r\nas well as Sylvander and Celadon, go together, prompted by the same\r\ndespair, to the FOUNTAIN of the TRUTH OF LOVE.\r\n\r\nSylvander is called an unknown shepherd, who has no other wealth than\r\nhis flock; because our author was the youngest of his family, or rather\r\na knight of Malta who possessed nothing but honour.\r\n\r\nCeladon in despair throws himself into a river; this refers to his\r\nvoyage to Malta. Under the name of Alexis he displays the friendship of\r\nAstrea for him, and all those innocent freedoms which passed between\r\nthem as relatives; from this circumstance he has contrived a difficulty\r\ninimitably delicate.\r\n\r\nSomething of passion is to be discovered in these expressions of\r\nfriendship. When Alexis assumes the name of Celadon, he calls that love\r\nwhich Astrea had mistaken for fraternal affection. This was the trying\r\nmoment. For though she loved him, she is rigorous in her duty and\r\nhonour. She says, \"what will they think of me if I unite myself to him,\r\nafter permitting, for so many years, those familiarities which a brother\r\nmay have taken with a sister, with me, who knew that in fact I remained\r\nunmarried?\"\r\n\r\nHow she got over this nice scruple does not appear; it was, however, for\r\na long time a great obstacle to the felicity of our author. There is an\r\nincident which shows the purity of this married virgin, who was fearful\r\nthe liberties she allowed Celadon might be ill construed. Phillis tells\r\nthe druid Adamas that Astrea was seen sleeping by the fountain of the\r\nTruth of Love, and that the unicorns which guarded those waters were\r\nobserved to approach her, and lay their heads on her lap. According to\r\nfable, it is one of the properties of these animals never to approach\r\nany female but a maiden: at this strange difficulty our druid remains\r\nsurprised; while Astrea has thus given an incontrovertible proof of her\r\npurity.\r\n\r\nThe history of Philander is that of the elder D'Urfé. None but boys\r\ndisguised as girls, and girls as boys, appear in the history. In this\r\nmanner he concealed, without offending modesty, the defect of his\r\nbrother. To mark the truth of this history, when Philander is disguised\r\nas a woman, while he converses with Astrea of his love, he frequently\r\nalludes to his misfortune, although in another sense.\r\n\r\nPhilander, ready to expire, will die with the glorious name of the\r\nhusband of Astrea. He entreats her to grant him this favour; she accords\r\nit to him, and swears before the gods that she receives him in her heart\r\nfor her husband. The truth is, he enjoyed nothing but the name.\r\nPhilander dies too, in combating with a hideous Moor, which is the\r\npersonification of his conscience, and which at length compelled him to\r\nquit so beautiful an object, and one so worthy of being eternally\r\nbeloved.\r\n\r\nThe gratitude of Sylvander, on the point of being sacrificed, represents\r\nthe consent of Honoré's parents to dissolve his vow of celibacy, and\r\nunite him to Diana; and the druid Adamas represents ecclesiastical\r\npower. The FOUNTAIN of the TRUTH OF LOVE is that of marriage; the\r\nunicorns are the symbols of that purity which should ever guard it; and\r\nthe flaming eyes of the lions, which are also there, represent those\r\ninconveniences attending marriage, but over which a faithful passion\r\neasily triumphs.\r\n\r\nIn this manner has our author disguised his own private history; and\r\nblended in his works a number of little amours which passed at the court\r\nof Henry the Great. These particulars were confided to Patru, on\r\nvisiting the author in his retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETS LAUREAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present article is a sketch of the history of POETS LAUREAT, from a\r\nmemoir of the French Academy, by the Abbé Resnel.\r\n\r\nThe custom of crowning poets is as ancient as poetry itself; it has,\r\nindeed, frequently varied; it existed, however, as late as the reign of\r\nTheodosius, when it was abolished as a remain of paganism.\r\n\r\nWhen the barbarians overspread Europe, few appeared to merit this\r\nhonour, and fewer who could have read their works. It was about the time\r\nof PETRARCH that POETRY resumed its ancient lustre; he was publicly\r\nhonoured with the LAUREL CROWN. It was in this century (the thirteenth)\r\nthat the establishment of Bachelor and Doctor was fixed in the\r\nuniversities. Those who were found worthy of the honour, obtained the\r\n_laurel of Bachelor_, or the _laurel of Doctor_; _Laurea\r\nBaccalaureatus_; _Laurea Doctoratus_. At their reception they not only\r\nassumed this _title_ but they also had a _crown of laurel_ placed on\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nTo this ceremony the ingenious writer attributes the revival of the\r\ncustom. The _poets_ were not slow in putting in their claims to what\r\nthey had most a right; and their patrons sought to encourage them by\r\nthese honourable distinctions.\r\n\r\nThe following _formula_ is the exact style of those which are yet\r\nemployed in the universities to confer the degree of Bachelor and\r\nDoctor, and serves to confirm the conjecture of Resnel:--\r\n\r\n\"We, count and senator,\" (Count d'Anguillara, who bestowed the laurel on\r\nPetrarch,) \"for us and our College, declare FRANCIS PETRARCH great poet\r\nand historian, and for a special mark of his quality of poet we have\r\nplaced with our hands on his head a _crown of laurel_, granting to him,\r\nby the tenor of these presents, and by the authority of King Robert, of\r\nthe senate and the people of Rome, in the poetic, as well as in the\r\nhistoric art, and generally in whatever relates to the said arts, as\r\nwell in this holy city as elsewhere, the free and entire power of\r\nreading, disputing, and interpreting all ancient books, to make new\r\nones, and compose poems, which, God assisting, shall endure from age to\r\nage.\"\r\n\r\nIn Italy, these honours did not long flourish; although Tasso dignified\r\nthe laurel crown by his acceptance of it. Many got crowned who were\r\nunworthy of the distinction. The laurel was even bestowed on QUERNO,\r\nwhose character is given in the Dunciad:--\r\n\r\n    Not with more glee, by hands pontific crown'd,\r\n    With scarlet hats wide-waving circled round,\r\n    Rome in her capitol saw _Querno_ sit,\r\n    Thron'd on seven hills, the Antichrist of wit.\r\n\r\n                                      CANTO II.\r\n\r\nThis man was made laureat, for the joke's sake; his poetry was inspired\r\nby his cups, a kind of poet who came in with the dessert; and he recited\r\ntwenty thousand verses. He was rather the _arch-buffoon_ than the\r\n_arch-poet_ of Leo. X. though honoured with the latter title. They\r\ninvented for him a new kind of laureated honour, and in the intermixture\r\nof the foliage raised to Apollo, slily inserted the vine and the cabbage\r\nleaves, which he evidently deserved, from his extreme dexterity in\r\nclearing the pontiff's dishes and emptying his goblets.\r\n\r\nUrban VIII. had a juster and more elevated idea of the children of\r\nFancy. It appears that he possessed much poetic sensibility. Of him it\r\nis recorded, that he wrote a letter to Chiabrera to felicitate him on\r\nthe success of his poetry: letters written by a pope were then an honour\r\nonly paid to crowned heads. One is pleased also with another testimony\r\nof his elegant dispositions. Charmed with a poem which Bracciolini\r\npresented to him, he gave him the surname of DELLE-APE, of the bees,\r\nwhich were the arms of this amiable pope. He, however, never crowned\r\nthese favourite bards with the laurel, which, probably, he deemed\r\nunworthy of them.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the laureat honours flourished under the reign of Maximilian\r\nthe First. He founded, in 1504, a Poetical College at Vienna; reserving\r\nto himself and the regent the power of bestowing the laurel. But the\r\ninstitution, notwithstanding this well-concerted scheme, fell into\r\ndisrepute, owing to a cloud of claimants who were fired with the rage of\r\nversifying, and who, though destitute of poetic talents, had the laurel\r\nbestowed on them. Thus it became a prostituted honour; and satires were\r\nincessantly levelled against the usurpers of the crown of Apollo: it\r\nseems, notwithstanding, always to have had charms in the eyes of the\r\nGermans, who did not reflect, as the Abbé elegantly expresses himself,\r\nthat it faded when it passed over so many heads.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Germany retains the laureatship in all its splendour. The\r\nselected bard is called _Il Poeta Cesareo_. APOSTOLO ZENO, as celebrated\r\nfor his erudition as for his poetic powers, was succeeded by that most\r\nenchanting poet, METASTASIO.\r\n\r\nThe French never had a _Poet Laureat_, though they had _Regal Poets_;\r\nfor none were ever solemnly crowned. The Spanish nation, always desirous\r\nof titles of honour, seem to have known that of the _Laureat_; but\r\nlittle information concerning it can be gathered from their authors.\r\n\r\nRespecting our own country little can be added to the information of\r\nSelden. John Kay, who dedicated a History of Rhodes to Edward IV., takes\r\nthe title of his _humble Poet Laureat_. Gower and Chaucer were laureats;\r\nso was likewise Skelton to Henry VIII. In the Acts of Rymer, there is a\r\ncharter of Henry VII. with the title of _pro Poeta Laureato_, t hat is,\r\nperhaps, only _a Poet laureated at the university_, in the king's\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nOur poets were never solemnly crowned as in other countries. Selden,\r\nafter all his recondite researches, is satisfied with saying, that some\r\ntrace of this distinction is to be found in our nation. Our kings from\r\ntime immemorial have placed a miserable dependent in their household\r\nappointment, who was sometimes called the _King's poet_, and the _King's\r\nversificator_. It is probable that at length the selected bard assumed\r\nthe title of _Poet Laureat_, without receiving the honours of the\r\nceremony; or, at the most, the _crown of laurel_ was a mere obscure\r\ncustom practised at our universities, and not attended with great public\r\ndistinction. It was oftener placed on the skull of a pedant than\r\nwreathed on the head of a man of genius. Shadwell united the offices\r\nboth of Poet Laureat and Historiographer; and by a MS. account of the\r\npublic revenue, it appears that for two years' salary he received six\r\nhundred pounds. At his death Rymer became the Historiographer and Tate\r\nthe Laureat: both offices seem equally useless, but, if united, will not\r\nprove so to the Poet Laureat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANGELO POLITIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAngelo Politian, an Italian, was one of the most polished writers of the\r\nfifteenth century. Baillet has placed him amongst his celebrated\r\nchildren; for he was a writer at twelve years of age. The Muses indeed\r\ncherished him in his cradle, and the Graces hung round it their wreaths.\r\nWhen he became professor of the Greek language, such were the charms of\r\nhis lectures, that Chalcondylas, a native of Greece, saw himself\r\nabandoned by his pupils, who resorted to the delightful disquisitions of\r\nthe elegant Politian. Critics of various nations have acknowledged that\r\nhis poetical versions have frequently excelled the originals. This happy\r\ngenius was lodged in a most unhappy form; nor were his morals untainted:\r\nit is only in his literary compositions that he appears perfect.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of his Epistles, here is one, which serves as prefatory\r\nand dedicatory. The letter is replete with literature, though void of\r\npedantry; a barren subject is embellished by its happy turns. Perhaps no\r\nauthor has more playfully defended himself from the incertitude of\r\ncriticism and the fastidiousness of critics.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY LORD,\r\n\r\nYou have frequently urged me to collect my letters, to revise and to\r\npublish them in a volume. I have now gathered them, that I might not\r\nomit any mark of that obedience which I owe to him, on whom I rest all\r\nmy hopes, and all my prosperity. I have not, however, collected them\r\nall, because that would have been a more laborious task than to have\r\ngathered the scattered leaves of the Sibyl. It was never, indeed, with\r\nan intention of forming my letters into one body that I wrote them, but\r\nmerely as occasion prompted, and as the subjects presented themselves\r\nwithout seeking for them. I never retained copies except of a few,\r\nwhich, less fortunate, I think, than the others, were thus favoured for\r\nthe sake of the verses they contained. To form, however, a tolerable\r\nvolume, I have also inserted some written by others, but only those with\r\nwhich several ingenious scholars favoured me, and which, perhaps, may\r\nput the reader in good humour with my own.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing for which some will be inclined to censure me; the\r\nstyle of my letters is very unequal; and, to confess the truth, I did\r\nnot find myself always in the same humour, and the same modes of\r\nexpression were not adapted to every person and every topic. They will\r\nnot fail then to observe, when they read such a diversity of letters (I\r\nmean if they do read them), that I have composed not epistles, but (once\r\nmore) miscellanies.\r\n\r\nI hope, my Lord, notwithstanding this, that amongst such a variety of\r\nopinions, of those who write letters, and of those who give precepts how\r\nletters should be written, I shall find some apology. Some, probably,\r\nwill deny that they are Ciceronian. I can answer such, and not without\r\ngood authority, that in epistolary composition we must not regard Cicero\r\nas a model. Another perhaps will say that I imitate Cicero. And him I\r\nwill answer by observing, that I wish nothing better than to be capable\r\nof grasping something of this great man, were it but his shadow!\r\n\r\nAnother will wish that I had borrowed a little from the manner of Pliny\r\nthe orator, because his profound sense and accuracy were greatly\r\nesteemed. I shall oppose him by expressing my contempt of all writers of\r\nthe age of Pliny. If it should be observed, that I have imitated the\r\nmanner of Pliny, I shall then screen myself by what Sidonius\r\nApollinaris, an author who is by no means disreputable, says in\r\ncommendation of his epistolary style. Do I resemble Symmachus? I shall\r\nnot be sorry, for they distinguish his openness and conciseness. Am I\r\nconsidered in nowise resembling him? I shall confess that I am not\r\npleased with his dry manner.\r\n\r\nWill my letters be condemned for their length? Plato, Aristotle,\r\nThucydides, and Cicero, have all written long ones. Will some of them be\r\ncriticised for their brevity? I allege in my favour the examples of\r\nDion, Brutus, Apollonius, Philostratus, Marcus Antoninus, Alciphron,\r\nJulian, Symmachus, and also Lucian, who vulgarly, but falsely, is\r\nbelieved to have been Phalaris.\r\n\r\nI shall be censured for having treated of topics which are not generally\r\nconsidered as proper for epistolary composition. I admit this censure,\r\nprovided, while I am condemned, Seneca also shares in the condemnation.\r\nAnother will not allow of a sententious manner in my letters; I will\r\nstill justify myself by Seneca. Another, on the contrary, desires abrupt\r\nsententious periods; Dionysius shall answer him for me, who maintains\r\nthat pointed sentences should not be admitted into letters.\r\n\r\nIs my style too perspicuous? It is precisely that which Philostratus\r\nadmires. Is it obscure? Such is that of Cicero to Attica. Negligent? An\r\nagreeable negligence in letters is more graceful than elaborate\r\nornaments. Laboured? Nothing can be more proper, since we send epistles\r\nto our friends as a kind of presents. If they display too nice an\r\narrangement, the Halicarnassian shall vindicate me. If there is none;\r\nArtemon says there should be none.\r\n\r\nNow as a good and pure Latinity has its peculiar taste, its manners,\r\nand, to express myself thus, its Atticisms; if in this sense a letter\r\nshall be found not sufficiently Attic, so much the better; for what was\r\nHerod the sophist censured? but that having been born an Athenian, he\r\naffected too much to appear one in his language. Should a letter seem\r\ntoo Attical; still better, since it was by discovering Theophrastus, who\r\nwas no Athenian, that a good old woman of Athens laid hold of a word,\r\nand shamed him.\r\n\r\nShall one letter be found not sufficiently serious? I love to jest. Or\r\nis it too grave? I am pleased with gravity. Is another full of figures?\r\nLetters being the images of discourse, figures have the effect of\r\ngraceful action in conversation. Are they deficient in figures? This is\r\njust what characterises a letter, this want of figure! Does it discover\r\nthe genius of the writer? This frankness is recommended. Does it conceal\r\nit? The writer did not think proper to paint himself; and it is one\r\nrequisite in a letter, that it should be void of ostentation. You\r\nexpress yourself, some one will observe, in common terms on common\r\ntopics, and in new terms on new topics. The style is thus adapted to the\r\nsubject. No, no, he will answer; it is in common terms you express new\r\nideas, and in new terms common ideas. Very well! It is because I have\r\nnot forgotten an ancient Greek precept which expressly recommends this.\r\n\r\nIt is thus by attempting to be ambidextrous, I try to ward off attacks.\r\nMy critics, however, will criticise me as they please. It will be\r\nsufficient for me, my Lord, to be assured of having satisfied you, by my\r\nletters, if they are good; or by my obedience, if they are not so.\r\n\r\n    Florence, 1494.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL LETTER OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Cottonian Library, Vespasian, F. III. is preserved a letter\r\nwritten by Queen Elizabeth, then Princess. Her brother, Edward the\r\nSixth, had desired to have her picture; and in gratifying the wishes of\r\nhis majesty, Elizabeth accompanies the present with an elaborate letter.\r\nIt bears no date of the _year_ in which it was written; but her place of\r\nresidence was at Hatfield. There she had retired to enjoy the silent\r\npleasures of a studious life, and to be distant from the dangerous\r\npolitics of the time. When Mary died, Elizabeth was still at Hatfield.\r\nAt the time of its composition she was in habitual intercourse with the\r\nmost excellent writers of antiquity: her letter displays this in every\r\npart of it; but it is too rhetorical. It is here now first published.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER.\r\n\r\n\"Like as the riche man that dayly gathereth riches to riches, and to one\r\nbag of money layeth a greate sort til it come to infinit, so me thinkes,\r\nyour Majestie not beinge suffised with many benefits and gentilnes\r\nshewed to me afore this time, dothe now increase them in askinge and\r\ndesiring wher you may bid and comaunde, requiring a thinge not worthy\r\nthe desiringe for it selfe, but made worthy for your highness request.\r\nMy pictur I mene, in wiche if the inward good mynde towarde your grace\r\nmight as wel be declared as the outwarde face and countenance shal be\r\nseen, I wold nor haue taried the comandement but prevent it, nor haue\r\nbine the last to graunt but the first to offer it.

It is in the artless recitals of memoir-writers, that the\r\nimagination is struck with a lively impression, and fastens on petty\r\ncircumstances, which must be passed over by the classical historian. The\r\nwritings of Brantome, Comines, Froissart, and others, are dictated by\r\ntheir natural feelings: while the passions of modern writers are\r\ntemperate with dispassionate philosophy, or inflamed by the virulence of\r\nfaction. History instructs, but Memoirs delight. These prefatory\r\nobservations may serve as an apology for Anecdotes which are gathered\r\nfrom obscure corners, on which the dignity of the historian must not\r\ndwell.\r\n\r\nIn Houssaie's _Memoirs_, Vol. I. p. 435, a little circumstance is\r\nrecorded concerning the decapitation of the unfortunate Anne Bullen,\r\nwhich illustrates an observation of Hume. Our historian notices that her\r\nexecutioner was a Frenchman of Calais, who was supposed to have uncommon\r\nskill. It is probable that the following incident might have been\r\npreserved by tradition in France, from the account of the executioner\r\nhimself:--Anne Bullen being on the scaffold, would not consent to have\r\nher eyes covered with a bandage, saying that she had no fear of death.\r\nAll that the divine who assisted at her execution could obtain from her\r\nwas, that she would shut her eyes. But as she was opening them at every\r\nmoment, the executioner could not bear their tender and mild glances;\r\nfearful of missing his aim, he was obliged to invent an expedient to\r\nbehead the queen. He drew off his shoes, and approached her silently;\r\nwhile he was at her left hand, another person advanced at her right, who\r\nmade a great noise in walking, so that this circumstance drawing the\r\nattention of Anne, she turned her face from the executioner, who was\r\nenabled by this artifice to strike the fatal blow, without being\r\ndisarmed by that spirit of affecting resignation which shone in the eyes\r\nof the lovely Anne Bullen.\r\n\r\n            The Common Executioner,\r\n    Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,\r\n    Falls not the axe upon the humble neck\r\n    But first begs pardon.\r\n\r\n                SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was usual, in the reign of James the First, when they compared it\r\nwith the preceding glorious one, to distinguish him by the title of\r\n_Queen James_, and his illustrious predecessor by that of _King\r\nElizabeth_! Sir Anthony Weldon informs us, \"That when James the First\r\nsent Sir Roger Aston as his messenger to Elizabeth, Sir Roger was always\r\nplaced in the lobby: the hangings being turned so that he might see the\r\nQueen dancing to a little fiddle, which was to no other end than that he\r\nshould tell his master, by her youthful disposition, how likely he was\r\nto come to the crown he so much thirsted after;\"--and, indeed, when at\r\nher death this same knight, whose origin was low, and whose language was\r\nsuitable to that origin, appeared before the English council, he could\r\nnot conceal his Scottish rapture, for, asked how the king did? he\r\nreplied, \"Even, my lords, like a poore man wandering about forty years\r\nin a wildernesse and barren soyle, and now arrived at the _Land of\r\nPromise_.\" A curious anecdote, respecting the economy of the court in\r\nthese reigns, is noticed in some manuscript memoirs written in James's\r\nreign, preserved in a family of distinction. The lady, who wrote these\r\nmemoirs, tells us that a great change had taken place in _cleanliness_,\r\nsince the last reign; for, having rose from her chair, she found, on her\r\ndeparture, that she had the honour of carrying _upon_ her some\r\ncompanions who must have been inhabitants of the palace. The court of\r\nElizabeth was celebrated occasionally for its magnificence, and always\r\nfor its nicety. James was singularly effeminate; he could not behold a\r\ndrawn sword without shuddering; was much too partial to handsome men;\r\nand appears to merit the bitter satire of Churchill. If wanting other\r\nproofs, we should only read the second volume of \"Royal Letters,\" 6987,\r\nin the Harleian collections, which contains Stenie's correspondence with\r\nJames. The gross familiarity of Buckingham's address is couched in such\r\nterms as these:--he calls his majesty \"Dere dad and Gossope!\" and\r\nconcludes his letters with \"your humble slaue and dogge, Stenie.\"[121]\r\nHe was a most weak, but not quite a vicious man; yet his expertness in\r\nthe art of dissimulation was very great indeed. He called this\r\n_King-Craft_. Sir Anthony Weldon gives a lively anecdote of this\r\ndissimulation in the king's behaviour to the Earl of Somerset at the\r\nvery moment he had prepared to disgrace him. The earl accompanied the\r\nking to Royston, and, to his apprehension, never parted from him with\r\nmore seeming affection, though the king well knew he should never see\r\nhim more. \"The earl, when he kissed his hand, the king hung about his\r\nneck, slabbering his cheeks, saying--'For God's sake, when shall I see\r\nthee again? On my soul I shall neither eat nor sleep until you come\r\nagain.' The earl told him on Monday (this being on the Friday). 'For\r\nGod's sake let me,' said the king:--'Shall I, shall I?'--then lolled\r\nabout his neck; 'then for God's sake give thy lady this kisse for me, in\r\nthe same manner at the stayre's head, at the middle of the stayres, and\r\nat the stayre's foot.' The earl was not in his coach when the king used\r\nthese very words (in the hearing of four servants, one of whom reported\r\nit instantly to the author of this history), 'I shall never see his face\r\nmore.'\"\r\n\r\nHe displayed great imbecility in his amusements, which are characterised\r\nby the following one, related by Arthur Wilson:--When James became\r\nmelancholy in consequence of various disappointments in state matters,\r\nBuckingham and his mother used several means of diverting him. Amongst\r\nthe most ludicrous was the present. They had a young lady, who brought a\r\npig in the dress of a new-born infant: the countess carried it to the\r\nking, wrapped in a rich mantle. One Turpin, on this occasion, was\r\ndressed like a bishop in all his pontifical ornaments. He began the\r\nrites of baptism with the common prayer-book in his hand; a silver ewer\r\nwith water was held by another. The marquis stood as godfather. When\r\nJames turned to look at the infant, the pig squeaked: an animal which he\r\ngreatly abhorred. At this, highly displeased, he exclaimed,--\"Out! Away\r\nfor shame! What blasphemy is this!\"\r\n\r\nThis ridiculous joke did not accord with the feelings of James at that\r\nmoment; he was not \"i' the vein.\" Yet we may observe, that had not such\r\nartful politicians as Buckingham and his mother been strongly persuaded\r\nof the success of this puerile fancy, they would not have ventured on\r\nsuch \"blasphemies.\" They certainly had witnessed amusements heretofore\r\nnot less trivial which had gratified his majesty. The account which Sir\r\nAnthony Weldon gives, in his Court of King James, exhibits a curious\r\nscene of James's amusements. \"After the king supped, he would come\r\nforth to see pastimes and fooleries; in which Sir Ed. Zouch, Sir George\r\nGoring, and Sir John Finit, were the chiefe and master fools, and surely\r\nthis fooling got them more than any others wisdome; Zouch's part was to\r\nsing bawdy songs, and tell bawdy tales; Finit's to compose these songs:\r\nthere was a set of fiddlers brought to court on purpose for this\r\nfooling, and Goring was master of the game for fooleries, sometimes\r\npresenting David Droman and Archee Armstrong, the kings foole, on the\r\nback of the other fools, to tilt one at another, till they fell together\r\nby the eares; sometimes they performed antick dances. But Sir John\r\nMillicent (who was never known before) was commended for notable\r\nfooling; and was indeed the best _extemporary foole_ of them all.\"\r\nWeldon's \"Court of James\" is a scandalous chronicle of the times.\r\n\r\nHis dispositions were, however, generally grave and studious. He seems\r\nto have possessed a real love of letters, but attended with that\r\nmediocrity of talent which in a private person had never raised him into\r\nnotice. \"While there was a chance,\" writes the author of the Catalogue\r\nof Noble Authors, \"that the dyer's son, Vorstius, might be\r\ndivinity-professor at Leyden, instead of being burnt, as his majesty\r\nhinted _to the Christian prudence_ of the Dutch that he deserved to be,\r\nour ambassadors could not receive instructions, and consequently could\r\nnot treat on any other business. The king, who did not resent the\r\nmassacre at Amboyna, was on the point of breaking with the States for\r\nsupporting a man who professed the heresies of Enjedius, Ostodorus, &c.,\r\npoints of extreme consequence to Great Britain! Sir Dudley Carleton was\r\nforced to threaten the Dutch, not only with the hatred of King James,\r\nbut also with his pen.\"\r\n\r\nThis royal pedant is forcibly characterised by the following\r\nobservations of the same writer:--\r\n\r\n\"Among his majesty's works is a small collection of poetry. Like several\r\nof his subjects, our royal author has condescended to apologise for its\r\nimperfections, as having been written in his youth, and his maturer age\r\nbeing otherwise occupied. So that (to employ his own language) 'when his\r\ningyne and age could, his affaires and fascherie would not permit him to\r\ncorrect them, scarslie but at stolen moments, he having the leisure to\r\nblenk upon any paper.' When James sent a present of his harangues,\r\nturned into Latin, to the Protestant princes in Europe, it is not\r\nunentertaining to observe in their answers of compliments and thanks,\r\nhow each endeavoured to insinuate that he had read them, without\r\npositively asserting it! Buchanan, when asked how he came to make a\r\npedant of his royal pupil, answered that it was the best he could make\r\nof him. Sir George Mackenzie relates a story of his tutelage, which\r\nshows Buchanan's humour, and the veneration of others for royalty. The\r\nyoung king being one day at play with his fellow-pupil, the master of\r\nErskine, Buchanan was reading, and desired them to make less noise. As\r\nthey disregarded his admonition, he told his majesty, if he did not hold\r\nhis tongue, he would certainly whip his breech. The king replied, he\r\nwould be glad to see who would _bell the cat_, alluding to the fable.\r\nBuchanan lost his temper, and throwing his book from him, gave his\r\nmajesty a sound flogging. The old countess of Mar rushed into the room,\r\nand taking the king in her arms, asked how he dared to lay his hands on\r\nthe Lord's anointed? Madam, replied the elegant and immortal historian,\r\nI have whipped his a----, you may kiss it if you please!\"\r\n\r\nMany years after this was published, I discovered a curious\r\nanecdote:--Even so late as when James I. was seated on the throne of\r\nEngland, once the appearance of his _frowning tutor in a dream_ greatly\r\nagitated the king, who in vain attempted to pacify his illustrious\r\npedagogue in this portentous vision. Such was the terror which the\r\nremembrance of this inexorable republican tutor had left on the\r\nimagination of his royal pupil.\r\n\r\nJames I. was certainly a zealous votary of literature; his wish was\r\nsincere, when at viewing the Bodleian Library at Oxford, he exclaimed,\r\n\"Were I not a king I would be an university man; and if it were so that\r\nI must be a prisoner, if I might have my wish, I would have no other\r\nprison than this library, and be chained together with these good\r\nauthors.\"\r\n\r\nHume has informed us, that \"his death was decent.\" The following are the\r\nminute particulars: I have drawn them from an imperfect manuscript\r\ncollection, made by the celebrated Sir Thomas Browne.\r\n\r\n\"The lord keeper, on March 22, received a letter from the court, that it\r\nwas feared his majesty's sickness was dangerous to death; which fear was\r\nmore confirmed, for he, meeting Dr. Harvey in the road, was told by him\r\nthat the king used to have a beneficial evacuation of nature, a\r\nsweating in his left arm, as helpful to him as any fontenel could be,\r\nwhich of late failed.\r\n\r\n\"When the lord keeper presented himself before him, he moved to cheerful\r\ndiscourse, but it would not do. He stayed by his bedside until midnight.\r\nUpon the consultations of the physicians in the morning he was out of\r\ncomfort, and by the prince's leave told him, kneeling by his pallet,\r\nthat his days to come would be but few in this world. '_I am\r\nsatisfied_,' said the king; 'but pray you assist me to make me ready for\r\nthe next world, to go away hence for Christ, whose mercies I call for,\r\nand hope to find.'\r\n\r\n\"From that time the keeper never left him, or put off his clothes to go\r\nto bed. The king took the communion, and professed he died in the bosom\r\nof the Church of England, whose doctrine he had defended with his pen,\r\nbeing persuaded it was according to the mind of Christ, as he should\r\nshortly answer it before him.\r\n\r\n\"He stayed in the chamber to take notice of everything the king said,\r\nand to repulse those who crept much about the chamber door, and into the\r\nchamber; they were for the most addicted to the Church of Rome. Being\r\nrid of them, he continued in prayer, while the king lingered on, and at\r\nlast _shut his eyes with his own hands_.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in the full power of his faculties, a timorous prince\r\n\r\nencountered the horrors of dissolution. _Religion_ rendered cheerful the\r\nabrupt night of futurity; and what can _philosophy_ do more, or rather,\r\ncan philosophy do as much?\r\n\r\nI proposed to have examined with some care the works of James I.; but\r\nthat uninviting task has been now postponed till it is too late. As a\r\nwriter, his works may not be valuable, and are infected with the\r\npedantry and the superstition of the age; yet I _suspect_ that James was\r\nnot that degraded and feeble character in which he ranks by the\r\ncontagious voice of criticism. He has had more critics than readers.\r\nAfter a great number of acute observations and witty allusions, made\r\nextempore, which we find continually recorded of him by contemporary\r\nwriters, and some not friendly to him, I conclude that he possessed a\r\ngreat promptness of wit, and much solid judgment and acute ingenuity. It\r\nrequires only a little labour to prove this.\r\n\r\nThat labour I have since zealously performed. This article, composed\r\n_more than thirty years_ ago, displays the effects of first impressions\r\nand popular clamours. About _ten_ years I _suspected_ that his character\r\nwas grossly injured, and _lately_ I found how it has suffered from a\r\nvariety of causes. That monarch preserved for us a peace of more than\r\ntwenty years; and his talents were of a higher order than the calumnies\r\nof the party who have remorselessly degraded him have allowed a common\r\ninquirer to discover. For the rest I must refer the reader to \"An\r\nInquiry into the Literary and Political Character of James I.;\" in which\r\nhe may find many correctives for this article. I shall in a future work\r\nenter into further explanations of this ambiguous royal author.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: Buckingham's style was even stronger and coarser than the\r\ntext leads one to suppose. \"Your sowship\" is the beginning of one\r\nletter, and \"I kiss your dirty hands\" the conclusion of another. The\r\nking had encouraged this by his own extraordinary familiarity. \"My own\r\nsweet and dear child,\" \"Sweet hearty,\" \"My sweet Steenie and gossip,\"\r\nare the commencements of the royal epistles to Buckingham; and in one\r\ninstance, where he proposes a hunting party and invites the ladies of\r\nhis family, he does it in words of perfect obscenity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL MONK AND HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the MS. collection of Sir Thomas Browne, I shall rescue an\r\nanecdote, which has a tendency to show that it is not advisable to\r\npermit ladies to remain at home, when political plots are to be secretly\r\ndiscussed. And while it displays the treachery of Monk's wife, it will\r\nalso appear that, like other great revolutionists, it was ambition that\r\nfirst induced him to become the reformer he pretended to be.\r\n\r\n\"Monk gave fair promises to the Rump, but last agreed with the French\r\nAmbassador to take the government on himself; by whom he had a promise\r\nfrom Mazarin of assistance from France. This bargain was struck late at\r\nnight: but not so secretly but that Monk's wife, who had posted herself\r\nconveniently behind the hangings, finding what was resolved upon, sent\r\nher brother Clarges away immediately with notice of it to Sir A.A. She\r\nhad promised to watch her husband, and inform Sir A. how matters went.\r\nSir A. caused the council of state, whereof he was a member, to be\r\nsummoned, and charged Monk that he was playing false. The general\r\ninsisted that he was true to his principles, and firm to what he had\r\npromised, and that he was ready to give them all satisfaction. Sir A.\r\ntold him if he were sincere he might remove all scruples, and should\r\ninstantly take away their commissions from such and such men in his\r\narmy, and appoint others, and that before he left the room. Monk\r\nconsented; a great part of the commissions of his officers were changed,\r\nand Sir Edward Harley, a member of the council, and then present was\r\nmade governor of Dunkirk, in the room of Sir William Lockhart; the army\r\nceased to be at Monk's devotion; the ambassador was recalled, and broke\r\nhis heart.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the effects of the infidelity of the wife of General Monk!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP AND MARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoussaie, in his Mémoires, vol. i. p. 261, has given the following\r\ncurious particulars of this singular union:--\r\n\r\n     \"The second wife of Philip was Mary Queen of England; a virtuous\r\n     princess (Houssaie was a good catholic), but who had neither youth\r\n     nor beauty. This marriage was as little happy for the one as for\r\n     the other. The husband did not like his wife, although she doted on\r\n     him; and the English hated Philip still more than he hated them.\r\n     Silhon says, that the rigour which he exercised in England against\r\n     heretics partly hindered Prince Carlos from succeeding to that\r\n     crown, and for _which purpose_ Mary had invited him in case she\r\n     died childless!\"--But no historian speaks of this pretended\r\n     inclination, and is it probable that Mary ever thought proper to\r\n     call to the succession of the English throne the son of the Spanish\r\n     Monarch? This marriage had made her nation detest her, and in the\r\n     last years of her life she could be little satisfied with him, from\r\n     his marked indifference for her. She well knew that the Parliament\r\n     would never consent to exclude her sister Elizabeth, whom the\r\n     nobility loved for being more friendly to the new religion, and\r\n     more hostile to the house of Austria.\r\n\r\n     In the Cottonian Library, Vespasian F. III. is preserved a note of\r\n     instructions in the handwriting of Queen Mary, of which the\r\n     following is a copy. It was, probably, written when Philip was just\r\n     seated on the English throne.\r\n\r\n     \"Instructions for my lorde Previsel.\r\n\r\n     \"Firste, to tell the Kinge the whole state of this realme, wt all\r\n     things appartaynyng to the same, as myche as ye knowe to be trewe.\r\n\r\n     \"Seconde, to obey his commandment in all thyngs.\r\n\r\n     \"Thyrdly, in all things he shall aske your aduyse to declare your\r\n     opinion as becometh a faythfull conceyllour to do.\r\n\r\n                                         \"MARY the Quene.\"\r\n\r\nHoussaie proceeds: \"After the death of Mary, Philip sought Elizabeth in\r\nmarriage; and she, who was yet unfixed at the beginning of her reign,\r\namused him at first with hopes. But as soon as she unmasked herself to\r\nthe pope, she laughed at Philip, telling the Duke of Feria, his\r\nambassador, that her conscience would not permit her to marry the\r\nhusband of her sister.\"\r\n\r\nThis monarch, however, had no such scruples. Incest appears to have had\r\nin his eyes peculiar charms; for he offered himself three times to three\r\ndifferent sisters-in-law. He seems also to have known the secret of\r\ngetting quit of his wives when they became inconvenient. In state\r\nmatters he spared no one whom he feared; to them he sacrificed his only\r\nson, his brother, and a great number of princes and ministers.\r\n\r\nIt is said of Philip, that before he died he advised his son to make\r\npeace with England, and war with the other powers. _Pacem cum Anglo,\r\nbellum cum reliquis_. Queen Elizabeth, and the ruin of his invincible\r\nfleet, physicked his frenzy into health, and taught him to fear and\r\nrespect that country which he thought he could have made a province of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nOn his death-bed he did everything he could for _salvation_. The\r\nfollowing protestation, a curious morsel of bigotry, he sent to his\r\nconfessor a few days before he died:--\r\n\r\n\"Father confessor! as you occupy the place of God, I protest to you that\r\nI will do everything you shall say to be necessary for my being saved;\r\nso that what I omit doing will be placed to your account, as I am ready\r\nto acquit myself of all that shall be ordered to me.\"\r\n\r\nIs there, in the records of history, a more glaring instance of the idea\r\nwhich a good Catholic attaches to the power of a confessor, than the\r\npresent authentic example? The most licentious philosophy seems not more\r\ndangerous than a religion whose votary believes that the accumulation of\r\ncrimes can be dissipated by the breath of a few orisons, and which,\r\nconsidering a venal priest to \"occupy the place of God,\" can traffic\r\nwith the divine power at a very moderate price.\r\n\r\nAfter his death a Spanish grandee wrote with a coal on the\r\nchimney-piece of his chamber the following epitaph, which ingeniously\r\npaints his character in four verses:--\r\n\r\n    Siendo moço luxurioso;\r\n    Siendo hombre, fue cruel;\r\n    Siendo viejo, codicioso:\r\n    Que se puede esperar del?\r\n\r\n    In youth he was luxurious;\r\n    In manhood he was cruel;\r\n    In old age he was avaricious:\r\n    What could be hoped from him?\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
