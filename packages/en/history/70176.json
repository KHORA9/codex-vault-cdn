TINLING AND CO.,\r\n  PRINTERS,\r\n  VICTORIA STREET, LIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe historical information contained in this volume has been\r\nin a large measure collected from the Press of the period, and\r\nchiefly from the _Times_, _Liverpool Mercury_, _Glasgow Herald_,\r\nand _Chambers’ Journal_. Lindsay’s “_Merchant Shipping_,” a most\r\nadmirable work, has also been consulted, as well as other works of\r\na similar nature. The name of the authority quoted has been given\r\nin most cases, but, where I have been unable to do so, I trust this\r\ngeneral acknowledgment will suffice.\r\n\r\nSome of the chapters in Part II. were contributed in 1901 to the\r\n_Journal of Commerce_, as part of a series of articles on “Historical\r\nSteamship Companies.” Chapter XXII. in Part I. was published in the\r\nMay number (1903) of the _Wide World Magazine_, under the title of\r\n“The Strange Case of the FERRET.”\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of thanking the Directors, Managers, Agents,\r\nand other officials of the various Steamship Companies referred\r\nto, by all of whom, and at all times, I have been treated with the\r\nutmost courtesy. I desire also to express my appreciation of the\r\nuniform kindness and assistance received from the Librarians of the\r\nBootle, Glasgow, and Liverpool Libraries in placing at my disposal\r\npublications, some of which were printed nearly a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n  JOHN KENNEDY.\r\n\r\n  LIVERPOOL, _20th November, 1903_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I.\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.—Inventors and Alleged Inventors prior to 1807.—De Garay\r\n  (1543)—Papin (1690)—Savory, Newcomen (1705)—Hulls (1736)—Abbé\r\n  Arnal and the Marquis de Jouffroy (1781)—Fitch (1783)—Miller and\r\n  Taylor (1788)—Symington (1801)—The CHARLOTTE DUNDAS (1803)—Bell\r\n  (1803)                                                             1\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.—Fulton (1807)—The CLERMONT (1807), the first passenger\r\n  steamboat in the world—Narrative of her first voyage—Steam\r\n  Navigation in Canadian waters—First steamers on the St.\r\n  Lawrence—The ACCOMMODATION (1809)—SWIFTSURE, CAR OF COMMERCE\r\n  (1813)—QUEBEC (1817)                                               7\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.—1812 to 1815—Steamboats on the Clyde—THE COMET,\r\n  INDUSTRY and ARGYLE—First Irish Steamer, CITY OF CORK\r\n  (1815)—Ireland’s honourable position in the annals of steam\r\n  navigation—First London Steampackets, MARJORY, DEFIANCE and\r\n  THAMES                                                            11\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.—The year 1815—Arrival of the first steampacket on the\r\n  Mersey—Narrative of the voyage of the THAMES from Glasgow to\r\n  London                                                            15\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.—1816 to 1818—London packets, the DEFIANCE, MAJESTIC,\r\n  REGENT—Loss of the REGENT (1817)—Liverpool and Eastham\r\n  Packet, PRINCESS CHARLOTTE (1816)—Liverpool and Tranmere\r\n  Packets REGULATOR, ETNA (1817)—Parkgate and Bagillt Packet,\r\n  ANCIENT BRITON (1817)—Loss of the REGULATOR (1818)—First Spanish\r\n  Steamer, ROYAL FERDINAND (1817)—Siberian Steamboats (1817)—David\r\n  Napier—The ROB ROY, HIBERNIA (1816)                               23\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI.—Early Clyde Steampackets—The first steamer to cross\r\n  the English Channel, CALEDONIA—First steamer on the Rhine\r\n  (1816)—Season contract tickets issued (1816)—Stranding of the\r\n  ROTHESAY CASTLE (1816)—Steamship passengers’ fares on the Clyde\r\n  in 1818—DUMBARTON CASTLE steams round North of Scotland (1819)    27\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII.—1819 to 1821—The first steamer to cross the Atlantic,\r\n  the SAVANNAH—Arrival at Liverpool of the first cross-channel\r\n  steamer, WATERLOO—The ROBERT BRUCE—Curious accident to the\r\n  MORNING STAR—The TRITON—CONDE DE PATMELLA—SNAKE—Cattle\r\n  ventilators suggested—The TOURIST—London and Leith\r\n  steamers                                                          32\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII.—The St. George Steampacket Co.—Steam Yacht\r\n  HERO—Liverpool steampackets highly commended in Parliamentary\r\n  Report—AARON MANBY, first iron steamer—First steamer Hull\r\n  to Continent—City of Dublin Steampacket Co.—Dublin and Liverpool\r\n  Steam Navigation Co.—H.M.S.

It is a\r\nrecord of the triumphs of Science and Art in Marine Architecture; of\r\nbold enterprises—not always carried to a successful financial issue;\r\nof deeds of “derring do” as romantic as the older stories of the\r\nVikings. It is a page brightened by stories of true heroism, where\r\nmen have bravely faced death, not in the lust of battle, but in calm\r\ndevotion to duty, or in unflinching determination to save the lives\r\nof those weaker than themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, nor would it answer any useful purpose, to\r\ndiscuss fully the various claims which have been put forward for the\r\nhonour of having invented the first Marine Steam Engine. It will be\r\nsufficient to refer briefly to the inventors, or alleged inventors,\r\nprior to the year 1807.\r\n\r\nIn the Appendix to Señor Navarette’s “History of the Four Voyages\r\nof Columbus,” are copies of certain documents which the historian\r\nvouches to be authentic extracts from the series of Spanish Records\r\npreserved at Simancas. These documents narrate “that in the month of\r\nMay or June, 1543, Blasco de Garay, a naval captain in the service\r\nof the Emperor Charles V., conducted at Barcelona, a series of\r\nexperiments upon the applicability to ships of a certain propulsive\r\nforce, which he alleges he had himself discovered.” De Garay\r\ndescribes the mechanism he employed as consisting of two wheels, one\r\nattached to either extremity of a movable axis which traversed the\r\nvessel’s waist, and was connected with a large caldron of boiling\r\nwater. The experiments, it is alleged, were conducted in the presence\r\nof several persons of high birth, deputed by the Emperor to witness\r\nthem, and amongst whom were many naval commanders. It is further\r\nalleged that De Garay succeeded in taking to sea a vessel of two\r\nhundred tons burthen, without the aid of sail or oar, and that her\r\nspeed was about one league per hour.[3]\r\n\r\nRear-Admiral Geo. Preble, U.S.N., author of a “History of Steam\r\nNavigation,” gives the names of several persons who have searched\r\nthe documents referred to, none of whom have been able to trace any\r\nmention of steam; he, therefore, concludes that the account of De\r\nGaray’s invention is a Spanish legend. [4] Papin, who was driven from\r\nFrance by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and was elected\r\nF.R.S. in 1681, describes, in 1690, a steam cylinder in which a\r\npiston descends by atmospheric pressure, and, as one of its uses, he\r\nmentions the propulsion of ships by paddle wheels. Towards the close\r\nof the 17th century, or the beginning of the 18th, Papin made the\r\nacquaintance of Thomas Savory, one of the most ingenious men of his\r\ntimes, and of Thomas Newcomen, a working blacksmith, of Devon. Savory\r\ndesigned a marine engine, which was greatly improved by Newcomen in\r\n1705, and was used by Papin to propel a steamboat on the Fulda.\r\n\r\nThirty years later (1736), Jonathan Hulls, of Berwick-on-Tweed,\r\nreceived a patent for the first steamboat of which there is any\r\nauthentic record from George II., which recited as follows:—\r\n\r\n  [5]“Whereas our trusty and well-beloved Jonathan Hulls hath by his\r\n  petition humbly represented unto our most dearly beloved Consort,\r\n  the Queen, that he hath, with much labour and with great expense,\r\n  invented and formed a machine for towing ships and vessels out of,\r\n  or into any harbour or river, against wind or tide, or in a calm,\r\n  which the petitioner apprehends may be of great service to our\r\n  Royal Party and merchant ships, and to boats and other vessels, of\r\n  which the petitioner hath made oath that he is the sole inventor,\r\n  as by affidavit to his said petition annexed.\r\n\r\n  “Know ye, therefore, that we, of our special grace, hath given and\r\n  granted to the said Jonathan Hulls our special license, full power,\r\n  sole privilege and authority during the term of fourteen years, and\r\n  he shall lawfully make use of the same for carrying ships and other\r\n  vessels out to sea, or into any harbour or river.\r\n\r\n  “In witness whereof we have caused these our letters to be made\r\n  patent.\r\n\r\n  “(Witness) CAROLINE,\r\n\r\n  “Queen of Great Britain, &c.\r\n\r\n  “Given by right of Privy Seal at Westminster, this 21st day of\r\n  December, 1736.”\r\n\r\nIn the description of his invention, Hulls states that, in his\r\nopinion, it would not be practicable to place his machine on anything\r\nbut a tow-boat, as it would take up too much room for other goods\r\nto be carried on the same vessel with it, and it could not “be used\r\nin a storm, or when the waves are very raging.” Hulls’ vessel is\r\nstated to have been a stern-wheeler, a type of steamboat which is now\r\nextensively used for navigating shallow rivers in the Southern States\r\nof America and in India. The steam tow-boat brought its inventor\r\nnothing but ridicule, and he died in London in almost destitute\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nNext in chronological sequence come the Abbé Arnal and the Marquis\r\nde Jouffroy, of France, who, in 1781, made experiments to show the\r\npracticability of applying steam power to vessels.\r\n\r\nTwo years later (1783), a Mr. Fitch tried a species of steam boiler\r\non board a small nine-ton vessel on the Delaware River in America,\r\npropelling the vessel by paddles. [6]“In 1787 he built another boat,\r\n45ft. by 12ft., and fitted her with a 12in. cylinder. With this\r\nvessel he is reported to have made the trip from Philadelphia to\r\nBurlington at an average rate of seven miles per hour. In 1790 he\r\ncompleted another and a larger boat.” But all his plans failed, and,\r\nlike Hulls, his contemporaries deemed him to be crazy. He died in\r\n1798.\r\n\r\n[7]About this period (1780 to 1788) there resided in Edinburgh a\r\nbanker, of aristocratic birth and connection. Patrick Miller, the\r\nbanker referred to, was a man of an active and ingenious mind,\r\nand, having realised a large fortune by banking, he used it as a\r\nmeans of enabling him to work out schemes for the benefit of the\r\npublic. Having purchased an estate in the beautiful valley of the\r\nNith, from which he derived the title of Laird of Dalswinton, he\r\nretired thither to solve the problem of navigating a vessel by\r\nsome more certain means than oars and sails. He had (prior to\r\nthis)[8]“exhibited a triple vessel at Leith, having rotatory paddles\r\nin the two interspaces, driven by a crank and wrought by four men. He\r\ndetermined one day to try its powers against a fast sailing Customs\r\nWherry, between Inch-colm and the harbour of Leith, a distance of\r\nsix or seven miles. He beat his opponent by several minutes, and was\r\nvery well satisfied with the result. His boys’ tutor, a Mr. Taylor,\r\nwho had taken his turn at the crank, and realised how violent was\r\nthe necessary exertion, was convinced that without a more staying\r\npower than manual labour the invention would prove practically\r\nuseless. He stated his objections to Mr. Miller, and they had\r\nfrequent discussions on the subject. At length, one day, Taylor said\r\n‘Mr. Miller, I can suggest no power equal to the steam engine, or\r\nso applicable to your purpose.’ The result of this suggestion was\r\nthat Mr. Miller decided to fit up a new double boat, which he had\r\nrecently placed on the lake at Dalswinton for the amusement of his\r\nfamily. Taylor made the necessary arrangements under the direction of\r\nan ingenious mechanic named William Symington. The engine was a very\r\nsmall one, having four-inch brass cylinders, made by George Watt,\r\nbrassfounder, Edinburgh. On the 14th October, 1788, several hundreds\r\nof people assembled on the banks of Dalswinton Loch to witness the\r\ntrial trip of the twin steamboat, which was entirely successful.\r\nMr. Miller was so pleased with the success of the experiment that\r\nhe resolved to repeat it on a larger scale. The following year he\r\nfitted a twin vessel 60 feet long, belonging to himself, with an\r\nengine of 18in. cylinders. This vessel steamed at the rate of seven\r\nmiles an hour on the Forth and Clyde Canal, in the presence of a vast\r\nmultitude of spectators. It had been Mr. Miller’s wish to try a third\r\nexperiment with a third vessel, in which he should venture out on to\r\nthe ocean, and attempt a passage from Leith to London. Unfortunately,\r\nhe became dissatisfied with Symington, and, being vexed at the\r\ncost of fitting up the second vessel, which was much greater than\r\nhe anticipated, as well as by a miscalculation, through which the\r\nmachinery was made too heavy for the hulls, he hesitated to make\r\nfurther trial.”\r\n\r\n“Taylor being poor, and a scholar, not a mechanician, could do\r\nnothing without Mr. Miller’s assistance. Symington was the only one\r\nof the three who persevered. He deserves credit for having done\r\nso, but not for the manner in which he did it, for without any\r\ncommunication with Messrs. Miller and Taylor, the true inventors, he\r\ntook out a patent for the construction of steamboats in 1801. Through\r\nthe interest of Lord Dundas, he was able, in 1803, to fit up a new\r\nsteamboat for the Forth and Clyde Canal Co., and this vessel, called\r\nthe CHARLOTTE DUNDAS, was tried in towing a couple of barges upon\r\nthe canal with entire success, except in one respect, which was that\r\nthe agitation of the water by the paddles was found to wash down the\r\nbanks in an alarming manner. For this reason the Canal Co. resolved\r\nto give up the project, and the vessel was, therefore, laid aside.\r\nIt lay on the bank at Lock 16 for many years, generally looked on,\r\nof course, as a monument of misdirected ingenuity, but, as we shall\r\npresently see, it did not lie there altogether in vain. Meantime\r\nSymington had been in communication with the Duke of Bridgewater,\r\nwith the object of introducing steam towage on the Bridgewater\r\nCanal, and had actually received a trial order, when, unfortunately,\r\nthe Duke died, and the project was closed. Here Symington vanishes\r\nlikewise from the active part of this history. Miller died in 1815, a\r\ncomparatively poor man, having exhausted his fortune by improvements\r\nand experiments. It has been stated by his son that he spent fully\r\n£30,000 in projects of a purely public nature. Taylor died in 1824,\r\nin straitened circumstances, leaving a widow and daughters, to whom\r\nthe Government granted a pension of £50 a year.”\r\n\r\n“The experiments at Carron, in 1789, had been witnessed by a young\r\nman named Henry Bell, a working mason originally, as it appears,\r\nafterwards a humble kind of engineer in Glasgow, and later an hotel\r\nproprietor at Helensburgh. Bell never lost sight of the idea, and\r\nwhen Symington ceased experimenting in 1803 he took up the project.\r\nAt the same time an ingenious American, named Fulton, comes into\r\nthe field. He, in company with Bell, visited the CHARLOTTE DUNDAS\r\nin 1803, and Bell gave to Fulton drawings of the machinery which\r\nhe (Bell) had obtained, partly from Mr. Miller and partly from\r\nSymington.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Small sailboat]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] “Chambers’ Journal.”\r\n\r\n[4] Hy.

She owes\r\nthis honourable position in the commercial world to the energy and\r\nperseverance of Robert Fulton, who in spite of ridicule and active\r\nopposition, and want of capital, succeeded in building, in 1807, a\r\npaddle steam-packet, which he named the CLERMONT. Shortly after her\r\ntrial trip, she was advertised to run from New York to Albany, and,\r\nas soon as she could be got ready, the CLERMONT sailed on her first\r\nvoyage up the Hudson.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter, written by an eyewitness on that\r\noccasion, tells how the people along the river were excited by the\r\npassage of the steam-boat on her voyage from New York to Albany:—\r\n\r\n  “It was in the early autumn of the year 1807 that a knot of\r\n  villagers was gathered on a high bluff, just opposite Poughkeepsie,\r\n  on the west bank of the Hudson, attracted by the appearance of\r\n  a strange-looking craft, which was slowly making its way up the\r\n  river. Some imagined it to be a sea-monster, whilst others did\r\n  not hesitate to express their belief that it was a sign of the\r\n  approaching judgment. What seemed strange in the vessel was the\r\n  substitution of a lofty and strange black smoke-pipe rising from\r\n  the deck, instead of the gracefully tapered masts that commonly\r\n  stood on the vessels navigating the stream, and, in place of\r\n  the spars and rigging, the curious play of the working beam and\r\n  piston, and the slow turning and splashing of the huge and naked\r\n  paddle-wheels, met his astonished gaze. The dense clouds of smoke,\r\n  as they rose wave upon wave, added still more to the wonder of the\r\n  rustics.\r\n\r\n  “This strange-looking craft was the CLERMONT on her trial trip to\r\n  Albany; and, of the little knot of villagers above mentioned, the\r\n  writer, then a boy in his eighth year, with his parents, formed a\r\n  part; and I well remember the scene, one so well-fitted to impress\r\n  a lasting picture upon the mind of a child accustomed to watch the\r\n  vessels that passed up and down the river.\r\n\r\n  “On her return trip, the curiosity she excited was scarcely less\r\n  intense—the whole country talked of nothing but the sea-monster,\r\n  belching forth fire and smoke. The fishermen became terrified and\r\n  rowed homeward, and they saw nothing but destruction devastating\r\n  their fishing grounds; whilst the wreaths of black vapours, and\r\n  rushing noise of the paddle-wheels, foaming with the stirred up\r\n  waters, produced great excitement amongst the boatmen, until it was\r\n  more intelligent than before; for the character of that curious\r\n  boat, and the nature of the enterprise she was pioneering had been\r\n  ascertained.”\r\n\r\nSeveral accidents occurred to the machinery of the CLERMONT during\r\nher first season, but none of them caused any loss of life. There\r\nwere, however, so many of these mishaps that the incredulous were\r\nencouraged in the belief that she was a failure. But the misfortunes\r\nof the boat were not limited to accidents to machinery and other\r\nlegitimate mishaps. They included wilful attempts at her destruction\r\non the part of those who felt that their business was about to be\r\ninjured by this new system of navigation. Vessels ran foul of her\r\nintentionally, and so determined were the sloop owners and others to\r\nrid themselves of this dangerous competitor, that it became necessary\r\nfor the Legislature to interfere. But in spite of all opposition,\r\nFulton forced his way onward and upwards. He replaced his first\r\nsteamer by a second and larger one, also named the CLERMONT, and, as\r\nthe passenger trade developed, other steamers were added to the line.\r\n\r\nAmerican capitalists in different parts of the United States followed\r\nhis example. Steamers were built so rapidly to ply on the American\r\nAtlantic Seaboard, and on the Mississippi and other rivers, that in\r\n1823 (that is sixteen years after the first passenger steamer in the\r\nworld was built) there were 300 steamers plying on American waters.\r\n\r\nThe St. Lawrence is the chief dividing line between the United States\r\nand Canada. It forms the great summer highway for the traffic of\r\nBritish North America. By it the commerce of Europe is brought into\r\nthe country, and on its bosom is borne outwards the wealth of the\r\nforests and the surplus agricultural produce of the Dominion.\r\n\r\nOn the Canadian side of this great river are situated the two\r\nimportant cities of Quebec and Montreal. Two years (1809) after the\r\nbuilding of Fulton’s CLERMONT, and three years before the first\r\nEuropean steamer began to ply on the River Clyde, the steamboat\r\nACCOMMODATION ran on the St. Lawrence, maintaining a passenger\r\nservice between Quebec and Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe following account of this vessel, and of her first voyage,\r\nappeared in the “Quebec Mercury” of that date:—\r\n\r\n  “On Saturday morning at eight o’clock arrived here from Montreal,\r\n  being her first trip, the steamboat ACCOMMODATION, with ten\r\n  passengers. This is the first vessel of the kind that ever appeared\r\n  in this harbour. She is continually crowded with visitants. She\r\n  left Montreal on Wednesday, at two o’clock, so that her passage was\r\n  sixty-six hours, thirty of which she was at anchor. She arrived at\r\n  Three Rivers in twenty-four hours. She has at present berths for\r\n  twenty passengers, which next year will be considerably augmented.\r\n  No wind or tide can stop her. She has 75 feet keel, and 85 on deck.\r\n  The price for a passage up is nine dollars, and eight down—the\r\n  vessel supplying provisions. The great advantage attending a vessel\r\n  so constructed is, that a passage may be calculated on to a degree\r\n  of certainty, in point of time, which cannot be the case with any\r\n  vessel propelled by sails only. The steamboat receives her impulse\r\n  from an open double-spoked, perpendicular wheel, on each side,\r\n  without any circular band or rim. To the end of each double spoke\r\n  is fixed a square board, which enters the water, and by the rotary\r\n  motion of the wheel, acts like a paddle. The wheels are put and\r\n  kept in motion by steam, operating within the vessel. A mast is to\r\n  be fixed in her for the purpose of using a sail when the wind is\r\n  favourable, which will occasionally accelerate her headway.”\r\n\r\nIn 1813 two new steamers were placed on the St. Lawrence, called\r\nrespectively the SWIFTSURE and the CAR OF COMMERCE, and, after a\r\nfurther interval of four years, a fourth steamer, the QUEBEC, began\r\nto ply between Quebec and Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe first of these steamers, the SWIFTSURE, was 140 feet over all,\r\nwith a beam of 24 feet. On her maiden voyage she made the passage\r\nfrom Montreal to Quebec in twenty-two and a half hours, in the face\r\nof a strong easterly wind all the way. Notwithstanding that she “beat\r\nthe most famous of the sailing packets on the line (fourteen hours in\r\na race of thirty-six hours), her owners do not seem to have been very\r\nconfident of her movements under all circumstances, or of the number\r\nof passengers who would patronise her, for she was advertised to sail\r\n‘as the wind and passengers may suit.’”[9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Terry Steamer St Lawrence]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Lindsay’s “Merchant Shipping,” folio 59.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSteamboats on the River Clyde, the COMET, INDUSTRY, ARGYLE.—On the\r\nThames, the MARGERY and the THAMES.—The first Irish Steamer, the CITY\r\nOF CORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout, in the slightest degree, detracting from the credit due to\r\nthe inventors referred to in the earlier pages of this history, it is\r\nindisputable that the River Clyde is the birthplace of European Steam\r\nNavigation.\r\n\r\nFor many years the CHARLOTTE DUNDAS (a success from an engineering\r\npoint of view, but a failure commercially), lay idle and corroding\r\nat Lock 16 on the Forth and Clyde Canal. She was regarded by the\r\nmajority of those who saw her there, as a monument of Symington’s\r\nfolly—the embodiment of a “fad.”\r\n\r\nBell, however, throughout these years, retained his faith in the\r\nultimate success of the Marine Steam Engine. There seemed to be no\r\nprobability of steam being utilized as a motive power for vessels\r\nin British waters, but the Americans were more enterprising, and\r\nFulton, who accompanied Bell to inspect the CHARLOTTE DUNDAS in 1803,\r\ngave the latter to understand that he had influential friends in\r\nAmerica, whom he could induce to build steamers. Bell had good reason\r\nto consider himself badly treated by Fulton in this matter, yet,\r\nundoubtedly, indirectly Bell was benefited by Fulton’s success. It\r\nis more than probable that during the five years that succeeded the\r\nbuilding of the CLERMONT, frequent reports regarding both this vessel\r\nand her successors in the United States and Canada, reached Scotland.\r\nAnd as a consequence of the success of these boats, Bell succeeded\r\nin getting a small steamer built to trade on the River Clyde. The\r\nfollowing is a copy of Mr. Bell’s advertisement of the sailing of his\r\nsteamer:—\r\n\r\n  “The COMET, between Glasgow, Greenock and Helensburgh, for\r\n  passengers only. The subscriber having at much expense, fitted up\r\n  a handsome vessel to ply upon the River Clyde, between Glasgow and\r\n  Greenock, to sail by the power of wind, air, and steam, he intends\r\n  that the vessel shall leave the Bromielaw on Tuesdays, Thursdays,\r\n  and Saturdays, about mid-day or such hour thereafter as may answer\r\n  from the state of the tide; and to leave Greenock on Mondays,\r\n  Wednesdays, and Fridays, in the morning to suit the tide. The terms\r\n  are fixed for the present at 4s. for the best cabin, and 3s. for\r\n  the second; but beyond these rates nothing is to be allowed to\r\n  servants or any other person employed about the vessel.”\r\n\r\nThe COMET was a steamer of 25 tons burden, 40 feet long, and 10 feet\r\n6 inches broad, and she steamed about 5 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the “Steamship” (1st January, 1883), relates\r\nregarding one Dougal Jamson, a Clyde skipper, of the time of the\r\nCOMET, that whenever the steamboat passed his slow going sloop, he\r\ninvariably piped all hands—a man and a boy—and bade them “Kneel down\r\nand thank God, that ye sail wi’ the Almichty’s ain win’, an’ no’ wi’\r\nthe deevil’s sunfire an’ brimstane, like that spluttery thing there.”\r\n\r\nThe following year there were three additional steamers constantly\r\nplying on the Clyde between Glasgow and Greenock. One of these was\r\nprobably the steamer (whose name has not been recorded), which came\r\nfrom the Clyde to Liverpool in 1815. The second of this trio was the\r\nINDUSTRY, whose remains were to be seen more than half a century\r\nlater at Bowling. And the third was the steamer ARGYLE, afterwards\r\nre-named the THAMES.\r\n\r\nAll these boats were faster than the COMET, and were twice as large,\r\nbeing 75 feet long and 14 feet broad. Against such competitors\r\nthe COMET could not compete successfully. In his later years Bell\r\nreceived a small annuity from the Clyde Trustees, who, after his\r\ndecease, erected an obelisk to his memory, which may still be seen\r\nstanding on a rock a little below Bowling.\r\n\r\nFor two or three summers Glasgow was the only City in Great Britain\r\nor Ireland whose citizens enjoyed the advantages of steam packet\r\ncommunication with the coast. But, in the summer of the year 1815,\r\nthe citizens of London and of Cork were given equal facilities.\r\n\r\nIreland has always occupied a most honourable position in the Annals\r\nof Steam Navigation. Cork had a steamship service certainly as early\r\nas Liverpool; the pioneer of the Liverpool coasting steamship trade\r\nwas a Belfast steamer; from Cork, sailed the first steamer with\r\npassengers from Europe to America; the first Trans-Atlantic Liner\r\nfrom Liverpool was a Dublin steamer; and in this year of grace 1903,\r\nthe steamers built in Belfast, which carry the White Star flag across\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, have a reputation unsurpassed by\r\nany steamships afloat. But Cork anticipated Belfast in shipbuilding\r\nand ship-owning. Messrs. Michael O’Brien and Christopher Owens, of\r\nCork, were the first to introduce steamers to the merchants and\r\ntravelling public of the South of Ireland. They built, in 1815, the\r\nriver steamer CITY OF CORK. She was a wooden paddle steamer of 50\r\ntons register; and of slightly larger dimensions than the Clyde-built\r\nsteamers referred to, being 86 feet long, 13 feet broad, and 9 feet\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nThe steam fleet of the Thames consisted at this date of the three\r\nsteam-packets MARJORY, DEFIANCE and THAMES, which steamers plied\r\nbetween London and Margate. The DEFIANCE, probably a locally built\r\nvessel, was commanded by William Robins, and sailed from near Summer\r\nQuay, Billingsgate, every Sunday and Wednesday morning, at 7 o’clock,\r\nreturning from Margate every Tuesday and Friday morning.\r\n\r\n“The THAMES, steam yacht,” (says the London “Times,” of the 8th\r\nJuly, 1815), “from London to Margate, starts from Wool Quay, near\r\nthe Custom House, Thames Street, every Tuesday and Saturday at 8\r\no’clock a.m., precisely, and leaves Margate on her return to London\r\nevery Monday and Thursday at the same hour. This rapid, capacious\r\nand splendid vessel lately accomplished a voyage of 1,500 miles, has\r\ntwice crossed St. George’s Channel, and came round the Land’s End\r\nwith a rapidity unknown before in naval history, and is the first\r\nsteam vessel that ever traversed those seas. She has the peculiar\r\nadvantage of proceeding either by sails or steam, separated or\r\nunited, by which means the public have the pleasing certainty of\r\nnever being detained on the water after dark, much less one or two\r\nnights, which has frequently occurred with the old packets. Against\r\nthe wind, the tide, or in the most perfect calm, the passage is alike\r\ncertain, and has always been achieved in one day. Her cabins are\r\nspacious, and are fitted up with all that elegance could suggest, or\r\npersonal comfort require; presenting a choice library, backgammon\r\nboards, draught tables, and other means of amusement. For the express\r\npurpose of combining delicacy with comfort a female servant attends\r\nupon the ladies. The fares (which include Pier Duty) are in the\r\nChief Cabin 15s., and in the Fore Cabin 11s., children half price.\r\nNo articles or goods will be taken, except the luggage accompanying\r\npassengers; and the proprietors will not be answerable for any of\r\nthe above, unless delivered into the care of the Steward, nor to the\r\namount of more than £5 value, except entered and paid for as such.”\r\n\r\nA narrative of the remarkable voyage of this steamer from the Clyde\r\nto the Thames, referred to in the above quotation from the “Times,”\r\nwill be found in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailboat near land]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n“The Year 1815.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the student of British history, the year 1815 is one of the most\r\nremarkable of the nineteenth century. In June of that year was fought\r\nthe Battle of Waterloo—a victory for the British which effectually\r\ndestroyed the power of the first Napoleon, and delivered Europe from\r\nthe terror of a military despotism. The merchants of the “good old\r\ntown” of Liverpool were determined that the famous victory should\r\nnever be forgotten by their descendants, and so they perpetuated\r\nthe name in the “Waterloo Road,” the “Waterloo Dock,” and their\r\nlatest seaside suburb “Waterloo.” Another event occurred in that\r\nsame eventful month of June, 1815, an event unheralded at the time,\r\nbut whose results have been more widely spread and more beneficent\r\nthan those which resulted from the Battle of Waterloo. This was the\r\narrival from the Clyde of the first steamer ever seen on the river\r\nMersey. The following brief and unsatisfactory paragraph appeared in\r\nthe “Liverpool Mercury” of the 30th June:—\r\n\r\n  “Liverpool Steamboat.—On Wednesday last, about noon, the public\r\n  curiosity was considerably excited by the arrival of the first\r\n  steamboat ever seen in our river. She came from the Clyde, and\r\n  in her passage called at Ramsay, in the Isle of Man, which place\r\n  she left early on the same morning. We believe she is intended to\r\n  ply between this port and Runcorn, or even occasionally as far as\r\n  Warrington. Her cabin will contain about one hundred passengers.”\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most tantalising paragraphs ever printed. If “the\r\npublic curiosity was considerably excited,” the reporter certainly\r\ntook no pains to gratify it. The name of the vessel is not given,\r\nnor any particulars of her dimensions, or of her power and speed. The\r\ndaring mariners who navigated her are nameless, and the incidents of\r\nthis pioneer voyage are left unrecorded.\r\n\r\n    “The evil that men do lives after them,\r\n     The good is oft interred with their bones.”\r\n\r\nFortunately we are able, from other sources, to gather some idea of\r\nthe size and appearance of the vessel, and of the impression she\r\nmade on the minds of the spectators. She was presumably one of the\r\nthree steamers built on the Clyde in 1813, as competitors against the\r\nCOMET, for passengers between Glasgow and Greenock; the other two\r\nwere the ARGYLE and the INDUSTRY. There was only a difference of five\r\nfeet between the smallest and the largest of these three steamers, so\r\nthat a description of the ARGYLE will answer for the others as well.\r\nThe ARGYLE was a packet steamer of 70 tons register, measuring in her\r\nkeel 79 feet, with 16 feet beam, paddle wheels 9 feet in diameter,\r\nand engines 14 h.p. Her smoke was carried off by a funnel, which also\r\ndid duty as a mast, being rigged with a large square sail. A gallery,\r\nupon which the cabin windows opened, projected so as to form a\r\ncontinuous deck, interrupted only by the paddle boxes, an arrangement\r\nwhich had the further effect of making the vessel appear larger than\r\nshe really was. On the outside of the gallery eighteen large port\r\nholes were painted, which, with the two she displayed upon her stern,\r\nmade the ARGYLE look so formidable to those to whom a steamer was a\r\nnovelty, that it was stated in a Committee of the House of Commons,\r\nby several naval officers, that if they had met her at sea they would\r\nhave endeavoured to reconnoitre before attempting to bring her to.\r\nAfter plying for twelve months between Glasgow and Greenock, the\r\nARGYLE was sold to a London firm, who changed her name to the THAMES.\r\nIn consequence of this change of ownership, this vessel made one of\r\nthe most remarkable voyages ever accomplished by any steamer. An\r\ninteresting narrative of the voyage, from which these particulars are\r\ntaken, was published in “Chambers’ Journal” on the 25th April, 1857.\r\n\r\nThe task of bringing the little steam-packet round by sea from the\r\nClyde to the Thames, was intrusted to an ex-naval officer named Dodd,\r\na man of considerable and diverse abilities. He projected the Thames\r\ntunnel, proposing to carry it across from Gravesend to Tilbury, at\r\nan estimated cost of under £16,000. According to an account of the\r\nvoyage which Dodd himself published in the “Morning Chronicle” of\r\nthe 15th June, 1815, and afterwards embodied in his evidence before\r\na Committee of the House of Commons, Dodd sailed from Glasgow about\r\nthe middle of May with a crew of eight persons—a mate, an engineer,\r\na stoker, four seamen, and a cabin-boy. His voyage at first was far\r\nfrom auspicious. The weather was stormy, the sea ran high in the\r\nstrait which separates Scotland from Ireland, and either through\r\nignorance or negligence, the pilot during the night altered the\r\ncourse of the vessel, so that it ran a great risk of being wrecked.\r\nDodd had given orders that the steamer should be steered so as to\r\ngain the Irish coast by the morning; but at break of day a heavy\r\ngale was blowing, and it was discovered that, instead of being off\r\nthe coast of Ireland, they were within half-a-league off a lee\r\nshore, rock bound, about two miles to the north of Port Patrick.\r\nRelying entirely upon the efficiency of his engine, Dodd at once\r\nlaid the vessel’s head directly to windward, and ordered the log\r\nto be kept constantly going. The plan succeeded. The THAMES began\r\nslowly to clear the shore, going direct in the wind’s eye at the\r\nrate of something more than three knots an hour. On the 24th of May\r\nthe voyagers arrived safely at Dublin, where they were joined by a\r\nMr. Weld and his wife. Mrs. Weld has the proud distinction of having\r\nbeen the first lady passenger to cross the St. George’s Channel on a\r\nsteamboat. Mr. Weld kept a journal, from which the following is an\r\nextract:—\r\n\r\n  [10]“On the 25th May, 1815, I heard by accident that a steam-vessel\r\n  had arrived at Dublin. I immediately went to see her, and found her\r\n  on the point of starting with a number of curious visitors upon an\r\n  experimental trip in the bay. I was so much pleased with all that\r\n  I saw and heard concerning her, that, having previously intended\r\n  to proceed to London, I determined to request Captain Dodd to\r\n  receive me as a passenger, and to be permitted to accompany him\r\n  throughout the voyage. He at once consented, and my wife having\r\n  resolved on sharing the dangers of the voyage with me, we proceeded\r\n  to make the necessary arrangements for our departure. On the 28th\r\n  of May, being Sunday, we left the Liffey at noon. Many persons\r\n  embarked with us from curiosity, but only to cross the bay as far\r\n  as Dunleary (now Kingstown), where they landed. Unfortunately, the\r\n  sea was very rough, which occasioned the most violent sea-sickness\r\n  amongst the passengers. Several naval officers were on board, who\r\n  were unanimous in declaring it to be their firm opinion that the\r\n  vessel could not live long in heavy seas, and that there would\r\n  be much danger in venturing far from shore. I deemed it right to\r\n  inform my wife of this opinion, but, although she suffered greatly\r\n  from sea-sickness, she persisted in her intention of accompanying\r\n  me, and that evening, after having passed some hours on land\r\n  at the house of a friend, the vessel put to sea, we being the\r\n  only passengers. The shore was covered with several thousands of\r\n  spectators, who cheered and wished us a prosperous voyage.\r\n\r\n  “The sea was comparatively calm as the vessel steamed into the\r\n  Bay of Dalkey, and the passengers calculated on a pleasant voyage\r\n  during the night, but, when beyond the shelter of the coast, they\r\n  found it to be as rough as ever. The THAMES again proved her\r\n  admirable sea-going qualities, bounding so lightly over the waves\r\n  that her passengers were not once wetted, even by the spray.”\r\n\r\nShe soon left behind her all the vessels which had sailed from Dublin\r\nwith the same tide, and about nine o’clock next morning arrived\r\noff Wexford. The dense smoke which issued from its mast chimney\r\nbeing observed from the heights above the town, it was concluded\r\nthat the vessel was on fire. All the pilots immediately put off to\r\nits assistance; and nothing could exceed their surprise, mingled\r\nwith disappointment, when they saw that the ship was in no danger\r\nwhatever, and that their hopes of salvage were at an end.\r\n\r\nThe weather had now become so stormy, that Captain Dodd determined to\r\nput into port, his great object being to navigate the vessel safely\r\nto London, rather than, by using great dispatch, to expose her to\r\nunnecessary risk.\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock on Tuesday morning, 30th May, Dodd left Wexford and\r\nsailed for St. David’s Head, the most westerly point of Wales.\r\nDuring the passage across St. George’s Channel one of the blades of\r\nthe starboard paddle wheel got out of order. The engine was stopped\r\nand the blade cut away. Some hours after a similar accident befell\r\nthe port wheel, which was remedied in the same manner. The loss of\r\none blade in each wheel made no apparent difference in the speed\r\nof the vessel. Fortunately when the accidents occurred the sea was\r\nvery calm. After a voyage of twelve hours duration, the steamer\r\narrived at the Pass of Ramsay, between the island of that name and\r\nSt. David’s Head. There the adventurers remained for three hours\r\nto oil the engine, and to give the stoker, who had not quitted his\r\npost for an instant since leaving Wexford, a little rest. There,\r\ntoo, as at Wexford, boats put out from different parts of the coast\r\nto the assistance of the vessel, which they believed to be on fire.\r\nLeaving Ramsay, the THAMES steamed through the straits and across St.\r\nBride’s Bay. The weather had again become unfavourable, and a heavy\r\nsea had arisen in the bay. So high indeed were the waves, that, when\r\ningulphed between them, the coast, though lofty, could not be seen;\r\nbut the little craft held her way most gallantly over all.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of St. Bride’s Bay, between Skomar Island and the\r\nmainland, there is a dangerous passage called Jack Sound. The pilot\r\nwarned the captain against attempting this passage, except under\r\nfavourable conditions as to wind and water, but Dodd, who knew the\r\npower of his engine, insisted on going through the sound, in order\r\nto save five hours, and to avoid another night at sea. The dangerous\r\nsound was safely navigated, and the voyagers reached Milford Haven.\r\nAs they were steaming up the harbour, they met the Government mail\r\npacket proceeding from Milford to Waterford, with all her sails\r\nspread. They had passed her about a quarter of a mile, when Captain\r\nDodd determined to send some letters by her to Ireland. The THAMES\r\nwas immediately put about, and in a few minutes she was alongside\r\nthe packet ship, and sailed round her, although the latter continued\r\nunder way. The captain and passengers wrote a few letters, put them\r\non board the packet, sailed round her once more, and then continued\r\ntheir course to Milford.\r\n\r\nThe two following days were spent in satisfying the curiosity of\r\nnumerous naval officers who were anxious to see the THAMES, and to\r\nexamine her engine, as well as to test her sailing powers. It became\r\nnecessary also to clean out the boiler, which had not been done since\r\nleaving Glasgow. Late on the evening of the 31st May, she sailed\r\nin company with the MYRTLE, sloop-of-war, whose captain (Bingham)\r\nand a company of ladies were aboard the steamer, anxious to see how\r\nshe would behave in a rough sea. The MYRTLE was obliged to hoist\r\nroyals and studding sails to keep up with the THAMES, and at last by\r\ncrowding all sail, she got a little ahead. But the great superiority\r\nof steam was yet to be shown. Dodd gallantly determined to carry the\r\nladies back to Milford, instead of transferring them to the MYRTLE\r\nin an open boat. Accordingly he steamed back to Milford, leaving\r\nthe sloop of war far behind, and when he was again outward bound,\r\nhe found the sloop had anchored, being unable owing to the failure\r\nof the wind to regain her former station. Next morning (Friday) the\r\nvoyagers found themselves mid-way across the Bristol Channel, with no\r\nland visible on either side, but towards evening the Cornish coast\r\nwas sighted. The weather, however, had again become threatening, and\r\nthe pilot did not consider it would be prudent to attempt to round\r\nthe Land’s End that night, and Dodd accordingly decided to put into\r\nSt. Ives. As the THAMES approached the shore, a fleet of small craft\r\nwas seen making towards her, with all possible speed by means of\r\nsails and oars, in the belief (as at Wexford) that the THAMES was a\r\nship on fire making for the port. When they discovered their mistake\r\nthey tacked about and endeavoured to out-sail each other. All the\r\nrocks from which a view of St. Ives could be obtained were crowded\r\nwith spectators, to whom the appearance of the THAMES created as\r\nmuch surprise as the ships of Captain Cook produced amongst the\r\nislanders of the South Sea. The harbour of St. Ives affording no\r\nshelter from gales from the North East, Dodd took his vessel to the\r\nsheltered port of Hayle, four miles distant, where she lay in perfect\r\nsafety. It had been represented to Mr. and Mrs. Weld that rounding\r\nthe Land’s End was the most difficult and dangerous part of the\r\nvoyage, and they had in consequence crossed the neck of land to the\r\nSouth coast with the intention of remaining there until the steamer\r\narrived. On further consideration, however, they resolved, instead\r\nof waiting for the THAMES, to return to Hayle, and to brave with the\r\nsteamer’s crew the dangers of doubling the Land’s End. The weather\r\nhaving moderated they re-embarked at 4 o’clock on Monday afternoon,\r\n5th June, and the steamer at once proceeded on her voyage.\r\n\r\nAs the little vessel rounded Cornwall Head, the more northerly of\r\nthe two great promontories which terminate England on the west, a\r\ntremendous swell from the Atlantic met her, whilst the tide, which\r\nran strongly down St. George’s Channel, combining with the swell,\r\nraised the waves to such a height as to render her position in the\r\nhighest degree alarming. Dodd would not put back, and after a night\r\nof severe struggle, the adventurers succeeded in rounding the Land’s\r\nEnd, and found themselves in a comparatively tranquil sea. Next day\r\nthe sun shone with great brilliance, and revealed the beauties of\r\nthe South Coast as they steamed along it towards Plymouth, which\r\nthey reached at eleven o’clock in the morning. As the THAMES passed\r\nthe various ships at anchor, the sailors on board ran in crowds to\r\nthe sides of their vessels or climbed the rigging for a better view.\r\nThe harbour-master, who had never seen a steam vessel before, was\r\nas much excited when he boarded the THAMES as a child is in getting\r\npossession of a new plaything.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the following day (Wednesday) was occupied in showing\r\nthe capabilities of the steamer to the Port-Admiral and to the naval\r\nofficers who went on board.\r\n\r\nThe THAMES left Plymouth at noon on Thursday for Portsmouth, where\r\nshe arrived at 11 o’clock on Friday morning, having steamed 155 miles\r\nin twenty-three hours. At Portsmouth she created a greater sensation\r\nthan at any of the ports she had visited. Tens of thousands of\r\nspectators assembled to gaze at her; and the number of vessels that\r\ncrowded around her was so great, that it became necessary to request\r\nthe Port-Admiral to assign the voyagers a guard, in order to preserve\r\nsome degree of order. The THAMES steamed into the harbour in the most\r\nbrilliant style, travelling with the aid of wind and tide at the rate\r\nof between twelve and fourteen knots an hour. A court-martial was\r\nsitting at the time on board the GLADIATOR frigate, but the novelty\r\nof the steam-boat presented an irresistible attraction, and the\r\nwhole court went off to her (except the president). At an early hour\r\nnext morning (Saturday), the Port-Admiral, Sir Edward Thornborough,\r\nsent his band and a guard of marines on board, and soon afterwards\r\nfollowed in person, accompanied by three admirals, eighteen\r\npost-captains, and a large number of ladies. The morning was spent\r\nvery pleasantly in steaming amongst the fleet, and running over to\r\nthe Isle of Wight. The Admiral, and all the naval officers, expressed\r\nthemselves delighted with the THAMES.\r\n\r\nFrom Portsmouth the steamer proceeded to Margate, which was reached\r\non Sunday morning. She remained at Margate until the following day,\r\nwhen she started on the final portion of her voyage at half-past\r\neight in the morning, and reached her destination (Limehouse), about\r\nsix o’clock the same evening, having accomplished the ninety miles\r\nrun from Margate in about nine hours. The THAMES carried fifteen\r\ntons of coal, her consumption being, on the average, a ton for every\r\nhundred miles. So ended this memorable voyage, practically the first\r\never attempted by a steamboat on the open sea.\r\n\r\nDodd’s after career was a most melancholy one. Talented, enterprising\r\nand courageous though he undoubtedly was, yet he never succeeded in\r\nhis enterprises. And in his later years, instead of seeking that\r\ndivine help which would have enabled him to meet his disappointments\r\nwith fortitude, he sought to forget them in intemperance, and almost\r\nliterally died a beggar in the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] “Chambers’ Journal,” 25th April, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\n  1816 to 1818.—Rivals to the THAMES, the DEFIANCE (1815),\r\n  MAJESTIC and REGENT (1816).—Loss of the REGENT (1817).—Liverpool\r\n  Steam-boats: the RUNCORN PACKET, the PRINCESS CHARLOTTE, Liverpool\r\n  to Eastham (1816).

The THAMES, after being refitted, opened the service in\r\nJuly, 1815. She had a monopoly of the station for about three months,\r\nwhen the DEFIANCE was put on in opposition. The following year saw\r\nthe MAJESTIC placed on the River Thames, and this vessel was probably\r\nthe first steamer employed in towing ships. She towed, on Wednesday,\r\n28th August, 1816, the large Indiaman, the HOPE, from Deptford to\r\nWoolwich at the rate of three miles per hour against the wind.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th June of the same year, a new steamboat, named the REGENT,\r\nwas tried on the Thames. She was built under the supervision of\r\nthe eminent engineer Brunel, by Maudsley (founder of the famous\r\nengineering firm of Maudsley and Field). Her burden was 112 tons, and\r\nshe was propelled by engines of 24 horse power. On her trial trip she\r\nsteamed from Blackfriars Bridge to Battersea Bridge in 30 minutes,\r\nand back through London Bridge in 52 minutes. Her machinery was\r\nremarkably light. Her engines, paddle-wheels, and all connections\r\nnecessary to give and convey the motive power, weighing only five\r\ntons. The REGENT had a very short existence. On the 2nd July, 1817,\r\nshe left London for Margate, with between 40 and 50 passengers on\r\nboard. Although it was blowing a gale, all went well until the vessel\r\narrived off Whitstable, about 18 miles from Margate. The REGENT was\r\nkeeping well out in mid-channel, and was about three miles from land,\r\nwhen she was discovered to be on fire amidships. The force of the\r\nwind had carried away the funnel, and the wood-work at the bottom\r\nof the funnel (nearly breast high from the deck for the protection\r\nof the passengers), caught fire. The vessel’s life-saving equipment\r\nconsisted of one small boat, barely sufficient to accommodate her\r\ncrew; and the only available means of extinguishing the fire was by\r\nhand buckets, dipped overside. To add to the alarm of the passengers,\r\nthe buckets one after the other were either broken against the\r\nside of the steamer, or carried away by the turbulent waves. The\r\npassengers bore themselves bravely, as Britons should in the face of\r\ndanger, and did not give way to panic. Perfect discipline appears\r\nto have been maintained amongst the crew. Seeing that he had no\r\nmeans of keeping the fire under, the Captain collected all the\r\npassengers forward and headed the REGENT for the nearest shore with\r\nthe intention of beaching her. This he succeeded in doing without\r\nthe loss of a single life, but the vessel herself was almost totally\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nOn the Mersey, also, progress had been made since the arrival of the\r\nfirst steamer, the PACKET, to and from Runcorn.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1816, the steam-packet PRINCESS CHARLOTTE commenced the\r\nLiverpool and Eastham service, and continued to sail twice each way\r\ndaily. The fare charged to Eastham and back was 1s. At Eastham the\r\nsteamer connected with coaches to and from Chester, Shrewsbury,\r\nHolyhead, and many other places.\r\n\r\nThe Liverpool and Tranmere Steam Ferry was opened by the steam-packet\r\n“Etna” sailing from the West-side Queen’s Dock. She was shortly\r\nafterwards opposed by the steam-packet REGULATOR, running in\r\nconnection with coaches from Tranmere to Parkgate, thence by\r\nsteam-packet ANCIENT BRITON to Bagillt, North Wales. During a\r\ngale on Monday, 12th January, 1818, the REGULATOR was sunk near the\r\nLiverpool Pierhead, but all on board were rescued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERNATIONAL CODE FLAGS.\r\n\r\n  Answering Pennant.\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  B\r\n  Powder Flag.\r\n\r\n  C\r\n  Assent—Yes.\r\n\r\n  D\r\n  Negative—No.\r\n\r\n  E\r\n\r\n  F\r\n\r\n  G\r\n\r\n  H\r\n\r\n  I\r\n\r\n  J\r\n\r\n  K\r\n\r\n  L\r\n  Cholera, Yellow Fever, or Plague Flag.\r\n\r\n  N\r\n\r\n  O\r\n\r\n  P\r\n  Blue Peter.—About to proceed to Sea.\r\n\r\n  Q\r\n  Quarantine Flag.\r\n\r\n  R\r\n\r\n  S\r\n  I require a Pilot.\r\n\r\n  T\r\n\r\n  U\r\n\r\n  V\r\n\r\n  W\r\n\r\n  X\r\n\r\n  Y\r\n\r\n  Z\r\n] [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AFRICAN S.

And, about the same\r\ndate, Mr. Wesewelodsky, a man of great wealth, and owner of several\r\nrich mines in Siberia, built two steamers for navigating the River\r\nKama. These vessels were 51 feet and 100 feet long, respectively. Mr.\r\nWesewelodsky travelled with his steamers from his mines to Casan, a\r\ndistance of 1,000 versts, and accomplished the voyage in 105 hours.\r\n\r\n  [11]“England owes to David Napier the establishment of deep-sea\r\n  communication by steam-vessels, and of Post Office steam-packets.\r\n  As a first step, he endeavoured to ascertain the difficulties\r\n  to be encountered. For this purpose he took passage at a stormy\r\n  period of the year on a sailing packet, which formed one of a line,\r\n  and the only means of intercourse between Glasgow and Belfast; a\r\n  passage which often required seven days to accomplish what is now\r\n  done by steam in as many hours. The captain of the packet found\r\n  a young man, whom he afterwards knew as Mr. Napier, during one\r\n  of his winter passages to Belfast, constantly perched on the bow\r\n  of the vessel, fixing an intent gaze on the sea when it broke on\r\n  the side of the ship, quite heedless of the waves and spray that\r\n  washed over him. He only ceased from this occupation at intervals,\r\n  as the breeze freshened, to ask the captain whether the sea was\r\n  such that it might be considered a rough one, and, when told that\r\n  it was by no means unusually rough, he returned to the bow of the\r\n  vessel and resumed his study of the waves breaking at her stem.\r\n  When the breeze began to freshen into a gale, and the sea to rise\r\n  considerably, he again enquired of the captain whether the sea\r\n  might now be considered a rough one, and was told that as yet it\r\n  could not be called very rough. Disappointed, he returned again to\r\n  his station at the bow, and resumed his employment. At last he\r\n  was favoured with a storm to his contentment, and when the seas,\r\n  breaking over the vessel, swept her from stem to stern, he found\r\n  his way back to the captain and repeated his enquiry, ‘Do you call\r\n  it rough now?’ The captain replied he could not remember having\r\n  faced a worse night in the whole of his experience, a reply which\r\n  delighted young Napier, who muttering, as he turned away, ‘I think\r\n  I can manage if that is all,’ went down to his cabin. Napier saw\r\n  then the end of his difficulties, and soon satisfied himself as to\r\n  the means of overcoming them. His next enquiry was as to the means\r\n  of getting through the water with least resistance. To determine\r\n  this, he commenced a series of experiments with models of vessels\r\n  in a small tank of water, and soon found that the round full bluff\r\n  bow adopted for sailing vessels was quite unsuited for speed with\r\n  mechanical propulsion of a different nature. This led him to adopt\r\n  the fine wedge-like bows by which the vessels built under his\r\n  superintendence were afterwards so distinguished.”\r\n\r\nNapier established regular steam-packet communication between\r\nGreenock and Belfast by means of the ROB ROY, a vessel of 90 tons\r\nburden and 30 horse power. After plying for two years between these\r\nports with great regularity and success, the ROB ROY was transferred\r\nto the English Channel as a packet between Dover and Calais.\r\nCross-channel steamboats between England and Ireland were first\r\nintroduced in 1816, when the steam-packet HIBERNIA was built by a\r\ncompany to carry passengers between Holyhead and Howth. The HIBERNIA\r\nwas 112 tons burden, 77 feet keel measurement, and 9 feet draft. She\r\nwas lugger rigged, and capable of making the passage by sails only.\r\nHer average passage, Holyhead to Howth, was about seven hours, and\r\nher passengers frequently had the satisfaction of arriving in Dublin\r\nconsiderably in advance of the Mail packets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paddlewheeler ship]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] “History of Steam Navigation,” Adm. Prebble, U.S.N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\n  Early Clyde Steam-packets.—Season Tickets issued, 1816.—First\r\n  steamer to cross the English Channel.—DUMBARTON CASTLE steams\r\n  round North of Scotland, 1819.—First serious Accident to a\r\n  Steam-packet.—Clyde Passenger Fares, 1818.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany circumstances combined to make the Clyde the birthplace and\r\nthe home of the Marine Steam Engine. Coal and iron mines were in\r\nclose proximity, and skilled labour for the construction of engines\r\nand of ships was abundant. The beautiful Firth, with its numerous\r\nlochs and islands, constituted an ideal locality for the employment\r\nof steamboats while yet the art of steamship building was in its\r\ninfancy. And on the shores of the River, or within easy distance of\r\nit, dwelt a large industrial population, eager to take advantage of\r\nthe facilities for travel which steamboats afforded.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is not surprising that steam-packets\r\non the Clyde increased with marvellous rapidity. In 1812 the COMET\r\nfirst began to ply between Glasgow, Greenock and Helensburgh, and\r\nshe was, in fact, the only steamboat then sailing on British waters.\r\nThree years later (in 1815) a fleet of seven steamers, viz., the\r\nGLASGOW, BRITANNIA, DUMBARTON CASTLE, CALEDONIA, ARGYLE, PRINCE OF\r\nORANGE, and PRINCESS CHARLOTTE, sailed regularly from Glasgow to\r\nLargs, Ardrossan, Troon and Ayr, southwards; and Rothesay, Tarbert,\r\nLochgilphead and Inverary, westwards. No agents’ names are given\r\nin any of the press advertisements of this or previous years, but\r\nthe sailings were advertised on boards placed outside the agent’s\r\ncounting houses, and exhibited in taverns and other places of public\r\nresort. In 1816 and subsequent years the owners’ or agents’ names are\r\nappended to the press notices of the various steam-packets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Early type of African Coasting Steamer.]\r\n\r\nIn May of the year named, the steamboats BRITANNIA and (new) WATERLOO\r\nwere advertised to sail between Glasgow and all the watering places\r\non both sides of the Clyde.\r\n\r\n  “Families wishing to agree for the season may know particulars\r\n  by applying to Mr. Lewis MacLellan, Gallowgate, Mr. Wm. Smith,\r\n  Bromielaw, and the Masters on board.”\r\n\r\nThese small steamers were the pioneers of the magnificent fleet of\r\nChannel steamships, sailing from Glasgow, and known as the “Laird\r\nLine.” A grandson of the Mr. Lewis MacLellan here referred to, and a\r\nnephew, are still (1903) connected with the Company as directors. The\r\nsteamer ALBION was advertised in the same paper in similar terms, and\r\non the 9th July following the agents of nine steam-packets sailing\r\nfrom Glasgow, gave notice that the issue of season tickets was\r\ndiscontinued for the remainder of the season.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that the issue of season contract tickets, popularly\r\nsupposed to be a modern institution of the railway companies, is\r\nfound to be a common practice amongst the steamship owners of Glasgow\r\nmore than three-quarters of a century ago.\r\n\r\nMr. W. S. Lindsay, in his admirable book “The History of Merchant\r\nShipping from 1816 to 1874,” quotes Mr. Muirhead’s “Life of Watt,”\r\nas stating that “In April, 1817, Mr. James Watt, Jun., purchased the\r\nCALEDONIA, and having re-fitted her, took her in October to Holland\r\nand up the Rhine to Coblentz; having thus been the first to cross the\r\nEnglish Channel in a steamboat. The average speed he obtained was\r\nseven and a half knots an hour.”\r\n\r\nEither Mr. Muirhead was in error in the dates given, or he was wrong\r\nin assuming that the CALEDONIA was the first steamer to cross the\r\nEnglish Channel. A correspondent of the “Glasgow Chronicle,” in a\r\nletter to that Journal, dated Cologne, 16th June, 1816 (_i.e._,\r\nsixteen months prior to the date mentioned by Mr. Muirhead as the\r\ndate on which the CALEDONIA crossed the Channel), says:—\r\n\r\n  “To-day, about noon, we enjoyed a sight equally novel and\r\n  entertaining, a pretty large vessel without a mast ascending the\r\n  Rhine, and proceeding with astonishing rapidity, arrive before this\r\n  city. All the vessels stationed on the Rhine in this neighbourhood\r\n  were in a moment covered with spectators, to see the arrival of\r\n  this vessel, which is a steamboat coming from London, and bound for\r\n  Frankfort. Everybody was eager to view the progress, the motion,\r\n  the organisation of this masterpiece of art. The vessel left\r\n  Rotterdam on the 6th inst. The passengers affirm that it can go 25\r\n  leagues in a day.”\r\n\r\nThe DUMBARTON CASTLE (Captain Thomson) was advertised to take\r\npassengers for a trip from Glasgow round Ailsa Craig on the 7th\r\nAugust, 1816. She was the first British steamboat (the THAMES\r\nexcepted) to take passengers on a deep sea trip, and she was also the\r\nfirst steamer to sail round the North of Scotland, which she did in\r\n1819, in consequence of being sold for employment between Leith and\r\nGrangemouth.\r\n\r\nThe first serious accident to a Clyde steamboat of which there is\r\nany record, occurred in the early part of the year 1816. The new\r\nsteam-packet ROTHESAY CASTLE, while entering the harbour of Tarbert\r\non her return voyage from Inverary, struck on a reef of sunken\r\nrocks. All her passengers were rescued by fishing boats, which also\r\nlanded the luggage. One of the fishing boats was also despatched to\r\nrequest the Master of the ARGYLE (which was to leave Inverary four\r\nhours later than the ROTHESAY CASTLE) to call at Tarbert. This was\r\naccordingly done and the shipwrecked passengers were taken on to\r\nRothesay and Greenock the same evening. The steamer was subsequently\r\ngot off the rocks and taken to Port Glasgow for repairs.\r\n\r\nIt may interest citizens of Glasgow and dwellers on the coast to\r\ncompare, by means of the following table, the steamship Passenger\r\nFares of 1818 with those of the present day.\r\n\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n                          |           |  Port     |\r\n              To Renfrew. | Dunglass. |Glasgow or | Gonrock.\r\n                          |           | Greenock. |\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n              |     |  S  |     |  S  |     |  S  |     |  S\r\n              |     |  t  |     |  t  |     |  t  |     |  t\r\n              |     |  e  |     |  e  |     |  e  |     |  e\r\n  From.       |  C  |  e  |  C  |  e  |  C  |  e  |  C  |  e\r\n              |  a  |  r  |  a  |  r  |  a  |  r  |  a  |  r\r\n              |  b  |  a  |  b  |  a  |  b  |  a  |  b  |  a\r\n              |  i  |  g  |  i  |  g  |  i  |  g  |  i  |  g\r\n              |  n  |  e  |  n  |  e  |  n  |  e  |  n  |  e\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n              |s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.\r\n  Glasgow     | 1 0 | 1 0 | 2 0 | 1 6 | 4 0 | 2 6 | 4 0 | 3 0\r\n  Greenock    | 3 0 | 2 0 | 2 0 | 1 6 |     |     | 1 0 | 0 6\r\n  Largs       | 6 6 | 4 0 | 5 6 | 3 6 | 3 6 | 2 6 | 3 0 | 2 0\r\n  Ardrossan   | 9 0 | 6 6 | 8 0 | 6 0 | 6 0 | 5 0 | 5 6 | 4 6\r\n  Rothesay    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n                          |           |           |\r\n             To Rothesay. |  Largs.   | Millport. |Ardrossan.\r\n                          |           |           |\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n              |     |  S  |     |  S  |     |  S  |     |  S\r\n              |     |  t  |     |  t  |     |  t  |     |  t\r\n              |     |  e  |     |  e  |     |  e  |     |  e\r\n     From.    |  C  |  e  |  C  |  e  |  C  |  e  |  C  |  e\r\n              |  a  |  r  |  a  |  r  |  a  |  r  |  a  |  r\r\n              |  b  |  a  |  b  |  a  |  b  |  a  |  b  |  a\r\n              |  i  |  g  |  i  |  g  |  i  |  g  |  i  |  g\r\n              |  n  |  e  |  n  |  e  |  n  |  e  |  n  |  e\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n              |s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.\r\n  Glasgow     | 7 6 | 5 0 | 7 6 | 5 0 | 8 6 | 6 0 |10 0 | 7 6\r\n  Greenock    | 3 6 | 2 6 | 3 6 | 2 6 | 4 6 | 3 6 | 6 0 | 5 0\r\n  Largs       | 1 6 | 1 0 |     |     | 1 0 | 1 0 | 2 6 | 2 0\r\n  Ardrossan   |     |     | 2 6 | 2 0 | 1 6 | 1 0 |     |\r\n  Rothesay    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n                          |           |           |Campbelton\r\n                To Troon. |    Ayr.   |Helensburg.|    or\r\n                          |           |           | Inverary.\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n              |     |  S  |     |  S  |     |  S  |     |  S\r\n              |     |  t  |     |  t  |     |  t  |     |  t\r\n              |     |  e  |     |  e  |     |  e  |     |  e\r\n     From.    |  C  |  e  |  C  |  e  |  C  |  e  |  C  |  e\r\n              |  a  |  r  |  a  |  r  |  a  |  r  |  a  |  r\r\n              |  b  |  a  |  b  |  a  |  b  |  a  |  b  |  a\r\n              |  i  |  g  |  i  |  g  |  i  |  g  |  i  |  g\r\n              |  n  |  e  |  n  |  e  |  n  |  e  |  n  |  e\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n              |s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.|s. d.\r\n  Glasgow     |11 0 | 8 0 |12 0 | 9 6 | 4 6 | 3 0 |12 0 | 8 6\r\n  Greenock    | 7 0 | 6 0 | 8 0 | 6 6 | 1 0 | 1 0 | 9 0 | 6 6\r\n  Largs       | 3 6 | 2 6 | 4 6 | 3 6 |     |     |     |\r\n  Ardrossan   | 1 6 | 1 0 | 2 6 | 2 0 |     |     |     |\r\n  Rothesay    |     |     |     |     |     |     | 7 6 | 5 0\r\n  ————————————————————————+———————————+———————————+———————————\r\n\r\n  Young persons 8 to 14 years of age—half-price.

No finer vessels crossed the\r\nAtlantic than the celebrated New York Packet Liners. It cannot be\r\nsupposed that a people so enterprising as the Americans would make no\r\nattempt at ocean steam navigation. On the contrary, as they were the\r\nfirst to build a coasting passenger steamer, so were they the first\r\nto build a steamer to cross the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the year 1818, and the beginning of 1819,\r\nthere was, in process of building at New York, a beautiful little\r\nship of about 320 tons burden. Whilst on the stocks it was suggested\r\nto convert her into a steamer, which was accordingly done. After she\r\nwas launched, the SAVANNAH, that being the name given to her, sailed\r\nfrom New York to Savannah, and thence, about the 25th May, 1819, she\r\nsailed to Liverpool, en route to St. Petersburg. It was reported at\r\nthe time that she was a present from the Americans to the Emperor\r\nof Russia. Although she did not steam the whole of the voyage from\r\nSavannah to Liverpool, which occupied twenty-six days, she was the\r\nfirst steamer that ever attempted to cross the Atlantic. British and\r\nCanadian authors have contended that she was not entitled to this\r\nhonour, as her steam power was merely auxiliary, but the contention\r\nis somewhat ungenerous, and, if allowed, would debar later vessels,\r\nnotably the SARAH SANDS and the GREAT BRITAIN, from claiming the\r\ntitle of steamships. The SAVANNAH reached Liverpool on Sunday, 20th\r\nJune, 1819, after a voyage of twenty-six days duration. Shortly after\r\nleaving Savannah it began to blow hard, and the following entry\r\nappears in the Captain’s log book:\r\n\r\n  “Stopped the engines, and brought the paddle-wheels in-board in\r\n  thirty minutes.”\r\n\r\nWhen off the Irish coast, the coastguard, seeing a huge volume of\r\nsmoke proceeding from a ship at sea, reported it to be a vessel on\r\nfire. A Government cutter from Cork put out to render assistance,\r\nand were much surprised on boarding her to learn that she required\r\nno assistance, except a Channel pilot, and that she had come from\r\nAmerica. Her arrival at Liverpool was witnessed by great crowds of\r\npeople, who had assembled to watch her entering the Mersey. After her\r\nvisit to St. Petersburg she re-crossed the Atlantic, her engines were\r\ntaken out of her, and, as a sailing packet, she traded between New\r\nYork and Savannah, until she was wrecked off Long Island.\r\n\r\nA month later, or to be exact, on the 22nd July, 1819, the first\r\ncross-channel steamer that ever entered the port, arrived at\r\nLiverpool from Belfast, after a passage of twenty-four hours. This\r\nsteamer was the WATERLOO, owned by Messrs. Langtry, of Belfast,\r\nwho were also the owners of a fleet of smacks which traded\r\nregularly between the two ports. The WATERLOO was a schooner-rigged\r\npaddle-steamer of 201 tons burthen, propelled by a pair of\r\nlow-pressure engines of 80 h.p. each. Her length was 98 feet, and\r\nher breadth on deck was 37 feet. She had a dining room capable of\r\naccommodating all the cabin passengers at one sitting, a separate and\r\nneatly decorated cabin for ladies, and two staterooms for families.\r\nShe carried sleeping accommodation for 22 cabin passengers, in\r\naddition to steerage passengers. The fares charged for a single\r\npassage between Liverpool and Belfast were, cabin £1 11s. 6d.,\r\nsteerage 10s. 6d. The WATERLOO made two round voyages per week\r\nduring the season, sailing from Liverpool every Monday and Friday.\r\nShe was intended to carry passengers only (the cargo trade being\r\nmaintained by the smacks), and cost her owners nearly £10,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th July of the same year, the first steamer that traded\r\nbetween Liverpool and Glasgow was advertised in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n     “Safe and Expeditious Travelling between Liverpool\r\n                       and Glasgow.\r\n           The elegant new Steam-Packet Boat,\r\n                ROBERT BRUCE,\r\n                Captain John Patterson,\r\n  will sail for Glasgow on Monday, 2nd August, at Seven\r\n  o’clock in the morning, from George’s Dock, Pierhead.\r\n  The accommodations for passengers are most excellent,\r\n  and she is expected to perform the passage within 30\r\n  hours.\r\n\r\n  “The Fares in the Cabin, 40s.; Steerage, 21s. Passengers\r\n  will be accommodated with Provisions on\r\n  moderate terms. For passage apply to Captain\r\n  Patterson, or to\r\n\r\n                             John Richardson.”\r\n\r\nFrom this date (1819) the expansion of the British steam coasting\r\ntrade was most rapid. Within a very short time regular services were\r\nadvertised between Liverpool and Isle of Man, Whitehaven, Dumfries,\r\nthe Clyde Ports, Belfast and Dublin. Nor were these pioneers of the\r\nsteam trade permitted to be monopolists of their respective stations.\r\nFrequently two, and in some cases three companies advertised steamers\r\nsailing for the same ports, of which some account will be found in\r\nthe succeeding chapters of this volume.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary accident is reported by the “Berwick Advertiser”\r\n(September, 1819), as having occurred to one of the local\r\nsteam-packets. The MORNING STAR, while on her usual passage from\r\nAlloa to Leith, suddenly stopped. On investigation it was discovered\r\nthat a salmon had entered and completely obstructed the condensing\r\nwater pipes, and thus stopped the machinery.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of the following year (1820) steam communication between\r\nthe Ports of London and Hull was projected.\r\n\r\nAcross the Channel the steam-packet TRITON, built at Bordeaux,\r\nmaintained a passenger service, three times each way per week,\r\nbetween Havre and Rouen. The passage occupied about nine hours, and\r\nthe fares charged were 8s. first class, and 4s. second class.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th October, 1820, the steamer CONDE DE PATMELLA, Captain\r\nSilva, sailed from Liverpool for the Brazils. She made a remarkably\r\nrapid passage to Lisbon, arriving there in four days. This is\r\nprobably the first steamer that ever crossed the Atlantic Ocean from\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most remarkable steamers ever launched was a small\r\nsteamboat, named the SNAKE, built at Bombay, and launched in 1820.\r\nShe was the first steamer on the Indus or on any river in India. Her\r\nengines were designed and built by a Parsee, and were the first ever\r\nmanufactured in India. How well they were constructed is evidenced\r\nby their lasting power. After a notable career of 60 years, she was\r\nbroken up in 1880.\r\n\r\nAbove the initials “W. P.,” a correspondent of the “Liverpool\r\nMercury,” in a letter dated 25th October, 1820, suggests the use\r\nof iron ventilators, to supply fresh air to the holds of steamers\r\ncarrying cattle across the Channel, for, of course, at that date,\r\nsteamers to carry cattle across the ocean were unthought of. He\r\ndescribes the ventilators suggested as “iron funnels with movable\r\nvane tops, which could be constructed by any mechanic at a cost of\r\nabout £3 10s. each.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1821, a new steamboat, named the TOURIST, was\r\nlaunched at Perth. When launched she was the largest steamer in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, being 128 feet long by 40 feet broad. She was rigged\r\nas a three-masted schooner, with a clipper bow and bowsprit, and was\r\npropelled by two engines of 40 h.p. each. She was intended (as her\r\nname implies) for the passenger trade between Leith and the Northern\r\nPorts of Scotland, and her owners claimed that communication between\r\nthe ports named “will thus be effected in one-third less time,\r\nand for one-sixth of the expense incurred by the present mode of\r\ntravelling.” After running for a short time in the Leith and North of\r\nScotland trade, she was placed on the station between Newhaven and\r\nLondon, on behalf of the London and Edinburgh Steampacket Co.\r\n\r\nIn May of the same year two steam vessels of upwards of 400\r\ntons burden each, were built for the Leith and London passenger\r\nservice. These steamers were not intended to carry cargo, but they\r\nhad sleeping accommodation for one hundred passengers. They were\r\npropelled by engines of 100 h.p., and were expected to make the\r\npassage in about sixty hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bridge in London]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\n  St. George Steam-Packet Co. incorporated, 1822.—Swift passage of\r\n  the HERO, steam yacht.—Liverpool owned steamers highly commended\r\n  in Parliamentary Report, 1822.—AARON MANBY, iron steamer.—First\r\n  steamer between Hull and the Continent, 1823.—City of Dublin\r\n  Steam-Packet Co. founded, 1823.—H.M.S.

PATRICK and the ST. GEORGE. The\r\nformer was intended to trade between Dublin and Liverpool, and Dublin\r\nand the Bristol Channel; and the latter between Liverpool, the Isle\r\nof Man, and the River Clyde, Mr. Alex. A. Laird, the founder of the\r\nwell-known firm of Alex. A. Laird & Co., being the agent at Greenock.\r\nThe ST. PATRICK was launched at 10-30 a.m. on the 21st April, 1822.\r\nThis event excited great interest in the town of Liverpool, as she\r\nwas, if not the first steamer ever built in the port, certainly the\r\nfinest specimen of the ship-building craft produced there up to that\r\ndate. Her sister ship, the ST. GEORGE, launched the following day,\r\nrapidly won for herself a reputation for comfort and speed. After\r\nrunning about six months she made a voyage from Dublin to Liverpool\r\nin 11½ hours, the shortest time on record. Eighteen months later\r\nshe made a passage from Liverpool to Dublin in 10 hours 40 minutes,\r\nbeating her previous record by 50 minutes. The third steamer was the\r\nPRINCE LLEWELLYN, to ply between Liverpool, Beaumaris, Bangor, and\r\nCarnarvon. The St. George Steam-Packet Co. continued until 1844,\r\nwhen it was re-constructed, the Cork Steamship Co. taking over its\r\nvarious services and seven of its steamers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. David MacBrayne’s Steamer, INVERARY CASTLE. See\r\nParagraph page 43.]\r\n\r\nThe steam-yacht HERO is credited with a phenomenal speedy voyage on\r\nthe 26th July, 1822. She is reported to have steamed from London to\r\nMargate in 6½ hours, being at the rate of 14 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nA report relative to steam navigation was laid before the House of\r\nCommons (August, 1822). All the steam-packets belonging to Liverpool\r\nwere named in a manner highly honourable to their owners, commanders\r\nand constructors.\r\n\r\n  “On Thursday, 9th May, 1822, a large party of distinguished naval\r\n  officers, engineers, &c., embarked at Parliament Stairs, London,\r\n  on board the AARON MANBY, iron steamboat, which immediately got\r\n  under weigh and proceeded to Battersea Bridge; she then descended\r\n  to Blackfriars, and manœuvred for several hours between the two\r\n  bridges in a very superior style. This steamboat was built at the\r\n  Horsley Iron Works, near Birmingham, by Mr. Manby, and put together\r\n  at Rotherhithe. She is the most complete specimen of workmanship in\r\n  the iron way that has ever been witnessed, and draws one foot less\r\n  water than any steamboat that has ever been built. She is 106 feet\r\n  long and 17 feet broad, and is propelled by a 30 h.p. engine and\r\n  Oldham’s revolving bars. This boat will leave London in a few days\r\n  for Paris, the first instance of a direct communication between\r\n  the capitals of France and England. Amongst the gentlemen present\r\n  were Admirals Sir William Hope, Sir Pulteny Malcomb and Sir James\r\n  Wood Gage; Captains Dundas and Napier; Mr. Manby, the inventor;\r\n  Mr. Williams, the patentee of the revolving bars, &c.”—“London\r\n  Courier,” 15th May, 1822.\r\n\r\nOn or about the 24th March, 1823, the steam-packet YORKSHIREMAN\r\narrived at Hull from Antwerp, and was only 31 hours on the passage.\r\nThis vessel is noteworthy as being the first steam vessel to sail\r\nfrom Hull to the Continent.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February of this year (1823) Mr. C. W. Williams,\r\nof Dublin, placed an order with Mr. Wilson, of Liverpool, for the\r\npioneer steamer of the future famous City of Dublin Steam-Packet\r\nCompany, the CITY OF DUBLIN, a vessel of 130 h.p. It was an express\r\nstipulation with the builder, that this steamer should be constructed\r\nof such materials, and in such a manner, as to withstand the\r\nseverity of the winter navigation. The CITY OF DUBLIN differed from\r\nher competitors in two respects, (1) in carrying general cargo in\r\naddition to live stock and passengers, and (2) in maintaining the\r\nservice uninterruptedly throughout the twelve months.\r\n\r\nA month later, Mr. Wilson was again applied to, to build a second\r\nvessel for the company, but in consequence of his having that very\r\nmorning (5th March, 1823) contracted to build the steam-packet HENRY\r\nBELL for the Liverpool and Glasgow trade, it was not till some days\r\nlater the contract was signed for building the TOWN OF LIVERPOOL, to\r\nbe commenced as soon as the HENRY BELL was launched.\r\n\r\nThe CITY OF DUBLIN sailed from Dublin on her maiden voyage to\r\nLiverpool on Saturday, the 20th March, 1824. She anticipated, by\r\nabout six months, the operations of the Dublin and Liverpool Steam\r\nNavigation Co., whose first steamer, the LIFFEY, 305 tons burthen,\r\nand 110 h.p., did not sail until the 13th September following. In\r\nDecember of the same year (1824) the MERSEY joined the LIFFEY, and\r\nin the July following the COMMERCE was added to the Navigation Co.’s\r\nfleet. The COMMERCE was considerably larger than either of her\r\npredecessors, and was launched from the yard of Messrs. Grayson and\r\nLeadley, Trentham Street, Liverpool.\r\n\r\nHer (late) Majesty’s steamship LIGHTNING sailed from Algiers for home\r\non the 27th July, 1824, calling at Gibraltar and Lisbon. She remained\r\nat Lisbon two days taking in coal, and finally arrived at Plymouth\r\nnineteen days after leaving Algiers. The LIGHTNING was one of the\r\nfirst vessels in the British Navy to be supplied with steam power.\r\n\r\nTwo still existing and influential Steamship Companies were\r\nestablished this year. The General Steam Navigation Co., of London,\r\nand the Belfast Steam-Packet Co., afterwards merged into the Belfast\r\nSteamship Co., Limited, of Belfast.\r\n\r\nThe competition between the Steam-Packet Companies engaged in the\r\nScotch and North of Ireland passenger trade had become so keen, that\r\nin the summer of 1825 the steamers from Belfast to Glasgow lowered\r\ntheir fares to 2s. for 1st cabin, 6d. for 2nd cabin, and carried deck\r\npassengers for nothing.\r\n\r\nOn the Dublin and Liverpool station competition was nearly as severe,\r\none steamer sailing in the autumn of 1825 with upwards of 700\r\npassengers carried at 6d. each.\r\n\r\nUnder these adverse circumstances, the proprietors of the Dublin\r\nand Liverpool Steam Navigation Co. deemed it prudent to make terms\r\nwith their more powerful competitor, the City of Dublin Steam-Packet\r\nCo. The managers of the latter company, early in the following year\r\n(1st February, 1826), purchased the Navigation Co.’s steamers, and\r\nincreased the capital of their own company to £250,000, in shares of\r\n£100 each.\r\n\r\nThe Press communications exchanged between the owners of the rival\r\nsteam-packets must have been extremely entertaining to the citizens\r\nof Glasgow of that period. The following extraordinary literary\r\neffusion, from the owners of the steamboat SWIFT, was published in\r\nthe “Glasgow Herald,” of the 30th June, 1825:—\r\n\r\n  “The great superiority of the SWIFT over the Cock Boat that is\r\n  puffed off as sailing direct from the Bromielaw is now so well\r\n  known at Glasgow and Belfast as scarcely to require to be noticed\r\n  in this advertisement, but for the sake of strangers coming from\r\n  a distance it may be proper to state that her power and size are\r\n  double, and her speed so much greater, that when the two vessels\r\n  start together the SWIFT runs the other out of sight in five or\r\n  six hours. Her hours of sailing are so adapted to the tide, as to\r\n  ensure the shortest possible passage, by arriving at Greenock and\r\n  Glasgow about high water, and at Belfast as soon as there is water\r\n  up to the quay.”\r\n\r\nThe following crushing reply of the owners of the steamer referred to\r\nas “the Cock Boat,” appeared in the next issue of the same newspaper.\r\n\r\n  “The fine new Steam-Packet GEORGE CANNING continues to sail for\r\n  Belfast every Tuesday and Friday. She is the only Steam-Packet\r\n  that sails direct from Glasgow, therefore, her passengers are not\r\n  subjected to the delay, inconvenience and risk, attending change of\r\n  vessel and transhipment of luggage.\r\n\r\n  “The GEORGE CANNING has crossed the Channel upwards of 60 times,\r\n  and has in every instance accomplished her passage without putting\r\n  into any intermediate ports.\r\n\r\n  “If the writer of a contemptible article in the SWIFT’S\r\n  advertisement of Friday last, means the GEORGE CANNING, he has\r\n  the merit of stating a gross falsehood, knowing it to be such;\r\n  and, therefore, written for the express purpose of deceiving the\r\n  public!!!\r\n\r\n  “The author of the paragraph alluded to is challenged to produce a\r\n  single instance of the SWIFT having ever accomplished her passage\r\n  from Belfast in so short a period as the GEORGE CANNING.\r\n\r\n  “The public will be surprised to learn, after reading the SWIFT’S\r\n  advertisement, particularly ‘strangers coming from a distance,’\r\n  that the SWIFT and the CANNING have never yet sailed together\r\n  either from Belfast or Glasgow; therefore, the author of the\r\n  SWIFT’S advertisement is left to state when and where the SWIFT ran\r\n  the vessel alluded to out of sight.”\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between these two steamers terminated the following year,\r\nwhen the SWIFT was sold to the London, Leith and Edinburgh Shipping\r\nCompany, and sailed for Leith, via Oban, Fort William and Inverness,\r\non the 27th June, 1826. The GEORGE CANNING was offered for sale by\r\nauction in June, 1831, but was evidently withdrawn. She appears to\r\nhave been sold subsequently by private treaty, and sailed, after\r\nrepairs, for St. Malo, Brittany, in June, 1833.\r\n\r\nThe well-known firm, G. & J. Burns, of Glasgow, commenced business\r\nas steamship owners in 1825. The style of the firm at that time was\r\nJames and George Burns, and their offices were at 45, Miller Street,\r\nbut in February, 1842, they changed the style of the firm to G. & J.\r\nBurns.\r\n\r\nThe first steamer employed by this firm was the new steampacket AYR,\r\nof 76 tons, built by John Wood & Co., of Port Glasgow, and having\r\ntwo engines of 30 h.p. each, by John Nelson, Glasgow. The AYR was\r\nemployed in the Glasgow and Ayrshire and Galloway trade. On the 20th\r\nMarch following (1826) Messrs. Burns despatched their first steamer\r\nfrom Glasgow to Belfast. She was a new steamboat named FINGAL. Her\r\nlength was 116 feet, her beam 21 feet 6 inches, and her depth 12 feet\r\n4 inches. She had two engines of 50 h.p. each. She could accommodate\r\nthirty passengers with sleeping berths, had several horse boxes on\r\ndeck, and carried 180 tons of cargo. The rates for passage were,\r\nin the cabin, 20s., and on deck, 3s.; and the days of sailing from\r\nGlasgow, Tuesdays and Fridays.\r\n\r\nThree years later (March, 1829) Messrs. Burns began their Liverpool\r\nand Glasgow service. The pioneer steamer of this service was the\r\nGLASGOW, a small steamer, 120 tons deadweight, and fitted with two\r\nengines of 30 h.p. each. The Messrs. Burns have ceased for many years\r\nto have any connection with the Glasgow, Ayr and Galloway trade,\r\nbut on the other two stations, Belfast and Liverpool, they have\r\nmaintained continuous services for nearly eighty years. They were\r\nalso largely interested in the Glasgow and West Highland Passenger\r\nServices, but sold their interests in 1851 to Messrs. David Hutcheson\r\n& Co. These services are now conducted by the fleet of splendid\r\nsteamships owned by the Messrs. MacBrayne of Glasgow.[12]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 30th June, 1825, a steam-packet sailed from the\r\nThames for Hamburg, the first that had ever made that voyage.\r\n\r\nThe following month (16th August) the first steamer sailed from\r\nEngland (Falmouth) to Calcutta, via the Cape. This was the wooden\r\npaddle-steamer ENTERPRIZE, 470 tons burthen, 120 h.p. Further\r\nparticulars of this vessel are given in Chapter IX. (Steamship Routes\r\nto India and the East).\r\n\r\nSome idea of the marvellously rapid growth of steam navigation may be\r\ngathered from the fact that in the year 1825, just ten years after\r\nthe arrival of the first steamers on the Thames and Mersey, there\r\nwere 44 steam vessels on the stocks at Liverpool of from 250 to 500\r\ntons each; while in London no less than 45 companies had been formed\r\nto establish steam-packets in every quarter of the globe. Owners of\r\nsailing ships became alarmed for their future, and at a meeting held\r\nin Swansea, on the 14th December, 1826, a resolution was passed to\r\nsend a petition to the House of Commons, praying for the intervention\r\nof Parliament to protect sailing vessels against the further increase\r\nof steamers.\r\n\r\nAmongst those steamers referred to as building at Liverpool was the\r\nERIN, the largest steamer (up to date of launching) ever built in\r\nLiverpool. Her principal dimensions were, length 161 feet, breadth\r\n44 feet. Her tonnage was 500 tons gross, and she was propelled\r\nby engines of 180 h.p., by Fawcett and Co. She was launched from\r\nMr. Rathbone’s yard in February, 1826, and was intended to trade\r\nregularly between London and Belfast, calling at Southampton,\r\nPlymouth and Falmouth. Her owners were the Belfast Steam Navigation\r\nCo., and she cost £20,000.\r\n\r\nHer (late) Majesty’s Steam-Packets, for the conveyance of mails and\r\npassengers between Liverpool and Kingstown, commenced sailing on the\r\n29th August, 1826. Captain John Emerson, R.N. (late Commander of the\r\nST. GEORGE steam-packet), was appointed Captain of one of these Royal\r\nMail Steamers, of which there were four, all built at Liverpool, and\r\neach of 300 tons burthen.\r\n\r\nThe City of Dublin Steam-Packet Company commenced a regular steamship\r\npassenger service between England, Ireland and France in June, 1827.\r\nThe route was from Belfast to Dublin, thence to Bordeaux. Passengers\r\nfrom the North of England were carried by the Company’s steamers\r\nbetween Liverpool and Dublin, connecting at the latter port with\r\nthe steamer to France. The pioneer steamer of the service was the\r\nLEEDS, which sailed on her first voyage from Belfast on Sunday, 17th\r\nJune, and from Dublin on the following Wednesday, continuing to\r\nsail at fortnightly intervals during the season. The venture was so\r\nsuccessful that the Directors of the Company, the following April,\r\nadded the steamers SHEFFIELD and NOTTINGHAM to the service, and\r\nincreased the sailings to the 1st, 10th and 20th of each month.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] For a special account of this Firm, see Part II. of this Volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\n  Steamship Routes to India and the East.—Lieut.

It\r\nwas the intention of the promoters of the meeting that the packets\r\nshould proceed to India by way of the Cape of Good Hope, the route by\r\nwhich the bulk of the trade of Europe with the East had been carried\r\nsince the time of Vasco da Gama. At this meeting it was decided that\r\nLieut. (afterwards Captain) Johnston should proceed to Calcutta,\r\nwith a view to interesting the East India merchants in the proposed\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nLieut. Johnston proceeded to India _via_ Egypt, and although he\r\nwas commissioned to advocate the Cape route, he was convinced on\r\nthis journey of the greater advantages of the route by Suez, and\r\nafterwards became one of its most ardent supporters. Several meetings\r\nwere held in Calcutta after his arrival there, at one of which, held\r\non the 17th December, 1823, it was announced that the Governor, Lord\r\nAmherst, cordially approved of the proposal to establish steamship\r\ncommunication between England and India, and that he was prepared\r\nto recommend his Council to grant as a premium[13] “a gift of 20,000\r\nrupees to whoever, whether individuals or a company, being British\r\nsubjects, should permanently, before the end of 1826, establish a\r\nsteam communication between England and India, either by the Cape of\r\nGood Hope or the Red Sea, and make two voyages out and two voyages\r\nhome, occupying not more than seventy days on each passage.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLOMBO carrying Xmas gifts to the troops in the\r\nCrimea.]\r\n\r\nAn additional 80,000 rupees were raised in India for this object, of\r\nwhich amount the Rajah of Oude subscribed 12,000. On receipt of this\r\ngratifying news in London, another meeting of those interested was\r\nheld, at which sufficient capital was underwritten to justify the\r\npromoters in ordering, as an experiment, the ENTERPRIZE, the first\r\nsteamer destined to double the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nJohnston, having accomplished his assigned task, embarked on board\r\nthe Indiaman ELIZA for England. On his arrival in London he found the\r\nENTERPRIZE two-thirds completed, and on completion he was appointed\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: P. & O. Liner. Date about 1850 A.D.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: P. & O. Liner. Date 1900 A.D.]\r\n\r\nThe ENTERPRIZE was a paddle-steamer, built of wood, by Messrs.\r\nGordon & Co., Deptford, at a cost of £43,000. Her length of keel\r\nwas 122 feet, beam 27 feet, and she registered 479 tons. She had\r\na copper boiler in one piece, which weighed 32 tons, and cost\r\n£7,000. Her engines were 120 horse power, capable of propelling her\r\nin calm weather at the rate of 8 knots per hour. She sailed with\r\n17 passengers from London for Calcutta on the 16th August, 1825,\r\nand arrived at the latter port on the 7th December following. She\r\noccupied 113 days on the passage, partly under steam and partly\r\nunder sail, and inclusive of ten days stoppages for the purpose of\r\nobtaining fresh supplies of fuel. She did not return to England, but\r\nwas purchased by the Indian Government for £40,000, the East India\r\nCompany being at that time engaged in the first Burmese War. She was\r\nemployed carrying despatches between Calcutta and Rangoon, and on the\r\noccasion of the Treaty of Malwa, she saved the Government six lacs\r\nof rupees by reaching Calcutta in time to prevent the march of troops\r\nfrom the upper provinces.\r\n\r\nWhen the ENTERPRIZE arrived at Calcutta from England she was piloted\r\nby a young man, a mate in the Bengal Pilot Service, named Thomas\r\nWaghorn.\r\n\r\nMr. Waghorn was born at Chatham in 1800, and was, consequently, in\r\nhis twenty-sixth year when he acted as pilot for the ENTERPRIZE.\r\nHe had served four years in the Royal Navy, and was afterwards for\r\ntwelve years in the service of the East India Company as pilot,\r\nsubsequently rejoining the Royal Navy, in which he remained until he\r\nobtained his commission as Lieutenant. He was selected in 1827, by\r\nthe Indian Government (Calcutta Steam Committee), for the purpose of\r\nestablishing steam navigation between England and India. He visited\r\nLondon, Liverpool, and Manchester, but could not obtain sufficient\r\nfinancial support for a regular service of steamers _via_ the\r\nCape of Good Hope. Hearing that it was the intention of the East\r\nIndia Company to despatch the ENTERPRIZE to Suez, he offered his\r\nservices as Courier to the East to Mr. Lock (Chairman of the East\r\nIndia Company), and to Lord Ellenborough (President of the Board of\r\nControl). His offer of service was accepted, and he left London on\r\nthe 28th October, 1829, taking the overland route, _via_ Trieste, to\r\nAlexandria, where he arrived on the 27th November. His instructions\r\nwere to proceed with his despatches for the Governor of Bombay (Sir\r\nJohn Malcolm), by the steampacket ENTERPRIZE from Suez, but owing\r\nto a breakdown of her machinery, the steampacket was not at Suez to\r\nmeet him. There being no steamer to take him on to his destination,\r\nMr. Waghorn embarked on an open native boat, and sailed down the Red\r\nSea, being subsequently picked up by the East India Company’s sloop\r\nTHETIS, which had been sent to meet him, and which brought him to\r\nBombay. The day previous to the arrival of Mr. Waghorn at Bombay, the\r\nEast India Company had despatched the steamer HUGH LINDSAY to Suez\r\nto take up the sailing of the disabled ENTERPRIZE. The HUGH LINDSAY\r\ncontinued to make one round voyage between Bombay and Suez annually\r\nuntil 1836, during the north-east monsoons, not being sufficiently\r\npowerful to make the passage during the south-west monsoons. In 1836\r\nthe Court of Directors of the East India Company decided to place\r\non the station two new and more powerful steamers. These were the\r\nATALANTA, of 616 tons burthen and 210 horse power, built in 1835 at a\r\ncost of £36,652; and the BERENICE, of 664 tons and 230 horse power,\r\nbuilt the same year at a cost of £40,124.\r\n\r\nWhile a regular steamship service was thus being established\r\nbetween the Isthmus of Suez and Bombay, the British Government\r\nhad established a service of Admiralty packets between Falmouth\r\nand Cadiz, Gibraltar, Malta, and Corfu. From Malta the mails were\r\nconveyed to Alexandria by other of H.M. ships. Prior to 1830 the\r\nAdmiralty packets were all sailing brigs, but on the 5th February\r\nof that year the METEOR, the first of the steampackets, sailed from\r\nFalmouth to the Mediterranean. She was followed by the steampackets\r\nAFRICAN, CARRON, COLUMBIA, CONFRANCE, ECHO, FIREBRAND, HERMES and\r\nMESSENGER.\r\n\r\nAbout 1834 Messrs. Bourne, of Dublin, the principal owners of the\r\nDublin and London Steampacket Company, were induced by the Spanish\r\nMinister in London to start a line of steamers between London and the\r\nPeninsula. They placed the management of the steamers in the hands\r\nof Messrs. Willcox and Anderson, a London firm with whom they had\r\nhad some previous transactions. Messrs. Willcox and Anderson were\r\nwell acquainted with the trade to the Peninsula, having been engaged\r\nin it, at first with sailing vessels, and afterwards with chartered\r\nsteamers. The new line was called the Peninsular Steam Navigation\r\nCompany, and Mr. James Allan, then a clerk in the Dublin Office of\r\nthe Dublin and London Steampacket Company, was sent to London to\r\nassist Messrs. Willcox and Anderson in the management.\r\n\r\nThe first steamer of the service was probably the ROYAL TAR,\r\nbelonging to the Dublin and London Steampacket Company, which had\r\nbeen chartered in 1834 to Don Pedro, and subsequently to the Queen\r\nRegent of Spain, Messrs. Willcox and Anderson being the chartering\r\nbrokers. The “Graphic” Xmas Number for 1901 states the WM. FAWCETT\r\nwas the first P. & O. steamer, and the “P. & O. Pocket Book” (1900\r\nedition) heads the list of the past and present fleet of the company\r\nwith the name of the same vessel, built in 1829. It is only necessary\r\nto say here that neither the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company\r\nnor the P. & O. Steam Navigation Company were in existence at that\r\ndate. The WM. FAWCETT was certainly built that year by Caleb Smith,\r\nand engined by Fawcett and Preston, both Liverpool firms. For some\r\ntime she was engaged as a ferry boat on the Mersey, and in the early\r\nthirties she was employed as a regular trader between London and\r\nDublin. She probably was chartered for a short time to the Peninsular\r\nSteam Navigation Company in 1835 or 1836, as she does not appear in\r\nthe company’s advertised sailing list for 1838.\r\n\r\nIn the latter year the fleet consisted of the following vessels, from\r\nLondon to Vigo, Lisbon, Cadiz and Gibraltar:—TAGUS, 800 tons gross,\r\n300 h. p.; ROYAL TAR, 650 tons gross, 264 h. p.; BRAGANZA, 650 tons\r\ngross, 264 h. p.; IBERIA, 690 tons gross, 200 h. p.; LIVERPOOL,[14]\r\n500 tons gross, 160 h. p.; CITY OF LONDONDERRY,[14] 500 tons gross,\r\n160 h. p. Branch steamers, PENINSULA, GUADALQUIVER, ESTRELLA and SOL.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 the Government advertised for tenders from steamship owners\r\nfor the conveyance of the mails between Falmouth and the Peninsula,\r\nwhich up to that time were conveyed by sailing brigs which left\r\nFalmouth for Lisbon every week, “wind and weather permitting.”\r\nIn response to this advertisement two companies, the British and\r\nForeign Steam Navigation Company, and the Peninsular Steam Navigation\r\nCompany, sent in tenders. The former company having failed to show\r\nthat it had adequate means for the efficient performance of the\r\nPostal service, the Government concluded a contract, on the 29th\r\nAugust, 1837, with the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company, by which\r\nthat company agreed to convey monthly the whole of the Peninsular\r\nmails for an annual subsidy of £29,600, afterwards reduced to\r\n£20,500. The first steamer to be despatched under this contract was\r\nthe IBERIA, in September, 1837, calling at Vigo, Oporto, Lisbon and\r\nCadiz, on its passage to and from Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe British Government in 1839 entered into an arrangement with\r\nthe French Government to send letters to and from India through\r\nFrance by way of Marseilles. The mails were conveyed between\r\nMarseilles and Malta by an Admiralty packet, and between Malta and\r\nAlexandria by another Admiralty packet. This arrangement did not\r\nwork satisfactorily, and the Government advertised for tenders for a\r\nline of steamers, to run direct from England to Alexandria and _vice\r\nversa_, touching only at Gibraltar and Malta. The steamers were to\r\nbe of sufficient power to perform the voyage in not more than three\r\ndays beyond the time then occupied in the conveyance of the mails\r\n_via_ France, and the cost was not to exceed the amount required for\r\nthe maintenance of the small and inefficient Admiralty packets then\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nFour competitors tendered for the contract, but that of the\r\nPeninsular Company was accepted, it being the lowest (£34,200), and\r\ncontaining also an offer to convey at a reduced rate all officers\r\ntravelling on the public service, and _bona fide_ Admiralty packages\r\ngratuitously.\r\n\r\nAt this time much pressure was brought to bear on the Government to\r\ninduce it to subsidize a proposed line of steamers between Falmouth\r\nand Calcutta _via_ the Cape of Good Hope. These steamers, according\r\nto the “Times” of the 11th November, 1838, were to make the passage\r\nin thirty days.\r\n\r\nThe GREAT LIVERPOOL, of 1,540 tons and 464 horse power, built by Sir\r\nJohn Tobin, of Liverpool, and intended for the Liverpool and New York\r\ntrade; and the ORIENTAL, of 1,600 tons and 450 horse power, were the\r\nsteamers offered by Messrs. Willcox and Anderson, and approved by the\r\nAdmiralty, to convey mails between England and Alexandria, calling\r\nat Gibraltar, and combining the two mail services of the Peninsular\r\nand the Oriental, thus constituting the Peninsular and Oriental\r\nSteam Navigation Company. Subsequently, the company was requested to\r\nprovide two steamers, one to be not less than 250 horse power, and\r\nthe other to be 140 horse power, for the Malta and Corfu branch of\r\nthe mail service, which was done at a cost to the country of £10,712\r\nper annum, less than the cost of maintaining the Admiralty packets\r\npreviously employed.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1842, the P. & O. Company obtained a contract for\r\ncarrying the mails between Calcutta and Suez. The contract was\r\ngranted very reluctantly by the East India Company, and only after\r\nmuch pressure had been brought to bear on it by the Home Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th September, 1842, the P. & O. Company despatched its\r\nfirst steamer to India _via_ the Cape of Good Hope. She was the\r\npaddle-steamer HINDOSTAN, of 2,017 tons gross and of 520 horse power.\r\nOn her arrival at Calcutta she was placed on the service between\r\nCalcutta, Madras, Ceylon and Suez. Other steamers were despatched\r\nspeedily from England, and in 1844 the company was in a position to\r\nenter into another contract with the Government for a monthly service\r\nfrom Ceylon, to Penang, Singapore, and Hong Kong. For the premier\r\nservice (Suez-Calcutta) the company received £115,000 per annum, or\r\nat the rate of 20s. per mile, and for the Ceylon-Hongkong service\r\n£45,000, or at the rate of about 12s. per mile.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Eastern services, coaling stations, docks,\r\nstore establishments, and in such places as Suez and Aden, even\r\nfresh-water supplies had to be, and were, provided and organised.\r\n\r\nAt this period, and until the completion of the Railway from\r\nAlexandria to Suez, the passengers and cargo carried by the P. & O.\r\nsteamers were conveyed across Egypt in a somewhat primitive manner.\r\nThe Mahmoudieh Canal enabled the company to transport its passengers\r\nand cargo from Alexandria to the Nile, whence they proceeded by\r\nsteamer to Cairo, and thence through the desert on the backs of\r\ncamels, a distance of less than 100 miles, to Suez.\r\n\r\nAs it was notorious that the mail service between Suez and Bombay was\r\nconducted by the East India Company at a cost of upwards of 30s. per\r\nmile by steamers vastly inferior in speed and accommodation to the P.\r\n& O. steamers, which maintained the mail services to India and the\r\nprincipal ports of China at an average rate of about 17s. per mile,\r\nthe public naturally demanded that the Suez-Bombay service should\r\nbe taken out of the control of the East India Company, and placed in\r\nthe hands of those competent to work it more efficiently and with\r\ngreater economy. The demands of the public, although confirmed by the\r\nParliamentary Committee of 1851, were successfully resisted by the\r\nCourt of Directors until 1854, and it is questionable if even then,\r\nthey would have given up the service if (in consequence of the East\r\nIndia Company having no steamer ready for them at Suez) the Bombay\r\nmails had not been lost in a native sailing craft into which they had\r\nbeen transferred at Aden.\r\n\r\nThe P. & O. Company were applied to by the Government, and undertook\r\nthis service for the sum of £24,700 per annum, or at the rate of 6s.\r\n2d. per mile, resulting in a decreased expenditure of about £80,000\r\nper annum, as compared with the expense incurred by the far less\r\nefficient East Indian Navy.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, the P. & O. Company extended its operations to Australia, by\r\nmeans of a branch line of steamers from Singapore. The following year\r\nsaw an addition of no less than eleven steamships to the company’s\r\nfleet. Amongst these was the celebrated troopship HIMALAYA, which\r\ncontinued in active service until near the end of the century. At\r\nthe time of her launch she was the largest steamship afloat, and of\r\nextraordinary speed. She cost £132,000 when fully equipped and ready\r\nfor sea. Her length was 340 feet, beam 44 feet 6 inches; her gross\r\ntonnage was 3,438 tons, and her engines indicated 2,050 horse power.\r\n\r\nAnother famous steamer built for the P. & O. in 1853 was the COLOMBO\r\n(steamship), which was engaged as a Government transport during\r\nthe Crimean War. Even Santa Claus himself could not have been more\r\neagerly welcomed than was the COLOMBO when she arrived off Sebastopol\r\non Christmas Eve, 1854, with provisions for the wounded soldiers\r\nand sailors. She was originally a vessel of 1,864 tons gross, but\r\nin 1859 she was lengthened amidships, and her tonnage increased to\r\n2,127 tons. The HIMALAYA and the COLOMBO were two, out of eleven, P.\r\n& O. steamships chartered to the Government as transports during the\r\nCrimean War, and these vessels conveyed during the continuation of\r\nhostilities 1,800 officers, 60,000 men and 15,000 horses.\r\n\r\nThe first steamer of the P. & O. Company fitted with compound engines\r\nwas the MOOLTAN (steamship), of 2,257 tons, built in 1860-1. Several\r\nsucceeding steamers were fitted with the same type of engines, but\r\nalthough the consumption of fuel was decidedly less, the engines\r\nthemselves proved so unreliable that they were taken out of all the\r\nships and replaced by the old style of engines. “It was not until\r\n1869” (says Sir Thomas Sutherland, in the “P. & O. Pocket Book,”\r\n1900) “that the company succeeded in building a steamer with high\r\nand low pressure machinery which could be considered thoroughly\r\nsuccessful.”\r\n\r\nOn the 17th November, 1869, the Suez Canal, the greatest engineering\r\nwork of the 19th century, was formally opened by the Empress Eugenie,\r\nin the presence of numerous distinguished men from all countries.\r\nWhile the benefits conferred upon the world of commerce by the\r\nopening of this canal can hardly be over-estimated, its influence\r\nupon the fortunes of the P. & O. Company was at first almost fatal.\r\nThe whole of the company’s business had to be re-organised, and as\r\nspeedily as possible a new fleet obtained adapted to the changed\r\nrequirements of the company’s services. This transitory state\r\ncontinued for a period of five years, from 1870 to 1875, by which\r\ndate the company’s re-organization was sufficiently accomplished\r\nto enable them to transfer their services from the Overland to the\r\nSuez Canal route. The accelerated mails sent _via_ Brindisi were\r\nstill carried by the Egyptian Railway between Alexandria and Suez,\r\nand continued to be so carried until 1888, when they also were\r\ntransferred to the Canal route.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare the earlier vessels of the company’s\r\nfleet with the later. The INDIA, built in 1839, was a vessel of\r\n871 tons, and with engines of 300 horse power. Her namesake, built\r\nin 1896, is a steamer of 7,911 tons, with engines of 11,000 horse\r\npower. The PERSIA, built in 1900, has a slightly larger register\r\n(8,000 tons), with engines of the same power. In 1901 four twin-screw\r\nsteamers were added to the fleet, the SYRIA, SOUDAN, SOMALI and\r\nSICILIA, each of 6,600 tons gross, with engines of 4,500 horse\r\npower, while 1903-4 witnesses the addition to the Company’s list of\r\nthe MARMORA and MACEDONIA, 10,500 tons and 15,000 horse power, and\r\nthe MOLDAVIA and MONGOLIA, 10,000 tons and 14,000 horse power, as\r\nwell as several cargo steamers of immense tonnage.\r\n\r\nDuring the war in the Transvaal, as at the time of the Crimean War,\r\nmany of the steamers of the P. & O. Company were engaged by the\r\nGovernment as transports.\r\n\r\nThe following figures indicate the extensive operations of the\r\ncompany:—In 1899 the mileage traversed by the steamers of the fleet\r\nduring the year was about 3,000,000 miles. The consumption of coal\r\nduring that period was 625,000 tons. The dues paid to the Suez\r\nCanal Company exceeded £272,000, while the sum expended in wages to\r\nofficers and crews amounted to £362,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the Directors of the East India Company advertised for\r\nsteamers to carry the mails between Calcutta and Burmah, a\r\nservice inaugurated by the ENTERPRIZE (see ante) in 1826, and\r\nafterwards conducted by various vessels of the East Indian Navy.\r\nMessrs. McKinnon & Co., of Glasgow, tendered in response to this\r\nadvertisement, and their tender having been accepted, they despatched\r\nthe two steamers BALTIC and CAPE OF GOOD HOPE to fulfil their\r\ncontract. These vessels were small and unsuitable for the intended\r\nservice, and the result would have been a serious financial loss to\r\ntheir owners, had they not, soon after their arrival in India, been\r\nengaged for transports on the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny.\r\n\r\nThe new company traded under the title of the Calcutta and Burmah\r\nSteam Navigation Co., its first operations being confined to the\r\nports of Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon and Moulmein. One of the two\r\npioneer steamers, the CAPE OF GOOD HOPE, collided with a P. and\r\nO. steamer and sunk in the Hooghly. Another, the CALCUTTA, of 900\r\ntons, was totally lost off the coast of Wicklow, when on her first\r\nvoyage from the Clyde to Calcutta. A fresh contract was entered into\r\nin 1862 with the Indian Government, and in the same year the title\r\nof the Company was changed to the British India Steam Navigation\r\nCo., Limited. The terms of the new contract included the transport\r\nof troops and stores at a mileage rate; a mail service every\r\nfortnight between Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon and Moulmein; also a\r\nmonthly service via the two latter ports to Singapore; a similar\r\nservice to Chittagong, and one to the Andaman Islands; as well as\r\none between Madras and Rangoon; a fortnightly service between Bombay\r\nand Karachi; and a service, once every six weeks, to various ports\r\nin the Persian Gulf. New vessels were built and despatched for these\r\nvarious services, and the traffic of the Company developed with great\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nThe career of the Company was, however, not an unchequered one. In\r\naddition to the two steamers referred to as lost during the first\r\nyear of the Company’s existence, must be added the wreck of the\r\nBURMAH on the Madras coast, the loss of the BUSSORAH on her voyage to\r\nIndia, and the foundering of the PERSIA on her voyage from Rangoon\r\nto Calcutta, during one of those fearful cyclones which periodically\r\nsweep the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, which for a time adversely\r\naffected the fortunes of the P. and O. Co., proved beneficial to\r\nthe British India Steam Navigation Co. The directors of the latter\r\nCompany at once took advantage of the facilities which it offered,\r\nand their steamer INDIA, requiring new boilers, was despatched to\r\nEngland, and was the first steamer to arrive in London with a cargo\r\nof Indian produce via the Suez Canal. Since that date the Company has\r\nadded steamer to steamer until at the present date (1903) its fleet\r\n(inclusive of the British India Association steamers) numbers upwards\r\nof 120 vessels.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1891, Messrs. Bibby Brothers, of Liverpool (a firm which\r\nwas founded in 1807), established a direct service of first-class\r\nand swift steamers between the United Kingdom and Burmese ports. For\r\nhalf a century prior to 1901 Messrs. Bibby had maintained steamship\r\ncommunication between Liverpool and all the principal ports of the\r\nMediterranean. Prior to the construction of the Suez Canal, cargo\r\nfrom the East was carried by the P. and O. to Suez, thence by rail\r\nto Alexandria, where it was transhipped to the Bibby steamers, which\r\nloaded in Alexandria for Liverpool.[15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Early Bibby Liner SICILIAN (1859), the first steamer\r\nbuilt by Messrs. HARLAND & WOLFF.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Lindsay’s History of Commerce, page 339.\r\n\r\n[14] Chartered Steamers belonging to the City of Dublin Co.\r\n\r\n[15] A sketch of the history of this important Firm will be found in\r\nPart II. of this Volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSteamers on the Pacific.—The TELICA (1825).—P. S. N. Co.,\r\n1840.—Compound Engines adopted, 1856.—Service extended from West\r\nCoast, South America, to the River Plate (1865), and to Liverpool,\r\n1868.—The P. S. N. Co. and Messrs. Anderson Anderson & Co.,\r\n1878.—Gulf Line of Steamers between Great Britain and West Coast,\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first steamer to trade along the Pacific Coast of South America\r\nwas a small steamer, named the TELICA, in 1825. She was owned and\r\ncommanded by a Spaniard bearing a Russian name, Mitrovitch. The\r\nventure proved a failure, chiefly owing to the scarcity of fuel,\r\nand the unfortunate man, in a fit of despair, fired his pistol into\r\na barrel of gunpowder, and blew up his vessel in the harbour of\r\nGuayaquil, destroying himself and all on board, except one man.\r\n\r\nThe next person to attempt to establish steamship communication along\r\nthe Pacific Coast was an American citizen, Mr. William Wheelwright,\r\nborn in Newburyport, Mass., U.S.A., in 1798, and appointed United\r\nStates Consul at Guayaquil in 1824. Mr. Wheelwright, notwithstanding\r\nthe tragic fate of the TELICA and her owner, was convinced of the\r\nimportance of steam communication to the development of the rich\r\nresources of the western side of the South American Continent,\r\nspent six years in arranging plans for steam communication between\r\nthe different Republics, and at last obtained from the Peruvian,\r\nBolivian, and Chilian Governments the privilege of establishing and\r\nmaintaining a steamship service along their respective coasts for a\r\nperiod of ten years. In pursuance of this object he came to England,\r\nand secured the co-operation of several wealthy merchants, and on the\r\n17th February, 1840, a charter was obtained for the establishment\r\nof the undertaking known as the Pacific Steam Navigation Company,\r\ntogether with a small subsidy for the conveyance of the mails. It was\r\nnot the intention of the founders of the company to trade elsewhere\r\nthan along the Pacific Coast, and for this purpose a capital of a\r\nquarter of a million pounds was thought to be sufficient. The capital\r\nconsisted of 5,000 shares, £50 each. Only the amount required to\r\nbuild two small steamers was called up. These steamers were the CHILI\r\nand PERU, each of about 700 tons gross register, with engines of\r\nabout 150 horse-power nominal. They were brig-rigged paddle steamers,\r\nbuilt of wood, by Charles Young and Co., Limehouse, London, and\r\nengined by Miller & Ravenhall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERU. Pacific Steam Navigation Co., Ltd.]\r\n\r\nOwing in great measure to the scarcity of fuel on the coast, the\r\ncompany, during the first five years of its existence, sustained a\r\nloss of four-fifths of its paid-up capital, but the shareholders\r\ncourageously resolved to persevere with their undertaking. The seat\r\nof management of the company was, however, transferred from London to\r\nLiverpool (1846), and the late Mr. William Just appointed Managing\r\nDirector. The following year (1847), the Directors were for the first\r\ntime able to declare a dividend, a modest two-and-a-half per cent.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, having obtained an extension of the Government Postal\r\ncontract, the Directors ordered four steamers, at a total cost of\r\n£140,000. These steamers were named the LIMA, SANTIAGO, QUITO and\r\nBOGOTA, and were each of about 1,000 tons gross and 300 horse-power\r\nnominal.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 the company’s service was re-organised by Mr. Just, who\r\nvisited the West Coast specially for that purpose. During the same\r\nyear the compound type of engines was adopted in the company’s\r\nsteamers, the Pacific Steam Navigation Company being thus one of the\r\nearliest ocean steamship companies to use this type of engine.\r\n\r\nA supplemental charter was obtained in 1865, extending the operations\r\nof the company, and authorising steamship communication between the\r\nWest Coast of South America, and the River Plate on the East Coast.\r\n\r\nAs the profits of the company had been steadily increasing for a\r\nnumber of years prior to 1867, it was resolved at a meeting of\r\nshareholders, held in December of that year, to establish a monthly\r\nline of steamers from Liverpool to the West Coast of South America,\r\n_via_ the Straits of Magellan, and to increase the capital of the\r\ncompany to £2,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe first new steamer of the new service was the PACIFIC, 1,630 tons\r\ngross register, 1,174 tons net, with engines of 450 horse-power.\r\nHer principal dimensions were, length 267 feet, beam 40 feet, depth\r\n17 feet. She was built on the Clyde in 1864, by Randolph Elder &\r\nCo., and cost £61,855. After trading for about three years on the\r\nPacific Coast, she sailed from Valparaiso for Liverpool in May,\r\n1868, as the pioneer steamer of the new mail service. During this\r\nyear five steamers of about 3,000 tons each, specially built for the\r\nmaintenance of this service, were added to the company’s fleet. These\r\nwere the JOHN ELDER, MAGELLAN, PATAGONIA, ARAUCANIA and CORDILLERA.\r\n\r\nSo profitable was the Liverpool trade to the West Coast, the\r\nDirectors determined in 1870 to make the sailings fortnightly, and\r\nin that year they added the steamers CHIMBORAZO, CUZCO, GARONNE,\r\nLUSITANIA and ACONCAGUA to the fleet.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1871 they recommended a further increase of the\r\ncompany’s capital to £3,000,000, with a view of making the service\r\nfrom Liverpool a weekly one. During the year they had greatly\r\nincreased the number of the company’s ocean steamers, having built\r\nin 1871 seven steamers, each of about 4,000 tons gross, viz., the\r\nSORATA, ILLIMANI, COTOPAXI, GALICIA, CORCOVADO, PUNO and POTOSI.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1872, the capital of the company was raised to £4,000,000,\r\nand the steamers VALPARAISO and BRITANNIA were added to its fleet,\r\nand in the following year the IBERIA and LIGURIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORELLANA. Pacific Steam Navigation Co., Ltd.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above steamers, which were all built for the\r\nLiverpool to West Coast service, the Pacific Steam Navigation Company\r\nbuilt during the years 1869 to 1873 inclusive, eighteen steamers for\r\nits Pacific Coast service.\r\n\r\nThe IBERIA and LIGURIA were the last of the barque-rigged,\r\nclipper-bow type of steamer built for the Pacific Steam Navigation\r\nCompany. The succeeding vessels of the fleet have as a rule four pole\r\nmasts and a straight stem.\r\n\r\nAlthough the trade between Liverpool and the West Coast of South\r\nAmerica had increased with marvellous rapidity, the increase in the\r\ncompany’s tonnage had more than kept pace with it. It was found that\r\nthe combined passenger and cargo trade would not support a sailing\r\neach week, and the sailings were reduced to two each month. As a\r\nconsequence of the reduced number of sailings, as many as nine of the\r\ncompany’s steamers were at one time laid up for want of employment.\r\nIn 1878 the Directors were fortunately able to charter four of their\r\nvessels, the CHIMBORAZO, LUSITANIA, CUZCO and GARONNE, to Messrs.\r\nAnderson, Anderson & Co., who in that year founded the Orient Line\r\nof steamers from London to Australia. In 1882, when the latter\r\ncompany decided to double its sailings, the Pacific Steam Navigation\r\nCompany made arrangements to employ several additional steamers in\r\nthe Australian service. Although the Pacific Company was the first\r\nto establish steamship communication between Great Britain and the\r\nWest Coast of South America, it has had to share the traffic in\r\nlater years with the Gulf Line of steamers belonging to the Greenock\r\nShipping Company, and with the steamers belonging to Messrs. Lamport\r\n& Holt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ships in harbor]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFrench-Algerian Expedition, 1830.—Civil War in Portugal.—Loss of the\r\nsteamer RIVAL.—Mutiny on a Transport.—Loss of the LORD BLANEY.—The\r\nMARGARET, first screw passenger steamer trading from Hull.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1830, the French Government, fitted out an\r\nexpedition against the Dey of Algiers, and an agent of the former\r\nwas instructed to contract with the City of Dublin and the St.\r\nGeorge Steam-Packet Companies for the employment of some of their\r\nfirst-class boats as transports in the expedition. The vessels\r\nchartered were ordered to proceed immediately to Toulon to embark\r\nFrench troops for service in North Africa. This was the first\r\ninstance of steam vessels being extensively engaged in warlike\r\nexpeditions. At this date, Portugal was engaged in a prolonged and\r\nsanguinary civil war, in the course of which vessels belonging to\r\nboth of the famous Liverpool steamship companies were again employed.\r\n\r\nDon Miguel (surnamed the Usurper) had about the year 1826 assumed\r\nthe government of Portugal. It is calculated that in the short space\r\nof five years he imprisoned 26,270 of his beloved subjects; 16,000\r\nwere transported to various places; 13,000 were forced to fly from\r\nhis paternal government; 13,700 perished on the scaffold; and 5,000\r\nwere either in concealment or wandering about the kingdom to avoid\r\na similar fate. Finally, Dom Pedro, Emperor of Brazil, on behalf of\r\nhis daughter Donna Maria of Portugal, took active measures to recover\r\nthe throne. A number of British steamers were engaged as transports\r\nor privateers in the civil war that ensued. Amongst other vessels was\r\nthe “ill-fated steamer”[16] RIVAL, which sailed from Greenock on the\r\n22nd December, 1832, bound for Oporto, with about 400 volunteers for\r\nDom Pedro, and foundered in Galway Bay, with the loss of nearly 500\r\nlives. Some spars, bedding, and ship’s papers were washed ashore, but\r\nas not one of the passengers or crew escaped, no particulars can ever\r\nbe known of the circumstances attending the fatal disaster.\r\n\r\nThe LORD BLANEY was one of several of the St. George Steam-Packet\r\nCompany’s vessels chartered for the same service. It appears from a\r\nrecord of magisterial proceedings (August, 1831) before Mr. H. Leach,\r\nof Milford, that the agents employed by Dom Pedro hired 200 seamen at\r\nLiverpool, and induced them to ship on board the LORD BLANEY, under a\r\npretext that they were merely wanted to navigate British transports\r\nacross the Atlantic, to convey some regiments of Portuguese from Rio\r\nde Janeiro to Europe; but no sooner had the LORD BLANEY got fairly\r\ninto the Irish Channel than the officers threw off the mask, and\r\nacknowledged their destination to be Belle Isle, for the purpose of\r\nmanning Dom Pedro’s fleet. Finding themselves thus entrapped, the\r\nseamen exhibited signs of mutiny, and a violent gale of wind having\r\nforced the steamer into Milford Haven for shelter, the whole body\r\nof tars went ashore with bed and baggage, declaring their intention\r\nnot to fight under any flag but that of England. After completing\r\nher engagement with Dom Pedro, the LORD BLANEY was placed on the\r\nLiverpool and Newry service, and on the 18th December, 1833, she was\r\nlost with all hands (45) whilst on a voyage from Newry to Liverpool.\r\nA subscription list was opened for the benefit of the families and\r\nrelatives of the crew and passengers. The City of Dublin Steam-Packet\r\nCo., although in active opposition to the St. George Steam-Packet\r\nCo., headed the list with the handsome donation of £100. Two, at\r\nleast, of the City of Dublin Steam-Packet Co.’s vessels took part in\r\nthe Portuguese war, the LEEDS and the BIRMINGHAM. The latter steamer,\r\nunder the command of Captain Beazley, arrived at Falmouth about the\r\n15th July, 1833. She brought despatches from Lagos which contained\r\nintelligence of the most important and decisive nature, nothing less\r\nthan the complete defeat and capture of the fleet of the Usurper.\r\nThe news was received with the utmost satisfaction in England as well\r\nas Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe MARGARET steamship sailed from Hamburg to Hull on Friday, 19th\r\nOctober, 1845, with a number of passengers and a full general cargo.\r\nShortly after leaving the Elbe she encountered a north-west gale,\r\nand after beating against it for two days, she was driven on to a\r\ndangerous bank called the Memmett, near Juist, at the entrance to the\r\nriver Memm. The moment she took the shoal, the sea, which was running\r\nvery high, swept several overboard. The long boat was launched and\r\nan attempt made to reach the shore, but owing to it being crowded\r\nit capsized, and every soul in it perished. From advices received,\r\nit appears that altogether sixteen of the passengers and three of\r\nthe crew were lost. Those who remained on board the vessel, after\r\nsevere privations, were rescued. The MARGARET was owned by Mr. Pimm,\r\nof Hull; was several years old; was about 250 tons burthen, and\r\nwas rigged as a three-masted schooner. She was worked by a screw\r\npropeller, and was the first vessel of that description engaged in\r\nthe passenger trade from the port of Hull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steamship]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arrival of SIRIUS P. S. at New York, 23rd April,\r\n1838.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] There is some doubt as to whether this vessel was a steamer or a\r\nsailing brig. “The Liverpool Mercury” speaks of her as the “ill-fated\r\nsteamer, RIVAL”; but the “Glasgow Herald” only refers to her as the\r\n“brig RIVAL.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  Pioneers of Transatlantic steam navigation.—Valentia Transatlantic\r\n  S. N. Co. incorporated, 1828.—Dr. Lardner’s famous speech on\r\n  Steam Navigation.—The ROYAL WILLIAM, first steamer from Canada\r\n  to England, 1833; sold to Spanish Government and re-named YSABEL\r\n  SEGUNDA.—The British Queen S. N.

In the interval, all the chief ports of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, and several of the continental ports, had been connected\r\nby steampacket services. So early as 1828 it had been proposed\r\nto establish steam communication between the West of Ireland and\r\nAmerica, and an Act of Parliament for incorporating the Valentia\r\nTransatlantic Steam Navigation Company was obtained. The proposed\r\ncapital was £24,000, in shares of £50 each. The first steamer was\r\nestimated to cost £21,000. She was to be a vessel of about 800 tons\r\nburthen, driven by engines of 200 h.p., and was expected to make\r\nsix round voyages per annum. She was to accommodate 50 cabin and\r\n50 steerage passengers, and to carry 200 tons cargo, exclusive of\r\nbunkers. It appears from the following extract from the “Liverpool\r\nAlbion” of the 14th December, 1835, that although the projectors of\r\nthe Valentia Company advertised in 1828 that the company was “to\r\ncommence immediate operations,” its first sailing had not taken place\r\nseven years later. The scheme fell through for want of support,\r\nbut in 1835 it was started afresh in conjunction with the railway\r\nfrom London, the Post Office Packets, and the Valentia Railway.\r\nThe extract is valuable also as containing Dr. Lardner’s famous\r\ndictum concerning the possibility of direct steam navigation between\r\nLiverpool and New York:—\r\n\r\n  “Steam Communication with America.\r\n\r\n  “Dr. Lardner then proceeded to observe that one of the grandest\r\n  projects which had ever occupied the human mind was at present in\r\n  the process of actual accomplishment. He meant that of constructing\r\n  a great highway for steam intercourse between New York and\r\n  London—between the capital of the New World and that of the Old.\r\n  Part of the highway was in process of formation. It consisted of\r\n  several stages—that of the railroad from London to Birmingham;\r\n  that from Birmingham to Liverpool, and the steam intercourse with\r\n  Dublin; but there was another stage—that from Dublin to Valentia,\r\n  which had as yet hardly been thought of. Ireland was a country\r\n  which, with all her political disadvantages, was blest by nature\r\n  with a vast number of physical advantages, and amongst the rest\r\n  he might reckon a vast number of excellent harbours. No country\r\n  in the world could boast of so many fine and spacious ports, bays\r\n  and roadsteads. She had many harbours on her west coast which\r\n  would serve admirably as stations for steam conveyance across the\r\n  Atlantic; but Valentia had been selected as the extreme westerly\r\n  point suitable for that purpose. It was a fine anchoring ground\r\n  by an island of that name on the coast of Munster. The distance\r\n  from Dublin to this point was under 200 miles, which might be\r\n  traversed in about 8 hours. The nearest point on the continent\r\n  of North America to this point of Ireland was St. John’s in\r\n  Newfoundland. The distance between the two was about 1,900 miles;\r\n  thence to Halifax, in Nova Scotia, there would be another run\r\n  of 550 miles, and from that to New York would not exceed the\r\n  admissible range; but touching at Halifax would be desirable for\r\n  the sake of passengers. The only difficulty would be as to the\r\n  run from Valentia to St. John’s; and the voyage from Dublin to\r\n  Bordeaux and back, a distance of between 1,600 and 1,700 miles,\r\n  with the same stock of coals, came very near this distance. It\r\n  must be observed that westerly gales blew almost all the year\r\n  round across the Atlantic. They were produced by the trade winds\r\n  being the compensating cause that restored the balance which these\r\n  served to destroy, according to that beautiful principle in nature\r\n  which always provides a remedy for any derangement in the deranging\r\n  cause itself. As a last resource, however, should the distance\r\n  between Valentia and St. John’s prove too great, they might make\r\n  the Azores a stage between, so that there remained no doubt of\r\n  the practicability of establishing a steam intercourse with the\r\n  United States. As to the project, however, which was announced\r\n  in the newspapers, of making the voyage directly from New York\r\n  to Liverpool, it was, he had no hesitation in saying, perfectly\r\n  chimerical, and they might as well talk of making a voyage from New\r\n  York or Liverpool to the moon. The vessels which would ultimately\r\n  be found the best adapted for the voyage between this country and\r\n  the United States would be those of 800 tons, which would carry\r\n  machines of 200 horse-power, and would be able to stow 400 tons of\r\n  coal. To supply a 10 horse-power daily required an expenditure of\r\n  a ton of coals, and, consequently, 200 horse-power would require\r\n  20 tons of coal daily; but if the vessel carried 400 tons of coal\r\n  only, it would not be practicable to undertake a voyage which would\r\n  require the whole of the quantity. They must make an allowance of\r\n  100 tons for contingencies. Thus, in reckoning the average length\r\n  of the voyage which might be undertaken by such a vessel, we might\r\n  safely calculate upon 300 tons of coal, which would be sufficient\r\n  for 15 days, and it might fairly be concluded that any project\r\n  which calculated upon making longer voyages than 15 days without\r\n  taking in a fresh supply of coals, in the present state of the\r\n  steamboat, must be considered chimerical. Now, the average rate of\r\n  speed of the Mediterranean packets was 170 miles per day, and the\r\n  utmost limit of a steam voyage might be taken at 2,550 miles; but\r\n  even that could not be reckoned upon.”\r\n\r\nIn justice to the memory of Dr. Lardner, it is only fair to state\r\nthat, in the eighth edition of his “Steam Engine, &c.,” 1851, pp.\r\n294-309, he denies that he ever stated that “a steam voyage across\r\nthe Atlantic was a physical impossibility.”\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1832-3, the Quebec and Halifax Steam Navigation\r\nCo. built at Quebec a steamer, which they named the ROYAL WILLIAM.\r\nShe was a vessel of 1,370 tons B.M.; length over all, 176 feet;\r\nbreadth, outside paddle-boxes, 43 feet 10 inches; inside, 27 feet;\r\ndepth of hold, 17 feet 9 inches; draught laden, 13 feet. Her\r\nengines of 180 h.p., constructed in Birmingham by Boulton & Watt,\r\nwere forwarded to Canada, and fitted on board the ROYAL WILLIAM\r\nat Montreal, whither she had been towed by the steamboat BRITISH\r\nAMERICA. After trading for several months between Quebec and Pictou,\r\nNova Scotia, the station for which her owners had built her, she was\r\nadvertised to sail for London. In accordance with this announcement\r\nshe was despatched from Quebec on the 5th August, 1833, and after\r\ncalling at Pictou, N.S., where she took on board a further supply of\r\ncoal at 15s. per chaldron, she proceeded direct to Cowes, Isle of\r\nWight, accomplishing the voyage of about 2,500 miles in seventeen\r\ndays. This voyage is remarkable as being the first instance of a\r\nvessel crossing the Atlantic from America by the use of steam only.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of her trans-Atlantic voyage, the ROYAL WILLIAM\r\nwas sold to the Spanish Government, who changed her name to the\r\nYSABEL SECUNDA, and fitted her up as a man-of-war carrying six guns.\r\nShe took part in the first Carlist war and, finally, was totally\r\nwrecked on the rocks off the harbour of Santander, Spain.\r\n\r\nAfter strenuous and prolonged efforts, Dr. Julius Smith succeeded\r\nin organising (1836) a Transatlantic Steamship Company, bearing the\r\ntitle of the British Queen Steam Navigation Co. The capital of the\r\nCompany was fixed at £1,000,000 sterling, and its secretary was the\r\ncelebrated Mr. MacGregor Laird. The shares were promptly subscribed\r\nfor, and the Directors placed a contract with Messrs. Curling and\r\nYoung, Blackwall, London, to build their pioneer steamship, the\r\nBRITISH QUEEN. The order for the engines was placed with a Glasgow\r\nfirm, Messrs. Claude Girdwood & Co. This firm, however, before\r\nthey had finished the work entrusted to them, became bankrupt, and\r\na new contract was made with Mr. Robert Napier, the famous Clyde\r\nengineer, to supply the engines. It was at first the intention of\r\nthe Directors (as stated in their prospectus) to build a vessel\r\nof 1,862 tons burthen, but before the completion of the ship they\r\ndecided to increase her size to 2,400 tons. Although contracted for\r\nin the summer of 1836, it was not until 24th May, 1838, that the\r\nBRITISH QUEEN was launched. This unfortunate delay, caused by the\r\nbankruptcy of Messrs. Girdwood & Co., enabled a rival company at\r\nBristol to build and equip their steamer, the GREAT WESTERN, before\r\nthe BRITISH QUEEN could be got ready for her service. In order to\r\nsave the prestige of their Company the Directors of the BRITISH\r\nQUEEN chartered from the St. George Steam-Packet Co. the steamer\r\nSIRIUS, and advertised that she “would leave London for New York on\r\nWednesday, the 28th of March, 1838, calling at Cork Harbour; and\r\nwould start from thence on the 2nd April, returning from New York\r\non the 1st of May.”[17] The sailing from Cork Harbour was, however,\r\ndelayed, waiting the arrival of the steampacket OCEAN from Liverpool\r\nwith the mails and passengers, until the morning of the 4th of April.\r\nShe started on this memorable voyage at 9 o’clock on the morning\r\nof the date named, having on board 94 cabin passengers. Three days\r\nlater (7th April, 1838)[18] she was followed across the Atlantic\r\nby the GREAT WESTERN, from Bristol for New York, with goods and\r\npassengers. As the dates of the intended sailings of both steamers\r\nhad been conveyed to New York, their arrival at that port was eagerly\r\nlooked for. They both arrived on the same day, the SIRIUS early in\r\nthe morning of Monday, the 23rd April, and the GREAT WESTERN in the\r\nafternoon. The excitement which prevailed on the arrival of these\r\nsteamers was described as follows by the New York Press: —\r\n\r\n  “At 3 o’clock p.m. on Sunday, the 22nd of April, the SIRIUS first\r\n  descried the land, and early on Monday morning, the 23rd, anchored\r\n  in the North River immediately off the Battery. Nothing could\r\n  exceed the excitement. The river was covered during the whole day\r\n  with row-boats, skiffs, and yawls, carrying the wondering people\r\n  out to get a close view of this extraordinary vessel. While people\r\n  were yet wondering how the SIRIUS so successfully made out to cross\r\n  the rude Atlantic, it was announced about 11 a.m. on Monday, from\r\n  the telegraph, that a huge steamship was in the offing. ‘The GREAT\r\n  WESTERN!—the GREAT WESTERN!’ was on everybody’s tongue. About 2\r\n  o’clock p.m. the first curl of her ascending smoke fell on the eyes\r\n  of the thousands of anxious spectators, and a shout of enthusiasm\r\n  rose on the air.... Thus the grand experiment has been fairly and\r\n  fully tested, and has been completely successful. The only question\r\n  now in the case is that of expense. Can steampackets be made to\r\n  pay?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH & AFRICAN S. N. CO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH & IRISH STEAMPACKET CO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH INDIA S. N.

HARRISON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED HOLT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL HOUGH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOULDER BROS.]\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of her voyage westwards, the SIRIUS experienced\r\nstrong head winds, during which she only steamed 4 to 5 knots per\r\nhour. During the latter portion, the weather was favourable, and she\r\nmade good progress, averaging 9½ knots. She sailed from New York\r\nas advertised on the 1st of May, and reached England on the 18th\r\nidem after a voyage of sixteen days. The GREAT WESTERN left New\r\nYork on the 7th of May and arrived at Bristol on the 22nd, being\r\nfourteen days on the passage. There was a remarkable difference in\r\nher consumption of coal on the two voyages, accounted for, probably,\r\nfirst by the stormy weather referred to as experienced by the SIRIUS\r\non her outward voyage, and secondly by the prevailing westerly winds\r\non the homeward run. On the voyage Bristol to New York, the GREAT\r\nWESTERN averaged per day 208 knots, or 8·2 knots per hour, with a\r\ntotal consumption of 655 tons of coal. On her homeward voyage she\r\naveraged 213 knots per day, or nearly 9 knots per hour, with a total\r\nconsumption of only 392 tons of coal. Fuller details of the SIRIUS\r\nwill be found in the History of the Cork Steamship Co. in Part II.\r\nof this work. It is but fair to state that she was only half the\r\nsize, and had only half the power of her famous rival. The principal\r\ndimensions of the two vessels were as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                              Gross\r\n                 Length.  Breadth.  Depth.   Tonnage. Engines.\r\n  GREAT WESTERN   236 ft.  35·4 ft.  23·3 ft.  1340   750 h.p.\r\n  SIRIUS          178 ft.  25·6 ft.  18 ft.     703   320 h.p.\r\n\r\nThey were both paddle-steamers, built of wood, the former designed by\r\nBrunel, and engined by Maudsley, Sons & Field, and the latter built\r\nby Menzies, of Leith, and engined by Wingate & Co., of Glasgow. For\r\nupwards of eight years the GREAT WESTERN continued to sail regularly\r\nbetween Bristol and New York, on which station she was very popular\r\nwith passengers. She was sold in 1847 to the Royal Mail Steampacket\r\nCo., in which service she was also a favourite for several years. In\r\n1857 it was the opinion of the Directors that she could not compete\r\nprofitably with modern boats, and she was therefore broken up at\r\nVauxhall.\r\n\r\nAbout the date of the despatch of the SIRIUS from Cork, the Directors\r\nof the City of Dublin Steam Packet Co. had under consideration the\r\nformation of a Transatlantic Steam-Packet Co., with sailings to\r\nand from Liverpool. The steamers of this Company were amongst the\r\nlargest and most famous afloat. A meeting of Directors was held in\r\nthe Committee Room, Water Street, Liverpool, at which it was decided\r\nto open up the new service by the despatch of the P.S. ROYAL WILLIAM\r\nas soon as she could be got ready for the voyage. The ROYAL WILLIAM\r\nwas practically a new steamer, having been built in 1836, being\r\none of four steamers built to compete with the Admiralty steamers\r\nfor the mail service between Liverpool and Kingstown. She proved\r\nherself to be faster than any of the Government mail steamers, and\r\nwhen placed on the Dublin and London station, made a passage from\r\nFalmouth to Kingstown, 260 miles, in 23 hours. She was built by\r\nWilson, of Liverpool, and engined by Fawcett & Preston, of the same\r\ncity. Her length was 175 feet (being 3 feet less than the SIRIUS),\r\nbeam 27 feet, depth of hold 17 feet 6 inches. Her capacity was 817\r\ntons burden, and she was propelled by engines of 276 h.p. Her coal\r\nconsumption was about 17 tons per 24 hours, and in fairly smooth\r\nwater her speed was 11½ knots per hour. She had cabin accommodation\r\nfor eighty passengers. She sailed from the Prince’s Pier on Thursday\r\nevening, 5th July, 1838, having on board thirty-two passengers.\r\nSixty-four years afterwards the present author had several interviews\r\nwith Mr. Brownrigg, the City of Dublin Co.’s Customs Clerk, who took\r\nout the Customs clearance for the ROYAL WILLIAM, and who in spite of\r\nhis great age remembered clearly the appearance of the vessel as she\r\nsteamed down the River Mersey on that midsummer evening so long ago.\r\nAlthough she carried no cargo on that voyage, she was so deeply laden\r\nwith coal for fuel—coal that filled her bunkers, her holds, and even\r\nher well-deck—that her paddles were buried six feet, her sponsons\r\nwere submerged, and it was possible by leaning over the bulwarks to\r\nwash one’s hands in the water that surged at the vessel’s sides.\r\nNaturally it was an event in which the townspeople of Liverpool and\r\nthe residents on the Cheshire side of the river took the deepest\r\ninterest. As she began to move she was greeted with enthusiastic\r\ncheers from thousands of spectators who crowded the piers and lined\r\nthe river side, whilst cannon were fired from Woodside, Monks Ferry,\r\nRock Ferry, and from the steamboats on the river. The ROYAL WILLIAM\r\ncompleted the passage from Liverpool to New York in nineteen days,\r\nand the homeward passage in fourteen and a half days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROYAL WILLIAM P. S. in Mid-Atlantic, 12th July, 1838.]\r\n\r\nAmongst those who were present at the meeting held in the Water\r\nStreet Committee Room was Sir John Tobin, who had a large steamer\r\nnearing completion on the stocks. It was agreed that this vessel\r\nshould sail alternately with the ROYAL WILLIAM between Liverpool\r\nand New York. At her launch, Sir John Tobin’s steamer was named\r\nthe LIVERPOOL. She was a vessel of 1,150 tons, with engines of 404\r\nh.p. She started on her first voyage on the 20th October, 1838,\r\nbut experienced such bad weather that she put back to Cork on the\r\n26th, after having accomplished about one-third of her voyage. She\r\nremained at Cork for ten days, and again proceeded to sea on the\r\n6th November, arriving at New York on the 23rd, after a passage of\r\nsixteen and a half days. It was on board this steamer that Mr. Samuel\r\nCunard crossed the Atlantic, for the purpose of inducing British\r\ncapitalists to take up his scheme of mail steamers between Liverpool,\r\nHalifax and Boston.\r\n\r\nAfter making a few voyages to and from Liverpool and New York, the\r\nLIVERPOOL was lengthened, her capacity being increased by 393 tons,\r\nand at the same time her name was changed to the GREAT LIVERPOOL. Her\r\nnew owners, the P. and O. Co., employed her in their mail service\r\nbetween Southampton and Alexandria. Her career as a Royal Mail\r\nsteamer was a short one, as she was lost off Cape Finisterre on the\r\n4th February, 1846.\r\n\r\nThe first great disaster in the Transatlantic steamship trade\r\noccurred in the spring of 1841. On the 12th March of that year, the\r\nsteamship PRESIDENT sailed from New York, bound for Liverpool, with a\r\nfull list of passengers. She was a new steamer, having been launched\r\nfifteen months previously (7th December, 1839) by Messrs. Curling &\r\nYoung for account of the British and American Steam Navigation Co.,\r\nof Bristol. The PRESIDENT was one of the largest and most powerful\r\nsteamships of her day, her register tonnage being 2,366 tons, and\r\nher engines indicated 540 horse-power. On her first voyage, she\r\nsailed from Liverpool for New York at 2 p.m. on the 1st August,\r\n1840, arrived at New York 2 p.m. on the 17th idem; sailed from New\r\nYork 2 p.m. on the 1st September, and arrived at Liverpool 2 p.m.\r\non the 17th of the same month, being exactly sixteen days on both\r\nher westward and her eastward passage. She apparently lay up for\r\nthe winter, and resumed her sailings in the spring of the following\r\nyear. She left New York for Liverpool on her third homeward voyage on\r\nthe 12th March, 1841, having on board 136 passengers. After leaving\r\nNew York she disappeared, with all her living freight, from human\r\nken. As day after day passed, the utmost anxiety arose, both in the\r\nmercantile world and amongst the relatives of the passengers and\r\nseamen, as to the cause of her detention. Other steamers and ships\r\nreported very heavy weather in the Atlantic, and the presence of\r\nunusual quantities of ice in very low latitudes. The newspapers\r\nof the period were filled with references to the ill-fated vessel,\r\nwith suggestions that her engines had broken down, and that she had\r\ndrifted out of the track of homeward bound steamers. Multitudinous\r\nand conflicting rumours passed into circulation of her wreck having\r\nbeen seen in various places, and a thousand speculations as to the\r\ncause and certainty of a catastrophe, and the subsequent fate of\r\nthose on board, kept alive the agony of those interested in her. Her\r\nfate remains one of the sad mysteries of the ocean, as no trace of\r\nher wreck was ever discovered, nor a single survivor from the tragedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New Brighton Lighthouse River Mersey]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] The “Annals of Liverpool” section in “Gore’s Directory”\r\nerroneously states: “1838. The steamship SIRIUS sailed from London to\r\nCork, 27th March, and from Cork to New York, 2nd April.”\r\n\r\n[18] This date is incorrectly quoted in “Gore’s Liverpool Directory”\r\nas the 8th April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Cunard’s tender for the carriage of the British and North\r\n  American Mails accepted, 1839.—GREAT BRITAIN launched, 1843.—Sails\r\n  from Bristol for London, 23rd January, 1845.—Visited by H.M.

From Mr. Melville\r\nhe received a letter of introduction to Mr. Robert Napier, the\r\ncelebrated Clyde engineer and shipbuilder, by whom he was introduced\r\nto Mr. George Burns, of Glasgow, and Mr. David MacIver, of Liverpool.\r\nBoth these gentlemen favourably regarded the proposals of Mr. Cunard,\r\nand interested themselves so energetically in the matter that in a\r\nvery short time the whole of the requisite capital for the formation\r\nof the Trans-Atlantic Mail Steamship Company was subscribed. A sketch\r\nof the history of this famous Company (afterwards known as the Cunard\r\nCompany) will be found in the second part of this volume.\r\n\r\nAlthough the BRITISH QUEEN had proved an entire success, and was a\r\ngreat favourite with transatlantic travellers, her owners resolved\r\nto build a second ship, which would not only exceed her in size,\r\nbut which should also include all the latest improvements the art\r\nof naval construction could then command. This was the famous GREAT\r\nBRITAIN. She was the first Western Ocean steamship constructed of\r\niron, and the first and only one for several years that was propelled\r\nby a screw propeller instead of paddle-wheels. She was considered\r\na colossal steamer in her time, and excited quite as much public\r\ninterest as did the GREAT EASTERN at a later period. Her principal\r\ndimensions were, length of keel 289 feet, between perpendiculars\r\n296 feet, over all 322 feet, her breadth was 51 feet, depth of hold\r\n32 feet 6 inches, her measurement 2,984 tons, and her engines 1,000\r\nh.p. She originally carried six masts, two of which were forward\r\nand four aft of the funnel. She was built at Bristol, from plans\r\nfurnished by Mr. Patterson of that City, who also had designed\r\nthe GREAT WESTERN. Her engines and boilers were constructed in,\r\nand fitted on board the vessel at, the Company’s own works, as no\r\noutside engineers would undertake the contract. But, owing to an\r\nextraordinary oversight on the part of the consulting Engineer, it\r\nwas then found that she was imprisoned in the dock, being so deeply\r\nimmersed by the weight of her machinery as to be unable to pass out.\r\nAlthough she was launched on the 19th July, 1843, owing to the above\r\nunfortunate mistake, she was not ready for sea until December of the\r\nfollowing year. On her passage from Bristol to London she encountered\r\na severe storm which thoroughly tested her seagoing qualities, and\r\nthrough which she passed triumphantly. Her arrival in the Thames was\r\nawaited with great interest by the public, whose curiosity had been\r\nexcited by the numerous references to the vessel published in the\r\ndaily and illustrated papers. A long and interesting account of this\r\ntrial voyage, from which the following particulars are taken, was\r\npublished in the “Illustrated London News,” under date of the 1st\r\nFebruary, 1845. From this article it appears that the GREAT BRITAIN\r\nleft Bristol for London at 7 p.m. on Thursday, 23rd January, 1845.\r\nAt the time the ship got under weigh, it was blowing a fresh breeze\r\nfrom the S.S.W., which at 3 a.m. on Friday had veered to the N.W.\r\nand increased to a gale, and there was a counter swell from the\r\nIrish Channel, causing a disagreeable and heavy cross sea. The\r\ngale continued to increase, and was for a considerable time on her\r\nstarboard bow; yet, notwithstanding this, in the face of the gale,\r\nand a heavy head sea with a strong ebb tide, she made five and a half\r\nknots per hour. At twenty minutes past twelve, when about fifteen\r\nmiles to the westward of Lundy, she was struck on the starboard bow\r\nby a tremendous sea, which must have contained two or three thousand\r\ntons of water. The shock for a moment seemed to paralyse the vessel\r\nand to bring her to a standstill; this, however, was but for one\r\nmoment; the vessel recovered the shock instanter, and continued to\r\nbrave the gale as though nothing had happened to check her progress.\r\nSome idea of the force of the concussion may be formed from the\r\ndamage done to the vessel. Three of her starboard bulls eyes were\r\nstove in, together with their frames, the diagonal bends of her\r\nforecastle deck were bent, the woodwork started two inches upwards,\r\na portion of the carved figurehead carried away, also the wooden\r\nfittings of her bulkhead, the iron sheathing of both bows split\r\nabove deck in two places. The gale continued until 5-30 p.m., when\r\nit became more moderate. At 8-45 p.m. the GREAT BRITAIN rounded the\r\nLand’s End, and at 10-40 was off the Lizard proceeding up the Channel\r\nat the rate of 10½ knots per hour. The Captain (Lieut. Hoskin, R.N.),\r\nwas of opinion that neither the GREAT WESTERN, nor any other Royal\r\nMail (Paddle) Steamer, could have made such headway under the same\r\ncircumstances by at least from one to one and a half knots per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT BRITAIN S.S. (1845), from an old Engraving.]\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, 25th January, at 12-10 a.m., she was abreast of\r\nFalmouth, and proceeded up channel, with light winds from the S.W.\r\nat an average speed of 12 knots per hour. At 12-45 p.m. she entered\r\nthe Needles passage, and when off Cowes, at 2-15, the engines were\r\nstopped to land despatches. At 2-18 again proceeded on her course.\r\nUpon arriving at Spithead, Captain Hoskin took his vessel under the\r\nstern of H.M.S. APOLLO, fired a gun, and gave her three cheers, which\r\nwere returned by the crew and troops on board. At 1-40 a.m. on Sunday\r\n(26th), the GREAT BRITAIN came to an anchor in the Downs, having ran\r\nfrom the time she rounded the Land’s End, three hundred and fifty\r\nmiles at an average speed of twelve knots per hour.\r\n\r\nAt 7-45 a.m. the vessel was got under weigh again from the Downs, and\r\nupon rounding the North Foreland, and steering through the Queen’s\r\nChannel, encountered a stiff gale from the W.N.W. The GREAT BRITAIN,\r\nhowever, met it in gallant style, and made nine and a half knots\r\nagainst it. As she steamed up the river, the crews of every vessel\r\nshe passed ran on deck to obtain a view of her, her great length, and\r\nher singular appearance with six masts, rendering her an object of\r\nconsiderable attraction. She arrived at Woolwich at 3-30 p.m., and\r\nat Blackwall a few minutes later. At both these places there was an\r\nimmense concourse of people assembled to witness her arrival.\r\n\r\nShe remained at her anchorage at Blackwall nearly five months, during\r\nwhich period she was inspected by many thousands of the public. On\r\nthe 22nd April H.M. Queen Victoria, accompanied by Prince Albert and\r\nsuite, paid her a visit.\r\n\r\nThe GREAT BRITAIN left Blackwall on Thursday afternoon, 12th June,\r\n1845. On passing Woolwich it seemed as if the whole population had\r\nturned out to behold her. The Dockyard was lined with the Naval\r\nand Military officers connected with that depôt, whose cheers were\r\nloud and continued. She had on board about eighty passengers, who\r\nhad embarked for a trip round the coast. After calling at several\r\nports she arrived in the Mersey about 9 o’clock on the evening of\r\nThursday, 3rd July, on which occasion she was anxiously looked for\r\nby thousands, the pierheads and every available point on the river\r\nbeing densely crowded. The GREAT BRITAIN sailed on her first voyage\r\nfrom Liverpool to New York on Saturday, 26th July, at 3 o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon, taking forty-five passengers, and arrived out on\r\nthe 10th August, at noon. On her return voyage she left New York\r\non the 30th August, having on board fifty-seven passengers and 600\r\ntons general cargo, and arrived at Liverpool on the 15th September,\r\nat 8 a.m. She continued to trade regularly between the two ports,\r\nher passenger list steadily increasing, until the 22nd September,\r\n1846, when she stranded in Dundrum Bay, Ireland. She was, at the\r\ntime of the stranding, on a voyage from Liverpool to New York with\r\n185 passengers. Fortunately the mishap was accompanied by no loss\r\nof life. The cause of the disaster is explained by the following\r\nresolution passed by the Directors of the Company:—“With respect\r\nto the occurrences which preceded the stranding of the unfortunate\r\nship, as explained now by Captain Hoskin, and by the Report of\r\nCaptain Claxton to the Secretary, the Directors are of opinion that\r\nthe ship was stranded in consequence of an error in judgment, into\r\nwhich it appears the Captain was betrayed through the omission of a\r\nnotice of St. John’s light in the chart of this year, by which he\r\nwas navigating, and of the want of knowledge on his part of such a\r\nlight having been established, it being to the Directors obvious that\r\nhad the light been laid, Captain Hoskin would have known that the\r\njudgment which led him at 8 o’clock to put his ship in the proper\r\ncourse for the North Channel, ought to have been persevered in.”\r\n\r\nThe GREAT BRITAIN remained stranded for over eleven months, but on\r\nthe 25th August, 1847, she was floated off and towed to Liverpool\r\nfor repairs. After the completion of the repairs she lay in the\r\nLiverpool Dock for about five years, and then made one trip to New\r\nYork, sailing from Liverpool on the 1st May, 1852. She sailed from\r\nNew York on the 5th June, and after a rapid passage of 10 days 23\r\nhours arrived in Liverpool on the 16th of that month. From that date\r\nshe ceased to be connected with the Transatlantic Trade, and her\r\nsubsequent history is sketched in the chapter devoted to the account\r\nof steam communication with Australia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailboat near land]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  Steam communication with the West Indies.—Royal Mail Steampacket\r\n  Co. incorporated 1841.—Commences with a fleet of fourteen\r\n  steamers.—Heavy loss of first year’s working.—Generous concession\r\n  from Government.—Rapid increase of trade.—The “TRENT affair.”—First\r\n  screw steamers for Company, the TAGUS and MOZELLE.—The\r\n  TASMANIAN.—Gross tonnage of present fleet.—The Imperial Direct West\r\n  India Mail Service, Ltd., established 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\nNine months after the despatch of the first Cunarder from Liverpool\r\nto Halifax, the Admiralty accepted a contract from a newly-formed\r\nsteampacket company, to convey the mails between England, the West\r\nIndies, and the Gulf of Mexico. This company, which bore the title\r\nof The Royal Mail Steam Packet Co., had an authorised capital of\r\n£1,500,000, in fifteen thousand shares of £100 each. It commenced\r\noperations on an exceptionally large scale, no less than fourteen\r\nlarge and powerful steamers being at once ordered to be built for\r\nthe service. The steamers were to be each of 400 horse-power, and\r\nto be capable of carrying guns of the largest calibre then in use\r\non H.M. war steamers. Like all other ocean steamers of the period,\r\nthey were constructed of wood, and were propelled by paddle-wheels.\r\nUpon the complete delivery of these vessels to the Company, the\r\ncontract required one of them to sail twice in each calendar month\r\nfrom England via Corunna and Madeira to the various islands in the\r\nWest Indies, specified in the contract, and back “to such port in\r\nthe British Channel as the said Commissioners of the Admiralty shall\r\ndirect.” The scheme also embraced other places in the West Indies,\r\nthe Spanish Main, and the United States, for which mails were to be\r\ncarried. For the performance of these services, the Company was to\r\nreceive a subsidy at the rate of £240,000 per annum in quarterly\r\npayments, the contract to commence on the 1st December, 1841, or if\r\npossible earlier, and to continue in force for ten years, subject\r\nto twelve months’ notice from either party for its termination.\r\nNotwithstanding this large subsidy, the operations of the Company\r\nduring the first year resulted in a heavy loss, the Directors’\r\nbalance-sheet, presented at the first meeting of the shareholders,\r\nshowing a deficit of £79,790 16s. 8d. Before this meeting was held,\r\none-half of the capital had been paid up, and another call of £10\r\nper share was sanctioned at the meeting; but as it was found that\r\neven this was insufficient for the requirements of the Company, the\r\nDirectors appealed to Government for further assistance. In response\r\nto this appeal the Government generously consented to reduce the\r\nannual mileage to be traversed by the Company’s ships, which by the\r\noriginal contract was 684,816 miles, to 392,976 miles, without any\r\nreduction of the annual subsidy of £240,000. This liberal concession\r\nwas estimated by the Directors to effect a saving to the Company\r\nof £125,000 per annum. Unfortunately during the second year of its\r\nexistence, the Company lost two valuable steamers, which more than\r\ncounterbalanced the bonus it had obtained from Government. Trade,\r\nhowever, increased so rapidly and profitably, that in the following\r\nyear (1843) the Company had recouped its losses, and had a surplus\r\nof receipts over expenditure amounting to £94,210, and in 1844 to\r\n£147,749.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the Government made a fresh contract with the Royal Mail\r\nSteam Packet Co. for a further term of ten years from the 1st\r\nJanuary, 1852, the subsidy being raised to £270,000 per annum, but\r\nthe Company were required to undertake the additional expense of a\r\nmonthly service to the Brazils, which increased the mileage to be\r\nperformed annually from 389,448 to 547,296 miles, and at the same\r\ntime reduced the mileage from 12s. 3d. to 9s. 10d. per mile. The\r\nCompany was also required to increase the speed of its steamers on\r\nthe West Indian line from 8 knots to 10 knots per hour, and to add\r\nfive new steamers to its fleet, each of 2,250 tons burden and 800\r\nhorse power. This second contract was altered in 1857, and its period\r\nof currency extended two years, one condition introduced being of\r\nan extraordinary nature. It had reference to an amalgamation with\r\nthe European and Australian Mail Company, for the conveyance of the\r\nmails via Egypt, to and from Australia. This arrangement proved a\r\ngreat failure, owing to the complete collapse of the latter Company.\r\nA second condition required the acceleration of the mails between\r\nEngland and Rio de Janeiro. The Company was also required to provide\r\nthree new steamers of 3,000 tons burden and 800 horse-power for the\r\nAtlantic West India service, and a fourth of smaller dimensions to\r\nply between Rio and the River Plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLYDE. Royal Mail Steampacket Co.]\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the second contract expired, and fresh arrangements were\r\nmade, reducing the annual subsidy to £172,914. At the same time it\r\nwas stipulated that the speed of the steamers in the West India\r\nTransatlantic service should be increased to 10½ knots per hour.\r\n\r\nThe postal contract was again renewed in 1874; but in consequence of\r\nadverse articles and letters which had appeared in the public press,\r\nand because several members of Parliament had insisted that the\r\nservice should be thrown open to public competition, the Directors\r\nof the Royal Mail Steam-Packet Co. found themselves compelled either\r\nto abandon the service altogether, or to accept a much smaller\r\nsubsidy than they had hitherto received for carrying the mails.\r\nThey adopted the latter alternative, and undertook the conveyance of\r\nthe West India mails for an annual payment of £84,750—being about\r\none-third of the amount of the first subsidy. The company in addition\r\nreceived the sum of £2,000 per annum to cover the cost of the\r\nsteamers calling at Plymouth to land the mails instead of carrying\r\nthem on to Southampton, the final port of destination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NILE. Royal Mail Steampacket Co.]\r\n\r\nOn and from the 1st of January, 1875, the mails were carried on\r\nan entirely fresh basis. The contract with the Government was for\r\na service twice a month from Southampton: payment to be according\r\nto the weight of postal matter conveyed by the steamers, and the\r\ncontract was terminable by six months’ notice given by either party\r\nto the contract.\r\n\r\nAlthough on the North Atlantic screw steamers had been employed\r\nin rapidly increasing numbers since 1850, it was not until twenty\r\nyears later that the Directors of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Co.\r\nsubstituted screw steamers for paddle-wheel steam packets in their\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe first fleet of the Company consisted of vessels built of wood,\r\nbut so indeed were the pioneer steamers of the Cunard, P. & O.,\r\nand other historical steamship companies. The course taken by the\r\nCompany’s vessels was free from the dangers from ice and fogs, such\r\nas are encountered by steamers engaged in the North Atlantic trades,\r\nyet during the first eight years of the Company’s operations it lost\r\nno fewer than six of its steamers. The ISIS struck on a reef off the\r\ncoast of Bermuda and sank on the 8th October, 1842. The SOLWAY was\r\nlost 20 miles west of Corunna on the 15th April, 1843. The MEDINA was\r\nwrecked on a coral reef near Turk’s Island on the 12th May, 1844. The\r\nTWEED was totally lost on the 12th February, 1847; and in 1849, the\r\nFORTH was wrecked on the same reefs that had caused the destruction\r\nof the TWEED. The ACTÆON was lost in 1850 on a shoal near Carthagena;\r\nand in 1852 there was lost by fire the AMAZON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. PORT ANTONIO leaving Avonmouth for Kingston,\r\nJamaica.]\r\n\r\nAn event occurred on the 8th November, 1861, which occasioned\r\nconsiderable public excitement, both in Great Britain and in the\r\nU.S.A. It was during the struggle between the Northern and Southern\r\nStates, and two of the Commissioners of the Confederate States were\r\nforcibly removed from the Royal Mail steamer TRENT, while on their\r\nway to Europe, by the officers and crew of the Federal man-of-war\r\nSAN JACINTO. This high-handed action, which was not repudiated by\r\nthe Federal Government, was inexcusable, and the tone adopted by a\r\ngreat portion of the press of the Northern States was ludicrous, and\r\nunworthy of a great people.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 there was launched from the yard of Messrs. John Elder & Co.\r\ntwo splendid screw steamers to the order of the Royal Mail Co. These\r\nsteamers were the TAGUS and the MOZELLE, both steamers being 3,252\r\ntons gross register and 600 nominal horse-power. On her official\r\ntrial trip the TAGUS attained an average mean speed of 14·878 knots\r\nper hour, a result which was slightly surpassed by her sister ship\r\nthe MOZELLE, the average mean speed of the latter on her trial trip\r\nbeing 14·929 knots per hour.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Messrs. Elder & Co. effected an extraordinary\r\nimprovement in the TASMANIAN, an iron screw steamer the Royal Mail\r\nCo. had purchased from the unfortunate European and Australian Steam\r\nNavigation Co. This vessel was fitted with compound engines, and on\r\nher first voyage afterwards from Southampton to St. Thomas, occupying\r\n14 days 2 hours, she consumed 466 tons of coal, against her former\r\nconsumption of 1,088 tons on a voyage occupying 14 days 13 hours.\r\n\r\nSince that date all the additions to the Company’s fleet have been\r\nscrew steamers, and it now (1903) consists of 22 ocean steamers,\r\nwith a gross tonnage of 87,855 tons, in addition to 9 coast steamers\r\nemployed as feeders to the mail services.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the present century, Messrs. Elder, Dempster\r\n& Co. established a service of mail steamers between Bristol and\r\nJamaica. A detailed account of this service, which is known as the\r\nImperial Direct West India Mail Service, Limited, will be found in\r\nthe second part of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nInternational rivalry in the Transatlantic.—The Collins Line and the\r\nCunard Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor upwards of nine years Great Britain had held a monopoly of the\r\ntransatlantic steamship business. America could and did build sailing\r\nvessels that were unsurpassed by those belonging to any other nation;\r\nher Baltimore clippers, Boston packets, and New York liners were all\r\nof them vessels of the highest class and reputation. But apparently\r\nAmericans could neither build, nor own ocean steamers that were\r\ncapable of successfully competing with British owned steamships.\r\nAt least, it is a matter of history that from 1838 to 1847 all the\r\nsteamships that crossed the North Atlantic sailed under the British\r\nflag, with one exception.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th September, 1845, Messrs. Forbes & Co. despatched from New\r\nYork their auxiliary steamship MASSACHUSETTS. She was practically\r\na full-rigged ship, 751 tons O.M., fitted with an engine of 170\r\nhorse-power. This engine had two cylinders each 3 feet stroke and\r\n26 inches diameter. Steam was generated in two “waggon boilers,”\r\neach 14 feet long, 7 feet wide and 9 feet high. Her propeller was\r\nmade of composition metal, and could be raised out of the water when\r\nnot required. Her engine room, boilers, bunkers, &c., were situated\r\nin the lower after hold, and occupied a space equal to one-tenth\r\nof the cubic capacity of the ship. Her engines were capable of\r\ndriving her in smooth water at the rate of about 8 knots per hour,\r\non a consumption of 9 tons anthracite coal per 24 hours. The length\r\nof the MASSACHUSETTS was 161 feet, her beam 31 feet 9 inches, and\r\nher depth of hold 20 feet. She had a full poop, extending to the\r\nmainmast (and consequently forward of the funnel), in which there\r\nwas accommodation for 35 first-class passengers. Her entire cost\r\nwith machinery complete in all respects was £16,000. She made two\r\nround voyages between New York and Liverpool, and in June, 1846,\r\nwas chartered to the U.S. Government to carry troops to the Gulf\r\nof Mexico. The Government were so well pleased with her that they\r\nafterwards purchased her, and she took part in the siege of Vera\r\nCruz. Subsequently her name was changed to the FARRALONES, and she\r\ncontinued in the U.S. Navy until about 1870, when she was again sold.\r\nHer new owners removed her machinery and renamed her the ALASKA.\r\n\r\nObviously the MASSACHUSETTS was not intended to compete against\r\nfull-powered ocean steamships, and it was not until 1847 that the\r\nfirst American line of steamers to Europe was established. This was\r\na line of steamships to run between New York and Bremen, calling\r\nat Southampton. The pioneer steamer of the line, the WASHINGTON,\r\nsailed on her first voyage from New York for Southampton on the\r\nsame day (June, 1847) that the BRITANNIA, belonging to the Cunard\r\nCompany, sailed for Liverpool. This was the first ocean race between\r\nAmerican and British steamships. Theoretically the American steamer\r\nwas incomparably superior to the other. She was much larger and had\r\ndouble the power; she was new, while her rival had been buffeted\r\nby the Atlantic billows for seven years. Quoth the editor of the\r\n“New York Herald”: “We have to say that if the BRITANNIA beats the\r\nWASHINGTON over (and they both, we understand, start the same day),\r\nshe will have to run by the deep mines, and put in more coal.” The\r\nBRITANNIA did not “run by the deep mines and put in more coal,” but\r\nshe won the race by two full days.\r\n\r\nGreat pressure was subsequently brought to bear on Congress in order\r\nto obtain a subsidy for an American mail service to Great Britain.\r\nThose in favour of the subsidy argued that it was humiliating\r\nto their pride as a great maritime people, that foreigners and\r\ncommercial rivals should wrest from them the virtual monopoly\r\nof ocean steam conveyance, especially between the United States\r\nand Europe, and they complained that the ocean mails along their\r\nsouthern coasts had been placed in the hands of foreign carriers,\r\nsustained and protected by the British Government under the forms of\r\ncontract to carry the British mails; while the Cunard Line, between\r\nLiverpool and Boston, via Halifax, constituted the only medium of\r\nregular steam navigation between the United States and Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITANNIA. Cunard Steamship Co.]\r\n\r\nIt may be appropriate to state here, that in addition to carrying the\r\nBritish mails from Liverpool to North America, the Cunard Company,\r\nearly in 1850, obtained a contract from the British Government for\r\nthe conveyance of the mails between Halifax, New York and Bermuda.\r\nThe steam packets employed in this service were the ALPHA, BETA\r\nand DELTA, small vessels each of 350 tons and 80 horse-power, and\r\nfitted with a proper space for mounting an 18-pounder pivot gun. The\r\narrangements for carrying on the service were as follows:—Twenty-four\r\nhours after the arrival of the packet from Liverpool, one of these\r\nvessels left Halifax for Bermuda; at the same time another left\r\nfor St. John’s, while the third conveyed the mails monthly between\r\nBermuda and New York. The payment for these services amounted to\r\n£10,600 per annum, equal to 3s. per mile, while on the main line it\r\nwas 11s. 4d. per mile. The following year the British Government made\r\nanother contract with the Cunard Company for a monthly conveyance\r\neach way of the mails between Bermuda and St. Thomas, upon such days\r\nas might be fixed by the Admiralty, the one vessel engaged in it\r\nbeing in all respects similar to those engaged in the Halifax and\r\nBermuda service. The amount of subsidy was £4,100 per annum, or equal\r\nto 4s. per mile. This service connected the West Indies with the\r\nUnited States and the North American provinces.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of the British Government, the United States\r\nCongress resolved to subsidise a line of American steamships between\r\nNew York and Liverpool. The steamers were to be of the highest\r\nclass, possessing great speed and superior passenger accommodation,\r\nand capable, besides, of being converted at a small expense into\r\nwar steamers. The responsible task of establishing the line was\r\nundertaken by Mr. E. K. Collins, of New York, after whom the line was\r\nnamed. Mr. Collins had had considerable experience as a shipowner,\r\nbeing well-known as the head of the Collins Line of sailing packets\r\nbetween Liverpool and New York. Associated with Mr. Collins in his\r\nlater enterprise were many influential American citizens, and their\r\nproposals were favourably received by the American Government, and\r\nultimately an agreement was entered into, by which Mr. Collins and\r\nhis colleagues undertook to provide five first-class steam vessels\r\nand to maintain a weekly mail service between New York and Liverpool,\r\neach vessel performing twenty voyages annually, for which service\r\nthey were to receive $19,250 per voyage. It is evident that the\r\nUnited States Government were prepared to pay most liberally for the\r\nperformance of the ocean mail service. At par the subsidy represented\r\n£4,010 8s. 4d. per voyage. Assured of this substantial income, Mr.\r\nCollins sought the assistance of the most competent shipbuilders\r\nand engineers of the United States, and on the completion of the\r\ncontract, arrangements were entered into for the construction of four\r\nvessels, to be named the ARCTIC, BALTIC, ATLANTIC and PACIFIC, each\r\nto be about 3,000 tons register and of 800 horse-power. The principal\r\ndimensions of these celebrated steamers were—Length on main deck, 282\r\nfeet; depth from the main deck, 24 feet; depth under the spar deck,\r\n32 feet; breadth of beam, 45 feet. They had rounded sterns, three\r\nmasts with suitable spars; four decks, viz., lower, main, spar, and\r\norlop deck, extending from the engine room forward and aft. They were\r\nbuilt chiefly of live oak, planked with pitchpine, and were equal, if\r\nnot superior, in strength to any wooden steamers afloat. The timbers,\r\nwhich were solid and bolted to each other, were further strengthened\r\nby a lattice work of iron bands. All the four steamers were beautiful\r\nmodels, and the ARCTIC, which was esteemed the finest of the fleet,\r\nwas familiarly known as the “clipper of the seas.” She was built by\r\nMr. W. H. Brown, of New York, under the superintendence of Mr. George\r\nSteers, who modelled the famous yacht America. Her equipment was\r\ncomplete, and of the highest order, while her cabin accommodation\r\nsurpassed in comfort and elegance any merchant steamer Great Britain\r\nthen possessed. The engines of the ARCTIC and her sister ships were\r\nof the “side-lever” type, the cylinder having a diameter of 95\r\ninches, with a 9 feet stroke. The boilers of the ARCTIC and BALTIC\r\nwere peculiar to the Collins Line, and were designed by Messrs.\r\nSewell and Faron, chief engineers of the United States Navy. The\r\nlatter of these two gentlemen acted as chief engineer of the Company.\r\nThe boilers were arranged with double furnaces, and lower water\r\nspaces connected by a row of vertical tubes, around which the heated\r\ngases circulated, with a hanging bridge or plate, which checked their\r\notherwise rapid flow to the funnel, and rendered the combustion more\r\nperfect. The average consumption per 24 hours by the ARCTIC was 83\r\ntons anthracite coal, attaining an average speed of 316·4 knots per\r\nday. Her maximum consumption was 87 tons, with a speed of 320 knots\r\nin 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThese vessels were constructed so utterly regardless of expense that\r\nto complete them it was found the cost would be very greatly in\r\nexcess of the estimates. The Government was therefore appealed to for\r\nassistance. The appeal was generously responded to. The United States\r\nGovernment not only made an advance to the Company while the ships\r\nwere being built, but also released it from its obligation to build\r\na fifth vessel as originally contemplated, and increased the subsidy\r\nfrom $19,250 to $33,000 per voyage. But for these benefits increased\r\nspeed was demanded. “We must have speed,” declared Mr. Bayard, during\r\nthe debate in Congress, “extraordinary speed—a speed with which they\r\n(the Collins steamships) can overtake any vessel which they pursue,\r\nand escape from any vessel they wish to avoid; they must be fit for\r\nthe purpose of a cruiser, with armaments to attack your enemy (if\r\nthat enemy were Great Britain) in her most vital part, her commerce.”\r\nHappily the contest was a commercial and not a national one, and\r\nthe Collins steamers were never required for the purposes of Mr.\r\nBayard’s hypothesis. They did, however, engage (and for a time with\r\napparent success) in a great contest with the Cunard Company for the\r\ncommercial maritime supremacy of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe ATLANTIC, the first of the Collins Line of steamers to cross\r\nthe ocean, arrived at Liverpool on the 10th May, 1850. The breadth\r\nof beam of this vessel and her sister ships was so great that they\r\nwere unable to enter any existing docks at Liverpool, and a dock\r\nat the north end of the port was constructed specially for their\r\naccommodation. The arrival of the ATLANTIC excited very great\r\ninterest, which was increased rather than lessened by the presence\r\nat Liverpool of the ASIA R.M.S., just built for the Cunard Line, and\r\nwhich left for New York on the following Saturday week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASIA. Cunard Steamship Co.]\r\n\r\nThe following description[19] of the interior decorations of the\r\nATLANTIC may be taken as a general description of the whole of the\r\nCollins steamers, and will be read with interest:—\r\n\r\nHer saloon is 67 feet long by 20 feet wide. Her interior fittings\r\nare truly elegant, the woodwork being of white holly, satinwood,\r\nrosewood, &c., so combined and diversified as to present an\r\nexceedingly rich and costly appearance. In the drawing room the\r\nornaments consist of costly mirrors, bronze-work, stained glass,\r\npaintings, &c. Between the panels connecting the staterooms are\r\nthe arms of the different states of the confederacy painted in the\r\nhighest style of art, and framed with bronze-work. The pillars\r\nbetween are inlaid with mirrors, framed with rosewood, and at the\r\ntop and bottom are bronzed sea-shells of costly workmanship. In\r\nthe centre of each are allegorical figures representing the ocean\r\nmythology of the ancients, in bronze and burnished gold. The ceiling\r\nis elaborately wrought, carved and gilded. The cabin windows in the\r\nstern are of painted glass, having representations of New York,\r\nBoston and Philadelphia painted on each. There is in addition\r\nanother apartment equally beautifully arranged and ornamented, for\r\nthe exclusive use of ladies. Both apartments are heated by steam,\r\nan improvement now for the first time introduced in steamships.\r\nThe dining room (60 feet long) is furnished in an equally elegant\r\nstyle with the drawing room. The staterooms, which are light and\r\nairy, are beautifully furnished and ornamented, and combine every\r\nconvenience that practical science and experience could suggest. It\r\nwould occupy more space than can be spared to detail the magnificence\r\nof the furniture of the ATLANTIC; the carpets are of the richest\r\ndescription; the table-slabs are of Brocatelli marble. Each\r\nstateroom has an elegant sofa; the berths are of satinwood, and the\r\ncurtains of rich damask.\r\n\r\nThe ATLANTIC left New York on the 27th April, 1850, with nearly\r\na hundred passengers, and a valuable cargo, under the command of\r\nCaptain West. Shortly after leaving Sandy Hook she got entangled\r\namongst some drift ice, which did considerable damage to her floats.\r\nThis mishap was a serious drawback to her, inasmuch as the engines\r\nhad to be worked at a reduced rate to prevent the floats from being\r\ntorn from the wheels altogether, and the weather was too boisterous\r\nto admit of them being repaired. During the five succeeding days, the\r\nnoble vessel continued to prosecute her voyage to the satisfaction of\r\nher captain and all on board. On the 3rd May, however, an accident\r\nof a more formidable nature occurred, one of her condensers giving\r\nway. After a fruitless attempt to adjust the machinery, the vessel\r\nhaving been hove to forty hours, Captain West decided to pursue his\r\ncourse, the steam being kept at a low point in consequence, which\r\nconsiderably retarded the vessel’s progress during the remainder of\r\nher passage.\r\n\r\nThe American steamers were swifter than their British rivals, and for\r\na few years were the favourites with the travelling public. According\r\nto a return published in the “New York Herald” on the 1st January,\r\n1853, the number of passengers carried during the eleven months\r\nJanuary to November (inclusive), 1852, were:—\r\n\r\n  By Collins Line, New York to Liverpool      2,420\r\n   ” Cunard Line     do.        do.           1,783\r\n   ” Collins Line, Liverpool to New York      1,886\r\n   ” Cunard Line     do.       do.            1,186\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the majority of passengers carried were from\r\nNew York to Liverpool, the explanation of this unusual circumstance\r\nbeing that it was at the time of the great rush to the Australian\r\ngoldfields, when it was no uncommon thing for a Melbourne packet\r\nto sail from the Mersey with from five to six hundred passengers.\r\nNor were the receipts from passage money the only source of revenue\r\navailable for the Collins steamers. They were loyally supported by\r\nAmerican shippers and importers, and the receipts from freight were\r\nlarge, although the rate on fine goods had been lowered from £7 10s.\r\nto £4 per ton.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the large income derived from these sources, the\r\nservice was only maintained for a period of about ten years. The\r\nheavy disbursements and the numerous casualties which befell the\r\nsteamers, especially the loss of the ARCTIC (as narrated in the\r\nfollowing chapter) and of the PACIFIC, with all on board, led to the\r\ncollapse of the company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. “Umbria” in Mid-Atlantic]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] “Illustrated London News,” 18th May, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nThe Loss of the Collins Liner ARCTIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, 27th September, 1854, about noon—Cape Race bearing\r\nS.W. by W., 65 miles distant—the steamship ARCTIC, on her passage\r\nfrom Liverpool to New York, while running through a very thick fog,\r\nwas struck on the starboard bow about 60 feet abaft the cutwater by\r\nan iron steamer. The force of the impact made three large holes in\r\nthe ARCTIC—two below the watermark, one of which was about 5½ feet\r\nin length and about 1½ feet broad. The fog was so dense that neither\r\nvessel saw the other a minute before they collided.\r\n\r\nThe passengers on the ARCTIC were at lunch when their vessel was\r\nstruck, and they immediately rushed on deck. Through the dense fog\r\ncould be seen very indistinctly on the starboard bow a screw steamer,\r\nwhich was afterwards found to be the French merchant steamer VESTA.\r\nNo apprehension of danger was felt by those on board the ARCTIC, and\r\na boat in charge of the chief officer was sent off to the rescue\r\nof the passengers and crew of the other steamer. On board of the\r\nVESTA no hope was entertained of her ultimate safety, the crew and\r\npassengers relying upon being taken off by the crew of the ARCTIC.\r\nWhen the collision occurred there were several men on the bow of\r\nthe VESTA, presumably on the lookout, one of whom was killed and\r\nthe others severely wounded. As it was feared that the steamer was\r\nsinking, a rush was made for the boats, and two were launched. The\r\nfirst boat was swamped, but the second boat floated, and was at\r\nonce boarded by several of the passengers and two of the crew, who,\r\nignoring the captain’s orders to return on board, cut themselves\r\nadrift, and abandoned their shipmates. While these occurrences were\r\ntaking place on the deck of the VESTA the ARCTIC had disappeared\r\nin the fog, those on the VESTA still hoping, however, that she had\r\nnot deserted them. Meantime, the officers on board the ARCTIC had\r\ndiscovered that there was little hope of saving their vessel. Mrs.\r\nCollins, the wife of the managing owner, with their daughter and\r\nson, were passengers, and the captain’s first thought was for their\r\nsafety. They and several ladies were placed in a lifeboat, but while\r\nit was being lowered one of its tackles gave way, and all, with the\r\nexception of one lady who clung to a sailor holding fast to the\r\nboat, were cast into the sea and drowned. A second boat was lowered\r\nsuccessfully, and stored with provisions. It was soon filled with\r\npassengers—ladies and gentlemen—but by a strange oversight on the\r\npart of the officer in charge none of the crew accompanied them.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty and danger of lowering the boats was greatly increased\r\nin consequence of the impossibility of stopping the ship for that\r\npurpose, the pumps having been attached to the main engines in the\r\nattempt to keep the vessel clear of water, which was pouring into\r\nher through the breaches in her side. Cape Race being within about\r\nfour hours steaming distance, she was headed in that direction, but\r\nafter running about fifteen miles the water had risen so high in\r\nthe stoke-hole as to extinguish the fires, and, in consequence, the\r\nengines ceased to work. Almost immediately after the ship stopped,\r\nthe remaining lifeboats left the ship. There was one large boat on\r\ndeck, which was capable of carrying fifty persons, but there were not\r\nsufficient seamen left on board to launch her, and it is supposed\r\nthat she was filled with passengers in the hope that she might float\r\noff when the steamer sank.\r\n\r\nIn the Annual Register for 1854, it is stated that Captain Luce and\r\nmost of his officers exerted themselves with firmness and energy\r\nwhile a hope remained, and the former probably owed his life to his\r\nremaining at his post. When his steamer sank he clung first to some\r\nfloating wood, and afterwards got on a floating paddlebox, on which\r\neleven others had taken refuge, of whom nine were swept away by the\r\nsea, the three survivors being rescued by the CAMBRIA, of Glasgow.\r\nThe captain’s son was killed in his father’s arms by a piece of wreck.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Captain Duchesne, of the VESTA, was most praiseworthy.\r\nFinding that the ARCTIC had disappeared in the fog, and that his\r\nown vessel had not sunk under him, he, with the utmost promptitude,\r\ntook measures for saving his ship and passengers. He noticed that,\r\nalthough the steamer’s bows were completely shattered, the forecastle\r\nbulkhead had not given way, and this afforded some hope of safety. He\r\nat once gave orders to lighten the vessel by the head, by throwing\r\noverboard all the fish, cargo, passengers’ luggage, &c., which was in\r\nthe forepart of the ship, all of which orders were promptly obeyed,\r\nand by means of which the vessel’s bows were raised considerably. Her\r\nhead was raised still more by cutting away the foremast, which had\r\nbeen damaged by the collision. The captain next ordered about 150\r\nmattresses, palliasses and other effects belonging to the crew and\r\npassengers to be placed abaft the forecastle bulkhead, over which\r\nwere thrown sails, backed by boards and planks, the whole being\r\nsecured by cables firmly wrapped round all.\r\n\r\nThese operations occupied two days, after which Captain Duchesne\r\nproceeded under easy steam for the nearest port (St. John’s), which\r\nwas entered on the 30th September. Most providentially, considering\r\nthe disabled condition of the VESTA, she entered the harbour of\r\nSt. John’s before the rising of a severe gale, which sprang up on\r\nthe same day. The energy, unwavering perseverance, and superior\r\nseamanship exhibited by Captain Duchesne in bringing his vessel into\r\nport, elicited the admiration and praise of all who visited the ship.\r\n\r\nThe American Consul at St. John’s made every exertion to procure\r\nvessels to go at once in search of the ARCTIC or her boats. He\r\nsucceeded in obtaining the brigantine ANN ELIZA, whose owners\r\n(Messrs. Warren Bros.) generously gave her without charge. She sailed\r\nfrom St. John’s on the 2nd October, with instructions to cruise in\r\nthe vicinity of the catastrophe for three days.\r\n\r\nThe Right Rev. Dr. Field also promptly placed at the disposal of the\r\nAmerican Consul his yacht, the HAWK, for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe last moments of the ARCTIC are thus graphically described[20] by\r\nMr. Baahlam, the second officer of the steamer:—\r\n\r\n  “In about thirty minutes all the lower fires were out, and, at the\r\n  least, there were six feet of water in the ship fore and aft. By\r\n  this time the confusion amongst the passengers was very great, but\r\n  they used all efforts to assist the crew to keep the pumps going,\r\n  and in lightening the ship forward for the purpose of getting at\r\n  the leak from the inside, which we found to be useless, and numbers\r\n  of them got into the boats, which were still hanging to the davits.\r\n  In forty-five minutes after the collision I came up from the\r\n  forehold, and informed the captain that the water was on a level\r\n  with the lower deck beams, and that it was impossible to get at\r\n  the leak. I then asked him what he thought would be the probable\r\n  fate of the ship, when he stated his belief to me that there was no\r\n  hope of saving her. He then told me to see to my boats. On going\r\n  to those on the port side I found them completely filled with men\r\n  and women, and no possibility of getting near them. I immediately\r\n  went to the starboard side and ordered two of the crew to lower\r\n  the guard boat, and asked the captain what his intentions were,\r\n  who replied that the ship’s fate would be his. I then asked him if\r\n  he would not allow his son to go with me, as I intended to take a\r\n  boat, but he returned me the answer that he should share his fate.\r\n  I then jumped into the boat, and was ordered by the captain to cut\r\n  away the tackle falls, and drop under the stern. I did so; at which\r\n  time about twenty persons, as I suppose, jumped overboard, of whom\r\n  seventeen or eighteen were picked up. I fell in with another boat\r\n  which had been lowered from the other side, and lightened her of\r\n  part of her complement, leaving nineteen in her, and twenty-six\r\n  in my own boat. The last sight we had of the ship her guards were\r\n  level with the water, and the surface of the sea strewed with human\r\n  beings, who had jumped or fallen overboard—to whom, however, it was\r\n  impossible for us to render any assistance; and we soon lost sight\r\n  of all, as the fog continued very dense. I then asked the boat’s\r\n  crew whether they were willing to be governed by me, which was\r\n  unanimously approved, and I was put in complete command of both\r\n  boats.\r\n\r\n  “We were then about sixty miles S.E. of Cape Race. Deeming it my\r\n  duty, for the safety of all, I took the nearest course for the\r\n  land, and, after pulling forty-two hours, with nothing to guide\r\n  us but the run of the sea, which I took to be heaving from the\r\n  southward, and in a thick fog which lasted all the time, we reached\r\n  Broad Cove, some twelve miles North of Cape Race.”\r\n\r\nThe ARCTIC, when she sailed from Liverpool on this ill-fated voyage,\r\nhad 365 souls on board, of whom only 87 were saved. The hull,\r\nmachinery, and equipment of this steamship were insured for £115,000,\r\nas follows:—Underwritten in the United States, £55,000; in London,\r\n£40,000; and in Glasgow, £20,000.\r\n\r\nThe VESTA, which sailed from St. Peter’s the day previous to the\r\ncollision, had 197 persons on board, viz., a crew of 50 men and 147\r\npassengers; of these 13 were reported missing when she arrived at St.\r\nJohn’s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Setting Sun]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] “Illustrated London News,” 21st October, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSteamship Companies of the past.—Inman Line.—National Line.—Guion\r\nLine.—Royal Atlantic Steam Navigation Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early spring of 1850 Messrs. Tod and MacGregor, iron\r\nshipbuilders and engineers, Glasgow, launched the iron screw steamer\r\nCITY OF GLASGOW, a vessel of 1,600 tons and 350 horse-power. During\r\nthe spring and summer of that year she made several voyages between\r\nGlasgow and New York, but in the latter part of the year she was\r\npurchased by the Liverpool, New York and Philadelphia Steamship\r\nCompany, and sailed from Liverpool to Philadelphia on the 17th\r\nDecember, 1850. This vessel was the pioneer of what is better known\r\nas the “Inman” Line. This ill-fated vessel left port on 1st March,\r\n1854, with four hundred and eighty persons on board, and was never\r\nagain heard of. In 1851 the Inman Company purchased the steamship\r\nCITY OF MANCHESTER, built also by Tod & MacGregor. Her registered\r\ntonnage was 2,125 tons; her length 274 feet, and her breadth 38 feet.\r\nShe had a clipper bow and bowsprit, four masts square rigged on the\r\nfore and main masts, with her funnel between the main and mizzen\r\nmasts. Other iron screw steamers, all having the beautiful clipper\r\nbow for which this line was noted, were quickly added to the fleet,\r\ncomprising the KANGAROO, CITY OF BALTIMORE, CITY OF WASHINGTON, CITY\r\nOF BOSTON, CITY OF BRISTOL, CITY OF LIMERICK, CITY OF LINCOLN, CITY\r\nOF LONDON, CITY OF DURHAM, CITY OF NEW YORK, CITY OF PARIS, CITY OF\r\nANTWERP, CITY OF BROOKLYN, CITY OF BRUSSELS, CITY OF MONTREAL, CITY\r\nOF CHESTER, CITY OF CHICAGO, CITY OF RICHMOND and CITY OF BERLIN.\r\n\r\nDuring the first five years of its existence, the Inman Company\r\nmaintained a fortnightly service between Liverpool and Philadelphia,\r\nbut in 1857 it enlarged the area of its operations by making New\r\nYork one of its ports of arrival and by establishing a fortnightly\r\nline thither. On the collapse of the Collins Line, Mr. Inman at once\r\nassumed their dates of sailing, and increased the service to once\r\na week, and was appointed to carry the United States mails between\r\nEngland and America. Nor were the Inman steamers, though screws, less\r\nswift than their predecessors. Their later steamers far surpassed the\r\nswiftest steamers of the Collins Line, and one of these, the CITY OF\r\nPARIS, in 1869 conveyed H.R.H. Prince Arthur to America in six days\r\ntwenty-one hours, the quickest passage (up to that date) ever made to\r\nany port of the New World from Cork.\r\n\r\nMr. Inman specially directed his attention to the conveyance of\r\nemigrant passengers across the Atlantic, and he and Mrs. Inman,\r\ngreatly to their credit, made a voyage in one of their earliest\r\nemigrant steamers, expressly for the purpose of ameliorating the\r\ndiscomforts and evils hitherto but too common in emigrant ships.\r\nThe following table shows how successful he was in catering for the\r\nemigrant passenger trade:—\r\n\r\n  PASSENGERS LANDED AT NEW YORK FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM\r\n  IN 1870:—\r\n\r\n                            Cabin\r\n       Line.

They sailed, but never reached the desired haven, and in\r\ncourse of time were posted “missing.” Two of them, the CITY OF LONDON\r\nand the CITY OF LIMERICK, were sold to Messrs. W. H. Ross & Co., and\r\nsailed for some time between London and New York. The CITY OF ANTWERP\r\nwas purchased by Messrs. William Johnston and Co., who changed\r\nher name to THANEMORE and employed her for several years in their\r\nLiverpool and Baltimore trade. By a strange fatality, each of the\r\nthree steamers last named, sailed from its respective port and was\r\nnever afterwards heard of. The first two disappeared in 1881, and\r\nthe third in 1890. The CITY OF RICHMOND was sold to a firm who were\r\nthe first to employ ocean liners for ocean pleasure cruising, and\r\nfor two or three summers she sailed from Newcastle to the Norwegian\r\nfjords.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Mr. William Inman, which occurred in 1881, the\r\nmanagement of the line was taken over by Messrs. Richardson, Spence &\r\nCo. Since then it has undergone several changes. Its title of Inman\r\nLine was discontinued, and that of “American” Line adopted, and its\r\nBritish headquarters transferred from Liverpool to Southampton. It is\r\nnow (1903) one of the group of Atlantic steamship companies included\r\nin the “Morgan” combine.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, a number of Liverpool merchants and shipowners, anticipating\r\na large trade would arise between this country and the Confederate\r\nStates of North America on the termination of the civil war then\r\nraging, formed themselves into a company under the title of the\r\nNational Steam Navigation Co., with a capital of £700,000. It was\r\nthe intention of the promoters of the company to establish a regular\r\nservice of first-class steamships between Liverpool and the Southern\r\nStates. The requisite capital was quickly subscribed, and three\r\nsteamships were promptly acquired; but, alas! the hoped-for peace\r\ndid not arrive as soon as the promoters anticipated. Under these\r\ncircumstances the Directors decided to enter into competition with\r\nthe Cunard and Inman Companies for a share of the passenger and\r\ngoods trade to and from the Northern States. The pioneer vessel of\r\nthe new company was the LOUISIANA, which vessel sailed on her maiden\r\nvoyage from Liverpool to New York in the year 1863. She was followed\r\nby the VIRGINIA and the PENNSYLVANIA, each of these vessels being\r\nbetween 3,000 and 3,500 gross tonnage, and consequently they were the\r\nlargest cargo carriers afloat at that time. During the following year\r\n(1864) three new steamers of still larger tonnage were added to the\r\nfleet. These were named respectively THE QUEEN, ERIN and HELVETIA.\r\nSo successful were these vessels that twelve months later (1865) two\r\nmore steamers were built for the Company, viz., the ENGLAND and\r\nDENMARK, both of 3,723 tons gross, and these were followed in 1866 by\r\nthe FRANCE, a vessel of about the same tonnage.\r\n\r\nA great advance in the size of the Company’s steamers was made in\r\n1868, when the ITALY, a steamer of 4,300 tons, was placed on the\r\nline. Not only was the ITALY the largest transatlantic liner at that\r\ndate, but she was also the first in which compound engines were\r\nfitted. A somewhat smaller steamship, the HOLLAND, of 3,847 tons\r\ngross, was built in 1869. The following year two very large and\r\npowerful vessels were added to the fleet. These were the EGYPT, of\r\n4,669 tons gross, and the SPAIN, of 4,512 tons; both steamers were\r\nbuilt on the Mersey, the former by the Liverpool Shipbuilding Co.,\r\nand the latter by Messrs. Laird, of Birkenhead.\r\n\r\nThe Company now possessed a sufficiently large fleet to maintain a\r\nregular weekly service between Liverpool and New York, sailing from\r\nLiverpool every Wednesday, and from New York every Saturday; and a\r\nfortnightly service from London to New York, via Havre.\r\n\r\nThe steamships of this line were good, roomy, comfortable boats,\r\nwith lofty ’tween decks. They carried immense cargoes of cotton,\r\ngrain, provisions, and other American produce from the United States\r\nto Great Britain, and though they could not compare with the Cunard\r\nor Inman liners in the elegance of the accommodation provided for\r\nsaloon passengers, yet they were well adapted for the conveyance\r\nof emigrants, of whom they carried large numbers. As they did not\r\nspecially cater for saloon passengers, and carried no mails, they\r\nwere not driven at the high rate of speed maintained by the premier\r\ntransatlantic steamship companies. It is true that for a time the\r\nNational Line held the “Blue Ribbon” of the Atlantic, but this\r\nhonourable position was held for a very short time only, and the\r\nvessel by which it was gained was sold to the Italian Government. The\r\nsteamer referred to was the AMERICA, built and engined by Messrs. J.\r\n& G. Thomson, Glasgow, in 1883. Her gross tonnage was 5,528 tons,\r\nwith compound engines of 1,064 horse-power nominal. Her length was\r\n441 feet 8 inches; breadth, 51 feet 2 inches; and her depth 36 feet.\r\n\r\nIn less than twelve months from the date of her launch, she was\r\npurchased by the Italian Government, by whom she was equipped as an\r\narmed cruiser, and renamed ITALIA. Prior to the construction of the\r\nAMERICA, the Company had increased its fleet by the addition of the\r\nsteamers GREECE and CANADA. On the 31st December, 1889, the ERIN\r\nsailed with seventy-two persons on board, and disappeared without\r\nleaving a trace.\r\n\r\nAfter trading successfully for a number of years, the National\r\nSteamship Company got into financial difficulties. Its vessels were\r\ndispersed; the Liverpool service to New York was abandoned, and\r\nonly that from London retained. When the nineteenth century closed\r\nthe only steamers sailing under its flag were the AMERICA, EUROPE\r\nand MANHATTAN. These three steamers are built of steel, and each\r\ncarries four masts. They are all driven by triple-expansion engines,\r\nand the last-named vessel is a twin-screw steamer. The respective\r\nmeasurements are as follows:—\r\n\r\nAMERICA, 5,158 tons gross, built and engined by Gourlay Brothers &\r\nCo., Dundee, in 1891, is 435 feet long, 46 feet 3 inches broad, and\r\n25 feet 2 inches deep, with engines of 516 nominal horse-power.\r\n\r\nEUROPE, 5,302 tons gross, built and engined by Palmers, Limited,\r\nNewcastle, in 1891, is 435 feet long, 46 feet 4 inches broad, and 25\r\nfeet 2 inches deep, with engines of 545 nominal horse-power.\r\n\r\nMANHATTAN, 8,004 tons gross, built and engined by Harland and Wolff,\r\nBelfast, in 1898, is 490 feet 5 inches long, 56 feet 3 inches broad,\r\nand 25 feet deep, with engines of 478 nominal horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe National Line, like the Inman Line, has now been absorbed by the\r\nAmerican combine.\r\n\r\nFor several years prior to 1863, Mr. Stephen B. Guion, of New York,\r\nhad established a line of clipper ships between that port and\r\nLiverpool. Finding it impossible to contend against screw steamers in\r\nthe ocean trade, he entered (in the year named) into an arrangement\r\nto supply, through his old connections and agents in America, the\r\nCunard and National Companies with steerage passengers and cargo for\r\ntheir steamers. This arrangement held good until 1866, when Mr.\r\nGuion, in co-partnery with others, formed a steamship company whose\r\nofficial title was “The Liverpool and Great Western Steamship Co.,”\r\nbut which was popularly known as the Guion Line. The first steamer of\r\nthe new line was the iron screw steamer MANHATTAN, which sailed from\r\nLiverpool to New York in August, 1866. This steamer was still afloat\r\nin 1903, being then the property of Messrs. W. H. Ross & Co., by whom\r\nshe was renamed the CITY OF LINCOLN. The fleet of the Guion Line was\r\nspeedily sufficiently numerous to maintain a regular weekly service\r\nfrom Liverpool to New York, and within six years of the formation of\r\nthe Company it possessed eight first-class iron screw steamships,\r\neach of about 3,000 tons burthen. They were named after the Western\r\nStates of America, viz., MANHATTAN, NEBRASKA, MINNESOTA, COLORADO,\r\nIDAHO, NEVADA, WISCONSIN, and WYOMING. In 1874 the MONTANA, of 3,500\r\ntons, was added to the fleet, which was further increased in 1875 by\r\nthe addition of the DAKOTA.\r\n\r\nNone of the vessels named had distinguished themselves by their\r\nextraordinary speed; but in 1879 there was built for the Guion Line,\r\nby the Fairfield Shipbuilding Company, the steamer ARIZONA. She was\r\nan entirely new type of vessel. The older ships, though differing\r\nin their models, might be described generally as brig rigged screw\r\nsteamers carrying a single funnel amidships, and having their saloons\r\naft. The ARIZONA carried four masts, of which the fore and main were\r\nsquare rigged, and two funnels between the main and mizzen masts. The\r\nsaloon was situated amidships, and was superbly furnished. The length\r\nof the ARIZONA was 450 feet, her breadth 45 feet, and her depth 35\r\nfeet. She sailed on her first voyage from Liverpool to New York on\r\nthe 31st May, 1879, and is at the present date (1903) employed as a\r\ntroopship by the U.S. Government, her name having been changed to the\r\nHANCOCK.\r\n\r\nA sister vessel to the ARIZONA was built by the same builders\r\nin 1881. She was larger and more powerful than the ARIZONA, and\r\nincreased the reputation for speed which that steamer had created.\r\nThe ALASKA left Liverpool on her maiden voyage on the 29th October,\r\n1881. On the 12th September, 1882, she sailed from New York, and\r\ncompleted her voyage to Queenstown in 6 days 18 hours and 38 minutes.\r\nThis rapid passage was, however, excelled by the same Company’s\r\nsteamer OREGON, which sailed from Liverpool to New York on the 6th\r\nOctober, 1883, and made the passage from Queenstown to Sandy Hook in\r\n6 days 10 hours and 9 minutes. The OREGON was also built and engined\r\nby the Fairfield Shipbuilding Co. She was 501 feet long, 54 feet 2\r\ninches broad, and 38 feet deep. Her gross tonnage was 7,375 tons; and\r\nher engines developed 13,500 horse-power, giving a speed of 18 knots\r\nper hour. Her career was a brief but brilliant one. Built in 1883,\r\nshe sank after a collision with an American schooner on the 11th\r\nMarch, in 1886.\r\n\r\nThese three celebrated steamers, the ALASKA, ARIZONA and OREGON were\r\npopularly known as the “Greyhounds of the Atlantic.” As has been\r\nstated, the OREGON was lost after collision, the ARIZONA is still\r\nafloat, and the ALASKA was sold in 1902 for the purpose of breaking\r\nup. After the decease of Mr. S. B. Guion, which occurred on the 19th\r\nDecember, 1885, the steamers of the fleet were gradually disposed of\r\nto various purchasers. The firm, however, of Guion & Co. is still in\r\nexistence, as passenger agents, the business being carried on by Mr.\r\nFrank Ramsden and Mr. I. O. Roberts.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Atlantic Steam Navigation Company, better known as the\r\n“Galway Line,” was established by a number of English and Irish\r\ngentlemen, who in January, 1859, proposed to the British Government\r\nto carry H.M. mails from Galway to Portland, Boston, or New York, via\r\nSt. John’s, Newfoundland, or otherwise, for the sum of £3,000 on the\r\nround voyage. They further offered “to convey telegraphic messages\r\nfrom the United Kingdom to British North America and the United\r\nStates in six days, casualties excepted.” As the Atlantic cable was\r\nnot then in existence, the Government was favourably disposed to the\r\nscheme, and on the 21st April, 1859, a contract was entered into with\r\nthe said company, based on the terms of the proposals made to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th June following, the Royal Atlantic Steam Navigation\r\nCompany contracted with Messrs. Palmer, of Newcastle, for the\r\nconstruction of two steamships, the cost of each to be £95,000; and\r\nfive days later (15th June) they concluded a similar contract with\r\nMessrs. Samuelson, of Hull, for two steamships, to cost £97,000 each.\r\nAs the date of the commencement of the postal service, according to\r\nthe Government contract, was fixed for June, 1860, the contract with\r\nthe builders stipulated for delivery of the vessels within eleven\r\nmonths from the date of the agreement. It was also a condition of the\r\ncontracts, that the ships were to be built according to lines, plans,\r\nand specifications approved by the Admiralty. The four steamships\r\nreferred to were almost uniform in model, measurement and equipment.\r\nEach measured about 2,800 tons, with engines of about 850 nominal\r\nhorse-power. Their principal dimensions were—Length 360 feet, beam\r\n40 feet, and depth of hold 32 feet. Those built by Messrs. Palmer\r\nwere named CONNAUGHT and HIBERNIA, and those by Messrs. Samuelson,\r\nCOLUMBIA and ANGLIA. A clause in the Company’s contract with the\r\nbuilders specified “that each of the said vessels when completed was,\r\non a fair and proper trial thereof, to accomplish a speed at the\r\nrate of 20 statute miles per hour in smooth water, and to consume\r\nnot more than 8,800 pounds of fuel per hour.” In the case of the\r\nCONNAUGHT this condition was not complied with, for on her trial trip\r\nthe Government Inspector reported that the speed of this “vessel was\r\nabout thirteen knots.”\r\n\r\nFrom its commencement the Company was in difficulties. The second\r\nsteamer, the HIBERNIA, on being surveyed by the Government\r\nInspectors, was found to be leaky. None of the vessels were\r\ndelivered within the time agreed upon, and in order to keep faith\r\nwith the Government the Company was compelled to charter a steamer\r\nto inaugurate the service. They accordingly hired from the Messrs.\r\nMalcomsons, of Waterford, one of their Liverpool and River Plate\r\nsteamers, the PARANA, which sailed from Galway on the 27th June,\r\n1860, and arrived at St. John’s in seven days thirteen and a half\r\nhours, or one day thirteen and a half hours beyond the stipulated\r\ntime for delivering the telegraph messages at St. John’s.\r\n\r\nThe second steamer to sail from Galway was the CONNAUGHT, which\r\nsailed for Boston direct on the 11th July, and was twenty-two and a\r\nhalf hours over contract time in arriving at that port. This steamer\r\nwas totally lost on her second voyage in October of the same year.\r\n\r\nThe third steamer of the Company sailed from Galway on the 9th April,\r\n1861, and returned in May following in a disabled condition, having\r\nmet with ice on the passage. She made the slowest passage outwards\r\nof any of the fleet, having taken ten days seven and a half hours to\r\nreach St. John’s, and seventeen days twenty and three quarter hours\r\nto reach Boston.\r\n\r\nAs two of their own steamers were unavailable, the one being lost\r\nand the other disabled, the Directors found it necessary to take up\r\noutside steamers. They therefore chartered the PRINCE ALBERT, and\r\npurchased the ADRIATIC, one of the latest and most famous of the\r\nCollins Line. She appears to have been the only vessel belonging\r\nto the Company capable of carrying out the terms of the Government\r\nContract. She completed the run from Galway to St. John’s in the\r\nspecified time, six days, and to New York in one day fifteen hours\r\nand fifteen minutes less than contract time. On her return she made\r\nthe passage from St. John’s to Galway in five days nineteen hours\r\nand three quarters, the shortest passage on record from port to port\r\nacross the Atlantic. It is impossible to state what would have been\r\nthe result had the steamers built for the Company been equal to the\r\nADRIATIC, but she was secured too late to retrieve the fortunes of\r\nthe Company. Unable under such adverse circumstances to raise fresh\r\ncapital, the managers of the Company had no course left but to\r\nabandon their undertaking, and they terminated their contract in May,\r\n1861. This unfortunate enterprise entailed a loss to the Government\r\nof about £15,000, while it is probable that the loss incurred by the\r\nshareholders of the Company was not less than £150,000 during the\r\nshort period of its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe ORION wrecked off Portpatrick, 1850.—The steamer NEPTUNE.—A\r\nsecond “Grace Darling,” 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most convincing proofs of the splendid management of\r\nthe several steamship companies which trade between Liverpool and\r\nGlasgow, of the skill and honest workmanship put into the vessels,\r\nand of the great care exercised by the officers who navigate these\r\nships, is the fact that for upwards of eighty years there has been\r\nbut one disaster accompanied by loss of life on this station.\r\n\r\nThe disaster referred to was described at the time as “a disaster\r\noccasioned by the most culpable carelessness.” It was, unfortunately,\r\nattended with frightful loss of life. The ORION, a splendidly fitted\r\nand powerful steamer, sailed from Liverpool for Glasgow, on Monday\r\nafternoon, 18th June, 1850, with about 170 passengers in addition to\r\na crew of 40 all told. It was an ideal summer trip; the night was\r\nfine and clear, and the sea perfectly smooth. All went well with the\r\nsteamer and those on board until, about a quarter past one on the\r\nTuesday morning, the sleeping passengers were rudely awakened by the\r\nconcussion, as the ship struck violently on the rocks, close to the\r\nLighthouse at the entrance to Portpatrick Harbour. The vessel, which\r\nwas steaming at full speed at the time, filled instantly, and sank in\r\na few minutes. The night was so tranquil that many of the passengers\r\nhad slept on deck, but the majority were asleep in the cabins below\r\nwhen the catastrophe occurred. The scene of horror and dismay which\r\nfollowed can be but faintly conceived. A wild rush of crew and\r\npassengers was made to the boats. The first boat lowered to the water\r\nwas so crowded instantly with panic-stricken passengers, that she\r\ncapsized, and all who were in her were drowned. A second boat was\r\nlaunched, in which some ladies were placed, and these reached the\r\nharbour safely. One redeeming feature in this tragic narrative is the\r\nsplendid heroism displayed by many of the gentlemen passengers. The\r\nsecond boat when launched was in the first instance filled by men,\r\nbut when the officers of the ship suggested to them that their first\r\nduty was to save the women and children, most of the men instantly\r\nleft the boat, and assisted females to occupy the places they had\r\nsurrendered, who were thus happily preserved.\r\n\r\nShortly after this boat got away the ill-fated ORION sank, and all on\r\nboard either went down with her, or were left floating on the surface\r\nof the water, or clinging to floating portions of the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe Ardrossan and Fleetwood steamship FENELLA passed the scene\r\nimmediately after the disaster occurred, and the Captain at once\r\nstopped his ship, lowered his boats, and rendered valuable assistance\r\nin saving lives. The Lighthouse keepers and Coastguards had also\r\nobserved the vessel coming too close in shore, and, anticipating\r\na catastrophe, had awakened the local boatmen. Owing to this,\r\nnumerous boats had instantly put off, and these picked up a large\r\nnumber of those floating. By the continued efforts of the FENELLA’s\r\ncrew, and the Portpatrick boatmen, about 150 persons were rescued.\r\nThis dreadful catastrophe carried mourning into many of the most\r\nrespectable families in Liverpool and Glasgow. Amongst those who\r\nperished were Captain McNeil (brother of the Lord Advocate), his wife\r\nand two daughters; Dr. Burns, one of the most popular men in Glasgow,\r\nprofessor of Surgery at the University, and brother to the Managing\r\nowners in Glasgow; Miss Morris, his niece; and Master Martin, a\r\nson of one of the Liverpool owners. The trial of the Captain, and\r\nfirst and second mates of the ORION, for the “culpable bereavement\r\nof the lives of the passengers” who were lost by the wreck of that\r\nsteamer, as before narrated, took place at Edinburgh, before the\r\nHigh Court of Justice, on the 29th August, 1850. It was proved that\r\nduring the second mate’s watch, the vessel approached closer to\r\nthe shore more than was usual by upwards of a mile, and that this\r\ncourse was maintained notwithstanding the warning exclamations of the\r\nexperienced seamen who were on the look out.\r\n\r\nIt was further proved that the Captain had come on deck several\r\ntimes during the second mate’s watch, and each time had observed\r\nboth the compass, and the ship’s proximity to the shore, which could\r\nbe clearly seen, and yet did not countermand the second mate’s\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nThe charge against the first mate was withdrawn, but at the end of\r\nthe trial, which lasted two days, the Court sentenced the Captain\r\nto be imprisoned for eighteen months, and the second mate to be\r\ntransported for seven years.\r\n\r\nIt is a relief to turn from this sad story to an incident connected\r\nwith the steamer NEPTUNE,[21] of which the heroine was a young\r\nNorwegian girl, who has been appropriately termed “A second Grace\r\nDarling.” During the 25th, 26th and 27th November, 1852, a strong\r\ngale prevailed in the North Sea. About midnight on the last date\r\nthe NEPTUNE arrived off the Lighthouse at the entrance to Flekke\r\nFjord, Norway. She was bound from London to St. Petersburg, and had\r\nthe pilot flag flying at her masthead. Just at daybreak the steamer\r\nwas observed by a young girl, who immediately called up two of the\r\nboatmen, who, however, were not apparently inclined to respond to the\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nThe girl, however, realizing the urgency of the appeal for a pilot,\r\nreproached the men with being afraid of the weather, and under\r\nthe pressure of her taunts they got their boat out to go to the\r\nassistance of the NEPTUNE, the girl accompanying them. When they\r\ngot near the ship they found that, owing to the heavy surge, it was\r\nimpossible to get close to the ship’s side. A rope was thrown to\r\nthem, and caught by the girl, who twisted it round her waist and arm,\r\nthen jumped into the sea and was hauled on board the steamer; the two\r\nmen thereupon followed her example. This help was most welcome, and\r\nthe Captain was the more pleased to receive it owing to his cargo\r\nhaving shifted. With the assistance of the Norwegians the rest of\r\nthe voyage was safely accomplished. There were eight lady passengers\r\non board the NEPTUNE, who made much of the Norse “Grace Darling,”\r\nprovided her with dry clothing, and gave her a handsome donation in\r\ncash. The seamen and firemen also contributed three pounds (£3) for\r\nthe same purpose, and on the return voyage she was put ashore at the\r\nplace where she embarked, most fortunately with a considerable amount\r\nof cash in her possession, as her master refused to permit her to\r\nreturn to his service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steamship]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] For further particulars respecting this steamer, see the History\r\nof the Waterford Steamship Co. in Part II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Steam Navigation Co., Ltd., and the GREAT EASTERN,\r\nsteamship.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1851 a steamship company was promoted in London, under\r\nthe title of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, Limited, for the\r\npurpose of establishing a direct line of leviathan steamers between\r\nEngland and India, _via_ the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nThe services of the most distinguished engineers of the period were\r\nsecured, Mr. I. K. Brunel being appointed the consulting engineer\r\nof the company. An order was placed with Messrs. Scott Russell &\r\nCo. for the pioneer steamer, which it was at first the intention of\r\nthe company to call the LEVIATHAN, but that name was subsequently\r\nabandoned in favour of GREAT EASTERN. She was to be propelled by\r\npaddle wheels and a propeller. Mr. Scott Russell designed the lines,\r\nand constructed the hull of the vessel, as well as the engines of\r\n1,000 h. p. nom. to drive the paddle wheels. Messrs. James Watt &\r\nCo., of Soho, designed and constructed the engines, of 1,500 h. p.\r\nnom., to drive the screw propeller. As a matter of course, some\r\nconsiderable time was occupied in preparing the plans for so gigantic\r\na ship—one which was not only the largest ever built up to that date,\r\nbut which remained the largest steamer built to the end of the 19th\r\ncentury. The necessary plans, specifications and yard preparations\r\nwere completed during the spring of 1854, and on the 1st of May\r\nof that year, the construction of the GREAT EASTERN was commenced\r\nby Mr. Scott Russell in his shipbuilding yard at Millwall, on the\r\nnorth side of the Thames. She was built with a double hull from the\r\nkeel to the water line, the inner and the outer skin being of equal\r\nthickness of iron, with a space between of 34 inches. If required\r\nfor ballasting purposes, this space could be filled with 2,500 tons\r\nof water. The length of the GREAT EASTERN was 675 feet, her breadth\r\n83 feet, and her depth 60 feet. She was divided into 60 watertight\r\ncompartments, each 60 feet long. She carried six masts—the mizzen\r\nmast of wood, and the remaining five of hollow wrought iron. Three\r\nof these masts carried square sails, the other three were fore and\r\naft rigged. She had five funnels, two of which were placed forward\r\nof the paddle boxes and three aft. Her hull was constructed of\r\n30,000 plates of iron, weighing 10,000 tons, and joined together by\r\n3,000,000 rivets. “Her cylinders, the four largest in the world ...\r\n(each) 18 feet long, 6 feet in diameter, and 28 tons weight, were\r\nsuccessfully cast at the Engineering Works of Messrs. Scott Russell &\r\nCo., Millwall.”[22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT EASTERN S.S.\r\n\r\n  _Copied by permission of Messrs C. W. Kellock & Co._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn her equipment were included twenty large lifeboats, and it was\r\nintended that she should carry in addition two small steamers, each\r\n100 feet long, to be used for landing and embarking passengers or\r\nluggage.\r\n\r\nShe was designed to carry 10,000 troops or 4,000 passengers, viz.,\r\n800 first-class, 2,000 second-class, and 800 third-class, in addition\r\nto a crew of about 400, and she was capable of stowing 12,000 tons of\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nAlthough, nominally, the engines which drove the paddle wheels were\r\nof 1,000 h. p., they were capable of working up to 5,000 h. p.,\r\nwhile the screw engines worked up to 6,000 h. p., or with combined\r\npaddle and screw her engines could develop 11,000 h. p., which it was\r\nestimated would enable her to maintain at sea a speed of 20 knots per\r\nhour, and to accomplish the voyage between England and Australia in\r\n30 days.\r\n\r\n  “It is a question of much interest to determine what amount of\r\n  speed this power will impart to the vessel. Messrs. James Watt &\r\n  Co.’s anticipation is that the speed of the vessel will be about\r\n  seventeen miles per hour, and from that to eighteen miles seems\r\n  to be about the limit engineers have hitherto predicted. But we\r\n  believe that these anticipations fall very short of what the real\r\n  speed will be, and which we do not hesitate to predict, will turn\r\n  out to be between twenty-four and twenty-five miles per hour.”\r\n  (“Illustrated London News,” 23rd May, 1857).\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, 3rd November, 1857, the first attempt was made to launch\r\nthe GREAT EASTERN. The hour named for commencing the launching\r\noperations was 11 o’clock, and was kept fairly punctually. The chief\r\nmachinery for moving the hull was boxed off, and nearly altogether\r\nout of sight. The vessel’s name, LEVIATHAN, was given by Miss Hope\r\n(who afterwards became the Duchess of Newcastle), the daughter of\r\nthe Chairman of the Great Eastern Steam Navigation Company, and the\r\nname displayed upon a board; the change of name from GREAT EASTERN to\r\nLEVIATHAN occasioning a good deal of surprise. After the customary\r\nbottle of wine was smashed against the vessel’s bow, a “fortissimo\r\nobligate” of sledge hammers resounded above and around—then ceased.\r\nThe great ship moved for a few feet, then stopped. The congregated\r\nthousands waited in suspense, when suddenly a terrific report was\r\nheard. One of the powerful drums used in the launch had cracked. An\r\norder had been misunderstood; the after-winch handles were turned the\r\nwrong way; the heavy iron handles revolved wildly, striking down the\r\nmen, fracturing their arms and legs, and with a fatal result in one\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nA second attempt was made to launch the LEVIATHAN on Thursday, 19th\r\nNovember, 1857, but the efforts were even less successful than on the\r\nfirst occasion, for despite all the mechanical power brought to bear\r\non her she would not move an inch.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, 11th January, 1858, launching operations were resumed at\r\nMillwall, and the monster ship was moved riverwards to the extent of\r\n20 feet. On Tuesday a further advance was made until a little after\r\n3 o’clock in the afternoon, when, having moved 16 feet 10 inches\r\naft, and 15 feet 1 inch forward, it was thought desirable to suspend\r\noperations. At high water on the latter day the ship was water borne\r\nto the height of 7½ feet, which had the effect of diminishing the\r\nresistance to the extent of 4,000 tons. The yard and river banks were\r\ncrowded with spectators on the following day (Wednesday), in the\r\nexpectation that the ship would float, but she was only moved another\r\n2½ inches. On Thursday the LEVIATHAN was pushed down the full extent\r\nof the ways, and there left for the next spring tides.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the launch of this stupendous and beautiful vessel\r\ntook place on Sunday, 31st January, 1858, under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, and unattended with a single accident, the high tide\r\nlifting the vessel clear off the ways.\r\n\r\nIt is incomprehensible how so eminent an engineer as Brunel should\r\nhave made such a mistake as to attempt to force so huge a fabric\r\nbroadside on into the river. The costly experiment added £120,000 to\r\nthe cost of the ship, and practically ruined the company.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the company’s operations, the directors\r\nwere hampered by the failure of many of the shareholders to meet\r\nthe calls upon their shares when due. To add to these difficulties,\r\nMessrs. Scott Russell & Co. (the builders of the ship), in 1855,\r\nfound themselves unable to meet their obligations, and to complete\r\nthe construction of the GREAT EASTERN.\r\n\r\nAt the half-yearly meeting of the company, held on the 15th February,\r\n1856, the chairman reported that the failure of Mr. Scott Russell\r\nwould be a cause of some delay, and of some increased cost in\r\nthe completion of their vessel, which would be undertaken by the\r\ncompany’s engineer, Mr. I. K. Brunel. Twelve months later it was\r\nannounced that calls to date amounted to £606,000, of which nearly\r\n£200,000 remained unpaid, owing to a number of other shareholders, in\r\naddition to Mr. Scott Russell, having become insolvent.\r\n\r\nThe opening months of 1858 saw the GREAT EASTERN successfully\r\nlaunched, but the Great Eastern Steam Navigation Company had not the\r\nfunds necessary for her equipment. During the year the company was\r\nwound up by the sale and transfer of the ship to a new company for\r\nthe sum of £160,000—\r\n\r\n  “All the capital had been expended, the public refused to advance\r\n  any more money, and if the directors wished their ship to be\r\n  anything but a helpless, unfinished carcase on the waters £300,000\r\n  more must be found to make her ready for sea. To the exertions\r\n  of Mr. Campbell (the present chairman of the Board), and to\r\n  Mr. William Jackson (the eminent and well-known contractor of\r\n  Birkenhead), we believe is greatly owing the pleasant result of\r\n  our being at length able to announce that the GREAT EASTERN is\r\n  ready for sea. But one still more remarkable aid was forthcoming,\r\n  and which we could hardly believe, only that we have it on the\r\n  best authority—it was a subscription of no less than £50,000 of\r\n  the supplementary capital, in sums of £1 to £5, by persons in\r\n  the humblest ranks of life (domestic servants, costermongers,\r\n  greengrocers and labourers)—who tendered their money avowedly\r\n  without any expectation of profit, but solely that they might hear\r\n  of the great ship, which they looked upon as the pride of England,\r\n  being fairly afloat on the deep waters. Such a fact at once took\r\n  the vessel out of the category of mere commercial undertakings,\r\n  and more than anything else stimulated the brave men who were her\r\n  projectors to renewed exertions for her ultimate completion.”\r\n  (“Illustrated London News,” 13th August, 1859).\r\n\r\nThe sum of £300,000 having been subscribed for the new undertaking,\r\nthe directors had, after paying for the vessel, a surplus of £140,000\r\nto complete her equipment and make her ready for sea. Her new owners\r\ntook possession of her early in 1859, but it was not until September\r\nof that year that she was sufficiently complete to make her first\r\ntrial trip. While on this trip, and when off Hastings, a shocking\r\naccident occurred, through the explosion of one of the funnel\r\ncasings, causing the death of six men, injuring several others, and\r\nvirtually wrecking the grand saloon. As no further damage was done to\r\nthe hull or machinery, she proceeded to Portland, and the necessary\r\nrepairs having been completed at an outlay of £5,000, she resumed her\r\nvoyage to Holyhead on the 8th October. She started on her return\r\ntrial trip from Holyhead to Southampton on the 2nd November, 1859,\r\nwhere she remained until the 17th June, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe GREAT EASTERN was advertised to leave Southampton on her first\r\nvoyage to New York on Saturday, 16th June, 1860, but, in consequence\r\nof bad weather on that date, the sailing was postponed until the\r\nfollowing morning. She carried only 36 passengers, including several\r\nladies, on this trip. The voyage across the Atlantic occupied eleven\r\ndays. The greatest speed attained was 14½ knots per hour, and the\r\ngreatest distance run by her in any one day was 333 miles. Immense\r\ncrowds assembled to witness her arrival in New York Harbour, and she\r\nwas welcomed with great enthusiasm. She passed the battery at 4-30\r\np.m. on the 28th June, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe promoters of the Great Eastern Steam Navigation Company were very\r\nsanguine that the Government would frequently employ their vessel for\r\nthe conveyance of troops, of which they estimated she could carry ten\r\nthousand. The Government very wisely never risked so great a body of\r\nmen in one vessel.\r\n\r\nThe only occasion on which the GREAT EASTERN was made use of as a\r\ntroopship was during the threatened rupture between England and the\r\nFederal Government of America, in connection with the “Trent Affair.”\r\nShe made her first entry into the port of Liverpool on the 4th June,\r\nhaving made the passage from New York in 9 days 11 hours. She had on\r\nboard 212 passengers and a large cargo. On Thursday, 27th June, 1861,\r\nshe sailed out of the Mersey on a voyage to Quebec, with troops to\r\nreinforce the Canadian garrisons. The day was cloudless, there was\r\nbrilliant sunshine, and the piers and dock walls for five miles, as\r\nwell as the landing-stages, were lined with spectators, who, as the\r\ngreat ship passed them, responded most heartily to the cheers raised\r\nby the soldiers who thronged the upper deck and the lower portions of\r\nthe rigging.\r\n\r\nAs she passed the landing-stages she fired salutes, and also on\r\npassing the Rock Battery. There were on board the GREAT EASTERN, not\r\n10,000 troops as her promoters anticipated, but 2,125 men of all\r\nranks, accompanied by 159 wives and 244 children of the soldiers.\r\nThere were also about 40 civilian passengers in the saloon.\r\n\r\nShe left Quebec on her return voyage on the 6th August, arriving in\r\nLiverpool on the 15th idem, and resumed her sailings to New York.\r\n\r\nShe sailed from Liverpool for New York on the 10th September, under\r\nthe command of Captain Walker, having on board 175 cabin and 193\r\nsteerage passengers. On the following Thursday she encountered a\r\nheavy gale, during which, when about 280 miles westward of Cape\r\nClear, her steering apparatus became deranged and broken, and five\r\nof her lifeboats were carried away. For two days and nights she lay\r\nhelpless, exposed to a terrific sea. Her internal fittings were in\r\nconsequence seriously damaged, and her passengers greatly alarmed for\r\ntheir safety. The Captain decided to abandon the voyage and put back\r\nto Queenstown, arriving in the harbour on the Tuesday following. The\r\npassengers, when once more on _terra firma_, relieved their feelings\r\nby publishing some very angry letters in the Press, in which they\r\nreflected very severely on the managers of the company, but gave\r\nunqualified praise to Captain Walker for the manner in which he had\r\nhandled the great ship in her disabled state.\r\n\r\nThe laying of submarine cables, commenced in 1865, offered employment\r\nfor which the GREAT EASTERN was specially suitable, and in which she\r\nwas constantly engaged for a period of ten years.\r\n\r\nShortly after noon on the 30th June, 1866, the GREAT EASTERN left\r\nthe Medway, having on board the second Atlantic cable. She was\r\nconvoyed by H.M.S. ADDER as far as the Nore. As she steamed past\r\nGarrison Point she was loudly cheered by a vast concourse of people\r\nwho had gathered there. She proceeded direct to Berehaven, in the\r\nextreme South-West of Ireland, which was to be her starting point\r\nfor laying the submarine cable. Four weeks later, or to be exact,\r\nabout 5 o’clock (English time) on the 27th July, this great task was\r\nsuccessfully accomplished. One of the earliest messages transmitted\r\nby the cable was the following from H.M. Queen Victoria to the\r\nPresident of the United States of America:—\r\n\r\n  “The Queen congratulates the President on the successful completion\r\n  of an undertaking which she hopes may serve as an additional bond\r\n  of union between the United States and England.”\r\n\r\nPresident Johnson suitably acknowledged the Royal despatch, and\r\nreciprocated the good wishes contained in it. [A most interesting\r\ndiary of the Atlantic Telegraph Expedition is published in the Annual\r\nRegister for 1866.]\r\n\r\nIn 1867 her cable-laying services were interrupted by a charter to a\r\nFrench company, who employed her between Brest and New York, carrying\r\npassengers to and from the great French Exhibition. For this service\r\nshe was fitted with new boilers for the screw engines, and her\r\nsaloons were altered and redecorated.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of her charter with the French company, she was\r\ntaken up by the Telegraphic Construction and Maintenance Company,\r\nin whose service she remained for seven years. During this period\r\nshe succeeded in laying the cable between Brest and Duckburgh, near\r\nBoston, Mass., in 1868; between Aden and Bombay in 1870; between\r\nValentia and Heart’s Content, in 1873 and 1874; completing her\r\ncharter to the Telegraphic Construction Company in July, 1875. The\r\namount received for charter was at the rate of £20,000 per annum,\r\nnett form.\r\n\r\nThe last years of this noble vessel were ignominious. She was\r\nchartered in 1886 by “Lewis’s,” who used her for a couple of years as\r\na huge floating advertisement on the Mersey. She afterwards went to\r\nseveral Ports as a “show” ship, and finally returned to the Mersey to\r\nbe broken up on the 20th November, 1888. Her owners at this time were\r\nprobably the only persons who ever realized a handsome profit out of\r\nher during her varied career. The following is a list of the prices\r\nobtained at the sale of the various parts of the hull and equipment:—\r\n\r\nEleven-ton Trotman’s anchor, 33 guineas, in addition to a number of\r\nother anchors, which realized £3 to £7 15s. per ton; oak lifeboat, 2\r\nguineas; cutter, 30s.; iron masts, £9 to £17 10s. each; copper steam\r\npiping, £2,960; gun metal, £6,400; scrap yellow brass, £1,760; sheet\r\nlead, £367 10s.; lead piping, £367 10s.; iron plates forming the\r\nhull, £12,600; iron beams, £2 13s. per ton; scrap rivets, £2 6s. per\r\nton; boiler tubes, £49 7s. 6d.[23]\r\n\r\nSo ended the career of the most celebrated ship of the 19th century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steamship and sailboats]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] “Illustrated London News.”\r\n\r\n[23] The above figures are obtained from “Donaldson’s Engineers’\r\nAnnual,” 1900, by permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  Steam to Australia.—SOPHIA JANE, first steamer from Great Britain\r\n  to Australia, 1831.—The steamship GREAT BRITAIN sails for\r\n  Melbourne, 1852.—Sketch of her after career.—The GOLDEN AGE.—The\r\n  auxiliary screw steamer ROYAL CHARTER.—Sails on her maiden voyage,\r\n  1856.—Totally lost, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first voyage by a steamer ever made between Great Britain and\r\nAustralia was in 1831 by the SOPHIA JANE, a small vessel of 256 tons\r\nburthen and 50 h.p. (see reference to this vessel in the History of\r\nthe Cork Steamship Co., Limited).\r\n\r\nTwenty-one years later the owners of the GREAT BRITAIN, the Liverpool\r\nand Australian Steam Navigation Co. (Messrs. Gibbs, Bright & Co.,\r\nManagers), induced by the great rush of emigrants to the newly\r\ndiscovered Australian goldfields, decided to supplement their “Eagle”\r\nLine of Packets by the addition of screw steamers and issued an\r\nadvertisement as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “Steam from Liverpool to Australia, forming part of the ‘Eagle’\r\n  Line of Packets.\r\n\r\n  The GREAT BRITAIN, S.S., 3,500 tons and 500 h.p., B. R. Matthews,\r\n  E.N., Commander, will be despatched for Melbourne and Sydney,\r\n  N.S.W., calling at the Cape of Good Hope for coals, water and\r\n  fresh provisions, on Saturday, 21st August, 1852, at 1 p.m. This\r\n  magnificent ship, fitted up with every possible convenience,\r\n  has just performed her trial voyage to New York in the most\r\n  satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n  “Fares:—After Saloon, to Melbourne, 70 guineas and upwards. Five\r\n  guineas extra to Sydney, N.S.W.\r\n\r\n  “To Cape of Good Hope, 50 guineas.\r\n\r\n  “Loading Berth, Wellington Dock.\r\n\r\n  “Apply to Gibbs, Bright & Co., Liverpool.”\r\n\r\nThe result must have been exceedingly gratifying to the owners, as\r\nthe GREAT BRITAIN sailed on this her first voyage to the Antipodes\r\nwith upwards of 600 passengers. Ten days later the ship ALBATROSS\r\narrived with the first importation into Liverpool of gold from\r\nAustralia, being 20,000 ozs. consigned to Messrs. Gibbs, Bright & Co.\r\nOn the 23rd November following, her sister ship, the EAGLE, arrived\r\nin the Thames with 150,000 ounces of gold valued at £600,000. The\r\nship DIDO was expected to arrive in a few days, having on board ten\r\nand a half tons of the precious metal, of the enormous value of\r\n£1,120,000.\r\n\r\nThe GREAT BRITAIN arrived at Melbourne on the 10th November, 1852,\r\nafter a splendid run from the Cape of Good Hope of 24 days, her\r\naverage speed having been 284 miles per day. Her engines behaved\r\nsplendidly, and there was no occasion to stop them during the whole\r\nof the time. One death occurred on board, that of a Chinaman who\r\nembarked at St. Helena.\r\n\r\nOwing to the difficulty of obtaining labour to discharge and load the\r\nship at Melbourne, she was detained at that port for three months,\r\nand sailed on her return voyage about the end of January, 1853. On\r\nher arrival at Cape Town she re-filled her bunkers from the REBECCA,\r\na ship which had been sent from Liverpool with a cargo of coal for\r\nthat purpose, and resumed her voyage northwards on the 20th February.\r\n\r\nShe continued to trade with varying success between Liverpool and\r\nAustralia as an auxiliary steamer for 40 years, and in 1882 was\r\nsold to Messrs. Anthony Gibbs, Sons & Co., who took out her engines\r\nand converted her into a sailing ship. Originally she carried six\r\nmasts, two of which had been taken out of her when she was placed on\r\nthe Anglo-Australian station, and when Messrs. Anthony Gibbs, Sons\r\n& Co. purchased her they took out a third mast and rigged her as a\r\nfull-rigged sailing ship. In order to strengthen her hull, they also,\r\nat a very great expense, completely sheathed her frame with wood,\r\nin October, 1882. She sailed on her last voyage from Liverpool in\r\n1886, and put into the Falkland Islands so battered with her battle\r\nwith wind and waves that she was abandoned to the Underwriters as a\r\nconstructive total loss. She was sold by the latter to the Falkland\r\nIslands Co., who used her as a coal hulk.\r\n\r\nOne of her earliest competitors was an American steamer named the\r\nGOLDEN AGE. She was the property of the New York and Australian Steam\r\nNavigation Co., and was intended to ply between Australia and Panama,\r\nand eventually to extend the service to San Francisco. This splendid\r\nvessel excited great interest in Liverpool, at which port she lay for\r\nabout two months prior to sailing for Melbourne.\r\n\r\nShe was very similar in outward appearance to the Collins steamships,\r\nbeing barque rigged with a straight stem, and having her paddle boxes\r\nsituated very far aft. Her dimensions were as follows: length 285\r\nfeet, beam 43 feet 6 inches, and depth 32 feet; 2864 tons register.\r\nShe had a beam engine of somewhat peculiar construction, with a\r\ncylinder of 85 inches diameter, and 12 feet stroke. The boilers\r\nconstituted the chief peculiarity; they were each 40 feet long, and\r\nfitted with furnaces at each end, the smoke funnel ascending from\r\nthe centre. By this arrangement it was claimed that economy both in\r\nspace and fuel was gained. The hull of the ship was built by Mr. W.\r\nH. Brown, New York. The lower frames were of live oak, and the top\r\nframes of locust and cedar. The entire hull was double diagonally\r\nbraced with iron bars, five inches wide, by three quarters of an inch\r\nthick and four feet apart.\r\n\r\nThe GOLDEN AGE had accommodation for 1200 passengers of all classes,\r\nthe steerage being fitted up for 600. There were three saloons, one\r\nabove the other, two of which were panelled in rose, satin, and zebra\r\nwoods; with crimson and gold plush and rich hangings, and adorned\r\nwith mirrors. In the upper saloon the same general arrangement\r\nprevailed, except that instead of satinwood panelling, the sides were\r\nfinished in white and gold. In this saloon were two “family rooms,”\r\none finished in gold, the other in blue. A brief reference to this\r\nsteamer is made in the “Annals of Liverpool” (Gore’s Directory), in\r\nwhich it is stated: “The GOLDEN AGE(s.) sailed from Liverpool, 5th\r\nDecember, 1853, and arrived at Melbourne in 47 days steaming time.”\r\n\r\nOn the 31st July, 1855, there was launched at Sandycroft, on the\r\nRiver Dee, a large clipper ship fitted with auxiliary steam power.\r\nShe was built to the order of the Liverpool and Australian Steam\r\nNavigation Co., the owners of the celebrated GREAT BRITAIN. Her\r\nowners were of opinion that steamers relying entirely upon their\r\nengines, could not be worked so economically as vessels with\r\nauxiliary steam power, and sailing vessels trusting only to their\r\nsails could not be relied upon to make their passages with regularity\r\nand despatch, consequently they determined to combine the two motive\r\npowers and give their vessel the benefit of both.\r\n\r\nThe ROYAL CHARTER, the name given to the new ship, was designed and\r\nbuilt by Mr. Paterson, the builder of the GREAT BRITAIN. She was\r\n235 feet in length over all, 41 feet 6 inches beam, and 26 feet 6\r\ninches depth of hold; 2720 tons burden; could spread 15,000 square\r\nfeet of canvas; and had a pair of direct acting trunk engines of\r\n200 h.p. nominal, constructed by Messrs. Penn, of Greenwich, for\r\nworking an auxiliary screw, so arranged that when not wanted it\r\ncould be completely lifted out of the water, and even (if necessary)\r\nplaced on deck. She had excellent accommodation for passengers. Her\r\nchief saloon was 100 feet long and beautifully fitted up; and the\r\nladies’ cabin, with its large poop windows, and elegant furniture,\r\nwas admirably adapted for its purpose. There were two large bath\r\nrooms for the use of the after saloon passengers, and one three\r\ntimes as large as either of these two for the use of the ’tween deck\r\npassengers. She had seven watertight compartments and tanks capable\r\nof holding 64,000 gallons of water.\r\n\r\nThe ROYAL CHARTER, independently of her steam power, was a\r\nfull-rigged ship, and was the first English vessel to adopt the\r\nAmerican plan of double topsails on each mast. On her trial trips she\r\naveraged a speed of nine knots per hour with her propeller; and under\r\ncanvas only, with a light N.N.E. wind, made fourteen knots per hour.\r\n\r\nShe was well armed, carrying eight guns—four 18 pounders and four 24\r\npounders; besides a large swivel gun on the forecastle, and a good\r\nnumber of Minié rifles for the saloon.\r\n\r\nShe left Liverpool on her maiden voyage to Melbourne on the 16th\r\nApril, 1856, and accomplished the passage in 59 days. She had but a\r\nshort career, for on the 26th October, 1859, this noble ship was\r\ntotally wrecked on the coast of Anglesea. She had almost reached\r\nher home port, inward bound from Australia under the command of\r\nCaptain Taylor, and having on board about 500 persons including\r\npassengers and crew, and a valuable cargo, including gold to the\r\namount of £400,000. She had called at Queenstown, where thirteen of\r\nher passengers disembarked. On her passage up channel she was caught\r\nin a terrific northerly gale, which, driving the current in the\r\nlarge bay between the Ormes Head and Point Lynas, swept the vessel\r\nfrom her course and drove her upon the rock-bound coast off Moelfra\r\nHead, Red Wharf Bay. She struck during the night when no assistance\r\nfrom the shore could be obtained. From 30 to 35 persons only were\r\nsaved out of the 500 on board, and these mainly through the heroic\r\nefforts of Joseph Rodgers, who swam ashore with a line round his\r\nbody. In recognition of his devoted courage, this intrepid seaman was\r\npresented with a gold medal and £5 by the Royal National Lifeboat\r\nInstitution at a meeting held at the Sailors’ Home, Liverpool, on\r\nthe 16th November, 1859, on which occasion the Board of Trade also\r\npresented him with a silver medal and £10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rowboat near shore]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nChina and Steam Navigation.—Opening of the Treaty Ports,\r\n1860.—Auxiliary Steamers first employed.—The SCOTLAND.—The ROBERT\r\nLOWE.—The Holt Line.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treaty ports of the Yang-tse were for the first time opened to\r\nthe ships of the “barbarian nations of the West” in February, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe first foreign merchant vessel to load a cargo at Shanghai for\r\nHankow was the auxiliary screw steamer SCOTLAND, belonging to the\r\nlate W. S. Lindsay, the well-known author of the “History of Merchant\r\nShipping.” She was a vessel of about 1,100 tons gross register, and\r\nwas commanded by Captain A. D. Dundas, R.N. She sailed from Shanghai\r\nwith a full cargo in June, 1860, her draft being 17 feet. She was\r\nsubsequently sold to the Prince of Satsuma, the same purchaser having\r\npreviously, in 1861, purchased her sister ship, the ENGLAND, from\r\nMessrs. W. S. Lindsay & Co.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1863 that any English steamer loaded a cargo direct\r\nfrom Hankow for Great Britain. The third vessel to sail was the\r\nauxiliary screw steamship ROBERT LOWE, also belonging to Messrs.\r\nLindsay. She was a vessel of 1,250 tons gross, with engines of only\r\n80 nominal horse power. Her average speed between Shanghai and\r\nHankow, a distance of 608 miles, was 60 miles per day, but one day\r\nwas lost in changing her propeller, and she anchored every night.\r\nShe sailed from Shanghai on the 8th May, 1863, and came to an anchor\r\noff Hankow on the 18th idem. On the 10th June her cargo arrived\r\nalongside, and on the 23rd June she sailed for Shanghai and London.\r\nShe traversed the distance between Hankow and Shanghai in 57 hours,\r\nthe current being with her. Her cargo for London consisted of 9,568\r\nchests, 234 half-chests, and 2,064 boxes of tea; 535 bales of cotton\r\nand 192 packages of sundries. Her freight amounted to the respectable\r\nsum of £10,315, in addition to which she earned £480 passage money.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 Mr. Alfred Holt, of Liverpool, started a line of steamers to\r\ntrade between England and China, _via_ the Cape of Good Hope. Mr.\r\nHolt was a practical engineer. Having served his apprenticeship, he\r\nwas appointed inspecting engineer to several steamship companies,\r\nand about 1850 commenced as steamship owner with a small coasting\r\nsteamer, the ALPHA. This steamer was succeeded by the CLEATOR and\r\nDUMBARTON YOUTH, sailing between Liverpool, Cumberland Ports, and the\r\nBristol Channel.\r\n\r\nUpon the outbreak of the Crimean War, Mr. Holt secured several\r\nremunerative charters from the Government, and in 1855 he inaugurated\r\nthe first line of steamers between Liverpool and the West Indies. His\r\nfirst steamer in this trade was only 535 tons burden, but she was so\r\nwell supported that in a short time a monthly line of steamers of\r\nlarger capacity and greater power was established.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 Messrs. Leech, Harrison and Forwood, and Messrs. Imrie\r\nand Tomlinson, entered into the same trade, and it was considered\r\ndesirable to form a public company to amalgamate these three\r\nundertakings. A company, under the title of the West India and\r\nPacific Steam Navigation Company, Limited, was consequently formed\r\nfor this purpose, with a capital of £1,250,000, which was at once\r\nsubscribed.\r\n\r\nMr. Holt now directed his energies to the Far East, and in 1865\r\ndespatched his first vessels in the China service, the AGAMEMNON,\r\nAJAX and ACHILLES. These were the first steamers to apply the\r\nprinciple of compound engines to long over-sea voyages. These engines\r\nwere in use in the ships of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company\r\nprior to this, but only in those steamers employed on the Pacific\r\ncoast. The performances of the Holt steamers had been hitherto\r\nconsidered impossible, and even now in the twentieth century would\r\nbe considered remarkable with boats of a similar size. Starting from\r\nLiverpool, they steamed down the South Atlantic, rounded the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, and so on to Mauritius, a distance of 8,500 miles without\r\nstopping. From thence they proceeded to Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong\r\nand Shanghai.\r\n\r\nThese three pioneers of the Anglo-China trade were each of 2,270\r\ntons gross and 1,550 tons net register, with engines of 300 nominal\r\nhorse power, and their principal dimensions were—length, 309 feet;\r\nbeam, 38½ feet; depth of hold to spar deck, 28½ feet. On July 16th,\r\n1869, one of them (the ACHILLES) sailed from Foochow for London _via_\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, and arrived on the 16th September, having\r\nbeen under steam 58 days 9 hours, during which time she travelled\r\n13,552 miles, maintaining an average speed of nearly 9¾ knots\r\nthroughout the whole voyage. This was one of the last voyages made\r\nby the Holt steamers round the Cape, as two months after the arrival\r\nof the ACHILLES at London the Suez Canal was formally opened for\r\nthe merchant steamers of all countries, and from that date all the\r\nsteamers of this company have passed through that waterway on their\r\nvoyages to and from China.\r\n\r\nThe earlier steamers of the fleet were square-rigged on the fore and\r\nmain masts, a good rig when it was desired to take advantage of the\r\nfavourable trade winds and monsoons, which can always be depended\r\nupon for a voyage round the Cape, but found to be unsuitable when the\r\nroute was altered to the Suez Canal. The square sails of the three\r\nsteamers named were, therefore, removed, and the subsequent steamers\r\nhave been constructed with pole masts only.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fleet is styled the Ocean Steamship Company, it is\r\npopularly known as the Holt, or “Blue Funnel” Line, and has only\r\nrecently been formed into a limited company.\r\n\r\nThe Holt Line steamers do not carry passengers between Great Britain\r\nand China, but they are great favourites with the Moslem pilgrims, of\r\nwhom they carry large numbers on their journeys to and from Mecca.\r\n\r\nAbout 1891 the Ocean Steamship Company established a monthly service\r\nof mail and passenger steamers between Singapore and West Australian\r\nPorts, and in 1901 a direct service of steamers from Glasgow to\r\nAustralian Ports was opened by the despatch of the steamer ORESTES.\r\n\r\nA controlling interest in the China Mutual Steam Navigation Company,\r\nLimited, was purchased by, and the fleet of that company transferred\r\nto, the Holt Company on the 1st July, 1902, with which addition to\r\nthe “Blue Funnel” fleet extended operations were undertaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.

REA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE HISTORY OF A GLASGOW STEAMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The FERRET s.s. chartered by Henderson & Co.—Sails\r\nfor the Mediterranean and disappears.—BENTON s.s. sails with a cargo\r\nof coffee from Santos, and also disappears.—Seizure of INDIA s.s. at\r\nMelbourne.—Proved to be missing steamer FERRET, _alias_ BENTON.]\r\n\r\nDecidedly the most dramatic incident ever recorded in the annals\r\nof steam navigation was the theft of the steamer FERRET and the\r\npiratical seizure and sale of her cargo of coffee.\r\n\r\nThe FERRET was a screw steamer measuring 170 feet 9 inches in\r\nlength, 23 feet 2 inches beam, and 12 feet 7 inches depth; builders’\r\nmeasurement 439 tons, with a probable carrying capacity of 400 tons\r\ndeadweight cargo, in addition to coal in bunkers. She had compound\r\nengines of 90 h.p. nominal, and her reputed speed was 12 knots per\r\nhour. She was built on the Clyde in 1871, by the well-known firm of\r\nJ. & G. Thomson, for Messrs. G. & J. Burns, of Glasgow, from whom\r\nthe Highland Railway Co. purchased her for their mail and passenger\r\nservice, and she held a Board of Trade certificate for 200 passengers.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators who succeeded in stealing this vessel, laid their\r\nplans with great care and attention to details, and carried them out\r\nwith marvellous audacity. One of them took an office in Gracechurch\r\nStreet, London, and obtained a supply of printed stationery,\r\ndescribing himself as “Henderson & Co., Ship Brokers, &c.” He also\r\nopened an account with the ... Bank, in the name of “Smith,” taking\r\ncare until his plans were perfected to keep a respectable balance to\r\nhis credit.\r\n\r\nEarly in October, 1880, the plot had ripened, and one of the gang,\r\nrepresenting himself to be “Mr. Walker, purser of the FERRET S.S.,”\r\ncalled at the office of Douglas & Co., Union Street, a leading\r\nship-chandler’s firm in Glasgow, and ordered a large quantity of\r\nexpensive ship-stores. The stores were for the account of Mr. Smith,\r\nwho was referred to as a relative of Mr. W. H. Smith, late First Lord\r\nof the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nNaturally references were required and were freely given. Mr. Smith\r\nhad chartered from the Highland Railway Co. the steamer FERRET for a\r\nsix months’ cruise in the Mediterranean, his wife having been ordered\r\nby her doctor to take a long sea voyage. The FERRET was then in J. &\r\nG. Thomson’s yard, being overhauled preparatory to the cruise. Both\r\nof these firms could be referred to, as well as Mr. Smith’s bankers,\r\nand Messrs. Henderson & Co., Ship Brokers, Gracechurch Street,\r\nLondon. The bankers were written to, and replied that Mr. Smith had\r\nan account with their bank. Henderson & Co. were also applied to, and\r\nof course gave a very favourable account of Smith.\r\n\r\nThe merchants being satisfied with the result of their enquiries,\r\nsupplied the stores, which included an excellent selection of\r\nfirst-class wines specially brought from London. The account, which\r\namounted to £1,490, was presented to Walker, who gave a bill at three\r\nmonths endorsed by Smith. It is to be presumed that the first-half\r\nmonth’s charter was paid as customary in cash in advance, because the\r\nconspirators having got possession of the FERRET were in no violent\r\nhurry to get her out of British waters.\r\n\r\nAbout the 20th October, William Griffin joined the steamer at\r\nGreenock as chief engineer. Although Griffin was not placed on trial,\r\nyet it is to be noted that he had a prior acquaintance with Walker,\r\nwho had introduced him to Smith. It is also undeniable that without\r\nthe assistance of Griffin and the ship’s carpenter, the alterations\r\nwhich were made in the steamer could not have been effected.\r\n\r\nFrom Greenock, the FERRET sailed in charge of a crew of “runners” to\r\nCardiff, Robert Wright, alias Carlyon (a confederate) being master,\r\nand Walker, alias Wallace, acting as purser. The steamer arrived at\r\nCardiff on the 22nd October and remained there for three days, taking\r\nin a cargo of coals for ship’s use. The coals, of course, being paid\r\nfor by valueless bills on London. At Cardiff the “runners” were\r\ndischarged and a fresh crew, strangers to the FERRET, were shipped.\r\nSmith (otherwise Henderson) also embarked at Cardiff, accompanied by\r\n“Mrs. Smith.”\r\n\r\nThe FERRET sailed from Cardiff on the 25th October and put into\r\nMilford Haven, probably from stress of weather, where she remained\r\nfor about a week. She left Milford on the 1st November, ostensibly\r\nfor Marseilles. In pursuance of this report, she passed through the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar on the morning of the 11th of the same month,\r\nand showing her number, requested to be reported.\r\n\r\nHaving steamed out of sight of the signalling station, the crew were\r\nset to work to change the colour of the funnel from white to black,\r\nand of the boats (with the exception of two) from blue to white, and\r\nat night, with her lights screened, the FERRET returned westwards\r\nthrough the straits. While passing through, the two boats that had\r\nnot been altered, some empty casks, several life-belts, and other\r\narticles, all having the steamer’s name painted on them, were thrown\r\noverboard, for the purpose of making it appear that the vessel had\r\nfoundered. So evident did this seem that as a matter of fact the\r\nunderwriters paid the Highland Railway Co. their claim for the total\r\nloss of the steamer.\r\n\r\nThat same night all the crew were sent aft to the saloon, where Smith\r\nmade a speech to them, in which he stated that he was a political\r\nrefugee from the United States; that he had purchased the FERRET to\r\nuse partly as a yacht, and partly for trading; that after he had\r\ntraded for some time he would sell the boat, and make it worth their\r\nwhile to keep his secret; but on the other hand, if any of them\r\ndisclosed anything they saw or heard on board, he would blow their\r\nbrains out. The crew, when arrested, alleged that it was the fear of\r\nthis threat which prevented them giving information, when in port, of\r\nwhat they knew to be suspicious actions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FERRET S.S.]\r\n\r\nAvoiding the Canary Islands, presumably as being too much frequented\r\nby British shipping, the conspirators kept away to the southward\r\nuntil they reached St. Vincent, C.V. Entering the harbour, they\r\nanchored there for several days, during which they took in fresh\r\nwater, and a supply of pigs, poultry, fruit and vegetables, paying\r\nfor them in their usual manner by means of worthless bills.\r\n\r\nThe “Times” (23rd June, 1881) Sydney correspondent states that after\r\nleaving St. Vincent the vessel’s name was altered to the BENTON. But\r\nthis seems most improbable, as it would be apparent that the FERRET\r\ndid not founder in the Mediterranean, and further it would have left\r\na clue by which she could easily have been traced. The truth probably\r\nis, that the alteration was made immediately she got clear of the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar. Be this as it may, the BENTON arrived at\r\nSantos on the 26th December.\r\n\r\nAt Santos, Smith went on shore and lost no time in opening\r\nnegotiations with the local shipping agents, to whom he stated\r\nthat the BENTON was from Cape Town in ballast, bound for England.\r\nThe negotiations resulted in the shipment of 3,992 bags of coffee,\r\nconsigned to various consignees at Marseilles. Having obtained this\r\ncargo, the BENTON sailed from Santos on the 11th January, 1881, but\r\ninstead of proceeding to Marseilles she steamed direct to Cape Town.\r\n\r\nWhile the BENTON was steaming across the South Atlantic, the Glasgow\r\nholders of the bill for £1,490 received some information which\r\nmade them uneasy, and on presentation of the bill when due, it was\r\ndishonoured. The account was closed, the balance had been withdrawn,\r\nand the acceptor’s whereabouts were unknown. The holders then\r\napplied to Henderson and Co., but the letter was returned—addressees\r\n“gone, no address.” They then wrote to the Highland Railway Co., and\r\nreceived a reply from the Secretary to the effect that the Highland\r\nRailway Co. had already done all in their power to trace the FERRET,\r\nin their own interests, having received no charter money from the\r\ncharterers since the vessel sailed from the Clyde. They had been\r\nin communication with Lloyd’s and the Board of Trade, and through\r\nBritish Consuls and Lloyd’s agents, enquiries had been made all over\r\nthe world. About ten days before the receipt of the merchants’ letter\r\nthe Highland Railway Co. had heard that the FERRET had arrived at\r\nMalta, but on cabling there had received a reply denying the report.\r\nThey had cabled a second time, ordering the vessel to be seized at\r\nMalta in the event of her putting in there.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the BENTON was nearing Cape Town, laden with coffee shipped\r\nat Santos. During the voyage further changes had been effected in\r\nthe appearance of the vessel, and the name INDIA was substituted for\r\nBENTON. The original name (FERRET) had previously been filed off the\r\nship’s bell, and now, as a further precaution the ship’s number on\r\nthe main hatch combings was altered to 77,942. The INDIA put into\r\nCape Town on the 29th January, and at once began to discharge her\r\ncargo.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators had provided themselves with a printing press, and\r\nhad all necessaries on board, as well as Revenue Stamps of various\r\nnations, by which they were able to manufacture the vouchers and\r\ndocuments necessary to the success of their frauds. At Cape Town,\r\nSmith produced an invoice with a printed heading, purporting to be an\r\ninvoice for 3,992 bags coffee sold by coffee planters at La Guayra\r\n(a small port in Venezuela) to C. S. Henderson & Co., and with it\r\na receipt for the amount duly stamped. He succeeded in selling the\r\ncargo, and realised by the sale of it about £11,000. He had to accept\r\nin part payment bills to the extent of £8,000, drawn on the Standard\r\nBank, Clement’s Lane, London, payable nine months after date. It\r\nis satisfactory to know that the frauds were discovered before the\r\nbills matured, and payment of them was stopped. After the discharge\r\nof the cargo, Smith tried to sell the steamer, but not succeeding in\r\nhis attempt, he shipped a quantity of coal, and sailed on the 14th\r\nFebruary for the Mauritius. The conspirators arrived at Mauritius on\r\nthe 1st March, but did not succeed in getting any plunder there, and\r\nso they “cleared out for Guam.”\r\n\r\nThe next port they entered was Port Albany in Western Australia,\r\nfrom whence they steamed direct to Melbourne. Here Wright and\r\nWalker offered the steamer for sale, but received no offers. While\r\nin Melbourne, several circumstances made the Customs officers and\r\nthe Harbour Police suspect that there was something wrong about the\r\nvessel. It was observed that the fires were always banked so that\r\nsteam could be got up at the shortest notice. Captain Wright never\r\nleft the steamer, and none of the crew (except Walker, the purser)\r\nwere ever allowed “shore leave.” The Customs authorities instructed\r\none of their officers to make a special investigation of the matter,\r\nand he reported that there was no steamer of the tonnage given\r\nregistered at Lloyd’s in the name of INDIA, but that the particulars\r\nof tonnage and dimensions corresponded with the register of the\r\nmissing steamer FERRET.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Arrest.]\r\n\r\nNoting all these suspicious circumstances the Customs authorities\r\ndetermined on prompt action. Requisitioning two crews of the Water\r\nPolice, as it was feared there might be violent opposition on the\r\npart of the steamer’s crew, the Commissioner of Customs, on the\r\n27th April, seized the vessel. Fortunately their anticipations as\r\nto resistance were not realised, the crew surrendering without\r\nopposition. Although the authorities had been extremely cautious in\r\ntheir enquiries, it is evident that the conspirators became aware of\r\nwhat was being done, for when the steamer was seized, Smith, “Mrs.\r\nSmith,” and Captain Wright had fled. The previous day Smith and Mrs.\r\nSmith removed from their cabin a number of articles, and amongst them\r\ntwo heavy iron-bound boxes which were never traced. Smith succeeded\r\nin getting away from Melbourne to a distant township, but was\r\narrested. Mrs. Smith, who had disappeared for a time, when she heard\r\nof his arrest reappeared and visited him in prison. The object of\r\nher visit may be surmised from the fact that shortly after her visit\r\nSmith tried to escape by filing through one of the bars of his prison\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wright had found a retreat in a Melbourne sailors’\r\nlodging-house, but having got drunk and quarrelled with his landlady,\r\nhe was thrown out, and arrested for being drunk and disorderly. When\r\nthe charge was being booked at the police station, he was recognised\r\nas the missing master of the steamer, for whom the police were\r\nsearching.\r\n\r\nConfirmation of the suspicions which induced the Commissioner of\r\nCustoms to seize the steamer was speedily obtained. Traces of fraud\r\nwere quickly discovered on the ship’s hull and appointments, and\r\nin the ship’s books and papers—some of the latter being found in\r\nvery unusual places of deposit. Between the leaves of the log-book\r\na seaman’s “advance note” was found with the name of the FERRET\r\non it. There was also found a MSS. cypher code, by means of which\r\ncommunication might be made between those in the vessel and others\r\non shore. It also serves to show the unscrupulous character of the\r\ncriminals and the extreme length to which they were prepared to go.\r\nOne or two quotations will illustrate the truth of this assertion:—\r\n\r\n“Accept charter referred to and lose vessel before you arrive in\r\nport. Don’t fail.”\r\n\r\n“Get out of port the best way you can, but sink the ship, before you\r\nallow them to stop her.”\r\n\r\n“Destroy all papers, &c., and sink ship if possible, or burn her, and\r\nget away. Make best of your way over here.”\r\n\r\n“Things going wrong. Mate not to be trusted; shall get rid of him.”\r\n\r\n“Things going wrong with some of the crew; must get rid of them.”\r\n\r\n“Things going wrong with the whole of the crew; must get rid of them.”\r\n\r\n“Lost vessel; landed here to day; all hands forward lost.”\r\n\r\n“Game is all up; all discovered; destroy or hide everything, and make\r\nyourself scarce; communicate with me through the arranged channel.”\r\n\r\nAmong the papers seized was a card of a Dr. Bonefin. Now a swindler\r\nof this name—not a common one—shortly before the arrival of the\r\nFERRET, was convicted for obtaining goods under false pretences\r\nfrom a number of Melbourne jewellers, and was sentenced to a term\r\nof imprisonment in Pentridge Gaol. In the cypher code referred to\r\nMelbourne figures as 51, so that it is extremely probable that\r\nBonefin was one of the conspirators on shore.\r\n\r\nA Cabinet Meeting of the Victorian Government was held on the 9th\r\nMay, and on the following morning the opinion of the Attorney-General\r\nwas published as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “The Government of Victoria seized the FERRET, which entered this\r\n  port (Melbourne) as the INDIA, in the interests of the rightful\r\n  owners, domiciled apparently in Great Britain. At the present time\r\n  no one in Victoria is in a position to show this Government such\r\n  a title to the FERRET as would clear the Government from possible\r\n  liability. It appears to me that the Hon. the Commissioner of\r\n  Trade and Customs should hold the FERRET till proper papers are\r\n  produced in Melbourne by a legally authorised agent of the actual\r\n  owners, whose title should be clearly proved by the needful papers\r\n  from England. This being done, and delivery charges paid, the ship\r\n  should be delivered. If it is deemed desirable to expedite delivery\r\n  of the ship, this Government is entitled to require that the Board\r\n  of Trade of London should give a certificate as to the owners.\r\n  Such certificate, along with an indemnity to pay all costs, and an\r\n  indemnity by the owners, should be deposited with the Agent-General\r\n  for Victoria, London, who should telegraph any instructions the\r\n  owners may wish to give as to the way they desire the ship to be\r\n  dealt with, and this Government should then act accordingly. At the\r\n  same time it would be well to learn whether the Imperial Government\r\n  wished to take proceedings against any of the offenders, and if\r\n  so, what course it intended to take. All necessary documents and\r\n  evidence should be transmitted without delay. The master, also the\r\n  person who represents himself as the owner, and another person are\r\n  charged here with forging the register of the ship, that offence\r\n  having been committed with a view to a fraudulent sale.”\r\n\r\nEventually the three criminals arrested, viz.:—Smith (alias\r\nHenderson, alias Benard), Wright (alias Carlyon) and Walker (alias\r\nWallace), were indicted on three counts:—\r\n\r\n1st. Conspiracy to defraud the owners of the FERRET, the Highland\r\nRailway Co.\r\n\r\n2nd. Conspiracy to defraud intending purchasers of the FERRET in\r\nMelbourne; and\r\n\r\n3rd. Conspiracy to deceive the Commissioner of Trade and Customs, by\r\nentering the vessel in a false name, and to obtain a certificate of\r\nsale under which the vessel could have been sold in that port.\r\n\r\nThey were all acquitted on the first count, but convicted on the\r\nsecond and third. Smith and Walker were each sentenced to seven\r\nyears’ penal servitude, and Wright to three and a half years.\r\nThis result is most remarkable. No mention is made of the frauds\r\nperpetrated at Glasgow, Cardiff and St. Vincent, C.V.; nor of the\r\nsteps taken (if any) to secure the confederates on shore.\r\n\r\nAs for the unfortunate crew, who had received no wages, they obtained\r\na temporary refuge in the Melbourne Sailors’ Home. The after history\r\nof the FERRET is briefly told. She was purchased in 1885 by the\r\nAdelaide Steamship Company, Currie Street, Adelaide, South Australia,\r\nand is at the present date employed by that company in the Australian\r\ncoasting service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nAnglo-Canadian Steamship Companies.—Allan Line.—Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway Co.—Dominion Line.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of the Imperial Government the Government of\r\nCanada advertised in June, 1852, for tenders for the conveyance of\r\nmails between the United Kingdom and Quebec and Montreal in summer,\r\nand between the United Kingdom and Portland, Maine, in winter. The\r\ncontract was secured by Messrs. McKean, McLarty and Lamont, of\r\nLiverpool, who formed a company, and despatched their first steamer,\r\nthe GENOVA, a small vessel of 500 tons register, in the spring of\r\n1853. The sailings were continued, but with no great regularity,\r\nfor about eighteen months. In addition to the steamer named, the\r\nCLEOPATRA, of 1467 tons, the OTTAWA, and two chartered steamers, one\r\nthe CHARITY, built for the African Steamship Co., and the other the\r\nCANADIAN, chartered from Messrs. Allan Brothers, were engaged in the\r\nservice. On the outbreak of the Crimean War the OTTAWA and CHARITY\r\nwere taken off the Canadian service for the conveyance of troops to\r\nthe Crimea, and in 1855 the CLEOPATRA was despatched from London to\r\nMelbourne.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Canadian Mail Service proving unprofitable—a natural result\r\nfrom the way in which it was conducted—it was transferred to the\r\nMessrs. Allan, who undertook to build a fleet specially for this\r\ntrade, and to maintain a fortnightly service to Quebec in summer,\r\nand a monthly service to Portland, Maine, in winter, for the annual\r\nsubsidy of £24,000. The Allan mail service to Canada commenced\r\nin April, 1856. A weekly service was instituted in 1859, and has\r\nbeen continued until the present day. The first four steamers of\r\nthe line were built by Messrs. Denny, Dumbarton, and one of them,\r\nthe ANGLO-SAXON, made a passage in nine days five hours—which was\r\nconsidered a record in those days. The HIBERNIAN, built in 1861,\r\nwas the first steamer in the Atlantic trade to have a spar deck,\r\ncovering the main deck from stem to stern, affording shelter for the\r\npassengers in heavy weather, and found to be so advantageous that it\r\nhas been adopted by all the other first-class Atlantic companies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. TUNISIAN. Allan Line.]\r\n\r\nThe time on passage was further reduced by the POLYNESIAN in 1872.\r\nOn her first voyage this steamer made the passage between Quebec and\r\nLondonderry in seven days eighteen hours and fifty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the BUENOS AYREAN made her appearance. This vessel is\r\nremarkable as being the first Atlantic liner constructed of steel,\r\nthe material of which all ocean-going steamers are now built.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 the PARISIAN was launched, a steamer which has always been\r\na favourite on the route. She has accommodation for 200 first, 100\r\nsecond, and 500 third-class passengers, and is popularly known as the\r\n“ladies’ ship,” a title bestowed upon her because she is credited\r\nwith having carried a larger proportion of lady passengers than\r\nany other line. The three crack boats of the present fleet are the\r\ntwin-screw steamers BAVARIAN, TUNISIAN, and IONIAN. The first of\r\nthese sailed on her maiden voyage to Canada in August, 1899, and she\r\nwas followed by the TUNISIAN in April, 1900. The IONIAN, the latest\r\naddition to the passenger fleet, is a twin-screw steamer of 9,000\r\ntons. So far as outward appearance and internal arrangements go these\r\nare sister ships, though the TUNISIAN is 10,576 tons, against the\r\n9,000 tons of the IONIAN.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of these magnificent steamships are as follows:—length\r\n520 feet, beam 60 feet, and depth 43 feet.\r\n\r\nAll the passenger vessels of the Allan fleet are lighted by\r\nelectricity, and they are being fitted with the Marconi system of\r\nwireless telegraphy.\r\n\r\nThe new ship (to be named the VICTORIAN), now being built for the\r\nline in Belfast is to be supplied with Turbine Engines. She will be\r\nthe first transatlantic liner to be fitted with marine engines of\r\nthis type.\r\n\r\nBy its recent purchase (1903) from Messrs. Elder, Dempster and Co.,\r\nof fifteen large and full-powered ocean steamships, the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway Co. has placed itself in the front rank of steamship\r\nowners. Prior to this deal, it owned the steamers ALBERTA, ATHABASKA,\r\nMANITOBA, MICHIGAN, and ONTARIO, all of which plied on the great\r\ninland lakes of Canada as adjuncts to its train services. These\r\nsteamers ranged from 498 tons net register to 2,768 tons.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, the Naval Construction and Armaments Co., at Barrow, built\r\nthree magnificent mail and passenger steamers for the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway. These steamers, the EMPRESS OF CHINA, EMPRESS OF\r\nINDIA, and EMPRESS OF JAPAN, are almost identical in measurement,\r\ncapacity and speed. They are each 455 feet 6 inches in length; 51\r\nfeet 2 inches beam; and 33 feet 1 inch depth of hold. They are\r\npropelled by twin screws driven by a pair of triple expansion engines\r\nof 1,167 horse power. These three steamers have maintained since\r\n1891, a regular mail service between Vancouver, B.C., the Pacific\r\nterminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and Japan and China.\r\n\r\nThe steamers TARTAR and ATHENIAN, two smaller and less powerful boats\r\nare despatched, as intermediate steamers, at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nFrom Liverpool to Hong Kong—over sea and over land—the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway Co. stretches a long unbroken line nearly 12,000\r\nmiles in length.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Messrs. Flinn, Main & Montgomery despatched the ST. LOUIS\r\nfrom Liverpool to New Orleans. She was the pioneer steamer of a\r\nCompany promoted by the firm named for the purpose of trading between\r\nLiverpool and New Orleans, and called the Liverpool and Mississippi\r\nSteamship Co. The views of the promoters becoming enlarged, they\r\nchanged the name of the Company in 1872 to the Mississippi and\r\nDominion Steamship Co., and entered into the Canadian trade. For many\r\nyears the steamers of the Line sailed only between Liverpool and\r\nQuebec and Montreal, but about 1891 a second service was established,\r\nwith sailings to and from Bristol and the ports on the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Messrs. Flinn, Main & Montgomery retired, and the two\r\nsections of the business were taken over—the Liverpool service by\r\nMessrs. Richards, Mills & Co., and the Bristol service by Messrs.\r\nElder, Dempster & Co.; the former continued to be known as the\r\n“Dominion Line,” but the latter service was merged into the Beaver\r\nLine, and as such formed part of the fleet purchased by the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway Co., referred to in a preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the Dominion Line was acquired by the American Shipping\r\nCombine, and in October, 1903, a further change was made by the\r\ntransference of the latest and best steamers of the fleet to the\r\nWhite Star flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nRailway Companies as Steamship Owners.—South Eastern and\r\nChatham.—London, Brighton and South Coast.—London and South\r\nWestern.—Great Western.—London and North Western.—Lancashire and\r\nYorkshire.—Stranraer and Larne.—Caledonian.—Glasgow and South\r\nWestern.—North British.—Great Central.—Great Eastern.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are in Great Britain, as well as in the United States of\r\nAmerica, many steamship lines which are either owned or controlled\r\nby railway corporations. On the south coast of England, from Harwich\r\nto Falmouth inclusive, almost the whole of the Anglo-continental\r\npassenger traffic is held by the great railway companies, who have\r\nmade the various ports along that stretch of coast their termini.\r\nIn the North Country, both on the east and west coasts, with a few\r\nimportant exceptions, the cross-channel and over-sea traffic is\r\noperated by steamship companies, which, while running in connection\r\nwith the railway systems of their respective ports, are entirely\r\nseparate and independent undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe South Eastern and Chatham Railway Co. has now running between\r\nDover and Calais, the new turbine steamer THE QUEEN, and the fast and\r\nlarge paddle steamers EMPRESS, VICTORIA, DOVER, CALAIS, LORD WARDEN,\r\nLE NORD, and LE PAS DE CALAIS.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the same Company’s service via Folkestone and\r\nBoulogne, the fast and powerful steamers MABEL GRACE, PRINCESS OF\r\nWALES, and DUCHESS OF YORK are employed.\r\n\r\nThe London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Co. has also added this\r\nyear (1903) a turbine steamer to its fleet of fast steamers plying\r\nbetween Newhaven and Dieppe. In addition to the turbine steamer\r\nreferred to, the fleet at present includes the following powerful\r\n21-knot vessels:—ARUNDEL, CALVADOS, PARIS, ROUEN, and TROUVILLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROYAL MAIL S.

WELSFORD & CO.]\r\n\r\nThe London and South Western Railway Co. has a large fleet of about\r\ntwenty powerful steamers, with which it maintains daily services\r\nbetween Southampton and Havre and tri-weekly services between\r\nSouthampton and Cherbourg, and Southampton and the Channel Islands.\r\n\r\nThe Great Western Railway Co. from its southern terminus, Weymouth,\r\nruns the Mail Steamers ANTELOPE, GAZELLE, IBEX, LYNX, REINDEER, and\r\nROEBUCK, to the Channel Islands and Brittany; and from its western\r\nterminus, Milford, the Mail Steamers GREAT WESTERN, LIMERICK, and\r\nWATERFORD, to Waterford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARUNDEL. London, Brighton and South Coast Ry. Co.]\r\n\r\nFrom Holyhead the London and North Western Railway Co. maintain\r\npassenger services to Dublin and Greenore. It is also interested with\r\nthe Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co. in the Mail Steamers sailing\r\nnightly between Fleetwood and Belfast.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co. purchased from the\r\nDrogheda Steampacket Company, for the sum of £80,000, the entire\r\nfleet of the latter Company, consisting of five paddle steamers\r\nengaged in the Liverpool and Drogheda Service. The Drogheda\r\nSteampacket Company was one of the oldest Irish steampacket\r\ncompanies, having maintained a steampacket service between Liverpool\r\nand Drogheda for upwards of sixty years. The Lancashire and\r\nYorkshire Railway Co. is also a partner in the Fleetwood and Belfast\r\nMail Service, and has recently extended the sailings of the Fleetwood\r\nsteamers to Londonderry.\r\n\r\nA Joint Committee representing several railway companies operate a\r\nMail Service between Stranraer and Larne. The paddle steamer PRINCESS\r\nVICTORIA or PRINCESS MAY sails twice daily during the summer months,\r\nand once daily during the winter months to and from Stranraer and\r\nLarne, making the passage each way in about two hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLEN SANNOX. Glasgow and South-Western Ry. Co.]\r\n\r\nOn the Firth of Clyde the Caledonian Railway Co. are interested\r\nin the handsome steamers of the Caledonian Steam Packet Co. These\r\nvessels carry a cream coloured funnel, and sail from Ardrossan to\r\nGourock and Wemyss Bay. All the watering places on the Firth are\r\nserved by the respective fleets of the various railway companies.\r\n\r\nThe Glasgow and South Western Railway Company owns, and works from\r\nPrince’s Pier, Gourock, a fleet of swift steamers distinguished by\r\ntheir slate coloured hulls, with red funnels and black tops. The\r\nfleet includes the GLEN ROSA, GLEN SANNOX, JUNO, JUPITER, MARS,\r\nMERCURY, MINERVA, NEPTUNE, and others.\r\n\r\nThe North British Railway Company is the premier Railway Company of\r\nScotland; its mileage amounts to 1,303 miles. In conjunction with\r\nthe Great Northern and North Eastern Railway Companies it forms the\r\n“East Coast Route” from England to Scotland, and the fastest booked\r\n“Railway run” in the Kingdom is on this route. As an important\r\nadjunct to its railway system, the North British Railway Co. employ\r\non the Firth of Clyde (making Craigendoran the headquarters), the\r\nwell-known paddle passenger steamers LADY CLARE, LADY ROWENA, LUCY\r\nASHTON, RED GAUNTLET, TALISMAN, WAVERLEY, and others; and between\r\nSilloth and Liverpool the screw cargo steamers ALBATROSS and\r\nKITTIWAKE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCY ASHTON. North British Ry. Co.]\r\n\r\nNo Railway-owned steamers ply on the east coast of Scotland, but from\r\nGrimsby the Great Central Railway Co. have a large fleet of passenger\r\nand cargo steamers sailing regularly to various continental ports.\r\nIn July, 1865, this Company (then known as the Manchester, Sheffield\r\nand Lincolnshire Railway Co.) purchased the Anglo-French Steamship\r\nCo.’s fleet of boats, and started running steamers from Grimsby to\r\nHamburg. The following April the Railway Company commenced a service\r\nof steamers between Grimsby and Rotterdam, and in August, 1867,\r\nthe service was extended to Antwerp. At the present time the Great\r\nCentral Railway Co. possesses a fleet of fourteen powerful steamers\r\ntrading regularly between Grimsby and the continental ports named.\r\n\r\nThe railway company remaining to be mentioned as a steamship owning\r\ncompany is the Great Eastern Railway Company—the Royal British Mail\r\nRoute to Holland.\r\n\r\nThe steamers of this Company have been especially built for the\r\nContinental service. The Royal Mail steamers AMSTERDAM, BERLIN,\r\nCHELMSFORD, DRESDEN, and the VIENNA, run on the Harwich-Hook of\r\nHolland route. They are powerful twin-screw ocean-going ships of\r\n5,000 indicated horse-power, capable of steaming 18 knots an hour,\r\neach with two distinct sets of engines, so that in case of accident\r\nto one set the vessel can proceed with the other.\r\n\r\nThe passenger accommodation is similar to that on the latest Atlantic\r\nLiners, a special feature being the large number of private cabins\r\nfor two passengers. The ships are fitted with electric light, and all\r\nlatest passenger comforts, including dining, smoking, and ladies’\r\nsaloons, and separate sleeping berths.\r\n\r\nThe vessels running on the Harwich-Antwerp route are similar to those\r\non the Hook of Holland service.\r\n\r\nIn common with all Railway Companies’ steamers, the Company’s vessels\r\nsail under the British flag, and are subject to the British Board of\r\nTrade stringent regulations as to safety and life-saving appliances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steamship]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTurbine Steamers.—TURBINIA.—KING EDWARD.—QUEEN ALEXANDRA.—The\r\nQUEEN.—The EMERALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE latest development of the marine engine is the Marine Steam\r\nTurbine, the invention of the Hon. C. A. Parsons, F.R.S., brother of\r\nthe present Earl of Rosse, and a son of the builder of the famous\r\n“Birr” telescope, the largest reflecting telescope ever built.\r\n\r\nThe first vessel ever fitted with the new type of engine was\r\nappropriately named the TURBINIA. This vessel is only 100 feet long\r\nby 9 feet beam and of a total displacement of 44½ tons, but she is\r\nsome ten knots faster than any boat afloat of the same dimensions.\r\nAlthough the weight of her main engines is only about 4 tons, and\r\nthe total weight of machinery, screws, and shafting, tanks, etc., is\r\nonly 22 tons, she develops the enormous power of 2,100 I.H.T., being\r\nalmost 100 H.P. per ton of machinery.\r\n\r\nProf. Ewing, in April, 1895, made some trials of the TURBINIA on the\r\nTyne, the highest speed then recorded being 32·75 knots, but in June\r\nof the same year a speed of 34½ knots was obtained at Cowes.\r\n\r\nThree turbines are used for driving the vessel—high pressure,\r\nintermediate and low pressure. Each turbine driving direct on to a\r\nseparate propeller shaft. Reversing is obtained by means of one or\r\nmore separate turbines connected to the same shafts as the propelling\r\nturbines and working in a vacuum when the boat is going ahead.\r\n\r\nSeveral torpedo destroyers and three yachts have been fitted with\r\nParsons’ turbine engines. The first mercantile vessel to be so fitted\r\nwas the KING EDWARD, built by Messrs. Denny Brothers, Dumbarton, in\r\n1901.\r\n\r\nOn her trial trip she attained a speed of 20½ knots, and during her\r\nfirst season on the Firth of Clyde (1901) she sailed 12,116 knots\r\nin 79 days on a coal consumption of 1,429 tons, at an average speed\r\nof 18½ knots per hour. So satisfied were her owners with her, that\r\nthey gave an order to the same builders and engineers for a somewhat\r\nlarger vessel for the following season.\r\n\r\nThe new (1902) turbine steamer is the QUEEN ALEXANDRA, a three-deck\r\npassenger steamer intended also for the Firth of Clyde passenger\r\nservice. She is 270 feet long, by 32 feet beam, and depth 11 feet 6\r\ninches. She has two funnels, but only one pole mast. Her main deck\r\nis completely covered in from the bow to aft of the engine room, and\r\nabove the spar deck she carries a shade deck 100 feet in length, to\r\nwhich passengers have access, and under which shelter is provided in\r\nwet weather.\r\n\r\nLike her sister vessel, the KING EDWARD, the main engines of the\r\nQUEEN ALEXANDRA consist of three separate turbines, each driving\r\nits own shaft, the centre turbine being high-pressure, and the two\r\nside turbines low-pressure. The velocity of the centre shaft is\r\nabout 700, and of each of the side shafts 1,000 revolutions per\r\nminute. On account of the high velocity at which the shafts revolve\r\nit is necessary to increase the number of propellers driven, and\r\nthe turbine steamers, therefore, have five small propellers each,\r\none on the centre shaft, and two each on the outside shafts. On the\r\nbuilders’ trials the QUEEN ALEXANDRA exceeded the speed of the KING\r\nEDWARD by a knot and a quarter. Her actual speed was 21·63 knots,\r\nequal to about 25 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nTwo Channel steamers designed to carry passengers and mails, and to\r\nbe fitted with Parsons’ marine steam turbine engines, are now (1903)\r\nbeing built on the Clyde by Messrs. Wm. Denny and Brothers.\r\n\r\nOf these, one, the QUEEN, is to the order of the South Eastern and\r\nChatham Railway Co. She will be 310 feet long and 40 feet broad; and\r\nshe is to maintain a speed of at least 21 knots. The average time\r\noccupied at present on the passage between Dover and Calais is 65\r\nminutes, but the new vessel is expected to reduce the time to 50 or\r\neven 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe mode of propulsion is practically the same as that on the QUEEN\r\nALEXANDRA, namely, three shafts carrying five propellers.\r\n\r\nThe other Channel steamer referred to as being built is intended for\r\nthe London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Co.’s service between\r\nNewhaven and Dieppe. Her dimensions are, length 280 feet, beam 34\r\nfeet, draft 22 feet; with a gross tonnage of 1,100 tons.\r\n\r\nThe EMERALD, one of the three yachts referred to at the beginning\r\nof this chapter, is the first vessel fitted with turbine machinery\r\nthat ever crossed the Atlantic. She arrived at New York, after\r\nencountering tempestuous weather on the passage, on the 6th May,\r\n1903. Her qualities as a sea-boat were severely tested during the\r\nvoyage, with entirely satisfactory results. She was built for Sir\r\nChristopher Furness, M.P., by Messrs. Alex. Stephen & Sons, Limited,\r\nof Linthouse, and fitted with machinery by the Parsons Marine Steam\r\nTurbine Co., Limited, of Wallsend-on-Tyne, and it was found that\r\nwhen the yacht was steaming at the rate of 15 knots per hour, the\r\nmachinery ran with an absence of vibration and noise.\r\n\r\nThe EMERALD is a vessel of 756 tons, yacht measurement, and was\r\nchartered by Mr. Geo. Gould, of New York, for six months from the\r\n15th April, 1903. Mr. Gould sent over to this country Captain Tod\r\nto navigate her across the Atlantic, with instructions to further\r\nexperiment on her steaming capabilities at sea, and to carefully\r\nobserve her behaviour compared with the other large steam yachts of\r\nwhich he has had charge. On the termination of the voyage, Captain\r\nTod reported that the yacht behaved splendidly; that there was no\r\nracing of propellers, and no vibration; and that the coal consumption\r\nwas moderate, considering the weather.\r\n\r\nThere have been several rumours to the effect that the new steamers\r\nfor the Cunard Mail Service are to be fitted with turbine engines,\r\nbut these rumours have not been officially confirmed. In any case\r\nthese steamers could not be completed in time to take from the\r\nAllan Line the distinction of being the first Company to own a\r\nTransatlantic Mail Turbine Steamship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir ALFRED L.

ELDER, DEMPSTER & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe firm of Elder, Dempster & Co. was founded in the year 1868 by\r\nMessrs. Alexander Elder and John Dempster, two gentlemen intimately\r\nacquainted with the working of the African Steamship trade. For 11\r\nyears they were the sole partners, but in 1879 they admitted Mr. (now\r\nSir Alfred) Jones into the firm, and Mr. W. J. Davey was also taken\r\ninto partnership. The original partners, Messrs. Elder and Dempster,\r\nretired from the firm in 1884. Mr. Alexander Sinclair, who became a\r\npartner in 1891, having retired in 1901, the sole partners at the\r\npresent date are Sir Alfred L. Jones, K.C.M.G., and Mr. W. J. Davey.\r\n\r\nThe firm is one of the largest commercial houses in the world, and\r\nin all the various branches of commerce in which it is interested\r\nit takes a foremost position. As steamship owners it controls the\r\nlargest fleet of steamers in Great Britain. The business of the firm\r\nextends so rapidly, and new steamers to meet the necessities of the\r\nseveral trades are so frequently being added to the fleet, that it\r\nis impossible to give a list of the vessels owned, or under the\r\nmanagement of the firm, which will not in a short time be obsolete,\r\nbut according to the official sailing list issued 28th March, 1903,\r\nthe following steamers were sailing under the triple flags of Messrs.\r\nElder, Dempster & Co.:—\r\n\r\n  ABEOKUTA.\r\n  ACCRA.\r\n  ADANSI.\r\n  AKABA.\r\n  AKASSA.\r\n  ALBERTVILLE.\r\n  ANCOBRA.\r\n  ANDONI.\r\n  ANVERSVILLE.\r\n  ANGOLA.\r\n  ASABA.\r\n  ASHANTI.\r\n  AXIM.\r\n  BAKANA.\r\n  BANANA.\r\n  BATHURST.\r\n  BATANGA.\r\n  BENGUELA.\r\n  BENIN.\r\n  BIAFRA.\r\n  BIDA.\r\n  BOMA.\r\n  BONNY.\r\n  BORNU.\r\n  BOULAMA.\r\n  BURUTU.\r\n  CABENDA.\r\n  CAMEROON.\r\n  COOMASSIE.\r\n  CONGO.\r\n  DAHOMEY.\r\n  DEGAMA.\r\n  DELTA.\r\n  DODO.\r\n  EGGA.\r\n  EGWANGA.\r\n  EKO.\r\n  EKURO.\r\n  ELMINA.\r\n  ETHIOPIA.\r\n  ETOLIA.\r\n  FANTEE.\r\n  FORCADOS.\r\n  HAUSSA.\r\n  IDDO.\r\n  ILARO.\r\n  ILORIN.\r\n  JEBBA.\r\n  KANO.\r\n  KWARRA.\r\n  LAGOON.\r\n  LAKE CHAMPLAIN.\r\n  LAKE ERIE.\r\n  LAKE MANITOBA.\r\n  LAKE MEGANTIC.\r\n  LAKE MICHIGAN.\r\n  LAKE ONTARIO.\r\n  LAKE SIMCOE.\r\n  LEON-Y-CASTILLIO.\r\n  LOANDA.\r\n  LOANGO.\r\n  LYCIA.\r\n  LLANDULAS.\r\n  MADEIRA.\r\n  MANDINGO.\r\n  MAYUMBA.\r\n  MELVILLE.\r\n  MEMNON.\r\n  MILWAUKEE.\r\n  MONMOUTH.\r\n  MONROVIA.\r\n  MONTAUK.\r\n  MONTEAGLE.\r\n  MONTEZUMA.\r\n  MONTREAL.\r\n  MONTROSE.\r\n  MONARCH.\r\n  MONTCALM.\r\n  MONTENEGRO.\r\n  MONTEREY.\r\n  MONTFORT.\r\n  MOUNT ROYAL.\r\n  MOUNT TEMPLE.\r\n  NIGERIA.\r\n  NYANGA.\r\n  OLENDA.\r\n  ORON.\r\n  PEREZ GALDOS.\r\n  PHILLIPEVILLE.\r\n  PORT ANTONIO.\r\n  PORT MARIA.\r\n  PORT MORANT.\r\n  PORT ROYAL.\r\n  PRAH.\r\n  ROQUELLE.\r\n  SANGARA.\r\n  SANSU.\r\n  SEKONDI.\r\n  SHERBRO.\r\n  SOBO.\r\n  TARQUAH.\r\n  TENERIFFE.\r\n  VIERA-Y-CLAVIJO.\r\n  VOLTA.\r\n  WARRI.\r\n  YOLA.\r\n  YORUBA.\r\n\r\nAs proving the difficulty of stating the number of steamships under\r\nthe control of this firm, and at the same time illustrating the\r\ngigantic nature of its commercial operations, it may be stated that\r\nwhile this volume was in preparation for the Press, it sold to the\r\nCanadian Pacific Railway Co. an entire fleet, consisting of fifteen\r\nlarge ocean liners. The despatch of the last Elder-Dempster liner\r\nunder the Beaver flag, on Wednesday, March 31st, 1903, was quite\r\nan historic event. She carried with her the first portion of the\r\nRev. J. M. Barr’s colony, numbering about 2,000 souls. Thousands\r\nof spectators lined the stage, and as the liner sheered away cheer\r\nafter cheer rent the air. Sir Alfred Jones, Mr. W. J. Davey, Mr.\r\nDavid Jones, the Revs. Canon Russell (Manchester), R. O. Greep,\r\nDr. Lightwood, S. Gasking and H. M. Braithwaite, as well as many\r\nwell-known personages in shipping and commerce, were present.\r\nThe band of the 1st Liverpool Volunteers played inspiring music,\r\nincluding tunes reminiscent of home and friendly associations, first\r\non the stage and afterwards on the ship.\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Jones expressed his regret, as he witnessed the multitude\r\non board the Lake Manitoba, that he had consented to sell his\r\nCanadian fleet to the Canadian Pacific Railway. He said his firm had\r\nworked hard to develop Canadian colonisation, and the full fruit of\r\ntheir efforts was only becoming visible now when they had left the\r\nbusiness. He commended the object of the expedition, and hoped for\r\nits success. A completely equipped colony of 2,000, with thousands\r\nmore to follow in due course, was, he considered, a novelty.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the three flags borne by the\r\nElder-Dempster steamers. The Beaver flag no longer exists. The other\r\ntwo are (1) the white swallow-tail flag with a red St. George’s cross\r\n(gold crown in centre) of the African Steamship Co.; and the blue\r\nswallow-tail flag, with a white St. George’s cross, of the British\r\nand African Steam Navigation Co. A brief sketch of the history of\r\nboth of these important companies, as well as of the Imperial Direct\r\nWest India Mail Service Limited, will be found in the succeeding\r\npages of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe management of any one of these fleets would be considered ample\r\nemployment for most mercantile firms, but they are only units in\r\nthe business conducted at that large hive of commerce, African\r\nHouse, Water Street, Liverpool, which is, by the way, shortly to be\r\ntransferred to Colonial Chambers, now in course of being erected. In\r\naddition to the services mentioned, Messrs. Elder, Dempster & Co.\r\nmaintain a service of Mail Steamers between Antwerp and the River\r\nCongo, under the title of the Compagnie Belge Maritime du Congo,\r\nan inter-insular Mail Service at the Canary Islands, and a Coastal\r\nService at Jamaica. They do also a large Ocean Tramp business, being\r\nprepared to carry cargo, when sufficient inducement offers, to and\r\nfrom any port in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is the existence of such splendidly managed mercantile fleets,\r\nsuch as the Elder-Dempster Line, that enabled Great Britain to\r\nastonish the world by the rapid and safe transport of troops and\r\nmunitions of war during the progress of the late War in South Africa.\r\nMany years of experience in the management of steamships have enabled\r\nthe company to design and construct a magnificent fleet of fast cargo\r\nliners, having lofty ’tween decks, and fitted with anti-rolling\r\nkeels, electric light and every modern improvement. Several of\r\nthese were chartered at an early stage of the war by the British\r\nAdmiralty, and retained for voyage after voyage as transports.\r\nNine steamers, of an aggregate gross tonnage of 52,000 tons, were\r\nrequisitioned in this way. In addition to these, the firm’s steamers\r\ncarried with remarkable success some 26,000 horses and 21,000 mules\r\nfrom New Orleans to the Cape, and some 5,000 horses and 3,000 mules\r\nfrom Canada, Hungary, the River Plate, &c. It may also be mentioned\r\nin this connection that the Elder-Dempster Liner MONTEREY conveyed\r\n“Strathcona’s Horse,” the MILWAUKEE the “Royal Canadians,” and the\r\nMONTFORT the Canadian contingent of Baden-Powell’s Police from\r\nHalifax, N.S., to the Cape. The MILWAUKEE was the transport selected\r\nto convey General Cronje, his family, and over 500 Boer prisoners\r\nto St. Helena. The Elder-Dempster transports had the good fortune\r\non several occasions to be able to render material assistance to\r\nother transports which had met with mishaps. Thus they came to the\r\nassistance of the CARINTHIA a few days after she stranded at Aux\r\nCayes, and, taking off her cargo of mules, carried them on to their\r\ndestination. The MONTROSE turned up just in the nick of time to save\r\nthe crew when the ill-fated MEXICAN foundered off the Cape, and when\r\nthe SUFFOLK stranded it was again an Elder-Dempster liner, the LAKE\r\nERIE, that came to her assistance, and did all that was possible to\r\nrescue the crew.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1902 Messrs. Elder, Dempster & Co. commenced running\r\nthe luxuriously appointed ocean liner LAKE SIMCOE on pleasure cruises\r\nto the Norwegian Fjords. Those persons who have had the pleasure\r\nof travelling by this vessel are most enthusiastic in their praise\r\nof the ship, her officers and her equipment, and of all who are\r\nresponsible for the comfort and enjoyment of the passengers. The LAKE\r\nSIMCOE is probably one of the largest pleasure steamers trading to\r\nthe Norwegian Coast, but her rates of passage money are by no means\r\ncommensurate with her size. It is an opportunity of visiting the Land\r\nof the Midnight Sun in comfort and even luxury which ought not to be\r\nmissed. The fact that a large proportion of the commanders, officers,\r\nengineers, seamen and firemen serving under the firm are Royal Naval\r\nReservists renders the Elder-Dempster fleet additionally valuable to\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steamship]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. JEBBA. African Steamship Co. Limited.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE AFRICAN STEAMSHIP COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years (1852) prior to the outbreak of the Crimean War, the\r\nAfrican Steamship Company was incorporated by Royal Charter with\r\nlimited liability. The initial capital was £250,000 in 12,500\r\nshares of £20 each. The first directors of the Company were—Sir\r\nJohn Campbell, K.C.H. (Chairman), James Hartley, Esq. (Director\r\nof the P. and O. Co.), John Black, Esq., Henry William Schneider,\r\nEsq., Macgregor Laird, Esq., Henry William Currie, Esq., William Law\r\nOgilby, Esq., and Charles William Gregory, Esq. Bankers, Messrs.\r\nCurrie & Co., Cornhill.\r\n\r\nThe prospectus of the company, as published in the “Times,” 13th\r\nJuly, 1852, was as follows:—\r\n\r\n“This Company is formed to carry out a contract with H.M. Government\r\nfor the monthly conveyance of the mails to Madeira, Teneriffe,\r\nand the principal ports and places on the West Coast of Africa,\r\nviz., Goree, Bathurst, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cape Coast Castle,\r\nAccra, Whydah, Badagny, Lagos, Bonny, Old Calabar, Cameroons and\r\nFernando Po; and to establish a line of steam communication between\r\nSierra Leone and the British West Indies as soon as satisfactory\r\narrangements are made with the Government.\r\n\r\n“The contract for the mails was taken by Mr. Macgregor Laird in\r\nDecember last, and is for a term of ten years from the 1st September\r\nnext. The annual payment by the Government commences at £23,250, and\r\ndiminishes at the rate of £500 yearly during the continuance of the\r\ncontract, making an average payment of £21,500 per annum.\r\n\r\n“Five iron screw steamships for this service are in the course of\r\nconstruction by Mr. John Laird, of Birkenhead, with engines by\r\nMessrs. George Forrester & Co., and Fawcett, Preston & Co., of\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\n“The first of these vessels is to be launched on the 3rd July, and\r\nwill be ready to commence the mail service in accordance with the\r\nterms of the contract on the 1st September. Two of them have capacity\r\nfor 700, two of them for 1,000, and one for 250 tons cargo, with\r\nexcellent accommodation for first-class passengers. The company are\r\nalso to have Mr. Laird’s services as Managing Director. A negotiation\r\nis going on with the Portuguese Government for an extension of the\r\nline from Fernando, the valuable African possession.\r\n\r\n“Plymouth will be the first port of arrival, and the last port of\r\ndeparture for the company’s vessels, but the voyage will terminate at\r\nand commence from London.”\r\n\r\nThe steamers referred to were the FORERUNNER, FAITH, HOPE, CHARITY,\r\nand NORTHERN LIGHTS.\r\n\r\nThe trading operations between London and Africa not being\r\nprofitable, the Board of Directors (about 1860) proposed to wind up\r\nthe company.\r\n\r\nOn the solicitations of Messrs. Fletcher & Parr, of Liverpool, they\r\nwere induced to try the trade from Liverpool to the West Coast of\r\nAfrica. The result of the trial was extremely satisfactory, and\r\nLiverpool became the home-port of the fleet. The business of the\r\ncompany increased rapidly, and the shareholders received their\r\ndividends for some time with gratifying regularity, but unfortunately\r\nabout ten years after the change from London to Liverpool, the\r\nrelations between the Board of Directors at the former port and the\r\nmanaging agents at Liverpool became somewhat strained.\r\n\r\nIn spite of a great financial loss, caused by the defalcations of the\r\nSecretary; of a small and inefficient fleet; and a policy on the part\r\nof the Directors which was decidedly peculiar, the company maintained\r\na struggling existence until 1891, when it passed into the management\r\nof the firm of “Elder, Dempster and Co.” Under the vigorous and\r\nsuccessful management of this firm, the African Steamship Company\r\nstarted on a new and prosperous career. Instead of, as in 1875,\r\npossessing a fleet of seven ocean steamers and two coast vessels,\r\nthe company now owns thirty-three modern, large and powerful ocean\r\nsteamers, ranging from 1,000 to 5,200 tons each, and six branch\r\nsteamers, four of which are 1,000 tons each.\r\n\r\nAn Express Service to the Coast has been established by means of a\r\nfleet of fast steamers of the JEBBA type, which reach Sekondi, the\r\ncentre of the new gold mining industry, in 15 days. They have been\r\nspecially constructed for the trade in which they are engaged, and\r\nno skill has been wanting nor expense spared to make them the most\r\nperfect of their kind. The passenger accommodation has received\r\nspecial attention. The saloons are spacious, the staterooms lofty and\r\nwell ventilated, while extensive promenade and bridge decks enable\r\npassengers to enjoy the invigorating sea breezes secure alike from\r\nsun and rain.\r\n\r\nThe company grants special facilities for visiting the beautiful\r\nislands of Madeira, Teneriffe and Grand Canary, issuing special\r\nholiday tickets, which include first-class passage out and home,\r\nand a fortnight’s board and accommodation at the Hotel Metropole,\r\nLas Palmas, for £15. Passengers have also the option of returning\r\n_via_ Barcelona or Genoa, by the steamers of “La Veloce Navigazione\r\nItaliana a Vapore” (The Italian Express Steam Navigation Co.).\r\n\r\nThe Royal Mail Steamers of the African Steamship Co., conjointly with\r\nthe steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Co., sail\r\nfrom Liverpool thrice a week for the Canary Islands and the West\r\nCoast, from Hamburg and Amsterdam weekly, and from Antwerp (Cie Belge\r\nMaritime du Congo) for Teneriffe, Sierra Leone and Congo Ports every\r\nthird week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailboat near rocky shore]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. TARQUAH. British & African Steam Navigation\r\nCo., Ltd.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH & AFRICAN STEAM NAVIGATION COMPANY, LIMITED (1900).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Company was projected in 1868 by a number of gentlemen\r\npractically acquainted with the trade of the West Coast of Africa.\r\nAmongst these were Mr. Alexander Elder and Mr. John Dempster who in\r\nthat year founded the firm of Elder, Dempster & Co., a firm whose\r\nramifications during these later years, under the guidance of Sir\r\nAlfred L. Jones, K.C.M.G., and Mr. Davey, may be said to extend\r\nthroughout the civilized world.\r\n\r\nThree steamers of about 1,300 tons gross each, were specially built\r\nto the order of the new company, by Messrs. Randolph Elder & Co.,\r\nof Glasgow, for the West African trade, and were named the BONNY,\r\nROQUELLE, and CONGO.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer steamer, the BONNY, sailed from Liverpool in January,\r\n1869, and thereafter a monthly service was maintained between\r\nGlasgow, Liverpool and the West Coast of Africa. After several years’\r\nemployment in this trade, the ROQUELLE was sold to Messrs. P. M.\r\nTintore & Co., Barcelona, and is still sailing from the Mersey under\r\nthe Spanish flag.\r\n\r\nSo successful were these steamers that in 1869 it was decided to add\r\nthree more to the fleet.\r\n\r\nThe new steamers were the LIBERIA, LOANDA and VOLTA, also specially\r\nbuilt for the trade by the late Mr. John Elder, the distinguished\r\nbrother of Mr. Alexander Elder, whose early death towards the end of\r\n1869 was so much deplored by the ship-building and engineering world.\r\nThe gross tonnage of these three vessels was increased to about 1,500\r\ntons each.\r\n\r\nIt was considered desirable during the same year to register the\r\nCompany as an Incorporated Company. The Registered Office of the\r\nCompany was in Glasgow, but Mr. Alexander Elder and Mr. John Dempster\r\nconducted its operations in Liverpool.\r\n\r\nWith the six steamers the Company now possessed the sailings were\r\nincreased to fortnightly.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the sailings from Glasgow were abandoned, cargo to and from\r\nthat port being transhipped at Liverpool.\r\n\r\nAs the trade expanded, additions were regularly made to the fleet,\r\nand in 1879 sailings between Hamburg and the West Coast of Africa\r\nwere commenced. In 1883 the Company was registered as a limited\r\ncompany, at which time its fleet had increased to 20 steamers and 2\r\nhulks with a gross registered tonnage of 30,753 tons.\r\n\r\nThe following year (1884) Mr. Elder and Mr. Dempster retired from\r\nthe firm of Elder, Dempster & Co., which since 1879 had consisted of\r\nthese gentlemen and Mr. (now Sir A. L.) Jones, and Mr. W. J. Davey.\r\nMessrs. Elder and Dempster, however, remained Managing Directors of\r\nthe Company until 1900, Mr. Elder having for some years previous to\r\nthis date occupied the position of Chairman.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 Messrs. Elder, Dempster & Co., purchased the entire business\r\nand assets of the British and African Steam Navigation Co., Limited,\r\nand with the addition of 9 large steamers, suitable for outside\r\ntrades, formed a new company with a share capital of £1,000,000,\r\nand Debenture Stock of £800,000. The new company has a fleet of 35\r\nsteamers with a total gross registered tonnage of 107,000 tons.\r\n\r\nWhile the bulk of its operations continue to be in connection with\r\nthe West Coast of Africa, several of its steamers are employed in the\r\nNorth Atlantic and other trades.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the first steamer, the BONNY, and the latest,\r\nthe BURUTU, built in 1902, will be seen by the following comparison\r\nof their respective dimensions:—\r\n\r\nBONNY, length 261·0 feet, beam 30·2 feet, depth 23 feet. Gross 1,326\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nBURUTU, length 360·0 feet, beam 44·2 feet, depth 26 feet. Gross 5,200\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nIn the later steamers of the fleet, the vessels of the BURUTU type,\r\ntraders and other travellers reach Sekondi, the centre of the new\r\ngold mining industry, in about 13 days from Liverpool. No skill\r\nhas been wanting nor expense spared to make these vessels the most\r\nperfect of their kind, and exactly suitable for tropical trade.\r\n\r\nA special feature of the steamers is the system of overhead trunk\r\nventilation, by which an imperceptible current of fresh air is kept\r\ncontinually circulating through the lofty and well lighted state\r\nrooms, making them cool and agreeable in the hottest weather.\r\n\r\nPassengers by the Royal Mail Steamers belonging to the British and\r\nAfrican Company, are granted special facilities for visiting the\r\nbeautiful islands of Madeira, Teneriffe and Grand Canary. The Company\r\nissues a special holiday ticket for £15, which includes Saloon\r\npassage out and home, and a fortnight’s board and accommodation at\r\nthe Hotel Metropole, Las Palmas. Passengers by these steamers who may\r\nwish to visit the Mediterranean, have also the option of returning\r\nfrom the islands via Barcelona or Genoa, by the steamers of the\r\nItalian Express Steam Navigation Co.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Mail Steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation\r\nCo., conjointly with the steamers of the African Steam Ship Co., sail\r\nfrom Liverpool three times a week for the Canary Islands and the West\r\nCoast of Africa, and from Hamburg and Rotterdam weekly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailboat in harbor]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. PORT ROYAL. Imperial Direct West India Mail\r\nService, Ltd.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL DIRECT WEST INDIA MAIL SERVICE, LIMITED.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor years the Island of Jamaica, the Pearl of the Antilles, had\r\nbeen decadent, its planters cast down and despairing because it was\r\nimpossible, owing to the heavily subsidized continental beet sugar,\r\nto grow cane sugar at a profit. And, although physicians in the\r\nUnited States were sending their patients to seek renewed health\r\nand energy “from the balmy breezes laden with health giving ozone\r\nwhich blow over the island,” British Life Insurance offices placed a\r\nblack mark against Jamaica, and demanded an additional premium from\r\ntheir policy holders for permission to visit its shores. But the\r\ndark commercial cloud is passing, and the island has entered upon an\r\nera of prosperity which bids fair to be greater and more permanent\r\nthan even the golden days of the sugar planter. It is an open secret\r\nthat for this the Jamaicans are indebted in great measure to the\r\nenterprise of Messrs. Elder, Dempster and Co., who have practically\r\ncreated the demand in Great Britain for Jamaica grown fruits, and who\r\nhave established a service of swift steamers, specially built for the\r\ntrade. This Line of steamers, which is known as the Imperial Direct\r\nWest India Mail Service although only established in the first year\r\nof the present century, has already achieved a remarkable success. In\r\naddition to bringing to England over 50,000 bunches of bananas per\r\nmonth, as well as other West Indian fruits, tobacco, coffee, sugar,\r\nrum, and other varieties of tropical produce, the steamers carry a\r\nlarge and increasing number of passengers each voyage between Great\r\nBritain and the colony.\r\n\r\nThe home port of the steamers is Avonmouth, near Bristol, from which\r\na fortnightly sailing is maintained throughout the year to Kingston\r\n(Jamaica), but it is probable that the service will soon be increased\r\nto a weekly one. In recognition of the invaluable services rendered\r\nby these steamers both to the Empire and to the colony, their\r\nRoyal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales paid a visit of\r\ninspection to the R.M.S. PORT ROYAL, at Avonmouth, on the 5th March,\r\n1902.\r\n\r\nThe vessels at present engaged in the direct Mail Service were all\r\nbuilt in 1901, and are named, the PORT ROYAL, PORT ANTONIO, PORT\r\nMORANT, and PORT MARIA. The first two steamers named are sister ships\r\nand are identical in measurement, viz., length 382 feet, beam 46\r\nfeet 6 inches, and depth 32 feet. Each is propelled by twin screws,\r\nand fitted with triple expansion engines capable of maintaining a\r\nspeed of 14 knots per hour, and carries about 5,000 tons cargo. They\r\ncan each accommodate 100 first-class passengers and 50 second-class\r\npassengers. The saloons and staterooms are handsomely decorated, and\r\nare fitted so as to secure a maximum of comfort for the passengers.\r\nThe cuisine and the appointments generally being those appertaining\r\nto a first-class mail and passenger steamer.\r\n\r\nA new mail steamer of considerably larger dimensions than any of the\r\npreceding steamers of the fleet, is now in course of construction and\r\nis expected to make her first voyage early in 1904. It is proposed to\r\ncall her the PORT KINGSTON.\r\n\r\nThese steamers sail from Avonmouth Dock, Bristol, every alternate\r\nSaturday, and make the voyage as a rule in from 12 to 14 days. The\r\nrates for passengers are:—Saloon (single) £18 to £25 pounds; (return)\r\n£32 to £40, according to the position of the stateroom, and number of\r\npersons occupying same. In the second saloon the charge is £14 for\r\nthe single passage, and £25 for the return.\r\n\r\nThe DELTA, belonging to the same Company, makes a trip round Jamaica\r\nevery week; she has first-class accommodation for passengers, and\r\naffords a splendid opportunity of seeing the coast and towns around\r\nthe Island. The charge for first-class passengers is £3 for the round\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nArrangements have been made with the Hamburg-American Line, running\r\nbetween Kingston (Jamaica) and Central American Ports, to carry\r\npassengers booked by Imperial Direct West India Line of Steamers to\r\nthe following Central American Ports, viz., Savanilla, Cartagena,\r\nPort Limon, and Greytown, at an inclusive first-class fare between\r\nKingston and any of the above Ports of £6 3s. per adult. Passengers\r\ntravelling on these tickets will be accommodated on special terms\r\nat the Myrtle Bank Hotel (Kingston), during the time between the\r\narrival of the Mail Steamers and the departure of the Steamer of the\r\nHamburg-American Line. There is also a good service from Kingston to\r\nCuba. The Cuba steamer leaves Kingston the day after the arrival of\r\nthe mail steamer from England.\r\n\r\nPassengers can also be booked through, via the Colon and Panama\r\nRailway, to the principal ports on the Chilian Coast. The steamers\r\nof the Pacific Mail Co. and Campania Sud-Americana Co. leave Panama\r\nweekly for the South, reaching Callao in about nine days and arriving\r\nat Valparaiso in about 21 days. Seeing that for years past the\r\nclimate of Jamaica has been libelled as unhealthy, it cannot be too\r\nstrongly affirmed, that from a medical point of view, the wonderful\r\nair of the hilly districts is unrivalled; it being in every way equal\r\nto that of the better known European winter resorts, to which it bids\r\nfair to become a serious rival.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailboats in harbor]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. ULSTER. City of Dublin Steampacket Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CITY OF DUBLIN STEAMPACKET COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the year 1822 Mr. C. W. Williams, of Dublin, crossed\r\nover to Liverpool with the object of inducing the merchants to\r\ntake shares in a line of steampackets he proposed building for the\r\nLiverpool and Dublin trade. Except to the most sanguine, the time\r\ndid not appear to be favourable for such a scheme. A large fleet\r\nof sailing smacks maintained daily communication (subject to the\r\nweather) between the two ports, carrying all kinds of goods, and even\r\ncattle. The steampackets WATERLOO and BELFAST sailed with passengers\r\nonly every alternate day from each side. Both these vessels had\r\nalready won for themselves a reputation, the former being the first\r\nsteampacket to ply regularly between England and Ireland, and the\r\nlatter having made a passage in the then remarkably short time of\r\n12½ hours. Besides this, “The Original Steampacket Company,” a new\r\ncompany (with powerful Government influence), including amongst its\r\nshareholders Lord Blaney, Major-General Preeth, Sir John Tobin, &c.,\r\nand trading under the title of the St. George Steampacket Company,\r\nhad in April preceding launched two of the largest and most powerful\r\nsteampackets that had yet been built, viz., the ST. PATRICK and the\r\nST. GEORGE. This latter vessel on the 13th September made a passage\r\nfrom Dublin in 11½ hours, thus making a record which she herself\r\nbroke on the 23rd April, 1824, by making a passage from Liverpool to\r\nDublin in 10 hours 40 minutes. In addition to the already established\r\nsteam and sailing lines, a third local steampacket company, supported\r\nby the traders, the “Dublin and Liverpool Steam Navigation Company,”\r\nwas in course of formation. It is not, therefore, surprising under\r\nthese circumstances that Mr. Williams, a stranger in Liverpool,\r\nfailed to obtain the financial support to his scheme which he\r\ndesired. It is the more to his credit that, though disappointed in\r\nLiverpool, he persevered with his project in Dublin with so much\r\nsuccess that he was enabled to return to Liverpool in February of the\r\nfollowing year (1823) and place an order with “Frigate” Wilson for\r\nthe pioneer steamer of the future famous City of Dublin Steampacket\r\nCompany, the CITY OF DUBLIN, a vessel of 130 h.p. It was an express\r\nstipulation with the builder that this steamer should be constructed\r\nof such materials and in such a manner as to withstand the severity\r\nof the winter navigation. The CITY OF DUBLIN differed from her\r\ncompetitors in two respects—(1) in carrying general cargo in addition\r\nto live stock and passengers, and (2) in maintaining the service\r\nuninterruptedly throughout the twelve months.\r\n\r\nA month later Mr. Wilson was again applied to to build a second\r\nvessel for the company, but in consequence of his having that very\r\nmorning (5th March) contracted to build the HY. BELL for the Glasgow\r\ntrade, it was not till some days later the contract was made for the\r\nbuilding of the TOWN OF LIVERPOOL, to be commenced as soon as the HY.\r\nBELL was launched.\r\n\r\nThe CITY OF DUBLIN made her maiden voyage on Saturday, the 20th\r\nMarch, 1824, and Mr. Samuel Perry, of 16, Water Street, was appointed\r\nagent to the company. She anticipated by about six months the\r\noperations of the traders’ company (the Dublin and Liverpool Steam\r\nNavigation), whose first steamer, the LIFFEY, 305 tons burden, and\r\n110 h.p., did not sail until the 13th September following. From the\r\noutset the managers of the City of Dublin Company seemingly did not\r\nregard the Original Steampacket Company as formidable opponents,\r\nbut they determined either to vanquish or acquire the other two\r\ncompanies, the greater of which was the St. George Steampacket\r\nCompany. The second company was well supported by the Liverpool\r\nmerchants, and kept its sailings (with goods and passengers)\r\nthroughout the year. In December of the same year (1824) the MERSEY\r\njoined the LIFFEY, and in the July following the COMMERCE, one\r\nof the largest steampackets (up to that date) built in this port,\r\nwas added to the fleet. This company’s packets proceeded direct\r\nto Dublin, and discharged at Custom House Quay. On Saturday, 5th\r\nFebruary, 1825, the third vessel belonging to the City of Dublin\r\nSteampacket Company was launched from the yard of Dawson and Pearson,\r\nSouth Shore, and on the 22nd April succeeding the managers issued the\r\nfollowing public notice:—\r\n\r\n“The City of Dublin Steampacket Company announce to the public that\r\nin consequence of the many complaints hitherto made of want of\r\nstorage room in Dublin for goods going and coming by their steam\r\nvessels, they have taken the lot of ground immediately opposite\r\nthe Packet Station on the North Wall, and are about to erect a\r\nconvenient and commodious store on the same for the accommodation\r\nof the merchants and traders of Dublin. The Company have increased\r\ntheir capital to £100,000, and are proceeding with every possible\r\nexpedition in completing their number of vessels, by which means\r\nthey will shortly be able to despatch one daily from Dublin and\r\nanother from Liverpool. The trustees have reserved the remainder of\r\nthe shares now unappropriated exclusively for the accommodation of\r\nshippers and importers. Their vessels, the CITY OF DUBLIN and TOWN OF\r\nLIVERPOOL, continue to ply as usual. Their third and fourth vessels,\r\nthe HIBERNIA and BRITANNIA, are nearly complete, and the fifth and\r\nsixth will be ready by the end of the year.”\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1825 the City of Dublin Company despatched\r\ntheir new steamer HIBERNIA on the same day and at the same hour\r\nas the ST. GEORGE. They were careful to inform those interested\r\nthat this was done “not with a view of opposition, but for the\r\npurpose of establishing her (the HIBERNIA’s) character for speed\r\nand seaworthiness.” They were equally careful to point out that\r\n“the HIBERNIA has already made six voyages in company with the ST.\r\nGEORGE, and has on all occasions proved herself an extremely safe\r\nand fleet vessel, and not inferior to that well-known steampacket.”\r\nThey also mentioned the inconvenience, delay and expense of landing\r\nby boats at Kingstown, all of which might be avoided by taking their\r\nmagnificent steampackets direct to North Wall.\r\n\r\nThe St. George Company replied to this courteous announcement by\r\nalso informing the public that the companionship of the HIBERNIA\r\nwas unsought for and undesired by them. It was not to be expected\r\nthat the Liverpool companies would permit a strange company to take\r\na lion’s share of the trade, and not make a practical protest.\r\nConsequently, in the autumn of 1825, the fares from Liverpool to\r\nDublin were reduced to 5s. cabin and 6d. steerage, and on Monday,\r\nSeptember 5th, one of the steamers sailed with upwards of 700\r\npassengers at 6d. each. Early the following year (1st February, 1826)\r\nthe managers of the City of Dublin Steampacket Company purchased\r\nthe Dublin and Liverpool Steam Navigation Company, and increased\r\nthe capital of the company to £250,000, in shares of £100 each.\r\nShareholders, in addition to their share of the profits of the\r\nundertaking, were offered the following advantages:—\r\n\r\n(1) Free passage by all the company’s vessels.\r\n\r\n(2) Free storage for a limited time in the company’s stores.\r\n\r\n(3) Special accommodation in the payment of freights and charges.\r\n\r\nThe company having grown with a rapidity probably without a parallel,\r\ndecided to extend its sailings to Belfast and Waterford, and, if\r\ndesirable, to other ports. It had now a fleet (afloat or building)\r\nof fourteen new and powerful steamers, viz., CITY OF DUBLIN, TOWN\r\nOF LIVERPOOL, HIBERNIA, BRITANNIA, LIFFEY, MERSEY, COMMERCE, MONA,\r\nLEEDS, GIPSEY, MANCHESTER, BIRMINGHAM, SHEFFIELD and NOTTINGHAM. On\r\nthe 29th August, 1826, the Government established a mail service\r\nbetween Liverpool and Kingstown, with most injurious results to the\r\nexisting steampacket companies. The managers of the City of Dublin\r\nCompany interviewed the Secretary to the General Post Office in order\r\nto obtain some modification of the opposition, but without being able\r\nto do so. They thereupon published the result of their negotiations,\r\nand appealed to the public for support against the unjustifiable\r\naction shown by the Government. “The Post Office having now\r\nestablished packets on the station, have, with a view of covering the\r\nheavy expenses incident to the same, endeavoured to engross the trade\r\nin passengers, carriages, horses, &c., to the great injury of this\r\nand other companies; while at the same time they are exempt from the\r\npayment of port dues and other charges ... which are already a tax\r\non this company to the amount of £10,000 per annum. Under terms so\r\nunequal and disadvantageous, it is evident this opposition has none\r\nof the ingredients of fair opposition, were such even justifiable,\r\nwhere Government on the one hand, and private shipowners on the\r\nother, are the competitors.”\r\n\r\nAt this period (1827) there was considerable friction between the\r\nMersey Dock Board and the company, the managers of the latter\r\nconsidering greater facilities ought to be given for the working\r\nof their traffic in view of the fact that they annually spent in\r\nLiverpool £100,000 in outfits and repairs. To meet the Government\r\nopposition the company purchased the sailing brig TYNE, which they\r\nloaded fortnightly with rough goods, and towed to sea by their own\r\ntug MARS. In 1828, in addition to their daily service to Dublin,\r\nthe company had a twice-weekly service to Belfast, and once a week\r\nto Drogheda. A fortnightly service between Dublin and Bordeaux was\r\ncommenced on the 20th June, 1827. The BALLINASLOE, built in 1829,\r\nwas furnished with a powerful blast cylinder to ventilate the holds,\r\nbeing the first steamer to be so fitted. The same year the MANCHESTER\r\nand the BRITANNIA were both wrecked, but fortunately without loss of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe steampacket CITY OF LONDONDERRY, built in 1827 for a local\r\ncompany, was sold by auction on the 8th October, 1829, and purchased\r\nby the City of Dublin Company. Her new owners took up the station\r\nvacated by the Derry Company, and maintained a weekly service between\r\nLiverpool and Londonderry for a number of years. The Clarence Dock\r\nhaving been opened in September, 1830, the City of Dublin Company\r\nwere allotted loading and discharging berths in it on the 25th March,\r\n1831, which berths they have used continuously to the present date\r\n(1903), a period of over seventy years, when they were transferred to\r\nthe Nelson Dock.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in the early history of the company their\r\nmost powerful trade competitors were the St. George Steampacket\r\nCompany. One of the steamers of the latter company (the LORD BLANEY),\r\nwhile on a voyage from Liverpool to Newry, was lost with all hands.\r\nWith a chivalry unusual in commerce (ignoring the fact that the\r\nvessel belonged to a rival company) the City of Dublin Company headed\r\na list for the benefit of the relatives of the drowned seamen and\r\nothers with a subscription of one hundred pounds. Civil war had been\r\nraging in Portugal for a number of years, the leaders being Don\r\nMiguel (the usurper) and Dom Pedro, on behalf of his daughter, Donna\r\nMaria (Legitimist). Two at least of the company’s steamers, the LEEDS\r\nand BIRMINGHAM, were chartered as transports to Dom Pedro; and it\r\nwas the latter vessel, under the command of Captain Beazley, which,\r\non the 16th July, 1833, brought to England the news of the complete\r\ndefeat and capture of the fleet of Don Miguel. On the 6th November,\r\n1834, the LEEDS struck on Furlong Rock. No lives were lost, the crew\r\nand passengers being taken off by the company’s steamer COMMERCE. The\r\nLEEDS having got off the rock, sank inside the jetty at Holyhead, but\r\nwas subsequently raised.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 the company built four steamers to compete against the\r\nGovernment mail steamers. They were the QUEEN VICTORIA, DUCHESS OF\r\nKENT, ROYAL ADELAIDE, and the famous ROYAL WILLIAM. In June of this\r\nyear (1836) a bill in Parliament for increasing the capital of the\r\ncompany was read three times and passed.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the directors of the company had under consideration\r\nthe establishing of steam communication between Liverpool and New\r\nYork. A meeting was held in the company’s office in Water Street,\r\nthere being present, amongst others, Sir John Tobin. Sir John had on\r\nthe stocks a large steamer, and it was decided that the Transatlantic\r\nservice should be established, the pioneer vessel to be the ROYAL\r\nWILLIAM, to be followed by the LIVERPOOL (Sir John Tobin’s new\r\nsteamer) as soon as she was ready for the service. In accordance\r\nwith these arrangements, the ROYAL WILLIAM sailed from the George’s\r\nPierhead on July 5th, 1838, for New York, and the LIVERPOOL followed\r\nher on September 20th. These steamers have the honour of being the\r\nfirst passenger liners between Liverpool and New York. The ROYAL\r\nWILLIAM proved to be too small for the Transatlantic trade, and in\r\n1839 she resumed her sailings on the Liverpool and Kingstown station.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROYAL WILLIAM P. S. (1836) City of Dublin Steampacket\r\nCo.]\r\n\r\nOn and from the 20th June, 1839, the Government determined that\r\na mail steamer should be despatched every morning and evening\r\nfrom Liverpool to Dublin, _via_ Kingstown, on the arrival of the\r\nrespective mail trains from London. The Government steam packets were\r\nappointed to sail with the morning mails, and the City of Dublin\r\nsteam packets with the evening mails. The directors of the City of\r\nDublin Company were determined that their steamers should surpass the\r\nGovernment boats, and in December, 1840, they contracted for two new\r\nsteamers for the mail service to be superior to any seagoing steamers\r\nafloat, and to do the passage from Liverpool to Kingstown in nine\r\nhours. Three years later (15th April, 1843) the company commenced\r\ntheir Liverpool and North Wales service with the new iron steamer\r\nERIN-GO-BRAGH. The steamer AYRSHIRE LASSIE was placed on the station\r\nthe next season (May, 1844), followed in 1845 by the PRINCE OF WALES,\r\nand later by the PRINCE ARTHUR, which two steamers maintained a\r\ndaily service throughout the summer season for many years, and until\r\nthe station was transferred to the present North Wales Steampacket\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the North Lancashire Railways, the City of Dublin\r\nCompany instituted, in 1844, a steamship service between Dublin\r\nand Fleetwood, the first steamer employed being the HIBERNIA. The\r\nCompany’s trade between England and Ireland had increased so rapidly\r\nthat in 1845 the directors placed orders to build eight vessels,\r\nviz., five paddle steamers and three auxiliary screw schooners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Holyhead and Kingstown Royal Mail Steamships—ULSTER,\r\nMUNSTER, LEINSTER, and CONNAUGHT.]\r\n\r\nThe long contest between the Admiralty and the company for the\r\ncarriage of the English and Irish mails came to an end in 1850,\r\nwhen the Lords of the Admiralty determined to withdraw their\r\nsteamers from the Irish mail service. The City of Dublin Co. had now\r\na new competitor in the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company, who\r\nhad steamers in connection with their railway service. The former\r\ncompany, who recognised the great importance of placing vessels on\r\nthe Holyhead station, put in a tender in response to the Admiralty’s\r\ninvitation, which tender was actually accepted. No tender was put in\r\nby the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company, who, it was believed,\r\ndid not suppose anyone would compete with them and that they could\r\nobtain their own terms. Before the Admiralty’s acceptance of the\r\nCity of Dublin Company’s tender was confirmed by the Government the\r\nrailway company got notice of what was being arranged, and pressure\r\nwas brought to bear upon the Government to prevent the City of Dublin\r\nCompany’s contract from being ratified. The move was successful, with\r\nthe result that tenders were again asked for. The City of Dublin\r\nCompany were most unfairly treated, for the figure at which they had\r\ntendered was made public, and consequently the railway company were\r\nable to under-cut it. In anticipation of this course being adopted\r\nthe managing director of the City of Dublin Company recommended a\r\ntender to be put in at a very diminished figure, the great importance\r\nof securing a footing on the Holyhead station being fully perceived\r\nby him. The City of Dublin tendered at £25,000 per annum, which was\r\n£5,000 a year less than the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company’s\r\noffer, and the result was that the City of Dublin Company obtained\r\nthe contract. They purchased from the Admiralty two of the mail\r\nboats, the ST. COLUMBA and the LLEWELLYN, and in May, 1850, took over\r\nthe mail service, running the steamers at the same hours as they\r\nwere run by the Admiralty. A strong effort was made by the opponents\r\nof the company to deprive them of their contract, and a select\r\nParliamentary Committee was appointed, which reported in favour of\r\nwhat had been arranged. This report made it clear that the company’s\r\nfirst offer was a reasonable one, and subsequent events proved the\r\nwisdom of the company’s directors determining to hold the contract at\r\nall hazards. The contest, it will be seen, was between the City of\r\nDublin Company and the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company rather\r\nthan with the Lords of the Admiralty—indeed, so strong was the\r\nfeeling some time afterwards that the railway company refused to book\r\npassengers by the mail steamers, or advertise their sailings in the\r\nrailway time tables, which only showed the sailings of the railway\r\ncompany’s steamers.\r\n\r\nBut if the City of Dublin Company was thus happily relieved from\r\nrivalry on the Holyhead mail station, it speedily found itself\r\ninvolved in the most serious struggle which probably ever occurred\r\nin the steamship coasting trade. Yielding to the solicitations of\r\nthe Waterford and Kilkenny Railway Company, the directors of the\r\nCity of Dublin Company agreed to place a steamer on the Liverpool\r\nand Waterford station. The Waterford Company and the Cork Company\r\nimmediately began a daily service to and from Liverpool and Dublin,\r\nand despatched a steamer twice a week to Belfast. Entering into an\r\nalliance with the British and Irish Steampacket Co., the City of\r\nDublin Company and its ally responded by opposing the Cork Company\r\non the Liverpool and Cork station, sailing the DUCHESS OF KENT,\r\nEMERALD, ROSE, &c., every Tuesday and Friday from Liverpool and from\r\nCork. After a keen contest, lasting over twelve months, a conference\r\ntook place between Mr. Malcomson, representing the Waterford and\r\nCork Steamship Companies, and one of the directors of the City of\r\nDublin Company. No reference was made at this conference as to the\r\ncause of the contest, nor to the conduct of any of the parties during\r\nits continuance, the sole object being to suggest the most speedy\r\nmode of restoring peace, and the following arrangement was finally\r\ndecided upon:—The City of Dublin Steampacket Company agreed to sell\r\ntheir claims on the London line to the British and Irish Steampacket\r\nCompany, this line to be worked by the vessels of the latter company\r\nand of Messrs. Malcomson; the City of Dublin to transfer their\r\nLiverpool and Belfast service to the Cork Steamship Company; the\r\nentire sea traffic between Holyhead and Dublin to be assigned to the\r\nCity of Dublin Company. This agreement has been honourably adhered to\r\nby all the companies concerned, amongst whom a most friendly feeling\r\nexists, but time has wrought its changes on the various lines.\r\nMalcomson’s steamers have long since ceased to run between Dublin\r\nand London, the Cork Company’s steamers were withdrawn in 1854 from\r\nthe Liverpool and Belfast service, and the London and North Western\r\nRailway Company have a large fleet of passenger and cargo steamers\r\nplying daily between Dublin and Holyhead.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1854 a better feeling prevailed, and the\r\nChester and Holyhead Railway Company, together with the London and\r\nNorth Western Railway Company, entered into negotiations with the\r\nCity of Dublin Company, and, with the approval of the Government, an\r\nAct of Parliament was obtained in order to bring about an improved\r\npassenger and mail service between London and Dublin, via Holyhead\r\nand Kingstown. Considerable delay took place in the subsequent\r\nnegotiations. However, at the end of 1858 matters were settled, and\r\nin January of the following year the Postmaster-General entered into\r\na contract with the two railway companies and the City of Dublin\r\nSteampacket Company, who jointly undertook the sea service, and with\r\nthe two railway companies, who undertook the land transit. By private\r\nagreement, however, with the railway companies, the City of Dublin\r\nCompany became solely responsible for the sea service, and provided\r\nthe four steamers. This service gave the greatest satisfaction to\r\nthe travelling public; the contract was for fourteen years certain,\r\nand then from year to year, terminable by twelve months’ notice, the\r\nsubsidy being £85,900 per annum for the sea service, and £50,000 per\r\nannum for the land.\r\n\r\nTwelve years after this service had been commenced, the London and\r\nNorth Western Railway Company, who had by that time absorbed the\r\nChester and Holyhead Railway, commenced a rail connection between\r\nthe harbour of Dublin and three of the principal Irish railway\r\ncompanies, which connection was completed in 1876, and the London and\r\nNorth Western Company began to run a service of steamers in direct\r\nopposition to the mail route. Under the terms of their agreement\r\nwith the City of Dublin Company, the railway company had the power\r\nof fixing the fares by the mail route, which it exercised by\r\nmaintaining the high fares by the mail and charging low fares by the\r\nrailway steamers. The competition increased in intensity every year,\r\nwith the result of largely diverting the passenger traffic from the\r\nmail route, the ultimate object of the railway being to bring about\r\nthe abandonment of the Kingstown service, and to secure all the\r\ntraffic for the railway boats to Dublin. In 1881 the City of Dublin\r\nCompany brought the London and North Western Railway Company before\r\nthe Railway Commissioners, who ordered a reduction of the mail fares.\r\nImmediately after this order was made, the Post Office authorities\r\nintimated their intention of terminating the existing mail contract,\r\nand of asking for fresh tenders for the service between Holyhead\r\nand Kingstown. In 1882 the City of Dublin Company put in a tender.\r\nMonths were allowed to pass, and in January, 1883, it was announced\r\nthat the Government had accepted a tender of the London and North\r\nWestern Railway Company. It then transpired that the railway company,\r\nas well as the City of Dublin Company, had tendered for the Holyhead\r\nand Kingstown service, and that the latter company’s tender was the\r\nlower of the two, but the Government, instead of accepting it, had\r\nnegotiated a contract for the throughout service with the railway\r\ncompany, which would have enabled them to convey the mails and\r\npassengers in the railway steamers to Dublin instead of to Kingstown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM WATSON, Esq. (late Chairman City of Dublin\r\nSteampacket Co.).]\r\n\r\nIt can well be understood that the public, who were well pleased to\r\nhave the two lines of steamers, had no intention of being deprived\r\nof the Kingstown route, and a storm of indignation arose over the\r\ncountry. The Government professed that in making the new arrangement\r\nthey were acting with economy, but this was shown to be a mere\r\nsubterfuge, for they had agreed to pay the railway company £106,000\r\na year—only a trifling amount less than they would have paid if the\r\nsteampacket company’s offer had been accepted and the railway payment\r\ncontinued as before. To quote the words of a prominent member of\r\nParliament: “The Government were giving an opulent railway company\r\nnot only a monopoly of the passenger traffic, but a large subsidy\r\nbesides, for merely carrying the mail bags on their established\r\nline of passenger steamers.” So powerful was the agitation that\r\narose, that the Government discovered they would not be able to get\r\nthe contract confirmed by the House of Commons, the Irish members\r\nto a man being determined to vote against it. The result was the\r\ncontract was not brought forward for confirmation, and new tenders\r\nwere asked for the Holyhead and Kingstown sea service, special\r\nprovision being made for the passenger traffic, which the Government\r\nhad ignored on the previous occasion. Greater speed being desired,\r\nthe City of Dublin Company tendered for improved steamers; but the\r\nrailway company, who had no intention of going to Kingstown, did not\r\ncompete, and the City of Dublin Company were successful in obtaining\r\na contract for twelve years certain, the subsidy being £84,000 per\r\nannum. The four mail packets—the ULSTER, LEINSTER, MUNSTER, and\r\nCONNAUGHT—were provided with new boilers and improved machinery, and\r\ntheir passenger accommodation was remodelled and greatly enlarged.\r\n\r\nThe new service began on the 1st October, 1885, with this most\r\nremarkable result, that vessels after twenty-five years’ service\r\nhad their speed increased by an average of 2½ knots per hour. A\r\nnew steamer was added to the fleet—the IRELAND, a vessel capable\r\nof steaming 20 knots an hour, being the fastest paddle steamer\r\never built for cross-Channel service. The new service gave much\r\nsatisfaction to the public, and the passenger receipts steadily\r\nincreased. In 1893 the company decided to build a new type of\r\npassenger and cargo vessel, and in the following year the LOUTH,\r\na screw steamer of large tonnage and great power, was put on the\r\nstation; she was found so satisfactory, her performance being so\r\nregular, and her sea-worthy qualities so good, that she dispelled\r\nthe great prejudice which up to that time had existed against screw\r\nsteamers for cross-Channel trade (especially the cattle trade), and\r\nthe company decided to replace their fleet with steamers of this\r\nclass. While this re-construction was going on an attempt was made\r\nto deprive the company of their position on the Holyhead station.\r\nOwing largely to the efforts of the company, Kingstown had been put\r\nin direct communication with all the Irish railway companies, and the\r\none blot on the Kingstown service removed. It was stated, however,\r\nthat the boats were not fast enough, and the Government were urged to\r\nterminate the mail contract and seek for new tenders.\r\n\r\nMost extravagant ideas seemed to prevail as to what could be done;\r\naccelerations were suggested by land and sea which could not have\r\nbeen accomplished except at very great expense. However, the City\r\nof Dublin Company were not behindhand, and they put in a variety of\r\ntenders, and offered to build boats of the very largest class. No\r\nother company tendered in accordance with the advertisement. The Post\r\nOffice, however, did not accept any of the tenders, and subsequently\r\nentered into negotiations with the company, and settled the\r\nexisting contract. The company undertook to build four twin-screw\r\nsteamers, which, although not so large as those originally proposed,\r\nare superior to anything up to the present time attempted for\r\ncross-Channel purposes, and being twin-screws, their accommodation is\r\nfar greater than had they been paddle steamers of the same size. They\r\nall realised a speed of 24 knots on their trial trips, which up to\r\nthe present time has not been surpassed by any passenger steamer.\r\n\r\nThe new service commenced on the 1st April, 1897, and passengers are\r\nconveyed between all parts of England and Ireland at a very high rate\r\nof speed, and perform the journey with a degree of comfort that would\r\nhave been thought incredible a few years since.\r\n\r\nThe fleet of the company now consists of the following high-class\r\npowerful screw steamers, replete with everything necessary for the\r\ncomfort of passengers, as well as being equipped with the most\r\nmodern appliances for the safe carriage of cattle and the rapid\r\nhandling of cargo:—The ULSTER, MUNSTER, LEINSTER, and CONNAUGHT,\r\nsailing twice each day from Holyhead and from Kingstown with the\r\nmails and passengers. The CARLOW, KERRY, WICKLOW, LOUTH, and CORK,\r\nsailing every evening to and from Liverpool and Dublin, with goods\r\nand passengers, as well as a morning service from both ports, with\r\npassengers and fast traffic. In the present year (1903) the Company\r\nhas placed the KILKENNY on the station, a vessel of an entirely new\r\ndesign, one of the finest passenger and cargo steamers which has\r\never been built for the Irish cross-Channel trade. A service is also\r\nmaintained three times a week between Dublin and Belfast by the\r\ncompany’s steamers.\r\n\r\nFor upwards of three-quarters of a century this grand old company has\r\nfaithfully served the public, with an immunity from loss of life as\r\nremarkable as it is gratifying to those chiefly concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH AND IRISH STEAM PACKET COMPANY, LIMITED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oldest deep-sea steamship passenger trade in Europe is that\r\nbetween Dublin and London. The distinction of having been the first\r\npersons (other than the crew) to cross the Irish Sea by steam\r\nvessel is shared by Mr. and Mrs. C. R. Weld. Mr. Weld, who was the\r\nSecretary—or brother to the Secretary—of the Royal Society of Dublin,\r\nembarked with his wife on board the steampacket THAMES, Captain Dodd,\r\nwhich vessel sailed from Dublin at noon on the 28th May, 1815, bound\r\nfor London.\r\n\r\nThe sailing of this, the first, steamer between Dublin and London,\r\nwas an event of the greatest interest to the citizens of the former\r\ncity, who assembled in thousands to witness her departure. It was not\r\nintended that the THAMES should ply between the two ports, and, as a\r\nmatter of fact, it was not until after an interval of eleven years\r\n(1826) that a regular steampacket service was established between the\r\nMetropolis of England and that of Ireland. In the latter year, two of\r\nthe City of Dublin Steam Packet Co.’s steamers, the THAMES (not the\r\nTHAMES of 1815) and the SHANNON commenced to trade regularly between\r\nDublin and London.\r\n\r\nAmongst other famous steamers, employed on this station, may be\r\nmentioned the WILLIAM FAWCETT, which traded between London and\r\nDublin during the summer of 1829. This steamer afterwards became\r\nthe property of the Peninsular Steam Navigation Co., and is stated\r\nin Whitaker’s Almanac (and elsewhere) to have been the pioneer\r\nsteamer of the “P. & O. Co.” In August, 1830, the steampacket CITY OF\r\nLONDONDERRY, built in 1827 for the Liverpool and Londonderry trade,\r\nand purchased in October, 1829, by the City of Dublin Co., was\r\nplaced by her new owners on the London station. These three steamers,\r\nthe THAMES, SHANNON and CITY OF LONDONDERRY, were described in the\r\nCompany’s advertisement of the period as being amongst the largest\r\nsteamers afloat, and all of the same capacity and power, viz., 513\r\ntons burthen, and 160 h.p. each. These steamers maintained a regular\r\nweekly service (one of them sailing from London every Sunday, calling\r\nat Plymouth), and were due at Dublin in ordinary weather, in 80 hours\r\nafter leaving London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY ROBERTS. 1464 Tons. Speed 13 Knots.]\r\n\r\nTravelling at that period was expensive, as shown by the rates\r\ncharged by these small wooden steamers, compared with those now\r\ncharged by the magnificent modern steamships of the B. and I. Co. of\r\n1,400 to 1,500 tons each.\r\n\r\n                                                       Cabin.  Steerage.\r\n  THAMES, SHANNON, &c.               2 16 0   1 14 0\r\n  LADY ROBERTS, LADY WOLSELEY, &c.   1  5 0   0 11 0\r\n\r\nThe present British and Irish Steampacket Company was established\r\nin 1836. The list of the earliest Directors contained the names of\r\nseveral of the best known citizens of Dublin, the following being\r\nthe names of the Directors for the year 1838, viz.:—Messrs. James\r\nFerrier, John MacDonnell, William Williams, Francis Carleton, Joseph\r\nBoyce, John Jameson, and John Ennis. The Company’s first fleet\r\nconsisted of three wooden paddle steamers, named respectively, CITY\r\nOF LIMERICK, DEVONSHIRE, and SHANNON.\r\n\r\nA very ingenious robbery from the Company took place at the St.\r\nKatherine’s Docks. Two boxes of gold dust, of a gross value of\r\n£5,245, were landed at Falmouth, ex H.M. Packet SEAGULL, from the\r\nBrazils. From Falmouth they were shipped per B. and I. steamer\r\nCITY OF LIMERICK to the Company’s Wharf, London, consigned to the\r\nBrazilian Mining Co. At noon on Monday, 29th April, 1839, a person\r\nclaimed the two boxes, and presented an order for them, apparently in\r\nthe same handwriting as the letter of advice received with the two\r\nboxes from Falmouth. The advice stated that the boxes were only to be\r\ndelivered to a gentleman who would call on Monday with a letter in\r\nthe same handwriting. The “gentleman” accurately described the marks,\r\nand took away the boxes; but two hours afterwards, another person,\r\nconnected with the Brazilian Mining Co., came for the boxes, and\r\nthe fraud was then discovered, for the genuine documents and letter\r\naddressed to the Company by the Falmouth Agent were produced.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, the whole of the criminals concerned were in\r\ncustody, and charged with their offence at the Central Criminal\r\nCourt. Two of them, Moss and Solomons, turned Queen’s evidence. Lewin\r\nCaspar (who had been for eighteen months in the service of the B.\r\nand I. Co. as General Superintendent), was detained in custody until\r\nsentence was pronounced, 3rd February, 1840, and was then acquitted,\r\nowing to a flaw in the indictment. His father, Ellis Caspar, and\r\nEmmanuel Moses, were each sentenced to be transported for 14 years,\r\nand sailed for Sydney on the 20th October, 1840, on the convict\r\ntransport, LORD LYNEDOCH. Alice Abrahams (daughter of Emmanuel Moses)\r\nwas also convicted of being an accomplice, and was sentenced to\r\nfour months’ imprisonment. Mr. James Hartley (founder of the firm\r\nof James Hartley & Co., London) rendered very valuable service to\r\nthe proprietors by his energy and skill in tracing and successfully\r\nprosecuting the thieves. Mr. James Hartley was elected a Director in\r\n1838, and for his services in connection with the prosecution of the\r\ngold dust thieves, he was presented with a valuable piece of plate.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, the steamship DUKE OF CORNWALL was built, and added to the\r\nfleet in order to meet the increased demands of the trade. Like her\r\nsister ships, she was a wooden paddle steamer, and the last of this\r\ntype of craft employed in the service.\r\n\r\nThe British and Irish Steam Packet Co. were amongst the first\r\nsteamship owners to recognise the advantage (now universally\r\nadmitted) of the screw propeller over the paddle wheel as a means for\r\npropelling steamships, and in 1845 they introduced into the London\r\nand Dublin trade two schooner-rigged auxiliary screw steamers, one\r\nof which was called the ROSE, and the other the SHAMROCK. Three\r\nyears later the B. and I. Co. had to encounter a fierce and powerful\r\nopposition, engineered by the Messrs. Malcomson, of Waterford, but\r\nwhich involved nearly all the leading Steamship Companies on the\r\nEast Coast of Ireland; the B. and I.; Belfast (Langtry’s); City of\r\nDublin; Cork; and Waterford Steamship Companies all taking part in\r\nthe contest. The Waterford Steamship Company placed steamers on the\r\nLondon and Dublin station, and the Directors of the British and Irish\r\nSteam Packet Company retaliated by placing steamers on the Waterford\r\nand London, Waterford and Liverpool, and London and St. Petersburg\r\nlines. The opposition lasted until April, 1851, when an arrangement\r\nwas come to, whereby the Dublin and London traffic was divided\r\nbetween Messrs. Malcomson (Waterford Co.) and the B. and I., and at\r\nthe same time the City of Dublin Co. withdrew from their official\r\nconnection with the latter Company. In the meantime, several steamers\r\nhad been built of iron (notably the GREAT BRITAIN), and had proved by\r\nthe severest tests the great merits of that metal as a material for\r\nshipbuilding. So convinced were the Directors of the B. and I. of the\r\nadvantages to be gained by the substitution of iron for wood, that\r\nthey purchased in 1850 the first iron paddle steamer of the fleet.\r\nThis steamer was named the FOYLE, and was one of the finest vessels\r\nafloat in her time.\r\n\r\nThe following year witnessed an extension of the Company’s\r\noperations, a regular service being established between Liverpool,\r\nSouth of England ports, and London; and also between Limerick and\r\nLondon. The latter was maintained by the auxiliary screw steamer\r\nROSE, and when this vessel was sold in 1852, the service was\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nTo meet the increased requirements of the trade, two large screw\r\nsteamers, the LADY EGLINTON and the NILE, were added to the fleet in\r\n1852.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, two of the B. and I.\r\nsteamers, one of which was the new steamer LADY EGLINTON, and the\r\nother the FOYLE, were chartered by the Government for the conveyance\r\nof troops and stores. In consequence of the withdrawal of these two\r\nsteamers from the Company’s service, and of the loss of the NILE off\r\nthe Cornish Coast, the Liverpool to London sailings were abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her Government service in the Black Sea, the LADY\r\nEGLINTON, in 1858, was employed for a short time as a Trans-Atlantic\r\nliner, making, in this capacity, two trips from Galway to Quebec and\r\nMontreal. In 1865, this famous steamer was placed in the hands of\r\nMessrs. Walpole, Webb & Bewley, shipbuilders, Dublin, by whom she was\r\nlengthened thirty feet.\r\n\r\nPrior to the declaration of War between the Northern and Southern\r\nStates of America, in 1861, the B. and I. Co. had maintained a\r\nregular service between Dublin and Wexford. The vessel employed in\r\nthis service was a small paddle steamer named the MARS. In 1863 the\r\nMARS was sold, crossed the Atlantic, and began the exciting career of\r\na blockade runner.\r\n\r\nTwo years later (1865) the LADY WODEHOUSE was built in Dublin, for\r\nthe Company, by Messrs. Walpole, Webb and Bewley, and in 1869 the\r\nsame builders launched another B. and I. liner, the COUNTESS OF\r\nDUBLIN. The year 1870 saw an important and advantageous change in\r\nthe fortunes of the Company, who purchased the interest and steamers\r\nof Messrs. Malcomson’s London-Dublin line, since which time the sea\r\ntrade between Dublin and London has been entirely in the hands of\r\nthe British and Irish Company. The vessels purchased from Messrs.\r\nMalcomson were the AVOCA and CYMBA. In 1879, the B. and I. Company\r\nwas registered as a Limited Company, and a new steamer, the LADY\r\nOLIVE, 1,096 tons, was added to the fleet. The LADY OLIVE was the\r\nlast iron vessel built for the Company, and the last of the compound\r\nengine type of steamer. All her successors—the present vessels of\r\nthe fleet—are built of steel, and fitted with triple-expansion\r\nengines. The first ship of the new type was the LADY MARTIN, of 1,356\r\ntons gross register, built in 1887 by Messrs. Workman & Clark, of\r\nBelfast. Her carrying capacity is much greater than that of any of\r\nher predecessors, and further increase of tonnage has marked all the\r\nvessels added to the fleet since. Her principal dimensions are—Length\r\n269 feet 6 inches, beam 34 feet 2 inches, and depth of hold 16 feet 4\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S.S. LADY WOLSELEY leaving Falmouth.]\r\n\r\nShe was followed in quick succession by the LADY HUDSON-KINAHAN,\r\nbuilt by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, Troon, in 1891; the\r\nLADY WOLSELEY, built by the Naval Construction and Armaments\r\nCompany, Barrow, in 1894; and the LADY ROBERTS, built by the Ailsa\r\nShipbuilding Company, Troon, in 1897. The last-named four steamers\r\nnow carry on the trade between the two capitals, the LADY OLIVE\r\nacting as stand-by ship. In their main features, all the vessels are\r\nvery similar, and vary only slightly in size and power, from the LADY\r\nMARTIN, of 1,365 tons, to the LADY ROBERTS, of 1,462 tons. It will be\r\nseen from the particulars given, that the steamers of the B. and I.\r\nCo. are amongst the largest coasting vessels in the United Kingdom.\r\nThe average berthing accommodation of each vessel is—120 saloon and\r\n50 second cabin, in addition to steerage passengers. Each vessel\r\nis fitted up on the most approved plan, and electrically lighted\r\nthroughout. Deck cabins and state rooms can be secured at a small\r\nextra charge. Smoking rooms are also provided, as well as bathrooms.\r\nIn the summer season pianos are put on board, and a full complement\r\nof stewards and stewardesses is carried. Under ordinary circumstances\r\nthe vessels average 13 knots per hour, which is quite fast enough for\r\nthe requirements of the trade; and it may be mentioned that they are\r\nwell able to hold their own with the majority of channel steamers.\r\nAny person travelling by these steamers will find that very few\r\nvessels will pass them, and those which do are probably some crack\r\nmail packets running short passages.\r\n\r\nThe ships of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company are as\r\nwell-known at Falmouth, Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth as\r\nthey are at the terminal ports of London and Dublin. Being so\r\nwell-found, roomy, comfortable, and up-to-date, and calling in at all\r\nthe principal southern ports, it is but natural that they should be\r\nfavourites with the holiday-making and touring public. So favourably\r\nare they held in this respect that during the “fine weather”\r\nmonths they seldom leave port without having a full complement of\r\npassengers, of whom (as has been stated) they are designed to carry a\r\nlarge number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steamship]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE BIBBY LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference has been made, in a previous chapter of this work, to\r\nthis old-established firm. It was engaged in shipping in 1807, five\r\nyears before the first British steamboat was launched. At that\r\nearly date the fleet consisted of small sailing vessels, but in\r\n1821 a regular line of ships to the East Indies was established.\r\nOf the old Liverpool shipowning firms which had their flag signal\r\nposts on Bidston Hill, only three now remain, viz., Messrs. Bibby,\r\nBrocklebank, and Sandbach Tinne.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 the firm, then under the guidance of the late Mr. James J.\r\nBibby, went into the steam trade, their first boats, the TIBER and\r\nARNO, being built on the Clyde by John Reid and Co.\r\n\r\nMr. Bibby, in 1859, commenced entrusting the building of the steamers\r\nof the line to Messrs. Harland and Wolff, and from that date every\r\nsucceeding vessel has been constructed by the same firm. It may be\r\ninteresting to recall that the late Sir Edward Harland, who was\r\nthe son of a personal friend of Mr. Bibby, commenced operations at\r\nBelfast with the order for the SICILIAN, VENETIAN and SYRIAN.\r\n\r\nMr. Bibby adopted the system of building his boats on commission, a\r\nsystem which ensures the greatest co-operation between builder and\r\nowner, and by which he secured the greatest advantage wherever his\r\ninterests were concerned.\r\n\r\nThe three boats last named were followed by the EGYPTIAN in 1861.\r\nAll of these vessels carried clipper bows with figure heads and\r\nbowsprits, but the succeeding ships were built with straight stems,\r\nan innovation, the credit of which (and of many other improvements\r\nnow generally adopted) is due to Mr. Bibby. The IBERIAN, ILLYRIAN and\r\nISTRIAN, all built in 1867, were the first of the fleet to carry the\r\nnew type of bow, and they were followed by a long succession of\r\nwell-known names, leading up to the present steamers on the Colombo\r\nand Rangoon and Southern Indian route.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern Bibby Liner.]\r\n\r\nThis service, which was established in 1891, quickly became prominent\r\namong the fast passenger services, and, as such, was early recognised\r\nby the Government and placed on the list of the special lines\r\navailable for officers, etc., returning at the expiration of their\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer vessel of the new service was the YORKSHIRE, and her\r\nsister ship the LANCASHIRE (though both somewhat smaller than the\r\nlater boats), still holds the blue ribbon of the route, having\r\nsteamed from Liverpool to Rangoon in the fastest time yet on record.\r\nThe CHESHIRE and SHROPSHIRE, which were the next steamers added to\r\nthe fleet were each about 1,500 tons larger than their immediate\r\npredecessors. They were provided with two entirely distinct and\r\nseparate sets of engines and propellers, a fact which at once\r\narrested attention in the East, and greatly added to the popularity\r\nwhich their other arrangements justified. Intending passengers will\r\nbe interested to know that with only one propeller in use, they are\r\ncapable of making as good progress as an ordinary trading steamer.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of two years (1893) the twin-screw steamer\r\nSTAFFORDSHIRE was built, and in her was embodied every improvement\r\nwhich experience and money could provide. She was at once generally\r\nacknowledged to be the most comfortable and the best ventilated type\r\nof steamer placed on the Eastern route.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1897, the twin-screw steamer DERBYSHIRE was added to the\r\nfleet. She is designed on the same lines as the STAFFORDSHIRE but\r\nbeing 7 feet longer and 3 feet broader, her staterooms are somewhat\r\nlarger. An important addition was made to the fleet in 1902, when the\r\ntwin-screw steamer WARWICKSHIRE was built. Her advent on the line was\r\nlooked forward to with much interest, and she has amply fulfilled\r\nall anticipations, and has secured a preference over any other\r\nsteamer for first-class passengers between Ceylon and Europe. Her\r\nlarge size admits of 200 berths being fitted, and the Main Saloon,\r\nDrawing room, Smoke room, Bath room, etc., are all increased in their\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nBy an ingenious arrangement (which is quite novel) every stateroom\r\nhas a port opening to the outside of the ship, and all the rooms\r\nare equally light and airy, while many of the rooms provided are\r\nfitted up for the accommodation of one or two passengers only. The\r\nWARWICKSHIRE has marked a new era in the equipment of large passenger\r\nsteamers, and the above mentioned Bibby Patent Stateroom is now being\r\nadopted by the principal Mail Lines in the construction of new boats.\r\nA twin-screw steamer, to be named the WORCESTERSHIRE, is now under\r\nconstruction at Belfast. She is designed closely on the lines of the\r\nWARWICKSHIRE, and is expected to be completed in good time to enable\r\nher to take her place in the Autumn sailings of 1904.\r\n\r\nThe steamers of the Bibby Line sail on alternate Thursdays from\r\nLiverpool, calling at Marseilles to embark the overland passengers\r\non the following Thursday. Circular tickets in connection with these\r\nsailings are issued for £15, which are available for a passage both\r\nways by any steamer of the fleet, or if passengers prefer it, they\r\nwill receive, free of additional cost, a first-class Railway ticket,\r\nvia Paris, for the journey one way overland to or from London.\r\n\r\nTravellers to and from Egypt, Palestine, etc., whether journeying\r\nround Spain or using the Marseilles route will find these steamers a\r\nconvenient and luxurious means of conveyance.\r\n\r\nThe public will be glad to know that passages can be secured for £3\r\n3s. for the fortnightly runs round from London to Liverpool. The\r\nsteamers usually leave Tilbury on Friday, and arrive in Liverpool on\r\nthe following Monday morning, thus affording a very pleasant week end\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nThe present fleet consists of the following modern fast Mail\r\nSteamships:—\r\n\r\n  LANCASHIRE                 4244 Tons.\r\n  YORKSHIRE                  4261   ”\r\n  CHESHIRE                   5775   ”\r\n  SHROPSHIRE                 5785   ”\r\n  STAFFORDSHIRE              6005 Tons.\r\n  DERBYSHIRE                 6636   ”\r\n  WARWICKSHIRE               7966   ”\r\n  WORCESTERSHIRE (Building)  7966   ”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CORK STEAMSHIP COMPANY, LIMITED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cork Steamship Company, as successors to the St. George Steam\r\nPacket Co., may justly be considered to be one of the oldest existing\r\nsteamship companies in the world. The original company (the St.\r\nGeorge), was formed in the Autumn of the year 1821, its headquarters\r\nbeing in Liverpool. An announcement concerning it appeared in the\r\nLiverpool “Mercury,” of the 12th October, 1821, stating:—\r\n\r\n  “A company has been formed here (Liverpool) for establishing steam\r\n  packets.... Two vessels of large dimensions are already contracted\r\n  for, and are now building by two experienced ship-builders in\r\n  this town, the machinery for both to be fitted by an engineer of\r\n  eminence; and the proprietors, we learn, are determined to spare no\r\n  expense in the equipment of the vessels to contribute to the safety\r\n  and comfort of the passengers.”\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this announcement the pioneer steam packet of the\r\nCompany, the ST. PATRICK, was launched from the yard of Mr. Thomas\r\nWilson, Liverpool, at 10-30 a.m. on the 21st April following.\r\n\r\nThis event created quite a sensation in the town, as she was, if\r\nnot the first steamer ever built in the port, certainly the finest\r\nspecimen of ship-building craft up to that date constructed there. So\r\ngreat was the interest displayed that every wall and pier from which\r\na view of the launch could be obtained was crowded with spectators.\r\nThis steamer ran for about two years between various ports in England\r\nand Ireland, and having in that time established a reputation for\r\nspeed and seaworthiness, she was purchased by a London Company to\r\ntrade between London and Lisbon. She was replaced by a second ST.\r\nPATRICK, a vessel of 300 tons burthen and 120 h.p., built by Clarke\r\nand Nickson, Liverpool, and launched from their yard on the 19th\r\nAugust, 1825. In the interim between the dates of the launch of the\r\nfirst and second ST. PATRICK, the Company had built or purchased\r\nquite a number of steamers. They had also established themselves in\r\nCork, and had built the premises situated on Penrose Quay, where\r\nto-day is carried on the business of the City of Cork Steam Packet\r\nCo., Limited.\r\n\r\nThe first three steamers employed by the St. George Co. in trading\r\nto and from Cork, were the LEE and SEVERN, both built in Liverpool\r\nin 1825 (the former for the Liverpool trade and the latter for the\r\nBristol trade), and the SUPERB, built by Mr. William Evans, London.\r\n\r\nThe St. George Co. extended its operations with marvellous rapidity,\r\nuntil its steamers were to be found in almost every port in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, and in the chief ports of Holland, Denmark, and\r\nRussia. It owned several famous steamers, one of which, on the\r\nauthority of Jeffry in “A Century of our Sea Story,” made the first\r\nsteam voyage between Great Britain and Australia. This was the SOPHIA\r\nJANE, a vessel of 256 tons and 50 h.p., built by William Evans,\r\nLondon, and first employed between London Bridge and Gravesend. When\r\nfirst placed on this station, her owners were involved in an action\r\nat law to prove their right to navigate the river. They won their\r\naction from the Watermen’s Company, and soon the first Gravesend\r\nSteam Ferry was started. The SOPHIA JANE plied on the Thames until\r\n1828, when she began to make longer voyages, running for some months\r\nbetween Portsmouth and Plymouth, afterwards under the St. George\r\nflag, between Liverpool and Douglas (Isle of Man), later between\r\nLondon and Calais, and finally made her great voyage from England\r\nto Australia. She arrived at Port Jackson Heads in May, 1831, three\r\nmonths after leaving the Thames, thus making the first steam voyage\r\nbetween Great Britain and Australia, and the longest voyage under\r\nsteam down almost to the fifties.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the management of the St. George Co. was not all that\r\ncould be desired, and the late Mr. Ebenezer Pike, of Bessborough,\r\nBlackrock, County Cork, convened a meeting of the shareholders which\r\nwas held at Cork on the 17th February, 1843. Prior to the meeting,\r\nMr. Pike had forwarded to each shareholder a copy of a circular in\r\nwhich he proposed (_a_) to form a Company with a capital of £50,000\r\nin 1,000 shares of £50 each; and (_b_) to build a new steamer of 500\r\nto 600 tons burthen and 300 h.p.\r\n\r\nThe circular was discussed at the meeting, but no definite decision\r\nwas arrived at. Mr. Pike, however, did not allow the matter to\r\nrest. In October following, so far as Cork was concerned, the title\r\n“St. George” was dropped, and the title “City of Cork Steamship\r\nCo.” (afterwards shortened to “Cork Steamship Co.”) was adopted in\r\nits stead. Mr. William Wilson, the founder of the firm of Wilson,\r\nSon & Co., was the first general manager at Cork, and Mr. McTear\r\nthe Liverpool agent. Nor did Mr. Pike abandon the idea of the new\r\nsteamer, for on the 26th September, 1843, Messrs. Thomas Vernon & Son\r\nbuilt to his order the steamship NIMROD.\r\n\r\nThe following year the Company was virtually re-constructed, and the\r\nCork Steamship Co. was formed with a capital of £170,000, in 1,700\r\nshares of £100 each. The first Directors were, Messrs. Ebenezer\r\nPike, John Gould, James Connell, Joseph Hayes, and William Lane, all\r\nmerchants belonging to Cork.\r\n\r\nAt the date of the re-construction of the Company, the St. George\r\nSteam Packet Co. owned about 20 steamers. Most of them were disposed\r\nof to various buyers, the new management retaining seven, viz., the\r\nLEE, SEVERN, TIGER, JUPITER, VICTORY, OCEAN, and SIRIUS.\r\n\r\nThe LEE and SEVERN have already been referred to. The TIGER was a\r\nsteamer of 389 tons, built at Hull in 1838. She was 156 feet long,\r\nby 26 feet beam, and 18 feet deep. She was rigged as a two-masted\r\nschooner and had a tiger figurehead. Originally she was intended for\r\nthe St. George Hull and Hamburg service; was taken over by the Cork\r\nSteamship Co. in 1844, and sold by them in 1851 to London buyers.\r\n\r\nThe JUPITER was a vessel of 360 tons, built at Greenock in 1835.\r\nTransferred to the Cork Steamship Co. in 1844, and sold by them to\r\nLondon buyers in 1847.\r\n\r\nThe VICTORY was a Liverpool built steamer of 256 tons, built in 1832.\r\nThe Cork Steamship Co. did not retain possession of her long, but\r\nsold her in 1846 to the Malcomsons of Waterford, who employed her in\r\ntheir Limerick and London service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. EBENEZER PIKE, J.P. (late Chairman Cork Steamship\r\nCo.).]\r\n\r\nThe OCEAN was a steamer of 300 tons, her principal dimensions\r\nbeing 154 by 22 by 15. She was built on the Mersey in 1836, and in\r\n1838 made a record passage from Liverpool to Cork in 23 hours. She\r\nwas intended for the general Coasting Service of the St. George\r\nCo., and had the honour of acting as tender to her more famous\r\nsister-ship the SIRIUS, on the occasion of the latter’s historic\r\nvoyage to New York. Six years later when she had become the property\r\nof the Cork Steamship Co., she rendered valuable service to the\r\nSteampacket VANGUARD, belonging to the Dublin and Glasgow Steam\r\nPacket Co. During a gale on the 14th December, 1844, the VANGUARD,\r\ninward bound with a valuable cargo and a number of passengers, was\r\nforced on to the rocks about a quarter of a mile inside of Roche’s\r\nPoint Lighthouse. This occurred about 4 a.m., and soon afterwards\r\nthe OCEAN, inwards from Bristol to Cork, passed the spot. The\r\nVANGUARD’s signals of distress were noticed, and the Captain of the\r\nOCEAN (Caldbeck), in spite of the heavy sea that was running, at\r\nonce launched his boats, and succeeded in rescuing the VANGUARD’s\r\npassengers. The steamer was afterwards towed off the rocks and taken\r\nto Passage for repairs. The OCEAN continued in the service of the\r\nCork Steamship Co. until 1853, when she was purchased by the Chester\r\nand Holyhead Railway Co. The remaining steamer transferred from the\r\nSt. George Co., was the famous SIRIUS. The SIRIUS was built in 1837\r\nby Menzies & Co., Perth, and engined by J. Wingate & Co., Glasgow;\r\nand cost £27,000. Her length was 208 feet, her breadth 25 feet,\r\nand her depth 18 feet. She had two masts and one funnel, and a dog\r\nfigure-head, holding between the fore-paws a star, representing the\r\ndog-star Sirius, after which the vessel was named. On the occasion\r\nof her memorable voyage to New York, she sailed from London on the\r\n28th March, 1838, under the command of Lieut. Richard Roberts, R.N.,\r\nand called at Cork Harbour to coal and to embark the mails and\r\npassengers. The OCEAN arrived from Liverpool on the 3rd April with\r\nmails and passengers to be transferred to the SIRIUS. Next morning\r\nat 10 o’clock the SIRIUS got under way, being accompanied as far as\r\nthe entrance to the harbour by the OCEAN. There, a brief stoppage was\r\nmade while the OCEAN went alongside the SIRIUS to bring off a number\r\nof ladies and gentlemen who had been permitted to accompany their\r\nfriends thus far, the steamers exchanged salutes, and then the SIRIUS\r\ncontinued her course, being watched with keen interest until she\r\ndisappeared beneath the horizon. She arrived at New York at 10 p.m.\r\non the 22nd April, and thus brought to a successful termination the\r\nfirst voyage ever made by a passenger steamer from Europe to America.\r\nShe made two Trans-Atlantic voyages, and afterwards returned to\r\nthe Home and Continental Services. When she became the property of\r\nthe Cork Steamship Co. she was employed in the Glasgow, Dublin and\r\nCork Service, in which she continued until 1847. On the evening of\r\nthe 15th June of that year, she sailed from Dublin to Cork with a\r\ngeneral cargo, and forty passengers. All went well until 4 a.m. on\r\nthe 16th, when she encountered a dense fog, and went on the rocks in\r\nBallycotton Bay. Twelve passengers and two seamen were unfortunately\r\ndrowned by the capsizing of a boat which had been launched, but the\r\nrest of the passengers and crew were saved by means of a rope which\r\nwas passed from the ship to the shore. The vessel itself went to\r\npieces on the 22nd June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIRIUS P. S. Cork Steamship Co.]\r\n\r\nNearly all the steamers retained by the new management were sold to\r\nvarious owners within a few years from the reconstruction of the\r\nCompany, and new and more powerful vessels substituted for them. The\r\nfirst of these, the NIMROD, was the first iron steamship owned in\r\nCork. She was built by Thomas Vernon & Son, Liverpool, to Mr. Pike’s\r\norder in 1843, and was 177 feet long, 25 feet beam, and 16 feet deep.\r\nHer tonnage was 583 tons, and she had two masts, a clipper bow, and a\r\nhuntsman (Nimrod) figurehead.\r\n\r\nThe AJAX, a vessel of about 600 tons, was added in 1845, and the\r\nPREUSSISCHER ADLER, of 563 tons, also built in 1845, was purchased\r\nby the Company. The latter steamer was designed as an armed yacht\r\nfor the late King of Prussia. She was built at Liverpool, and\r\ncost £32,000. She was a broad-beamed paddle-boat, having a beam\r\nof 28 feet, her length being 185 feet, and her depth 17 feet. She\r\nwas rigged as a two masted schooner, with a cutwater, an eagle\r\nfigurehead. The Company, after purchase, added to her length, and for\r\nthis purpose placed her in the Rushbrook Dry Dock, Cork, belonging\r\nto the Channel Dry Docks and Engineering Co.; the PREUSSISCHER ADLER\r\nbeing the first steamer to enter this dock. As originally designed\r\nher paddle-boxes were so constructed as to be capable of being turned\r\ndown over her sides, in order that two large swivel guns which she\r\ncarried on deck, might have a free range all round.\r\n\r\nShe remained in the service of the Company until 1884, when she was\r\nbroken up in London.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Messrs. R. and J. Lecky, of Cork, built a small screw\r\nsteamer to the order of the Cork Steamship Co. She was named the\r\nBLARNEY, and was only 118 feet long, 19 feet broad, and 11 feet deep.\r\nNotwithstanding her diminutive size, she ran for a number of years\r\nbetween Liverpool and Havre, and was eventually sold to a Liverpool\r\nfirm in 1854. It is noteworthy that the BLARNEY was the first\r\ncross-channel steamer built in Cork by R. & J. Lecky, and was the\r\nfirst screw steamer built for the Cork Steamship Co.\r\n\r\nThe year 1850 saw the Cork Steamship Co. involved in the most serious\r\nstruggle which probably ever occurred in the coasting steamship\r\ntrade. It began by the City of Dublin Co., at the solicitation of\r\nthe Waterford and Kilkenny Railway Co., running opposition steamers\r\nto Waterford. The City of Dublin Co., in addition to their Liverpool\r\nand Dublin Service, had maintained for many years a regular service\r\nof steamers between Liverpool and Belfast. Mr. Joseph Malcomson\r\n(Waterford Steamship Co.) was a Director of the Cork Steamship Co.,\r\nand his firm had a large financial interest in that Company. It was,\r\ntherefore, to be expected that these two Companies would form staunch\r\nallies in any struggle, the more so, when the City of Dublin Co.,\r\nin conjunction with the British and Irish Steampacket Co., extended\r\nthe opposition to Cork. The Cork and Waterford Steamship Companies\r\ncarried the war into their opponents’ territory. They put a steamer\r\non the station between London and the South and East of Ireland once\r\na week, between Liverpool and Belfast twice a week, and between\r\nLiverpool and Dublin, daily. The City of Dublin Co. offered to make\r\ncontracts with merchants in Cork and Waterford, undertaking to carry\r\ntheir traffic freight free for three months, in response to which the\r\nWaterford Co. threatened to place two steamers on the Holyhead and\r\nDublin station in conjunction with the Chester and Holyhead Railway\r\nCo.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between the various companies was fiercely maintained\r\nfor over twelve months, until in April, 1851, upon the suggestion of\r\nMr. Malcomson, an interview took place between a Director of the\r\nCity of Dublin Steam Packet Co. and himself (as representing the Cork\r\nand Waterford Companies), at which meeting the companies concerned\r\narrived at an amicable basis of settlement.\r\n\r\nIn this settlement the City of Dublin Co. agreed to transfer their\r\nLiverpool and Belfast service to the Cork Steamship Co. This\r\narrangement held good until 1854. On the 14th January of the year\r\nnamed a deputation from the Cork and Belfast Companies met in\r\nDublin. There were present, Mr. Pike (Managing Director) and Mr.\r\nGlover (Secretary), of the Cork Steamship Co.; Mr. W. R. S. Lepper\r\n(Chairman) and Mr. Valentine, of the Belfast Co. The meeting was\r\nconducted in a most friendly manner, and it was arranged that the\r\nTELEGRAPH (Belfast Co.’s steamer) should be at once withdrawn from\r\nthe Liverpool and Cork service, and the MINERVA (Cork Co.’s steamer)\r\nfrom the Liverpool and Belfast service. The year 1854 witnessed a\r\ngreat stream of emigrants from Cork. According to a paragraph in the\r\n“Cork Constitution” of that date:—\r\n\r\n“On Saturday, 1st April, the MINERVA left with 467 adult emigrants,\r\n79 children, and 8 infants, besides other passengers. The vessel\r\nwas so crowded she had to leave 200 passengers behind. The NIMROD\r\nleaves every Wednesday, and is freighted with emigrants to a similar\r\nextent. This continual stream of emigrants has been going on for a\r\nconsiderable time.”\r\n\r\nWhile the war cloud was gathering over Europe, which in bursting\r\nproduced the Crimean War, the Cork Steamship Co. had on the stocks\r\na steamer, afterwards named the CORMORANT. In the equipment of this\r\nsteamer a novel feature had been introduced, viz., iron masts.\r\nThese masts, of which she carried three, were exceptionally tall\r\nand graceful, and so well buckled that not a joint was visible. The\r\nwhole appearance of the vessel was so smart that she excited general\r\nadmiration, and was selected by the Government as a transport. While\r\nshe was lying at Portsmouth, after the embarkation of the 13th\r\nLancers for the seat of war, Her (late) Majesty Queen Victoria,\r\naccompanied by the Prince Consort, came on board to inspect her\r\nbefore sailing. After inspecting the troopers’ quarters, and\r\nadmiring some of their horses, Her Majesty discovered that the\r\nship’s masts were not wood but iron. She was so impressed with their\r\ngraceful appearance that she gave instructions for full particulars\r\nof them to be taken by the Dockyard officials.\r\n\r\nTwo other steamers of the Company—the DODO (nicknamed the rolling\r\nDodo) and the ALBATROSS—were also engaged by the Government as\r\ntransports. At the Crimea, as well as at home, the CORMORANT’s masts\r\nexcited great interest. One day a Turkish Admiral came on board, and\r\na quartermaster was told off to show the distinguished visitor round\r\nthe ship. The Admiral came to the mainmast, examined it, tapped it,\r\nand turning to his attendant, said:—\r\n\r\n“I-ron?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your Excellency.”\r\n\r\n“Sō-lid?”\r\n\r\n“No, you blithering fool; it’s hollow,” was the reply, except that\r\nthe adjective used was more forcible than the one we have given.\r\n\r\nAmongst the vessels which were at the Crimea at this time was an\r\nAmerican schooner, the captain of which was very proud of his craft,\r\nand was continually boasting of her beauty and of the lofty masts she\r\ncarried. He “challenged creation to find her ditto.” One day when he\r\nwas boasting in his usual strain, Captain Byrne, who was present,\r\nsaid quietly, “What might the height of your masts be, captain?”\r\n“Every inch of 90 feet, I guess,” replied the American. “Well,” said\r\nCaptain Byrne, “I can show you a ship with taller masts than that.”\r\n“Where?” “In this harbour, on my ship.”\r\n\r\nTo settle the dispute the two captains proceeded to the CORMORANT.\r\nNow it must be confessed that the CORMORANT’s masts had not been\r\nscraped for some time, and were so streaked with paint and grease\r\nthat they might easily be mistaken for pine. The American captain\r\ncame to the foot of the mainmast and looked up. “Great Cæsar! What\r\nheight do you call that?”\r\n\r\n“120 feet,” replied Captain Byrne.\r\n\r\n“Is it all one piece?” asked the other.\r\n\r\n“There’s not a splice in it from heel to truck,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“I calculate that timber was raised in Oregon,” said the American.\r\n\r\n“No, it was not.”\r\n\r\n“Well, do tell, where did it grow?”\r\n\r\n“That, sir,” quoth Captain Byrne, “was raised in Cork.”\r\n\r\nA collision occurred on the 10th July, 1866, resulting in the total\r\nloss of H.M.S. AMAZON and the Cork steamship OSPREY, with a number\r\nof passengers, chiefly ladies. The OSPREY was outward bound from\r\nLiverpool to Antwerp, with a general cargo. She was under the command\r\nof the late Captain Bertridge, and carried a crew of 14 hands. When\r\noff Portland, at 1 o’clock in the morning, the look-out reported a\r\nsteamer approaching, which proved to be H.M.S. AMAZON. By a fatal\r\nerror of judgment (for which he was dismissed the service) on the\r\npart of the officer in command, the AMAZON crashed into the OSPREY.\r\nWhile the vessels were locked together the crew of the Cork steamer\r\nscrambled over the bows of the man-of-war, leaving to Captain\r\nBertridge the task of saving his family (who were on board) and\r\npassengers. These he placed in one of the boats belonging to the\r\nOSPREY, cut the lashings, and had barely done so when his steamer\r\nsank, dragging the boat into the whirlpool as it sank, and drowning\r\nall in it, except the captain and one passenger. The captain’s wife\r\nhad previously jumped into the sea from the boat, and was rescued and\r\ntaken on board the AMAZON. The latter vessel was so injured by the\r\ncollision that she also sank about four hours later, but all on board\r\ntook to the boats and were landed at Torquay.\r\n\r\nAbout this period the question of the Company’s house-flag began\r\nto be agitated. The CORMORANT, under Captain Croft, was lying at\r\nPenrose Quay, with her house-flag floating from the masthead. A\r\nsection of the Channel Fleet happened to be in port at the time, and\r\nCaptain Croft was surprised to receive a message from the Admiral\r\ncommanding, asking why the CORMORANT was flying his (the Admiral’s)\r\nflag. Captain Croft replied that the flag he carried had been his\r\nCompany’s house-flag for the last twenty years, and of his Company’s\r\npredecessor for over twenty years before that. To this the Admiral\r\nvery courteously replied that he personally would not interfere\r\nwith the use of the flag, but that as the Government had adopted it\r\nas an Admiral’s flag, it was possible that some difficulties might\r\narise later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RISSA S.S. Cork Steamship Company.]\r\n\r\nThe question of the flag was next raised at Bussorah, in the Persian\r\nGulf, on the 7th November, 1882. The DOTTEREL had finished loading,\r\nand was getting ready for sea, when a message came from H.M.S. DRYAD,\r\nwhich was in the roadstead, asking why the DOTTEREL dared to carry\r\nthe Admiral’s flag, and stating it must be pulled down at once.\r\n\r\n“Tell your commander,” said Captain Dobson, “that that flag is\r\nmy Company’s house-flag, and that I will not lower it without\r\ninstructions from my owners.”\r\n\r\nThe boat went back with this message, and Captain Dobson immediately\r\nsent a man aloft to grease the backstays and the masthead, having\r\nfirst nailed the flag to it.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the boat returned with a petty officer, whose\r\ninstructions were, if the master of the DOTTEREL did not lower the\r\nflag, he was to send one of his men aloft to do so. “All right,” said\r\nCaptain Dobson. “I shan’t pull my flag down; you can do what you\r\nplease.” The officer turned to his men and gave his orders. One tar\r\nafter another tried to shin up the mast without success, and after\r\nseveral attempts the officer had to return and report the failure of\r\nhis mission, and the DOTTEREL proceeded to sea.[24]\r\n\r\nThe commander of the man-of-war having reported to the Admiralty, a\r\ncorrespondence ensued between that Department of the Government and\r\nthe Cork Steamship Co., resulting in the Company placing a blue star\r\nin the centre of the St. George’s Cross on a white ensign, which now\r\nconstitutes the distinguishing house-flag of that Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the business of the Cork Steamship Co. had increased to such\r\nan extent, it was considered desirable to separate the coasting from\r\nthe foreign services, and to form two distinct companies. This was\r\naccordingly done, the former being registered under the title of the\r\nCity of Cork Steam Packet Co., Ltd., and the latter under the style\r\nof the Cork Steamship Co., Ltd. Mr. Ebenezer Pike died in the year\r\n1883, and was succeeded by his son, Mr. Joseph Pike, of Dunsland, co.\r\nCork, as Chairman and Managing Director of the Company.\r\n\r\nWhen the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894, one of the first\r\nforeign trading steamers to pass through the canal was the IBIS,\r\nbelonging to the Cork Steamship Co. The Cork Steamship Co.’s steamer\r\nLESTRIS was the first steamer to enter Flushing Docks on the 8th\r\nSeptember, 1873, being locked in with the King of Holland’s yacht.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. JOSEPH PIKE, J.P., D.L., Chairman Cork Steamship\r\nCo.]\r\n\r\nThe later years of the Company have been unproductive of historical\r\nincidents, perhaps not altogether to the regret of the shareholders.\r\nThe older steamers have been disposed of from time to time, and\r\nreplaced by modern steamers of larger tonnage and greater power.\r\nInstead of steamers of 500 to 600 tons, the fleet at the present time\r\n(1903) consists of 16 powerful vessels, varying from 1,000 to 2,400\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Another account which bears the stamp of authority states that\r\nCaptain Dobson did not carry off his flag in the manner stated. He\r\nlowered it under protest, and it was carried on board the man-of-war,\r\nbut afterwards returned to the Company, and is now retained at the\r\nHead Office, Cork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CUNARD STEAMSHIP COMPANY, LIMITED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems incredible that less than three-quarters of a century\r\nago steamers were unknown on the Atlantic. The mail-boats of that\r\ndate were wretched old Government 10-gun “coffin brigs,” slow and\r\nuncertain in their passages. But there were men, even in those\r\ndays, who dreamed of a time to come when steamers should cross the\r\nocean with the regularity, though not with the speed, of railway\r\ntrains. Amongst these enthusiasts was Mr. Samuel Cunard, a shipowner\r\nof Halifax, Nova Scotia. For years he had striven to realise his\r\nidea, but not having sufficient capital of his own, and not being\r\nable to induce his friends to invest in his enterprise, he had to\r\nwait his opportunity. At last the long-waited-for opportunity came,\r\nand he seized it. The British Admiralty issued a circular stating\r\nthat the mails would be transferred to a steam packet service, if a\r\nsatisfactory tender were sent in. When this circular came into the\r\nhands of Mr. Cunard he again appealed to the merchants of Halifax\r\nand others for assistance; and being unsuccessful in his application\r\nhe came to Britain and fortunately became acquainted with Mr. R.\r\nNapier. Mr. Napier introduced him to Mr. George Burns who, in his\r\nturn, introduced him to Mr. David MacIver, of Liverpool. In the\r\ncourse of a few days, chiefly through the influence of Mr. Burns,\r\nthe requisite capital, £270,000, was obtained, and soon afterwards a\r\ncontract for seven years between the Government and Samuel Cunard,\r\nGeorge Burns and David MacIver was signed, and the Cunard Steamship\r\nCo. was launched. Before their arrangements were finally adjusted,\r\nthe Admiralty re-modelled the agreement, requiring that the service\r\nshould be performed by four suitable steamers (instead of three,\r\nas originally stated), and that fixed dates of sailing should\r\nbe adhered to, but in consideration of the increased services the\r\nsubsidy was raised from £60,000 to £81,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. CAMPANIA (Cunard Steamship Company) at\r\nLiverpool Landing Stage.]\r\n\r\nThe official title of the Company was “The British and North American\r\nRoyal Mail Steam Packet Co.,” but this unwieldy title soon gave place\r\nto one of world-wide reputation, “The Cunard Line.”\r\n\r\nThe first steamer despatched by the co-partnery was one of Messrs.\r\nBurns’ Liverpool and Glasgow steamers, the UNICORN. She sailed from\r\nLiverpool for Halifax and Boston, under the command of Captain\r\nDouglas, on Saturday morning, 16th May, 1840. She carried the mails\r\nand a limited number of saloon passengers, the passage rates being—to\r\nHalifax £30, to Boston £33 each. The BRITANNIA, the pioneer steamer\r\nof the British and North American Steam Packet Co., was despatched\r\non the 4th July, 1840, being the first of four wooden paddle-wheel\r\nsteamships, the others being the ACADIA, CALEDONIA and COLUMBIA.\r\nThese vessels were uniform in size and power, being 207 feet long,\r\n34 feet 4 inches broad, and 22 feet 6 inches deep. Their gross\r\ntonnage was 1,154 tons, and their engines of 740 I.H.P. drove them\r\nat an average speed of 8½ knots per hour. The reception given to the\r\nBRITANNIA on the termination of her maiden voyage by the citizens of\r\nBoston was most enthusiastic. Nor was the goodwill of the merchants\r\nconfined to banquets and complimentary speeches for, when the\r\nBRITANNIA was ice-bound in Boston Harbour, in February, 1844, they\r\nliberated her by cutting a canal through the ice, seven miles long\r\nand 100 feet wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUROPA and AMERICA. Cunard Steamship Co.]\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the Company added to their fleet the HIBERNIA, and in 1845\r\nthe CAMBRIA, each of 1,040 I.H.P. and of 1,422 tons gross, with an\r\naverage speed of 9¼ knots. On the expiration of the Postal Contract\r\nthe Government stipulated that the existing mail service should\r\nbe doubled, that the steamers of the Company should be capable of\r\ncarrying guns of the largest calibre, and that a steamer should\r\nleave Liverpool every Saturday (calling at Holyhead if required)\r\nfor New York and Boston alternately; the Boston steamer to call at\r\nHalifax, and the New York steamer to do so also, if required by the\r\nLords Commissioners of the Admiralty. In consideration of these\r\naugmented services the annual subsidy was increased to £173,340, at\r\nwhich figure it remained for twenty years (1847 to 1867). To meet\r\nthe new requirements, the AMERICA, NIAGARA, CANADA and EUROPA, of\r\n1,825 tons, and 2,000 I.H.P., with an average speed of ten and a\r\nquarter knots, were built and added to the fleet. A few years later\r\nthe Collins Line, heavily subsidised, was started with the avowed\r\nobject of “sweeping the Cunarders off the Atlantic.” This opposition\r\nlasted until 1858, when, having lost two ships, and being refused\r\nany further subsidy by the United States Government, the Collins\r\nCompany collapsed, and the remaining ships were withdrawn. During the\r\ncontinuance of this opposition the Cunard Company added steadily to\r\ntheir fleet larger and more powerful steamers. The ASIA and AFRICA\r\nwere built in 1850, and were each 266 feet by 40 feet by 27·2 feet,\r\nof 2,226 tons gross, with engines of 2,400 I.H.P., and of an average\r\nspeed of 12·5 knots. These were followed in 1852 by the ARABIA, the\r\nlast of the wooden paddle steamers. She was 285 feet long, 40 feet\r\n8 inches broad, and 29 feet deep. Her engines indicated 3,250 H.P.,\r\nand her average speed was 13 knots per hour. Three years later, 1855,\r\nthe first iron mail steamship was built for the Cunard Company. She\r\nwas named the PERSIA, and was nearly one hundred feet longer than the\r\nlargest of her predecessors. Her principal dimensions were—Length 376\r\nfeet, breadth 45 feet 3 inches, depth 31 feet 6 inches. Her gross\r\ntonnage was 4,000 tons, and her engines indicated 4,000 H.P., giving\r\na speed of 13·8 knots per hour. In 1853 the Company established\r\n(primarily as auxiliaries to their Atlantic service) branch lines\r\nbetween Liverpool and Havre, and Liverpool and the principal ports in\r\nthe Mediterranean, Adriatic, Levant, Bosphorus, and Black Sea. For\r\nthese branch lines the screw steamers SYDNEY, AUSTRALIAN, ANDES and\r\nALPS were built in 1852, followed by the JURA in 1854 and the ETNA\r\nin 1855. War having been declared against Russia the four last-named\r\nsteamers, in addition to the CAMBRIA, NIAGARA, EUROPA and ARABIA,\r\nwere engaged by the Government as troopships. The Cunard Company had\r\nin 1854 purchased the steamer EMEU, and she was immediately chartered\r\nto the Government. The EMEU was the first troopship to arrive out\r\nat the commencement of the Crimean War, and in the seventeen months\r\nfollowing she conveyed upwards of 17,000 troops to the Crimea. A few\r\nyears later (1862) the famous SCOTIA (the last of the paddle-wheel\r\nsteamers) was built. In 1878 she was sold to the Telegraph\r\nConstruction Company, who converted her into a screw steamer. The\r\nsame year (1862) the Cunard Company ordered their first screw steamer\r\nfor the Atlantic trade. This was the CHINA S.S., now converted into\r\na four-masted barque and named the THEODOR. She was followed in 1864\r\nby the CUBA, in 1865 by the JAVA, and in 1867 by the RUSSIA, of 2,960\r\ntons gross and 3,100 I.H.P. After sailing for many years under the\r\nCunard Flag, the RUSSIA was sold to the “American Line.” Her new\r\nowners lengthened her, gave her a fourth mast, and altered her name\r\nto the WAESLAND. She finally sank off Holyhead, after colliding with\r\nthe S.S. HARMONIDES, on the 5th March, 1902.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCOTIA. Cunard Steamship Co.]\r\n\r\nThe Company’s Postal Contract having expired on the 31st December,\r\n1867, a new contract was entered into with the Postmaster-General for\r\none year, whereby the Cunard Company undertook to despatch a steamer\r\nfrom Liverpool to New York, calling at Queenstown, returning from\r\nNew York every Wednesday, also calling at Queenstown. The payment\r\nfor this service was £80,000, which sum was further reduced the\r\nfollowing year to £70,000 per annum for several years. Under the last\r\ncontract, which was for the period named, the Company guaranteed\r\nto sail a steamer from Liverpool (calling at Queenstown) to Boston\r\nevery Tuesday, in addition to the mail service from Liverpool to New\r\nYork every Saturday. The last-mentioned contract expired on the 31st\r\nDecember, 1876, on which date a new system of postal remuneration\r\ncame into operation based on the amount of correspondence carried\r\nper voyage, under which system the Cunard Company has carried the\r\nmails to the present time. It will thus be seen that the continuity\r\nof their mail service has continued unbroken for upwards of sixty\r\nyears. The invention of compound engines was the latest evolution of\r\nmarine engineering engaging attention in 1869-70. The Directors of\r\nthe Cunard Company quickly realised that the saving effected by the\r\nuse of compound engines was so considerable, without reduction of\r\nspeed, that their adoption was an imperative necessity. This decision\r\nwas arrived at too late to furnish with the new style of engines the\r\nABYSSINIA and ALGERIA, each of about 3,300 tons and 2,480 I.H.P.,\r\njust completed by Messrs. J. & G. Thomson, and placed on the New\r\nYork station; but the BATAVIA, then on the stocks to the order of\r\nanother company, was purchased and supplied with machinery on the\r\nnew principle; and an order was given to the same builders (Messrs.\r\nDenny, Dumbarton) for a similar vessel of rather larger tonnage to\r\nbe named the PARTHIA. A further extension of the Company’s business\r\ntook place in 1872, by the establishment of a direct line of steamers\r\nbetween the Clyde and the West Indies. The TRINIDAD and the DEMERARA,\r\ntwo sister ships of about 2,000 tons each, were built that year,\r\nand placed on the station, but after about twelve months’ trading\r\nthey were withdrawn, and sent to supplement the Company’s service\r\nin the Mediterranean. During the succeeding six years the fleet was\r\nincreased by the addition of seven large steamers, all fitted with\r\ncompound engines, the last and largest of which was the GALLIA, of\r\n4,809 tons and 5,300 I.H.P.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIA. Cunard Steamship Co.]\r\n\r\nIn 1878 it was considered expedient to consolidate the interests\r\nof the partners by registering the Company under the Limited\r\nLiability Acts, and a Joint Stock Company was formed with a capital\r\nof £2,000,000, of which £1,200,000 was issued and taken up by the\r\nfamilies of Cunard, Burns and MacIver. No shares were offered to the\r\npublic until 1880, when a prospectus was issued intimating that “it\r\nwas now proposed to issue the balance of the capital.” The available\r\nshares were rapidly subscribed for, the representatives of the three\r\nfounders retaining a large financial interest in the Company. About\r\nthis period steel was engaging the attention of shipbuilders as a\r\nsubstitute for iron. The Cunard Directors were so convinced of the\r\nsuperiority of the former, especially where speed was a desideratum,\r\nthat they ordered a steel steamship from Messrs. J. & G. Thomson,\r\nto be larger and more powerful than any steamer previously built,\r\nthe GREAT EASTERN alone excepted. This monster vessel, which was\r\nnamed the SERVIA, was completed in 1881. Her dimensions were—Length\r\n515 feet, breadth 52-1/10 feet, depth 37 feet. Her gross tonnage\r\nwas 7,392. Her engines were compound—with seven steel boilers—and\r\ndeveloped 10,000 I.H.P., producing a speed of 17 knots per hour.\r\nShe was fitted in the most substantial and beautiful manner for the\r\naccommodation of 480 cabin and 750 steerage passengers, and embodied\r\nall the most modern appliances conducive to comfort and safety. She\r\nwas the first of the Cunard Fleet to be equipped with incandescent\r\nelectric lamps. The same year, the CATALONIA, 4,841 tons and 3,200\r\nI.H.P., was built for the Boston service, and two more for the same\r\nservice in the following year. These were the PAVONIA, of 5,587\r\ntons and 4,000 I.H.P., built by Messrs. J. & G. Thomson; and the\r\nCEPHALONIA, 5,517 tons and 4,000 I.H.P., by Messrs. Laird Brothers,\r\nBirkenhead.\r\n\r\nA second steel steamship was built in 1883 for the New York Mail\r\nService. This was the AURANIA, built by Messrs. J. & G. Thomson,\r\nand her dimensions are 470 feet by 57-2/10 feet by 37-2/10 feet.\r\nHer tonnage is 7,269, and she is fitted with compound engines of\r\n9,500 I.H.P., and attaining a speed of 17½ knots per hour. She was\r\ntaken up by the Government as a transport in October, 1899, and\r\nso valuable did she prove for this service that she was retained\r\nuntil the early part of 1903. In 1884 the Directors purchased the\r\ncelebrated iron steamship OREGON, built by Messrs. John Elder & Co.\r\nShe was 501 feet by 54-2/10 feet by 38 feet, and of 7,375 tons and\r\n13,500 I.H.P.; speed 18 knots per hour. On her first and second\r\nvoyage she did not distinguish herself, but on her third voyage she\r\nmade the passage from Queenstown to New York in 6 days 10 hours 9\r\nminutes, thereby excelling all previous records, and earning for\r\nherself the title of “The Greyhound of the Atlantic.” Towards the\r\nclose of 1884 the UMBRIA—the first of two steel steamships ordered\r\nfrom Messrs. Elder—was delivered, and she was followed early in 1885\r\nby her sister ship the ETRURIA. The following description of the\r\nETRURIA applies also to the UMBRIA: Length 501-6/10 feet by 57-2/10\r\nfeet by 38-2/10 feet; gross tonnage 7,718 tons. The promenade deck,\r\nwhich extends over the full breadth of the ship for nearly 300\r\nfeet amidships, is reserved for the sole use of the first-class\r\npassengers. The vessel easily accommodates 550 first-class passengers\r\nand 800 third-class. The state rooms are replete with all the\r\nfittings usual in first-class vessels of the most modern type, and\r\na number of them are arranged en suite for family use. The hull is\r\ndivided into ten watertight compartments, and most of the bulkheads\r\nare carried to the upper deck, while they are fitted with waterproof\r\nand fireproof doors, which afford access to all parts of the ship.\r\nThe engines indicate 14,500 H.P., and are compound, having three\r\ninverted cylinders—one high-pressure 71 in. in diameter and two\r\nlow-pressure, each 105 in. in diameter. The average speed of both\r\nsteamers may be set down at 18½ knots per hour. The fastest passage\r\nof the ETRURIA was when she established a new record by making the\r\npassage from Queenstown to New York in 5 days 20 hours 55 minutes,\r\nthe UMBRIA’s best record being 5 days 22 hours 7 minutes. The next\r\nimportant addition to the fleet was the CAMPANIA, launched from the\r\nyard of the Fairfield Shipbuilding Co., Govan, on the 8th September,\r\n1892. Five months later—February, 1893—there was launched from the\r\nsame yard her sister ship the LUCANIA. From the official description\r\nof the CAMPANIA, it appears that her length over all is 620 feet,\r\nextreme breadth 65 feet 3 inches, depth from upper deck 43 feet,\r\ngross tonnage 12,950 tons. The bulkheads are sixteen in number, and\r\nthey will enable the vessel to float with any two, or in some cases\r\nthree, of the compartments open to the sea. Although fitted with\r\ntwin screws, there is an aperture in the stern frame similar to that\r\nin a single screw steamer. This is provided that the propellers may\r\nwork freely, though they are fitted close to the centre line of the\r\nship, in order to prevent damage to or from the quay walls. In the\r\naccommodation for passengers all the latest improvements are to be\r\nfound, and everything calculated to render ocean travelling more\r\ncomfortable and enjoyable is introduced. The grand saloon, drawing\r\nroom, library and smoking rooms are noble in their proportions, and\r\nsuggest the stately chambers of a palace rather than accommodation\r\nwithin the steel walls of a ship. It is worthy of special notice\r\nthat comfort has been studied in every detail, and perhaps nothing\r\nexemplifies this more than the fact that in all the principal rooms\r\nthere are coal fire-grates, the first that have ever been used on\r\nboard ship. There are four sets of generating plant, capable of\r\nsupplying throughout the ship 1,350 16-candle power incandescent\r\nelectric light, and in addition a powerful searchlight, for\r\nfacilitating the navigation into port, &c. Wire to the length of 40\r\nmiles runs through the ship. The grand saloon is a magnificent hall\r\nin the modified Italian style, 100 feet long by 63 feet broad, with\r\nseats at table for 430 passengers. In the centre, a great crystal\r\ndome rises through the two decks above to a height of 33 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. ETRURIA. Cunard Steamship Company.]\r\n\r\nThree classes of passengers are carried by the CAMPANIA, viz., first,\r\nsecond and third class; and roughly speaking there is accommodation\r\nfor about 1,400 passengers and 400 crew. While the hulls of both\r\nvessels are almost unrivalled in size and in the accommodation they\r\nafford, the machinery by which they are propelled is almost unique in\r\nmagnitude and skill in construction. The two sets of triple-expansion\r\nengines in each ship develop the enormous amount of 30,000 I.H.P. The\r\nfunnels of the CAMPANIA and LUCANIA from their lowest section are 120\r\nfeet high, or about the height of the Eddystone Lighthouse, and their\r\ndiameter 20 feet.\r\n\r\nThe CAMPANIA has maintained an average speed for twelve months, on\r\nher eastward runs, of 21·88 knots per hour, while the LUCANIA for the\r\nsame period shows an average speed of 22·01 knots. The Mediterranean\r\nservice has within the last few years been greatly improved by the\r\naddition of four new steel steamships, each of about 3,000 tons\r\nburthen. These are the PAVIA (1897), TYRIA (1897), CYPRIA (1898)\r\nand VERIA (1899). The Boston service also comprises the following\r\nmodern steel twin-screw steamships:—IVERNIA and SAXONIA, built in\r\n1900, the ULTONIA in 1898, and the SYLVANIA in 1895. The IVERNIA and\r\nSAXONIA are practically alike, and call for some special notice. They\r\nare the largest ships carrying passengers and cargo to Boston. The\r\nprincipal dimensions of the ships are—Length 600 feet, beam 64 feet 3\r\ninches and depth 41 feet 6 inches. The gross tonnage is 14,027 tons,\r\nmeasurement capacity 20,000 tons, while the displacement is no less\r\nthan 25,000 tons. In their ordinary work across the Atlantic they\r\ncarry 200 first, 220 second, and about 1,900 third-class passengers.\r\nIf engaged in trooping, each ship could carry 200 officers and\r\n3,500 men, together with 10,000 tons of stores. The features of the\r\nships, next to their huge size, are the spaciousness and comfort of\r\ntheir passenger accommodation and their steadiness, which is most\r\nremarkable, and which makes sea sickness almost impossible. Aerial\r\ntelegraphy is in regular operation on board these two vessels. The\r\nCunard was the first steamship company to systematically adopt this\r\nlatest development of electrical science. It was in the LUCANIA\r\nthat Mr. Marconi’s system was first set up, and so pleased were the\r\nDirectors with the results that they at once decided to adopt the\r\ninvention in their other steamers, the CAMPANIA, LUCANIA, ETRURIA,\r\nUMBRIA, CARPATHIA, AURANIA, IVERNIA and SAXONIA all being now thus\r\nequipped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. LUCANIA. Cunard Steamship Co.]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1903, the LUCANIA was the medium selected by the inventor\r\nfor further experiments in wireless telegraphy, and on the voyage\r\nfrom New York to Liverpool completed on October 10th, Signor Marconi\r\nsuccessfully accomplished a wonderful feat, and a newspaper with\r\nreal news fresh from the Marconi stations at Cape Breton, Nova\r\nScotia, and Poldhu, Cornwall, was published every day. Messages were\r\ntransmitted over a distance of 2,000 miles as accurately as over the\r\nsame number of feet or yards, so that passengers on board the LUCANIA\r\nhad their printed newspaper, the “Cunard Bulletin,” every day of the\r\nvoyage, containing the most interesting events on both continents.\r\nJust before arrival in Liverpool a larger edition of the “Cunard\r\nBulletin,” a weekly issue, was printed giving an epitome of the news\r\nrecorded in the six daily publications during the voyage, and marking\r\na fresh era in oceanic journalism.\r\n\r\nThe CARPATHIA, the latest addition to the Cunard fleet, represents\r\na new departure in Atlantic trade, being designed exclusively for\r\nsecond and third-class passengers, all of whom are accommodated in\r\nrooms containing two and four berths. The dimensions of the CARPATHIA\r\nare—Length 560 feet, breadth 64 feet 3 inches, depth 40 feet 6\r\ninches, and the gross tonnage is 13,555 tons. She started on her\r\nmaiden voyage May 5th, 1903, and being built on similar lines to the\r\nIVERNIA and SAXONIA shares their reputation for remarkable steadiness\r\nat sea even in the stormiest weather.\r\n\r\nA recent item of interest in connection with this famous company is\r\nthe agreement made in August, 1903, with the British Government,\r\nby which the Cunard Company are to build two new steamers of an\r\naverage speed of not less than 24½ knots, which, along with all\r\nother Cunard ships, are to be at the disposal of the Admiralty for\r\nhire or purchase whenever they may be required. To help them in\r\nthis undertaking, such fast ships being unprofitable for commercial\r\npurposes, the Government lend the Company £2,600,000 to build the\r\nships, and grant them a subsidy of £150,000 a year.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1903, the Cunard Company started a new Winter Passenger\r\nService from New York to the Mediterranean ports, calling at\r\nGibraltar, Algiers, Naples, Palermo, Venice, Trieste and Fiume. The\r\nAURANIA and CARPATHIA, carrying only two classes of passengers,\r\nwere chosen for this new service, which opens up a round of most\r\ninteresting travel to the great travelling public of moderate means.\r\nPassengers by these steamers may land at any of the ports named and\r\nvisit at leisure places of interest in Spain, France, Italy, Germany,\r\nSicily, Austria or Hungary, continuing their journey overland to\r\nEngland to return to New York by Cunard steamer from Liverpool; or,\r\nif they prefer to do so, they may remain in the ship all the time\r\nand return in her to New York; or, as a third course, they may make\r\na stay in any of the countries named and rejoin a subsequent Cunard\r\nMediterranean ship at any of her calling ports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHOUSTON LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis well-known line of steamers was established about a quarter of\r\na century ago by the present senior partner of the firm, Mr. R. P.\r\nHouston, Member of Parliament for the Toxteth Division of Liverpool.\r\nLike many other undertakings which have grown to gigantic dimensions\r\nfrom small beginnings, this firm started in a modest manner with one\r\nsmall steamer. This was the steamer ATHLETE, followed in the year\r\n1881 by a larger steamer, the HERCULES, built by the Whitehaven Ship\r\nBuilding Co., and engined by Messrs. J. Jones & Sons, of Liverpool.\r\nShe was a vessel of 742 tons net register, and 1,155 tons gross\r\nregister, her principal dimensions being, length 212 feet, beam 34\r\nfeet and depth 16 feet 6 inches. Her engines, which were of 150\r\nnominal horse-power, were compound. These two vessels were not\r\nengaged in any regular trade, but ran wherever profitable freights\r\ncould be obtained, and chiefly to Java and Eastern ports. Becoming\r\ntoo small for Messrs. Houston’s requirements, they were sold. All the\r\nsucceeding vessels of the fleet, of which there have been a great\r\nmany, have been named after Greek mythological deities or Roman\r\ncelebrities, each name beginning with the letter “H.”\r\n\r\nAlthough already very busily engaged with large contracts for the\r\nconveyance of material to the Panama Canal Co., and the West African\r\nCo., Mr. Houston, believing there was ample room for a new line of\r\nsteamers to the River Plate from Liverpool, decided to enter upon\r\nthat trade in the year 1884. New steamers were designed and built\r\nspecially for this trade, and so energetically and successfully was\r\nthe trade worked that, although severe opposition was encountered\r\nat first from the existing lines, in a short time not only were\r\nMessrs. Houston’s steamers fully occupied, but many steamers had to\r\nbe chartered to meet the rapidly increasing traffic, since which time\r\nthe Houston Line has assumed very large proportions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYDASPES S.S. Houston Line.]\r\n\r\nThe first steamer engaged in this trade was the HERMES, built on the\r\nClyde in 1882, and engined by Messrs. J. Jones and Son, Liverpool.\r\nShe was a much larger vessel than the HERCULES, her gross register\r\nbeing 2,175 tons, and her principal dimensions 290 feet in length by\r\n40 feet beam and 22 feet depth.\r\n\r\nAfter a short interval more steamers, each of about 2,000 tons\r\ngross, were added to the fleet in 1884. These were the HELLENES,\r\nbuilt by Richardson, Duck & Co., and engined by G. Clark, of\r\nSunderland—length 270 feet, beam 40 feet, and depth 18 feet 7 inches;\r\nand the HESPERIDES, built by R. & J. Evans & Co., and engined by\r\nGeorge Forrester & Co., Liverpool—length 286 feet, beam 38 feet, and\r\ndepth 24 feet. The following year (1885) a larger boat than any yet\r\nbuilt for the firm was added to the fleet. This was the HELIADES,\r\nbuilt by Richardson, Duck & Co., Stockton. She was 320 feet long,\r\nand of proportionate beam and depth. Her gross register was about\r\n3,000 tons, and she was fitted with triple-expansion engines by T.\r\nRichardson & Co., of West Hartlepool, with which class of engines all\r\nthe succeeding steamers have been fitted. A sister ship, but having\r\nmore powerful engines, the HERACLIDES was launched for the firm in\r\nJuly, 1886. She was followed in 1889 by the HIPPOMENES, built at\r\nBelfast by Workman, Clark & Co., and the HYDARNES and the HELLOPES,\r\nbuilt at Port Glasgow by J. Reid & Co. These steamers, like their\r\nimmediate predecessors, were each of about 3,000 tons gross register,\r\nand were all practically of the same dimensions. The whole of these\r\nfour steamers are fitted with refrigerators for the carriage of\r\nfrozen meat from the River Plate.\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred S. Collard, a gentleman with a large and varied experience\r\nin the River Plate trade, and one thoroughly conversant with the\r\nworking and requirements of an important steamship line, joined Mr.\r\nHouston as partner in 1893.\r\n\r\nDuring the closing years of the last and beginning of the present\r\ncentury the quantity of railway rolling stock and plant for shipment\r\nto the River Plate was so great that it was not an uncommon event\r\nfor the Brunswick Station of the Cheshire Lines Railway to be almost\r\nentirely blocked with wagons of railway material consigned for\r\nshipment by the Houston Line. So large were some of these packages,\r\nthey could only be brought through from the manufacturers on Sunday,\r\nit being impossible to convey them on the railway while the ordinary\r\ntraffic was being carried on. In 1898 Messrs. Russell & Co., of Port\r\nGlasgow, built two sister ships of over 3,500 tons gross register for\r\nMessrs. Houston. These were the HERMINIUS and the HORATIUS.\r\n\r\nThe year 1899 was an important one in the firm’s history. In that\r\nyear the trade between New York and the River Plate was entered, and\r\nsince that time a regular service has been maintained, the pioneer\r\nsteamer being the HERMES (the second of that name). She was a steel\r\nbuilt steamer of 3,400 tons gross, driven by triple expansion engines\r\nof about 2,500 horse-power effective. She was launched at Sunderland\r\nin January, 1899, and is of the following dimensions:—Length 350 feet\r\n2 inches, beam 47 feet, depth 17 feet. She was the first of a fleet\r\nof seven similar vessels which were launched to the order of the\r\nfirm during the course of that year, the others being the HONORIUS,\r\nHORTENSIUS, HYADES, HYDASPES, HYLAS, and the HYANTHES.\r\n\r\nThe following year, the last of the 19th century, saw one more\r\nsteamer, the HOSTILIUS, added to the Line.\r\n\r\nFrequent as were the additions to the Houston Fleet, they were not\r\nsufficient to keep pace with the expanding trade, which increased\r\nso rapidly that many outside steamers had to be chartered. When\r\nex-President Kruger sent his fateful ultimatum to the British\r\nGovernment, which resulted in the South African War, Messrs. Houston\r\n& Co. were amongst the first to offer their steamers to the\r\nAdmiralty for the conveyance of troops, horses, mules, fodder, &c. It\r\nwas of the greatest importance that ships should be fitted up for the\r\ntransit of troops and animals for transport purposes as quickly as\r\npossible, and this was carried out by the Houston Line with eminent\r\nsatisfaction to H.M. Government. The principals and the staff worked\r\nnight and day, and spared no efforts in despatching quickly the men,\r\nhorses and stores so urgently required at the seat of war. Large\r\nnumbers of horses, mules and stores were carried by the Houston\r\nsteamers from the United Kingdom, the Continent and the United States\r\nto the various South African ports with a gratifying immunity from\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated here that the senior partner of the firm is an\r\nexpert engineer, and that all the steamers built for his firm, and\r\nwhich have been so remarkably successful, have been built from\r\nspecifications and designs drawn up by him.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, many of the steamers are fitted with\r\nrefrigerating machinery for the conveyance of frozen meat, and are\r\nregularly employed in this trade. These steamers are favourably known\r\nfor the excellent condition in which they deliver their cargoes,\r\nand in order that the live stock should be landed in the very best\r\npossible condition, the steamers were fitted up with permanent cattle\r\nfittings, and made in every way suitable for successfully carrying\r\nlive stock.\r\n\r\nThe Houston Line River Plate steamers take cargo from Glasgow,\r\nLiverpool and New York for Monte Video, Buenos Ayres, Rosario, &c.,\r\nwithout transhipment, which is a very important matter in the opinion\r\nof shippers.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that a very serious fight is\r\nbeing waged (1903) in the South African shipping trade, owing to\r\nthe entrance therein of the Houston Line. In July, 1902, sailings\r\nfrom Glasgow, Middlesbrough, Bristol, Liverpool and London (as well\r\nas from New York) to Cape Town, Algoa Bay, East London, Durban and\r\nDelagoa Bay were announced by the Messrs. Houston. The Steamship\r\nLines then engaged in the trade had formed a Conference or “ring.”\r\nThe members of this “ring” are the Union-Castle Line, the Clan Line,\r\nthe Bucknall Line, the Harrison-Ellerman Line, J. T. Rennie & Co.,\r\nand Bullard, King & Co., forming the strongest shipping ring ever\r\nknown. It is this shipping “ring” that the Houston Line is opposing.\r\n\r\nGreat public interest in the struggle has been excited by the many\r\nangry and strongly worded letters from shippers which have been\r\npublished from time to time in the current Press regarding the _modus\r\noperandi_ of the “ring.” Tactics of such a character have been\r\nadopted by the “ring” as will, we understand, form a subject of an\r\naction in the Courts of Law, as they have already provoked discussion\r\nand protest in various Chambers of Commerce, and have even been\r\ndiscussed in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nFrom present appearances the Houston Line is growing steadily in\r\nfavour of shippers to the Cape ports, and having now been in the\r\ntrade for over twelve months it must have secured a firm foothold.\r\nCertainly shippers and merchants generally welcome and support this\r\n“Line” as having a beneficial influence upon the trade between this\r\ncountry and our South African Colonies.\r\n\r\nThe latest built and largest steamers of the fleet are engaged in the\r\nCape service. Amongst them are HYACINTHUS, HALIZONES, HYDASPES and\r\nHYPATIA, with an average dead weight carrying capacity of about 9,000\r\ntons each.\r\n\r\nWe understand several large carrying steamers are in course of\r\nconstruction for the firm.\r\n\r\nAs showing the great increase in the size of the firm’s vessels, it\r\nmay be interesting to compare the dimensions of one of the earliest\r\nand of one of the latest built ships.\r\n\r\nThe HERCULES was 212 feet long, 34 feet broad and 16 feet 6 inches\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nThe HYPATIA is 452 feet long, 52 feet 2 inches broad, and 28 feet 3\r\ninches deep.\r\n\r\nThe gross registered tonnage of the former was 1,155 tons, while that\r\nof the latter is over 5,600 tons.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the Houston Line has been a remarkably rapid one, and\r\nshows what ability and energy combined can do.\r\n\r\nThe fleet now consists of 25 steamers of a gross registered tonnage\r\nof over 90,000 tons, and with a dead weight carrying capacity of over\r\n130,000 tons.\r\n\r\n  HOUSTON LINE STEAMERS.\r\n\r\n  HALIZONES.\r\n  HARMODIUS.\r\n  HARMONIDES.\r\n  HELIADES.\r\n  HELIOS.\r\n  HELLENES.\r\n  HELLOPES.\r\n  HERACLIDES.\r\n  HERMINIUS.\r\n  HERMIONE.\r\n  HESIONE.\r\n  HESPERIDES.\r\n  HILARIUS.\r\n  HIPPOMENES.\r\n  HONORIUS.\r\n  HORATIUS.\r\n  HORTENSIUS.\r\n  HOSTILIUS.\r\n  HYACINTHUS.\r\n  HYADES.\r\n  HYANTHES.\r\n  HYDASPES.\r\n  HYLAS.\r\n  HYPATIA.\r\n  HYPERIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lighthouse]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSWESTRY GRANGE. Houlder Bros. & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nHOULDER LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Company was founded by the late Mr. Edwin Savory Houlder in\r\nLondon in 1849, and he was subsequently joined by his brothers\r\nMessrs. Alfred and Augustus Houlder. At first the business was\r\nconfined to sailing-ships, a fleet of Clipper Packets sailing\r\nunder the firm’s flag between the home ports and Australia being\r\nestablished. As the business increased, the firm became in turn\r\ninterested in the South African and South American Trades, the\r\ndevelopment of their steam fleet receiving a large amount of\r\nattention, until, at the present time, it includes some of the\r\nlargest and most successful frozen meat carriers afloat.\r\n\r\nThe principal services now maintained are between the United Kingdom\r\nand South America, between South America and the Cape ports, between\r\nAustralia and New Zealand and the Cape ports, and from New York to\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, although many other trades of the world\r\nclaim the Company’s attention and for these trades a large amount of\r\ntonnage is chartered annually.\r\n\r\nThe Headquarters are in London, with Branches at Liverpool, Glasgow,\r\nSydney, N.S.W., Cape Town and Buenos Aires; also sub-offices at\r\nRosario and La Plata.\r\n\r\nWith one exception, the steamers of the Fleet are distinguished\r\nby the affix GRANGE. The first were the HORNBY GRANGE (3,750 tons\r\nburthen) and OVINGDEAN GRANGE (3,520 tons burthen), launched in the\r\nopening months of 1890, both vessels being insulated throughout for\r\ncarrying frozen meat, as are all the other steamers of the Line. They\r\nwere followed in 1894 by the URMSTON GRANGE, designed to carry 5,420\r\ntons. In 1896 two important additions were made in the shape of the\r\nsteamers LANGTON GRANGE and DENTON GRANGE, each having a deadweight\r\ncapacity of 9,200 tons, and like the earlier steamers insulated in\r\nthe most efficient manner for carrying frozen meat. In the meantime\r\ntwo more steamers were acquired, the ELSTREE GRANGE and the SOUTHERN\r\nCROSS, the latter being placed in the Australian trade in company\r\nwith the LANGTON GRANGE and DENTON GRANGE, whilst the former was\r\ntaken into the River Plate service which had grown to such an extent\r\nas to justify the addition of two further vessels, larger and faster\r\nthan any of the earlier ships in the trade. These were the ROYSTON\r\nGRANGE and BEACON GRANGE, each 6,400 tons burthen, and capable of\r\nmaking the passage between England and the River Plate in twenty-two\r\nor twenty-three days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEACON GRANGE. Houlder Bros. & Co.]\r\n\r\nFor the Australian trade the RIPPINGHAM GRANGE, a sister ship to the\r\nLANGTON GRANGE, was added in 1898.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, the various steamers comprising the fleet were\r\namalgamated into one Company under the name of the Houlder Line,\r\nLimited, this step being taken in order to consolidate the business\r\ngenerally, and to ensure more systematic and economical working.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this, however, the firm of Houlder Bros. & Co. was\r\nconverted into a Limited Company, the partners in the old firm\r\nbecoming Managing Directors of the new Company, Mr. Edwin Savory\r\nHoulder acting as Chairman until his death in 1901.\r\n\r\nTo return to our description of the fleet. To replace the DENTON\r\nGRANGE (unfortunately lost at Las Palmas) the Company contracted for\r\nthe DRAYTON GRANGE, a fine four-masted, twin-screw steamer of 10,000\r\ntons burthen, launched in December, 1901, and also for a sister ship,\r\nthe OSWESTRY GRANGE, launched a few months later. Both of these\r\nsteamers, and, in fact, the other large vessels of the fleet, did\r\nexcellent service during the South African War.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORNBY GRANGE. Houlder Bros. & Co.]\r\n\r\nThe fleet, at the present time, consists of fourteen steamers, three\r\nboats having been added since the launch of the OSWESTRY GRANGE, as\r\nthe following list will show:—\r\n\r\n                    TONS BURTHEN.\r\n   Hornby Grange        3,750\r\n   Ovingdean Grange     3,520\r\n   Urmston Grange       5,420\r\n   Langton Grange       9,200\r\n  *Drayton Grange      10,000\r\n   Elstree Grange       6,000\r\n   Royston Grange       6,400\r\n   Beacon Grange        6,400\r\n   Rippingham Grange    9,200\r\n  *Oswestry Grange     10,000\r\n   Thorpe Grange        6,350\r\n   Haversham Grange    11,200\r\n  *Everton Grange      11,000\r\n   Southern Cross       7,300\r\n        * Twin screw.\r\n\r\ngiving a total of 105,740 tons.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare the smallest vessel, the OVINGDEAN\r\nGRANGE, with the largest and most recent, the EVERTON GRANGE, the\r\ndifference being not only in the increased size but also in the great\r\nimprovements in the propelling machinery, refrigerating machinery,\r\npassenger accommodation, appliances for handling cargo and other\r\npoints too numerous to mention in detail:—\r\n\r\n   LENGTH.   BEAM.    DEPTH.         TONS.\r\n  OVINGDEAN GRANGE   309 ft.   40 ft.   21 ft. 4 in.    3,520\r\n  EVERTON GRANGE     490 ft.   56 ft.   35 ft. 6 in.   11,000\r\n\r\nSpecial provision has been made for the Company’s passenger service,\r\nthe boats being provided with every requisite to make a long sea\r\nvoyage as comfortable as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New Brighton Lighthouse River Mersey]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROSE S.S. 1363 Tons. Messrs. Alex. A. Laird & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nLAIRD LINE.\r\n\r\nTHE GLASGOW, DUBLIN, AND LONDONDERRY STEAM PACKET CO., LTD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis important company, which claims (on very strong evidence) to be\r\nthe oldest steamship company in the world, was originated in 1814—two\r\nyears after the launch of Bell’s COMET—by Mr. Lewis MacLellan and\r\nothers. Its history is a most varied one, the several firms of Alex.\r\nA. Laird & Sons, Thos. Cameron & Co., and MacConnell & Laird, having\r\nbecome unified during its existence of nearly a century into the one\r\nlarge concern known throughout the kingdom as the “Laird Line.”\r\n\r\nIt has been the great pioneer of the steamship trade of the Clyde,\r\nnot merely by reason of its long standing, but also because of the\r\nvaried and extensive sphere of its operations.\r\n\r\nThe first steamer owned by the founder of the company was the\r\nBRITANNIA, a small paddle-wheel steampacket, built, like all the\r\nvessels of her time, of wood.\r\n\r\nThe second steampacket was the WATERLOO, built in 1816. A reference\r\nis made to both these steamers in the sixth chapter of the first\r\npart of this volume. They plied between the Bromielaw (Glasgow) and\r\nGreenock, Gourock, Rothesay, Tarbert, Lochgilphead, and Inverary.\r\nEven in these early days of steam navigation, it was the avowed\r\npolicy of the manager of these steampackets to make all things\r\nsubordinate to safety, and, in accordance with this policy, the\r\nmasters of the steamers were instructed “not to contend with other\r\nboats so as to endanger the vessels, or alarm the passengers,” This\r\nsound policy, which has been continued by Mr. MacLellan’s successors\r\nto the present day, has, in large measure, contributed to the\r\npopularity and success of the firm.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that over eighty years ago passenger season\r\ntickets were in force on the steampackets of this company. Those who\r\nare desirous of verifying this statement can do so by referring to\r\nthe “Glasgow Chronicle” of the 23rd May, 1816, in which they will\r\nfind the following advertisement:—\r\n\r\n  “The steampackets, BRITANNIA and WATERLOO, sail regularly from the\r\n  Bromielaw to all the watering-places on both sides of the Clyde.\r\n  Families wishing to agree for the season will learn the terms\r\n  by applying to the masters on board, or to Mr. Lewis MacLellan,\r\n  Gallowgate.”\r\n\r\nThe BRITANNIA, in the year referred to, opened up for the first time,\r\nsteam communication between Glasgow and Campbeltown, and in the early\r\nsummer of 1820, she made her first trip from Glasgow to the Giant’s\r\nCauseway.\r\n\r\nShe was commanded on that voyage by Captain Wyse, whose death in 1851\r\nwas the occasion of the following paragraph, which appeared in the\r\n“Glasgow Chronicle”:—\r\n\r\n  “Captain Wyse (whose decease we announce) was the first to carry\r\n  his steamer, the BRITANNIA, on a pleasure trip from the Clyde to\r\n  the Giant’s Causeway, with an illustrious and distinguished party.\r\n  The astonished inhabitants in thousands crowded the hills and\r\n  promontories, all along the shores of Antrim, to see a ship with a\r\n  smoking funnel, and a band of music on board, sailing against wind\r\n  and tide. Out of this pleasure trip sprung up the present lucrative\r\n  trade between the ports of the Clyde and the North of Ireland,\r\n  from which great advantages have unquestionably arisen to the\r\n  inhabitants of both kingdoms.”\r\n\r\nAs time advanced, the river traffic was discontinued by the Company,\r\nand the cross-channel trade developed. After running excursions to\r\nthe Giant’s Causeway for two seasons, the BRITANNIA was placed on the\r\nGlasgow and Londonderry station, sailing from each port once a week.\r\n\r\nMr. Alex. A. Laird (after whom the line is named) was a well-known\r\nshipbroker in Greenock at the beginning of the last century, and\r\nwhen the famous St. George Steam Packet Company commenced operations\r\nin 1822, the first steamship service it established was between\r\nLiverpool and Greenock, and Mr. Laird was appointed agent for the\r\nCompany at the latter port.\r\n\r\nThe St. George Company did not continue for any length of time its\r\ndirect service between the Clyde and the Mersey, but in the following\r\nyear (1823) a new steam packet company was formed, to trade only\r\nbetween Liverpool, Greenock and Glasgow, calling at Douglas (Isle of\r\nMan) and Portpatrick. Mr. Laird was the manager of the new company,\r\nand opened a branch office at 25, York Street, Glasgow, under the\r\nstyle of Alex. Laird & Co.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer steamer of the new service was the HENRY BELL, built by\r\nMr. Thomas Wilson, a celebrated Liverpool shipbuilder, in 1823. She\r\nwas considered a very smart craft in those days, was fitted with\r\ntwo engines of 30 horse power each, and carried about 120 tons all\r\ntold, on a draft of about 8 feet. She continued on the Glasgow and\r\nLiverpool station until 1831, when she was purchased by Messrs. James\r\nLittle & Co., for their Glasgow and Newry trade.\r\n\r\nThe original intention of the proprietors was that the HENRY\r\nBELL should sail to and from Glasgow, but it was found there was\r\nnot sufficient water in the Clyde to enable this to be done with\r\nregularity, and Greenock was, consequently, made the port of arrival\r\nand departure. The deck fare by this steamer was 6s. per passenger,\r\nthe steerage fare by the mail packets (MAJESTIC and CITY OF GLASGOW)\r\nbeing 21s.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Alex. A. Laird commenced his apprenticeship under his\r\nfather in 1824, and the same year a second vessel, the JAMES WATT,\r\nwas placed on the Glasgow and Liverpool station. She was slightly\r\nlarger, and had engines of greater power than the HENRY BELL.\r\n\r\nThe following year Messrs. Laird established a fortnightly service\r\nbetween Glasgow and Inverness; the steampacket employed was the\r\nSTIRLING, which made her first voyage on the 11th May, 1825, and\r\ncontinued to sail thereafter on alternate Wednesdays from Glasgow\r\nand Inverness. Fortnightly sailings proving insufficient for the\r\ntraffic, the sailings were increased to weekly on and from the 20th\r\nSeptember, 1826.\r\n\r\nDuring this year the WILLIAM HUSKISSON was added to the Liverpool and\r\nGlasgow service, and sailings were maintained three times per week\r\nfrom each port.\r\n\r\nThe WILLIAM HUSKISSON was a very much larger vessel than either of\r\nher predecessors, her deadweight capacity being 350 tons, and her\r\nengines 120 horse power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The late Mr. ALEX. A. LAIRD.]\r\n\r\nFor the Campbeltown and Londonderry trade the steampackets CLYDESDALE\r\nand LONDONDERRY were built, and were advertised to sail from Glasgow\r\nto both ports, with goods and passengers, every Tuesday, Thursday\r\nand Saturday. In addition to these sailings, the MAID OF ISLAY was\r\ndespatched every Tuesday morning from the Bromielaw to Stranraer and\r\nIslay. Messrs. Laird’s connection with Dublin dates also from this\r\nyear, the pioneer steamer being the TOWN OF DROGHEDA, which sailed on\r\nher first voyage from Greenock to Dublin on Monday, 7th June, 1826.\r\nThe new steampacket SOLWAY was added to the Liverpool and Greenock\r\nfleet in 1828, and the sailings increased to four per week from each\r\nport. The steampacket CLARENCE acted as tender, and sailed from the\r\nBromielaw at noon on the sailing dates of the Liverpool steampackets\r\nfrom Greenock.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 the firm extended its operations to Newry, the steamers\r\nemployed being the ERIN and ST. DAVID. Mr. James Bruce was admitted\r\na partner in the Glasgow house this year, and the office was removed\r\nto 69, Oswald Street, where the business was conducted under the\r\nstyle of Laird & Bruce. This partnership was dissolved on the 14th\r\nFebruary, 1835; Mr. Bruce retaining the Stranraer trade. The title of\r\nMr. Laird’s firm was changed to Alex. Laird & Sons, and the Glasgow\r\noffice removed to Ewing Place, corner of York Street.\r\n\r\nOne of the steamers, for which Mr. Laird was agent, was named the\r\nCUMBERLAND. This vessel took an active part in the Spanish Expedition\r\nof 1835, as a transport, making three voyages to Spain during this\r\nyear, with recruits from the West of Scotland for the service of\r\nDonna Isabella. Some of these recruits enlisted in the course of\r\ndrunken frolics, or after quarrels with their friends or masters, and\r\ntheir military ardour speedily cooled. The period during which they\r\nhad to wait on the receiving ship at Greenock until the transport was\r\nready to receive them afforded frequent opportunities of deserting,\r\nof which they did not fail to avail themselves. Scarcely a day passed\r\nbut some of them succeeded in escaping by means of the boats which\r\nvisited the receiving ships in the evenings. One youth from Glasgow,\r\nfailing to get away in this manner, determined to drop into the sea\r\nand swim ashore, a distance of about two miles, to a spit where\r\nfemale friends would be waiting to assist him. He had nearly reached\r\nthe shore when he was discovered, and pursued by the guard boat.\r\nMaking a final effort, he succeeded in landing, and, though fatigued\r\nwith his long swim, continued his flight.\r\n\r\nWhen the guard boat’s crew landed, the women got round them, and so\r\nhampered them in their movements that the fugitive got out of sight,\r\nwhen, of course, it was useless to attempt to follow him.\r\n\r\nThe CUMBERLAND, after performing the three voyages referred to,\r\nreturned to her station between Glasgow and Dublin.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Messrs. Laird & Sons (then at 101, Union Street) were\r\nappointed agents at Glasgow for the Dundalk Steam Packet Co., the\r\nfirst steamer from Glasgow, the FINN MACCOUL, sailing on the 30th\r\nNovember, 1844.\r\n\r\nFor a period of forty years, from 1827 to 1867, Messrs. T. Cameron &\r\nCo. had maintained steamship services between Glasgow and Greenock,\r\nand ports on the North and West coasts of Ireland, and from 1843\r\nuntil 1867 a weekly service between Liverpool and Sligo. In 1867 the\r\nGlasgow services were conducted by the joint firms of Messrs. T.\r\nCameron & Co. and Alex. A. Laird & Co., but the following year, owing\r\nto the decease of Mr. Cameron, the business was entirely taken over\r\nby Messrs. Laird.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Cameron’s steamers were named after flowers and plants (with\r\ntwo exceptions, referred to later), the first steamer of this class\r\nbeing the SHAMROCK, built in 1847, followed by the THISTLE in 1848,\r\nROSE in 1851, MYRTLE in 1854, and the GARLAND in 1857.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the change of firm, Messrs. Cameron & Co. had been\r\nopposed on the Glasgow and Sligo and Liverpool and Sligo stations,\r\nfor ten years, by a local company, the Sligo Steam Navigation Co.\r\nThis was subsequently settled amicably, Messrs. Alex. A. Laird &\r\nCo. retired from the Liverpool and Sligo trade, and the Sligo Steam\r\nNavigation Co. withdrew from the Glasgow trade, and having purchased\r\nthe opposition steamer GARLAND, renamed her the GLASGOW.\r\n\r\nThe two exceptions in class of name, to which reference has been\r\nmade, were the NORTHMAN and IRISHMAN, trading as the Glasgow and\r\nDublin Screw Steam Packet Co. They were amongst the earliest iron\r\nscrew steamers built, the former having been launched in 1847 and the\r\nlatter in 1854. These two steamers retained the colour of the old\r\nSt. George Co. on the funnel, viz., a white funnel with a black top.\r\nThe IRISHMAN was the last steamer so distinguished, all succeeding\r\nsteamers carrying what is now the recognised “Laird” funnel—white and\r\nred in equal proportions, with a black top.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, to meet the requirements of the West Coast of Ireland\r\ntrade, the Company purchased the steamer SCOTIA, and renamed her the\r\nLAUREL. Two steamers were added to the fleet in 1878. These were the\r\nsteamships AZALEA and CEDAR. These ships are identical in measurement\r\nand capacity, each being 217 feet long, 30 feet broad, and 15 feet\r\ndeep, with a gross register of 750 tons, and with excellent saloon\r\naccommodation for seventy passengers.\r\n\r\nAn important addition was made to the fleet in 1879, when\r\nthe magnificent and fast steamship SHAMROCK was built. She\r\nwas considerably in advance in point of capacity, speed, and\r\naccommodation of any steamer previously built for the firm. She\r\nmeasures 231 feet 2 inches in length, 31 feet 3 inches in breadth,\r\nand 15 feet 5 inches in depth; and her gross register is 864 tons.\r\nShe is certified to carry eighty saloon passengers, and is equipped\r\nwith every modern convenience for their comfort.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of three years (1882) the BRIER was built, a\r\nsomewhat similar vessel, but slightly smaller than the preceding\r\nsteamer, her dimensions being 209 feet by 30 feet by 15 feet.\r\nHer gross register is 728 tons, and she has berthing and saloon\r\naccommodation for sixty passengers. She was quickly followed by the\r\nTHISTLE and ELM, both built in 1884, and the GARDENIA in 1885. They\r\nare all beautiful specimens of marine architecture, the first a large\r\nsteamer of 822 tons gross register, and the latter considerably\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 a further advance was made in the size of the Company’s ships\r\nby the construction of the splendid screw steamer OLIVE, 1,141 tons\r\ngross register, one of the fastest and finest steamers crossing the\r\nchannel. She is 260 feet long, with a beam of 33 feet 1 inch, and a\r\ndepth of 15 feet 8 inches. She has always been a particular favourite\r\nwith passengers, of whom she carries a large number, being certified\r\nto carry one hundred saloon passengers, in addition to 1,000\r\nsteerage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVE S.S. 1141 Tons. Messrs. Alex. A. Laird & Co.]\r\n\r\nThe DAISY and the LILY were the next steamers built, the former\r\nin 1895, and the latter in 1896; and in the closing year of the\r\nnineteenth century the FERN (second of the name) was launched.\r\n\r\nThe latest addition to the fleet is a magnificent vessel constructed\r\nafter the most modern type of passenger steamships. She is named\r\nthe ROSE, was launched in June, 1902, is built of steel, and is 250\r\nfeet long, 36 feet 2 inches broad, and 15 feet deep. She is fitted\r\nwith electric light in the saloon, staterooms and holds. Her saloon,\r\nwhich is a handsomely furnished and spacious apartment, is situated\r\namidships forward of the engine room. The great breadth of the vessel\r\nmakes her a remarkably steady sea boat, while her engines, which are\r\ntriple-expansion and of great power, are capable of propelling her at\r\nthe rate of 15½ knots per hour. She is nearly 1,400 tons gross, and\r\ncarries 140 saloon passengers, in addition to those in the steerage.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 it was considered desirable to consolidate the several\r\ninterests concerned, by forming this old-established business into a\r\nlimited company, the title of the Company being The Glasgow, Dublin\r\nand Londonderry Steam Packet Co., Limited; but it is much better\r\nknown by the short name of the “Laird Line.” Mr. William MacConnell,\r\nson of the late Mr. MacConnell, of the firm of Thomson & MacConnell,\r\nis the Managing Director.\r\n\r\nThe company’s steamship services are not confined to those to and\r\nfrom Glasgow, although we have shown that they have a very large\r\nshare of the Clyde traffic, maintaining regular and frequent sailings\r\nbetween Glasgow and Greenock and Dublin, Londonderry, Coleraine,\r\nSligo, Ballina and Westport; also during the tourist season a daily\r\ndaylight service between Ardrossan and Portrush.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Midland Railway Company of England a service\r\nof powerful steamers is maintained between Morecambe and Dublin, the\r\nsteamers sailing from the respective ports on alternate days, and\r\nmaking the passage in about 10 hours.\r\n\r\nEarly next year, it is proposed to transfer the service from\r\nMorecambe to Heysham, and to maintain daily sailings to and from the\r\nlatter port and Dublin.\r\n\r\nThe “Laird” steamers also sail in connection with the same railway\r\ncompany from Morecambe to Londonderry every Tuesday and Saturday,\r\nreturning from Londonderry every Monday and Thursday.\r\n\r\nFrom Fleetwood, in connection with the Lancashire and Yorkshire, and\r\nLondon and North-Western Railway Companies, a weekly service had been\r\nmaintained for many years by the company’s steamers between Fleetwood\r\nand Londonderry, but in September, 1903, Messrs. Laird & Co. retired\r\nfrom this service.\r\n\r\nFrom Liverpool also, steam communication is maintained with Larne,\r\nColeraine and Westport. The fixed sailings are once a week from each\r\nport, but extra steamers are despatched according to the requirements\r\nof the trade.\r\n\r\nThe company’s fleet at the present date (1903) consists of 12\r\nfirst-class powerful steamships, having an aggregate gross tonnage of\r\n9,164 tons, and named as follows:—\r\n\r\n       Gross Tonnage.\r\n  AZALEA     748\r\n  BRIER      728\r\n  CEDAR      750\r\n  DAISY      565\r\n  ELM        521\r\n  FERN       503\r\n  GARDENIA   491\r\n  LILY       668\r\n  OLIVE     1141\r\n  ROSE      1363\r\n  SHAMROCK   864\r\n  THISTLE    822\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steamship]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nLANGLANDS’ LINE.\r\n\r\nGlasgow AND Liverpool Royal STEAMPACKET Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to the year 1839 all the steampackets plying between Liverpool\r\nand Glasgow were built of wood, and these wooden steamers had\r\nestablished for themselves a reputation for speed and luxurious\r\ntravelling not surpassed nearly three-quarters of a century later.\r\nIt was, therefore, a bold thing to do on the part of the proprietors\r\nof the Glasgow and Liverpool Royal Steampacket Company to enter into\r\ncompetition with these famous and tried vessels, and to introduce\r\ninto the trade steamers constructed not of wood but of iron. The\r\npioneer steamer of this company, the ROYAL SOVEREIGN, sailed on\r\nher maiden voyage from Liverpool on Monday, 18th March, 1839. The\r\ncompany despatched their steamer twice a week from each port, and\r\ncontinued to do so until the end of August of the same year, when\r\nthe second steamer, the ROYAL GEORGE, was placed on the station,\r\nand the sailings were increased to four times per week each way.\r\nThe established lines were naturally indisposed to share the trade\r\nwith an outsider, and to discourage the new enterprise they reduced\r\nthe rates of freight on fine goods to 1d. per foot, and on steerage\r\npassengers to 1s. each. The Royal Steampacket Company maintained,\r\nin spite of this endeavour to drive them out of the trade, their\r\nadvertised sailings, and grew in popularity with the travelling\r\npublic. They decided in 1841 to increase their fleet by the addition\r\nof a third steamer, and it being evident that they had come to stay,\r\ntheir competitors, Messrs. MacIver and Messrs. Burns, entered into a\r\nfriendly and honourable alliance with them, and uniform rates were\r\nadopted by the three lines to Glasgow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCESS MAUD. M. Langlands & Sons.]\r\n\r\nA tradition exists in the Royal Company that when their third\r\nsteamer was on the stocks the first birth in her late Majesty’s\r\nfamily was anticipated, and the proprietors proposed to call their\r\nnew steamer the PRINCE OF WALES. The event, however, proved the\r\nname to be inappropriate, and PRINCESS ROYAL was substituted, a\r\nname which has been perpetuated by different steamships to the\r\npresent day. The following paragraph respecting this steamer, which\r\nappeared in the “Glasgow Chronicle” of the 1st June, 1842, will be\r\nread with interest:—“The PRINCESS ROYAL. We feel much indebted to\r\nthe agent (Mr. M. Langlands) of this splendid steamer for putting\r\nus in possession of the ‘Morning Chronicle’ of yesterday morning\r\nthree hours before the arrival of the ‘London Mail’ containing the\r\ndetails of the attempted assassination of Her Majesty. Copies of the\r\n‘Chronicle,’ ‘Times,’ and other London journals were, the moment\r\nthe train arrived from Greenock, forwarded to the different public\r\nreading rooms in town, and altogether the public are much indebted\r\nto the proprietors and agents of the vessel at Liverpool and Glasgow\r\nfor their public spirit and enterprise. The passage from Liverpool to\r\nGreenock was made in the astonishing space of 16½ hours.”\r\n\r\nThe PRINCESS ROYAL referred to was built by the eminent firm of\r\nTod and M’Gregor, who in 1849 projected a line of steamers to run\r\nbetween Glasgow and New York. Accordingly they built and equipped\r\nthe barque-rigged screw steamer CITY OF GLASGOW, and appointed Mr.\r\nM. Langlands agent. She was a vessel of 1,087 tons register, with\r\nengines of 350 horse-power, and was manned by about 70 of a crew.\r\nIn the Art Palace at Kelvingrove, Glasgow, there is a watercolour\r\ndrawing (No. 2,018, by S. Bough) representing the departure of\r\nthis the first steamship for New York from Glasgow harbour, in\r\nApril, 1850. After making several very successful voyages, Tod and\r\nM’Gregor sold her to Richardson Bros., of Belfast, who ran her in the\r\nLiverpool and Philadelphia trade, and this vessel and the steamship\r\nCITY OF MANCHESTER were the nucleus of what became afterwards the\r\nwell-known Inman line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paddle Steampacket PRINCESS ROYAL. M. Langlands &\r\nSons.]\r\n\r\nIn view of the high reputation the PRINCESS ROYAL had earned, it is\r\nnot surprising that she was selected for experimental purposes by a\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons (appointed in 1842) for the purpose\r\nof inquiring into the conveyance of the mails between England and\r\nIreland. From the “Liverpool Mercury” of that date we learn that “The\r\nfine new iron steamboat called PRINCESS ROYAL, at present on the\r\nstation between this port and Glasgow, started from Clarence Dock on\r\nSunday morning last (19th June) for Dublin. She arrived there in 9\r\nhours 5 minutes, beating H.M. mail steampacket MEDUSA by 1 hour 45\r\nminutes. On Monday morning she left Dublin for Holyhead, and arrived\r\nthere in 4 hours 45 minutes, returning to Dublin the same day in 4\r\nhours 28 minutes. In the evening she started for Liverpool, which she\r\nreached in 9 hours 35 minutes. The vessel had a head wind nearly all\r\nthe way.”\r\n\r\nThe PRINCESS had now established beyond dispute her claim to be one\r\nof the fastest Channel steamers leaving the port. The ensuing winter\r\nshe proved herself to be also one of the best sea-boats. The terrible\r\ngale of January 20th to 22nd, 1843, was one of the most severe\r\nthat ever visited these coasts. The MONA’S ISLE, from Liverpool\r\nto Douglas, was 24 hours on the passage. At Cork the posts on the\r\nquays were carried away. The PRINCESS was at sea during this storm,\r\nand fully proved her excellent qualities as a sea-boat. She left\r\nGreenock at 11-30 p.m. on Friday, and arrived at Liverpool at 5 p.m.\r\non Saturday without the slightest damage. This celebrated steamer was\r\nreplaced in 1856 by a second PRINCESS ROYAL, also a paddle steamer.\r\nAfter running in the Liverpool and Glasgow service for about four\r\nyears, PRINCESS No. 2 was sold to the General Steam Navigation\r\nCompany, of London.\r\n\r\nThe third PRINCESS ROYAL, built in 1861, was a screw steamer, the\r\nfirst screw owned by the Glasgow and Liverpool Royal Steampacket\r\nCompany. In 1861, civil war broke out in the United States. The\r\nFederals (Northerners) established a strict blockade of all the\r\nSouthern ports on the Atlantic seaboard. A cotton famine ensued, and\r\nfast steamers were in great demand for blockade running. Amongst\r\nother Liverpool steamers purchased for this purpose was the new\r\nPRINCESS. She was sold in 1862, and her new owners changed her\r\nname. We are informed that she was captured on her first trip as a\r\nConfederate blockade runner, and converted by her captors into a\r\nFederal cruiser. Her immediate successor, the fourth PRINCESS ROYAL,\r\nafter running for a number of years between Liverpool and Glasgow,\r\nwas sold to a firm to trade in the West Indies. For the present the\r\nRoyal Steampacket Company is without a PRINCESS ROYAL, the fifth\r\nsteamer of that name having been sold in 1901 to foreign buyers.\r\nThe service is meantime maintained by the PRINCESS LOUISE, or other\r\nsteamer of the fleet.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1870, the Royal Company opened up a new steamship\r\nservice from Liverpool to the West Highlands, North of Scotland,\r\nand east coast ports. Owing, in large measure, to the natural\r\nattractions of the route, and the excellence of the accommodation and\r\ncuisine provided on the steamers, this is every year becoming a more\r\npopular and favourite trip. The first steamer employed on the West\r\nHighland and east coast route was a small cargo steamer, but in a\r\nvery short time it was found necessary to place the PRINCESS ALICE,\r\na much larger steamer, carrying passengers as well as cargo, on the\r\nroute. The earlier vessels on this service were steamers of 300 to\r\n400 tons, with limited accommodation for about 20 passengers, but\r\nnow the steamers employed have accommodation for 100 to 140 saloon\r\npassengers, and an average cargo-carrying capacity of nearly 1,000\r\ntons each. Some idea may be gained of the growth of the passenger and\r\ncargo traffic, by comparing the earlier vessels with the new PRINCESS\r\nMAUD, built in 1901. This steamer is of steel, and her dimensions\r\nare:—Length, 256 feet 6 inches; breadth, 36 feet 6 inches; depth, 17\r\nfeet 1½ inches. Gross tonnage, 1,450 tons. The vessel is handsomely\r\nfitted up for passengers, the large dining saloon being furnished in\r\nsolid oak, artistically carved. One hundred first-class passengers\r\ncan dine at one sitting, and there is sleeping accommodation in deck\r\nrooms and state cabins for 140 passengers. The steamer is fitted\r\nthroughout with electric light, patent berths, sea-water baths,\r\nample lavatories, and every modern convenience that can contribute\r\nto the comfort of passengers. The PRINCESS MAUD was placed on the\r\nservice early in 1902, and will no doubt enhance the reputation in\r\nwhich this line is held by tourists. In addition to the bi-weekly\r\nservice between Liverpool and Aberdeen, Leith, and Dundee, the\r\nRoyal Steampacket Company run a regular service of steamers between\r\nAberdeen, Newcastle, Hull, and other east coast ports, and Bristol,\r\nCardiff, and Swansea, calling also at Southampton and Plymouth.\r\nDuring the summer months this service embraces a fortnightly trip\r\nround the United Kingdom with one of the larger passenger steamers,\r\nand this has now become a favourite cruise for summer holiday\r\nseekers, occupying as it does about twelve days.\r\n\r\nWhen the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894, the Royal Company\r\nbegan at once to despatch their steamers from Manchester to Glasgow,\r\nas well as to the west, north, and east coasts of Scotland. In\r\naddition to having the management of the various services mentioned,\r\nMessrs. Langlands have, for a great many years, been the agents\r\nof Messrs. Alex. A. Laird and Co. as regards the steamers trading\r\nbetween Liverpool, Larne, and Westport.\r\n\r\nThe agency of the company’s steamers at Glasgow, Liverpool,\r\nManchester, Leith, Dundee and Hull, is in the hands of Messrs.\r\nM. Langlands and Sons, who have been closely identified with the\r\ndevelopment of the company’s business, and are largely interested in\r\nits success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nMessrs. James Little & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July, 1819, Messrs. James Little & Co., who had\r\ncommenced business seven years previously, despatched from Greenock,\r\non her maiden voyage to Liverpool, the first passenger steamer that\r\never sailed from the Clyde to the Mersey. Her name was the ROBERT\r\nBRUCE, and she was described in her advertisements as being “an\r\nelegant new Steam Packet, having most excellent accommodation for\r\npassengers.” As a matter of fact, she was a small wooden paddle\r\nsteamer, 98 feet long, or about twelve feet longer than the Cluthas\r\nthat ply up and down Glasgow Harbour, but with twice their beam.\r\nShe called at Portpatrick and Douglas (I. of M.) on her voyages\r\nto and from the Clyde, and occupied about thirty hours on the run\r\nfrom Greenock to Liverpool. The following letter from the Captain\r\n(Patterson) to Messrs. Little, written on the 1st September, 1819,\r\nindicates how different are the conditions under which passengers\r\ntravel by steamers at the present date and those which existed in the\r\nearly stages of steam navigation. Captain Patterson dated his letter\r\nfrom Troon, and stated:—\r\n\r\n“I have to inform you that we were taken with a heavy gale of wind\r\nfrom the N.W. yesterday about two o’clock, just as we had got outside\r\nthe Cumbraes, with a heavy sea; about six o’clock the sea came more\r\nto the westward, and, from the very heavy sea on our beam, we made so\r\nmuch lee-way that we could not stand out-channel nor fetch Lamlash.\r\nI, therefore thought it best to bear up for this port, and got in\r\nsafe last night with the loss of our bowsprit, but no other damage.\r\nOur engines worked very well, only the wheels had little effect\r\nowing to the heavy sea. It has continued to blow a gale all night,\r\nand still looks very bad. The ship NEREUS got here an hour before us,\r\ndismasted. I will get another bowsprit as soon as possible, and will\r\nproceed when it moderates. The passengers were all sick, but are now\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n  “I am, &c.,\r\n    “JOHN PATTERSON.\r\n\r\n“P.S.—The ROBERT BRUCE behaved under her sails, double reefed, as\r\nwell as any ship I was ever in.”\r\n\r\nThe rates of passage money were:—Cabin, 40s.; steerage, 21s. A second\r\nsteamer, the SUPERB, was placed on the station during the same\r\nseason, and in 1820 a larger steamer, the MAJESTIC, was added to the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and valuable painting of the latter steamer in 1820\r\nis in the possession of Messrs. Little & Co., at their office, 46,\r\nLeadenhall Street, London.\r\n\r\nA curious intimation appears in the Glasgow papers of the 19th\r\nJuly, 1822, with reference to the same vessel. It appears that on a\r\nrecent trip the Duke of Athol and suite had embarked on board the\r\nMAJESTIC at Greenock, for conveyance to Douglas (I. of M.), where his\r\nGrace had a seat (Mona Castle). As well as being accompanied by the\r\nmembers of his suite, His Grace had with him several carriages and a\r\nquantity of luggage, all of which took some time to land. Some of the\r\nLiverpool passengers complained of the detention of the steampacket\r\nfor this purpose, and, on the complaint being submitted to the\r\nmanagers of the steamer, they not only expressed their regret for the\r\ndelay, but they also donated the amount of freight they received from\r\nthe Duke of Athol to the fund for the relief of the starving Irish.\r\n\r\nA fourth steamer, the CITY OF GLASGOW, was added to the fleet on the\r\n21st June, 1822. The ROBERT BRUCE having become too small for the\r\nGreenock and Liverpool service was transferred to the Liverpool and\r\nDouglas station, and the three larger steamers were appointed to\r\ncarry H.M. mails to and from Greenock and Liverpool. The wretched\r\ncondition of the destitute poor in Ireland was not the only charity\r\nthat appealed to the managers of these steamers. Finding that the\r\nCommittee of the Greenock Hospital and Infirmary were in urgent need\r\nof funds, they placed the R.M.S. CITY OF GLASGOW at the Committee’s\r\ndisposal for one day, for the benefit of the Institution named. The\r\nCommittee of Management of the Hospital accordingly arranged a cruise\r\nper that steamer around Ailsa Craig, on Saturday, 19th July, 1823,\r\ntickets for which were 7s. 6d. each. The CITY OF GLASGOW continued\r\nto trade between Greenock and Liverpool until 1831, when she was\r\npurchased by the late David MacIver, who was then forming the City of\r\nGlasgow Steam Packet Co. Although Messrs. Little’s connection with\r\nBelfast is not of such long standing as with Liverpool, yet it is\r\napproaching three-quarters of a century. In January, 1828, the new\r\nsteamer FROLIC began to trade between Glasgow, Greenock and Belfast.\r\nShe differed from the steamers of the Liverpool route in carrying\r\ncargo as well as passengers. The previous year, Messrs. Little had\r\nobtained the agency in Greenock of the Glasgow and Dublin Shipping\r\nCompany. The pioneer steamer of this line was the ERIN, which sailed\r\nfrom the Clyde on her first voyage in March, 1827. A second steamer,\r\nthe SCOTIA, a vessel of 300 tons burden, was added to the service\r\nin January, 1828. The steamer WATER WITCH, built for this trade by\r\nMessrs. James Little & Co., and contracted for with Messrs. Denny &\r\nCo., of Dumbarton, was the first screw steamer built on the Clyde.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their several channel steamers, Messrs. Little owned,\r\nin 1850, the steamers DUNOON and HELENSBURGH. These two steamers\r\nplied with passengers between Greenock and coast towns, connecting\r\nwith the Glasgow and Greenock Railway (now the Caledonian Railway),\r\nand they were the first steamers on the Clyde to run in connection\r\nwith a Railway Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 this firm purchased from the owners of the Anchor Line\r\nsteamers the steamer DOM PEDRO, a screw steamer engaged in the\r\nGlasgow and Peninsular service. The DOM PEDRO was the first\r\nscrew steamer with compound engines, built by the famous Clyde\r\nshipbuilding firm, Randolph and Elder, now known as the Fairfield\r\nShipbuilding Co. Subsequently, Messrs. James Little & Co. owned a\r\nfleet of steamers bearing Greek classical names, _e.g._, APOLLO,\r\nACHILLES, &c., and to be in accordance with these the name of the DOM\r\nPEDRO was changed to the ARIADNE in the year 1875. She has now for\r\na number of years been running on the Barrow and Liverpool station.\r\nIn the year 1866, Messrs. Little ran the paddle steamer HERALD\r\nbetween Glasgow and Campbeltown. The HERALD proved herself when on\r\nthe Campbeltown route to be one of the fastest, if not the fastest,\r\nsteamer on the Clyde. She was withdrawn the following summer (1867)\r\nfrom the Glasgow and Campbeltown station, to open the Barrow and\r\nIsle of Man trade. The latter traffic is now maintained during the\r\nsummer months by the magnificent steamers, MANX QUEEN, DUCHESS OF\r\nDEVONSHIRE, or DUCHESS OF BUCCLEUCH. The MANX QUEEN is a large steel\r\npaddle steamer, with a gross register tonnage of about 1,000 tons,\r\nbuilt and engined on the Clyde by Messrs. J. and G. Thompson. Her\r\nprincipal dimensions are—length, 278 feet 9 inches; beam, 29 feet 7\r\ninches; depth, 14 feet, and her speed is about 16 knots per hour.\r\n\r\nThe DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE is a steel twin-screw steamer, built and\r\nengined in 1897 by the Naval Construction and Armaments Co., Barrow.\r\nHer gross register tonnage is 1,265 tons; her length is 300 feet;\r\nbeam, 35 feet 1 inch; and depth, 15 feet 7 inches. Her engines are\r\ncapable of driving her considerably over 18 knots per hour, and she\r\nis, therefore, one of the fastest steamers in the cross-channel trade.\r\n\r\nThe DUCHESS OF BUCCLEUCH is a steel paddle steamer, with a gross\r\nregister tonnage of 804 tons, built and engined in 1888 by the\r\nFairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., Ltd., Glasgow. Her length\r\nis 256 feet 1 inch; beam, 29 feet 1 inch; and depth 14 feet, and her\r\nspeed is about 18 knots per hour.\r\n\r\nThe route _via_ Barrow to Douglas gives the shortest sea passage from\r\nEngland to the Isle of Man, the average passage being about three\r\nhours. In consequence of this, and of the first-class accommodation\r\nprovided in these splendid steamers, the Barrow route is a favourite\r\none to the Island, and each year sees an increase in the number of\r\npassengers carried.\r\n\r\nMessrs. James Little & Co., in conjunction with the Midland and\r\nFurness Railways, established, in 1867, a service of mail, passengers\r\nand cargo steamers between Barrow and Belfast.\r\n\r\nFor the conduct of the business connected with this service, Messrs.\r\nLittle opened a branch office in Belfast, and, as they had also\r\nstarted the Barrow to Douglas trade that same year, they opened an\r\noffice in Barrow. The first steamers employed on the Barrow and\r\nBelfast station were the paddle-steamers ROE, TALBOT, and SHELBURNE.\r\nIn 1870 a larger and faster paddle-steamer, the ANTRIM, was added to\r\nthe fleet.\r\n\r\nThe service is now maintained by the swift and powerful Royal Mail\r\nSteamships CITY OF BELFAST, DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE, MANX QUEEN or\r\nLONDONDERRY. The DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE has already been briefly\r\ndescribed. Her sister vessel in the service, the CITY OF BELFAST, is\r\nslightly smaller. Her gross register tonnage is 1,055 tons.\r\n\r\nThese powerful steamers leave Belfast every evening at 8-30, Irish\r\ntime, and arrive in Barrow about 6 o’clock on the following morning,\r\nin time to connect with the early morning Midland trains to all parts\r\nof England and Scotland. The steamers leave Barrow daily (Sundays\r\nexcepted) on arrival of the through trains from London, Bristol,\r\nLeeds, &c., that is about 8-30 p.m., and arrive in Belfast about 5-30\r\nthe following morning (Irish time).\r\n\r\nIn 1873 Messrs. Little opened a branch office in Glasgow, and in\r\n1883 one in Liverpool. In addition to the mail and other steamship\r\nservices on the West Coast of Britain, Messrs. James Little & Co.\r\nhave a regular service of steamers from London to Terneuzen, in\r\nHolland, and for the efficient working of this service they, in\r\nconjunction with Mr. J. W. Johnston, opened an office in London\r\nin 1886, the name and address of the London firm being Little &\r\nJohnston, 46, Leadenhall Street, who also have a sub-office in\r\nTerneuzen.\r\n\r\nThey have also several ocean steamers, not built for any special\r\ntrade, but of large carrying capacity, under the management of their\r\nGlasgow house.\r\n\r\nThe fleet of this firm at the present date (1903) consists of\r\nfourteen full-powered steamships, having a gross registered tonnage\r\nof 25,279 tons, and named as follows:—\r\n\r\n  ANN WEBSTER                792 tons gross.\r\n  ARIADNE                    292     ”\r\n  BORDERER                  2983     ”\r\n  BORDER KNIGHT             3730     ”\r\n  CITY OF BELFAST           1055     ”\r\n  DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE     1265     ”\r\n  DUCHESS OF BUCCLEUCH       804     ”\r\n  HALLING                    777     ”\r\n  HERMISTON                 4383     ”\r\n  INDIANAPOLIS              2464     ”\r\n  LONDONDERRY                736     ”\r\n  MANX QUEEN                 989     ”\r\n  RIVERDALE                 4206     ”\r\n  RIVER LAGAN                803     ”\r\n                          ———\r\n                          25,279\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUCHESS OF BUCCLEUCH. James Little & Co.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. CLAYMORE. David MacBrayne.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVID MACBRAYNE’S WEST HIGHLAND STEAMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early part of last century Messrs. Thomson and MacConnell,\r\nof Glasgow, held a large financial interest in several of the\r\nsteampackets then plying on the River and Firth of Clyde. One of the\r\nearliest of these steamers in which they were interested was the\r\nBRITANNIA, built about two years after Bell’s COMET. The citizens of\r\nGlasgow were quick to avail themselves of the advantages of steam\r\nnavigation: thus, while in 1812 the limit of steam navigation was\r\nDunoon, in 1815 it was extended to Inverary, and in 1822 Fortwilliam,\r\nTobermory and Skye were included in the ports of call of the\r\nsteampacket HIGHLANDER.\r\n\r\nPassengers were also carried by the same steamer to the Island of\r\nStaffa, the fare for the return passage being £3 3s.\r\n\r\nSteam communication between Glasgow and Inverness _via_ the Crinan\r\nand Caledonian Canals was established in the spring of 1824, the\r\npioneer vessel being a small steamer named the BEN NEVIS.\r\n\r\nAbout 1830 Messrs. J. Martin and J. & G. Burns advertised the\r\nsteamers INVERNESS, ROB ROY and HELEN MCGREGOR to sail regularly\r\nbetween the Clyde and Inverness, Skye and Stornoway. The HELEN\r\nMCGREGOR was described as having “a splendid cabin, panelled with\r\nlandscapes descriptive of the scenery through which she passes.”\r\nShe had upwards of 30 sleeping berths for cabin passengers, and an\r\nexcellent steerage.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the SHANDON, described as “an elegant vessel,” was placed,\r\nby the same firm, on the route now taken by the R.M.S. COLUMBA. Her\r\npassengers were carried through the Crinan Canal on track boats drawn\r\nby horses ridden by postillions in brilliant scarlet uniforms, and at\r\nCrinan were transferred to the steampacket BRENDA, which conveyed\r\nthem to Oban. The latter steamer belonged to Messrs. Thomson and\r\nMacConnell, as did also the TOWARD CASTLE, MORVEN and STAFFA, and\r\nlater (1846) the EDINBURGH CASTLE and MAID OF ISLAY. The two firms\r\nhad been engaged in friendly competition both on the Glasgow and\r\nLiverpool trade and the Glasgow and West Highland service from the\r\nyear 1831, but in 1841 an arrangement was arrived at, by which the\r\nWest Highland traffic was managed conjointly.\r\n\r\nHer late Majesty Queen Victoria visited the Highlands in 1847, and in\r\n“Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands,” Her Majesty\r\nwrote:—\r\n\r\n  “The light on the hills was beautiful as we steamed down Loch\r\n  Fyne. At five we reached Lochgilp, and all landed at Lochgilphead\r\n  (Ardrishaig). We and our people drove through the village to the\r\n  Crinan Canal, where we entered a most magnificently decorated\r\n  barge, drawn by three horses ridden by postillions in scarlet. We\r\n  glided along very smoothly, and the views of the hills—the range of\r\n  Cruachan—were very fine indeed.”\r\n\r\nTo meet the requirements of an ever-increasing traffic, the elegant\r\nsaloon steamer LINNET was built, which is capable of comfortably\r\naccommodating double the number of passengers that the old track boat\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. Burns, who prior to that date had controlled a large\r\nportion of the River Clyde and West Highland traffic, in 1851 decided\r\nto confine their energies to “deep sea” steamers, and accordingly\r\nsold off their smaller craft, and Messrs. Thomson and MacConnell\r\nparted with their steamers of the same type. These vessels were\r\nacquired, and the West Highland trade taken over, by Messrs. David\r\nHutcheson & Co. (the company including Mr. David MacBrayne, the head\r\nof the present firm), whose address at that date was 14, Jamaica\r\nStreet, Glasgow.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Hutcheson had, previous to the purchase of the steamers\r\nreferred to, five steampackets named CYGNET, LAPWING, DUNTROON\r\nCASTLE, PIONEER and DOLPHIN, so that in 1851 they controlled a\r\nfleet of about a dozen steamers. These steamers maintained a\r\nbi-weekly service (in addition to other sailings) between Glasgow\r\nand Inverness, sailing from Glasgow every Monday and Thursday, a\r\nservice which has been maintained uninterruptedly for upwards of half\r\na century. The CYGNET and LAPWING were built with their paddle boxes\r\nflush with their hulls, to enable them to pass through the Crinan\r\nCanal.\r\n\r\nTwo new steamers, the CHEVALIER and MOUNTAINEER, were added to the\r\nfleet in 1854. The following year (1855) the CLANSMAN was built for\r\nthe firm. The same year the IONA (the first of the name) was built,\r\nand maintained her reputation as a “crack” Clyde steamer until 1863,\r\nwhen she was purchased by an agent of the Confederate States, to run\r\nthe blockade during the American War. She, however, never crossed the\r\nAtlantic, being sunk, as the result of a collision, before she got\r\nclear of the upper firth.\r\n\r\nShe was promptly replaced by IONA (second of the name), launched the\r\nsame year, which, after running for one season only, was also sold to\r\nrun the blockade, but is supposed to have been lost with all hands\r\noff Lundy Island. The second IONA differed from her predecessors in\r\nhaving a saloon on deck.\r\n\r\nPrior to her starting on her Atlantic voyage, this saloon was removed\r\nand placed on IONA the third. This steamer for many years bore the\r\nreputation of being the swiftest, as well as the most luxuriously\r\nappointed, steamer on the Firth of Clyde. The engines, which work\r\nwith almost incredible smoothness, are of 1,625 horse-power, and are\r\ncapable of propelling her at the rate of 18 knots per hour.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this vessel, the writer remembers a very amusing\r\nincident. Many years ago he was travelling by steamer from Liverpool\r\nto Glasgow, and in conversation a fellow-passenger stated that he had\r\nin the early part of the same summer sailed in the famous IONA from\r\nGlasgow to Ardrishaig.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of the Kyles of Bute?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The Kyles of Bute,” he replied; “I never saw them.”\r\n\r\nThe subject was dropped, until a little later he again spoke of his\r\ntrip to Ardrishaig.\r\n\r\n“And what do you think of the Kyles of Bute?” I again queried.\r\n\r\n“The Kyles of Bute; you asked me that before. I never saw them.”\r\n\r\n“But you say you sailed to Ardrishaig in the IONA?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then you must have seen the Kyles—you could not possibly have gone\r\nto Ardrishaig without seeing them.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed astonished, but after a moment’s thought a bright idea\r\nstruck him, and he exclaimed—\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes, I remember now, I saw a red board with gilt letters ‘Kyles\r\nof Bute’ on it; but I didn’t go ashore—I never saw them.”\r\n\r\nFortunately all men are not so unobservant; and so we find tourists\r\nfrom Great Britain and Ireland; from Canada and the United States;\r\nfrom South Africa and the Antipodes, journeying to enjoy not alone\r\nthe beauties of the Kyles of Bute, but also the grand and beautiful\r\nscenery of the Western Highlands, now so easy of access by the\r\nsplendid steamers of the MacBrayne fleet.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 was built the first of the trio of handsome screw steamers\r\nwhich sail regularly round the Mull of Cantyre to Stornoway and\r\nthe far North. She is named the CLYDESDALE. A larger steamer, the\r\nCLANSMAN (second of the name), was built in 1870, and one still\r\nlarger, the CLAYMORE, in 1881.\r\n\r\nMr. David Hutcheson retired in 1876, leaving his partner, Mr. David\r\nMacBrayne, sole control of the business, which has since grown\r\nsteadily, necessitating from time to time the addition of new\r\nsteamers.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the Royal Mail steamer COLUMBA was built by Messrs. J. &\r\nG. Thomson (now John Brown & Co.), of Clydebank, who were also the\r\nbuilders of the IONA. She is the largest passenger steamer on the\r\nFirth of Clyde, and few, if any, cross-channel steamers exceed her\r\nin length. According to the official description of her, she is 316\r\nfeet in length, 50 feet in breadth (inclusive of paddle boxes), and\r\n9 feet in depth. She is built entirely of steel, and is fitted with\r\ntwo oscillating engines of 220 nominal horse-power, but capable of\r\nworking up to 3,000 indicated horse-power.\r\n\r\nTwo years previously the R.M.S. COLUMBA was refitted by Messrs.\r\nHutson & Sons, Limited, with two large tubulous boilers of the\r\nhaystack type, made entirely of steel, and with twelve furnaces. When\r\nworking at full pressure, she attains a speed of 22 miles per hour,\r\nand she is certified to carry over 2,000 passengers. The COLUMBA is\r\nsteered by a steam steering engine, has the novelty of a set of steam\r\nbits at bow and stern by which the vessel is warped into piers, and\r\nhas all the modern improvements introduced on board.\r\n\r\nThe upper saloon is very luxuriously fitted up, and in the interior\r\nare reading table, writing desk and lounges. The large square windows\r\nare carried round the sides and stern, affording a fine view of the\r\nscenery through which the steamer passes.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast and dining saloon, which is 8 feet high and well\r\nventilated, has a series of separate circular tables, and meals are\r\nserved at any time. The dining saloon (forward) for steerage or\r\nfore-cabin passengers is light and airy.\r\n\r\nThe ladies’ and gentlemen’s cabins are elegantly fitted up with the\r\nusual hand-basins and other conveniences.\r\n\r\nThere is a shampooing and hairdressing establishment, with a supply\r\nof every toilet requisite; a splendid bathroom, affording passengers\r\nwho have travelled during the night the luxury of a salt-water bath,\r\nand a cloak room where they can leave hand-bags and other small\r\narticles. There are in addition a book stall and a fruit stall for\r\ncabin passengers, and for steerage passengers, a ladies’ cabin\r\nforward and several stalls (fruit stalls, &c.) are provided.\r\n\r\nThe only floating post office in the kingdom is to be found on board\r\nthe COLUMBA, and in it is transacted a larger amount of business than\r\nis transacted in many a provincial town. In it letters, telegrams\r\nand parcels are received, stamped, sorted and distributed at every\r\ncalling place, for transmission to all parts, and it is of immense\r\nconvenience to tourists and the inhabitants along the route. Upwards\r\nof 100,000 letters pass through this office in a month, of which a\r\nlarge proportion are local letters passing between the coast towns\r\nand villages at which the steamer calls. Over 450 telegrams were\r\nhanded in, and upward of £70 received for postage and telegraph\r\nstamps in one month. The most sanguine expectations of the\r\nPost Office Department being more than realised, has induced the\r\nPostmaster-General to add to the staff. Three post office officials\r\ntravel with the COLUMBA. Postal orders can be purchased, and those\r\nissued at other offices in the kingdom cashed on board this steamer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. COLUMBA. David MacBrayne.]\r\n\r\nIn 1902 Mr. David MacBrayne assumed as partners his two sons,\r\nMr. David Hope, and Mr. Laurence MacBrayne, the name of the firm\r\nremaining unchanged.\r\n\r\nMessrs. MacBrayne’s steamers navigate every sound and loch between\r\nPort Ellen in the Island of Islay, off the South-west coast of\r\nScotland, and Thurso in the extreme North, and visit almost every\r\nisland between those two points.\r\n\r\nThe new steamer LAPWING, built in the early part of the year 1903,\r\nproved very successful, and the firm have in course of construction\r\nanother fine steamer, which is expected to be ready for the service\r\nearly next year (1904). The fleet at present consists of thirty-one\r\nscrew and paddle steamships, named as follows:—\r\n\r\n                Horse   Speed.\r\n                Power.

DAVID MACIVER & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe firm of Messrs. David MacIver & Co. was originally founded by the\r\nlate Mr. David MacIver and his brother Charles, in 1835. Mr. David\r\nMacIver had some four years prior to this date formed a steamship\r\ncompany to trade between Liverpool and Glasgow, which he called\r\nthe City of Glasgow Steampacket Co. The pioneer steamer was named\r\nthe CITY OF GLASGOW, and sailed on her first voyage from Liverpool\r\non the 25th April, 1831. Three other steamers were quickly added\r\nto the fleet, viz., the SOLWAY, VULCAN and JOHN WOOD, the latter\r\nsteamer being named after a celebrated shipbuilder of Port Glasgow.\r\nIn 1835 the CITY OF GLASGOW (second) was added to the fleet, and the\r\nsame year Mr. Charles MacIver joined his brother, and the style of\r\nthe firm was altered to Messrs. David MacIver & Co., from that of\r\nthe City of Glasgow Steampacket Co. On the 1st of June, 1837, the\r\ncelebrated steamer COMMODORE was launched by Mr. John Wood, and made\r\nher first voyage, sailing from the Prince’s Pierhead, Liverpool, on\r\nthe 6th March, 1838. The COMMODORE was at that time considered to be\r\nthe most powerful, most comfortable, and fastest sea-going steamer\r\nafloat. The sister ship of this splendid steamer, the ADMIRAL, was\r\nlaunched in the beginning of the year 1840, and proved a faster\r\nvessel than her consort. On her trial trip on the 2nd April, 1840,\r\nwith a full deadweight cargo, she ran 16 miles in 56½ minutes, being\r\nfive minutes less time than it was ever done by any other steamer.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 a Mail Steamship Service between Liverpool, Canada and the\r\nUnited States was established, the respective agents being Mr.\r\nSamuel Cunard, Halifax; Messrs. J. & G. Burns, Glasgow; and Messrs.\r\nDavid and Charles MacIver, Liverpool, the latter being the practical\r\nmanagers of the company. This service, which afterwards acquired a\r\nworldwide reputation as the “Cunard Line,” was modestly inaugurated\r\nby the despatch of the Liverpool and Glasgow steamer UNICORN (Captain\r\nDouglas), which sailed from Liverpool for Halifax and Boston on\r\nSaturday morning, 16th May, 1840. After she completed her outward\r\nvoyage, she continued to ply between Pictou and Quebec, in connection\r\nwith the British and North American Royal Mail Steamers.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 was instituted the steamship service between Liverpool and\r\nHavre, the pioneer steamer being the COMMODORE, the well-known and\r\nfavourite Liverpool and Glasgow steampacket. The coasting services\r\nwere then carried on in the name of Charles MacIver & Co. About the\r\nsame date, steamship services to the Mediterranean were begun. The\r\nHavre and the Mediterranean business was conducted in the name of\r\nBurns and MacIver.\r\n\r\nThe elder of the two brothers (the founders of the “MacIver”\r\nsteamship business), Mr. David MacIver, died unmarried in 1845. His\r\nbrother, the late Mr. Charles MacIver, of Calderstones, then became\r\nthe head of the firm, which position he held until his decease in\r\n1885. In 1863 Mr. Charles MacIver admitted his eldest son, Mr. David\r\nMacIver, the present M.P. for the Kirkdale Division of Liverpool,\r\ninto partnership. Mr. David MacIver remained a partner in the firms\r\nof D. & C. MacIver, Charles MacIver & Co. and Burns & MacIver for\r\neleven years, when he retired from all three firms, and established\r\nan entirely separate steamship business, resuscitating the old title\r\nof David MacIver & Co. The first steamer built under the new regime\r\nwas the TUSCANY. She was built in 1876 by Messrs. J. & G. Thomson,\r\nGlasgow, and engined by the same eminent firm. After running in\r\nMessrs. David MacIver & Co.’s service for a number of years, she was\r\npurchased by Portuguese owners, and she is believed to have again\r\nchanged owners and to be now sailing under the Spanish flag as the\r\nMARGARITA.\r\n\r\nThe SICILY, the second steamer of the fleet, was built and engined by\r\nMessrs. Laird, Birkenhead, in 1876, and was sold to the Cullum Steam\r\nShipping Co., of London.\r\n\r\nThe following year (1877) the THESSALY and BARBARY were built for\r\nthe firm by the builders of the SICILY. The latter steamer was sold,\r\nfirst to Messrs. Booth & Co., who changed her name to the CLEMENT,\r\nand subsequently to the Cia de Cabotagem do Grão Para, by whom she\r\nwas named the MARAJO, and placed under the Brazilian flag.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of five years, the ALBANY was contracted for,\r\nalso with the Messrs. Laird, of Birkenhead. Mr. David MacIver’s\r\nconnection with Birkenhead is one of very long standing, and he has\r\nalways laboured to promote its welfare and prosperity. In recognition\r\nof his services, he was the elected representative of the Borough\r\nfrom 1874 to 1885. The ALBANY was considerably larger than any of\r\nher predecessors, her principal dimensions being—Length 300 feet 7\r\ninches, breadth 39 feet 2 inches, and depth 26 feet 4 inches; with a\r\ndeadweight capacity of about 3,500 tons. She was purchased by Messrs.\r\nT. W. Lunn & Co., of Newcastle-on-Tyne, by whom she was re-named the\r\nWILLOWDENE.\r\n\r\nA reference to the list of steamers built for Messrs. David MacIver\r\n& Co. will show the distinguishing characteristic of the names to\r\nbe the terminal letter Y. An amusing incident occurred in this\r\nconnection during the building of the steamer ALBANY. A firm of north\r\ncountry shipowners, whose steamers were named after British dukes\r\n(omitting the prefix “Duke of”), had selected “ALBANY” for a vessel\r\nthen under construction, and they made the cool request to Messrs.\r\nDavid MacIver & Co. to change the name of their steamer. It is\r\nneedless to say they were unable to comply with this request.\r\n\r\nFor the first few years, the steamers named were not employed in any\r\nregular trade, though originally designed for the Mediterranean—hence\r\nthe names TUSCANY, SICILY, BARBARY, THESSALY, &c.—but traded, as\r\ninducement offered, to the Mediterranean, the Danube, the Black Sea,\r\nand elsewhere. They have formed part of the Anchor Line to Bombay,\r\nand of the Hall Line to the same port; and they have operated in the\r\nNorth Atlantic in the service of Messrs. Richardson, Spence and Co.,\r\nbetween Liverpool and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Messrs. David MacIver & Co. despatched their first steamer\r\nto the River Plate, and two years later they established a regular\r\nservice between Liverpool and Buenos Ayres, Montevideo and Rosario.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, Mr. Charles Livingston, who had been associated with Mr.\r\nMacIver for two years previously, became a partner in the firm.\r\nMr. Livingston takes a very active part in the management of the\r\nsteamers, and he has devoted himself with great energy and success\r\nto the development of the River Plate trade with Great Britain. The\r\nfive steamers named having become too small for the requirements of\r\nthe service in which they were engaged, were disposed of, as stated,\r\nto various buyers and replaced by modern steamers of greater capacity\r\nand higher speed. These later steamers have all been designed\r\nspecially for the River Plate trade, and although large carriers, are\r\nof remarkably light draught, thus enabling them to ascend to Rosario,\r\nwithout putting consignees and shippers to the risk and expense of\r\ntranshipping cargo.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 contracts were placed with Sir Raylton Dixon & Co.,\r\nMiddlesbrough, for three steamers of exactly similar dimensions and\r\nengine power. The first of these was the SAXONY, launched December,\r\n1894. She is a steel screw steamer of 3,500 tons deadweight, and\r\nfitted with triple-expansion engines (constructed by Blair & Co.,\r\nLtd., Stockton) working up to about 1,500 horse-power effective. The\r\nfollowing month (January, 1895) her sister ship, the NORMANDY, was\r\ndelivered, and February of the same year witnessed the completion of\r\nthe third vessel, the LOMBARDY.\r\n\r\nThe steamer which succeeded these was 1,000 tons larger. She is named\r\nthe BRITTANY, and was built in 1898 by Messrs. Richardson, Duck &\r\nCo., Stockton. She is a steel screw steamer, 330 feet long, by 43\r\nfeet beam and 16 feet 6 inches depth, with a deadweight carrying\r\ncapacity of 4,500 tons. She is, like all her sister ships, propelled\r\nby triple-expansion engines constructed by Blair & Co., Ltd.,\r\nStockton.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the 20th century was marked by a further and an\r\nimportant advance in the carrying capacity of the firm’s steamers.\r\nContracts were placed with Messrs. Richardson, Duck & Co. for three\r\nsteamers, two of which are each of about 6,500 tons, and the third\r\nof about 5,500 tons deadweight. The first of the trio, the BARBARY\r\n(second of that name) was delivered in May, 1901, and the TARTARY\r\nin July following. Both these vessels are practically identical as\r\nregards size and power. They are each 370 feet long, with a beam of\r\n48 feet 1 inch, and a depth of 19 feet and a half. Their engines\r\n(triple-expansion) develop 3,000 horse-power. In November of the\r\nsame year the BURGUNDY, a vessel of somewhat smaller dimensions, was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nThe fleet of Messrs. David MacIver & Co.’s line to the River Plate at\r\npresent consists of seven full-powered steamers, but before the close\r\nof the present year an eighth steamer, the ARABY, now in course of\r\nconstruction, and of about the same dimensions as the BURGUNDY, will\r\nbe placed on the service. Formerly the steamers were each registered\r\nas a single ship company, but in 1900 they were all incorporated in\r\nDavid MacIver, Sons and Co., Ltd.\r\n\r\nThe Directors of the Limited Company are David MacIver, Esq., M.P.,\r\nhis son Charles MacIver, Esq., and Charles Livingston, Esq. The\r\nsteamers of Messrs. David MacIver and Co.’s line are deservedly\r\npopular with shippers and consignees in the River Plate trade, who\r\nare able to depend upon them for regularity of service and careful\r\nhandling of their goods, and with underwriters for their freedom from\r\nserious accidents. All the steamers are comparatively new, and are\r\nfitted with the most modern and perfect appliances for the rapid and\r\neffective loading and discharging of general cargo.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention has been given by the Company to the transit of\r\ncattle to and from the River Plate, and each of the steamers is\r\nfitted with permanent fittings for the conveyance of live stock. The\r\nheadquarters of Messrs. David MacIver and Co.’s line are, and have\r\nalways been situated in Liverpool, from which port it maintains a\r\nregular fortnightly service to and from Buenos Ayres, Montevideo and\r\nRosario, throughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMACIVER’S LIVERPOOL AND GLASGOW STEAMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1826 the New Clyde Shipping Company advertised\r\nthat their steampacket ENTERPRISE (Captain M’Farlane) would sail\r\nweekly between Liverpool and Glasgow. She was a very small steamer,\r\nbeing only 210 tons burthen, and the owners announced that, in\r\nconsequence of her light draft, she would proceed direct to Glasgow,\r\nand not transfer her passengers to river steamers at Greenock, as\r\nthe larger steamers had to do. The first agents of the company were\r\nMessrs. M’Nair and Brebner, 33, Water Street, but in January, 1829,\r\nthe agency was transferred to Mr. David MacIver, 18, Water Street.\r\nA few months later the Glasgow and Liverpool Shipping Company was\r\nformed, and in 1831 that company acquired the Mersey and Clyde Steam\r\nNavigation Company’s steampackets HENRY BELL, JAMES WATT, and WM.\r\nHUSKISSON, as well as the ENTERPRISE. The New Clyde Shipping Company\r\nhaving ceased operations, Mr. MacIver formed a new steamship line of\r\nhis own, which he called the City of Glasgow Steampacket Company. The\r\npioneer steamer was named the CITY OF GLASGOW and sailed on her first\r\nvoyage from Liverpool on the 25th April, 1831. Three other steamers\r\nwere quickly added to the fleet, viz., the SOLWAY, VULCAN, and JOHN\r\nWOOD, the latter steamer being named after a celebrated shipbuilder\r\nat Port Glasgow. In 1835 the CITY OF GLASGOW (second) was put on the\r\nstation, and the sailings were increased to three per week from each\r\nport. Mr. Charles MacIver joined his brother this year, and the style\r\nof the firm was changed to D. MacIver & Co.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 the celebrated steamship COMMODORE was built, followed in\r\n1840 by her equally famous sister ship, ADMIRAL.\r\n\r\nAll the steamers engaged in the Liverpool and Glasgow trade prior to\r\n1839 were built of wood, but in that year a new steamship company\r\nentered into competition with the existing companies, and placed the\r\nROYAL SOVEREIGN, an iron steamer, on the station., The immediate\r\nresult was a heavy drop in passenger and freight rates. Steerage\r\npassengers were carried for 1s. each, and boxes and bale goods for\r\n1d. per foot measurement. The following year (1840) a mail steamship\r\nservice between Liverpool, Canada, and U.S.A. was established, the\r\nrespective agents of the company being D. and C. MacIver, Liverpool;\r\nJ. and G. Burns, Glasgow; and Samuel Cunard, Halifax. This service,\r\nwhich afterwards acquired a world-wide reputation as the “Cunard\r\nline,” was modestly inaugurated by the despatch of the Liverpool and\r\nGlasgow steampacket UNICORN (Captain Douglas). This vessel (the real\r\npioneer of the Cunard line) sailed from Liverpool for Halifax and\r\nBoston on Saturday morning, 16th May, 1840. After she completed her\r\noutward voyage, she continued to ply between Pictou and Quebec in\r\nconnection between the British and N.A. Royal mail steamers. Although\r\nthere were three perfectly distinct steamship companies trading\r\nbetween Liverpool and Glasgow, yet so friendly were the respective\r\nowners towards each other that in 1846 they issued a joint sailing\r\nbill, which included the whole of the sailings for all the companies.\r\nThis arrangement continued unchanged for seven years (1853), at the\r\nend of which period the PRINCESS ROYAL was advertised separately.\r\nAt this date the quickest, cheapest (although the fares were double\r\nwhat they now are), and most comfortable mode of travelling between\r\nLiverpool and Glasgow was by steamer. The steamers were large, swift,\r\nand luxuriously furnished, and so numerous were the passengers that\r\nthe joint companies maintained a daily service. From the year 1853\r\nthe two services, the MacIver and the Burns, were amalgamated, the\r\njoint line being represented in Liverpool by Chas. MacIver & Co., and\r\nin Glasgow by G. and J. Burns. In 1850 Messrs. Chas. MacIver & Co.\r\ninstituted the steamship service between Liverpool and Havre, the\r\npioneer steamer being the COMMODORE, the well-known Liverpool and\r\nGlasgow steampacket. About the same date the steamship services to\r\nthe Mediterranean were begun by Messrs. MacIver, under the style of\r\nMessrs. Burns and MacIver. Until the year 1853 no distinctive class\r\nof name had been adopted for the coasting steamers of the MacIver\r\nline, but in that year the ELK and STAG were built, followed by the\r\nLYNX and STORK. These were the last of the paddle-steamers built\r\nto run between Liverpool and Glasgow. In 1855 the owners decided\r\nto place screw-steamers on this station, and accordingly built the\r\nscrew-steamers OTTER, BEAVER, and ZEBRA. The ZEBRA was a large and\r\npowerful vessel, and was amongst the earliest of the steamers taken\r\nup by Government for transport duty during the Crimean war. All the\r\nsucceeding steamers have been of the same type, and have been named\r\nafter animals or birds. The joint service remained in force for\r\nnearly half a century, until (in 1895) Messrs. G. and J. Burns opened\r\nan office in Liverpool, and placed the steamers MASTIFF, POINTER\r\nand SPANIEL on the station. The elder of the two brothers (the\r\nfounders of the “MacIver” steamship business), Mr. David MacIver,\r\ndied unmarried in 1845. His brother, the late Mr. Charles MacIver,\r\nof Calderstone, then became the head of the firm, which position he\r\nheld until his death in 1885. The long connection of the “MacIvers”\r\nwith the Cunard Company was terminated in 1883, and they retired from\r\nthe management. Messrs. Charles and Henry MacIver (the younger sons\r\nof the late Mr. Charles MacIver) retain the old styles of D. and C.\r\nMacIver (for their foreign trades) and Chas. MacIver & Co. for the\r\nsteamers trading between Liverpool and Glasgow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailboat]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nSLIGO STEAM NAVIGATION CO., LTD.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the last century Messrs. Middleton and\r\nPollexfen, of Sligo, owned a large fleet of sailing vessels. Some of\r\nthese vessels were barques which traded to foreign ports, but others\r\nwere swift, staunch schooners which traded regularly between Sligo\r\nand Liverpool, and Sligo and Bristol Channel and Glasgow. But the\r\nschooners laboured under one serious disadvantage—the uncertainty\r\nof the duration of the passage. With favourable weather it might be\r\naccomplished in a few days, but with adverse gales or fogs it might\r\noccupy as many weeks. It is self-evident that, in competition with\r\nsteamers, schooners have no chance of success, so in 1856 Messrs.\r\nMiddleton and Pollexfen decided to employ steam in their Sligo and\r\nLiverpool trade, and for this purpose built a small steamer, which\r\nthey named the SLIGO. The following year (1857) they put the SLIGO\r\non the Sligo and Glasgow station in opposition to Messrs. Cameron\r\nand Co. Five years later (1862) a company was formed with the title\r\nof the Sligo Steam Navigation Company, Limited, which took over the\r\nsteamship business of Messrs. Middleton and Pollexfen, and which has\r\ncontinued to flourish, financially and otherwise. The company in\r\n1865 built a larger steamer than the SLIGO, and named her LIVERPOOL.\r\nThe opposition in the Sligo services began under the _regime_ of\r\nMessrs. Middleton and Pollexfen, continued for some years after the\r\nformation of the Sligo Steam Navigation Company, but was finally\r\nsettled amicably. Messrs. Alexander A. Laird and Co. (successors to\r\nMessrs. Cameron and Co.) retired from the Sligo and Liverpool trade,\r\nand the Sligo Company withdrew from the Glasgow trade, purchasing\r\nthe GARLAND, which they renamed the GLASGOW. Having disposed of the\r\nSLIGO, the company purchased a swift Clyde-built cargo and passenger\r\nsteamer, to which they transferred the name. The LIVERPOOL was sold\r\nin 1892 to Preston buyers, but has been for several years, and is\r\nnow, employed by the Cunard Company to maintain their Liverpool\r\nand Havre service. The same year the largest steamer yet built by\r\nthe company was placed on the Liverpool and Sligo station. The\r\nnew vessel (the LIVERPOOL) was constructed by Messrs. John Jones\r\nand Sons, of Liverpool, and was built to the specifications and\r\nunder the supervision of Mr. H. H. West, the naval architect for\r\nthe Sligo Steam Navigation Company. She is a smart-looking boat of\r\nthe following dimensions:—Length between perpendiculars, 206 feet;\r\nbreadth, moulded, 29 feet; and depth, 15 feet 3½ inches. Her gross\r\nregister is 700 tons, and net 332 tons. The carriage of cattle being\r\na very important feature of the trade, careful consideration has been\r\ngiven to the cattle fittings. Being a larger vessel than any of her\r\npredecessors, increased accommodation is also provided for saloon and\r\ndeck passengers, as the trade is increasing in this direction very\r\nconsiderably. The saloon and cabins are fitted up in a substantial\r\nand comfortable manner. The engines (triple expansion), also\r\nconstructed by Messrs. Jones and Sons, are of 1,000 indicated h.p.\r\nOn her trial trip the LIVERPOOL attained a speed of 13 knots, being\r\na knot in excess of contract speed. The ship is lighted throughout\r\nby electricity. The loading berth for the company’s steamers was,\r\noriginally, in the Trafalgar Dock, but is now on the east side of\r\nthe Clarence Basin, a berth they have occupied since about 1867.\r\nThe company despatches the LIVERPOOL or SLIGO once a week between\r\nthe two ports, sailing from Liverpool every Tuesday, and from Sligo\r\nevery Saturday. In addition to this, its main service, the company\r\nhas a Government contract, on which the steamer TARTAR is employed.\r\nThis steamer sails twice a week in winter, and three times per\r\nweek in summer, from Sligo to Belmullet, calling at Rosses Point,\r\nBallycastle, and Belderrig, to land and embark passengers. It is a\r\nfavourite tourist route in summer, affording a splendid view of the\r\nwild coast scenery of the West of Ireland. The distance run is about\r\n70 miles, and the time occupied about six hours. The steamers of\r\nthe Sligo Steam Navigation Company, sailing between Liverpool and\r\nSligo, are exposed to all the force and fury of the Atlantic gales,\r\nas they steam along the north and north-west coasts of Ireland. It\r\nis, therefore, an eloquent testimonial to the strength of their\r\nconstruction, as well as to the ability with which they are managed,\r\nand navigated, that they sail with unfailing regularity in winter as\r\nin summer, and with a most gratifying freedom from accidents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sunset]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nWATERFORD STEAMSHIP COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1836 several Waterford merchants determined to\r\nrun steamers between Waterford and Liverpool in opposition to the\r\nsteamers owned by the Messrs. Pope, of the former port. Accordingly,\r\non the 11th January, 1837, there was launched from Mr. John Laird’s\r\nyard, Birkenhead, the DUNCANNON, a small iron paddle-steamer of\r\n200 tons burthen, to the order of the Waterford Commercial Steam\r\nNavigation Company, represented in Liverpool by Archer, Daly & Co.,\r\nof 2, Cook Street. Three years later (1840) a second steamer, the WM.\r\nPENN, was added to the service. The new company was so successful in\r\nits venture that in a short time the Messrs. Pope either abandoned\r\nthe trade, or were absorbed by their rivals, who thereupon appear\r\nto have adopted the title of the Waterford Steamship Company. There\r\nhad been for years keen rivalry between the St. George Steampacket\r\nCompany and the City of Dublin Steampacket Company, and when the\r\nbusiness of the former was transferred to the Cork Steamship\r\nCompany, the directors of the City of Dublin Company were by no\r\nmeans favourably disposed to the new management. This unfriendly\r\nfeeling was extended to the Waterford Steamship Company, because\r\nMr. Joseph Malcomson (chairman of the latter company) was offered,\r\nand accepted, a seat on the board of the Cork Steamship Company,\r\nand his firm (Messrs. Malcomson Brothers) invested largely in the\r\nCork Company’s shares. The following year the Waterford and Kilkenny\r\nRailway was opened from Waterford to Thomastown. The directors asked\r\nthe Waterford Steamship Company to change their loading berth from\r\nthe south side of the River Suir to the north side, adjacent to\r\nthe railway company’s terminus. This the steamship company refused\r\nto do. In consequence of this refusal, the Waterford and Kilkenny\r\nRailway Company induced the City of Dublin Company to put on steamers\r\nbetween Waterford and Liverpool. But, as the City of Dublin Company\r\nhad no steamers of their own available, they chartered steamers\r\nfrom the British and Irish Steampacket Company, which they placed\r\non the Liverpool and Waterford station. Meantime, the Waterford\r\nSteamship Company had not been idle. The late Liverpool agent of the\r\ncompany (Mr. George K. Payne) was detailed to organise an opposition\r\nto the railway company, with emphatic instructions not to permit\r\na single passenger to be carried by the railway company between\r\nWaterford and Thomastown, or _vice versa_. The distance was only\r\ntwelve miles, and an efficient car service was at once established\r\nbetween the two towns. Not only was the service an efficient one,\r\nbut, rather than permit passengers to travel by the railway company,\r\nthe drivers of the cars would take them for nothing. Of course,\r\nthere were not wanting those who prophesied that the Waterford\r\nCompany and the Messrs. Malcomson (who had acquired the whole of\r\nthe steamship company’s shares) would be ruined by the opposition.\r\nMalcomson Brothers, however, referred inquirers as to their stability\r\nto Messrs. Overend, Gurney & Co., then at the zenith of their power,\r\nwhose reply was:—“We guarantee Messrs. Malcomson Brothers to the\r\nextent of two million pounds sterling.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLODAGH S.S. (new 1903). Waterford Steamship Co., Ltd.]\r\n\r\nEqually fierce was the opposition in the cross-channel service.\r\nPassengers were frequently carried without charge between Liverpool\r\nand Waterford, as well as between Liverpool and Dublin. A story\r\nis told of a passenger going into the Dublin Company’s office in\r\nWaterford, and asking what the cabin fare was to Liverpool. He was\r\ntold he would be taken for nothing, to which he replied, “That is\r\nnot good enough; you must feed me as well.” A similar tradition\r\nexists with regard to the Liverpool and Dublin service, namely, that\r\nwhen one of the rival companies advertised its willingness to carry\r\npassengers for nothing, and to give them a loaf of bread, the other\r\ncompany capped the offer by the addition of a bottle of Guinness’\r\nstout. Not content with carrying the war into the enemy’s country by\r\nrunning horsecars between Waterford and Thomastown, the Waterford\r\nSteamship Company placed their steamer LION on the Liverpool and\r\nDublin station, and chartered a steamer from the Cork Steamship\r\nCompany to run in opposition to the British and Irish Company between\r\nDublin and London. Thereupon, the British and Irish Company chartered\r\na steamer from Langtry’s Belfast Steamship Company to run between\r\nLiverpool and Cork, and the Cork Company, as a counter move, placed\r\ntheir steamer MINERVA on the Liverpool and Belfast station. The\r\nopposition was maintained with unabated fierceness for about three\r\nyears, at the end of which time the City of Dublin Company and the\r\nWaterford Company arrived at an amicable settlement, each company\r\nagreeing to cease opposing the other. The Belfast Steamship Company\r\nand the British and Irish Company having now to bear the brunt of the\r\nopposition, without the support of the City of Dublin Company, deemed\r\nit wise to make the best terms they could with their opponents.\r\nAccordingly, the Belfast Company divided the Liverpool and Belfast\r\ntrade with the Cork Company, and the British and Irish Steampacket\r\nCompany shared their London and Dublin trade with the Waterford\r\nSteamship Company. The Cork Company continued to run steamers between\r\nLiverpool and Belfast for several years, but were eventually bought\r\noff by the Belfast Steamship Company. The Waterford Company ran two\r\nsteamers regularly between London and Dublin until the year 1870,\r\nwhen they also were bought off by the British and Irish Steampacket\r\nCompany. Prior to the City of Dublin Company’s opposition, the\r\nBristol Steam Navigation Company and the Waterford Steamship Company\r\nhad maintained a joint service between Waterford and Bristol. The\r\nBristol Company’s boat left Waterford on Tuesday to catch the Bristol\r\ncattle market, and the Waterford Company’s boat left Waterford on\r\nFriday. As a consequence of the low rates which were in force during\r\nthe opposition, a great deal of traffic was diverted from the Bristol\r\nroute to the Liverpool route, and the Bristol Company suspended their\r\nsailings to and from Waterford. The Waterford Company thereupon took\r\nup the Tuesday sailings to Bristol. When the Liverpool opposition\r\nceased, the Bristol Company wished to resume their Tuesday sailings\r\nfrom Waterford. The Waterford Company, however, refused to withdraw\r\ntheir Tuesday steamer, but agreed to let the Bristol Company have\r\nthe Friday sailing. The close and friendly relationship which\r\nhad formerly existed between these two companies became somewhat\r\nstrained, and ultimately ended in so wide a breach that the Waterford\r\nCompany purchased the paddle steamer VICTORY from the Cork Steamship\r\nCompany, and placed her on the station between Bristol and Dublin, in\r\nopposition to the Bristol Steam Navigation Company. This opposition\r\nwas withdrawn upon the Bristol Company undertaking to pay the\r\nWaterford Company an annual sum of £1,000, which sum they continued\r\nto pay for a great many years. About the year 1847, Malcomson\r\nBrothers (the owners of the Waterford Steamship Company) purchased\r\nthe steamer DUBLIN, for employment in one of their London trades. She\r\nwas the first screw steamer owned by any Irish company or firm, and\r\nshe proved so successful that her new owners had all their subsequent\r\nsteamers fitted with screws, except one boat for a special trade.\r\nBeing shareholders in the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation\r\nCompany, Malcomson Brothers induced the directors of that company\r\nto introduce screw steamers into their fleet. It was also by the\r\nadvice of Messrs. Malcomson that Richardson Brothers, the promoters\r\nand first managers of the Inman line, built screw steamers for the\r\nAtlantic. The Messrs. Malcomson were no mere theorists in steamship\r\nconstruction; they decided to build the steamers they owned. For\r\nthis reason they established (in 1847) an iron shipbuilding and\r\nengineering works at Waterford, under the style of the Neptune Iron\r\nWorks. They were fortunate in securing for their manager a talented\r\nshipbuilder, the late Mr. John Horn, who was succeeded by his son,\r\nMr. Andrew Horn, an engineer of very exceptional abilities, and\r\nwho is the present superintendent engineer of the company. About\r\n40 steamers were built at the Neptune Iron Works before they were\r\nclosed, several of which became famous, and all of which were noted\r\nfor their strength of hull and engines.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the Waterford Steamship Company (Malcomson Brothers) built\r\nat their Neptune Iron Works, Waterford, the steamer MARS. Her\r\noriginal plans, which were for a paddle-boat, were altered while she\r\nwas on the stocks, and she was launched a screw steamer. She was the\r\nfirst screw steamer placed on the Liverpool and Waterford station,\r\nand at first the cattle shippers did not like the idea of shipping\r\nby her, especially as on one of her early voyages she heeled over on\r\nleaving Waterford Quay, and killed a large number of cattle; but the\r\nlate Captain Burns was put in command, and she proved herself to be\r\na safe carrier, and speedily became a favourite boat in the trade.\r\nTwo years prior to this date (1847) Malcomson Brothers built at the\r\nsame yard the steamer NEPTUNE—this was the first steamer built at\r\nthe Neptune Iron Works, and she was also the first steamer to run to\r\nSt. Petersburg. It happened in this way. The Russian Government were\r\nvery anxious to get a line of steamers established between England\r\nand St. Petersburg, and made overtures on the subject to Malcomson\r\nBrothers. As a result, the latter agreed to start a line from London,\r\nof which the pioneer steamer was wrecked in the Baltic on her first\r\noutward voyage. The NEPTUNE was then despatched. When she arrived\r\nat Cronstadt the Mayor of St. Petersburg came on board in state,\r\nand as she steamed up the Neva, H.I.M. the Czar Nicholas met her in\r\nhis state barge; the forts and warships fired salutes of honour,\r\nand all the merchant ships were covered with flags. To commemorate\r\nthis important event, his Majesty the Czar commanded that whenever\r\nthe NEPTUNE came to St. Petersburg she was to be free of port and\r\npilotage dues.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I write, it was impossible to over-estimate the\r\ninfluence of Malcomson Brothers in the commercial steamship world. We\r\nhave seen how they were consulted by the directors of the P. and O.,\r\nand by the promoters of the Inman line. In addition to their coasting\r\nfleets they had steamers in the Eastern trade, one of which—the\r\nUNA—was one of the first steamers to pass through the Suez Canal.\r\nThey were also the pioneers of the Liverpool and River Plate trade,\r\nand were, I believe, the predecessors of Lamport and Holt. Amongst\r\nthe large fleet of steamers built for the Waterford Steamship Company\r\nat their own shipbuilding and engineering works was a screw steamer,\r\nthe WILLIAM PENN. This steamer was sold by the Waterford Steamship\r\nCompany, and her new owners, having lengthened her and given her a\r\nfourth mast, renamed her the EUROPEAN. As the EUROPEAN she ran for a\r\nnumber of years in H. N. Hughes and Nephew’s line between Liverpool\r\nand Bombay. She afterwards was transferred to, or chartered by, Geo.\r\nWarren and Co., and while in their Boston and Liverpool service,\r\nin the early seventies, she had the proud distinction of being the\r\nfirst steamer to bring to Liverpool an importation of American live\r\ncattle, consigned to Geo. Roddick and Co., Chapel Walks. Since the\r\nwithdrawal of the Malcomsons from the active control of the company,\r\nthe management of the Waterford Steamship Company has been vested in\r\nMr. C. Morley, under whose able management the steamers have been\r\nmaintained in a state of thorough efficiency and up-to-dateness. The\r\nfleet of the company at the present date consists of the following\r\npowerful steamers, which make their passages to and from Liverpool\r\nand Waterford with unfailing regularity in about 18 hours, summer and\r\nwinter, viz.:—LARA, COMERAGH, REGINALD, DUNBRODY and MENAPIA.\r\n\r\nThe DUNBRODY has a complete installation of electric light,\r\nincluding the holds, and her lower holds for the entire length form\r\na refrigerator. A further and larger addition, the CLODAGH, now\r\nbuilding, will shortly be added to the fleet, embracing all the above\r\nimprovements, with an increased speed, and increased first-class\r\npassenger accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe Waterford Steamship Company were amongst the first steamship\r\nowners to discard the bowsprit and figure-head, and to adopt the\r\nstraight stem. They were also amongst the first owners to build\r\nsteamers with saloons amidships, and it is their proud boast that in\r\nthe Liverpool and Waterford service, extending over sixty years, they\r\nnever lost a ship or a human life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The late T. H. ISMAY, Esq.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nWHITE STAR LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Star Line was founded about the middle of the last century\r\nby the owners of a line of smart clippers sailing between England\r\nand Australia. The great rush of adventurers to the Australian gold\r\ndiggings in the “fifties” gave a great impetus to the trade between\r\nGreat Britain and the Colonies. In the course of seven years the\r\nWhite Star, Black Ball and other lines carried about half a million\r\npassengers to the Antipodes. The “White Star” boats, even in those\r\ndays, were the largest of their class, and amongst them were the\r\nfamous wooden clippers GOLDEN ERA, CHAMPION OF THE SEAS, BLUE\r\nJACKET, and WHITE STAR, vessels of from 3,000 to 4,500 tons gross.\r\nAn important change took place in the destinies of the line in 1867,\r\nwhen the managing owner retired, and the late Thomas Henry Ismay\r\ntook over the flag. Two years later came the great event in the\r\nhistory of the White Star Line, when Mr. Ismay induced some friends\r\nto join him in the formation of the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company.\r\nIt was an enterprise boldly conceived, and carried out with great\r\njudgment. Boldly conceived, for there were already four companies\r\neach maintaining a regular weekly service between Liverpool and New\r\nYork. Nor were these small companies, or of indifferent reputation.\r\nThere was the Cunard Company, established about thirty years\r\npreviously; the Inman Line, with a fine fleet of clipper passenger\r\nsteamers; the Guion Line, with its large American connections; and\r\nthe National Line, with its fleet of huge cargo carriers. In spite of\r\nthis, Mr. Ismay was confident that there was room for a high-class\r\nTrans-Atlantic passenger service, and the shares in the new company\r\n(£1,000 each fully paid) were at once privately taken up by the firm\r\nof T. H. Ismay & Co. and their friends, amongst whom were some of\r\nthe most substantial names in England. The following year Mr. Imrie\r\n(of the late firm of Imrie, Tomlinson & Co.) joined Mr. Ismay, and\r\nthe style of the firm was altered to Ismay, Imrie & Co.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken by the managers of the Oceanic Steam Navigation\r\nCompany was to arrange with the celebrated shipbuilders, Messrs.\r\nHarland and Wolff, Belfast, for the construction of a fleet of\r\nhigh-class steamships, expressly for the American passenger trade.\r\nThe pioneer vessel of the line (the OCEANIC) was launched on the\r\n27th August, 1870, and started on her maiden voyage under the White\r\nStar flag on the 2nd March, 1871. After running for several years\r\nbetween Liverpool and New York, this steamer (OCEANIC, the first),\r\nalong with her sister ships, GAELIC and BELGIC, were chartered to\r\nthe Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company, of San Francisco, to\r\nmaintain a mail service between that port and the Orient. The OCEANIC\r\nwas quickly followed on the Liverpool-New York service by the BALTIC,\r\nREPUBLIC, ADRIATIC and CELTIC, and weekly sailings from both ports\r\nwere instituted. These steamers were all of the one type, straight\r\nstems, four masts, single funnel, and saloon amidships. They proved\r\nthemselves to be equal in speed and superior in accommodation to any\r\nships then afloat. Four more steamers were added to the fleet in\r\n1873, viz., the ASIATIC, TROPIC, GAELIC and BELGIC. A great advance\r\non the earlier steamships was made in 1874, when the BRITANNIC was\r\nlaunched, followed by her sister ship, the GERMANIC, in 1875. Prior\r\nto the formation of the White Star Atlantic Fleet, the passage\r\nbetween Liverpool and New York had averaged 9½ or 10 days, the\r\nOCEANIC and her consorts reduced it to about 8½ days, whilst the\r\nBRITANNIC and GERMANIC brought the time down to about 7½ days.\r\n\r\nThese vessels, with the exception of the two last named which were\r\nlarger and faster, were almost uniform in size and speed. These,\r\nand the later vessels of the fleet, were designed and built to\r\nattain the three-fold purpose of safety, speed and comfort, and\r\ntheir performances have certainly realised the expectations of their\r\nowners. Speed has been an important, but a secondary, consideration,\r\nas is shewn by the following extract from the “Book of Regulations”\r\nof the White Star Line of steamers:—\r\n\r\n  “The commanders must distinctly understand that the issue of the\r\n  following instructions does not, in any way, relieve them from\r\n  entire responsibility for the safe and efficient navigation of\r\n  their respective vessels; and they are also enjoined to remember\r\n  that, whilst they are expected to use every diligence to secure a\r\n  speedy voyage, they must run no risk which might by any possibility\r\n  result in accident to their ships. It is to be hoped that they\r\n  will ever bear in mind that the safety of the lives and property\r\n  entrusted to their care is the ruling principle that should govern\r\n  them in the navigation of their ships, and no supposed gain in\r\n  expedition or saving of time on the voyage is to be purchased at\r\n  the risk of accident. The company desires to establish and maintain\r\n  for its vessels a reputation for safety, and only looks for such\r\n  speed on the various voyages as is consistent with safe and prudent\r\n  navigation.”\r\n\r\nNot content with giving this general regulation, the managers have\r\nissued to the commanders of the respective ships of the fleet a\r\nspecial autograph letter, laying special emphasis on the supreme\r\nimportance of extreme and unvarying caution and prudence in the\r\nnavigation of the company’s vessels. The concluding paragraph of this\r\nletter is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “Under all these circumstances of paramount and engrossing interest\r\n  to the company, whose property is under your charge, we invite\r\n  you to dismiss from your mind all idea of competitive passages\r\n  with other vessels, the advantage of success in which is merely\r\n  transient, concentrating your whole attention upon a cautious,\r\n  prudent, and ever-watchful system of navigation which shall lose\r\n  time, or suffer any other temporary inconvenience, rather than run\r\n  the slightest risk which can be avoided.”\r\n\r\nThe BRITANNIC when she first came out was fitted with a novelty in\r\nthe shape of a “lifting propeller.” This propeller was a patent of\r\nthe late Sir Edward Harland, senior partner of the firm by whom the\r\nBRITANNIC was built. In long ships the pitching in a heavy sea, and\r\nthe vertical motion of the waves, tend to expose the upper portion\r\nof the propeller, the evil effects arising from this being the\r\n“racing” of the engines and its attendant dangers, together with a\r\ndiminished speed. Sir Edward Harland believed that a propeller which\r\ncould be worked at any depth, and which did not require the stoppage\r\nof the vessel whilst it was being raised or lowered, would reduce\r\nthese risks to a minimum, if it did not entirely remove them. In\r\nactual practice, however, it was found that the advantages of the\r\nnew principle did not compensate for its disadvantages, and, after a\r\nfair trial had been given to it, it was abandoned in favour of the\r\nold style of screw. In a letter, dated 3rd December, 1874, addressed\r\nto the late Mr. W. S. Lindsay, Messrs. Ismay, Imrie & Co. state:—“The\r\naverage speed of the BRITANNIC is fifteen knots per hour on a\r\nconsumption of 75 to 80 tons of coal per day, and her approximate\r\ncost, built without contract, is £200,000.”\r\n\r\nFrom 1873 until 1884 the White Star Line maintained its position as\r\nthe fastest fleet on the Atlantic, a result to which the BRITANNIC\r\nand GERMANIC contributed in no small degree. In September, 1890, the\r\nBRITANNIC eclipsed her own previous record of 7 days 9½ hours, by\r\ncrossing from New York to Queenstown in 7 days 6 hours 55 minutes,\r\nat an average speed of 16·80 knots. The following year (September,\r\n1891) she surpassed even this rapid passage, by making the run from\r\nNew York to Queenstown in 7 days 6 hours 52 minutes. While employed\r\nby H.M. Government to convey troops during the late war in South\r\nAfrica, she made the run from Queenstown to the Cape in 19 days, a\r\nspeed surpassed by few of the transports engaged. In August, 1891,\r\nthe GERMANIC following in the track of her sister ship, travelled\r\nfrom New York to Queenstown in 7 days 7 hours 37 minutes, at an\r\naverage speed of 16·10 knots per hour. When it is remembered that\r\nthis high speed (nearly nineteen statute miles per hour) was attained\r\nby vessels over 20 years old, with their original compound engines\r\nand boilers, it will be acknowledged that, having regard to their\r\nsmall coal consumption and large carrying capacity, the BRITANNIC and\r\nGERMANIC have given results unattainable with the fastest ships of\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nThe GERMANIC in 1895 received new engines and boilers, and had her\r\npassenger quarters entirely remodelled on the plan of the MAJESTIC\r\nand TEUTONIC. In July of that year she crossed from Queenstown\r\nto New York in 6 days 23 hours 45 minutes, and in August of the\r\nyear following in 6 days 21 hours and 38 minutes, thus showing a\r\nsubstantial increase of speed.\r\n\r\nAfter the launch of these two famous steamers, there was an interval\r\nof six years during which no new vessels were added to the fleet.\r\nThe next additions were the ARABIC and COPTIC, for the Trans-Pacific\r\ntrade, in 1881. In the same year Mr. W. S. Graves, son of a\r\nwell-known former M.P. for Liverpool, became a partner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OCEANIC (1870). White Star Line.]\r\n\r\nIn 1883 the IONIC and DORIC were built for the New Zealand trade—the\r\nShaw, Savill and Albion Line from London. In 1885 the GAELIC and\r\nBELGIC—replacing the two older ships of the same names—were built\r\nfor the Trans-Pacific trade. A new type of steamer for the cargo and\r\ncattle trade between Liverpool and New York was introduced in 1888,\r\nthe two first steamers of the new type being the CUFIC and RUNIC.\r\nThese vessels were the last single screw ships ordered for the White\r\nStar Line, all the succeeding vessels being of the twin-screw type.\r\nThe CUFIC and RUNIC proved successful enough to warrant the company\r\nin forming a complete service of cargo and cattle steamers. After\r\ndoing very efficient service as cattle carriers, the CUFIC was sold\r\nto a Liverpool firm, who changed her name to the MANXMAN, and the\r\nRUNIC, also sold to a Liverpool firm, is engaged in the West Indian\r\ntrade under the name of the TAMPICAN.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1889, was launched the TEUTONIC, the first of the\r\ncelebrated pair of twin-screw mercantile armed cruisers (TEUTONIC and\r\nMAJESTIC), each 10,000 tons, which have since made for themselves a\r\ngreat reputation in the New York mail and passenger service. The keel\r\nof the TEUTONIC was laid in March, 1887. The vessel was launched 22\r\nmonths later, and she left Liverpool on her maiden voyage to New York\r\non the 7th August, 1889. Prior to going on to her regular station,\r\nshe was present, armed with eight quick-firing guns, at the naval\r\ninspection by the German Emperor at Spithead in the beginning of\r\nAugust, 1889. On that occasion she astonished nautical critics with\r\nher splendid proportions, and was honoured by a special visit from\r\nH.I.M. the Kaiser, and H.R.H. the Prince of Wales (now H.M. King\r\nEdward VII.). She was again present with a large party of guests at\r\nthe Diamond Jubilee Naval Review in June, 1897, when she carried an\r\narmament of 16 guns. Her sister ship, the MAJESTIC, was launched on\r\nthe 29th June, 1889, but did not start on her first voyage until the\r\n2nd April, 1890.\r\n\r\nThe length of time occupied in the building of these great ships is\r\nsufficient evidence, if any were needed, of the great care bestowed\r\non their construction, and the builders, Messrs. Harland & Wolff,\r\nhave their reward in witnessing the successful work which is being\r\nperformed by two of the finest vessels the world has ever seen. These\r\ntwo beautiful vessels quickly lowered the record on the Atlantic.\r\nIn July, 1891, the MAJESTIC steamed from Queenstown to New York in\r\n5 days 18 hours and 8 minutes, the fastest passage then on record,\r\nbut even this was eclipsed by the TEUTONIC the succeeding month by a\r\npassage of 5 days 16½ hours duration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. TEUTONIC. White Star Line.]\r\n\r\nOn January 1st, 1891, Mr. Ismay’s two elder sons, Mr. J. Bruce Ismay\r\n(previously the company’s agent in New York) and Mr. James H. Ismay,\r\nwere admitted members of the firm. After 40 years’ business life Mr.\r\nT. H. Ismay, on the 31st December, 1891, retired from the firm of\r\nIsmay, Imrie & Co., but he continued to fill the position of chairman\r\nof the White Star Line until his decease in November, 1899.\r\n\r\nA large and handsome twin-screw passenger and mail steamer, the\r\nGOTHIC, of 7,755 tons, was added to the company’s New Zealand fleet\r\nin 1893, and four years later (1897) the DELPHIC, 8,273 tons, a\r\ntwin-screw cargo steamer, with accommodation for one class of\r\npassengers only, was placed in the New Zealand service.\r\n\r\nRecognising that very considerable numbers of passengers are\r\nwilling to sacrifice speed to comfort and safety, the managers of\r\nthe White Star Line determined to make an innovation by building\r\na twin-screw cargo steamer of exceptional size and power, fitted\r\nwith accommodation for a limited number of saloon and third-class\r\npassengers. The new steamer which was called the CYMRIC, commenced\r\nwork in the Liverpool and New York trade in 1898. Her tonnage is\r\n13,096 tons gross. Her passenger accommodation in both classes is\r\nexcellent, and she has proved a very attractive ship.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1899 was the most eventful period in the history\r\nof the White Star Line. The Company, having sold all its sailing\r\nships formerly employed between England and Australia, determined\r\nupon replacing them by a line of high-class steamships, and the\r\nfirst steamer of the new line—the Medic, 11,984 tons—sailed from\r\nLiverpool for Australian ports on the 3rd August. She was followed\r\nby the AFRIC, PERSIC, RUNIC and SUEVIC. All these five vessels\r\nare approximately of the same size, propelled by twin screws, and\r\nmaintain a regular monthly service between Liverpool and Australia,\r\nvia the Cape. The first return voyage of the MEDIC was taken\r\nadvantage of by the Australian Government for the conveyance of the\r\nfirst contingent of Colonial troops and horses to the Cape. Intense\r\npublic interest was excited by the arrival, in the Mersey from\r\nBelfast of the OCEANIC, the second, on Saturday, 27th August, 1899,\r\nbut almost at the moment of their greatest triumph the White Star\r\nLine suffered the irreparable loss of the founder of the Company. Mr.\r\nT. H. Ismay passed away, after a severe illness lasting three months,\r\non the 23rd November, 1899. The extent of the loss caused by his\r\ndeath to the community at large, was very feelingly expressed by the\r\n“Times,” in its issue of the following day.\r\n\r\nThe second OCEANIC sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New\r\nYork on the 6th September, 1899. The following description of her\r\nappeared in the “Liverpool Daily Post” of 31st August, 1899:—\r\n\r\n  “Big as she is, the OCEANIC appeared nothing remarkable as she lay\r\n  yesterday in the Canada Dock, while coal was being poured into her\r\n  bunkers from eight grimy barges lying alongside. This was because\r\n  the Liverpool docks are themselves gigantic. It was only when,\r\n  from the bridge of the OCEANIC, 66 feet above the water-line,\r\n  one looked down upon the whole length of the vessel and upon the\r\n  expanse of docks and sheds, that her size was realised. On the\r\n  opposite side of the dock was the CYMRIC, from the depths of which\r\n  a horde of labourers were discharging cargo. Now the CYMRIC is\r\n  the largest cargo steamer in the world, 2,500 tons larger than\r\n  either the MAJESTIC or TEUTONIC. But from the OCEANIC’S bridge she\r\n  looked positively like a coaster. One looked down upon her busy\r\n  decks as one might look from the roof of a house into a street.\r\n  Why the bulk of the OCEANIC is not the first thing that strikes\r\n  the attention, is because her lines are graceful. She is huge,\r\n  but she is not elephantine. Her masts, even at the point where\r\n  they enter the top mast or spar deck, are nearly three feet in\r\n  diameter, that is, they are as high and as thick as patriarchal\r\n  oak; but from a near distance they look slim and tapering. The same\r\n  may be said of the ship’s boats which are as big as barges. The\r\n  fact is, that everything about this latest creation of shipping\r\n  enterprise is proportioned so beautifully that the mere hugeness of\r\n  it all is only apprehended by remembering such facts as, that her\r\n  rudder and stern frame weigh 150 tons; that 100 tons of cable lie\r\n  coiled on her foc’sle deck; that she is composed of 17,000 steel\r\n  plates, many weighing from two to three and a quarter tons; that\r\n  her promenade deck is 400 feet long; and that her monster engines\r\n  can move with the power of 28,000 horses. To look down into the\r\n  engine room from the big sky-light on the top deck is to have a\r\n  glimpse into a world that to people not used to shipping is one of\r\n  strange activity; a world where diminutive human ants are moving in\r\n  a tropical atmosphere across narrow bridges, busy preparing this\r\n  Brobdignagian apparatus for its first struggle with the forces of\r\n  the wide Atlantic, which the OCEANIC is to cross with the speed and\r\n  certainty of an express train—the conquest of the mighty force of\r\n  matter by the mighty force of mind....\r\n\r\n  “But much has been written already of the ship as a triumph of\r\n  science; the more immediate purpose here is to speak of her as a\r\n  triumph of art, as the last thing, so far, in the way of floating\r\n  hotels.... State rooms in scores to the right and to the left; now\r\n  mahogany, now oak; now satinwood; now a mixture of any two or three\r\n  of them, until the lavishness of everything became surfeiting,\r\n  notwithstanding that the Louis Quinze style succeeded the Queen\r\n  Anne, and the Queen Anne gave place to something ‘too utter’ in\r\n  decadent sumptuousness. Three decks of these apartments, with\r\n  lavatories of costly marble, suites of baths, and every other\r\n  appurtenance of physical comfort placed conveniently here and\r\n  there. It is the literal truth to say that the OCEANIC is a Hotel\r\n  Cecil afloat.”\r\n\r\nIt would serve no purpose to weary the reader with a decorator’s\r\nspecification, but the following are the dimensions of the OCEANIC,\r\nand of the principal apartments on board:—\r\n\r\nThe library, on the promenade deck, has a length of 53 feet and a\r\nwidth of 40 feet.\r\n\r\nThe saloon is 80 feet by 64 feet. The central glass dome is 21 feet\r\nsquare, and is divided up by golden ribs and filled in with white\r\nground glass of a pearly appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. OCEANIC (1899). White Star Line.]\r\n\r\nThe length of the ship over all is 705½ feet; the length between\r\nperpendiculars, 685 feet; breadth, 68 feet; depth, 44 feet; gross\r\ntonnage, 17,274 tons; load displacement, 28,000 tons; engines, 28,000\r\nI.H.P.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. CELTIC. White Star Line.]\r\n\r\nMr. Harold Arthur Sanderson, who had occupied the position of general\r\nmanager to Ismay, Imrie & Co. for five years, was admitted a partner\r\non the 1st January, 1900. The CELTIC, a monster steamer of 20,904\r\ntons gross, was added to the fleet in 1901. A sister ship to the\r\nCELTIC was launched at Belfast on the 21st August, 1902. The new\r\nvessel is named the CEDRIC, and has the distinction of exceeding in\r\nsize anything afloat, British or foreign. Like the CELTIC, she is\r\nclassed as an intermediate ship, not so fast as the OCEANIC, but yet\r\nspeedy. Her length is 700 feet and her beam 75 feet, with a gross\r\ntonnage of 21,000 tons. She sailed on her first voyage from Liverpool\r\non the 11th February, 1903.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.M.S. CYMRIC. White Star Line.]\r\n\r\nIn 1902 Mr. J. P. Morgan succeeded in welding into one huge\r\ncommercial undertaking, with a capital of £32,000,000, several of the\r\nprincipal Transatlantic steamship companies, including the famous\r\nWhite Star Line. The purchase money for the latter alone exceeded ten\r\nmillions sterling, three millions of which was payable in cash on\r\nthe 31st December, 1902, and, as a matter of fact, was actually paid\r\nat the offices of Messrs. J. P. Morgan & Co., in London, on the 1st\r\nDecember, 1902.\r\n\r\nIt was a sincere satisfaction to the British public when it was\r\nofficially intimated that the White Star flag was still to be\r\nretained, and that Mr. J. Bruce Ismay and Mr. Pirrie (the senior\r\npartner of the celebrated Belfast shipbuilding firm) were to be on\r\nthe directorate.\r\n\r\nThe latest addition to the New York service of the White Star Line is\r\nthe ARABIC, 15,800 tons gross register, which sailed on her maiden\r\nvoyage, June 26th, 1903, and in the autumn of 1903 the four latest\r\nsteamers built for the Dominion Line, the COLUMBUS, COMMONWEALTH, NEW\r\nENGLAND and MAYFLOWER, were transferred to the White Star flag, and\r\nrenamed the REPUBLIC, CANOPIC, ROMANIC and CRETIC. With the addition\r\nof these vessels, a new service has been announced of sailings\r\nbetween Boston and the principal ports in the Mediterranean, and,\r\nin conjunction with the other steamships, the CYMRIC is intended to\r\nmaintain a Liverpool-Boston service.\r\n\r\nA monster steamer of no less than 24,000 tons (an increase of 3,000\r\ntons upon the CEDRIC’s tonnage) is approaching completion at the yard\r\nof Harland & Wolff. She is to be named the BALTIC, and will probably\r\nbe ready early in the summer of 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n  Adelaide Steamship Co., Limited.—John Bacon, Limited.—R. Burton &\r\n  Sons, Limited.—Fletcher, Woodhill & Co.—T. & J. Harrison.—W. S.\r\n  Kennaugh & Co.—Lamport & Holt.—H. & W. Nelson.—R. & J. H. Rea.—J.\r\n  S. Sellers.—Henry Tyrer & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following firms hold a prominent position in their respective\r\ntrades—Foreign and Coastwise—and most of them have been established\r\nfor many years:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =Adelaide Steamship Co., Lim.=, was established in October, 1875,\r\nits nominal capital being £100,000. In November, 1882, the capital\r\nof the Company was increased to £300,000, and in December, 1900, a\r\nfurther reconstruction of the Company occurred, the capital being\r\nincreased to £750,000. The first two steamers built for the Company\r\nwere the SOUTH AUSTRALIAN and the VICTORIAN. Each was slightly over\r\n400 tons register, making a total of 900 tons; whereas the present\r\ncapacity of the Company’s fleet (consisting of 25 steamers) is about\r\n50,000 tons. The steamers, on their various routes, trade to and from\r\nnearly every port on the Australian seaboard. Amongst the vessels\r\nowned by the Adelaide Steamship Co. is the FERRET, whose romantic\r\nstory is told in the first part of this volume. (See ante, page 137).\r\n\r\n\r\n=John Bacon, Lim.=—This firm was established about the middle of the\r\nlast century by the late Mr. John Bacon. Mr. Bacon died in 1886, and\r\nthree years later the business was formed into a Limited Company. The\r\nfleet of the Company at the present date consists of the steamers\r\nEDEN VALE, EDITH, HEPTARCHY, PRESTONIAN, STUART, SUNLIGHT, TALBOT,\r\nTUDOR, VIGILANT, and WEXFORD. These steamers maintain regular\r\nsailings between Liverpool and Wexford, Liverpool and the Bristol\r\nChannel Ports, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n=R. Burton & Sons.=—The firm of R. Burton & Sons was founded by\r\nthe late Mr. R. Burton, of Newport, Mon., over one hundred years\r\nago, and since 1840 has been carried on by his three sons. In 1898\r\nthe business was transferred to a Limited Company, with a capital\r\nof £100,000, the major portion of the shares being retained by the\r\nMessrs. Burton. The Company maintains regular services between\r\nLiverpool and various ports in the Bristol Channel, a daily service\r\nbetween Bristol and Cardiff, and a daily service between Bristol and\r\nNewport, Mon.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fletcher, Woodhill & Co.=—This firm was established at Manchester,\r\nin 1893, by Mr. H. A. Fletcher (of Liverpool) and Captain T. J.\r\nWoodhill (of Sunderland). Since the opening of the Ship Canal Messrs.\r\nFletcher, Woodhill & Co. have taken an active part in the steamship\r\nbusiness of the port of Manchester. Their present services are\r\nbetween Manchester and France; Manchester, Portugal and Spain; and\r\nManchester and Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=T. & J. Harrison.=—This important Steamship Company maintains\r\nregular sailings from Liverpool to Calcutta, New Orleans, Galveston,\r\nBrazil and West Indies, and South of France; also joint sailings\r\nof Ellerman-Harrison Line from Glasgow and Liverpool to South and\r\nEast Africa. The fleet at the present date (1904) consists of 36\r\nfull-powered steamships, exclusive of two steamers building, with\r\nan aggregate gross tonnage of 179,166 tons:—ACTOR, BARRISTER,\r\nCAPELLA, CHANCELLOR, CIVILIAN, COGNAC, COLLEGIAN, COLONIAL, COMEDIAN,\r\nCOUNSELLOR, CRAFTSMAN, CUSTODIAN, DICTATOR, DIRECTOR, ELECTRICIAN,\r\nEXPLORER, HISTORIAN, INVENTOR, JARNAC, LOGICIAN, MAGICIAN,\r\nMECHANICIAN, MIRA, MUSICIAN, NAVIGATOR, ORION, PATRICIAN, POLITICIAN,\r\nSENATOR, STATESMAN, TACTICIAN, TRAVELLER, WANDERER, WAYFARER,\r\nWORKMAN, YEOMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n=W. S. Kennaugh & Co.= commenced business of steamship owners at\r\na time when sailing vessels were being displaced in the general\r\ncoasting trade by steamers. The first boat built for the firm was the\r\nSCALE FORCE, famous in her day for her large carrying powers on a low\r\nnet register. She was designed by a brother of the senior partner of\r\nthe firm, by whom all the succeeding steamers have been designed. The\r\nnames of the steamers at the present date owned by this firm are the\r\nAIRA FORCE, BIRKER FORCE, HOLME FORCE, and STANLEY FORCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lamport & Holt Line.=—The Liverpool, Brazil and River Plate Steam\r\nNavigation Co., Limited, better known as the “Lamport & Holt” Line,\r\nwas formed in 1865, the first Managers of the Line being the late\r\nMr. William James Lamport, and Mr. George Holt. This Company is one\r\nof the largest of the Steamship Companies of Liverpool, at which\r\nPort its headquarters are situated. It owns a fleet, of thirty-nine\r\nfull-powered modern cargo steamers, ranging from 1,671 tons to 6,508\r\ntons, the average per steamer being 3,375 tons and the aggregate\r\ntonnage 131,654 tons gross register, representing a total dead weight\r\ncarrying capacity of about 200,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe Company has given special attention to the transit of cattle\r\nto and from the River Plate, in which trade it has nine steamers,\r\nspecially built for this service, having permanent fittings for the\r\nconveyance of live-stock.\r\n\r\nThese vessels have a most satisfactory record for the carriage of the\r\ncattle shipped by them. Live stock are also carried between New York\r\nand Manchester by boats specially adapted to the requirements of the\r\nNorth Atlantic Trade.\r\n\r\nAll the steamers of the Lamport and Holt fleet are fitted with the\r\nmost modern appliances for the rapid and effective handling of\r\ngeneral cargo. The operations of the Company are varied and extensive\r\nand comprise the following regular services:—From Glasgow, Manchester\r\nand Liverpool to Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Santos, fortnightly. From\r\nLondon and Antwerp to Rio de Janeiro and Santos, every ten days. From\r\nNew York (carrying first and third-class passengers) to Pernambuco,\r\nBahia, Rio de Janeiro and Santos, fortnightly. Also to the River\r\nPlate from Liverpool, fortnightly; from Glasgow, monthly; from London\r\nand Antwerp, fortnightly; and from New York at frequent intervals.\r\nA regular monthly service is also maintained between Liverpool,\r\nGlasgow, and West Coast ports in Chili, Peru, and Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThe steamers of this Line have always been very popular with\r\nshippers, who are able to depend upon regularity of service, and\r\ncareful handling of their goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n=H. & W. Nelson, Limited.=—This remarkably successful Company was\r\nfounded in 1889, by Messrs. Hugh and William Nelson.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer steamer of the fleet was the steamer SPINDRIFT, now the\r\nHIGHLAND SCOT, which sailed from Liverpool on her maiden voyage on\r\nthe 12th December, 1889.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGHLAND BRIGADE S.S. H. & W. Nelson, Limited.]\r\n\r\nA few months later (May, 1890) the second steamer of the line, the\r\nHIGHLAND CHIEF, was launched, and the following year three additional\r\nsteamers were built for the Company, and named respectively the\r\nHIGHLAND GLEN, HIGHLAND LASSIE and HIGHLAND MARY.\r\n\r\nSince that date, nine vessels (including three now building) have\r\nbeen added to the fleet, which consists of fourteen powerful modern\r\nsteamships of large carrying capacity. These steamers are all very\r\nsimilar in design (though several are much larger) to the HIGHLAND\r\nENTERPRISE, of which particulars are given below.\r\n\r\nThe HIGHLAND ENTERPRISE was launched in January of the present year\r\n(1903). She is 385 feet long, between perpendiculars; with 45 feet\r\nbeam, and draft laden 23 feet 6 inches. She has a carrying capacity\r\nof 6,500 tons. Like her sister ships, she is insulated throughout\r\nfor carrying frozen meat, and fitted with the latest type of\r\nrefrigerating machinery, as well as the most up-to date appliances\r\nfor the effective handling of general cargo. Accommodation has been\r\nprovided amidships for about a dozen passengers. Her engines, which\r\nare of the triple-expansion type, propelled her on her trial trip at\r\na speed equal to 13¾ knots per hour.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a regular fortnightly service between Liverpool and\r\nMonte Video, Buenos Ayres and Rosario, the steamers of the Nelson\r\nLine sail at regular monthly intervals from London and Newport (Mon.)\r\nto the River Plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEET.\r\n\r\n                      TONS REG.\r\n  HIGHLAND BRIGADE     5,640\r\n  HIGHLAND CHIEF       2,640\r\n  HIGHLAND CORRIE      4,050\r\n  HIGHLAND ENTERPRISE  4,500\r\n  HIGHLAND GHILLIE     3,935\r\n  HIGHLAND GLEN        2,974\r\n  HIGHLAND HARRIS      5,500\r\n  HIGHLAND HEATHER     5,500\r\n  HIGHLAND HOPE        4,500\r\n  HIGHLAND LAIRD       4,116\r\n  HIGHLAND LASSIE      2,488\r\n  HIGHLAND MARY        2,974\r\n  HIGHLAND SCOT        3,060\r\n  HIGHLAND WATCH       5,500\r\n      TOTAL        57,377 TONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=R. & J. H. Rea.=—In 1872 Mr. Russell Rea (the present M.P. for\r\nthe City of Gloucester), commenced business as a coal merchant in\r\nLiverpool. After a lapse of seven years (1879), he admitted his\r\nbrother, Mr. James Rea, into partnership, and the style of the\r\nfirm was altered to R. & J. H. Rea. The firm own a fleet of five\r\npowerful modern coasting steamers, each having a capacity of about\r\n2,500 tons dead weight, and named respectively the BANGARTH,\r\nCALGARTH, DALEGARTH, GATESGARTH, and THROSTLEGARTH. In addition to\r\nthese vessels, the firm possesses five steam tugs and about 200\r\nlighters. Messrs. R. & J. H. Rea have offices at London, Liverpool,\r\nSouthampton, Bristol and Cardiff.\r\n\r\n\r\n=John S. Sellers.=—Mr. Sellers commenced business as a steamship\r\nowner at Liverpool in the early nineties, the first steamer acquired\r\nby him being the TIMBO. Although for a short time employed as a\r\n“tramp” she was soon placed in a regular general cargo trade, and\r\nduring the past ten years she has maintained, with every satisfaction\r\nto shippers and consignees, the service between Liverpool and\r\nPreston. Mr. Sellers has also established a regular trade between\r\nHarlingen (Holland) and Liverpool, and since early in 1900 he has\r\nbuilt up a regular weekly service between Glasgow and Preston, which\r\nis well served by the THURSBY and other steamers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Henry Tyrer & Co.=—Mr. Henry Tyrer, the sole partner in this firm,\r\ncommenced business in 1878, in Liverpool, and in 1892 opened a branch\r\noffice at Preston. The Albert Edward Dock at Preston, was opened by\r\nthe late Duke of Edinburgh in June of that year, and immediately\r\nafter the opening ceremony, the steamer LADY LOUISA, chartered by\r\nMessrs. Henry Tyrer & Co., commenced discharging, being thus the\r\nfirst steamer to unload in Preston Dock. This firm has continued from\r\nthat date to be closely associated with the steam trade of Preston.\r\nIn 1899 Messrs. Henry Tyrer & Co. built the steamer PRESTONIAN,\r\nthe first steamer to bear that name, shortly afterwards disposing\r\nof her to Messrs. John Bacon, Limited, in whose service she is\r\nstill employed. The following year (1900) Messrs. Henry Tyrer & Co.\r\npurchased the steamship HERMANN, of about 1,300 tons deadweight,\r\nwhich is regularly employed in the firm’s wood pulp trade from Baltic\r\nports. The small steamer PRINCESS was purchased the same year for\r\nemployment in the firm’s regular London and Preston general cargo\r\ntrade. In 1901 the steamer PRESTONIAN, the first, was replaced by a\r\nnew steamer of 1,600 tons deadweight, also named the PRESTONIAN, and\r\nwhich, like the HERMANN, is regularly engaged in the firm’s wood pulp\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nDuring the present year (1903) the firm bought the steamer MINTERNE,\r\nand re-named her the NANCY LEE. She is a large steamer of about 4,750\r\ntons deadweight, and has proved herself to be an excellent sea boat.\r\nA remarkable incident in connection with this ship is, that she has\r\nbeen chartered for six years, to run consecutive voyages between the\r\nSaguenay River (Canada) and the U. K., at a fixed rate of freight\r\ncovering the whole period. In addition to their offices at Liverpool\r\nand Preston, Messrs. Henry Tyrer & Co. have also branch offices at\r\nLondon and Manchester, in connection with their extensive and largely\r\ndeveloping wood pulp trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steamship]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AARON MANBY (1822), first iron steamboat, 39\r\n\r\n  Abbé Arnal and Marquis de Jouffroy (1781), 8\r\n\r\n  ACCOMMODATION, first Canadian steamboat, 9\r\n\r\n  ACHILLES (Holt Line), Remarkable steaming powers of, 136\r\n\r\n  Adelaide Steamship Co., Limited, 315\r\n\r\n  ADRIATIC (Collins Line), 114\r\n\r\n  African Steamship Co., 167\r\n\r\n  ALASKA (Guion Line), 111\r\n\r\n  ALASKA (ex FARRALONES, ex MASSACHUSETTS), 92\r\n\r\n  ALBION (1816), Clyde Steampacket, 29\r\n\r\n  Allan, James (Messrs.
