The\r\nbook has been long familiar to me, and I regard its appearance in an\r\nEnglish dress as an event in our musical history. It will be a great\r\nboon to students and lovers of music, and it shows how much the study\r\nof music has advanced among us when so large and serious a work is\r\nsufficiently appreciated to repay the heavy expense attendant on its\r\ntranslation and publication. The book itself is what the Germans call an\r\n\"epoch-making work.\" The old biographies of musicians, such as Forkel's\r\nLife of Bach (1802) and Dies's of Haydn (1810), are pleasant gossipy\r\naccounts of the outward life of the composers; but they concern\r\nthemselves mainly with the exterior both of the man and his productions,\r\nand there is a sort of tacit understanding throughout that if the reader\r\nis a professional musician he will know all about the music, if he is\r\nan amateur it is altogether out of his reach. Characteristic traits and\r\nanecdotes there are in plenty, but as to how the music was made or came\r\ninto being, what connection existed between it and the circumstances\r\nor surroundings of the composer, what relation it had to that of his\r\npredecessors or contemporaries, how far the art was advanced by the\r\nlabours of this particular composer or player--all that is outside the\r\nprovince of the book. Schindler's Life of Beethoven (Münster, 1840--a\r\nmuch smaller book than it afterwards became) was hardly more\r\n\r\n{PREFACE.}\r\n\r\nthan this, and in addition is so deformed by want of method and by\r\nfaults of style as to be very uninviting to the reader. A step in the\r\nright direction was taken in Moscheles' English translation (or rather\r\nadaptation) of Schindler (1841). Moscheles' residence in London had\r\nshown him that there was even then a public outside the professional\r\nmusician to whom such works would be interesting, and he accordingly\r\ntook pains, by inserting musical examples and other means, to make\r\nhis edition attractive to this class. But the inherent defects of the\r\noriginal work prevented more than a moderate success.\r\n\r\nThe first real attempt at a biography of a composer that should interest\r\nall classes was the work of an Englishman. Edward Holmes was not only a\r\nmusician, but a cultivated man with a good literary style, and his Life\r\nof Mozart, including his Correspondence (1845), was very nearly all that\r\nsuch a book should be. It was derived from original sources, it was full\r\nand yet condensed, it blended admirably the portrait of the man with\r\nthe portrait of the musician, it contained for that time a considerable\r\namount of musical illustrations, and lists of the works; and in addition\r\nto this it was written in a style attractive to the amateur, and even to\r\nthe ordinary reader. It was largely read, and has long since been out\r\nof print.* More than this, it extorted praise from a German writer, and\r\nthat a German should praise any English work on a musical subject is\r\nindeed an event. The terms of warm commendation in which Jahn mentions\r\nit in his introduction are in striking contrast to\r\n\r\n     * A new edition, with notes by Ebenezer Prout, B.A., was\r\n     published in 1878 by Novello, Ewer & Co.\r\n\r\n{PREFACE.}\r\n\r\nthose which he employs over some other German works. He calls it an\r\n\"interesting and readable biography,\" \"a trustworthy and, as far as\r\nwas then possible, exhaustive account... the most trustworthy and\r\nserviceable that could be produced by skilful use of the materials\r\ngenerally accessible\" (pp. ix., x.). In fact, it has been said with\r\ntruth that whole pages may be found in which the two works are so\r\nclosely alike that the one might be thought to be a translation of the\r\nother, the probability being that both Holmes and Jahn were borrowing\r\nfrom the same sources.\r\n\r\nJahn himself enjoyed even higher advantages for his task than Holmes\r\nhad done. He was not only a thorough practical musician, a careful and\r\nsympathetic critic, and a learned musical bibliographer, but he was a\r\nskilled _littérateur_; an adept in philology and archaeology and in\r\nthe history of art and literature; the author of many original works on\r\nthese subjects, and of innumerable editions of the classics, ancient\r\nand modern; and imbued with the true spirit of patient investigation\r\nand accurate research. His position, and the esteem in which he was held\r\nthroughout Germany, gave him command of all the materials necessary for\r\nhis work, even of the most private kind. How he entered on his task,\r\nwith what true modesty and determination he pursued it, from its first\r\nsuggestion, during the funeral of Mendelssohn in 1847, down to\r\nits completion in 1855,* may be seen from his own interesting and\r\ncharacteristic introduction (pp. i.-xxiv), as well as the pains which he\r\ntook to revise his work for the second edition,** twelve years later,\r\n\r\n     * W. A. Mozart, von Otto Jahn (Leipzig, 1856-59). 4 vols.,\r\n     8vo.\r\n\r\n     ** Zwcite durchaos umgearbeitete Auflage (Leipzig, 1867). 2\r\n     vols., royal 8vo.\r\n\r\n{PREFACE.}\r\n\r\nand utilise the additional information acquired in the interval (pp.\r\nxxv.-xxviii.).\r\n\r\nThe book which is the result of this combination of toil, intelligence,\r\nability, knowledge, and affectionate devotion, could only have been\r\nsuccessful by the addition to these qualities of a remarkable amount of\r\nliterary tact and skill. The plan of the work is one which few English\r\nauthors could by any possibility adopt. It is immense; at first sight\r\nits plan is bewildering. The book is not a Life of Mozart so much as\r\nan Encyclopaedia of musical art and biography. It opens with a minute\r\naccount of Mozart's father, and of his method and his works, amounting\r\nto sixteen pages. Not only have we the narrative of the life of Mozart\r\nhimself from his cradle to his grave in the smallest particulars, with\r\na detailed examination of each work--in the case of the operas, both\r\ntext and music, amounting in single operas to forty, fifty, and even\r\nninety pages--but we have the history of the rise and progress of each\r\nbranch of music that Mozart touched--and he touched them all--up to the\r\ndate of his life. Witness the long notices of the Opera, the Oratorio,\r\nand Church music, and the chapter on Instrumental music in Vol. I.; the\r\naccount of the French Opera, and of Lully, Rameau, Gluck, and Piccinni,\r\nin Vol. II. We have also full accounts of the social and musical\r\ncondition of the various cities visited by Mozart, such as Paris,\r\nMannheim, Salzburg, Munich, and Vienna; and biographical notices,\r\nlonger or shorter, of every person with whom Mozart came into contact,\r\nor whom his biographer has occasion to mention.\r\n\r\nSuch a work may well be called an Encyclopaedia; and to have steered\r\nthrough this ocean of material as Jahn has\r\n\r\n{PREFACE.}\r\n\r\ndone, never losing the thread of the narrative, and maintaining the\r\ninterest in the hero throughout, implies no ordinary tact and skill; for\r\nthe book is remarkably readable, and there are few pages which are not\r\nenlivened by some anecdote or lifelike touch. Nor is it less remarkable\r\nfor accuracy than for the other qualities already mentioned. The writer\r\nhas used it constantly for many years, and has never yet discovered\r\na mistake of any moment. Perhaps it would have been better if the\r\nsecondary treatises of which we have spoken had been relegated to\r\nAppendixes; but this is directly opposed to the German method, and we\r\nmust accept the work as we have it. There are indeed already nineteen\r\nAppendixes to the original work, as follows i. Family documents. 2.\r\nMarianne Mozart. 3. Testimonials, eulogistic poems, articles, &c. 4.\r\nDedications. 5. Mozart's letters on his journeys. 6. Text of his church\r\nmusic. 7. Arrangements and adaptations of ditto. 8. His cousins. 9.\r\nMozart as a comic poet. 10. Mozart and Vogler. 11. A letter of Leopold\r\nMozart's. 12. Mozart's letters on the death of his mother. 13. The\r\nchoruses for \"King Thamos.\" 14. The text of \"Idomeneo.\" 15. Alterations\r\nin that opera. 16. Mozart's letters to his wife. 17. The Requiem. 18.\r\nMozart's residences in Vienna. 19. Portraits. Of these it has been\r\nconsidered necessary to retain only Nos. 2, 7, and 19, which form\r\nAppendixes 1, 2, and 3 of the present edition. Another has been added:\r\nnamely, a classified list of the whole of his works, according to the\r\ncomplete edition now in course of publication, with the references to\r\nthe invaluable Catalogue of Köchel. With these exceptions the English\r\ntranslation is exactly in accordance with the German original.\r\n\r\n{PREFACE.}\r\n\r\nA word of special praise is due to Miss Townsend, the translator, who\r\nhas performed her laborious task with great accuracy and intelligence,\r\nand has established an additional claim on the gratitude of the student\r\nby her exhaustive Index, in which the original work is very deficient.\r\n\r\nThe new branch of musical literature, founded by Holmes and Jahn,\r\nalready shows some considerable monuments. Passing by the voluminous and\r\naccurate thematic catalogues of Mozart by the Ritter von Köchel (1862),\r\nof Weber by Jahns (1871), and of Beethoven and Schubert by Nottebohm\r\n(1868 and 1874), works which properly belong to a separate department of\r\nthe subject--we already possess the Life of Handel by Chrysander (vol.\r\ni., 1858; II., 1860; III., 1867), that of Beethoven by A. W. Thayer\r\n(vol. i., 1866; II., 1872; III., 1879), that of Haydn by C. F. Pohl\r\n(vol. i., 1875; II., 1882)--all three still in progress--and that of\r\nBach by Spitta (vol. i., 1873; II., 1880). But these laborious and\r\nconscientious works, while they rival and even surpass Jahn in their\r\nwide range and the manner in which they embalm every minute particular\r\nrelating to the subject, are far behind him in lucidity, and in the ease\r\nwith which he handles his vast materials. In these respects, as might\r\nbe expected from his literary position, Otto Jahn stands hitherto quite\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nGEORGE GROVE.\r\n\r\nFebruary 23, 1882.\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\nTo Professor Gustav Hartenstein.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--I have little doubt that the afternoon of November 7,\r\n1847, is as fresh in your memory as in my own. We had assembled in the\r\nJohan-niskirche to accompany the remains of Mendelssohn on their last\r\nsad journey, and by chance (for I had not been long in Leipzig, and my\r\nacquaintance with you was slight) we walked side by side in the long\r\nline of mourners. From grief at the early loss of a master, whose\r\ncultivation, self-discipline, and endeavours after the good and the\r\nbeautiful had exercised a truly beneficial influence over the art of our\r\nage, our grave talk turned to the more particular consideration of music\r\nin itself, and to the great masters of the past! This led us to the\r\ninterchange of many ideas, and to a conviction of our unanimity of\r\nprinciple and sentiment on most subjects. Thus, for instance, we\r\ncoincided in our experience that at a certain period of our mental\r\ndevelopment Mozart's music had seemed cold and unintelligible to our\r\nrestless spirits, ever soaring into the unknown, and incapable of\r\nappreciating a master whose passions in their workings are not laid bare\r\nto view, but who offers us perfect beauty victorious over turbulence and\r\nimpurity. Turning to him again in later years, we are amazed alike at\r\nthe wondrous wealth of his art, and at our former insensibility to it.\r\nFor my own part, I confided to you how, after severe illness, which had\r\ndebarred me from music for many years, it was Mozart who first gave me\r\ncourage and interest to turn to it again. We agreed, also, that minds\r\nwhich are able to receive and appreciate art for its own sake, must\r\nyield themselves captive to Mozart, but without sacrificing their\r\nfreedom to recognise all that is grand and beautiful elsewhere.\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(ii)\r\n\r\nThis conversation was the beginning of a more constant intercourse,\r\nleading to a friendship founded on such close agreement of principle\r\nin all matters of importance as to render it indissoluble: I have\r\never since, in joy or sorrow, been assured of your hearty sympathy and\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nI should be perfectly justified in offering you this book as a testimony\r\nof my love and gratitude, even if its contents concerned you less. But\r\nmusic has ever played so important a part in our intercourse, whether I\r\nsat beside you at the piano, or stood behind your chair, or we wandered\r\ninto talk; so great a share in the book belongs to you, who have ever\r\nurged me forward with the work, sometimes (I may acknowledge it now)\r\neven unmercifully, that I can offer it in its completed form to none\r\nwith more pleasure and confidence than to yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd now you must give me leave to lay before you much that is on my mind\r\nconcerning it. Let me imagine that I have come as of old to you and your\r\nwife for comfort and encouragement, and prepare for a long talk.\r\n\r\nYou are aware, my dear friend, how this biography originated, and how\r\nit has gradually increased to an extent which has alarmed even myself.\r\nOccupied at first only with the biography of Beethoven, I soon saw that\r\nit would be impossible to do full justice to his great and original\r\ncreations without a clear survey of the life and works of Mozart, the\r\npioneer of the musical future, as whose natural heir Beethoven attained\r\nhis pre-eminent position in the history of music. The exposition would\r\nhave been too comprehensive for an introduction, and I determined to\r\narrange the ill-digested and unreadable mass of biographical material\r\nwhich Nissen had collected into a readable treatise on the life of\r\nMozart, to serve as a foundation for the observations which I meant to\r\ndeduce therefrom. With this end in view, I gradually amassed so large a\r\nstore of materials for the story of his life and the appreciation of his\r\nworks, that there rose before me the duty of erecting a new structure\r\nupon a new foundation. But before I proceed to specify the sources\r\nwhence I have drawn my materials,\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(iii)\r\n\r\nallow me to glance over all the biographies of Mozart hitherto\r\npublished, so far as they are known to me.\r\n\r\nSoon after Mozart's death there appeared a biographical article upon him\r\nin Schlichtegrolls Nekrolog for 1791. This is precise and trustworthy\r\nso far as it relates to the period of his childhood, and rests on\r\nthe testimony of his sister; but the notices of his later years are\r\nsuperficial; and the judgment passed upon him as a man rests upon a\r\npreconceived and unfavourable opinion which then prevailed in Vienna\r\npartly on professional grounds, and which took such deep root that even\r\nat the present day I know not if I shall succeed in establishing the\r\ntruth. It was not surprising that Mozart's widow, in order to stop\r\nthe circulation of such injurious representations, should buy up an\r\nimpression of this article which appeared under the title of Mozart's\r\nLife (Jos. Georg Hubeck: Gratz, 1794).\r\n\r\nA biography which appeared the same year in Sonnleithner's Vienna\r\nTheater-Almanach (p. 94) is only an abridgment of the article in the\r\nNekrolog; and a French translation was made by Beyle, under the _noms de\r\nplume_ of Bombet and Stendhal, as \"Lettres sur Haydn suivies d'une vie\r\nde Mozart\" (Paris, 1814). An English translation of the article appeared\r\nin London, 1817, and a revised French version in Paris, 1817.\r\n\r\nA \"Life of the Imperial Kapellmeister Wolfgang Gottlieb Mozart, compiled\r\nfrom original sources by Franz Niemet-schek\" (Prague, 1798), is founded\r\npartly on communications by the family, especially the widow, partly on\r\npersonal acquaintance with Mozart: I have made use of the second edition\r\nof this work (1808). Unfortunately it does not enter into details so\r\nmuch as might be wished, particularly in its later portions; but all\r\nthat this excellent, well-informed, and devoted friend records of Mozart\r\nis trustworthy and accurate.\r\n\r\nSomething more was to be expected from Friedrich Rochlitz, who busied\r\nhimself for a considerable time in writing a biography of Mozart. He\r\nhad become acquainted with him during his stay in Leipzig in 1789, and\r\nmoving much in musical circles with Doles and Hiller, he was so charmed\r\nwith the genius and amiability of the master,\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(iv)\r\n\r\nthat he even then carefully noted whatever appeared remarkable in their\r\ninterviews.\r\n\r\nWhen he afterwards proposed to prepare a life of Mozart, both the widow\r\nand the sister supplied him with anecdotes and traits of character, and\r\nthe widow further (as I gather from their letters) allowed him to make\r\nuse of Mozart's correspondence.\r\n\r\nSome of the anecdotes and particulars supplied by the widow and sister\r\nor resulting from his own observation were published in the \"Allgemeine\r\nMusikalische Zeitung\" (A.M.Z., Vol. I., pp. 17,49,81,113,145,177,480;\r\nVol. II., pp. 450, 493, 590), and Rochlitz often alluded in later issues\r\nto his acquaintance with Mozart; but there it remained, and I have\r\nfailed to discover why he abandoned his idea of a biography. When\r\nNissen's biography appeared he complained that he had not been called\r\ninto counsel by Mosel, and was of opinion that \"the widow must have\r\nchanged very much in her old age, if she was not proved to have acted\r\nshabbily in this affair\" (Vienna, A.M.Z., 1848, p. 209). I set on foot\r\ninvestigations as to whether Rochlitz had left behind any records or\r\ncommunications which, springing from now exhausted sources, might be of\r\nservice to me in my work. This led to a discovery which, painful as it\r\nis to me to cast a slur on the memory of an otherwise deserving man, I\r\nmust yet, in the interests of truth, reveal; I could not fail to observe\r\nthat those particulars of Mozart's life which Rochlitz gives as the\r\nresult of his own observation or as narrated to him by Mozart, are\r\npeculiar to himself in form and colouring, and that many of the\r\ncircumstances which he relates with absolute certainty are manifestly\r\nuntrue. I sought to account for these facts as slips of memory or\r\nthe result of that kind of self-deception which confounds a logical\r\ninference with a fact springing from it. But my search led to the\r\nfurther discovery of a parallel (also printed in the A.M.Z.) between\r\nMozart and Raphael, giving a detailed account of the circumstances of\r\nMozart's marriage, and with express reference to Mozart's own narrative\r\nof the affair which Rochlitz was supposed to have written down the same\r\nnight. Now for the period which is here treated of, that\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(v)\r\n\r\nis, between 1780 and 1783, Mozart's entire correspondence is preserved,\r\nand any error upon essential points is, as you will readily grant,\r\nimpossible. All the statements of Rochlitz as to time, place, persons,\r\nand events are completely false. You will remember my consternation\r\nat this unwelcome discovery; no poetical license could account for it;\r\nunpleasant as it is, I consider it my duty to expose the affair,\r\npartly that it may teach caution, and partly that tedious and vexatious\r\ndiscussion may be avoided, should the narrative in question ever be\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nThese anecdotes from the A.M.Z., together with the information of\r\nSchlichtegroll and Niemetschek have formed the chief material for the\r\nmore or less complete accounts of Mozart which afterwards appeared; what\r\nwas added consisted partly of anecdotes, generally badly authenticated\r\nand often ill-turned, such as gain currency among artists, and partly of\r\nphrases, or turns of speech which, as Zelter says, every one makes for\r\nhimself. I must not spare you the enumeration of some of the works of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nCramer's \"Anecdotes sur Mozart\" (Paris, 1801), is a mere translation of\r\nthe anecdotes; some of them, together with a general account, are also\r\ngiven by J. B. A. Suard,\r\n\r\n\"Anecdotes sur Mozart,\" in his \"Mélanges de Littérature\", (Paris, 1804),\r\nVol. II., p. 337, as well as by Guattani, in the \"Memorie Enciclopediche\r\nRomane\" (Rome, 1806) Vol. I., pp. 107, 134. A work of more pretension is\r\n\"Mozarts Geist. Seine kurze Biographie und äthetische Darstellung seiner\r\nWerke. Ein Bildungsbuch für junge Tonkünstler\" (Erfurt, 1803). Zelter\r\nasked Goethe to tell him who was the author of this \"short biography\r\nhalf dedicated to Goethe,\" which was \"neither short nor aesthetic, nor a\r\ngood likeness of the man,\" and was not a little surprised to learn that\r\nGoethe knew nothing either of the work or its author (\"Correspondence,\"\r\nVol. I., pp. 56, 67,65). It was, however, by J. E. F. Arnold, of\r\nErfurt, whose subsequent publication, \"Mozart und Haydn. Versuch einer\r\nParallele\" (Erfurt, 1810), was scarcely calculated to draw a more\r\nfavourable expression of opinion from Zelter.\r\n\r\nOf no greater intrinsic value are Hormayr's statements:\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(vi)\r\n\r\nin the \"Austrian Plutarch\" (VII., 2, 15; Vienna, 1807), or Lichtenthal's\r\n\"Cenni biografici intorno al celebre Maestro Wolfgango Amadeo Mozart\"\r\n(Milan, 1816). I have not been able to procure the \"Elogio' storico\r\ndi Mozart del Conte Schizzi\" (Cremona, 1817). The articles in Gerber's\r\n\"Tonkünstlerlexicon\" are carefully compiled, but not complete; and\r\n\"Mozarts Biographie,\" by J. A. Schlosser (Prague, 1828; third edition,\r\n1844), is a compilation altogether wanting in judgment.\r\n\r\nAn unsuspected wealth of fresh resources was brought to light by the\r\n\"Biographie W. A. Mozarts,\" by G. N. v. Nissen. Leipzig, 1828 (with an\r\nappendix). In order to estimate this book justly, and to make a right\r\nuse of it, it is necessary to ascertain how and whence it proceeded, a\r\ntask of considerably more difficulty than merely mocking and railing at\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNissen, who came to Vienna, after Mozart's death, as a Danish\r\ndiplomatist, became acquainted with his widow, and interested himself in\r\nher unprotected condition. He had a great turn for business matters, and\r\nwas fond of arranging papers, writing letters, and even copying, without\r\nunderstanding what it was that he was occupied about. He therefore\r\nwillingly undertook to put Mozart's effects in order, to assist\r\nthe widow in all her business arrangements, and to carry on her\r\ncorrespondence. A long series of letters which he wrote in her name\r\nshow him to have been a well-meaning, sensible man, somewhat\r\nover-circumstantial in his style of writing. After his marriage with\r\nMozart's widow he felt it his duty to labour with the same conscientious\r\ncare for his memory as he had formerly done for his property, and\r\nhe employed the leisure of his remaining years, which were spent at\r\nSalzburg, in carrying out this design.\r\n\r\nWe ought to own ourselves deeply indebted to him, for without his care\r\nthe most important documents and traditions would have been hopelessly\r\nlost. Mozart's sister was then living at Salzburg; her recollections,\r\nand those of his wife, afforded an abundance of characteristic traits,\r\nand the carefully preserved papers and family correspondence, were a\r\nrich mine of authentic documents.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n(vii)\r\n\r\nBesides a number of separate deeds, letters, and memoranda, he had at\r\nhis disposal: Leopold Mozart's letters to Hagenauer during the journey\r\nto Vienna (September, 1762, to January, 1763); during the great\r\njourney (from June, 1763, to November, 1766); during the Vienna journey\r\n(September, 1767, to December, 1768); letters both of the father and son\r\nto their family during the Italian journey (December, 1769, to March,\r\n1771; from August 13, 1771, to December, 1771; from October, 1772, to\r\nMarch, 1773); from Vienna (July, 1773, to September, 1773); from Munich\r\n(December, 1774, to March, 1775); Wolfgang's and his mother's letters\r\nhome, together with the answers of Leopold and his daughter during\r\nthe journey to Paris (September, 1777, to January, 1779); Wolfgang's\r\ncorrespondence with his father and sister during his journey to Munich\r\nand residence in Vienna. Wolfgang's letters come down to 1784, his\r\nfather's to 1781.\r\n\r\nNissen possessed both the industry and the goodwill to turn these\r\ntreasures to account; unhappily these qualities do not suffice for such\r\nan undertaking. Not to mention that he has no idea of adaptation or of\r\ndescription, he had neither taste nor cultivation in music, nor tact to\r\ndistinguish what was trivial from what was important; nor was he capable\r\nof accurately conveying an idea. Having had at my service a portion of\r\nthe documents made use of by him, I have been able to check him, and\r\nto form an idea of his mode of proceeding. He is never dishonest, never\r\nalters with intent to deceive; but he deals with his documents in the\r\nmost summary manner possible. He seldom gives them entire, but only so\r\nmuch of them as he considers of interest. Unfortunately he is no judge\r\neither of what is musically important nor psychologically interesting,\r\nand thus his selection is often singularly unhappy. He was influenced,\r\ntoo, by consideration for distinguished living personages, and by the\r\nprejudices of his wife, who naturally wished many family circumstances\r\nto remain untouched; his sins, however, are always those of omission.\r\nBut silence, by obscuring the connection of events, and by concealing\r\nthe motives of actions, may be as prejudicial as actual\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(viii)\r\n\r\nmisstatement to historical accuracy, and the sufferer by a too tender\r\nconsideration for the feelings of others is invariably the person whose\r\ncharacter it is attempted to depict. Fortunately, for the most important\r\nyears of Mozart's life from 1777 onwards, I have been able myself to\r\nmake use of the family correspondence; you will see what a different\r\nconception I have thereby been enabled to form of this period. It is of\r\nless importance, but nevertheless a drawback, that Nissen has thought\r\ngood to alter the details of style and expression in many of the\r\nletters. Neither father nor son were in need of such emendations, both\r\nwriting clearly and shrewdly, and with an individuality all their own;\r\nbut even were this not the case, and Nissen the man (which he was not)\r\nto correct their defects, such an effacement of individual character\r\nwould remain altogether inexcusable.\r\n\r\nHad Nissen confined himself to the publication of the letters and\r\nextracts, together with such information as he could gather from\r\nMozart's wife and sister, or from other credible witnesses, he would\r\nhave done posterity important service. But in attempting more than this\r\nhe verified the saying of Hesiod that \"the whole is less than the\r\npart.\" Many manuscripts, newspapers, journals, &c., treating of Mozart's\r\nprofessional doings, had been preserved among the family archives;\r\nnot content with these, Nissen has taken incredible pains to collect\r\nwhatever else had been written concerning Mozart; he has then copied\r\nout all that appeared to him important, and has arranged these extracts\r\ncategorically as seemed to him good, putting together, for instance, all\r\nthat related to one particular work; finally, he has huddled\r\ntogether these heterogeneous fragments without design, connection, or\r\nexplanation. If this confused and ill-proportioned mass is to be made\r\nuse of at all, it must be separated into its component parts, and these\r\nmust be restored to their proper place and connection; it may fairly be\r\ntaken for granted that where any idea or judgment is expressed, Nissen\r\nis not speaking in his own person. He has, however, simplified the task\r\nof restoring each fragment to its proper position by a catalogue of the\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(ix)\r\n\r\nwritings in which Mozart is mentioned; and although some documents made\r\nuse of by him have since disappeared,\r\n\r\nI have been able in almost every case to discover his authorities. In\r\nmost cases these are of little value; but among much that is worthless,\r\nthere are here and there communications resting on family traditions,\r\nwhich Nissen has tacitly appropriated with but slight alterations; it\r\nis undoubtedly desirable to be able to appeal to the original in such\r\ncases, but for the most part they speak for themselves, and are seldom\r\nof importance.\r\n\r\nThe statements I have made were necessary for the proper use of Nissen's\r\nwork; but you must not, therefore, imagine that I am unjust towards\r\nhim. True the mass of printed matter is enough to drive one to absolute\r\ndespair; but when it is remembered that a large proportion of the\r\ndocuments he embodies have since dissappeared, we must be grateful to\r\nthe man who has enabled us to take so comprehensive a glance into\r\nan artist's life, and who has laboured with unselfish reverence for\r\nMozart's memory, while a succeeding generation did not think it worth\r\nwhile even to preserve the documents which Nissen made use of.\r\n\r\nIt must not be lost sight of either, that Nissen did not see his work\r\nthrough the press; he died on March 24, 1826, before it was put in hand,\r\nand it is quite possible that he would have improved it in many ways\r\nupon final revision.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that although all were agreed that Nissen's book\r\nwas unreadable without alteration and adaptation, no writer in Germany\r\nundertook the task, and that it was left to foreigners to turn the\r\ntreasure to account. Fétis undertook\r\n\r\nit in his \"Biographie Universelle des Musiciens,\" IV., p. 432 (Brussels,\r\n1840), VI., p. 222 (2nd edit., Brussels, 1864), so far as it could be\r\ndone within the narrow limits of a general work of the kind.\r\n\r\nBut the obvious task of compiling an interesting and readable biography\r\nby means of an orderly arrangement of the really interesting portions of\r\nNissen's materials was first undertaken by Edward Holmes, in his \"Life\r\nof Mozart, including his Correspondence\" (London, 1845).\r\n\r\nHolmes has arranged the essential portions of the\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(x)\r\n\r\ncorrespondence with intelligence and discrimination, and has connected them\r\nby a narrative built upon previous notices; he has thus produced a\r\ntrustworthy and, as far as was possible, an exhaustive account of\r\nMozart's life. Holmes has, moreover, made use of André's published\r\nCatalogue of Mozart's Works, and the indications there given of their\r\ndate of appearance. He undertook a journey through Germany to inspect\r\nthe original manuscripts in André's possession, and to collect stray\r\noral traditions. He took care to make himself acquainted with musical\r\nliterature, and the result is a work which must be considered as the\r\nmost trustworthy and serviceable biography that could be produced by a\r\nskilful employment of the materials generally accessible. Holmes has not\r\nattempted to draw from hitherto unknown sources; he neither carries\r\nhis researches to any depth, nor offers any original opinions or\r\nexplanations.\r\n\r\nThe letters of both Mozarts, father and son, were edited by J. Goschler\r\nin a spirit which is indicated clearly enough by the title of his book,\r\n\"Mozart; Vie d'un Artiste Chrétien au XVIII. siècle.\" Paris, 1857.\r\n\r\nAlexander Ulibichefï proceeded from quite another point of view in his\r\nwork, \"Nouvelle Biographie de Mozart, suivie d'un aperçu sur l'histoire\r\ngénérale de la musique, et de l'analyse des principales ouvres de\r\nMozart\" (Moscow, 1843), in three parts, which is generally known in\r\nGermany in the translations of A. Schraishuon (Stuttgart, 1847), and of\r\nL. Gantte (Stuttgart, 1859). The enthusiastic reverence of the author\r\nfor Mozart speaks from every page, and involved many years of study and\r\nmany real sacrifices; but this must not blind our judgment as to the\r\nintrinsic value of his work. I do not fear your reproaching me in\r\nthe words of the old proverb about the kettle reproving the pot, if\r\nI express myself freely as to what I consider the weak points of this\r\nbook. Ulibicheffs main object has been a critical and aesthetic analysis\r\nof Mozart's later works, on which his fame mainly rests, and which\r\nbear the most perfect impress of his genius. The author's\r\nobservations, therefore, are confined to a definite portion of Mozart's\r\ncompositions--the best known, because the greatest--and any idea of\r\nextending\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(xi)\r\n\r\nthem does not seem to have occurred to him. Anything further in his\r\nworks is meant to serve only as a foundation for those observations.\r\nHe does not fail to perceive that the greatness of perfected genius\r\ncan only be apprehended by a knowledge of the gradual stages of its\r\nachievement, and that, since Mozart takes his place in the history of\r\nmusic by something more than mere chance, the whole process of musical\r\ndevelopment is necessarily incorporated in his progress.\r\n\r\nUlibicheff is content to extract all that seems to point to his\r\nconclusions from Nissen's account of Mozart's development. He makes up\r\nfor his reticence in this direction by expatiating freely on the general\r\nhistory of the art. In fact, his review of the whole history of music\r\nresults only in the observation that since any exceptional phenomenon is\r\nthe sum and crown of all that has gone before, therefore the development\r\nof modern music in every direction, from Guido of Arezzo, onwards, has\r\nits _raison d'etre_ in the production of Mozart, who is to be considered\r\nas its perfect expression.\r\n\r\nNo one knows better than yourself, my friend, the false conclusions to\r\nwhich this exaggeration of an idea, true and suggestive in itself, has\r\nled. The partiality of enthusiasm and dilettantism join issue here. It\r\nneeds no great penetration to discover that Ulibicheffs epitome of\r\nthe history of music is not the result of impartial research, or of a\r\npractical knowledge of even the more important works of past ages, but\r\nthat it is compiled from a few easily recognised works with the express\r\nobject of demonstrating that all that has gone before has its end and\r\nconsummation in Mozart. An author who can seriously maintain that the\r\ngreat masters of counterpoint, Palestrina, Bach, and Handel were only\r\ncalled into being in order that the Requiem might be produced, an author\r\nwho can only grasp and develop the idea of natural progress up to a\r\ncertain point and no further--that author has surely mastered neither\r\nthe idea of progress, nor the nature of the art, nor the work of\r\nthe master whom he seeks to honour. Such a partial and exclusive\r\nappreciation of any artist may satisfy individual taste, for which it is\r\nproverbially impossible to account; but scientific investigation,\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(xii)\r\n\r\nwhich can always be accounted for, seeing that it proceeds from a\r\nrational basis, rejects it at once and altogether. You will, I know,\r\nagree with me that the critic who, like Ulibicheff, depreciates\r\nBeethoven in order to maintain Mozart on his pedestal, does not\r\nunderstand Mozart. The distortion and exaggeration of such an idea\r\nleads further to the neglect of those clues to a right understanding of\r\nMozart's development which exist in the circumstances of his life, in\r\nhis youthful works, and in the conditions of his age and surroundings.\r\nThese had all direct effect upon his genius, and, in so far as they are\r\ndisregarded, our conception of the man and the artist will be defective.\r\n\r\nI am, of course, far from denying that Uübicheff has brought to the\r\nperformance of his task considerable power of delicate aesthetic\r\nanalysis, together with much spirit and ingenuity. But his analysis of\r\nparticular works does not start from artistic form, the specific basis\r\nof all works of art; he never seeks to demonstrate how the universal\r\nlaws of art, under certain conditions, govern all concrete forms\r\naccording to the individuality of the artist (a difficult task in music,\r\nbut still essential to its true understanding); instead of this he\r\ncontents himself with giving us his own reflections on the various\r\ncompositions he analyses, and the feelings and ideas which they suggest\r\nto himself. Such reflections are pleasant and entertaining when they\r\nproceed from a clever and cultivated mind; but they are usually more\r\ncharacteristic of the author than of his subject, and are mainly\r\nsatisfactory to those who fail to grasp the substance of a work of art,\r\nand are fain to content themselves with its shadow.\r\n\r\nUübicheff invariably displays both intellect and cultivation, but it is\r\nthe cultivation of a man of the world, not that of a musician, which has\r\nno bias of enthusiasm or dilettantism; his remarks seldom reach the\r\nroot of the matter, and are often deceptive in their brilliancy, thus\r\naccomplishing little for a better appreciation of his subject.\r\n\r\nDo not be alarmed, my dear friend, at the invidious position in which I\r\nplace myself and my work by my want of reserve as to others. My cause\r\nis that of knowledge, and I must have a clear understanding as to my\r\npowers,\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(xiii)\r\n\r\nand the means at my disposal, for accomplishing the task before me;\r\nleast of all would I appear to deprecate censure on my own work by\r\nsparing it to that of others. You are aware that music has, from my\r\nyouth up, occupied a large share of my time and thoughts, so much so,\r\nthat my elders were in the habit of shaking their heads and auguring\r\nill for my philological studies. They may have been right; I must at any\r\nrate acknowledge that music has ever been to me quite as serious a study\r\nas philology, and that I have striven to acquire such a thorough and\r\nscientific knowledge as should give me an insight into its nature and\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\nI considered it therefore as a duty to myself to turn to account the\r\nlabour that had occupied a good share of my life, and I embraced with\r\neagerness the opportunity of dedicating my researches to the great\r\nmasters, to whom I owed so much. I believed myself justified in\r\nconsidering that a representation of the life and works of a great\r\nmaster offers so many sides, and makes so many demands, that only united\r\nforces can prove themselves fully equal to the task. If, therefore, I\r\nwas obliged, perforce, to leave much that was essential to the musician\r\nby profession, my greater practice in scientific method might advance\r\nthe undertaking in other and not less important directions. Consoled by\r\nthese reflections, I set to work.\r\n\r\nThe task I proposed to myself was a thorough investigation of the\r\nsources available for a trustworthy and exhaustive account of Mozart's\r\nlife, with special reference to all that was calculated to affect his\r\nmoral and musical development in the general conditions of his time, and\r\nin the local and personal circumstances which influenced him; and,\r\nin addition, a history of his development as an artist, and a\r\ncharacterisation of his artistic performances as comprehensive as a\r\nthorough study and appreciation of his compositions could make it. No\r\nside of this task could be treated altogether independently, both the\r\nresearches and the remarks resulting from them, touching now one, now\r\nthe other; in the biography as in the individual, the artist and the man\r\nare indissolubly united\r\n\r\nI soon became painfully aware of the insufficiency of my\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(xiv)\r\n\r\nmaterials, and the scattered additions to Nissen's collection which\r\ncame in from time to time were but scanty gleanings; it was essential to\r\nreach the original sources. My journey to Vienna in 1852 was undertaken,\r\nas you know, chiefly with the object of collecting such traditions of\r\nBeethoven as might remain there; I did not hope to find much which might\r\nlead to a closer knowledge of Mozart.\r\n\r\nLiving testimony as to his life, person, or circumstances was almost\r\nextinct, little of what I learnt was from impressions at first hand, and\r\nit was generally necessary to guard against such communications as the\r\nresult of book knowledge distorted by verbal transmission.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, my visit was an instructive one even as concerned Mozart.\r\nWidely different as was the Vienna of 1852 from the Vienna of 1780 to\r\n1790, yet much was gained by actual observation and impressions, which\r\ncould not be given by books, and which operates more in the colour and\r\ntone of the whole representation that in any precise details.\r\n\r\nIntercourse, also, with accomplished friends led to much which would\r\notherwise have remained untouched.\r\n\r\nMy valued friend Karajan in particular, with his musical knowledge and\r\nhis intimate acquaintance with Vienna, rendered my stay in that city\r\nas instructive as it was agreeable. He had a good opportunity of\r\nexperiencing how much trouble one is capable of giving to a friend who\r\nis always ready with explanations, and willing to enter on the driest\r\nsearch into matters of detail, if he can thereby help forward another.\r\nAt the Imperial Library I found not only the different manuscripts of\r\nthe Requiem which serve as the surest testimony on the much debated\r\nquestion of its authorship, but many other important manuscripts and\r\nrich material of all kinds, my access to which I owe to the unfailing\r\ncourtesy of the custodian, A. Schmid.\r\n\r\nBut the most important aid came from Aloys Fuchs. With extraordinary\r\nperseverance he had collected every writing that in any way related to\r\nMozart, and with a disinterested liberality, rare among collectors, he\r\nplaced at my service all that he possessed and all that he knew.\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(xv)\r\n\r\nHis chronological catalogue of all Mozart's works, published and\r\nunpublished, was of the greatest service to me, as well as the long list\r\nof documents, newspapers, journals, and pamphlets, which he had either\r\nin the original or copies.\r\n\r\nI sometimes regretted, however, that the collection was made more in\r\nthe spirit of a collector than in the interests of science; so that, for\r\nexample, he has scarcely ever noted the source of his extracts; but much\r\nwas brought to my notice which would scarcely otherwise have occurred to\r\nme, much trouble was spared, and a number of Mozart's letters were\r\nmade known to me for the first time. I was unfortunately prevented\r\nfrom thoroughly examining Fuchs's valuable collection of Mozart's\r\ncompositions in their different editions and copies; my time was short,\r\nand I hoped to be able to avail myself of a future opportunity for doing\r\nso. This hope was frustrated by the death of Aloys Fuchs a few months\r\nafter I left Vienna. It has been a painful feeling to me not to be able\r\nto express my gratitude for so much friendly service by offering to him\r\nthe book in which I know he would have taken pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe greatest service which he rendered me, however, was the intelligence\r\nthat all that were preserved of Mozart's letters had been presented to\r\nthe Mozarteum in Salzburg by the Frau Baroni-Cavalcabo, to whom they\r\nwere bequeathed by Mozart's son Wolfgang. In November of the same year I\r\nrepaired, therefore, to Salzburg. I here found the only remains of\r\nthat complete correspondence which Nissen had edited, viz., the letters\r\nbetween 1777 and 1784, just as he had made use of them; fortunately they\r\nembraced the most important period of the biography. A cursory glance\r\nconvinced me that Nissen had been not only inexact and arbitrary in his\r\nselections in matters of detail, but that he had altogether suppressed\r\nthe most important events affecting the proper understanding of the\r\nperiod. Here, then was much to be done; but it was richly worth the\r\ntrouble. Through the kind assistance of the secretary of the Mozarteum,\r\nDr. v. Hilleprandt, and of the custodian, Jelinek, I was enabled to\r\ngive my whole attention to the work. I collated the letters printed by\r\nNissen, like an\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(xvi)\r\n\r\nold schoolman, copying them entire or making voluminous extracts. One\r\nmay boast of one's industry, and I can offer an unimpeachable witness of\r\nmine in old Theresa at the Golden Ox, who afterwards forgot my name, but\r\nremembered me as the professor who sat in his room for more than three\r\nweeks writing from morning to night. Fortunately, it was bad weather, or\r\nit would have been too hard a trial, even for a professor, to sit in his\r\nroom all day at Salzburg. But the usually hateful task of transcription\r\nwas on this occasion a real enjoyment. I could fancy myself in\r\nintercourse with the man himself as I lived his life again letter by\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nI could realise the emotions of joy or sorrow which had prompted his\r\nwords, the impressions which they had made on the recipients, and even\r\nthe variations in the handwriting grew to have their own significance.\r\nIt is my most earnest wish that some breath of this feeling may have\r\npassed into my own performance, but it would scarcely be possible\r\nto' reproduce the inspiration which contact with the letters awoke in\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nOn the completion of this task, I made researches for any of Mozart's\r\ncompositions which might still remain in Salzburg; I failed, however,\r\nto discover any. Although Mozart's sister, his widow, and her sister had\r\nlived in Salzburg within the last ten years, it had occurred to no one\r\nto make inquiries concerning their great countryman, or to preserve to\r\nposterity the rich treasures of family tradition which encircled\r\nhis whole life; I found, when I inquired, that all was as completely\r\nforgotten, as irrecoverably lost as his grave. Nor had anything further\r\nbeen preserved in the way of family papers and documents. (After\r\nthe death of Mozart's eldest son Carl, all that he possessed of\r\nletters--written during the journeys of 1762 to 1775--and other\r\ndocuments, were placed in the Mozarteum.)\r\n\r\nTreasure such as that correspondence I could scarcely expect to excavate\r\nelsewhere; but through the kindness of friends and well-wishers\r\nmany letters have been placed at my disposal which have added to the\r\ninterest, more particularly of Mozart's later years. I have no doubt\r\nthat many\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(xvii)\r\n\r\ndocuments are still hidden in autograph collections and elsewhere;\r\nperchance my book may open the eyes of the possessors to the true value\r\nof their treasures, and I shall consider it as a rich reward of my\r\nlabours if they aid in bringing to light any such relics of Mozart.\r\n\r\nAssistance of another kind, not less important than the foregoing,\r\ncame from André's collection. It is well known; that the Hofrath André\r\npurchased from Mozart's widow the entire collection of Mozart's original\r\nmanuscripts, of printed and unprinted works, and this collection,\r\nwith the exception of a few pieces disposed of at an earlier date, was\r\npreserved in Frankfort entire, in the possession of André's heirs, as\r\ndenoted by a \"Thematic Catalogue of the original manuscripts by Mozart\r\nin the possession of Hofrath André\" (Offenbach, 1841). Leopold Mozart\r\ncarefully preserved all Wolfgang's youthful works, and at his death they\r\ncame into the son's possession: although not by any means so careless\r\nabout his compositions as he has been represented, he, nevertheless,\r\nlost or gave away a considerable number. After his death, however, it\r\nwas found that his works previous to his residence in Vienna had been\r\npreserved almost entire, and by far the greater number of those of later\r\nyears. André's collection contains further the enumeration, in Mozart's\r\nown handwriting, of his works from his earliest years in almost unbroken\r\nsuccession to his death. The more important and greater number of his\r\ncompositions previous to 1780 are still unprinted, and many of the\r\nprinted ones are so carelessly edited that a comparison with the\r\noriginal is indispensable. The importance of André's collection is\r\nmanifest, and it is probable that none of equal value, historical\r\nand artistic, exists for any other great master, whatever be his art.\r\n(Unhappily, the apprehension that Germany could conceive no worthier or\r\nmore lasting way of honouring Mozart than by the erection of statues and\r\nbusts has been fulfilled, and Mozart's manuscripts have already been in\r\ngreat measure dispersed.)\r\n\r\nConvinced that a review of Mozart's musical development would be\r\nimpossible without an exhaustive knowledge of his youthful works, I\r\nrepaired to Frankfort in the summer\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(xviii)\r\n\r\nof 1853, in order to examine this remarkable collection. The brothers\r\nCarl and Julius André granted me ready access to it, and kindly prepared\r\nme an apartment in their house, where I had full liberty to study the\r\nMSS. and make what notes and extracts I pleased; a task which occupied\r\nfive weeks. As it proceeded, I could not but feel that the most accurate\r\nnotices could not give the fresh impression of the actual work. Here\r\nagain, the brothers André came to my aid, displaying throughout a warmth\r\nof interest in my work, and a liberality which I could not have ventured\r\nto expect; they provided me, as my work progressed, with each particular\r\nmanuscript on which I was engaged, so that my remarks could be grounded\r\non the actual examination of every composition. Without the confidence\r\nand aid of these gentlemen, my book could not have succeeded in\r\nattaining that wherein I place its essential value. It is owing to\r\ntheir courtesy and kindness that I may boast, not only of a perfect\r\nacquaintance with all Mozart's works, with few and unimportant\r\nexceptions, but also of having enjoyed the singular happiness and\r\nadvantage of studying the greater number of them in his own handwriting.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive, my dear friend, that all this led, of necessity, to\r\nfresh disclosures, to a fuller and more accurate insight into that which\r\nhad hitherto been only partially known; and you will further take for\r\ngranted that I, as a \"philolog,\" would not neglect such researches into\r\nthe literature of my subject as should bring together the scattered\r\nmaterials available for my task. But you must keep in mind that\r\nmusical literature is not so accessible as philological; and that many\r\nexpedients, which lighten our labours in the latter path, are wholly\r\nwanting in the former. I am, therefore, far from flattering myself that\r\nI have even approached a complete study of the literature of my subject.\r\nI only aimed at such a study so far as it concerned main principles; for\r\nto become acquainted with, or even to quote, everything that has been\r\nthought, dreamt, or raved concerning Mozart's music was as far from my\r\nintention as from my desire. I was more than satisfied with what came in\r\nmy way of this kind in the course of my reading, and my\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(xix)\r\n\r\nreaders will be more than satisfied with what I offer them of it by way\r\nof example.\r\n\r\nMy first aim, then, was the verification and authentication of facts,\r\nand their unbiassed statement, so far as this was of interest. The\r\nwritten or authentic verbal traditions of Mozart and his family were\r\nhere my chief dependence, and, except where some special authority is\r\nadduced, Nissen's correspondence forms the basis of my narrative. But\r\nsince it was my wish to bring together all that appeared of lasting\r\ninterest, and to dispense with Nissen's collection, for all readers who\r\ndo not desire to search and prove for themselves, I have, therefore,\r\nquoted verbally from the letters wherever it was feasible, and have\r\nnot hesitated to displace them where it answered my purpose in the\r\nnarrative. I have in every case indicated the letters by their date,\r\nwithout mentioning whether they have been printed by Nissen or not.\r\n(They may be readily referred to in the careful collection of L. Nohl,\r\n\"Mozarts Briefe\": Salzburg, 1865.)\r\n\r\nI must remark, by the way, that my version cannot be verified by Nissen,\r\nsince his is neither accurate nor entire; and in order to avoid any\r\nmisunderstanding, I may also mention, that besides the collections\r\nreferred to above, many single letters of Leopold and Wolfgang Mozart\r\nhave come to hand, to which I was able to make more exact reference. As\r\na matter of course, I have made use of originals whenever they were to\r\nbe had, and of Nissen's version only when they were wanting. From you,\r\nmy dear friend, I need only request confidence in my scrupulous honesty\r\nas to these matters, and I have hope that my book may inspire the reader\r\nwith a belief in the accuracy of my rendering. It need scarcely be\r\nsaid that I have not made the slightest alteration in the style and\r\nexpressions of the letters. I have only taken a few liberties with\r\nthe orthography in order not to distract the reader's attention\r\nunnecessarily from the characterisation. I have accurately indicated any\r\nreference to authorities other than the letters.\r\n\r\nIt has been my aim to represent, not only what immediately concerns\r\nMozart, but also the time in which he lived, his circumstances, and the\r\npersons with whom he came in\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(xx)\r\n\r\ncontact, so far as all these affected the development of his genius. And\r\nhere again I found the need of trustworthy information. Well informed\r\nas we may be on the history of literature and culture during the latter\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century, yet our information as to musical events\r\nand persons is meagre and obscure, and we know least of those regions\r\nwhich are of the greatest interest in the history of music. I doubt not\r\nthat an historian, occupied with the study of this age, would discover\r\nmuch that has escaped me of interest, although I have heard even such\r\ncomplain of the poverty of material.\r\n\r\nI have striven with a certain amount of zeal to bring together all that\r\nappeared to render my narrative more graphic and lifelike, and have not\r\nrefrained from adducing my authorities, partly for the sake of accuracy,\r\npartly to point the way to those who find the subject of interest. I\r\nhave gone even further than this, and have added to the names of many\r\npersons, principally musicians, of whom mention had to be made, a short\r\nnotice of their life and sometimes an epitome of their performances. It\r\nis probable that the minority of my readers will already have such facts\r\nin their minds, and they are essential to a clear perception of the\r\nwhole work: I have been anxious to spare them the trouble of continual\r\nreference to a biographical dictionary.\r\n\r\nI have confined myself to the accessible and, of its kind, excellent\r\nDictionary of Musicians by Gerber and Fétis, but my own investigations,\r\nleading me into the detailed history of this time, have not seldom\r\nsupplied additional data for such notices; I remark this not to\r\ndepreciate the merit of those works, but that it may not be supposed\r\nthat my statements can always be verified by a reference to accessible\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nYou may perhaps smile at the zeal of the \"philolog\" betraying itself in\r\nsuch minute particulars. Be it so. I hold to my craft, and occasionally\r\nyou will not find it amiss that I do so.\r\n\r\nI may remark besides, not to you, but to those who hold in horror notes,\r\ndigressions, quotations, and references as the merciless weapons of\r\npedantry, that they need not for this\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(xxi)\r\n\r\nreason at once reject my book. I have striven so to write that the text\r\nis complete in itself and requires no notes for its comprehension; and\r\nthose who do not desire the information they contain, may contentedly\r\npass them over. On the other hand, I hope that you will uphold my\r\nopinion that the application of the scientific method even to these\r\nresearches, cannot but be to their advantage. This is perhaps most\r\nstrikingly evident in the chronological notification of each separate\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWe are well supplied with chronological information as to Mozart's\r\ncompositions. From 1784 onwards we possess his own carefully compiled\r\nthematic catalogue which André has edited (Offenbach, 1805 and 1828).\r\n\r\nOn earlier compositions the data is generally correctly given with the\r\nautograph signature, and the list of authentically dated works comprises\r\nby far their greater number. But not quite all; the autograph is wanting\r\nto many, and they are not all dated. It thus becomes necessary to\r\nresort to classification resting on the external evidence of paper and\r\nhandwriting, and the internal evidence of style and technical treatment,\r\nas well as on the testimony of witnesses.\r\n\r\nHofrath André compiled for his own use a chronological catalogue coming\r\ndown to the year 1784, of which I have made use. It contains many\r\nsuggestive remarks, and did me good service, although, of course, it\r\ncould not spare me my own investigations, by means of which I have, in\r\nmost cases, come to a solution of my difficulties. The catalogue which I\r\nhave compiled with considerable pains will, I hope, recommend itself by\r\nits brevity, clearness, and trustworthiness. I was obliged to give up\r\nthe idea of noting what had been already printed, where, and how often;\r\nto do this with completeness and exactitude would require an amount of\r\ntime and study which it was out of my power to bestow.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of historical facts, both in detail and as a whole, has\r\nits own secure and beaten path. Its final object is truth, and my sole\r\nconcern has been to discover and set forth the truth. No consideration\r\nfor others has led me to conceal what was essential or important for the\r\ndue understanding of Mozart as a man and an artist; neither have I\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(xxii)\r\n\r\nbeen tempted to silence on points which were to his disadvantage.\r\nPublic opinion on his achievements as a fully developed artist is firmly\r\nestablished, and is perhaps only susceptible of modifications of detail\r\nand degree; but my work is the first attempt that has been made towards\r\na correct judgment of Mozart as a student and as a man. It has been a\r\npleasure to me to find that as I proceeded, my admiration, esteem, and\r\nlove for Mozart were constantly on the increase; but not on any account\r\nwould I have my representation of his character considered in the light\r\nof an apology. It is my firm conviction that injustice is done to great\r\nmen by concealing or slurring over their failings; we serve them best by\r\nseeking to make them understood just as they were.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to lay Mozart's individuality before the reader seemed hardly\r\ncomplete without some presentation of his outward appearance. You will\r\nfind, therefore, in this book, the charming picture of Mozart as a boy,\r\nengraved from the portrait in oils, painted in Verona in 1770; also\r\nthe characteristic portrait from the family group in the Mo-zarteum at\r\nSalzburg, which was painted in 1780, and an engraving of Tischbein's\r\nportrait, painted at Mayence in 1790. I have thought it right, further,\r\nin a work which is intended to transmit traditions, to preserve the\r\nwell-known profile of Posch's medallion, which served as a model for\r\nall early portraits, more and more unlike in every copy, and yet always\r\nlike. Various fac-similes of Mozart's handwriting are also given, and\r\nI do not fear that you will find out of place a portrait of his father,\r\nalso taken from the Salzburg family picture.\r\n\r\nMay I add one word on the musical criticism contained in my work? I am\r\nquite aware that it must stand on its own merits, and I am only anxious\r\nto express my full consciousness of the difficulty of my undertaking.\r\nThat the substance of a musical work cannot be verbally represented,\r\nand that its effect on the hearer is incapable of being reproduced\r\nby description, least of all by a climax of high-sounding adjectives,\r\nadmits of no dispute. Properly speaking, as Schumann once wished for the\r\nmusical critic, when a\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(xxiii)\r\n\r\ncomposition is discussed, there should be singers and instrumentalists\r\nready at hand to perform it. But this being scarcely feasible, we are\r\ndriven to a verbal attempt at reproducing the essence of the work. Such\r\nan attempt can only succeed by starting from artistic form, and\r\nshowing how its laws and types, its technical conditions, its manifold\r\napplication and development, are all represented in the most individual\r\nmodifications. A general idea of the work, however, is all that can be\r\narrived at by this means; the immediate impressions made upon the mind\r\nby its performance cannot be reproduced; neither can the attempt to\r\nexpress in words the artistic frame of mind which finds its expression\r\nin the forms of the work be altogether successful, and it is impossible\r\nto apprehend the degree in which the artistic mood imbues the artistic\r\nform otherwise than by observation of the work itself.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of musical works, therefore, since music cannot, like\r\npainting, borrow analogies from visible nature, must remain mere\r\napproximations of the original; they become more definite in proportion\r\nas they fall in with the reader's own experiences, and find in these\r\nanalogies and, as it were, precedents for the new ideas it is sought\r\nto convey. The main difficulty consists in the fact that among a large\r\ncircle of readers (which I know you wish for me) the degrees of musical\r\ncultivation to which appeal may be made are necessarily very varied. It\r\nwould be impossible, on this account, to treat the subject in the purely\r\ntechnical manner which would be the shortest and most convenient were\r\nmusicians only addressed; neither can every separate point be treated\r\nfrom its very beginning, without a presupposition of some knowledge and\r\ncomprehension on the part of the reader. There only remains then, as it\r\nseems to me, such a consideration of musical form from varied points of\r\nview, and proceeding in varied directions, yet always with reference\r\nto some particular case, as shall bring into play the reader's special\r\nmusical experiences and assist him to a true understanding of the\r\nsubject. If he should be struck with only one particular point and\r\nshould feel it become a reality for\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(xxiv)\r\n\r\nhim, he will henceforward have a clue to the mastery of the rest. To\r\nthis end I hope that my historical survey of the development of musical\r\nforms, and my general observations concerning the laws of the art, may\r\ntend. And here I must remark that I have had no intention of providing\r\nthe technical musician with a theoretical analysis of separate works,\r\nbut that my characterisation has been limited by the position of its\r\nobject in the whole representation. I leave you to judge, my dear\r\nfriend, how far, under these difficult circumstances, I have succeeded\r\nin expressing myself clearly and forcibly; I can only affirm with\r\nconfidence that all that I have said has been realised and experienced\r\nby myself.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy and assistance of my honoured friend Hauptmann has been a\r\nsource of great gratification to me during the publication of my book.\r\nI do not desire to impose upon him any share of responsibility in it,\r\nby thanking him for the care with which he has overlooked the author\r\nas well as the compositor; but you will understand how I have been\r\nencouraged and refreshed during my labours by continual proofs of\r\nhis friendly sympathy, and how sorely I miss my pleasant personal\r\nintercourse with him.\r\n\r\nThe hour is late, my dear friend, later than it was our wont to separate\r\nafter our musical revels, which, in the opinion of your amiable wife,\r\noften lasted far too long.\r\n\r\nFarewell, and accept my book with the same cordial sympathy and\r\nindulgence which I have hitherto found so invaluable.\r\n\r\nOTTO JAHN.\r\n\r\nBonn, November 30, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--I can scarcely describe to you the depression of\r\nspirits with which I laid aside my pen at the close of my foregoing\r\nletter to you. When I looked at the thick volume before me, which had\r\ngrown so wonderfully under my hands, and reflected that several others\r\nwere to follow, I felt a misgiving amounting to certainty that my work\r\nwas ill-planned, badly executed, or altogether out of place. I should\r\nnot have believed any one who had prophesied the result that was\r\nactually to follow. The gradual conviction that I had been mistaken,\r\nthat the book was a success beyond anything I had dared to expect, the\r\nmany proofs I received of acknowledgment and sympathy, were my best\r\nencouragement to apply my whole energies to the completion of my arduous\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nWhen it became necessary to prepare a second edition, I rejoiced at\r\nthe prospect of revising the whole work in the light of my acquired\r\nexperience, and hoped that this labour of love would recompense me\r\nfor all my pains. In this expectation I was, however, deceived; the\r\nrevision, which I now lay before you, assumed the proportions of a heavy\r\ntask, requiring the exertions of all my powers for its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe gloom of the last few years cast its shadows even over my work, as\r\nyou, who seek and recognise the living author behind his words, will\r\nnot fail to discover; I trust that you will also find traces of the\r\nconscientiousness with which I have striven to perform my appointed\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nYou will agree with me in thinking that it would have been unadvisable\r\nto subvert the whole design of the book in substance and form, and that\r\nI must content myself with such improvements in matters of detail as\r\nwould bring me\r\n\r\n{LIFE OF MOZART,}\r\n\r\n(xxvi)\r\n\r\nsomewhat nearer to the end I had in view. It was, of course, my first\r\nendeavour to rectify such errors and remove such blemishes as had been\r\nobserved either by myself or others, and I then proceeded to turn to\r\naccount all the materials that had come to hand for the completion or\r\nenrichment of my narrative. I had become the fortunate possessor of\r\ncopies of Mozart's complete correspondence, so far as I know it to\r\nexist. If, as I trust was the case, the extracts already before the\r\npublic had been found useful and trustworthy, there could be no doubt\r\nthat the completed version would render my narrative more accurate and\r\nlifelike. In addition, I had now Mozart's entire compositions, either\r\nautograph or copied, so that I could confirm my account and my criticism\r\nof each work by direct reference.\r\n\r\nBesides these efficient materials for the confirmation of my main\r\nauthorities, I had received numerous separate communications, partly\r\nfrom friends to whom I owe much gratitude, partly from publications of\r\nthe last ten years bearing upon my subject, some of which have been of\r\ngreat service to me.\r\n\r\nThe most important aid, both to myself and to the readers of this\r\nedition, has been afforded by Ludwig v. Köchel's \"Chronologischthematisches\r\nVerzeichniss sammtlicher Tonwerke W. A. Mozarts\" (Leipzig,\r\n1862). The necessity for such a catalogue had so strongly impressed me\r\nthat I had resolved on compiling it myself, when I fortunately learned\r\nthat Köchel was at work upon it. I was speedily convinced that it was in\r\nfar better hands than mine, and it gave me genuine pleasure to afford\r\nit such assistance as was in my power. Unexampled assiduity, sparing\r\nneither sacrifice nor exertion, has produced a work which, from the\r\ncompleteness of its research and the accuracy of its execution, may\r\nserve as a model. A few addenda and corrections were indeed unavoidable:\r\nKochel has himself indicated some (Allg. Mus. Ztg., 1864, p. 493),\r\nand you will find two or three trifling ones in my book. The fact that\r\nKöchel's catalogue contains a complete chronological and biographical\r\naccount of all Mozart's compositions freed my book from all the notices\r\nand references found necessary\r\n\r\n{INTRODUCTION.}\r\n\r\n(xxvii)\r\n\r\nin corroboration of my statements. A reference to the number in Köchel's\r\ncatalogue became, in most cases, sufficient; and I was able also to omit\r\nnotices of errors in the published works which Köchel had remarked upon.\r\nThese, as far as the great operas are concerned, will soon be rendered\r\nstill more superfluous by the projected new edition of the scores from\r\nthe autograph originals. Köche's friendship, which I regard as the\r\ngreatest gain of our common labours, has aided and supported me\r\nthroughout the preparation of this edition. I will not attempt to\r\nenumerate all that he has communicated, verified, and brought into\r\nagreement for me: he knows the amount of his aid and of my gratitude.\r\nSonnleithner, Karajan, Pohl, Jul. André, have been equally obliging in\r\nsatisfying my demands and inquiries. Special thanks are due to them\r\nif my book attains that accuracy of detail, wherein I place its chief\r\nvalue. I may claim to have made tolerably exhaustive use of all that has\r\nbeen published concerning Mozart during the last ten years, but you will\r\nscarcely expect me to enumerate all my corrections and improvements.\r\nIt has been my aim to retain all that had been proved good in my work,\r\nwhile making such additions as served to place my subject more clearly\r\nand fully before my readers.\r\n\r\nIf a perusal of my second edition should leave you with the impression\r\nthat the task of revision and correction has been an easy one, I shall,\r\nwhatever my convictions to the contrary, congratulate myself on having\r\napproached the object which I have kept steadily in view.\r\n\r\nAccept my book, then, in its new dress, with the old spirit of\r\nfriendship, and gladden the heart of its author once more by the\r\nsympathy he has never yet found wanting.\r\n\r\nOTTO JAHN.\r\n\r\nBonn, March 6, 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S NOTE.\r\n\r\nCONSIDERABLE doubt has existed in the mind of the translator as to the\r\nproper English equivalent for the word \"clavier\" throughout this work.\r\nClavier is a generic term in German, and is used to denote any keyed\r\ninstrument, whether harpsichord, clavichord, or pianoforte. Mozart's\r\ncompositions for the clavier are equally available for all these\r\ninstruments, and in his early years he performed indifferently on the\r\nharpsichord or clavichord. His first introduction to the pianoforte was\r\nat Augsburg, in 1777, and he did not become familiar with the instrument\r\nuntil after his settlement in Vienna in 1781. It has been thought best,\r\ntherefore, to leave the word _clavier_ untranslated up to this date,\r\nafter which it is translated _pianoforte_, whether it is applied to\r\nMozart's performances or to his compositions.\r\n\r\nIt has not been thought advisable to give in the English edition of the\r\nwork all the Appendixes which appear in the German. Many of them are of\r\ninterest only in the original, others have already been translated\r\namong Mozart's correspondence. Those which seemed likely to interest\r\nthe English reader have been translated. The musical Appendixes have all\r\nbeen omitted as bulky and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe only part of Herr Jahn's work against which the charge of\r\nincompleteness can fairly be brought is the Index; an entirely new one\r\nhas therefore been made for the English edition, and will, it is hoped,\r\nbe found minute and accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF MOZART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. -- CHILDHOOD\r\n\r\nWOLFGANG AMADE MOZART came of a family belonging originally to the\r\nartisan class. We find his ancestors settled in Augsburg early in the\r\nseventeenth century, and following their calling there without any great\r\nsuccess.[1001] His grandfather, Johann Georg Mozart, a bookbinder, married,\r\nOctober 7, 1708, Anna Maria Peterin, the widow of another bookbinder,\r\nAugustin Banneger.2 From this union sprang two daughters and three sons,\r\nviz.: Fr. Joseph Ignaz, Franz Alois (who carried on his father's trade\r\nin his native town), and Johann Georg Leopold Mozart, born on November\r\n14, 1719, the father of the Mozart of our biography.8 Gifted with a\r\nkeen intellect and firm will he early formed the resolution of raising\r\nhimself to a higher position in the world than that hitherto occupied by\r\nhis family; and in his later years he could point with just elation to\r\nhis own arduous efforts, and the success which had crowned them, when he\r\nwas urging his son to the same steady perseverance.\r\n\r\nWhen Wolfgang visited Augsburg in 1777, he gathered many particulars of\r\nhis father's youth which refreshed the recollections of Leopold himself.\r\nWe find him writing to his son (October 10, 1777) how, as a boy, he had\r\nsung a cantata at the monastery of St. Ulrich, for the wedding of the\r\nHofrath Oefele, and how he had often climbed the broken steps to the\r\norgan loft, to sing treble at the Feast\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(4)\r\n\r\nof the Holy Cross (November 29, 1777). He afterwards became an excellent\r\norganist: a certain Herr von Freisinger, of Munich, told Wolfgang\r\n(October 10, 1777) that he knew his father well, he had studied with\r\nhim, and \"had the liveliest recollections of Wessobrunn where my father\r\n(this was news to me) played the organ remarkably well. He said: 'It\r\nwas wonderful, to see his hands and feet going together, but exceedingly\r\nfine--yes, he was an extraordinary man. My father thought very highly\r\nof him. And how he used to jeer at the priests, when they wanted him to\r\nturn monk.'\" This last must have been of peculiar interest to Wolfgang,\r\nwho knew his father only as a devout and strict observer of the Catholic\r\nreligion. But Leopold remembered the days of his youth, and wrote to\r\nhis wife (December 15, 1777): \"Let me ask, if Wolfgang has not of late\r\nneglected to go to confession? God should ever be first in our thoughts!\r\nto Him alone must we look for earthly happiness, and we should ever keep\r\neternity in view; young people, I know, are averse to hearing of these\r\nthings; I was young myself once; but God be thanked, I always came to\r\nmyself after my youthful follies, fled from all dangers to my soul, and\r\nkept steadily in view God, and my honour, and the dangerous consequences\r\nof indulgence in sin.\"\r\n\r\nLong-continued exertions and self-denial laid the foundation of Leopold\r\nMozart's character in a conscientious earnestness and devotion to duty\r\nin great things as in small; they had the effect also of rendering his\r\njudgment of others somewhat hard and uncompromising. This is observable\r\nin his relations as an official, and as a teacher, and in his dealings\r\non matters of religion. He was a strict Catholic, and feared nothing\r\nso much for his children as the influence which a prolonged stay in\r\nProtestant countries might exert on their faith; he remarked with\r\nsurprise that his travelling companions, Baron Hopfgarten and Baron\r\nBose, had often edified him with their discourse, although they were\r\nLutherans (Paris, April 1, 1764).\r\n\r\nWhen in London, he became acquainted with the excellent violoncellist\r\nSiprutini, son of a Dutch Jew, who had broken loose from Judaism and\r\n\"was content to believe in\r\n\r\n{L. MOZART'S CHARACTER.}\r\n\r\n(5)\r\n\r\none God, to love Him first, and his neighbour as himself, and to live\r\nan honest life\"; L. Mozart gained an acknowledgment from him that of all\r\nthe Christian creeds the Catholic was the best, and was not without hope\r\nof converting him altogether (September 13, 1764).\r\n\r\nHe fulfilled all the duties which the Church requires of her children\r\nwith conscientiousness and zeal; we find him ordering masses to be said,\r\nbuying relics, &c., whenever occasion offers.\r\n\r\nThe strictly orthodox, almost ascetic, rules of life which the reigning\r\narchbishop, Sigismund, followed and enforced in his court and in all\r\nSalzburg must have had the effect of deepening this side of L. Mozart's\r\ncharacter; while the greater freedom in church matters enjoyed under\r\nSigis-mund's successor, Hieronymus, was not without its influence,\r\nevinced by his becoming late in life a freemason. There can be no doubt\r\nthat L. Mozart was a man of genuine piety, which stood firm amid strong\r\ntemptations and the most trying circumstances. It was in accordance\r\nwith his education and position in life that this piety found no better\r\njustification and expression than those provided by his Church. His\r\nperformance of his duties to God and the Church was undertaken in the\r\nsame rigorous spirit which characterised him in all the relations of\r\nlife. But he was too sensible not to remonstrate with his daughter when\r\nshe chose rather to endanger her health than to be absent from mass\r\n(July 28, 1786). He was entirely free from superstition, and when some\r\none wrote to him of a ghost-story he declared that \"it must be only\r\nan hysterical illusion of the maid-servant.\" Again, he had \"invariably\r\nfound that begging sisterhoods were the signs of much moral degradation\r\nconcealed under the cloak of hypocrisy\" (December 16, 1785). It would be\r\na great mistake to consider the elder Mozart as a narrow-minded bigot.\r\nUnited to a shrewd, clear intellect, for the cultivation of which he\r\nmade extraordinary efforts, he possessed a decided turn for raillery\r\nand sarcasm. His painful endeavours to work himself free of his petty\r\nsurroundings, his habit of looking beyond the narrow horizon which\r\nencircled him, encouraged in him a cynical\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(6)\r\n\r\nturn of mind. It grew to be a settled conviction with him that\r\nselfishness is the only motive of human action on which we can safely\r\nreckon, and which, therefore, we must strive to turn to account: a\r\nbelief in disinterested philanthropy or friendship is a folly which\r\nseldom goes unpunished. Nor should we have any faith in an innate love\r\nof truth. \"Take it as an universal truth,\" he writes (October 6, 1785),\r\n\"all men tell lies, and add to the truth, or take away from it, just\r\nas it suits their purpose. Especially must we believe nothing which,\r\nif known, would add to the reputation of the speaker or flatter his\r\ninterlocutor, for that is sure to be false.\" This distrust of mankind he\r\nsought to implant in his son, but with very little success. Nor did his\r\ngloomy views of life stifle, even in himself, all emotion and sentiment.\r\nHis theory, as so often happens, went farther than his practice. When\r\nLeopold Mozart analysed the conduct of men, his criticism was sharp and\r\ncutting, but he was always ready with counsel and assistance when they\r\nwere needed. Notwithstanding his piety he expressed bitter contempt for\r\nthe priesthood and priestcraft: he had occasion to know both intimately.\r\nHe was never dazzled by the distinctions of birth and position. He\r\njudged those nearest and dearest to him, not excepting his beloved son,\r\nas severely as the rest of the world. It had the most wholesome effect\r\non the development of Mozart's character and genius that his father, who\r\nloved him as only a father can love, who justly estimated and admired\r\nhis artistic genius, was never dazzled by it, never ignored nor\r\nconcealed his weaknesses, but warned and blamed him, and strove to bring\r\nhim up with a conscientious fidelity to duty.\r\n\r\nLeopold Mozart was aware that the education of his son was the highest\r\nand greatest task of his life; but this absorbing care did not narrow\r\nhis breadth of sympathy, nor lessen his consideration for others bound\r\nto him by natural ties; he proved himself always a devoted friend as\r\nwell as, for one of his means, a liberal benefactor.\r\n\r\nThe exertions which it had cost him to attain to even a moderate\r\nposition, the unceasing thought which he was obliged to take for the\r\nsupply of his daily needs gave him\r\n\r\n{L. MOZART'S EARLY LIFE.}\r\n\r\n(7)\r\n\r\na high appreciation of the value of a secured worldly position, and as\r\nhe became gradually convinced that his son was not likely to attach the\r\nsame importance to this, he strove the more by his wisdom and experience\r\nto help to secure it for him. This care for economical details has been\r\nunjustly condemned. We may grant that a somewhat exaggerated anxiety\r\nincreased by the hypochondria of old age was the natural result of the\r\nstruggle with narrow circumstances which he had carried on all his\r\nlife; but this is far more than counterbalanced by the singular union of\r\ngeneral and of musical culture, of love and severity, of just judgment\r\nand earnest devotion to duty, which Leopold Mozart developed in the\r\neducation of his son. Without them, Wolfgang would certainly not have\r\nbeen the man he became by their help.\r\n\r\nWe have no detailed information of L. Mozart's youthful life. His\r\nrecollections of his position at Augsburg are bitter and sarcastic.\r\nEven with his brothers and sisters, whom he accused of having turned\r\nthe weakness of their mother to his disadvantage, he had no close or\r\nintimate connection, although they had never any scruples in applying\r\nfor his support.\r\n\r\n\"When I thought of your journey to Augsburg,\" he writes to Wolfgang\r\n(October 18, 1777), \"Wieland's 'Abderiten' always occurred to me. One\r\nought to have the opportunity of seeing in its naked reality that of\r\nwhich one has formed an ideal conception.\"\r\n\r\nAfter passing through school life in his native town, he went to\r\nSalzburg to study jurisprudence. The monastery of St. Ulrich belonged\r\nto the community of the Benedictines, which had founded and still partly\r\nmaintained the university of Salzburg;[1004] this connection may have\r\ngiven Leopold a reason for going thither. But as he did not obtain\r\nemployment, he was constrained to enter the service of Count Thurn,\r\nCanon of Salzburg. From his youth up, he had cultivated his musical\r\ntalent with assiduity, and was a\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(8)\r\n\r\nthoroughly practical and well-informed musician. He had chiefly\r\nmaintained himself in early youth by his singing, and afterwards by\r\ngiving lessons, and had gained considerable reputation as a violinist,\r\nso much so that Archbishop Leopold took him into his service in the year\r\n1743. He afterwards became court composer and leader of the orchestra,\r\nand in 1762 was appointed Vice-Kapellmeister by Archbishop Sigismund.\r\n\r\nThe pay of the choir was scanty, though their duties were heavy. Leopold\r\nMozart submitted to these demands with his accustomed conscientiousness,\r\nand Schubart points him out as the man whose exertions had placed music\r\nin Salzburg on its then excellent footing.[1005] His official position\r\nnecessitated his appearing as a composer; in this respect, too, he was\r\nindefatigable, and won for himself an honourable reputation.\r\n\r\nA list of his compositions compiled in 1757, no doubt by himself, gives\r\nan idea of his industry as a composer.[1006] We find a large proportion\r\nof church music. A Mass in C major is in the library at Munich, Julius\r\nAndré possesses a Mass in F major, the Credo of a \"Missa brevis\" in F\r\nmajor lies before me; a \"Missa brevis\" in A major is preserved in\r\nthe cathedral of Salzburg, together with the Offertory, \"Parasti in\r\nconspectu meo,\" three Loretto Litanies (in G, F, and E flat major),\r\nand a Litany \"De venerabili\" in D major, composed in 1762. This last,\r\na carefully finished work, was sent by L. Mozart in December, 1774,\r\nto Munich, together with a grand Litany by his son. It is written for\r\nsolos, chorus, and the usual small church orchestra of the day, and\r\nshows throughout the learning of a musician skilled in the use of\r\ntraditional forms. The harmony is correct, the disposition of the parts\r\nskilful, and the contrapuntal forms are handled boldly; nor does the\r\ncomposer fail to introduce regular, well-worked-out fugues in the proper\r\nplaces; \"Cum Sancto Spiritu,\" and \"Et\r\n\r\n{L. MOZART'S COMPOSITIONS.}\r\n\r\n(9)\r\n\r\nvitam venturi sæculi\" in the Mass, \"Pignus futuræ gloriæ\" in the Litany.\r\n\r\nBut there is no originality or inventive power either in the\r\ncompositions as a whole, or in isolated passages. Leopold Mozart's\r\nsacred music gives him a right to an honourable place among contemporary\r\ncomposers, but to no higher rank. Schubart, who prefers his church music\r\nto his chamber music, says justly, that his style was thorough, and\r\nshowed great knowledge of counterpoint, but that he was somewhat\r\nold-fashioned.[1007] When Wolfgang was busy composing church music with\r\nVan Swieten at Vienna, he wrote to his father (March 29, 1783): \"Some of\r\nyour best church music would be very useful to us; we like to study\r\nall masters, ancient and modern, so please send us some as soon as\r\npossible.\" But to Wolfgang's regret this request was refused, for his\r\nfather was quite aware of the change of taste in such music that had\r\ntaken place since his day.\r\n\r\nNothing certain is known of twelve oratorios composed according to\r\ncustom for Lent,[1008] nor of \"a host of theatrical pieces, as well as\r\npantomimes.\"[1009]\r\n\r\nL. Mozart was an industrious instrumental composer. He enumerates\r\nupwards of thirty serenades, \"containing instrumental solos,\" and a\r\nlong list of symphonies, \"some only quartets, others for all the usual\r\ninstruments\"; of\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(10)\r\n\r\nthese, eighteen are thematically catalogued,[10010] and one in G major\r\nis by mistake attributed to Wolfgang, and printed in score. Very curious\r\nare the \"Occasional Pieces\" which are characteristic of the times, in\r\ntheir odd instrumental effects, and somewhat heavy touches of fun. Among\r\nthese are a pastoral symphony with shepherds' horns and two obbligato\r\nflutes; a military piece with trumpets, drums, kettle-drums, and fifes;\r\na Turkish and a Chinese piece; a pastoral, representing a rural wedding,\r\nand introducing lyres, bagpipes, and dulcimers; during the march, after\r\neach huzza, there was a pistol-shot, after the custom of rural weddings,\r\nand L. Mozart directed that whoever could whistle well on his fingers,\r\nwas to whistle during the huzzas.\r\n\r\nBut the musical \"Sledge Drive\" seems to have gained most applause;\r\na pianoforte arrangement was afterwards printed, the effect being\r\nheightened by the accompaniment of five differently toned harness-bells.\r\nThe following programme was printed by L. Mozart, for a performance of\r\nthe Collegium Musicum in Augsburg, December 29, 1755:--\r\n\r\nMUSICAL SLEDGE DRIVE.\r\n\r\nIntroduced by a prelude, consisting of a pleasing andante and a splendid\r\nallegro.\r\n\r\nThen follows:\r\n\r\nA prelude, with trumpets and drums.\r\n\r\nAfter this:\r\n\r\nThe Sledge Drive, with the sledge-bells and all the other instruments.\r\n\r\nAfter the Sledge Drive:\r\n\r\nThe horses are heard rattling their harness.\r\n\r\nAnd then:\r\n\r\nThe trumpets and drums alternate agreeably with the oboes, French horns,\r\nand bassoons, the first representing the cavalcade, the second the\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nAfter this:\r\n\r\nThe trumpets and drums have another prelude, and\r\n\r\nThe Sledge Drive begins again, but stops suddenly, for all the party\r\ndismount, and enter the ball-room.\r\n\r\nThen comes an adagio, representing the ladies trembling with cold.\r\n\r\n{L. MOZART'S COMPOSITIONS.}\r\n\r\n(11)\r\n\r\nThe ball is opened with a minuet and trio.\r\n\r\nThe company endeavour to warm themselves by country-dances.\r\n\r\nThen follows the departure, and, finally:\r\n\r\nDuring a flourish of trumpets and drums, the whole party mount their\r\nsledges and drive homewards.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the performance of these occasional pieces in\r\nAugsburg, L. Mozart received the following anonymous letter:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur et très cher ami!\r\n\r\n\"May it please you to compose no more absurdities, such as Chinese and\r\nTurkish music, sledge drives, and peasant weddings, for they reflect\r\nmore shame and contempt on you than honour, which is regretted by the\r\nindividual who herewith warns you and remains,\r\n\r\n\"Your sincere Friend.\r\n\r\n\"Datum in domo verae amicitice.\"\r\n\r\nLeopold Mozart was not a little annoyed by this act of friendship,\r\nwhich he was inclined to ascribe to the Kapellmeister Schmidt or to the\r\norganist Seyffert. It need scarcely be said that this \"programme-music\"\r\nis innocent either of originality or of instrumental colouring. Short\r\ncharacteristic pieces, such as Couperin and Rameau wrote, were composed\r\nby L. Mozart, in common with Eberlin, for a kind of organ with a\r\nhorn stop, which had been erected by Joh. Roch. Egedacher on the\r\nfortifications above the town. Once a month, morning and evening, a\r\npiece was played on this instrument; in February it was the Carnival, in\r\nSeptember a hunting song, in December a cradle song.[10011]\r\n\r\nBesides all this, L. Mozart wrote many concertos, particularly for\r\nthe flute, oboe, bassoon, French horn, or trumpet (one of these is in\r\nMunich), innumerable trios (he offered a flautist, named Zinner, in\r\nAugsburg, fourteen trios for flute, violin, and violoncello), and\r\ndivertimenti for various instruments,[10012] marches, minuets,\r\nopera-dances, &c. Three clavier\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(12)\r\n\r\nsonatas are printed,[10013] of which Faiszt remarks that they might well\r\nbe the work of Leopold's great son, so strong is their similarity in\r\nform and spirit.[10014] is compositions were for the most part only in\r\nmanuscript, as was almost all the music of that day.[10015] By way of\r\npractice in engraving, he engraved three trio sonatas himself in 1740,\r\nand revived the old accomplishment in 1778, when he engraved some\r\nvariations for his son.\r\n\r\nIn later years he composed little or nothing; his position in Salzburg\r\nwas so little to his mind that he did not feel himself called on to\r\ndo more than his duty required; besides, the education of his children\r\nengrossed his whole time, and when his son had come forward as a\r\ncomposer, he would on no account have entered into competition with\r\nhim.[10016] L. Mozart was proud of the estimation in which his works\r\nwere held abroad, as the following extract from a letter to his friend\r\nLotter shows:\r\n\r\nNovember 24, 1755.\r\n\r\nI may tell you in strict confidence that I have received a letter from\r\na distant place inviting me to become a member ------ don't be\r\nalarmed--or--don't laugh ---- a member of the Corresponding Society of\r\nMusical Science.[10017] Potz Plunder! say I. But do not tell tales out\r\nof school, for it may be only talk. I never dreamt of such a thing in my\r\nlife; that I can honestly say.\r\n\r\nBut the elder Mozart acquired his chief reputation as a musician by the\r\npublication in 1756 of his \"Attempt towards a Fundamental Method for the\r\nViolin.\"[10018] This work was\r\n\r\n{L. MOZART'S VIOLIN METHOD.}\r\n\r\n(13)\r\n\r\nspread abroad in numerous editions and translations, and was for many\r\nyears the only published instruction on the art of violin-playing;\r\nproof enough that it rendered important service in its day, as far as\r\ntechnical knowledge was concerned. What makes the book still interesting\r\nto us is the earnest, intelligent spirit which speaks from it, and\r\nshows us the man as he was. He sought to impart to his pupils a sound,\r\npractical musical education; they were not only to practise their\r\nfingers, but were always clearly to, understand _what_ they had to\r\nexecute and _why_: \"It is dispiriting to go on playing at random,\r\nwithout knowing what you are about\" (p. 245); a good violinist should\r\neven be practised in rhetoric and poetry to be able to execute with\r\nintelligence (p. 107). He insists strongly that the pupil should not\r\nadvance until he is quite able for what he has to learn: \"In this\r\nconsists the gravest error that either master or pupil can fall into.\r\nThe former often lack patience to wait for the right time; or they let\r\nthemselves be carried away by the pupil, who thinks he has done wonders\r\nwhen he can scrape out a minuet or two. Often, too, the parents or\r\nguardians of the beginner are anxious to hear him play some of these\r\nimperfect tunes, and think, with satisfaction how well their money has\r\nbeen spent on the lessons. How greatly they are mistaken!\" (p.57,\r\ncf. 121.)\r\n\r\nThe study is not to be made too easy or simple; the learner must exert\r\nhimself and work hard. Thus he writes at the beginning of the exercises\r\n(p. 90): \"These are the passages for practice. The more distasteful they\r\nare, the better I shall be pleased; I have striven to make them so\";\r\nthat is, to guard against their being played from memory.\r\n\r\nThe same ability is displayed in his principles of taste.\r\n\r\nHe exacts above all a \"straightforward, manly tone\"; \"nothing can be\r\nmore absurd than to seem afraid even to grasp the violin firmly; or just\r\nto touch the strings with the bow (held perhaps with two fingers), and\r\nto attempt such an artistic up-bow to the very nut of the violin that\r\nonly a note here and there is heard in a whisper, without any idea what\r\nit means, it is all so like a dream\" (p. 101).\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(14)\r\n\r\nSimple, natural expression is the highest aim of the violinist, so that\r\nthe instrument may imitate as far as possible the art of song (p. 50);\r\n\"who does not grant that to _sing_ their music has been the aim of all\r\ninstrumentalists, because they have ever striven after nature?\" (p.\r\n107.)[10019] He is severe on performers who \"tremble upon every long\r\nnote, or cannot play a couple of bars simply without introducing their\r\nsenseless and ridiculous tricks and fancies\" (p. 50). They are blamed\r\nthe more as they are for the most part wanting in the necessary\r\nknowledge where to bring in their ornamentation without involving errors\r\nin the composition (pp. 209, 195). Other faults of the virtuoso are\r\nequally severely dealt with, such as the _tremolo_ of the player \"who\r\nshakes away on every note as if he had the ague\" (p. 238), or the\r\nconstant introduction of the so-called \"flageolet tones\" (p. 107), or\r\nthe alternate hurrying and dragging of the \"virtuoso of imagination.\"\r\n\"Many,\" says he (p. 262), \"who have no conception of taste, disdain to\r\nkeep uniform time in the accompaniment of a concerted part, and strive\r\nto follow the principal part. That is accompanying like a bungler, not\r\nlike an artist. It is true that in accompanying some Italian singers,\r\nwho learn everything by heart and never adhere to time or measure, one\r\nhas often to pass over whole bars to save them from open shame. But\r\nin accompanying a true artist, worthy of the name, not a note must be\r\ndelayed or anticipated, there must be neither hurry nor dragging, so\r\nthat every note may have proper expression, otherwise the accompaniment\r\nwould destroy the effect of the composition. A clever accompanist should\r\nalso be able to judge of the performer. He must not spoil the _tempo\r\nrubato_ of an experienced artist by waiting to follow him. It is not\r\neasy to describe this 'stolen time.' A 'virtuoso of imagination' often\r\ngives to a semiquaver in an adagio cantabile the time of half a bar,\r\nbefore recovering\r\n\r\n{L. MOZART'S VIOLIN METHOD.}\r\n\r\n(15)\r\n\r\nfrom his paroxysm of feeling; and he cares nothing at all for the time:\r\nhe plays in recitative.\"\r\n\r\nTechnical instruction and skill are to him only the means to a higher\r\nend. The performer must be capable of expressing all the pathos of the\r\npiece before him, so as to penetrate to the souls and stir the passions\r\nof the audience (pp. 52, 253).[10020] As the most important requisite to\r\nthe violinist for attaining this, he indicates the stroke of the bow\r\n(p. 122) as \"the medium by the judicious use of which we are able to\r\ncommunicate the pathos of the music to the audience.\" \"I consider,\" he\r\nadds \"that a composer attains his highest aim when he finds a suitable\r\nmelody for every sentiment, and knows how to give it its right\r\nexpression.\" \"Many a second-rate composer,\" he says (p. 252), \"is full\r\nof delight, and thinks more than ever of himself when he hears his\r\nnonsensical music executed by good artists, by whose artistic expression\r\neven such miserable trash is made intelligible to the audience.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain that he was a sworn enemy to smatterers and pretenders.\r\nThorough technical study and an intellect trained to clear and rational\r\nthought he considered absolutely indispensable to a true artist. He\r\ngrants, indeed, that genius may atone for the want of learning, and that\r\na man highly gifted by nature may lack the opportunity of studying his\r\nart scientifically. But this does not detract from the main proposition\r\nnor make his demands less just.\r\n\r\nThe extracts given above illustrate the principles and the views with\r\nwhich L. Mozart undertook the musical education of his son, and these\r\nbeing united to a correct appreciation of the freedom and indulgence\r\ndue to great natural powers, it must be acknowledged that no genius\r\ncould have been trained under happier auspices!\r\n\r\nThis work, so remarkable for the age, met with suitable recognition.\r\nMarpurg, to whose judgment L. Mozart had\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(16)\r\n\r\nsubmitted it in his preface, speaks of it as follows: [10021] \"The\r\nwant of a work of this kind has been long felt, but hitherto in vain.\r\nA thorough and skilled performer, a sensible and methodical teacher,\r\na learned musician, a man possessing all those qualities which singly\r\ncommand our respect, are here to be found united in one individual--the\r\nauthor. What Geminiani did for the English nation, Mozart has\r\naccomplished for the German, and their works are worthy to live side by\r\nside in universal approbation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this it is not surprising that the first of the critical letters\r\non music which were published under Marpurg's direction at Berlin in\r\n1759 and 1760 should be addressed to L. Mozart, with the declaration\r\nthat the society which proposed to address each letter to some person\r\nof distinction, could not make a fitter commencement than with him.\r\nSchubart says,[10022] \"He gained great reputation through his 'Method,'\r\nwhich is written in good German, and with admirable judgment. The\r\nexamples are well chosen, and the system of fingering not in the least\r\npedantic; the author doubtless inclines to the school of Tartini, but he\r\npermits greater freedom in the management of the bow.\" Zelter expresses\r\nhimself in the same spirit:[10023] \"His 'Violin Method' is a work\r\nwhich will be of use as long as the violin is an instrument. It is well\r\nwritten, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe praise of the author's style of writing is characteristic and well\r\ndeserved; it was then a far rarer distinction among artists than at\r\npresent. L. Mozart's style is sharp and clear; his sarcastic turn of\r\nmind is so prominent that he apologises for it in the preface, although\r\nit is not unusual in the musical literature of the time. Both in\r\nthis book and in his letters he proves himself a man who has not only\r\nacquired cultivation by intercourse with the world and by travel,\r\nbut who is well acquainted with literature, has read with taste and\r\ndiscernment, and has well-defined and judicious opinions\r\n\r\n{L. MOZART'S POSITION IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(17)\r\n\r\nboth on aesthetic and moral subjects. He addressed to the poet Gellert a\r\nletter so full of veneration that Gellert replied in the warmest terms,\r\nas the following extract will show:--\r\n\r\nI should be insensible, indeed, if the extraordinary kindness with which\r\nyou honoured me had left me unmoved, and I should be the most ungrateful\r\nof men if I could have received your letter without acknowledgment. I\r\naccept your love and friendship, my dear sir, with the same frankness\r\nwith which they are offered. Do you, indeed, read my works and encourage\r\nyour friends to do the same? Such approbation, I can truly say, was more\r\nthan I could have dared to hope from such a quarter. Does my last poem,\r\n\"Der Christ,\" meet with your approval? I venture to answer myself in the\r\naffirmative. To this I am encouraged by the subject of the poem, your\r\nown noble spirit, as unwittingly you display it in your letters, and by\r\nmy consciousness of honest endeavour.\r\n\r\nBaron von Bose presented \"the little Orpheus of seven years old,\"\r\nwhen in Paris, with Gellert's songs, recommending him to borrow their\r\nirresistible harmonies, \"so that the hardened atheist may read and mark\r\nthem, may hear them and fall down and worship God.\" Perhaps this gift\r\ngave occasion to the letter. Wolfgang informs his sister at a later\r\ndate, from Milan, of the death of Gellert, which took place there.\r\n\r\nWith this amount of cultivation, and the pretensions consequent on\r\nit, it is not surprising that Leopold Mozart felt himself isolated\r\nat Salzburg. He had his duties to perform at court, and the more\r\ncontemptible their remuneration was, the more he and the other officials\r\nwere made to feel their dependent position. He was employed as a teacher\r\nin most of the families of rank at Salzburg, for his instruction was\r\njustly considered as the best that could be had; but this did not imply\r\nany degree of friendly intimacy. He was too proud to ingratiate himself\r\nwith them by flattery or obsequiousness, although, as a man of the\r\nworld, he knew how to moderate his satirical humour, and was always\r\naffable and well-bred. He seems to have had little intercourse with his\r\ncolleagues. This was partly owing to circumstances, but partly also to\r\ntheir want of musical proficiency or mental cultivation, joined to their\r\nlooser, less earnest mode of life.\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(18)\r\n\r\nThe social relations of the Mozart family were, however, cheerful and\r\nunconstrained; their intercourse with their friends had more of innocent\r\nmerriment than of intellectual enjoyment. \"The Salzburg mind,\" says\r\nSchubart,[10024] \"is tuned to low comedy. Their popular songs are\r\nso drolly burlesque that one cannot listen to them without dying of\r\nlaughter. The clownish spirit[10025] shines through them all, though\r\nthe melodies are often fine and beautiful.\" This tendency would scarcely\r\nplease so serious and critical a man as L. Mozart, whose humour was\r\ncaustic, but not broad, and who appears to have entered with constraint\r\ninto the ordinary tone of conversation.\r\n\r\nOn November 21, 1747, Leopold Mozart married Anna Maria Pertlin (or\r\nBertlin), daughter of the steward of the Convent of St. Gilgen. \"To-day\r\nis the anniversary of our wedding,\" wrote L. Mozart (November 21, 1772);\r\n\"it is, I believe, exactly twenty-five years since we were struck with\r\nthe good idea of getting married, or rather it had occurred to us many\r\nyears before. But good things take time.\"\r\n\r\nThey were reputed the handsomest pair of their time in Salzburg, and\r\ntheir existing portraits do not contradict this. Frau Mozart was, as\r\nfar as she can be represented by letters and descriptions, a very\r\ngood-tempered woman, full of love for her family, but in no way\r\ndistinguished; and the often verified experience that great men owe\r\ntheir gifts and their culture principally to their mothers was not\r\nproved to be true in the case of Mozart. She submitted willingly to the\r\nsuperiority of her husband, and left to his care and management with\r\nabsolute confidence all that lay outside the sphere of the actual\r\nhousekeeping. The possession by\r\n\r\n{WOLFGANG'S MOTHER AND SISTER--HIS BIRTH.}\r\n\r\n(19)\r\n\r\neach of those qualities necessary for the happiness of the other lay at\r\nthe root of the heartfelt love and affection which bound them to each\r\nother and to their children, and the latter were provided with the\r\nsurest foundation for their moral culture in the influence of a pure\r\nand harmonious family life. They were deeply attached to their cheerful,\r\nhappy-tempered mother; but that she failed in authority was clear when\r\nshe accompanied her son in his ill-considered visit to Paris. In spite\r\nof her better judgment she was unable either to control his impetuosity\r\nor to withstand his endearments.\r\n\r\nThough far inferior to her husband in cultivation, she was not without\r\nunderstanding, and had a turn for the humorous, which characterised her\r\nas a native of Salzburg. In this respect Wolfgang was her true son.\r\n\r\nOf seven children resulting from this union, only two survived: a\r\ndaughter, Maria Anna (called Marianne or Nannerl in the family), born\r\nJuly 30, 1751, and a son Wolfgang, born January 27, 1756.[10026] His\r\nbirth almost cost his mother her life, and her lingering recovery\r\noccasioned much anxiety to her friends.\r\n\r\nThe daughter showed so decided a talent for music, that her father early\r\nbegan to give her lessons on the clavier. This made a great impression\r\non her brother, then but three years old; he perched himself at the\r\nclavier, and amused himself by finding out thirds, which he struck\r\nwith much demonstration of delight; he also retained the more prominent\r\npassages in the pieces which he heard. In his fourth year his father\r\nbegan, in play, to teach him minuets and other pieces on the clavier;\r\nin a very short time he could play them with perfect correctness and in\r\nexact time. The impulse to produce something next awoke in him, and in\r\nhis fifth year he composed and played little pieces,\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(20)\r\n\r\nwhich his father then wrote down.[10027] A music-book which was intended\r\nfor Marianne's exercises, and preserved by her as a precious relic,\r\nwas in 1864 presented by the Grand Duchess Helene to the Mozarteum\r\nin Salzburg.[10028] It contains minuets and other little pieces, and\r\nfurther on longer ones, such as an air with twelve variations, and is\r\npartly filled with passages by the composers Agrell, Fischer, Wagenseil,\r\n&c., of increasing difficulty, for the purpose of instruction, in the\r\nhandwriting of the father and his musical friends. Wolfgang learned from\r\nthis book. The following note is appended by his father to the eighth\r\nminuet: \"Wolfgangerl learned this minuet in his fourth year.\" Similar\r\nremarks occur repeatedly; e.g., \"This minuet and trio were learned by\r\nWolfgangerl in half-an-hour, at half-past nine at night, on January 26,\r\n1761, one day before his fifth year.\" They are simple, easy pieces in\r\ntwo parts, but requiring an independence of the hands, not possible\r\nwithout a degree of musicial comprehension which is surprising in so\r\nyoung a child.\r\n\r\nThe first of Wolfgang's compositions have his father's superscription:\r\n\"Di Wolfgango Mozart, May 11, 1762, and July 16, 1762,\" little pieces\r\nmodelled on those he had practised, in which of course originality\r\nof invention cannot be looked for; but the sense of simple melody and\r\nrounded form so peculiar to Mozart are there already, without any trace\r\nof childish nonsense.\r\n\r\nThe book went with them on their travels, and Mozart used the blank\r\npages to write down pieces, which afterwards appeared in the first\r\npublished sonatas (1763).\r\n\r\nMost of the anecdotes of Mozart's childhood which testify to his\r\nwonderful genius, are contained in a letter from\r\n\r\n{SCHACHTNER.}\r\n\r\n(21)\r\n\r\nSchachtner, which is here given entire, as the direct testimony of a\r\ncontemporary.\r\n\r\nJoh. André Schachtner (died 1795) had been court trumpeter at Salzburg\r\nfrom 1754, for which post a higher degree of musical attainment was\r\nnecessary then than at the present day. He was not only a skilled\r\nmusician, but displayed considerable literary cultivation, which he\r\nhad obtained at the Jesuit school of Ingolstadt. The translation of a\r\nreligious drama, \"The Conversion of St. Augustine\" from the Latin of\r\nFather Franz Neumayer, gained him the somewhat ambiguous praise of\r\nGottsched, who writes: \"We may even say that he wrote good German, nay,\r\nalmost that he wrote good German poetry.\"[10029] We shall find him later\r\nacting as librettist to Mozart.\r\n\r\nHe was intimate in Mozart's home, and his warm attachment is proved by\r\nthe following interesting letter, written soon after Mozart's death to\r\nhis sister.[10030]\r\n\r\nDear and honoured Madam,--\r\n\r\nYour very welcome letter reached me, not at Salzburg, but at Hammerau,\r\nwhere I was visiting my son, who is coadjutor in the office of\r\nOberwesamtmann there.\r\n\r\nYou may judge from my habitual desire to oblige every one, more\r\nespecially those of the Mozart family, how much distressed I was at the\r\ndelay in discharging your commission. To the point therefore!\r\n\r\nYour first question is: \"What were the favourite amusements of your\r\nlate lamented brother in his childhood, apart from his passion for his\r\nmusic?\" To this question no reply can be made, for as soon as he began\r\nto give himself up to music, his mind was as good as dead to all\r\nother concerns,[10031] and even his childish games and toys had to be\r\naccompanied by music. When we, that is, he and I, carried his toys from\r\none room into another, the one of us who went empty-handed had always to\r\nsing a march and play the fiddle. But before he began to\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(22)\r\n\r\nstudy music he was so keenly alive to any childish fun that contained a\r\nspice of mischief, that even his meals would be forgotten for it. He was\r\nso excessively fond of me--I, as you know, being devoted to him--that he\r\nused to ask me over and over again whether I loved him; and when in joke\r\nI sometimes said \"No,\" great tears would come into his eyes, so tender\r\nand affectionate was his dear little heart.\r\n\r\nSecond question: \"How did he behave to great people when they admired\r\nhis talent and proficiency in music?\" In truth he betrayed very little\r\npride or veneration for rank,[10032] for, though he could best have\r\nshown both by playing before great people who understood little\r\nor nothing of music, he would never play unless there were musical\r\nconnoisseurs among his audience, or unless he could be deceived into\r\nthinking that there were.\r\n\r\nThird question: \"What was his favourite study?\" Answer: In this he\r\nsubmitted to the guidance of others. It was much the same to him what\r\nhe had to learn; he only wanted to learn, and left the choice of a\r\nfield for his labours to his beloved father.[10033] It appeared as if\r\nhe understood that he could not in all the world find a guide and\r\ninstructor like his ever memorable father.\r\n\r\nWhatever he had to learn he applied himself so earnestly to, that he\r\nlaid aside everything else, even his music. For instance, when he was\r\nlearning arithmetic, tables, stools, walls, and even the floor were\r\nchalked over with figures.[10034]\r\n\r\nFourth question: \"What particular qualities, maxims, rules of life,\r\nsingularities, good or evil propensities had he?\" Answer: He was full\r\nof fire; his inclinations were easily swayed: I believe that had he been\r\nwithout the advantage of the good education which he received, he might\r\nhave become a profligate scoundrel--he was so ready to yield to every\r\nattraction which offered.\r\n\r\nLet me add some trustworthy and astonishing facts relating to his fourth\r\nand fifth years, for the accuracy of which I can vouch.\r\n\r\nOnce I went with your father after the Thursday service to your house,\r\nwhere we found Wolfgangerl, then four years old, busy with his pen.\r\n\r\n{SCHACHTNER'S LETTER.}\r\n\r\n(23)\r\n\r\nFather: What are you doing?\r\n\r\nWolfg.: Writing a concerto for the clavier; it will soon be done.\r\n\r\nFather: Let me see it.\r\n\r\nWolfg.: It is not finished yet.\r\n\r\nFather: Never mind; let me see it. It must be something very fine.\r\n\r\nYour father took it from him and showed me a daub of notes, for the most\r\npart written over ink-blots. (The little fellow dipped his pen every\r\ntime down to the very bottom of the ink-bottle, so that as soon as it\r\nreached the paper, down fell a blot; but that did not disturb him in the\r\nleast, he rubbed the palm of his hand over it, wiped it off, and went\r\non with his writing.) We laughed at first at this apparent nonsense, but\r\nthen your father began to note the theme, the notes, the composition;\r\nhis contemplation of the page became more earnest, and at last tears of\r\nwonder and delight fell from his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Herr Schachtner,\" said he, \"how correct and how orderly it\r\nis; only it could never be of any use, for it is so extraordinarily\r\ndifficult that no one in the world could play it.\"\r\n\r\nThen Wolfgangerl struck in: \"That is why it is a concerto; it must be\r\npractised till it is perfect; look! this is how it goes.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to play, but could only bring out enough to show us what\r\nhe meant by it. He had at that time a firm conviction that playing\r\nconcertos and working miracles were the same thing.\r\n\r\nOnce more, honoured madam! You will doubtless remember that I have\r\na very good violin which Wolfgangerl used in old times to call\r\n\"Butter-fiddle,\" on account of its soft, full tone. One day, soon after\r\nyou came back from Vienna (early in 1763), he played on it, and could\r\nnot praise my violin enough; a day or two after, I came to see him\r\nagain, and found him amusing himself with his own little violin. He\r\nsaid directly: \"What is your butter-fiddle about?\" and went on playing\r\naccording to his fancy; then he thought a little and said:\r\n\r\n\"Herr Schachtner, your violin is half a quarter of a tone lower than\r\nmine, that is, if it is tuned as it was, when I played on it last.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed at this, but your father, who knew the wonderful ear and\r\nmemory of the child, begged me to fetch the violin, and see if he was\r\nright. I did, and right he was, sure enough!\r\n\r\nSome time before this, immediately after your return from Vienna,\r\nWolfgang having brought home with him a little violin which some one in\r\nVienna had given him, there came in one day our then excellent violinist\r\nthe late Herr Wentzl, who was a dabbler in composition.\r\n\r\nHe brought six trios with him, composed during the absence of your\r\nfather, whose opinion on them he came to ask. We played these trios,\r\nyour father taking the bass part, Wentzl playing first violin, and I\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nWolfgangerl begged to be allowed to play second violin, but your father\r\nreproved him for so silly a request, since he had never had any\r\n\r\n{CHILDHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(24)\r\n\r\ninstruction on the violin, and your father thought he was not in the\r\nleast able for it.\r\n\r\nWolfgang said, \"One need not have learnt, in order to play second\r\nviolin,\" whereupon his father told him to go away at once, and not\r\ninterrupt us any longer.\r\n\r\nWolfgang began to cry bitterly, and slunk away with his little violin. I\r\ninterceded for him to be allowed to play with me, and at last his father\r\nsaid: \"Play with Herr Schachtner then, but not so as to be heard, or you\r\nmust go away at once.\" So it was settled, and Wolfgang played with me.\r\nI soon remarked with astonishment that I was quite superfluous; I put my\r\nviolin quietly down, and looked at your father, down whose cheeks tears\r\nof wonder and delight were running; and so he played all the six trios.\r\nWhen we had finished, Wolfgang grew so bold from our applause that he\r\ndeclared he could play first violin. We let him try for the sake of the\r\njoke, and almost died of laughter to hear him play, with incorrect and\r\nuncertain execution, certainly, but never sticking fast altogether.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: Of the delicacy and refinement of his ear.\r\n\r\nUntil he was almost ten years old, he had an insurmountable horror of\r\nthe horn, when it was sounded alone, without other instruments; merely\r\nholding a horn towards him terrified him as much as if it had been a\r\nloaded pistol. His father wished to overcome this childish alarm, and\r\nordered me once, in spite of his entreaties, to blow towards him; but,\r\nO! that I had not been induced to do it. Wolfgang no sooner heard\r\nthe clanging sound than he turned pale, and would have fallen into\r\nconvulsions, had I not instantly desisted.\r\n\r\nThis is, I think, all I can say in answer to your questions. Forgive my\r\nscrawl, I am too much cast down to do better.\r\n\r\nI am, honoured Madam,\r\n\r\nWith the greatest esteem and affection,\r\n\r\nYour most obedient Servant,\r\n\r\nAndreas Schachtner,\r\n\r\nCourt Trumpeter.\r\n\r\nSalzburg,\r\n\r\n24 April 1792\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1001: An artist named Anton Mozart is mentioned by P. v.

EARLY JOURNEYS\r\n\r\nIt was in January of the year 1762 that L. Mozart first turned to\r\naccount the precocious talent of his children in an expedition to\r\nMunich. Their visit extended over three weeks, and both Wolfgang and his\r\nsister were summoned to play before the Elector, and were well received\r\neverywhere. Their success encouraged their father to a bolder attempt,\r\nand on September 19, of the same year, they set out for Vienna.[2001]\r\n\r\nTheir journey was made by easy stages. At Passau they remained for five\r\ndays, at the request of the Bishop, who wished to hear the boy-prodigy,\r\nand having done so, rewarded him with--one ducat! Thence they proceeded\r\nto Linz. Canon Count Herberstein travelled with them, and Wolfgang's\r\ndistress at seeing an old beggar-man fall into the water impressed him\r\nso much that, as Bishop of Passau, in 1785 he reminded L. Mozart of\r\nit. At Linz they gave a concert, under the patronage of Count Schlick,\r\nGovernor-General of the province. Count Palfy, a young nobleman who was\r\npaying his respects to the Countess Schlick on his way through Linz,\r\nheard from her such a glowing account of the boy-prodigy that he left\r\nhis travelling-carriage at the door of her residence and went with her\r\nto\r\n\r\n{EARLY JOURNEYS.}\r\n\r\n(26)\r\n\r\n\r\nthe concert; his amazement was unbounded. From Linz they continued\r\ntheir journey by water. At the Monastery of Ips, while their travelling\r\ncompanions, two Minorite monks and a Benedictine, were saying mass,\r\nWolfgang mounted to the organ-loft, and played so admirably that the\r\nFranciscan friars, and the guests they were entertaining, rose from\r\ntable and came open-mouthed with astonishment to listen to him.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at Vienna, Wolfgang saved his father the payment of\r\ncustoms duties. He made friends with the custom-house officer,\r\nshowed him his harpsichord, played him a minuet on his little fiddle,\r\nand--\"That passed us through!\" Throughout the journey Wolfgang showed\r\nhimself lively and intelligent, readily making friends, especially with\r\nofficials; his engaging manners attracted as much love as his playing\r\nexcited admiration.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the two children had preceded them to Vienna. Count Schlick,\r\nCount Herberstein, and Count Palfy had raised expectation to the highest\r\npitch, and the children were assured of a good reception at court\r\nand among the nobility, who vied with each other in their devotion to\r\neverything connected with art.\r\n\r\nThe imperial family took more than a passive interest in musical\r\naffairs.[2002] Charles VI. was an accomplished musician, and used to\r\naccompany operatic or other performances at court upon the clavier,[2003]\r\nplaying from the figured bass, according to the custom of conductors at\r\nthe time. He caused his daughters to study music, and the future Empress\r\nMaria Theresa displayed at an early age both taste and talent. In 1725,\r\nwhen only seven years old, she sang in an opera by Fux, at a fête given\r\nin honour of her mother, the Empress Elizabeth. It was in allusion\r\nto this that she once, joking, told Faustina Hasse that she believed\r\nherself to be the first\r\n\r\n{VIENNA, 1762--WAGENSEIL.}\r\n\r\n(27)\r\n\r\nof living virtuose.[2004] In 1739 she sang a duet with Senesino so\r\nbeautifully that the celebrated old singer was melted to tears.[2005] Her\r\nhusband, Francis I., was also musical, and gave his children a musical\r\neducation.[2006] The Archduchesses appeared frequently in operatic\r\nperformances at court, acquitting themselves \"very well for\r\nprincesses.\"[2007]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Joseph sang well, and played the harpsichord and the\r\nvioloncello.\r\n\r\nAnecdotes of Mozart's genius had excited much interest at court, and\r\non September 13, before he had even solicited the honour, L. Mozart\r\nreceived a command to bring his children to Schönbrunn. A quiet day was\r\nchosen, that the children might be heard without fear of interruption.\r\nTheir playing surpassed all expectation, and they were afterwards\r\nrepeatedly summoned to court. The Emperor took special delight in the\r\n\"little magician\" and enjoyed inventing new trials of skill for him.\r\nHe jestingly told him that playing with all his fingers was nothing;\r\nplaying with one finger would be true art; whereupon Wolfgang began to\r\nplay charmingly with only one finger. Another time he told him that\r\nit would be true art to play with the keyboard covered; and Wolfgang\r\ncovered the keys with a cloth, and played with as much decision and\r\nvivacity as if he could see them. This _tour de force_ was often\r\nrepeated on subsequent occasions, and always received with great\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nBut music was, generally speaking, a serious matter to Wolfgang, and\r\neven at court he refused to play except before connoisseurs. Once,\r\nseeing himself surrounded by a fashionable assemblage, he said before he\r\nbegan: \"Is Herr Wagenseil here? Let him come; he knows something about\r\nit.\" (Georg Christoph Wagenseil--born in Vienna, 1688; died, 1779)--was a\r\npupil of Fux, and one of the first\r\n\r\n\r\n{EARLY JOURNEYS.}\r\n\r\n(28)\r\n\r\nclavier-players and composers of his time: he taught the Empress and afterwards\r\nher children.[2008] The Emperor moved aside to let him come near Mozart,\r\nwho exclaimed: \"I am going to play one of your concertos; you must turn\r\nover for me.\" At court, as elsewhere, Mozart was a bright, happy child.\r\nHe would spring on the Empress's lap, throw his arms round her neck and\r\nkiss her, and play with the princesses on a footing of perfect equality.\r\nHe was especially devoted to the Archduchess Marie Antoinette. Once,\r\nwhen he fell on the polished floor, she lifted him from the ground and\r\nconsoled him, while one of her sisters stood by: \"You are good,\"\r\nsaid Wolfgang, \"I will marry you.\" The Empress asked him why? \"From\r\ngratitude,\" answered he; \"she was good to me, but her sister stood by\r\nand did nothing.\"[2009] The Emperor Joseph reminded him in after years of\r\nhis playing duets with Wagenseil, and of Mozart's standing in the\r\nantechamber among the audience, calling \"Pfui!\" or \"Bravo!\" or \"That was\r\nwrong!\" as the case might be.[20010]\r\n\r\nThe favour of the court was further displayed in substantial honours and\r\nrewards. In addition to a gift of money Marianne was presented with\r\na white silk court dress, belonging to one of the Archduchesses, and\r\nWolfgang with a violet coloured suit, trimmed with broad gold braid,\r\nthat had been made for the Archduke Maximilian. His father had his\r\nportrait painted in this magnificent attire. As might have been\r\nexpected, the children became the rage in society; \"all the ladies\r\nfell in love with the lad.\" The music-loving Prince von Hildburghausen,\r\nVice-Chancellor Count Colloredo, Bishop Esterhazy, all invited the\r\nMozarts; and before long they were indispensable at every fashionable\r\nassembly. They were generally carried to and fro in the carriage of\r\ntheir entertainers, and received many handsome presents of money and\r\ntrinkets. This prosperous course\r\n\r\n{SECOND JOURNEY, 1763.}\r\n\r\n(29)\r\n\r\nwas, however, suddenly interrupted by an attack of scarlet fever, which\r\nkept Wolfgang in bed for a fortnight. The dangerous part of his illness\r\nwas soon over, and the greatest sympathy was everywhere expressed for\r\nhim; but the fear of infection was then very great, and the interest\r\ntaken in his convalescence was accompanied by considerable reluctance to\r\nhis society.\r\n\r\nAn invitation from the Hungarian magnates induced L. Mozart, although he\r\nhad already exceeded his leave of absence, to undertake an expedition\r\nto Pressburg on December 11. The weather was very unfavourable, and\r\nmade the return journey through roadless Hungary not a little dangerous.\r\nTheir stay in Vienna was not much further prolonged, and early in\r\nJanuary, 1763, they found themselves once more in Salzburg.\r\n\r\nHaving once tested the powers and popularity of his children, Leopold\r\nMozart could not settle contentedly in Salzburg again, and he soon\r\ndetermined on the bolder venture of making their talents known beyond\r\nGermany. Paris was his ultimate goal, but he intended to exhibit the\r\nchildren at any of the German courts which did not lie too far out of\r\ntheir way. The class from which at the present day the musical public,\r\nproperly so called, is drawn was then altogether uncultivated; and even\r\nwhere there were no courts, as in the imperial towns, the nobles and\r\nrich merchants kept up similar distinctions of rank.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart lays complacent stress upon the fact that throughout their\r\ntour, their intercourse was confined to the nobility and distinguished\r\npersons, and that both for their health's sake and the reputation of\r\ntheir court, they were obliged to travel _noblement_. Being summer,\r\ntherefore, the travellers avoided the capitals and visited the country\r\nseats to which, at this season, the courts were wont to repair.[20011]\r\n\r\n{EARLY JOURNEYS.}\r\n\r\n(30)\r\n\r\nThe journey began on June 9, and not prosperously; for in Wasserbrunn\r\nthe carriage broke down, necessitating the delay of a whole day. \"The\r\nlast new thing is,\" writes the father, \"that in order to pass the time\r\nwe went to look at the organ, and I explained the pedal to Wolferl. He\r\nset to work to try it on the spot; pushed aside the stool, and preluded\r\naway standing, using the pedal as if he had practised it for months. We\r\nwere all lost in astonishment. What has caused others months of\r\npractice comes to him as a gift of God.\" Wolfgang performed on the organ\r\nconstantly throughout the journey, and was, his father says, even more\r\nadmired as an organist than as a clavier-player.\r\n\r\nArrived at Munich on June 12, 1763, they proceeded at once to\r\nNymphenburg, the summer residence of the Elector. Here the introduction\r\nof the Prince von Zweibrücken gained them a favourable reception,\r\nand they played repeatedly before the Elector and Duke Clement; it is\r\nspecially mentioned that Wolfgang executed a concerto on the violin with\r\ncadenzas \"out of his own head.\" Here they fell in with two travellers\r\nfrom Saxony, the Barons Hopfgarten and Bose, with whom they formed a\r\ncordial friendship, cemented during their stay in Paris. At Augsburg\r\nthey took up their abode for a fortnight with the Mozart family, and\r\ngave three concerts, at which the audience were almost exclusively\r\nLutherans. The Salzburg \"Europàische Zeitung\" (July 19, 1763) reports\r\nfrom Augsburg, July 9:--\r\n\r\nThe day before yesterday, Herr Leopold Mozart, Vice-Kapellmeister\r\nat Salzburg, left this place for Stuttgart, with his two precocious\r\nchildren. The inhabitants of his native town have fully appreciated\r\nthe privilege accorded them in witnessing the manifestation of the\r\nmarvellous gifts bestowed by Providence on these charming children; they\r\nrecognise also how great must have been the paternal care, the result\r\nof which has been the production of a girl of eleven and, what is still\r\nmore incredible, a boy of seven years old as ornaments to the musical\r\nworld. The opinion pronounced on these prodigies by a correspondent from\r\nVienna, which will be found on another page, enthusiastic as it appears,\r\nwill be confirmed by all musical connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nAt Ludwigsburg, the summer residence of the Wurtemburg court, they did\r\nnot succeed in obtaining audience of the Duke, although they had brought\r\nintroductions from\r\n\r\n{LUDWIGSBURG, 1763--JOMELLI.}\r\n\r\n(31)\r\n\r\nCanon Count Wolfegg, both to the Master of the Hunt, Bar. v. Pölnitz,\r\nand to Jomelli. L. Mozart was inclined to ascribe this to the influence\r\nof Jomelli, who figured as Kapellmeister from 1754 to 1768,[20012] with a\r\nsalary of 4,000 fl. (more correctly 3,000 fl.), the keep of four horses,\r\nfuel and lights, a house in Stuttgart and another at Ludwigsburg, and\r\n2,000 fl. pension for his widow. Leopold Mozart announces all this\r\nto Hagenauer, with the question: \"What do you think of that for a\r\nKapellmeister's pay?\" He maintained that all native artists had to\r\nsuffer from Jomelli's influence, who spared no trouble to drive Germans\r\nfrom the court and to admit none but Italians; this was the more\r\npossible, as he was in high favour with the Duke.\r\n\r\nHe and his countrymen, of whom his house was always full, were reported\r\nto have said that it was incredible that a child of German birth could\r\nhave such musical genius, and so much spirit and fire. _Ridete Amici!_\r\nhe adds. Granted, however, that musical taste in Ludwigsburg had been\r\nthoroughly Italianised by Jomelli's influence and position,[20013] there\r\nis no doubt that this account of him is prejudiced and exaggerated.\r\nMetastasio pictures him as courteous and affable,[20014] and in Stuttgart\r\nhe had the reputation of giving all due credit to German artists,[20015]\r\nso that L. Mozart's accusation is probably without much foundation. He\r\nhimself acknowledges that Jomelli's unlimited power had been principally\r\nthe cause of the excellence of musical performances in Ludwigsburg;\r\nthough here again, Schubart complains that the orchestra was spoilt by\r\nthe numerous amateur members who could not agree, and who were fond\r\nof introducing ornamentations in their separate parts, quite out of\r\ncharacter with the whole.[20016]\r\n\r\nOf the really superior amateurs who were then at\r\n\r\n{EARLY JOURNEYS.}\r\n\r\n(32)\r\n\r\nLudwigsburg L. Mozart mentions only Tartini's pupil, P. Nardini (died\r\n1793) who \"was unsurpassed in taste, purity, and delicacy of tone, but\r\nnot by any means a powerful player.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Ludwigsburg they proceeded to Schwetzingen, and presenting\r\nrecommendations from the Prince von Zweibrücken and Prince Clement of\r\nBavaria, were well received by the Elector Palatine Karl Theodor. On\r\nJuly 18 the court assembled to hear them from five to nine o'clock; the\r\nchildren set all Schwetzingen in commotion, and the electoral household\r\nwere enchanted with them. L. Mozart praises the admirable flute-playing\r\nof Wendling, and speaks of the orchestra as the best in Germany,\r\nbeing entirely composed of young men of good birth, who were \"neither\r\ntipplers, nor gamblers, nor miserable ragamuffins\" (a hit at Salzburg),\r\nand who were as estimable in their private as in their professional\r\ncapacity. He goes on to inform pious Frau Hagenauer, that since they\r\nleft Wasser-burg they had found no holy water, and rarely a crucifix\r\nin their bedrooms, and that they found it difficult to procure fast-day\r\nmeals: \"Everybody eats meat, and perhaps so have we, without knowing it.\r\nAfter all, it is no fault of ours!\"\r\n\r\nMaking an excursion to Heidelberg, Wolfgang played the organ in the\r\nChurch of the Holy Spirit, and so astonished his audience that the Dean\r\nordered his name and the particulars of his visit to be inscribed as a\r\nmemorial of it on the organ. Unfortunately no trace of the inscription\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nAt Mayence, owing to the illness of the Elector, Joseph Emnrerich (von\r\nBreidtbach), they could not appear at court, but made 200 florins at\r\nthree concerts. Here they met the singer, Marianne de Amicis, who was\r\nreturning with her family from London.\r\n\r\nAt Frankfort, which they went out of their way to visit, Mozart's first\r\nconcert, on August 18, was so successful that they decided on giving\r\nthree more. The newspaper announcement, of August 30, 1763, shows\r\nwhat an astonishing performance was offered to the public. It runs as\r\nfollows:[20017]--\r\n\r\n{FRANKFORT, COBLENZ, COLOGNE.}\r\n\r\n(33)\r\n\r\nThe universal admiration excited in the minds of the audience by the\r\nastounding genius of the two children of Herr L. Mozart, Kapellmeister\r\nat the Court of Salzburg, has necessitated the threefold repetition of\r\nthe concert which was announced to take place on one occasion only.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, therefore, of this universal admiration, and in\r\ndeference to the desire of many distinguished connoisseurs, the next\r\nand positively the last concert will take place this evening, Tuesday,\r\nAugust 30, in the Scharfischen Saal, on the Liebfraoenberge.\r\n\r\nThe little girl, who is in her twelfth year, will play the most\r\ndifficult compositions of the greatest masters; the boy, who is not yet\r\nseven, will perform on the clavecin or harpsichord; he will also play a\r\nconcerto for the violin, and will accompany symphonies on the clavier,\r\nthe manual or keyboard being covered with a cloth, with as much facility\r\nas if he could see the keys; he will instantly name all notes played at\r\na distance, whether singly or in chords on the clavier, or on any\r\nother instrument, bell, glass, or clock. He will finally, both on the\r\nharpsichord and the organ, improvise as long as may be desired and in\r\nany key, thus proving that he is as thoroughly acquainted with the\r\none instrument as with the other, great as is the difference between\r\nthem.[20018]\r\n\r\nHere, too, Goethe heard him. \"I saw him as a boy, seven years old,\" he\r\ntold Eckermann, \"when he gave a concert on one of his tours. I myself\r\nwas fourteen, and I remember the little fellow distinctly with his\r\npowdered wig and his sword.\"[20019]\r\n\r\nAt Coblenz, Mozart was presented to the Elector of Treves, Johann\r\nPhilipp (von Walderdorf), by Baron Walderdorf and the Imperial\r\nAmbassador, Count Bergen, and appeared at court on September 18. He was\r\nalso frequently invited by the Privy Councillor and Imperial Knight von\r\nKerpen, whose seven sons and two daughters all either sang or played\r\nsome instrument. At Bonn, the Elector of Cologne, Maximilian Freidrich\r\n(Count of Konigseck-Rothenfels), being absent, they only remained long\r\nenough to see and admire the splendours of the residential palace;\r\nthe magnificent beds, the baths, the picture galleries, concert halls,\r\ndecorations, inlaid tables, chairs, &c.; also the numerous curiosities\r\nat Poppelsdorf and Falkenlust. At Cologne, on the other hand, they only\r\nnote the \"dingy cathedral.\" At Aix, the Princess Amalie, sister\r\n\r\n{EARLY JOURNEYS.}\r\n\r\n(34)\r\n\r\nto Frederick the Great, and a zealous lover and patroness of music, was\r\ntaking the waters. She endeavoured to persuade L. Mozart to take his\r\nchildren to Berlin, but he would not alter his plans.\r\n\r\n\"She has no money,\" writes the practical man. \"If the kisses she bestows\r\non my children, particularly on Master Wolfgang, were each a louis\r\nd'or, we should be well off; as it is, neither our hotel bill nor our\r\npost-horses can be paid with kisses.\" At Brussels, where Prince Charles\r\nof Lorraine, brother of the Emperor Francis I., resided as Governor\r\nand Captain-General of the Austrian Netherlands, they were delayed some\r\ntime, but succeeded in giving a grand concert.\r\n\r\nThence they proceeded direct to Paris, where they arrived on November\r\n18, and were kindly received and hospitably entertained by the Bavarian\r\nambassador, Count von Eyck. His wife was a daughter of the high\r\nchamberlain at Salzburg, Count Arco. Mozart was furnished with\r\nintroductions to the most distinguished persons then in Paris; but\r\nall these were worth nothing, L. Mozart writes, in comparison with one\r\nletter given to him by a merchant's wife at Frankfort, and addressed\r\nto Grimm. Friedrich Melchior Grimm, the pupil and disciple of\r\nGottsched,[20020] had lived in Paris since 1749. As secretary to Count\r\nFriesen, and afterwards to the Duke of Orleans, he had admission to the\r\nhighest circles of society. His amiable disposition and the important\r\nshare he took in the literary struggles of the encyclopedists gained\r\nhim a still more exalted position as a sort of literary and artistic\r\narbiter. His judgment on musical matters was eagerly sought after, and,\r\nas it came within his special province to bring to light anything out\r\nof the common way, he was of all others most fitted to appreciate\r\nWolfgang's performances. He had genuine sympathy with his countrymen,\r\ntoo, and could understand such a nature as L. Mozart's. He had not yet\r\nbeen created baron and ambassador, was still active and energetic, and\r\nexerted all his personal and literary influence for the Mozart family.\r\nLeopold ascribes\r\n\r\n\r\n{PARIS--1763-64, GRIMM, MDME. DE POMPADOUR.}\r\n\r\n( 35)\r\n\r\nall their subsequent success to this \"powerful friend.\" \"He has done\r\neverything--opened the court to us, managed the first concert, and is\r\ngoing to manage the second. What cannot a man do with sense and a kind\r\nheart? He has been fifteen years in Paris, and knows how to make things\r\nfall out as he wishes.\"\r\n\r\nTheir first object was the introduction at court. The most important\r\npersonage at that time at Versailles was, of course, Madame de\r\nPompadour. \"She must have been very beautiful,\" writes L. Mozart to\r\nMadame Hagenauer, \"for she is still comely. She is tall and stately;\r\nstout, but well proportioned, with some likeness to Her Imperial Majesty\r\nabout the eyes. She is proud, and has a remarkable mind.\" Mozart's\r\nsister remembered in after days how she placed little Wolfgang on the\r\ntable before her, but pushed him aside when he bent forward to kiss her,\r\non which he indignantly asked: \"Who is this that does not want to kiss\r\nme?--the Empress kissed me.\"[20021] The King's daughters were much more\r\nfriendly, and, contrary to all etiquette, kissed and played with the\r\nchildren, both in their own apartments and in the public corridors. On\r\nNew Year's Day the Mozart family were conducted by the Swiss guard to\r\nthe supper-room of the royal family. Wolfgang stood near the Queen,\r\nwho fed him with sweetmeats, and talked to him in German, which she was\r\nobliged to interpret to Louis XV. The father stood near Wolfgang, and\r\nthe mother and daughter on the other side of the King, near the Dauphin\r\nand Madame Adelaide.\r\n\r\nOnce having played at Versailles, they were sure of access to the most\r\ndistinguished society.[20022]A small oil painting, now in the Museum at\r\nVersailles, shows little Wolfgang at the clavier in the _salon_ of\r\nPrince Conti, the centre of an assemblage of great people. Finally,\r\nhaving established their\r\n\r\n(36)\r\n\r\n{EARLY JOURNEYS.}\r\n\r\nposition in private society they gave two great concerts (on March 10\r\nand April 9, 1764) in the rooms of a certain fashionable M. Felix, who\r\nhad built a little theatre for private representations. The permission\r\nto give these concerts was a favour obtained with difficulty, as they\r\ninfringed the privileges both of the Concert Spirituel and of the\r\nFrench and Italian theatres. The result was in every respect a brilliant\r\nsuccess. Marianne Mozart played the most difficult compositions of the\r\nmusicians then living in Paris, especially of Schobert and Eckart, with\r\na precision and correctness that could not have been surpassed by the\r\nmasters themselves.\r\n\r\nSchobert was a native of Strasburg, cembalist to the Prince de Conti;\r\nas a composer he was famous for his grace and fire, especially in\r\nallegros,[20023] but as a man he was not all he should have been, according\r\nto L. Mozart. He was a false flatterer, his religion was _à la mode_,\r\nand his envy was often so ill-concealed as to excite ridicule. Eckart,\r\non the contrary, was a worthy man, and quite free from jealousy; he\r\nhad come from Augsburg to Paris in 1758, and was highly esteemed as a\r\nclavier-player and teacher.\r\n\r\nWolfgang's performances on the clavier, organ, and violin, extraordinary\r\nas they were, were thrown into the shade by the proofs he gave of almost\r\nincredible musical genius.[20024] He not only accompanied at sight Italian\r\nand French airs, but he transposed them [prima vista].\r\n\r\nAt that time, accompanying meant more than the playing of prepared\r\npassages for the piano or clavier; it involved the choice at the moment\r\nof a fitting accompaniment for the\r\n\r\n{FIRST PRINTED COMPOSITIONS.}\r\n\r\n(37)\r\n\r\nseveral parts of the score, or the supplying of harmonies to the bass.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the simplicity of the harmony, and the adherence to\r\ncertain fixed forms, gave to such exercises facilities not afforded\r\nby the license and want of form of modern music. Grimm relates in\r\nhis correspondence a truly astonishing instance of the boy's genius.\r\nWolfgang accompanied a lady in an Italian air without seeing the music,\r\nsupplying the harmony for the passage which was to follow from that\r\nwhich he had just heard. This could not be done without some mistakes,\r\nbut when the song was ended he begged the lady to sing it again, played\r\nthe accompaniment and the melody itself with perfect correctness, and\r\nrepeated it ten times, altering the character of the accompaniment for\r\neach. On a melody being dictated to him, he supplied the bass and the\r\nparts without using the clavier at all; he showed himself in all ways\r\nso accomplished that his father was convinced he would obtain service at\r\ncourt on his return home. Leopold Mozart now thought the time was come\r\nfor introducing the boy as a composer, and he printed four sonatas for\r\nthe piano and violin, rejoicing at the idea of the noise which they\r\nwould make in the world, appearing with the announcement on the\r\ntitle-page that they were the work of a child of seven years old.\r\nHe thought well of these sonatas, independently of their childish\r\nauthorship; one andante especially \"shows remarkable taste.\" When it\r\nhappened that in the last trio of Op. 2, a mistake of the young master,\r\nwhich his father had corrected (consisting of three consecutive fifths\r\nfor the violin), was printed, he consoled himself by reflecting that\r\n\"they can serve as a proof that Wolfgangerl wrote the sonatas himself,\r\nwhich, naturally, not every one would believe.\" The little composer\r\ndedicated his first printed sonatas (6, 7, K.), to the good-natured\r\nPrincesse Victoire, both she and her sisters being very fond of music.\r\nThe next (8,9, K.), were dedicated to the amiable and witty Comtesse de\r\nTessê, lady-in-waiting to the Dauphiness.\r\n\r\nGrimm had written a dedication in Mozart's name, in which both he and\r\nthe Dauphiness were well touched off.\r\n\r\n{FIRST JOURNEY.}\r\n\r\n(38)\r\n\r\nTo L. Mozart's vexation she declined it as too eulogistic, and a simpler\r\none had to be substituted.\r\n\r\nThe prodigies were overwhelmed with distinctions, complimentary verses,\r\nand gifts. M. de Carmontelle, an admirable amateur portrait painter,\r\nmade a charming picture of the family group;[20025] it was engraved by\r\nDelafosse at Grimm's instigation.\r\n\r\nThe unprecedented success of the two children was the more significant\r\nsince musical culture was not nearly so predominant in Paris as in most\r\nof the German courts. \"It is a pity,\" says Grimm, \"that people in this\r\ncountry understand so little of music.\"\r\n\r\nL. Mozart notes the standing war between French and Italian music, and\r\nthe position which Grimm took up on the side of the Italians served to\r\nconfirm him in his preconceived opinions. According to him none of\r\nthe French music was worth a groat; in church music all the solos and\r\neverything approaching to an air, were \"empty, cold, and wretched,\r\nin fact French.\" But he did justice to the choruses, and lost no\r\nopportunity of letting his son hear them.[20026] In instrumental music\r\nthe German composers, among them Schobert, Eckart, and Hannauer, were\r\nbeginning to make their influence felt, so much so that Le Grand[20027]\r\nabandoned the French style and composed sonatas after German models.\r\nThe revolution to be wrought by Gluck, was as yet, indeed, not to be\r\nforeseen; but L. Mozart hoped that in ten or fifteen years the French\r\nstyle would be extinguished.\r\n\r\nOn April 10, 1764, the Mozart family left Paris. At Calais, Marianne\r\nnotes in her diary, \"how the sea runs away and comes back again.\" Thence\r\nthey crossed to Dover in a small vessel, the packet being over full, and\r\nwere very sea-sick; an experienced courier, whom they had brought with\r\nthem from Paris, arranged the journey direct\r\n\r\n{LONDON, 1764-65.}\r\n\r\n(39)\r\n\r\nto London.[20028] They were heard at court on April 27, and their reception\r\nsurpassed all expectation. \"The favour shown to us by both royal\r\npersonages is incredible,\" writes L. Mozart; \"we should never imagine\r\nfrom their familiar manner that they were the King and Queen of England.\r\nWe have met with extraordinary politeness at every court, but this\r\nsurpasses them all. A week ago we were walking in St. James's Park; the\r\nKing and Queen drove past, and although we were differently dressed,\r\nthey recognised us, and the King leant out of the window smiling and\r\nnodding, especially towards Wolfgang.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge III. was a connoisseur and passionate admirer of Handel's music,\r\nand Queen Charlotte sang and played; both had German taste, and\r\ngave special honour to German artists, as Jos. Haydn found in later\r\nyears.[20029] The Mozarts were summoned to court on May 19, and played\r\nbefore a limited circle from six to ten o'clock. Pieces by Wagenseil,\r\nBach, Abel, and Handel were placed by the King before the \"invincible\"\r\nWolfgang, who played them all at sight; he surpassed his clavier-playing\r\nwhen he sat down to the King's organ; he accompanied the Queen in a\r\nsong, a flute-player in a solo, and, finally, he took the bass of an\r\nair by Handel and improvised a charming melody to it. None took more\r\ninterest in the young musician than the Queen's music-master, Joh.\r\nChristian Bach,[20030] the son of Sebastian Bach, settled in London since\r\n1762, and the author of several popular operas and numerous pianoforte\r\ncompositions. He looked upon his art after an easy careless fashion;\r\nbut his kindness and goodwill won Wolfgang's heart for ever. He liked to\r\nplay with the boy; took him upon his knee and went through a sonata with\r\nhim, each in turn playing a bar with so much precision that no one would\r\nhave suspected two performers. He began a fugue, which Wolfgang took up\r\nand completed when Bach broke off.\r\n\r\n{FIRST JOURNEY.}\r\n\r\n(40)\r\n\r\nAt last L. Mozart thought the time had come to introduce to the public\r\n\"the greatest wonder of which Europe or the world can boast,\" as the\r\ngrandiloquent announcement ran. Not without due calculation, the concert\r\nwas fixed for June 5, the King's birthday, which was sure to bring a\r\nlarge public to London. The speculation succeeded, and L. Mozart \"was\r\nterrified\" by taking one hundred guineas in three hours--a satisfactory\r\nsum to send home. On the 29th Wolfgang played at a concert given\r\nat Ranelagh Gardens, with a charitable object, and \"astonished and\r\ndelighted the greatest connoisseurs in England.\" This prosperous career\r\nwas, however, temporarily cut short; Leopold Mozart was seized with\r\ndangerous inflammation of the throat, and retired with his children to\r\nChelsea, where they remained seven weeks before his cure was completed.\r\nDuring this time Wolfgang, out of consideration for his father, left his\r\ninstrument untouched; but he set to work to write orchestral symphonies,\r\nand his sister tells[20031] how he said to her, sitting near: \"Remind me\r\nto give something really good to the horn.\" The horn was at that time\r\na favourite instrument in England, and in many of Wolfgang's youthful\r\ncompositions it has a prominent part. The first symphony, in E flat\r\nmajor (1 K.), in the three usual movements, has many corrections which\r\nthe boy made, partly to improve the instrumentation, partly to moderate\r\nthe too rapid transition to the principal theme of the first movement.\r\nOriginality is scarcely to be expected, but it is something that a due\r\nregard to form and continuity should be everywhere apparent. He worked\r\nso diligently that at the next concert it was announced that all the\r\ninstrumental pieces were of Wolfgang's composition. Three symphonies\r\n(17,18,19, K.), in B flat major (with two minuets, the instrumentation\r\nnot quite complete), in E flat major (with clarinets, instead of oboes,\r\nand bassoons), and in D major (Londra, 1765), which all fall within the\r\nLondon visit, show marked progress. The subjects are better defined,\r\nthe disposition of the parts is freer and more orchestral, and some\r\ninstrumental effects\r\n\r\n{LONDON, 1764-65.}\r\n\r\n(41)\r\n\r\nbegin to be heard. On October 29, they were in town again, and invited\r\nto court to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the King's accession. As\r\na memento of the royal favour, L. Mozart printed six sonatas for piano\r\nand violin or flute, composed by Wolfgang, and dedicated to the Queen on\r\nJanuary 18, 1765, which dedication she rewarded with a present of fifty\r\nguineas.[20032] The opening of the Italian Opera House on November 24,\r\n1764, had no small influence on Wolfgang's genius; here, for the first\r\ntime, he heard singers of note. Giovanni Manzuoli (born in Florence,\r\n1720),[20033] whose singing and acting were then exciting the London public\r\nto the highest enthusiasm,[20034] became acquainted with the Mozart family,\r\nand gave Wolfgang lessons in singing. His voice was, of course, a boyish\r\ntreble; his style that of an artist. The following year, in Paris, Grimm\r\ndeclared that he had so profited by Manzuoli's instruction as to sing\r\nwith extreme taste and feeling, notwithstanding the weakness of his\r\nvoice. Thus early did Mozart acquire, as if by natural instinct, all the\r\nrequisites for a great composer which are, to most men, the result of\r\nyears of painful study.\r\n\r\nDuring Lent, he enjoyed the opportunity of hearing Handel's Oratorios,\r\nbut we hear nothing of any special influence which they may have had\r\non his mind; indeed, he knew little of Handel in later years, until Van\r\nSwieten made him acquainted with his works.\r\n\r\nOn February 21, the \"Wonder of Nature\" reappeared in public at a concert\r\nwhich had been often postponed. The political situation and the illness\r\nof the king made the time an unfavourable one, and the receipts were not\r\nso great as had been expected.\r\n\r\nAnother concert, on May 13, took place only after repeated announcements\r\nof the approaching departure of the Wonder of Nature, and at a reduced\r\nrate. \"It was quite enchanting,\" declares the \"Salzburger Zeitung\"[20035]\r\n\"to hear the sister\r\n\r\n{FIRST JOURNEY.}\r\n\r\n(42)\r\n\r\nof twelve years old play the most difficult sonatas on the harpsichord,\r\nwhile her brother accompanied her impromptu on another harpsichord.\"\r\nWolfgang performed on a harpsichord with two manuals and a pedal which\r\nthe musical instrument maker Tschudi had constructed for the King of\r\nPrussia;[20036] Tschudi \"rejoiced that his extraordinary harpsichord should\r\nbe played for the first time by the most extraordinary performer in the\r\nworld.\" After this, L. Mozart repeatedly invited the public to hear and\r\ntest the young wonder in private daily from twelve to two o'clock; at\r\nfirst these performances took place in their own lodging, afterwards\r\nin a tavern, not of the first rank. It was promised as something\r\nextraordinary that the two children should play a duet on the same\r\nclavier with the keyboard covered. It was for these occasions that\r\nWolfgang composed his first duet, according to L. Mozart, the first\r\nsonata for four hands ever written.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Daines Barrington, a man highly esteemed as a lawyer and a\r\nphilosopher, undertook a repeated and searching trial of the boy's\r\nskill, and has left a circumstantial report of the result.[20037] He\r\nobtained a copy of Wolfgang's registry of baptism, in order to be sure\r\nof his age, and made other minute inquiries concerning him. Besides the\r\nusual tests of playing difficult pieces at sight, and of singing and\r\naccompanying with proper expression a score hitherto unknown to him, he\r\ndemanded an improvisation. He told Mozart to improvise a love-song such\r\nas Manzuoli might sing in some opera. The boy at once pronounced\r\nsome words to serve as a recitative, then followed an air on the word\r\n_affetto_ (love) of about the length of an ordinary love-song in the\r\nregulation two parts. In the same way he composed a song expressive of\r\nanger on the word _perfido_ which excited him so much, that he struck\r\nthe clavier like one possessed, and several times sprang up from his\r\nseat. Barrington remarks that these improvised compositions, if not very\r\nastonishing, are\r\n\r\n{HOLLAND, 1765.}\r\n\r\n(43)\r\n\r\nyet far above the ordinary run, and give proofs of decided inventive\r\npower. Not only has Mozart's technical education so far advanced, that\r\nhe handles freely the forms and rules of composition; he begins now to\r\ndisplay the inspired imagination of an artistic genius.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the first stirrings of the dramatic element\r\nin Mozart, and how he was able already to give articulate expression to\r\nvarious passions as they were suggested to him.\r\n\r\nAn instance of this is a tenor song, \"Va dal furor portata\" (21 K.),\r\ncomposed in London, 1765, in which the Da capo form is rigorously\r\nadhered to, and which, though wanting in originality displays much sense\r\nof characteristic expression.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of their London stay they visited the British Museum,\r\nthe natural history and ethnographical curiosities being duly noted\r\nby Marianne. In deference to an expressed wish, Wolfgang presented the\r\nMuseum with his printed sonatas and with a manuscript composition (20\r\nK.), consisting of a short madrigal in four parts, \"God is our Refuge,\"\r\nthe melody being possibly suggested.[20038] Notwithstanding this, the\r\ntreatment of it is an extraordinary proof not only of the boy's skill,\r\nbut of his readiness in apprehending and adhering to an unaccustomed\r\nform.[20039]\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 1765, they left London, remained one day in Canterbury, and\r\npassed the rest of the month at the country seat of Sir Horace Mann.\r\nIn obedience to the repeated and earnest solicitations of the Dutch\r\nAmbassador, speaking as the mouthpiece of the Princess Caroline, of\r\nNassau-Weilburg, L. Mozart, contrary to his original plan, consented to\r\nvisit the Hague. He probably lays stress on this pressing invitation to\r\nexcuse his lengthened absence from Salzburg. His leave of absence had\r\nlong ago expired,\r\n\r\n{FIRST JOURNEY.}\r\n\r\n(44)\r\n\r\nand he was repeatedly urged to hasten his return; but he was firmly\r\nresolved with God's help, to carry out what he had begun. They had\r\nproceeded as far on their journey as Lille, when Wolfgang was seized\r\nwith an illness which necessitated a delay of four weeks, and from which\r\nhe had not quite recovered when he was in Ghent playing on the great\r\norgan of the Church of St. Bernard. They reached the Hague in the\r\nbeginning of September, and met with a very gracious reception from\r\nthe Prince of Orange and his sister the Princess of Weilburg. But now,\r\nMarianne, in her turn fell dangerously ill; was delirious for a week\r\ntogether, and received the last sacrament. \"No one,\" writes the father,\r\n\"could have heard unmoved the interview between myself, my wife, and\r\ndaughter, and how we convinced the latter of the vanity of the world and\r\nthe blessedness of early death, while Wolfgang was amusing himself with\r\nhis music in another room.\" They did not neglect to have masses for\r\nMarianne's recovery said in Salzburg.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday that she was at her worst, Leopold opened the Gospel at\r\nthe words: \"Lord, come down, ere my child die;\" but a new treatment of\r\nthe case by Herr Schwenckel, physician to the Princess of Weilburg,\r\nwas so successful, that he was soon able to acknowledge the prophetic\r\nsignificance of the words: \"Thy daughter sleeps; thy faith hath saved\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely was the father relieved from this anxiety when he was subjected\r\nto a still greater trial. Wolfgang was seized with a violent attack of\r\nfever, which reduced him to extreme weakness for several weeks. But even\r\nillness did not cripple the boy's mental activity. He insisted on having\r\na board laid across his bed, on which he could write; and even when his\r\nlittle fingers refused their accustomed service he could scarcely be\r\npersuaded to cease writing and playing.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1766, we find him composing a song, \"Conservati fedele\" (23\r\nK.), for the Princess of Weilburg, which consists of a pleasant, flowing\r\nmelody, and here and there characteristic touches, happily expressed by\r\nchanges of harmony.\r\n\r\n{HOLLAND, 1765-66.}\r\n\r\n(45)\r\n\r\nHe was able before the end of this month to go on to Amsterdam, where\r\nthey spent four weeks. Wolfgang gave two concerts at which all the\r\ninstrumental pieces were of his own composition. Among them was a\r\nSymphony in B flat major (22 K.), in three movements, which had been\r\nwritten at the Hague, and which contains noteworthy instances of\r\nthematic elaboration and well-rounded phrasing. Although it was Lent,\r\nand all public amusements were strictly forbidden, these concerts were\r\npermitted because the \"exhibition of the marvellous gifts of these\r\nchildren redounds to the glory of God,\" a resolution which, though it\r\nwas formulated by Lutherans, was nevertheless cordially accepted by so\r\ndevout a Catholic as L. Mozart.\r\n\r\nOn March 8, 1766, they travelled back to the Hague, to assist at the\r\nfestivities given in honour of the Prince of Orange, who came of age\r\non that day. Wolfgang was ordered to compose six sonatas for piano\r\nand violin for the Princess of Weilburg, which were printed with a\r\ndedication (26 to 31, K.). In addition, he wrote several songs for the\r\nsame princess, and other \"trifles,\" which were also printed, among them\r\npianoforte variations on an air composed for the occasion (24 K.),\r\nand upon another air, \"which is sung, played, and whistled all over\r\nHolland.\" This was the song, \"Wilhelmus von Nassau,\"[20040] written and\r\ncomposed by Philipp von Mamix (d. 1598), on the Prince of Orange (d.\r\n1584), which soon spread far and wide[20041] and became the national song\r\nof Holland. Mattheson cites it as an instance of a national war-song,\r\nwhich had inspired a whole people to great deeds, and had played an\r\nimportant part in the war and in the celebration of peace, in 1749.[20042]\r\nFor one concert, Wolfgang composed an orchestral piece after the manner\r\nof a \"Concerto grosso,\" in which a clavier obbligato was introduced with\r\nthe other instruments and called it a \"Galimathias musicum.\" Sketches\r\nfor this in Wolfgang's handwriting, with his father's corrections here\r\nand there, have\r\n\r\n{FIRST JOURNEY.}\r\n\r\n(46)\r\n\r\nbeen preserved (32 K).[20043] After an easy andante, which serves as an\r\nintroduction, come thirteen movements, generally only in two parts,\r\nvarying both in measure and time. There is a variety of instrumentation\r\nunmistakably present, and the horns are specially favoured; there is one\r\npassage which imitates the bagpipes.\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThe whole winds up with an elaborate movement on the first part of the\r\nnational song--\r\n\r\nwhich is partly fugued, partly worked out in a free imitation, showing,\r\nas one might expect, the uncertain hand of a boy. But it is plain that\r\nhe was considered as an established composer. His father's talent, too,\r\nmet with flattering recognition; his Violin Method was translated into\r\nDutch, and dedicated to the Prince of Orange on his accession.[20044] The\r\npublisher brought it to Leopold Mozart, accompanied by the organist, who\r\ninvited Wolfgang to play on the great organ at Haarlem, which he did on\r\nthe following day. At length they travelled by way of Mechlin to Paris,\r\nwhere they arrived on May 10, and established themselves in a lodging\r\nprovided by their friend Grimm. The progress made both by Wolfgang\r\nand his sister was acknowledged by all; but the public are more easily\r\nexcited by the phenomenal performances of an infant prodigy than by the\r\nincomparably more important development of an extraordinary genius, and\r\nthe interest in the children does not appear to have been so great as on\r\ntheir former visit. Nevertheless, they played repeatedly at Versailles;\r\nthe Princess of Orleans, afterwards Duchess of Condé, thought herself\r\nhonoured in presenting Wolfgang with a little rondo for piano and\r\nviolin of her own composition.[20045] Prince Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand von\r\nBraunschweig, the Braunschweig Achilles, as Winckelmann calls him,[20046]\r\nwho\r\n\r\n{PARIS, SWITZERLAND, 1766.}\r\n\r\n(47)\r\n\r\nhad won his laurels in the seven years' war, sought them out in Paris.\r\n\"He is pleasant, handsome, and amiable,\" writes L. Mozart, \"and as soon\r\nas I went in, he asked me if I were the author of the Violin School.\" He\r\nhad not only intelligence and good taste in music, but played the violin\r\nhimself so well \"that he might have made his fortune by it.\"[20047] He said\r\nof Wolfgang that many a kapellmeister had lived and died without having\r\nlearnt as much as the boy knew now. He entered into competition with the\r\nmost distinguished artists on the organ, the piano, or in improvisation,\r\nand either came off victor or with abundant honour. On June 12, he\r\ncomposed a little Kyrie for four voices with stringed accompaniment (33\r\nK), that is precise and simple, but in style and form, and in the purity\r\nof its melody, approaches nearer to the Mozart of after life than any\r\nother composition of his boyhood.\r\n\r\nLeaving Paris on July 9 they obeyed the summons of the Prince of Condé\r\nto Dijon, where the Estates of Burgundy were assembled. Next they stayed\r\na month at Lyons, and made the acquaintance of a certain Meurikofer,\r\na merchant, who was never tired of the joke of making Wolfgang sing an\r\nItalian song with spectacles on his nose. At Ghent, where they found\r\neverything in confusion, they made no stay; at Lausanne they remained\r\nfive days at the request of several distinguished persons, especially of\r\nPrince Louis of Wurtemberg, brother of Duke Charles; they were a week\r\nat Berne, and a fortnight at Zurich; guests of the Gessner family, from\r\nwhom they received much kindness, and parted with regret. Among other\r\nbooks presented to them as keepsakes, Salomon Gessner gave them a copy\r\nof his works, with the following inscription:--\r\n\r\nAccept this gift, dear friends, in the same friendly spirit in which I\r\noffer it. May it preserve my memory fresh among you. May you, venerable\r\nparents, long enjoy the sight of the happiness of your children wherein\r\nconsists the most precious fruit of their education; may they be as\r\nhappy as their merit is extraordinary! In the tenderest youth\r\n\r\n{FIRST JOURNEY.}\r\n\r\n(48)\r\n\r\nthey are an honour to their country and the admiration of the world.\r\nHappy parents! happy children! Never forget the friend whose esteem and\r\nlove for you will never be less lively than at this moment.\r\n\r\nSalomo Gesner.\r\n\r\nZurich, August 3, 1766.\r\n\r\nTaking Winterthur and Schafhausen by the way, they journeyed to\r\nDonaueschingen, where they were expected by Prince Joseph Wenzeslaus von\r\nFürstenberg. They remained here twelve days, and played every evening\r\nfrom five to nine o'clock, always producing some novelty; they\r\nwere richly rewarded by the Prince, who was moved to tears at their\r\ndeparture. At Biberach, Count Fugger von Babenhausen arranged an organ\r\ncompetition between Wolfgang and Sixtus Bachmann, who was two years\r\nolder than Wolfgang, and had attracted great admiration by his musical\r\nperformances. \"Each tried his utmost to surpass the other, and the\r\ncompetition increased the fame of both.\"[20048] Then they went by way of\r\nUlm, Günzburg, and Dillingen to Munich. Arriving here on November 8,\r\nthey dined with the Elector on the following day. Wolfgang sat next to\r\nhim and composed a piece in pencil, taking for theme a few bars which\r\nthe Elector hummed to him; this piece he played after dinner to the\r\nastonishment of all the party.\r\n\r\nAn indisposition with which Wolfgang was here seized seems to have put\r\na stop to a journey to Regensburg which had been planned, and about the\r\nend of November, 1766, the Mozart family re-entered Salzburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2001: We have a somewhat more detailed account of this journey from\r\nletters of L. Mozart to the merchant, Lorenz Hagenauer, in whose house\r\nhe was living when Wolfgang was born (opposite the tavern \"Zu den\r\nAllürten\"). Hagenauer proved himself a true friend; always ready with\r\nsupport and counsel in business matters, even to the extent of making\r\nconsiderable loans, so that it was natural that Mozart should keep him\r\ninformed as to the pecuniary results of his journey. Many characteristic\r\ntraits are given by Schlichtegroll, probably derived from Wolfgang's\r\nsister, and confirmed after examination by Niemetschek (p. 8).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2002: Cf. L. v.

STUDY IN SALZBURG.\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD MOZART had every reason to be satisfied with the result of\r\nhis tour; the extraordinary talents of his children had been duly\r\nappreciated,[1] honours of every kind had been heaped upon them, and\r\nthe three years exertions had produced a not inconsiderable pecuniary\r\ngain.[2] In spite of repeated, and sometimes severe, attacks of illness,\r\nthe children returned to Salzburg in full health and vigour, and, what\r\nwas of not less importance, with their childlike simple minds unspoiled\r\nby the exceptional degree of notice and admiration they had everywhere\r\nexcited. The little Orpheus rode round the room on his father's stick,\r\nand sprang up to play with his favourite cat, in the middle of his\r\nimprovisations on the clavier.\r\n\r\nDuring the journey he had amused himself by constructing an imaginary\r\nkingdom, which he called Rücken; it was inhabited by children, of whom\r\nhe was king, and his invention of fresh gifts and qualities for his\r\nkingdom and subjects was inexhaustible. So vividly was it impressed\r\non his imagination, that he made a servant, who was something of a\r\ndraughtsman, draw a map of it, to which he supplied the names of the\r\nplaces.[3] A very favourite idea of his was to compose an opera, to be\r\nperformed entirely by young Salzburgers, of whom he drew up a list\r\nwith his father. His tenderness of heart was constantly displayed. One\r\nmorning on awaking, he began to cry bitterly, and\r\n\r\n{STUDY IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(50)\r\n\r\nbeing asked the reason, answered that he longed to see his friends in\r\nSalzburg, all of whom he then mentioned by name. When he heard that\r\nHagenauer's son Dominicus had entered the Monastery of St. Peter's\r\nhe burst into tears, imagining that he should never see him again.\r\nReassured on this point, he planned a visit to St. Peter's immediately\r\non his return home, and talked of the games that he and his friend would\r\nplay together.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, Wolfgang displayed a considerable amount of\r\nself-assertion. A gentleman of rank in Salzburg was uncertain how to\r\naddress the boy in conversation. The formal pronoun _Sie_ appeared\r\nunbefitting a child, while _Du_ was too familiar for so celebrated an\r\nartist; he took refuge in _Wir_, and began: \"So _we_ have been in France\r\nand England\"--\"_We_ have been introduced at court\"--\"_We_ have been\r\nhonoured\"--when Mozart interrupted him hastily: \"And yet, sir, I do not\r\nremember to have seen you anywhere but in Salzburg.\"\r\n\r\nBut L. Mozart's satisfaction was not entirely without alloy. He was\r\ntoo intimately acquainted with the Salzburg court to feel certain of\r\nobtaining such a position as would enable him to educate his children\r\nin a way befitting their talents. On this point he had written to\r\nHagenauer, shortly before their return:--\r\n\r\nEverything depends on my having a position at home which is suitable to\r\nmy children. God (all too merciful to me, miserable sinner) has endowed\r\nmy children with such genius that, laying aside my duty as a father, my\r\nambition urges me to sacrifice all else to their education. Every moment\r\nlost, is lost for ever, and if I never realised before how precious\r\nthe time of youth is, I know it now. You know that my children are\r\naccustomed to work; if they once had an excuse for idleness, such as an\r\ninconvenient house, or want of opportunity for study, my whole fabric\r\nwould fall to the ground. Custom is an iron path, and Wolfgang has still\r\nmuch to learn. But how shall we be treated in Salzburg? Perhaps we shall\r\nbe only too glad to take our knapsacks on our backs and be off again.\r\nAt any rate, I offer my children to my country. If it will have none of\r\nthem, that is not my fault, and will be my country's loss.\r\n\r\nSo shrewd a man of the world had no idea of burying the pound that might\r\nproduce such excellent interest.\r\n\r\n{INSTRUCTION IN COUNTERPOINT.}\r\n\r\n(51)\r\n\r\nThe uneventful stay of nearly a year which L. Mozart made with his\r\nchildren in Salzburg was employed in mechanical practice, and perhaps\r\nstill more in the study of composition. A detailed account of these\r\nstudies is not obtainable; but L. Mozart's wise and earnest views, his\r\nclear apprehension that genius entails twofold labour and exertion on\r\nits possessor, leave no doubt as to the severity and thoroughness of\r\nhis instruction to his son. An exercise book containing exercises\r\nin thorough-bass and counterpoint is preserved in the Mozarteum at\r\nSalzburg, bearing no date, but evidently falling within this period. The\r\nintervals and scales are followed by a long list of short lessons on a\r\ngiven melody generally in three parts, to be worked out harmonically and\r\naccording to the different kinds of simple counterpoint. (_Nota contra\r\nnotam; duoy quatuor nota contra notam; cum ligaturis; floridum_.) The\r\nchoral tunes which serve as Cantus firmus are taken from Fux's Gradus\r\nad Pamassum, which was no doubt employed as a textbook.[4] The lessons,\r\ncorrections, and brief notes are generally in the father's writing, the\r\nworking out and the fair copies of the corrected lessons are of course\r\nmade by Wolfgang; on one occasion he jokingly notes the different parts\r\nas _Il Sign. d'Alto, il Marchese Tenore, il Duca Basso_. An observation\r\nof the compositions of this period, which are still preserved, will show\r\nus the result of the studies.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Sigismund, incredulous of Wolfgang's powers, caused him, so\r\nBarrington says, to be locked up for a week, seeing no one, during which\r\ntime he was to compose an oratorio, for which the Archbishop provided\r\nthe subject. Wolfgang stood the test triumphantly, and the oratorio was\r\npublicly performed, with great success, during Lent, 1767.\r\n\r\nThis composition (35 K.) was printed in Salzburg (1767) with the\r\ntitle:--\r\n\r\n{STUDY IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(52)\r\n\r\nThe Obligation of the First and Greatest Commandment, Mark 12, v. 30:\r\nThou shalt love the Lord Thy God with all thy hearty with all thy mind,\r\nwith all thy soul, and with all thy strength.\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nAfter this preface, the declaration \"that there is no more dangerous\r\nstate for the soul than lukewarmness in the work of salvation\" is given\r\nas a reason for this musical representation \"by which it is intended not\r\nonly to delight the mind but to elevate the soul.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first part the understanding and judgment of the lukewarm\r\nChristian are stirred by the loving and indefatigable zeal of the\r\nChristian Spirit, with the assistance of Divine Mercy and Justice. In\r\nthe second part, right\r\n\r\n{FIRST ORATORIO, 1767.}\r\n\r\n(53)\r\n\r\njudgment is victorious, the will is prepared for surrender, to be\r\nfinally and completely freed from fear and wavering in the third and\r\nlast part.\r\n\r\nThe verses, richly garnished with Latin texts, have quite the prosaic\r\nbombastic character of the period.\r\n\r\nMozart's original score[6] has the title in his father's writing:\r\n\"Oratorium di Wolfgango Mozart composto nel mese di Marzo, 1766.\" As\r\nthey were then in the Netherlands, we must suspect an error. But the\r\ndate 1766 is established by the \"10 years old\" on the title-page; he\r\nmust have set to work immediately after his return, quite at the end\r\nof 1766, and the representation must have taken place in March of the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nThe score, which fills 208 pages, bears unmistakable traces of boyish\r\nworkmanship in the blotted notes, and in the uncertain writing and\r\nspelling of the text of the songs (that of the recitatives is in another\r\nand a firmer handwriting), but there is not a sign of boyishness in the\r\nmusic itself. The whole composition is modelled on the Italian oratorio,\r\nand shows a complete mastery of its forms. The introductory symphony is\r\nan allegro in the usual two parts, simple in its execution, and with no\r\nactual thematic elaboration, but precise and well rounded. The dialogue\r\nis in recitative, and maintained throughout with correct declamation,\r\nhere and there displaying a fine sense of fitting expression, which\r\ntells more for the independent power of comprehension than even\r\nthe surprising technical skill exhibited. Here and there comes an\r\naccompanied recitative, with an effort after originality, depending\r\nchiefly on the expression of the words, which are poor stuff in most\r\ncases. For instance, after the lines--\r\n\r\n     Und der Verkehrte will sich bald ergeben,\r\n     Wenn ihnen fühlbar sollte vor ihnen schweben\r\n     Das Pein-und Schreckenbild des offnen Höllengrund,\r\n\r\n{STUDY IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(54)\r\n\r\nwhich have been given in secco-recitative, comes the strongly accented\r\npassage:--\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{FIRST ORATORIO, 1767.}\r\n\r\n(55)\r\n\r\nThey are in the usual form, the principal subject elaborated and\r\nrepeated after a short intermediate subject, with ritornellos differing\r\nin length and character, according to the commonly accepted varieties.\r\nThe perfect decision of style and composition leaves the inexperienced\r\nhand of the scholar hardly visible, and it is plain that the boy has\r\ntaken in and turned to account all that he has heard. But although the\r\nwork may be considered on a level with most of the similar compositions\r\nof the time, it cannot be said to be distinguished from them by\r\nindividual character. It conforms on all important points to the Italian\r\nstyle, although there is now and then a sentimental colouring suggested\r\nby Graun's German verses.\r\n\r\nThe melodies are simple and good, with here and there a pure and\r\ndignified phrase, and a delicate expression of deep feeling. Witness\r\nthe passage in the second soprano air, \"Du wirst von deinem Leben genaue\r\nRechnung geben,\" which is afterwards well made use of in the recitative.\r\nThe very moderate embellishment of the whole work is in great measure\r\nthe father's addition. The third tenor air rises above the level of the\r\nrest; the words, although themselves certainly not inspired, have given\r\nopportunity for the expression of a tender earnest mood in a charming\r\nflowing melody whose well-chosen harmonies and admirable instrumentation\r\nshadow forth unmistakably the later Mozart. He must himself have felt\r\nthe charm of this air, for, as we shall see, he repeated it in his first\r\nopera. The finale of the oratorio is a pleasing terzet for two soprani\r\nand tenor, with the parts in easy imitation. The orchestra is the\r\nusual one of the day, stringed instruments, bassoons, seldom used\r\nindependently, two horns, and two oboes, sometimes replaced by two\r\nflutes. The parts are, as was usual, carefully put together, but without\r\nany pretence to more than technical skill; only the second tenor air has\r\nan obbligato alto trombone accompaniment suggested by a reference in the\r\ntext to the trump of doom.[7]\r\n\r\n{STUDY IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(56)\r\n\r\nA little cantata for two voices was also evidently composed for this\r\nLent. It bears the title \"Grab-Musik, 1767\" (42 K.), and is a dialogue\r\nbetween the Soul and an Angel, the verses having a decided smack of the\r\nlocal poet of Salzburg. The Soul is intrusted to a bass voice, which\r\nwas not employed in the oratorio. The cantata begins at once with a\r\nRecitative for the Soul:\r\n\r\n     Meines Jesu gottlichs Herz\r\n     Das reget sich nicht mehr,\r\n     Und ist von Blut und Leben leer.\r\n\r\n     Was für ein hartes Eisen\r\n     Konnt dieses süsseste und allerliebste\r\n     Herz zerreissen!\r\n\r\nThen follows the air--\r\n\r\n     Felsen spaltet euren Rachen, &c.\r\n\r\nHere Wolfgang has striven to express the somewhat whining pathos of the\r\ntext both by the voice and the instruments, and the result is a bravura\r\nsong, handled with great skill. There can be no doubt that this song\r\nmade a great effect at the time, though its want of good taste shocks\r\nus now. The succeeding soprano air, on the other hand, which closes with\r\nthe warning--\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{GRAB-MUSIK, 1767.}\r\n\r\n(57)\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nexpresses a soft, not unpleasing sentimental mood, which is still\r\nmore toned down in the concluding duet. Yet even here we have fanciful\r\npassages--accepted at the time as legitimate both in music and poetry,\r\nas corresponding to a complex state of feeling.\r\n\r\nFor a later performance, probably before 1775, Mozart added a final\r\nchorus, introduced by a short recitative, in unjson throughout, thus\r\nbringing the whole piece simply and melodiously to a conclusion. A\r\nlittle song (146 K.): \"Kom-met her, ihr frechen Sünder, seht den Heyland\r\naller Welt,\" not in any way remarkable, belonging probably to the\r\nbeginning of 1770, was also intended for a Lenten performance.\r\n\r\nNot long after Wolfgang's return from Paris, he paid a visit to the\r\nMonastery of Seeon, where he was on friendly terms with the monks.\r\nDuring dinner the abbot expressed his regret that no offertory had been\r\ncomposed for the festival of St. Benedict. Wolfgang took advantage of\r\nthe first pause\r\n\r\n{STUDY IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(58)\r\n\r\nto leave the dining-hall, and leaning on the ledge of the window\r\nopposite the door, he wrote his offertory \"Scande coeli limina\" (34\r\nK.). It begins with a pleasing soprano solo, a gentle flowing melody\r\naccompanied by the violins; then comes a lively chorus with drums\r\nand trumpets, somewhat cramped in style and pedantic in the imitative\r\narrangement of its parts.\r\n\r\nAmong the monks was a certain Herr v. Haasy, called Father Johannes,\r\nwho was very fond of Wolfgang. The boy sprang towards him as soon as\r\nhe entered the monastery, climbed on his neck and stroked his cheeks,\r\nsinging the while:--\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThis scene excited great amusement, and the monks were never tired of\r\nteasing him about his tune. When the fête-day of Father Johannes came\r\nround, Wolfgang presented him with an offertory (72 K.). It begins in a\r\njoyous burst with the words (Matth. xi. 11), \"Inter natos mulierum non\r\nsurrexit maior\"; then with the words \"Ioanne Baptista\" he introduces\r\nthe above melody as a birthday greeting to his friend. Apart from this\r\ncharming display of childish affection, the offertory, which in any\r\ncase belongs to his early boyhood, is a beautiful piece of music. The\r\nsubject, which is pursued throughout with a natural, easy movement of\r\nthe parts, has the caressing little melody running through it, and is\r\ntwice interrupted by the words (S. John i. v. 29), \"Ecce Agnus Dei qui\r\ntollit peccata mundi,\" given in a quiet, serious manner, that has a\r\ncharming effect. The greeting breaks out once more in the \"Alleluia,\"\r\nwhich ends the piece.[8]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1767, Wolfgang again came forward as a composer in his\r\nnative town.\r\n\r\nIt was the general custom at the university to celebrate the close of\r\nthe scholastic year by a dramatic representation\r\n\r\n{APOLLO ET HYACINTHUS.}\r\n\r\n(59)\r\n\r\namong the students. In the year 1661, a large theatre, supplied with\r\ntwelve scenes, was built to replace the smaller one hitherto used, and\r\nexcited great admiration.[9] According to custom, a Latin play, written\r\nby the Professor of Poetry, or some other ecclesiastic, was represented\r\nby the \"Benedictine Muses,\" i.e., by the students. The subject was taken\r\nfrom the Old or New Testament, more rarely from heathen mythology, and\r\nwas always intended to point some particular moral.[10] Following an old\r\nusage, musical portions were interspersed through the tragedy or comedy,\r\nas they were also in the Italian spoken drama, so that a short Latin\r\nopera of a congenial tendency, with one part serving as a prologue, was\r\nintroduced between the acts of the drama, just as in the opera seria\r\nthe intermezzi or ballets came between the acts. Members of the\r\nchapel undertook the composition, and some of the singers assisted the\r\nperformance by taking the more difficult parts.\r\n\r\nOn May 13, 1767, the Syntax, that is, the students of the second\r\nclass, performed the tragedy, \"dementia Croesi.\" This time the\r\nmusical supplement was entitled \"Apollo et Hyacinthus seu Hyacinthi\r\nMetamorphosis,\" and composed by Wolfgang, who is set forth in the\r\nprinted text-book thus: _Auctor operis musici nobilis dominus Wolfgangus\r\nMozart, un-decennis, filius nobilis ac strenui domini Leopoldi Mozart,\r\nCapello Magistri._\r\n\r\nThe old myth is treated with considerable freedom, after the manner of\r\nan Italian opera; for the edification of pious youth Melia becomes the\r\nbeloved of Apollo and Zephyrus, Hyacinthus a comparatively insignificant\r\npersonage. The piece ends _en règle_ with a betrothal. A regular\r\ndramatic treatment is not even attempted, only long detached airs and\r\nduets, old-fashioned in style and form, and adapted of necessity to\r\nthe Latin text. The dialogue is in Iambics, the choruses and songs are\r\nrhymed. The text is correct enough, but devoid of taste, and imitates in\r\nsome particulars the\r\n\r\n{STUDY IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(60)\r\n\r\nlibretti of the Italian opera. After a short overture in two parts,\r\nsimple and well put together, the action begins with a recitative\r\nbetween Hyacinthus and Zephyrus, who betrays his love for Melia and\r\njealousy of Apollo; Æbalus and Melia appear and sacrifice to Apollo,\r\nwho is invoked by the chorus:--\r\n\r\n     Numen o Latonium\r\n     Audi vota supplicum,\r\n     Qui ter digno te honore\r\n     Certant sancte colere.\r\n     Nos benigno tu favore\r\n     Subditos prosequere.\r\n\r\nThe sacrifice is not accepted; a thunderbolt scatters them all, and\r\nÆbalus tries to reassure Hyacinthus in an air:--\r\n\r\n     Sæpe terrent numina,\r\n     Surgunt et minantur,\r\n     Fingunt bella\r\n     Quae nos angunt\r\n     Mittunt tela\r\n     Quae non tangunt;\r\n     At post ficta nubila\r\n     Rident et iocantur.\r\n\r\nThen Apollo appears, and begs for the protection of Æbalus, Jupiter\r\nhaving banished him; after many civilities on either side, Apollo\r\nreturns thanks in an air. Hereupon follow the two first acts of the\r\ntragedy. Then Æbalus informs his daughter that Apollo demands her\r\nin marriage; she willingly consents, and expresses her delight in an\r\nelaborate air.\r\n\r\n     Lætari, iocari\r\n     Fruique divinis honoribus stat,\r\n     Dum hymen optimus\r\n     Tædis et floribus Grata, beata\r\n     Connubia iungit et gaudia dat?\r\n\r\nBut now comes in Zephyrus with the tidings that Hyacinthus is slain by\r\nApollo. Melia thereupon declares that she cannot accept him, OEbalus\r\nwishes to banish him, and Zephyrus expresses in an air the hopes to\r\nwhich these\r\n\r\n{APOLLO ET HYACINTH US.}\r\n\r\n(61)\r\n\r\nevents give birth. Then enters Apollo, overwhelms Zephyrus with abuse,\r\nand causes him to be borne away by the winds; Melia, enraged by this\r\nfresh deed of violence, reproaches Apollo, and a duet follows, in\r\nwhich she rejects and dismisses him, while he bewails his love and her\r\ncruelty.\r\n\r\nHereupon follow the third and fourth acts of the tragedy. Then\r\nHyacinthus is borne in dying, and declares in an accompanied recitative\r\nthat Zephyrus is his murderer, which gives occasion to Æbalus to rage\r\nduly in an air, followed by a duet between him and Melia, dreading the\r\nanger of the offended god. But Apollo appearing, changes Hyacinthus into\r\na flower, extends his forgiveness to Æbalus and Melia, and betrothes\r\nhimself to the latter.\r\n\r\nA concluding terzet expresses the general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis composition manifests throughout great decision of style, and in\r\nmany respects a very marked progress. The songs--in the old-fashioned\r\naria form--are more freely treated, the handling of the parts is more\r\nindependent, and a disposition to the imitative form is more marked than\r\nheretofore. In the duet between Melia and Æbalus, for instance, and in\r\nthe first chorus, where the voices are treated harmonically, the violins\r\nhave an imitative phrase in the accompaniment.\r\n\r\nMistakes here and there in the text prove Wolfgang's Latin to be still\r\nthat of a learner. A droll little note written in 1769, to Madame\r\nHagenauer, shows that he was then working hard at it. The note runs as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nDear Friend,--I hope you will excuse the liberty I take in troubling\r\nyou with these few lines; but since you told me yesterday that you\r\nunderstood everything, and that I might write Latin to you as much as I\r\nchose, I cannot refrain from sending you at once some Latin lines, and\r\nwhen you have read them please send the answer back by one of your own\r\nservants, for our girl cannot wait. (But you must send me the answer in\r\na letter.)\r\n\r\nCuperem scire, de qua causa, à quam plurimis adolescentibus ottium usque\r\nadeo æstimetur, ut ipsi se nec verbis, nec verberibus, ab hoc sinant\r\nabduci.\r\n\r\nEven if the text were translated and explained to him, it would have\r\nbeen strange if he had found no difficulty in the\r\n\r\n{STUDY IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(62)\r\n\r\nlanguage; and it is only another proof of the boy's musical apprehension\r\nthat his setting of the familiar German sacred texts has a more\r\ndistinctive character than that of this piece of declamatory school\r\nrhetoric; the mere fact of being set to produce a brilliant work as\r\na task had its influence on the music, which is cold and stiff, and\r\nsometimes devoid of taste. No doubt the long passages, the peculiar\r\nturns given to the pompous or amorous melodies, all that appears to us\r\nmost tiresome was then most loudly applauded, and the truly surprising\r\nability shown in the working out may have passed at that time for\r\noriginal productive power, which is just what we cannot grant it to have\r\nbeen. Still, there are not wanting signs even of this, and the young\r\nartist asserts his individuality at once whenever he has to express a\r\nsimple emotion, such as he can comprehend and enter into.\r\n\r\nThere is a little solo in the first chorus (G major, 3-4) which, in its\r\nexpressive simplicity, almost reminds us of Gluck. Again, in the duet\r\nbetween Melia and Obalus there is a long well-worked-out cantilene,\r\nwhich is not without beauty and expression, and is further distinguished\r\nby original instrumentation. In this the first violins (muted) lead the\r\nmelody, the second violins and bass accompany _pizzicato_, two tenors\r\n_coll' arco_, and two horns are introduced; a very striking variation on\r\nthe otherwise simple orchestral accompaniment, consisting of the string\r\nquartet, two oboes, and two horns.\r\n\r\nThe duet between Melia and Apollo shows most dramatic talent, being the\r\nonly expression of an exciting situation and contrasting emotions. The\r\nrecitatives are not distinguished by characteristic expression in the\r\nsame degree as those of the sacred pieces; they are easy and flowing,\r\nbut quite in the style of the ordinary recitative of Italian opera; no\r\ndoubt because Mozart felt that such an expression of feeling as suited\r\nthe elevated, lyrical emotions of the cantata was unsuited to the\r\ndialogue of an opera.\r\n\r\nIt is an astonishing proof of the productiveness and constant industry\r\nof the young composer that, between December and May, three important\r\nworks were completed and performed. In the summer of 1767 we find him\r\npreparing\r\n\r\n{VIENNA, 1767.}\r\n\r\n(63)\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nfor a journey to Vienna, and composing four clavier concertos (37,39-41\r\nK.), in F (April), B flat ( June), D and G major ( July), with the usual\r\norchestral accompaniment; once, only, trumpets are added. The form is\r\nthe usual one in three movements, like the symphony. The compositions\r\nare not above the ordinary level, and have little either of original\r\nor technical interest. It is noteworthy that even in these works, which\r\nwere to serve as show pieces, we can trace no signs of boyish pleasure\r\nin odd or artificial effects; the love of tuneful melody, and the\r\nendeavour to blend the orchestra and the solo part into an harmonious\r\nwhole, are as observable in his first compositions as in his last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A marvellous account is given in the Historisch moralischen\r\nBelustigungen des Geistes (Hamb., 1765), Stüclc VII.

THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.\r\n\r\nTHE approaching marriage of the Archduchess Maria Josepha with King\r\nFerdinand of Naples furnished Leopold Mozart with a pretext for\r\nrepairing to Vienna with his whole family; this he did in the beginning\r\nof September,\r\n\r\n1767, with every expectation that the public of that brilliant capital\r\nwould recognise the progress made by Wolfgang since their former\r\nvisit.[1]\r\n\r\nThey travelled quickly; were invited to dine with the Bishop at Lambach;\r\nand at the Monastery of Mölk, where Wolfgang tried the organ, his\r\nplaying was at once recognised by the organist.\r\n\r\nMisfortune awaited them at Vienna. The charming and universally beloved\r\nPrincess Josepha fell ill of the small-pox, which carried her off in\r\nless than a month. This, of course, put a stop to any appearance at\r\ncourt, or at the houses of the nobility.\r\n\r\nLeopold Mozart had been advised when in Paris to follow the example of\r\nthe Duke of Orleans, who had set the fashion\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(64)\r\n\r\nof inoculation with his own children in 1756, and to \"graft the\r\nsmall-pox\" in his little boy. \"But I prefer,\" he wrote (February 22,\r\n1764), \"to leave it all in God's hands; let Him, in His divine mercy,\r\ndispose as He will of the life of this wonder of nature.\" Now, however,\r\nhe took instant flight to Olmütz with his children, but they did not\r\nescape; first Wolfgang sickened, then Marianne. Count Leopold Anton von\r\nPodstatzky, Dean of Olmütz and Canon of Salzburg (which would account\r\nfor his acquaintance with Mozart), out of compassion to the distracted\r\nfather, took the whole family into his house, making light of the risk\r\nof infection. In the deanery, well cared for, and skilfully doctored,\r\nthe children passed through all stages of the disease, which, with\r\nWolfgang at least, was so severe, that he lay blind for nine days.\r\n\r\n\"Again is the saying proved true,\" writes L. Mozart: \"In Te Domine\r\nsperavi, non confundar in æternum.\" \"What extraordinary and unexpected\r\ngood fortune it was that Count P. should have been willing to receive\r\na child with the small-pox! I cannot tell you with what kindness and\r\ngoodness we were treated; who else would have received a family under\r\nsuch circumstances, and that from an impulse of pure humanity? This good\r\ndeed shall redound to the honour of the Count in the biography of our\r\nlittle one which I intend to publish some day, for I consider that it is\r\nthe commencement of a new epoch in his life.\"\r\n\r\nHe endeavoured also to bring about an expression \"of gratitude, or at\r\nall events of approbation\" on the part of the Archbishop towards the\r\nCount. For several weeks after his recovery, Wolfgang was obliged to\r\nbe very careful of his eyes, and his daily visitor, the Archbishop's\r\nchaplain, Hay, afterwards Bishop of Konigsgràz (brother to Frau von\r\nSonnenfels),[2] strove to relieve the tedium of his enforced idleness by\r\nteaching him card-games, in which the boy soon became as great an adept\r\nas his instructor. He threw himself with the same zeal into the practice\r\nof fencing,\r\n\r\n{IMPERIAL CONDESCENSION--VIENNA, 1768.}\r\n\r\n(65)\r\n\r\nhaving at all times a great love of exercises demanding bodily\r\nactivity.[3] When his recovery was complete, he composed an aria for the\r\nlittle daughter of his physician, Wolf, of which her father reminded him\r\nin later years (May 28, 1778).\r\n\r\nOn their return journey to Vienna they stayed for a fortnight at Brunn,\r\nwhere they were received with great kindness by Count Franz Anton\r\nSchrattenbach, brother to Archbishop Sigismund, of Salzburg: all the\r\nnobility residing at Brünn treated them with the \"highest distinction.\"\r\n\r\nBut at Vienna, which they re-entered at the beginning of January, 1768,\r\ndifficulties crowded thick upon them. At court, indeed, their reception\r\ntook place sooner than they had dared to hope. The Empress Maria Theresa\r\nhad scarcely recovered from the small-pox, when she remembered her\r\nadmiration of the children, and sent for the family.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor himself came into the ante-chamber, and conducted them\r\nto his mother, no other person being present but Duke Albert of\r\nSachsen-Teschen, and the Archduchesses. They passed two hours in the\r\nmidst of this family circle. The Empress, a motherly woman, conversed\r\nintimately with Frau Mozart, and questioned her on all details of\r\nthe children's illness, pressing her hands and stroking her cheeks\r\ncompassionately, while the Emperor discussed musical and other matters\r\nwith Wolfgang and his father, and \"made Nannerl blush very often.\"\r\n\r\nThis unusual condescension was gratifying to the patriotic feelings\r\nof the Mozart family, but it was not directly profitable. The Empress\r\npresented them with a pretty medal of small value; but as she had\r\nvisited neither the opera nor the theatre since the death of her\r\nconsort, and had discontinued all musical parties, a summons to play\r\nat court could only come from the Emperor. But Joseph showed little\r\ninclination to liberality in the cause of art, and others, besides L.\r\nMozart, complained of his parsimony.\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(66)\r\n\r\nThe nobility followed the example of the court, and avoided any\r\nappearance of extravagance in order to ingratiate themselves with\r\nthe Emperor. Dancing was the only amusement during the carnival,\r\nbut, whereas, formerly the nobles vied with each other in costly\r\nentertainments, at which distinguished artists were nearly always\r\npresent, they now gave their balls in public rooms and at small\r\nexpense. L. Mozart suspects that the court made its advantage by this,\r\ncontracting for all dances, masquerades, and balls, and sharing the\r\nprofits with the contractor. Under these circumstances, the good\r\nrecommendations Mozart had brought with him were of little use. He had\r\nletters to the Master of the Horse, Count von Dietrichstein, who was\r\nhigh in the Emperor's favour, to Fräulein Josepha Guttenberg, \"the\r\nEmpress's right hand,\" and to the court physician, L'Augier,[4] a\r\ntravelled and accomplished man of considerable talent, and excellent\r\njudgment in music; all that was refined and cultivated in Viennese\r\nsociety flocked to his assemblies. Among Mozart's patrons was also Duke\r\nJoh. Carl v. Braganza, a man of the first importance, who had proved his\r\nspirit and courage at the earthquake of Lisbon, and as a volunteer in\r\nthe Austrian army;[5] frequent travels had increased his knowledge and\r\nenlarged his views;[6] he was an excellent companion and a thorough\r\nmusical connoisseur.[7]\r\n\r\nGluck dedicated to him his \"Paride ed Elena\" (1770), and in the\r\nwell-known dedication explained that he sought in the Duke, not so much\r\na patron as a judge, of thorough knowledge, fine taste, and unprejudiced\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nThe Mozarts were further favourably noticed by Prince Kaunitz, an\r\nelegant connoisseur, but a man of such exaggerated anxiety on the\r\nsubject of his health, that he would not admit Wolfgang into his\r\npresence as long as the traces of the small-pox remained on his face.\r\n\r\n{MUSIC IN VIENNA, 1768.}\r\n\r\n(67)\r\n\r\nBut the Viennese generally were not enthusiastic for art. Leopold Mozart\r\ngives the following account of them:--\r\n\r\nThe Viennese public, as a whole, has no love of anything serious or\r\nsensible; they cannot even understand it; and their theatres furnish\r\nabundant proof that nothing but utter trash, such as dances, burlesques,\r\nharlequinades, ghost tricks, and devil's antics will go down with them.\r\nYou may see a fine gentleman, even with an order on his breast, laughing\r\ntill the tears run down his face, and applauding with all his might some\r\npiece of senseless buffoonery; whilst in a most affecting scene, where\r\nthe situation and action are alike irresistibly fine and pathetic, and\r\nwhere the dialogue is of the highest order, he will chatter so loud with\r\na lady that his better-informed neighbours can scarcely hear a word of\r\nthe play.\r\n\r\nRecollecting the efforts that were being made just at this time\r\nby Sonnenfels and his colleagues to introduce a higher style\r\nof entertainment in Vienna,[8] this description will not appear\r\nexaggerated. Indeed, L. Mozart fails to animadvert on the main\r\nentertainment of the Viennese, the barbarous baiting of wild animals.\r\nUnder these circumstances, it is conceivable that the same people who\r\nraved about the performances of the little prodigy, felt little interest\r\nin the development of an artist's genius. To this passive indifference\r\non the part of the public was added the active opposition of envious\r\nmusicians living by their profession, who had been ready to applaud the\r\nprecocity of a child, but who saw with quite other eyes the arrival in\r\ntheir midst of an accomplished musician ready to meet them on their own\r\nground.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart says of them:--\r\n\r\nI soon found that all the clavier-players and composers in Vienna were\r\nin opposition to us, Wagenseil only excepted, who, being ill, could be\r\nof little use to us. The plan adopted by these people was to avoid\r\nall opportunities of seeing us or of learning the extent of Wolfgang's\r\nattainments. Why was this? In order that when they were asked whether\r\nthey had heard the boy, and what they thought of him, they might reply\r\nin the negative, and deny the possibility of what they were told; that\r\nthey might assert his performances to be impostures and\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(68)\r\n\r\nmere buffoonery, got up beforehand, and all that he pretended to compose\r\nto have been previously learnt. Now you see why they avoided us. They\r\nknew very well that if they saw and heard they would not have a word to\r\nsay without the risk of losing their honour. But I set a trap for one\r\nof these good folks. I persuaded some one to give me quiet notice of\r\nhis presence, and to induce him to bring an extraordinarily difficult\r\nconcerto, which was to be laid before Wolfgang. This all took place, and\r\nhe had the satisfaction of hearing his concerto played by Wolfgang as\r\nif he knew it by heart. The astonishment of this composer and\r\nclavier-player, the expressions of which he made use in his admiration,\r\nlet us all into the secret of what I have told you above. He ended\r\nby saying: \"I must honestly declare my opinion that this boy is the\r\ngreatest musician in the world; I could not have believed it.\"\r\n\r\nBut a solitary triumph of this sort could not do much against the secret\r\nenmity of an envious cabal. The Emperor himself furnished a better\r\nweapon by a proposal which was calculated to display Wolfgang's powers\r\nin the most brilliant light. He ordered him to compose an opera, and\r\nintimated a wish that the boy should himself conduct the work at the\r\nclavier.\r\n\r\nBoth father and son eagerly seized on this proposal, the more so as\r\nsuccess would not only insure their position in Vienna, but would pave\r\nthe way for the young artist to Italy and the Italian stage.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor announced his wish to the theatrical manager, Affligio.\r\nLeopold Mozart, knowing that the fate of an opera greatly depends on the\r\nperformers, strove to win the goodwill of the artists, male and female;\r\nthis was not difficult to accomplish, for it was felt that unusual\r\napplause would be given to the work of so young an artist, and Affligio\r\nwas urged on all sides to undertake the production of the work. He was\r\nready enough to consent; and concluded a contract to produce the opera,\r\nwith an honorarium to the composer of 100 ducats.\r\n\r\nThe singers available for opera seria were not by any means of the first\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nOn September 29, 1767, L. Mozart gives as his opinion that Hasse's\r\nopera (\"Partenope\") is fine, but the singers, considering the occasion,\r\nindifferent; Tibaldi was the tenor; Rauzzini, of Munich, the best male\r\nsoprano; the\r\n\r\n{GLUCK'S \"ALCESTE.\"}\r\n\r\n(69)\r\n\r\nprima donna was Elizabeth Deiberin (Teyber), daughter of a Viennese\r\ncourt violinist, and pupil of Tesi and Hasse. Gluck had not been willing\r\nto entrust his \"Alceste\" to these singers. \"Alceste\" was brought out\r\nin Vienna on December 16, 1767; Bemasconi made a great sensation as\r\nAlceste, but Tibaldi took Admetus. The Mozarts were then at Olmtitz, but\r\nthey had an opportunity on their return of hearing what L. Mozart calls\r\n\"Gluck's melancholy 'Alceste.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable coincidence, that in the act of writing his first\r\nopera, Wolfgang should have witnessed in Gluck's \"Alceste\" the most\r\nmarked attempt yet made for the reform of dramatic music; and it is not\r\nunlikely that early association may have been partly the cause that he\r\nafterwards studied \"Alceste\" with unquestionable partiality.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart's ideas were too firmly rooted in the tradition of Italian\r\nmusic to enable him to appreciate Gluck's innovations. That the public\r\nin general were of his opinion is evident from Sonnenfels' mimicry of\r\nthe gossip, not of the gallery, but of the boxes of the nobility:--\r\n\r\n\"This is edifying! Nine days without a play, and on the tenth we get a\r\nDe profundis--What? This is meant to be pathetic? Well, perhaps we shall\r\nshed a few tears presently--from _ennui_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, this is throwing money away! It is too absurd, a fool of a woman\r\ndying for her husband!\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the Opera Buffa, on the contrary, were of first-rate\r\nexcellence;[9] the die was cast, therefore, for an opera buffa. The text\r\nwas furnished by Marco Coltellini, who had been \"Theatrical Poet\" in\r\nVienna since 1764, and in 1772 was made \"Imperial Poet\" at the court\r\nof St. Petersburg. He wrote after the manner of Metastasio, who\r\ncomplimented him highly;[10] his principal libretti were for Gassmaun\r\n(\"Amore\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(70)\r\n\r\nPsiche\"), Hasse (\"Piramo Tisbe\"), Salieri (\"Armida\"),[11] and for\r\nMozart \"La Finta Semplice,\" in three Acts (51 K). Wolfgang set to work\r\nat once in order that the opera might be ready by Easter. As soon as\r\nthe first act was completed it was distributed among the singers, who\r\nexpressed their entire satisfaction and admiration. But delay was caused\r\nby the poet, who proceeded so leisurely with the alterations in the text\r\nrequired both by composer and performers, that he had not finished\r\nthem until after Easter. Mozart, nothing daunted, composed eagerly and\r\nindustriously, wrote new airs whenever they were demanded, and had soon\r\ncompleted the score of 25 numbers and 558 pages, in three parts. In\r\nthe meantime intrigues were set on foot from all sides to hinder the\r\nproduction of the opera. Advantage was taken of a natural feeling of\r\nrepugnance at seeing a boy of twelve years old conducting in the place\r\nusually occupied by Gluck. Leopold suspected Gluck of being concerned\r\nin these intrigues. It is true he wrote at first: \"I have brought Gluck\r\nover to our side, and even if he is not quite sincere, he has to keep it\r\nto himself, for his patrons are also ours;\" but later he says, in plain\r\nlanguage: \"So far, all the composers, with Gluck as their leader,\r\nhave left no stone unturned to hinder the progress of this opera.\" The\r\ndecision with which Gluck proceeded on the path he had marked out for\r\nhimself may have caused him to take less interest in Mozart's youthful\r\ngenius than seemed to the father right, and the latter may have been\r\nstill further repelled by Gluck's unsociable manners;[12] but envy and\r\nintrigue directed against struggling talent are inconsistent with the\r\ncomposer's proud and upright character. Nevertheless, the music was\r\ncondemned beforehand as being \"not worth a groat, suiting neither the\r\nwords nor the metre, in consequence of the boy's not understanding\r\nItalian sufficiently well.\" Thereupon Leopold caused Hasse, a man\r\nhonoured for his reputation, beloved for his gentle disposition, and\r\njustly called the \"father of music,\"[13] and Metastasio, as the\r\n\r\n{PROFESSIONAL INTRIGUES.}\r\n\r\n(71)\r\n\r\nhighest authority, to pronounce their opinion in opposition to Gluck and\r\nCalsabigi,[14] that of thirty operas produced in Vienna Wolfgang's was\r\nincomparably the best, and worthy of the highest admiration.\r\n\r\nThen the mode of attack was changed. The composition, it was said, was\r\nnot Wolfgang's at all, but his father's. This assertion also could be\r\ndisproved. At a large assembly, where there were present Prince\r\nKaunitz, Duke of Braganza, Bono, Kapellmeister to the Prince von\r\nHildburghausen,[15] Metastasio, and Hasse, a favourite volume of\r\nMetastasio was opened, and a song taken at random was given to Mozart to\r\ncompose and write down with orchestral accompaniments--a proof which\r\nat least left no doubt of the boy's technical skill and readiness.\r\nNiemetschek confirms this through the testimony of \"credible persons,\"\r\nwho had been present at similar tests.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all L. Mozart's exertions the unceasing slanders issuing\r\nfrom \"the stirred-up hell of music\" reached at last the artists who\r\nwere to represent the opera. The orchestra were encouraged to resent the\r\nleadership of a boy; the singers, although they had one and all declared\r\nthemselves fully satisfied with the music, now that they saw the\r\nstrength of the opposition, began to fear the effect of the opera before\r\nthe public. It became their interest to postpone its production, and\r\nto shrug their shoulders over the composition whenever they saw an\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart complains bitterly of the duplicity of the singers, some of\r\nwhom scarcely knew their notes, and had to learn everything by ear,\r\nand assures Count Zeil, who thought that all the musicians were in\r\nWolfgang's favour, that he must not judge from the outside, but must\r\nlearn the \"innate malice of the creatures.\"\r\n\r\nSoon the impresario, who had undertaken the production of the opera\r\nchiefly on account of the effect likely to be produced by the boyish age\r\nof the composer, began to reflect on\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(72)\r\n\r\nthe risk he was running, and to draw back. Affügio was an adventurer and\r\na gambler, who had procured an officer's commission by swindling, and\r\nhad risen to be lieutenant-colonel; his utter want of sympathy with art\r\nwas illustrated by the anecdote that being present at a bull-baiting\r\nwhere two dogs were pitted against a Hungarian ox, he remarked to a\r\nfriend, \"Believe me, I prefer these dogs to Aufrene and Neuville\" (two\r\nexcellent actors, then high in favour with him).[16] His name acquired\r\nan unhappy immortality by the share which he took more than once in the\r\nstruggle of the legitimate drama against the buffoonery of the age.[17]\r\nHe was at last sent to the galleys for forgery, and there ended his\r\ncareer.[18]\r\n\r\nWith such a man as this had Mozart to do. He postponed the opera on\r\nevery possible pretext from Easter to Whitsuntide, then to the Emperor's\r\nreturn from Hungary, and so on continually, putting one opera after the\r\nother into rehearsal, and as often as L. Mozart wrung from him the\r\norder to copy and rehearse Wolfgang's opera, so often was it secretly\r\nrecalled. The Emperor's interest in the work remained unabated, and\r\nhe frequently inquired after its progress from Wolfgang; but even his\r\ninfluence could not prevail against Affligio, who held his position\r\nquite independent of the court. He had the theatre on a lease, and\r\nbore all the expenses, the imperial family having the privilege of free\r\ningress.\r\n\r\nAffligio had promised the nobles, and especially Prince Kaunitz, to\r\nrevive the French drama, discarded in 1766. He accomplished this in\r\n1768, but, according to L. Mozart, at a cost of 70,000 gulden and a\r\ngreat loss to himself; Prince Kaunitz strove to make the loss good by an\r\nappeal to the Emperor to share in the expenses; but this attempt failed\r\nsignally. Under these circumstances, no influence from this quarter\r\ncould be brought to bear on Affligio, and nothing remained for L. Mozart\r\nbut to overcome his evasions step by step. When at last Affligio was\r\ndriven to bay he declared\r\n\r\n{TREACHERY OF AFFLIGIO--FAILURE.}\r\n\r\n(73)\r\n\r\nthat he would give the opera if L. Mozart insisted on it, but that it\r\nshould not benefit him much, for he would take care that it was hissed\r\noff the stage. After this threat, which would certainly have been\r\nfulfilled, nothing remained but to give up the production of the opera.\r\nOn September 21, L. Mozart justified himself to the Emperor by a formal\r\ncomplaint against Affligio, which was intrusted for delivery to the\r\nCourt Director of Music (Hof und Kammer-Musik-director), Count Joh.\r\nWenzel Spork, a zealous musical friend; but, as might have been\r\nforeseen, it was without result.\r\n\r\nFor nine months the affair had thus dragged on, during which time L.\r\nMozart had been living with his family at Vienna almost entirely on the\r\nproceeds of their previous tour. His receipts at Vienna could not but be\r\ninsignificant, and the salary which he drew at Salzburg as professor\r\nof the violin in the Royal Chapel, and leader of the orchestra, was\r\nwithdrawn in March of this year with the observation that he might\r\nremain away as long as he chose, but that he would not be paid during\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\nHe was too proud to use the influence of his patron, Count\r\nSchrattenbach, brother to the Archbishop, in soliciting the continuance\r\nof a salary which, \"in the firm opinion of most of the court officials,\"\r\nhe did not deserve.\r\n\r\nBut he could no longer count with certainty on the future security of\r\nhis position at Salzburg, and a rumour even reached him that this\r\nwas imperilled by the gossip which represented his gains in Vienna as\r\nenormous, and fixed on 2,000 gulden as the sum which had been paid for\r\nWolfgang's opera.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart sought to justify himself with the Archbishop by a reference\r\nto Affligio's want of faith, which it had been impossible to foresee;\r\nand by declaring that had the work been an opera seria instead of an\r\nopera buffa, requiring all the strength of the Viennese company, he\r\nwould not have hesitated to shake the dust of Vienna from his feet, and\r\nlay his son's first important composition at the feet of his rightful\r\nand gracious lord. The honour of the Archbishop himself Mozart\r\nconsidered to be concerned, that artists employed\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(74)\r\n\r\nand recommended by him should not be treated as \"charlatans, liars, and\r\nimpostors, who go abroad with his permission to throw dust in people's\r\neyes like common conjurors\"; and the Archbishop was implored to\r\nundertake Wolfgang's cause as identical with his own against people,\r\nwho \"because they sniff the air of the town where the Emperor happens to\r\nreside, look with disdain on those who serve foreign princes, and speak\r\ndisrespectfully of the foreign princes themselves.\"\r\n\r\nNay, he calls upon him as a Christian to convince the unbelievers\r\nthat the Almighty has worked a miracle in the birth of this prodigy at\r\nSalzburg:--\r\n\r\nIf ever I considered it my duty to convince the world of this miracle\r\nI do so now, at a time when every effort is made to bring miracles into\r\ndisrepute and ridicule. What greater joy and triumph could I enjoy than\r\nto hear the astonished exclamation of a follower of Voltaire (Grimm):\r\n_Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle; it is the first._ But\r\nbecause this marvel is too patent and too open to be denied, every\r\neffort is made to suppress it, and to deprive the Lord of the glory due\r\nto Him. There is an idea that in a few years the wonder will cease and\r\nwill fall back into the natural. So it is to be hidden away from the\r\neyes of the world; for what could manifest it more openly than a public\r\nperformance in a large and populous city?\r\n\r\nThis tone was undoubtedly adopted as an appeal to the Archbishop's\r\nbigoted piety.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all discouragements, L. Mozart never swerved from his main\r\nobject. He had an immovable faith in the Providence which had \"so often\r\nand so evidently urged him on or held him back, and always led him in\r\nthe right way.\" Just as firm was his confidence in the artistic gifts\r\nof his son, for whose glorious future he considered it his mission to\r\nprepare the way. His conviction that the opera in Vienna would be the\r\npioneer on the road to Italy made him ready to sacrifice to it even his\r\nofficial position in Salzburg:--\r\n\r\nI reckon upon this as a means of extorting permission for the journey to\r\nItaly, a journey which, all things considered, cannot be long delayed,\r\nand for which the Emperor himself has given me every possible assistance\r\nin the imperial towns, and in Florence and Naples. Failing\r\n\r\n{FORTITUDE OF L. MOZART.}\r\n\r\n(75)\r\n\r\nthis, we must pine at Salzburg in the vain hope of better fortune,\r\nuntil I shall have grown too old to make the journey at all, and until\r\nWolfgang has grown up, and his performances are deprived of everything\r\nmarvellous. Can it be that the first step of this opera in Vienna shall\r\nhave been made in vain, and that my son is not to advance with rapid\r\nstrides along the path so plainly marked out for him?\r\n\r\nHowever bitterly he felt that ill-will and disappointment pursued him\r\nin Vienna as they had never done abroad, and that his opponents were\r\nGermans seeking to oppress a German, whom foreigners had treated with\r\njustice and liberality, yet intrigues and slanders never deprived him of\r\npatience and self-command:--\r\n\r\nIt is just the way of the world; if a man has no talent he is unhappy\r\nenough, but if he has talent, then envy follows him in proportion to his\r\nability. All we can do is by patience and perseverance to convince the\r\nworld that our adversaries are malicious liars, slanderers, and covetous\r\nwretches, who would laugh in their sleeve if we allowed them to frighten\r\nor weary us.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to withhold our sympathy from L. Mozart's shrewd and\r\npatient endeavours to bring to light his son's work, in the full\r\nbelief of its worth; but we must ascertain also how far this belief\r\nis justified by the work itself. The opera is preserved in Mozart's\r\nhandwriting, and a detailed examination of it serves to confirm the\r\njudgment of contemporary critics, that it is not only on a level with\r\nthe numerous comic operas of the time, but far superior to the majority\r\nof them.[19]\r\n\r\nThe text goes far to justify Coltellini's want of success as a\r\nlibrettist. The poverty of the plot, the unreality of the characters,\r\nand the stupidity of the jokes, all prove the truth of Nicolai's severe\r\ncriticism of the \"outlandish musical zany in Vienna, whose pieces are as\r\npoor as those of any mountebank.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThe plot is somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(76)\r\n\r\nFracasso, a Hungarian officer, is quartered with his servant Simone\r\nin the house of two rich bachelors, Cassandro and Polidoro, who have a\r\nbeautiful sister Giacinta. Fracasso and Simone are of course carrying\r\non a love intrigue with Giacinta and her maid, Ninetta, of which the\r\nbrothers know nothing. The latter are broad caricatures. Polidoro, the\r\nyounger of the two, is simple and timid, but amorous by nature, which\r\nhe does not dare to betray to Cassandro, who, by virtue of his wealth,\r\ntalent, and good looks, of which he is inordinately vain, tyrannises\r\nover his household, and though not less amorous than his brother, feigns\r\na contempt for women. In order to outwit the brothers and force them\r\ninto a consent to their union, the two pair of lovers plot that Rosine,\r\nFracasso's sister, who is expected on a visit, shall, under Ninetta's\r\ninstruction, make both brothers in love with her. Rosine enters with\r\n'feigned simplicity,' and with a marvellous show of _naïveté_ throws\r\nherself at the head of the two brothers. Each of them, delighted at her\r\ndemonstration of love, wishes to marry her at once. The tricks which she\r\nplays on them, the Complications which ensue when each brother in turn\r\nsurprises her with the other, their attempts to ingratiate themselves\r\nwith her, and their awkward manners form the main subject of the opera,\r\nwhich is devoid of dramatic action, and consists of detached burlesque\r\nscenes. We will note a few characteristic traits. At their first\r\nmeeting, after a very few words, Polidoro proposes marriage on the spot\r\nto Rosine. She shows herself not averse but _\"domanda un matrimonio i\r\npassi suoi, s' am a da prima, e poiche qualche visita almeno, qualche\r\ngentil biglietto, qualche bel regalo.\"_ He is nothing daunted; as for\r\nlove he declares, it exists already; for the visits, he has just paid\r\none. Ninetta shall write a love-letter for him, and, by way of present,\r\nhe thrusts a purse of gold into her hand. In a subsequent scene he is\r\nformally instructed in the duties of a husband.\r\n\r\nCassandro fares no better. At their first interview, Rosine begs for a\r\nring which he wears, and, on his refusal, she teases him into lending\r\nit, whereupon he plainly expresses his doubt of ever receiving it back\r\nagain. In the following act he comes in intoxicated and is consequently\r\nforced by Rosine to converse with her from the opposite corner of the\r\nstage; she expresses herself in pantomine, which he misunderstands, and\r\nat last goes to sleep. Then she puts the ring on his finger again and\r\nleaves him.\r\n\r\nFracasso enters, and Cassandro complains that his sister has kept the\r\nring; but as it is shown to be on his finger, a duel is the consequence,\r\nin which Cassandro makes full display of his cowardice. To bring matters\r\nto a point the brothers are informed that Giacinta and Ninetta have\r\ndecamped with gold and jewels, and are induced to promise the hands\r\nof these young ladies to whomsoever shall bring them back. Fracasso and\r\nSimone are happy enough to accomplish this; Rosine having given her hand\r\nto Cassandro, clears up all misunderstandings, and the piece ends amid\r\ngeneral rejoicings.\r\n\r\n{LA FINTA SEMPLICE.}\r\n\r\n(77)\r\n\r\nThe noble and refined genius of young Mozart now, as ever, raising to a\r\nhigher sphere all with which it came in contact, was able to transform\r\nand quicken even such miserable trash as this. The jesting is confined\r\nto the dialogue; the songs have a higher tone, and in the finales, which\r\nare unquestionably burlesque in their situations, the poor fun of the\r\ntext is made subordinate to the strongly marked individuality of the\r\ncomposer. A talent for musical delineation of character is clearly\r\nvisible in this work, and must be entirely ascribed to the genius of the\r\nyouthful composer, who had no help from the poet. The part of Polidoro\r\nis the most favourable instance of dramatic power. It was written for\r\nCaribaldi, whose beautiful voice was very telling in slow movements, but\r\nwho had a poor execution, and strove unsuccessfully to imitate Caratoli\r\nin his acting.[21] Mozart has contrived to give a simple, noble\r\nexpression to the genuine feeling of love which invests even the poor\r\nsimple dupe with a certain dignity; and yet the comic element is never\r\nlost sight of. His first air (7), in which he describes the impression\r\nmade on him by Rosine, is the crown of the whole opera. The naïve\r\nemotion of a youth, who is as yet unconscious of the strength of his own\r\npassions, is so naturally and heartily expressed, that we may well ask\r\nhow the boy had acquired such a degree of psychological insight. We are\r\nreminded of Cherubino in \"Figaro,\" but Polidoro is not to be compared\r\nto the Page in fire and spirit. All Mozart's later characteristics,\r\nthe quiet beauty and easy flow of the melodies and harmonies, the\r\nsymmetrical blending of the details into a whole, and the intrinsic\r\nunity of style, are already to be traced, and we may fairly rank this\r\nsong with those of his maturer works.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation is carefully and effectively worked out. The first\r\nviolins and the voice go together, the second violins have a simple\r\naccompaniment, the basses\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(78)\r\n\r\nplay _pizzicato_. Two tenors and bassoons, generally in unison, supply\r\nthe shadows to this outline (as it may fairly be termed), and two oboes\r\nlet in the appropriate lights; the horns, made use of only in long-drawn\r\nnotes, keep the whole together. The skilful employment of these simple\r\nmeans produces an effect of light and shade which is at once striking\r\nand beautiful.\r\n\r\nAs we have already observed, this air was taken, with slight\r\nmodifications, and with the omission of the middle movement in G minor,\r\nand of the Da capo, from Mozart's earlier oratorio (p. 55). This species\r\nof borrowing was common enough at the time, but Mozart never made use of\r\nit except in this instance; his having done so here proves how strongly\r\nthe young composer himself felt the beauty of his music.\r\n\r\nPolidoro's air in the second act (17) has far more of dramatic energy.\r\nRosine, insulted by Cassandro, bursts into tears; Polidoro, indignant\r\nwith his brother, but more than half-frightened at his own temerity,\r\nseeks to console her. The contrast between his strong feeling of\r\nattraction to Rosine and the effort which he makes to overcome his fear\r\nof his brother is well marked by modulations of time and measure, and by\r\nthe instrumentation; the accelerated part has much of the ordinary buffo\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nNext to Polidoro we may rank Rosine. The part was publicly announced for\r\nClementine Baglioni, whose voice \"had a silvery tone, was as easy and\r\nfluent as could be desired, and carried admirably\"; she sang \"without\r\naudacity and correctly; her gestures were easy and becoming.\"[22] \"The\r\nsame simplicity and truthfulness of expression is observable here as\r\nin the part of Polidoro. The first song (6) in which she undertakes to\r\nshow--\r\n\r\n     Che si puö senza rossore\r\n\r\nGradir tutti ed un solo amar, is fresh and lively, and the passages are\r\nso natural and graceful, that even in the present day it does not sound\r\n\r\n{ROSINE, CASSANDRO.}\r\n\r\n(79)\r\n\r\nantiquated. The first part of the second song (9) is especially\r\nbeautiful, and the principal melody reminds us, in dignity and\r\nexpression, of the Countess in \"Figaro.\" The words--\r\n\r\n     Senti I' eco, ove t' aggiri,\r\n     Susurrar tra fiori e fronde\r\n     Ma se gridi, o se sospiri\r\n     Quello sol 1' eco risponde,\r\n     Che ti sente à ragionar.\r\n\r\ngive opportunity for descriptive music, the _susurrar_ being expressed\r\nby a phrase for the violins, while a solo oboe enacts the part of Echo,\r\nrepeating the end of each phrase.\r\n\r\nBut this trifling is kept in the background, and does not in the least\r\ninterfere with the tender character of the air. The second part (Allegro\r\ngrazioso, 3-4), although light and cheerful, does not approach the first\r\nin originality and depth. The cavatina in the second act (15) expresses\r\na simple, fervent emotion in a beautiful melody; the whole piece, both\r\nin design and execution, shows Mozart's manner most unmistakably; and\r\nis marked by a certain individuality of conception which transcends all\r\ntechnical readiness and skill. On the other hand, the song (17) which\r\nRosine sings in her _rôle_ of affected simplicity, is cheerful and\r\nfresh, but not particularly striking.\r\n\r\nThe part of Cassandro is not on a par with the two we have been\r\nconsidering. Caratoli, for whom it was written was past his best days\r\nas a singer, but he was an excellent actor, and \"knew how to dispense in\r\nsome measure with singing\"; he generally played old men, and his desire\r\nto please the multitude led him into occasional extravagances.[23] His\r\npart is specially adapted to the peculiarities of the Italian buffo; it\r\ncontains rapid declamation, well-applied pauses, strong contrasts, and\r\nother similar conventional effects; but not much original conception of\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(80)\r\n\r\ncomic character. In one song, indeed, we have a clever expression given\r\nto the not over-refined words:--\r\n\r\n     E son come un can barbone,\r\n     Frà la carne ed il bastone,\r\n     Vorrei stender lo zampino\r\n     E al baston più m' avvicino\r\n     E abbaiando, mugilando\r\n     Piglio il porco e me ne vö.\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n\r\n{CASSANDRO.}\r\n\r\n(8l)\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nWe must not indeed compare such jesting as this, however it may have\r\nbeen applauded at the time, with the delicate humour of Figaro. The\r\ncomposer is not at his best; but much of the blame lies at the door of\r\nthe poet who wrote such trash, and of the performer who would accept\r\nonly slight indications of the music to be sung, that he might win\r\napplause by his own elaboration of it. But youthful inexperience and\r\nignorance of the minds of men must also naturally have narrowed the\r\nboy's ideas. It is a sufficient proof of his thoroughly artistic nature\r\nthat his fun was exempt from childish extravagance.\r\n\r\nThe two pairs of lovers are not of equal prominence. The somewhat timid\r\nand indolent Giacinta is a difficult subject for musical representation.\r\nIn her first song she declares(3)--\r\n\r\n     Mari to io vorrei, ma senza fatica,\r\n     Averlo, se commoda, lasciarlo, se intrica;\r\n\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(82)\r\n\r\nthe husband is to be--\r\n\r\n     Un uoroo d' ingegno\r\n     Ma fatto di legno.\r\n\r\nThis is not exactly the state of mind for a prima donna. The music that\r\nshe sings is harmonious and pleasing, but, with the exception of a happy\r\nturn here and there, not above the average. Only the song in the third\r\nact (24) expresses dismay at the pretended flight with a tragic pathos,\r\nwhich, though of course exaggerated, is well sustained, both by the\r\nvoice and the accompaniment. The conception of this part was doubtless\r\ninfluenced by the individuality of the singer for whom it was written.\r\nAccording to Sonnenfels this was Signora Eberhardi.\r\n\r\n\"She has an agreeable contralto voice, and a style which pleases\r\nuniversally. Her shakes certainly degenerate sometimes into a quake, and\r\nif the tempo is taken very fast she fails to keep pace with it. In her\r\nacting she suffers the natural to pass into the artificial, and her\r\nconventional gestures are often constrained.\"[24]\r\n\r\nFracasso is a lover of the usual type, rough and impetuous as becomes a\r\nHungarian officer, quarrelsome with the two brothers, but without marked\r\nindividuality. This it was impossible for so young a composer as Mozart\r\nto evolve out of such commonplace and insignificant materials. The part\r\nwas cast for Laschi, whom Sonnenfels[25] praises as a cultivated artist,\r\nand a buffo actor of the most refined and intelligent type. He still\r\nplayed first lover's parts, but was much commiserated on account of the\r\nloss of certain notes of his voice, a defect which he sought to hide by\r\ntransposing airs and passages.\r\n\r\nSimone is an ordinary valet, blunt rather than rude, and merry, all\r\nwhich is well represented by the music, the part seldom rising,\r\nhowever, above the ordinary buffo level. Most genial and telling is the\r\nsong(13)--\r\n\r\n     Con certe persone Vuol esser bastone--\r\n\r\n\r\n{NINETTA--SOLO SONGS.}\r\n\r\n(83)\r\n\r\nand the concluding refrain \"Madama, bastone!\" is pretty and comical.\r\nPoggi, who took the servants' and peasants' parts, possessed a fine bass\r\nvoice and correct execution, together with a charming style of acting,\r\nand was the favourite of connoisseurs.[26]\r\n\r\nThe character most devoid of colour is that of Ninetta, and we find\r\nin it no foretaste of a Susannah or a Despina. It can only have been\r\nintended for Bemasconi, who had made a great sensation as Sandrina in\r\nPiccini's \"Buona Figliola,\" and in Sacchini's \"Contadina in Corte.\"[27]\r\nIt is indicative of the healthiness of Mozart's genius that some of the\r\nsongs for these less important personages were rewritten several times,\r\nno doubt at the request of the performers.[28] Where any natural emotion\r\nor characteristic situation is to be represented, his judgment is at\r\nonce correct and decided; but in unimportant matters he is ready to\r\nyield to the wishes of the singers and the public, and to attempt\r\nvarious modes of expression in search of what is pleasing and\r\nharmonious.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the prevailing fashion, solo songs abound in this\r\nopera; each character has two or three, Rosine has four, and the total\r\nnumber amounts to twenty. The majority are formed on the same model, the\r\nusual one of the day.\r\n\r\nThey have a long ritomello, and consist of two movements, differing in\r\ntime, measure, and key, which are generally both repeated; each movement\r\nis woven into one long thread, the motifs being sometimes repeated, but\r\nnever really worked out. This clumsy form gives few opportunities\r\nfor dramatic effect, and is especially adapted for the singer who is\r\ndesirous of displaying his own,\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, those songs which have most originality disregard\r\nsuch rules, and their form is rounder,\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(84)\r\n\r\nmore self-contained and complete. In these, little opportunity is given\r\nfor a display of execution; the melodies are simple, ornamental passages\r\nand runs few in number,[29] and little beyond the cadenzas is left to\r\nthe singers' discretion. The natural expression of feeling in the songs\r\nis never inconsistent with the style of an opera buffa; all is cheerful,\r\nlight, and easy of apprehension.\r\n\r\nBy the side of these numerous airs, there is only one duet between\r\nFracasso and Cassandro (19), of a purely comic character; Cassandro\r\nassumes an air of arrogant importance, but, terrified in reality, seeks\r\nby any means to escape from the proposed duel. This is animated, and\r\nmust have been very effective at the time; but it is in reality a solo\r\nfor the bass buffo, for Fracasso has only detached ejaculations, and the\r\ntwo voices never go together.\r\n\r\nEach act of the opera ends with a finale, in which the action,\r\nincreasing in intensity through the several scenes, is wound up and\r\nrepresented to the audience in a connected and coherent form. Clearly\r\ndefined rules left little scope for originality in the arrangement and\r\ncomposition of these finales. Changes of time, measure, and key took\r\nplace according to rule with every change of situation; and each\r\nmovement formed a complete and detached whole. When the action becomes\r\nanimated, or the dialogue rapid, the orchestra, by means of retaining\r\nand developing a characteristic motif, supplies a framework from which\r\nindividual dramatic features can be detached without risk of the whole\r\nfalling asunder.\r\n\r\nThe skilful modelling of a composition from its purely musical aspect,\r\nis as important to true artistic workmanship as is the vivid delineation\r\nof individual character; only a consummate master of his art can\r\nbe expected to bring both these elements to perfection. The first\r\npredominates in these finales.\r\n\r\nThe design and modelling of each subject is firm and\r\n\r\n{FINALES--OVERTURE.}\r\n\r\n(85)\r\n\r\nflowing. The voices are not artificially involved, but free and\r\nindependent throughout; the orchestra is cleverly handled and treated\r\nwith due consideration, whether it comes to the front, or remains as an\r\naccompaniment in the background.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation is rich, and even where the rapid progress of the\r\naction causes difficulties, it is full of effects of light and shade.\r\n\r\nThe wind instruments are frequently employed independently; and there\r\nis already visible the germ of Mozart's inimitable art of combining\r\norchestra and voices with mutual independence into perfect unity. The\r\nsituations and characters are fitly and dramatically expressed by the\r\norchestra, though not in so striking a degree as in the airs. Creative\r\npower is not so prominent here as the dexterity with which the various\r\nparts are moulded together. Even with his extraordinary gifts, such a\r\nmere boy could not satisfy in an equal degree the very great and varied\r\ndemands made upon him face to face with such a task as this; the only\r\nwonder is that Mozart did not yield to the temptation of producing\r\nbrilliant effects at the cost of artistic unity.\r\n\r\nThese finales make a perfectly harmonious effect, and wanting as they\r\nare in depth and vigour, preserve throughout the genuine character of an\r\nopera buffa. The last movement of each finale is for four voices, and is\r\nsung by all the personages present; a similar movement opens the opera.\r\nThey are very simple, the voices in harmony, to a varied figure on the\r\nviolins, generally only a sort of paraphrase of the principal subject;\r\nthe other instruments fill in the harmonies, so that the whole has a\r\nrapid, busy effect.\r\n\r\nThe overture (Sinfonia) is, according to established custom, in three\r\nmovements, the two first being in two divisions. It is a symphony,\r\ncomposed previously on January 16 (45 K.), and prefixed to the opera\r\nwith the omission of the minuet. There are a few minor alterations,\r\nchiefly in the instrumentation. The symphony had originally trumpets\r\nand drums, which were omitted in the overture, while flutes and bassoons\r\nwere added. This is unquestionably the weakest part of the opera, and\r\nthe middle movement is\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(86)\r\n\r\nespecially poor; but little importance was then attached to the\r\noverture, and it is not worse than others of its day.\r\n\r\nTo sum up our criticism, the opera was a worthy rival to those already\r\nin possession of the stage, and portions of it may fairly be said\r\nto surpass them in nobility and originality both of invention and\r\nexecution, while it points unmistakably to a glorious future for its\r\ncomposer. Surely this is extraordinary praise for the work of a boy!\r\n\r\nThe manuscript score is clearly a fair copy, but not without\r\ncorrections. Some of these are of mistakes in the copying; others,\r\nalthough seldom, are alterations probably demanded by the performers,\r\neither curtailments or additions. The additions are for the most part\r\nto the closing phrases, which Mozart, as a rule, cut very short; the\r\nsingers, mindful of a good exit, demanded their prolongation. The hand\r\nof L. Mozart is discernible throughout; the indications of the tempo,\r\nof the persons, instruments, &c., the minute directions as to execution,\r\nare almost all in his handwriting.\r\n\r\nThere are also some indications of his having revised the composition in\r\nunimportant trifles. But this score, being a copy, can offer no evidence\r\nas to the influence of L. Mozart's advice and corrections on the\r\ncompositions of his son; we can well understand that at the time this\r\ninfluence was thought to be overpowering; now that Wolfgang's career and\r\ndevelopment lie open before us, we rate it at next to nothing.\r\n\r\nAlthough L. Mozart was denied the satisfaction of witnessing the public\r\nrecognition of his son's genius by the performance of this opera, yet\r\na good opportunity was afforded him of asserting his dramatic talent\r\nbefore a small circle of connoisseurs. The Mozarts became acquainted\r\nwith a Dr. Messmer,[30] who had married a rich wife, and who kept\r\n\r\n{ROUSSEAU'S \"DEVIN DU VILLAGE.\"}\r\n\r\n(87)\r\n\r\nopen house for a select and cultivated circle. Heufeld was among the\r\nnumber of his friends. Dr. Messmer was musical, and had built an amateur\r\ntheatre; here was performed, a little German opera composed by Wolfgang,\r\nwith the title \"Bastien und Bastienne\" (50 K.).\r\n\r\nWe must here revert to J. J. Rousseau's intermezzo, \"Le Devin du\r\nVillage,\" the origin of which he describes in the eighth book of his\r\n\"Confessions.\"[31] The pleasure which he had derived during his stay\r\nin Italy from the performances of the opera buffa was revived in 1752 at\r\nPassy, where he encountered a zealous musical friend, Musard, who\r\nshared the same tastes. This suggested to Rousseau the idea of placing\r\nsomething of the same kind on the French stage; in a few days the plan\r\nof the piece, the text, and some of the music were sketched out, and\r\nwithin six weeks, the poem and composition were complete. At a private\r\nrehearsal, which Duclos arranged, the operetta made a great sensation,\r\nand attracted the attention of the manager _des menus plaisirs_, De\r\nCury, who ordered and directed a performance of it at court.\r\n\r\nIt was twice (on October 18 and 24,1752) performed before the King at\r\nFontainebleau, Mdlles. Fel and Jeliotte singing Colette and Colin, with\r\ngreat applause. Then it was given publicly in Paris before the Académie\r\nRoyale de Musique on March 1, 1753, and met with great and universal\r\napprobation.[32] From the King, who, \"with the worst voice in his whole\r\nkingdom,\" sang \"J'ai perdu mon serviteur,\" downwards, the couplets\r\nof the operetta were in every one's mouth, and it became popular to\r\na remarkable degree. In 1774 it received almost as much applause as\r\nGluck's \"Orpheus,\"[33]\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(88)\r\n\r\nand even in 1819 and 1821 German musicians were astonished at its\r\npopularity. It did not finally disappear from the stage until 1828.[34]\r\nThe plot could not be simpler:--\r\n\r\nColette, a village maiden, is inconsolable for her faithless swain,\r\nColin, and goes to a soothsayer for advice and assistance. He informs\r\nher that the lady of the manor has entangled Colin in her toils, but\r\nthat he is still faithful at heart, and will return to his first love;\r\nshe must punish him by pretended indifference, so as to inflame his\r\ndesires afresh; this she promises. Colin then enters; he is healed\r\nof his madness, and returns to his Colette. On being informed by\r\nthe soothsayer that she loves another, he, too, begs for help; the\r\nsoothsayer undertakes to summon Colette by magic, but Colin must himself\r\ndo the rest. Colette appears, and somewhat unsuccessfully plays the\r\nprude; her lover thereupon rushes off in despair, she calls him back,\r\nand then follow reconciliation and renewed assurance of love and\r\nconstancy. The soothsayer receives thanks and reward, and the assembled\r\nvillagers take part in the joy of the lovers.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity and naïve sentiments, which atone for the poverty of\r\nthe plot, are also characteristic of the music. A certain inequality\r\nin technical details, and here and there gross errors, betray the\r\namateur;[35] but there is a natural feeling in the melodies, and a\r\nplayful tenderness in the whole composition, which must have had an\r\nextraordinary effect at the time of its production. Rousseau, who\r\naimed at unity of tone before all things in this little sketch, was not\r\nsatisfied with furnishing the couplets with easy flowing melodies,\r\nbut bestowed great care on the recitatives, which, in imitation of\r\nthe Italian, were intended to be pieces of artistic and studied\r\ndeclamation.[36] The minute care with which he indicated the smallest\r\ndetail in the delivery of his recitatives is almost incredible; it is\r\nplain that he gave credit to the performers for no musical feeling or\r\npower of expression whatever.\r\n\r\nRousseau's opera coincided in point of time with the first\r\n\r\n{THE PARODY, \"BASTIEN ET BASTIBNNE.\"}\r\n\r\n(89)\r\n\r\nappearance of Italian opera buffa in Paris; and though he had avowedly\r\ntaken, this as his model, comparison serves only to prove the complete\r\noriginality of his work. It bore unmistakable traces of its nationality,\r\nand was French in feeling and tone.[37] The abiding impression created\r\nby it is best shown by the innumerable operas of the same kind, which\r\nfollowed closely in its rear,[38] such as \"Rose et Colas,\" \"Annette et\r\nLubin,\" \"La Clochette.\" The Comédie-Italienne ratified the success of\r\nthe \"Devin du Village\" in yet another way. According to the custom, by\r\nwhich every piece of any importance was parodied as soon as it appeared\r\non the stage, a parody of Rousseau's intermezzo appeared at the\r\nItaliens, September 26, 1753, with the title: \"Les Amours de Bastienet\r\nBastienne.\"[39]\r\n\r\nIt was composed by the witty and agreeable Madame Favart and Hamy,[40]\r\nand, without attempting to disparage the original, it transforms the\r\nArcadian idealism of Rousseau's shepherds into the unromantic realism of\r\ncountry life. Genuine French peasants express appropriate sentiments in\r\ntheir patois, and the whole piece is rustic and natural.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is strung together by well-known melodies, as was always\r\nthe case in vaudeville. The piece was highly applauded, owing its\r\nsuccess in great measure to the lively and natural acting of Madame\r\nFavart. She was the first actress who ventured to appear in the genuine\r\nsimple costume of a peasant woman, and her appearance in sabots created\r\na great sensation. Her portrait was painted in this\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(90)\r\n\r\ncharacter, and it had much to do in laying the foundation of her\r\nfame.[41]\r\n\r\nThe parody was elaborated into a German operetta. In Vienna, low comedy\r\nhad never entirely renounced the aid of music; Haydn composed his\r\noperetta \"Der neue Krumme Teufel\" for Kurz-Bemardon. When the more\r\nrefined comic opera was introduced by Hiller, it was accepted and\r\nimitated in Vienna. In 1764 Weiskem translated Madame Favart's parody\r\nwith some slight alterations,[42] and to this text Mozart composed the\r\nmusic.[43] The piece is a continuous dialogue, interrupted by isolated\r\nsongs and duets at appointed places. These, consisting of eleven solo\r\nsongs, three duets, and one terzet do not always correspond to those\r\nof Rousseau's opera, which was unknown to the adapter; many songs have\r\nseveral verses, of which Mozart has only transcribed the first.\r\n\r\nThe French parody has been most unskilfully travestied, as will be seen\r\nby a comparison of the first song in its various forms.\r\n\r\nROUSSEAU.\r\n\r\n     J'ai perdu tout mon bonheur;\r\n     J'ai perdu mon serviteur:\r\n     Colin me délaisse.\r\n     Hélas! il a pu changer!\r\n     Je voudrois n'y plus songer:\r\n     J'y songe sans cesse.\r\n\r\nMADAME FAVART.\r\n\r\n     (Air: J'ai perdu mon äne.)\r\n     J'ons pardu mon ami!\r\n     Depis c' tems-là j'nons point dormi,\r\n     Je n' vivons pû qu'à d'mi.\r\n     J'ons pardu mon ami,\r\n     J'en ons le cour tout transi,\r\n     Je m' meurs de souci.\r\n\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S \"BASTIEN ET BASTIENNE.\"}\r\n\r\n(91)\r\n\r\nWEISKERN.\r\n\r\n     Mein liebster Freund hat mich verlassen,\r\n     Mit ihm ist Schlaf und Ruh dahin;\r\n     Ich weiss vor Leid mich nicht zu fassen,\r\n     Der Kummer schwächt mir Aug' und Sinn.\r\n     Vor Gram und Schmerz Erstarrt das Herz,\r\n     Und diese Noth Bringt mir den Tod.\r\n\r\nThe verses are equally tame and clumsy all the way through; and even\r\ntaking into account the prevailing low standard of cultivation and\r\ntaste, it is difficult to believe that this operetta could have been\r\nproduced at a private house of any importance.[44]\r\n\r\nMozart has given his music a strictly pastoral character, indicated,\r\nwherever possible, by its outward form. The orchestral introduction\r\n(Intrada) an Allegro (3-4) of about seventy bars, begins with a pastoral\r\ntheme--\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\ninterrupted by quick passages for oboes and horns, plainly intended to\r\nexpress a disturbance of the peaceful shepherd's life; this passes into\r\na tender pianissimo, prefiguring Bastienne's song. Holmes remarks that\r\nthe subject reminds one of Beethoven's Sinfonia Eroica, and still more\r\nso as the overture proceeds; but no one, it is to\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(92)\r\n\r\nbe hoped, would think of an actual reminiscence. Both the melody and\r\nits accompaniment, particularly the holding down of the bass note or the\r\nfifth, often of both, are meant to suggest bagpipes.\r\n\r\nOnly the stringed instruments are employed; and a curious effect is\r\nproduced by the first violins giving the fundamental note to the melody\r\non the open string of G or D. The bagpipes are imitated again in a\r\nlittle passage, with which Colas enters, playing the bagpipes:--\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nIn this passage Mozart has jokingly introduced a G sharp to imitate the\r\nsound between G and G sharp, which wind instruments sometimes emit,\r\nwhen unskilfully handled.[45] All these little tricks had already been\r\nbrought in to his \"Galimathias\" (p. 45).\r\n\r\nComparing this operetta with the \"Finta Semplice,\" we find that the\r\nformer is as distinctively German in execution and colouring as the\r\nlatter is Italian. What amount of direct influence Hiller's operas had\r\nupon \"Bastien and Bastienne\"\r\n\r\n(Op. 30, 5), and others in Mendelssohn's \"Midsummer Night's Dream.\"\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S \"BASTIEN ET BASTIENNE.\"}\r\n\r\n(93)\r\n\r\nit is difficult to say, but there can be no doubt that the intention of\r\nboth composers was the same.\r\n\r\nSimplicity and directness of expression being essential, the songs are\r\ndestitute both of runs and florid passages, and the fashioning of the\r\nmelodies is decidedly German, generally taking the ballad form; where\r\na more elaborate working is attempted, we may indeed trace Italian\r\ninfluence, but the style is invariably simplified.\r\n\r\nThe conventional form of the aria in two parts, with the repetition of\r\nthe first or both, and the usual variations, is not adhered to: and\r\nwhen an aria consists of two parts, it has no Da capo.[46] So, too, the\r\ncadence, which had become almost a rule in Italian songs--is employed\r\nonly once or twice.\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThe whole composition displays little inventive faculty,. and there\r\nare no pieces of the same significance as some of those in the Italian\r\nopera; here and there is a slight uncertainty of rhythm or harmony, and\r\noccasionally also obsolete turns of expression.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand', there are not wanting passages full of grace and\r\ntenderness, the harmony is often well chosen and even bold, and the\r\noperetta is so far Mozart's best expression of simple sentiment coming\r\ndirect from the heart.\r\n\r\nHis dramatic talent again asserts itself unmistakably; the three\r\ncharacters are boldly sketched, and many little comic touches are\r\nthrown into relief, as, for instance, the song in which Colas practises\r\nhocus-pocus, the duet in which Bastienne to all Bastien's despairing\r\nresolutions answers only: \"Viel Glück!\" and others. The technical\r\nworking-out is very simple. Neither in the duets nor in the closing\r\nterzet are the voices interwoven; but they\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(94)\r\n\r\nalternate with each other, or proceed together in simple harmony;\r\nonly in one instance does there occur a short imitative passage. The\r\norchestra usually goes with the voice, to which a simple, well-arranged\r\nbass is provided, the other parts filling in the harmonies. An\r\naccompaniment with any independent phrasing is rarely met with.\r\nThe accompaniment is mainly intrusted to the stringed instruments,\r\nstrengthened by oboes (on one occasion by two flutes) and horns, but\r\nonly to fill in the harmonies. Horns are also employed obbligato, and\r\nwith charming effect, in Bastienne's second song, \"Ich geh jetzt auf die\r\nWeide.\"\r\n\r\nIt says much for the artistic feeling and true discrimination of a boy\r\nof twelve years old, that he not only displays a mastery of operatic\r\nform, and a rare dramatic and inventive genius, but that he is able\r\nto grasp and appreciate the essential differences, both artistic and\r\nnational, between German and Italian opera.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that his first dramatic attempts should, so to\r\nspeak, touch the two extremes, which it was to be his mission to bring\r\ntogether. One song of Bastien's (10), with slightly altered words\r\nand clavier accompaniment, \"Daphne, deine Rosenwangen,\" and another,\r\n\"Freude, Königin der Weisen\" (52, 53, K.), were printed in a musical\r\nserial,[47] the editor, no doubt, thinking to make his profit with the\r\nname of the youthful prodigy.\r\n\r\nAmong the occasional compositions, which were numerous during Mozart's\r\nstay in Vienna, two symphonies must be mentioned. The first, in F major\r\n(43 K.), falling within the year 1767, is only noticeable for its middle\r\nmovement, which is an elaboration of the duet in \"Hyacinthus,\" already\r\nmentioned (p. 62 ). The second, in D major, dated December 13,1768 (48\r\nK.), is very animated, and has some striking features.\r\n\r\nConsiderable doubt still exists on the subject of a quintet, in B flat\r\nmajor (46 K.), which, according to Kochel's unimpeachable authority is\r\npreserved in Mozart's boyish\r\n\r\n{QUINTET IN B FLAT MAJOR, AND SERENADE.}\r\n\r\n(95)\r\n\r\nhand-writing in the archives of the Austrian Musikverein; it has many\r\ncorrections, and the date appended, in a strange hand certainly,\r\nbut coinciding with the composition, is \"d. 25 Januar (Mozart writes\r\nJanner), 1768.\" This quintet, for two violins, two tenors, and\r\nvioloncello, contains the four principal movements (omitting the second\r\nminuet, the romance, and the variations) of the great serenade for wind\r\ninstruments belonging to the year 1780 (361 K); the substance is here\r\nin its integrity, with only the necessary alterations to adapt it for\r\nstrings.\r\n\r\nClose examination leaves hardly any doubt that the composition was\r\noriginally intended for wind instruments; finer effects are produced in\r\nthe serenade, and are obviously not interpolated; the quintet betrays\r\nitself as an arrangement by evident efforts to bring out given effects.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the serenade must be considered also as a very early work,\r\nand the omission of the three movements in the quintet affords no reason\r\nfor ascribing them to a different period. Nevertheless, the conception\r\nand workmanship of these movements, and the scientific mastery of the\r\nart therein displayed, belong to the maturity of manhood, and make it\r\ndifficult to give credence to the handwriting of the manuscript rather\r\nthan to this internal evidence.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart's hope of seeing an opera by Wolfgang on the Vienna stage was,\r\nas we have seen, destroyed; but he was not altogether deprived of the\r\nsatisfaction to be afforded him by a public display of his son's genius.\r\nThey had become acquainted with the celebrated Father Ign. Parhammer, a\r\nJesuit, who had been especially zealous in purifying the land since\r\nthe emigration of the Protestants from Salzburg in 1733; [48] he took a\r\nprominent position in Vienna, and became father confessor to the Emperor\r\nFrancis I. in 1758. In the following year he was made director of\r\nthe Orphan Asylum, which he extended and reorganised with remarkable\r\nactivity, making it at length one of the most noted of such\r\ninstitutions.[49] In all similar institutions conducted by the Jesuits\r\nin Germany, the musical education of the orphans was\r\n\r\n{THE FIRST OPERA IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(96)\r\n\r\nconsidered next in importance to their religious duties,[50] and in this\r\ncase the result was so striking that the Emperor intended employing them\r\nin his operatic company.[51] Parhammer sometimes invited the Mozarts;\r\nand when the foundation stone of a new chapel was laid in the summer\r\nthey were present and met the Emperor, who conversed with Wolfgang about\r\nhis opera. Soon after he was commissioned to prepare the music for the\r\nmass to celebrate the dedication of the chapel, with the addition of an\r\noffertory and a trumpet concerto, to be performed by one of the boys.\r\nThe latter is not preserved; the Mass in G major (49 K.), the first\r\nwhich Mozart had written, betrays, as might be expected, the uncertainty\r\nof boyish workmanship more than any previous work. It is written for\r\nchorus and solos which do not merely alternate with the chorus in short\r\nphrases; \"Et in Spiritum Sanctum\" is an independent solo for the bass;\r\nBenedictus, a solo quartet. The plan, modelling, and execution of the\r\nmusic are quite of the conventional type of a Missa brevis; it is almost\r\ndevoid of original invention, and bears no signs of those stirrings of\r\ngenius which we have remarked in previous works. This want has not\r\nbeen without influence on the working-out of the music. The imitative\r\nphrasing is stiffer and less free than elsewhere; only the little\r\nregulation fugue \"Et vitam\" shows the result of study; and the impetuous\r\nOsanna--\r\n\r\n{FIRST MASS IN G MAJOR.}\r\n\r\n(97)\r\n\r\n[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nis vigorous and well finished. The Offertory, \"Veni, Sancte Spiritus\"\r\n(47 K.), in C major is lively and brilliant, with trumpets and drums.\r\nThe closing \"Alleluia\" is almost too gay, but it is pretty and fresh,\r\nreminding one of Caldara's easier pieces.\r\n\r\nThe performance, which Wolfgang conducted, took place on December 7,\r\n1768, in the presence of the imperial court, and confirmed, as the\r\nfather writes home, that which their enemies by opposition to the opera\r\nhad sought to disprove; convincing the court and the numerous audience\r\nassembled, of Wolfgang's right to a place of honour among composers.\r\n\r\nThe following is the testimony of a contemporary journal:[52]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 7th, his Imperial Majesty, with the Archdukes\r\nFerdinand and Maximilian, and the Archduchesses Maria Elizabeth and\r\nMaria Amelia were pleased to repair to the Orphan Asylum on the Rennweg,\r\nin order to be present at the first festival service and dedication of\r\nthe newly erected chapel.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the entrance to the chapel were stationed the\r\ncompanies of body guards with their bands. The royal party were received\r\nby his Eminence the Cardinal Archbishop of this place with his attendant\r\nclergy, amid the flourish of trumpets and drums, and the discharge of\r\nguns and cannons. The service of the dedication was conducted by his\r\nEminence, and the mass by the suffragan Bishop Marxer, with repeated\r\ndischarge of fire-arms.\r\n\r\nThe entire music, sung by the choir of orphans, was composed for the\r\noccasion by Wolfgang Mozart, son of Dr. L. Mozart, Kapellmeister at\r\nSalzburg, a boy twelve years of age, well known for his extraordinary\r\ntalent; it was conducted by the composer with the utmost precision and\r\naccuracy, and was received with universal applause and admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The extracts from L.

THE ITALIAN TOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Archbishop could not but feel flattered at the accomplishments of\r\nthe young Salzburger, and he endeavoured, as far as lay in his power,\r\nto complete the partial success of the visit to Vienna by ordering a\r\nperformance of Wolfgang's opera in Salzburg, notwithstanding that it was\r\n\"an opera buffa,\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(98)\r\n\r\nrequiring performers of a buffo character.\" The programme, recovered by\r\nKöchel[1] gives the following [See Page Image] [2]cast:--\r\n\r\nThe performance must have taken place on the fête-day of the Archbishop\r\nor some similar festive occasion, and upon a stage specially erected in\r\nthe archiepiscopal palace.\r\n\r\n{SALZBURG--MASS IN D MINOR.}\r\n\r\n(99)\r\n\r\n1748, \"La Clemenza di Tito\" was given by the Signori Paggi di Corte, who\r\nplayed even the female parts, or of the chapel.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom on such occasions at the close of the performance to\r\naddress the person in whose honour it was given, generally in the form\r\nof an air with recitative, concluding with a chorus; this peroration,\r\nwhich had no connection with the body of the opera, was called\r\n_licenza_) Two such, composed by Wolfgang for Archbishop Sigismund,\r\nare still preserved; a tenor air (36 K.) and a soprano air (70 K.), both\r\nwith long recitatives, giving testimony to increasing dexterity in the\r\ntreatment of form.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the opera was followed on the side of the Archbishop\r\nby the announcement of Wolfgang's appointment as Concertmeister, and he\r\nwas accordingly so entered in the Court Calendar of 1770.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the year 1769 was spent quietly at Salzburg in\r\nstudies of which we know but little. The only compositions which can\r\ncertainly be ascribed to this year are seven minuets for two violins and\r\nbass, composed January 26, 1769,[3] and two masses; they are all of the\r\nnature of studies. The first of the masses, in D minor, dated January\r\n14, 1769 (65 K.), noteworthy on account of the minor key, is a missa\r\nbrevis, and keeps strictly to that form, both in choruses and solos; in\r\nthe Credo the words \"Genitum, non factum--consubstantialem Patri--per\r\nquem omnia facta sunt,\" are distributed to three voices, and sung\r\ntogether. The different phrases, though well formed, have a certain\r\nabruptness, showing that the skill to continue and develop the\r\nsuggestions of the mind was still wanting. But the ordering of the\r\ndetails and the counterpoint are both excellent, and bear many marks of\r\noriginality.\r\n\r\nAs an example the fugue--\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(100)\r\n\r\nis unusual, but has a striking effect in this place. Mozart evidently\r\nenters more into the spirit of his work as the mass proceeds, and\r\ngives his impulses freer play. The Benedic-tus apparently gave him some\r\ntrouble. First, it was written for all four voices, then for soprano\r\nsolo, and lastly as a duet for soprano and alto, this last arrangement\r\nbeing twice elaborated. The alterations in the details show how precise\r\nhe was in this work. [See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the Dona--\r\n\r\nDo - na, do - na no - bis\r\n\r\n{PATER DOMINICUS MASS.}\r\n\r\n(101)\r\n\r\npromises well, but fails to maintain the same level to the end. [See\r\nPage Image]\r\n\r\nThe second mass, in C major (66 K.), the \"Pater Domini-cus Mass,\" was\r\ncomposed in October, 1769, on the occasion of the first celebration of\r\nmass by Hagenauer's son, whose entrance into a monastery had formerly\r\ncaused Wolfgang to shed tears (p. 50).[4] The young composer put forth\r\nall his powers to produce a truly grand and brilliant festival mass.\r\n\r\nEvery part is well conceived and worked out, and considerable progress\r\nis observable in the mechanical details of the whole. The subjects\r\nare more important, and the passages for the violins, which are very\r\nprominent, have more distinct character; the different parts, too, have\r\nfreer play. But it is at the same time to be noted that the substance of\r\nthe work is not yet on a level with its broader scheme. A succession of\r\nindependent solos, which evidently served as the special embellishment\r\nof the mass, show a considerable effort to avoid a light operatic tone,\r\nand to combine dignity with easy and attractive grace.\r\n\r\nMozart's unequalled talent for pure and noble melody is as discernible\r\nhere as elsewhere, though it is crippled by a certain amount of\r\nconfusion of ideas. Curiously enough the Benedictus, a solo quartet, is\r\naccompanied only by the first violin, which plays round the voices with\r\na continuous running passage. There is a good effect in the Dona nobis,\r\nwhere the chorus answers the short solo phrases--\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(102)\r\n\r\nwith changes of lead and harmony. [See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThis mass serves as a proof that L. Mozart did not confine himself to\r\neducating his son as an operatic composer, but that he made him pass\r\nthrough a course of severe study in every branch of his art, with the\r\njust conviction that his genius, when fully trained and developed, would\r\nmark out a line for itself.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart's intention of taking Wolfgang to Italy remained firm as ever,\r\nand he considered their stay in Vienna as the first step towards its\r\naccomplishment. At that time, Italy was to musicians what she now is\r\nto painters and sculptors; a residence there was necessary to give the\r\nfinishing touches to their education, and _éclat_ to their reputation.\r\n\r\nMusic in Italy was not only an art universally diffused and esteemed, it\r\nwas _the_ Art _par excellence_. All classes shared the insatiable desire\r\nfor music everywhere--in the churches, the theatres, the streets, and\r\ntheir own homes; and the delicate appreciation and enthusiasm for what\r\nwas excellent were increased by practice and education. So in Italy\r\na national tradition for production as well as for taste had been\r\ngradually formed, a sort of musical climate, in which artists found\r\nit easy to breathe. They knew that they might rely confidently on the\r\nappreciation of the public, whose attention and intelligence urged\r\nthem to fresh efforts, while rewarding each success with sympathetic\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nOpera and church music were almost in equal favour, and afforded mutual\r\nsupport to each other. It was accordant with the brilliancy of royal\r\ncourts and rich cities to give operatic performances either at Carnival\r\ntime or on special festive occasions; no expense was spared to\r\nengage the most famous singers, male and female, and for every season\r\n(_stagione_) new operas were written, if possible by famous and\r\nfavourite composers. Again, the dignity of the Church required, at least\r\non great holy days, that the musical part of the worship should be grand\r\nand imposing; and the more\r\n\r\n{MUSIC IN ITALY.}\r\n\r\n(103)\r\n\r\nrichly endowed churches and monasteries were quite able to rival the\r\ntheatres. There was on every side a steady demand for musical production\r\nand execution, which offered abundant opportunity for the exercise of\r\nevery kind of talent.\r\n\r\nThe musical education of youth was principally intrusted to the Church.\r\nMonasteries and religious institutions were careful to train the musical\r\nstrength, which was later to be at their disposal; special\r\ninstitutions were founded, which were in part the origin of the future\r\nConservatoires, whose mission it was to train their scholars as\r\nsingers, instrumentalists, or composers, and in every case as thoroughly\r\ncultivated musicians. In Venice there were four such foundations in\r\nwhich boys, and more especially girls, received musical instruction,\r\npreparatory to devoting themselves to the service of the Church: the\r\nOspidale della Pietà, intended for foundlings; Ospedaletto, where\r\nSacchini was kapellmeister at this time; Gli Mendicanti, and Gli\r\nIncurabili, then under Galuppi's direction.[5] In Naples were similar\r\nestablishments, De Poveridi Gesù-Christo; Della Pietà de' Turchini; S.\r\nOnofrio; Loretto. Though all were originally intended as nurseries\r\nfor church music, yet they were of almost equal service to music of a\r\nsecular nature; indeed, the most highly gifted among the scholars were\r\nlikely to prefer the more brilliant and profitable career of the opera\r\nstage. But the separation was never complete; operatic composers for\r\nthe most part worked also for the churches, where opera singers and\r\neven professional instrumentalists were often heard. Ecclesiastics,\r\ntoo, practised music in various branches, often with zeal and success.\r\nAlthough this union of musical forces, through the overpowering\r\ninfluence of the opera, worked in time prejudicially on the dignity and\r\npurity of church music, yet there can be no doubt of its good effect on\r\nthe study of form and musical science. The result was all the greater,\r\nsince the almost instinctive steadfastness of the national taste\r\npreserved musicians from aberrations which are only to be checked by\r\nrigid limitations as to style and form. An art so formed,\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(104)\r\n\r\nwith so one-sided a cultivation, must of course die out in the end; but\r\nthe extraordinary accomplishments of numerous Italian masters cannot\r\nfail to impress us with admiration of the share which Italian music,\r\nin its fulness of life and activity, had in producing a true musical\r\natmosphere. It was indeed, this firm foundation of scientific knowledge\r\nwhich made possible a liberation of music from its confined Italian\r\nlimits without abandoning the laws of artistic formation.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances Italy enjoyed undisputed and unlimited\r\nsovereignty in all matters relating to music. Spain and England\r\nacknowledged it almost without reserve; in France, where the impulse\r\nproceeding originally from Italy, had been modified by national\r\ncharacteristics, the influence of Italy was now beginning to reassert\r\nitself. In Germany alone, the works of great masters (we need only\r\nremind our readers of the Bach family as representatives of German\r\nchurch music; of Keiser, the creator of German opera in Hamburg) bore\r\nwitness to an independent development of music. Even here it was not as\r\n\"German as the German oaks,\" and bore many traces of Italian or French\r\ninfluences; but the comprehension and cultivation of form, the substance\r\nand spirit of the music, are purely German. This German music, however,\r\nwas principally confined to Protestant North Germany; it was nourished\r\nby no favour from the great, and the colder artistic mind of North\r\nGermany hindered it from attaining the popularity which was enjoyed\r\nby music in Italy. At all the German courts, Protestant as well as\r\nCatholic, the opera was Italian; the Catholic church music was under the\r\nexclusive sway of Italian composers; all singers, male and female, were\r\neither born or educated in Italy, and so, for the most part, were the\r\ninstrumentalists, although it was in instrumental music that Germany\r\nfirst challenged the supremacy of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe curious attraction of Germans to Italy, which has existed in all\r\nages under different manifestations, must have worked with peculiar\r\npower on musicians.[6] The German\r\n\r\n{LEOPOLD' MOZART'S HOPES.}\r\n\r\n(105)\r\n\r\ncomposers of the last century (with the exception of the North German\r\nProtestant church composers) all studied and laid the foundation of\r\ntheir fame in Italy, even those who, like Handel and Gluck, possessed\r\noriginal power enough to enable them later to strike out a path for\r\nthemselves.[7]\r\n\r\nIt may be said that, in this sense, Mozart's pilgrimage to Rome was the\r\nlast of its kind; to him it was accorded, not, only to attain to the\r\nhighest aim of Italian opera but to break the bonds of nationality, by\r\nlending depth and substance to the Italian perfection of form, while,\r\nwith the wealth of knowledge acquired in Italy, he furnished artistic\r\nform and expression to the national opera of Germany.\r\n\r\nIn taking his son to Italy, L. Mozart had a twofold end in view.\r\nWolfgang was not so much to continue his scholastic training (that he\r\ncould have done at home) as to emerge from a narrow provincial existence\r\ninto the great world of art, and by extended experiences to gain the\r\nrefined taste of a cultivated man of the world. He was also to gain\r\nfresh laurels, and to prepare the way for a prosperous and glorious\r\nfuture. L. Mozart expected from the excitable Italians special interest\r\nand applause on account of Wolfgang's youth; and in this he was\r\nnot disappointed. But he soon found that no pecuniary gain was to be\r\nexpected from this journey, since all concerts (_accademie_) were given\r\nby exclusive companies, or by a public institute without entrance money;\r\nso that the artist could count on no receipts but a voluntary fee from\r\nthe _entrepreneur_, which was not usually large. Soon after his arrival\r\nin Italy L. Mozart remarks to his wife, a remark often repeated, that\r\nalthough not rich he has \"always a little more than is absolutely\r\nnecessary\"; and so bearing his main object in view, he is quite content.\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(106)\r\n\r\nConsidering the constant fulfilment of duty as the most important factor\r\nin education, he insisted on Wolfgang's continuing his regular studies\r\nduring their journey. A long list of compositions, partly suggested by\r\npassing events, partly set studies, bear witness to this. Wolfgang,\r\nwho was very fond of arithmetic (p. 22), asks his sister to send his\r\narithmetic book after him, so that he may go on with his sums. In Rome\r\nhe had a present of an Italian translation of the \"Arabian Nights,\"\r\nwhich amused him very much. Soon after we find him reading \"Telemachus.\"\r\nL. Mozart was too well informed himself to look upon this journey as\r\ninstructive merely from a musical point of view. His letters show\r\nthat he took interest in politics and social life, in nature, art, and\r\nantiquity; he sends home long descriptions of the journey, which are\r\nto serve as preliminaries to future conversations over the books and\r\nengravings he is collecting. Wolfgang evinced the same fresh interest in\r\neverything he saw, and offered no opposition to the care his father\r\ntook of his health. \"You know that he can be moderate,\" writes L. Mozart\r\n(February 17,1770), and I can assure you that I have never seen him so\r\ncareful of his health as in this country. He leaves alone all that he\r\ndoes not think good for him, and many days he eats but little; yet he\r\nis always fat and well, and merry and happy the whole day long. And from\r\nRome he writes (April 14, 1770), that Wolfgang \"takes as much care of\r\nhis health as if he were a grown man.\"\r\n\r\nNeither the honours with which he was everywhere overwhelmed, nor\r\nhis performances as a musician, had any effect in spoiling the\r\nunsophisticated nature of the boy; he was always bright and animated,\r\nfull of jokes and merry absurdities, and retaining a strong attachment\r\nto home and the home circle amid all the distractions of the journey. In\r\nhis letters to his sister, he falls into a ludicrous jargon, composed of\r\nany number of different languages, and of childish jokes and teasings,\r\nafter the manner of brothers and sisters who have grown up together and\r\nare under no sort of restraint in their intercourse.\r\n\r\nBut whenever the subject is connected with music, through all the joking\r\ntone can be traced a lively interest and a\r\n\r\n{INSPRUCK--ROVEREDO, 1770.}\r\n\r\n(107)\r\n\r\ndecided and impartial judgment; and the whole tone of his letters\r\nbreathes hearty sympathy and amiability. Fortunate circumstances and a\r\nsensible education had combined with the happiest result; and there can\r\nbe no doubt that the concentration of Mozart's early training on one\r\nobject had the indirect effect of keeping at a safe distance much that\r\nmight have been hurtful to his disposition.\r\n\r\nThe father and son left Salzburg at the beginning of December, 1769.[8]\r\nMany threads of personal recommendation stretched thence into the Tyrol\r\nand upper Italy, partly from mercantile connections, partly through the\r\nnoble families belonging to the Cathedral Chapter, and the travellers\r\nhad introductions which gained them admittance into widely different\r\ncircles. Their first stay was at Inspruck, where they were well received\r\nby Count Spaur, brother to the Salzburg Capitular. On December 14, at\r\na concert given by the nobility at the house of Count Künigl, Wolfgang\r\nplayed a concerto at sight, which had been put before him as a test of\r\nhis skill; at the close he was presented with it, and twelve ducats\r\nin addition. The Inspruck newspaper testified (December 18) that \"Herr\r\nWolfgang Mozart, whose extraordinary musical attainments have made him\r\nfamous alike in the imperial court, in England, France, Holland, and\r\nthroughout the Holy Roman Empire,\" had given in this performance the\r\nmost convincing proofs of his marvellous skill. \"This youthful musician,\r\nwho is just thirteen years old, has added fresh brilliancy to his\r\nfame, and has commanded the unanimous approbation of all musical\r\nconnoisseurs.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as they entered Italy the marks of honour with which the young\r\nartist was received became more animated and enthusiastic. At Roveredo\r\nthe nobles arranged a concert at the house of Baron Todeschi, who\r\nhad known Mozart at Vienna. \"There is no need to say how Wolfgang is\r\nreceived,\" writes his father. When he wanted to play the organ at the\r\nprincipal church, the report of it spread through\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(108)\r\n\r\nthe town, and the church was so full that it took two strong men to\r\nclear the way to the choir, and then it was a quarter of an hour before\r\nthey could get to the organ, they were so besieged by the audience.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm in Verona was still greater. As there was an opera every\r\nevening, a week elapsed before a concert could be arranged; but in the\r\nmeantime invitations poured in from the Marchese Carlotti, Count Giusti\r\ndel Giardino, Locatelli, &c.\r\n\r\nWolfgang performed a symphony of his own composition before a select\r\nassembly of connoisseurs, besides playing difficult pieces at sight, and\r\ncomposing a song to some dictated words, which he afterwards sang. The\r\nscene at Roveredo was repeated when he went to play the organ at St.\r\nThomas's Church. The press was so great that they were obliged to get\r\ninto the church through the monastery, and even then they could hardly\r\nhave reached the organ had not the monks formed a ring round them, and\r\nso made a way through the crowd. \"When it was over, the noise was still\r\ngreater, for every one wanted to see the little organist.\"\r\n\r\nNewspapers and poets vied with each other in extolling the marvellous\r\napparition. The Receiver-General, Pietro Lugiati, chief among\r\nintellectual dilettanti, caused a life-size portrait of Wolfgang at\r\nthe clavier to be painted in oils, and acquainted his mother with this\r\nhonour in a long letter which contained warm expressions of admiration\r\nfor the \"raro e portentoso giovane.\"[9]\r\n\r\nOn January 10 they entered Mantua well and hearty in spite of the cold;\r\nbut Wolfgangerl looked, his father said, owing to the fresh air and\r\nthe heat of the stove, \"as if he had gone through a campaign, a sort of\r\nreddish brown, particularly round the eyes and mouth, something like\r\nhis Majesty the Emperor.\" Here too, they were warmly received by all the\r\ndistinguished dilettanti of the place; Signora Bettinelli in especial\r\nlavished all a mother's care on\r\n\r\n{PROGRAMME OF CONCERT AT MANTUA, 1770.}\r\n\r\n(109)\r\n\r\nthe boy, and wept at parting from him. A Signora Sartoretti invited\r\nthem to dine with her, and sent by her servants a vase with a beautiful\r\nbouquet tied with red ribbon, and in the middle of the ribbon a piece of\r\nfour ducats folded in a poem addressed by the Signora to Wolfgang.\r\n\r\nOn January 16, the concert of the Philharmonic Society was given\r\nin their capital hall, Wolfgang being the principal performer. The\r\nprogramme, which we append, gives some idea of Wolfgang's performances\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\nSerie delle composizione musicali da eseguirsi nell' accademia pubblica\r\nfilarmonica di Mantova la sera del di 16 del corrente Gennajo, 1770.\r\n\r\nIn occasione della venuta del espertissimo giovanetto\r\n\r\nSign.

But wonderful as were Wolfgang's accomplishments\r\nas a clavier-player, violinist, and vocalist, they were thrown into the\r\nshade by his talents as a composer. Even in his public performances the\r\nprominence given to improvisation is remarkable, and the readiness\r\nwith which he adapted the most varied subjects, always fulfilling the\r\nconditions of musical art, presupposes not only great liveliness of\r\nimagination, but a perfect mastery of mechanical form. In estimating\r\nMozart's early acquirements, the most impressive fact to be noticed is\r\nthe absence of any exaggeration of feeling or over-cultivation; all is\r\nnatural and unstrained. His talent was no forced exotic, which springs\r\nup quickly and as quickly withers away; it was a plant of healthy\r\ngrowth, coming gradually to maturity; and the mechanical skill acquired\r\nin youth was the best foundation for the free creative power of manhood.\r\n\r\nFather and son arrived at Milan before the end of January, and found a\r\nsafe and comfortable lodging in the Augustine monastery of San Marco. A\r\nlay brother was appointed to wait on them, even to the warming of their\r\nbeds, which attention caused Wolfgang to be \"delighted when bedtime\r\ncame.\" Their warm friend and patron was the Governor-General, Count Carl\r\nJoseph von Firmian (b. 1716). He had been partly educated at Salzburg\r\n(where his elder brother Joh. Bapt. Anton was Archbishop until 1740),\r\nand had there founded a literary society, whose earnest endeavours after\r\na freer method of scientific inquiry had led to many hard struggles with\r\nauthority.[10] He afterwards studied at Leyden, and acquired cultivation\r\nand taste by frequent travels in France and Italy. As Ambassador at\r\nNaples, he won the heart of Winckelmann, who speaks of\r\n\r\n{MILAN, 1770.}\r\n\r\n(111)\r\n\r\nhim as one of the greatest, wisest, most humane, and most learned men of\r\nhis time and country.[11] Count Firmian was appointed Govemor-General\r\nof Lombardy in 1759, and spared no efforts to promote the material\r\nwell-being as well as the intellectual and artistic improvement of his\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nLike Münchhausen,[12] he was not only a patron, but an accomplished\r\njudge of science and of the arts, and his support and hospitality were\r\nfreely bestowed on artists and scholars. The Mozarts found a ready\r\nsympathiser in him, and his introduction to families of rank obtained\r\nfor them all the pleasures of the Carnival; they were invited to balls\r\nand masquerades, and were obliged to follow the fashion, and order\r\ndominos and _bajuti_ (caps, which covered the face to the chin and fell\r\nback over the shoulders).[13] L. Mozart thought they were exceedingly\r\nbecoming to Wolfgang, but shook his head over his own \"playing the fool\r\nin his old age,\" and consoled himself with the thought that the things\r\n\"could be used for linings afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nAt the opera, where they were often present, they made the acquaintance\r\nof the Maestro Piccinni, who was producing his \"Cesare in Egitto.\"\r\nWolfgang's performances at a public concert excited here as elsewhere\r\nthe wondering admiration of artists and amateurs. \"It is the same\r\nin this place as in others,\" writes L. Mozart, \"I need not\r\nparticularise.\"[14] The friendship which Wolfgang struck up with two\r\nclever young singers, of fourteen and fifteen years old, led to his\r\ncomposing for them two Latin motetts.\r\n\r\nBut Count Firmian imposed a severer task on the young musician. He gave\r\na brilliant soirée at his Palace, graced by the presence of the Duke of\r\nModena and his daughter, and the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan. Wolfgang\r\nwas commissioned to prepare for this soirée three songs to Metastasio's\r\nwords as a proof of his power to produce serious dramatic music.\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(112)\r\n\r\nThe principal piece was a grand aria with an accompanied recitative from\r\n\"Demofoonte,\" the celebrated and often-composed \"Misero pargoletto\"\r\n(77 K.). The recitative is very elaborate, in high tragic style; its\r\nforcible character is rendered chiefly by the orchestra.\r\n\r\nThe air consists of an Adagio with a Poco allegro interposed in the\r\nsame tone throughout. The two other songs (78, 79 K.) from Metastasio's\r\n\"Artaserse,\" \"Per pietà bel idol mio\" and \"Per quel paterne amplesso,\"\r\nhave each only one movement; the last song has a short introductory\r\nrecitative. In the two latter songs the simple Cantabile is embellished\r\nby bravura passages, which are wanting altogether in the first. They\r\nare all written for a soprano voice,[15] and stood the test as\r\nrepresentative of the dramatic song of the time. Count Firmian presented\r\nWolfgang with a snuff-box and 20 gigliati,[16] together with a copy of\r\nMetastasio's works. But the most important result of this soirée, and of\r\ntheir stay in Milan, was that Wolfgang was commissioned to write the new\r\nopera for the next season; the first singers--Gabrielli, with her sister\r\nand Ettore--were to be engaged for it, and the remuneration was fixed at\r\n100 gigliati and free quarters in Milan during their stay. The libretto\r\nwas to be sent after them, so that Wolfgang might make himself familiar\r\nwith it, the recitative was to be forwarded to Milan in October, and the\r\ncomposer to be there himself at the beginning of November, to complete\r\nthe opera in the neighbourhood of the singers, and to rehearse it\r\nfor production at Christmas. These conditions were both agreeable and\r\nconvenient, as they did not interfere with the journey through Italy,\r\nand allowed Wolfgang ample time to complete the opera quietly.\r\n\r\nMozart's first quartet was composed on the way from Milan to Parma, and\r\ndated Lodi, March 15, 7 o'clock in the evening (80 K.). At Parma the\r\ncelebrated singer Lucrezia Agujari, called \"la Bastardella,\" invited\r\nthem to sup with her, and sang so as to justify the reports they had\r\nheard of\r\n\r\n{\"LA BASTARDELLA\"--BOLOGNA, 1770.}\r\n\r\n(113)\r\n\r\nher execution and the fabulous compass of her voice. \"I could not have\r\nbelieved that she could sing to C in altissimo,\" writes L. Mozart, \"had\r\nI not heard it with my own ears. The passages which Wolfgang has written\r\nwere in her song, and she sang them somewhat softer than the deeper\r\nnotes, but as clearly as an octave pipe in an organ. In fact, the trills\r\nand all were note for note just as Wolfgang has written them down.\r\nBesides this she has good alto notes, as low as G. She is not handsome,\r\nbut certainly not ugly; has a wild look in her eyes at times, like\r\npeople who are subject to fits, and she limps with one leg. She has\r\nalways conducted herself well, and has therefore a good name and\r\nreputation.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 24 they arrived at Bologna. Here they were received by Field\r\nMarshal Count Pallavicini in a way that reminded them of Count Firmian.\r\n\"They are two noblemen,\" writes L. Mozart, \"who possess identical tastes\r\nand modes of thought, and are equally amiable, generous, and dignified.\"\r\nThe Count arranged a brilliant concert in his own house, attended by\r\n150 persons of the high nobility, among them the Cardinal Legate Antonio\r\nColonna Branci-forte, and the chief of connoisseurs--Padre Martini.\r\nThe company assembled at 8 o'clock, and did not disperse until near\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nL.. Mozart considered that Wolfgang made a greater effect in Bologna\r\nthan elsewhere, that city being the seat of so many artists and learned\r\nmen. Here they met the celebrated Spagnoletta (Gius. Useda), from Milan,\r\nthe kapellmeister, Vincenzo Manfredini, known also as an author, who had\r\nvisited them at Salzburg, on his journey from St. Petersburg in 1769,\r\nand the famous alto, Gius. Aprile.[17] Bologna, the father thought, and\r\nthought rightly, was the best centre whence Wolfgang's fame could spread\r\nover Italy, since he had there to stand the severest tests from Padre\r\nMartini, the idol of the Italians, and the acknowledged arbiter in all\r\nmatters of art. The Franciscan Giambattista Martini[18]\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(114)\r\n\r\n(born 1760) was esteemed not only as the composer of short, concise,\r\nartistically worked-out sacred pieces, but, from his thorough and\r\ncomprehensive researches, as unquestionably the most learned theoretical\r\nmusician of his day. Only one volume of his pedantic \"Storia della\r\nMusica\" had as yet appeared, and his classical work on counterpoint was\r\nonly in preparation;[19] but he was already considered infallible on\r\nall musical questions, both in Italy and abroad. His possession of\r\nan unequalled musical library[20] placed him in correspondence with\r\nnumerous musicians, scholars, and princes. Disputed points were\r\nsubmitted to his arbitration, and his advice was sought in the bestowal\r\nof official places. A recommendation from Padre Martini was the\r\nbest possible key to success. His authority was the more readily\r\nacknowledged, since he united to his rare attainments a singular degree\r\nof modesty, and a ready alacrity to afford instruction, counsel,\r\nor assistance whenever required. He preserved, even in his learned\r\ndisputes, invariable dignity and amiability,[21] with a certain amount\r\nof cautious reserve. L. Mozart might well be anxious to win the favour\r\nof such a man for his son. Whenever they visited him Padre Martini\r\ngave Wolfgang a fugue to work out, which was always done to the great\r\ncontrapuntist's entire satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe companion figure to this learned monk was a musical celebrity of\r\nquite another kind, whose acquaintance Mozart also made in Bologna.\r\nFarinelli (Carlo Broschi, b. 1705), a pupil of Porpora, first appeared\r\nin 1722 in Metastasio's \"Angelica,\" and an intimacy resulted between\r\nthe singer and the poet (who called him his _caro gemello_) which had an\r\nimportant effect on the development of Italian opera. Farinelli's career\r\nin Italy was an unbroken success, and he was enthusiastically received\r\nin Vienna and London.[22] Arriving in Spain in 1736, his singing had\r\npower to dispel the\r\n\r\n{FARINELLI--FLORENCE, 1770.}\r\n\r\n(115)\r\n\r\nmelancholy of Philip V.; he was summoned daily to the king's presence, and\r\nbecame his acknowledged favourite, a position which he retained under\r\nFerdinand VI. and Queen Barbara. On the accession of Charles III., in\r\n1761, Farinelli was obliged to leave Spain, and living in wealthy ease\r\nat Bologna, indulged his tastes for art and science. He practised the\r\namiable and refined hospitality of a cultivated man of the world in his\r\nbeautiful villa, and took peculiar interest in his fellow-artists, who\r\nnever failed even in his old age to be charmed with his singing.[23]\r\n\r\nThe reports that have come down to us concerning the compass and beauty\r\nof his voice, concerning his way of taking breath, his _portamento_,\r\nhis declamation,[24] are as wonderful as was the success of this king\r\nof artists both in public and at court. He appears almost as a\r\npersonification of the greatness and power of song in the last century,\r\nof which we can scarcely form a true conception, and which cause the\r\nhistory of music in that age to be mainly a history of song and singers.\r\nThe period of Mozart's musical education was still under this influence,\r\nand, although the absolute sovereignty of song was soon to decline, the\r\nimpression made on him in his youth by Farinelli and other great singers\r\nwas not likely to be forgotten.[25]\r\n\r\nOn March 30 the travellers reached Florence. Their Austrian\r\nintroductions secured them a most favourable reception in this city.\r\nThe imperial ambassador, Count Rosenberg, immediately made known their\r\narrival at court, where they were very graciously received by the\r\nArchduke Leopold, He recollected their former stay at Vienna, and\r\ninquired after Nannerl. Wolfgang played at court on April 2, accompanied\r\nby Nardini, the celebrated violinist; the Marquis de Ligniville,\r\ndirector of music, laid the most difficult fugues before Wolfgang to\r\nwork out; he accomplished everything \"with as much ease as eating a\r\npiece of bread.\"\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(116)\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Ligniville, Duca di Conca, &c., was considered one of the\r\nmost thorough masters of counterpoint in Italy. As a proof of his skill\r\nhe had written a \"Salve Regina\"[26] and \"Stabat Mater\" for three parts,\r\nin the form of different kinds of canon. To the latter work is prefixed\r\na long treatise (dated April 11, 1767) for the Philharmonic Society in\r\nBologna, of which he was a member; the object of the treatise was to\r\nshow that in accurate contrapuntal works the traditions of the old\r\nRoman school were preserved. In accordance with this view Ligniville\r\napologises ironically to followers of the gusto moderno for the disuse\r\nof drums and trumpets, and for the simple old modulations to which\r\nhe confines himself as being ignorant of the new lights. He allowed\r\nWolfgang to study his works; and the latter copied neatly nine movements\r\nof the thirty canons of the \"Stabat Mater.\" (Anh. 238 K.) Not satisfied\r\nwith this, Wolfgang aimed at himself becoming a master of counterpoint.\r\nA \"Kyrie a cinque con diversi canoni\" in three five-part canons in\r\nunison was evidently an imitation of Ligniville's compositions, and\r\nwas only one of many studies in the same difficult art.[27] A loose sheet\r\ncontains besides the first canon of the Kyrie, a design for a four-part\r\ncanon, and five close canons or riddle canons, the first part and the\r\nnumber of parts only being given, [See Page Image] expressly noted di\r\nMozart:--\r\n\r\n{STUDIES IN CANON-WRITING, 1770.}\r\n\r\n(117)\r\n\r\n2.

[28] He had\r\nmade Wolfgang a present of his book, and the latter probably set to work\r\nat once to find out the knack of writing canons. We can see the ease\r\nwith which he mastered his task.\r\n\r\nAt Florence, they fell in with their old London acquaintance Manzuoli,\r\nand Wolfgang was rejoiced to hear that there was a probability of his\r\nbeing engaged to sing in his opera at Milan.\r\n\r\nIn order to incite Manzuoli's ardour, Wolfgang gave him all his songs to\r\nsing, including those he had composed in Milan.\r\n\r\nAt Florence, too, Wolfgang formed a tender friendship with Thomas\r\nLinley, a boy of fourteen, the son of an English composer; he was a\r\npupil of the celebrated violin-player Nardini, and played so exquisitely\r\nas almost to surpass his teacher. The two boys met at the house of\r\nSignora Maddalena Morelli, who was famous as an improvisatrice, under\r\nthe name of Corilla,[29] and had been crowned as a poetess on the\r\ncapitol in 1776;[30] during the\r\n\r\n{ROME, 1770--ALLEGRI'S MISERERE.}\r\n\r\n(119)\r\n\r\nfew days that the Mozarts stayed in Florence the boys were inseparable,\r\nand performed together or by turns, \"more like men than boys.\" They\r\nparted with many tears, and Tommasino, as Linley was called in Italy,\r\nbrought to Wolfgang, as a parting gift, a poem which Corilla had written\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nAccording to Burney,[31] Tommasino and little Mozart were talked of\r\nthroughout Italy as two geniuses of the greatest promise, and in later\r\nlife at Vienna, Mozart spoke with warmth of Linley,[32] and the hopes\r\nwhich had been frustrated by his early death.[33]\r\n\r\nIt was with regret that they left Florence; Leopold Mozart wrote to his\r\nwife: \"I wish that you could see Florence, its neighbourhood, and the\r\nsituation of the city; I am sure you would say that it is a place to\r\nlive and die in.\" But time pressed, if they were to be in Rome for the\r\ncarnival.\r\n\r\nThey had a fatiguing journey, in dreadful weather, that reminded them\r\nof Salzburg rather than of Rome, and passed through uncultivated country\r\nwith wretched inns containing plenty of filth but little to eat, except\r\nperhaps a couple of eggs and some cabbage. They arrived in Rome\r\nabout midday on Wednesday in Holy Week, amidst a storm of thunder and\r\nlightning, \"received like grand people with a discharge of artillery.\"\r\nThere was just time to hurry to the Sistine Chapel and hear Allegri's\r\nMiserere. It was here that Wolfgang accomplished his celebrated feat of\r\nmusical ear and memory.[34]\r\n\r\nIt was the custom on Wednesday and Friday in Holy Week for the choir\r\nof the Pope's household to sing the Miserere (Ps. 50), composed by Dom.\r\nAllegri, which was arranged alternately for a four and five-part chorus,\r\nhaving a final\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(120)\r\n\r\nchorus in nine parts.[35] This performance was universally considered\r\nas one of the most wonderful in Rome; the impression made by it in\r\nconjunction with the solemn rites it accompanied was always described\r\nas overpowering.[36] \"You know,\" writes L. Mozart, \"that this celebrated\r\nMiserere is so jealously guarded, that members of the chapel are\r\nforbidden, under pain of excommunication, to take their parts out of\r\nthe chapel, or to copy or allow it to be copied.[37] We have got it,\r\nnotwithstanding. Wolfgang has written it down, and I should have sent\r\nit to Salzburg in this letter, were not our presence necessary for\r\nits production. More depends on the performance than even on the\r\ncomposition.[38] Besides, we must not let our secret fall into other\r\nhands, _ut non incurramus mediate vel immediate in censuram ecclesiæ_.\"\r\nWhen the performance was repeated on Good Friday, Wolfgang took\r\nhis manuscript with him into the chapel, and holding it in his hat,\r\ncorrected some passages where his memory had not been quite true. The\r\naffair became known, and naturally made a great sensation; Wolfgang\r\nwas called upon to execute the Miserere in presence of the Papal singer\r\nChristofori, who was amazed at its correctness. L. Mozart's news excited\r\nconsternation in Salzburg, mother and daughter believing that Wolfgang\r\nhad sinned in transcribing the Miserere, and fearing unpleasant\r\nconsequences if it should become known. \"When we read your ideas about\r\nthe\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S RECEPTION IN ROME.}\r\n\r\n(121)\r\n\r\nMiserere,\" answered the father, \"we both laughed loud and long. You need\r\nnot be in the least afraid. It is taken in quite another way. All Rome,\r\nand the Pope himself, know that Wolfgang has written the Miserere, and\r\ninstead of punishment it has brought him honour. You must not fail to\r\nshow my letter everywhere, and let his Grace the Archbishop know of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mozarts prepared at once to take part in all the festivities of Holy\r\nand Easter weeks. \"Our handsome dress,\" writes L. Mozart, \"our German\r\nspeech, and the want of ceremony with which I call to our servant to\r\norder the Swiss guard to make way for us, help us through everywhere.\"\r\nHe appears to have been flattered that Wolfgang was sometimes taken for\r\na German nobleman or prince, and he for his tutor. At the cardinals'\r\ntable Wolfgang stood near the seat of Cardinal Pallavicini, who asked\r\nhim his name. On hearing it he inquired in surprise, \"What! are you the\r\nfamous boy of whom I have heard so much?\" talked to him kindly, praised\r\nhis Italian, and spoke broken German to him.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the Easter festivities they set to work to present\r\ntheir numerous letters of introduction, and were warmly received by the\r\nnoble families of Chigi, Barberini, Bracciano, Altemps, and others: one\r\nassembly followed another, all in Wolfgang's honour. The astonishment\r\nat his performances increased, according to L. Mozart, the farther\r\nthey proceeded into Italy; \"but Wolfgang,\" he adds, \"does not remain\r\nstationary; his acquirements increase day by day, so that the greatest\r\nmasters and connoisseurs cannot find words for their astonishment.\" For\r\nthe Academies he appears to have written a Symphony (81, K.) and two\r\nsoprano songs (82, 83, K.)from Metastasio's \"Demo-foonte,\"[39] \"Se ardire\r\ne speranfca\" and \"Se tutti i mali miei.\" In the midst of more serious\r\nstudy he found time to send his sister a new country dance, in return\r\nfor which she was to send him some new minuets by Haydn. About this time\r\nthey fell in with Meissner, who was on his way from Naples to Salzburg;\r\nWolfgang appeared with him at the German Jesuit College, where Herr v.\r\nMölk, of Salzburg, was studying.\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(122)\r\n\r\nOn May 8, they quitted Rome, where their stay had been in every way\r\nagreeable; they had been comfortably lodged in the house of the Papal\r\ncourier Uslinghi, on the Piazza del Clementino; their hostess and her\r\ndaughter treated them with every attention and kindness, making them\r\nfeel quite at home in the house, and refusing to hear of payment when\r\nthey left. The journey to Naples was one not to be undertaken without\r\nsome apprehension. The roads were unsafe, a merchant had lately been\r\nassassinated, and \"sbirri and bloodthirsty Papal soldiers\" were in\r\npursuit of the murderer; L. Mozart hoped that similar measures would\r\nbe taken in Naples. He thought it well, therefore, to travel with four\r\nAugustine monks, which was further an advantage, as it assured them a\r\nfriendly welcome and hospitality in all the monasteries which lay on\r\ntheir way. In Capua, they were allowed to be present as guests at the\r\ntaking of the veil by a nun of high rank.\r\n\r\nNaples, where they remained from the middle of May to the middle of\r\nJune, impressed our travellers with the irresistible charm of beautiful\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAt first they suffered from cold, but this soon turned to excessive\r\nheat, and Wolfgang, who had always longed to look brown, saw his wish\r\nin a fair way to be accomplished. They had good recommendations to the\r\ncourt from Vienna. Queen Caroline, whom Wolfgang had lately seen in\r\nVienna, received them graciously, accosting them whenever they met;\r\nbut Wolfgang was not summoned to play at court. The King, although not\r\nunmusical, cared for nothing that required any cultivation; \"what\r\nhe is,\" writes L. Mozart, \"can be better told than written.\" The\r\nall-powerful minister Tanucci, placed his major-domo at their service,\r\nto show them all that was worth seeing. Other nobles followed this\r\nexample; and every evening a magnificent equipage was placed at their\r\nservice, in which they joined the brilliant _passeggio_ of the nobility\r\non the Strada Nuova or on the quay, clad in elegant summer costumes. L.\r\nMozart had ordered for himself a coat of maroon-coloured watered silk\r\nwith sky blue velvet facings, and Wolfgang rejoiced in an apple-green\r\ncoat with rose-coloured facings and silver\r\n\r\n{NAPLES, 1770--LADY HAMILTON.}\r\n\r\n(123)\r\n\r\nbuttons. Among Wolfgang's patrons was the old Princess Belmonte, the\r\nfriend of Metastasio, and interesting to musicians as having been roused\r\nfrom deep melancholy by the singing of the tenor Raff.\r\n\r\nThe rendezvous of artists and scholars was the house of the British\r\nambassador, Sir Wm. Hamilton, whose acquaintance the Mozarts had made in\r\nLondon. He himself was a violin-player, and pupil of Giardini; and his\r\ncharming first wife was not only a cultivated judge of music, but was\r\nconsidered the best pianoforte-player in Naples; her \"brilliant shakes\r\nand turns\" were not less admired than the touching expression of her\r\nplaying, which was in accord with her gentle nature.[40] It was not\r\nwithout triumph that L. Mozart narrated her having trembled at playing\r\nbefore Wolfgang.\r\n\r\nThey found other old friends in the Swiss Tschudi, from Salzburg, and in\r\na Dutchman named Doncker, who had been kind to them in Amsterdam; every\r\none pressed forward to offer hospitality and assistance. Under these\r\nfavourable circumstances, a public concert was given on May 28, with\r\nthe most brilliant success; a success the more welcome, as they were\r\nnot likely to find their tour a profitable one for some time to come.\r\nL. Mozart was delighted with the situation, fertility, animation, and\r\ncuriosity of Naples; but he was shocked by the wretchedness of the\r\npopulation, and above all by the superstition which prevailed not\r\nonly among the lazaroni, but also in the higher ranks of society. He\r\nwitnessed an example of it when Wolfgang played at the Conservatorio\r\ndella Pietà; the skill with which he used his left hand suggested to the\r\naudience that there was magic in a ring he wore; when he drew it off and\r\nplayed without it the wonder and applause were redoubled.\r\n\r\nThe time of their stay in Naples was favourable to musical interests.\r\nSimultaneously with the excellent representations of comic opera in the\r\nTeatro Nuovo, there was opened on May 30, the King's fête-day, the Grand\r\nOpera in San Carlo,\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(124)\r\n\r\nfor which Jomelli, Caffaro, and Ciccio di Majo were engaged; Anna de\r\nAmicis was prima donna, Aprile principal male singer. By a curious\r\ncoincidence, Wolfgang was a witness of the first attempt made by\r\nJomelli, who had left Stuttgart for Naples in 1768, to regain the favour\r\nof his countrymen. De Rogatis' opera \"Armida Abbandonata,\" in which\r\nhe made his reappearance, was designed to satisfy the higher claims\r\nof dramatic music, and to bring the results of his studies in Germany\r\nbefore the Italians, who were, however, slow to appreciate them.\r\nWolfgang thought the opera fine, but too pedantic and old-fashioned for\r\nthe theatre. This seems to have been the universal opinion; and later\r\nthe increasing distaste to Jomelli's operas obliged the withdrawal\r\nof his \"Iphigenia in Aulide,\" and the substitution of \"Demofoonte\"\r\n(November 4, 1770).[41]\r\n\r\nThe Mozarts found Jomelli polite and friendly. Through him they\r\nbecame acquainted with the impresario Amadori, who offered Wolfgang a\r\n_libretto_ for San Carlo; but this, owing to his previous engagement in\r\nMilan, he was obliged to refuse, together with similar offers which had\r\nbeen made to him in Bologna and Rome.\r\n\r\nOn June 25, they travelled with post-horses back to Rome. Through the\r\nfault of a clumsy postilion their carriage was upset; Leopold saved\r\nhis son by springing out before the danger came; he himself sustained\r\nconsiderable injury to his leg. Wolfgang was so tired by the journey\r\n(they had driven twenty-seven hours without a stop), that after he had\r\neaten a little he fell asleep in his chair and was undressed and put to\r\nbed by his father, without waking.\r\n\r\nThis stay in Rome, during which they were present at the illumination\r\nof St. Peter's, at the delivery of Neapolitan tribute, and other\r\nceremonies, brought Wolfgang a new distinction; he was invested by the\r\nPope, in an\r\n\r\n{\"RITTER MOZART\"--BOLOGNA, 1770.}\r\n\r\n(125)\r\n\r\naudience of July 8, with the order of the Golden Spur, which the father\r\nannounces, not without pride, as \"a piece of good luck.\"[42] \"You\r\nmay imagine how I laugh,\" he writes, \"to hear him called _Signor\r\nCavaliere_.\"\r\n\r\nThe honour apparently made little impression on Wolfgang. For some years\r\nhis father insisted on his signing his compositions \"Del Sign. Cavaliere\r\nW. A. Mozart,\" and advised him to wear his order in Paris; but later he\r\nlet it drop, and one never hears of _Ritter Mozart_, whereas Gluck,\r\nwho like Klopstock, wished to be outwardly recognised as the prophet of\r\nhigher culture, was very tenacious of his dignity as a _Ritter_. Mozart\r\nwas too simple-natured, and too essentially a musician, to set any store\r\nby outward distinctions.\r\n\r\nOn July 10, they left Rome, where Pomp. Battoni had painted a\r\nfine portrait of the young maestro, and travelled by way of Cività\r\nCastellana, Loretto, and Sini-gaglia to Bologna. They arrived on July\r\n20, intending to remain here quietly until the completion and rehearsal\r\nof his opera should render Wolfgang's presence in Milan indispensable.\r\nL. Mozart's injured leg was still troublesome, and he was otherwise\r\nunwell, so that the friendly invitation of Count Pallavicini, to pass\r\nthe hot season at his country-house in the neighbourhood of Bologna, was\r\njoyfully accepted. They found the coolest, best-appointed rooms prepared\r\nfor them; couriers and servants were placed at their disposal, and their\r\nintercourse with the noble family was pleasant and unrestrained.\r\nThe father was most carefully tended, and Wolfgang struck up a firm\r\nfriendship with the young Count, who was just his own age, played\r\nthe piano, spoke three languages, had six tutors, and was already a\r\nchamberlain.\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(126)\r\n\r\nWolfgang composed industriously, and writes to his sister about four\r\nItalian symphonies, five or six songs, and a motett, which he had\r\nwritten. His only distress was that he had lost his singing voice; he\r\nhad not five clear notes left, either high or low, and could no longer\r\nsing his own compositions. At Bologna they made the acquaintance of the\r\noperatic composer, Joh. Misliweczeck (1737-1781), who was finishing an\r\noratorio for Padua, and was to write the opera in Milan for 1772. \"He\r\nis an honest man,\" writes L. Mozart, \"and we have become great friends.\"\r\nBut their principal intercourse was with Padre Martini, with whom they\r\nbecame very intimate, visiting him daily, and holding long musical\r\ndiscussions. The discourse and instruction of the great contrapuntist\r\ncould not be without influence on Wolfgang's work. A list of sketches in\r\ndifficult contrapuntal forms, which according to the handwriting belong\r\nto this time, must have been studies suggested by Padre Martini. Of\r\npeculiar interest is a three-part Miserere for alto, tenor, and bass,\r\nwith figured Continuo, superscribed _Del Sigr. Caval. W. A. Mozart, in\r\nBologna_, 1770 (85 K.). It is evidently written under the influence of\r\nAllegri's Roman Miserere, generally harmonic, with some few imitative\r\nintroductory passages, simple and very beautiful. The three last\r\nmovements, Quoniam, Benigne, Tunc acceptabis, are written by another\r\nhand, and evidently not composed by Mozart; the subjects are severer and\r\nmore simple. Probably Padre Martini wound up the youth's exercises by\r\nthese movements of his own composition.[43]\r\n\r\nThe Philharmonic Society of Naples, whose festival performance Mozart\r\nhad attended in company with Burney,[44]\r\n\r\n{ELECTION TO THE ÀCCÀDEMIA FILARMONICA.}\r\n\r\n(127)\r\n\r\nhonoured him with a signal proof of admiration and esteem. This famous\r\nsociety, founded in 1666, upon the presentation by Wolfgang of a\r\nmemorial, and his accomplishment of a prescribed task, elected him a\r\nmember of their body as _Com-positore_. This honour was eagerly sought\r\nafter by the most distinguished composers. For composers of church music\r\nit was important, since Benedict XIV., in a bull of 1749, had given a\r\nkind of overseership to the Philharmonic Society; only its members could\r\nbecome kapellmeisters to churches in Bologna, and by a Papal decree this\r\nmembership was allowed to take the place of any examination.[45] The\r\ndistinction was the greater since members were required[46] to be twenty\r\nyears old, to have been admitted into the first class of compositore,\r\nand to have been a year in the second class of cantori and sonatori.\r\nLeopold describes the election as follows:--\r\n\r\nAt 4 o'clock in the afternoon of October 9 Wolfgang was required to\r\nappear at the hall of the society. There the Princeps Academiæ and the\r\ntwo censors (who are old kapellmeisters) gave him an antiphon from\r\nthe Antiphonary; he was then conducted by the verger to a neighbouring\r\napartment and locked in, there to set it in three parts. When it was\r\nready it was examined by the censor, and all the kapellmeistem and\r\ncomposers, who voted on it by means of black and white balls. All the\r\nballs being white he was called in, and amid clapping of hands and\r\ncongratulations the Princeps Academiæ in the name of the society\r\nannounced his election. He returned thanks, and the thing was over.\r\nI was all the time on the other side of the hall cooped up in the\r\nAcademical Library. Every one was astonished that he was ready so\r\nsoon, for many have spent three hours over an antiphon of three lines.\r\nN.B.--You must know that it was not an easy task, for this kind of\r\ncomposition excludes many things of which he had been told beforehand.\r\nHe finished it in exactly half an hour.\r\n\r\nThe task was, according to the old statute, a Cantus firmus from the\r\nGregorian Antiphonary, to be elaborated contrapuntally for four, five,\r\nor eight voices _a capella_ (in duple time); it was to be executed\r\nstrictly according to rule, adhering to the singular treatment of the\r\nharmonies belonging to the old\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(128)\r\n\r\nstyle of church music. After 1773, the examination became more\r\nsevere,[47] and an Italian who stood the test at the beginning of this\r\ncentury, speaks of it as consisting of three separate compositions.\r\nFirst, the given subject was to be arranged for four voices in\r\n_falsobordone_, i.e., in plain harmonics, after the fashion of our\r\ncongregational chorales. The second test consisted of a _disposizione di\r\nparte_. One voice retained the Cantus firmus, the others were to be set\r\nto it in canonic or imitative mode. The motifs were often taken from the\r\nCantus firmus itself, in a rhythmical, diminished form. Strict imitation\r\nwas not enjoined; it sufficed that the voices should follow each other\r\nwith similar passages. The third task was a _fuga reale_, a perfect\r\nfugue, according to the rules of the church mode of the Cantus firmus,\r\nin which one phrase is carried through as a theme, the other parts\r\nserving as intermediate phrases.\r\n\r\nWolfgang did not go through this examination without preparation. An\r\nelaboration in his boyish handwriting of the Cantus firmus \"Cibavit eos\r\nin adipe\" (44 K.) is probably an exercise made under Padre Martini's\r\ndirections. His trial work was a Cantus firmus from the Roman\r\nAntiphonary, a freely imitative contrapuntal arrangement of the\r\naccompanying parts overlying the Cantus firmus of the bass, which is\r\nonly to be adhered to in its melodic progressions, and may be modified\r\nin its rhythmical divisions. The original from Mozart's hand is in the\r\narchives of the Philharmonic Society, where it was found by Gaspari in a\r\nvolume of various test works chiefly by Martini's pupils.[48] Next to it\r\namong the documents was a second elaboration written by Padre Martini,\r\nand copied by Wolfgang. Of this a second copy is in the Mozarteum, from\r\nWolfgang's hand, with his father's subscription: _Dal Sigr. Cavaliere\r\nAmadeo Wolfgango Mozart di Salisburgo, Scritto nella sala dell'\r\naccademia filarmonica in Bologna li 10 d' Ottobre, 1770_. This was\r\npublished as Wolfgang's own test work (86 K.).[49] Probably Padre\r\nMartini went\r\n\r\n{MILAN--\"MITRIDATE.\"}\r\n\r\n(129)\r\n\r\nthrough the boy's work, which was not free from faults, and was entered\r\nin the protocol as \"satisfying the conditions,\" and showed him how\r\nthe task might have been executed; he took the copy of the corrected\r\nexercise to Salzburg when he returned there.\r\n\r\nOn October 18 they arrived at Milan, and set vigorously to work on\r\nthe completion of the opera. The subject chosen was \"Mitridate, Re\r\ndi Ponto,\" opera seria in three acts, versified by Vittorio Amadeo\r\nCigna-Santi of Turin, where it had already been produced in 1767 with\r\nthe music of the kapellmeister Quirico Gasparini. It was first necessary\r\nto finish the recitatives begun in Bologna, and Wolfgang worked so hard\r\nat them that he excused himself to his mother for not writing: \"His\r\nfingers ached so from writing recitatives.\" Every air in the opera was\r\nwritten after consultation with the singers, male and female, as to what\r\nwas best suited to their voice and style. By studying the taste of\r\nthe vocalists and so engaging their zeal, the composer found the best\r\nsecurity for the favourable reception of his work. If he were not\r\nfortunate enough to please his singers, either the whole must be\r\nrewritten to suit them, or he must be prepared to hear his music fall\r\nflat before the audience, if indeed something quite different were not\r\nsubstituted by the performer. When the composer possessed true talent\r\nand judgment, this co-operation was less detrimental to the work than\r\nif it had been left altogether to the discretion of the performers;\r\nnevertheless, the danger of undignified subjection to their caprices was\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nWolfgang strove to extricate himself, as best he might, from the\r\ndifficulties and intrigues which hindered his work. These were the more\r\nvexatious, as the singers arrived in Milan so late as to give him little\r\ntime for composition. His father was careful not to allow him to overtax\r\nhis strength, and especially insisted on his not working immediately\r\nafter eating, unless under the pressure of great necessity; they usually\r\nwent for a walk first. The mental strain of so important a task had\r\na sobering effect on the boy's spirits, and he repeatedly enjoins his\r\nmother and sister to pray for the success of the opera, \"so that we may\r\nall live happily\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(130)\r\n\r\ntogether again.\" Leopold begs his friends in Salzburg to be charitable\r\nenough to write them cheerful, jocular letters, to distract Wolfgang's\r\nmind, There was, of course, the usual petty spite of the \"Virtuosen\r\ncanaille\" to combat; they were not likely to leave unmolested a\r\nkapellmeister at once \"a youth and a foreigner\"; but the father shrank\r\nfrom no difficulties which could be overcome by \"presence of mind and\r\ngood sense,\" and declared they would gnaw through them all, \"as the\r\nHanswurst did through the Dreckberg.\"\r\n\r\nThe prima donna was not Gabrielli, but Antonia Bernasconi, daughter of\r\na valet of the Duke of Wurtemberg, who had been educated as a singer\r\nby her stepfather, Andrea Bernasconi (kapellmeister at Munich since\r\n1754).[50] With her was \"the first battle to fight,\" for it was through\r\nher that the envious cabal sought to overthrow the young composer. An\r\nunknown opponent of Wolfgang tried to persuade her to reject the songs\r\nand duets which he had composed for her, and to substitute those\r\nof Gasparini. But Bernasconi withstood this infamous proposal. She\r\ndeclared, on the contrary, that she was \"beside herself with joy\" at the\r\nsongs which Wolfgang had written \"according to her will and desire\"; and\r\nthe experienced old maestro Lampugnani, who rehearsed her part with\r\nher, was never tired of praising the compositions. Another cloud in the\r\ntheatrical heavens appeared in the person of the tenor, the Cavalier\r\nGuglielmo d' Ettore, who had performed with great success at Munich and\r\nPadua.[51] This storm, too, was happily allayed, but it must have been a\r\nthreatening one, for L. Mozart reminds his son of it later, to encourage\r\nhim, in Paris. The last arrival was the primo uomo--not Manzuoli, but\r\nSantorini, who had lately been singing at Turin, and had known them in\r\nBologna. He was not at Milan till December 1, and the representation was\r\nto take place on the 26th.\r\n\r\nThe rehearsals began under favourable circumstances; even the copyist\r\nhad performed his task so well that he\r\n\r\n{\"MITRIDATE\"--HOPES AND FEARS.}\r\n\r\n(131)\r\n\r\nhad made only one mistake in the recitatives, and the singers proved\r\nexcellent. \"As far as I can judge, without fatherly partiality,\" wrote\r\nL. Mozart on December 8, \"I believe that Wolfgang has written the opera\r\nwell and with spirit.\" On December 17 the first rehearsal with full\r\norchestra[52] took place in the Redoutensaal, and the second two days\r\nlater in the theatre; the verdict was altogether in favour of the new\r\nopera:--\r\n\r\nBefore the first rehearsal with the small orchestra, there were not\r\nwanting people who condemned the music beforehand as youthful and poor;\r\nthey prophesied, as it were, declaring it impossible that so young\r\na boy, and a German to boot, could write an Italian opera;[53] they\r\nacknowledged him to be a great performer, but denied that he could by\r\nany means understand the _chiaro ed oscuro_ needed in the drama. But\r\nsince the first rehearsal these people are all dumbfoundered, and have\r\nnot another word to say. The copyist is delighted, which is a good sign\r\nin Italy, for when the music pleases, the copyist often gains more by\r\ndistributing and selling the songs than the kapellmeister by composing\r\nthem;[54] the singers, male and female, are highly satisfied, and the\r\nduet between the primo uomo and prima donna is especially praised.\"\r\n\r\nThe _professori_ (instrumentalists) in the orchestra were pleased, and\r\ndeclared that the music was clear, distinct, and easy to play. Mozart's\r\nfriends were as cheerful as his detractors were gloomy, and the most\r\nnoted musicians, such as Fioroni, Sammartini, Lampugnani, and Piazza\r\nColombo were decidedly in favour of the opera. Under these circumstances\r\n(although the first opera of the season was usually\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(132)\r\n\r\nthe least esteemed) they could look forward with calmness to the\r\nrepresentation. This took place on December 26, under Wolfgang's\r\nconductorship, and the result surpassed all expectation. Every song,\r\nexcept those of the subordinate personages, was received with deafening\r\napplause, and with the cry \"Evviva il maestro! evviva il maestrino!\"\r\nContrary to all custom at a first representation a song of the prima\r\ndonna's was encored. At the second performance the applause was still\r\ngreater, two songs and a duet being encored; but as it was Thursday, and\r\nthe audience wished to go home to supper before midnight, so as not to\r\nencroach on Friday (fast day) the performance was cut short; it lasted,\r\nhowever, including the ballets at the end of each act, six good hours.\r\nOn January 5, 1771, L. Mozart wrote home to his wife:--\r\n\r\nOur son's opera is received with general approbation, and may be\r\nconsidered, as the Italians say, _dalle stelle_. Since the third\r\nperformance we are alternately in the pit and the boxes, hearing or\r\nseeing, and every one is curious to talk with or look closely at the\r\nSignor Maestro, for the maestro is only bound to conduct the opera three\r\nevenings; Lampugnani accompanied at the second pianoforte, and now that\r\nWolfgang does not play, he takes the first, and Melchior Chiesa the\r\nsecond. If any one had told me fifteen or eighteen years ago, when\r\nI heard so much of the opera songs and symphonies of Lampugnani in\r\nEngland, and Melchior Chiesa in Italy, that these two men would perform\r\nyour son's music, and take his place at the piano to accompany his\r\nopera, I should probably have directed such a person to the madhouse as\r\nan idiot. We see by this how the power of God works in us men when we do\r\nnot bury the talents that He has graciously bestowed on us.\r\n\r\nThe opera was repeated twenty times, and always with growing applause\r\nand a full house. The \"Milan News,\" (January 2, 1771) assures its\r\nreaders, that the youthful composer \"studia il bello della natura e ce\r\nlo rappressenta adomo delle più rare grazie musicali.\" Wolfgang received\r\nfrom the public the appellation of the \"Cavaliere Filarmonico,\" which\r\nwas confirmed by the Accademia Filarmonica at Verona, who elected him as\r\ntheir kapellmeister on January 5, 1771.\r\n\r\nProfessional cares [55]did not engross all Mozart's time and attention. They\r\nbecame on intimate terms with the young\r\n\r\n{VENICE--PADUA--SALZBURG, 1771.}\r\n\r\n(133)\r\n\r\ndifficult concerto at sight. They had a trip to Turin, saw a splendid\r\nopera, and were back in Milan on January 31,[56] leaving again shortly\r\nfor Venice, where they arrived on the Monday in Carnival week. They\r\nwere hospitably received by a merchant, Wider, a business friend of\r\nHagenauer's.\r\n\r\nThey enjoyed in all comfort the pleasures of a Venetian carnival,\r\nand, having introductions to all the nobility, splendidly appointed\r\ngondoliers were always at their service; one invitation followed\r\nanother, and almost every evening was passed at the opera, or at some\r\nother place of amusement. A concert was given by Mozart with brilliant\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nOn the return journey, undertaken on March 13, they stayed one day\r\nin Padua, visiting the musical celebrities Franc. Ant. Ballotti\r\n(1697-1780), one of the first organ-players in Italy, and almost as\r\ngood a theorist and contrapuntist as Padre Martini himself,[57] and the\r\ncomposer and Munich kapellmeister, Giov. Ferrandini[58]--Tartini had\r\ndied the year before. Wolfgang played on the excellent organ in Santa\r\nGiustina. At Padua, too, he received a commission to write an oratorio\r\nto be completed at home as opportunity offered. At Vicenza they remained\r\nsome days at the request of the Bishop, a Cornero, who had made their\r\nacquaintance at Venice; and at Verona they stayed with their old friend\r\nLuggiati, who gave a brilliant reception in Wolfgang's honour.\r\n\r\nOn March 28, 1771, Wolfgang was in Salzburg again, enriched with many\r\nexperiences and loaded with honours, his talents matured and his tastes\r\nimproved; but his nature as simple, modest, and childlike as when he had\r\nset out. The most direct result of the great success of his opera was\r\na commission from the impresario in Milan for the first opera of the\r\nCarnival of 1773, with an increased remuneration of 130 gigliati.\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(134)\r\n\r\nAt Verona, L. Mozart had already heard rumours of a document on its way\r\nfrom Vienna to Salzburg, which was to bring his son \"immortal honour.\"\r\nThey had scarcely arrived in Salzburg, when Count Firmian commissioned\r\nWolfgang, in the name of the Empress Maria Theresa, to compose a\r\ntheatrical serenade or cantata in celebration of the marriage of the\r\nArchduke Ferdinand with the Princess Maria Ricciarda Beatrice, daughter\r\nof the hereditary Prince Ercole Rainaldo, of Modena. As the marriage was\r\nto take place in October of the year 1771, it follows that the stay in\r\nSalzburg was not of long duration. During this interval he composed,\r\nprincipally no doubt to satisfy the demands of his official position, a\r\n\"Litany\" (109 K.), and a \"Regina Coeli\" (108 K.) in May, and a Symphony\r\n(110 K.) in July. Leopold Mozart had little hope that even Wolfgang's\r\nsuccess in Milan would serve to advance his cause with the Archbishop in\r\ncase of any more lucrative post becoming vacant. Such considerations did\r\nnot trouble Wolfgang himself so much as his father; he took advantage\r\nof this interval to fall in love for the first time. His letters to his\r\nsister are full of hints of a nameless beauty, of unspeakable emotions;\r\nand the fact that the young lady married about the same time makes the\r\npicture complete of the first love of a boy of sixteen, which had, as\r\nmight be expected, no lasting effect on his natural good spirits.\r\n\r\nOn August 13 they left Salzburg, and after a short stay in Verona\r\narrived at Milan on August 21. The marriage was fixed for October 15,\r\nbut the libretto had not yet been returned from Vienna, where it had\r\nbeen sent on approbation; in those days it was considered that a maestro\r\nshould be so sure of his art that it should stand him in stead at all\r\ntimes and seasons.[59] Wolfgang was under no apprehension on this score;\r\nhe was delighted with his gracious reception by the royal bride, and\r\nenjoyed the delicious fruit, eating a double share of it, as he says,\r\nout of brotherly love to his\r\n\r\n{MILAN, 1771--GABRIELLI.}\r\n\r\n(135)\r\n\r\nsister. When at last the book arrived at the end of August it was\r\ndetained some days longer by the poet to make the numerous alterations\r\nrequired, and not until the beginning of September was it finally\r\ndelivered over to Wolfgang. Then he set to work, composing so vigorously\r\nthat on September 13 the recitatives and choruses were finished, and\r\nhis father was of opinion that the whole opera with the ballet would be\r\nready in twelve days, which indeed it was; and no wonder that Wolfgang\r\ncomplained that his fingers ached. In the room above that where he wrote\r\nwas a violinist, in the room below another; a singing master lived\r\nnext door, and an oboist opposite. \"It is capital for composing,\" says\r\nWolfgang; \"it gives one new ideas.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this visit to Milan they made the acquaintance of the great\r\nsoprano, Catarina Gabrielli, famed for her intrigues no less than\r\nfor her musical genius. The impression made by her on Wolfgang may\r\nbe gathered from a letter to his father written later from Mannheim\r\n(February 19, 1778):--\r\n\r\nThose who have heard Gabrielli must and will acknowledge that she is a\r\nmere executant; her peculiar style of delivery excites admiration, but\r\nonly for the first three or four times of hearing her. In the long\r\nrun she is not pleasing; one gets tired of passages, and she has the\r\nmisfortune of not being able to sing. She cannot sustain a note in\r\ntune; she has no _messa di voce_; in a word, she sings with art, but no\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse of the Mozarts with their fellow-artists, \"really good\r\nand famous singers, and sensible people,\" was cordial, and undisturbed\r\neither by intrigues or cabals. Wolfgang's assured position with regard\r\nto the public, as well as the favour in which he was held at the\r\nimperial court, doubtless contributed to preserve harmony. The tenor\r\nTibaldi and Manzuoli, who was really engaged this time, came almost\r\ndaily at 11 o'clock, and remained sitting at the table till one;\r\nWolfgang composing all the time.\r\n\r\nBut the most satisfactory connection was that with Hasse, who was\r\ncomposing an opera on Metastasio's \"Ruggiero,\" for the same festive\r\noccasion.[60] It was of no small significance\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(136)\r\n\r\nthat men like Hasse and Metastasio, who had brought Italian opera to its\r\nhighest point, and a famous poet, such as Gius. Parini, in Milan,[61]\r\nshould have been content to place themselves on a level with young\r\nMozart. It was momentous in the history of music, this handing over of\r\nthe sceptre by the man who had ruled the Italian stage throughout his\r\nlong career to the youth, who was not indeed destined to acquire equal\r\nfame living, but to whom posterity was to allot a far more glorious\r\nplace. Hasse himself is said to have exclaimed: \"This boy will throw us\r\nall into the shade.\"[62] It was like him to recognise without envy the\r\nartistic greatness of Mozart; all young artists[63] found him ready to\r\nappreciate and help forward their efforts,[64] and Mozart himself had\r\nbeen grateful for his support when fighting with the musical cabal in\r\nVienna.[65]\r\n\r\nThe festivities[66] which had attracted a crowd of strangers to Milan\r\nbegan with the triumphant entry of the Duke, followed by the marriage\r\nceremony in the cathedral; then came a concert and reception at court.\r\nOn the 16th a public banquet was given to more than four hundred bridal\r\ncouples, to whom the Empress had given dowries, and in the evening\r\nHasse's opera \"Ruggiero\" was performed in the newly decorated theatre,\r\nwith two gorgeous ballets in the _entr'actes_, \"La Corona della gloria,\"\r\nby Pick, and \"Pico e Canente,\" by Favier.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, after a splendid procession on the Corso, Wolfgang's\r\nserenata \"Ascanio in Alba\" (111 K.), an allegorical pastoral play in\r\ntwo acts, with choruses and dances, (by Favier) was produced. After the\r\nfirst rehearsal, L. Mozart had been able to predict to his wife that the\r\nsuccess of the work was assured. \"Because, to begin with,\r\n\r\n{\"ASCANIO IN ALBA.\"}\r\n\r\n(137)\r\n\r\nnot only are Signor Manzuoli and the other vocalists in the highest\r\ndegree pleased with their songs, but they are as anxious as ourselves to\r\nhear the serenata with the full orchestra; secondly, because I know what\r\nhe has written, and the effect it will have, and am quite convinced that\r\nit is excellent, both for the singers and the orchestra.\" He had not\r\ndeceived himself, the applause was extraordinary; the serenata was\r\nrepeated the next day, and until the close of the festivities was more\r\nfrequently given than \"Ruggiero.\" \"I am sorry,\" writes L. Mozart, \"that\r\nWolfgang's serenata should have so entirely eclipsed Hasse's opera.\"\r\n\r\nHe refers his home circle to the judgment of a young Salzburg merchant,\r\nKerschbaumer, \"who, on the 24th, was a witness how the Archduke\r\nand Archduchess not only applauded two of the songs until they were\r\nrepeated, but leaning from their box, both during and after the\r\nperformance, they bowed towards Wolfgang, and testified their approval\r\nby cries of\r\n\r\n'Bravissimo! maestro,' and clapping of hands, an example followed by all\r\npresent.\" This time, too, Wolfgang received more substantial marks of\r\nfavour; besides the stipulated fee, the Empress presented him with a\r\ngold watch set with diamonds, having on its back an admirably executed\r\nminiature of herself in enamel.[67]\r\n\r\nAmong the festivities, which lasted until the end of the month, were a\r\nsplendidly appointed masked procession of _facchini_, in the costume of\r\nthe surrounding peasantry, on the 19th; races for horses (barberi) on\r\nche 27th, for chariots (calessetti) on the 28th, and the _cuccagna_\r\non the 24th, when masses of viands were given up to the plunder of the\r\npeople, and fountains of wine were opened.[68] On this occasion the\r\nMozarts narrowly escaped a great danger. One of the great scaffoldings\r\nerected for spectators fell, and more than fifty persons were killed or\r\ninjured. It was only an accidental delay which had prevented Wolfgang\r\nand his father from taking the seats which had been allotted them on\r\nthis\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(138)\r\n\r\nerection, and had caused them to seat themselves in the court gallery.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the opera, Mozart wrote a symphony (112 K.) and a\r\ndivertimento (113 K.), probably for a concert, but at all events to\r\norder. During this stay in Milan a contract was entered into with the\r\ntheatre of S. Benedetto in Venice, by which Wolfgang was commissioned to\r\nwrite the second opera of the Carnival of 1773. How this was possible,\r\nsince the contract stipulates for residence in Venice at the same time\r\nas it had been already promised in Milan, it is not easy to see, unless\r\nsome indulgence on the part of the Venetian impresario was looked for,\r\nperhaps even promised.[69] The contract, however, was never fulfilled;\r\nNau-mann became Mozart's substitute, arriving in Vienna just in time\r\nto undertake the opera. He produced his \"Soliman\" with very remarkable\r\nsuccess.[70]\r\n\r\nThe return of the Mozarts to Salzburg was delayed until the middle of\r\nDecember, on the 30th of which month Wolfgang composed a symphony (114\r\nK,), and was soon after seized with severe illness.[71]\r\n\r\nTheir arrival at home coincided with the death of Archbishop Sigismund,\r\nwhich took place after a lingering illness on December 16,1771. His\r\nsuccessor was elected on March 14, 1772, in the person of Hieronymus\r\nJoseph Franz v. Paula, Count of Colloredo, Bishop of Gurk; to the\r\nuniversal surprise and grief of the populace, who had little prosperity\r\nto hope for under his rule.[72] An opera was required to form\r\n\r\n{\"IL SOGNO DI SCIPIONE\"--SALZBURG, 1772.}\r\n\r\n(139)\r\n\r\npart of the festivities accompanying his installation, and this Wolfgang\r\nwas commissioned to compose.[73] The subject chosen was \"Il Sogno di\r\nScipione\" (126 K.), an allegorical _azione teatrale_, by Metastasio,\r\nwhich had been performed with music by Predieri on the birthday of the\r\nEmpress Elizabeth, October 1, 1735. It was written with reference to the\r\nunfortunate military events in Italy, and stress was laid on the bravery\r\nand steadfastness of a great general, even in defeat. How far this\r\nsubject was applicable to the circumstances of Bishop Hieronymus does\r\nnot seem to have been inquired; even the words of the Licenza were left\r\nunaltered, except that the name of Girolamo was substituted for Carlo.\r\nIt is amusing to note that Mozart composing from his Metastasio, writes\r\nthe words under his score: \"Ma Scipio esalta il labbro e _Carlo_ il\r\ncuore,\" then effaces the name and writes _Girolamo_.\r\n\r\nWe do not know how far indifference towards the person of the new\r\nArchbishop is responsible for the fact that this opera betrays more of\r\nthe character of an occasional piece written to order than any other\r\ncomposition by Mozart. It was probably produced in the beginning of May,\r\n1772.[74]\r\n\r\nThe remaining compositions which fall authentically within this period\r\nare a symphony (124 K.), composed on February 21, and a litany, \"De\r\nVenerabile\" a very important work (125 K.), in March. January was lost\r\nby illness, and in April, Mozart was busy with his opera; but in May, a\r\n\"Regina Coeli\" (127 K.) and no fewer than three symphonies (128-130 K.)\r\nwere ready; in June, a great divertimento (131 K); in July and August\r\nthree more symphonies (132-135 K.); three quartets, or divertimenti\r\n(136-138 K.), fall also within the year 1772. These clearly identified\r\ncompositions can scarcely be all that belong to this period. If the fact\r\nsurprises us that Mozart, instead of\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(140)\r\n\r\nmaking studies for the new opera which he was to produce in the autumn,\r\nemployed this interval almost entirely on church and instrumental music,\r\nwe must look for an explanation of it in his position at Salzburg, from\r\nwhich we cannot doubt that he felt an intense longing to free himself.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of Burney who was at Salzburg in the summer of 1772\r\ninforms him that he has visited Mozart the father, and heard Wolfgang\r\nand his sister play duets together; Wolfgang, he says, is undoubtedly\r\na master of his instrument, but he appears to have reached his climax,\r\nand, judging from his orchestral music, he affords another proof\r\nthat premature fruits are more rare than excellent.[75] It would be\r\nunreasonable to take this false prophecy amiss, for it no doubt reflects\r\nsomething of the state of opinion in Salzburg at the time.\r\n\r\nOn October 24 they set forth once more on the journey to Milan, in order\r\nto be there in good time for the new opera. On the way, \"to make time\r\npass,\" Wolfgang composed a pianoforte duet; his fête-day was merrily\r\nkept with the brothers Piccini, in Ala (October 31); and after the usual\r\nstay with Luggiati in Verona, they arrived at Milan on November 4. L.\r\nMozart, who had lately been very well, appeared to profit by the change\r\nand irregularity of a travelling life, but at Milan the old complaint\r\nreappeared. Giddiness and numbness in the head, attributable to a bad\r\nfall, seized him more especially when he had been composing, and he\r\ncould not free himself from \"Salzburg thoughts,\" in which he would be\r\nunconsciously plunged for some time, and only with an effort banish them\r\nfrom his mind \"like the wicked thoughts with which the devil used to\r\ntempt him in his youth.\" They were no doubt the reflection of his almost\r\nunendurable relations with the new Archbishop. He foresaw a troubled\r\nfuture, unless he could succeed in extricating Wolfgang from his\r\nundefined position in Salzburg, and placing him on a secure footing; and\r\nto this end he bent all his endeavours.\r\n\r\nThe opera which Wolfgang was to compose was \"Lucio\r\n\r\n{\"LUCIO SILLA\"--MILAN, 1772.}\r\n\r\n(141)\r\n\r\nSilla,\" the words by Giovanni da Camera, a poet of Milan. This time\r\nWolfgang brought part of the recitative with him, but he did not gain\r\nby so doing; for the poet had in the meantime submitted his text to\r\nMetastasio, who made many alterations, and added a new scene.\r\n\r\nHe had plenty of time, however, to rewrite the recitatives and to\r\ncompose the choruses and the overtures, for of the singers only Signora\r\nFélicita Suarti (who sang in Parma in 1769, and now took the part of\r\nsecondo uomo), and the ultimo tenore had appeared. They found Milan very\r\nempty, every one still in the country; only the D'Aste family received\r\nthem into the same intimacy as before.\r\n\r\nNext arrived the primo uomo Venanzio Rauzzini (b. 1752), an excellent\r\nsinger, an accomplished pianist, and a not inconsiderable composer. He\r\nhad been in Munich since 1776, when Burney made his acquaintance, and\r\nlearned that he was to sing in Mozart's opera.[76] His first song\r\nwas soon ready; L. Mozart thought it incomparably beautiful, and that\r\nRauzzini sang it \"like an angel.\"[77] At last the prima donna De Amicis\r\narrived, after a tedious journey from Venice. It was time, for the\r\nrepresentation was fixed for the 26th December, and there were still\r\nfourteen pieces to be composed, among them the terzet and the duet,\r\n\"which might be reckoned as four.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot possibly write you a long letter,\" wrote Wolfgang on the 5th\r\nDecember, \"for I have nothing to say, and do not know what I am writing;\r\nmy thoughts are always in my opera, and I am in danger of writing you a\r\nwhole song instead of words.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Anna de Amicis (born about 1740), a pupil of Tesi, had been\r\nbrought from the opera buffa as prima donna to the opera seria by Chr.\r\nBach in London (1762). She had been married five years to Buonsolazzi,\r\nan official in Naples,\r\n\r\n{THE ITALIAN TOUR.}\r\n\r\n(142)\r\n\r\nand she brought her little daughter Sepperl with her to Milan.[78]\r\nAlthough the Mozarts had made her acquaintance during their Parisian\r\ntour, she was at first a little inclined to create difficulties; but the\r\nmost friendly relations were soon established between them.\r\n\r\nWhen she had mastered her three songs she was \"in high delight, because\r\nWolfgang had suited her so wonderfully well.\" He had furnished the\r\nprincipal song with some new and marvellously difficult passages.[79] L.\r\nMozart wrote after the rehearsals, that she both sang and acted like an\r\nangel, and all Salzburg would be amazed to hear her.\r\n\r\nThere was still wanting the tenor Cardoni, and news at length arrived\r\nthat he was so seriously ill he could not appear. Suitable messengers\r\nwere at once despatched to Turin and Bologna, to seek for another good\r\ntenor, who was to be not only a good singer, \"but especially a good\r\nactor, and a person of presence, to represent Lucio Silla with proper\r\ndignity.\" But such an one was not to be procured, and there was nothing\r\nfor it at last but to take a church singer from Lodi, Bassano Morgnoni,\r\nwho had occasionally sung in the theatre there, but never on a larger\r\nstage. He arrived on December 17, when the rehearsals were going on, and\r\nthe following day Wolfgang wrote two of the four songs allotted to him.\r\nOn December 21, 22, and 23 there were large parties of the nobility at\r\nCount Firmian's, at which vocal and instrumental music was performed\r\nfrom five o'clock in the evening until eleven. Wolfgang played each\r\ntime, and was favourably noticed by all the great people.\r\n\r\nThe grand rehearsal passed off well; and the first representation on\r\nDecember 26, in spite of some drawbacks, was a great success. The opera\r\nbegan, according to custom, an hour after Ave Maria, and at half-past\r\nfive the theatre was\r\n\r\n{PERFORMANCE OF \"LUCIO SILLA.\"}\r\n\r\n(143)\r\n\r\nquite full. Just before Ave Maria the Archduke had risen from table, and\r\nretired to despatch five autograph congratulations on the New Year to\r\nVienna; as might be expected, this took some time. The performers, male\r\nand female, in all the agitation of a first performance, and the hot\r\nimpatient public were obliged to wait the arrival of the court until\r\npast eight o'clock. Unhappily the Lodi tenor had to express his anger by\r\ngestures during the prima donna's first song; in his efforts to surpass\r\nhimself he gesticulated so wildly, \"that he appeared to wish to box her\r\nears, or hit her in the face with his clenched fist.\" Thereupon a laugh\r\nbroke out; this confused De Amicis, who did not know for whom it was\r\nintended, and she sang ill the whole evening, especially after Rauzzini\r\nhad been received on his first entry with applause from the Archduchess.\r\nRauzzini had contrived to inform the Archduchess that he should be\r\nnervous at singing before her, and so had assured himself of the\r\napplause of the court. De Amicis was consoled by an invitation to court\r\nthe next day, and then the opera went altogether well.\r\n\r\nIt was given more than twenty times to houses so full \"that one\r\ncould scarcely squeeze in.\" Each time some of the songs were encored,\r\ngenerally the prima donna's, which had \"the upper hand.\"[80]\r\n\r\nWolfgang wrote a motett, \"Exultate,\" for Rauzzini, (165 K.), which was\r\nperformed before the actors on January, 1773. It is on the plan of a\r\ngreat dramatic scene, and maintains that style throughout. To a long and\r\nelaborate allegro succeeds a short recitative leading to a long, simple\r\nslow movement. The finale is an animated \"Alleluia,\" cheerful and\r\nbrilliant. Later (February 6) his father says he is busy with a quartet.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart continually postponed their departure, at first with the\r\nexpectation of seeing the second opera, which was much later than usual,\r\nowing to the many representations of \"Lucio Silla,\" and afterwards under\r\nthe pretext of an attack\r\n\r\n{WORKS IN GERMANY.}\r\n\r\n(144)\r\n\r\nof rheumatism, which confined him to bed. In point of fact he had, with\r\nthe powerful support of Count Firmian, proferred a request to the Grand\r\nDuke Leopold at Florence that the latter would attach Wolfgang to his\r\ncourt. The Grand Duke at first showed gracious dispositions, and L.\r\nMozart must have wished to continue the negotiations from Milan. Even\r\nafter their ultimate failure he thought he might count on powerful\r\nrecommendations from Florence, and his thoughts turned again on a great\r\nprofessional tour. \"Only be economical,\" he wrote, \"for we must have\r\nmoney if we are to undertake a tour; I grudge every penny spent in\r\nSalzburg.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the close of their stay a colleague from the Salzburg chapel,\r\nthe horn-player Leutgeb, came to Milan, and was well received there.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of March they really set out; for they might not be\r\nabsent from their places on the anniversary of the Archbishop's election\r\n(March 14).\r\n\r\nThe remarkable success of the opera, and the lively interest excited by\r\nWolfgang's person, leaves scarcely any doubt that further overtures were\r\nmade to him in Italy; their non-acceptance must have been owing to the\r\nArchbishop's refusal of an extended leave of absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A.

WORKS IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\nAT Salzburg during May, 1773, Wolfgang composed a symphony (181 K.), a\r\nconcertone for two violins (190 K.), and a mass (167 K.) in June.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of this year the Archbishop repaired to Vienna, and\r\nLeopold Mozart seized the opportunity of following him thither with\r\nWolfgang. He looked forward only to a short absence, but when they\r\npresented themselves before the Archbishop in Vienna he gave them\r\npermission to extend their stay, as he intended himself to go into the\r\nmountains and to Gmünd.\r\n\r\nOf the precise object of this tour we know nothing, only that L. Mozart\r\nhints mysteriously that he cannot tell his\r\n\r\n{VISIT TO VIENNA, 1773}\r\n\r\n(145)\r\n\r\nplans to every one, and that he must avoid anything that would excite\r\nattention either at Vienna or Salzburg, and cause obstacles to be thrown\r\nin their way. When the good people of Salzburg connected the illness of\r\nthe kapellmeister Gassmann with his journey, he answered indignantly:\r\n\"Herr Gassmann was ill, but is now better. I do not know what connection\r\nthis may have with our journey to Vienna; but fools will be fools, all\r\nthe world over.\"[1] There can be no doubt, however, that he was anxious\r\nthat Wolfgang should be permanently attached to the court, either at\r\nVienna or elsewhere. The Empress, of whom they immediately sought an\r\naudience, was very gracious, but that was all. The Emperor only returned\r\nfrom Poland towards the end of their stay, and they do not appear to\r\nhave spoken to him at all.\r\n\r\nThey arrived on the 18th of July, and went straight to their old\r\nlodgings, where they surprised old Frau Fischer at supper; she was\r\ndelighted to see them, and to provide them once more with comfortable\r\napartments. Many old friendships were renewed: L'Augier, Martinez,\r\nNovarre, honest old Bono, Stephanie and his lovely wife, Dr. Auerbrugger\r\nand his two daughters, Franziska and Mariane, \"who played charmingly and\r\nwere thorough musicians,\"[2] all welcomed the Mozarts eagerly; Wolfgang\r\nhad grown so as never to be recognised unless his father were with him.\r\n\r\nBut their warmest welcome was from the Messmers, who only regretted that\r\nthey had come without Frau Mozart and Marianne. Since the Mozarts' last\r\nvisit, they had decorated their garden with statues, &c., and had built\r\na theatre, an aviary, a dovecot, a summer-house looking over the\r\nPrater, and they were now turning their house into a comfortable winter\r\nresidence. The whole family were together, including Fräulein Franzl,\r\nwho was seriously ill, and Fräulein Sepperl, an inveterate match-maker,\r\ninteresting herself in the love affairs even of the cook and the\r\nfootman. Here they met their old friends Heufeld, Greiner, Steigentesch,\r\n\r\n{WORKS IN GERMANY.}\r\n\r\n(146)\r\n\r\nGrill, Bono, &c.; and music was the invariable theme of conversation.\r\nMessmer had learned to play the harmonica from Miss Davis, and had an\r\ninstrument made at a cost of 50 ducats, which was finer than that used\r\nby Miss Davis. He played it very well, and so did his little son, who\r\nshowed considerable talent; Wolfgang tried the harmonica, and \"wished he\r\nhad one too.\" The Messmers soon after went farther into the country to\r\nRothmühl, which interrupted this pleasant intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe great public event of the day during their stay in Vienna was the\r\nsuppression of the order of Jesuits. L. Mozart, who followed their\r\nexpulsion with great interest, thought that many good Christians would\r\nconsider the Pope had only jurisdiction in matters of faith, and that\r\nthe Jesuits would probably have been left unmolested if they had been\r\nas poor as the Capucines. In Rome the property of the Jesuits had been\r\nseized ad pias causas, which was easily done, since all that the Pope\r\nappropriated was ad pias causas; the Emperor thought differently, and\r\nhad reserved to himself the right of dispensing the property of the\r\nJesuits. Mozart thinks, too, that the millions taken from the Jesuits\r\nwill awaken the appetite for more of such confiscations.[3]\r\n\r\nWolfgang had taken some work with him. A grand serenata for some fête in\r\nthe family of their friend Andretter was sent from Vienna and performed\r\nat Salzburg in the beginning of August under Meissner's conductorship\r\n(145 K.). Then he set to work to write six quartets (168-173 K.),\r\nwhether by order or not is uncertain; nothing more important, however,\r\ncame to hand. The Jesuits performed the P. Dominicus Mass (66 K.) at\r\ncourt during the Octave of S. Ignatius' day; L. Mozart conducted, and\r\nthe applause was great. The Theatin monks invited them to their service\r\nand banquet on the feast of S. Cajetan, and, the organ not being\r\navailable, Wolfgang had the boldness to execute a concerto on a violin\r\nborrowed from his young friend Teyber. This made such an impression that\r\nin 1782 a lay brother, to whom Wolfgang\r\n\r\n{COMPOSITIONS IN SALZBURG, 1773-74.}\r\n\r\n(147)\r\n\r\nremarked that he had eight years before played a violin concerto in the\r\nchoir, at once addressed him by his name. Of money receipts during this\r\nvisit to Vienna we hear little or nothing; on the contrary, L. Mozart\r\nwrites to his wife that his body grows fat in proportion as his purse\r\ngrows thin; and he consoles her for the fact that he has had to borrow\r\nmoney by declaring that it only proves his having need of money, but\r\nnot of a doctor. Notwithstanding, he considered he had good reasons for\r\nremaining in Vienna. \"Things must and will mend; take courage, God will\r\nhelp us!\"\r\n\r\nWith the end of September they were again in Salzburg, and in December\r\nWolfgang wrote a quintet for stringed instruments (174 K.) and a\r\npianoforte Concerto in D major (175 K.), the first of the long list\r\nafter his early attempts. Almost the whole of the year 1774 was passed\r\nquietly at home; Wolfgang wrote some important church music, two Masses\r\nin F and D major (192,194, K.), a great litany (195 K.), two psalms\r\nfor a Vesper (193 K.), various symphonies (199-202 K.), two complete\r\nserenatas (203, 204, K.), and an interesting divertimento (205 K.). Then\r\ncame a commission from Munich to write a comic opera for the Carnival\r\nof 1775. It is probable that the influence of the Prince Bishop of\r\nChiemsee, Count Ferdinand von Zeil, an enthusiastic patron of Mozart,\r\nhad been exerted on his behalf. The Elector Maximilian III. had also\r\nshown great interest in Mozart in former years, and on this account it\r\nwas impossible for the Archbishop of Salzburg to refuse Wolfgang leave\r\nof absence. The Elector had a decided talent for music, which he had\r\ncultivated by study; he composed church music, and played the bass-viol,\r\nas Naumaun wrote to a friend, \"divinely\"; Burney declared he had heard\r\nno such bass-viol-player since the celebrated Abel. The Elector's sister\r\nalso, the widowed Electress of Saxony Maria Antonia Walburga, known as\r\na poetess, was then on a visit to Munich; she both composed and sang\r\noperas for which she had written the verses.[4] It followed, therefore,\r\n\r\n{WORKS IN GERMANY.}\r\n\r\n(148)\r\n\r\nthat much was done in Munich for orchestra and singers both in the\r\nopera and the churches, although the performances fell short of those in\r\nMannheim.[5]\r\n\r\nOn December 6 Wolfgang set out with his father for Munich, where they\r\nfound a small but comfortable lodging with a _Chanoine et grand custos\r\nde Notre Dame_; this good man showed them honour and hospitality\r\nabove their deserts, as they considered, and often sacrificed his own\r\nconvenience to theirs from sheer friendliness. The intense cold of the\r\njourney had, in spite of precautions, brought on Wolfgang's habitual\r\nmalady, severe toothache, and he was confined to his room with a swelled\r\nface for several days. As soon as possible they made the acquaintance\r\nof those with whom they were to be associated, and were well received\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nThe opera \"La Finta Giardiniera\" is very rich in airs, and Mozart,\r\nfinding a wealth of resources in Munich ready to hand, went to work more\r\nseriously, both with the voices and the orchestra, than was customary\r\nwith an opera buffa. It is impossible to ascertain how much of the opera\r\nhe brought with him, or how much was altered or composed in Munich. The\r\nfirst rehearsal did not take place till near the end of December, and\r\nthe performance was consequently postponed to January 5, 1775, so that\r\nthe singers might be more sure of their parts than could have been the\r\ncase had they played, as intended, on December 29.\r\n\r\n\"You must know,\" writes L. Mozart, \"that the maestro Tozi, who is this\r\nyear writing the opera seria ('Orfeo ed Euridice'), wrote last year at\r\nthis time an opera buffa, and exerted himself to the utmost in order\r\nthat it might surpass the opera seria of Sales (of Trier): he succeeded\r\nin quite eclipsing Maestro Sales' opera.[6] Now it so turns out that\r\nWolfgang's opera is ready just before Tozi's, and all those who heard\r\nthe first rehearsal are saying that Tozi is paid back in his own coin,\r\nsince Wolfgang's opera will\r\n\r\n{\"LA FINTA GIARDINIERA\"--MUNICH, 1775.}\r\n\r\n(149)\r\n\r\nthrow his quite into the shade.[7] I do not like this sort of thing,\r\nand have tried all I can to put an end to the gossip; but the whole\r\norchestra, and all who heard the rehearsal, declare that they\r\nnever heard more beautiful music; all the songs are beautiful.\" The\r\nperformance on January 13,1775, was a brilliant success; the court and\r\nthe public overwhelmed the composer with applause and honours, as he\r\nhimself informs his mother.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Legation, Unger, notes in his journal (January 15,\r\n1775): \"_Vendredi L.A.R.E., assistèrent à la première représentation\r\nde Vopera buffa, 'La Finta Giardiniera'; la musique fut applaudie\r\ngénéralement; elle est du jeune Mozart de Saltzbourg qui se trouve\r\nactuellement ici. C'est le même qui à l'äge de huit ans a été en\r\nAngleterre et ailleurs pour se faire entendre sur le clavecin, qu'il\r\ntouche supérieurement bien_.\"[8] And Schubart writes in the \"Teutsche\r\nChronik\" (1775, p. 267): \"I also heard an opera buffa by the wonderful\r\ngenius Mozart; it is called \"La Finta Giardiniera.\" Sparks of genius\r\nflash out here and there, but it is not yet the calm flame from the\r\naltar, rising to heaven in clouds of incense--a perfume meet for the\r\ngods. If Mozart does not turn out to be a hothouse-reared plant, he will\r\nundoubtedly be one of the greatest composers that has ever lived.\"\r\n\r\nIt was said of the performers that Rossi and Rosa Manservisi were\r\nspecially suited for opera buffa. Rossi was as good as his brother in\r\nStuttgart in merry, waggish parts; Manservisi was above the average of\r\nsingers in voice, execution, and personal appearance.[9]\r\n\r\nThis time Wolfgang's sister enjoyed the pleasure of witnessing his\r\ntriumph. During her visit to Munich she was placed under the care of\r\na certain Frau v. Durst, a sensible well-educated widow, who provided\r\nMarianne with a room to herself and a piano, on which her father took\r\ncare she should practise diligently. Other Salzburg friends arrived for\r\nthe\r\n\r\n{WORKS IN GERMANY.}\r\n\r\n(150)\r\n\r\nCarnival, Eberlin Waberl, Fräulein v. Schiedenhofen, And-retter, and\r\nyoung Molk, who went into such raptures over the opera seria, it was\r\nplain that he had heard nothing outside Salzburg and Inspruck.\r\n\r\nAnother involuntary witness of Mozart's triumph was the Archbishop of\r\nSalzburg. He had occasion to pay a visit to the Elector of Bavaria\r\nin January, 1775,[10] and though he arrived in Munich after the\r\nrepresentation of the opera, and had left before its repetition, he\r\nwas forced, as L. Mozart remarks with satisfaction, to listen to the\r\neulogies pronounced by the electoral suite and all the nobility, and to\r\nreceive the congratulations which were poured on him. He was so taken\r\naback that he could only answer by shaking his head and shrugging his\r\nshoulders. It was little likely that such a scene should have raised\r\nMozart in the favour of a man like Hieronymus.\r\n\r\nThe repetition of the opera, which could only be given on Fridays,\r\nbrought difficulties, inasmuch as the seconda donna, who was wretched\r\neven at her best, fell seriously ill, and the opera had to be\r\nconsiderably curtailed, in order to dispense with her. It took place on\r\nWolfgang's birthday, and he thought it indispensable that he should\r\nbe present at the performance, as otherwise his opera might not\r\nbe recognised. The orchestra was in great confusion, since it was\r\nshamefully neglected by the director Tozi, who was at that time enacting\r\nthe romance in real life with the Countess Törring-Seefeld, of which L.\r\nMozart writes to his wife:--\r\n\r\nSignor Tozi has gone. He had an old-standing love intrigue with\r\nthe Countess v. Seefeld, in which her brother, Count Sedlizky, was\r\nimplicated, as well as a certain tenor, Signor Guerrieri. The Countess\r\nleft Munich six weeks ago on pretence of visiting her estates, but she\r\nhas quite deserted her husband and children, and carried off money\r\nand jewels. The complicity of her brother and the two Italians was\r\ndiscovered by a letter; Count Sedlizky was placed under arrest,\r\nGuerrieri thrown into prison, and Tozi took refuge with the Theatin\r\nmonks. The Elector sent him an assurance that he should not be\r\nimprisoned if he would submit to an examination. He issued from his\r\nhiding-place, but\r\n\r\n{MUNICH, 1775.}\r\n\r\n(151)\r\n\r\nimmediately took flight to Italy. Count Sedlizky confessed everything;\r\nGuerrieri denied everything, but to little avail, since the jewels\r\nwere found in Guerrieri's lodgings, sewed up in an old cushion. It is\r\nsuspected that the Countess is in Holland; there she sits forlorn, since\r\nher projected escort has not joined her.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart writes to his wife to tell this story, \"just to show people\r\nthat Italians are rascals all the world over.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe opera did not put a stop to Wolfgang's church music. His Grand\r\nLitany (125 K.) in B major was performed at the court chapel on New\r\nYear's day, as well as one of his father's; and later on two small\r\nMasses, no doubt those in F and D major (192, 194 K.). A few days\r\nbefore their departure, as Wolfgang writes to Padre Martini, the Elector\r\nexpressed a wish to hear an offertory, contrapuntally worked out, which\r\nwas to be composed, copied, and practised before the following Sunday.\r\nIt was the \"Misericordias Domini,\" to which Padre Martini accorded\r\ngreat praise.[12] As a matter of course, Wolfgang made his mark also as a\r\nclavier-player; with this object he had taken his concerto with him,\r\nand his sister was to bring some of his sonatas and variations. Schubart\r\nwrites in his \"Teutsche Chronik\" (1776, p. 267): \"Only think, my\r\nfriends, what a treat! Last winter, in Munich, I heard two of the\r\ngreatest clavier-players, Herr Mozart and Herr v. Beecke. My host, Herr\r\nAlbert, who is enthusiastic for all that is great and beautiful, has an\r\nexcellent pianoforte in his house. So these two giants strove together.\r\nMozart can play any difficulties, and whatever is laid before him at\r\nsight. But nevertheless, Beecke far surpasses him--winged speed, grace,\r\nmelting sweetness, and a marvellous amount of taste, are weapons which\r\nnone can wrest from the grasp of this Hercules.\"\r\n\r\nThe great and universal applause bestowed on Wolfgang inspired his\r\nfather with the hope that he would be intrusted\r\n\r\n{WORKS IN GERMANY.}\r\n\r\n(152)\r\n\r\nwith the opera seria for the next year; why this was not the case we\r\nare not aware. The rumour current in Salzburg that Wolfgang was about to\r\nenter the Elector's service, L. Mozart ascribes to his enemies, and to\r\nthose whose consciences told them what good cause he had for taking\r\nsuch a step; he was used to such childish folly, and did not allow it to\r\ntrouble him in the least. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that nothing\r\nwould have pleased him more; but, as a prudent man, he did not wish to\r\ncut himself adrift from Salzburg before having secured a safe anchorage\r\nat Munich.\r\n\r\nAfter enjoying to their close the pleasures of the Carnival, which\r\nlasted too long for the father, they returned to Salzburg on March\r\n7,1775. In April the Archbishop of Salzburg was honoured by a visit\r\nfrom the Archduke Maximilian, youngest son of Maria Theresa (b. 1749),\r\nafterwards Archbishop of Cologne; he had been spending the Carnival\r\nin Paris, where his want of tact had placed the Queen in considerable\r\nembarrassment,[13] and had also paid a short visit to Munich. Court\r\nfestivities were arranged, chiefly consisting of musical performances,\r\nfor which the singer Consuoli and Becke, the flautist, were summoned\r\nfrom Munich. A serenata by Fischietti was performed on April 22, and on\r\nthe following day Mozart's \"Re Pastore,\" which had been very hurriedly\r\ncomposed. On April 24, according to the report of one of the Archduke's\r\nsuite, \"Music was the entertainment provided, as on the preceding days;\r\nat the conclusion of the performance, young Mozart placed himself at\r\nthe piano and played various pieces from his head, with equal skill and\r\ngrace.\" Whether he appeared as a violinist we do not know; he had, at\r\nany rate, composed his first violin concerto on April 14 (207 K.), and\r\nthe fact that this was followed by four others in the same year (211,\r\n216, 218, 219, K.) is a proof that he was applying himself energetically\r\nto the violin; possibly because it would be easier to find a good\r\nsituation if he were an accomplished violin-player.\r\n\r\nThe next two years passed quietly and busily at Salzburg. Extracts from\r\na diary kept by young Schiedenhofen show how\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC--\"HAFFNER-MUSIK,\" 1776.}\r\n\r\n(153)\r\n\r\nlimited their circle of friendly intercourse was, and Wolfgang's\r\nauthentically dated compositions afford proofs of his activity and\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe year 1776 was especially rich in church music; four masses (257,\r\n258, 259,261, K.) fall in this year, three of them in its last quarter,\r\nwhile in March a Grand Litany in E flat major (243 K.) was written,\r\nbesides an Offertory, \"Venite populi,\" for two choirs (260 K.). To\r\n1777 belong a Mass (275 K.), and a Graduale, \"Sancta Maria\" (273 K.). A\r\nseries of organ sonatas were furnished for the services of the church,\r\nand for the court a number of divertimenti for wind instruments,\r\nprobably as table music. In other respects, doubtless in consequence of\r\nthe ill-will of the Archbishop, Wolfgang appears to have held aloof from\r\nthe court concerts; no symphonies belong to this time. The serenatas\r\nwere written for other occasions. On wedding-days, fête-days, or the\r\nlike, these nocturnal pieces were usually performed in the street, not\r\nexcepting the solos;[14] they were introduced by a march, in which any\r\nof the company who could handle a bow might take part; the rest listened\r\nfrom the windows above. Such music was either ordered and paid for, or\r\noffered as a tribute of esteem.\r\n\r\nOn the wedding-day of the Salzburg citizen F. X. Spath with Elise\r\nHaffher, daughter of the worthy merchant and Bürgermeister Sigmund\r\nHaffner[15] (July 22,1776), a serenata by Mozart was performed,\r\nafterwards known as the \"Haffner-musik\" (249, 250, K.). Another\r\nopportunity offered in the fête-day of the Countess Antonia Lodron, for\r\nwhom in 1776 and 1777 Wolfgang wrote several specified nocturnes;[16]\r\nSchiedenhofen was present at the rehearsal of one of them, and he tells\r\nus also that on July 25, 1777, there was a\r\n\r\n{OPERA SERIA.}\r\n\r\n(154)\r\n\r\nrehearsal of a serenata at the house of the grocer Gusetti, composed by\r\nWolfgang for his sister's fête-day; it consisted of a symphony, a\r\nviolin concerto played by himself, and a flute concerto played by Cosel.\r\nProbably the divertimento composed in July, 1776 (251 K.) was also\r\nintended for his sister's fête-day. A Finalmusik (185, 215, K.) produced\r\non August 23, 1775, and a \"Serenata Nottuma\" (239 K.) in January, 1776,\r\nare both for unknown occasions.\r\n\r\nThe clavier compositions were also mainly written for pupils or\r\namateurs; for example, the Concerto in C major (246 K.) for the Countess\r\nLitzow or Lützow, wife of the Commandant of Hohen-Salzburg; that in E\r\nflat major (271 K.) for a Madame Jenomy (January, 1777), whom Wolfgang\r\nhad met in Paris; the Concerto for three pianofortes for the Countesses\r\nAntonie, Luise, and Josepha Lodron (242 K.), February, 1776. While the\r\nMozarts were at Munich, in 1775, a landed proprietor, Buron Dümitz, had\r\nordered some pianoforte sonatas, which were duly forwarded (279-284 K.);\r\nbut he altogether forgot to send the promised payment in return. Two\r\nfour-hand sonatas, mentioned by his father (December 8, 1777), were\r\nprobably intended for Wolfgang and his sister; Schiedenhofen heard them\r\nplay a duet on August 15, 1777.\r\n\r\nHaving taken this biograpical survey, it is now time to bestow a closer\r\ninspection on Wolfgang's compositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: After Gassmann's death in 1774, Jos.

OPERA SERIA.\r\n\r\nTHE OPERA[1] owes its rise to the attempt which was made in Florence at\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century to discover the musical method of\r\nancient tragedy and to reproduce it in conformity to the spirit of the\r\nRenaissance.[2]\r\n\r\n{GRADUAL RISE OF OPERA.}\r\n\r\n(155)\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the predominant madrigal style of part-singing, worked\r\nout in counterpoint, there arose strivings after a method which should\r\ngive freedom and independence to the solo singer, and which should\r\nrender the poet's words comprehensible and sympathetic to the hearer.\r\nThe conviction that this was accomplished to perfection in ancient\r\ntragedy led to a search after lost musical traditions, traces of which\r\nare observable in the opera seria, even in its latest development.\r\nFirst, recitative was introduced as a middle course between song and\r\nordinary speech, distinguished by accent and rhythm, and sustained by\r\na simple harmony, which emphasised the dialogue. Time and effort were\r\nneeded to establish this compromise between song and speech, and to\r\nconvert recitative into the pliable, expressive instrument of musical\r\ndialogue.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to place an opera in this _stilo rappresentativo_\r\non the stage was made by Jac. Peri with Ottavio Rinuccini's \"Dafne,\"\r\nperformed in 1594 at the Palazzo Corsi;[3] the same poet's \"Euridice\"\r\nfollowed in 1600, publicly performed on the occasion of the marriage\r\nof Henry IV. with Marie de Medicis. The whole dialogue is rendered in\r\na simply accompanied recitative, without the introduction of anything\r\nresembling an air; to this are added choruses, after the example of the\r\nold tragedies, not worked out in contrapuntal form like madrigals, as\r\nwas already the custom with the intermedii of spoken tragedies, but in\r\nsimple harmonies, and in a key corresponding to the recitatives.\r\n\r\nA similar experiment was made in Rome in 1600 by Emilio de' Cavalieri\r\nwith his oratorio \"Dell' Anima e del Corpo,\" and in Florence the same\r\nyear by Giulio Caccini with another, \"Euridice,\" which displayed the art\r\nof the singers by its numerous embellishments and passages.\r\n\r\nMusical language, however, could only attain its full effect when\r\nthe more elevated sentiments received their due expression in an air,\r\nindependent in character and\r\n\r\n{OPERA SERIA.}\r\n\r\n(156)\r\n\r\nperfect in form. The development of solo singing released from its\r\ncontrapuntal bondage, and made expressive by melody, was largely due\r\nto Caccini. The merit of connecting the air with the recitative\r\nin opera--for which a precedent was found in the monody of ancient\r\ntragedy--belongs to Claudio Monteverde, who also made use of the whole\r\navailable instrumental wealth of the time. His operas of \"Orfeo,\"\r\ncomposed in Mantua (1607), and \"Arianna\" (1608) were followed in Venice,\r\nwhere he was appointed kapellmeister (1613), by \"Proserpina rapita\"\r\n(1630), \"Adone\" (1639), &c. Here, then, were the elements of the opera\r\nseria. To follow its continuous development step by step would require\r\nsuch a searching study of details as has not yet been undertaken. The\r\nmajority of existing accounts are made apparently at random, and without\r\nany idea of connection or dependence. A sketch of the leading points in\r\nthe progress of this development will suffice for our purpose.[4]\r\n\r\nAncient tragedy being taken as a model, it followed that the stories of\r\nancient mythology or history (they were always considered on the same\r\nlevel) were almost exclusively chosen, although treated for the most\r\npart in a widely different spirit.\r\n\r\nOpera soon formed an important feature in court festivals, and it\r\nbecame customary to give the text a reference to the festival or person\r\nhonoured by turning it into an allegory, in which poetical fancy vied\r\nwith personal flattery.[5] In imitation of ancient tragedy mimic dances\r\nwere connected with the singing, but the union of the arts tended more\r\nto sensual enjoyment than to poetical effect. The naïve freedom with\r\nwhich the ancient myths were handled gave ample license for gaudy\r\ncostumes, scenery, and decorations, and the same taste was carried into\r\nthe fantastic outcome of these festival representations known as the\r\nGerman magic opera.\r\n\r\nThe courts of Italy and France vied with each other in\r\n\r\n{DEVELOPMENT OF OPERA--SCARLATTI.}\r\n\r\n(157)\r\n\r\nthe costly splendour lavished on the opera by scene-painters,\r\ndecorators, and costumiers; and Vienna, Munich, Dresden, and Stuttgart\r\nwere not slow to follow their example. The elegantly printed books of\r\nthe words, adorned with careful copper-plate engravings, which were\r\ndistributed for these performances, give some idea of the style in which\r\nthey were put on the stage, and of the dazzle and glitter in the midst\r\nof which the music became a very secondary consideration.\r\n\r\nSuch operas as we have described could, on account of the expense, only\r\nbe given at royal courts on special occasions; but the general public\r\nsoon began to demand a share in the entertainment and a regular\r\nrepetition of it. It became the established custom to make the opera the\r\nmain festivity of the Carnival, and although generous patrons were\r\nnot wanting, prepared to support the managers (_impresarii_), yet the\r\nlatter, who naturally wished to make a profit by the opera, generally\r\nfound it necessary to reduce the cost of the representations. The\r\nlibretti, which sought to excite interest by showy scenery, and a\r\nmixture of pathetic and burlesque situations, without the least regard\r\nto consistency or psychological accuracy, were far from satisfactory to\r\nany cultivated taste. But the cultivation of the art of song exercised\r\nthe highest of all influences on operatic music. It had reached a height\r\nfrom which it was able to govern the musical public, and to render the\r\npleasure of the eye subservient to that of the ear. In proportion as the\r\nvocal art asserted its superiority, it exacted a simplification of all\r\nother means of attraction, and the universal striving after regularity\r\nwas materially assisted by the necessity for clear and decided forms in\r\nvocal music.\r\n\r\nThis transformation of the opera, which took its final form from\r\npoet and composer under the quickening influence of great singers,\r\nis commonly ascribed to Alessandro Scarlatti (1659-1725). He was the\r\ndisciple, although perhaps not the pupil, of the Roman kapellmeister,\r\nGiacomo Carissimi (who was nearly ninety in 1672), who did such good\r\nservice to the development of recitative and dramatic solo singing, that\r\nhe may be considered the founder of modern song.\r\n\r\nScarlatti, excellent alike from his thorough musical\r\n\r\n{OPERA SERIA.}\r\n\r\n(158)\r\n\r\nknowledge, and from the wealth and grace of his invention, displayed\r\nastonishing fertility in the different departments of musical art.\r\nIn the year 1715, according to his own account, he had composed 106\r\noperas.[6] At Naples, where he passed the greater part of his life,\r\nhe founded the school from which (more especially under his successor\r\nFrancesco Durante, 1693-1755) a long list of composers issued, who for\r\nthe most part wrote admirable church music, but whose chief mission it\r\nwas to maintain throughout the last century an uninterrupted succession\r\nof operatic music. If we glance down the long list of the more\r\nfamous--Nic. Porpora (1685 or 1687-1767), Dom. Sarri (1688-1732), Leon.\r\nVinci (1690-1734), Franc. Feo (1694-1740), Leon. Leo (1694-1756?),\r\nAd. Hasse (1699-1783), Terradeglias (17...-1754), Nic. Logroscino\r\n(17...-1763), Pergolese (1707-1739), Pasq. Cafaro (1708-1787), Duni\r\n(1709-1775), Dav. Perez (1711-1778), Nic. Jomelli (1714-1774), Rinaldo\r\nda Capua (b. 1715), Tom. Traetta (1727-1779), Guglielmi (1727-1804),\r\nNic. Piccinni (1728-1800), Sacchini (1735-1786), Pasq. Anfossi\r\n(1736-1797), Giac. Paisiello (1741-1816), Franc, de Majo (1745-1774),\r\nDom. Cimarosa (1754-1801)--we shall be astonished to find that of the\r\nnumerous members of the Neapolitan school only four were born out of the\r\nkingdom of Naples,[7] viz., Hasse, Terradeglias, Pergolese, and Guglielmi.\r\nThe rest of Italy was quite unable to compete with this wealth.\r\n\r\nVenice, however, took an important place in the development of Italian\r\nopera, both by the splendour of the performances given in the theatre,\r\nwhich was erected in 1637,[8] and by excellent institutions for musical\r\neducation. The fame of the Venetian school was upheld by many celebrated\r\ncomposers, among them Carlo Pallavicini (16...-1688), Agost. Steffani\r\n(1655-1730). Franc. Gasparini (1665-1737), Ant. Lotti\r\n\r\n{ITALIAN INFLUENCES ON OPERA.}\r\n\r\n(159)\r\n\r\n(1667-1740), Giov. Porta (16...-1740), Ant. Caldara (1678-1763), Buranello\r\n(1703-1785), Ferd. Bertoni (1725-1813).\r\n\r\nBologna too had its share in the history of the opera, maintaining\r\na firm tradition of careful performances,[9] and excellent schools for\r\nsinging and composition; Giov. Buonon-cini (1672-1752) and Gius. Sarti\r\n(1729-1802) were trained here.\r\n\r\nRome was looked upon as the city where the keenest enthusiasm either\r\nof applause or adverse criticism was to be expected, consequently where\r\nartistic reputations were most often made or destroyed;[10] but Rome was\r\nneither the birthplace nor the seminary of any famous operatic masters.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to inquire into the details of the part taken\r\nby Scarlatti in the erection of Italian opera as it now exists. His\r\noperas are truly epitomes of the history of musical development, and\r\nhis many imitators and successors pass before us like the shadows of the\r\nHomeric shades; but we have only to do with him or with them in so far\r\nas concerns the main features of that form of operatic composition which\r\nMozart found ready to hand.[11]\r\n\r\nThe stability with which operatic development kept close to the path\r\nwhich had at first been marked out was due partly to circumstances and\r\nthe influence of public opinion, partly to the character of the Italian\r\npeople. Beauty, appealing immediately and directly to their lightly\r\nkindled imaginations, required that its sensual charm should be clearly\r\nand unreservedly expressed; and for this they were willing to sacrifice\r\nnovelty and characterisation. Again, the art of music was developed in\r\naccordance with natural laws; and having once acquired forms indicative\r\nof its essential elements, it grasped these firmly, and refused to\r\nabandon them until they had become completely obsolete. It was the task\r\nof the great masters of the eighteenth century to\r\n\r\n{OPERA SERIA.}\r\n\r\n(160)\r\n\r\nmaintain this course of steady imperceptible progress, and, by raising\r\nto successive stages each hardly won step towards perfection, to\r\nestablish in the end a new and more admirable whole.\r\n\r\nThe chief component parts of the opera were the recitative and the song,\r\nor aria.[12] Recitative, intended for the rendering of conversation,\r\napproaches in rhythm and intervals as near as possible to ordinary\r\nspeech, and leaves the singer ample scope for an animated and expressive\r\ndelivery. This is assisted by a simple harmonious accompaniment, the\r\nbasses giving the fundamental, the clavier the harmony. The simplicity\r\nof the musical treatment lends itself to characteristic declamation, and\r\nimpressive situations are thrown into relief generally by sudden changes\r\nof harmony; numerous instances show the importance that was attached to\r\nthis mode of delivery. But very soon it became the fashion to treat this\r\n_recitativo secco_ as subordinate, and the composer strove to do away\r\nwith it as far as possible. Certain turns, certain harmonic progressions\r\nand interrupted cadences, were as indispensable to recitative as many\r\nturns of speech are to social intercourse. As the course and development\r\nof the action of the piece depend almost entirely on the recitative,\r\nit follows that any neglect of the latter must affect one of the most\r\nimportant elements of the opera. The need for attaining the power of\r\nexpressing a momentary passion or inspiration which would not admit of\r\nan elaborate representation led to the introduction of the so-called\r\naccompanied (obligate) recitative. For this the orchestra (at first only\r\nthe whole body of stringed instruments) was made use of, and accompanied\r\nthe alternations of emotion with corresponding musical phrases\r\nor interludes. Recitative, without abandoning its distinctive\r\ncharacteristics, became more strongly accentuated, and in process of\r\ntime passed over into song. Such vocal melodies as seemed thus to be\r\ncalled forth by the emotions of the situations were called _cavata_ or\r\n_cavatina_. At first they were\r\n\r\n{RECITATIVE--THE ARIA.}\r\n\r\n(161)\r\n\r\nconsidered as an ingredient or embellishment of the recitative, but later\r\non they were treated independently. _Arioso_ in the recitative indicates\r\nan interpolated passage of vocal melody. A rapid alternation of varied\r\nor contending emotions in monologue or dialogue called for accompanied\r\nrecitative, which generally passed into a song, where a definite emotion\r\nmight find its due expression. It was here that singers and composers\r\nsought to accomplish the highest degree of dramatic expression, and\r\nalthough in the aria they might be tempted to an undue regard for\r\nmusical display, to the neglect of dramatic effect, here at least they\r\nstrove for a faithful portrayal of human sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe aria was the almost exclusive form given to regular artistic song.\r\nChoruses, which formerly concluded every act, were afterwards only\r\nexceptionally employed, generally when the occasion, being a court\r\nfestivity, required additional outward show; they very seldom formed\r\nan integral part of the performance.[13] Ballets, which were originally\r\ncombined with the choruses, became by degrees quite distinct, and\r\nwere given between the acts of the opera. Concerted vocal pieces were\r\nconfined within limits more and more strictly defined, until the rule\r\ncame to be that in every opera there should be a duet for the prima\r\ndonna and the primo uomo, and a terzet in which the primo tenore also\r\ntook part; even the places for these, at the end of the second and third\r\nacts, were appointed. Further restrictions were imposed on the character\r\nof these concerted pieces by the necessity of giving all possible effect\r\nto the voices. They do not pretend to represent a conflict of struggling\r\npassions, pressing onward to the catastrophe; rather does some definite\r\nmood, the natural result of the situations which have preceded it, find\r\nits fitting expression in their regular concerted form, which affords\r\nample scope for the display of varieties in quality and style of the\r\nindividual voices.\r\n\r\nThe aria, which gave expression to a fixed lyrical mood, was seldom\r\nthe culminating point of a dramatic situation; its connection with the\r\naction of the piece was, for the most\r\n\r\n{OPERA SERIA.}\r\n\r\n(162)\r\n\r\npart, only sufficient to give it a certain local colour. It was the task\r\nof both composer and singer to make the aria fit in to the drama; but\r\nthe claims of the vocalist were paramount in its composition. As the\r\ncanons of operatic construction became more and more strictly defined,\r\ndistinctions arose between different kinds of arie, each having its\r\nown character and form; the _aria cantabile_ was for sentimental\r\ndeclamation, _di portamento_ for long drawn-out tones, _di mezzo\r\ncarattere_ for dramatic expression, _aria parlante_ or _agitata_ for the\r\nexpression of passion, _aria di bravura (agilità)_ for the display of\r\nartistic skill of every kind.[14] The poet and composer had only to be\r\ncareful to suit the arie to the performers, and so to distribute them\r\nthrough the opera that their variety should place the performances of\r\neach character in their most favourable light.[15] But a certain\r\nfixed form served as a groundwork to all arie, and kept them within\r\nwell-defined bounds. It is easy to trace the simple expressive phrase as\r\nit is extended and rounded into a well-formed melody, and then to\r\nfollow the different subjects so obtained until, by progressions and\r\ninterludes, they are welded into a whole. But this led to a petrifying\r\nformalism, and to a tedious lengthening of the aria, which sacrificed\r\ncharacter to vocal display.\r\n\r\nAn aria regularly consists of two parts differing in key, time, and\r\nmeasure. An allegro in common time usually begins, introduced by a\r\nslower passage in triple time; but as to this there is no fixed rule,\r\nand free scope as to details is given to the composer. The first\r\nmovement is broadly conceived, always with a view to the skill of the\r\nperformer; he repeats one or more of the principal melodies in different\r\npositions, but without thematic elaboration, and inserts runs and\r\npassages.\r\n\r\nIn the second part the composer, granting some repose to the singer,\r\nmade a display of his own art by selected harmonies, elaborate\r\naccompaniments, and so forth. It was\r\n\r\n{THE ARIA.}\r\n\r\n(163)\r\n\r\nessential to the singer's reputation as an artist that he should be\r\nable to vary the modulation and embellishment of the melody each time\r\nit recurred, the composer supplying a mere outline, and leaving the\r\nexecution of the cadenzas entirely to the discretion of the performer.\r\nThis task became more difficult as the custom grew of repeating the\r\nwhole of the first part at the close of the second, thus turning the\r\nlatter into a middle movement; for no singer would be deterred from\r\nenhancing the interest of each repetition by a fresh mode of delivery.\r\nSo that the public performers of that day displayed their taste and\r\ncultivation not only, as at present, by execution and declamation; they\r\nworked of necessity side by side with the composer, whose special glory\r\nit was to inspire his singers with a spark of his own creative genius.\r\n\r\nThe influence thus exerted by the executive artist could not fail\r\nto determine, to a great extent, the path of development in operatic\r\ncomposition. The great names of the more celebrated singers are to us\r\nindeed but names, for contemporary notices give us no clear idea of\r\ntheir performances,[16] and the music written for them, deprived of\r\nthe direct charm of their personal impression, affords a most imperfect\r\nstandard of judgment.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the last century the tendency to sacrifice all\r\nconsideration to execution (bravura) became more and more marked; until\r\nat last, dramatic propriety, and the soul-inspiring calm of beautiful\r\nsong, were alike buried beneath the weight of ornamentation and\r\nexaggerated flourishes,[17] serving only to display the pretensions of\r\nthe vocalist and the dexterity of the composer. In this way the dramatic\r\nelement of the opera became more and more neglected, until at last\r\nit was regarded as a superfluous and disturbing adjunct to the\r\nvocalisation.[18]\r\n\r\n{OPERA SERIA.}\r\n\r\n(164)\r\n\r\nThe public too grew accustomed to confine their attention to the\r\nindividual exploits of their favourites;[19] and the composer, unwilling\r\nto waste his energy on thankless parts, followed the example, and\r\ndevoted his whole powers to a few individuals.[20]\r\n\r\nThe enormous salary paid to celebrated singers, male and female, had the\r\neffect of limiting the number of principal parts to three or four, each\r\ndistinguished as primo.[21] The remaining parts were treated by both\r\nthe poet and the composer as subordinate, not only on account of the\r\nmediocre powers available for their representation, but also and chiefly\r\nbecause it would have been against the interests of the great singers\r\nthat secondary characters should attract notice or applause. They\r\ncontrolled all secondary parts, suppressing or appropriating any song\r\nwhich they considered too brilliant, and leaving the author to arrange\r\nthe piece as best he might.[22] There was a fixed code of etiquette in\r\nall stage arrangements. The prima donna, for instance, was entitled to\r\nhave her train borne by one, or if a princess, by two pages; she took\r\nthe place of honour at the right of the stage, being, as a rule, the\r\nmost important personage of the piece. When Faustina Hasse played\r\nDircea, in \"Demofoonte\" (1748), who is not recognised as a princess\r\nuntil late in the piece, she claimed precedence over the acknowledged\r\nPrincess Creusa, and Metastasio himself was obliged to interfere in\r\norder to induce her to yield the point.[23]\r\n\r\nThus all influences combined to mould the opera seria into a narrow\r\nconventional form, in which all other considerations were sacrificed\r\nto executive effect, and the display of skill and sensibility in the\r\nrendering of the music.\r\n\r\nWe can form no clear conception whatever of the operatic\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTATION--THE OVERTURE.}\r\n\r\n(165)\r\n\r\norchestra in its earliest form; both the use and the effect of various\r\ninstruments are very imperfectly known, and the instrumentation is\r\nconsequently more or less incomprehensible. But here too development\r\nproceeded in the way of simplification, and at the time of Scarlatti\r\nthe treatment of instrumental accompaniment and the disposal of the\r\norchestra was determined as to essentials for all future times.\r\n\r\nIn the plain recitative of the dialogue, the fundamental note was\r\ngiven by the bass, and the chord was struck on the piano (at which the\r\ncomposer or kapellmeister conducted) and repeated as often as necessary.\r\nIn the songs and _ensembles_ the instruments came in as accompaniments,\r\nfreed from the obligation of following a given melody step by step with\r\na given bass, according to the rules of thoroughbass for filling up\r\nharmonies. Scarlatti and the earlier masters kept this accompaniment\r\nvery simple, seldom introducing more than one part in addition to the\r\nbass and the voice. But, as practised contrapuntists, they could handle\r\nthe accompanying parts broadly and freely, and could give animation\r\nby simple means. This art gradually decreased, and the accompaniment,\r\nalthough fuller, became more mechanical and dependent, Only here and\r\nthere suggesting contrapuntal elaboration. The orchestra was used\r\nindependently only in the symphonies which repeated the motifs of the\r\nsongs, in the short interludes of accompanied recitative, and finally in\r\nthe introductory overture or sinfonia.\r\n\r\nItalian operatic composers began by making use of the form of overture\r\nwhich Lully had established in France, beginning with an adagio,\r\nfollowed by a quick movement, often in the form of a fugue, and passing\r\nagain into an adagio, which concludes the overture. Later, the form\r\nwas determined which has remained ever since, of three movements:\r\nan allegro, a slower, shorter movement contrasting in time,\r\ninstrumentation, and expression, and a concluding allegro, animated and\r\noften noisy.\r\n\r\nThese main features were capable of rich and varied development, were it\r\nnot that in Italy little importance was attached to the overture, which\r\nwas commonly regarded as a\r\n\r\n{OPERA SERIA.}\r\n\r\n(166)\r\n\r\nmeans of reducing the audience to silence and attention. The three\r\nmovements, therefore, generally preserved their gradations without\r\nmarked characteristics, and the attempt to express the effect of the\r\nfirst scene by means of the overture was soon abandoned.[24]\r\n\r\nThe grouping of Scarlatti's orchestra was in its main points identical\r\nwith that of the present day. The stringed instruments, violins, tenors,\r\nand basses formed its main strength; but their application was very\r\nsimple. The violon-celli go regularly with the double-basses, and the\r\ntenors serve generally only to strengthen the bass; where they are\r\nindependent they are often divided, like the violins, which however\r\nfrequently go together. The oboe has the chief part among the wind\r\ninstruments, the flutes serving mainly for variety and special\r\ncharacteristics; the bassoons strengthen the bass, and are rarely used\r\nindependently. Soon horns were employed, and drums and trumpets when\r\nspecial splendour was required; trombones were used in the churches,\r\nnever in the opera.\r\n\r\nIn this manner even the largest orchestras were arranged down to the\r\nclose of the last century; an example is afforded by the construction\r\nand arrangement of the Dresden orchestra by Hasse, which was considered\r\nas a model.[25] [See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{THE ORCHESTRA--INSTRUMENTALISTS.}\r\n\r\n(167)\r\n\r\nThe well-appointed bass parts are the most striking, intended as a firm\r\nfoundation for the vocal melody, which is not seldom strengthened by the\r\nviolins and oboes or flutes. But to avoid any effect of poverty, it\r\nmust not be forgotten that the accompanist at the piano filled in the\r\nharmony. To strengthen this, and to give variety to the intonation, was\r\nthe task of the wind instruments. But when the orchestra was treated\r\nas a whole there was seldom any attempt to render lights and shades\r\nby alternations of the instruments; to attain this end, concerted solo\r\ninstruments were employed.\r\n\r\nItaly was, during the eighteenth century, at once the mother and\r\nthe nurse of instrumental musicians. A succession of first-rate\r\nviolinists--Arcang. Corelli (1653-1713), Franc. Geminiani (1680-1762),\r\nAnt. Vivaldi (16...-1743), Gius. Tartini (1692-1770), Pietro\r\nNardini (1722-1793), Gaet. Pugnani (1727-1803), Ant. Lolli\r\n(1733-1802)--established the glory of violin-playing, and raised it to\r\nan extraordinary height of excellence; while as oboists the brothers\r\nBesozzi, Alessandro (1700-1775), Antonio (1707-1781), Gaetano\r\n(1727-1793) were performers of the first merit. Trumpets were at that\r\ntime more especially considered as solo instruments.\r\n\r\nNot until later could Germany compete successfully with Italy, as far\r\nas the orchestra was concerned; in France, although the precision\r\nof Parisian orchestras was always remarkable, the development\r\nof instrumental music was longest delayed. Scarlatti introduced\r\ninstrumental soloists in the operatic orchestra, and the effect was the\r\nsame as on the stage; it worked against the careful striving after a\r\nperfect whole, and the tendency of the instrumental artists to enter\r\ninto competition with the vocalists led in no small degree to that\r\ntreatment of the voice as a mere instrument which was so much to be\r\ndeplored. Notably Farinelli in 1722 established his reputation in Rome\r\nby a contest with a wonderful trumpeter, whom he twice vanquished in the\r\nsustenance and artistic delivery of a long note, and in the execution of\r\ndifficult passages.[26]\r\n\r\n{OPERA SERIA.}\r\n\r\n(168)\r\n\r\nThe first step towards simplifying opera seria in its new form was made\r\nin the diction and treatment of the plot. The subject-matter continued\r\nto be taken from the stories of mythology or ancient history; but\r\neffects of magic and show were abolished, and a connected well-developed\r\nplot was substituted, simple in action, and confined to a small number\r\nof personages. Next, the previous mixture of the tragic and comic\r\nelements was abolished, and everything approaching to burlesque strictly\r\ninterdicted. The chief efforts in this direction were made by the Roman\r\nSilvio Stampiglia (d. 1722), to whom Apostolo Zeno awards more of genius\r\nand spirit than thorough cultivation,[27] and whom Arteaga calls dry and\r\nunmusical.[28] Apostolo Zeno himself (1688-1750) followed in the\r\nsame path as court poet to Charles VI. He was a man of education and\r\nlearning, and as such sought to model the opera on ancient tragedy in\r\nits best and most manly form, and strove for a naturally developed plot,\r\ncorrect delineation of character, and simplicity of language. He proved,\r\nsaid Metastasio,[29] that the opera and good sense are not absolutely\r\ncontradictory terms. The fact that his operas were often and\r\nsuccessfully performed during the first half of the century bears\r\ntestimony to the simplicity and earnestness of the musical taste of the\r\ntime; later on, as the field of music extended its limits, his text was\r\nfound pedantic.[30] His indisputable merit[31] was thrown into the\r\nshade by Metastasio's works;[32] these denote in a remarkable degree the\r\nspirit of the time which produced them, a spirit that they themselves\r\nfostered and encouraged.\r\n\r\nMetastasio (Pietro Trapassi, 1698-1782) distinguished himself as a\r\nboy by his talent for improvisation; he received a thorough learned\r\neducation from the celebrated Roman\r\n\r\n{METASTASIO.}\r\n\r\n(169)\r\n\r\njurist Gravina, which led to his adoption of classical antiquity as his\r\nmodel; while his connection with the singer Marianna Bulgarini early\r\ngave him an insight into the technical requirements of the opera. He\r\nbegan his career as a librettist in 1724 with \"Didone\" at Naples; in\r\n1730 he went to Vienna as court poet, where he lived on the best\r\nof terms with the Imperial family,[33] and highly esteemed by the\r\ncultivated public. Following Apostolo Zeno, he sought to supply his\r\noperas with a true dramatic form, and he made it his chief aim to\r\nportray the effect of different characters and passions upon the\r\ndevelopment of the action. Metastasio had no large or powerful\r\nconceptions, nor could he grasp strong passions; his psychological\r\nvision is clear and cool, but limited, just as his sentiments are\r\ncorrect and good, but neither wide nor free. In his dramas, therefore,\r\nthe representation of character and the plot are well-considered,\r\nsuitable, and consistent, but with a certain mediocrity running through\r\nthe whole; he chiefly concerns himself with the exemplification of\r\nprinciples and experiences, and individualises but little.[34] He makes\r\nlove the animating element of his drama, and the starting point of his\r\npsychological study of motives. His characters want neither life nor\r\npassion, but softness and veiled sensuality are the characteristic\r\nfeatures of what he endeavoured to make an imitation of actual life. The\r\npublic were gratified at recognising themselves and their love affairs\r\nglorified on the stage, and were grateful to Metastasio for allowing\r\nthem to enjoy themselves in their own way, and not preaching moderation\r\nand self-control. They admired his language too, which is correct, and\r\ncharmingly melodious and natural in expression, not more rhetorical\r\nthan the Italian language and poetry demands, and never overlaid with\r\nconceits.\r\n\r\nTo these qualities of a dramatic poet, Metastasio joined that of an\r\noperatic composer; he was a musician. He had cultivated his musical\r\ntalent by intercourse with singers and\r\n\r\n{OPERA SERIA.}\r\n\r\n(170)\r\n\r\ncomposers, and had a ready perception of what was necessary to a work\r\nwritten for composition. He sang \"come un serafino\" (as he writes\r\njokingly to Farinelli),[35] played the clavier, and composed a little\r\nhimself;[36] he found it a pleasant incitement to poetical activity to\r\nseat himself at the clavier and improvise. He said himself he had\r\nnever written a song without composing it himself, according to his own\r\nconception of its musical character.[37]\r\n\r\nMetastasio confines the development of the plot as a rule to the\r\nrecitative and the arie (or duet, or terzet), expressing at the close\r\nof each scene the sentiment which is the result of the previous action.\r\nThis they always did so clearly and precisely that the composer had both\r\nincentive and scope for musical treatment.\r\n\r\nThe too numerous figures and metaphors (which he was fond of borrowing\r\nfrom the sea) express the taste of the time, and so far from troubling\r\nthe musician, gave him opportunities for musical painting which was sure\r\nto be admired. The melodious language met the music half way, while the\r\nsimple yet varied rhythm, the contrast of ideas, and the construction\r\nof the verse, aided the composer, without fettering him, in the musical\r\nphrasing of his work.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that Metastasio reigned supreme over the stage and its\r\ncomposers, and that he was the model of the later operatic poets; they\r\nsucceeded best in imitating his defects, and gave Naumann occasion to\r\nsay with justice, \"The oldest of Metastasio's operas is more pleasing to\r\nme than any written by our present poets.\"\r\n\r\nMetastasio was well aware that the poet only supplies a stem to the\r\nopera, which the composer clothes with foliage and blossom;[38] but he\r\nwas far from allowing the composer absolute dominion over the poet, and\r\nprided himself on the\r\n\r\n{CONDITIONS OF LIBRETTO-WRITING.}\r\n\r\n(171)\r\n\r\nfact that his operas had been played with applause as tragedies without\r\nmusic both in France and Germany.[39]\r\n\r\nHe chose to consider the composer as the interpreter of the poet, and\r\nbound to follow his indications of character and style.[40] This was in\r\nhis opinion the chief merit of the old composers, and in his later years\r\nhe was never weary of deploring the decline of music, which was the\r\nconsequence of the license taken by vocalists, destroying alike truth\r\nand beauty of expression.[41]\r\n\r\nThe poet not less than the composer found himself hemmed in by\r\nconditions as well as by traditional formulas. He too performed his task\r\nto order, and was hampered by circumstances, and by the limited means at\r\nhis command in his choice of subject and characters.\r\n\r\nIt was in no way favourable to Zeno and Metastasio that they received\r\ntheir commissions from the court;[42] besides the direct influence\r\nof the taste of the _somme padrone_, the whole atmosphere tended to\r\neffeminacy and a uniform level in style. The impresarii chose the\r\nlibretti for the composers they had engaged, partly according to the\r\napplause the subjects had already received, but more to suit the singers\r\nthey had at command. They were altered to suit the occasion sometimes by\r\nthe poet himself, but more often some local poet undertook the necessary\r\ncurtailments and additions, whereby the work seldom profited.[43]\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(172)\r\n\r\nThe absolute monarchy of Zeno and Metastasio, whom all other poets\r\nslavishly imitated, would alone suffice to explain the fact that in\r\nthe course of the last century opera seria received the fixed and\r\nunalterable form it still retains; we have seen that the tendency was\r\nthe same as regards the music. This makes it comprehensible that in\r\nreading the text or the scores in the present day we have so lively an\r\nimpression that they are but copies of one original. In no art does the\r\nfeeling for what is enduring pass so easily and quickly into the taste\r\nfor what pleases the age as in music. What affords most delight to the\r\npresent often expresses only a transitory mood with a momentary\r\ntruth, and when the smoke and the fragrance which surrounded it have\r\ndisappeared, only an empty form remains; just as a mask keeps the\r\nimpression of the features without the play of the muscles, which alone\r\ngive life and expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is not known when this term came into use--both before and after\r\nothers were customary: Dramma musicale, dramma per musica, melodramma\r\n[Footnote Menestrier].

MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.\r\n\r\nMOZART found rules as to the form and technicalities of the opera[1]\r\nseria rigidly laid down even to the minutest details, and he was the\r\nless tempted to disregard these, since the extraordinary ease of\r\nhis invention prevented his ever finding a prescribed form to be a\r\nburdensome restriction. Mozart's mission was not to overstep the bounds\r\nof custom, but quietly and gradually to bring to perfection all that was\r\ngenuine and true in the diverse elements of his time. He found the opera\r\nalready in the hands of the vocalists, and execution had by this time\r\nasserted its victory over characterisation. He did not attempt to\r\nenter the lists against singers and public, but contented himself\r\nwith striving for fair conditions. He was willing to write to the\r\nsatisfaction of the singers, and for the display of their powers, but he\r\nsaw no necessity for\r\n\r\n{\"MITRIDATE.\"}\r\n\r\n(173)\r\n\r\nsacrificing to this object either musical beauty or dramatic force. At\r\ntimes the dramatic situations in Mozart's early operas are true and even\r\nstriking; but the dramatic element yields on the whole to execution and\r\neuphony. It must not be overlooked that the apprehension of dramatic\r\ntruth and character varies with different times and different nations,\r\nand that the genius of first-rate artists could inspire life into what\r\nnow appears a lifeless assemblage of notes. But it must at the same time\r\nbe allowed that Mozart's operas of this period come under the influence\r\nof a taste perverted in many respects, which the youthful master had not\r\nyet overcome; and his forced compliance with many purely conventional\r\ndemands must of necessity have left traces on his work as deep and\r\nlasting as those of his creative genius.\r\n\r\nThe opera of \"Mitridate, Re di Ponto\" (87 K.) was first adapted from\r\nRacine by the Abbé Parini, and revised by Vitt. Am. Cigna-Santi. The\r\ndramatis persona are as follows:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nOn the news of the death of Mithridates the inhabitants of Nymphæa\r\ndeliver up the keys of the town to his son Sifares. Aspasia seeks his\r\nprotection against the suit of his brother Pharaaces, thereby betraying\r\nher partiality for Sifares, which he secretly returns. Pharaaces\r\nattempts to force his hand on Aspasia, whereupon Sifares throws himself\r\nbetween them; Arbates separates the contending brothers with\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(174)\r\n\r\nthe news of the landing of Mithridates; they are reconciled, and agree\r\nto keep secret from their father what has passed. Marzio promises to the\r\nambitious Phamaces the help of the Romans against his father.\r\n\r\nMithridates enters, proud and courageous in spite of the defeat he has\r\njust suffered, and is received by his sons; he introduces to Pharnaces\r\nhis destined bride Ismene, who regards Pharnaces with little favour.\r\nThe demeanour of his sons awakens the suspicions of Mithridates, and on\r\nArbates revealing to him the passion of Pharnaces for Aspasia, he falls\r\ninto an extravagant rage. Pharnaces acknowledges to Ismene that he no\r\nlonger loves her; whereat, wounded alike in her pride and her love,\r\nshe complains to Mithridates. The latter resolves to punish him, and\r\nsuspecting from Aspasia's cold demeanour towards himself that she\r\nreturns the love of Pharnaces, he sets Sifares to watch her. The lovers\r\nof course now come to an understanding, but Aspasia virtuously commands\r\nSifares to leave her for ever to the fulfilment of her duty.\r\n\r\nMithridates, in order to test the fidelity of his sons, consults with\r\nthem on the prosecution of the war; he discovers the complicity of\r\nPharnaces with the Romans, and orders his imprisonment; Pharnaces\r\nacknowledges his çuilt, but accuses Sifares of the greater guilt\r\nof complicity with Aspasia. In order to try her, Mithridates offers\r\ngenerously to resign her hand to Pharnaces, which draws from her the\r\nconfession of her love for Sifares; this so infuriates Mithridates that\r\nhe resolves to slay his two sons and Aspasia. This is the crisis at\r\nwhich the second act is brought to a conclusion by a duet, in which the\r\nlovers declare death preferable to separation.\r\n\r\nIn the third act, Ismene, repenting her resentment, strives to soften\r\nMithridates, and Aspasia solicits Sifares' life with an assurance of\r\nhis innocence; but, as she refuses to give her hand to Mithridates, he\r\nmaintains his resolve, and the triple execution is to take place during\r\na sally which he makes on the Roman host besieging the city. Aspasia is\r\non the point of emptying the fatal bowl, when Sifares, who has been\r\nset free by Ismene, snatches it from her, and rushes against the enemy.\r\nPharnaces, who has been released from his dungeon by the besieging\r\nRomans, is seized with compunction and returns to his obedience, setting\r\nfire to the Roman fleet. The Romans are defeated, but Mithridates is\r\nmortally wounded; before he dies he unites Aspasia and Sifares, and\r\npardons Pharnaces, who has made his peace with Ismene.\r\n\r\nThe opera consists of twenty-four numbers without counting the overture;\r\nthey are all solo songs, except one duet and the concluding quintet.[2]\r\nThe original score appears to be lost; but several detached numbers of\r\nthis opera are\r\n\r\n{ANALYSIS OP \"MITRIDATE.\"}\r\n\r\n(175)\r\n\r\npreserved in different forms of composition, showing that Mozart had\r\nmade various experiments, more, doubtless, to please the singers than\r\nhimself. Of the first air of Mithridates (7), \"Se di lauri il crino\r\nadomo,\" there are four different sketched studies; Aspasia's song (13),\r\n\"Nel grave tormento,\" is begun in a different form, but breaks off at\r\nonce; five other numbers are completely worked out, but have given place\r\nto later arrangements.[3]\r\n\r\nThis opera comes in all respects within the rules of the existing opera\r\nseria. Musical etiquette is strictly adhered to; the principal and\r\nsecondary parts are divided in the usual way; the secondary parts are\r\neasier (not always simpler), and their character is tamer and less\r\nimportant, so that they may act as foils and connecting links to\r\nthe principal parts. The chief singers had to be furnished with\r\nopportunities for making effect as soon as they appeared; and must have\r\nat least one great aria in each act. All this is carefully provided\r\nfor. The compass and executive skill of the artists, more especially of\r\nBernasconi and d' Ettore, must have been extraordinary. The division of\r\nthe aria into two movements, which prevails here as elsewhere, favours\r\nthe elaboration of details by affording more than one principal subject.\r\nWe must not expect to find a uniform florid song, the ornamental\r\npassages growing out of and entwining the chief melody, like an\r\narchitectural ornamentation; they form an integral part of the\r\ncomposition. The taste in such passages is essentially\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(176)\r\n\r\nfleeting, for it depended chiefly on the skill of the individual\r\nperformer; what is most admired in one age is least pleasing to the\r\nnext. The same dismemberment made itself apparent too, in the cantilene.\r\nThe various vocal tricks, long notes, sustained melodies, long jumps,\r\nsyncopated passages, &c., to which due effect had to be given, could\r\nnot be thrown together without some connecting principle. For this\r\nthe subjects of the songs were made use of, but the effect was still\r\ndisjointed and inartistic. The detached phrases were usually still\r\nfurther separated by a full or a half cadenza, to which an instrumental\r\ninterlude was often attached. No doubt this wealth of variety was then\r\nconsidered a great charm; now we miss unity of form and conception.\r\nThe turns of harmony are generally monotonous and poor, the form of the\r\ncadenza with its trills is just as stereotyped as that of the present\r\nday with its suspended sixth, and both the singer and the public\r\nexpected and required that this should be so. No doubt the freedom which\r\nwas allowed to the singer in delivery often gave quite a different\r\nform to the cadenza, but the want of conception could at best but be\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\nThese shortcomings are not to be ascribed in Mozart's case to youthful\r\nimmaturity, but to the musical conditions of the time at which he\r\nwrote; they are equally observable in the works of the most experienced\r\ncontemporary musicians, and were indeed hardly regarded as blemishes.\r\nThe question involuntarily arises what there was in these early operas\r\nwhich could so enchant the public and draw from a master like Hasse the\r\nprediction that this youth would eclipse them all. A witty artist once\r\ndeclared that the public always requires novelty, but it must be novelty\r\nthat they are acquainted with; anything really new demands too great an\r\neffort of comprehension from them. In this case, no doubt, the public,\r\nagreeably prepossessed by the readiness with which the work complied\r\nwith all existing conditions, were quick to appreciate the skill and\r\ntaste which were manifest, as well as a certain youthful freshness, and\r\nhere and there traits more significant still of genius; traits in which\r\nHasse recognised the germ of future development. We, who know Mozart in\r\nthe full perfection of his powers, seek eagerly in\r\n\r\n{ANALYSIS OF \"MITRIDATE.\"}\r\n\r\n(177)\r\n\r\nthese earlier works for such indications as there are of his future\r\ngreatness. Sometimes, even in the bravura songs, pure, grand touches of\r\nmelody light up their conventional surroundings; these are usually\r\nin the second part, and in the minor key. The more dramatic\r\n\"situation-songs\" in which the composer made fewer concessions to the\r\nsingers, are not only conciser in form, but more pregnant and original\r\nin expression.\r\n\r\nThe most striking among them is the song of Aspasia (4). Upon the\r\nnews of the arrival of Mithridates, whereby she knows Sifares to be\r\nin danger, and her love for him rendered hopeless, she utters these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n     Nel sen mi palpita dolente il core\r\n     Mi chiama a piangere il mio dolore,\r\n     Non resistere, non so restar.\r\n\r\n     Ma se di lagrime umido è il ciglio\r\n     È solo, credimi, il tuo periglio\r\n     La cagion barbara del mio penar.\r\n\r\nGrief, which seems too deep for words, here breaks forth in such an\r\nuncontrollable flood of song, expressed with so much truth and nature,\r\nthat a dramatic artist like Bernasconi would be sure to make an\r\nextraordinary effect by it. The simple, purely musical means\r\nemployed, the expressive flowing melodies, rich harmonies, suitable\r\naccompaniments, and charming moderation of expression--all these show us\r\nthe genuine Mozart.\r\n\r\nShould it be objected that the milk-and-water heroism of the piece\r\nis still further debased by gallantry in powder and gold lace, we can\r\nnevertheless claim for it, after all deductions made, a certain amount\r\nof stateliness and dignity. These qualities are indeed displayed more\r\naccording to court etiquette than to classical antiquity, but they\r\nare unmistakably there, conformably to the manners of the time and the\r\nnation, and their artistic significance is not small. Mithridates,\r\nwho has most of individual character after Aspasia, never forgets, as\r\nSonnleithner justly observes, that he is first tenor as well as king;\r\nbut on the other hand he always remembers that he is king as well as\r\nfirst tenor.\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(178)\r\n\r\nThe text of the opera \"Lucio Silla,\" composed in 1772 (135 K.), was\r\nwritten by Giovanni da Camera, and according to the preface, revised by\r\nMetastasio. The programme runs:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nCecilio, a senator, banished by Silla, has secretly returned to Rome to\r\nlearn the fate of his betrothed Junia, daughter of C. Marius; his friend\r\nCinna warns him that Silla has spread the rumour of his death in\r\norder to win the hand of Junia; Cinna counsels him to meet her in a\r\nburial-place. Silla, whose suit has been repulsed by Junia, resolves\r\nto slay her. Cecilio awaits his betrothed in the dusky burial-place,\r\nsurrounded by the trophies of Roman heroes. She enters, accompanied by\r\nnoble youths and maidens, who call for vengeance on Silla, and lament by\r\nthe urn of her father. When she is alone, Cecilio reveals himself. She\r\ntakes him at first for a ghost, and they then express their joy in a\r\nduet.\r\n\r\nIn the second act Aufidio, Silla's evil counsellor, advises him publicly\r\nto declare Junia as his betrothed, and thereby reconcile the contending\r\nfactions; she will not be able to oppose the universal wish. Celia, his\r\nsister, who always counsels well, informs him of the ill-success of her\r\nappeal to Junia; he promises to unite Celia to her lover Cinna. Silla\r\nhas scarcely departed, when Cecilio rushes in to murder him in obedience\r\nto a vision; Cinna counsels postponement, to which Cecilio at last\r\nconsents. Ciàna is now so engrossed in his plans for revenge that he\r\nscarcely heeds Celia, who tells him of their approaching happiness, and\r\ntries to persuade Junia to a feigned submission, and the murder of Silla\r\nin his bed-chamber. But she refuses to be guilty of high treason, and he\r\nresolves to slay Silla himself.\r\n\r\nJunia, who declares that she will never give her hand to Silla, is\r\nthreatened with death, but nevertheless counsels Cecilio, who wishes to\r\navenge her, to remain in concealment. Celia seeks in vain to persuade\r\nher by the portrayal of her own happiness, but cannot stifle gloomy\r\n\r\n{\"LUCIO SILLA.\"}\r\n\r\n(179)\r\n\r\nanticipations. Silla announces from the capitol his intended union with\r\nJunia, and is answered by acclamations, but Junia endeavours to stab\r\nherself, which is prevented. Cecilio rushes in with drawn sword, is\r\ndisarmed, and his death on the following day decreed by Silla; Cinna,\r\nentering also with drawn sword, sees that his plot has failed, and\r\nfeigns to have come to Silla's protection. A terzet between Junia,\r\nCecilio, and Silla concludes the act.\r\n\r\nIn the third act Cecilio in fetters is informed by Cinna of the\r\nill-success of his plot, and calls on him for vengeance. Junia declares\r\nher resolve to slay herself before Cecilio. Aufidio comes to fetch him,\r\nand the lovers take leave.\r\n\r\nSilla declares before the assembled people that this day shall give him\r\nvengeance and his heart's desire. Junia accuses him as the mur» derer of\r\nher betrothed, and calls on the people to avenge her. Silla pardons her\r\nand Cecilio, and unites the loving pair. Seized with compunction Cinna\r\nreveals his plot against Silla; he, too, receives pardon and the hand of\r\nCelia. Finally Silla forgives Aufidio his evil counsels, lays down the\r\ndictatorship, and restores freedom to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of such a libretto as this renders comprehensible\r\nthe esteem in which Metastasio's texts were held. There is no trace\r\nof psychological study of motive; Silla, a sort of distorted Titus,\r\nalternates between cruelty and remorse, and finally empties a perfect\r\ncornucopia of generosity on to the stage; Junia too is unequal and\r\nweak. The situations are one and all as if purposely arranged to lead to\r\nnothing; the poet has with difficulty disposed the numerous scenes so\r\nas to introduce the necessary songs in their proper order. And the verse\r\nitself is very far removed from the grace and melody of Metastasio.\r\n\r\nThe score of the opera is preserved entire in Mozart's handwriting; it\r\nis in three parts, and has 610 pages. It contains besides the overture\r\ntwenty-three numbers, among them three choruses (6, 17, 23), one duet\r\n(7), and one terzet (18). No wonder that the composer paid court to\r\nthe singers! The mishap that deprived the opera of its tenor has been\r\nalready narrated (p. 142). As the part devolved in the end on a very\r\nunpractised singer, the greater part of it was omitted, leaving only\r\nwhat was necessary for the coherence of the plot. The two songs (5, 13)\r\nare written for a singer whose voice and execution do not rise above the\r\naverage, without any passages, and with a\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(180)\r\n\r\nmoderate compass; the more elaborate instrumentation alone betrays that\r\nthey are intended for a principal performer. Two other songs for Silla\r\nwhich are in the libretto were not composed at all, in order, no doubt,\r\nas Sonnleithner conjectures, to give the tenor as little as possible to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nAll the more stress is laid on the parts of De Amicis and Rauzzini.\r\nJunia has four songs, which are all for a singer of the first rank.\r\nThe special bravura song (II) is in the second act, \"Ah, se il crudel\r\nperiglio del caro ben ramento.\" Long passages of varied structure are\r\nhere the chief considerations. One example among many will serve to show\r\nthat Mozart was right in afterwards calling them \"dreadful\":--[See Page\r\nImage]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the bravura character of this song, its style is far\r\nfrom well defined; that of the entering song, \"Della sponde tenebrose\"\r\n(4), and of the third aria (16) is more marked. This last, \"Parto, m'\r\naffretto, ma nel partire il cor si spezza, mi manca la anima,\" consists\r\nof a continuous and progressive allegro assai. An agitated phrase for\r\nthe first violins--supported by an accompaniment for the second, runs\r\nthrough it almost without intermission; the harmonising is interesting\r\n\r\n{\"LUCIO SILLA\"--JUNIA.}\r\n\r\n(181)\r\n\r\nand varied; particularly effective is the immediate juxtaposition of\r\nmajor and minor keys; the whole song is strikingly expressive of an\r\nunsettled wavering mood.\r\n\r\nPassages such as--[See Page Image] are brilliant, but not, properly\r\nspeaking, characteristic. At least they do not stamp the actual\r\nsituation with individuality; they seem designed only to define the\r\ncharacter and mood of the acting personage in their main features, like\r\nthe masks of ancient tragedy. The more detailed analysis was left to\r\nthe art and individuality of the performer, to whom the composer offered\r\nonly the means of combining dramatic force with song. We can still\r\nrecognise the essential features of the characters; but we are quite\r\nunable to realise either the animation with which great artists inspired\r\nthem, or the effect they produced on the minds of contemporaries. It\r\nis a mistake to consider bravura and character as opposite terms;\r\nornamental passages are quite susceptible of characteristic expression,\r\nif they are delivered at the right time and in the right way. Junia's\r\nsongs express the character of a proud strong Roman woman, and an\r\nopportunity for dramatic analysis is offered to the performer even in\r\nthe more florid songs. But the true dramatic expression is undisturbed\r\nin Junia's last song (22), \"Fra i pensier più funesti di morte veder\r\nparmi l' esangue consorte.\" The long adagio, followed by an allegro,\r\nis a distinct foreshadowing of the later form. The treatment of the\r\norchestra too is significant. The flutes, oboes, and bassoons are in\r\nunison, and contrast with the stringed instruments, after a fashion not\r\nusual at the time: and in the allegro the orchestra is in significant\r\nopposition to the voice part, which is simple and unadorned, although\r\ncalculated to give due effect to a fine voice; its dramatic expression\r\nis quite excellent.\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(182)\r\n\r\nIn the part of Cecilio, written for Rauzzini, the regard paid to\r\nthe singer is very apparent both in the compass of the voice, which\r\ncomprises two octaves, and in the style. He was what may be called a\r\nscholarly singer, theoretically educated, and a composer himself, and\r\ndifficulties are introduced evidently with a view to this. Thus, for\r\ninstance, the recitative preceding his second aria is full of curious,\r\nsometimes harsh, turns and transitions in the harmonies; in the third\r\naria such jumps as the following occur--[See Page Image] requiring no\r\nsmall certainty of execution. The first song (2), introduced by a fine\r\nexpressive recitative, begins, as these male sopranos loved, with a\r\nlong-sustained note, and'contains various brilliant passages; but it is\r\nquite without original invention. The second song (9) expresses a\r\nproud, free mood with strength and animation; the last (21) can only be\r\nexplained as a freak of the performer. Cecilio, in the act of being led\r\nto execution, moved by Junia's tears, turns to her with the words--\r\n\r\n     Pupille amate\r\n     Non lagrimate!\r\n\r\nThese tender, trifling words, are treated by Mozart with an exquisite\r\ngrace which is quite foreign to the character and the situation of\r\nCecilio, and, as Sonnleithner observes, would be much more suitable to a\r\nsoubrette. Probably Rauzzini chose this way of ingratiating himself with\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nBesides the solo songs the opera contains a duet for J unia and Cecilio,\r\nand a terzet for the same and Silla, which are cleverly constructed,\r\nbut not otherwise remarkable. The duet (7) consists of an andante and a\r\nsomewhat tedious allegro, in which the voices go together for the most\r\npart in thirds or sixths, with little attempt at imitation. The terzet\r\n\r\n{\"LUCIO SILLA\"--ENSEMBLES.}\r\n\r\n(183)\r\n\r\nis well conceived. Each of the three voices has a characteristic motif,\r\nwhich is not elaborated, but set in contrast with the others; afterwards\r\nthe lovers are set in opposition to Silla, and the expression is\r\nheightened by occasional use of the three voices together; in short,\r\nsome traces are here discernible of the talent for musical architecture\r\nwhich Mozart afterwards displayed is so remarkable a degree.\r\n\r\nThe scene which precedes the close of the first act deserves special\r\nnotice; it is both conceived and executed with true dramatic force. In\r\na hall (atrium), decorated with the trophies of his ancestors, Cecilio\r\nawaits in the twilight the coming of Junia. The varied emotions roused\r\nin him by the contemplation of the graves of departed heroes, and\r\nthe yearnings of love, are graphically expressed in an accompanied\r\nrecitative. Junia appears, escorted by noble Romans of both sexes. The\r\nchorus calling on the spirits of the heroes for support and vengeance\r\nis serious to solemnity, with striking harmonies and an independent\r\ntreatment of parts, giving animation to the whole--an altogether\r\nexcellent piece of music, with much dramatic effect. Junia joins in with\r\na prayer to the shade of her father. The pain of a proud, strong spirit\r\nis expressed in a simple and dignified adagio, which gives a fine\r\nsoprano voice full scope for the display of its capabilities. The prayer\r\nis followed by a curse pronounced on Silla by the chorus, powerful and\r\nanimated, and a fitting close to this truly dramatic musical scene.\r\nA resemblance to the first chorus in Gluck's \"Orfeo,\" pointed out\r\nby Sonnleithner, is too slight to be considered more than a mere\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nAmong the secondary parts that of Celia has the most independence of\r\ncharacter. Her two first songs (3 and 10) are, on the whole, simple and\r\ngraceful, especially the second. Passages in Cinna's three songs (1,\r\n12, 20) and in the air for the second tenor, Aufidio, are calculated\r\nto display the powers of the artists, but the songs, as a whole, have\r\nlittle or no individuality.\r\n\r\nThere are two choruses besides that which we have noted, but neither\r\nof them are so impressive. In the second act Silla's appearance on the\r\ncapitol is greeted by a chorus which\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(184)\r\n\r\nis powerful, and supported by a running accompaniment. The last act is\r\nbrought to a conclusion by a chorus, alternating with the solo voices,\r\nbut the movement is unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe overture consists of the usual three movements (Molto allegro 4-4,\r\nAndante 2-4, Molto allegro 3-8), and pretends to no connection with the\r\nopera itself, being altogether after the ordinary pattern. The treatment\r\nof the orchestra is not unusual. Trumpets are frequently used, and\r\nsometimes kettledrums; but this is of little moment--more interesting is\r\nthe fact that the wind instruments are often freer and less subordinate\r\nto the strings than usual. An attempt is evident to render the\r\naccompaniment full and lively; the second violins have characteristic\r\nand occasionally imitative passages. But these are merely attempts;\r\nthe influence of the traditional form overpowers all endeavours after\r\na freer method; it displays itself in many mechanical habits, as, for\r\ninstance, in the harmonic turn which almost invariably precedes the\r\nsingers' cadenzas:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThe two festival operas composed in 1771 and 1772 belong in essentials\r\nto the opera seria, but were subject to certain special rules. The festa\r\n(azione) teatrale, also called serenata, were arranged with immediate\r\nreference to the person in whose honour they were given. They were\r\nusually also allegorical, the advantage of this kind of poetry being\r\nthat it was capable of expressing more or less open flattery. A pastoral\r\ncharacter was almost always given to the treatment of the old myths,\r\nso that the dramatic element was thrown into the background, and the\r\nbrilliancy of the entertainment was left to depend principally on the\r\nmagnificent costumes and scenery. The musical treatment became more\r\nopenly and unreservedly undramatic, and the composer was satisfied with\r\naffording a means of display to the singers. The serenata was in the\r\ntraditional three acts, but not bound by the scenic divisions of the\r\nopera\r\n\r\n{\"ASCANIO IN ALBA,\" 1771.}\r\n\r\n(185)\r\n\r\nseria; as it originally served as an interlude to other festivities,\r\nit was usually also shorter. As a rule, it was only performed once; and\r\ntook the second rank after the opera seria.[4] It was on this account\r\nthat the festival piece was intrusted to young Mozart, the opera to\r\nHasse.\r\n\r\nIn \"Ascanio in Alba\" (111 K.) Parini[5] had endeavoured to produce\r\na work worthy of a festivity such as the marriage of the Archduke\r\nFerdinand with the Duchess Marie Beatrice d'Este. Divinities, heroes,\r\nand shepherds form the dramatis persona, and there are abundant\r\nchoruses, ballets, and spectacular effects, with no lack of flattering\r\nby-play. The programme will serve to show what distinguished artists[6]\r\nwere engaged to represent this piece:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nVenus, preceded and accompanied by a chorus of genü and graces, descends\r\nfrom heaven with her grandson Ascanio, and informs him that she desires\r\nto unite him with Silvia, a lovely and virtuous nymph of this her\r\nbeloved land. Silvia is of the race of Hercules, and Cupid having caused\r\nher to see Ascanio in a vision, she already glows with secret love for\r\nhim. Ascanio is filled with joy, and being counselled by Venus to\r\nprove Silvia's constancy before declaring himself to her, he expresses\r\nimpatience at this postponement of his happiness. Fauno comes to the\r\nsacrifice with a chorus of shepherds, and reverently extols the\r\ngoodness of Venus to the country and the people. Silvia then draws near,\r\naccompanied by Aceste and a chorus of nymphs and shepherds. The priest\r\nAceste informs Silvia, whom he has brought up, that Venus herself\r\nintends to unite her to Ascanio, and to found a new city with their\r\nprogeny, and expresses his\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(186)\r\n\r\njoy in a long aria. Silvia is amazed, and declares her love for the\r\nyouth whom she has seen in her dreams; Aceste consoles her by saying\r\nthat Venus must have sent the dreams, and she in her turn sings a long\r\nsong denoting her joy. After all have retired to prepare the sacrifice\r\nAscanio declares in an aria his delight with the charming Silvia; but\r\nVenus exacts that he shall yet make trial of her virtue.\r\n\r\nA ballet follows this act, in which the nymphs and graces astonish\r\nthe shepherds by changing the grove into a splendid temple, the first\r\nbuilding of the newly founded city.\r\n\r\nSilvia beholds this new erection with admiration, and utters her longing\r\nfor the yet unknown beloved, in which she is supported by a chorus of\r\nshepherdesses. When Ascanio appears she recognises her lover in him; but\r\nas he feigns not to know her, she remains doubtful, and Fauno confirms\r\nher in the error that it is not he; she swoons. Ascanio laments that\r\nhe cannot show himself in his true form, and departs, whereupon she\r\nrevives, and makes known her anguish and determination to remain true\r\nto her duty in a long recitative and aria. Then he returns, and throws\r\nhimself at her feet. She repulses him with the words, \"Io son d'\r\nAscanio,\" and flees, which gives him opportunity for a song full of\r\ntender admiration. Aceste, to whom she confides all, praises her for\r\nher virtue. Venus appears with the chorus of nymphs and shepherds, and\r\npresents Ascanio to Silvia as her spouse. After the lovers and Aceste\r\nhave announced their joy in a terzet, Venus exhorts the young rulers to\r\nfulfil their duties faithfully to their subjects, and ascends to Olympus\r\namong the expressions of gratitude uttered by Aceste in the name of the\r\npeople; and a joyful chorus brings the whole to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe description which Fauno gives of the guardian divinity of the\r\ncountry, and the address of Aceste to Venus as she departs, contain so\r\nmany allusions to Maria Theresa that non-recognition was impossible.\r\nSilvia too, of the race of Hercules (the name of Ercole was common in\r\nthe family of D'Este), the pupil of Minerva and the muses, the pattern\r\nof virtue and modesty, is undoubtedly the Princess Beatrice, whose\r\nintellect, literary cultivation, and amiability were universally\r\nadmired.[7] There was less to be said of the Archduke Ferdinand; nothing\r\ncould be made of him but a fair youth with rosy cheeks. It is worthy\r\nof note that although mutual liking founded on beauty and spiritual\r\nendowments is highly extolled, yet, as became a royal wedding, the\r\nsubjection of inclination to duty is made the\r\n\r\n{\"ASCANIO IN ALBA,\" 1771.}\r\n\r\n(187)\r\n\r\ntheme of highest praise. The union had not been consummated without\r\ndifficulty,[8] and some anxiety was felt as to the relations of the\r\nyoung couple.\r\n\r\n\"The Archduke and his wife are well and very happy,\" writes L. Mozart,\r\n\"which must be a great satisfaction to Her Majesty the Empress, because\r\nit was feared that he would not think much of his wife, she not being\r\nbeautiful; but she is uncommonly amiable, pleasant and virtuous,\r\nconsequently beloved by every one, and she has quite captivated the\r\nArchduke, for she has the best heart and the most engaging manners in\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nThe original score, in two volumes of 480 pages, is preserved: it\r\ncontains twenty-two numbers. At the close of the first act we have\r\nthe bass part of the ballet in nine numbers, written by a copyist,\r\nand affixed, doubtless as a guide to the conductor. L. Mozart writes\r\nexpressly that the ballet which connects the two acts was to be composed\r\nby Wolfgang (September 7, 1771); there must have been a special score\r\nfor the manager of the ballet which has not been preserved.\r\n\r\nWe cannot help wondering that Hasse should have founded his prophecy\r\nof Mozart's future greatness on this opera, for it seems to us less\r\noriginal than its predecessors. It certainly displays talent and\r\nassurance, but there is not an original idea in any of the fourteen\r\nsongs to be compared with those of the former operas. The accompanied\r\nrecitatives do not arrest attention, the most animated among them being\r\nthe recitative (13) in which the lovers, seeing each other for the first\r\ntime, express their agitation in asides. Contrary to custom, the wind\r\ninstruments are employed in the recitative; but otherwise the treatment\r\nof the orchestra calls for no remark. One song of Silvia's (11) is\r\naccompanied by four horns (two in G, two in D) without any singular\r\neffects; the last song of Ascanio (18) has, besides horns, bassoons and\r\nflutes, two serpentini (in F), instruments which, Schindler suggests,\r\nresembled the English horn.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent among the singers was Manzuoli, for whose part Mozart\r\nnow applied the instruction he had\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(188)\r\n\r\nformerly received from him in London (p. 41). It is written for a\r\nmezzo-soprano, keeps always to the middle notes, and has no passages\r\nat all; only here and there easy embellishments. The simple lingering\r\nmelody is not without feeling, which, however, never rises to passion.\r\nThe first song (2) begins with a long-sustained note, whilst the last\r\nresembles those in \"Lucio Silla\" in its tender playful grace.\r\n\r\nThere is more variety in the part composed for Maria Ant.\r\nGirelli-Aguilar, who sang in Gluck's \"Aristeo\" and \"Orfeo\" in Parma\r\n(1769). The first cavatina (7) is simple, graceful, and complete\r\nin design and treatment; two others (8, 11) are bravura songs, with\r\nbrilliant passages, the melody having an air of dignity, which is also\r\napparent in the last song (16), both in the adagio and the allegro.\r\n\r\nGius. Tibaldi, whom Gluck had summoned to Vienna, where in 1767 he sang\r\nthe part of Admetus[9] in \"Alceste,\" was already in years, and his voice\r\npast its prime; his two songs (6, 19) are adorned with long passages,\r\nwhich imply a very fluent singer.\r\n\r\nIn the closing terzet (21) the voices are at first contrasted in\r\ndetached characteristic motifs; but afterwards the soprano and tenor\r\nare grouped together with alternating passages, while Manzuoli's part\r\nretains its simplicity of character.\r\n\r\nOf the two secondary characters, to each of whom two songs were\r\nassigned, it is to be noted that they have a higher compass than the\r\nprincipal singers. Their songs, too, are richly provided with passages;\r\nbut their character is perceptibly subordinate.\r\n\r\nThe choruses, seven in number, were a great ornament to the piece.\r\nThey do not interfere with the action, and five are in connection with\r\ndances. Also in the overture, on the conclusion of the first animated\r\nallegro, the second movement changes into a dance \"of eleven females,\"\r\nas L. Mozart writes, \"either eight nymphs and three graces, or eight\r\ngraces and three goddesses,\" and instead of the third\r\n\r\n{\"ASCANIO IN ALBA\"--CHORUSES.}\r\n\r\n(189)\r\n\r\nmovement[10] a chorus of nymphs and graces with corresponding ballet is\r\nintroduced, the orchestra retaining the character of a third movement\r\nof the overture, and the voices (four or two-part) filling out the\r\nharmonies after the manner of wind instruments, but in a freer, more\r\nflowing style. The chorus is repeated on both occasions when Venus\r\nascends to heaven. Most of the other choruses are also repeated like\r\nrefrains on appropriate occasions; the second (3) is given six times.\r\nIt is in two parts, for tenor and bass, and remarkable for its\r\naccompaniment of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons (and violon-celli), 2\r\nhorns, and double-bass, but not otherwise original. The following chorus\r\n(5), introduced by a short intrada, which announces Silvia's approach\r\n(four-part, but interrupted by two short three-part movements) is\r\nblithe and animated. The accompaniment has an independent passage in\r\ndance-measure for the violins; the voices move with spirit and freedom.\r\nThe second act begins with two female choruses. The first, two-part\r\n(12), acquaints Silvia of the approach of her lover, and is lively and\r\nfresh; the two voices alternate easily in imitative phrases.\r\n\r\nStill more animated is the next three-part chorus (17), when, Silvia\r\nhaving repulsed Ascanio and fled, the chorus express surprise in a short\r\nimitative movement addressed to Venus. The following chorus (20), which\r\nis repeated three times, has simple harmonies, but is powerful and\r\neffective. The concluding chorus (22) is effectively worked up after the\r\nmanner of the first into a quick animated movement, followed by a full\r\nballet.\r\n\r\nThe choruses, heightened by the scenic arrangements, must have\r\ncontributed greatly to the success of the opera. They display so much\r\nfreedom and assurance, such perfect mastery of method in order to attain\r\nthe truest effect, that perhaps it was here that Hasse recognised the\r\nfootprints of the lion.\r\n\r\nThe second festival piece, composed in honour of the\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(190)\r\n\r\nnewly elected Archbishop Hieronymus in 1772, was Metas-tasio's \"Sogno\r\ndi Scipione\" (126 K.), an allegorical poem in one act, on a classical\r\nmodel.[11]\r\n\r\nTo the younger Scipio, asleep in the Palace of Massinissa, appear\r\nSteadfastness (Costanza) and Fortuna, and require him to decide which of\r\nthe two he will choose for his guide through life. On his demanding\r\ntime for consideration, Fortuna depicts in a song her fleeting, unstable\r\nnature. Costanza answers his question as to where he is by telling\r\nhim he is in heaven, instructs him on the harmony of the spheres, and\r\ninforms him that he is in that region of heaven where his departed\r\nancestors abide. These approach him in a chorus, and from their midst\r\nsteps out the elder Scipio Africanus, who acquaints him with the\r\nimmortality of the soul, and the reward of the good in another life.\r\nThen Scipio's father, Emilius Paulus, draws near; he shows him the earth\r\nas a little point in boundless space, and warns him of the nothingness\r\nof all earthly things in comparison to the heavenly. Struck by this,\r\nScipio wishes at once to leave earth and remain with his forefathers,\r\nbut Africanus refuses, telling him that he is destined to save Rome, and\r\nthat he must therefore tarry on earth, and earn by his great deeds the\r\nreward of immortality. Africanus refuses also to influence by his advice\r\nScipio's choice between the two goddesses, who now demand his decision.\r\nFortuna, who has more than once expressed her impatience, again depicts\r\nher omnipotence, which Costanza opposes with a representation of her\r\nvictorious strength. On Scipio's declaring himself in favour of the\r\nlatter, Fortuna threatens him with her heaviest penalties, the dazzling\r\napparition disappears, a tremendous storm breaks forth, and Scipio\r\nawakes in the Palace of Massinissa, and declares himself true to\r\nCostanza.\r\n\r\nThe allusions to the circumstances under which the piece was first\r\nproduced on October 1, 1735--the birthday of Charles VI., who had\r\nsuffered severe defeats in Italy--are evident enough, especially in the\r\nspeeches of Africanus and Costanza. Nevertheless, the Licenza comes at\r\nthe conclusion, making a direct address to the hero of the occasion,\r\nand winding up with a formal congratulation in the form of an aria and\r\nchorus.\r\n\r\n{SOGNO DI SCIPIONE,\" 1772.}\r\n\r\n(191)\r\n\r\nThis occasional piece was considered by the Salzburg authorities to be\r\na suitable greeting to the new Archbishop without any alteration,\r\napparently on account of its philosophic moral reflections, and it may\r\nindeed be considered as a good example of the dramatic treatment of such\r\nreflections.[12] Dramatic the treatment can hardly be called; it is a\r\nkind of concert in costume. It is difficult to comprehend how Scipio can\r\nact or sing songs while he is supposed to be dreaming; yet Metastasio\r\nmakes him awake from his dream at the end of the piece.[13]\r\n\r\nMozart's composition, of which the original score, in one volume of 315\r\npages, is preserved, has more of a concert character than any other of\r\nhis dramatic works of the period. It keeps strictly within the customary\r\nlimits, and is poor in original invention, giving just the impression of\r\nwork done to order; the score bears traces also of great haste.\r\n\r\nThe overture closes with the second and slower movement, which prepares\r\nthe scene for the slumbering Scipio by a change from the principal key\r\nof D major to E major, and a _decrescendo_ to _pp_.[14] This, and the\r\naccompanied recitative, that closes with the storm in the midst of\r\nwhich Scipio returns to earth, are the only dramatic or characteristic\r\nmovements. It is curious that the opportunity for an obbligato\r\nrecitative (for instance, at the description of the harmony of the\r\nspheres) is never taken advantage of; the long speeches are all in plain\r\nrecitative.\r\n\r\nNot one of the ten songs has any dramatic characterisation; even the\r\nparts of Fortuna and Costanza do not offer any marked contrast. Each\r\nof them has two songs--one freely conceived in a broad style, with full\r\norchestral accompaniments, the other of smaller design, and both richly\r\nprovided with high passages. First, Fortuna sings her principal song\r\n(2), and Costanza her shorter one (3); afterwards the case is\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS.}\r\n\r\n(192)\r\n\r\nreversed (8, 9); but the character, pitch, and formation of the songs\r\ndiffer so little that apart from the words they might easily be mistaken\r\nthe one for the other. There is a second composition of the Licenza\r\nin existence, pointing by its handwriting, firm structure, and the\r\nindependence and delicate treatment of the orchestra, to a considerably\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\nThe three Roman heroes all sing tenor. Africanus has a great bravura\r\nsong (5), with passages as high as C in alt; his second is quieter and\r\nsimpler, and makes an attempt at characterisation; the image of the\r\nrock, standing immovable in the sea, is sketched in sober colours. The\r\nsong of Emilius Paulus has a kind of dance measure, not very lively, and\r\nreminding us of a polonaise; the words \"un fanciullin che piange\" are\r\nillustrated by a chromatic scale. Finally, Scipio has two bravura songs\r\n(1, 10) with many passages, the second being remarkable for its length.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, most of the songs are of great length, and introduced by\r\nlong ritomelli. Where there is no distinct second part, the Da capo\r\ncomes into use; the middle movements are short and lightly treated. The\r\norchestra displays some freedom and independence, but is not equal to\r\n\"Ascanio.\"\r\n\r\nThe two choruses are of the usual opera type. The first (4), in which\r\nScipio is greeted by his ancestors, is not without power and dignity,\r\nbut it has no characterisation, and is almost throughout in harmony;\r\nonly once the voices make an attempt during a few bars at independent\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nIn the concluding chorus (12) the voices complete the harmony in the\r\nusual way to a running accompaniment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Leop. v.

ORATORIO.\r\n\r\nTHE commonly received opinion[1] that the oratorio originated in the\r\ndevotional exercises held in the oratories of monasteries,\r\n\r\n{ORIGIN OF ORATORIO.}\r\n\r\n(193)\r\n\r\nand thrown into the form of a musical drama by Filippo Neri (1515-1595),\r\nis without foundation. All that can confidently be asserted is that he\r\ncaused _laudi spirituali_, a kind of motett,[2] to be sung by way\r\nof recreation, and that he organised carnival performances\r\n(\"rappresentazioni\") which withdrew the mind from worldly follies;[3]\r\nwhether, and in what degree, music had to do with these we do not\r\nknow.[4]\r\n\r\nThe \"Rappresentazione dell' Anima e del Corpo,\" by Emilio de' Cavalieri,\r\nwho sought to reproduce the old tragedy on the same principles as Peri\r\nin the opera, was arranged for representation on a stage (\"palco\"),\r\nwith scenery, costumes, and dances, and contained recitatives and\r\nchoruses.[5] One performance took place, according to the preface to the\r\nscore, in February, 1599, in the oratorium of the church of S. Maria,\r\nin Vallicella,[6] and this Della Valle remembered having attended when a\r\nboy.[7] Henceforward sacred dialogues and\r\n\r\n{ORATORIO.}\r\n\r\n(194)\r\n\r\ndramas set to music were frequent in Rome and elsewhere, and were given\r\nnot only before the congregation _dell' oratorio_,[8] but in churches,\r\nmonasteries, and palaces. The history of the development of these\r\nrappresentazione or azione sacra, also called oratorio,[9] has not yet\r\nbeen traced in detail.[10]\r\n\r\nIn time the performances were confined to Lent, when no opera was\r\ngiven, and although action and costume gradually disappeared from the\r\nchurches,[11] and the whole assumed more and more the form of a concert,\r\nyet the dramatic element, or at least the dialogue, always remained.\r\n\r\nThe connection with the service of the church was so far maintained that\r\na mass and an address from a boy preceded the oratorio, and a sermon was\r\ndelivered between its two parts.[12]\r\n\r\nThe growth of the azione sacra kept pace with that of the opera seria.\r\n\r\nApostolo Zeno defined the form of the oratorio by giving it unity of\r\naction, time and place, and strict dramatic treatment, and Metastasio\r\ncarried on and completed the work just as he had done in the opera.\r\nIts division was into two, not three parts, otherwise the arrangement\r\ncorresponded altogether with that of the opera. The characters enter\r\nspeaking; recitative is employed for the dialogue, and the airs serve\r\n\r\n{\"LA BETULIA LIBBRATA,\" 1773.}\r\n\r\n(195)\r\n\r\nto express the higher emotions; concerted songs occur but seldom, but\r\nthe choruses are frequent, and more often form a part of the action than\r\nin the opera.\r\n\r\nThe subject-matter is borrowed from the Bible, generally the Old\r\nTestament, or from some old legend; but both persons and plot must of\r\nnecessity be devised, so as to represent the story in a succession of\r\ndialogues. An effort is made to preserve the biblical diction in the\r\npoetry, but the animated rhetorical style of Italian poetry decidedly\r\ngets the upper hand. Moral and religious reflections are the almost\r\ninvariable themes of the songs and choruses, which have rarely any\r\nindividual character. In this respect, as well as in the dearth of\r\ndramatic action, the azione sacra comes nearer to the so-called azione\r\nteatrale than to the genuine opera seria.\r\n\r\nThe legend of Judith is treated as follows by Metastasio, in his\r\noratorio \"La Betulia Liberata,\" which has often been composed.[13]The\r\n_dramatis persona_ (\"interlocutori\") are:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nOzia reproaches the desponding inhabitants of Bethulia for their\r\ncowardice, and declares his resolution not to give up the city to the\r\nenemy. Amital and Cabri oppose him, describing the sufferings of the\r\npeople from famine and sickness. In vain he reminds them how the Lord\r\nhas helped their fathers, they demand admission to Holofernes, and it is\r\nwith difficulty that he obtains a delay of five days, and calls upon God\r\nfor help, with the chorus. Then Judith enters; horrified at\r\n\r\n{ORATORIO.}\r\n\r\n(196)\r\n\r\nthe decision, she upbraids them for their cowardice which dares to doubt\r\nGod's mercy and set a limit to His power: \"il primo è vile, temerario\r\nil secondo.\" Her song (5) may serve as a standard for the style of this\r\npoetry:\r\n\r\n     Del pari infeconda\r\n     D' un flume è la sponda,\r\n     Se torbido eccede,\r\n     Se manca d' amor.\r\n     Si acqaista baldanza\r\n     Per troppo speranza,\r\n     Si perde la fede\r\n     Per troppo rumor.\r\n\r\nShe exhorts the trembling people to trust and patience, and informs them\r\nthat she has formed a great resolve, which as yet she can communicate\r\nto no one; while she prepares herself, all are to unite in prayer;\r\nthe former chorus is repeated. Carmi brings Achior as a prisoner, who\r\nrelates that, having told Holofemes of the courage of the Israelites and\r\nthe wonderful power of their God, who renders them invincible as long\r\nas they trust in Him, he has been sent into the city to share its\r\ndestruction. Judith approaching, is left alone with Ozia, who is\r\nsurprised to see her richly adorned; she demands egress from the town\r\nwith her maid, and departs, the chorus (in the distance) expressing\r\nastonishment at her enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the second part Ozia seeks to convince the heathen Achior that there\r\nis but one God. Before his arguments have been quite successful Amital\r\nenters and describes the death-stillness, expressive of the extreme\r\nof need and despair, which hangs over the city. Shrieks and tumult\r\ninterrupt him; Judith returns, and relates how she has slain Holofernes;\r\nshe holds the decapitated head before the incredulous Achior, who swoons\r\nfor fear. After Judith's song, he comes to himself and declares his\r\nconversion to the faith of the God of Abraham. Carmi enters, and relates\r\nthat at Judith's bidding they had raised a war-cry; the Assyrians,\r\ndiscovering the death of Holofernes, were seized with terror and fled\r\nprecipitately.\r\n\r\nA song of thanksgiving to God, in which Judith leads the chorus, forms\r\nthe conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe composers treated the oratorio in the same way as the opera\r\nseria,[14] only that the want of dramatic variety favoured the adoption\r\nof the concert style of music. In its form there was no important\r\ndifference; we find the same treatment of the recitatives, secco and\r\nobbligato, of the songs and of all important parts, including the\r\nchoruses; only\r\n\r\n{\"BETULIA\"--OVERTURE.}\r\n\r\n(197)\r\n\r\nthat the bass voice is made use of in solo singing. We might expect to\r\nfind the musical conceptions inspired by earnestness and reverence;\r\nand this was so far the case that the oratorio excluded all that was\r\ntrifling, voluptuous, or that related to the passion of love. But a\r\nreligious tone was entirely wanting, and the operatic style was only\r\nmodified, not essentially altered. Every song in an oratorio would have\r\nbeen quite in place at a corresponding point in an opera seria, and many\r\noperatic songs might have been transferred to an oratorio with perfect\r\npropriety. The bravura of the vocalists was considered as appropriate in\r\nthe churches as on the stage, only that a certain amount of moderation\r\nwas becoming.\r\n\r\nDuring Lent, when the opera was closed, the public looked for\r\nentertainment to the oratorios, and flattered themselves that they were\r\nat the same time fulfilling a religious duty, because the performance\r\ntook place in a church.\r\n\r\nMozart's music to \"Betulia Liberata\" (118 K.) is quite on this level.\r\nThere are unfortunately no indications of time or place on the original\r\nscore, which exists in two volumes of 382 pages and fifteen numbers; the\r\nhandwriting and composition place it undoubtedly between 1770 and 1773.\r\nAs we know that Mozart received a commission for an oratorio at Padua\r\nin March, 1771, it may safely be conjectured that this was the \"Betulia\r\nLiberata,\" and that it was performed in Padua in 1772.[15]\r\n\r\nThe three movements of the overture in D minor are quiet and more\r\nconcentrated than usual; the arrangement of the parts is more\r\nindependent, with attempts at imitative treatment. Besides oboes and\r\nbassoons, there are four horns (in D and F), and trumpets (in D), used\r\nfrequently and in the same manner as at present.\r\n\r\n{ORATORIO.}\r\n\r\n(198)\r\n\r\nA secco recitative follows the overture; the music never rises above the\r\ndialogue, with its long, sermonising speeches and rhetorical bombastic\r\nreflections. There are only two accompanied recitatives: the first\r\noccurs when Judith upbraids the people; short and skilfully modulated\r\ninstrumental phrases interrupt the animated declamation, and the whole\r\nis lively and expressive. Later on Judith delivers the long narrative\r\nof her adventure with Holofemes (II) in an accompanied recitative.\r\nThe stringed instruments strike the chord in a high pitch, with which\r\nJudith's alto voice strongly contrasts. There are but few agitated\r\npassages; but, indeed, even in stirring moments the music never reaches\r\nanything like characterisation. The prayer of Judith at the most\r\ncritical point of the piece is not conspicuous either for tunefulness or\r\nvaried accompaniment.\r\n\r\nThe solo parts are distributed among all the four voices: for Amital,\r\nCabri and Carmi are soprani, Judith alto, Ozia tenor, and Achior bass;\r\nthey are never united in an ensemble, and there is not one duet.\r\n\r\nJudith has three airs, besides a solo with chorus. The first (5)\r\napproaches as near as possible to a bravura song. The words are\r\nexpressed with grace and animation. The passages are neither predominant\r\nnor tedious, which is doubtless due in part to the singer for whom the\r\npart was composed, for the second song (7), powerful and dignified as\r\nit is, is also without passages; it begins with the favourite\r\nlong-sustained note. The chief movement of the last song (11)--a long\r\nadagio with a carefully composed accompaniment--is finely descriptive\r\nof Judith's mood, but there is no appeal to the feelings by beautiful\r\nmelody. The whole part is not bravura in the strictest sense; the deeper\r\nalto notes are only occasionally employed.\r\n\r\nThat this moderation of style was not inseparable from the character\r\nof oratorio music, may be seen from the parts of Amital and Ozia. The\r\nsecond song for Amital (10) and the first for Ozia (1) are regular\r\nserious bravura songs, with passages, long-sustained notes, and florid\r\naccompaniments. Amital's last song (13) is solemn and earnest, to suit\r\nthe words, but still keeps the performer well in view; Ozia's\r\n\r\n{\"BETULIA\"--ARIE, CHORUSES.}\r\n\r\n(199)\r\n\r\nsecond song is soft and graceful, and the first which reminds us of\r\nMozart's later style.\r\n\r\nThe bass part of Achior is less carefully written, and not nearly so\r\nbravura in style. The first song (6) is more noisy than vigorous, both\r\nin voice and accompaniment. This boisterous treatment of the bass voice\r\nwas then common, and it was on that account excluded from the opera\r\nseria.[16] In this place it accords with the dread apparition of\r\nHolofernes which is described. The second song of Achior, after his\r\nconversion (12), is very simple and insignificant; the accompaniment is\r\npartly imitative.\r\n\r\nThe two airs of Cabri (2) and Carmi (14) are, as usual with secondary\r\nparts, simple, and not without expression, but in no way original.\r\n\r\nThe traditional aria form is adhered to in almost all the songs. The\r\nsecond part, distinct from the first in composition if not in time and\r\nmeasure, is short and superficially treated; generally only the last\r\npart of the first movement is repeated. The latter is broadly conceived,\r\nwith long ritomelli; the invariable cadenza is brought in in the usual\r\nway. The accompaniment resembles that of operatic songs, but is\r\nmore carefully worked out. Original passages for the second\r\nviolins--sometimes, too, for the violas--occur, here and there, as well\r\nas attempts at imitation; and the wind instruments are occasionally\r\nemployed independently. All these attempts show decided talent, but\r\nthey are few and far between, and the orchestra has not the stamp of\r\nindependent vigour.\r\n\r\nThe choruses, although occupying more space in the composition, do not\r\nmaterially differ from those of the opera. The concluding chorus of the\r\nfirst part (8) is like a study for a recitative, turned into a chorus\r\nby means of the accompaniment, which consists of two alternate strongly\r\nmarked subjects. The elaboration is not contrapuntal, but\r\n\r\n{ORATORIO.}\r\n\r\n(200)\r\n\r\nharmonic, and a simple but rich modulation gives significance to the\r\nmovement. The voices give the full harmony, and a moderate amount of\r\nagitation in the melody and rhythm appears when the declamation demands\r\nit. The favourable pitch, the interesting modulation, the characteristic\r\naccompaniments, and the dignified seriousness which runs through the\r\nwhole, all combine to make this chorus effective and excellent of its\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe two other choruses are prayers connected with solos. The first (4)\r\nis very simple. Ozia sings a melodious, beautifully conceived cantilene,\r\nfull of feeling, which is accompanied by the violins pizzicato, and the\r\nchorus ends with a repetition of the two last lines. The second verse,\r\nwith a change of composition, preserves the same character; after which\r\nthe first is repeated, and leads with effective climax to a full close.\r\n\r\nThe last chorus is more grandly conceived. Judith answers the\r\nthanksgiving of the chorus in two strophes descriptive of the victory,\r\nand then the chorus falls in again; this is repeated three times, and\r\na moral reflection follows as a closing chorus. Mozart has chosen an\r\nancient church melody for the refrain of the chorus:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThe melody is four-part, the partially varied harmony dignified and\r\npowerful, and interesting in its simplicity; the voices are well treated\r\nand animated. At the fourth\r\n\r\n{\"BETULIA\"--COMPARISON WITH HASSE.}\r\n\r\n(201)\r\n\r\nrepetition Mozart has assigned the Cantus firmus, somewhat altered in\r\nthe second part, to the tenor voice:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThence he passes to the closing chorus. The solo part of Judith, simple,\r\ndignified, and earnest, resembles a regular song; but the declamatory is\r\nmore prominent than the melodious element. Although somewhat overpowered\r\nby the chorus, the character of Judith is here most significantly\r\nexpressed. Whenever Mozart allows himself free play, he exhibits\r\noriginality, truth, and earnestness.\r\n\r\nThe closing chorus is lively and brilliant, but kept in moderation, and\r\nits character is not without strength and dignity.\r\n\r\nThat this conception of the oratorio was not peculiar to Mozart, but was\r\nthe then commonly received one, is plain from a comparison of this with\r\nother contemporary oratorios--with those, for instance, by Hasse, which\r\nare reckoned among his most important works. Whoever should form, on\r\nthe strength of the eulogies pronounced by Hiller on the oratorio\r\n\"Sant-Elena al Calvario,\"[17] a conception of this\r\n\r\n{ORATORIO.}\r\n\r\n(202)\r\n\r\nand similar pieces founded on our present ideas of sacred music, would\r\nfind himself much deceived. Here, as in all Hasse's oratorios, the\r\nart of the vocalist is the determining element, and the expression of\r\nemotion coincides in essentials with that of the opera. The differences\r\nin Mozart's oratorio are unimportant, and are founded on variations in\r\nthe taste of the time and of the composer.\r\n\r\nHiller speaks with great admiration of the pilgrims' chorus, to which\r\nHasse has set the chorale \"O Lamb of God\" in such a way \"that its whole\r\nattraction consists in the alternation of the voices and of the various\r\ninstruments among whom the melody is divided; the bass and violin are\r\nin unison throughout, and give animation to the whole, with a simplicity\r\nthat is worth more than ten fugues, and which betrays more insight into\r\nthe true beauty of song than the most artistic counterpoint.\" It almost\r\nseems as if Hiller wished to point at J. S. Bach, and remembering some\r\nof the marvellous creations of Bach--for instance, the first chorus in\r\nthe St. Matthew \"Passion Music\"--the contrast between different artistic\r\ntendencies and personalities can hardly be better exemplified than by\r\ncomparing him and Hasse. Hasse has succeeded in bringing the chorale\r\ninto accordance with the Italian style of his oratorio, but he loses\r\nthereby the proper significance and effect of the chorale. The way in\r\nwhich Mozart has introduced the Catholic church melodies unaltered is,\r\nfrom this point of view, grander and more striking. And Hasse was looked\r\nupon in Mozart's day as a representative of the good old times in the\r\ntraditions of which he had been educated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Winterfeld, Gabrieli, II., p. 146.

OPERA BUFFA.\r\n\r\nOPERA BUFFA was a gradual outgrowth from the opera seria, in which\r\noriginally comic characters took part in burlesque scenes.\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(203)\r\n\r\nEven so late as 1718, when Scarlatti's \"Telemacco\" was produced,\r\nthere were scenes of coarse humour between Tersite and Silvina in\r\nthis otherwise conventionally correct opera.[1] When, however, the\r\ndiscrepancy between these and the dignity and purity of the opera seria\r\ncame to be fully felt, the comic scenes were detached, generally\r\nwithout much difficulty, and given as independent additions, between the\r\nacts.[2] It had long been the custom to interpose between the acts of\r\nthe spoken drama--tragedies as well as comedies--musical representations\r\nwhich had no connection with the piece itself, and were called intermedi\r\nor intermezzi, and in the opera both the comic scenes and the ballets\r\nwere gradually loosed from their connection with the main body of the\r\nwork and placed between the acts. The relish of the audience for these\r\ncomic interludes soon led to the production of independent comic pieces\r\ncalled intermezzi, which took the place of the disjointed scenes from\r\nthe opera. As a rule there were but two characters, one male and one\r\nfemale, and there was no continuous plot even when the same characters\r\nappeared in the different intermezzi. The dialogue was carried on in\r\nplain recitative, and there were neither solo songs nor duets\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(204)\r\n\r\nto interfere with the main opera. In the intermezzi which Metastasio\r\nhimself composed for his \"Didone Abbandonata\" in 1724, the characters\r\nare Ribbio, a poet, composer, singer, and impresario, who is desirous\r\nof establishing a theatre on the Canary Islands, and Dorina, the prima\r\ndonna whom he wishes to engage; after many affectations she sings a song\r\nbefore him, whereupon he produces others, of his own composition, and\r\nthey vie with each other in mutual compliments. In the second intermezzo\r\nDorina, dressed for the stage, displays her tragic powers to Ribbio as\r\nCleopatra; finally they conclude a romantic contract, which includes a\r\nprospect of tender relations between the two.\r\n\r\nGreat effect was caused by the caricaturing and ridiculing of the opera\r\nseria, and by the exposure of the personal relations of stage heroes and\r\nheroines; elements which have always played a great part in opera buffa.\r\n\r\nThe intermezzo gives, as it were, the back view of the opera seria,\r\nnot with the intention of destroying the ideal effect by sarcastic\r\ncriticism, but rather in order to heighten it by force of contrast. Even\r\nthe independent opera buffa preserved much of this parodying reference\r\nto the opera seria.\r\n\r\nPergolese's \"Serva Padrona\" which was first produced in Naples in 1730,\r\nwas another example of an intermezzo for two characters; it met with\r\ngreat success not only in Italy, but in France[3] and Germany,[4]\r\nand set the fashion for similar pieces. Very soon an intrigue was\r\nintroduced, a connected plot was supplied, and the number of characters\r\nincreased first to three, then to four.[5] The development of the\r\nintermezzo was rapid, and before long the inconvenience of carrying on\r\ntwo independent dramas simultaneously caused the complete emancipation\r\nof opera buffa from opera seria.[6] Equal rank with the latter it never\r\nattained. It came to\r\n\r\n{THE INTERMEZZO.}\r\n\r\n(205)\r\n\r\nmaturity on the boards of the smaller theatres (\"teatrini\"), and was\r\nlong in gaining admission into the larger theatres. Even then it was\r\nonly exceptionally introduced during the season or stagione, side by\r\nside with the opera seria, although in the German court theatres an\r\nopera seria and a buffa were not seldom played alternately during the\r\ncarnival. In Italy comic operas were only admitted in summer, and\r\nat those times when there was no grand opera. They did not pass for\r\nexhibitions of perfect vocal art, and fewer calls were made on the\r\npowers of the singers apart from their comic talent in delivery and\r\naction. There is no doubt that this external subordination was of\r\ninestimable value to the development of the opera buffa.\r\n\r\nIt received a firm foundation of musical configuration--recitative,\r\naria, ensemble--without the necessity of submitting to limitations and\r\nlaws so fixed as to have become absolute. The bass voice, which was\r\nconsidered most suitable to comic characters, and had already been\r\nappropriated to them in the old opera, was made the chief vehicle for\r\ncomic effects in the intermezzo. Volubility of utterance, mimicry, and\r\ncomic action were as necessary as a fine voice. The highly paid male\r\nsoprano might therefore be dispensed with in opera buffa; the unnatural\r\nconventionality of the opera seria would have been insupportable in\r\nrepresentations of daily life. By this means the voices were brought\r\ninto their proper relations; the lover's part was allotted to the\r\ntenor, and the performance generally gained in variety and in the natural\r\ngrouping of the parts.\r\n\r\nThe distinction of primary and secondary parts was disregarded, as well\r\nas the limitation to a small number of vocalists; though these seldom\r\nwent beyond seven.[7] There were usually three female parts; the most\r\ndecidedly comic was the sly, pert waiting-maid (a standing figure of the\r\nopera buffa), or a scolding old woman, an unsophisticated peasant-girl,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(206)\r\n\r\nThe tenor part was usually the sentimental, unhappy lover, and required\r\nmost from the singer, but there were often two tenor parts, in which\r\ncase one was comic; the buffo tenor was not however nearly so well\r\ndefined a part as the buffo bass. The bass parts were decidedly comic;\r\na blustering old man and a cunning or a stupid servant were seldom\r\nwanting. When the lover was a bass, he was either jovial or comical.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this freedom, certain typical features were formed that\r\nrecur in all the varieties of grouping and disguise. The opera buffa was\r\nfar from adopting in dialect or costume the well-defined character, of\r\nthe Italian popular comedy, but the resemblance in form is unmistakable.\r\nIt was in imitation of the popular plays that the comic parts were made\r\ncaricatures, the effect of which depended on striking but exaggerated\r\npeculiarities. The music was made to display these,[8] and there can\r\nbe no doubt that the want of individual character in the opera seria\r\nfavoured the passage to the opposite extreme in the opera buffa. As a\r\nrelief to the caricatures, _mezzo carattere_ were invented, in which the\r\npurely musical element was more pronounced.\r\n\r\nIntermezzi required an easy and loosely connected plot; the popular\r\njokes would not have come out so well from a studied, well-connected\r\ndrama, as from effective situations where favourite characters could\r\nfollow their bent. If the situations were of ample variety, lively and\r\nhumorous in their rendering, the audience was quite ready to forget how\r\nweak the thread was which held them together. The opera buffa was always\r\nwritten for a specified company, and the\r\n\r\n{FORMS OF OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(207)\r\n\r\npoet, limited both as to characters and effective situations, found his\r\nlabour simplified by such a skilful use of the conditions ready to hand\r\nas should secure him applause and success.[9] Opera buffa, being held in\r\nlittle esteem, was seldom taken in hand by poets of note; even\r\nGoldoni's texts are, as he acknowledges himself,[10] unworthy of esteem.\r\nGoethe,[11] when he was studying the comic opera in Rome with the\r\ncomposer Kayser, remarked, that \"there were a hundred things to be\r\nobserved, to which the Italians sacrificed the spirit of the poetry; for\r\ninstance, each character was to be brought forward in a certain order\r\nand a certain degree--each singer must have pauses, &C.\"[12] His own\r\nexperience gave him a very just judgment on opera texts, and he rightly\r\nascribed a certain amount of simplicity, which, apart from the music,\r\nmade them appear poor and meagre, to a tendency to treat the subject\r\nfancifully, like a child's fairy story.[13] But the majority of comic\r\nlibretti are disconnected and absurd, without spirit or delicacy,\r\ndepending entirely on the effect of humorous exaggeration; and the\r\nuniversal opinion was a just one, that the words of the comic opera were\r\nas poor as the music was charming.[14]\r\n\r\nThe musical forms of the opera seria were modified and remodelled by\r\nthe comic composers with very unequal skill and success. The recitative\r\nneeded little transformation; the more trivial treatment of the dialogue\r\nsuggested itself, and the accompanied recitative was only varied to suit\r\nthe comic situations. The aria, on the contrary, belonged essentially to\r\nmusical art, and had been developed at the cost of dramatic truth; opera\r\nbuffa did not concern itself with either of these facts. It adopted\r\nthe forms of the opera seria (unless when it parodied them) only in the\r\nparts _di mezzo car ottere_ which it had appropriated from the opera\r\nseria.\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(208)\r\n\r\nThe contrasting of different motifs was preserved as an essential\r\ncondition of musical composition, but the rules as to method and\r\nsuccession were no longer regarded as binding. The subjects were more\r\nslender and fugitive, so as to be more easily united, and they profited\r\nthereby in freedom of movement and form. In many airs which have only\r\none tempo, the constituent parts of the original aria can be clearly\r\nrecognised, but the subjects are arranged and repeated according to\r\ncircumstances, the subordinate subjects are more important and longer,\r\nand the means at command are more freely used. Piccinni was the first to\r\nintroduce the rondo form, which repeats the main subject several times\r\nwith freely treated intermediate movements. It met with great applause,\r\nand was variously developed, being at last adopted in opera seria.[15]\r\nBut the simpler form of the cavatina was more usual, and received many\r\nmodifications; the ballad style was also not infrequent.\r\n\r\nThis freedom and many-sidedness of treatment was more especially\r\nfavourable to the dramatic aspect of the piece, and brought the plot\r\ninto closer relationship with the music, particularly in the ensembles.\r\nDuets, terzets, and quartets were introduced wherever the situation\r\nrequired, and this musical dramatic character reached its highest point\r\nin the finales, which are true musical representations of a dramatic\r\nclimax ascending to a catastrophe. These finales, products of the\r\ncontinual struggle to render music not the ornament but the helpmeet of\r\nthe drama, are the property of the opera buffa.\r\n\r\nNic. Logroscini, who was considered as the inventor of comic opera, and\r\nthe deity of the _genre bouffon_,[16] is said to have written the\r\nfirst finale, the main subject of which was developed in one continuous\r\nmovement. Nic. Piccinni (whose \"Buona Figliuola\" was so well received in\r\nRome in 1761, that it may serve as a date for the recognition of opera\r\n\r\n{DEVELOPMENT OF OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(209)\r\n\r\nbuffa as a distinct branch of the art) treated each scena of the finale\r\nas a separate movement, and displayed far greater variety and more\r\neffective working-up.\r\n\r\nMany of the deficiencies of the text must have had considerable\r\ninfluence on the music. The latter was constantly striving after\r\ndramatic effect and characteristic situations, and was as constantly\r\ndragged back by caricature and absurdity. The custom also arose of\r\nproviding unworthy comic effects for the buffo characters, such as the\r\nmimicry of natural sounds, quick speaking, and others that have become\r\ngradually extinct. On this point the severe mentorship of the opera\r\nseria exerted a wholesome influence in preventing the complete sacrifice\r\nof form to fun; so that, to the observer of the present day, regularity\r\nof form is more observable in comic opera than freedom of treatment.\r\n\r\nFrom opera seria too the comic opera received its main principle, viz.:\r\nthat the essence of the opera is in music, and more especially in song,\r\non the suitable treatment of which it depends for all its effect.\r\n\r\nThe majority of dramatic composers have tried their hand at opera buffa;\r\nbesides Nic. Logroscini (17...-1763), Bald. Galuppi (1703-1765),\r\nNic. Piccinni (1728-1800), we may particularly note Pietro Guglielmi\r\n(1727-1804), Pasq. Anfossi (1736-1797), Giov. Paisiello (1741-1816),\r\nDomen. Cimarosa (1754-1801), all men of prominent parts and thorough\r\nmusical training. Add to this the innate love of the Italians for beauty\r\nof form, and it will be easily comprehensible that in spite of many\r\nexcrescences opera buffa should have blossomed into a musical art, which\r\nin creative genius and intellectual power soared far higher than its\r\nelder sister, whom it soon surpassed in the favour of the public.[17]\r\n\r\nThe greater freedom of style was of advantage also to the instrumental\r\nparts, which took an independent share in the characterisation. Many\r\nsituations were heightened by the orchestra coming to the foreground--as\r\nfor instance during the frequently recurring _parlando_ where it falls\r\nto the instruments to give the clue to the intended expression.\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(210)\r\n\r\nThe instrumental scores which Piccinni was blamed for overloading\r\nand making unnecessarily prominent appear to us indescribably\r\npoverty-stricken.[18] But it was thus that the orchestra gradually\r\ndeveloped into such an independence as makes it capable of following the\r\nrapid emotions of the actors, and of serving at the same time as a firm\r\nfoundation for the whole artistic organism.\r\n\r\nThe overture in three movements was not the only one permissible;\r\nsymphonies in two parts were frequent, as also a somewhat more elaborate\r\nallegro movement, which served as an instrumental introduction.\r\n\r\nAnfossi's \"Finta Giardiniera\" had met with great success in Rome in\r\n1774, whilst Piccinni's opera was hissed off the stage. In spite of its\r\nmiserable text it was produced in 1775 at Vienna,[19] and in 1778 at\r\nParis;[20] and at Munich Mozart received the libretto to compose for the\r\nCarnival of 1775--\r\n\r\nThe dramatis persona are as follows:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa Violante Onesti has been wounded by her lover Conte\r\nBelfiore in a fit of jealousy, and he, believing that he has slain her,\r\nflees. She sets forth in disguise to seek him, accompanied by a faithful\r\nservant, Roberto; they both enter the service of Don Anchise, Podestà of\r\nLagonero, as gardeners, she under the name of Sandrina and he as\r\n\r\n{\"LA FINTA GIARDINIERA,\" 1775.}\r\n\r\n(211)\r\n\r\nNardo. The Podestà falls in love with Sandrina and neglects for her the\r\nwaiting-maid Serpetta, to whom he has been paying his addresses. Nardo\r\nstrives in vain for Serpetta's favour; the two intruders are equally\r\nobnoxious to her. Ramiro, Don Anchise's guest, and the accepted lover of\r\nhis niece Arminda, is deserted by the latter, who becomes affianced to\r\nBelfiore.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the opera the inhabitants of Lagonero are busily\r\nemployed decorating the garden for the reception of the betrothed\r\ncouple; Ramiro informs the Podestà that an unhappy love torments him,\r\nand departs. The Podestà sends Nardo and Serpetta to a distance, in\r\norder that he may declare his love to Sandrina; this she seeks to\r\nevade, while Serpetta continually contrives to interrupt them, so giving\r\noccasion for a comic aria from the Podestà. Thereupon Sandrina announces\r\nto Nardo her intention of leaving the place to escape the attentions of\r\nthe Podestà, and complains of the faithlessness of men; Ramiro entering,\r\nbewails the inconstancy of women, and Nardo the cruelty of Serpetta.\r\nArminda, who has just arrived, behaves whimsically to the Podestà and\r\nSerpetta; Conte Belfiore enters, greets her as his bride, and comports\r\nhimself like a vain affected fop, boasting to the Podestà of his\r\nnobility, his wealth, his good looks, his conquests, and his love for\r\nArminda.\r\n\r\nSerpetta and Nardo having quarrelled, we next find Sandrina busy in the\r\ngarden. Arminda informs her that she is about to wed Conte Belfiore;\r\nupon which Sandrina swoons. Arminda calls Belfiore, and leaves\r\nthe unconscious Sandrina to his care while she runs for her\r\nsmell-ing-bottle; when she returns Ramiro enters, and the four lovers\r\nrecognise each other in extreme confusion; the Podestà, entering, seeks\r\nin vain for a solution of the mystery; they all go out, and leave him\r\nalone. Before he can recover from his astonishment, Serpetta, to excite\r\nhis jealousy, relates that she has seen Belfiore and Sandrina holding\r\ntender intercourse, and he withdraws in order to watch them. Belfiore\r\ntries to extort from Sandrina the confession that she is Violante; at\r\nfirst she denies it, but then forgets herself and reproaches him for\r\nhis infidelity. As he falls repentant at her feet, Arminda enters\r\nwith Ramiro, all the rest rush in, overwhelm him and Sandrina with\r\nreproaches, and the act closes amid universal confusion.\r\n\r\nThe second act opens with Ramiro reproaching Arminda for her\r\ninconstancy, while she does the same to Belfiore; then Serpetta makes\r\nfun of Nardo. Sandrina, who, in her own despite, still loves Belfiore,\r\nis surprised by him in the garden, forgets herself again, and overwhelms\r\nhim with reproaches; when he remorsefully sues for her love again, she\r\nrecollects herself, and explains that she has known Violante, and has\r\nonly been giving expression to her feelings. Quite confused, he makes\r\nher tender excuses, and tries to kiss her hand, but seizes instead that\r\nof the Podestà, who has drawn near unobserved, and goes out confounded.\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(212)\r\n\r\nThe Podestà first reproaches Sandrina, then makes her a formal\r\ndeclaration of love, which she seeks in vain to evade. Ramiro enters\r\nwith a letter, wherein Belfiore is denounced as the murderer of the\r\nMarchesa Onesti, and requires the Podestà to institute a formal inquiry;\r\nto Arminda's disgust the Podestà declares the marriage postponed, and\r\nRamiro is filled with fresh hope. The Podestà interrogates Belfiore,\r\nwho, in spite of the whispered hints of Arminda and Serpetta, becomes\r\nconfused, and draws great suspicion on himself; then Sandrina appears,\r\nand explains that she is the Marchesa Violante who was wounded, not\r\nkilled; they do not believe her, and treat her with contempt. When she\r\nis alone with Belfiore, and he in delight renews his expressions of\r\nlove, she tells him she is not Violante, but has only impersonated her\r\nto save him. Amazed and horrified, he loses his senses and begins to\r\nrave, but soon comes to himself.\r\n\r\nSerpetta informs the Podestà and Ramiro that Sandrina has fled, but when\r\nthey have hurried forth to seek her, betrays to the listening Nardo that\r\nArminda has had her rival conveyed to a hiding-place in the neighbouring\r\nwood, in order to prevent any interference with her union to Belfiore.\r\n\r\nNext we see Sandrina left alone in darkness, want, and despair; in\r\nquick succession there enter Belfiore led by Nardo, the Podestà seeking\r\nSandrina, and Arminda and Serpetta to make sure that she is secure; in\r\nthe darkness the Podestà declares himself to Arminda, and Belfiore\r\nto Serpetta, both believing that they are addressing Sandrina, to the\r\ndelight of Nardo, who now enters, followed by Ramiro with torches,\r\ncalling upon Belfiore to renounce the hand of Arminda. When the party\r\nrecognise each other there is first great consternation; then all break\r\ninto abuse and reproaches; Sandrina comes to an understanding with\r\nBelfiore, they both imagine themselves shepherds, and amid the universal\r\nhubbub sing pastoral ditties; then she enacts Medusa, he Hercules, and\r\nat last they dance with delight, while the others are beside themselves\r\nwith anger and astonishment.\r\n\r\nIn the third act, Nardo is again scorned by Serpetta, then Belfiore and\r\nSandrina attack him, making passionate love to him in their madness, and\r\nhe escapes with difficulty. The Podestà is beset by Serpetta, whom he\r\nrepulses, by Arminda, who wants to wed Belfiore, and by Ramiro, who\r\ndemands Arminda's hand, though she again declares that she detests him.\r\n\r\nBelfiore and Sandrina having fallen asleep in the garden, awake to soft\r\nmusic, cured of their madness; they recognise each other, and after some\r\nresistance she listens to his suit. Upon this Arminda resolves to bestow\r\nher hand on Ramiro, and Serpetta on Nardo, and only the Podestà remains\r\nunmated.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task even to follow these clumsily connected situations,\r\ntoo incoherent to be called a plot; and it\r\n\r\n{\"LA FINTA GIARDINIERA\"--GERMAN VERSION.}\r\n\r\n(213)\r\n\r\nwould have taxed the efforts of any composer to save such a work from\r\nutter oblivion.\r\n\r\nOnly the second and third acts of Mozart's original score (196 K.) are\r\npreserved, in two volumes, containing together 344 pages; the first\r\nis lost, and there is no known copy of the Italian score, so that the\r\nrecitatives of the first act are unknown.\r\n\r\nThe opera was later produced in German; the German text is inserted in\r\nthe original score by L. Mozart, with trifling alterations of a note\r\nhere and there to suit the declamation. Besides these there are numerous\r\nabbreviations, both in the recitatives and in some of the songs (13,\r\n17, 19, 25), which were made for the first performance at Munich, and\r\nindicated by rough chalk strokes and erasures; with the same end, Mozart\r\nrecomposed the whole of an abridged scene.\r\n\r\nThe abridged songs are adopted in the German version, but one air (20),\r\nwhich was marked in chalk \"to be omitted,\" is retained. That Wolfgang\r\nwas himself concerned in this adaptation is proved by the fact that on\r\ncertain pages the accompanied recitatives which were retained in the\r\nGerman opera are rewritten in his own hand. Spoken dialogue takes the\r\nplace of the plain recitatives, and the German cues are inserted by\r\na third hand. In Rei-chardt's \"Theaterkalender,\" the operetta, \"Das\r\nverstellte Gartner-Madchen\" has been included among Mozart's works since\r\n1781, and it was performed under this title at Frankfort in 1789.\r\nMozart probably undertook the adaptation after his return from Paris to\r\nSalzburg, when he busied himself with the improvement of German opera.\r\nThe translation may safely be ascribed to Schachtner. The score is\r\npreserved in duplicate; and a selection of the songs was printed by\r\nAndré under the title \"Die Gärtnerin aus Liebe.\"[21]\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(214)\r\n\r\nThis opera takes an unquestionably higher rank both as to originality,\r\ntechnical skill, and vivid characterisation than any that had preceded\r\nit. The seven personages, all drawn in firm outline with a sure hand,\r\nare not all comic characters.\r\n\r\nThe part of Ramiro is avowedly written for a male soprano, probably for\r\nthe celebrated Tomm. Consoli (b. 1753), who entered the Munich Kapelle\r\nin 1744, and was summoned to Salzburg for the approaching festival\r\nperformance. The part is throughout a serious one; Ramiro is the\r\nsentimental unfortunate lover, who only becomes comic by his alternate\r\nhopes and fears, as, true to his first inclinations, he opposes\r\nArminda's jealous resentment.\r\n\r\nIn his first unimpassioned song (2) he declares that, being scarcely\r\nhealed from his first unhappy attachment, he recoils from all fresh\r\nenticements; he has not yet seen his faithless beloved again, the sight\r\nof whom afterwards causes him to forget all in the desire to win her.\r\nThe cavatina (18) renders the sentiment of true and hopeful love simply\r\nand tenderly. Finally, resentment against his faithless mistress is\r\nexpressed in an agitated air (21) with strongly accentuated declamation\r\nand rapid changes of harmony. All three songs render consistently the\r\nexalted mood of a man of sentiment, whose passions, nevertheless, are\r\nnot consumed by their own intensity; the individuality of the singer\r\nmay doubtless have lent itself to this treatment of the part. This\r\nindividuality is also evident in the fact that Ramiro's songs pay chief\r\nregard to the singer in the passages, and adhere closely to the older\r\nforms. But there is unmistakable progress in the richer and freer\r\ngrouping of the subjects, and in the delicate feeling with which the\r\ndigression in the middle movement is treated, and gradually led back to\r\nthe main subject.\r\n\r\nArminda stands next to Ramiro. As an imperious, passionate girl, who\r\nill-uses her faithful lover, and runs after another man, she is more\r\nrepulsive than comic. Musical characterisation, by giving to her\r\nviolence an air of pettishness, has introduced a comic element into her\r\nfirst air (7) which brings the noble lady very near the soubrette. The\r\nair (13) in which she threatens the Count with vengeance for\r\n\r\n{\"LA FINTA GIARDINIERA\"--SANDRINA.}\r\n\r\n(215)\r\n\r\nhis inconstancy has a caricatured expression of the pathetic, which\r\nparodies the manner of the opera seria, and might, therefore, produce a\r\ncomic effect. The absence of all bravura in this part, in spite of the\r\nstyle of the songs, which seems to call for it, was no doubt to suit the\r\nparticular singer--a seconda donna.\r\n\r\nThe part of Sandrina was expressly written for Rosa Manservisi, who\r\nwas highly thought of, both as a singer and an actress.[22] It is comic\r\nneither in intention nor fact. An unhappy woman, of deep and\r\ndelicate feelings, injured and deceived, is forced by adverse fate to\r\ndissimulate; the difficulties into which she is led by her disguise are\r\nnot ludicrous, but painful, and excite only sympathy. It was common at\r\nthe time to introduce persons and situations of a sentimental character\r\ninto opera buffa, without any regard to the incongruity of different\r\nstyles.[23] The principal scena given to Sandrina at the close of the\r\nsecond act quite oversteps the boundary of opera buffa. Left deserted\r\nin the dark and gloomy forest, she gives vent to her despair in a song\r\n(21), which strikingly expresses the breathless anguish of a tender,\r\ntimid maiden, in the face of unknown dangers.\r\n\r\nA characteristic passage for the violins--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nthe agitated nature of which is increased by syncopated notes in the\r\naccompaniment, and by the strong accent thrown on the last fourth of\r\nevery bar--goes through the whole movement of the allegro agitato in\r\nvaried modulation; the voice comes in with detached exclamations, and\r\nonce a melodious phrase silences the accompaniment for a moment, until\r\nthe orchestra again takes up its restless movement. The song passes\r\nimmediately into an expressive accompanied\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(216)\r\n\r\nrecitative, in which Sandrina becomes calmer, and assures herself,\r\nby looking round, of her forsaken condition. This is followed by the\r\ncavatina (22)--\r\n\r\n     Ah dal pianto, dal singhiozzo\r\n     Respirar io posso appena,\r\n     Non ho voce, non ho lena,\r\n     L' alma in sen mancando và--\r\n\r\nwhich carries the expression of long-restrained feeling to its highest\r\npoint. Throughout a restless, hurrying Allegro agitato (6-8) the voice\r\nhas almost always interrupted passages, and seldom tries its powers in a\r\nsustained note or a melodious phrase. The orchestra remains in continual\r\nmotion; at first a tender violin passage is introduced, then the oboes\r\nand bassoons alternate with each other, and with the voice. The whole is\r\na single continuous thread of lovely melody and richly varied harmony,\r\nwith one fundamental idea as its starting-point, and upon it rests the\r\nmagic of grace and beauty. To the expression of excited passion follows\r\nthat of resignation; both are manifestations of a nature tender and\r\nnoble indeed, but neither grand nor strong.\r\n\r\nMozart's correct judgment led him to moderate the expression of passion\r\nin Sandrina to a degree befitting the heroine of a comic opera, while\r\ngiving due prominence to her dignity and grace when she appears as the\r\ngardener's girl. She displays her true self most unreservedly in the\r\ncavatina (11) in which she bewails her unhappy love:--\r\n\r\n     Geme la tortorella\r\n     Lungi dalla compagna,\r\n     Del suo destin si lagna\r\n     E par, che in sua favella\r\n     Vogli destar pietà.\r\n     Io son la tortorella, &c.\r\n\r\nSonnleithner has noted the happy effect produced by the entrance of the\r\nvoice, not at the beginning of the theme, but a little behind it, as if\r\nroused from abstraction:--\r\n\r\n{\"LÀ FINTA GIARDINIERA\"--BELFIORE.}\r\n\r\n(217)\r\n\r\n[See Page Image] A gentle spirit, not altogether lost in sadness, yet\r\nnot able entirely to throw it off, is in Sandrina united to tender\r\nwomanly grace, and both find due expression in the music. Even when she\r\nplays the gardener's girl, she does it with pleasant mirth never sinking\r\nto vulgarity. The air (4) in which she undertakes the defence of women\r\nagainst men to Ramiro (a rondo with a lively coda, 6-8), is gay and\r\nsparkling, but not very pronounced in tone.\r\n\r\nWhen she seeks by her cajoleries to appease the sulky Podestà without\r\nexactly telling him that she loves him, she reveals a certain amount\r\nof coquetry, and in her exaggerated expressions of dismay at his\r\nreproaches, approaches the buffo character; but even here the\r\nmoderation, delicacy, and grace of Sandrina's character is in strong\r\ncontrast to that of Serpetta.\r\n\r\nBoth the comic and the pathetic aspects are combined in the Contino\r\nBelfiore, whose burlesque character appears to have been excellently\r\nrepresented by the buffo Rossi. His attempt on Violante's life sets him\r\nbefore us as a man of passion; the wavering of his inclinations between\r\nArminda and Violante is the less comical, since he expresses his\r\nadmiration of Arminda's beauty with simple and manly\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(218)\r\n\r\ndignity (6), but gives vent to his love for Sandrina, whom he recognises\r\nas Violante, in a fine outburst of true emotion. The conclusion of this\r\nsong (15), being buffo in character, readjusts the situation. He has not\r\nremarked that Sandrina has gone out, and the Podestà taken her place,\r\nand he seizes the hand of the Podestà to kiss it; his confusion and\r\nannoyance required comic expression. He takes part elsewhere in comic\r\nscenes and situations; but his first appearance as a vain, supercilious\r\ncoxcomb is misleading and inconsistent, and only intended to give\r\noccasion for a grand buffo air (8). The pride and loquacity with which\r\nBelfiore details his genealogy are wittily rendered by Mozart; but as\r\na buffo song this evident concession to the taste of the singer and the\r\npublic is without marked individuality. Still less happy is the idea of\r\nmaking the Contino, and afterwards Sandrina, go crazy. Madness is only\r\nrepresentable in music in so far as sympathy with it as a misfortune can\r\nbe aroused, which deprives it of any comic effect; the absurdities which\r\nexcite to laughter cannot be rendered musically, and only in rare\r\ncases can music produce an analogous effect. In the second finale, when\r\nSandrina and Belfiore, surrounded by bitter enemies, suddenly imagine\r\nthemselves Arcadian shepherds, and sing shepherd songs, a contrast might\r\nbe produced which would at least support the idea of insanity. But\r\ntheir mythological illusions: \"Io son Medusa orribile! Io son Alcide\r\nintrepido!\" could not be expressed by the music. In the terzet (24)\r\nNardo, in order to escape the importunities of the crazy pair, points\r\ntowards heaven, and tells them with increasing animation how the sun and\r\nmoon quarrel, and the stars engage in love adventures; when he has set\r\nthe pair gazing fixedly upwards, he makes off. Broadly represented,\r\nthis gay, lively terzet must have made an effect, but it would have been\r\nequally comic had Nardo fixed their attention on anything else, since\r\nthe effect depends on the vivacity and humour with which the composer\r\ngrasps the situation, and withdraws the attention of the audience from\r\nthe nonsense which the poet has put into the mouths of the characters.\r\n\r\nBut even this was impossible in the accompanied recitative during which\r\nBelfiore loses his senses before the eyes of the\r\n\r\n{\"LA FINTA GIARDINIERA\"--BUFFO PARTS.}\r\n\r\n(219)\r\n\r\naudience (19). At first, when he is beset by contending emotions, music\r\nis in its place; when he believes himself to be dead and in Elysium,\r\nMozart has certainly constructed a characteristic, well-rounded\r\nmovement, but a specific expression of the illusion it is not and cannot\r\nbe. The song in which, restored to his senses, he expresses his joy at\r\nstill living (in tempo di minuetto) is lively, and appeals to the senses\r\nlike dance music, but after what has gone before it makes no comic\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nThe first bar of this--[See Page Image] reminds us, as Sonnleithner has\r\nremarked, both of the minuet and trio of the Symphony in D major (385\r\nK.), and of a couple of bars in the first allegro of the Symphony in E\r\nflat major (543 K.).\r\n\r\nThe Podestà is a genuine buffo, proud, amorous, consequential in virtue\r\nof his office, easily excited, easily perplexed, but good-natured\r\nat bottom; the genuine type of a comic old man; there was probably a\r\npersonal reason for making this character tenor instead of bass, though\r\nthe course was not an unusual one.[24] The musical conception of the\r\ncharacter is that of the traditional buffo. The first air (3) depicts,\r\naccording to a fashion of the time, different instruments which are\r\nheard in the orchestra in a concerted accompaniment. This song has\r\nnothing in common with the situation or with the character of the\r\nPodestà, and is an interpolation for the German version.\r\n\r\nThe Italian text contains a song for Sandrina, \"Dentro il mio petto io\r\nsento,\" which Mozart composed, as we learn from a letter of his father's\r\n(December 2, 1780), who had it copied for Schikaneder. The other two\r\nsongs (17, 25) are genuine buffo--lively, rapidly uttered--a continual\r\nstruggle between false dignity, anger, vexation, and perplexity.\r\n\r\nThe servants are also, according to custom, comic\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(220)\r\n\r\npersonages. Serpetta contrasts with Sandrina in want of refinement;\r\ndisappointed in her hopes of the Podestà, she becomes envious and\r\nspiteful to every one, and especially to her lover, Nardo. Besides a\r\nneat, pretty little song, of which each character sings a verse (9),\r\nshe has two songs (10, 20) of a distinctly soubrette character, gay and\r\npleasing, not without grace, but as yet without the delicate wit with\r\nwhich Mozart later endowed his soubrettes.\r\n\r\nNardo, as the attached and faithful servant of Violante, displays an\r\naddress which is inconsistent with his röle of the simple lover who\r\npursues Serpetta in spite of all her ill-treatment. The first words of\r\nthe mock-heroic air (5), \"A forza di martelli il ferro si riduce,\" have\r\nsuggested an accompaniment--[See Page Image] which gives the song a\r\npeculiarly rhythmical character. In the second air (14) the rondo form\r\nis employed with striking effect. Nardo seeks to win Serpetta's hand by\r\ncompliments in different languages and styles, which form alternating\r\ninterludes to the main theme; this is pretty enough, but the other jokes\r\nare obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe ensembles are of a far higher character than the solos, both as\r\nregards characterisation and musical execution.\r\n\r\nThe introduction is immediately connected with the overture, and borrows\r\nits lively chorus from the third movement, but its development is\r\ncompletely independent. The overture itself consists of an Allegro\r\nmolto, precise in its subjects and execution, but fresh and cheerful,\r\nand of a somewhat tedious Andante grazioso.\r\n\r\nSandrina, Serpetta, Ramiro, the Podestà, and Nardo, are discovered\r\nin the garden, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests, and their\r\nfestive mood is expressed by a joyous choral movement. Then each\r\ncharacter in a short soliloquy explains the position of affairs, and\r\nindicates the main elements of the plot. In these soli, which pass from\r\none to the other in the same tempo, and without a pause, Mozart\r\n\r\n{\"LA FINTA GIARDINIERA\"--ENSEMBLES.}\r\n\r\n(221)\r\n\r\nhas displayed his rare power of individualisation, and without the\r\nsacrifice of interdependence in the parts of a great whole. The\r\nmoonstruck Ramiro, the amorous Podestà, the excitable, prying\r\nSerpetta--each is admirably touched off, without any disregard to\r\nunity of tone. The repetition of the first chorus, with which the piece\r\nconcludes, is led up to by the accompaniment, and the whole forms as\r\ncomplete a musical rendering of the text as was possible.\r\n\r\nThe later ensembles belong immediately to the action of the piece. At\r\nthe close of the third act Sandrina and Belfiore awake from refreshing\r\nsleep healed of their madness. Belfiore seeks acceptance of Sandrina,\r\nwho now acknowledges herself to be Violante, but she, abashed at his\r\ndeclarations of love, bids him depart, and prepares to go herself.\r\nNeither, however, can summon resolution to part, and after several\r\nattempts, they sink at last in one another's arms, forgetful of all but\r\ntheir newly found happiness. This situation, somewhat coarsely rendered\r\nby the poet, has been transformed by the composer into an admirable\r\npiece of character-painting (27). A long accompanied recitative passes\r\ninto an elaborate and effective Adagio, in which professions of love\r\nalternate with reproaches. The Andantino (3-8), which follows is lighter\r\nin tone, and well expresses alternations of repulsion and attraction.\r\nThe oboes are employed with a charming effect of longing appeal to\r\nthe words: \"_Cont_. Lei mi chiàma?--_Sandrina_. Signor, nö. Lei\r\nritoma?--_Cont._ Oibö, oibö!\" Finally, the joy of the united pair flows\r\nforth in an Allegro, which gives full opportunity for display on the\r\npart of the singers. Especially to be admired is the art with which the\r\nintense and genuine expression of emotion is tempered by the timidity of\r\nthe Count and the coquetry of Sandrina, in a happy union of the pathetic\r\nand the comic which keeps the whole within the limits of' opera buffa.\r\nThe rapid winding-up of the plot in the recitative dialogue, and the\r\nshort animated ensemble with which the opera concludes (28) are no doubt\r\nintended not to weaken the effect of the great duet.\r\n\r\nThe finales (12, 22) of the first and second acts are masterpieces; the\r\nseparate characters act and react on each other\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(222)\r\n\r\nin a way which is admirably true to life. Two conditions are essential\r\nto the elevation of such pieces into musical works of art; important\r\npoints in the action or the characters must be brought out by prominent\r\nmotifs, and the fundamental idea of the situation must be grasped and\r\nmaintained in one motif which shall serve as a clue to the whole.\r\n\r\nThe task of the musician is the combination and elaboration of the\r\ndetached elements into an interdependent whole, in which the laws of\r\nmusical and dramatic art are in unconscious harmony; the master makes\r\ngood his claim to the title by the depth with which he grasps the idea,\r\nby the delicacy with which he apportions the claims of individuals to\r\nindependence, and by the strength and truth with which he gives life\r\nto his creations. Mozart's genius amply satisfies all these conditions.\r\nWhen there are few characters, and they are consequently brought nearer\r\ntogether, the characteristics of each are sharper and more detailed; but\r\nwhen the relations of the characters to each other are more involved,\r\nthe musical grouping becomes more careful, so that, just as in an\r\narchitectural masterpiece, the parts are merged in the whole. Each motif\r\nhas its own peculiar expression, but is capable of such manifold effects\r\nof light and shade, that an oft-used motif in a new combination is as\r\neffective as if it appeared for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe form and style of opera buffa are maintained in all essential\r\npoints, but with great freedom of treatment. The usual means are\r\nemployed of the repetition of a short phrase with increasing intensity,\r\nthe _parlando_ while the orchestra carries on the motif, the comic\r\neffect produced by rapid speaking, sudden pauses, strong contrasts, &c.;\r\nbut to these are added many traits of original invention.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier operas the boy's skill in the management of accepted\r\nforms was what we had chiefly to notice; here for the first time we\r\nare amazed at the originality of his musical powers. The wealth\r\nof characteristic, well-moulded, well-rounded melodies is quite as\r\nsurprising as the organic dependence in which they mutually stand\r\nrelated to each other, not merely joined together. This fertility is of\r\ncourse\r\n\r\n{\"LA FINTA GIARDINIERA\"--ORCHESTRA.}\r\n\r\n(223)\r\n\r\nmore prominent as the development of the plot renders the musical\r\nelements more complicated; especially admirable is Mozart's power of\r\ngiving character and suggestiveness to his melodies in their first and\r\nsimplest form. One subject from the last Allegro but one of the first\r\nfinale--[See Page Image] will not fail to remind the reader of one\r\nalmost identical from the first finale of \"Figaro.\" But if the mode of\r\ntreatment of the simple motif in the two instances be compared, it will\r\nbe clearly seen that inventive power does not consist merely in the\r\ncombination of notes. That of the later opera is of course by far\r\nsuperior, but even the earlier leaves little to wish for in its wealth\r\nof harmonic variety, in its union with other subjects, and in the effect\r\nof climax produced by imitation in the several parts.\r\n\r\nIt may finally and with justice be maintained of the melodies of this\r\nopera that they, as well as the whole intellectual conception, are high\r\nabove the ordinary level; their grace, delicacy, and purity--in short,\r\ntheir beauty--belongs to Mozart, and to him alone.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra is treated quite otherwise than in the opera seria. The\r\nindividual peculiarity of each instrument is\r\n\r\n{OPERA BUFFA.}\r\n\r\n(224)\r\n\r\nbrought out, and tone-colouring as a means of characterisation is\r\ndelicately and skilfully employed. In Sandrina's cavatina (22), for\r\ninstance, the fine effect of the oboe and bassoon in contrast to the\r\nviolin is due to the individualities of the instruments; in Ramiro's\r\nsong (18) the treatment of the bassoon is original; and in the first\r\nfinale an oboe solo comes in with startling effect (the Munich oboist,\r\nSecchi, was very famous).[25] The horns are also frequently made\r\nthe means of effective tone-colouring; twice (13, 26) four horns are\r\nemployed in a minor key to heighten the effect of a dramatic climax.\r\nMore important than these detached instances is the altered relation\r\nof the orchestra to the whole work.[26] It no longer serves as an\r\naccompaniment in the sense of sustaining the voices and filling up\r\nnecessary pauses; it is no longer a mere adjunct to the vocal parts,\r\nbut takes its share in the effective working of the whole, filling out\r\ndetails which the vocal parts leave imperfect, and obeying not so\r\nmuch the requirements of the vocalist as the conditions of artistic\r\nperfection. This altered relationship required an altered organisation;\r\neach component part of the orchestra must have a distinct existence,\r\nso that each, according to its place and kind, might contribute to the\r\ngeneral effect. The single example of the treatment of the basses will\r\nserve to make this clear. Hitherto the basses had served merely as the\r\nfundamental of the melody, indispensable indeed, but often clumsy\r\nand insignificant; but here, without losing their character as the\r\nground-work of harmonic elaboration, they have an independent movement;\r\nthey serve not only to support the superincumbent mass, but their\r\nquickening power sets in motion and gives the impulse to its formation.\r\n\r\nBy the side of these many excellencies the too great length of most of\r\nthe pieces, especially of the songs, is felt as a defect throughout; a\r\ndefect due, no doubt, to the taste of the time and to the youth of the\r\ncomposer. The influence of the broader form of the opera seria, and the\r\npleasure of the\r\n\r\n{\"IL RE PASTORE,\" 1775.}\r\n\r\n(225)\r\n\r\npublic in the mere hearing of music, were combined with the fact that\r\nMozart was not yet capable of that self-criticism which rejects all that\r\nis superfluous, even when it is good in itself.\r\n\r\nIt may well be conceived that the opera was performed with extraordinary\r\nsuccess in Munich (1775), and that it soon attained pre-eminence among\r\nthe most admired contemporary comic operas. Nissen informs us that it\r\nmade little effect in Frankfort (1789); the clumsy German adaptation may\r\nhave been in part to blame for this; but the chief cause was doubtless\r\nthe altered taste of the public, brought about by the French operettas\r\nand Mozart's \"Entführung.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Opitz's \"Dafhe\" (1627) follows Rinuccini's original in fidelity to\r\nthe ancient style; a second adaptation, performed in 1672 and 1678, with\r\nmusic by Gius.

MOZART'S \"RE PASTORE.\"\r\n\r\n(226)\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S \"RE PASTORE.\"}\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE last opera of the series we have been considering is the festival\r\nopera, \"Il Re Pastore,\" composed in honour of the Archduke Maximilian,\r\nat Salzburg, in 1775, to the text of Metastasio (208 K.).\r\n\r\nThe characters and plot are as follows:[1]--\r\n\r\nAlessandro, re di Macedonia.\r\n\r\nAminta, pastorello, amante d' Elisa, che, ignoto a se stesso, si scuopre\r\npoi l' unico legittimo erede del regno di Sidone.\r\n\r\nElisa, nobile ninfa di Fenicia, dell' antica stirpe di Cadmo, amante d'\r\nAminta.\r\n\r\nTamiry principessa fuggitiva, figliuola del tiranno Stratone; in abito\r\ndi pastorella, amante di Agenore.\r\n\r\nAgenore, nobile di Sidone, amico di Alessandro, amante di Tamiri.\r\n\r\nAlexander having conquered Sidon and slain the tyrant Strabo, determines\r\nto place on the throne Abdalonymus,[2] son of the last rightful king,\r\nwho has been secretly brought up as a shepherd under the name of Aminta,\r\nby a faithful dependent of his father.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the piece we find him in the midst of his flocks,\r\nwhile Elisa brings him the joyful tidings of the probable consent of\r\nher parents to their union. She has scarcely left him when Alexander,\r\nconducted by Agenore, enters, in order to convince himself if Aminta\r\nis worthy of the throne he intends to offer him; Aminta's virtuous\r\nmoderation stands every test. While he is watering his flocks there\r\nenters Tamiri, Strabo's daughter, disguised as a shepherdess; Agenore\r\nextols to her Alexander's generosity, and promises to intercede on\r\nher behalf. The assurance of his faithful love consoles her, and she\r\nresolves to await his answer, concealed by Elisa. Elisa now enters,\r\nbearing to Aminta her father's full consent to their union; in the midst\r\nof their transport, Agenore makes Aminta acquainted with his destiny,\r\nhands him the crown, and summons him to the presence of Alexander. The\r\nlovers pledge their faith anew with much rejoicing.\r\n\r\nIn the second act, Elisa and Tamiri come to the camp of Alexander,\r\nin order to see their lovers. Tamiri, unable to overcome her fear,\r\nwithdraws; Elisa seeks in vain to speak to Aminta, Agenore informing her\r\nthat Aminta is occupied with more important concerns, at the same time\r\nthat he respectfully reminds Aminta, who is impatient to find Elisa,\r\nof his duties as a monarch. At last Alexander appears and receives the\r\ngrateful homage of Aminta, who expresses most virtuous resolutions for\r\nhis future rule. On Alexander expressing regret that Tamiri should shun\r\nhis presence, Agenore takes the opportunity of acquainting Alexander\r\nwith her near approach. To Agenore's dismay Alexander resolves to unite\r\nher with Aminta. With the idea, however, that this will conduce to\r\nTamiri's happiness, Agenore controls his desires, and counsels Aminta\r\nto renounce Elisa. Before the unwilling lover is convinced, Tamiri and\r\nElisa enter, and, seeing their lovers stand confused and silent, believe\r\nthem to be faithless.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the third act, Aminta, after many scruples, informs\r\nAgenore of his determination to fulfil the duty which he believes\r\nhimself to owe to Alexander. These tidings are carried by Agenore to\r\nElisa, who refuses to doubt Aminta's truth, and will not be persuaded\r\nthat submission to her fate will best prove her love for Aminta.\r\nAgenore's own constancy is put to a severer test when Tamiri vehemently\r\naccuses him of having deserted her for Aminta's sake, but he remains\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\nThen there appears before Alexander, who is preparing for the\r\ncelebration of the union, first Tamiri, who declares her love for\r\nAgenore, and refuses to break her faith with him, even for the sake of a\r\nthrone; then Elisa, who tells the claims she has on Aminta's heart;\r\nand finally Aminta himself, dressed as a shepherd, returns his crown\r\nto Alexander, being unable to renounce Elisa's love. Moved by all this\r\nnobleness and devotion, Alexander unites the lovers, reinstates Aminta\r\nas King of Sidon, and promises to conquer another realm for Agenore.\r\n\r\n{\"IL RE PASTORE,\" 1775.}\r\n\r\n(227)\r\n\r\nMetastasio wrote this opera in 1751 for performance at court by four\r\nmaids of honour and a cavalier;[3] he paid due regard to fitting\r\ncostumes, and to the virtue and nobility of each character.[4] The\r\npains he took at the rehearsals were requited;[5] Bono's music was\r\nexcellent,[6] the scenery and costumes most brilliant, the noble\r\nperformers acquitted themselves to perfection, and all was applause and\r\napprobation.[7] No wonder that he recommended the piece to Farinelli as\r\na suitable festival opera;[8] it has, in fact, been composed very often\r\nsince.[9]\r\n\r\nIt was considerably curtailed for representation at Salzburg. The\r\nsecond and third acts were compressed into one, whereby not only was the\r\ndialogue abridged, but several songs were omitted without serious injury\r\nto the text. There were other small alterations and some few additions,\r\nbut nothing essential was disturbed. Instead of Aminta's first air (act\r\n1, sc. 2) another was introduced with an accompanied recitative, and\r\nbefore the duet at the end of the first act an accompanied recitative\r\nwas omitted. Instead of the short concluding chorus, a kind of finale\r\nwas inserted, in which soli and tutti alternate. The part of Agenore was\r\ngiven to a tenor,[10] Aminta to the male soprano Consoli; beyond this we\r\nknow nothing of the cast or of the performance.\r\n\r\nMozart's composition, of which the original score in two volumes of 284\r\npages has been preserved, has the same finish of execution and invention\r\nwhich was so marvellously seen in the \"Finta Giardiniera\"; but the\r\nconventionalities of form are far more of a hindrance here than in the\r\nprevious\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S \"RE PASTORE.\"}\r\n\r\n(228)\r\n\r\nwork. No scope was allowed for dramatic force or true passion; the\r\nwork must be kept strictly within the limits of the festival opera. The\r\nSalzburg singers too, seem to have preferred the beaten track to any\r\nextraordinary displays of skill.\r\n\r\nThis is most apparent in the tenor part of Alexander. His three songs,\r\nwhose commonplace virtuous reflections give little scope for musical\r\ntreatment, have, like the regular bravura songs, a long ritornello,\r\nbravura passages, the shake at the end, the usual cadenza. In details,\r\nthe effort to metamorphose the form is apparent; the second part appears\r\nas a second subject, and the passages are made more interesting by their\r\nharmonic treatment, and by the prominence given to the accompaniment.\r\nThe melodies are better built up, they have more musical substance;\r\nthe accompaniment takes up detached portions of the chief melodies, and\r\ngives a firmer connection to the parts. The words of the first air\r\n(4) give occasion for some of the then favourite musical painting;\r\nlightning, thunder, and rain are depicted by the orchestra, but\r\nwithout undue prominence. The second air (9) is interesting through the\r\nobbligato treatment of the wind instruments, the flute competing with\r\nthe voice in passages. Joh. Bapt. Becke (b. 1743), who had been trained\r\nunder Wendling to become an admirable flautist, was summoned from Munich\r\nfor this performance. The third air (13) is in the serious conventional\r\nstyle, not wanting in dignity.\r\n\r\nMore individuality is given to the parts of Aminta and Elisa; at first\r\nthe prevailing element is pastoral, as was usual in festival operas. The\r\noverture, consisting of one movement (Molto allegro) leads directly to\r\nAminta's first song (1), by a pleasant pastoral melody. It is a simple\r\nshepherd's song characterised by its 6-8 time, and by the flute and\r\nhorn accompaniment. For the better contentment of the singer (the\r\nsoprano Consoli from Munich), his second song is a genuine bravura (3).\r\nIn its division into a brilliant Allegro aperto (4-4), and an elegant\r\nGrazioso (3-8), as well as in details, the old style is apparent; but\r\nall is so much freer, fuller, and, in spite of its fragmentary\r\n\r\n{\"IL RE PASTORE\"--THE DIFFERENT PARTS.}\r\n\r\n(229)\r\n\r\nconstruction, so much more connected, that one feels a new spirit\r\nfloating through the obsolete forms. Aminta's last air (10), when he\r\ndeclares himself true to his love, shakes itself quite loose from the\r\nfetters. It has the rondo form; the principal theme, twice relieved by\r\nan interlude, recurs three times, and winds up with a coda. The beauty\r\nof this cantilene is enhanced by a violin solo (written doubtless\r\nfor Brunetti) equally simple and tuneful in style. The muted strings\r\naccompany the principal subject with a slightly agitated passage; the\r\nwind instruments (two flutes, two English horns, two bassoons, and two\r\nhorns) are treated independently, and as delicately and tenderly as the\r\ntone of the piece requires.\r\n\r\nElisa's first song (2) unites in a singular degree the pastoral with the\r\nbravura character: the noble lady depicts the happiness of living as a\r\nshepherdess near her beloved Aminta. The traditional form has been\r\nso skilfully modified, and an almost playful grace is so freshly and\r\ncharmingly expressed, that this song may justly be placed on a level\r\nwith some of Mozart's later concert songs. The second air (8) is more\r\nstrictly according to rule; the situation does not lend itself to\r\nfreedom of treatment, and Mozart has contented himself with composing a\r\nharmonious and effective song.\r\n\r\nThe duet between Elisa and Aminta at the close of the first act (7) is\r\nlight and pleasing, surpassing former efforts of the same kind in its\r\nclever management of the voices and in the originality of its subject.\r\nIt is a charming idea and an appropriate one, to carry on the subject of\r\nthe Andante with altered rhythm into the Allegro.\r\n\r\nThe parts of Tamiri and Agenore are quite secondary, scarcely more than\r\nstop-gaps. Tamiri's first air (6) is a bravura song of the ordinary\r\ntype, the second (11) is almost soubrette-like in its airy lightness.\r\nAgenore's first air (5) is tender and pleasing, not much in accord with\r\nthe situation. His second air (12) is pathetic, in a minor key, and\r\nstands alone of its kind. Restless agitation is portrayed by a varied\r\nand striking harmony, emphasised by\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S SONGS.}\r\n\r\n(230)\r\n\r\nstrongly accented chords for the wind instruments--four horns besides\r\noboes and bassoons. But neither the character of Agenore nor the\r\nmoralising words give any opening for pathos.\r\n\r\nThe finale consists of a brilliant four-part tutti movement, which is\r\nrepeated entire, or in part, several times; passages for single voices\r\nare inserted, alternating cleverly and with a pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nMozart's evident longing to break loose from the fetters of\r\nconventionality and tradition is nowhere more apparent than in the\r\naccompaniment and in the orchestral movements, where we find a fulness\r\nand freedom of thought hitherto only shown in detached passages. Even\r\nwhen the old fashion is retained of employing only oboes and horns,\r\nthere is an evident appreciation of the special powers of the\r\ninstruments expressed, it may be, in a few notes. The orchestra has its\r\nown significance, and Mozart turns to account his intimate knowledge of\r\nthe orchestra of opera seria. Trifling as these instrumental effects may\r\nappear, the main point, that instrumental music was henceforth to\r\ntake an active part both in serious and comic opera, was one of great\r\nimportance in the history of their development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Metastasio cites Justinian (XI., 10) and Curtius (IV., 3), who\r\nrelate that Alexander set on the throne of Sidon a distant descendant of\r\nthe royal house, Abdalonymus, who was living in poverty as a gardener,\r\nbut who was worthy of the honour by reason of his beautiful form and\r\nnoble mind.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The care with which Metastasio avoids this discordant name (un nome\r\nipocondriaco) is characteristic.

SONGS.\r\n\r\nWE must here cast a glance at a number of separate songs composed by\r\nMozart, either for insertion in operas or for performance at concerts.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of them, composed for the two Licenze at Salzburg (p. 99),\r\nand those belonging to the first Italian journey, call for no special\r\nremark. Yet there occurs in the air composed at Rome, \"Se tutti i mali\r\nmiei\" (183 K.), a change of key produced by enharmomic progression which\r\ndeserves to be noticed:--\r\n\r\n{BUFFO SONGS, 1775-76.}\r\n\r\n(231)\r\n\r\n[See Page Image] No such songs are known to belong to the years\r\nimmediately following, but in 1775 we find several composed at Salzburg,\r\nprobably for performance by foreign vocalists visiting the city. Two\r\ntenor airs belong to May, 1775. In one of them, described as \"Aria\r\nbuffa\" (210 K.) the singer is supposed to be flattering some one to his\r\nface with the greatest fluency, while he makes all sorts of rude remarks\r\naside:--\r\n\r\n     Con ossequio, con rispetto\r\n     Io m' inchio e mi profondo\r\n     A un sapiente si perfetto,\r\n     Che l' egual non v' è nel mondo,\r\n     E l' eguale non verrà--\r\n     Per l' orgoglio e l' ignoranza e la gran bestialità.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra maintains a single theme (Allegro assai) without\r\nintermission, and the voice is almost throughout _parlando_ in rapid\r\nvivacity; the union of a certain amount of dignity with burlesque\r\nfluency of tongue is very comical, the whole song being simply conceived\r\nand easily and consistently worked out. This song could only have been\r\nmeant for performance on the stage, and the second (209 K.), \"Si mostra\r\nla sorte propizia all' amante,\" is scarcely of importance enough for a\r\nconcert-room. It is the complaint of a bashful lover, but has so little\r\npathos as to be only\r\n\r\n{SONGS.}\r\n\r\n(232)\r\n\r\nsuitable for opera buffa. It is simple both in design and execution, and\r\nmay have been inserted to suit the powers of some singer in the place of\r\nanother song. It was no doubt also for insertion in an opera buffa that\r\nan air for Dorina (217 K.), \"Voi avete un cor fidele,\" was composed\r\n(October 26, 1775); it is in the style of a soubrette, superior to those\r\nof its kind in the \"Finta Giardiniera,\" and equal to Despina's songs\r\nin \"Cosi fan tutti.\" An Andantino grazioso and an Allegro, the latter\r\nconsiderably elaborated, are both repeated, then a few bars of the\r\nAndantino recur, and the whole is wound up by rather a long Coda in\r\nallegro. The exact repetition of both movements makes the effect of\r\nthe whole somewhat stiff, but the details are fresh, animated, and very\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nThe tone of melting tenderness at the beginning, the mocking _parlando_\r\nof the questions, and finally the fervency of the words, \"Ah! non\r\ncredo,\" are so strikingly expressed, and the whole effect is so cheerful\r\nand even droll, that we cannot fail to recognise the hand of a master\r\nof his art. The subjects and the passages in the allegro are neat and\r\ngraceful, and the orchestral parts are lively and appropriate.\r\n\r\nA tenor song (256 K.), \"Clarice cara mia sposa,\" composed for Signor\r\nPalmini, September, 1776, is a true theatrical buffo air, and\r\nbears lively testimony to Mozart's comic talent. A Capitano prates\r\nnonsensically, with much swagger, of how he will have his own way in\r\nspite of everybody; a Don Timoteo seeks in vain to interrupt the flow\r\nof his talk, which seems to run over in an unintermittent succession of\r\ntriplets falling like heavy rain, and, as it were, drenching the hearer\r\nin an instant.\r\n\r\nThe monotonous _parlando_ is provided with just so much of melody as\r\nto indicate that it is sung, not spoken. The orchestra maintains a very\r\nsimple subject--[See Page Image] with varied harmonies, in a light, even\r\nsketchy manner, but with considerable musical interest. Even the few\r\nwords in\r\n\r\n{ALTO SONG, 1776.}\r\n\r\n(233)\r\n\r\nrecitative, thrown in by Don Timoteo, do not allow the singer to take\r\nbreath, and only serve to make the next paroxysm still more comical.\r\n\r\nAnother song, composed in the same month for the alto Fortini, may have\r\nbeen intended for performance at a concert. Mozart justly considered\r\nthis song worthy to live, for he writes from Vienna (April 12, 1783)\r\nto beg that the rondo for an alto voice may be sent to him which he had\r\ncomposed when the Italian troupe were at Salzburg. The idea is the usual\r\none of the leave-taking of a disconsolate lover. The introduction is a\r\nnot very long, but an expressive recitative. The transition from this\r\nto the air itself is charming and very touching; it is the involuntary\r\nexpression of the pain of parting welling out from the innermost depths\r\nof the heart:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nBoth the movements of the song, Andante moderato and Allegro assai,\r\nare repeated; then the Andante recurs for the third time, makes its way\r\nthrough an Allegretto to the Allegro assai, and from this a subject is\r\nselected, which leads through an effective crescendo to a pause on the\r\n\r\n{SONGS.}\r\n\r\n(234)\r\n\r\nseventh. Then the opening bars of the Andante are repeated, stop short,\r\nand the song is rapidly concluded 'by the Allegro. The hesitation and\r\nirresolution of the lover, who cannot bring himself to depart,\r\nfind ready expression in this change of movement. A deep, calm, and\r\nrestrained emotion, corresponding admirably to the character of an alto\r\nvoice, is well portrayed by the simple, unornamented song, interrupted\r\nonly by the stronger accents of intense grief. The orchestral\r\naccompaniment is so managed as skilfully to heighten the peculiar effect\r\nof an alto voice.\r\n\r\nRepeated mention is made in the letters of the year 1777, and\r\nafterwards, of a scena composed for Madame Duschek.[1] In the summer of\r\n1777, Josepha Duschek, a singer and pianoforte-player of celebrity, and\r\na young, vivacious woman, came for a visit from Prague to Salzburg. The\r\nfoundation was laid of a friendship with Wolfgang, of which we shall\r\nfrequently have occasion to speak. The scena in question is probably the\r\ngrand aria of Andromeda (272 K.), \"Ah, lo previdi,\" belonging to August,\r\n1776, not long before his departure from Salzburg, and one of the\r\ngreatest compositions of the kind. An agitated recitative is followed\r\nby a long, elaborate Allegro, expressive of the passion of a brave and\r\nnoble mind. Scorn for perfidy overpowers even pain at the loss of the\r\nbeloved one; tones which seem to scorch and wither pour forth like\r\nglowing metal on the betrayer; then comes a subject which has already\r\nmade itself heard more than once in the orchestra as a cry of suppressed\r\npain, and this leads to a gentler mood; grief for the lost love is\r\nexpressed in a beautiful recitative, and dies away into calm and\r\ncomposed melancholy with a Cavatina, which concludes the scena.\r\n\r\nThe psychological truth of the details, the blending of the transitions,\r\nthe unity of the tone, are qualities quite as much to be admired in this\r\nsong as the musical originality and skill\r\n\r\n{\"AH, LO PREVIDI,\" 1777--LIEDER.}\r\n\r\n(235)\r\n\r\ndisplayed in its composition. The last movement is perhaps a little\r\nspun out; although the strain of long-continued violent emotion seems to\r\nrequire a correspondingly gradual cessation.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra is as simply managed as in the earlier songs; for wind\r\ninstruments only horns, bassoons and oboes are employed, with,\r\nmore seldom, flutes; in the recitatives there are only stringed\r\ninstruments.[2]\r\n\r\nIt is indicative of the taste of the time that among so many vocal\r\ncompositions the song proper (_lied_) seldom or never appears. Five very\r\nsimple Lieder with clavier accompaniments belong to the earlier Salzburg\r\nepoch (147-151 K.); they are more pedantic than any other of the\r\ncompositions, and interest us chiefly through the words by Günther and\r\nCanitz, which Mozart has selected for composition.\r\n\r\nHE years of Mozart's development at Salzburg were fruitful not only of\r\noperatic compositions, but of others which arose from the circumstances\r\nof his residence there. First among these stands church music.\r\n\r\nChurch music had long been fostered at Salzburg, and was especially\r\nencouraged by Archbishop Sigismund; his severe and world-contemning\r\npiety caused him to keep the service of the church continually before\r\nthe eyes both of singers and composers. The prospect of a moderate\r\npension induced many clever artists to settle in Salzburg, in spite\r\nof the poor payment they received for their services. Sigismund's\r\nsuccessor,\r\n\r\nHieronymus, extended his parsimony even to the members of the Kapelle,\r\nwhom he estranged by his overbearing manners; on the whole, music rather\r\ndeclined than advanced under his rule,[3] although he cared more than\r\nSigismund for the splendour of his court.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOOTNOTES OF CHAPTER 13\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: His father tells him (December 15, 1780) that Fr. Duschek considered\r\nherself indebted to him for the former song, and pressed for another,\r\nwhich he had refused as impossible at that time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A song (119 K.) printed only with German words, \"Der Liebe\r\nhimmlisches Gefuhl,\" is a bravura song in the old style, of undoubted\r\nearly Italian origin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: [Koch-Stemfeld] Die leiten dreissig Jahre des Erzbisthums Salzburg,\r\np. 255.

CHURCH MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTEEN choristers were maintained at the cost of the Archbishop in the\r\nKapellhaus, and educated by\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(236)\r\n\r\nspecial instructors. They afterwards entered the choir as singers or\r\npassed into the service of the court; if they showed extraordinary\r\ntalent, they were sent to finish their training in Italy, and then took\r\ntheir place as solo singers.[3] Archbishop Sigis-mund allowed the male\r\nsopranos to die out, and did not replace them with others; on the other\r\nhand he sent the daughter of the cathedral organist, Maria Magd. Lipp,\r\nto be educated as a singer in Italy, and on her return in 1762 he\r\nappointed her court singer; she soon afterwards married Michael Haydn,\r\nlately arrived at Salzburg. In 1778 Hieronymus again took a male soprano\r\ninto his service, Ant. Ceccarelli, a singer of moderate powers and bad\r\nmoral character.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra belonging to the choir was an ample one for the time, and\r\nwas strengthened by a trumpet band for the support of the voices in the\r\nchurch. There were further two bands of six trumpets and drums, which\r\ndid not properly belong to the court, but to the chamberlain's office,\r\nand which ranked between the equerries and the lackeys.[4] But no one\r\nwas taken into this service who could not also, at need, strengthen the\r\nstringed instruments.\r\n\r\nIn 1762, when Lolli was kapellmeister, and Leopold Mozart\r\nvice-kapellmeister, Joh.Michael Haydn[5] (1737-1806), the younger\r\nbrother of Joseph, was appointed concertmeister and director of the\r\norchestra, on the recommendation of a\r\n\r\n{MICHAEL HAYDN.}\r\n\r\n(237)\r\n\r\nnephew of Archbishop Sigismund, at Grosswardein, where Haydn had been\r\nkapellmeister since 1757. The personal intercourse between the families\r\nof Haydn and Mozart was not over friendly. Haydn was fond of sitting\r\nover a glass of beer or wine, which was all the more reprehensible in\r\nthe sight of the temperate and conscientious Mozart, since it caused\r\nfrequent neglect of duty.\r\n\r\n\"Who do you think,\" he writes to Wolfgang (December 29,1777), \"is\r\nappointed organist at the Holy Trinity? Herr Haydn! Every one laughs.\r\nHe is an expensive organist; after every litany he drinks a quartern of\r\nwine, and he sends Lipp to the extra services, who drinks too.\" (June\r\n29, 1778): \"This afternoon Haydn played the organ for the litany and the\r\nTe Deum (at which the Archbishop was present), but so badly that we were\r\nall horrified.... Haydn will drink himself to death soon; or at least,\r\nbeing lazy enough already, he will become still lazier the older he\r\ngets.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Frau Haydn also must have been objectionable. Wolfgang\r\nwrites mockingly to Bullinger (August 7, 1778): \"It is quite true that\r\nHaydn's wife is ill; she has carried her rigours too far; there are few\r\nlike her! I only wonder that she has not lost her voice long ago through\r\nher constant scourgings, wearing of sackcloth, prolonged fasts, and\r\nmidnight prayers.\" Neither was Haydn's cultivation such as to cause L.\r\nMozart to wish for nearer intercourse between the families. \"I should\r\nlike to hear him speak Italian in Italy,\" he writes (December 4,\r\n1777); \"the people would certainly say, 'Questo è un vero Tedesco!\"'[7]\r\nPersonal difference and trifling jealousies, such as easily arise in\r\nsmall communities, may have had some influence on this unfavourable\r\ncriticism of Michael Haydn; it did not extend, however, to his merits as\r\nan artist. It is true that L. Mozart was of opinion when Michael Haydn,\r\nin 1787, composed the opera \"Andromeda e Perseo,\" that he had no talent\r\nfor\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(238)\r\n\r\ndramatic music, and that his principal songs might have been written for\r\na choir-boy. But he praised, in strong terms, the _entr'acte_ music\r\nfor Zaire, which Haydn had composed in 1777, and analysed it carefully,\r\ntelling his son that the Archbishop had done him the honour to say to\r\nhim at table, that he could not have believed Haydn capable of composing\r\nsuch music; and that instead of beer he should drink nothing but\r\nBurgundy. Haydn received a reward of six kronthaler (October 1 and\r\nOctober 9, 1777). But when L. Mozart writes to his son: \"Herr Haydn is a\r\nman whose musical merits you will not deny\" (September 24, 1778), he\r\nis referring to his church music, which Wolfgang was in the habit\r\nof copying for study. Writing from Vienna, he asks for \"small paper,\r\nEberlin's Counterpoint, bound in blue, and some of Haydn's things\";[8]\r\nand shortly after (March 12, 1783): \"The 'Tres sunt' (M. Haydn's) is\r\nin score, in my handwriting.\" He wanted these things for the Sunday\r\nperformances at Van Swieten's, and asked also for Michael Haydn's latest\r\nfugue. \"The 'Lauda Sion,'\" he writes (March 12, 1783), \"was a great\r\nsuccess; the fugue, 'In Te Domine speravi,' was much admired, as also\r\nthe 'Ave Maria' and 'Tenebrae.'\" Among Mozart's remains were found\r\ntwo fugues, 'Pignus futuræ gloriæ,' copied by his own hand from Michael\r\nHaydn's Litanies.\r\n\r\n{ADLGASSER--CHURCH FORMS.}\r\n\r\n(239)\r\n\r\nThe cathedral organist, appointed in 1751, was Anton Cajetan Adlgasser\r\n(1728--1777), a pupil of Eberlin, who had been sent by the Archbishop to\r\nstudy in Italy, a first-rate organ-player and accompanist, whose\r\nsacred compositions were afterwards performed and highly appreciated\r\nat Salzburg. Less remarkable was the second organist, Franz Ign. Lipp,\r\nHaydn's father-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe kapellmeister and organist did not confine themselves to conducting\r\nperformances of church music: they made it a point of honour to\r\nprovide suitable music for special festival occasions. At such time new\r\ncompositions were considered indispensable; indeed, throughout the year\r\na constant variety of music was sought to be provided. This activity in\r\nchurch music was of the greatest service to young composers, who\r\nnever wanted an opportunity for bringing out new compositions, nor for\r\nlearning by hearing and comparing.\r\n\r\nIt was not the less beneficial in the way of training that they were\r\nobliged to keep within the limits of certain clearly defined forms,\r\nand to be content with the often scanty means which they found ready\r\nto hand. Through the influence of transmitted customs and individual\r\npeculiarities, as well as of the taste of those in authority, local\r\ntraditions grew up, whose narrow rules hindered freedom of development.\r\nSuch control is most irksome in church matters, wherein all, even\r\nwhat is in itself unimportant, must be considered as partaking of the\r\nsanctity of the whole. The counterbalancing gain of such training is\r\ntechnical finish, the indispensable foundation for the development of\r\ngenius, with which alone can any effort to break loose from what is\r\nfalse in tradition be successful.\r\n\r\nMozart found the rules and forms of church music as clearly defined as\r\nthose of the opera. Both had been formed in the Neapolitan school,\r\nand the impulses given up each had been in the same direction. The\r\nturning-point was the introduction of melodies which had their own\r\nsignificance as expressions of emotion, without regard to their harmonic\r\nor contrapuntal treatment. No sooner had melody gained recognition in\r\nopera and cantata, as the natural and\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(240)\r\n\r\nlegitimate form of musical expression, than it made a way for itself into the\r\nchurch by means of oratorio. The simple grandeur of the older church\r\nmusic (particularly that of the Roman school, with Palestrina as its\r\nrepresentative) depended chiefly on the fact that the chorus of\r\nvoices was treated as an organic whole, of which no one part could be\r\nrecognised as a distinct entity apart from the rest. The impression made\r\nby such music resembles that of the sea. Wave follows upon wave, and\r\neach one seems to be like the last; yet underlying the apparent monotony\r\nthere exists an ever-varied life, an invincible strength, manifesting\r\nitself alike in peaceful calm and raging storm, and filling the mind\r\nwith a sense of sublimity and grandeur, without satiety and without\r\nfatigue. But so soon as one melody was distinguished above the rest the\r\nunion and equality of the voices was disturbed. Separate voices became\r\nmore or less prominent as occasion required; and it could not fail to\r\nfollow that the other voices should be employed merely to fill up and\r\nsupport the principal melody. A certain amount of independence and\r\ncharacter might indeed be given to the accompanying voices by skilful\r\nmanagement, but the principle remains unaltered, so long as a melody and\r\nits accompaniment are in question.\r\n\r\nThe change became more marked when instrumental music gained admission\r\ninto the church. At first the organ and trumpets were employed merely to\r\nsupport and strengthen the voices. But when stringed instruments, and by\r\ndegrees the various wind instruments of the orchestra, came into use\r\nin churches, they gradually adopted in church music, as in secular, the\r\npart of accompaniment to the voices. This tendency was most apparent of\r\ncourse in solo singing; but a manner of orchestral accompaniment to the\r\nchoruses was gradually elaborated which could not fail to influence\r\nthe treatment of the voice parts. The use of the severest contrapuntal\r\nmethod had hitherto been considered an essential condition and\r\nembellishment of church music; but on this point also an alteration of\r\nopinion and taste gained gradual ground.\r\n\r\nThe perfection of contrapuntal treatment, consisting in the absolute\r\nfreedom and independence of the several parts,\r\n\r\n{COUNTERPOINT IN CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(241)\r\n\r\nwith their due correlation, can only be obtained by strict obedience\r\nto well-defined laws; added to which must be a firm conception of some\r\nsimple fundamental idea whose many-sided development shall give unity\r\nand cohesion to the whole work. This form of composition is therefore\r\npeculiarly appropriate to the delivery of serious and weighty ideas; it\r\nis however but a form, and can be endued with life and significance only\r\nby the matter which it contains, and by the spirit which animates it.\r\nIn old times the madrigal served to illustrate contrapuntal forms in\r\nsecular music; and even in the present day canons and fugues, sometimes\r\nwith comic effect, sometimes giving expression to very varied emotions,\r\nare often so skilfully constructed that the uninitiated have no\r\nsuspicion of the artistic learning with the effect of which they are\r\ncharmed. Although counterpoint is in itself neither spiritual nor\r\necclesiastical, it is conceivable that in proportion as secular music\r\nfreed itself from the trammels, the error should arise of imagining\r\nseverity of form and structure to be peculiarly appropriate to church\r\nmusic. This identification of counterpoint with ecclesiastical ideas\r\ncaused its development to proceed side by side with those other forms\r\nwhich had made good their footing in church music. The opposition which\r\nwas felt to exist between severe methods and methods not severe led to\r\na compromise; certain parts of the liturgical text were treated\r\ncontrapuntally, and others freely. The proportions depended greatly on\r\npersonal and local influences, but the main points of the division were\r\ndecided by the Neapolitan school.\r\n\r\nThe moral tendency of this change of construction must not be\r\noverlooked. The free treatment of melody gave to subjective emotion,\r\nwith its ever-varying alternations, a suitable method of musical\r\nexpression, and an art which was developing in this direction must have\r\nhad extraordinary influence. The effort to make church music subject to\r\nthis influence was the necessary consequence of a newly awakened life in\r\nart. The musician felt himself impelled to represent religious emotion\r\nin its full strength and truth, and with all the means at his command;\r\nthe liturgy called forth the expression of the liveliest and most\r\npassionate emotion, it\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(242)\r\n\r\noffered opportunities for representing the most vivid dramatic\r\nsituations; even the glory of worship called on its votaries to bring\r\nthe splendour of music, as well as of painting and sculpture, into the\r\nDivine service. But the direction taken by the intellectual progress\r\nof that time, especially in Italy, was fraught with the dangers which\r\ninvariably threaten an art which is struggling to free itself from\r\ntradition. The Church was tolerant towards the aspirations of art, so\r\nlong as they afforded an effective means for her glorification, but she\r\nsternly repressed any efforts to break loose from the fetters of her\r\nordinances and customs. On the other hand, men rejoiced in what had\r\nbeen so easily and rapidly gained, and satisfied themselves with the\r\nsuperficial freedom which they had attained. Proportionally was the\r\ndevelopment of a formalism in accordance with the Italian character,\r\nwhich seeks for beauty always in set forms, and demanded the adoption of\r\nsuch forms by church music. The opera was the model; thence sprang the\r\nmoral and artistic element which became manifest in the forms of church\r\nmusic, appealing not so much to the faith of the congregation as to the\r\ntaste of musical connoisseurs. Any attempt to transport operatic forms\r\ndirectly into church music was forbidden by the liturgical form\r\nof Divine service, to which the music must be subordinate. But the\r\nconnection was severed with the old church modes from which ancient\r\nchurch music borrowed its subjects, treating them after a long since\r\nobsolete tone-system; and a merely devotional musical symbolism was\r\nrenounced for the freedom of original creation. For though subjects\r\nwere borrowed in later times from the old church modes, they lost their\r\nsignificance when detached, and were, besides, treated according to the\r\nnew lights. Finally, the sway of the singer was mighty in church music\r\nas elsewhere. The habit of delighting in the finished performances\r\nof the vocalist was united with the idea that he who could most fully\r\nsatisfy the prevailing taste was also the most worthy to serve the Most\r\nHigh and to exalt the glory of worship. We shall therefore find the\r\nchurch music of the latter half of the eighteenth century composed\r\nof the same materials as operatic music, and exercising much the same\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC IN GERMANY.}\r\n\r\n(243)\r\n\r\nThe same influence which had been won by Italian operatic music in\r\nGermany penetrated to the churches of Catholic Germany, and attained to\r\ncomplete sovereignty. But there was a difference, important, though not\r\nat the time generally or consciously felt. The conception and mode of\r\nexpression of Italian church music was, although secularised, yet in its\r\nessence national, and in its appeals to religious emotion it might count\r\nupon universal comprehension and sympathy.\r\n\r\nBut transplanted to Germany both the ideas and their mode of execution\r\nwere strange, and could only be adopted after a preliminary artistic\r\ntraining; what in Italy had grown up in the course of national\r\ndevelopment was transmitted to Germany as mere form. The delicate\r\nsense of beauty and of grace, the excitable, passionate nature of the\r\nItalians, could not be transplanted, and the external adjuncts were\r\neven more superficially treated than on the soil from which they sprang.\r\nContrapuntal work, especially the fugue, was haunted by the school\r\ntraditions of church usages, which conduced to a spiritless formalism\r\nof routine. Thus, carelessness and pedantry, superficiality and dulness\r\nwere combined, and church music declined more rapidly and visibly than\r\nthe opera. The difference between the true essence and its extinct form\r\nis the more apparent and significant the deeper it lies; and to this\r\nmust be added the fact that the continuous demand for church music' gave\r\nrise to the production of a mass of inferior work, from which the opera\r\nwas preserved in deference to the taste of the public. Under these\r\ncircumstances it was impossible even for a surpassing genius to do\r\nmore than distinguish himself in some particulars; the efforts of\r\nan individual after thorough-going reform could only be successful\r\nsupported by the spirit of the age and of the nation.[9]\r\n\r\nThis general position held by church music was modified in different\r\nregions by local peculiarities of the liturgy, by the tastes of church\r\nauthorities, and by the differences in the\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(244)\r\n\r\nmusical forces at command. The peculiar circumstances under which Mozart\r\nwrote in Salzburg are described by himself in a letter to Padre Martini\r\n(September 4, 1776):[10]--\r\n\r\nI live in a place where music prospers but little, although we have some\r\ngood musicians, and some especially good composers of thorough knowledge\r\nand taste. The theatre suffers for want of singers; we have few male\r\nsopranos, and are not likely to have more, for they require high pay,\r\nand over-liberality is not our weak point. I busy myself with writing\r\nchurch and chamber music, and we have two capital contrapuntists, Haydn\r\nand Adlgasser. My father is kapellmeister at the metropolitan church,\r\nwhich gives me the opportunity of writing as much as I like for the\r\nchurch. But as my father has been thirty-six years in the service of the\r\ncourt, and knows that the Archbishop does not care to have people of\r\nan advanced age about him, he takes things quietly and devotes himself\r\nchiefly to literature, which has always been his favourite study. Our\r\nchurch music differs widely and increasingly from that of Italy.\r\n\r\nA mass, with Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, the Sonata at the Epistle, the\r\nOffertorium or Motett, Sanctus and Agnus Dei, must not last longer than\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, even on festivals when the Archbishop himself\r\nofficiates. This kind of composition requires special study. And yet the\r\nmass must have all the instruments, trumpets, drums, &c. Ah, if we were\r\nnot so far from each other, how much I should have to tell you!\r\n\r\nWe have further information on the arrangements made for church music in\r\nthe cathedral.[11] \"The cathedral contains a large organ at the back by\r\nthe entrance, four side organs in front of the choir, and a little choir\r\norgan below the choir where the choristers sit. The large organ is only\r\nused on grand occasions and for preludes; during the performance one of\r\nthe four side organs is played, generally that next to the altar on\r\nthe right side, where the solo singers and basses are. Opposite, by the\r\nleft-side organ, are the violinists, &c., and on the two other sides\r\nare two choruses of trumpets and drums. The lower choir organ and\r\ndouble-bass join in when required.\"[12]\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S MASSES.}\r\n\r\n(245)\r\n\r\nAmong Mozart's compositions for the Church, his masses.[13] by reason\r\nof their importance in Divine service, take the first place.[14] In\r\nthe divisions of the several parts, we find him following in the beaten\r\ntrack of the Neapolitan school. The different parts of the text coincide\r\nwith the prescribed pauses made by the officiating priest, but are\r\nvery differently worked out.[15] Where the composer has free scope,\r\nthe separate sections are usually treated as independent pieces, with\r\nregular alternations of solo and chorus. But such elaborate masses\r\nwere only performed on solemn occasions (Missa solemnis) or through the\r\npreference of an influential personage--they took up too much time for\r\nthe regular service.\r\n\r\nIn the short mass (Missa brevis) the larger divisions were treated in\r\nthe main as a connected musical movement of which the separate sections\r\nwere detached indeed, but not independent of each other; the degree of\r\nconnection is of course very varied.\r\n\r\nThe thrice-repeated cry, \"Kyrie eleison! Christe eleison! Kyrie\r\neleison!\" is regularly developed into a lengthy movement. It was\r\nformerly the custom[16] to prefix a short, slow and solemn movement on\r\nthe words \"Kyrie eleison,\" to an agitated more elaborate one[17] (49,\r\n65,66, K.); but afterwards the whole became one movement. The prayer for\r\nthe mercy of God is animated, and though devoid of depth, never sinks to\r\nmere trifling. A more serious mood is generally indicated by the severer\r\ncontrapuntal treatment of the voices (192, 194, 262, K). The words\r\n\"Christe eleison\" are regularly accentuated, usually with an expression\r\nof beseeching melancholy, and often by solo voices. The solo voices and\r\nchoruses generally alternate in the Kyrie.\r\n\r\nThe Gloria[18] is divided into several movements,\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(246)\r\n\r\nconformably to the successive invocations of which it consists. The\r\ncharacter of the whole is one of exulting praise, the tone being\r\nindicated by the opening words, \"Gloria in excelsis Deo.\" The effort to\r\nexpress the solemn dignity of divine worship by external splendour, is\r\napparent in the animated, fervent, and often stately progress of this\r\nmovement. The opening subject is revived at appointed places, usually at\r\nthe Quoniam, and forms a connecting thread throughout the piece. A solo\r\nis often introduced at the words \"Lau-damus Te and, even without much\r\nintentional expression, the four commas of the words, \"Laudamus Te,\r\nbenedicimus Te, adoramus Te, glorificamus Te,\" form natural pauses, and\r\nregulate the musical and rhythmical division of the passage.\r\n\r\nBut the contrast of solo and chorus is determined less by the sense of\r\nthe words than by the necessities of art, requiring variations of light\r\nand shade. As a rule, the words of highest import are given to the\r\nchorus; the solos serve for ornament, or as a preparation for a chorus\r\nof renewed and increased strength.\r\n\r\nThe central point of this part of the mass is formed by the\r\nthrice-repeated cry:--\r\n\r\n    Qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis!\r\n    Qui tollis peccata mundi, suscipe deprecationem nostram!\r\n    Qui sedes ad dexteram patris, miserere nobis\r\n\r\nHere we have a mood expressed of deep agitation, offering excellent\r\nopportunity for musical treatment, both in feeling and form. The \"Qui\r\ntollis\" is the nucleus of all Mozart's Glorias; he enunciates it simply\r\nenough through the chorus, relying for effect on the charm of rich and\r\noriginal harmonies, as bold in conception as they are clear and decided\r\nin rendering. The words which follow, \"Quoniam Tu solus sanctus, Tu\r\nsolus Dominus, Tu solus altissimus, Jesu Christe,\" are\r\n\r\n{GLORIA--CREDO.}\r\n\r\n(247)\r\n\r\ntreated as a song of praise,[19] in order to relieve the gloom of the\r\n\"Qui tollis,\" and to give stronger emphasis to what is to follow. For\r\nthe last words, \"cum Sancto Spiritu in gloria Dei Patris, Amen,\" are\r\ntreated without regard to the context, as an independent fugue. In\r\nMozart's early masses the fugue is short (49, 65, K.), but they\r\nsoon became long and often elaborate (60,115,139,167,192, 262, K.).\r\nArchbishop Hieronymus, however, had an aversion to fugues; and in\r\nMozart's later masses the Gloria came to an end in a short choral\r\npassage (220, 257, 258, 259, K.).\r\n\r\nThe Credo offered the greatest difficulties to musical treatment. A long\r\nmovement, whose several parts are dependent on one emphatic verb placed\r\nat the beginning, cannot be musically rendered in such a way that the\r\nconnection remains apparent to the hearer; each phrase disturbs the\r\ngrammatical construction of the period. In order to overcome this\r\ndifficulty the word \"credo\" was repeated at fitting points (192,257,\r\nK).[20] But although logical requirements are thus to a certain degree\r\nsatisfied, the repeated \"credo\" does not fit into the grammatical\r\nstructure, and the contrast between the spoken and the musical\r\nexpression is in reality only intensified.\r\n\r\nIn close connection with this is the further difficulty that the\r\ndelarations of faith belong essentially to the domain of speculation,\r\nand can rarely work directly on the feelings; neither does the form\r\ninto which they are thrown incite the fancy to musical expression.\r\nThese difficulties might be surmounted at a time when music with all\r\nher powers and capacities placed herself unreservedly at the disposal\r\nof worship, accepting the prescribed words with perfect faith in\r\ntheir sanctity, and only anxious to give them their fullest and truest\r\nexpression. There was as little question of\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(248)\r\n\r\nindividuality in art as in faith; the unquestioned law of ecclesiastical\r\ninfallibility impressed on every work the stamp of the subjection of\r\nart to religion. Even the forms of the music followed the ancient and\r\nhallowed traditions of the cultus, and embodied ecclesiastical formulas\r\nin strict counterpoint. But as by degrees subjective emotion and\r\nexpression gained ground in church music, and as the old severity of\r\nform gave place to a wealth of means and expedients, the ecclesiastical\r\ntext fell under the criticism of the musicians, who subjected it to the\r\ntest of the conditions required for the production of a perfect work of\r\nart. Composers learned to look upon the Credo as material to be worked\r\nup into an artistic musical form, even when it did not lend itself\r\neasily to the process. A sort of type was gradually evolved, that was\r\nclosely adhered to in many particulars. One such, for instance, is the\r\nstrong accentuation of death in the words, \"judicare vivos et mortuos,\"\r\nand \"resurrectionem mortuo-rum,\" the tone-painting of the \"descendit de\r\ncoelis,\" the repetition of the \"non\" in the words \"cujus regni non\r\nerit finis,\" and others of the same kind. Such an evident tendency to\r\nemphasise details at the cost of the whole, only shows how composers\r\ntook refuge in whatever was capable of musical expression, in order to\r\nextricate themselves as far as they could from the burden of the rest.\r\n\r\nThe main passages on which the musical strength of the Credo was\r\nconcentrated are those in which the mention of the incarnation,\r\ncrucifixion, and resurrection of Christ appeal most vividly to the\r\nsenses and the imagination. It had become customary to connect the\r\nwords, \"Qui propter nos homines et propter nostram salutem descendit de\r\ncoelis,\" whether made prominent by solo singing or not, with those which\r\npreceded them, and to make a pause with \"Et incarnatus.\"[21] These\r\nwords are generally rendered by a tender solo voice, as if they would\r\nfain hover round the cradle of the heavenly Child, to express the\r\ngratitude of mankind for his incarnation. Then solemnly and sadly the\r\nchorus depicts\r\n\r\n{CREDO.}\r\n\r\n(249)\r\n\r\nthe deep pain of \"Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Pontio Pilato, passus\r\net sepultus est,\" breaking out at \"Et resur-rexit\" &c., into joyful\r\ntrust in the resurrection. In all this Mozart's wonderful genius\r\nsucceeded in awakening imagination and emotion which, again, his\r\nartistic moderation knew how to calm; his firm grasp of his art enabling\r\nhim to produce the most striking effect with the simplest means, and\r\nto gather up the details, so that each sustains and elevates the other\r\nwithout injuring the consistency of the whole Credo. This unusual\r\ncombination of qualities gives to this part of the mass a high degree of\r\nartistic finish even when the treatment is most simple and confined.\r\n\r\nThe words \"Et in Spiritum Sanctum\" are usually given to a solo\r\nvoice,--more, however, from custom than for any special signification of\r\ntheir own (49, 65, 139, K.); they are introduced by a long instrumental\r\nprelude (262 K.). Apart from the interests of the Church, which might\r\nhave some influence here, the necessity could not but be felt for\r\na strong contrast between this and the following passages. For what\r\nfollows, \"Et unam sanctam catholicam et apos-tolicam ecclesiam,\" &c.,\r\nis given by the whole strength of the chorus. The last words, \"et vitam\r\nventuri saeculi. Amen,\" is again treated as a fugue. Here, again, we\r\nfind first a short fugued movement (49, 65, 192, K.), but later a long\r\nand cleverly worked-out fugue (139, 167, 262, K.), until the influence\r\nof Archbishop Hieronymus led to the conclusion of the Credo, like the\r\nGloria, in a short animated chorus (257, 258, 259, 275, K.).\r\n\r\nVarious methods were employed to gather the phrases of the Creed into a\r\nconsistent musical work. The repetition of the word \"credo\" (167,\r\n257, K.), even in places where it somewhat disturbs the grammatical\r\nconstruction, serves to combine the musical texture of the movements\r\n\r\nThe periodical recurrence of the musical phrase conduces to careful\r\nmechanism, and gives opportunity for variety and increased intensity in\r\nthe treatment of the subject. Apart from this, unity is provided for\r\nby a pregnant rhythmical passage or a carefully finished subject which\r\nmarks the beginning of the Credo, and underlies its several divisions,\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(250)\r\n\r\nforming a sort of background from which the more impressive images stand\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate elaboration of this subject is the special task of the\r\nartist, and the text is to be considered only as a _point de départ_\r\nto it. The mode of treatment varies and is sometimes contrapuntal,\r\nsometimes harmonic; in one part the voices predominate, in another the\r\ninstruments, in which latter case the then favourite running passage for\r\nthe violins is frequently employed.\r\n\r\nThe general character of church music was more prominently displayed\r\nin the Creed than elsewhere. An animated and elevated frame of mind was\r\nvividly portrayed, with more cheerfulness and brilliancy than solemnity\r\nor earnest devotion, and only at moments does the music show a\r\nconsciousness of the deep significance of the text. Mozart pays tribute\r\nto his time; but his artistic nature did not allow him to sink into\r\ntriviality or commonplace; symmetry, beauty, and delicacy are never\r\nfound wanting. The remaining sections of the mass lend themselves more\r\nreadily to musical treatment. They express deep and universal sentiments\r\nin words as simple as those of the Kyrie, and musical both in sound and\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nThe Sanctus falls naturally into three well-defined parts. The first\r\nwords, \"Sanctus, Dominus Deus Sabaoth!\" intended to convey an impression\r\nof the most exalted sublimity, are generally treated as a solemn\r\nintroduction to the more animated and fervent words, \"Pleni sunt coli et\r\nterra gloria Tua.\" Agitation rises into joyful emotion in the Osanna, to\r\nwhich the form of a short fugal movement is usually given.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictus,[22] on the other hand, strives to express the secret\r\nthanksgiving of the heart at the coming of the Lord. A mild fervour\r\npenetrates the simple words, which seem to cast illumining beams on\r\nevery side. Mozart's artistic originality has so clearly stamped the\r\nimpress of his genius on the traditional form of the Benedictus that\r\nhis interpretation of it has become the customary one. It is, as a rule,\r\ngiven\r\n\r\n{BENEDICTUS.}\r\n\r\n(251)\r\n\r\nto solo voices, to which more prominence is given here than elsewhere.\r\nNow and then single voices (65,139,194, K.), but more often all\r\nthe four--now alternately, now in unison--announce the message of\r\nconsolation; obbligato organ accompaniments serve still further to mark\r\nthe prominence given to this movement (259 K.). It has a charming\r\neffect (258 K.) when the chorus recurring at intervals during the solos\r\nenunciates with sustained expression the word \"benedictus.\" The Osanna\r\nis usually repeated either entire or abridged from the Sanctus, but it\r\nis sometimes interwoven into the Benedictus (139, 262, K.)\r\n\r\nThe last movement falls naturally into two strongly contrasting\r\nsections. The first, expressing the sentiments of contrition, of\r\nanguished appeal for mercy, was treated with great partiality. The cry,\r\n\"Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi,\" and the prayer, \"miserere nobis,\"\r\nfurnish a natural grouping not seldom employed for alternations of solo\r\nand chorus; the mood expressed is very favourable to musical treatment.\r\n\r\nThe \"Dona nobis pacem\" is in complete contrast, and in no movement of\r\nthe mass is the alteration in the spirit of church music more apparent.\r\nThe peace which is prayed for is vividly represented, and just as vivid\r\nis the tone of cheerful confidence with which the prayer is offered.\r\nThe devout hearer was to be dismissed with a pleasant impression on his\r\nmind, and therefore the deep earnestness of this petition for peace was\r\nsacrificed in order to produce a feeling of self-satisfied enjoyment.\r\nThe music of the Dona maintains throughout this cheerful tone, and\r\nthough Mozart's variety and grace are as marked and effective here as\r\nelsewhere, even with him earnestness and depth are rarely to be met\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nWe may now conclude this general description with a glance in detail\r\non Mozart's masses. We have already spoken of his first attempts. Some\r\nunfinished masses, presumably the result of his studies under Padre\r\nMartini, exist, bearing date 1771 and 1772. The furthest advanced, in\r\nC major (115 K.), breaks off at the ninth bar of the Sanctus. It is\r\naccompanied only by a figured organ bass,\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(252)\r\n\r\nand is strictly treated with the exception of the two fugues; it is\r\nworked out in severe contrapuntal form almost throughout, as the Kyrie,\r\nintroduced by five bars of Adagio, will serve to show:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{MASS IN C MAJOR, 1772.}\r\n\r\n(253)\r\n\r\nThe whole work reminds us forcibly of Padre Martini's church\r\ncompositions, and it is not surprising that the hand of a learner should\r\nbe here apparent. A Mass in F major (116 K.), which breaks off at the\r\nwords \"sedet ad dexteram patris,\" is of the same kind, as well as a\r\nKyrie in C major (221 K.). An Osanna in C major (223 K.) and a Credo\r\n(\"in remissionem\" to \"mortuorum\") belonging to it seem also to have been\r\nstudies in counterpoint.\r\n\r\nA Mass in C major (139 K.), probably belonging to the year 1772, is an\r\neffort in quite another direction. Every means is employed to produce\r\nan extraordinary effect, and it may be conjectured that this, like the\r\nPater Dominicus mass, was composed for some special occasion.[23] Every\r\nsection is treated as a detached independent movement.\r\n\r\nThe Kyrie begins with a slow pathetic passage in C minor, followed by\r\nan animated allegro in C major 3-4, and by the Christe eleison as a solo\r\nquartet, after which the Kyrie is repeated.[24] The solo voices are much\r\nused in different combinations, apart from the short passages inserted\r\nbetween the choruses. Laudamus is a duet for soprano and alto, Domine\r\na duet for tenor and bass, Quoniam a soprano solo, Et incarnatus a duet\r\nfor soprano and alto, Et in spiritum a tenor solo, and Benedictus a\r\nsoprano solo, to which the chorus sings Osanna. Even the Agnus Dei\r\nbegins with a tenor solo followed by a chorus; the last appeal before\r\nthe Dona is given to the solo quartet. These solo movements are well\r\nrounded, and are both preceded and followed by long symphonies; the\r\neffort to produce a pleasing effect is apparent in the whole work, and\r\na moderate amount of operatic bravura is not disdained. This brings into\r\nstronger relief the pathos which is given to every passage capable of\r\nit. The Qui tollis, Crucifixus, and Agnus, as well as the Kyrie, are in\r\nthe\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(254)\r\n\r\nminor key; striking harmonies are emphasised by means of the\r\naccompaniment, and three trumpets contribute to the orchestral effects.\r\nThe solemn Crucifixus--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{MASS SS. TRINITATIS, 1773.}\r\n\r\n(255)\r\n\r\nfollows in evident contrast immediately upon the soprano solo--[See Page\r\nImage] whereupon the chorus and orchestra, with three trumpets, fall in.\r\n\r\nBut the youthful master does not neglect the display of his skill in\r\ncounterpoint. Besides some few instances of more or less elaborate\r\nimitation, the two customary fugues, the first on the theme--[See Page\r\nImage] the second \"et vitam\" are furnished with two subjects and every\r\nrequisite for complete fugues. It is true that the strongly contrasting\r\noriginal ideas exist only as such, and form no united whole, so that\r\nwe are all the more struck by the conventional treatment of the greater\r\npart of the work; but it must be conceded, notwithstanding, that\r\nprogress has been made, and that the power is making itself felt which,\r\nwith a wider field, shall produce better and more original work.\r\n\r\nThe mass composed in 1773 \"In honorem SS. Trinitatis\" (167 K.) is for\r\nchorus alone, without any solo movements: it displays no very high aim,\r\nbut earnestness and ability throughout. The Kyrie is long and elaborate,\r\nwithout any sustained subject. In the Gloria the voices sustain\r\nthe harmony, accompanied by a lively violin passage. The Credo is\r\ninteresting through the persistent attempt to mould it into a firm\r\nmusical organism. Three motifs occur quite at the beginning,\r\napportioned in different combinations to the voices, viz., a rhythmical,\r\ncharacteristic passage--[See Page Image] a more melodious phrase--\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(256)\r\n\r\nand a running passage:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{MASS SS. TRINITATIS, 1773.}\r\n\r\n(257)\r\n\r\nThese three subjects form the essential substance of the Credo, the\r\nfirst, with changing harmonies, forming the root whence the others\r\nspring at fitting places, by which means the due expression of the words\r\nand the musical exigences of the composition are alike provided for. The\r\ncontinuous agitation is only once interrupted, at the short but grave\r\nand dignified \"Et incarnatus est,\" and at the words \"Et in Spiritum\r\nSanctum.\" These points are emphasised by their separation from the rest\r\nthrough a long symphony, and by a digressive mode of treatment which\r\nreminds one of a solo. Towards the end of the broadly elaborated fugue,\r\n\"Et vitam,\" the violins return to the first motif of the Credo, the\r\nvoices take up the second motif with the \"Amen,\" and the violins,\r\nasserting the supremacy of the first, bring the whole to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictus is unusually grave for a chorus, but is relieved by\r\nthe easy grace of the violins. The thematic treatment of the principal\r\nsubject of the Dona--[See Page Image] gives it firmness and consistency;\r\nthe accompaniment becomes more prominent in the middle, and the\r\nadmirably well-sustained conclusion is dignified in mood and expression.\r\n\r\nThe Mass in F major (192 K.), composed on June 24,1774, is the work of a\r\nfinished artist, and has rightly been placed\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(258)\r\n\r\nnext after the Requiem.[25] The whole mass, which reminds us of the\r\nfinest examples of the older Neapolitan school, is in the strictest\r\nform of composition, none of the smaller sections forming an independent\r\nmovement; the most delicate use is made of the simplest materials. The\r\nchorus and solos alternate throughout, the solo voices (never concerted)\r\nsupplying the finer shadows to the chorus, which in return serves for\r\nresponse or repetition and conclusion. The accompaniment consists\r\nonly of a bass (figured for the organ) and two violins, but it is\r\nindependently worked out and effective both in tone-colouring and as a\r\ncontrast to the voices.\r\n\r\nEvery section of the mass is in counterpoint, and shows the firm hand of\r\na master. The unity of the whole and of the several parts, which is\r\nthe necessary consequence of this musical method, is apparent here to\r\na surprising degree. The parts combine to express and dilate upon\r\na well-defined idea, the separate features of which are not thrown\r\ntogether arbitrarily or by chance. A subject which in one place is\r\nmerely indicated or foreshadowed becomes in another the main subject; in\r\nshort, the independence of each separate part produces the uniform clear\r\ntexture of the whole. Thus the Gloria begins with an important subject\r\nfor the soprano--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{MASS IN P MAJOR, 1774.}\r\n\r\n(259)\r\n\r\nwhich is the groundwork of the whole movement, and--now entire and\r\nunaltered, now abridged or modified--appears in different positions as\r\nCantus firmus; while the remaining parts, treated contrapuntally, give\r\ndue emphasis to each change of mood, until the whole concludes with a\r\ngrand Amen in unison. The same thing occurs in the Credo. The link here\r\nis a motif--[See Page Image] which, borrowed from the intonation of the\r\nMagnificat or of the Gloria in the third tone, has been often employed,\r\nby Al. Scarlatti,[26] for instance, in a mass, and by Michael Haydn in a\r\ngradual (Qui sedes, No. 3), as Alleluia. Mozart has made frequent use\r\nof it. We find it again in the Sanctus of another mass (257 K.) in a\r\nSymphony in B flat major (319 K.) composed in 1779, in a pianoforte\r\nSonata in £ flat major, composed in 1785, each time easily treated as\r\na connecting subject, until it finally appears as the theme of the last\r\nmovement of the Symphony in C major (551 K.) In the present work it\r\nrecurs again and again as Cantus firmus, or in imitation, always the\r\nbond and support of the detached articles of faith. Then it becomes\r\nthe root of the subjects for single phrases, such as the magnificent\r\nCrucifixus, the Confiteor and the fugued Et vit am. We scarcely\r\nknow whether to admire most the masterly skill which makes light of\r\ndifficulty, or the inventive imagination which can develop an idea from\r\nso many and such varied-points of view, making the same subject express\r\ncalm faith in the Credo, bitter pain in the Crucifixus, and joyful\r\nconfidence in the Et vit am.\r\n\r\nThe Sanctus and Benedictus are short, fine contrapuntal movements, the\r\nBenedictus especially simple and full of grace. The Agnus Dei is freer\r\nin form. Three solo voices make the appeal, which the chorus answers\r\nwith \"miserere nobis.\" The harmonic successions, and the beautiful\r\nviolin passage in the accompaniment, give a peculiarly affecting\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(260)\r\n\r\ncharacter to this movement, which suggests a comparison with the\r\nRequiem. The Dona is fine and pure, but the effort to give it a cheerful\r\nand agreeable tone has robbed it of depth and significance.\r\n\r\nEven the accompaniment of this mass has an importance of its own, and\r\nthere is more art and beauty contained in the two violin parts than in\r\nmany a fuller score. Not content with giving an independent course to\r\nthe voices, Mozart allows the accompaniment also to go its own\r\nway, usually with a subject proper to it, treated freely, often in\r\ncounterpoint, and always with visible partiality.\r\n\r\nInventive genius, technical scholarship, and deep, clear comprehension,\r\nare more evidently displayed by Mozart in this mass than ever before;\r\nthe subjects have an intensity, a charm of beauty which had scarcely\r\nyet been suggested. Here, for the first time, we become aware of\r\nthat wonderful beauty, Mozart's most special endowment, which we\r\nmay designate sweetness, if we mean by that the perfect harmony of\r\na naturally developed artistic organism. The maiden freshness of its\r\nmanifestation here only increases the charm, and points to future\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nThe Mass in D major (194 K.), composed on August 8, 1774, has been\r\nrightly placed next to the one we have been considering.[27] The whole\r\nplan, the strict form, the flowing treatment, contrapuntal throughout,\r\nthe mature beauty, offer many points of resemblance, but the effort\r\nafter gracefulness is more apparent in the later mass, and is achieved\r\nat the sacrifice of gravity and ideality. The Kyrie displays a very\r\nsimilar conception. With the opening words of the soprano--[See Page\r\nImage]\r\n\r\nthe foundation is laid on which the whole structure of the movement is\r\nbuilt. In part in imitative combinations, in part extended into a longer\r\nsubject, and in part connected with opposing subjects for the voices and\r\nthe violins, this\r\n\r\n{MASS IN D. MAJOR, 1774.}\r\n\r\n(261)\r\n\r\nshort theme is elaborated into a fine long movement, as interesting as\r\nit is expressive. The Gloria and the Credo do not reach the same height;\r\nthe contrapuntal elaboration is only apparent in isolated passages, the\r\nsolos are expressive, but over-graceful, the music proceeds in a fine\r\nflow, and delights the listener, but only now and then stirs deeper\r\nfeelings. On the other hand, the Sanctus, Benedictus (a solo quartet),\r\nAgnus (alternate solo and chorus), are highly finished and tersely\r\ncomposed movements, in which beauty of form and sentiment combine.\r\nThe somewhat lengthy Dona preserves its pleasing character, without\r\ndegenerating into trifling. The effort to please by mere gracefulness is\r\nmost predominant in the Mass in B flat major (275 K.), the date of which\r\nis not known. The commencement with a soprano solo[28]--[See Page Image]\r\nis characteristic of the whole mass. The solo element pre-dominates,\r\nand a wealth of lovely, seductive, and expressive melodies is scattered\r\naround; but neither the conception nor the execution takes a deep hold\r\non the mind. The chorus is generally full, one might almost say merry;\r\nwhere harmonic or contrapuntal treatment comes to the front, it is\r\nexecuted with masterly ease; and such passages stand out in all the\r\nclearer relief against their surroundings. The principal passage of the\r\nCredo is striking:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(262)\r\n\r\nAccording to Lorentz it is a reminiscence--perhaps an accidental one--of\r\na favourite Volkslied, \"Bauer hang' den Pummerl an.\" The introduction of\r\nthe following theme--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{LATER MASSES, 1775-77.}\r\n\r\n(263)\r\n\r\nafter a highly original and striking harmonic progression, cannot\r\nfail to injure the effect. The Sanctus is a short fugued movement,\r\nthe Benedictus an unusually melodious soprano solo with an original\r\naccompaniment; the Agnus goes deepest, and is serious in feeling as well\r\nas wonderfully sweet. Works like the Masses in F and D major prove what\r\nMozart was capable of in church music if his genius could have had free\r\nscope. But the \"rapid advance of ecclesiastical reformation in\r\nSalzburg under the wise and immortal prince, Archbishop Hieronymus\r\nvon Colloredo,\"[29] had its effect on the treatment of the mass. The\r\nlimitation of its duration and the abolition of solo singing proper and\r\nof fugues might appear to be the result of ecclesiastical rigour. But\r\nHieronymus was far more inclined to favour secular taste in church\r\nmusic; and he was fond besides of displaying a royal magnificence and\r\nsplendour. This external influence is apparent in the conception and\r\ntreatment of the later masses composed after 1775, more particularly\r\nin one belonging to 1776 (262 K.), with a Kyrie in counterpoint and two\r\nelaborate fugues. Especially earnest and beautiful, both as to technical\r\nworkmanship and expression, are the movements on which the musical\r\ntreatment was becoming more and more concentrated, the Qui tollis (of\r\nwhich the accompaniment recalls the fugue, Quam olim Abrahæ in the\r\nRequiem), the Et incarnatus est, and Agnus Dei. Even the Benedictus\r\n(where the chorus answers the \"Benedictus\" of the solos by \"Osanna\")\r\nand the Dona are sustained in style. How fundamentally this mass differs\r\nfrom that in F major is clearly shown by the ground-tones of the\r\nGloria and the Credo, which are animated and brilliant, but without any\r\nintensity or depth of meaning. The same tendency is still more marked in\r\nthe remaining masses (220, 257, 258, 259, K.).[30] Increasing maturity\r\nis manifest in the\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(264)\r\n\r\nfirm and skilful handling of all available means, and the subjects\r\ndisplay uncommon fertility of invention. But real creative inspiration\r\nis crushed by the obligation to compose after a set fashion.\r\n\r\nWe do not need to look further than such church music to become aware\r\nthat the Archbishop loved to bring the pomp and glitter of his royal\r\nstation into the services of the church. Such a task obliges the artist\r\nto use his art more and more consciously as a means to an end. The\r\ninevitable result is inequality and exaggeration, his genius and his\r\nwork being often at variance; the charm of mere grace leads to the\r\ndanger of softness and effeminacy, and fluent animation becomes\r\nmeaningless superficiality. The effort to be light and pleasing is\r\nmanifest in these masses by their superfluity of detail. We find an\r\nover-abundance of beautiful melodies and harmonies, combined with\r\ngreat freedom in the treatment both of voices and orchestra, and in the\r\nworking-out of the subjects.\r\n\r\nThere are isolated instances of deeper sentiment and more poetic\r\nconception which are heightened in effect by the earnest technical\r\nskill displayed in their working-out, and which give glimpses of happy\r\ninspiration, not belonging of necessity to the fundamental conception of\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nUnhappily it is on these masses, in the composition of which Mozart's\r\ngenius could only move within very confined limits, that his fame as a\r\ncomposer of church music chiefly rests; and musicians who have taken\r\nhim as their model have striven most to imitate these, his least\r\nsatisfactory works.\r\n\r\nThe great resemblance in plan and mechanism of the masses of\r\ncontemporary composers, such as Hasse, Nau-mann, Joseph and Michael\r\nHaydn, proves a strict adherence to the rules of composition then in\r\nforce. A consideration of their works serves to heighten the effect of\r\nMozart's higher and nobler conceptions, of his poetical sentiment, and\r\nof that sense of proportion which regards a work of art as a whole,\r\nand recognises the limits imposed on it from without as the necessary\r\nconditions of artistic production. Many excellent qualities may be\r\nconceded to these musicians, but none of them attained to the harmonious\r\nbeauty of Mozart.\r\n\r\n{CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(265)\r\n\r\nThe artists of a later age, who imitated and exaggerated the cramped and\r\nobsolete forms, which had been the result of many circumstances, as\r\nif they were in themselves an all-sufficient musical method, judged\r\nMozart's works by their own standard, and found them in many respects\r\nunsatisfactory.[31]\r\n\r\nBefore condemning Mozart's readiness to adapt his compositions to\r\nexternal conditions, we must consider the mode of thought of the time.\r\nAll art, more especially music, stood in the closest connection with\r\nthe ordinary affairs of life; operas, masses, instrumental works\r\nwere composed when, where, and how they were required, for particular\r\noccasions, and particular performers. Occasions of the kind were eagerly\r\nsought for, and furnished an impulse and incitement to the composer,\r\neven when they somewhat hampered his productive powers. Exaggerated as\r\nthe reference to external circumstances and mechanical resources became,\r\nit formed the groundwork, rightly understood, of thorough artistic\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThe demand for church music was one that came with peculiar authority\r\nat Salzburg, since the priest who commanded it was considered as the\r\nmouthpiece of the Church; he also stood in the place of the sovereign,\r\narranging the performances and paying for them: respect for his position\r\nwas both natural and proper. Mozart was by nature easily led, so long as\r\nhis deeper feelings of antagonism were not stirred; then he was firm and\r\ndecided. Trained under the discipline of his father to fulfil every\r\nduty conscientiously, and to turn to the best account whatever was\r\ninevitable, he endeavoured, as long as circumstances made it advisable,\r\nto satisfy the demands of the archbishop, and to make them conducive to\r\nhis own improvement.\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC}.\r\n\r\n(266)\r\n\r\nIn this he was guided by a nature so completely that of an artist as not\r\nto feel cramped or bound even by real restrictions. Composition was a\r\njoy and necessity to him, and a trifling impulse only was needed to\r\nset his poetical activity in motion; this once accomplished, external\r\nconditions served him for tools, and their just and appropriate use soon\r\nbecame second nature to him.\r\n\r\nThe statement often made, and for the most part with a very imperfect\r\nknowledge of the subject, that Mozart's masses are his weakest\r\nworks,[32] cannot be accepted without large reservations; and we have it\r\nin our power to give a decided contradiction to Thibaut's assertion[33]\r\nthat \"Mozart thought little of his masses, and often when a mass was\r\nordered, he objected that he was only made for opera. But he was offered\r\none hundred louis d'or for every mass, and that he could not refuse;\r\nonly he used to say, laughing, that he would take whatever was good in\r\nhis masses and use it in his next opera.\"\r\n\r\nThe apparent particularity of this story is pure invention, employed, as\r\nso often happens, to give a colour to mere conjecture; and the invention\r\nis clumsy. Mozart only wrote for the church in Salzburg; in Vienna he\r\ndid not compose a single mass to order, and only one, the unfinished one\r\nin C minor, on his own account. Such fees as that above mentioned never\r\nput his constancy to the test; we know that he received one hundred\r\nducats for an opera. Again, thoughtlessness in the composition of church\r\nmusic is imputed to Mozart. He had strongly biassed opinions, but\r\nthey were honest convictions; and his church work was always thoroughly\r\nearnest. Rochlitz tells us that at Leipzig,\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S VIEWS ON CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(267)\r\n\r\nin conversation on church music, Mozart declared that a Protestant could\r\nnot possibly conceive the associations which the services of the Church\r\nawoke in the mind of a devout Catholic, nor the powerful effect which\r\nthey had on the genius of an artist.[34]\r\n\r\nMozart's education was calculated to make him a good Catholic; a\r\nconscientious observance of all that the Church prescribes and reverence\r\nfor her usages were combined in him with a clear and penetrating\r\nintellect.[35] After his betrothal he wrote to his father (August 17,\r\n1782), that he had heard mass and been to confession with his Constanze:\r\n\"It seems to me that I have never prayed so earnestly, or confessed\r\nand communicated so devoutly as by her side--and it is the same with\r\nher.\"[36]\r\n\r\nI find no trace whatever of Mozart's having looked with disdain upon\r\nchurch music. His way of expressing himself to Padre Martini directly\r\ndisproves the assertion; he took his church music with him on his\r\njourneys, expecting to gain credit by it; and sent for some of it from\r\nVienna that it might be heard by Van Swieten, a severe critic.\r\n\r\nSo far from giving himself out as a mere operatic composer, who has a\r\nmean opinion of church compositions, he recommends himself for the post\r\nof under-kapellmeister, by saying, \"The learned kapellmeister Salieri\r\nhas never devoted himself to church music, while I have made it my\r\npeculiar study from my youth up.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an unjust reproach also that Mozart robbed his masses for his\r\noperas. Among his numerous compositions of both kinds, a single Agnus\r\nDei (317 K.)--a soprano solo--contains in its opening bars a slight\r\nsuggestion of the aria \"Dove sono,\" from \"Figaro.\"\r\n\r\nNext in importance to masses must be reckoned litanies and vespers; and\r\nhere we find the influence of the opera much more decided. The words\r\ndid not readily lend themselves to musical expression, nor to the\r\narrangement of\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(268)\r\n\r\nthe movements. If the severity of ecclesiastical form was once relaxed,\r\nthe easier and more pleasing forms were most likely to be employed in\r\nthose places where the words were most opposed to musical expression.\r\nThe dissimilarity of the different parts was increased by the supposed\r\nnecessity of also representing the severe style, and of balancing a\r\n_tour de force_ of counterpoint by a _tour de force_ of execution. In\r\nthis way certain conventional rules had become law, leaving little scope\r\nfor variety or originality.\r\n\r\nCommon to all litanies are the Kyrie with which they begin, and the\r\nAgnus Dei with which they close; that which lies between (the petitions\r\nvarying according to the circumstances under which the litany was\r\ncomposed) determines its musical character. In the Kyrie, other\r\npetitions are added to the \"Kyrie eleison\" and \"Christe eleison,\" which\r\ngive scope for a broader and more varied treatment, whereby the Kyrie\r\nbecomes one of the most important and impressive movements. The Agnus\r\nDei does not close with \"Dona nobis pacem,\" but with \"Miserere nobis,\"\r\nwhich prevents any suggestion of cheerfulness; the expression of anxious\r\nbeseeching was generally softened into deep solemnity at the close.\r\n\r\nThe invocations which form the substance of litanies are too numerous,\r\ndisconnected, and wanting in climax to be well adapted for composition;\r\nand most of the petitions recited by the priest are equally incapable of\r\ndefinite musical expression. The musical setting of the service, to\r\nbe appropriate, must be strictly liturgical, and the recurring refrain\r\nstamps it with a typical formulistic character. Should this tradition\r\nonce be forsaken, its place must be taken by a setting full of lights\r\nand shades, often heterogeneous in treatment, and accentuated in\r\naccordance with form rather than reason. The distinguishing refrain\r\ncould only be used to link together conflicting elements, or else as a\r\nvehicle for shades of sentiment, and a variety of expression would be\r\ngiven to the simple petitions, \"Ora pro nobis,\" \"Miserere nobis,\" which\r\nwould be quite foreign to their nature.\r\n\r\nThe Litanies to the Virgin (Litaniæ Lauretanæ) were, on the whole,\r\ncheerful and pleasing. When the devout\r\n\r\n{LITANY TO THE VIRGIN, 1771.}\r\n\r\n(269)\r\n\r\nworshipper turned to the Virgin Mother, the image that rose to his mind\r\nwas that of a pure and holy maiden, and the veneration for all that\r\nis womanly which her worship induced was apparent in the music as\r\nelsewhere. The tone of the litanies sung in Italy before the images of\r\nthe Virgin in the streets is echoed in the compositions of most of\r\nthe Italian musicians, and is perceptible in many parts of Mozart's\r\nlitanies.\r\n\r\nThe first Litany in B flat major (109 K.), composed in May, 1771,\r\nis precise in form, and firmly and ably treated, although in no very\r\nelevated strain. The Kyrie, as in short masses, is composed of a single\r\nanimated choral movement, without any definite development of the\r\nsubject. The first part of the litany proper is divided between the\r\nchorus and solo voices, the soprano being most prominent; the whole\r\nwork is interesting, melodious, simple in its harmonies, and singularly\r\npopular in tone. Upon the delivery of the solemn \"Salus infirmorum\"\r\nby the chorus follows a quick, vigorous choral passage to the words\r\n\"auxilium Christianorum.\" The solo voices raise the appeal \"Regina\r\nangelorum\" to the Queen of Heaven, who seems to shed the glory of her\r\nmanifestation upon the minds of her worshippers. In the last movement,\r\nthe chorus comes in with \"Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi,\" the\r\nsolo voices answer with the prayer, and the chorus winds up with the\r\n\"Miserere nobis.\" The tone is composed, more serious than melancholy,\r\nand rising in intensity towards the close. The actual mechanism is\r\nsimple; the voices are seldom in true counterpoint, the modulations are\r\nfreely and firmly handled: the accompaniment makes little attempt at\r\nindependent significance.\r\n\r\nFar more important is the second Litany in D major (195 K.), belonging\r\nto the year 1774, the same in which the Masses in F and D major and the\r\n\"Finta Giardiniera\" were written; the maturity of its conception and the\r\ncarefulness of its execution make it worthy to take a place beside these\r\nworks. The Kyrie is a grand, lovingly elaborated movement, a solemn\r\nAdagio, followed by a serious sustained Allegro. The parts are\r\nthroughout in strict counterpoint, principal and accessory subjects kept\r\nwell in hand\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(270)\r\n\r\nand carefully elaborated; the orchestra, too, is independently treated.\r\nThe expression is appropriate and dignified, and over the whole is\r\nspread a peaceful calm, bespeaking the nature of the music to which it\r\nforms the introductory movement.\r\n\r\nThe first section of the Litany proper gives us the impression of\r\na cheerful--one might almost say _sensuous_--spirit pervading each\r\npetition, but always with a tone of delicate moderation. The musical\r\nformation betrays the unmistakable influence of the opera, both in the\r\nsolo soprano passages and in the aria-like treatment of the principal\r\nsubject. Refrain is used with happy effect in the chorus, and the\r\naccompaniment is easy and flowing throughout. The whole movement is\r\nmelodious, and full of tender grace and harmony. In quite another\r\nstyle is the Adagio next following, where the words \"Salus infirmorum,\r\nrefugium peccatorum, consolatrix afflictorum, auxilium Christianum,\"\r\nare taken together. The construction of this movement, the arrangement\r\nand gradations of the details, the alternations of solo and chorus, the\r\ncharacteristically careful elaboration of the accompaniment, are all so\r\nadmirably calculated and balanced, and the whole movement is pervaded\r\nwith so much earnestness and depth of sentiment, that beauty and\r\ngrandeur seem here indeed to be wedded together. The following section,\r\n\"Regina ange-lorum,\" is again in a lighter vein; the choruses are fresh\r\nand animated, but the interpolated tenor solo is operatic in form and\r\nweak in invention and expression. The \"Agnus Dei\" is divided between a\r\nsolo soprano and the chorus; the former, though evidently composed for\r\nexecutive display, is not without feeling and dignity; the short choral\r\npassages are excellent, both in workmanship and expression.\r\n\r\nVery evident, also, is the loving care bestowed on the orchestral score;\r\nits main strength lies in the delicately elaborated string quartet, but\r\nthe wind instruments are also effectively made use of to produce lights\r\nand shadows. The mature and harmonious beauty of the numerous motifs and\r\ncharacteristic passages conveys the unmistakable impression of Mozart's\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nOf a third Litany for four voices without accompaniment,\r\n\r\n{LITANY TO THE HOLY SACRAMENT, 1772.}\r\n\r\n(271)\r\n\r\nthe opening bars of the Kyrie (340 K.) and Sancta Maria in C major (325\r\nK.), and of the Salus infirmorum in C minor (324 K.) are unhappily all\r\nthat is preserved.\r\n\r\nThe Litany to the Holy Sacrament, (Litaniæ de venerabili altaris\r\nsacramento), has a more serious character than the Litany to the Virgin.\r\nBut appeals to the holy sacrament being of necessity abstract and\r\ndogmatic, are less suggestive of a musical rendering than those\r\naddressed to the Virgin Mary. On this account an operatic style is\r\nmore avowedly employed; but it is combined with solemn dignity and\r\nthoughtfulness, and the two Litanies of this kind by Mozart are largely\r\nconceived and carefully executed compositions.[37]\r\n\r\nThe first in B flat major (125 K.), composed in March, 1772, after the\r\nItalian tour, strikes throughout the tone of the heroic opera, elevated\r\nby deep and earnest feeling. The Kyrie is introduced by an instrumental\r\npassage, announcing the principal subject, which, after a short, solemn\r\nAdagio, is taken up by the chorus in Allegro molto. The plan of the\r\nwhole movement, containing a second subject placed as contrast to the\r\noft-repeated principal one, and a running orchestral accompaniment,\r\nfollows the operatic mode of construction.\r\n\r\nThe first movement of the Litany proper, \"Panis vivus,\" is a soprano\r\nsolo which might have been transferred bodily from an opera seria; the\r\nchief passages are given to the word \"miserere.\" The solemn chorus\r\nwhich follows, \"Verbum caro factum,\" interesting from its delicate\r\nmodulations, and a characteristic passage for the violins, serves as an\r\nintroduction to the agitated \"Hostia sancta.\" Four solo voices give the\r\nchief motif in succession, with different modifications, and unite at\r\nlast to rise to an appropriate climax; the chorus twice interposes with\r\na short but weighty rhythmical passage,\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(272)\r\n\r\ngiving cohesion and dignity to the whole movement. A new climax occurs\r\nin the Adagio, where the chorus repeats the word \"Tremendum\" with an\r\nexpression of solemn awe. The short, lively passage given to the next\r\nwords, \"ac vivificum sacramentum,\" is only to serve as a contrast to the\r\n\"Tremendum.\" The movement which follows \"Panis omnipotentia verbi caro\r\nfactus,\" is again nothing but an operatic tenor song, full of passages\r\nand pleasing expression. The grave harmonies of a short Adagio in B\r\nminor, \"Viaticum in domino morientium,\" prepare the way for something\r\nnew.[38] It was the custom to write a movement in elaborate counterpoint\r\non the words of \"Pignus futuræ gloriæ,\" and Mozart was not one to shrink\r\nfrom such a task. The bass theme, answered by the wind instruments in\r\na passage afterwards much employed, is announced with the force and\r\ndecision of joyful confidence, and is then exhaustively worked out into\r\na long fugue.[39] The one theme, hardly ever abridged or altered, runs\r\nthrough the whole, but it is developed with an amount of variety,\r\nespecially in the modulation and in the orchestral climax, and with so\r\nmuch fresh tunefulness, that this work alone would prove the youth of\r\nfifteen years old to be possessed of the genius of maturity.\r\n\r\nThe Agnus Dei is a soprano solo, ornamented with many passages, all\r\nalike truly and simply conceived and full of grace.[40] The chorus takes\r\nup the Agnus Dei at the third repetition, and brings the movement to a\r\ncalm conclusion, making use of the solo motif altered and simplified.\r\nThe \"Finis, I.O.D.G.,\" inscribed by Mozart, contrary to his custom, at\r\nthe end of his score, show that he set considerable store by this truly\r\nadmirable work.\r\n\r\nThe second Litany in E flat major (243 K.), composed in\r\n\r\n{LITANY IN E FLAT MAJOR, 1776.}\r\n\r\n(273)\r\n\r\nMarch, 1776, also a carefully worked-out piece of music, displays the\r\nsame arrangement. The operatic treatment of some of the parts is more\r\nconspicuous, because its tinsel glitter is in more marked contrast to\r\nthe mature earnestness of the work as a whole. The Kyrie, expressive of\r\nmild calm, relieved by the agitation of the accompaniment, is simple\r\nin plan and execution. Solo and chorus alternate; the principal motif\r\nrecurs at the end, after a middle part of smaller motifs grouped\r\ntogether. The Miserere is delicately shaded and finely expressed.\r\nAfter such harmonious renderings of a calm and collected mood, we\r\nare surprised by the words \"Panis vivus\" as an elaborate tenor song,\r\naltogether in the style of opera seria. In the succeeding movements,\r\nwhere the text seldom lends itself readily to musical adaptation, the\r\nhand of the master is visible in the admirable grouping of the larger\r\nsections and of the separate subjects, not less than in the true and\r\nbeautiful expression of sentiment, and in the finely graduated and\r\nshaded unity of tone. The words \"Verbum caro factum\" are used as a\r\nsolemn introduction; the Miserere has-a fine effect, commencing without\r\nan accompaniment, as if moaned forth from an overburdened breast, then\r\nincreasing in intensity to a cry of anguish, and gradually sinking back\r\ninto itself. The next succeeding Hostia sancta stands out against this\r\ndark background, its general tone as mild and consolatory as that of the\r\nKyrie. Solemn grandeur predominates again in the Tremendum ac vivificum\r\nsacramentum, where the words \"Tremendum\" and \"vivificum\" are not\r\nseparated, but are compacted into a connected, symmetrical movement with\r\nthe words \"Panis omnipotentia verbi caro factus, incruentum sacrificium,\r\ncibus et conviva.\" The disposition of the harmonies is in strongly\r\nmarked but cleverly arranged opposition, intensified by the orchestra;\r\nthe stringed instruments elaborate a forcible passage, opposed by the\r\nunited oboes, horns, bassoons, and trombones. This noble and deeply\r\nimpressive movement stands alone, both as to form and intention. The\r\nnext following, \"Dulcissimum convivium,\" a soprano solo resembling a\r\ncavatina, is soft and tender in expression, and pre-eminently operatic;\r\nthe charm\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(274)\r\n\r\nof style, displayed also in the careful accompaniment, does not\r\ncompensate for fundamental weakness.\r\n\r\nThe \"Viaticum in Domino morientium\" is full of earnestness, and very\r\noriginal in treatment. The soprano voices give out as subject the\r\nchorale of the hymn to the Holy Sacrament, \"Pange lingua gloriosi,\" as\r\na Gregorian plain-chant, accompanied by the wind instruments (oboes,\r\nhorns, bassoons, and trombones), and two muted violas, while the violins\r\nare occupied with a quaver passage in _pizzicato_, generally in divided\r\nchords. The effect of the whole is surprisingly serious and dignified.\r\nThe Pignus futuræ gloriæ follows. It is in counterpoint, and of\r\ncomplicated workmanship. The chief subject of six bars comprises the\r\nwords \"Pignus futuræ gloriæ, miserere nobis,\" but in the third bar, at\r\nthe words \"miserere nobis,\" the three remaining parts are added--[See\r\nPage Image]\r\n\r\nand the subject given to them is differently elaborated along with the\r\ncontinuation of the chief theme. After the first working-out a second\r\nindependent theme occurs--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{UNFINISHED VESPER, 1774.}\r\n\r\n(275)\r\n\r\nand is thoroughly worked out, together with the first. We see more\r\nof the actual workmanship in this than in others of Mozart's works\r\nin counterpoint, and the voices are treated less as such and more as\r\nabstract vehicles for contrapuntal development. The Agnus Dei is a\r\nsoprano solo; the passages for the voices, and the concerted treatment\r\nof the accompanying instruments, give a uniform impression of grace and\r\nelegance. This movement has a certain resemblance to many passages of\r\nMozart's later operas. At the close the chorus (as sometimes with Haydn)\r\ntakes up again the principal subject of the Kyrie, and works it into a\r\nsimple and appropriate ending to the Litany.\r\n\r\nMozart seems never to have composed an entire Vesper during this period,\r\nbut the two final movements of one, Dixit and Magnificat in C major\r\n(193 K.), written in July, 1774, are preserved, and are serious works\r\nin clever counterpoint. The Dixit is quite in the style of a short mass,\r\nthe different sections in counterpoint full of force and animation. The\r\nGloria Patri is an independent movement, with a slow introduction to\r\na short fugal movement on the words \"et in sæcula saeculorum,\" with a\r\ncharming organ point. [See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThe Magnificat is grander in design and execution. The Virgin's song\r\nof praise forms a grand movement (Allegro moderato), the theme of which\r\nfrom the third plain-song tone of the Magnificat--\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(276)\r\n\r\nis introduced by the tenor, the bass immediately interposing a\r\ncounter-subject:--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nThese give the groundwork of the whole movement, elaborated in various\r\nforms of counterpoint, and bound together by other freely treated\r\nepisodical subjects. The Doxology is again independently treated in two\r\nmovements. The first is slow, and is animated by a varied accompaniment;\r\nthe second is a lively and conventional fugue.\r\n\r\nFirst among minor church pieces we may consider the \"Regina coeli.\" Two\r\nof these works, belonging to May, 1771 and 1772 (108, 127, K.), are\r\nof similar plan and treatment. The first line is made into an animated\r\nchorus, with the constantly recurring Alleluia as a refrain; the second\r\nis more moderate in tone, a soprano solo alternating with the chorus.\r\nThe \"Ora pro nobis\" is an Adagio for the solo soprano; the chorus chimes\r\nin at the close with the Alleluia. The character of the whole is lively\r\nand cheerful, almost merry, according to the prevailing tendency of the\r\nage. Full opportunities for display are given to the solo voice, and\r\nmany of the turns and passages are operatic.[41] The earlier of the two\r\ncompositions, in C major, reminds us more of opera seria; the later,\r\nin B flat major, is freer, and both voices and accompaniment have more\r\nindependent life. A third Regina coeli, evidently of later date (276\r\nK.), in C major, combines the whole into a lively movement, in which the\r\nsolo voices interrupt the chorus. The claims of the vocalist are here\r\nkept in abeyance, and the work is full of life and energy, with here and\r\nthere passages of a deeper significance, such as the beautiful \"Ora pro\r\nnobis.\"[42]\r\n\r\n{SMALLER SACRED PIECES.}\r\n\r\n(277)\r\n\r\nA \"Tantum ergo\" in B flat major (142 K.), for soprano solo, with a\r\nresponding phrase for the chorus, closing with a lively Amen, is not\r\nremarkable. A second composition, in D major, (197 K.) for full chorus,\r\nif by Mozart at all, must have been written very hurriedly.\r\n\r\nA Motett in C major (117 K.) must, according to the handwriting, be\r\nascribed to a very early date.[43] A lively chorus Benedictus sit Deus,\r\nwithout actual thematic elaboration but with a free arrangement of the\r\nparts, forms the introduction to a soprano air, Introibo domum tuam\r\ndomine treated like a cavatina, simply, although not altogether with\r\nout embellishment. The conclusion is formed by a second lively chorus,\r\nJubilate Deo, of which the second subject is the eighth psalm tone--[See\r\nPage Image] supported by the four parts of the chorus in succession, to\r\na florid accompaniment of the orchestra, the full chorus each time\r\nresponding with a lively \"Jubilate.\" [44]\r\n\r\nAn Offertorium of uncertain date, \"Benedicite angeli\" (342 K.), is\r\nexclusively founded on the fifth psalm tone. The verse--[See Page\r\nImage] is repeated in unison eight times by the whole chorus, while the\r\norchestra, consisting of stringed instruments with two\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(278)\r\n\r\nhorns, keeps the whole together, and gives it intensified expression by\r\nmeans of a lively and varied accompaniment.\r\n\r\nSome smaller choral works are some of them harmonic, some in more or\r\nless strict counterpoint. To the former belongs the \"De profundis\" (93\r\nK.), in which the words of Psalm cxxix. and the appended doxology are\r\nset to music without abridgment, with little more rhythmical flow than\r\nthe declamation of the words demands, and in the simplest harmonic\r\nprogressions. A symmetrical work, quiet and serious, though without\r\ngreat depth of tone, is formed out of these very simple materials.\r\n\r\nThe \"Te Deum\" (141 K.) resembles in its first movements many of the\r\nshorter masses; the words are sung once, without a developed theme\r\nor well-defined passages. The essential character of the work is\r\nmodulatory, the connection depending on the arrangement of the harmonies\r\nand the harmonic groups; the voices merely sustain the harmonies,\r\nwithout any prominent melodic peculiarities. The conclusion forms an\r\nexception, the words, \"In Te Domine speravi, non confundar in ætemum\"\r\nbeing worked into a conventional, moderately long fugue, issuing into a\r\npowerful and effective closing phrase.\r\n\r\nA motett, \"Misericordias Domini\" (222 K.), which Mozart composed at\r\nMunich in 1775 as an exercise, is in counterpoint throughout. Padre\r\nMartini, to whom he sent it (September, 1776), pronounced, as his\r\njudgment on it, that it contained all which modern music demands--good\r\nharmonies, rich modulations, moderation in the violin passages,\r\na natural and good arrangement of the parts--and he added that he\r\ncongratulated the composer on the progress he had made. It was not\r\nwithout intention that the representative of counterpoint on the\r\nprinciples of the old Roman school emphasised modern music, the \"buon\r\ngusto\" of which did not altogether content him.[45]\r\n\r\nMozart divided the sentence \"Misericordias Domini cantabo in æternum\"\r\n(Psalm lxxxviii.). The first words,\r\n\r\n{MISERICORDIAS, 1775.}\r\n\r\n(279)\r\n\r\n\"Misericordias Domini,\" are delivered in slow notes, the second half in\r\nan agitated fugal passage, without change of tempo (moderato). The two\r\nalternate, and are developed with much originality, especially the\r\nfirst movement, where long-sustained notes for the voices serve as an\r\norgan-point against a passage for the violins, and give rise to striking\r\nharmonic transitions and progressions. The counterpoint of the second\r\npart is artistic and elaborate; besides the principal subject of\r\nthe fugue there are two others leading out of it, treated in part\r\nindependently, in part in combination with the principal subject and\r\neach other; the episodes are in strict counterpoint. The subject,\r\nas Stadler remarked,[46] is borrowed from an offertory by Eberlin,\r\n\"Benedixisti Domine\"; but Mozart's treatment, as a glance at the\r\nopening will show, is thoroughly original.[47] This admirable work\r\nhas been overrated by Ulibicheff,[48] but very unfairly criticised by\r\nThibaut.[49] He says:--\r\n\r\nThe words are capable of division into two short sections: Misericordias\r\nDomini (the mercy of the Lord), cantabo in æternum (I will sing for\r\never), but the division is not a real one. For there can be only one\r\nfundamental idea--either \"Misericordias Domini\" or \"cantabo in æternum.\"\r\nIf the former, then the \"cantabo\" should be subordinate; if the latter,\r\nthe \"Misercordias\" must be included in the exultation. Mozart has so far\r\ngiven way to the love of the picturesque, to which Handel also made\r\nmany sacrifices, that the \"Misericordias\" is to be sung softly, but the\r\n\"cantabe in æternum\" energetically and in a lively fugued passage. When\r\nthe last motif has been worked out, the Grave is repeated, and then\r\nagain the fugue.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the law by which thoughts are expressed in _speech_\r\ndoes not altogether apply to _musical_ expression, but that with the\r\nintroduction of a new element new rules are\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(280)\r\n\r\nimposed. Since the words, intelligently interpreted, give the keynote to\r\nthe whole conception, it is the musician's task to embody the sentiments\r\ninspired by them in such forms as he has at his disposal. The necessity\r\nfor avoiding contradictions or inconsistencies is no barrier, but rather\r\nan incentive to his creative energy. But a contradiction may arise not\r\nonly from a misconception of ideas, but from the undue prominence of\r\nsome one point which, detached from the context, injures the effect\r\nof the whole. This would be the case here, if, as Thibaut seems to\r\nindicate, the idea of the mercy of God, and that of the praise offered\r\nto it, were treated in absolute opposition and mechanical alternation\r\none with the other. But this is not so. The motifs given to the words\r\n\"cantabo in ætemum,\" both in themselves and in their working-out,\r\nexpress nothing but firm conviction and desire to act upon that\r\nconviction; we seem to view the spiritual condition of a human being\r\nwho, in spite of adverse fate and sorrowful experiences, is never weary\r\nof praising the Lord. The \"cantabo\" is placed just as Thibaut demands\r\nthat it should be, as a contrast to the \"Misercordias Domini and the\r\ncontrast is so harmoniously expressed and so consistently sustained as\r\nin no way to injure the musical effect of the work as a whole.[50]\r\n\r\nA very interesting composition, belonging to the year 1776, is the\r\nOffertorium de Venerabili (260 K.), \"Venite populi,\" for two choruses,\r\nscored in eight parts.[51] It is imitative throughout, less strict in\r\nform than usual; the voices seem to take actual delight in their free\r\nmovement; the two choruses and the separate parts are clearly divided\r\nwhile maintaining natural relations with each other, and the whole work\r\nis sharply cut and characteristic both in harmonies and in rhythm. The\r\nprincipal movement is divided in the middle by a short, slow movement,\r\nhaving the same motif, but in different combinations.\r\n\r\n{VOICES AND ORCHESTRA.}\r\n\r\n(281)\r\n\r\nA \"Sancta Maria, mater Dei\" (273 K.), for chorus, composed in September,\r\n1777, and an \"Alma redemptoris mater\" (277 K.), for solo and chorus,\r\nof about the same date, judging by the style, are very differently\r\nconceived: they are simple in design and in treatment, quiet and mild\r\nin expression. Delicate lights and shades betray the hand of a master\r\nconscious of his power to stir the feelings and satisfy the sense of\r\nbeauty of his hearers. Equal genius is displayed in the selection of\r\nsimple meins, and the ease with which the right effect is given at the\r\nright moment; and every now and then a delicate harmonic inflection, or\r\na charming little motif in the accompaniment, leaves us in no doubt as\r\nto Mozart's individuality.[52]\r\n\r\nThe survey we have taken of Mozart's church music will give some idea\r\nof the industry with which he strove to master the various forms of his\r\nart, as well as of the ease and fertility of his production, and the\r\ntruth of his artistic feeling. Remembering his activity in operatic\r\nmusic, we are amazed at the wealth of his many-sided genius; but the\r\nunceasing exercise of all his musical powers serves to explain in part\r\nthat marvellous acquaintance with all the technicalities and forms of\r\nhis art which not even the possession of great genius can account for in\r\nso youthful a composer.\r\n\r\nExternal circumstances influenced not only the conception and treatment\r\nof church music, but the means at disposal for its performance. Mozart's\r\nchief dependence in Salzburg was on the chorus, as is shown in a\r\nletter (November 4, 1777), where he says that none of his masses can\r\nbe performed at Mannheim, because the chorus was bad, and the orchestra\r\nmust be the first consideration. This is confirmed by the works\r\nthemselves, of which the choruses are always the main substance; Mozart\r\nfound his materials ready to hand in the carefully instructed church\r\nsingers and chapel choir. He had himself received vocal training. Even\r\nas a boy the correct delivery and good management of his voice excited\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(282)\r\n\r\nastonishment; and though he lost his voice on attaining manhood, his\r\nintercourse with trained singers gave him an accurate knowledge of\r\nthe voice and its treatment. Careful as Mozart is to arrange each part\r\neasily and conveniently for performance, yet he always reckons\r\non well-trained singers, and even exacts from the choristers, where\r\noccasion requires, not a little skill in taking intervals and in\r\nexecution and intonation. Above all, he demands the intelligent delivery\r\nof a singer who knows how much depends upon it.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the solo voices as regards execution does not differ\r\nin church and operatic music. Frau Haydn and Meissner, Marie Anna\r\nBraunhofer and Jos. Spitzeder, had received good practical training,\r\nbut they were not such remarkable performers as to call forth new or\r\noriginal creations. When the solo voices are not treated with a view to\r\nexecutive display they are altogether in the style of chorus parts.\r\n\r\nThe organ, as the instrument appropriate to the church, invariably\r\naccompanies the singing, so that in all Mozart's church compositions the\r\nbass part is carefully figured, sometimes by his father's hand; it is\r\nsometimes, but rarely, employed obbligato, as in the Benedictus (259\r\nK.), and then treated in easy style. Next to the organ come three\r\ntrombones, essentially the support of the chorus, played in virtue of\r\nhis office by the \"stadtthürmermeister\" and two of his subordinates.\r\n[53]\r\n\r\nFollowing ancient tradition they sounded in the tutti in unison with\r\nthe three lower voices of the chorus; the trombones were generally left\r\nunindicated in the score, and only the places marked where they were to\r\nbe silent. This curious prominence of the brass instruments, whereby the\r\nsoprano part is left unrepresented, was usual at that time, and\r\ncould not be dispensed with in the church. Trombones are seldom used\r\nindependently by Mozart, and then in the simplest manner.\r\n\r\nThe stringed instruments served as independent orchestra, and were\r\ngenerally only two violins and violoncello; the\r\n\r\n{ORCHESTRA.}\r\n\r\n(283)\r\n\r\ntenors strengthened the violoncello, which went with the organ bass. The\r\nstringed instruments were strengthened as far as possible and treated\r\nso as to counteract the disadvantage they were at in contrast with the\r\nchorus, trombones and organ. When the violins are not with the voices,\r\nthe passages are disposed so as to have the best effect, and they\r\nfrequently play in unison; this explains the partiality for running\r\npassages for the violins, which are not expressive in themselves, but\r\nserve to amplify the rest. It was a higher task to give the violins a\r\ncharacter really independent of the chorus--to make them carry out their\r\nown motif either in one part only, in opposition to the chorus, or in\r\njoint development. In almost all Mozart's masses the effort is\r\nvisible, at any rate in some places, to treat the stringed instruments\r\nindependently; as his artistic sense matured, they were used more\r\nfreely, and with more careful reference to sound effects. As a variation\r\nin later works, the damper was sometimes employed, and more rarely, the\r\n_pizzicato_.\r\n\r\nBesides stringed instruments, trumpets and drums were generally used,\r\nbeing almost indispensable for solemn high mass. The constant use of\r\ntrumpets, as of trombones (sackbuts), was founded on the Bible, which\r\nspeaks of their employment in the Jewish temple worship; and also\r\ncareful and highly elaborated trumpet music played so considerable a\r\npart in court festivities, that it could not well be dispensed with in\r\nchurch ceremonials. In two masses (139, 167, K.), Mozart has employed,\r\nin addition to the two usual trumpets called \"clarini,\" a tromba,\r\nwhich has only to sound the low notes C and G, and to strengthen the\r\ndrums.[54] As regards other wind instruments, we know that in 1757,\r\n\"Oboes and German flutes were seldom heard in the cathedral, and the\r\nFrench horn, never.\"[55]\r\n\r\nThis severity was afterwards relaxed, until the oboe was used alone or\r\nas the principal wind instrument, generally to support the voice or to\r\nstrengthen the harmony. It was\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(284)\r\n\r\nallowed to assert its own individuality at a later time, but this could\r\nonly be when it retained its proper place among the different combined\r\nwind instruments. Flutes were only rarely used to replace the oboe in\r\nsoft passages; there were no clarinets in Salzburg. Bassoons served, as\r\na rule, only to strengthen the bass; in various places where they, like\r\nthe violoncello, were treated with some degree of independence it was\r\nso indicated in the score. Also when the tenors were associated with\r\nthe wind instruments to complete the harmony they were supported by\r\nthe bassoons. The horns at first closely followed the trumpets, but\r\ngradually attempts were made, by the use of sustained notes, to produce\r\nthe sound effects peculiar to this instrument. The freer treatment of\r\nthe wind instruments passed to the church from the opera, and those\r\npieces which were altogether more freely treated than masses, prepared\r\nthe way for the change. The orchestra of Mozart's two last Litanies is\r\njust as elaborate and careful as that of his operas, and the later one\r\ndoes not only employ obbligato solo instruments, but in many of its\r\nsections approaches modern instrumentation.\r\n\r\nWe are unfortunately in considerable ignorance as to what masters were\r\nstudied by Mozart. What has usually been said of his diligent study\r\nof Bach, Handel, and the Italian masters, is neither demonstrable nor\r\nprobable. There would scarcely be much opportunity at Salzburg for the\r\nstudy of any but Salzburg or south German musicians. It is well known\r\nthat some of these, such as Eberlin, Michael Haydn, and Adlgasser, were\r\nearnestly studied and highly esteemed by Mozart. But he first became\r\nacquainted with Sebastian Bach[56] through Van Swieten in Vienna,\r\nalthough he may have come across detached organ or pianoforte\r\ncompositions in Salzburg. He heard Handel's oratorios as a boy in\r\nLondon, but that was all, and even at Mannheim he took no great interest\r\nin the \"Messiah.\" It was again Van Swieten who led him to this master.\r\n\r\nWe may grant a stronger influence to the Italian masters,\r\n\r\n{ITALIAN INFLUENCE.}\r\n\r\n(285)\r\n\r\nalthough the older Italian church music was only exceptionally used at\r\nSalzburg.\r\n\r\nLeopold Mozart speaks of a Gradual with which he had been much pleased\r\nas being the work of \"the celebrated long-since deceased Lotti\"\r\n(November 13, 1777). But we have seen with what zeal Mozart studied in\r\nItaly; and a youth with his genius learned rapidly, and could at once\r\napprehend and retain whatever would be likely to benefit him. He must\r\nalso have taken home with him from Italy much material for future use,\r\nas we have seen in the case of the compositions of Padre Martini. But\r\nwhat direction these studies took, and how far they extended, we are not\r\ninformed. It is not probable that Mozart studied the old masters with\r\nthe intention of forming his own style on theirs, but rather that he\r\nmight gain that surer practice in technicalities which the tasks before\r\nhim required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOOTNOTES OF CHAPTER 13\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Schubart, Teutsch.

INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.\r\n\r\nDURING the last half of the eighteenth century it had become the fashion\r\nin Italy and elsewhere to perform detached instrumental pieces as\r\nintroductions or intermezzi during the pauses in Divine service.[1] They\r\nwere written in the then customary symphony form; music of a lively and\r\nsecular tone not being thought out of place in churches.[2] Brilliancy\r\nof effect was provided for by doubling the orchestra and other\r\nmechanical means,[3] besides forcible composition. Further innovations\r\nwere made in allowing solo vocalists an opportunity of displaying their\r\npowers in church music;\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(286)\r\n\r\nand, as a necessary consequence, distinguished instrumental performers\r\nalso were allowed to add their share to the attractions of Divine\r\nworship.[4] Instrumental concertos were played usually at the conclusion\r\nof the service, without any regard to an ecclesiastical character.[5] We\r\ngather from Dittersdorf's account[6] of his competition with Spagnoletti\r\nat the festival of St. Paul at Bologna and its result, that fine\r\nperformances were thought as much of in the churches as in theatres and\r\nconcerts.\r\n\r\nAt Salzburg, as Mozart tells Padre Martini (p. 244), a sonata was\r\nintroduced between the epistle and the gospel, until Archbishop\r\nHieronymus replaced it by a gradual in 1763.[7] Seventeen compositions\r\nby Mozart of this kind are preserved. The earliest of certain date\r\nbelongs to 1775 (212 K.), and others to 1776 (241, 244, 245, 263, K.)\r\nand 1777 (274, 278, K.), but there are several almost certainly of\r\nearlier date. His sacred sonatas were performed even during his absence,\r\naccording to his father (September 25, 1777). After his return, he\r\ncomposed three pieces of the kind, the last in March, 1780 (328, 329,\r\n336, K.).\r\n\r\nThey are all inscribed as sonatas, and all consist of a lively movement\r\nof moderate length in two parts, and in regulation sonata form. The\r\nchurch sonatas (sonad di chiesa) differ, indeed, from chamber sonatas\r\n(sonad di camera) in being serious, dignified, often fugued and in\r\ncounterpoint, but the style has nothing in it that suggests a sacred\r\nperformance. The tone is neither solemn nor devotional, nor is the style\r\nsevere. The tone and treatment of the commencement remind us of the\r\nfirst movements of the smaller sonatas and quartets; the subjects are\r\nsmall, sometimes very pretty'; the treatment is free and skilful, and in\r\nthe later pieces not without touches of Mozart's originality. They are\r\nusually written for two violins and violoncello, to which the organ was\r\nalways added, but never\r\n\r\n{ORGAN SONATAS--NOBLE AMATEURS.}\r\n\r\n(287)\r\n\r\nobbligato nor with any regard to executive display; it has often only\r\nits customary office of accompaniment to the violoncello, in which case\r\na figured bass part is written. Even when the organ part is independent\r\nit is for the most part limited to what the skilful organist can make\r\nout of the _continuo;_ its independence is very modest, and it never\r\naspires to a solo or any passages. Sometimes trumpets and drums are\r\nadded (263 K.) as well as oboes (278 K.) and horns (329 K.). With the\r\nextension of the orchestra the design and treatment became grander and\r\nmore impressive, but still kept within comparatively narrow limits.\r\nUnhappily these organ sonatas give us not the faintest idea of Mozart's\r\nmuch-admired organ-playing.\r\n\r\nNot only were these compositions composed for special occasions, but\r\nall instrumental music at that time was in this sense occasional music.\r\nOrchestral compositions were, with few exceptions, written with a\r\ndefinite aim and under given conditions.\r\n\r\nMusical performances were the customary evening entertainments given\r\nby distinguished or wealthy persons, in default of better, such as\r\nthe theatre. Those who maintained their own _Kapelle_ required\r\ndaily performances, and in the evening, whether they were alone or\r\nentertaining company, a well-appointed concert. Sometimes noble gentler\r\nmen became so proficient on some instrument that it pleased them to take\r\npersonal part in such concerts. Not to mention the noted examples of\r\nFrederick the Great and the Emperor Joseph, the Elector Maximilian III.\r\nof Bavaria was a performer on the bass-viol, and took part in the court\r\nconcerts, where his sister, Maria Antonia of Saxony, appeared as a\r\nsinger; sometimes also he played the violin in the symphony.[8] The\r\nflute was an instrument much in vogue with noble amateurs, and was\r\nplayed by the Margrave Friedrich von Bayreuth,[9] Duke Karl von\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.\r\n\r\n(288)\r\n\r\nCurland,[10] and Prince Joseph Friedrich von Hildburghausen;[11] the\r\nElector Karl Theodore, played the violoncello,[12] Prince Nicolaus\r\nEsterhazy the baritone,[13] Archduke Maximilian the tenor.[14]\r\nArchbishop Hieronymus adopted the violin[15] as his instrument, after\r\nthe example of the Emperor Peter III.[16] and the Crown Prince Karl\r\nWilhelm Ferdinand von Braunschweig, and he amused himself with it alone\r\nafter dinner;[17] in the evening he took part in the concerts given by\r\nhis choir.[18] L. Mozart writes to his son, who had a great dislike\r\nto violin-playing in court music: \"As a connoisseur, you will not be\r\nashamed of the violin-playing in the first symphony, any more than the\r\nArchbishop and all the cavaliers who take part in it.\" The distinguished\r\namateurs did not indeed always improve the orchestra. On one occasion,\r\nthe Empress Maria Theresa having remarked in an undertone to Haydn\r\nthat she wondered what would become of four noble amateurs, who were\r\nperforming with him, if left to themselves, he played her the joke\r\nof quietly absenting himself with his next colleague, and enjoyed the\r\ncomplete discomfiture of the gentlemen. Brunetti, who always stood at\r\nthe Archbishop's side, used at difficult places quietly to take down his\r\nviola and strike in; the Archbishop let it pass, and used even to say\r\nwhen he came to these places, \"now Brunetti will come in.\" Mozart had\r\nnot the most favourable opinion of the Archbishop's musical knowledge.\r\nHe writes to his father (Vienna, September 26, 1781) about the famous\r\nbass singer, Fischer, \"who has certainly an excellent bass voice,\r\nalthough the Archbishop told him he sang too low for a bass, upon which\r\nI assured His Grace that he would sing higher next time.\"\r\n\r\n{COURT CONCERTS---THEIR LENGTH.}\r\n\r\n(289)\r\n\r\nPublic performers took the principal parts in these concerts, which fact\r\nwas taken into consideration in forming the choir; care was taken to\r\nattract foreign artists, and in the larger towns many public performers\r\ndepended on the daily concerts for their means of subsistence.[19] The\r\nperformances were long, and included a great deal of orchestral music.\r\nCount Firmian's musical soirées lasted from five to eleven o'clock, and\r\nat one concert several symphonies by J. C. Bach and four symphonies\r\nby Martini were played.[20] Dittersdorf produced twelve new violin\r\nconcertos by Benda on one evening;[21] at a concert given by the Elector\r\nof Bavaria Burney heard two symphonies by Schwindl, a song by Panzacchi,\r\na scena by the Electress of Saxony, a trio for bass-viols by the\r\nElector, a song by Rauzzini, a song by Guadagni, and a bass-viol solo by\r\nthe Elector;, and at a private concert in Dresden both parts contained a\r\nsymphony, a violin concerto, a flute concerto, and an oboe concerto.[22]\r\nThe evening's amusement was generally further provided for by\r\ncard-playing and conversation. Archbishop Hieronymus limited the\r\nduration of his concerts. L. Mozart wrote to his son (September 17,\r\n1778) that they only lasted from seven to a quarter past eight, and\r\nincluded only four pieces--a symphony, a song, another symphony or\r\nconcerto, another song, and then _addio_.[23] The court composer took\r\nthe direction of the court music in turn with the kapellmeister every\r\nalternate week, and the director for the time being had the choice and\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(290)\r\n\r\narrangement of the music[24] except so far as it was dictated by\r\nsuperior authority.\r\n\r\nThe position of Mozart's father gave him constant opportunities of\r\nbringing his son's instrumental compositions before the public. The\r\nfame of the band was enhanced by the performance of works by one of the\r\nmembers, and at every festival something new was performed. Dittersdorf\r\nrelates that for the fête-day of the Bishop of Grosswardein he composed\r\nnot only a grand cantata with choruses and a solo cantata, but also two\r\ngrand symphonies at the beginning and close, a middle symphony, with\r\nobbligato wind instruments, and a violin concerto.[25] In a similar\r\nposition, under Prince Esterhazy, Josef Hadyn produced his incredibly\r\nnumerous instrumental compositions. Mozart's fertility during the period\r\nof his independent activity at Salzburg, from 1770 to the autumn of\r\n1777, was equally great, but the merit of industry and fertility was one\r\nwhich these great masters shared with many contemporary lesser ones.\r\n\r\nThe skilful treatment of the orchestra rests mainly on the composer\r\nbeing so imbued with the spirit of the work as a whole as to be able to\r\nrender the separate parts conducive to the general effect. This can only\r\nbe accomplished by continuous practical study.\r\n\r\nMost especially fortunate was Mozart, whose numerous appointed tasks,\r\nnot being merely abstract exercises, served him as studies for his\r\nworks. The danger was indeed great that the influence of the schools and\r\nthe force of traditional forms would tend to mechanical routine, but\r\nit afforded another proof of Mozart's creative nature, that his\r\nunintermittent labour in mastering the technicalities of his art never\r\ninterfered with the spiritual side of his genius.\r\n\r\nMany forms were in use for instrumental composition during the last\r\ncentury, of which, at the present day, we can scarcely even distinguish\r\nthe names or define the limits. The so-called French symphony (or\r\noverture) introduced by Lulli, and established through the school of\r\nScarlatti,\r\n\r\n{SYMPHONIES OR OVERTURES.}\r\n\r\n(291)\r\n\r\nconsists of a short slow movement preceding a longer and more varied\r\none, and repeated at the close. This was opposed to the Italian\r\nsymphony, which contained three movements: an allegro at the beginning\r\nand another at the end, separated by a slow movement in effective\r\ncontrast to them both. The first and the last allegro were, however,\r\ndifferent in character, the second being the quicker and more cheerful\r\nof the two.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to sever the slender connection between the symphony and\r\nthe opera; and operatic symphonies were soon performed alone, as may\r\nbe proved by the symphonies to the \"Finta Semplice,\" the \"Sogno di\r\nScipione\" and \"Lucio Silla.\"\r\n\r\nThe continual demand for new symphonies co-operated with the increasing\r\ncapacity of the instrumentalists, and the fuller appointments of the\r\norchestra, in developing their importance and independence. In Italy,\r\nSammartini, commissioned by the governor, Pallavicini, first wrote\r\nsymphonies for full orchestra; he divided the tenors from the\r\nvioloncelli, gave the second violins an independent part, and rendered\r\nservice also to the technicalities of playing.[26] In Germany the\r\ncomposers of the Mannheim Kapelle, who were of the first rank,\r\nintroduced this kind of composition with great success;[27] but Jos.\r\nHaydn, who surpassed them all in his inexhaustible wealth of productive\r\npower and in his thorough knowledge of his art, threw them quite into\r\nthe shade, and may justly be considered as the creator of the symphony.\r\n\r\nThe three movements were originally connected; but when the symphonies\r\nbecame independent of the opera, this was only exceptionally the case\r\n(74, 181, 184, K.).\r\n\r\nThe last Symphony of the year 1773 shows that even in its maturity an\r\nartistic mind may cling to long-established customs. The delicately\r\nelaborated Andante, full of original\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(292)\r\n\r\nand tender sentiment, forms the climax of the work. The animated Allegro\r\nwhich precedes it is, with just discrimination, toned down towards the\r\nend to prepare for the Andante, whose yearning pathos leaves the mind\r\nunsatisfied, and whose subjects are arranged to favour the transition\r\nto the lively and restless concluding movement. As a rule, however, each\r\nmovement was treated as a self-contained whole, which gave freer scope\r\nfor the development of a definite idea.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of the separate movements the clavier sonata (in the\r\nperfect form given to it by Ph. Eman. Bach, acknowledged as a master by\r\nHaydn himself)[28] had a very considerable influence.\r\n\r\nThe first allegro was always in two parts; a short slow movement,\r\nperhaps a reminiscence of the French symphony, was prefixed to it by\r\nHaydn often, by Mozart rarely. A compact arrangement of well-defined\r\nsubjects takes the place of the long-drawn thread of loosely connected\r\nphrases of the older symphonies. The first subject gives the tone of the\r\nmovement, a second follows, contrasting in expression and structure, and\r\ngenerally a third is added; the connection is by means of free passages.\r\nIt was long held as a fixed rule that the first theme should close on\r\nthe subdominant, and that the second theme should be in the key of the\r\ndominant, in which also the first part of the movement concludes. In the\r\nsecond part the elaboration of the subjects begins. The composer might\r\nplease himself as to which of the subjects, or how many or in what new\r\ncombinations they were to be carried on; nor was there any definite rule\r\nas to the method of elaboration, except that it always led back to the\r\nprincipal key and the first theme, which closed on the dominant, and was\r\nfollowed by the second theme, also in the principal key; the first part\r\nmight either be simply repeated with these modifications, or the change\r\nof key might be thoroughly carried out. Sometimes the second part was\r\nalso repeated; and then followed the final winding-up by a coda, which\r\nrecurs to one or more of the chief subjects, and which was employed even\r\nwhen the\r\n\r\n{THE SYMPHONY.}\r\n\r\n(293)\r\n\r\nsecond part was not repeated. The elements of this form had already been\r\ngiven in the aria, with its one main idea and its contrasting\r\nmotifs; but the organic perfection of the form was first attained by\r\ninstrumental music.\r\n\r\nPh. Eman. Bach declared that the chief and best quality of music was\r\nmelody,[29] and this principle once recognised, the laws of song were\r\nadopted by instrumental music, although with many modifications, to\r\nsuit the different characters of the instruments and the necessities of\r\nthematic elaboration. The chief improvement was the spirited development\r\nof one or more subjects to replace the tedious middle movement of the\r\naria. The artistic development of the separate elements, according to\r\ntheir true significance, introduced both contrast and climax; unity was\r\nassured, since nothing foreign either to the form or the substance\r\nwas admitted; while the repetition of the first part, like a dialectic\r\nexposition of an argument, provided a clear and satisfying conclusion.\r\nThis working-out part did not always receive its due share of honour,\r\nand was often treated as a form of harmonic transition; but it asserts\r\nitself more and more as the proper nucleus of the whole movement, and\r\nhas an important reaction on the formation and phrasing of the first\r\npart. This becomes, as it were, the foundation prepared for the future\r\ndevelopment which first displays the whole extent of the conception.\r\nThe coda was usually confined to a lengthened development of the closing\r\nphrase, and gathered to a point in pregnant brevity the most essential\r\nelements of the movement. It had its counterpart in the cadenza of the\r\naria. After what manner great vocalists constructed their cadenzas we\r\nare unfortunately ignorant, but instrumental cadenzas reproduced the\r\nprincipal subjects of the movement, just as was the case in the coda.\r\nBeethoven, who brought the coda to perfection, has himself worked out\r\nthe cadenzas in the Concerto in E flat major; the cadenza in the\r\nfirst part is identical in mechanism with the coda of one of his great\r\nsymphonies.\r\n\r\nThe original middle movement has preserved a slower\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(294)\r\n\r\ntempo and a moderate tone, with simplicity both of design and\r\ncomposition. The point of departure is the air (lied, romanze), or the\r\ncavatine of operatic creation. Mozart, for instance, took a melodious\r\nduet from his opera of \"Hyacinthus,\" for the Andante of a symphony (p.\r\n94). There is no question here of artistic symmetry or elaboration of\r\nsubjects; one main subject dominates the whole, often smothered with\r\nembellishments, as the original stem of a tree is hidden by the creepers\r\nwhich grow from its roots. The Andante is often, though not necessarily,\r\ndivided into two parts, one or both of them to be repeated, sometimes\r\nwith a coda added. In the second part a new statement of the subject\r\ngenerally takes the place of its actual development, and the contrast\r\nof major and minor keys is made use of. Frequent repetition of a simple\r\ntheme led to the introduction of variations, sometimes strict, sometimes\r\nfree in form, but in depth and originality always far inferior to\r\nthematic elaboration in the proper sense of the term. The Andante,\r\ntherefore, long continued to be of minor importance, both as to length,\r\nform, and substance.\r\n\r\nIt required not only the mastery of musical theory, but the complete\r\nabsorption of the individual in the artist before the innermost\r\nsentiments of the human heart in all their depth and fulness could be\r\nexpressed in simple form, as the poet expresses them in lyric verse. The\r\nAdagio of instrumental music is, in its most perfect form, essentially\r\na German creation, but it became what it is apart from the influence of\r\nthe newly awakened German poetry; each in its separate sphere felt the\r\nvivifying spirit of the age like the fresh breath of spring, and awoke\r\ntogether to life and beauty.[30] As the substance of the slow movement\r\ngrew in interest and importance, the form also became fuller and richer,\r\nwithout, however, any essential alteration; the most magnificent of slow\r\nmovements have all the main points that we have\r\n\r\n{SUITE--MINUET.}\r\n\r\n(295)\r\n\r\nnoticed above, and are only in details freer and more full of life and\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThe closing movement, generally in 3-8, 6-8, or 2-4 time, has something\r\nof a dance tone, though not of set purpose. The rondo form, very\r\nfreely treated, soon became predominant. The impressiveness of frequent\r\nrepetition of the same melody, the freedom and ease with which the\r\nconnecting phrases could be treated, the surprises to which ingenious\r\nreturns to the theme gave rise, all made this easy form very appropriate\r\nto a closing movement. What was demanded from instrumental music was\r\nsuch a pleasant sense of enjoyment as should relax the mind without\r\nstraining the attention, and a cheerful conclusion was considered\r\nessential. But by a singular inconsistency the last movement was\r\nsometimes made the field for the display of skill in counterpoint;\r\nmasters of the art required that a genuine artist should know how\r\nto render cheerfulness and whimsicality, spirit and fun, even in\r\nthe strictest forms. So it is customary to this day to introduce\r\ncontrapuntal work into the scherzo, the proper field for musical wit and\r\nhumour. This, too, is a production of German instrumental music.\r\n\r\nTo the three original movements of the symphony the minuet was added\r\nas a fourth, suggested probably by the Suite. The Suite, whether for\r\norchestra or clavier, came to perfection in the seventeenth century, and\r\nconsisted of a succession of dances in the same key, but differing\r\nin time, rhythm, and expression, and for the most part highly\r\ncharacteristic. Mattheson enumerates them as follows: minuet, gavotte,\r\nbourrée, rigaudon, gigue, polonaise, anglaise (country-dances, ballads,\r\nhornpipes), passepied, sarabande, courante, allemande;[31] others give\r\nallemande, courante, gigue, passa-caille, gavotte, minuet, chaconne,\r\nthe chief forms being allemande, courante, sarabande, and gigue. An\r\nintroduction, prelude, fantasia, or overture, preceded the dances,\r\nconsisting, after the French fashion, of a slow and a lively\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(296)\r\n\r\nmovement, the latter generally elaborated, and returning to the former\r\nas a conclusion.[32] It is evident that the suite was the foundation of\r\nthe Italian operatic symphonies--not of our modern symphony and sonata\r\nforms--but much was doubtless borrowed from the long list of dances as\r\nembellishment to the symphony proper. Whether or not Josef Haydn was the\r\nfirst to introduce the minuet into the symphony, it was he undoubtedly\r\nwho gave it its peculiar and typical character. The minuet was the\r\ndance of good society, affording opportunity for the display of dignity,\r\ngrace, and deportment. We cannot hear those minuets which best reflect\r\nthe character of the dance without thinking of powder and hoops; and\r\nnow that the manners it suggests have become obsolete, it can only be\r\nhumorously reproduced.[33] Haydn did not parody the minuet of his time,\r\nbut he divested it of its distinguishing dignity; he took it as it was\r\ndanced by the middle-classes, and filled it with national cheerfulness\r\nand good-humour. He represented a certain amount of joviality and\r\nrollicking fun which would have been inadmissible in the _salons_ of the\r\n_noblesse_, and he was inexhaustible in witty suggestions and surprises,\r\nwithout any taint of vulgarity or carelessness of musical treatment.\r\nThis was being popular in the best sense of the word; the spirit was\r\ngenuinely national, the form truly artistic; and so the minuet took its\r\nplace in the symphony, and kept it. The position given to it in relation\r\nto the longer movements varied in early days; Mozart generally places it\r\nafter the andante.\r\n\r\nMozart's first symphonies have only three movements, and it is perhaps\r\nnot merely accidentally that the minuet is first introduced in the\r\nsymphonies composed at Vienna in 1767 and 1768, but it is sometimes\r\nwanting in later works.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to trace in his youthful works Mozart's\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S SYMPHONIES.}\r\n\r\n(297)\r\n\r\ngradual progress in mechanism and practical skill. At first there is\r\nlittle melodious invention, but a sense of effect and a knowledge\r\nof form always exist, and by degrees the symphonies acquire body and\r\ncharacter. Command of the orchestra makes itself felt by degrees; first\r\nthe separate parts become free and independent, a special movement is\r\ngiven to the second violins by characteristic passages and imitative\r\ntreatment, and the basses too gain life and independence; they are\r\nin free imitation for the first time in a Symphony in G major (no K.)\r\nbelonging to the year 1771. As development proceeded the subjects became\r\nfuller, and the whole work gained in consistency and substance, although\r\nit still wanted finish and elaboration. The peculiar character of the\r\nstring quartet became more and more prominent; for a long time it formed\r\nthe nucleus of the symphony, the wind instruments strengthening\r\nthe harmonies and emphasising some particular melody, but only very\r\ngradually contributing to effects of light and shade. Oboes and horns,\r\ntrumpets too (generally without drums), are combined according to rule,\r\nand gave the orchestra a sharp clear tone, which was then admired;\r\nflutes were employed in movements of a gentle character, usually with\r\nmuted stringed instruments. It was not until later that the bassoons\r\nwere made independent of the basses, and then they served, like the\r\ntenors, for middle parts. Many and diverse experiments were made in the\r\nemployment of new instrumental forces before the various parts of the\r\norchestra were successfully combined into a self-contained and living\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nNothing whatever is known of Mozart's models in his instrumental music.\r\nWe may take for granted that he knew Josef Haydn's symphonies, and\r\nthat they were not without some influence on his genius; but few actual\r\ntraces of them can be discovered, while his conception of the minuet was\r\naltogether different, and remained peculiarly his own.[34]\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(298)\r\n\r\nThe jovial humour and the delight in musical drollery which are Haydn's\r\ncharacteristics are never predominant with Mozart; he preserves\r\na national tone, truly, but the interest it excites is due to the\r\nennobling and beautifying spirit which he throws into it. This side of\r\nMozart's nature appears even in his earlier works, and makes us the more\r\nready to ascribe any lapse into fun and drollery to the direct influence\r\nof Haydn. The last symphony, in E flat major, which is avowedly\r\nambitious in conception, betrays undoubted external influence. Both\r\nthe minuet and the lengthy and elaborate concluding rondo are decided\r\nimitations of Haydn. The andante is somewhat constrained ami unnatural,\r\nbut there is a second and later andante at the close, which is much\r\nsimpler.\r\n\r\nMozart's instrumental compositions up to the year 1772 are only\r\ninteresting in so far as they show us how gradually and surely he gained\r\npossession of all the means his art could place at his command;[35]\r\nbut from this date they begin to acquire an independent interest. It is\r\nremarkable that we possess no symphonies composed by Mozart between 1775\r\nand 1777. Reflecting how carefully all the compositions of this time\r\nhave been preserved, it is not probable that any can have been lost by\r\naccident. On the other hand most of the great serenades and concertos\r\nfor violin and piano fall within these years; and it is quite possible\r\nthat Mozart's growing discontent with his position and the displeasure\r\nof the Archbishop may have caused him to desist\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S SYMPHONIES.}\r\n\r\n(299)\r\n\r\nfrom writing symphonies which were primarily intended for performance\r\nat court concerts. We have further proof that Mozart wrote no symphonies\r\nduring these years in a letter from his father, on September 24, 1778,\r\nwhere he says: \"When a thing does you no credit, it is better that it\r\nshould be forgotten. I have sent you none of your symphonies because\r\nI feel sure that when you have come to riper years, and have a clearer\r\njudgment, you will be glad that they are forgotten, even though you may\r\nbe satisfied with them now.\"\r\n\r\nEven the more important among the later symphonies are sparing in the\r\nuse of means, and precise in form, as indeed they were obliged to be,\r\nconsidering that several symphonies were performed in one evening.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Mozart writes to his father from Paris (September 11, 1778) that\r\nhe could not produce his symphonies there, since they did not suit the\r\nFrench taste: \"We Germans like long pieces, but in truth they are better\r\nshort and good.\" Progress is shown in greater freedom of treatment; the\r\nfirst movement of a Symphony in D major (202 K.) and the last movement\r\nof the Symphonies in G major (199 K.) and C major (200 K.), all\r\nbelonging to 1774, are full of life and vigour. These qualities\r\npresuppose more individuality in the details, the interludes are\r\ndeveloped with more independence, and the loosely connected violin and\r\nvioloncello passages disappear altogether. Many of Mozart's special\r\ncharacteristics exist side by side with turns of expression common to\r\nthe time; for instance, the second theme is sometimes an offshoot from\r\nthe first, and the introduction of a new subject at the close of the\r\npart often gives a new impetus to the movement.\r\n\r\nThe Symphonies in G minor (183 K.) and in A major (201 K.) may serve as\r\nvery opposite examples of Mozart's works of the kind. The first has a\r\nserious tone from the first subject onwards, the minuet and finale more\r\nespecially being almost gloomy in tone, and the andante the same, only\r\nsomewhat softened down. The second is full from beginning to end of\r\ncheerful humour and tender grace, and may serve as an example of the way\r\nin which a work of art\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(300)\r\n\r\nof perfect mechanism and delicate shading may be produced from the\r\nsimplest materials.\r\n\r\nIf the minuets alone of the two symphonies be compared, it will be\r\nacknowledged that an artist who within such confined limits can produce\r\nimpressions of delicate wit and humour on the one hand, and of gloomy\r\ndiscontent and agitation on the other, has a full mastery of the forms\r\nand capabilities of instrumental music.\r\n\r\nThe symphonies of that time do not, as a rule, attempt to express\r\npassion or tragic emotion. They were, with few exceptions, intended to\r\npromote social enjoyment; consequently their essential characteristics\r\nare animation and brilliancy, or else calm serenity. The composer\r\nconcentrated his efforts on the form and mechanism of his composition;\r\nto express deep feeling or the secrets of his own heart would have been\r\nalike impossible to him as an artist and contrary to the spirit of the\r\ntime. A sharp line of division was drawn in theory and practice between\r\nhuman and artistic emotions, and any display of subjective emotion was\r\ndiscouraged. In the year 1774 \"Werther\" appeared; the strivings and\r\nconflicts of the time which produced it had their influence on music;\r\nbut music had to pass through a longer and more arduous struggle before\r\nattaining to a like freedom of inspiration and expression.\r\n\r\nThe evident striving of the youthful Mozart to express himself and his\r\ninnermost feelings in his music affords a significant indication of his\r\ndevelopment as an artist. Life had not taught him the lessons of passion\r\nand disappointment, and his nature was too sound and healthy to attempt\r\nto anticipate or represent emotions which had not touched him; he shows\r\nhimself to us as he is.\r\n\r\nThe symphony was not then, as it is now, the grandest and most\r\ncomprehensive form of orchestral music. The first place was given to\r\nthe so-called serenata, a name originating in the circumstances of its\r\ncomposition, and scarcely applied to a fixed or well-defined form. The\r\nserenata was distinguished from the symphony in its narrow sense by\r\ngreater variety and wealth of ideas and treatment. Several instruments\r\nare often grouped together in different combinations,\r\n\r\n{THE SERENADE.}\r\n\r\n(301)\r\n\r\nand solo instruments are variously employed; also the number of separate\r\nmovements often reaches as many as eight.\r\n\r\nFor the arrangement and manipulation of the movements the perfected\r\nforms of the symphony are employed, but with numerous modifications.\r\n\r\nSerenades were introduced and sometimes also concluded by a march\r\n(39, K.). This was concise in form and simple in treatment, very often\r\nwithout even a trio; it was generally lively and cheerful. The detached\r\nmarches by Mozart which are preserved were doubtless intended for\r\nintroductions to serenades; they were often transferred from one to\r\nanother, and so were written separately.\r\n\r\nThe minuet is almost invariably inserted between each andante and\r\nallegro, and therefore occurs two or three times in the symphony. The\r\nomission of all the other forms of dance music, so amply represented\r\nin the suite, is a proof that this form of instrumental music was not\r\nintended for practical use, at least in this juxtaposition. Variations\r\nwere sometimes made in the character of the minuets by changes in\r\nthe instrumentation, more especially in the trio. Several trios were\r\nfrequently given to one minuet with appropriate instrumentation, making\r\nuse of obbligato violins (185, 203, 204, 250, K.), flutes (204 K.),\r\ntrumpets (250 K.), and sometimes the stringed instruments alone (100,\r\n250, K.).\r\n\r\nA grand allegro in two parts, as a commencement, and an allegro or\r\npresto at the close, sometimes introduced by a short adagio, form the\r\nmain substance of the serenade as well as of the symphony, and the\r\nmovements are similarly treated. The slow movement between them is in\r\nits turn between two minuets (62 K.), and there are sometimes two\r\nslow movements, each with a minuet appertaining to them (99 K.), and\r\ncharacterised by varied instrumentation. As time went on, an allegro was\r\ninserted between the two slow movements, which, however, was rendered\r\ndistinct from the two principal quick movements by its lighter colouring\r\nand tone; the instruments, too, are grouped with more diversity. For\r\ninstance (185 K.), the oboe and horn are employed obbligato in the first\r\nandante and the\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(302)\r\n\r\nfollowing allegro, and in the second andante flutes are combined with\r\nthe stringed instruments.\r\n\r\nA singular use is sometimes made of obbligato violins in the serenade\r\n(185,,203, 204, 214, 215, 237, 239, 250, K.). After the first allegro,\r\nthe solo violins lead in three movements, viz.: andante, minuet, and\r\nallegro (rondo, 250 K.) which are in a measure complete in themselves,\r\nand form, apart from their surroundings, a complete symphony. The\r\nexpression \"finalmusik,\" which frequently occurs in Mozart's letters,\r\nseems to prove that these lengthy compositions, with their concerted\r\nsolo instruments, formed the conclusion of the concert. The\r\n\"concertantsymphonie\" of the two last serenades belonging to 1774\r\nand 1775 (204, 250, K.), are conspicuous from their peculiar\r\ninstrumentation. In the other movements the usual oboes, horns, and\r\ntrumpets are used as accompaniment to the obbligato violins, flutes,\r\nhorns, and bassoons, and in the last movement especially the combination\r\nand treatment are quite modern. These two serenades show altogether a\r\nmarked improvement on the earlier ones, which do not essentially differ\r\nfrom symphonies. The orchestra is firmly handled, and the orchestral\r\nsubjects freely elaborated. Each of the many movements of the last\r\nserenade is worked out as carefully and lovingly as if it were the\r\nonly one, and the ideas and motifs are so full of meaning and of jovial\r\ngood-humour that it is impossible not to feel that Mozart has here put\r\nforth his best powers.\r\n\r\nA short serenata (239 K.), consisting of a march, minuet, and rondo,\r\ninterrupted by a short adagio, was written in January, 1776, for\r\nstringed instruments and drums only. A sort of chorus of two solo\r\nviolins, accompanied by violas and violoncelli, is opposed to another,\r\ncomposed of two violins, viola, and violoncello, with the drums, all\r\ntreated as tutti parts. Such admirable use is made of the contrast and\r\ncombination of the two choruses, of the tutti parts and of varied sound\r\neffects, such as _pizzicato, &.c_., and even the drum is so skilfully\r\nemployed, that this little work has taken a highly original colouring;\r\nwith true tact the separate movements are made short, in order that the\r\n\r\n{SERENADES--CASSATIO, 1771.}\r\n\r\n(303)\r\n\r\nsingular charm of the piece may not suffer from the fatigue of the\r\near.[36]\r\n\r\nThe same praise may be bestowed on a nocturne (286 K.) for four\r\norchestras, each consisting of a stringed quartet and two horns, so\r\narranged as to represent a threefold echo. When the first orchestra has\r\nplayed a connected phrase the second orchestra falls in at the last bar\r\nwith the same, or with the four last bars of the same, the third follows\r\nthe second at the last bar with the three last bars, and the fourth\r\ncomes in in the same way with the two last bars; then the\r\nfirst orchestra continues the theme. In this way all the three\r\nmovements--andante, allegro, and minuet--are managed, with but slight\r\nmodifications; only the trio of the minuet is played by one orchestra\r\nalone, or by all together. It need scarcely be said that the omission of\r\nthe echoes does not affect the connection of the parts. The main point\r\nin such a trifle as this is to carry it out with as little visible\r\nconstraint as possible.\r\n\r\nThere is an especially good effect in the minuet where short passages\r\nfollow each other in rapid succession, falling in at different parts\r\nof the bars, and the way in which in the first part the horns alone\r\nconclude a phrase with--[See Page Image] cutting each other short in\r\nthe most impatient manner, is truly comical.\r\n\r\nSimilar instrumental compositions to this are called by the name of\r\ndivertimento or cassatio (which last term has never been satisfactorily\r\nexplained), in which the various parts are simply arranged.[37] The\r\nfirst of these (113 K.), composed in Milan in 1771, \"Concerto ossia\r\nDivertimento,\" has the four movements of the symphony, the last in rondo\r\nform, and\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(304)\r\n\r\nresembles the symphonies of that time also in the brevity and\r\npreciseness of its arrangement. The strings are not obbligato, the wind\r\ninstruments--two clarinets and two horns--although not concertante,\r\nare more than usually independent. For a later performance, probably in\r\n1773, two oboes, two English horns, and two bassoons were so added that\r\nthe clarinets might be omitted.[38] The stringed instruments were left\r\nuntouched; the strengthening of the wind instruments was utilised for\r\nthe alternations, with slight and clever modifications.\r\n\r\nIn the next divertimento, belonging to June, 1772 (131 K.), consisting\r\nof seven movements, the combination of the different instruments (four\r\nhorns,[39] flutes, oboes, and bassoons) is varied with evident care. The\r\nfirst adagio is for strings alone, the second for wind instruments; the\r\nfirst minuet is for strings, the wind instruments alternate with each\r\nother in the three trios, and all the instruments unite in the coda. In\r\nthe second minuet the four horns are especially prominent; in the\r\nthird movement, an allegretto, the flute is obbligato and the horns\r\nare silent; in the first and last movements all the instruments work\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nA divertimento, singular in many respects, in six movements, for oboes\r\nand two horns, together with stringed instruments, seems to have been\r\nwritten quickly for some special occasion in July, 1776 (54 K.), and\r\nthen to have been laid aside. The score is hurriedly jotted down on\r\nalready used music paper of different shapes, with abbreviations,\r\ndirections for the copyist, and various corrections. The second minuet\r\nhas no trio, but is three times varied. The oboe is prominent and\r\nstriking, not in passages, but in sustained notes and tuneful melodies.\r\nThe stringed instruments, without being actually concertante, enliven\r\nthe whole\r\n\r\n{DIVERTIMENTI, 1776-77.}\r\n\r\n(305)\r\n\r\nby their free arrangement of parts. The national German character of the\r\nmelodies is very noticeable; they remind us in style of popular German\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\nThe alliance of the horns with the strings was a favourite one at the\r\ntime, although the instruments do not readily blend. The freer the\r\nthematic elaboration of the string parts the more difficult it became\r\nfor the horns to keep pace with them, although now and then fine effects\r\nmight be produced by their means.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was so to engraft, as it were, the horns on the stringed\r\ninstruments as to leave them free play for their own natural effects,\r\nand to produce a certain richness and depth of colouring not attainable\r\nwithout their aid.\r\n\r\nIn a divertimento, written about 1773 or 1774 (205 K.), two horns are in\r\nunion with violin, tenor, and violoncello, strengthened by a bassoon.\r\nIt is short and precise, but cleverly written. The adagio is a duet for\r\nviolin and tenor, to a very simple bass, the horns being silent. It must\r\nbe remembered that such pieces as these were always accompanied on the\r\nclavier.\r\n\r\nTwo divertimenti or cassationi, as they are oftener called in the\r\nletters, for string quartet, with two horns (247, 287, K.),[40] were\r\nwritten in June, 1776 and June, 1777, for the fête-day of the Countess\r\nAnt. Lodron; they are finished works of the genuine Mozart type. Both\r\nhave six elaborately worked-out movements, and abound in grace and\r\nfertility of invention, and in skilful harmonic treatment. The style\r\nis that of a true quartet, that is, the instruments have each their\r\nindependent part, but the first violin, as a solo part, is markedly\r\npredominant; in the first divertimento, in F major (247 K.), it sustains\r\nthe melody in every movement, but is bravura and concertante only in the\r\nadagio.\r\n\r\nIn the second divertimento, in B flat major (287 K.), which is grand in\r\ndesign and composition, the first violin is treated as a solo instrument\r\nthroughout, with a strong\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(306)\r\n\r\ntendency to bravura, the remaining instruments co-operating in such\r\na way as to display the creative spirit of an artist in every detail,\r\nhowever delicate or subordinate. In the very first thematically\r\nelaborated passage the solo passages for the violin occur, which it\r\nis the chief concern of the second part to elaborate. The second\r\nplace--which in the former divertimento (247 K.) was given to a simple,\r\nexceedingly graceful andante grazioso, a kind of song without words--is\r\noccupied in the latter (287 K.) by an air with variations, in which all\r\nthe instruments take part, but the violin more prominently, and with\r\nmore of executive bravura than any of the others. This is most apparent\r\nin the two minuets, but it is very decided also in the broadly conceived\r\nadagio, where the second violin and tenor are muted, the violoncello\r\nplays pizzicato, while the first violin leads a melody richly adorned\r\nwith figures and passages, and requiring the execution of a finished\r\nperformer. The use of muted strings, especially in slow movements, was\r\nvery frequent at that time in accompaniments, as well as in symphonies\r\nand quartets, and was intended to produce variety of tone-colouring;\r\nthe violoncello not being muted, but _pizzicato_, afforded a contrast\r\nof tone. The concluding movement is introduced by an andante with a\r\nrecitative for the first violin, not too long, and so worked out that\r\nthe whole compass of the instrument is characteristically displayed. A\r\nlong molto allegro follows this introduction, in 3-8 time, which keeps\r\nthe violinist in constant movement, and gives him an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying the variety of his technical skill; but the movement is\r\ncarefully planned and composed, due consideration being given to each\r\npart in its place. The recitative recurs at the end, followed by a short\r\nand brilliant conclusion. The tone of this movement is not as cheerful\r\nas usual; it is full of impulsive haste and changeful humour, and its\r\nstronger accent betrays a certain intensity, even in the introductory\r\nrecitative.\r\n\r\nThe third divertimento, in D major (334 K.), may be most fitly noticed\r\nhere, although it was not composed till 1779 or 1780, since it accords\r\nin every respect with the two last\r\n\r\n{\"HARMONIEMUSIK.\"}\r\n\r\n(307)\r\n\r\nmentioned.[41] In breadth of conception and grandeur of composition, it\r\nstands nearest to that in B flat major; the first violin is perhaps less\r\nelaborately treated, and the tone of the whole is somewhat calmer and\r\nmore cheerful. Mastery of form in plan, grouping, and arrangement\r\nis perfect in both compositions, as well as freedom and ease in the\r\nelaboration of the subjects, as if they sprang spontaneously forth as\r\nexpressions of thought, each in its proper place and degree. Perhaps\r\nthe first movement is grander in design, and has broader motifs than the\r\nlater work; but the adagio is deeper and more elaborate, and the\r\nlast movement is more original in the B flat major divertimento. The\r\nremaining movements are fairly equal.[42]\r\n\r\nIt was the B flat major divertimento that Mozart played at Munich in\r\n1777, \"as if he was the first violinist in Europe,\" so that \"every one\r\nstared.\" It is evident that difficulty of execution in his composition\r\nfor the violin, which is more noticeable after 1773, kept pace with\r\nMozart's progress as a violinist.[43]\r\n\r\nA style of composition much in vogue at that time was the so-called\r\n\"harmoniemusik,\" for wind instruments alone. Sometimes it was used\r\nas serenades, sometimes people of rank had performances of six- or\r\neight-part harmoniemusik morning and evening, during meals, in which\r\nthey were imitated by the more pretentious tavern-keepers. There\r\nwas opportunity enough for cultivating this branch of composition at\r\nSalzburg.\r\n\r\nIn form these compositions, which were generally called divertimenti or\r\npartite (partie) resembled those just described. They consist of three,\r\nfour, or sometimes more movements, which were grouped without any fixed\r\nrule. One\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(308)\r\n\r\ndivertimento (186 K.) closes with a contredanse en rondeau; another (240 K.)\r\nhas an andante as first movement; then follows a minuet, and then a\r\npolonaise; a third (253 K.) begins with an andante and variations.\r\n\r\nThe two first pieces of this kind are both scored for ten parts, two\r\noboes, two clarinets, two English horns, two French horns, and two\r\nbassoons. Since one of the divertimenti (166 K.) was composed at\r\nSalzburg on March 24, 1773, and the other probably at much the same\r\ntime; and since there were no clarinets in the usual Salzburg orchestra,\r\nthey must have been composed for some very special occasion. But neither\r\nthe plan nor the composition are on a larger scale than usual; the work\r\nis wanting both in extent and expression, and the instrumentation is\r\nneither free nor forcible.\r\n\r\nThere are two striking partites, one consisting of ten, the other of six\r\nmovements, which were written for two flutes, five trumpets (in C and\r\nD), and four drums (in C, G, D, A) (187, 188, K.), about the year 1773\r\nor 1774, apparently to employ the trumpet orchestra on some festival\r\noccasion. Whether the union of flutes with trumpets was founded on\r\nprecedent or not I cannot say. The flutes lead the melody, and have\r\nallotted to them musical passages, connected, but short and unimportant\r\nin substance and style. The trumpets seldom take part in the melody,\r\nbut are for the most part employed either together or separately as\r\naccompaniment; the object has apparently been to preserve the effect\r\nof a body of sound in the trumpets as far as possible, while aiming at\r\ngiving them a definite musical form. In the earlier and more prosperous\r\ntimes of the trumpeters' guild, accomplished masters of horn-playing\r\nwould not have needed the support of flutes.\r\n\r\nIt is of more interest to note how a great master works within narrow\r\nlimits, and with small means at his command, by a consideration of the\r\nsix divertimenti for two oboes, two bassoons, and two horns (213, 240,\r\n252, 253, 270, 289, K.), which were composed between 1775 and 1777.\r\n\r\nThe destination of these trifling pieces, as table-music or such-like,\r\nallows neither greatness of conception nor any\r\n\r\n{THE QUARTET--JOS. HAYDN.}\r\n\r\n(309)\r\n\r\nexpression of deep feeling; all must be pleasing, cheerful, and quickly\r\nover. But Mozart was not content with satisfying these conditions;\r\nhis harmonie-musik is full of delicacy and grace, tender and pure in\r\nconception, and touched with the firm hand of a master. The details\r\nare carefully and neatly handled, without any exaggeration; little side\r\ntouches are scattered freely about--here an imitation, there an original\r\npassage or turn in the middle parts, making the whole interesting\r\nand full of life; happy instrumental effects abound, and by varied\r\ncombinations and changes of tone-colouring the outline of the\r\nsymmetrical structure is thrown into clear relief, in spite of the\r\nlimited means at command; just as a painter in monochrome shades his one\r\ncolour with such skill as to give a plastic roundness to his forms.[44]\r\n\r\nThis species of instrumental composition as it developed became limited,\r\ncuriously enough, to stringed instruments, for the most part in quartets\r\nfor two violins, tenor, and bass (replaced by the violoncello), more\r\nrarely in quintets, with either the tenor or the violoncello doubled, or\r\nin trios. They were still called divertimento or cassation, and did not\r\noriginally differ from this class of composition, either in form or in\r\nliberty as to the number and arrangement of movements.\r\n\r\nThe rule that the quartet (as the whole species came to be called)\r\nshould consist, like the symphony and the sonata, of four fixed\r\nmovements, was laid down by Joseph Haydn. It was his inexhaustibly\r\nfertile invention and his freedom in the treatment of form which\r\nnourished and developed the germ of this chamber-music, until it bore\r\nthe most beautiful blossoms of German musical art. Mozart, destined\r\nlater to surpass in this direction his freely acknowledged example,\r\ndisplays evident tokens of Haydn's influence even in his youth. On the\r\nwhole, however, quartet music does not seem to have enjoyed much favour\r\nin Salzburg; Mozart's\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(310)\r\n\r\nnot very numerous attempts fall in earlier years, and were not all\r\nwritten in Salzburg.\r\n\r\nMozart's first quartet, in G major (80 K.), was composed on the first\r\njourney to Italy, at Lodi, on March 15, 1770, at seven o'clock in\r\nthe evening--a circumstance of which he preserved the memory long\r\nafterwards. The concluding rondo is written in a later hand on different\r\npaper; and perhaps the whole consisted originally of only three\r\nmovements--adagio, allegro and minuet.[45] A clear insight into the\r\nessential conditions of quartet style, freedom and independence of all\r\nthe parts, a concentration of the whole work into a well-defined form,\r\ntogether with a perfection of thematic elaboration, are all plainly\r\ndiscernible in this first attempt, which, unimportant and wanting in\r\noriginality as it may be, yet gives the impression of a well-rounded\r\npiece of workmanship. The second violin is worked out independently,\r\nwith special care, in which the tenor participates; less success has\r\nattended the effort for a free movement for the bass. Attempts\r\nin counterpoint--as, for instance, at the beginning of the second\r\npart--are, as might be expected, learner-like, but they show that he\r\nknew what he was about. The last movement betrays a firmer hand from the\r\nvery beginning.\r\n\r\nThree short divermenti follow, in D, B flat, and F major (136-138, K.),\r\neach having three movements, composed at Salzburg in 1772, precise and\r\nfresh in treatment, but evidently only meant for exercises.\r\n\r\nOn the journey to Milan at the end of October, 1772, Wolfgang beguiled\r\nthe tedium of the way by composing a \"quattro\"; and in Milan he\r\nwas again (February 6, 1773) busy with a quartet under his father's\r\ndirections. This no doubt belongs to a succession of six quartets in\r\nD, G, C, F, B flat, and E flat major (155-160, K.), which, judging from\r\nstyle and handwriting, fall within this period. They consist each of\r\nthree movements, two closing with the minuet (156, 158, K.), while the\r\npresto, 3-8, with which the first begins has quite the form of a closing\r\nmovement. The adagio\r\n\r\n{QUARTETS, 1772.}\r\n\r\n(311)\r\n\r\nwhich follows it is unusually serious--a simple melody with a uniform\r\naccompaniment in rich harmonies. This is erased and another substituted,\r\nwhich is longer and more elaborate, with a freer movement of the parts\r\nand a lighter expression. In other cases the andante begins (as in 137\r\nK.), and is followed by the allegro. These quartets are not of wide\r\nscope, nor are the different movements actually elaborated, but greater\r\npractice in composition is evident throughout.\r\n\r\nThe different motifs are better adapted for elaboration, and there is\r\na remarkable increase of skill in dealing with the smaller divisions of\r\neach part, on the working out of which depend the life and unity of the\r\nwhole conception. The opening phrases, repetitions, &c., are freer and\r\nbetter fitted in; two-part imitation is sometimes neatly introduced and\r\nfluently and gracefully carried out.\r\n\r\nThe composer's power has evidently grown as he worked, and the later\r\nquartets are by far the most original. The second movement of the fifth\r\n(159 K.), an allegro 3-4 in G minor, following an andante in B flat\r\nmajor, has, through its rhythm and modulation, an expression of dry\r\nhumour that is quite suggestive of one of the later scherzos.\r\n\r\nSix quartets, composed in August and September of the same year, at\r\nVienna, stand on a far higher level, and were probably written to order\r\n(168-175, K.). The superscription of the first shows that the whole six\r\nwere planned together; they were written in quick succession, and their\r\nvariety represented the different tendencies of the quartet style.\r\nIn Vienna, of all places, the birthplace and domain of Haydn's\r\nchamber-music, the ambitious youth would exert himself to satisfy the\r\ndemand for the highest class of compositions. Most of them have the\r\napproved four movements, and the composer's invention and execution keep\r\npace with the more extended scope of the composition. The quartets are\r\nmanlier and more mature than in the earlier works of the kind; but the\r\nsingular beauty of form, the grace and freshness of Mozart in his full\r\ndevelopment, only show themselves in momentary gleams of inspiration.\r\n\r\nAn effort to mould the raw material into form by means of skilful\r\nworkmanship, and to make it subservient to the\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(312)\r\n\r\nspirit, is apparent throughout. We can see traces already of the study\r\nand preparatory work which resulted in the fine and serious compositions\r\nof the following year--the Masses in F and D major, and the Litany in D\r\nmajor. First and foremost is apparent the effort to analyse and vary the\r\nmusical materials ready to hand by means of counterpoint. The first\r\nand last quartet end with a thoroughly worked-out fugue, complete with\r\nstretto and inversions. The close of the first fugue ended abruptly;\r\nMozart has therefore erased the last four bars, and has substituted the\r\nsubject in unison, thereby producing a lengthened and very effective\r\nconclusion. The second fugue is not by any means so fresh and lively\r\nas the earlier one, but it is richer in artistic work. Nor are Mozart's\r\nstudies in counterpoint apparent here only. An adagio (168 JK.) begins\r\nwith a four-part canon and retains the same character, although not so\r\nstrictly carried out; in tone and substance this is one of the best\r\nof the series. Imitation is the rule in the elaboration of the first\r\nmovements; and in the last quartet the whole of the first movement in\r\nD minor is built upon one characteristic motif. A free movement of the\r\nparts, a skilful employment of passages, variety of instrumentation,\r\nand other such means for giving life and animation to the music, are\r\ncarefully provided, more especially in the minuets. An examination into\r\ndetails will discover traces of careful and delicate handling throughout\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nThere are more instances of fantastic ideas, generally rhythmical in\r\nform, than are usually found in Mozart; this is owing, no doubt, to\r\nHaydn's influence. The slow movements are for the most part expressive\r\nof simple feeling, the andantino grazioso of the last quartet\r\nbeing especially tender and graceful. The closing rondos are least\r\nsignificant; they are not worked out, and the different parts are put\r\ntogether without any true connection. The demands on the instruments are\r\nincreased in comparison to the earlier quartets, but there is still no\r\nbravura; the first violin leads the parts, but is not treated as a solo\r\ninstrument. In fact all four instruments are treated in essentials as on\r\nan equality, so that the tone and character of the\r\n\r\n{QUINTET, 1772.}\r\n\r\n(313)\r\n\r\nwhole regulate every detail, thus fulfilling a fundamental law in the\r\ncomposition of quartets.\r\n\r\nIt must have been as a result of his Vienna studies that Mozart wrote a\r\nquintet (174 K.) after his return in December of the same year; perhaps\r\nthe example of Michael Haydn had some influence. Mozart writes from\r\nMunich (October 6, 1777) that he had invited Herr Dubreil, a pupil\r\nof Tartini, and that they played \"Haydn's two quintets.\" Joseph Haydn\r\ndeclares, in answer to A. Romberg, who asked him why he has not written\r\nany quintets, that he had never been commissioned to do so;[46] on the\r\nother hand, three quintets by Michael Haydn in F, C, and G major,\r\ndating between 1770 and 1780, now lie before me. Mozart's quintet shows\r\nunmistakable progress; both the plan and execution are broader, and\r\nthere is more of the true Mozart spirit in the conception of the\r\nmotives. It is especially interesting to compare two different\r\nelaborations of the finale which exist.[47] Mozart has taken the primary\r\nsubject of the first work, and treated it independently in the second,\r\nthereby providing a just standard of criticism against himself. The\r\nfirst theme in the later elaboration is quite new, and gives the key to\r\nthe character of the movement; then follows as a contrasting motif the\r\nchief subject of the former work with suitable alterations. Originally\r\nthis consisted of eight bars, and was in three parts--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(314)\r\n\r\nbut afterwards the two first bars form the subject, taken up by one\r\npart after the other; while the minims, which are appended to the rapid\r\nsemiquavers, give an effect of rhythmical and harmonious climax:--[See\r\nPage Image]\r\n\r\nIt results from this that the divisions next following are easier and\r\nmore flowing; while, on the other hand, the preparation for the third\r\nprincipal motif is broader and calmer. This third motif gives occasion\r\nfor an especially happy modification. Originally it ran thus--[See Page\r\nImage]\r\n\r\nand was then repeated entire; but now only the first four bars are\r\nretained, the four last are omitted, and movement and expression\r\nare provided by a shake passage. The conclusion of the first part\r\nis rendered more impressive by a new and broader motif, and more\r\nhomogeneous and concentrated by the recurrence of the first subject. The\r\nworking-out of the second part, which was confined to the elaboration of\r\nthe two first bars of the original motif, is partially retained; but it\r\nis extended by the recurrence and elaboration of the\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S STUDIES.}\r\n\r\n(315)\r\n\r\nprincipal theme. Finally, a new and important climax is introduced in\r\nthe coda by the opposition of the two chief subjects.\r\n\r\nThis work may be taken to prove that Mozart was a severe self-critic,\r\nand was not by any means always content with his first attempts. It can\r\nonly be by chance that no other example of remodelling a composition\r\nhas been preserved; the earlier attempts and studies would, no doubt, be\r\ngenerally destroyed. The greater part of Mozart's works of this period\r\nhave been preserved in carefully written fair copies. We are amazed\r\nat the vigour and ease with which he worked, but it would be wrong to\r\nrepresent him as able to dispense with studies and preparatory sketches,\r\neven for his great works. The creative power of genius is indeed a gift\r\nof nature, but a mastery of art is only acquired by hard labour and\r\npains; strength to labour indefatigably and ability to make the labour\r\nbear fruit are the prerogatives of genius. It would be doing Mozart an\r\ninjustice to deny him the reputation of true and conscientious industry;\r\nthe beauty of perfect work proves not that no labour has been bestowed\r\non it, but that the labour has been successful. Mozart's youth was\r\noccupied with his endeavours to master the forms and materials which he\r\nfound ready to hand, and he would not be likely to neglect studies and\r\nexercises to this end, though he might not think them worth preserving.\r\n\r\nThere must have been little encouragement accorded to quartet music in\r\nSalzburg:[48] after 1773, Mozart composed none until 1784, when he was\r\nin Vienna.[49]\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(316)\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the talent for violin-playing which Mozart\r\ndisplayed at a very early age was carefully cultivated by his father.\r\nHe performed in public on his first journey and at the beginning of the\r\nfirst Italian tour; but by the time they reached Rome he had ceased to\r\nplay in public, though he still continued his studies regularly. It\r\nwas part of his official duty in Salzburg to take the violin at court\r\nconcerts. His father admired Wolfgang's effrontery in taking a violin\r\nfrom one of the orchestra at Vienna in 1773, and performing a concerto\r\nupon it (p. 146). He afterwards devoted more serious attention to the\r\ninstrument, and became a first-rate performer on it, but evidently more\r\nfrom his father's impulse than his own inclination. Not only was the\r\nviolin-playing at court a burden to him, but he seems to have had little\r\nliking for the instrument, and no real confidence in his own powers of\r\nexecution. \"You have no idea yourself how well you play the violin,\"\r\nwrites his father (October 18, 1777); \"if you only do yourself justice,\r\nand play with fire, heartiness, and spirit, you may become the first\r\nviolinist in Europe.\" But, nevertheless, he practised regularly and\r\nindustriously, and his father wrote after he had left home (October 6,\r\n1777): \"I feel a little melancholy whenever I go home, for as I get near\r\nthe house I always imagine that I shall hear your violin going.\" After\r\n1774, Mozart's violin compositions take more of the bravura type, and\r\nafford a good standard of his technical development. He had as a\r\nrival the well-established solo violinist, Brunetti, favoured by the\r\narchbishop as being an Italian, but considered by L. Mozart as inferior\r\nto his son. \"He played your concerto very well,\" wrote L. Mozart\r\n(October 5, 1777), \"but was twice out of tune in the allegro, and once\r\nalmost stuck fast in a cadenza.\" When Brunetti's inconvenient rival\r\nhad left Salzburg, he was ready to do full justice to his performances.\r\n\"Brunetti cannot praise you enough,\" writes the father (October\r\n9, 1777); \"and the other day, when I said you played the violin\r\n'passabilmente,' he cried out, 'Cosa? cazzo! se suonava tutto! questo\r\nera del Principe un puntiglio mal inteso, col suo proprio danno.'\"\r\n\r\n{MOZART AS A VIOLINIST.}\r\n\r\n(317)\r\n\r\nAfter Mozart had left Salzburg in September, 1777, he played the violin\r\nin public both at Munich and Augsburg, and was somewhat ironical over\r\nhis success. \"They all stared,\" he writes from Munich (October 6, 1777);\r\n\"I played as if I were the first violinist in Europe.\" And from Augsburg\r\n(October 24, 1777): \"I played a symphony and Wanhall's Concerto in B\r\nflat for the violin with universal applause. At supper-time I played\r\nthe Strasburg Concerto. It went like oil, and every one praised the\r\nbeautiful, pure tone.\" But these communications ceased later on, and\r\nL. Mozart writes in anxiety (October 9, 1777): \"Have you left off\r\npractising the violin since you were in Munich? I should be very sorry.\"\r\n(November 27, 1777): \"Your violin hangs on its nail; of that I am pretty\r\nsure.\" And so it must have been. He was obliged to play the violin\r\nafterwards in Salzburg; but after his stay in Vienna he never made\r\nproficiency on the instrument his primary object, and it is well known\r\nthat in later years, if he had to take part in a quartet or other\r\nconcerted piece, he selected the viola in preference.\r\n\r\nMozart's most important compositions in this department are of course\r\nhis violin concertos, which were doubtless written in the first place\r\nfor his own use. According to his custom, he went thoroughly into the\r\nsubject from its very foundation, gaining proficiency by continuous work\r\nin the one direction; in 1775 he composed five concertos for the violin\r\n(207, 211,' 216, 218, 219, K.), to which was added a sixth (268 K.), not\r\nby any means slight, fugitive attempts, but carefully conceived works of\r\nconsiderable compass in three movements, allegro, andante or adagio, and\r\nrondo.\r\n\r\nThe first movement, which was the most elaborate, is more suggestive\r\nstill of the aria than is the corresponding movement of the symphonies.\r\nThere is the same fixed alternation between solo and tutti passages, the\r\nsame adornment of the solo part with passages and cadenzas, and indeed\r\nthe whole movement is a reminiscence of the serious aria. On the other\r\nhand, the structure is more condensed and more animated; the passages\r\ngrow out of the principal\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(318)\r\n\r\nsubjects, connecting and adorning them. The movement falls usually into\r\nthree main divisions; the middle one, corresponding to the same division\r\nin the symphony, passes into another key, and elaborates one or more\r\nmotifs more freely than in the symphony, and chiefly by changes of\r\nmodulation and modification of the passages, whereby the repetition of\r\nthe first division is effected. Abundant variety of detail is produced,\r\nchiefly by the different combinations of the solo part and the\r\norchestral accompaniment; the solo passages are not usually of great\r\nlength, solo and tutti alternating often and quickly.\r\n\r\nThe second movement is simple, and rests essentially on the tuneful and\r\nartistic delivery of the cantilene; embellishments are not excluded,\r\nbut they are kept in the background. The character of the movement is\r\ngenerally light and pleasing, but a deeper, though always a cheerful\r\nmood, sometimes makes itself felt. The tone is that of a romance; the\r\npolonaise-like rhythm of the Concerto in D major (211 K.) is peculiar to\r\nit; while the G major concerto (216 K.) has a regular and more broadly\r\nconceived adagio. An adagio in E major (261 K)--composed for Brunetti\r\nin 1776, because another, probably the interesting adagio of the A major\r\nconcerto (219 K.), was too \"studirt,\" as L. Mozart writes (October\r\n9,1777)--maintains a kind of medium; it is more serious in expression\r\nand broader in conception than the romance-like andantes, but on the\r\nwhole it is pleasing and pretty rather than grand.\r\n\r\nThe last movement is, as a rule, in the form of a rondo,[50] in which\r\nthe solo part moves more freely, especially in the connecting middle\r\npassages; the passages altogether have now scope for expansion, the tone\r\nbeing light and cheerful, the form easy. It is not unusual for passages\r\nin different time and measure to alternate in the rondo, as in the\r\nD major concerto (218 K.), where an andantino grazioso, 2-4, and an\r\nallegro ma non troppo, 6-8, alternate. In the G major\r\n\r\n\r\n{VIOLIN CONCERTOS.}\r\n\r\n(319)\r\n\r\nconcerto (216 K.), a cheerful passage in 3-8 is interrupted by an andante\r\nin G minor--[See Page Image] followed by an allegretto in G major--[See\r\nPage Image] that leads back to the first subject. In the A major\r\nconcerto (219 K.), the chief subject is tempo di menuetto, interrupted\r\nby a long allegro, 2-4, in A minor--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nIn both these cases the clearly expressed popular tone of the\r\ninterpolated passages is remarkable, and has a striking and pleasing\r\neffect. The allusion in the letters to the concerto, \"with the\r\nStrasburg\" points to one of these passages: \"The Strasburg dance, which\r\nconsisted merely in graceful movements of the arms and poses of the\r\nbody, was generally executed by a very youthful couple within the circle\r\nof waltzers.\"[51]\r\n\r\nA decided progress is observable in the concertante for violin and\r\nviola[52] with orchestral accompaniment (364 K.), which was probably\r\nwritten in 1780. It displays perfect finish in the conception of the\r\nseparate subjects and passages, power and melody in the development of\r\nthe orchestral accompaniments, and true artistic skill in the placing of\r\nturns and phrases where they will be most effective. It is in the usual\r\nthree movements, but a more solid foundation and wider scope than usual\r\nare given to the form, in order that the two solo instruments may have\r\nfree play; the\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(320)\r\n\r\ntutti passages are longer and more important, which entails more\r\nparticipation by the orchestra in the solo portions. This gives a\r\nsymphony-like character to the whole, to which the solo instruments\r\nadd a peculiar brilliancy. In relation to each other they are simply\r\ntreated. They generally relieve each other, either repeating whole\r\nphrases or sharing them between them; when together, they are mostly in\r\nthirds and sixths, and there seldom occurs a true two-part passage in\r\nwhich the two instruments move freely and independently.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the concertone composed in 1773 (190 K.) is more\r\nartistic in design and in workmanship. Here the orchestra is in contrast\r\nwith two solo violins, to which the oboe is added as a solo instrument;\r\nthe violoncello, though not so freely treated as the others, is also\r\noften solo. The usual concerto form is given to the three movements, the\r\nmiddle movement being romance-like, but more elaborate than usual, to\r\ngive employment to the solo instruments. The violoncello, though it does\r\nnot take a leading part in this movement, has an independent passage\r\nas accompaniment throughout. The last movement is \"tempo di menuetto,\"\r\nresembling those in the violin Concerto in A major (219 K.), the bassoon\r\nconcerto (191 K.), the clavier concerto in C (246 K.), the triple\r\nconcerto (242 K.), and the clavier trio in B flat (254 K.); the form\r\nof the minuet with several trios is treated with some freedom, and\r\napproaches that of the rondo. The forcible and independent treatment\r\nof the orchestra, both in the tutti and the solo passages, gives to\r\nthe whole of this composition the character of a symphony; but the solo\r\nparts are grouped with greater variety, since there are four of them,\r\nand they do not as a rule repeat the same passages or join in unison.\r\nSometimes the violins alternate with each other, sometimes the oboe\r\njoins them or opposes them, sometimes the oboe and violoncello are both\r\nin opposition to the violins, and sometimes all the four instruments\r\nmove independently side by side. A strict and ingenious fugal structure\r\nwas required to give unity to this manifold variety. In the first\r\nallegro especially the motifs are chiefly imitatively treated, and\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S TREATMENT OF THE VIOLIN.}\r\n\r\n(321)\r\n\r\nsometimes the varied rendering of a phrase necessitates a change\r\nof instruments; the coming and going of the instruments and their\r\ncombinations are carefully planned, as well as the part taken by the\r\norchestra in producing the general effect. In the two last movements\r\nalternation is the predominant principle, and the parts are only\r\ningeniously interlaced here and there. The work displays throughout more\r\nof skilful mechanism and clever elaboration than of original invention\r\nand beauty.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of connoisseurs on Mozart's technical treatment of the\r\nviolin tends to show that the difficulties even in solo parts are\r\ncomparatively small, but that an acquaintance with the idiosyncrasies\r\nof the instrument, which could only be gained violin in hand, is always\r\napparent; all is made as smooth and easy as possible for the performer,\r\nat the same time that effects of striking originality are produced. Our\r\nidea of Mozart as a violin-player will gain in interest by a knowledge\r\nof his judgment on other violinists. As a child, he had become\r\nacquainted at Mayence with the violinist Esser, of whom the father\r\nwrites later from Salzburg (December 7, 1780): \"Esser is a merry\r\nold simpleton; but he plays (when he is in earnest) with a firm and\r\nremarkable execution, and has a finer adagio touch than is the case with\r\nmost allegro players. But when he is in a joking mood he plays on the G\r\nstring alone with the greatest ease, and plays pieces with a lead pencil\r\non the strings wonderfully correctly and quickly.[53] He plays the viola\r\nd'amour charmingly.[54] But what struck me as particularly childish was\r\nhis whistling of a recitative and aria equal to any singer, with all\r\nthe expression, flourishes, shakes, &c., in a truly marvellous manner,\r\naccompanying himself on the violin _pizzicato_ At the same time he\r\nlaments that, like the rest of them, he cannot play without grimaces\r\nand absurdities.\" On this point, little Wolfgang, unimpressed by Esser's\r\ntricks and _tours de force_, had said that he played well, but made too\r\nmuch of it, and would do better to stick to what was written.\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(322)\r\n\r\nOf Ign. Frànzl (b. 1730), whom he heard at Mannheim, he wrote to his\r\nfather (November 22, 1777): \"I have had the pleasure of hearing Herr\r\nFrànzl play a concerto on the violin. I was extremely pleased. You know\r\nthat I am no great lover of difficulties. He plays difficult passages\r\nso that one does not know that they are difficult, and thinks one can\r\nimitate him; which is true art. He has also a good round tone, every\r\nnote is correct and clear; he has a charming _staccato_ in one bow up as\r\nwell as down, and I never heard such a double shake before. In a word he\r\nis, in my opinion, no juggler, but a very good substantial violinist.\"\r\n\r\nMozart wrote an oboe concerto for the celebrated oboist Gius. Ferlendi,\r\nof Brescia, who was in the Salzburg band in 1775; it does not seem to\r\nhave been preserved. He tells his father (November 4, 1777) that he has\r\nmade a present of it to the oboist Ramm at Mannhein, who was wild with\r\ndelight, and played it five times with the greatest applause. He sent\r\nfrom Vienna for the little book containing the Ferlendi concerto,\r\nfor which Prince Esterhazy had promised him three ducats. Another\r\ncomposition of Mozart's was a concerto for the flute, which, according\r\nto Schiedenhofen, was performed by Cosel in a serenade arranged by\r\nWolfgang for his sister; this may have been the Concerto in G major (313\r\nK.), which evidently belongs to this period. A certain Baron Thad. von\r\nDümitz was an amateur on the bassoon; Mozart composed three concertos\r\nfor him, one in C and two in B flat major (191 K.), short and\r\nunpretentious, as the instrument required; also a duet for bassoon and\r\nvioloncello (292 K.).[55]\r\n\r\nAlthough from his earliest years Mozart had excited lively admiration\r\nby his clavier and organ-playing, it will be better to consider his\r\nperformances on these instruments later on, when we shall have the\r\nassistance of more direct testimony. We know little more of his\r\nstudies[56] than that he practised\r\n\r\n{CLAVIER COMPOSITIONS.}\r\n\r\n(323)\r\n\r\nthe clavier much and diligently, which, indeed, requires no proof.\r\nCompositions by Wagenseil, Paradies, Bach, and Lucchesi are incidentally\r\nmentioned as subjects for home practice.\r\n\r\nThere now remains to consider only the compositions for the clavier, of\r\nwhich there are curiously few known. Some may have been lost, but it\r\nis a fact that after his first childish attempts Mozart composed\r\ncomparatively little for the clavier during his residence in Salzburg.\r\nThere was little opportunity of performing clavier compositions, the\r\ninstrument was not used solo in the court concerts, private concerts\r\nwere not profitable in Salzburg, and in society Mozart generally made\r\nuse of the clavier to improvise or prelude. The lessons which he gave to\r\nladies of rank afforded him an opportunity for composing, but for these\r\npupils he could only write show-pieces.\r\n\r\nTo the earliest authentic clavier compositions belong the variations\r\n(179 K.) on a very popular minuet by the celebrated oboist Fischer,\r\na bravura piece for the time, full of what were then considered\r\ndifficulties.[57]\r\n\r\nHe had them sent to Munich in 1774 in order to make a show with them,\r\nand on the journey to Paris we hear that he had recourse to the Fischer\r\nvariations when he was obliged to play in polite society; proving that\r\nhe was not provided with many compositions of the kind.\r\n\r\nThere were some clavier sonatas written at that time too, which Nannerl\r\nwas instructed to bring to Munich (December 21, 1774), the result being\r\na commission from Baron Dürnitz for six sonatas (279-284 K.); they are\r\noften mentioned by Mozart on the Paris journey of 1777, and he played\r\nthem frequently in Munich, Augsburg and Mannheim with great success.\r\nThey consist, after the old fashion, of three movements; the fourth\r\nforms an exception to the general rule, containing a long adagio, two\r\nminuets (the second instead of a trio), and an allegro; the last is\r\nanother exception, the first allegro being followed by a rondeau en\r\npolonaise--like the violin concerto (218 K.)--ending with variations.\r\nMozart\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(324)\r\n\r\nspoke of sonatas as difficult which are now given as lessons to\r\nbeginners (February 2, 1778). Nevertheless it is no small praise to him\r\nthat, after the lapse of ninety years, the judicious treatment of\r\nthe instrument, the healthy freshness and finished form of these\r\ncompositions entitle them still to be considered as the best foundation\r\nfor a musical education. Any one capable of appreciating a work of\r\nart will find all its essential conditions fulfilled in these simple\r\nsonatas.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart mentions in a letter (December 8, 1777) two four-hand\r\nsonatas, written by Wolfgang for himself and his sister. One may be\r\nthe well-known B flat major sonata (358 K.) which Mozart wrote for from\r\nVienna (June 27, 1781). The form is concise and little elaborated; the\r\nessential condition that each player shall contribute his independent\r\nshare to the general effect is kept duly in view. A second sonata is not\r\nauthenticated.[58]\r\n\r\nA trio for clavier, violin, and violoncello (254 K.), belongs to August,\r\n1776, which, according to Mozart's Munich letters (October 6,1777),\r\nNannerl played at Salzburg with Janitsch and Reicha. It displays, like\r\nall the compositions of this period, completeness and roundness of form\r\nwith maturity and cleverness of conception, and surprises us by its\r\nanimation and the tender beauty of many of its turns of expression. The\r\nclavier is the chief instrument, then the violin, more simply treated,\r\nbut independent. The violoncello does not yet receive full justice; it\r\nis only used as a bass, often effectively, but never overstepping its\r\nnarrow province.\r\n\r\nAfter the (violin?? DW) Concerto in D major (175 K.), composed in\r\nDecember, 1773, and played with applause at Mannheim (February 14,\r\n1778), and, with a new finale, at Vienna (March 22, 1782), Mozart\r\nwrote no clavier music until January, 1776, when he composed a clavier\r\nConcerto in B flat major (238 K.), another in April in C major for the\r\nCountess Lützow (246 K.), and in January, 1777, one in E flat major for\r\nMadame Jenomy (271 K.). This industry\r\n\r\n{CLAVIER CONCERTO (271 K.)}\r\n\r\n(325)\r\n\r\nwas not the result of caprice or chance. Composition went hand in hand\r\nwith his development as a virtuoso, and we can measure his progress\r\nby the increasing difficulty of his works. Unless he was to remain in\r\nSalzburg all his life,[59] a professional tour, to make himself known to\r\nthe world, became more and more a necessity. Both brilliant execution\r\nas a virtuoso and a supply of original compositions would be necessary\r\nconditions for such a tour; Wolfgang's prudent, worldly-wise father took\r\ncare that he should be prepared on all points to insure the success of\r\nthe undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the clavier concertos, which in form and\r\ntreatment resemble the violin concertos, is the last (271 K.), which,\r\nin its freedom of form, breadth of design and passion of expression,\r\napproaches very near to the divertimento in B flat major (287 K.), which\r\nbelongs to the same period. The very beginning is original, the clavier\r\nstriking in with the first bars, and so giving a peculiar tone to the\r\nwhole movement. Not less original is the entrance of the solo passage\r\nproper, the clavier falling in to the last bars of the gradually\r\nexpiring tutti passage, with a shake of several bars length, out of\r\nwhich the subject springs; the same turn is afterwards made use of\r\nat the close of the first movement. The middle movement is called\r\nandantino, but expresses deep and painful emotion, and the cantilene\r\nrepeatedly assumes a recitative-like character (in one beautiful climax\r\nthe violins are in imitation), ending with a perfect recitative.[60] The\r\nlast rondo (presto), a capital exercise for the fingers in its unceasing\r\nrapid movement, has a far more important character than is usual with\r\nconcluding movements. A long cadenza leads back to the subject; the\r\nsecond time, however, it does not lead to the subject, but to a\r\n\r\n{INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.}\r\n\r\n(326)\r\n\r\n\"menuetto cantabile,\" which, kept in check by an orchestral\r\naccompaniment, has more and more the character of a free fantasia, and\r\nat last goes back to the subject in a new cadenza, which leads to a\r\nbrilliant conclusion.\r\n\r\nA concerto for three claviers, written in February, 1776, in F major\r\n(242 K.), displays an increase in solo powers; a title-page, carefully\r\nwritten by the father, announces it as \"Dedicato al incomparabile merito\r\ndi S. Exc. la Sgra. Cont. Lodron, nata Cont. d* Arco et delle sue figlie\r\nle Sgre. Cont. Aloisia et Giuseppa.\" We must not look for the same\r\ncontrapuntal independence of the three instruments which we find in\r\nBach's concertos, but there is no mistaking the cleverness and delicate\r\nsense of effect which are displayed in the varied combinations of the\r\ninstruments--the doubling of parts, the strengthening of the melody or\r\nof the bass, the position of the accompaniment, and the alternation of\r\nthe instruments. The main object of the first movement is to give equal\r\nand yet individual effect to each of the three claviers, although the\r\nthird is hardly on a level with the other two; in the two last movements\r\nthe third instrument is still more in the background, being chiefly\r\nconfined to accompaniment, so that in the finale it does not even take\r\npart in the cadenzas. This made it easier for Mozart to arrange the\r\nconcerto for two instruments; the solo parts, so altered, are preserved\r\nin his handwriting. The tone of the concerto is lively and cheerful; the\r\nwhole is treated in an easy and happy vein of humour, which entertains\r\nthe players quite as much as the audience. Mozart seems to have been\r\nfond of this concerto, and he informs his father with some satisfaction\r\nthat it had been successfully performed both at Augsburg (October 24,\r\n1777), and at Mannheim (March 24, 1778).\r\n\r\nThe orchestra has a perfectly independent part in this composition; but\r\nthere is no very marked distinction between tutti and accompaniment; the\r\norchestra and clavier mutually support and further each other, and their\r\nunion results in a perfect work of art.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to estimate the claims made by Mozart upon the\r\nclavier-player. The principal are simple and tuneful delivery of the\r\nmelody, clearness and precision in the\r\n\r\n{MOZART AS VIRTUOSO.}\r\n\r\n(327)\r\n\r\nembellishments (which were more numerous than at the present day, to\r\nsuit the instrument then in use), skill and steadiness in the running\r\npassages and shakes. Technical difficulties, such as passages in\r\noctaves, thirds, or sixths, occur seldom or never at this period. The\r\nuse of the left hand is also limited; rapidity is only required in\r\naccompaniment passages, and independence in the execution of left-hand\r\nmelodies. What the composer was able to accomplish with the limited\r\nmeans at his command lies clear before us; the life which the virtuoso\r\nthrew into his works by performances full of spirit and genius cannot be\r\nreproduced by any observation of form and mechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Burney cites instances in Milan (I., p. 66), Bologna (I., p. 167),\r\nBrussels (II., p. 43), Vienna (II., p. 239).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Burney, Reise, I., p. 67; II., p. 276.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Burney writes of a church symphony by Galuppi, which he heard\r\nin Venice (I., p. 108): \"In the symphony, which was full of charming\r\npassages, the orchestra imitated an echo.

EARLY MANHOOD.\r\n\r\nOUR examination of the development of Mozart's youthful genius, as it is\r\nto be traced in the multiplicity and variety of his studies, may fitly\r\nbe concluded by a rapid survey of what he had accomplished and the\r\nposition which he held at his entry into manhood.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-one years of age he could hold his own with the first masters\r\nof his time as a performer on the clavier, the organ, and the violin,\r\nand his powers as an executant were far surpassed by his accomplishments\r\nin every branch of composition. Remembering his numerous and successful\r\ncontributions to theatrical music in serious and comic operas, to\r\nchurch music of every kind and description, to instrumental music,\r\nboth concerted and solo, we are amazed at the ease and fertility of\r\nhis producing powers not less than at the steady perseverance and\r\nearnestness of his studies. He never begins at random and breaks off\r\nshort, never yields to chance impulses, to be abandoned before their\r\nobject is attained; his will is always consciously fixed on a definite\r\nend, and to that end he bends all the force and energy of his mind.\r\n\r\nNo small share of the merit of this happy development\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(328)\r\n\r\nmust be accorded to his father, whose careful and well-digested\r\neducational plan, as earnest and conscientious as it was far-seeing\r\nand full of love, counteracted the son's easy and excitable nature, and\r\nconcentrated his whole strength on his artistic cultivation. But the\r\ngreatest share, after all, falls to the admirable organisation of Mozart\r\nhimself. His nature was so genuinely artistic that musical perfection\r\nwas the very germ of that inner being of which his works were the\r\nnatural and inevitable expression.\r\n\r\nThe precocity of his talent, which had produced these works at an age\r\nwhen most minds are only beginning to put their thoughts into articulate\r\nform, had in it nothing forced, strained, or disturbed; he seized\r\ninstinctively on what was in harmony with his genius, absorbed it\r\ncompletely, and made it the stepping-stone to his upward progress.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how he laboured to become absolute master of every kind of\r\nform in his art, and how, step by step, his labours were rewarded. But\r\nno amount of external readiness and skill would satisfy him unless he\r\ncould also give due expression to what moved his innermost soul, and\r\nimpelled him to production. And so it is that even in his earliest works\r\nwe find no opposition between their form and their substance; so it is\r\nthat they are always a _whole_--at first insignificant enough both in\r\nsubstance and treatment, but still a whole--contained in a definite\r\nexpression of artistic form. Looking back at the history of an art\r\nwhich has been begotten and fostered by any nation, we see how it is now\r\nfavoured, now hindered, by external circumstances, how it strives and\r\nstruggles through the long ages, possessing itself here by fits and\r\nstarts, there by easy transitions, of all the means and forms necessary\r\nfor its perfect practice. When at last the spiritual and intellectual\r\nlife of the nation has become free and impelled to artistic activity,\r\nthe great master arises, who, disposing at will of the inheritance of\r\nknowledge and genius bequeathed to him by his fathers, accomplishes the\r\nhighest task of art in his representations of ideal beauty. The glorious\r\ncontemplation of the organic development of a gifted nature, turning all\r\nto good account,\r\n\r\n{FAMILY LIFE IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(329)\r\n\r\nand rejecting what impedes its growth so soon as it has served its turn,\r\nis open for us in Mozart. To him it was given to master the external\r\nconditions of his art on every side without injury to his individuality\r\nand creative force. Artist and man grew together; the deeper the passion\r\nand the more intense the emotion, the more grand and impressive became\r\nthe forms in which they were embodied. And it is in this that consists\r\nthe successful cultivation of any art in youth: in this mastery of the\r\nmeans whereby the man in his maturity makes his genius felt without\r\napparent effort. Whatever study and discipline could attain, Mozart had\r\nattained before he left Salzburg; it was time that he should emerge from\r\nhis narrow surroundings, that he should win freedom and independence,\r\nboth as a man and an artist, by contact with the world.\r\n\r\nThe position held by Mozart at Salzburg, disproportionate alike to his\r\nperformances and their promise, could not but fail to satisfy him as\r\nsoon as he became aware of his own powers.\r\n\r\nHis life would have been simply unendurable had it not been for\r\nthe healthy family life which had been from earliest childhood the\r\nfoundation of his moral and social existence.\r\n\r\nHe grew up in an atmosphere of conjugal and parental affection, of\r\nsincere religion and conscientious morality, and of well-ordered\r\neconomy, which could not fail in its effect on his character. \"After\r\nGod, papa comes,\" was his motto as a boy and as a man; it was the\r\nkeynote of the _whole_ household, and we have seen, and shall see\r\nfurther, how fully Leopold Mozart deserved the trust reposed in him.\r\n\r\nIt was absolute confidence, not timid fear, which bound wife and\r\nchildren to him, and candour and truth ruled all the family intercourse.\r\nNot only the parents and children, but the brother and sister, were\r\ndevoted to each other; the similarity of their talents, far from\r\nexciting emulation or jealousy, only bound them closer together; the\r\nsister witnessed the brilliant successes of her younger brother with\r\npure delight, and bore his teasing with unfailing good-humour, sure,\r\nin her turn, of his ready and hearty sympathy in her joys and sorrows,\r\nwhether great or small. Such a true\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(330)\r\n\r\nfamily life as this, in which the servants[1] and even the pet\r\nanimals[2] had their share, became all the firmer and heartier in\r\nproportion as circumstances narrowed the circle composing it.\r\n\r\nThe primary motive-power was the father's earnest devotion to duty,\r\nand his example gave weight to his unsparing demands on the labour and\r\nindustry of his children. He considered the accomplishments of an\r\nartist as no mere pastime for hours of recreation, no passing breath\r\nof visionary inspiration; but as the ripe food of ceaseless labour,\r\nof untiring progress in moral and artistic self-knowledge. He was not\r\ncontent to recognise in the wonderful receptive and productive powers\r\nof his son a passport to easy indolence, but strove to make him\r\nconsider them as deposits to be turned to the best account by study and\r\ncultivation. He accustomed his children to work from their youth up, and\r\nmade it his first object that their outer circumstances should afford\r\nthem no excuse for idle hours. \"Custom.\" said he, \"is an iron path.\" For\r\nthis reason he gave up every occupation (except the duties demanded\r\nby his official position) which might withdraw him from his children,\r\nespecially all lessons, thereby entailing a considerable pecuniary\r\nsacrifice, for which the profits of his first professional journey could\r\nonly partially compensate. But he had so firm a confidence in Wolfgang's\r\nfuture, and he kept this object so clearly and continually in view, that\r\nnothing could divert him from it. In the boy himself there was no cause\r\nfor anxiety; his trust in his father was unbounded, his nature was\r\npliable, and his zeal for his art so great that it was never necessary\r\nto incite him to industry; indeed, his father often praises his energy\r\nand laboriousness. A further proof of the father's beneficial influence\r\nis the fact that Wolfgang did not yield to the temptation common to\r\ntalented and lively youth in following\r\n\r\n{MOZART'S EDUCATION.}\r\n\r\n(331)\r\n\r\nmomentary and one-sided impulses; but that he advanced step by step in\r\na thorough and judicious cultivation of all his powers. The great number\r\nof his compositions of every kind which we have already noticed gives\r\nus no small idea of his industry; and we must remember that these\r\nperformances were only possible as the result of continuous study and\r\nexercise, of which no outward sign remains. The father insisted on\r\nWolfgang's making clear copies on quarto music paper, both of his own\r\ncompositions and of examples of other composers. A long list of such\r\nexercise-books, in gray-blue covers, with every kind of composition in\r\nMozart's handwriting, arranged and titled by his father, affords the\r\nmost speaking proof of the industry and regard for order and neatness in\r\nwhich Wolfgang was trained.\r\n\r\nAdded to this was the continual hard practice on organ and clavier which\r\nmade him the finished performer he was, then his official duties at\r\ncourt and church, his frequent engagements to play in private circles,\r\nand finally the lessons which he was obliged to give--one wonders in\r\nfact where he found time for it all in a day of only four-and-twenty\r\nhours. Nothing but the anomalous union of extraordinary genius with\r\nregularity and order could have produced so anomalous a result. Then\r\nagain, L. Mozart was too far-seeing and cultivated a man to be satisfied\r\nwith an exclusively musical education for his son. He took care that he\r\nshould attain proficiency in foreign languages; he had learnt Latin\r\nin early youth (p. 61), and some knowledge of it was indispensable for\r\nsacred composition, on which account his father enjoins him (October 15,\r\n1777) always to use a Latin prayer-book. He learnt to speak French and\r\nItalian fluently on his journeys, and his father was careful to keep up\r\nhis knowledge of them. No opportunity was lost of acquiring \"any kind of\r\nuseful knowledge,\" as Leopold writes (December 18, 1777), \"in order to\r\ncultivate the understanding by the reading of good books in different\r\nlanguages.\" Unfortunately we are not told what books Wolfgang read, nor\r\nin what direction his literary taste lay. It is characteristic of the\r\nfather that both the children were obliged every evening to write a\r\nshort account\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(332)\r\n\r\nin a journal of what they had learnt and done throughout the day, in\r\norder to cultivate their observation of themselves and the things around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart knew well that hot-house plants fade quickly, and was careful\r\nnot to overtax the powers of his son, but to preserve him in healthy\r\nfreshness, both of mind and body, by means of due diversion\r\nand recreation. He sought also to render him self-possessed and\r\nunconstrained in his intercourse with all classes of men, which\r\nWolfgang's natural amiability rendered an easy task; it was far more\r\ndifficult to impress him with the necessity for prudence and reserve,\r\nwhich not even the bitter experiences of after-life could teach him.\r\nTied and hampered, as L. Mozart was, in all these endeavours by the\r\nconditions of his life in Salzburg, one support remained of which he\r\ncould not be deprived; this was the beauty of the surrounding scenery.\r\nTrue, he makes no mention of it in his letters, but the dwellers in\r\nbeautiful neighbourhoods seldom express enthusiastic admiration unless\r\nit is called forth by the observation of strangers. Whether consciously\r\nor not, however, the influence of rich and beautiful scenery must be\r\nfelt by a finely organised mind, and the good fortune of a youth passed\r\namid such impressions of surrounding nature is not less to be prized\r\nthan any other happy dispensation which wakens to life the slumbering\r\npowers of the soul.\r\n\r\nIntercourse with cultivated and art-loving men, so indispensable to a\r\nliberal education, was not easy of attainment in Salzburg. Such men were\r\nfew, and almost exclusively belonged to the higher nobility. Two Counts\r\nFirmian, brothers to the Governor-General of Lombardy (p. no), were men\r\nof a lively interest in and appreciation of science and art. While\r\nstill at the university they had founded a literary society which had\r\nconsiderable influence in spite of the strong opposition which its free\r\nscientific tendencies drew upon it.[3] One of the brothers, Vigilius\r\nMaria, who was provost of the cathedral, possessed a carefully selected\r\nlibrary, and was familiar with the literature of all the\r\n\r\n{THE NOBILITY OF SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(333)\r\n\r\nEuropean countries; the other, Franz Lactantius, Lord High Chamberlain\r\nto the Archbishop, was a connoisseur of painting and possessed an\r\nexcellent collection of pictures. But he seems to have had little idea\r\nof music; for although he was extremely well disposed towards Wolfgang,\r\nthe latter writes to his father (July 9, 1778) that nothing can be done\r\nfor music in Salzburg until it is altogether left to the kapellmeister,\r\nso that the Lord High Chamberlain may have no power to interfere: \"for\r\nyou cannot make a kapellmeister out of a cavalier, although you may make\r\na cavalier out of a kapellmeister.\" Canon Count Anton Wilibald Wolfegg\r\nhad travelled extensively in order to make himself acquainted with\r\nmanufactures and industries, and had specially studied architecture. The\r\nMaster of the Horse, Count Leopold Joseph Küenberg, was a well-read and\r\naccomplished man; the Bishop of Chiemsee, Count Ferdinand von Zeil,\r\nwas as distinguished for intellect and cultivation as for nobility of\r\ndisposition.[4] We may gather that all these men were well disposed\r\ntowards Mozart. The Chamberlain, Count George Anton Felix von Arco, the\r\nCourt Marshal, Count Nicolaus Sebastian von Lodron, and the Captain of\r\nthe Body-Guard, Count Leopold von Lodron, were also among his patrons.\r\nHe had free entry into their houses, played at their entertainments, and\r\ngave lessons to their daughters, all the ladies, old and young, vying\r\nwith each other in attentions to the distinguished virtuoso. Wolfgang\r\nsends a respectful kiss of the hand from Milan (February 17, 1770) to\r\nher Excellency Countess Arco, and thanks her for the kiss she had sent\r\nhim, which he prized more highly than many a salute from a younger\r\nperson. Differences of rank, however, and of personal circumstances\r\nrendered difficult any such friendly intercourse as would have been of\r\nadvantage to Mozart both socially and professionally.\r\n\r\nThe circle was not an artistic one. Wolfgang praises Count Salem in\r\nMunich (October 2, 1777), and calls him a\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(334)\r\n\r\ntrue connoisseur. \"He says 'Bravo!' when the other cavaliers take a\r\npinch of snuff, or blow their noses, or cough, or begin a conversation.\"\r\n\r\nThe smaller or, as it was called, the \"wilde\" nobility lived for the\r\nmost part on the numerous smaller court offices, the incomes of which\r\ndid not enable them to make a show in proportion to their rank; they\r\nstrove to indemnify themselves by pride and haughtiness, although there\r\nwere some few cultivated families among them.[5] With some of these, and\r\nmore particularly with their younger members, we find Wolfgang in close\r\nintercourse, but the friendship was in most instances a superficial one,\r\nwhich did not stand the test of years and absence. Herr von Mölk, son\r\nof the Court Chancellor, is mentioned as a friend of Wolfgang's, and an\r\nunsuccessful suitor of his sister Marianne; it was he who was so amazed\r\nand delighted with the performance of the opera at Munich that the\r\nMozarts were ashamed of him, because it was evident that he had seen\r\nnothing all his life but Salzburg and Innspruck.[6] Mozart was more\r\nattached, at least in his early years, to Fräulein W. von Mölk, to whom\r\nhe sends a message that he would like the same reward from her that he\r\nhad for the last minuets; she knows what that is. That his heart\r\nwas somewhat susceptible of impression in youth is evident from the\r\nmysterious allusions which Wolfgang makes in his letters to his sister;\r\nshe is to visit--she knows whom--to give tender messages, &c. When he\r\nwent to Italy in 1772, an expression in a letter from his father points\r\nto a daughter of Dr. Barisani as his reigning goddess. Other friends of\r\nMozart's youth were Herr von Hefner, son of the town syndic; Herr von\r\nAman, of whom he was very fond as a boy, though the intimacy afterwards\r\ndied out, and Joachim von Schiedenhofen, who disgusted Mozart by\r\nmarrying for money. Von Schiedenhofen kept in his youth a \"diary of his\r\nown doings,\" extracts from which, relating to the years 1774-1777, take\r\nnote of all the visits of\r\n\r\n{SOCIETY IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(335)\r\n\r\nthe Mozart family. These extracts prove that the Mozarts were on\r\nfriendly terms with many other court officials. They visited each other\r\nin the afternoons and evenings, and either played cards or had\r\nmusic. Regular entertainments are mentioned, such as meetings for the\r\nbolt-shooting which we shall presently describe, and a card club; the\r\nfriends also went to concerts and masquerades together.\r\n\r\nIntercourse with families of the citizen class, which could not fail to\r\nresult from the position held by the Mozarts, and from their many years\r\nresidence in the place, was more of a recreation for idle hours than\r\na means of intellectual improvement; occasional allusions to Salzburg\r\nsociety are not of a favourable nature.[7] Among their intimate friends\r\nwas our old acquaintance Hagenauer, a merchant, and for many years their\r\nlandlord. We may gather from the confidential letters addressed to\r\nhim by L. Mozart on the first journey that he was not only sincerely\r\nattached to them and always ready with advice and help, but that he had\r\ncultivation and tastes in advance of his surroundings. His wife,\r\njudging from some remarks of L. Mozart, was somewhat bigoted and fond\r\nof priestly intercourse. The closest friend of the family, however,\r\nwho possessed the confidence both of father and children, was Jos.\r\nBullinger, a priest, who had been educated at the Jesuit seminary in\r\nMunich and was tutor in the family of Count Arco at Salzburg. \"The\r\nfaithful Bullinger\" was \"always a chief person\" in the Mozarts' house;\r\nin Wolfgang's letters home he not only always sends messages to his\r\n\"good friend Bullinger,\" but he begs that his letters may be read to\r\nhim, and sometimes that important secrets may be told to no one but\r\nNannerl and Bullinger. After the mother's death in Paris, Wolfgang\r\nintrusted him with the mournful task of breaking the news gently to his\r\nfather, which Bullinger did\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(336)\r\n\r\nwith equal tact and sympathy; and when Wolfgang was forced, much against\r\nhis will, to return to Salzburg, it was to his friend Bullinger that he\r\npoured out his heavy laden heart (August 7, 1778). And the attachment\r\nwas mutual. When Wolfgang was on his way home from Paris, and his father\r\nand sister, anxious for news of him, confessed and communicated with\r\nmany prayers for the preservation of their dear one, \"the faithful\r\nBullinger\" also \"prayed for him daily in the holy mass\" (October 19,\r\n1778). The father, too, had good cause to declare that Bullinger was\r\nhis best and truest friend, from whom he had received \"much courtesy\r\nand kindness,\" and who, when he was in embarrassment during Wolfgang's\r\njourney, assisted him by a considerable loan.\r\n\r\nHe placed the fullest confidence in Bullinger, shared with him all his\r\nplans for Wolfgang, and took counsel with him on many occasions. The\r\nfriendship between them was well known in Salzburg; and in the efforts\r\nthat were made to recall Wolfgang from Vienna Bullinger was employed as\r\na go-between. He seems to have had some taste for music; at least, we\r\nhear of his taking part in some private concerts, which were held every\r\nSunday at eleven o'clock; and Wolfgang writes, after his departure\r\n(October 11, 1777), begging him to \"hold an official discourse, and give\r\nhis compliments to all the members of the Academy.\"\r\n\r\nOpportunities for social gaiety were more freely afforded to\r\npleasure-loving Salzburg under Archbishop Hieronymus than under his\r\npredecessor Sigismund, whose tastes were not nearly so cheerful nor so\r\nliberal.[8] Salzburg society was characterised as follows: \"The country\r\ngentlemen hunt and go to church; those next below them go to church and\r\nhunt; the next lower rank eat, drink, and pray; and the lowest of all\r\npray, drink, and eat. The two latter classes conduct their love affairs\r\nin public, and the two former in private; all alike live in sensual\r\nindulgence.\"\r\n\r\n{AMUSEMENTS IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(337)\r\n\r\nIn 1775 a spacious hall, with some side apartments, were added to the\r\ntown hall, and there, during the carnival, masked balls were given\r\nunder the supervision of the magistrate, as well as concerts and other\r\nentertainments. Mozart, who was fond of dancing and jokes, excelled in\r\nmasquerading; Schiedenhofen mentions his having amused every one as a\r\npeasant bridegroom, and another time as a young dandy.\r\n\r\nBut even in Salzburg the most popular entertainment was the play; a\r\ntheatre was built expressly for the court on the right bank of the\r\nSalzach, and there in winter performances were given by the Munich or\r\nsome other travelling company,[9] sledge parties and others being formed\r\nfor the purpose of attending. In summer, excursions were made to the\r\nnumerous objects of interest in the neighbourhood, a very favourite\r\none being to the royal park of Hellbronn.[10] The Mozarts rarely\r\nparticipated in these pleasures.\r\n\r\nAlthough the father was able to write to his son (February 12,1778):\r\n\"Consider whether I have not always helped you to procure every possible\r\npleasure that was harmless and sensible, often at the cost of great\r\npersonal inconvenience,\" yet his limited circumstances prohibited any\r\nvery frequent indulgence in such pleasures.\r\n\r\nThe increasing expenses, which he justly ascribed to the parsimonious\r\nsystem of the government,[11] necessitated the strictest economy on his\r\npart. He laid these circumstances clearly before his son (February 16,\r\n1778):--\r\n\r\nIt has been very hard work for me ever since your birth, and even\r\nbefore, to support a wife and seven children, besides your grandmother\r\nand several others, on twenty florins a month, taking into account\r\nchild-births, deaths, and illnesses. If you calculate these expenses you\r\nwill readily believe that not only have I never had a kreutzer to spend\r\non my own pleasure, but that it has only been by the grace of God and\r\nhard work that I have kept free from debt. I have sacrificed my whole\r\ntime to you two children in order that when the time came you might be\r\nable\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(338)\r\n\r\nboth to maintain yourselves, and also provide me with the means of\r\nspending a peaceful old age, occupied only with thoughts for the safety\r\nof my soul, and preparations for a happy death.\"\r\n\r\nBut L. Mozart's economy was judicious. \"Buy nothing that is bad,\" he\r\nwrote to his wife (October 26, 1771), \"there is no saving in buying bad\r\nthings.\" The simplicity of the manners of the household, and the modest\r\nnature of the enjoyments, may be proved by the extreme and constant\r\npopularity among the whole circle of a game called \"bolt-shooting\"\r\n(bölzelschiessen). A number of intimates formed themselves into a sort\r\nof little guild, and met every Sunday at the various houses of the\r\nmembers. Each player in turn threw a bolt or quoit, and numerous were\r\nthe jokes to which the game gave rise. A sort of rivalry grew up in the\r\nfurnishing of each quoit with inscriptions bearing on the foibles and\r\npeculiarities of the different players, and the tendency to joking and\r\nsarcasm of the good Salzburgers was thereby encouraged and indulged.\r\nA pleasant sociable kind of intercourse grew out of these constant\r\nmeetings. The following instance will show the kind of pleasantry that\r\nwas allowable on such occasions. Leopold tells his son (November 11,\r\n1780) how one of the lady members, who was a little bit of a coquette,\r\nhappened one day to trip on the step of a shop she was entering in\r\nfull daylight, and to fall in a very inelegant posture. This was duly\r\nportrayed with appropriate verses on the quoit, to the uncontrollable\r\nmerriment of the whole party. The bolt-shooting is never forgotten\r\nin the family correspondence; amusing quoit pictures are forwarded\r\nto absent members, and their share of the winnings received by their\r\nproxies. Mozart writes to his sister from Vienna (July 4, 1781) : \"Is it\r\nnot about time for the shooting supper? Pray do not forget to drink the\r\nhealth of a faithful shooter with due honours, and tell me when it comes\r\nto my turn, that I may paint a quoit.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the encouragement which Wolfgang needed\r\nto render his arduous labours pleasant and satisfactory could only be\r\nlooked for from the sympathy of his colleagues, and the favour with\r\nwhich his performances were received. But, unfavourable as the state of\r\nthings\r\n\r\n{INTERCOURSE WITH FELLOW-MUSICIANS.}\r\n\r\n(339)\r\n\r\nwas in Salzburg in other respects, on this point it was simply\r\nintolerable. Individual musicians, such as the faithful Schachtner,\r\nwho were free from envy, and had cultivation and industry enough to\r\nappreciate intercourse with the Mozart family, formed a close and\r\nconstant friendship with them. But, with the majority, intimacy was on\r\nmany accounts out of the question, even when, as in the case of Michael\r\nHaydn and Adlgasser, they deserved all recognition as artists.[12] It\r\nwas in contrast to Salzburg that L. Mozart praises the orchestra at\r\nMannheim as \"young men of good morals, neither tipplers nor gamblers,\r\nnor miserable blockheads, whose conduct and performances are alike\r\nadmirable\" (July 19, 1763). Wolfgang made similar observations in after\r\nyears, and wrote to his father from Paris (July 9,1778) how businesslike\r\neverything was under Cannabich's conductorship, how implicitly he was\r\nobeyed, and what much better lives the musicians lived there than\r\nat Salzburg. \"One of my chief reasons for detesting Salzburg is the\r\nimpossibility of associating, as an honest man, with the coarse, stupid,\r\ndissolute musicians belonging to the court; one is quite ashamed of\r\nthem, and it is they who bring music generally into disfavour.\" We can\r\nwell understand how frequently the Mozart family would give offence to\r\nmen of small cultivation and ill-regulated tastes. As a childish prodigy\r\nMozart had amused them by his childlike candour and engaging confidence;\r\nbut as a growing youth his performances became an intolerable source of\r\nannoyance and envy to them, not lessened by the brilliant recognition\r\nwhich he met with outside the walls of his native town. Their ill-will\r\nwas doubtless also increased by the reserve of the Mozarts, their claims\r\nto superior cultivation, and the justification sometimes accorded\r\nto these claims; and although the father's prudence and the mother's\r\ngood nature would prevent any open rupture with their colleagues, yet\r\na tendency to severe criticism, sometimes jokingly, sometimes\r\nsarcastically expressed, is common to all the Mozarts. If we may judge\r\nof the tone of their actual\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(340)\r\n\r\nintercourse by the numerous allusions in their letters (and Wolfgang's\r\nforte was certainly not prudent reserve), then, indeed, Salzburg might\r\nwell dread the sharpness of the Mozart tongue.\r\n\r\nThe family were on least friendly terms with the Italians attached to\r\nthe service of the Archbishop. Almost everywhere in Germany the idea was\r\nfirmly rooted that the reputation of the musical establishments could\r\nonly be upheld by summoning composers and virtuosi from Italy. When\r\nWolfgang wrote to his father from Munich (September 29, 1777): \"So\r\nit is! All the great people have a rage for foreigners!\" His father\r\nconsoled him by answering (October 4,1777): \"The rage for Italians\r\nis almost confined to Munich; it exists in an exaggerated degree. In\r\nMannheim, everything is German, except a couple of male sopranos. At\r\nTrêves, under the Elector, Prince Clement of Saxony, the Maestro alone\r\nis Italian; Mayence is altogether German; and at Würzburg the\r\nonly foreigner is Signor Fracassini, a violinist, now, I believe,\r\nkapellmeister, and that only for the sake of his German wife, a vocalist\r\nand a native of Würzburg. There are no foreigners at any of the smaller\r\nProtestant courts.\" Notwithstanding, however, the reduction of the\r\noperatic and court establishment of Stuttgart in 1768, by the dismissal\r\nof some of its chief members, the taste and feeling, as well as the\r\nmajority of the _personnel_, continued to be purely Italian;[13] and\r\nat Bonn many Italians belonged to the court establishment, under the\r\nleadership of Lucchesi.[14] L. Mozart does not allude to North Germany,\r\nsince it lay out of Wolfgang's projected path. The natural consequence\r\nof the intrusion of foreigners was ceaseless contention between the\r\nGerman musicians, who saw themselves slighted and aggrieved, and the\r\nItalians, who made their superiority most offensively felt.[15] Mozart\r\nhad to suffer from foreign intrigues\r\n\r\n{ITALIANS IN SALZBURG.}\r\n\r\n(341)\r\n\r\nnot only in Milan while composing his opera (p. 130), but perhaps also\r\nin Munich, and certainly in Salzburg. Archbishop Hieronymus, who set\r\na low value on anything belonging to Salzburg, although he paid a\r\nhigh price for many a native manufacture bearing a foreign stamp,[16]\r\nintroduced Italians into his band, because it had been blamed as \"rough\r\nand rapid in execution, and not delicate nor in the best taste.\"[17] The\r\nkapellmeister Lolli, having become old and incapable, was replaced by\r\nFischietti in 1772; this was a disappointment to L. Mozart, whose claims\r\nto the office were well founded, since he was considered to have placed\r\nmusic on its then excellent footing.[18] Among the soloists Brunetti\r\nwas appointed to the violin, Ferrari to the violoncello, Ferlendi to\r\nthe oboe, and Ceccarelli was male soprano. These Italians were not only\r\nbetter paid than native artists, but the \"foreign asses,\" as Michael\r\nHaydn called them, relying on the favour of the Archbishop, conducted\r\nthemselves with insolence and ill-breeding.[19] There can be no question\r\nthat the annoyance to the two Mozarts was great at seeing strangers, far\r\nbelow them in social position and talent, preferred before them, while\r\nall the hard labour devolved upon themselves. Fischietti's compositions\r\nwere few and far between; Wolfgang was always ready to compose operatic\r\nor sacred, vocal or instrumental music, as occasion arose. All this\r\nimplanted a rooted dislike to foreigners in Mozart's young mind which\r\nthe experiences of his later years did much to confirm. But the artistic\r\nelement of his nature was far too strong and too pure to allow personal\r\nconsideration to influence his judgment on Italian music; his heart was\r\nso sound and good that he\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(342)\r\n\r\ncould overcome his dislike to the nation in his intercourse with\r\nindividuals: it only transpires every now and then.\r\n\r\nIt was not very likely that the Mozarts--father or son--would be in high\r\nfavour at court. We do not know much of their dealings with Archbishop\r\nSigismund; but the difficulty L. Mozart had in renewing his leave of\r\nabsence proves that the Archbishop was not overpleased with his repeated\r\nand lengthened stays abroad.[20] Wolfgang received an official post and\r\nthe title of Concertmeister some time before 1770, but no salary; and\r\neven after the production of \"Ascanio in Alba\" L. Mozart was in doubt as\r\nto whether the Archbishop would remember his son if any vacancy occurred\r\n(p. 134). It is not known whether the salary of 150 gulden a year which\r\nhe drew as Concertmeister had been granted to him by Sigismund; in any\r\ncase it was not raised until 1777 by his successor, whose own sister,\r\nthe Countess Schönborn, as Wolfgang writes (September 26, 1777),\r\n\"positively refused to believe that he had had a monthly keepsake of\r\ntwelve florins thirty kreutzers.\"\r\n\r\nMozart's position was still more unfavourable under Hieronymus, who\r\nnever forgave the inhabitants of Salzburg their strongly expressed\r\nopposition to his election as Archbishop.[21] He knew himself to be\r\nunpopular, and, instead of courting popularity, openly displayed his\r\ncontempt for his subjects.[22] He was a man of acute and enlightened\r\nintellect, and carried out some important reforms in his government\r\n\r\n{ARCHBISHOP HIERONYMUS.}\r\n\r\n(343)\r\n\r\nwith a firm hand; but he was self-willed, parsimonious, and\r\nunscrupulous.[23] He seldom expressed satisfaction with his officials.\r\nHis disdainful mode of address to all but those of the highest nobility,\r\nand the irritable tone of his conversation, kept all about him in timid\r\nsubordination. Even his appearance (although he was of mean stature\r\nand sickly complexion)--the sharp glance of his grey eyes, the left\r\neye rarely fully open, and the decided lines round his mouth--commanded\r\nrespect and fear.[24] There were other circumstances besides their\r\nGerman extraction and Salzburg birth which rendered the two Mozarts\r\nobnoxious to the Archbishop. Count Ferdinand von Zeil, afterwards\r\nBishop of Chiemsee, to whose generous withdrawal Hieronymus owed his\r\nelection,[25] was one of Mozart's warmest and most constant supporters,\r\nand for him Mozart, like all Salzburg, felt the deepest love and\r\nrespect. This was not the way to the favour of Hieronymus. L. Mozart's\r\nindependent demeanour, doing his duty and going his way without\r\nobsequiousness or flattery, and Wolfgang's open-mouthed candour, causing\r\nhim occasionally to forget his official position and the reserve it\r\nshould have entailed, were so many reasons for additional tyranny on the\r\npart of the Archbishop. Added to this was the fact that Mozart, with his\r\nslender figure and boyish countenance, made a poor personal impression\r\non Hieronymus, who was singularly apt to be imposed upon by men of\r\ncommanding height and appearance.[26] He refused any recognition of\r\nWolfgang's musical accomplishments, and was unsparing in his criticism\r\nof them,[27] telling him--as\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(344)\r\n\r\nLeopold wrote to Padre Martini (December 22, 1777)--that he knew nothing\r\nof his art, and should go and study at the Naples Conservatoire that\r\nhe might learn something; a sufficiently unreasonable proposal to an\r\nacademician of Bologna and Verona--to a young man who had traversed\r\nItaly in triumph as a composer and virtuoso. True, Mozart had no great\r\nrespect for the Archbishop's critical judgment, but in the mouth of\r\nhis Prince such an expression of opinion was of very unpleasant\r\nsignificance; for, in point of fact, Hieronymus was well aware of\r\nMozart's genius, and never failed to honour him with commissions when\r\nany new composition was required, for which he never paid him a penny.\r\nEven if otherwise, those around him would have put him right on the\r\npoint; it was of set purpose that he gave vent to these insults. He\r\nimagined that contemptuous expressions of opinion as to his\r\nperformances would be the most effectual means of preventing the younger\r\nConcertmeister from preferring his claim to a higher salary than 150\r\ngulden a year.\r\n\r\nSuch were the continual insults and opposition borne by the father and\r\nson, each on behalf of the other. \"I hope\" wrote Wolfgang, \"that you are\r\nless annoyed than when I was in Salzburg, for I must acknowledge that\r\nI was the cause of it. I was badly treated; I did not deserve it. You\r\nnaturally took my part, but too strongly; I assure you that was the\r\nchief reason that I hurried out of Salzburg.\" To this his father answers\r\n(November 17, 1777): \"You are quite right as to my extreme annoyance\r\nat the tyrannical treatment you received; it gnawed at my heart, and\r\nprevented my sleeping; it was always in my thoughts, and would in the\r\nend have destroyed me. My dear son, when you are happy, I am happy; and\r\nyour mother and sister--we are all happy; and this happiness I hope for,\r\nby the grace of God and my confidence in your own good sense.\" L. Mozart\r\nsaw from the beginning that Wolfgang would never fill a position worthy\r\nof him in Salzburg; and he exerted himself in vain to procure a post for\r\nhim at some other court. The greatest caution was necessary to keep his\r\nnegotiations a secret at Salzburg; for his\r\n\r\n{PLANS FOR MOZART'S FUTURE.}\r\n\r\n(345)\r\n\r\nenemies would not fail to seize the opportunity of injuring him, perhaps\r\nof displacing him altogether. Aware of the folly of endangering his\r\nassured position, uncomfortable though it might be, he strove to allay\r\nthe growing impatience of his son. The latter desired that the whole\r\nfamily should gain their livelihood by a grand professional tour, until\r\nthey could find a secure and happier position in some place or other.\r\nHis father, wiser and more experienced, pointed out to him (December 18,\r\n1777) how entirely their circumstances had altered since his childhood,\r\nhow hard it would be to gain subsistence for a whole family journeying\r\nabout, how uncertain their means of maintenance would be; Leopold duly\r\nappreciated also the cares and dangers of a nomadic life. Nor was\r\nhe more inclined to trust his son entirely alone. He knew Wolfgang's\r\nincapacity in all the concerns of practical life, particularly in\r\ntravelling, since he \"did not know the differences of coinage, and\r\nhad no conception of packing up, or anything of that sort.\" He saw the\r\nhindrances which envy and mistrust would be sure to lay in the path of a\r\nyoung man who was striving to win his way by surpassing talent and great\r\ndoings. Above all, he feared the temperament of his son, knowing that\r\nhis careless frankness and good nature, coupled with his excitability\r\nand proneness to hasty rejoinder, would make him the easy prey of any\r\none who might wish to use or to injure him. He addresses Wolfgang in\r\nwords of warning (February 16, 1778):--\r\n\r\nMy dear Son,--You are too hot and hasty in all your affairs. Your\r\ncharacter has entirely changed since your childhood and boyhood. You\r\nwere grave and earnest as a child; and when you were busy over your\r\nmusic, no one might venture the least jesting with you. Even your\r\ncountenance was so grave that many people in different countries\r\nbelieved that your precocious talent and serious face betokened an early\r\ndeath. Now, on the contrary, it appears to me that you are far too ready\r\nto answer jestingly on every occasion, which is the first step to a kind\r\nof familiarity which one should eschew if one desires to win respect in\r\nthe world. It is your good heart which causes you to see no fault in a\r\nman, to give him your full confidence, provided he only extols you to\r\nthe skies; whereas, as a boy, your excess of modesty made you cry when\r\npeople praised you too much.\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(346)\r\n\r\nL. Mozart knew also that Wolfgang would be so engrossed in his art as\r\nto forget everything else, more especially whatever would be to his\r\nown advantage. He trembled for the dangers which would beset the\r\ninexperienced youth, leaving the narrow sphere of provincial life to\r\nencounter the temptations of the great world. He strove with all his\r\nmight, therefore, to instil patience into his son, and represented to\r\nhim that his probation in Salzburg was a necessary preparation for\r\nthe tour, which would have far more certainty of success when he was\r\nsomewhat maturer in age and education.\r\n\r\nBut even this patience had its limits. Wolfgang had not left Salzburg\r\nsince he had produced the \"Finta Giardiniera\" at Munich, in 1775; if\r\nhe did not wish to be altogether forgotten, he must again display his\r\npowers as a composer and executant. He had prepared himself for such\r\na tour as he proposed by prolonged study and solo compositions. The\r\nnumerous fair copies in the little books we have named had been made\r\nwith the same object in view; they could be readily packed, and always\r\nat hand for performance, or to be copied again as presents. When\r\neverything was ready, the father and son applied to the Archbishop for\r\npermission to travel; this, as well as a petition for an increase of\r\nsalary, was roundly refused; the Archbishop giving as his reason that he\r\nwould not have his subjects \"going on begging expeditions.\"\r\n\r\nBut the cup was now full to overflowing; Wolfgang begged leave to resign\r\nhis post at Salzburg, and the Archbishop, enraged at having the tables\r\nturned upon him, accepted the resignation in the most ungracious manner.\r\nIt was even expected that his anger would extend to the father, and\r\nthat he had given orders to strike L. Mozart's name off the list of his\r\nmusicians. This, however, was not the case; with an ungracious remark\r\nthe Archbishop allowed him to retain his place.\r\n\r\nWolfgang's resignation excited much notice in Salzburg; and the\r\nuniversal regret was shared even by those immediately round the\r\nArchbishop. Count von Firmian, who was extremely fond of Wolfgang, was\r\nrejoicing on his return from a journey (as L. Mozart relates, October 4,\r\n1777) in\r\n\r\n{RESIGNATION OF SERVICE AT COURT.}\r\n\r\n(347)\r\n\r\nthe pleasure that a riding-horse he had purchased for him would give his\r\nyoung friend, when he was met by the lamentable intelligence. When he\r\npaid his respects to the Archbishop, the latter remarked: \"We have one\r\nmusician less since you left.\" He answered, \"Your Grace has lost a great\r\nperformer.\" \"How so?\" \"He is the greatest clavier-player that I ever\r\nheard in my life; he has done your grace good service on the violin, and\r\nhe is a first-rate composer.\" Whereupon the Archbishop was silent. Canon\r\nCount Jos. Starhemberg too, declared later (June 29, 1778) that Mozart's\r\ncomplaints were fully justified, and that all visitors to Salzburg had\r\nadmired young Mozart, by whom he himself was quite captivated.\r\n\r\nBut this turn of affairs gave L. Mozart the deepest anxiety; all\r\nthe difficulties and objections to the journey pressed upon him with\r\nredoubled force now that it was to be undertaken under such unfavourable\r\ncircumstances. It was, however, rendered inevitable. It would be\r\nincompatible with pride or self-respect to purchase Wolfgang's\r\ncontinuance in his office at the cost of abject submission to the\r\nArchbishop. It only remained, by energy and foresight, so to make use\r\nof circumstances as to preserve their honour with the Archbishop, and to\r\ninsure a fixed position for Wolfgang. The visits must be arranged to the\r\nlarger towns, especially residences, where concerts might cover the cost\r\nof the journey, and commissions for compositions might render possible a\r\nlengthened stay, ending, perhaps, in a settled engagement. The tour\r\nwas planned with these ends in view, and Leopold was never weary of\r\nimpressing upon his son that his sole endeavour must be to win a name,\r\nto make money, and to obtain a position; personal gratification and mere\r\namusement must be kept altogether in the background. \"Money-making,\" he\r\nwrites (October 15, 1777), \"must engross all your attention, and economy\r\nmust be all your care, otherwise a journey is of no profit; on the\r\ncontrary, it brings a man into debt.\" And again (November 27, 1777):\r\n\"The object of the journey is, was, and must be the acquirement of a\r\nfixed position and the making of money.\" His extensive connections and\r\ngreat local knowledge enabled him to trace his\r\n\r\n{EARLY MANHOOD.}\r\n\r\n(348)\r\n\r\nson's path out, and to gain him excellent introductions, and his\r\nzeal and activity were indefatigable. Wolfgang was enjoined to become\r\nacquainted with persons and events, to grasp quickly his probable\r\nprospects in any place, and either at once to turn them to good account,\r\nor if unfavourable, to leave the place. But Wolfgang had neither the\r\nexperience nor the practical shrewdness of his father; he felt secure\r\nof his art, in which alone he lived, and imagined the rest would come\r\nof itse(l)f. The prospect of at last escaping from detested Salzburg was\r\napparently too engrossing to allow him to pay much heed to his father's\r\nwarnings. The father knew all this, and knew that he must not go alone;\r\nhe could not accompany him himself, and he therefore took the hard\r\nresolve of parting with his wife and sending her forth with their son.\r\n\r\nHe was quite aware that, as a woman, she could not occupy the same\r\nposition towards Wolfgang as he himself; and he must have felt, too,\r\nthat intense as her love for Wolfgang was, she had not the energy or\r\nsuperiority of intellect necessary to guide him. But she knew the world,\r\nand was an experienced traveller, and so he hoped that she would supply\r\nthe carefulness and economy which Wolfgang lacked; she was specially\r\nenjoined to keep an exact account, and at once to inform her husband of\r\nany propositions that were made, that he might advise and direct. She\r\ndoes not seem, however, to have quite answered his expectations, partly\r\nbecause she could not always withstand her son's impatient restlessness,\r\nand partly because she yielded to her own inclinations, although she\r\noften declared \"she was ready to drop with the fatigue of packing-up.\"\r\nBut Leopold could rely on her influence on the most important point of\r\nall. The mother's presence was a guarantee that her tenderly reared\r\nand devoted son would be careful of his health. He hoped, too, that her\r\npresence would preserve him from any dangerous or immoral intercourse,\r\non which point he gives Wolfgang the benefit of his own experience\r\n(February 16, 1778):--\r\n\r\nI sought only the acquaintance and friendship of persons of the higher\r\nclasses, and even among them I avoided idle young fellows, whatever\r\ntheir rank. I invited no one to visit me frequently, and always\r\npreferred visiting others when I pleased. For if I do not care for a\r\nman, or am\r\n\r\n{PREPARATIONS FOR TRAVELLING.}\r\n\r\n(349)\r\n\r\nbusy or engaged, I can stay away; but if he comes to me, I am at a loss\r\nto get rid of him; and, even if a pleasant visitor, he may hinder me\r\nat my work. You are a young man of twenty-two, so that it is not the\r\ngravity of your years which will prevent worthless fellows, old or\r\nyoung, from making your acquaintance and endeavouring to entice you to\r\nfollow their example. One is led on irresistibly, and finds, when too\r\nlate, that there is no return.\r\n\r\nI will not enter on the subject of women, wherein nature herself is our\r\nenemy, and he who does not strenuously resist at first will strive in\r\nvain to escape from the labyrinth, and will find no release but death.\r\nHow blindly one is often led on by jokes, flattery, &c., until returning\r\nsense awakens one to shame, you may have, perhaps, already experienced\r\nin some degree. I do not mean to reproach you. I know that you love me\r\nnot as your father alone, but as your closest and surest friend.\r\n\r\nSeparation from his wife was not the only sacrifice made by the father\r\nto the well-being of his son. He foresaw that the profits of the journey\r\nwould hardly cover its expenses, and that he must arrange to have a sum\r\nalways in hand in case of emergencies. He had no private property; the\r\nprofits of the first journey had already disappeared; he was obliged\r\nto borrow, and debt was abhorrent to so conscientious a man; but his\r\nfriends Hagenauer and Bullinger readily came to his assistance. He not\r\nonly cut down to their lowest point the expenses of his housekeeping\r\nwith Nannerl, but he undertook once more \"the very uncongenial work of\r\ngiving lessons,\" badly paid and fatiguing as it was. A father who made\r\nsuch sacrifices for his son had a right to demand in return, not indeed\r\nfilial love, and the gaining of artistic fame--that came freely and\r\nspontaneously--but a degree of prudence and forethought which should\r\nsuffice for the demands of practical life. \"I have, my dear Wolfgang,\"\r\nhe says (February 16, 1778), \"not only not the smallest mistrust in you,\r\nbut I place all confidence and all hope in your future. It all depends\r\non the sound good sense which you certainly possess, if you would only\r\npay heed to it, and on fortunate circumstances. These last are not to be\r\nforced, but you can always take sense to your counsel, and that I hope\r\nand pray you will.\"\r\n\r\nThus was everything planned and prepared, the necessary means were\r\nprovided, the outfit purchased, and a carriage\r\n\r\n{MUNICH AND AUGSBURG.}\r\n\r\n(350)\r\n\r\nin readiness which would contain the two travellers and their luggage,\r\nclothes, and instruments. This was the approved method of travelling at\r\nthat time, and Leopold Mozart was determined to send his son forth into\r\nthe world, not as an itinerant musician, but as an artist commanding\r\nrespect and honourable treatment, even from his outward surroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Messages and birthday congratulations to the servant-maids were\r\nnever forgotten in his letters home.

MUNICH AND AUGSBURG.\r\n\r\nEARLY on the morning of September 23,1777, Wolfgang and his mother took\r\ntheir departure from Salzburg, leaving L. Mozart far from well, and\r\ninconsolable in his solitude.\r\n\r\n\"After you had set off,\" he wrote (September 25, 1777), \"I went upstairs\r\nquite exhausted, and threw myself on a couch. It was with a great effort\r\nthat I had restrained myself at parting, in order not to add to our\r\ngrief, and in the confusion I had forgotten to give my son the paternal\r\nblessing. I ran to the window and sent it after you both; but as I did\r\nnot see you drive through the gate, I came to the conclusion that you\r\nhad already passed, and that I had sat immersed in my grief longer than\r\nI supposed.\" Nannerl wept till she made herself ill, and did not recover\r\ntill the evening, when the two consoled themselves with a game of\r\npiquet.\r\n\r\nWolfgang, on the contrary, breathed more freely as soon as he had\r\nturned his back upon Salzburg; the feeling of relief from the galling\r\noppression of years dispelled the sorrow of parting with his father\r\nand sister. In his former journeys he had experienced nothing but\r\nencouragement and success, and had been shielded from all the harassing\r\ncares of ordinary life; and so he took his way with artless confidence\r\ninto the wide world. He little dreamt that he had in fact made the\r\nfirst step along a thorny path, to be met from henceforth to the end by\r\ndifficulty, opposition, pain, and sorrow.\r\n\r\n{MUNICH, 1777.}\r\n\r\n(351)\r\n\r\nHis mind was fresh and youthful enough to be diverted by all the little\r\nincidents of such a journey. When he sat down in the evening, \"_undecima\r\nhora noctis_,\" at Wasserburg, to acquaint his father of their safe\r\narrival, he could think of nothing more important to tell him than of\r\ntheir having seen a cow \"all on one side.\" He had met a fat gentleman\r\nwho remembered having seen Wolfgang a year ago during a performance of\r\n\"Mirabell\"; he was in company with Herr von Unhold, of Memmingen, and\r\nthey both sent their compliments to Wolfgang's father and sister. It is\r\nplain that the boy rejoiced in the feeling of freedom and independence:\r\n\"_Viviamo come i principi_, and want nothing but my dear father; but\r\nit is God's will, and all will go well. I hope you will be well and as\r\ncontented as I am. I am getting quite expert, and, like another papa,\r\ntaking care of everything. I have always to pay the postilions, for\r\nI can talk to the fellows better than mamma. Pray take care of your\r\nhealth, my dear father.\"\r\n\r\nTheir first stay was at Munich. The state of affairs there, coupled with\r\ntheir former failure, gave little hope of a prosperous visit; but it\r\nwas necessary to make the attempt. Furnished with his diplomas of the\r\nAcademies of Bologna and Verona, and with recommendations from Padre\r\nMartini, Wolfgang might present himself before the Elector Maximilian as\r\na thoroughly trained musician; and might hope to gain such favour from\r\ninfluential patrons as would justify his undertaking new works. They\r\ntook up their abode with their old acquaintance Albert,[1] known as \"the\r\nlearned host.\" Wolfgang's first visit was to Count Seeau, the inspector\r\nof plays.[2] He met with a friendly reception, and was advised by the\r\nCount to seek an audience of the Elector without delay, and if he\r\ndid not succeed, to address him by letter; there was no doubt that a\r\nfirst-rate composer was wanted in Munich.\r\n\r\nWolfgang next paid his respects to the Prince Bishop of Chiemsee, Count\r\nZeil, who was residing in Munich on a\r\n\r\n{MUNICH AND AUGSBURG.}\r\n\r\n(352)\r\n\r\ndiplomatic mission. He conversed freely on Mozart's plans, and promised\r\nto do his best for him with the Elector and his consort. But some days\r\nlater the Bishop said to him, \"very politely\" (September 29,1777): \"I do\r\nnot think you will do much here. I spoke privately on the subject to the\r\nElector at Nymphenburg, and he answered, 'It is too soon yet, let him\r\ntravel in Italy, and make himself a name; I do not refuse anything, but\r\nit is too soon yet.'\" The Electress promised to do what she could, but\r\n\"shrugged her shoulders,\" and doubted of success.\r\n\r\nThese unfavourable prognostics were justified when Mozart, introduced by\r\nthe influential violoncellist, Frz. Xav. Wo-schitka (b. 1730), presented\r\nhimself to the Elector, who was on the point of going hunting with his\r\ncourt. He gives the following account of the interview to his father\r\n(September 30, 1777)--\r\n\r\nWhen the Elector approached me I said: \"I trust your highness will allow\r\nme to lay myself and my services at your highness's feet.\" \"Indeed! have\r\nyou left Salzburg altogether?\" \"Altogether, your highness.\" \"Inded!\r\nWhy? Were you kept too close?\" \"May it please your highness, I asked\r\npermission to travel, which was refused, whereupon I took a step which\r\nhad long been in my mind, for Salzburg is no place for me, that\r\nis certain.\" \"_Mein Gott_, young man! But your father is still at\r\nSalzburg?\" \"Yes, may it please your highness; he lays his humble duty,\r\n&c. I have been in Italy three times already, have written three operas,\r\nand been elected Member of the Academy at Bologna, after writing a trial\r\ncomposition in one hour which usually takes candidates four or five\r\nhours of hard labour; all this proves that I am in a position to serve\r\nany court. My greatest wish is to serve your highness, who is himself\r\na great\"--\"Yes, my dear fellow, but I have no vacancy.\" \"I assure your\r\nhighness that I should do honour to Munich.\" \"No doubt, no doubt; but\r\nthere is no vacancy.\" This he said as he was going, and I could only\r\ntake my humble leave.\r\n\r\nThe Elector being unable, as L. Mozart was aware, to engage any one\r\nunless there were a vacancy, no court office could be looked for at\r\nMunich, but there seemed fair prospects of an assured position in\r\nanother direction. Count Seeau had interest enough to retain so\r\ndistinguished a composer, whose energy and productiveness promised good\r\nservices. He was not only manager, but also part\r\n\r\n{MUSIC AT MUNICH, 1777.}\r\n\r\n(353)\r\n\r\nproprietor of the theatre; the Elector paid the band and the ballet, and\r\ngave a yearly contribution of 9,000 gulden to the expenses, which was\r\nreceived by Seeau. In return the latter provided the opera and the play,\r\nand engaged the members of the two companies, chiefly natives of Munich,\r\nwho were to be had for eight to twelve gulden a month.[3] The Italian\r\nopera was only given during the carnival, and at great court festivals,\r\nand then generally without remuneration; German operas were the rule,\r\nthat is, adaptations from the French or Italian, for as yet original\r\nGerman opera did not exist. What a brilliant success might be expected,\r\nfrom the lively interest of the Munich public in all matters theatrical,\r\nif a man of Mozart's genius were to devote himself to German opera!\r\nSeeau inquired of the Bishop of Chiemsee if Mozart did not receive\r\nenough from home to allow him to remain there on a small salary; he\r\nshould like to keep him; the Bishop doubted this. Count Seeau preferred\r\nreceiving a proposal, and remained silent; but Mozart could perceive\r\nthat he was turning the matter over in his mind. He himself was all on\r\nfire at the idea of having operas to compose. He gives his father an\r\nanimated account of the impression made upon him by the performance of a\r\nGerman opera, and by the vocalist (October 2, 1777):--\r\n\r\nThe prima donna is named Keiserin; she is the daughter of the cook of a\r\nnobleman here, a pleasant girl, and pretty on the stage; I have not seen\r\nher nearer yet. She is a native of Munich. I heard her the third time\r\nthat she played, and thought she had a beautiful voice, not very strong,\r\nbut not weak either, and a pure, good intonation. Valesi is her teacher,\r\nand her style shows that her master understands singing as well as\r\nteaching singing. When she had to sustain a note for a couple of bars,\r\nI was surprised at the beauty of her _crescendo_ and _decrescendo_.\r\nShe has a slow shake, which I like extremely; it is all the clearer\r\nand purer when she wants to make it quicker, and the quicker it is the\r\neasier it is. She is an immense favourite with the people here, and\r\nI agree with them. Mamma was in the body of the theatre; she went at\r\nhalf-past four, in order to secure a seat I did not go till half-past\r\nsix, for I am well enough known to have the _entrée_ to any of the\r\nboxes. I watched Mdlle. Keiserin with my glass, and she drew more than\r\none tear from\r\n\r\n{MUNICH AND AUGSBURG.}\r\n\r\n(354)\r\n\r\nme; I cried \"Brava, bravissima,\" very often, remembering that this was\r\nonly her third appearance. The piece was called \"The Fisher-Girl\" (La\r\nPescatrice), a good translation, with Piccinni's music, but with nothing\r\noriginal in it. They want to have a German opera seria soon--and they\r\nwish me to compose it.\r\n\r\nAmong the \"wishers\" was a certain Professor Huber, whom Mozart had met\r\nat the Messmers' during his last visit to Vienna (1771); they renewed\r\ntheir acquaintance at Herr Albert's, where the professor was a frequent\r\nvisitor. He was the deputy-manager of the theatre, and had, as Mozart\r\nexpressed it, \"to read all the pieces submitted for performance, to\r\nimprove, spoil, accept, reject them.\" This censorship was necessary,\r\nsince the management performed all that was sent in, and was bound to\r\nput in study every native production. And as at that time \"almost\r\nevery student and official in Munich was bitten with the mania for\r\nauthorship,\"[4] they were overwhelmed with trash. Huber must have felt\r\nit a matter of importance to retain such a remarkable genius as Mozart\r\nfor the Munich theatre.\r\n\r\nThe wish, indeed, was generally felt; Baron Rumling paid Wolfgang the\r\ncompliment of saying: \"The theatre is my delight, with good actors and\r\nactresses, good singers, male and female, and such a capital composer\r\nas you are!\" Of this Wolfgang says (October 2, 1777): \"It is only\r\ntalk, certainly--and talk does not go far--but he never spoke so to me\r\nbefore.\" Wolfgang played several days in succession before Count Jos.\r\nvon Salem, the chief director of music and the opera (b. 1718);[5]\r\nhe played a good deal \"out of his head,\" then the two \"cassatione\"\r\n(247,287, K.) composed for the Countess Lodron, and the finalmusik (250\r\nK.):--\r\n\r\nYou cannot think how delighted the Count was; he understands music, for\r\nhe cried \"Bravo!\" every time that other fine gentlemen take a pinch of\r\nsnuff, blow their noses, cough, or begin a conversation. I said to him\r\nthat I wished the Elector were there, that he might hear what I could\r\ndo, of which he knows nothing. All these great people believe whatever\r\nis told them, and refuse to judge for themselves. It is always the way.\r\nI offered him a trial; he was to get together all the artists in\r\n\r\n{PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS IN MUNICH.}\r\n\r\n(355)\r\n\r\nMunich, and any he chose from Italy, France, Germany, England, and\r\nSpain; I would undertake to write against any of them. I told him what\r\nhad happened in Italy, and begged him, if the talk turned upon me, to\r\nremember all this. He said: \"I have very little influence; but what I\r\ncan do I will, with all my heart.\"\r\n\r\nHe had some intercourse with musicians, too; Consoli had met him on his\r\nentrance into the town, and lost no time in visiting him, and his old\r\nfriend Becke, the flautist, soon made his appearance. Albert arranged a\r\nlittle concert (\"with a wretched clavier, alas! alas!\"), and invited a\r\nclergyman, Dubreil, a pupil of Tartini, with the idea that he was a good\r\njudge, and a clever performer; but this turned out to be a mistake.\r\n\r\nWe first played Haydn's two quintets, but it was dreadful; I scarcely\r\nheard him; he could not play four bars without mistakes; his fingering\r\nwas bad, and he left out all the _sospiri_.[6] He was very polite, and\r\npraised the quintets, but--Then I played my concerto (clavier) in C, in\r\nB flat, in E flat major (238, 246, 271, K.), and my trio (254 K.). The\r\naccompaniment was fine; in the adagio I had to play six bars of his\r\npart. Last of all, I played the last cassation in B (287 K.), and\r\nthey all stared. I played as if I were the greatest fiddler in Europe\r\n(October 6, 1777).\r\n\r\nHerr Albert, who took great interest in Wolfgang, far beyond merely\r\nentertaining him,[7] made him a proposal which might render it possible\r\nfor him to remain in Munich. He promised to bring ten friends together,\r\nwho should each contribute one ducat a month, or 600 florins a-year; it\r\nwould be easy to get commissions from Count Seeau which would raise\r\nhis income to 800 florins. \"What do you think of this idea?\" writes\r\nWolfgang, overjoyed; \"is it not an act of friendship? and should I not\r\naccept it, if it is really in earnest?\" There was the immediate future\r\nto be provided for, and for this he was assured that the concerts would\r\nbegin in November, and last until May (one was given in Herr Albert's\r\nhall every Saturday), and then strangers came to the town; if he only\r\nstayed now, he was quite certain of\r\n\r\n{MUNICH AND AUGSBURG.}\r\n\r\n(356)\r\n\r\nan engagement. Wolfgang's mother thought well of this proposal; but his\r\nfather, as a man of the world, had many scruples (October 4, 1777):--\r\n\r\nHerr Albert's proposition is, indeed, as great an act of friendship as\r\none can imagine; but, though it does not appear to have occurred to you,\r\nthe difficulty, to my mind, will be to find the ten people who are to\r\ngive the ducat a month. Who are these philanthropists and lovers of\r\nmusic? What is their connection with you, and what services will they\r\ndemand in return? I do not see where they are to come from. Herr Albert\r\nwould scarcely be able to speak to them all without delay; some of them\r\nmay be away from Munich. For myself, I should prefer mercantile men to\r\nnoblemen. It all depends upon whether they keep their word, and for how\r\nlong. If the thing is feasible, well and good; it ought to be accepted;\r\nbut, unless it can be settled at once, you cannot stay there spending\r\nmoney and losing time, for no profit is to be expected in Munich, in\r\nspite of all their compliments and promises.\r\n\r\nHe turned out to be right: the ten philanthropists and lovers of music\r\ndid not come forward, and Wolfgang had to submit more than once to\r\nreproaches for his readiness to believe in \"fires of straw, which\r\nburn up quickly and end in smoke.\" But even without such aid, Wolfgang\r\nthought he might maintain himself in Munich for the present (October 2,\r\n1777).\r\n\r\nIt would not be impossible for me to get on alone; I should get, at\r\nleast, 300 florins from Count Seeau; I need not concern myself as to my\r\nboard; I should be always invited out, and even if I were not, nothing\r\npleases Herr Albert more than my taking my meals with him.\r\n\r\nI should contract with Count Seeau (on the advice of my best friends) to\r\nsupply him yearly with four German operas, some _buffe_, some _serie_.\r\nThen if I had a _sera_, or benefit, on each, as is the custom here, that\r\nwould give at least 500 florins, which would bring my income up to 800\r\nflorins, and probably more, for Reiner, a comedian and singer, took\r\n200 florins for his _sera_, and I am a _great favourite_ here; I should\r\nbecome a far greater if I helped to raise the German drama by my music.\r\n\r\nMozart had clearly some confidence in his own powers; he did not think\r\nit much to offer to write four German operas every year, and a salary of\r\n+three hundred gulden did not strike him as being poor pay for the work.\r\nBut Count Seeau appears to have been too prudent to risk even so much as\r\nthis, and L. Mozart was still less inclined to consent to a\r\n\r\n{MOZART AND COUNT SEEAU.}\r\n\r\n(357)\r\n\r\nplan which based all its calculations on future and uncertain profits,\r\nand would not redound to Wolfgang's honour. \"You might certainly manage\r\nto live alone in Munich,\" he wrote (October 6, 1777), \"but what good\r\nwould this do you? How the Archbishop would sneer! You can do that\r\nanywhere else as easily as in Munich. You must not make little of your\r\ntalents, and throw yourself away; there is certainly no need for that.\"\r\nWolfgang's sister was of the same opinion: \"It would be no honour to you\r\nto remain in Munich without any official position. It would be better\r\nto seek one at some other court; you will soon find it.\" The father\r\ndesired, therefore, that they should leave Munich as soon as possible.\r\n\"Fine words and bravissimos pay neither the postboy nor the host. As\r\nsoon as you find there is nothing to be got, you had better move on.\"\r\nThe good friends he had made might go on working for him in his absence,\r\nand preparing the way for a future position for him. He suggested this\r\nto Count Seeau, as he tells his father (October 3, 1777).\r\n\r\n\"I have come to explain my affairs correctly to your excellency. I\r\nhave been told that I ought to travel in Italy. I was sixteen months in\r\nItaly, and wrote three operas, as is well known. What happened further\r\nyour excellency will see by these documents.\" I showed him the diplomas.\r\n\"I lay all this before your excellency in order that if there is any\r\ntalk of me, and any injustice done me, your excellency may be able to\r\nset it right.\" He asked me if I was going to France now. I said I should\r\nremain in Germany. He thought I meant Munich, and said, with a joyful\r\nlaugh: \"What! you are going to remain here?\" I said: \"No; I should like\r\nto have stayed; and, to tell the truth, I only sought service under\r\nthe Elector in order that I might supply your excellency with my\r\ncompositions, and that without any personal interest; I should have\r\ntaken pleasure in it.\" Whereupon he pushed back his nightcap.\r\n\r\nThis then was the end of all the fine promises and honours. But other\r\nprospects were opened to Wolfgang during his stay in Munich, which\r\nexcited his liveliest interest. Misliweczeck, his Italian friend (p.\r\n126), had produced at the carnival in Munich his opera, \"Ezio,\"[8] and\r\nduring Lent his\r\n\r\n{MUNICH AND AUGSBURG.}\r\n\r\n(358)\r\n\r\noratorio, \"Abraamo ed Isaaco,\" both with astonishing success; he was\r\nengaged for the next carnival at Naples, and only kept in Munich by\r\nillness.[9] He gave Wolfgang prospects of a _scrittura_ in Naples, and\r\nwrote a letter on his behalf to the impresario, Don Gaetano Santorio.\r\nMozart, with his \"inexpressible longing to write an opera once more,\"\r\nwrote joyfully to his father (October 10, 1777):--\r\n\r\nI have my hundred ducats certain in the carnival; and, when I have once\r\nwritten at Naples, I shall be in request everywhere. As you know, in\r\nsummer and autumn there is an opera buffa to be picked up here and\r\nthere, which will do to keep one's hand in. It is true that one does\r\nnot make much, but it is always something, and one gains more honour and\r\ncredit than by a hundred concerts in Germany. I am more pleased, too,\r\nbecause I have to compose, which is my sole passion and delight, Then,\r\nif I obtain service, or the hope of it, the _scrittura_ will be a great\r\nrecommendation. I speak exactly as I feel from my heart, and if you can\r\nprove to me that I am wrong, I shall be ready, although unwillingly,\r\nto submit; for, if I only hear the name of an opera, I am quite beside\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nBut the father was not against it, and only thought that this interlude\r\nmust not cause the main object of the journey to be lost sight of. He\r\ntherefore corresponded with Misli-weczeck, but soon observed that the\r\nlatter only mentioned the _scrittura_ when he had some favour to ask for\r\nhimself. In point of fact, nothing came of this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe same ill-success attended the father's effort to obtain for Wolfgang\r\na commission to write an opera for the Feast of the Ascension in Venice;\r\nthe impresario Michele dall' Agata returned no answer to two letters\r\naddressed to him (February 12, 1778).\r\n\r\nOn October 11 the travellers left Munich, and reached Augsburg the\r\nsame evening. Following L. Mozart's minute directions they established\r\nthemselves at \"The Lamb\" in\r\n\r\n{VON LANGENMANTEL--STEIN.}\r\n\r\n(359)\r\n\r\nthe Kreuzgasse, \"where you pay thirty kreutzers for dinner, get nice\r\nrooms and good society, English, French, &c.\" Wolfgang was well received\r\nby his uncle, and contracted a close friendship with his lively cousin\r\nMarianne, which may have compensated in some degree for the coldness of\r\nhis reception generally in his father's native town.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to his father's strict injunctions, he waited at once upon\r\n\"his Grace\" the town-councillor Von Langen-mantel, with whom L. Mozart\r\nhad been well acquainted in former years. But Wolfgang gained little\r\nencouragement from this audience, of which he gives his father the\r\nfollowing account:--\r\n\r\nMy first visit was to the town-councillor, Master Longotabarro; my\r\ncousin, a dear, good man and an honest citizen, accompanied me, and had\r\nthe honour of waiting in the ante-room like a lackey until I came out\r\nfrom the arch-town-councillor. I did not fail to begin by presenting my\r\nfather's humble respects. He was pleased to remember all about it,\r\nand asked me: \"How has the gentleman been all this time?\" to which I\r\nanswered: \"God be praised, quite well; I hope that your health has also\r\nbeen good.\" Afterwards he was still more polite, and said, \"Sir,\" and\r\nI said, \"Your Grace,\" as I had all along. Nothing would satisfy him but\r\nthat I should go up with him to his son-in-law (on the second floor),\r\nand my cousin waiting on the steps all the while. It was with difficulty\r\nthat I refrained from saying something, with all my politeness. Upstairs\r\nI had the honour of playing for three-quarters of an hour upon a good\r\nclavichord, by Stein, in the presence of the stiff and starched son of\r\nhis long-necked, gracious, lady-wife, and her silly old mother. I played\r\nfantasias, and then everything he had _prima vista_, among others some\r\nvery pretty pieces by a certain Edlmann. They were all exceedingly\r\npolite, and I was exceedingly polite, for it is my custom to be to\r\npeople as I find them; it is the best way.\r\n\r\nThe next visit was to the celebrated organ and clavier maker, Georg\r\nAndr. Stein (1728-1792). The father conceived the idea that Wolfgang\r\nshould present himself to Stein under a feigned name, and should\r\npretend that he came from Innspruck with a commission to inspect some\r\ninstruments. Such a joke was quite to Wolfgang's mind, and he told his\r\nfather how it had passed. During his visit to the town-councillor he had\r\nexpressed his intention of calling upon Stein after dinner:--\r\n\r\n{MUNICH AND AUGSBURG.}\r\n\r\n(360)\r\n\r\nThe younger gentleman thereupon volunteered to accompany me. I thanked\r\nhim for his kindness, and promised to come at two o'clock. I came, and\r\nwe set out in company with his brother-in-law, who looks exactly like\r\na student. Although I had begged them not to say who I was, Herr von\r\nLangenmantel blurted out, \"I have the honour to introduce to you a\r\nvirtuoso on the clavier.\" I protested, and said I was an unworthy\r\ndisciple of Herr Sigl, of Munich, by whom I was charged with many\r\ncompliments, &c. He shook his head, and at last said: \"Have I the honour\r\nof seeing Herr Mozart?\" \"Oh, no,\" said I; \"my name is Trazom, and I have\r\na letter to you.\" He took the letter and was going to open it. I did not\r\ngive him time, and said, \"Why should you read the letter now? Let us go\r\ninto the hall and see your pianofortes, which I am most curious to do.\"\r\n\"With all my heart; but I do not think I am deceived.\" He opened the\r\ndoor of his show-room. I ran to one of the three claviers which stood\r\nthere. I played. He could scarcely take time to open the letter, his\r\ncuriosity was so excited. He read only the signature. \"Oh!\" he screamed,\r\nand embraced me, and crossed himself, and made grimaces, and was\r\naltogether very delighted.\r\n\r\nMozart, for his part, was equally delighted with Stein's pianofortes, of\r\nwhich he gives his father the following detailed account:--\r\n\r\nBefore I had seen Stein's work I preferred Späth's claviers to all\r\nothers, but now I must give the preference to Stein's, for they mute\r\nmuch better than Späth's. If I strike hard, whether I raise my finger\r\nor not, the sound passes the instant I have heard it. I may come upon\r\nthe keys as I like, the tone is always the same; it does not block, it\r\nneither becomes stronger nor weaker, nor does it cease altogether; in\r\na word, it is all equal. Such a pianoforte, it is true, cannot be\r\nhad under 300 florins, but the trouble and labour bestowed on it are\r\ninestimable. His hammers fall the instant the keys are struck, whether\r\nthey are held down or not. When such an instrument is finished (he told\r\nme himself), he sits down and tries all sorts of passages, runs, and\r\njumps, and works away until he is satisfied. He often said: \"If I were\r\nnot such a passionate lover of music myself, and were not able to play\r\na little on the clavier, I should long ago have lost patience with my\r\nwork; but I am a lover of instruments which do not tax the player, and\r\nwhich wear well.\" And his claviers do wear well. He guarantees that the\r\nsounding-board shall not spring. When a sounding-board is ready for a\r\npiano, he exposes it to air, rain, snow, sun, so that it may warp, and\r\nthen he puts on slips and glues them down, so that it is all strong and\r\ntrue. He is glad when it warps, because then he is sure that nothing\r\nmore will happen. He has three such pianofortes finished. I have played\r\nupon them again to-day. The pedal, which is pressed by the knee, is\r\nbetter managed by him than by others. If I only just touch it, it acts;\r\nand when the knee is removed there is not the least vibration.\r\n\r\n{MARIA ANNA STEIN.}\r\n\r\n(361)\r\n\r\nMozart knew how to make the most of these improved instruments. His\r\nplaying and his intelligent admiration so won Stein's approbation,\r\nthat the latter followed the advice Wolfgang gave him concerning the\r\neducation of his daughter. Maria Anna Stein (b. 1769) was the prodigy of\r\nAugsburg; in April, 1776, she had played her first concerto to\r\nuniversal admiration, and had received a beautiful medal from the town\r\nnobility.[10] Wolfgang's criticism on her playing to his father (October\r\n24, 1777) is somewhat severe, but so important as showing his views on\r\npianoforte-playing in general that it must be given entire. The memory\r\nof the excellent Frau Nanette Streicher will not suffer from the bold\r\ncriticism of the young Mozart:--\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of his daughter. Whoever sees her and hears her without\r\nlaughing must be as much of a stone (Stein) as her father himself. She\r\nsits right up in the treble, instead of in the middle of the instrument,\r\nso that she may be better able to move about and make grimaces. Her eyes\r\nroll, and she simpers and smirks. If a thing comes twice over, it is\r\nplayed slower the second time; and if a third time, it is slower still.\r\nThe arm goes high, up in the air when a passage comes, and the emphasis\r\nis given by the whole arm instead of the finger, clumsily and heavily.\r\nBut the best of all is when, in a passage that ought to flow like oil,\r\nthe fingers have to be changed; it makes no difference at all to her,\r\nbut, when the time comes, up goes her hand, and she begins again quite\r\ncalmly; so that one is always in expectation of a wrong note, which\r\nmakes the effect very striking. I only write all this to give you some\r\nidea of what clavier-playing and teaching may be brought to; I leave you\r\nto make your own use of the hints. Herr Stein is quite infatuated over\r\nhis daughter; she is eight and a half years old, and learns everything\r\nby heart. She may turn out something--she has genius; but as she is\r\ngoing on at present she will not turn out anything; she will never gain\r\nfluency, because she is doing all she can to make her hand heavy. She\r\nwill never learn the most difficult and most necessary part of music,\r\nthat is _time_, because she has been accustomed from her earliest youth\r\nto play out of time. Herr Stein and I had at least two hours' talk on\r\nthis point. I think I nearly converted him, and now he asks my advice\r\nabout everything. He was quite infatuated in Beecké. Now he sees and\r\nhears that I play better than Beecké, that I make no grimaces, and yet\r\nplay with so much expression that I show off his pianofortes better than\r\nany one. The correctness of my time\r\n\r\n{MUNICH AND AUGSBURG.}\r\n\r\n(362)\r\n\r\nastonishes them all. The _tempo rubato_ in an adagio, with the left hand\r\nkeeping strict time, was quite past their comprehension; they always\r\nfollow with the left hand.[11]\r\n\r\nThe expressions about Beecké, who was considered among the best\r\npianoforte-players, are only repetition of what was said on all sides.\r\n\"Count Wolfegg, and several others who are very enthusiastic for Beecké,\r\nsaid lately at a public concert that I had thrown Beecké quite into\r\nthe shade,\" writes Wolfgang in confirmation of his own opinion. Even\r\nArchbishop Hieronymus was reported to have said aside to his favourites\r\nthat Beecké was a charlatan and a merry-andrew, and that Mozart far\r\nsurpassed him (June 29, 1778). He played a tolerably difficult sonata\r\nby Beecké, _prima vista_, \"miserabile al solito\"; how the kapellmeister\r\nGraf and the organist Schmitthauer crossed themselves over the\r\nperformance may be better imagined than described.\r\n\r\nMozart's organ and violin-playing created quite as much astonishment as\r\nhis performances on the clavier:--\r\n\r\nWhen I told Herr Stein that I should like to play upon his organ (in the\r\nBarfüsserkirche), for that I had a passion for the organ, he was greatly\r\nastonished, and said: \"What! a man like you, a clavier-player, willing\r\nto play on an instrument which has no _douceur_, no expression; which\r\nallows of neither _piano_ nor _forte_, but goes on always the same!\"\r\n\"All that has nothing to do with it. To my mind, the organ is the king\r\nof all instruments.\" \"Well, do as you like.\" So we went together. I\r\ncould guess by his way of talking that he did not expect me to do his\r\norgan much credit; he thought I should play clavier fashion. He told me\r\nhow he had taken Chobert to the organ according to his request. \"And I\r\nwas sorry,\" said he, \"for Chobert had told everybody, and the church\r\nwas full. I had imagined the fellow would be full of spirit, fire, and\r\nrapidity, and that would tell on the organ; but as soon as he began\r\nI changed my opinion.\" I only said, \"What do you think, Herr Stein? Are\r\nyou afraid that I shall come to grief on the organ?\" \"Ah, you! that is\r\nquite different.\" We went into the choir; I began to prelude, at which\r\nhe laughed with delight; then followed a fugue. \"I can well believe,\"\r\nsaid he, \"that you enjoy playing the organ, when you play like that.\" At\r\nfirst I did not quite understand the pedal, because it was not divided.\r\nIt began C, then D E in a row. With us D and E are above, where E flat\r\nand F sharp are here. But I soon grew accustomed to it.\r\n\r\n{AUGSBURG, 1777.}\r\n\r\n(363)\r\n\r\nHe played the organ also in the monastery of St. Ulrich, which had the\r\ndreadful steps, and often visited the monastery of the Holy Cross, where\r\nhe was invited to dine on October 19, and entertained with music during\r\nthe meal (October 24, 1777).\r\n\r\nHowever badly they may play, yet I prefer the music of the monastery to\r\nthe Augsburg orchestra. I played a symphony and the violin concerto in\r\nB flat by Wanhall with universal applause. The Dean is a good, jolly\r\nfellow; he is a cousin of Eberlin's, named Zeschinger, and remembers\r\npapa very well. In the evening at supper I played the Strasburg concerto\r\n(219 K.). It went as smooth as oil. They all praised the beautiful pure\r\ntone. Afterwards a little clavichord was brought in. I preluded, and\r\nplayed a sonata, and the Fischer variations. Then some one whispered to\r\nthe Dean that he should hear me play organ fashion. I said he might give\r\nme a theme, but he would not, so one of the monks did. I led off with\r\nit, and in the middle (the fugue was in G minor) I began in the major,\r\nin a playful style but in the same time, and then came back to the\r\ntheme. At last it occurred to me that I might use the playful style\r\nfor the theme of the fugue. Without more ado I tried it, and it went\r\nas accurately as if it had been measured for by Daser (the Salzburg\r\ntailor). The Dean was quite beside himself. \"I could never have believed\r\nit,\" said he; \"you are a wonderful man. My Abbot told me that he had\r\nnever in his life heard such correct and solemn organ-playing.\" The\r\nAbbot had heard me two or three days before, when the Dean was not\r\nthere. Finally, some one brought a sonata which was fugued, for me to\r\nplay. But I said, \"Gentlemen, this is too much; I must acknowledge that\r\nI cannot play this sonata at once.\" \"I think so, too,\" said the Dean,\r\neagerly, for he was quite on my side; \"that is too much; it would be\r\nimpossible for any one.\" \"Still,\" said I, \"I will try it.\" And all the\r\ntime I played I heard the Dean calling out behind me, \"Oh, you rascal!\r\noh, you young scamp!\" I played until eleven o'clock. They bombarded me\r\nwith themes for fugues, and laid siege to me on all sides.\r\n\r\nIn return for his kind reception and the pleasure expressed in his\r\nplaying, Wolfgang presented the Abbot Barth. Christa (1760-1780) with\r\nseveral compositions, the Masses in F (192 K.), in C (220 K.), and the\r\n\"Misericordias Domini\" (222 K.). He refers to them in writing to his\r\nfather, as well as to a litany, \"De venerabili\" (November 20, 1777).\r\nWhat has become of this last we do not know.[12]\r\n\r\n{MUNICH AND AUGSBURG.}\r\n\r\n(364)\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this applause from connoisseurs, the prospects of a\r\nconcert were not good. At first a brilliant reception was expected. Herr\r\nvon Langenmantel, son of the town-councillor, had taken the matter\r\ninto his own hands and promised to arrange a \"chamber concert\" for the\r\n_patricii_ only. But some days later he invited Wolfgang, and after he\r\nhad played as long as the company pleased, explained to him that the\r\nconcert could not take place, since \"the _patricii_ were not in funds.\"\r\n\r\nAs if this was not enough, the _patricii_ thought fit to make sport\r\nof him at table. In accordance with his father's advice that he should\r\ninsure respect and consideration for himself in places where there was\r\nno reigning prince, by wearing the order conferred on him by the great\r\nPope Ganganelli, Wolfgang wore the cross of his order at Augsburg. This\r\nwas made an occasion for mockery; and one officer in particular, Bach by\r\nname, was so rude and insulting that Wolfgang lost patience, and repaid\r\nhim in kind, calling him \"Herr von Kurzmantl\"; but he does not seem ever\r\nto have worn the order again. He had promised to attend, and perhaps to\r\nplay at, the weekly concert given during the winter months by a society\r\nof noblemen, both Catholic and Protestant;[13] but, indignant at the\r\ntreatment he had received, he declared he would only give a concert\r\nfor a few invited friends and connoisseurs. They were Catholic nobles,\r\nhowever, who had insulted him, and Stein set in motion the evangelical\r\n(not Lutheran, as L. Mozart reminds his son) nobles,[14] who made such\r\nfriendly overtures that he\r\n\r\n{CONCERT AT AUGSBURG, OCTOBER, 1777.}\r\n\r\n(365)\r\n\r\nattended a concert given by the \"peasant nobles,\"[15] and played one\r\nof his symphonies, taking the violin himself, and then a concerto and a\r\nsonata. Compliments and eulogies were heaped upon him, and finally two\r\nducats were presented to him. Wolfgang's father thought him far too\r\nyielding: \"One thing is very certain,\" he writes (October 20, 1777),\r\n\"they would not have found me at their beggarly concert. In the\r\nmeantime, through the exertions of his friends, a public concert was\r\ngiven on October 22:--\r\n\r\nWhat do you think came next after the symphony? The concerto for three\r\nclaviers (242 K.). Herr Demmler played the first, I the second, and Herr\r\nStein the third. Then I played alone the last sonata in D (284 K.), then\r\nmy concerto in B flat (238 K.), then a fugue in C minor, and a splendid\r\nsonata in C major out of my own head, with a rondo at the end. There\r\nwas a tremendous noise and confusion. Herr Stein made one grimace after\r\nanother for delight. Herr Demmler actually laughed. This eccentric being\r\nalways laughs when anything pleases him. This time he began to swear.\r\nCount Wolfegg ran about the room, saying, \"I never heard anything like\r\nit in my life.\" He said to me, \"I must tell you that I never heard you\r\nplay so well as to-day; I will tell your father so as soon as I get to\r\nSalzburg.\"\r\n\r\nL. Mozart's heart was rejoiced by \"a wonderfully fine article in the\r\nnewspaper,\" probably from the pen of Herr von Sabnesnig, of whose\r\ncharming poetry he had reminded Wolfgang.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the receipts of the concert were small, considering\r\nthat he had put forth all his powers;[16] ninety gulden, with sixteen\r\ngulden thirty kreutzers' expenses. Wolfgang was not tempted to retract\r\nwhat he had written to his father in anger, about the behaviour of the\r\naristocrats (October 16, 1777):--\r\n\r\nI must say that if I had not found such good and charming cousins\r\nI should repent ever having set foot in Augsburg. I must tell you\r\nsomething about my dear little cousin, but I will wait till to-morrow,\r\nfor I ought to be in good spirits to praise her as she deserves. Early\r\non the\r\n\r\n{MUNICH AND AUGSBURG.}\r\n\r\n(366)\r\n\r\n17th I shall write and assure you that our little cousin is pretty,\r\nsensible, charming, clever, and merry; she knows something of the world,\r\nhaving been in Munich some time. We two suit each other exactly, for she\r\nis just a little wicked;[17] we laugh at everybody, and have great fun.\r\n\r\nDefending his cousin against a slighting expression of his father's,\r\nWolfgang says, \"Yesterday, to please me, she dressed _à la française_,\r\nand looked five per cent, prettier.\" He gave her his portrait in a\r\nlittle medallion, and made her promise to be painted in French costume.\r\nA mournful parting ended this happy visit, Stein having written to\r\nWolfgang's father in the most eulogistic manner concerning his son's\r\nperformances. At the next quoit-playing meeting in Salzburg there\r\nappeared on the quoit a representation of \"the sad adieux of two persons\r\ndissolved in tears, Wolfgang and his cousin.\" \"The quoit was charming,\"\r\nwrote the father (November 17,1777); \"an Augsburg maiden stood at the\r\nright and presented a young man in top boots, equipped for travelling,\r\nand in the other hand she carried a wonderful linen cloth trailing on\r\nthe ground, with which she dried her eyes. The gentleman had a similar\r\ncloth, which he was putting to the same use, and he held his hat in his\r\nother hand. Written above were six lines of poetry, expressive of the\r\nsorrowful emotions of the young couple.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThis good-humoured participation in the little adventures of his son\r\nstands in striking and effective contrast to the earnest care which\r\nbreathes from a letter addressed to Wolfgang on his fête-day (October\r\n31):--\r\n\r\nI must wish you happiness on your fête-day. But what more can I wish for\r\nyou than I am always wishing? I wish that the grace of God may be with\r\nyou everywhere, and never forsake you as long as you are diligent in\r\nperforming the duties of a true Catholic Christian. You know me, and\r\nknow that I am no pedant, no canting hypocrite; but\r\n\r\n{HOHENALTHEIM, 1777}\r\n\r\n(367)\r\n\r\nyou will not refuse your father one prayer. This is, that you will have\r\nsuch concern for your soul that you may cause your father no anguish\r\non his death-bed in the thought that he has been careless of the things\r\nwhich concern your salvation. Farewell! be happy; be wise. Honour and\r\ncherish your mother, who is troubled in her old age for your sake. Love\r\nme as I love you. Your faithful, anxious father.\r\n\r\nThe son's answer is in the tone of reverence which it becomes children\r\nto adopt on such occasions to their parents:--\r\n\r\nI kiss your hand, and thank you humbly for your good wishes on my\r\nfête-day. Have no concern for me; I have God ever before my eyes; I\r\nacknowledge His omnipotence, I fear His anger; but I also acknowledge\r\nHis love, His mercy and pity towards His creatures; He will never\r\nforsake His servants. I submit myself wholly to His will, and so it\r\ncannot fail I must be happy and content. I shall also be diligent to\r\nfollow the commands and the counsel which you are so good as to give me.\r\n\r\nOn October 26 Wolfgang and his mother left Augsburg, and proceeded by\r\nway of Donauwörth and Nordlingen to Hohenaltheim, the residence of the\r\nPrince von Oetting-Wallerstein.[19] Music was held in high honour\r\nat this little court; not only were celebrated performers, such as\r\nJanitsch, the violinist, Reicha, the violoncellist, Perwein, the\r\noboist, &c., encouraged to settle there, but the whole orchestra was\r\ndistinguished for its delicacy of execution. Rosetti, the conductor,\r\nhad \"carried his observance of the most delicate gradations of tone\r\nsometimes to the bounds of pedantry.\"[20] Ignaz von Beecké, captain in a\r\nWurtemberg dragoon regiment, was manager of the court music, and himself\r\na distinguished clavier-player and composer. The Prince, a handsome\r\nyoung man, who had formerly invited Wolfgang to visit him in Naples, was\r\nsuffering from an attack of melancholy, and unable to bear music; but\r\nthe Mozarts were obliged to remain several days at Hohenaltheim on\r\naccount of the mother's severe cold. A rumour reached L. Mozart that\r\nWolfgang had been playing the buffoon there, that he had danced about,\r\nplaying the violin, and had gained the\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(368)\r\n\r\nreputation of being a wild, merry fellow. He considered that this would\r\nafford Beecké, who was jealous of Wolfgang, an excellent opportunity of\r\ndepreciating his powers as an artist (January 26, 1778), Wolfgang gave a\r\ndecided contradiction to this report; he had \"sat at the officers'\r\ntable with all due honour, and had not said a word to any one; when with\r\nBeecké, too, he had been quite serious.\" Beecké had received him kindly,\r\nhad promised him advice and support should he ever go to Paris, and had\r\nheard him play. They had talked about Vienna, too, and agreed that the\r\nEmperor Joseph was a fair executant, but not a true lover of music.\r\nBeecké said that he had only played fugues and such like \"trifles\"\r\nbefore him, and that he had heard music in the Emperor's cabinet which\r\nwas enough to frighten the very dogs away. They also confided to each\r\nother that music gave them both the headache; only good music had this\r\neffect with Beecké, and bad with Mozart.\r\n\r\nThe travellers entered Mannheim on October 30. Their stay was longer\r\nthan they had intended, and although the hopes with which it opened were\r\nnot destined to be fulfilled, yet the months passed in Mannheim were\r\nfruitful in their effect on Wolfgang's development, both musical and\r\n\r\nThe Elector, Karl Theodor,[21] had studied in his early youth under the\r\nJesuits, and had then visited the Universities of Leyden and Lowen,\r\ndisplaying a great taste for science, poetry, art, and music, the last\r\nof which he practised himself. The extravagance which he lavished on\r\nhis court and on his park of Schwetzingen--the Versailles of the\r\npalatinate--was carried also in some degree into the affairs of science\r\nand art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Müller, Abschied von der Bühne, p. 215.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Rudhart, Gesch. d.

MANNHEIM\r\n\r\nThe Palatinate Academy of Science, founded in 1763, encouraged\r\nhistorical and scientific research; collections of pictures and\r\nengravings,\r\n\r\n{ART IN THE PALATINATE.}\r\n\r\n(369)\r\n\r\nand an exhibition of plaster casts from the antique--at that time the\r\nonly, and much-thought-of collection of the kind in Germany[2]--served,\r\nin connection with an academy, to encourage the formative arts; and a\r\nGerman society, founded in Mannheim by the Elector in 1775, proved\r\nthe desire of its members to take their share in the new impulse which\r\nGerman literature had then received.[3]\r\n\r\nKlopstock's presence in this year had not been without its influence;\r\nnot content with native authors, such as Gemmingen, Klein, Dalberg, the\r\npainter Müller, the Elector sought, but in vain, to attract acknowledged\r\ncelebrities, such as Lessing[4] and Wieland.[5] His zealous co-operation\r\nwas given to the plan of founding a German drama in the place of the\r\nusual French one;[6] the national theatre was built,[7] and efforts were\r\nmade to retain Lessing as dramatist and Eckhoff as actor.[8] When this\r\nfailed, the engagement of Marchand secured them at least a first-rate\r\nactor.[9]\r\n\r\nBut music was incontestably the peculiar province of Mannhein, the\r\n\"paradise of musicians.\"[10] Here too, patriotic\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(370)\r\n\r\nfeeling was supreme.[11] Original German operas took the place of the\r\ngrand Italian opera, with its appendage of translated comic opera,\r\ngenerally borrowed from the French.[12]\r\n\r\nThe performances of the Seiler company of actors, which had come to\r\nWeimar in the autumn of 1771 in the place of the Koch company, suggested\r\nto Wieland the idea of a grand, serious German opera in addition to the\r\noperettas which had met with so much success.[13] His \"Alcestis\"[14]\r\nwas intended as an important step in this direction, as is proved by\r\nhis \"Letters on the German opera of 'Alcestis,'\"[15] which, by their\r\ncomparison of himself with Euripides, called forth Goethe's burlesque.\r\nHis opera met with ready acknowledgment, but at the same time with\r\nsevere and deserved blame.[16] It was thought to be too evidently\r\nfashioned after Metastasio's pattern, both in plan and treatment; and\r\nto be wanting in dramatic interest, true passion, and lively\r\ncharacteristic; the public found the opera tedious and trivial, and\r\ntook just umbrage at the conception of Hercules as a virtuous humdrum\r\ncitizen. Wieland found in Schweitzer an ideal composer, who identified\r\nhimself with the poet, who could be silent when the poet wished to speak\r\nalone, but who hastened to aid him at need with all the resources of\r\nmusical art; a composer, too, who thought more of producing a true\r\nimpression on the mind of his hearers, than of flattering their ears,\r\ninciting their curiosity or even adhering too closely to the mechanical\r\nrules of his art. Wieland was not content with placing Schweitzer on\r\na level with the best Italian composers; in a letter to Klein[17] he\r\nspeaks of Gluck's \"Alceste\" as a divine work, but does not hesitate to\r\ndeclare Schweitzer's composition to be the best that had\r\n\r\n{SCHWEITZER'S \"ALCESTE.\"}\r\n\r\n(371)\r\n\r\never been heard of the kind. Schweitzer's music[18] was in fact\r\nmuch applauded, and he was judged to have accomplished more than the\r\npoet.[19] His efforts after a true and forcible musical expression of\r\nemotion, and after originality, are worthy of all praise; and phrases\r\nhere and there, particularly in the accompanied recitative, are of\r\ncharming effect, while the orchestra is carefully treated, and not at\r\nall after the usual manner of Italian opera. On the other hand he has\r\nbeen justly blamed for his slavish adherence to the old form of the\r\naria, with da capo, middle passage, bravura passages, and ritomello;\r\nhe is unequal, too, and his effects are all those of detail. What is\r\nwanting is genius, original power of creation, which forms details into\r\none great whole, and produces something altogether new and complete.\r\nThis was felt by Zelter[20] and by Mozart, who wrote to his father\r\nthat the best part of Schweitzer's melancholy \"Alceste\" (besides the\r\nbeginnings, middles and endings of some of the songs) was the beginning\r\nof the recitative, \"O Jugendzeit,\" and the worst (together with the\r\ngreater part of the opera) was the overture. This consists of two\r\nmovements, an adagio and a fugue, which are both unimportant and\r\ncommonplace.\r\n\r\n\"Alceste\" was first performed in Weimar on May 28, 1773, and frequently\r\nrepeated, always with the greatest success;[21] this was also the case\r\nin Gotha and Frankfort; and on August 13, 1775, Karl Theodor produced\r\nthe opera with great brilliancy at Schwetzingen.[22] The success was\r\ngreat, and it was considered as marking an epoch that a German opera,\r\nwritten by a German poet, composed by a German musician, and sung by\r\nGerman artists, should be produced successfully by a German Prince. In\r\nthe following summer\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(372)\r\n\r\nWieland received a commission to write a new opera, which Schweitzer was\r\nto compose under his immediate direction.\r\n\r\nThe way being once cleared, it was easy to take further steps in the\r\nsame direction. The Elector hit upon the idea of representing scenes\r\nfrom the national history in German musical dramas.[23] Professor Anton\r\nKlein, formerly a Jesuit, and always one of the most zealous supporters\r\nof the patriotic struggle then proceeding, wrote for this purpose\r\n\"Günther von Schwarzburg,\"[24] which was composed by Holzbauer,[25] and\r\nperformed on January 5, in the magnificent opera-house,[26] with all the\r\nexpenses guaranteed.[27] Schubart had anticipated with joy \"the glorious\r\nrevolution in taste,\"[28] and the applause was great, although the\r\nsuccess was not so deep and lasting as might have been expected. The\r\ncritics[29] found much in the text at which to take exception; Wieland\r\nshrank from speaking in the \"Mercury\" about \"this so-called opera\" for\r\nfear lest, absurd as it might appear, his criticism might be taken for\r\nenvy.[30] An evident effort is made to give the work a deeper tone than\r\none of mere patriotic sentiment; but in spite of the exalted emotion and\r\npassion of the words and music, and of all that could be done in the way\r\nof scenic accessories, the opera was too wanting in dramatic treatment\r\nand characterisation to take very deep root. The phraseology is in\r\nimitation of Klopstock, but the effort after force and\r\n\r\n{\"GÜNTHER V. SCHWARZBURG.\"}\r\n\r\n(373)\r\n\r\noriginality is so clumsily made that Wieland's contempt is justified.\r\nOf the music, it was said by the minister Hompesch that the predominant\r\nfeeling and ideas were neither French nor Italian, but genuinely\r\nGerman;[31] Schubart praised its mixture of German feeling and foreign\r\ngrace,[32] and other critics spoke of its stamp of genius and its\r\ngentle grace.[33] Mozart, who saw the opera the day after his arrival at\r\nMannheim, wrote to his father (November 16, 1777): \"Holzbauer's music is\r\nvery fine; far too good for the poetry. I am amazed at the spirit of so\r\nold a man as Holzbauer, for you would not believe the amount of fire\r\nin his music.\" The force and animation of Holzbauer's music are still\r\napparent, though it is wanting in elevation and true musical sentiment.\r\nHe has not attained to original dramatic characterisation except in\r\nsingle touches, more especially in the recitatives; he never deviates\r\nfrom the customary Italian form, but the adaptation of this form to\r\nGerman song was in itself considered a remarkable innovation.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished vocalists, male and female, of the Mannheim\r\nopera were, thanks to Holzbauer's excellent school of music, almost all\r\nGermans.[34] Among them was Dorothea Wendling (_née_ Spumi, 1737-1811),\r\n\"the German Melpomene of Mannheim's Golden Age,\"[35] who excited\r\nuniversal admiration by her perfect and expressive singing. According to\r\nWieland she surpassed even Mara, and he found in her his ideal of song,\r\nas the language of the mind and the heart, every note being the living\r\nexpression of the purest and most ardent emotion, and the whole song a\r\ncontinuous thread of beauty.[36] Her beauty (Heinse saw in her\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(374)\r\n\r\ncountenance all that was caressing, soft, and feminine, combined with\r\nthe glow and animation of a passionate nature)[37] and her excellent\r\nacting[38] elevated her performances to a very high point. Her\r\nsister-in-law, Elizabeth Auguste Wendling (_née_ Sarselli, 1746-1786),\r\nthough less famous, and hindered by continued ill-health, was\r\nnevertheless a praiseworthy singer; while Franciska Danzi (1756-1791),\r\nmarried afterwards to the oboist, Le Brun,[39] was an artist of the\r\nfirst rank, in her beauty and the compass of her voice, as well as\r\nin her thorough musical cultivation: at the time of Mozart's visit to\r\nMannheim she was in London on leave of absence.[40]\r\n\r\nBut the fame of these youthful singers was far surpassed by that of the\r\nnow elderly tenor Anton Raaff.[41] He was born in 1714 at the village\r\nof Holzem, not far from Bonn, and was educated at the Jesuit seminary in\r\nBonn. He had a beautiful voice, and the ease with which he sang by ear\r\nmade it a great labour to him to learn his notes. The Elector Clemens\r\nAugust, who heard him sing in church, provided for his education as a\r\nsinger, and gave him a salary of 200 thalers. After causing him to study\r\na part in an oratorio, the Elector took him to Munich, where he was\r\nengaged by Ferrandini (p. 133) to appear in opera. This led to his going\r\nto study at Bologna under Bemacchi, from whose severe school he came\r\nforth as one of the finest tenor singers of the century. He sang in\r\n1738 at Florence, at the wedding of Maria Theresa, left Italy in 1742 to\r\nreturn to Bonn, where his salary was raised to 750 florins, and sang at\r\ndifferent German courts; in 1749 he performed in Jomelli's \"Didone\" at\r\nVienna, to Metastasio's great satisfaction.[42] After a short stay in\r\nItaly, he repaired in 1752 to\r\n\r\n{ANTON RAAFF.}\r\n\r\n(375)\r\n\r\nLisbon for three years, and from thence in 1755 to Madrid, where he\r\nlived in close friendship with his musical director, Farinelli.[43] In\r\n1759 they went together to Naples; here, it is said, his singing made so\r\ndeep an impression on the Princess Belmonte-Pignatelli as to cure her\r\nof a deep melancholy into which she had been thrown by the death of her\r\nhusband.[44] On his return to Germany, in 1770, the Elector Karl Theodor\r\nbesought him to enter his service, on which Raaff modestly declared that\r\nhe should esteem himself happy if the Elector would be content with the\r\nsmall remnant of his powers which was left to him. His voice was of\r\nthe finest tenor quality that could be heard, from the deepest to the\r\nhighest notes even, clear, and full. With a perfect mastery of the art\r\nof song, displaying itself in his extraordinary power of singing, at\r\nsight and of varying and introducing cadenzas, he combined a feeling\r\ndelivery \"that seemed but an echo of his own good heart,\" and a clear,\r\ndeliberate judgment on things musical.[45] Added to all this his\r\nenunciation was so distinct that even in the largest hall not a syllable\r\nwas lost. When Mozart first heard him in \"Günther von Schwarzburg\" his\r\nchief impression was that of an old man's failing strength. He writes\r\n(November 8, 1777):--\r\n\r\nHerr Raaff sang his four songs and about 450 incidental bars in such a\r\nmanner as to show that it is want of voice which makes it so bad.\r\nUnless one reminds oneself all the time that it is Raaff, the old and\r\ncelebrated tenor, who is singing, one cannot help laughing. As for\r\nmyself, if I had not known it was Raaff, I should have died of laughing.\r\nAs it was, I took out my handkerchief and blew my nose. He never was,\r\nthey tell me, anything of an actor; he should only be heard, not seen;\r\nhis presence is not at all good. In the opera he has to die, singing\r\na long, long, slow air, and he died with a smiling mouth, his voice\r\nfalling so at the end as to be quite inaudible. I was sitting in the\r\n\r\nMANNHEIM.\r\n\r\n(376)\r\n\r\norchestra, next to Wendling, the flute-player, and I remarked that it\r\nwas unnatural to expect a man to go on singing till he fell down dead.\r\n\"Never mind,\" said I, \"a little patience, and it will soon be over.\" \"I\r\nthink it will,\" said he, and laughed.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing him oftener, Mozart did more justice to Raaff's artistic\r\nskill, but he always thought his style wanting in simplicity. In\r\na letter from Paris (June 12, 1778) he pronounces a more detailed\r\njudgment, true to his convictions, yet anxious not to wrong the\r\nexcellent man, of whom he was extremely fond:--\r\n\r\nAt his _début_ in the \"Concert Spirituel\" here he sang Bach's scena,\r\n\"Non so d'onde viene,\" which is my favourite song. I never heard him\r\nsing it before, and he pleased me; his style suits the song, but the\r\nstyle in itself, that of the Bernacchi school, is not at all to my\r\ntaste. There is too much in it of _cantabile_. I grant that when he\r\nwas younger and in his prime the effect must have been sometimes quite\r\nstartling. I like it, too, but there is too much of it; it is often\r\nludicrous. What really pleases me is his singing of certain little\r\nthings andantino, which he does in his own style. Everything in its\r\nplace. I imagine that his forte was bravura singing, which gives him\r\nstill, in spite of age, a good chest and a long breath. His voice is\r\nfine, and very pleasant. If I shut my eyes when he is singing I hear\r\nconsiderable resemblance to Meissner's, only Raaff's voice is the\r\npleasanter of the two. Meissner, as you know, has the bad habit of\r\nendeavouring to make his voice tremble; Raaff never does this; he cannot\r\nbear it. But, as far as true _cantabile_ is concerned, I like Meissner\r\nbetter than Raaff, though he, too, according to my judgment, makes too\r\nmuch of it. In bravura passages and roulades, and in his good distinct\r\nutterance, Raaff bears off the palm.\r\n\r\nAll who saw Raaff on the stage pronounced him to be no actor, but only\r\na singer. In private he preserved the serenity and moderation of\r\nan estimable and genuinely pious character. His moral conduct was\r\nfaultless, his opinions earnest and severe. He had occasional fits of\r\npassion, but was for the most part good-humoured and benevolent, a true\r\nand self-denying friend. No wonder that Mozart conceived a strong and\r\nlasting attachment to such a man as this.[46]\r\n\r\n{CHURCH MUSIC IN MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(377)\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished tenor singer in Mannheim, after Raaff, was his\r\npupil Frz. Hartig (b. 1750).[47]\r\n\r\nChurch music in Mannheim did not stand on the same high level as the\r\nopera.[48] Schubart complains that little attention was paid to the true\r\nchurch style, that the old masses were despised, and new ones introduced\r\nin the most effeminate and mincing operatic style. Even Holzbauer's\r\nsacred compositions were far inferior to his operas.[49] Mozart heard a\r\nmass by Holzbauer, \"written twenty-six years ago, but very good,\" as he\r\nwrites to his father (November 4, 1777); \"he writes well, in good\r\nchurch style, with fine passages for the voices and instruments.\"\r\nNotwithstanding, he was far from pleased with the Mannheim church music\r\non the whole, and did not care, as he writes in the same letter, to have\r\none of his own masses performed there:--\r\n\r\nWhy? On account of their brevity? No, for everything here is short.\r\nOn account of their church style? Not at all; but only because, under\r\npresent circumstances, it is necessary to write principally for the\r\ninstruments, since nothing more wretched than the vocal department can\r\nbe conceived. Six soprani, six alti, six tenori, and six bassi to twenty\r\nviolins and twelve basses stand just in the proportion of 0 to 1, do\r\nthey not, Herr Bullinger? They have only two male sopranos, and both\r\nold--just dying out. The soprano prefers singing the alto part, because\r\nhis upper notes are gone. The few boys that they have are wretched, and\r\nthe tenors and basses are like singers at a funeral.\r\n\r\nThe organ was still worse provided for, and Mozart pours out the full\r\nmeasure of his scorn on the two court organists:--\r\n\r\nThey have two organists here, for whose sake alone it would be worth\r\ntaking the journey to Mannheim. I had a good opportunity of hearing\r\nthem, for it is the custom here to omit the Benedictus, and for the\r\norganist to go on playing instead. The first time I heard the second\r\norganist, and the next time the first; but I have a better opinion of\r\nthe second than of the first. When I heard him I asked, \"Who is at the\r\norgan?\" \"Our second organist.\" \"He plays wretchedly.\" When I\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(378)\r\n\r\nheard the other I asked, \"Who is that?\" \"Our first organist.\" \"He plays\r\nmore wretchedly still.\" I suppose if they were shaken up together the\r\nresult would be something worse still. It makes one die of laughing to\r\nsee them. The second goes to the organ like a child to the mud; he shows\r\nhis trade in his face. The first wears spectacles. I stood at the organ\r\nand watched him for the sake of instruction. He lifts his hands high up\r\nat every note. His _tour de force_ is the use of the sext stop; but he\r\noftener uses the quint, or the octave stop. He often playfully lets fall\r\nthe right hand, and plays only with the left. In a word, he does as he\r\nlikes; he is so far completely master of his instrument.\r\n\r\nBut Mannheim was distinguished most particularly for its instrumental\r\nmusic, the orchestra being unanimously considered the finest in Europe.\r\nIt was more numerous and better appointed, especially as to wind\r\ninstruments, than was customary at the time.[50] It was here that Mozart\r\nfirst became acquainted with the clarinet as an orchestral instrument.\r\n\"Oh, if we only had clarinetti!\" he writes (December 3, 1778). \"You\r\ncannot think what a splendid effect a symphony makes with flutes, oboes,\r\nand clarinets.\"[51]\r\n\r\nBurney had only one fault to find, a fault common to all orchestras\r\nof the day, viz., the occasionally defective intonation of the wind\r\ninstruments.[52] The Mannheim orchestra was not only well-appointed and\r\nstrong, but uniform and certain in execution, with delicate gradations\r\nof tone until then\r\n\r\n{THE MANNHEIM ORCHESTRA.}\r\n\r\n(379)\r\n\r\nunknown.[53] Piano and forte were rendered in the most varied degrees;\r\ncrescendo and diminuendo were first invented at Mannheim, and for a long\r\ntime other orchestras made no attempt at imitation;[54] other\r\nmeans, too, such as the skilful blending of the wind and stringed\r\ninstruments,[55] were made the most of to produce a well-arranged,\r\nfinely gradationed whole.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of the Mannheim orchestra--whose performances excited as\r\nmuch admiration among contemporaries[56] as those of the Paris orchestra\r\nunder Habeneck's conductor-ship in our own time--gained for it the\r\nhonour of taking a regular share in the Elector's concerts (p. 288).[57]\r\nThe band contained some of the first artists and virtuosi of the day,\r\nsuch as Cannabich, Toeschi, Cramer, Stamitz, and Frànzel among the\r\nviolins, Wendling as a flute-player, Le Brun and Ramm as oboists, Ritter\r\nas bassoonist, and Lang as hom-player. But its fame rested chiefly\r\non the excellent discipline of the orchestra, which, among so\r\nmany first-rate artists, it was no easy task to maintain.[58] The\r\nkapellmeister at the time of Mozart's visit was Christian Cannabich\r\n(1731-1798), who had succeeded Stamitz in 1775. His compositions were\r\ndoubtless overrated by his contemporaries; but he was admirable as a\r\nsolo violinist, and still better as an\r\n\r\nMANNHEIM.\r\n\r\n(380)\r\n\r\norchestral leader, besides being an excellent teacher. The majority of\r\nthe violinists in the Mannheim orchestra had issued from his school, and\r\nto this was mainly owing the uniformity of their execution and delivery.\r\nCannabich, who was more of an organiser than an originator, had\r\nexperimented with every condition and device for producing instrumental\r\neffects, and he laid special stress on technical perfection of\r\nexecution, in order to insure good tutti players. Uniting, as he\r\ndid, intelligence and a genius for direction[59] to \"a true German\r\nheart,\"[60] and a moral and temperate life, he possessed the confidence\r\nand esteem of his musicians, and was therefore the better able to bring\r\ntheir performances to the highest excellence.\r\n\r\nThe many-sidedness of musical performances in Mannheim had helped to\r\nform a very original taste, and Karl Theodor himself was careful to\r\nencourage composers and virtuosi of all kinds.[61] The groundwork, both\r\nof thought and instruction, was Italian certainly; but the fact that\r\nthe care of musical affairs was intrusted to German musicians, had an\r\ninfluence of its own, even before the national element had asserted its\r\nsupremacy in Germany. French influence, too, made itself felt side by\r\nside with the Italian; the connection maintained by the Elector\r\nPalatine with the court of Versailles was profitable in every way to his\r\nmusicians. Finally, the partiality for instrumental music which we have\r\nalready noted must have tended to give an independent impulse to musical\r\nproduction in Mannheim.\r\n\r\nHis stay in a town so thoroughly and genuinely musical,[62] must have\r\nhad a more abiding effect upon Mozart than was exercised by Salzburg,\r\nAugsburg, or even Munich. He came to Mannheim at a time when the minds\r\nof men were full of fresh and eager aspirations after artistic and\r\nliterary\r\n\r\n{CHR. DANNER.}\r\n\r\n(381)\r\n\r\nexcellence; and fortunately for him the interest was mainly centred on\r\nhis own peculiar province--the drama. We cannot imagine, however, that\r\nhe was dazzled or abashed by the wealth of musical knowledge, or by the\r\naccomplishments of the noted musicians with whom he came in contact;\r\nhis confidence in his own powers preserved him from any feeling of\r\nconstraint or distrust. At first he was surprised at the small amount\r\nof attention which his presence excited. On the day after his arrival he\r\nmade the acquaintance of the violinist, Chr. Danner (b. 1745), and went\r\nwith him to rehearsal.[63] \"I thought that I should not be able to keep\r\nfrom laughing, when I was introduced to people. Some of them, who knew\r\nme _per renommée_, were polite and respectful; but the rest, who did\r\nnot know anything of me, stared at me in the most ludicrous manner. They\r\nthink because I am little and young that there can be nothing great or\r\nold in me; but they shall soon see.\" Mozart always resented, even\r\nin later years, any reference to his small stature and unimposing\r\nappearance, even when it was made by way of contrast to his great\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\nHis predictions were verified. It was not long before he had gained the\r\nesteem and admiration of the Mannheim musicians, the ready goodwill\r\nwith which he placed his talents and services at their disposal, and\r\nhis cheerfulness and good breeding in society, rendering him a universal\r\nfavourite. His spirits rose in proportion as the memory of his position\r\nat Salzburg faded from his mind. Even from Munich he wrote to his father\r\n(September 26, 1777): \"I am always in the best of spirits. I feel as\r\nlight as a feather since I left all that chicanery behind! I am fatter,\r\ntoo, already.\" At Mannheim, in daily intercourse with cultivated\r\nartists, he\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(382)\r\n\r\nmust have felt completely at his ease. The members of the band were\r\nwell paid[64] and well treated; Karl Theodor's love of music and general\r\naffability gave them considerable freedom of position, and intercourse\r\nwith their circle was liberal and pleasant. Schubart declares that the\r\nhouses, tables, and hearts of all the musicians were open to him during\r\nthe whole of his stay, and that he had his share in their practisings\r\nand their festivities.[65] Mozart's experience was the same; although,\r\nhis stay being longer, he could not fail to observe that the superficial\r\nfrivolity of court life had affected the tone even of the artistic\r\ncircles.[66]\r\n\r\nHis friendly reception by Cannabich led to an intimate friendship and\r\ndaily intercourse with the whole family, in which Wolfgang's mother was\r\nincluded. He often dined with them, and no long time elapsed before he\r\nfound himself \"_al solito_\" at supper and spending the evening with the\r\nCannabichs; they chatted, played a little sometimes, or Wolfgang used\r\nto take a book out of his pocket and read. Occasionally the party became\r\nmerrier and not quite so decorous, as the following mock confession made\r\nby Wolfgang to his father will show (November 14,1777):--\r\n\r\nI, Johannes Chrisostomus Amadeus Wolfgangus Sigismundus Mozart, do\r\nhereby confess that both yesterday and the day before (and on various\r\nother occasions) I remained out until twelve o'clock at night; and that\r\nfrom ten o'clock until the above-named hour I was at Cannabich's house,\r\nin company with Cannabich, his wife and daughter, Herr Schatzmeister,\r\nHerr Ramm, and Herr Lang, making rhymes and perpetrating bad jokes\r\nin thought and word, but not in deed. But I should not have conducted\r\nmyself in so godless a fashion had not the ringleader of the sport, the\r\nabove-named daughter, Liesel, incited and abetted me therein; and I must\r\nacknowledge that I found it extremely amusing. I bewail all these my\r\nsins and transgressions from the bottom of my heart; and, hoping to\r\nconfess the same thing very frequently, I make an earnest resolution to\r\namend my former sinful life. I therefore beg for a dispensation, that is\r\nif it is an easy one; if not, it is all the same to me, for the game is\r\nnot like to come to an end very soon.\r\n\r\n{THE CANNABICH FAMILY.}\r\n\r\n(383)\r\n\r\nThat Mozart was always ready when music was wanted we cannot doubt; on\r\none of his first visits to Cannabich he played all his six sonatas one\r\nafter the other. Cannabich was not slow to recognise his extraordinary\r\ntalent, nor to make use of it on occasion, as when Wolfgang made good\r\nclavier arrangements of his ballets for him. But self-interest had no\r\nshare in the feelings with which he came to regard Wolfgang; both he and\r\nhis wife loved him as their own son, threw themselves zealously into all\r\nthat concerned his wellbeing, and watched over him as true friends.\r\nThe magnet which attracted Wolfgang to the house at first, and kept him\r\nchained there for a time, was Cannabich's eldest daughter Rosa, who\r\nwas then thirteen, \"a pretty, charming girl,\" as Wolfgang writes to his\r\nfather (December 16,1777); \"she has a staid manner and a great deal of\r\nsense for her age; she speaks but little, and when she does speak it is\r\nwith grace and amiability.\"[67] The day after his arrival (October 31)\r\nshe played something to him; he thought her playing good, and began to\r\ncompose a sonata for her, as a mark of attention to Cannabich. The first\r\nallegro was ready on the same day. \"Young Danner asked me\" he continues,\r\n\"what I meant to do for the andante. 'I mean to make it exactly like\r\nMdlle. Rose herself.' When I played it they were all wonderfully\r\npleased. Young Danner said afterwards, 'You were quite right; the\r\nandante is exactly like her.'\" On November 8 he wrote the rondo at\r\nCannabich's, \"consequently they would not let me away again. Mdlle.\r\nRose's talent gained in interest for him when, on studying this sonata\r\nwith her, he found that it had been neglected. \"The right hand is very\r\ngood, but the left is utterly ruined; if I were her regular master I\r\nwould lay aside all music, cover the keys with a handkerchief, and make\r\nher practise passages, shakes, &c., first with the right\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(384)\r\n\r\nhand and then with the left, slowly to begin with until the hands were\r\nperfectly independent; after that I believe I should make an excellent\r\nplayer of her.\" The regular lessons followed in due time; he gave an\r\nhour daily to the young lady, and was very well satisfied with the\r\nresult. \"Yesterday she gave me indescribable pleasure,\" he writes\r\n(December 6,1777), \"by playing my sonata most beautifully. The andante\r\n(a slow one) was full of feeling; she enjoys playing it.\" His father\r\nthought the sonata wonderfully good (December 11, 1777); there was a\r\nlittle of the Mannheim affected taste in it, but not enough to spoil\r\nWolfgang's own good style.\r\n\r\nAnother musician with whom Mozart entered into very friendly relations\r\nwas the distinguished flute-player, Joh. Bapt. Wendling. Cannabich\r\nintroduced him; \"every one was as polite as could be\" he informs\r\nhis father. \"The daughter Augusta, who was at one time the Elector's\r\nmistress, plays the clavier well.[68] Afterwards I played. I was in an\r\nexcellent humour, and played everything out of my head, and three duets\r\nwith the violin, which I had never seen before in my life, and the name\r\nof whose author I did not even know. They were all so delighted that\r\nI was obliged--to kiss the ladies! I had no objection as far as the\r\ndaughter was concerned, for she is not by any means ugly.\" He composed a\r\nFrench song for this Mdlle. Gustl, of whom Wieland said that she was so\r\nlike one of Raphael's or Carlo Dolce's Madonnas, that he could hardly\r\nrefrain from addressing a \"Salve Regina\" to her.[69] She had given him\r\nthe words, and her delivery of them was so charming that the song was\r\ncalled for every day \"at Wendling's,\" and they all \"raved about it.\" He\r\npromised to compose some more for her, and one at least was begun at\r\na later time.[70] An aria with recitative was also sketched out for\r\nDorothea Wendling, the mother; she had herself selected the words from\r\n\r\n{FLUTE AND OBOE CONCERTOS.}\r\n\r\n(385)\r\n\r\nMetastasio's \"Didone\" (II. 4), \"Ah! non lasciarmi no, bell' idol mio,\"\r\nand she, as well as her daughter, \"went wild over this song.\" It was\r\nMozart's custom in sketching his songs to write out the bass entire, and\r\neven some indications of the accompaniment, so that the song could\r\nbe sung and in some measure accompanied from the sketch. Whether this\r\nparticular song was ever completed we do not know. Mozart did not forget\r\nWendling himself. We are told that a concerto of his was rehearsed at\r\nCannabich's, to which Mozart had arranged the instruments (November 22,\r\n1777). He had a dislike to the flute and a mistrust of flute-players,\r\nbut he made an exception in favour of Wendling. When Wend-ling's brother\r\nteased him for this he said: \"Yes, but you see, it is quite another\r\nthing with your brother. He is not a piper, and one need not be always\r\nin terror for fear the next note should be too high or too low--_he_ is\r\nalways right, you see; his heart and his ear and the tip of his tongue\r\nare all in the right place, and he does not imagine that blowing and\r\nmaking faces is all that is needed; he knows too what adagio means.\"[71]\r\n\r\nWolfgang presented his oboe concerto to the oboist Friedr. Ramm (b.\r\n1744), whom he met at Cannabich's, and who \"went wild\" over it (November\r\n4, 1777). He made it his _cheval de bataille_, playing it five times\r\nduring the same winter (February 13, 1778) with great success, \"although\r\nit was known to be by me.\"\r\n\r\nMozart soon became universally liked and admired, as well for his\r\nreadiness and good-nature in composing as for his performances on the\r\norgan and clavier; but we hear nothing more of his violin-playing. He\r\ngave a humorous description to his father of the effect made by his\r\norgan-playing soon after his arrival in Mannheim (November 13, 1777)\r\n\r\nLast Sunday I played the organ in the chapel for a joke. I came in\r\nduring the Kyrie, played the end of it, and, after the priest had given\r\nout the Gloria, I made a cadenza. Nothing like it had ever been heard\r\nhere before, so that everybody looked round, especially Holzbauer. He\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(386)\r\n\r\nsaid to me, \"If I had only known I would have chosen another mass.\"\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"in order to do for me altogether.\" Old Toeschi (the\r\nconcertmeister) and Wendling stood near me. The people were inclined to\r\nlaugh, because every now and then, when I wanted a _pizzicato_ effect, I\r\ngave little bangs to the notes. I was in my best humour. A voluntary\r\nis always played here instead of the Benedictus; I took the idea of the\r\nSanctus and carried it out as a fugue. There they all stood and made\r\nfaces. At the end, after the Missa est, I played another fugue. The\r\npedal is different from ours, and that puzzled me a little at first, but\r\nI soon got used to it.\r\n\r\nWhen the new organ in the Lutheran Church was tried (December 18) all\r\nthe kapellmeisters were invited, and Wolfgang's mother writes how a\r\ndistinguished Lutheran came and invited him also. He admired the organ\r\nboth in _pieno_ and in its single stops, but he disliked Vogler, who\r\nplayed it; he would not play much himself, only a prelude and fugue, but\r\nhe arranged to go again with a party of friends, and then he meant to\r\n\"have some rare fun on the organ.\" In the Reformed Church also, where\r\nthe organ was considered a remarkably fine one,[72] he once played to a\r\nfriend for an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nThe great admiration he excited as a clavier-player is described by his\r\nmother (December 28, 1777):--\r\n\r\nWolfgang is made much of everywhere; but he plays quite differently from\r\nwhat he does at Salzburg, for there are nothing but pianofortes here,\r\nand you never heard anything like the way he manages them; in a word,\r\nevery one that hears him declares that his equal is not to be found.\r\nAlthough Beecké has been here, as well as Schubart, they all agree that\r\nhe surpasses them both in beauty of tone, in gusto, and delicacy; and\r\nwhat they most admire is his playing out of his head whatever is laid\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nClavier-playing was less esteemed in Mannheim than proficiency on an\r\norchestral instrument, and Peter Winter, a true representative of the\r\nMannheim band, could not play the clavier at all, and could not abide\r\nsuch jingling noise, as he used to tell his friends.[73] But Mozart had\r\nplenty of opportunity for comparing himself with other clavier-players.\r\n\r\n{VOGLER AS A VIRTUOSO.}\r\n\r\n(387)\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Joh. Fr. Xav. Sterkel (1750-1817), one of the most celebrated\r\nperformers of the day, came from Mayence (where he was pianist and\r\nchaplain to the Elector)[74] during Mozart's stay at Mannheim. \"Last\r\nevening but one,\" he informs his father (December 26, 1777), \"I was _al\r\nsolito_ at Cannabich's, and Sterkel came in. He played five duets,\r\nbut so quick as to be unintelligible, and neither distinctly nor in\r\ntime--they all said so. Mdlle. Cannabich played the sixth, and she\r\nreally did it better than Sterkel.\"\r\n\r\nThe same fault that he found with Sterkel, viz., the endeavour to make\r\nan effect by rapid execution and playing at sight, in reality a mere\r\ndevice to hide imperfect execution, Mozart found also with the playing\r\nof Vogler (1749-1814), the solitary clavier performer resident at\r\nMannheim.\r\n\r\nHe tells his father (January 17, 1778) of his meeting Vogler at a large\r\nparty:--\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he had his two claviers brought, which were tuned together,\r\nand also his tiresome printed sonatas. I was obliged to play them, and\r\nhe accompanied me on the other clavier. I was obliged, at his pressing\r\nrequest, to have my sonatas brought also. Before dinner he had stumbled\r\nthrough my concerto--the Litzau one (246 K.)--_prima vista_;[75] the\r\nfirst movement went prestissimo, the andante allegro, and the rondo\r\nreally prestissimo. He played almost throughout a different bass to\r\nthe one that was written, and sometimes the harmonies, and even the\r\nmelodies, were altered. Indeed, this was inevitable, owing to the great\r\nspeed: the eye could not see and the hand could not grasp the music. But\r\nwhat kind of playing at sight is that? The hearers (those\r\n\r\nI mean, who are worthy of the name) can only say that they have _seen_\r\nmusic and clavier-playing. They hear and think and _feel_ just as little\r\nas the performer himself. You can imagine that the worst part of it to\r\nme is not being able to say: _Much too quick_. After all, it is much\r\neasier to play fast than slow; notes can be dropped out of passages\r\nwithout being noticed; but is that desirable? The rapidity allows the\r\nright and left hand to be used indiscriminately: but should that be so?\r\n\r\nIn what does the art of playing at sight consist? In playing the piece\r\ncorrectly, in strict time, giving the proper expression to every\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(388)\r\n\r\npassage and every note, so that it might be imagined that the player had\r\ncomposed the piece himself. Vogler's fingering is atrocious; his left\r\nthumb is like Adlgasser's, and he makes all the runs for the right hand\r\nwith his first finger and thumb.\r\n\r\nMozart's antipathy to Vogler shines through this description, and is\r\nequally apparent whenever he has occasion to mention him. Personally he\r\nhad nothing to complain of in Vogler: \"Herr Vogler positively insisted\r\non making my acquaintance,\" he writes to his father (January 17, 1778);\r\n\"after plaguing me very often to go to him, he put his pride in his\r\npocket and paid me the first visit.\" No assurance will be needed that\r\nthe rivalry of the two in composition, organ and clavier-playing, would\r\nnot lead Mozart to disparage great merit where it existed. It might have\r\ncontributed to sharpen his judgment, which, however, was essentially the\r\nsame as that passed on Vogler by the whole orchestra, \"from the highest\r\nto the lowest.\" He was regarded as an interloper, who had usurped an\r\nimportant position in Mannheim, and had intrigued against such men as\r\nHolzbauer for the purpose; the violet stockings which he wore as papal\r\nlegate were thought absurd;[76] and his habit of taking a prayer-book\r\ninto society, together with his music, and of frequently keeping\r\nvisitors waiting while he performed his devotions, was considered\r\nmere affectation;[77] many complaints were made of his haughty and\r\ndepreciatory manner; and his own performances fell far short of the\r\nexpectations excited by himself.\r\n\r\nBut apart from all influence of partisanship or gossip, it is quite\r\nconceivable that two such diverse natures should exercise a mutual\r\nrepulsion on each other. Vogler was no doubt an original and striking\r\ncharacter; the very fact that his contemporaries were either his\r\nenthusiastic admirers or his sworn enemies affords proof of this. He\r\npossessed musical talent, intellect and shrewdness, together with much\r\nenergy of character, so that his attainments were extensive both in the\r\narts and sciences.\r\n\r\n{VOGLER's CHARACTER.}\r\n\r\n(389)\r\n\r\nBut these qualities, uncombined with creative genius, could not reach\r\nthe highest beauty and truth, either in art or science. We find Vogler,\r\ntherefore, in whom creative genius did not exist, seeking for effect\r\nin the technicalities of his art, and as a consequence, in something\r\noutside the art itself. He prided himself especially on his programme\r\nmusic,[78] which was full of purely sensuous effects, and on his\r\nplaying, which was crowded with theoretical difficulties. The principal\r\ncharm was in both cases imported from without, not an essential product\r\nof the art itself. Vogler was the first to give this direction to\r\nmusical activity, striving to hide a deficiency in creative power under\r\ngeneral cultivation of mind, and, as a necessary result, hampering\r\nthe natural development of true art. His celebrated pupils Weber and\r\nMeyerbeer have rendered the same tendency fruitful in consequences to\r\nmodern music. A consistent endeavour after what is true and beautiful\r\nin art presupposes a singleness of mind in the artist which cannot\r\nexist with inordinate ambition and a calculating spirit. In truth the\r\ncontradictions in Vogler's moral nature, which were remarked even by his\r\nadherents,[79] were as striking as those in his artistic nature. If\r\nwe consider the impression such a man must have made on Mozart, whose\r\ncreative genius was its own measure and law, penetrating the very\r\nessence of his being, and elevating even the drudgery of his profession\r\nto the freedom of high art, we can comprehend how he would instinctively\r\nrecoil from Vogler; and how his own severe education, which had elevated\r\nand refined his nature without injuring his healthy love of truth, would\r\nprevent his doing full justice to his rival's merits. There can be\r\nno doubt that Mozart's opinion of Vogler, which he took no pains to\r\nconceal, gave great offence to the latter; but there is no evidence that\r\nhe \"plotted against him,\" as the father conjectures, nor does Wolfgang\r\nhimself make any such accusation. Among Vogler's adherents in Mannheim\r\nwas Peter Winter (1755-1826) who was \"almost the only\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(390)\r\n\r\nfriend, that is the only intimate friend, that Vogler had.\" His daily\r\nofferings to Vogler's vanity were much to be regretted;[80] he objected,\r\nhowever, in after-days to be called Vogler's pupil.[81] He seems to\r\nhave taken a dislike to Mozart, which the latter had cause to feel very\r\nsensibly.\r\n\r\nThe remaining members of the orchestra, however, were only the more\r\nattracted to Mozart by the position which he assumed in regard to\r\nVogler. Wendling and Ramm meditated a journey to Paris during Lent, and\r\nRitter, the bassoonist, was to precede them thither; they intended to\r\ngive concerts together, and Wendling proposed to Wolfgang to accompany\r\nthem, since such a composer and virtuoso as he would immeasurably\r\nstrengthen their company. Wolfgang was strongly inclined to consent, and\r\nwrote to his father (December 3, 1777):--\r\n\r\nIf I stay here until Lent, I shall accompany Wendling, Ramm the oboist\r\n(and a very fine one), and Lauchery, the ballet manager, to Paris. Herr\r\nWendling assures me that I shall have no cause to repent it. He has been\r\ntwice in Paris (has only lately returned), and says it is the only place\r\nwhere fame and money can be made. \"You are a man,\" says he, \"who can do\r\nanything. I will show you how to set about it: you must compose operas,\r\nserious and comic, oratorios, and everything.\" Whoever has written a\r\ncouple of operas in Paris is a made man at once; then there are the\r\nConcerts Spirituels, and the Académie des Amateurs, where you get five\r\nlouis d'ors for a symphony. If you give lessons, it is at the rate of\r\nthree louis d'ors for twelve. Sonatas, trios, and quartets are printed\r\nby subscription. Cannabich and Toeschi send a great deal of their music\r\nto Paris. Wendling is a man who understands travelling. Pray write me\r\nyour opinion on the subject. It seems to me a good idea. I shall travel\r\nwith a man who knows the Paris of the present day thoroughly, for it\r\nhas altered very much. I should spend little, indeed I think not half\r\nso much as now, for I should only have to pay for myself; mamma would\r\nremain here, and probably stay with the Wendlings. Herr Ritter, who\r\nplays the bassoon very well, sets out for Paris on the 12th inst. Ramm\r\nis a right honest, merry fellow of about thirty-five; he has travelled\r\nmuch, and knows the world well. The greatest and best musicians here\r\nlike and esteem me. I am always called Herr Kapellmeister.\r\n\r\nWolfgang's mother was not opposed to the project; she writes to her\r\nhusband (December 11, 1777):--\r\n\r\n{PLANS FOR A JOURNEY TO PARIS.}\r\n\r\n(391)\r\n\r\nAbout Wolfgang and his journey to Paris you must consider what is\r\nright: nowadays Paris is the only place to get on. Herr Wendling is an\r\nhonourable man, well known to all: he has travelled much, and been in\r\nParis thirteen times, so that he knows it thoroughly; our friend Herr\r\nvon Grimm is his best friend also, and has done much for him. So you\r\nmust decide as you like--I shall be ready to agree. Herr Wendling has\r\nassured me that he would act as Wolfgang's father. He loves him as his\r\nown son, and will, I am sure, take as good care of him as I do. You can\r\nwell imagine that I am averse to parting from him; and if I have to come\r\nhome alone, the long journey will be a great trial to me: but what can\r\nbe done? The journey to Paris would be more fatiguing and too expensive;\r\nfor one does not spend a fourth part travelling alone.\r\n\r\nIf this plan was to be carried out, Wolfgang must remain at Mannheim\r\nthrough the winter. His first endeavour, therefore, was to obtain a\r\nsituation in the band from the Elector, and his friends eagerly seconded\r\nhis efforts. Holz-bauer had taken him soon after his arrival to the\r\nmanager, Count Savioli (November 4, 1777),where Cannabich chanced to be\r\npresent:--\r\n\r\nHerr Holzbauer said to the Count in Italian that I wished for the honour\r\nof playing before his Highness the Elector: I had been here fifteen\r\nyears before, when I was eight years old; I was now older and taller,\r\nand my music had improved also. \"Ah,\" said the Count, \"that is young-,\"\r\nsomebody or other for whom he mistook me. Then\r\n\r\nCannabich began to speak. I pretended not to listen, and talked to some\r\none else, but I noticed that he spoke very earnestly. Then the Count\r\nsaid to me, \"I hear that you play fairly well on the clavier.\"\r\n\r\nI made an obeisance.\r\n\r\nThe Elector happened to be holding court at the time, and Count Savioli\r\nat once presented Wolfgang to the Electress, who received him very\r\ngraciously, and remembered his being there fifteen years before, though\r\nshe would not have recognised him. On November 6 there was a grand\r\nstate concert, at which Mozart played a concerto, and before the closing\r\nsymphony a sonata, and something \"out of his head\":--\r\n\r\nThe Elector and his wife and all the court were pleased with me. At\r\nthe concert, every time I played she and the Elector came quite near my\r\nclavier. After the concert, Cannabich intimated that I might speak to\r\nthe Elector. I kissed hands, and he said, \"I think it is fifteen years\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(392)\r\n\r\nsince you were here before?\" \"Yes, your highness; fifteen years since I\r\nhad the honour\"--\"You play remarkably well.\" When I kissed the hand of\r\nthe Princess she said, \"Monsieur, je vous assure, on ne peut pas jouer\r\nmieux.\"\r\n\r\nThe Electress informed him that she should like him to play to her\r\nalone, and they were obliged to remain until the command to do so\r\nshould arrive. Some days after, Count Savioli handed him his present,\r\na beautiful gold watch; ten gold caroli would, however, have been more\r\nuseful to him than the watch, which was valued at twenty. \"I have now\r\nwith your permission five watches. I have a great mind to have a pocket\r\nmade on each side, and to wear two watches (which is the fashion now) so\r\nthat it may not occur to any one to give me another.\"\r\n\r\nIn his father's opinion Wolfgang would do wrong to remain in Mannheim\r\nany longer than necessary, unless he had certain prospects of a\r\nsituation there; his good friends could watch over any future interests\r\nin his absence, and he ought not to lose the opportunity of making\r\nhimself known in different places, and of earning money. According\r\nto intelligence received from Frankfort, there was nothing to be made\r\nthere; but at Mayence, with the support of the concertmeister, Georg\r\nAnt. Kreuser, concerts might be arranged both in private, before the\r\nenthusiastically musical Elector, and in the town.[82] Something, too,\r\nmight be made at Coblentz out of the Elector Clemens, between whom and\r\nthe Elector Wolfgang had sat at table and composed with a pencil in\r\nMunich, when they were returning from England (p. 48). Nothing could be\r\ndone in Bonn.\r\n\r\nThey might return to Mannheim after such expeditions as these, if there\r\nwas any prospect of remaining there over the winter. Paris must only\r\nbe thought of as a last resource; it would be a difficult and a risky\r\nundertaking. To L. Mozart, who was continually revolving schemes in his\r\nmind, it seemed in no way right that the travellers should have settled\r\nthemselves so comfortably at Mannheim. Wolfgang, finding himself for the\r\nfirst time in a congenial\r\n\r\n{THE ELECTOR.}\r\n\r\n(393)\r\n\r\nprofessional atmosphere, and in familiar intercourse with cultivated\r\nminds, was only too ready to hearken when every one said to him: \"Where\r\ncan you go in the winter? The season is too bad for travelling; stay\r\nhere!\" And then the prospects which so many good friends opened to him\r\nappeared to him in no wise uncertain. His mother allowed herself to be\r\nled by her son and his friends, and was easily persuaded that to stay in\r\nMannheim would be most advantageous for Wolfgang.\r\n\r\nThe Elector had ordered Mozart to be conducted before his natural\r\nchildren, whom he visited for some hours every afternoon, taking great\r\ninterest in their studies. Mozart, who was accompanied by Cannabich,\r\nthus describes the interview (November 8, 1777):--\r\n\r\nI talked to the Elector quite familiarly. He is both gracious and good.\r\nHe said to me, \"I hear that you wrote an opera at Munich.\" \"Yes, your\r\nhighness. I humbly crave your grace, it is my greatest wish to write an\r\nopera here. I pray your highness not to forget me. I can write German,\r\ntoo, God be praised.\" Well, that may happen.[83] He has one son and\r\nthree daughters;[84] the eldest and the young Count play the clavier. The\r\nElector consulted me quite confidentially about his children. I spoke\r\nquite openly, but without blaming their master. Cannabich was of my\r\nopinion, too. When the Elector left he thanked me very politely.\r\n\r\nSome days after he went again, and \"played with his whole heart\" three\r\ntimes at the request of the Elector, who sat by him \"motionless\"; a\r\ncertain professor gave him a subject for a fugue. This seemed the surest\r\nway to the favour of the Elector. At Cannabich's instigation, as he\r\ntells his father (who counted on Cannabich's friendship,\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(394)\r\n\r\nhis interest being concerned on his daughter's account), he asked Count\r\nSavioli whether the Elector would not keep him there during the winter,\r\nand he would engage to give the children lessons. Cannabich promised\r\nto propose and support this plan to the Elector, but he must wait until\r\nafter the gala days, and then the best results might be expected. But a\r\nthing like this must not be hurried, and patience would be required,\r\nas Wolfgang informs his father, and admonishes him not to lose time\r\nin speculations, which generally prove useless. In the meantime he had\r\ndrawn on the banker for 150 gulden, \"for the host would rather hear the\r\njingle of money than of music.\"\r\n\r\nThis did not in any way please Wolfgang's father, who delivers a sharp\r\nreproof for his thoughtless expression as to the father's speculation\r\nbeing useless. \"Gerechter Gott!\" he writes, \"you tell me not to\r\nspeculate when I am in debt already on your account 450 florins, and\r\nyou think you will put me in good humour by writing all sorts of absurd\r\nnonsense.\" He shows them how little use they have made of their time so\r\nfar, and scolds them for not announcing their plans beforehand, so that\r\nproper preparations could be made. \"I beg you, my dear Wolfgang, to be\r\nmore thoughtful, and not to wait to write about things until they are\r\npast; otherwise all will go wrong.\" He points out how they have been\r\nliving hitherto almost entirely on hope, leaving to him the care of the\r\nmoney which they required; he had not even received the accounts which\r\nhis dear wife had promised him, and they had drawn money without giving\r\nhim proper notice:--\r\n\r\nA journey like this is no joke: you have not felt it hitherto. You must\r\nhave something more serious in your head than nonsense: you have to\r\nforesee, to consider, to calculate, or else you will find yourself in\r\na mess, without money--and no money means no friends, even if you give\r\nlessons a hundred times over, and compose sonatas, and play the fool\r\nevery night from ten to twelve o'clock. Ask these friends of yours\r\nfor credit! All the jokes will come to an end, and the most jocular\r\ncountenance will turn grave on a sudden.\r\n\r\nHereupon followed a very vague money account from the wife (December 11,\r\n1777):--\r\n\r\n{MOZART AND THE ELECTOR.}\r\n\r\n(395)\r\n\r\nMy dear Husband,--You wish to know what we have spent on our journey. We\r\nsent you Albert's bill, and the Augsburg one was thirty-eight florins.\r\nWolfgang has told you that we were twenty-four florins short, but he has\r\nnot included the expenses of the concert, which were sixteen florins,\r\nnor the hotel bill. So that when we came to Mannheim we had not more\r\nthan sixty gulden, and if we had left in a fortnight, there would not\r\nhave been much over. For travelling costs more, since things have grown\r\nso dear; it is not what it was--you would be surprised.\r\n\r\nThe irritated and somewhat despondent tone in which Wolfgang replied to\r\nhis father's reproaches (November 20, 1777), shows that he felt their\r\ntruth, and that the easy-going comfort of his life at Mannheim was\r\ndisturbed by the first indications of his duty:--\r\n\r\nIf you consider the cause of my inaction to be laziness and want of\r\ncare, then I can do nothing but thank you for your good opinion, and\r\nlament from my heart that my father does not know me better. I am\r\nnot careless, I am only resigned to everything, and so can wait with\r\npatience and bear all, provided my honour and my good name of Mozart do\r\nnot suffer. Well, if it must be, it must. But I pray you beforehand not\r\nto rejoice or to be sorry before it is time: for whatever happens it is\r\nall right if one is only healthy; happiness consists in the imagination\r\n(November 29, 1777).\r\n\r\nBut his father was not satisfied with all this moral philosophy, and\r\ncalmly criticises the saying that happiness consists in imagination as\r\nbeing worthy only of a wild herb. He calls upon his son to realise the\r\nsituation of being asked to pay, and having no money. \"My dear Wolfgang,\r\nthat is a saying fit for those who are satisfied with nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe negotiations with the Elector continued, and Wolfgang sought to\r\nenlighten his father concerning Cannabich's intentions and behaviour\r\n(November 29, 1777):--\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon (after the first interview with Savioli) I was at\r\nCannabich's, and, as it was by his advice that I had gone to the Count,\r\nhe asked me whether I had been. I told him all. He said, \"I should be\r\nvery glad if you remained with us all winter; but it would be still\r\nbetter if you could take service here altogether. I said, \"I could wish\r\nfor nothing better than to be always with you, but I do not see how\r\nthat is possible. You have two kapellmeisters already, and I could not\r\nconsent to come after Vogler.\" \"Nor need you,\" said he; \"no musician\r\nhere is under the kapellmeister, nor even under the manager. The\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(396)\r\n\r\nElector could appoint you his chamber composer. Just wait a little; I\r\nwill speak to the Count about it.\" The following Thursday was the state\r\nconcert; when the Count saw me he apologised for not having spoken,\r\nbut said he was waiting for Monday, when the Court would be over. I let\r\nthree days pass, and then, as I heard nothing, I went to inquire. He\r\nsaid, \"My dear Mons. Mozart [this was Friday, that is, yesterday],\r\nto-day the Elector went hunting, and I could not possibly ask him; but\r\nto-morrow at this time you shall certainly have an answer.\"\r\n\r\nI begged him not to forget. Truth to tell, I was a little annoyed when\r\nI came away, and I determined to take my easiest six variations on\r\nthe Fischer minuet (179 K.)--I had already copied them out for the\r\npurpose--to the young Count, that I might have an opportunity of\r\nspeaking to the Elector myself. When I brought them the governess could\r\nnot contain her delight. I was politely received; when I produced the\r\nvariations and said they were for the young Count, she said, \"O, you\r\nare very good; but have you nothing for the Countess?\" \"Not at present,\"\r\nsaid I; \"but, if I remain here long enough, I shall\"--\"_A propos_,\" she\r\nsaid, \"I am glad that you are to remain the winter here.\" \"Indeed!\r\n\r\nI did not know\"--\"That is curious. I am surprised. The Elector told me\r\nhimself.\" \"Well, if he has said it, I suppose it is so; for of course my\r\nstaying here depends on the Elector.\" I then told her the whole story.\r\nWe agreed that I should come to-morrow at four o'clock, and bring\r\nsomething for the Countess. She would speak to the Elector before I\r\ncame, and I should meet him there. I have been to-day, but he had not\r\nbeen there. I will go again to-morrow. I have a rondo for the Countess.\r\nNow, have I not reason enough to remain here and await the issue? Ought\r\nI to leave now that so important a step is taken? I have an opportunity\r\nof speaking to the Elector myself. I think I shall probably remain the\r\nwinter here, for the Elector likes me, thinks much of me, and knows what\r\nI can do. I hope to be able to give you good news in my next letter. I\r\nbeg you again not to sorrow or rejoice about it too soon, and to tell\r\nthe affair to no one but Herr Bullinger and my sister.\r\n\r\nBut the affair was not so easily settled; in his next letter (December\r\n3, 1777) Wolfgang could only tell his father of the many incidents which\r\nseemed to promise a good result:--\r\n\r\nLast Monday, after three successive attempts morning and afternoon, I\r\nwas fortunate enough to meet with the Elector. We all thought that our\r\ntrouble was again in vain, for it was getting late; but at last we saw\r\nhim coming. The governess at once placed the Countess at the clavier,\r\nand I sat near her, giving her a lesson: the Elector saw us so when he\r\nentered. We stood up, but he told us to continue. When she had finished\r\nplaying, the governess remarked that I had written a charming rondo for\r\nher. I played it, and he was highly pleased. Then he asked,\r\n\r\n{HOPES OF SERVICE AT MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(397)\r\n\r\n\"But will she be able to learn it?\" \"O yes,\" said I, \"I only wish that\r\nI could have the happiness of teaching it to her myself.\" He took snuff\r\nand said, \"I should like it, but would it not do her harm to have two\r\nmasters?\" \"Oh, no, your highness, it only signifies whether she has a\r\ngood or a bad one. I hope your highness would have no doubt--will have\r\nconfidence in me.\" \"Oh, certainly,\" said he. Then the governess said,\r\n\"M. Mozart has also written variations on Fischer's minuet for the young\r\nCount. I played them, and he was again very pleased. Then he began to\r\nplay with the children, and I thanked him for the presentation watch. He\r\nsaid, \"Well, I will think about it. How long shall you remain here?\"\r\n\"As long as your highness commands. I have no engagement elsewhere.\"\r\nAnd that was all. This morning I was there again, and was told that the\r\nElector had said several times last night that Mozart would remain\r\nall winter. Now that it has gone so far I must wait. To-day I dined at\r\nWendling's for the fourth time. Before dinner, Count Savioli came in\r\nwith the kapellmeister Schweitzer, who arrived yesterday. Savioli said\r\nco me, \"I have spoken several times to the Elector, but he has not yet\r\nmade up his mind.\" I told him I should like to say a word to him, and we\r\nwent to the window. I told him the doubts of the Elector, complained\r\nof being kept waiting so long, and begged him to induce the Elector to\r\nengage me; only I feared, I said, that he would offer me so little that\r\nI should not be able to remain. Let him give me work: I wanted work. He\r\npromised to do as I asked--it may be this evening, since he does not go\r\nto court to-day; but to-morrow he has promised me a decided answer. Now,\r\nlet what may happen, I shall be content. If he does not keep me, I\r\nshall ask for a parting gift, for I do not intend to make the Elector a\r\npresent of the rondo and the variations. I assure you I take the affair\r\nquite composedly, knowing that all will be for the best, as, come what\r\nmay, I have resigned myself to the will of God.\r\n\r\nBut for several days yet no answer could be obtained from the Elector\r\nexcept a shrug of the shoulders, and \"I have not made up my mind.\" At\r\nlast Mozart was able to acquaint his father with the result of all\r\nthese negotiations; it was such as L. Mozart had expected from the first\r\n(December 10, 1777):--\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to be done with the Elector at present. The day before\r\nyesterday I went to the concert at court to get my answer. Count Savioli\r\navoided me as long as he could, but I went up to him, and when he saw me\r\nhe shrugged his shoulders. \"What!\" said I, \"no answer yet?\" \"A thousand\r\npardons,\" said he; \"but, unfortunately, nothing can be done.\" \"Eh bien!\"\r\nI answered, \"the Elector might have told me that sooner.\" \"Yes,\" said\r\nhe, \"he would not have made up his\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(398)\r\n\r\nmind now if I had not urged him to it, and represented to him how long\r\nyou had been waiting already, and spending your money at the hotel.\"\r\n\"That annoys me most of all,\" I answered; \"it is not at all well\r\ndone. But I am exceedingly obliged to you, Count (he is not called\r\nExcellency), for your endeavours on my behalf, and I shall be obliged if\r\nyou will thank the Elector in my name for his gracious, though somewhat\r\ntardy, intelligence, and assure him that, if it had pleased him to\r\nengage me, he would not have repented doing so.\" \"O,\" said he, \"I am\r\nmore sure of that than you believe.\"\r\n\r\nThe unexpected turn of affairs made quite as unpleasant an impression\r\nupon the Mannheim circle of friends as upon Mozart. He went at once to\r\nCannabich's, and he being out hunting, related the whole story to his\r\nwife:--\r\n\r\nWhen Mdlle. Rose--who was three rooms off and busied with the linen--had\r\nfinished, she came in and said to me, \"Is it your pleasure that we\r\nbegin?\" for it was time for a lesson. \"I am at your service,\" said I.\r\n\"We will have a good steady lesson to-day,\" said she. \"We will indeed,\"\r\nI answered, \"for it will not last much longer.\" \"How so? Why?\" She went\r\nto her mamma, who told her. \"What!\" said she, \"is it really true? I do\r\nnot believe it.\" \"Yes, yes; quite true,\" said I. She played my sonata\r\nthrough quite seriously; believe me, I could not refrain from weeping;\r\nand before it was ended there were tears in the eyes of the mother and\r\ndaughter, and of Herr Schatzmeister, who was present, for the sonata was\r\na favourite with the whole house. \"You see,\" said Schatzmeister, \"when\r\nHerr Kapellmeister [they always call me so] goes away, he makes us all\r\ncry.\" I must say that I have made good friends here, and one learns to\r\nknow them under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nWendling was specially concerned at the intelligence; when Mozart\r\ncommunicated it he grew \"quite red,\" and said very hastily, \"We must\r\nfind some way of keeping you here, at all events for the two months\r\nbefore we go to Paris together.\" When Wolfgang went to dine with\r\nhim next day he made him what seemed a very satisfactory proposal. A\r\nDutchman (Dejean or Dechamps) nicknamed the Nabob, who lived on his\r\nmeans, and had been a friend and admirer of Wolfgang, offered to give\r\nhim 200 florins for three short and easy concertos and two quartets\r\nfor the flute; then Cannabich would guarantee at least two well-paying\r\npupils, and Mozart was to have duets for clavier and violin printed by\r\nsubscription. Wendling offered him board, and he could\r\n\r\n{L. MOZART'S ANXIETIES.}\r\n\r\n(399)\r\n\r\nhave free quarters at the house of the chamberlain Serrarius. Mozart\r\nwas rejoiced at the prospect of being able to remain in Mannheim, and\r\nthought he should have enough to do for all winter in composing three\r\nconcertos, two quartets, four or six clavier duets, besides a grand\r\nmass, which he intended to present to the Elector. The following day he\r\nset himself to find small, cheap lodgings for his mother, which was not\r\nan easy matter.\r\n\r\nIt was a satisfaction to Wolfgang's father, who was not surprised that\r\nWendling should seek to retain so excellent a fourth party for the\r\nexpedition to Paris, to have the state of affairs laid clearly before\r\nhim. He stipulated only that the journey should not take place during\r\nthe cold of winter, and thought the plan feasible, provided the Dutchman\r\ncould be relied on; if not, they must at once proceed to Mayence. But on\r\nno account were the mother and son to separate. \"As long as your mother\r\nremains, you must remain with her,\" he writes (December 18, 1777); \"you\r\nmust not think of leaving your mother to the care of others as long as\r\nyou and she can be together.\" The small difference in rent was not worth\r\nconsidering, and it was impossible for her to go home at present. \"Be\r\nmost careful to remain with your mother and care for her, even as she\r\nhas cared for you.\" It was not only physical care that he had in his\r\nmind, but watchfulness over his son's moral and religious behaviour. He\r\nexpresses some anxiety on these points (December 15).\r\n\r\nLet me ask you whether Wolfgang has not forgotten to go to confession\r\nlately? God before everything! From Him alone can we expect earthly\r\nhappiness and eternal safety. Young people are apt to be impatient when\r\ntold this; I know it, for I have been young myself; but, God be praised,\r\nI never failed to come to myself in time after any youthful folly, to\r\nflee from all danger to my soul, and to keep God and my honour, and the\r\ndangerous consequences of sin, always before my eyes.\r\n\r\nHis wife reassured him by saying that Wolfgang had confessed at the\r\nfeast of the Immaculate Conception, and that they had heard mass\r\nregularly on Sundays, though not always on week-days. Wolfgang justified\r\nhimself, not without a touch of irritability (December 20, 1777):--\r\n\r\nMANNHEIM.\r\n\r\n(400)\r\n\r\nI have written that your last letter gave me great pleasure, and that is\r\ntrue; but one part of it vexed me a little--the question whether I had\r\nnot somewhat neglected confession. I have nothing to reply to this,\r\nexcept to make you one request, which is--not to think so ill of\r\nme again. I am fond of fun, but be assured that I can be serious on\r\noccasion. Since I left Salzburg (and even before) I have met with people\r\nwhose speech and actions I should have been ashamed to imitate, although\r\nthey were ten, twenty, or thirty years older than myself; so I beg you\r\nearnestly to have a better opinion of me.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the offer of Serrarius to afford lodging,\r\nfiring, and light to both mother and son, came very opportunely;\r\nWolfgang was to give lessons to his daughter in return. The mother was\r\nespecially pleased at the change, having been somewhat lonely at the\r\nhotel during Wolfgang's long absences. They had good beds, careful\r\nattendance, and she supped and spent the evenings with her hostess,\r\nchatting with her often until eleven o'clock. Wolfgang does not seem\r\nto have been particularly struck with the talent of the daughter of the\r\nhouse, Theresa Pierron, who had played the clavier since she was eight\r\nyears old; he seldom mentions the \"house nymph.\" Nevertheless, she\r\npractised one of his concertos, and performed it at a large musical\r\nparty at home; and afterwards she played the third and easiest of his\r\nconcertos for three claviers at a concert. Before his departure from\r\nMannheim he composed (March 11, 1778) a clavier sonata with violin\r\naccompaniment for her (296 K.). He gave lessons in composition to young\r\nDanner, in return for which his mother dined there every day; he himself\r\nboarded at Wendling's. \"Wolfgang,\" writes his mother, \"has so much to\r\ndo with composing and giving lessons that he has no time to pay visits\r\nto anybody. So you see that we can comfortably stay here during the\r\nwinter; and it is all Herr Wendling's doing; he loves Wolfgang as his\r\nown son.\" Wolfgang himself gives his father the following account of his\r\ndaily life (December 20, 1777):--\r\n\r\nWe cannot rise before eight o'clock, for our room, being on the\r\nground-floor, is not light until half-past eight. Then I dress quickly;\r\nat ten o'clock I set to work composing until twelve or half-past; then\r\nI go to Wendling's and write a little more until half-past one, when we\r\ndine. At three, I go to give lessons in gallantry and thorough-bass to a\r\nDutch\r\n\r\n{SCHWEITZER'S \"ROSAMUNDE.\"}\r\n\r\n(401)\r\n\r\nofficer (De la Potrie), for which, if I do not mistake, I shall have\r\nfour ducats for twelve lessons. At four I return home to give a lesson\r\nto the daughter of the house: but we never begin before half-past four,\r\nbecause we are waiting for lights. At six I go to Cannabich's and teach\r\nMdlle. Rose; I stay there to supper, and then we talk or play a little,\r\nor some-times I take a book out of my pocket and read, as I used to do\r\nat Salzburg.\r\n\r\nHis mother had reason to say that Wolfgang was so busy he did not know\r\nwhich way to turn; and she might well add that her husband could not\r\nconceive how highly Wolfgang was esteemed for his music and other\r\nthings, so that every one said that he had not his equal, and his\r\ncompositions were literally idolised. At the same time the father is\r\ninformed that Wolfgang's beard has to be removed; and on his question\r\nas to whether it has been cut, burnt, or shaved off, the answer is duly\r\ngiven: \"The beard has not been shaved yet, only cut with scissors; but\r\nit cannot be done so any more, and next time the barber must be called\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nThe great musical event which was engrossing public attention at\r\nthis time was the approaching production of Wieland and Schweitzer's\r\n\"Rosamunde.\"\r\n\r\nAs the result of flattering overtures made to him during the summer of\r\n1776,[85] Wieland set to work on his text in the spring of 1777.[86]\r\nThe subject--a curious one to choose for Mannheim, where the Elector\r\nhad many Rosamunds, and the Electress took little pains to conceal her\r\nchagrin thereat (facts of which Wieland had no suspicion)[87]--inspired\r\nhim with the greatest enthusiasm. This caused him to be all the more\r\nunpleasantly surprised when Jacobi and Goethe declared the opera a\r\nfailure, and the minister Hompesch pressed for a revision of the last\r\nact. He wished to withdraw it altogether, although Schweitzer had\r\nalready composed three acts of great beauty; but Hompesch would on\r\nno account consent to this, and he was obliged to undertake the\r\nrevision.[88]\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(402)\r\n\r\nWieland was far from being satisfied with his own share of the opera,\r\nbut he declared that Schweitzer had produced a work which would attract\r\npeople for miles round to hear it.[89]\r\n\r\nWieland was invited to assist in person at the production of his\r\nopera. Dissatisfaction with the work, and domestic and economical\r\nconsiderations, caused him some hesitation; but the wish once more to\r\nenjoy music to the full finally prevailed, and he looked forward with\r\npleasure to a meeting with old friends; Jacobi, Sophie la Roche and\r\nher daughter, and Max Brentano promised to come to Mannheim for the\r\noccasion. The production of the opera had been first fixed for the\r\nfête-day of the Elector (November 4, 1777), but owing to the delay\r\ncaused by the revision it did not appear until January, 1778. When all\r\nthe preparations, the splendid scenery and costumes were completed,\r\nSchweitzer came to Mannheim to conduct the final rehearsals himself.\r\nMozart, who made his acquaintance at once, found him a good, honest man,\r\nbut dry and positive like Michael Haydn, \"only that his language is more\r\nrefined (December 3, 1777). \"There are beautiful things in the new opera,\r\nand I doubt not that it will succeed. 'Alceste' was a success, and is\r\nnot half so fine as 'Rosamunde.' Certainly its being the first German\r\nopera had much to do with the success; and now that the novelty has worn\r\noff it has ceased to make the same impression.\" The opera was rehearsed\r\ndaily, and it affords proof of the esteem in which Wolfgang was held by\r\nthe band that, when Schweitzer was unwell, he had \"to take his place,\r\nand conduct the opera with several of the violins at Wendling's\"\r\n(December 18, 1777). Repeated hearing of the opera did not increase\r\nMozart's admiration for it. \"Wolfgang does not care for the new opera,\"\r\nwrites his mother (December 18, 1777), \"he says there is no nature in\r\nit, and much exaggeration, and that it is not well written for the\r\nsingers; we must wait to see what effect it will produce.\" He writes\r\nhimself (December 10, 1777): \"'Rosamunde' was rehearsed at the theatre\r\nto-day; it is--good, but nothing more; and if it were bad, could it not\r\nbe performed just the same?\"\r\n\r\n{WIELAND AT MANNHEIM,}\r\n\r\n(403)\r\n\r\nLater on (September 11, 1778), he pities Aloysia Weber on account of\r\nher poor part in \"Rosamunde.\" \"She has one song, which might be made\r\nsomething of, but the voice part is _à la_ Schweitzer, like the barking\r\nof dogs; she has a kind of rondo in the second act, which allows her to\r\nsustain her voice, and display it a little. Woe to the vocalist, male or\r\nfemale, who falls into Schweitzer's hands! He will never acquire the art\r\nof writing for the voice.\"[90]\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Wieland, who was esteemed before all German poets at\r\nMannheim,[91] was eagerly looked for by the public, and Wolfgang looked\r\nforward to making his acquaintance. Wieland arrived on December 21, and\r\nwas equally delighted with his reception by the Elector and with the\r\nhomage of the populace. \"Every one is anxious to have me, and each\r\nday is distinguished by something which makes the remembrance of it\r\npleasant,\" he writes on December 26 to Sophie la Roche;[92] and to Merck\r\non the following day:[93] \"I can say nothing more than that I am well\r\nboth in soul and body, for the reason that I have to play no part but\r\nthe one natural to me, and that my affairs, so far as it appears,\r\nare prospering. God grant that I may not grow _too happy_ among these\r\npeople. But that is provided against.\"\r\n\r\nMozart was not carried away by the universal enthusiasm for the\r\ncelebrated poet, and sends his father the following impartial\r\ndescription (December 27, 1777):--\r\n\r\nI have made the acquaintance of Herr Wieland, but he does not know me as\r\nwell as I know him, for he has not heard me play yet. He is not at\r\nall what I had expected to find him. His speech seems to me somewhat\r\naffected; he has a childish voice--a fixed stare--a certain scholarlike\r\nbluntness, and yet sometimes a stupid condescension. I am not surprised\r\nat anything in his behaviour here, whatever it may be in Weimar\r\n\r\nMANNHEIM.\r\n\r\n(404)\r\n\r\nor elsewhere, for the people look at him as if he had come down from\r\nheaven. Every one yields to him, and there is silence directly he opens\r\nhis mouth. It is only a pity that he keeps people in suspense so long,\r\nfor he has a defect in his utterance, and has to speak very slowly, and\r\nstop every six words. He is extremely ugly, covered with pockmarks, and\r\nwith a very long nose. His height is somewhat greater than your own.\r\n\r\nAfter Wieland had learnt to know Mozart also, he writes (January 10,\r\n1778): \"Herr Wieland, after hearing me twice, is quite enchanted. The\r\nlast time he paid me all manner of compliments, ending up with, 'It\r\nhas been a real happiness to me to meet you here!' and a squeeze of the\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\nWieland was delighted with Wendling, and all the preparations for the\r\nopera were found satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe first performance was fixed for January 11, and he hoped to obtain\r\nmuch honour for his \"Rosamunde\" in Mannheim, if only the illness of the\r\nElector of Bavaria did not frustrate all his hopes. But this fear was\r\nunhappily realised. The Elector Maximilian died on December 30; the\r\nintelligence reached Mannheim as Karl Theodor was attending a religious\r\nservice for the New Year, and the following evening he set out for\r\nMunich.[94] All the festivities came to an end. \"The death of Maximilian\r\nJoseph,\" writes Wieland to Baron von Gebler (January 5, 1778), \"has\r\ndisappointed both myself and the public. My opera \"Rosamunde,\" set to\r\nadmirable music by Herr Schweitzer, was to have been given for the first\r\ntime on the 11th, and repeated eight times during the carnival. I had\r\nevery prospect of as great a success as perhaps an opera ever had, when\r\nthe death of the Elector of Bavaria brought about an alteration on the\r\nstage of public events, the lugubrious decorations of which have quite\r\nsuppressed mine.\"[95] The opera was rehearsed once more in his honour,\r\nand then he travelled back to Weimar, content with the result of his\r\nvisit, though his main object was defeated.[96]\r\n\r\nThe change of government had more lasting effects for\r\n\r\n{PROSPECTS OF WORK IN VIENNA.}\r\n\r\n(405)\r\n\r\nMannheim, and especially for the musicians there, than a mere temporary\r\nsuspension of gaiety. The patriotic inhabitants of the Palatinate could\r\nnot indeed believe that their Elector would transfer his capital to\r\nMunich;[97] but the prospects of the future were uncertain and alarming,\r\nowing to the threatening turn taken by political events.\r\n\r\nIf Mozart had felt himself moved to write German operas in Munich, the\r\nimpulse must have been vastly strengthened by his stay in Mannheim. He\r\nhad offered his services to the Elector with this object. When the offer\r\nwas declined, a new prospect was opened to him in Vienna, with which he\r\nacquaints his father (January 11, 1778):[98]--\r\n\r\nI know for certain that the Emperor is thinking of establishing\r\nopera in Vienna, and that he is seeking everywhere for a young\r\nkapellmeister, a German and a genius, who is capable of producing\r\nsomething new.[99] Benda is seeking in Gotha, but Schweitzer has more\r\ninfluence. This would be just the thing for me; well paid, of course. If\r\nthe Emperor gives me 1,000 florins I will write him an opera, and if he\r\ndoes not pay me it is all the same. Pray write to all imaginable friends\r\nin Vienna that I am in a position to serve the Emperor. If needs be, he\r\nmay try me with an opera, and what he does after, I really do not care.\r\nAdieu. I hope you will put the affair in motion at once, or some one may\r\nbe beforehand with me.\r\n\r\nL. Mozart was not the man to let this opportunity slip. He applied at\r\nonce to Heufeld, who had formerly been well disposed towards them, and\r\nwhose knowledge and influence could be relied on, begging him to exert\r\nhimself on Wolfgang's behalf. Letters from Messmer (pp. 86,145) had\r\njust arrived from Vienna, asking why Wolfgang did not come to Vienna,\r\nwhere there was \"always room for true talent.\" He should have board and\r\nlodging with him as long as he liked, and his friends would see to his\r\ninterests. But the prospects, so far as the opera was concerned, were\r\nnot very promising. L. Mozart was of opinion (January 29, 1778)\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(406)\r\n\r\nthat the Emperor was like the Archbishop--\"he wanted a good thing at\r\na very cheap rate.\" A letter from Heufeld was definitive (January 23,\r\n1778):--\r\n\r\nIt is true that His Majesty the Emperor, to whom his mother has quite\r\nresigned the care of the theatre, wishes to establish German opera. All\r\norders come through the High Chamberlain, Count von Rosenberg, to the\r\ncompany, among whom there is a sort of council for the regulation of the\r\npieces and parts. At the opera, which is now combined with the national\r\ncompany,\" the additional singers are Mdlle. Cavalieri, and Schindler's\r\ndaughter, married to Langin, with a bass, whose name I forget (Fuchs).\r\nTo-day was the first rehearsal of the first opera (\"Die Bergknappen\"),\r\nof which Herr Weidmann has furnished the words, and Herr Umlauf, who\r\nplays the viola in the orchestra, the music. The performance will take\r\nplace shortly. All this is only an experiment to see if anything can be\r\ndone with the Germans in this line. It is certain that no composer will\r\nbe engaged at present, particularly as Gluck and Salieri are in the\r\nEmperor's service. To recommend any one at present would be the surest\r\nway to failure; and no advocate can be employed to reach the Emperor's\r\near, since he arranges everything himself according to his own ideas and\r\ninclinations. Every one knows this, and no one ventures on a proposal or\r\nrecommendation. His Majesty has sought out Gluck and Salieri, and most\r\nof those who are now in his service, in the same way. I could give you\r\nseveral examples of people who have applied indirectly to His Majesty\r\nand have failed in their suit. The way in which you propose approaching\r\nhim seems to me far from good, and the reason I decline presenting a\r\npetition is my certain conviction that it would be useless, and, indeed,\r\nprejudicial to your interests. There is another more creditable and more\r\ncertain way open to first-rate talent, and that is the production of\r\nsome work, for which there is every opportunity. Let your son take the\r\ntrouble of setting any good German opera to music and submitting it to\r\nthe supreme pleasure of the Emperor, and then let him wait the event,\r\nand follow in person if his work is well received. In this case, indeed,\r\nhis presence will be necessary. Your son may be without any apprehension\r\nwith regard to Benda and Schweitzer; I can answer for there being no\r\ntrouble from that quarter. Their fame is not so great here as elsewhere.\r\nPerhaps even Wieland's great opinion of these gentlemen[100] has\r\nsomewhat abated since his stay at Mannheim. I have a letter of the 5th\r\ninst. from him, in which he acknowledges to having received altogether\r\nnew ideas upon music in Mannheim.\r\n\r\n{OVERTURES FROM THE ARCHBISHOP.}\r\n\r\n(407)\r\n\r\nWhen this letter reached Mozart he was in a very excited state (the\r\nreason for which will be presently noted), and the effect it produced\r\nwas greater than mere disappointment. His self-love, which had been\r\nraised to so high a pitch by the appreciation of his Mannheim admirers,\r\nwas wounded by the proposal that he should write a comic opera on\r\napproval, like a beginner. Even the condescending good nature of Heufeld\r\nto his \"dear Wolfgang\" increased his annoyance.\r\n\r\nHis father was full of plans and cares for his son's advancement. An\r\nopportunity which offered for a settlement in Salzburg was little likely\r\nto please Wolfgang. The city had been thrown into consternation on\r\nDecember 21, 1777, by the paralytic seizure of Adlgasser while he was\r\nplaying the organ. His death followed the same evening. It soon became\r\nclear that Wolfgang's return and application for the vacant post would\r\nnot be unacceptable to the authorities; and his father informs him of\r\nseveral hints he had received to that effect (January 12, 1778):--\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Lord High Steward apprised me that his Serene\r\nHighness had commanded him to inquire from Haydn and myself if we knew\r\nof a really good organist; he must also be an excellent clavier player,\r\nof good appearance and manners, and able to give lessons to the ladies\r\nof the court. \"What!\" said I, \"did his Serene Highness mention me?\"\r\n\"Yes; you in particular,\" said he, and laughed. I said, \"I know nobody\r\nwith all these qualities.\" If there is such an one in Mannheim, he may\r\nmake his fortune.\r\n\r\nBut even if his father had been willing to take these hints, Wolfgang\r\nwould have had no ear for them.\r\n\r\nWith the idea that a longer stay in Mannheim might yet result in a\r\npermanent engagement, L. Mozart wrote to the Padre Martini in December,\r\n1777, sending him Wolfgang's promised portrait, and begging him to use\r\nall his influence with the Elector.[101] With his usual good nature, the\r\nPadre promised to write to Raaff authorising him to say to the Elector\r\n\"in his name everything imaginable in Wolfgang's\r\n\r\nMANNHEIM.\r\n\r\n(408)\r\n\r\nfavour, and to praise him according to his deserts; even if the\r\npolitical situation should operate unfavourably at the moment, the\r\nappeal would certainly bear fruit at a future time.\" No such letter,\r\nhowever, reached Raaff from Padre Martini; but Wolfgang made it the\r\noccasion of forming a closer acquaintance with Raaff, and advancing his\r\nown claims. He writes (February 28, 1778):--\r\n\r\nYesterday I took Raaff a song which I had just written for him. The\r\nwords are \"Se al labro mio non credi, bella nemica mia,\" &c. I do not\r\nthink they are Metastasio's. The song pleases him greatly. One has to go\r\ncarefully to work with a man like this. I selected the words with care,\r\nbecause I knew that he had sung them before, and that they would come\r\neasier and more pleasantly to him. I asked him to tell me candidly if\r\nhe did not care for them or like them, and I would alter the song to\r\nhis pleasure, or write it over again. \"Heaven forbid!\" said he, \"let\r\nthe song remain as it is, for it is very fine; only I must beg you to\r\nshorten it a little, for I have lost the power now of sustaining my\r\nvoice so long.\" \"Willingly,\" said I; \"as much as you please. I took care\r\nto make it long, for it is much easier to curtail than to lengthen a\r\nsong.\" After he had sung the second part, he took off his spectacles,\r\nlooked hard at me, and said, \"Beautiful, beautiful! That is a charming\r\nsecond part,\" and he sang it three times. When I went away, he thanked\r\nme cordially, and I assured him in return that I would arrange the song\r\nto his satisfaction. I like a song to be fitted to the singer, like a\r\nwell-made garment.[102]\r\n\r\nThe aria (295 K.), without the introductory recitative, has the\r\nfollowing words:--\r\n\r\n     Se al labro mio non credi,\r\n     Bella nemica mia,\r\n     Aprimi il petto e vedi,\r\n     Quai sia 1' amante cor;\r\n     Il cor dolente e afflito\r\n     Ma d' ogni colpa privo,\r\n     Se pur non è delitto\r\n     Un innocente ardor.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is more strictly orthodox than had latterly been usual\r\nwith Mozart, apparently out of consideration to the singer. The first\r\npart is an elaborate adagio, full of\r\n\r\n{PREPARATIONS FOR PARIS.}\r\n\r\n(409)\r\n\r\nsimple melody and fervent expression; the tone of deep sorrow given to\r\nthe words \"aprimi il petto\" is very impressive, melodious and pleasing,\r\nwith few passages, and those not florid. The second part (allegretto,\r\n3-8, in G minor), is especially rhythmical and original in its\r\nharmonies, animated, and full of expression. Although the arrangement of\r\nthis part is quite in the old style, it has decided individuality, and\r\ncontrasts so effectively with the adagio that one can easily understand\r\nthe delight with which it inspired the old singer. The song does not\r\nexceed the compass of--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nand keeps to the position of the tenor voice proper, full opportunity\r\nfor effective display being afforded to the singer. The free and finely\r\ncoloured accompaniment never obscures the voice,[103] and the whole song\r\nis not inferior to later and better known works.\r\n\r\nThe time had now arrived for the expedition to Paris, and Mozart's\r\nanxious father was unsparing in thought and wise counsel. He advised\r\nthem to prepare in good time for the mother's journey from Mannheim to\r\nAugsburg at the beginning of March, and he impressed upon Wolfgang that\r\nhis stay in Paris was not to be limited by weeks or months, but was to\r\nlast until he had gained both fame and money; he must therefore wind\r\nup all his affairs in Mannheim before he left. His father also gave\r\nhim circumstantial rules for his guidance in society; he was to avoid\r\nintimacies, especially with other composers, such as Gluck, Piccinni,\r\nand Grétry, whose rivalry might be feared, \"de la politesse, et pas\r\nd'autre chose!\" He was above all to observe the greatest prudence in his\r\ndealings with the female sex, who were always on the watch for young men\r\nof great talent whom they might dupe and entangle, or even marry; \"that\r\nwould be my death,\" says his father, and he sends him a long list\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(410)\r\n\r\nof their patrons during their former stay, whom he was to seek out\r\nimmediately on his arrival. He is especially assured of the tried\r\nfriendship of Grimm, and of his own studies and duties: \"Think daily\r\nwhat you owe to God, who has given you such extraordinary talents.\"\r\n\r\nTo L. Mozart's astonishment he received a letter from Wolfgang (February\r\n4, 1778), informing him of his intention of giving up the journey to\r\nParis, and of the reasons which had led to this determination:--\r\n\r\nMamma and I have talked it over, and agreed that the life which Wendling\r\nleads does not suit us. Wendling is a thoroughly honest, good man, but\r\nhe and all his household are totally without religion; his daughter's\r\nrelations to the Elector sufficiently prove this.[104] Ramm is good\r\nat heart, but a libertine. I know myself, and know that I have so much\r\nreligion that I should never commit an action that I could not proclaim\r\nto the whole world; but the mere thought of travelling with people whose\r\nway of thinking is so opposed to mine (and to that of all honourable\r\nmen) frightens me. They may do as they please, but I have no wish to\r\naccompany them; I should not have a happy hour, I should never know what\r\nI was saying; for, in one word, I have no confidence in them. Friendship\r\nwithout a religious basis is not lasting. I have already given them a\r\nlittle _prægusto_. I have told them that letters have reached me, of\r\nwhich I can say nothing further than that they interfere with my journey\r\nto Paris with them; I may be able to follow, but perhaps I shall have to\r\ngo elsewhere, and they must not depend upon me.\r\n\r\nThe mother corroborates all this, and declares she had never approved of\r\nthe society of Wendling and Ramm, but that she had said nothing, for\r\nshe was never listened to. In her next letter she asserts that it\r\nwould certainly be dangerous companionship for Wolfgang, and tells her\r\nhusband: \"It is true that Herr Wendling is the best-natured man in the\r\nworld, but neither he nor his family have any idea of religion, nor\r\ncare for it; neither the mother nor daughter enter a church all the year\r\nround, nor do they ever confess nor hear mass, but they are always going\r\nto the play; they say the church is not healthy.\"\r\n\r\nL. Mozart was not a little surprised that his wife and son\r\n\r\n{WOLFGANG'S WISH TO REMAIN IN MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(411)\r\n\r\nshould so suddenly discover this lack of faith at the end of a long\r\nacquaintance. \"You are quite right not to travel in undesirable\r\ncompany,\" he answers (February 16, 1778); \"but you must have been aware\r\nof the bad qualities of these men for a long time, and you have had so\r\nlittle confidence in your anxious father, that you have never written to\r\nask his advice on the subject, and (shocking!) neither has your mother\r\ndone so.\" There was not much to be said in answer to this, except that\r\nthey had allowed themselves to be deceived by the universal praise of\r\nWendling, and by his really good qualities, and had overlooked his want\r\nof religion.\r\n\r\nWolfgang gave his father other reasons against the expedition (February\r\n7, 1778):--\r\n\r\nI have already given you my chief reason for not going with these people\r\nto Paris. The second is that I cannot quite see what I should have to do\r\nin Paris. My only means of advancement would be lesson-giving, and that\r\nwork is distasteful to me. I have had a striking example of that here.\r\nI might have had two pupils. I went to each of them three times, then\r\nI found one of them out; consequently I did not go again. I will gladly\r\ngive lessons as a favour, particularly to any one who shows genius and\r\na real wish to learn. But to be obliged to go to a house at a certain\r\nhour, or to be obliged to wait at home for a pupil, is what I cannot do,\r\neven if it were to bring me some profit. I leave that to those who\r\ncan do nothing but play the clavier. I am a composer, and a born\r\nkapellmeister; I ought not to bury my talent for composition which a\r\nmerciful God has so richly bestowed upon me (I may say it without pride,\r\nfor I feel it now more than ever); and pupils are most distracting\r\nto the mind. I would rather (so to speak) neglect the clavier than\r\ncomposition; for the clavier is only a subordinate affair; only, God be\r\npraised! a very powerful subordinate.\r\n\r\nHe had said the same to Wendling, and told him that if he would only\r\nput something certain in his way, he would gladly follow to Paris,\r\n\"especially if it was an opera; opera-writing is my chief idea and\r\nobject, French rather than German, but Italian rather than either\r\nFrench or German. Wendling and his friends are all of opinion that my\r\ncompositions would be wonderfully successful in Paris; for, as you know,\r\nI can adapt myself to every sort and style of composition.\"\r\n\r\nAll things considered, we cannot but feel that Wolfgang's\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(412)\r\n\r\nfather was justified in writing as follows (February 23, 1778)\r\n\r\nSo you intend only to give lessons as a favour, do you? and you mean to\r\nleave your old father in his present straits? For a young fellow like\r\nyou lesson-giving is far too much trouble, even when it is well paid.\r\nIt is more fitted to your old father to run from house to house for a\r\nwretched pittance in order to support himself and his daughter, and to\r\nsend the little that remains to you, instead of paying his debts; and\r\nall that you may amuse yourself by giving lessons to some silly girl for\r\nnothing! My son, reflect, and give ear to your own good sense. Reflect\r\nwhether you do not deal more hardly with me than our prince himself. God\r\nhas given you an excellent judgment, and two things only hinder you from\r\nemploying it on your own affairs: first, a trifle too much of conceit\r\nand self-love, and, secondly, an inclination to be over-confiding and to\r\nopen your heart to every one you meet.\r\n\r\nHe made him easy as to lesson-giving in Paris (February 16, 1778)\r\n\r\nIn the first place, no one will discharge his master at once in order to\r\ntake you; and, in the second place, no one would venture to engage you,\r\nnor should you take any one, except a lady, now and then, who plays well\r\nalready and has a fancy for learning from you, for which she is willing\r\nto pay well. Such lady pupils as these will take endless trouble to\r\ncollect subscriptions for your compositions. The ladies in Paris are\r\nomnipotent; they are great amateurs of the clavier, and many of\r\nthem play extremely well. They would be your best allies for getting\r\ncommissions; and you will be able, by their help, to make both fame\r\nand money with clavier pieces, violin quartets, symphonies, and such\r\ncollections of French songs with the clavier as you lately sent me;\r\nthen, at last, you will arrive at an opera. Why do you hesitate? But you\r\nalways want things done in a moment, before you have been either seen\r\nor heard. Look down the long list of our former acquaintances in Paris;\r\nthey are all, at least the greater number, the best people in the town.\r\nThey are all most anxious to see you again, and if only six of such\r\npersons (nay, a single one would suffice) were to take you by the hand,\r\nyou might do as you pleased.\r\n\r\nAll this notwithstanding, however, we cannot but feel that Wolfgang's\r\nconsciousness of his true vocation and his lively protest against any\r\nsort of pressure from without did honour to him, far more honour than\r\nthe insinuation of unbelief against his true friend Wendling, to whom\r\nhe was already deeply indebted. Not that Mozart was insincere--he was a\r\nfaithful son of his Church--but other feelings were at work\r\n\r\n{REPROACHES AND EXPLANATIONS.}\r\n\r\n(413)\r\n\r\nhere, which obscured his judgment. Wendling was inconsolable at\r\nWolfgang's refusal to join the party; and the latter endeavoured to\r\npersuade himself that motives of personal interest had a share in the\r\nregret of his friend. Be it as it may, Wendling and Ramm set off for\r\nParis on February 15, leaving Wolfgang at Mannheim, not quite free\r\nfrom compunction. \"If I thought,\" he writes to his father (February 14,\r\n1778), \"that you were really annoyed about my not going to Paris with\r\nthem, I should repent having remained here; but, after all, the road to\r\nParis is not closed to me.\"\r\n\r\nL. Mozart was not altogether displeased at the turn of affairs; what\r\nreally angered him was to hear from Wolfgang (February 4, 1778): \"I am\r\ngetting on at my ease with the music for Mons. de Jean, for which I am\r\nto have 200 florins; I can stay here as long as I like, for neither my\r\nboard nor lodging cost me anything.\" His father had warned him before\r\n(December 11, 1777): \"If you examine your conscience you will find\r\nthat you have a strong tendency to procrastination\"; and now he writes\r\n(February 12, 1778): \"I am astonished to hear that you are finishing\r\nMons. de Jean's music at your ease. Can it be that you have not already\r\ncompleted it! And you were thinking of leaving Mannheim on the 15th, and\r\nhave been making expeditions to Kirchheim? Well, never mind, only beware\r\nthat Herr Wendling and Mons. de Jean do not play you false, for the\r\nproposal was only made with the intention of enabling you to go with\r\nthem. Let me have an answer by the next post, that I may know how the\r\nmatter stands.\" The information which Wolfgang furnished (February 14,\r\n1778) was not consolatory:--\r\n\r\nHerr de Jean, who also goes to Paris to-morrow, has paid me only\r\nninety-six florins (miscalculating the half by four florins) because\r\nI had written only two concerti and three quartetti. But he will be\r\nobliged to pay me the whole, for I have arranged with Wendling to send\r\nthe music after them. It is not extraordinary that I should not have\r\nbeen able to finish it. I never have a quiet hour; night is my only time\r\nfor writing, for I cannot even get up early. Besides, one is not always\r\nin the humour for writing. I could certainly scribble away the whole\r\nday; but when a thing is to go forth to the world bearing my name, I am\r\ndetermined that\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(414)\r\n\r\nI will not be ashamed of it. You know how stupid I am when I have always\r\nto compose for one instrument (and that one which I dislike). I have\r\nwritten other things from time to time for a change, such as clavier\r\nduets and portions of masses. But now I have set to work in earnest on\r\nthe clavier duets, so that I may have them printed.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Paris (July 20, 1778) he mentions only \"two quartets\r\nfor the flute,\" and on October 3, 1778, he speaks of \"the flute\r\nconcerto.\" Two quartets for flute, violin, viola, and violoncello are\r\nknown. One of them (281 K.) is inscribed, \"Mannheim il 25 Dec., 1777,\"\r\nand must therefore be the same which is mentioned in the letter of\r\nDecember 18 as being almost finished. It is in D major, in the usual\r\nthree movements, the middle one, an adagio 3-8, being accompanied\r\nthroughout _pizzicato_, the flute leading the melody. The whole piece\r\nis easy, both in style and composition, the flute kept mainly in the\r\nforeground, and the accompanying parts firmly and skilfully handled,\r\nwithout any actual elaboration. The second quartet (298 K.), according\r\nto a notice appended by a strange hand to the original manuscript (in\r\nthe imperial library at Vienna), was composed in Paris in 1778. It is\r\nin A major, and begins with variations on a simple theme, in which each\r\ninstrument in succession comes in obbligato. Then follows a minuet, and\r\nas a finale a \"rondieaoux,\" the heading of which testifies to Mozart's\r\nmerry humour; it runs: \"Allegretto grazioso, ma non troppo presto, perö\r\nnon troppo adagio, cosi, cosi, con molto garbo ed espressione.\" It is\r\nlikewise easy in every respect, shorter, and somewhat fresher than the\r\nfirst movement. A flute concerto in D major (314 K.) bears much the same\r\ncharacter, and was composed for the \"true philanthropist, the Indian\r\nDutchman.\" It is lively and cheerful, without laying claim to deeper\r\nsignificance; the accompaniment, although kept well in hand, betrays in\r\nlittle touches the practised hand of a master. An andante in C major for\r\nthe flute, with orchestral accompaniment has also been preserved (315\r\nK.). The original is not dated, but the handwriting, the Mannheim paper,\r\nand the well-founded assumption that Mozart never wrote for the flute,\r\nexcept by commission, point to this time. Fürstenau, however, remarks\r\nthat Mozart treats the flute\r\n\r\n{THE FATHER'S DISAPPOINTMENT.}\r\n\r\n(415)\r\n\r\nwith a perfect knowledge of the instrument, its _technique_ and easily\r\nattained effects.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the mass on which he was engaged at Mannheim,\r\nunless a detached Kyrie in E flat (322 K.), serious and dignified in\r\nexpression, original and free in treatment, may be referred to this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nHe writes on the 28th February, 1778, that he has still two clavier\r\nsonatas to write: \"But I am not in a hurry with them, for they cannot\r\nbe printed here. Nothing can be done by subscription--it is beggary, and\r\nthe engraver will not take the risk on himself unless I promise him\r\nhalf the profits. I would rather have them printed in Paris, where the\r\npublishers are glad of something new, and pay capitally, and where much\r\nalso can be done by subscription.\" One of the sonatas (304 K.) was,\r\naccording to the inscription, finished in Paris; all the six were\r\npublished there in 1778 by Sieber, and were dedicated to the Electress\r\n(301-306 K.).\r\n\r\nWolfgang's dilatoriness was a hard blow to his father, who had counted\r\non the price of these compositions to cover the cost of the Mannheim\r\nvisit and of the journey to Paris. He saw plainly that he must not only\r\ndefray these himself, but must also provide for the future, and he found\r\nhimself in great perplexity. He writes in troubled strain (February 16,\r\n1778):--\r\n\r\nWe have tried every means to make you happy, and ourselves through you,\r\nand at least to set your future career on a firm foundation: but fate\r\nhas willed that we should not succeed. Our last venture has sunk me very\r\nlow indeed, and, as you know, I am now seven hundred florins in debt,\r\nknowing not how I am to support myself, your mother and sister, on my\r\nmonthly pay; not a kreuzer can I hope for from our prince. You cannot\r\nbut see clearly, therefore, that the future fate of your old parents,\r\nand of your good devoted sister, is in your hands.\r\n\r\nThe sister, an ever-present witness of the cares and perplexities of her\r\nfather, at a loss to know how the new year's bills were to be met, or\r\nhow he was to procure the new clothes he needed, grasped the state of\r\naffairs very thoroughly. She practised the clavier with redoubled zeal,\r\nand had made great efforts thoroughly to master thorough-bass and the\r\nart of preluding; she foresaw that after her father's death her\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(416)\r\n\r\nmusic would be her mother's and her own sole dependence. She was deeply\r\ngrieved at the bad news from Wolfgang, and \"had her full share of\r\nweeping.\" Wolfgang wrote crossly that she \"should not cry for nothing\"\r\n(February 19, 1778); but he must have felt ashamed of himself when his\r\nfather's answer to this came (February 26, 1778)\r\n\r\nShe did not cry over nothing when she cried over your letter; but,\r\nnevertheless, she said when she heard that you had not got the 200\r\nflorins, \"Thank God that it is no worse!\" although she has considerable\r\ninterest in the matter, and knows that, in order to go on helping you,\r\nher own just claims must be laid aside.\r\n\r\nAnd why was it, the father must have asked himself, that Wolfgang was\r\nso suddenly blind to his own interests, and forgetful of his duty to his\r\nfamily? It required no great skill in reading between the lines to find\r\nthe answer in his son's own letters. The stay in Mannheim influenced his\r\nartistic life through the intellectual atmosphere of a capital in which\r\nflourished German science and German art; but beyond and above this, it\r\nwas there that he was seized by the passion which sways the innermost\r\nbeing of man, and blunts for the time every other feeling. We have seen\r\nhow susceptible he always was to female charms, and how he delighted\r\nin intercourse with agreeable women, whose attractions often threw a\r\nfavourable light on his opinion of their musical acquirements.\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time, there awoke in his heart a passionate\r\nattachment to a young singer of extraordinary talent; the beauty of her\r\nvoice as it developed under his loving tuition, coupled with the unhappy\r\ncircumstances of her life, increased the young man's generous ardour,\r\nand aroused his lively sympathy. Aloysia Weber, the second daughter of a\r\nman in a subordinate position at the theatre,[105] was fifteen\r\n\r\n{MDLLE. WEBER.}\r\n\r\n(417)\r\n\r\nyears of age, and of great beauty. His letters, outwardly expressive\r\nonly of his admiration for her singing, are not the less indicative\r\nof the state of his heart; artistic delight and loving passion are\r\ncharmingly and unconsciously blended in every sentence. The view which\r\nit is permitted us to take of the innocent heart of a youth who\r\ncould feel as warmly and tenderly as he could judge impartially and\r\nartistically, is the more striking, since it helps us to apprehend how\r\nmuch was torn away with this bud, destined never to unfold into blossom.\r\nWolfgang first mentions her in an account of a little professional tour\r\n(January 17, 1778)\r\n\r\nNext Wednesday I am going for a few days to Kirchheim-Poland, to the\r\nPrincess of Orange (p. 43); I have heard so much that is good of her,\r\nthat at last I have decided. A Dutch officer, and my very good friend,\r\nwas dreadfully scolded by her for not bringing me with him, when he\r\nwent to pay his respects at the new year. I shall get at least eight\r\nlouis-d'or; for she is a great musical amateur, and I have had four\r\nsongs copied for her; I shall give her a symphony, too, for she has a\r\nnice little orchestra, and gives concerts every day.[106] The copying of\r\nthe songs will not cost me much, for it has been done by a certain Herr\r\nWeber, who is going over with me. He has a daughter of fifteen, who\r\nsings extremely well, with a beautiful, pure voice. She only wants\r\naction to be fit for a prima donna on any stage. Her father is a good,\r\ntrue-hearted German, who has brought up his children well, which is\r\nthe reason that the girl is persecuted here. He has six children, five\r\ndaughters and one son. For fourteen years he supported himself and\r\nhis family on 200 florins a year, and because he has always faithfully\r\nfulfilled his duties, and has provided the Elector with a first-rate\r\nsinger, he has now actually 400 florins. She sings my song for De Amicis\r\nwith the fearful passages excellently well (135 [11] K.); she is going\r\nto sing it at Kirchheim-Poland.\r\n\r\nAfter his return he narrates the particulars of this \"holi-day-trip\"\r\n(February 2, 1778)\r\n\r\nWe sent a note at once to the castle, and next day the concertmeister,\r\nRothfischer, waited on us. In the evening we went to the court, it being\r\nSaturday; Mdlle. Weber sang three songs. I pass over her singing with\r\none word, _excellent_. I spoke to you of her merits in my last letter,\r\nand I shall not be able to close this without saying more, as I am now\r\nlearning to know her better, and to appreciate her full powers.\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(418)\r\n\r\nAfterwards we supped at the officers' table. Sunday and Monday we dined\r\nat court; there was no music on Sunday evening; there never is, so that\r\nthey have only about 300 musical evenings in the year. We might have\r\njoined the gaming-table, but much preferred remaining at home. We would\r\nwillingly have dispensed with the dinner at court, since we are never\r\nso happy as when alone together; but we looked at it from an economical\r\npoint of view, having spent enough already. On Monday there was music,\r\nand again on Tuesday and Wednesday; Mdlle. Weber sang in all thirteen\r\ntimes, and twice played the clavier, which she does very well. What\r\nsurprises me most is her correctness. Only imagine, she played my\r\ndifficult sonatas slowly, but without missing a note, _prima vista_,\r\nupon my honour. I would rather she played my sonatas than Vogler. I\r\nhave played in all twelve times, and once by desire on the organ in the\r\nLutheran church, and I have waited on the Princess with four symphonies;\r\nfor all this I have received seven louis-d'ors in silver money, and my\r\npoor dear Weber five--basta! We have lost nothing by it. I have clear\r\nforty-two florins profit, and the inexpressible pleasure of having\r\nmade the acquaintance of true-hearted Catholic and Christian people. _A\r\npropos_, you must not be surprised that my seventy-seven florins have\r\nbeen reduced to forty-two florins. It was a true pleasure to come\r\ntogether with good sympathetic people. I could not do otherwise than pay\r\nhalf the expenses; but that will not happen on any other journey; I have\r\nsaid already I shall only pay for myself. Afterwards we stayed five\r\ndays at Worms, where Herr Weber has a brother-in-law, the Dean of the\r\nmonastery, who stands in fear of Herr Weber's sharp-pointed pen. We were\r\nvery merry, and dined and supped every day with the Dean. I can truly\r\nsay that this little journey has been good practice on the clavier for\r\nme. The Dean is a very wealthy, sensible man. Now it is time that I\r\nconclude; if I were to write all that I think I should run short of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nAfter his return to Mannheim he devoted almost his whole time to the\r\nWebers, and to the musical education of their gifted daughter. He\r\nstudied with her all the songs which he had brought, and begged his\r\nfather to send him from Salzburg \"an aria cantabile, cadenzas, and\r\nanything else suitable.\" Then he procured her an opportunity of being\r\nheard. He writes (February 14, 1778):--\r\n\r\nYesterday Cannabich gave a concert, and everything performed--except\r\nthe first symphony by Cannabich himself--was mine. Mdlle. Rose played my\r\nconcerto in B flat (238 K.); then, by way of a change, Herr Ramm played\r\nfor the fifth time my oboe concerto for Ferlendi, which has made a\r\ngreat sensation here; Ramm makes it his _cheval de bataille_. Afterwards\r\nMdlle. Weber sang De Amicis' _aria di bravura_ quite\r\n\r\n{\"NON SÒ D' ONDE VIENE.\"}\r\n\r\n(419)\r\n\r\ncharmingly. Then I played my old concerto in D (175 K.), because it\r\nis such a favourite here; then I improvised for half an hour, and\r\nafterwards Mdlle. Weber sang with great applause \"Parto m' affretto\"\r\n(\"Lucio Silla,\" 135 [16] K.). My overture to the \"Re Pastore\" was the\r\nfinale.\r\n\r\nHe had the satisfaction of hearing from Raaff, \"who certainly never\r\nflatters,\" when asked his true opinion: \"She sang like a professor, not\r\nlike a learner.\" As an expression of his feelings for Aloysia, Wolfgang\r\ncomposed the song (294 K.) which comes more direct from his heart than\r\nany other of his compositions (February 28, 1778):--\r\n\r\nI have taken the aria, \"Non sò d'onde viene,\" &c., as an exercise in\r\ncomposition, just because it has been so beautifully done by Bach, and\r\nbecause I know and admire his rendering so much that it is always in\r\nmy ears; I wanted to try whether, in spite of this, I could not write a\r\nsong which should not be like Bach's. It is not at all, not in the least\r\nlike. I intended the song for Raaff at first, but the beginning was\r\ntoo high, and it pleased me too much to be altered; besides, the\r\ninstrumentation seemed to make it more fitted for a soprano. I therefore\r\ndecided to write the song for Mdlle. Weber. I laid it aside, and set\r\nto work on \"Se al labro\" for Raaff. But it was of no use, I could write\r\nnothing else while the first song was in my head. So I finished it, and\r\nset myself to make it exactly suited to Mdlle. Weber. It is an andante\r\nsostenuto, following a short recitative. In the middle comes the second\r\npart, \"Nel seno a destarmi;\" then again the sostenuto. When it was\r\nfinished, I said to Mdlle. Weber, \"Learn the song for yourself; sing it\r\naccording to your own taste; then let me hear it, and I will tell you\r\ncandidly what pleases me and what does not please me.\" In two days she\r\nsang it to me, and accompanied herself. I was obliged to acknowledge\r\nthat she sang it as well as I could wish, and just as I would have had\r\nit done. It is the best song which she has, and will gain her applause\r\nwherever she sings it.\r\n\r\nThis assertion was justified at a concert given by Cannabich, at which\r\nRose Cannabich, Mdlle. Weber, and Mdlle. Pierron Serrarius, after three\r\nrehearsals, played the concerto for three claviers very well:--\r\n\r\nMdlle. Weber sang two of my songs, \"Aer tranquillo,\" from the \"Re\r\nPastore,\" (208 [3] K.), and the new one, \"Non sö d'onde viene.\" The dear\r\ncreature did herself and me infinite honour. Every one said that she\r\nsurpassed herself in this song; she sang it just as it should be sung.\r\nCannabich called out aloud when it was finished, \"Bravo, bravissimo,\r\nmaestro! veramente, scritta da maestro! This was the first time\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(420)\r\n\r\nI had heard it with the instruments. I wish you could have heard it as\r\nit was sung then, with such accuracy of taste, such _piano_ and _forte_.\r\nWho knows? you may hear it yet. I hope so. The orchestra have not left\r\noff yet praising and talking of the song.\r\n\r\nAnd he himself cannot leave off talking of it:--\r\n\r\nI do certainly wish you could hear my new song sung by her; I say by\r\nher, for it is just made for her. You, who know what is meant by singing\r\nwith _portamento_, would find rare satisfaction in her singing of it.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to beg his father not to allow the song (which he sends him)\r\nto be sung by any one else, since it was written only for Mdlle. Weber,\r\nand fits her like a garment.\r\n\r\nIn truth this song is very beautiful, the simple and natural expression\r\nof what he felt and wished to imply to the singer, original in form and\r\ntreatment. Strikingly original are the short violin passages between\r\nthe phrases of the recitative. The chief movement is adagio, _cantabile_\r\nthroughout, in its calm steady progress beautifully expressive of\r\nalternate doubt and resolution. A very effective contrast is formed\r\nby the animated allegro agitato, which leads back to the adagio in an\r\nunexpected but charming manner; the adagio is not simply repeated, but\r\nthe important points are accentuated, partly by the harmonic treatment,\r\npartly by stronger emphasis, and the grouping and connection are varied.\r\nThe loving care of the composer is displayed again in his management\r\nof the orchestra. The stringed instruments are accurate in detail,\r\nand written with a view to effect; for instance, when the voice in its\r\nhighest, sharpest tones, is accompanied by the violins in a far lower\r\nposition, the effect is excellent. The second violin part is well\r\nthought out, and the accompaniment rich without being overpowering. As\r\nwind instruments, the flutes, clarinets, horns and bassoons, are' so\r\ncombined as to give intensity and brilliancy to the colouring of the\r\nwhole; they are employed with a full mastery of effect, either alone or\r\nin varied combination.\r\n\r\nThe following is the original situation in Metastasio's \"Olimpiade.\"\r\nClisthenes, King of Sicyon, has doomed to death an unknown youth (as\r\nafterwards appears, his son),\r\n\r\n{SONG FOR AL. WEBER, 1778.}\r\n\r\n(421)\r\n\r\nbecause he has attempted to assassinate him. But in the act of\r\ndelivering him to death, he feels himself wonderfully moved by the\r\naspect of the youth, and turns to his confidant with the words:--\r\n\r\nAlcandro, lo confesso, stupisco di me stesso. Il volto, il ciglio, la\r\nvoce di costui nel cor mi desta un palpito improwiso, che lo risente in\r\nogni fibra il sangue. Fra tutti i miei pensieri la cagion ne ricerco e\r\nnon la trovo. Che sarà, giusti Dei, questo ch' io provo?\r\n\r\n     Non si d' onde viene\r\n     Quel tenero affetto\r\n     Quel moto, che ignoto\r\n     Mi nasce nel petto\r\n     Quel gel, che le vene\r\n     Scorrendo mi và.\r\n     Nel seno a destarmi\r\n     Si fieri contrast!\r\n     Non parmi che basti\r\n     La sola pietà.\r\n\r\nMozart describes graphically how the voice and singing of Mdlle. Weber\r\nfloated before him, and inspired his composition, but he does not tell\r\nus how Metastasio's words, released from their dramatic connection,\r\nbecame the soliloquy of a young heart, feeling with amazement the first\r\nstirrings ot love, and scarcely venturing to realise the depth and\r\nintensity of its passion; for pity is assuredly not enough to excite\r\nsuch expressions of emotion. This was the condition of his own heart,\r\nand what he felt himself, that he also placed in the heart of his\r\nbeloved, and, being an artist, on her lips--certainly without analysing\r\nhis feelings or hers. The song expresses purely and beautifully the\r\nemotions of a maiden who stands in doubt and perplexity at the innocent\r\nimpulses of her heart, incomprehensible even to herself. But her budding\r\ninclination has not yet become a dominant passion, and she feels that\r\nshe stands at the turning-point of her whole existence. There reposes,\r\ntherefore, on the whole song the calmness and purity of innocence,\r\ntogether with intense warmth and deep agitation, and Mozart has lent to\r\nthese emotions the inexpressible charm of melody.\r\n\r\nThe charm is not broken by the occurrence of sharper discords than are\r\nusual with Mozart; but they are both\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(422)\r\n\r\nappropriately placed, and in full harmony with the tone of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe song gives a favourable indication of the powers of the singer.\r\nThe style is simple and sustained throughout, varied by original and\r\nexpressive embellishments, and at the close by a couple of quick runs\r\ngoing up to--[See Page Image]\r\n\r\nIt excites no small astonishment to find such capabilities of voice,\r\nexecution, and delivery in a girl of fifteen. Mozart composed the same\r\nsong again for the bass singer Fischer, in March, 1787 (512 K.). The\r\nconstruction of the song is, as the words require, the same, but the\r\ntreatment is as different as possible. This time the true sense of the\r\ndramatic situation is grasped; a man, a ruler, who has a long life's\r\nexperience behind him, feels his strong mind moved to a tenderness which\r\nhe cannot understand, and which therefore troubles him; he seeks to\r\nresist it, but falls ever again under its irresistible sway. The sense\r\nof surprise and passionate resistance is powerfully rendered, and many\r\npassages--\"Quel gel che scorrendo le vene mi và,\" for instance--are of\r\nwonderful power and beauty. In fact, the song presupposes the union of\r\nstrength and softness, flexibility of voice and cultivated delivery,\r\nwhich existed to perfection in Fischer; it might be said as truly of him\r\nas of Mdlle. Weber, that the song fitted him like a garment.\r\n\r\nMozart's change of determination with regard to the Parisian journey is\r\neasily explained by the light of his love for Mdlle. Weber, although\r\nhe was far from acknowledging this, even to himself. No doubt he was\r\nsincere in writing to his father (February 4, 1778): \"It is out of\r\nthe question for me to travel with a man who leads a life of which the\r\nyoungest among us would be ashamed, and the thought of assisting a poor\r\nfamily, without doing harm to myself, pleases me to the very depths of\r\nmy soul.\" He longed ardently to liberate the Weber family from their\r\ntrying position; but love for his Aloysia was the most powerful,\r\nalthough the secret motive. The direction of his thoughts\r\n\r\n{MOZART AND THE WEBERS.}\r\n\r\n(423)\r\n\r\nmay be gathered from his remarks on the wealthy marriage made by his\r\nfriend Herr von Schiedenhofen (February 7, 1778):--\r\n\r\nIt is a mercenary marriage, and nothing further. I would not marry in\r\nthat way; I should like to make my wife happy, and not expect to make my\r\nfortune through her. So I will let it alone for the present, and enjoy\r\nmy freedom, until I can afford to support a wife and family. It was\r\nnecessary for Herr von Schiedenhofen to choose a rich wife for the sake\r\nof his title. The nobility can never marry from inclination or love, but\r\nonly from interest and various considerations; it would not become such\r\nhigh personages to love their wives when once they have brought into the\r\nworld a fat little son and heir. But we poor common folk, not only _may_\r\nwe take a wife whom we love, and who loves us, but we ought, can, and\r\nwill take such an one; for we are not nobly born, aristocratic, or rich,\r\nbut lowly, mean, and poor, and so not needing a rich wife; our wealth\r\ndies with us, for it is in our brains--and no one can take it from us,\r\nunless he cut off our head--and then we should not want anything more.\r\n\r\nThe father must have shaken his head at this diatribe. Wolfgang's wish\r\nat least to live in the neighbourhood of Aloysia, until he could call\r\nher his own, was joined to his irresistible impulse to compose operas.\r\nIn order to attain both these ends he had conceived a project which\r\nwould, he supposed, be of equal advantage to her family and his own.\r\nThe Webers were quite ready to fall in with what was clearly to their\r\nadvantage, and it only remained to obtain the consent of Wolfgang's\r\nfather to his remaining in Mannheim and completing the compositions he\r\nhad undertaken:--\r\n\r\nAt the same time Herr Weber will be exerting himself to get concert\r\nengagements for himself and me; we shall travel together, too.\r\nTravelling with him will be just the same as travelling with you. In\r\nfact, the reason I like him so much is that, excepting in appearance, he\r\nresembles you entirely; his temper and turn of mind are identical with\r\nyours. If my mother were not, as you know, averse to much writing, she\r\nwould say the same thing. I must acknowledge that I enjoyed travelling\r\nwith the Webers; we were happy together, and merry; and I had the\r\nsatisfaction of conversing with a man like yourself. I had no need to\r\ntrouble myself about anything; if anything was torn I found it mended;\r\nin fact, I was treated like a prince. This oppressed family has become\r\nso dear to me that it is my greatest wish to make them happy--which\r\nis perhaps in my power. My advice is that they should go to Italy. You\r\nwould be doing me a great favour if you would write as soon as possible\r\nto our\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(424)\r\n\r\ngood friend Lugiati (p. 108), and inquire from him what is the highest\r\nsum paid to a prima donna in Verona--the higher the better, for it is\r\neasy to lower one's terms--and perhaps she could get a better engagement\r\nafterwards in Venice. I will stake my life on her singing, and I know\r\nthat she does me honour. She has profited much by my instruction, even\r\nin this short time, and I have not much doubt as to her acting powers.\r\n\r\nIf all this takes place, we--that is, M. Weber, his two daughters and\r\nI--shall have the honour of paying a passing visit in a fortnight or so,\r\nto my dear father and my dear sister, and my sister will find a friend\r\nand companion; she enjoys the same reputation here on account of her\r\ngood bringing up as my sister does in Salzburg; her father is respected\r\nas mine is; and the whole family is like the Mozart family. This arouses\r\nenvy in the same way, of course; but when it comes to the point the most\r\nenvious are obliged to speak the truth; honesty is the best policy. I\r\ncannot tell you how pleased I should be to bring them to Salsburg, only\r\nthat you might hear her.\r\n\r\nShe sings my songs written for De Amicis--the bravura songs, as well as\r\n\"Parto m' affretto\" and \"Dalla sponda tenebrosa\"--quite superbly. I\r\nbeg that you will do your best to help us to go to Italy; you know my\r\ngreatest ambition--to write operas. I would gladly write an opera for\r\nthirty sequins at Verona, that she might gain reputation by it; for if\r\nI had not written it I fear she would be sacrificed. In the meantime I\r\nshall make so much money by the expeditions I shall make with them that\r\nI shall not be in any way injured. I think we shall go to Switzerland,\r\nperhaps also to Holland; write to me soon about it. If it all comes to\r\npass, the other daughter, who is the elder, will be very useful, for she\r\ncooks well, and we can keep house for ourselves. I only beg you not to\r\ndelay answering me. Do not forget my wish to write operas! I am jealous\r\nof every one who writes one; I could weep for vexation when I hear or\r\nsee an aria. But Italian, not German; seria, not buffa!\r\n\r\nNow I have laid open my whole heart to you, and my mother is quite of my\r\nway of thinking. I kiss your hand a thousand times, and am, till death,\r\nyour obedient son.\r\n\r\nIn a later letter he repeats his pressing request (February 14, 1778):--\r\n\r\nI earnestly entreat you to do what you can for Weber; I have his success\r\nvery much at heart; a man and his wife, five children, and an income of\r\n450 florins! Remember my request as to Italy, and also about myself; you\r\nknow my ambition and my passion. I hope it will all go right; I put\r\nmy trust in God, and He will not forsake us. Now farewell, and do not\r\nforget my earnest petition and recommendation.\r\n\r\nWolfgang's mother was not quite so much of his opinion as he imagined;\r\nthis is apparent from her postscript, which shows also that she was\r\nentirely without influence over her son:--\r\n\r\n{PATERNAL WARNINGS.}\r\n\r\n(425)\r\n\r\nMy dear Husband,--You will perceive from this letter that when Wolfgang\r\nmakes a new friendship he is ready to sacrifice his life and all he\r\nholds dear for the object of it. It is true that she sings divinely, but\r\none should never so entirely set aside one's own interests. I have never\r\napproved of the companionship with Wendling and Ramm, but I dared not\r\nmake any objection, and I am never listened to. But as soon as he knew\r\nthe Webers, he altered his mind altogether. In fact, he prefers being\r\nwith other people to being with me; I object to this thing and that\r\nwhich does not please me, and that annoys him. So you must decide for\r\nyourself what is to be done. I write this in the greatest secrecy while\r\nhe is dining.\r\n\r\nAnd what said the father? This letter was a greater blow than any which\r\nhad yet befallen him, and Wolfgang's romantic project almost bereft\r\nhim of reason. He did not indeed doubt that \"much persuasion had been\r\nbrought to bear on Wolfgang, to induce him to prefer a vagabond life to\r\nthe fame which could be acquired in a city so celebrated, and so ready\r\nto welcome true talent, as Mannheim\"; but he was horrified to find that\r\nthe influence of strangers could so deprive him of consideration for\r\nhimself and others. \"Your kind heart leads you to see no fault in any\r\nman who praises you loudly and exalts you to the skies, and to bestow\r\nall your love and confidence on him; when you were a child, on the\r\ncontrary, your modesty was so excessive that you wept when you were\r\nopenly praised.\" Sharp remedies seemed in this case necessary, and these\r\nL. Mozart applies with all the authority of an experienced man, and\r\nthe severity of a conscientious father. He lays before his son in an\r\nexhaustive letter how far he has hitherto been from attaining the main\r\nobject of his journey, and how much he is in danger of forgetting his\r\nduty to his family and himself, for the gratification of a senseless\r\npassion. It was not difficult to show that the idea was immature and\r\nimpracticable of producing a young girl, who had never sung in public,\r\nnor appeared on the stage, before an Italian public, which would be\r\ncertain to condemn her even if she sang like Gabrielli herself. L.\r\nMozart goes on to show how, with war threatening, the present was\r\nnot the time for a professional tour, and how a wandering life with a\r\nstranger and his daughters would deprive him of his reputation, ruin his\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(420)\r\n\r\nprospects, and bring disgrace on his family: \"It lies now in your own\r\npower alone to raise yourself to as high a position as a musician has\r\never attained; you owe all to the extraordinary talent bestowed upon\r\nyou by the all-gracious God, and it depends upon your own sense and\r\nbehaviour whether you become an ordinary musician, forgotten by the\r\nworld, or a celebrated kapellmeister whose fame shall be handed down\r\nto posterity in books--whether you herd all together in a room full of\r\nsqualling brats, on a heap of straw, or spend a Christian life, full of\r\nhonour, pleasure and profit, and die respected by all the world, leaving\r\nyour family well provided for.\"\r\n\r\nL. Mozart felt that immediate action was necessary; all his former\r\nobjection to the journey to Paris vanished before the necessity of\r\nextricating his son from his present dangerous entanglement. \"Away with\r\nyou to Paris, and that soon!\" he cried. \"Put yourself at the side of\r\ngreat men--_aut Cosar aut nihil!_ The mere thought of seeing Paris\r\nshould have preserved you from all passing distractions. The name and\r\nfame of a man of great talent goes through all the world from Paris.\"\r\nThe company of Wendling and Ramm was not as important to him as his was\r\nto them. But his mother must go with him in order to arrange everything\r\nproperly; they were not to limit their stay to a few months, but were\r\nto remain as long as was necessary to gain renown and money; the more so\r\nsince Paris was the safest place to live in during war. Hard as it was\r\nupon him, the father undertook to provide money and letters of credit\r\nfor the journey.\r\n\r\nIn making this appeal to the conscience, the ambition, and the better\r\njudgment of his son, L. Mozart was wise enough not to allude directly to\r\nhis attachment to Aloysia Weber, although he must have been well aware\r\nof its existence. Wolfgang had not openly expressed it, and his father\r\nwas careful not to oppose a sentiment which was invincible because\r\ninaccessible to reason. But as a proof that he was not indifferent to\r\nthe misfortunes of those with whom Wolfgang had so much sympathy, he did\r\nnot withhold the advice for which he had been asked. The man\r\n\r\n{WOLFGANG'S FILIAL SUBMISSION.}\r\n\r\n(427)\r\n\r\nwho could best help them was Raaff; Wolfgang should endeavour to\r\ninterest him in Mdlle. Weber, and his influence would be all powerful\r\nwith the impresaii. He further advised that she should make her _début_\r\non the Mannheim stage, were it only for the sake of practice.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this letter was what he anticipated. Wolfgang was brought\r\nto a knowledge of the fact that he had nearer duties to fulfil, to which\r\nhis dreams and aspirations after an uncertain future must give way. He\r\nyielded with a heavy heart but with childlike submission to his father's\r\nwill, and answered (February 19, 1778)\r\n\r\nI always anticipated that you would be against the journey with the\r\nWebers, for I never seriously entertained the idea myself; that is,\r\nunder our present circumstances; but I had given my word that I would\r\nwrite to you about it. Herr Weber does not know how we stand; I have\r\ntold no one; and so because I wanted to be free from care for any one,\r\nand to be happy together, I forgot the present impossibility of the\r\naffair, and also to inform you of my true opinion of it. What you say\r\nconcerning Mdlle. Weber is all true; and, as I wrote before, I know as\r\nwell as you do that she is too young, and wants the power of acting, and\r\nshould therefore recite in the theatre as often as possible; but one has\r\nto proceed cautiously with some people. The good Webers are as tired\r\nof being here as some one else you know was elsewhere; and they are\r\ninclined to think everything possible. I had promised them to write to\r\nmy father; but even before my letter had reached Salzburg I had been\r\nadvising them to be patient, that she was a little too young, &c. They\r\ntake everything well from me, for they have a high opinion of me. The\r\nfather has spoken by my advice to Madame Toscani (an actress) about\r\ngiving his daughter instruction in acting. All that you say of Mdlle.\r\nWeber is true, except one thing: that she sings like a Gabrielli; I\r\nshould be very sorry if she did. Every one who has heard Gabrielli says\r\nshe was nothing but a passage and roulade maker; in a word, that she\r\nsang with art, but no understanding (p. 135). But Mdlle. Weber sings\r\nfrom her heart, and _cantabile_ by preference. I am now making her sing\r\npassages in the great arie, because it is necessary if she goes to Italy\r\nthat she should sing bravura songs; she will not forget her _cantabile,_\r\nbecause it comes natural to her.[107] Now you know all, and I recommend\r\nher to you with my whole heart.\r\n\r\n{MANNHEIM.}\r\n\r\n(428)\r\n\r\nBut it was a hard struggle that he had to make with himself; it affected\r\nhis health, and he was for several days confined to his room. His\r\nfather's warnings had struck chords in his innermost being, which\r\nvibrated painfully; the thought of having forfeited his father's full\r\nconfidence rendered him inconsolable. \"Believe whatever you please\r\nof me, only not that I am wicked. There are people who believe it is\r\nimpossible to love a poor girl without having evil intentions. I am no\r\nBrunetti, and no Misliweczeck--I am a Mozart, a young but an honourable\r\nMozart.\" Gradually, however, his loving trust in his father regained\r\nits old supremacy. \"'God first, and then papa'; that was my motto as a\r\nchild, and I am true to it still.\" He and his mother began to prepare in\r\nearnest for their departure, and the father was ready with instructions\r\nand good advice, nor did he withhold the paternal blessing from his\r\nwell-loved son:--\r\n\r\nHow deeply I feel the wider separation that is about to take place\r\nbetween us you can partly imagine, but I cannot expect you to feel the\r\nintensity with which it oppresses me. If you will only reflect seriously\r\non all that I did for you two children in your early years, you will\r\nnot certainly accuse me of timidity, but you will do me the justice\r\nto acknowledge that I am, and always have been, a man with courage to\r\nventure anything. At the same time I used all possible prudence and\r\nforesight; against accidents no one can provide, for God alone sees into\r\nthe future. I have not, my dear Wolfgang, the least mistrust in you; on\r\nthe contrary, I have perfect confidence and hope in your filial love.\r\nEverything now depends on the sound understanding which you certainly\r\npossess if you will only listen to it, and upon fortunate circumstances;\r\nthese last are not to be controlled, but I hope and pray that you will\r\nalways take counsel of your understanding. You are now about to enter a\r\nnew world, and you must not believe that I am prejudiced in considering\r\nParis so dangerous a place; _au contraire_, my own experience gives\r\nme no cause to think it at all dangerous. But the circumstances of my\r\nformer and your present stay there are as widely asunder as heaven and\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n{DEPARTURE FROM MANNHEIM, 1778.}\r\n\r\n(429)\r\n\r\nAfter explaining this in more detail, and giving Wolfgang minute\r\ndirections as to the position he should take in Paris. L. Mozart\r\nconcludes with the words:--\r\n\r\nI know that you look upon me not only as your father, but as your truest\r\nand firmest friend; and that you are well aware that our happiness and\r\nmisery--nay more, my long life or speedy death are, under God, so to\r\nspeak, in your hands. If I know you aright, I have nothing to look\r\nforward to but that pleasure which will be my only consolation in\r\nyour absence, and I must resign myself to neither seeing, hearing, nor\r\nembracing you. Live like a good Catholic Christian; love God and fear\r\nHim; pray to Him sincerely and devoutly, and let your conduct be\r\nsuch that should I never see you again, my death-bed may be free from\r\nanxiety. From my heart I bless you, and remain till death your loving\r\nfather and firmest friend.\r\n\r\nIt was only when Mozart's departure from Mannheim drew very near that\r\nthe loss on both sides was fully realised. The farewell concerts which\r\nhe arranged as displays for himself, his compositions, and his pupils,\r\nimpressed his extraordinary talents on the public mind. Regrets at his\r\ndeparture were heard on all sides, not only from musicians, but from all\r\nmen of cultivation who had the fame of Mannheim at heart, among them the\r\nauthor of the \"Deutsche Hausvater\" (March 24, 1778):--\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Mannheim I made copies for Herr von Gemmingen of the\r\nquartet (80 K.) which I wrote that evening in the inn at Lodi; also of\r\nthe quintet (174 K.), and of the Fischer variations (179 K.). He wrote\r\nme an extremely polite note, expressing his pleasure at the remembrance,\r\nand sent me a letter to his very good friend, Herr von Sickingen,\r\nadding, \"I am well assured that you will do more to recommend this\r\nletter, than it can possibly do to recommend you.\" And he sent me three\r\nlouis-d'or to cover the cost of copying the music. He assured me of\r\nhis friendship, and begged for mine in return. I must say that all\r\nthe cavaliers who knew me, the court councillors, chamberlains, court\r\nmusicians, and other good people, were vexed and disappointed at my\r\nleaving. There is no mistake about that.\r\n\r\nHe was in some degree consoled by the prospect of finding opportunities\r\nfor composition in Paris (February 28, 1778)\r\n\r\nWhat I chiefly look forward to in Paris is the Concert Spirituel, for\r\nwhich I shall probably have to write something. The orchestra is so good\r\nand strong, and my most favourite compositions, choruses, can be\r\n\r\nMANNHEIM.\r\n\r\n(430)\r\n\r\nwell performed there; I am very glad that the Parisians are so fond\r\nof them. The only fault that was found with Piccinni's new opera\r\n\"Roland\"[108] was that the choruses were weak and poor, and the music\r\naltogether a little monotonous; otherwise it was very well received. The\r\nParisians were accustomed to Gluck's choruses. Rely upon me, I shall do\r\nall that is in my power to bring honour to the name of Mozart; I am not\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\nThe parting from Mdlle. Weber had still to be gone through; he describes\r\nit candidly to his father (March 24, 1778)\r\n\r\nMdlle. Weber very kindly netted me a purse as a remembrance and small\r\nacknowledgment of my services. Her father copied all that I wanted for\r\nme, and gave me some music-paper and Molière's comedies (which he knew\r\nI had not read), with the inscription, \"Ricevi, amico, le opere del\r\nMolière in segno di gratitudine e qualche volta ricordati di me.\" When\r\nhe was alone with mamma, he said, \"We are losing our best friend, our\r\nbenefactor. Yes, there is no doubt that your son has done much for\r\nmy daughter, and has interested himself in her so that she cannot be\r\ngrateful enough to him.\" The day before I left they wanted me to sup\r\nwith them, but I could not be away from home, so refused. But I was\r\nobliged to spend a couple of hours before supper with them, and they\r\nnever left off thanking me, and wishing they were in a position to\r\ntestify their gratitude. When at last I went away they all wept. It is\r\nvery foolish, but the tears come in my eyes whenever I think of it.\r\nHe went down the steps with me, and stood at the house-door till I had\r\nturned the corner, when he called for the last time, \"Adieu!\"\r\n\r\nThis time the father painted no leave-taking on the quoits, but thanked\r\nGod in his heart that his son had escaped a great danger. Wolfgang did\r\nnot openly declare that his love for Mdlle. Weber was heartfelt and\r\nsincere, and that he believed it to be returned, that he went forth with\r\nthe full determination of winning a position, and being able to call\r\nher his own; but he was little careful to conceal these hopes from his\r\nfather[109] as to hide from him the correspondence which he carried on\r\nwith the Webers. The father, with\r\n\r\n{LOVE OF FATHER AND SON.}\r\n\r\n(431)\r\n\r\nfull confidence in the honourable character of his son, was content to\r\nleave this connection to the future so soon as he saw the first step\r\nassured in Wolfgang's professional career.\r\n\r\nOur glance must needs linger with approbation on the picture of a youth\r\nglowing with ardent passion, yet with self-mastery enough to listen\r\nto the first warning of his good and wise father, and so sure of the\r\nconstancy of his feelings as to be willing to yield his warmest wishes\r\nto the fulfilment of his moral duties. In the love and confidence\r\nexisting between father and son we rejoice to acknowledge the best and\r\ntruest ornament of a German artist-life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Schubart, Selbstbiographie 14,1., p. 200.

M. von Weber, IM p. 6), Fridolin von\r\nWeber (b. 1733), alter studying law in Freiburg and becoming Doctor of\r\nTheology, succeeded his father as agent to the Schönau estate in 1754.\r\nKarl Theodor, finding him a first-rate singer and violinist, took him to\r\nMannheim. His younger brother, Franz Anton, was the father of C. M. von\r\nWeber. In the album of Franz Anton's son Edmund, Mozart wrote: \"Vienna,\r\nJanuary 8, 1787, five o'clock in the morning, before setting out.--Be\r\nindustrious; flee from idleness, and never forget your loving cousin,\r\nWolfgang Amade Mozart.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: This is confirmed by Schubart (Aesthetik, p. 192). Cf. Musjk.\r\nAlman. (Alethinop, 1782).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Schubart says of Vogler (Aesthetik, p. 135): \"His lessons in\r\nsinging were much sought after. The well-known singer Lange, of\r\nVienna, was his pupil. She has heighth and depth, and accents her notes\r\naccurately. She sings _piena voce_ and _mezza voce_ equally well. Her\r\n_portamento_, the accuracy of her reading, the delicacy of her delivery,\r\nher _megzotinto_, her wonderful cadenzas, and her dignified bearing, are\r\nin great measure due to her great master.\" Some of all this should\r\nbe ascribed to Mozart. Vogler's lessons were given at a later time in\r\nMunich. Brandes, on the contrary (Selbstbiogr., II., p. 260), says that\r\nKirnberger and others warned him against Vogler as a cacher for his\r\ndaughter Minna.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Piccinni's \"Roland,\" the first opera he wrote in Paris, was\r\nperformed early in 1778.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: \"I have many very good friends in Mannheim (influential and\r\nwealthy ones),\" he writes (March 24, 1778), \"who all wish me to remain.\r\nWell, wherever I am well paid, there I stay. Who knows?--it may come to\r\npass; I wish for it, and, as usual, I am full of hope.\"]",
