AT BELLEVUE\r\n\r\n\r\n“You have the keenest eyes in the troop. Can you see anything ahead?”\r\n asked Colonel Winchester.\r\n\r\n“Nothing living, sir,” replied Dick Mason, as he swept his powerful\r\nglasses in a half-curve. “There are hills on the right and in the\r\ncenter, covered with thick, green forest, and on the left, where the\r\nland lies low, the forest is thick and green too, although I think I\r\ncatch a flash of water in it.”\r\n\r\n“That should be the little river of which our map tells. And you,\r\nWarner, what do your eyes tell you?”\r\n\r\n“The same tale they tell to Dick, sir. It looks to me like a\r\nwilderness.”\r\n\r\n“And so it is. It's a low-lying region of vast forests and thickets,\r\nof slow deep rivers and creeks, and of lagoons and bayous. If Northern\r\ntroops want to be ambushed they couldn't come to a finer place for it.\r\nForrest and five thousand of his wild riders might hide within rifle\r\nshot of us in this endless mass of vegetation. And so, my lads, it\r\nbehooves us to be cautious with a very great caution. You will recall\r\nhow we got cut up by Forrest in the Shiloh time.”\r\n\r\n“I do, sir,” said Dick and he shuddered as he recalled those terrible\r\nmoments. “This is Mississippi, isn't it?”\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester took a small map from his pocket, and, unfolding it,\r\nexamined it with minute care.\r\n\r\n“If this is right, and I'm sure it is,” he replied, “we're far down in\r\nMississippi in the sunken regions that border the sluggish tributaries\r\nof the Father of Waters. The vegetation is magnificent, but for a home\r\ngive me higher ground, Dick.”\r\n\r\n“Me too, sir,” said Warner. “The finest state in this Union is Vermont.\r\nI like to live on firm soil, even if it isn't so fertile, and I like to\r\nsee the clear, pure water running everywhere, brooks and rivers.”\r\n\r\n“I'll admit that Vermont is a good state for two months in the year,”\r\n said Dick.\r\n\r\n“Why not the other ten?”\r\n\r\n“Because then it's frozen up, solid and hard, so I've heard.”\r\n\r\nThe other boys laughed and kept up their chaff, but Colonel Winchester\r\nrode soberly ahead. Behind him trailed the Winchester regiment, now\r\nreorganized and mounted. Fresh troops had come from Kentucky, and\r\nfragments of old regiments practically destroyed at Perryville and Stone\r\nRiver had been joined to it.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid body of men, but of those who had gone to Shiloh only\r\nabout two hundred remained. The great conflicts of the West, and the\r\nminor battles had accounted for the others. But it was perhaps one of\r\nthe reliefs of the Civil War that it gave the lads who fought it little\r\ntime to think of those who fell. Four years crowded with battles, great\r\nand small, sieges and marches absorbed their whole attention.\r\n\r\nNow two men, the dreaded Forrest and fierce little Joe Wheeler, occupied\r\nthe minds of Winchester and his officers. It was impossible to keep\r\ntrack of these wild horsemen here in their own section. They had a habit\r\nof appearing two or three hundred miles from the place at which they\r\nwere expected.\r\n\r\nBut the young lieutenants while they watched too for their redoubtable\r\nfoes had an eye also for the country. It was a new kind of region for\r\nall of them. The feet of their horses sank deep in the soft black soil,\r\nand there was often a sound of many splashings as the regiment rode\r\nacross a wide, muddy brook.\r\n\r\nDick noted with interest the magnolias and the live oaks, and the great\r\nstalks of the sunflower. Here in this Southern state, which bathed\r\nits feet in the warm waters of the Gulf, spring was already far along,\r\nalthough snows still lingered in the North.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation was extravagant in its luxuriance and splendor. The\r\nenormous forest was broken by openings like prairies, and in every one\r\nof them the grass grew thick and tall, interspersed with sunflowers and\r\nblossoming wild plants. Through the woods ran vast networks of vines,\r\nand birds of brilliant plumage chattered in the trees. Twice, deer\r\nsprang up before them and raced away in the forest. It was the\r\nwilderness almost as De Soto had traversed it nearly four centuries\r\nbefore, and it had a majesty which in its wildness was not without its\r\nsinister note.\r\n\r\nThey approached a creek, deeper and wider than usual, flowing in slow,\r\nyellow coils, and, as they descended into the marsh that enclosed its\r\nwaters, there was a sharp crackling sound, followed quickly by another\r\nand then by many others. The reports did not cease, and, although\r\nblood was shed freely, no man fell from his horse, nor was any wounded\r\nmortally. But the assault was vicious and it was pushed home with the\r\nutmost courage and tenacity, although many of the assailants fell never\r\nto rise again. Cries of pain and anger, and imprecations arose from the\r\nstricken regiment.\r\n\r\n“Slap! Slap!”\r\n\r\n“Bang! Bang!”\r\n\r\n“Ouch! He's got his bayonet in my cheek!”\r\n\r\n“Heavens, that struck me like a minie ball! And it came, whistling and\r\nshrieking, too, just like one!”\r\n\r\n“Phew, how they sting! and my neck is bleeding in three places!”\r\n\r\n“By thunder, Bill, I hit that fellow, fair and square! He'll never\r\ntrouble an honest Yankee soldier again!”\r\n\r\nThe fierce buzzing increased all around them and Colonel Winchester\r\nshouted to his trumpeter:\r\n\r\n“Blow the charge at once!”\r\n\r\nThe man, full willing, put the trumpet to his lips and blew loud and\r\nlong. The whole regiment went across the creek at a gallop--the water\r\nflying in yellow showers--and did not stop until, emerging from the\r\nmarsh, they reached the crest of a low hill a mile beyond. Here, stung,\r\nbleeding and completely defeated by the enemy they stopped for repairs.\r\nAn occasional angry buzz showed that they were not yet safe from the\r\nskirmishers, but their attack seemed a light matter after the full\r\nassault of the determined foe.\r\n\r\n“I suppose we're all wounded,” said Dick as he wiped a bleeding cheek.\r\n“At least as far as I can see they're hurt. The last fellow who got his\r\nbayonet in my face turned his weapon around and around and sang merrily\r\nat every revolution.”\r\n\r\n“We were afraid of being ambushed by Forrest,” said Warner, speaking\r\nfrom a swollen countenance. “Instead we struck something worse; we rode\r\nstraight into an ambush of ten billion high-powered mosquitoes, every\r\none tipped with fire. Have we got enemies like these to fight all the\r\nway down here?”\r\n\r\n“They sting the rebels, too,” said Pennington.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but they like newcomers best, the unacclimated. When we rode down\r\ninto that swamp I could hear them shouting, to one another: 'That fat\r\nfellow is mine, I saw him first! I've marked the rosy-cheeked boy for\r\nmine. Keep away the rest of you fellows!' I feel as if I'd been through\r\na battle. No more marshes for me.”\r\n\r\nSome of the provident produced bottles of oil of pennyroyal. Sergeant\r\nDaniel Whitley, who rode a giant bay horse, was one of the most\r\nforeseeing in this respect, and, after the boys had used his soothing\r\nliniment freely, the fiery torment left by the mosquito's sting passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant seemed to have grown bigger and broader than ever. His\r\nshoulders were about to swell through his faded blue coat, and the hand\r\nresting easily on the rein had the grip and power of a bear's paw. His\r\nrugged face had been tanned by the sun of the far south to the color of\r\nan Indian's. He was formidable to a foe, and yet no gentler heart beat\r\nthan that under his old blue uniform. Secretly he regarded the young\r\nlieutenants, his superiors in military rank and education, as brave\r\nchildren, and often he cared for them where his knowledge and skill were\r\ngreater than theirs or even than that of colonels and generals.\r\n\r\n“God bless you, Sergeant,” said Dick, “you don't look like an angel, but\r\nyou are one--that is, of the double-fisted, fighting type.”\r\n\r\nThe sergeant merely smiled and replaced the bottle carefully in his\r\npocket, knowing that they would have good use for it again.\r\n\r\nThe regiment after salving its wounds resumed its watchful march.\r\n\r\n“Do you know where we're going?” Pennington asked Dick.\r\n\r\n“I think we're likely if we live long enough to land in the end before\r\nVicksburg, the great Southern fortress, but as I gather it we mean\r\nto curve and curl and twist about a lot before then. Grant, they say,\r\nintends to close in on Vicksburg, while Rosecrans farther north is\r\nwatching Bragg at Chattanooga. We're a flying column, gathering up\r\ninformation, and ready for anything.”\r\n\r\n“It's funny,” said Warner thoughtfully, “that we've already got so far\r\nsouth in the western field. We can't be more than two or three hundred\r\nmiles from the Gulf. Besides, we've already taken New Orleans, the\r\nbiggest city of the South, and our fleet is coming up the river to meet\r\nus. Yet in the East we don't seem to make any progress at all. We lose\r\ngreat battles there and Fredericksburg they say was just a slaughter of\r\nour men. How do you make it out, Dick?”\r\n\r\n“I've thought of several reasons for it. Our generals in the West are\r\nbetter than our generals in the East, or their generals in the East are\r\nbetter than their generals in the West. And then there are the rivers.\r\nIn the East they mostly run eastward between the two armies, and they\r\nare no help to us, but a hindrance rather. Here in the West the rivers,\r\nand they are many and great, mostly run southward, the way we want to\r\ngo, and they bring our gunboats on their bosoms. Excuse my poetry, but\r\nit's what I mean.”\r\n\r\n“You must be right. I think that all the reasons you give apply\r\ntogether. But our command of the water has surely been a tremendous\r\nhelp. And then we've got to remember, Dick, that there was never a navy\r\nlike ours. It goes everywhere and it does everything. Why, if Admiral\r\nFarragut should tell one of those gunboats to steam across the\r\nMississippi bottoms it would turn its saucy nose, steer right out of\r\nthe water into the mud, and blow up with all hands aboard before it quit\r\ntrying.”\r\n\r\n“You two fellows talk too much,” said Pennington. “You won't let\r\nPresident Lincoln and Grant and Halleck manage the war, but you want to\r\nrun it yourselves.”\r\n\r\n“I don't want to run anything just now, Frank,” rejoined Dick. “What I'm\r\nthinking about most is rest and something to eat. I'd like to get rid,\r\ntoo, of about ten pounds of Mississippi mud that I'm carrying.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I can catch a glint of white pillars through those trees.\r\nIt means the 'big house' of a plantation, and you'll probably find\r\nsomewhere back of it the long rows of cabins, inhabited by the dark\r\npeople, whom we've come to raise to the level of their masters, if not\r\nabove them. I can see right now the joyous welcome we'll receive from\r\nthe owners of the big house. They'll be standing on the great piazza,\r\nwaving Union flags and shouting to us that they have ready cooling\r\ndrinks and luxurious food for us all.”\r\n\r\n“It's hardly a joke to me. Whatever the cause of the war, it's the\r\nbitterness of death for these people to be overrun. Besides, I remember\r\nthe words of that old fellow in the blacksmith shop before we fought\r\nthe battle of Stone River. He said that even if they were beaten they'd\r\nstill be there holding the land and running things.”\r\n\r\n“That's true,” said Warner. “I've been wondering how this war would end,\r\nand now I'm wondering what will happen after it does end. But here we\r\nare at the gate. What big grounds! These great planters certainly had\r\nspace!”\r\n\r\n“And what silence!” said Dick. “It's uncanny, George. A place like this\r\nmust have had a thousand slaves, and I don't see any of them rushing\r\nforward to welcome their liberators.”\r\n\r\n“Probably contraband, gone long ago to Ben Butler at New Orleans. I\r\ndon't believe there's a soul here.”\r\n\r\n“Remember that lone house in Tennessee where a slip of a girl brought\r\nForrest down on us and had us cut pretty nearly to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn't forget it.”\r\n\r\nNor could Colonel Winchester. The house, large and low, stood in grounds\r\ncovering an area of several acres, enclosed by a paling fence, now\r\nsagging in many places. Great stone posts stood on either side of the\r\ngateway, but the gate was opened, and it, too, sagged.\r\n\r\nThe grounds had evidently been magnificent, both with flowers and forest\r\ntrees. Already many of the flowers were blooming in great luxuriance and\r\nbrilliancy, but the walks and borders were untrimmed. The house was of\r\nwood, painted white with green shutters, and as they drew nearer they\r\nappreciated its great size, although it was only two stories in height.\r\nA hundred persons could have slept there, and twice as many could have\r\nfound shade in the wide piazzas which stretched the full length of the\r\nfour sides.\r\n\r\nBut all the doors and shutters were closed and no smoke rose from any\r\nchimney. They caught a glimpse of the cabins for the slaves, on lower\r\nground some distance behind the great house. The whole regiment reined\r\nup as they approached the carriage entrance, and, although they were\r\neight hundred strong, there was plenty of room without putting a single\r\nhoof upon a flower.\r\n\r\nIt was a great place. That leaped to the eye, but it was not marked upon\r\nColonel Winchester's map, nor had he heard of it.\r\n\r\n“It's a grand house,” he said to his aides, “and it's a pity that it\r\nshould go to ruin after the slaves are freed, as they certainly will\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\n“But it was built upon slave labor,” said Warner.\r\n\r\n“So it was, and so were many of the most famous buildings in the world.\r\nBut here, I'm not going to get into an argument about such questions\r\nwith young men under my command. Besides, I'm fighting to destroy\r\nslavery, not to study its history. Sergeant Whitley, you're an\r\nexperienced trailer: do you see any signs that troops have passed here?”\r\n\r\n“None at all, sir. Down near the gate where the drive is out of repair\r\nI noticed wheel tracks, but they were several days old. The freshest of\r\nthem were light, as if made by buggies. I judge, sir, that it was the\r\nfamily, the last to leave.”\r\n\r\n“And the wagons containing their valuables had gone on ahead?”\r\n\r\n“It would seem so, sir.”\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester sighed.\r\n\r\n“An invader is always feared and hated,” he said.\r\n\r\n“But we do come as enemies,” said Dick, “and this feeling toward us\r\ncan't be helped.”\r\n\r\n“That's true. No matter what we do we'll never make any friends here in\r\none of the Gulf states, the very core of Southern feeling. Dick, take\r\na squad of men and enter the house. Pennington, you and Warner go with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nDick sprang down instantly, chose Sergeant Whitley first and with the\r\nothers entered the great portico. The front door was locked but it\r\nwas easy enough to force it with a gun butt, and they went in, but\r\nnot before Dick had noticed over the door in large letters the name,\r\n“Bellevue.” So this was Bellevue, one of the great cotton plantations of\r\nMississippi. He now vaguely remembered that he had once heard his uncle,\r\nColonel Kenton, speak of having stopped a week here. But he could not\r\nrecall the name of the owner. Strong for the Union as he was Dick was\r\nglad that the family had gone before the Northern cavalry came.\r\n\r\nThe house was on a splendid scale inside also, but all the rugs and\r\ncurtains were gone. As they entered the great parlor Dick saw a large\r\npiece of paper, and he flushed as he read written upon it in tall\r\nletters:\r\n\r\n          TO THE YANKEE RAIDERS:\r\n     YOU NEED NOT LOOK FOR THE SILVER.\r\n      IT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO VICKSBURG.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Look at that!” he said indignantly to Warner. “See how they taunt us!”\r\n\r\nBut Warner laughed.\r\n\r\n“Maybe some of our men at New Orleans have laid us open to such a stab,”\r\n he said. Then he added whimsically:\r\n\r\n“We'll go to Vicksburg with Grant, Dick, and get that silver yet.”\r\n\r\n“The writing's fresh,” said Sergeant Whitley, who also looked at the\r\nnotification. “The paper hasn't begun to twist and curl yet. It's not\r\nbeen posted up there many hours.”\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester entered at that moment and the notice was handed to\r\nhim. He, too, flushed a little when he read it, but the next instant he\r\nlaughed. Dick then called his attention to the apparent fact that it had\r\nbeen put there recently.\r\n\r\n“May I speak a word, Colonel,” said Warner, who had been thinking so\r\nhard that there was a line the full length of his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Yes, George, a dozen if you like. Go ahead. What is it?”\r\n\r\n“The sergeant, who has had much experience as a trailer, told us that\r\nthe tracks made by the buggy wheels were several days old. The slaves\r\nprobably had been sent southward before that time. Now some one who\r\nsaw our advance has come back, and, whoever it was, he was thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the house. He couldn't have been a servant. Servants\r\ndon't leave taunts of that kind. It must have been somebody who felt our\r\ncoming deeply, and if it had been an elderly man he would have waited\r\nfor action, he wouldn't have used saucy words. So, sir, I think it must\r\nhave been a boy. Just like Pennington there, for instance.”\r\n\r\n“Good, George, go on with your reasonings.”\r\n\r\n“As surely, sir, as z plus y equals the total of the two, the one who\r\nput up the placard was a son of the owner. He alone would feel deeply\r\nenough to take so great a risk. The conditions absolutely demand that\r\nthe owner has such a son and that he has done it.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, George. I think you're right, and this youth in giving way\r\nto a natural burst of anger, although he did not mean to do so, has\r\nposted up for us a warning. A lad of his spirit would go in search\r\nof Forrest, and we cannot forget our experience with that general in\r\nTennessee. Now, boys, we'll make ready for the night, which is not far\r\naway.”\r\n\r\nThe house was built for a Southern climate, although Dick had learned\r\nthat it could be cold enough in Central Mississippi in midwinter. But\r\nit was spring now and they opened all the doors and windows, letting the\r\npleasant air rush through the musty house.\r\n\r\n“It may rain,” said Colonel Winchester, “and the officers will sleep\r\ninside. The men will spread their blankets on the piazzas, and the\r\nhorses will be tethered in the grounds. I hate to see the flowers and\r\ngrass trodden down, but nature will restore them.”\r\n\r\nSome of the soldiers gathered wood from heaps nearby and fires were\r\nkindled in the kitchen, and also on the hearths in the slave quarters.\r\nColonel Winchester had been truly called the father of his regiment.\r\nHe was invariably particular about its health and comfort, and, as he\r\nalways led it in person in battle, there was no finer body of men in the\r\nUnion service.\r\n\r\nNow he meant for his men to have coffee, and warm food after this long\r\nand trying ride and soon savory odors arose, although the cooking was\r\nnot begun until after dark, lest the smoke carry a signal to a lurking\r\nenemy. The cavalrymen cut the thick grass which grew everywhere, and fed\r\nit to their horses, eight hundred massive jaws munching in content. The\r\nbeasts stirred but little after their long ride and now and then one\r\nuttered a satisfied groan.\r\n\r\nThe officers drank their coffee and ate their food on the eastern\r\npiazza, which overlooked a sharp dip toward a creek three or four\r\nhundred yards away. The night had rushed down suddenly after the fashion\r\nof the far South, and from the creek they heard faintly the hoarse frogs\r\ncalling. Beyond the grounds a close ring of sentinels watched, because\r\nColonel Winchester had no mind to be surprised again by Forrest or by\r\nFighting Joe Wheeler or anybody else.\r\n\r\nThe night was thick and dark and moist with clouds. Dick, despite the\r\npeace that seemed to hang over everything, was oppressed. The desolate\r\nhouse, even more than the sight of the field after the battle was over,\r\nbrought home to him the meaning of war. It was not alone the death\r\nof men but the uprooting of a country for their children and their\r\nchildren's children as well. Then his mind traveled back to his uncle,\r\nColonel Kenton, and suddenly he smote his knee.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Dick,” asked Colonel Winchester, who sat only two or three\r\nyards away.\r\n\r\n“Now I remember, sir. When I was only seven or eight years old I heard\r\nmy uncle tell of stopping, as I told you, at a great plantation in\r\nMississippi called Bellevue, but I couldn't recall the name of its\r\nowner. I know him now.”\r\n\r\n“What is the name, Dick?”\r\n\r\n“Woodville, John Woodville. He was a member of the Mississippi Senate,\r\nand he was probably the richest man in the State.”\r\n\r\n“I think I have heard the name. He is a Confederate colonel now, with\r\nPemberton's army. No doubt we'll have to fight him later on.”\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, we're using his house.”\r\n\r\n“Fortune of war. But all war is in a sense unfair, because it's usually\r\na question of the greater force. At any rate, Dick, we won't harm\r\nColonel Woodville's home.”\r\n\r\n“Yet in the end, sir, a lot of these great old country places will go,\r\nand what will take their place? You and I, coming from a border state,\r\nknow that the colored race is not made up of Uncle Toms.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Dick, we haven't won yet, and until we do we won't bother\r\nourselves about the aftermath of war. I'm glad we found so large a place\r\nas this. At the last moment I sent part of the men to the cabins, but\r\nat least three or four hundred must lie here on the piazzas. And most of\r\nthem are already asleep. It's lucky they have roofs. Look how the clouds\r\nare gathering!”\r\n\r\nAs much more room had been made upon the piazzas by the assignment of\r\nmen to the cabins, Colonel Winchester and some of his officers also\r\nrested there. Dick, lying between the two blankets which he always\r\ncarried in a roll tied to his saddle, was very comfortable now, with his\r\nhead on his knapsack. The night had turned cooler, and, save when faint\r\nand far lightning quivered, it was heavy and dark with clouds. But the\r\nyoung lieutenants, hardened by two years of war and life in the open,\r\nfelt snug and cosy on the broad, sheltered piazza. It was not often they\r\nfound such good quarters, and Dick, like Colonel Winchester, was truly\r\nthankful that they had reached Bellevue before the coming storm.\r\n\r\nIt was evident now that the night was going to be wild. The lightning\r\ngrew brighter and came nearer, cutting fiercely across the southern sky.\r\nThe ominous rumble of thunder, which reminded Dick so much of the mutter\r\nof distant battle, came from the horizon on which the lightning was\r\nflashing.\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester, Pennington and Warner had gone to sleep, but Dick\r\nwas wakeful. He had again that feeling of pity for the people who had\r\nbeen compelled to flee from such a house, and who might lose it forever.\r\nIt seemed to him that all the men, save himself and the sentinels, were\r\nasleep, sleeping with the soundness and indifference to surroundings\r\nshown by men who took their sleep when they could.\r\n\r\nThe horses stamped and moved uneasily beneath the threat of the\r\nadvancing storm, but the men slept heavily on.\r\n\r\nDick knew that the sentinels were awake and watchful. They had a\r\nwholesome dread of Forrest and Wheeler, those wild riders of the South.\r\nSome of them had been present at that terrible surprise in Tennessee,\r\nand they were not likely to be careless when they were sure that Forrest\r\nmight be near, but he remained uneasy nevertheless, and, although he\r\nclosed his eyes and sought a soft place for his head on the saddle,\r\nsleep did not come.\r\n\r\nHe was sure that his apprehension did not come from any fear of an\r\nattack by Forrest or Wheeler. It was deeper-seated. The inherited sense\r\nthat belonged to his great grandfather, who had lived his life in the\r\nwilderness, was warning him. It was not superstition. It seemed to Dick\r\nmerely the palpable result of an inheritance that had gone into the\r\nblood. His famous great-grandfather, Paul Cotter, and his famous friend,\r\nHenry Ware, had lived so much and so long among dangers that the very\r\nair indicated to them when they were at hand.\r\n\r\nDick looked down the long piazza, so long that the men at either end of\r\nit were hidden by darkness. The tall trees in the grounds were nodding\r\nbefore the wind, and the lightning flashed incessantly in the southwest.\r\nThe thunder was not loud, but it kept up a continuous muttering and\r\nrumbling. The rain was coming in fitful gusts, but he knew that it would\r\nsoon drive hard and for a long time.\r\n\r\nEverybody within Dick's area of vision was sound asleep, except himself.\r\nColonel Winchester lay with his head on his arm and his slumber was so\r\ndeep that he was like one dead. Warner had not stirred a particle in the\r\nlast half-hour. Dick was angry at himself because he could not sleep.\r\nLet the storm burst! It might drive on the wide roof of the piazza\r\nand the steady beating sound would make his sleep all the sounder and\r\nsweeter. He recalled, as millions of American lads have done, the days\r\nwhen he lay in his bed just under the roof and heard hail and sleet\r\ndrive against it, merely to make him feel all the snugger in the bed\r\nwith his covers drawn around him.\r\n\r\nThe fitful gusts of rain ceased, and then it came with a steady pour and\r\nroar, driving directly down, thus leaving the men on the outer edges of\r\nthe piazzas untouched and dry. Still, Dick did not sleep, and at last\r\nhe arose and walked softly into the house. Here the sense of danger\r\ngrew stronger. He was reminded again of his early boyhood, when some one\r\nblindfolded was told to find a given object, and the others called “hot”\r\n when he was near or “cold” when he was away. He was feeling hot now.\r\nThat inherited sense, the magnetic feeling out of the past, was warning\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDick felt sure that some one not of their regiment was in the building.\r\nHe neither saw nor heard the least sign of a presence, but he was\r\nabsolutely certain that he was not alone within Bellevue. Since the\r\nlightning had ceased it was pitchy dark inside. There was a wide hall\r\nrunning through the building, with windows above the exits, but he saw\r\nnothing through them save the driving rain and the dim outline of the\r\nthreshing trees.\r\n\r\nHe turned into one of the side rooms, and then he paused and pushed\r\nhimself against the wall. He was sure now that he heard a soft footstep.\r\nThe darkness was so intense that it could be felt like a mist. He waited\r\nbut he did not hear it again, and then he began to make his way around\r\nthe wall, stepping as lightly as he could.\r\n\r\nHe had gone through most of the rooms at their arrival and he still\r\nretained a clear idea of the interior of the house. He knew that there\r\nwas another door on the far side of the chamber in which he stood, and\r\nhe meant to follow the wall until he reached it. Some one had been in\r\nthe room with him and Dick believed that he was leaving by the far door.\r\n\r\nWhile he heard no further footsteps he felt a sudden light draught on\r\nhis face and he knew that the door had been opened and shut. He might\r\ngo to Colonel Winchester and tell him that a lurking spy or somebody\r\nof that character was in the house, but what good would it do? A spy\r\nat such a time and in such a place could not harm them, and the whole\r\nregiment would be disturbed for nothing. He would follow the chase\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nHe found the door and passed into the next room. Its windows opened upon\r\nthe southern piazza and two or three shutters were thrown back. A faint\r\nlight entered and Dick saw that no one was there but himself. He could\r\ndiscern the dim figures of the soldiers sleeping on the piazza and\r\nbeyond a cluster of the small pines grown on lawns.\r\n\r\nDick felt that he had lost the trail for the time, but he did not intend\r\nto give it up. Doubtless the intruder was some one who knew the house\r\nand who was also aware of his presence inside. He also felt that he\r\nwould not be fired upon, because the stranger himself would not wish to\r\nbring the soldiers down upon him. So, with a hand upon his pistol butt,\r\nhe opened the side door and followed once more into the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe ghostly chase went on for a full half-hour, Dick having nothing to\r\nserve him save an occasional light footfall. There was one period of\r\nmore than half an hour when he lost the fugitive entirely. He wandered\r\nup to the second floor and then back again. There, in a room that had\r\nbeen the library, he caught a glimpse of the man. But the figure was so\r\nshadowy that he could tell nothing about him.\r\n\r\n“Halt!” cried Dick, snatching out his pistol. But when he leveled it\r\nthere was nothing to aim at. The figure had melted away, or rather it\r\nhad flitted through another door. Dick followed, chagrined. The stranger\r\nseemed to be playing with him. Obviously, it was some one thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the house, and that brought to Dick's mind the thought\r\nthat he himself, instead of the other man, was the stranger there.\r\n\r\nHe came at last to a passage which led to the kitchen, a great room,\r\nbecause many people were often guests at Bellevue, and here he stopped\r\nshort, while his heart suddenly beat hard. A distinct odor coming from\r\ndifferent points suddenly assailed his nostrils. He had smelled it too\r\noften in the last two years to be mistaken. It was smoke, and Bellevue\r\nhad been set on fire in several places.\r\n\r\nHe inhaled it once or twice and then he saw again the shadowy figure\r\nflitting down to the passage and to a small door that, unnoticed by the\r\nsoldiers, opened on the kitchen garden in the rear of the house.\r\n\r\nDick never acted more promptly. Instantly he fired his pistol into the\r\nceiling, the report roaring in the confined spaces of the house, and\r\nthen shouting with all his might: “Fire! Fire! Fire!” as he dashed down\r\nthe passage he ran through the little door, which the intruder had left\r\nopen, and pursued him in the darkness and rain into the garden. There\r\nwas a flash ahead of him and a bullet whistled past his ear, but he\r\nmerely increased his speed and raced in the direction of the flash. As\r\nhe ran he heard behind him a tremendous uproar, the voices and tread\r\nof hundreds of soldiers, awakened suddenly, and he knew that they would\r\nrush through Bellevue in search of the fires.\r\n\r\nBut it was Dick's impulse to capture the daring intruder who would\r\ndestroy the house over their heads. Built of wood, it would burn so\r\nfast, once the torches were set, that the rain would have little effect\r\nupon the leaping flames, unless measures were taken at once, which he\r\nknew that the regiment would do, under such a capable man as Colonel\r\nWinchester. Meanwhile he was hot in pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe trail which was not that of footsteps, but of a shadowy figure, ran\r\nbetween tall and close rows of grapevines so high on wooden framework\r\nthat they hid any one who passed. The suspicion that Dick had held at\r\nfirst was confirmed. This was no stranger, no intruder. He knew every\r\ninch of both house and grounds, and, after having set the house on fire,\r\nhe had selected the only line of retreat, but a safe one, through the\r\nthick and lofty vegetation of the garden, which ran down to the edge\r\nof the ravine in the rear, where he could slip quietly under the fence,\r\ndrop through the thick grass into the ravine unseen by the pickets, and\r\nescape at his leisure in the darkness.\r\n\r\nDick was so sure of his theory that he strained every effort to overtake\r\nthe figure which was flitting before him like a ghost. In his eagerness\r\nhe had forgotten to shout any alarm about the pickets, but it would\r\nhave been of no avail, as most of them, under the impulse of alarm, had\r\nrushed forward to help extinguish the fires.\r\n\r\nHe saw the fugitive reach the end of the garden, drop almost flat, and\r\nthen slip under a broken place in the palings. At an ordinary time\r\nhe would have stopped there, but all the instincts of the hunter were\r\naroused. It was still raining, and he was already soaked. Wet branches\r\nand leaves struck him in the face as he passed, but his energy and\r\neagerness were undimmed.\r\n\r\nHe, too, dropped at the hole under the broken palings and slid forward\r\nface foremost. The wet grass was as slippery as ice, and after he passed\r\nthrough the hole Dick kept going. Moreover, his speed increased. He had\r\nnot realized that the garden went to the very edge of the ravine, and he\r\nwas shooting down a steep slope to the depth of thirty feet. He grasped\r\ninstinctively at weeds and grass as he made his downward plunge and\r\nfetched up easily at the bottom.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet and saw the shadowy fugitive running down the\r\nravine. In an instant he followed headlong, tripped once or twice on the\r\nwet grass, but was up every time like lightning, and once more in swift\r\npursuit. The fugitive turned once, raised his pistol and pulled the\r\ntrigger again, evidently forgetful that it was empty. When the hammer\r\nsnapped on the trigger he uttered a low cry of anger and hurled the\r\nuseless weapon into the grass. Then he whirled around and faced Dick,\r\nwho was coming on, eager and panting.\r\n\r\nDick's own pistol was empty and he did not carry his small sword. He\r\nstopped abruptly when the other turned, and, in the dim light and rain,\r\nhe saw that his opponent was a young man or rather youth of about his\r\nown size and age. When he saw the lad cast the pistol aside Dick, moved\r\nby some chivalrous impulse, dropped his own in the grass.\r\n\r\nThen the two stared at each other. They were far beyond the line of the\r\npickets, and as they stood in the deep ravine there was no chance that\r\nany one would either see or hear them. As Dick gazed intently, the face\r\nand figure of his antagonist shaped themselves more distinctly in the\r\ndim light. He beheld before him a tall youth, extremely well built, fair\r\nof face, his brown hair slightly long. He wore rain-soaked civilian's\r\ngarb.\r\n\r\nHe saw that the youth was panting like himself, but it was not wholly\r\nthe result of flight. His face expressed savage anger and indignation.\r\n\r\n“You dirty Yankee!” he said.\r\n\r\nDick started. No one had ever before addressed him with such venom.\r\n\r\n“If by Yankee you mean loyalty to the Union then I'm one,” he said, “and\r\nI'm proud of it. What's more I'm willing to tell who I am. My name is\r\nRichard Mason. I'm from Kentucky, and I'm a lieutenant in the regiment\r\nof Colonel Arthur Winchester, which occupies the building behind us.”\r\n\r\n“From Kentucky and consorting with Yankees! A lot of you are doing it,\r\nand you ought to be on our side! We hate you for it more than we do the\r\nreal Yankees!”\r\n\r\n“It's our right to choose, and we've chosen. And now, since you're\r\ntalking so much about right and wrong, who may you be, Mr. Firebug?”\r\n\r\nEven in the dark Dick saw his opponent's face flush, and his eyes flash\r\nwith deadly hostility.\r\n\r\n“My name is Victor Woodville,” he replied, “and my father is Colonel\r\nJohn Woodville, C.S.A. He is the owner of the house in which your\r\ninfamous Yankee regiment is encamped.”\r\n\r\n“And which you have tried to burn?”\r\n\r\n“I'd rather see it burn than shelter Yankees. You'd burn it anyway later\r\non. Grant's troops have already begun to use the torch.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate you'll go before our colonel. He'll want to ask you a lot\r\nof questions.”\r\n\r\n“I'm not going before your colonel.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, you are.”\r\n\r\n“Who's going to take me?”\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“Then come on and do it.”\r\n\r\nDick advanced warily. Both had regained their breath and strength now.\r\nDick with two years of active service in the army had the size and\r\nmuscles of a man. But so had his opponent. Each measured the other, and\r\nthey were formidable antagonists, well matched.\r\n\r\nDick had learned boxing at the Pendleton Academy, and, as he approached\r\nslowly, looking straight into the eyes of his enemy, he suddenly shot\r\nhis right straight for Woodville's chin. The Mississippian, as light on\r\nhis feet as a leopard, leaped away and countered with his left, a blow\r\nso quick and hard that Dick, although he threw his head to one side,\r\ncaught a part of its force just above his ear. But, guarding himself, he\r\nsprang back, while Woodville faced him, laughing lightly.\r\n\r\nDick shook his head a little and the singing departed. Just above his\r\near he felt a great soreness, but he was cool now. Moreover, he was\r\nlosing his anger.\r\n\r\n“First blow for you,” he said. “I see that you know how to use your\r\nfists.”\r\n\r\n“I hope to prove it.”\r\n\r\nWoodville, stepping lightly on his toes and feinting with his left,\r\ncaught Dick on his cheek bone with his right. Then he sought to spring\r\naway, but Dick, although staggered, swung heavily and struck Woodville\r\non the forehead. The Mississippian went down full length on the slippery\r\ngrass but jumped to his feet in an instant. Blood was flowing from his\r\nforehead, whence it ran down his nose and fell to the earth, drop by\r\ndrop. Dick himself was bleeding from the cut on his cheek bone.\r\n\r\nThe two faced each other, cool, smiling, but resolute enemies.\r\n\r\n“First knockdown for you,” said Woodville, “but I mean that the second\r\nshall be mine.”\r\n\r\n“Go in and try.”\r\n\r\nBut Woodville drew back a little, and as Dick followed, looking for an\r\nopening he was caught again a heavy clip on the side of the head. He\r\nsaw stars and was not able to return the blow, but he sprang back and\r\nprotected himself once more with his full guard, while he regained his\r\nbalance and strength.\r\n\r\n“Am I a firebug?” asked Woodville tauntingly.\r\n\r\nDick considered. This youth interested him. There was no denying that\r\nWoodville had great cause for anger, when he found his father's house\r\noccupied by a regiment of the enemy. He considered it defilement. The\r\nright or wrong of the war had nothing to do with it. It was to him a\r\nmatter of emotion.\r\n\r\n“I'll take back the epithet 'firebug,'” he said, “but I must stick to my\r\npurpose of carrying you to Colonel Winchester.”\r\n\r\n“Always provided you can: Look out for yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe Mississippian, who was wonderfully agile, suddenly danced in--on his\r\ntoes it seemed to Dick--and landed savagely on his opponent's left ear.\r\nThen he was away so quickly and lightly that Dick's return merely cut\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nThe Kentuckian felt the blood dripping from another point. His ear,\r\nmoreover, was very sore and began to swell rapidly. One less enduring\r\nwould have given up, but he had a splendid frame, toughened by incessant\r\nhardship. And, above all, enclosed within that frame was a lion heart.\r\nHe shook his head slightly, because a buzzing was going on there, but in\r\na moment or two it stopped.\r\n\r\n“Are you satisfied?” asked young Woodville.\r\n\r\n“You remember what Paul Jones said: 'I've just begun to fight.'”\r\n\r\n“Was it Paul Jones? Well, I suppose it was. Anyhow, if you feel that way\r\nabout it, so do I. Then come on again, Mr. Richard Mason.”\r\n\r\nDick's blood was up. The half-minute or so of talk had enabled him to\r\nregain his breath. Although he felt that incessant pain and swelling in\r\nhis left ear, his resolution to win was unshaken. Pride was now added to\r\nhis other motives.\r\n\r\nHe took a step forward, feinted, parried skillfully, and then stepped\r\nback. Woodville, always agile as a panther, followed him and swung for\r\nthe chin, but Dick, swerving slightly to one side, landed with great\r\nforce on Woodville's jaw. The young Mississippian fell, but, while Dick\r\nstood looking at him, he sprang to his feet and faced his foe defiantly.\r\nThe blood was running down his cheek and dyeing the whole side of his\r\nface. But Dick saw the spirit in his eye and knew that he was far from\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nWoodville smiled and threw back his long hair from his face.\r\n\r\n“A good one for you. You shook me up,” he admitted, “but I don't see any\r\nsign of your ability to carry me to that Yankee colonel, as you boasted\r\nyou would do.”\r\n\r\n“But I'm going to do it.”\r\n\r\nThe rain increased and washed the blood from both their faces. It was\r\ndark within the ravine, but they had been face to face so long that they\r\ncould read the eyes of each other. Those of Woodville like those of Dick\r\nceased to express great anger. In the mind of each was growing a respect\r\nfor his antagonist. The will to conquer remained, but not the desire to\r\nhate.\r\n\r\n“If you're going to do it, then why don't you?” said Woodville.\r\n\r\nDick moved slowly forward, still watching the eyes of the Mississippian.\r\nHe believed now that Woodville, agile and alert though he might be, had\r\nnot fully recovered his strength. There was terrific steam in that last\r\npunch and the head of the man who had received it might well be buzzing\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nDick then moved in with confidence, but a lightning blow crashed through\r\nhis guard, caught him on the chin and sent him to earth. He rose,\r\nthough still half-stunned, and saw that the confident, taunting look had\r\nreturned to Woodville's face. Fortunate now for Dick that the pure blood\r\nof great woods rangers flowed in his veins, and that he had inherited\r\nfrom them too an iron frame. His chin was cut and he had seen a thousand\r\nstars. But his eyes cleared and steadily he faced his foe.\r\n\r\n“Do I go with you to your colonel?” asked Woodville, ironically.\r\n\r\n“You do,” replied Dick firmly.\r\n\r\nHe looked his enemy steadily in the eye again, and he felt a great sense\r\nof triumph. After such severe punishment he was stronger than ever and\r\nhe knew it.\r\n\r\nTherefore he must win. He struck heavily, straight for the angle of\r\nWoodville's chin. The Mississippian evaded the blow and flashed in with\r\nhis left. But Dick, who was learning to be very wary, dodged it and came\r\nback so swiftly that Woodville was caught and beaten to his knees.\r\n\r\nBut the son of the house of Bellevue was still so agile that he was\r\nable to recover his feet and spring away. Dick saw, however, that he was\r\npanting heavily. The blow had taken a considerable part of his remaining\r\nstrength. He also saw that his antagonist was regarding him with a\r\ncurious eye.\r\n\r\n“You fight well, Yank,” said Woodville, “although I ought not to call\r\nyou Yank, but rather a traitor, as you're a Kentuckian. Still, I've\r\nput my marks on you. You're bleeding a lot and you'd be a sight if it\r\nweren't for this cleansing rain.”\r\n\r\n“I've been putting the map of Kentucky on your own face. You don't look\r\nas much like Mississippi as you did. You'll take notice too that you\r\ndidn't burn the house. If you'll glance up the side of this ravine\r\nyou'll see just a little dying smoke. Eight hundred soldiers put it out\r\nin short order.”\r\n\r\nWoodville's face flushed, and his eyes for the first time since the\r\nbeginning of the encounter shone with an angry gleam. But the wrathful\r\nfire quickly died.\r\n\r\n“On the whole, I'm not sorry,” he said. “It was an impulse that made me\r\ndo it. Our army will come and drive you away, and our house will be our\r\nown again.”\r\n\r\n“That's putting it fairly. What's the use of burning such a fine place\r\nas Bellevue? Still, we want you. Our colonel has many questions to ask\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“You can't take me.”\r\n\r\nDick judged that the crucial moment had now come. Woodville was\r\nbreathing much more heavily than he was, and seemed to be near\r\nexhaustion. Dick darted boldly in, received a swinging right and left on\r\neither jaw that cut his cheeks and made the blood flow. But he sent his\r\nright to Woodville's chin and the young Mississippian without a sound\r\ndropped to the ground, lying relaxed and flat upon his back, his white\r\nface, streaked with red, upturned to the rain.\r\n\r\nHe was so still that Dick was seized with fear lest he had killed him.\r\nHe liked this boy who had fought him so well and, grasping him by both\r\nshoulders, he shook him hard. But when he loosed him Woodville fell back\r\nflat and inert.\r\n\r\nDick heard the waters of a brook trickling down the ravine, and,\r\nsnatching off his cap, he ran to it. He filled the cap and returned just\r\nin time to see Woodville leap lightly to his feet and disappear with the\r\nspeed of a deer among the bushes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. FORREST\r\n\r\n\r\nDick dashed after the fugitive, but he had disappeared utterly, and the\r\ndense bushes impeded the pursuer. He was hot and angry that he had been\r\ndeluded so cleverly, but then came the consolation that, after all, he\r\nhad won in the fistic encounter with an antagonist worthy of anybody.\r\nAnd after this came a second thought that caused him to halt abruptly.\r\n\r\nHe and Woodville had fought it out fairly. Their fists had printed upon\r\nthe faces of each other the stamp of a mutual liking. Why should he\r\nstrive to take young Woodville before Colonel Winchester? Nothing was\r\nto be gained by it, and, as the Mississippian was in civilian's garb, he\r\nmight incur the punishment of a spy. He realized in a flash that, since\r\nhe had vindicated his own prowess, he was glad of Woodville's escape.\r\n\r\nHe turned and walked thoughtfully back up the ravine. Very little noise\r\ncame from the house and the thin spires of smoke had disappeared. He\r\nknew now that the fires had been put out with ease, thanks to his\r\nquick warning. Before starting he had recovered both his own pistol and\r\nWoodville's, and he was particularly glad to find the latter because\r\nit would be proof of his story, if proof were needed. The rain had not\r\nceased nor had the heavy darkness lifted, but the looming shadow of the\r\nbig house was sufficient guide. He found the place where he had slipped\r\ndown the bank and the torn bushes and grass showed that he had made a\r\nfine trail. He pulled himself back up by the bushes and reentered the\r\ngarden, where he was halted at once by two watchful sentries.\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant Richard Mason of Colonel Winchester's staff,” he said,\r\n“returning from the pursuit of a fugitive.”\r\n\r\nThe men knew him and they said promptly:\r\n\r\n“Pass Lieutenant Mason.”\r\n\r\nBut despite the dark they stared at him very curiously, and when he\r\nwalked on toward the piazza one of them muttered to the other:\r\n\r\n“I guess he must have overtook that fugitive he was chasin'.”\r\n\r\nDick walked up the steps upon the piazza, where some one had lighted a\r\nsmall lamp, near which stood Colonel Winchester and his staff.\r\n\r\n“Here's Dick!” exclaimed Warner in a tone of great relief.\r\n\r\n“And we thought we had lost him,” said Colonel Winchester, gladness\r\nshowing in his voice. Then he added: “My God, Dick, what have you been\r\ndoing to yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, what kind of a transformation is this?” added a major. “You've\r\ncertainly come back with a face very different from the one with which\r\nyou left us!”\r\n\r\nDick turned fiery red. He suddenly became conscious that he had a left\r\near of enormous size, purple and swollen, that his left eye was closing\r\nfast, that the blood was dripping from cuts on either cheek, that the\r\nblood had flowed down the middle of his forehead and had formed a little\r\nstalactite on the end of his nose, that his chin had been gashed in five\r\nplaces by a strong fist, and that he had contributed his share to the\r\nbloodshed of the war.\r\n\r\n“If I didn't know these were modern times,” said Warner, “I'd say that\r\nhe had just emerged from a sanguinary encounter bare-handed in the Roman\r\narena with a leopard.”\r\n\r\nDick glared at him.\r\n\r\n“It was you who gave the alarm of fire, was it not?” asked Colonel\r\nWinchester.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. I saw the man who set the fires and I pursued him through the\r\ngarden and into the ravine that runs behind it.”\r\n\r\n“Your appearance indicates that you overtook him.”\r\n\r\nDick flushed again.\r\n\r\n“I did, sir,” he replied. “I know I'm no beauty at present, but neither\r\nis he.”\r\n\r\n“It looks as if it had been a matter of fists?”\r\n\r\n“It was, sir. Both of us fired our pistols, but missed. Then we threw\r\nour weapons to one side and clashed. It was a hard and long fight, sir.\r\nHe hit like a pile driver, and he was as active as a deer. But I was\r\nlucky enough to knock him out at last.”\r\n\r\n“Then why does your face look like a huge piece of pickled beef?” asked\r\nthe incorrigible Warner mischievously.\r\n\r\n“You wait and I'll make yours look the same!” retorted Dick.\r\n\r\n“Shut up,” said Colonel Winchester. “If I catch you two fighting I may\r\nhave you both shot as an example.”\r\n\r\nDick and Warner grinned good-naturedly at each other. They knew that\r\nColonel Winchester did not dream of carrying out such a threat, and they\r\nknew also that they had no intention of fighting.\r\n\r\n“And after you knocked him out what happened?” asked the colonel.\r\n\r\nDick looked sheepish.\r\n\r\n“He lay so still I was afraid he was dead,” he replied. “I ran down to\r\na brook, filled my cap with water, and returned with it in the hope\r\nof reviving him. I got there just in time to see him vanishing in the\r\nbushes. Pursuit was hopeless.”\r\n\r\n“He was clever,” said the Colonel. “Have you any idea who he was?”\r\n\r\n“He told me. He was Victor Woodville, the son of Colonel John Woodville,\r\nC.S.A., the owner of this house.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Colonel Winchester, and then after a moment's thought he\r\nadded: “It's just as well he escaped. I should not have known what to do\r\nwith him. But we have you, Dick, to thank for giving the alarm. Now, go\r\ninside and change to some dry clothes, if you have any in your baggage,\r\nand if not dry yourself before a fire they're going to build in the\r\nkitchen.”\r\n\r\n“Will you pardon me for speaking of something, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. Go ahead.”\r\n\r\n“I think the appearance of young Woodville here indicates the nearness\r\nof Forrest or some other strong cavalry force.”\r\n\r\n“You're right, Dick, my officers and I are agreed upon it. I have\r\ndoubled the watch, but now get yourself to that fire and then to sleep.”\r\n\r\nDick obeyed gladly enough. The night had turned raw and chill, and the\r\ncold water dripped from his clothes as he walked. But first he produced\r\nWoodville's pistol and handed it to Colonel Winchester.\r\n\r\n“There's my antagonist's pistol, sir,” he said. “You'll see his initials\r\non it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, here they are,” said Colonel Winchester: “'V.W., C.S.A.' It's a\r\nfine weapon, but it's yours, Dick, as you captured it.”\r\n\r\nDick took it and went to the kitchen, where the big fire had just begun\r\nto blaze. He was lucky enough to be the possessor of an extra uniform,\r\nand before he changed into it--they slept with their clothes on--he\r\nroasted himself before those glorious coals. Then, as he was putting on\r\nthe fresh uniform, Warner and Pennington appeared.\r\n\r\n“What would you recommend as best for the patient, Doctor,” said Warner\r\ngravely to Pennington.\r\n\r\n“I think such a distinguished surgeon as you will agree with me that his\r\nwounds should first be washed and bathed thoroughly in cold water.”\r\n\r\n“And after that a plentiful application of soothing liniment.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Doctor. That is the best we can do with the simple medicines we\r\nhave, but it especially behooves us to reduce the size of that left ear,\r\nor some of the boys will say that we have a case of elephantiasis on our\r\nhands.”\r\n\r\n“While you're reducing the size of it you might also reduce the pain in\r\nit,” said Dick.\r\n\r\n“We will,” said Pennington; “we've got some fine horse liniment here.\r\nI brought it all the way from Nebraska with me, and if it's good for\r\nhorses it ought to be good for prize fighters, too. That was surely a\r\nhefty chap who fought you. If you didn't have his pistol as proof I'd\r\nsay that he gave you a durned good licking. Isn't this a pretty cut down\r\nthe right cheek bone, George?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly, but nothing can take away the glory of that left ear.\r\nWhy, if Dick could only work his ears he could fan himself with it\r\nbeautifully. When I meet that Woodville boy I'm going to congratulate\r\nhim. He was certainly handy with his fists.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, fellows,” said Dick, good-naturedly. “In a week I won't have a\r\nwound or a sign of a scar. Then I'll remember what you've said to me and\r\nI'll lick you both, one after the other.”\r\n\r\n“Patient is growing delirious, don't you think so, Doctor?” said Warner\r\nto Pennington.\r\n\r\n“Beyond a doubt. Violent talk is always proof of it. Better put him to\r\nbed. Spread his two blankets before the fire, and he can sleep there,\r\nwhile every particle of cold and stiffness is being roasted out of him.”\r\n\r\n“You boys are very good to me,” said Dick gratefully.\r\n\r\n“It's done merely in the hope that your gratitude will keep you from\r\ngiving us the licking you promised,” said Pennington.\r\n\r\nThen they left him and Dick slept soundly until he was awakened the next\r\nday by Warner. The fire was out, the rain had ceased long since and the\r\nsun was shining brilliantly.\r\n\r\n“Hop up, Dick,” said Warner briskly. “Breakfast's ready. Owing to your\r\nwound we let you sleep until the last moment. Come now, take the foaming\r\ncoffee and the luscious bacon, and we'll be off, leaving Bellevue again\r\nto its masters, if they will come and claim it.”\r\n\r\n“Has anything happened in the night?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing since you ran your face against a pile driver, but Sergeant\r\nDaniel Whitley, who reads the signs of earth and air and wood and water,\r\nthinks that something is going to happen.”\r\n\r\n“Is it Forrest?”\r\n\r\n“Don't know, but it's somebody or something. As soon as we can eat our\r\nluxurious breakfasts we mean to mount and ride hard toward Grant. We're\r\nscouts, but according to Whitley the scouts are scouted, and this is a\r\nbad country to be trapped in.”\r\n\r\nDick was so strong and his blood was so pure that he felt his wounds\r\nbut little now. The cuts and bruises were healing fast and he ate with a\r\nkeen appetite. He heard then of the signs that Whitley had seen. He had\r\nfound two broad trails, one three miles from the house, and the other\r\nabout four miles. Each indicated the passage of several hundred men, but\r\nhe had no way of knowing whether they belonged to the same force. They\r\nwere bound to be Confederate cavalry as Colonel Winchester's regiment\r\nwas known to be the only Union force in that section.\r\n\r\nDick knew their position to be dangerous. Colonel Winchester had done\r\nhis duty in discovering that Forrest and Wheeler were raiding through\r\nMississippi, and that a heavy force was gathering in the rear of Grant,\r\nwho intended the siege of Vicksburg. It behooved him now to reach Grant\r\nas soon as he could with his news.\r\n\r\nRefreshed and watchful, the regiment rode away from Bellevue. Dick\r\nlooked back at the broad roof and the great piazzas, and then he thought\r\nof young Woodville with a certain sympathy. They had fought a good fight\r\nagainst each other, and he hoped they would meet after the war and be\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nIt was about an hour after sunrise, and the day was bright and warm. The\r\nbeads of water that stood on every leaf and blade of grass were drying\r\nfast, and the air, despite its warmth, was pure and bracing. Dick, as\r\nhe looked at the eight hundred men, tanned, experienced and thoroughly\r\narmed, under capable leaders, felt that they were a match for any roving\r\nSouthern force.\r\n\r\n“Just let Forrest come on,” he said. “I know that the Colonel is aching\r\nto get back at him for that surprise in Tennessee, and I believe we\r\ncould whip him.”\r\n\r\n“You're showing great spirit for a man who was beaten up in the prize\r\nring as you were last night. I thought you'd want to rest for a few\r\ndays.”\r\n\r\n“Drop it, George. I did get some pretty severe cuts and bruises, but I\r\nwas lucky enough to have the services of two very skillful and devoted\r\nyoung physicians. Their treatment was so fine that I'm all right\r\nto-day.”\r\n\r\n“Unless I miss my guess, we'll need the services of doctors again before\r\nnight comes. No mountains are here, but this is a great country for\r\nambush. It's mostly in forest, and even in the open the grass is already\r\nvery tall. Besides, there are so many streams, bayous, and ponds. Notice\r\nhow far out on the flanks the skirmishers and scouts are riding, and\r\nothers ride just as far ahead.”\r\n\r\nTwo miles from Bellevue and they came to a small hill, covered with\r\nforest, from the protection of which the officers examined the country\r\nlong and minutely, while their men remained hidden among the deep\r\nfoliaged trees. Dick had glasses of his own which he put to his eyes,\r\nbringing nearer the wilderness, broken here and there by open spaces\r\nthat indicated cotton fields. Yet the forest was so dense and there\r\nwas so much of it that a great force might easily be hidden within its\r\ndepths only a mile away.\r\n\r\n“Have we any information at all about Forrest's strength?” whispered\r\nPennington to Dick.\r\n\r\n“His full force isn't down here. It is believed he has not more than a\r\nthousand or twelve hundred men. But he and his officers know the country\r\nthoroughly, and of course the inhabitants, being in full sympathy with\r\nthem, will give them all the information they need. The news of every\r\nmovement of ours has been carried straight to the rebel general.”\r\n\r\n“And yet the country seems to have no people at all. We come to but few\r\nhouses, and those few are deserted.”\r\n\r\n“So they are. What was that? Did you see it, Frank?”\r\n\r\n“What was what?”\r\n\r\n“I forgot that you are not using glasses. I caught a momentary glitter\r\nin the woods. I think it was a sunbeam passing through the leaves and\r\nstriking upon the polished barrel of a rifle. Ah! there it is again! And\r\nColonel Winchester has seen it too.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel and his senior officers were now gazing intently at the\r\npoint in the wood where Dick had twice seen the gleam, and, keener-eyed\r\nthan they, he continued to search the leafy screen through his own\r\nglasses. Soon he saw bayonets, rifles, horses and men advancing swiftly,\r\nand then came two of their own scouts galloping.\r\n\r\n“The enemy is advancing!” they cried. “It's Forrest!”\r\n\r\nA thrill shot through Dick. The name of Forrest was redoubtable, but\r\nhe knew that every man in the regiment was glad to meet him again. He\r\nglanced at Colonel Winchester and saw that his face had flushed. He knew\r\nthat the colonel was more than gratified at this chance.\r\n\r\n“We'll make our stand here,” said Colonel Winchester. “The hill runs to\r\nthe right, and, as you see over there, it is covered with forest without\r\nundergrowth. Thus we can secure protection, and at the same time be able\r\nto maneuver, mounted.”\r\n\r\nThe regiment was posted rapidly in two long lines, the second to fire\r\nbetween the intervals of the first. They carried carbines and heavy\r\ncavalry sabers, and they were the best mounted regiment in the Northern\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nYet these men, brave and skillful as they were, were bound to feel\r\ntrepidation, although they did not show it. They were far in the\r\nSouthern forest, cut off from their army, and Forrest, in addition\r\nto his own cavalry, might have brought with him fresh reserves of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nDick, Warner, and Pennington, as usual, remained close to their colonel,\r\nand Sergeant Daniel Whitley was not far away. But Colonel Winchester\r\npresently rode along the double line of his veterans, and he spoke to\r\nthem quietly but with emphasis and conviction:\r\n\r\n“My lads,” he said, “you see Forrest's men coming through the woods to\r\nattack us. Forrest is the greatest cavalry leader the South has, west of\r\nthe Alleghanies. Some of you were with me when we were surprised and cut\r\nup by him in Tennessee. But you will not be surprised by him now, nor\r\nwill you be cut up by him. All of you have become great riders, a match\r\nfor Forrest's own, and as I look upon your faces here I know that there\r\nis no fear in a single heart. You have served under Grant, and you have\r\nserved under Thomas. They are two generals who always set their faces\r\ntoward the front and never turn them toward the rear. You will this day\r\nprove yourselves worthy of Grant and Thomas.”\r\n\r\nThey were about to cheer, but he checked it with the simple gesture of\r\na raised hand. Then they did a thing that only a beloved leader could\r\ninspire. Every man in the regiment, resting his carbine across the\r\npommel of his saddle, drew his heavy cavalry saber and made it whirl in\r\ncoils of glittering light about his head.\r\n\r\nThe great pulse in Dick's throat leaped as he saw. The long double line\r\nseemed to give back a double flash of flame. Not a word was said, and\r\nthen eight hundred sabers rattled together as they were dropped back\r\ninto their scabbards. Colonel Winchester's face flushed deeply at the\r\nsplendid salute, but he did not speak either. He took off his cap and\r\nswept it in a wide curve to all his men. Then he turned his face toward\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Southern trumpet was singing in the forest, and the force of\r\nForrest, about twelve hundred strong, was emerging into view. Dick,\r\nthrough his glasses, saw and recognized the famous leader, a powerful,\r\nbearded man, riding a great bay horse. He had heard many descriptions of\r\nhim and he knew him instinctively. He also recognized the fact that the\r\nWinchester regiment had before it the most desperate work any men could\r\ndo, if it beat off Forrest when he came in his own country with superior\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nNeither side had artillery, not even the light guns that could be\r\ncarried horse- or muleback. It must be left to carbine and saber.\r\nColonel Winchester carefully watched his formidable foe, trying to\r\ndivine every trick and expedient that he might use. He had a memory to\r\navenge. He had news to carry to Grant, and Forrest must not keep\r\nhim from carrying it. Moreover, his regiment and he would gain great\r\nprestige if they could beat off Forrest. There would be glory for the\r\nwhole Union cavalry if they drove back the Southern attack. Dick saw the\r\nglitter of his colonel's eye and the sharp compression of his lips.\r\n\r\nBut the men of Forrest, although nearly within rifle shot, did not\r\ncharge. Their bugle sang again, but Dick did not know what the tune\r\nmeant. Then they melted away into the deep forest on their flank, and\r\nsome of the troop thought they had gone, daunted by the firm front of\r\ntheir foe.\r\n\r\nBut Dick knew better. Forrest would never retreat before an inferior\r\nforce, and he was full of wiles and stratagems. Dick felt like a\r\nprimitive man who knew that he was being stalked by a saber-toothed\r\ntiger through the dense forest.\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester beckoned to Sergeant Whitley. “Pick a half-dozen\r\nsharp-eyed men,” he said, “and ride into those woods. You're experienced\r\nin this kind of war, Whitley, and before you go tell me what you think.”\r\n\r\n“General Forrest, sir, besides fighting as a white man fights, fights\r\nlike an Indian, too; that is, he uses an Indian's cunning, which is\r\nalways meant for ambush and surprise. He isn't dreaming of going away.\r\nThey're coming back through the thick woods.”\r\n\r\n“So I think. But let me know as soon as you can.”\r\n\r\nTen minutes after the sergeant had ridden forward with his comrades they\r\nheard the sound of rapid rifle shots, and then they saw the little band\r\ngalloping back.\r\n\r\n“They're coming, sir,” reported the sergeant. “Forrest has dismounted\r\nseveral hundred of his men, and they are creeping forward from tree to\r\ntree with their rifles, while the others hold their horses in the rear.”\r\n\r\n“Then it's an Indian fight for the present,” said Colonel Winchester.\r\n“We'll do the same.”\r\n\r\nHe rapidly changed his lines of battle. The entire front rank was\r\ndismounted, while those behind held their horses. The four hundred in\r\nfront, spreading out in as long a line as possible in order to protect\r\ntheir flanks, took shelter behind the trees and awaited the onset.\r\n\r\nThe attack was not long in coming. The Southern sharpshooters, creeping\r\nfrom tree to tree, began to fire. Scores of rifles cracked and Dick,\r\nfrom a convenient place behind a tree, saw the spouts of flame appearing\r\nalong a line of four or five hundred yards. Bullets whizzed about him,\r\nand, knowing that he would not be needed at present for any message, he\r\nhugged the friendly bark more tightly.\r\n\r\n“It's lucky we have plenty of trees,” said a voice from the shelter of\r\nthe tree next to him. “We have at least one for every officer and man.”\r\n\r\nIt was Warner who spoke and he was quite cheerful. Like Colonel\r\nWinchester, he seemed to look forward to the combat with a certain joy,\r\nand he added:\r\n\r\n“You'll take notice, Dick, old man, that we've not been surprised.\r\nForrest hasn't galloped over us as he did before. He's taking the\r\ntrouble to make the approach with protected riflemen. Now what is the\r\nsergeant up to?”\r\n\r\nSergeant Whitley, after whispering a little with Colonel Winchester,\r\nhad stolen off toward the right with fifty picked riflemen. When they\r\nreached the verge of the open space that lay between the two sides they\r\nthrew themselves down in the thick, tall grass. Neither Dick nor Warner\r\ncould see them now. They beheld only the stems of the grass waving as if\r\nunder a gentle wind. But Dick knew that the rippling movement marked the\r\npassage of the riflemen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the attack in their front was growing hotter. At least six\r\nor seven hundred sharpshooters were sending a fire which would have\r\nannihilated them if it had not been for the trees. As it was, fragments\r\nof bark, twigs, and leaves showered about them. The whistling of the\r\nbullets and their chugging as they struck the trees made a continuous\r\nsinister note.\r\n\r\nThe Union men were not silent under this fire. Their own rifles were\r\nreplying fast, but Colonel Winchester continually urged them to take\r\naim, and, while death and wounds were inflicted on the Union ranks, the\r\nSouthern were suffering in the same manner.\r\n\r\nDick turned his eyes toward the right flank, where the fifty picked\r\nriflemen, Sergeant Whitley at their head, were crawling through the\r\ntall grass. He knew that they were making toward a little corner of the\r\nforest, thrust farther forward than the rest, and presently when the\r\nrippling in the grass ceased he was sure that they had reached it. Then\r\nthe fifty rifles cracked together and the Southern flank was swept by\r\nfifty well-aimed bullets. Lying in their covert, Whitley's men reloaded\r\ntheir breech-loading rifles and again sent in a deadly fire.\r\n\r\nThe main Northern force redoubled its efforts at the same time. The men\r\nin blue sent in swarms of whistling bullets and Dick saw the front line\r\nof the South retreating.\r\n\r\n“We're rousing the wolves from their lairs,” explained Pennington\r\nexultantly as he sprang from his tree, just in time for a bullet to send\r\nhis hat flying from his head. Fortunately, it clipped only a lock of\r\nhair, but he received in a good spirit Warner's admonishing words:\r\n\r\n“Don't go wild, Frank. We've merely repelled the present attack. You\r\ndon't think that Forrest with superior forces is going to let us alone,\r\ndo you?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don't,” replied Pennington, “and don't you get behind that tree.\r\nIt's mine, and I'm coming back to it. I've earned it. I held it against\r\nall kinds of bullets. Look at the scars made on each side of it by rebel\r\nlead.”\r\n\r\nThe firing now died. Whitley's flank movement had proved wholly\r\nsuccessful, and Colonel Winchester reinforced him in the little forest\r\npeninsula with fifty more picked men, where they lay well hidden, a\r\nformidable force for any assailant.\r\n\r\nThe silence now became complete, save for the stamping of the impatient\r\nhorses and the drone of insects in the woods and grass. Dick, lying\r\non his stomach and using his glasses, could see nothing in the forest\r\nbefore them. It was to him in all its aspects an Indian battle, and he\r\nbelieved in spite of what Warner had said that the enemy had retired\r\npermanently.\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester and all the officers rose to their feet presently and\r\nwalked among the trees. No bullets came to tell them that they were\r\nrash and then the senior officers held a conference, while all the men\r\nremounted, save a dozen or so who would ride no more. But the colonel\r\ndid not abate one whit of his craft or caution.\r\n\r\nThey resumed the march toward Grant, but they avoided every field or\r\nopen space. They would make curves and lose time in order to keep in the\r\ndense wood, but, as Dick knew, Colonel Winchester still suspected that\r\nForrest was hovering somewhere on his flank, covered by the great forest\r\nand awaiting a favorable opportunity to attack.\r\n\r\nThey approached one of the deep and narrow streams that ultimately\r\nfind their way to the Mississippi. It had only one ford, and the scouts\r\ngalloping back informed them that the farther shore was held by a\r\npowerful force of cavalry.\r\n\r\n“It's Forrest,” said Colonel Winchester with quiet conviction. “Knowing\r\nevery path of the woods, they've gone ahead of us, and they mean to cut\r\nus off from Grant. Nevertheless we'll make a way.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke firmly, but the junior officers of the staff did not exactly\r\nsee how they were going to force a ford defended by a larger number of\r\ncavalry under the redoubtable Forrest.\r\n\r\n“I didn't think Forrest would let us alone, and he hasn't,” said\r\nPennington.\r\n\r\n“No, he hasn't,” said Warner, “and it seems that he's checkmated us,\r\ntoo. Why, that river is swollen by the rains so much that it's a hard\r\njob to cross it if no enemy were on the other side. But you'll note,\r\nalso, that the enemy, having got to the other side, can't come back\r\nagain in our face to attack us.”\r\n\r\n“But we want to go on and they don't,” said Dick. “They're satisfied\r\nwith the enforced status quo, and we're not. Am I right, Professor?”\r\n\r\n“You certainly are,” replied Warner. “Now, our colonel is puzzled, as\r\nyou can tell by his looks, and so would I be, despite my great natural\r\nmilitary talents.”\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment fell back into the woods, leaving the two\r\nforces out of rifle shot of each other. Sentinels were posted by both\r\ncommanders not far from the river and the rest, dismounting, took their\r\nease, save the officers, who again went into close conference.\r\n\r\nAfterward they sat among the trees and waited. It was low ground, with\r\nthe earth yet soaked from the heavy rain of the night before, and the\r\nheat grew heavy and intense. The insects began to drone again, and once\r\nmore mosquitoes made life miserable. But the soldiers did not complain.\r\nIt was noon now, and they ate food from their knapsacks. Two springs of\r\nclear water were found a little distance from the river and all drank\r\nthere. Then they went back to their weary waiting.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the river they could see the dismounted troopers,\r\nplaying cards, sleeping or currying their horses. They seemed to be in\r\nno hurry at all. Colonel Winchester sent divisions of scouts up and down\r\nthe stream, and, both returning after a while, reported that the river\r\nwas not fordable anywhere.\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester sat down under a tree and smoked his pipe. The longer\r\nhe smoked the more corrugated his brow became. He looked angrily at the\r\nford, but it would be folly to attempt a passage there, and, containing\r\nhimself as best he could, he waited while the long afternoon waned. His\r\nmen at least would get a good rest.\r\n\r\nDick and his comrades, selecting the dryest place they could find,\r\nspread their blankets and lay down. Protecting their faces from the\r\nmosquitoes with green leaves, they sank into a deep quiet. Dick even\r\ndrowsed for a while. He could not think of a way out of the trap, and\r\nhe was glad it was the duty of older men like Colonel Winchester and the\r\nmajors and captains to save them.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the day increased with the coming of afternoon, and Dick's\r\neyelids grew heavier. He had become so thoroughly hardened to march and\r\nbattle that the presence of the enemy on the other side of a river did\r\nnot disturb him. What was the use of bothering about the rebels as long\r\nas they did not wish to fire upon one?\r\n\r\nHis eyes closed for a few minutes, and then his dreaming mind traversed\r\nspace with incredible rapidity. He was back in Pendleton, sitting on\r\nthe portico with his mother, watching the flowers on the lawn nod in the\r\ngentle wind. His cousin Harry Kenton saluted him with a halloo and came\r\nbounding toward the porch, and the halloo caused Dick to awake and sit\r\nup. He rubbed his eyes violently and looked around a little bit ashamed.\r\nBut two captains older than himself were sound asleep with their backs\r\nagainst trees.\r\n\r\nDick stood up and shook himself violently. Whatever others might do he\r\nmust not allow himself to relax so much. He saw that the sun was slowly\r\ndescending and that the full heat of the afternoon was passing. Colonel\r\nWinchester had withdrawn somewhat among the trees and he beckoned to\r\nhim. Sergeant Whitley was standing beside the colonel.\r\n\r\n“Dick,” said Colonel Winchester, “colored men have brought us news that\r\nColonel Grierson of our army, with a strong raiding force of nearly two\r\nthousand cavalry is less than a day's march away and on the same side\r\nof this river that we are. We have received the news from three separate\r\nsources and it must be true. Probably Forrest's men know it, too, but\r\nexpect Grierson to pass on, wholly ignorant that we're here. I have\r\nchosen you and Sergeant Whitley to bring Grierson to our relief. The\r\nhorses are ready. Now go, and God speed you. The sergeant will tell you\r\nwhat we know as you ride.”\r\n\r\nDick sprang at once into the saddle, and with a brief good-bye he and\r\nthe sergeant were soon in the forest riding toward the southeast. Dick\r\nwas alive and energetic again. All that laziness of mind and body was\r\ngone. He rode on a great ride and every sense was alert.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” he said, “just about what the news is.”\r\n\r\n“Three men,” replied the sergeant, “came in at different times with\r\ntales, but the three tales agree. Grierson has made a great raid, even\r\nfurther down than we have gone. He has more than double our numbers, and\r\nif we can unite with him it's likely that we can turn Forrest into the\r\npursued instead of the pursuer. They say we can hit his trail about\r\ntwenty-five miles from here, and if that's so we'll bring him up to the\r\nford by noon to-morrow. Doesn't it look promising to you, Lieutenant\r\nMason?”\r\n\r\n“It does look promising, Sergeant Whitley, if we don't happen to be\r\ntaken by the Johnnies who infest this region. Besides, you'll have to\r\nguide through the dark to-night. You're trained to that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\n“You can see pretty well in the dark yourself, sir; and since our way\r\nlies almost wholly through forest I see no reason why we should be\r\ncaptured.”\r\n\r\n“That's so, sergeant. I'm just as much of an optimist as you are. You\r\nkeep the course, and I'm with you to the finish.”\r\n\r\nThey rode rather fast at first as the sun had not yet set, picking their\r\nway through the woods, and soon left their comrades out of sight. The\r\ntwilight now came fast, adding a mournful and somber red to the vast\r\nexpanse of wilderness. The simile of an Indian fight returned to Dick\r\nwith increased force. This was not like any battle with white men in\r\nthe open fields. It was a combat of raiders who advanced secretly under\r\ncover of the vast wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe twilight died with the rapidity of the South, and the darkness,\r\nthick at the early hours, passed over the curve of the earth. For a time\r\nDick and the sergeant could not see many yards in front and they rode\r\nvery slowly. After a while, as the sky lightened somewhat and their eyes\r\nalso grew keen, they made better speed. Then they struck a path through\r\nthe woods leading in the right direction, and they broke into a trot.\r\n\r\nThe earth was so soft that their horses' feet gave back but little\r\nsound, and both were confident they would not meet any enemy in the\r\nnight at least.\r\n\r\n“Straight southeast,” said the sergeant, “and we're bound to strike\r\nGrierson's tracks. After that we'd be blind if we couldn't follow the\r\ntrail made by nearly two thousand horsemen.”\r\n\r\nThe path still led in the direction they wished and they rode on\r\nsilently for hours. Once they saw a farmhouse set back in the woods, and\r\nthey were in fear lest dogs come out and bark alarm, but there was no\r\nsound and they soon left it far behind.\r\n\r\nThey passed many streams, some of which were up to their saddle girths,\r\nand then they entered a road which was often so deep in mud that they\r\nwere compelled to turn into the woods on the side. But no human being\r\nhad interfered with their journey, and their hopes rose to the zenith.\r\n\r\nThey came, finally, into an open region of cotton fields, and the\r\nsergeant now began to watch closely for the great trail they hoped to\r\nfind. A force as large as Grierson's would not attempt a passage through\r\nthe woods, but would seek some broad road and Sergeant Whitley expected\r\nto find it long before morning.\r\n\r\nIt was now an hour after midnight and they reckoned that they had come\r\nabout the right distance. There was a good moon and plenty of stars and\r\nthe sergeant gave himself only a half-hour to find the trail.\r\n\r\n“There's bound to be a wide road somewhere among these fields, the kind\r\nwe call a county road.”\r\n\r\n“It's over there beyond that rail fence,” said Dick. They urged their\r\nhorses into a trot, and soon found that Dick was right. A road of red\r\nclay soft from the rains stretched before them.\r\n\r\n“A man doesn't have to look twice here for a trail. See,” said the\r\nsergeant.\r\n\r\nThe road from side to side was plowed deep with the hoofs of horses,\r\nevery footprint pointing northward.\r\n\r\n“Grierson's cavalry,” said Dick.\r\n\r\n“I take it that it can't be anything else. There is certainly in these\r\nparts no rebel force of cavalry large enough to make this trail.”\r\n\r\n“How old would you say these tracks are?”\r\n\r\n“Hard to tell, but they can't have been made many hours ago. We'll press\r\nforward, lieutenant, and we can save time going through the fields on\r\nthe edge of the road.”\r\n\r\nAlthough they had to take down fences they made good speed and just\r\nas the sun was rising they saw the light of a low campfire among some\r\ntrees, lining either bank of a small creek. They approached warily,\r\nuntil they saw the faded blue uniforms. Then they galloped forward,\r\nshouting that they were friends, and in a few minutes were in the\r\npresence of Grierson himself.\r\n\r\nHe had been making a great raid, but he was eager now for the\r\nopportunity to strike at Forrest. He must give his horses a short rest,\r\nand then Dick and the sergeant should guide him at speed to the ford\r\nwhere the opposing forces stood.\r\n\r\n“It's twenty-five miles, you tell me?” said Grierson to Dick.\r\n\r\n“As nearly as I can calculate, sir. It's through swampy country, but I\r\nthink we ought to be there in three or four hours.”\r\n\r\n“Then lead the way,” said Grierson. “Like your colonel, I'll be glad to\r\nhave a try at Forrest.”\r\n\r\nSergeant Whitley rode in advance. A lumberman first and then a soldier\r\nof the plains, he had noted even in the darkness every landmark and he\r\ncould lead the way back infallibly. But he warned Grierson that such a\r\nman as Forrest would be likely to have out scouts, even if they had to\r\nswim the river. It was likely that they could not get nearer by three or\r\nfour miles to Colonel Winchester without being seen.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Grierson, who had the spirit of a Stuart or a Forrest,\r\n“we'll ride straight on, brushing these watchers out of our way, and if\r\nby any chance their whole force should cross, we'll just meet and fight\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“The little river is falling fast,” said the sergeant. “It's likely that\r\nit'll be fordable almost anywhere by noon.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Grierson, “it'll be all the easier for us to get at the\r\nenemy.”\r\n\r\nDick, just behind Grierson, heard these words and he liked them. Here\r\nwas a spirit like Colonel Winchester's own, or like that of the great\r\nSouthern cavalry leaders. The Southerners were born on horseback, but\r\nthe Northern men were acquiring the same trick of hard riding. Dick\r\nglanced back at the long column. Armed with carbine and saber the men\r\nwere riding their trained horses like Comanches. Eager and resolute\r\nit was a formidable force, and his heart swelled with pride and\r\nanticipation. He believed that they were going to give Forrest all he\r\nwanted and maybe a little more.\r\n\r\nUp rose the sun. Hot beams poured over forest and field, but the\r\ncavalrymen still rode fast, the scent of battle in their nostrils. Dick\r\nknew that these Southern streams, flooded by torrents of rain, rose fast\r\nand also fell fast.\r\n\r\n“How much further now, sergeant?” asked Grierson, as they turned from a\r\npath into the deep woods.\r\n\r\n“Not more than three miles, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And they know we're coming. Listen to that!”\r\n\r\nSeveral rifles cracked among the trees and bullets whizzed by them.\r\nForrest's skirmishers and scouts were on the south side of the stream.\r\nAs they had foreseen, the river had sunk so much that it was fordable\r\nnow at many points. Dick was devoutly grateful that they had found\r\nGrierson. Otherwise the Winchester regiment would have been flanked, and\r\nits destruction would have followed.\r\n\r\nSkirmishers were detached from Grierson's command and drove off the\r\nSouthern riflemen. Dick heard the rattling fire of their rifles in the\r\ndeep wood, but he seldom saw a figure. Then he heard another fire, heavy\r\nand continuous, in their front, coming quite clearly on a breeze that\r\nblew toward them.\r\n\r\n“Your whole regiment is engaged,” exclaimed Grierson. “Forrest must have\r\nforded the river elsewhere!”\r\n\r\nHe turned and shook aloft his saber.\r\n\r\n“Forward, lads!” he shouted. “Gallant men of our own army will be\r\noverwhelmed unless we get up in time!”\r\n\r\nThe whole force broke into a gallop through the woods, the fire in their\r\nfront rapidly growing heavier. In ten minutes they would be there, but\r\nrifles suddenly blazed from the forest on their flank and many saddles\r\nwere emptied. Nothing upsets like surprise, and for a few moments the\r\nwhole command was in disorder. It was evident that Forrest was attacking\r\nWinchester with only a part of his force, while he formed an ambush for\r\nGrierson.\r\n\r\nBut the Northern cavalrymen had not learned in vain through disaster and\r\nexperience. Grierson quickly restored order and drew his men back into\r\nthe forest. As the enemy followed the Northern carbines began to flash\r\nfast. The troopers in gray were unable to flank them or drive them back.\r\nGrierson, sure of his superior numbers, pushed on toward Winchester,\r\nwhile fighting off the foe at the same time.\r\n\r\nDick and the sergeant kept in the van, and presently they came within\r\nsight of Colonel Winchester's men, who, dismounted, were holding off as\r\nbest they could the overwhelming attack of Forrest. The Southern leader,\r\nafter sending the majority of his men to a new crossing lower down had\r\nforced the ford before the Winchester regiment, and would have crushed\r\nit if it had not been for the opportune arrival of Grierson.\r\n\r\nBut a tremendous cheer arose as the Northern cavalry leader, who was\r\nalready proving his greatness, charged into the battle with his grim\r\ntroopers. The men in blue were now more numerous, and, fighting with the\r\nresolve to win or die, they gradually forced back Forrest. Dick began to\r\nforesee a victory won over the great Southern cavalryman.\r\n\r\nBut the astute Forrest, seeing that the odds were now heavily against\r\nhim, ordered a retreat. The trumpets sang the recall and suddenly\r\nthe Southern horsemen, carrying their dead with them, vanished in the\r\nforest, where the Northern cavalry, fearful of ambushes and new forces,\r\ndid not dare to pursue.\r\n\r\nBut Winchester and Grierson were shaking hands, and Winchester thanked\r\nthe other in brief but emphatic words.\r\n\r\n“Say no more, colonel,” exclaimed Grierson. “We're all trying to serve\r\nour common country. You'd help me just the same if we had the chance,\r\nand I think you'll find the road clear to Grant. While the siege of\r\nVicksburg was determined on long ago, as you know, I believe that he is\r\nnow moving toward Grand Gulf. You know he has to deal with the armies of\r\nJohnston and Pemberton.”\r\n\r\n“We'll find him,” said Winchester.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later his regiment was galloping toward Grant,\r\nwhile Grierson's command rode eastward to deal with other forces of the\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. GRANT MOVES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment had not suffered greatly. A dozen men who had\r\nfallen were given speedy burial, and all the wounded were taken away on\r\nhorseback by their friends. Dick rejoiced greatly at their escape from\r\nForrest, and the daring and skill of Grierson. He felt anew that he was\r\nin stronger hands in the West than he had been in the East. In the East\r\nthings seemed to go wrong nearly always, and the West they seemed to\r\ngo right nearly always. It could not be chance continued so long. He\r\nbelieved in his soul that it was Grant, the heroic Thomas, and the great\r\nfighting powers of the western men, used to all the roughness of life\r\nout-of-doors and on the border.\r\n\r\nThey turned their course toward the Mississippi and that afternoon they\r\nmet a Union scout who told them that Grant, now in the very heart of the\r\nfar South, was gathering his forces for a daring attack upon Grand\r\nGulf, a Confederate fortress on the Mississippi. In the North and at\r\nWashington his venture was regarded with alarm. There was a telegram\r\nto him to stop, but it was sent too late. He had disappeared in the\r\nSouthern wilderness.\r\n\r\nBut Dick understood. He had both knowledge and intuition. Colonel\r\nWinchester on his long and daring scout had learned that the Confederate\r\nforces in the South were scattered and their leaders in doubt. Grant,\r\ntaking a daring offensive and hiding his movements, had put them on the\r\ndefensive, and there were so many points to defend that they did not\r\nknow which to choose. Joe Johnston, just recovered from his wound at\r\nFair Oaks the year before, and a general of the first rank, was coming,\r\nbut he was not yet here.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pemberton held the chief command, but he seemed to lack energy\r\nand decision. There were forces under other generals scattered along the\r\nriver, including eight thousand commanded by Bowen, who held Grand Gulf,\r\nbut concert of action did not exist among them.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge was not Dick's alone. It extended to every man in\r\nthe regiment, and when the colonel urged them to greater speed they\r\nresponded gladly.\r\n\r\n“If we don't ride faster,” he said, “we won't be up in time for the\r\ntaking of Grand Gulf.”\r\n\r\nNo greater spur was needed and the Winchester regiment went forward as\r\nfast as horses could carry them.\r\n\r\n“I take it that Grant means to scoop in the Johnnies in detail,” said\r\nWarner.\r\n\r\n“It seems so,” said Pennington. “This is a big country down here, and we\r\ncan fight one Confederate army while another is mired up a hundred miles\r\naway.\r\n\r\n“That's General Grant's plan. He doesn't look like any hero of romance,\r\nbut he acts like one. He plunges into the middle of the enemy, and if he\r\ngets licked he's up and at 'em again right away.”\r\n\r\nNight closed in, and they stopped at an abandoned plantation--it seemed\r\nto Dick that the houses were abandoned everywhere--where they spent the\r\nnight. The troopers would have willingly pushed on through the darkness,\r\nbut the horses were so near exhaustion that another hour or two would\r\nhave broken them down permanently. Moreover, Colonel Winchester did not\r\nfeel much apprehension of an attack now. Forrest had certainly turned\r\nin another direction, and they were too close to the Union lines to be\r\nattacked by any other foe.\r\n\r\nThe house on this plantation was not by any means so large and fine as\r\nBellevue, but, like the other, it had broad piazzas all about it, and\r\nDick, in view of his strenuous experience, was allowed to take his\r\nsaddle as a pillow and his blankets and go to sleep soon after dark in a\r\ncomfortable place against the wall.\r\n\r\nNever was slumber quicker or sweeter. There was not an unhealthy tissue\r\nin his body, and most of his nerves had disappeared in a life amid\r\nbattles, scoutings, and marchings. He slept heavily all through the\r\nnight, inhaling new strength and vitality with every breath of the\r\ncrisp, fresh air. There was no interruption this time, and early in the\r\nmorning the regiment was up and away.\r\n\r\nThey descended now into lower grounds near the Mississippi. All around\r\nthem was a vast and luxuriant vegetation, cut by sluggish streams and\r\nbayous. But the same desolation reigned everywhere. The people had fled\r\nbefore the advance of the armies. Late in the afternoon they saw pickets\r\nin blue, then the Mississippi, and a little later they rode into a Union\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n“Dick,” said Colonel Winchester, “I shall want you to go with the senior\r\nofficers and myself to report to General Grant on the other side of the\r\nMississippi. You rode on that mission to Grierson and he may want to ask\r\nyou questions.”\r\n\r\nDick was glad to go with them. He was eager to see once more the man who\r\nhad taken Henry and Donelson and who had hung on at Shiloh until Buell\r\ncame. The general's tent was in a grove on a bit of high ground, and he\r\nwas sitting before it on a little camp stool, smoking a short cigar, and\r\ngazing reflectively in the direction of Grand Gulf.\r\n\r\nHe greeted the three officers quietly but with warmth and then he\r\nlistened to Colonel Winchester's detailed account of what he had seen\r\nand learned in his raid toward Jackson. It was a long narrative, showing\r\nhow the Southern forces were scattered, and, as he listened, Grant's\r\nface began to show satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut he seldom interrupted.\r\n\r\n“And you think they have no large force at Jackson?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I'm quite sure of it,” replied Colonel Winchester.\r\n\r\nGrant chewed his cigar a little while and then said:\r\n\r\n“Grierson is doing well. It was an achievement for you and him to beat\r\noff Forrest. It will raise the prestige of our cavalry, which needs it.\r\nI believe it was you, Lieutenant Mason, who brought Grierson.”\r\n\r\n“It was chiefly, sir, a sergeant named Whitley. I rode with him and\r\noutranked him, but he is a veteran of the plains, and it was he who did\r\nthe real work.”\r\n\r\nThe general's stern features were lightened by a smile.\r\n\r\n“I'm glad you give the sergeant credit,” he said. “Not many officers\r\nwould do it.”\r\n\r\nHe listened a while longer and then the three were permitted to withdraw\r\nto their regiment, which was posted back of Grand Gulf, and which had\r\nquickly become a part of an army flushed with victory and eager for\r\nfurther action.\r\n\r\nBefore sunset Dick, Warner, and Pennington looked at Grand Gulf, a\r\nlittle village standing on high cliffs overlooking the Mississippi,\r\njust below the point where the dark stream known as the Big Black River\r\nempties into the Father of Waters. Around the crown of the heights was a\r\nring of batteries and lower down, enclosing the town, was another ring.\r\n\r\nFar off on the Mississippi the three saw puffing black smoke marking\r\nthe presence of a Union fleet, which never for one instant in the whole\r\ncourse of the war relaxed its grip of steel upon the Confederacy. Dick's\r\nheart thrilled at the sight of the brave ships. He felt then, as most of\r\nus have felt since, that whatever happened the American navy would never\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n“I hear the ships are going to bombard,” said Warner.\r\n\r\n“I heard so, too,” said Pennington, “and I heard also that they will\r\nhave to do it under the most difficult circumstances. The water in front\r\nof Grand Gulf is so deep that the ships can't anchor. It has a swift\r\ncurrent, too, making at that point more than six knots an hour. There\r\nare powerful eddies, too, and the batteries crowning the cliffs are\r\nso high that the cannon of the gunboats will have trouble in reaching\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Still, Mr. Pessimist,” said Dick, “remember what the gunboats did at\r\nFort Henry. You'll find the same kind of men here.”\r\n\r\n“I wasn't trying to discourage you. I was merely telling the worst\r\nfirst. We're going to win. We nearly always win here in the West, but it\r\nseems to me the country is against us now. This doesn't look much like\r\nthe plains, Dick, with its big, deep rivers, its high bluffs along the\r\nbanks, and its miles and miles of swamp or wet lowlands. How wide would\r\nyou say the Mississippi is here?”\r\n\r\n“Somewhere between a mile and a mile and a half.”\r\n\r\n“And they say it's two or three hundred feet deep. Look at the steamers,\r\nboys. How many are there?”\r\n\r\n“I count seven pyramids of smoke,” said Warner, “four in one group and\r\nthree in another. All the pyramids are becoming a little faint as the\r\ntwilight is advancing. Dick, you call me a cold mathematical person, but\r\nthis vast river flowing in its deep channel, the dark bluffs up there,\r\nand the vast forests would make me feel mighty lonely if you fellows\r\nwere not here. It's a long way to Vermont.”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen hundred or maybe two thousand miles,” said Dick, “but look\r\nhow fast the dark is coming. I was wrong in saying it's coming. It just\r\ndrops down. The smoke of the steamers has melted into the night, and you\r\ndon't see them any more. The surface of the river has turned black as\r\nink, the bluffs of Grand Gulf have gone, and we've turned back three or\r\nfour hundred years.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by going back three or four hundred years?” asked\r\nWarner, looking curiously at Dick.\r\n\r\n“Why, don't you see them out there?”\r\n\r\n“See them out there? See what?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the queer little ships with the high sides and prows! On my soul,\r\nGeorge, they're the caravels of Spain! Look, they're stopping! Now they\r\nlower something in black over the side of the first caravel. I see a man\r\nin a black robe like a priest, holding a cross in his hand and standing\r\nat the ship's edge saying something. I think he's praying, boys. Now\r\nsailors cut the ropes that hold the dark object. It falls into the river\r\nand disappears. It's the burial of De Soto in the Father of Waters which\r\nhe discovered!”\r\n\r\n“Dick, you're dreaming,” exclaimed Pennington.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know, but once there was a Chinaman who dreamed that he was a\r\nlily. When he woke up he didn't know whether he was a Chinaman who had\r\ndreamed he was a lily or a lily now dreaming he was a Chinaman.”\r\n\r\n“I like that story, Dick, but you've got too much imagination. The tale\r\nof the death and burial of De Soto has always been so vivid to you that\r\nyou just stood there and re-created the scene for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Of course that's it,” said Pennington, “but why can't a fellow create\r\nthings with his mind, when things that don't exist jump right up before\r\nhis eyes? I've often seen the mirage, generally about dark, far out on\r\nthe western plains. I've seen a beautiful lake and green gardens where\r\nthere was nothing but the brown swells rolling on.”\r\n\r\n“I concede all you say,” said Dick readily. “I have flashes sometimes,\r\nand so does Harry Kenton and others I know.”\r\n\r\n“Flashes! What do you mean?” asked Warner.\r\n\r\n“Why, a sort of lightning stroke out of the past. Something that lasts\r\nonly a second, but in which you have a share. Boys, one day I saw myself\r\na Carthaginian soldier following Hannibal over the Alps.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe,” said Pennington, “we have lived other lives on this earth, and\r\nsometimes a faint glimpse of them comes to us. It's just a guess.”\r\n\r\n“That's so,” said Warner, “and we'd better be getting back to the\r\nregiment. Grand Gulf defended by Bowen and eight thousand good men is\r\nreally enough for us. I think we're going to see some lively fighting\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nThe heavy boom of a cannon from the upper circle of batteries swept over\r\nthe vast sheet of water flowing so swiftly toward the Gulf. The sound\r\ncame back in dying echoes, and then there was complete silence among\r\nbesieged and besiegers.\r\n\r\nThe Winchesters had found a good solid place, a little hill among the\r\nmarshes, and they were encamped there with their horses. Dick had no\r\nmessages to carry, but he remained awake, while his comrades slept\r\nsoundly. He had slept so much the night before that he had no desire for\r\nsleep now.\r\n\r\nFrom his position he could see the Confederate bluffs and a few lights\r\nmoving there, but otherwise the two armies were under a blanket of\r\ndarkness. He again felt deeply the sense of isolation and loneliness,\r\nnot for himself alone, but for the whole army. Grant had certainly shown\r\nsupreme daring in pushing far into the South, and the government at\r\nWashington had cause for alarm lest he be reckless. If there were any\r\nstrong hand to draw together the forces of the Confederacy they could\r\nsurely crush him. But he had already learned in this war that those who\r\nstruck swift and hard were sure to win. That was Stonewall Jackson's\r\nway, and it seemed to be Grant's way, too.\r\n\r\nStill unable to sleep, he walked to a better position, where he could\r\nsee the shimmering dark of the river and the misty heights with their\r\ntwo circles of cannon. A tall figure standing there turned at his tread\r\nand he recognized Colonel Winchester.\r\n\r\n“Uneasy at our position, Dick?” said the colonel, fathoming his mind at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“A little, sir, but I think General Grant will pull us through.”\r\n\r\n“He will, Dick, and he'll take this fort, too. Grant's the hammer we've\r\nbeen looking for. Look at his record. He's had backsets, but in the end\r\nhe's succeeded in everything he's tried. The Confederate government and\r\nleaders have made a mess of their affairs in the West and Southwest, and\r\nGeneral Grant is taking full advantage of it.”\r\n\r\n“Do we attack in the morning, sir?”\r\n\r\n“We do, Dick, though not by land. Porter, with his seven gunboats, is\r\ngoing to open on the fort, but it will be a hazardous undertaking.”\r\n\r\n“Because of the nature of the river, sir?”\r\n\r\n“That's it. They can't anchor, and with full steam up, caught in all the\r\nviolent eddies that the river makes rounding the point, they'll have to\r\nfire as best they can.”\r\n\r\n“But the gunboats did great work at Fort Henry, sir.”\r\n\r\n“So they did, Dick, and we've come a long way South since then, which\r\nmeans that we're making progress and a lot of it here in the West. Well,\r\nwe'll see to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThey walked back to their own camp and sleep came to Dick at last. But\r\nhe awoke early and found that the thrill of expectation was running\r\nthrough the whole army. Their position did not yet enable them to attack\r\non land, but far out on the river they saw the gunboats moving. Porter,\r\nthe commander, divided them into two groups. Four of the gunboats were\r\nto attack the lower circle of batteries and three were to pour their\r\nfire upon the upper ring.\r\n\r\nDick by day even more than by night recognized the difficulty of the\r\ntask. Before them flowed the vast swift current of the Mississippi,\r\ngleaming now in the sunshine, and beyond were the frowning bluffs,\r\ncrested and ringed with cannon. Grant had with him twenty thousand men\r\nand his seven gunboats, and Bowen, eight thousand troops. But if the\r\naffair lasted long other Southern armies would surely come.\r\n\r\nDick and his comrades had little to do but watch and thousands watched\r\nwith them. When the sun was fully risen the seven boats steamed out in\r\ntwo groups, four farther down the river in order to attack the lower\r\nbatteries, while the other three up the stream would launch their fire\r\nagainst those on the summit.\r\n\r\nHe watched the crest of the cliffs. He saw plainly through his glasses\r\nthe muzzles of cannon and men moving about the batteries. Then there\r\nwas a sudden blaze of fire and column of smoke and a shell struck in the\r\nwater near one of the gunboats. The boat replied and its comrades also\r\nsent shot and shell toward the frowning summit. Then the batteries, both\r\nlower and upper, replied with full vigor and all the cliffs were wrapped\r\nin fire and smoke.\r\n\r\nThe boats steamed in closer and closer, pouring an incessant fire from\r\ntheir heavy guns, and both rings of batteries on the cliffs responded.\r\nThe water of the river spouted up in innumerable little geysers and now\r\nand then a boat was struck. Over both cliffs and river a great cloud\r\nof smoke lowered. It grew so dense that Dick and his comrades, watching\r\nwith eagerness, were unable to tell much of what was happening.\r\n\r\nYet as the smoke lifted or was shot through with the blaze of cannon\r\nfire they saw that their prophecies were coming true. The boats in water\r\ntoo deep for anchorage were caught in the powerful eddies and their\r\ncaptains had to show their best seamanship while they steamed back and\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nThe battle between ship and shore went on for a long time. It seemed at\r\nlast to the watching Union soldiers that the fire from the lower line of\r\nbatteries was diminishing.\r\n\r\n“We're making some way,” said Warner.\r\n\r\n“It looks like it,” said Dick. “Their lower batteries are not so well\r\nprotected as the upper.”\r\n\r\n“If we were only over there, helping with our own guns.”\r\n\r\n“But there's a big river in between, and we've got to leave it to the\r\nboats for to-day, anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“Look again at those lower batteries. Their fire is certainly\r\ndecreasing. I can see it die down.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and now it's stopped entirely. The boats have done good work!”\r\n\r\nA tremendous cheer burst from the troops on the west shore as they saw\r\nhow much their gallant little gunboats had achieved. Every gun in the\r\nlower batteries was silent now, but the top of the cliffs was still\r\nalive with flame. The batteries there were far from silent. Instead\r\ntheir fire was increasing in volume and power.\r\n\r\nThe four gunboats that had silenced the lower batteries now moved up to\r\nthe aid of their comrades, and the seven made a united effort, steaming\r\nforward in a sort of half-moon, and raining shot and shell upon the\r\nsummits. But the guns there, well-sheltered and having every advantage\r\nover rocking steamers, maintained an accurate and deadly fire. The\r\ndecks of the gunboats were swept more than once. Many men were killed or\r\nwounded. Heavy shot crashed through their sides, and Dick expected every\r\ninstant to see some one of them sunk by a huge exploding shell.\r\n\r\n“They can't win! They can't win!” he exclaimed. “They'd better draw off\r\nbefore they're sunk!”\r\n\r\n“So they had,” said Warner sadly. “Boats are at a disadvantage fighting\r\nbatteries. The old darky was right when he preferred a train wreck to a\r\nboat wreck, 'ef the train's smashed, thar you are on the solid ground,\r\nbut ef the boat blows up, whar is you?' That's sense. The boats are\r\nretiring! It's sad, but it's sense. A boat that steams away will live to\r\nfight another day.”\r\n\r\nDick was dejected. He fancied he could hear the cheering of their foes\r\nat what looked like a Union defeat, but he recalled that Grant, the\r\nbulldog, led them. He would never think of retiring, and he was sure to\r\nbe ready with some new attempt.\r\n\r\nThe gunboats drew off to the far western shore and lay there, puffing\r\nsmoke defiantly. Their fight with the batteries had lasted five hours\r\nand they had suffered severely. It seemed strange to Dick that none of\r\nthem had been sunk, and in fact it was strange. All had been hit many\r\ntimes, and one had been pierced by nearly fifty shot or shell. Their\r\nkilled or wounded were numerous, but their commanders and crews were\r\nstill resolute, and ready to go into action whenever General Grant\r\nwished.\r\n\r\n“Spunky little fellows,” said Pennington. “We don't have many boats out\r\nwhere I live, but I must hand a bunch of laurel to the navy every time.”\r\n\r\n“And you can bind wreaths around the hair of those navy fellows, too,”\r\n said Warner, “and sing songs in their honor whether they win or lose.”\r\n\r\n“Now I wonder what's next,” said Dick.\r\n\r\nTo their surprise the gunboats opened fire again just before sundown,\r\nand the batteries replied fiercely. Rolling clouds of smoke mingled\r\nwith the advancing twilight, and the great guns from either side flashed\r\nthrough the coming darkness. Then from a stray word or two dropped\r\nby Colonel Winchester Dick surmised the reason of this new and rather\r\ndistant cannonade.\r\n\r\nHe knew that General Grant had transports up the river above Grand Gulf,\r\nand he believed that they were now coming down the stream under cover of\r\nthe bombardment and the darkness. He confided his belief to Warner, who\r\nagreed with him. Presently they saw new coils of smoke in the darkness\r\nand knew they were right. The transports, steaming swiftly, were soon\r\nbeyond the range of the batteries, and then the gun boats, drawing off,\r\ndropped down the river with them.\r\n\r\nLong before the boats reached a point level with Grant's camp the army\r\nwas being formed in line for embarkation on the gunboats and transports.\r\nThe horses were to be placed on one or two of the transports and the men\r\nfilled all the other vessels.\r\n\r\n“You can't down Grant,” said Pennington. “A failure with him merely\r\nmeans that he's going to try again.”\r\n\r\n“But don't forget the navy and the Father of Waters,” said Dick, as\r\ntheir transports swung from the shore upon the dark surface of the\r\nriver. “The mighty rivers help us. Look how we went up the Cumberland\r\nand the Tennessee and now we've harnessed a flowing ocean for our\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\n“Getting poetical, Dick,” said Warner.\r\n\r\n“I feel it and so do you. You can't see the bluffs any more. There's\r\nnothing in sight, but the lights of the steamers and the transports. We\r\nmust be somewhere near the middle of the stream, because I can't make\r\nout either shore.”\r\n\r\nThere were two regiments aboard the transport, the Winchester and one\r\nfrom Ohio, which had fought by their side at both Perryville and Stone\r\nRiver. Usually these boys chattered much, but now they were silent,\r\npermeated by the same feelings that had overwhelmed Dick. In the\r\ndarkness--all lights were concealed as much as possible--with both banks\r\nof the vast river hidden from them, they felt that they were in very\r\ntruth afloat upon a flowing ocean.\r\n\r\nThey knew little about their journey, except that they were destined for\r\nthe eastern shore, the same upon which Grand Gulf stood, but they did\r\nnot worry about this lack of knowledge. They were willing to trust to\r\nGrant, and most of them were already asleep, upon the decks, in the\r\ncabins, or in any place in which a human body could secure a position.\r\n\r\nDick did not sleep. The feeling of mystery and might made by the\r\ntremendous river remained longer in his sensitive and imaginative\r\nnature. His mind, too, looked backward. He knew that the great\r\ngrandfathers of Harry Kenton and himself, the famous Henry Ware and the\r\nfamous Paul Cotter, had passed up and down this monarch of streams.\r\nHe knew of their adventures. How often had he and his cousin, who now,\r\nalas! was on the other side, listened to the stories of those mighty\r\ndays as they were handed from father to son! Those lads had floated\r\nin little boats and he was on a steamer, but it seemed to him that the\r\nriver with its mighty depths took no account of either, steamer or canoe\r\nbeing all the same to its vast volume of water.\r\n\r\nHe was standing by the rail looking over, when happening to glance back\r\nhe saw by the ship's lantern what he thought was a familiar face. A\r\nsecond glance and he was sure. He remembered that fair-haired Ohio lad,\r\nand, smiling, he said:\r\n\r\n“You're one of those Ohio boys who, marching southward from its mouth\r\nin the Ohio, drank the tributary river dry clear to its source, the\r\nmightiest achievement in quenching thirst the world has ever known.\r\nYou're the boy, too, who told about it.”\r\n\r\nThe youth moved forward, gazed at him and said:\r\n\r\n“Now I remember you, too. You're Dick Mason of the Winchester regiment.\r\nI heard the Winchesters were on board, but I haven't had time to look\r\naround. It was hot when we drank up the river, but it was hotter that\r\nafternoon at Perryville. God! what a battle! And again at Stone\r\nRiver, when the Johnnies surprised us and took us in flank. It was you\r\nKentuckians then who saved us.”\r\n\r\n“Just as you would have saved us, if it had been the other way.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so. But, Mason, we left a lot of the boys behind. A big crowd\r\nstopped forever at Perryville, and a bigger at Stone River.”\r\n\r\n“And we left many of ours, too. I suppose we'll land soon, won't we, and\r\nthen take these Grand Gulf forts with troops.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that's the ticket, but I hear, Mason, it's hard to find a landing\r\non the east side. The banks are low there and the river spreads out to\r\na vast distance. After the boats go as far as they can we'll have to get\r\noff in water up to our waists and wade through treacherous floods.”\r\n\r\nThe question of landing was worrying Grant at that time and worrying him\r\nterribly. The water spread far out over the sunken lands and he might\r\nhave to drop down the river many miles before he could find a landing on\r\nsolid ground, a fact which would scatter his army along a long line, and\r\nexpose it to defeat by the Southern land forces. But his anxieties were\r\nrelieved early in the morning when a colored man taken aboard from a\r\ncanoe told him of a bayou not five miles below Grand Gulf up which his\r\ngunboats and transports could go and find a landing for the troops on\r\nsolid ground.\r\n\r\nDick was asleep when the boats entered the bayou, but he was soon\r\nawakened by the noise of landing. It was then that most of the\r\nWinchester and of the Ohio regiment discovered that they were comrades,\r\nthrown together again by the chances of war, and there was a mighty\r\nwelcome and shaking of hands. But it did not interfere with the rapidity\r\nof the landing. The Winchester regiment was promptly ordered forward\r\nand, advancing on solid ground, took a little village without firing a\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nAll that day troops came up and Grant's army, after having gone away\r\nfrom Grand Gulf in darkness, was coming back to it in daylight.\r\n\r\n“They say that Pemberton at Vicksburg could gather together fifty\r\nthousand men and strike us, while we've only twenty thousand here,” said\r\nPennington.\r\n\r\n“But he isn't going to do it,” said Warner. “How do I know? No, I'm not\r\na prophet nor the son of a prophet. There's nothing mysterious about\r\nit. This man Grant who leads us knows the value of time. He makes up his\r\nmind fast and he acts fast. The Confederate commander doesn't do either.\r\nSo Grant is bound to win. Let z equal resolution and y equal speed and\r\nwe have z plus y which equals resolution and speed, that is victory.”\r\n\r\n“I hope it will work out that way,” said Dick, “but war isn't altogether\r\nmathematics.”\r\n\r\n“Not altogether, but that beautiful study plays a great part in every\r\ncampaign. People are apt to abuse mathematics, when they don't know what\r\nthey're talking about. The science of mathematics is the very basis of\r\nmusic, divine melody, heaven's harmony.”\r\n\r\n“You needn't tell me,” said Pennington, “that a plus b and z minus y\r\nlie at the basis of 'Home, Sweet Home' and the 'Star Spangled Banner.'\r\nI accept a lot of your tales because you come from an old state like\r\nVermont, but there's a limit, George.”\r\n\r\nWarner looked at him pityingly.\r\n\r\n“Frank,” he said, “I'm not arguing with you. I'm telling you. Haven't\r\nyou known me long enough to accept whatever I say as a fact, and to\r\naccept it at once and without question? Not to do so is an insult to me\r\nand to the truth. Now say over slowly with me: 'The basis of music is\r\nmathematics.'”\r\n\r\nThey said slowly together:\r\n\r\n“The basis of music is mathematics.”\r\n\r\n“Now I accept your apologies,” said Warner loftily.\r\n\r\nPennington laughed.\r\n\r\n“You're a queer fellow, George,” he said. “When this war is over and I\r\nreceive my general's uniform I'm coming up into the Vermont mountains\r\nand look your people over. Will it be safe?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, if you learn to read and write by then, and don't come\r\nwearing your buffalo robe. We're strong on education and manners.”\r\n\r\n“Why, George,” said Pennington in the same light tone, “I could\r\nread when I was two years old, and, as for writing, I wrote a lot of\r\ntext-books for the Vermont schools before I came to the war.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up, you two,” said Dick. “Don't you know that this is a war and\r\nnot a talking match?”\r\n\r\n“It's not a war just now, or at least there are a few moments between\r\nbattles,” retorted Warner, “and the best way I can use them is in\r\ninstructing our ignorant young friend from Nebraska.”\r\n\r\nTheir conversation was interrupted by Colonel Winchester, who ordered\r\nthe regiment to move to a new point. General Grant had decided to attack\r\na little town called Port Gibson, which commanded the various approaches\r\nto Grand Gulf. If he could take that he might shut up Bowen and his\r\nforce in Grand Gulf. On the other hand, if he failed he might be shut\r\nin himself by Confederate armies gathering from Jackson, Vicksburg, and\r\nelsewhere. The region, moreover, was complicated for both armies by the\r\nmighty Mississippi and the Big Black River, itself a large stream, and\r\nthere were deep and often unfordable bayous.\r\n\r\nBut Grant showed great qualities, and Dick, who was experienced enough\r\nnow to see and know, admired him more than ever. He pushed forward with\r\nthe utmost resolution and courage. His vanguard, led by McClernand, and\r\nincluding the Winchester regiment, seized solid ground near Port Gibson,\r\nbut found themselves confronted by a formidable Southern force. Bowen,\r\nwho commanded in Grand Gulf, was brave and able. Seeing the Union army\r\nmarching toward his rear, and knowing that if Grant took it he would be\r\nsurrounded, both on land and water, by a force outnumbering his nearly\r\nthree to one, he marched out at once and took station two miles in front\r\nof Port Gibson.\r\n\r\nDick was by the side of Colonel Winchester as he rode forward. The faint\r\necho of shots from the skirmishers far in front showed that they had\r\nroused up an enemy. Glasses were put in use at once.\r\n\r\n“The Confederates are before us,” said Colonel Winchester.\r\n\r\n“So they are, and we're going to have hard fighting,” said a major.\r\n“Look what a position!”\r\n\r\nDick said nothing, but he was using his glasses, too. He saw before him\r\nrough ground, thickly sown with underbrush. There was also a deep ravine\r\nor rather marsh choked with vines, bushes, reeds, and trees that like a\r\nwatery soil. The narrow road divided and went around either end of the\r\nlong work, where the two divisions united again on a ridge, on which\r\nBowen had placed his fine troops and artillery.\r\n\r\n“I don't see their men yet, except a few skirmishers,” said Dick.\r\n\r\n“No, but we'll find them in some good place beyond it,” replied Colonel\r\nWinchester, divining Bowen's plan.\r\n\r\nIt was night when the army in two divisions, one turning to the right\r\nand the other to the left, began the circuit of the great marshy ravine.\r\nDick noticed that the troops who had struggled so long in mud and water\r\nwere eager. Here, west of the Alleghanies, the men in blue were always\r\nexpecting to win.\r\n\r\nThe sky was sown with stars, casting a filmy light over the marching\r\ncolumns. Dick was with the troops passing to the right, and he observed\r\nagain their springy and eager tread.\r\n\r\nNor was the night without a lively note. Skirmishers, eager riflemen\r\nprowling among the bushes, fired often at one another, and now and then\r\na Union cannon sent a shell screaming into some thick clump of forest,\r\nlest a foe be lurking there for ambush.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the rifles and cannon kept every one alert and watchful.\r\nEarly in the night while it was yet clear Dick often saw the flashes\r\nfrom the firing, but, as the morning hours approached, heavy mists began\r\nto rise from that region of damp earth and great waters. He shivered\r\nmore than once, and on the advice of Sergeant Whitley wrapped his\r\ncavalry cloak about him.\r\n\r\n“Chills and fever,” said the sergeant sententiously. “So much water and\r\nmarsh it's hard to escape it. The sooner we fight the better.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that's what General Grant thinks already,” said Dick; “so I\r\nsuppose he doesn't need chills and fever to drive him on. All the same,\r\nSergeant, I'll wrap up as you say.”\r\n\r\nAll the men in the Winchester regiment were soon doing the same. The\r\nmists of the Mississippi, the Big Black and the bayous were raw and\r\ncold, although it would be hot later on. But the period of coldness did\r\nnot last long. Soon the low sun showed in the east and the warm daylight\r\ncame. In the new light they saw the Confederate forces strongly posted\r\non the ridge where the halves of the road rejoined. As the Union column\r\ncame into view a cannon boomed and a shell burst in the road so near\r\nthat dirt was thrown upon them as it exploded and one man was wounded.\r\nAt the same time the column on the left under Osterhaus appeared, having\r\nperformed its semicircle about the marsh, and the whole Union army,\r\nweary of body but eager of soul, pressed forward. The Winchester\r\nregiment and the Ohio regiment beside it charged hotly, but were\r\nreceived with a fire of great volume and accuracy that swept them from\r\nthe road. Another battery on their far left also raked them with a cross\r\nfire, and so terrible was their reception that they were compelled to\r\nabandon some of their own cannon and seek shelter.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment, except the officers, were not mounted in this\r\nmarch, as Grant would not wait for their horses, which were on another\r\ntransport. The very fact saved from death many who would have made a\r\nmore shining target. Dick's own horse was killed at the first fire,\r\nand as he leaped clear to escape he went down to his waist in a marsh,\r\nanother fact which saved his life a second time as the new volleys swept\r\nover his head. The horses of other officers also were killed, and the\r\nremainder, finding themselves such conspicuous targets, sprang to the\r\nground. The frightened animals, tearing the reins from their hands,\r\nraced through the thickets or fell into the marsh.\r\n\r\nAll the time Dick heard the shells and bullets shrieking and whining\r\nover his head. But, regaining his courage and presence of mind, he\r\nslowly pulled himself out of the marsh, taking shelter behind a huge\r\ncypress that grew at its very edge. As he dashed the mud out of his eyes\r\nhe heard a voice saying:\r\n\r\n“Don't push! There's room enough here for the three of us. In fact,\r\nthere's room enough behind the big trees for all the officers.”\r\n\r\nIt was Warner who was speaking with such grim irony, and Pennington by\r\nhis side was hugging the tree. Shells and shot shrieked over their heads\r\nand countless bullets hummed about them. The soldiers also had taken\r\nshelter behind the trees, and Warner's jest about the officers was\r\na jest only. Nevertheless the Southern fire was great in volume and\r\naccuracy. Bowen was an able commander with excellent men, and from\r\nhis position that covered the meeting of the roads he swept both Union\r\ncolumns with a continuous hail of death.\r\n\r\n“We must get out of this somehow,” said Dick. “If we're held here in\r\nthese swamps and thickets any longer the Johnnies can shoot us down at\r\ntheir leisure.”\r\n\r\n“But we won't be held!” exclaimed Pennington. “Look! One of our brigades\r\nis through, and it's charging the enemy on the right!”\r\n\r\nIt was Hovey who had forced his way through a thicket, supposed to be\r\nimpenetrable, and who now, with a full brigade behind him, was rushing\r\nupon Bowen's flank. Then, while the Southern defense was diverted to\r\nthis new attack, the Winchester and the Ohio regiment attacked in front,\r\nshouting with triumph.\r\n\r\nHovey's rush was overpowering. He drove in the Southern flank, taking\r\nfour cannon and hundreds of prisoners, but the dauntless Confederate\r\ncommander, withdrawing his men in perfect order, retreated to a second\r\nridge, where he took up a stronger position than the first.\r\n\r\nResolute and dangerous, the men in gray turned their faces anew to the\r\nenemy and sent back a withering fire that burned away the front ranks\r\nof the Union army. Osterhaus, in spite of every effort, was driven back,\r\nand the Winchesters and their Ohio friends were compelled to give ground\r\ntoo. It seemed that the utmost of human effort and defiance of death\r\ncould not force the narrow passage.\r\n\r\nBut a new man, a host in himself, came upon the field. Grant, who had\r\nbeen on foot for two days, endeavoring to get his army through the\r\nthickets and morasses, heard the booming of the cannon and he knew that\r\nthe vanguards had clashed. He borrowed a cavalry horse and, galloping\r\ntoward the sound of the guns, reached the field at mid-morning. Grant\r\nwas not impressive in either figure or manner, but the soldiers had\r\nlearned to believe in him as they always believe in one who leads them\r\nto victory.\r\n\r\nA tremendous shout greeted his coming and the men, snatching off their\r\nhats and caps, waved them aloft. Grant took no notice but rapidly\r\ndisposed his troops for a new and heavier battle. Dick felt the strong\r\nand sure hand over them. The Union fire grew in might and rapidity.\r\nMcPherson arrived with two brigades to help Osterhaus, and the\r\nstrengthened division was able to send a brigade across a ravine, where\r\nit passed further around Bowen's flank and assailed him with fury.\r\n\r\nDick felt that their own division under McClernand was also making\r\nprogress. Although many men were falling they pressed slowly forward,\r\nand Grant brought up help for them too. For a long time the struggle was\r\ncarried on. It was one of the little battles of the war, but its results\r\nwere important and few were fought with more courage and resolution.\r\nBowen, with only eight thousand against twenty thousand, held fast\r\nthroughout all the long hot hours of the afternoon. Grant, owing to the\r\nnature of the field, was unable to get all his numbers into battle at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nBut when the twilight began to show Dick believed that victory was at\r\nhand. They had not yet driven Bowen out, but they were pressing him\r\nso close and hard, and Grant was securing so many new positions of\r\nadvantage, that the Southern leader could not make another such fight\r\nagainst superior numbers in the morning.\r\n\r\nTwilight turned into night and Bowen and his men, who had shown so much\r\nheroism, retreated in the dark, leaving six guns and many prisoners as\r\ntrophies of the victors.\r\n\r\nIt was night when the battle ceased. Cannon and rifles flashed at fitful\r\nintervals, warning skirmishers to keep away, but after a while they\r\ntoo ceased and the Union army, exhausted by the long march of the night\r\nbefore and the battle of the day, threw itself panting upon the ground.\r\nThe officers posted the sentinels in triple force, but let the remainder\r\nof the men rest.\r\n\r\nAs Dick lay down in the long grass two or three bullets dropped from\r\nhis clothes and he became conscious, too, that a bullet had grazed his\r\nshoulder. But these trifles did not disturb him. It was so sweet to\r\nrest! Nothing could be more heavenly than merely to lie there in the\r\nlong, soft grass and gaze up at the luminous sky, into which the stars\r\nnow stole to twinkle down at him peacefully.\r\n\r\n“Don't go to sleep, Dick,” said a voice near him. “I admit the\r\ntemptation is strong. I feel it myself, but General Grant may have to\r\nsend you and me forward to-night to win another battle.”\r\n\r\n“George, I'm glad to hear your preachy voice over there. Hurt any?”\r\n\r\n“No. A million cannon balls brushed my right cheek and another million\r\nbrushed my left cheek, but they didn't touch me. They scared me to\r\ndeath, but in the last few minutes I've begun to come back to life. In a\r\nquarter of an hour I'll be just as much alive as I ever was.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know anything of Pennington?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The rascal is lying about six feet beyond me, sound asleep. In\r\nspite of all I could do he wouldn't stay awake. I've punched him all\r\nover to see if he was wounded, but as he didn't groan at a single punch,\r\nhe's all right.”\r\n\r\n“That being the case, I'm going to follow Pennington's example. You may\r\nlecture me as much as you please, George, but you'll lecture only the\r\nnight, because I'll be far away from here in a land of sweet dreams.”\r\n\r\n“All right, if you're going to do it, I will too. You'll hear my snore\r\nbefore I hear yours.”\r\n\r\nBoth sank in a few minutes into a deep slumber, and when they awoke the\r\nnext morning they found that Bowen had abandoned Port Gibson and had\r\nretreated into Grand Gulf again. There was great elation among the lads\r\nand Dick began to feel that the position of the Union army in the far\r\nSouth was strengthened immeasurably. He heard that Sherman, who had\r\nstood so staunchly at Shiloh, was on his way to join Grant. Their united\r\nforces would press the siege of Grand Gulf and would also turn to strike\r\nat any foe who might approach from the rear.\r\n\r\nNever since the war began had Dick felt so elated as he did that\r\nmorning. When he saw the short, thick-set figure of Grant riding by\r\nhe believed that the Union, in the West at least, had found its man at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. DICK'S MISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night came down warm and heavy. Spring was far advanced in that\r\nSouthern region, and foliage and grass were already rich and heavy.\r\nDick, from his dozing position beside a camp fire, saw a great mass of\r\ntall grass and green bushes beyond which lay the deep waters of a still\r\ncreek or bayou. The air, although thick and close, conduced to rest and\r\nthe peace that reigned after the battle was soothing to his soul.\r\n\r\nHis friends, the two lads, who were knitted to him by so many hardships\r\nand dangers shared, were sound asleep, and he could see their tanned\r\nfaces when the light of the flickering fires fell upon them. Good\r\nold Warner! Good old Pennington! The comradeship of war knitted youth\r\ntogether with ties that never could be broken.\r\n\r\nHe moved into an easier position. He lay upon the soft turf and he had\r\ndoubled his blanket under his head as a pillow. At first the droning\r\nnoises of camp or preparation had come from afar, but soon they ceased\r\nand now the frogs down by the sluggish waters began to croak.\r\n\r\nIt was a musical sound, one that he had heard often in his native state,\r\nand, singularly enough, the lad drew encouragement from it. “Be of good\r\ncheer! Be of good cheer! Trust in the future! Trust in the future!” said\r\nall those voices down among the swamps and reeds. And then Dick said\r\nto himself: “I will trust and I will have hope!” He remembered his last\r\nglimpse of Grant's short, strong figure and the confidence that this man\r\ninspired in him. He, with tens of thousands of others, Abraham Lincoln\r\nat their head, had been looking for a man, they had looked long and in\r\nvain for such a man, but Dick was beginning to believe that they had\r\nfound him at last.\r\n\r\nIt would take much of a man to stand before the genius of Lee, but it\r\nmight be Grant. Dick's faith in the star of his country, shattered so\r\noften for the moment, began to rise that night and never sank again.\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep to the homely music of the frogs among the reeds, and\r\nslept without stir until nearly dawn.\r\n\r\nJust as the first strip of gray showed in the east Colonel Winchester\r\nwalked toward the spot where Dick and his comrades lay. The colonel had\r\nnot slept that night. His fine face was worn and thin, but the blue eyes\r\nwere alight with strength and energy. He had just left a conference of\r\nhigh officers, and he came upon a mission. He reached the three lads,\r\nand looked down at them with a sort of pity. He knew that it was his\r\nduty to awake them at once and send them upon a perilous errand, but\r\nthey were so young, and they had already been through so much that he\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\nHe put his hand upon Dick's shoulder and shook him. But it took more\r\nthan one shake to awaken the lad, and it was fully a minute before he\r\nopened his eyes and sat up. Dick conscious but partly and rubbing his\r\nsleepy eyes, asked:\r\n\r\n“What is it? Are we to go into battle again? Yes, sir! Yes, sir! I'm\r\nready!”\r\n\r\n“Not that, Dick, but I've orders for you.”\r\n\r\nDick now awoke completely and saw that it was Colonel Winchester. He\r\nsprang to his feet and saluted.\r\n\r\n“We'll wake up Warner and Pennington next,” said the colonel, “because\r\nthey go also on the kind of duty to which you're assigned.”\r\n\r\n“I'm glad of that,” said Dick warmly.\r\n\r\nWarner and Pennington were aroused with difficulty, but, as soon as\r\nthey realized that Colonel Winchester was before them and that they were\r\nselected for a grave duty, they became at once keen and alert.\r\n\r\n“Lads,” said the colonel briefly, “you've all felt that we're now led by\r\na great commander. But energy and daring on the part of a leader demand\r\nenergy and daring on the part of his men. General Grant is about to\r\nundertake a great enterprise, one that demands the concentration of his\r\ntroops. I want you, Warner, to go to General Sherman with this dispatch,\r\nand here is one for you, Pennington, to take to General Banks.”\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment and Dick asked:\r\n\r\n“Am I to be left out?”\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester smiled.\r\n\r\nHe liked this eagerness on the part of his boys, and yet there was\r\nsadness in his smile, too. Young lieutenants who rode forth on errands\r\noften failed to come back.\r\n\r\n“You're included, Dick,” he said, “and I think that yours is the most\r\nperilous mission of them all. Pennington, you and Warner can be making\r\nready and I'll tell Dick what he's to do.”\r\n\r\nThe Vermonter and the Nebraskan hurried away and Colonel Winchester,\r\ntaking Dick by the arm, walked with him beyond the circle of firelight.\r\n\r\n“Dick,” he said gently, “they asked me to choose the one in my command\r\nwhom I thought most fit for this duty to be done, and I've selected you,\r\nalthough I'm sending you into a great peril.”\r\n\r\nDick flushed with pride at the trust. Youth blinded him at present to\r\nits perils.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” he said simply.\r\n\r\n“You will recall Major Hertford, who was with us in Kentucky before the\r\nShiloh days?”\r\n\r\n“I could not forget him, sir. One of our most gallant officers.”\r\n\r\n“You speak truly. He is one of our bravest, and also one of our ablest.\r\nI speak of him as Major Hertford, but he has lately been promoted to the\r\nrank of colonel, and he is operating toward the East with a large body\r\nof cavalry, partly in conjunction with Grierson, who saved us at the\r\nford.”\r\n\r\n“And you want me to reach him, sir!”\r\n\r\n“You've divined it. He is near Jackson, the capital of this state, and,\r\nincidentally, you're to discover as much as you can about Jackson and\r\nthe Confederate dispositions in that direction. We wish Hertford to join\r\nGeneral Grant's advance, which will presently move toward Jackson, and\r\nwe rely upon you to find him.”\r\n\r\n“I'll do it, if he's to be found at all,” said Dick fervently.\r\n\r\n“I knew it, but, Dick, you're to go in your uniform. I'll not have you\r\nexecuted as a spy in case you're taken. Nor are you to carry any written\r\nmessage to Colonel Hertford. He knows you well, and he'll accept your\r\nword at once as truth. Now, this is a ride that will call for woodcraft\r\nas well as soldiership.”\r\n\r\n“I start at once, do I not, sir?”\r\n\r\n“You do. Warner and Pennington are ready now, and your own horse is\r\nwaiting for you. Here is a small map which I have reason to believe is\r\naccurate, at least fairly so, although few of our men know much of this\r\ncountry. But use it, lad, as best you can.”\r\n\r\nIt was a sheet of thick fibrous paper about six inches square and, after\r\na hasty glance at it, Dick folded it up carefully and put it in his\r\npocket. Warner and Pennington appeared then, mounted and armed and ready\r\nto tell him good-bye. He and Colonel Winchester watched them a moment\r\nor two as they rode away, and then an orderly appeared with Dick's\r\nown horse, a fine bay, saddled, bridled, saddlebags filled with food,\r\npistols in holsters, and a breech-loading rifle strapped to the saddle.\r\n\r\n“I've made your equipment the best I could,” said Colonel Winchester,\r\n“and after you start, lad, you must use your own judgment.”\r\n\r\nHe wrung the hand of the boy, for whom his affection was genuine and\r\ndeep, and Dick sprang into the saddle.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, colonel,” he said, “I thank you for this trust, and I won't\r\nfail.”\r\n\r\nIt was not a boast. It was courage speaking from the heart of youth and,\r\nas Dick rode out of the camp on his good horse, he considered himself\r\nequal to any task. He felt an enormous pride because he was chosen for\r\nsuch an important and perilous mission, and he summoned every faculty to\r\nmeet its hardships and dangers.\r\n\r\nHe had the password, and the sentinels wished him good luck. So did the\r\nmen who were gathering firewood. One, a small, weazened fellow, gave him\r\nan envious look.\r\n\r\n“Wish I was going riding with you,” he said. “It's fine in the woods\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nDick laughed through sheer exuberance of spirits.\r\n\r\n“Maybe it is and maybe it isn't,” he said. “Perhaps the forest is filled\r\nwith rebel sharpshooters.”\r\n\r\n“If you ride toward Jackson you're likely to strike Confederate bands.”\r\n\r\n“I didn't say where I'm going, but you may be certain I'll keep a watch\r\nfor those bands wherever I may be.”\r\n\r\nThe little man was uncommonly strong nevertheless, as he carried on his\r\nshoulder a heavy log which he threw down by one of the fires, but Dick,\r\nabsorbed in his journey, forgot the desire of the soldier to be riding\r\nthrough the forest too.\r\n\r\nHe soon left the camp behind. He looked back at it only once, and beheld\r\nthe luminous glow of the campfires. Then the forest shut it out and he\r\nrode on through a region almost abandoned by its people owing to the\r\nconverging armies. He did not yet look at his map, because he knew that\r\nhe would soon come into the main road to Jackson. It would be sufficient\r\nto determine his course then.\r\n\r\nDick was not familiar with the farther South, which was a very different\r\nregion from his own Kentucky. His home was a region of firm land, hills\r\nand clear streams, but here the ground lay low, the soil was soft and\r\nthe waters dark and sluggish. But his instincts as a woodsman were\r\nfortified by much youthful training, and he felt that he could find the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIt gave him now great joy to leave the army and ride away through the\r\ndeep woods. He was tired of battle and the sight of wounds and death.\r\nThe noises of the camp were painful to his ear, and in the forest he\r\nfound peace.\r\n\r\nHe was absolutely alone in his world, and glad of it. The woods were in\r\nall the depth and richness of a Southern spring. Vast masses of green\r\nfoliage billowed away to right and left. Great festoons of moss hung\r\nfrom the oaks, and trailing vines wrapped many of the trees almost to\r\ntheir tops. Wild flowers, pink, yellow and blue, unknown by name to\r\nDick, bloomed in the open spaces.\r\n\r\nThe air of early morning was crisp with the breath of life. He had come\r\nupon a low ridge of hard ground, away from the vast current and low,\r\nsodden shores of the Mississippi. Here was a clean atmosphere, and the\r\nforest, the forest everywhere. A mockingbird, perched on a bough almost\r\nover his head, began to pour forth his liquid song, and from another far\r\naway came the same song like an echo. Dick looked up but he could not\r\nsee the bird among the branches. Nevertheless he waved his hand toward\r\nthe place from which the melody came and gave a little trill in reply.\r\nThen he said aloud:\r\n\r\n“It's a happy omen that you give me. I march away to the sound of\r\ninnocent music.”\r\n\r\nThen he increased his speed a little and rode without stopping until he\r\ncame to the main road to Jackson. There he examined his map upon which\r\nwere marked many rivers, creeks, lagoons and bayous, with extensive\r\nshaded areas meaning forests. In the southeastern corner of the map was\r\nJackson, close to which he meant to go.\r\n\r\nHe rode on at a fair pace, keeping an extremely careful watch ahead and\r\non either side of the road. He meant to turn aside soon into the woods,\r\nbut for the present he thought himself safe in the road--it was not\r\nlikely that Southern raiders would come so near to the Union camp.\r\n\r\nHis feeling of peace deepened. He was so far away now that no warlike\r\nsound could reach him. Instead the song of the mockingbird pursued\r\nhim. Dick, full of youth and life, began to whistle the tune with the\r\nsongster, and his horse perhaps soothed too by the rhythm broke into the\r\ngentle pace which is so easy for the rider.\r\n\r\nIt was early dawn, and the west was not yet wholly light. The east was\r\nfull of gold, but the silver lingered on the opposite horizon, and\r\nthe hot sun of Mississippi did not yet shed its rays over the earth.\r\nInstead, a cool breeze blew on Dick's face, and the quick blood was\r\nstill leaping in his veins. The road dipped down and he came to a brook,\r\nwhich was clear despite its proximity to the mighty yellow trench of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nHe let his horse drink freely, and, while he drank, he surveyed the\r\ncountry as well as he could. On his left he saw through a fringe of\r\nwoods a field of young corn and showing dimly beyond it a small house.\r\nUnbroken forest stretched away on his right, but in field as well as\r\nforest there was no sign of a human being.\r\n\r\nHe studied his map again, noting the great number of water courses,\r\nwhich in the spring season were likely to be at the flood, and, for\r\nthe first time, he realized the extreme difficulty of his mission.\r\nMississippi was in the very heart of the Confederacy. He could not\r\nexpect any sympathetic farmers to help him or show him the way. More\r\nlikely as he advanced toward Jackson he would find the country swarming\r\nwith the friends of the Confederacy, and to pass through them would\r\ndemand the last resource of skill and courage. Perhaps it would have\r\nbeen wiser had he put on citizens clothes and taken his chances as a\r\nspy! He did not know that Colonel Winchester would have ordered the\r\ndisguise had the one who rode on this most perilous mission been any\r\nother than he.\r\n\r\nThe realization brought with it extreme caution. Growing up in a country\r\nwhich was still mainly in forest, not differing much from its primitive\r\ncondition, save for the absence of Indians and big game, he had learned\r\nto be at home in the woods, and now he turned from the path, riding\r\namong the trees.\r\n\r\nHe kept a course some distance from the road, where he was sheltered\r\nby the deep foliage and could yet see what was passing along the main\r\nartery of travel. The ground at times was spongy, making traveling hard,\r\nand twice his horse swam deep creeks. He would have turned into the road\r\nat these points but the bridges were broken down and he had no other\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nThe morning waned, and the coolness departed. The sun hung overhead,\r\nblazing hot, and the air in the forest grew dense and heavy. He would\r\nhave been glad to turn back into the road, in the hope of finding a\r\nbreeze in the open space, but caution still kept him in the forest.\r\nHe soon saw two men in brown jeans riding mules, farmers perhaps, but\r\ncarrying rifles on their shoulders, and, drawing his horse behind a big\r\ntree, he waited until they passed.\r\n\r\nThey rode on unseeing and he resumed his journey, to stop an hour later\r\nand eat cold food, while he permitted his horse to graze in an opening.\r\nHe had seen only three houses, one a large colonial mansion, with the\r\nsmoke rising from several chimneys, and the others small log structures\r\ninhabited by poor farmers, but nobody was at work in the fields.\r\n\r\nWhen he resumed the journey he was thankful that he had kept to the\r\nwoods as a body of Confederate cavalry, coming out of a path from the\r\nnorth, turned into the main road and advanced at a good pace toward\r\nJackson. They seemed to be in good spirits, as he could hear them\r\ntalking and laughing, but he was glad when they were out of sight as\r\nthese Southerners had keen eyes and a pair of them might have discerned\r\nhim in the brush.\r\n\r\nHe went deeper into the woods and made another long study of his map. It\r\nseemed to him now that he knew every hill and lagoon and road and path,\r\nand he resolved to ride a straight course through the forest. There\r\nwas a point, distinctly marked north of Jackson, where he was to find\r\nHertford if he arrived in time, or to wait for him if he got there ahead\r\nof time, and he believed that with the aid of the map he could reach it\r\nthrough the woods.\r\n\r\nHe rode now by the sun and he saw neither path nor fields. He was in the\r\ndeep wilderness once more. The mockingbirds sang around him again and\r\nthrough the rifts in the leaves he saw the sailing hawks seeking their\r\nprey. Three huge owls sitting in a row on a bough slept undisturbed\r\nwhile he passed. He took it as an omen that the wilderness was deserted,\r\nand his confidence was strong.\r\n\r\nBut the firm ground ceased and he rode through a region of swamps. The\r\nhoofs of his horse splashed through mud and water. Now and then a snake\r\ndrew away its slimy length and Dick shuddered. He could not help it.\r\nSnakes, even the harmless, always gave him shivers.\r\n\r\nThe wilderness now had an evil beauty. The vegetation was almost\r\ntropical in its luxuriance, but Dick liked better the tender green of\r\nhis more northern state. Great beds of sunflowers nodded in the light\r\nbreeze. Vast masses of vines and creepers pulled down the trees, and\r\non many of the vines deep red roses were blooming. Then came areas\r\nof solemn live oaks and gloomy cypresses, where no mockingbirds were\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\nHe rode for half a mile along a deep lagoon or bayou, he did not know\r\nwhich, and saw hawks swoop down and draw fish from its dark surface.\r\nThe whole scene was ugly and cruel, and he was glad when he left it and\r\nentered the woods again. Once he thought he heard the mellow voice of a\r\nnegro singing, but that was the only sound, save the flitting of small\r\nwild animals through the undergrowth.\r\n\r\nHe came, mid-afternoon, to a river, which he made his horse swim boldly\r\nand then entered forest that seemed more dense than ever. But the ground\r\nhere was firmer and he was glad of a chance to rest both himself and his\r\nmount. He dismounted, tethered the horse and stretched his own limbs,\r\nweary from riding.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty little glade, surrounded by high forest, fitted for rest\r\nand peace, but his horse reared suddenly and tried to break loose. There\r\nwas a heavy crashing in the undergrowth and a deer, wild with alarm,\r\ndarting within a dozen feet of Dick, disappeared in the forest, running\r\nmadly.\r\n\r\nHe knew there were many deer in the Mississippi woods, but he was\r\nobservant and the flight aroused his attention. His first thought that\r\nhe and his horse had scared the deer could not be true, because it had\r\ncome from a point directly behind and had rushed past them. Then its\r\nalarm must have been caused by some other human being near by in the\r\nforest or by a panther. His theory inclined to the human being.\r\n\r\nDick was troubled. The more he thought of the incident the less he liked\r\nit. He made no effort to hide from himself the dangers that surrounded\r\nhim in the land of the enemy, and remounting he rode briskly forward. As\r\nthe ground was firm and the forest was free enough from undergrowth to\r\npermit of speed he finally broke into a gallop which he maintained for a\r\nhalf-hour.\r\n\r\nHe struck marsh again and was a long time in passing through it. But\r\nwhen he was a half-mile on the other side he drew into a dense cluster\r\nof bushes and waited. He could not get the flight of the deer out of\r\nhis mind, and knowing that it was well in the wilderness to obey\r\npremonitions he watched more closely.\r\n\r\nDick sat on his horse behind the bush a full five minutes, and presently\r\nhe became conscious that his heart was pounding heavily. He exerted his\r\nwill and called himself foolish, but in vain. The flight of the deer\r\npersisted in his mind. It was a warning that somebody else was in the\r\nwoods not far behind him, and, while he waited, he saw a shadow among\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nIt was only a shadow, but it was like the figure of a man. A single\r\nglimpse and he was gone. The stranger, whoever he was, had darted back\r\nin the undergrowth. Dick waited another five minutes, but the shadow did\r\nnot reappear. He felt a measure of relief because all doubts were gone\r\nnow. He was sure that he was followed, but by whom?\r\n\r\nHe knew that his danger had increased manifold. Some Southern scout or\r\nskirmisher had discovered his presence and, in such a quest, the trailer\r\nhad the advantage of the trailed. Yet he did not hesitate. He knew his\r\ngeneral direction and, shifting the pistols from the saddle-holsters to\r\nhis belt he again urged his horse forward.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to good ground he walked, leading his mount, as the\r\nanimal was much exhausted by the effort the marshes needed. But whenever\r\nthe undergrowth grew dense he stopped to look and listen. He did not see\r\nthe shadow and he heard nothing save the ordinary sounds of the woods,\r\nbut either instinct or imagination told him that the stranger still\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nThe sun was far down the westward slope, but it was still very hot\r\nin the woods. There was no breeze. Not a leaf, nor a blade of grass\r\nstirred. Dick heard his heart still pounding. The unseen pursuit--he had\r\nno doubt it was there--was becoming a terrible strain upon his nerves.\r\nThe perspiration ran down his face, and he sought with angry eyes for a\r\nsight of the fellow who presumed to hang upon his tracks.\r\n\r\nHe began to wonder what he would do when the night came. There would be\r\nno rest, no sleep for him, even in the darkness. Twice he curved from\r\nhis course and hid in the undergrowth to see his pursuer come up, but\r\nthere was nothing. Then he reasoned with himself. He had not really seen\r\nthe flitting figure of a man. It was merely the effect of an alarmed\r\nimagination, and he told himself to ride straight on, looking ahead, not\r\nback. But reason again yielded to instinct and he curved once more into\r\nthe deep forest, where the tangle of vines and undergrowth also was so\r\nthick that it would take a keen eye to find him.\r\n\r\nDick looked back along the path which he had come and he was confident\r\nthat he saw some of the tall bushes shake a little. It could not be\r\nwind, because the air was absolutely still, and soon he was convinced\r\nthat his instinct had been right all the time. Fancy had played him no\r\ntrick and the shadow that he had seen was a human figure.\r\n\r\nHe felt with all the force of conviction that he was in great danger,\r\nbut he did not know what to do. So he did nothing, but sat quietly on\r\nhis horse among the bushes. The heat was intense there and innumerable\r\nflies, gnats, and mosquitoes assailed him. The mosquitoes were so fierce\r\nthat they drew blood from his face a half-dozen times.\r\n\r\nAlone in the heat of the deep marshy wilderness he felt fear more than\r\nin battle. Danger threatened here in a mysterious, invisible fashion and\r\nhe could only wait.\r\n\r\nHe saw a bush move again, but much nearer, and then came the crack of\r\na rifle. If his horse, alarmed perhaps, had not thrown up his head\r\nsuddenly, and received the bullet himself the lad's career would have\r\nended there.\r\n\r\nThe horse made a convulsive leap, then staggered for a few seconds,\r\ngiving his rider time to spring clear, and fell among the bushes.\r\nDick dropped down behind him and quickly unstrapped the rifle from the\r\nsaddle, meaning to use the animal's body as a breastwork against renewed\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nHis fear, the kind of fear that the bravest feel, had been driven away\r\nby rage. The killing of his innocent horse, although the bullet was\r\nintended for him, angered him as much as if he had received a wound\r\nhimself. The spirit of his ancestor, the shrewd and wary Indian fighter,\r\ndescended upon him again, and, lying upon his stomach behind the horse,\r\nwith the rifle ready he was anxious for the attack to come.\r\n\r\nDick was firmly convinced that he had but a single enemy. Otherwise he\r\nwould have been attacked in force earlier, and more than one shot would\r\nhave been fired. But the report of the rifle was succeeded by deep\r\nsilence. The forest was absolutely still, not a breath of wind stirring.\r\nHis enemy remained invisible, but the besieged youth was confident that\r\nhe was lying quiet, awaiting another chance. Dick, still hot with anger,\r\nwould wait too.\r\n\r\nBut other enemies were far more reckless than the hidden marksman. The\r\nswarm of gnats, flies, and mosquitoes assailed him again and he could\r\nhave cried out in pain. His only consolation lay in the fact that the\r\nother man might be suffering just as much.\r\n\r\nHe was aware that his enemy might try a circling movement in order to\r\nreach him on the flank or from behind, but he believed that his ear\r\nwould be keen enough to detect him if he came near. Moreover he lay in\r\na slight dip with the body of the horse in front of him, and it would\r\nrequire an uncommon sharpshooter to reach him with a bullet. If he could\r\nonly stand those terrible mosquitoes an hour he felt that he might get\r\naway, because then the night would be at hand.\r\n\r\nHe saw with immense relief that the sun was already very low. The\r\nheat, gathered in the woods, was at its worst, and over his head the\r\nmosquitoes buzzed and buzzed incessantly. It seemed to him a horrible\r\nsort of irony that he might presently be forced from his shelter by\r\nmosquitoes and be killed in flight to another refuge.\r\n\r\nBut he was endowed with great patience and tenacity and he clung to his\r\nshelter, relying rather upon ear than eye to note the approach of an\r\nenemy. Meanwhile the sun sank down to the rim of the wood, and the\r\ntwilight thickened rapidly in the east. Then a shot was fired from the\r\npoint from which the first had come. Dick heard the bullet singing over\r\nhis head, but it gave him satisfaction because he was able to locate his\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nHe sought no return fire, but lay in the dip, wary and patient. The sun\r\nsank beyond the rim, the western sky flamed blood red for a few moments,\r\nand then the Southern night swept down so suddenly that it seemed to\r\ncome with violence. Dick believed that his escape was now at hand, but\r\nhe still showed an infinite patience.\r\n\r\nHe did not stir from his place until the night was almost black, and\r\nthen, carrying his weapons and the saddlebag of provisions, he crept\r\namong the thickets.\r\n\r\nWhen he stood up he found himself stiff from lying long in a cramped\r\nposition. His face burned from the bites of the mosquitoes, which still\r\nhung in swarms about him, and he felt dizzy.\r\n\r\nBut Dick remembered his mission, and his resolve to perform it was not\r\nshaken a particle. He had lost his horse, but he could walk. Perhaps his\r\nchance of success would be greater on foot in such a dangerous country.\r\n\r\nHe advanced now with extreme caution, feeling the way carefully and\r\ntesting the ground before he put his foot down solidly. Still trusting\r\nto his ears he stopped now and then, and listened for some sound from\r\nhis enemy in pursuit. But nothing came, and soon he became quite sure\r\nthat he had shaken him off. He was merely a dot in the wilderness in the\r\ndark, and, feeling secure now, he pressed forward with more speed.\r\n\r\nHe was hoping to get to a piece of firm, high ground, where he might\r\nsecure a measure of protection from those terrible mosquitoes which\r\nstill buzzed angrily about his head. In an hour chance favored him, as\r\nhe reached a low ridge much rockier than usual in that region. He would\r\nhave built a little smudge fire to protect himself from the mosquitoes,\r\nbut it would be sure to draw the lurking sharpshooter, and instead he\r\nfound a nook in the ridge, under the low boughs of a great oak. Then\r\nhe took a light blanket which he carried tied to his saddlebags, and\r\nwrapped it around his neck and face, covering everything but his mouth\r\nand eyes.\r\n\r\nHe sank into the nook with his back against the turf, and the reclining\r\nposition was wonderfully easy. The mosquitoes, apparently finding the\r\npoints of exposure too small, left him alone and went away. His face\r\nstill burned from numerous stings, but he forgot it in present comfort.\r\nThere was food in the saddlebags, and he ate enough for his needs. Then\r\nhe laid the saddlebags beside him and the rifle across his knees and\r\nstared out into the darkness.\r\n\r\nHe felt a great relief after his extreme danger and long exertions.\r\nIt was both physical and mental, and sitting there alone in a sunken\r\nwilderness he was nevertheless happy. Believing that the mosquitoes\r\nwould not come back, he wrapped the blanket about his whole body by and\r\nby, and pulled his cap down over his eyes.\r\n\r\nDick had no plans for the night. He did not know whether he intended to\r\nremain there long or not, but nature settled doubts for him. His head\r\ndrooped, and soon he slept as easily and peacefully as if he had been at\r\nhome at Pendleton in his own bed.\r\n\r\nThen the wilderness blotted him out for the time. The little wild\r\nanimals scurried through the grass or ran up trees. In the far distance\r\nan owl hooted solemnly at nothing, and he slept the mighty sleep of\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. HUNTED\r\n\r\n\r\nDick slept the whole night through, which was a very good thing for him,\r\nbecause he needed it, and because he could have made no progress in the\r\nthick darkness through the marshy wilderness. No human beings saw him,\r\nbut the wild animals took more than one look. Not all were little. One\r\nbig clumsy brute, wagging his head in a curious, comic way, shuffled up\r\nfrom the edge of the swamp, sniffed the strange human odor, and, still\r\nwagging his comic head, came rather close to the sleeping boy. Then the\r\nblack bear decided to be afraid, and lumbered back into the bushes.\r\n\r\nAn owl perched on a bough almost over Dick's head, but this was game far\r\ntoo large for Mr. Owl's beak and talons, and he soon flew away in search\r\nof something nearer his size. A raccoon on a bough stared with glowing\r\neyes and then slid out of sight.\r\n\r\nMan, although he had just come, became king of this swamp, king for the\r\nnight. The prowling beasts and birds of prey, after their first look,\r\ngave Dick all the berth he needed, and he did not awake until a bright\r\nsun was well above the edge of the earth. Then he rose, shook himself,\r\nmuch like an animal coming from its lair, and bathed his face in a\r\nlittle stream which ran down the hill into the swamp. It was swollen and\r\npainful from the mosquito bites, but he resolved not to think of them,\r\nand ate breakfast from the saddlebags, after which he studied his map a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nBaggage and rifle on shoulder, he pursued a course south by east. There\r\nwas a strong breeze which gave him a rest from the dreaded insects, and\r\nhe pushed on with vigorous footsteps. The country remained thoroughly\r\nwild, and he soon had proof of it. Another deer, this time obviously\r\nstarted up by himself, sprang from the canebrake and darted away in the\r\nwoods. He noted tracks of bear and resolved some day when the war was\r\nover to come there hunting.\r\n\r\nHis course led him again from firm ground into a region of marshes and\r\nlagoons, which he crossed with difficulty, arriving about an hour before\r\nnoon at a considerable river, one that would require swimming unless he\r\nfound a ford somewhere near. He was very weary from the journey through\r\nthe marsh and, sitting on a log, he scraped from his clothes a portion\r\nof the mud they had accumulated on the way.\r\n\r\nHe was a good swimmer, but he had his arms and ammunition to keep dry,\r\nand he did not wish to trust himself afloat on the deep current. Wading\r\nwould be far better, and, when his strength was restored, he walked up\r\nthe bank in search of a shallower place.\r\n\r\nHe came soon to a point, where the cliff was rather high, although it\r\nwas clothed in dense forest here as elsewhere, and when he reached the\r\ncrest he heard a sound like the swishing of waters. Alert and suspicious\r\nhe sank down among the trees and peered over the bank. Two men in a\r\ncanoe were paddling in a leisurely manner along the stream.\r\n\r\nThe men were in faded and worn Confederate uniforms, and Dick saw\r\ntheir rifles lying in the bottom of the boat. He also saw that they\r\nhad strong, resolute faces. They were almost opposite him and they were\r\nclosely scanning the forest on his side of the river. He was glad that\r\nhe had not tried to swim the stream, and he was glad too that he had\r\nkept so well under cover. The men in the canoe were surely keen of eye,\r\nand they must be a patrol.\r\n\r\nHe sank closer to the earth and did not stir. One of the watchers drew\r\nin his paddle and took up his rifle, while the other propelled the canoe\r\nvery slowly. It seemed that they expected something or somebody, and it\r\nsuddenly occurred to him that it might be he. He felt a little shiver of\r\napprehension. How could they know he was coming? It was mysterious and\r\nalarming.\r\n\r\nHe waited for them to pass down the river and out of sight, but at the\r\ncurve they turned and came back against the stream, the man with the\r\nrifle in his hand still keenly watching the western shore, where Dick\r\nlay hidden. Neither of them spoke, and the only sound was the swishing\r\nof the paddle. The hoot of an owl came from the depths of the forest\r\nbehind him and he knew that it was a signal. The hair of his head\r\nlifted.\r\n\r\nHe felt the touch of the supernatural. The invisible pursuer was behind\r\nhim again, and the silent soldiers held the crossing. The hoot of the\r\nowl came again, a little nearer now. He was tempted to rise and run, but\r\nhis will held him back from such folly. His unknown enemy could pursue,\r\nbecause his boots left a deep trail in the soft earth. That was why he\r\nhad been able to follow again in the morning.\r\n\r\nHe crept back some distance from the river and then, rising, retreated\r\ncautiously up the stream. He caught glimpses of the water twice through\r\nthe bushes, and each time the canoe was moving up the river also, one\r\nman paddling and the other, rifle on his arm, watching the western\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nDick had a feeling that he was trapped. Colonel Winchester had been wise\r\nto make him wear his uniform, because it was now certain that he\r\nwas going to be taken, and death had always been the punishment of\r\na captured spy. He put down the thought resolutely, and began to run\r\nthrough the forest parallel with the river. If it were only the firm\r\nhard ground of the North he could hide his trail from the man behind\r\nhim, but here the soil was so soft that every footstep left a deep mark.\r\nYet he might find fallen trees thrown down by hurricanes, and in a few\r\nminutes he came to a mass of them. He ran deftly from trunk to trunk,\r\nand then continued his flight among the bushes. It broke his trail less\r\nthan a rod, but it might take his pursuer ten minutes to recover it, and\r\nnow ten minutes were precious.\r\n\r\nThe soil grew harder and he made better speed, but when he looked\r\nthrough the foliage he saw the canoe still opposite him. It was easy for\r\nthem, on the smooth surface of the river, to keep pace with him, if such\r\nwas their object. Furious anger took hold of him. He knew that he must\r\nsoon become exhausted, while the men in the canoe would scarcely feel\r\nweariness. Then came the idea.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was light and thin almost like the birch bark Indian canoe of\r\nthe north, and he was a good marksman. It was a last chance, but raising\r\nhis rifle he fired the heavy bullet directly at the bottom of the canoe.\r\nAs the echo of the first shot was dying he slipped in a cartridge and\r\nsent a second at the same target. He did not seek to kill the men, his\r\nobject was the canoe, and as he ran rapidly away he saw it fill with\r\nwater and sink, the two soldiers in the stream swimming toward the\r\nwestern shore.\r\n\r\nDick laughed to himself. He had won a triumph, although he did not yet\r\nknow that it would amount to anything. At any rate the men could no\r\nlonger glide up and down the river at their leisure looking for him to\r\ncome forth from the forest.\r\n\r\nHe knew that the shots would bring the single pursuer at full speed,\r\nand, as he had saved some ounces of strength, he now ran at his utmost\r\nspeed. The river curved again and just beyond the curve it seemed\r\nshallow to him. He plunged in at once, and waded rapidly, holding his\r\nrifle, pistols and saddlebags above his head. He was in dread lest he\r\nreceive a bullet in his back, but he made the farther shore, ran into\r\nthe dense undergrowth and sank down dripping and panting.\r\n\r\nHe had made the crossing but he did not forget to be ready. He rapidly\r\nreloaded his rifle, and fastened the pistols at his belt. Then he looked\r\nthrough the bushes at the river. The two canoemen, water running from\r\nthem in streams, were on the other bank, though a little farther down\r\nthe stream. He believed that they were no longer silent. He fondly\r\nimagined that they were cursing hard, if not loud.\r\n\r\nHis relief was so great that, forgetting his own bedraggled condition,\r\nhe laughed. Then he looked again to see what they were going to do. A\r\nsmall man, his face shaded by the broad brim of a hat, emerged from the\r\nwoods and joined them. Dick was too far away to see his face, even\r\nhad it been uncovered, but his figure looked familiar. Nevertheless,\r\nalthough he tried hard, he could not recall where he had seen him\r\nbefore. But, as he carried a long-barreled rifle, Dick was sure that\r\nthis was his unknown pursuer. There had certainly been collusion\r\nalso between him and the men in the boat, as the three began to talk\r\nearnestly, and to point toward the woods on the other side.\r\n\r\nDick felt that he had avenged himself upon the boatmen, but his rage\r\nrose high against the little man under the broad-brimmed hat. It was he\r\nwho had followed him so long, and who had tried ruthlessly to kill him.\r\nThe lad's rifle was of the most improved make and a bullet would reach.\r\nHe was tempted to try it, but prudence came to his rescue. Still lying\r\nclose he watched them. He felt sure that they would soon be hunting for\r\nhis footprints, but he resolved to stay in his covert, until they began\r\nthe crossing of the river, to which his trail would lead when they found\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe saw them cease talking and begin searching among the woods. It might\r\nbe at least a half-hour before they found the trail and his strength\r\nwould be restored fully then. His sinking of the canoe had been in\r\nreality a triumph, and so he remained at ease, watching the ford.\r\n\r\nHe was quite sure that when his trail was found the little man would\r\nbe the one to find it, and sure enough at the end of a half-hour the\r\nweazened figure led down to the ford. Dick might have shot one of them\r\nin the water, but he had no desire to take life. It would serve no\r\npurpose, and, refreshed and strengthened, he set out through the forest\r\ntoward Jackson.\r\n\r\nHe came to a brook soon, and, remembering the old device of Indian\r\ntimes, he waded in it at least a half-mile. When he left it he passed\r\nthrough a stretch of wood, crossed an old cotton field and entered the\r\nwoods again. Then he sat down and ate from his store, feeling that he\r\nhad shaken off his pursuers. Another examination of his map followed. He\r\nhad kept fixed in his mind the point at which he was to find Hertford,\r\nand, being a good judge of direction, he felt sure that he could yet\r\nreach it.\r\n\r\nThe sun, now high and warm, had dried his clothing, and, after the food,\r\nhe was ready for another long march. He struck into a path and walked\r\nalong it, coming soon to a house which stood back a little distance from\r\na road into which the path merged. A man and two women standing on the\r\nporch stared at him curiously, but he pretended to take no notice. After\r\nlong exposure to weather, blue uniforms did not differ much from gray,\r\nand his own was now covered with mud. He could readily pass as a soldier\r\nof the Confederacy unless they chose to ask too many questions.\r\n\r\n“From General Pemberton's army?” called the man, when he was opposite\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nDick nodded and stepped a little faster.\r\n\r\n“Won't you stop for a bite and fresh water with friends of the cause?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, but important dispatches. Must hurry.” They repeated the\r\ninvitation. He shook his head, and went on. He did not look back, but he\r\nwas sure that they stared at him as long as he was in sight. Then, for\r\nsafety's sake, he left the road and entered the wood once more.\r\n\r\nHe had now come to country comparatively free from swamp and marsh, and\r\npursued his way through a great forest, beautiful with live oaks and\r\nmagnolias. In the afternoon he took a long rest by the side of a clear\r\nspring, where he drew further upon the store of food in his saddlebags,\r\nwhich he calculated held enough for another day. After that he would\r\nhave to forage upon the country.\r\n\r\nHe would sleep the second night in the forest, his blanket being\r\nsufficient protection, unless rain came, which he would have to endure\r\nas best he could. Another look at his map and he believed that on the\r\nfollowing afternoon he could reach Hertford.\r\n\r\nHe took the remaining food from his saddlebags, wrapped it in his\r\nblanket, and strapped the pack on his back. Then, in order to lighten\r\nhis burden, he hung the saddlebags on the bough of a tree and abandoned\r\nthem, after which he pressed forward through the woods with renewed\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nHe came at times to the edge of the forest and saw houses in the fields,\r\nbut he always turned back among the trees. He could find only enemies\r\nhere, and he knew that it was his plan to avoid all human beings.\r\nPrecept and example are of great power and he recalled again much that\r\nhe had heard of his famous ancestor, Paul Cotter. He had been compelled\r\nto fight often for his life and again to flee for it from an enemy who\r\nreserved torture and death for the captured. Dick felt that he must do\r\nas well, and the feeling increased his vigor and courage.\r\n\r\nA little later he heard a note, low, faint and musical. It was behind\r\nhim, but he was sure at first that it was made by negroes singing. It\r\nwas a pleasing sound. The negro had a great capacity for happiness, and\r\nDick as a young lad had played with and liked the young colored lads of\r\nhis age.\r\n\r\nBut as he walked on he heard the low, musical note once more and, as\r\nbefore, directly behind him. It seemed a little nearer. He paused and\r\nlistened. It came again, always nearer and nearer, and now it did not\r\nseem as musical as before. There was a sinister thread in that flowing\r\nnote, and suddenly Dick remembered.\r\n\r\nHe was a daring horseman and with his uncle and cousin and others at\r\nPendleton he had often ridden after the fox. It was the note of the\r\nhounds, but of bloodhounds, and this time they were following him. From\r\nthe first he had not the slightest doubt of it. Somebody, some traitor\r\nin the Union camp, knew the nature of his errand, and was hanging on to\r\nthe pursuit like death.\r\n\r\nDick knew it was the little man whom he had seen by the river, and\r\nperhaps the canoemen were with him--he would certainly have comrades,\r\nor his own danger would be too great--and they had probably obtained the\r\nbloodhounds at a farmhouse. Nearly everybody in Mississippi kept hounds.\r\n\r\nThe long whining note came again and much nearer. Now all music was gone\r\nfrom it for Dick. It was ferocious, like the howl of the wolf seeking\r\nprey, and he could not restrain a shudder. His danger had returned with\r\ntwofold force, because the hounds would unerringly lead his pursuers\r\nthrough the forest as fast as they could follow.\r\n\r\nHe did not yet despair. A new resolution was drawn from the depths of\r\nhis courage. He did not forget that he was a good marksman and he\r\nhad both rifle and pistols. He tried to calculate from that whining,\r\nferocious note how many hounds were pursuing, and he believed they were\r\nnot many. Now he prepared for battle, and, as he ran, he kept his eye on\r\nthe ground in order that he might choose his own field.\r\n\r\nHe saw it presently, a mass of fallen timber thrown together by a great\r\nstorm, and he took his place on the highest log, out of reach of a\r\nleaping hound. Then, lying almost flat on the log and with his rifle\r\nready, he waited, his heart beating hard with anger that he should be\r\npursued thus like an animal.\r\n\r\nThe howling of the hounds grew more ferocious, and it was tinged with\r\njoy. The trail had suddenly grown very hot, and they knew that the\r\nquarry was just before them. Dick caught a good view of a long, lean,\r\nracing figure bounding among the trees, and he fired straight at a spot\r\nbetween the blazing eyes. The hound fell without a sound, and with equal\r\nease he slew the second. The third and last drew back, although the lad\r\nheard the distant halloo of men seeking to drive him on.\r\n\r\nDick sprang from his log and ran through the forest again. He knew\r\nthat the lone hound after his first recoil would follow, but he had his\r\nreloaded rifle and he had proved that he knew how to shoot. It would\r\nplease him for the hound to come within range.\r\n\r\nWhen he took to renewed flight the hound again whined ferociously and\r\nDick glanced back now and then seeking a shot. Once he caught a glimpse\r\nof two or three dusky figures some distance behind the hound, urging\r\nhim on, and his heart throbbed with increased rage. If they presented an\r\nequal target he would fire at them rather than the hound.\r\n\r\nHe could run no longer, and his gait sank to a walk. His very exhaustion\r\nbrought him his opportunity, as the animal came rapidly within range,\r\nand Dick finished him with a single lucky shot. Then, making an extreme\r\neffort, he fled on a long time, and, while he was fleeing, he saw the\r\nsun set and the night come.\r\n\r\nThe strain upon him had been so great that his nerves and brain were\r\nunsteady. Although the forest was black with night he saw it through a\r\nblood-red mist. Something in him was about to burst, and when he saw a\r\nhuman figure rising up before him it broke and he fell.\r\n\r\nDick was unconscious a long time. But when he awoke he found himself\r\nwrapped in a blanket, while another was doubled under his head. It was\r\npitchy dark, but he beheld the outline of a human figure, sitting by his\r\nside. He strove to rise, but a powerful hand on his shoulder pushed him\r\nback, though gently, and a low voice said:\r\n\r\n“Stay still, Mr. Mason. We mustn't make any sound now!”\r\n\r\nDick recognized in dim wonder the voice of Sergeant Daniel Whitley. How\r\nhe had come there at such a time, and what he was doing now was past all\r\nguessing, but Sergeant Whitley was a most competent man. He knew more\r\nthan most generals, and he was filled with the lore of the woods. He\r\nwould trust him. He let his head sink back on the folded blanket, and\r\nhis heavy eyes closed again.\r\n\r\nWhen Dick roused from his stupor the sergeant was still by his side,\r\nand, as his eyes grew used to the darkness, he noticed that Whitley was\r\nreally kneeling rather than sitting, crouched to meet danger, his finger\r\non the trigger of a rifle. Dick's brain cleared and he sat up.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Sergeant?” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“I see you're all right now, Mr. Mason,” the sergeant whispered back,\r\n“but be sure you don't stir.”\r\n\r\n“Is it the Johnnies?”\r\n\r\n“Lean over a little and look down into that dip.”\r\n\r\nDick did so, and saw four men hunting among the trees, and the one\r\nwho seemed to be their leader was the little weazened fellow, with the\r\ngreat, flap-brimmed hat.\r\n\r\n“They're looking for your trail,” whispered the sergeant, “but they\r\nwon't find it. It's too dark, even for a Sioux Indian, and I've seen\r\nthem do some wonderful things in trailing.”\r\n\r\n“I seem to have met you in time, Sergeant.”\r\n\r\n“So you did, sir, but more of that later. Perhaps you'd better lie down\r\nagain, as you're weak yet. I'll tell you all they do.”\r\n\r\n“I'll take your advice, Sergeant, but am I sound and whole? I felt\r\nsomething in me break, and then the earth rose up and hit me in the\r\nface.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon it was just the last ounce of breath going out of you with a\r\npop. They're hunting hard, Mr. Mason, but they can't pick up the trace\r\nof a footstep. Slade must be mad clean through.”\r\n\r\n“Slade! Slade! Who's Slade?”\r\n\r\n“Slade is a spy partly, and an outlaw mostly, 'cause he often works on\r\nhis own hook. He's the weazened little fellow with so much hat-brim, and\r\nhe's about twenty different kinds of a demon. You've plenty of reason to\r\nfear him, and it's lucky we've met.”\r\n\r\n“It's more than luck for me, Sergeant. It's salvation. I believe it\r\nwouldn't have been half as hard on me if somebody had been with me, and\r\nyou're the first whom I would have chosen. Are they still in the dip,\r\nSergeant?”\r\n\r\n“No, they've passed to the slope on the right, and I think they'll go\r\nover the hill. We're safe here so long as we remain quiet; that is, safe\r\nfor the time. Slade will hang on as long as there's a possible chance to\r\nfind us.”\r\n\r\n“Sergeant, if they do happen to stumble upon us in the dark I hope\r\nyou'll promise to do one thing for me.”\r\n\r\n“I'll do anything I can, Mr. Mason.”\r\n\r\n“Kill Slade first. That little villain gives me the horrors. I believe\r\nthe soul of the last bloodhound I shot has been reincarnated in him.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Mr. Mason,” returned the sergeant, placidly, “if we have to\r\nfight I'll make sure of Slade at once. Is there anybody else you'd like\r\nspecially to have killed?”\r\n\r\n“No thank you, Sergeant. I don't hate any of the others, and I suppose\r\nthey'd have dropped the chase long ago if it hadn't been for this fellow\r\nwhom you call Slade. Now, I think I'll lie quiet, while you watch.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir. I'll tell you everything I can see. They're passing\r\nover the hill out of sight, and if they return I won't fail to let you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nSergeant Whitley, a man of vast physical powers, hardened by the long\r\nservice of forest and plain, was not weary at all, and, in the dusk, he\r\nlooked down with sympathy and pity at the lad who had closed his eyes.\r\nHe divined the nature of the ordeal through which he had gone. Dick's\r\nface, still badly swollen from the bites of the mosquitoes, showed\r\nall the signs of utter exhaustion. The sergeant could see, despite the\r\ndarkness, that it was almost the face of the dead, and he knew that\r\nhappy chance had brought him in the moment of Dick's greatest need.\r\n\r\nHe ceased to whisper, because Dick, without intending it, had gone\r\nto sleep again. Then the wary veteran scouted in a circle about their\r\nrefuge, but did not discover the presence of an enemy.\r\n\r\nHe sat down near the sleeping lad, with his rifle between his knees,\r\nand watched the moon come out. Owing to his wilderness experience he had\r\nbeen chosen also to go on a scout toward Jackson, though he preferred to\r\nmake his on foot, and the sound of Dick's shots at the hounds had drawn\r\nhim to an observation which finally turned into a rescue.\r\n\r\nAfter midnight the sergeant slept a little while, but he never awakened\r\nDick until it was almost morning. Then he told him that he would go with\r\nhim on the mission to Hertford, and Dick was very glad.\r\n\r\n“What's become of Slade and his men?” asked Dick.\r\n\r\n“I don't know,” replied the sergeant, “but as they lost the trail in the\r\nnight, it's pretty likely they're far from here. At any rate they're not\r\nbothering us just now. How're you feeling, Mr. Mason?”\r\n\r\n“Fine, except that my face still burns.”\r\n\r\n“We'll have to hold up a Confederate house somewhere and get oil of\r\npennyroyal. That'll cure you, but I guess you've learned now, Mr.\r\nMason, that mosquitoes in a southern swamp are just about as deadly as\r\nbullets.”\r\n\r\n“So they are, Sergeant, and this is not my first experience. Luck has\r\nbeen terribly against me this trip, but it turned when I met you last\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Mason. In this case two rifles are better than one. We're\r\nprowling right through the heart of the Confederacy, but I'm thinking\r\nwe'll make it. We've got a great general now, and we mustn't fail to\r\nbring up Colonel Hertford and his cavalry. I've an idea in my head that\r\nGeneral Grant is going to carry through big plans.”\r\n\r\n“Then I think it's time we were starting.”\r\n\r\n“So do I, Mr. Mason, and now will you take these crackers and smoked\r\nham? I've plenty in my knapsack. I learned on the plains never to travel\r\nwithout a food supply. If a soldier starves to death what use is he to\r\nhis army? And I reckon you need something to eat. You were about tired\r\nout when I met you last night.”\r\n\r\n“I surely was, Sergeant, but I'm a new man this morning. You and I\r\ntogether can't fail.”\r\n\r\nDick, in truth, felt an enormous relief. He and his young comrades had\r\nlearned to trust Sergeant Whitley implicitly, with his experience of\r\nforest and plain and his infinite resource.\r\n\r\n“Where do you figure we are, Sergeant?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“In the deep woods, Mr. Mason, but we haven't turned much from the line\r\nleading you to the place where you were to meet Colonel Hertford. You\r\nhaven't really lost time, and we'll start again straight ahead, but\r\nwe've got to look out for this fellow Slade, who's as tricky and\r\nmerciless as they ever make 'em.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me more about Slade, Sergeant.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know a lot, but I heard of him from some of our scouts. He was\r\nan overseer of a big plantation before the war. From somewhere up North,\r\nI think, but now he's more of a rebel than the rebels themselves. Often\r\nhappens that way. But you've got to reckon with him.”\r\n\r\n“Glad I know that much. He reminds me of a man I've seen, though I can't\r\nrecall where or when. It's enough, though, to watch out for Slade. Come\r\non, Sergeant, I'm feeling so fine now that with your help I'm able to\r\nfight a whole army.”\r\n\r\nThe two striding through the forest, started toward the meeting place\r\nwith Hertford. Now that he had the powerful comradeship of Sergeant\r\nWhitley, the wilderness became beautiful instead of gloomy for Dick.\r\nThe live oaks and magnolias were magnificent, and there was a wild\r\nluxuriance of vegetation. Birds of brilliant plumage darted among the\r\nfoliage, and squirrels chattered on the boughs. He saw bear tracks\r\nagain, and called the sergeant's attention to them.\r\n\r\n“It would be nice to be hunting them, instead of men,” said Whitley.\r\n“You can find nice, black fellows down here, good to eat, and it's a\r\ndeal safer to hunt them than it is the grizzlies and silver-tips of the\r\nRockies.”\r\n\r\nThey saw now much cleared land, mostly cotton fields, and now and then\r\na white man or a negro working, but there was always enough forest\r\nfor cover. They waded the numerous brooks and creeks, allowing their\r\nclothing to dry in the warm sun, as they marched, and about two hours\r\nbefore sunrise the sergeant, wary and always suspicious, suggested that\r\nthey stop a while.\r\n\r\n“I've an idea,” he said, “that Slade and his men are still following us.\r\nOh, he's an ugly fellow, full of sin, and if they're not far behind us\r\nwe ought to know it.”\r\n\r\n“Just as you say,” said Dick, glad enough to shift the responsibility\r\nupon such capable shoulders. “How would this clump of bushes serve for a\r\nhiding place while we wait?”\r\n\r\n“Good enough. Indians pursued, often ambush the pursuer, and as we've\r\ntwo good men with two good rifles, Mr. Mason, we'll just see what this\r\nSlade is about.”\r\n\r\n“When I last saw him,” said Dick, “he had the two canoemen with him, and\r\nperhaps they've picked up the owner of the hounds.”\r\n\r\n“That's sure, and they're likely to be four. We're only two, but we've\r\ngot the advantage of the ambush, and that's a big one. If you agree\r\nwith me, Mr. Mason, we'll wait here for 'em. We were sent out to take\r\nmessages, not to fight, but since these fellows hang on our trail we may\r\nget to Colonel Hertford all the quicker because we do fight.”\r\n\r\n“Your opinion's mine too, Sergeant. I'm not in love with battle, but I\r\nwouldn't mind taking a shot or two at these men. They've given me a lot\r\nof trouble.”\r\n\r\nThe sergeant smiled.\r\n\r\n“That's the way it goes,” he said. “You don't get mad at anybody in\r\nparticular in a big battle, but if two or three fellows lay around in\r\nthe woods popping away at you you soon get so you lose any objections to\r\nkilling, and you draw a bead on 'em as soon as a chance comes.”\r\n\r\n“That's the way I feel, Sergeant. It isn't Christian, but I suppose it\r\nhas some sort of excuse.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it has. Drop a little lower, Mr. Mason. I see the bushes out\r\nthere shaking.”\r\n\r\n“And that's the sign that Slade and his men have come. Well, I'm not\r\nsorry.”\r\n\r\nBoth Dick and the sergeant lay almost flat with their heads raised a\r\nlittle, and their rifles pushed forward. The bushes ceased to shake,\r\nbut Dick had no doubt their pursuers were before them. They had probably\r\ndivined, too, that the quarry was at bay and was dangerous. Evidently\r\nthe sergeant had been correct when he said Slade was full of craft and\r\ncunning.\r\n\r\nWhile they waited the spirit of Dick's famous ancestor descended upon\r\nhim in a yet greater measure. Their pursuers were not Indians, but this\r\nwas the deep wilderness and they were merely on a skirt of the great\r\nwar. Many of the border conditions were reproduced, and they were to\r\nfight as borderers fought.\r\n\r\n“What do you think they're doing?” Dick whispered.\r\n\r\n“Feeling around for us. Slade won't take any more risk than he has to.\r\nDid you see those two birds fly away from that bough, sudden-like? I\r\nthink one of the men has just crept under it. But the fellow who exposes\r\nhimself first won't be Slade.”\r\n\r\nDick's inherited instinct was strong, and he watched not only in front,\r\nbut to right and left also. He knew that cunning men would seek to flank\r\nand surprise them, and he noticed that the sergeant also watched in a\r\nwide circle. He still drew tremendous comfort from the presence of the\r\nskillful veteran, feeling that his aid would make the repulse of Slade a\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nA rifle cracked suddenly in the bushes to their right, and then another\r\nby his side cracked so suddenly that only a second came between. Dick\r\nheard a bullet whistle over their heads, but he believed that the one\r\nfrom his comrade's rifle had struck true.\r\n\r\n“I've no way of telling just now,” said the sergeant, calmly, “but I\r\ndon't believe that fellow will bother any more. If we can wing another\r\nthey're likely to let us alone and we can go on. They must know by\r\nthe trail that we're now two instead of one, and that their danger has\r\ndoubled.”\r\n\r\nDick had felt that the danger to their pursuers had more than doubled.\r\nHe had an immense admiration for the sergeant, who was surely showing\r\nhimself a host. The man, trained so long in border war, was thoroughly\r\nin his element. His thick, powerful figure was drawn up in the fashion\r\nof a panther about to spring. Bulky as he was he showed ease and grace,\r\nand wary eyes, capable of reading every sign, continually scanned the\r\nthickets.\r\n\r\n“They know just where we are, of course,” whispered the sergeant, “but\r\nif we stay close they'll never get a good shot at us.”\r\n\r\nDick caught sight of a head among some bushes and fired. The head\r\ndropped back so quickly that he could not tell whether or not his bullet\r\nsped true. After a long wait the sergeant suggested that they creep\r\naway.\r\n\r\n“I think they've had enough,” he said. “They've certainly lost one man,\r\nand maybe two. Slade won't care to risk much more.”\r\n\r\nDick was glad to go and, following the sergeant's lead, he crawled four\r\nor five hundred yards, a most painful but necessary operation. Then they\r\nstood up, and made good time through the forest. Both would have been\r\nwilling to stay and fight it out with Slade and what force he had left,\r\nbut their mission was calling them, and forward they went.\r\n\r\n“Do you think they'll follow us?” asked Dick.\r\n\r\n“I reckon they've had enough. They may try to curve ahead of us and give\r\nwarning, but the salute from the muzzles of our rifles has been too warm\r\nfor any more direct pursuit. Besides, we're going to have a summer storm\r\nsoon, and like as not they'll be hunting shelter.”\r\n\r\nDick, in the excitement of battle and flight, had not noticed the\r\ndarkening skies and the rising wind. Clouds, heavy and menacing, already\r\nshrouded the whole west. Low thunder was heard far in the distance.\r\n\r\n“It's going to be a whopper,” said the sergeant, “something like those\r\nbig storms they have out on the plains. We must find shelter somewhere,\r\nMr. Mason, or it will leave us so bedraggled and worn out that for a\r\nlong time we won't be able to move on.”\r\n\r\nDick agreed with him entirely, but neither yet knew where the shelter\r\nwas to be found. They hurried on, looking hopefully for a place.\r\nMeanwhile the storm, its van a continual blaze of lightning and roar of\r\nthunder, rolled up fast from the southwest. Then the lightning ceased\r\nfor a while and the skies were almost dark. Dick knew that the rain\r\nwould come soon, and, as he looked eagerly for shelter, he saw a\r\nclearing in which stood a small building of logs.\r\n\r\n“A cornfield, Sergeant,” he exclaimed, “and that I take it is a crib.”\r\n\r\n“A crib that will soon house more than corn,” said the sergeant. “Two\r\ngood Union soldiers are about to stop there. It's likely the farmer's\r\nhouse itself is just beyond that line of trees, but he won't be coming\r\nout to this crib to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Not likely. Too much darkness and rain. Hurry, Sergeant, I can hear\r\nalready the rush of the rain in the forest.”\r\n\r\nThey ran across the field, burst open the door of the crib, leaped in\r\nand banged the door shut again, just as the van of the rain beat upon it\r\nwith an angry rush.\r\n\r\nSave for a crack or two they had no light, but they stood upon a dry\r\nfloor covered deep with corn shucks, and heard the rain sweep and roar\r\nupon the roof. On one side was a heap of husked corn which they quickly\r\npiled against the door in order to hold it before the assaults of the\r\nwind, and then they sought warm places among the shucks.\r\n\r\nIt was a small crib, and the rain drove in at the cracks, but it\r\nfurnished abundant shelter for its two new guests. Dick had never been\r\nin a finer hotel. He lay warm and dry in a great heap of shucks, and\r\nheard the wind and rain beat vainly upon walls and roof and the thunder\r\nrumble as it moved off toward the east. He felt to the full the power of\r\ncontrast.\r\n\r\n“Fine in here, isn't it, Sergeant?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Fine as silk,” replied the sergeant from his own heap of shucks. “We\r\nplayed in big luck to find this place, 'cause I think it's going to rain\r\nhard all night.”\r\n\r\n“Let it. It can't get me. Sergeant, I've always known that corn is our\r\nchief staple, but I never knew before that the shucks, which so neatly\r\nenclose the grains and cob, were such articles of luxury. I'm lying upon\r\nthe most magnificent bed in the United States, and it's composed wholly\r\nof shucks.”\r\n\r\n“It's no finer than mine, Mr. Mason.”\r\n\r\n“That's so. Yours is just like mine, and, of course, it's an exception.\r\nNow, I wish to say, Sergeant, the rain upon the roof is so soothing that\r\nI'm likely to go to sleep before I know it.”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead, Mr. Mason, and it's more'n likely I'll follow. All trails\r\nwill be destroyed by the storm and nobody will think of looking here for\r\nus to-night.”\r\n\r\nBoth soon slept soundly, and all through the night the rain beat upon\r\nthe roof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. A BOLD ATTACK\r\n\r\n\r\nDick was the first to awake. The sergeant had not slept the night before\r\nat all, and, despite his enormous endurance, he was overpowered. Having\r\nfallen once into slumber he remained there long.\r\n\r\nIt was not yet morning and the rain was yet falling steadily. Its sweep\r\nupon the roof was still so pleasant and soothing that Dick resolved to\r\ngo to sleep again, after he had looked about a little. He had grown used\r\nto dusk and he could see just a little. The sergeant, buried all but his\r\nhead among the corn shucks, was breathing deeply and peacefully.\r\n\r\nHe looked out at one of the cracks, but he saw only rain sweeping by\r\nin misty sheets. The road that ran by the field was invisible. He gave\r\ndevout thanks that this tight little corn crib had put itself in their\r\nway. Then he returned to his slumbers, and when he awoke again the\r\nsergeant was sitting by one of the cracks smoothing his thick hair with\r\na small comb.\r\n\r\n“I always try to keep as neat as I can, Mr. Mason,” he said, apologizing\r\nfor such weakness. “It gives you more courage, and if I get killed I\r\nwant to make a decent body. Here's your breakfast, sir. There's enough\r\nleft for the two of us, and I've divided it equally.”\r\n\r\nCold ham, bacon and crackers were laid out on clean shucks, and they ate\r\nuntil nothing was left. It was now full daylight, and the rain was dying\r\naway to a sprinkle. The farmer might come out at any time to his crib,\r\nand they felt that they must be up and away.\r\n\r\nThey bade farewell to their pleasant shelter of a night, and, after\r\npulling through the deep mud of the field, entered again the forest,\r\nwhich was now soaking wet.\r\n\r\n“If Colonel Hertford is near where we reckon he is we ought to meet him\r\nby nightfall,” said Sergeant Whitley.\r\n\r\n“We're sure to reach him before then,” said Dick joyously.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Hertford is a mighty good man, and if he says he's going to\r\nbe at a certain place at a certain time I reckon he'll be there, Mr.\r\nMason.”\r\n\r\n“And then we'll bring him back and join General Grant. What do you think\r\nof our General, Sergeant?”\r\n\r\nDick spoke with all the freedom then so prevalent in the American\r\narmies, where officer and man were often on nearly a common footing, and\r\nthe sergeant replied with equal freedom.\r\n\r\n“General Grant hits and hammers, and I guess that's what war is,”\r\n he said. “On the plains we had a colonel who didn't know much about\r\ntactics. He said the only way to put down hostile Indians was to find\r\n'em, and beat 'em, and I guess that plan will work in any war, big or\r\nlittle.”\r\n\r\n“I heard before I left the army that Washington was getting scared,\r\nafraid that he was taking too big a risk here in the heart of the\r\nConfederacy, and that his operations might be checked by orders from the\r\ncapital.”\r\n\r\nSergeant Whitley smiled a wise smile.\r\n\r\n“We sergeants learn to know the officers,” he said, “and I've had the\r\nchance to look at General Grant a lot. He doesn't say much, but I guess\r\nhe's doing a powerful lot of thinking, while he's chawing on the end of\r\nhis cigar. You notice, Mr. Mason, that he takes risks.”\r\n\r\n“He took a big one at Shiloh, and came mighty near being nipped.”\r\n\r\n“But he wasn't nipped after all, and now, if I can judge by the signs,\r\nhe's going to take another chance here. I wouldn't be surprised if he\r\nturned and marched away from the Mississippi, say toward Jackson.”\r\n\r\n“But that wouldn't be taking Vicksburg.”\r\n\r\n“No, but he might whip an army of the Johnnies coming to relieve\r\nVicksburg, and I've a sneaking idea that the General has another daring\r\nthought in mind.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, Sergeant?”\r\n\r\n“When he turns eastward he'll be away from the telegraph. Maybe he\r\ndoesn't want to receive any orders from the capital just now.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you've hit it, Sergeant. At least I hope so, and anyway we\r\nwant to reach Colonel Hertford right away.”\r\n\r\nStill following the map and also consulting their own judgment, they\r\nadvanced now at a good rate. But as they came into a more thickly\r\npopulated country they were compelled to be exceedingly wary. Once a\r\nfarmer insisted on questioning them, but they threatened him with their\r\nrifles and then plunged into a wood, lest he bring a force in pursuit.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, lying among some bushes, they saw a large Confederate\r\nforce, with four cannon, pass on the road toward Jackson.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Hertford might do them a lot of damage if he could fall on them\r\nwith his cavalry,” said the sergeant thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“So he could,” said Dick, “but I imagine that General Grant wants the\r\ncolonel to come at once.”\r\n\r\nThey turned northward now and an hour later found numerous hoofprints in\r\na narrow road.\r\n\r\n“All these were made by well-shod horses,” said the sergeant, after\r\nexamining the tracks critically. “Now, we've plenty of horseshoes and\r\nthe Johnnies haven't. That's one sign.”\r\n\r\n“What's the other?”\r\n\r\n“I calculate that about six hundred men have passed here, and that's\r\npretty close to the number Colonel Hertford has, unless he's been in a\r\nhot fight.”\r\n\r\n“Good reasoning, Sergeant, and I'll add a third. Those men are riding\r\ndirectly toward the place where, according to our maps and information,\r\nwe ought to meet Colonel Hertford.”\r\n\r\n“All these things make me sure our men have passed here, Mr. Mason.\r\nSuppose we follow on as hard as we can?”\r\n\r\nCheered by the belief that they were approaching the end of their quest\r\nthey advanced at such a rate that the great trail rapidly grew fresher.\r\n\r\n“Their horses are tired now,” said the sergeant, “and likely we're going\r\nas fast as they are. They're our men sure. Look at this old canteen that\r\none of 'em has thrown away. It's the kind they make in the North. He\r\nought to have been punished for leaving such a sign.”\r\n\r\n“I judge, Sergeant, from the looks of this road, that they can't now be\r\nmore than a mile away.”\r\n\r\n“Less than that, Mr. Mason. When we reach the top of the hill yonder I\r\nthink we'll see 'em.”\r\n\r\nThe sergeant's judgment was vindicated again. From the crest they saw a\r\nnumerous body of muddy horsemen riding slowly ahead. Only the brilliant\r\nsunlight made their uniforms distinguishable, but they were, beyond a\r\ndoubt, the troops of the Union. Dick uttered a little cry of joy and the\r\nsergeant's face glowed.\r\n\r\n“We've found 'em,” said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n“And soon we ride,” said Dick.\r\n\r\nThey hurried forward, shouted and waved their rifles.\r\n\r\nThe column stopped, and two men, one of whom was Colonel Hertford\r\nhimself, rode back, looking curiously at the haggard and stained faces\r\nof the two who walked forward, still swinging their rifles.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Hertford,” said Dick joyfully, “we've come with a message for\r\nyou from General Grant.”\r\n\r\n“And who may you be?” asked Hertford in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Why, Colonel, don't you know me? I'm Lieutenant Richard Mason of\r\nColonel Winchester's regiment, and this is Sergeant Daniel Whitley of\r\nthe same regiment.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel broke into a hearty laugh, and then extended his hand to\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n“I should have known your voice, my boy,” he said, “but it's certainly\r\nimpossible to recognize any one who is as thickly covered with dry\r\nMississippi mud as you are. What's your news, Dick?”\r\n\r\nDick told him and the sergeant repeated the same tale. He knew them both\r\nto be absolutely trustworthy, and their coming on such an errand through\r\nso many dangers carried its own proof.\r\n\r\n“We've several spare horses, bearing provisions and arms,” said Colonel\r\nHertford. “Two can be unloaded and be made ready for you and the\r\nsergeant. I fancy that you don't care to keep on walking, Dick?”\r\n\r\n“I've had enough to last me for years, Colonel.”\r\n\r\nThey were mounted in a few minutes, and rode with the colonel. The world\r\nhad now changed for Dick. Astride a good horse and in a column of six\r\nhundred men he was no longer the hunted. These troopers and he were\r\nhunters now.\r\n\r\nThe column turned presently into another road and advanced with speed in\r\nthe direction of Grant. Colonel Hertford asked Dick many questions about\r\nSlade.\r\n\r\n“I've been hearing of him since we were on this raid,” he said. “He's\r\nmore of a guerilla than a regular soldier, but he may be able to gather\r\na considerable force. I wish we could cut him off.”\r\n\r\n“So do I,” said Dick, but his feeling was prompted chiefly by Slade's\r\ndetermined attempts upon his life.\r\n\r\nColonel Hertford now pushed forward his men. He, too, was filled with\r\nambitions. He began to have an idea of Grant's great plans, in which\r\nall the Union leaders must cooperate, and he meant that his own little\r\ncommand should be there, whenever the great deed, whatever it might be,\r\nwas done. He talked about it with Dick, who he knew was a trusted\r\nyoung staff officer, and the two, the lad and the older man, fed the\r\nenthusiasm of each other.\r\n\r\nThis attack deep into the flank of the Confederacy appealed to them with\r\nits boldness, and created a certain romantic glow that seemed to clothe\r\nthe efforts of a general so far from the great line of battle in the\r\nEast. They talked, too, of the navy which had run past forts on the\r\nMississippi, and which had shown anew all its ancient skill and courage.\r\n\r\nAs they talked, twilight came, and the road led once more through the\r\ndeep woods, where the shade turned the twilight into the darkness of\r\nnight. Then rifles flashed suddenly in the thickets, and a half-dozen\r\nhorsemen fell. The whole column was thrown for an instant or two into\r\ndisorder, frightened horses rearing and stamping, and, before their\r\nriders could regain control, another volley came, emptying a half-dozen\r\nsaddles.\r\n\r\nColonel Hertford gave rapid commands. Then, shouting and waving his\r\nsaber he galloped boldly into the forest, reckless of trees and bushes,\r\nand Dick, the sergeant, and the whole troop followed. The lad was nearly\r\nswept from his horse by a bough, but he recovered himself in time to see\r\nthe figures of men on foot fleeing rapidly through the dusk.\r\n\r\nBullets pattered on bark and leaves, and the angry horsemen, after\r\ndischarging their carbines, swept forward with circling sabers. But the\r\nirregulars who had ambushed them, save a few fallen before the bullets,\r\nescaped easily in the dense woods, and under cover of the darkness which\r\nwas now coming down, thick and fast.\r\n\r\nA trumpet sounded the recall and the cavalrymen, sore and angry, drew\r\nback into the road. They had lost a dozen good men, but Colonel Hertford\r\nfelt that they could not delay for vengeance. Grant's orders were to\r\ncome at once; and he intended to obey them.\r\n\r\n“I'd wager a year's pay against a Confederate five-dollar note,” said\r\nSergeant Whitley to Dick, “that the man who laid that ambush was Slade.\r\nHe'll keep watch on us all the way to Grant, and he'll tell the Southern\r\nleaders everything the general is doing. Oh, he's a good scout and spy.”\r\n\r\n“He's proved it,” said Dick, “and I'd like to get a fair shot at him.”\r\n\r\nThey rode nearly all night and most of the next day, and, in the\r\nafternoon, they met other men in blue who told them that a heavy Union\r\nforce was advancing. They had no doubt now that Grant's great plan was\r\nalready working and in a short time they reached McPherson, advancing\r\nwith Logan's division. Hertford reported at once to McPherson, who was\r\nglad enough to have his cavalry, and who warmly praised Dick and the\r\nsergeant for the dangerous service they had done so well. As it would\r\nhave been unwise for them to attempt to reach Grant then he kept them\r\nwith him in the march on Jackson.\r\n\r\nDick slept that night under the stars, but thousands of Union men were\r\naround him and he felt neither the weight of responsibility, nor the\r\npresence of danger. He missed Warner and Pennington, but he and the\r\nsergeant were happy. Beyond a doubt now Grant was going to strike\r\nhard, and all the men were full of anticipation and hope. His force in\r\ndifferent divisions was advancing on Jackson, leaving Vicksburg behind\r\nhim and the Southern army under Pemberton on one side.\r\n\r\nDick heard, too, that the redoubtable Joe Johnston was coming to take\r\ncommand of the Southern garrison in Jackson, and a leader less bold than\r\nGrant might have shrunk from such a circle of enemies, but Grant's own\r\ncourage increased the spirit of his men, and they were full of faith.\r\n\r\n“I expect they're alarmed in Washington,” said the sergeant, as they\r\nsat on their blankets. “There ain't any telegraph station nearer than\r\nMemphis. They've heard in the capital that the general has begun to move\r\ntoward Jackson, but they won't know for days what will happen.”\r\n\r\n“I don't blame the President for being disturbed,” said Dick. “After all\r\nthe army is to serve the nation and fights under the supreme civilian\r\nauthority. The armies don't govern.”\r\n\r\n“That's so, but there come times when the general who has to do the\r\nfighting can judge best how it ought to be done.”\r\n\r\nDick lay down on one blanket and put another over him. It was well into\r\nMay, which meant hot weather in Mississippi, but, if he could, he always\r\nprotected himself at night. He was not a vain lad, but he felt proud\r\nover his success. Hertford's six hundred horse were a welcome addition\r\nto any army.\r\n\r\nHe lay back soon with a knapsack as a pillow under his head and listened\r\nto the noises of the camp, blended now into a rather musical note.\r\nSeveral cooking fires still burned here and there and figures passed\r\nbefore them. Dick observed them sleepily, taking no particular note,\r\nuntil one, small and weazened, came. The figure was about fifty yards\r\naway, and there was a Union cap instead of a great flap-brimmed hat on\r\nthe head, but Dick sprang to his feet at once, snatched a pistol from\r\nhis belt and rushed toward it.\r\n\r\nThe evil figure melted away like a shadow, and two astonished soldiers\r\nseized the youth, who seemed to be running amuck in the camp, pistol in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Let go!” exclaimed Dick. “I've seen a man whom I know to be a spy, and\r\na most dangerous one, too.”\r\n\r\nThey could find no trace of Slade. Dick returned crestfallen to his\r\nblanket, but he recalled something now definitely and clearly. Slade\r\nwas the little man whom he had seen carrying the log the morning he left\r\nGeneral Grant's camp, on his mission.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant, who had never stirred from his own blanket, sat up when\r\nDick returned.\r\n\r\n“Who was he, Mr. Mason?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Slade himself. He must have seen me jump up, because he vanished like\r\na ghost. But I gained something. I know now that I saw him here in our\r\nuniform just before I started to find Colonel Hertford. That was why I\r\nwas followed.”\r\n\r\n“The cunning of an Indian. Well, we'll be on the watch for him now,\r\nbut I imagine he's already on the way to Jackson with the news of our\r\nadvance and an estimate of our numbers. We can't do anything to head him\r\noff.”\r\n\r\nOn the second day after joining the column Dick was ahead with the\r\ncavalry, riding beside Colonel Hertford, and listening to occasional\r\nshots in their front on the Jackson road. Both believed they would soon\r\nbe in touch with the enemy. Sergeant Whitley, acting now as a scout, had\r\ngone forward through a field and in a few minutes galloped back.\r\n\r\n“The enemy is not far away,” he said. “They're posted along a creek,\r\nwith high banks and in a wood. They've got a strong artillery too, and I\r\nthink they about equal us in numbers.”\r\n\r\nDick carried the report to the commander of the column, and soon the\r\ntrumpets were calling the men to battle. The crackle of rifle shots\r\nahead increased rapidly. The skirmishers were already pulling trigger,\r\nand, as Dick galloped back to Hertford he saw many puffs of white smoke\r\ndown the road and in the fields and woods on either side. The Union men\r\nbegan to cheer. In the West they had suffered no such defeats as their\r\nbrethren in the East, and every pulse beat with confidence. As the whole\r\nline moved forward the Southern cannon began to crash and their shells\r\nswept the road.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry were advancing in a field, but they were yet held back to\r\na slow walk. Dick heard many impatient exclamations, but he knew the\r\nrestraint was right. He saw the accuracy of the Southern gunners. They\r\nwere driving the Northern infantry from the road. Their fire was rapid\r\nand deadly, and, for a while, the Union army was checked.\r\n\r\nHertford was calmly examining the Southern position through his glasses,\r\nwhile he restrained his eager men. The volume of Southern fire was\r\ngrowing fast. Shells and shrapnel rained death over a wide area, and the\r\nair was filled with whistling bullets. It was certain destruction for\r\nany force to charge down the road in face of the Southern cannon, and\r\nthe Northern army began to spread out, wheeling toward either flank.\r\n\r\nAn aide arrived with an order to Hertford, and then he loosed his eager\r\ncavalry. Turning to one side they galloped toward the creek. Some of the\r\nSouthern gunners, seeing them, sent shells toward them, and a swarm\r\nof riflemen in a wood showered them with bullets. But they passed so\r\nrapidly that not many saddles were emptied, and the trumpeter blew a\r\nmellow note that urged on spirits already willing enough.\r\n\r\nThe sweep of the cavalry charge exhilarated Dick. The thought of danger\r\npassed away for the moment. He saw all around him the eager faces of\r\nmen, and horses that seemed just as eager. Dust and dirt flew beneath\r\nthe thudding hoofs, and the dust and floating smoke together made a\r\ngrimy cloud through which they galloped.\r\n\r\nThey passed around still further on the flank. They seemed, for a few\r\nminutes, to be leaving the battle, which was now at its height, the\r\nSouthern artillery still holding the road and presenting an unbroken\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nDick saw a flash of water and then the whole troop thundered into the\r\ncreek, almost without slackened rein. Up the bank they went, and with\r\na wild shout charged upon the Southern infantry. On the other flank\r\nanother Northern force which also had crossed the creek attacked with\r\nfire and spirit.\r\n\r\nBut the battle still swayed back and forth. Hertford and his cavalry\r\nwere thrown off, merely to return anew to the charge. A portion of\r\nthe Northern force was driven back on the creek. The strong Southern\r\nbatteries poured forth death. Dick felt that they might yet lose, but\r\nthey suddenly heard a tremendous cheer, and a fresh force coming up\r\nat the double quick enabled them to sweep the field. Before sunset the\r\nSouthern army retreated toward Jackson, leaving the field to the men in\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nDick dismounted and, examining himself carefully, found that he had\r\nsuffered no wound. Colonel Hertford and the sergeant had also taken no\r\nhurt. But the lad and his elder comrade secured but little rest. They\r\nwere bidden to ride across the country at once to General Sherman with\r\nthe news of the victory. Sherman was at the head of another column, and\r\nGrant was farther away with the main body.\r\n\r\nDick and the sergeant, with the battle smoke still in their eyes, were\r\neager for the service.\r\n\r\n“When you're with Grant you don't stay idle, that's certain,” said Dick\r\nas they rode across the darkening fields.\r\n\r\n“No, you don't,” said the sergeant, “and I'm thinking that we've just\r\nbegun. I know from the feel of it that big things are going to happen\r\nfast. Sheer away from the woods there, Mr. Mason. We don't want to be\r\npicked off by sharpshooters.”\r\n\r\nThey arrived after dark in Sherman's camp and he received them himself.\r\nDick remembered how he had seen this thin, dry man holding fast with his\r\ncommand at Shiloh, and he saluted him with the deepest respect. He knew\r\nthat here was a bold and tenacious spirit, kin to that of Grant. Sherman\r\nhad heard already of the battle, but he wished more and definite news.\r\n\r\n“You say that our victory was complete?” he asked tersely.\r\n\r\n“It was, sir,” replied Dick. “The entire force of the enemy retired\r\nrapidly toward Jackson, and our men are eager to advance on that city.”\r\n\r\n“It would be a great stroke to take the capital of Mississippi,” said\r\nSherman musingly. Then he added in his crisp manner:\r\n\r\n“Are you tired?”\r\n\r\n“Not if you wish me to do anything,” replied Dick quickly.\r\n\r\nSherman smiled.\r\n\r\n“The right spirit,” he said. “I wish you and your comrade to ride at\r\nonce with this news to General Grant. He may hear it from other sources,\r\nbut I want to send a letter by you.”\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes Dick and the sergeant were riding proudly away on another\r\nmission, and, passing through all the dangers of Southern scouts and\r\nskirmishers, they reached General Grant, to whom they delivered the\r\nletter from Sherman. Grant, who had recently been in doubt owing to the\r\nthreat of Pemberton on his flank, hesitated no longer when he heard of\r\nthe victory, and resolved at once upon the capture of Jackson.\r\n\r\nDick, after his battle and two rides, went to sleep in a wagon, while an\r\norderly took his horse. When he awoke unknown hours afterward he found\r\nthat he was moving. He knew at once that the army was advancing. Before\r\nhim and behind him he heard all the noises of the march, the beat of\r\nhorses' hoofs, the grinding of wheels, the clanking of cannon, the\r\ncracking of whips and the sounds of many voices.\r\n\r\nHe was wonderfully comfortable where he lay and he had the satisfaction\r\nand pride of much duty done. He felt that he was entitled to rest, and,\r\nturning on his side, he went to sleep again. After another unknown time\r\nhis second awakening came and he remained awake.\r\n\r\nHe quietly slipped out at the tail of the wagon, and stood for a few\r\nmoments, dazzled by the blazing sunlight. Then a loud, cheery voice\r\ncalled out:\r\n\r\n“Well, if it isn't our own Lucky Dick come back again, safe and well to\r\nthe people to whom he belongs!”\r\n\r\n“If z equals Dick and y equals his presence then we have z plus y, as\r\nDick is certainly present,” called out another voice not quite so loud,\r\nbut equally cheery. “Luck, Frank, is only a minor factor in life. What\r\nwe usually call luck is the result of foresight, skill and courage.\r\nThere are facts that I wouldn't have you to forget, even if it is a hot\r\nday far down in Mississippi.”\r\n\r\nWarner and Pennington sprang from their horses and greeted Dick warmly.\r\nThey had returned a day or two before from their own less perilous\r\nerrands, but they were in great anxiety about their comrade. They were\r\nglad too, when they heard that the sergeant had joined him and that he\r\nhad come back safe.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it means a battle at Jackson,” said Warner. “We're surely on\r\nthe move, and we're going to keep the Johnnies busy for quite a spell.”\r\n\r\n“Looks like it,” said Dick.\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester came soon, and his face showed great relief when he\r\nshook hands with Dick.\r\n\r\n“It was a dangerous errand, Dick, my lad,” he said, “but I felt that you\r\nwould succeed and you have. It was highly important that we gather all\r\nour forces for a great stroke.”\r\n\r\nDick resumed at once his old place in the Winchester regiment, with\r\nWarner, Pennington and his other comrades around him. Refreshed by\r\nabundant sleep and good food he was in the highest of spirits. They\r\nwere embarked upon a great adventure and he believed that it would be\r\nsuccessful. His confidence was shared by all those about him. Meanwhile\r\nthe army advanced in diverging columns upon the Mississippi capital.\r\n\r\nJackson, on Pearl River, had suddenly assumed a vast importance in\r\nDick's mind, and yet it was but a tiny place, not more than three or\r\nfour thousand inhabitants. The South was almost wholly agricultural,\r\nand cities, great in a political and military sense, were in reality but\r\ntowns. Richmond, itself the capital of the Confederacy, around which so\r\nmuch centered, had only forty thousand people.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment was detached that afternoon and sent to join the\r\ncolumn under McPherson, which was expected to reach Jackson first. Dick\r\nwas mounted again, and he rode with Warner and Pennington on either\r\nside of him. They speculated much on what they would find when they\r\napproached Jackson.\r\n\r\n“If Joe Johnston is there,” said Warner, “I think we'll have a hard\r\nfight. You'll remember that he did great work against us in Virginia,\r\nuntil he was wounded.”\r\n\r\n“And they'll know, of course, just when to expect us and in what force,”\r\n said Dick. “Slade will tell them that. He probably has a large body of\r\nspies and scouts working under him. But I don't think he'll come inside\r\nour camp again.”\r\n\r\n“Not likely since he's been recognized,” said Warner, thoughtfully. “But\r\nI don't think General Grant is afraid of anything ahead. That's why he\r\nmade the separation from our own world so complete, and our men are\r\nout cutting down the telegraph lines, so the Johnnies in Jackson can't\r\ncommunicate with their own government either. It's important to us that\r\nwe take Jackson before Pemberton with his army can come up.”\r\n\r\nWarner had estimated the plan correctly. Grant, besides cutting\r\nhimself off from his own superiors at Washington, was also destroying\r\ncommunication between the garrison of Jackson and Pemberton's army of\r\nVicksburg, which was not far away. The two united might beat him, but\r\nhe meant to defeat them separately, and then besiege Vicksburg. It was\r\na complicated plan, depending upon quickness, courage and continued\r\nsuccess. Yet the mind of Grant, though operating afterward on fields of\r\ngreater numbers, was never clearer or more vigorous.\r\n\r\nThey went into camp again after dark, knowing that Jackson was but a\r\nshort distance away, and they expected to attack early in the morning.\r\nDick carried another dispatch to Sherman, who was only a little\r\nmore than two miles from them, and on his way back he joined Colonel\r\nWinchester, who, with Warner, Pennington and a hundred infantry, had\r\ncome out for a scout. The dismounted men were chosen because they wished\r\nto beat up a difficult piece of wooded country.\r\n\r\nThey went directly toward Jackson, advancing very cautiously through the\r\nforest, the mounted officers riding slowly. The night was hot and dark,\r\nmoon and stars obscured by drifting clouds. Pennington, who was an\r\nexpert on weather, announced that another storm was coming.\r\n\r\n“I can feel a dampness in the air,” he said. “I'm willing to risk my\r\nreputation as a prophet and say that the dawn will come with rain.”\r\n\r\n“I hope it won't be a big rain,” said Colonel Winchester, “because if it\r\nis it will surely delay our attack. Our supply of cartridges is small,\r\nand we can't risk wetting them.”\r\n\r\nPennington persisted that a storm was at hand. His father had taught\r\nhim, he said, always to observe the weather signs on the great Nebraska\r\nplains. They were nearly always hoping for rain there, and he had\r\nlearned to smell it before it came. He could smell it now in the same\r\nway here in Mississippi.\r\n\r\nHis opinion did not waver, when the clouds floated away for a while,\r\ndisclosing a faint moon and a few stars. They were now on the banks of a\r\nbrook, flowing through the wood, and Colonel Winchester thought he saw\r\na movement in the forest beyond it. It was altogether likely that so\r\nskillful a leader as Joe Johnston would have out bodies of scouts, and\r\nhe stopped, bidding his men to take cover.\r\n\r\nDick sat on his horse by the colonel's side under the thick boughs of a\r\ngreat tree, and studied the thickets before them. He, too, had noticed\r\na movement, and he was confident that the Southern sharpshooters were\r\nthere. At the command of the colonel all of the officers dismounted,\r\nand orderlies took the horses to the rear. On foot they continued their\r\nexamination of the thickets, and the colonel sent for Sergeant Whitley,\r\nwho confirmed his opinion that the enemy was before them. At his\r\nsuggestion the Union force was spread out, lest it be flanked and\r\nannihilated in the thickets.\r\n\r\nJust as the movement was completed rifles began to crack in front and on\r\nboth flanks, and the piercing yell of the South arose.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to tell the size of the force that assailed them, but\r\nthe Winchester men were veterans now, and they were not afraid. Standing\r\namong the bushes or sheltered by the trees they held their fire until\r\nthey saw dusky figures in the thickets.\r\n\r\nIt had all the aspects of an old Indian battle in the depths of the\r\ngreat forest. Darkness, the ambush and the caution of sharpshooters were\r\nthere. Dick carried a rifle, but he did not use it. He merely watched\r\nthe pink beads of flame among the bushes, while he stayed by the side of\r\nhis colonel and observed the combat.\r\n\r\nIt soon became apparent to him that it would have no definite result.\r\nEach side was merely feeling out its foe that night, and would not force\r\nthe issue. Yet the Southern line approached and some bullets whistled\r\nnear him. He moved a little to one side, and watched for an enemy. It\r\nwas annoying to have bullets come so close, and since they were shooting\r\nat him he might as well shoot at them.\r\n\r\nWhile he was absorbed in watching, the colonel moved in the other\r\ndirection, and Dick stood alone behind a bush. The fire in front had\r\nincreased somewhat, although at no time was it violent. Occasional shots\r\nfrom his own side replied. The clouds that had drifted away were now\r\ndrifting back, and he believed that darkness alone would soon end the\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nThen he saw a bush only a dozen yards in his front move a little, and a\r\nface peered through its branches. There was yet enough light for him\r\nto see that the face was youthful, eager and handsome. It was familiar,\r\ntoo, and then with a shock he remembered. Woodville, the lad with whom\r\nhe had fought such a good fight, nature's weapons used, was before him.\r\n\r\nDick raised his rifle. Young Woodville was an easy target. But the\r\nmotion was only a physical impulse. He knew in his heart that he had\r\nno intention of shooting the young Southerner, and he did not feel the\r\nslightest tinge of remorse because he evaded this part of a soldier's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nYet Woodville, seeing nobody and hearing nothing, would come on. Dick,\r\nholding his rifle in the crook of his left arm, drew a pistol and fired\r\nit over the lad's head. At the same moment he dropped almost flat upon\r\nthe ground. The bullet cut the leaves above Woodville and he sprang\r\nback, startled. A half-dozen Southern skirmishers fired at the flash\r\nof Dick's pistol, but he, too, lying on the ground, heard them cutting\r\nleaves over his head.\r\n\r\nDick saw the face of Woodville disappear from the bush, and then he\r\ncrept away, rejoining Colonel Winchester and his comrades. Five minutes\r\nlater the skirmish ceased by mutual consent, and each band fell back on\r\nits own army, convinced that both were on the watch.\r\n\r\nThey were to advance at four o'clock in the morning, but Pennington's\r\nprediction came true. After midnight, flashes of lightning cut the sky\r\nand the thunder rolled heavily. Then the rain came, not any fugitive\r\nshower, but hard, cold and steady, promising to last many hours.\r\n\r\nIt was still pouring when the advance began before dawn, but Grant's\r\nplans were complete. He had drawn up his forces on the chessboard,\r\nand they were converging closely upon Jackson. They must keep their\r\ncartridges dry and advance at all costs.\r\n\r\nThe Winchesters were in the van in a muddy road. Dick, Warner and\r\nPennington were in the saddle, and they were wet through and through.\r\nThe rain and dusk were so heavy that they could not see fifty feet, and\r\nthey shivered with cold. But their souls were eager and high, and they\r\nwere glad when the army toiled slowly forward to battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. THE LITTLE CAPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\nDick was bent down in his saddle, trying to protect himself a little\r\nfrom the driving rain which beat in his eyes and soaked through his\r\nclothing. Warner and Pennington beside him were in the same condition,\r\nand he saw just before him the bent back of Colonel Winchester, with his\r\nleft arm raised as a shield for his face. Hoofs and wheels made a heavy,\r\nsticky sound as they sank in the mud, and were then pulled out again.\r\n\r\n“Do you see any signs of daylight, Dick?” asked Pennington.\r\n\r\n“Not a sign. I see only a part of our regiment, trees on either side of\r\nus bending before the wind, and rain, and mud, mud everywhere. I'll be\r\nglad when it's over.”\r\n\r\n“So will I,” said Warner. “I wonder what kind of hotels they have in\r\nJackson. I'd like to have a bath, good room and a big breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“The Johnnies are holding breakfast for you,” said Pennington. “Their\r\nfirst course is gunpowder, their second bullets, their third shells and\r\nshrapnel, and their fourth bayonets.”\r\n\r\n“They'll have to serve a lot at every course,” said Dick, “because\r\nGeneral Grant is advancing with fifty thousand men, and so many need a\r\nlot of satisfying.”\r\n\r\nThe storm increased in violence. The rain, falling in a deluge, was\r\ndriven by a wind like a hurricane. The horses strove to turn their heads\r\nfrom it, and confusion arose among the cavalry. The infantry mixed\r\nin the mud swore heavily. Staff officers had the utmost difficulty in\r\nkeeping the regiments together. It was time for the sun, but it did not\r\nappear. Everything was veiled in clouds and driving rain.\r\n\r\nDick looked at his watch, and saw that it was seven o'clock. They had\r\nintended to attack at this hour, but further advance was impossible\r\nfor the time, and, bending their heads, they sought to protect their\r\nammunition. Presently they started again and toiled along slowly and\r\npainfully for more than two hours. Then, just as they saw the enemy\r\nahead of them, the storm seemed to reach the very zenith of its fury.\r\n\r\nDick, in the vanguard, beheld earthworks, cannon and troops before\r\nJackson, but the storm still drove so hard that the Union forces could\r\nnot advance to the assault.\r\n\r\n“This is certainly a most unusual situation,” said Colonel Winchester,\r\nwith an effort at cheerfulness. “Here we are, ready to attack, and the\r\nSoutherners are ready to defend, but a storm holds us both fast in our\r\ntracks. Our duty to protect our cartridges is even greater than our duty\r\nto attack the enemy.”\r\n\r\n“The biggest rain must come to an end,” said Dick.\r\n\r\nBut it was nearly noon before they could advance. Then, as the storm\r\ndecreased rapidly the trumpets sounded the charge, and horse, foot and\r\nartillery, they pressed forward eagerly through the mud.\r\n\r\nThe sun broke through the clouds, and Dick saw before them a wood, a\r\nravine full of thickets, and the road commanded by strong artillery.\r\nThe Northern skirmishers were already stealing forward through the wet\r\nbushes and grass, and soon their rifles were crackling. But the Southern\r\nsharpshooters in the thickets were in stronger force, and their rapid\r\nand accurate fire drove back the Northern men. Then their artillery\r\nopened and swept the road, while the Northern batteries were making\r\nfrantic efforts to get up through the deep, sticky mud.\r\n\r\nBut the trumpets were still calling. The Winchester regiment and others,\r\neager for battle and victory, swept forward. Dick felt once more the\r\nfierce thrill of combat, and, waving his revolver high above his head,\r\nhe shouted with the others as they rushed on. The stream of bullets from\r\nthe ravine thickened, and the cannon were crashing fast. But the Union\r\nmasses did not check their rush for an instant. Although many fell they\r\ncharged into the ravine, driving out the enemy, and pursued him on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nBut the Southern cannon, manned by daring gunners, still held the field\r\nand, aided by the thick mud which held back charging feet, they repulsed\r\nevery attack. The Winchester regiment was forced to cover, and then Dick\r\nheard the booming of cannon in another direction. He knew that Grant and\r\nSherman were coming up there, and he expected they would rush at once\r\ninto Jackson, but it was a long time before the distant thunder came any\r\nnearer.\r\n\r\nJohnston, whose astuteness they feared, was proving himself worthy of\r\ntheir opinion. Knowing that his forces were far too small to defend\r\nJackson, he had sent away the archives of the state and most of the\r\narmy. Only a small force and seventeen cannon were left to fight and\r\ncover his retreat. But so bold and skillful were they that it was far\r\nbeyond noon before Grant and Sherman found that practically nothing was\r\nin front of them.\r\n\r\nBut where Dick and his comrades rode the fighting was severe for a\r\nwhile. Then everything seemed to melt away before them. The fire of the\r\nSouthern cannon ceased suddenly, and Colonel Winchester exclaimed that\r\ntheir works had been abandoned. They charged forward, seized the cannon,\r\nand now rode without resistance into the capital of the state, from\r\nwhich the President of the Confederacy hailed, though by birth a\r\nKentuckian.\r\n\r\nDick and his comrades were among the first to enter the town, and not\r\nuntil then did they know that Johnston and all but a few hundreds of his\r\narmy were gone.\r\n\r\n“We've got the shell only,” Dick said.\r\n\r\n“Still we've struck a blow by taking the capital of the state,” said\r\nColonel Winchester.\r\n\r\nDick looked with much curiosity at the little city into which they were\r\nriding as conquerors. It was too small and new to be imposing. Yet there\r\nwere some handsome houses, standing back on large lawns, and surrounded\r\nby foliage. The doors and shutters of all of them were closed tightly.\r\nDick knew that their owners had gone away or were sitting, hearts full\r\nof bitterness, in their sealed houses.\r\n\r\nThe streets were deep in mud, and at the corners little knots of negroes\r\ngathered and looked at them curiously.\r\n\r\n“They don't seem to welcome us as deliverers,” said Warner.\r\n\r\n“They don't yet know what to think of us,” said Dick. “There's the\r\nCapitol ahead of us, and some of our troops are going into it.”\r\n\r\n“Others have gone into it already,” said Pennington. “Look!”\r\n\r\nThey saw the flag of the Union break out above its dome, the beautiful\r\nstars and stripes, waving gently in the light breeze. A spontaneous\r\ncheer burst from the Union soldiers, and the bitter hearts in the sealed\r\nhouses grew more bitter.\r\n\r\nThe army was now pouring in by every road and Colonel Winchester and his\r\nstaff sought quarters. They were on the verge of exhaustion. All their\r\nclothing was wet and they were discolored with mud. They felt that they\r\nwere bound to have rest and cleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe victorious troops were making their camp, wherever they could find\r\ndry ground, and soon they were building the fires for cooking. But many\r\nof the officers were assigned to the residences, and Colonel Winchester\r\nand his staff were directed by the general to take quarters in a large\r\ncolonial house, standing on a broad lawn, amid the finest magnolias and\r\nlive oaks that Dick had ever seen.\r\n\r\nRemembering an earlier experience during the Shiloh campaign Colonel\r\nWinchester and his young officers approached the house with some\r\nreluctance. In ordinary times it must have been brilliant with life. Two\r\nlittle fountains were playing on either side of the graveled walk that\r\nled to the front door. After the old fashion, three or four marble\r\nstatues stood in the shrubbery. Everything indicated wealth. Probably\r\nthe town house of a great planter, reflected Dick. In Mississippi a man\r\nsometimes owned as many as a thousand slaves, and lived like a prince.\r\n\r\nThe house offered them no welcome. Its doors and windows were closed,\r\nbut Dick had seen thin smoke rising from a chimney in the rear. He\r\nexpected that they would have to force the door, but at the first knock\r\nit was thrown open by a tall, thin woman of middle years. The look she\r\ngave them was full of bitter hatred--Dick sometimes thought that\r\nwomen could hate better than men--but her manner and bearing showed\r\ndistinction. He, as well as his comrades, took her to be the lady of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n“We ask your pardon, madame, for this intrusion,” said Colonel\r\nWinchester, “but we are compelled to occupy your house a while. We\r\npromise you as little trouble as possible.”\r\n\r\n“We ask no consideration of any kind from men who have come to despoil\r\nour country and ruin its people,” she said icily.\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester flushed.\r\n\r\n“But madame,” he protested, “we do not come to destroy.”\r\n\r\n“I do not care to argue with you about it,” she said in the same lofty\r\ntone, “and also you need not address me as madame. I am Miss Woodville.”\r\n\r\nDick started.\r\n\r\n“Does this house belong to Colonel John Woodville?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“It does not,” she replied crisply, “but it belongs to his elder\r\nbrother, Charles Woodville, who is also a colonel, and who is my father.\r\nWhat do you know of Colonel John Woodville?”\r\n\r\n“I met his son once,” replied Dick briefly.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him sharply. Dick thought for a moment that he saw alarm\r\nin her look, but he concluded that it was only anger.\r\n\r\nThey stood confronting each other, the little group of officers and the\r\nwoman, and Colonel Winchester, embarrassed, but knowing that he must do\r\nsomething, went forward and pushed back a door opening into the hall.\r\nDick automatically followed him, and then stepped back, startled.\r\n\r\nA roar like that of a lion met them. An old man, with a high, bald and\r\nextremely red forehead lay in a huge bed by a window. It was a great\r\nhead, and eyes, set deep, blazed under thick, white lashes. His body was\r\ncovered to the chin.\r\n\r\nDick saw that the man's anger was that of the caged wild beast, and\r\nthere was something splendid and terrible about it.\r\n\r\n“You infernal Yankees!” he cried, and his voice again rumbled like that\r\nof a lion.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Charles Woodville, I presume?” said Colonel Winchester\r\npolitely.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Colonel Charles Woodville,” thundered the man, “fastened here\r\nin bed by a bullet from one of your cursed vessels in the Mississippi,\r\nwhile you rob and destroy!”\r\n\r\nAnd then he began to curse. He drew one hand from under the cover and\r\nshook his clenched fist at them in a kind of rhythmic beat while the\r\noaths poured forth. To Dick it was not common swearing. There was\r\nnothing coarse and vulgar about it. It was denunciation, malediction,\r\nfulmination, anathema. It had a certain majesty and dignity. Its\r\nrichness and variety were unequaled, and it was hurled forth by a voice\r\ndeep, powerful and enduring.\r\n\r\nDick listened with amazement and then admiration. He had never heard its\r\nlike, nor did he feel any offense. The daughter, too, stood by,\r\npursing her prim lips, and evidently approving. Colonel Winchester was\r\nmotionless like a statue, while the infuriated man shook his fist at him\r\nand launched imprecations. But his face had turned white and Dick saw\r\nthat he was fiercely angry.\r\n\r\nWhen the old man ceased at last from exhaustion Colonel Winchester said\r\nquietly:\r\n\r\n“If you had spoken to me in the proper manner we might have gone away\r\nand found quarters elsewhere. But we intend to stay here and we will\r\nrepay your abuse with good manners.”\r\n\r\nDick saw the daughter flush, but the old man said:\r\n\r\n“Then it will be the first time that good manners were ever brought from\r\nthe country north of the Mason and Dixon line.”\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester flushed in his turn, but made no direct reply.\r\n\r\n“If you will assign us rooms, Miss Woodville,” he said, “we will go\r\nto them, otherwise we'll find them for ourselves, which may be less\r\nconvenient for you. I repeat that we desire to give you as little\r\ntrouble as possible.”\r\n\r\n“Do so, Margaret,” interrupted Colonel Woodville, “because then I may\r\nget rid of them all the sooner.”\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester bowed and turned toward the door. Miss Woodville,\r\nobedient to the command of her father, led the way. Dick was the last to\r\ngo out, and he said to the old lion who lay wounded in the bed:\r\n\r\n“Colonel Woodville, I've met your nephew, Victor.”\r\n\r\nHe did not notice that the old man whitened and that the hand now lying\r\nupon the cover clenched suddenly.\r\n\r\n“You have?” growled Colonel Woodville, “and how does it happen that you\r\nand my nephew have anything in common?”\r\n\r\n“I could scarcely put it that way,” replied Dick, refusing to be\r\nangered, “unless you call an encounter with fists something in common.\r\nHe and I had a great fight at his father's plantation of Bellevue.”\r\n\r\n“He might have been in a better business, taking part in a common brawl\r\nwith a common Yankee.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir, while I may be common, I'm not a Yankee. I was born and grew\r\nup south of the Ohio River in Kentucky.”\r\n\r\n“Then you're a traitor. All you Kentuckians ought to be fighting with\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“Difference of opinion, but I hope your nephew is well.”\r\n\r\nThe deep eyes under the thick white thatch glared in a manner that Dick\r\nconsidered wholly unnecessary. But Colonel Woodville made no reply,\r\nmerely turning his face to the wall as if he were weary.\r\n\r\nDick hurried into the hall, closing the door gently behind him. The\r\nothers, not missing him, were already some yards away, and he quickly\r\nrejoined Pennington and Warner. The younger men would have been glad\r\nto leave the house, but Colonel Winchester's blood was up, and he was\r\nresolved to stay. The little party was eight in number, and they were\r\nsoon quartered in four rooms on the lower floor. Miss Woodville promptly\r\ndisappeared, and one of the camp cooks arrived with supplies, which he\r\ntook to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nDick and Warner were in one of the rooms, and, removing their belts\r\nand coats, they made themselves easy. It was a large bedroom with high\r\nceilings and wicker furniture. There were several good paintings on the\r\nwalls and a bookcase contained Walter Scott's novels and many of the\r\neighteenth century classics.\r\n\r\n“I think this must have been a guest chamber,” said Dick, “but for us\r\ncoming from the rain and mud it's a real palace.”\r\n\r\n“Then it's fulfilling its true function,” said Warner, “because it has\r\nguests now. What a strange household! Did you ever see such a peppery\r\npair as that swearing old colonel and his acid daughter?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know that I blame them. I think, sometimes, George, that\r\nyou New Englanders are the most selfish of people. You're too truly\r\nrighteous. You're always denouncing the faults of others, but you never\r\nsee any of your own. Away back in the Revolution when Boston called,\r\nthe Southern provinces came to her help, but Boston and New England have\r\nspent a large part of their time since then denouncing the South.”\r\n\r\n“What's struck you, Dick? Are you weakening in the good cause?”\r\n\r\n“Not for a moment. But suppose Mississippi troops walked into your\r\nown father's house in Vermont, and, as conquerors, demanded food and\r\nshelter! Would you rejoice over them, and ask them why they hadn't come\r\nsooner?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose not, Dick. But, stop it, and come back to your normal\r\ntemperature. I won't quarrel with you.”\r\n\r\n“I won't give you a chance, George. I'm through. But remember that while\r\nI'm red hot for the Union, I was born south of the Ohio River myself,\r\nand I have lots of sympathy for the people against whom I'm fighting.”\r\n\r\n“For the matter of that, so've I, Dick, and I was born north of the\r\nOhio River. But I'm getting tremendously hungry. I hope that cook will\r\nhurry.”\r\n\r\nThey were called soon, and eight officers sat at the table. The cook\r\nhimself served them. Miss Woodville had vanished, and not a servant was\r\nvisible about the great house. Despite their hunger and the good quality\r\nof the food the group felt constraint. The feeling that they were\r\nintruders, in a sense brigands, was forced upon them. Dick was sure\r\nthat the old man with the great bald head was swearing fiercely and\r\nincessantly under his breath.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room was a large and splendid apartment, and the silver still\r\nlay upon the great mahogany sideboard. The little city, now the camp\r\nof an overwhelming army, had settled into silence, and the twilight was\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nWith the chill of unwelcome still upon them the officers said little.\r\nAs the twilight deepened Warner lighted several candles. The silver\r\nglittered under the flame. Colonel Winchester presently ordered the cook\r\nto take a plate of the most delicate food to Colonel Woodville.\r\n\r\nAs the cook withdrew on his mission he left open the door of the\r\ndining-room and they heard the sound of a voice, uplifted in a\r\nthunderous roar. The cook hurried back, the untouched plate in his hand\r\nand his face a little pale.\r\n\r\n“He cursed me, sir,” he said to Colonel Winchester. “I was never cursed\r\nso before by anybody. He said he would not touch the food. He was sure\r\nthat it had been poisoned by the Yankees, and even if it were not he'd\r\nrather die than accept anything from their hands.”\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester laughed rather awkwardly.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, we've tendered our good offices,” he said. “I suppose his\r\ndaughter will attend to his wants, and we'll not expose ourselves to\r\nfurther insults.”\r\n\r\nBut the refusal had affected the spirits of them all, and as soon as\r\ntheir hunger was satisfied they withdrew. The soldier who had acted as\r\ncook was directed to put the dining-room back in order and then he might\r\nsleep in a room near the kitchen.\r\n\r\nDick and Warner returned to their own apartment. Neither had much to\r\nsay, and Warner, lying down on the bed, was soon fast asleep. Dick\r\nsat by the window. The town was now almost lost in the obscurity. The\r\nexhausted army slept, and the occasional glitter from the bayonet of a\r\nsentinel was almost the only thing that told of its presence.\r\n\r\nDick was troubled. In spite of will and reason, his conscience hurt\r\nhim. Theory was beautiful, but it was often shivered by practice. His\r\nsympathies were strongly with the old colonel who had cursed him so\r\nviolently and the grim old maid who had given them only harsh words.\r\nBesides, he had pleasant memories of Victor Woodville, and these were\r\nhis uncle and cousin.\r\n\r\nHe sat for a long time at the window. The house was absolutely quiet,\r\nand he was sure that everybody was asleep. There could be no doubt about\r\nWarner, because he slumbered audibly. But Dick was still wide awake.\r\nThere was some tension of mind or muscle that kept sleep far from him.\r\nSo he remained at the window, casting up the events of the day and those\r\nthat might come.\r\n\r\nThe evening was well advanced when he was quite sure that he heard a\r\nlight step in the hall. He would have paid little attention to it at an\r\nordinary time, but, in all that silence and desolation, it called\r\nhim like a drum-beat. Only a light step, and yet it filled him with\r\nsuspicion and alarm. He was in the heart of a great and victorious\r\nUnion army, but at the moment he felt that anything could happen in this\r\nstrange house.\r\n\r\nSlipping his pistol from his belt, he opened the door on noiseless\r\nhinges and stepped into the hall. A figure was disappearing in its dim\r\nspace, but, as he saw clearly, it was that of a woman. He was sure that\r\nit was Miss Woodville and he stepped forward. He had no intention\r\nof following her, but his foot creaked on the floor, and, stopping\r\ninstantly, she faced about. Then he saw that she carried a tray of food.\r\n\r\n“Are we to have our house occupied and to be spied upon also?” she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nDick flushed. Few people had ever spoken to him in such a manner, and it\r\nwas hard to remember that she was a woman.\r\n\r\n“I heard a footstep in the hall, and it was my duty to see who was\r\npassing,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I have prepared food and I am taking it to my father. He would not\r\naccept it from Yankee hands.”\r\n\r\n“Colonel Woodville sups late. I should think a wounded man would be\r\nasleep at this hour, if he could.”\r\n\r\nShe gave him a glance full of venom.\r\n\r\n“What does it matter?” she said.\r\n\r\nDick refused to be insulted.\r\n\r\n“Let me take the tray for you,” he said, “at least to the door. Your\r\nfather need not know that my hands have touched it.”\r\n\r\nShe shrank back and her eyes blazed.\r\n\r\n“Let us alone!” she exclaimed. “Go back to your room! Isn't it\r\nsufficient that this house shelters you?”\r\n\r\nShe seemed to Dick to show a heat and hate out of all proportion to the\r\noccasion, but he did not repeat the offer.\r\n\r\n“I meant well,” he said, “but, since you do not care for my help, I'll\r\nreturn to my room and go to sleep. Believe me, I'm sincere when I say I\r\nhope your father will recover quickly from his wound.”\r\n\r\n“He will,” she replied briefly.\r\n\r\nDick bowed with politeness and turned toward his own room. Nevertheless\r\nhis curiosity did not keep him from standing a moment or two in the dark\r\nagainst the wall and looking back at the woman who bore the tray.\r\nHe drew a long breath of astonishment when he saw her pass Colonel\r\nWoodville's door, and hurry forward now with footsteps that made no\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion which had lain deep in his mind sprang at once into life.\r\nKeeping close to the wall, he followed swiftly and saw her disappear up\r\na stairway. There he let the pursuit end and returned thoughtfully to\r\nhis room.\r\n\r\nDick was much troubled. An ethical question had presented itself to him.\r\nHe believed that he had divined everything. The solution had come to him\r\nwith such suddenness and force that he was as fully convinced as if he\r\nhad seen with his own eyes. Military duty demanded that he invade the\r\nsecond floor of the Woodville house. But there were feelings of humanity\r\nand mercy, moral issues not less powerful than military duty, and maybe\r\nmore so.\r\n\r\nHe was pulled back and forth with great mental violence. He was sorry\r\nthat he had seen Miss Woodville with the tray. And then he wasn't.\r\nNevertheless, he stayed in his own room, and Warner, waking for a\r\nmoment, regarded him with wonder as he sat outlined against the window\r\nwhich they had left unshuttered and opened to admit air.\r\n\r\n“What's the matter, Dick? Have you got a fever?” he asked. “Why haven't\r\nyou gone to bed?”\r\n\r\n“I'm going to do so right away. Don't bother yourself about me, George.\r\nMy nerves have been strained pretty hard, and I had to wait until they\r\nwere quiet until I could go to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“Don't have nerves,” said Warner, as he turned back on his side and\r\nreturned to slumber.\r\n\r\nDick undressed and got into bed. It was the first time in many nights\r\nthat he had not slept in his clothes, and beds had been unknown for many\r\nweeks. It was a luxury so penetrating and powerful that it affected\r\nhim like an opiate. Such questions as military and moral duty floated\r\nswiftly away, and he slept the sleep of youth and a good heart.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was almost a repetition of supper. The army cook prepared and\r\nserved it, and the Woodvilles remained invisible. Colonel Winchester\r\ninformed the young officers that they would remain in Jackson two or\r\nthree days, and then great events might be expected. All felt sure\r\nthat he was predicting aright. Pemberton must be approaching with the\r\nVicksburg army. The wary and skillful Johnston had another army, and he\r\ncould not be far away. Moreover, this was the heart of the Confederacy\r\nand other unknown forces might be gathering.\r\n\r\nThey felt the greatness of the hour, Grant's daring stroke, and the\r\npossibility that he might yet be surrounded and overwhelmed. Their minds\r\nwere attuned, too, to other and yet mightier deeds, but they were glad,\r\nnevertheless, of a little rest. The Woodville house was a splendid\r\nplace, and in the morning they did not feel so much the chill of\r\nembarrassment that had been created for them the night before.\r\n\r\nDick went straight to the room of Colonel Woodville, opened the door\r\nwithout knocking, and closed it behind him quickly but noiselessly.\r\n\r\nThe colonel was propped up in his bed and a tray bearing light and\r\ndelicate food lay on a chair. His daughter stood beside the bed,\r\nspeechless with anger at this intrusion. Dick lifted his hand, and the\r\nlook upon his face checked one of the mightiest oaths that had ever\r\nwelled up from the throat of Colonel Charles Woodville, king of\r\nswearers.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” said Dick in a voice not loud, but sharp with command.\r\n\r\n“Can't we at least have privacy in the room of an old and wounded man?”\r\n asked Miss Woodville.\r\n\r\n“You can hereafter,” replied Dick quietly. “I shall not come again, but\r\nI tell you now to get him out of the house to-night, unless he's too\r\nbadly hurt to be moved.”\r\n\r\n“Why should my father be taken away?” demanded Miss Woodville.\r\n\r\n“I'm not speaking of your father.”\r\n\r\n“Of whom, then?”\r\n\r\nDick did not answer, but he met her gaze steadily, and her face fell.\r\nThen he turned, walked out of the room without a word, and again closed\r\nthe door behind him. When he went out on the piazza he saw excitement\r\namong his comrades. The moment for great action was coming even sooner\r\nthan Colonel Winchester had expected.\r\n\r\n“Johnston is communicating with Pemberton,” said Warner, “and he has\r\nordered Pemberton to unite with him. Then they will attack us. He sent\r\nthe same order by three messengers, but one of them was in reality a\r\nspy of ours, and he came straight to General Grant with it. We're\r\nforewarned, and the trap can't shut down on us, because General Grant\r\nmeans to go at once for Pemberton.”\r\n\r\nDick understood the situation, which was both critical and thrilling.\r\nGrant was still in the heart of the Confederacy, and its forces were\r\nconverging fast upon him. But the grim and silent man, instead of merely\r\ntrying to escape, intended to strike a blow that would make escape\r\nunnecessary. All the young officers saw the plan and their hearts\r\nleaped.\r\n\r\nDick, in the excitement of the day, forgot about the Woodville house\r\nand its inmates. Troops were already marching out of Jackson to meet the\r\nenemy, but the Winchester regiment would not leave until early the next\r\nmorning. They were to spend a second night, or at least a part of it, in\r\nColonel Woodville's house.\r\n\r\nIt was the same group that ate supper there and the same army cook\r\nserved them. They did not go to the bedrooms afterward, but strolled\r\nabout, belted, expecting to receive the marching call at any moment.\r\n\r\nDick went into the library, where a single candle burned, and while he\r\nwas there Miss Woodville appeared at the door and beckoned to him. She\r\nhad abated her severity of manner so much that he was astonished, but he\r\nfollowed without a word.\r\n\r\nShe saw that the hall was clear and then she led quickly into her\r\nfather's room. Colonel Woodville was propped up against the pillows, and\r\nthere was color in his face.\r\n\r\n“Young man,” he said, “come here. You can afford to obey me, although\r\nI'm a prisoner, because I'm so much older than you are. You have a heart\r\nand breeding, young sir, and I wish to shake your hand.”\r\n\r\nHe thrust a large hand from the cover, and Dick shook it warmly.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't have shaken it if you had been born north of the Ohio\r\nRiver,” said Colonel Woodville.\r\n\r\nDick laughed.\r\n\r\n“My chief purpose in having you brought here,” said Colonel Woodville,\r\n“was to relate to you an incident, of which I heard once. Did I read\r\nabout it, or was it told to me, Margaret?”\r\n\r\n“I think, sir, that some one told you of it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, it doesn't matter. A few words will tell it. In an old,\r\nforgotten war a young soldier quartered in the house of his defeated\r\nenemy--but defeated only for the time, remember--saw something which\r\nmade him believe that a wounded nephew of the house was hid in an upper\r\nroom. But he was generous and he did not search further. The second\r\nnight, while the young officer and his comrades were at supper, the\r\nnephew, who was not hurt badly, was slipped out of the house and escaped\r\nfrom the city in the darkness. It's not apropos of anything, and I don't\r\nknow why I'm relating it to you, but I suppose this terrible war we are\r\nfighting is responsible for an old man's whim.”\r\n\r\n“I've found it very interesting, sir,” said Dick, “and I think it's\r\nrelevant, because it shows that even in war men may remain Christian\r\nhuman beings.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you're right, and I trust, young sir, that you will not be\r\nkilled in this defeat to which you are surely marching.”\r\n\r\nDick bowed to both, and left them to their fears and hopes. The glow was\r\nstill about his heart when he rode forth with the Winchester regiment\r\nafter midnight. But, owing to the need of horses for the regular\r\ncavalry, it had become an infantry regiment once more. Only the officers\r\nrode.\r\n\r\nAt dawn they were with Grant approaching a ridge called Champion Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. CHAMPION HILL\r\n\r\n\r\nDick on that momentous morning did not appreciate the full magnitude of\r\nthe event about to occur, nor did he until long afterward. He knew\r\nit was of high importance, and yet it might have ranked as one of the\r\ndecisive battles of history. There were no such numbers as at Shiloh and\r\nChancellorsville, but the results were infinitely greater.\r\n\r\nNor was it likely that such thoughts would float through the head of a\r\nlad who had ridden far, and who at dawn was looking for an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe scouts had already brought word that the Southerners were in strong\r\nforce, and that they occupied Champion Hill, the crest of which was\r\nbare, but with sides dark with forests and thickets. They were riding at\r\npresent through forests themselves, and they felt that their ignorance\r\nof the country might take them at any moment into an ambush.\r\n\r\n“We know what army we're going against, don't we?” asked Pennington.\r\n\r\n“Why, Pemberton's, of course,” replied Dick.\r\n\r\n“I'm glad of that. I'd rather fight him than Joe Johnston.”\r\n\r\n“They've been trying to unite, but we hear they haven't succeeded.”\r\n\r\nPemberton, in truth, had been suffering from the most painful doubt.\r\nHaving failed to do what Johnston had expected of him, he had got\r\nhimself into a more dangerous position than ever. Then, after listening\r\nto a divided council of his generals, he had undertaken a movement which\r\nbrought him within striking distance of Grant, while Johnston was yet\r\ntoo far away to help him.\r\n\r\nDick did not know how much fortune was favoring the daring that morning,\r\nbut he and his comrades were sanguine. They felt all the time the\r\nstrong hand over them. Like the soldiers, they had acquired the utmost\r\nconfidence in Grant. He might make mistakes, but he would not doubt and\r\nhesitate and draw back. Where he led the enemy could not win anything\r\nwithout having to fight hard for it.\r\n\r\nThe early summer dawn had deepened, bright and hot, and the sun was now\r\nclear of the trees, turning the green of the forests to gold. Coffee and\r\nwarm food were served to them during a momentary stop among the trees,\r\nand then the Winchester regiment moved forward again toward Champion\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nRifle shots were now heard ahead of them. They were scattered, but the\r\nlads knew that the hostile skirmishers had come in contact. Presently\r\nthe reports increased and through the woods they saw puffs of smoke.\r\nTrumpets to right and left were calling up the brigades.\r\n\r\n“Open up for the guns!” cried an aide, and a battery lumbered through,\r\nthe men swearing at their panting horses. But the Southern cannon were\r\nalready at work. From the bare crest of Champion Hill they were sending\r\nshells which crashed in the ranks of the advancing foe. Two or three\r\nof the Winchesters were hit, and a wounded horse, losing its rider, ran\r\nscreaming through the wood.\r\n\r\nThe forest and thickets now grew so dense that the officers dismounted,\r\ngiving their horses to an orderly, and led on foot. The country before\r\nthem was most difficult. Besides the trees and brush it was seared with\r\nravines. A swarm of skirmishers in front whom they could not see now\r\npoured bullets among them, and the shells, curving over the heads of\r\nthe ambushed sharpshooters, fell in the Union ranks. On either flank the\r\nbattle opened and swelled rapidly.\r\n\r\n“We may have got Pemberton trapped,” said Pennington, “but he's got so\r\nmany bristles that we can't reach in a hand and pull out our captive. My\r\nGod, Dick, are you killed?”\r\n\r\nHe was pulling Dick to his feet and examining him anxiously.\r\n\r\n“I'm all right,” said Dick in a moment. “It was the wind of a big round\r\nshot that knocked me down. Just now I'm thanking God it was the wind and\r\nnot the shot.”\r\n\r\n“I wish we could get through these thickets!” exclaimed Warner. “Our\r\ncomrades must be engaged much more heavily than we are. What an uproar!”\r\n\r\nThe combat swelled to great proportions. The Southern army, being\r\ncompelled to fight, fought now with all its might. The crest of the long\r\nhill blazed with fire. The men in gray used every advantage of position.\r\nCannon and rifles raked the woods and thickets, and at many points the\r\nUnion attack was driven back. The sun rose slowly and they still held\r\nthe hill, fighting with all the fire and valor characteristic of the\r\nSouth. They were cheered at times by the expectation of victory, but the\r\nstubborn Grant brought up his remaining forces and continually pressed\r\nthe battle.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment crossed a ravine and knelt among the thickets.\r\nIts losses had not yet been heavy, as most of the cannon fire was\r\npassing over their heads. Grape and canister were whistling among the\r\nwoods, and Dick was devoutly grateful that these deadly missiles were\r\ngoing so high. Yet if they did not hurt they made one shiver, and it\r\nwas not worth while to recall that when he heard the sound the shot had\r\npassed already. One shivered anyhow.\r\n\r\nAs well as Dick could judge from the volume of sound the battle seemed\r\nto be concentrated directly upon the hill. He knew that Grant expected\r\nto make a general attack in full force, and he surmised that one of the\r\ncommanders under him was not pushing forward with the expected zeal. His\r\nsurmise was correct. A general with fifteen thousand men was standing\r\nalmost passive in front of a much smaller force, but other generals were\r\nshowing great fire and energy.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment contained many excellent riflemen and they were\r\nso close now that they could use the weapons for which the Kentuckians\r\nwere famous. Firing deliberately, they began to cut gaps in the first\r\nranks of the defenders on the slope. Then they rose and with other\r\nregiments pushed forward again.\r\n\r\nBut they came to a road in the side of the hill defended powerfully by\r\ninfantry and artillery, and a heavy fire, killing and wounding many, was\r\npoured upon them. They sought to cross the road and attack the defenders\r\nwith the bayonet, but they were driven back and their losses were so\r\nheavy that they were compelled to take cover in the nearest thickets.\r\n\r\nThe men, gasping with heat and exhaustion, threw themselves down, a\r\nsleet of shells and bullets passing over their heads. Dick had a sense\r\nof failure, but it lasted only a moment or two. From both left and right\r\ncame the fierce crash of battle, and he knew that, if they had been\r\ndriven back before the road, their comrades were maintaining the combat\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n“It's merely a delay. We pause to make a stronger attack,” said Colonel\r\nWinchester, as if he were apologizing to himself. “Are you all right,\r\nDick?”\r\n\r\n“Unhurt, sir, and so are Warner and Pennington, who are lying here\r\nbeside me.”\r\n\r\n“Unhurt, but uneasy,” said Warner. “I don't like the way twigs and\r\nleaves are raining down on me. It shows that if they were to depress\r\ntheir fire they would be shearing limbs off of us instead of boughs off\r\nthe trees.”\r\n\r\nThe sun was high and brilliant now, but it could not dispel the clouds\r\nof smoke gathering in the thickets. It floated everywhere, and Dick felt\r\nit stinging his mouth and throat. Murmurs began to run along the lines.\r\nThey did not like being held there. They wanted to charge again. They\r\nwere still confident of victory.\r\n\r\nDick was sent toward another part of the army for orders, and he saw\r\nthat all along the hill the battle was raging fiercely. But Grant could\r\nnot yet hear the roar of guns which should indicate the advance of\r\nMcClernand and his fifteen thousand. The silent leader was filled with\r\nanger, but he reserved the expression of it for a later time.\r\n\r\nDick saw the fiery and impetuous Logan, noticeable for his long\r\ncoal-black hair, lead a headlong and successful charge, which carried\r\nthe Union troops higher up the hill. But another general was driven\r\nback, losing cannon, although he retook them in a second and desperate\r\ncharge. Still no news from McClernand and his fifteen thousand! There\r\nwas silence where his guns ought to have been thundering, and Grant\r\nburned with silent anger.\r\n\r\nIt was noon, and a half-hour past. The Union plans, made with so much\r\ncare and judgment, and the movements begun with so much skill and\r\ndaring seemed to be going awry. Yet Grant with the tenacity, rather\r\nthan lightning intuition, that made him a great general, held on. His\r\nlieutenants clung to their ground and prepared anew for attack.\r\n\r\nDick hurried back to his own regiment, which was still lying in the\r\nthickets, bearing an order for its advance in full strength. Colonel\r\nWinchester, who was standing erect, walking among his men and\r\nencouraging them, received it with joy. Word was speedily passed to all\r\nthat the time to win or lose had come. Above the cannon and rifles the\r\nmusic of the calling trumpets sounded. The fire of both sides suddenly\r\ndoubled and tripled in volume.\r\n\r\n“Now, boys,” shouted Colonel Winchester, waving his sword, “up the hill\r\nand beat 'em!”\r\n\r\nUttering a deep-throated roar the Winchesters rushed forward, firing\r\nas they charged. Dick was carried on the top wave of enthusiasm. He\r\ndischarged his pistol into the bank of fire and smoke in front of them\r\nand shouted incessantly. He heard the bullets and every form of missile\r\nfrom the cannon whining all about them. Leaves and twigs fell upon him.\r\nMany men went down under the deadly fire, but the rush of the regiment\r\nwas not checked for an instant.\r\n\r\nThey passed out of the thicket, swept across the road, and drove the\r\ndefenders up the hill. Along the whole line the Union army, fired with\r\nthe prospect of success, rushed to the attack. Grant threw every man\r\npossible into the charge.\r\n\r\nThe Southern army was borne back by the weight of its enemy. All of the\r\nfront lines were driven in and the divisions were cut apart. There\r\nwas lack of coordination among the generals, who were often unable to\r\ncommunicate with one another, and Pemberton gave the order to retreat.\r\nThe battle was lost to the South, and with it the chance to crush Grant\r\nbetween two forces.\r\n\r\nThe Union army uttered a great shout of victory, and Grant urged forward\r\nthe pursuit. Bowen, one of the South's bravest generals, was the last to\r\ngive way. The Winchester regiment was a part of the force that followed\r\nhim, both fighting hard. Dick found himself with his comrades, wading\r\na creek, and they plunged into the woods and thickets which blazed with\r\nthe fire of South and North. A Confederate general was killed here, but\r\nthe brave Bowen still kept his division in order, and made the pursuit\r\npay a heavy cost for all its gain.\r\n\r\nDick saw besides the Confederate column many irregulars in the woods,\r\nskilled sharpshooters, who began to sting them on the flank and bring\r\ndown many a good soldier. He caught a glimpse of a man who was urging\r\non the riflemen and who seemed to be their leader. He recognized Slade,\r\nand, without a moment's hesitation, fired at him with his pistol. But\r\nthe man was unhurt and Slade's return bullet clipped a lock of Dick's\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nThen they lost each other in the smoke and turmoil of the battle, and,\r\ndespite the energy of the pursuit by the Union leaders, they could not\r\nbreak up the command of Bowen. The valiant Southerner not only made good\r\nhis retreat, but broke down behind him the bridge over a deep river,\r\nthus saving for a time the fragments of Pemberton's army.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment marched back to the battlefield, and Dick saw\r\nthat the victory had been overwhelming. Nearly a third of the Southern\r\narmy had been lost and thirty cannon were the trophies of Grant. Yet the\r\nfighting had been desperate. The dead and wounded were so numerous that\r\nthe veteran soldiers who had been at Shiloh and Stone River called it\r\n“The Hill of Death.”\r\n\r\nDick saw Grant walking over the field and he wondered what his feelings\r\nwere. Although its full result was beyond him he knew, nevertheless,\r\nthat Champion Hill was a great victory. At one stroke of his sword Grant\r\nhad cut apart the circle of his foes.\r\n\r\nDick came back from the pursuit with Colonel Winchester. He had lost\r\nsight of Warner and Pennington in the turmoil, but he believed that they\r\nwould reappear unhurt. They had passed through so many battles now that\r\nit did not occur to him that any of the three would be killed. They\r\nmight be wounded, of course, as they had been already, but fate would\r\nplay them no such scurvy trick as to slay them.\r\n\r\n“What will be the next step, Colonel?” asked Dick, as they stood\r\ntogether upon the victorious hill.\r\n\r\n“Depends upon what Johnston and Pemberton do. Pemberton, I'm sure, will\r\nretreat to Vicksburg, but Johnston, if he can prevent it, won't let his\r\narmy be shut up there. Still, they may not be able to communicate, and\r\nif they should Pemberton may disobey the far abler Johnston and stay in\r\nVicksburg anyhow. At any rate, I think we're sure to march at once on\r\nVicksburg.”\r\n\r\nA figure approaching in the dusk greeted Dick with a shout of delight.\r\nAnother just behind repeated the shout with equal fervor. Warner and\r\nPennington had come, unharmed as he had expected, and they were exultant\r\nover the victory.\r\n\r\n“Come over here,” said Warner to Dick. “Sergeant Whitley has cooked a\r\nglorious supper and we're waiting for you.”\r\n\r\nDick joined them eagerly, and the sergeant received them with his\r\nbenevolent smile. They were commissioned officers, and he gave them all\r\nthe respect due to rank, but in his mind they were only his boys, whom\r\nhe must watch and protect.\r\n\r\nWhile the fires sprang up about them and they ate and talked of the\r\nvictory, Washington was knowing its darkest moments. Lee had already\r\nbeen marching thirteen days toward Gettysburg, and he seemed unbeatable.\r\nGrant, who had won for the North about all the real success of which\r\nit could yet boast, was lost somewhere in the Southern wilderness. The\r\nmessages seeking him ran to the end of the telegraph wires and no answer\r\ncame back. The click of the key could not reach him. Many a spirit, bold\r\nat most times, despaired of the Union.\r\n\r\nBut the old and hackneyed saying about the darkest hour just before the\r\ndawn was never more true. The flame of success was already lighted in\r\nthe far South, and Lincoln was soon to receive the message, telling him\r\nthat Grant had not disappeared in the wilderness for nothing. Thereafter\r\nhe was to trust the silent and tenacious general through everything.\r\n\r\nThey were up and away at dawn. Dick was glad enough to leave the hill,\r\non which many of the dead yet lay unburied, and he was eager for the new\r\nfield of conflict, which he was sure would be before Vicksburg. Warner\r\nand Pennington were as sanguine as he. Grant was now inspiring in them\r\nthe confidence that Lee and Jackson inspired in their young officers.\r\n\r\n“How big is this city of Vicksburg?” asked Pennington.\r\n\r\n“Not big at all,” replied Warner. “There are no big cities in the South\r\nexcept New Orleans, but it's big as a fortress. It's surrounded by\r\nearthworks, Frank, from which the Johnnies can pot you any time.”\r\n\r\n“Well, at any rate, I'll be glad to see it--from a safe distance. I\r\nwouldn't mind sitting down before a town. There's too much wet country\r\naround here to suit me.”\r\n\r\n“It's likely that you'll have a chance to sit for a long time. We won't\r\ntake Vicksburg easily.”\r\n\r\nBut the time for sitting down had not yet come. The confidence of the\r\nsoldiers in their leader was justified continually. He advanced rapidly\r\ntoward Vicksburg, and in pursuit of Pemberton's defeated men. The\r\nvictory at Champion Hill had been so complete that the Southern army\r\nwas broken into detached fragments, and the Southern generals were now\r\nhaving the greatest difficulty in getting them together again.\r\n\r\nGrant, with his loyal subordinate, Sherman, continued to push upon the\r\nenemy with the greatest vigor. Sherman had not believed in the success\r\nof the campaign, had even filed his written protest, but when Grant\r\ninsisted he had cooperated with skill and energy. He and Grant stood\r\ntogether on a hill looking toward the future field of conflict, and he\r\ntold Grant now that he expected continued success.\r\n\r\nIt was the fortune of the young officers of the Winchester regiment\r\nsitting near on their horses to see the two generals who were in such\r\nearnest consultation, and who examined the whole circle of the country\r\nso long and so carefully through powerful glasses.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the victory deep in the South were growing hourly in\r\nDick's mind, and the two figures standing there on the hill were full\r\nof significance to him. He had a premonition that they were the men more\r\nthan any others who would achieve the success of the Union, if it were\r\nachieved at all. They had dismounted and stood side by side, the figure\r\nof Grant short, thick and sturdy, that of Sherman, taller and more\r\nslender. They spoke only at intervals, and few words then, but nothing\r\nin the country about them escaped their attention.\r\n\r\nDick had glasses of his own, and he, too, began to look. He saw a region\r\nmuch wooded and cut by deep streams. Before them lay the sluggish waters\r\nof Chickasaw Bayou, where Sherman had sustained a severe defeat at an\r\nearlier time, and farther away flowed the deep, muddy Yazoo.\r\n\r\n“See the smoke, George, rising above that line of trees along the\r\nriver?” said Dick.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Dick,” replied Warner, “and I notice that the smoke rises in\r\npuffs.”\r\n\r\n“It has a right to go up that way, because it's expelled violently from\r\nthe smoke-stacks of steamers. And those steamers are ours, George, our\r\nwarships. Our navy in this war hasn't much chance to do the spectacular,\r\nbut we can never give it enough credit.”\r\n\r\n“That's right, Dick. It keeps the enemy surrounded and cuts off his\r\nsupplies, while our army fights him on land. Whatever happens the waters\r\nare ours.”\r\n\r\n“And the Mississippi has become a Union river, splitting apart the\r\nConfederacy.”\r\n\r\n“Right you are, Dick, and we're already in touch with our fleet there.\r\nThe boats do more than fight for us. They're unloading supplies in vast\r\nquantities from Chickasaw Bayou. We'll have good food, blankets, tents\r\nto shelter us from the rain, and unlimited ammunition to batter the\r\nenemy's works.”\r\n\r\nThe investment of Vicksburg had been so rapid and complete that\r\nJohnston, the man whom Grant had the most cause to fear, could not unite\r\nwith Pemberton, and he had retired toward Jackson, hoping to form a new\r\narmy. Only three days after Champion Hill Grant had drawn his semicircle\r\nof steel around Vicksburg and its thirty thousand men, and the navy in\r\nthe rivers completed the dead line.\r\n\r\nDick rode with Colonel Winchester and took the best view they could get\r\nof Vicksburg, the little city which had suddenly become of such vast\r\nmilitary importance.\r\n\r\nNow and then on the long, lower course of the Mississippi, bluffs rise,\r\nalthough at far intervals. Memphis stands on one group and hundreds\r\nof miles south Vicksburg stands on another. The Vicksburg plateau runs\r\nsouthward to the Big Bayou, which curves around them on the south and\r\neast, and the eastern slope of the uplift has been cut and gulleyed by\r\nmany torrents. So strong has been the effect of the rushing water upon\r\nthe soft soil that these cuts have become deep winding ravines, often\r\nwith perpendicular banks. One of the ravines is ten miles long. Another\r\ncuts the plateau itself for six miles, and a permanent stream flows\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nThe colonel and Dick saw everywhere rivers, brooks, bayous, hills,\r\nmarshes and thickets, the whole turned by the Southern engineers into\r\na vast and most difficult line of intrenchments. Grant now had forty\r\nthousand men for the attack or siege, but he and his generals did\r\nnot yet know that most of the scattered Confederate army had gathered\r\ntogether again, and was inside. They believed that Vicksburg was held by\r\nfifteen thousand men at the utmost.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of it, Colonel?” asked Dick, as they sat horseback on\r\none of the highest hills.\r\n\r\n“It will be hard to take, despite the help of the navy. Did you ever see\r\nanother country cut up so much by nature and offering such natural help\r\nto defenders?”\r\n\r\n“I've heard a lot of Vicksburg. I remember, Colonel, that, despite its\r\nsmallness, it is one of the great river towns of the South.”\r\n\r\n“So it is, Dick. I was here once, when I was a boy before the Mexican\r\nwar. Down on the bar, the low place between the bluffs and the river,\r\nwas the dueling ground, and it was also the place for sudden fights. It\r\nand Natchez, I suppose, were rivals for the wild and violent life of the\r\ngreat river.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, it has a bigger fight on its hands now than was ever dreamed\r\nof by any of those men.”\r\n\r\n“I think you're right, Dick, but the general means to attack at once. We\r\nmay carry it by storm.”\r\n\r\nDick looked again at the vast entanglement of creeks, bayous, ravines,\r\nforests and thickets. Like other young officers, he had his opinion, but\r\nhe had the good sense to keep it to himself. He and the colonel rejoined\r\nthe regiment, and presently the trumpets were calling again for battle.\r\nThe men of Champion Hill, sanguine of success, marched straight upon\r\nVicksburg. All the officers of the Winchester regiment were dismounted,\r\nas their portion of the line was too difficult for horses.\r\n\r\nTheir advance, as at Champion Hill, was over ground wooded heavily and\r\nthey soon heard the reports of the rifles before them. Bullets began to\r\ncut the leaves and twigs, carrying away the bushes, scarring the trees\r\nand now and then taking human life. The Winchester men fired\r\nwhenever they saw an enemy, and with them it was largely an affair\r\nof sharpshooters, but on both left and right the battle rolled more\r\nheavily. The Southerners, behind their powerful fortifications at the\r\nheads of the ravines and on the plateau, beat back every attack.\r\n\r\nBefore long the trumpets sounded the recall and the short battle ceased.\r\nGrant had discovered that he could not carry Vicksburg by a sudden\r\nrush and he recoiled for a greater effort. He discovered, too, from the\r\nresistance and the news brought later by his scouts that an army almost\r\nas numerous as his own was in the town.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment made camp on a solid, dry piece of ground beyond\r\nthe range of the Southern works, and the men, veterans now, prepared\r\nfor their comfort. The comrades ate supper to the slow booming of great\r\nguns, where the advanced cannon of either side engaged in desultory\r\nduel.\r\n\r\nThe distant reports did not disturb Dick. They were rather soothing. He\r\nwas glad enough to rest after so much exertion and so much danger and\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n“I feel as if I were an empty shell,” he said, “and I've got to wait\r\nuntil nature comes along and fills up the shell again with a human\r\nbeing.”\r\n\r\n“In my school in Vermont,” said Warner, “they'd call that a considerable\r\nabuse of metaphor, but all metaphors are fair in war. Besides, it's just\r\nthe way I feel, too. Do you think, Dick, we'll settle down to a regular\r\nsiege?”\r\n\r\n“Knowing General Grant as we do, not from what he tells us, since he\r\nhasn't taken Pennington and you and me into his confidence as he ought\r\nto, but from our observation of his works, I should say that he would\r\nsoon attack again in full force.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you, Knight of the Penetrating Mind, but meanwhile I'm\r\ngoing to enjoy myself.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, George?”\r\n\r\n“A mail has come through by means of the river, and my good father and\r\nmother--God bless 'em--have sent me what they knew I would value most,\r\nsomething which is at once an intellectual exercise, an entertainment,\r\nand a consolation in bereavement.”\r\n\r\nDick and Pennington sat up. Warner's words were earnest and portentous.\r\nBesides, they were very long, which indicated that he was not jesting.\r\n\r\n“Go ahead, George. Show us what it is!” said Dick eagerly.\r\n\r\nWarner drew from the inside pocket of his waist coat a worn volume which\r\nhe handled lovingly.\r\n\r\n“This,” he said, “is the algebra, with which I won the highest honors\r\nin our academy. I have missed it many and many a time since I came into\r\nthis war. It is filled with the most beautiful problems, Dick, questions\r\nwhich will take many a good man a whole night to solve. When I think of\r\nthe joyous hours I've spent over it some of the tenderest chords in my\r\nnature are touched.”\r\n\r\nPennington uttered a deep groan and buried his face in the grass. Then\r\nhe raised it again and said mournfully:\r\n\r\n“Let's make a solemn agreement, Dick, to watch over our poor comrade.\r\nI always knew that something was wrong with his mind, although he means\r\nwell, and his heart is in the right place. As for me, as soon as I\r\nfinished my algebra I sold it, and took a solemn oath never to look\r\ninside one again. That I call the finest proof of sanity anybody could\r\ngive. Oh, look at him, Dick! He's studying his blessed algebra and\r\ndoesn't hear a word I say!”\r\n\r\nWarner was buried deep in the pages of a plus b and x minus y, and Dick\r\nand Pennington, rising solemnly, walked noiselessly from the presence\r\naround to the other side of the little opening where they lay down\r\nagain. The bit of nonsense relieved them, but it was far from being\r\nnonsense to Warner. His soul was alight. As he dived into the intricate\r\nproblems memories came with them. Lying there in the Southern thickets\r\nin the close damp heat of summer he saw again his Vermont mountains with\r\ntheir slopes deep in green and their crests covered with snow. The sharp\r\nair of the northern winter blew down upon him, and he saw the clear\r\nwaters of the little rivers, cold as ice, foaming over the stones. That\r\nair was sharp and vital, but, after a while, he came back to himself and\r\nclosed his book with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me for inattention, boys,” he said, “but while I was enjoying\r\nmy algebra I was also thinking of old times back there in Vermont, when\r\nnobody was shooting at anybody else.”\r\n\r\nDick and Pennington walked solemnly back and sat down beside him again.\r\n\r\n“Returned to his right mind. Quite sane now,” said Pennington. “But\r\ndon't you think, Dick, we ought to take that exciting book away from\r\nhim? The mind of youth in its tender formative state can be inflamed\r\neasily by light literature.”\r\n\r\nWarner smiled and put his beloved book in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“No, boys,” he said, “you won't take it away from me, but as soon\r\nas this war is over I shall advance from it to studies of a somewhat\r\nsimilar nature, but much higher in character, and so difficult that\r\nsolving them will afford a pleasure keener and more penetrating than\r\nanything else I know.”\r\n\r\n“What is your greatest ambition, Warner?” asked Pennington. “Do you,\r\nlike all the rest of us, want to be President of the United States?”\r\n\r\n“Not for a moment. I've already been in training several years to be\r\npresident of Harvard University. What higher place could mortal ask?\r\nNone, because there is none to ask for.”\r\n\r\n“I can understand you, George,” said Dick. “My great-grandfather became\r\nthe finest scholar ever known in the West. There was something of the\r\npoet in him too. He had a wonderful feeling for nature and the forest.\r\nHe had a remarkable chance for observation as he grew up on the border,\r\nand was the close comrade in the long years of Indian fighting of Henry\r\nWare, who was the greatest governor of Kentucky. As I think I've\r\ntold you fellows, Harry Kenton, Governor Ware's great-grandson and my\r\ncomrade, is fighting on the other side.”\r\n\r\n“I knew of the great Dr. Cotter long before I met you, Dick,” replied\r\nWarner. “I read his book on the Indians of the Northern Mississippi\r\nValley. Not merely their history and habits, but their legends, their\r\nfolk lore, and the wonderful poetic glow so rich and fine that he threw\r\nover everything. There was something almost Homeric in his description\r\nof the great young Wyandot chieftain Timmendiquas or White Lightning,\r\nwhom he acclaimed as the finest type of savage man the age had known.”\r\n\r\n“He and Henry Ware fought Timmendiquas for years, and after the great\r\npeace they were friends throughout their long lives.”\r\n\r\n“And I've studied, too, his wonderful book on the Birds and Mammals\r\nof North America,” continued Warner with growing enthusiasm. “What\r\nmarvelous stores of observation and memory! Ah, Dick, those were\r\nexciting days, and a man had opportunities for real and vital\r\nexperiences!”\r\n\r\nDick and Pennington laughed.\r\n\r\n“What about Vicksburg, old praiser of past times?” asked Frank. “Don't\r\nyou think we'll have some lively experiences trying to take it? And\r\nwasn't there something real and vital about Bull Run and Shiloh and\r\nPerryville and Stone River and all the rest? Don't you worry, George.\r\nYou're living in exciting times yourself.”\r\n\r\n“That's so,” said Warner calmly. “I had forgotten it for the moment.\r\nWe've been readers of history and now we're makers of it. It's\r\nfunny--and maybe it isn't funny--but the makers of history often\r\nknow little about what they're making. The people who come along long\r\nafterward put them in their places and size up what they have done.”\r\n\r\n“They can give all the reasons they please why I won this war,” said\r\nPennington, “but even history-makers are entitled to a rest. Since\r\nthere's no order to the contrary I mean to stretch out and go to sleep.\r\nDick, you and George can discuss your problems all night.”\r\n\r\nBut they went to sleep also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE OPEN DOOR\r\n\r\n\r\n“Dick,” said Colonel Winchester the next morning, “I think you are the\r\nbest scout and trailer among my young officers. Mr. Pennington, you are\r\nprobably the best on the plains, and I've no doubt, Warner, that you\r\nwould do well in the mountains, but for the hills, forests and rivers\r\nI'll have to choose Dick. I've another errand for you, my boy. You're\r\nto go on foot, and you're to take this dispatch to Admiral Porter, who\r\ncommands the iron-clads in the river near the city. Conceal it carefully\r\nabout you, but I anticipate no great danger for you, as Vicksburg is\r\npretty well surrounded by our forces.”\r\n\r\nThe dispatch was written on thin, oiled paper. Dick hid it away in the\r\nlining of his coat and departed upon another important mission, full\r\nof pride that he should be chosen for it. He had all the passwords and\r\ncarried two good pistols in his belt. Rich in experience, he felt able\r\nto care for himself, even should the peril be greater than Colonel\r\nWinchester had expected.\r\n\r\nThe sun was not far above the horizon but it was warm and brilliant,\r\nand it lighted up the earth, throwing a golden glow over the plateau of\r\nVicksburg, the great maze of ravines and thickets and the many waters.\r\n\r\nHe passed along the lines, walking rapidly southward, and saw more than\r\none officer of his acquaintance. Hertford's cavalry were in a field, and\r\nthe colonel himself sat on a portion of the rail fence that had enclosed\r\nit. He hailed the lad pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“Into the forest again, Dick,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Not this time, sir,” Dick replied. “It's just a little trip, down the\r\nriver.”\r\n\r\n“Success to the trip and a speedy return.”\r\n\r\nDick nodded and walked on. He was quite sure that his dispatch was an\r\norder from Grant for Porter to come up the stream and join in a general\r\nattack which everybody felt sure was planned for an early date.\r\n\r\nAs he passed through the regiments and brigades he received much\r\ngood-humored chaff. The great war of America differed widely from the\r\ngreat wars of Europe. The officers and men were more nearly on a plane\r\nof equality. The vast majority of them had been volunteers in the\r\nbeginning and perhaps this feeling of comradeship made them fight all\r\nthe better. North and South were alike in it.\r\n\r\n“Which way, sonny?” called a voice from a group. “You don't find the\r\nfighting down there. It's back toward Vicksburg.”\r\n\r\nDick nodded and smiled.\r\n\r\n“Maybe he's out walking for exercise. These officers ride too much.”\r\n\r\nDick walked on with a steady swinging step. He regarded the sunbrowned,\r\ncareless youths with the genuine affection of a brother. Many of them\r\nwere as young as he or younger, but they were now veterans of battle\r\nand march. Napoleon's soldiers themselves could not have boasted of more\r\nexperience than they.\r\n\r\nHe was coming to the last link in the steel chain, and the colonel of\r\na regiment, an old man, warned him to be careful as he approached the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n“Southern sharpshooters are among the ravines and thickets,” he said.\r\n“They fired on our lads about dawn and then escaped easily in the thick\r\ncover.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” said Dick, “I'll be on my guard.” Yet he did not feel\r\nthe presence of danger. Youth perhaps becomes more easily hardened in\r\nwar than middle age, or perhaps it thinks less of consequences. The\r\nUnion cannon, many of great weight and power, had begun already to\r\nfire upon Vicksburg. Huge shells and shot were rained upon the city.\r\nPemberton had two hundred guns facing the river and the army, but to\r\nspare his ammunition they made little reply.\r\n\r\nDick looked back now and then. He saw flakes of fire on the northern\r\nhorizon, puffs of smoke and the curving shells. He felt that Vicksburg\r\nwas no pleasant place to be in just now, and yet it must be full of\r\ncivilians, many of them women and children. He was sorry for them. It\r\nwas Dick's nature to see both sides of a quarrel. He could never hate\r\nthe Southerners, because they saw one way and he another.\r\n\r\nIt was a passing emotion. It was too fine a morning for youth to grieve.\r\nAt the distance the plumes of smoke made by the shells became decorative\r\nrather than deadly. From a crest he saw upon the plateau of Vicksburg\r\nand even discerned the dim outline of houses. Looking the other way,\r\nhe saw the smoke of the iron-clads down the river, and he also caught\r\nglimpses of the Mississippi, gold in the morning sun over its vast\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\nThen he entered the thickets, and, bearing in mind the kindly warning\r\nof the old colonel, proceeded slowly and with extreme caution. The\r\nSoutherners knew every inch of the ground here and he knew none. He\r\ncame to a ravine and to his dismay found that a considerable stream was\r\nflowing through it toward the bayou. It was yellow water, and he thought\r\nhe might find a tree, fallen across the stream, which would serve him as\r\na foot log, but a hunt of a few minutes disclosed none, and, hesitating\r\nno longer, he prepared to wade.\r\n\r\nHe put his belt with the pistols in it around his neck and stepped in\r\nboldly. His feet sank in the mud. The water rose to his knees and then\r\nto his waist. It was, in truth, deeper than he had expected--one could\r\nnever tell about these yellow, opaque streams. He took another step and\r\nplunged into a hole up to his shoulders.\r\n\r\nAngry that he should be wet through and through, and with such muddy\r\nwater too, he crossed the stream.\r\n\r\nHe looked down with dismay at his uniform. The sun would soon dry it,\r\nbut until he got a chance to clean it, it would remain discolored and\r\nyellow, like the jeans clothes which the poorer farmers of the South\r\noften wore. And yet the accident that he bemoaned, the bath in water\r\nthick with mud, was to prove his salvation.\r\n\r\nDick shook himself like a big dog, throwing off as much of the water as\r\nhe could. He had kept his pistols dry and he rebuckled his belt around\r\nhis waist. Then he returned to his errand. Among the thickets he saw but\r\nlittle. Vicksburg, the Mississippi, and the Union camp disappeared. He\r\nbeheld only a soft soil, many bushes and scrub forest. After going a\r\nlittle distance he was compelled to stop again and consider. It was\r\ncurious how one could lose direction in so small a space.\r\n\r\nHe paused and listened, intending to regain his course through the sense\r\nof hearing. From the north and east came the thunder of the siege guns.\r\nIt had grown heavier and was continuous now. Once more he was sorry for\r\nVicksburg, because the Union gunners were unsurpassed and he was sure\r\nthat bombs and shells were raining upon the devoted town.\r\n\r\nNow he knew that he must go west by south, and he made his way over\r\ndifficult country, crossing ravines, climbing hills, and picking his\r\npath now and then through soft ground, the most exhausting labor of all.\r\nThe sun poured down upon him and his uniform dried fast. He had just\r\ncrossed one of the ravines and was climbing into the thicket beyond when\r\na voice asked:\r\n\r\n“See any of the Yanks in front?”\r\n\r\nDick's heart stood still, and then all his presence of mind came\r\nback. Not in vain had the kindly colonel warned him of the Southern\r\nsharpshooters in the bush.\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied. “They seem to be farther up. One of our fellows told\r\nme he saw a whole regiment of them off there to the right.”\r\n\r\nHe plunged deeper into the bush and walked on as if he were among his\r\nown comrades. He realized that his faded uniform with its dye of yellow\r\nmud had caused him to be mistaken for one of Pemberton's men. His\r\naccent, which was Kentuckian and therefore Southern, had helped him\r\nalso. He passed three or four other men, bent over, rifle in hand and\r\nwatching, and he nodded to them familiarly. In such a crisis he knew\r\nthat boldness and ease were his best cards, and he said to one of the\r\nmen, with a laugh:\r\n\r\n“You'll have to tell us Tennesseeans about all your bayous and creeks.\r\nI've just fallen into one that had no right to be there.”\r\n\r\n“You Tennesseeans need a bath anyhow,” replied the man, chuckling.\r\n\r\n“We'd never choose a Mississippi stream for it,” said Dick in the\r\nsame vein, and passed on leaving the rifleman in high good humor. How\r\nwonderfully these Southerners were like the Northerners! He noticed\r\npresently a half-dozen other sharpshooters in the Confederate butternut,\r\nprowling among the bushes, and through an opening he saw his own people\r\nto the west, but too far away to be reached by anything but artillery.\r\nThe slow, deep music of the Northern guns came steadily to his ear, but\r\ntheir fire was always turned toward Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nDick knew that his position was extremely critical. Perhaps it was\r\ngrowing more so all the while, but he was never cooler. A quiet lad, he\r\nalways rose wonderfully to an emergency. He was quite sure that he\r\nwas among Mississippi troops, and they could not possibly know all the\r\nsoldiers from the other states gathered for the defense of Vicksburg. He\r\ndid not differ from those around him in any respect, except that he did\r\nnot carry a rifle.\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked back thoughtfully at the distant Union troops.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me how they're posted?” he said to a tall, thin\r\nmiddle-aged man who had a chew of tobacco in his cheek. “I carry\r\ndispatches to General Pemberton, and the more information I can give him\r\nthe better.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I kin tell you,” replied the man, somewhat flattered. “They're\r\nposted everywhere. What, with their army and them boats of theirs in the\r\nriver, they've got a high fence around us, all staked and ridered.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn't take any more work to tear a fence down than it does to\r\nbuild it up.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon you're right thar, stranger. But was you at Champion Hill?”\r\n\r\n“No, I missed that.”\r\n\r\n“Then it was a good thing for you that you did. I didn't set much store\r\nby the Yanks when this war began. One good Southerner could whip five of\r\n'em any time, our rip-roarin', fire-eatin' speech-makers said. I knowed\r\nthen, too, that they was right, but I was up thar in Kentucky a while,\r\nan' after Donelson I reckoned that four was about as many as I wanted\r\nto tackle all to oncet. Then thar was Shiloh, an' I kinder had a thought\r\nthat if three of 'em jumped on me at one time I'd hev my hands purty\r\nfull to lick 'em. Then come Corinth, an,' reasonin' with myself, I said\r\nI wouldn't take on more'n two Yanks at the same time. An' now, since\r\nI've been at Champion Hill, I know that the Yank is a pow'ful good\r\nfighter, an' I reckon one to one jest about suits me, an' even then I'd\r\nlike to have a leetle advantage in the draw.”\r\n\r\n“I feel that way about it, too. The Yankees are going to make a heap\r\nof trouble for us here. But I must be going. What's the best path into\r\nVicksburg?”\r\n\r\n“See that little openin' in the bushes. Follow it. Jest over the hill\r\nyou'll run into a passel of our fellers, but pay no 'tention to 'em. If\r\nthey ask you who you are an' whar you're boun' tell 'em to go straight\r\nto blazes, while you go to Vicksburg.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Dick, “I like to meet an obliging and polite man like\r\nyou. It helps even in war.”\r\n\r\n“Don't mention it. When I wuz a little shaver my ma told me always to\r\nmind my manners, an' when I didn't she whaled the life out of me. An',\r\ndo you know, stranger, she's just a leetle, withered old woman, but if\r\nshe could 'pear here right now I'd be willin' to set down right in these\r\nbushes an' say, 'Ma, take up that stick over thar an' beat me across the\r\nshoulders an' back with it as hard as you kin.' I'd feel good all over.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you,” said Dick, who thought of his own mother.\r\n\r\nHe followed the indicated path until he was out of sight of everybody,\r\nand then he plunged into the bushes and marsh toward the river. When he\r\nwas well hidden he stopped and considered.\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that he had wandered from the right road, but\r\nit was no easy task to get back into it. There was an unconscious\r\nConfederate cordon about him and he must pass through it somewhere. He\r\nmoved farther toward the river, but only went deeper into the swamp.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the south and soon reached firm ground, but he heard\r\nConfederate pickets talking in front of him. Then he caught glimpses of\r\ntwo or three men watching among the trees, and he lay down in a clump of\r\nbushes. He might pass them as he had passed the others, but he thought\r\nit wiser not to take the risk.\r\n\r\nHe was willing also to rest a little, as he had done a lot of hard\r\nwalking. His clothing was now dry, and the mud had dried upon it.\r\n\r\nHe turned aside into one of the deep ravines and then into a smaller one\r\nleading from it. The bushes were dense there and he lay down among them,\r\nso completely hidden that he was invisible ten feet away. Here he still\r\nheard the mutter of the guns, which came in a long, droning sound, and\r\noccasionally a rifle cracked at some point closer by. The Union army\r\nwas still busy and he felt a few moments of despondency. His dispatch\r\nundoubtedly was of great importance, and yet he was not able to deliver\r\nit. It was highly probable that for precaution's sake other messengers\r\nbore the same dispatch, but he was anxious to arrive with his\r\nnevertheless, and he wanted, too, to arrive first. The last now seemed\r\nimpossible and the first improbable.\r\n\r\nThe crackling fire came nearer. Owing to the lack of percussion caps,\r\nPemberton had ordered his men to use their rifles sparingly, but\r\nevidently a considerable body of sharpshooters near Dick were attempting\r\na flanking movement of some kind, and meant to carry it out with\r\nbullets. He was impatient to see, but prudence kept him in his covert, a\r\nprudence that was soon justified, as presently he heard voices very near\r\nhim and then the sound of footsteps.\r\n\r\nHe rose up a little and saw several hundred Confederate soldiers passing\r\non the slopes not more than a hundred yards away. They went south of\r\nhim, and he recognized with growing alarm that the wall across his way\r\nwas growing higher. When they were gone and he could no longer hear\r\ntheir tread among the bushes he slipped from his hiding place and went\r\ndirectly toward Vicksburg. Being within an iron ring he thought that\r\nperhaps he would be safer somewhere near the center. He might make his\r\nway without much trouble through the vast confused crowd in Vicksburg,\r\nand then in the night go down the river's edge and to the fleet.\r\n\r\nIt was a daring idea, so very daring that it appealed to the strain of\r\nhigh adventure in the lad. He was encouraged, too, by his earlier and\r\neasy success in passing among the Confederate soldiers. But in order not\r\nto appear reckless and to satisfy his own conscience he tried once more\r\nfor the way to the south. But the soldiers entirely barred the path\r\nthere, and, being on some duty that required extreme vigilance, they\r\nwere likely to prove exacting.\r\n\r\nHe advanced with a clear mind toward Vicksburg, picking his way among\r\nthe forests and ravines, but, after long walking over most difficult\r\nground, he saw before him extensive earthworks thronged with Southern\r\ntroops. When he turned westward the result was the same, and then it\r\nbecame evident that there was no flaw in the iron ring. He could not go\r\nthrough to Porter, he could not go back to his own army, but Vicksburg\r\ninvited him as a guest.\r\n\r\nHe would make the trial at night. It was a long wait, but he dared not\r\nrisk it by day, and, going back into one of the ravines, he sought\r\na secluded and sheltered place. Threshing the bushes to drive away\r\npossible snakes, he crawled into a clump and lay there. Resolved to be\r\npatient in spite of everything, he did not stir, but listened to the far\r\nthrobbing of the cannon which poured an incessant storm of missiles upon\r\nunhappy Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nThe warmth and the heavy air in the ravine were relaxing. His brain grew\r\nso dull and heavy that he fell asleep, and when he awoke the twilight\r\nwas coming. And yet he had lost nothing. He had gained rather. The time\r\nhad passed. His body had been strengthened and his nerves steadied while\r\nhe slept.\r\n\r\nThe distant booming of the guns still came. He had expected it. That was\r\nGrant. He had wrapped the coil of steel around Vicksburg and he would\r\nnever relax. Dick felt that there was no hope for the town, unless\r\nJohnston outside could gather a powerful army and fight Grant on even\r\nterms. But he considered it impossible, and there, too, was the great\r\nartery of the river along which flowed men and supplies of every kind\r\nfor the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Southern twilight turned swiftly into night and, coming from his\r\nlair, Dick walked boldly toward the town. He had eaten nothing since\r\nmorning, but he had not noticed it, until this moment, when he began to\r\nfeel a little faintness. He resolved that Vicksburg should supply him.\r\nIt was curious how much help he expected of Vicksburg, a hostile town.\r\n\r\nHe saw lights soon both to right and to left and he strengthened his\r\nsoul. He knew that he must be calm, but alert and quick with the right\r\nanswer. With his singular capacity for meeting a crisis he advanced into\r\nthe thick of danger with a smiling face, even as his great ancestor,\r\nPaul Cotter, had often done.\r\n\r\nHis calm was of short duration. There was a rushing sound, something\r\nstruck violently, and a tremendous explosion followed. Fire flashed\r\nbefore Dick's eyes, pieces of red hot metal whistled past his head,\r\nearth spattered him and he was thrown to the ground.\r\n\r\nHe sprang up again, understanding all instantly. A shell from his own\r\narmy had burst near him, and he had been thrown down by the concussion.\r\nBut he had not been hurt, and in a few seconds his pulse beat steadily.\r\n\r\nHe heard a shout of laughter as he stood, brushing the fresh dirt from\r\nhis clothing. He glanced up in some anger, but he saw at once that the\r\narrival of the shell had been most fortunate for his plan. To come near\r\nannihilation by a Federal gun certainly invested him with a Confederate\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt was a group of young soldiers who were laughing and their amusement\r\nwas entirely good-natured. They would have laughed the same way had the\r\nharmless adventure befallen one of their own number. Dick judged that\r\nthey were from the Southwest.\r\n\r\n“Close call,” he said, smiling that attractive smile, which was visible\r\neven in the twilight.\r\n\r\n“It was a friendly shell,” said one of the youths, “and it concluded\r\nnot to come too close to you. These Yankee shells are so loving that\r\nsometimes they spray themselves in little pieces all over a fellow, like\r\na shower of rice over a bride at a wedding.”\r\n\r\n“How long do you think the Yankees will keep it up?” asked Dick, putting\r\nindignation in his tone. “Haven't they any respect for the night?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit. That fellow Grant is a pounder. They say he'll blow away the\r\nwhole plateau of Vicksburg if we don't drive him off.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we'll do it. You wait till old Joe Johnston comes up. Then we'll\r\nshut him between the jaws of a vise and squeeze the life out of him.”\r\n\r\n“Hope so. Where've you been?”\r\n\r\n“Down below the town. I'm coming back with messages.”\r\n\r\n“So long. Good luck. Keep straight ahead, and you'll find all the\r\ngenerals you want.”\r\n\r\nThe lights increased and he went into a small tavern, where he bought\r\nfood and a cup of coffee, paying in gold. The tavern keeper asked no\r\nquestions, but his eyes gleamed at sight of the yellow coin.\r\n\r\n“Mighty little of this comes my way now,” he said frankly, “and our\r\nown money is worth less and less every day. If things keep on the way\r\nthey're headed it'll take a bale of it as big as a bale of cotton to pay\r\nfor one good, square meal.”\r\n\r\nDick laughed.\r\n\r\n“Not so bad as that,” he said. “You wait until we've given Grant a big\r\nthrashing and have cleared their boats out of the river. Then you'll see\r\nour money becoming real.”\r\n\r\nThe man shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Seein' will be believin',” he said, “an' as I ain't seein' I ain't\r\nbelievin'.”\r\n\r\nDick with a friendly good night went out. Grant, the persistent, was\r\nstill at work. His cannon flared on the dark horizon and the shells\r\ncrashed in Vicksburg. Scarcely any portion of the town was safe. Now and\r\nthen a house was smashed in and often the shells found victims.\r\n\r\nThe town was full of terror and confusion. Many of the rich planters had\r\ncome there with their families for refuge. Women and children hid from\r\nthe terrible fire, and the civilians already had begun to burrow. Caves\r\nhad been dug deep into the sides of the ravines and hundreds found in\r\nthem a rude but safe shelter.\r\n\r\nDick now found that his plans were going wrong. He could wander about\r\nalmost at will and to any one to whom he spoke he still claimed to be\r\na Tennesseean, but he knew that it could not last forever. Sooner or\r\nlater, some officer would question him closely, and then his tale would\r\nbe too thin for truth.\r\n\r\nUnable to make a way toward the river, he returned to the slopes and\r\nravines, where they were digging the caves, and then fortune which had\r\nbeen smiling upon him turned its face the other way. A small man in\r\nbutternut and an enormous felt hat passed near. He did not see Dick,\r\nbut his very presence gave the lad a shiver. He believed afterward that\r\nbefore he saw him he had felt the proximity of Slade.\r\n\r\nThe man, carrying a rifle, was hurrying toward the center of the town,\r\nand Dick, after one long look, hurried at equal speed the other way. He\r\nknew that Slade, if he saw him, would recognize him at once. Dusk and a\r\nmuddy uniform would not protect him.\r\n\r\nIt was his idea now to go down through the ravines and make another\r\ntrial toward the South. He saw ahead of him a line of intrenchments,\r\nwhich he was resolved to pass in some fashion, but the face of fortune\r\nwas still away from him. The unknown officers who at any time might ask\r\ntoo many questions appeared.\r\n\r\nA captain, a sunbrowned, alert man, stopped him at the edge of the\r\nbushes which clothed the slopes of the ravine.\r\n\r\n“Your regiment?” he asked sharply.\r\n\r\n“Tennessee regiment, sir,” replied Dick, afraid to mention any number,\r\nsince this officer might be a Tennesseean himself, and would want\r\nfurther identification. But the man was not to be put off--Dick judged\r\nfrom his uniform that he was a colonel--and demanded sharply his\r\nregiment's number and his business.\r\n\r\nThe lad mumbled something under his breath, hopeful that he would pass\r\non, but the officer stepped forward, looked at him closely and then\r\nsuddenly turned back the collar of his army jacket, disclosing a bit of\r\nthe under side yet blue.\r\n\r\n“Thunderation, a Yankee spy!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nDick always believed that his life was due to a sudden and violent\r\nimpulse, or rather a convulsive jerk, because he had no time to think.\r\nHe threw off the officer's hand, dashed his fist into his face, and,\r\nwithout waiting to see the effect, ran headlong among the bushes down\r\nthe side of the ravine. He heard a shouting behind him, the reports of\r\nseveral shots, the rapid tread of feet, and he knew that the man-hunt\r\nwas on.\r\n\r\nHe had all the instincts of the hunted to seek cover, and the night was\r\nhis friend. But few lights glimmered in that portion of Vicksburg, and\r\nin many parts of the ravine the bushes were thick. He darted down the\r\nslope at great speed, then turned and ran along its side, still keeping\r\nwell under cover. Where the shadows were darkest and the bushes thickest\r\nhe paused panting.\r\n\r\nHe heard his pursuers calling to one another, and he also heard the\r\nexcited voices of people in the ravine. The civilians had been aroused\r\nby the shots so close by and he thought the confusion would help him. He\r\nstood in the deep shadow, his breath gradually growing easier, and then\r\nhe started down the ravine, coming to a little path that led along\r\nthe side of the slope. He noticed a dark opening, and as the voices of\r\npursuers were now coming nearer, he popped into it, trusting to blind\r\nluck.\r\n\r\nDick had thought it was a mere wash-out or deep recess, but at the third\r\nstep his foot struck upon a carpet and he saw ahead a dim light. He\r\npaused, amazed, and then he remembered that he had heard about the\r\ncivilians digging caves for shelter from the shells and bombs. Evidently\r\nsome forethoughtful man had prepared his cave early.\r\n\r\nUncertain what to do he did nothing, pressing his back against the earth\r\nand listening. No sound came, and the dim light still flickering ahead\r\nreassured him.\r\n\r\nThe opening through which he had come was large, and admitted plenty\r\nof fresh air. As he stood four or five feet from the entrance he saw\r\nseveral soldiers hurrying along the path, and he knew they were hunting\r\nfor him. He realized then his fortune in finding this improvised\r\ncave-house. After the soldiers passed he walked gently toward the light.\r\nApparently the regular occupants were gone away for the time, and he\r\nmight find a hiding place there until it was safe to go out.\r\n\r\nThe passage was narrow, but the carpet was still under his feet, and\r\nfurther in, the sides and roof of the earthen walls had been covered\r\nwith planks. The light grew brighter and he was quite sure that a room\r\nof some size was just ahead. His curiosity became so great that it\r\nsmothered all apprehension, and he stepped boldly into the room, where\r\nthe lamp burned on a table.\r\n\r\nHe would have stepped back as quickly, but a pair of great burning eyes\r\ncaught his and held them. A bed was standing against the board wall of\r\nthe cave, and in this bed lay an old man with a huge bald head, immense\r\nwhite eyebrows and eyes of extraordinary intensity.\r\n\r\nOnce more did Colonel Charles Woodville and Richard Mason stare into the\r\neyes of each other, and for a long time neither spoke.\r\n\r\n“I managed to escape from Jackson with my little family,” said the\r\ncolonel at length, “and I thought that in this, so to say, sylvan\r\nretreat I might drop all undesirable acquaintances that I made there.”\r\n\r\nThe whole scene was grotesque and wild to Dick. It was like a passage\r\nout of the Arabian Nights, and an extraordinary spirit of recklessness\r\nseized him.\r\n\r\n“I appreciate your words, sir,” he said, “and I can understand your\r\nfeelings. I have felt myself that it was never wise to go where one\r\nmight not be welcome, and yet chance plays us such tricks that neither\r\nyour wish nor mine is granted.”\r\n\r\nThe old man then raised his head a little higher on the pillow. A spark\r\nleaped from the burning eyes.\r\n\r\n“A lad of spirit,” he said. “I would not withhold praise where praise\r\nis due. I recall meeting some one who resembled you very much. Perhaps a\r\nbrother of yours, eh?”\r\n\r\n“No, he was not my brother.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it does not matter and we will not pursue the subject. How does\r\nit happen that you have come into this hillside castle of mine?”\r\n\r\nYoung Mason saw a flicker of amusement in the eyes of the old man. He\r\nwas aware that in his muddy uniform he made no imposing figure, but\r\nhis spirit was as high as ever, and the touch of recklessness was still\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“I saw some men coming down the path,” he replied; “men with whom I do\r\nnot care to associate, and I turned aside to avoid them. I beheld\r\nthe open door and stepped within, but I did not know the chamber was\r\noccupied, and it was far from my purpose to intrude upon you or any one.\r\nI trust, sir, that you will believe me.”\r\n\r\nThe lad took off his cap and bowed. His face was now revealed more\r\nclearly, and it was a fine one, splendidly molded, intellectual, and\r\nwith noble blue eyes. After all, despite the mud and stains, he made a\r\ngraceful figure as he stood there, so obviously confident of himself,\r\nbut respectful.\r\n\r\nThe spark leaped again from the eyes of Colonel Woodville, and,\r\nremembering something, there was a slight warmth about the heart which\r\nlately had been so cold and bitter.\r\n\r\n“I do not blame you,” he said. “A lad, one in his formative years,\r\ncannot be too careful about his associates. Doubtless you were justified\r\nin taking advantage of the open door. But now that you are here may I\r\nask you what you purpose next to do?”\r\n\r\n“I admit, sir, that the question is natural,” replied Dick, suiting his\r\ntone and manner to those of the old man. “I have scarcely had time yet\r\nto form a purpose, but, since the danger of contamination of which we\r\nspoke still exists, it occurs to me that perhaps I might stay here a\r\nwhile. Is there some nook or a cover in which I might rest? I hope I do\r\nnot trespass too much upon your hospitality.”\r\n\r\nColonel Woodville pondered. His great white eyebrows were drawn together\r\nand, for a moment or two, he gazed down the beak of his nose.\r\n\r\n“I confess,” he said, “that the appeal to hospitality moves me. I am\r\nstirred somewhat, too, by pleasant recollections of the lad who looked\r\nlike you. But wait, my daughter is coming. We will confer with her.\r\nMargaret is a most capable woman.”\r\n\r\nDick heard a light step in the passage and he wheeled quickly. Miss\r\nWoodville was before him, a plain, elderly figure in a plain black\r\ndress, with a basket on her arm. The basket contained a fowl and some\r\neggs which she had just bought at a great price. When she saw Dick her\r\nhand flew to her throat, but when the pulse ceased to beat so hard it\r\ncame away and she looked at him fixedly. Then a slow smile like the dawn\r\nspread over the severe, worn face.\r\n\r\n“Come in, Margaret, and put down your basket,” said the colonel in a\r\ngenial tone. “Meanwhile bid welcome to our unexpected guest, a young man\r\nof spirit and quality with whom I was holding converse before you came.\r\nHe does not wish to go out to-night, because there are many violent men\r\nabroad, and he would avoid them.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Dick, and asked in a tone, sharp and commanding:\r\n\r\n“I have your word, young sir, that your unexpected visit to our city was\r\nnot of a secret nature; that is, it was not of a lawless character?”\r\n\r\n“An accident, sir, an accident pure and simple. I answer you on my\r\nhonor. I have seen nothing and I shall not seek to see anything which I\r\nshould not see.”\r\n\r\n“Margaret,” continued the colonel, and now his tone became deferential\r\nas behooved a gentleman speaking to a lady, “shall we ask him to share\r\nour simple quarters to-night?”\r\n\r\nThe lad slowly turned his gaze to the face of the woman. He felt with\r\nall the power of intuition that his fate rested on her decision. But she\r\nwas a woman. And she was, too, a true daughter of her father. A kindred\r\nspark leaped up in her own soul, and she met Dick's gaze. She noted\r\nhis fearless poise, and she saw the gallant spirit in his eye. Then she\r\nturned to her father.\r\n\r\n“I think you wish him to stay, sir,” she said, “and the wish seems right\r\nto me. Our narrow quarters limit our hospitality in quality, but not\r\nin intent. We can offer him nothing but the little alcove behind the\r\nblanket.”\r\n\r\nShe inclined her head toward the blanket, which Dick had not noticed\r\nbefore. It hung near the bed and, wishing to cause this household little\r\ntrouble, he said:\r\n\r\n“Then I assume that you will shelter me for the night, and, if I may, I\r\nwill go at once to my room.”\r\n\r\nColonel Woodville lowered his head upon the pillow and laughed softly.\r\n\r\n“A lad of spirit. A lad of spirit, I repeat,” he said. “No, Margaret,\r\nyou and I could not have turned him from our earthen roof.”\r\n\r\nDick bowed to Miss Woodville, and that little ghost of a tender smile\r\nflitted about her thin lips. Then he lifted the blanket, stepped into\r\nthe dark, and let the curtain fall behind him.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a space until his eyes, used to the dusk, could see dimly.\r\nIt was a tiny room evidently used as a place of storage for clothing and\r\nbedding, but there was space enough for him to lie down, if he bent his\r\nknees a little.\r\n\r\nThe strain upon both muscle and nerve had been very great, and now came\r\ncollapse. Removing his shoes and outer clothing he dropped upon a\r\nroll of bedding and closed his eyes. But he was grateful, deeply and\r\nlastingly grateful. The bread that he had cast upon the waters was\r\nreturning to him fourfold.\r\n\r\nHe heard low voices beyond the blanket, and he did not doubt that they\r\nwere those of Colonel Woodville and his daughter. The woman in plain\r\nblack, with the basket on her arm, had seemed a pathetic figure to him.\r\nHe could not blame them for feeling such intense bitterness. What were\r\nthe causes of the war to people who had been driven from a luxurious\r\nhome to a hole in the side of a ravine?\r\n\r\nHe slept, and when he woke it seemed to be only a moment later, but he\r\nknew from the slender edge of light appearing where the blanket just\r\nfailed to touch the floor that morning had come. He moved gently lest\r\nhe disturb his host in the larger room without, and then he heard the\r\ndistant thunder, which he knew was the booming of Grant's great guns.\r\nAnd so the night had not stopped them! All through the hours that he\r\nslept the cannon had rained steel and death on Vicksburg. Then came a\r\ngreat explosion telling him that a shell had burst somewhere near. It\r\nwas followed by the voice of Colonel Woodville raised in high, indignant\r\ntones:\r\n\r\n“Can't they let a gentleman sleep? Must they wake him with one of their\r\ninfernal shells?”\r\n\r\nHe heard a slight rustling sound and he knew that it was the great bald\r\nhead moving impatiently on the pillows. Inferring that it was early, he\r\nwould have gone back to sleep himself, but slumber would not come. He\r\nremained a while, thoughtful, for his future lay very heavy upon him,\r\nand then he heard the sound of several voices beyond the blanket.\r\n\r\nHe listened closely, trying to number and distinguish them. There were\r\nthree and two belonged to Colonel Woodville and his daughter. The third\r\nrepelled and puzzled him. It seemed to have in it a faint quality of the\r\nfox. It was not loud, and yet that light, snarling, sinister note was\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive, attuned mind can be easily affected by a voice, and the\r\nmenace of the unknown beyond the blanket deepened. Dick felt a curious\r\nprickling at the roots of his hair. He listened intently, but he could\r\nnot understand anything that was spoken, and then he drew himself\r\nforward with great caution.\r\n\r\nThey must be talking about something of importance, because the voices\r\nwere earnest, and sometimes all three spoke at once. He reached a slow\r\nhand toward the blanket. The danger would be great, but he must see.\r\n\r\nHe drew back the blanket slightly, a quarter of an inch, maybe, and\r\nlooked within the room. Then he saw the owner of the sinister voice, and\r\nhe felt that he might have known from the first.\r\n\r\nSlade, standing before Colonel Woodville's bed, his hat in his hand, was\r\ntalking eagerly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE GREAT ASSAULT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light from the door that was always open illumined the room. The\r\nrising sun must have struck full upon it, because it was almost as\r\nbright as day there. Slade was in his butternut uniform, and his rifle\r\nleaned against the wall. Now that he had made the slight opening Dick\r\ncould understand their words.\r\n\r\n“There are spies within Vicksburg, sir,” said Slade. “Colonel Dustin\r\ndetected one last night, but in the darkness he escaped down this\r\nravine. The alarm was spread and he could not have got outside our\r\nlines. I must catch him. It will be a credit to me to do so. I was under\r\nyour command, and, although not in active service owing to your wound,\r\nyour word will go far. I want you to get me an order to search every\r\nhouse or place in which he could hide.”\r\n\r\n“Not too much zeal, my worthy Slade. Talleyrand said that, but you never\r\nheard of him. Excessive suspicion is not a good thing. It was your chief\r\nfault as an overseer, although I willingly pay tribute to your energy\r\nand attention to detail. This business of hunting spies is greatly\r\noverdone. The fate of Vicksburg will be settled by the cannon and the\r\nrifles.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir, they can do us great harm.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to that, my good Slade.”\r\n\r\nThe deep booming note of the distant cannon entered the cave.\r\n\r\n“That is the sound of Grant's guns. He can fight better with those\r\nweapons than with spies.”\r\n\r\nBut Slade persisted, and Colonel Woodville, with an occasional word\r\nfrom his daughter, fenced with him, always using a light bantering tone,\r\nwhile the lad who lay so near listened, his pulses beating hard in his\r\ntemples and throat.\r\n\r\n“Your vigilance is to be commended, my good Slade,” Dick heard Colonel\r\nWoodville say, “but to-day at least I cannot secure such a commission\r\nfor you from General Pemberton. We hear that Grant is massing his troops\r\nfor a grand attack, and there is little time to thresh up all our own\r\nquarters for spies. We must think more of our battle line. To-morrow we\r\nmay have a plan. Come back to me then, and we will talk further on these\r\nmatters.”\r\n\r\n“But think, sir, what a day may cost us!”\r\n\r\n“You show impatience, not to say haste, Slade, and little is ever\r\nachieved by thoughtless haste. The enemy is closing in upon us, and it\r\nmust be our chief effort to break his iron ring. Ah, here is my nephew!\r\nHe may give us further news on these grave matters.”\r\n\r\nDick saw the entrance darken for a moment, then lighten again, and\r\nthat gallant youth, Victor Woodville, with whom he had fought so good a\r\nfight, stood in the room. He was still pale and he carried his left arm\r\nin a sling, but it was evident that his recovery from his wound had been\r\nrapid. Dick saw the stern face of the old colonel brighten a bit, while\r\nthe tender smile curved again about the thin lips of the spinster.\r\n\r\nYoung Woodville gave a warm greeting to his uncle and elderly cousin,\r\nand nodded to Slade. Dick believed from his gesture that he did not like\r\nthe guerilla leader, or at least he hoped so.\r\n\r\n“Victor,” said the colonel, “what word do you bring?”\r\n\r\n“Grant is advancing his batteries, and they seem to be massing for\r\nattack. It will surely come in a day or two.”\r\n\r\n“As I thought. Then we shall need all our energies for immediate battle.\r\nAnd now, Mr. Slade, as I said before, I will see you again to-morrow\r\nabout the matter of which we were speaking. I am old, wounded, and I\r\ngrow weary. I would rest.”\r\n\r\nSlade rose to go. He was not a pleasant sight. His clothes were soiled\r\nand stained, and his face was covered with ragged beard. The eyes were\r\nfull of venom and malice.\r\n\r\n“Good day, Colonel Woodville,” he said, “but I feel that I must bring\r\nthe matter up again. As a scout and leader of irregulars for the\r\nConfederacy. I must be active in order to cope with the enemy's own\r\nscouts and spies. I shall return early to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\nColonel Woodville waved his hand and Slade, bowing, withdrew.\r\n\r\n“Why was he so persistent, Uncle Charles?” asked Victor. “He seemed to\r\nhave some underlying motive.”\r\n\r\n“He always has such a motive, Victor. He is a man who suspects everybody\r\nbecause he knows everybody has a right to suspect him. He may even have\r\nbeen suspecting me, his old, and, I fear, too generous employer. He has\r\na mania about a spy hidden somewhere in Vicksburg.”\r\n\r\nYoung Victor Woodville laughed gayly.\r\n\r\n“What folly,” he said, “for your old overseer, a man of Northern origin\r\nto boot, to suspect you, of all men, of helping a Yankee in any way.\r\nWhy, Uncle Charles, everybody knows that you'd annihilate 'em if you\r\ncould, and that you were making good progress with the task until you\r\ngot that wound.”\r\n\r\nColonel Woodville drew his great, white eyebrows together in his\r\ncharacteristic way.\r\n\r\n“I admit, Victor, that I'm the prince of Yankee haters,” he said.\r\n“They've ruined me, and if they succeed they'll ruin our state and the\r\nwhole South, too. We've fled for refuge to a hole in the ground, and yet\r\nthey come thundering at the door of so poor an abode. Listen!”\r\n\r\nThey heard plainly the far rumble of the cannon. The intensity of the\r\nfire increased with the growing day. Shells and bombs were falling\r\nrapidly on Vicksburg. The face of Colonel Woodville darkened and the\r\neyes under the white thatch burned.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, Victor,” he said, “hate the Yankees as I do, and I hate\r\nthem with all my heart and soul, there are some things a gentleman\r\ncannot do.”\r\n\r\n“What for instance, Uncle?”\r\n\r\n“He cannot break faith. He cannot do evil to those who have done good to\r\nhim. He must repay benefits with benefits. He cannot permit the burden\r\nof obligation to remain upon him. Go to the door, Victor, and see if any\r\none is lurking there.”\r\n\r\nYoung Woodville went to the entrance and returned with word that no one\r\nwas near.\r\n\r\n“Victor,” resumed Colonel Woodville, “this man Slade, who was so\r\npreposterously wrong, this common overseer from the hostile section\r\nwhich seeks with force to put us down, this miserable fellow who had\r\nthe presumption to suspect me, lying here with a wound, received in the\r\ndefense of the Confederacy, was nevertheless right.”\r\n\r\nVictor stared, not understanding, and Colonel Woodville raised himself a\r\nlittle higher on his pillows.\r\n\r\n“Since when,” he asked of all the world, “has a Woodville refused to\r\npay his debts? Since when has a Woodville refused asylum to one who\r\nprotected him and his in the hour of danger? Margaret, lift the blanket\r\nand invite our young friend in.”\r\n\r\nDick was on his feet in an instant, and came into the chamber, uttering\r\nthanks to the man who, in spite of so much bitterness against his cause,\r\ncould yet shelter him.\r\n\r\nYoung Woodville exclaimed in surprise.\r\n\r\n“The Yankee with whom I fought at Bellevue!” he said.\r\n\r\n“And the one who ignored your presence at Jackson,” said Miss Woodville.\r\n\r\nThe two lads shook hands.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Colonel Woodville, his old sharpness returning,\r\n“we shall be on even terms, young sir. Your uniform bears a faint\r\nresemblance to that of your own army, and Slade, cunning and cruel, may\r\nhave had you shot as a spy. You would be taken within our lines and this\r\nis no time for long examinations.”\r\n\r\n“I know how much I owe you, sir,” said Dick, “and I know how much danger\r\nmy presence here brings upon you. I will leave as soon as the ravine is\r\nclear. The gathering of the troops for battle will give me a chance.”\r\n\r\n“You will do nothing of the kind. Having begun the task we will carry it\r\nthrough. Our cave home rambles. There is a little apartment belonging\r\nto Victor, in which you may put yourself in shape. I advise you to lie\r\nquiet here for a day or two, and then if I am still able to put my hand\r\non you I may turn you over with full explanations to the authorities.”\r\n\r\nDick noted the significance of the words, “if I am still able to put my\r\nhand on you,” but he merely spoke of his gratitude and went with young\r\nWoodville into the little apartment. It was on the right side of the\r\nhall, and a round shutterless hole opened into the ravine, admitting\r\nlight and air. The “window,” which was not more than a foot in diameter\r\nfaced toward the east and gave a view of earthworks, and the region\r\nbeyond, where the Union army stood.\r\n\r\nThe room itself contained but little, a cot, some blankets, clothing,\r\nand articles of the toilet.\r\n\r\n“Mason,” said Woodville, “make yourself as comfortable as you can here.\r\nI did not know until I escaped from Jackson that it was you who ignored\r\nmy presence there. You seem in some manner to have won the good opinion\r\nof my uncle, and, in any event, he could not bear to remain in debt to a\r\nYankee. If you're careful you're safe here for the day, although you may\r\nbe lonesome. I must go at once to our lines. Cousin Margaret will bring\r\nyou something to eat.”\r\n\r\nThey shook hands again.\r\n\r\n“I can't do much fighting,” said Woodville, “owing to this wounded arm\r\nof mine, but I can carry messages, and the line is so long many are to\r\nbe taken.”\r\n\r\nHe went out and Miss Woodville came soon with food on a tray. Dick\r\nsuspected that they could ill spare it, but he must eat and he feared to\r\noffer pay. It embarrassed him, too, that she should wait upon him, but,\r\nin their situation, it was absolutely necessary that she do so, even\r\nwere there a servant somewhere, which he doubted. But she left the tray,\r\nand when she returned for it an hour later she had only a few words to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nDick stood at the round hole that served as a window. There were\r\nbushes about it, and, at that point, the cliff seemed to be almost\r\nperpendicular. He was safe from observation and he looked over a\r\nvast expanse of country. The morning was dazzlingly clear, and he saw\r\nsections of the Confederate earthworks with their men and guns, and far\r\nbeyond them other earthworks and other guns, which he knew were those of\r\nhis own people.\r\n\r\nWhile he stood there alone, free from the tension that had lasted\r\nwhile Slade was present, he realized the great volume of fire that the\r\nNorthern cannon were pouring without ceasing upon Vicksburg. The deep\r\nrumble was continually in his ears, and at times his imagination made\r\nthe earth shake. He saw two shells burst in the air, and a shattering\r\nexplosion told that a third struck near by. To the eastward smoke was\r\nalways drifting. The Southern cannon seldom replied.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to attempt escape during the coming night. It hurt him to\r\nbring danger upon the Woodvilles and he wished, too, to fulfill his\r\nmission. Others, beyond question, would reach the fleet with the\r\nmessage, but he wished to reach it also.\r\n\r\nYet nothing new occurred during all the long day. Miss Woodville brought\r\nhim more food at noon, but scarcely spoke. Then he returned to the hole\r\nin the cliff, and remained there until twilight. Young Woodville\r\ncame, and he gathered from his manner that there had been no important\r\nmovement of the armies, that all as yet was preparation. But he inferred\r\nthat the storm was coming, and he told Victor that he meant to leave\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nHe was opposed vehemently. The line of Southern sentinels watched\r\neverywhere. Slade was most vigilant. He might come at any time into the\r\nravine. No, he must wait. The next night, perhaps, but in any event he\r\nmust remain a while.\r\n\r\nNor did he depart the next night either. Instead, two or three days\r\npassed, and he was still in the house dug in the hillside, a guest and\r\nyet a captive. The bombardment had gone on, his food was still brought\r\nto him by Miss Woodville, and once or twice Victor came, but Dick, as he\r\nwas in honor bound, asked him no question about the armies.\r\n\r\nThe waiting, the loneliness and the suspense were terrible to one so\r\nyoung, and so ambitious. And yet he had fared better than he had a right\r\nto expect, a fact, however, that did not relieve his situation.\r\n\r\nAnother night came, and he went to sleep in his lonely cell in the wall,\r\nbut he was awakened while it was yet intensely dark by a cannonade far\r\nsurpassing in violence any that had gone before. He rushed to the hole,\r\nbut he could see nothing in the ravine. Yet the whole plateau seemed to\r\nshake with the violence of the concussions and the crash of exploding\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nThe fire came from all sides, from the river as well as the land. The\r\nboom of the huge mortars on the boats there sounded above everything.\r\nDick knew absolutely now that the message he was to carry had been\r\ndelivered by somebody else.\r\n\r\nHe heard under the continued thunder of the guns sharp commands, and the\r\ntread of many troops moving. He knew that the Southern forces were going\r\ninto position, and he felt himself that the tremendous fire was the\r\nprelude to a great attack. His excitement grew. He strained his eyes,\r\nbut he could see nothing in the dark ravine, or out there where the\r\ncannon roared, save the rapid, red flashes under the dim horizon. He had\r\nhis watch and he had kept it running. Now he was able to make out that\r\nit was only three o'clock in the morning. A long time until day and\r\nhe must wait until then to know what such a furious convulsion would\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\nThe slow time passed, and there was no decrease of the fire. Once or\r\ntwice he came away from the window and listened at the entrance to his\r\nlittle room, but he could hear nothing stirring in the larger chamber.\r\nYet it was incredible that Colonel Woodville and his daughter should not\r\nbe awake. They would certainly be listening with an anxiety and suspense\r\nnot less than his.\r\n\r\nDawn came after painful ages, and slowly the region out there where the\r\nUnion army lay rose into the light. But it was a red dawn, a dawn in\r\nflame and smoke. Scores of guns crashed in front, and behind the heavy\r\nbooming of the mortars on the boats formed the overnote of the storm.\r\n\r\nThe opening was not large, but it afforded the lad a good view, and he\r\nthrust his head out as far as he could, every nerve in him leaping at\r\nthe deep roar of the cannonade. He had no doubt that the assault was\r\nabout to be made. He was wild with eagerness to see it, and it was a\r\ncruel hurt to his spirit that he was held there, and could not take a\r\npart in it.\r\n\r\nHe thought of rushing from the place, and of seeking a way through the\r\nlines to his own army, but a little reflection showed him that it would\r\nbe folly. He must merely be a witness, while Colonel Winchester, Warner,\r\nPennington, the sergeant, Colonel Hertford, all whom he knew and the\r\ntens of thousands whom he did not know, fought the battle.\r\n\r\nA tremendous sound, distant and steady, would not blot out much smaller\r\nsounds nearby, and now he heard noises in the larger chamber. The voice\r\nof Colonel Woodville was raised in sharp command.\r\n\r\n“Lift me up!” he said, “I must see! Must I lie here, eating my soul out,\r\nwhen a great battle is going on! Help me up, I say! Wound or no wound, I\r\nwill go to the door!”\r\n\r\nThen the voice of Miss Woodville attempting to soothe was heard, but\r\nthe colonel broke forth more furiously than ever, not at her, but at his\r\nunhappy fate.\r\n\r\nDick, spurred by impulse, left his alcove and entered the room.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he said respectfully to Colonel Woodville, “you are eager to see,\r\nand so am I. May I help you?”\r\n\r\nColonel Woodville turned a red eye upon him.\r\n\r\n“Young man,” he said, “you have shown before a sense of fitness, and\r\nyour appearance now is most welcome. You shall help me to the door,\r\nand I will lean upon you. Together we will see what is going to happen,\r\nalthough I wish for one result, and you for another. No, Margaret, it\r\nis not worth while to protest any further. My young Yankee and I will\r\nmanage it very well between us.”\r\n\r\nMiss Woodville stepped aside and smiled wanly.\r\n\r\n“I think it is best, Miss Woodville,” Dick said in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” she replied.\r\n\r\nColonel Woodville impatiently threw off the cover. He wore a long purple\r\ndressing gown, and his wound was in the leg, but it was partly healed.\r\nDick helped him out of the bed and then supported him with his arm under\r\nhis shoulder. Within that singular abode the roar of the guns was a\r\nsteady and sinister mutter, but beneath it now appeared another note.\r\n\r\nColonel Woodville had begun to swear. It was not the torrent of loud\r\nimprecation that Dick had heard in Jackson, but subdued, and all the\r\nmore fierce because it was so like the ferocious whine of a powerful and\r\nhurt wild animal. Swearing was common enough among the older men of the\r\nSouth, even among the educated, but Colonel Woodville now surpassed them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nDick heard oaths, ripe and rich, entirely new to him, and he heard the\r\nold ones in new arrangements and with new inflections. And yet there was\r\nno blasphemy about it. It seemed a part of time and place, and, what was\r\nmore, it seemed natural coming from the lips of the old colonel.\r\n\r\nThey reached the door, the cut in the side of the ravine, and at once a\r\nwide portion of the battlefield sprang into the light, while the roar\r\nof the guns was redoubled. Dick would have stepped back now, but Colonel\r\nWoodville's hand rested on his shoulder and his support was needed.\r\n\r\n“My glasses, Margaret!” said the colonel. “I must see! I will see! If\r\nI am but an old hound, lying here while the pack is in full cry, I will\r\nnevertheless see the chase! And even if I am an old hound I could run\r\nwith the best of them if that infernal Yankee bullet had not taken me in\r\nthe leg!”\r\n\r\nMiss Woodville brought him the glasses, a powerful pair, and he glued\r\nthem instantly to his eyes. Dick saw only the field of battle, dark\r\nlines and blurs, the red flare of cannon and rifle fire, and towers and\r\nbanks of smoke, but the colonel saw individual human beings, and, with\r\nhis trained military eye, he knew what the movements meant. Dick felt\r\nthe hand upon his shoulder trembling with excitement. He was excited\r\nhimself. Miss Woodville stood just behind them, and a faint tinge of\r\ncolor appeared in her pale face.\r\n\r\n“The Yankees are getting ready to charge,” said the colonel. “At the\r\npoint we see they will not yet rush forward. They will, of course, wait\r\nfor a preconcerted signal, and then their whole army will attack at\r\nonce. But the woods and ravines are filled with their skirmishers,\r\ntrying to clear the way. I can see them in hundreds and hundreds, and\r\ntheir rifles make sheets of flame. All the time the cannon are firing\r\nover their heads. Heavens, what a bombardment! I've never before\r\nlistened to its like!”\r\n\r\n“What are our troops doing, father?” asked Miss Woodville.\r\n\r\n“Very little yet, and they should do little. Pemberton is showing more\r\njudgment than I expected of him. The defense should hold its fire until\r\nthe enemy is well within range and that's what we're doing!”\r\n\r\nThe colonel leaned a little more heavily upon him, but Dick steadied\r\nhimself. The old man still kept the glasses to his eyes, and swept them\r\nback and forth in as wide an arc as their position permitted. The hills\r\nshook with the thunder of the cannon, and the brilliant sun, piercing\r\nthrough the smoke, lighted up the vast battle line.\r\n\r\n“The attack of the skirmishers grows hotter,” said the old man. “The\r\nthickets blaze with the fire of their rifles. Heavy masses of infantry\r\nare moving forward. Now they stop and lie on their arms. They are\r\nawaiting the word from other parts of the field, and it shows with\r\ncertainty that a grand attack is coming. Two batteries of eight guns\r\neach have come nearer. I did not think it possible for the fire of their\r\ncannon to increase, but it has done so. Young sir, would you care to\r\nlook through the glasses?”\r\n\r\n“I believe not, Colonel. I will trust to the naked eye and your report.”\r\n\r\nIt was an odd feeling that made Dick decline the glasses. If he looked\r\nhe must tell to the others what he saw, and he wished to show neither\r\nexultation nor depression. The colonel, the duty of courtesy discharged,\r\nresumed his own position of witness and herald.\r\n\r\n“The columns of infantry are getting up again,” he said. “I see a man in\r\nwhat I take to be a general's uniform riding along their front. He\r\nmust be making a speech. No doubt he knows the desperate nature of\r\nthe attack, and would inspire them. Now he is gone and other officers,\r\ncolonels and majors are moving about.”\r\n\r\n“What are the skirmishers doing, Colonel?”\r\n\r\n“Their fire is not so hot. They must be drawing back. They have made\r\nthe prelude, and the importance of their role has passed. The masses\r\nof infantry are drawing together again. Now I see men on horseback with\r\ntrumpets to their lips. Yes, the charge is coming. Ah-h! That burnt\r\nthem!”\r\n\r\nThere was a terrific crash much nearer, and Dick knew that it was the\r\nSouthern batteries opening fire. The shoulder upon which the colonel's\r\nhand rested shook a little, but it was from excitement. He said nothing\r\nand Colonel Woodville continued:\r\n\r\n“The smoke is so heavy I can't see what damage was done! Now it has\r\ncleared away! There are gaps in the Yankee lines, but the men have\r\nclosed up, and they come on at the double quick with their cannon still\r\nfiring over their heads!”\r\n\r\nIn his excitement he took his hand off Dick's shoulder and leaned\r\nforward a little farther, supporting himself now against the earthen\r\nwall. Dick stood just behind him, shielded from the sight of any one\r\nwho might be passing in the ravine, although there was little danger now\r\nfrom searchers with a great battle going on. Meanwhile he watched the\r\ncombat with an eagerness fully equal to that of the old colonel.\r\n\r\nThe mighty crash of cannon and rifles together continued, but for a\r\nlittle while the smoke banked up in front so densely that the whole\r\ncombat was hidden from them. Then a wind slowly rolled the smoke away.\r\nThe figures of the men began to appear like shadowy tracery, and then\r\nemerged, distinct and separate from the haze.\r\n\r\n“They are nearer now,” said the Colonel. “I can plainly see their long\r\nlines moving and their light guns coming with them. But our batteries\r\nare raking them horribly. Their men are falling by the scores and\r\nhundreds.”\r\n\r\nMiss Woodville uttered a deep sigh and turned her face away. But she\r\nlooked again in a few moments. The terrible spell was upon her, too.\r\n\r\nDick's nerves were quivering. His heart was with the assailants and\r\ntheirs with the assailed, but he would not speak aloud against the hopes\r\nof Colonel Woodville and his daughter, since he was in their house, such\r\nas it was, and, in a measure, under their protection.\r\n\r\n“Their charge is splendid,” continued the colonel, “and I hope Pemberton\r\nhas made full use of the ground for defense! He will need all the help\r\nhe can get! Oh, to be out of the battle on such a day! The smoke is in\r\nthe way again and I can see nothing. Now it has passed and the enemy is\r\nstill advancing, but our fire grows hotter and hotter! The shells and\r\nthe grape and the canister and the bullets are smashing through them.\r\nThey cannot live under it! They must go back!”\r\n\r\nNevertheless the blue lines came steadily toward the Southern\r\nearthworks. Dick saw officers, some ahorse, and some afoot, rushing\r\nabout and encouraging the men, and he saw many fall and lie still while\r\nthe regiments passed on.\r\n\r\n“They are in the nearer thickets,” cried the colonel, “and now they're\r\nclimbing the slopes! Ah, you riflemen, your target is there!”\r\n\r\nThe Northern army was so near now that the Southern rifle fire was\r\nbeating upon it like a storm. Never flinching, the men of the west and\r\nnorthwest hurled themselves upon the powerful fortified positions. Some\r\nreached shelves of the plateau almost at the mouths of the guns and hung\r\nthere, their comrades falling dead or dying around them, but now the\r\nrebel yell began to swell along the vast line, and reached the ears of\r\nthose in the ravine.\r\n\r\n“The omen of victory!” exclaimed the colonel exultantly. “Our brave lads\r\nfeel that they're about to triumph! Grant can't break through our line!\r\nWhy doesn't he call off his men? It's slaughter!”\r\n\r\nDick's heart sank. He knew that the colonel's words were true. The\r\nSouthern army, posted in its defenses, was breaking the ring of steel\r\nthat sought to crush it to death. Groups of men in blue who had seized\r\nground in the very front of the defenses either died there or were\r\ngradually driven back. The inner ring along its front of miles thundered\r\nincessantly on the outer ring, and repelled every attempt to crush it.\r\n\r\n“They yield,” said the colonel, after a long time. “The Northern fire\r\nhas sunk at many points, and there! and there! they're retreating! The\r\nattack has failed and the South has won a victory!”\r\n\r\n“But Grant will come again,” said Dick, speaking his opinion for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n“No doubt of it,” said Colonel Woodville, “but likely he will come to\r\nthe same fate.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke wholly without animosity. The battle now died fast. The men\r\nin gray had been invincible. Their cannon and rifles had made an\r\nimpenetrable barrier of fire, and Grant, despite the valor of his\r\ntroops, had been forced to draw off. Many thousands had fallen and the\r\nSouthern generals were exultant. Johnston would come up, and Grant,\r\nhaving such heavy losses, would be unable to withstand the united\r\nConfederate armies.\r\n\r\nBut Grant, as Colonel Woodville foresaw, had no idea of retreating.\r\nFresh troops were pouring down the great river for him, and while he\r\nwould not again attempt to storm Vicksburg, the ring of steel around it\r\nwould be made so broad and strong that Pemberton could not get out nor\r\ncould Johnston get in.\r\n\r\nWhen the last cannon shot echoed over the far hills Colonel Woodville\r\nturned away from the door of his hillside home.\r\n\r\n“I must ask your shoulder again, young sir,” he said to Dick. “What I\r\nhave seen rejoices me greatly, but I do not say it to taunt you. In\r\nwar if one wins the other must lose, and bear in mind that you are the\r\ninvader.”\r\n\r\n“May I help you back to your bed, sir?” asked Dick.\r\n\r\n“You may. You are a good young man. I'm glad I saved you from that\r\nscoundrel, Slade. As the score between us is even I wish that you were\r\nout of Vicksburg and with your own people.”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking, too, sir, that I ought to go. I may take a quick\r\ndeparture.”\r\n\r\n“Then if you do go I wish you a speedy and safe journey, but I tell you\r\nto beware of one, Slade, who has a malicious heart and a long memory.”\r\n\r\nDick withdrew to his own cell, as he called it, and he passed bitter\r\nhours there. The repulse had struck him a hard blow. Was it possible\r\nthat Grant could not win? And if he could not win what terrible risks\r\nhe would run in the heart of the Confederacy, with perhaps two armies to\r\nfight! He felt that only the Mississippi, that life-line connecting him\r\nwith the North, could save him.\r\n\r\nBut as dusk came gradually in the ravine he resolved that he would go.\r\nHis supper, as usual, was brought to him by Miss Woodville. She was as\r\ntaciturn as ever, speaking scarcely a half-dozen words. When he asked\r\nher if Victor had gone through the battle unharmed she merely nodded,\r\nand presently he was alone again, with the dusk deepening in the great\r\ngully.\r\n\r\nDick was confident that nobody but Colonel Woodville, his daughter, and\r\nhimself were in the cave-home. It was but a small place, and new callous\r\nplaces on her hands indicated that she was doing the cooking and all\r\nother work. His resolve to risk everything and go was strengthened.\r\n\r\nHe waited patiently until the full night had come and only the usual\r\nsounds of an army in camp arose. Then he made ready. He had surrendered\r\nhis holster and pistols to Colonel Woodville, and so he must issue forth\r\nunarmed, but it could not be helped. He had several ten dollar gold\r\npieces in his pocket, and he put one of them on the tiny table in his\r\ncell. He knew that it would be most welcome, and he could not calculate\r\nhow many hundreds in Confederacy currency it was worth. He was glad that\r\nhe could repay a little at least.\r\n\r\nThen he stepped lightly toward the larger chamber in which Colonel\r\nWoodville lay. The usual candle was burning on the table near his bed,\r\nbut the great bald head lay motionless on the pillow, and the heavy\r\nwhite eyebrows drooped over closed lids. Sound asleep! Dick was glad\r\nof it. The colonel, with his strong loyalty to the South, might seek\r\nto hold him, at least as his personal prisoner, and now the trouble was\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nHe moved gently across the floor, and then passed toward the open door.\r\nHow good that puff of fresh air and freedom felt on his face! He did not\r\nknow that Colonel Woodville raised his head on the pillow, glanced after\r\nhim, and then let his head sink back and his eyes close again. A low\r\nsigh came between the colonel's lips, and it would have been difficult\r\nto say whether it was relief or regret.\r\n\r\nDick stepped into the narrow path cut in the side of the ravine and\r\ninhaled more draughts of the fresh air. How sweet and strong it was! How\r\nit filled one's lungs and brought with it life, courage and confidence!\r\nOne had to live in a hole in a hill before he could appreciate fully the\r\nblessed winds that blew about the world. He knew that the path ran\r\nin front of other hollows dug in the earth, and he felt sorry for the\r\npeople who were compelled to burrow in them. He felt sorry, in truth,\r\nfor all Vicksburg, because now that he was outside his fears for Grant\r\ndisappeared, and he knew that he must win.\r\n\r\nWhile he remained in the path a deep boom came from the direction of the\r\nUnion army and a huge shell burst over the town. It was followed in a\r\nmoment by another and then by many others. While the besieged rejoiced\r\nin victory the besiegers had begun anew the terrible bombardment,\r\nsending a warning that the iron ring still held.\r\n\r\nDick paused no longer, but ran rapidly along the path until he emerged\r\nupon the open plateau and proceeded toward the center of the town. He\r\njudged that in the hours following a great battle, while there was yet\r\nmuch confusion, he would find his best chance.\r\n\r\nHe had reckoned rightly. There was a great passing to and fro in\r\nVicksburg, but its lights were dim. Oil and candles alike were scarce,\r\nand there was little but the moon's rays to disclose a town to the eye.\r\nThe rejoicings over the victory had brought more people than usual into\r\nthe streets, but the same exultation made them unsuspicious, and Dick\r\nglided among them in the dusk, almost without fear.\r\n\r\nHe had concluded that “the longest way around was the shortest way\r\nthrough,” and he directed his steps toward the river. He had formed a\r\nclear plan at last, and he believed that it would succeed. Twisting and\r\nturning, always keeping in the shadows, he made good progress, descended\r\nthe bluff, and at last stood behind the ruins of an old warehouse near\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\nSouthern batteries were not far away from him and he heard the men\r\ntalking. Then, strengthening his resolution, he came from behind the\r\nruins, flung himself almost flat on the ground, and crawled toward the\r\nriver, pushing in front of him a board, which some Northern gun had shot\r\nfrom the warehouse.\r\n\r\nHe knew that his task was difficult and dangerous, though in the last\r\nresort he could rush to the water and spring in. But he was almost\r\nat the edge before any sentinel saw the black shadow passing over the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nA hail came, and Dick flattened himself against the ground and lay\r\nperfectly still. Evidently the sentinel was satisfied that his fancy had\r\nbeen making merry with him, as he did not look further at the shadow,\r\nand Dick, after waiting two or three minutes, resumed his slow creeping.\r\n\r\nHe reached the edge, shoved the board into it, and dropped gently into\r\nthe water beside it, submerged to the head. Then, pushing his support\r\nbefore him, he struck out for the middle of the stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. THE TAKING OF VICKSBURG\r\n\r\n\r\nDick was a fine swimmer, he had a good stout plank, and the waters of\r\nthe river were warm. He felt that the chief dangers were passed, and\r\nthat the muddy Mississippi would now bear him safely to the blockading\r\nfleet below. He gave the plank another shove, sending it farther out\r\ninto the stream, and then raised himself up until his elbows rested upon\r\nit. He could thus float gently with a little propulsion from his legs to\r\nthe place where he wanted to go.\r\n\r\nHe saw lights along the bluff and the bar below, and then, with a sudden\r\nshoot of alarm he noticed a dim shadow move slowly from the shore. It\r\nwas a long boat, holding a dozen rowers, and several men armed with\r\nrifles, and it was coming toward him. He did not know whether it was\r\nmerely an ordinary patrol, or whether they had seen the darker blot on\r\nthe stream that he and the plank made, but in any event the result would\r\nbe the same.\r\n\r\nHe slipped his arm off the plank and sank in the stream to the chin.\r\nThen, propelling it gently and without any splashing of the water, he\r\ncontinued to move down the stream. He was hopeful that the riflemen\r\nwould mistake him and his plank for one of those stumps or logs which\r\nthe Mississippi carries so often on its bosom.\r\n\r\nThe head of the boat turned from him a little, and he felt sure now that\r\nhe would drift away unnoticed, but one of the soldiers suddenly raised\r\nhis rifle and fired. Dick heard the bullet clip the water close beside\r\nhim, and he swam as hard as he could for a few moments. Then he\r\nsettled again into quiet, as he saw the boat was not coming toward him.\r\nDoubtless the man had merely fired the shot to satisfy himself that it\r\nwas really a log, and if Dick allowed it to float naturally he would be\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\nIt was a tremendous trial of nerves to run the gantlet in this way, but\r\nas it was that or nothing he exerted all his will upon his body, and let\r\nhimself float slowly, sunk again to the mouth and with his head thrown\r\nback, so it would present only a few inches above the surface.\r\n\r\nThe boat turned, and seemed once upon the point of coming toward him. He\r\ncould hear the creaking of the oars and the men talking, but they turned\r\nagain suddenly and rowed up the stream. Again, his fate had hung on a\r\nchance impulse. He drifted slowly on until the town and the bluffs sank\r\nin the darkness. Then he drew himself upon his plank and swam, doubling\r\nhis speed. He knew that some of the Union gunboats lay not far below,\r\nand, when he rounded a curve, he saw a light in the stream, but near the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nHe approached cautiously, knowing that the men on the vessel would be on\r\nguard against secret attack, and presently he discerned the outlines\r\nof a sidewheel steamer, converted into a warship and bearing guns. He\r\ndropped down by the side of his plank until he was quite close, and\r\nthen, raising himself upon it again, he shouted with all his voice:\r\n“Ship ahoy!”\r\n\r\nHe did not know whether that was the customary method of hailing on the\r\nMississippi, but it was a memory from his nautical reading, and so he\r\nshouted a second and yet a third time at the top of his voice: “Ship\r\nahoy!” Figures bearing rifles appeared at the side, and a rough voice\r\ndemanded in language highly unparliamentary who was there and what he,\r\nshe or it wanted.\r\n\r\nDick was in a genial mood. He had escaped with an ease that surprised\r\nhim, and the warmth of the water in which he was immersed had saved him\r\nfrom cramp or chill. The spirit of recklessness seized him again. He\r\nthrew himself astride his plank, and called out:\r\n\r\n“A detachment of the army of the United States escaped from captivity in\r\nVicksburg, and wishing to rejoin it. It's infantry, not marines, and it\r\nneeds land.”\r\n\r\n“Then advance infantry and give the countersign.”\r\n\r\n“Grant and Victory,” replied Dick in a loud, clear voice.\r\n\r\nA laugh came from the steamer, and the rough voice said again:\r\n\r\n“Let the detachment advance again, and holding up its hands, show\r\nitself.”\r\n\r\nDick paddled closer and, steadying himself as well as he could, threw\r\nup his hands. The light of a ship's lantern was thrown directly on his\r\nface, and the same voice ordered men to take a small boat and get him.\r\n\r\nWhen Dick stepped upon the deck of the steamer, water streaming from\r\nhis clothes, several men looked at him curiously. One in a dingy blue\r\nuniform he believed to be the owner of the rough voice. But his face was\r\nnot rough.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” asked the man.\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant Richard Mason of Colonel Winchester's regiment in the army\r\nof General Grant, sent several days ago with a message to the fleet, but\r\ndriven by Confederate scouts and skirmishers into Vicksburg, where he\r\nlay hidden, seeking a chance of escape.”\r\n\r\n“And he found it to-night, coming down the river like a big catfish.”\r\n\r\n“He did, sir. He could find no other way, and he arrived on the useful\r\nboard which is now floating away on the current.”\r\n\r\n“What proof have you that you are what you say.”\r\n\r\n“That I saw you before you saw me and hailed you.”\r\n\r\n“It's not enough.”\r\n\r\n“Then here is the message that I was to have delivered to the commander\r\nof the fleet. It's pretty wet, but I think you can make it out.”\r\n\r\nHe drew the dispatch from the inside pocket of his waistcoat. It was\r\nsoaked through, but when they turned the ship's lantern upon it the\r\ncaptain could make out its tenor and the names. Doubt could exist no\r\nlonger and he clapped his hands heartily upon the lad's shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Come into the cabin and have something to eat and dry clothes,” he\r\nsaid. “This is the converted steamer Union, and I'm its commander,\r\nCaptain William Hays. I judge that you've had an extraordinary time.”\r\n\r\n“I have, captain, and the hardest of it all was when I saw our army\r\nrepulsed to-day.”\r\n\r\n“It was bad and the wounded are still lying on the field, but it doesn't\r\nmean that Vicksburg will have a single moment of rest. Listen to that,\r\nwill you, lieutenant?”\r\n\r\nThe far boom of a cannon came, and Dick knew that its shell would break\r\nover the unhappy town. But he had grown so used to the cannonade that\r\nit made little impression upon him, and, shrugging his shoulders, he\r\ndescended the gangway with the captain.\r\n\r\nClothing that would fit him well enough was found, and once more he was\r\ndry and warm. Hot coffee and good food were brought him, and while he\r\nate and drank Captain Hays asked him many questions. What was the rebel\r\nstrength in Vicksburg? Were they exultant over their victory of the day?\r\nDid they think they could hold out? What food supply did they have?\r\n\r\nDick answered all the questions openly and frankly as far as he could.\r\nHe really knew little or nothing about those of importance, and, as for\r\nhimself, he merely said that he had hid in a cave, many of which had\r\nbeen dug in Vicksburg. He did not mention Colonel Woodville or his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Captain Hays, when he finished his supper, “you can have\r\na bunk. Yes, lieutenant, you must take it. I could put you ashore\r\nto-night, but it's not worth while. Get a good night's sleep, and we'll\r\nsee to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nDick knew that he was right, and, quelling his impatience, he lay down\r\nin one of the bunks and slept until morning.\r\n\r\nThen, after a solid breakfast, he went ashore with the good wishes of\r\nCaptain Hays, and, a few hours later, he was with the Union army and his\r\nown regiment. Again he was welcomed as one dead and his own heart was\r\nfull of rejoicing because all of his friends were alive. Warner alone\r\nhad been wounded, a bullet cutting into his shoulder, but not hurting\r\nhim much. He wore a bandage, his face had a becoming pallor, and\r\nPennington charged that he was making the most of it.\r\n\r\n“But it was an awful day,” said Warner, “and there's a lot of gloom\r\nin the camp. Still, we're not moving away and the reinforcements are\r\ncoming.”\r\n\r\nDick explained to Colonel Winchester why he had failed in his mission,\r\nand the colonel promised to report in turn to the commander that the\r\nhand of God had intervened. Dick's conscience was now at rest, and he\r\nresumed at once his duties with the regiment.\r\n\r\nMany days passed. While Grant did not make any other attack upon\r\nVicksburg his circle of steel grew tighter, and the rain of shells and\r\nbombs upon the devoted town never ceased. Reinforcements poured forward.\r\nHis army rose to nearly eighty thousand men, and Johnston, hovering\r\nnear, gathering together what men he could, did not dare to strike. Dick\r\nwas reminded more than once of Caesar's famous siege of Alesia, about\r\nwhich he had read not so long ago in Dr. Russell's academy at Pendleton.\r\n\r\nThere were long, long days of intrenching, skirmishing and idleness. May\r\nturned into June, and still the steel coil enclosed Vicksburg. Here the\r\nUnion men were hopeful, but the news from the East was bad. Not much\r\nfiltered through, and none of it struck a happy note. Lee, with\r\nhis invincible legions, was still sweeping northward. Doubtless the\r\nConfederate hosts now trod the soil of a free State, and Dick and his\r\ncomrades feared in their very souls that Lee was marching to another\r\ngreat victory.\r\n\r\n“I wish I could hear from Harry Kenton,” said Dick to Warner. “I'd like\r\nto know whether he passed through Chancellorsville safely.”\r\n\r\n“Don't you worry about him,” said Warner. “That rebel cousin of yours\r\nhas luck. He also has skill. Let x equal luck and y skill. Now x plus y\r\nequals the combination of luck and skill, which is safety. That\r\nproves to me mathematically that he is unharmed and that he is riding\r\nnorthward--to defeat, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“We've got to win here,” said Dick. “If we don't, I'm thinking the\r\ncause of the Union will be more than doubtful. We don't seem to have the\r\ngenerals in the East that we have in the West. Our leaders hang on here\r\nand they don't overestimate the enemy.”\r\n\r\n“That's so,” said Pennington. “Now, I wonder what 'Pap' Thomas is\r\ndoing.”\r\n\r\n“He's somewhere in Tennessee, I suppose, watching Bragg,” said Dick.\r\n“That's a man I like, and, I think, after this affair here is over, we\r\nmay go back to his command. If we do succeed in taking Vicksburg,\r\nit seems likely to me that the heavy fighting will be up there in\r\nTennessee, where Bragg's army is.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know if your uncle, Colonel Kenton, is in Vicksburg?”\r\n\r\n“I don't think so. In fact, I'm sure he isn't. His regiment is with\r\nBragg. Well, George, what does your algebra tell us?”\r\n\r\nWarner had taken out his little volume again and was studying it\r\nintently. But he raised his head long enough to reply.\r\n\r\n“I have just achieved the solution of a very important mathematical\r\nproblem,” he answered in precise tones. “An army of about thirty-five\r\nthousand men occupies a town located on a river. It is besieged by\r\nanother army of about seventy-five thousand men flushed with victory.\r\nThe besiegers occupy the river with a strong fleet. They are also led\r\nby a general who has shown skill and extraordinary tenacity, while the\r\ncommander of the besieged has not shown much of either quality and must\r\nfeel great discouragement.”\r\n\r\n“But you're only stating the side of the besieged.”\r\n\r\n“Don't interrupt. It's impolite. I mean to be thoroughly fair. Now\r\ncome the factors favoring the besieged. The assailing army, despite its\r\nsuperior numbers, is far in the enemy's country. It may be attacked at\r\nany time by another army outside, small, but led by a very able general.\r\nNow, you have both sides presented to you, but I have already arrived at\r\nthe determining factor. What would you say it is, Dick?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know.”\r\n\r\n“You haven't used your reasoning powers. Remember that the man who not\r\nmerely thinks, but who thinks hard and continuously always wins. It's\r\nvery simple. The answer is in four letters, f-o-o-d, food. As we know\r\npositively, Pemberton was able to provision Vicksburg for five or\r\nsix weeks. We can't break in and he can't break out. When his food\r\nis exhausted, as it soon will be, he'll have to give up. The siege of\r\nVicksburg is over. I know everything, except the exact date.”\r\n\r\nDick was inclined to believe that Warner was right, but he forgot about\r\nhis prediction, because a mail came down the river that afternoon, and\r\nhe received a letter from his mother, his beautiful young mother, who\r\noften seemed just like an elder sister.\r\n\r\nShe was in Pendleton, she wrote, staying comfortably in their home. The\r\ntown was occupied by three companies of veteran Union troops who behaved\r\nwell. They were always glad to have a garrison of good soldiers whether\r\nFederal or Confederate--sometimes it was one and sometimes the other.\r\nBut she thought the present Union force would remain quite a while, as\r\nshe did not look for the reappearance of the Southern army in Kentucky.\r\nBut if the town were left without troops she would go back to her\r\nrelatives in the Bluegrass, as Bill Skelly's band to the eastward in\r\nthe mountains was raiding and plundering and had become a great menace.\r\nGuerillas were increasing in numbers in those doubtful regions.\r\n\r\n“The regular troops will have to deal with those fellows later on,” said\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Russell has had a letter from Harry Kenton,” continued Mrs. Mason.\r\n“It was written from some point near the Pennsylvania line, and, while\r\nHarry did not say so in his letter, I know that General Lee is expecting\r\na great victory in the North. Harry was not hurt at Chancellorsville,\r\nbut he says he does not see how he escaped, the fire of the cannon and\r\nrifles being more awful than any that he had ever seen before. He was\r\npresent when General Jackson was mortally wounded, and he seems to have\r\nbeen deeply affected by it. He writes that the Confederacy could better\r\nhave lost a hundred thousand men.”\r\n\r\nThere was more in the letter, but it was strictly personal to Dick, and\r\nit closed with her heartfelt prayer that God, who had led him safely so\r\nfar, would lead him safely through all.\r\n\r\nAfter reading it several times he put it in a hidden pocket. Soldiers\r\ndid not receive many letters and they always treasured them. Ah, his\r\ndear, beautiful young mother! How could anyone ever harm her! Yet the\r\nthought of Skelly and his outlaws made him uneasy. He hoped that the\r\nUnion garrison would remain in Pendleton permanently.\r\n\r\nHis mind was soon compelled to turn back to the siege. They were digging\r\ntrenches and creeping closer and closer. Warner had made no mistake\r\nin his mathematics. The army and the people in Vicksburg had begun to\r\nsuffer from a lack of food. They were down to half rations. They had\r\nneither tea nor coffee, and medicines were exhausted. Many and many a\r\ntime they looked forth from their hills and prayed for Johnston, but he\r\ncould not come. Always the Union flag floated before them, and the ring\r\nof steel so strong and broad was contracting inch by inch.\r\n\r\nThe Northern engineers ran mines under the Confederate works. They used\r\nevery device of ingenious minds to push the siege. Spies brought word\r\nthat all food would soon be gone in Vicksburg, and Grant, grim of\r\npurpose, took another hitch in the steel belt about the hopeless town.\r\nThe hostile earthworks and trenches were now so near that the men could\r\nhear one another talking. Sometimes in a lull of the firing they\r\nwould come out and exchange tobacco or news. It was impossible for the\r\nofficers to prevent it, and they really did not seek to do so, as the\r\nmen fought just as well when they returned to their works.\r\n\r\nJune now drew to a close and the great heats of July were at hand. Dick\r\nwas convinced that the defense of Vicksburg was drawing to a like close.\r\nThey had proof that some of the irregulars in Vicksburg had escaped\r\nthrough the lines and he was convinced that Slade would be among them.\r\nThey were the rats and Vicksburg was the sinking ship.\r\n\r\nThey heard that Johnston had gathered together twenty-five thousand men\r\nand was at last marching to the relief of the town. Dick believed that\r\nGrant must have laughed one of his grimmest laughs. They knew that\r\nJohnston's men were worn and half-starved, and had been harassed by\r\nother Union troops. Johnston was skillful, but he would only be a lean\r\nand hungry wolf attacking a grizzly bear. He was sure that all danger\r\nfrom him had passed.\r\n\r\nNow, as they closed in the Northern guns increased their fire. It seemed\r\nto Dick that they could have blown away the whole plateau of Vicksburg\r\nby this time. The storm of shells raked the town, and he was glad that\r\nthe people had been able to dig caves for refuge. Colonel Woodville must\r\nbe doing some of his greatest swearing now. Dick thought of him with\r\nsympathy and friendliness.\r\n\r\n“I don't think it can last much longer, Mr. Mason,” said Sergeant Daniel\r\nWhitley on the morning of the second of July. “Their guns don't answer\r\nours often and it means that they're out of ammunition, or almost.\r\nBesides, you can stand shells and bullets easier than lack of food.\r\n'Pears to me I can nearly feel 'em crumpling up before us.”\r\n\r\nTrumpets blew the next morning. All the firing ceased suddenly and the\r\nthree lads saw a Southern general with several officers of lower rank,\r\nriding forward under a white flag. It was Bowen, who came out to meet\r\nGrant.\r\n\r\nDick drew a deep, long breath. He knew that this was the end. So did his\r\ncomrades. A cheer started and swept part of the way along the lines, but\r\nthe officers quickly stopped it.\r\n\r\n“Vicksburg is ours,” said Dick.\r\n\r\n“Looks like it,” said Warner.\r\n\r\nBut Grant told Bowen that he would treat only with Pemberton, and after\r\ndelays General Pemberton came out. General Grant went forward to meet\r\nhim. The two stood alone under a tree within seventy yards of the\r\nConfederate lines and talked.\r\n\r\nChance or fortune presented a startling coincidence. Almost at the very\r\nmoment that Grant and Pemberton met under the tree Pickett's men were\r\nrising to their feet and preparing for the immortal but fatal charge at\r\nGettysburg. While the cannon had ceased suddenly at Vicksburg they were\r\nthundering from many score mouths at Gettysburg. Fortune was launching\r\ntwo thunderbolts upon the Confederacy at the same moment. They were to\r\nstrike upon fields a thousand miles apart, and the double blow was to be\r\nmortal.\r\n\r\nBut Dick knew nothing of Gettysburg then, nor was he to know anything\r\nuntil days afterward. He certainly had no thought of the East while he\r\nwatched the two generals under the tree. Dick's comrades were with him,\r\nbut so intense was their curiosity that none of them spoke. Thousands\r\nof men were gazing with the same eagerness, and the Southern earthworks\r\nwere covered with the defenders.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most dramatic scenes in Dick's life, the two men under\r\nthe tree, and the tens of thousands who watched. Nobody moved. It seemed\r\nthat they scarcely breathed. After the continuous roar of firing the\r\nsudden silence was oppressive, and Dick felt the blood pounding in his\r\nears.\r\n\r\nThe heat was close and heavy. Black clouds were floating up in the west,\r\nand lightning glimmered now and then on the horizon. Although the storm\r\nthreatened no one noticed. All eyes were still for Grant and Pemberton.\r\nAfter a while each returned to his own command, and there was an\r\narmistice until the next day, when the full surrender was made, and\r\nGrant and his officers rode into Vicksburg. At the same time Lee was\r\ngathering his men for the retreat into the South from the stricken field\r\nof Gettysburg. It was the Fourth of July, the eighty-seventh anniversary\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, and no one could have possibly\r\nconceived a more striking celebration.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Dick was free for a little space he hurried to the ravine,\r\nand, as before, found there the open door. He passed in without\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nThe light as of old filtered into the room, and Colonel Woodville lay\r\njust as before in bed with his great bald head upon the pillow. Miss\r\nWoodville sat beside the bed, reading aloud from Addison. Dick's step\r\nwas light, but the colonel heard him and held up a finger. The lad\r\npaused until Miss Woodville, finishing a long sentence, closed the\r\nbook. Then the colonel, raising a little the great white thatch of his\r\neyebrows, said:\r\n\r\n“Young sir, you have returned again, and, personally, you are welcome,\r\nbut I do not conceive how you can stand the company you keep. My\r\ndaughter informs me that the Yankees are in Vicksburg, and I have no\r\nreason to doubt the statement.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and Dick said:\r\n\r\n“Yes, Colonel, it's true.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose we must endure it. I should have gone myself and have offered\r\nmy sword to General Grant, but this confounded leg of mine is still\r\nweak.”\r\n\r\n“At least, sir, we come with something besides arms. May I bring you\r\nrations?”\r\n\r\n“You are generous, young man, and my daughter and I appreciate the\r\nobvious nature of your errand here. Speaking for both of us, a little\r\nfood will not be unwelcome.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me first, what has become of your nephew. Has he escaped from the\r\ncity?”\r\n\r\n“He slipped out nearly a week ago, and will join his father's regiment\r\nin Bragg's command. That scoundrel, Slade, is gone too. Since the city\r\nhad to be surrendered I would gladly have made you a present of Slade,\r\nbut it's out of my power now.”\r\n\r\nDick soon returned with ample food for them and helped them later, when\r\nthey moved to quarters outside in the shell-torn city. Dick saw that\r\nthey were comfortable, and then his mind turned toward Tennessee.\r\nDetachments from Grant's army were to be sent to that of Rosecrans, who\r\nwas now heavily threatened by Bragg, and the Winchester regiment, which\r\nreally belonged with him, was sure to go.\r\n\r\nThe order to march soon came, and it was welcome. The regiment, or\r\nrather what was left of it, promptly embarked upon one of the river\r\nsteamers and started northward.\r\n\r\nAs they stood on the deck and looked down at the yellow waters in which\r\nDick had swum on his trusty plank Warner said:\r\n\r\n“I've news of importance. It arrived in a telegram to General Grant, and\r\nI heard it just as we were coming on board.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Dick.\r\n\r\n“General Lee was defeated in a great battle at a little place called\r\nGettysburg in Pennsylvania, and has retreated into Virginia.”\r\n\r\n“Gettysburg and Vicksburg!” exclaimed Dick. “The wheel has turned nearly\r\n'round. The Confederacy is doomed now.”\r\n\r\n“I think so, too,” said Warner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. AN AFFAIR OF THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough they were on board one of the fastest steamers in the Union\r\nservice, Dick and his comrades had a long journey by river. But it\r\nwas not unpleasant. They enjoyed the rest and ease after the weeks of\r\nfighting and service in the trenches before Vicksburg. The absence of\r\nwar and the roar of cannon and rifles was like a happy dream between\r\ndays of fighting. As they went northward on the great river it almost\r\nseemed as if peace had returned.\r\n\r\nWarner studied his algebra and two other books of mathematics which he\r\nwas lucky enough to find on board. Pennington slept a great deal of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“I learned it on the plains from the Indians,” he said. “When they don't\r\nhave anything to do they sleep and gather strength for the hour of need.\r\nI think the time is coming soon when they won't let me sleep at all, and\r\nthen I can draw on the great supply I have in stock.”\r\n\r\n“Likely enough it's near,” said Dick dreamily. “They say Bragg has a\r\ngreat army now, and you know that, while Rosecrans is slow he's pretty\r\nsure. Thomas and McCook and the others are with him, too. I expect to\r\nsee 'Pap' Thomas again. He's a general to my liking.”\r\n\r\n“And to mine, too,” said Pennington, “but we can talk about him later\r\non, because I'm going to sleep again inside of a minute.”\r\n\r\nDick was not averse to silence, as he, too, was half asleep; that is, he\r\nwas in a dreamy stage, and he was at peace with the world and his fellow\r\nmen. From under drooping eyelids he was vaguely watching the low shores\r\nof the Mississippi, and the great mass of yellow waters moving onward\r\nfrom the far vague forests of the North in their journey of four\r\nthousand miles to the gulf.\r\n\r\nLike all boys of the great valley, Dick always felt the romance and\r\nspell of the Mississippi. It was to him and them one of the greatest\r\nfacts in the natural world, the grave of De Soto, the stream on which\r\ntheir fathers and forefathers had explored and traded and fought since\r\ntheir beginnings. Now it was fulfilling its titanic role again, and the\r\nUnion fleets upon its bosom were splitting the Confederacy asunder.\r\n\r\nHe, too, fell asleep before long. Warner glanced at his comrades who\r\nslept so well on a hard bench, and his look was rather envious. He\r\nreturned his beloved algebra to his pocket, leaned back on the bench\r\nalso, and, although he had not believed it possible, slept also inside\r\nof five minutes. Colonel Winchester passing smiled sympathetically, but\r\nhis glance lingered longest on Dick.\r\n\r\nAfter days on the water the regiment disembarked, marched more days\r\nacross the country, joining other regiments on the way, and reached\r\nthe rear guard of the army of Rosecrans, which was already marching\r\nsouthward in the direction of Chattanooga to meet that of Bragg. They\r\nadvanced now over the Cumberland mountains through a country wild\r\nand thinly inhabited. The summer was waning, but it was cool on the\r\nmountains and in the passes, nor was it so dry as the year before, when\r\nthey fought that terrible battle at Perryville in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nDick was glad to be again in the high country, the land of firm soil and\r\nof many clear, rushing streams. Heart and lungs expanded, when he looked\r\nupon the long ridges, clothed in deep forest, and breathed the pure air\r\nthat blew down from their summits. Yet his dream of peace was over.\r\nAs they advanced through the forests and passes they were harassed\r\nincessantly by sharpshooters on the slopes, who melted away before them,\r\nbut who returned on the very heels of the vain pursuit to vex them again\r\nwith bullets.\r\n\r\nThey heard soon that the most daring of these bands was led by a man\r\nnamed Slade, and Dick's pulse took a jump. He felt in a curious sort of\r\nway that this man Slade was still following him. It seemed more than a\r\ndecree of chance that their fates should be intertwined. He hoped that\r\nSlade would never hear how he had been hidden in that hole in the ravine\r\nwith the Woodvilles. Trouble could come of it for gallant young Victor\r\nWoodville, and even for his uncle. He was sure that Victor was now with\r\nBragg and they might meet face to face again.\r\n\r\nAs they rode through a defile and came into a wide valley they saw\r\nbefore them an extensive Union camp, and they were overjoyed to learn\r\nthat it was the division of Thomas, the general to whom they were to\r\nreport. Dick had once received the personal thanks of Thomas, and\r\nthe grave, able man inspired him with immense respect, mingled with\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nHe stood before Thomas in his tent that evening, Colonel Winchester\r\nhaving yielded to his request to take him with him when he reported the\r\narrival of his regiment. Thomas, usually so taciturn, delighted the soul\r\nof the lad by remembering him at once.\r\n\r\n“It was you, Lieutenant Mason, who came to me there in the Kentucky\r\nmountains with the dispatches,” he said, “and you were also with us at\r\nPerryville and Stone River.”\r\n\r\n“I was, sir,” said Dick, flushing with pride.\r\n\r\n“And you were with General Grant at the taking of Vicksburg! It was a\r\ngreat exploit, and it has lifted us up mightily. But I'm glad to have\r\nyou back along with Colonel Winchester and the rest of his brave lads.\r\nI think you'll see action before long, action perhaps on a greater scale\r\nthan any witnessed hitherto in the West.”\r\n\r\nDick saluted and withdrew. He knew that a young lieutenant must not stay\r\ntoo long in the presence of a commanding general and he quickly rejoined\r\nWarner and Pennington.\r\n\r\n“How's the old man?” asked Pennington, with the familiarity of youth,\r\nwhich was not disrespectful in the absence of the “old man.”\r\n\r\n“'Pap' Thomas is looking well,” replied Dick. “I fancy that his\r\ndigestion was never better. He did not act in a belligerent way, but I\r\nthink he's hunting for a fight.”\r\n\r\n“Since you and Warner and I have arrived he can begin it.”\r\n\r\n“I think it's coming,” said Dick earnestly. “Often you can feel when\r\nthings are moving to some end, and I'm sure that we'll measure strength\r\nagain with Bragg before the autumn has gone far.”\r\n\r\nThe valley in which the camp lay was green and beautiful, and a deep,\r\nclear little river from the mountains, ran rushing, through it. The\r\nthree lads lay on their blankets near the bank and listened to the\r\nmusical sweep of the stream. Pennington suddenly sprang up and hailed:\r\n\r\n“Hey, Ohio, is that you? Come here!”\r\n\r\nA tall youth emerged from the dusk and looked at them inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Ohio,” said Pennington, “don't you remember your friends?”\r\n\r\nThe long, lean lad looked again, and then he was enthusiastically\r\nshaking hands with each in turn.\r\n\r\n“Remember you!” he exclaimed. “Of course I do. If it hadn't been so dark\r\nI'd have seen you and called to you first. I'm glad you're alive. It's\r\na lot to live in these times. I tried to find out about you fellows but\r\ncouldn't. We came in a detachment ahead of you. But if you'll invite me,\r\nI'll stay awhile with you and talk.”\r\n\r\nThey offered him a blanket and he stretched out upon it, turning his\r\neyes up to the sky, in which the stars were now coming.\r\n\r\n“What are you thinking about, Ohio?” asked Dick.\r\n\r\n“I'm thinking how fast I'm growing old. Two years and a half in the war,\r\nbut it's twenty-five years in fact. I hadn't finished school when I left\r\nhome and here I am, a veteran of more battles than any soldiers have\r\nfought since the days of old Bonaparte. If I happen to live through\r\nthis war, which I mean to do, I wonder how I'll ever settle down at home\r\nagain. Father will say to me: 'Get the plough and break up the five-acre\r\nfield for corn,' and me, maybe a veteran of a dozen pitched battles in\r\nevery one of which anywhere from one hundred thousand to two hundred\r\nthousand men have been engaged, not to mention fifty or a hundred\r\nsmaller battles and four or five hundred skirmishes.\r\n\r\n“When the flies begin to buzz around me I'll think they make a mighty\r\npoor noise compared with the roar of three or four hundred big cannon\r\nand a hundred thousand rifles that I've listened to so often. If a\r\nyellow jacket should sting me, I'd say what a little thing it is,\r\ncompared with the piece of shrapnel that hit me at some battle not yet\r\nfought. Maybe I'd find things so quiet I just couldn't stand it. Wars\r\nare mighty unsettling.”\r\n\r\n“I'm thinking,” said Dick, “that before this war is over all of us will\r\nget enough of it to last a lifetime. We've got the edge on 'em now,\r\nsince Vicksburg and Gettysburg, but the Graybacks are not yet beaten by\r\na long shot. We've heard how Lee drew off from Gettysburg carrying all\r\nhis guns and supplies, and even with Gettysburg we haven't been doing so\r\nwell in the East as we have in the West. You know that, Ohio?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, I do. But I think the Johnnies have made their high-water\r\nmark. Great work our army did down there at Vicksburg, and we'll have\r\nthe chance to do just as well against Bragg. We'll defeat him, of\r\ncourse. Now, Mason, notice that light flickering on the mountain up\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the crest of a ridge two or three miles away, where Dick\r\nsaw a point of flame appearing and reappearing, and answered by another\r\npoint farther down, which flickered in the same manner.\r\n\r\n“Signals of some kind, I suppose,” replied Dick, “but I don't know who\r\nmakes them or what they mean.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know what they mean, either,” said Ohio; “but I can guess\r\npretty well who's making them. That's Slade.”\r\n\r\n“Slade!” said Dick.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you seem to have heard of him?”\r\n\r\n“So I have, and I've seen him, also. I heard, too, that he was up here\r\nmaking things unhappy for our side. He was in Vicksburg, although you\r\nmay not have heard of him there, but he got out before the surrender. A\r\ncunning fellow. A sort of land pirate.”\r\n\r\n“He's all of that. Since we've been coming through the mountains he and\r\nhis band have picked off a lot of our men. Those signals must mean that\r\nthey're preparing for another raid. I shouldn't like to be a half-mile\r\nfrom our lines to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Why can't we smoke him out, Ohio?”\r\n\r\n“Because when we're half way up the slope he and his men are gone on the\r\nother side. Besides, they can rake us with bullets from ambush, while\r\nwe're climbing up the ridge. And when we get there, they're gone. It's\r\nthese mountains that give the irregulars their chance. See, two lights\r\nare winking at each other now!”\r\n\r\n“How far apart would you say they are, Ohio?”\r\n\r\n“A mile, maybe, but one is much higher than the other up the mountain.\r\nThe lower light, doubtless, is signaling information about us to the\r\nhigher. I see your colonel and our colonel talking together. Maybe we're\r\ngoing to set a trap. It would be a good thing if we could clean out\r\nthose fellows.”\r\n\r\n“I'm thinking that your guess is a good one,” said Dick, as he rose to\r\nhis feet, “because Colonel Winchester is beckoning to me now.”\r\n\r\n“And there's a call for me, too,” said Ohio, rising. “Talk of a thing\r\nand it happens. We're surely going for those lights.”\r\n\r\nThey had reckoned right. General Thomas, when he saw the signals,\r\nhad summoned some of his best officers and they had talked together\r\nearnestly. The general had not said much before, but the incessant\r\nsharpshooting from the bushes and slopes as they marched southward had\r\ncaused him intense annoyance, and, if continued, he knew that it would\r\nhurt the spirit of the troops.\r\n\r\n“We shall try to trap Slade's band to-night,” said Colonel Winchester to\r\nDick and the other young officers who gathered around him. “We think he\r\nhas three or four hundred men and my regiment can deal with that number.\r\nWe will defile to the right without noise and make our way up the\r\nmountain. An Ohio regiment, which can also deal with Slade if it catches\r\nhim, will defile to the left. Maybe we can trap these irregulars between\r\nus. Sergeant Whitley will guide my force.”\r\n\r\nThe sergeant stepped forward, proud of the honor and trust. Dick,\r\nlooking at him in the moonlight, said to himself for the hundredth time\r\nthat he was a magnificent specimen of American manhood, thick, powerful,\r\nintelligent, respectful to his superior officers, who often knew less\r\nthan he did, a veteran from whom woods, hills, and plains hid few\r\nsecrets. He thought it a good thing that the sergeant was to be their\r\nguide, because he would lead them into no ambush.\r\n\r\nAs Dick turned away for departure Ohio said to him:\r\n\r\n“We'll meet on the mountain side, and I hope we'll catch our game, but\r\ndon't you fellows fire into us in the dark.”\r\n\r\nDick promised and his regiment marched away toward the slope. All were\r\non foot, of course, and they had received strict instructions to make no\r\nnoise. They turned northward, left the camp behind them, and were soon\r\nhidden in the dark.\r\n\r\nDick was at the head of the column with Colonel Winchester and the\r\nsergeant. Warner and Pennington were further back. The darkness was\r\nheavy in the shadow of the slope and among the bushes, but, looking\r\nbackward, Dick clearly saw the camp of General Thomas with its thousands\r\nof men and dozens of fires. Figures passed and repassed before the\r\nflames, and the fused noises of a great camp came from the valley.\r\n\r\nDick took only a glance or two. His whole attention now was for the\r\nsergeant, who was looking here and there and sniffing the air, like a\r\ngreat hound seeking the trail. The soldier had melted into the scout,\r\nand Colonel Winchester, knowing him so well, had, in effect, turned the\r\nregiment over to him.\r\n\r\nDick and other young officers were sent back through the column to see\r\nthat they marched without noise. It was not difficult to enforce the\r\norders, as the men were filled with the ardor of the hunt, and would do\r\neverything to insure its success. When Dick came back to the head of the\r\ncolumn he merely heard the tread of feet and the rustling of uniforms\r\nagainst the bushes behind them.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant led on with unerring skill and instinct. They were rising\r\nfast on the slope, and the great forest received and hid them as if they\r\nwere its wild children returned to their home. The foliage was so dense\r\nthat Dick caught only flitting glimpses of the camp below, although many\r\nfires were yet burning there.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of putting the regiment into the hands of the sergeant\r\nwas now shown. Rising to the trust, he called up all his reserves of\r\nwilderness lore. He listened attentively to the voice of every night\r\nbird, because it might not be real, but instead the imitation call of\r\nman to man. He searched in every opening under the moonlight for traces\r\nof footsteps, which he alone could have seen, and, when at last he found\r\nthem, Dick, despite the dusk, saw his figure expand and his eyes flash.\r\nHe had been kneeling down examining the imprints and when he arose the\r\ncolonel asked:\r\n\r\n“What is it, Whitley?”\r\n\r\n“Men have passed here, sir, and, as they couldn't have been ours, they\r\nwere the enemy. The tracks lead south on the slope, and they must have\r\nbeen going that way to join Slade's command.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think, Sergeant, we should follow this trail?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly, sir, but we must look out for an ambush. These men know\r\nthe mountains thoroughly, and if we were to walk into their trap they\r\nmight cut us to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“Then we won't walk into it. Lead on, Sergeant. If the enemy is near, I\r\nknow that you will find him in time.”\r\n\r\nThe sergeant's brown face flushed with pride, but he followed on the\r\ntrail without a word and behind him came the whole regiment, implicit\r\nin its trust, and winding without noise like a great coiling serpent\r\nthrough the forest.\r\n\r\nDick was a woodsman himself, and he kept close to the sergeant, watching\r\nhis methods, and seeking also what he could find. While they lost the\r\ntrail now and then, he saw the sergeant recover it in the openings. He\r\nnoted, too, that it was increasing in size. Little trails were flowing\r\ninto the big one like brooks into a river, and the main course was\r\nuniformly south, but bearing slightly upward on the slope.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant stopped at the melancholy cry of an owl, apparently three\r\nor four hundred yards ahead. Both he and Dick raised their heads and\r\nlistened for the answer, which they felt sure was ready. The long,\r\nsinister hoot in reply came from a point considerably farther away, but\r\nat about the same height on the slope.\r\n\r\n“They have two forces, sir,” said the sergeant to Colonel Winchester,\r\n“and I think they're about to unite.”\r\n\r\n“As a wilderness fighter, what would you suggest, Sergeant?”\r\n\r\n“To wait here a little and lie hidden in the brush. We're rightly afraid\r\nof an ambush if we go on, then why not make the same danger theirs? I\r\nthink it likely that the other force is coming this way. Anyway, we can\r\ntell in a minute or two, 'cause them owls are sure to hoot again. If I'm\r\nright, we can catch 'em napping.”\r\n\r\n“An excellent idea, Sergeant. Ah! there are the signals you predicted!”\r\n\r\nThe owl hooted again from the same point directly in front, and then\r\ncame the reply of the other, now nearer. The sergeant drew a deep breath\r\nof satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, I was right,” he said. “Their meeting place is straight in\r\nfront. Will you let me slip forward a little through the brush and see?”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead, Sergeant. We need all the information we can get, but don't\r\nwalk into any trap yourself, leaving us here without eyes or ears.”\r\n\r\n“Never fear, sir. I won't be caught.”\r\n\r\nThen he disappeared with a suddenness that made the colonel and Dick\r\ngasp. He was with them, and then he was not. But he returned in ten\r\nminutes, and, although Dick could not see it in his face, he was\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n“There's a glade not more'n four hundred yards ahead,” he whispered to\r\nthe colonel, “and about a hundred and fifty men, armed with long rifles,\r\nare lying down in it waiting for a second force, which I judge from the\r\ncry of the owl will be there inside of five minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Colonel Winchester, breathing fast, “we'll wait ten minutes\r\nand attack. It would be a great stroke to wipe out Slade's band. I'm\r\nsorry for those Ohio fellows, but the luck's ours to-night, or I should\r\nsay that the sergeant's skill as a trailer has given us the chance.”\r\n\r\nIt was soon known along the black, winding line that the enemy was at\r\nhand, and the men were eager to attack, but they were ordered to have\r\npatience for a little while. Their leader wished to destroy Slade's\r\nwhole force at one stroke.\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester took out his watch and held it before him in the\r\nfaint moonlight. He would not move until the ten minutes exactly had\r\npassed. Then he closed the watch and gave the signal, but stationed\r\nofficers along the line to see that the men made as little noise as\r\npossible. The long black column moved again through the forest and Dick,\r\nfull of excitement was at its head with the colonel and the sergeant.\r\n\r\nThey reached a slope, crept up it, and then spread out, as they knew\r\nthat the valley and the enemy were within rifle shot. Dick, glancing\r\nthrough the bushes, saw the glitter of steel and caught the murmur of\r\nvoices. He knew that their presence was not yet suspected, and he did\r\nnot like the idea of firing from ambush upon anybody, but there was no\r\noccasion for testing his scruples, as the advance of so many men created\r\nnoise sufficient to reach the alert ears in the glade.\r\n\r\n“Up, men! The enemy!” he heard a voice shout. Colonel Winchester at the\r\nsame moment ordered his men to fire and charge with the bayonet.\r\n\r\nA terrible volley was poured into the valley, and it seemed to Dick that\r\nhalf of Slade's force went down, but as they rushed forward to finish\r\nthe task they met a fire that caused many of the Union soldiers to drop.\r\nSlade was evidently a man of ability. Dick saw him springing about and\r\nblowing a little silver whistle, which he knew was a call to rally.\r\n\r\nBut the surprise was too sudden and great. The irregulars, fighting\r\nhard, were driven out of the valley and into the woods on the upper side\r\nof the glade. Sheltered in the underbrush, they might have made a\r\ngood defense there, but a sudden tremendous cheer arose, and they were\r\ncharged in the flank by the Ohio regiment, coming up on the run.\r\n\r\nSpurred by emulation the Winchester men also rushed into the underbrush,\r\nand those of Slade's men who had not fallen quickly threw down their\r\narms. But they did not catch the leader, nor did they know what had\r\nbecome of him, until Dick caught sight of a little, weazened figure\r\nunder an enormous wide-brimmed hat running with three or four others\r\nalong the mountain-side.\r\n\r\n“Slade! Slade!” he cried, pointing, and instantly a score, Dick and the\r\nsergeant among them, were hotfoot after the fugitives. Several shots\r\nwere fired, but none hit, and the chase lengthened out.\r\n\r\nSergeant Whitley exclaimed to Dick:\r\n\r\n“We catch the pack, but if we don't catch the leader there'll be another\r\npack soon.”\r\n\r\n“Right you are! We must have that little man under the big hat!”\r\n\r\nDick heard panting breaths, and Warner and Pennington drew up by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n“Slade's about to escape!” exclaimed Dick. “We must get him!”\r\n\r\n“I'm running my best,” said Warner. “Look out!” Slade suddenly faced\r\nabout and fired a heavy pistol. Dick had dropped down at Warner's\r\nwarning cry and the bullet sang over his head. The sergeant fired in\r\nreturn, but the light was too faint, and Slade and the three who were\r\nwith him ran on unharmed.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit, conducted with such vigor, soon led to the top of the\r\nmountain, and they began the descent of the far side. Several more shots\r\nwere fired, but they did no damage, and neither side was able to gain.\r\nTwo of the fugitives turned aside into the woods, but the pursuit kept\r\nstraight after Slade, and his remaining companion, a slender, youthful\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n“I think we'll get 'em,” panted the sergeant. As he spoke one of the\r\nlittle mountain rivers so numerous in that region came into view. It was\r\nnarrow, but deep, and without hesitating an instant the fugitives sprang\r\ninto it and shot down the stream, swimming with all their strength, and\r\nhelped by the powerful current.\r\n\r\nSlade was in advance, and he was already disappearing in the shadows on\r\nthe far bank, but his comrade, he of the slender figure, was still in\r\nthe moonlight, which fell across his face for a moment. A soldier raised\r\nhis rifle to fire, but Dick stumbled and fell against him and the bullet\r\nwent high in the air.\r\n\r\nThe moment had been long enough for Dick to recognize Victor Woodville.\r\nHe did not know how he happened to be with Slade, but he did not intend\r\nthat he should be shot there in the water, and his impulse was quick\r\nenough to save Victor's life. In another moment the young Mississippian\r\nwas gone also in the shadows, and although several of the Union men swam\r\nthe river they could discover no trace of either.\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry,” said the sergeant as they walked back to the other side of\r\nthe mountain, “that they got away.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dick, “it was too bad that Slade escaped.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. THE RIVER OF DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nDick knew that he had saved young Woodville's life, but his conscience\r\nwas quite dear. If he had the same chance he would do it over again, but\r\nhe was sorry they had not caught Slade. He felt no hostility toward the\r\nregular soldiers of the Confederacy, but he knew there were guerillas on\r\ntheir side, as well as his own, who would stop at nothing. He remembered\r\nSkelly, who, claiming to be a Union partisan, nevertheless robbed and\r\neven killed those of either party whenever he felt it safe to do so.\r\nSlade was his Southern complement, and he would surely get together a\r\nnew force as venomous as the old.\r\n\r\nBut Colonel Winchester and the commander of the Ohio regiment were full\r\nof pride in their exploit, as they had a right to be. They had destroyed\r\na swarm of wasps which had been buzzing and stinging almost beyond\r\nendurance, and they were still prouder when they received the thanks of\r\nGeneral Thomas.\r\n\r\nThe corps moved forward the next day, and soon the whole army was united\r\nunder Rosecrans. It was a powerful force, about ninety thousand men, the\r\nstaunch fighters of the West, veterans of great battles and victories,\r\nand to the young officers it appeared invincible. Their feeling that it\r\nwas marching to another triumph was confirmed by the news that Bragg was\r\nretreating.\r\n\r\nYet the two armies were so close to each other that the Northern\r\nvanguard skirmished with the Southern rearguard as they passed through\r\nthe mountains. At one point in a gap of the Cumberland Mountains the\r\nSoutherners made a sharp resistance, but they were quickly driven from\r\ntheir position and the Union mass rolled slowly on. Exultation among the\r\ntroops increased.\r\n\r\n“We'll drive Bragg away down into the South against Grant,” said Ohio to\r\nDick, “and we'll crush him between the two arms of the vise. That will\r\nfinish everything in the West.”\r\n\r\nWhile Dick was exultant, too, he had certain reservations. He had seen\r\na like confidence carried to disaster in the East, although it did not\r\nseem possible that the result here could be similar.\r\n\r\n“I don't think they'll keep on retreating forever, Ohio,” he said. “All\r\nour supplies are coming from Nashville, and we are getting farther away\r\nfrom our base every day.”\r\n\r\nBut Ohio laughed.\r\n\r\n“Our chief task is to catch Bragg,” he said. “They said he was going\r\nto occupy Chattanooga and wait for us. He's been in Chattanooga, but he\r\ndidn't wait for us there. He's left it already and gone on, anxious to\r\nreach the Gulf before winter, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nThe Union army in its turn entered Chattanooga, a little town of which\r\nDick had seldom heard before, although he greatly admired its situation.\r\nThe country about it was bold and romantic. It stood in a sharp curve\r\nof the great river, the Tennessee. Not far away was the lofty uplift of\r\nLookout Mountain, a half-mile high, and there were long ridges between\r\nwhich creeks or little rivers flowed down to the Tennessee.\r\n\r\nOne of these streams was the Chickamauga, which in the language of the\r\nCherokee Indians who had once owned this region means “the river of\r\ndeath.” Why they called it so no one knew, but the name was soon to have\r\na terrible fitness. Chattanooga itself meant in the Cherokee tongue “the\r\nhawk's nest,” and anybody could see the aptness of the term.\r\n\r\nWhile Lookout Mountain was the loftiest summit, some of the other ridges\r\nrose almost as high, through the gaps of which the Northern army must\r\npass if it continued the pursuit of Bragg.\r\n\r\nSeptember had now come and the winds were growing crisper in the high\r\ncountry. The feel of autumn was in the air, and the coolness made the\r\nmarching brisker. The division to which Dick belonged was advancing\r\nslowly. He often saw Thomas, and his admiration for the grave, silent\r\nman grew. It was said that Thomas was slow, but that he never made\r\nmistakes. Now the rumor was spreading that he had warned Rosecrans to be\r\ncautious, that Bragg had a powerful army and when he reached favorable\r\npositions, would certainly turn and fight.\r\n\r\nNot many were impressed by these reports. They merely said it was “Pap”\r\n Thomas' way of looking at the dark side of things first. Hadn't they\r\ndriven Bragg through the Cumberland Mountains and out of Chattanooga,\r\nand now they would soon be on his heels deep down in Georgia. But Dick,\r\nnoticing Colonel Winchester's serious face, surmised that he at least\r\nshared the opinion of his chief. And when the lad looked up at the great\r\ncoils and ridges he felt that, in truth, they might go too far. If the\r\nNorthern men were veterans, so were the Southern, and neither had taken\r\nmuch change of the other at Shiloh, Perryville and Stone River.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment was thrown forward as the vanguard of the\r\ninfantry, and the face of the colonel grew more serious than ever, when\r\nthe best scouts rode in with reports that the Southern retreat was now\r\nvery slow. There was news, too, that Slade had a new band much larger\r\nthan before, and they formed a rear guard of skirmishers which made\r\nevery moment of a Northern scout's life a moment of danger. The\r\nWinchester regiment itself was often fired upon from ambush, and there\r\nwere vacant places in the ranks.\r\n\r\nDick did not know whether it was his own intuition or the influence that\r\nflowed from the opinions of Thomas and Winchester, but much of his high\r\nexultation was abated. He regarded the lofty ridges and the deep gaps\r\nwith apprehension. It was a difficult country and the Southern leaders\r\nmust know that the Northern army was extended over a long line, with\r\nThomas holding the left.\r\n\r\nHis premonitions had ample cause. Bragg as he fell back slowly had\r\ngathered new forces. Rosecrans did not yet know it, but the army before\r\nhim was the most powerful that the South ever assembled in the West.\r\nPolk and Cleburne and Breckinridge and Forrest and Fighting Joe Wheeler\r\nand a whole long roll of famous Southern generals were there. Nor had\r\nthe vigilant eyes of the Confederacy in the East failed to note the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nJust as the armies were coming into touch a division of the Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia was passing by train over the mountains. It was led\r\nby a thick-bearded, powerful man, no less a general than the renowned\r\nLongstreet, sent to help Bragg. The veterans of the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia would swell Bragg's ranks, and the great army, turning a\r\nsanguine face northward, was eager for Rosecrans to come on. The\r\nSouthern force would number more than ninety thousand men, more numerous\r\nthan ever before or afterward in the West.\r\n\r\nIt was now late in September, the eve of the eighteenth, and Dick\r\nand his comrades lay near the little creek with the rhythmical name,\r\nChickamauga. It was the very night that a portion of the Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia had arrived in Bragg's camp. The preceding days had\r\nbeen full of detached fighting, and the night had come heavy with omens\r\nand presages. The least intelligent knew now that Bragg had stopped, but\r\nthey did not know that Longstreet was to be with him.\r\n\r\nDick and his comrades sat by a smothered fire, and the vast tangle of\r\nmountains and passes, of valleys and streams looked sinister to them.\r\nThere had been skirmishing throughout the day, and as the darkness\r\nclosed down they still heard occasional rifle shots on the slopes and\r\nridges.\r\n\r\n“Don't these mountains make you think of your native Vermont, George?”\r\n asked Dick.\r\n\r\n“In a way, yes,” replied Warner, “but my hills are not bristling with\r\nsteel as these are.”\r\n\r\n“No, you New Englanders are fortunate. The war will never be carried on\r\non your soil. You shed your blood, but, after all, the states that are\r\ntrodden under foot by the armies suffer most.”\r\n\r\n“There are lights winking on the mountains again,” said Pennington.\r\n\r\n“Let 'em wink,” said Dick. “Their signals can't amount to much now. We\r\nknow that Bragg is before us, and a great battle can't be delayed long.\r\nFellows, I'm not so sure about the result.”\r\n\r\n“Come! Come, Dick!” said Warner. “It's not often you're downhearted.\r\nWhat's struck you?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, George, but, between you and me and the gate post, I wish that\r\nour old 'Pap' Thomas commanded all the army, instead of the left merely.\r\nI've learned a few things to-day. The enemy is spreading out, trying to\r\nenfold us on both wings.”\r\n\r\n“What of it?”\r\n\r\n“It means that they are sanguine of victory, and they want to stand\r\nbetween us and Chattanooga, so they can cut off our retreat, after we're\r\nbeaten, as they think we surely will be. But their main force is not\r\nfar from us now, so a scout told me. It's massed heavily along the right\r\nbank of the Chickamauga.”\r\n\r\n“And if there's a battle to-morrow we're likely to receive the first\r\nattack?”\r\n\r\n“Could it come any better than at the place where Thomas stands?”\r\n\r\nThey sat long by the fire and Dick could not rest. Shiloh, his capture,\r\nand his knowledge of the secret Southern advance, of which he could give\r\nno warning, came back to him with uncommon vividness. He knew that\r\nno such surprise could occur here, but they seemed to be lost in the\r\nwilderness. The mountains and forests oppressed him.\r\n\r\n“Well, Dick,” said Warner, “we're posted strongly. We've rows of\r\nsentinels as thick as hedges, and I've the colonel's permission to go to\r\nsleep. I'll be slumbering in ten minutes, and I'd advise you to do the\r\nsame.”\r\n\r\nHe lay on a blanket and soon slept. Pennington followed him to\r\nslumberland, but Dick lingered. He saw lights still flashing on the\r\nmountains, and he heard now and then reports from the rifles of the\r\nskirmishers, who yet sought each other despite the darkness. But he\r\nyielded at last and he, too, slept until the dawn, which should bring\r\nnearly two hundred thousand men face to face in mortal combat.\r\n\r\nDick was awake early. The September morning came, crisp and clear, the\r\nsun showing red gleams over the mountains. He heard already the sound of\r\ndistant rifle shots in front, and, through his glasses, he saw far away\r\nfaint puffs of smoke. But it was a familiar sound in this mighty war,\r\nand he found himself singularly calm. He never knew how he was going to\r\nfeel on the eve of battle. Sometimes the constriction at his heart was\r\npainful, and sometimes its beat was smooth and regular.\r\n\r\nAll the officers of the Winchester regiment were dismounted owing to the\r\nrough nature of the country in which they were stationed. They held the\r\nmost uneven part of the center, where thickets and ravines were many.\r\nHot food and coffee were served to them, and new warmth and courage\r\nflowed through their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe distant fire increased, and, standing on a hillock, Dick looked\r\nlong through his glasses. A faint haze which had hung in the south was\r\nclearing away. The rays of the sun were intensely bright. The brown\r\nof autumn glowed like gold, and the red splashes here and there burned\r\nscarlet. He saw pink dots appearing on a long line and he knew that the\r\nskirmishers were active and wary.\r\n\r\n“There can be no doubt of the advance!” he said to Warner. “A strong\r\nbody of our cavalry disclosed their forward movement, and there are\r\nthe skirmishers signaling that Bragg is near. Wonderful fellows, those\r\nsharpshooters! They're the eyes of the army. We stand in mass and fight\r\ntogether, but every one of them individually takes his life in his own\r\nhands. The firing is coming nearer. I think we'll be attacked first.”\r\n\r\nAfter a little pause Warner said:\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry our line is extended so much. What if they should cut through\r\nand get behind us?”\r\n\r\n“They'll never do it while General Thomas is here. I believe they called\r\nhim 'Old Slow Top' at West Point, but if he's slow in advance he's still\r\nslower in retreat. I'd rather have him commanding us just now than any\r\nother general in the world.”\r\n\r\n“I think you're right, and here he comes! Listen to the cheering!”\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas rode slowly along his line, inspecting the position\r\nof every regiment and making some changes. He showed no trace of\r\nexcitement. The face was calm and the heavy jaw was set firmly. If Grant\r\nwas a bulldog Thomas was another. The men knew him. They had seen him\r\nstand like a rock before, and the thrill of confidence and courage which\r\nhelp so much to win ran through them all.\r\n\r\nDick saw the general speak to Colonel Winchester and then ride on and\r\nout of sight. All the men in the regiment were lying down, but the\r\nofficers walked back and forth in front of the line. It was the especial\r\npride of the younger ones to appear unconcerned, and some were able to\r\nmake a brave pretense.\r\n\r\nBut all the while the battle was rolling nearer. It was no longer an\r\naffair of scouting parties. The skirmishers were driven in on either\r\nside and the mighty Southern advance was coming forward in full battle\r\narray. Shells began to shriek and fall among the Northern masses, and\r\nthe fire of cannon and rifles mingled in a sinister crash. But the Union\r\nregiments, although not yet replying, remained steady, although the\r\nshower of steel that was beginning to beat upon them found many a mark.\r\nVast columns of smoke pierced by fire rose in front.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Dick's vivid fancy that the earth was shaking with the\r\ntread of the advancing brigades and the thunder of their artillery.\r\nBut he was still able to preserve his air of indifference, although his\r\nheart was now beating hard and fast. Now and then when the smoke eddied\r\nor the banks of it broke apart he raised his glasses and with their\r\npowerful vision saw the long and deep Southern columns advancing, the\r\nfield batteries in the intervals pouring a storm of death.\r\n\r\nIt was a sinister and terrible sight. The South presented here an army\r\noutnumbering its force at Shiloh two to one, and they were veterans\r\nnow, led by veteran commanders. Moreover, they had Longstreet and his\r\nmatchless fighters from Lee's army to bear them up.\r\n\r\n“What do you see, Dick?” asked Pennington, his voice distinctly audible\r\nthrough the steady roar.\r\n\r\n“Johnnies! Johnnies! Johnnies! Thousands and thousands of them and then\r\nmany thousands more. They're going to strike full upon us here!”\r\n\r\n“Let 'em come. We're taking root, growing deep into the ground and old\r\n'Pap' Thomas has grown deepest of us all! It'll be impossible to move\r\nus!”\r\n\r\n“I hope so. There go our own cannon, too, and it's a welcome sound!\r\nI can see the gaps smashed in their ranks by our fire, and ah, I see,\r\ntoo--”\r\n\r\nHe stopped short in amazed surprise, and Pennington in wonder asked:\r\n\r\n“What is it you see, Dick?”\r\n\r\n“There's a heavy cavalry force on their flank, and I caught a glimpse\r\nof a man on a great horse leading it. I know him. He's Colonel George\r\nKenton, father of Harry Kenton, that cousin of mine, of whom I've spoken\r\nto you so often.”\r\n\r\n“And here he comes charging you! But it's happened hundreds and hundreds\r\nof times in this war that relatives have come face to face in battle,\r\nand it'll happen hundreds of times more. Are they within rifle shot,\r\nDick?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, but they soon will be.”\r\n\r\nHe slung the glasses back over his shoulder. The eye alone was\r\nsufficient now to watch the charging columns. All the artillery on both\r\nsides was coming into action, and the ripping crash of so many cannon\r\nbecame so great that the officers could no longer hear one another\r\nunless they shouted. The gorges and hills caught up the sound and gave\r\nit back in increased volume.\r\n\r\nDick heard a new note in the thunder. It was made by the swift beat\r\nof hoofs, thousands of them, and the hair on his neck prickled at the\r\nroots. Forrest and the wild cavalry of the South were charging on their\r\nflanks. He felt a sudden horror lest he be trampled under the hoofs of\r\nhorses. By some curious twist of the mind his dread of such a fate was\r\nfar more acute at that moment than his fear of shells and bullets.\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester, shouting imperiously, ordered him and all the\r\nother young officers to step back now and lie down. Dick obeyed, and he\r\ncrouched by the side of Warner and Pennington. The great bank of\r\nfire and smoke was rolling nearer and yet nearer, and the cannon were\r\nfighting one another with all the speed and power of the gunners. Off on\r\nthe flank the ominous tread of Southern horsemen was coming fast.\r\n\r\nBullets began now to rain among them. The regiment would have been swept\r\naway bodily had the men not been lying down. But their time to wait and\r\nhold their fire was at an end. The colonel gave the word, and a sheet of\r\nlight leaped from the mouths of their rifles. A vast gap appeared in the\r\nSouthern line before them, but in a minute or two it closed up, and\r\nthe Southern masses came on again, as menacing as ever. Again Dick's\r\nregiment poured its shattering fire upon the Southern columns and their\r\nfront lines were blown away. Colonel Winchester at once wheeled his men\r\ninto a new position to meet the mass of Forrest's cavalry rushing down\r\nupon their flank. He was just in time to help other troops, not in\r\nnumbers enough to withstand the shock.\r\n\r\nThere were few moments in the lives of these lads as terrifying as those\r\nwhen they turned to face the fierce Forrest, the uneducated mountaineer\r\nwho had intuitively mastered Napoleon's chief maxim of war, to pour the\r\ngreatest force upon the enemy's weakest point.\r\n\r\nThe hurricane sweeping down upon them sent a chill to their hearts. Dick\r\nsaw a long line of foaming mouths, the lips drawn back from the cruel\r\nwhite teeth, and manes flying wildly. Above them rose the faces of the\r\nriders, their own eyes bloodshot, their sabers held aloft for the deadly\r\nsweep. And the thunder of galloping hoofs was more menacing than that of\r\nthe cannon.\r\n\r\nDick looked around him and saw faces turning pale. His own might be\r\nwhiter than any of theirs for all he knew, but he shouted with the other\r\nofficers:\r\n\r\n“Steady! Steady! Now pour it into 'em!”\r\n\r\nIt was well that most of the men in the regiment had become\r\nsharpshooters, and that despite the thumping of their hearts, they were\r\nable to stand firm. Their sleet of bullets emptied a hundred saddles,\r\nand slipping in the cartridges they fired again at close range. The\r\ncavalry charge seemed to stop dead in its tracks, and in an instant a\r\nscene of terrible confusion occurred. Wounded horses screaming in pain\r\nrushed wildly back upon their own comrades or through the ranks of the\r\nfoe. Injured men, shot from their saddles, were seeking to crawl out of\r\nthe way. Whirling eddies of smoke alternately hid and disclosed enemies,\r\nand from both left and right came the continuous and deafening crash of\r\ninfantry in battle.\r\n\r\nBut Forrest's men paused only a moment or two. A great mass of them\r\ngalloped out of the smoke, over the bodies of their dead comrades and\r\ndirectly into the Winchester regiment, shouting and slashing with their\r\ngreat sabers. It was well for the men that their leader had so wisely\r\nchosen ground rough and covered with bushes. Using every inch of\r\nprotection, they fired at horses and riders and thrust at them with\r\ntheir bayonets.\r\n\r\nThe battle became wild and confused, a turmoil of mingled horse and\r\nfoot, of firing and shouting and of glittering swords and bayonets. A\r\nman on a huge horse made a great sweep at Dick's head with a red saber.\r\nThe boy dropped to his knees, and felt the broad blade whistle where his\r\nhead had been.\r\n\r\nThe swordsman was borne on by the impetus of his horse, and Dick caught\r\none horrified glimpse of his face. It was Colonel Kenton, but Dick knew\r\nthat he did not know, nor did he ever know. It was never in the lad's\r\nheart to tell his uncle how near he had come unwittingly to shearing off\r\nthe head of his own nephew.\r\n\r\nThe charge of the cavalrymen carried them clear through the Winchester\r\nregiment, but a regiment coming up to the relief drove them back, and\r\nthe great mass turning aside a little attacked anew and elsewhere. A\r\nfew moments of rest were permitted Dick and his comrades, although the\r\nmighty battle wheeled and thundered all about them.\r\n\r\nBut their regiment was a melancholy sight. A third of its numbers were\r\nkilled or wounded. The ground was torn and trampled, as if it had been\r\nswept by a hurricane of wind and red rain. Dick had one slight wound\r\non his shoulder and another on his arm, but he did not feel them.\r\nPennington and Warner both had scratches, but the colonel was unharmed.\r\n\r\n“My God,” exclaimed Warner, “how did we happen to survive it!”\r\n\r\n“I live to boast that I've been ridden over by old Forrest himself,”\r\n said Pennington.\r\n\r\n“How do you know it was Forrest?”\r\n\r\n“Because his horse was eight feet high and his sword was ten feet long.\r\nHe slashed at me with it a hundred times. I counted the strokes.”\r\n\r\nThen Pennington stopped and laughed hysterically, Dick seized him by the\r\narm and shook him roughly.\r\n\r\n“Stop it, Frank! Stop it!” he cried. “You're yourself, and you're all\r\nright!”\r\n\r\nPennington shook his body, brushed his hands over his eyes and said:\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Dick, old man; you've brought me back to myself.”\r\n\r\n“Get ready!” exclaimed Warner. “The cavalry have sheered off, but the\r\ninfantry are coming, a million strong! I can hear their tread shaking\r\nthe earth!”\r\n\r\nThe broken regiment reloaded, drew its lines together and faced the\r\nenemy anew. It seemed to their bloodshot eyes that the whole Southern\r\narmy was bearing down upon them. The Southern generals, skillful and\r\ndaring, were resolved to break through the Northern left, and the attack\r\nattained all the violence of a convulsion.\r\n\r\nThe great Southern line, blazing with fire and steel, advanced, never\r\nstopping for a moment, while the fire of their cannon beat incessantly\r\nupon the devoted brigades. It was well for the Northern army, well for\r\nthe Union that here was the Rock of Chickamauga. Amid all the terrible\r\nuproar and the yet more terrible danger, Thomas never lost his courage\r\nand presence of mind for a moment. Dick saw him more than once, and he\r\nknew how he doubly and triply earned the famous name which that day and\r\nthe next were to give him.\r\n\r\nBut the weight was so tremendous that they began to give ground. They\r\nwent back slowly, but they went back. Dick felt as if the whole weight\r\nwere pressing upon his own chest, and when he tried to shout no words\r\nwould come.\r\n\r\nBack they went, inch by inch, leaving the ground covered with their\r\ndead. Dick was conscious only of a vast roar and shouting and the\r\ncontinuous blaze of cannon and rifles in his very face. But he\r\nunderstood the immensity of the crisis. By a huge victory in the West\r\nthe Confederacy would redress the loss of Gettysburg in the East. And\r\nnow it seemed that they were gaining it. For the first and only time in\r\nthe war they had the larger numbers in a great battle, and the ground\r\nwas of their own choosing.\r\n\r\nElated over success gained and greater success hoped, the Southern\r\nleaders poured their troops continually upon Thomas. If they could break\r\nthat wing, cut it off in fact, and rush in at the gap, they would be\r\nbetween Rosecrans and Chattanooga and the Northern army would be doomed.\r\nThey made gigantic efforts. The cavalry charged again and again. Huge\r\nmasses of infantry hurled themselves upon the brigades of Thomas, and\r\nevery gun that could be brought into action poured shot and shell into\r\nhis lines.\r\n\r\nMany of the young as well as the old officers in Thomas' corps felt the\r\nterrible nature of the crisis. Dick knew despite the hideous turmoil\r\nthat Thomas was the chief target of the Southern army. He divined that\r\nthe fortunes of the Union were swinging in the balance there among those\r\nTennessee hills and valleys. If Thomas were shattered the turn of Grant\r\nfarther south would come next. Vicksburg would have been won in vain and\r\nthe Union would be broken in the West.\r\n\r\nOrder and cohesion were lost among many of the regiments, but the men\r\nstood firm. The superb, democratic soldier fought for himself and he,\r\ntoo, understood the crisis. They re-formed without orders and fought\r\ncontinuously against overwhelming might. Ground and guns were lost,\r\nbut they made their enemy pay high for everything, and the slow retreat\r\nnever became a panic.\r\n\r\n“We're going back,” shouted Warner in Dick's ear. “Yes, we're going\r\nback, but we'll come forward again. They'll never crush the old man.”\r\n\r\nYet the pressure upon them never ceased. Bragg and his staff had the\r\nright idea. Had anyone but Thomas stood before them they would have\r\nshattered the Union left long since, but his slow, calm mind rose to its\r\ngreatest heights in the greatest danger. He understood everything and\r\nhe was resolved that his wing should not be broken. Wherever the line\r\nseemed weakest he thrust in a veteran regiment, and he went quickly back\r\nand forth, observing with a measuring eye every shift and change of the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment in its new position was still among the gullies\r\nand bushes, and they were thankful for such shelter. Although veterans\r\nnow, most were lads, and they did not scorn to take cover whenever they\r\ncould. For a little while they did not reply to the enemy's fire, but\r\nlay waiting and seeking to get back the breath which seemed to be driven\r\nfrom their bodies by the very violence of the concussion. Shrapnel,\r\ngrape and canister whistled incessantly over their heads, and on either\r\nflank the thunder of the battle swelled rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe Southern attack was spreading along the whole front, and it was made\r\nwith unexampled vigor. It even excelled the fiery rush at Stone River,\r\nand the generals on both sides were largely the same that had fought the\r\nearlier great battle. Polk, the bishop-general, still led one wing for\r\nthe South, Buckner massed Kentuckians who faced Kentuckians on the other\r\nside, and Longstreet and Hill were to play their great part for the\r\nSouth. Resolved to win a victory, the veteran generals spared nothing,\r\nand the little Chickamauga, so singularly named by the Indians “the\r\nriver of death,” was running red.\r\n\r\nDick crouched lower as the storm of shells swept over him. Despite all\r\nhis experience impulse made him bow his head while the whistling death\r\npassed by. He felt a little shame that he, an officer, should seek\r\nprotection, but when he stole a look he saw that all the others, Colonel\r\nWinchester included, were doing the same. Sergeant Whitley had sunk down\r\nthe lowest of them all, and, catching Dick's glance, he said in clear,\r\nlow tones audible under the storm:\r\n\r\n“Pardon me for saying it to you, an officer, Mr. Mason, but it's\r\nour business not to get killed when it's not needed, so we can save\r\nourselves to be killed when it is needed.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you're right, Sergeant. At any rate I'm glad enough to keep\r\nunder cover, but do you see anything in those woods over there? We're on\r\nthe extreme left flank here, and maybe they're trying to overlap us.”\r\n\r\n“I think I do. Men with rifles are in there. I'll speak to the colonel.”\r\n\r\nHe crawled to Colonel Winchester, who was crouched a dozen feet away,\r\nand pointed to the wood, or rather thicket of scrub. But Dick meanwhile\r\nsaw increasing numbers of men there. They were beyond the line of battle\r\nand were not obscured by the clouds of smoke. As he stared he saw a\r\nweazened figure under an enormous, broad-brimmed hat, and, although he\r\ncould not discern the face at the distance, he knew that it was Slade,\r\ncome with a new and perhaps larger body of riflemen to burn away the\r\nextreme left flank of the Union force.\r\n\r\nAs the colonel and the sergeant crawled back Dick told them what he had\r\nseen, and they recognized at once the imminence of the danger. Colonel\r\nWinchester looked at the great columns of fire and smoke in front of\r\nhim. He did not know when the main attack would sweep down upon them\r\nagain, but he took his resolution at once.\r\n\r\nHe ordered his men to wheel about, and, using Slade's own tactics, to\r\ncreep forward with their rifles. Most of his men were sharpshooters and\r\nhe felt that they would be a match for those whom the guerrilla led.\r\nSergeant Whitley kept by his side, and out of a vast experience in\r\nborder warfare advised him.\r\n\r\nDick, Warner and Pennington armed themselves with rifles of the fallen,\r\nand they felt fierce thrills of joy as they crept forward. Burning with\r\nthe battle fever, and enraged against this man Slade, Dick put all his\r\nsoul in the man-hunt. He merely hoped that Victor Woodville was not\r\nthere. He would fire willingly at any of the rest.\r\n\r\nBefore they had gone far Slade and his riflemen began to fire. Bullets\r\npattered all about them, clipping twigs and leaves and striking sparks\r\nfrom stones.\r\n\r\nHad the fire been unexpected it would have done deadly damage, but all\r\nof the Winchesters, as they liked to call themselves, had kept under\r\ncover, and were advancing Indian fashion. And now a consuming rage\r\nseized them all. They felt as if an advantage had been taken of them.\r\nWhile they were fighting a great battle in front a sly foe sought to\r\nambush them. They did not hate the Southern army which charged directly\r\nupon them, but they did hate this band of sharpshooters which had\r\ncome creeping through the woods to pick them off, and they hated them\r\ncollectively and individually.\r\n\r\nIt was Dick's single and fierce desire at that moment to catch sight\r\nof Slade, whom he would shoot without hesitation if the chance came.\r\nHe looked for him continually as he crept from bush to bush, and he\r\nwithheld his fire until fortune might bring into his view the flaps of\r\nthat enormous hat. The whole vast battle of Chickamauga passed from his\r\nmind. He was concentrated, heart and soul, upon this affair of outposts\r\nin the thickets.\r\n\r\nMen around him were firing, and the bullets in return were knocking up\r\nthe leaves about him, but Dick's finger did not yet press the trigger.\r\nThe great hat was still hidden from view, but he heard Slade's whistle\r\ncalling to his men. Sergeant Whitley was by the lad's side, and he\r\nglanced at him now and then. The wise sergeant read the youth's face,\r\nand he knew that he was upon a quest, a deadly one.\r\n\r\n“Is it Slade you're looking for, Mr. Mason?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I want him!”\r\n\r\n“Well, if we see him, and you miss him, I think I'll take a shot at him\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nBut Slade, crafty and cunning, kept himself well hidden. The two bands\r\nfighting this Indian combat, while the great battle raged so near them,\r\nwere now very near to each other, but as they had both thickets and a\r\nrocky outcrop for refuge, they fought from hiding. Nevertheless many\r\nfell. Dick, the ferocity of the man-hunt continuing to burn his brain,\r\nsought everywhere for Slade. Often he heard his silver whistle directing\r\nhis troop, but the man himself remained invisible. In his eagerness the\r\nlad rose too high, but the sergeant pulled him down in time, a bullet\r\nwhistling a second later through the air where his head had been.\r\n\r\n“Careful, Mr. Mason! Careful!” said Sergeant Whitley. “It won't do you\r\nmuch good for one of his men to get you while you are trying to get\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\nDick became more cautious. At last he caught a glimpse of the great hat\r\nthat he could not mistake, and, aiming very carefully, he fired. Then he\r\nuttered an angry cry. He had missed, and when the sergeant was ready to\r\npull the trigger also Slade was gone.\r\n\r\nNow, the colonel called to his men, and rising they charged into the\r\nwood. It was evidently no part of Slade's plan to risk destruction as he\r\nblew a long high call on his whistle, and then he and all his men save\r\nthe dead melted away like shadows. The Winchesters stood among the\r\ntrees, gasping and staunching their wounds, but victorious.\r\n\r\nNow they had only a few moments for rest. Bugles called and they rushed\r\nback to their old position just as the Southern cavalry, sabers circling\r\naloft swept down upon them again. They went once more through that\r\nterrible turmoil of fire and flashing steel, and a second time the\r\nWinchesters were victorious. But they could have stood no more, and\r\nThomas watching everything hurried to their relief a regiment, which\r\nformed up before them to give them breathing time.\r\n\r\nThe young soldiers threw themselves panting upon the ground, and were\r\nassailed by a burning thirst. The canteens were soon emptied, and still\r\ntheir lips and throats were parched. Exhausted by their tremendous\r\nexertions, many of them sank into a stupor, although the battle was at\r\nits zenith and the earth shook with the crash of the heavy batteries.\r\n\r\n“General Thomas has had news that we're driven in elsewhere,” said Dick.\r\n\r\n“And we've yielded ground here, too,” said Warner.\r\n\r\n“But so slowly that it's been only a glacial movement. We've made 'em\r\npay such a high price that I think old 'Pap' can boast he has held his\r\nground.”\r\n\r\nDick did not know it then nor did the general himself, but 'Pap' Thomas\r\ncould boast of far more than having held his ground. His long and\r\nstubborn resistance, his skill in moving his troops from point to point\r\nat the right time, his coolness and judgment in weighing and measuring\r\neverything right, in all the vast turmoil, confusion and uncertainty of\r\na great battle, had saved the Northern army from destruction.\r\n\r\nNow, as the Winchester men lay gasping behind the fresh regiment,\r\nThomas, who continually passed along the line of battle, came among\r\nthem. He was a soldier's soldier, a soldier's general, and he spoke\r\nencouraging words, most of which they could not hear amid the roar of\r\nthe battle, but his calm face told their import, and fresh courage came\r\ninto their hearts.\r\n\r\nThe news spread gradually that Thomas only was holding fast, but now his\r\nmen instead of being discouraged were filled with pride. It was they and\r\nthey alone whom the Southerners could not overwhelm, and Thomas and his\r\ngenerals inspired them with the belief that they were invincible. Charge\r\nafter charge broke against them. More ground was yielded, but at the\r\nsame immense price, and the corps, sullen, indomitable, maintained its\r\norder, always presenting a front to the foe, blazing with death.\r\n\r\nThomas stood all day, while the Southern masses, flushed by victory\r\neverywhere else, pressed harder. Terrible reports of defeat and\r\ndestruction came to him continually, but he did not flinch. He turned\r\nthe same calm face to everything, and said to the generals that whatever\r\nhappened they would keep their own front unbroken.\r\n\r\nThe day closed with the men of Thomas still grim and defiant. The dead\r\nlay in heaps along their front, but as the darkness settled down on the\r\nunfinished battle they meant to fight with equal valor and tenacity on\r\nthe morrow. The first day had favored the South, had favored it largely,\r\nbut on the Union left hope still flamed high.\r\n\r\nDarkness swept over the sanguinary field. A cold wind of autumn blew off\r\nthe hills and mountains, and the men shivered as they lay on the ground,\r\nbut Thomas allowed no fires to be lighted. Food was brought in the\r\ndarkness, and those who could find them wrapped themselves in blankets.\r\nBetween the two armies lay the hecatombs of dead and the thousands of\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nDick, his comrades and the rest of the regiment sat together in a\r\nlittle open space behind a thicket. It was to be their position for\r\nthe fighting next day. Thomas, passing by, had merely given them an\r\napproving look, and then had gone on to re-form his lines elsewhere.\r\nDick knew that all through the night he would be conferring with his\r\ncommander, Rosecrans, McCook and the others, and he knew, too, that\r\nmany of the Union soldiers would be at work, fortifying, throwing up\r\nearthworks, and cutting down trees for abattis. He heard already the\r\nring of the axes.\r\n\r\nBut the Winchester men rested for the present. Nature had made their own\r\nposition strong with a low hill, and a thicket in front. They lay upon\r\nthe ground, sheltering themselves from the cold wind, which cut through\r\nbodies relaxed and almost bloodless after such vast physical exertions\r\nand excitement so tremendous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. THE ROCK OF CHICKAMAUGA\r\n\r\n\r\nDick, after eating the cold food which was served to him, sank into a\r\nstate which was neither sleep nor stupor. It was a mystic region between\r\nthe conscious and the unconscious, in which all things were out of\r\nproportion, and some abnormal.\r\n\r\nHe saw before him a vast stretch of dead blackness which he knew\r\nnevertheless was peopled by armed hosts ready to spring upon them at\r\ndawn. The darkness and silence were more oppressive than sound and\r\nlight, even made by foes, would have been. It numbed him to think there\r\nwas so little of stirring life, where nearly two hundred thousand men\r\nhad fought.\r\n\r\nThen a voice arose that made him shiver. But it was only the cold wind\r\nfrom the mountains whistling a dirge. Nevertheless it seemed human to\r\nDick. It was at once a lament and a rebuke. He edged over a little and\r\ntouched Warner.\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Dick?” asked the Vermonter.\r\n\r\n“What's left of me. I've one or two wounds, mere scratches, George, but\r\nI feel all pumped out. I'm like one of those empty wine-skins that you\r\nread about, empty, all dried up, and ready to be thrown away.”\r\n\r\n“Something of the same feeling myself, Dick. I'm empty and dried up,\r\ntoo, but I'm not ready to be thrown away. Nor are you. We'll fill up in\r\nthe night. Our hearts will pump all our veins full of blood again,\r\nand we'll be ready to go out in the morning, and try once more to get\r\nkilled.”\r\n\r\n“I don't see how you and Pennington and I, all three of us, came out of\r\nit alive to-day.”\r\n\r\n“That question is bothering me, too, Dick. A million bullets were fired\r\nat each of us, not to count thousands of pieces of shell, shrapnel,\r\ncanister, grape, and slashes of swords. Take any ratio of percentage\r\nyou please and something should have got us. According to every rule of\r\nalgebra, not more than one of us three should be alive now. Yet here we\r\nare.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe your algebra is wrong?”\r\n\r\n“Impossible. Algebra is the most exact of all sciences. It does not\r\nadmit of error. Both by algebra and by the immutable law of averages at\r\nleast two of us are dead.”\r\n\r\n“But we don't know which two.”\r\n\r\n“That's true. Nevertheless it's certain that those two, whoever they may\r\nbe, are here on borrowed time. What do your wounds amount to, Dick?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, I had forgotten 'em. I've lost a little blood, but what does\r\nit amount to on a day like this, when blood is shed in rivers?”\r\n\r\n“That's true. My own skin has been broken, but just barely, four times\r\nby bullets. I've a notion that those bullets were coming straight for\r\nsome vital part of me, but seeing who it was, and knowing that such a\r\nnoble character ought not to be slain, they turned aside as quickly as\r\npossible, but not so quickly that they could avoid grazing my skin.”\r\n\r\nDick and Pennington laughed. Warner's fooling amused them and relieved\r\nthe painful tension of their minds.\r\n\r\n“But, George,” said Pennington, “suppose one of the bullets failed to\r\nturn aside and killed you. What could we say then for you?”\r\n\r\n“That it was a silly, ignorant bullet not knowing whence it came, or\r\nwhere it was going. Ah, there's light in the darkness! Look across the\r\nhill and see that shining flame!”\r\n\r\nDick rose and then the three walked to the brow of the hill, where\r\nColonel Winchester stood, using his glasses as well as he could in the\r\ndusk.\r\n\r\n“It's the pine forest on fire in places,” he said. “The shells did it,\r\nand it's been burning for some time, spreading until it has now come\r\ninto our own sight.”\r\n\r\nBut they were detached fires, and they did not fuse into a general mass\r\nat any time. Clumps of trees burnt steadily like vast torches and sent\r\nup high flames. Bands of men from either side worked silently, removing\r\nas many of the wounded as they could. It was a spontaneous movement, as\r\nhappened so often in this war, and Dick and his comrades took a part in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNorth and South met in friendliness in the darkness or by the light of\r\nthe burning pines, and talked freely as they lifted up their wounded.\r\nDick asked often about Colonel Kenton, meeting at last some Kentuckians,\r\nwho told him that the colonel had gone through the day without a wound,\r\nand was with Buckner. Then Dick asked if any Mississippians were along\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\n“What do you want with 'em?” asked a long, lank man with a bilious\r\nyellow face.\r\n\r\n“I've got a friend among 'em. Woodville is his name, and he's about my\r\nown age.”\r\n\r\n“I've heard of the Woodvilles. Big an' rich family in Missip. 'Roun'\r\nVicksburg and Jackson mostly. I'm from the Yazoo valley myself, an' if\r\nI hear of the young fellow I'll send him down this way. But I can't stay\r\nout long, 'cause it'll soon be time for me to have my chill. Comes every\r\nother night reg'lar. But I'll be all right for battle to-morrow, when\r\nwe lick you Yankees out of the other boot, having licked you out of one\r\nto-day.”\r\n\r\n“All right, old Yazoo,” laughed Dick. “Go on and have your chill, but if\r\nyou see Woodville tell him Mason is waiting down here by the wood.”\r\n\r\n“I'll shorely do it, if the chill don't git me fust,” said the yellow\r\nMississippian as he strolled away, and Dick knew that he would keep his\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThe lad lingered at the spot where he had met the man, hoping that by\r\nsome lucky chance Woodville might come, and fortune gave him his wish. A\r\nslender figure emerged from the dark, and a voice called softly:\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Mason?”\r\n\r\n“Nobody else,” replied Dick gladly, stepping forward and offering his\r\nhand, which young Woodville shook warmly. “I was hoping that I might\r\nmeet you, and I see, too, that you can't be hurt much, if at all.”\r\n\r\n“I haven't been touched. It's my lucky day, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Where's your uncle? I hope he's in some safe place, recovering from his\r\nwound.”\r\n\r\nVictor Woodville laughed softly.\r\n\r\n“Uncle Charles is recovering from his wound perhaps faster than you\r\nhope,” he said, “but he's not in a safe place. Far from it.”\r\n\r\n“I don't understand.”\r\n\r\n“His wound is so much better that he can walk, though with a hop, and\r\nhe's right here in the thick of this battle, leading his own Mississippi\r\nregiment. His horse was killed under him early this morning, and he's\r\nfought all day on foot, swearing in the strange and melodious fashion\r\nthat you know. It's hop! swear! hop! swear! in beautiful alternation!”\r\n\r\n“Good old colonel!”\r\n\r\n“That's what he is, and he's also one of the bravest men that ever\r\nlived, if he is my uncle. His regiment did prodigies to-day and they'll\r\ndo greater prodigies to-morrow. The Woodvilles are well represented\r\nhere. My father is present, leading his regiment, and there are a dozen\r\nWoodville cousins of mine whom you've never met.”\r\n\r\n“And I hope I won't meet 'em on this field. What about your aunt?”\r\n\r\n“She's well, and in a safe place.”\r\n\r\n“I'm glad of that. Now, tell me, Victor, how did you happen to be\r\nwith Slade on that raid? Of course it's no business of mine, but I was\r\nsurprised.”\r\n\r\n“I don't mind answering. I suppose it was a taste for adventure, and a\r\ndesire to serve our cause. After I got up the bank and climbed into the\r\nbushes, I looked back, and I think, Mason, that you may have saved me\r\nfrom a bullet. I don't know, but I think so.”\r\n\r\nDick said nothing, but despite the dusk Woodville read the truth in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“I shan't forget,” said the young Mississippian as he moved away.\r\n\r\nDick turned back to his own group. They had noticed him talking to\r\nthe lad in gray, but they paid no attention, nor thought it anything\r\nunusual. It was common enough in the great battles of the American civil\r\nwar, most of which lasted more than one day, for the opposing soldiers\r\nto become friendly in the nights between.\r\n\r\n“I think, sir,” said Sergeant Whitley, “that we won't be able to get any\r\nmore of our wounded to-night. Now, pardon me for saying it, Lieutenant,\r\nbut we ought to have some rest, because when day comes there's going\r\nto be the most awful attack you ever saw. Some of our spies say that\r\nLongstreet and the last of the Virginians did not come until night or\r\nnearly night and that Longstreet himself will lead the attack on us.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think, Sergeant, that it will be made first on our own corps?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know, Mr. Mason. We've stood firmest, and them rebel generals\r\nare no fools. They'll crash in where we've shown the most weakness.”\r\n\r\nThe sergeant walked on, carrying the corner of a litter. Warner, who had\r\nstood by, whispered to Dick:\r\n\r\n“There goes a general, but he'll never have the title. He's got a\r\ngeneral's head on his shoulders, and he thinks and talks like a general,\r\nbut he hasn't any education, and men with much poorer brains go past\r\nhim. Let it be a lesson to you, Dick, my son. After this war, go to\r\nschool, and learn something.”\r\n\r\n“Good advice, George, and I'll take it,” laughed Dick. “But he isn't so\r\nbadly off. I wonder if those fires in the pine forest are going to burn\r\nall night?”\r\n\r\n“Several of 'em will. The big one on our left will be blazing when\r\nday comes, and I'm glad of it since no wounded are now in its way. The\r\nnight's cold. That's a sharp and searching wind, and the sight of flames\r\nmakes one feel warm even if they are far away.”\r\n\r\nIt would not be long until day now, and the axes ceased to ring in the\r\nforest. A long and formidable line of abattis had been made, but the men\r\nwere compelled to seek some rest. Despite the cold they suffered from a\r\nburning thirst, and they could reach no water, not even the red\r\nstream of the Chickamauga. Dick suffered like the rest, but he was\r\nphilosophical.\r\n\r\n“I fancy that after sunrise we won't have time to think about water,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBut Dick was not destined to sleep. He lay down for a while, and he saw\r\nhundreds of others around him lying motionless as if dead. Warner and\r\nPennington were among them, but he could not close his own eyes. His\r\nbrain was still hot and excited, and to calm himself if possible he\r\nwalked along the slope until he saw a faint light in the valley behind\r\nit. A tall figure, which he recognized as that of Colonel Winchester,\r\nwas going toward the light.\r\n\r\nDick, being on such good terms with his colonel, would have followed\r\nhim, but when he came to the edge of the glade he drew back. General\r\nThomas was sitting on the huge, upthrust root of an oak, and he was\r\nwriting dispatches by the light of a flickering candle held by an aide.\r\nOfficers of high rank, one of whom Dick recognized as the young general,\r\nGarfield, stood around him. Colonel Winchester joined the group, and\r\nstood waiting in silence to receive orders, too, Dick supposed.\r\n\r\nThe lad withdrew hastily, but driven by an overmastering curiosity,\r\nand knowing that he was doing no harm, he turned back and watched for a\r\nlittle space beside a bush.\r\n\r\nThe flame of the candle wavered under the wind, and sometimes the light\r\nshone full upon the face of Thomas. It was the same face that Dick had\r\nfirst beheld when he carried the dispatches to him in Kentucky. He was\r\ncalm, inscrutable at this, the most desperate crisis the Union cause\r\never knew in the west. Dick could not see that his hand trembled a\r\nparticle as he wrote, although lieutenant and general alike knew that\r\nthey would soon be attacked by a superior force, flushed with all the\r\nhigh enthusiasm of victory. And lieutenant and general alike also knew\r\nthat their supreme commander, Rosecrans, was no genius like Lee or\r\nJackson, who could set numbers at naught, and choose time and place to\r\nsuit themselves. Only stubborn courage to fight and die could avail.\r\n\r\nBut Dick drew courage from the strong, thick figure sitting there so\r\nimpassively and apparently impervious to alarm. When he quit writing\r\nand began to give verbal orders, he spoke in even tones, in which no\r\none could detect a trace of excitement. When the name, “The Rock of\r\nChickamauga,” became general, Dick remembered that night and knew how\r\nwell it was deserved.\r\n\r\nThomas gave his last order and his generals went to their commands. Dick\r\nslipped back to his regiment, and lay down, but again could not sleep.\r\n\r\nHe waited in painful anxiety for the day. He had never before been\r\nin such a highly nervous state, not at Shiloh, nor Stone River, nor\r\nanywhere else. In those battles the chances were with the Union, but\r\nhere they were against it. He recognized that once more, save for\r\nThomas, the North had been outgeneraled. The army of Rosecrans had\r\nmarched from Chattanooga directly upon the positions chosen by Bragg,\r\nwhere he was awaiting them with superior numbers. And the Confederate\r\ngovernment in the East had been quick enough to seize the opportunity\r\nand quick enough to send the stalwart fighter, Longstreet, and his corps\r\nto help close down the trap.\r\n\r\nHe wondered with many a painful throbbing of the heart what the dawn\r\nwould bring, and, unable to keep still any longer, he rose and went to\r\nthe brow of the low hill, behind which they lay. Colonel Winchester was\r\nthere walking through the scrub and trying to pick out something in\r\nthe opposing forest with his glasses. The cold wind still blew from\r\nthe mountains, and there were three high but distant torches, where the\r\nclumps of pines still burned.\r\n\r\n“Restless, Dick?” said the Colonel. “Well, so am I.”\r\n\r\n“We have cause to be so, sir.”\r\n\r\n“So we have, my lad. We thought the danger to the Union had passed with\r\nVicksburg and Gettysburg, but the day so soon to come may shatter all\r\nour hopes. They must have a hundred thousand men out there, and they've\r\nchosen time and place. What's more, they've succeeded so far. I don't\r\nhesitate to talk to you in this way, Dick, but you mustn't repeat what I\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn't dream of doing so, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I know you would not, but General Thomas apprehends a tremendous and\r\nterrible attack. Whatever happens, we have not long to wait for it. I\r\nthink I feel the touch of the dawn in the wind.”\r\n\r\n“It's coming, sir. I can see a faint tinge of gray in that cleft between\r\nthe hills toward the east.”\r\n\r\n“You have a good eye, Dick. I see it now, too. It's growing and\r\nturning to the color of silver. But I think we'll have time to get our\r\nbreakfasts. General Thomas does not believe the first attack will be\r\nmade upon our wing.”\r\n\r\nThe wind was freshening, as if it brought the dawn upon its edge.\r\nThe night had been uncommonly cold for the time of the year in that\r\nlatitude, and there was no sun yet to give warmth. But the men of Thomas\r\nwere being awakened, and, as no fires were allowed, cold food was served\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n“What's happened, Dick, while I was asleep?” asked Pennington.\r\n\r\n“Nothing. The two armies are ready, and I think to-day will decide it.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so. Two days are enough for any battle.”\r\n\r\nPennington's tone was jocular, but his words were not. His face was\r\ngrave as he regarded the opposing forest. He had the feeling of youth\r\nthat others might be killed, but not he. Nevertheless he was already\r\nmourning many a good comrade who would be lost before the night came\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“There are the wasps!” said Warner, bending a listening ear. “You can\r\nalways hear them as they begin to sting. I wonder if skirmishers ever\r\nsleep?”\r\n\r\nThe shots were on the right, but they came from points far away. In\r\nfront of them the forest and hills were silent.\r\n\r\n“It's just as General Thomas thought,” said Dick. “The main volume of\r\ntheir attack will be on our right and center. They know that Thomas\r\nstands here and that he's a mighty rock, hard to move. They expect to\r\nshatter all the rest of the line, and then whirl and annihilate us.”\r\n\r\n“Let 'em come!” exclaimed Warner, with heightening color. “Who's\r\nafraid?”\r\n\r\nThe dawn was spreading. The heavy mists that hung over the Chickamauga\r\nfloated away. All the east was silver, and the darkness rolled back like\r\na blanket. The west became silver in its turn, and the sun burned red\r\nfire in the east. The wind still blew fresh and cool off the mountains.\r\nThe faint sound of trumpets came from far points on the Southern line.\r\nThe crackling fire of the skirmishers increased.\r\n\r\n“It's a wait for us,” said Colonel Winchester, standing amid his\r\nyouthful staff. “I can see them advancing in great columns against our\r\nright and center. Now their artillery opens!”\r\n\r\nDick put up his glasses and he, too, saw the mighty Southern army\r\nadvancing. Their guns were already clearing the way for the advance,\r\nand the valleys echoed with the great concussion. Longstreet and Hill,\r\nanxious to show what the veterans of the East could do, were pouring\r\nthem forward alive with all the fire and courage that had distinguished\r\nthem in the Army of Northern Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe battle swelled fast. It seemed to the waiting veterans of Thomas\r\nthat it had burst forth suddenly like a volcano. They saw the vast\r\nclouds of smoke gather again off there where their comrades stood, and,\r\nknowing the immense weight about to be hurled upon them, they feared for\r\nthose men who had fought so often by their side.\r\n\r\nYet Thomas had been confident that the first attack would be made upon\r\nhis own part of the line, that Bragg with an overwhelming force would\r\nseek to roll up his left. Nor had he reckoned wrong. The lingering of\r\nthe bishop-general, Polk, over a late breakfast saved him from the first\r\nshock, and upset the plans of the Southern commander, who had given him\r\nstrict orders to advance.\r\n\r\nDawn was long past, and to Bragg's great astonishment Polk had not\r\nmoved. It seems incredible that the fate of great events can turn upon\r\nsuch trifles, and yet one wonders what would have happened had not Polk\r\neaten breakfast so late the morning of the second day of Chickamauga.\r\nBut when he did advance he attacked with the energy and vigor of\r\nthose great churchmen of the Middle Ages, who were at once princes and\r\nwarriors, leading their hosts to battle.\r\n\r\nPortions of the men of Thomas were now coming into the combat, but the\r\nWinchesters were not yet engaged. They were lying down just behind the\r\ncrest of their low hill and many murmurs were running through the ranks.\r\nIt was the hardest of all things to wait, while shells now and then\r\nstruck among them. They saw to their right the vast volume of fire and\r\nsmoke, while the roaring of the cannon and rifles was like the continued\r\nsweep of a storm.\r\n\r\nThe youthful soldier may be nervous and excited, or he may be calm. This\r\nwas one of Dick's calm moments, and, while he watched and listened and\r\ntried to measure all that he saw and heard, he noted that the crash of\r\nthe battle was moving slowly backward. He knew then that the Southern\r\nadvance was succeeding, succeeding so far at least. He was quite sure\r\nnow that the attack upon Thomas would be made soon and that it would\r\ncome with the greatest violence.\r\n\r\nHe rose and rejoined Colonel Winchester again, and the two looked with\r\nawe at the gigantic combat, raging in a vast canopy of smoke, rent\r\ncontinuously by flashes of fire. Dick observed that the colonel was\r\ndepressed and he knew the reason.\r\n\r\n“Our men are being driven back,” he said.\r\n\r\n“So they are,” said the colonel, “and I fear that there is confusion\r\namong them, too.”\r\n\r\n“But we'll hold fast here as we did yesterday!”\r\n\r\n“I hope so. Yes, I know so, Dick. I've seen General Thomas twice this\r\nmorning, and I know that this corps will never be routed. He's made up\r\nhis mind to hold on or die. He's the Rock of Chickamauga.”\r\n\r\nIt was a name that Dick was to hear often afterward, and he repeated\r\nunder his breath: “The Rock of Chickamauga! The Rock of Chickamauga!” It\r\nrolled resoundingly off the tongue, and he liked it.\r\n\r\nThen came a beat of hoofs and a cavalry regiment galloped into open\r\nground beside them. It was Colonel Hertford's, numbering about three\r\nhundred men, some of whom were wounded. Their leader was excited, and,\r\nspringing to the ground, he ran to Colonel Winchester. The two talked in\r\nquick, short sentences.\r\n\r\n“Colonel,” exclaimed Hertford, “we've just had a sharp brush with that\r\ndemon, Forrest, and we've left some good men back there. But I've come\r\nboth to help and to warn you. We're being driven back everywhere else,\r\nand now they're gathering an immense mass of troops for a gigantic\r\nattack on Thomas!”\r\n\r\nDick heard and his breath came fast. Colonel Hertford would bring\r\nno false news, and he could see with his own eyes that the storm was\r\ncurving toward them. The two men hurried to Thomas, but in a few minutes\r\nreturned. Colonel Hertford sprang into the saddle and formed his cavalry\r\non the flank as a screen against the dreaded sweep of Forrest.\r\n\r\nThere was a lull for a moment in the tremendous uproar, and, Colonel\r\nWinchester walking back and forth before his men, spoke to them briefly.\r\nHe was erect, pale and handsome, and his words came without a quiver.\r\nDick had never admired him more.\r\n\r\n“Men,” he said, “you have never been beaten in battle, but your greatest\r\ntest is now at hand. Within a few minutes you will be attacked by a\r\nforce outnumbering you more than two to one. But these are the odds we\r\nlove. We would not have them less. I tell you, speaking as a man to men\r\nwho understand and fear not, that the fate of the day may rest with you.\r\nMany gallant comrades of ours have gone already to the far shore, and\r\nif we must go, too, to-day, let our journey be not less gallant than\r\ntheirs. We can die but once, and if we must die, let us die here where\r\nwe can serve our country most.”\r\n\r\nHis manner was quiet, but his words were thrilling, and the men of the\r\nregiment, springing to their feet, uttered a deep, full-throated cheer.\r\nThen sinking down again at the motion of his hand, they turned their\r\nfaces to the enemy. The time had come.\r\n\r\nThe vast Southern front rushed from the wood, and the gray horsemen of\r\nForrest, careless of death, swept down. It was a terrifying sight,\r\nthat army coming on amid the thunder and lightning of battle, tens of\r\nthousands of rifle muzzles, tens of thousands of fierce brown faces\r\nshowing through the smoke, and the tremendous battle yell of the South\r\nswelling over everything.\r\n\r\nDick felt a quiver, and then his body stiffened, as if it were about to\r\nreceive a physical shock. The whole regiment fired as one man, and a gap\r\nappeared in the charging Southern column. Hertford and his horse\r\ncharged upon the hostile cavalry, and all the brigades of Thomas met the\r\nSouthern attack with a fire so heavy and deadly that the army of Bragg\r\nreeled back.\r\n\r\nThen ensued the most tremendous scene through which Dick had yet passed.\r\nThe Southern army came again. Bragg, Breckinridge, Buckner, Longstreet,\r\nHill, Cleburne and the others urged on the attacks. They had been\r\nvictors everywhere else and they knew that they must drive back Thomas\r\nor the triumph would not be complete. They struck and spared not, least\r\nof all their own men. They poured them, Kentuckians, Tennesseeans,\r\nGeorgians, Mississippians and all the rest upon Thomas without regard to\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nKentuckians on the opposing sides met once again face to face. Dick did\r\nnot know it then, but a regiment drawn from neighboring counties charged\r\nthe Winchesters thrice and left their dead almost at his feet. He had\r\nlittle time to notice or measure anything amid the awful din and the\r\ncontinued shock of battle in which thousands of men were falling.\r\n\r\nThe clouds of smoke enveloped them at times, and at other times floated\r\naway. New clumps of pines, set on fire by the shells, burned brightly\r\nlike torches, lighting the way to death. Smoke, thick with the odors of\r\nburned gunpowder clogged eye, nose and throat. Dick and the lads around\r\nhim gasped for breath, but they fired so fast into the dense Southern\r\nmasses that their rifle barrels grew hot to the touch.\r\n\r\nThe South was making her supreme effort. Her western sons were\r\nperforming prodigies of valor, and Longstreet and the Virginians were\r\nfighting with all the courage that had distinguished them in the East.\r\n\r\nBut however violent the charge, and however tremendous the fire of\r\ncannon and rifles, the Rock of Chickamauga merely sank deeper in the\r\nsoil, and nothing could drive him from his base. The Union dead heaped\r\nup, regiments were shattered by the Southern fire, but Thomas, calm,\r\nand, inspiring courage as on the day before, passed here and there,\r\nstrengthening the weak points, and sending many great guns to the crest\r\nof Missionary Ridge, whence they swept the front of the enemy with a\r\ndevastating fire.\r\n\r\nThe hail of death from the heights enabled the infantry and cavalry\r\nbelow to gather breath and strength for the new attacks of the enemy.\r\nThey knew, too, that their cannon were now giving them more help than\r\nbefore, and defiant cheers swept along the line in answer to the mighty\r\nbattle cry of the South. The Rock of Chickamauga had not moved a foot.\r\n\r\nDick caught gleams of the sun through the smoky canopy, but he did not\r\nknow how far the day had advanced. He seemed to have been in battle\r\nmany hours, but in such moments one had little knowledge of time. He was\r\naware that the battle had been lost in the center and on the right, but\r\nhe had sublime faith in Thomas. The left would stand, and while it stood\r\nthe South could win but a barren triumph.\r\n\r\nThe peril was imminent and deadly. A strong Southern force, having cut\r\nthrough another portion of the line, was endeavoring to take Thomas\r\non the flank. Rosecrans, seeing the danger and almost in despair, sent\r\nThomas orders which his stern lieutenant fortunately could not obey. The\r\nrock did not move.\r\n\r\nBragg, an able leader, increased the attack upon Thomas. His generals\r\ngathered around him, and seconded his efforts. Their view was better\r\nthan that of the Union commanders, and they knew it was vital to them\r\nto move the rock from their path. Brigades, already victorious on other\r\nparts of the field, came up, and were hurled, shouting their triumphant\r\nbattle cry against Thomas, only to be hurled back again.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the defenders increased with their success. A sort of\r\nfever seized upon them all. Death had become a little thing, or it was\r\nforgotten. The blood in their veins was fire, and, transported out of\r\nthemselves, they rained shells and bullets upon men whom in their calm\r\nmoments they did not hate at all.\r\n\r\nDick's regiment had suffered with the rest, but Pennington and Warner\r\nand the colonel were alive, and he caught a few glimpses of Hertford\r\nwith his gallant horsemen beating back every attack upon their flank.\r\nBut nothing stood out with sharp precision. The whole was a huge turmoil\r\nof fire, smoke, confusion and death. The weight upon them seemed at\r\nlast to become overwhelming. In spite of courage the most heroic, and\r\ndreadful losses, the right of Thomas was driven back, his center was\r\ncompelled to wheel about, but his left where the Winchester regiment\r\nstood with others held on. Thomas himself was there among them, still\r\ncool and impassive in face of threatened ruin.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty thousand men were around Thomas, and they alone stood\r\nbetween the Union army and destruction. At all other points it had been\r\nnot only defeated, but routed. Vast masses of fugitives were fleeing\r\ntoward Chattanooga. Rosecrans himself withdrew, and, now wholly in\r\ndespair, telegraphed at four o'clock in the afternoon to Washington: “My\r\narmy has been whipped and routed.”\r\n\r\nBut Thomas was neither routed nor whipped. Many of the brave generals\r\nelsewhere refused to flee with the troops, but gathering as many\r\nsoldiers as possible joined Thomas. Among them was young Sheridan,\r\ndestined to so great a fame, who brought almost all his own division and\r\nstood beside the Rock of Chickamauga, refusing to yield any further to\r\nthe terrible pressure.\r\n\r\nThe line of Thomas' army was now almost a semicircle. Polk was leading\r\nviolent attacks upon his left and center. Longstreet, used to victory,\r\nwas upon his right and behind him, and the veterans from the Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia had never fought better.\r\n\r\nDick saw the enemy all around him, and he began to lose hope. How could\r\nthey stand against such numbers? And if they tried to retreat there was\r\nLongstreet to cut off the way. He bumped against Sergeant Whitley in the\r\nsmoke and gasped out:\r\n\r\n“We're done for, Sergeant! We're done for!”\r\n\r\n“No, we're not!” shouted the sergeant, firing into the advancing mass.\r\n“We'll beat 'em back. They can't run over us!”\r\n\r\nThe sergeant, usually so cool, was a little mad. He was wounded in the\r\nhead, and the blood had run down over his face, dyeing it scarlet. His\r\nbrain was hot as with fire, and he hurled epithets at the enemy. His\r\nlife on the plains came back to him, and, for the time, he was like a\r\nhurt Sioux chief who defies his foes. He called them names. He dared\r\nthem to come on. He mocked them. He told them how they had attacked\r\nin vain all day long. He counted the number of their repulses and then\r\nexaggerated them. He reminded them it was yet a long time until dark,\r\nand asked them why they hesitated, why they did not come forward and\r\nmeet the death that was ready for them.\r\n\r\nDick gazed at him in astonishment. He heard many of his words through\r\nthe roar of the guns, and he saw his ensanguined face, through which\r\nhis eyes burned like two red-hot coals. Was this the quiet and kindly\r\nSergeant Whitley whom he had known so long? No, it was a raging tiger.\r\nStill waters run deep, and, enveloped, at last, with the fury of battle\r\nthe sergeant welcomed wounds, death or anything else it might bring.\r\n\r\nHe shouted and fired his rifle again. Then he fell like a log. Dick\r\nrushed to him at once, but he saw that he had only fainted from loss of\r\nblood. He bound up the sergeant's head as best he could, and, easing him\r\nagainst a bank, returned to the battle front.\r\n\r\nA shout suddenly arose. Officers had seen through their glasses a column\r\nof dust rising far behind them. It was so vast that it could only be\r\nmade by a great body of marching troops. But who were the men that were\r\nmaking it? In all the frightful din and excitement of the battle the\r\nquestion ran through the army of Thomas. If fresh enemies were coming\r\nupon their rear they were lost! If friends there was yet hope!\r\n\r\nBut they could not watch the tower of dust long. The enemy in front gave\r\nthem no chance. Polk was still beating upon them, and Longstreet,\r\nhaving seized a ridge, was pouring an increased fire from his advanced\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n“If that cloud of dust encloses gray uniforms we're lost!” shouted\r\nWarner in Dick's ear.\r\n\r\n“But it mustn't enclose 'em,” Dick shouted back. “Fate wouldn't play us\r\nsuch an awful trick! We can't lose, after having done and suffered so\r\nmuch!”\r\n\r\nFate would not say which. They could not send men to see, but as they\r\nfought they watched the cloud coming nearer and nearer, and Dick,\r\nwhose lips had been moving for some time, realized suddenly that he was\r\npraying. “O God, save us! save us!” he was saying over and over. “Send\r\nthe help to us who need it so sorely. Make us strong, O God, to meet our\r\nenemies!”\r\n\r\nHe and all his comrades wore masks of dust and burned gunpowder, often\r\nstained with scarlet. Their clothing was torn by bullets and reddened\r\nby dripping wounds. When they shouted to one another their voices came\r\nstrained and husky from painful throats. Half the time they were blinded\r\nby the smoke and blaze of the firing. The crash did not seem so loud to\r\nthem now, because they were partly deafened for the time by a cannonade\r\nof such violence and length.\r\n\r\nDick looked back once more at the great cloud of dust which was now much\r\nnearer, but there was nothing yet to indicate what it bore within, the\r\nbayonets of the North or those of the South. His anxiety became almost\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nThomas himself stood at that moment entirely alone in a clump of trees\r\non the elevation called Horseshoe Ridge, watching the battle, seeing the\r\nenemy in overpowering numbers on both his flanks and even in his\r\nrear. Apparently everything was lost. Taciturn, he never described his\r\nfeelings then, but in his soul he must have admired the magnificent\r\ncourage with which his troops stood around him, and repelled the\r\ndesperate assaults of a foe resolved to win. Although his face\r\ngrew grimmer and his teeth set hard, he, too, must have watched the\r\napproaching cloud of dust with the most terrible anxiety. If it bore\r\nenemies in its bosom, then in very truth everything would be lost.\r\n\r\nDown a road some miles from the battlefield a force of eight thousand\r\nmen had been left as a reserve for one of the armies. They had long\r\nheard the terrific cannonade which was sending shattering echoes through\r\nthe mountains, and both their chief and his second in command were eager\r\nto rush to the titanic combat. They could not obtain orders from their\r\ncommander, but, at last, they marched swiftly to the field, all the\r\neight thousand on fire with zeal to do their part.\r\n\r\nIt was the eight thousand who were making the great cloud of dust,\r\nand, as they came nearer and nearer, the suspense of Thomas' shattered\r\nbrigades grew more terrible. Dick, reckless of shell and bullets, tried\r\nto pierce the cloud with his eyes. He caught a glimpse of a flag and\r\nuttered a wild shout of joy. It was the stars and stripes. The eight\r\nthousand were eight thousand of the North! He danced up and down on the\r\nstump, and shouted at the top of his voice:\r\n\r\n“They're our own men! Help is here! Help is here!”\r\n\r\nA vast shout of relief rose from Thomas' army as the eight thousand\r\nstill coming swiftly joined them. Granger was their leader, but\r\nSteedman, his lieutenant, galloped at once to Thomas, who still stood in\r\nthe clump of trees, and asked him what he wanted him to do. The general,\r\ncalm and taciturn as ever, pointed toward a long hill that flamed with\r\nthe enemy's guns, and said three words:\r\n\r\n“Take that ridge!”\r\n\r\nSteedman galloped back and the eight thousand charged at once. The\r\nbattle in front sank a little, as if the others wished to watch the new\r\ncombat. Dick had been dragged down from the stump by Warner, but the two\r\nstood erect with Pennington, their eyes turned toward the ridge. Colonel\r\nWinchester was near them, his attention fixed upon the same place.\r\n\r\nThe eight thousand firing their rifles and supported by artillery\r\ncharged at a great pace. The whole ridge blazed with fire, and the\r\ndead and wounded went down in sheaves. But Dick could not see that they\r\nfaltered. Hoarse shouts came again from his dry and blackened lips:\r\n\r\n“They will take it! they will take it! Look how they face the guns!” he\r\nwas crying.\r\n\r\n“So they will!” said Warner. “See what a splendid charge! Now they're\r\nhidden! What a column of smoke! It floats aside, and, look, our men are\r\nstill going on! Nothing can stop them! They must have lost thousands,\r\nbut they reach the slope, and as sure as there's a sun in the heavens\r\nthey're going up it!”\r\n\r\nThat tremendous cheer burst again from the beleaguered Union army.\r\nGranger and Steedman, with their fresh troops, were rushing up the\r\nslopes of the formidable ridge, and though three thousand of the eight\r\nthousand fell, they took it, hurling back the advancing columns of the\r\nSouth, and securing the rear of Thomas.\r\n\r\nThen the Winchester men and others about them went wild with joy. They\r\nleaped, they danced, they sang, until they were commanded to make ready\r\nfor a new attack. Rosecrans in Chattanooga, with the most of his army\r\nthere also in wild confusion, had sent word to Thomas to retire, to\r\nwhich Thomas had replied tersely: “It will ruin the army to withdraw it\r\nnow; this position must be held till night.”\r\n\r\nAnd he made good his resolve. The Southern masses attacked once more\r\nwith frightful violence, and once more Thomas withstood them. The field\r\nwas now darkening in the twilight, and, having saved the Union army\r\nfrom rout and wreck, Thomas, impervious to attack, fell back slowly to\r\nChattanooga.\r\n\r\nThe greatest battle of the West, one of the most desperate ever fought,\r\ncame to a close. Thirty-five thousand men, killed or wounded, had fallen\r\nupon the field. The South had won a great but barren victory. She had\r\nnot been able to reap the fruits of so much skill and courage, because\r\nThomas and his men, like the Spartans at Thermopylae, had stood in the\r\nway. Never had a man more thoroughly earned the title of honor that he\r\nbore throughout the rest of his life, “The Rock of Chickamauga.”\r\n\r\nChickamauga, though, was a sinister word to the North. Gettysburg and\r\nVicksburg had stemmed the high tide of the Confederacy, and many had\r\nthought the end in sight. But the news from “The River of Death” told\r\nthem that the road to crowning success was still long and terrible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. BESIDE THE BROOK\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the slow retreat began Dick looked for the sergeant. But a stalwart\r\nfigure, a red bandage around the head, rose up and confronted him. It\r\nwas Sergeant Whitley himself, a little unsteady yet on his feet, but\r\nsoon to be as good as ever.\r\n\r\n“Thank you for looking for me, Mr. Mason,” he said, “but I came to, some\r\ntime ago. I guess the bullet found my skull too hard, 'cause it just ran\r\n'roun' it, and came out on the other side. I won't even be scarred, as\r\nmy hair covers up the place.”\r\n\r\n“Can you walk all right?” asked Dick, overjoyed to find the sergeant was\r\nnot hurt badly.\r\n\r\n“Of course I can, Mr. Mason, an' I'm proud to have been with General\r\nThomas in such a battle. I didn't think human bein's could do what our\r\nmen have done.”\r\n\r\n“Nor did I. It was impossible, but we've done it all the same.”\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester rejoiced no less than the lads over the sergeant's\r\nescape. All the officers of the regiment liked him, and they had an\r\ninfinite respect for his wisdom, particularly when danger was running\r\nhigh. They were glad for his own sake that he was alive, and they were\r\nglad to have him with them as they retreated into Chattanooga, because\r\nthe night still had its perils.\r\n\r\nThe moon, though clouded, was out as they withdrew slowly. On their\r\nflanks there was still firing, as strong detachments skirmished with one\r\nanother, but the Winchester men as yet paid little attention to it. They\r\nsaid grimly to one another that two days in the infernal regions were\r\nenough for one time. They looked back at the vast battlefield and the\r\nclumps of pines burning now like funeral torches, and shuddered.\r\n\r\nThe retreat of Thomas was harried incessantly. Longstreet and Forrest\r\nwere eager to push the attack that night and the next day and make the\r\nvictory complete. They and men of less rank dreamed of a triumph which\r\nshould restore the fortunes of the Confederacy to the full, but Bragg\r\nwas cautious. He did not wish to incur the uttermost risk, and the roll\r\nof his vast losses might well give him pause also.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Southern infantry and cavalry hung on the flanks and rear\r\nof the withdrawing Union force. The cloudy moon gave sufficient light\r\nfor the sharpshooters, whose rifles flashed continuously. The lighter\r\nfield guns moved from the forests and bushes, and the troops of Thomas\r\nwere compelled to turn again and again to fight them off.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester regiment was on the extreme flank, where the men were\r\nexposed to the fiercest attacks, but fortunately the thickets and hills\r\ngave them much shelter. At times they lay down and returned the fire\r\nof the enemy until they beat him off. Then they would rise and march on\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAll the officers had lost their horses, and Colonel Winchester strode\r\nat the head of his men. Just behind were Dick, Pennington and some other\r\nmembers of his staff. The rest had fallen. Further back was Sergeant\r\nWhitley, his head in a red bandage, but all his faculties returned.\r\nIn this dire emergency he was taking upon himself the duties of a\r\ncommissioned officer, and there was none to disobey him. Once more was\r\nthe wise veteran showing himself a very bulwark of strength.\r\n\r\nDespite the coolness of the night, they had all suffered on the second\r\nday of the battle from a burning thirst. And now after their immense\r\nexertions it grew fiercer than ever. Dick's throat and mouth were\r\nparched, and he felt as if he were breathing fire. He felt that he must\r\nhave water or die. All the men around him were panting, and he knew they\r\nwere suffering the same torture.\r\n\r\n“This country ought to be full of brooks and creeks,” he said to\r\nPennington. “If I see water I mean to make a dash for it, Johnnies or no\r\nJohnnies. I'm perfectly willing to risk my life for a drink.”\r\n\r\n“So am I,” said Warner, who overheard him, “and so are all who are left\r\nin this regiment. If they see the flash of water nothing can hold them\r\nback, not even Bragg's whole army. How those skirmishers hang on to us!\r\nWhizz-z! there went their bullets right over our head!”\r\n\r\nThe Winchesters turned, delivered a heavy volley into a thicket, whence\r\nthe bullets had come, and marched on, looking eagerly now for water.\r\nThey began to talk about it. They spoke of the cool brooks, “branches”\r\n they called them, that they had known at home, and they told how, when\r\nthey found one, they would first drink of it, and then lie down in its\r\nbed and let its water flow over them.\r\n\r\nBut Dick's thirst could not wholly take his mind from the tremendous\r\nscenes accompanying that sullen and defiant retreat. Hills and mountains\r\nwere in deepest gloom, save when the signal lights of the Southern\r\narmies flashed back and forth. The clouded moon touched everything\r\nnearer by with somber gray. The fire of cannon rolled through the forest\r\nand gorges with redoubled echoes.\r\n\r\nA shout suddenly came from the head of the Winchester column.\r\n\r\n“Water! Water!” they cried. A young boy had caught a glimpse of silver\r\nthrough some bushes, and he knew that it was made by the swift current\r\nof a brook. In an instant the regiment broke into a run for the water.\r\nColonel Winchester could not have stopped them if he had tried, and he\r\ndid not try. He knew how great was their need.\r\n\r\n“We're off!” cried Pennington.\r\n\r\n“I see it! The water!” shouted Dick.\r\n\r\n“I do, too!” exclaimed Warner, “and it's the most beautiful water that\r\never flowed!”\r\n\r\nBut they stopped in their rush and dropped down in the thickets.\r\nSergeant Whitley had given the warning shout, and fortunately most of a\r\nvolley from a point about a hundred yards beyond the stream swept over\r\ntheir heads. A few men were wounded, and they not badly.\r\n\r\nDick crawled to the head of the column. The sergeant was already there,\r\nwhispering to Colonel Winchester.\r\n\r\n“They've taken to cover, too, sir,” said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n“How many do you suppose they are?” asked the colonel.\r\n\r\n“Not more than we are, sir.”\r\n\r\n“They run a great risk when they attack us in this manner.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe, sir,” said Dick, “they, too, were coming for the water.”\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester looked at Sergeant Whitley.\r\n\r\n“I'm of the opinion, sir,” said the sergeant, “that Mr. Mason is right.”\r\n\r\n“I think so, too,” said Colonel Winchester. “It's a pity that men should\r\nkill each other over a drink of water when there's enough for all. Has\r\nany man a handkerchief?”\r\n\r\n“Here, sir,” said Warner; “it's ragged and not very clean, but I hope it\r\nwill do.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel raised the handkerchief on the point of his sword and gave\r\na hail. The bulk of the two armies had passed on, and now there was\r\nsilence in the woods as the two little forces confronted each other\r\nacross the stream.\r\n\r\nDick saw a tall form in Confederate gray rise up from the bushes on the\r\nother side of the brook.\r\n\r\n“Are you wanting to surrender?” the man called in a long, soft drawl.\r\n\r\n“Not by any means. We want a drink of water, and we're just bound to\r\nhave it.”\r\n\r\n“You don't want it any more than we do, and you're not any more bound to\r\nhave it than we are.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel hesitated a moment, and then, influenced by a generous\r\nimpulse, said:\r\n\r\n“If you won't fire, we won't.”\r\n\r\nThe tall, elderly Southerner, evidently a colonel, also said:\r\n\r\n“It's a fair proposition, sir. My men have been working so hard the last\r\ntwo days licking you Yanks that they're plum' burnt up with thirst.”\r\n\r\n“I don't admit the licking, although it's obvious that you've gained\r\nthe advantage so far, but is it agreed that we shall have a truce for a\r\nquarter of an hour?”\r\n\r\n“It is, sir; the truce of the water, and may we drink well! Come on,\r\nboys!”\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester gave a similar order to his men, and each side rose\r\nfrom the thickets, and made a rush for the brook. It was a beautiful\r\nlittle stream, the most beautiful in the world just then to Dick and his\r\nfriends. Clear and cold, the color of silver in the moonlight, it rushed\r\ndown from the mountains. On one side knelt the men in blue, and on the\r\nother the men in gray, and the pure water was like the elixir of heaven\r\nto their parched and burning throats.\r\n\r\nDick drank long, and then as he raised his face from the stream he saw\r\nopposite him a tall, lean youth, evidently from the far South, Louisiana\r\nperhaps, a lad with a tanned face and a wide mouth stretched in a\r\nfriendly grin.\r\n\r\n“Tastes good, doesn't it, Yank?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it does, Reb,” replied Dick. “I felt that I was drying up and just\r\ncrumbling away like old dead wood. As soon as the gallon that I've drunk\r\nhas percolated thoroughly through my system I intend to hoist aboard\r\nanother gallon.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know what percolate means, but I reckon it has something to\r\ndo with travelin' about through your system. I think I need a couple of\r\ngallons myself. Say, will you give a fair answer to a fair question?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, go ahead.”\r\n\r\n“Don't you Yanks feel powerful bad over the thrashing we've given you?”\r\n\r\n“Not so bad. Besides I wouldn't call it a thrashing. It's just a\r\ntemporary advantage. And you wait. We'll take it away from you.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know about that, but I can't argue with you now. I'm due for my\r\nsecond gallon.”\r\n\r\n“So am I.”\r\n\r\nEach bent down and drank again a long, life-giving draught from the\r\nrushing stream. For a distance of a hundred yards or more heads black,\r\nbrown and sometimes yellow were bent over the brook. Far off, both\r\nto east and west, the cannon thundered in the darkness, but with the\r\ndrinkers it was a peaceful interlude of a quarter of an hour. Such\r\nmoments often occurred in this war when the men on both sides were blood\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\nColonel Winchester stood up, and the grizzled Confederate colonel stood\r\nup on the other side of the stream, facing him. Their hands rose in a\r\nsimultaneous salute of respect.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Colonel Winchester, “I'm happy to have met you in this\r\nmanner.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the Southern colonel ornately, “we are happy to have drunk\r\nfrom the same stream with such brave foes, and now, sir, I propose as\r\nwe retire that neither regiment shall fire a shot within the next five\r\nminutes.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed,” said Colonel Winchester, and then as the colonels gave the\r\nsignals the two regiments withdrew beyond their respective thickets.\r\nThe truce of the water was over, but these foes did not meet again that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe regiment had left a great proportion of its numbers dead upon the\r\nfield. Half the others were wounded more or less, but the slightly\r\nwounded marched on with the unhurt. Many of them were now barely\r\nconscious. They were either asleep upon their feet or in a daze.\r\nNevertheless they soon rejoined the main command.\r\n\r\nDick, having his pride as an officer, sought to keep himself active and\r\nalert. He passed among the lads of his own age, and encouraged them. He\r\ntold them how the older men were already speaking of the wonders they\r\nhad done, and presently he saw Thomas himself riding along with the\r\nyoung general, Garfield, who had been with him throughout the afternoon.\r\nAll the Winchester men saw their commander, and, worn as they were, they\r\nstopped and gave a mighty cheer. Thomas was moved. Under the cloudy moon\r\nDick saw him show emotion for the first time. He took off his hat.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, comrades,” he said, “we have lost the battle of Chickamauga,\r\nbut if all our regiments fight as you fought to-day the war is won.”\r\n\r\nAnother cheer, enthusiastic and spontaneous, burst from the regiment,\r\nand Thomas rode on. Dick had never heard him make another speech so\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the little town of Chattanooga within its mountains\r\nthey began to realize the full grandeur of their exploit. The remainder\r\nof the army of Rosecrans was almost a mob, and brave as he undoubtedly\r\nwas he was soon removed to another field, leaving Thomas in supreme\r\ncommand until Grant should come.\r\n\r\nDick had no rest until the next night, when tents were set for the\r\nbattered remains of the Winchester regiment. He, Warner, Pennington\r\nand three others were assigned to one of the larger tents. He had been\r\nwithout sleep for two days and two nights, and the tremendous tension\r\nthat had kept him up so long was relaxing fast. He felt that he must\r\nsleep or die. Yet they talked together a little before they stretched\r\nthemselves upon their blankets.\r\n\r\n“Do you think Bragg will attack us in Chattanooga, Dick?” asked\r\nPennington.\r\n\r\n“I don't. Our position here is too strong, and, as he was the assailant,\r\nhis losses must be something awful. Moreover, the rivers are always ours\r\nand reinforcements will soon pour in to us. I think that General Thomas\r\nsaved the Union. What have you to say, George?”\r\n\r\n“Just about what you are saying, Dick. We've been beaten, but not enough\r\nto suit the Johnnies. They have on their side present victory. We have\r\non ours present but not total defeat. You might say they have x, while\r\nwe have x + y. Wait until I look into my algebra, and I can find further\r\nmathematical and beautiful propositions proving my contention beyond the\r\nshadow of a doubt.”\r\n\r\nHe took out his algebra and opened it. A bullet fell from the leaves\r\ninto his lap. Warner picked it up and examined it carefully. Then he\r\nlooked at the book.\r\n\r\n“It went half way through,” he said in tones of genuine solemnity. “If\r\nit had gone all the way it would have pierced my heart and I could never\r\nhave known how this war is going to end. It has saved my life, and I\r\nshall always keep it over my heart until we go back home.”\r\n\r\nDick was asleep the next minute, and they did not wake him for twelve\r\nhours. When he came from the tent he stood blinking in the sun, and a\r\ntall lean youth hailed him with a joyous shout:\r\n\r\n“Why, it's Mason--Mason of Kentucky!” exclaimed the lad, extending a\r\nhardened hand. “I'm glad you're alive. How are those friends of yours,\r\nWarner and Pennington?”\r\n\r\n“Well, save for scratches, Ohio. They're about somewhere.”\r\n\r\nThey shook hands again, hunted up the others, and celebrated their\r\nescape from death.\r\n\r\nDick learned later that all the Woodvilles were still alive and that\r\nColonel Kenton, although wounded, was recovering fast. Slade, with\r\ntroublesome raids, soon gave evidence of his own continued existence.\r\n\r\nThen, as they expected, reinforcements poured in. Grant came, and Dick\r\nand his comrades took part in the fight at Missionary Ridge and the\r\nbattle “above the clouds” on Lookout Mountain. He witnessed great\r\ntriumphs and he had a share in them.\r\n\r\nHe saw Bragg's army broken up, and he rejoiced with the others when the\r\nnews came that Grant for his brilliant successes had been made commander\r\nof all the armies of the Union, and would go east to match himself\r\nagainst the mighty Lee. The Winchester regiment would go with him\r\nand Dick, Warner, Pennington and Sergeant Whitley, who was entirely\r\nrecovered, talked of it gravely:\r\n\r\n“We've been in the East before,” said Pennington, “but we won't be under\r\nany doubting general now.”\r\n\r\n“I fancy it will be the death grapple,” said Warner.\r\n\r\n“And the continent will shake with it,” said Dick.\r\n\r\nThe three, as if by the same impulse, turned and faced the distant East,\r\nwhere the shades were already gathering over the Wilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix: Transcription notes:\r\n\r\nThis etext was transcribed from a volume of the 14th printing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following modifications were applied while transcribing the printed\r\nbook to etext:\r\n\r\n Chapter 1\r\n   Page 30, para 1, add missing close-quotes\r\n\r\n Chapter 2\r\n   Page 39, para 1, add missing close-quotes\r\n   Page 48, para 4, change “its” to “it's”\r\n\r\n Chapter 3\r\n   Page 72, para 1, add missing close-quotes\r\n\r\n Chapter 8\r\n   Page 174, para 2, add a badly-needed comma\r\n   Page 182, para 3, change “replied Pennington” to “replied Warner”\r\n    Page 185, para 5, add missing close-quotes\r\n\r\n Chapter 10\r\n   Page 216, para 2, move a badly-misplaced comma\r\n   Page 217, para 5, add a badly-needed comma\r\n\r\n Chapter 12\r\n   Page 258, para 2, add missing open-quotes\r\n\r\n Chapter 14\r\n   Page 297, para 1, fixed typo “Mississipians”\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 15\r\n   Page 320, para 2, remove an extra comma\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Limitations imposed by converting to plain ASCII:\r\n\r\n  - The word “cooperated” in chapter 8 was presented in the printed\r\n    book with an accented “o”\r\n   - In chapter 11, “Caesar” was presented with the “ae” ligature\r\n  - In chapter 11, the ship's name “Union” was presented in italics\r\n  - In chapter 14, “Thermopylae” was presented with the “ae” ligature\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Rock of Chickamauga, by Joseph A.
