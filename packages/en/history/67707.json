The greatest writers of antiquity[2] were on this\r\nsubject perplexed and undecided. They appear to have comprehended the\r\nfull extent of the evil,[3] but to have been too much the slaves\r\nthemselves of habit and prejudice to discover, that no form or\r\nmodification of servitude is consistent with human happiness or with\r\njustice, without which no happiness can be. This is evident from the\r\nconversation in Crete between Plato and his Gnosian and Spartan\r\ncompanions. They do not trouble their minds with inquiries respecting\r\nthe origin of slavery, which, while some tribes of men are stronger and\r\nmore civilised than others, could never be difficult to be conjectured;\r\nbut considering its existence easy to be accounted for, they are\r\nconcerned to discover by what means may be avoided or mitigated the\r\nmischiefs they everywhere saw accompanying it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  On the state of domesticity in modern times, see the interesting work\r\n  by Monsieur Grégoire, Sur la Domesticité, p. 3, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plat. de Legg. t. viii. p. 38.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Thus Metrodoros:—Δοῦλος ἀναγκαῖον μὲν κτῆμα, οὐχ ἡδὺ δὲ. Stob.\r\n  Florileg. Tit. 62. 44.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMost perplexing of all,[4] however, was the Laconian Heloteia; because\r\nin that case the comparatively great number of the servile caste\r\nrendered it necessary, in the opinion of some, to break their spirit and\r\nbring them down to their condition by a system of severity which\r\nconstitutes the infamy of Sparta.\r\n\r\nThe discredit, however, of subsisting on slave labour was to a certain\r\nextent shared by all the states of Greece, even by Athens. They appear\r\nto have supposed that no slaves, no body politic.[5] But in the\r\ntreatment of those unfortunate men there was as much variation as from\r\nthe differences of national character might have been inferred. The\r\nAthenians in this respect, as in most others, being the antipodes of the\r\nSpartans, and falling into the error, if such a thing can be conceived,\r\nof extreme humanity and indulgence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plat. de Legg. vi. t. vii. p. 460.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Even no house according to Aristot. Polit. i. 3. Stob. Floril. Tit.\r\n  62. 44.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt possible by kindness to obliterate many of the ugly\r\nfeatures of slavery, so that between the vassal and his lord strong\r\nmutual affection may spring up.[6] We hear, accordingly, of slaves whose\r\nlove for their masters exceeded the love of brothers, or of children;[7]\r\nthey have toiled, fought, died, for them; nay they have sometimes\r\nsurpassed them in courage, and taught them, in situations of imminent\r\ndanger, how to die, as in the case of that military attendant, who, when\r\ntaken prisoner with his master, and seeing him resolved on death, yet\r\nhesitating about the means, dashed his brains out against the wall to\r\nshow him how it might be done. Another example is recorded of a slave\r\nwho put on the disguise of his lord, that he might be slain in his\r\nstead. But what then? Do these examples prove that in servitude there is\r\nanything ennobling? On the contrary, the only inference to be drawn from\r\nthem is, that in these cases great and worthy souls had been dealt with\r\nunjustly by fortune. However, since none but the incorrigibly base can\r\nnow be found to advocate this worst of all human vices, I may spare my\r\narguments, and proceed at once to trace the history of slavery in\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Herodes Atticus, for instance, lamented the death of his slaves as if\r\n  they had been his relations, and erected statues to their memory in\r\n  woods, or fields, and beside fountains. Philost. Vit. Soph. ii. 10.\r\n  Among respectable slaves it was thought disgraceful to drink when the\r\n  family was in trouble. Vict. Var. Lect. viii. 4. A striking example of\r\n  the affection produced by good usage is mentioned by Libanius: “Sed,\r\n  ut intelligas,” says the sophist, writing to Uranius, “quam fidum\r\n  habeas servum, quæsivi ego tunc otiosus, cur, præter ejus generis\r\n  hominum, consuetudinem tanta fide res tuas curaret? Is vero mihi\r\n  graviter sapientissimèque respondit se novum quoddam fidissimæ\r\n  servitutis genus excogitare oportuisse, quoniam herum habeat nomine,\r\n  re vero fratrem, cum quo eundem cibum caperet, idem vinum biberet, à\r\n  quo non modo vapularet, sed ne malum quidem unquam aliquid audiret,”\r\n  Epistol. i. 16. Lat. ed J. C. Wolf. p. 739. a.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Plato, de Legg. vi. t. vii. p. 460.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn very remote ages mankind, according to tradition, dispensed with the\r\nlabours of domestic slaves,[8] whose place was supplied by the women of\r\nthe family,[9] who rose before day to grind corn for the household; and\r\nas they usually sang while thus engaged, the whole village on such\r\noccasions would seem alive with music. As in the East, also, they were\r\naccustomed to draw water from the wells, or seek it at a distance at the\r\nfountains, as I have already, in speaking of the Hellenic women,\r\nobserved. But as soon as men began to give quarter in war, and became\r\npossessed of prisoners, the idea of employing them, and rendering their\r\nlabours subservient to their maintenance naturally suggested itself. At\r\nthe outset, therefore, as a very distinguished historian[10] has\r\nremarked, servitude sprung from feelings of humanity; for when it was\r\nfound that advantages could be derived from captured enemies they were\r\nno longer butchered in the field. Hence, from the verb signifying “to be\r\nsubdued,” they were denominated Dmöes;[11] for “of whom a man is\r\novercome, of the same is he brought in bondage.”[12] Of these constant\r\nmention is made in Homer. Thus Telemachos speaks of the Dmöes whom his\r\nfather had left in his charge; and Agamemnon detained in his tent a\r\nnumber of Lesbian women taken captive in war. In the same condition was\r\nBriseïs: and to this fate Hector fears Andromache may be reserved after\r\nhis death.[13]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  In old times there were neither Manes nor Sekis: the women did\r\n  everything. Athen. vi. 83. Cf. Herod. vi. 137. Of these early periods,\r\n  however, few records remain, for as soon as the Greeks appear upon the\r\n  stage of history they are attended by slaves. On this account Philo\r\n  Judæus admires the Argonauts, who on their celebrated expedition\r\n  forewent the aid of servile labour: ἄγαμαι καὶ τῶν Ἀργοναυτῶν, οἰ\r\n  σύμπαν ἀπέφῃναν ἐλεύθερον τὸ πλήρομα, μηδένα μήτε τᾶς εἰς ἀναγκαίας\r\n  ὑπηρεσίας προσέμενοι δοῦλον, ἀδελφὸν ἐλευθερίας αὐτουργίαν ἐν τῷ τότε\r\n  ἀσπασαμένων Lib. quisq. virt. Stud. t. ii. p. 467. ed. Mangey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  In later times, however, this laborious task devolved upon female\r\n  slaves. “Gottlieb Fischer (Disput. Philolog. de Molis Manual. Vet. in\r\n  4. Gedani, 1728,) établit, par des preuves multipliées, que chez les\r\n  Egyptiens, les Babyloniens, les Perses, les Arabes, les Grecs, les\r\n  Romains, ce travail étoit ordinairement le partage des femmes\r\n  esclaves. L’invention des moulins à eau fut pour elles l’époque d’une\r\n  joie universelle, dont le poète Antipater se rendit l’interprète par\r\n  une pièce arrivée jusqu’à nous: Femmes occupées a moudre, ne fatiguez\r\n  plus vos bras, dormez la longue matinée ... Cérès a ordonné aux\r\n  nymphes de remplacer l’ouvrage de vos mains, etc.” Grégoire de la\r\n  Domesticité, p. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Mitford, Hist, of Greece, i. 405.$1“$2”$3See on this subject, Grotius\r\n  de Jur. Bell. et Pac. iii. 14. Rousseau’s Contrat Social, i. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Δμῶες dicti παρὰ δαμᾶσθαι, à domando, Feith. Antiq. Hom. ii. 20. p.\r\n  180. Horn.

Æneid.\r\n  iii. 326, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPossibly the practice was borrowed from the East, where the mention of\r\nslaves occurs in the remotest ages. Thus too in later times, Atossa,\r\nqueen of Persia, is represented to have urged Darius into the Grecian\r\nwar, that she might possess Athenian, Spartan, Argive, and Corinthian\r\nslaves.[14] And the Pythoness foretelling the destruction of Miletus,\r\nexclaims:\r\n\r\n  “And of a numerous long-haired race thy wives shall wash the\r\n  feet.”[15]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Herod, iii. 134. Ἐπιθυμέω observes the queen, γὰρ λόγῳ πυνθανομένη,\r\n  Λακαίνας τέ μοι γενέσθαι θεράπαινας καὶ Ἀργείας καὶ Ἀττικὰς καὶ\r\n  Κορινθίας. The same thing is related by Ælian (De Nat. Animal, xi.\r\n  27); but it is probable that Herodotus was the authority on which he\r\n  based his narrative.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Herod, vi. 19.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe practice was when a number of prisoners had been taken, to make a\r\ndivision of them among the chiefs, generally by lot, and then to sell\r\nthem for slaves.[16] This Achilles boasts he had frequently done, and\r\nold Priam fears will be the destiny of his own sons, as it had been of\r\nLycaon whom the Thessalian hero had seized[17] in his garden. To the\r\nsame purpose is the lament of Hecuba,[18] who accuses him of having\r\nreduced many of her sons to slavery. Examples occur in antiquity of\r\nwhole cities and states being at once subjected to servitude: thus the\r\ninhabitants of Judea were a first and a second time carried away captive\r\nto Babylon, where their masters, not perhaps from mockery, required of\r\nthem to sing for their entertainment some of their national songs, to\r\nwhich, as we learn from the prophet, they replied: “How can we sing the\r\nsongs of Zion in a strange land?” The citizens likewise of Miletos,\r\nafter the unsuccessful revolt of Aristagoras, were transported into\r\nPersia, as were those also of Eretria and Carystos in Eubœa.[19] Like\r\nthe Israelites, these Greeks long preserved in captivity their national\r\nmanners and language, though surrounded by strangers and urged by every\r\ninducement to assimilate themselves to their conquerors. A similar fate\r\novertook the inhabitants of Thebes, who were sold into slavery by\r\nAlexander, as were those of Mycene by the Argives, and the Corinthians\r\nby Mummius.[20]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Eurip. Troad. 30, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Feith, Antiq. Horn. p. 181.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  Iliad. φ. 102. ω. 751, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Herod, vi. 20, 119.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Diod. Sicul. xi. Arrian, Anab. i. p. 11. Plut. Symp. ix. 1. Mitf.\r\n  Hist. of Greece, ii. 176.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the supply produced by war seldom equalled the demand; and in\r\nconsequence a race of kidnappers sprung up, who, partly merchants and\r\npartly pirates, roamed about the shores of the Mediterranean, as similar\r\nmiscreants do now about the slave-coasts, picking up solitary and\r\nunprotected individuals. Sometimes their boldness rose to the wives or\r\ndaughters of the chiefs; as in the case of Paris, who robbed the house,\r\nand carried away the wife of Menelaus; and of those Phœnicians who\r\nhaving landed at Argos and held, during several days, a fair on the\r\nbeach, ended by stealing the king’s daughter.[21] Mitford’s supposition\r\nthat both Io and her companions may have been allured on board,[22] is\r\nfounded on the apologetical narrative of the pirates themselves. The\r\npractice of kidnapping certainly prevailed widely. Thus Eumæos was, by\r\nthe Phœnicians, sold to Laertes, and a similar fate awaited the woman\r\nwhom the Taphian pirates stole away at the same time.[23] Odysseus\r\nhimself relates how a Phœnician rogue plotted against his liberty when\r\nhe was sailing with him towards Libya, and that the Thesprotians had\r\nmeditated a like design.[24] To enumerate no other instances, Laomedon\r\nmenaces Apollo and Poseidon with servitude, observing that he will have\r\nthem bound and shipped to some distant island for sale.[25]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Herod, i. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  History of Greece, i. 32.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. ο. 427. 482.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. ζ. 340.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Iliad. φ. 453, seq. Feith observes that the Romans afforded no\r\n  encouragement to those low and sordid villains who stole and sold\r\n  their fellow-creatures, and kept none as slaves, but such as were\r\n  lawfully captured in war. Antiq. Hom. ii. 20.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNeither war, however, nor piracy sufficed at length to furnish that vast\r\nmultitude of slaves, which the growing luxury of the times induced the\r\nGreeks to consider necessary. Commerce by degrees conducted them to\r\nCaria and other parts of Asia Minor, particularly the southern coasts of\r\nthe Black Sea, those great nurseries of slaves from that time until\r\nnow.[26] The first Greeks who engaged in this traffic, which even by the\r\nPagans was supposed to be attended by a curse, are said to have been the\r\nChians, and we shall presently see how ill it prospered with them. They\r\npurchased their slaves from the barbarians, among whom the Lydians, the\r\nPhrygians, and the natives of Pontos, with many others were accustomed,\r\nlike the modern Circassians, to carry on a trade in their own\r\npeople.[27] We find mention made in the Anabasis of a Macronian, who\r\nhaving been a slave at Athens and obtaining his liberty, afterwards\r\nbecame a soldier and served the Ten Thousand as an interpreter at a\r\ncritical moment during their passage through his native country.[28]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  Female slaves were obtained from Thrace, Phrygia, and Paphlagonia.\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Acharn. 261. Philost. Vit. Apoll. Tyan. viii. 7. 12.\r\n  Cf. Plut. Sympos. v. 7. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Philost. Vit. Apoll. Tyan. viii. 7. 12. The demoralising effects of\r\n  this traffic were never perhaps better illustrated than by Barbot.\r\n  This writer, while describing the arts by which men entice their own\r\n  children, kindred, or neighbours, to the European factories for the\r\n  purpose of selling them, relates an anecdote exhibiting the ne plus\r\n  ultra of human depravity: “I was told of one who designed to sell his\r\n  own son; but he, understanding French, dissembled for a while, and\r\n  then contrived it so cunningly as to persuade the French that the old\r\n  man was his slave, and not his father, by which means he delivered him\r\n  up into captivity; and thus made good the Italian proverb, a furbo\r\n  furbo e mezzo; amounting to as much as ‘set a thief to catch a thief’\r\n  or ‘diamond cuts diamond.’” Descr. of Guinea, i. 4. The son\r\n  immediately after was relieved of his ill-got gains and himself sold\r\n  for a slave.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. Anab. iv. 8. 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, however, with the history of the slave-trade, it may\r\nbe proper to describe the power possessed by masters over their\r\ndomestics during the heroic ages. Every man appears to have been then a\r\nking in his own house, and to have exercised his authority most regally.\r\nThus we find the young Telemachos taking pleasure in the idea that he\r\nshall be king over his slaves;[29] and Andromache, with a mother’s\r\nfondness, fears lest her son should become the drudge of an unfeeling\r\nlord.[30] Power generally, when unchecked by law, is fierce and inhuman,\r\nand over their household, gentlemen, in those ages, exercised the\r\ngreatest and most awful power, that of life and death, as they\r\nafterwards did at Rome.[31] This is illustrated by an example in the\r\nOdyssey, where the hero being, while in disguise, insulted grossly by\r\nMelanthios, threatens the slave that he will incite Telemachos to cut\r\nhim in pieces. Afterwards, when he has recovered his authority, the\r\nterrible menace is remembered and fulfilled. The culprit is seized and\r\nmutilated with savage barbarity, his members, torn from the body, are\r\nthrown to the dogs, and even the poet, upon the whole so humane, does\r\nnot seem to consider the punishment too great for the offence.[32] It\r\nhas even been supposed that this kind of mutilation was a punishment\r\npeculiar to slaves; for Laomedon, while menacing the gods in the manner\r\nabove described, adds, that he will cut off their ears.[33] When\r\nsupposed to deserve death they were executed ignominiously by hanging,\r\nas in the case of the domestics of Odysseus, whose offences, though\r\ngrave, would scarcely in any free country be visited with capital\r\npunishment.[34] This was regarded as an impure end. To die honourably\r\nwas to perish by the sword.[35]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. α. 397.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Iliad. ω. 734.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  See Joach.

Thus Phœbos\r\nApollo kept the flocks of Admetos, king of Thessaly,[42] and the belief\r\nin this humble condition of the gods on earth is objected by Lucian and\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus,[43] as blameworthy to the Greeks. Herodotus,\r\ntoo, relates that the three sons of Temenos—Gavanes, Aëropos, and\r\nPerdiccas—fled from Argos into Illyria and thence into Upper Macedonia\r\nto the city of Lebæa, where they served the king for hire, the first\r\ntending the royal stud, the second the cattle, and the third the sheep\r\nand goats.[44]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. δ. 644.

Thus the Cretan\r\nking, having made a successful descent on the Attic coast, was\r\npropitiated (as by our own ancestors were the Danes and other Northern\r\nsavages) by an annual offering of fourteen youths and virgins, who,\r\nbeing conveyed to Crete, were there said to be destroyed by a monster\r\nborn of Pasiphaë, daughter of the sun.[45] Theseus, the great hero of\r\nthe Ionic race, delivered his country from this obnoxious tax, and on\r\nhis return to Athens was received by the people with unbounded\r\ngratitude; sacrifices and processions were instituted in his honour, and\r\nthe memory of his noble achievement was religiously preserved as long as\r\npaganism endured.[46]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Isocrat.

Hist. of Greece, i. 70.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnd in some such ways as the above, slaves, in early times, must have\r\nbeen procured; for, as Timæos of Taormina[47] remarks, the Greeks of\r\nthose ages obtained none in the regular course of traffic. He further\r\nadds, that Aristotle was generally accused of having misunderstood the\r\nusages of the Locrians, among whom, as among the Phocians,[48] it was\r\nnot of old the custom to possess slaves, whether male or female. The\r\npractice, however, prevailed in later times; and the wife of that\r\nPhilomelos who took Delphi is said to have been the first who was\r\nattended by two servile handmaids.[49] But when men commence evil\r\ncourses, they seldom know where to stop. Mnason, a Phocian, and friend\r\nof Aristotle,[50] ambitious of rivalling Nicias, the son of Niceratos,\r\npurchased for his own service a thousand slaves, for which he was\r\naccused by his countrymen of lavishing upon them what would have\r\nsupported an equal number of free persons.[51] In that country,\r\ntherefore, it is clear there existed a class of labourers like the\r\nThetes described by Homer, who were ready to work for hire.[52] In their\r\ndomestic economy the simplicity of their manners enabled the Phocians\r\nand Locrians to dispense with the services of slaves, it being the\r\ncustom among them, as among the rustics of Eubœa, whom we have described\r\nabove, for the younger members of the family to wait on the elder.[53]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Ap.

But the Chians possessed only such\r\nbarbarian slaves as they had purchased with money, in which they more\r\nnearly resembled the slave-holding nations of modern times.[56] Other\r\ncircumstances, likewise, in the history of slavery among the Chians,[57]\r\nstrongly suggest the parallel, and deserve to be studied with more care\r\nthan appears to have been bestowed upon them. We have here, perhaps, the\r\nfirst type of the Maroon wars, though on a smaller scale, and marked by\r\nfewer outbreaks of atrocity. It is not, indeed, stated that the females\r\nwere flogged, though throughout Greece the males were so corrected; but,\r\nwhatever the nature of the severities practised on them may have\r\nbeen,[58] the yoke of bondage was found too galling to be borne,[59] and\r\nwhole gangs took refuge in the mountains. Fortunately for them, the\r\ninterior of the island abounded in fastnesses, and was, in those days,\r\ncovered with forest.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Steph. Byzant. v.

Bekk.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  We may probably, however, form some conjecture respecting the injuries\r\n  they endured from the description of the atrocities practised by the\r\n  Sicilians against their slaves. These unhappy men were compelled, as\r\n  history informs us, to forego even the common reward of labour, and,\r\n  though they toiled incessantly for their owners, to provide for their\r\n  daily subsistence by plunder and murder:—βαρέως δ᾽ αὐτοῖς κατά τε τὰς\r\n  ὑπηρεσίας ἐχρῶντο, καὶ ἐπιμελείας παντελῶς ὀλίγης ἠξίουν ὅσα τε\r\n  ἐντρέφεσθαι καὶ ὅσα ἐνδύσασθαι· ἐξ ὠν οἱ πλείους ἀπὸ λῃστείας τὸ ζῇν\r\n  ἐπορίζοντο, καὶ μεστὰ φόνον ἦν ἅπαντα καθάπερ στρατευμάτων\r\n  διεσπαρμένων τῶν λῃστῶν. Diodor. Sicul. ap. Phot. ubi supra.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  They, as well as the Achæans, had a prison called Zetreion, where\r\n  their slaves worked in chains. Etym. Mag. 411. 33.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, the fugitives, erecting themselves dwellings, or taking\r\npossession of caverns among almost inaccessible cliffs, successfully\r\ndefended themselves, subsisting on the plunder of their former owners.\r\nShortly before the time of the writer, to whom we are indebted for these\r\ndetails, a bondsman, named Drimacos, made his escape from the city and\r\nreached the mountains, where, by valour and conduct, he soon placed\r\nhimself at the head of the servile insurgents over whom he ruled like a\r\nking.[60] The Chians led several expeditions against him in vain. He\r\ndefeated them in the field with great slaughter; but, at length, to\r\nspare the useless effusion of human blood, invited them to a conference,\r\nwherein he observed, that the slaves, being encouraged in their revolt\r\nby an oracle, would never lay down their arms or submit to the drudgery\r\nof servitude. Nevertheless, the war might be terminated. “For, if my\r\nadvice,” said he, “be followed, and we be suffered to enjoy\r\ntranquillity, numerous advantages will thence accrue to the state.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  The history of the servile revolt in Sicily offers numerous points of\r\n  resemblance to that of Chios, though Eunus, the leader of the Sicilian\r\n  slaves, by no means deserves, either for character or abilities, to be\r\n  compared with Drimacos. Eunus was an impostor, who, by visions and\r\n  pretended prophecies, excited the slaves to insurrection. He obtained\r\n  credit for his predictions by concealing a bored walnut-shell, filled\r\n  with some fiery substance, in his mouth, and then breathing forth\r\n  sparks and flames like a chimera. His mind, however, was capable of\r\n  ambition, for, among the other events which he foretold, he was\r\n  careful to introduce the fact, that he was one day, by the decrees of\r\n  heaven, to be a king. Diodor. Sicul. 34. Ap. Phot. Biblioth. Cod. 244.\r\n  p. 384. Bekk. The contrivances by which he supported his pretensions\r\n  to miraculous powers are thus described by Florus, iii. 19: Syrus\r\n  quidam nomine Eunus (magnitudo claudium facit, ut meminerimus)\r\n  fanatico furore simulato, dum Syriæ deæ comas, jactat ad libertatem et\r\n  arma servos, quasi numinum imperio concitavit idquæ ut divinitus fieri\r\n  probaret, in ore abdita nuce quam sulfure, et igne stipaveret, leniter\r\n  inspirans flammam inter verba fundebat.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere being little prospect of a satisfactory settlement of the matter\r\nby arms, the Chians consented to enter into a truce as with a public\r\nenemy. Humbled by their losses and defeats, Drimacos found them\r\nsubmissive to reason. He, therefore, provided himself with weights,\r\nmeasures, and a signet,[61] and exhibiting them to his former masters,\r\nsaid, “When, in future, our necessities require that I should supply\r\nmyself from your stores, it shall always be by these weights and\r\nmeasures, and having possessed myself of the necessary quantity of\r\nprovisions, I shall be careful to leave your warehouses sealed with this\r\nsignet. With respect to such of your slaves as may fly and offer\r\nthemselves to me, I will institute a rigid examination into their story,\r\nand if, upon inquiry, they appear to have had just grounds for\r\ncomplaint, I will protect them—if not, they shall be sent back to their\r\nproprietors.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  In illustration of the ancient practice of sealing storehouses and\r\n  other places where valuable things were kept, we may cite the\r\n  following anecdote from Diogenes Laertius. (iv. 8. 3.) Lacydes, who\r\n  succeeded Arcesilaus as principal professor in the New Academy,\r\n  having, as it would appear, a set of thievish domestics, was in the\r\n  habit of carefully sealing the door of his storeroom; but, in order\r\n  not to run any risk of losing the seal, he used, unobserved, as he\r\n  thought, to slip it into the chamber through an aperture in the door.\r\n  The slaves, however, diligently reconnoitering his movements,\r\n  discovered the old gentleman’s secret, and visiting his stores as\r\n  often as they thought proper, they escaped detection by sealing the\r\n  door again, and placing through the hole the signet where he had left\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo these conditions the magistrates readily acceded, upon which the\r\nslaves who still remained with their masters grew more obedient, and\r\nseldom took to flight, dreading the decision of Drimacos.[62] Over his\r\nown followers he exercised a despotic authority. They, in fact, stood\r\nfar more in fear of him than when in bondage of their lords, and\r\nperformed his bidding without question or murmur, as soldiers obey their\r\ncommander. For he was severe in the punishment of the unruly, and\r\npermitted no man to plunder or lay waste the country, or commit any act\r\nof injustice,—in short, to do anything without his order. The public\r\nfestivals he was careful to observe, going round and collecting from the\r\nproprietors of the land, who bestowed upon him voluntarily both wine and\r\nthe finest victims; but if, on these occasions, he discovered that a\r\nplot was hatching, or any ambush laid for him, he would take speedy\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  The conduct of Eunus and his followers, when, immediately after their\r\n  revolt, they took possession of the city of Euna, presented the most\r\n  striking contrast with this moderation of the Chian slaves: they\r\n  pillaged the houses, and, without distinction of age or sex,\r\n  slaughtered the inhabitants, plucking the infants from the breasts,\r\n  and dashing them to the ground. Over part of their atrocities the\r\n  historian modestly drops a veil: Εἰς δὲ τὰς γυναῖκας observes he, οὐδ᾽\r\n  ἔστιν εἰπειν (καὶ τότε βλεπόντων τῶν ἀνδρῶν) ὅσα ἐνύβριζόν τε καὶ\r\n  ἐνησέλγαινον, πολλοῦ αὐτοῖς πλήθους τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως δούλων\r\n  προστεθέντος οἱ καὶ κατὰ τῶν κυρίων πρότερον τὰ ἔσχατα ἐνδεικνύμενοι\r\n  οὕτω πρὸς τὸν τῶν ἄλλων φόνον ετρέποντο. Diodor. Sicul. ap. Phot.\r\n  Biblioth. p. 385.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo far the affairs of the Chians and their revolted bondsmen proceeded\r\nsmoothly. But things continued not always on this footing. Observing old\r\nage to be creeping upon Drimacos, and rendered wanton apparently by\r\nprosperity, the government issued a proclamation, offering a great\r\nreward to any one who should capture him, or bring them his head.[63]\r\nThe old general, discerning, perhaps, signals of treachery, or convinced\r\nthat, at last, it must come to that, took aside a young man whom he\r\nloved, and said, “I have ever regarded you with a stronger affection\r\nthan any other man, and to me you have been, instead of a son, a\r\nbrother, and every other tie. But now, the days of my life are at an\r\nend, nor would I have them prolonged. With you, however, it is not so.\r\nYouth and the bloom of youth are yours. What then is to be done? You\r\nmust prove yourself to possess valour and greatness of soul; and since\r\nthe state offers riches and freedom to whomsoever shall slay me and bear\r\nthem my head, let the reward be yours. Strike it off, and be happy!”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  The Romans, it must be owned, conducted the war against Eunus, who had\r\n  adopted the style and title of a king, in a manner more worthy of the\r\n  republic. The number of the insurgents amounted at one time to sixty\r\n  thousand men, who, armed with axes, slings, stakes, and cooking-spits,\r\n  defeated several armies, and carried on hostilities during upwards of\r\n  three years. Pursuing them, however, without relaxation, the state\r\n  prevailed at length, utterly crushed the insurrection, and carried\r\n  Eunus a prisoner to Rome, where, according to Plutarch, he, like the\r\n  dictator, Sylla, was devoured by vermin: Εἰ δὲ δεῖ καὶ των ἀπ´ οὐδενὸς\r\n  μὲν χρηστοῦ γνωρίμων δ´ ἄλλως ἐπιμνησθῆναι, λέγεται τὸν ἄρξαντα τοῦ\r\n  δουλικοῦ πολέμου περὶ Σικελίαν δραπέτην, Εὔνουν ὄνομα μετὰ τὴν ἄλωσιν\r\n  εἰς Ῥώμην ἀγόμενον ὑπὸ φθειριάσεως ἀποθανεῖν. Vit. Syl. § 36. Cf.\r\n  Diod. Sicul. 34. Ap. Phot. Biblioth. 386. The conclusion of the war by\r\n  Perperna is thus related by Florus: Tandem Perperna imperatore\r\n  supplicium de eis sumptum est. Hic enim victos et apud Eunam novissimè\r\n  obsessos quum fame quasi pestilentia consumpsisset reliquias latronum\r\n  compedibus catenis religavit, crucibusque punivit fuitque de servis\r\n  ovatione contentus, ne dignitatem triumphi servili inscriptione\r\n  violaret. iii. 19.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAt first the youth rejected the proposal, but ultimately Drimacos\r\nprevailed. The old man fell, and his friend on presenting his head\r\nreceived the sum which had been offered by the state, together with his\r\nfreedom, and thereupon after burying his benefactor’s remains, he sailed\r\naway to his own country. Now, however, the Chians underwent the just\r\npunishment of their treachery. No longer guided by the wisdom and\r\nauthority of Drimacos, the fugitive slaves returned to their original\r\nhabits of plunder and devastation; whereupon, remembering the moderation\r\nof the dead, they erected an Heroön upon his grave, and denominated him\r\nthe propitious hero. The insurgents, too, holding his memory in no less\r\nveneration, continued for ages to offer up the first-fruits of their\r\nspoil at his tomb. He was, in fact, honoured with a kind of apotheosis,\r\nand canonized among the gods of the island; for it was believed that his\r\nshade often appeared to men in dreams for the purpose of revealing some\r\nservile conspiracy while yet in the bud: and they to whom he vouchsafed\r\nthese warning visits, more grateful than when he yet lived, never failed\r\nto proceed to his chapel, and offer sacrifice to his manes.[64]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Nymphiodor. ap. Athen. vi. 88, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn another department of iniquity the Chians would appear to have been\r\nengaged about the period of Xerxes’ expedition into Greece; I mean the\r\nmaking of eunuchs for the Eastern market. Panionios, a miscreant engaged\r\nin this traffic, who had mutilated and sold into slavery a young man\r\nnamed Hermotimos, at length expiated his offence against human nature by\r\nbeing himself, together with his four sons, subjected to the same\r\noperation.[65] His countrymen, also, in process of time, were, in like\r\nmanner, compelled to drain the bitter cup of servitude. For, as we find\r\nrecorded by Nicolaos the Peripatetic, and Posidonios the Stoic, having\r\nbeen subjugated by Mithridates of Cappadocia, they were delivered up to\r\ntheir own slaves to be carried away captive into Colchis, which\r\nAthenæus, a man not overburdened with religion, considers the just\r\npunishment of their wickedness in having been the first who introduced\r\nthe slave-trade into Greece, when they might have been better served by\r\nfreemen for hire. From this ancient villany of the Chians is supposed to\r\nhave arisen the proverb—“the Chian has bought himself a master,” which\r\nEupolis introduced into his drama called the “Friends.”[66]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  Herod. viii. 105.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 91.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe servile war which took place among the Samians, had a more fortunate\r\nissue, though but few particulars respecting it have come down to us. It\r\nwas related, however, by Malacos, in his annals of the Siphnians, that\r\nEphesos was first founded by a number of Samian slaves, who having\r\nretired to a mountain on the island to the number of a thousand,\r\ninflicted numerous evils on their former tyrants. These in the sixth\r\nyear of the war, having consulted the oracle, came to an understanding\r\nwith their slaves, who being permitted to depart in safety from the\r\nisland, sailed away, and became the founders of the city and people of\r\nEphesos.[67]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 92.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn Attica, the institution of slavery,[68] though attended, as it\r\neverywhere must be, by innumerable evils, nevertheless exhibited itself\r\nunder the mildest form which it anywhere assumed in the ancient\r\nworld.[69] With their characteristic attention to the interests of\r\nhumanity, the Athenians enacted a law, in virtue of which slaves could\r\nindict their masters for assault and battery. Hyperides, accordingly,\r\nobserved in his oration against Mantitheos, “our laws making no\r\ndistinction in this respect between freemen and slaves, grant to all\r\nalike the privilege of bringing an action against those who insult or\r\ninjure them.”[70] To the same effect spoke Lycurgus[71] in his first\r\noration against Lycophron; but Demosthenes has preserved the law which\r\nempowered any Athenian, not labouring under legal disability, to\r\ndenounce to the Thesmothetæ the person who offered violence to man,\r\nwoman, or boy, whether slave or free. The action was tried before the\r\ncourt of Heliæa, and numerous were the examples of men who had suffered\r\ndeath for crimes committed against bondsmen. Not, therefore, without\r\nreason did the orator eulogise the humane spirit of the law, or dwell\r\nupon the beneficial effects which a knowledge of its existence must\r\nproduce among those barbarous nations who furnished Greece with servile\r\nlabourers.[72] Another privilege enjoyed by the slave class in Attica\r\nwas that of purchasing their own freedom, as often as, by the careful\r\nmanagement of the peculium secured them by law, they were enabled to\r\noffer to their owners an equivalent for their services.[73]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  For the condition of the public slaves δημόσιοι see the notes on\r\n  Demosth.

Att. ii. 6, p. 179.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nStill, even in Attica, the yoke of bondage was a heavy yoke, the law\r\nitself, in other matters, drawing distinctions between freemen and\r\nslaves doubly galling because palpably unnecessary. Legally, for\r\nexample, they were not allowed to wear long hair,[74] or a garment with\r\ntwo sleeves,[75] to drink wine, save at the festival of Pithœgia on the\r\nfirst day of the month Anthesterion; to anoint themselves as in the\r\ngymnasia, to be present at the procession in honour of the Eumenides, or\r\nin the case of females to enter the temple of Demeter during the\r\ncelebration of the Thesmophoria.[76] A similar spirit pervaded the\r\nservile code in other parts of Greece. Thus, in the island of Cos they\r\nwere prohibited from joining in the sacrifices to Hera, and from tasting\r\nthe victims. They were, likewise, forbidden to be present when offerings\r\nwere presented to the Manes of Phorbas. But from the very words of the\r\nlaw which authorised the temple wardens to exclude them on these\r\noccasions, it is clear that on all others they might freely enter.[77]\r\nAt Athens, with the exceptions above mentioned, every temple in the city\r\nappears to have been open to them. Occasionally, moreover, certain of\r\ntheir number were selected to accompany their masters to consult the\r\noracle at Delphi, when even they were permitted, like free citizens, to\r\nwear crowns upon their heads, which, for the time conferred upon them\r\nexemption from blows or stripes.[78] Among their more serious\r\ngrievances, was their liability to personal chastisement, which, besides\r\nbeing inflicted as our punishment of the treadmill, or whipping,[79] at\r\nthe carts’-tail, by an order of the magistrates,[80] was too much left\r\nto the discretion of their owners, whose mercies in many cases would be\r\nnone of the most tender. In time of war, however, this planter’s luxury\r\ncould not be enjoyed,[81] since the flogged slaves might go over to the\r\nenemy, as sometimes happened.[82] They are said, besides, to have worked\r\nthe mines in fetters; probably, however, only in consequence of the\r\nrevolt described by Posidonios, in which they slew the overseers of the\r\nmines, and taking possession of the acropolis of Sunium,[83] laid waste\r\nfor a considerable time the whole of the adjacent districts. This took\r\nplace simultaneously with the second insurrection of the slaves in\r\nSicily (there was, perhaps, an understanding between them) in the\r\nquelling of which nearly a million of their number were destroyed.[84]\r\nOther grievances they endured, which will be noticed as we proceed; but\r\nin addition to those that actually existed, a learned modern writer has\r\nimagined another, which, in his opinion, reduces their condition beneath\r\nthat of the Helots. “Nearly all the ties of family were broken,” he\r\nsays, “among the slaves of Athens;” and further explaining himself in a\r\nnote remarks, that the marriage of slaves was there an uncommon\r\nevent.[85] We find, however, from contemporary writers, that except in\r\ncases of incorrigible perverseness, slaves were, on the contrary,\r\nencouraged to marry, it being supposed they would thus become more\r\nattached to their masters.[86] The same bold and ingenious writer\r\nendeavours to give a reason for what has been quoted above, by saying,\r\n“it was cheaper to purchase than to bring up slaves.” This was not the\r\nopinion of the ancients, “we,” say they, “prefer and put more trust in\r\nslaves born and brought up in the house, than in such as are\r\npurchased.”[87]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

But the right of\r\nsanctuary was no doubt limited, and only extended from the time of the\r\nslave’s flight to the next New Moon, when a periodical slave-auction\r\nappears to have been held.[92]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

Nay it is even said that\r\nNicias, son of Niceratos, bought an overseer for his silver mines at the\r\nprice of a talent, or two hundred and forty-one pounds sterling.[97]\r\nThis passage is in substance quoted by Boeckh,[98] who observes that,\r\nexclusively of the fluctuations caused by the variations in the supply\r\nand the demand, the market-price of slaves was affected by their age,\r\nhealth, strength, beauty, natural abilities, mechanical ingenuity, and\r\nmoral qualities. The meanest and cheapest class were those who worked in\r\nthe mills,[99] where mere bodily strength was required, and therefore by\r\nsetting Samson at this labour the Philistines intimated their extreme\r\ncontempt for his blind energy. A very low value was set upon such slaves\r\nas worked in the mines, about 150 drachmas in the age of\r\nDemosthenes.[100] Ordinary house-slaves, whether male or female, might\r\nbe valued at about the same price. Demosthenes, in fact, considered two\r\nminæ and a half a large sum for a person of this class. Of the\r\nsword-cutlers possessed by the orator’s father some were valued at six\r\nminæ, others at five, while the lowest were worth above three.\r\nChair-makers sold for about two minæ.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Anach. v. 35.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn his discussion on this point, Boeckh[101] charges Demosthenes with\r\nintentional falsehood, because, in his oration against Aphobos, he\r\nreckons fourteen sword-cutlers at forty minæ, something less than three\r\nminæ a-piece. But among those possessed by his father at his death some\r\nwere reckoned at only three minæ. His guardians made use of them for ten\r\nyears, that is, till they were grown old, by which time the best would\r\nhave deteriorated, and the others become of no value.[102] This being\r\nthe case, I do not see upon what ground Boeckh bases his accusation. The\r\nwages of slaves, when let out by their masters on hire, varied greatly,\r\nas did also the profit derived from them. A miner was supposed to yield\r\nhis master an obolos per day, a leather-worker two oboli, and a foreman\r\nor overseer three. Expert manufacturers of fine goods, such as\r\nhead-nets, stuffs of Amorgos, and variegated fabrics like our flowered\r\nmuslins, must have produced their owners much greater returns.[103]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  Pub.

Most of the temples of\r\nGreece possessed, in fact, a great number of slaves or serfs, who\r\ncultivated the sacred domains, exercised various humbler offices of\r\nreligion, and were, in short, ready on all occasions to execute the\r\norders of the priests.[105] At Corinth, where the worship of Aphrodite\r\nchiefly prevailed, these slaves consisted almost exclusively of\r\nwomen,[106] who having, on certain occasions, burnt frankincense, and\r\noffered up public prayers to the goddess, were sumptuously feasted\r\nwithin the precincts of her fane.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  Rudig. ad Dem.

In cases of difficulty, moreover, these unfortunate\r\nindividuals were subjected to torture, in order to obtain that kind of\r\nevidence which the ancients deemed most satisfactory.[108]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  Vid.

The name\r\ngiven to the female slave in the same condition was σηκὶς, or\r\nοἰκογενὴς.[113] The housekeeper, likewise a slave, received the\r\nappellation of ταμεία[114] from her office. A lady’s maid they called\r\nπαιδίσκη,[115] though it be doubtful, according to Pollux, whether the\r\norator Lysias, who uses the word, does so with reference to the girl’s\r\nyouth or condition.[116] A slave born of slaves in the house is called\r\nοἰκοτριβαίος.[117] Chrysippos makes a distinction between οἰκέτης[118]\r\nand δοῦλος,[119] but without much foundation. Clitarchus enumerates\r\nvarious names by which slaves were known in Greece: ἄζοι,\r\nθεραπόντες,[120] ἀκόλουθοι,[121] πάλμονες, and λάτρεις. Rural slaves\r\nwere called ἐρκίται. Hermon, in his Cretan Glossaries, observes, that\r\nslaves, born of free parents (εὐγένεις), were, in the island of Crete,\r\ncalled μνῶται. Seleucus informs us, that ἄζοι signifies servants male\r\nand female.[122] The latter were also denominated ἀποφράσαι and βολίζαι.\r\nA male slave, born of a slave, was termed σινδρὼν; a female attendant on\r\na lady, ἀμφίπολος; a slave-girl who walked before her mistress,\r\nπρόπολος. Female slaves were, at Lacedæmon, called χαλκίδες. The term\r\nοἰκέτης was applied to any person employed about a house, whether slave\r\nor free.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  Etym.

They placed him before the\r\nhearth, where his future master, mistress, and fellow-servants, poured\r\nbaskets of ripe fruit, dates, figs, filberts, walnuts, and so on, upon\r\nhis head, to intimate that he was come into the abode of plenty.[123]\r\nThe occasion was converted by his fellow-slaves into a holiday and a\r\nfeast; for custom appropriated to them whatever was thus cast upon the\r\nnew-comer, and as there were sweetmeats among the rest, they had\r\nwherewith to make merry.[124]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  Sch. Aristoph. Plut. 768, with the commentators. Pollux, iii. 77.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Vales. ad Harpocrat. p. 298.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTheir food was commonly, as might be expected, inferior to that of their\r\nmasters. Thus the dates grown in Greece, which ripened but imperfectly,\r\nwere appropriated to their use; and for their drink they had a small\r\nthin wine called Lora,[125] by the Romans made of the husks of grapes,\r\nlaid, after they had been pressed, to soak in water,[126] and then\r\nsqueezed again, like our _Bunnel_, in the perry country.[127] That they\r\ngenerally ate barley-bread in Attica was no peculiar hardship,[128]\r\nsince the citizens themselves frequently did the same. We find,\r\nmoreover, that to give a relish to their coarse meal, plain broth, and\r\nsalt fish,[129] they were indulged with pickled gherkins. In the early\r\nages of the commonwealth they imitated the frugal manner of their lords,\r\nso that no slave who valued his reputation would be seen to enter a\r\ntavern; but in later times they naturally shared largely in the general\r\ndepravity of morals, and placed their summum bonum in eating and\r\ndrinking. Their whole creed, on this point, has been summed up in a few\r\nwords by the poet Sotion.[130] “Wherefore,” exclaims a slave, “dole\r\nforth these absurdities, these ravings of sophists, prating up and down\r\nthe Lyceum, the Academy, and the gates of the Odeion? In all these there\r\nis nothing of value. Let us drink, let us drink deeply, O Sicon,\r\nSicon![131] Let us rejoice, whilst it is yet permitted us to delight our\r\nsouls. Enjoy thyself, O Manes! Nothing is sweeter than the belly, which\r\nalone is to thee as thy father and thy mother. Virtues, embassies,\r\ngeneralships, are vain pomps, resembling the plaudits of a dream.\r\nHeaven, at the fated hour, will deliver thee to the cold grasp of death,\r\nand thou wilt bear with thee nothing but what thou hast drunk and eaten!\r\nAll else is dust, like Pericles, Codros, and Cimon.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  Varro, De Re Rust. i. 54.

Athen. i. 61.\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  Nevertheless, Trygæos considers it a misfortune to be confined to this\r\n  kind of food, since he wishes that the armourers, who desire that\r\n  their trade may flourish, might fall into the hands of robbers, and be\r\n  dieted on barley-bread:—ληφθεὶς ὑπὸ ληστῶν ἐθίοι κριθὰς μόνας.

But this was to wish them long\r\n  life and sharp senses, since the longevity and keen sight of the\r\n  Chaldæans, which enabled them, I suppose, to look into futurity, are\r\n  chiefly attributed to their bannocks of barley-meal.

Δοῦλος ὢν φοβεῖ τὸν Ἄιδην\r\n                       ὅς σ’ ἀπαλλάξ εκ κακῶν.\r\n                    Phryx. Πᾶρ’ ἀνὴρ κἂν δοῦλος\r\n                       ἦι τις ἥδεται τὸ φῶς ὁρῶν.\r\n                                     Orest. 1537, sqq.\r\n\r\n  The observation of the Phrygian is just; for God, who tempers the wind\r\n  to the shorn lamb, mitigates also the misery of the slave, and enables\r\n  him to look upon the light with something like joy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe employment of household slaves necessarily varied according to the\r\nrank and condition of their lords. In the dwellings of the wealthy and\r\nluxurious they were accustomed to fan their masters and mistresses, and\r\nto drive away the flies with branches of myrtle, instead of which, in\r\nthe East, they make use of flappers of palm-leaves. Among the Roman\r\nladies it was customary to retain a female attendant for the sole\r\npurpose of looking after the Melitensian lap-dogs[132] of their\r\nmistresses, in which they were less ambitious than that dame in Lucian,\r\nwho kept a philosopher for this purpose.[133] Female cup-bearers filled\r\nthe place of our saucy footmen.[134] Ladies’ maids were likewise slaves.\r\nThey were initiated in all the arts of the toilette; and it is told of\r\nJulia, whose hair turned prematurely grey, that her ornatrix was\r\nsometimes surprised plucking out the white hairs by the entrance of her\r\nfather.[135] The offices of these ornamenters is thus described by\r\nManilius:\r\n\r\n           Illis cura sui vultus frontisque decoræ\r\n           Semper erit, tortosque in plexum ponere crineis,\r\n           Aut nodis revocare, et rursus vertice denso\r\n           Fingere et appositis caput emutare capillis.[136]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  Pignor. De Serv. p. 190. In illustration of the fondness of certain\r\n  persons for animals, it is related, that there was an old lady in\r\n  Egypt who habitually slept with a crocodile. Plut. Solert.

Scalig.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn these arts they were regularly taught under masters, and there would\r\nlikewise appear to have been a set of men who earned their subsistence\r\nby initiating slaves in household labours. An example is mentioned at\r\nSyracuse of a person[137] who probably had an establishment of his own,\r\nwhere he instructed slaves in the whole round of their domestic duties,\r\nsuch as bread-making, cooking, washing, and so on. In the baker’s\r\nbusiness Anaxarchos, an Eudaimonist philosopher, one of the fitting\r\ncompanions of Alexander the Great,[138] introduced an improvement by\r\nwhich modern times may profit,—to preserve his bread pure from the\r\ntouch, and even from the breath of the slaves who made it, he caused\r\nthem to knead the dough with gloves on their hands, and to wear a\r\nrespirator of some gauze-like substance over the mouth.[139] Other\r\nindividuals, who grudged their domestics a taste of their delicacies,\r\nobliged them, while employed at the kneading-trough, to wear a broad\r\ncollar, like a wheel, which prevented them from bringing their hands to\r\ntheir mouths.[140] This odious practice, however, could not have been\r\ngeneral, as it is clear, from an expression in Aristophanes[141] and his\r\nscholiast, that slaves employed in making bread used to amuse themselves\r\nby eating the dough. This seems to be one of the principal causes of\r\ndisgust to the rogues in the piece employed in preparing the delicacies\r\nwith which Trygæos feeds the beetle whereon he is about to mount to the\r\ncourt of Zeus.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  Arist.

Explic. p. 522,) comme on\r\n  met aux chiens, des colliers ou cercles de fer, sur lesquels étoient\r\n  gravés les noms, profession et demeure du propriétaire, avec\r\n  invitation de les ramener à leurs maîtres en cas de fuite.

Cependant, la coutume de\r\n  museler les esclaves, de leur cadenasser la bouche afin qu’ils ne\r\n  puissent se désaltérer en suçant une canne à sucre, n’est qu’une\r\n  imitation de l’antiquité, car Suidas et Pollux nous apprennent qu’on\r\n  leur mettoit au cou une machine, nommé _pausicape_, en forme de roue,\r\n  qui les empêchoit de porter la main à la bouche et de manger de la\r\n  farine lorsqu’on les occupoit à tourner la meule.” De la Domesticité\r\n  chez les Peuples Anciens et Modernes, p. 6.

A _bon mot_ worth\r\nrepeating is ascribed to this travelling wit. Being one day in the\r\ncemetery of Teicheios, a town of the Milesian territory,[143] inhabited\r\nby a mixed population from all the neighbouring countries, and seeing on\r\nevery tomb the name of some foreigner, “Come,” said he to his slave,\r\n“let us depart from this place. Nobody dies here but strangers.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  Athen. viii. 41.\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  Athen. viii. 43.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOne of the most steady and faithful of the domestics was usually\r\nselected to be the porter.[144] Occasionally, moreover, in the\r\nestablishments of opulent and ostentatious persons, as Callias\r\nfor example, eunuchs, imported from Asia, were employed as\r\ndoor-keepers.[145]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  Mention is also made of female porters. Dem. in Ev. et Mnes. § 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  The scene in which Callias’s eunuch-porter is introduced to us is\r\n  painted in Plato’s liveliest manner. This ancient Bababalouk exhibits\r\n  all the crabbedness of the keeper of an oriental harem; and as we\r\n  listen to him bawling at Socrates through the door, we appear to be\r\n  transported to the establishment of the Emir Fakreddin. Δοκεῖ οὖν μοι,\r\n  ὁ θυρωρός, εὐνοῦχός τις, κατήκουεν ἡμῶν· κινδυνεύει δὲ διὰ τὸ πλῆθος\r\n  τῶν σοφιστῶν ἄχθεσθαι γοῦν ἐκρούσαμεν τὴν θύραν, ἀνοίξας καὶ ἰδων\r\n  ἡμᾶς, Ἔα, ἔφη, σοφισταί τινες· οὐ σχολὴ αὐτῷ.

Some of you go immediately to the\r\nfountain for water.”[146]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. υ. 149. Hist. of Greece, i. 186. Cf. Athen. iii. 73.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBesides working at the mill, and fetching water, both somewhat laborious\r\nemployments, we find that female slaves were sometimes engaged in\r\noffices still more unfeminine; that is, in woodcutting upon the\r\nmountains, where the impudent old fellow, in Aristophanes, takes\r\nadvantage of Thratta.[147] Events of this kind, however, could only\r\nhappen among the peasant girls. In the city both mistresses and maids\r\nwere too domestic to meet with adventures in forest or on mountains.\r\nTowards the decline of the commonwealth, it became a mark of wealth and\r\nconsequence to be served by black domestics, both male and female, as\r\nwas also the fashion among the Romans and the Egyptian Greeks. Thus\r\nCleopatra[148] had negro boys for torch-bearers; and the shallow\r\nexclusive, in Cicero,[149] is anxious to make it known that he has an\r\nAfrican valet. Juvenal, in his sarcastic style, alludes to this\r\npractice.[150]\r\n\r\n                               Tibi pocula cursor\r\n               Gætulus dabit aut nigri manus ossea Mauri.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  Acharn. 272. The principle on which names were bestowed upon slaves is\r\n  thus explained by Helladius: οἱ κωμικοὶ τοὺς οἰκέτας τὸ μὲν πλέον ἀπὸ\r\n  τοῦ γένους κάλουν οἷον Σύρον καρίωνα Μίδαν Γέταν καὶ τὰ ὅμοια, ἐκαλουν\r\n  δὲ καὶ τὰ ἐξ ἐπιθέτων, ὡς ἀπὸ τοῦ χρώματος μὲν Πυῤῥιαν καὶ Ξανθίαν ἀπὸ\r\n  τοῦ τρόπου δὲ Παρμένωνα καὶ Πιστὸν καὶ Δρόμωνα. ἐκάλουν δὲ καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς\r\n  ἡμέρας ἐν ᾗ ὠνήσαντο τὸν οἰκέτην, ἐξ οὗ καὶ τοὺς Νουμηνίας ὠνόμαζον.\r\n  Chrestomath. ap.

Char. p. 58, et ad Casaub. loc. p. 329, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTravellers among the higher Alps are almost invariably attended by Swiss\r\nguides who, laden with their employer’s baggage, climb before them up\r\nthe rocks, and are less fatigued at the close of the day’s journey than\r\nthe rich pedestrians who carry nothing beyond their own weight. This is\r\nan exact image of the style of travelling in antiquity. It was then\r\ncommon even for opulent men, to “make their own legs their compasses,”\r\nas Scriblerus phrases it; but, not to load their own delicate shoulders\r\nwith a knapsack, they were attended, like Bacchos in the Frogs, by a\r\nsteady slave, who carried the baggage, mounted on a porter’s knot upon\r\nhis shoulders. To employ more than one valet in this service was\r\nesteemed a mark of luxurious habits; and therefore Æschines reproaches\r\nDemosthenes that, during his embassy, he was attended by two domestics\r\nwith each a carpet-bag.[152] Both by Theophrastus and Xenophon this\r\nattendant is called an _Acoluthos_, or follower, because it was his duty\r\nto walk behind his master; but this name in general signified a youthful\r\nvalet, kept in personal attendance on the great.[153] The simplicity of\r\nrepublican manners at Athens condemned the habit of maintaining many of\r\nthose elegant youths, which, moreover was prohibited by law.[154]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 152:\r\n\r\n  Συνηκολούθουν δ᾽ αὐτῷ ἄνθρωποι δύο στρωματόδεσμα φέροντες, ἐν δὲ τῷ\r\n  ἑτέρῳ τούτων, ὁς αὐτος ἔφη, τάλαντον ἐνῆν ἀργυρίου.

Here we see the reason why Demosthenes inveighed against Meidias\r\n  on account of the number of his followers.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom the severity of manners, however, one evil arose—the single slave\r\nwas sometimes condemned by vanity to carry the burden of two; and as\r\ntheir grumblings were proportioned to their hardship, their case was\r\nsoon taken up by the comic poets, not, I fear, so much for the sake of\r\nhumanity, as because it often furnished them with a good joke or two. By\r\ndegrees, as no writers dwell so constantly on a fruitful topic or so\r\nfrankly imitate each other, it became the fashion of the stage to\r\nintroduce a miserable devil into every comedy, whose misfortunes, like\r\nthose of the clown in our pantomimes, usually kept the theatre in a\r\nroar. The practice, however, had already grown stale in the time of\r\nAristophanes, who both ridiculed and followed it; for while his sneers\r\nat the grumbling valet are repeated usque ad nauseam, much of the humour\r\nand interest of the Frogs arise out of the tricks and adventures of a\r\nmelancholy wag of this description as Casaubon[155] long ago observed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  Ad.

He has since,\r\n  however, fallen a victim to the persevering ardour with which he\r\n  pursued his researches into the topography of that illustrious land;\r\n  and in common, I believe, with every other admirer of the Hellenic\r\n  people and literature I sincerely lament his premature death. My\r\n  regret moreover is heightened by the knowledge that Mr. Muller had\r\n  projected a history of Greece which his profound investigations and\r\n  extensive knowledge of the country would unquestionably have rendered\r\n  highly valuable. His ashes repose among those of the most\r\n  distinguished men of antiquity. He caught his death among the ruins of\r\n  Delphi, and was buried at Athens.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs, however, he has adopted a very peculiar system in the interpretation\r\nof antiquity, which, though plausible and ingenious, seems\r\nill-calculated to lead to truth, I have found it impossible to\r\nparticipate on many important points the views which he maintains, more\r\nespecially on the subject of the Helots. In fact, with all his talents\r\nand sagacity he has chosen rather to become an advocate than an\r\nhistorian, and pushes so far his eagerness to defend his favourite\r\npeople, as not unfrequently to provoke a smile. In his derivation of the\r\nterm Helot, however, he is perhaps correct,[158] it being more probable\r\nthat it should have sprung from an ancient word signifying “The\r\nPrisoners” than from the name of the town. In the absence of all\r\ntestimony we might likewise entertain the conjecture, “that they were an\r\naboriginal race subdued at a very early period, and which immediately\r\npassed over as slaves to the Doric conquerors.” But we have the weighty\r\nauthority of Theopompos to oppose to this inference, and the words of\r\nthis historian[159] attentively considered would lead to the etymology\r\nof the name given by Müller:—“having taken them prisoners,” he says,\r\n“they called them εἵλωτες.” They were, however, Greeks of the Achaian\r\nrace, who fell, together with the land, into the power of the\r\nnew-comers, so that the excuse of only tyrannising over a foreign and\r\nhalf-savage race is wanting to the Spartans, which was the object aimed\r\nat by Mr. Müller’s ingenious conjecture.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  Dorians, t. ii. p. 30.

Several of this learned historian’s notions on the\r\nLacedæmonian serfs appear to be in direct contradiction with those of\r\nthe writers from whom all we know concerning the Helots is obtained. Of\r\nthis he seems to be conscious, and in the following way endeavours to\r\nbring discredit on them; assuming as a settled thing, that the Helots\r\nmust have possessed political rights, he concludes that they “were\r\n_doubtless exactly_ defined by law and custom, though the expressions\r\nmade use of by ancient authors are frequently vague and ambiguous.”[161]\r\nWhether this be the case or not we shall presently see. The remark of\r\nEphoros is, that “they were in a certain point of view public slaves.\r\nTheir possessor could neither liberate them nor sell them beyond the\r\nborders.” On this passage which he quotes,[162] the historian raises a\r\nsuperstructure which it will by no means support. “From this,” he says,\r\n“it is evident, that they were considered as belonging properly to the\r\nstate, which, to a certain degree, permitted them to be possessed, and\r\napportioned them out to individuals, reserving to itself the power of\r\nenfranchising them.”[163]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  Hist. and Antiq. of the Dorians, t. ii. p. 31.\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:\r\n\r\n  Dorians, ii. 31.\r\n\r\nFootnote 162:\r\n\r\n  Or rather makes up from two or three _disjecta membra_ of Ephoros.\r\n  Strab. viii. 5. t. ii. p. 188, seq. Cf. Paus. iii. 20. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:\r\n\r\n  Dorians, t. ii. p. 31. Ubbo Emmius takes the same view of the subject.\r\n  iii. 138.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe contrary I think is the inference. They were the property of\r\nindividuals, but the state reserved to itself the right of enfranchising\r\nthem and preventing their emancipation, lest persons should be found\r\nwho, like Marcus Porcius, Cato,[164] and the Dutch at the Cape, would\r\nsell or give them their liberty when too old to labour. “But to sell\r\nthem out of the country,” says Mr. Müller, “was not in the power even of\r\nthe state.” It is true there was an ancient law prohibiting the\r\nexportation of the Helots,[165] but the same authority which enacted\r\nthat law could have abrogated it. Had Sparta then chosen to convert her\r\nHelots into an article of traffic, who or what was to prevent her? Since\r\nshe arrogated to herself the right of beating, maiming, and putting them\r\nto death,[166] though completely innocent, is it to be supposed that,\r\nhad it suited her policy, she would have hesitated to sell them? And\r\nafter all are we quite certain that these unhappy people were not\r\nfrequently sold into foreign lands? On the contrary, we find, that a\r\nregular trade was carried on in female Helots, who were exported into\r\nall the neighbouring countries for nurses.[167] Thus it appears that the\r\nstate both had and exercised the power to convert its serfs into\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  Καὶ τούτους (sc. δούλους) πρεσβυτέρους γενομένους (observes Plutarch,\r\n  Vit.

Le gouvernement s’est trouvé forcé\r\n  d’y mettre ordre; nul maître à présent ne peut affranchir son esclave\r\n  qu’en déposant à la chambre des orphelins une somme suffisante pour sa\r\n  subsistance.” Voyage dans l’Intérieur de l’Afrique, t. i. p. 112.\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  Ephor. ap.

Ages. § 3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThat the males also were not exported like cattle, than which they were\r\nfar worse treated, was owing simply to the calculation, that it would be\r\nmore profitable to retain them. For, as the Spartans possessed estates,\r\nwhich personally they never cultivated, the Helots, who equally belonged\r\nto them, were stationed throughout the country upon those estates, which\r\nit was their business to till for the owners. To live it was of course\r\nnecessary that they should eat, and therefore a portion of the produce\r\nwas abandoned to them, according to Tyrtæos,[168] the half, a division\r\nwhich must have borne very hard upon them, since their numbers were five\r\ntimes greater than those of the Spartans.[169] However, even in this\r\narrangement, the learned historian discovers something to praise “as\r\nthis quantity had been definitively settled at a very early period (to\r\nraise the amount being forbidden under very heavy imprecations) the\r\nHelots were the persons who profited by a good and lost by a bad\r\nharvest, which must have been to them an encouragement to industry and\r\ngood husbandry; a motive which would have been wanting if the profit and\r\nloss had merely affected the landlords.”[170] But on the _res rusticæ_\r\nthe notions of this writer are somewhat confused. For in another place\r\nhe remarks that, owing to the “usurpations of the successive conquerors\r\nof Peloponnesos, agriculture was kept in a constant state of dependence\r\nand obscurity, so that we seldom hear of the improvement of the country,\r\nwhich is a necessary part of the husbandman’s business.” It therefore\r\ndid _not_ flourish in Laconia. No, says the historian, that is not the\r\nconclusion we must come to, for, notwithstanding that we never hear of\r\nany improvements in it, “agriculture was always followed with great\r\nenergy and success!”[171]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:\r\n\r\n  Franck.

This fact, therefore,\r\nonly proves that no pressure of hardship or ill-usage can entirely\r\ndestroy the elasticity of the spirit; and no doubt, like all slaves, the\r\nHelots sought to soften their miseries by the gratification which a\r\nsense of property procures even in bondage to the sordid mind.[172] “By\r\nmeans of the rich produce of the land, and in part by plunder obtained\r\nin war, they collected a considerable property, to the attainment of\r\nwhich almost every access was closed to the Spartans.”[173] But of what\r\nvalue is property to a man who is himself the property of another?\r\nBesides, the expression of the historian in this place seems calculated\r\nto lead to erroneous conclusions respecting the Spartans, who, so far\r\nfrom being debarred the means of amassing wealth,[174] rose frequently\r\nto extraordinary opulence, insomuch that this self-denying community\r\ncame at length to be the richest in Greece.[175] To assume that the\r\nHelots, like the Thessalian Penestæ,[176] enjoyed means of augmenting\r\ntheir possessions superior to those permitted themselves by their\r\nmasters, is to propagate an error which must vitiate our whole\r\nconception of the Lacedæmonian commonwealth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n  Herod. ix. 80.

Eustath. ad Il. ν. t. ii. p. 933.\r\n  48.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is confessed that very little intercourse between the Spartans and\r\nthe Helots took place, at least in earlier times; for afterwards, when\r\nthe masters themselves quitted the capital, resided on their\r\nestates,[177] and took to husbandry, the link must necessarily have been\r\nmore closely drawn. And this circumstance renders more probable the\r\naccount transmitted to us of Spartan harshness towards them.\r\nIntercommunion would have begotten more humane feelings in the master,\r\nmore attachment in the slave. For like other men the Spartans felt the\r\ninfluence of intimacy, as is proved by their practice of enfranchising\r\nthe companions of their childhood. They paid, therefore, an involuntary\r\ncompliment to their own hearts when they kept the Helots at a distance,\r\nthat they might be able to tyrannise over them. They could not have\r\nresisted the power of close contact, and acted like Messallina, who fled\r\nin tears from the room where a man was pleading for his life, lest she\r\nshould forgive him, whispering as she went to her instrument that the\r\naccused must not be suffered to escape nevertheless.[178] However, a\r\ncertain number of Helots were retained in the city as personal\r\nattendants on the Spartans, and there waited at the public tables, and\r\nwere lent by one person to another,[179] like so many dogs, or oxen;\r\nalthough it seems probable that all the drudgery of the capital was not\r\nperformed by the Helots alone, but that along with them were associated\r\nother classes of domestic slaves,[180] on whose history and condition\r\nantiquity affords us little or no light. But as the Spartans were\r\nconstantly making prisoners in their wars with the neighbouring states,\r\nwhich were occasionally restored at the termination of hostilities, we\r\nappear to be authorized in concluding, that these captives were commonly\r\nreduced to servitude in Laconia, whether employed in household\r\nlabours,[181] or dispersed among the Helots in the field.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph.

Dorians, t. ii. p. 31.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother service the Helots performed for their masters, which\r\nnecessarily produced some degree of intimacy, I mean the military\r\nservice in which they fought and bled by their side.[182] The state was,\r\nno doubt, reluctant to admit them among the Hoplitæ, or heavy-armed,\r\nwhere the discipline was rigorous, and their weapons would have placed\r\nthem on a level with their oppressors. But even this was sometimes\r\nhazarded, as in the reinforcements forwarded to Gyleppus, at\r\nSyracuse,[183] when six hundred Neodomades and picked Helots were\r\ncomplimented with this dangerous distinction. As light troops, however,\r\nthey almost invariably formed the majority of the Lacedæmonian forces.\r\nIn other countries, where the subject races were more humanely treated,\r\nno fear was entertained at entrusting them with arms. Among the\r\nDardanians, for example, where it was not uncommon for a private\r\nindividual to possess a thousand slaves, or more, they in time of peace\r\ncultivated the land, and in war filled the ranks of the army, their\r\nmasters serving as officers.[184]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  On this point the remark of Capperonier is ingenious: “On les voit\r\n  rarement (les Lacédémoniens) se mettre en campagne sans eux; (les\r\n  Hilotes;) la politique l’exigeoit; que n’auroient-ils pas en à\r\n  craindre si, les contenant à peine lorsqu’ils étoient chez eux, ils\r\n  les y eussent laissés seuls en leur absence?” Recherches sur les\r\n  Hilotes, Mem. de l’Acad.

They were sometimes entrusted\r\n  with important commands on foreign stations, which by the free\r\n  confederates of Sparta, however, was regarded as an insult: ἀλλὰ τοὺς\r\n  μὲν εἴλωτας ἁρμοστὰς, observes the Theban ambassador at Athens,\r\n  καθιστάναι ἀξιοῦσι, τῶν δὲ ξυμμάχων ἐλευθέρων ὄντων, ἐπεὶ εὐτύχησαν,\r\n  δεσπόται ἀναπεφῄνασιν. Xenoph. Hellen. iii. 5. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 103.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom this circumstance one of two things must be inferred; either that\r\nthe Dardanians considered them in the light of subjects, as we do the\r\nnatives of India, where large armies are officered by Englishmen, or\r\nthat that people understood better than any other in antiquity the art\r\nof ruling over men.\r\n\r\nPlato, Isocrates, Aristotle, Plutarch, and a number of other writers\r\nagree in convicting the Spartans of great barbarity towards their\r\nbondsmen, differing, however, as to the degree of that barbarity. But\r\ntheir “philanthropic views”[185] are discarded by the historian, who\r\nwith the skill of an able pleader, overlooks these great writers, whom\r\nhe could not treat with so much want of ceremony, to bring forward the\r\npicture of Myron of Priene, whose history he denominates a romance, and\r\nwhose testimony he contumeliously rejects. In order the more completely,\r\nas he thinks, to demolish this humble writer he quotes the following\r\npassage of his work preserved by Athenæus: “The Helots perform for the\r\nSpartans every ignominious service. They are _compelled_ to wear a cap\r\nof dog-skin,[186] to bear a covering of sheep-skin, and are severely\r\nbeaten every year without having committed any fault, in order that they\r\nmay never forget they are slaves. In addition to this, those amongst\r\nthem who, either by their stature or their beauty, raise themselves\r\nabove the condition of a slave are condemned to death, and the masters\r\nwho do not destroy the most manly of them are liable to\r\npunishment.”[187] The accusation here made is a serious one, and the\r\napologist naturally feels his indignation kindle against its author. In\r\nthis state of mind he employs very harsh language, charges Myron with\r\n“ignorance and partiality,” and altogether speaks as if he were in\r\npossession of facts wherewith to demolish the Prenian’s statement. But\r\nhas he any? Not a single one. He misunderstands entirely the gist of\r\nMyron’s words, in the matter of the dog-skin cap, and then, on the\r\nstrength of his own error, presumes to accuse him of misrepresentation.\r\nIt is at the first blush evident that Myron considered the hardship to\r\nconsist, not in the wearing of the cap, but in being compelled to wear\r\nit. Mr. Müller’s examples, consequently, are nothing to the purpose;\r\nthey simply prove that other people had endured similar hardships, (the\r\nmention of Laërtes is superfluous,) nevertheless, without having uttered\r\none syllable to justify his triumph, he proceeds with much\r\nself-satisfaction to remark, that “since Myron _manifestly_\r\nmisrepresents this circumstance, _it is very probable_ that his other\r\nobjections are founded in error.”[188]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 185:\r\n\r\n  Dorians, ii. 38.\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  On this cap see Meursius, Miscell.

It happens, in fact, that they are true to the letter, and what\r\nis more, are by no means the gravest imputation which can be\r\nsubstantiated against the Dorian model-state. We shall proceed, however,\r\nstep by step examining fairly, and in order, the charges and the\r\ndefence. Plutarch,[189] whose testimony, when favourable, is\r\nunhesitatingly accepted, “relates that the Helots were compelled to\r\nintoxicate themselves, and perform indecent dances as a warning to the\r\nSpartan youth.”[190] Shall we credit Plutarch? No we must not; because\r\n“common sense is opposed to so absurd a method of education.” But if\r\neverything in history which we may determine to be opposed to common\r\nsense were on that account to be rejected, we should make sad inroads\r\nupon the domains of antiquity. That which increases the ridicule of the\r\npractice is, that from among those same Helots they selected tutors for\r\ntheir younger children,[191] as well as companions, so that in the very\r\narticle wherein Xenophon[192] discovered the superiority of Lycurgus’s\r\neducational system, it was completely on a level with that of the other\r\nGreeks, habituating the youth to the intimacy and government of\r\nslaves.[193]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  Lycurg. § 28. To this may be added the testimony of Demetrius\r\n  Cydonius: φασὶ καὶ, Λακεδαιμονίους τῇ τῶν Εἱλώτων μέθῃ τοῖς πασὶν\r\n  ὑποδεικνύναι τὸ τῆς νήψεως ἀγαθον. ap. Meurs. Miscell.

Orat. 41. t.\r\n  ii. p. 261. Though it be most true that domestic slaves are generally\r\n  corrupt in manners and ignoble in sentiments, yet we may be sure from\r\n  an attentive observation, of human nature, that, even were it not so,\r\n  their masters would inevitably seek to justify their own cruelty and\r\n  injustice by depreciating the moral character of their dependents.\r\n  Thus the ablest of Spanish writers, actuated less perhaps by theory\r\n  than by instinct, strives to extenuate the conduct of their countrymen\r\n  towards the natives of America by attributing to them the most odious\r\n  and repulsive qualities: “Les Indiens,” observes Ulloa, “sont moins à\r\n  craindre par leur valeur que par leur perfidie, et par la ruse avec\r\n  laquelle ils commettent leur attentats. Victorieux par surprise, ils\r\n  sont cruels à l’excès, ne connaissent aucun sentiment de compassion.\r\n  Leur cruauté est toujours accompagnée de sang froid, leur plaisir est\r\n  le carnage; mais vaincus ce sont les gens le plus lâches les plus\r\n  pusillanimes qu’on puisse voir. Dans le premier cas ils ont un\r\n  souverain plaisir à répandre le sang des malheureux qu’ils surprennent\r\n  au dépourvu, dans le second ils cherchent à se disculper s’humilient\r\n  jusqu’à la dernière bassesse, condamnent euxmêmes leur furie, prient,\r\n  supplient, et se montrent dans toute leur conduite les plus lâches des\r\n  hommes. Ce contraste est celui qui doit résulter de la lâcheté et de\r\n  la perfidie qui font le charactère de ces barbares.” Mémoires\r\n  Philosophiques. Discours. xvii. t. ii. p. 21, et seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf, however, the relation of Plutarch stood alone, its force would be\r\nless, though with no face could we reject it while admitting in other\r\nrespects his favourable testimony. But from many authors, besides him,\r\nit is clear, that to demoralise the Helots was the constant policy of\r\nSparta. Thus when the Thasians brought a number of useless dainties to\r\nAgesilaos and his army: “Give them,” said he, “to those Helots, whom it\r\nis better to corrupt than ourselves.”[194] Consistently with the same\r\nsystem, and the more completely to debase their minds, they were\r\ncommanded to sing obscene songs and perform indecent jigs, while the\r\nPyrrhic dance and every warlike lay was forbidden them. In proof of\r\nthis, it is related, that when the Thebans, under Epaminondas, invaded\r\nLaconia, and made prisoners a number of the Helots, they commanded them\r\nto sing them some of the songs of Sparta, of Spendon, for example, or\r\nAlcman, or Terpander. But the Helots[195] professed their inability,\r\nobserving, that the acquisition of those lays was forbidden them. In\r\nshort, to adopt the words of Theopompos, they were at all times cruelly\r\nand bitterly treated;[196] deluded, sometimes, from the protection of\r\nsanctuary by perjury, and then coolly assassinated in contempt of\r\nreligion and oaths, as in the case of those suppliants who took refuge\r\nin the temple of Poseidon at Tænaros.[197]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n  Theopomp. ap.

The reader will perceive that I am\r\nabout to speak of the Crypteia, not one feature of which, to my mind,\r\nhas been softened or explained away, or rendered doubtful by the\r\ningenious but very useless special pleading of some distinguished\r\nscholars among our contemporaries.[198] Mr. Müller, with much\r\nintrepidity, leads the van of Sparta’s defenders, and, by an artifice\r\nnot unfamiliar to rhetoricians, seeks to beat down the authorities on\r\nwhich belief in the Crypteia rests. He affects to think slightingly of\r\ntheir means of obtaining information, though certainly, in this respect,\r\nat least, the very meanest of them possessed incalculable advantages\r\nover himself. However, of Isocrates he thus unceremoniously disposes:\r\n“Isocrates speaks of this institution in a very confused manner and from\r\nmere report.”[199] On the contrary, this “old man eloquent,” as Milton\r\naffectionately terms him, luminously, (would that Mr. Müller and I\r\npossessed equal art!) and upon the best authorities,[200] sketches the\r\nhistory of the Lacedæmonian government, its injustice, its oppressions;\r\nand concludes by describing the annual massacre of the Helots. It is\r\nworthy of remark, that, with Aristotle,[201] he attributes to the Ephori\r\nthe direction of this servile war, in which the reins of slaughter were\r\nloosed or tightened by their authority.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n  Capperonier, in the last century, entertained something like\r\n  scepticism on the point, though he could not deny that the moral\r\n  temperament of the Spartans rendered the existence of the institution\r\n  probable. “Le défaut de preuves m’empêche, malgré la ferocité connue\r\n  des Lacédémoniens, de rien décider sur l’usage de la Cryptie.” Mem.\r\n  &c. p. 284.\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n  Dorians, ii. 40, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  Οἱ τἀκείνων ἀκριβοῦντες. Panathen. § 73.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  Ap. Plut. Lycurg. § 28.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe relation, however, of Isocrates, who probably descended to\r\nparticulars, appears not to have come down to us entire. Plutarch,\r\nthough he be the panegyrist, rather than the faithful historian, of\r\nSparta, has supplied the deficiency. He does so, indeed, reluctantly;\r\ntrumpets in the narration with epic flourishes, seeking, by all the art\r\nhe is master of, to shield his beloved Lycurgus from the stern but\r\ndeserved rebuke of Plato.[202] Too honest, however, was the old Bœotian\r\nentirely to suppress the truth. So that, at length, after much\r\npreparation, the massacre is described hurriedly, briefly, with vehement\r\nunwillingness, but, for that very reason, with the more terrible effect.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  See the conversation with Megillos in the First Book of the Laws\r\n  throughout.

It was\r\nprobably the institution of the Crypteia (if as Aristotle contends, it\r\nproceeded from Lycurgus) that inspired Plato with such an opinion of the\r\nlegislator and his laws. According to this ordinance the rulers,\r\nselecting from among the youths those most distinguished for ability,\r\nsent them forth armed with daggers and furnished with the necessary\r\nprovisions, to scour the country, separating and concealing themselves\r\nin unfrequented places by day, but issuing out at night and slaughtering\r\nall such of the Helots as they found abroad. Sometimes, indeed, they\r\nfell upon them while engaged in their rural labours in the fields, and\r\nthere cut off the best and bravest of the race.”[203] Plutarch felt that\r\nconnected with this system, as flowing from the same principle of policy\r\nand designed to effect the same purpose, were those extensive massacres\r\nrecorded in history, by one of which more than two thousand of those\r\nunhappy men, having been insidiously deluded into the assertion of\r\nsentiments conformable to the gallant actions they had performed in the\r\nservice of the state,[204] were removed in a day. Lulled by the gift of\r\nfreedom, crowned, smiled upon, they were conducted to the temples, as if\r\nto implicate the very gods in the treachery:—and then suddenly they\r\ndisappeared; nor to this hour has the fate which overtook them been\r\nrevealed.[205] Compared with this the slaughter of the Janisaries\r\nappears less culpable.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Her\r\nrulers discovered one which appears to have satisfied their own\r\nconsciences. Every year, on taking office, the Ephori, formally, in\r\ntheir good city of Sparta, declared war against their unarmed and\r\nunhappy vassals, “that they might be massacred under pretence of\r\nlaw.”[206] Mr. Müller overwhelmed with the weight of these testimonies,\r\ndoes not yet yield up the point: “Were not these Helots, who in many\r\ndistricts lived entirely alone, united by despair for the sake of common\r\nprotection; and did they not every year kindle a most bloody and\r\ndetermined war throughout the whole of Laconia?” The historian is\r\npleasant upon the Helots. Kindle a war! How happens it that the Chinese,\r\nwho, at many periods of their history, have rivalled the Helots in\r\nsuffering, and like them, too, have rebelled occasionally, yet make\r\nannually no “bloody and determined war” against the Mantchoo Tartars?\r\nThe answer is written on every page of the history of the world, and was\r\nput in form by Alexander when he inquired whether one butcher were\r\nafraid of many sheep? Nevertheless, even the spirit of slavery itself\r\ndid sometimes revolt against oppression and cruelty, and kindled such\r\n“bloody and determined wars” as Sparta, without foreign aid, was unable\r\nto terminate. They were, in fact, during many years, prevented from\r\ndisputing with the Athenians the supremacy in Greece, by contests with\r\ntheir own vassals.[207] And on the occasion of the great earthquake when\r\nnearly every house in Sparta was shaken to the ground,[208] did not the\r\nHelots rejoice at the calamity, and come flocking to the environs of the\r\ncity from the whole country round, in order to put an end to their\r\ntyrants as they were escaping in terror from their tottering\r\nhabitations? Revolt, then, was not unfamiliar to the Helots—again and\r\nagain was the standard of freedom unfurled[209]—and the day, though\r\nlate, at length came, when the Spartan saw his slave placed on a level\r\nwith himself.[210]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Even in\r\nboyhood and among themselves, they practised _gouging_ as an\r\naccomplishment, and as an Athenian did music—as a necessary consequence,\r\neven the writers most favourable to their state, confess them to have\r\nbeen brutal, inhuman, perfidious.[212] Nor among a people so ignorant,\r\nso prejudiced, so narrow-minded, whose understandings were possibly\r\nincapable of comprehending the idea of justice or liberality, can we\r\naltogether wonder at such an outbreak of barbarism. Men have been known\r\nin modern times to shoot slaves for their amusement; a king of France\r\nhas been known from the same motive to shoot his subjects, and a learned\r\nprofessor,[213] not very remarkable for cruelty, has pronounced the\r\npanegyric of that king. There is nothing, therefore, at all incredible\r\nin the Spartan Crypteia, which exactly harmonizes with all we know of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:\r\n\r\n  Ælian. vi. i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\n  In justification of this harsh view of the Spartan character, numerous\r\n  ancient authorities of the greatest weight may be cited.

In the\r\n  Acharnes (v. 306, seq.) Aristophanes, again, briefly but energetically\r\n  describes the character which the Spartans enjoyed in Greece:\r\n\r\n                      Πῶς δὲ γ᾽ ἂν καλῶς λέγοις ἂν,\r\n                      εἴπερ ἐσπείσω γ᾽ ἅπαξ,\r\n                      Οἷσιν οὔτε βωμὸς, οὔτε πίστις,\r\n                      οὔθ᾽ ὅρκος μένει.\r\n\r\n  On which the scholiast remarks: ἐπὶ ἀπιστίᾳ γὰρ διεβάλλοντο οἱ\r\n  Λακεδαιμόνιοι· καὶ Εὐριπίδης ἐν Ἀνδρομάχῃ·\r\n\r\n  Σπάρτης ἔνοικοι, δόλια βουλευτήρια.\r\n\r\n  Τρία δὲ ἐγκλήματα παραβασίας προσέθηκεν αὐτοῖς· αἱ γὰρ συνθῆκαι διὰ\r\n  τριῶν τελοῦνται, λόγων, ἔργων, χειρῶν, λόγων μὲν, οἱον δι’ ὅρκων,\r\n  ἔργων δὲ, διὰ τῶν ἐν βωμοῖς θυσιῶν, χειρῶν δὲ, ἐπειδὴ αἱ πίστεις διὰ\r\n  τῶν δεξιῶν γίνονται. καὶ Ὅμηρος·\r\n\r\n  Δεξιαὶ, ᾖς ἐπέπιθμεν.\r\n\r\n  The passage in the Andromachè referred to by the scholiast occurs at\r\n  v. 445, sqq.

The achievement of the king is thus\r\n  related by honest Mezeray: Numbers of Huguenots having collected\r\n  together on the banks of the Seine his most Christian Majesty, from an\r\n  apartment of the Louvre “taschoit de les canarder avec sa grande\r\n  arquebuse à giboyer.” Abrégé Chronologique, iii. 1083.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAn attempt, however, has been made to explain the whole away, by the\r\nunauthorized inference, that in the casual glance which Megillos, in the\r\nlaws of Plato, makes at this institution, we have a complete description\r\nof it in all its features. But very far is this from being the case. The\r\nSpartan interlocutor is there making out a defence of his own country,\r\nand consequently alludes only to such points as appear capable of a\r\nfavourable interpretation. Of course he is careful to keep the massacre\r\nof the Helots in the back-ground; and merely says, “There is also\r\namongst us what is called the Crypteia, the pain of undergoing which is\r\nscarcely credible. It consists in going barefoot in storms, in enduring\r\nthe privations of the camp, performing menial offices without a servant,\r\nand wandering night and day through the whole country.”[214] This is the\r\npicture of a Spartan, dwelling on his own hardships; which, however,\r\nmust have been endured for some purpose, and what was that? If exercise\r\nand military seasoning were alone aimed at, where was the necessity for\r\nthat concealment, that lying in ambush, which the word itself signifies?\r\nIt is well known that the Helots were a constant terror to their\r\nmasters—that whenever occasion offered, they revolted—whenever any enemy\r\nto the state presented himself, they joined him—that they fled whenever\r\nflight was possible—and were, it is confessed, so numerous and so bold,\r\nthat Sparta was compelled, in treaties with foreign states, to stipulate\r\n“for aid against her own subjects.”[215] What more probable, therefore,\r\nunder the circumstances, than the institution of the Crypteia? What more\r\nin harmony with the genius of the people?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\n  Plat, de Legg. i. t. vii. p. 196. Bekk. Cf.

The Helots who were esteemed worthy of an “especial confidence were\r\ncalled ἀργεῖοι.”[218] This however, is no intermediate step, as it is\r\nnot said that their being thus called was necessarily followed by any\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n2. The ἐρυκτῆρες enjoyed the same “(especial confidence) in war.”[219]\r\nOn points of this kind it is necessary to rely on some authority, and\r\nthe historian adduces none.[220] It has, indeed, been conjectured, from\r\nthe derivation of their name, that this class of freedmen served as a\r\nbody-guard to their former masters. Positively, however, nothing\r\nwhatever is known of their condition.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\n  Müll.

With respect to the Desposionautæ,\r\nthey would appear to have been slaves brought up in their masters’\r\nhouses, and afterwards enfranchised, and ordered to be employed about\r\nthe fleet.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Thucydides,[224] the authority relied on, speaks only of those\r\nHelots who having served in Thrace under Brasidas, obtained\r\nenfranchisement on their return, together with a portion of the lands\r\nrecently taken from the Lepreatæ. On other occasions, as the whole of\r\nLaconia and Messenia had been divided among the citizens, it is\r\ndifficult to understand whence the state could have obtained lands to\r\nbestow. The _probability_, therefore, is, that they bestowed none.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  l. v. § 34.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf the Neodamodes or “new citizens,” our knowledge is little less scanty\r\nthan of the other classes of freedmen. That they were enfranchised\r\nHelots is confidently maintained by several learned writers, though\r\nothers suppose them to have been the sons of enfranchised Helots.[225]\r\nThis latter supposition, however, is inconsistent with the testimony of\r\nMyron, who observes, that “the Lacedæmonians often emancipated their\r\nslaves, some of whom were then called _aphetæ_, others _adespotæ_,\r\nothers _eructeres_, others _desposionautæ_; there were others whom they\r\ndenominated _neodamodes_, different from the Helots.”[226] Of those\r\nmodern writers who have treated of the Spartan institutions, some elude\r\nthe discussion altogether, while others acquiescing in the commonly\r\nreceived opinion contend, that the Neodamodes were those Helots who,\r\nhaving conducted themselves gallantly in war, had for some time enjoyed\r\ntheir freedom. But this decision, however plausible it may seem, is by\r\nno means satisfactory. For, wherever Thucydides, or any other historian\r\nof authority, has occasion to mention this class of freedmen, they\r\nappear to be carefully distinguished from the enfranchised Helots. Thus,\r\nwhen the companions of Brasidas, before spoken of, had received their\r\nfreedom, and were sent as settlers into the Lepreatis, it is added, that\r\nthey were accompanied by a number of Neodamodes.[227] But if this term\r\nsignified nothing more than Helots who had been rewarded with liberty,\r\nin what did they differ from the other Helots who had likewise been made\r\nfree? One learned commentator,[228] not without ingenuity, infers that\r\nthey were a class of tributary subjects inhabiting the neighbourhood of\r\nthe capital, on whom the right of citizenship had been conferred, though\r\nthey did not enjoy perfect equality with the elder citizens. But, as it\r\nis distinctly stated, that they were enfranchised slaves, we are\r\ncompelled to abandon even this hypothesis, and seek to discover some\r\nother clue to the truth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Arnold, in Thucyd. v. 34.

And yet, when sent together to Lepreon they are carefully\r\n  distinguished. See Hudson. Var. Lect. Thucyd. iv. 460. Bip.\r\n\r\nFootnote 228:\r\n\r\n  Morus. ap. Schneid. Ind. Græc. ad Xen.

Sicul. xv. 20.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnother class of persons[230] commonly ranked among the Laconian slaves\r\nwere the Mothaces,[231] to determine whose origin, rank, and condition,\r\nappears to be a matter of no small difficulty. That they never, during\r\nthe flourishing ages of the commonwealth, formed any part of the servile\r\ncaste may be regarded as certain, whatever may be found to the contrary\r\nin the grammarians of later times. For the Mothaces, observes Athenæus,\r\nthough not Lacedæmonians, were _free_. And to the same purpose speaks\r\nPhilarchos, whose words are: “The Mothaces were the brotherlike\r\ncompanions of the Lacedæmonians. For every youthful citizen, according\r\nto his means, chose one, two, or more of these to be brought up along\r\nwith him; and, notwithstanding that they enjoyed not the rank of\r\ncitizens, they were _free_, and participated in all the advantages of\r\nthe national education. It is even said that Lysander, who defeated the\r\nAthenians at sea, was one of this class of men, but raised to the rank\r\nof citizen for his valour.”[232] To the same section of the Laconian\r\npopulation belonged also Callicratidas and Gylippos,[233] a circumstance\r\nwhich of itself appears completely to overthrow the hypothesis of those\r\nwho derive the Mothaces directly from the Helots; for Cleandridas, the\r\nfather of Gylippos,[234] was chosen to accompany King Pleistoanax, as\r\nchief of his councillors, during an expedition into Attica, an honour\r\nwhich would not, I imagine, have been conferred upon a Helot. Again,\r\nLysander, whom by one authority we are taught to regard as a Mothax, is\r\nby another spoken of not barely as a Spartan, but as descended from the\r\nHeracleidæ.[235]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 230:\r\n\r\n  See Book ii. chapter vii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 231:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Schol. Aristoph. Eq. 632. Ubbo. Emm. iii. 132, seq.

By the same rule, the vicious\r\n  man who is one day to be virtuous, might, in the midst of his crimes,\r\n  be pronounced a pattern of morality.\r\n\r\nFootnote 233:\r\n\r\n  Ælian. Var.

Lysand. § 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHow then are we to reconcile these seeming contradictions? Probably by\r\nsupposing, that the Mothaces consisted, first of the sons of such\r\nSpartans as were too poor to defray the expenses of their maintenance\r\nand education,[236] which seems to have been the case with Aristocritos,\r\nthe father of Lysander, whose early indigence is celebrated; secondly of\r\nbastard Spartans, who it is well known shared the education of their\r\nlegitimate brethren; and thirdly, of the sons of persons of rank and\r\ndistinction among the Periœci. To these perhaps, in very late times, the\r\nsons of favourite slaves born in the house may have been added, though\r\nthere is no ground for believing that this was habitually the case in\r\nthe earlier ages. Be this, however, as it may, it seems to be quite\r\nevident, that Lycurgus laid much less stress on “birth and blood” than\r\non that steadiness and patience of toil which are the first qualities of\r\na soldier. Whoever from childhood upward gave proof of these, by\r\nsubmitting unmurmuringly to the rigorous trial he enjoined the youth of\r\nSparta, was elevated in the end to the rank of a citizen, while they who\r\nshrunk from the severity of his discipline, according to some even\r\nthough they had descended from the blood royal, sunk into a state of\r\ndegradation or were even confounded with the Helots.[237] Foreigners who\r\nenjoyed the privileges of this system of instruction received among the\r\nLacedæmonians the name of Trophimoi.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 236:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Xenoph. Cyrop. i. 2. 15, where the regulations of the Persian\r\n  system are evidently mere copies of those which prevailed, at least in\r\n  earlier ages, at Sparta. Plut. Institut. Lac. § 21, seq.

The testimony\r\n  of Dion Chrysostom (Orat. xxxvi. t. ii. p. 92), as we have seen above,\r\n  is in direct contradiction with this of Teles; but if we suppose them\r\n  to speak of different periods of Spartan history, they may both be\r\n  right.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf the Epeunactæ, a peculiar class of freedmen, we have the following\r\ncurious account: Having in the Messenian war lost a number of Spartans,\r\nthe government began to apprehend that the enemy might discover its\r\nweakness; to conceal which a Helot was substituted in the place of every\r\nfallen warrior. Shortly afterwards these men were raised to the rank of\r\ncitizens and denominated Epeunactæ, because they occupied the beds\r\n(εὐναι) of other men.[238]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 238:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 101.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut wherever men are base-minded there will be slaves; and accordingly\r\nwe find that, in all other parts of Greece, no less than at Sparta, this\r\nmiserable class existed for the performance of servile drudgery.\r\nPosidonios, the Stoic,[239] observes, that persons lacking sense to\r\nprovide for themselves, voluntarily became the slaves of any who would\r\ntake care of them. Thus the Maryandinians submitted to the citizens of\r\nHeraclea,[240] to be their perpetual serfs, stipulating only that they\r\nshould always be furnished with the necessaries of life, and on no\r\naccount be sold out of the country. They were in fact simply\r\ntributaries, as is implied in the verse of Euphorion, the epic poet,\r\n\r\n       “Gift-bearers called, who cower before their chiefs.”[241]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 239:\r\n\r\n  Ποσειδώνιος δέ φησιν ὁ ἀπὸ τῆς Στοᾶς, πολλούς τινας, ἑαυτῶν οὐ\r\n  δυναμένους προΐστασθαι διὰ τὸ τῆς διανοίας ἀσθενὲς, ἐπιδουναι ἑαυτους\r\n  εἰς τὴν τῶν συνετωτέρων ὑπηρεσίαν, ὅπως, παρ’ ἐκείνων τυγχάνοντες τῆς\r\n  εἰς τὰ ἀναγκαῖα ἐπιμελείας, αὐτοὶ πάλιν ἀποδιδῶσιν ἐκείνοις δι’ αὐτῶν\r\n  ἅπερ ἂν ὦσιν ὑπηρετεῖν δυνατοί.

Besides engaging in agricultural labours,\r\nthey likewise served on board ship, and consequently contributed greatly\r\nto increase the commerce and naval power of Heraclea.[243]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 84.\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

They were sometimes\r\nalso known by the name of Thettaloiketes. Archemachos, in his History of\r\nEubœa, affords illustration of a very curious point of ancient history\r\nmentioned briefly but with some variation, by Thucydides.[245] According\r\nto him, certain Bœotians migrating northward, founded Arnæa in Thessaly;\r\nafter which some returned to Bœotia, while, delighted with the land,\r\nothers remained, and became the voluntary villains of the Thessalians.\r\nHere, however, as elsewhere in like cases, it was stipulated that they\r\nshould neither be put to death nor sold beyond the borders; while on\r\ntheir part they agreed to cultivate the land and pay the requisite\r\ntribute.[246] On this account they were called Menestæ,[247] that is\r\n“those who remain,” which appellation was by degrees corrupted into\r\nPenestæ. Of these serfs many were richer than their masters.\r\nEuripides,[248] in his “Phryxas,” observes, moreover, that they were\r\nsometimes of very ancient families. Thucydides, on the other hand,\r\nrepresents them to have been the original inhabitants of Arnè, driven\r\nthence by the Thessalians sixty years after the Trojan war, though a\r\nportion of the nation had long before settled in Bœotia and joined in\r\nthe expedition against Troy.[249]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 244:\r\n\r\n  Valcken.

These were the aboriginal tribes of the island reduced to\r\nservitude by a nation of foreign conquerors. They were sometimes\r\nlikewise denominated Clarotæ,[252] from their having been divided among\r\nthe conquerors by κλᾶρος, or lot; or, according to others, from their\r\nbeing located on the lots of the citizens which were called κλᾶροι.[253]\r\nIn condition, the Aphamiotæ resembled the Helots,[254] and differed from\r\nthe peasantry, or Hypekooi,[255] in much the same degree as the\r\npurchased private slaves of the Turks differ from their _rayahs_, or\r\nsubjects. These are habitually protected from being sold out of the\r\ncountry; though in cases of revolt the captives are reduced to the level\r\nof the common slaves, and sold like cattle. Thus the markets of Egypt\r\nwere crowded with Cretans after the late revolt against Mohammed Ali.\r\nThird, there existed in every state in Crete a class of public bondsmen\r\ndenominated Mnoia or Mnoa, because reduced to that condition by\r\nMinos.[256] These serfs cultivated the public lands, upon what\r\nconditions is not exactly known: it merely appears that they were\r\ncompelled to furnish the body of the citizens a certain sum of money,\r\ntogether with a part of their flocks and herds and agricultural\r\nproduce.[257] That they were sufficiently numerous and powerful to\r\ninspire their masters with dread, is evident from the regulation by\r\nwhich they were excluded from the gymnasia, and prohibited the use of\r\narms.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 250:\r\n\r\n  See on the subject Classes of Crete, Gœttling.

Something of the\r\nsame kind took place during the month Gerœstion, at Trœzen, where the\r\ncitizens feasted their slaves on one day of the great annual festival,\r\nand played at dice with them.[261] Among the Babylonians, moreover, we\r\nfind a similar custom; for, during the Sacæan festival, which lasted\r\nfive days, and was celebrated in the month of August,[262] the owners\r\nwaited on their slaves, one of whom, habited in a royal robe, enacted\r\nthe part of king.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 260:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 84.\r\n\r\nFootnote 261:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 44.\r\n\r\nFootnote 262:\r\n\r\n  Λῷος among the Macedonians.

The Penestæ of Thessaly,\r\nand the Helots, often joined the enemy, because the neighbouring states\r\npossessed no similar serfs. But, in the case of the Cretan Periœci, the\r\ncircumstance already noticed of their not being allowed to frequent the\r\ngymnasia,[266] or possess arms, will account satisfactorily for their\r\nperseverance in the ancient manners, without supposing in them any\r\npreference for those manners, which, as they were deprived of all the\r\nprivileges of citizens, they could scarcely have felt.[267]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 265:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

They would seem to have\r\ndwelt chiefly in the country like the Cretan Mnotæ. In process of time,\r\nhowever, their multitude inspired them with courage; they assaulted and\r\ndrove out their masters, and, fortune favouring their enterprise,\r\nretained possession of Syracuse. Among several of the Italian states,\r\nthe subject classes were known by the name of Pelasgi. The people of\r\nRhodes reduced and kept in bondage the inhabitants of Caunos, and the\r\ncelebrated painter Protogenes[269] was the son of one of these bondsmen.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 268:\r\n\r\n  Herod. vii. 155.

Even those writers who might have been expected to enter\r\nfully into this matter, supply but slight and unsatisfactory\r\ninformation, either because they attached little importance to the\r\nquestion, or because it did not enter into their design to examine in\r\nall their details the poor-laws of Athens, or the numerous sources of\r\nprivate and public charity which circumscribed the operation of those\r\nlaws. To the best of my ability I shall endeavour to supply the\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier ages of the commonwealth there existed no class of\r\ncitizens so necessitous as to require the aid of charity.[275] The\r\ndemocracy was not disgraced by the beggary of one of its members; for,\r\nthough many, compared with their neighbours, might be poor, none were\r\nreduced to sordid indigence, or so lacked credit as to be unable to\r\ncommand the means of engaging in some profitable branch of industry.\r\nAfterwards, however, through the calamitous events of war, and that\r\ndeterioration seemingly inherent in all forms of government, the number\r\nof the indigent exceeded that of the wealthy,[276] (as in every modern\r\ncountry it does,) and distress and destitution occupying entirely the\r\nthoughts of the sufferers, corroded to the core that spirit of\r\npatriotism which had distinguished their ancestors. But the institutions\r\nof Athens, having been truly designed to promote the happiness and\r\nprovide for the wants of the people, the attention of the legislature\r\nwas immediately directed to the evil.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 275:\r\n\r\n  Before the establishment, however, of the Athenian commonwealth, when\r\n  Greece had not yet emerged from the period of barbarism, piratical\r\n  expeditions were, by many of the smaller states, undertaken for the\r\n  sake of providing for the poor. Thucyd. i. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 276:\r\n\r\n  Τότε μὲν οὐδεὶς ἦν τῶν πολιτῶν ἐνδεὴς τῶν ἀναγκαίων οὐδὲ προσαιτῶν\r\n  τοὺς ἐντυγχάνοντας τὴν πόλιν κατῄσχυνε, νῦν δὲ πλείους εἰσὶν οἱ\r\n  σπανίζοντες τῶν ἐχόντων. Isocrat. Areop. § 38.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs this was the first developement of the spirit of charity, it\r\nnaturally appeared feeble at the outset, and only acquired strength and\r\nvolume by degrees. A beginning was made in the case of those who had\r\nbeen disabled in war,[277] and of the children left behind by citizens\r\nwho fell in defence of their country.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 277:\r\n\r\n  Καὶ νόμους αὐτὸς ἑτέρους ἔγραψεν, ᾧν ἐστι καὶ ὁ τοὺς πηρωθέντας ἐν\r\n  πολέμῳ δημοσίᾳ τρέφεσθαι κελεύων.

Aristotle, in a passage of his Politics,\r\n  (ii. 5. 4,) has been supposed to attribute the honour of this idea to\r\n  Hippodamos, who, he says, proposed public rewards for useful\r\n  inventions, and maintenance and education for the children of slain\r\n  warriors. But St. Hilaire, who translates him in this sense, seems to\r\n  be mistaken. Aristotle says, that Hippodamos proposed such a law, as\r\n  if it were new:—“Now such a law,” he says, “existed at Athens, and in\r\n  other states.” Cf. Gœttling. ad loc. p. 327, sqq.

In the case\r\nof disabled soldiers the honour has, by some, been attributed to\r\nPeisistratos, by others to Solon. Bœckh, though he acknowledges that the\r\nlatter “certainly gave the example to Peisistratos,” considers it not\r\nimprobable that, for the benefit of this important lesson, humanity is\r\nindebted to the tyrant, who, he observes, “was of a mild disposition;\r\nand usurpers are generally glad to seize every opportunity of conferring\r\na benefit, with a view to make themselves popular; nor would the\r\nAthenians, with their hatred to tyranny, have attributed this honour to\r\nhim if he had not deserved it.”[280]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 280:\r\n\r\n  Publ. Econ. of Athen. i. 324.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf this I am not sure. Peisistratos, a consummate politician, having\r\nunjustly rendered himself master of the state, was, no doubt, careful to\r\nappropriate to himself as many as possible of the honours due to Solon,\r\nthe mildest of all legislators; and, if he abstained from abrogating\r\nsuch a law, might contrive to pass for its author. Certain, at all\r\nevents, it is, that a tradition long existed among the ancients which\r\nattributed the institution to Solon;[281] and however mild and popular\r\nin manners the tyrant may have been, it will still, perhaps, be\r\nacknowledged that in those qualities he was excelled by the great\r\nlegislator.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 281:\r\n\r\n  Schol. ined. ad Æschin. cont.

It did not,\r\nhowever, require them to be absolutely destitute before they could\r\nreceive relief. Any citizen whose property did not exceed three minæ, or\r\ntwelve pounds sterling,[282] was entitled to the allowance; to eke out\r\nwhich he might keep a small shop, or apply himself to any other branch\r\nof industry within his competence. The laws, in fact, were on this point\r\nexceedingly liberal, justly considering it to be the duty of society to\r\nmake up as far as possible for the injuries of fortune. There was little\r\ndanger of the state’s humanity being abused. The people themselves\r\nexamined into every case, which in a community so limited they could\r\neasily do, and afterwards it was still in the power of any citizen, who\r\nsuspected imposition, to bring an action against the offender before the\r\nSenate of Five Hundred.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 282:\r\n\r\n  Harpocrat, v. ἀδύνατοι.

We must not\r\nconceive of him as a miserable pauper whining to a board of guardians.\r\nHe understood the intent and meaning of the law, and certain that his\r\ncase entitled him to the relief it was designed to afford, he spoke\r\nbefore the Senate like a man claiming no more than was equitably due to\r\nhim; and too well assured of the humanity and justice of his countrymen\r\nto be under much apprehension. He kept a small shop, it appears, in the\r\nvicinity of the agora, and one of the principal points dwelt on by the\r\nprosecutor was, that he there drew together a number of saunterers and\r\nnewsmongers, such as usually at Athens frequented the shops of barbers,\r\nperfumers, &c., in that fashionable part of the town.[284] Another point\r\nwas, that he sometimes rode on horseback, which, in the opinion of the\r\naccusers, a man receiving aid from the state should not have done. But,\r\nto this part of the accusation, he replies, that, being so lame as to be\r\ncompelled to make use of crutches, he was wholly unable to answer the\r\nmore distant calls of business without hiring a horse, the expense of\r\nwhich only augmented his difficulties.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 283:\r\n\r\n  Bœckh.

Schol. ad\r\n  Æschin. cont. Tim. § 21. At times it would appear a man required some\r\n  skill and eloquence to plead his own cause; or a friend to speak in\r\n  his behalf, perhaps, when the number of applicants was very great. We\r\n  may gather thus much from the accusation of Æschines against\r\n  Timarchos, who, though a rich man, suffered, we are told, his old\r\n  blind uncle to inscribe his name on the list of the destitute. On one\r\n  occasion, moreover, when the uncle had omitted to attend on the proper\r\n  day, and had addressed a petition to the Senate to be allowed his pay\r\n  notwithstanding, Timarchos, who happened to be then in court, refused\r\n  to support his application, by which means he lost his allowance for\r\n  that Prytaneia. Æschin. cont. Tim. § 21. The Scholiast on this passage\r\n  adds, that they who petitioned the Senate appeared in person, bearing\r\n  in their hand an olive branch wreathed with wool.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 284:\r\n\r\n  Andocid. de Myst. § 9. Plut. Timol. § 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom these circumstances we may learn, that the Athenian government was\r\nby no means penurious in its appropriation of those funds which the\r\ncontributions of the wealthier citizens placed at its disposal.\r\n\r\nOn the amount of the daily allowance writers are not agreed, some\r\npretending it was three oboli, others two, and others an obolos. The\r\ntruth, probably, is, that, originally, it exceeded not a single obolos,\r\nbut that, as prices augmented, or, rather, as the coin deteriorated in\r\nvalue, it was found necessary to double the amount.[285] Whether it was\r\never raised to three oboli seems doubtful; the affirmation of the\r\nScholiast on Æschines[286] may be a mistake; but the mere fact that this\r\nwas the pay of the dicasts is no reason at all for calling the testimony\r\nof the grammarian in question.[287] Be this, however, as it may, in the\r\ntime of Lysias,[288] one obolos only was bestowed, and Bœckh has\r\nattempted, with much ingenuity, to determine the date of the increased\r\nallowance. It had not taken place, according to Harpocration, in the\r\ntime of Aristotle; but Philochoros, the next writer who touches on the\r\nsubject, observes, that it was nine drachmæ a month, or fifty-four\r\noboli,[289] which, omitting the fractions, is equal to two oboli a day.\r\nThe year in which Aristotle composed his treatise on the Athenian\r\ngovernment is not exactly known; it was probably, however, after his\r\nreturn from Macedon, 334 B.C. Philochoros was Hieroscopos at Athens in\r\nthe year of Corœbos, 306 B.C. He did not, however, publish his Atthis\r\ntill about the year 260 B.C., at which time the poor allowance had been\r\nraised to two oboli. The date of the increase, therefore, falls\r\nsomewhere within the preceding seventy years.[290]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 285:\r\n\r\n  That this allowance was not very scanty may be inferred from the fact,\r\n  that when the people of Trœzen publicly received the wives and parents\r\n  of the Athenians on their retreat from the city during the Persian\r\n  invasion, they allowed each individual only two oboli a day.

But, as Siebelis has already remarked, in exposing the\r\n  erroneous imputations of Vossius and Corsini, Suidas was himself\r\n  mistaken, or his text is corrupt; for Philochoros, to have obtained\r\n  the important office of Hieroscopos in 306, B.C., must have been then\r\n  at least twenty years old. Now Eratosthenes was born B.C. 275, Clint.\r\n  Fast.

Bœckh,[291] imagining that Meursius had\r\nreckoned them at five hundred, after remarking that the assumption is\r\nfounded on a false reading in Suidas, accepts the number as the least\r\nthat can be adopted. But Meursius,[292] in the passage referred to,\r\nassumes nothing; he does not even allude to the number at all. And, in\r\nfact, it will be evident, at the first glance, that no conjecture can\r\nhope to approach the truth where circumstances were constantly varying,\r\nadding to, or taking from, the number of those who required relief. This\r\nwas chiefly affected by the general poverty of the state, which\r\naugmented rapidly towards its decline, when the number of the aged and\r\ninfirm, not possessing three minæ, or twelve pounds sterling, per annum,\r\nmust, no doubt, have been considerable. On the other hand, having no\r\nlonger to defend its freedom, which was gone for ever, the children of\r\ncitizens falling in battle were comparatively few, and, accordingly, the\r\ngain on this item went to balance the loss on the other.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 291:\r\n\r\n  Pub.

The whole audience being assembled,\r\nthe herald introduced the orphan youths clothed in panoply of “complete\r\nsteel,” and then, with a loud voice, proclaimed what Æschines rightly\r\nregarded as a most glorious and valour-inspiring proclamation, viz.,\r\nthat the fathers of those youths, like brave and good men, had fallen in\r\ntheir country’s battles, on which account the state had undertaken the\r\ncharge of their bringing up, and now, on the verge of manhood, having\r\nadorned them with an entire suit of armour, dismissed them under happy\r\nauspices to watch over their own affairs, granting them, likewise, for\r\nthe day, the most honourable seats in the theatre.[294]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 293:\r\n\r\n  Isocrat. de Pac. § 29.

This description, however, of Eranos constituted only one\r\nbranch of the numerous Clubs, Companies, Associations, Trades-unions,\r\n&c., which, like the Clubs of the Civil Wars[297] and Associations of a\r\nstill later date, occasionally assumed a political character and impeded\r\nthe movements of the machinery of the state.[298] These societies were\r\ninstituted with various objects. In the first place they were\r\nestablished to defray by subscription the expense of certain sacrifices,\r\noffered up in behalf of their members who were called Eranistæ and\r\nThiasotæ. But under cover of this pretext combinations of an evil\r\ntendency were sometimes formed,—among the aristocracy, for example, who\r\nestablished the tyranny of the Four Hundred,—and these obnoxious clubs,\r\nvarying in character with the period, espoused the cause of freedom in\r\nRoman times, and were of course watched jealously by the\r\nconquerors.[299]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 296:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

Thus we find\r\nthree several motives,—religion, gain, and pleasure,—impelling men into\r\nunions of this kind, all recognised by law. The curious and intricate\r\ninternal structure of Athenian society lent itself readily to the\r\nformation of such clubs; the whole population having originally been\r\ndivided into four tribes, each tribe into three phratriæ,[302] each\r\nphratria into thirty clans (γενη), each clan containing thirty houses,\r\namong whom the honours of the priesthood were distributed by lot.[303]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 300:\r\n\r\n  Gaius. lib. iv. ad leg. xii.

But with\r\nthe trading companies we have, in this place, nothing to do; and if\r\nincidentally the other associations are noticed, it is simply for the\r\npurpose of more fully developing a system of which the Benefit Clubs\r\nformed a part. These evidently rose out of the Eranæ established\r\noriginally for purposes of pleasure: that is, a number of individuals\r\ndesirous of enjoying a more splendid entertainment than they could\r\ngenerally afford at home,[305] together with the society of their\r\nintimate friends, entered into a subscription[306] for the purpose of\r\ngetting up a public dinner during the celebration of the great national\r\nfestivals. In some cases the associations thus formed, pro tempore, did\r\nnot outlast the occasion, while in others the taste for social\r\npleasures, or the accidental meeting of congenial tempers, led to the\r\nestablishment of a permanent club, the members of which grew naturally\r\namong a warm-hearted people to take an interest in each other’s welfare.\r\nThe expenses of the sacrifices during these festivals were in part\r\ndefrayed from the revenues of the sacred lands, but these not sufficing,\r\nit was generally necessary to raise a common fund by subscription.[307]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 304:\r\n\r\n  A corresponding distribution of the humbler classes was effected at\r\n  Rome by Numa: Ἠν δὲ ἡ διανομὴ κατὰ τὰς τέχνας, αὐλητῶν, χρυσοχόων,\r\n  τεκτόνων, βαφέων, σκυτοτόμων, σκυτοδεψῶν, χαλκέων, κεραμέων.

To support these establishments,\r\n  therefore, numerous individuals were found who, notwithstanding that\r\n  they had children, bestowed the greater portion of their fortunes upon\r\n  them, thus manifesting, perhaps, the greatest enthusiasm ever\r\n  exhibited in the cause of good-eating.

It was common among the\r\nGreeks to indulge in feasting immediately at the close of harvest, both\r\non account of the plenty which then prevailed, and, because the great\r\nbusiness of the year being finished, they had more leisure to devote to\r\nenjoyment.[309] That these associations tended to generate and promote\r\nfriendship and affection among their members was well understood;\r\nwherefore in the ancient tyrannies they were rigidly prohibited,\r\ntogether with all common tables, educational establishments, and\r\nwhatever else, to adopt the expression of Aristotle, promotes reflection\r\nand mutual confidence.[310] It was supposed to be their interest to keep\r\nmen as far as possible in ignorance and distrust of each other. Hence\r\nall religions with a tendency to beget mutual love were proscribed (as\r\namong the Romans Christianity) as of an antimonarchical character. Thus\r\nMæcenas, as ardent a patron of tyranny as of literature, urged Augustus\r\nto persecute and proscribe all attempts at introducing new creeds, as\r\nfavourable to innovation or, at least, to change; to sworn brotherhoods,\r\nassociations, clubs, things in their nature hostile to monarchy.[311]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 308:\r\n\r\n  Etym.

At first it seems clear,\r\nas I have observed already, that their object was sacrifice, feasting,\r\nand pleasure. But it sometimes happened that, of the funds subscribed,\r\nsome portion would, after their objects had been fulfilled, remain; and\r\nif, when this was the case, any member of the club happened to fall into\r\ndistress, it was perfectly natural to think of applying this surplus to\r\nhis benefit.[312] From this the step was easy to subscribing expressly\r\nfor the purpose of relieving indigent members, which, at length, was the\r\npractice, though the gradations by which they arrived at it have not\r\nbeen accurately marked.[313] Arrian has left a curious account of a\r\nCeltic eranos established by a Hunting Club in honour of Artemis,[314]\r\nto whom solemn sacrifice was annually offered up. A fund was created by\r\nthe members of the club in the following manner: every one who caught a\r\nhare paid into the treasury two oboli: the capturer or destroyer of a\r\nfox a drachma, the fox being a mischievous animal and fatal to the hare;\r\nthey therefore considered his destruction in the light of a triumph over\r\nan enemy. The sportsman who took a roebuck (δορκὰς), which among them\r\nwas the noblest game, and the largest animal hunted, paid four drachmæ.\r\nOn the birth-day of the goddess the treasury was opened, and a victim,\r\nwhether a sheep, a she-goat, or a calf, according to their means, was\r\npurchased. Sacrifice was then offered, after which both men and dogs\r\nregaled themselves with a banquet. Bitches were on this day crowned with\r\nflowers, to show that the feast was celebrated in their behalf.[315]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 312:\r\n\r\n  Salmas. de Usur. c. iii. p. 50.\r\n\r\nFootnote 313:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

This circumstance has been noticed by Vandale: Plerumque,\r\n  (sicut ὀργεώνων collegia) cœtus ac fraternitates Baccho, Herculi,\r\n  Apollini, aliisve Diis consecratæ: quibus Diis ab harum fratriarum\r\n  membris, ut peculiaribus patronis sacrificabatur: atque hinc convivia\r\n  inter φράτορας celebrabantur: ad quæ communes illi sumptus sive\r\n  impensas pariter conferebant.

Schneid.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn all these clubs the chest was the soul of everything; for this being\r\nremoved the whole society fell to pieces.[316] Accordingly, to become a\r\nmember it was necessary to subscribe a certain amount to the fund, and\r\nall payments were made monthly.[317] As these clubs, moreover, were\r\nlegal, the person who neglected such payments could be prosecuted at\r\nlaw, as for any other debt; and what shows the importance of these\r\ninstitutions at Athens, the ordinances referring to them formed a\r\nseparate branch of jurisprudence,[318] to enter into which, however,\r\ndoes not belong to my present inquiry. The president or chairman of the\r\nclub was likewise treasurer, whether chosen by lot or elected by the\r\nmembers of the club, whose expenses and behaviour, while assembled, he\r\nappears to have regulated.[319] It has been seen that the meetings of\r\nthese societies took place during religious festivals; but whenever they\r\nwere called together, whether by business or piety, it was customary, as\r\nin all similar cases among ourselves, for the members to dine together.\r\nThey do not appear, however, to have possessed club-houses; but, like\r\nour literary men of the last century, to have dined at taverns or\r\nalternately at each others’ dwellings.[320] On these occasions it was\r\ncustomary to restrain their expenses within moderate limits, the object\r\nbeing rather the enjoyment of each others’ society than the indulgence\r\nof a passion for luxury.[321]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 316:\r\n\r\n  Van Holst, c. ii. p. 46.\r\n\r\nFootnote 317:\r\n\r\n  Harpocrat. p. 85.

But this supposition is,\r\nprobably, ill-founded; for, as the same individual was at once eranarch\r\nand treasurer, it appears exceedingly improbable that he should be\r\nchanged every time the club dined together. It seems to me more\r\nlikely,—and we are left to conjecture,—that an annual chairman was\r\nchosen to transact the general business of the society, while another\r\nindividual might be selected to fill the office of chairman for any\r\nparticular evening. Towards the close of the republic, when the worship\r\nof Serapis had been introduced, women would seem to have been received\r\nas members of Erani established in honour of that foreign divinity.[323]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 322:\r\n\r\n  Van Holst, de Eranis, p. 60.\r\n\r\nFootnote 323:\r\n\r\n  Bœckh, Corp. Inscrip. pt. ii. p. 162.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut as these clubs were only accidentally connected with charity and the\r\ncondition of the poor, I proceed to consider another species of Eranæ,\r\nconceived almost in the spirit of Christianity. Van Holst,[324] whose\r\nresearches on the subject of the Hellenic clubs, though pedantic and\r\nconfused, are not without value, denies that any permanent charitable\r\nassociations existed among the Greeks, though among the Romans, he\r\nconceives, they did. At the same time, he confesses what it were\r\ndifficult to deny, that the friendly subscription called Eranos derived\r\nits name and being from the clubs above-described. He contends that no\r\nclub existed with permanent funds for the relief of distressed friends,\r\nand that the relief actually afforded was the spontaneous effort of\r\nbeneficence and humanity. On this point he is at issue with\r\nCasaubon,[325] whom he appears, in some respects, to misunderstand.\r\nSalmasius, he conceives, comes nearer the mark where he says, that when\r\nany person was overwhelmed with debt or poverty, he found a ready refuge\r\nin his friends, who subscribed what they could, both to satisfy his\r\ncreditors and provide for his future subsistence. It was in the\r\ndischarge of debts, however, that men found most aid from their\r\nfriends;[326] though such subscriptions were set on foot on many other\r\noccasions, to redeem a man from captivity, for example, or to portion a\r\nfriendless girl, as was the practice also at Thebes.[327]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 324:\r\n\r\n  De Eranis, c. iii. p. 73, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 325:\r\n\r\n  Ad Theoph.

Epaminond. § 3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe mode in which this subscription was collected, and the principle on\r\nwhich the transaction was based, had something characteristic about\r\nthem. In the first place, the money resembled a loan (which, strictly\r\nspeaking, it was not), because, if the receiver afterwards became\r\nfortunate, he was bound to make repayment,[328] though while in\r\nunfavourable circumstances his mind was not oppressed by the\r\nconsciousness of being in debt, since no one regarded himself as a\r\ncreditor, or could ask him for an obolos. Salmasius observes very\r\njustly, that the greatest proof of generosity is to give without any\r\ndesire of a return, which the Greeks called eleëmosynè, or eranos of\r\nstrict charity. The second grade is, where money is lent to be repaid\r\nwithout interest, which our Saviour calls τὰ ἶσα ἀπολαβεῖν.[329] The\r\nlowest, where you lend, but on condition of receiving interest.[330]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  It ought, moreover, to be remarked, that these eranistic loans were\r\n  sometimes returned even to the children of those who advanced them.\r\n  Isæus, De Hagn. Hered. § 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 329:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Cicer. pro Rosc. Amer. § 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n  Salmas. de Usur. p. 672.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFor the repayment of money collected by eranistic subscription, no exact\r\ntime, it has been observed, was fixed. It appears to have depended\r\nentirely on the recipient’s sense of honour or feelings of gratitude.\r\nBut Petit,[331] whose researches on this part of his subject were not\r\nsufficiently exact, confounds the monthly subscription paid by members\r\nof a trading company or ordinary club, with the money which a man, aided\r\nby his friends, might be supposed to owe them, and says, that such-a-one\r\nwas required to pay it back by monthly instalments, or all at once\r\nwithin a month. The former would be the case were we to understand\r\nHarpocration to speak of this kind of eranos at all; the latter, if we\r\naccept his interpretation. But Van Holst[332] is right in remarking that\r\nPetit here apprehends the sense of the grammarian “minus recte”; that\r\nis, he mistakes it altogether. However, that the money was at some time\r\nto be repaid appears from a variety of passages. Theophrastus, for\r\nexample, in his Chapter on Grumbling, observes, that the querulous man,\r\nto whom a collection made for him by his friends is brought, will reply\r\nto the person who bids him to be of good cheer,—“Wherefore? when I must\r\nreturn as much to each of them, and be grateful, moreover, for the\r\nfavour?”[333]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 331:\r\n\r\n  Legg.

Of course, the\r\ncharacter of the entertainment depended on the wealth or munificence of\r\nthe Hestiator.[336] Necessary, it was not, that he should regale his\r\nfellow-tribesmen sumptuously, as frugality was one of the\r\ncharacteristics of the nation; but, at the same time, it is quite\r\nevident that on many occasions[337] the Feast of the Tribe was a\r\nmagnificent banquet.[338]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n  Athen. v. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  Harpocrat. in v. ἑστιάτωρ.

We only know that, when they were unable to contribute their\r\nshare to the maintenance of the public tables, they lost the privilege\r\nof being present, and had to provide for themselves at home in the best\r\nmanner they were able.[340] It would thus appear that their Phiditia\r\ndifferred very little, except in being more general, from the Erani of\r\nthe Athenians. As Laconia abounded with game, it may be conjectured that\r\nthe more indigent citizens frequently relied greatly for support on the\r\nchase,[341] to which may be added the charity of their wealthier\r\nneighbours, in whatever way bestowed. In Crete, the citizens being\r\nplaced more upon an equality, there was little room for extreme\r\npoverty.[342] The population, moreover, by artificial restraints, was\r\nkept within due bounds; consequently, most persons lived plentifully,\r\nand possessed wherewith to exercise the most generous hospitality. But\r\neven here they multiplied in later times more rapidly than the means of\r\nsubsistence, so that numbers of Cretans were fain to serve as mercenary\r\narchers in the intestine wars of Greece. The same remark will apply to\r\nthe Arcadians, and several other people whose poorer members earned a\r\nsubsistence by their hereditary valour.[343]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 339:\r\n\r\n  Vid.

Sometimes, however, if not generally, the meat\r\nfell into the hands of those who least needed it, while the poor got\r\nnothing but a little soup with a scanty slice of bread.[346] In times of\r\ngreat scarcity corn was distributed to the indigent in the Odeion,\r\nwhere, on ordinary occasions, it was sold.[347] A similar distribution\r\ntook place at the Peiræeus in the arsenal, where loaves were given out\r\nat an obolos each. On extraordinary occasions, as when a famine raged in\r\nthe country, the state applied for corn to its foreign allies, and, on\r\nreceiving any, distributed it equally among the citizens. This was the\r\ncase when Psammitichos made the Athenians a present of a vast quantity\r\nof wheat, of which every citizen received five medimni.[348] A peculiar\r\nkind of windfall is commemorated by Athenæus, who relates, that when\r\nIon, the dramatic poet of Chios, won the prize of tragedy, he was so\r\noverjoyed at his success, that he presented every Athenian with a jar of\r\nthe best Chian. No doubt, foreign tragedians were not every day winning\r\nprizes, or, when they won, so rich and generous as Ion; but advantages\r\nof various kinds were enjoyed by the Athenian people not anywhere else\r\nknown.[349]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 344:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

Thus, Chares is said to have\r\nexpended more than sixty talents, or near 15,000_l._ sterling in\r\nentertaining his fellow-citizens,[350] when the public tables were laid\r\nout in the agora; and Conon,[351] having obtained a great naval victory\r\nover the Lacedæmonians at Cnidos, and surrounded the Peiræeus with\r\nfortifications, offered a real hecatomb in sacrifice, and feasted the\r\nwhole body of people. Of these thoughtless donations the poor, of\r\ncourse, obtained their share. Cimon acted more judiciously and more\r\nnobly towards the unfortunate among his countrymen. Looking upon wealth\r\nonly as a means of recommending himself and obtaining friends, he set no\r\nguard upon his lands or gardens, from which every Athenian who chose\r\nmight freely take what he needed. His house, likewise, in the city was\r\nopen to all; a plain table being constantly laid for a number of men, so\r\nthat whosoever was at a loss for a dinner might dine there. He willingly\r\nobliged those who came daily to demand some favour of him; and is said\r\nalways to have gone abroad accompanied by two or three domestics bearing\r\nmoney, who were instructed to give to any citizen who approached him\r\nwith a request. He contributed also to the interment of many; and,\r\noften, if he observed a poor Athenian meanly clad, ordered one of his\r\nattendants to change raiment with him. By these means, as may be\r\nsupposed, he acquired marvellous popularity, and stood first among his\r\nrivals in public estimation.[352]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 350:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xii. 43.

Many, therefore, when reduced by misfortune, to a\r\nchoice of evils, preferred the bread obtained by honest labour,[353]\r\nhowever mean or ill paid, to so humiliating a dependance on charity;\r\nand, unable to obtain more favourable conditions, actually worked for\r\ntheir food.[354] To labour for hire they scarcely accounted a hardship.\r\nA large class of citizens, including women,[355] appear by this means to\r\nhave gained their livelihood, some as cooks, others as reapers, mowers,\r\nor any other description of labour which happened to offer itself.[356]\r\nPoverty sometimes drove the unprincipled poor to keep houses of ill\r\nfame. Others became itinerant flower-sellers, and cried “roses so many\r\nbunches the obolos;” or hawked radishes, lupines, or olive-dregs about\r\nthe streets.[357] And, after their death, the daughters of poor men\r\nsometimes joined the Hetairæ, not having been able to earn their\r\nlivelihood by needlework, weaving, and spinning.[358]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 353:\r\n\r\n  Alluding to the necessity of labour to the poor, Plato says:—If an\r\n  artisan happen to fall sick, he demands a rapid cure of his physician\r\n  by emetics or aperients, or cautery, or surgical operation. But if he\r\n  be recommended a long and careful attention to regimen, to tie up his\r\n  head and such things, he speedily replies, that he has no leisure to\r\n  play the valetudinarian, and that it is of no advantage to him to\r\n  preserve his life by such continual nursings, while his affairs are\r\n  going to ruin. Thus dismissing his physician, and returning to his\r\n  ordinary diet, if he recover he pursues his calling, if not he is\r\n  delivered from all his troubles at once.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus\r\n  entertained a strange notion of the θῆτες and πελάται of the\r\n  Athenians, whose condition he supposes to have been inferior to that\r\n  of the Roman clients. He pretends, indeed, that clientship arose in\r\n  Greece, and was only established by imitation at Rome: ἔθος Ἑλληνικὸν\r\n  καὶ Ἀρχαῖον, he says, ὧ Θετταλοί τε μέχρι πολλοῦ χρώμενοι διετέλεσαν\r\n  καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι καταρχὰς. ἐκεῖνοι μὲν γὰρ ἐπιτάττοντες οὐ προσήκοντα\r\n  ἐλευθέροις, καὶ ὁπότε μὴ πράξειάν τι τῶν κελευρομένων, πληγὰς\r\n  ἐντείνοντες, καὶ τἄλλα ὥσπερ ἀργυρωνήτοις χρώμενοι. ἐκάλουν δὲ\r\n  Ἀθηναῖοι μὲν Θῆτας τοὺς Πελάτας, ἐπὶ τῆς λατρείας Θετταλοὶ δὲ,\r\n  Πενέστας, ὀνειδίζοντες αὐτοῖς εὐθὺς ἐν τῇ κλήσει τὴν τύχην. Antiq.\r\n  Rom. ii. 9. Reiske very justly remarks on this passage, that he does\r\n  not see with what propriety the Thetes of Attica are classed with the\r\n  Thessalian Penestæ, in comparing them with the Roman Clients. For it\r\n  is most certain (as H. Stephens shows in his Schediasm. v. 15, seq.),\r\n  that the condition of the Penestæ bore little resemblance to that of\r\n  the Roman Clients. And as to the Attic Thetes and Pelatæ they were\r\n  completely free, though inferior in rank to the artisans (οἱ βαναυσοὶ,\r\n  Steph. Thes. v. θῆς); nor did they serve as slaves serve their masters\r\n  (ut δοῦλοι δεσπόταις); but, as appears from the Scholiast on Odyss. δ.\r\n  644, as poor and debt-oppressed persons hire their services to the\r\n  rich or to their creditors, who were denominated χρήστας, not\r\n  προστάτας, or δεσπότας. The condition of the Thessalian Penestæ was\r\n  different: for they were nearly slaves, μεταξὺ δούλων καὶ ἐλευθέρων,\r\n  as the ancients called them. (Pollux, iii. 83.) Those among them who\r\n  served in families were named θετταλοικέται. (Reiske, ad Dion. Hal. t.\r\n  i. p. 255.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 355:\r\n\r\n  Demosth. adv.

But at Athens, however temperate the climate, a shelter from the\r\ncold in winter is desirable, and here, therefore, as in every other part\r\nof Greece, the practice was to erect houses where, as in the\r\nCaravanserais of the East, any man, native or stranger, might enter and\r\nobtain shelter for the night. These buildings were called Leschæ,\r\nerected without doors, to intimate that all were welcome; and in them,\r\naccordingly, beggars and wanderers of every description congregated\r\nround great fires in winter and bad weather, both to sleep and\r\nconverse.[360] Even the citizens, particularly at Sparta, met in the\r\nLeschæ, to enjoy the delights of gossiping; whence any idle assemblage\r\nwas called a Leschè.[361] In a fragment of the lost oration of Antiphon\r\nagainst Nicoles, mention is made of these edifices, which served as a\r\nrefuge for the destitute. They were erected by the state; and, to cast\r\nover them an air of sanctity, dedicated to Apollo, who thence obtained\r\nthe surname of Leschenorios.[362] Nowhere were these humane institutions\r\nso numerous as at Athens, where, according to Proclus,[363] there\r\nexisted no fewer than three hundred and sixty, in which the indigent,\r\nwho had no home, might congregate together and keep themselves warm at\r\nthe nation’s expense.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 359:\r\n\r\n  Beggars sometimes sat down on the ground to eat what was given them at\r\n  the doors of the charitable. Thus in Antiphanes one says,—“What dost\r\n  thou say? Bring me hither to the door something to eat; and then, like\r\n  the beggars, I will despatch it, seated on the ground, and who will\r\n  see?” Athen. ii. 87.\r\n\r\nFootnote 360:\r\n\r\n  Etym.

Here they would seem to have pressed so eagerly\r\nabout the furnaces as to be sometimes scorched and blistered;[364] and\r\nthe crowd of poor wretches in this necessitous condition would appear to\r\nhave been occasionally so great as to deteriorate the state of the\r\natmosphere by their breath,[365] on which account they were exposed to\r\nbe driven forth by the bath-keepers.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 364:\r\n\r\n  Πλὴν φώδων ἐκ βαλανέιου.

These were the\r\ngrain-pickers of the Deigma and Agora, who hovering about where the\r\nfarmers and corn-chandlers meted their grain, and collecting what\r\ndropped from the sacks,[371] or was spilled in measuring, thus earned a\r\nmiserable subsistence. Persons of this description might eke out their\r\nlivelihood by appropriating to themselves the coarse brown bread which\r\npious and charitable persons placed in the propylæa of temples for their\r\nuse.[372] Here Diogenes, the Cynic, who, carrying about provisions in\r\nhis wallet, was independent of these offerings, sometimes dined; and,\r\nfor the sake of uttering a _bon mot_, threw out the loaves that might\r\nhave been useful to others; observing, that nothing coarse[373] should\r\nbe allowed to enter the temples of the gods.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 371:\r\n\r\n  Eustath. ap.

This\r\n  feast the natives affected to regard as a gift bestowed upon them\r\n  incessantly by the earth. Herod. iii. 18. Cf. Pausan. i. 33. 4. vi.\r\n  26. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 373:\r\n\r\n  Diog.

Diogenes, as the reader will perceive, meant to pun upon\r\n  the word ῥυπαρὸς.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nReligion has everywhere been favourable to the poor. On the festival of\r\nthe new moon, when the great and opulent offered up costly sacrifices to\r\nthe gods, as to Hecatè, for example, on cross-roads,[374] their more\r\nindigent brethren seized the occasion when their hearts were thus\r\nsoftened, to ask them for something. Thus Homer, according to the legend\r\nattributed to Herodotus, went in Samos to the houses of the wealthy,\r\nchanting his Eiresione, for which he received a consideration.[375]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 374:\r\n\r\n  These suppers were eaten by the poor, together with the eggs and other\r\n  small offerings used in purifying places.

In the island of Hecatè, on the coast of Delos, the Delians\r\n  used to dedicate offerings to Iris, of cakes called Basynias, made\r\n  with wheaten flour and honey, the offering called cokkora, a dried\r\n  fig, and three walnuts.

Antiphanes[378] describes a poor man’s meal as\r\nconsisting of a cake (μαζα),[379] bristling with bran for the sake of\r\neconomy, with an onion, and, for a relish, a dish of sow-thistle, or of\r\nmushrooms, or some such wretched produce of the soil, a diet producing\r\nneither fever nor phlegm. However, where meat is to be got, no man, he\r\nthought, would be contented with thyme, though he might pretend to rival\r\nthe Pythagoreans.[380] Mention, nevertheless, is made of two\r\nphilosophers who voluntarily subsisted all their lives on water and\r\nfigs, and grew very healthy and robust upon this fare, though their\r\nperspiration had so ill an odour, that every one avoided them when they\r\nentered the public baths. Pythagoras forbade his abstemious followers\r\nthe use of the mallows, upon which the humbler classes in Greece were\r\naccustomed to feed, together with the roots of the day-lily, the nymphea\r\nnelumbo, the nettle,[381] and various other wild plants. The\r\nKapparis,[382] plentiful in Athens, was very commonly eaten by the\r\nindigent, and hence “to gather kapparis” was at length considered\r\nsynonymous with “to be in want.”[383] Alexis furnishes us with a curious\r\naccount of a poor Athenian family’s provisions.[384]\r\n\r\n                 Mean my husband is, and poor,\r\n                 And my blooming days are o’er.\r\n                 Children have we two,—a boy,\r\n                 Papa’s pet and mamma’s joy;\r\n                 And a girl, so tight and small,\r\n                 With her nurse;—that’s five in all:\r\n                 Yet, alas! alas! have we\r\n                 Belly timber but for three!\r\n                 Two must, therefore, often make\r\n                 Scanty meal on barley-cake;\r\n                 And sometimes, when nought appears\r\n                 On the board, we sup on tears.\r\n                 My good man, once so strong and hale,\r\n                 On this fare grows very pale;\r\n                 For our best and daintiest cheer,\r\n                 Through the bright half of the year,\r\n                 Is but acorns, onions, peas,[385]\r\n                 Ochros, lupines,[386] radishes,\r\n                 Vetches, wild pears nine or ten,[387]\r\n                 With a locust[388] now and then.\r\n                 As to figs, the Phrygian treat,\r\n                 Fit for Jove’s own guests to eat,\r\n                 They, when happier moments shine,—\r\n                 They, the Attic figs, are mine.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 378:\r\n\r\n  Athen. ii. 56.\r\n\r\nFootnote 379:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Among\r\nthe Spartans, idleness, the vice of soldiers,[389] was regarded as a\r\nproof of rank; whence the remark of that disciple of Lycurgus, who,\r\nbeing present at Athens during a trial for this offence, fatal to a\r\ndemocracy, observed, that they punished the man for being a\r\ngentleman.[390] Solon, however, entertained little respect for this mark\r\nof gentility. According to his laws, of which the whole design was to\r\ncreate and preserve that feeling of manliness bestowed by the\r\nconsciousness of independence, the individual, who, possessing no\r\nproperty, refused to labour, was a bad citizen, against whom any one\r\nmight bring an action of idleness.[391] Draco, the most Utopian and\r\nsavage of legislators, punished vagabondage with death, or, according to\r\nsome, with infamy only. But Solon, who would not require too much of\r\nhuman nature, reserved this latter penalty for those who should be\r\nthrice convicted.[392]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 389:\r\n\r\n  Lord Bacon, whose opinions were chiefly based on the study of\r\n  antiquity, observes, after Plato and Aristotle, that military nations\r\n  will always be somewhat inclined to idleness, and should rather be\r\n  indulged in it than otherwise. Essays, p. 79. But both the Athenians\r\n  and Romans were a hardworking people, and better soldiers have never\r\n  been known. The best soldiers in the English army are drawn from the\r\n  central provinces, where industry most abounds, and the laborious\r\n  Normans are the best troops in France. Cf. Plut.

Sol. § 17.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has been conjectured, that Peisistratos was author of the law against\r\nidleness; by which he sought to compel as many of the citizens as had no\r\nvisible means of support, to take refuge in the country. Be this,\r\nhowever, as it may, it was not alone by severity, that the laws of\r\nAthens sought to recommend the pursuits of industry.[393] Superior\r\nexcellence in any useful art entitled a man to very high honours, to\r\nmaintenance at the public expense, in the Prytaneion, in company with\r\nthe chief magistrates and generals of the commonwealth, and one of the\r\nfirst seats at all spectacles and popular assemblies. But to preserve\r\nthis post, it was not enough to have once done well. The ambitious\r\ncitizen could maintain it only by persevering in the career of invention\r\nand improvement, for if another man in the same line were judged to\r\nexcel him, he relinquished to the new comer both his dinners and his\r\nseat.[394]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 393:\r\n\r\n  In Plutarch’s life of Pericles there occurs a very remarkable passage,\r\n  describing the constant employment and plenty which were diffused\r\n  through the city by the policy of that great statesman. As for the\r\n  mechanics and meaner sort of people, they went not without their share\r\n  of the public money, nor yet received it to maintain them in idleness.\r\n  By the constructing of great edifices, which require many arts, and a\r\n  long time to finish them, they had equal pretensions to be recompensed\r\n  out of the treasury, (though they stirred not from the city,) with the\r\n  mariners, soldiers, and garrisons. For the different materials, such\r\n  as stone, brass, ivory, gold, ebony, and cypress, furnished employment\r\n  to carpenters, masons, braziers, goldsmiths, painters, turners, and\r\n  other artificers; the conveyance of them by sea employed merchants and\r\n  sailors, and, by land, wheelwrights, waggoners, carriers, rope-makers,\r\n  leather-cutters, paviers, and iron-founders; and every art had a\r\n  number of the lower people ranged in proper subordination to execute\r\n  it, like soldiers under the command of a general. Thus, by the\r\n  exercise of these different trades, was plenty diffused among persons\r\n  of every rank and condition. § 12. Engl. Trans.\r\n\r\nFootnote 394:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph. Ran. 761, ibique Schol. Cf. Meurs. Them. Att. p. 106.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom this, and other circumstances, it would appear, that there were\r\nannual exhibitions of works of art and industry, in principle like our\r\ncattle-shows, when a careful scrutiny of every improvement and invention\r\ntook place, and the premium above described was awarded to the most\r\ningenious. It is very certain that an assembly of the trades, more\r\nparticularly of the bright-smiths, took place, on the thirtieth of\r\nPyanepsion, in honour of Hephæstos, or Athena, when the festival of\r\nPandemon, or Chalkeia, was celebrated; and the conjecture of Petit[395]\r\nis not improbable, that δεῖξις, or exhibition, then took place. It was,\r\nperhaps, on the same occasion, that the Athenian potters exhibited their\r\nmost beautiful works and models.[396] At Sybaris, the author of any\r\ninvention in the art of cookery enjoyed by patent, during the whole\r\nyear, a monopoly of the article; and in the same city, the dyers and\r\nimporters of purple, as well as those who caught and sold eels, were\r\nexempted from all taxes and imposts.[397]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 395:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Another law of Solon, which,\r\nat the same time shows the erroneousness of the common opinion\r\nrespecting the condition of women at Athens, proves that to bring\r\nindustry into good repute was a work of some difficulty. By this it was\r\nenacted, that any individual who reproached a citizen, whether male or\r\nfemale, with carrying on any business in the Agora, should be liable to\r\na penalty.[399]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 398:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Thus, an Athenian\r\ncitizen could not legally be a perfumer, that effeminate vocation being\r\nleft to the women.[400] Fishmongers, too, with butchers, cooks,\r\nsausage-sellers, fishermen, were held in low estimation both at Rome and\r\nAthens. Of all these Attic _pariahs_, however, the poor wretch who\r\nhawked fish,[401] and was contemptuously said to wipe his nose in his\r\nsleeve, or with his elbow, engrossed the largest share of public scorn.\r\nTo these we may add bird-catchers, and fruit-sellers, and those low\r\nblack-legs who subsisted on gambling.[402]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 400:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 94. xv. 34.\r\n\r\nFootnote 401:\r\n\r\n  In the Peloponnesos we find it was the custom for itinerant\r\n  icthyopolists to carry fish in baskets probably, suspended from both\r\n  ends of a rough pole (τραχεῖα ἄσιλλα) thrown across the shoulders.\r\n  This fact is alluded to in an Olympic inscription preserved in part by\r\n  Aristotle.

Eth. p. 63.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs an encouragement to the citizens to addict themselves to industrious\r\npursuits, foreigners, and all persons not free of the city, were legally\r\nincapacitated from carrying on business in the agora;[403] but this came\r\nin later times to be disregarded, since we find Egyptians, Phœnicians,\r\nand other aliens, possessing shops, and growing rich there. It was\r\nconceived, moreover, that, if men confined themselves to one calling,\r\nthey would arrive therein at greater excellence; and the law,\r\naccordingly, forbade them to be of two trades.[404] Plato, whose ideal\r\nrepublic was modelled in so many particulars on that of Athens, adopted\r\nthis law; and for the reason I have stated; comprehending thoroughly\r\nwhat advantages arise from the division of labour. He would not, he\r\nsays, have the cordwainer meddle with husbandry, weaving, or\r\narchitecture, that he might carry shoemaking to as great perfection as\r\npossible; and, in other branches of industry, men were in like manner to\r\ncultivate that only for which nature had fitted them, and wherein they\r\nmight thus excel.[405] The same philosopher, while on the subject of\r\nindustry, makes a remark worthy of consideration: It is not, he says,\r\nfor the interest of the community, that men engaged in any branch of the\r\narts should be so rich as to be independent of their business or\r\nprofession, which, in such case, they will be apt to neglect; or so poor\r\nas to be harassed in mind, or cramped in the means of carrying on their\r\noccupations satisfactorily. In these things, as in every other, a\r\ncomfortable competence is to be preferred to the extremes both of wealth\r\nand poverty.[406]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 403:\r\n\r\n  Demosth. in Eubulid. § 10.

Vestiges of this\r\ncurious state of things are supposed to be discernible in the history of\r\nAttica, even so late as the age of Pericles, when we find Socrates a\r\nmember of the Dædalian clan, by profession a sculptor. There were\r\ncertainly in religious matters hereditary offices, which none could with\r\npropriety fill but the members of a certain family or clan. Thus, from\r\namong the Eteobutadæ was chosen the priestess of Athena Polias, who\r\nresided in the temple on the Acropolis; and the priest of Poseidon was\r\ndrawn by lot from the same house.[409] To the Praxiergidæ were entrusted\r\ncertain duties about the statue of Athena during the Plynterian\r\nfestival.[410] The descendants of Buzyges performed those sacred\r\nceremonies which thrice a year attended the ploughing of the soil;[411]\r\nto mention for the present no more.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 407:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plut. Sol. § 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 408:\r\n\r\n  The younger Ilgen, for example, has written a clever work, in which he\r\n  endeavours to prove the existence of a system of castes in Athenian\r\n  society. He sets out with giving an account of the four ancient\r\n  tribes, and explains the appellations bestowed on them, viz. Γελέοντες\r\n  or Τελέοντες, Ἀργαδεῖς, Αἰγικορεῖς and Ὅπλητες, to denote the pursuits\r\n  in which the members of those tribes were engaged. This done, he draws\r\n  his conclusion: “Quod si verum est,” says he, “efficitur, Tribus hasce\r\n  nihil aliud fuisse, quàm ordines variis negotiis distinctos et\r\n  separatos, quales apud Ægyptos et Indos cognovimus, et quos Lusitano\r\n  vocabulo Castas appellare solemus. Tale vero institutum num apud\r\n  Atticos exstiterit, multum à viris doctis est dubitatum. At licet\r\n  sint, quæ in contrariam sententiam aliquem ducere possint, tamen\r\n  argumenta, quæ revera Tribus castis orientalibus similes fuisse\r\n  suadent, tam sunt et multa et gravia, ut non debeat dubitari.”\r\n  Disquisit. de Trib.

Thus the Potter’s boy, as Plato[414]\r\nremarks, long ministers to his father before he takes the clay into his\r\nown hands and begins to model a vase or tureen.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 412:\r\n\r\n  See the Hindoos, vol. i. p. 111, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 413:\r\n\r\n  When, however, they were put out to other masters an agreement,\r\n  corresponding to our indentures, was drawn up, in which it was stated\r\n  what they were to be taught.

Of the absurdity of this practice Herodotus was fully sensible,\r\nfor he observes, that a man was chosen to be a herald not for the\r\nloudness of his voice, but because he was a herald’s son.[415] Upon the\r\nwhole, however, the practice was no more general among the Greeks than\r\nit is in England. When it became fashionable to ape gentility, rustic\r\nhinds, like Strepsiades in the “Clouds,” found their sons ashamed of the\r\nhumble callings by which their childhood had been supported; a passion\r\nfor aristocratic distinction infested the bosom of the vulgar; all\r\ndesired to appear what they were not; and, despite the wise institutions\r\nof Solon, handicraftsmen and artificers sunk into hopeless\r\ncontempt.[416] For this reason most trades by degrees were exercised by\r\nforeigners, who frequently acquired wealth and independence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 415:\r\n\r\n  Herod. vi. 60.\r\n\r\nFootnote 416:\r\n\r\n  Muret, in Arist.

For example, in the\r\noccupation of a common fisherman, from which little beyond penury could\r\nbe hoped for, and which impressed upon the countenance that sordid\r\naspect so successfully represented by Hellenic art,[417] there were\r\nalways numbers ready to engage. And yet consider in Theocritus[418]\r\ntheir wretched life, sleeping in their weather-beaten hut on the bleak\r\nshore, amid heaps of nets, piscatory baskets, lines, &c., and there\r\ndreaming, as indigence often does, of discovered treasures and ingots of\r\ngold. The patient endurance of the hungry fishers, seated far above the\r\nwater on steep rocks, watching the entrance of the huge prey into their\r\nnets, appears to have been proverbial.[419]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 417:\r\n\r\n  See the statue of the fisherman, British Museum, Gallery of\r\n  Antiquities, Room vi.

On this passage Coste\r\n  has the following note: “En Hollande on paye dans le bateau, environ à\r\n  mi-chemin du lieu où l’on va.” This last regulation, as most persons\r\n  know, has been adopted by our coast steamers.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the superior trades and manufactures there was among several cities\r\nan emulation, the result of which was to produce constant improvement.\r\nAthens, for example, which excelled in pottery, had rivals in Aulis,\r\nRhodes, Megara, Corinth, Cnidos, and several other cities; Sicily and\r\nBœotia were famous for their chariots; Argos for the manufacture of\r\narms; Thessaly for its easy chairs; Chios and Miletos for their beds;\r\nEtruria for its gold-plate and works in bronze.[420]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 420:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 49, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that into the practice of the several trades and\r\nuseful arts we can see but a very little way. In order, however, to\r\nrender our idea of Hellenic civilisation as complete as possible, I\r\nshall here bring together as many particulars as I have been able to\r\ndiscover on this subject, commencing with those trades which were of\r\nprimary necessity.[421] Of these, that of the miller may doubtless be\r\nregarded as of the first importance. In very early ages men understood\r\nnot the art of reducing corn into meal; but either roasted the unripe\r\nears upon the fire, or parched the separated grains in small\r\nfryingpans.[422] In process of time, however, the pestle and mortar were\r\ninvented, by means of which,[423] though at a great expense of labour,\r\nflour of the finest possible quality could be obtained. To these\r\nsucceeded the handmill, an invention of very remote ages,[424] which,\r\nnotwithstanding, continued in use down to the days of Cicero. This\r\nmachine, both in Greece and Italy, was at first commonly worked by\r\nwomen,[425] more especially by female slaves. But afterward the rudest\r\nand worst conducted of the male domestics were condemned to this severe\r\ntoil, which at length grew to be regarded in the light of a\r\npunishment,[426] as working at the treadmill with us. Among the wealthy,\r\neach master of a family possessed his own mill; but as civilisation\r\nadvanced, the grinding of corn constituted a separate occupation, and\r\nthe trade of the miller was established. Public mills[427] were common\r\nat Athens in the time of Socrates, and it does not appear to have been\r\nunusual for strong and sturdy men of free condition to labour for hire\r\nin these establishments.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 421:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Paus. iii. 20.\r\n  2. According to Hesychius, (v. Μυλὰς) this hero Myles or Mylas was one\r\n  of the Telchines: Μυλὰς, εἷς τῶν Τελχίνων, ὃς τὰ ἐν Καμείρῳ ἱερα\r\n  Μυλαντείων ἱδρύσατο. The tradition attributing to this personage the\r\n  invention of mills is thus related by Stephanus: Μυλαντία, ἄκρα ἐν\r\n  Καμίρῳ τῆς Ῥόδου. Μυλάντιοι, θεοί ἐπιμύλιοι. ἀπὸ Μύλαντος ἀμφότερα,\r\n  τοῦ καὶ πρώτου εὑρόντος ἐν τῷ βίῳ τὴν τοῦ μύλου χρῆσιν.

Pac. 304. The ancients appear to have been\r\n  partial to small bread, since we find that four or even eight loaves\r\n  were sometimes made from a chœnix of flour. Schol. Vesp. 440.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus we find that the philosophers Menedemos and Asclepiades, when young\r\nand poor, earned their subsistence, and were enabled to pursue the study\r\nof philosophy, by working at night in a mill.[428] As few persons knew\r\nthis circumstance, and they were observed all day among the learned in\r\nthe schools, some one brought against them an accusation of idleness,\r\nfor which they were cited before the senate of Areopagos. In order to\r\nprove that they gained their livelihood in an honest way, the miller for\r\nwhom they worked was brought forward. His testimony confirmed their\r\nstatement; and he added, moreover, that he paid to each of them two\r\ndrachmas per night. The Areopagites were so pleased with this proof of\r\ntheir industry and passion for philosophy, that, on pronouncing their\r\nacquittal, they at the same time made them a present of two hundred\r\ndrachmas.[429] But these mills were not always put in motion by the hand\r\nof man. Yoked to beams projecting from the upper millstone, oxen and\r\nasses, moving about in a circle, blindfold, as at present, when\r\nsimilarly employed, sometimes turned the mill instead of slaves.[430]\r\nUpon the construction of these machines little exact information was\r\npossessed before the laying open of the ruins of Pompeii, where, in a\r\nbaker’s shop, four mills, still almost perfect, have been discovered.\r\nThey consist of a round stone basement with a rim, from the centre of\r\nwhich springs a blunt cone: this is the nether millstone. The upper one\r\nconsists of an imperfect cylinder, hollowed out within, like an\r\nhour-glass, one part of which fits like a cap upon the cone below, while\r\nthe other expands its bell-mouth above. Into this the corn was poured,\r\nand, descending through four small apertures upon the nether stone, was,\r\nby the turning round of the upper one thereon, reduced to meal, which\r\npassed gradually down, fining as it went, and fell out upon the stone\r\nbasement below. The corn having been ground, the next operation was, to\r\nsever the flour from the bran, though sometimes bread was made from it\r\nin the rough,[431] and regarded, moreover, as extremely wholesome.\r\nFirst, and most simple of these contrivances, was the sieve,[432] made\r\nwith slender rushes, which separated the coarse bran and produced a meal\r\nsufficiently cleansed for household bread. A much superior sieve was\r\nmanufactured with linen threads, by which the flour was bolted to a\r\ngreat degree of fineness. When it was required of still superior purity\r\nand whiteness, the bolter would seem to have been bottomed with threads\r\nof woollen, which, being woven close, allowed nothing but particles of\r\nthe utmost tenuity to pass.[433] All the above operations were supposed\r\nto be placed under the superintendence of a particular deity named\r\nEunostos,[434] of whom no mention, I believe, is made in modern systems\r\nof mythology.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 428:\r\n\r\n  Cleanthes, the disciple of Zeno, earned his subsistence by drawing\r\n  water during the night.

Several\r\nother substances were likewise used for the same purpose, not for the\r\nsake of adulteration, but either to improve the taste, or from reasons\r\nof economy; such as the root of the lotos,[438] and, perhaps, of the\r\nday-lily[439] dried, and reduced, like wheat itself, to flour; and the\r\nroot of the corn-flag,[440] which was previously boiled, and, for the\r\nsake of communicating a sweet taste to the bread, would appear to have\r\nbeen mixed with the dough as the meal of the potato is in modern times.\r\nThis plant grew most plentifully in grounds frequented by the mole,\r\nwhich loved to feed upon it. Another ingredient often mixed with bread\r\nwas, the pulpy seed of the Star of Bethlehem,[441] of which the root\r\nlikewise was eaten, both raw and cooked.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 435:\r\n\r\n  A fine light bread was made of the three months summer wheat.

Among\r\nthe Thracians, about the river Strymon, they made bread from the flour\r\nof the water-caltron,[443] a prickly root of a triangular form, which\r\nabounds in the lagoons about Venice, where it is sold commonly in the\r\nmarket-places, and roasted for the table in hot embers.[444] The root of\r\nthe dragon-wort,[445] eaten both raw and cooked in Greece, was, in the\r\nBalearic isles, served up fried with honey at banquets instead of cakes.\r\nThey gathered it in harvest time, and, having roasted, cut it in slices,\r\nwhich were then strung on a cord and dried in the shade for keeping. The\r\nseeds of the garden poppy were used in bread-making, perhaps like\r\ncarraway-seeds with us, as were those of the wild poppy for medicinal\r\npurposes in honeycakes, and certain kinds of sweetmeats.[446] They had\r\nin Syria a kind of bread made of mulberries, which caused the hair of\r\nthose who habitually fed on it to fall off.[447]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 442:\r\n\r\n  Μελανθίον.

The Lydian bakers, for example,[449]\r\nlike those of France and Germany among us, enjoyed considerable\r\ncelebrity, as did likewise the Cappadocians and Phœnicians, the art of\r\nthe last having been able, it is said, to vary the qualities of the loaf\r\nevery day in the year.[450]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 448:\r\n\r\n  Lucian.

When the dough\r\nhad been properly kneaded and leavened,[452] it was removed to a table\r\nwith a rim, and fashioned into a variety of forms by the hand or with\r\nmoulds. The larger loaves were placed in rows in a capacious oven, in\r\nwhich wood had been burnt and raked out carefully. Sometimes, also, a\r\nfire would appear to have been kept up in an open space round the oven,\r\nhaving at the top a smoke vent. One kind of loaf was baked in a small\r\nfictile or iron oven, called cribanos,[453] which was either placed on\r\nthe fire, or surrounded by hot coals. There was another which they\r\ntoasted before the fire on a spit;[454] and a great variety of cakes\r\nwere baked on the live coals, or in the ashes.[455]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 451:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

Some of these were reckoned so delicate as to create\r\n  appetite, and to have the power of removing drunkenness, 74. At Athens\r\n  one of the most thriving departments of the baker’s business must have\r\n  been supplying the fleets and merchantmen with biscuits, ἄρτοι\r\n  ναυτικοὶ ξηροὶ, a sample of which we find a sailor presenting to his\r\n  mistress.

Upon the whole, however, the\r\nbread sold in the market-place of Athens was esteemed the whitest and\r\nmost delicious in Greece; for the Rhodians, speaking partially of the\r\nproduce of their own ovens, supposed they were bestowing on it the\r\nhighest compliment when they said it was not inferior to that of\r\nAthens.[456] The dimensions of loaves depended, of course, on the object\r\nof the baker, and varied from those of the smallest roll, prepared for\r\npeople of delicate appetites, to those of the enormous obeliæ, sometimes\r\ncontaining upwards of three bushels of flour, borne in procession at the\r\nfestival of Dionysos.[457]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 456:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 74.\r\n\r\nFootnote 457:\r\n\r\n  Poll. vi. 75. Tzetz. Chiliad. vii. 770.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe business of the confectioner was in scarcely less request, or less\r\nprofitable, than that of the baker himself. In most cases, perhaps, the\r\nfiner kinds of pastry were made by women,[458] whose taste and skill\r\nenabled them to gratify the lovers of delicacies with an infinite\r\nvariety of sweetmeats. The vocabulary connected with this division of\r\nthe art culinary is singularly rich, but, in many cases, conveys to our\r\nminds very little precise information. It may be inferred, however, with\r\nsomething like certainty, that the stock of an Athenian confectioner\r\ncontained most of those delicious trifles now to be found in the\r\nestablishments of their successors in London or Paris. It will,\r\nconsequently, be impossible to enumerate them, or to specify the several\r\ningredients which entered into their composition. It has already, I\r\nbelieve, been observed, in speaking of wine, that the ancients were\r\nexceedingly partial to sweets, which, in the making of their\r\nconfectionary, led them to the constant employment of honey. Most of\r\ntheir favourite cakes contained some portion of this ingredient,[459]\r\nsometimes, indeed, found in company with other articles apparently\r\nlittle calculated to combine with it. Wine, too, and cheese, and milk,\r\nand seeds, and the juices of vegetables, entered into the composition of\r\nvarious sweetmeats, which were occasionally made to keep long, as when\r\nintended for exportation; occasionally to be consumed at the moment, as\r\nthey issued hot from the oven or the fryingpan. To this latter class\r\nbelonged those delicate pancakes, the paste of which was poured liquid\r\ninto the fryingpan, then flooded atop with fresh honey, and sprinkled\r\nwith sesame and grated cheese.[460] The taste for the _catillus ornatus_\r\nthe Greeks appear to have borrowed from the Romans. This was a rich\r\ncake, composed of fine flour, kneaded with lard and the juice of\r\nlettuces, pounded in a mortar with wine, seasoned with pepper, and fried\r\nin boiling oil.[461] Among their pastry was a sort of pie made of\r\nvine-birds[462] and beccaficoes,[463] the undercrust of which, kneaded\r\nwith honey, was sometimes moistened at table in chicken-broth.[464]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 458:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iii. 41.\r\n\r\nFootnote 459:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 51, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 460:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 55.\r\n\r\nFootnote 461:\r\n\r\n  Id. xiv. 57.\r\n\r\nFootnote 462:\r\n\r\n  Ἀμπελίδες ἅς νῦν ἀμπελιῶνας καλοῦσιν.

The cake called\r\nChærinè, made with the flour of parched wheat and honey, was bestowed as\r\na prize on those who, during the Pannuchia, remained awake all\r\nnight.[468]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 465:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 55.\r\n\r\nFootnote 466:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 56.\r\n\r\nFootnote 467:\r\n\r\n  Poll. vi. 76.\r\n\r\nFootnote 468:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 56.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe trade of the butcher[469] was carried on at Athens by citizens,[470]\r\nwhose shops in the Agora would seem to have been extremely well\r\nfurnished, containing every variety of meat, from the chine of a prize\r\nox,[471] to the hind quarter of an ass.[472] Sheep’s and kids’ heads\r\nwere commonly sought to be rendered more attractive by having a branch\r\nof myrtle stuck between the teeth, whence one of the hetairæ was\r\ncompared to a goat’s head, because she often walked the street with a\r\nsprig of myrtle in her mouth.[473] The information which antiquity has\r\nleft us respecting butchers’ shops and implements is extremely\r\nimperfect. We are told simply, that they had chopping-blocks and\r\ncleavers, large axes with which animals were felled in the\r\nslaughter-houses, flaying knives, hooks whereon to suspend and display\r\ntheir stock, with scales for weighing meat.[474] A very curious anecdote\r\nis related of a Milesian butcher: there was a man named Killicon, who\r\nbetrayed his native city Miletos, to the Prienians. Among his\r\ncountrymen, who on this occasion became fugitives, was a butcher. This\r\nman fled to Samos, where he carried on his old business.[475] Some time\r\nafter Killicon himself came to that island, and going into the market to\r\nbuy provisions, by chance addressed himself to the Milesian butcher,\r\nwhose name was Theagenes. The man remembered the traitor, and when he\r\nwould have bought of him a piece of meat, desired Killicon to lay hold\r\nof the part he wanted, while he severed it from the carcase; then taking\r\nup an axe he smote off his hand, saying, “With that hand, at least, you\r\nshall never again betray your country.”[476]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 469:\r\n\r\n  Κρεωπώλης.

Aristoph. Pac. 359.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe vintners and tavern-keepers, who were tolerably numerous in\r\nGreece,[477] appear to have acquired much the same reputation as they\r\nenjoy in modern times. It was regarded as a matter of some difficulty to\r\ndiscover a jar of pure wine beneath their roofs; and, indeed, the honest\r\nvine-growers of the country are accused of having understood the art of\r\nmaking Bacchos acquainted with the nymphs on his way to the city. In\r\nother words they sold from their waggons in the Agora[478] a certain\r\nquantity of the Ilissos, mingled with the juice of the grape. The\r\ntavern-keepers, however, stood in very little need of their assistance,\r\nsince they were not merely adepts in watering and doctoring their wines,\r\nbut were skilful at giving short measure;[479] and yet understood\r\nvarious contrivances for alluring people to their houses. Thus one of\r\nthem, for example, used to present a club that dined at his tavern with\r\na kid,[480] reckoning upon paying himself by the profits of the\r\nwine.[481] However, when an opulent and delicate company honoured them\r\nwith their presence, they could, doubtless, supply wines of the finest\r\nflavour; and to render them still more delicious, they were accustomed\r\nin summer to plunge the flagons into snow,[482] or, occasionally, to\r\nmingle it with the wine, as is still the fashion at Naples and in\r\nSicily. Taverns, therefore, were furnished with ice-cellars, where snow\r\ncould be kept during the hottest weather. Alexander[483] found means of\r\ncarrying along with him a quantity of this article of luxury into India,\r\nwhere he probably treated Taxilos and Poros with iced wines. This\r\nachievement was imitated many ages after by the Khalif Mahadi, who on\r\nhis pilgrimage to Mecca traversed the desert accompanied by a numerous\r\ntrain of camels laden with ice and snow, the first, according to\r\nOriental historians, ever beheld in the Holy Cities. In the island of\r\nCimolos, people made use, as coolers, of deep pits, in which jars of\r\nsoft and tepid water,[484] and, doubtless, wine also, were\r\nrefrigerated.[485]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 477:\r\n\r\n  At the doors of these establishments then were probably, as at\r\n  Pompeii, holes bored through the stones of the foot pavement, raised\r\n  considerably above the road, to receive the halters of horses or\r\n  mules.

In the cellars of Pompeii, the wine-jars were\r\n  found ranged along the walls without stoppers, instead of which a\r\n  little oil was probably poured on the top of the wine, as at present\r\n  in Italy.

In\r\nLusitania, ten gallons of pure wine were at one period sold for\r\nthree-pence; at Athens the price of the metretes,[489] appears to have\r\nvaried from about one and eight-pence, to three and four-pence, though\r\noccasionally it rose as high as about ten shillings. Even of the\r\nMendæan, a wine of very superior quality, the wholesale price did not,\r\nat one period, exceed two drachmas, the metretes; but as the innkeepers\r\nwere accused of having made enormous profits, it is at the same time\r\nquite credible, that they should occasionally have charged an obolos for\r\nthe hemicotyla, especially to tipling women. Elsewhere, however, we find\r\nthe chous, or twelve cotylæ, sold for an obolos,[490] the price,\r\ndoubtless, depending partly on the quality of the wine, partly on the\r\nconscience of the innkeeper. For, notwithstanding that there were at\r\nAthens three magistrates charged with the inspection of wines,[491] part\r\nof whose business it probably was to prevent adulteration and exorbitant\r\nprices, the vintners, male and female, in all likelihood were an\r\novermatch for them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 488:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

To check the\r\nprogress of the second fermentation, they were sometimes in the habit of\r\ncasting a pumice-stone into the jar;[493] but where wine was so cheap,\r\nthere was little temptation to have recourse to any other art than that\r\nof watering a little, which, according to the comic poet, might proceed\r\nfrom a benevolent desire to keep men sober and preserve their\r\nhealth.[494]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 492:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

In this process the resin was pounded\r\nin a mortar, with a quantity of the pine-bark. Some persons allowed it\r\nto remain in the vessel, while others strained it off immediately after\r\nfermentation. The wine which was preserved by an infusion of pitch,[511]\r\nwas manufactured in the following manner: the pitch was washed with\r\nbrine and sea-water[512] until it whitened, then cleansed perfectly with\r\nfresh-water, after which an ounce or two was mingled with eight choes of\r\nwine. The saline wines were made[513] either by dipping the bunches as\r\ngathered into sea-water, or sprinkling them therewith, or pouring it\r\nalong with them into the press after they had been dried in the sun. But\r\nin whatever manner prepared, wines of this description were regarded\r\nwith an evil eye by physicians.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 510:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. v. 43.\r\n\r\nFootnote 511:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

Old wine, they\r\nmaintained, shatters the nerves and produces headache; new wine is the\r\nparent of horrible dreams. That which is middling, however, for example,\r\nabout seven years old, is liable to fewer objections, and may upon the\r\nwhole be drunk with some degree of safety. White wine, too, according to\r\ntheir opinion, is better than red, since it corroborates the stomach,\r\nand is, probably, that kind which, when of a proper age, produces\r\npleasant dreams.[545] Pure wine, in general, moreover, was admitted to\r\nimprove the health and beautify the complexion; and Pindar, whom most\r\npersons will allow to have been a good judge, though he could not, like\r\nAnacreon, dispose of a cask at a sitting,[546] declares in favour of old\r\nwine and new songs.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 544:\r\n\r\n  Id. v. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 545:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 47.\r\n\r\nFootnote 546:\r\n\r\n  This achievement the Teian celebrates in one of his own odes, a\r\n  fragment of which has been preserved by Athenæus, xi. 45.\r\n\r\n                   Ἠρίστησα μὲν ἰτρίου λέπτον ἀποκλὰς,\r\n                   Οἴνου δ᾽ ἐξέπιον κάδον.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf beer, though, as we have elsewhere remarked, it was familiarly known\r\nto the Egyptians,[547] as well as to the inhabitants of Gaul, Spain, and\r\nBritain, who manufactured it from barley and service-berries, as the\r\npeople of Dantzic now do from the hips of the wild roses,[548] we need\r\nsay nothing, as the Greeks were so ignorant of its nature, that when the\r\nTen Thousand met with a quantity in Armenia they diluted it with water\r\nas they were accustomed to do their wine, that is to say, entirely\r\nspoiled it.[549] The establishments of these vintners were almost of\r\nnecessity most frequent in the neighbourhood of the agora,[550] where\r\nthe rustics from the country congregated in crowds on market-days; where\r\nwere held also, on many occasions, the public assemblies; and where\r\nnewsmongers and loungers of every description most generally passed\r\ntheir leisure hours.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 547:\r\n\r\n  Athen. x. 12. i. 61.

But, as we are best acquainted with the features of that\r\nof Athens, if we can succeed in delineating a tolerably correct picture\r\nof it, some idea may, therefrom, be easily formed of all the others. We\r\nmust imagine, therefore, a large circular open space,[551] about the\r\ncentre of the city, surrounded on all sides by ranges of shops, temples,\r\nporticoes, and other public buildings.[552] It was traversed in various\r\ndirections by avenues of plane-trees, planted shortly after the Persian\r\nwar, which in summer constituted so many shady walks. About the middle\r\nstood the altars of Pity and the Twelve Gods, in a circle,[553] and near\r\nthem were the statues of Harmodios and Aristogeiton,[554] the\r\ntyrannicides, whose memory was cherished by the republic with the most\r\nreligious veneration. By far the greater part of the space, however, was\r\ncovered by rows of sheds, booths, and tents, furnished with seats[555]\r\n(the construction of which formed a separate branch of industry),[556]\r\nwhere every article of use or luxury known to the ancient world was\r\nexhibited with the utmost attention to display. Here were the\r\nembroidered veils, and shawls, and mantles, and sandals, of the mercer’s\r\nquarter;[557] there the chains of gold, the armlets, the anklets, the\r\njewelled circlets for the head, the golden grasshoppers, the seals, the\r\nrings, the agraffes, the brooches, the cameos, and every description of\r\nengraved gems which constituted the attractions of the jewellers’\r\nquarter. Here were waggons piled with jars, and skins filled with wine;\r\nthere huge pyramids of apples and pears, and quinces and pomegranates,\r\nand dates and plums, and cherries and mulberries, black and white, and\r\ngrape-clusters of every hue, and oranges and citrons, and rich purple\r\nfigs, and melons and water-melons.[558]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 551:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

In another,\r\nnear a lofty poplar,[578] stood the auction-mart where goods of every\r\ndescription,[579] including even libraries,[580] were knocked down by\r\nthe hammer. Close at hand, perhaps, stood the tempting booths of the\r\nchapmen who purveyed for the kitchen of the Athenians with hams, and\r\nsausages, and black-puddings,[581] and pickles, and cheese, and\r\npreserved fruits, and spices, from the farthest east. Here were the\r\nsellers[582] of salt-meat and fish from the Black Sea,[583] there the\r\ntoy-shops and upholsterers, while ever and anon the crowds that thronged\r\nthe passages were compelled to make way for a string of asses[584] laden\r\nwith vegetables or wood from Parnes or Cithæron, with the ends sticking\r\nout on both sides and threatening the eyes of the buyers. Sometimes a\r\nporter,[585] with a wooden knot on his shoulders, bore along, like\r\nProtagoras, a load of faggots, the size of which astonished the\r\nbeholders. At times, near the corner of the street leading from the\r\nEleusinian Gate, you saw a half-starved Megarean[586] sneaking through\r\nthe crowd and bringing along with him sucking pigs, and leverets, and\r\ncucumbers, and salt-fish, and garlic,[587] which if observed by the\r\nagoranomoi were, during wartime, seized as contraband. On the other hand\r\nthe broad-faced jolly Bœotian[588] came smirking and grinning, like a\r\nNeapolitan, with mule-loads of wild marjoram, pennyroyal, eaten by\r\nsheep, mats, lampwicks, fowls,[589] ducks, locusts, jackdaws,\r\nfrancolins,[590] coots, divers, geese, hares, foxes, moles, hedgehogs,\r\ncats, pyctides, otters, and eels, from Lake Copaïs. Here in rows stood,\r\nblack as chimney-sweeps, the charcoal-sellers from Acharnæ, with their\r\nmallequins and rush-baskets full piled before them.[591] Yonder were the\r\ncornchandlers,[592] surrounded by piles of sacks, measuring their grain,\r\nwhile a horde of ragged spermologoi[593] hovered round to collect what\r\nfell. Close at hand stood the flour-merchants, each beside his huge\r\ncovered wooden trough,[594] from which he measured forth flour or\r\nbarley-meal to the buyers. Beyond these were the stalls of the\r\nfishmongers,[595] the flambeau-sellers[596] and the shining jars of the\r\noil-merchants, piled in heaps to the roof of the booths. In other rows\r\nwere the shops of the potters,[597] where every variety of jugs, vases,\r\nand tureens, was exhibited with vessels of glass, and bronze, and ivory.\r\nHere and there, threading their way through the multitude, you beheld\r\nthe pedlar[598] with his pack of small-wares, the hawker crying his fish\r\nor fruit,[599] or vegetables, or sausages, or wild-fowl, laid out on a\r\nboard on his head; the female bread-seller, with a variety of delicate\r\nloaves and cakes piled up before her on a tray; the pastry-girl with\r\nsweetmeats; the flower-girl with nosegays of fresh violets from the\r\nmeadows of Colonos and the banks of the Eridanos and Cephissos.\r\nSheltered from the warm rays of the sun, beneath some magnificent marble\r\ncolonnade, or the portico of some temple or chapel, sat whole bevies of\r\nfemale flute-players, citharists, or dancing-girls,[600] calling forth,\r\nfrom time to time, whilst waiting to be hired for a party, bursts of\r\nmusic from their instruments, or humming a war-song, or a Palladian\r\nhymn, or a merry scholion, the favourite ditties of the Athenian people.\r\nNear these, as being folks of the same kidney, the jugglers, cooks, and\r\nparasites,[601] took up their position; the former two ready to be hired\r\nfor the day by the giver of some magnificent entertainment, the latter\r\nthat they might discover in what direction they were to ply their craft\r\nand ferret out a dinner scotfree. Near the Eurysaceum in this\r\nneighbourhood stood that eminence called the Hill of the Agora,[602] or\r\nMisthios, because servants, in lack of a master, collected there to be\r\nhired, as they still do at fairs in most parts of England. Somewhere\r\nclose at hand were the shops of those brokers who let out pots and pans,\r\nand lamps and plate, and the more delicate kind of crockery, to such\r\npersons as were too economical to keep such articles of their own.[603]\r\nIn the midst of this profusion of wares might be seen, at all hours of\r\nthe day, crowds of well-dressed persons[604] sauntering to and fro,\r\nchatting with each other, cheapening the goods of the shopkeepers, or\r\nlaughing and jesting with the flower-girls or fluteplayers. At other\r\ntimes individuals, by no means deserving the name of loiterers, came\r\nthither, either to post up a bill[605] of some article which they had\r\nfound, or in quest of some information respecting one they had lost,\r\neither from such bills or from the public criers who were there\r\naccustomed to make proclamation of treasure trove, or to cry that such\r\nor such an article of property had strayed from its lawful owner.\r\nOccasionally also people made known by criers what goods they had for\r\nsale.[606] The young men of rank, when fatigued by these promenades,\r\nused to retire into a perfumer’s or barber’s or armourer’s or\r\nbridle-maker’s shop,[607] overlooking the bustling scene, where they\r\ndiscussed nonsense or politics, according to their humour. Hither, too,\r\nthe philosophers came with a view to inspire patriotic and manly\r\nsentiments into the minds of these future rulers of the democracy; so\r\nthat at one period you might have beheld Socrates and Alcibiades and\r\nCritias, and Chæriphon and Crito, with Charmides and the divine Plato,\r\nengaged in those animated dialogues, the echo of which still rings\r\nsweetly in the ears of posterity. In some shops opposite these, as if\r\nwith a view to rival or eclipse them, or round one of the\r\numbrellas,[608] beneath which, on an elevated platform, the perfumers\r\ndispensed their wares in the agora, stood a group of sophists with their\r\nfollowers, such as Hippias of Elis, Prodicos of Cos, or the Agrigentine\r\nPolos, or Gorgias of Leontium, habited in purple robes, embroidered\r\nvests, flowered sandals, and with glittering crowns of gold upon their\r\nheads. Even their florid discourses, however, would fail to command the\r\nattention of their auditors when the youth of equestrian rank,[609]\r\nmounted on their chargers and drawn up in military array, swept round\r\nthe outer circle of the agora, paying devout homage to each divinity\r\nwhose fane they passed. Here also in a future age might be seen,\r\nstrutting to and fro, the orator Æschines with his arms akimbo and a\r\nfashionable little hat[610] stuck knowingly on one side of his head,\r\nrailing at Demosthenes, and pleading the cause of Philip. And here, too,\r\nthe night after the fall of Elatea, a very different scene was witnessed\r\nwhen the citizens from every side of the Cecropian rock rushed\r\ntumultuously hither in the wildest alarm, and either not reflecting on\r\nwhat they did, or through ill-judged haste, set fire to the sheds and\r\nbooths in order that they might find a clear space to deliberate on the\r\npublic safety.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 559:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

On compte 2000 chiffonniers, et à-peu-près un\r\n  pareil nombre de femmes et d’enfans exerçant la même profession, en\r\n  tout 4000.” Frégier, Des Classes Dangereuses de la Population dans les\r\n  Grandes Villes, t. i. p. 27.\r\n\r\nFootnote 594:\r\n\r\n  Τηλία.

These servants of the commonwealth, five in the city and\r\nfive in the Peiræeus, were denominated Agoranomoi, and paraded all day\r\nto and fro, armed with whips of many thongs,[611] amid the crowds of\r\nbuyers and sellers, both to preserve tranquillity in the market, and\r\nprevent or punish those petty acts of fraud and injustice to which\r\npersons who subsist by humble traffic are too often in all countries\r\naddicted. Thus we find that, not the vintners only, but even the\r\ncornchandlers kept small measures;[612] though, as there was a public\r\nmeter appointed by the state, it could only be when purchasers neglected\r\nto employ him, that they lay open to this sort of imposition. Chapmen\r\ndetected in cheating, or otherwise behaving with impropriety, were\r\nscourged by the Agoranomoi on the spot; and it is to be presumed, that,\r\nas often as necessary, these officers were attended by a detachment of\r\nthat powerful and vigilant Scythian police, at one period a thousand\r\nstrong, which Athens constantly maintained, and which formerly pitched\r\nits tents in the agora.[613] Another duty of the Agoranomoi[614] was to\r\ncollect the tolls paid by Bœotians, Æginetæ, or Megareans, upon\r\nwhatever articles they brought to the Athenian market. It should here be\r\nobserved, however, that neither corn nor bread was in later times, at\r\nleast, placed under the inspection of these magistrates, since there\r\nwere others called Sitophylaces,[615] whose business it was to see that\r\nthe public were not defrauded in such articles. The number of these\r\nofficers, at first three, was afterwards increased to fifteen, of which\r\nten presided over the city corn-market, and five over that of the\r\nharbour, where a portico was built by Pericles[616] for the special use\r\nof the cornchandlers and flour-merchants.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 611:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph.

In the\r\nlater, and what are called the more flourishing, ages of the\r\ncommonwealth, a sheep, according to its age, size, and breed, fetched\r\nfrom ten to twenty drachmas, an ox from fifty to a hundred. The price of\r\na fine saddle-horse, in the age of Pericles, was twelve minæ, or about\r\nfifty pounds sterling,[619] but a common animal for draught might be\r\nobtained for three minæ. The price of thirteen talents paid by Alexander\r\nfor Bucephalos was a mere arbitrary piece of extravagance. A yoke of\r\nmules sold from five to eight minas; asses sometimes for thirty\r\ndrachmas;[620] a sucking-pig for three drachmas;[621] a dove or a crow\r\nfetched three oboloi; a jackdaw or a partridge one obolos, though the\r\nphilosopher Aristippos chose to give fifty drachmas for a single bird of\r\nthis kind; seven chaffinches for an obolos. A chœnix of olives cost\r\ntwo chalci, and a cotyla of the best Attic honey five drachmas.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 617:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Bœckh. Pub. Econ. i. 101, sqq. Diog. Laert. vi. 35.

From this it\r\nfollows, that they must have been of spacious dimensions; and it is\r\nextremely probable that they were fitted up with every attention to show\r\nand elegance. They necessarily contained a number of seats and chairs\r\nfor the accommodation of customers, and there can scarcely be a doubt,\r\nthat the various unguents, perfumes, oils, and essences, were ranged on\r\nshelves, along the walls, in fine jars, vases of Cyprian marble, and\r\nboxes of alabaster,[633] sometimes of one piece, with vessels of glass\r\nand silver,[634] or fine earthenware, or porcelain, or beautiful\r\nsea-shells.[635] The counters were probably of marble or polished stone,\r\nas at Pompeii; and the shopman was supplied with the usual paraphernalia\r\nof scales and weights,[636] and measures, and ladles, and spoons, and\r\nspatulæ, as in modern times. Peron, an Egyptian, the owner of one of\r\nthese shops, has been thought of sufficient consequence to have his name\r\ntransmitted to posterity.[637]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 632:\r\n\r\n  Demosth. in Olymp. § 3.

For, in order apparently to tax a person with excessive\r\n  extravagance, he is said to have purchased unguents of Peron wherewith\r\n  to anoint the feet of some friend or patron. Athen. xv. 40. xii. 78.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom the richness and variety of odours made use of by the ancients we\r\nmay infer, that the fragrance of such an establishment at Athens,\r\nexceeded that of Araby the Blest. For every land and every sweet flower\r\nthat grew supplied some ingredient to the endless stock of the\r\nperfumer.[638] There was incense, and frankincense, and spikenard,[639]\r\nand myrrh, and oils of saffron and cinnamon,[640] and sweet\r\nmarjoram,[641] and fenugreek,[642] and roses,[643] and hyoscyamos,[644]\r\nand maiden’s hair,[645] and iris,[646] and lilies,[647] and watermint,\r\nand rosemary, and eastern privet,[648] and baccharis,[649] and thyme. In\r\ntruth the Athenians, who were esteemed the inventors of all good and\r\nuseful things,[650] delighted exceedingly in the luxury of sweet smells,\r\nand therefore culled from Sicily, and Egypt, and Phœnicia, and Lydia,\r\nand Babylonia, and India, and Arabia, whatever could communicate a\r\npleasing scent to their garments,[651] their apartments, or their\r\nbeards. Even the doves and swallows that flew tame about the house had\r\ntheir feathers drenched with odoriferous essences, which they scattered\r\nwith their waving wings through the air.[652] This excessive passion for\r\nperfumes rendered the favourite articles of it dear, so that of some\r\nkinds a cotyla sold for two or five minæ;[653] of others, for ten; while\r\nthe balm of Gilead, even in the country where it was collected, was\r\nvalued at double its weight in silver.[654] There were, however,\r\ninferior kinds of perfume, some of which were cheap enough, since we\r\nfind that an alabaster boxful, brought from the East, sometimes sold for\r\ntwo drachmas.[655]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 638:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 33. xii. 78. xiv. 50.

From Lydia was imported the\r\nBrenthion,[672] and from Babylonia the Nardon, which disputed the prize\r\nwith the royal unguent. There was among the Egyptians a perfume called\r\nCyphi,[673] entirely appropriated to the use of the gods, into the\r\ncomposition of which entered the following ingredients; the cyperus, a\r\nquantity of juniper-berries, raisins, odoriferous reeds and rushes, the\r\naspalathos, myrrh, wine, resin, and honey, mixed in certain proportions,\r\nand reduced to a fine paste.

Ouy quelquefois à en mourir.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOne sort of rouge[681] appears to have been obtained from a species of\r\nsea-moss or wrake,[682] which some have confounded with the\r\nanchusa,[683] though the grammarians enumerate them as things entirely\r\ndifferent. One of the commentators supposes the _purpurissa_ to be\r\nmeant, by which the Romans understood a sort of cheek-varnish,\r\nvermilion, or Spanish paint. There was in use a pigment for the\r\neyebrows, called Hypogramma,[684] and the edges of the eyelids were\r\ntinged black with Stimmis,[685] an oxyde of antimony, which still\r\nconstitutes one of the articles of the female toilette in the East.\r\nSometimes the eyebrows were blackened with resin soot,[686] and the\r\neyelashes caused to lie regularly by naphtha,[687] and a sort of paste\r\ncomposed of glue and pounded marble.[688] Another curious cosmetic was,\r\nthe Adarces,[689] a substance resembling congealed froth, found on reeds\r\nand the dry stalks of plants about the ponds and marshes of Cappadocia.\r\nIt was said to remove freckles, and enjoyed, likewise, great credit in\r\nmedicine. A preparation composed of the flour of turnip-seed, lupines,\r\nwheat, darnel, and chick-peas, was used for clearing the skin; so,\r\nlikewise, were the Chian and Selinusian earths,[690] which removed\r\nwrinkles, and rendered the skin smooth and shining. They were in\r\nconstant use in the baths. Cassia,[691] honey,[692] pepper,[693] and\r\nmyrrh,[694] cured pimples and effaced spots; fenugreek[695] whitened the\r\nhands and removed sunburns; briony,[696] isinglass,[697] costos,[698]\r\ngalbanum,[699] lupines, rainwater,[700] radishes,[701] and hare’s\r\nblood,[702] the biscutella didyma,[703] truffles,[704] cinnamon,[705]\r\nlinseed,[706] ladanum,[707] iris-roots,[708] white hellebore,[709]\r\nSardinian honey,[710] onion-juice,[711] and spring-wheat, moistened with\r\noxymel,[712] were among the principal preparations for removing moles\r\nand freckles, and beautifying the skin. In some parts of Greece\r\nelm-juice,[713] expressed at the first putting forth of the leaves in\r\nspring, was employed to give clearness and resplendency to the\r\ncomplexion. Almond-paste,[714] also, with the roots of the bitter\r\nalmond-tree, effaced spots from the skin. Others, for the same purpose,\r\nmade use of the berries of the wild-vine,[715] and a paste was prepared\r\nfrom lilies which induced fairness, and rendered the face smooth and\r\nshining.[716] To protect the complexion from the sun, the whole\r\ncountenance was varnished, as it were, with white of egg;[717] and some\r\nwomen, possibly rustics, used goose and hen’s grease as a cosmetic.[718]\r\nThe roots of the spikenard, when imported from the East, usually\r\nretained about them a little of the soil in which the plant had\r\ngrown:[719] this was carefully rubbed off, and having been passed\r\nthrough a fine sieve, was used for washing the hands, as it probably\r\nretained something of the fragrance of the plant. Rose leaves, reduced\r\nto powder, were sprinkled over persons as they issued from the bath,\r\nparticularly about the eyes, to heighten the freshness of the face.[720]\r\nTo communicate additional sweetness to their persons, Greek ladies\r\nsometimes wore about their necks carcanets of rose pastilles[721]\r\ninstead of jewelled necklaces, into the composition of which, however,\r\nseveral other ingredients entered, as nard, myrrh, costos, Illyrian\r\niris, honey, and Chian wine.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 676:\r\n\r\n  Poll. v. 102.\r\n\r\n              Μὴ τοίνων τὸ πρόσωπον ἅπαν ψιμύθῳ κατάπλαττε,\r\n              Ὥστε προσοπεῖον, κ’ οὐχι πρόσωπον ἔχειν.\r\n                                      Anthol.

In their shops scandal was fabricated, and news, good and\r\nbad, put into circulation. It was at a barber’s in the Peiræeus that\r\nsome stranger first disclosed the intelligence of the defeat in Sicily,\r\nthereby bringing the longue-tongued shaver into the greatest trouble;\r\nfor as he straightway ran up to the city and gave vent to the evil\r\ntidings, he was apprehended and put to the torture, in order to discover\r\nthe real author of what was supposed to be an atrocious\r\nfabrication.[732] But that which sometimes thus brought them into\r\nstraits, proved most commonly a source of profit, since to hear their\r\nlaughable stories and anecdotes many more persons congregated under\r\ntheir roofs than stood in need of new wigs or curling-irons,[733] and\r\nprobably got shaved by way of compliment to the master of the house.\r\nSuch of them as were remarkably unskilful sought to make up for their\r\nawkwardness[734] by the number and elegance of their razors, and the\r\nlarge size of their mirrors.[735] But it was not, we are told,\r\nunfrequent for men to get shaved by some humble practitioner,[736] with\r\none razor and a cunning hand, and afterwards to lounge into the more\r\ndashing shops, to put their curls in order before the large mirrors\r\nwhich adorned the walls.[737]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 732:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

While the\r\nbeard[740] was worn, their principal occupation must have been the\r\nclipping, curling, and perfuming of it; but afterwards when persons\r\nshaved in order to appear young,[741] and had learned to cover their\r\nbald pates with wigs,[742] their business grew to be much the same as it\r\nis at present. Their arts were necessarily in great request among the\r\nladies, for whom they contrived false eyebrows,[743] and innumerable\r\ndyes for giving whatever colour they desired to the hair, rendering it\r\nluxuriant and preventing it from turning grey. Hog’s lard and even\r\nbear’s grease mixed with powder of burnt filberts[744] were then in\r\ngreat request for strengthening and restoring the hair, together with\r\nonion-juice,[745] olives steeped in wine,[746] myrrh,[747] wild-olive\r\noil[748] mingled with water, according to Aristotle,[749] the glutinous\r\nhumour of snails obtained by passing a needle through them, and\r\nimmediately applied to the roots of the hair,[750] a bruized\r\ncabbage-leaf,[751] a hare’s head reduced to ashes,[752] the ashes of the\r\nasphodel-root,[753] burnt frogs,[754] and goat’s hoof,[755] Naxian\r\nstone,[756] halcyonion,[757] burnt walnuts,[758] and oil of pitch.[759]\r\nThe soot of pitch restored fallen eyelashes.[760] Among the depilatory\r\npreparations[761] used by ancient barbers may be enumerated the\r\nfumitory,[762] the scolopendra thalassia,[763] oak-fern,[764] juice of\r\nvine-leaves,[765] orpiment,[766] flour of salt,[767] sea-froth,[768] and\r\nthe blood of the chamelion.[769]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 738:\r\n\r\n  Zoëga, Bassi Rilievi. ii. 239.\r\n\r\nFootnote 739:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

The same effect was produced by a decoction of lotus\r\nstems,[772] or of the herb lycion.[773] As black hair, however, obtained\r\nthe preference of the majority, partly[774] perhaps because it better\r\nsuited their complexions, the number of recipes for giving it that hue\r\nis very great. Among the most remarkable substances employed for this\r\npurpose we may mention the ampelitis,[775] a black earth imported from\r\nSeleucia, in Syria, and the sory,[776] a mineral found chiefly in Egypt.\r\nTo these may be added decoctions of wood-blade,[777] myrtle, and\r\nmyrtle-berries,[778] ivy,[779] and dwarf-elder berries,[780] sage,[781]\r\nmulberries,[782] and palm-spathæ,[783] as also cypress cones, boiled in\r\nvinegar.[784] There prevailed an opinion in Italy[785] that the birds\r\nwhich fed on the berries of the smilax or yew-tree became black, though\r\nwe do not find, that the barbers had thought of introducing them among\r\nthe hair dyes.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 770:\r\n\r\n  Poll. v. 102. ii. 37.

In these cases the workmanship was very frequently so\r\nelaborate and exquisite as to be still more costly than the materials.\r\nEntire landscapes, including innumerable figures and objects were\r\nsometimes represented on the swell of a vase or goblet: Bacchanalian\r\nprocessions, for example, with whole troops of satyrs and mænades moving\r\nalong some wooded valley, or desert mountain, or rocky shore, at the\r\nheels of the Seileni and Dionysos, groups of nereids, nymphs, and\r\ntritons, sporting in the warm sunshine, on the unruffled expanse of\r\nocean; and sacrifices, marriages, chariot-races, and chorusses of youths\r\nand virgins, moving through the mazes of the dance, around the altar of\r\nApollo or Artemis. It is also to Hellenic goldsmiths that we are\r\nevidently to attribute those marvellous productions of art reckoned\r\namong the most boasted possessions of the Persian kings, such as that\r\nvine of gold,[797] with its vast grape clusters, imitated both in size\r\nand colour by the most precious gems, which formed a canopy over the\r\nroyal couch, or that golden platane-tree[798] and other vine, which,\r\nrising from behind the throne, stretched its branches, tendrils, and\r\nleaves of gold aloft over the monarch as he sat in state to give\r\naudience to his people. Here the bunches of grapes in various stages of\r\nripeness were represented by emeralds, Indian carbuncles, and other\r\nprecious stones of the richest and most dazzling hues. These things we\r\nknow were not the works of Persians, having been presented to Darius by\r\nPythios, the Lydian, who, doubtless, caused them to be fashioned by\r\nGrecian artists. What may have been the exact dimensions of this\r\nplatane-tree we know not; but, no doubt, Antiochos took an orator’s\r\nlicence, when, in an assembly of the Arcadians, he described it as too\r\ndiminutive to afford shelter to a grasshopper.[799]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 795:\r\n\r\n  Athen. ix. 75.

For it is not\r\ntrue, as Lucian pretends, that the Hellenic gods and goddesses were\r\ncontented to shroud their beauty in marble, bronze, or ivory, while\r\nMithras exhibited his rude visage, and Anubis his dog’s snout, in\r\ngold.[801] Even private individuals had statues erected to them of this\r\nprecious metal; and there were not wanting those who, like Gorgias, at\r\ntheir own expense did the same honour to themselves.[802]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 800:\r\n\r\n  Poll. viii. 86.\r\n\r\nFootnote 801:\r\n\r\n  Lucian.

But from a passage in the Phædros, it\r\n  may be inferred, that the practice prevailed as described in the text:\r\n  Καὶ σοὶ ἐγώ, ὥσπερ οἱ ἐννέα ἄρχοντες, ὑπισχνοῦμαι χρυσῆν εἰκόνα\r\n  ἰσομέτρητον εἰς Δελφοὺς ἀναθήσειν, οὐ μόνον ἐμαυτοῦ ἀλλὰ καὶ σήν.\r\n  Plat. Opp. t. i. p. 19.\r\n\r\nBut the variety of articles thus composed of the precious metals was so\r\ngreat as almost to defy description.[803] There were candelabra,[804]\r\nthrones,[805] and chairs, shields,[806] basins and ewers,[807] flagons,\r\ncensers, goblets in form of walnut-shells, ladles,[808] spoons,\r\nvinegar-saucers,[809] with almost every other article of the table.\r\nCrowns, likewise, for the heads of statues of princes, and successful\r\ngenerals, and other individuals whom the public desired to honour; with\r\nbread[810] and work baskets probably in filigree, clasps,[811] and\r\nspindles[812] for ladies, with armlets, anklets, bracelets, rings,\r\nnecklaces of carbuncles,[813] earrings,[814] and circlets for the head.\r\nThat these articles were usually formed with much taste and elegance we\r\nmay infer from the fact, that artists of the greatest respectability\r\nwere employed to make designs for them, while even the engravers of cups\r\nand goblets, as Mys, for example, sometimes acquired great\r\ncelebrity.[815]\r\n\r\nFootnote 803:\r\n\r\n  Among the Athenian chasers in metal Lycios obtained celebrity.\r\n  Demosth. adv.

Statues\r\nin Attica were commonly lacquered with gold;[816] and, from the remotest\r\nantiquity, the art of gilding appears to have flourished in Greece,\r\nsince we find mention of it in Homer, who speaks of gilding[817] the\r\nhorns of victims offered up to the gods. The ancients, unquestionably,\r\nemployed much thicker gold leaf in this process than the moderns; from\r\nwhich it has been inferred, that they were incapable of reducing it to\r\ngreater tenuity. But, besides that, when the leaves were too thin, the\r\nquicksilver which they employed as a glue appeared through, and dimmed\r\nthe splendour of the gold, they seem to have aimed at that very duration\r\nwhich causes us to admire the fragments of their gilding that still\r\nexist:—in the subterraneous chambers, for example, of the Villa Borghese\r\non the Palatine hill, where the figures in gold scattered over a ground\r\nof celestial blue, look as fresh as if just laid on.[818] Metals of all\r\nkinds were likewise gilt—as copper, and silver, and bronze. In gilding\r\nmarble the leaf was attached to the stone with white of egg, which was\r\nlikewise employed, instead of quicksilver, by dishonest workmen, who\r\ncould thus make use of a much thinner leaf.[819] The moderns in gilding\r\nmarble substitute the juice of garlic and figs. The practice of gilding\r\nwood and leather was also common in antiquity, as we find mention of\r\ngilt wooden statues and beads,[820] and harness, and sandal-thongs. The\r\nwalls and roofs of chambers were covered, moreover, with gilding, and\r\nthis ornament was laid as well on wainscot as stucco.[821] The\r\nconjecture of a modern writer,[822] that the ancients were acquainted\r\nwith the art of gilding in ormolu seems to be unfounded.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 816:\r\n\r\n  That is if Pollux has been rightly interpreted, ii. 214. vii. 163,\r\n  with the notes of the commentators, t. iv. p. 486. t. v. p. 472.\r\n\r\nFootnote 817:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. γ. 437, seq.

They accordingly had them\r\nof every form and material. Some persons, for example, wore a plain\r\ngold, or silver, or even iron, hoop; others a silver ring encircled by a\r\nnarrow band of gold, or a gold ring with a band of silver, or an iron\r\nring inlaid with gold.[824] Some persons were satisfied with a bronze\r\nring, or one of gilt iron,[825] which they wore apparently in memory of\r\nPrometheus, who, to preserve Zeus’ word unbroken, was fabled to bear on\r\nhis finger an iron ring set with a piece of Caucasian stone as a signet,\r\nso that, by a divine sort of quibble, he might for ever be said to be\r\nchained to Caucasus.[826] Others, again, delighted in rings of\r\namber,[827] white or yellow, or ivory, or porcelain, at least these were\r\nfashionable in Egypt. Sometimes, they wore silver rings with signets of\r\ngold, or the contrary. Mention, too, is made of a ring formed entirely\r\nof carnelian, which, to preserve it, was encircled by a narrow hoop of\r\nsilver, and set with a golden signet.[828]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 823:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

Next to the above was\r\nthe carnelian[839] of a deep ensanguined hue, chiefly obtained from the\r\nisland of Sardinia: the jasper of a dark green, with spots of many\r\ncolours, the sapphire blue bespangled with gold.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 831:\r\n\r\n  Treasurer’s ring.

All emeralds, however, are not of one hue, but\r\nexhibit every possible shade of green, from the dusky tint of the olive\r\nleaf to the pale verdure of the acacia.[842] The Greek jewellers appear\r\nto have judged of the genuineness of this stone by plunging it into\r\nclear water: for if it were a true emerald it would, they thought,\r\nimpart its colour to the whole of the surrounding element; if not, a\r\nsmall part only of it would be tinged.[843]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 840:\r\n\r\n  Plin. xxxvii. 16.

It may\r\nbe observed, that much pains and labour were expended in bringing the\r\nemerald to its lustre.[846]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 844:\r\n\r\n  Id. § 24.

It appears certain,\r\nhowever, that they polished precious stones with emery,[851] and\r\npossessed the lapidary’s wheel, with all the finer tools at present in\r\nuse, including the diamond point,[852] which there is reason to believe\r\nthey likewise fixed on the wheel.[853] At any rate, they contrived with\r\nthe instruments they possessed to engrave figures, as of lions, heroes,\r\nbacchantes, caryatides, trophies,[854] both in relief and intaglio,\r\nwhich for beauty and delicacy have never yet been equalled. It was at\r\none time a question whether or not they were acquainted with the\r\nmicroscope,[855]—though how they could engrave without it figures which\r\nwe require its assistance distinctly to perceive, seems somewhat\r\ndifficult to comprehend. The gem, for example, called the seal of\r\nMichael Angelo, in the French king’s cabinet, though it does not exceed\r\nhalf an inch in diameter, contains fifteen figures most elaborately\r\nwrought.[856] A private gentleman at Rome possessed a wolf’s tooth on\r\nwhich was a representation of the twelve gods.[857] Cicero commemorates\r\nan individual who had written the whole Iliad in characters so minute\r\nand in so small a compass, that it could be contained in a\r\nwalnut-shell.[858] Myrmecides, the Milesian, and Callicrates, the\r\nLacedæmonian, manufactured ivory chariots so small, that they could be\r\ncovered with the wing of a fly; and wrote two verses in gold letters on\r\na grain of sesame.[859]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 851:\r\n\r\n  Σμύρις λίθος ἐστιν, ᾗ τὰς ψήφους οἱ δακτυλιογλύφοι σμήχουσι.

The same or a\r\nsimilar process was known to the ancients, and might still, perhaps, be\r\neasily recovered were it any longer an object to be desired. The Greeks\r\nalways retained a strong partiality for articles of brass, copper, and\r\nbronze, and besides statues,[865] pillars,[866] and trees, where the\r\nfruit was sometimes of gold,[867] employed them in cups, urns, vases,\r\nand caldrons, with covers of the same metal.[868] We also find mention\r\nmade of brazen mangers, and even maps.[869]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 863:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

To guard against this\r\neffect the superior and more delicate articles were, in later times,\r\ncooled not in water but in oil.[875] The Spartans, we are told, quenched\r\ntheir iron money in vinegar which rendered it, they supposed, brittle\r\nand unmalleable, consequently of no value but as a token.[876]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 872:\r\n\r\n  Palæphat.

Aristotle, in\r\ndescribing the process of smelting, observes, that steel, in passing\r\nthrough the furnace, not only diminishes in quantity but in specific\r\ngravity also, that is to say, becomes less valuable. It was one merit of\r\nthe Chalybean steel that it was not liable to rust. The method of\r\npreparing this metal which prevailed among the Celtiberians was\r\nthis:[878] they buried a number of iron plates in the earth, where they\r\nsuffered them to remain until the greater portion was converted into\r\nrust.[879] They then drew them forth and wrought them into various kinds\r\nof weapons, particularly swordblades, which were so keen that neither\r\nshields, nor helmets, nor sculls, were able to resist their edge. To\r\nthis the complimentary Plutarch likens the language of the\r\nSpartans.[880]\r\n\r\nFootnote 877:\r\n\r\n  Justin. xliv. 4.

By these the river of\r\nthe Chalybeans was thought to be distinguished,[881] as well as the\r\nwaters near Como, at Calatayud and Tarragona in Spain. Water has,\r\nlikewise, been prepared, by a variety of infusions, for communicating a\r\nfiner temper and greater hardness to steel, an example of which is\r\nmentioned in the history of the Duke Cosmo, who invented, according to\r\nVasari,[882] a liquid wherein were hardened the tools with which\r\nFrancesco del Tadda was enabled to cut a fountain-basin, and several\r\nother articles, from a block of the hardest porphyry. Nothing, however,\r\nwas more common than this operation among the ancients, both Greeks and\r\nEgyptians, by whom porphyry was cut into every variety of form, and\r\ninvested with the highest polish.[883]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 881:\r\n\r\n  Plin. xxxiv. 41.\r\n\r\nFootnote 882:\r\n\r\n  Vit. de Pitt.

That which came from Sinope\r\nand the Chalybes served for the manufacture of ordinary tools; the\r\nLaconian[885] was wrought into files, augers, chisels, and the other\r\nimplements of stone-cutters; the Lydian stood in high estimation with\r\nthe sword-cutlers, and the manufacturers of razors and surgical\r\ninstruments.[886] The locks and keys[887] of the ancients, if we may\r\njudge from the specimens found at Pompeii, were of a somewhat rude\r\nconstruction, though probably manufactured of the best iron.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 884:\r\n\r\n  Plin. xxxiv. 41.\r\n\r\nFootnote 885:\r\n\r\n  Eustath. ad Il. β. p. 222.

In this branch of industry the Delphians would seem to have\r\nobtained celebrity, though the form and uses of their knives, alluded to\r\nin a comparison by Aristotle,[889] can be looked upon only as matter of\r\nconjecture. It seems to me, that, like Hudibras’ dagger, they would\r\nserve for a variety of purposes, as a poignard for example, as a\r\nsacrificial instrument, and as a common knife:\r\n\r\n                When it had stabbed, or broke a head,\r\n                It would scrape trenchers or chip bread,\r\n                Toast cheese or bacon, though it were\r\n                To bait a mousetrap ’twould not care.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 889:\r\n\r\n  Polit. i. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere was a very elegant sort of knives among the Athenians, adorned\r\nwith ivory handles, delicately carved with the figures of animals, among\r\nwhich was that of a crouching lioness.[890] For this purpose the ivory\r\nwas frequently stained of different colours, as pink, or crimson, or\r\npurple, according to the fancy of the workman. Knife-handles were\r\nsometimes also made of the roots of the lotos,[891] which, no doubt,\r\ntook a fine polish and were beautifully clouded. Their scissors,\r\nbodkins, sailmakers’ needles, common needles, pins,[892] and other\r\narticles of this description, would seem to have been manufactured with\r\nmuch neatness.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 890:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

Many, probably, of the useful arts owed much of the\r\nprogress they made to the passion of the Greeks for arms, which led them\r\nindustriously to study and invent whatever could add to their splendour\r\nor efficiency. We need not now go back to the times when sticks and\r\nstones and pointed reeds formed the national weapons.[894] Among the\r\nvery first steps in civilisation were improvements in the art of\r\nself-defence; for, wherever men have found it necessary to create\r\nproperty, they have felt it to be equally so to invent weapons for\r\nprotecting themselves in the enjoyment of it. Accordingly the Greeks,\r\nlong before the birth of history, had surrounded themselves by numerous\r\ninstruments of destruction, and learned to cover their bodies with\r\narmour infinitely varied in materials and workmanship.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 893:\r\n\r\n  See an elegant representation of a columnar anvil which we may infer\r\n  was used by armourers. Gemme Antiche, Figurate di Leonardo Agostini,\r\n  pt. ii. tav. 36.\r\n\r\nFootnote 894:\r\n\r\n  Goguet. i. 165.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUpon none of their weapons, however, did they bestow greater attention\r\nthan on the sword, which if it did not, as among certain barbarians,\r\nconstitute one of the objects of their worship,[895] was in most cases\r\ntheir inseparable companion through life, and descended with them even\r\nto the grave. Thus we find, that, when Cimon opened, at Scyros, the\r\ngrave of Theseus, the national hero of Attica, he found beside the\r\nskeleton a spearhead and sword of brass.[896] Their blades were of many\r\ndifferent shapes and dimensions: they had the long, sharp, double-edged\r\nrapier; the short cut and thrust; the crooked scimitar, the sabre, and\r\nthe broad-sword.[897] These were generally of the finest steel, highly\r\npolished, and sometimes damaskened exactly like those blades afterwards\r\nmanufactured at Damascus. The sheath was sometimes of ivory, sometimes\r\nof gold or silver or tin or other inferior metal.[898] To the\r\nfirst-mentioned substance we have an allusion in a saying of Diogenes,\r\nwho on hearing a handsome young man make use of low language, exclaimed:\r\n“How shameless! to draw forth a sword of lead from a sheath of\r\nivory.”[899] The hilts were often extremely superb, of costly materials,\r\nand wrought in the most fanciful shapes. We read, for example, of\r\nsword-handles studded or inlaid with gold, or even composed entirely of\r\nthat metal, or of silver.[900] Ivory too, and amber,[901] and\r\nterebinth,[902] polished and black as ebony, and a variety of other\r\nwoods and substances, stained black with nut-gall,[903] were employed\r\nfor this purpose. The father of Demosthenes, who kept a large\r\nmanufactory of arms, left behind him a considerable quantity of ivory\r\nand gall-nuts[904] which he had purchased as well for his own use as to\r\nsupply other armourers in a smaller way. Of daggers there were various\r\nkinds, some of a larger size, worn suspended on the thigh with the\r\nsword, as the hunting knife was by the Persian youth; others much\r\nsmaller, which seem to have been carried about concealed under the\r\narmpit, as is still the fashion in the East. To this practice Socrates\r\nalludes in his conversation with Polos of Agrigentum,[905] on the power\r\npossessed in states by tyrants, whom he compares to one who should go\r\nforth into the marketplace with an enchiridion concealed about him, and\r\nfor that reason fancy it in his power to take away every man’s life,\r\nbecause he could undoubtedly kill any one he pleased.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 895:\r\n\r\n  Thus, speaking of the Alani, Ammianus Marcellinus relates: Nec templum\r\n  apud eos visitur, aut delubrum ne tugurium quidem culmo tectum cerni\r\n  usquam potest: sed gladius barbarico ritu humi figitur nudus, eúmque\r\n  ut Martem, regionum quas circumcircant præsulem verecundiùs colunt. l.\r\n  xxxi. c. 2. p. 673.

These javelins, in more modern times, were furnished with a\r\nlooped thong, by which when the darter had missed his aim, they could be\r\ndrawn back.[909] The best kind were supposed to be manufactured in\r\nBœotia. Spear-shafts were likewise sometimes of ash,[910] but more\r\nfrequently of cornel wood,[911] and occasionally, as in the case of the\r\nMacedonian sarissa, eighteen feet long. Like the javelin, the spear also\r\nwas shod sharp with iron, in order the more easily to be fixed upright\r\nin the earth, when soldiers slept abroad in the fields.[912] This part\r\nof the iron-work, which was hollow and received the shaft into it, is\r\nsaid to have been shaped like a lizard, doubtless represented as holding\r\nthe point of the handle in its mouth. Projections resembling legs\r\nextended on both sides, designed to prevent the spear from sinking too\r\ndeep into the ground. In the lances of the cavalry there was, as some\r\nsuppose, a small notch to receive the point of the horseman’s foot when\r\nmounting his steed. The spear-head, generally of iron or steel, was\r\namong the Arab allies of Xerxes formed of goat’s horn, fashioned like\r\nthe iron of a lance.[913]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 906:\r\n\r\n  Poll. i. 143.\r\n\r\nFootnote 907:\r\n\r\n  Spearheads were sometimes poisoned with the juice of the dorycnion.\r\n  Plin. xxi. 81.\r\n\r\nFootnote 908:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

Among the barbarous\r\nnations there were those who manufactured them of cane or palm-branches,\r\nor even of the long stem of the date.[915] The bowstring was of thong or\r\nhorse-hair. Reeds generally constituted the shafts of their arrows,[916]\r\nwhich were headed with iron or copper, or hard pointed stones, as those\r\nof the Arabs in the army of Xerxes, who employed for this purpose the\r\nsame stones wherewith they engraved their seals.[917] Arrows were\r\nfrequently winged with eagles’ feathers, and tinged at the point with\r\npoison.[918] In sieges they were often armed with fire.[919]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 914:\r\n\r\n  On the Scythian bow, see Plat. de Legg. t. viii. p. 15; on the Cretan,\r\n  Poll. i. 45. 149; on arrows, Athen. x. 18.\r\n\r\nFootnote 915:\r\n\r\n  Poll. i. 244.

His\r\n  people obeyed the order; and when he had satisfied himself respecting\r\n  their number, he ordered a huge vessel to be cast with the bronze,\r\n  which, in the age of the Father of History, still existed at a place\r\n  called Exampæos, between the Borysthenes and the Hypanis.

Their\r\nhelmets, cuirasses, shields, cuisses, and greaves, were made of polished\r\nsteel, or brass, or tin, sometimes curiously figured, and inlaid with\r\nmetals of many different colours, and polished to an exceeding\r\nbrightness,[922] sometimes adorned with representations in relief.\r\nFrequently they went cased in shirts of mail, composed of innumerable\r\nsmall metallic plates, lapping over each other so as to resemble the\r\nscales of fishes. Occasionally the opulent appeared on the field of\r\nbattle in golden armour,[923] though this piece of ostentation was\r\nchiefly confined to the barbarians.[924] The armourers’ craft, however,\r\nseems to have gone on improving in proportion as the courage of the\r\nnation deteriorated, until at length, in Macedonian times, armour of\r\nenormous weight, and, literally, impenetrable, came into use. Thus\r\nZoilos manufactured for Demetrios Poliorcetes two coats-of-mail,[925] of\r\na steel so hard, that the surface could scarcely be grazed by an arrow\r\ndischarged from a catapult. The whole suit weighed no less than one\r\nhundred and thirty pounds, exactly twice as much as an ordinary suit of\r\narmour.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 922:\r\n\r\n  Herod. ix. 21. i. 15.\r\n\r\nFootnote 923:\r\n\r\n  Id. i. 215.\r\n\r\nFootnote 924:\r\n\r\n  On one occasion we find the magistrates of Thessaly coming forth with\r\n  panoply of gold to meet the ashes of Pelopidas.

Plut. Pelopid. § 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 925:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Demet. § 21.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHelmets[926] were manufactured of numerous materials. First, in the\r\nruder ages, they were in reality nothing more than so many close\r\nskull-caps made of the skins[927] of otters or water-dogs, with the hair\r\non,[928] or foxes, or weasels, or goats, or bulls, or lions. But as the\r\narts of civilisation improved, metal casques were soon substituted for\r\nthese primitive defences, some of which, of wrought steel, were highly\r\npolished, and shone like burnished silver. That of Alexander was\r\nmanufactured by Theophilos.[929] The helmet consisted of a variety of\r\nparts: as, first, the casque itself, inlaid with brass and iron,[930]\r\nwhich enclosed and defended the head, the front brim projecting over the\r\nforehead; the vizor, which dropped over the whole face; the strap, often\r\nrichly embroidered or studded with jewels,[931] passing under the chin;\r\nand the ridge, or cone, on the summit, from which rose the plumes, or\r\ncrest.[932] This crest, double, treble, or even quadruple, according to\r\nthe taste or fancy of the wearer, sometimes consisted of long drooping\r\nostrich feathers,[933] sometimes of horse-hair, either black or dyed of\r\ndifferent colours, which, trembling and floating over the warrior’s\r\nhead, appeared to augment his stature while it added to the terror of\r\nhis aspect. King Pyrrhos, we are told, wore upon his helmet the horns of\r\na goat, symbolical of the power of Macedon;[934] and the Asiatic\r\nThracians flanked their crests with the horns and ears of an ox in\r\nbrass.[935] To break the force of blows from clubs or heavy battle-axes,\r\nthe crown of the helmet was thickly lined with sponge or soft wool.[936]\r\nMention is likewise made of helmets of plaited cord of wood and\r\nleather,[937] and the skins of horses’ heads, retaining the ears and the\r\nmane.[938]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 926:\r\n\r\n  Poll. i. 148, seq.

The former were generally composed of linen or\r\nhempen twine curiously wrought, and doubled or trebled according to the\r\ndesire of the purchaser,[940] and worn chiefly in the chase;[941] others\r\nconsisted of thick leathern jerkins, covered with metallic scales,[942]\r\nsingle, double, or treble, and fastened to each other by a series of\r\nhooks. In lieu of these plates was sometimes substituted a coating of\r\nintertwisted rings, resembling in some respects the chain armour of a\r\nlater age. Wooden cuirasses were also sometimes worn.[943] The\r\nSarmatians[944] possessing no iron, headed their darts and javelins with\r\nbone, and employed very extraordinary materials in the manufacture of\r\ntheir cuirasses. Collecting carefully all the hoofs of such horses as\r\ndied, they cut them into laminæ, resembling in form the scales of a\r\nfish. These they sewed together with the nerves of horses or oxen, and\r\nthus produced a species of breastplate which for elegance and utility\r\nwas scarcely inferior to those of the Greeks. In the manufacture of\r\nlinen corslets[945] the Egyptians displayed peculiar excellence, at\r\nleast the description of one of them which history has preserved is\r\ncalculated to create a very high idea of their ingenuity. It was\r\ncuriously wrought, we are told, with fine bobbins, each composed of\r\nthree hundred and sixty threads, distinctly visible, adorned with\r\nnumerous figures of animals interwoven with cotton and gold.[946] Among\r\nthe Greeks this piece of armour was often richly embroidered by the\r\nladies of the warrior’s family, whom, on more than one occasion, we find\r\nbusy at this task on the eve of battle. The cuirasses of brass or steel\r\nwere finely polished and buttoned under the arm. Even the horses were\r\nfurnished with breastplates and frontlets,[947] and occasionally their\r\nflanks also were protected by armour. The warrior’s greaves[948] were\r\nmanufactured of copper, brass, tin, or other metal, and fastened about\r\nthe legs with silver buttons. Archers seem commonly to have worn a\r\nspecies of gloves or fingerlings.[949]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 939:\r\n\r\n  Poll. i. 148, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 940:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Lexic. v. χειρίδες.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of shields[950] underwent great fluctuations at\r\ndifferent periods of Grecian history, and even in the same age there\r\nexisted numerous and extraordinary differences in their materials, form,\r\nand structure. In early times they consisted simply of a piece of\r\ncircular basket-work, plaited for the sake of lightness with\r\nvine-branches[951] or willows; or were made of a solid piece of wood\r\nscooped into the proper form, and covered with one or more coats of\r\nleather. The wood usually preferred for this use was that of the elder,\r\nthe beach, the poplar, and the fig; and the leather was generally tough\r\nbull-hide,[952] with or without the hair, though we read of nations, as\r\nthe Ethiopians, who made use for this purpose of the skins of\r\ncranes.[953] The same people at the present day have discovered that the\r\nhide of the crocodile, dressed with the scales on, forms a better\r\nintegument for their bucklers. Among the Homeric heroes the wooden\r\nframework was protected by many folds of leather, amounting sometimes to\r\nseven, to which were added plates of brass, silver, gold, or tin. Even\r\nwhen the face of the shield was composed of some inferior metal, the rim\r\nseems frequently to have been of gold.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 950:\r\n\r\n  Poll. i. 148, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 951:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

Occasionally, likewise, they were inlaid with purple, ivory, and\r\ngold,[954] or painted white, or crusted with gold and silver, as among\r\nthe Samnites.[955] From the remotest antiquity, moreover, it was\r\ncustomary to paint upon shields a number of devices, each warrior\r\nselecting one for himself,[956] which, like the armorial bearings of the\r\nknights of chivalry, distinguished him from his comrades in battle. Thus\r\nPerseus chose the head of the Gorgon Medusa;[957] Tydeus the aspect of\r\nthe face of the mighty heavens, including the full moon, surrounded by\r\nflaming stars;[958] Eteocles bore before him the figure of a warrior\r\nscaling a lofty tower, while Hippomedon selected, as the emblem of his\r\ncharacter, the figure of Typhœos breathing forth fire and smoke. Every\r\nreader will remember the varied imagery that crowded the shield of the\r\nHomeric Achilles, together with the scenes which Hesiod, in imitation,\r\ndepicts on the buckler of Heracles. In the historical period[959] the\r\npeople of Sicyon had a sigma, the initial letter in the name of their\r\ncapital, painted on their shields.[960] These ornaments, as well as the\r\nhandles, it is said, owed their origin to the invention of the Carians.\r\nThe form of the shield exhibited much variety. One kind, for example,\r\nwas small and circular,[961] another oblong or parallelogrammatic, and\r\nof dimensions so large as to cover the whole body, and allow the fallen\r\nwarrior to be borne home on it as upon a bier; others were\r\nrhomboidal,[962] or semilunar, or shaped like an ivy-leaf. But whatever\r\nmay have been their figure, there always projected from the centre of\r\nthe external face a large boss, with a smaller one, generally pointed,\r\non the middle of it. This the soldiers dashed in the countenances of the\r\nenemy. Within, two bars, stretching from rim to rim, and crossing each\r\nother like the letter X, gave the warrior, who passed his left arm\r\nbehind them, greater power over his defence, while a smaller handle, on\r\nthe fore part of the shield, received his grasp.[963] Occasionally, the\r\nplace of these bars was supplied by metallic or wooden handles, exactly\r\nof a size to receive the arm; and, by means of a leathern strap, the\r\nbuckler, when marching, was usually suspended on the shoulder.[964] In\r\ntime of peace both the shield and the helmet were laid up, each in its\r\nappropriate case.[965] Besides the manufacturers of arms, who supplied\r\nstates with large orders, there were numerous armourers on a smaller\r\nscale,[966] whose shops exhibited a rich and varied assortment of\r\nshields, helmets, and every kind of weapon.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 954:\r\n\r\n  Poll. i. 134.\r\n\r\nFootnote 955:\r\n\r\n  Winkel.

We know, however, that, at\r\nLaurion,[968] the Athenians made use of both shafts and adits, and that\r\nin chambering they employed much timber.[969] To prevent the falling in\r\nof the superincumbent mountain there were left at intervals vast\r\npillars,[970] the cutting away of which was by law prohibited on pain of\r\ndeath. In the potter’s-clay mines of Samos, where the veins, running\r\ngenerally between beds of rock, were exceedingly shallow, seldom\r\nexceeding two feet in depth, the miners, as in the thin veins of our own\r\ncoal mines, were compelled while at work to lie on their back or sides,\r\nwhich, it may be presumed, was the practice in other mines under similar\r\ncircumstances. Whether they possessed any means of protecting themselves\r\nagainst the fire-damps or malaria,[971] which, we know, prevailed\r\ngreatly at Laurion,[972] is a matter of much uncertainty. In Spain, the\r\nmines ran deep into the earth, and were of prodigious extent, having\r\ntransverse passages and caverns of great dimensions and elevation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 967:\r\n\r\n  Plin.

In\r\nthem we find an almost exact type of the degrading toil and disregard of\r\ndanger and decency recently brought to light among our own subterranean\r\npopulation. There, indeed, the workmen were forced to their task by the\r\ndirect compulsion of a tyrannical government; while in Great Britain the\r\nconstraint is enveloped by a cloud of circumstances which conceal,\r\nthough they scarcely soften, the stern laws of necessity.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian gold mines were situated in the great eastern desert, on\r\nthe shores of the Red Sea. They had been worked from the remotest\r\nantiquity; in proof of which it is related, that copper pickaxes were\r\nfrequently found in the deserted shafts and galleries, beside incredible\r\nheaps of human bones, relics of the multitudes who had perished there by\r\nmalaria, or fire-damps, or the falling of rocks, or more probably from\r\nthe incessant oppression to which they were subjected.[976] In fact the\r\nbenevolent historian,[977] to whom we are indebted for nearly all we\r\nknow on this curious subject, felt so strongly for the sufferings of\r\nthese wretched artificers of Egyptian grandeur, that he pronounced death\r\nin their case to be more desirable than life.[978] But the most\r\nmiserable possess resources and springs of gratification unknown to\r\nphilosophers and the professors of literature; and, we may be sure, that\r\neven those outcasts who brought up gold from the bowels of the earth to\r\nadorn the thrones and palaces of the Pharaohs, knew how to extract from\r\ntheir bitter employment some few sweets of sufficient efficacy to render\r\nlife endurable.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 976:\r\n\r\n  The same excessive waste of human life has been observable in all\r\n  countries where mines have been worked on a large scale: “Juan\r\n  Gonzales de Alzevedo assuroit en 1609, que le nombre des indigènes\r\n  étoit diminué de moitié dans les environs des mines du Pérou, et d’un\r\n  tiers en d’autres endroits, depuis 1581.” Schneider, Observations sur\r\n  Ulloa, t. ii. p. 264.\r\n\r\nFootnote 977:\r\n\r\n  Agatharchid. ap. Phot. Biblioth. Cod. 250. p. 447. a. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 978:\r\n\r\n  Οὗτοι πάντες οἱ τὸν εἰρημένον τῆς τύχης κλῆρον ὑπελθόντες ποθεινότερον\r\n  ἔχουσι τοῦ βίου τὸν θάνατον. Id. p. 448. a. 38.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNo doubt the processes of those early times were sufficiently rude. When\r\nabout to open a new shaft or adit the Inspectors of the mines appear\r\ncarefully to have examined the different faces of the mountain, sombre,\r\nscarped, and barren to the last degree; and having fixed upon a spot in\r\nthe face of some cliff, the first operation was to render the rock\r\nfriable by the application of powerful fires, which were kindled with\r\nwood at its base. The more robust of the workmen then proceeded with\r\ntheir pickaxes to the excavation of the galleries, which seldom or never\r\nproceeded in a right line; but following the direction of the metallic\r\nveins, mounted, descended, branched off obliquely to the left or to the\r\nright; and progressing in this manner, sometimes perforated the whole\r\nbulk of the mountain, and striking downwards, like the roots of trees,\r\nextended even to the sea.[979] The men employed in _getting_ the ore,\r\nfollowed incessantly by task-masters with instruments of chastisement in\r\ntheir hands, were seldom permitted to proportion their exertions to\r\ntheir strength; but often toiled on apparently till they dropped, when\r\ntheir bones joined the heaps of those who had fallen before them. While\r\nthus engaged, more especially when united in great numbers they had\r\nclambered the rocks to a considerable height, they presented an\r\nextraordinary spectacle; for each miner[980] carried a lamp bound to his\r\nforehead, though how, when they bent or kneeled, or worked sideways, it\r\nescaped being extinguished seems difficult of explanation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 979:\r\n\r\n  Similar excavations in the mountain of Potosi are thus described by\r\n  Don Antonio d’Ulloa: “Le mont du Potosi doit être considéré comme\r\n  l’intérieur d’ une ruche à miel, vu le nombre des percemens, des\r\n  galeries, des fouilles qu’on y remarque. C’est ce qu’on se figurera\r\n  facilement, en se répresentant la quantité prodigieuse de matières\r\n  qu’on a tirées de son intérieur, pour obtener les minérais qui s’y\r\n  trouvent répandus partout, et desquels on extrait l’argent. S’il étoit\r\n  donc possible de le découvrir totalement de sa croûte externe, on y\r\n  appercevroit un nombre infini de routes souterreines percées sans\r\n  suite, et comme au hasard, selon la direction des veines métalliques.”\r\n  Mémoires Philosophiques, t. i. p. 289.\r\n\r\nFootnote 980:\r\n\r\n  Οὗτοι μὲν οὖν λύχνους προσδεδεμένους τοῖς μετώποις ἔχοντες λατομοῦσιν,\r\n  ἀκολουθοῦντες οἷον φλεβὶ τῷ λευκανθίζοντι. Phot. Bib. p. 448. a.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe laborious operation of collecting and _hurrying_ the ore was\r\nperformed by boys of tender age, who deposited it beyond the mouth of\r\nthe shaft. Another class of workmen, consisting chiefly of the aged and\r\nthe infirm, now bore the metalliferous stones to that part of the works\r\nwhere the founders were stationed. These were powerful and robust men in\r\nthe flower of their age, who, with large stone mortars and iron pestles,\r\nreduced, under the eye of rigid Inspectors, the ore to small fragments\r\nnot exceeding a vetch in size.[981] This done, it was transferred to the\r\nmills which were turned by women, the wives and daughters of the miners,\r\nwho, with the exception of a slender covering about the waist, were\r\nentirely naked, misery in all times and places rendering people\r\ncontemptuous of appearances and indifferent to morality.[982] These\r\nmills, heavy no doubt and difficult to work, were turned by six women,\r\nthree on either side. They would appear, however, to have answered well\r\nthe purpose for which they were designed, since the ore, we are told,\r\nwas reduced by them to the fineness of flour; after which it was handed\r\nover to the Selangeus, the last link in that long chain of operators\r\nwhich connected the mine with the smelting furnace. The business of the\r\nSelangeus consisted in separating the metal from the matrix in which it\r\nhad been produced. For this purpose, the auriferous dust was cast in a\r\nheap upon a broad polished board slightly inclined,[983] and there\r\nwashed and triturated until the greater part of the terrene particles\r\nhad been, by soft sponges and water, separated from the gold, which was\r\nnext put into earthen vessels with small quantities of lead, tin, salt,\r\nand barley-bran, and placed in the smelting furnace, where it was\r\nsubjected, for five days and nights, to the flames. This done, the\r\nvirgin gold came forth glittering and pure as if it had not been wrung\r\nfrom human agony or sullied by human tears.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 981:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Diod.

In\r\nthe iron mines the charcoal of the Eubœan walnut-tree was preferred for\r\nsecond smelting.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 984:\r\n\r\n  “That the Athenians made use of the bellows and of charcoal is not\r\n  improbable; the latter, indeed, may be fairly inferred from the\r\n  account of the charcoal-sellers, or rather charcoal-burners, from\r\n  which business a large portion of the Acharnians in particular\r\n  obtained their livelihood.” Dissertation on the Mines of Laurion.

The heap was then set on fire, and the covering pierced on all\r\nsides with spits, to provide a vent for the smoke. The fire having been\r\nkept burning for the proper time, which is not stated, the charcoal was\r\nremoved and laid by for use.[986] Extensive works of this kind were\r\nestablished at the borough of Acharnè, in Attica, which was supplied\r\nwith wood, chiefly the scarlet oak, from the forests on Mount\r\nParnes.[987]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 986:\r\n\r\n  Id. v. 9. 5. ix. 3. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 987:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Acharn. 302, 587. Diog. Laert. i. 8. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMuch stress was laid by Hellenic artificers on the materials from which\r\nthe charcoal was manufactured: thus smiths, braziers, and other\r\nhandicraftsmen preferred that of the pitch-pine to what was made from\r\nthe oak, because it exhibited a greater tractability to the bellows,\r\nkeeping up a more enduring flame, and being less liable to sudden\r\nextinction, though inferior in force. Generally, in fact, all dry woods\r\nfurnish a brisker and a brighter flame. Twigs and small branches, as the\r\nGreek philosophers had observed, yield, while burning, the fiercest\r\nheat; but it was supposed that they were too deficient in body to be\r\nprofitably converted into charcoal. In France, however, and other parts\r\nof the Continent, we find twigs no bigger than goose-quills used for\r\nthis purpose. Some kinds of wood, it was observed, produce in burning a\r\nfar greater quantity of smoke than others.[988] Of these are all such as\r\ndelight in humid situations, as the platane and the willow, with the\r\nblack and white poplar. The vine,[989] too, while moist, stands in the\r\nsame category, though it yield the palm to the date-palm, which enjoyed\r\namong the ancients the reputation of being the smokiest tree that\r\ngrows.[990] In sharpness, however, the smoke of the fig-tree was\r\nsupposed to excel, together with that of the wild fig-tree,[991] and\r\ngenerally all such natives of the forest as abound in a milky juice.\r\nNevertheless, having been barked, steeped in running-water, and dried\r\nagain,[992] these same kinds of wood were freer than all others from\r\nsmoke, and yielded the softest and purest flame.[993] The same thing is\r\nremarked of wood which had been washed with the lees of oil.[994]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 988:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

Plin. Nat. Hist. xxxvi.\r\n  21. On the incorruptibility of charcoal, St. Augustin, who loved to\r\n  declaim a little, thus writes:—“Quid? in carbonibus nonne miranda est,\r\n  et tanta infirmitas, ut ictu levissimo frangantur, pressu facillime\r\n  conterantur: et tanta firmitas ut nullo humore corrumpantur, nulla\r\n  ætate vincantur, usque adeo ut eos substernere soleant.... Quis eos in\r\n  terra humida effossos, ubi ligna putrescerent, tamdiu durare\r\n  incorruptibilior posse, nisi rerum ille corruptor ignis effecit?” De\r\n  Civitat. Dei, xxxi. 4. The charcoal was thus employed by the advice of\r\n  Theodoros, the son of Rhæcos, the Samian. Οὗτος ἐστιν ὁ συμβουλεύσας\r\n  ἄνθρακας ὑποτεθῆναι τοῖς θεμελίοις τοῦ ἐν Ἐφέσω νεώ.

This necessary piece of\r\nfurniture[1000] was most commonly manufactured of ivy, or laurel, or\r\nclematis, and was something of the rhamnus ilex, or linden-tree; in\r\nshort, of nearly all trees, except the olive. Generally, however, it was\r\nthought best to make the two parts of the instrument of different kinds\r\nof wood. It was observed that, with these contrivances, fire kindled\r\nmore readily during the prevalence of the north than the south wind, and\r\non high places than in hollows. At Rome the vestal virgins originated\r\nthe sacred fire by means of a kind of mirror, and the power of\r\nburning-glasses was not unknown.[1001] Nay, things resembling our\r\nlucifer matches were possessed by certain jugglers, though they do not\r\nappear to have passed into general use, either because the inventors\r\nrefused to divulge their secret, or from the natural slowness of mankind\r\nto profit by useful discoveries.[1002]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 999:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Repub. t. vi. p. 194.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1000:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

In many cases,\r\nhowever, as where cheapness or despatch was aimed at, bricks were\r\nsubstituted,[1005] made, in addition to the materials at present\r\nemployed, from powdered tufa.[1006]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1003:\r\n\r\n  Winkel.

A superior kind of cement was made from those stones used in the\r\nmanufacture of gypsum, which was so firm and durable, that it was\r\nfrequently found to outlast the materials which it had been employed to\r\nunite. It was prepared by being reduced to powder, and mixed with water,\r\nand afterwards well stirred with a piece of wood, since it was too hot\r\nto admit of the hands being used. When removed from old walls it might\r\nbe burnt and prepared a second and a third time, as originally from the\r\nstone.[1008] This, in Syria and Phœnicia, was used in facing the walls\r\nof houses, and in Italy for whitening them, as well as in the making of\r\nvarious mouldings and ornaments within.[1009]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1007:\r\n\r\n  On one occasion, moreover, when they happened to be in lack of hods,\r\n  they gave proof of no less ingenuity in their mode of carrying mortar.\r\n  In the hasty construction of the fortress of Pylos, by Demosthenes and\r\n  his companions, the soldiers took the mud, which was to serve as\r\n  cement, on their bare backs, stooping forward that it might not fall\r\n  off, and knotting their hands on their loins beneath their burden: καὶ\r\n  τὸν πηλὸν, εἴπου δέοι χρῆσθαι, ἀγγείων ἀπορίᾳ, ἐπὶ τοῦ νώτου ἔφερον,\r\n  ἐγκεκυφότες τε, ὡς μάλιστα μέλλοι ἐπιμένειν, καὶ τὼ χεῖρε ἐς τοὐπίσω\r\n  ξυμπλέκοντες, ὅπως μὴ ἀποπίπτοι.

This was particularly the case with that which grew in the\r\nmarket-place of Megara. The oracle had foretold, that when this tree\r\nshould be cut down the city would be sacked and destroyed, which was\r\nbrought to pass by Demetrius. On this occasion the tree being felled and\r\nsawed into planks, greaves and other articles of Athenian workmanship\r\nwere found in the heart of it.[1026] Fragments of the timber remained in\r\nthe time of Theophrastus.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1020:\r\n\r\n  Among the frailest dwellings of mankind, with the exception perhaps of\r\n  the paper houses of the Japanese, we may mention those of the\r\n  Nasamones described by Herodotus, composed of the stems of the\r\n  asphodel intertwisted with rushes: οἰκήματα δὲ σύμπηκτα ἐξ ἀνθερίκων\r\n  ἐνερμένων περὶ σχοίνους ἐστὶ, καὶ ταῦτα περιφορητά. iv. 190.

Among the paintings of\r\nHerculaneum[1033] we find the representation of a carpenter’s workshop,\r\nwhere two winged genii are busily employed with the mallet and the saw.\r\nIn making lines, &c., they used the ruddle now employed.[1034]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1027:\r\n\r\n  Lucian.

To traverse this they constructed\r\nbridges of fir, and when the flood rose still higher, bridge upon bridge\r\nwas erected in succession. Afterwards when the waters had worked\r\nthemselves a passage and ebbed off, the whole of the wood of these\r\nbridges was found in the completest preservation.[1036] The other kinds\r\nof timber were the elm, used for doors, hinges, and weasel traps;[1037]\r\nthe cypress,[1038] cedar, and juniper for wainscoting, beams, and\r\npaneled ceilings; the Arcadian, and the Idæan yew,[1039] which latter\r\nwas sometimes fraudulently substituted for cedar; the Eubœan walnut,\r\nand the beech, which, not being subject to the rot, were resorted to for\r\npiles and substructions.[1040] The former of these trees, which grew to\r\nan extraordinary size, was likewise applied to the roofing of houses,\r\nchiefly because, by a loud crackling noise, it gave notice when it was\r\nabout to break, and thus afforded the inmates leisure to effect their\r\nescape. This happened at the public baths of Antandros, where the\r\ncompany foreseeing from this warning sound the catastrophe that was\r\napproaching, rushed forth into the streets, and thus avoided being\r\noverwhelmed beneath the ruins.[1041]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1035:\r\n\r\n  In this country the pitch pine (πίτυς) was rare, but it abounded in\r\n  Elis.

The wood of all glutinous trees is\r\nnaturally flexible, but more especially that of the mulberry and the\r\nwild fig, for which reason these, together with the platane, and the\r\npoplar, were used for making the bended rims of chariot-seats, and the\r\ncircles of wheels.[1046] For spokes, the wood of the cornel tree was\r\npreferred, and that of the box, the yew, the maple, and the\r\ncarpinus—hedge-beech, or hornbeam—for the yokes of oxen. In old times\r\nthe bodies of carts were often formed of basket-work.

It may now be determined in the affirmative, since, besides the\r\nseveral testimonies of classical writers, which are much too clear to be\r\nset aside, we find in several Herculanean pictures exact representations\r\nof saddles, both on horses and asses, with girths and cruppers exactly\r\nas in modern times.[1049] It is evident, too, that they are constructed\r\nupon wooden frames, to which Herodotus may possibly allude where he\r\nspeaks of saddles made of tanned human skins.[1050] Packsaddles for\r\nsumpter-asses are of constant occurrence in history; and that they were\r\ntolerably thick may be inferred from the fact, that numbers of daggers\r\nwere concealed in them by Aratos in his attempt upon Argos.[1051] I\r\nshall here mention, also, by the way, and without entering into any\r\ndiscussion, that horses and asses were occasionally shod by the\r\nancients,[1052] though the practice was doubtless not universal.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1048:\r\n\r\n  Beckmann decides for the negative, i. 247.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1049:\r\n\r\n  Antich. di Ercol. t. ii. tav. 12, p. 79. t. iii. pp. 227. 231.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1050:\r\n\r\n  Herod. iv. 64.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1051:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

With respect to the price of\r\nfurniture at Athens,[1057] it seems much better to be silent than by a\r\nfew imperfect conjectures to confine the mind of the reader. We know\r\nabsolutely nothing of the matter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1057:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Bœckh, Pub. Econ. of Athens. i. 1441, whose laborious\r\n  researches on this subject lead to no result.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAmong the Egyptians, the roots of the Persea,[1058] a beautiful\r\nfruit-tree, said to have been poisonous in Persia,[1059] furnished the\r\nmaterials not only of statues but of bedsteads and tables, which were of\r\na rich dark colour and received a fine polish.[1060] There was likewise,\r\nin Syria, a species of wood the blackness of which was interveined with\r\nruddy streaks, so that it looked like variegated ebony. From this were\r\nmanufactured bedsteads, chairs, and other expensive articles of\r\nfurniture.[1061] The maple-tree grows both on plains and mountains. In\r\nthe latter situation its wood is of a pleasant reddish colour, finely\r\nveined and solid,[1062] on which account it was much used in superior\r\ncabinet-work. The zygian maple, in general beautifully clouded, was so\r\nhard, that it required to be steeped in water before it could be\r\nwrought.[1063] Of all woods the ancients considered that of the\r\ncypress[1064] the most durable, and it is related in confirmation of\r\nthis opinion, that the doors of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos, which\r\nwere made of it, had already lasted four centuries in the time of\r\nTheophrastus.[1065] It took the finest polish, and was therefore\r\nemployed in costly cabinet-work. The wood of the tree called thuia (a\r\nspecies perhaps of wild cypress), abounding in Cyrenè, and the Oasis of\r\nJupiter Ammon,[1066] was thought to be incorruptible; and from its\r\nroots, which were beautifully clouded, the most delicate articles of\r\nfurniture were manufactured. Next to these the wood of the mulberry-tree\r\nwas preferred, which exhibited a dusky grain like that of the\r\nlotos.[1067] Expensive bedsteads were sometimes made of oxya and\r\ncitron-wood, the feet of which, among the Persians, were often turned\r\nfrom the wood of the doom-palm,[1068] as they were formed among the\r\nGreeks from amber.[1069] Statues,[1070] which ought in truth to be\r\nregarded as articles of furniture, were carved from cedar,\r\ncypress,[1071] lotos, box, and of a smaller size from the roots of\r\nolive-trees, because they did not crack.[1072] Besides these which were\r\nperhaps the more common, we find mention in ancient writers of images of\r\nebony, oak, yew, maple, beech, palm,[1073] myrtle, pear, linden, and\r\nvine, to which may be added the fig-tree which was frequently preferred\r\non account of its soft texture, lightness, shining whiteness, and\r\nclose-grain. Occasionally statues of horses were carved of ebony and\r\nivory. As during the prevalence of certain winds several of these kinds\r\nof woods were liable to sweat,[1074] the vulgar, who understood nothing\r\nof the cause, regarded the circumstance as a prodigy.[1075]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1058:\r\n\r\n  This tree, which bore fruit in Egypt, only flowered in Rhodes. iii. 3.\r\n  5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1059:\r\n\r\n  Ælian.

Cf. cap. xxii. p. 67, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Greece when individuals, not possessing costly\r\nfurniture, desired to give a grand entertainment, they hired whatever\r\narticles they stood in need of, as seats, beds, vases, &c., of a broker,\r\nwhose business, in the island of Samos, was once carried on by the\r\ntyrant Polycrates.[1084]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1084:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xii. 57.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs ivory entered largely into the making of furniture among the\r\nancients,[1085] the reader will not regret to find here an explanation\r\nof the means by which it was rendered soft and tractable. This secret\r\nappears hitherto to have escaped the modern writers on Art. Monsieur\r\nDutens[1086] and the Milanese editors of Winkelmann[1087] observe, that\r\nthe ancients possessed the art of softening ivory without, however,\r\ngiving any intimation that they understood in what the secret consisted.\r\nBut the whole matter was extremely simple, since they merely steeped the\r\npiece of ivory about to be worked in a fermented liquor, called\r\nzythos,[1088] prepared from barley, and drank commonly, with or without\r\na mixture of honey, by all persons in Gaul. Many of these ivory\r\nornaments were produced by the turning-lathe. They turned also from the\r\nknots of the Arcadian fir large bowls of a shining black colour.[1089]\r\nThere was even a kind of stone which, being soft when drawn from the\r\nquarry, was turned and cut into bowls, plates, and other articles for\r\nthe table, which were susceptible of a high polish, and became hard by\r\nconstant exposure to the air.[1090]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1085:\r\n\r\n  Luc.

Others preferred the Laconian scytale,[1092]\r\nfashioned usually from a piece of whitethorn, and philosophers, sticks\r\nof olive-wood.[1093] Rustics then, as now, were in the habit of carrying\r\ntwisted and uncouth walkingstaves, bent sometimes atop, and of heavy\r\nmaterials. The straight light stem of the malachè,[1094] and birch, and\r\nelder,[1095] were likewise in use; while some carried sticks made from\r\nthe agnus castus or the laurel, which were believed to possess the\r\nvirtue of preserving those who bore them from accident or injury.[1096]\r\nThe making of umbrellas or parasols, which opened and closed like our\r\nown,[1097] no doubt constituted a separate branch of industry. These\r\narticles, it may be observed, were manufactured with great elegance,\r\nwith handles gracefully ornamented, and furnished at the periphery[1098]\r\nwith numerous elongated drops. It was, probably, the same tradesmen in\r\nwhose shops were found those folding-seats, or camp-stools, invented by\r\nDædalos, the use of which seems to have been very common at\r\nAthens.[1099]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1091:\r\n\r\n  Gitone, Il Costume, pl. 20.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1092:\r\n\r\n  Casaub. ad Theoph.

Musical instruments were divided by\r\nthe ancients into three kinds:[1100] those which were played by means of\r\nthe breath,—the pipe, the trumpet, and the flute; those whose harmony\r\nresided in their strings, as the lyre and the cithara; and those which\r\nproduced sound by beating or clashing against each other, as cymbals and\r\nthe drum. The best trumpets, supposed to have been an invention of the\r\nTyrrhenians,[1101] were obtained from Italy, though on many occasions\r\ngreat sea-shells were substituted for those larger instruments. In the\r\nEast, trumpets were sometimes manufactured of cow-hide, though the usual\r\nmaterials were brass and iron, with a little bone for the\r\nmouth-piece.[1102] There were two kinds,—the straight and the crooked.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1100:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

In lieu of trumpets the Indians, we are told, made\r\n  use of certain whips, by the flourishing and cracking of which in the\r\n  air they produced a kind of rude music. These strange sounds were\r\n  accompanied by the low and terrible roll of their great drums, which\r\n  still continue to delight the ear of the Hindùs. Suid. v. σάλπιγξ, t.\r\n  ii. 709. b.

The fashioning of the common pipe constituted an important\r\nbranch of industry, particularly in Bœotia, where the reed[1104] from\r\nwhich it was made abounded in the Orchomenian marshes,[1105] between the\r\nCephisos and the Melas, in the place called Pelecania.[1106] The season\r\nfor cutting, which prevailed up to the age of Antigones, was the month\r\nBoedromion; but, for the improvement of the instrument, that musician\r\naltered the time, which thenceforward was in the months Scirophorion and\r\nHecatombion.[1107] The reeds were prepared in the following manner:\r\nbeing cut, they were piled in a heap with their leaves on, and left in\r\nthe open air during the whole winter. Having in spring been cleared of\r\ntheir outer integuments, well rubbed and exposed to the sun, they were,\r\nduring the summer, cut into lengths at the knots, and left a little\r\nlonger in the open air.[1108] The internodial spaces did not fall short\r\nof two palms in length, and the best portions of the reed used for\r\nmaking the double pipe[1109] was about the middle.[1110] Pipes and\r\nflutes[1111] were likewise manufactured of the leg-bones of stags, at\r\nleast in Bœotia. The lotos-wood[1112] transverse flute was an\r\ninvention of the Africans. The elymœan flute made of boxwood owed its\r\norigin to the Phrygians, and was played during the worship of Cybelè.\r\nThat called hippophorbos was invented by the last dwellers of Libya, who\r\nhabitually played on it while pasturing their great droves of horses in\r\nthe desert.[1113] It appears to have been a very simple instrument,\r\nfashioned of a piece of laurel-wood, by removing the bark and scooping\r\nout the pith. Its sharp shrill sound which could be heard far and near,\r\ndelighted the ears of the horses, who probably, like the Turks, estimate\r\nthe merit of music by its loudness. The monaulos, a favourite invention\r\nof the Egyptians, spoken of by Sophocles in his Thamyris, was usually\r\nplayed in marriage concerts.[1114] The lugubrious funeral-pipe of the\r\nCarians was a Phrygian invention. There existed among the Thebans a\r\ncurious instrument of this kind, probably used in hunting, made from the\r\nbones of fawns, with a coating of bronze.[1115] The Tyrrhenians, like\r\nthe rude sportsmen of Europe, drew music from the horn. Among the\r\nPhœnicians was a small flute made of goose-bones, not exceeding a\r\nspan in length, called gingras[1116] in honour of Adonis, so named in\r\ntheir language, which emitting a plaintive and melancholy note, was\r\ndoubtless much used in the wailing orgies of that divinity. Its\r\ncharacter being exceedingly simple, it was habitually put into the hands\r\nof beginners,[1117] and seems to have been very common at Athens. The\r\nmost extraordinary pipes, however, enumerated by ancient writers, were\r\nthe ones in which those Scythian tribes denominated by the Greeks,\r\nCannibals, Black Cloaks, and Arimaspians, delighted; and manufactured\r\nfrom the leg-bones of eagles and vultures.[1118] The Celts and the\r\nislanders of the ocean, our own forefathers, doubtless eschewed the\r\nmusic of vultures’ legs, and contented themselves with the notes of the\r\nsyrinx.[1119]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1103:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Vitruv. ix. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf stringed-instruments the most common was the lyre,[1123] manufactured\r\nfrom many kinds of fine wood, and sometimes of ivory.[1124] The bridge\r\nwas usually of ilex.[1125] The cithara,[1126] introduced at Athens by\r\nPhrynis,[1127] was made sometimes of horn with wooden pegs,[1128] though\r\nmention occurs of one formed entirely of solid gold, adorned with\r\nfigures in relief of the Muses, Orpheus, and Apollo, and thickly studded\r\nwith emeralds and other precious stones.[1129] The magadis,[1130]\r\nsometimes reckoned among wind-instruments, was unquestionably stringed,\r\nsince we find Timotheus, accused at Sparta of innovating in the number\r\nof its chords, pointing out to his accuser an ancient statue of Apollo,\r\nin which the god was represented playing on a magadis with an equal\r\nnumber.[1131] In proof of its antiquity it may be remarked, that\r\nLesbothemis, a sculptor, who flourished in a remote age at Mytilene,\r\nwhere this instrument was always in high favour,[1132] represented one\r\nof the Muses with the magadis in her hand. The pectis, said to have been\r\nan invention of Sappho, and by some confounded with the magadis, ought\r\nrather perhaps to be regarded as a modification of that\r\ninstrument.[1133] The epigoneion, so called from its inventor Epigonos,\r\nby birth an Ambraciot, though afterwards made a citizen of Sicyon, was a\r\nkind of harp with forty strings, resembling, probably, those\r\nmany-chorded instruments represented on the monuments of Egypt and\r\nEthiopia. This Epigonos, is said to have been the first person who in\r\nplaying dispensed with the use of the plectron.[1134] The ancient Arabs\r\nforestalled Signor Paganini, and drew a world of sweet sounds from an\r\ninstrument of one chord:[1135] the Assyrians had their pandoura, with\r\nthree strings.[1136] Among the Scythians was found the pentachordon,\r\nstringed with thongs of raw bull-hide, and played on by a plectron of\r\ngoat’s hoof. The Libyans, more especially the Troglodytes, filled their\r\ncaverns with the music of the psithura, otherwise called the ascaron, an\r\ninstrument a cubit square, which produced sounds resembling the tinkling\r\nof castanets. Cantharos attributes its invention to the Thracians. To\r\nthese we may add the drum, the tambourine,[1137] with cymbals, and\r\ncastanets, sometimes of brass, and sometimes of shells, played on by\r\nwomen in honour of Artemis.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1123:\r\n\r\n  A rude species of lyre is still in use in Asia Minor.

Among these, Athens,[1139] Samos, and Rhodes held\r\nthe first rank.[1140] Even the Bœotian Aulis obtained some degree of\r\nreputation for its earthenware.[1141] But that made at Kolias,[1142] in\r\nAttica, from the clay there found, and richly painted with figures in\r\nminium, appears to have been the most beautiful known to antiquity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1138:\r\n\r\n  On the potter’s wheel, see Suidas. v. κωλιάδος κεραμῆες. t. i. p.\r\n  1511. b.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1139:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph.

Compend. ii. 16.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe number of rough articles produced was prodigious, seeing that oil,\r\nand wine, and salt-fish, and pickles, and a variety of other commodities\r\nwere exported in jars; while almost all culinary operations were carried\r\non in earthern vessels. Such of these as found their way to Egypt, after\r\nthe conquest of that country by the Persians, were filled with Nile\r\nwater, and transported into the desert, on camels, to slake the thirst\r\nof the wayfarers on that arid waste.[1143] Perhaps, the largest articles\r\nof earthenware, however, were the corn-jars, some of which are said to\r\nhave contained nearly a quarter of grain, in lieu of which plaited\r\ncorbels were sometimes used.[1144] Much art and elegance was displayed\r\nin the forms, varnishing, and painting of fictile vases, some of which,\r\nof light and graceful contour, were made without bottoms, wholly for\r\nornament.[1145] The colours employed in the painting of vases, more\r\nparticularly those intended to hold the ashes of the dead, were\r\ngenerally light and durable; and the ease and beauty of the figures\r\nprove that the ancient potters paid great attention to the arts of\r\ndesign. The ornaments were extremely various, sometimes consisting of\r\nrepresentations of the gods, as Heracles, Pan, or the genii, sometimes\r\nof oakleaves, garlands, or festoons, arranged with taste and\r\nelegance.[1146] Athenæus speaks of a kind of porcelain called\r\nRhossican,[1147] covered with the forms of flowers, upon which Cleopatra\r\nexpended five minæ per day. Another branch of the potter’s business\r\nconsisted in the manufacturing of lamps,[1148] which were so generally\r\nin use, that, throughout the Greek and the Roman world, the sites of\r\ncities, the ruins of temples, and the sepulchral chambers excavated\r\nbeneath the earth, lavishly abound with them, entire or in\r\nfragments.[1149] Hyperbolos is said to have amassed a considerable\r\nfortune by selling lamps of an inferior quality.[1150] Wax-candles,\r\nhowever, were likewise in use, at least in later ages,[1151] and with\r\nthe same materials they fashioned artificial pomegranates and other\r\nornaments, together with small portable images of animals, men, and\r\ngods, which, like our figures of plaster of Paris, were sold, as well as\r\nthose of clay, about the streets. Some notion, too, may be formed of the\r\nprice, since we find that a figure of Eros fetched a drachma.[1152]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1143:\r\n\r\n  Herodot. iii. 6.

They are\r\n  mentioned, however, in a letter of Adrian to the Consul Servianus:\r\n  “Calices tibi _allassontes_ versicolores transmisi, quos mihi sacerdos\r\n  templi obtulit, tibi et sorori meæ specialiter dedicatos, quos tu\r\n  velim festis diebus conviviis adhibeas.” Vopisc. in Vit. Saturnin.\r\n  cap. viii. Casaubon, in his note on this passage, speaks of these cups\r\n  in the following terms: Allassontes qui colorem mutant sicut\r\n  palumborum colla. The murrhine vases, the nature of which so many have\r\n  attempted to explain, if they were not after all a species of glass,\r\n  appear at least to have had many analogous qualities; and the\r\n  following description of Pliny is calculated to create the highest\r\n  idea of their beauty: “Splendor his sine viribus: nitorque verius quam\r\n  splendor. Sed in pretio varietas colorum subinde circumagentibus se\r\n  maculis in purpuram candoremque, et tertium ex utroque ignescentem,\r\n  veluti per transitum coloris, in purpura, aut rubescente lacteo.

Petronius informs us, that, in the reign of Tiberius, a\r\nskilful experimentalist discovered the art of rendering this substance\r\nmalleable, but that the emperor, from some freak of tyranny, put the man\r\nto death, and thus his secret was lost to the world.[1161] A similar act\r\nof cruelty was perpetrated by the public authorities at Dantzic, who, in\r\nthe seventeenth century, caused an able mechanician, who had invented a\r\nsuperior kind of ribbon-loom, to be strangled.[1162]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1160:\r\n\r\n  Strab. ap.

It must necessarily be inferred, however, that there\r\nexisted a class of shopkeepers analogous to our oil and colour men, at\r\nwhose establishments were found most or all of the following\r\ncommodities: every kind of vegetable oil, for cookery, painting, or to\r\nbe burned as lamp-oil, of sea salt, probably for medicinal\r\npurposes,[1163] oil of horseradish,[1164] used instead of the root\r\nitself, as a condiment. Among the lamp-oils it is worthy of observation\r\nthat the Greeks included castor oil[1165] which was commonly, from its\r\nnauseous effects, eschewed as a medicine. Bitumen[1166] also was\r\noccasionally burnt in lamps. Their lampwicks were ordinarily of\r\nrushes,[1167] which they sometimes anointed with the oil expressed from\r\nthe seeds of the myagrum perenne;[1168] and from certain nuts found on\r\nthe oak they obtained a sort of woolly substance[1169] which, being\r\ntwisted into wicks, burnt freely without oil. The dried stem of the\r\ntorch-weed[1170] was likewise employed for this purpose. Their flambeaux\r\nconsisted originally of slips of the pine or pitch tree,[1171] or even\r\nas at Rhodes of the bark of the vine,[1172] but afterwards certain\r\ncombustible compositions were burned in painted and ornamented\r\nhandles.[1173]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1163:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph.

The billets of wood were then piled up endways as\r\nclose to each other as possible, and so as that the height of the heap\r\nshould always be in proportion to its magnitude. These piles were\r\nfrequently of enormous dimensions, falling little short of a hundred\r\nyards in circumference and rising to the height of eighty or ninety\r\nfeet. The whole mound was then covered with turf and earth; and the wood\r\nhaving been set on fire by means of an open passage below, which\r\nimmediately afterwards was closed, numerous ladders were thrown up along\r\nits sides in order that, should the least smoke anywhere appear, fresh\r\nlayers of turf and earth might be cast upon it: for if the flame found a\r\nvent the hopes of the manufacturer were destroyed. The pitch flowed off\r\nby an underground channel leading from the centre of the area to a\r\nspacious cistern sunk in the earth about twenty feet beyond the\r\ncircumference of the mound, where it was suffered to cool. During two\r\ndays and two nights the fire in these heaps continued generally to burn,\r\nrequiring the incessant care and vigilance of the workmen, though it\r\nfrequently happened that before sunset on the second day, the earthy\r\ncrust flattened and fell in, the wood being reduced to ashes. This was\r\ngenerally preceded by the pitch ceasing to flow. The whole of this\r\nperiod was converted into a holiday by the labourers, who offered\r\nsacrifice to the gods, and preferred many prayers, that their pitch\r\nmight be plentiful and good.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1174:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

It has\r\nbeen supposed that the ancients were acquainted with gunpowder;[1176]\r\nand there appears to have been a dim tradition of artificial thunder and\r\nlightning among the Brachmanes in the remotest antiquity.[1177]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1175:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

The\r\nSamian, being fat and unctuous,[1180] was eschewed by painters, though\r\nit found its place among the materia medica. Another article in much\r\nrequest was the argol, a beautiful moss,[1181] used both by painters and\r\ndyers; to which we may add the cinnabar[1182] and the kermes, used for\r\ndying scarlet; the Indian black,[1183] indigo, ultramarine, lamp and\r\nivory black, painter’s soot, collected from glass furnaces,[1184]\r\nverdigris, ceruse, and minium, used in painting vases and clay\r\nstatues.[1185] Other substances which sometimes entered into the\r\nmaterials of painters were, the sandarach[1186] and the orpiment, found\r\nin gold, silver, and copper mines, ochre, ruddle, and chrysocolla.\r\nRuddle was successfully imitated by burnt ochre, the manufacturing of\r\nwhich was the invention of Cydias,[1187] who having observed that a\r\nquantity of ochre found in a house which was burnt down had assumed a\r\nred colour, profited by the hint, though the article thus produced was\r\ninferior to the natural. The Lemnian earth,[1188] having been mixed with\r\ngoats’ blood, kneaded into small round pastilles, and stamped with the\r\nfigure of a goat, was vended, partly as a medicine, partly to be used in\r\nsacrifice. In the same shops, doubtless, sealing-wax and ink were\r\nsold.[1189] The receipt for preparing the latter was as follows:[1190]\r\nto an ounce of gum they added three ounces of pine-torch or resin soot,\r\nor even that which was obtained from the glass furnaces, and used, as\r\nabove observed, by painters. In this latter case, a mina of soot was\r\nmingled with a pound and a half of gum, and an ounce and a half of\r\nbull’s glue and copperas-water. An infusion of wormwood[1191] was\r\nsometimes used in the manufacture of ink, which preserved the\r\nmanuscripts written with it from being gnawed by rats or other vermin.\r\nAnother method was, to smear the parchment with saffron and cedar\r\noil.[1192]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1178:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. v. 180.

By the odour of this oil the books of Numa\r\n  were said, by tradition, to have been preserved for many generations.\r\n  “Mirabantur alii, quomodo illi libri durare potuissent: ille (Hemina)\r\n  ita rationem reddebat: lapidem fuisse quadratum circiter in mediâ arcâ\r\n  vinctum candelis quoquo versus.

Hist.\r\n  xiii. 27. To the virtues of this oil Vitruvius also bears testimony.\r\n  “Quæ unguntur cedrio, ut libri à tineis et carie non læduntur.” ii. 9.\r\n  In the above passage of Pliny, Hardouin reads “libros citratos,” and\r\n  supposes the naturalist to mean that citron-leaves were folded in the\r\n  manuscript: “quorum hæc propria dos, ut arceant animalium noxia, hoc\r\n  est, tineas.” Cf. Plin. Nat. Hist. xii. 7. But as the citron was not\r\n  introduced into Greece or Italy until several centuries after the age\r\n  of Numa, it is very clear that “cedratos” must remain in the text of\r\n  Pliny.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNext to these, perhaps, should be ranged those shops which resembled our\r\nItalian warehouses, where the gourmands of antiquity procured their best\r\nvinegar, pickles, and sauces.[1193] To enumerate all the articles found\r\nin such an establishment would be somewhat difficult; but we may observe\r\nthat they sold, among other things, the best Colophonian mustard,[1194]\r\npepper,[1195] together with all the substitutes occasionally used for\r\nit, such as the Syrian nard,[1196] water-pepper,[1197] and, among the\r\nancient Italians, lovage of Lombardy,[1198] garlic heads,[1199] a\r\nmixture of salt and thyme,[1200] pickled olives, and cornel-berries, to\r\nbe eaten at table, pickled dittander,[1201] mountain rue,[1202]\r\nsnakeweed or wake-robin, fennel or chervil, tendrils of the wild\r\nvine,[1203] eringo root, sea-heath, cammock, lettuces and parsley.[1204]\r\nTo these may be added silphion, sesame, citron-peel, cumin, wild\r\nmarjoram, capers, cresses, and fig-leaves.[1205] Among the Syrians, the\r\nroot and seeds of the sison-amomum were used as spices, and pickled with\r\nsliced gourds.[1206] The Arabs, we are told, seasoned their dishes with\r\nthe leaf of the ginger plant.[1207] Ginger-root was likewise known and\r\nused as a condiment in Greece.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1193:\r\n\r\n  Diog.

There were, for example, ranged in order on\r\nshelves, numerous medicine chests of ivory; brass and silver cupping\r\ninstruments,[1210] lancet-cases, and cases inlaid with gold.[1211]\r\nFlowers and aromatic plants were laid up in boxes of the wood of the\r\nlinden tree, while seeds were preserved in paper or leaves. Liquid\r\nmedicines were kept in vessels of silver, glass, or horn, or even in\r\nearthenware jars, provided they were well glazed. For these they\r\nsometimes substituted vases of boxwood, though those of metal were\r\ngenerally preferred, at least for all such as were intended for the\r\neyes, or contained vinegar, pitch, or cedar juice. Lard, marrow, and all\r\nsimilar substances, were put into vessels of pewter.[1212] The\r\ninstruments[1213] in most common use besides the bistoury, were the\r\nforceps, the scissors, the hypographs, the ear-pick, the probe,[1214]\r\nthe needle, the scalpel, the tooth-file, the tooth-wrench, the eueidion,\r\nand the podostrabe, an instrument for reducing luxations. We ought,\r\nlikewise, perhaps, to mention the bandages, ligatures, swathes,\r\nplaisters, lint, amulets, and bleeding-bowls.[1215]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1210:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

By degrees these treatises were greatly multiplied, and\r\nincluded, at length, a species of encyclopedia, arranged in alphabetical\r\norder;[1216] though not one single fragment of it has been spared by\r\ntime. At first, and for many ages, the art relied chiefly upon simples,\r\nthe qualities of which were consequently studied with great ardour, and,\r\nno doubt, with much success. Numerous individuals devoted themselves to\r\nthe gathering, drying, and preserving, of medicinal roots and herbs, an\r\noccupation requiring considerable time and labour,—for which reasons the\r\nphysicians, by whom it was originally performed, soon abandoned it to\r\nthe rizotomists.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1216:\r\n\r\n  Dioscorides, however, who mentions this work, is far from speaking of\r\n  the plan with praise: ἥμαρτον δὲ καὶ περὶ τὴν τάξιν· οἱ μὲν ἀσυμφύλους\r\n  δυνάμεις συγκρούσαντεσ· οἱ δὲ κατὰ στοιχεῖα ἀναγράψαντες. διέζευξαν\r\n  τῆς ὁμογενείας τὰ τε γένη καὶ τὰς ἐνεργείας αὐτῶν, ὡς διὰ τοῦτο\r\n  ἀσυμμνημόνευτα γίνεσθαι. Proœm. p. 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the business of collecting simples, by whomsoever performed,\r\nrequired great knowledge and perseverance. The individuals who carried\r\nit on spread themselves, at the proper seasons of the year, through all\r\nGreece, more especially over Mount Pelion in Thessaly, Telethra in\r\nEubœa, Parnassos in Phocis, and the uplands of Laconia and\r\nArcadia,[1217] making inquiries, as they went along, of the inhabitants\r\nof every district and canton respecting the medicaments in use among\r\nthem, and collecting from the mouths of peasants and shepherds the\r\nfruits of their limited but close observation. They passed, as a matter\r\nof course, the greater part of their lives in the fields, studying the\r\ntopography and distribution of plants, and investigating all the\r\nphenomena of vegetation. They believed, that herbs vary in virtues and\r\npowers according as they are found in mountains or in valleys, in places\r\noverrun with moisture, and where the air is rank and heavy, or on spots\r\nswelling and exposed, where they are fanned and invigorated by every\r\nbreeze that blows. They laid much stress, too, on the season of the\r\nyear, on the weather, and on the hour of the day; some simples\r\nrequiring, it was supposed, to be gathered when the sun has exhaled from\r\nthem all extraneous moisture, others before its rising, others amid the\r\ndarkness of night when their leaves and flowers were suffused with dew.\r\nThey were guided, likewise, in their operations by other rules, some\r\nfounded on experience, others originating in fancy and superstition. In\r\nculling, for example, the thapsia[1218] and several other herbs, they\r\nwere careful, having first anointed themselves with oil, to stand with\r\ntheir backs to the wind, persuaded that they otherwise should inhale\r\ncertain noxious effluvia which would cause their whole bodies to swell,\r\nor, in the case of the dog-rose,[1219] that their sight would be\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1217:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. Hist. Plant. ix. 15. 3, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1218:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. iv. 157. Theoph. Hist. Plant. ix. 8. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1219:\r\n\r\n  Κυνόσβατον. Theoph. Hist. Plant. ix. 8. 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThose who gathered the mountain rue,[1220] anointed their faces and\r\nhands with oil, to guard themselves against cutaneous inflammation.\r\nAgain, of other herbs the juices are so pungent as to burn like fire:\r\nthese were collected in the greatest haste. In digging the\r\nhellebore,[1221] too, the odour of which was supposed rapidly to affect\r\nthe brain, they proceeded with great celerity, and were careful to eat a\r\nclove or two of garlic beforehand, and to drink a little pure wine\r\nafter. But all these precautions were trifling compared with those which\r\nthe good rizotomists had persuaded themselves were indispensable in\r\ncollecting the peony flower.[1222] About this operation they interwove a\r\nsort of netting of romance: it was to be undertaken they affirmed by\r\nnight, lest the woodpeckers, who regarded it with as much jealousy as\r\nthe Indian ants do their gold, should fall upon the unfortunate\r\nherbalists, and with their sharp beaks pluck out their eyes. So,\r\nlikewise, in gathering the centaury they were to stand on their guard\r\nlest they should be assaulted and maltreated by the hawks. Considering\r\nall these numerous evils which rizotomist flesh was heir to,\r\nTheophrastus thinks it by no means absurd, that when issuing forth on an\r\nenterprise so perilous, they should have fortified their nerves with\r\nmany prayers. Some few, however, of their practices the philosopher\r\ncondemns as a trifle beyond the mark, as for example when in digging the\r\nroot of the Asclepian all-heal, they judged it necessary to propitiate\r\nmother earth by burying in its stead a cake composed of many various\r\nsweets. And again in unearthing the root of the iris fœtidissima,\r\nthey interred a cake of spring wheat mixed with honey, not, however,\r\nbefore they had drawn round the spot a treble circle with a two-edged\r\nsword. When they had obtained possession of one of the roots, they held\r\nit up for some time in the air, and then proceeded to procure a second,\r\nand so on. Strangest of all, however, were the ceremonies observed in\r\ndigging the mandrake.[1223] First, the triple magic circle was inscribed\r\non the earth with a sword, then the pious rizotomist turned his face\r\ntoward the west, and began to use his knife, while a second operator\r\nwent dancing round, uttering all kinds of amorous incantations. Still\r\nmore perilous was the gathering of the black hellebore, which they\r\nperformed with the face towards the east, and many prayers to Apollo and\r\nAsclepios.[1224] The strictest watch was meanwhile to be kept, that no\r\neagle appeared above the horizon; for if the eye of this king of birds\r\nhappened to fall upon the herbalist while engaged in digging, he would\r\ninfallibly die within the year.[1225]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1220:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. iii. 53.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1221:\r\n\r\n  King Attalus, desirous not to have far to reach in the matter of\r\n  poisons, cultivated a great variety of them with his own hands in the\r\n  royal gardens, such as hyoscyamus, hellebore, hemlock, aconite, and\r\n  dorycnion, of whose virtue and qualities he obtained a thorough\r\n  knowledge by experiments.

Dioscor. iii. 151.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAfter all these toilsome and dangerous enterprises it was natural that\r\nthe rizotomists should desire to enjoy some advantages,[1226] which,\r\naccordingly, they procured themselves by selling dear their hard-won\r\nprizes to their equally superstitious countrymen. Making no pretension\r\nas I have said to describe the regular medical practice among the\r\nGreeks, I shall here, nevertheless, introduce some few particulars more\r\nor less connected with it, which may be regarded as characteristic of\r\nthe age and people.[1227] Great were the virtues which they ascribed to\r\nthe herb alysson, (biscutella didyma,) which, being pounded and eaten\r\nwith meat, cured hydrophobia. Nay, more, being suspended in a house, it\r\npromoted the health of its inhabitants;[1228] it protected likewise both\r\nman and cattle from enchantment; and, bound in a piece of scarlet\r\nflannel round the necks of the latter, it preserved them from all\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1226:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Plant. vii.\r\n  13. 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCoriander-seed,[1229] eaten in too great quantity, produced, they\r\nthought, a derangement of the intellect. Ointment of saffron had an\r\nopposite effect, for the nostrils and heads of lunatics being rubbed\r\ntherewith they were supposed to receive considerable relief.[1230]\r\nMelampos the goatherd was reported to have cured the daughters of\r\nPrætos[1231] of their madness by large doses of black hellebore, which\r\nthereafter received from him the name of Melampodion. Sea-onions[1232]\r\nsuspended over the doors preserved from enchantment, as did likewise a\r\nbranch of rhamnus over doors or windows.[1233] A decoction of\r\nrosemary[1234] and of the leaves and stem of the anemone[1235] was\r\nadministered to nurses to promote the secretion of milk, and a like\r\npotion prepared from the leaves of the Cretan dittany[1236] was given to\r\nwomen in labour. This herb, in order to preserve its virtues unimpaired,\r\nand that it might be the more easily transported to all parts of the\r\ncountry, was preserved in a joint of a ferula or reed. A plaster of\r\nincense,[1237] Cimolian earth, and oil of roses, was applied to reduce\r\nthe swelling of the breasts. A medicine prepared from mule’s fern,[1238]\r\nwas believed to produce sterility, as were likewise the waters of a\r\ncertain fountain near Pyrrha, while to those about Thespiæ a contrary\r\neffect was attributed, as well as to the wine of Heraclea in\r\nArcadia.[1239] The inhabitants of this primitive region drank milk as an\r\naperient[1240] in the spring, because of the medicinal herbs on which\r\nthe cattle were then supposed to feed. Medicines of laxative properties\r\nwere prepared from the juice of the wild cucumber, which were said to\r\nretain their virtues for two hundred years,[1241] though simples in\r\ngeneral were thought to lose their medicinal qualities in less than\r\nfour.[1242] The oriental gum called kankamon was administered in water\r\nor honeyed vinegar to fat persons to diminish their obesity, and also as\r\na remedy for the toothache.[1243] For this latter purpose the gum of the\r\nEthiopian olive[1244] was put into the hollow tooth, though more\r\nefficacy perhaps was attributed to the root of dittander[1245] which\r\nthey suspended as a charm about the neck. A plaster of the root of the\r\nwhite thorn[1246] or iris[1247] roots prepared with flour of copper,\r\nhoney, and great centaury, drew out thorns and arrowheads without pain.\r\nAn unguent procured from fern[1248] was sold to rustics for curing the\r\nnecks of their cattle galled by the yoke. A decoction of marsh-mallow\r\nleaves[1249] and wine or honeyed vinegar was administered to persons who\r\nhad been stung by bees or wasps or other insects;[1250] bites and burns\r\nwere healed by an external application of the leaf smeared with oil, and\r\nthe powdered roots cast into water caused it to freeze if placed out\r\nduring the night in the open air; an unguent was prepared with oil from\r\nreeds, green or dry, which protected those who anointed themselves with\r\nit, from the stings of venomous reptiles. Cinnamon unguent,[1251] or\r\nterebinth and myrtle-berries,[1252] boiled in wine, were supposed to be\r\na preservative against the bite of the tarantula or scorpion, as was the\r\npistachio nut against that of serpents.[1253] Some persons ate a roasted\r\nscorpion to cure its own bite;[1254] a powder, moreover, was prepared\r\nfrom sea-crabs supposed to be fatal to this reptile.[1255] Vipers[1256]\r\nwere made to contribute their part to the materia medica; for, being\r\ncaught alive, they were enclosed with salt and dried figs in a vase\r\nwhich was then put into a furnace till its contents were reduced to\r\ncharcoal, which they esteemed a valuable medicine. A considerable\r\nquantity of viper’s flesh was in the last century imported from Egypt\r\ninto Venice, to be used in the composition of medicinal treacle.[1257]\r\nFrom the flowers of the sneezewort,[1258] a sort of snuff appears to\r\nhave been manufactured, though probably used only in medicines. The\r\nashes of old leather[1259] cured burns, galls, and blistered feet.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1229:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. iii. 71.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1230:\r\n\r\n  Δύναμιν δὲ ἔχει (κρόκινον) θερμαντικὴν, ὑπνωτικὴν, ὅθεν πολλάκις ἐπὶ\r\n  φρενετικῶν ἁρμόζει καταβρεχόμενον, ἢ ἀποσφραινόμενον, ἦ καὶ κατα\r\n  μυζωτηρων διαχριόμενον.

Dioscor. ii. 51.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe common remedy when persons had eaten poisonous mushrooms was a dose\r\nof nitre exhibited in vinegar and water;[1260] with water it was\r\nesteemed a cure for the sting of the burncow, and with benzoin it\r\noperated as an antidote against the poison of bulls’ blood. The seeds of\r\nmountain-rue, in small quantities, were regarded as an antidote, but,\r\nadministered too copiously, were themselves lethal.[1261] White\r\nhellebore was employed with honey and other medicines to poison\r\nrats;[1262] bastard saffron,[1263] mice, pigs, and dogs; which last were\r\nphysicked with hellebore.[1264] The deadly qualities of this plant, when\r\ntaken in any quantity, were universally known, and, therefore, the\r\npharmacopolist, Thrasyas,[1265] of Mantinea, who boasted of having\r\ninvented a poison which would kill without pain, attained the credit of\r\npossessing something like miraculous powers, because he used frequently,\r\nin the presence of many witnesses to eat a whole root, or even two, of\r\nhellebore. One day, however, a shepherd, coming into his shop, utterly\r\ndestroyed his reputation; for, in the sight of all present, he devoured\r\na whole handful, observing that it was nothing at all, for that he and\r\nhis brethren on the mountains were accustomed to do as much, and more,\r\ndaily.[1266] They had, in fact, discovered, that medicine is no\r\nmedicine, and poison no poison, to those with whose bodies they have\r\nbeen assimilated by use. When limbs were to be amputated, and previous\r\nto the application of the cautery, a dose of powdered mandragora-root\r\nwas usually administered.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1260:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. v. 130.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1261:\r\n\r\n  Id. iii. 53.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1262:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. iv. 150.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1263:\r\n\r\n  Χαμαιλέων λευκὸς ... ἀποκτείνει καὶ κύνας καὶ ὗας καὶ μύας, σὺν ἀλφίτῳ\r\n  πεφυραμένη, καὶ ὑδρελαίῳ διεθεῖσα.

They, by certain preparations of\r\naconite,[1268] so called from Aconè, a village in the country of the\r\nMariandynians, the professional poisoners could take off an individual\r\nat any fixed period, from two months to two years. The possession,\r\nhowever, of this poison was in itself a capital offence.[1269] It was\r\nusually administered in wine or hydromel, where its presence was not to\r\nbe detected by the taste. At first, there was supposed to exist no\r\nremedy, so that all who took it inevitably perished; but, at length,\r\nphysicians, and even the common people of the country, discovered more\r\nthan one antidote prepared from the ground-pine,[1270] from honey, and\r\nfrom the juice of the grape. Another poison, evidently in frequent use,\r\nwas the bulb of the meadow-saffron (colchicum autumnale), which being\r\nknown to everybody, and nearly always at hand, slaves[1271] were said to\r\nhave plucked and eaten when enraged against their masters; but,\r\nrepenting presently, they used, with still greater celerity, to rush in\r\nsearch of an antidote. Some persons, anxious to fortify their children\r\nagainst the effects of all noxious drugs, were in the habit of\r\nadministering to them as soon as born a small dose of the powder of\r\nbindweed,[1272] which they believed to possess the power of protecting\r\nthem for ever. When persons were invited out to dine where they ran the\r\nrisk of meeting with ratsbane in their dishes, it was customary to chew\r\na little calamint before the repast.[1273] In the case of the canine\r\nspecies the Argives, instead of having recourse to poison, like their\r\nneighbours, used to celebrate an annual festival during the dog-days, in\r\nwhich they seem to have slaughtered[1274]\r\n\r\n                 Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,\r\n                 And cur of low degree,\r\n\r\nthe moist atmosphere of their city having been peculiarly liable to\r\nengender hydrophobia.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1267:\r\n\r\n  See on Scythian slow poison, Theoph. Hist. Plant. ix. 15. 2. Among the\r\n  Romans the lepus marinus (the aplysia depilens of Linnæus) was\r\n  sometimes used as a secret poison, as we find from the example of\r\n  Domitian, who employed it in removing his brother Titus. Δυοὶν δὲ\r\n  ἐτοῖν μετὰ τὸν πατέρα τὴν ἀρχὴν κατασχόντα, ὑπὸ τοῦ θαλαττίου λαγὼ\r\n  ἀποθανεῖν. τὸν δὲ ἰχθὺν τοῦτον, παρέχεσθαι χυμοὺς ἀποῤῥήτους, ὑπὲρ\r\n  πάντα τὰ ἐν τῇ θαλάττῃ καὶ γῇ ἀνδροφόνα. καὶ Νέρωνα μὲν ἐμποιῆσαι τοῖς\r\n  ἐαυτου ὄψοις τὸν λαγὼν τοῦτον ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμιωτάτους, Δομετιανὸν δὲ\r\n  ἐπὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν Τῖτον, οὐ τὸ ξὺν ἀδελφῷ ἄρχειν δεινὸν ἡγούμενον, ἀλλὰ\r\n  τὸ ξὺν πράῳ τε καὶ χρηστῷ.

It was esteemed\r\ndestructive of living bodies, but formed, doubtless, an important\r\ningredient among the embalmer’s materials, since it completely preserved\r\ncorpses from corruption, on which account it was sometimes called the\r\nLife of the Dead.[1275] It entered, moreover, into preparation designed\r\nto sharpen the sight.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1275:\r\n\r\n  Δύναμιν δὲ ἔχει σηπτικὴν μὲν τῶν ἐμψύχων, φυλακτικὴν δὲ τῶν νεκρῶν\r\n  σωμάτων. ὄθεν καὶ νεκροῦ ζωήν τινες αὐτὴν ἐκάλεσαν. Dioscor. i. 105.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe gum obtained from the cherry-tree[1276] was administered in wine and\r\nwater to promote appetite. A dose of saffron and boiled wine restored\r\nthe tone of the stomach after excess at table. Asses’ milk was\r\nhabitually given to consumptive patients, connected with which practice\r\nthere is an apothegm of Demosthenes, which may be worth repeating. When\r\nhe was once exerting himself to prevail on some foreign state to ally\r\nitself with Athens, an orator in opposition observed, that the Athenians\r\nwere like asses’ milk, whose presence always indicated sickness in the\r\nplaces they visited. “It is true,” replied Demosthenes, “but the\r\nsickness previously exists, and they come to cure it.” A mixture of salt\r\nand water, to which the Egyptians added the juice of the radish,[1277]\r\nconstituted a very common emetic. Opium was in general use even so\r\nearly, apparently, as the age of Homer,[1278] who seems to have\r\ncelebrated it under the name of nepenthè. The Spartan soldiers appear to\r\nhave made considerable use of the poppy-head;[1279] but whether for the\r\nsame purpose as the Rajpoots of modern India, I do not pretend to\r\ndetermine. Persons desirous of obtaining frightful and dismal\r\ndreams[1280] could always gratify their wishes by eating leaks or\r\nlentils, or the seeds of the great bind-weed,[1281] mixed with\r\ndorycnion. We may mention by the way, that the ancients understood well\r\nthe doctrine of the circulation of the blood.[1282]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1276:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. i. 157.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1277:\r\n\r\n  Συρμαία, Poll. i. 247.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1278:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. δ. 221.

As far, indeed, as the former process is\r\nconcerned, no machinery can rival the human hand, which, from its slight\r\noily exudation[1283] is enabled to communicate superior strength and\r\nevenness to the finest threads. Thus in Hindustân muslins were formerly\r\nproduced, which, laid on the grass and wetted by dew, became\r\ninvisible.[1284] And there is no reason for doubting that the produce of\r\nancient Greek looms rivalled those of Dakka. The fabrics of Cos[1285]\r\nand Tarentum appear, in fact, from the testimony of the ancients, to\r\nhave floated like a snowy mist around the female form, disclosing its\r\nwhole contour like a gauze veil.[1286] In flowered and variegated\r\ntissues,[1287] too, they attained extraordinary excellence. The finest\r\nand most brilliant shot stuffs imitating the breast of the dove,\r\nflowered cloth of gold, and the weaving of gold wire itself, were known\r\nto the ancients. Silk, before that of China[1288] was common in the\r\nwest, they obtained from the beard of a sea shell; and lawn and cambric\r\nand open work, like Brussels or Valenciennes lace, were familiar to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1283:\r\n\r\n  The whole of the manufacture in India is by hand-spinning,\r\n  consequently there is a greater tension, from the moisture which the\r\n  hand gives them, than can be had from anything in the shape of\r\n  machinery; a fine yarn can be produced by hand-spinning “from a short\r\n  staple, which frame-spinning will not touch at all.” Report from the\r\n  Lords, July 8, 1830, p. 316.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1284:\r\n\r\n  Tavernier relates, “that the ambassador of Shah Sefi, on his return\r\n  from India, presented his master with a cocoa-nut, set with jewels,\r\n  containing a muslin turban, sixty covits, or thirty English yards, in\r\n  length, so exquisitely fine, that it could scarcely be felt by the\r\n  touch.” The Hindoos, vol. i. p. 188.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1285:\r\n\r\n  Winkel.

But\r\nspiders were not long the only weavers among the Hellenes, who speedily\r\ninvented the upright and horizontal looms, which, in after times at\r\nleast, were constructed from the wood of the andrachnè.[1290]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1289:\r\n\r\n  Goguet, i. 266.

The flax, from which the fine linen and\r\nhead-nets[1292] of this town were made, was not grown in the\r\nneighbourhood, but in the plains of Elis,[1293] where alone, in Greece,\r\nthe plant attained the highest degree of perfection, not yielding in\r\nfineness to the best produced in India, while it was possessed of\r\nsuperior whiteness.[1294] The fine cloths manufactured from it sold for\r\ntheir weight in gold.[1295] Another species of very fine flax was\r\ncultivated in the island of Amorgos,[1296] where were likewise\r\nmanufactured linens of the most beautiful texture, frequently dyed\r\npurple, on which account the word Amorgis[1297] has sometimes been\r\nsupposed to denote a purple stuff, though the fabrics of the island were\r\nas often white as of any other colour.

It differed very little from\r\nflax, except in its superior height and thickness; and the fabrics\r\nmanufactured from it were not to be distinguished from linen, save by\r\nthe most experienced judges. From hair, too, they both wove and plaited\r\na variety of garments, among which would seem to have been a sort of\r\nmantle for ladies.[1300] Sacks, too, were manufactured from the same\r\nmaterials, together with socks, whips, and fishing-lines. The Egyptians,\r\nwe may observe by the way, wove fine cloths and sails, and made ropes,\r\nfrom the fibre of the papyrus plant,[1301] as the Indians did from a\r\nsort of grass or fine rush.[1302]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1299:\r\n\r\n  Poll. vii. 73.

As these insects, however, fed on the leaves\r\nof the pine, the ash, and the oak, the white mulberry not having been\r\nyet introduced into Greece, the silk they produced was very different in\r\nquality from that of China. The art of unwinding the cocoons and\r\nspinning the threads was invented by Pamphila, daughter of Plates,[1303]\r\nwho thus became the benefactress of her country, whose fabrics were\r\nuniversally admired for their delicacy, fineness, and transparency,\r\nsince they allowed the whole form and colour of the body to be\r\ndistinguished through them, like the gauze chemises worn by the Turkish\r\nladies in the recesses of the harem.[1304] Another kind of silk was\r\nmanufactured by the ancients from the floss-like beard of the pinna\r\nmarina, or silk-worm of the sea,[1305] found on the coasts of Asia\r\nMinor, Sicily, and the Balearic isles. This kind of silk was evidently,\r\nat one period, held in the highest estimation, since we find the\r\nemperors of Rome bestowing robes of it as a mark of their imperial\r\nfavour on the satraps of Armenia. In modern times, however, this branch\r\nof industry has been almost totally neglected, though very warm and\r\nbeautiful winter gloves and stockings are still manufactured from it at\r\nTarento. A pair of these gloves was considered of sufficient importance\r\nto be presented as a gift to Pope Benedict the Fourteenth.[1306]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1303:\r\n\r\n  Aristot. Hist.

They were variegated[1307] with\r\nstripes, lozenges, the figures of birds and other animals, sprigs,\r\nflowers,[1308] and stars,[1309] inwoven into their texture, and of the\r\nmost brilliant and beautiful colours.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1307:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Their flowered silks,\r\nand cloths of various colours, were worn, not only by ladies in their\r\ndresses, but occasionally, also, by vain young men, who thus exposed\r\nthemselves to the derision of the multitude. Bed-curtains, too, and the\r\nhangings of apartments[1310] were of variegated stuffs. In the\r\nmanufacturing of tapestry[1311] and drapery for the statues and temples\r\nof the gods, the greatest possible magnificence and beauty were\r\ndisplayed. Whole years were devoted to the production of a single piece,\r\nwhich exhibited views of landscapes and cities, together with figures of\r\ngods, and heroes, and groups of warriors, sometimes arranged in\r\nreligious processions, at other times engaged in battle, where the\r\nscene, the combatants, their armour, their weapons, and the flowing gore\r\nwere represented by various colours to the life.[1312] In the\r\nmanufacture of carpets, the Greeks displayed great taste and elegance,\r\nwhether we regard the figures of animals, trees, or flowers, with which\r\nthey were inwrought, or their pile, softness, and texture.[1313] Many\r\ntimes when they had not been flowered by the hand of the weaver, they\r\nwere adorned by the ladies themselves with sprigs, and leaves, and\r\nfigures, in embroidery; sometimes of various bright colours, at others\r\nwith threads of gold.[1314] Even napkins in Egypt were embroidered with\r\ngolden flowers,[1315] as both these and all kinds of handkerchiefs still\r\nare throughout the East. In Greece, the fine soft vests which\r\nwarriors[1316] wore beneath their shirts of mail were usually figured\r\nwith rich embroidery by the females of their family.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1310:\r\n\r\n  Casaub. ad Theoph.

It had been, we are told, a\r\n  long time in hand, and represented in one vast picture both the face\r\n  of the earth, and heaven with all its constellations. But it was never\r\n  completed, none of the succeeding sovereigns of Macedon possessing the\r\n  gorgeous taste of the son of Antigonos. Plut. Demet. § 41. Next\r\n  perhaps to this in curious workmanship may be reckoned that rich\r\n  mantle fifteen cubits in length, which the Sybarite Alcisthenes\r\n  exhibited on Mount Lacinium during the festival of Hera, which was\r\n  frequented by all the people of Italy. Dionysios, the elder, obtaining\r\n  possession of this garment, sold it to the Carthaginians for a hundred\r\n  and twenty talents. It was of a rich sea purple colour, and surrounded\r\n  on all sides by a border containing the figures of animals, the upper\r\n  row consisting of those of Susiana, the lower of those of Persia\r\n  Proper. In the middle appeared an assembly of the gods—Zeus, Hera,\r\n  Themis, Athena, Apollo, and Aphroditè. At either end stood a figure of\r\n  Alcisthenes himself with a representation, probably symbolical of the\r\n  city of Sybaris. All these figures were the produce of the loom, and\r\n  not of the needle. Aristot. de Mirab. Auscult. t. xvi. p. 199, seq.\r\n  Athen. xii. 58.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1315:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 116.

But at length the love\r\nof show and magnificence rose to so high a pitch, that robes were woven\r\nentirely of threads of gold.[1320] Ribbons also were manufactured of the\r\nsame materials, and several fragments of these fabrics have more than\r\nonce been discovered in cinerary urns at Rome, though the greediness of\r\nthe finder has almost invariably led to their being melted down.[1321]\r\nAt a later period stuffs were woven partly of silk or woollen and partly\r\nof gold.[1322]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1317:\r\n\r\n  By Beckmann, for example, History of Inventions, ii. 217, and\r\n  Salmasius, ad Vopisc. p. 394, and ad Tertull. de Pallio, p. 208.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1318:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Besides, we see in works of\r\nart representations of this kind of sock reaching nearly to the knees,\r\nand somewhat loose, which may probably therefore have been woven. But\r\nthe common sock, like the hat, was of felt,[1329] and usually\r\nwhite,[1330] fitting close to the foot and leg, and chiefly worn by\r\nwomen, with shoes or sandals,[1331] and sometimes in lieu of them,[1332]\r\nthough in some cases it occupied the same place in the costume of the\r\nGreeks as it does in modern times.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1328:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

The shoes already made, whether plain or gilded,[1334] used\r\nto be ranged on shelves fixed up against the wall with fanciful\r\nbrackets, while their lasts, pastepots, pincers, awls,[1335] and other\r\nimplements, were kept in armories, sometimes furnished with double\r\nfolding-doors, four or five deep shelves, and extremely elegant in\r\nform. Their cutting-boards[1336] were made from the wood of the wild\r\npear-tree which being of a close hard grain kept their knives\r\nconstantly in edge.

At Athens\r\nit was not fashionable in fine weather to wear a hat at all, chiefly,\r\nperhaps, because the practice was supposed to hasten the approach of\r\ngrey hairs;[1351] but in those seasons of the year when sudden showers\r\nwere looked for, cautious persons seldom went abroad without their\r\nbroad-brim, which being furnished with a long skin thong was suffered to\r\nfall back and hang over the shoulders. If they happened to be caught by\r\nthe rain when not thus provided, they threw, like Strepsiades in the\r\nClouds, a corner of their mantle over the head. These hats were of\r\nvarious shapes,[1352] and manufactured of very different materials;\r\nsometimes square or lozenge-formed, like our college-caps: sometimes\r\nround with broad leaf[1353] and low basinet crown; sometimes peaked atop\r\nwith rim curling all round like the bell of the Egyptian lotos. There\r\nwas another modification of the hat,[1354] fashioned like a\r\nlimpet-shell, and without a brim, chiefly worn by fishermen and poor\r\noperatives, and sometimes also by travellers.[1355]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1350:\r\n\r\n  Poll. vii. 171.

Winkelmann[1361] is not far\r\nwrong in supposing there were two kinds of purple, the one containing a\r\ntinge of violet, or sea-blue, produced at Tarentum,[1362] the other\r\nresembling our lake, known in antiquity as Tyrian dye. On the origin of\r\nthis colour the ancients had many legends (for they loved to build a\r\nmythos on what they could not explain), from among which we shall select\r\nthe most poetical. The Tyrian Heracles loved, they say, a nymph, who\r\ndwelt somewhere about the sea-coast, and her name, it is added, was\r\nTyros. In visiting this young lady, Heracles, according to the custom of\r\nthe heroic age, was accompanied by his dog, as we find Telemachos, in\r\nthe Odyssey. This same dog, not having love to support him, grew hungry\r\nby the way, and espying a purple fish upon a rock, with its head\r\nprotruding from the shell, he seized, and devoured it. On Heracles\r\nreaching the residence of the nymph, she observed the muzzle of the\r\nanimal dyed of a bright purple, and, in the style of a froward beauty,\r\ndeclared she would never again see her lover until he brought her a\r\ndress of that colour. Now this hero, as all the world knows, or may\r\nlearn from the comic poets, was always more remarkable for courage and\r\ngluttony than for invention. Love, however, on the present occasion,\r\nsharpened his wits. He discovered the fish, turned dyer, and, having\r\nproduced such an article as the lady required, had the honour of being\r\nesteemed the inventor of the Tyrian purple.[1363]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1360:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Gibbon, however,\r\n  considered the ancient purple very inferior to our own: “By the\r\n  discovery of cochineal, &c., we far surpass the colours of antiquity.\r\n  Their royal purple had a strong smell, and a dark cast, as deep as\r\n  bull’s blood—obscuritas rubens (says Cassiodorus, Var. i. 2,) nigredo\r\n  sanguinea.

They fastened, he\r\nobserves,[1364] a number of small bell-formed baskets, at regular\r\ndistances, to a long, stout, and tough cable, capable of resisting the\r\naction of the sea. These baskets, like the eel-traps of modern times,\r\nwere surrounded at the mouth with a circle of slender twigs[1365]\r\nprojecting inward, and almost meeting at the centre, resembling the\r\nbottom of a claret bottle, but with an opening through which the fish\r\ncould easily force its way in, though the twigs closing with a spring\r\nbehind it prevented its egress. To entice the prey, there was a bait in\r\nthe basket, which, according to some, was a cockle, according to others,\r\na frog, upon a hook,[1366] so that assurance was made doubly sure. All\r\nthings thus prepared, the fisherman conveyed the apparatus to a rocky\r\npart of the shore, where they let it down, having previously fastened to\r\nit a strong cord with a piece of cork at the end, that they might be\r\nable to discover and pull it up. Leaving their traps there all night and\r\nall the ensuing day, they generally took up the basket full. Then,\r\npounding both shell and flesh together, to prepare it for dyeing they\r\ncleansed away all impurities with water, and boiled the whole in a\r\ncauldron. The blood, being of an oily nature, melted on coming in\r\ncontact with the heat and acquired its rich colour. Not always did it\r\nassume the same tint, but was sometimes yellow, sometimes a deep violet,\r\nand, occasionally, some other shade. Into this whatever was dipped\r\nimmediately took the tincture of it. Nor did it all fade in the sun;\r\nbut, on the contrary, rejoiced in the rays of light, as it were, its\r\nbrightness imparting additional brilliance, and heightening the bloom\r\nand splendour of its tints.[1367]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1364:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Iris is denominated “purple;” we have mention,\r\nalso, of a “purple cloak, of a purple ball wherewith to play;” “purple\r\ncoverings,” of great beauty, for beds, or seats; “purple carpets;”\r\n“purple threads,” where the “sea-purple” is distinctly spoken of.[1370]\r\nAgain, in another part of the Odyssey, we find it said, that women wove\r\nthe “purple cloaks.”[1371] The President Goguet has entered into many\r\nuseful investigations respecting the manner in which the Tyrian dye was\r\nused; but at the outset confounds the _conchyliatæ vestes_ with the\r\npurple garments, though Pliny, on whom he chiefly relies, constantly\r\ndistinguishes them. The dye was obtained from several kinds of\r\nshell-fish[1372] found in the Mediterranean, the best on the island on\r\nwhich New Tyre was built.[1373] Aristotle, who of all the ancients has\r\nbest described the purple fish, observes, that there were several\r\nspecies, of which some were of considerable size, such as those caught\r\nnear Sigeion and Lecton; while those found on the coast of Caria and in\r\nthe Euripos were small. Generally, he says, such as inhabited bays or\r\narms of the sea were large and rough, and contained a liquid of blackish\r\nhue, though sometimes it was reddish, and small in quantity. Some of\r\nthese were a mina, or about seventeen ounces, in weight. Those caught\r\nclose along shores, or about headlands were usually of small size, but\r\nthe dye they yielded was of a ruddier tinge. In general, too, it was\r\nthought that those found on northern coasts produced a darker, those on\r\nsouthern coasts a ruddier dye.[1374] Purple fisheries were carried on on\r\nthe coast of Africa, near the island of Menninx, and on the shores of\r\nGetulia.[1375] So, likewise, in Europe,[1376] on the coast of\r\nLaconia,[1377] whose purple was greatly celebrated; in the Euripos, as\r\nwe have seen above;[1378] and in the terrible southern bend of Eubœa,\r\nbeneath the cliffs of Mount Caphareus.[1379] An inferior kind of purple\r\nwas obtained from the buccinum,[1380] but the genuine dye was produced\r\nby the _calchè_ alone. The colour was contained in a white vein about\r\nthe neck, the remainder of the fish being of no value. To secure, this,\r\nhowever, it was necessary to take the fish alive, for at its death the\r\ncolour fled. Having been carefully collected, and left to macerate in\r\nsalt[1381] during three days, it was mixed with a certain quantity of\r\nwater. The whole was then boiled for ten days in leaden boilers over a\r\nslow fire.[1382] After this the wool well washed, cleansed and properly\r\nprepared, was dipped into it. Here it was allowed to soak during five\r\nhours. It was then taken out, dried, carded, and thrown back, where it\r\nwas suffered to remain till it imbibed the whole of the dye.[1383] To\r\nthis double-dyed purple the poets often allude. Thus Horace:\r\n\r\n                              Te bis Afro\r\n                            Murice tinctæ\r\n                          Vestiunt Lanæ.[1384]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1368:\r\n\r\n  Exod. xxv. 4, sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1369:\r\n\r\n  Il. ζ. 219. θ. 221. ρ. 547.

Usually several kinds were mingled together;[1387] and to the\r\nmixture were added many other ingredients, as nitre, urine, water, salt,\r\nand the fucus—a kind of moss—by some writers supposed to be our\r\nargol,[1388] found in abundance on the rocky shores of Crete.[1389] The\r\ntint produced by this mixture resembled the colour of the\r\namethyst.[1390] For, under the word purple, the ancients included three\r\ndistinct colours,—the first a deep violet with a black or dusky tinge,\r\ndesigned by Homer, when he speaks of the “purple wave,” or of “purple\r\ndeath.” This was the amethystine shade spoken of as so magnificent by\r\nPliny; produced by the calchæ and buccina alone. The second which\r\nresembled deep scarlet or crimson, which is the colour of a ripe\r\npomegranate, was the purple of Tyre and Tarentum. The third was the deep\r\nblue of the Mediterranean sea, when it begins to be ruffled by the\r\nwinds; a variety produced by the buccinum alone, and always understood\r\nby the word conchyliata.[1391] Near the Isthmus of Darien, a sea-snail\r\nhas been discovered, which some have supposed to be the murex of the\r\nancients. In dimensions it is about equal to the bee. Being of extremely\r\nrare occurrence, the Indian fishermen preserve it, when found, in a\r\nvessel of water until they have collected a sufficient quantity for\r\ndyeing a piece of stuff. They then, like the ancient Tyrians, pound it\r\nshell and all with a smooth stone or something which serves them for a\r\nmortar, which as the shell is extremely thin and frail is a task of\r\nlittle labour, and immediately dip the cotton yarn or stuff in the\r\nliquor thus obtained. The colour resulting from this operation is the\r\nrichest purple that can be conceived, which instead of fading by being\r\npassed through water grows more lustrous and brilliant the more it is\r\nwashed. Stuffs dyed in this manner are, as may be supposed, exceedingly\r\ncostly, and on account of their beauty much coveted by the richest of\r\nthe Indian women.[1392]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1387:\r\n\r\n  The buccinum, for example, to give the ruddy hue.

Hist. Plant. iv. 6. 5. Another method of dyeing purple\r\n  prevailed in a district of Asia Minor, where the quality of the\r\n  springs would appear to have fixed the colour: “The waters of\r\n  Hierapolis were surprisingly attempered for tinging wool with a colour\r\n  from roots, rivalling the more costly purples; and were a principal\r\n  source of the riches of the place.” Chandler, i. p. 270. The learned\r\n  traveller, who is exceedingly sparing of his authorities, doubtless\r\n  based his relation on the following passage in Strabo: Ἔστι δὲ καὶ\r\n  πρὸς, βαφὴν ἐρίων θαυμαστῶς σύμμετρον τὸ κατὰ τὴν Ἱεράπολιν ὕδωρ, ὥστε\r\n  τὰ ἐκ τῶν ῥιζῶν βαπτόμενα ἐνάμιλλα εἶναι τοῖς ἐκ τῆς κόκκου καὶ ταῖς\r\n  ἁλουργέσιν. l. xiii. c. iv. t. iii. p. 158.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn dyeing scarlet, the ancients made use of kermes[1395] or cochineal,\r\nfound in several parts of Greece, but imported likewise from various\r\nother countries. It was sometimes employed in giving the ground to\r\npurple stuffs.[1396] Garments of this colour would appear to have been\r\nextremely rare among the Orientals, since the admiration excited in\r\nDarius by the scarlet cloak of Syloson, whom he saw walking in the great\r\nsquare of Memphis, can be accounted for only by supposing that he had\r\nnever beheld the like before;[1397] otherwise he would not have been so\r\ncaptivated by its magnificent colour as to press its wearer to sell it\r\nto him in the street. Syloson presented him the cloak as a gift; but\r\nafterwards, when Darius was king of Persia, he took care to proceed to\r\ncourt and make the circumstance known, upon which the generous prince\r\noverwhelmed him with his favours. This kind of dye appears to have been\r\nknown in Greece from the remotest antiquity, since Simonides supposes\r\nthat even the signal sail given by Ægeus to Theseus in his expedition to\r\nCrete was of a scarlet colour.[1398] Sardis was celebrated for its\r\nscarlet,[1399] whence the proverb,—to be dyed with the tincture of\r\nSardis,—for, to be beaten black and blue. The ancients, however,\r\ngenerally mistook the insect for the fruit of the holm-oak, upon whose\r\nleaves it feeds; a circumstance which may be regarded as very\r\nextraordinary, when it is remembered that both the insect and the tree\r\nwere daily under their eyes.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1394:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Dyes of every other colour were\r\nlikewise known to the ancients; as bright flame and saffron-colour,\r\npink, green, and russet grey;[1401] deep and sky-blue, produced by\r\nwoad;[1402] and red by madder.[1403] The Phrygian dyers made use of a\r\nkind of mineral[1404] obtained from Cappadocia; and wool was sometimes\r\ndyed with a decoction of beans.[1405] Among the Egyptians, linens,\r\nmuslins, and all kinds of cloths were painted with flowers and figures,\r\nin a great variety of colours;[1406] which was the case, also, among the\r\nMassagetæ, who impressed on their fine woollen cloths a multitude of\r\npatterns, which preserved their brilliance unfading to the last.[1407]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1400:\r\n\r\n  Virg.

Fisheries were accordingly established on nearly\r\nevery part of the coast of Hellas, as well as of those islands and\r\ndistant colonies of which she became mistress.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1416:\r\n\r\n  In the heads of certain fish, jewels are said to have been sometimes\r\n  found. Athen. iii. 70.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1417:\r\n\r\n  Strabo relates an excellent anecdote in illustration of this passion\r\n  of his countrymen. Speaking of the city of Iasos, situated in an\r\n  island of the same name on the coast of Caria, whose inhabitants drew\r\n  their chief subsistence from their maritime pursuits, and were\r\n  abundantly supplied with fish, he adds,—that once upon a time a\r\n  celebrated musician was performing in public before the inhabitants of\r\n  this city: suddenly the bell which announced the opening of the\r\n  fish-market was heard to sound. Away, in an instant, scampered the\r\n  Iasians, eager to secure their favourite dainty, all except a single\r\n  individual, who appeared to enjoy the performance of the citharador.\r\n  Flattered by this mark of his taste or politeness, the musician\r\n  approached the man, and said, “I am greatly obliged by the attention\r\n  you have shown me, and have to congratulate you on your love of the\r\n  art; for all the rest, as soon as they heard the bell ring, ran\r\n  away.”—“What then! has the bell rung?” inquired the apparent listener,\r\n  who happened to be deaf. “Yes,” answered the musician. “Then good luck\r\n  be with you!” cried the man, and rising hastily from his seat, he\r\n  rushed after his townsmen. Strab. xiv. 2. t. iii. p. 203, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus a celebrated lamprey[1418] fishery existed on the Faro of Messina,\r\nan eel-fishery at Syracuse,[1419] another for taking the purple fish, on\r\nthe eastern coast of Eubœa, a second on the shores of Laconia, a third\r\nat Sigæum in Asia Minor, and a fourth in the neighbourhood of Tyre and\r\nSidon.[1420] Whales and dolphins were caught in the Mediterranean, and\r\nin the Black Sea; thunnies in the same sea, on the Bosporos, in the sea\r\nof Marmora, in the Hellespont, in the Adriatic, and in nearly all the\r\neastern parts of the Mediterranean. Many kinds of smaller fish afforded\r\nemployment to numerous bodies of men in the gulfs and bays of Attica and\r\nthe Peloponnesos; and flourishing sponge-fisheries were carried on along\r\nthe coast of Crete, and in several other parts of the Archipelago.[1421]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1418:\r\n\r\n  The observations made by Spallanzani on the eel and lamprey fisheries\r\n  of Stromboli, may, with equal propriety perhaps, be applied to those\r\n  which are found along the roots of Ætna: “The fish here,” he says,\r\n  “are very plentiful and large, especially the sea-eels and murænas;\r\n  and, during my short stay in this island, I saw a greater quantity\r\n  taken than during the whole time of my continuance in all the Eolian\r\n  isles. They are, likewise, of an excellent taste. This abundance, I am\r\n  inclined to attribute to the volcano, which has continued incessantly\r\n  burning from time immemorial; and which, extending to an immense\r\n  depth, must necessarily communicate a part of its heat to the\r\n  submarine base of the mountain, and to the waters that surround it, in\r\n  the gentle warmth of which the fish find a more agreeable place of\r\n  resort, and perhaps propagate in greater numbers than elsewhere.”\r\n  Travels in the Two Sicilies, iv. 125.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1419:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

They made likewise the\r\nfirst step towards the invention of the diving-bell, by descending with\r\na large vessel turned upside down upon their heads, taking care that its\r\nedges sank into the water at the same instant, by which means they\r\ncarried along with them a quantity of air, and were enabled to continue\r\na considerable space of time beneath the surface.[1424] A diver and his\r\ndaughter are said to have performed good service for their country\r\nduring the Median war; for, descending into the sea during a tempest,\r\nthey loosened the anchors of many Persian vessels, and thus set them\r\nadrift to perish by the weather; in remembrance of which services, a\r\nstatue was erected to both father and daughter at Delphi.[1425]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1423:\r\n\r\n  Dutens, Origine des Découvertes, 145.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1424:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

Great numbers of smacks,[1426] of all dimensions, crowded the\r\nnarrow seas between the islands and the main, making sometimes pretty\r\nlong voyages, and taking passengers to augment their gains.[1427] These,\r\nmoreover, formed the principal nurseries for the Grecian navies,[1428]\r\nparticularly those of Athens, which consequently were manned, in the\r\nbetter ages of the republic, by the hardiest and most expert seamen in\r\nthe ancient world. They employed in their operations both the harpoon\r\nand various kinds of large nets;[1429] and the ease and rapidity with\r\nwhich they filled their vessels may be inferred from the accounts given\r\nin modern times of the vast shoals of fish of all species and dimensions\r\nwhich in spring time collect in the eastern extremity of the\r\nMediterranean, and pour in such multitudes into the narrow stream of the\r\nDardanelles and the Bosporos,[1430] that, with one sweep of a net, the\r\nfishermen are enabled to fill whole skiffs, while they may be taken by\r\nthe hand from the shores, killed like birds with stones, caught with\r\nunbaited hooks, or by the women in common baskets, let down by ropes\r\nfrom the windows of such houses in Constantinople[1431] as happen to\r\nstand on the beach. Elsewhere the fishermen made use of stop-nets in\r\nrivers or along the sea-coasts where the water for some way out was\r\nshallow. Various kinds of baskets,[1432] also, they had recourse to,\r\ntogether with the rod and line. Even that barbarous method, still in\r\nmany parts of Europe put in practice by the vulgar, of poisoning the\r\nwaters, was known to the Greeks, who, for this purpose, cast into\r\nstreams or ponds the pounded leaves of the Euphorbia Platyphylla.[1433]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1426:\r\n\r\n  Dion Chrysost. i. 220.

In\r\nthe paintings of Herculaneum,[1438] we find a landscape representing a\r\ngroup of fishermen immediately before day, when the dusky shadows are\r\nbeginning to be dispersed by the first straggling rays of light which\r\nbarely enable us to distinguish the boats, the nets, the rods, the\r\nfishermen themselves, and the picturesque shore on which they are at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1434:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Herod. i. 62.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1435:\r\n\r\n  Chandler supplies us with a picture of this kind of fishing as carried\r\n  on in modern Greece: “We embarked with a rougher sea than was\r\n  pleasing, and rowed out in the dark towards the island, intending to\r\n  fish. We joined our two seines, and the boats parted, moving each a\r\n  different way, a man letting the net gently down into the water. We\r\n  met again in the centre, when some embers which had been hidden, were\r\n  blown up and exposed on an iron grate, the flame was fed with cedar\r\n  dipped in oil, which blazing in the wind, brightened over the deep;\r\n  the red coals hissing as they fell, and were extinguished. At the same\r\n  time we began to clatter with wooden hammers on the sides and seats of\r\n  the wherries, to dash with a pole, and to throw stones, disturbing and\r\n  driving the fish, and darting a trident or spear if any appeared at\r\n  the top, dazzled by the light; sprinkling oil to render the surface\r\n  tranquil and pellucid. The men drew up the net with caution, fearing\r\n  the fins of some poisonous fish, particularly the scorpion, which is\r\n  killed with a blow on the head while entangled, when the danger\r\n  ceases. The boats meeting again, they untie the seines, and throwing\r\n  the fiery brands into the sea, proceed in the dark to some other\r\n  place. This is the common method of fishing in these seas.” Travels in\r\n  Greece and Asia Minor, ii. p. 198, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1436:\r\n\r\n  Quint. Smyrn.

Then letting down their long nets furnished with leaden\r\nweights to sink them, and with cords[1441] wherewith to draw them up,\r\nthey formed themselves into a semicircle, which rapidly narrowing round\r\nthe shoal drove them towards the land, by which means the greatest\r\nnumber were either taken in the nets, or speared by tridents.[1442]\r\nRespecting one of these fishing stations, on the coast of Cypros, a very\r\nromantic anecdote is related.[1443] The inhabitants we are told, having\r\nsculptured a marble lion, which they adorned with emerald eyes, set it\r\nup on the tomb of a prince of the country named Hermias,[1444] upon an\r\neminence overlooking the sea. The splendour of the emerald, penetrating\r\nthrough the waves, scared away the thunnies, which in truth are\r\nremarkable for their timidity, so that the fishermen of that part of the\r\nisland must unquestionably have been ruined had they not discovered the\r\nproperty of their lion’s optics, and substituted in lieu of the emerald,\r\neyes less terrible to the pusillanimous herds of Thetis. A circumstance\r\nalmost equally extraordinary is related of the strait by which the\r\nstream of the Bosporos disgorges itself into the Propontis. Here they\r\nsay a rock of marvellous whiteness is discovered on the Asiatic side\r\nthrough the waves in the neighbourhood of Chalcedon, which by its\r\nbrightness scares away the thunnies, both in their way to and from the\r\nBlack Sea. The ancient naturalists remark, that the thunny in this part\r\nof its migrations observes steadily one course, keeping generally on the\r\nAsiatic side in the ascent to the Pontus, where, excepting the seal and\r\nthe dolphin, nothing destructive to fish is found, and, after making the\r\ncircuit of its shores, returning to the Ægæan close along the coast of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1439:\r\n\r\n  Plin. ix. 20.

They who act as sentinels in the catching of the\r\n  sword-fish, take their station on a platform in the fishing boat\r\n  itself. “In the middle (of the bark) is fixed an upright pole,\r\n  seventeen feet high, with ladders to go up it, and a kind of round\r\n  platform at the top, for one of the crew, who acts as sentinel, to\r\n  stand on. This platform is called _fariere_.” Spallanzani, Travels in\r\n  the Two Sicilies, iv. 336.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1441:\r\n\r\n  Poll. i. 97.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1442:\r\n\r\n  Similar methods still prevail in the Mediterranean. “We had,” says\r\n  Chandler, “frequent opportunities (while at Genoa) of seeing the\r\n  method of fishing within the mole. Several seines are united and\r\n  extended so far as to form a large semicircle, but much curved at the\r\n  two extremities. The men then retire to some distance, and begin\r\n  clattering with sticks or hammers on the sides of their boats; the\r\n  noise making the fish rise. One stationed on the yard-arm of a ship,\r\n  takes notice which way they swim, and gives directions, until they are\r\n  within the net, when they are driven towards the ends, and are soon\r\n  entangled; or, trying from despair to leap over, fall on a wing, which\r\n  is fastened to long reeds, and kept floating horizontally on the\r\n  surface. The reward of much toil was, now and then a few mullet. The\r\n  thynnus, or thunny fish, was anciently and is now taken nearly in this\r\n  manner, but in shoals which endanger and often break the nets.”\r\n  Travels, &c., i. p. 6, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1443:\r\n\r\n  Plin.

Winkelm. ii. 93.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis proceeding they account for by supposing that, of its two dull\r\neyes, the right sees best, and that, in obedience to the guidance of\r\nthis peeper, it makes the circuit of the sea in the manner stated. A\r\nbetter reason may be, that its peculiar food[1445] is most plentiful on\r\nthe Asiatic coast in spring, and on the European in autumn, if, after\r\nall, we are to regard the fact itself as well established.[1446] In this\r\ntraject, however, it seems in reality, for some cause or another, to\r\nshun the vicinity of the City of the Blind, which constituted, perhaps,\r\none of the principal causes of its inferiority to Byzantium.\r\nNevertheless, a very delicate species of pelamys,[1447] caught there,\r\nwas known in the commerce of the ancient world, and transported to all\r\nparts of Greece.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1445:\r\n\r\n  Observations made on the habits of the swordfish may be thought to\r\n  give some colour to this relation of the ancient naturalists: “The\r\n  swordfish, we are told, is taken by the Messinese sailors in two ways;\r\n  that is, with the lance, and the palimadara, a kind of net with very\r\n  close meshes. This fishery begins about the middle of April, and\r\n  continues till the middle of September. From the middle of April to\r\n  the end of June it is carried on upon the coast of Calabria; and from\r\n  the end of June to the middle of September on that of Sicily. The\r\n  reason of this is, that, by the account of all the fishermen, the\r\n  swordfish, from April till June, entering by Faro, coasts the shore of\r\n  Calabria, without approaching that of Sicily; and passes the contrary\r\n  way from the end of July to the middle of September. We know not\r\n  whether it takes this contrary route for the sake of food, or from any\r\n  other cause; or whether it be the same fish that passes and repasses;\r\n  it is only certain that it does not coast the shore of Sicily but when\r\n  it goes to spawn.” Spallanzani, Travels in the Two Sicilies, iv. 331.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe have remarked above, that the taking of the thunny commenced in\r\nspring, when it appears to have been in excellent condition, and very\r\nhighly prized. During winter, whatever may have been its quality, it was\r\nnot to be caught, since it retired to the depths of the Ægæan, beyond\r\nthe reach of nets or tridents. In the heat of summer it was rendered\r\nlean and flabby by the persecution of a kind of worm, which, insinuating\r\nitself beneath the fins,[1448] harassed it incessantly. But, towards\r\nautumn, being delivered by nature from this pest, it again became plump,\r\nand was esteemed excellent eating. The growth of this fish is extremely\r\nrapid, more especially in the Black Sea, where, amid the vast quantities\r\nof mud and slime brought down by the numerous rivers, it finds in great\r\nabundance the food most congenial to its taste.[1449] The thunny,\r\nproperly so called, is at present[1450] scarce along the coast of\r\nMingrelia, where, by the ancients, it is said to have abounded, which\r\nrenders it not improbable, that they included under this name more than\r\none species of sturgeon, a fish still found in great numbers in those\r\nparts of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1446:\r\n\r\n  Plin.

A well-appointed and swift bark, putting to sea with\r\nher rowers, dashed out as rapidly as possible into deep water, upon\r\nwhich one of the crew, stationed at the stern, let down the tackle. This\r\nconsisted of two strong ropes, one on either side, to which were\r\nattached a number of small cords, each with a hook at the end, baited\r\nwith the Laconian purple fish, and garnished with a feather of the\r\nsea-mew, which, glancing hither and thither in the currents of the sea,\r\nassisted in attracting the eye of the pelamydes. The boat then traced\r\nvarious lines upon the surface of the deep, now skimming in this\r\ndirection, now in that, until it was followed by a shoal of fish, which,\r\ncoming up with it, voraciously gorged the baits until not a single hook\r\nwas left without its prey. Upon this the rowers desisted from their\r\ntoil, and, pulling up the ropes, generally found their boat laden with\r\nthe take.[1452]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1451:\r\n\r\n  Pallas supposes this fish to be the Mugil Cephalus, or mullet, from\r\n  the eggs of which Botargo is prepared.

Animal. xv. 11.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the thunny is taken on the coast of Chili may,\r\nperhaps, be worth mentioning for the sake of comparison. As soon as the\r\nIndians discover a shoal of these fish near the shore they put to sea on\r\nlarge sealskin floats inflated, like bladders, with air, carrying with\r\nthem a sharp-pronged trident, fastened to a tough and very long rope.\r\nThey then approach and pierce the fish, which, immediately upon being\r\nstruck, darts out to sea with prodigious celerity, the Indian,\r\nmeanwhile, rapidly uncoiling his rope till the strength of the thunny is\r\nspent through loss of blood, after which he draws back his prey, and,\r\nraising it upon his float, returns to the shore rejoicing.[1453]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1453:\r\n\r\n  Ovalle, i. 17. Baumgarten, i. 4. Aristot. Hist. Anim. iv. p, 109.\r\n  Plin. Nat. Hist. ix. 20, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, in this manner of fishing, the Indian draws near\r\nthe thunny while asleep,[1454] as we find to have been often the\r\npractice among the Greek fishermen, who when they went forth at night,\r\nat which time the thunny is exceedingly drowsy, were attracted towards\r\ntheir prey by the white belly of the fish sleeping quietly on the\r\nsurface of the water. Many other kinds of fish also appear to have been\r\ntaken while asleep, notwithstanding that in general their slumbers are\r\nbrief. Thus flat-fish, nestling in the sand or mud, were discovered\r\nthrough the transparent water, and pierced with the trident. So likewise\r\nthe sea-dog, the gilthead, and the mullet, were taken by day, with the\r\ntrident, while asleep; otherwise it has been thought they could scarcely\r\nbe touched by this instrument. The skate and other fishes of the\r\nSelachian tribe were sometimes found to sleep so soundly, that they\r\ncould be taken by the hand.[1455]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1454:\r\n\r\n  According to Oppian, however, most species of fish, like the Olympian\r\n  Zeus, refuse to submit to the chains of sleep, and keep their\r\n  intellectual faculties perpetually on the stretch. But the Scaros, he\r\n  allows, is occasionally caught napping. Halieut. ii. 656.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1455:\r\n\r\n  Aristot. Hist. Animal. iv. 10. p. 109.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn the shores of the Chelidonian isles there was a celebrated anthias\r\nfishery which was carried on in a peculiar manner. The fishermen putting\r\nto sea in their bark, and clad in garments of a sober colour, sailed\r\nbackward and forward daily in the same place and at the same hour. By\r\nthis means, the anthias, which in great numbers frequents that part of\r\nthe sea, became accustomed to the sight of the vessel, and by degrees\r\napproached it, one of the shoal generally preceding the rest. To him the\r\nfishermen threw out something of which the anthias is fond, and\r\ncontinued to do so until the fish became so tame that they would eat\r\nfood from his hand. A hook was then introduced into the bait, and as the\r\nfish crowded around the bark in prodigious multitudes, they were caught\r\nrapidly, and handed to a second person, who threw them into the bottom\r\nof the boat upon heaps of soft rags, lest by their bounding and\r\nstruggling they should make a noise and frighten away their companions.\r\nThe shadow of the boat assisted in concealing this manœuvre from the\r\nfish. It was considered necessary to spare the anthias which first\r\napproached, since, being probably a kind of leader, his disappearance\r\ninstantly put all the rest to flight.[1456] Sometimes it is said\r\nmultitudes of these fish were collected round the boat by the striking\r\nof two bits of wood together in the manner of castanets.[1457] The\r\nMilesians[1458] possessed close to their city a very lucrative fishery\r\nchiefly of the sea-dog,[1459] which there attained a larger size than\r\nanywhere else. This is supposed to have been owing to an extensive\r\nlagoon of fresh water, having however with the sea a channel of\r\ncommunication through which these fish found their way in, where they\r\ngrew tame and fat, and were taken in great numbers.[1460]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1456:\r\n\r\n  Plin.

It must\r\nbe interesting, therefore, to look\r\n\r\n              “O’er the dark backward and abysm of time,”\r\n\r\nat the first movements of men towards forging the links of this chain\r\nwhich binds together the whole human race in one society, disturbed\r\nsometimes by evil passions, but cohering nevertheless, and apparently\r\nbecoming more interfused daily.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1465:\r\n\r\n  The reader will find in the work of Monsieur F. Thiersch, De l’Etat\r\n  actuel de la Grèce, t. ii. p. 72, sqq., an interesting and instructive\r\n  chapter on the trade carried on by the descendants of that people\r\n  whose manners and customs I have undertaken to describe. He there\r\n  enters at length into the advantageous position of the country, and\r\n  the upright and honourable character of its inhabitants, of whose\r\n  singular probity he produces many proofs. Other writers have taken a\r\n  different view of the modern Greek character. But I am disposed to\r\n  place more reliance on the statement of M. Thiersch than on that of\r\n  those prejudiced travellers who desire to obtain a reputation for\r\n  exactness by an ill-natured interpretation of a free people whose\r\n  hospitality they have enjoyed, and in too many cases abused.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn this movement there were, doubtless, several nations that preceded\r\nthe Greeks. The civilisation of the East existing anterior to that of\r\nGreece, it was the Orientals who made the first step towards opening up\r\nthat intercourse which afterwards became so intimate between the\r\ninhabitants of Hellas and the Arabs of Phœnicia, the Egyptians, the\r\nPersians, and other nations of the East. At first, indeed, the\r\ncamel,[1466] that important instrument of human improvement, revealed to\r\nthe rude tribes bordering on Arabia, the existence of wants within them,\r\nof which they before knew nothing. He came with sweets and luxuries on\r\nhis back to the hamlet or the encampment, and by the sight of them\r\ncreated desires, to gratify which the aid of industry was to be called\r\nin. At a very early age strings of camels, laden with perfumes and\r\nspices, and gold, traversed the plains of western Asia, ascended and\r\ndescended along the Nile, penetrated the northern coasts of Africa, and,\r\nby barter and traffic, diffused the productions of the East much further\r\neven than their own footsteps reached, as now the manufactures of\r\nEngland find their way into the countries never beheld by an Englishman.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1466:\r\n\r\n  See a picture of this beast and his baskets, Antich. di Ercol. t. v.\r\n  p. 5. In the book of Genesis, chap. xxxvii. v. 25, we find a brief\r\n  picture of the commerce carried on by means of this animal, and an\r\n  enumeration of some of the principal commodities which he bore from\r\n  country to country. “And they (the sons of Jacob) sat down to eat\r\n  bread: and they lifted up their eyes, and looked, and, behold, a\r\n  company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing\r\n  spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPresently the blue and beautiful waters of the Mediterranean tempted the\r\nadventurous Arabs who had settled in Phœnicia, the country of the\r\npalm-tree, to launch their barks on it, and push from isle to isle till\r\nthey found themselves in Hellas, where the beauty of the women\r\noccasionally, perhaps, when they were not to be enticed away, may have\r\ntempted an adventurer[1467] to remain as other Arabs have done in every\r\nland whither they have wandered.[1468] This, I am persuaded, is all that\r\ncan be conceded to those who see so many proofs of Oriental colonies in\r\nGreece. But though the Orientals did not colonize Greece, they no doubt\r\naided very powerfully in civilizing it. For when the rude natives saw\r\nthat there were many desirable things to be obtained from the strangers\r\nif they could give them any thing valuable in return, it must have set\r\ntheir wits at work to invent new means of obtaining the things they\r\ncoveted. At the outset it was a rough system of barter. The Phœnicians\r\ntook the produce of the country in exchange for their merchandise, and\r\nsecured their own success by awakening an appetite for pleasures which\r\nthey alone could furnish.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1467:\r\n\r\n  This is, moreover, the common opinion. Thus Dionysios (Perieg. v. 907,\r\n  seq.)\r\n\r\n              —πρῶτοι νήεσσιν ἐπειρήσαντο θαλάσσης,\r\n              Πρῶτοι δ᾽ ἐμπορίης  ἁλιδινέος ἐμνήσαντο.\r\n\r\n              They first in ships the billowy ocean tried,\r\n              And first sea-wandering commerce gave to man.\r\n\r\n  On this account Cicero observes: “Eos primos mercatores mercibus suis\r\n  avaritiam, magnificentiam et inexplebiles cupiditates primum in\r\n  Græciam intulisse.” De Rep. fr. l. 111. ap. Feith, Antiq. Hom. ii. 10.\r\n  1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1468:\r\n\r\n  Some such event as this is no doubt alluded to in the story of Cadmos.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHowever, tradition has preserved evident traces of voyages of discovery\r\nand commercial adventure undertaken by the Greeks[1469] themselves, in\r\nimitation of the Phœnicians,—for, into this the Argonautic expedition,\r\nin what direction soever it proceeded, resolves itself, in fact. The\r\nGreeks possessed manufactures, ships, commerce, and, as a consequence,\r\nconsiderable wealth, long before the birth of history, a circumstance\r\nwhich goes far to overthrow the wild theories of certain modern scholars\r\nrespecting the Iliad and Odyssey; for, if the Greeks had constant\r\ndealings with nations who were indisputably in possession of the art of\r\nwriting, with abundant materials, they must have been the slowest and\r\nmost stupid of mankind if they neglected to imitate those nations.\r\nBesides, the Phœnicians would be as ready to supply them with paper,\r\nparchment, and whatever else they wrote on, as with any other articles\r\nof commerce, and must have desired to awaken in them the wish to consume\r\nwhat they were deeply interested in supplying. Thus, if the\r\nPhœnicians and Egyptians understood the art of writing, as from the\r\nsacred Scriptures we know they did, it is all but impossible that the\r\nGreeks should have remained ignorant of it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1469:\r\n\r\n  Apollodoros, recounting the exploits of the Argonauts, mentions\r\n  incidentally a curious particular respecting the women of Lemnos, who,\r\n  he says, were deserted by their husbands on account of the ill odour\r\n  they exhaled. Their places were supplied by female slaves from Thrace;\r\n  upon which, in revenge, they murdered all the men in the island, with\r\n  the exception of Thoas, who was saved by his daughter, Hypsipyle.\r\n  Biblioth. i. 9. 17. Cf. Pind. Pyth. iv. 159, sqq. ed. Dissen. whose\r\n  commentary may be consulted, t. ii. p. 235.\r\n\r\nHomer, of course, supplies the best account we can possess of Grecian\r\ncommerce in remote antiquity, though it had been carried on ages before\r\nhis time. Mariners, in the Odyssey, obtain the name of πρηκτῆρες, or\r\n“merchants,” and are elsewhere said to plough the seas, ἐπὶ πρῆξιν καὶ\r\nχρήματα,—“for traffic and gain.”[1470] The most celebrated mariners\r\nknown to Homer were the Phœnicians, whom he therefore terms,\r\n\r\n                              Ναυσίκλυτοι ἄνδρες\r\n          Τρῶκται, μυρί᾽ ἄγοντες ἀθύρματα νηῒ μελαίνῃ.[1471]\r\n\r\n                                Famous mariners,\r\n          Roguish, numerous trinkets bringing in black ships.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1470:\r\n\r\n  Odys. θ. 162. Hymn. in Apoll. 397.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1471:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. ο. 414, seq.\r\n\r\nThat from the beginning, moreover, they obtained celebrity for their\r\npiratical arts, the story of Eunæos, in the Odyssey, and the rape of Io,\r\nas related by Herodotus,[1472] clearly show. Nay, Thucydides himself, in\r\na recapitulation of the ancient history of Greece, observes that the\r\nislanders, chiefly Carians and Phœnicians, were no less renowned than\r\ntheir neighbours for piracy.[1473] The Phœnicians, however, would\r\nappear to have led the way, and, probably, by their successes excited\r\nthe emulation of the Carians, who drove them from the island, and\r\nadopted the business of piracy in their stead.[1474]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1472:\r\n\r\n  L. i. c. 2.

Namque Phocenses\r\n  exiguitate ac macie terræ coacti studiosius mare quam terras\r\n  exercuêre: piscando, mercando plerumque etiam latrocinio maris quod\r\n  illi temporibus gloriæ habebatur, vitam tolerabant.

Prim. p.\r\n  313, a list of the nations who anciently exercised the piratical art.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThough the value of the precious metals was already well understood,\r\nthey had not been adopted as the sole instruments of exchange; for, from\r\nthe often-cited passage of the Iliad,[1475] it is clear that the\r\npractice of barter still prevailed. The poet describes certain ships\r\narriving at the Grecian camp with a cargo of wine from Lemnos, on which\r\nthe chiefs and soldiers flock to the shore, and provide themselves with\r\nwhat they needed, some giving in exchange for it a quantity of brass,\r\niron, skins; and others, oxen or slaves. Among the rustic population of\r\nGreece, if the poets may be relied on, the system of barter prevailed\r\ndown to a very late period, since we find the goatherd, in\r\nTheocritus,[1476] giving a she-goat and a cheesecake for a pastoral cup.\r\nThe Spartans, too, after the death of Polydoros, purchased his palace\r\nfrom the widow for a certain number of oxen; whence it was afterwards\r\ncalled βοώνητα,[1477] or “bought with oxen,” unless the legend was\r\ninvented to account for the name. Pausanias, however, states as a reason\r\nfor the transaction, that neither gold nor silver money was yet in use,\r\nbut that things were disposed of after the ancient fashion of exchanging\r\ngoods for their value in some other article,—oxen, slaves, or gold or\r\nsilver in ingots. He adds, in illustration, that the Indians, even in\r\nhis age, were ignorant of the use of money, though abounding with the\r\nprecious metals, and used to barter their own manufactures for the\r\nmerchandise brought by the Greeks: besides, at Sparta, there was a law,\r\nattributed to Lycurgos, which prescribed barter in lieu of purchase and\r\nsale.[1478]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1475:\r\n\r\n  Il. η. 472, sqq.

Speaking of the exchange of\r\narmour, between Glaucos and Diomedes, the poet says:\r\n\r\n          Χρύσεα χαλκείων, ἑκατόμβοι ἐννεαβοίων.[1479]\r\n\r\n          Gold armour for brazen, a hundred-ox value for nine.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1479:\r\n\r\n  Il. ζ. 236.\r\n\r\nAn ancient scholiast on the passage understands by βοῦς a piece of\r\nmoney, stamped on one side with the figure of an ox, and on the other\r\nwith that of a king.[1480] But one of the scholia published by\r\nVilloison, observes on the word ἑκατόμβοια, “worth a hundred oxen, for\r\nthey did not as yet make use of money.” Another scholion,[1481] however,\r\nremarks, οἱ γὰρ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐν τοῖς ἐαυτῶν νομίσμασι βοῦν ἐνετύπουν.\r\nPollux[1482] relates the same fact, observing that, in remote antiquity,\r\nthe Athenians made use of a piece of money called βοῦς, because it had\r\nimpressed upon it the figure of an ox, and that, by many, Homer was\r\nsupposed to have alluded to this Attic coin in the verse above cited,\r\n“indocte,” however, as Heyne[1483] observes. Mention of a fine called\r\nδεκάβοιον occurred, according to Pollux, in the laws of Dracon; and in\r\nthe procession (θεωρία) to Delos, the herald used to proclaim when a\r\ncertain prize was given, that so many oxen were bestowed on such a one.\r\nThe value of the coin was two didrachmæ, so that the Bous was simply a\r\n_didrachma_.[1484] The ox was stamped by the Athenians on their coins as\r\nthe symbol of peace and abundance.[1485]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1480:\r\n\r\n  Ap.

Modern critics get over all difficulties\r\nin the usual way by pronouncing the passage spurious.[1489] No doubt the\r\npeople of those early times did not greatly abound in wealth, which,\r\narising from the assiduous cultivation of the useful arts, could not be\r\nplentiful where these arts were scarcely at all known. Even tyrants, who\r\nalways contrive to obtain their share of whatever riches exist in their\r\ncountry, were long after the Homeric age possessed of but little wealth,\r\nany more than their people.[1490] Money, however, does not constitute\r\nopulence. There was a rude plenty of all the necessaries of life, and as\r\nthe secret representative of wealth had not been invented, men sought to\r\npossess the realities,—herds of oxen, flocks of sheep, lands, houses,\r\nand splendid apparel. Fine studs of horses, also, were naturally\r\ndesired, being at once useful in war, and showy in peace.[1491]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1487:\r\n\r\n  Il. ι. 122. 264. σ. 507, sqq. Cf.

In several countries bordering upon the\r\nMediterranean, there was already great magnificence displayed. The kings\r\nof Midian, for example, wore purple garments, golden earrings, and\r\njewelled collars; their camels, moreover, were covered with costly\r\ntrimmings and ornaments of gold.[1492]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1492:\r\n\r\n  Judges, viii. 21, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf the internal commerce of Greece, in the earlier ages, little,\r\ncomparatively, is known. Goguet[1493] appears to suppose, that hardly\r\nany traffic can be carried on without the aid of sumpter animals, such\r\nas camels, mules, or asses. But the natives of Canara[1494] drive a\r\npretty thriving trade, though nearly every article of merchandise is\r\ntransported on men’s heads. In Greece, however, the use of vehicles was\r\nvery ancient, its origin being lost in fable.[1495] Boats, canoes, &c.,\r\ncame early into vogue also; and yet Thucydides relates, that the\r\nintercourse of the rural tribes of the Hellenes was for many ages so\r\nslight as scarcely to merit attention. Bad roads, the absence of inns,\r\nthe want of a police, the great number of robbers, were great obstacles;\r\nbut the very existence of robbers attests the fact, that attempts were\r\nconstantly made to extend inland commerce, though it may have been long\r\nbefore it was established on a solid basis.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1493:\r\n\r\n  Origine de Loix, t. iv. p. 204.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1494:\r\n\r\n  Buchanan, Journey through the Mysore, ii. p. 347.

Their history, as far\r\nas ancient fragments supply it, has been composed by a modern\r\nscholar[1496] of eminence, whose researches must prove of the utmost\r\nutility to all succeeding inquirers. This people, living on a small and\r\nnearly barren island, early directed their attention to the arts, to the\r\nvarious processes of industry, and to commerce, the only employment\r\nsuited to the nature of their soil. Too much stress has, perhaps, been\r\nlaid on the situation of Ægina, which will not at all explain the\r\ncommercial turn of its inhabitants, since Crete, with more abundant\r\nmeans, and possibly a better situation, was never very remarkable as a\r\ntrading country. However, poverty and a good position combined with the\r\ngenius of the people to render them commercial. They enjoyed still fewer\r\nadvantages in the matter of soil even than Attica; their lands were of\r\nlittle value; they could neither become hunters nor shepherds; nor could\r\neven the most slender population subsist on the produce of the mines.\r\nFishing they, probably, tried at the outset, as well as piracy, but,\r\nfinding that neither led to opulence, they adopted the mercantile life;\r\nfor which reason they have, with much ingenuity, been termed the\r\nPhœnicians of Greece,[1497] though no colonies from Phœnicia ever\r\nsettled in their island. The Æginetæ were already famous, however, from\r\nremote antiquity, as mariners, and, in the course of time, converted\r\ntheir whole island into an emporium.[1498]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1496:\r\n\r\n  Müller, in his Æginetica.

This writer relates, that, in the time of Pompos, king of\r\nArcadia, who flourished during the second century before the first\r\nOlympiad, Æginetan ships landed at Cyllenè, the great harbour of Elis,\r\nwhence they transported their merchandise, on strings of sumpter\r\nanimals, to Arcadia. The king was so much pleased with them on this\r\naccount, that he named his son Æginetes, in remembrance of their\r\ntraffic.[1499] It was about this period that the Greeks first began to\r\ntrade in their own bottoms, and to possess merchandise of their own. It\r\nhas been observed, that in Homer the word ἔμπορος never signifies\r\nmerchant, and that where mention of real merchants occurs they are\r\nalways barbarians, or semi-barbarians,[1500] Phœnicians, Cretans,\r\nTyrsenians, Lemnians, Taphians, or Phæacians.[1501] No Achaian or Argive\r\nis found who derived his subsistence from commerce, though there seem to\r\nbe passages from which the contrary may be inferred. But in Hesiod, who\r\nlived later, and describes more homely scenes and manners, we find\r\ncommerce already spoken of as a profitable employment.[1502]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1499:\r\n\r\n  Pausan. viii. 5. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1500:\r\n\r\n  Hom.

These worthy islanders, however, were impartial in\r\ntheir rapine. For, no sooner had they thrown off the yoke of the\r\nEpidaurians, than they made incursions[1503] into their mother country,\r\nwhich they soon extended to the coasts of Attica; and they were,\r\nprobably, the buccaneers against whom the tyrant Hippias fitted out a\r\nfleet.[1504] Afterwards, forming an alliance with the Thebans, they\r\nplundered and devastated all the maritime towns of Attica, and even lay\r\nin ambush to intercept the sacred galley on its way to Delos.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1503:\r\n\r\n  It was owing to such piratical descents that the early inhabitants of\r\n  Greece, for the most part, erected their towns and villages at some\r\n  distance from the sea-coast, in situations difficult of access.\r\n  Thucyd. § 7. Similar reasons have elsewhere led in modern times to\r\n  similar results. Thus, in Alicuda, the remotest and most exposed of\r\n  the Lipari islands, the dwellings of their simple natives and their\r\n  priests are perched high in the hills among rocks and steep\r\n  acclivities, through fear of the Barbary corsairs, who, from time to\r\n  time, land there, and carry away into captivity whomsoever they are\r\n  able to seize and subdue. Further, to guard against these incursions,\r\n  a sentinel is stationed on the Monte della Guardia, in the principal\r\n  isle, where he keeps watch day and night. Spallanzani, Travels in the\r\n  Two Sicilies, iv. 140, sqq. We have here a picture which carries back\r\n  the imagination to the most barbarous ages of Grecian history.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1504:\r\n\r\n  Æginetica, p. 76.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHaving been restored to their country, after the Peloponnesian war, they\r\nresumed their plundering habits, and obtained from the Spartan Ephori\r\npermission to infest the Attic coasts, which they frequently did in\r\ntimes of profound peace. Their taste for piracy was lasting. In the age\r\nof Demosthenes their island was a nest of pirates, and a fair for the\r\nsale of their plunder, which it continued for many centuries\r\nafter.[1505]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1505:\r\n\r\n  Demosth. de Nicostrat. § 3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nReverting, however, to the trade of Ægina: its ancient traffic with\r\nArcadia was marked by many curious circumstances. In the first place we\r\nmust infer from it, as the historian of the island remarks, the\r\nexistence of previous traffic elsewhere.[1506] For, if their merchandise\r\nconsisted merely of raw materials, these must still have been procured\r\nfrom other lands; and, if of manufactured goods, then, in addition to\r\nthe existence of a foreign trade to supply them with the raw articles,\r\nwe must suppose in them the existence of considerable skill. Again, as\r\nPompos, the Cypselid, probably reigned at Orchomenos, they must have\r\nbeen able to perform long voyages by sea, and long journeys by land;\r\nthough we can account for their taking the dangerous route round capes\r\nSkylleion and Malea, and the mountainous roads from Eleia to Arcadia, in\r\npreference to the shorter way from Corinthia or Argolis, only by\r\nsupposing them to have been driven to it by the rivalry of the Argives\r\nand Corinthians. It must be admitted to be honourable to their ingenuity\r\nthus to have opened up a road into Arcadia, which would seem to be shut\r\nout by nature from all commerce.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1506:\r\n\r\n  Æginetica, p. 77.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWith the Arcadians alone, however, could inland trade be carried on upon\r\na large scale; among every other Hellenic people possessing sea-coasts\r\nand harbours, it degenerated into mere peddling. Hence, the Æginetans\r\nobtained the character, once possessed in this country by the Scotch, of\r\nbeing a nation of pedlars—sometimes travelling from village to village,\r\nwith their packs; at other times settling, like the Maltese of the\r\npresent day, in towns on the coast of Greece, they became\r\ncorn-chandlers, vintners, toymen, or victuallers, in established shops\r\nor stalls in the agora. Hence, all kinds of humble wares, or pedlary,\r\nobtained the appellation of Æginetan wares. Like the Jews, too, both\r\nthey and the Cretans (noted liars, as St. Paul[1507] assures us) were\r\nregarded as skin-flints, and, in many cases, betook themselves to the\r\npractice of usury.[1508]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1507:\r\n\r\n  Epist. to Titus, i. 12, where he cites the testimony of Euripides,\r\n  though without naming him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1508:\r\n\r\n  Eustath. ad Il. β. p. 604.

Adag. 71, 72.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrequently, however, they soared above these petty arts, and became\r\nmerchants on a large scale, trading with distant lands and acquiring\r\nvery great wealth. The entire island, in Strabo’s time, was regarded as\r\nan emporium; and, even so far back as the age of Aristotle, their whole\r\nmarine was employed in commerce. In some cities, he says, nearly all the\r\nshipping is engaged in one kind of service; those of Byzantium and\r\nTarentum in the fisheries; those of Athens in war; those of Chios and\r\nÆgina as merchantmen; and those of Tenedos as transports.[1509] It has\r\nbeen conjectured, not without reason, that Sostratos, the son of\r\nLeodamos, celebrated by Herodotus for his riches, was a merchant. “The\r\nSamians,” says this historian, “induced by divine command to undertake\r\nthe voyage of Tartessos, brought home with them greater wealth (sixty\r\ntalents) than any other Greeks ever gained by trade, if we except\r\nSostratos, with whom no one can contend in opulence.[1510]”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1509:\r\n\r\n  Polit. iv. 4. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1510:\r\n\r\n  Herod. iv. 152. Cf. Bœckh, Pub. Econ. of Athens, i. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the Æginetans also engaged in foreign trade, sending ships to\r\nTartessos towards the west, and to the Black Sea towards the east. It is\r\nrelated, for example, that when Xerxes was at Abydos, he saw merchantmen\r\nsailing down the Dardanelles with corn for Ægina and the\r\nPeloponnesos,[1511] which were stopped by his fleet with the design of\r\ntaking both ships and men. But when Xerxes learned they were bound for\r\nGreece, he dismissed them, considering the corn as so much provision for\r\nhis own army, which, he doubted not, would be able to subjugate the\r\nwhole country. From which Müller conjectures, but without reason, that\r\nthe great corn markets of the Black Sea were at that time exclusively in\r\nthe hands of the Æginetans; though afterwards, during the Peloponnesian\r\nwar, when Ægina fell, they passed over to the Athenians. The reason\r\n“that the Æginetans stood so much in need of the supply, that they would\r\nnot have endured a rival,” could only hold good if they had the power to\r\ncommand a monopoly, which, for any length of time at least, is highly\r\nimprobable, since although they are said to have been masters of the sea\r\nabout the age of Darius Hystaspes,[1512] their domination was extremely\r\nshort-lived.[1513] It would seem, however, that they were at that time\r\nin the habit of supplying the Peloponnesos with grain. Slaves they\r\nimported both from Pontos and from Crete, and it is doubtful whence they\r\nobtained the greater number. A large proportion of their exports found\r\ntheir way into Crete, where they had established a colony at Cydonia.\r\nBesides lying one day’s sail distant from the Peloponnesos, and that of\r\na day and a night from Africa, this great island formed an excellent\r\nmidway station between Ægina and the mouth of the Nile.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1511:\r\n\r\n  Herod. vii. 147.

Gog. v. 302.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1513:\r\n\r\n  The jealousy excited in antiquity by the Æginetæ, was, in the\r\n  seventeenth century, inspired into all the maritime states of Europe\r\n  by the Dutch, who somewhat resembled those hardy and unscrupulous\r\n  islanders. Observe the ingenuous alarms of our countryman, Sir Josiah\r\n  Child, whose studies had evidently carried him beyond the\r\n  counting-house,—“I think no true Englishman will deny that the season\r\n  cries aloud to us to be up and doing, before our fields become\r\n  unoccupied, and before the Dutch get too much the whip-hand of us,\r\n  whom (in such a case, were they freed from their French fears which\r\n  they labour under at present) I fear we should find as severe\r\n  task-masters as ever the Athenians were to the lesser trading cities\r\n  of Greece.” Discourse of Trade, Preface, p. 39.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe port at which all the Greeks resided during their stay in Egypt was\r\nNaucratis in the Delta, which the Pharaohs granted them in the same way\r\nas the Chinese emperors now do Canton to the Europeans, as their only\r\nabode. Here, by permission of Amasis, such Greeks as merely traded with\r\nEgypt built altars and erected sacred enclosures in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe city, though I vainly sought, when on the spot, to discover the\r\nslightest trace of them. The nine cities of Ionians, Dorians, and\r\nÆolians erected at their common expense a sacred edifice, which they\r\ncalled Hellenion. The Ionian cities were Chios, Teos, Phocea and\r\nClazomenæ; the Dorian, Rhodes, Cnidos, Halicarnassos, and Phaselis; of\r\nthe Æolian, Mitylene only. The Æginetans raised for their own use a\r\ntemple to Zeus,—the Samians to Hera,—the Milesians to Apollo.[1514] At\r\nthis time, however, Naucratis was the only harbour in Egypt; and as this\r\nwas pretty generally known, ships making land anywhere else were\r\nnaturally suspected of being pirates; for which reason the captain was\r\nrequired to swear that he had come hither involuntarily. This done, he\r\nwas to steer from the Canopic mouth of the Nile; or, if the weather were\r\ncontrary, his cargo was conveyed round the Delta in barides to\r\nNaucratis, which the historian[1515] understood to be done for the\r\nbenefit of the foreign settlers, for so greatly, says he, was Naucratis\r\nhonoured. At this time, one of the principal articles exported into\r\nEgypt by the Greeks would appear to have been wine, since all then drunk\r\nin the country was foreign, the vine not having been as yet introduced.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1514:\r\n\r\n  Herod. ii. 178.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1515:\r\n\r\n  Hist. ii. 179. Müll. Æginet. p. 82.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf the trade of Sparta extremely little is known. In fact, until a\r\ncomparatively late period, it appears to have been inconsiderable, and\r\nto have been conducted in the rudest manner possible. Each citizen, on\r\nreceiving the proceeds of his lands, laid up in his storehouses what he\r\njudged sufficient for the consumption of the ensuing year, and disposed\r\nof the remainder in the Agora, not, it has been conjectured, for money,\r\nbut by the ancient manner of barter.[1516] It is said that the\r\nLacedæmonians exhibited much ingenuity in their mode of preserving the\r\nfruits of the earth; but in what that ingenuity consisted we are not\r\ninformed. They were likewise noted for the care and order with which the\r\nimplements of domestic economy were kept, so that everything was ready\r\nat hand when wanted.[1517] The fact that they had granaries on their\r\nestates, which were locked up and sealed, argues much greater connexion\r\nwith the country, than they are supposed to have maintained; for had\r\nthey never lived on those estates, it is not probable they would have\r\nleft their property there, subject, as Mr. Müller[1518] thinks, to the\r\nconscientious visits of every poor man who might choose to out-hunt his\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1516:\r\n\r\n  Müll.

Instit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1518:\r\n\r\n  Dorians, ii. 218.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMoney, we are incessantly told, was prohibited at Sparta; but,\r\nnevertheless, it seems to have been in constant use. It is affirmed,\r\nindeed, by a writer somewhat too prone to panegyric, that “it was\r\nemployed more often as a medium of comparison than of exchange; small\r\ncoins were chiefly used, and no value was attributed to the possession\r\nof large quantities.”[1519] But I do not see what is meant by employing\r\nmoney “as a medium of comparison;” and with regard to the value set on\r\nmoney by the Spartans, history incapacitates us for accepting the\r\ngenerous gloss of Mr. Müller. It is perhaps true that Lycurgos aimed at\r\neradicating avarice from the Spartan breast, but, in the means to be\r\nadopted for that end, only showed his ignorance of human nature; since,\r\nthough he might bring his vinegar-cooled iron medium of comparison into\r\ncontempt, he could not thereby diminish the value of the things\r\nexchanged, that is of real wealth, which accordingly was estimated as\r\nhighly at Sparta as elsewhere. Thus we see that poor men, not able to\r\ncontribute their quota of provisions, were excluded from the common\r\ntables, which therefore resembled the hospitality and common tables of\r\nan inn,[1520]\r\n\r\n             Where the Red Lion staring o’er the way,\r\n             Invites each passing stranger—_that can pay_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1519:\r\n\r\n  Müll.

Aristot. Polit. ii. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe learned, with all their leaning towards scepticism, sometimes\r\ninterpret too literally the language of authors in whom license and\r\nexaggeration are a merit. Thus Bœckh[1521] conceives “that, even in the\r\ntime of the Trojan war, the precious metals were well known in the\r\nPeloponnesos,” because Homer describes Menelaus as possessed of both\r\ngold and silver.[1522] But the Achæan prince had travelled in the East,\r\nwhence, according to the poet, he brought his gold, and it does not\r\nappear historically that the precious metals were “well known,” which\r\nextensive use only could render them, till some ages after the Trojan\r\nwar. The Dorians, however, whatever may have been the case with the\r\nAchæans, long continued to be scantily supplied with the precious\r\nmetals, which may be accounted for from their isolated mountainous\r\ncountry, want of industry, and aversion for all intercourse with\r\nstrangers, without adopting the unphilosophical fancy, that they were\r\ninstigated by a kind of argyrophobia strictly to prohibit the use of\r\ngold and silver.[1523] Conceiving that, by cutting his people off from\r\nhuman intercourse, he might render them more warlike, as dogs are made\r\nsavage by chaining, Lycurgos, or whoever was the author of the Spartan\r\nconstitution, may have desired to keep them poor, and therefore have\r\nprohibited commerce. But even in their own domestic traffic, the\r\nnecessity of some instrument of exchange was soon perceived, and\r\niron[1524] being as plentiful as gold and silver were scarce, he adopted\r\nthe expedient of employing iron money. At first the metal was used in\r\nbars or spits (ὀβελοὶ, ὀβελίσκοι) which were stamped with some mark in\r\nthe furnaces of Laconia, just as in other countries bars of silver or\r\ncopper were used; “whence the obolos or _spit_ and the drachma or\r\n_handful_ received their names.”[1525]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1521:\r\n\r\n  Econ. of Athen. ii. 385.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1522:\r\n\r\n  Od. δ. 80, sqq. 351, sqq.

Mr. Müller observes, but I know not on what authority,\r\nthat the chief coin was called from its _shape_, and perhaps also from\r\nits _size_, πέλανορ, the cake used in sacrifices. If this was the case\r\nit must have been a coin of extraordinary conformation, for the\r\n_pelanos_ resembled, in figure, a bull, horns and all,[1526] and was\r\nhabitually offered to Apollo, Artemis, the Moon, and Hecatè. This\r\nodd-looking piece of money was in value about four chalci or hemioboloi,\r\nthat is, about three farthings. But such an unwieldy coinage, which, as\r\ntokens, might serve very well for the home currency, would be of no\r\nservice abroad; so that when Sparta began to aim at foreign conquest, it\r\nfound it necessary to set aside the ancient laws, and create a currency\r\nfor effecting its purpose. A tribute was therefore imposed on the\r\nislands, and a contribution of a tenth was demanded from all those\r\nGreeks who acknowledged its supremacy.[1527]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1526:\r\n\r\n  Pollux. vi. 76.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1527:\r\n\r\n  Bœckh, ii. 387. Without such a currency, Sparta, says Mr. Müller,\r\n  would have been unable to send ambassadors to foreign states, or to\r\n  take foreign mercenaries into pay. ii. 220.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, to have been intended by the legislator, that\r\nindividuals should not possess gold and silver money; but the severity\r\nof the punishment[1528] awarded transgressors, instead of proving how\r\nstrong the hold of this ancient custom (of being without money) was upon\r\nthe Spartan mind, shows the direct contrary, for there is no necessity\r\nto be severe with men who obey from habit, but with those who evince a\r\ndisposition to break through all restraint. Besides, the law seems to\r\nhave permitted the use of the precious metals when wrought into\r\nornaments or articles of furniture. Offerings of gold, such as the stars\r\nof the Dioscuri, were dedicated by the state at Delphi, and statues of\r\ngold and ivory, the works of native artists, were set up within the city\r\nabout the period of the Persian war.[1529] A hundred years earlier, when\r\nthe state desired to gild the face of Apollo, at Thornax, they travelled\r\nas far as Lydia[1530] in search of the necessary gold, which wholly\r\ndisproves the assumption of Bœckh mentioned above.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1528:\r\n\r\n  See the remarks of Monsieur Bitaubè, in his “Dissertation sur La\r\n  Richesse de Sparte.” Nouveaux Mémoires de l’Acad.

For Sparta, unquestionably, carried on some\r\ncommerce, which it could not have done without possessing a coinage of\r\nuniversal currency; though Mr. Müller is not authorized to state, as he\r\ndoes, that there was a constant export of corn from Laconia and Arcadia\r\ndownwards to the coast of Corinth, since the passage in\r\nThucydides,[1531] on which he relies, merely relates in the words of the\r\nCorinthians, that unless they joined in the war against Athens in aid of\r\nthe maritime states, they would find no market for the produce of their\r\nlands, (including corn, no doubt,) nor would they be able to import what\r\nthey might stand in need of from abroad.[1532] However, so far back as\r\nthe Persian war, the Peloponnesos did not produce corn sufficient for\r\nhome consumption, since we find it importing it from the countries of\r\nthe Black Sea. It is, therefore, extremely improbable that it should\r\nhave done so in the time of the Peloponnesian war, when it had grown far\r\nmore populous, so that possibly among the things which ἡ θάλασση τῇ\r\nἠπείρῳ δίδωσι corn may have been included.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1531:\r\n\r\n  Book i. ch. iv. § 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1532:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. i. 120.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that Sparta both exported and imported; but who\r\nwere the agents? The state, which alone it is supposed possessed an\r\navailable instrument of exchange, could not, it is argued, have carried\r\non the trade. But wherefore? “Because it would have required a\r\nproportionate number of public officers.”[1533] Those officers, however,\r\nmight easily have been found, and, therefore, this is no reason; and\r\nthat no such officers existed, our knowledge of the government is too\r\nscanty to enable us to affirm. Accordingly, it does not follow from this\r\nthat the trade “was in the hands of the Periœci.” However, if such was\r\nthe case, the possession of a gold and silver coinage must have been\r\npermitted to them, which at once places the great majority of the free\r\ninhabitants of Laconia in precisely the same condition as other nations\r\nin this respect. Admitting this, it will be difficult to believe that\r\ntheir neighbours and acquaintances, the military and ruling class, would\r\nabstain from what they enjoyed. In fact, we cannot consent to believe,\r\nthat such a state of things “could not have had much influence on the\r\nSpartans, since they had not any personal connexion with the Periœci,\r\nthe latter being only tributary to the state.” The reverse of all this\r\nis true, as any one might know without any other testimony than his own\r\nexperience. Our countrymen in India occupy the same position as the\r\nDorians in the Peloponnesos, and for a short time kept much aloof from\r\nthe natives. But personal intercourse became inevitable, and it would\r\nnow be absurd to say, that the wealth of the Hindûs would exercise\r\nlittle influence on the English, supposing the latter to be poor and\r\nproud as the Spartans. The fact of the Periœci being tributary, which\r\nseems to be offered as a reason, is no reason at all. It were far better\r\nto confess our ignorance at once, than by a series of groundless\r\nconjectures, put forward with confidence, to create a semblance of\r\nknowledge. There does not appear to be any foundation for the statement,\r\nthat none but iron money was used in the Spartan market, where the\r\nlandlords and their serfs disposed of the produce of their lands. On the\r\ncontrary, it seems probable, that as, in many cases, it must have been\r\nsold to the Periœci for exportation, (foreigners being excluded,) the\r\nlandlords would receive gold and silver unminted, perhaps, to evade the\r\nlaw in return. Again, the kings of Sparta, it is evident, could possess\r\ngold and silver. This, history proves so clearly that Mr. Müller is\r\nconstrained to confess it. And if the kings and the Periœci, nay, even\r\nthe very Helots could amass and enjoy the precious metals, and the\r\nluxuries they purchase, it is too much to suppose that the masters of\r\nthe kings, of the Periœci and all, would have dwelt in ascetic\r\nforbearance in the midst of so many temptations. Besides, we constantly\r\nfind the Spartans in situations in which their iron money could be of no\r\nservice to them. What, for example, could it have availed them at\r\nOlympia? Yet there they were, the men in person, the women by proxy,\r\nwith their horses and their chariots, and every mark and indication of\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1533:\r\n\r\n  Müller, iii. ch. x. § 10.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut to men travelling beyond the borders money was allowed. This sum\r\nthey might expend, or they might not. If they did not, were they\r\nsearched on their return, and the surplus taken from them? Otherwise men\r\nwould make journeys and accumulate cash in that way. Again, we are told,\r\nthat great obstacles were placed in the way of foreign travel by the\r\nnecessity of obtaining a passport along with the travelling expenses\r\n(ἐφόδια) from the magistrates or the king, and reference is made to\r\nHerodotus. But that historian in the passage referred to is speaking of\r\nking Demaratos, who being driven from the country by his mother’s bad\r\ncharacter, takes what money he needs for his journey, and departs\r\nwithout asking leave of any one.[1534]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1534:\r\n\r\n  Herod. vi. 70.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHowever, when straitened in circumstances individuals had sometimes\r\nrecourse to the kings or to the state as to a bank; and that the thing\r\nwas customary appears from the fact, that princes, in order to start\r\nwith a popular measure, always upon their accession remitted the debts\r\nof the citizens both to themselves and to the state.[1535] On this\r\noccasion they destroyed all the bonds or instruments of mortgage\r\n(κλάρια), bringing them into the agora, and there piling them up into a\r\nheap and setting them on fire.[1536]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1535:\r\n\r\n  Id. vi. 69.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1536:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Agis, § 13. But this was at a late period, when rich men and\r\n  usurers had monopolised all the wealth of Sparta.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is certain, therefore, and admitted even by Mr. Müller, that whatever\r\nmay have been the intention of the original Spartan institutions, their\r\nseverity was soon relaxed, and wealth with all its concomitants,\r\nintroduced into the state. Even so far back as the ages before the\r\nPersian war, as we learn from the speech of Leutychides,[1537] at\r\nAthens, foreigners found no obstacle to prevent their bringing gold and\r\nsilver to Sparta, where one of the most distinguished citizens undertook\r\nthe keeping of a rich Milesian’s money, whose children he afterwards\r\nendeavoured to defraud. Could he have made no use of this money he would\r\nscarcely have desired to retain it. The share of the plunder accruing to\r\nSparta in the Persian war was evidently not confined to the public\r\ncoffers, though we may possibly allow that the Persian subsidies went to\r\nthe defraying of national expenses.[1538] At all events certain it is\r\nthat Sparta, about the time of Socrates, was by many regarded as the\r\nwealthiest state in Greece, and that not as a community, but\r\nindividually, reckoning their estates in Messenia, the number of their\r\nslaves, Helots and others, their splendid studs, and vast droves of\r\ncattle. Nay, their wealth in gold and silver is particularly specified,\r\nwith the additional remark, that for many ages the precious metals had\r\nbeen flowing into that country, both from Grecian and barbarian\r\nsources,[1539] but that no one had ever seen any flow out, an\r\nobservation which Montesquieu,[1540] and others have applied without\r\nreflection, to Hindústân.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1537:\r\n\r\n  Herod, vi. 86.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1538:\r\n\r\n  Müller, l. iii. ch. x. § 11.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1539:\r\n\r\n  Plat.

On the subject of Spartan wealth,\r\n  however, it perfectly agrees with Plato’s own opinion in the Hippias,\r\n  t. v. p. 414. Cf. Bitaubè, Sur la Richesse de Sparte. Nouveaux\r\n  Mémoires de l’Académie Royale des Sciences et des Belles Lettres, de\r\n  Berlin, xxxvii. 559.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1540:\r\n\r\n  Esprit des Loix, xxi. 12.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt exceeds our faith in human nature to believe, with Mr. Müller, that,\r\nin spite of these untoward circumstances, “the citizens maintained the\r\nsame proud indigence.” History, in fact, renders inexcusable the belief\r\nin such virtue, though men occasionally arose at Sparta, as well as at\r\nAthens and elsewhere, who, with a stoical firmness, resisted the\r\nallurements of riches and pleasure. The greater number fell, and yielded\r\nthemselves up with so much enthusiasm to the pursuit of gain, adding\r\nacre to acre and gold to gold, that from the Ephoralty of Epitadeus\r\ndownwards, the city was infested with usurers, great capitalists, and\r\nextensive landed proprietors, who, by degrees, got into their hands the\r\nwhole property of the country. Much less ingenuity than the Spartans\r\npossessed would, in fact, have enabled them to evade the old law, which\r\nseems to have immediately grown obsolete when the arts of rendering it\r\npowerless had been invented. They deposited their surplus wealth at\r\nDelphi, in Arcadia, and several other countries, so that if driven into\r\nexile,[1541] of which there was always a probability, they might be able\r\nto subsist in splendour in their new country.[1542] But these\r\nspeculations sometimes failed; in the case of the Arcadians, the\r\npossession of the gold converted bankers into enemies, as, by picking a\r\nquarrel with the owners, they hoped to be able to defraud them.[1543]\r\nLysander, though he did not commence this practice, at least\r\ncountenanced it by his example. Gylippos, inheriting from his family the\r\nthirst of gold, was condemned and starved to death, by the Ephori, for\r\npurloining public property. His father Cleandridas, in conjunction with\r\nking Pleistoanax, had accepted bribes from Pericles, and ended his days\r\nin exile.[1544] From this period, as seems to be undeniable, the\r\npossession of gold and silver by private individuals was permitted by\r\nlaw, or connived at; and the Spartans proceeded, after the manner of all\r\nother nations, to divide themselves into very rich and very poor, to\r\nhouse together, in the same city, misery and splendour, extreme luxury\r\nand extreme want, until the common fate, foreign conquest and slavery,\r\novertook them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1541:\r\n\r\n  This was thought necessary even by so great a man as Lysander.

Plut. Pericl. § 22. Müller, ii. 225.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe trade which, meanwhile, was carried on by Laconia must have been at\r\ntimes very considerable, though there were few points on the coast\r\nprovided with roadsteads, or harbours, capable of receiving ships of\r\nburden. To facilitate intercourse with foreign nations, an artificial\r\nharbour was constructed at Trinasos, around which the inhabitants of\r\nGythium, situated on an eminence some distance inland, gradually\r\nclustered, deserting their ancient residence for one more convenient and\r\nprofitable. From hence the productions of Laconia, which will be\r\nenumerated elsewhere, were shipped for foreign countries, Libya for\r\nexample, and Egypt, whence merchandise of various kinds were obtained in\r\nreturn. But, as this port appears to have been little commodious or\r\nsecure, the merchantmen, on their return from Africa, usually put into\r\nthe island of Cythera,[1545] where are several harbours, amongst which\r\nthat of St. Nicholas, anciently Scandeia,[1546] on the eastern coast, is\r\nsheltered and spacious, and provided with so narrow an entrance that it\r\nmay at pleasure be closed with a chain. The inhabitants of this island,\r\nlike those of the Laconian territories on the main, were free\r\nLacedæmonians, who appear to have directed their attention entirely to\r\ncommerce and agriculture, and the management of the productive purple\r\nfishery, carried on among the shoals and rocks encircling their\r\nisland.[1547] Besides its use in dyeing, this fish is said to have been\r\nemployed as a bait in taking the pelamys, and there was, likewise, in\r\nthis sea, a considerable whale fishery. The nerves of these leviathans,\r\nproperly prepared, were used in stringing the psaltery, and other\r\nmusical instruments, and also for bowstrings. It may, therefore, be\r\npresumed, that they formed an important article of commerce.[1548]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1545:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. iv. 53.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1546:\r\n\r\n  Pausan. iii. 23. 1.

At\r\nthe distance of a mile and a quarter from Scandia stood the city of\r\nCythera, with an Acropolis situated on a very high rock. At this place\r\nwas a temple of the celestial Aphroditè, esteemed one of the most\r\nancient in Greece,[1550] the inhabitants having addicted themselves to\r\nthe worship of this goddess, because, when she first sprang from the\r\nwaves, she is said to have come floating thither on a shell of\r\nmother-of-pearl.[1551] How many of the productions of this island passed\r\nannually into commerce cannot be known. But, it is described as\r\nabounding, in modern times, with wild asses, and deer, and hares, and\r\nquails, and turtle-doves,[1552] which last were, of old, sacred to the\r\ngoddess of the isle. Corn, also, and oil, and wine of excellent quality,\r\nwere found in Cythera, though by no means in abundance. It likewise\r\nproduces tragoriganon and bastard dittany. The island being thus\r\nproductive, it is by no means surprising that the Spartans should have\r\nset a high value on it, and sent thither, annually, a magistrate, named\r\nCytherodices, together with a garrison of heavy-armed men. Another\r\nadvantage which Sparta derived from the possession of this island was,\r\nthat it served it as a kind of defence against the incursions of\r\npirates, commanding, in some sort, the narrow sea between Peloponnesos\r\nand Crete.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1549:\r\n\r\n  At least I find this notion in Dapper, Desc. de l’Arch. p. 375-378,\r\n  who observes “D’autres assurent qu’elle avoit été ainsi nommée à cause\r\n  du porphyre qu’on y trouve en abondance.” The name has with more\r\n  probability, however, been derived from the purple fish (Πορφύρα)\r\n  which abounds on the coast, ἐκαλεῖτο δὲ Πορφύρουσσα, διὰ τὸ κάλλος τὸ\r\n  παρὰ τῶν πορφυρῶν, ὡς Ἀριστοτέλης.

It\r\ndogged incessantly the heels of commerce, appearing on every sea and\r\npenetrating to every land whither industry betook itself for the\r\nacquisition of wealth. It may be said, indeed, to have been a kind of\r\nbastard brother of trade, both proceeding from the desire of gain.\r\nAgainst the masters of this craft the first war-galleys appear to have\r\nbeen fitted out in the Mediterranean. For, among the principal exploits\r\nof the half-fabulous king of Crete is enumerated his clearing the sea of\r\npirates, his object being to secure the transmission of his revenues\r\nfrom the smaller islands to the seat of empire. For, in old times, both\r\nthe Greeks and barbarians of the continent, inhabiting the sea-coast,\r\nand all those who dwelt in the islands, no sooner addicted themselves to\r\nnavigation, than they took to piracy, being led by their most powerful\r\nfellow-citizens, partly for their own advantage, and partly with a view\r\nof providing for the poor; and falling suddenly on unwalled cities, or\r\npeople dispersed in villages, they plundered the whole country, and thus\r\nchiefly procured themselves subsistence. Nor, in fact, was this sort of\r\nlife attended with disgrace, but with some degree of honour. Even in\r\nThucydides’ own time, many tribes of the continent gloried in their\r\npiratical skill, and from the ancient poets, he says, it was clear the\r\nsame feeling had always prevailed; for, the first question put to\r\nseamen, on their landing, was, whether they were pirates or not; and\r\nthis without the persons interrogated considering it to be any offence,\r\nor those who asked intending any.[1553] No idea of caste seems to have\r\nexisted. The reception of Pelops, who came with great wealth from Asia\r\ninto Peloponnesos, shows that riches, however acquired, were valued\r\nbefore both; for he might have been, and, probably, was, a pirate.[1554]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1553:\r\n\r\n  Hom. Odyss. γ. 312.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1554:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. i. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the interior, also, plundering expeditions were carried on by land,\r\nas on the borders of England or Scotland, and more anciently on the\r\nWelsh marshes. And up to the period of the Peloponnesian war, many Greek\r\nnations still continued to live after the ancient manner, as the Ozolian\r\nand Epicnemidian Locrians, the Ætolians, the Acarnanians, and other\r\nneighbouring tribes, of which their habit of wearing arms may be\r\nconsidered as a memento. To repress the ravages of these half-civilized\r\nraces was often an object of great concern to the Athenians, who, to\r\ncheck the cruises of the Opuntians, long accustomed to enrich themselves\r\nby plundering the coast of Eubœa during the Peloponnesian war, took and\r\nfortified the uninhabited island of Atalantè.[1555] Some ages before,\r\nthey had, under the conduct of Cimon, expelled from Scyros the piratical\r\nDolopians, who not only scoured the neighbouring seas, but even\r\nplundered such vessels as put into their harbour.[1556] Nothing,\r\nhowever, could extirpate the evil, which has always continued to be the\r\ncurse of those seas, sometimes denounced, sometimes encouraged, by the\r\nprinces of the neighbouring countries, who, like Philip of Macedon, find\r\nit convenient, according to the exigencies of their affairs, to make war\r\nupon the buccaneers, or to unite with them in pursuit of plunder.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1555:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. i. 151.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1556:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Cim. § 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf all the Doric states the most commercial was undoubtedly Corinth.\r\nThat, situated on the isthmus by which the Peloponnesos is united with\r\nthe rest of Greece, became very early an emporium, and rose to\r\nopulence[1557] and splendour; for whatever merchandise was transported\r\nfrom northern Greece into any of the states of the peninsula by land,\r\nnecessarily passed through this city, and paying, as was customary,\r\ntransit dues, tended greatly to enrich it. The same thing may be said of\r\nthe productions of the Peloponnesos, which, by this road, found their\r\nway into Hellas. Afterwards addicting themselves to navigation, the\r\nCorinthians, from their two ports of Lechæum and Cenchreæ,[1558] carried\r\non an extremely extensive commerce with Italy and the countries on the\r\nAdriatic on the one hand, and with Asia Minor[1559] and the islands on\r\nthe other; so that whatever articles of commerce are reckoned among the\r\nimports of Athens were likewise in a measure to be found at Corinth. The\r\naversion of the ancient mariners to double Cape Malea long secured its\r\ntrade to Corinth. There was a proverb[1560] which said, that whoever\r\nsailed round that redoubtable promontory must be unmindful of his\r\nfriends at home; and, in truth, the boisterous and contrary winds which\r\nstill encounter the mariner who passes from the Myrtoan to the Ionian\r\nsea might well appear terrible to the small craft of remote antiquity.\r\nTo avoid this dangerous navigation these barks themselves, together with\r\nthe merchandise they carried, were drawn across the isthmus, and\r\nlaunched again on the opposite sea. The project of Nero, therefore, who\r\ndesigned to open a canal at this place, would, if completed, have proved\r\nof the greatest service to the Corinthians, whose city might have\r\ncontinued to be enriched by it to the present day.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1557:\r\n\r\n  Luc.

These finding a speedy\r\nmarket for their goods, other tradesmen followed their example, so that\r\nat length assemblies, originating in religion, resembled prodigious\r\nfairs,[1563] whither every description of merchandise was conveyed for\r\nthe admiration and purchase of the pilgrims.[1564]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1563:\r\n\r\n  It is said, moreover, that Iphilos established a fair at Olympia,\r\n  together with the sacred games.

That this was the case in\r\nmany places we know. There was, for example, a monthly fair held at\r\nAleision,[1566] near Amphidolis in Eleia, on the mountain road from Elis\r\nto Olympia, to which all the peasants of the neighbourhood resorted.\r\nAmong the Romans smaller fairs or markets were held every nine days, and\r\nwere thence called nundinia.[1567] On these occasions the rustics\r\nintermitted their usual employment and repaired to the city, as well to\r\nfurnish themselves with what they needed, as to learn what new laws or\r\nregulations might have been promulgated in the interim.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1565:\r\n\r\n  Plat.

By this is meant, strange as it would seem, that\r\nthey sought to cut off all such intercourse. For, as Plutarch[1569]\r\nrelates in his Greek Questions, the people of Epidamnia living in the\r\nvicinity of the Illyrians, and observing, that such of their citizens as\r\nassociated with them grew corrupt, and fearing innovation, elected one\r\nof their chief citizens to conduct the necessary intercourse and the\r\nbarter which took place annually at a great fair.

It is an error shared by persons in other respects\r\nabove the vulgar, that a commercial people is necessarily sordid; and\r\nhence Napoleon considered it opprobrious to the English, that they are a\r\nnation, as he expressed it, of shopkeepers. There are some lessons in\r\nthe science of human nature that Napoleon had not learned, among which\r\nthis is one,—that the greatest, wisest, and most virtuous of mankind\r\nhave risen and flourished in trading communities, and been themselves in\r\nmany instances engaged in commerce. No country in the modern world has\r\nproduced men of more chivalrous honour or heroic disinterestedness than\r\nEngland; and in antiquity the Athenians, as a community and as\r\nindividuals, far outshone in wisdom, high-mindedness, and patriotism,\r\nevery other people with whom we could compare them. In one word, they\r\nwere the English of antiquity;—bold, adventurous, indefatigable people,\r\nequally renowned in trade, philosophy, and war. That they were less\r\nfortunate may be accounted for from their geographical position, lacking\r\nthe inestimable advantage which we enjoy in being seated on an island,—a\r\nmisfortune well understood by Pericles, who alludes to it in his first\r\noration for the war.[1570]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1570:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. i. 143. Bœckh, therefore, is certainly in error when he says,\r\n  that Attica enjoyed _all_ the advantages of insular position. Book i.\r\n  § 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNo country, however fertile, produces all that its inhabitants, when\r\nadvancing in civilisation, require, which tends more than any other\r\ncircumstance to promote the amelioration of society; and Attica, from\r\nits comparative barrenness and very limited extent, peculiarly\r\nexperienced the necessity of foreign commerce. To this accordingly the\r\nAthenians from a very early period applied themselves, and with so much\r\nsuccess, that whatever commodities the ancient world produced were\r\ngenerally to be found in the greatest abundance in their city.[1571]\r\nThey enjoyed as has been already observed, most of the advantages of\r\ninsular position, that is,[1572] excellent harbours conveniently\r\nsituated, in which they received supplies during all winds,[1573] and,\r\nin addition to these, some of the compensating advantages of being\r\nsituated on the continent, in facilities for inland traffic. Chief of\r\nall, however, were the blessings flowing from the wisdom, and\r\nmoderation, and liberality, of its government, which rendered Athens the\r\nresort of all the enterprising and enlightened men of every other\r\ncountry. Its dealings with foreigners were facilitated by the purity of\r\nthe coin, as the traders who did not choose to purchase merchandise\r\nmight take bullion, which, as Xenophon expresses it, was a very handsome\r\narticle, and of so little alloy as everywhere to pass for more than its\r\nnominal value, like the old Spanish dollars, and English gold currency\r\nin the East.[1574] Prohibitions to export money, as Bœckh observes, were\r\nunknown in ancient times, and are only compatible with bills of\r\nexchange.[1575]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1571:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

But she thus created a boundless market for her own exports,\r\nwhether consisting of manufactures or the surplus produce of the soil;\r\nand as we now retail to the Continental nations many productions of\r\nEastern Asia, so the Athenians disposed, in the uncommercial countries\r\naround, of the commodities they had elsewhere collected. For example,\r\nthey found a vent among the nations on the Black Sea for the wines of\r\nthe islands and shores of the Ægean, Peparethos, Cos, Thasos, Mendè,\r\nSkionè, Lemnos, and Crete.[1582] From a passage in Xenophon, it would\r\nappear either that Greek sailors amused themselves by reading on their\r\nvoyages, or that books were exported to Pontos, for there seems to be no\r\nfoundation for the suspicions that they were blank books.[1583] “Here,”\r\nsays Xenophon, speaking of the coast of Thrace, “are found numerous\r\nbeds, cabinets, books, and such other things as shipmasters are\r\naccustomed to transport in chests.”[1584] Theopompos represents the\r\nPersians as carrying books (χάρται βιβλίων) along with them in their\r\ninvasion of Egypt, and the Greeks could have been scarcely less\r\nliterary.[1585] Certain, at all events, it is, that there was a\r\nbook-market at Athens, probably resembling the bazars of the East, where\r\nthe dealers in manuscripts kept their shops;[1586] and thence, in all\r\nlikelihood, the Greek cities on the Black Sea were supplied; and this is\r\nby no means inconsistent with the proverb respecting Hermodoros, Plato’s\r\nSicilian publisher, who was said, contemptuously, to traffic in words;\r\nfor, as he himself was one of Plato’s hearers, it may have been thought\r\nbeneath him to turn trader.[1587] Somewhat later we read of Zeno, a\r\nstranger in the city, going into a bookseller’s shop to sit down, where\r\nhe finds the owner reading Xenophon, and is recommended by him to follow\r\nCrates.[1588]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1581:\r\n\r\n  Strab. ix. 1.

Numerous officers were appointed to watch over\r\nthe commercial dealings of the citizens; such as the superintendents of\r\nthe harbour, ten persons appointed annually by lot; the overseers of the\r\nmarket, likewise ten, of whom five superintended the markets in the\r\ncity, the other five, those in the Peiræeus; fifteen inspectors of\r\nweights and measures, ten of whom attended in the city, the other five\r\nthose in the port; and subordinate, probably, to these were the public\r\nmeters, who seem to have been Scythians, and therefore slaves of the\r\nstate: their duty was to measure whatever grain was sold in the\r\nmarket,[1589] for which was paid a small sum, applied, it may be\r\nsupposed, to the augmentation of the revenue. Great care, in fact, was\r\nbestowed on the subject of weights and measures, and to the market\r\nregulations generally; and yet we find from the comic poets[1590] that\r\nmuch fraud was occasionally committed.[1591]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1589:\r\n\r\n  Harpocrat. in v. προμετρητὴς; and see the note of Gronovius, p. 111,\r\n  seq.

Inscript. i. 164.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is, by some writers, supposed that credit was at a low ebb in Greece;\r\nbut this notion seems to have been formed hastily, without allowing for\r\ncircumstances, as the condition of the times sufficiently accounts for\r\nthe facts which suggested it; for all large and established houses are\r\nknown to have possessed almost unlimited credit, since they were able,\r\non the mere security of their name, to raise whatever money they needed;\r\nso that none, probably, but persons little known, or not known\r\nadvantageously, were required to give security.[1592] The inhabitants of\r\ncertain cities, as, for example, of Phaselis, enjoyed, as we say, a bad\r\nreputation,[1593] and were, no doubt, among those whom people refused to\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1592:\r\n\r\n  Vid. Bern. adv. Polycl. § 15. Compare Thiersch, Etat Actuel de la\r\n  Grèce, ii. 78, seq. 85.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1593:\r\n\r\n  See the opening of the speech against Lacritos (§ 1), where the orator\r\n  heaps his compliments unsparingly upon those “honest dealers,” whom he\r\n  describes as “the most unjust and villanous of mankind:” πονηρότατοι\r\n  ἀνθρώπων καὶ ἀδικώτατοι.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf severity, however, in the laws of debtor and creditor have any\r\ntendency to support credit, the confiding portion of the community had\r\nlittle reason to complain at Athens, since the spirit of this branch of\r\nAthenian jurisprudence was unusually stern. The man who obtained the\r\nloan of money and fraudulently withheld his security, was deemed to have\r\ncommitted a capital offence, nor could his high rank or honourable\r\nconnexions skreen him from punishment.[1594] For it was considered,\r\nobserves the orator, that an offender of this description not only\r\ndefrauded the individuals with whom he dealt, but also made an attempt\r\nagainst the sources of public prosperity, commercial operations\r\ndepending not on the borrower but on the lender, without whose\r\ncoöperation no ship, or captain, or passenger, can move. On which\r\naccount the most effective protection was afforded them by law.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1594:\r\n\r\n  Dem. in Phorm. § 17. Mr. Bœckh, if the English translation exactly\r\n  represents his meaning, understands this passage differently, and his\r\n  interpretation is more favourable to the Athenian law: “Even a\r\n  citizen, who, in his capacity of a merchant, _withdrew_ from a\r\n  creditor a pledge for a sum vested in bottomry, could be punished with\r\n  loss of life.” (Pub. Econ. of Athens, i. 69.) It may be doubted,\r\n  however, whether οὐ παρασχόντα τὰς ὑποθήκας can mean anything more\r\n  than “withholding the securities;” and I, therefore, suppose Bœckh’s\r\n  translators to have employed the verb “withdraw” for “withhold.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMerchants and sea-captains were also defended by very severe enactments\r\nagainst false accusers, who, upon conviction, were heavily fined, and,\r\nin default of payment, deprived of the rights of citizenship.[1595]\r\nCauses of this kind were tried in the Commercial Court of the Nautodikæ,\r\nwhich was also empowered to examine the claims of citizens accused of\r\nforeign extraction.[1596] The causes were introduced by the Thesmothetæ,\r\nand in lawsuits between citizens of different nations, by virtue of a\r\nparticular agreement, there existed an appeal from one state to the\r\nother.[1597] Nothing more clearly shows the consideration in which\r\nnautical and mercantile affairs were held at Athens, than the laws which\r\nregulated the proceedings of this court: in the first place, not to\r\ninterrupt the course of business and occasion loss to individuals, the\r\nNautodikæ sat during the winter months, from September till March, when\r\nnavigation was usually suspended. At first, indeed, they did not\r\ncommence their sittings till January;[1598] but this was found\r\ninconvenient, the decision of the court being frequently delayed till\r\nlate in the spring or summer, to the great loss and detriment of the\r\nlitigants. Consequences still more disastrous, perhaps, ensued when the\r\ncause stood over till the ensuing winter, when, as new judges would be\r\nappointed, the whole business had to be commenced _de novo_. To remedy\r\nthis evil a plan of reform was conceived by Xenophon,[1599] but with\r\nnothing like a statesman’s views, its chief merit consisting in\r\nproposing a prize to be awarded to the most able and expeditious judge.\r\nHis scheme, however, may have had the merit of fixing the attention of\r\nwiser men upon the subject, which at length produced the monthly suits\r\nto which belonged all causes concerning trade-clubs, dowries, and\r\nmines.[1600] Upon the introduction of this improvement in the practice\r\nof the commercial court the advantage proposed by Xenophon was fully\r\nobtained, since causes could not, as some have imagined, stand over from\r\nmonth to month, but must absolutely be decided within the term.[1601]\r\nThe more completely to protect and advance the interests of commerce,\r\neach state had its consul[1602] (προξένος) who represented the interests\r\nof his country, and, like our own consuls in the Levant, was bound to\r\nreceive and entertain such citizens as arrived at the port where he\r\nresided. Besides, when a merchant or trader died abroad, it was part of\r\nthe consul’s duty to take charge of his property, and transmit\r\nimmediately to his friends an account of what had taken place, with the\r\nnecessary particulars.[1603] Occasionally, however, very improper\r\npersons obtained this respectable and, no doubt, lucrative situation, as\r\nthe man Lycidas, formerly one of Chabrias’s slaves, who contrived, by\r\nintrigue, to be appointed consul of Messina; and Dionysios, a man of\r\nlike origin and character, and by birth a Megarean, who enjoyed the\r\nhonour of representing Athens at Megara.[1604]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1595:\r\n\r\n  Liban. arg. ad Orat. in Theocrin. t. viii. p. 334.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1596:\r\n\r\n  Poll. viii. 126.

Greece, c. x. p. 163.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBœckh remarks that, in the plan of Xenophon for restoring the revenue,\r\nno allusion is made to the removal of onerous restrictions on trade;\r\nfrom which it may be inferred that none such existed. Heeren[1606] is\r\nclearly of this opinion: “nothing was known of the balance of trade, and\r\nconsequently all the violent measures resulting from it were never\r\ndevised by the Greeks. They had duties as well as the moderns; but these\r\nduties were exacted only for the sake of increasing the public revenue,\r\nnot to direct the efforts of domestic industry by the prohibition of\r\ncertain wares. There was no prohibition of the exportation of the raw\r\nproduce; no encouragement of manufactures at the expense of the\r\nagriculturist. In this respect, therefore, there existed a freedom of\r\nindustry, commerce, and trade. And such was the general custom. As every\r\nthing was decided by circumstances, and not by theories, there may have\r\nbeen single exceptions, and perhaps single examples, where the state for\r\na season usurped a monopoly. But how far was this from the mercantile\r\nand restrictive system of the moderns!”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1606:\r\n\r\n  Polit. Hist. of Anc. Greece, c. x. p. 163.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis it appears to me is the philosophical view of the matter, which is\r\nnot modified materially by the remarks of Bœckh. No doubt the interests\r\nof the state were regarded as paramount, comprehending, as in just\r\nstates they do, the interests of all individuals; but for this very\r\nreason they would, to the best of their knowledge, beware of interfering\r\ncapriciously or unnecessarily with private interests, since a prosperous\r\ncommunity cannot be constituted of unprosperous members. Mr. Bœckh\r\nseems, with all his learning and acuteness, to misapprehend the\r\npolitical theory of the ancients, and to imagine that, because the right\r\nof governments to regulate the actions of individuals was recognized,\r\nthey might safely do so on all occasions without rhyme or reason. But in\r\nthis he is certainly in error. The object of government was understood\r\nthen as well as it is now; so that I am apt to think that the erudite\r\nprofessor advances, in the following passage, a doctrine which would\r\nhave met with but a cold reception among the Athenians, though adopted\r\nliterally by the historians of the Doric race: “Not in Crete and\r\nLacedæmon alone, two states completely closed up, and from their\r\nposition unsusceptible of free trade, but generally throughout the whole\r\nof Greece, and even under the free and republican government of Athens,\r\nthe poorest as well as the richest citizen was convinced that the state\r\nhad the right of claiming the whole property of every individual; any\r\nrestriction in the transfer of this property, regulated according to\r\ncircumstances, was looked upon as just, nor could it properly be\r\nconsidered an infringement of justice before the security of person and\r\nproperty was held to be the sole object of government; a light under\r\nwhich it never was viewed by any of the ancients.”[1607]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1607:\r\n\r\n  Public Economy of Athens, i. 72.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to select from any writer, ancient or modern, a\r\npassage more abounding than this with erroneous conclusions. Neither\r\nLacedæmon nor Crete was excluded by its position from the advantages of\r\nfree trade; and at Athens there was no citizen, however poor or\r\nignorant, who acknowledged in the state any such right as Mr. Bœckh\r\nspeaks of, except for the purpose of providing for the general safety,\r\nin which case it would be as cheerfully acknowledged in every modern\r\ncommunity. While penning the concluding sentence, Mr. Bœckh must have\r\nbeen thinking of the despotic governments of Germany. An Englishman\r\nconsiders the preservation of his political rights as much an object of\r\ngovernment as the protection of his person or his property, and would as\r\nstrenuously contend for it, in which feeling he resembles the Athenian.\r\nBut I will not permit even this theme to tempt me from the matter in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThere can be no difficulty in admitting that, as the very existence of\r\ncommerce, properly so called, depends on the existence of political\r\ncommunities, the state has a right to interfere, under certain\r\ncircumstances, with the movements of commerce. For example, merchants\r\nmay justly be prevented by the laws from furnishing their country’s\r\nenemy with arms, with ammunition, with provisions, in short, with any\r\narticle whatsoever, which, by strengthening the hands of the foe, may\r\ntend to the detriment of their own community. Again, in famines and\r\nscarcities, the law of self-preservation authorizes states to restrain\r\nthe exportation of articles absolutely required for home consumption;\r\nbecause distress produces discontent and tumult and insurrection, and\r\nmay thus endanger the very existence of the government itself.\r\nProhibitions to export, originating in such motives, are perfectly\r\ndefensible. But so much can scarcely be said for monopolies, which were\r\nnot unknown to the Greeks, though it is not denied that they were of\r\nshort duration.[1608] “It can, however, be safely asserted,” says Mr.\r\nBœckh, “that no republic ever demanded of its citizens that they should\r\nfurnish commodities to the state in specific quantities, and at prices\r\narbitrarily fixed at a low rate, with a view to secure to itself a\r\nmonopoly: such a demand could only have been enforced in countries under\r\nthe government of a tyrant.”[1609] The folly, as well as the wickedness,\r\nof such despotic interference, I witnessed in the depopulation and\r\nmisery of Egypt, which at length proceeded so far as to alarm the Pasha\r\nhimself, and produce some amelioration of his vicious system.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1608:\r\n\r\n  Aristot. Polit. i. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1609:\r\n\r\n  Pub. Econ. of Athens, i. 73.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is, no doubt, possible, that many monopolies of which we know nothing\r\nmay have existed in antiquity;[1610] but it will be quite evident that,\r\nupon such possibility, it would be useless to reason. The monopolies\r\nwhich we know to have existed were few, and of short duration.\r\nAristotle, while observing what advantages both individuals and states\r\nsometimes derived from them, attributes a better policy to Athens. He\r\ngives two or three examples of private monopolies, the well-known story\r\nof Thales and the oil-presses, and that of a man who bought up all the\r\niron[1611] at Syracuse, and adds, that, in great pecuniary straits,\r\ngovernments were sometimes found to imitate them.[1612] Thus, at a late\r\nperiod of their history, the Athenians are supposed to have monopolised\r\nthe lead obtained from the silver mines of Laureion, which they did, we\r\nare told, at the instigation of Pythoclos; that is, they bought it up at\r\nthe usual price of two drachmas the commercial talent, and sold it at\r\nsix drachmas.[1613] At Rome the price was higher. As there can be little\r\ndoubt that the lead was for exportation, no injury was inflicted on\r\nindividuals. With respect to the monopoly granted by the Byzantines to a\r\nbanker, it may be observed, that it was only one of the many shifts to\r\nwhich the nakedness of their treasury compelled them to have recourse.\r\nThe list is given in the second book of the Economics, and is not\r\nwithout interest. I would not affirm that their contrivances were\r\ninnocent.[1614] Again, the Selymbrians, in a period of public\r\ndifficulty, constituted themselves monopolists in a manner which Mr.\r\nBœckh might fearlessly have pronounced “less defensible.” By law they\r\nwere not permitted to export in times of scarcity; but being in want of\r\nmoney, they decreed that the state should purchase all the old stock at\r\na fixed price, leaving individuals sufficient for their yearly\r\nconsumption, after which they sold the surplus at a higher price, with\r\npermission to export.[1615]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1610:\r\n\r\n  Id.

Econ. i\r\n  73); whereas this was the case during famines only.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say what men will agree to consider “perfect freedom\r\nof trade;” but it appears to me, that commerce was as unshackled at\r\nAthens as it could have been consistently with the welfare of the\r\ncommunity. Mr. Bœckh says, “There are abundant proofs that exportation\r\nand importation were regulated according to the exigencies and interests\r\nof the community, which is by no means consistent with the perfect\r\nfreedom of trade.”[1616] There appears to lurk a fallacy in this. Such\r\nfreedom as this writer would call perfect is inconsistent with the very\r\nexistence of civil society, whose fundamental laws require that no man’s\r\nfreedom shall trench upon the freedom, and still less upon the life, of\r\nanother. But if in commerce the exigencies and interests of the\r\ncommunity could have been set at nought, there would have been an end of\r\nsuch community, since frequently its well-being, if not its being,\r\ndepended on its commercial relations with foreign states.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1616:\r\n\r\n  Pub. Econ. i. 73, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, it must, doubtless, be admitted, that commerce was\r\nnot free. To this extent, and no further, does Aristotle counsel or\r\ncontemplate interferences with trade: “With regard to importation and\r\nexportation,” he says, “it is necessary to know how large a supply of\r\nprovisions the state requires, and what proportion of them can be\r\nproduced in the country and what imported, and what imports and exports\r\nare necessary for the state, in order that commercial treaties and\r\nagreements may be concluded with those of whom the state must make use\r\nfor this purpose.”[1617]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1617:\r\n\r\n  Rhet. i. 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWith regard to the prohibition to export attributed to Solon, it is\r\nnecessary either to abandon the subject altogether, or to understand it\r\nin the contrary sense to that usually given. Plutarch, as his text now\r\nstands, tells a very strange story, observing, that the exportation of\r\nevery thing but oil was prohibited by Solon, and therefore he adds, it\r\nis not wholly improbable that figs also were prohibited.[1618] I\r\nunderstand the matter differently. Solon, probably observing that\r\nAttica, at that time, produced barely sufficient oil for its own\r\nconsumption, prohibited its exportation, though as agriculture improved,\r\nthe law fell into desuetude, and oil became a principal export. From\r\nthis example, Plutarch thinks it not improbable, that figs also may at\r\nsome time or another have been prohibited. The matter is thus clear and\r\nnatural. Besides, the Scholiast on Pindar, alluding no doubt to some\r\nparticular period, observes, that the exportation of oil was not\r\npermitted.[1619] It is therefore surprising that Bœckh should have\r\nlaid any stress at all on so contradictory a passage, without\r\nendeavouring to restore it, particularly as Solon was himself a merchant\r\nand a transgressor of his supposed law. That the exportation of corn\r\nshould not have been allowed is both intelligible and reasonable, as\r\nAttica never produced sufficient for its own consumption; and they were\r\nnot disposed to adopt the system of the modern Tuscans, who would sell\r\ntheir own corn to the English, and subsist on an inferior sort from the\r\nBlack Sea, if indeed it be inferior.[1620]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1618:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Ulpian, to whom Bœckh, i.\r\n  74, refers, merely repeats the well-known prohibition to ship-captains\r\n  to take a cargo of corn to any foreign port. Orat. x. p. 271. a.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCertain commodities were, however, undoubtedly not allowed to be\r\nexported, as for example, timber, tar, wax, rigging, and “leathern\r\nbottles, articles which,” as Bœckh observes, “were particularly\r\nimportant for the building and equipment of the fleet.”[1621] But the\r\nword which this distinguished scholar conceives to mean “leathern\r\nbottles,” had a very different signification, and meant that leathern\r\ndefence through which the oars passed, and which was designed to keep\r\nthe sea from rushing in at the row-port. This we gather as well from the\r\nscholiast on Aristophanes,[1622] as from several passages of Pollux\r\noverlooked by Bœckh. This writer observes, that the leathern defence\r\nof the row-port was called ἄσκωμα,[1623] and elsewhere he says that a\r\nwoman’s breast, when full of milk, was also so called;[1624] from which\r\nwe may conjecture what form the askoma assumed, when the oar forced it\r\noutwards during the act of rowing. Nor do I suppose that such\r\nprohibition existed only during time of war, for it would have been\r\nequally imprudent to furnish such articles to men preparing for war, as\r\nmen always are in peace, as to such as were actually engaged in it. From\r\na passage in Theophrastus, it has been inferred that permission to\r\nexport timber for ship-building was sometimes granted free of duty to\r\nindividuals; but as it is the Boaster who makes the assertion, adding\r\nthat, to avoid envy, he never made use of it,[1625] it may be regarded\r\nas no less a joke than the reason for prohibiting lamp-wicks from\r\nBœotia, viz., that they might set the fleet on fire![1626]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1621:\r\n\r\n  Economy of Athens, p. 75.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1622:\r\n\r\n  Ran. 364: ἄσκωμα δὲ δερμάτιον τι ᾧ ἐν ταῖς τριήρεσι χρῶνται, καθ᾽ ὁ ἡ\r\n  κώπη βάλλεται.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1623:\r\n\r\n  Pollux. i. 88: τὸ δὲ πρὸς αὐτῷ τῷ σκαλμῷ δέρμα ἄσκωμα.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1624:\r\n\r\n  Pollux. ii. 164: τὸ δε ὑποπιμπλάμενον τοῦ γάλακτος, κὸλπος καὶ ἄσκωμα.\r\n  Cf.

In time of peace, however, the trade in arms was as free\r\nas any other trade; and the Athenians imported from their neighbours,\r\nthe Bœotians, helmets,[1628] in the manufacture of which this people\r\nexcelled. No doubt, as states derive the sinews of war, in part at\r\nleast, from commerce, the Athenians had the sagacity to attack their\r\nenemies in the vulnerable point of their pride, for the purpose of\r\nbringing them the sooner to reason. They thus, too, taught the inferior\r\nstates, such as Megara and Bœotia, that Athens was independent of\r\nthem in all respects, while it was for them to consider whether they\r\nwere equally independent of her.[1629] Thus the Ocean Queen of antiquity\r\nwas said to exercise (as Great Britain formerly) a despotic sway over\r\ntrade; as when, for example, she exacted a tenth from all ships sailing\r\nto or from the Black Sea;[1630] though in this, as in all human affairs,\r\nthe despotism[1631] arose naturally from the possession of superior\r\npower, and could scarcely have been guarded against. To weaken the enemy\r\nby every possible means was the object of a wise policy; so that in\r\ncontemplating every coast belonging to a power not in alliance with\r\nAthens as in a state of blockade,[1632]—in seizing, capturing, or\r\ndetaining, all vessels of every description by which her interests could\r\nbe infringed, Athens only acted in self-defence. That she was hated for\r\nher superiority we need not be surprised, who know with what\r\nheart-burnings and secret aversion our own maritime supremacy has ever\r\nbeen beheld by the nations of the Continent, who repeat against us all\r\nthe accusations anciently muttered by the surrounding states against\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1627:\r\n\r\n  Dem. de Fals.

But allowing them\r\nto have been reprehensible, it remains to be seen whether, in the same\r\ncircumstances, we could have carried any better into execution; for the\r\nability to imagine better is nothing, unless we suppose that events\r\nalways allow men to act up to their knowledge. However this may be, the\r\nAthenian government found itself compelled by its position sometimes to\r\ninterfere with the course of trade; but it may well be doubted whether\r\nany other freedom of trade than there existed be either possible or\r\ndesirable. For, both commerce, and every other mode in which the\r\nenergies of a nation can develope themselves, should no otherwise exist\r\nthan as they are beneficial to the nation at large; and of this the\r\nmanagers of public business ought always to be better judges than\r\nmerchants or speculators, who only consider their own interests, which\r\nmay not always be identical with those of the state. I am far, however,\r\nfrom designing to maintain that the commercial regulations of Athens\r\nwere in no case oppressive. Perhaps in the matter of the corn-trade they\r\nwere so; and yet much may be said for a populous city surrounded by a\r\nbarren country, and therefore solicitous about its own subsistence. Let\r\nus examine those regulations. According to the letter of the law, which\r\nwas often transgressed, no inhabitant of Athens could land a cargo of\r\ncorn anywhere but on the Peiræeus; but, arrived there, and the\r\nnecessities of the state provided for, the remainder could be disposed\r\nof elsewhere. This was the full amount of the grievance, if it ought to\r\nbe so called.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the law which is supposed to have restrained capitalists\r\nfrom lending money on any vessel not returning to Athens with corn or\r\nother commodities, it would be highly unreasonable, with Mr. Bœckh, to\r\ndenominate it “excessively oppressive,” until we understand it.[1633]\r\nFor my own part, until something better be proposed, I must adopt the\r\ninterpretation of Salmasius, that it was not permitted to lend money for\r\nthe purpose of buying corn in other countries except upon the condition,\r\nthat that corn should be imported into Athens.[1634] There no doubt are\r\ndifficulties attending this view of the matter; but this is equally the\r\ncase in whichever way we understand it. It may have been that, in order\r\nto render Athens as far as possible the emporium of the world, the law\r\nrequired that money should not be lent to merchants or supercargoes,\r\nunless it was their intention to return thither with a lading, whether\r\nof corn or some other commodity. But even this seems very doubtful.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1633:\r\n\r\n  Pub. Econ. of Athens, i. 77. i. 65.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1634:\r\n\r\n  De Modo Usur. ap. Vet. p. 193, sqq. Bœckh, i. 78.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut, by whatever laws this branch of trade was regulated, no doubt can\r\nexist as to its extent and importance. For, as the population of Attica\r\nhad, at a very early period, outgrown the means of subsistence supplied\r\nby the country itself, the republic found itself constrained to depend\r\nfor the primary article of food upon the productions of foreign states,\r\nto the amount of nearly one-third of its whole consumption; that is to\r\nsay, while there were grown at home two hundred and ninety-two thousand\r\nthree hundred and ninety-two quarters, as may be proved by\r\ncalculation,[1635] there were imported a hundred and eighteen thousand\r\nquarters in the age of Demosthenes. Earlier its importation of corn was\r\nstill more considerable, when the greater part of the supply was\r\nobtained from Eubœa, by the way of Oropos and the pass of\r\nDeceleia.[1636]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1635:\r\n\r\n  Adv.

And yet the laurel was found to brave the\r\n  inclemencies of the season on Mount Olympos. Most fruit-trees,\r\n  however, as apples, pears, figs, and pomegranates flourished in the\r\n  Crimea abundantly, though the pomegranate required to be covered in\r\n  winter, and all fruits ripened later. The usual timber trees of the\r\n  country were the oak, the elm, and the ash; the pine, the silver-fir,\r\n  and the pitch-tree, finding the climate uncongenial. Theoph. Hist.\r\n  Plant. iv. 5. 3.

For so long as this state attended to her own navy\r\nand maintained her maritime supremacy, there was never, I believe, a\r\ndeficiency of the grain in Peiræeus,[1639] though attempts were\r\nfrequently made by the corn-dealers to create a monopoly and extort\r\nfamine prices from the public,[1640] for which they were sometimes\r\npunished with death. Numerous proofs of the ease with which Athens could\r\nprovision herself, occurred during the latter years of the Peloponnesian\r\nwar, and the age immediately succeeding. Thus, when the Spartans, with\r\ntheir king Agis, were in possession of the pass of Deceleia, and ravaged\r\nhabitually the whole territory of Attica, they felt that even the\r\noccupation of that important post was scarcely of any avail to them so\r\nlong as Athens remained mistress of the sea, since they daily saw\r\nnumbers of corn ships from all parts of the Levant, sailing into the\r\nPeiræeus.[1641] Afterwards, when the Spartans had begun to apply\r\nthemselves to naval affairs, one of their first endeavours was to\r\ndistress Attica, by attacking her corn ships, as on the occasion when\r\nPollis sought to capture the transports in the neighbourhood of\r\nGeræstos, which however were relieved by the fleet under Chabrias.[1642]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1639:\r\n\r\n  Though afterwards in the decline of the republic it was otherwise. See\r\n  in Plutarch an account of the base infraction of the law of nations by\r\n  Demetrius which caused a famine in Athens. Demet. § 33. Cf.

On the contrary, the petty\r\nkings of the countries on the Euxine were so anxious to secure to\r\nthemselves the custom of Athens, that they conferred on that state\r\nnumerous privileges and made her great presents, in order to tempt her\r\ncorn ships into their harbours and prevent the application to rival\r\nstates. It may indeed be said, that peace was scarcely ever interrupted\r\nbetween Athens and the exporting countries, and that not through the\r\nAthenians truckling to them to obtain their corn, but through their\r\ntruckling to the Athenians to be allowed to supply them. Thus, as far as\r\nthe experience of antiquity can be relied on, it must be concluded, that\r\nthe country which purchases agricultural produce invariably exercises a\r\nparamount influence over the countries which supply it. It is in fact a\r\nrule all the world over, that it is the customer who coerces the dealer,\r\nnot the dealer who influences the customer.\r\n\r\nBut, further, this immense importation of grain did not throw any of the\r\nlands of Attica, however poor and barren, out of cultivation.[1643] On\r\nthe contrary, the powers of the soil were still taxed to the utmost, and\r\nthe processes of agriculture carried to a much higher degree of\r\nperfection than in any other part of Greece.[1644] In fact, with its\r\nvineyards, the whole of Attica resembled a continued garden up to the\r\nvery walls of the city.[1645] From which, as well as from positive\r\ntestimony, it appears evident, that the Athenians always retained their\r\npartiality for rural labours,[1646] notwithstanding the extent to which\r\nthe manufacturing system was carried among them. The cultivation of the\r\nsoil has, indeed, so many charms for mankind, that they will never\r\ndesert it so long as it is able to provide for their wants. Men become\r\nmanufacturers only when they can no longer live by agriculture.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1643:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. de Vectigal. ch. i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1644:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph.

Acharn. 32, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt should, perhaps, he added, that of the grain imported into the\r\nPeiræeus the surplus was frequently exported to other parts of Greece,\r\nwhen the wants of the commonwealth had been properly supplied, and that\r\na slight fixed duty, for the sake of revenue, appears to have been\r\nalways levied on imported grain.[1647]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1647:\r\n\r\n  Dem. cont. Neær. § 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut this necessary of life was not generally paid for in specie. On the\r\ncontrary, it was with manufactures that Greece purchased the corn of the\r\nrude nations on the Euxine, whom, by her trade, she gradually reclaimed\r\nfrom barbarism, inoculated with a taste for harmless luxuries, and, at\r\nlength, even for Hellenic literature.[1648]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1648:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. Anab. vii. 5. 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn one case we find that the Nomadic Scythians applied themselves to the\r\ncultivation of the soil, and, of course, became stationary merely for\r\nthe purpose of supplying Greece with corn.[1649] Again, in the later\r\nages of the Roman republic, when a corn-field was a rarity in Italy,\r\nwhich had been almost entirely converted by the nobility into gardens\r\nand pleasure-grounds,[1650] Sicily, Egypt, and other agricultural\r\ncountries of the Levant, furnished so ample a supply of grain, that\r\nscarcity was never experienced, except when the public officers were\r\ngrossly negligent of their duty. In fact, the carrying trade devolved\r\nupon the Phœnicians, who, to a great extent subsisting by it alone, were\r\nnecessarily most careful, for their own sake, to keep up the\r\nsupply.[1651] Had the Romans been themselves a commercial people, like\r\nthe English, their traffic might have been still better regulated.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1649:\r\n\r\n  Herod. iv. 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1650:\r\n\r\n  Varro de Re Rust. l. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1651:\r\n\r\n  Lucian. Navig. § 6.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo return, however: it is admitted, that liberal as, upon the whole, the\r\nprinciples of trade were in antiquity, those of the Athenians were the\r\nmost so of any.[1652] The Argives and Æginetans, at one period,\r\nprohibited the importation of Athenian manufactures, particularly their\r\npottery, or, at least, prohibited the use of them in religious\r\nceremonies, though up to that period they had been allowed. The object,\r\nof course, was to bring their own earthenware into use, Argos,[1653]\r\nespecially, possessing a manufacture which at length rivalled that of\r\nAttica itself. It is regarded as a mark of ancient simplicity, that\r\nneither gold nor silver, nor jewelled plate, but fictile vases merely,\r\nwere originally employed in making libations to the gods.[1654]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1652:\r\n\r\n  Bœckh. i. 80.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1653:\r\n\r\n  Herod. v. 88. Athen. iv. 13. xi. 60.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1654:\r\n\r\n  Valcken. ad Herod. Wessel. p. 416.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same principles which regulated maritime commerce governed also the\r\nintercourse which nations carried on by land. It would, therefore, be\r\nunreasonable to look for what is, oddly enough, denominated\r\n“unrestricted freedom,” since, without at all admitting that “the police\r\nmixed itself with everything,” we cannot deny that the state, in this,\r\nas in all other respects, sought to advance its own interests. Foolish\r\nattempts were sometimes made to bring down the price of certain\r\nnecessaries, as salt, an example of which is mentioned by Aristophanes;\r\nbut the law was soon abrogated.[1655] Had the state been disposed to\r\ninterfere tyrannically in anything, it would have been where corn was\r\nconcerned. It is, however, admitted by Bœckh, who has taken the wrong\r\nside on this question, that in this article “we certainly find a great\r\nfreedom of prices,” though the law interfered to prevent the evil\r\nconsequences to the public of combinations among corn-dealers for the\r\npurpose of creating a monopoly.[1656]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1655:\r\n\r\n  Concion. 813, with the Scholiast.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1656:\r\n\r\n  Econ. of Athens, i. 81.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn general, the business of retail-dealing in the market was confined by\r\nlaw to the citizens, but this was not always rigidly enforced, since we\r\nfind Egyptians, Phœnicians, and other foreigners, had their stalls\r\nthere, for which, it would appear, they paid a distinct duty.[1657] They\r\nwere more especially found among the fishmongers and dealers in small\r\nwares. But, in the Peiræeus, the number of foreign traders greatly\r\nexceeded that of the natives. For their use, moreover, a species of\r\nexchange (δεῖγμα) was created, whither they brought specimens of their\r\nmerchandise for exhibition, the place being usually crowded with buyers\r\nfrom all the neighbouring countries. This was, possibly, the most\r\nstriking scene in Greece, crowded with merchants from the East, in their\r\ngorgeous and varied costumes, intermingled with Greeks of all classes,\r\nand gay women who came hither to see and be seen.[1658]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1657:\r\n\r\n  It is thus that Bœckh understands a passage in the speech against\r\n  Eubulides, § 10, which both Wolf and Taylor interpret very\r\n  differently. With respect to the fact, however, of foreign dealers\r\n  actually holding stalls, we are not left to depend on any doubtful\r\n  testimony.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1658:\r\n\r\n  Pollux, ix. 34. Comm. t. ii. p. 911, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn the prices of things in antiquity, compared with those at present\r\nprevailing, we have only one way of judging, and that is by ascertaining\r\nwhether a greater degree of labour was required to provide the\r\nnecessaries of life. The contrary was certainly the case in Attica,\r\nwhich, nevertheless, was, probably, the most expensive place of\r\nresidence in the world. Even the slaves would appear to have enjoyed\r\nmore leisure and exemption from toil than the industrious classes of our\r\nown most industrious community: and the citizens themselves, with their\r\nnumerous festivals and amusements, public and private, evidently devoted\r\na far greater proportion of their time to pleasure than would now be\r\npossible to any save the opulent. This, in fact, resulted from the\r\nmoderate custom duties charged by the state, but much more from the\r\nsuperior fertility of the soil, which yielded greater returns for less\r\nlabour, and from the comparative fewness of unproductive inhabitants. In\r\nmodern language, the supply was greater in proportion to the demand.\r\nStill, it appears quite certain, that, though the duties laid on by the\r\nstate were moderate, the merchants and retail dealers made very great\r\nprofits. “This,” as Bœckh observes, “is sufficiently proved by the high\r\nrate of interest on money lent upon bottomry, in which thirty per cent\r\nfor one summer was not unfrequently paid.”[1659]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1659:\r\n\r\n  Pub. Econ. of Ath. i. 81, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure that, as a general rule, “a high rate of interest\r\nand profit is an infallible sign that industry and trade are yet in\r\ntheir infancy,” and still less that lowness of interest is a sign of a\r\nflourishing country.[1660] On the contrary, I should infer, from the\r\nformer, that trade was in that healthy state in which it is scarcely a\r\nspeculation; and, from the latter, that its current had become stagnant.\r\nHowever, a high interest was paid, and great profits were made in\r\nantiquity. Of this a striking example is furnished by Herodotus. A\r\nSamian ship trading with Egypt was, by some accident, led to push its\r\nway westward, as far as Tartessos, in Iberia, antecedent to the period\r\nat which the Greeks began to trade regularly with that port.[1661] What\r\nthe nature and value of its cargo may have been is not known, any more\r\nthan the articles which it received in exchange. The conjecture,\r\nhowever, that it received silver at a low rate, as the Phœnicians\r\nanciently did, is not improbable. At all events, the merchants engaged\r\nin this adventure cleared upon that one cargo the sum of sixty talents,\r\nof which, in pious gratitude, they dedicated a tenth to Hera the tutelar\r\ngoddess of their island. And this historian adds, that, with the\r\nexception of Sostratos of Ægina, the most fortunate of mercantile\r\nadventurers, no Grecian merchant had ever up to his time made so\r\nsuccessful a voyage.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1660:\r\n\r\n  Compare Hume’s Essay on Interest, p. 172, sqq. with Mr. Bœckh’s Public\r\n  Economy of Athens, i. 82.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1661:\r\n\r\n  Herod. iv. 152.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                              NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the art of navigation was not invented by the Greeks, it will be in\r\nthis place unnecessary to inquire very minutely into its rude\r\nbeginnings. Most maritime tribes doubtless discovered for themselves the\r\nmeans of traversing such rivers, and creeks, and bays, and arms of the\r\nsea, as lay in their immediate neighbourhood and impeded their\r\ncommunication, whether hostile or friendly, with the various tribes on\r\ntheir borders. Another motive, moreover, which probably tempted men to\r\ntrust themselves very early upon the waters, was the desire to regale on\r\nthose dainty fish which abound on nearly all shores, and constitute\r\namong the most savage nations an important article of food. It will\r\nreadily be believed that history cannot pretend to name the individual\r\nwho in any country first launched his raft or canoe upon the deep.\r\nNevertheless, tradition among the Phœnicians, endeavoured to supply the\r\ndefect of history. Ousoös, we are told,[1662] a primitive Arab hero,\r\nobserving the trunk of a large tree overthrown, perhaps by a hurricane,\r\nnear the shore, lopped off the branches, set it afloat, and committed\r\nhimself along with it to the mercy of the waves. He had very soon an\r\nabundance of imitators. In every part of the Red Sea, on the Nile, the\r\nIndus, and the Persian Gulf, hardy navigators made their appearance, who\r\nundertook voyages more or less hazardous, in piraguas constructed of a\r\nsingle bamboo, or the shell of a vast tortoise, or of a wicker-work\r\nframe covered with leather[1663]—the coracles of our British ancestors\r\nstill in common use on many streams in Wales. Occasionally, too, more\r\nespecially on the rivers and shores of the Euxine, capacious, long, and\r\nsturdy barks[1664] were scooped out of the trunks of enormous trees,\r\nwhich were denominated Monoxyla, and seem to have been at one time or\r\nanother in general use all over the world from the island of Australasia\r\nto the Arctic Circle. A specimen of those employed by our own\r\nforefathers may be seen in the colonnade of our national Museum. On the\r\nNile were several kinds of barks peculiar to Egypt, such for example, as\r\nthose which were plaited from the papyrus plant,[1665] or from rushes.\r\nMost extraordinary of all, however, were their boats of earthenware, in\r\nwhich, furnished both with sails and oars, they glided over the serene\r\nbosom of the river.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1662:\r\n\r\n  Sanchoniath. ap Euseb.

Among the greatest difficulties they had to encounter\r\nwas the scarcity of ship-timber, for which they were always compelled\r\ngreatly to depend on other countries. The materials, however, being\r\ncollected, their shipwrights appear to have proceeded in much the same\r\nmanner as those of modern times, laying down the keel, fixing in the\r\nribs, planking, decking, caulking, and pitching, until the hull was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1666:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Hom. Il. α. 316. Thucyd. i. 10.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn their war-galleys,[1667] constructed under the superintendence of a\r\nnaval architect elected by lot, they exhausted all the resources of art\r\nin their endeavours to communicate to them the greatest beauty of form\r\nand splendour of appearance. Painting, carving, and gilding,[1668] were\r\ncalled in to cover both stern and prow with images and ornaments of the\r\nmost fanciful kinds, glowing with bright blue or vermilion,[1669]\r\nintermingled with scrolls and flourishes of other colours, and figures\r\nof burnished gold. Occasionally beneath the rim of the prow were bright\r\ncerulean bands,[1670] painted in encaustic and defended by so durable a\r\nvarnish that they could neither be blistered by the sun, nor dimmed by\r\nthe action of the sea-water. In this part, beneath the roots as it were\r\nof the acrostolion, were placed those ornaments resembling eyes, one on\r\neither side, over which the name of the ship was written.[1671] The\r\nsweep of the deck was a gentle curve, the lowest dip of which was at the\r\nship’s waist. On the poop stood a deep alcove in which the pilot took\r\nhis station,[1672] protected in a great degree from wind and weather,\r\nand having over his head a large lantern, in which a bright light was\r\nkindled at nightfall.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1667:\r\n\r\n  Vid.

Hesych. in v.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFirm and lofty bulwarks rose along the ship’s sides, protecting the\r\nmariners from being swept off in tempests by the passing surge. On the\r\nbows again, there was usually a square tower furnished with lofty\r\nportals, through which the combatants, protected from annoyances on both\r\nflanks, poured, in close fight, their darts into the enemy’s ship, or\r\nrushed forward to board it. At the very front of the prow, where our\r\nbowsprit is now placed, arose an elegant winding scroll, which though\r\nprojecting slightly beyond the hull, could never touch the corresponding\r\npart of the enemy’s galley until the iron or brazen beaks[1673] below\r\nhad met and shattered each other. The rudder[1674] consisted of two\r\npaddles placed one on either side of the ship, which was impelled along\r\nby oar and sail. The row-ports of these galleys being somewhat capacious\r\nmight, if left open, have shipped a great deal of water, on which\r\naccount they were furnished with strong leather bags, in form like a\r\nwoman’s breast, projecting outwards, nailed to the circle of the\r\nrow-port, and fitting tight about the oar. The rowers, to render their\r\ncondition more comfortable, were furnished with cushions or soft-dressed\r\nfleeces.[1675]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1673:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Eq. 552.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1674:\r\n\r\n  Spallanzani in describing the preparations made by the Portuguese for\r\n  the first doubling of the Cape of Good Hope, mentions, among other\r\n  things, a double rudder, so “that in case one should be damaged there\r\n  might be another to act.” Travels in the Two Sicilies, iv. 201.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1675:\r\n\r\n  The sea-term ὑπηρέσιον which occurs in Thucydides, ii. 93, is very\r\n  variously explained. Mitford (Hist. Greece, iii. 154) contends, that\r\n  it means a sort of bag placed in the τρῆμα, or aperture through which\r\n  the oar passed, and was designed to prevent the flowing in of the\r\n  waves. This bag, however, as I have already remarked in pp. 289, 290,\r\n  was called ἄσκωμα. Poll. ii. 154. Potter (ii. 136,) thinks it was a\r\n  skin on which the rowers sat. Lilius Gyraldus, (De Navigiis, c. vi. p.\r\n  627,) supposes it to have been that part of the galley on which the\r\n  oar rested, and sometimes signified the oar itself. The Greek\r\n  scholiast on Thucydides, (t. v. p. 399,) agrees with Potter, saying,\r\n  that it means a sheep-skin with the fleece which covered the rowers’\r\n  benches.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe merchantmen differed considerably both in form and general\r\narrangements from the war-galleys. As in our own ships of burden, under\r\nthe old system of admeasurement, the hull instead of sinking down sharp\r\ntowards the keel, bellied outwards at the sides, so as to render the\r\nbottom almost flat. They were very much shorter, moreover, in proportion\r\nto their height than ships of the line,[1676] which, from their slender\r\nelongated figure, obtained the appellation of long galleys. In trading\r\nvessels,[1677] much greater stress was laid on sails than on oars, since\r\nthe crews could never be sufficiently numerous to furnish constantly\r\nfresh relays of rowers; and, in their protracted voyages, it would have\r\nbeen impossible for the same men to remain perpetually on the benches.\r\nThe masts consequently were here of very great height, equalling,\r\naccording to rule, the length of the ship, which rendered it practicable\r\nto crowd an immense quantity of canvass, but at the same time rendered\r\nthem liable to capsize in a heavy gale, as is still the case with the\r\nLevant-built ships, which are generally much taller rigged than ours.\r\nThey commonly gave a greater length to the hull of transports, though\r\nnot altogether so great as to ships of war. Pirate luggers were always\r\nbuilt without decks,[1678] and extremely low that they might be the\r\nbetter able to approach their prey unperceived. Their sloops, smacks,\r\nand lighters,[1679] together with all the other small craft employed in\r\nthe coasting trade, exhibited every variety of form, but appear to have\r\nbeen generally stout-built and well-appointed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1676:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Schol. Aristoph. Eq. 1363.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1677:\r\n\r\n  One of these vessels, when built for speed, would, with a fair wind,\r\n  make a hundred and fifty miles in the twenty-four hours.

Schol. t. v. p. 311.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1679:\r\n\r\n  Much of the coasting trade of the Mediterranean is still carried on in\r\n  extremely small barks or open boats. See Spallanzani, Travels in the\r\n  Two Sicilies, iii. 122, sqq. In the Adriatic, however, the necessity\r\n  has at length been felt of employing vessels of a broad and flat\r\n  construction, and extremely solid, to resist the violence of the\r\n  storms so frequent in that sea, id. iv. 200.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRespecting the tonnage and dimensions of the largest class of\r\nmerchantmen, we possess little positive information. It would appear,\r\nhowever, that in comparison with the vessels engaged in the corn-trade,\r\nbetween Alexandria and Italy,[1680] they were of very moderate burden,\r\nsince the appearance of one of those large ships in the Peiræeus excited\r\ngeneral astonishment. The size of this Egyptian trader, which seems to\r\nhave been no way distinguished from others engaged in the same traffic,\r\nmay perhaps assist the imagination in forming some definite idea of an\r\nancient merchantman: its length, from stem to stern, was one hundred and\r\neighty feet, its breadth nearly fifty, and its clear depth in the hold\r\nabout forty-five. It was furnished with one enormous mast, with yards in\r\nproportion, and a capacious mainsail, composed of numerous tiers of\r\nox-hides. The cables and anchors, capstains, windlasses, with all the\r\nother appurtenances of a ship, were on a suitable scale, while the crew\r\nwas so numerous as to be compared to an army. In the stem were airy and\r\nspacious cabins, above which rose the gilded figure of a goose. On\r\neither side of the bows stood an image of Isis,[1681] bending over the\r\nwaves and appearing to afford her divine protection to those who had\r\nchosen her for their tutelar goddess. Among the Greeks, however, the\r\nplace assigned to the tutelar divinity was sometimes the stern, where\r\noaths were taken, expiations made, prayers and sacrifices offered up,\r\nand where such of the crew as had committed any offence took sanctuary.\r\nOn the top of the mast was a vane[1682] of burnished metal which,\r\nturning and flashing in the sun, appeared like a streak of flame. As\r\ntheir ships, more especially during long voyages, ran perpetual risk of\r\nbeing assailed by pirates, they were abundantly supplied with all kinds\r\nof arms and implements of war, which were ranged along the cabin\r\npartitions and elsewhere with so much order and regularity, that they\r\ncould always, by night or day, be found at a moment’s warning.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1680:\r\n\r\n  Lucian.

As\r\n  many of our sailors carry about their persons a child’s caul as an\r\n  amulet to protect them against the dangers of the ocean, so the\r\n  mariners of Greece attributed a sort of miraculous power to the skins\r\n  of the seal and the hyæna, which they bound around the summits of\r\n  their masts as a safeguard against lightning and thunderbolts. Plut.\r\n  Sympos, iv. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt was by very slow advances that the ancients arrived at that high\r\ndegree of excellence in the art of ship-building, which, in the most\r\nflourishing ages of Greece, its maritime states exhibited. In the\r\nHomeric age, the largest vessels known were of very moderate burden,\r\nsince even the poet, who would doubtless allow himself some licence,\r\nspeaks of no transport which could carry more than one hundred and fifty\r\nmen. These barks, too, Thucydides thinks, were undecked, like the pirate\r\nvessels of his own times, and indeed in ours also, in most parts of the\r\nÆgæan, though I have myself sailed in a large Greek brig, of piratical\r\nconstruction, which carried several guns, and was not only decked, but\r\nso admirably built, that after labouring ten days in a storm, she made\r\nnot an inch more water than when in port.\r\n\r\nThe various stages in improvement have not been marked. They went on,\r\nhowever, each age excelling that which had preceded it, until at length\r\nhaving reached the utmost perfection of which their system was\r\nsusceptible, they began to apply their skill to the creation of huge\r\nfabrics merely for show and magnificence, and calculated rather for the\r\ngratification of an insane luxury than for the genuine purposes of\r\ntrade. One of these naval monsters was constructed at Syracuse under the\r\neye of Archimedes, and at the expense of king Hiero.\r\n\r\nHaving procured from the forests of Mount Ætna timber sufficient for the\r\nbuilding of sixty triremes, together with a variety of other materials\r\nfrom Italy, Spain, and Gaul, as crooked timber for ribs, hard wood for\r\npegs, with pitch and hemp, and Spanish broom[1683] for cables, he\r\nassembled a sufficient number of ship-wrights, with Archias, the\r\nCorinthian, at their head, and set them to work under the inspection of\r\nArchimedes, though he himself spent the greater part of his day\r\noverlooking the workmen at the dock. When in about six months the\r\nplanking had been carried to about half the height of the hull, and\r\nproperly sheathed with lead in lieu of the copper at present employed,\r\nthe ship was launched[1684] by means of a machine, invented for the\r\npurpose by Archimedes, into a sort of floating dock, where it was\r\ncompleted in other six months. The planks were fastened to the ribs with\r\ncopper bolts, of which some were of ten and others fifteen pounds’\r\nweight, passed through holes prepared for them by the auger; and over\r\nthe heads of these bolts plates of lead were fixed, having been first\r\nlined, as it were, with a layer of wadding steeped in pitch.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1683:\r\n\r\n  Athen. v. 40.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1684:\r\n\r\n  By what ceremonies a ship-launch was accompanied in antiquity, I have\r\n  nowhere discovered. Those which take place on the occasion in modern\r\n  Greece are extremely pleasing, and may, perhaps, have had a classical\r\n  origin. A crown of flowers “is suspended from the prow of a vessel\r\n  when it is first launched, and the ‘καρόβακηρι,’ or master of the\r\n  ship, raises the jar of wine to his lips as he stands upon the deck,\r\n  and then pours it on the ground. Surely, nothing can be more\r\n  beautifully classical; and it were to be wished that we could trace\r\n  some part of a ceremony that takes place with us upon the same\r\n  occasion to this source, and not consider it as an imitation of one of\r\n  the most sacred rites of our religion.” Douglas, p. 65.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThey next proceeded to the interior arrangements, the explanation of\r\nwhich is replete with difficulty. The whole depth of the ship seems to\r\nhave been divided into four stories, of which the lowest, or hold, was\r\nfilled by the cargo; the second, descended to by long flights of steps,\r\nwas appropriated to the rowers, who were ranged in twenty banks; the\r\nthird was laid out in cabins for the use of the crew, while the military\r\nofficers and the men occupied the uppermost. The kitchen was situated in\r\nthe stern.\r\n\r\nAll these cabins were adorned with pavements in mosaic, representing in\r\na long series of compartments the entire action of the Iliad; while the\r\nfurniture, doors, and ceilings were furnished with proportionate\r\nsplendour and elegance. On the upper deck was a gymnasium, exactly\r\nproportioned to the dimensions of the ship, together with a number of\r\nwalks running through the midst of gardens laid out on leaden terraces,\r\nand containing all kinds of odoriferous plants and flowers. All these\r\nalleys were arched with trellis-work, overlaid with the intermingled\r\nfoliage of the white-ivy and the vine growing out of troughs filled with\r\nearth, arranged along the promenades, and watered like other gardens. In\r\na different part of the ship was a magnificent apartment called the\r\nAphrodision, furnished with three couches, and having a pavement\r\nvariegated with agates, and all the richest and most beautiful marbles\r\nof Sicily. It was wainscotted and roofed with cypress, while its doors\r\nwere of Atlantic citron-wood inlaid with ivory. On all sides, moreover,\r\nit was adorned with pictures and statues and vases and goblets, of the\r\nmost fanciful and varied forms. Contiguous to this chamber was the\r\nlibrary, furnished with five couches and store of books. Its doors and\r\nwainscot were of box, and on its roof was a sun-dial, constructed in\r\nimitation of that in the Achradina. There was also a bath, in which were\r\nthree couches, and three caldaria of bronze, together with a basin\r\ncontaining five metretæ, lined with Taurominian marble of various\r\ncolours. There were numerous cabins fitted up for the soldiers and the\r\ncrew, from whom was selected a number of persons whose sole business it\r\nwas to superintend the pumps.[1685] The ship likewise contained twenty\r\nstables, ten on either hand, well supplied with fodder, and every\r\nconvenience for the grooms.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1685:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Schol. Aristoph. Eq. 432.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the bows was a prodigious reservoir of fresh-water, lined with\r\ntarpaulin, and kept under lock and key; and near it lay the piscina or\r\nfish-pond, overlaid with lead, and filled with sea-water, in which was\r\npreserved an ample supply of fish for a long voyage. On projecting\r\ngalleries, extending along the ship’s sides, were situated the\r\nwood-house, the kitchen, the bake-house, the mills, and other\r\nconveniences. At different distances along the sides were ranged\r\nnumerous figures of Atlas, nine feet in height, supporting the triglyphs\r\nand the projecting portions of the ship: its whole surface, moreover,\r\nwas adorned with suitable paintings.\r\n\r\nThere arose from the deck eight towers, two on the stern, two on the\r\nprow, and four in the ship’s waist, in diameter and elevation\r\nproportioned to the dimensions of the whole. From the outer battlements\r\nof each of these turrets projected two immense beams, hollowed out like\r\ntroughs, which being balanced in the middle on the edge of the tower,\r\ncould be filled with huge stones, that, by elevating the inner extremity\r\nof the machine, were launched into the enemy’s ship as it sailed\r\nbeneath. These engines were probably worked by ropes and pulleys\r\nattached to the opposite battlements. Six armed men, two of whom were\r\narchers, took their station in each turret, the whole interior of which\r\nwas filled with stones and darts. All round the ship, supported by a\r\nseries of triangles, ran a gallery, defended by a parapet and\r\nbattlements. On this stood a catapult, invented by Archimedes, which\r\ncast darts eighteen feet long, with stones upwards of three hundred and\r\nfifty pounds in weight, to the distance of a furlong. This gallery, as\r\nwell, I presume, as the men who worked the engine, was protected by a\r\nclose net-work of large ropes suspended from brazen chains. To each of\r\nthe three masts was attached a couple of engines, which darted iron bars\r\nand masses of lead against the enemy. The sides of the ship bristled\r\nwith iron spikes, designed to protect it against boarding; and on all\r\nsides were likewise grapples, which could be flung by machines into the\r\ngalleys of the foe, so as to retain them within reach of the missiles\r\nfrom on board. Along the galleries, and round the masts and catapults,\r\nwere drawn up two hundred and forty men in complete armour. In the fore,\r\nmain, and mizen-tops were stationed other warriors, who were supplied\r\nwith stones and similar missiles by baskets running on pulleys, and\r\nworked by boys. The ship was supplied with twelve anchors, of which four\r\nwere of wood, and eight of iron.[1686]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1686:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Artemid. Oneirocrit. ii. 23, p. 110, with the amusing conjectures\r\n  of Goguet, &c., on the origin of anchors, Origine des Loix, ii. 221.\r\n  Pausanias attributes the invention of the anchor to Midas, i. 4. 5.\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Eq. 753. If we may trust to the testimony of Lucian,\r\n  a small boat-anchor could be bought for five drachmas. Dialog.\r\n  Mortuorum, iv. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nVery little difficulty was experienced in discovering pines sufficiently\r\nlofty for the fore and mizen-masts of this huge galley; but it was only\r\nby accident that a swineherd in the mountains of the Abruzzi found a\r\ntree of sufficient magnitude for the mainmast. It was conveyed to the\r\nsea by Philias, an engineer of Taurominium. The pump, notwithstanding\r\nits great depth, was easily worked by the screw of Archimedes, and only\r\nrequired the labour of one individual. The name first bestowed on this\r\nship by Hiero was “The Syracusan;” but when afterwards he despatched it\r\nas a present to King Ptolemy, he changed it to that of the “The\r\nAlexandrian.”\r\n\r\nBesides the individuals already enumerated, there were six hundred men\r\nstationed on the prow; and to administer justice in this floating\r\ncommonwealth a court was instituted, consisting of the captain, the\r\npilot, and the principal officers in command in the forecastle, who\r\njudged according to the laws of Syracuse. It was followed on the voyage\r\nto Egypt by a number of smaller craft, of which the majority were\r\nfishing-smacks.\r\n\r\nThe cargo of “The Alexandrian,” which, together with the vessel itself,\r\nwas presented to King Ptolemy at a time when famine raged in Egypt,\r\nconsisted of sixty thousand medimni of corn, two thousand jars of\r\nsalt-fish, twenty thousand talents of wool, and an equal quantity of\r\nother commodities. The poet Archimelos having written a copy of verses\r\non this nautical castle, Hiero felt so greatly flattered by the\r\ncompliment that he sent the author a thousand medimni of wheat, which he\r\nlanded for him at the Peiræeus.\r\n\r\nIn order to convey some idea of another department of nautical\r\narchitecture among the ancients, in which there was probably a greater\r\ndisplay of fancy than of science, we shall here introduce the\r\ndescription of a pleasure-barge in which Ptolemy Philopater and the\r\nladies of his court used to sail upon the Nile.[1687] Among the caliphs\r\nand sultans of the East we find traces of a similar taste for gorgeous\r\nand magnificent barks; but neither in history nor fiction do we remember\r\nto have met any account of a vessel so curiously constructed, or so\r\nsuperbly and sumptuously adorned. It was, in the first place, half a\r\nfurlong in length, flat-bottomed, and rising high above the water on\r\naccount of the swell, with projecting keel, and prow of most graceful\r\ncurvature,—or, I should rather, perhaps, say, prows, for it appeared\r\ndouble in front, as though a pair of galleys had been lashed together.\r\nAlong the sides and stern ran two galleries, the one above the other,\r\nwhere the persons on board might stroll and take exercise as the barge\r\nwas wafted along by the wind. Of these the lower one resembled an open\r\nperistyle, the upper a close arcade furnished at intervals with windows\r\nlooking out upon the river.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1687:\r\n\r\n  The great attention paid to navigation by the Egyptians, under the\r\n  government of the Ptolemies, may be inferred from the fact, that they\r\n  possessed at one time upwards of four thousand ships of all sizes.\r\n  Athen. v. 36.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nConsidering the whole barge as one great building, the architect placed\r\nthe extreme hall encircled by a single row of columns at the extremity\r\nof the stern, where it was, doubtless, approached from the upper\r\ngallery. Having traversed this, you next beheld a propylæon erected with\r\nthe most precious wood and ivory. This led into a proscenion roofed\r\nover, in the vicinity of which lay a variety of chambers. Of these the\r\nmost remarkable was a vast peripheral hall fitted up with twenty\r\ncouches. This apartment was wainscotted with cedar and Milesian cypress;\r\nthe doors, twenty in number, were formed of panels of citron wood richly\r\ninlaid with ivory. The hinges, the nails, the knockers, and\r\ndoor-handles, were of copper, gilt. The shafts of the columns were\r\ncypress wood, and the Corinthian capitals of gold and ivory were\r\nsurmounted by an architrave richly overlaid with gold. Above this again\r\nwas a broad frieze adorned with numerous figures of animals roughly\r\nsculptured in ivory, but remarkable for the costliness of the materials.\r\nThe ceiling was of cedar wood elaborately carved and covered with a\r\nblaze of gilding. Close at hand were the apartments of the women, in the\r\nstructure and ornaments of which equal magnificence was displayed. In\r\nanother part of the bark was a chapel of Aphroditè surmounted by a dome.\r\nIt contained a statue of the goddess in Parian marble. This sacred\r\nedifice was surrounded by other suites of apartments among which was a\r\nsymposion adorned with pillars of Indian marble. Towards the prow was a\r\nsaloon sacred to Dionysos, surrounded on all sides with pillars\r\nfurnished with numerous couches, and adorned with gilded cornices. The\r\nroof was enriched with ornaments suited to the character of the god,\r\nthat is, in all probability orgeastic processions of Bacchantes and\r\nBacchanals, with crowns of ivy and vine leaves. On the right hand this\r\nsaloon opened into a grotto or cavern, in which the colours of rocks\r\nwere imitated by an incrustation of precious stones, whose brilliance\r\nwas in various parts relieved by ornaments of gold. The busts of the\r\nroyal family sculptured of Parian marble were ranged round the grot.\r\n\r\nOn the roof of the great saloon was erected a small symposion, in the\r\nform of a tent, exceedingly agreeable from its airiness and the fine\r\nprospect it commanded over the whole valley of the Nile. It was\r\ncompletely open in front, and the roof consisting of a series of\r\nsemicircular hoops like the top of a calèche, it could be bent down and\r\ndrawn forward at pleasure, and was covered with purple hangings. By a\r\nwinding staircase constructed in a different part of the bark, you\r\nascended to another hall, constructed and decorated after the Egyptian\r\nmanner, being adorned with a number of round pillars composed of a\r\nsuccession of blocks of equal height, alternately white and black. Their\r\ncapitals, likewise were round, but contracting rather than expanding at\r\nthe top like an elongated rose-bud.\r\n\r\nIn all this part of the column, technically denominated calathos, there\r\nwere neither volutes nor rows of open and projecting foliage as in Greek\r\narchitecture, but bells of the river lotos, or other flowers,\r\nintermingled with newly formed fruit of the date palm. To correspond\r\nwith these columns, the walls of Egyptian edifices were frequently lined\r\nwith black and white slabs alternating with each other. Of these the\r\nwhite were sometimes of alabaster.\r\n\r\nThis bark was furnished with but one mast, one hundred and five feet in\r\nheight, to which was fitted a single sail of byssus with purple fringe.\r\nThe dimensions of the sail must, however, have been prodigious, but from\r\nthe fineness of its fabric it could never have been hoisted in rough\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nIf we turn now to the materials wherewith the ships of the ancients were\r\nconstructed we shall find that they here differed as much from the\r\npractice of modern nations, at least in the north, as in the form and\r\nstyle of rigging. With us scarcely anything but oak or teak is employed\r\nin those parts which come in contact with the water, whereas the Greeks\r\nconstructed their war galleys, in which speed was of the greatest\r\nmoment, of fir,[1688] while they chiefly made use of pitch pine in the\r\nbuilding of merchantmen, as that wood long resists the corrosive action\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1688:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. Hist. Plant. v. 6. 5. Plat. de Legg. iv. t. vii. 333.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Cypriotes appear in all cases to have given the preference to the\r\npine which abounds in the island, and was esteemed superior to the pitch\r\ntree,[1689] though the latter was sometimes appropriated to the building\r\nof ships of war. Among the Syrians and Phœnicians, in whose country a\r\nsupply of pine was not to be obtained,[1690] the custom prevailed of\r\nbuilding ships entirely of cedar.[1691] The practice of employing\r\noak[1692] had, likewise, already been introduced, though it does not\r\nappear to have been common; but in the larger classes of ships the keel\r\nwas always of that timber, in order that, when drawn on shore, it might\r\nbe able to sustain the weight of the superincumbent mass. In the\r\nholcades or merchantmen, the keel, like the ship itself, was of pitch\r\npine; but all such vessels were in those days supplied with a false\r\nkeel, called chelysma,[1693] of oak, or oxya, designed to act as a\r\nprotection when they were drawn up into dry dock. Masts and yards were\r\ncommonly of the silver fir;[1694] oars of such timber as grew on the\r\nnorthern slopes of mountains.[1695] The turned work used in ornamenting\r\nthe interior was commonly of mulberry, ash, elm, or platane wood, of\r\nwhich the last was least esteemed.[1696]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1689:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

There were cedars on Mount Lebanon eighteen\r\n  feet in circumference, v. 8. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1692:\r\n\r\n  Theophrastus appears to give the preference to the oak of Epeiros, the\r\n  acorns of which had been frequently sown in other parts of Greece, but\r\n  produced, he says, inferior timber.

It has\r\nbeen seen above, in speaking of the Egyptian war ships, that they\r\nsometimes consisted of a number of hides sown together. They were,\r\nlikewise, in various countries, plaited, as now in China,[1697] from\r\nreeds, or rushes, but the sailcloth of the Greeks was generally, like\r\nour own, woven from hemp.[1698] For this, in Egypt, the papyrus was\r\nsometimes substituted. Princes and grandees occasionally, in their\r\npleasure-boats, employed, in lieu of these rude materials, cotton or\r\nfine linen, dyed, to augment their beauty, of the most brilliant purple.\r\nTo this Shakespeare alludes in the following passage, which though\r\nfamiliar, perhaps, to the reader, I must, nevertheless, beg permission\r\nto quote:\r\n\r\n        The barge she sat in, like a burnish’d throne,\r\n        Burnt on the water: the poop was beaten gold;\r\n        Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that\r\n        The winds were love-sick with ’em: the oars were silver;\r\n        Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made\r\n        The water which they beat to follow faster,\r\n        As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,\r\n        It beggar’d all description. She did lie\r\n        In her pavilion, (cloth of gold of tissue,)\r\n        O’er-picturing that Venus, where we see\r\n        The fancy out-work nature. On each side her,\r\n        Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling cupids,\r\n        With diverse-colour’d fans, whose wind did seem\r\n        To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool;\r\n        And what they undid, did.——\r\n        Her gentlewomen, like the Nereids, or\r\n        So many mermaids, tended her i’ th’ eyes’,\r\n        And made their bends adorning; at the helm\r\n        A seeming mermaid steers; the silken tackles\r\n        Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,\r\n        That yarely frame the office. From the barge\r\n        A strange invisible perfume hits the sense\r\n        Of the adjacent wharfs.[1699]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1697:\r\n\r\n  Goguet, iv. 260.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1698:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. Hist. iv. 8. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1699:\r\n\r\n  Anthony and Cleopatra, Act ii. Scene 3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAn ancient anonymous writer on the art military describes a vessel\r\nclosely resembling our steamboats in construction, but in which\r\nbullocks, stationed in the hold, worked the paddle-wheels instead of an\r\nengine. It flew along the water, says the author, without oars or sails,\r\nsimply by the impulses of wheels, which, rising partly above the waves,\r\noperated, when in action, like a succession of oars.\r\n\r\nRopes and cables[1700] were manufactured in antiquity from a great\r\nvariety of materials. At first, the cordage most in use would appear to\r\nhave been composed of twisted thongs; for which, in process of time, was\r\nsubstituted goats’ hair,[1701] the Spanish broom,[1702] the bark of the\r\ncornel[1703] and linden-tree,[1704] with byblos, hemp,[1705] and\r\nflax.[1706] The enormous cables which supported the bridge thrown by\r\nXerxes over the Hellespont were manufactured from mixed materials, of\r\nwhich two-thirds were byblos and one-third white flax.[1707] They were\r\nof dimensions so vast that a piece half a yard in length weighed one\r\nhundred and twenty-five pounds.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1700:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

We know, however, that the\r\nmariners as well on board the merchantmen of Athens as those of the\r\nother states of Greece, were partly citizens, partly strangers, and in\r\nmany instances slaves. Leading a life full of hardship and danger,\r\nengaged as it were in a perpetual conflict with the elements, their\r\ntempers grew fierce, their manners boisterous and rude,[1708] and their\r\nmorals none of the most elevated. During the intervals they spent on\r\nshore, they endeavoured by snatching at all the coarse pleasures within\r\ntheir reach, to make themselves some amends for their habitual\r\nprivations. The excuse, however, for this conduct was often\r\nsophistically borrowed from religion, for during the prevalence of\r\nstorms at sea, it was customary to make vows to Poseidon, or Castor and\r\nPolydeukes, or some of the other patrons of the nautical art; and on\r\nreaching port the victims were slain and offered up, and the sacrifice\r\nof necessity was accompanied by a feast. To these their boon companions,\r\ndancing-girls, female flute-players, hetairæ, jugglers, and low\r\nparasites, were invited, and the whole usually terminated in excessive\r\nintoxication and a battle royal. Most mariners were attached to some\r\ndame of equivocal reputation in the Peiræeus or elsewhere, to whom on\r\ntheir return from voyages they were in the habit of bringing presents,\r\nsuch as a pair of gilded slippers, a dainty cheese, a jar of pickles, or\r\nsaltfish, or a measure or two of onions. What was the amount of wages,\r\nwhich enabled them to indulge in this kind of liberality, I have nowhere\r\nbeen able to discover, though in all probability it was at least equal\r\nto the pay received by seamen in the war-galleys, that is from three to\r\nfour oboloi a-day. Their operations while on board, were regulated of\r\ncourse by circumstances and the accidents of the weather. Thus, when the\r\nbreeze was strong and favourable, they might lounge or sit about the\r\ndecks, or sleep, during the greater part of the twenty-four hours,\r\nwithout shifting a sail or handling an oar, though a man was always\r\nstationed at the prow to keep a sharp look-out, and watch the aspect of\r\nthe sky.[1709] In calms, however, or when the swell and roar of the sea\r\nforetold an approaching tempest, the whole crew took to their cushions,\r\nand raising at the command of the boatswain,[1710] a loud chant,[1711]\r\nwhich contended in volume with the angry voice of the ocean, they\r\nstrained every nerve to augment the velocity of their bark, and gain\r\nsome friendly port before the storm fairly set in. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, they were overtaken by tempests in the neighbourhood of rocky\r\nislands or bleak and inhospitable promontories like the Chelidonian\r\nrocks, where from whatever point of the compass the wind might blow a\r\nheavy surge beat upon the shore perpetually. Under these circumstances\r\nit was observed, more especially during the darkness of the night, that\r\ntwo brilliant glancing lights played evermore about the masts and yards,\r\nshooting hither and thither, and kindling up the crest of the surge by\r\ntheir luminous appearance. These were the Dioscuri, the tender and\r\naffectionate brothers of Helen, whose benevolence towards mankind in\r\ngeneral was only to be equalled by their attachment to each other. When\r\nmatters came to extremities and the waves appeared ready to engulf both\r\ncrew and passengers, all on board became keenly sensible to the\r\nirregularities of their past lives, and the whispered interrogation\r\npassed round the bark: “have you been initiated?” Because those to whom\r\nthe truths treasured up in the sanctuary of Eleusis had been revealed,\r\nwere supposed to be better prepared than other men for meeting death,\r\nand appearing at the judgment-seat of heaven. It was now that vows and\r\nprayers were heard, and that feelings of repentance were sincere, and it\r\nwould have required a more than ordinary degree of apathy to forget such\r\ncircumstances when, by an unlooked-for interposition of Providence, they\r\nwere snatched from the jaws of death, and restored to their kindred and\r\ntheir homes. We may remark here, by the way, that, to passengers\r\nlabouring under the effects of sea-sickness, a decoction of a species of\r\nthyme[1712] (thymum tragoriganum) was administered.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1708:\r\n\r\n  Plat.

This was more especially the case\r\nwith the Athenian seamen, who, in the flourishing periods of Hellenic\r\nhistory bore much the same relation to the other seafarers of Greece, as\r\nthe sailors of England do to those of the neighbouring European states.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1713:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Themist. § 19.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlthough the mariners’ compass had not yet been invented, the ancient\r\nsailors did not, as appears to be generally supposed, creep timidly from\r\nheadland to headland along the shore, but traversed boldly the open sea,\r\ndirecting their course by the constellations, more particularly that of\r\nthe greater bear. In this practice the Arabs of Phœnicia led the way as\r\nin most other early improvements connected with seamanship.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes believed that, in very remote ages, mankind possessed no\r\nnames for the winds,[1714] because as they had not yet addicted\r\nthemselves to navigation, it concerned them very little to observe how\r\nor which way they blew. Possibly, however, we somewhat exaggerate the\r\nheedlessness and ignorance of the remoter generations of men who must\r\nhave been singularly obtuse in their intellect if they could not tell\r\nwhether the wind blew up or down a valley, or on the back or front of\r\ntheir houses, and had failed to designate the several currents of the\r\natmosphere by distinct appellations, whereby to distinguish them when\r\nthey had occasion to speak of their effects. About the period of the\r\nTrojan war some inventive genius sprang up who gave a name to the north\r\nand the south winds, and already in the time of Homer the Greeks had\r\ncontrived to have four points to their compass, at least the poet speaks\r\nbut of the four cardinal winds, Boreas, the north; Euros, the east;\r\nNotos, the south, and Zephyros, the west. To these other four were\r\nafterwards added, and at the same time some change was introduced into\r\nthe ancient nomenclature, the north-east was called Cæcias;[1715] the\r\nsouth-east, Euros; the name of the east being changed to Apeliotes; the\r\nsouth-west, Libs; the north-west, Argestes, and sometimes\r\nOlympias,[1716] or Iapyx, or Sciron; which, however, according to Pliny\r\ndiffered from the Argestes, and was peculiar to Athens. These are the\r\nwinds represented on the tower of Andronicos Cyrrhestes at Athens,\r\nspoken of by Varro, Vitruvius,[1717] and many modern travellers.\r\nPliny,[1718] Galen, and Aulus Gellius differ from Aristotle in confining\r\nthe name of Aparctias to the north wind, and giving that of Boreas to\r\nthe north-east, or Aquilo of the Romans.[1719]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1714:\r\n\r\n  See Gœttling’s note on v. 379, of Hesiod’s Theogon. p. 38, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1715:\r\n\r\n  Called also Ἑλλησποντίας, by Aristot.

Prelim. ad Hippoc. § 61.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWinds blowing from the northern points of the compass are most frequent\r\nin Greece. Aristotle[1720] remarks, that Boreas is strong at its\r\ncommencement, but feeble towards its close; and that of the south wind,\r\nthe reverse is true.[1721] It may, moreover, be added, that the north\r\nwind was not only the most common, but also the dryest and most severe,\r\nthough sometimes accompanied by lightning, and hail, and snow. The same\r\nwind brought rain on the Hellespont, and at Cyrenè. The Cæcias commonly\r\nprevailed about the vernal equinox, and, in Attica and the islands, was\r\na rainy wind;[1722] the Apetiotes was a humid but soft wind felt chiefly\r\nin the morning.[1723] The Euros, which, as Gœttling[1724] observes, is\r\nthe Scirocco of the Italians, prevails about the winter solstice, and at\r\nfirst is warm and dry, but afterwards by blowing long over the sea\r\nbecomes moist, and brings rain, particularly in Lesbos.[1725] Aristotle,\r\nhowever, speaks of the Notos as the chief rainy wind in this\r\nisland,[1726] and observes what I have myself verified in the Delta,\r\nthat during the Simoom objects appear greater than their natural\r\nsize.[1727] The Notos blows chiefly about the end of autumn in Greece,\r\nas I found it also on the Nile immediately after the winter solstice,\r\nand at the commencement of spring.[1728] It likewise prevails during the\r\ndog-days[1729] (ἐπὶ κυνὶ). Naturally moist and warm, it was at first\r\nweak, but grew powerful as it drew towards its end, when it covered the\r\nsky with clouds and ended in rain.[1730] South winds blowing from the\r\nsea, by which they were cooled, were considered favourable to vegetation\r\nparticularly in the Thriasian plain in Attica, lying between the Sciros\r\nand the Cephissos. These same winds were supposed to be cold in Libya; I\r\nthink erroneously, since the south winds are warm in Egypt. The Libs is\r\nmoist and cloudy, though less so than the Cæcias; but the clouds which\r\nit brings are quickly dispersed; it blows chiefly about Cnidos and\r\nRhodes.[1731]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1720:\r\n\r\n  Meteorol. ii. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1721:\r\n\r\n  Problem. xxvi. 41.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1722:\r\n\r\n  Arist.

When about the winter solstice it happens to blow, it dries\r\nup and withers the trees more than long continued heats and\r\ndroughts.[1737] At Rhodes and at Cnidos it is usually accompanied by\r\nheavy clouds.[1738]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1732:\r\n\r\n  Ζέφυρος, τὴν ᾠδὴν τοῖς κύκνοις ἐνδιδοὺς.

These are weaker, more variable, and of briefer\r\nduration than the real Etesian winds, and I will add, from my own\r\nexperience, cover the sky with dark clouds, and blow extremely cold even\r\nalong the shores of Marmarica and Cyrenè. In ancient Greece they\r\nobtained the name of Ornithiæ—“the Bird Winds”—because they announced\r\nthe return of the birds.[1741] Or, according to another version of the\r\nmatter, because they were so cold as to strike dead various kinds of\r\nbirds during their flight, and strew the earth with their bodies.[1742]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1739:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

In proof\r\nof the violence of these aërial currents, which may almost be said to\r\nset steadily in one direction through a great portion of the year, it\r\nmay be observed, that in several of the islands neither vines nor\r\nfig-trees can be trained upright, but are blown down and compelled to\r\ncreep along the rocks.[1743] An example of the strength of the gales\r\nwhich sometimes also prevail on the Hellenic continent is recorded in\r\nhistory; during the retreat of Cleombrotos out of Bœotia, his army being\r\novertaken by a storm as it was traversing the mountain passes leading\r\nfrom Creusis to Ægosthena along the shore of the sea, numerous sumpter\r\nasses were blown with their ladings over the precipices; even the\r\nshields and arms were in many cases whirled from the hands of the\r\nsoldiers and precipitated into the waves below; and to prevent similar\r\nmisfortune the rest of the army turned their bucklers upside down and\r\nfilled them with stones, while they pushed forward, divested of\r\ndefensive armour, into the Megaris, a friendly country, from which they\r\nafterwards returned and fetched off their shields.[1744]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1743:\r\n\r\n  Thiersch, Etat Actuel de la Grèce. t. i. p. 284.

On the\r\ncoast of Thrace, in the neighbourhood of Salmydessos, where the whole\r\nmaritime population appear to have been confirmed wreckers, numerous\r\npillars were set up along the beach to mark the limits within which each\r\nlittle community might claim whatever booty was drifted in by the sea.\r\nPrevious to this arrangement, the barbarians used frequently to come to\r\nblows in the eager pursuit of this inhuman calling, and in these brawls\r\nmany lives were lost. Afterwards they appear to have carried on their\r\nwar against distressed mariners with perfect harmony and\r\nequanimity.[1745] But among the Rhodians, an enterprising mercantile\r\npeople, the amount of salvage was regulated by a law which, together\r\nwith the rest of their commercial code, was afterwards adopted by the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1745:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. Anab. vii. 5. 12, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf gold, or silver, or any other article, be brought up from the depth\r\nof eight cubits, the person who saves it shall receive one-third. If\r\nfrom fifteen cubits, the person who saves it shall, on account of the\r\ndepth, receive one-half. If goods are cast up by the waves towards the\r\nshore, and found sunk at the depth of one cubit, the person who carries\r\nthem out safe shall receive a tenth part.[1746] It was customary,\r\nmoreover, in old times, to keep a number of divers on board ships for\r\nthe purpose of descending to loosen the anchors when they chanced to\r\ntake too firm a hold in the sand, as also to recover goods which had\r\nbeen thrown overboard in times of danger.[1747]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1746:\r\n\r\n  Beckmann, History of Inventions, i. 180.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1747:\r\n\r\n  Lucian. Pharsal. iii. 697. Livius, xliv. 10. Manil. Astronom. 449.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn various headlands and promontories of the ancient world beacon-fires\r\nwere habitually kindled to guide the course of the ships into port; and\r\nfor these, in after ages, light-houses, adorned with every beauty of\r\narchitecture, and carried to a vast height, were substituted. Of these\r\nthe most remarkable was that erected for Ptolemy Philadelphus, by\r\nSostratos, the Cnidian, whose name, by permission of the king, was\r\ninscribed upon the structure.[1748] By one author it is described as\r\nfour hundred and fifty feet high, and equal in dimensions at the base to\r\none of the great pyramids of Memphis. In form it may possibly have\r\nresembled the Haram el Kedâb, which consists of a series of square\r\ntowers from the basement upwards, diminishing in size, and appearing to\r\nspring up out of each other. With this the language of Strabo[1749] very\r\nwell agrees, since he tells us, it was a building consisting of numerous\r\nstages. On the summit bright fires were kept perpetually burning, so\r\nthat on that low shore, where there is no hill or mountain for many\r\ndays’ journey, the Pharos was ever the first object which presented\r\nitself to mariners at sea, where its light, we are told, was visible at\r\nthe distance of a hundred miles. Occasionally, however, from its great\r\nsize and brilliance, it was mistaken for the moon, as this planet\r\nitself, rising behind the dome and towers of a great capital, has\r\nsuggested to distant beholders the idea of a conflagration.[1750]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1748:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

It\r\nwill not of course be understood, that all the articles enumerated in\r\nthe present chapters constituted at any one time the floating materials\r\nof Hellenic trade; the probability being, that some grew out of fashion\r\nand were succeeded by others, for which at a later period they may again\r\nhave been substituted. But the mind must suppose itself to be dealing\r\nwith the whole extent of authentic Grecian history, within the limits of\r\nwhich it will be found, that everything we here mention was trafficked\r\nin, though it seems to be now impossible to observe in these matters a\r\nstrict chronology and fix the epoch at which each particular commodity\r\ncame into vogue, or was abandoned for something else.\r\n\r\nAttica itself exported comparatively few of its own natural\r\nproductions;[1751] but having obtained the raw materials from other\r\nregions, it expended upon them so much skill, and taste, and industry,\r\nthat they appeared to undergo a new creation, and were issued from the\r\nPeiræeus like the native growth of the soil. This was the case with\r\nvarious kinds of arms and armour, as sabres, and scimitars, greaves,\r\ncuirasses, and helmets.[1752] These were sometimes richly gilt or inlaid\r\nwith gold, and adorned with embossed figures of rare workmanship.[1753]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1751:\r\n\r\n  Observing the plenty and prosperity always found in free states, Sir\r\n  Josiah Child observes, that good laws are sufficient of themselves to\r\n  render any region fertile.

Among the best\r\n  productions of Attica was its barley, though I nowhere remember to\r\n  have seen it said that it was exported: Ἀθήνῃσι δ᾽οὖν αἱ κριθαὶ τὰ\r\n  πλεῖστα ποιοῦσι τὰ ἄλφιτα· κριθοφόρος γὰρ ἀρίστη.

Thus strangers having observed\r\nthat the knolls and uplands of Attica were covered with thyme,[1760]\r\nwhich, flowering about midsummer, filled the air with sweetness, and\r\nenabled the owners of bees to foretell with exactness whether honey\r\nwould be scarce or plentiful, desired to transplant it to the\r\nneighbourhood of their own cities. It was found however by experience,\r\nthat it flourished and attained its natural luxuriance only in such\r\nsituations as were reached by the sea breezes.[1761] In Arcadia, for\r\nexample, it refused to be naturalised, though the climate of that\r\ncountry was found to agree very well with the marjoram, and the summer\r\nsavory. Among the simples employed by the ancients in their materia\r\nmedica were the Attic valerian,[1762] hemlock,[1763] and melilot.[1764]\r\nKermes also were produced in this country.[1765]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1760:\r\n\r\n  Ægialeus appears, for example, to have been no less celebrated for its\r\n  thyme than Hymettos.

With the\r\nMegaris, which once formed part of her own territory, Athens, at\r\nparticular periods of her history, carried on an active traffic in the\r\ncommon necessaries of life,—as groats,[1791] fish,[1792] salt,[1793]\r\ngoats, vegetables,[1794] leverets, poultry, pigs, and cattle.[1795]\r\nHemlock was likewise numbered among the exports of Megara,[1796]\r\ntogether with jars,[1797] and rough upper garments.[1798] It seems\r\nprobable moreover that, as numerous sheep were reared in this territory,\r\nfine wool was likewise on occasions imported thence into Attica,[1799]\r\ntogether with the rich sweet wine made at Ægosthena.[1800]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1790:\r\n\r\n  Ἐπεισέρχεται δὲ διὰ μέγεθος τῆς πόλεως ἐκ πάσης γῆς τὰ πάντα· καὶ\r\n  ξυμβαίνει ἡμῖν μηδὲν οἰκειότερα τῇ ἀπολαύσει τὰ αὐτοῦ ἀγαθὰ γιγνόμενα\r\n  καρποῦσθαι, ἢ καὶ τὰ τῶν ἄλλων ἄνθρώπων.

In the matter\r\nof corn these divisions of Greece were alternately exporters and\r\nimporters according, probably, to the fluctuations of the season or\r\npeculiar exigencies created by the accidents of peace or war.[1801] They\r\nperpetually, however, supplied their neighbours with cheese and wine,\r\nand various other articles of use or luxury.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1801:\r\n\r\n  See above, Book vi. chap. 9.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe poet Alcman celebrates a fragrant wine produced in the vicinity of\r\nSparta,[1802] but it is nowhere stated whether it was exported or not.\r\nThe little state of Phlius produced likewise a superior wine which was\r\nesteemed at Athens.[1803] Laconia exported cheese, which, being shipped\r\nat Gythium,[1804] was commonly supposed to be made at that place. The\r\ncheese of Tromileia in Achaia enjoyed as great a reputation throughout\r\nGreece, as the Parmasan in modern Europe. It was remarkable for the\r\nextreme delicacy of its flavour, and was made from goat’s milk with the\r\njuice of the fig-tree instead of rennet.[1805] Sicyon carried on a\r\nconsiderable trade in salted conger.[1806]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1802:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 57.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1803:\r\n\r\n  Id. i. 49.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1804:\r\n\r\n  Lucian.

The canton\r\nwhich most abounded in this plant seems to have been the country round\r\nPheneon in Arcadia.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1807:\r\n\r\n  Ἀστράγαλος, Dioscor. iv. 62. “Peut-on rien voir de plus beau, en fait\r\n  de plantes, qu’un Astragale de deux pieds de haut, chargé de fleurs\r\n  depuis le bas jusques à l’extremité de ses tiges?” Tournefort, Voyage\r\n  du Levant, t. iii. p. 101.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Psophis in the same state, the cultivation of\r\nthe heraclean all-heal[1808] was carried on to a great extent, as\r\nArcadia traded largely in this article of the materia medica. The juice\r\nwas collected in two ways, and at two different seasons of the year;\r\nfirst from the root when the plant began to germinate in spring. A small\r\ntrench having been excavated about it, an incision was made in the root\r\nand a number of broad leaves spread around to receive the liquor which\r\nflowed forth. This, at first white, assumed externally as it dried, a\r\nsaffron hue. The second method was to make an incision in the stem about\r\nharvest-time, when the fluid appears tog have been collected in the same\r\nmanner as before. Near Nonacris was obtained a poisonous water which\r\ndistilled slowly like dew from a rock. It was of a sharp and icy\r\ncoldness, and so bitter and acrid, that no vessel whatsoever could\r\ncontain it save the hoof of an ass, in which accordingly it was\r\npreserved.[1809]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1808:\r\n\r\n  Plin.

The neighbourhood of\r\nMantinea produced an excellent species of radish which was\r\nexported.[1816] Arcadia likewise produced, in its rich pastures, fine\r\nherds of cattle, together with asses and horses, no way inferior to\r\nthose of Thessaly.[1817]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1814:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. de Lapid. § 33.

Epidauros was remarkable\r\nfor its noble breed of horses;[1838] Corinth, which was frequently\r\nsupplied with corn from Epeiros, itself exported[1839] carpets, ladies’\r\nsummer mantles, linen tunics,[1840] articles of virtu in bronze and\r\ngold,[1841] and carbuncles variegated like those of Trœzen, with purple\r\nand white, but of a paler hue.[1842] Quinces[1843] of the richest colour\r\nand finest flavour, were found in this part of the isthmus; and probably\r\npears which were found every where else in Peloponnesos.

It had one handle, and the rim projecting\r\ninwards, kept back the grosser particles of mud contained in the water,\r\nor rather, perhaps, deceived the eye by its hue. It was, moreover, the\r\ncommon drinking vessel of sailors on board ship.[1855] The manufacture\r\nof these cups formed a distinct branch of business, the individuals\r\nengaged in which were called cothon-makers,[1856] to distinguish them\r\nfrom ordinary potters.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1854:\r\n\r\n  Suid. v. κώθων et κώθωνες, t. i. p. 1510. a. b.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1855:\r\n\r\n  Suid. v. κώθωνες, t. i. p. 1510. b.

It likewise, in later times at least,\r\nmanufactured for exportation massive gold plate curiously chased, which,\r\nunder the Macedonian kings, found its way to Egypt.[1858] Indeed these\r\nmilitary utilitarians appear to have excelled in the making of all\r\narticles of ordinary convenience, as couches, easy-chairs, and tables,\r\nwhich accordingly were much sought after.[1859] Doors have likewise been\r\nenumerated among Laconian exports,[1860] but with little probability,\r\nespecially when we recollect the directions given by the Spartan\r\nlegislator for the construction of this part of domestic defence;[1861]\r\nnor is it a jot more likely that the carts and waggons which the\r\nLacedæmonians constructed of smilax ever found their way beyond the\r\nborders of Laconia, unless employed in carrying provisions for its own\r\narmies.[1862]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1857:\r\n\r\n  Polem. ap.

For the daily consumption of life[1875] the Athenians obtained\r\nfrom this country a plentiful supply of poultry and wild-fowl,[1876]\r\nsuch as the francolin, the coot, ducks, divers, geese,[1877] jackdaws,\r\nand pyctides. Cats, too, were among the exports of Bœotia, (though\r\nwhether, as in Spain, they were substituted for rabbits at table, seems\r\nhard to determine,) together with foxes, moles, otters, hares, and\r\nhedgehogs.[1878]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1875:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph.

The wheat of Bœotia, where\r\nsuch is the fertility of the soil, that it returns fifty for one, was of\r\nold observed to be so heavy and full of nourishment, that the\r\nathletæ[1880] considered a chœnix and a half of it as equal to two\r\nchœnices of that produced in Attica. If any country, therefore, could,\r\nin the matter of bread, have been expected to be independent of its\r\nneighbours, it would doubtless have been Bœotia, which, nevertheless, we\r\nfind importing, in times of scarcity, corn from Thessaly.[1881]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1879:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

(Tournefort, t. iii.\r\n  p. 74, sqq.) This, apparently, was the honey that produced effects so\r\n  extraordinary upon the Ten Thousand, (Xenoph.

Della Rocca, i. 352, seq. Another cause of the\r\n  bitterness of the Colchian honey is assigned by Lamberti: “Ils mettent\r\n  quelquefois leur miel dans des écorces de citrouilles amères, ce qui a\r\n  peut-être donné sujet à Strabon, [l. xi. c. 2. t. ii. p. 409,\r\n  Tauchnitz.] d’en parler comme il a fait, et il est vrai aussi que\r\n  celui qu’on ramasse dans les montagnes, dans le tems que le\r\n  laurier-rose est en fleur, fait vomir ceux qui en prennent: si bien\r\n  que les païsans, faute d’autre remède, s’en servent pour se purger.”\r\n  Voyages au Nord, t. vi. p. 197.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1983:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. iii. 2.

It was obtained as\r\nwell on the continent as from the island of Besbicos, now\r\nKalolimno.[1996] A very similar substance, called Adarces, was found in\r\nCappadocia,[1997] about the rivers and marshes, where it hung suspended\r\non the tops of reeds. Aconite[1998] and origany came from the country of\r\nthe Maryandinians,[1999] and agaric from Sarmatia,[2000] doubtless by\r\nway of the Dnieper.

The lapis\r\nlazuli[2003] of Scythia necessarily found its way into Greece by the\r\nBlack Sea, as did, likewise, the cinnabar of Colchis, said to have been\r\ndiscovered amid inaccessible rocks and precipices,[2004] whence it was\r\nbrought down by darts and arrows. Probably, also, brass was exported\r\nfrom Colchis.[2005] In the Homeric age great quantities of silver[2006]\r\nwould seem to have been obtained from the country of the Halizones, as\r\nin later ages of steel and iron from that part of Asia Minor inhabited\r\nby the Chalybes,[2007] who are said to have worked their mines naked.\r\nThe finest kind of minium was excavated from certain caverns in\r\nCappadocia,[2008] and transported by land to the city of Sinope, whence\r\nit was sent into Greece.[2009] It was of three kinds,—the one deep, the\r\nother extremely pale, and the third sort a shade between the two. There\r\nwere likewise in the same district mines of ochre, and both were so\r\ninfected with damp and malaria, that the workmen, as in our own\r\ncoalpits, were constantly in danger of their lives.[2010] Many of the\r\ncommodities of this place were probably distributed through Greece and\r\nAsia by the travelling merchants, who resorted, at the annual festival\r\nof the goddess, to the great fair of Komana.[2011]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2002:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. v. 121.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2003:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. de Lapid. § 55.

Every province of this\r\nfertile and beautiful division of Asia abounded in costly or useful\r\narticles of merchandise, and its roads and rivers incessantly poured\r\ntowards Greece not only the productions of its own soil, but those also\r\nof Central Asia, brought thither by the caravans from both shores of the\r\nCaspian. Gold dust[2012] was collected from the sands of the\r\nPactolos;[2013] marbles of the most brilliant whiteness were exported\r\nfrom Ephesos, (whose inhabitants decreed divine honours to the shepherd\r\nPyxodoros,[2014] by whom the quarries were discovered), and from Synnada\r\nin Phrygia;[2015] large veins of lapis specularis, a stone so\r\ntransparent[2016] that it served the ancients instead of glass for\r\nwindows, were found in Cappadocia; the precious gem called\r\nalabandine[2017] was procured from the district round Miletos, jet[2018]\r\nfrom Lycia, not far from the river Gagas, and the fortress Plagiopolis.\r\nThe places whence this mineral is chiefly obtained at present are\r\nInspruck, in the Tyrol,[2019] where it is rolled down by the waters of a\r\ncertain stream, and Wirtemberg,[2020] where it is wrought into all kinds\r\nof ornaments.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2012:\r\n\r\n  Gold was likewise obtained from a place on the shores of the\r\n  Propontis, lying between Lampsacos and Abydos.

Basalt and the green marble\r\ncalled verdello are now often used instead of it in making experiments\r\non the purity of gold.[2022] From this part of the world also was first\r\nobtained that extraordinary stone whose properties slightly observed by\r\nthe ancients have since effected so wonderful a change in the science of\r\nnavigation; I mean the magnet, found originally in Lydia, near the city\r\nof Heraclea.[2023]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2021:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. de Lapid. § 47.

It was found, as at present, on the shores of Lake Tatta,\r\non which account it obtained the name of the Tattæan salt.[2027] A\r\ncauseway traverses the lake nearly through the centre, as in the case of\r\nthe lake Tritonis in northern Africa.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2025:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. v. 123.

That of Magnesia, in Caria, was\r\nesteemed inferior. From Colophon,[2029] in early times was obtained that\r\nliquid resin which distils from the pine and pitch trees, on which\r\naccount it obtained the name of Colophonia.[2030]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2028:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. v. 130.

Herb mastic,[2035] resembling origany in fragrance, was produced\r\nin Magnesia and around the Lydian city of Tralles. Both Lydia and\r\nCilicia exported saffron.[2036] That, however, which enjoyed among the\r\nancients the greatest celebrity grew upon the heights of Mount\r\nCorycos,[2037] in the neighbourhood of the Corycian cave.[2038]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2031:\r\n\r\n  Plin.

The commodities furnished to\r\ncommerce by the various groups and larger islands of the Ægæan and\r\nIonian seas scarcely yielded in number to those of Asia Minor. Of these\r\nthe most important were the wines, which fluctuated in value, strength,\r\nand flavour, according to the soil, temperature, and elevation above the\r\nsea, of the vineyards which produced them.\r\n\r\nThe island of Lesbos, during the flourishing ages of the Athenian\r\nrepublic, formed part, as it were, of the territory of that great\r\nmaritime state which compelled it to carry its wines exclusively to\r\nAthens.[2110] Among these was the Pramnian,[2111] which, also produced\r\nin Achaia, was a strong, harsh wine, apparently resembling port. Most,\r\nhowever, of the islands,[2112] both large and small, supplied wine—as\r\nTenedos,[2113] Chios,[2114] Cypros,[2115] which furnished, among others,\r\na curious fig wine;[2116] Thasos,[2117] where one particular kind was\r\nsomniferous,[2118] Peparethos, Lesbos, Eubœa,[2119] Crete, where among\r\nothers was found the Malmsey;[2120] Leucadia, Cos,[2121] and Corcyra.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2110:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vii. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2111:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 55.

The Thasians,\r\nlikewise, cultivated an inferior kind of barley which, from the extreme\r\nproductiveness of the island, seems occasionally to have been exported,\r\nthough I remember no authority in proof of the fact. Samos furnished\r\nGreece with the best olive oil next to that of Attica.[2124]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2122:\r\n\r\n  Herod. v. 31.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2123:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iii. 77.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2124:\r\n\r\n  Id. ii. 74.

There, in the earlier ages, the\r\nPhœnicians discovered and worked gold mines which in after times became\r\nexhausted, but the fertility of the island and the industry of its\r\ninhabitants seem never to have failed. From hence were exported\r\nradishes,[2125] fish sauce, pickles,[2126] almonds, and walnuts,[2127]\r\nwith the trees of which the island was thickly shaded.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2125:\r\n\r\n  Athen. ii. 48.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2126:\r\n\r\n  Schol.

The\r\nsecond of the Lemnian earths[2150] was reddle, and the third fullers’\r\nearth. The first of these earths, of a slight red colour, was sometimes\r\ndenominated sacred, apparently because used in sacrifices.

The road\r\nleading thither, after arriving at the chapel of Sotira, is divided, and\r\nbranches off to the right and left. Both ways pass by a fountain; the\r\none on the right bordered with elder, willow, and carob trees, by one\r\nwhich, though closely shaded from the sun’s rays, fails in summer; while\r\nthat on the left conducts to a spring which, lying in a marshy spot,\r\nproducing nothing but rushes, is perennial. Both these fountains are\r\nsituated among the roots of the hill, now ascended by steps cut in the\r\nrock, but anciently by a road practicable all the way to the summit. The\r\ndigging of the Lemnian earth appears to have been always under the\r\nprotection of religion; for, during the operation, a priest anciently\r\nstood on the mountain near the mine, and, after having made a sort of\r\nlibation of corn, which was cast as an offering upon the ground, and\r\nperformed various other ceremonies, caused a waggon to be laden with the\r\nearth and conducted to the city, where it was prepared, sealed, and sold\r\nto merchants.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2151:\r\n\r\n  Dapper, Description des Iles de l’Archipel. p. 245. In the island of\r\n  Cea there were regular pits whence the best reddle was obtained. That\r\n  found in iron mines was esteemed inferior. Theoph. de Lapid. § 52.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn modern times, ever since the period when the Venetians were in\r\npossession of the island, a different and more cumbrous set of\r\nceremonies has been practised.[2152] The principal inhabitants of the\r\nisland, both Turks and Christians, assembling on the sixth of August,\r\nmarch out in grand procession to the mountains of sealed earth, halting\r\nby the way at the chapel of Sotira, where the priests chant the liturgy\r\nof the Greek church, and repeat many prayers, after which they ascend\r\nthe acclivity. Arrived at the summit, fifty or sixty stout men commence\r\nexcavating in search of the stratum of precious clay, which being found,\r\nthe priests fill therewith a number of skin sacks, which they deliver to\r\nthe custody of the Subashi.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2152:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Busbeq. Epist. iii. p. 214, seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen a sufficient quantity has been procured the mouth of the mine is\r\nclosed, and never opened again until that day twelvemonths. A certain\r\nquantity is then despatched to the Sultan, who distributes it in\r\npresents to princes and monarchs. The remainder is sold as of old to the\r\nmerchants. It is quite possible that this substance might be discovered\r\nin other parts of the island; but the Greeks would set no value upon it\r\nunless obtained from the spot in question, and excavated with the proper\r\nceremonies. For any private individual to attempt digging it is a\r\ncapital offence.\r\n\r\nCopper dross or tutty[2153] was obtained from the muddy bottom of a\r\ncopper mine in Cypros.[2154] Having been exposed to dry in the sun, a\r\nquantity of brushwood was cast around it and set on fire, by which means\r\nit underwent a second calcination, and thence obtained the name of\r\ndiphryges, or twice-burned.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2153:\r\n\r\n  Διφρυγὲς, Dioscor. v. 120.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2154:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

It was generated in the following manner: the furnaces\r\nin which they smelted copper were constructed of iron arched above, and\r\nof very large dimensions. As the metal underwent the action of the fire,\r\nthe lighter and mere aërial particles, detaching themselves from the\r\nmolten mass, ascended like sparks, rolling upwards along the sides of\r\nthe furnace and settling on the roof.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2155:\r\n\r\n  Plin.

In these\r\nextraordinary mountains were found veins of copper ore,[2157] sulphate\r\nof copper,[2158] sory,[2159] verdigris,[2160] lapis lazuli,[2161]\r\nchrysocolla,[2162] copperas, and tutty.[2163]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2156:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. v. 84.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2157:\r\n\r\n  Χαλκῖτις.

The bellows were\r\nworked in an adjoining apartment, the snout passing through a wall into\r\nthe furnace, with which the workman was enabled to communicate by a\r\nsmall door. The fossil Cadmian-stone having been broken into small\r\npieces was cast into the fire through an aperture from above, after\r\nwhich the flames having been blown up to greater fierceness, the mineral\r\nconverted itself into a dense white vapour, and a cloud of fiery sparks\r\nascended through the mouth of the furnace, the lighter particles\r\nattaching themselves like white bubbles or flocks of wool to the walls\r\nand vaulted roof of the building, while the heavier, after cooling, fell\r\nback into the flames or were scattered about the floor, where they\r\nindurated and formed a sort of incrustation. This coarser and weightier\r\nsubstance was usually found when scraped off to contain hairs,\r\nsplinters, and particles of earth, and received the name of spodion,\r\nwhile that detached from the walls or roof was either milk-white or\r\nazure, and was what we now denominate flowers of zinc.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of manufacturing this article was to cast the fossil\r\nCadmia, reduced to powder, on the surface of the liquid metal in bronze\r\nfurnaces which caused a similar evaporation. Spodion was likewise\r\nprocured from gold, silver, and lead, and next after the above this last\r\nwas considered the best.\r\n\r\nNear the village of Amianthos was a celebrated asbestos quarry whose\r\nproduce, a greyish filamentous stone, was carded like wool and spun and\r\nwoven into cloth[2172] which when soiled was cast into the fire instead\r\nof being washed, and came forth brilliant and pure as from the loom,\r\nthough at each burning it lost something of its weight. In cerecloths of\r\nasbestos the bodies of kings and illustrious personages were burned, in\r\nantiquity, to preserve their remains from mingling with the ashes of the\r\npyre.[2173] Matches likewise were made of this substance, more\r\nparticularly for those durable lamps which were kindled by the Pagans in\r\nsepulchres,[2174] and supposed to burn on for ever. Other quarries of\r\nasbestos were found in Cypros, chiefly at the foot of the precipices\r\nbordering the road leading from Gerandium to Soli.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2172:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. v. 156.

When rubbed with oil and exposed to the action of the air it\r\nbecame black and hard, and resembled the finest pottery:[2175] similar\r\nstones are in modern times brought from the island of Minorca.[2176]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2175:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. de Lapid. § 42.

It was found\r\nanciently in a pool, about seventy feet in circumference, and of very\r\ngreat depth, situated in a small valley on the sea-shore nearly\r\nencircled by mountains. The tar ascended from the bottom in bubbles as\r\nlarge as a cannon-ball, through the clear water, and on reaching the\r\nsurface spread over the pond in a kind of film.

C’étoit dans la\r\n  plus grande chaleur du jour, et il ne faisoit pas de vent: cette\r\n  disposition du temps est nécessaire pour amasser le ladanum. Sept ou\r\n  huit paysans en chemise et en caleçon, rouloient leurs fouets sur ces\r\n  plantes: à force de les secouer et de les frotter sur les feuilles de\r\n  cet arbuste, leurs courroyes se chargeoient d’une espèce de glu\r\n  odoriférante, attachée sur les feuilles; c’est une partie du suc\r\n  nourricier de la plante, lequel transude au travers de la tissure de\r\n  ces feuilles comme une sueur grasse, dont les gouttes sont luisantes,\r\n  et aussi claires que la térébenthine.

Malta supplied the idle and luxurious ladies\r\nof Greece with a domestic kind of lap-dogs.[2257] Sciathos was famous\r\nfor its mullets; Melos exported kids;[2258] Naxos and Scyros, milch\r\ngoats and lobsters;[2259] Leros, guinea fowl; Samos, peacocks; and\r\nCypros, hairy sheep[2260] and doves.[2261] Among the wild and almost\r\ninaccessible cliffs of modern Crete is found a species of blue\r\nnightingale,[2262] in size somewhat inferior to the thrush, which it\r\nresembled in the richness and variety of its notes. This bird is often\r\ncaught and kept in cages, where it is sometimes taught to imitate the\r\nhuman voice. Occasionally it forms an article of traffic, and is\r\nexported into Italy; but if the ancients traded in these birds, the\r\npassage in which it may be mentioned has escaped me. In the same island\r\nis found an elegant sort of merops which darts in flocks along the sides\r\nof the thymy mountains in pursuit of the bees, which delight in those\r\nfragrant places. It is of rich and variegated plumage like the\r\nparrokeet. The children take it in a very ingenious manner; passing a\r\ncrooked pin with a fine thread attached through the hard corslet of the\r\ncicada, they let go the insect which mounts, thus transfixed, into the\r\nair. The merops, bold and voracious, immediately pounces upon and gorges\r\nit, when the pin sticks in the throat, the bird becomes hooked like a\r\nfish, and is easily drawn down and taken.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2256:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

This trade was in most instances of later origin than\r\nthat maintained with regions lying more to the East, but nevertheless\r\ncame at length to be of considerable importance, especially after the\r\nHellenic colonies in Italy and Sicily had risen to eminence. The cities\r\nfounded, moreover, on the coasts of Illyria exercised considerable\r\ninfluence over the commerce of Greece, by imparting to the rude natives\r\na taste for her productions and manufactures, and exciting them to the\r\nexercise of greater industry to supply suitable commodities in their\r\nturn. Nevertheless, the information we possess on this subject is\r\nextremely scanty.\r\n\r\nThe barn-door fowls of these regions,[2263] though inferior to those of\r\nGreece, and of a smaller size, were yet exported thither, simply because\r\nthey were foreign, while the natives on the contrary were eager to\r\nenrich their country with the breed of Attica. Wild turnips and\r\nparsnips,[2264] it has been remarked by the ancients, were found growing\r\nin Dalmatia;[2265] but as they abound in most other countries, it seems\r\nnot unreasonable to infer, from this particular mentioned of them, that\r\nthey were exported.[2266] The best iris, the odoriferous roots of which\r\nwere much used in the making of perfume, came from the interior of\r\nIllyria,[2267] where, having been dug up and cleared of the leaves, they\r\nwere strung on a linen cord and dried in the shade.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2263:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vii. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2264:\r\n\r\n  Id. ix. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2265:\r\n\r\n  Among the exports of this country gold, found in a virgin state, near\r\n  the surface of the earth, was at one time included: aurum ...\r\n  invenitur aliquando in summa tellure protinus, rara felicitate: ut\r\n  nuper in Dalmatia principatu Neronis, singulis diebus etiam\r\n  quinquagenas libras fundens.

The wines of the Adriatic shore were in no\r\ngreat request. That which was called Prætutian[2270] was light and\r\naromatic, and therefore deceived those who drank of it, being powerfully\r\nintoxicating and somniferous.

It exhaled a mingled\r\nodour of pitch and bitumen. Great quantities of salt[2273] were made in\r\nanother part of Illyria, where, during the spring, they took of the\r\nwater of a stream flowing forth from a cleft in the rock and poured it\r\ninto shallow pits exposed apparently to the sun and air, where it\r\nhardened in about five days into salt. The beans of Apollonia were\r\nfamous for keeping long.[2274] Other Illyrian commodities were slaves,\r\nampelitis,[2275] cattle, and skins, for which the natives received wine\r\nand oil, and other productions of civilised countries in return.[2276]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2271:\r\n\r\n  Leontinus, ap.

Of this article vast\r\nquantities, as much it is said as sixty tons per annum, were in the last\r\ncentury exported from hence into the inland parts of Africa, as Æthiopia\r\nand Abyssinia,[2285] where it was chiefly used in softening and\r\nrendering shining the skin. Another export of Italy was the Ligurian\r\nall-heal,[2286] from the lofty and umbrageous summits of the Apennines,\r\nwhere it flourished chiefly along the edge of the water-courses.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2277:\r\n\r\n  Lucian.

Connoisseurs\r\nin snails find a great difference in their flesh, according to the\r\nplants and trees on which they pasture.

These stones\r\nare preserved both at Rome and at Naples in cellars, for the production\r\nof mushrooms. Occasionally, however, contrivances of this sort prove\r\nfatal. In a convent in France where the nuns cultivated mushrooms on a\r\nhot bed in a cellar, the noisome exhalations destroyed several persons\r\nsent down to collect them.[2293]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2290:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. iv. 83.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2291:\r\n\r\n  Martin Mathée, Notes sur Dioscoride, p. 385.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2292:\r\n\r\n  Id. ib.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2293:\r\n\r\n  Valmont de Bomare, Dict. d’Hist.

Around that of Gaul the imagination\r\nhad woven a tissue of terrors almost equal to that which modern times\r\nhave cast about the upas; for, to sleep, or even to recline, beneath its\r\nshade, was supposed to cause dangerous maladies and occasionally even\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2294:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. iv. 80.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe plant of most deadly qualities known to the ancients grew\r\nplentifully in the mountains of the Vestini, neighbours of the\r\nSabines.[2295] It was identical in nature with that of Pontos, and many\r\nextraordinary circumstances are related of its effects. By the mere\r\ntouch it was said to possess the power to benumb the scorpion, which\r\nagain recovered its activity if brought in contact with the hellebore.\r\nIt was used by hunters in the chace to destroy wild beasts, and by\r\nphysicians for various purposes. At present it appears to be found\r\nchiefly among the recesses of the Rhætian Alps, from whence it passes to\r\nthe Papal States and the kingdom of Naples, in both which countries\r\nthere is a particular class of men whose sole occupation is the\r\nextirpation of wolves, and who formerly used to sell this poison openly\r\non the bridge of St. Angelo, at Rome.[2296]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2295:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. iv. 77, seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2296:\r\n\r\n  Martin Mathée, Notes sur Dioscoride, p. 382.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAmong the other exports of Italy may be enumerated the squills of\r\nMinturnæ,[2297] which exceeded in size those of Smyrna, and the lobsters\r\nof Alexandria: amber, too, and coal, of which there are said to have\r\nbeen mines in Liguria,[2298] found their way into the channels of\r\ncommerce.

The nourishing quality of\r\nthis fruit was experienced by the army of Ophella,[2449] which\r\nproceeding across the desert, to attack the Carthaginians, was reduced\r\nto subsist upon it entirely for several days. It is about the size of a\r\nwhite cherry and straw-coloured, excepting on the side next the sun,\r\nwhich has a ruddy blush: the best are said to be without stones, but\r\nthose which are produced in the Saïd have very large ones. Whether it\r\nhas yet been introduced into England I know not; I myself, however, made\r\nthe attempt in pots placed in a warm room; but on the first frosty night\r\nof autumn the plants perished entirely, with all the silk trees I had\r\nplanted at the same time.

In the neighbourhood of Memphis was found a sort of\r\nvariegated pebbles, which, being broken and reduced to powder, were used\r\nby surgeons when about to apply the knife or the cautery in dulling the\r\nsense of pain, which it effected completely without danger.[2493]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2489:\r\n\r\n  Id. v. 119.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2490:\r\n\r\n  Αἱματίτης.

The nitre[2496] of Egypt was superior to that of\r\nLydia.[2497] Aloes, likewise,[2498] and the fine sand for the gymnasia\r\nwere supplied by this country.[2499] The best burnt copper was exported\r\nfrom Egypt, where it was prepared as follows in the neighbourhood of\r\nMemphis.[2500] Taking a number of copper nails from ships decayed and\r\nfallen to pieces, they piled them in unbaked jars, alternating with\r\nlayers of earth and sulphur of equal weight, which, having been well\r\nluted, were then placed in red-hot furnaces, where they were kept until\r\nthe jars were thoroughly baked.

Copper thus calcined assumed a red colour, and, when\r\npounded in Theban mortars and repeatedly washed with rain water,\r\nresembled cinnabar or minium.[2501] It was usually kept by physicians in\r\nboxes of bronze.

With respect to the\r\nexports of Phœnicia we can say but little in this place, as it collected\r\ntogether the wealth of the whole ancient world, which it again\r\ndistributed according to the tastes and wants of various countries.\r\nThus, we find, that from Egypt the merchandise borne to Tyre consisted\r\nof fine linen, with broidered work, which was used in sails on her\r\ngalleys; blue and purple from the Ægæan; silver, iron, tin, and\r\nlead,[2511] from Cilicia; slaves and brazen vessels from Javan, Tubal,\r\nand Meschech; horses and mules from Kùrdistân; ivory and ebony from the\r\nshores of the Persian gulf; emeralds, purple and broidered work, fine\r\nlinen, coral, and agates, from Syria; wheat of Minnith and Pannag,\r\nhoney, oil, and balms, from Judea; and white wool and the wine of Helbon\r\nfrom Damascus. Among the other exports of Tyre were bright iron, cassia,\r\nand calamus; Arabia furnished her with lambs, rams, and goats, spices,\r\nprecious stones, and gold, blue cloths and broidered work, and chests of\r\nrich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar.[2512]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2504:\r\n\r\n  Herod. i. 193.

The tree itself, at present found to flourish in several\r\nregions of the East, resembled in size that of the pomegranate,\r\nspreading into numerous branches and covered with an evergreen foliage,\r\nin form like the leaves of rue, though in colour lighter. Its fruit\r\nresembled the terebinth-berries both in hue and size.

The\r\nproduce of the large garden during the whole year did not exceed six\r\nchoes, that of the smaller one a chous. The balsam, when it issued from\r\nthe tree, was liquid, somewhat resembling milk in colour, and about the\r\nconsistence of oil. It was sometimes collected on flocks of wool and\r\nsqueezed into small horns, from whence it was transferred to fictile\r\nvases. This substance was so fragrant that the smallest particle\r\nperfumed the atmosphere to a considerable distance. It is now seldom\r\nfound unadulterated in Europe. Pompey carried the balsam-tree in his\r\ntriumph at Rome, and Vespasian afterwards brought another specimen into\r\nItaly.[2519]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2519:\r\n\r\n  Plin. Nat. Hist. xii. 34.

From the green plants\r\nno perfume exhaled, but when they were cut down and laid to dry in the\r\nsun there issued from them a delicate fragrance which impregnated the\r\nwhole air, and, as some fabulously pretended, could be detected by\r\nmariners approaching the shore at a distance of more than a hundred and\r\nfifty stadia.[2545]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2544:\r\n\r\n  Strab. xvi. t. ii. p. 1095.

For this reason it obtained the name of aphroselenon or\r\nmoonstone.[2555] From a belief in its hidden virtues women wore it about\r\ntheir necks as an amulet against enchantment. It was likewise suspended\r\nupon trees to augment their bearing. Eagle-stones[2556] were also a\r\nproduction of Arabia, together with certain fine white stones which when\r\ncalcined were used as a dentrifice.[2557]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2553:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

This traveller\r\n  gives, from the traditions of the natives, a fabulous explanation of\r\n  the origin of the pearls, which is exceedingly fanciful and poetical:\r\n  “It is generally believed that these pearls are progenerated by the\r\n  May dews, during which month the oysters rise up to the surface of the\r\n  waters, and opening themselves receive a small quantity of dew, which,\r\n  being coagulated, afterwards produces these pearls. Certain it is,\r\n  that, if these oysters are opened before June, the pearls are soft and\r\n  pliable like pitch.” Churchill’s Collection of Voyages, vol. ii. p.\r\n  196.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe plains of the Arabian wastes have in all ages been covered at\r\nintervals with forests of palm-trees. Dates, therefore, from the\r\nearliest times, have been among the exports of the peninsula. The manner\r\nof climbing the trees in the fruit season was much the same in antiquity\r\nas at present. The person about to ascend made with a cord a loop\r\ninclosing both his own body and the tree, which warping up as he mounted\r\nenabled him to rest at intervals.[2560]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2560:\r\n\r\n  Lucian. de Syr. Dea, § 29.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the soil, sandy and arid, exposed almost perpetually to a burning\r\nsun, delights above all things in the production of thorny shrubs and\r\ntrees, whose gum and resin, from the united virtues of the climate and\r\nthe earth, are nearly all fragrant and medicinal.[2561] Of these some\r\nare still in use, while others have disappeared from commerce, or are\r\nknown under different names. Among the latter was the cancamon, a\r\nstrongly odoriferous gum used by physicians, introduced into the\r\nmanufacture of odoriferous unguents, and mingled with myrtle and styrax\r\nfor perfuming apparel.[2562] Among the former were the ladanum,[2563]\r\nthe myrrh, and the frankincense,[2564] of which the ancient naturalists\r\nhave left us an interesting account. It was produced, they say, in the\r\nterritory of the Sabæeans about Mamali, Citibaina and Adramytta, now\r\nHadramaut. Both the frankincense and the myrrh trees grew partly on the\r\nmountains, partly on private grounds at their roots, where they were\r\ncultivated, while the others, apparently, were left to the\r\nsuperintendence of nature. The favoured ridges adorned by these aromatic\r\nplantations are said to have been extremely lofty, covered with woods\r\nand clad above with snow, while from their slope and summits numerous\r\nstreams poured down to the plains.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2561:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

The\r\nfoliage, though more diminutive, resembles in form that of the\r\npear-tree, but its verdure approaches the light colour of the rue. In\r\nsmoothness the bark everywhere, both on trunk and branches, resembles\r\nthat of the laurel. The myrrh-tree is still smaller, and more like a\r\nshrub. Its stem clothed with a smooth bark, and about the thickness of a\r\nman’s leg, is extremely tough and twisted towards the root. In character\r\nits foliage has at once been compared to the elm and the scarlet\r\noak,—rough, pointed, and uneven, and armed at the edges with thorns.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2565:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Diodor. Sicul. l. v. t. i. p. 364. Wesseling.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOf myrrh there were various kinds, deriving their different qualities\r\nfrom the nature of the soil or from the manner in which the gum was\r\nobtained from its tree, some being thick and unctuous, and abounding in\r\nthat sweet oil called stactè,[2566] while other kinds were light, clean,\r\nand transparent. These accounts appear to have been obtained from\r\neye-witnesses. Certain mariners, we are told, setting sail from the gulf\r\nof Heroes, now Suez, and arriving in the frankincense country, landed in\r\nsearch of water.[2567] During this excursion they advanced as far as the\r\nmountains, where they observed the appearance of the trees and the\r\nmanner of collecting the gum. Incisions, they related, were made in the\r\ntrunk and the branches, some large, as with a hatchet, others smaller.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2566:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. i. 79.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2567:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. Hist. Plant. ix. 4. 7.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom some of these the frankincense rained upon the ground, while in\r\nother parts it issued forth more slowly, thickening as it flowed. Mats\r\nof palm leaves were by some proprietors spread on all sides under the\r\ntree, which thus appeared to spring from a carpeted floor, while others\r\nmerely levelled the soil and swept it.[2568] The frankincense, however,\r\nwhich fell upon the mats was more pure and pellucid than the other,\r\nwhich necessarily attracted some particles of earth. What remained\r\nsticking to the trees was severed with a knife, on which account it\r\nsometimes contained small splinters of bark. The superior kinds were\r\ngenerally found in commerce of a globular form, into which it was said\r\nto have run at the first. In colour it was white, unctuous when broken,\r\nand immediately kindled at the approach of flame. That which was brought\r\nfrom India in colour somewhat yellow and livid, was manufactured into\r\ngrains by art; for, having been pressed into a mass, it was cut into\r\nsmall square pieces which were cast into a vessel and shaken until they\r\nassumed a round form.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2568:\r\n\r\n  See also Dioscor. i. 77. A fable concerning the collection of the\r\n  frankincense occurs in Herod. iii. 117.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same observer affirmed, that the whole of this mountain tract was\r\ndivided among the Sabæans, who were the lords of that part of the\r\ncountry, and distinguished for their justice, on which account the trees\r\nrequired no watching. They were further informed, that both the myrrh\r\nand the frankincense when collected were conveyed on camels to the\r\nTemple of the Sun, the holiest place in the country of the Sabæans, and\r\ncontinually guarded by armed men. When the precious merchandise had been\r\nborne thither, each person piled his own property in a separate heap, on\r\nthe top of which placing a tablet declaring its weight and value, they\r\ncommitted it to the care of the temple wardens.\r\n\r\nWhen the merchants arrived they inspected the tablets, and if satisfied\r\nwith the price took possession of the merchandise, leaving the value in\r\nits place. The transaction being concluded, the priest, according to\r\nsome authorities, appropriated one-third of the proceeds to the service\r\nof the gods; but others speak with more probability of a tenth, which\r\nseems, everywhere in the ancient world, to have been consecrated to the\r\nservice of religion. The remainder was kept for the owners until they\r\narrived to claim it.\r\n\r\nThe frankincense produced by young trees was of a pale white colour, but\r\nless fragrant than the gum of older trees, which was of a deep yellow.\r\nThe former probably was what was called Amomites, which possessing\r\nlittle consistence easily melted like gum-mastic, by the touch of the\r\nhand. On the way to Greece it was frequently adulterated with fine resin\r\nand common gum; but the imposture was easily detected because the gum\r\nrefused to burn, and the resin resolved itself into smoke, whereas the\r\nfrankincense yielded a clear flame. In the opinion of many the best kind\r\nwas brought from Arabia, though in colour it was deemed inferior to the\r\nproduce of the neighbouring islands. Connected with the natural history\r\nof this production, a circumstance is related which seems to have been\r\nviewed by the ancients in the light of a prodigy. In the grounds of a\r\ntemple near Sardis[2569] a species of frankincense tree sprang forth\r\nspontaneously from the earth, having a smooth bark like the laurel, and\r\nshedding a gum resembling that of the Arabian perfume.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2569:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. Hist. Plant. ix. 4. 7.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe numerous groves of frankincense trees which covered the hills and\r\nvalleys of southern Arabia, constantly distilling their sweet gums, are\r\nsaid to have impregnated the whole atmosphere with their delicious\r\nfragrance, which, when the breezes prevailed off the land, was wafted\r\nout many leagues from the shore. To this Milton alludes in the well\r\nknown lines:[2570]\r\n\r\n                        As when to them who sail\r\n        Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past\r\n        Mozambic, off at sea north-east winds blow\r\n        Sabæan odours from the spicy shore\r\n        Of Araby the Blest: with such delay\r\n        Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league\r\n        Cheer’d with the grateful smell, old Ocean smiles.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2570:\r\n\r\n  Paradise Lost, iv. 159-165.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNor is this to be regarded as a mere poetical figure of speech. Sir\r\nThomas Herbert,[2571] sailing up the Persian gulf on his return from the\r\nEast Indies, found the atmosphere of the ocean perfumed by the spirits\r\nissuing from the flowers of Arabia, and observes, that mariners while\r\nyet out of sight of land have discovered where they were by the\r\nprevalence of these odoriferous gales. The same effect has been observed\r\nin other parts of the world. Pernetty[2572] relates, that, on\r\napproaching the island of St. Catharine on the Brazil coast, the\r\nfragrance of its aromatic herbs and flowers may be detected at more than\r\nthree leagues. In dark nights, or hazy weather, the dogs on board a ship\r\nwill smell the land at considerable distance, so as in such cases to\r\nserve instead of a telescope.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2571:\r\n\r\n  Some years’ Travels into Africa and Asia, p. 102.

In\r\nthe country itself they seasoned their drinks and potages with the green\r\nleaves, as the Greeks usually did with rue.[2575]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2573:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. i. 80. Plin.

To prevent the god from being defrauded of his due\r\nshare, lots were drawn, and the portion which thus fell to him was piled\r\nup in a heap upon the sand. The Arabs then departed, but, having reached\r\na certain distance, usually turned back, when they were sure to behold\r\nthe portion of the sun on fire, and sending up its flames and smoke\r\ntowards the god to whom it appertained.[2578] It is clear from this,\r\nthat the natives of the Arabian peninsula had already begun to collect\r\nmaterials for “The Thousand and One Nights.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2578:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

Here, too, was\r\nfound another tree with leaves like the rose, which being fully expanded\r\nat noon contracted as the day advanced, and closed entirely at night,\r\nwhen the tree, by the natives, was said to sleep. The same thing, by the\r\npeople of India, is at present predicated of the Averrhoa Carambola.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2591:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Here\r\ngrew in abundance the date palm, the vine, the olive, the apple, and\r\nmost kinds of nuts, with fig trees which never shed their foliage. No\r\nvalue was set upon the moisture derived from the clouds; on the\r\ncontrary, when any showers fell, the inhabitants were careful\r\nimmediately afterwards to irrigate their plantations, as if to wash away\r\nthe rain. With this they were, in fact, enabled to dispense, on account\r\nof the number of fountains and streams of water which there\r\nabounded.[2594]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2594:\r\n\r\n  Theoph. Hist. Plant. iv. 7. 7, seq. At the present day, the water\r\n  actually found on the island is brackish, while the sea is thought by\r\n  some to have gained so far upon the land as to cover certain springs\r\n  which supplied the ancient inhabitants with excellent water. Even now,\r\n  however, the produce of these fountains is not wholly lost though\r\n  doubtless deteriorated by the admixture of sea-water. “There are\r\n  certain springs,” observes Nieuhoff, “arising in the bottom of the\r\n  sea, at three fathoms and a half deep. Near the city of Manama,\r\n  certain divers go early in the morning in boats, about three musket\r\n  shots from the land, and dive to the bottom of the sea, fill their\r\n  earthen or leathern vessels with the water that issues from the\r\n  springs, and so come up again and return to the shore.” Churchill’s\r\n  Collection, Vol. ii. p. 196.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom Mesopotamia, Persia, Armenia, and the adjacent countries, the\r\nGreeks obtained a number of valuable commodities, of which far too\r\nmeagre an account has been left us by the ancients. Of these the most\r\ncurious, however, may be said to have been the naphtha, or rock oil,\r\nwhich springs forth spontaneously from the earth in several parts of\r\nthose regions lying between the Caspian and the Persian gulf.[2595] The\r\nmost remarkable of their oil springs was found of old near Ecbatana, now\r\nHamadan, where Alexander was smitten with astonishment at beholding a\r\ntorrent of flame ascending perpetually out of the earth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2595:\r\n\r\n  For example, near the Oxus, where a Macedonian, named Proxenos, in the\r\n  act of pitching Alexander’s tent, discovered a spring of pure oil.\r\n  Even the waters of the Oxus were supposed by the ancients to contain\r\n  oily particles. Plut. Alexand. § 57. On the Persian sulphur, Polyæn.\r\n  Stratag. iv. 6. 11.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis everlasting fire was supplied through subterraneous channels with\r\nnaphtha, which in the vicinity welled forth from the soil and formed a\r\nsmall lake. This naphtha, clear, when pure, as fine oil, is, perhaps,\r\nthe most inflammable substance known, kindling by the invisible gases\r\nwhich surround it considerably before it comes into actual contact with\r\nfire. Several experiments illustrative of its qualities were performed\r\nfor the amusement of the son of Philip. In the first place certain\r\nPersians sprinkled with it the street leading to the royal quarters, and\r\nthen applying a torch to the earth at the farther end of it, the flame\r\nran along with the rapidity of thought, so that in an instant the whole\r\nstreet seemed to be converted into a channel of fire.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion one Athenophanes, a profligate buffoon who had\r\nabandoned the sweets of freedom at Athens to attend on the Macedonian\r\ntyrant, being along with his master in the bath, advised him in the true\r\nspirit of a courtier to make a cruel experiment of the power of the\r\nnaphtha on a poor youth named Stephanos, of homely person and comic\r\nexpression of face, but gifted with a magnificent voice, and who used\r\napparently to divert Alexander while bathing.\r\n\r\n“Shall we try the force of this substance on Stephanos? For, if it\r\nkindle and prove difficult to be extinguished on him its powers may\r\ntruly be said to be altogether strange and irresistible!”\r\n\r\nThe youth readily consented to encounter the peril. As soon, however, as\r\nhe had been anointed with it and brought near a fire the naphtha[2596]\r\ninstantaneously kindled, and his whole body was sheathed in flame to the\r\nextreme perplexity and terror of Alexander. He would, in fact, have been\r\nreduced to ashes had there not been at hand many persons bearing vessels\r\nof cold water for the baths, which pouring over him they with extreme\r\ndifficulty extinguished the flames. He, nevertheless, felt severely the\r\neffect of his royal master’s inhuman curiosity.[2597]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2596:\r\n\r\n  Strab. Casaub. xvi. t. ii. p. 1078. Sir Thomas Herbert’s account of\r\n  the Persian naphtha is not exactly consistent with that of Plutarch.\r\n  “This naphtha,” says he, “is an oily or fat liquid substance, in\r\n  colour not unlike soft, white clay; of quality hot and dry, so as it\r\n  is apt to inflame with the sunbeams, or heat that issues from fire, as\r\n  was mirthfully experimented upon one of Alexander’s pages, who, being\r\n  anointed, with much ado escaped burning.” Some Years’ Travels, p. 182.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2597:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Alexand. § 35.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCertain writers, desirous of giving an historical explanation of the\r\nlegends of the mythology, suppose the golden crown and veil sent by\r\nMedea to Creüsa, which utterly consumed her in the presence of her\r\nfamily, to have been smeared with naphtha;[2598] for the flames burst\r\nnot forth spontaneously from the ornaments themselves, but a fire\r\nburning near, they, by a subtle power, attracted its seeds and were\r\nkindled invisibly.[2599]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2598:\r\n\r\n  Eurip.

For, according to them, grains of barley being cast upon the\r\nsoil would leap up and rebound, for which, however, other causes might\r\nbe assigned. But the heat of the climate is undoubtedly prodigious, and,\r\nto mitigate it, we are told, the ancient inhabitants were accustomed to\r\nsleep on skins filled with water. Harpalos, who was made governor of the\r\nprovince by Alexander, laboured to acclimate there the trees and plants\r\nof Greece, and succeeded in everything excepting ivy which, delighting\r\nin a cold soil, could not be reconciled to the “temper of that fiery\r\nmould.”[2600]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2600:\r\n\r\n  This expression is Dr. Langhorne’s, t. v. p. 239.

Persia likewise exported gold solder,[2609]\r\nonyx shells,[2610] whetstones,[2611] and jaspers,[2612] one kind of\r\nwhich was intersected with white veins. Amulets of this stone were much\r\nused in incantations. From the province of Bactriana emeralds of great\r\nbeauty, but of small size, were procured for the studding of costly cups\r\nor goblets. They were found in a sandy and desert tract of country, the\r\none apparently which separates Khorasan from Balkh and Khawaresmia\r\nduring the prevalence of the Etesian gales which, unsettling and\r\nshifting the sand, kept constantly laid open fresh spots which were, in\r\nmany cases, strewed with gems. The search for these emeralds, a hardy\r\nand laborious undertaking, was performed by horsemen who, by fleet\r\nriding, could scour the wilderness in a brief space of time, bending\r\ntheir keen glances hither and thither as they moved along.[2613]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2601:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. iii. 99.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2602:\r\n\r\n  Id. iv. 48.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2603:\r\n\r\n  Id. i. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2604:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 61.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2605:\r\n\r\n  Id. ii. 82.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2606:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. i. 14.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2607:\r\n\r\n  Plin.

Now, in wheat, I believe, so prodigious\r\nan increase is all but impossible, whereas a still greater return might\r\nbe obtained from the Indian corn. A lady whom I knew at Thebes counted\r\neighteen hundred grains in one ear of Syrian maize which was, probably,\r\nnot less than nine inches in circumference; and from such grain the\r\nreturn mentioned by Herodotus[2615] is not at all extraordinary.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2614:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

Barn-door fowls were introduced\r\ninto Greece from Persia, and always continued to be known by the name of\r\nthe Median birds.[2616] Peaches, too, and various other kinds of fruit,\r\nas we have already mentioned in the book on Country Life, were brought\r\nto Greece from the Persian empire.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2616:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 69.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis country likewise exported the oil of white violets used in the\r\nbath, and the odour of which they enjoyed during their repasts;[2617]\r\nshaggy winter cloaks seem to have been obtained from northern Persia,\r\ntogether with dyed leather,[2618] resembling the shagreen and marocco of\r\npresent times, brought partly from Babylonia, partly from Persia Proper,\r\nwhich likewise supplied the world with carpets exquisitely variegated\r\nwith figures of animals.[2619]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2617:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor.

We still find that, for richness\r\n  of colouring and softness of texture, the carpets of Persia are quite\r\n  unrivalled. Fowler, Three Years in Persia, i. 81. Gibbon, in his rich\r\n  and picturesque style, has given a description of one of these carpets\r\n  found by the Arabs in the dwelling of the Persian monarch: “One of the\r\n  apartments of the palace was decorated with a carpet of of silk, sixty\r\n  cubits in length, and as many in breadth; a paradise or garden was\r\n  depicted on the ground; the flowers, fruits and shrubs were imitated\r\n  by the figures of the gold embroidery and the colours of the precious\r\n  stones, and the ample square was enriched by a variegated and verdant\r\n  border.” Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. ix. p. 370.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Persians also imported furs, but do not appear to have exported\r\nthem, the use of these articles being little known to the Greeks.[2620]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2620:\r\n\r\n  Beckmann, History of Inventions, iv. 204, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRespecting the commerce carried on with India the notions of the\r\nancients were confused, chiefly because the various commodities passing\r\nthrough other countries were often confounded with their indigenous\r\nproductions. We know, however, that from this rich land came many of the\r\nspices and precious stones in use among the Greeks,—as the diamond, the\r\nruby, the sapphire,[2621] and the finest kind of pearls,[2622] the most\r\nfragrant spikenard,[2623] with costus,[2624] and amomum,[2625] and\r\ncinnamon,[2626] and cassia,[2627] and odoriferous reeds.[2628] Thence\r\nalso was obtained a kind of cyperos,[2629] whose juice was bitter, and\r\nof yellow colour, and appears to have been used for removing hair from\r\nthe skin.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2621:\r\n\r\n  Carletti, Viaggi, t. ii. p. 231.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2622:\r\n\r\n  Ælian.

The\r\nwhiteness of the Indian sugar, as well as that it was loafed may be\r\ninferred from a passage of Dioscorides, who compares it to salt, and\r\nsays, that it broke easily beneath the tooth.[2633]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2630:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. i. 22.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2631:\r\n\r\n  Bontius, In Ind.

The\r\nmalabathron,[2635] another export of the Indian peninsula, was from the\r\nsimilarity of its odour by some of the ancients confounded with the leaf\r\nof the spikenard, as it appears to have been by the moderns with the\r\npiper betel, or the Canella Silvestris Malabarica. But from the\r\ndescription of Dioscorides, it is clearly neither the one nor the other;\r\nfor, while the betel is a parasite cultivated on terra firma, like the\r\nvine and the Canella Silvestris, the malabathron was, we are told, an\r\naquatic plant, floating on the surface of lakes, or the waters of\r\nmorasses, without the slightest connexion with the soil beneath, like\r\nthe little lentil of the marshes: its leaves when gathered were strung\r\non a linen thread, and in that manner hung up to dry, after which they\r\nwere laid by for exportation. Occasionally, during the heats of summer,\r\nthe malabathron lakes were dried up, upon which the natives were\r\naccustomed to scatter heaps of brushwood over their whole site and set\r\nthem on fire, so that the entire surface of the earth might be burned,\r\nwithout which, it was supposed the plant would no more appear. Among the\r\nuses of the malabathron was the sweetening of the breath, which was done\r\nby placing a leaf under the tongue. Thrown into coffers or wardrobes it\r\ncommunicated a perfume to raiment, and preserved it from the moth. The\r\nuses to which the wood of aloes was put were in some respects similar,\r\nas it was kept in the mouth to sweeten the breath, and sprinkled, when\r\nreduced to powder, over the body to repress perspiration.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2634:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

The artichoke[2639] was\r\nplentifully produced on the banks of the Indus, as well as in the\r\nmountains of Hyrcania and Khawaresmia. The substance denominated onyx\r\nshell,[2640] procured from a fish resembling the myrex, was found in\r\ncertain Indian marshes, where a species of spikenard is said to have\r\nflourished. On the drying up of the waters in the great heats of summer,\r\nthese shells were found strewed over the soil, and exported for their\r\nodoriferous and medicinal qualities. The great lizard, called the land\r\ncrocodile,[2641] has likewise been enumerated among the productions of\r\nIndia. Other Indian commodities were fine muslins,[2642] ivory, and\r\ntortoise shell,[2643] from Taprobana,[2644] a rich species of\r\nmarble,[2645] steel of the finest quality,[2646] peacocks,[2647] and a\r\nlarge, beautiful breed of white oxen.[2648]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2636:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. i. 80.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2637:\r\n\r\n  Id. i. 132.

Having been scraped thence\r\nit was supposed to be dried and introduced into commerce. These accounts\r\nhave already, by other authors, been shown to be erroneous, but they\r\nprove at least that indigo was in common use among the ancients, though\r\nwe understand nothing of the means by which it was produced, or how it\r\nwas cultivated.[2650]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2649:\r\n\r\n  Dioscor. v. 107.

It was understood, however, to be created by the labour of an\r\ninsect with eight feet, called ser, about twice the size of the largest\r\nbeetle. In other respects it was compared with the spider which suspends\r\nits web from the boughs of trees. These insects they kept in houses, the\r\ntemperature of which was regulated according to the change of the\r\nseasons. The fine thread spun by the ser was found twisted about its\r\nlegs. They fed them during four years upon the leaves of common panic,\r\nbut on the fifth, because they knew they would live no longer, they gave\r\nthem green reeds to eat, which was the food in which the creature most\r\ndelighted. On this it fed so greedily, that it burst itself, upon which\r\nstore of fine thread was found in its bowels.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2653:\r\n\r\n  Pausan. vi. 26. 6, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe country whence this substance was obtained is said to have been a\r\nkind of delta, situated in a deep recess of the Indian ocean, and\r\ninhabited by a mixed race, half Indian and half Scythian.

The exact\r\ncourse pursued by the caravans in these remote times has not been\r\naccurately described to us; but as the nature of the country has always\r\nremained unchanged, it is to be presumed, that they pursued exactly the\r\nidentical tracks which they at present follow. Occasionally some few of\r\nthe commodities of Central Asia may have found their way into Greece by\r\nthe desert, north of the Caspian, but the more common route lay through\r\nKhawaresmia and Syria, whence they were distributed to the rest of the\r\nwestern world by the Phœnicians.\r\n\r\nThe produce of India was probably transported across the Indus at\r\nAttock,[2656] and from thence through one of the nine passes into\r\nPersia, by way of Candahar and Herat, after which the caravan fell into\r\nthe road leading to Susa,[2657] Ecbatana, or Persepolis, according as\r\nits destination was the northern or southern part of Mesopotamia.\r\nSometimes commerce followed the course of rivers, down the Indus for\r\nexample, thence along the coast of Persia, and up the Persian gulf and\r\nthe Euphrates or the Red Sea. On most of the roads mentioned there\r\nappear to have existed in those ages caravanserais, as at present, where\r\nmerchants and travellers were accommodated with lodging, water, and\r\nfuel, being expected to carry along with them whatever provisions they\r\nrequired.

From a great variety\r\nof causes, the dissolution of the body was regarded by the pagans of\r\nantiquity with less terror and apprehension than modern nations\r\nexperience. Their belief in the continuance of existence was not perhaps\r\nmore unshaken than that of pious men in Christian countries, but the\r\nlife to come was contemplated as more nearly resembling the present; and\r\nthey imagined that, by the performance of certain rites and ceremonies,\r\nand through the favour of the gods in various ways obtained, they might\r\neasily secure to themselves a blissful immortality, which, according to\r\ntheir creed, was denied to none but the incorrigibly flagitious. In\r\nearlier times, moreover, before the birth of the sceptical systems of\r\nphilosophy, no chilling doubts had been thrown on the doctrine of\r\nimmortality. Ignorant they might be of the Divine nature, of the\r\nrelations of man to his Creator, of the true duties, obligations, and\r\nrules of life; but they were so fully convinced of the existence of a\r\nrace of superior beings, that they might almost be said to feel its\r\ntruth as they did that of their own existence. These beings they\r\nbelieved to be everlastingly occupied with human, or rather with\r\nHellenic, concerns; for it seems evident that most of the gods were\r\nlooked upon more as the parents and guardians of the Grecian race than\r\nas remote and general watchers over the whole universe. To pass out of\r\nlife, therefore, was but to pass out of the domains of one god into\r\nthose of another; to exchange the protection of the celestial for that\r\nof the infernal Zeus. Everywhere and on all occasions Gods were supposed\r\nto attend their footsteps, but more especially at the moment of their\r\ndecease, when a cloud of heavenly messengers hovered around them, some\r\nto accomplish the separation between soul and body, others to lead and\r\nprotect the spirit in its descent to the subterranean world, and others\r\nagain to watch over its happiness while there, sharing along with it the\r\nsame dwelling-place, and bearing the same relation to it as a monarch\r\ndoes to his subjects.\r\n\r\nPossessed firmly by persuasions of this kind, it is little to be\r\nwondered at that the ancient Greek experienced less reluctance to enter\r\nupon the domains of the dead than is now too commonly felt.[2658] He\r\nhad, besides, another motive to cheer his departure. It was his firm\r\nexpectation to be welcomed on his entrance to the Elysian fields by his\r\nparents or friends or companions, by all, in short, whom he had loved in\r\nlife, and who had preceded him to that sacred and serene abode. Thinking\r\nand feeling thus, death seemed scarcely death, but a mere shifting of\r\nthe scene or change of locality. It was but falling asleep in one place\r\nto wake in another where their happiness could know no change; where God\r\nwould wipe away tears from all eyes, and where there should be no more\r\ntrouble or sorrow or suffering for ever.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2658:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Tim. t. vii. p. 121, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese, nevertheless, must be regarded as the habitual convictions of the\r\nmind, which, however they might influence the actions and resolutions of\r\nmen, could by no means stifle their feelings, or prevent that sorrow and\r\nregret which must always be experienced by persons about to be separated\r\nfrom those they love. Hence the death-bed of the Greeks presented not a\r\nscene of stoical indifference. All the tenderness and sympathy of which\r\nthe human heart is capable was usually awakened. The friends, and more\r\nespecially the women of the family, crowded about the couch to press the\r\ndying hand, and catch the last breath as it fluttered in broken murmurs\r\nfrom the lips.[2659] Most persons, when about to bid an eternal adieu to\r\nthe world, desired to lay some command on their sorrowing friends, not\r\nas an imperious task but as a labour of love, by performing which they\r\nmight be reminded of the departed. Such commands as these the Grecian\r\nwomen were most anxious to receive, that they might treasure them up in\r\ntheir souls, and by pondering on them incessantly, day and night, keep\r\nvividly alive in their memory the idea of those who had once been all in\r\nall to them. Nor when the spirit had departed did they forsake the\r\ncorpse, nor abandon it to the care of menials. With their own hands they\r\nclosed the beloved eyes,[2660] and tied up the mouth from which words of\r\nkindness or comfort were never more to sound. Putting a severe restraint\r\nupon their feelings, they straightened,[2661] laved, anointed, and laid\r\nout the corpse,[2662] covered it with costly garments,[2663] and placed\r\ncrowns of flowers upon its head: it was then borne to the vestibule of\r\nthe mansion and laid with the feet towards the door,[2664] to intimate\r\nthat it was about to proceed on its last journey, and take up its abode\r\nin the house prepared for all living. Vessels of lustral water[2665]\r\nwere then placed beside it; that, being accounted unclean, all those who\r\npassed in or out and might be supposed to be reached by the effluvia\r\nwhich exhaled from the dead, might sprinkle and purify themselves.\r\nBranches of laurel and acanthus, with locks of hair, were suspended over\r\nthe doorway, each being a symbol speaking to the imagination of that\r\nlively people. While thus exposed the corpse was watched day and night\r\nby its natural guardians, until the moment arrived for bearing it forth\r\nto the funeral pile or the grave. It was then laid in a coffin,\r\ngenerally of cedar or cypress-wood,[2666] which, being placed upon a\r\nbier,[2667] was borne away, the mourning friends and family attending.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2659:\r\n\r\n  Il. ω. 743.

The men\r\nnext of kin marched silently in the rear of the coffin to intimate that\r\nthey should shortly follow in the same track, and the women who kept\r\ntogether in a body,[2671] closed the procession, weeping and lamenting\r\nas they went. Stationed here and there in the crowd, were certain\r\nfuneral musicians playing airs solemn and sad, but with an intermixture\r\nof enthusiastic notes, upon Lydian or Phrygian flutes. Sometimes the\r\ncompany was mounted in chariots or upon horses, but when especial honour\r\nwas intended to the dead, everybody accompanied the hearse on foot. And\r\nsurely a group like this, moving along by night through the narrow\r\nwinding streets of Athens skirting the rocks of the Acropolis, flitting\r\nacross the agora, between its silent booths and stately plane-trees, and\r\nissuing forth through the city gates into the sepulchral suburbs of the\r\nCerameicos, where a forest of tombs stretched a considerable distance\r\nalong the said way, to deposit, as if by stealth, the dust of a human\r\nbeing in the bosom of the earth, must have exhibited a striking and a\r\nsolemn spectacle; more particularly if we suppose that, roused by the\r\nmournful music, thousands of neighbours and fellow-citizens hurried to\r\ntheir casements to behold their countryman carried to his long home.\r\nHaving reached the destined spot, the body, if to be interred, was laid\r\nin the grave with its face looking towards the west.[2672] The earth was\r\nthen thrown upon the coffin, and a monument, in most cases, speedily\r\nerected over it. If by special desire of the deceased, or for any other\r\nreason, cremation[2673] was preferred, they constructed a funeral pile\r\nof unctuous and odoriferous woods upon which oil and sweet unguents were\r\ncommonly poured.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2668:\r\n\r\n  Demosth. adv.

Before, however, the flames were quite\r\nextinguished, custom required that a little wine should be cast upon\r\nthem, after which if any bones of the dead remained unconsumed they were\r\ncarefully collected together with the ashes, and deposited in an urn,\r\nwhich in Greece was usually committed to the earth.[2674] All the\r\nsurviving relations now returned mourning to their dwelling, where,\r\ntowards evening, a funeral feast was celebrated in honour of the\r\ndead.[2675] Twice during the same month were sacred rites performed at\r\nthe tomb, and afterwards for ever on the anniversary of the deceased’s\r\nbirth, as well as on a certain day of the festival of Anthesteria, when\r\nunfading flowers were strewed around, and heaps of crowns and garlands\r\nsuspended on the monument. The outward tokens of the grief felt inwardly\r\nconsisted of black garments,[2676] heads partially shorn and a sad and\r\nneglected countenance.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2674:\r\n\r\n  Numerous bassi-relievi representing these funeral banquets have been\r\n  preserved both at Athens and in the island of Chios, where the custom\r\n  has prevailed in modern times of fixing such pieces of antiquities in\r\n  the walls, over doors and gateways.

Declam. x.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn nearly all parts of the world, the moment death sets the impress of\r\nhis seal on the human clay it appears to acquire an awful and mysterious\r\nsanctity, which none but the hardened and base will consent to violate.\r\nBelonging to the grave, its everlasting calm and silence seem already to\r\nbrood over it. It presents itself to our eyes like the inhabitant of\r\nanother world, and therefore though voiceless it reveals to us, as it\r\nwere, some particulars respecting a state of being of which we know\r\nnothing, but feel necessarily the most devouring curiosity. Besides,\r\nwhen the deceased has been dear to us in life, we regard his corpse as\r\nthe deserted mansion of a friend, as the tabernacle of a soul scarcely\r\ndifferent, though divided from our own. On this account the ancient\r\nGreeks, a people beyond most others pious, imaginative, and\r\naffectionate, cultivated with peculiar care the duties which we owe the\r\ndead. Ancient writers abound with illustrations of this truth. When the\r\nThebans, after the defeat of Adrastos and Polyneices refused burial to\r\nthe fallen Argives, it was considered by the Athenians a sufficient\r\ncause for declaring war against Bœotia. It was not pretended that the\r\ninvaders had been engaged in an honourable war; but having expiated\r\ntheir transgression by death, their remains had passed under the\r\nprotection of the infernal deities, and to refuse them the rites of\r\nsepulture was not so much to insult them as Pluto, and the other gods of\r\nHades, whose subjects they were now become. The unburied corpse was,\r\nmoreover, a polluting object which defiled the temples of the celestial\r\ndivinities, and therefore they also were interested in watching over the\r\nrights of the dead; for dogs and beasts of prey might carry their flesh\r\nor bones into the fanes, and thus render them unclean. And this\r\nsentiment, which constituted one of the most amiable parts of the Greek\r\ncharacter, tended likewise to confer imperishable beauty and interest on\r\nthe Hellenic land. For, the numerous tombs, public and private,[2677]\r\nwhich clustered over and hallowed its surface, addressed themselves\r\nstill more powerfully to the heart than to the eye. Everywhere the\r\ndevotion of the people clung around them. They were at once the\r\ncreations and the monuments of human love, of public gratitude, of holy\r\nreverence for intellect and virtue.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2677:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Demosth. adv. Call. § 4.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same observation, indeed, applies universally. The pyramid, the\r\nsolitary barrow, rising like a hillock on the plains of Asia, the\r\ncrowded cemetery, the vast suites of sepulchres excavated beneath the\r\nsurface of the earth, each and all of these must ever be regarded by men\r\nof sensibility and unsophisticated understanding as so many unequivocal\r\ntokens of the ineradicable goodness of human nature. Examples without\r\nnumber might be adduced in illustration. When a North American chief was\r\nurged to cede to the European invaders the hunting-ground of his tribe,\r\nhe stated his objection in these words: “How can we abandon the country\r\nin which all our ancestors lie interred? Shall we say to the bones of\r\nour forefathers, ‘Arise, and go along with us into a strange land’?” In\r\nmany countries a more absorbing interest attaches to the abodes of the\r\ndead than to the habitations of the living. Who, for example, can\r\ntraverse, without the most profound emotion, those suites of\r\nsubterraneous palaces at Thebes denominated the Tombs of the Kings? You\r\nseem, in these vast painted halls and dusky passages, to hold actual\r\nconverse with death. The grave unfolds its mysteries on all sides\r\naround. The imagination is kindled and takes a colour from the unearthly\r\ncreations presented to it, and you return with something like reluctance\r\nto the glare and turmoil and busy passions of the world. Among the\r\nGreeks, as we have observed, the dead were invested with a sanctity\r\nwhich all good men esteemed inviolable, and this persuasion acquired\r\nadditional force from the belief, that, though separated, the spirit and\r\nthe body were not yet wholly independent of each other. For, upon the\r\ntreatment experienced by its remains the state of the soul was in some\r\nmeasure regulated in the realms below. If these received the rites of\r\ninterment, the spirit was allowed freely to traverse that stream, dusky\r\nand inviolable, which surrounded the realm of Hades. If not, the ghost,\r\ncold and desolate, wandered along its hither shore during the space of a\r\nhundred years; after which, the laws of Orcus relented, and permitted it\r\nto taste of happiness amid the groves of Asphodel,[2678] and those\r\nblissful bowers where poets and sages devoted the circle of eternity to\r\nthe culture and pure delights of wisdom. From this persuasion, the\r\nghosts of persons denied the rites of sepulture[2679] are represented by\r\nthe poets hovering around their corses and presenting themselves in\r\nvisions to their surviving friends, requesting them to sever, by the\r\nperformance of their obsequies, the sad links which still bound them to\r\ntheir dwellings of clay. Thus Homer introduces Elpenor[2680] conjuring\r\nOdysseus to perform this last sad office for his remains. Often when, by\r\nshipwreck or murder, the body was cast on some solitary shore, or\r\nabandoned in the recesses of some forest or mountain, inhumation was\r\nsolely dependent on chance. But if fortune conducted any stranger to the\r\nspot, it was considered incumbent on him to discharge, in one way or\r\nanother, the ties of humanity to the dead. But, because he might not be\r\nable to dig a grave or consume the body on a funeral pile, it was\r\nreckoned sufficient to cast three handfuls of dust upon the corpse, of\r\nwhich one, at least, was to be sprinkled on the head. Thus we find, in\r\nHorace,[2681] the manes of the Pythagorean philosopher, Archytas,\r\nintreating the mariners, who had found his body on the beach, to honour\r\nit with this rite:\r\n\r\n           Quamquam festinas, non est mora longa, licebit\r\n           Injecto ter pulvere curras.\r\n\r\n           Though great thy haste, this will not much delay;\r\n           Cast thrice the dust, then hasten hence away.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2678:\r\n\r\n  Hesiod.

Cassand. 367.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere were, however, certain classes of men who, by their open or secret\r\nwickedness, were supposed to be placed beyond the expansive circle of\r\nhuman sympathy, on whom it would have been criminal to lavish sepulchral\r\nrites. These were, in the first place, individuals struck by lightning,\r\nwhom the gods were believed thus to have destroyed,[2683] from a\r\nknowledge of their guilt, though hidden from all other eyes. Corpses of\r\nthis kind were usually covered with earth where they lay without the\r\nslightest ceremony, unless they happened to have fallen in some public\r\ntemple, or agora, or highway, under which circumstances a hook was\r\nfastened to the body, by which it was dragged and cast into some pit. On\r\nother occasions the carcase was hedged round and so left. Men guilty of\r\nsuicide were likewise denied the honours of burial, but more especially\r\nthose of the funeral pile. Their carcases were simply thrown into a pit\r\nand covered over, to prevent their becoming a nuisance to the living.\r\nVillains who committed sacrilege, and traitors to their country were not\r\nsuffered to enjoy in death the protection of those divinities whom they\r\nhad outraged, or the refuge of a grave in a country which they had\r\nbasely betrayed to the enemy.[2684] Their dishonoured bones were cast\r\nbeyond the borders, nor was it permitted any citizen to celebrate for\r\nthem the rites of burial. Thus King Pausanias, who sought to enslave his\r\ncountry to the Persians, was treated by the Lacedæmonians, Aristocrates\r\nby the Arcadians, and Phocion by the people of Athens,[2685] though in\r\nthis last case, perhaps, through error and misapprehension. The last and\r\nworst class were tyrants[2686] equally objects of hatred to gods and\r\nmen, who usually when overcome by their subjects expiated their guilt by\r\nthe most unheard-of torments, while, in the nether world, the worst\r\npangs of Tartarus were reserved for them. To deposit in the bosom of the\r\nearth the carcases of malefactors so heinous would of itself have been\r\nesteemed a crime of a very deep dye. The remains were, therefore,\r\ntrodden under foot, subjected to every other species of indignity, and\r\nthen cast forth to be devoured by the dogs and vultures. Nay, if we may\r\ninterpret the expression of Plato literally, the punishment of men who\r\neven aimed at tyranny in a free state and failed in the attempt was\r\ntremendous: they were tortured and mutilated, had their eyes burned out,\r\nsuffered every imaginable insult and injury, and at last crucified, or\r\ncovered with pitch and burned alive: their wives and children suffered\r\nthe same punishment—the innocent being confounded with the guilty. To\r\nprotect their ashes from insults such as the above, the kings of Egypt\r\nwho erected the pyramids and were in character fierce and tyrannical,\r\nare supposed by Herodotus not to have entrusted their bones to the\r\nkeeping of those structures. A wild story is also related of Periander\r\nof Corinth,[2687] who, conscious of having ruled his countrymen with a\r\nrod of iron, dreaded the effects of their resentment on his corpse.\r\nEffectually to conceal the place of his interment he is said to have\r\ndirected two of his satellites to go forth at night on a certain road\r\nand kill and bury clandestinely the first man they should meet. Four\r\nothers were despatched to execute the same vengeance upon them, and\r\nanother crowd of assassins received orders to exterminate and bury these\r\nfour. Periander, then old and infirm, presented himself to the first\r\nmurderers, was slain and buried, and the place, from the sudden death of\r\nall who might have known it, thus remained undiscovered for ever.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2683:\r\n\r\n  Artemidor. ii. 8.

In some sense, indeed, they were\r\nactually deified. Rites and ceremonies and sacrifices were performed\r\nannually in their honour, and by their great and heroic spirits future\r\ngenerations swore as by the most ancient inhabitant of Olympos.\r\nSometimes, as on the plain of Marathon, the remains of the warriors were\r\ncollected together, and with holy rites enclosed in one common barrow,\r\ncalculated by its dimensions to be co-lasting with the world. On other\r\noccasions their remains were brought to the city and buried there. Thus,\r\nat the outbreak of the Peloponnesian war, the first citizens who fell\r\nreceived the distinguished honours of a public funeral. Their remains\r\nwere enclosed in coffins of cedar, and laid in open hearses, drawn by\r\nhorses carefully caparisoned, and covered with garlands, were conveyed\r\nto the Cerameicos, the whole population of the state attending. When\r\nthey had been there committed to the earth, Pericles, the greatest\r\nstatesman and orator of those times, ascended a bema, and, in words\r\nwhich must thrill through the hearts of all posterity, pronounced on\r\nthem an encomium to merit which most brave men would cheerfully have\r\nbartered life.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2688:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. ii. 34.

On some occasions the bodies of the dead were followed with great\r\n  pomp to the grave, accompanied by the sound of many instruments and\r\n  voices. Athen. xiii. 67. The bodies of the dead were at other times,\r\n  apparently in the field of battle, stretched out on beds of leaves or\r\n  rushes, and a festive banquet with drinking cups was placed before\r\n  them, and crowns upon their heads. § 2.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe modes of sepulture prevalent in different ages among the Hellenes\r\nwere various in like manner as the monuments erected in honour of the\r\ndead. Originally, when public security was weak, men buried their dead\r\nwithin the walls of their own dwellings, where alone, perhaps, they\r\ncould hope to preserve their resting-place inviolable. In accordance\r\nwith this pious feeling a law was anciently enacted at Thebes in Bœotia,\r\nthat whoever built himself a house should construct within or adjoining\r\nit a repository for the dead. But when states grew up and acquired\r\nstrength, and the shadow of their protection fell around far and wide,\r\nit was found practicable to consult the public health without\r\ninfringement of the reverence due to the divinities of Hades, and the\r\nhabitations of the departed were erected, like a sacred circle, round\r\nthe city walls.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in the period of Grecian decrepitude, the cities once more\r\nopened their gates to their ancestors, and permitted that they should\r\nshare with themselves the imperfect security which was the lot of all in\r\nthose degenerate times.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said on the custom which obtained among both Greeks and\r\nRomans, of extending their cemeteries along the high roads leading\r\ncountrywards from the city gates.[2689] Their object appears to have\r\nbeen twofold: first, by erecting the monuments of deceased friends in\r\nsight of all persons entering or quitting the city to render their\r\nmemory more enduring; secondly, that by witnessing the honours paid to\r\nthe brave and good of past times, those who came after them might be\r\nincited to imitate their example.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2689:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Xenoph. Hellen. iii. 2. 14.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut no place was deemed too sacred to admit the remains of good or great\r\nmen, which were occasionally enshrined within the precincts of temples\r\nor sacred groves.[2690] Thus the children of Medea were buried in the\r\ntemple of Hera, Œdipos found a tomb in the grove of the Eumenides at\r\nColonos,[2691] and Hesiod, whose body comes floating to the shore while\r\nthe Samians are engaged in the performance of sacred rites, is honoured\r\nwith a funeral in the grove of the Nemean Zeus.[2692] Euchides,\r\nlikewise, who died in consequence of the extraordinary celerity with\r\nwhich he performed the journey to and from Delphi in quest of the sacred\r\nfire, was interred by the Platæans in the temple of Artemis Euclea.\r\nAmong the Spartans the practice commonly prevailed of burying around\r\nsacred edifices; nor did they, even in later times, banish their dead to\r\nthe suburbs; the design of this departure from the fashion elsewhere\r\nestablished being to eradicate from the mind of youth all apprehensions\r\nof spectres, and reluctance to move, whether by night or by day, among\r\ntombs and graves. In all parts of Greece, families, at least when above\r\nthe humblest in rank, possessed each their burial grounds, whether\r\nstanding wholly apart in orchards or gardens,[2693] or forming so many\r\nseparate portions of the general cemetery.[2694] But nowhere does so\r\ngreat stress appear to have been laid on this distinction of families in\r\ndeath as at Sparta, as may be inferred from the account of that battle\r\nin which, animated by the songs of Tyrtæos, the youth bound about their\r\nright arms tablets inscribed with their own names and those of their\r\nfathers, that so, should they all perish, their friends might be able to\r\nselect from among the heaps of slaughter the bodies of their relatives,\r\nand inter them with scarlet mantles and olive-leaves in the cemeteries\r\nof their clans.[2695]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2690:\r\n\r\n  Eurip.

Lycurg. § 27.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrequently the remains of distinguished persons were consigned to the\r\ndust in picturesque situations, remote from towns and the habitations of\r\nmen, where chapels were in many instances erected to their memory. Thus\r\nwe find the heroon of Androcrates[2696] shrouded in thick copses and\r\ntrees amid the spurs of Mount Cithæron, on the western extremity of the\r\nfield of battle of Platæa. In a situation very similar stood the tomb\r\nand temple of Amphiaraos, and the heroon of Drimacos in the island of\r\nChios. Among the Cretans, likewise, the sepulchre of Zeus occupied the\r\nlofty summit of a mountain, where its ruins are still pointed out to the\r\ntraveller. A poetical sentiment, moreover, has, in modern times, given\r\nrise to the persuasion that the ruins of Themistocles’ tomb are still to\r\nbe seen amid that line of ancient sepulchres which run along the\r\nsurf-beaten rocks near the point of Cape Halimos. On this supposition is\r\nbased the well-known passage of Byron:\r\n\r\n               “No breath of air to break the wave\r\n               That rolls below the Athenian’s grave;\r\n               That tomb which, gleaming o’er the cliff,\r\n               Just greets the homeward-veering skiff,\r\n               High o’er the land he saved in vain:—\r\n               When shall such hero live again?”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2696:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Aristid. § 11.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut the learning of Colonel Leake has clearly shown, that the monument\r\nof this illustrious statesman stood within the horns of the great port\r\nof Aphrodisium. In the city of Magnesia, where he died, his tomb stood\r\nin the agora, which was customary when extraordinary honour was designed\r\nthe dead.[2697] Thus the monument of Timoleon,[2698] surrounded by\r\nporticoes and other public buildings, was erected in the agora of\r\nSyracuse; and that of Harmodios and Aristogeiton occupied the same place\r\nin the city of Athens, where, in more ancient times, the tombs of\r\ndistinguished personages were hewn out in the face of the cliffs, lined\r\nwith marble, and otherwise sumptuously adorned. Solon, however, sought\r\nto repress the luxury of cemeteries[2699] by ordaining that no tomb\r\nshould have an arched roof, or require more labour than could be\r\nperformed by ten men in three days. But this law, in all probability,\r\nwas never strictly observed; for the Cimonian sepulchres, still seen\r\nhigh amid the rocks overlooking the hollow valley which divides the\r\nAreopagos from the Pnyx, seem to have been of dimensions too spacious to\r\nhave been hewn out within the legal term.[2700] Afterwards, moreover,\r\nmortuary monuments of extraordinary magnificence were erected at Athens,\r\nas that, for example, of the hetaira Pythonicè. But it was in barbarous\r\ncountries that funereal structures exhibited the greatest splendour,\r\nwhich reached possibly its acmè in the tomb of Mausolos, king of Caria,\r\nan edifice consisting of a pyramid erected on a square basis, adorned on\r\nall sides with sculptured figures in relief, and surmounted by a chariot\r\ndrawn by four horses. The tomb of the mistress of Gyges, though for\r\nmaterials inferior, probably exceeded in dimensions this seventh wonder\r\nof the world. It was erected, too, as a memorial of affection; for, when\r\nthe woman who, during her life, had ruled both him and his kingdom, had\r\nbeen removed from earth, that shepherd king collected together, we are\r\ntold, the whole of his subjects, and threw up so vast a barrow over her\r\nremains, that, in whatever part of his realm he might be, within Mount\r\nTmolos, he might enjoy the melancholy pleasure of beholding her grave.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2697:\r\n\r\n  Chandler, vol. i. p. 143.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2698:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Timol. § 39.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2699:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Cicero, de Leg. ii. 64.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2700:\r\n\r\n  Chandler, vol. ii. p. 99.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the structure of their tombs, as well as their mode of interment, the\r\nvarious nations of antiquity observed each a different style. Thus, in\r\nthe purification of Delos, the monuments of the Carians were easily\r\ndistinguished from those of the Greeks by the manner in which their\r\nremains were deposited in the grave. Certain sepulchral mounds, found in\r\nPeloponnesos, were distinguished by some characteristic features from\r\nthose of the natives, and denominated the Tombs of the Phrygians; and\r\nthe burying places of certain foreigners on whom the Greeks bestowed the\r\nname of Amazons, exhibited as long as they endured some distinctive\r\nmarks[2701] by which they were known to cover the ashes of some\r\nbarbarous people. Over the tomb of Hippolyta, indeed, a pillar was\r\nerected in the Grecian manner; but at Chalcis, where there was an\r\nAmazonium, the structure would appear to have exhibited some peculiar\r\nfeatures, as well as the tomb of these warlike ladies, which was shown\r\nin the Megaris, between the agora and a spot named Rhus, in the form of\r\na lozenge,[2702] resembling their shields. Similar in shape, likewise,\r\nwere probably the Amazonian monuments found near Scotussa in Thessaly,\r\nas well as those on the banks of the rivulet Hermodon, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cheronæa.[2703] On the plains of Troy the Amazon\r\nMyrinna reposed under a vast barrow.[2704]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2701:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Thes. § 27. Paus. i. 41. 7. Petit, de Amazon, p. 185.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2702:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Il. β. 814.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe structures thus erected in honour of the dead might have proved more\r\ndurable but for the practice common among the ancients, of interring\r\njewels, gold, precious vases,[2705] and other treasures with the corpse,\r\nwhich afterwards roused the cupidity of profligate men, and tempted them\r\nto rifle the last houses of their forefathers; for it is one of the most\r\nodious and debasing features of civilisation, at certain stages of it,\r\nthat death is habitually desecrated, and the grave ceases to be a\r\nrefuge. Thus the tombs of the Macedonian kings were plundered by the\r\nGauls[2706] in the alliance of Pyrrhos. Again, the colony of Roman\r\nfreedmen sent to raise Corinth from its ashes, discovering by chance\r\nthat the catacombs contained bronze and fictile vases of great beauty,\r\nrifled the whole cemetery, and filled Rome with the spoils, which were\r\ndenominated Necrocorinthia. Even the obolos[2707] placed beneath the\r\ntongue, and the simple ornaments of the humbler dead, proved sufficient\r\nto excite the avarice of a certain class of robbers, denominated from\r\ntheir practices tomb-spoilers.[2708] When, however, the dust of the\r\ndeparted has reposed in its cerements for many ages, to disturb and\r\nplunder it becomes the pursuit of learned men, and is regarded as a\r\nbranch of the science of antiquities. Thus the sepulchres of the\r\nEgyptian kings have been spoiled and polluted by travellers, who have\r\nburned by thousands the wooden gods of the Pharaohs in their kitchens,\r\nsawed off the faces of pillars, dragged forth bodies and coffins from\r\ntheir last hiding-place in order to pilfer the golden ornaments\r\nsuspended around the necks of the dead. In Etruria, too, the same\r\nscientific havoc has been carried on, and the museums of Europe have\r\nbeen enriched by what was once a capital offence. Even in our own\r\ncountry, barrows have been habitually opened, and the bones of our\r\nancestors dislodged from their homes. Very curious relics of antiquity,\r\nhowever, have thus been brought to light. Similar tumuli in the East,\r\ndenominated topes, have been examined in Affghanistân. Beneath the\r\ncentre is usually a well, in which the ancient remains, consisting of\r\nmetallic vases, small cylinders of gold, rings, jewels, and gold pins,\r\nappear to be found.[2709]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2705:\r\n\r\n  Hence the idea of the vast riches of Charon subsisting in the legends\r\n  of the East.

Hither, too, were brought\r\nbaskets full of all fair and fragrant flowers, more particularly roses,\r\nmyrtles, amaranths,[2711] and lilies, to be strewed upon the beloved\r\nspot. Sometimes graves were covered by a netting of wild thyme,[2712]\r\nwhich, like those characters that are ennobled by affliction, yielded\r\nforth a delicious perfume beneath the foot of the mourner. In cool and\r\nshady spots, graves were sometimes adorned with the small\r\neverlasting,[2713] and the white flower called pothos.[2714] Public\r\ncemeteries were likewise, in many places, beautified by trees, selected\r\nin some cases for their thick foliage and spreading form, as the elm; in\r\nothers, for their graceful shape and evergreen leaf, as the poplar and\r\nthe cypress. Other trees, also, whether planted by the hand of man or\r\nspringing up spontaneously, covered the walks or spots of green sward\r\nfound in the cemeteries of Greece, supplying in abundance that sombre\r\nshade into which grief loves to retire, and where the sepulchral plants\r\nchiefly delight to grow.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2710:\r\n\r\n  Varro, Ling, Lat. l. vi. ap.

Plant. vi. 8. 3.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSuch spots so shaded, so verdant, and full of fragrance, so consecrated\r\nto silence and repose, probably first suggested the idea of the Elysian\r\nFields or Islands of the Blessed, which the poets of Greece assigned to\r\nbe the abode of happy souls. At first perhaps the ghosts were believed\r\nto dwell in the cemeteries, retiring by day to the depths of the tombs\r\nand issuing forth during the dark and tranquil hours of night to enjoy,\r\nby the light of the moon or the stars, the sight of the world they had\r\npartially quitted. From this notion flowed all the modifications\r\nobservable in the internal structure of tombs. First, care was taken\r\nthat the earth should not press heavily on the corpse, somewhere within\r\nthe dimensions of which the ghost was supposed[2715] habitually to\r\nreside. Sentiments not greatly dissimilar still survive among ourselves.\r\nI once remember to have read on the gravestone of a little girl standing\r\nnear the stile by which you enter the shady churchyard of Newport, in\r\nMonmouthshire, the following epitaph, in which this idea is clearly\r\nembodied:\r\n\r\n                    Here a pretty baby lies,\r\n                    Sung asleep with lullabies;\r\n                    Pray be silent, and not stir\r\n                    The easy earth that covers her.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2715:\r\n\r\n  Among the Mohammedans of Persia like notions are found to exist. “I\r\n  often saw groups of people uttering the most doleful lamentations and\r\n  bedewing with their tears the dry sod which they surrounded. They\r\n  imagine the dead to be capable of _hearing_ but not of answering their\r\n  plaints.” Fowler, Three Years in Persia, i. p. 31.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSecondly spacious and elegant chambers were frequently constructed for\r\nthe spirit’s use, where food was likewise placed, and lamps were kindled\r\nwhich, furnished with wicks of amianthos[2716] and supplied with\r\ninexhaustible fountains of oil, were believed to burn on everlastingly.\r\nA similar notion leads many Mohammedan nations to turn a small arch in\r\nthe stone basement of their tombs to accommodate the ghost with free\r\ningress and egress. Connected also with this article in the creed of the\r\nancients[2717] was the opinion, that spirits might often be seen gliding\r\nin shadowy shapes among the tombs, which may be regarded as a notion\r\nalmost co-extensive with humanity itself.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2716:\r\n\r\n  Kirchman. de Funer. Rom. l. iv. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2717:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Hesiod. Opp. et Dies, 122, sqq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn their modes of sepulture the barbarous nations[2718] of the ancient\r\nworld differed widely from each other and from the Greeks. The Syrians,\r\nEgyptians, and even Persians, wholly eschewing the funeral pile, buried\r\ntheir dead, having first embalmed them with various conservative and\r\naromatic substances, as myrrh and aloes, and cedar-gum,[2719] and honey,\r\nand salt, and wax, and asphaltus, and resin, mingled with perfumes and\r\nprecious unguents. Among the Pythagoreans, who adopted foreign rites in\r\npreference to those of their country, it was customary to wrap the dead\r\nin leaves of myrtle, poplar, and aloes, and thus to commit them to the\r\nearth. The Albani put money into the coffins with the corpse; the\r\nTaxilli, the Brahmins, and the Thracians, like the modern Parsees,\r\nexposed the bodies of their relations to be devoured by vultures; the\r\nBarchæi, a people inhabiting the borders of the Black Sea, followed the\r\ncustoms of these nations in the case of such of their countrymen as fell\r\nin war; but when they happened to be so effeminate as to die peaceably\r\nin their beds, they were condemned to the flames. Dogs and carnivorous\r\nbirds constituted the sepulchres of the Parthians, Magians, Hyrcanians,\r\nand other savage nations, who, however, were careful to inter the bones\r\nwhich were left undevoured. Among these philosophical people no thought\r\nwas more habitual than that of death, since men walked daily beside\r\ntheir graves; for persons of condition, who could afford to be luxurious\r\nin matters of this kind, fed and pampered huge dogs for the express\r\npurpose of being devoured by them after death, such mode of interment\r\nbeing among them esteemed the most honourable. The Essedones, the\r\nCalantii, the Massagetæ, the Derbices, and the Hybernians, on this point\r\nvery strongly resembled in taste and habits the Battas of Sumatra, the\r\ncustom among them having been to honour their parents and friends with a\r\nfar superior sepulchre to that of the foregoing people, since they ate\r\nthem themselves. It is remarked, however, in the case of the Essedones,\r\nthat the skulls were carefully cleansed, gilded, and laid by, to be\r\nproduced on their solemn annual festivals. The Derbices somewhat\r\nimproved upon the method of their neighbours; for, when their old people\r\nwere found to live too long, they hastened the approach of death in the\r\ncase of the men, by slaughtering them like victims, and in that of the\r\nold women, by strangling them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2718:\r\n\r\n  Alex. ab Alex. iii. 2. p. 114. a. sqq.

The Caspians adopted a different method of bringing\r\ndown the population to a level with the means of subsistence; for, when\r\ntheir parents and friends exceeded the age of seventy, they either\r\nexposed them in remote and desolate places, as infants in many countries\r\nwere, or shut them up in huts to perish of hunger and thirst. The mode\r\nof disposing of the dead adopted by one of the Scythian nations was, to\r\nbind their corpses to the trunks of trees, where they remained a long\r\ntime, congealed in the midst of ice and snow: to have interred them in\r\nthe earth they would have regarded as a crime. Not greatly dissimilar\r\nwas the Phrygian mode, according to which the dead were placed upright\r\non ranges of stones fifteen feet high. A large cemetery of this kind,\r\nhaving many ranges of rude columns, each with its corpse or skeleton,\r\nviewed by the dubious light of the moon, with flights of ravens or\r\nvultures preying upon the bodies recently set up, must have presented a\r\nterrific spectacle. The Nasamones, a people of northern Africa, buried\r\ntheir dead in a sitting posture, which, as I am informed by General\r\nMiller, is still the custom among the Araucanian Indians, who, binding\r\nthe corpse in the necessary posture with cords, excavate for it a grave\r\nbeneath their own beds. In some parts of the world, as in Thrace, for\r\nexample, and India, persons greatly advanced in years, more especially\r\nsuch as were distinguished for the cultivation of wisdom frequently\r\nascended voluntarily the funeral pile, like the Yoghee Calanos, and\r\nPerigrinos who affected the airs of a philosopher, terminated their\r\nexistence with composure, or even an appearance of gaiety in the flames.\r\nA certain tribe said to have inhabited the coast of the Red Sea, beyond\r\nthe Æthiopians and the Arabs, interred their friends in the sand, within\r\nhigh-water mark, so that their graves should constantly be overflowed by\r\nthe surge. The Æthiopians either cast the bodies of the deceased into\r\nthe Nile, or enclosed them in glass coffins, through which the\r\nmouldering form might ever be contemplated. In some parts of Upper Nubia\r\na similar practice still prevails; for the corpse being laid on the\r\nsand, a wall of loose rocks is built up around it, and secured with a\r\nslab atop. Through numerous apertures in the sides, of dimensions to\r\nadmit light but exclude the jackals, the skeleton may easily be seen.\r\n\r\nAccording to a tradition preserved by Ælian,[2720] Belos was interred in\r\na glass coffin, which, when Xerxes caused his tomb to be opened, was\r\nfound nearly filled with oil, wherein the body lay floating. Beside it\r\nstood a small column, on which was this inscription, “Woe to him who\r\nhaving broken into this sepulchre shall fail to fill my coffin.” At this\r\nXerxes was troubled, and immediately gave orders that oil should be\r\npoured into the sarcophagus, but to no purpose; for, though they made\r\nthe attempt once and again, it rose no nearer to the brim than before.\r\nConceiving that some grievous calamity was impending over him, the king\r\nat length desisted, and quitted the monument in the deepest dejection.\r\nHe shortly afterwards, adds the historian, undertook his unhappy\r\nexpedition into Greece, at the conclusion of which, flying back to his\r\nown country, he was there assassinated, as believed, by his own son.\r\n\r\nThe Pœonians cast their dead into marshy pools; the Ichthyophagi into\r\nthe sea. Very different was the custom of the Troglodytæ, who, tying\r\ntheir corpses neck and heels with the twigs of some flexible shrub, in\r\nthis manner carried them forth, and raising over them heaps of stones,\r\nas the Phoceans did over Laïos and his servants, fixed, with laughter\r\nand merriment, the horns of goats upon the tumulus. Similar tombs exist\r\nat this day in Affghanistân, in which are stuck sticks bearing wreaths\r\nand shreds of cloth, together with tusks of the moufflon, the ibex, and\r\nmarkhur.[2721] In China, at the annual festival in honour of the dead,\r\nthe sepulchres are decorated with streamers of red and white paper. Dead\r\nbodies, in the Balearic isles, were jointed, cut up, and stowed in urns\r\non which huge piles of rock were thrown. The Panebi, a people of Libya,\r\nhad a custom resembling in part that of the Essedones: on burying the\r\nbodies of their kings they gilded their skulls, and suspended them in\r\ntheir temples as ornaments. The Sindi, a people of Scythia, doubtless a\r\nbranch of the Ichthyophagi, used to bury in the graves of their warriors\r\na small fish for every enemy he had slain in battle, which must,\r\ndoubtless, if they were a brave people, have rendered their cemeteries\r\nanything but odoriferous.[2722]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2720:\r\n\r\n  Var.

At one time, however,\r\na practice, little inferior in atrocity to those above described, is\r\nsaid to have prevailed in the island of Ceos,[2723] where men on\r\nreaching sixty years of age were constrained to drink hemlock or opium,\r\nin order to economise the means of subsistence. But this law, if it ever\r\nexisted, must be thrown back to very remote times, it being wholly\r\ninconsistent with even the smallest advances of civilisation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2723:\r\n\r\n  Strab. x. 5. t. ii. p. 387. Val. Max. ii. 6. 8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies and symbols by which among the Hellenes sorrow was\r\nexpressed for the loss of friends were numerous and significant. In the\r\nfirst place, all tokens of pleasure and enjoyment were suppressed, that\r\naffliction might seem to have extinguished every spark that might\r\nthereafter have kindled joy. From wine and sumptuous viands and whatever\r\nelse brings gratification to the mind at ease, they abstained as though\r\nwholly unworthy to be honoured with even the semblance of a capacity to\r\nmitigate their sorrow for the departed. They banished all instruments of\r\nmusic which happened to be in the house, to intimate that they\r\nthenceforward renounced the delights derivable from sweet sounds.[2724]\r\nThe same practice precisely prevailed among the Arabs under the Kalifat.\r\nThus “Haroon-er-Raschid, wept, we are told, over Shemselnihar, and,\r\nbefore he left the room, ordered all the musical instruments to be\r\nbroken.” They excluded the light from their chambers, and retired to sob\r\nand lament in gloomy recesses, as different as possible from the spots\r\nwhich in the company of the beloved and lost object they were accustomed\r\nto frequent. They neglected the care of their persons, suffered in some\r\nplaces the hair and beard to grow, or disfigured themselves by cutting\r\noff a portion of their locks, casting ashes on their heads, and wrapping\r\nthemselves in coarse and black apparel.[2725] In consequence we find,\r\nthat the very manes[2726] of their mules and horses were shorn.\r\nAlexander, during the paroxysm of his grief for the loss of\r\nHephæstion,[2727] even demolished the battlements of cities, and,\r\nexaggerating the cruelty and barbarism of remoter ages, crucified the\r\nphysician who had attended the youth, prohibited all music in his camp,\r\nand undertaking an expedition against certain tribes hitherto unsubdued,\r\noffered up whole hecatombs to the manes of his minion.[2728] The\r\nmourning of the Lacedæmonians on the death of their kings partook\r\nlargely of the spirit of barbarism. As soon as the event occurred,\r\nhorsemen were despatched to make it known throughout the Lacedæmonian\r\nterritories, while crowds of women paraded up and down the city, beating\r\nor sounding kettle-drums. From every family two persons, one of either\r\nsex, were then selected, who were compelled under grievous penalties to\r\nsmear and disfigure themselves.[2729] In fact, assembling in great\r\nnumbers, Spartans, Laconians, and Helots, together with their wives,\r\nthey beat their foreheads and uttered strange howlings, ever and anon\r\naffirming, amid their well-acted grief, that the last king was the best.\r\nWhen the prince happened to fall in battle, his effigy was borne home on\r\na bier sumptuously adorned, and to this the same honour was paid as to\r\nthe real corpse. During the ten days immediately succeeding the funeral\r\nno public business was transacted. For private individuals, the\r\nLacedæmonians scarcely mourned at all, their system of ethics requiring\r\nthem to suppress every more tender feeling of the heart.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2724:\r\n\r\n  Eurip.

It is well-known that\r\nthe Greeks regarded the spirits of good men of former ages as guardian\r\ngenii, to whom belonged religious veneration amounting perhaps to\r\nworship. Their gods, in truth, were in many cases colonists from earth,\r\nwhich can surprise no one who observes, that among them the principle of\r\nlife was deified, and this, derived from gods to mortals, resided for a\r\ntime on earth, and then, by continuing to move on in the circle,\r\nreturned to the heavens from which it sprang. They seem to have regarded\r\nthe earth as a sort of nursery-ground in which the seeds of divinity\r\nwere sown, to be afterwards transplanted and bloom elsewhere. But among\r\nthe offspring of earth none appeared to them so nearly akin to deity as\r\nthose in whom courage and energy shone preëminently, who loved\r\npassionately the soil from which they sprang, and who sought cheerfully\r\nin its breast a refuge from dishonour. Hence the apotheosis and\r\nadoration of the brave; hence the Platæan ceremonies, which, down even\r\nto Roman times, inspired the youth of Greece with admiration for their\r\nancestors, and called to their mind those glorious days when their\r\ncountry teemed with freemen ready at any moment to shed their blood for\r\nthe institutions and the land which those institutions alone rendered\r\nholy.[2730] These anniversary rites were celebrated on the sixteenth day\r\nof the month Maimacterion, the Alalcomenios of the Bœotians. The\r\nprocession moved forth from the city in the grey of the morning, having\r\nat its head a trumpeter sounding the signal of battle. Numerous chariots\r\nfollowed, filled with myrtle-branches, and wreaths, and garlands,\r\nsucceeded by a black bull. Vessels of wine, and jars of milk, and vases\r\nof oil and odoriferous essences were borne next by a number of free\r\nyouths, no slave being permitted to take part in these solemnities\r\nperformed in honour of men who had died for liberty. Last in the\r\nprocession came the archon, habited in a scarlet robe and armed with a\r\nsword, though on all other occasions he was forbidden the touch of\r\nsteel, and went clad in white. In his hand he bore a water-jar taken\r\nfrom the Hall of Archives. In this he drew water from a fountain, and\r\nhaving laved therewith the pillars which surmounted the tombs, he\r\nperfumed them with the essences: next slaying the bull at the altar, and\r\naddressing his prayers to Zeus and the Chthonian Hermes, he invoked to\r\npartake of the funeral repast and the streams of blood, the spirits of\r\nthose valiant men who had fallen for their country. Then, filling a\r\ngoblet with wine and pouring it forth in libations, he concluded with\r\nthese words: “I drink to the warriors who died for the liberties of\r\nGreece.”[2731]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2730:\r\n\r\n  See the description of a tomb of honour in Plat. de Legg. xii. t.\r\n  viii. p. 292, where Suidas seems to suppose the arch to have been\r\n  built of precious stones, v. ψαλίδα t. ii. p. 1165. c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2731:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

BENTLEY, WILSON, and FLEY,\r\n                        Bangor House, Shoe Lane.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                           Transcriber’s Note\r\n\r\nThe printer employed the cursive forms of beta (ϐ) and theta (ϑ),\r\nsometimes in the same passage with the standard β and θ. These have been\r\nreplaced with the standard forms.\r\n\r\nSome place names appear with slight spelling variations. In the interest\r\nof text searches, these have been modified to the most frequently used\r\nversion. Compound words sometimes appear with or without a hyphen, e.g.,\r\n‘corn-chandler’ / ‘cornchandler’. Where hyphenation occurs on a line\r\nbreak, the hyphen is retained only if there is a clear preference\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nPunctation errors and inconsistencies in the footnote and index\r\napparatus have been corrected with no further mention here.\r\n\r\nIndex entries refer to topics in all three volumes of this text. Notes\r\nwere numbered sequentially from ‘1’ on each page. In this medium, the\r\nfootnotes have been re-sequenced for uniqueness, and any references to\r\nfootnotes in the index employ those new numbers.\r\n\r\nIndex entries in Greek sometimes do not include diacritical marks. These\r\nhave been changed to match the referenced text, to facilitate text\r\nsearches.\r\n\r\n                                Comments\r\n\r\n   80.5.7     The third footnote on p. 80 (note 317) contains a\r\n              Greek quotation from Theophrastus’ Characters c. 1.:\r\n              “πρὸς τοὺς δανειζομένους καὶ ἐρανίζοντας, ὡς οὐ\r\n              =πωλείφήσεν=.” The passage as it appears in the\r\n              Perseus collection ends with “ὡς οὐ =πωλεῖ, καὶ= μὴ\r\n              πωλῶν.”\r\n\r\n   124.n8.9   The opening quotation mark was printed  several lines\r\n              down at ‘“élémens de la classe...’.\r\n\r\n   474.61     In the original entry regarding the lack of stress on\r\n              writing in Sparta, there was no volume reference, and\r\n              the page reference was to p. 180. It was found at iii.\r\n              280.\r\n\r\n   446.16     The entry ‘cattle stalls’ refers to the first note on\r\n              p. 291 of Vol ii. The note was found on p. 271.\r\n\r\n   466.42     The entry for ‘Rhododendron’ includes a reference to\r\n              ‘note 4’, without a volume or page reference. The only\r\n              other reference in these volumes is at iii. 344 _n._ 1\r\n              (note 1982 here).\r\n\r\n   466.13     The note referring to ‘Relics preserved in temples’ at\r\n              i. 34 _n._ 2 is found at p. 84 of Vol. i., now note\r\n              263.\r\n\r\nOther errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected,\r\nand are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the\r\noriginal. Corrections within notes are denote with ‘n’ and the original\r\nnote number.\r\n\r\n 32.n1.2    ὦ[᾿´]νδρες, ἀπολελῦσθαί                  Removed.\r\n 32.n5.10   ε[υ/ὐ]νοῦχός                             Replaced.\r\n 32.n5.14   σ[ό/ο]φισταί                             Replaced.\r\n 32.n5.20   Ἀλλ’ [ὦ ’/ὠ]γαθέ, ἔφην                   Replaced.\r\n 34.32      which, more[o]ver was prohibited         Inserted.\r\n 34.n5.1    παρα τοις Αθηναίο[ι]ς                    Inserted.\r\n 42.8       the express[s]ion of the historian       Removed.\r\n 45.36      those amon[g]st them                     Inserted.\r\n 56.18      at the same time, [“]a portion of land   Removed.\r\n 76.n5.12   [ὀι[/οἰ]νηστήρια                         Replaced.\r\n 76.n5.16   et publico annulo signatos fuisse.[”]    Added.\r\n 89.n5.8    Απολλαδωρος                              Απολλ=ό=δωρος?\r\n 102.n2.10  τῆς εἰς τὰ[ί] καλὰ ῥαθυμὶας              Removed.\r\n 103.n3.25  Tota abit hora.[”]                       Added.\r\n 111.n3.1   [α/ἀ]μπελιῶνας                           Replaced.\r\n 118.n1     observes Pallas, [“]is partly converted  Added.\r\n 124.n8.30  un salaire raison[n]able                 Inserted.\r\n 137.n22.5  χρῆσις δὲ α[ῦ/ὐ]των ἐστιν                Replaced.\r\n 151.20     most elabo[bo]rately wrought.
