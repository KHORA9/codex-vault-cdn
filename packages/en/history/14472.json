How the\r\nname of this our dwelling-place came about, nobody knows. Not less than\r\ntwelve dozen ways have been found to spell it; a score of different\r\nderivations \"discovered\" for it; and guesses innumerable given as to its\r\norigin, but we still wait for the information required.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in the Conqueror's Days.~--The Manor was held, in 1066, by\r\nAlwyne, son of Wigod the Dane, who married the sister of the Saxon\r\nLeofric, Earl of Mercia. According to \"Domesday Book,\" in 1086, it was\r\ntenanted by Richard, who, held, under William Fitz-Ansculf, and included\r\nfour hides of land and half-a-mile of wood, worth 20s.; there were 150\r\nacres in cultivation, with but nine residents, five villeins, and four\r\nbordarers. In 1181 there were 18 freeholders (_libere tenentes_) in\r\nBirmingham cultivating 667 acres, and 35 tenants _in demesne_, holding\r\n158 acres, the whole value being £13 8s. 2d.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in the Feudal Period.~--The number of armed men furnished by\r\nthis town for Edward III.'s wars were four, as compared with six from\r\nWarwick, and forty from Coventry.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in the Time of the Edwards and Harrys.~--The Manor passed\r\nfrom the Bermingham family in 1537, through the knavish trickery of Lord\r\nL'Isle, to whom it was granted in 1545. The fraud, however, was not of\r\nmuch service to the noble rascal, as he was beheaded for treason in\r\n1553. In 1555 the Manor was given by Queen Mary to Thomas Marrow, of\r\nBerkswell.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1538.~--Leland, who visited here about this date, says in\r\nhis \"Itinerary\"--\"There be many smithies in the towne that use to make\r\nknives and all manner of cutlery tooles, and many lorimers that make\r\nbittes, and a great many naylors, so that a great part of the towne is\r\nmaintained by smithes, who have their iron and seacole out of\r\nStaffordshire.\" He describes the town as consisting of one street, about\r\na quarter of a mile long, \"a pretty street or ever I enterd,\" and \"this\r\nstreet, as I remember, is called Dirtey.\"\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1586.~--Camden in his \"Britannica,\" published this year,\r\nspeaks of \"Bremicham, swarming with inhabitants, and echoing with the\r\nnoise of anvils, for the most part of them are smiths.\"\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1627.~--In a book issued at Oxford this year mention is\r\nmade of \"Bremincham inhabited with blacksmiths, and forging sundry kinds\r\nof iron utensils.\"\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1635.~--As showing the status the town held at this date\r\nwe find that it was assessed for \"ship money\" by Charles I. at £100, the\r\nsame as Warwick, while Sutton Coldfield had to find £80 and Coventry\r\n£266.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1656.~--Dugdale speaks of it as \"being a place very\r\neminent for most commodities made of iron.\"\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1680-90.~--Macaulay says: The population of Birmingham\r\nwas only 4,000, and at that day nobody had heard of Birmingham guns. He\r\nalso says there was not a single regular shop where a Bible or almanack\r\ncould be bought; on market days a bookseller named Michael Johnson\r\n(father of the great Samuel Johnson) came over from Lichfield and opened\r\na stall for a few hours, and this supply was equal to the demand. The\r\ngun trade, however, was introduced here very soon after, for there is\r\nstill in existence a warrant from the Office of Ordnance to \"pay to John\r\nSmart for Thomas Hadley and the rest of the Gunmakers of Birmingham, one\r\ndebenture of ffour-score and sixteen poundes and eighteen shillings,\r\ndated ye 14th of July, 1690.\"--Alexander Missen, visiting this town in\r\nhis travels, said that \"swords, heads of canes, snuff-boxes, and other\r\nfine works of steel,\" could be had, \"cheaper and better here than even\r\nin famed Milan.\"\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1691.~--The author of \"The New State of England,\"\r\npublished this year, says: \"Bromichan drives a good trade in iron and\r\nsteel wares, saddles and bridles, which find good vent at London,\r\nIreland, and other parts.\" By another writer, \"Bromicham\" is described\r\nas \"a large and well-built town, very populous, much resorted to, and\r\nparticularly noted a few years ago for the counterfeit groats made here,\r\nand dispersed all oven the kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1731.~--An old \"Road-book\" of this date, says that\r\n\"Birmingham, Bromicham, or Bremicham, is a large town, well built and\r\npopulous. The inhabitants, being mostly smiths, are very ingenious in\r\ntheir way, and vend vast quantities of all sorts of iron wares.\" The\r\nfirst map of the town (Westley's) was published in this year. It showed\r\nthe Manorhouse on an oval island, about 126 yards long by 70 yards\r\nextreme width, surrounded by a moat about twelve yards broad. Paradise\r\nStreet was then but a road through the fields; Easy Hill (now Easy Row),\r\nSummer Hill, Newhall Hill, Ludgate Hill, Constitution Hill, and Snow\r\nHill pleasant pastures.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1750.~--Bradford's plan of the town, published in 1751,\r\nshowed a walk by Rea side, where lovers could take a pleasant stroll\r\nfrom Heath Mill Lane. The country residences at Mount Pleasant (now Ann\r\nStreet) were surrounded with gardens, and it was a common practice to\r\ndry clothes on the hedges in Snow Hill. In \"England's Gazetteer,\"\r\npublished about this date, Birmingham or Bromichan is said to be \"a\r\nlarge, well-built, and populous town, noted for the most ingenious\r\nartificers in boxes, buckles, buttons, and other iron and steel wares;\r\nwherein such multitudes of people are employed that they are sent all\r\nover Europe; and here is a continual noise of hammers, anvils, and\r\nfiles.\"\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1765.~--Lord and Lady Shelburne visited here in 1765. Her\r\nladyship kept a diary, and in it she describes Mr. Baskerville's house\r\n(Easy Row) as \"a pretty place out of the town.\" She also mentions\r\nvisiting a Quaker's to see \"the making of guns.\"\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1766.~--In \"A New Tour through England,\" by George\r\nBeaumont, Esq., and Capt. Henry Disney, Birmingham is described as \"a\r\nvery large populous town, the upper part of which stands dry on the side\r\nof a hill, but the lower is watry, and inhabited by the meaner sort of\r\npeople. They are employed here in the Iron Works, in which they are such\r\ningenious artificers, that their performances in the smallwares of iron\r\nand steel are admired both at home and abroad. 'Tis much improved of\r\nlate years, both in public and private buildings.\"\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1781.~--Hutton published his \"History of Birmingham\" this\r\nyear. He estimated that there were then living ninety-four townsmen who\r\nwere each worth over £5,000; eighty worth over £10,000; seventeen worth\r\nover £20,000; eight worth over £30,000; seven worth over £50,000; and\r\nthree at least worth over £100,000 each.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in 1812.~--The appearance of the town then would be strange\r\nindeed to those who know but the Birmingham of to-day. Many\r\nhalf-timbered houses remained in the Bull Ring and cows grazed near\r\nwhere the Town Hall now stands, there being a farmhouse at the back of\r\nthe site of Christ Church, then being built. Recruiting parties paraded\r\nthe streets with fife and drum almost daily, and when the London mail\r\ncame in with news of some victory in Spain it was no uncommon thing for\r\nthe workmen to take the horses out and drag the coach up the Bull Ring\r\namid the cheers of the crowd. At night the streets were patrolled by\r\nwatchmen, with rattles and lanterns, who called the hours and the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n~AB House,~ so called from the initials inscribed thereon to show the\r\ndivision of the parishes of Aston and Birmingham near to Deritend\r\nBridge. Early in 1883 part of the foundations were uncovered, showing\r\nthat the old building was raised on wooden piles, when the neighbourhood\r\nwas little better than a swamp.\r\n\r\n~ABC Time Table~ was first issued in July, 1853. A rival, called the\r\n\"XYZ Time Table,\" on a system that was to make all the puzzles of\r\nBradshaw as plain as pikestaves, was brought out in August, 1877, but it\r\nrequired such extra wise heads to understand its simplicity that before\r\none could be found the whole thing was lost, the old Alpha being\r\npreferred to the new Omega.\r\n\r\n~Accidents and Accidental Deaths~ are of constant occurrence. Those here\r\nnoted are but a few which, from their peculiar nature, have been placed\r\non record for reference.\r\n\r\nA woman fell in Pudding Brook, June 3, 1794, and was drowned in the\r\npuddle.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, a Mr. Wright, a patten-maker, of Digbeth, attempted to cross\r\nthe old bridge over the Rea, fell in and was \"smothered in the mud.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bridge in Wheeley's Road was burst up by flood waters, November 26,\r\n1853.\r\n\r\nFive men were killed by the fall of a scaffold in New Street Station,\r\nOct. 11, 1862.\r\n\r\nA lady was accidently shot in Cheapside, Nov. 5, 1866.\r\n\r\nPratt, a marker at Bournebrook Rifle Range, was shot April 12, 1873.\r\n\r\nThe body of a man named Thomas Bishop who had fallen in a midden in\r\nOxford Street, was found Oct. 3, 1873.\r\n\r\nCharles Henry Porter, surgeon, Aug. 10, 1876, died from an overdose of\r\nprussic acid taken as a remedy.\r\n\r\nRichard Riley was killed by the bursting of a sodawater bottle, June 19,\r\n1877.\r\n\r\nAlfred Mills drowned in a vinegar vat at the Brewery in Glover Street,\r\nMarch 7, 1878.\r\n\r\nTwo gentlemen (Messrs.

In 1603\r\nit was enacted that not more than 1d. (equal to 9d. value now) should be\r\ncharged per quart for the best ale or beer, or for two quarts of the\r\n\"smaller\" sort. An additional excise duty was imposed on ale and beer in\r\n1643. See also _Breweries_.\r\n\r\n~Almanacks.~--The first English-printed Almanack was for the year 1497,\r\nand the London Stationers' Company had the monopoly of printing them for\r\nnearly 300 years. The first locally printed Almanack was the \"Diaria\r\nBritannica\" (or \"British Diary\"), by Messrs. Pearson and Rollason,\r\nissued in 1787 for 1788, at 9d. per copy, in addition to the 1s. 6d.\r\nrequired for stamp duty. It was barely half the size and not a tenth the\r\nvalue of the \"Diary\" published by Messrs Walter Showell and Sons, and of\r\nwhich 20,000 copies are given away annually. The stamp duty was removed\r\nfrom Almanacks in 1834. \"Showell's Almanack\" in past years was highly\r\nesteemed before we had been supplied with \"Moody's,\" the \"Red Book,\"\r\n&c., and a copy of it for the year 1839 is valuable as a curiosity, it\r\nbeing issued with a partly printed page with blanks left for the\r\ninsertion of the names of the members of the Corporation, whose first\r\nelection under the charter of incorporation was about to take place. To\r\nprevent any mistake, the \"Esqrs.\" were carefully printed in where the\r\nnames of the new Aldermen were to go, the blanks for Councillors being\r\nonly honoured with a \"Mr.\"\r\n\r\n~Almshouses~ for Lench's Trust were built in Steelhouse Lane in 1764. In\r\nlater years other sets of houses have been built in Conybere Street,\r\nHospital Street, Ravenhurst Street, and Ladywood Road, the inmates, all\r\nwomen, numbering 182. Jas. Dowell's Almshouses in Warner Street,\r\nconsisting of 20 houses and a chapel, known as the \"Retreat,\" were built\r\nin 1820. Mrs. Glover's Almshouses in Steelhouse Lane for 36 aged women,\r\nwere erected in 1832. James Lloyd's twenty-four Almshouses in Belgrave\r\nStreet were erected in 1869.\r\n\r\n~Aluminium.~--This valuable material for the use of one of our staple\r\ntrades was first obtained by a German chemist in 1837, but was not\r\nproduced in sufficient quantity for manufacturing purposes until 1854,\r\nat which time its market value was 60s. per oz. It gradually cheapened,\r\nuntil it is now priced at 5s., and a company has lately been formed for\r\nits more easy manufacture, who promise to supply it at about as many\r\npence.\r\n\r\n~Amphitheatres.~--Astley's celebrated amphitheatre was brought here in\r\nOctober, 1787. Mr. and Mrs. Astley themselves had performed in\r\nBirmingham as early as 1772.--A local amphitheatre was opened in Livery\r\nStreet in 1787, on the present site of Messrs. Billing's printing works.\r\nAfter the riots of 1791 it was used for a time by the congregations of\r\nOld and New Meeting, while their own chapels were being rebuilt. An\r\nattempt to bring it back to its old uses failed, and \"the properties\"\r\nwere sold Nov. 25, 1795. Several sects occupied it in after years, the\r\nlast being the Latter-Day Saints. It was taken down in 1848.--Another\r\namphitheatre was opened at Bingley Hall, December 29, 1853, by the\r\nplucky but unlucky John Tonks, a well-known caterer for the public's\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n~Amusement,~ Places of--Notes of the Theatres, Concert Halls, Parks,\r\n&c., will be found under the several headings. Among the most popular\r\nseries of concerts of late years have been those of a Saturday evening\r\n(at 3d. admission) in the Town Hall, which began on Nov. 8, 1879, and\r\nare continued to present date.\r\n\r\n~Analyst.~--Dr. Hill was appointed Borough Analyst in Feb., 1861, his\r\nduties being to examine and test any sample of food or drinks that may\r\nbe brought or sent to him in order to prove their purity or otherwise.\r\nThe fees are limited to a scale approved by the Town Council.\r\n\r\n~Ancient History~ of Birmingham can hardly be said to exist. Its rise\r\nand progress is essentially modern, and the few notes that have come to\r\nus respecting its early history will be found briefly summarised at the\r\ncommencement of this book.\r\n\r\n~Anti-Borough-Rate Meeting.~--In 1874 the Town Council asked for power\r\nto lay a Borough-rate exceeding 2s. in the £., but after three days'\r\npolling (ending March 30) permission was refused by a majority of 2,654\r\nvotes. The power was obtained afterwards.\r\n\r\n~Anti-Church-Rate Meetings~ were frequent enough at one period of our\r\nhistory. The two most worthy of remembrance were those of Dec. 15, 1834,\r\nwhen the rate was refused by a majority of 4,966 votes, and Oct., 1841,\r\nwhen the polling showed 626 for the rate and 7,281 against.\r\n\r\n~Anti-Corn-Law Meetings~ were also numerous. The one to recollect is\r\nthat held Feb. 18, 1842.\r\n\r\n~Anti-Papal Demonstration.~--A town's meeting took place in the Town\r\nHall, Dec. 11, 1850, to protest against the assumption of ecclesiastical\r\ntitles by the Catholic hierarchy. About 8,000 persons were present, and\r\nthe \"No Popery\" element was strong, but Joseph Sturge moved an amendment\r\nfor freedom to all parties, which so split the votes that the Mayor said\r\nthe amendment was not carried and the resolution was lost.\r\n\r\n~Anti-Slavery.~--The first Anti-Slavery meeting held here was that of\r\nNov. 27, 1787. A local petition to Parliament against the slave trade\r\nwas presented to the House of Commons, Feb. 11, 1788. A local society\r\nwas formed here in 1826, Joseph Sturge being secretary, and many\r\nmeetings were held before the Day of Abolition was celebrated. The most\r\nnoteworthy of these was that at Dee's Assembly Room, April 16, 1833,\r\nwhen G.F. Muntz and the Political Union opposed the agitation; a great\r\nmeeting, Oct. 14, 1835; another on Feb. 1, 1836, in which Daniel\r\nO'Connell and John Angell James took part. This last was the first large\r\ntown's meeting at which the \"total and immediate\" abolition of slavery\r\nwas demanded. Joseph Sturge following it up by going to the West Indies\r\nand reporting the hardships inflicted upon the blacks under the\r\n\"gradual\" system then in operation. Aug. 7, 1838, the day when slavery\r\ndropped its chains on English ground, was celebrated here by a\r\nchildren's festival in the Town Hall, by laying the foundation-stone of\r\n\"The Negro Emancipation Schools,\" Legge Street, and by a public meeting\r\nat night, at which Sir Eardley Wilmott, D. O'Connell, Dr. Lushington,\r\nEdward Baines, &c., were present.\r\n\r\n~Anti-one-thing-or-t'other.~--True to their motto, Birmingham people are\r\nalways ready to oppose the wrong and forward the right, but what is\r\nright and what wrong is only to be ascertained by public discussion, and\r\na few dates of celebrated \"talks\" are here given:--\r\n\r\nIn 1719 the apprenticing of Russian youths to local trades was objected\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIn the Christmas week of 1754 public protest was made against the tax on\r\nwheel carriages.\r\n\r\nMarch 12, 1824, a deputation was sent to Parliament to protest against\r\nour workmen being allowed to emigrate, for fear they should teach the\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nA proposed New Improvement Bill was vetoed by the burgesses, Dec. 18,\r\n1855. We _have_ improved a little since then!\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Confessional meeting was held Nov. 8, 1877.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Contagious Diseases Act meeting, April 19, 1877.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-giving-up-Fugitive-Slave meeting, Jan. 1, 1876, when a certain\r\nAdmiralty Circular was condemned.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Irish-Church-Establishment meeting was held June 14, 1869.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-moving-the-Cattle Market meeting Dec. 14, 1869, Smithfield being\r\npreferred to Duddeston Hall.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Railway-through-Sutton-Park meeting, April 15, 1872, but the\r\nrailway _is_ there.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Rotten-Ship-and-Sailor-drowning meeting, with Mr. Plimsoll to\r\nthe fore, May 14 1873. Another July 29, 1875.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Ashantee War meeting Sept. 29, 1873.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Turkish Atrocity meeting, Sept. 7, 1876; followed by one on Oct.\r\n2nd, properly settling the Eastern question.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Six-Million-War-Vote meeting was held on Jan. 28, 1878, when the\r\nLiberal majority was immense. A Tory opposition meeting, in support of\r\nthe vote, was held Feb. 12, when chairs and forms were broken up to use\r\nas arguments, the result being a majority of 2 to 1 for both sides.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-War meeting, May 3, 1878.\r\n\r\nAnti-Vivisection meetings. April 24, 1877, and May 6, 1878.\r\n\r\n~Apollo, Moseley Street.~--Opened as a public resort in 1786, the Rea\r\nbeing then a clear running brook. The first tenant did not prosper, for\r\nin the first week of March, 1787, the _Gazette_ contained an\r\nadvertisement that the Apollo Hotel, \"pleasantly situate in a new\r\nstreet, called Moseley Street, in the hamlet of Deritend, on the banks\r\nof the River Rea,\" with \"a spacious Bowling Green and Gardens,\" was to\r\nbe let, with or without four acres of good pasture land. When closed as\r\na licensed house, it was at first divided into two residences, but in\r\n1816 the division walls, &c., were removed, to fit it as a residence for\r\nMr. Hamper, the antiquary. That gentleman wrote that the prospect at the\r\nback was delightful, and was bounded only by Bromsgrove Lickey. The\r\nbuilding was then called \"Deritend House.\"\r\n\r\n~Aquariums.~--The Aquarium at Aston Lower Grounds was opened July 10,\r\n1879. The principal room has a length of 312 feet, the promenade being\r\n24 feet wide by 20 feet high. The west side of this spacious apartment\r\nis fitted with a number of large show tanks, where many rare and choice\r\nspecimens of marine animals and fishes may be exhibited. On a smaller\r\nscale there is an Aquarium at the \"Crystal Palace\" Garden, at Sutton\r\nColdfield, and a curiosity in the shape of an \"Aquarium Bar\" may be seen\r\nat the establishment of Mr. Bailey, in Moor Street.\r\n\r\n~Arcades.~--The Arcade between Monmouth Street and Temple Row, was\r\ncommenced April 26, 1875; first illuminated August 19, 1876, and opened\r\nfor public use on 28th of that month. It is built over that portion of\r\nthe G.W.R. line running from Monmouth Street to Temple Row, the front\r\nfacing the Great Western Hotel, occupying the site once filled by the\r\nold Quaker's burial ground. It is the property of a company, and cost\r\nnearly £100,000, the architect being Mr. W.H. Ward. The shops number 38,\r\nand in addition there are 56 offices in the galleries.--The _Central\r\nArcade_ in Corporation Street, near to New Street, and leading into\r\nCannon Street, is from the designs of the same architect and was opened\r\nSeptember 26, 1881. Underneath the Arcade proper is the Central\r\nRestaurant, and one side of the thoroughfare forms part of the shop of\r\nMessrs. Marris and Norton.--The _North-Western Arcade_, which was opened\r\nApril 5, 1884, is like a continuation of the first-named, being also\r\nbuilt over the G.W.R. tunnel, and runs from Temple Row to Corporation\r\nStreet. The architect is Mr. W. Jenkins, and the undertakers Messrs.\r\nWilkinson and Riddell, who occupy the principal frontage. Several of the\r\ntwenty-six shops into which the Arcade is divided have connection with\r\nplaces of business in Bull Street.--The _Imperial Arcade_, in Dale End,\r\nnext to St. Peter's Church, is also a private speculation (that of Mr.\r\nThos. Hall), and was opened at Christmas, 1883. It contains, in addition\r\nto the frontage, thirty-two shops, with the same number of offices\r\nabove, while the basement forms a large room suitable for meetings,\r\nauctions, &c., it being 135ft. long, 55ft. wide and nearly 15ft. high.\r\nTwo of the principal features of the Arcade are a magnificent stained\r\nwindow, looking towards St. Peters, and a curious clock, said to be the\r\nsecond of its kind in England, life-size figures of Guy, Earl of\r\nWarwick, and his Countess, with their attendants, striking the hours and\r\nquarters on a set of musical bells, the largest of which weighs about\r\n5cwt.--_Snow Hill Arcade_, opposite the railway station, and leading to\r\nSlaney Street, is an improvement due to Mr. C. Ede, who has adopted the\r\ndesigns of Mr. J.S. Davis.--The _Hen and Chickens Arcade_ has been\r\ndesigned by Mr. J.A. Cossins, for a company who purpose to build it,\r\nand, at the same time, enlarge the well-known New Street hotel of the\r\nsame name. The portico and vestibule of the hotel will form the entrance\r\nin New Street to the Arcade, which will contain two-dozen good-sized\r\nshops, a large basement room for restaurant, &c.; the out in Worcester\r\nStreet being nearly facing the Market Hall.\r\n\r\n~Area of Borough.~--Birmingham covers an area of 8,400 acres, with an\r\nestimated population of 400,680 (end of 1881), thus giving an average of\r\n47.7 persons to an acre. As a means of comparison, similar figures are\r\ngiven for a few other large towns:--\r\n\r\n\r\n              Area in    Population  Persons\r\n                Acres     in 1881    to acres\r\nBradford   ...  7,200     203,544     28.2\r\nBristol    ...  4,452     217,185     48.3\r\nLeeds      ... 21,572     326,158     15.1\r\nLeicester  ...  3,200     134,350     42.0\r\nLiverpool  ...  5,210     549,834    105.6\r\nManchester ...  4,293     364,445     84.9\r\nNottingham ...  9,960     177,964     77.9\r\nNewcastle  ...  5,372     151,822     28.3\r\nSalford    ...  5,170     194,077     37.5\r\nSheffield  ... 19,651     312,943     15.9\r\nWolverhmptn     3,396      76,850     22.6\r\n\r\n\r\n~Arms of the Borough.~--The Town Council, on the 6th day of August,\r\n1867, did resolve and declare that the Arms of the Borough should be\r\nblazoned as follows: \"1st and 4th _azure_, a bend lozengy _or_; 2nd and\r\n3rd, parti per pale _or_ and _gules_.\"--_(See cover)_.\r\n\r\n~Art and Artists.~--An \"Academy of Arts\" was organised in 1814, and an\r\nexhibition of paintings took place in Union Passage that year, but the\r\nexperiment was not repeated. A School of Design, or \"Society of Arts,\"\r\nwas started Feb. 7, 1821; Sir Robert Lawley (the first Lord Wenlock)\r\npresenting a valuable collection of casts from Grecian sculpture. The\r\nfirst exhibition was held in 1826, at The Panorama, an erection then\r\nstanding on the site of the present building in New Street, the opening\r\nbeing inaugurated by a conversazione on September 10. In 1858, the\r\nSchool of Design was removed to the Midland Institute. The \"Society of\r\nArtists\" may be said to have commenced in 1826, when several gentlemen\r\nwithdrew from the School of Design. Their number greatly increased by\r\n1842, when they took possession of the Athenæum, in which building their\r\nexhibitions were annually held until 1858. In that year they returned to\r\nNew Street, acquiring the title of \"Royal\" in 1864. The Art Students'\r\nLiterary Association was formed in September, 1869.\r\n\r\n~Art Gallery and School of Art.~--In connection with the Central Free\r\nLibrary a small gallery of pictures, works of Art, &c., loaned or\r\npresented to the town, was opened to the public August 1, 1867, and from\r\ntime to time was further enriched. Fortunately they were all removed\r\nprevious to the disastrous fire of Jan. 11, 1879. A portion of the new\r\nReference Library is at present devoted to the same purpose, pending the\r\ncompletion of the handsome edifice being erected by the Gas Committee at\r\nthe back of the Municipal Buildings, and of which it will form a part,\r\nextending from Congreve Street along Edmund Street to Eden Place. The\r\nwhole of the upper portion of the building will be devoted to the\r\npurposes of a Museum and Art Gallery, and already there has been\r\ngathered the nucleus of what promises to be one of the finest\r\ncollections in the kingdom, more particularly in respect to works of Art\r\nrelating more or less to some of the principal manufactures of\r\nBirmingham. There are a large number of valuable paintings, including\r\nmany good specimens of David Cox and other local artists; quite a\r\ngallery of portraits of gentlemen connected with the town, and other\r\nworthies; a choice collection of gems and precious stones of all kinds;\r\na number of rare specimens of Japanese and Chinese cloisonné enamels;\r\nnearly a complete set of the celebrated Soho coins and medals, with many\r\nadditions of a general character; many cases of ancient Roman, Greek,\r\nand Byzantine coins; more than an hundred almost priceless examples of\r\nold Italian carvings, in marble and stone, with some dozens of ancient\r\narticles of decorative furniture; reproductions of delicately-wrought\r\narticles of Persian Art work, plate belonging to the old City Companies,\r\nthe Universities, and from Amsterdam and the Hague; a collection of\r\nWedgwood and other ceramic ware, the gift of Messrs. R. and G. Tangye,\r\nwith thousands of other rare, costly, and beautiful things. In\r\nconnection with the Art Gallery is the \"Public Picture Gallery Fund,\"\r\nthe founder of which was the late Mr. Clarkson Osler, who gave £3,000\r\ntowards it. From this fund, which at present amounts to about £450 per\r\nyear, choice pictures are purchased as occasion offers, many others\r\nbeing presented by friends to the town, notably the works of David Cox,\r\nwhich were given by the late Mr. Joseph Nettlefold.--The _School of\r\nArt_, which is being built in Edmund Street, close to the Art Gallery,\r\nis so intimately connected therewith that it may well be noticed with\r\nit. The ground, about 1,000 square yards, has been given by Mr. Cregoe\r\nColmore, the cost of election being paid out of £10,000 given by Miss\r\nRyland, and £10,000 contributed by Messrs. Tangye. The latter firm have\r\nalso given £5,000 towards the Art Gallery; Mr. Joseph Chamberlain has\r\ncontributed liberally in paintings and in cash; other friends have\r\nsubscribed about £8,000; Mr. Nettlefold's gift was valued at £14,000,\r\nand altogether not less than £40,000 has been presented to the town in\r\nconnection with the Art Gallery, in addition to the whole cost of the\r\nSchool of Art.\r\n\r\n~Art Union.~--The first Ballot for pictures to be chosen from the Annual\r\nExhibition of Local Artists took place in 1835, the Rev. Hugh Hutton\r\nhaving the honour of originating it. The tickets were 21s. each,\r\nsubscribers receiving an engraving.\r\n\r\n~Ash, John, M.D.~--Born in 1723, was an eminent physician who practised\r\nin Birmingham for some years, but afterwards removed to London. He\r\ndevoted much attention to the analysis of mineral waters, delivered the\r\nHarveian oration in 1790, and was president of a club which numbered\r\namong its members some of the most learned and eminent men of the time.\r\nDied in 1798.\r\n\r\n~Ashford, Mary.~--Sensational trials for murder have of late years been\r\nnumerous enough, indeed, though few of them have had much local\r\ninterest, if we except that of the poisoner Palmer. The death of the\r\nunfortunate Mary Ashford, however, with the peculiar circumstance\r\nattending the trial of the supposed murderer, and the latter's appeal to\r\nthe right then existing under an old English law of a criminal's claim\r\nto a \"Trial of Battel,\" invested the case with an interest which even at\r\nthis date can hardly be said to have ceased. Few people can be found to\r\ngive credence to the possibility of the innocence of Abraham Thornton,\r\nyet a careful perusal of a history of the world-known but last \"Wager of\r\nBattel\" case, as written by the late Mr. Toulmin Smith, must lead to the\r\nbelief that the poor fellow was as much sinned against as sinning, local\r\nprejudices and indignant misrepresentations notwithstanding. So far from\r\nthe appeal to the \"Wager of Battel\" being the desperate remedy of a\r\nconvicted felon to escape the doom justly imposed upon him for such\r\nheinous offence as the murder of an innocent girl, it was simply the\r\nattempt of a clever attorney to remove the stigma attached to an\r\nunfortunate and much-maligned client. The dead body of Mary Ashford was\r\nfound in a pit of water in Sutton Coldfield, on the 27th of May, 1817,\r\nshe having been seen alive on the morning of the same day. Circumstances\r\ninstantly, and most naturally, fastened suspicion of foul play upon\r\nAbraham Thornton. He was tried at Warwick, at the Autumn Assizes of the\r\nsame year, and acquitted. The trial was a very remarkable one. Facts\r\nwere proved with unusual clearness and precision, which put it beyond\r\nthe bounds of physical possibility that he could have murdered Mary\r\nAshford. Those facts hinged on the time shown by several different\r\nclocks, compared with the standard time kept at Birmingham. But the\r\npublic feeling on the matter was intense. An engraving of the scene of\r\nthe alleged murder, with a stimulating letter-press description, was\r\npublished at the time, and the general sense undoubtedly was, that the\r\nperpetrator of a very foul murder had escaped his just doom. Hoping to\r\ndo away with this impression, a well-known local lawyer bethought\r\nhimself of the long-forgotten \"Appeal of Murder,\" trusting that by a\r\nsecond acquittal Thornton's innocence would be acknowledged by all.\r\nThough the condition of all the parties was but humble, friends soon\r\ncame forward with funds and good advice, so that within the year and a\r\nday which the law allowed, proceedings were taken in the name of William\r\nAshford (Mary's brother, who, as next heir, according to the old law,\r\nhad the sole power of pardon in such a case) for an \"Appeal of Murder\"\r\nagainst Abraham Thornton. What followed is here given in Mr. Toulmin\r\nSmith's own words:--\"I have seen it stated, hot indignation colouring\r\nimagination, that here was a weak stripling nobly aroused to avenge the\r\ndeath of his sister, by tendering himself to do battle against the tall\r\nstrong man who was charged with her murder. The facts, as they stand are\r\ntruly striking enough; but this melodramatic spectacle does not formally\r\ntrue part of them.\" A writ of \"Appeal of Murder\" was soon issued. It\r\nbears the date of 1st October, 1817. Under that writ Thornton was again\r\narrested by the Sheriff of Warwick. On the first day of Michaelmas Term,\r\nin the same year, William Ashford appeared in the Court of King's Bench\r\nat Westminster, as _appellant_, and Abraham Thornton, brought up on writ\r\nof _habeas corpus_, appeared as _appellee_. The charge of murder was\r\nformally made by the appellant; and time to plead to this charge was\r\ngranted to the appellee until Monday, 16th November.--It must have been\r\na strange and startling scene, on the morning of that Monday, 16th\r\nNovember, 1817, when Abraham Thornton stood at the bar of the Court of\r\nKing's Bench in Westminster Hall; a scene which that ancient Hall had\r\nnot witnessed within the memory of any living man, but which must have\r\nthen roused the attention of even its drowsiest haunter. \"The appellee\r\nbeing brought into Court and placed at the bar\" (I am quoting the\r\noriginal dry technical record of the transaction), \"and the appellant\r\nbeing also in court, the count [charge] was again read over to him, and\r\nhe [Thornton] was called upon to plead. He pleaded as follows;--'Not\r\nGuilty; and I am ready to defend the same by my body.' And thereupon,\r\ntaking his glove off, he threw it on the floor of the Court.\" That is to\r\nsay, Ashford having \"appealed\" Thornton of the murder, Thornton claimed\r\nthe right to maintain his own innocence by \"Trial of Battel;\" and so his\r\nanswer to the charge was a \"Wager of Battel.\" And now the din of fight\r\nseemed near, with the Court of King's Bench at Westminster for the\r\narena, and the grave Judges of that Court for the umpires. But the case\r\nwas destined to add but another illustration to what Cicero tells us of\r\nhow, oftentimes, arms yield to argument, and the swordsman's looked-for\r\nlaurel vanishes before the pleader's tongue. William Ashford, of course,\r\nacting under the advice of those who really promoted the appeal,\r\ndeclined to accept Thornton's wager of battel. Instead of accepting it,\r\nhis counsel disputed the right of Thornton to wage his battel in this\r\ncase; alleging, in a very long plea, that there were presumptions of\r\nguilt so strong as to deprive him of that right. Thornton answered this\r\nplea by another, in which all the facts that had been proved on the\r\ntrial at Warwick were set forth at great length. And then the case was\r\nvery elaborately argued, for three days, by two eminent and able\r\ncounsel, one of whom will be well remembered by most readers as the late\r\nChief-Justice Tindal. Tindal was Thornton's counsel. Of course I cannot\r\ngo here into the argument. The result was, that, on 16th April, 1881,\r\nthe full Court (Lord Ellenborough, and Justices Bayley, Abbott, and\r\nHolroyd) declared themselves _unanimously_ of opinion that the appellee\r\n(Thornton) was entitled to, wage his battel, no presumptions of guilt\r\nhaving been shown clear enough or strong enough to deprive him of that\r\nright. Upon this, Ashford, not having accepted the wager of battel, the\r\n\"appeal\" was stayed, and Thornton was discharged. Thus no reversal took\r\nplace of the previous acquittal of Thornton by the Jury at Warwick\r\nAssizes. But that acquittal had nothing whatever to do with any \"trial\r\nby battel;\" for I have shown that the \"wager of battel\" arose out of a\r\nproceeding later than and consequent upon that acquittal, and that this\r\n\"wager of battel\" never reached the stage of a \"trial by battel.\"\r\n\r\nWhat became of Thornton is unknown, but he is supposed to have died in\r\nAmerica, where he fled to escape the obloquoy showered upon him by an\r\nunforgiving public. The adage that \"murder will out\" has frequently\r\nproved correct, but in this case it has not, and the charge against\r\nThornton is reiterated in every account of this celebrated trial that\r\nhas been published, though his innocence cannot now be doubted.\r\n\r\n~Ashted,~ now a populous part of the town, takes its name from Dr. Ash,\r\nwhose residence was transformed into Ashted Church, the estate being\r\nlaid out for building in 1788.\r\n\r\n~Assay Marks.~--These consist of the initials of the maker, the Queen's\r\nhead for the duty (17/-on gold, 1/6 on silver, per oz.), a letter\r\n(changed yearly) for date, an anchor for the Birmingham office mark, and\r\nthe standard or value mark, which is given in figures, thus:--for gold\r\nof 22-carat fineness (in oz. of 24) a crown and 22; 18-carat, a crown\r\nand 18; 15-carat, 15.625; 12-carat, 12.5; 9-carat, 9.375. The value mark\r\nfor silver of 11 oz. 10 dwts. (in lb. of 12 oz.) is the figure of\r\nBritannia; for 11 oz. 2 dwts. a lion passant. The date letter is changed\r\nin July. At present it is k. The lower standards of 15, 12, and 9-carat\r\ngold (which are not liable to duty), were authorised by an Order in\r\nCouncil, of December 22, 1854, since which date an immense increase has\r\ntaken place in the quantity assayed in Birmingham.\r\n\r\n~Assay Office.~--There are seven Assay Offices in the country, the\r\nBirmingham one being established by special Act in 1773, for the\r\nconvenience of silversmiths and plateworkers. A few hours per week was\r\nsufficient for the business at that time, and it was conducted at the\r\nKing's Head in New Street; afterwards, in 1782, in Bull Lane, in 1800 at\r\na house in Little Colmore Street, and from 1816 at the old Baptist\r\nChapel in Little Cannon Street. In 1824 the Act 5, George IV., cap 52,\r\nincorporated the assay of gold, the guardians being 36 in number, from\r\nwhom are chosen the wardens. On July 14, 1877, the foundation stone was\r\nlaid of the New Assay Office in Newhall Street, and it was opened for\r\nbusiness June 24, 1878.\r\n\r\n~Assizes.~--Birmingham was \"proclaimed\" an assize town January 14, 1859,\r\nbut the first assizes were held in July, 1884.\r\n\r\n~Aston.~--Eight hundred years ago, Aston filled a small space in the\r\nDomesday book of history, wherein it is stated that the estate consisted\r\nof eight hides of land, and three miles of wood, worth £5, with 44\r\nresidents (one being a priest), and 1,200 acres in cultivation. The\r\npresent area of Aston Manor is 943 acres, on which are built about\r\n14,000 houses, having a population of some 60,000 persons, and a\r\nrateable value of £140,000. In the first ten years of the existence of\r\nthe Local Board (1869 to 1878) £30,000 was spent on main drainage works,\r\n£10,000 in public improvements, and £53,000 in street improvements.\r\nAston has now its Public Buildings, Free Library, &c., as well as an\r\nenergetic School Board, and, though unsuccessful in its attempt in 1876\r\nto obtain a charter of incorporation, there can be little doubt but that\r\nit will ultimately bloom forth in all the glories of a Mayor, Aldermen,\r\nand Burgesses. Aston parish, which extends in several directions into\r\nthe borough of Birmingham, has an area of 13,786 acres.\r\n\r\n~Aston Almshouses~ were built in 1655, according to the provisions made\r\nby Sir Thomas Holte previous to his decease.\r\n\r\n~Aston Church~ was probably built about the year 1170, the nave and part\r\nof chancel being added in 1231, the east end and arch of chancel in\r\n1310, and the tower and spire in 1440. The old building, which contained\r\nan interesting collection of monuments in memory of the Holtes, the\r\nArdens, the Erdingtons, and other county families, has been lately\r\nenlarged by the extension of the nave and aisles eastward, and widening\r\nthe chancel so as to accommodate about 1,200 people, instead of 500. The\r\nwhole of the monuments have been replaced in their relative positions.\r\n\r\n~Aston Cross Tavern~ was opened as a licensed house and tea gardens in\r\n1775, the first landlord, Mr. Barron, dying in 1792, his widow keeping\r\nit till her death in 1817. Of late years it has been a favourite resort\r\nof all classes of athletes, though from being so closely built to it has\r\nlost much of the attraction which drew our grandfathers to its shady\r\narbours when on country pleasure bent. The park wall extended to the\r\ncorner of and along the side of Park Lane, opposite the tavern.\r\n\r\n~Aston Hall and Park.~--This building was commenced by Sir Thomas Holte\r\nin April, 1618, and finished in April, 1635, Inigo Jones being\r\naccredited with the design. King Charles I., in his days of trouble,\r\npaid a short visit to the Hall, his host being punished afterwards by\r\nsome of Cromwell's soldiers and the malcontents of Birmingham besieging\r\nthe place in the week after Christmas, 1643. The brick wall round the\r\npark, nearly three miles long, but of which there are now few traces\r\nleft, was put up by Sir Lister Holte about 1750, and tradition says it\r\nwas paid for by some Staffordshire coal-masters, who, supposing that\r\ncoal lay underneath, conditioned with Sir Lister that no mines should be\r\nsunk within [word missing--presume \"its\"] boundary. The Hall and Park\r\nwere held by the various generations of the family till the death of the\r\nlate Dowager Lady Holte. (For an accurate and interesting description of\r\nthe edifice see Davidson's \"Holtes of Aston.\") The Act authorising the\r\nsale of the Aston estates received the royal sanction on July 10, 1817,\r\nand the sale of the furniture and effects in the Hall was commenced by\r\nMessrs. J. and C. Robins on September 22. The sale lasted nine days,\r\nthere being 1,144 lots, which realised £2,150; the farming stock, &c.,\r\nbeing sold afterwards for £1,201. The Hall and Park was put up on April\r\n15, 1818, and was bought by Messrs. Greenway, Greaves, and Whitehead,\r\nbankers, of Warwick, the estate of 1,530 acres being let off by them in\r\nsuitable lots. The herd of deer, reduced to 150 head, was sold December\r\n21. The Hall was rented by Mr. James Watt, son of _the_ James Watt, and\r\nfor many years it was closed to the public. At his death, in 1848, the\r\nchanges which had been going on all round for years begin to make\r\nthemselves seen in the shape of huge gaps in the old wall, houses\r\nspringing up fast here and there, and a street being cut through the\r\nnoble avenue of chestnut trees in 1852. By degrees, the park was reduced\r\nto 370 acres, which, with the Hall, were offered to the town in 1850 for\r\nthe sum of £130,000; but the Town Council declined the bargain, though\r\nless than one-half of the Park (150 acres) was sold immediately after\r\nfor more than all the money. In 1857 a \"People's Park\" Company was\r\nstarted to \"Save Aston Hall\" and the few acres close round it, an\r\nagreement being entered into for £35,000. Many of the 20s. shares were\r\ntaken up, and Her Majesty the Queen performed the opening ceremony June\r\n15, 1858. The speculation proved a failure, as out of about £18,000\r\nraised one-half went in repairs, alterations, losses, &c., and it would\r\nhave been lost to the town had not the Corporation bought it in\r\nFebruary, 1864. They gave £33,000 (£7,000 being private subscriptions),\r\nand it was at last opened as a free park, September 22, 1864. The\r\npicture gallery is 136ft. long, by 18ft. wide and 16ft. high. In this\r\nand various other rooms, will be found a miscellaneous museum of\r\ncuriosities, more or less rare, including stuffed birds and animals,\r\nancient tapestry and furniture, &c.\r\n\r\n~Aston Lower Grounds,~ the most beautiful pleasure grounds in the\r\nMidland counties, cover 31 acres, and were originally nothing more than\r\nthe kitchen and private gardens and the fish-ponds belonging to Aston\r\nHall, and were purchased at the sale in 1818 by the Warwick bankers, who\r\nlet them to Mr. H.G. Quilter, at the time an attempt was made to\r\npurchase the Hall and Park \"by the people.\" Adding to its attractions\r\nyear by year, Mr. Quilter remained on the ground until 1878, when a\r\nlimited liability company was formed to take to the hotel and premises,\r\nbuilding an aquarium 320 feet long by 54 feet wide, an assembly-room,\r\n220 feet long, by 91 feet wide, and otherwise catering for the comfort\r\nof their visitors, 10,000 of whom can be now entertained and amused\r\nunder shelter, in case of wet weather. Mr. Quilter's selling price was\r\n£45,000, taking £25,000 in shares, and £20,000 cash by instalments. The\r\nspeculation did not appear to be very successful, and the property is\r\nnow in private hands. The visitors to the Lower Grounds since 1864 have\r\naveraged 280,000 per annum.\r\n\r\n~Asylum,~ in Summer Lane, was opened in July 1797, by the Guardians of\r\nthe Poor as an industrial residence and school for 250 children. It was\r\ndismantled and closed in 1846, though the \"Beehive\" carved over the door\r\nwas allowed to remain on the ruins some years after.\r\n\r\n~Athenæum~--For the \"diffusion of Literature and Science\" was\r\nestablished in March, 1839, but has long been merged in the Midland\r\nInstitute. In the building called the \"Athenæum\", top of Temple Street,\r\nsome of the early exhibitions of paintings were held.\r\n\r\n~Athenic Institute,~ founded in 1841, was an institute of a somewhat\r\nsimilar character to the Athenæum, though including athletics, and\r\nexisted no longer.\r\n\r\n~Athletic Clubs.~--The first festival of the Birmingham Athletic Club\r\nwas held in 1868. On the 1st of March, 1880, an association was\r\norganised of many of the bicycle clubs, cricket clubs, football clubs,\r\nand similar athletic bodies in the town and neighbourhood, under the\r\nname of \"The Midland Counties Amateurs' Athletic Union.\"\r\n\r\n~Atlantic Cables.~--It would have been strange if Birmingham had not had\r\na hand in the making of these. For the cable laid in 1865, 16,000 miles\r\nof copper wire, weighing 308 tons, were turned out by Messrs. Bolton and\r\nSons and Messrs. Wilkes and Sons. The cable itself was 2,300 (nautical)\r\nmiles in length.\r\n\r\n~Baby Show.~--Let Mr. Inshaw, of the \"Steam Clock,\" have the _honour_ of\r\nbeing recorded as the first to introduce the Yankee notion of a \"baby\r\nshow,\" which took place at his Music Hall, May 15, 1874.\r\n\r\n~Bachelors.~--In 1695, bachelors over 24 had to pay a tax of 1s., if \"a\r\ncommon person,\" the scale running as high as £12 10s. for a duke!\r\nJudging from the increase of the population about that time, we doubt if\r\neven a \"common\" bachelor paid here. The married folks had not much to\r\nlaugh at though, for they had to pay duty on every child that was born.\r\nFunny time, those!\r\n\r\n~Balloons.~--A Mr. Harper was the first to scale the clouds in a balloon\r\nfrom this town, January 4, 1785. He rose again on the 31, from the\r\nTennis Court, in Coleshill Street, and is said to have sailed a distance\r\nof 57 miles in 80 minutes. Mr. Sadler went up from Vauxhall, October\r\n7th, 1811, and again on October 20th, 1823. Mr. Green rose from Newhall\r\nHill, July 17th, 1827, and several times after.\r\n\r\n~Balsall Heath.~--In some ancient deeds called \"Boswell Heath.\" The land\r\nround Mary street, known as the Balsall Heath estate, was sold in\r\nbuilding lots (234) in 1839, the last day's sale being August 26, and\r\nthe auctioneers, Messrs. E. & C. Robins. Edwardes-street takes its name\r\nfrom the last owner of the estate, who, if he could now but glance over\r\nthe property, would be not a little astonished at the changes which have\r\ntaken place in the last forty years, for, like unto Aston, it may be\r\nsaid to really form but a portion of the ever-extending town of\r\nBirmingham. Balsall Heath, which is in the parish of King's Norton, has\r\nnow a Local Board (with its offices in Lime Grove, Moseley Road) several\r\nBoard schools, chapels, and churches, a police court, and that sure mark\r\nof advancement, a local newspaper. One thing still wanting, however, is\r\na cemetery. Though an appropriate and convenient spot near Cannon Hill\r\nPark was chosen for the last resting-place, the ratepayers, at a meeting\r\nheld July 21, 1879, decided that they could not yet afford the required\r\noutlay of some £17,000 necessary for the purpose, notwithstanding that\r\nthe annual rateable value of the property in the neighbourhood is\r\nsomething like £70,000, and increasing by three to four thousand a year.\r\n\r\n~Banks and Bankers.~--The Birmingham Branch Bank of England (drawing on\r\nthe parent Bank of England), is in Bennett's Hill.\r\n\r\nThe local Branch of the National Provincial Bank of England (Lim.),\r\nBennett's Hill, also draws on its headquarters. It commenced business\r\nhere on New Year's Day 1827.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham Banking Company (Lim.), also in Bennett's Hill, draws on\r\nthe London and Westminster. It opened its doors Sept. 1, 1829, with a\r\nnominal capital of £500,000, in £50 shares, £5 being paid up at\r\nstarting. An amalgamation took place in the year 1880 with the\r\nStourbridge and Kidderminster Bank (established in 1834) the united\r\ncompany having a paid-up capital of £286,000 and a reserve of £312,000.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham and Midland Bank (Limited) opened in Union Street, August\r\n23, 1836, removing to New Street in 1869. London agents, the Union Bank\r\nof London. Authorised capital, £2,400,000.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham, Dudley, and District Banking Co. (Limited) was commenced\r\nin Colmore Row July 1st, 1836, as the Town and District Bank, with a\r\ncapital of £500,000, in £20 shares. London agents, Barclay and Co., and\r\nWilliams and Co.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham Joint Stock Bank (Limited) opened in Temple Row West,\r\nJan. 1st, 1862, with a capital of £3,000,000, in £100 shares, £10 paid.\r\nAgents, London Joint Stock. Has branches in New Street and Great Hampton\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nLloyds' Banking Co. (Limited) Colmore Row, dates from June 3rd, 1765.\r\nwhen it was known as Taylor and Lloyds, their first premises being in\r\nDale End [hence the name of Bank Passage]. This old established firm has\r\nincorporated during its century of existence a score of other banks, and\r\nlately has been amalgamated with Barnetts, Hoares, and Co., of London,\r\nthe present name being Lloyd, Barnett, Bosanquet, and Co. (Limited).\r\nThere are sub-offices also in Great Hampton Street, Deritend, Five Ways\r\nand Aston. In this and adjoining counties, Lloyds' number about 40\r\nbranch establishments.\r\n\r\nThe Worcester City and County Banking Co. (Limited), drawing on Glynn\r\nand Co., removed from Cherry Street to their newly-built edifice in\r\nColmore Row, June 1, 1880.\r\n\r\nThe Union Bank of Birmingham (Limited), Waterloo Street, commenced\r\nbusiness with a nominal capital of £1,000,000, in £20 shares, £5 paid.\r\nLondon agents, the City Bank. It has since been taken over by the\r\nMidland Bank.\r\n\r\n~Banks.~--A popular Penny Bank was established in 1851, but came to\r\ngrief in 1865, closing March 16, with assets £1,608, to pay debts\r\n£9,448. Another penny bank was opened in Granville Street, April 13,\r\n1861, and is still carried on at the Immanuel Schools, Tennant Street,\r\nwith about 5,000 depositors at the present time.\r\n\r\nA Local Savings Bank was opened in May, 1827, and legalised in the year\r\nafter, but ultimately its business was transferred to the Post Office\r\nSavings Bank, which opened its doors in Cannon Street, Dec. 1, 1863. By\r\na Government return, it appeared that at the end of 1880 the total\r\namount to the credit of depositors in the Post Office Savings Banks of\r\nthe Kingdom stood at £30,546,306. After the Metropolitan counties of\r\nMiddlesex, Surrey, and Kent, Warwickshire comes next with a deposit of\r\n£1,564,815, the average for the whole of the English counties being but\r\nlittle over £500,000.\r\n\r\n~Banks Defunct.~--The old-established concern known so long as Attwood\r\nand Spooner's closed its doors March 10, 1865, with liabilities\r\namounting to £1,007,296. The Joint Stock Bank took the business, and\r\npaid 11s. 3d. in the £.\r\n\r\nBank of Deposit stopped Oct. 26, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe Borough Bank, a branch of Northern and Central Bank of England,\r\nstopped Feb. 24, 1840.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial (Branch) Bank, closed July 27, 1840.\r\n\r\nCoates, Woolley and Gordon, who occupied the premises at corner of\r\nCherry Street and Cannon Street in 1814, was joined to Moilliet's, and\r\nby them to Lloyds.\r\n\r\nFreer, Rotton, Lloyds and Co., of 1814, changed to Rotton, Onions and\r\nCo., then Rotton and Scholefield, next to Rotton and Son, and lastly\r\nwith its manager transferred to National Provincial.\r\n\r\nGalton, Galton and James, of 1814, retired in 1830.\r\n\r\nGibbins, Smith, and Co. failed in 1825, paying nearly 20s. in the £.\r\n\r\nGibbins and Lowell, opened in 1826, but was joined to Birmingham Banking\r\nCo. in 1829.\r\n\r\nSmith, Gray, Cooper and Co., of 1815, afterwards Gibbins, Smith, and\r\nGoode, went in 1825.\r\n\r\n~Banknotes.~--Notes for 5/3 were issued in 1773. 300 counterfeit £1\r\nnotes, dated 1814, were found near Heathfield House, January 16, 1858. A\r\nnoted forger of these shams is said to have resided in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood about the period named on the discovered \"flimsies.\" When\r\nBoulton and Watt were trying to get the Act passed patenting their\r\ncopying-press the officials of the Bank of England opposed it for fear\r\nit should lead to forgery of their notes, and several Members of\r\nParliament actually tried to copy banknotes as they did their letters.\r\n\r\n~Bankrupts.~--In the year 1882 (according to the _Daily Post_) there\r\nwere 297 bankruptcies, compositions, or liquidations in Birmingham, the\r\ntotal amount of debts being a little over £400,000. The dividends ranged\r\nfrom 2d. to 15s. in the £, one-half the whole number, however, realising\r\nunder 1s. 6d. The estimated aggregate loss to creditors is put at\r\n£243,000.\r\n\r\n~Baptists.~--As far back as 1655, we have record of meetings or\r\nconferences of the Baptist churches in the Midland district, their\r\nrepresentatives assembling at Warwick on the second day of the third\r\nmonth, and at Moreton-in-the-Marsh, on the 26th of the fourth month in\r\nthat year. Those were the Cromwellian days of religious freedom, and we\r\nare somewhat surprised that no Birmingham Baptists should be among those\r\nwho gathered together at the King's Head, at Moreton, on the last named\r\ndate, as we find mention made of brethren from Warwick, Tewkesbury,\r\nAlcester, Derby, Bourton-on-the-Water, Hook Norton,\r\nMoreton-in-the-Marsh, and even of there being a community of the same\r\npersuasion at Cirencester. The conference of the Midland Counties'\r\nDistrict Association of Baptist Churches met in this town for the first\r\ntime in 1740.--For Chapels see \"_Places of Worship_.\"\r\n\r\n~Barr Beacon.~--A trial was made on January 10, 1856, as to how far a\r\nlight could be seen by the ignition of a beacon on Malvern Hills. It was\r\nsaid to have been seen from Snowdon in Wales (105 miles), and at other\r\nparts of the country at lesser distances, though the gazers at Worcester\r\nsaw it not. The look-out at Dudley Castle (26 miles) could have passed\r\nthe signal on to Barr Beacon, but it was not needed, as the Malvern\r\nlight was not only seen there, but still away on at Bardon Hill,\r\nLeicester.--Many persons imagine that Barr Beacon is the highest spot in\r\nthe Midland Counties, but the idea is erroneous, Turners Hill, near Lye\r\nCross, Rowley Regis, which is 893 ft. above mean sea level, being\r\nconsiderably higher, while the Clee Hills reach an altitude of 1,100 ft.\r\n\r\n~Barber of Birmingham, The.~--The knights of the pole (or poll) have\r\nalways been noted for getting into mischief, and it is not therefore so\r\nvery surprising to find that in March, 1327, a royal pardon had to be\r\ngranted to \"Roger, the barber of Birmingham,\" for the part he had taken\r\nin the political disturbances of that time. Was he a Con., or a Lib.,\r\nTory or Rad.?\r\n\r\n~Baron of Birmingham.~--One of the titles of Lord Ward.\r\n\r\n~Barracks.~--Built in 1793, at a cost of £13,000, as a consequence of\r\nthe riots of 1791.\r\n\r\n~Barring Out~--On the 26th of Nov. 1667, the scholars of the Grammar\r\nSchool \"barred out\" the Master, and then left the school for a time.\r\nWhen they returned they found the worthy pedagogue had obtained\r\nadmission and intended to keep his young rebels outside. Whereupon, says\r\nan old chronicler, they, being reinforced by certain of the townsmen \"in\r\nvizards, and with pistolls and other armes,\" sought to re-enter by\r\nassault, threatening to kill the Master, and showering stones and bricks\r\nthrough the windows. When the fun was over the Governors passed a law\r\nthat any boy taking part in future \"barrings-out\" should be expelled\r\nfrom the School, but the amusement seems to have been rather popular, as\r\nan entry in the School records some ten years later show that a certain\r\nWidow Spooner was paid one shilling \"for cleansinge ye Schoole at\r\npenninge out.\"\r\n\r\n~Baskerville (John).~--This celebrated local worthy was a native of\r\nWolverley, near Kidderminster, having been born in the year 1706. He\r\ncame to this town in early life, as we find that he kept a writing\r\nschool in 1726. In 1745 he built himself a residence at Easy-hill, and\r\ncarried on the business of japanner afterwards adding to it that of\r\nprinter and typefounder. His achievements in this line have made his\r\nname famous for ever, though it is said that he spent £600 before he\r\ncould produce one letter to his own satisfaction, and some thousands\r\nbefore he obtained any profits from his printing trade. He was somewhat\r\neccentric in personal matters of dress and taste, his carriage (drawn by\r\ncream-coloured horses) being a wonderful specimen of the art of\r\njapanning in the way of pictured panels, etc., while he delighted to\r\nadorn his person in the richest style of dress. The terms of his\r\npeculiar will, and his apparent renunciation of Christianity, were\r\nalmost as curious as his choice of a place of sepulture. He was buried\r\nin his own grounds under a solid cone of masonry, where his remains lay\r\nuntil 1821, at which time the canal wharf, now at Easy Row, was being\r\nmade. His body was found in a good state of preservation, and for some\r\nshort period was almost made a show of, until by the kindness of Mr.\r\nKnott the bookseller, it was taken to Us present resting-place in one of\r\nthe vaults under Christ Church. Mr. Baskerville died January 8, 1775,\r\nhis widow living till March 21, 1787, to the age of 80 years.\r\n\r\n~Baths.~--Ladywell Baths were said by Hutton to be the most complete in\r\nthe island, being seven in number, that for swimmers 36 yards long by 18\r\nwide, and cost £2,000. The place is now occupied by a timber yard, the\r\nold spring being covered in, though fitted with a pump for public use.\r\nFor many years a tribe of water carriers procured a living by retailing\r\nthe water at a halfpenny per can. The red sand from the New Street\r\ntunnels was turned to account in tilling up the old baths, much to the\r\nadvantage of Mr. Turner, the lessee, and of the hauliers who turned the\r\nhonest penny by turning in so near at hand.\r\n\r\n~Baths and Wash-houses.~--The local movement for the establishment of\r\npublic Baths first took practical shape at a meeting held Nov. 19,1844,\r\nwithin a week of which date subscriptions amounting to £4,430 were\r\nreceived for the purpose. The Association then formed purchased a plot\r\nof land in Kent Street in June, 1846, and presented it to the Town\r\nCouncil in November following, though the Baths erected thereon were not\r\nopened to the public until May 12, 1851. It was at that time imagined\r\nthat the working classes would be glad of the boon provided for them in\r\nthe convenient wash-houses attached to the Baths proper, and the chance\r\ngiven them to do away with all the sloppy, steamy annoyances of\r\nwashing-day at home, but the results proved otherwise, and the\r\nwash-houses turned out to be not wanted. The Woodcock Street\r\nestablishment was opened August 27, 1860; Northwood Street, March 5,\r\n1862; Sheepcote Street in 1878, and Ladywood in 1882. Turkish Baths are\r\nnow connected with the above, and there are also private speculations of\r\nthe same kind in High Street, Broad Street, and the Crescent. Hardy\r\nswimmers, who prefer taking their natatory exercises in the open air,\r\nwill find provision made for them at the Reservoir, at Cannon Hill Park,\r\nand also at Small Heath Park. The swimming-bath in George Street,\r\nBalsall Heath, opened in 1846, was filled up in 1878, by order of the\r\nLocal Board of Health.\r\n\r\n~Bath Street~ takes its name from some baths formerly in Blews Street,\r\nbut which, about 1820, were turned into a malthouse.\r\n\r\n~Battle Of the Alma.~--A disturbance which took place at a steeplechase\r\nmeeting at Aston, Monday, March 26, 1855, received this grandiloquent\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n~Battles and Sieges.~--It is more than probable that the British, under\r\ntheir gallant Queen Boadicea, fought the Romans more than once in the\r\nnear vicinity of this district, and very possibly in those happy days of\r\nfeudalism, which followed the invasion of the Normans, when every knight\r\nand squire surrounded himself with his armed retainers, sundry\r\nskirmishes may have taken place hereabouts, but history is silent. Even\r\nof the battle of Barnet (April 14, 1471), when the Earl of Warwick and\r\n10,000 men were slain, we have not sufficient note to say, though it can\r\nhardly be doubted, that many Birmingham citizens went down. But still we\r\nhave on record one real \"Battle of Birmingham,\" which took place on the\r\n3rd of April, 1643. On that day our town was attacked by Prince Rupert,\r\nwith some 2,000 horse and foot; being pretty stoutly opposed, his\r\nsoldiers slew a number of inhabitants, burnt nearly 80 houses, and did\r\ndamage (it is said) to the extent of £30,000. It took five days for the\r\nnews of this exploit to reach London. In the week following Christmas of\r\nthe same year, a number of townspeople, aided by a party of the\r\nCommonwealth soldiers, laid siege to, and captured, Aston Hall.\r\n\r\n~Bazaars.~--When originated none can tell. How much good done by means\r\nof them, nobody knows. But that immense amounts have been raised for\r\ngood and charitable purposes, none can deny--and then, \"they are _such_\r\nfun!\". \"Grand Bazaars\" have been held for many an institution, and by\r\nmany different sects and parties, and to attempt to enumerate them would\r\nbe an impossibility, but the one on behalf of the Queen's Hospital, held\r\nin April, 1880, is noteworthy, for two reasons:--first, because the\r\nproceeds amounted to the munificent sum of £5,969, and, secondly, from\r\nthe novelty of the decorations. The body of the Town Hall was arranged\r\nto represent an English street of the olden time, a baronial castle\r\nrising tower upon tower at the great gallery end, and an Elizabethan\r\nmansion in the orchestra, with a lawn in front, occupied by a military\r\nband. The sides of the Hall constituted a double row of shops, the upper\r\nstoreys (reaching to the galleries) being filled with casements and\r\nbalconies, from whence the doings in the street could be witnessed.\r\n\r\n~Bean Club.~--The first anniversary we read of was that held July 17,\r\n1752, at which meeting Lord Fielding gave £120 to erect an altarpiece in\r\nSt. Bartholomew's.\r\n\r\n~Beardsworth (John).~--Founder of the Repository, began life as driver\r\nof a hackney coach, in which one night he drove a beautiful young lady\r\nto a ball. John went home, dressed, procured admission to the ball,\r\ndanced with the lady, handed her to the coach, drove her home, and some\r\ntime after married her. The lady's cash enabled him to acquire an ample\r\nfortune, being at one time worth nearly a quarter of a million, most of\r\nwhich, however, was lost on the turf. The Repository was the largest\r\nestablishment of the kind in the kingdom, and Beardsworth'a house\r\nadjoining was furnished in most splendid style, one centre table (made\r\nof rich and rare American wood) costing £1,500.\r\n\r\n~Beelzebub.~--Watt's first steam engine was so christened. It was\r\nbrought from Scotland, put up at Soho, and used for experimenting upon.\r\nIt was replaced by \"Old Bess,\" the first engine constructed upon the\r\nexpansive principle. This latter engine is now in the Museum of Patents,\r\nSouth Kensington, though Mr. Smiles says he saw it working in 1857,\r\nseventy years after it was made.\r\n\r\n~Beer.~--Brewers of beer were first called upon to pay a license duty in\r\n1784, though the sellers thereof had been taxed more or less for 250\r\nyears previously. The effect of the heavy duties then imposed was to\r\nreduce the consumption of the national and wholesome beverage, which in\r\n1782 averaged one barrel per head of the then population per annum, down\r\nto half-a-barrel per head in 1830, its place being filled by an\r\nincreased consumption of ardent spirits, which from half-a-gallon per\r\nhead in 1782, rose by degrees to six-sevenths of a gallon per head by\r\n1830. In this year, the statesmen of the day, who thought more of the\r\nwell-being of the working part of the population than raising money by\r\nthe taxation of their necessaries, took off the 10s. per barrel on beer,\r\nin the belief that cheap and good malt liquors would be more likely to\r\nmake healthy strong men than an indulgence in the drinking of spirits.\r\nNotwithstanding all the wild statements of the total abstainers to the\r\ncontrary, the latest Parliamentary statistics show that the consumption\r\nof beer per head per annum averages _now_ only seven-eighths of a\r\nbarrel, though before even this moderate quantity reaches the consumers,\r\nthe Government takes [see Inland Revenue returns, 1879, before\r\nalteration of malt-tax] no less a sum than £19,349 per year from the\r\ngood people of Birmingham alone. Of this sum the brewers paid £9,518,\r\nthe maltsters £425, beer dealers £2,245, and beer retailers £7,161.\r\n\r\n~Bells.~--There was a bell foundry at Good Knave's End, in 1760, from\r\nwhence several neighbouring churches were supplied with bells to summon\r\nthe good knaves of the day to prayers, or to toll the bad knaves to\r\n_their_ end. There was also one at Holloway Head, in 1780, but the\r\nbusiness must have been hollow enough, for it did not go ahead, and we\r\nfind no record of church bells being cast here until just a hundred\r\nyears back (1732), when Messrs. Blews & Son took up the trade.\r\nBirmingham bells have, however, made some little noise in the world, and\r\nmay still be heard on sea or land, near and far, in the shape of door\r\nbells, ship bells, call bells, hand bells, railway bells, sleigh bells,\r\nsheep bells, fog bells, mounted on rockbound coasts to warn the weary\r\nmariner, or silver bells, bound with coral from other coasts, to soothe\r\nthe toothless babbler. These, and scores of others, are ordered here\r\nevery year by thousands; but the strangest of all orders must have been\r\nthat one received by a local firm some fifteen years ago from a West\r\nAfrican prince, who desired them to send him 10,000 house bells (each\r\n3/4 lb. weight), wherewith to adorn his iron \"palace.\" And he had them!\r\nEdgar Poe's bells are nowhere, in comparison with\r\n\r\n  Such a charm, such a chime,\r\n  Out of tune, out of time.\r\n  Oh, the jangling and the wrangling\r\n  Of ten thousand brazen throats.\r\n\r\n Ten bells were put in St. Martin's, in 1786, the total weight being 7\r\ntons, 6 cwt. 2 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe peal of ten bells in St. Philip's were first used August 7, 1751,\r\nthe weight being 9 tons 10 cwt. 22 lbs., the tenor weighs 30 cwt.\r\n\r\nA new peal of eight bells were put up in Aston Church, in May, 1776, the\r\ntenor weighing 21 cwt. The St. Martin's Society of Change Ringers\r\n\"opened\" them, July 15, by ringing Holt's celebrated peal of 5040\r\ngrandsire triples, the performance occupying 3 hours 4 minutes.\r\n\r\nEight bells and a clock were mounted in the tower of Deritend Chapel, in\r\n1776, the first peal being rung July 29.\r\n\r\nThe eight bells in Bishop Ryder's Church, which weigh 55 cwt., and cost\r\n£600, were cast in 1868, by Blews and Sons, and may be reckoned as the\r\nfirst full peal founded in Birmingham.\r\n\r\nThere are eight bells in Harborne Parish Church, four of them bearing\r\ndate 1697, two with only the makers' name on, and two put in February,\r\n1877, on the 24th of which month the whole peal were inaugurated by the\r\nringing of a true peal of Stedman triples, composed by the late Thomas\r\nThurstans, and consisting of 5,040 changes, in 2 hours and 52 minutes.\r\nThe St. Martin's ringers officiated.\r\n\r\nThe six bells of Northfield Church were cast by Joseph Smith, of\r\nEdgbaston, in 1730.\r\n\r\nSt. Chad's Cathedral has eight bells, five of which were presented in\r\n1848 as a memorial to Dr. Moore; the other three, from the foundry of W.\r\nBlews and Sons, were hung in March, 1877 the peculiar ceremony of\r\n\"blessing the bells\" being performed by Bishop Ullathorne on the 22nd of\r\nthat month. The three cost £110. The bells at Erdington Catholic Church\r\nwere first used on February 2, 1878.\r\n\r\n~Bellows to Mend.~--Our townspeople bellowed a little over their losses\r\nafter Prince Rupert's rueful visit, but there was one among them who\r\nknew how to \"raise the wind,\" for we find Onions, the bellows-maker,\r\nhard at work in 1650; and his descendants keep at the same old game.\r\n\r\n~Bennett's Hill.~--There was a walled-in garden (with an old brick\r\nsummer-house) running up from Waterloo-street to Colmore-row as late as\r\n1838-9.\r\n\r\n~Benefit and Benevolent Societies.~--See \"_Friendly Societies_.\"\r\n\r\n~Bellbarn Road~, or the road to Mr. Bell's barn.\r\n\r\n~Bermingham.~--The Irish family of this name descended from Robert, son\r\nof Peter de Bermingham, who left here and settled in Connaught about the\r\nyear 1169.\r\n\r\n~Bibles and Testaments.~--In 1272 the price of a Bible, well written\r\nout, was £30 sterling, and there were few readers of it in Birmingham.\r\nThe good book can now be bought for 6d., and it is to be hoped there is\r\none in every house. The Rev. Angell James once appealed to his\r\ncongregation for subscriptions towards sending a million New Testaments\r\nto China, and the Carrslaneites responded promptly with £410 8s., enough\r\nto pay for 24,624 copies--the publisher's price being 4d. each. They can\r\nbe bought for a penny now.--A local Auxiliary Bible Society was\r\ncommenced here May 9, 1806.\r\n\r\n~Bingley Hall~--Takes its name from Bingley House, on the site of which\r\nit is built. It was erected in 1850 by Messrs. Branson and Gwyther, at a\r\ncost of about £6,000, the proprietary shares being £100 each. In form it\r\nis nearly a square, the admeasurements being 224 ft. by 212 ft., giving\r\nan area of nearly one acre and a half. There are ten entrance doors,\r\nfive in King Edward's Place, and five in King Alfred's Place, and the\r\nbuilding may be easily divided into five separate compartments. The Hall\r\nwill hold from 20,000 to 25,000 people, and is principally used for\r\nExhibitions and Cattle Shows; with occasionally \"monster meetings,\" when\r\nit is considered necessary for the welfare of the nation to save sinners\r\nor convert Conservatives.\r\n\r\n~Bird's-eye View~ of the town can be best obtained from the dome of the\r\nCouncil House, to which access may be obtained on application to the\r\nCurator. Some good views may be also obtained from some parts of Moseley\r\nRoad, Cannon Hill Park, and from Bearwood Road.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham.~--A horse of this name won the Doncaster St. Leger in 1830\r\nagainst 27 competitors. The owner, John Beardsworth, cleared £40,000. He\r\ngave Connolly, the jockey, £2,000.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham Abroad.~--Our brethren who have emigrated do not like to\r\nforget even the name of their old town, and a glance over the American\r\nand Colonial census sheet shows us that there are at least a score of\r\nother Birminghams in the world. In New Zealand there are three, and in\r\nAustralia five townships so christened. Two can be found in Canada, and\r\nten or twelve in the United States, the chief of which is Birmingham in\r\nAlabama. In 1870 this district contained only a few inhabitants, but in\r\nthe following year, with a population of 700, it was incorporated, and\r\nat once took rank as a thriving city, now proudly called \"The Iron\r\nCity,\" from its numerous ironworks, furnaces, and mills. Last year the\r\ncitizens numbered over 12,000, the annual output of pig-iron being about\r\n60,000 tons, and the coal mines in the neighbourhood turning out 2,000\r\ntons per day. The city is 240 miles from Nashville, 143 miles from\r\nChattanooga, and 96 miles from Montgomery, all thriving places, and is a\r\ncentral junction of six railways. The climate is good, work plentiful,\r\nwages fair, provisions cheap, house rent not dear, churches and schools\r\nabundant, and if any of our townsmen are thinking of emigrating they may\r\ndo a deal worse than go from hence to that other Birmingham, which its\r\nown \"daily\" says is a \"City of marvellous wonder and magic growth,\" &c.,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham Begging.~--Liberal to others as a rule when in distress, it\r\nis on record that once at least the inhabitants of this town were the\r\nrecipients of like favours at the hands of their fellow-countrymen. In\r\nthe churchwardens' books of Redenall, Norfolk, under date September 20,\r\n1644, is an entry of 6s. paid \"to Richard Herbert, of Birmingham, where\r\nwas an hundred fifty and five dwelling house burnt by Pr. Rupert.\"\r\n\r\n~Birmingham Borough,~ which is in the hundred of Hemlingford, and wholly\r\nin the county of Warwick, includes the parish of Birmingham, part of the\r\nparish of Edgbaston, and the hamlets of Deritend-and-Bordesley, and\r\nDuddeston-cum-Nechells, in the parish of Aston. The extreme length is\r\nsix miles one furlong, the average breadth three miles, the\r\ncircumference twenty-one miles, and the total area 8,420 acres, viz.,\r\nBirmingham, 2,955; in Edgbaston, 2,512; and in Aston, 2,853. Divided\r\ninto sixteen wards by an Order in Council, approved by Her Majesty,\r\nOctober 15, 1872. The mean level of Birmingham is reckoned as 443 feet\r\nabove sea level.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham Heath.~--Once an unenclosed common, and part of it may now\r\nbe said to be common property, nearly 100 acres of it being covered with\r\npublic buildings for the use of such as need a common home. There is\r\nnot, however, anything commonplace in the style of these erections for\r\nsheltering our common infirmities, as the Workhouse, Gaol, and Asylum\r\ncombined have cost \"the Commons\" something like £350,000. The Volunteers\r\nin 1798 made use of part of the Heath as a practice and parade ground.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham Bishops.~--The Rev. John Milner, a Catholic divine and\r\neminent ecclesiastical antiquary, who was educated at Edgbaston, was\r\nappointed Bishop Apostolic in the Midland district, with the title of\r\n\"Bishop of Castaballa.\" He died in 1826, in his 74th year.--Dr.\r\nUllathorne was enthroned at St. Chad's, August 30th, 1848, as Bishop of\r\nthe present Catholic diocese.--The Rev. P. Lee, Head Master of Free\r\nGrammar School in 1839, was chosen as the first Bishop of Manchester.--\r\nThe Rev. S. Thornton, St. George's, was consecrated Bishop of Ballarat,\r\nMay 1, 1875.--The Rev. Edward White Benson, D.D., a native of this town,\r\nwas nominated first Bishop of Truro, in December, 1876, and is now\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury.--The Rev. Thomas Huband Gregg resigned the\r\nvicarage of East Harborne in March, 1877, and on June 20 was consecrated\r\nat New York a Bishop of the Reformed Episcopal Church.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham~ (~Little~).--In a record of the early date of 1313 there is\r\nmention of a place called Little Birmingham (parvam Birmingham), as\r\nbeing in the hundreds of North and South Erpyngham, Norfolk.\r\n\r\n~Birmingham in the Future.~--It has been proposed that the Borough\r\nshould be extended so as to include the Local Board districts of\r\nHarborne and Handsworth, Balsall Heath, Moseley, King's Heath, part of\r\nKing's Norton parish, the whole of Yardley and Acock's Green, part of\r\nNorthfield parish, all Aston Manor, Saltley, Witton, Little Bromwich,\r\nand Erdington, covering an area of about 32,000 acres, with a present\r\npopulation of over half a million.\r\n\r\n~Blind Asylum.~--See \"_Philanthropic Institutions_.\"\r\n\r\n~Blondin~ made his first appearance at Aston Park, June 8, 1861; at the\r\nBirmingham Concert Hall, December, 1869, and March, 1870; at the\r\nReservoir September, 1873, and September, 1878. Mrs. Powell, who was\r\nknown as the \"Female Blondin,\" was killed at a fête in Aston Park, July\r\n20, 1868, by falling from the high rope.\r\n\r\n~Bloomsbury Institute.~--Opened in 1860. The memorial stones of the\r\nlecture-hall in Bloomsbury Street were laid August 6, 1877, the £750\r\ncost being given by Mr. David Smith. Seats 500.\r\n\r\n~Blue Coat School.~--See \"_Schools_.\"\r\n\r\n~Blues.~--The United Society of True Blues was founded in 1805 by a\r\nnumber of old Blue Coat boys (formerly known as \"The Grateful Society\")\r\nwho joined in raising an annual subscription for the School.\r\n\r\n~Board Schools.~--See \"_School Board_.\"\r\n\r\n~Boatmen's Hall,~ erected on Worcester Wharf, by Miss Ryland, was opened\r\nMarch 17, 1879.\r\n\r\n~Bonded Warehouses.~--Our Chamber of Commerce memoralised the Lords of\r\nthe Treasury for the extension of the bonded warehouse system to this\r\ntown, in December, 1858, but it was several years before permission was\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n~Books.~--The oldest known Birmingham book is a \"Latin Grammar, composed\r\nin the English tongue,\" printed in London in 1652, for Thomas Underhill,\r\nits author having been one of the masters of our Free School.\r\n\r\n~Book Club (The).~--Commenced some few years previous to 1775, at which\r\ntime its meetings were held in Poet Freeth's, Leicester Arms,\r\nBell-street. As its name implies, the club was formed for the purchase\r\nand circulation among the members of new or choice books, which were\r\nsold at the annual dinner, hence the poet's hint in one of his\r\ninvitations to these meetings:--\r\n\r\n  \"Due regard let the hammer be paid,\r\n    Ply the glass gloomy care to dispel;\r\n  If mellow our hearts are all made,\r\n    The books much better may sell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these days of cheap literature, free libraries, and halfpenny papers,\r\nsuch a club is not wanted.\r\n\r\n~Books on Birmingham.~--Notes of Birmingham were now and then given\r\nbefore the days of that dear old antiquary Hutton, but _his_ \"History\"\r\nmust always take rank as the first. Morfitt's was amusing as far as it\r\nwent; Bissett's was ditto and pictorial; but it remained till the\r\npresent period for really reliable sketches to be given. The best are\r\nLangford's \"Century of Birmingham Life,\" Harman's \"Book of Dates,\"\r\nDent's \"Old and New Birmingham,\" Bunce's \"Municipal History,\" and the\r\nlast is \"Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham.\"\r\n\r\n~Botanical Gardens.~--See \"_Horticultural Societies_.\"\r\n\r\n~Borough Members.~--See \"_Parliamentary Elections_.\"\r\n\r\n~Boulton (Mathew).~--The son of a hardware manufacturer of the same\r\nname, was born here on September 3, 1728 (old style) and received his\r\neducation principally at the academy of the Rev. Mr. Anstey, Deritend.\r\nHe is accredited with having at the early age of seventeen invented the\r\ninlaying of steel buckles, buttons and trinkets, which for many years\r\nwere in great request. These articles at first were exported to France\r\nin large quantities, being afterwards brought from thence and sold in\r\nLondon as the latest Parisian fashion. In 1762 (his father having left\r\nhim a considerable property) Mr. Boulton leased a quantity of the land\r\nthen forming part of Birmingham Heath, where at a cost of over £10,000\r\nhe erected the famous Soho Works, and later on (in 1794) he purchased\r\nthe freehold of that and a considerable tract of the adjoining land. In\r\n1767 steam was first brought into use to supplement the power derived\r\nfrom the water wheels, and in 1769 he became acquainted with James Watt,\r\nwith whom he afterwards went into partnership to make steam engines of\r\nall kinds, sinking £47,000 before he had any return for his money. Mr.\r\nBoulton lived to the patriarchal age of fourscore and one, leaving this\r\nlife on August 7, 1809. He was buried at Handsworth, 600 workmen,\r\nbesides numberless friends, following his remains; all of whom were\r\npresented with hatbands and gloves and a silver medal, and regaled with\r\na dinner, the funeral costing altogether about £2,000.--See \"_Coinage_,\"\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n~Bourne College,~ erected by the Primitive Methodists and their friends,\r\nat Quinton, at a cost of nearly £10,00, was formally opened on October\r\n240 [Transcriber's note: as original] 1882. When completed there will be\r\naccommodation for 120 students.\r\n\r\n~Bowling Greens.~--These seem to have been favourite places of resort\r\nwith our grandfathers and great-grandfathers. The completion of one at\r\nthe Union Tavern, Cherry Street, was announced March 26, 1792, but we\r\nread of another as attached to the Hen and Chickens, in High Street, as\r\nearly as 1741. There is a very fine bowling-green at Aston Hall, and\r\nlovers of the old-fashioned game can be also accommodated at Cannon Hill\r\nPark, and at several suburban hotels.\r\n\r\n~Boys' Refuge~ is at corner of Bradford Street and Alcester Street, and\r\nthe Secretary will be glad of help.\r\n\r\n~Boyton.~--Captain Boyton showed his life-preserving dress, at the\r\nReservoir, April 24, 1875.\r\n\r\n~Bracebridge.~--A very ancient family, long connected with this\r\nneighbourhood, for we read of Peter de Bracebrigg who married a\r\ngrand-daughter of the Earl of Warwick in A.D. 1100, and through her\r\ninherited Kingsbury, an ancient residence of the Kings of Mercia. In\r\nlater days the Bracebridges became more intimately connected with this\r\ntown by the marriage in 1775 of Abraham Bracebridge, Esq., of\r\nAtherstone, with Mary Elizabeth, the only child and heiress of Sir\r\nCharles Holte, to whom the Aston estates ultimately reverted. Many\r\narticles connected with the Holte family have been presented to\r\nBirmingham by the descendants of this marriage.\r\n\r\n~Bradford Street~ takes its name from Henry Bradford, who, in 1767,\r\nadvertised that he would give a freehold site to any man who would build\r\nthe first house therein.\r\n\r\n~Breweries.~--In the days of old nearly every publican and innkeeper was\r\nhis own brewer, the fame of his house depending almost solely on the\r\nquality of the \"stingo\" he could pour out to his customers. The first\r\nlocal brewery on a large scale appears to have been that erected in\r\nMoseley Street in 1782, which even down to late years retained its\r\ncognomen of the Birmingham Old Brewery. In 1817 another company opened a\r\nsimilar extensive establishment at St. Peter's Place, in Broad Street,\r\nand since then a number of enterprising individuals have at times\r\nstarted in the same track, but most have come grief, even in the case of\r\nthose whose capital was not classed under the modern term \"limited.\" The\r\nprincipal local breweries now in existence are those of Messrs. Holder,\r\nMitchell, and Bates, in addition to the well-known Crosswells Brewery of\r\nMessrs Walter Showell and Sons, noted in next paragraph. The principal\r\nVinegar Brewery in Birmingham is that of Messrs. Fardon and Co.\r\n(Limited), in Glover Street, which was formed in 1860, and is well\r\nworthy of the stranger's visit. The annual output is about 850,000\r\ngallons, there being storage for nearly a million gallons, and 36,000\r\ncasks to send the vinegar out in.\r\n\r\n~Brewery at Crosswells.~--Though by far the most extensive brewery\r\nsupplying Birmingham, the Crosswells cannot claim to be more than in the\r\ninfancy of its establishment at present, as only twelve years ago the\r\nmany acres of ground now covered by its buildings formed but part of an\r\nunenclosed piece of waste land. Nevertheless, the spot was well-known\r\nand often visited in ancient times, on account of the wonderful and\r\nmiraculous cures said to have been effected by the free use of the water\r\ngushing up from the depths of the springs to be found there, and which\r\nthe monks of old had christened \"The Wells of the Cross.\" Be its\r\nmedicinal qualities what they might in the days before Harry the Eighth\r\nwas king, the Cross Wells water retained its name and fame for centuries\r\nafter the monks were banished and the burly king who drove them out had\r\nhimself turned to dust. It has always been acknowledged as one of the\r\npurest waters to be found in the kingdom; but its peculiar and special\r\nadaptability to the brewing of \"good old English cheer\" was left to be\r\ndiscovered by the founder of the firm of Messrs. Walter Showell and\r\nSons, who, as stated before, some twelve years back, erected the nucleus\r\nof the present extensive brewery. Starting with the sale of only a few\r\nhundred barrels per week, the call for their ales soon forced the\r\nproprietors to extend their premises in order that supply should meet\r\ndemand. At first doubled, then quadrupled, the brewery is now at least\r\nten times its original size; and a slight notion of the business carried\r\non may be gathered from the fact that the firm's stock of barrels tots\r\nup to nearly 60,000 and is being continually increased, extensive\r\ncooperages, blacksmiths' shops, &c., being attached to the brewery, as\r\nwell as malthouses, offices, and storehouses of all kinds. The head\r\noffices of the firm, which are connected by telephone with the brewery,\r\nas well as with the stores at Kingston Buildings, Crescent Wharf, are\r\nsituated in Great Charles Street, and thus the Crosswells Brewery\r\n(though really at Langley Green, some half-dozen miles away as the crow\r\nflies) becomes entitled to rank as a Birmingham establishment, and\r\ncertainly not one of the least, inasmuch as the weekly sale of\r\nCrosswells ales for this town alone is more than 80,000 gallons per\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n~Brickkiln Lane,~ now called the Horse Fair, gives its own derivation.\r\n\r\n~Bright.~--The Right Hon. John Bright, though not a Birmingham man, nor\r\nconnected with the town by any ties of personal interest or business,\r\nhas for the last quarter-century been the leading member returned to\r\nParliament as representing the borough, and must always rank foremost\r\namong our men of note. Mr. Bright is the son of the late Jacob Bright,\r\nof Greenbank, near Rochdale, and was born November 16, 1811. He and his\r\nbrother, Mr. Jacob Bright, M.P. for Manchester, began business as\r\npartners in the affiliated firms of John Bright and Brothers, cotton\r\nspinners and manufacturers, Rochdale, and Bright and Co., carpet\r\nmanufacturers, Rochdale and Manchester. At an early age Mr. Bright\r\nshowed a keen interest in politics, and took part in the Reform\r\nagitation of 1831-32. In those days every householder was compelled by\r\nlaw to pay the Church-rates levied in his parish, whatever his religious\r\ncreed might be, and it is said that Mr. Bright's first flights of\r\noratory were delivered from a tombstone in Rochdale church-yard in\r\nindignant denunciation of a tax which to him, as a member of the Society\r\nof Friends, appeared especially odious. It was not, however, till 1839,\r\nwhen he joined the Anti-Corn Law League, that Mr. Bright's reputation\r\nspread beyond his own immediate neighbourhood; and there can be no doubt\r\nbut that his fervid addresses, coupled with the calmer and more logical\r\nspeeches of Mr. Cobden, contributed in an appreciable degree to the\r\nsuccess of the movement. In July, 1843, he was returned as M.P. for the\r\ncity of Durham, which he represented until the general election of 1847,\r\nwhen he was the chosen of Manchester. For ten years he was Manchester's\r\nman in everything, but the side he took in regard to the Russian war was\r\nso much at variance with the popular opinions of his constituents that\r\nthey at last turned on him, burnt his effigy in the streets, and threw\r\nhim out at the general election in March, 1857. At the death of Mr. G.F.\r\nMuntz, in July following, Mr. Bright was almost unanimously selected to\r\nfill his place as M.P. for this town, and for 25 years he has continued\r\nto honour Birmingham by permitting us to call him _our_ member. (See\r\n\"_Parliamentary Elections_.\") Mr. Bright has been twice married, but is\r\nnow a widower, and he has twice held office in the Cabinet, first as\r\nPresident of the Board Of Trade, and more lately as Chancellor of the\r\nDuchy of Lancaster.\r\n\r\n~Bristol Road.~--Trees were first planted in this road in the spring of\r\n1853.\r\n\r\n~Britannia Metal.~--A mixed metal formed of 90 parts of tin, 2 copper,\r\nand 8 antimony, brought into use about 1790, and long a favourite with\r\nmanufacturers and public alike. The introduction of electroplating did\r\nmuch towards its extended make at first, but latterly it has been in\r\ngreat measure, replaced by German silver and other alloys.\r\n\r\n~British Association~ for the Advancement, of Science first met in this\r\ntown Aug. 26, 1839. They were here again Oct. 12, 1857, and Sep. 6,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n~Brittle Street~ formerly ran from Livery Street to Snow Hill, about the\r\nspot where now the entrance gates to the Station are.\r\n\r\n~Broad Street.~--150 years ago part of what is now known as Dale End was\r\ncalled Broad Street, the present thoroughfare of that name then being\r\nonly a pathway through the fields.\r\n\r\n~Brunswick Buildings.~--Erected in New Street, by Mr. Samuel Haines in\r\n1854. A funny tale has been told about the original lease, which\r\nincluded a covenant that at the expiration of the term of 100 years for\r\nwhich it was granted, the land was to be delivered up to the Grammar\r\nSchool \"well cropped with potatoes.\" In 1760 New Street _was_ a new\r\nstreet indeed, for there were but a few cottages with gardens there\r\nthen, and the potatoe proviso was no doubt thought a capital provision;\r\nbut fancy growing that choice edibie there in 1860!\r\n\r\n~Buck.~--Henry Buck, P.G.M., and Sec. of the Birmingham district of the\r\nManchester Order of Oddfellows for twenty-five years, died Jan. 22,\r\n1876, aged 63. A granite obelisk to his memory in St. Philip's\r\nchurchyard was unveiled Sep. 17, 1877.\r\n\r\n~Building Societies~ took early root here, as we find there were several\r\nin 1781.--See \"_Friendly Societies_.\"\r\n\r\n~Buckles~ were worn as shoe fasteners in the reign of Charles II.--See\r\n\"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Buttons.~--Some interesting notes respecting the manufacture of buttons\r\nwill be found under the head of \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Bulgarian Atrocities, 1876-7.~--A considerable amount of \"political\r\ncapital\" was made out of these occurrences, but only £1,400 was\r\nsubscribed here for the relief of the unfortunates; while merely £540\r\ncould be raised towards helping the thousands of poor Bosnian refugees\r\ndriven from their homes by the Russians in 1878, and of this sum £200\r\nwas given by one person.\r\n\r\n~Bullbaiting~ was prohibited in 1773 by Order in Council, and an Act was\r\npassed in 1835, to put a stop to all baiting of bulls, badgers, and\r\nbears. At Chapel Wake, 1798, some law-defying reprobates started a\r\nbullbaiting on Snow Hill, but the Loyal Association of Volunteers turned\r\nout, and with drums beating and colours flying soon put the rebels to\r\nflight, pursuing them as far as Birmingham Heath, where the baiters got\r\na beating, the Loyals returning home in triumph with the bull as a\r\ntrophy. The last time this \"sport\" was indulged in in this neighbourhood\r\nappears to have been early in October, 1838, at Gib Heath, better known\r\nnow as Nineveh Road.\r\n\r\n~Bull Lane~ was the name once given to that part of the present Colmore\r\nRow between Livery Street and Snow Hill, though it has been better known\r\nas Monmouth Street.\r\n\r\n~Bull Street.~--Once called Chapel Street, as leading to the chapel of\r\nthe ancient Priory; afterwards named from the old inn known as the Red\r\nBull (No. 83).\r\n\r\n~Burial Grounds.~--See \"_Cemeteries_.\"\r\n\r\n~Burns.~--Excisemen, when Robert Burns was one of them, were wont to\r\ncarry pistols, and those the poet had were given him by one of our\r\ngunmakers, Mr. Blair. They were afterwards bought by Allan Cunningham,\r\nwho gave them back to Burns' widow.--Birmingham lent its rill to the\r\ngreat river of homage to the genius of Burns which flowed through the\r\nlength and breadth of the civilised world on the occasion of the Burns'\r\ncentenary in January, 1859. The most interesting of the three or four\r\nmeetings held here was one of a semi-private nature, which took place at\r\nAston Hall, and which originated, not with Scotchmen, but with\r\nEnglishmen. Some forty-five or fifty gentlemen, only some half-dozen of\r\nwhom were Scotch, sat down to an excellent supper in the fine old room\r\nin which the Queen lunched the previous year. The chairman was Mr.\r\nSamuel Timmins, and the vice-chairman was Mr. Ross.\r\n\r\n~Cabs, Cars, and Carriages.~--The hackney carriages, or four-wheelers,\r\nof this town, have the credit of being superior to those used in London,\r\nthough the hansoms (notwithstanding their being the inventions of one\r\nwho should rank almost as a local worthy--the architect of our Town\r\nHall) are not up to the mark. Prior to 1820 there were no regular stands\r\nfor vehicles plying for hire, those in New Street, Bull Street, and\r\nColmore Row being laid in that year, the first cabman's license being\r\ndated June 11. The first \"Cabman's Rest\" was opened in Ratcliffe Place,\r\nJune 13, 1872, the cost (£65) being gathered by the cabman's friend, the\r\nRev. Micarah Hill, who also, in 1875, helped them to start an\r\nassociation for mutual assistance in cases of sickness or death. There\r\nare sixteen of these \"shelters\" in the town, the cabmen subscribing\r\nabout £200 yearly towards expenses. As a rule, the Birmingham cabmen are\r\na civil and obliging body of men, though now and then a little sharp\r\npractice may occur, as in the instance of the stranger who, arriving in\r\nNew Street Station one evening last summer, desired to be taken to the\r\nQueen's Hotel. His luggage being properly secured, and himself safely\r\nensconced, Mr. Cabby cooly took the rug from his horse's back, mounted\r\nhis seat and walked the animal through the gates back to the building\r\nthe stranger had just left, depositing his fare, and as calmly holding\r\nout his hand for the customary shilling as if he had driven the full\r\ndistance of a mile and a half. The fares laid down by the bye-laws as\r\nproper to be charged within the Borough, and within five miles from the\r\nstatue in Stephenson Place, in the Borough, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_By time_, the driver driving at a rate not less than five miles per\r\nhour, if so required:--\r\n\r\n                                           s. d.\r\n  For every carriage constructed to\r\n   carry four persons, for the first\r\n   hour, or part of hour  ..   ..          3  0\r\n  For every additional 15 minutes, or\r\n   part of 15 minutes.    ..   ..          0  2\r\n  For every carriage constructed to\r\n   carry two persons, for the first\r\n   hour, or part of hour  ..   ..          2  6\r\n  For every additional 15 minutes, or\r\n   part of 15 minutes..   ..   ..          0  6\r\n  Any person hiring any carriage\r\n   otherwise than by time is entitled\r\n   to detain the same five minutes\r\n   without extra charge, but for\r\n   every 15 minutes, or part thereof,\r\n   over the first five minutes, the\r\n   hirer must pay    ..   ..   ..          0  6\r\n  _By distance_:--\r\n  Cabs or Cars to carry 2 persons not\r\n   exceeding 1-1/2 miles  ..   ..          1  0\r\n  Per 1/2 mile after ..   ..   ..          0  4\r\n  One horse vehicles to carry 4\r\n   persons, not exceeding 1 mile ..        1  0\r\n  For any further distance, per 1/2 mile\r\n   after ..  ..  ..  ..   ..   ..          0  6\r\n  Cars or Carriages with 2 horses, to\r\n   carry 4 persons, not exceeding 1\r\n   mile  ..  ..  ..  ..   ..   ..          1  9\r\n  Per 1/2 mile after ..   ..   ..          0  9\r\n  _Double Fares_ shall be allowed and\r\n   paid for every fare, or so much of\r\n   any fare as may be performed by\r\n   any carriage after 12 o'clock at\r\n   night, and before 6 in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Calthorpe Park,~ Pershore road, has an area of 3la. 1r. 13p., and was\r\ngiven to the town in 1857 by Lord Calthorpe. Though never legally\r\nconveyed to the Corporation, the Park is held under a grant from the\r\nCalthorpe family, the effect of which is equivalent to a conveyance in\r\nfee. The Duke of Cambridge performed the opening ceremony in this our\r\nfirst public park.\r\n\r\n~Calthorpe Road~ was laid out for building in the year 1818, and the\r\nfact is worthy of note as being the commencement of our local West End.\r\n\r\n~Calico, Cotton, and Cloth.~--In 1702 the printing or wearing of printed\r\ncalicoes was prohibited, and more strictly so in 1721, when cloth\r\nbuttons and buttonholes were also forbidden. Fifty years after, the\r\nrequisites for manufacturing cotton or cotton cloth were now allowed to\r\nbe exported, and in 1785 a duty was imposed on all cotton goods brought\r\ninto the Kingdom. Strange as it may now appear, there was once a\r\n\"cotton-spinning mill\" in Birmingham. The first thread of cotton ever\r\nspun by rollers was produced in a small house near Sutton Coldfield as\r\nearly as the year 1700, and in 1741 the inventor, John Wyatt, had a mill\r\nin the Upper Priory, where his machine, containing fifty rollers, was\r\nturned by two donkeys walking round an axis, like a horse in a modern\r\nclay mill. The manufacture, however, did not succeed in this town,\r\nthough carried on more or less till the close of the century, Paul's\r\nmachine being advertised for sale April 29, 1795. The Friends'\r\nschoolroom now covers the site of the cotton mill.\r\n\r\n~Canals.~--The first Act for the construction of the \"cut\" or canal in\r\nconnection with Birmingham was passed in 1761, that to Bilston being\r\ncommenced in 1767. The delivery here of the first boat-load of coals\r\n(Nov. 6, 1769) was hailed, and rightly so, as one of the greatest\r\nblessings that could be conferred on the town, the immediate effect\r\nbeing a reduction in the price to 6d per cwt, which in the following May\r\ncame down to 4d. The cutting of the first sod towards making the Grand\r\nJunction Canal took place July 26, 1766, and it was completed in 1790.\r\nIn 1768 Briudley, the celebrated engineer, planned out the Birmingham\r\nand Wolverhampton Canal, proposing to make it 22 miles long; but he did\r\nnot live to see it finished. The work was taken up by Smeaton and\r\nTelford; the latter of whom calling it \"a crooked ditch\" struck out a\r\nstraight cut, reducing the length to 14 miles, increasing the width to\r\n40 feet, the bridges having each a span of 52 feet. The \"Summit\" bridge\r\nwas finished in 1879. The Fazeley Canal was completed in 1783, and so\r\nsuccessfully was it worked that in nine years the shares were at a\r\npremium of £1170. In 1785 the Birmingham, the Fazeley, and the Grand\r\nJunction Companies took up and completed an extension to Coventry. The\r\nBirmingham and Worcester Canal was commenced in 1,791, the cost being a\r\nlittle over £600,000, and it was opened for through traffic July 21,\r\n1815. By an agreement of September 18, 1873, this canal was sold to the\r\nGloucester and Berkeley Canal Co. (otherwise the Sharpness Dock Co.),\r\nand has thus lost its distinctive local name. The Birmingham and Warwick\r\ncommenced in 1793; was finished in 1800. Communication with Liverpool by\r\nwater was complete in 1826, the carriage of goods thereto which had\r\npreviously cost £5 per ton, being reduced to 30s. For a through cut to\r\nLondon, a company was started in May, 1836, with a nominal capital of\r\n£3,000,000, in £100 shares, and the first cargoes were despatched in\r\nAugust, 1840. In April, 1840, an Act was passed to unite the Wyrley and\r\nEssington Canal Co. with the Birmingham Canal Co., leading to the\r\nextension, at a cost of over £120,000, of the canal system to the lower\r\nside of the town. There are 2,800 miles of canals in England, and about\r\n300 miles in Ireland. The total length of what may properly be called\r\nBirmingham canals is about 130 miles, but if the branches in the \"Black\r\nCountry\" be added thereto, it will reach to near 250 miles. The first\r\niron boat made its appearance on canal waters July 24, 1787; the first\r\npropelled by steam arrived here from London, September 29, 1826. The\r\nadaptation of steam power to general canal traffic, however, was not\r\ncarried to any great extent, on account of the injury caused to the\r\nbanks by the \"wash\" from the paddles and screws, though, when railways\r\nwere first talked about, the possibility of an inland steam navigation\r\nwas much canvassed. When the Bill for the London and Birmingham Railway\r\nwas before Parliament, in 1833, some enterprising carriers started (on\r\nMidsummer-day) an opposition in the shape of a stage-boat, to run daily\r\nand do the distance, with goods and passengers, in 16 hours. The\r\nBirmingham and Liverpool Canal Company introduced steam tugs in 1843. On\r\nSaturday, November 11, they despatched 16 boats, with an aggregate load\r\nof 380 tons, to Liverpool, drawn by one small vessel of 16-horse power,\r\nother engines taking up the \"train\" at different parts of the voyage.\r\nMr. Inshaw, in 1853, built a steamboat for canals with a screw on each\r\nside of the rudder. It was made to draw four boats with 40 tons of coal\r\nin each at two and a half miles per hour, and the twin screws were to\r\nnegative the surge, but the iron horses of the rail soon put down, not\r\nonly all such weak attempts at competition, but almost the whole canal\r\ntraffic itself, so far as general merchandise and carriage of light\r\ngoods and parcels was concerned. \"Flyboats\" for passengers at one time\r\nran a close race with the coaches and omnibuses between here,\r\nWolverhampton, and other places, but they are old people now who can\r\nrecollect travelling in that manner in their youth.\r\n\r\n~Canal Accidents.~--The banks of the Birmingham and Worcester Canal,\r\nnear Wheeley's Road, gave way on May 26, 1872, causing considerable\r\ndamage to the properties near at hand. A similar occurrence took place\r\nat Aston, July 20, 1875; and a third happened at Solihull Lodge Valley,\r\nOctober 27, 1880, when about 80ft. of an embankment 30-ft. high\r\ncollapsed.\r\n\r\n~Canal Reservoir,~ better known as \"The Reservoir,\" near Monument Lane,\r\na popular place of resort, covers an area of 62A. 1R. 5P., and is\r\nthree-quarters of a mile long. Visitors and others fond of boating can\r\nbe accommodated here to their heart's content.\r\n\r\n~Cannon.~--The first appearance of these instruments of destruction in\r\nconnection with the English army was in the time of Edward III. in his\r\nwars with the Scotch and the French, the first great battle of\r\nhistorical note in which they were used being that of Cressy, in 1346.\r\nThe manufacture of \"small arms,\" as they are called, has been anything\r\nbut a small feature in the trade history of our past, but\r\ncannon-founding does not appear to have been much carried on, though a\r\nlocal newspaper of 1836 mentioned that several 250 and 300-pounder guns\r\nwere sent from here in that year for the fortifications on the\r\nDardanelles.\r\n\r\n~Cannon Hill Park~ covers an area of 57a. 1r. 9p., and was presented to\r\nthe town by Miss Ryland, the deed of conveyance bearing date April 18th,\r\n1873. The nearest route to this Park is by way of Pershore Road and\r\nEdgbaston Lane, omnibuses going that way every half-hour.\r\n\r\n~Caps.~--The inventor of percussion caps is not known, but we read of\r\nthem as being made here as early as 1816, though they were not\r\nintroduced into \"the service\" until 1839. The manufacture of these\r\narticles has several times led to great loss of life among the workers,\r\nnotes of which will be found under the head of \"_Explosions_.\" See also\r\n\"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Carlyle.~--The celebrated philosopher, Thomas Carlyle, resided here for\r\na short time in 1824; and his notes about Birmingham cannot but be worth\r\npreserving. Writing to his brother John under date Aug. 10, he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Birmingham I have now tried for a reasonable time, and I cannot\r\n  complain of being tired of it. As a town it is pitiful enough--a mean\r\n  congeries of bricks, including one or two large capitalists, some\r\n  hundreds of minor ones, and, perhaps, a hundred and twenty thousand\r\n  sooty artisans in metals and chemical produce. The streets are\r\n  ill-built, ill-paved, always flimsy in their aspect--often poor,\r\n  sometimes miserable. Not above one or two of them are paved with\r\n  flagstones at the sides; and to walk upon the little egg-shaped,\r\n  slippery flints that supply their places is something like a penance.\r\n  Yet withal it is interesting for some of the commons or lanes that\r\n  spot and intersect the green, woody, undulating environs to view this\r\n  city of Tubal Cain. Torrents of thick smoke, with ever and anon a\r\n  burst of dingy flame, are issuing from a thousand funnels. 'A thousand\r\n  hammers fall by turns.' You hear the clank of innumerable steam\r\n  engines, the rumbling of cars and vans, and the hum of men interrupted\r\n  by the sharper rattle of some canal boat loading or disloading, or,\r\n  perhaps, some fierce explosion when the cannon founders [qy: the\r\n  proof-house] are proving their new-made ware. I have seen their\r\n  rolling-mills, their polishing of teapots, and buttons and\r\n  gun-barrels, and lire-shovels, and swords, and all manner of toys and\r\n  tackle. I have looked into their ironworks where 150,000 men are\r\n  smelting the metal in a district a few miles to the north: their coal\r\n  mines, fit image, of Arvenus; their tubes and vats, as large as\r\n  country churches, full of copperas and aqua fortis and oil of vitroil;\r\n  and the whole is not without its attractions, as well as repulsions,\r\n  of which, when we meet, I will preach to you at large.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Carr's Lane.~--Originally this is believed to have been known as\r\n\"Goddes Cart Lane,\" and was sufficiently steep to be dangerous, as\r\nevidenced by accidents noted in past history.\r\n\r\n~Carr's Lane Chapel,~ the meeting house of the old Independents, or as\r\nthey are now called, the Congregationalists, will be noticed under\r\n\"_Places of Worship_.\"\r\n\r\n~Cartoons.~--If some of our fore-fathers could but glance at the\r\nillustrations or the portait caricatures of local public men and their\r\ndoings, now given us almost daily, we fear they would not credit us\r\nmoderns with much advancement in the way of political politeness,\r\nhowever forward we may be in other respects. Many really good cartoons\r\n_have_ appeared, and neither side can be said to hold a monopoly of such\r\nsketchy skilfulness, but one of the best (because most truthful) was the\r\ncartoon issued in October 1868, giving the portrait of a\r\n\"Vote-as-you're-told\" electer, led by the nose by his _Daily Post_.\r\n\r\n~Castle.~--Birmingham Castle is named in an ancient document as being\r\nsituated a \"bowshot southwestward of the church,\" but the exact site\r\nthereof has never been traced. It is supposed to have been erected about\r\nthe year 1140, and to have been demolished by order of King Stephen, in\r\n1176.\r\n\r\n~Castle Street~ takes its name from the hostlery once so famous among\r\nour coach officers.\r\n\r\n~Catacombs.~--There is a large number of massively-built stone vaults\r\nunderneath Christ Church, each divided into tiers of catacombs, or\r\nreceptacles for the dead. It is in one of these that the remains of\r\nBaskerville at last found a resting place.--The catacombs at the General\r\nCemetery are many, being cut out of the sandstone rock known as Key\r\nHill, and a large number have been and can be excavated underneath the\r\nchurch in the Warstone Lane Cemetery.\r\n\r\n~Cathedral.~--See \"_Places of Warship--Catholic_.\"\r\n\r\n~Cat Shows.~--The first Cat Show held here was opened November 29th,\r\n1873, and was a very successful speculation; but the exhibitions of the\r\ntwo following years did not pay and since then the grimalkins have been\r\nleft at home.\r\n\r\n~Cattle Show.~--As first started (in 1849, when it was held near Kent\r\nStreet), and at Bingley Hall in the following year, this was an annual\r\nshow of cattle, sheep, and pigs only, but after years has made it a\r\ngathering place for specimens, of nearly everything required on a farm,\r\nand the \"Show\" has become an \"_Exhibition_,\" under which heading full\r\nnotice will be found.\r\n\r\n~Cemeteries.~--The burial grounds attached to the Churches were formerly\r\nthe only places of interment save for suicides and murderers--the former\r\nof whom were buried at some cross-road, with a stake driven through the\r\nbody, while the latter were frequently hung in chains and got no burial\r\nat all. In 1807 the first addendum to our churchyards was made by the\r\npurchase of 13,192 square yards of land in Park Street, which cost\r\n£1,600. Having been laid out and enclosed with substantial railed walls\r\nat a further outlay of £764, the ground was duly consecrated July 16,\r\n1813, and for some years was the chief receptacle for decaying humanity\r\nof all classes, many thousands of whom were there deposited. By degrees\r\nthe ground came to be looked upon as only fit for the poorest of the\r\npoor, until, after being divided by the railway, this \"God's Acre\" was\r\ncared fir by none, and was well called the \"black spot\" of the town.\r\nSince the passing of the Closed Burial Grounds Bill (March 18, 1878) the\r\nCorporations have taken possession, and at considerable expense have\r\nre-walled the enclosure and laid it out as a place of health resort for\r\nthe children of the neighbourhood. The burial grounds of St.\r\nBartholomew's, St. Martin's, St. Mary's, and St. George's have also been\r\ncarefully and tastefully improved in appearance, and we can now venture\r\nto look at most of our churchyards without shame.\r\n\r\nThe General Cemetery at Key Hill was originated at a meeting held Oct.\r\n18, 1832, when a proprietary Company was formed, and a capital fixed at\r\n£12,000, in shares of £10 each. The total area of the property is about\r\ntwelve acres, eight of which are laid out for general burials, in a\r\nedition to the catacombs cut into the sandstone rock.\r\n\r\nThe Church of England Cemetery in Warstone Lane is also the property of\r\na private Company, having a capital of £20,000 in £10 shares. The area\r\nis nearly fifteen acres, the whole of which was consecrated as a burial\r\nground for the Church on August 20, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Cemetery of St. Joseph, at Nechell's Green, received its\r\nfirst consignment in 1850.\r\n\r\nThe introduction and extension of railways have played sad havoc with a\r\nnumber of the old burial grounds belonging to our forefathers. As\r\nmentioned above the London and North Western took a slice out of Park\r\nStreet Cemetery. The Great Western cleared the Quakers' burial ground in\r\nMonmouth Street (where the Arcade now stands) the remains of the\r\ndeparted Friends being removed to their chapel yard in Bull Street, and\r\na curious tale has been told in connection therewith. It is said that\r\nthe representative of the Society of Friends was a proper man of\r\nbusiness, as, indeed, most of them are, and that he drove rather a hard\r\nbargain with the railway directors, who at last were obliged to give in\r\nto what they considered to be an exorbitant demand for such a small bit\r\nof freehold. The agreement was made and the contract signed, and Friend\r\nBroadbrim went on his way rejoicing; but not for long. In selling the\r\nland he apparently forgot that the land contained bones, for when the\r\nquestion of removing the dead was mooted, the Quaker found he had to pay\r\nback a goodly portion of the purchase money before he obtained\r\npermission to do so. In clearing the old streets away to make room for\r\nNew Street Station, in 1846, the London and North Western found a small\r\nJewish Cemetery in what was then known as the \"Froggery,\" but which had\r\nlong been disused. The descendants of Israel carefully gathered the\r\nbones and reinterred them in their later-dated cemetery in Granville\r\nStreet, but even here they did not find their last resting-place, for\r\nwhen, a few years back, the Midland made the West Suburban line, it\r\nbecame necessary to clear out this ground also, and the much-disturbed\r\nremains of the poor Hebrews were removed to Witton. The third and last\r\nof the Jewish Cemeteries, that in Betholom Row, which was first used in\r\nor about 1825, and has long been full, is also doomed to make way for\r\nthe extension of the same line.--During the year 1883 the time-honoured\r\nold Meeting-house yard, where Poet Freeth, and many another local\r\nworthy, were laid to rest, has been carted off--dust and ashes, tombs\r\nand tombstones--to the great graveyard at Witton, where Christian and\r\nInfidel, Jew and Gentile, it is to be hoped, will be left at peace till\r\nthe end of the world.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, the Corporation purchased 105 acres of land at Witton for the\r\nBorough Cemetery. The foundation stones of two chapels were laid August\r\n12, 1861, and the Cemetery was opened May 27, 1863, the total cost being\r\nnearly £40,000. Of the 105 acres, 53 are consecrated to the use of the\r\nChurch of England, 35 laid out for Dissenters, and 14 set aside for\r\nCatholics and Jews.\r\n\r\n~Census.~--The numbering of the people by a regular and systematic plan\r\nonce in every ten years, only came into operation in 1801, and the most\r\ninteresting returns, as connected with this town and its immediate\r\nneighbourhood, will be found under the heading of \"_Population_.\"\r\n\r\n~Centre of Birmingham.~--As defined by the authorities for the\r\nsettlement of any question of distance, Attwood's statue at the top of\r\nStephenson Place, in New Street, is reckoned as the central spot of the\r\nborough. In olden days, Nelson's monument, and prior to that, the Old\r\nCross, in the Bull Ring, was taken as the centre. As an absolute matter\r\nof fact, so far as the irregular shape of the borough area will allow of\r\nsuch a measurement being made, the central spot is covered by Messrs.\r\nHarris and Norton's warehouse in Corporation Street.\r\n\r\n~Centenarians.~--John Harman, better known as Bishop Vesey, died in\r\n1555, in his 103rd year. James Sands, who died at Harborne in 1625, was\r\nsaid to have been 140 years old, and his wife lived to be 120. Joseph\r\nStanley, of Aston, died in May, 1761, in his 106th year. Wesley, under\r\ndate of March 19, 1768, wrote of having seen George Bridgens, then in\r\nhis 107th year; Hutton, in noticing the long life of Bridgens, also\r\nmentions one John Pitt who lived to be 100, a Mrs. Moore who reached\r\n104, and an old market man who completed his 107th year. A Mr. Clarkson\r\ndied here, in February, 1733, aged 112. William Jennens, _the_ Jennens\r\nof untold, but much coveted, wealth, died in June, 1798, aged 103. John\r\nRoberts, of Digbeth, had a family of twenty-eight children, six by his\r\nthird wife, whom he married when nearly eighty, and lived to see his\r\n103rd year, in 1792, dying July 6. Thomas Taylor, a cobbler, stuck to\r\nhis last until a week of his death, July 8, 1796, at 103. T. Blakemore\r\ndied November 12, 1837, aged 105. Mrs. E. Bailey, founder of the Female\r\nCharity School, was also 105 at her death, December 2, 1854. Another old\r\nlady was Elizabeth Taylor, who died at Sparkbrook, March 5, 1864, aged\r\n104 years. Mary Hemming, of Moseley Wake Green, died December 5, 1881,\r\nin her 104th year.\r\n\r\n~Centenary Celebrations~, more or less worthy of note, are continuously\r\nrecurring, and the date of some few are here preserved. Our loyal\r\ngrandfathers honoured the hundredth, anniversary of the Revolution of\r\n1688, by a public dinner, November 4, 1788. Old Bluecoat boys in like\r\nmanner kept the centenary of their school, August 24, 1824. Admirers of\r\nthe Philosopher Priestley chose All Fools' Day, 1831, as the fitting day\r\nto celebrate the anniversary of his birth. The Centenary of the\r\nProtestant Dissenting Charity Schools was worthily celebrated by the\r\nraising of a special sum amounting to £1,305, as an addition to the\r\nfunds. In January, 1859, Robert Burns' anniversary was remembered by the\r\nholding a supper in Aston Hall, at which only half-a-dozen Scotchmen\r\nwere present out of half-a-hundred guests. The Dissenting Ministers of\r\nthis and the neighbouring counties, who, for a hundred years, have met\r\ntogether once a month, celebrated the event by a quiet luncheon-dinner,\r\nDecember 13, 1882. The Tercentenary of the Free Grammar School was\r\ncelebrated with learned speeches April 16, 1852; that of Good Queen\r\nBess, by a public prayer meeting, November 16, 1858; and that of\r\nShakespeare, April 23, 1864, by the founding of a Shakespeare Memorial\r\nLibrary. The thousandth anniversary of Alfred the Great, October 29,\r\n1849, was made much of by the Political Knowledge Association, which had\r\nnot been in existence it thousand days. The fact of John Bright being\r\nM.P. for Birmingham for a quarter of a century, was celebrated in June,\r\n1883, by the Liberal Association, who got up a \"monster\" procession in\r\nimitation of the celebrated Attwood procession of the old days of\r\nReform. The holiday was most thoroughly enjoyed by the public generally,\r\nand immense numbers of people thronged the streets to hear the bands and\r\nsee what was to be seen.\r\n\r\n~Chamberlain Memorial.~--See \"_Statues_,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Chamber of Commerce.~--In 1783 there was a \"Standing General Commercial\r\nCommittee,\" composed of the leading merchants and Manufacturers, who\r\nundertook the duty of looking after the public interests of the town\r\n(not forgetting their own peculiarly private ditto). That they were not\r\nso Liberal as their compeers of to-day may be gathered from the fact of\r\ntheir strongly opposing the exportation of brass, and on no account\r\npermitting a workman to go abroad.\r\n\r\n~Chamber of Manufacturers.~--When Pitt, in 1784, proposed to tax coal,\r\niron, copper, and other raw materials, he encountered a strong\r\nopposition from the manufacturers, prominent among whom were Boulton\r\n(Soho), Wilkinson (Bradley), and Wedgwood (Potteries), who formed a\r\n\"Chamber,\" the first meeting of which was held here in February, 1785.\r\nThe Minister was induced to alter his mind.\r\n\r\n~Chandeliers.~--Many beautiful works of art have been manufactured in\r\nthis town, which, though the wonder and admiration of strangers, receive\r\nbut faint notice here, and find no record except in the newspaper of the\r\nday or a work like the present. Among such may be ranked the superb\r\nbrass chandelier which Mr. R.W. Winfield sent to Osborne in 1853 for Her\r\nMajesty, the Queen. Designed in the Italian style, this fine specimen of\r\nthe brassworkers' skill, relieved by burnishing and light matted work,\r\nornamented with figures of Peace, Plenty, and Love in purest Parian,\r\nmasks of female faces typical of night, and otherwise decorated in the\r\nrichest manner, was declared by the late Prince Consort as the finest\r\nwork he had ever seen made in this country and worthy to rank with that\r\nof the masters of old. Not so fortunate was Mr. Collis with the\r\n\"Clarence chandelier\" and sideboard he exhibited at the Exhibition of\r\n1862. Originally made of the richest ruby cut and gilded glass for\r\nWilliam IV., it was not finished before that monarch's death, and was\r\nleft on the maker's hand. Its cost was nearly £1,000, but at the final\r\nsale of Mr. Collis's effects in Dec. 1881 it was sold for £5.\r\n\r\n~Chapels and Churches.~--See \"_Places of Worship_.\"\r\n\r\n~Charity.~--Charitable collections were made in this neighbourhood in\r\n1655, for the Redmontese Protestants, Birmingham giving £15 11s. 2d.,\r\nSutton Coldfield £14, and Aston £4 14s. 2d. On the 6th of June, 1690,\r\n£13 18s. 1-1/2d. were collected at St. Martin's \"for ye Irish\r\nProtestants.\" In 1764 some Christmas performances were given for the\r\nrelief of aged and distressed housekeepers, and the charitable custom\r\nthus inaugurated was kept up for over seventy years. In the days of\r\nmonks and monasteries, the poor and needy, the halt and lame, received\r\ncharitable doles at the hands of the former and at the gates of the\r\nlatter, but it would be questionable how far the liberality of the\r\nparsons, priests, and preachers of the present day would go were the\r\nsame system now in vogue. It has been estimated that nearly £5,000 is\r\ngiven every year in what may be called the indiscriminate charity of\r\ngiving alms to those who ask it in the streets or from door to door. By\r\nfar the largest portion of this amount goes into the hands of the\r\nundeserving and the worthless, and the formation of a central relief\r\noffice, into which the charitably-disposed may hand in their\r\ncontributions, and from whence the really poor and deserving may receive\r\nhelp in times of distress, has been a long felt want. In 1869 a \"Charity\r\nOrganisation Society\" was established here, and it is still in\r\nexistence, but it does not appear to meet with that recognised support\r\nwhich such an institution as suggested requires. In 1882 a special fund\r\nwas started for the purpose of giving aid to women left with children,\r\nand about £380 was subscribed thereto, while the ordinary income was\r\nonly £680. The special fund can hardly be said as yet to have got into\r\nworking order, but when the cost of proving the property of the\r\nrecipients, with the necessary expenses of office rent, salaries, &c.,\r\nhave been deducted from the ordinary income, the amount left to be\r\ndistributed among the persons deemed by the officials deserving of\r\nassistance is small indeed, the expenses reaching about £330 per year.\r\nIn 1880 it cost £329 18s. 4d. to give away food, cash, and clothing,\r\n&c., valued at £386 16s. 6d., an apparent anomally which would not be so\r\nglaring if the kind-hearted and charitable would only increase the\r\nincome of the Society, or re-organise it upon a wider basis.--For\r\nstatistics of poverty and the poor see \"_Pauperism_\" and \"_Poor Rates_.\"\r\n\r\n~Charitable Trusts.~--See \"_Philanthropical Institutions_,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Chartism.~--Following the great Reform movement of 1832, in which\r\nBirmingham led the van, came years of bad harvests, bad trade, and\r\nbitter distress. The great Chartist movement, though not supported by\r\nthe leaders of the local Liberal party, was taken up with a warmth\r\nalmost unequalled in any other town in the Kingdom, meetings being held\r\ndaily and nightly for months in succession, Feargus O'Connor, Henry\r\nVincent, and many other \"orators of the fiery tongue,\" taking part. On\r\nthe 13th of August, 1838, a monstre demonstration took place on Holloway\r\nHead, at which it was reckoned there were over 100,000 persons present,\r\nand a petition in favour of \"The Charter\" was adopted that received the\r\nsignatures of 95,000 people in a few days. The Chartist \"National\r\nConvention\" met here May 13, 1839, and noisy assemblages almost daily\r\naffrighted the respectable townsmen out of their propriety. It was\r\nadvised that the people should abstain from all exciseable articles, and\r\n\"run for gold\" upon the savings banks--very good advice when given by\r\nAttwood in 1832, but shockingly wicked in 1839 when given to people who\r\ncould have had but little in the savings or any other banks. This, and\r\nthe meetings which ensued, so alarmed the magistrates for the safety of\r\nproperty that, in addition to swearing in hundreds of special\r\nconstables, they sent to London for a body of police. These arrived on\r\nJuly 4, and unfortunately at the time a stormy meeting was being held in\r\nthe Bull Ring, which they were at once set to disperse, a work soon\r\naccomplished by the free use they made of their staves. The indignant\r\nBrums, however, soon rallied and drove the police into the Station,\r\nseveral being wounded on either side. The latent fury thus engendered\r\nburst out in full force on the 15th when the notorious Chartist Riots\r\ncommenced, but the scenes then enacted, disgraceful as they were, may\r\nwell be left in oblivion, especially as the best of \"the points\" of the\r\nCharter are now part of the laws of the land. Besides many others who\r\nwere punished more or less, two of the leaders, Wm. Lovett and John\r\nCollins, were sentenced to one year's imprisonment for a seditious libel\r\nin saying that \"the people of Birmingham were the best judges of their\r\nown rights to meet in the Bull Ring, and the best judges of their own\r\npower and resources to obtain justice.\" On the 27th July, 1849, Lovett\r\nand Collins were accorded a public welcome on their release from prison,\r\nbeing met at the Angel by a crowd of vehicles, bands of music, &c., and\r\na procession (said to have numbered nearly 30,000), accompanied them to\r\nGosta Green where speeches were delivered; a dinner, at which 800\r\npersons sat down, following on the site of \"The People's Hall of\r\nScience,\" in Loveday Street. In 1841, Joseph Sturge gave in his adhesion\r\nto some movement for the extension of the franchise to the working\r\nclasses, and at his suggestion a meeting was held at the Waterloo Rooms\r\n(Feb. 25th, 1842), and a memorial to the Queen drawn up, which in less\r\nthan a month received 16,000 signatures. On the 5th of April, 87\r\ndelegates from various parts of England, Ireland, and Scotland,\r\nassembled here, and after four days' sitting formed themselves into \"The\r\nNational Complete Suffrage Union,\" whose \"points\" were similar to those\r\nof the Charter, viz., manhood suffrage, abolition of the property\r\nqualification, vote by ballot, equal electoral districts, payment of\r\nelection expenses and of members, and annual Parliaments. On the 27th of\r\nDecember, another Conference was held (at the Mechanics' Institute), at\r\nwhich nearly 400 delegates were present, but the apple of discord had\r\nbeen introduced, and the \"Complete Suffrage Union\" was pooh-poohed by\r\nthe advocates of \"the Charter, the whole Charter, and nothing but the\r\nCharter,\" and our peace-loving townsman, whom _The Times_ had dubbed\r\n\"the Birmingham Quaker Chartist,\" retired from the scene. From that time\r\nuntil the final collapse of the Chartist movement, notwithstanding many\r\nmeetings were held, and strong language often used, Birmingham cannot be\r\nsaid to have taken much part in it, though, in 1848 (August 15th),\r\nGeorge J. Mantle, George White, and Edward King, three local worthies in\r\nthe cause, found themselves in custody for using seditious language.\r\n\r\n~Chauntries.~--In 1330 Walter of Clodeshale, and in 1347 Richard of\r\nClodeshale, the \"Lords of Saltley,\" founded and endowed each a Chauntry\r\nin old St. Martin's Church, wherein daily services should be performed\r\nfor themselves, their wives, and ancestors, in their passage through\r\npurgatory. In like manner, in 1357, Philip de Lutteley gave to the\r\nLutteley chantry in Enville Church, a parcel of land called Morfe Woode,\r\n\"for the health of his soul, and the souls of all the maintained of the\r\nsaid chantry;\" and in 1370 he gave other lands to the chantry, \"for the\r\npriest to pray at the altar of St. Mary for the health of his soul, and\r\nMaud his wife, and of Sir Fulke de Birmingham,\" and of other benefactors\r\nrecited in the deed. It is to be devoutly hoped that the souls of the\r\ndevisees and their friends had arrived safely at their journeys' end\r\nbefore Harry the Eighth's time, for he stopped the prayers by stopping\r\nthe supplies.\r\n\r\n~Cherry Street~ took its name from the large and fruitful cherry orchard\r\nwhich we read of as being a favourite spot about the year 1794.\r\n\r\n~Chess.~--See \"_Sports and Sporting_.\"\r\n\r\n~Chicago Fire.~--The sum of £4,300 was subscribed and sent from here\r\ntowards relieving the sufferers by this calamity.\r\n\r\n~Children.~--A society known as \"The Neglected Children's Aid Society,\"\r\nwas founded in 1862, by Mr. Arthur Ryland, for the purpose of looking\r\nafter and taking care of children under fourteen found wandering or\r\nbegging, homeless or without proper guardianship. It was the means of\r\nrescuing hundreds from the paths of dishonesty and wretchedness, but as\r\nits work was in a great measure taken up by the School Board, the\r\nsociety was dissolved Dec. 17, 1877. Mr. Thos. Middlemore, in 1872,\r\npitying the condition of the unfortunate waifs and strays known as\r\n\"Street Arabs,\" took a house in St. Luke's Road for boys, and one in\r\nSpring Road for girls, and here he has trained nearly a thousand poor\r\nchildren in ways of cleanliness and good behaviour prior to taking the\r\nlarger part of them to Canada. A somewhat similar work, though on a\r\nsmaller scale, is being carried on by Mr. D. Smith, in connection with\r\nthe mission attached to the Bloomsbury Institution. In both instances\r\nthe children are found good homes, and placed with worthy people on\r\ntheir arrival in Canada, and, with scarcely an exception all are doing\r\nwell. The total cost per head while at the Homes and including the\r\npassage money is about £16, and subscriptions will be welcomed, so that\r\nthe work of the Institutions may be extended as much as possible.\r\n\r\n~Chimes.~--The earliest note we can find respecting the chimes in the\r\ntower of St. Martin's is in a record dated 1552, which states there were\r\n\"iiij belles, with a clocke, and a chyme.\"\r\n\r\n~Chimnies.~--Like all manufacturing towns Birmingham is pretty well\r\nornamented with tall chimnies, whose foul mouths belch forth clouds of\r\nsooty blackness, but the loftiest and most substantial belongs to the\r\ntown itself. At the Corporation Wharf in Montague Street the \"stack\" is\r\n258 feet in height, with a base 54 feet in circumference, and an inside\r\ndiameter of 12 feet. About 250,000 bricks were used in its construction,\r\nwhich was completed in September, 1879.--Householders of an economical\r\nturn must remember it is not always the cheapest plan to clean their\r\nchimnies by \"burning them out,\" for in addition to the danger and risk\r\nof damage by so doing, the authorities of Moor Street have the peculiar\r\ncustom of imposing a penalty (generally 10s.) when such cases are\r\nbrought before them. Should such an event occur by mischance keep all\r\ndoors and windows shut, and do not admit the sweeps who may come\r\nknocking at your door, unless fully prepared with the half-crowns they\r\nrequire as bribes not to tell the police. As a rule it is cheaper to\r\ntrust to \"Robert\" not seeing it.\r\n\r\n~China Temple Field~ was a noted place for amusements about the year\r\n1820, and was situate where Cattell Road is now. Originally it formed\r\npart of the grounds of Bordesley Hall, which was wrecked in the riots of\r\n1791.\r\n\r\n~Choral Society.~--This Society held its first Choral Concert, August 2,\r\n1836. The Festival Choral Society was established in 1845.\r\n\r\n~Cholera.~--This dreadful epidemic has never yet been felt in severity\r\nin this town, though several fatal cases were reported in August, 1832.\r\nIn July, 1865, great alarm was caused by the fact of 243 inmates of the\r\nWorkhouse being attacked with choleraic symptoms, but they all\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\n~Church Pastoral Aid Society.~--There is a local branch of this Society\r\nhere, and about £1,300 per annum is gathered in and forwarded to the\r\nparent society, who in return grant sums in aid of the stipends of\r\nthirty Curates and as many Scripture readers, amounting to nearly £4,700\r\nper year.\r\n\r\n~Churchrates.~--Prior to 1831, Churchrates had been regularly levied,\r\nand, to a great extent, cheerfully paid, but with the other reforms of\r\nthat Reforming age came the desire to re-form this impost, by doing away\r\nwith it altogether, and at a meeting held on August 7, 1832, the\r\nratepayers assembled not only denounced it, but petitioned Parliament\r\nfor its entire abolition. Between that year and 1837, Churchrates of 6d.\r\nto 9d. in the £ were not at all infrequent, but in the latter year there\r\nwas a sweet little row, which led to an alteration. At a vestry meeting\r\nheld March 28, the redoubtable George Frederick Muntz, with George\r\nEdmonds, and other \"advanced\" men of the times, demanded a personal\r\nexamination of the books, &c., &c., with the result doubtless\r\nanticipated and wished for--a general shindy, free fight, and tumult.\r\nFor his share in the riot, G.F.M. was put on his trial in the following\r\nyear (March 30 to April 1) and had to pay over £2,000 in the shape of\r\ncosts, but he may be said to have won something after all, for a better\r\nfeeling gradually took the place of rancour, and a system of \"voluntary\"\r\nrates--notably one for the rebuilding of St. Martin's--was happily\r\nbrought to work. The Bill for the abolition of Churchrates was passed\r\nJuly 13, 1868.\r\n\r\n~Church Street.~--In 1764 at Warwick a legal battle was fought as to a\r\nright of way through the New Hall Park, the path in dispute being the\r\nsite of the present Church Street.\r\n\r\n~Circuses.~--The first notice we have of any circus visiting Birmingham\r\nis that of Astley's which came here October 7, 1787. In 1815 Messrs.\r\nAdams gave performances in a \"new equestrian circus on the Moat,\" and it\r\nhas interest in the fact that this was the first appearance locally of\r\nMr. Ryan, a young Irishman, then described as \"indisputably the first\r\ntight-rope dancer in the world of his age.\" Mr. Ryan, a few years later,\r\nstarted a circus on his own account, and after a few years of tent\r\nperformances, which put money in his pocket, ventured on the speculation\r\nof building a permanent structure in Bradford-street, opening his \"New\r\nGrand Arena\" there in 1827. Unfortunately, this proved a failure, and\r\npoor Ryan went to the wall. The circus (known now as the Circus Chapel),\r\nlong lay empty, but was again re-opened May 19, 1838, as an\r\namphitheatre, but not successfully. In 1839 the celebrated Van Amburgh,\r\nwhose establishment combined the attractions of a circus and a\r\nmenagerie, visited this town, and his performances were held, rather\r\nstrangely, at the Theatre Royal. On the night of the Bull Ring Riots,\r\nJuly 15th, when there was \"a full house,\" the startling news that a\r\nnumber of buildings were on fire, &c., was shouted out just at the\r\nmoment that Van Amburgh was on the stage with a number of his\r\nwell-trained animals. He himself was reclining on the boards, his head\r\nresting on the sides of a tawny lion, while in his arms was a beautiful\r\nchild, four or five years old, playing with the ears of the animal. The\r\nintelligence naturally caused great excitement, but the performer went\r\nquietly on, hoisting the little darling to his shoulder, and putting his\r\nanimals through their tricks as calmly as if nothing whatever was the\r\nmatter. In 1842, Ducrow's famous troupe came, and once again opened\r\nRyan's Circus in the Easter week, and that was the last time the\r\nbuilding was used for the purpose it was originally erected for.\r\nCooke's, Hengler's, Newsome's, and Sanger's periodical visits are\r\nmatters of modern date. The new building erected by Mr. W.R. Inshaw, at\r\nfoot of Snow Hill, for the purposes of a Concert Hall, will be adaptable\r\nas a Circus.\r\n\r\n~Climate.~--From the central position in which Birmingham is situated,\r\nand its comparative elevation, the town has always been characterised as\r\none of the healthiest in the kingdom. Dr. Priestley said the air\r\nbreathed here was as pure as any he had analysed. Were he alive now and\r\nin the habit of visiting the neighbourhood of some of our rolling mills,\r\n&c., it is possible he might return a different verdict, but\r\nnevertheless the fact remains that the rates of mortality still contrast\r\nmost favourably as against other large manufacturing towns.\r\n\r\n~Clocks.~--One of Boulton's specialties was the manufacture of clocks,\r\nbut it was one of the few branches that did not pay him. Two of his\r\nfinest astronomical clocks were bought by the Empress of Russia, after\r\nbeing offered for sale in this country in vain. His friend, Dr. Small,\r\nis said to have invented a timepiece containing but a single wheel. The\r\n\"town clocks\" of the present day are only worth notice on account of\r\ntheir regular irregularity, and those who wish to be always \"up to the\r\ntime o' day,\" had best set their watches by the instrument placed in the\r\nwall of the Midland Institute. The dome of the Council House would be a\r\ngrand position in which to place a really good clock, and if the dials\r\nwere fitted with electric lights it would be useful at all hours, from\r\nnear and far.\r\n\r\n~Clubs.~--No place in the kingdom can record the establishment of more\r\nclubs than Birmingham, be they Friendly Clubs, Money Clubs (so-called),\r\nor the more taking Political Clubs, and it would be a hard task to name\r\nthem all, or say how they flourished, or dropped and withered. In the\r\nyears 1850-60 it was estimated that at publichouses and coffeehouses\r\nthere were not less than 180 Money Clubs, the members paying in weekly\r\nor fortnightly subscriptions of varying amount for shares £5 to £100,\r\nand though there cannot be the slightest doubt that many of our present\r\nmastermen owe their success in life to this kind of mutual help, the\r\nspirit of gambling in money shares proved, on the whole, to be\r\ndisastrous to the members who went in for good interest on their\r\ndeposits. Of Friendly Clubs we shall have something to say under another\r\nbeading. Respecting the Political Clubs and those of a general nature we\r\nmay say that the earliest we have note of is the \"Church and King Club,\"\r\nwhose first meeting was held at the Royal Hotel, Nov. 27, 1792. Of a\r\nslightly different nature was the \"Hampden Club,\" established in 1815,\r\nbut which was closed by the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in 1817.\r\nDuring the troublous times of 1830-40, many clubs, or \"smoke-room\r\npalavers,\" existed, but, perhaps the only one that really showed results\r\nwas the Branch Club (or local agency), connected with the Land Scheme of\r\nFeargus O'Connor [see \"_Land Societies_\"], and that ultimately dwindled\r\nto naught. On July 5, 1847, a club on the plan of the London\r\n\"Whittington\" was started here, but when or why it ended deponent\r\nknoweth not.--The Union Clubhouse, corner of Newhall Street and Colmore\r\nRow, which cost £16,000, was built in 1868-9, being opened May 3rd of\r\nthe latter year. This must be considered as the chief neutral ground in\r\nlocal club matters, gentlemen of all shades of politics, &c., being\r\nmembers. The number of members is limited to 400, with 50 \"temporary\"\r\nmembers, the entrance fee being £15 15s., and the annual subscription £7\r\n7s.--The Town and District Club, opened at the Shakespeare Rooms, in\r\nAugust, 1876, also started on the non-political theory: the town members\r\npaying £3 3s per annum, and country members a guinea or guinea and half,\r\naccording to their residence being within 25 or 100 miles.--A Liberal\r\nClub was founded October 16, 1873, under the auspices of Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain and took possession of its present rooms in Corporation\r\nStreet, January 20, 1880, pending the completion of the palatial edifice\r\nnow in course of erection in Edmund Street, at the corner of Congreve\r\nStreet. The \"Forward Liberal Club,\" opened in Great Hampton Street,\r\nOctober 30, 1880. A \"Junior Liberal Club\" celebrated their establishment\r\nby a meeting in the Town Hall, November 16, 1880. The Conservatives, of\r\ncourse, have not been at all backward in Club matters, for there has\r\nbeen some institution or other of the kind connected with the party for\r\nthe last hundred years. The Midland Conservative Club was started July\r\n4, 1872, and has its head-quarters now in Waterloo-street, the old\r\nCounty Court buildings being remodelled for the purpose. A Junior\r\nConservative Club opened in Castle Street, June 25, 1874; a Young Men's\r\nConservative Club commenced July 26, 1876; the Belmont Conservative\r\nClub, July 30, 1877; and the Hampton Conservative Club, August 21st of\r\nsame year. In fact, every ward in the borough, and every parish and\r\nhamlet in the suburbs now has its Conservative and Liberal Club; the\r\nworkingmen having also had _their_ turn at Club-making, the Birmingham\r\nHeath working men opening up shop, August 25, 1864; the Saltley boys in\r\nOctober, 1868; the St. Albanites following suit December 1, 1873; and\r\nthe Ladywood men, November 30, 1878. A Club of more pretentious\r\ncharacter, and called _par excellence \"The_ Working-man's Club,\" was\r\nbegun July 20, 1863, but the industriously-inclined members thereof did\r\nnot work together well, and allowed the affair to drop through. Backed\r\nby several would-be-thought friends of the working class, another\r\n\"Working Men's Club\" sprung into existence April 29, 1875, with a\r\nnominal capital of £2,500 in 10s. shares. Rooms were opened in Corn\r\nExchange Passage on the 31st of May, and for a time all promised well.\r\nUnfortunately the half-sovereigns did not come in very fast, and the\r\nlandlord, though he knew \"Nap\" to be a very favourite game, did not\r\nchoose, to be caught napping, and therefore \"took his rest\" at the end\r\nof the fifth half-year, and in so doing rent the whole fabric of the\r\nclub.--The Edgbaston Art Club was organised in 1878; the Chess Club in\r\n1841; the Germania Club in 1856; the Gymnastic Club in 1866; the\r\nDramatic Club in May, 1865; the Farmer's Club in May, 1864, the Pigeon\r\nflying Club at Quilter's in 1875, &c., &c. Club law has great\r\nattractions for the Brums--every profession and every trade hath its\r\nclub, and all the \"fanciers\" of every sort and kind club by themselves,\r\ntill their name is \"Legion.\"\r\n\r\n~Coaches.~--From its being situated as it were in the very heart of the\r\nkingdom, Birmingham, in the olden days, and it is but fifty years ago,\r\nwas an important converging central-point of the great mailcoach system,\r\nand a few notes in connection therewith cannot be uninteresting. Time\r\nwas when even coaching was not known, for have we not read how long it\r\ntook ere the tidings of Prince Rupert's attack on our town reached\r\nLondon. A great fear seems to have possessed the minds of the powers\r\nthat were in regard to any kind of quick transmission whatever, for in\r\nthe year 1673 it was actually proposed \"to suppress the public coaches\r\nthat ran within fifty or sixty miles of London,\" and to limit all the\r\nother vehicles to a speed of \"thirty miles per day in summer, and\r\ntwenty-five in winter\"--for what might not be dreaded from such an\r\nannouncement as that \"that remarkable swift travelling coach, 'The Fly,'\r\nwould leave Birmingham on Mondays and reach London on the Thursdays\r\nfollowing.\" Prior to and about 1738, an occasional coach was put on the\r\nroad, but not as a regular and periodical conveyance, the fare to London\r\nbeing 25 shillings, \"children on lap, and footmen behind, being charged\r\nhalf-price.\" A \"Flying Coach\" commenced running direct to the Metropolis\r\non May 28th, 1745, and was evidently thought to be an event of some\r\nimportance, as it was advertised to do the distance in two days \"if the\r\nroads permitted.\" In July, 1782, the same journey was accomplished in 14\r\nhours, showing a great improvement in the arrangements of the road. The\r\nfirst mail coaches for the conveyance of letters was started by Mr.\r\nPalmer, of Bath, in 1784, the earliest noticed as passing through here\r\nbeing on August 23, 1785, but the first direct mail from this town dates\r\nonly from May 25, 1812. In February, 1795, the Western mailcoaches were\r\ndelayed nearly a week together in consequence of a rapid thaw rendering\r\nthe roads impassable. In 1777 fifty-two coaches passed through here to\r\nLondon and sixteen to Bristol every week. In 1829 at least 100 departed\r\nfrom or passed through the town daily, 550 persons travelling between\r\nhere and London. In 1832 Mr. Lecount estimated the general results of\r\nthe road and canal traffic between here and London as follows:\r\nPessengers, 233,155; goods, 62,389 tons; parcels, 46,799; beasts,\r\n50,839; sheep, 365,000; pigs, 15,364; the amount expended in cost of\r\ntransit being £1,338,217. In 1837 it was estimated that £6,789 was\r\nreceived per week from coach passengers on the road from here to London,\r\n£1,571 for parcels per coach, and £729 from persons posting along the\r\nsame roads; and that £8,120 was received for goods by canals and\r\nwaggons, not including iron, timber, cattle, minerals, or other goods at\r\nlow tonnage--£17,209 _per week_. There was, notwithstanding the large\r\nnumber of coaches leaving here every day, no direct conveyance from\r\nBirmingham to Edinburgh. The best and usual route was by Walsall,\r\nManchester, Preston, and Carlisle; distances and times being,\r\nManchester, 78-1/2 miles, 8 hours, fare, 14s.; Manchester to Carlisle,\r\n118 miles, 12 hours 55 minutes by the mail, including stoppage of fifty\r\nminutes at Preston for post office purposes, fare, £1 2s. 6d.; Carlisle\r\nto Edinburgh, 95 miles, 9 hours 35 minutes, fare, 18s.; coachmen and\r\nguards' fees about 15s.; all hotel charges, &c., were paid by the\r\npassenger. Total distance, 291-1/2 miles; travelling time, 30-1/2 hours;\r\ncost, £3 9s. 6d., in all. The mail coach which left the Albion reached\r\nLondon in 10-1/2 hours, which would be reckoned as very good travelling,\r\neven in these days. For some time after the introduction of railways,\r\nthe coaching interest was still of some account, for as late as 1840\r\nthere were 54 coaches and omnibuses running from here every 24 hours.--\r\nThere has been a kind of modern revival of the good old coaching days,\r\nbut it has not become popular in this part of the country, though quite\r\na summer feature on the Brighton Road. A four-in-hand, driven by the\r\nEarl of Aylesford, was put on the road from here to Coventry, at latter\r\nend of April, 1878; and another ran for part of the summer, in 1880, to\r\nLeamington. The introduction of railways set many persons to work on the\r\nmaking of \"steam coaches\" to travel on the highways. Captain Ogle coming\r\nhere on one of his own inventing September 8th, 1832, direct from\r\nOxford, having travelled at from ten to fourteen miles per hour. Our\r\nlocal geniuses were not behindhand, and Messrs. Heaton Bros., and the\r\nwell-known Dr. Church brought out machines for the purpose. Both parties\r\nstarted joint-stock companies to carry out their inventions, and in that\r\nrespect both parties succeeded, for such was the run for shares, that in\r\nJune, 1833, when Heatons' prospectus came out, offering to the public\r\n2,000 £10 shares, no less than 3,000 were asked for in one day. There\r\nwas also a third company in the field, the \"London, Birmingham, and\r\nLiverpool,\" with a nominal capital of £300,000; but none of them\r\nprospered; for though they could construct the engines and the coaches,\r\nthey could not make receipts cover expenses. Heatons' ran theirs for\r\nsome little time to Wolverhampton and back, and even to the Lickey; the\r\nDoctor came out every month with something new; and even the big Co.\r\nmanaged to bring one carriage all the way from London (August 28th,\r\n1835). Others besides Captain Ogle also came here on their iron horses,\r\nand there was plenty of fun and interest for the lookers-on generally--\r\nbut no trade and no interest for the speculators. For steam coaches of\r\nthe present day, see \"_Tramways_.\"\r\n\r\n~Coal~ was not in common use much before 1625, and for a long time was\r\nrather shunned by householders, more especially in the rural parts where\r\nthe black diamonds were looked upon as something altogether uncanny.\r\nPrior to the opening of the first canal, the roads leading from the\r\nBlack Country daily presented the curious feature of an almost unending\r\nprocession of carts and waggons bringing the supplies needed by our\r\nmanufacturers, and high prices were the rule of the day. The first\r\nboatload was brought in on November 6th, 1769, and soon after the price\r\nof coal at the wharf was as low as 4d. per cwt.--See \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Cobbett~ delivered a lecture on the Corn Laws, &c., at Beardsworth's\r\nRepository, May 10 1830.\r\n\r\n~Cobden.~--There was a general closing of places of business here on\r\nApril 6, 1865, the day on which Richard Cobden was buried.\r\n\r\n~Cockfighting.~--_Aris's Gazette_ of December 26, 1780, announced in one\r\nof its advertisements that \"the Annual Subscription Match of Cocks\"\r\nwould be fought at Duddeston Hall, commonly called \"Vauxhall,\" on the\r\nNew Year's day and day after.--The same paper printed an account of\r\nanother Cockfight, at Sutton, as late as April 17, 1875.\r\n\r\n~Coffeehouses.~--Coffee, which takes its name from the Abyssinian\r\nprovince of Kaffa, was introduced into this country in the early part of\r\nthe 17th century, the first coffeehouse being opened in London in 1652.\r\nUntil very late years coffeehouses in provincial towns were more noted\r\nfor their stuffy untidiness than aught else, those of Birmingham not\r\nexcepted, but quite a change has come o'er the scene now, and with all\r\nthe brave glitter of paint and glaring gas they attempt to rival the\r\npublic-houses. The Birmingham Coffeehouse Company, Limited (originally\r\nmiscalled The Artizan's Clubhouse Company), which came into existence\r\nMarch 27, 1877, with a capital of £20,000 in 10s. shares, has now near\r\nupon a score of houses open, and their business is so successful that\r\nvery fair dividends are realised.\r\n\r\n~Coffins.~--Excluding textile fabrics and agricultural produce,\r\nBirmingham supplies almost every article necessary for the comfort of\r\nman's life, and it is therefore not surprising that some little\r\nattention has been given to the construction of the \"casket\" which is to\r\nenclose his remains when dead. Coffins of wood, stone, lead, &c., have\r\nbeen known for centuries, but coffins of glass and coffins of brass must\r\nbe ranked amongst the curiosities of our later trades. Two of the latter\r\nkind polished, lacquered, and decorated in a variety of ways, with\r\nmassive handles and emblazoned shields, were made here some few years\r\nback for King Egbo Jack and another dark-skinned potentate of South\r\nAfrica. \"By particular request\" each of these coffins were provided with\r\nfour padlocks, two outside and two inside, though how to use the latter\r\nmust have been a puzzle even for a dead king. The Patent Metallic\r\nAir-tight Coffin Co., whose name pretty accurately describes their\r\nproductions, in 1861 introduced hermetically-sealed coffins with plate\r\nglass panels in the lid, exceedingly useful articles in case of\r\ncontagious diseases, &c., &c. The trade in coffin \"furniture\" seems to\r\nhave originated about 1760, when one ingenious \"Mole\" pushed it forward;\r\nand among the list of patents taken out in 1796 by a local worthy there\r\nis one for \"a patent coffin,\" though its particular speciality could not\r\nhave met with much approval, as although some thousands of bodies have\r\nbeen removed from our various sepultures nothing curious or rarer than\r\nrotten boards and old lead has been brought to light.\r\n\r\n~Coinage.~--So far had our patriotic forefathers proceeded in the art of\r\nmaking money that about the middle of the last century it was estimated\r\nover one half the copper coin in circulation was counterfeit, and that\r\nnine-tenths thereof was manufactured in Birmingham, where 1,000\r\nhalfpennies could be had of the makers for 25s. Boulton's big pennies\r\nwere counterfeited by lead pennies faced with copper. One of these would\r\nbe a curiosity now. The bronze coinage was first issued December 1,\r\n1860, and soon after Messrs. Ralph Heaton & Sons made 100 tons of bronze\r\ncoins for the Mint. They are distinguished by the letter \"H\" under the\r\ndate. The number, weight, and value of this issue were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tons                            Nominal Value.\r\n  62 or 9,595,245 pennies     ..  £25,396  17   1\r\n  28 or 5,504,382 halfpennies ..   11,469  10  11\r\n  10 or 3,884,446 farthings   ..    4,096   5   4\r\n  ----------------                 --------------\r\n  100 or 15,484,043 pieces    ..  £40,962  13   4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same firm has had several similar contracts, the last being in hand\r\nat the present time. The bronze is composed of 95 parts copper, 4 tin,\r\nand 1 zinc.\r\n\r\n~Colleges.~--See \"_Schools_,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Colmore Row,~ which now extends from the Council House to the Great\r\nWestern Hotel (including Ann Street and Monmouth Street) is named after\r\nthe Colmore family, the owners of the freehold. Great Colmore Street,\r\nCaroline and Charlotte Streets, Great and Little Charles Streets,\r\nCregoe, Lionel, and Edmund Streets, all take their names from the same\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n~Colonnade.~--This very handsome and (for Birmingham) rather\r\nnovel-looking building, was opened Jan. 10, 1883, being erected by Mr.\r\nA. Humpage, at a cost of about £70,000, from the designs of Mr. W.H.\r\nWard. The Colonnade proper runs round the entire building, giving\r\nfrontage to a number of shops, the upper portion of the block being\r\npartly occupied by the Midland Conservative Club, and the rest of the\r\nbuilding, with the basement, fitted up as a Temperance Hotel and\r\n\"Restaurant.\"\r\n\r\n~Comets.~--The inhabitants were very much terrified by the appearance of\r\na comet in December, 1680. At Michaelmas, 1811, an exceedingly brilliant\r\ncomet appeared, supposed to have been the same which was seen at the\r\nbirth of Jesus Christ. Donati's comet was first observed June 2, 1858,\r\nbut was most brilliant in September and October. The comets of 1861 and\r\n1883 were also visible here.\r\n\r\n~Commissioners.~--The first local governing body of the town, though\r\nwith but the merest shadow of power as compared with the Corporation of\r\nto-day, were the Street Commissioners appointed under an Act of Geo.\r\nIII. in 1769, their duties being confined almost solely to repairing,\r\ncleansing, and \"enlightening\" the streets of the town, appointing\r\nwatchmen, &c., their power of raising funds being limited to 1s. in the\r\n£. By succeeding Acts of 1773, 1801, 1812, and 1828, the powers of the\r\nCommissioners were considerably enlarged, and they must be credited with\r\nthe introduction of the first set of local improvement schemes,\r\nincluding the widening of streets, clearing the Bull Ring of the houses\r\nround St. Martin's Church, making owners lay out proper streets for\r\nbuilding, purchasing the market tolls, building of Town Hall and Market\r\nHall, regulating carriages, and \"suppressing the smoke nuisance arising\r\nfrom engines commonly called steam engines,\" &c., and, though they came\r\nin for their full share of obloquy and political rancour, it cannot be\r\ndenied they did good and faithful service to the town. The Commissioners\r\nhad the power of electing themselves, every vacancy being filled as it\r\noccurred by those who remained, and, as the Act of 1828 increased their\r\nnumber to no less than 89, perhaps some little excuse may be made for\r\nthe would-be leading men of the day who were left out in the cold. Be\r\nthat as it may, the Charter of Incorporation put them aside, and gave\r\ntheir power and authority into the hands of a popularly-elected\r\nrepresentative body. The Commissioners, however, remained as a body in\r\nname until the last day of December, 1851, when, as a token of\r\nremembrance, they presented the town with the ornamental fountain\r\nformerly standing in the centre of the Market Hall, but which has been\r\nremoved to Highgate Park. On the transfer of their powers to the\r\nCorporation, the Commissioners handed over a schedule of indebtedness,\r\nshowing that there was then due on mortgage of the \"lamp rate,\" of 4 per\r\ncent, £87,350; on the \"Town Hall rate,\" at 4 per cent., £25,000;\r\nannuities, £947 3s. 4d.; besides £7,800, at 5 percent., borrowed by the\r\nDuddeston and Nechells Commissioners, making a total of £121,097 3s. 4d.\r\n\r\n~Commons.~--Handsworth Common was enclosed in 1793. An Act was passed in\r\n1798 for enclosing and allotting the commons and waste land in\r\nBirmingham. The commons and open fields of Erdington and Witton were\r\nenclosed and divided in 1801.\r\n\r\n~Concert Halls, &c.~--The Birmingham Concert Hall, better known as\r\n\"Holder's,\" was built in 1846, though for years previous the house was\r\nnoted for its harmonic meetings; the present Hall has seats for 2,200\r\npersons. Day's Concert Hall was erected in 1862 the opening night,\r\nSeptember 17, being for the benefit of the Queen's Hospital, when £70\r\nwas realised therefor; the Hall will accommodate 1,500.--The Museum\r\nConcert Hall was opened Dec. 20, 1863, and will hold about 1,000\r\npeople.--A very large building intended for use as a Concert Hall, &c.,\r\nwill soon be opened in Snow Hill, to be conducted on temperance\r\nprinciples.--A series of popular Monday evening concerts was commenced\r\nin the Town Hall, Nov. 12, 1844, and was continued for nearly two\r\nyears.--Twopenny weekly \"Concerts for the People\" were started at the\r\nMusic Hall, Broad Street (now Prince of Wales' Theatre), March 25, 1847,\r\nbut they did not take well.--Threepenny Saturday evening concerts in\r\nTown Hall, were begun in November, 1879.\r\n\r\n~Conferences and Congresses~ of all sorts of people have been held here\r\nfrom time to time, and a few dates are here annexed:--A Conference of\r\nWesleyan ministers took place in 1836, in 1844, 1854, 1865, and 1879,\r\nbeing the 136th meeting of that body. Four hundred Congregational\r\nministers met in Congress Oct. 5, 1862. A Social Science Congress was\r\nheld Sept. 30, 1868. A Trades Union Conference Aug. 23, 1869. National\r\nEducation League Conference, Oct. 12, 1869. National Republican\r\nConference, May 12, 1873. Conference on Sanitary Reform, Jan. 14, 1875.\r\nA Co-operative Societies Conference, July 3, 1875. A Conference of\r\nChristians in Needless Alley, Oct. 27, 1875. The Midland Counties'\r\nChurch Defence Associations met in the Exchange, Jan. 18, 1876, and on\r\nthe 9th of Feb. the advocates for disestablishing and disendowing the\r\nChurch said their say in the Masonic Hall, resolutions in favour of\r\nsharing the loaves and fishes being enthusiastically carried by the good\r\npeople who covet not their neighbours' goods. A Domestic Economy\r\nCongress was held July 17, 1877. A Church Conference held sittings Nov.\r\n7, 1877. The friends of International Arbitration met in the Town Hall,\r\nMay 2, 1878, when 800 delegates were present, but the swords are not yet\r\nbeaten into ploughshares. How to lessen the output of coal was discussed\r\nMarch 5, 1878, by a Conference of Miners, who not being then able to\r\nsettle the question, met again June 17, 1879, to calmly consider the\r\nadvisableness of laying idle all the coalpits in the country for a time,\r\nas the best remedy they could find for the continued reduction of wages.\r\nThe 18th Annual Conference of the British Association of Gas Managers\r\nwas held here June 14, 1881, when about 500 of those gentlemen attended.\r\nA considerable amount of gassy talk anent the wonderful future naturally\r\narose, and an endowment fund of £323 was banked to provide a medal for\r\n\"any originality in connection with the manufacture and application of\r\ngas,\" but the Gas Committee of Birmingham, without any vast improvement\r\nin the manufacture, still keep to _their_ original idea of sharing\r\nprofits with ratepayers, handing over £25,000 each year to the Borough\r\nrates. On Bank Holiday, August 6, 1883, a Conference of Bakers took\r\nplace here, and at the same date the 49th \"High Court\" of Foresters\r\nassembled at the Town Hall, their last visit having been in 1849.\r\n\r\n~Conservative Associations~ have been in existence for at least fifty\r\nyears, as the formation of one in December, 1834, is mentioned in the\r\npapers of the period. The present one, which is formed on a somewhat\r\nsimilar plan to that of the Liberal Association, and consists of 300\r\nrepresentatives chosen from the wards, held its first meeting May 18,\r\n1877. Associations of a like nature have been formed in most of the\r\nwards, and in Balsall Heath, Moseley, Aston, Handsworth, and all the\r\nsuburbs and places around.\r\n\r\n~Constables.~--In 1776 it was necessary to have as many as 25 constables\r\nsworn in to protect the farmers coming to the weekly market.--See also\r\n\"_Police_.\"\r\n\r\n~Consuls.~--There are Consulates here for the following countries (for\r\naddresses see _Directory_):--Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chili, France,\r\nGermany, Greece, Liberia, Portugal, Spain and Italy, Turkey, United\r\nStates, United States of Columbia, and Uruguay.\r\n\r\n~Convents.~--See \"_Religious Institutions_.\"\r\n\r\n~Co-operative Societies~ at one time were put in the same category as\r\nChartist, Socialist, and Communistic Associations, all banned alike.\r\nNevertheless, in the old \"Reform days\" the theory of co-operation was\r\nmost enthusiastically taken up by the workers of this town, even more so\r\nthan in any other place in the kingdom. As early as 1828 several\r\nattempts had been made to form such societies, but the one which\r\nappeared the most likely to succeed was the so-called \"Labour Exchange,\"\r\nsituated in the old Coach Yard, in Bull Street, formed on the basis so\r\neloquently and perseveringly advocated by Robert Owen. The principle of\r\nthis Exchange was to value all goods brought in at the cost of the raw\r\nmaterial, plus the labour and work bestowed thereon, the said labour\r\nbeing calculated at the uniform rate of 6d. per hour. On the reception\r\nof the goods \"notes\" to the value were given which could be handed over\r\nas equivalent for any other articles there on sale, and for a time this\r\nrather crude plan was successful. Sharp customers, however found that by\r\ngiving in an advanced valuation of their own goods they could by using\r\ntheir \"notes\" procure others on which a handsome profit was to be made\r\noutside the Labour Mart, and this ultimately brought the Exchange to\r\ngrief. Mr. William Pare and Mr. George Jacob Holyoake, were foremost\r\namong the advocates of Co-operation at the period, and a most\r\ninteresting history of \"Co-operation in England\" has been written by the\r\nlatter gentleman. Other societies were also in operation from time to\r\ntime, the longest-lived being the \"Economic Provision Company,\" which\r\nwas commenced at Handsworth in 1830 by some of the workers at Soho and\r\nSoho Foundry, 139 of whom clubbed 20s. each as a starting fund. After a\r\nfew months' trial, the profits were allowed to accumulate until they\r\nmade up £5 per share, on which capital no less than £6,000 were paid in\r\ndividends during the first thirty years. The Supply Associations of the\r\npresent day are somewhat differently constituted, such establishments as\r\nthe one in Corporation Street (formerly in Cannon Street) and that in\r\nHigh Street being on the most extensive scale, offering to the general\r\npublic all the advantages derivable from the use of large capital,\r\ncombined with a fair division of profits to the customer, as well as to\r\nthe shareholders. The Birmingham Household Supply Association in\r\nCorporation Street supplies all the necessaries required in the\r\nhousehold, in addition to eatables and drinkables of the very best\r\nquality, including Messrs. Walter Showell and Sons' ales, which are sent\r\nout at the same prices as from the firm's own offices, either in cask or\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n~Cornavii.~--The ancient inhabitants of this part of England, but who\r\nwere subdued by the Romans. Whether the said inhabitants had any name\r\nfor the particular spot now called Birmingham must for ever remain\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n~Corn Exchange,~ in High-street, was opened October 28, 1847. The\r\noriginal capital of the Company was £5,000, in shares of £25 each; but\r\nthe total cost of erection was a little over £6,000. The length of the\r\ninterior is 172 feet and the breadth 40 feet.\r\n\r\n~Corn Laws.~--Long before the formation of the Anti-Corn Law League in\r\n1838, a movement for the repeal of the obnoxious imposts had been\r\nstarted in this town, a petition being sent from here to Parliament in\r\nMarch, 1815, with 48,600 signatures attached. The doings of the League\r\nand their ultimate success is an off-told tale, the men of Birmingham of\r\ncourse taking their part in the struggle, which culminated on the 26th\r\nof June, 1846, in the passing of Sir Robert Peel's Bill for the total\r\nrepeal of all duties levied on corn and breadstuffs.\r\n\r\n~Coroners.~--The first borough coroner, the late Dr. Birt Davies, was\r\nappointed May 15, 1839, and he held the office till July, 1875, when Mr.\r\nHenry Hawkes was chosen as his successor, only one member of the Town\r\nCouncil voting against him. The preent coroner has introduced several\r\nimprovements on the old system, especially in the matters of holding\r\ninquests at public-houses, and the summoning of jurors. Formerly the\r\nlatter were chosen from the residents nearest to the scene of death,\r\nsome gentlemen being continually called upon, while the occasional\r\nexhibition of a dead body in the back lumberroom of an inn yard, among\r\nbroken bottles and gaping stablemen, was not conductive to the dignity\r\nof a coroner's court or particularly agreeable to the unfortunate\r\nsurgeon who might have to perform a _post mortem_. Thanks to the\r\npersevering tenacity of Mr. Hawkes we have a proper court in\r\nMoor-street, and a mortuary at every police station to which bodies can\r\nat once be taken. The jurors are now chosen by rotation, so that having\r\nbeen once called upon to act as a good citizen in such a capacity no\r\ngentleman need fear a fresh summons for some years to come. Mr. Hooper,\r\nthe coroner for South Staffordshire, received his appointment in 1860.\r\n\r\n~Corporation.~--The Charter of Incorporation of the Borough of\r\nBirmingham, authorising the formation of a Governing body, consisting of\r\nMayor, Aldermen, and Councillors, duly elected by the Burgesses, dates\r\nfrom October 31, 1838. The elections took place in December, the first\r\nmeeting being held on the 27. The borough was originally divided into 13\r\nwards, but has since been, by Order in Council, made into 16, though the\r\nnumber of Aldermen (16) and Councillors (48) has not been increased. The\r\nMayor is elected for one year, the Councillors for three, and the\r\nAldermen for six. The first Mayor chosen was William Schofield, Esq.,\r\nwho was succeeded by P.H. Muntz, Esq., in 1839 and 1840, the election\r\ntaking place at the November sitting in each year. Since 1840, the\r\nMayoral chair has been successively filled by:--\r\n\r\n1841, S. Beale; 1842, J. James; 1843, T. Weston; 1844, T. Phillips;\r\n1845, H. Smith; 1846, R. Martineau; 1847, C. Geach; 1848, S. Thornton;\r\n1849, W. Lucy; 1850, W. Lucy; 1851, H. Smith; 1852, H. Hawkes; 1853, J.\r\nBaldwin; 1854, J. Palmer; 1855, T. R, T. Hodgson; 1856, J. Ratcliff;\r\n1857, J. Ratcliff; 1858, Sir J. Ratcliff, Kt.; 1859, T. Lloyd; 1860, A.\r\nRyland; 1861, H. Manton; 1862, C. Sturge; 1863, W. Holliday; 1864, H.\r\nWiggin; 1865, E. Yates; 1866, G. Dixon; 1867, T. Avery; 1868, H.\r\nHolland; 1869, T. Prime; 1870, G. B. Lloyd; 1871, J. Sadler; 1872, A.\r\nBiggs; 1873, J. Chamberlain; 1874, J. Chamberlain; 1875, J. Chamberlain;\r\n1876, G. Baker; 1877, W. Kenrick; 1878, J. Collings; 1879, R.\r\nChamberlain; 1880, R. Chamberlain; 1881, T. Avery; 1882, W. White; 1883,\r\nW. Cook; 1884, W. Martineau.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Council in 1862 subscribed £200 for the purchase of a\r\n\"Mayor's Chain,\" the first to wear \"the glittering gaud,\" strange to\r\nsay, being a Quaker, Charles Sturge to wit. To this chain a valuable\r\naddition has since been made in the shape of a stone, worth £150,\r\npresented to the Town Council by Mr. W. Spencer, June 27, 1873, as being\r\nthe first diamond cut in Birmingham, and which was appropriately\r\nmounted. For the names and addresses of the Aldermen and Councillors of\r\nthe various wards (changes taking place yearly) reference should be made\r\nto \"The Birmingham Red Book\" published annually, in which will also be\r\nfound a list of all the borough officials, &c.\r\n\r\n~Corporation Stock.~--The balance against the Borough in the shape of\r\nloans, or mortgages on the then rates, when the Town Council took over\r\nfrom the Street Commissioners was £121,100. By the end of 1864 the\r\nBorough debts stood at £638,300, at varying rates of interest. After the\r\npurchase of the Gas and Water Works, and the commencement of the\r\nImprovement Scheme, this amount was vastly increased, the town's\r\nindebtedness standing in 1880 at no less than £6,226,145. The old system\r\nof obtaining loans at the market price of the day, and the requirement\r\nof the Local Government Board that every separate loan should be repaid\r\nin a certain limited number of years, when so large an amount as 6-1/4\r\nmillions came to be handled necessitated a consolidation scheme, which\r\nhas since been carried out, to the relief of present ratepayers and a\r\nsaving to those who will follow. The whole of the liabilities in the\r\nBorough on loans were converted into Corporation three and a half per\r\ncent. stock at the commencement of 1881, the operation being performed\r\nby the Bank of England. The tenders for same were opened Jan. 18th, when\r\nit was found that £1,200,000 had been applied for at and slightly over\r\nthe minimum rate of £98 per £100. The remaining £800,000 was allotted to\r\na syndicate, who afterwards applied for it at the minimum price. Persons\r\nhaving money to invest cannot do better than visit the Borough\r\nTreasurer, Mr. Hughes, who will give every information as to the mode of\r\ninvesting even a £10 note in the Birmingham Corporation Stock.\r\n\r\n~Council House.~--See \"_Public Buildings_.\"\r\n\r\n~County Areas.~--The total areas of this and adjoining counties are:--\r\nWarwickshire 566,458 acres, Worcestershire 472,453, Staffordshire\r\n732,434, and Shropshire 841,167.\r\n\r\n~County Court.~--First opened in Birmingham at the Waterloo Rooms,\r\nWaterloo Street, April 28th, 1847. R. G. Welford, Esq., Q.C., acting as\r\njudge until September, 1872. He was followed by H. W. Cole, Esq., Q.C.,\r\nwho died in June, 1876; James Motteram, Esq., Q.C., who died Sept. 19,\r\n1884: the present judge being W. Chambers, Esq., Q.C. The Circuit (No.\r\n21) includes the towns and places of Aston, Atherstone, Balsall Heath,\r\nCurdworth, Castle Bromwich, Erdington, Gravelly Hill, Handsworth,\r\nHarborne, King's Heath, King's Norton, Lea Marston, Little Bromwich,\r\nMaxstoke, Minworth, Moseley, Nether Whitacre, Perry Barr, Saltley, Selly\r\nOak, Sutton Coldfield, Tamworth, Water Orton and Wishaw.\r\n\r\n~County Officials.~--For names and addresses of the Lord Lieutenant,\r\nDeputy Lieutenant, High Sheriff, County Magistrates, and other official\r\ngentlemen connected with the county of Warwick, see \"Red Book.\"\r\n\r\n~Court of Bankruptcy~ holden at Birmingham (at the County Court, in\r\nCorporation Street) comprises all the places within the district of the\r\nCounty Court of Warwickshire holden at Birmingham, Tamworth and\r\nSolihull, and all the places in the district of the County Court of\r\nWorcestershire holden at Redditch.\r\n\r\n~Court Of Judicature.~--Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsall, and\r\nWorcester, are District Registries of the Supreme Court of Judicature.\r\n\r\n~Court Leet.~--The origin of that peculiar kind of Local Government\r\nBoard, known in the olden days as the Court Leet of the Manor of\r\nBirmingham, is lost in the misty shadows of our past history. Doubtless\r\nthere were many onerous duties connected therewith, and very possibly\r\nthe officials considered themselves as \"men of high degree,\" but what\r\nthose duties actually were, and what the remuneration for their due\r\nfulfilment, appears to have been matter of doubt, even so late as a\r\nhundred and a few odd years ago. The rights, powers, and privileges of\r\nthe officers of this Court had evidently been questioned by some of our\r\nRadical-minded great-grandfathers, as we find it was deemed necessary to\r\nassemble a jury on the 20th day of October, 1779, to \"ascertain and\r\npresent\" the same, and from a little pamphlet at that time published, we\r\nextract the following:--\r\n\r\n_The Office of Low Bailiff_.--\"The Jury find and present that this\r\nofficer is annually elected by the Jury, and that his office is in the\r\nnature of Sheriff of the Manor; that to him all the process of the Court\r\nis to be directed, and that it is his right and duty to summon all\r\nJuries to this court. And the Low Bailiff, at each fair, is entitled to\r\none penny for each stall or standing pitched in the said fairs.\"\r\n\r\n_The Office of High Bailiff_.--\"The Jury find and present that this\r\nOfficer is annually elected by the Jury; and that it is his duty to see\r\nthat the fairs be duly proclaimed, and that due order be preserved in\r\nthe fairs and markets; and if he sees any person in such fairs or\r\nmarkets using unlawful games, to the injury of ignorant persons and\r\nthoughtless youths, he may seize them and commit them to custody, to be\r\ntaken before a proper magistrate. That it is his duty to see that all\r\npersons exposing any wares for sale in the fairs or markets, or as\r\nshopkeepers within the manor, have legal weights and measures.\"\r\n\r\nThe other officers of the Court Leet, whose duties are also defined in\r\nthe aforesaid pamphlet, are the \"Constables,\" the \"Headborough,\" two\r\n\"Affeirers\" (who looked after the rents and dues belonging to the Lord\r\nof the Manor), two \"Leather Sealers\" (once important officers, when\r\nthere was a Leather Market, but whose duties in and about the year named\r\nseemed to be confined to attending at the yearly dinners given by the\r\nHigh Bailiff), two \"Ale-conners, otherwise high tasters,\" and two\r\n\"Flesh-conners, otherwise low tasters.\" From their name it might be\r\nthought the duties of the last named officers were limited to the\r\ninspection of meat or flesh, but it will be seen that they were of a\r\nmore comprehensive character:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Their duty is to see that all butchers, fishmongers, poulterers,\r\n  bakers, and other sellers of victuals, do not sell or expose to sale\r\n  within this Manor any unwholesome, corrupt, or contagious flesh, fish,\r\n  or other victuals; and in case any such be exposed to sale, we find\r\n  that the said Officers, by the ancient custom of the Manor may seize,\r\n  burn, or destroy the same, or otherwise present the offenders at the\r\n  next Court Leet to be holden for this Manor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we are now officered, inspectored and policed, and generally looked\r\nafter as to our eating and drinking, &c., in the most improved modern\r\nstyle possible, it is not necessary to further fill space by saying what\r\nthe \"Headborough\" had to do, or how many \"Constables\" assisted him. The\r\nlast meeting of the Court Leet, long shorn of all its honours and\r\nprivileges, was held October 28, 1851.\r\n\r\n~Court Of Record.~--This was also called the \"Mayor's Court,\" and was\r\nauthorised in the Charter of Incorporation for the recovery of small\r\ndebts under £20, the officers consisting of a Judge, Registrar, and two\r\nSergeants-at-Mace. In 1852 (Oct. 26) the Town Council petitioned the\r\nQueen to transfer its powers to the County Court, which was acceded to\r\nin the following spring.\r\n\r\n~Court of Requests.~--Constituted by Act of Parliament in 1752 this\r\nCourt for \"the more easy and speedy recovery of small debts within the\r\ntown of Birmingham and the adjoining hamlet of Deritend\" continued in\r\noperation until the present County Court system became the law of the\r\nland. Its powers were originally limited to debts not exceeding 40s. in\r\namount (which was increased to £5 by an Act passed in 1807), the periods\r\nof imprisonment to which defaulting debtors were liable being\r\napportioned out at the rate of one day in durance for each shilling due,\r\nexcept in special cases, wherein an addition (not to exceed three\r\nmonths) might be the reward for fraudulent concealment of property from\r\ncreditors. The \"Court\" consisted of no less than six dozen judges, or,\r\nas the Act styled them, \"Commissioners,\" from whose decisions there was\r\nno appeal whatever. These Commissioners were at first chosen from the\r\nratepayers in a haphazard style, no mental or property qualification\r\nwhatever being required, though afterwards it was made incumbent that\r\nthey should be possessed of an income from real estate to value of £50\r\nper year, or be worth £1,000 personalty. From the writings of William\r\nHutton, himself one of the Commissioners, and other sources, we gather\r\nthat justice, or what was supposed to be equivalent thereto, was\r\nadministered in a rough-and-ready fashion of the rudest kind, the cases\r\nbeing frequently disposed of at the rate of thirty to forty per hour,\r\nand when we consider that imprisonment resulted at an average of one\r\ncase in ten the troubles attendant upon impecuniosity in those days may\r\nbe better imagined then described. The Court House, which is now\r\noccupied by sundry tradesmen, lay a little back from High-street, nearly\r\nopposite New-street, and in itself was no mean structure, having been\r\n(it is said), erected about the year 1650, as the town house of John\r\nJennens, or Jennings, one of the wealthy family, the claims to whose\r\nestates have been unending, as well as unprofitable, barring, of course,\r\nto the long-robed and bewigged fraternity. A narrow passage from the\r\nright of the entrance hall leads by a dark winding staircase to the\r\ncellars, now filled with merchandise, but which formerly constituted the\r\ndebtors' prison, or, as it was vulgarly called, \"The Louse Hole,\" and\r\ndoubtless from its frequently-crowded and horribly-dirty condition, with\r\nhalf-starved, though often debauched and dissipated, occupants, the\r\nnasty name was not inappropriately given. Shocking tales have been told\r\nof the scenes and practices here carried on, and many are still living\r\nwho can recollect the miserable cry of \"Remember the poor debtors,\"\r\nwhich resounded morning, noon, and night from the heavily-barred windows\r\nof these underground dungeons. The last batch of unfortunates here\r\nconfined were liberated August 16, 1844.\r\n\r\n~Creche.~--An institution which has been open in Bath Row for several\r\nyears, and a great blessing to many poor mothers in its neighbourhood,\r\nbut it is so little known that it has not met with the support it\r\ndeserves, and is therefore crippled in its usefulness for want of more\r\nsubscribers. The object of the institution is to afford, during the\r\ndaytime, shelter, warmth, food, and good nursing to the infants and\r\nyoung children of poor mothers who are compelled to be from home at\r\nwork. This is done at the small charge of 2d. per day--a sum quite\r\ninadequate to defray the expenses of the charity. The average number of\r\nchildren so sheltered is about 100 per week, and the number might be\r\ngreatly increased if there were more funds. Gifts of coal, blankets,\r\nlinen, perambulators, toys, pictures, &c., are greatly valued, and\r\nsubscriptions and donations will be gladly received by the hon.\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\n~Crescent,~ Cambridge Street.--When built it was thought that the\r\ninhabitants of the handsome edifices here erected would always have an\r\nextensive view over gardens and green fields, and certainly if chimney\r\npots and slated roofs constitute a country landscape the present\r\ndenizens cannot complain. The ground belongs to the Grammar School, the\r\ngovernors of which leased it in 1789 to Mr. Charles Norton, for a term\r\nof 120 years, at a ground rent of £155 10s. per year, the lessee to\r\nbuild 34 houses and spend £12,000 thereon; the yearly value now is about\r\n£1,800. On the Crescent Wharf is situated the extensive stores of\r\nMessrs. Walter Showell & Sons, from whence the daily deliveries of\r\nCrosswells Ales are issued to their many Birmingham patrons. Here may be\r\nseen, stacked tier upon tier, in long cool vistas, close upon 6,000\r\ncasks of varying sizes containing these celebrated ales, beers, and\r\nstouts. This stock is kept up by daily supplies from the brewery at\r\nLangley Green, many boats being employed in the traffic.\r\n\r\n~Cricket.~--See \"_Sports_.\"\r\n\r\n~Crime.~--A few local writers like to acknowledge that Birmingham is any\r\nworse than other large towns in the matter of crime and criminals, and\r\nthe old adage respecting the bird that fouls its own nest has been more\r\nthan once applied to the individuals who have ventured to demur from the\r\nboast that ours is _par excellence_, a highly moral, fair-dealing,\r\nsober, and superlatively honest community. Notwithstanding the character\r\ngiven it of old, and the everlasting sneer that is connected with the\r\nterm \"Brummagem,\" the fast still remains that our cases of drunkenness\r\nare far less than in Liverpool, our petty larcenies fewer than in Leeds,\r\nour highway robberies about half compared with Manchester, malicious\r\ndamage a long way under Sheffield, and robberies from the person not\r\nmore than a third of those reported in Glasgow; while as to smashing and\r\ncoining, though it has been flung at us from the time of William of\r\nOrange to the present day; that all the bad money ever made _must_ be\r\nmanufactured here, the truth is that five-sixths of the villainous crew\r\nwho deal in that commodity obtain their supplies from London, and _not_\r\nfrom our little \"hardware village.\" But alas! there _is_ a dark side to\r\nthe picture, indeed, for, according to the Registrar-General's return of\r\nJune, 1879 (and the proportionate ratio, we are sorry to say, still\r\nremains the same), Birmingham holds the unenviable position of being the\r\ntown where most deaths from violence occur, the annual rate per 1,000\r\nbeing 1.08 in Birmingham, 0.99 in Liverpool, 0.38in Sheffield, 0.37 in\r\nPortsmouth, the average for the kingdom being even less than that--\"the\r\nproportional fatality from violence being almost invariably more than\r\ntwice as large in Birmingham as in Sheffield.\"\r\n\r\n~Cross.~--In the Bull Ring, when Hutton first came here, a poor wayfarer\r\nseeking employ, there was a square building standing on arches called\r\n\"The Cross,\" or \"Market Cross,\" the lower part giving a small shelter to\r\nthe few countrywomen who brought their butter and eggs to market, while\r\nthe chamber above provided accommodation for meetings of a public\r\ncharacter. When the Corn Cheaping, the Shambles, and all the other\r\nheterogeneous collection of tumbledown shanties and domiciles which in\r\nthe course of centuries had been allowed to gather round St. Martin's\r\nwere cleared away, the Market Cross was demolished, and its exact site\r\nis hardly ascertainable. At Dale End there was a somewhat similar\r\nerection known as the \"Welsh Cross,\" taking its peculiar name, says\r\nHutton, from the locality then called \"Welsh End,\" on account of the\r\nnumber of Welsh people living on that side of the town; though why the\r\n\"Taffies\" were honoured with a distinct little market house of their own\r\nis not made clear. This building was taken down in 1803, the 3-dial\r\nclock, weathercock, &c., being advertised for sale, October 12, 1802.\r\n\r\n~Crown.~--The old Crown Inn, Deritend, is one of the very few specimens\r\nwe have of the style of architecture adopted in the days of old, when\r\ntimber was largely used in place of our modern bricks. Leland mentions\r\nthe Crown Inn as existing in 1538, and a much longer history than that\r\nis claimed for it. In 1817 there was another Old Crown Inn in New\r\nStreet, on the spot where Hyam's now stands, access to the Cherry\r\nOrchard being had through its yard, the right of way thus obtained being\r\nthe origin of the present Union Passage.\r\n\r\n~Crystal Palaces.~--It was proposed in August, 1853, that the\r\nCorporation should join with the Midland Railway Co. and the Corporation\r\nof Sutton in the erection of a \"Sydenham Palace\" in Sutton Park:\r\nBirmingham to lease 250 acres for 999 years, at 1s. per acre, find from\r\n£20,000 to £30,000 for the building and divide profits, the Midland\r\nRailway Co. being willing to make branch from Bromford and run cheap\r\ntrains. The scheme was highly approved, but the Suttonites killed the\r\ngoose that was to lay them such golden eggs by refusing to lease the\r\nland for more than ninety-nine years and wanting 20s. per acre rent. In\r\nJuly, 1877, a \"Sutton Park Crystal Palace Co. (Lim.)\" was registered,\r\nwith a capital of £25,000 in £5 shares, for buying Mr. Cole's Promenade\r\nGardens, erecting Hotel, Aquarium, Skating Rink, Concert Hall, Winter\r\nGardens, &c., and the shares were readily taken up. Additional grounds\r\nwere purchased, and though the original plans have not yet been all\r\ncarried out, a very pleasant resort is to be found there. Day's, in\r\nSmallbrook Street, is also called a \"Crystal Palace,\" on account of the\r\nstyle of decoration, and the immense mirror the proprietor purchased\r\nfrom the Hyde Park Exhibition of 1851.\r\n\r\n~Curzon Hall~, built originally for the purposes of the Dog Shows, was\r\nopened in 1865. It is the property of a company, and cost about £7,500.\r\nThe building is well suited and has been often used for exhibitions,\r\npanoramas, circus entertainments, &c., the hall being 103 ft. long by 91\r\nft. wide; the stage is of the fullest width, with a depth of 45 ft.\r\nThere is room for 3,000 seats.\r\n\r\n~Danielites.~--A tribe who eschew fish, flesh, and fowl, and drink no\r\nalcohol; neither do they snuff, smoke, or chew tobacco. At a fruit\r\nbanquet, held on August, 1877, it was decided to organise a \"Garden of\r\nDanielites\" in Birmingham.\r\n\r\n~Dates.~--The most complete work giving the dates of all the leading\r\nevents in the world's history is \"Haydn's Book of Dates,\" the latest\r\nedition bringing them down to 1882. For local events, the only \"Local\r\nBook of Dates\" published is that of 1874, but \"Showell's Dictionary of\r\nBirmingham\" (by the same author), will be found to contain more reliable\r\ndata than any book hitherto issued. For information of a general\r\ncharacter, respecting the immediate neighbourhood and adjoining\r\ncounties, our readers cannot do better than refer to the files of\r\nBirmingham newspapers, preserved in the Reference Library, or write to\r\nthe present editors of the said papers, gentlemen noted for their\r\nurbanity, and readiness to tell anybody anything.\r\n\r\n~Dawson,~ George, _See \"Parsons, Preachers, and Priests_,\" and\r\n\"_Statues_.\"\r\n\r\n~Deaf and Dumb Asylum.~--_See \"Philanthropic Institutions_.\"\r\n\r\n~Debating Societies.~--From time immemorial the Brums have had their\r\nlittle Parliaments, mostly in public-house parlours and clubrooms, and\r\ncertain Sunday nights gathering at \"Bob Edmonds\" and other well-known\r\nhouses have acquired quite an historical interest; but the\r\nregularly-constituted \"Spouting Clubs\" of the present day cannot claim a\r\nvery long existence, the Birmingham Debating Society having held their\r\nfirst palaver on the 3rd of Dec., 1846. In 1855 they joined the\r\nEdgbastonians. The latest of the kind started in 1884, is known as the\r\nBirmingham Parliamentary Debating Society, and has its premier, parties,\r\nand political fights, in proper Parliamentary style.\r\n\r\n~Deer Stealers.~--There was a taste for venison in more classes than one\r\nin 1765, for it was found necessary to offer rewards for the detection\r\nof those persons who stole the deer from Aston Park.\r\n\r\n~Dental Hospital.~--_See \"Hospitals_.\"\r\n\r\n~Deodands.~--Prior to the passing of 9 and 10 Vict., 1846, Coroner's\r\nJuries had the power of imposing a \"deodand\" or penalty on any article\r\nor animal which had been instrumental in causing the death of a human\r\nbeing, the said animal or article being forfeited if the owner did not\r\npay.\r\n\r\n~Deritend.~--In some antique records the name has been spelt\r\n\"Duratehend.\" For this and other reasons it has been thought to have had\r\nits origin rather from the ancient British, as \"dur\" is still the Welsh\r\nword for water, and its situation on the Rea (a Gaelic word signifying a\r\nrunning stream) seems to give a little foundation therefor. Mr. Tonlmin\r\nSmith, in whose family the \"Old Crown House\" has descended from the time\r\nit was built, and who, therefore, is no mean authority, was of opinion\r\nthat the name was formerly \"Der-yat-end,\" or \"Deer-Gate-End,\" from the\r\nbelief that in ancient days there was here an ancient deer forest.\r\nLeland said he entered the town by \"Dirtey,\" so perhaps after all\r\nDeritend only means \"the dirty end.\" Like the name of the town itself,\r\nas well as several other parts of it, we can only guess at the origin.\r\n\r\n~Deritend Bridge.~--Old records show that some centuries back there was\r\na bridge here of some sort, and occasionally we find notes of payments\r\nmade for repairs to the roads leading to the gates of the bridge, or to\r\nthe watchmen who had charge thereof, who appear to have been in the\r\nhabit of locking the gates at night, a procedure which we fear our\r\n\"Dirtyent\" neighbours of to-day would be inclined to resent. The Act for\r\nbuilding the present bridge was obtained in 1784; the work was commenced\r\nin 1789, but not completed till 1814.\r\n\r\n~Dickens,~ Charles, made his first appearance amongst us at a\r\nPolytechnic Conversazione held February 28, 1844, his last visit being\r\nto distribute prizes to students of the Midland Institute, January 6,\r\n1870. In December, 1854, he gave the proceeds of three \"Readings,\"\r\namounting to £227, to the funds of the Institute, in which he always\r\ntook great interest.--_See also \"Theatrical Notes,\" &c._\r\n\r\n~Digbeth,~ or Dyke Path, or Ducks' Bath, another puzzle to the\r\nantiquarians. It was evidently a watery place, and the pathway lay low,\r\nas may be seen at \"Ye Olde Leather Bottel.\"\r\n\r\n~Dining Halls.~--Our grandfathers were content to take their bread and\r\ncheese by the cosy fireside of a public-house kitchen; this was followed\r\nby sundry publicans reserving a better room, in which a joint was served\r\nup for their \"topping customers.\" One who got into trouble and lost his\r\nlicense, conceived the idea of opposing his successor, and started\r\ndining-rooms, sending out for beer as it was required, but _not_ to his\r\nold shop. This innovation took, and when the railways began bringing in\r\ntheir streams of strangers, these dining-rooms paid well (as several of\r\nthe old ones do still). The next step was the opening of a large room in\r\nSlaney Street (June 8, 1863), and another in Cambridge Street, with the\r\nimposing title of \"Dining Halls,\" wherein all who were hungry could be\r\nfed at wholesale prices--provided they had the necessary cash. Our\r\npeople, however, are not sufficiently gregarious to relish this kind of\r\nfeeding in flocks, barrackroom fashion, and though the provisions were\r\ngood and cheap, the herding together of all sorts spoilt the\r\nspeculation, and Dining Halls closed when \"Restaurants\" opened.--See\r\n\"_Luncheon Bars_.\"\r\n\r\n~Diocese.~--Birmingham is in the diocese of Worcester, and in the\r\nArchdeaconry of Coventry.\r\n\r\n~Directories.~--The oldest Birmingham Directory known was printed in\r\n1770, but there had been one advertised a few years earlier, and every\r\nnow and then, after this date one or other of our few printers ventured\r\nto issue what they called a directory, but the procuring a complete list\r\nof all and every occupation carried on in Birmingham appears to have\r\nbeen a feat beyond their powers, even sixty years back. As far as they\r\ndid go, however, the old directories are not uninteresting, as they give\r\nus glimpses of trade mutations and changes compared with the present\r\ntime that appear strange now even to our oldest inhabitants. Place for\r\ninstance the directory of 1824 by the side of White's directory for 1874\r\n(one of the most valuable and carefully compiled works of the kind yet\r\nissued). In the former we find the names of 4,980 tradesmen, the\r\ndifferent businesses under which they are allotted numbering only 141;\r\nin 1874 the trades and professions named tot up to 745, under which\r\nappears no less than 33,462 names. In 1824, if we are to believe the\r\ndirectory, there were no factors here, no fancy repositories, no\r\ngardeners or florists, no pearl button makers, no furniture brokers or\r\npawnbrokers (!), no newsagents, and, strange to say, no printer.\r\nPhotographers and electro-platers were unknown, though fifty years after\r\nshowed 68 of the one, and 77 of the latter. On the other hand, in 1824,\r\nthere were 78 auger, awlblade and gimlet makers, against 19 in 1874; 14\r\nbellows makers, against 5; 36 buckle and 810 button makers, against 10\r\nand 265; 52 edge tool makers and 176 locksmiths, against 18 of each in\r\n1874; hinge-makers were reduced from 53 to 23; gilt toy makers, from 265\r\nto 15. (Considering the immense quantity of gilt trifles now sent out\r\nyearly, we can only account for these figures by supposing the producers\r\nto have been entered under various other headings). Among the trades\r\nthat have vanished altogether, are steelyard makers, of whom there were\r\n19 in 1824; saw-makers, of whom there were 26; tool-makers, of whom\r\nthere were 79, and similorers, whatever they might have been. Makers of\r\nthe time-honoured snuffers numbered 46 in 1824, and there were even\r\nhalf-a-dozen manufacturers left at work in 1874. The introduction of\r\ngas-lighting only found employ, in the first-named year, for three\r\ngasfitters; in 1874, there were close upon 100. Pewterers and\r\nmanufacturers of articles in Britannia metal numbered 75 in 1824,\r\nagainst 19 in 1874, wire-drawers in the same period coming down from 237\r\nto 56. The Directories of the past ten years have degenerated into mere\r\nbulky tomes, cataloguing names certainly, but published almost solely\r\nfor the benefit (?) of those tradesmen who can be coaxed into\r\nadvertising in their pages. To such an extent has this been carried,\r\nthat it is well for all advertisers to be careful when giving their\r\norders, that they are dealing with an established and respectable firm,\r\nmore than one bogus Directory having come under the notice of the writer\r\nduring the past year or two. The issue of a real Post Office Directory\r\nfor 1882, for which the names, trades, and addresses were to be gathered\r\nby the letter-carriers, and no body of men could be more suitable for\r\nthe work, or be better trusted, was hailed by local tradesmen as a\r\ndecided step in advance (though little fault could be found with the\r\neditions periodically issued by Kelly), but unfortunately the proposed\r\nplan was not successfully carried out, and in future years the volume\r\nwill be principally valued as a curiosity, the wonderfully strange\r\nmistakes being made therein of placing the honoured name of Sir Josiah\r\nMason under the head of \"Next-of-Kin Enquiry Agents,\" and that, too,\r\njust previous to the exposure of the numerous frauds carried out by one\r\nof the so-called agents and its curiousness is considerably enhanced by\r\nthe fact that a like error had been perpetrated in a recent edition of\r\nKelly's Directory.\r\n\r\n~Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society~ in 1882 gave assistance to 642\r\npersons, at an average cost of 9s. 9-1/2d. each--£315 19s. 4d. £161 16s.\r\n5d. of this amount came from the convicts' gratuities, while the cost of\r\naiding and helping them took £192 2s.\r\n\r\n~Dispensary.~--Established in 1794; the first stone of the building in\r\nUnion Street was laid December 23, 1806, and it was opened for the\r\nreception of patients early in 1808, the cost being about £3,000. It has\r\nbeen one of the most valuable institutions of the town, thousands\r\nreceiving medical assistance every year, and is supported by voluntary\r\nsubscriptions. A branch Dispensary was opened in Monument Road, Feb. 27,\r\n1884. Provident Dispensaries, to which members pay a small monthly sum\r\nfor medicine and attendance, were organised in 1878, the first branch\r\nbeing opened at Hockley in October of that year. In the first fifteen\r\nmonths 3,765 individuals, paid subscriptions, and about £577 was paid\r\nfor drugs and doctors fees. There are also branches at Camp Hill and\r\nSmall Heath.\r\n\r\n~Dissenters.~--In 1836 there were 45 places of worship belonging to\r\nvarious denominations of Dissenters here; there are now about 145.--_See\r\n\"Places of Worship_.\"\r\n\r\n~Distances~ from Birmingham to neighbouring places, county towns, trade\r\ncentres, watering places, &c.

1796 \"the fields and waters near the town\r\nwere covered with the dead carcases of dogs destroyed by their owners to\r\navoid payment of the tax.\" The amount paid per year at present for \"dog\r\nlicenses\" in Birmingham is about £1,800. The using of dogs as beasts of\r\nburden (common enough now abroad) was put a stop to in London at the end\r\nof Oct. 1840, though it was not until 1854 that the prohibition became\r\ngeneral. Prior to the passing of the Act in that year, dogs were\r\nutilised as draught animals to a very great extent in this neighbourhood\r\nby the rag-and-bone gatherers, pedlars, and little merchants, as many as\r\n180 of the poor brutes once being counted in five hours as passing a\r\ncertain spot on the Westbromwich Road. There have been one or two\r\n\"homes\" for stray dogs opened, but it is best in case of a loss of this\r\nkind to give early information at the nearest police station, as the art\r\nof dog stealing has latterly been much cultivated in this town, and it\r\nshould be considered a duty to one's neighbour to aid in putting a stop\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\n~Dog Shows.~--The first local Dog Show was held in 1860, but it was not\r\nuntil the opening in Curzon Hall, December 4, 1865, that the Show took\r\nrank as one of the \"yearly institutions\" of the town.--See\r\n\"_Exhibitions_.\"\r\n\r\n~Domesday Books.~--The so-called Domesday Book, compiled by order of\r\nWilliam the Norman Conqueror, has always been considered a wonderful\r\nwork, and it must have taken some years compiling. Some extracts\r\ntouching upon the holders of land in this neighbourhood have already\r\nbeen given, and in a sense they are very interesting, showing as they do\r\nthe then barrenness of the land, and the paucity of inhabitants. Though\r\nin Henry VIII.'s reign an inventory of all properties in the hands of\r\nChurchmen was taken, it did not include the owners of land in general,\r\nand it was not till Mr. John Bright in 1873 moved for the Returns, that\r\na complete register of the kind was made. It would not be easy, even if\r\nspace could be given to it, to give the list of individuals, companies,\r\nand corporation who claim to be possessors of the land we live on in\r\nBirmingham and neighbourhood; but a summary including the owners in this\r\nand adjoining counties may be worth preserving. As will be seen by the\r\nannexed figures, Warwick and Stafford rank high in the list of counties\r\nhaving large numbers of small owners (small as to extent of ground,\r\nthough often very valuable from the erections thereon). There can be no\r\ndoubt that the Freehold Land and Building Societies have had much to do\r\nwith this, and as Birmingham was for years the headquarters of these\r\nSocieties, the fact of there being nearly 47,000 persons in the county\r\n(out of a total population of 634,189) who own small plots under one\r\nacre, speaks well for the steady perseverance of the Warwickshire lads.\r\nThat we are not wrong in coming to this conclusion is shown by the fact\r\nthat leaving out the Metropolitan Counties, Warwick heads, in this\r\nrespect, all the shires in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  WARWICKSHIRE.\r\n                                 Extent   Gross\r\n                                   of   estimated\r\n                                 lands.   rental.\r\n  Owners of              Numbr.

In\r\n1331 Simon del Holte, styled of Birmingham, purchased the manor of\r\nNechells \"in consideration of xl _li_ of silver.\" In 1365 John atte\r\nHolte purchased for \"forty marks\" the manor of Duddeston, and two years\r\nlater he became possessed by gift of the manor of Aston. For many\r\ngenerations the family residence was at Duddeston, though their burial\r\nplace was at Aston, in which church are many of their monuments, the\r\noldest being that of Wm. Holte, who died September 28, 1514. That the\r\nHoltes, though untitled, were men of mark, may be seen by the brass in\r\nthe North Aisle of Aston Church to the memory of Thomas Holte, \"Justice\r\nof North Wales, and Lord of this town of Aston,\" who died March 23,\r\n1545. His goods and chattels at his death were valued at £270 6s. 2d.--a\r\nvery large sum in those days, and from the inventory we find that the\r\nHall contained thirteen sleeping apartments, viz., \"the chambur over the\r\nbuttrie, the chappel chambur, the maydes' chambur, the great chambur,\r\nthe inner chambur, to the great chambur, the yatehouse chambur, the\r\ninner chambur to the same, the geston chambur, the crosse chambur, the\r\ninner chambur to the same, the clark's chambur the yoemen's chambur, and\r\nthe hyne's chambur.\" The other apartments were \"the hawle, the plece,\r\nthe storehouse, the galarye, the butterye, the ketchyn, the larderhowse,\r\nthe dey-howse, the bakhowse, the bultinge howse, and the yeling howse,\"\r\n--the \"chappell\" being also part of the Hall. The principal bedrooms\r\nwere hung with splendid hangings, those of the great chamber being \"of\r\ngaye colors, blewe and redde,\" the other articles in accordance\r\ntherewith, the contents of this one room being valued at xiij li. xiv.\r\ns. iiijd. (£13 14s. 4d.) The household linen comprised \"22 damaske and\r\ntwo diapur table clothes\" worth 4s.; ten dozen table napkins (40s.); a\r\ndozen \"fyne towells,\" 20s.; a dozen \"course towells\" 6s. 8d.; thirty\r\npair \"fyne shetes\" £5; twenty-three pair \"course shetes\" £3; and\r\ntwenty-six \"pillow beres\" 20/-. The kitchen contained \"potts, chafornes,\r\nskymmers, skellets, cressets, gredires, frying pannys, chfying dishes, a\r\nbrazon morter with a pestell, stone morters, strykinge knives, broches,\r\nracks, brandards, cobberds, pot-hangings, hocks, a rack of iron, bowles,\r\nand payles.\" The live stock classed among the \"moveable goods, consisted\r\nof 19 oxen, 28 kyne, 17 young beste, 24 young calves, 12 gots, 4\r\ngeldings, 2 mares, 2 naggs and a colte, 229 shepe, 12 swyne, a crane, a\r\nturkey cok, and a henne with 3 chekyns\"--the lot being valued at £86 0s.\r\n8d. Sir Thomas's marriage with a daughter of the Winnington's brought\r\nmuch property into the family, including lands, &c., \"within the townes,\r\nvillages, and fields of Aston, next Byrmyngham, and Wytton, Mellton\r\nMowlberye (in Leicestershire), Hanseworthe (which lands did late belonge\r\nto the dissolved chambur of Aston), and also the Priory, or Free\r\nChappell of Byrmyngham, with the lands and tenements belonging thereto,\r\nwithin Byrmyngham aforesaid, and the lordship or manor of the same,\r\nwithin the lordship of Dudeston, together with the lands and tenements,\r\nwithin the lordship of Nechells, Salteley, sometime belonging to the\r\nlate dissolved Guild of Derytenne,\" as well as lands at \"Horborne,\r\nHaleshowen, Norfielde and Smithewicke.\" His son Edward, who died in\r\n1592, was succeeded by Sir Thomas Holte (born in 1571; died December,\r\n1654), and the most prominent member of the family. Being one of the\r\ndeputation to welcome James I. to England, in 1603, he received the\r\nhonour of knighthood; in 1612 he purchased an \"Ulster baronetcy,\" at a\r\ncost of £1,095 [this brought the \"red hand\" into his shield]; and in\r\n1599 he purchased the rectory of Aston for nearly £2,000. In April,\r\n1618, he commenced the erection of Aston Hall, taking up his abode there\r\nin 1631, though it was not finished till April, 1635. In 1642 he was\r\nhonoured with the presence of Charles I., who stopped at the Hall Sunday\r\nand Monday, October 16 and 17. [At the battle of Edge Hill Edward Holt,\r\nthe eldest son, was wounded--he died from fever on Aug. 28, 1643, during\r\nthe siege of Oxford, aged 43] The day after Christmas, 1643, the old\r\nsquire was besieged by about 1,200 Parliamentarians from Birmingham\r\n(with a few soldiers), but having procured forty musketeers from Dudley\r\nCastle, he held the Hall till the third day, when, having killed sixty\r\nof his assailants and lost twelve of his own men, he surrendered. The\r\nHall was plundered and he was imprisoned, and what with fines,\r\nconfiscations, and compounding, his loyalty appears to have cost him\r\nnearly £20,000. Sir Thomas had 15 children, but outlived them all save\r\none. He was succeeded in his title by his grandson, Sir Robert, who\r\nlived in very straightened circumstances, occasioned by the family's\r\nlosses during the Civil War, but by whose marriage with the daughter of\r\nLord Brereton the Cheshire property came to his children. He died Oct.\r\n3, 1679, aged 54, and was followed by Sir Charles, who had twelve\r\nchildren and lived till June 15, 1722, his son, Sir Clobery, dying in a\r\nfew years after (Oct. 24, 1729). Sir Lister Holte, the next baronet, had\r\nno issue, though twice married, and he was succeeded (April 8, 1770), by\r\nhis brother, Sir Charles, with whom the title expired (March 12, 1782),\r\nthe principal estates going with his daughter and only child, to the\r\nBracebridge family, as well as a dowry of £20,000. In 1817, an Act of\r\nParliament was obtained for the settlement and part disposal of the\r\nwhole of the property of this time-honoured and wealthy family--the\r\ntotal acreage being 8,914a. 2r. 23p, and the then annual rental £16,557\r\nOs. 9d.--the Aston estate alone extending from Prospect Row to beyond\r\nErdington Hall, and from Nechells and Saltley to the Custard House and\r\nHay Mill Brook. Several claims have been put forward by collateral\r\nbranches, both to the title and estates, but the latter were finally\r\ndisposed of in 1849, when counsel's opinion was given in favour of the\r\nsettlements made by Sir Lister Holte, which enabled the property to be\r\ndisposed of. The claimants to the title have not yet proved their title\r\nthereto, sundry registers and certificates of ancient baptisms and\r\nmarriages being still wanting.\r\n\r\n~Duddeston Ward Hall.~--The name tells what it is for. The first stone\r\nwas laid Dec. 15, 1877; it was opened June 1, 1878; will seat about 300,\r\nand cost £3,500, which was found by a limited Co.\r\n\r\n~Dungeon.~--This very appropriate name was given to the old gaol\r\nformerly existing in Peck Lane. A writer, in 1802, described it as a\r\nshocking place, the establishment consisting of one day room, two\r\nunderground dungeons (in which sometimes half-a-dozen persons had to\r\nsleep), and six or seven night-rooms, some of them constructed out of\r\nthe Gaoler's stables. The prisoners were allowed 4d. per day for bread\r\nand cheese, which they had to buy from the keeper, who, having a beer\r\nlicense, allowed outsiders to drink with his lodgers. This, and the fact\r\nthat there was but one day room for males and females alike, leaves but\r\nlittle to be imagined as to its horrible, filthy condition. Those who\r\ncould afford to pay 2s. 6d. a week were allowed a bed in the gaoler's\r\nhouse, but had to put up with being chained by each wrist to the sides\r\nof the bedsteads all night, and thus forced to lie on their backs. The\r\npoor wretches pigged it in straw on the floors of the night rooms. See\r\nalso \"_Gaols_\" and \"_Prisons_.\"\r\n\r\n~Dwarfs.~--The first note we have of the visit here of one of these\r\ncuriosities of mankind is that of Count Borulawski, in 1783: though but\r\n39 inches high it is recorded that he had a sister who could stand under\r\nhis arm. The next little one, Manetta Stocker, a native of Austria, came\r\nhere in 1819, and remained with us, there being a tombstone in St.\r\nPhilip's churchyard bearing this inscription:--\r\n\r\n  In Memory of MANETTA STOCKER,\r\n  Who quitted this life the fourth day of May, 1819,\r\n  at the age of  thirty-nine years.\r\n  The smallest woman in this kingdom,\r\n  and one of the most accomplished.\r\n  She was not more than thirty-three inches high.\r\n  She was a native of Austria.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tom Thumb (Charles Stratton) was exhibited at Dee's Royal\r\nHotel, in September, 1844, when he was about ten years old, and several\r\ntimes after renewed the acquaintance. He was 31 inches high, and was\r\nmarried to Miss Warren, a lady of an extra inch. The couple had\r\noffspring, but the early death of the child put an end to Barnum's\r\nattempt to create a race of dwarfs. Tom Thumb died in June 1883. General\r\nMite who was exhibited here last year, was even smaller than Tom Thumb,\r\nbeing but 21 inches in height. Birmingham, however, need not send abroad\r\nfor specimens of this kind, \"Robin Goodfellow\" chronicling the death on\r\nNov. 27, 1878, of a poor unfortunate named Thomas Field, otherwise the\r\n\"Man-baby,\" who, though twenty-four years of age, was but 30 inches high\r\nand weighed little over 20lbs., and who had never walked or talked. The\r\ncurious in such matters may, on warm, sunny mornings, occasionally meet,\r\nin the neighbourhood of Bromsgrove Street, a very intelligent little man\r\nnot much if any bigger than the celebrated Tom Thumb, but who has never\r\nbeen made a show of.\r\n\r\n~Dynamite Manufacture.~--See \"_Notable Offences_.\"\r\n\r\n~Ear and Throat Infirmary.~--See \"_Hospitals_.\"\r\n\r\n~Earthquakes~ are not of such frequent occurrence in this country as to\r\nrequire much notice. The first we find recorded (said to be the greatest\r\nknown here) took place in November, 1318; others were felt in this\r\ncountry in May, 1332; April, 1580; November, 1775; November, 1779;\r\nNovember, 1852, and October, 1863.\r\n\r\n~Easy Row,~ or Easy Hill, as Baskerville delighted to call the spot he\r\nhad chosen for a residence. When Mr. Hanson was planning out the Town\r\nHall, there were several large elm trees still standing in Easy Row, by\r\nthe corner of Edmund Street, part of the trees which constituted\r\nBaskerville's Park, and in the top branches of which the rooks still\r\nbuilt their nests. The entrance to Broad Street had been narrow, and\r\nbounded by a lawn enclosed with posts and chains, reaching to the elm\r\ntrees, but the increase of traffic had necessitated the removal (in\r\n1838) of the grassplots and the fencing, though the old trees were left\r\nuntil 1847, by which time they were little more than skeletons of trees,\r\nthe smoky atmosphere having long since stopped all growth.\r\n\r\n~Eccentrics.~--There are just a few now to be found, but in these days\r\nof heaven-sent artists and special-born politicians, it would be an\r\ninvidious task to chronicle their doings, or dilate on their peculiar\r\nidiosyncracies, and we will only note a few of the queer characters of\r\nthe past, leaving to the future historian the fun of laughing at our men\r\nof to-day. In 1828 the man of mark was \"Dandie Parker,\" a well-to-do\r\nseedsman, who, aping Beau Brummel in gait and attire, sought to be the\r\nleader of fashion. He was rivalled, a little while after, by one Meyers,\r\nto see whom was a sight worth crossing the town, so firm and spruce was\r\nhe in his favourite dress of white hat and white trousers, dark green or\r\nblue coat with gilt buttons, buff waistcoat, and stiff broad white\r\nneckcloth or stock, a gold-headed cane always in hand. By way of\r\ncontrast to these worthies, at about the same period (1828-30) was one\r\n\"Muddlepate Ward,\" the head of a family who had located themselves in a\r\ngravel pit at the Lozells, and who used to drive about the town with an\r\nold carriage drawn by pairs of donkeys and ponies, the harness being\r\ncomposed of odd pieces of old rope, and the whip a hedgestake with a bit\r\nof string, the whole turnout being as remarkable for dirt as the\r\nfirst-named \"dandies\" were for cleanliness.--\"Billy Button\" was another\r\nwell-known but most inoffensive character, who died here May 3, 1838.\r\nHis real name was never published, but he belonged to a good family, and\r\nearly in life he had been an officer in the Navy (some of his\r\nbiographers say \"a commander\"), but lost his senses when returning from\r\na long voyage, on hearing of the sudden death of a young lady to whom he\r\nwas to have been married, and he always answered to her name, Jessie. He\r\nwent about singing, and the refrain of one of his favourite songs--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Oysters, sir! Oysters, sir!\r\n     Oysters, sir, I cry;\r\n  They are the finest oysters, sir,\r\n     That ever you could buy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwas for years after \"Billy Button's\" death the nightly \"cry\" of more\r\nthan one peripatetic shellfishmonger. The peculiarity that obtained for\r\nthe poor fellow his _soubriquet_ of \"Billy Button\" arose from the habit\r\nhe had of sticking every button he could get on to his coat, which at\r\nhis death, was covered so thickly (and many buttons were of rare\r\npatterns), that it is said to have weighed over 30lbs.--\"Jemmy the\r\nRockman,\" who died here in September, 1866, in his 85th year, was\r\nanother well-known figure in our streets for many years. His real name\r\nwas James Guidney, and in the course of a soldier's life, he had seen\r\nstrange countries, and possibly the climates had not in every case\r\nagreed with him, for, according to his own account, he had been favoured\r\nwith a celestial vision, and had received angelic orders no longer to\r\nshave, &c. He obtained his living during the latter portion of his\r\nexistence by retailing a medicinal sweet, which he averred was good for\r\nall sorts of coughs and colds.--Robert Sleath, in 1788, was collector at\r\na turnpike gate near Worcester, and, 'tis said, made George III. and all\r\nhis retinue pay toll. He died here in November, 1804, when the following\r\nappeared in print:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"On Wednesday last, old Robert Sleath\r\n  Passed thro' the turnpike gate of Death,\r\n  To him Death would no toll abate\r\n  Who stopped the King at Wor'ster-gate.\"\r\n\r\n~Eclipses,~ more or less partial, are of periodical occurrence, though\r\nmany are not observed in this country. Malmesbury wrote of one in 1410,\r\nwhen people were so frightened that they ran out of their houses. Jan.\r\n12, 1679, there was an eclipse so complete that none could read at\r\nnoonday when it occurred. May 3, 1715, gave another instance, it being\r\nstated that the stars could be seen, and that the birds went to roost at\r\nmid-day. The last total eclipse of the sun observed by our local\r\nastronomers (if Birmingham had such \"plants\") occurred on May 22, 1724.\r\nAn account of the next one will be found in the _Daily Mail_, of August\r\n12, 1999. On August 17, 1868, there was an eclipse of the sun (though\r\nnot noticeable here) so perfect that its light was hidden for six\r\nminutes, almost the maximum possible interval, and it may be centuries\r\nbefore it occurs again.\r\n\r\n~Economy.~--Our grandfathers, and _their_ fathers, practised economy in\r\nevery way possible, even to hiring out the able-bodied poor who had to\r\nearn the cost of their keep by spinning worsted, &c., and they thought\r\nso much of the bright moonlight that they warehoused the oil lamps\r\nintended for lighting the streets for a week at a time when the moon was\r\nat its full, and never left them burning after eleven o'clock at other\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n~Edgbaston.~--The name as written in the earliest known deeds, was at\r\nfirst Celbaldston, altered as time went on to Eggebaldston, Eggebaston,\r\nand Edgbaston. How long the family held the manor before the Conquest is\r\nunknown; but when Domesday Book was written (1086), the occupying tenant\r\nwas one Drogo, who had two hides of land and half a mile of wood, worth\r\n20s.; 325 acres were set down as being cultivated, though there were\r\nonly ten residents. The Edgbastons held it from the lords of Birmingham,\r\nand they, in turn, from the lords of Dudley. Further than the family\r\nrecords the place has no history, only 100 years ago Calthorpe Road\r\nbeing nothing but a fieldpath, and Church Road, Vicarage Road, and\r\nWestbourne Road merely narrow lanes. After the opening up of these and\r\nother roads, building sites were eagerly sought by the more moneyed\r\nclass of our local magnates, and the number of inhabitants now are\r\nsufficient to people a fair-sized town. In 1801 the population was under\r\n1,000; in 1811, just over that number; in 1851, it was 9,269; in 1861,\r\n12,900; in 1871, 17,442, and on last census day, 29,951; showing an\r\nincrease of more than 1,000 a year at the present time; while what the\r\nrentals may amount to is only known inside \"the estate office.\" Some\r\nwriters say that the parish church dates from about the year 775. The\r\nearliest register book is that for 1635, which escaped the notice of\r\nCromwell's soldiers, who nearly destroyed the church in 1648; and from\r\nan entry in the register of St. Sepulchre's Church, Northampton, for\r\n1659, it would appear that there were collections made towards repairing\r\nthe damage done by those worthies. This entry quaintly states that\r\n\"seven shillings and sixpence\" was received towards the repairs of the\r\nchurch of Edge Barston, in the county of Warwick, adding also that there\r\nwas \"never a minister in the said parish.\"\r\n\r\n~Edgbaston Hall.~--The last of the Edgbastons was a lady by whose\r\nmarriage the Middlemores came into possession, and for nearly three\r\nhundred years the old house echoed the footsteps of their descendants.\r\nIn the troublous times of the Commonwealth, Edgbaston House and Church\r\nwere seized by Colonel John Fox, the latter building being used as a\r\nstable for his horses, and the former garrisoned by the soldiers kept\r\nthere to over-awe the gentry and loyal subjects of the country, to whom\r\n\"Tinker Fox,\" as he was dubbed, was a continual terror. This worthy\r\ncarried on so roughly that even the \"Committee of Safety\" (never\r\nparticularly noted for kindness or even honesty) were ashamed of him,\r\nand restored the place to its owner, Robert Middlemore, the last of the\r\nname. By the marriages of his two grand-daughters the estate was\r\ndivided, but the portion including the manor of Edgbaston was afterwards\r\npurchased by Sir Richard Gough, Knight, who gave £25,000 for it. In the\r\nmeantime the old house had been destroyed by those peace-loving Brums,\r\nwho, in December, 1688, razed to the ground the newly-built Catholic\r\nChurch and Convent in Masshouse Lane, their excuse being that they\r\nfeared the hated Papists would find refuge at Edgbaston. Sir Richard\r\n(who died February 9, 1727) rebuilt the Manor House and the Church in\r\n1717-18, and enclosed the Park. His son Henry was created a Baronet, and\r\nhad for his second wife the only daughter of Reginald Calthorpe, Esq.,\r\nof Elvetham, in Hampshire. Sir Henry Gough died June 8, 1774, and his\r\nwidow on the 13th of April, 1782, and on the latter event taking place,\r\ntheir son, who succeeded to the estates of both his parents, took his\r\nmother's family name of Calthorpe, and in 1796 was created a peer under\r\nthe title of Baron Calthorpe, of Calthorpe, county Norfolk. Edgbaston\r\nHall has not been occupied by any of the owners since the decease of\r\nLady Gough, 1782.\r\n\r\n~Edgbaston Pool~ covers an area of twenty-two acres, three roods, and\r\nthirty-six poles.\r\n\r\n~Edgbaston Street.~--One of the most ancient streets in the Borough,\r\nhaving been the original road from the parish church and the Manor-house\r\nof the Lords de Bermingham to their neighbours at Edgbaston. It was the\r\nfirst paved street of the town, and the chosen residence of the\r\nprincipal and most wealthy burgesses, a fact proved by its being known\r\nin King John's reign as \"Egebaston Strete,\" the worde \"strete\" in those\r\ndays meaning a paved way in cities or towns. This is further shown by\r\nthe small plots into which the land was divided and the number of owners\r\nnamed from time to time in ancient deeds, the yearly rentals, even in\r\nHenry VIII's time being from 3s. to 5s. per year. At the back of the\r\nlower side of Edgbaston Street, were several tanneries, there being a\r\nstream of water running from the moat round the Parsonage-house to the\r\nManor-house moat, the watercourse being now known as Dean Street and\r\nSmithfield Passage.\r\n\r\n~Electric Light.~--The light of the future. The first public exhibition\r\nof lighting by electricity, was introduced by Maccabe, a ventriloquial\r\nentertainer of the public, at the entrance of Curzon Hall, September 30,\r\n1878. On the 28th of the following month, the novelty appeared at the\r\nLower Grounds, on the occasion of a football match at night, the\r\nkick-off and lighting-up taking place at seven o'clock. At the last\r\nMusical Festival, the Town Hall was lit up by Messrs. Whitfield, of\r\nCambridge-street, and the novelty is no longer a rarity, a company\r\nhaving been formed to supply the houses, shops, and public buildings in\r\nthe centre of the town.\r\n\r\n~Electro Plate.~--As early as 1838, Messrs. Elkington were in the habit\r\nof coating ornaments with gold and silver by dipping them in various\r\nsolutions of those metals, and the first patent taken out for the\r\nelectro process appears to be that of July 6, 1838, for covering copper\r\nand brass with zinc. Mr. John Wright, a surgeon, of this town, was the\r\nfirst to use the alkaline cyanides, and the process was included in\r\nElkington's patent of March 25, 1840. The use of electricity from\r\nmagnets instead of the voltaic battery was patented by J.S. Wolrich, in\r\nAugust, 1842. His father was probably the first person who deposited\r\nmetals for any practical purpose by means of the galvanic battery. Mr.\r\nElkington applied the electro-deposit process to gilding and\r\nsilverplating in 1840.--See \"_Trades_,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Electoral Returns.~--See \"_Parliamentary_.\"\r\n\r\n~Emigration.~--In August, 1794, Mr. Russell, of Moor Green, and a\r\nmagistrate for the counties of Warwick and Worcester, with his two\r\nbrothers and their families, Mr. Humphries, of Camp Hill Villa, with a\r\nnumber of his relatives, and over a hundred other Birmingham families\r\nemigrated to America. Previous to this date we have no record of\r\nanything like an emigration movement from this town, though it is a\r\nmatter of history how strenuously Matthew Boulton and other\r\nmanufacturers exerted themselves to _prevent_ the emigration of artisans\r\nand workpeople, fearing that our colonies would be enriched at the\r\nexpense of the mother country. How sadly the times were changed in 1840,\r\nmay be imagined from the fact that when free passages to Australia were\r\nfirst being offered, no less than 10,000 persons applied unsuccessfully\r\nfrom this town and neighbourhood alone. At the present time it is\r\ncalculated that passages to America, Canada, Australia, &c., are being\r\ntaken up here at an average of 3,000 a year.\r\n\r\n~Erdington.~--Another of the ancient places (named in the Domesday Book\r\nas Hardingtone) surrounding Birmingham and which ranked as high in those\r\ndays of old, though now but like one of our suburbs, four miles on the\r\nroad to Sutton Coldfield. Erdington Hall, in the reign of Henry II., was\r\nthe moated and fortified abode of the family of that name, and their\r\nintermarriages with the De Berminghams, &c., connected them with our\r\nlocal history in many ways. Though the family, according to Dugdale and\r\nothers, had a chapel of their own, the hamlet appertained to the parish\r\nof Aston, to the mother church of which one Henry de Erdington added an\r\nisle, and the family arms long appeared in the heraldic tracery of its\r\nwindows. Erdington Church (St. Barnabas) was built in 1823, as a chapel\r\nof ease to Aston, and it was not until 1858 that the district was formed\r\ninto a separate and distinct ecclesiastical parish, the vicar of Aston\r\nbeing the patron of the living. In addition to the chapel at Oscott, the\r\nCatholics have here one of the most handsome places of worship in the\r\ndistrict, erected in 1850 at a cost of over £20,000, a Monastery, &c.,\r\nbeing connected therewith. Erdington, which has doubled its population\r\nwithin the last twenty years, has its Public Hall and Literary\r\nInstitute, erected in 1864, Police Station, Post Office, and several\r\nchapels, in addition to the almshouses and orphanage, erected by Sir\r\nJosiah Mason, noticed in another part of this work. See also\r\n\"_Population Tables_,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Estate Agents.~--For the purposes of general business, Kelly's\r\nDirectory will be found the best reference. The office for the Calthorpe\r\nestate is at 65 Hagley Road; for the William Dudley Trust estates, at\r\nImperial Chambers B, Colmore Row; for the Great Western Railway\r\nproperties at 103, Great Charles Street; for the Heathfield Estate in\r\nHeathfield Road, Handsworth; for the Horton (Isaac) properties at 41,\r\nColmore Row; Sir Joseph Mason's estate at the Orphanage, Erdington.\r\n\r\n~Exchange.~--Corner of Stephenson Place and New Street, having a\r\nfrontage of 64 feet to the latter, and 186 feet to the former. The\r\nfoundation stone was laid January 2, 1863, the architect being Mr.\r\nEdward Holmes, and the building was opened January 2, 1865, the original\r\ncost being a little under £20,000. It has since been enlarged (1876-78)\r\nto nearly twice the original size, under the direction of Mr. J.A.\r\nChatwin. The property and speculation of a private company, it was\r\n(December 2, 1880) incorporated, under the Joint Stock Companies' Act,\r\nand returns a fair dividend on the capital expended. In addition to the\r\nExchange and Chamber of Commerce proper, with the usual secretarial and\r\ncommittee rooms appertaining thereto, refreshment, billiard, and\r\nretiring rooms, &c., there is a large assembly-room, frequently used for\r\nballs, concerts, and entertainments of a public character. The\r\ndimensions of the principal hall are 70 feet length, 40 feet width, with\r\na height of 23 feet, the assembly-room above being same size, but\r\nloftier. The central tower is 110 feet high, the turret, in which there\r\nwas placed a clock made by John Inshaw, to be moved by electro-magnetic\r\npower (but which is now only noted for its incorrectness), rising some\r\n45 feet above the cornice. Other portions of the building are let off in\r\noffices.\r\n\r\n~Excise.~--It is but rarely the Inland Revenue authorities give the\r\npublic any information showing the amount of taxes gathered in by the\r\nofficials, and the return, therefore, for the year ending March 31,\r\n1879, laid before the House of Commons, is worth preserving, so far as\r\nthe Birmingham collection goes. The total sum which passed through the\r\nlocal office amounted to £89,321, the various headings under which the\r\npayments were entered, being:--Beer dealers, £2,245; beer retailers,\r\n£7,161; spirit dealers, £1,617; spirit retailers, £8,901; wine dealers,\r\n£874; wine retailers, £2,392; brewers, £9,518; maltsters, £408; dealers\r\nin roasted malt, £17; manufacturers of tobacco, £147; dealers in\r\ntobacco, £1,462; rectifiers of spirits, £11; makers of methylated\r\nspirits, £10; retailers of methylated spirits, £33; vinegar makers, £26;\r\nchemists and others using stills, £4; male servants, £1,094; dogs,\r\n£1,786; carriages, £4,613; armorial bearings, £374; guns, £116; to kill\r\ngame, £1,523; to deal in game, £136; refreshment houses, £366; makers\r\nand dealers in sweets, £18; retailers of sweets, £42; hawkers and\r\npedlars, £68; appraisers and house agents, £132; auctioneers, £1,210;\r\npawnbrokers, £1,958; dealers in plate, £1,749; gold and silver plate\r\nduty, £17,691; medicine vendors, £66; inhabited house duty, £21,533.\r\n\r\nThe Excise (or Inland Revenue) Offices are in Waterloo Street, and are\r\nopen daily from 10 to 4.\r\n\r\n~Excursions.~--The annual trip to the seaside, or the continent, or some\r\nother attractive spot, which has come to be considered almost an\r\nessential necessary for the due preservation of health and the\r\nsweetening of temper, was a thing altogether unknown to the old folks of\r\nour town, who, if by chance they could get as far as Lichfield,\r\nWorcester, or Coventry once in their lives, never ceased to talk about\r\nit as something wonderful. The \"outing\" of a lot of factory hands was an\r\nevent to be chronicled in _Aris's Gazette_, whose scribes duly noted the\r\nhorses and vehicles (not forgetting the master of the band, without whom\r\nthe \"gipsy party\" could not be complete), and the destination was seldom\r\nindeed further than the Lickey, or Marston Green, or at rarer intervals,\r\nSutton Coldfield or Hagley. Well-to-do tradesmen and employers of labour\r\nwere satisfied with a few hours spent at some of the old-style Tea\r\nGardens, or the Crown and Cushion, at Perry Barr, Aston Cross or Tavern,\r\nKirby's, or the New Inn, at Handsworth, &c. The Saturday half-holiday\r\nmovement, which came soon after the introduction of the railways, may be\r\nreckoned as starting the excursion era proper, and the first Saturday\r\nafternoon trip (in 1854) to the Earl of Bradford's, at Castle Bromwich,\r\nwas an eventful episode even in the life of George Dawson, who\r\naccompanied the trippites. The railway trips of the late past and\r\npresent seasons are beyond enumeration, and it needs not to be said that\r\nanyone with a little spare cash can now be whisked where'er he wills,\r\nfrom John-o'-Groats to the Land's End, for a less sum than our fathers\r\npaid to see the Shrewsbury Show, or Lady Godiva's ride at Coventry. As\r\nit was \"a new departure,\" and for future reference, we will note that\r\nthe first five-shilling Saturday-night-to-Monday-morning trip to\r\nLlandudno came off on August 14, 1880. The railway companies do not fail\r\nto give ample notice of all long excursions, and for those who prefer\r\nthe pleasant places in our own district, there is a most interesting\r\npublication to be had for 6d., entitled \"The Birmingham Saturday\r\nHalf-holiday Guide,\" wherein much valuable information is given\r\nrespecting the nooks and corners of Warwick and Worcester, and their\r\nhills and dales.\r\n\r\n~Executions.~--In 1729 a man was hung on Gibbett Hill, site of Oscott\r\nCollege, for murder and highway robbery. Catherine Evans was hung\r\nFebruary 8, 1742, for the murder of her husband in this town. At the\r\nSummer Assizes in 1773, James Duckworth, hopfactor and grocer, of this\r\ntown, was sentenced to death for counterfeiting and diminishing the gold\r\ncoin. He was supposed to be one of the heaviest men in the county,\r\nweighing over twenty-four stone. He died strongly protesting his\r\ninnocence, On the 22nd Nov., 1780, Wilfrid Barwick, a butcher, was\r\nrobbed and murdered near the four mile stone on the Coleshill Road. The\r\nculprits were two soldiers, named John Hammond (an American by birth)\r\nand Thomas Pitmore (a native of Cheshire) but well known as \"Jack and\r\nTom,\" drummer and fifer in the recruiting service here. They were\r\nbrought before the magistrates at the old Public Office in Dale End;\r\ncommitted; and in due course tried and sentenced at Warwick to be hanged\r\nand gibbeted on Washwood Heath, near the scene of the murder. The\r\nsentence was carried out April 2, 1781, the bodies hanging on the gibbet\r\nin chains a short time, until they were surreptitiously removed by some\r\nhumanitarian friends who did not approve of the exhibition. What became\r\nof the bodies was not known until the morning of Thursday, Jan. 20,\r\n1842, when the navvies employed on the Birmingham and Derby (now\r\nMidland) railway came upon the two skeletons still environed in chains\r\nwhen they were removing a quantity of earth for the embankment. The\r\nskeletons were afterwards reinterred under an apple-tree in the garden\r\nof the Adderley Arms, Saltley, and the gibbet-irons were taken as\r\nrarities to the Aston Tavern, where, possibly, inquisitive relic-mongers\r\nmay now see them. Four persons were hung for highway robbery near Aston\r\nPark, April 2, 1790. Seven men were hung at Warwick, in 1800, for\r\nforgery, and one for sheep-stealing. They hung people at that time for\r\ncrimes which are now punished by imprisonment or short periods of penal\r\nservitude, but there was little mercy combined with the justice then,\r\nand what small portion there happened to be was never doled out in cases\r\nwhere the heinous offence of forgery had been proved. On Easter Monday\r\n(April 19), 1802, there was another hanging match at Washwood Heath, no\r\nless than eight unfortunate wretches suffering the penalty of the law\r\nfor committing forgeries and other crimes in this neighbourhood. There\r\nwould seem to have been some little excitement in respect to this\r\nwholesale slaughter, and perhaps fears of a rescue were entertained, for\r\nthere were on guard 240 of the King's Dragoon Guards, then stationed at\r\nour Barracks, under the command of Lieut.-Col. Toovey Hawley, besides a\r\ndetachment sent from Coventry as escort with the prisoners. The last\r\npublic execution here under the old laws was that of Philip Matsell, who\r\nwas sentenced to be hanged for shooting a watchman named Twyford, on the\r\nnight of July 22, 1806. An _alibi_ was set up in defence, and though it\r\nwas unsuccessful, circumstances afterwards came to light tending to\r\nprove that though Matsell was a desperado of the worst kind, who had\r\nlong kept clear of the punishments he had deserved, in this instance he\r\nsuffered for another. There was a disreputable gang with one of whom,\r\nKate Pedley, Matsell had formed an intimate connection, who had a grudge\r\nagainst Twyford on account of his interfering and preventing several\r\nrobberies they had planned, and it is said that it was his paramour, Kit\r\nPedley, who really shot Twyford, having dressed herself in Matsell's\r\nclothes while he was in a state of drunkenness. However, he was\r\nconvicted and brought here (Aug. 23), from Warwick, sitting on his\r\ncoffin in an open cart, to be executed at the bottom of Great Charles\r\nStreet. The scaffold was a rough platform about ten feet high, the\r\ngallows rising from the centre thereof, Matsell having to stand upon\r\nsome steps while the rope was adjusted round his neck. During this\r\noperation he managed to kick his shoes off among the crowd, having sworn\r\nthat he would never die with his shoes on, as he had been many a time\r\ntold would be his fate. The first execution at Winson Green Gaol was\r\nthat of Henry Kimberley (March 17, 1885) for the murder of Mrs. Palmer.\r\n\r\n~Exhibitions.~--It has long been matter of wonder to intelligent\r\nforeigners that the \"Toyshop of the World\" (\"Workshop of the World\"\r\nwould be nearer the mark) has never organised a permanent exhibition of\r\nits myriad manufactures. There is not a city, or town, and hardly a\r\ncountry in the universe that could better build, fit up, or furnish such\r\na place than Birmingham; and unless it is from the short-sighted policy\r\nof keeping samples and patterns from the view of rivals in trade--a\r\nfallacious idea in these days of commercial travellers and town\r\nagencies--it must be acknowledged our merchants and manufacturers are\r\nnot keeping up with the times in this respect. Why should Birmingham be\r\nwithout its Crystal Palace of Industry when there is hardly an article\r\nused by man or woman (save food and dress materials) but what is made in\r\nher workshops? We have the men, we have the iron, and we have the money,\r\ntoo! And it is to be hoped that ere many years are over, some of our\r\ngreat guns will see their way to construct a local Exhibition that shall\r\nattract people from the very ends of the earth to this \"Mecca\" of ours.\r\nAs it is, from the grand old days of Boulton and his wonderful Soho,\r\ndown to to-day, there has been hardly a Prince or potentate, white,\r\nblack, copper, or coffee coloured, who has visited England, but that\r\nhave come to peep at our workshops, mayor after mayor having the\r\n\"honour\" to toady to them and trot them round the back streets and slums\r\nto where the men of the bench, the file, and the hammer have been\r\ndiligently working generation after generation, for the fame and the\r\nname of our world-known town. As a mere money speculation such a\r\nshow-room must pay, and the first cost, though it might be heavy, would\r\nsoon be recouped by the influx of visitors, the increase of orders, and\r\nthe advancement of trade that would result. There _have_ been a few\r\nexhibitions held here of one sort and another, but nothing on the plan\r\nsuggested above. The first on our file is that held at the Shakespeare\r\nrooms early in 1839, when a few good pictures and sundry specimens of\r\nmanufactures were shown. This was followed by the comprehensive\r\nMechanics' Institute Exhibition opened in Newhall Street, December 19th,\r\nsame year, which was a success in every way, the collection of\r\nmechanical models, machinery, chemical and scientific productions,\r\ncuriosities, &c., being extensive and valuable; it remained open\r\nthirteen weeks. In the following year this exhibition was revived\r\n(August 11, 1840), but so far as the Institute, for whose benefit it was\r\nintended, was concerned, it had been better if never held, for it proved\r\na loss, and only helped towards the collapse of the Institute, which\r\nclosed in 1841. Railway carriages and tramcars propelled by electricity\r\nare the latest wonders of 1883; but just three-and-forty years back, one\r\nof our townsmen, Mr. Henry Shaw, had invented an \"electro-galvanic\r\nrailway carriage and tender,\" which formed one of the attractions of\r\nthis Exhibition. It went very well until injured by (it is supposed)\r\nsome spiteful nincompoop who, not having the brain to invent anything\r\nhimself, tried to prevent others doing so. The next Exhibition, or, to\r\nbe more strictly correct, \"Exposition of Art and Manufactures,\" was held\r\nin the old residence of the Lloyd's family, known as Bingley House,\r\nstanding in its own grounds a little back from Broad Street, and on the\r\nsite of the present Bingley Hall. This was in 1849, and from the fact of\r\nits being visited (Nov. 12) by Prince Albert, who is generally credited\r\nwith being the originator of International Exhibitions, it is believed\r\nthat here he obtained the first ideas which led to the great \"World's\r\nFair\" of 1851, in Hyde Park.--Following the opening of Aston Hall by Her\r\nMajesty in 1858, many gentlemen of position placed their treasures of\r\nart and art manufacture at the disposal of the Committee for a time, and\r\nthe result was the collecting together of so rich a store that the\r\nLondon papers pronounced it to be after the \"Great Exhibition\" and the\r\nManchester one, the most successful, both as regarded contents and\r\nattendance, of any Exhibition therebefore held out of the Metropolis.\r\nThere were specimens of some of the greatest achievements in the arts of\r\npainting, sculpture, porcelain and pottery, carving and enamelling;\r\nancient and modern metalwork, rich old furniture, armour, &c, that had\r\never been gathered together, and there can be little doubt that the\r\nadvance which has since taken place in the scientific and artistic trade\r\ncircles of the town spring in great measure from this Exhibition.--On\r\nthe 28th of August, 1865, an Industrial Exhibition was opened at Bingley\r\nHall, and so far as attendance went, it must take first rank, 160,645\r\nvisitors having passed the doors.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Exhibitions_.--The Birmingham Agricultural Exhibition\r\nSociety, who own Bingley Hall, is the same body as the old Cattle Show\r\nSociety, the modern name being adopted in 1871. As stated elsewhere, the\r\nfirst Cattle Show was held in Kent Street, Dec. 10, 1849; the second in\r\nBingley Hall, which was erected almost solely for the purposes of this\r\nSociety, and here they have acquired the name of being the best in the\r\nkingdom. To give the statistics of entries, sales, admissions, and\r\nreceipts at all the Shows since 1849, would take more space than can be\r\nafforded, and though the totals would give an idea of the immense\r\ninfluence such Exhibitions must have on the welfare and prosperity of\r\nthe agricultural community, the figures themselves would be but dry\r\nreading, and those for the past few years will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           1877. 1878. 1879. 1880. 1881. 1882. 1883.\r\nCattle ...................  113   125   152   108   161   150   101\r\nSheep ....................   69    91    64    47    88    85    75\r\nPigs .....................   64    73    52    60    58    67    69\r\nCorn .....................   27    58    29    36    55    67    66\r\nRoots ....................   94   112   175   182   124   131   117\r\nPotatoes .................   76   116   138    88   104    96   187\r\nPoultry .................. 2077  2149  2197  2247  2409  2489  2816\r\nPigeons ..................  629   715   702   815   902   838  1332\r\n                          ----------------------------\r\n                           3149  3439  3505  3583  3901  3923  4763\r\n                          ----------------------------\r\n\r\n                    1877.  1878.  1879.  1880.  1881.   1882.  1883.\r\nNo. of Visitors .. 53,501 65,830 38,536 47,321 55,361  50,226\r\nReceipts ......... £1,673 £1,997 £1,206 £1,585 £1,815  £1,665\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: No figures are given in the original for 1883 in\r\nthis table.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Christmas Cattle Show, the Society commenced in\r\nMarch, 1869, a separate exhibition and sale of pure-bred shorthorns,\r\nmore than 400 beasts of this class being sent every year. Indeed, the\r\nlast show is said to have been the largest ever held in any country. The\r\nvalue of the medals, cups, and prizes awarded at these cattle shows\r\naverages nearly £2,400 per year, many of them being either subscribed\r\nfor or given by local firms and gentlemen interested in the breeding or\r\nrearing of live stock. One of the principal of these prizes is the\r\nElkington Challenge Cup, valued at 100 guineas, which, after being won\r\nby various exhibitors during the past ten years, was secured at the last\r\nshow by Mr. John Price, who had fulfilled the requirements of the donors\r\nby winning it three times. Messrs. Elkington & Co. have most liberally\r\ngiven another cup of the same value. In 1876, for the first time since\r\nits establishment in 1839, the Royal Agricultural Society held its\r\nexhibition here, the ground allotted for its use being seventy acres at\r\nthe rear of Aston Hall, twenty-five acres being part of the Park itself.\r\nThat it was most successful may be gathered from the fact that over\r\n265,000 persons visited the show, which lasted from July 19th to 24th.\r\n\r\n_Poultry_ forms part of the Bingley Hall Exhibition, and numerically the\r\nlargest portion thereof, as per the table of entries, which is well\r\nworth preserving also for showing when new classes of birds have been\r\nfirst penned:\r\n\r\n\r\n               1876 1'77 1'78 1'79 1'80 1'81 1'82\r\nBrahma Pootras  407  258  366  376  362  439  429\r\nDorkings ...... 167  178  220  209  194  238  277\r\nCochin ........ 331  415  412  433  421  431  412\r\nLangshans .....  --   --   --   49   66   49   47\r\nMalay .........  63   38   49   47   48   36   43\r\nCreve Coeur ...  93  117   94   38   28   33   24\r\nHoudans .......  --   --   --   56   65   54   71\r\nLa Fleche .....  --   --   --   --   --   --   12\r\nSpanish .......  48   33   45   27   32   31   37\r\nAndalusians ...  --   --   --   16   23   29   43\r\nLeghorns ......  --   --   --   25   12   20   17\r\nPlymouth Rocks   --   --   --   --   --   17   20\r\nMinorcas ......  --   --    7    8    6    9    3\r\nPolish ........  78   76   98   91   83   98   63\r\nSultans .......  --   --   --    6    7    8    6\r\nSilkies .......  --   --   --   --   --   11    7\r\nGame .......... 351  341  314  241  267  287  353\r\nAseels ........  --   --   --   27   28   20   11\r\nHamburghs ..... 148  175  145  159  129  141  153\r\nOther Breeds ..  35   47  126   20   20   21    7\r\nSelling Classes  --   --   --   66   90   93  102\r\nBantams .......  95   63   82   70  105   96  105\r\nDucks ......... 100  102  115  137  163  144  141\r\nGeese .........  21   21   31   22   31   21   23\r\nTurkeys .......  95   96   52   82   67   81   60\r\nPigeons........ 670  629  715  702  815  903  838\r\n   Total ......---------------------------------\r\n               2072 2569 2873 2899 3062 3316 3325\r\n\r\n\r\nFanciers give wonderfully strange prices sometimes. Cochin China fowls\r\nhad but lately been introduced, and were therefore \"the rage\" in 1851-2.\r\nAt the Poultry Show in the latter year a pair of these birds were sold\r\nfor £30, and at a sale by auction afterwards two prize birds were\r\nknocked down at £40 each: it was said that the sellers crowed louder\r\nthan the roosters.\r\n\r\n_Fine Art_.--The first exhibition of pictures took place in 1814, and\r\nthe second in 1827. In addition to the Spring and Autumn Exhibitions at\r\nthe New Street Rooms, there is now a yearly show of pictures by the\r\nmembers of the \"Art Circle,\" a society established in 1877, for\r\npromoting friendship among young local artists; their first opening was\r\non Nov. 28, at 19, Temple Row. On Nov. 17, 1879, Mr. Thrupp commenced a\r\nyearly exhibition of China paintings, to which the lady artists\r\ncontributed 243 specimens of their skill in decorating porcelain and\r\nchina.\r\n\r\n_Horses and hounds_.--The first exhibition of these took place at the\r\nLower Grounds, Aug. 12, 1879. There had been a Horse Show at Bingley\r\nHall for several years prior to 1876, but it had dropped out for want of\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n_Birds_.--An exhibition of canaries and other song birds, was held Aug.\r\n18, 1874. Another was held in 1882, at the time of the Cattle Show.\r\n\r\n_Pigeons_.--The first exhibition of pigeons in connection with the\r\nBirmingham Columbarian Society, took place in Dec., 1864. The annual\r\nSpring pigeon show at the Repository, opened March 20,1878. There have\r\nalso been several at St. James' Hall, the first dating Sept. 24, 1874.\r\n\r\n_Dogs_.--Like the Cattle Show, the original Birmingham Dog Show has\r\nextended its sphere, and is now known as the National Exhibition of\r\nSporting and other Dogs. The show takes place in Curzon Hall, and the\r\ndates are always the same as for the agricultural show in Bingley Hall.\r\nThere is yearly accommodation for 1,000 entries, and it is seldom that a\r\nless number is exhibited, the prizes being numerous, as well as\r\nvaluable. At the meeting of the subscribers held July 19, 1883, it was\r\nresolved to form a new representative body, to be called the National\r\nDog Club, having for its object the improvement of dogs, dog shows, and\r\ndog trials, and the formation of a national court of appeal on all\r\nmatters in dispute. It was also resolved to publish a revised and\r\ncorrect stud book, to include all exhibitions where 400 dogs and upwards\r\nwere shown, and to continue it annually, the Council having guaranteed\r\n£150, the estimated cost of the publication of the book. This step was\r\ntaken in consequence of the action of certain members of the Kennel\r\nClub, who passed what had been called \"The Boycotting Rules,\" calling\r\nupon its members to abstain from either exhibiting or judging at shows\r\nwhich were not under Kennel Club rules, and excluding winning dogs at\r\nsuch shows from being entered in the Kennel Club Stud Book, many of the\r\nprincipal exhibitors being dissatisfied with such arbitrary proceedings,\r\nevidently intended to injure the Birmingham shows. At each show there\r\nare classes for bloodhounds, deerhounds, greyhounds, otterhounds,\r\nbeagles, fox terriers, pointers, English setters, black-and-tan setters,\r\nIrish setters, retrievers, Irish spaniels, water spaniels (best Irish),\r\nClumber spaniels, Sussex spaniels, spaniels (black), ditto (other than\r\nblack), dachshunds, bassett hounds, foreign sporting dogs, mastiffs, St.\r\nBernards, Newfoundlands, sheep dogs, Dalmatians, bulldogs,\r\nbull-terriers, smooth-haired terriers, black-and-tan terriers (large),\r\nsmall ditto black-and-tan terriers with uncut ears, Skye-terriers,\r\nDandie Dinmonts, Bedlington terriers, Irish terriers, Airedale or\r\nWaterside terriers, wire-haired terriers, Scotch terriers (hard haired),\r\nYorkshire terriers, Pomeranians, pugs, Maltese, Italian greyhounds,\r\nBlenheim spaniels, King Charles spaniels, smooth-haired toy spaniels,\r\nbroken-haired ditto, large and small sized foreign dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   1876. 1877. 1878. 1879. 1880. 1881. 1882.\r\n\r\nNo. of Visitors.   14981 17948 19500 14399 16796 16849 15901\r\n\r\nReceipts at doors.  £664  £740  £820  £580  £728  £714  £648\r\n\r\nSales of Dogs.      £556  £367  £485  £554  £586  £474  £465\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1879, the exhibition of guns and sporting implements was introduced,\r\nan additional attraction which made no difference financially, or in the\r\nnumber of visitors.\r\n\r\n_Sporting_.--An exhibition of requisites and appliances in connection\r\nwith sports and pastimes of all kinds was opened in Bingley Hall, Aug\r\n28, 1882. In addition to guns and ammunition, bicycles and tricycles,\r\nthere were exhibited boats, carriages, billiard tables, &c.\r\n\r\n_Dairy Utensils_.--The first of these exhibitions, June, 1880, attracted\r\nconsiderable attention for its novelty. It is held yearly in Bingley\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n_Bees_.--An exhibition of bees, beehives, and other apiary appliances\r\ntook place at the Botanical Gardens, in Aug., 1879.\r\n\r\n_Food and Drinks_.--A week's exhibition of food, wines, spirits,\r\ntemperance beverages, brewing utensils, machinery, fittings, stoves and\r\nappliances, was held in Bingley Hall, December 12-20, 1881.\r\n\r\n_Building_.--A trades exhibition of all kinds of building material,\r\nmachinery, &c., was held in 1882.\r\n\r\n_Bicycles, &c._--The Speedwell Club began their annual exhibition of\r\nbicycles, tricycles, and their accessories in February, 1882, when about\r\n300 machines were shown. In the following year the number was nearly\r\n400; in 1884, more than 500; in 1885, 600.\r\n\r\n_Roots_.--Messrs. Webb, of Wordsley, occupied Curzon Hall, November 20,\r\n1878, with an exhibition of prize roots, grown by their customers.\r\n\r\n_Fruit, Flowers, &c._--The first flower show we have note of was on June\r\n19, 1833. The first chrysanthemum show was in 1860. The first Birmingham\r\nrose show in 1874 (at Aston); the second, five years later, at Bingley\r\nHall. The Harborne gooseberry-growers have shown up every year since\r\n1815, and the cultivators of _pommes de terre_ in the same neighbourhood\r\nfirst laid their tables in public in Sept., 1879.\r\n\r\n~Exhibitions of 1851 and 1862.~--Even as Birmingham may be said to have\r\ngiven the first idea for the \"Great Exhibition\" of 1851, so it had most\r\nto do with the building thereof, the great palace in Hyde Park being\r\ncommenced by Messrs. Fox, Henderson & Co., July 26, 1850, and it was\r\nfinished in nine months at a total cost of £176,031. In its erection\r\nthere were used 4,000 tons of iron, 6,000,000 cubic feet of woodwork,\r\nand 31 acres of sheet glass, requiring the work of 1,800 men to put it\r\ntogether. 287 local exhibitors applied for space amounting to 22,070\r\nsup. feet, namely, 10,183 feet of flooring, 4,932 feet of table area,\r\nand 6,255 feet of wall space. The \"glory\" of this exhibition was the\r\ngreat crystal fountain in the centre, manufactured by Messrs. Osler, of\r\nBroad Street, a work of art till then never surpassed in the world's\r\nhistory of glass-making and glass cutting, and which now pours forth its\r\nwaters in one of the lily tanks in Sydenham Palace. Many rare specimens\r\nof Birmingham manufacture besides were there, and the metropolis of the\r\nMidlands had cause to be proud of the works of her sons thus exhibited.\r\nFewer manufacturers sent their samples to the exhibition of 1862, but\r\nthere was no falling off in their beauty or design. The Birmingham Small\r\nArms trophy was a great attraction.\r\n\r\n~Explosions.~--That many deplorable accidents should occur during the\r\ncourse of manufacturing such dangerous articles as gun caps and\r\ncartridges cannot be matter of surprise, and, perhaps, on the whole,\r\nthose named in the following list may be considered as not more than the\r\naverage number to be expected:--Two lives were lost by explosion of\r\nfulminating powder in St. Mary's Square, Aug. 4. 1823.--Oct. 16, same\r\nyear, there was a gunpowder explosion in Lionel Street.--Two were killed\r\nby fireworks at the Rocket Tavern, Little Charles Street, May 2, 1834.--\r\nAn explosion at Saltley Carriage Works, Dec. 20, 1849.--Two injured at\r\nthe Proof House, Sept. 23, 1850.--Five by detonating powder in\r\nCheapside, Feb 14, 1852.--Thirty-one were injured by gas explosion at\r\nWorkhouse, Oct. 30, 1855.--Several from same cause at corner of Hope\r\nStreet, March 11, 1856.--A cap explosion took place at Ludlow's, Legge\r\nStreet, July 28, 1859.--Another at Phillips and Pursall's, Whittall\r\nStreet, Sept. 27, 1852, when twenty-one persons lost their lives.--\r\nAnother in Graham Street June 21, 1862, with eight deaths.--Boiler burst\r\nat Spring Hill, Nov. 23, 1859, injuring seven.--An explosion in the\r\nMagazine at the Barracks, March 8, 1864, killed Quartermaster McBean.--\r\nAt Kynoch's, Witton, Nov. 17, 1870, resulting in 8 deaths and 28\r\ninjured.--At Ludlow's ammunition factory, Dec. 9, 1870, when 17 were\r\nkilled and 53 injured, of whom 34 more died before Christmas.--At\r\nWitton, July 1, 1872, when Westley Richards' manager was killed.--At\r\nHobb Lane, May 11, 1874.--Of gas, in great Lister Street, Dec. 9, 1874.\r\n--Of fulminate, in the Green Lane, May 4, 1876, a youth being killed.--\r\nOf\r\ngas, at St. James's Hall, Snow Hill, Dec. 4, and at Avery's, Moat Row,\r\nDec. 31, 1878.--At a match manufactory, Phillip Street, Oct. 28, 1879,\r\nwhen Mr. Bermingham and a workman were injured.\r\n\r\n~Eye Hospital.~--See \"_Hospitals_.\"\r\n\r\n~Fairs.~--The officers of the Court Leet, whose duty it was to walk in\r\nprocession and \"proclaim\" the fairs, went through their last performance\r\nof the kind at Michaelmas, 1851. It was proposed to abolish the fairs in\r\n1860, but the final order was not given until June 8th, 1875. Of late\r\nyears there have been fairs held on the open grounds on the Aston\r\noutskirts of the borough, but the \"fun of the fair\" is altogether\r\ndifferent now to what it used to be. The original charters for the\r\nholding of fairs at Whitsuntide and Michaelmas were granted to William\r\nde Bermingham by Henry III. in 1251. These fairs were doubtless at one\r\ntime of great importance, but the introduction of railways did away with\r\nseven-tenths of their utility and the remainder was more nuisance than\r\nprofit. As a note of the trade done at one time we may just preserve the\r\nitem that in 1782 there were 56 waggon loads of onions brought into the\r\nfair.\r\n\r\n~Family Fortunes.~--Hutton in his \"History,\" with that quaint prolixity\r\nwhich was his peculiar proclivity gives numerous instances of the rise\r\nand fall of families connected with Birmingham. In addition to the\r\noriginal family of De Birmingham, now utterly extinct he traced back\r\nmany others then and now well-known names. For instance he tells us that\r\na predecessor of the Colmores in Henry VIII.'s reign kept a mercer's\r\nshop at No. 1, High Street; that the founder of the Bowyer Adderley\r\nfamily began life in a small way in this his native town in the 14th\r\ncentury; that the Foxalls sprang from a Digbeth tanner some 480 years\r\nago; and so of others. Had he lived till now he might have largely\r\nincreased his roll of local millionaires with such names as Gillott,\r\nMuntz, Mason, Rylands, &c. On the other hand he relates how some of the\r\nold families, whose names were as household words among the ancient\r\naristocracy, have come to nought; how that he had himself charitably\r\nrelieved the descendants of the Norman Mountfourds, Middemores and\r\nBracebridges, and how that the sole boast of a descendant of the Saxon\r\nEarls of Warwick was in his day the fact of his grandfather having \"kept\r\nseveral cows and sold milk.\" It is but a few years back since the\r\npresent writer saw the last direct descendant of the Holtes working as a\r\ncompositor in one of the newspaper offices of this town, and almost any\r\nday there was to be seen in the streets a truck with the name painted on\r\nof \"Charles Holte Bracebridge, Licensed Hawker!\"\r\n\r\n~Famines.~--In the year 310, it is said that 40,000 persons died in this\r\ncountry from famine. It is not known whether any \"Brums\" existed then.\r\nIn 1195 wheat was so scarce that it sold for 20s. the quarter; ten years\r\nafter it was only 12d. In 1438, the times were so hard that people ate\r\nbread made from fern roots. In 1565, a famine prevailed throughout the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n~Fashionable Quarter.~--Edgbaston is our \"West End,\" of which Thomas\r\nRagg (before he was ordained) thus wrote:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  --Glorious suburbs! long\r\n  May ye remain to bless the ancient town\r\n  Whose crown ye are; rewarder of the cares\r\n  Of those who toil amid the din and smoke\r\n  Of iron ribbed and hardy Birmingham.\r\n  And may ye long be suburbs, keeping still\r\n  Business at distance from your green retreats.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Feasts, Feeds, and Tea-fights.~--Like other Englishmen, when we have a\r\ngood opinion of people we ask them to dinner, and the number of public\r\nbreakfasts, dinners, teas, and suppers on our record is wonderful. We\r\ngive a few of the most interesting:--3,800 persons dined with our first\r\nM.P.'s., Attwood and Scholefield, at Beardsworth's Repository, Sept. 15,\r\n1834.--A Reform banquet was the attraction in the Town Hall, Jan. 28,\r\n1836.--Members and friends of the 'Chartist Church' kept their Christmas\r\nfestival, by 'taking tea' in Town Hall, Dec.28, 1841.--1,700\r\nAnti-Cornlawites (John Bright among them) did ditto Jan. 22, 1843.--The\r\ndefeat of an obnoxious Police Bill led 900 persons to banquet together\r\nApril 9, 1845.--A banquet in honour of Charles Dickens opened the year\r\n1853--The first anniversary of the Loyal and Constitutional Association\r\nwas celebrated by the dining of 848 loyal subjects, Dec. 17, 1855.--\r\ndinner was given to 1,200 poor folks in Bingley Hall, Jan. 25, 1858, to\r\nmake them remember the marriage of the Princess Royal. Those who were\r\nnot poor kept the game alive at Dee's Hotel.--John Bright was dined in\r\nTown Hall, Oct. 29, 1858.--A party of New Zealand chiefs were stuffed at\r\nsame place, March 16, 1864--To celebrate the opening of a Dining Hall in\r\nCambridge Street, a public dinner was given on All Fools' Day, 1864.--On\r\nthe 23rd April following, about 150 gentlemen breakfasted with the\r\nMayor, in honour of the Shakespeare Library being presented to the\r\ntown.--The purchase of Aston Park was celebrated by a banquet, Sept. 22,\r\n1864.--Over a hundred bellringers, at Nock's Hotel, 1868, had their\r\nclappers set wagging by Blews and Sons, in honour of the first peal of\r\nbells cast by them, and now in Bishop Ryder's Church.--The Master\r\nBakers, who have been baking dinners for the public so long, in\r\nDecember, 1874, commenced an annual series of dinners among themselves,\r\nat which neither baked meats, nor even baked potatoes, are allowed.--Of\r\npolitical and quasi-political banquets, there have been many of late\r\nyears, but as the parties have, in most cases, simply been gathered for\r\nparty purposes, their remembrance is not worth keeping.--To help pay for\r\nimprovements at General Hospital, there was a dinner at the Great\r\nWestern Hotel, June 4, 1868, and when the plate was sent round, it\r\nreceived £4,000. That was the best, and there the list must close.\r\n\r\n~Females.~--The fairer portion of our local community number (census\r\n1881) 210,050, as against 197,954 males, a preponderance of 12,096. In\r\n1871 the ladies outnumbered us by 8,515, and it would be an interesting\r\nquestion how this extra ratio arises, though as one half of the\r\nsuper-abundant petticoats are to be found in Edgbaston it may possibly\r\nonly be taken as a mark of local prosperity, and that more female\r\nservants are employed than formerly.--See \"_Population\" Tables_.\r\n\r\n~Fenianism.~--It was deemed necessary in Jan., 1881, to place guards of\r\nsoldiers at the Tower and Small Arms Factory, but the Fenians did not\r\ntrouble us; though later on a very pretty manufactory of dynamite was\r\ndiscovered in Ledsam Street.--See \"_Notable Offences_.\"\r\n\r\n~Ferrars.~--The De Ferrars were at one time Lords of the Manor, Edmund\r\nde Ferrars dying in 1438. The ancient public-house sign of \"The Three\r\nHorseshoes\" was taken from their coat of arms.\r\n\r\n~Festivals.~--Notes of the past Triennial Musical Festivals for which\r\nBirmingham is so famous, the performances, and the many great artistes\r\nwho have taken part therein, will be found further on.\r\n\r\n~Fetes~ were held in Aston Park July 27, and September 15, 1856, for the\r\nbenefit of the Queen's and General Hospitals, realising therefore\r\n£2,330. The first to \"Save Aston Hall\" took place August 17, 1857, when\r\na profit of £570 was made. There have been many since then, but more of\r\nthe private speculation class, Sangers' so-called fête at Camp Hill,\r\nJune 27, 1874, being the first of their outdoor hippodrome performances.\r\n\r\n~Fires.~--When Prince Rupert's soldiers set fire to the town, in 1643,\r\nno less than 155 houses were burned.--Early in 1751 about £500 worth of\r\nwool was burned at Alcock's, in Edgbaston Street.--May 24, 1759, the\r\nstage waggon to Worcester was set on fire by the bursting of a bottle of\r\naqua-fortis, and the contents of the waggon, valued at £5,000, were\r\ndestroyed.--In November, 1772, Mr. Crowne's hop and cheese warehouse,\r\ntop of Carr's Lane, was lessened £400 in value.--The Theatre Royal was\r\nburned August 24, 1791, and again January 6, 1820.--Jerusalem Temple,\r\nNewhall Hill, was burned March 10, 1793.--St. Peter's Church suffered\r\nJanuary 24, 1831.--There was a great blaze at Bolton's timber yard,\r\nBroad Street, May 27, 1841.--At the Manor House, Balsall Heath, in\r\n1848.--Among Onion's bellows, in March, 1853.--At the General Hospital,\r\nDecember 24, 1853.--At the Spread Eagle Concert Hall, May 5, 1855.--At a\r\nbuilder's in Alcester Street, October 4, 1858.--At Aston Brook Flour\r\nmill, June 1, 1862, with £10,000 damage.--At Lowden & Beeton's, High\r\nStreet, January 3, 1863; the firm were prosecuted as incendiaries.--At\r\nGameson's Tavern, Hill Street, December 25, 1863; six lives lost.--On\r\nthe stage at Holder's, July 3, 1865; two ballet dancers died from fright\r\nand injuries.--At Baskerville Sawmills, September 7, 1867.--In Sutton\r\nPark, August 4, 1868.--In a menagerie in Carr's Lane, January 25, 1870.\r\n--At Dowler's Plume Works, March 16.--In Denmark Street, May 23; two\r\nchildren burned.--At Worcester Wharf, June 2, 1870; two men burnt.--At\r\nWarwick Castle, Dec. 3, 1871.--At Smith's hay and straw yard, Crescent,\r\nthrough lightning, July 25, 1872.--In Sherbourne Street, June 25, 1874,\r\nand same day in Friston Street; two men burned.--At the hatter's shop in\r\nTemple Street, Nov. 25, 1875.--At Tipper's Mystery Works, May 16, and at\r\nHolford Mill, Perry Barr, August 3, 1876.--At Icke and Co.'s, Lawley\r\nStreet, May 17, 1877; £2,500 damage.--At Adam's colour warehouse,\r\nSuffolk Street, October 13, 1877; £10,000 damage.--In Bloomsbury Street,\r\nSeptember 29, 1877; an old man burned.--In Lichfield Road, November 26,\r\n1877; two horses, a cow, and 25 pigs roasted.--January 25, 1878, was a\r\nhot day, there being four fires in 15 hours.--At Hayne's flour mill,\r\nIcknield Port Road, Feb. 2, 1878, with £10,000 damage; first time steam\r\nfire engine was used.--At Baker Bros'., match manufactory, Freeth\r\nStreet, February 11.--At Grew's and at Cund's printers, March 16, 1878;\r\nboth places being set on fire by a vengeful thief; £2,000 joint damage.\r\n--At corner of Bow Street, July 29, 1878.--At Dennison's shop, opposite\r\nMuseum Concert Hall, August 26, 1878, when Mrs. Dennison, her baby, her\r\nsister, and a servant girl lost their lives. The inquest terminated on\r\nSeptember 30 (or rather at one o'clock next morning), when a verdict of\r\n\"accidental death\" was given in the case of the infant, who had been\r\ndropped during an attempted rescue, and with respect to the others that\r\nthey had died from suffocation caused by a five designedly lighted, but\r\nby whom the jury had not sufficient evidence to say. Great fault was\r\nfound with the management of the fire brigade, a conflict of authority\r\nbetween them and the police giving rise to very unpleasant feelings. At\r\nCadbury's cocoa manufactory, November 23, 1878. In Legge Street, at a\r\ngun implement maker's, December 14, 1878; £600 damage.--And same day at\r\na gun maker's, Whittall Street; £300 damage.--At Hawkes's looking-glass\r\nmanufactory, Bromsgrove Street, January 8, 1879; £20,000 damage.--The\r\nReference Library, January 11, 1879 (a most rueful day); damage\r\nincalculable and irreparable.--At Hinks and Sons' lamp works, January\r\n30, 1879; £15,000 damage.--At the Small Arms Factory, Adderley Road,\r\nNovember 11, 1879; a fireman injured.--At Grimsell and Sons', Tower\r\nStreet, May 5, 1880; over £5,000 damage.--Ward's cabinet manufactory,\r\nBissell Street, April 11, 1885.\r\n\r\n~Firearms.~--See \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Fire Brigades.~--A volunteer brigade, to help at fires, was organised\r\nhere in February 1836, but as the several companies, after introducing\r\ntheir engines, found it best to pay a regular staff to work them, the\r\nvolunteers, for the time, went to the \"right about.\" In 1863 a more\r\npretentious attempt to constitute a public or volunteer brigade of\r\nfiremen, was made, the members assembling for duty on the 21st of\r\nFebruary, the Norwich Union engine house being the headquarters; but the\r\nnovelty wore off as the uniforms got shabby, and the work was left to\r\nthe old hands, until the Corporation took the matter in hand.  A\r\nVolunteer Fire Brigade for Aston was formed at the close of 1878, and\r\nits rules approved by the Local Board on Jan. 7, 1879. They attended and\r\ndid good service at the burning of the Reference Library on the\r\nfollowing Saturday. August 23, 1879 the Aston boys, with three and\r\ntwenty other brigades from various parts of the country, held a kind of\r\nefficiency competition at the Lower Grounds, and being something new in\r\nit attracted many. The Birmingham brigade were kept at home, possibly on\r\naccount of the anniversary of the Digbeth fire. Balsall Heath and\r\nHarborne are also supplied with their own brigades, and an Association\r\nof Midland Brigades has lately been formed which held their first drill\r\nin the Priory, April 28, 1883.\r\n\r\n~Fire Engines.~--In 1839 the Birmingham Fire Office had two engines,\r\nvery handsome specimens of the article too, being profusely decorated\r\nwith wooden battle axes, iron scroll-work, &c. One of these engines was\r\npainted in many colours; but the other a plain drab, the latter it was\r\nlaughingly said, being kept for the Society of Friends, the former for\r\nsociety at large. The first time a \"portable\" or hand engine was used\r\nhere was on the occurrence of a fire in a tobacconist's shop in\r\nCheapside Oct. 29, 1850. The steam fire engine was brought here in Oct.\r\n1877.--See \"_Fire Engine Stations_\" under \"_Public Buildings_.\"\r\n\r\n~Fire Grates.~--The first oven grate used in this district was\r\nintroduced in a house at \"the City of Nineveh\" about the year 1818, and\r\ncreated quite a sensation.\r\n\r\n~Fire Insurance Companies.~--The Birmingham dates its establishment from\r\nMarch 1805. All the companies now in existence are more or less\r\nrepresented here by agents, and no one need be uninsured long, as their\r\noffices are so thick on the ground round Bennet's Hill and Colmore Row,\r\nthat it has been seriously suggested the latter thoroughfare should he\r\nrechristened and be called Insurance Street. It was an agent who had the\r\nassurance to propose the change.\r\n\r\n~Fish.~--In April, 1838, a local company was floated for the purpose of\r\nbringing fish from London and Liverpool. It began swimmingly, but fish\r\ndidn't swim to Birmingham, and though several other attempts have been\r\nmade to form companies of similar character, the trade has been kept\r\naltogether in private hands, and to judge from the sparkling rings to be\r\nseen on the hands of the ladies who condescend to sell us our matutinal\r\nbloaters in the Market Hall, the business is a pretty good one--and who\r\ndare say those _dames de salle_ are not also pretty and good? The supply\r\nof fish to this town, as given by the late Mr. Hanman, averaged from 50\r\nto 200 tons per day (one day in June, 1879, 238 tons came from Grimsby\r\nalone) or, each in its proper season, nearly as follows:--Mackerel,\r\n2,000 boxes of about 2 cwt. each; herrings, 2,000 barrels of 1-1/2 cwt.\r\neach; salmon, 400 boxes of 2-1/2 cwt. each; lobsters, 15 to 20 barrels\r\nof 1 cwt. each; crabs, 50 to 60 barrels of 1-1/4 cwt. each; plaice,\r\n1,500 packages of 2 cwt. each; codfish, 200 barrels of 2 cwt. each;\r\nconger eels, 20 barrels of 2 cwt. each; skate, 10 to 20 barrels of 2\r\ncwt. each.--See \"_Markets_.\"\r\n\r\n~Fishing.~--There is very little scope for the practice of Isaac\r\nWalton's craft near to Birmingham, and lovers of the gentle art must go\r\nfarther afield to meet with good sport. The only spots within walking\r\ndistance are the pools at Aston Park and Lower Grounds, at Aston Tavern,\r\nat Bournbrook Hotel (or, as it is better known, Kirby's), and at Pebble\r\nMill, in most of which may be found perch, roach, carp, and pike. At\r\nPebble Mill, March 20, last year, a pike was captured 40 inches long,\r\nand weighing 22 lbs., but that was a finny rarity, and not likely to be\r\nmet with there again, as the pool (so long the last resort of suicidally\r\ninclined mortals) is to be filled up. A little farther off are waters at\r\nSarehole, at Yardley Wood, and the reservoir at King's Norton, but with\r\nthese exceptions anglers must travel to their destinations by rail.\r\nThere is good fishing at Sutton Coldfield, Barnt Green (for reservoir at\r\nTardebigge), Alcester, Shustoke, Salford Priors, and other places within\r\na score of miles, but free fishing nowhere. Anyone desirous of real\r\nsport should join the Birmingham and Midland Piscatorial Association\r\n(established June, 1878), which rents portions of the river Trent and\r\nother waters. This society early in 1880, tried their hands at\r\nartificial salmon-hatching, one of the tanks of the aquarium at Aston\r\nLower Grounds being placed at their disposal. They were successful in\r\nbringing some thousand or more of their interesting protegees from the\r\nova into fish shape, but we cannot find the market prices for salmon or\r\ntrout at all reduced.\r\n\r\n~Fishmongers' Hall.~--Not being satisfied with the accommodation\r\nprovided for them in the Fish Market, the Fish and Game Dealers'\r\nAssociation, at their first annual meeting (Feb. 13, 1878), proposed to\r\nerect a Fishmongers' Hall, but they did not carry out their intention.\r\n\r\n~Flogging.~--In \"the good old days,\" when George the Third was King, it\r\nwas not very uncommon for malefactors to be flogged through the streets,\r\ntied to the tail end of a cart. In 1786 several persons, who had been\r\nsentenced at the Assizes, were brought back here and so whipped through\r\nthe town; and in one instance, where a young man had been caught\r\nfilching from the Mint, the culprit was taken to Soho works, and in the\r\nfactory yard, there stripped and flogged by \"Black Jack\" of the Dungeon,\r\nas a warning to his fellow-workmen. This style of punishment would\r\nhardly do now, but if some few of the present race of \"roughs\" could be\r\ntreated to a dose of \"the cat\" now and then, it might add considerably\r\nto the peace and comfort of the borough. Flogging by proxy was not\r\nunknown in some of the old scholastic establishments, but whipping a\r\nscarecrow seems to have been the amusement on February 26th. 1842, when\r\nSir Robert Peel, at that day a sad delinquent politically, was publicly\r\nflogged in elligy.\r\n\r\n~Floods~--The milldams at Sutton burst their banks, July 24, 1668, and\r\nmany houses were swept away.--On the 24th November, 1703, a three days'\r\nstorm arose which extended over the whole kingdom; many parts of the\r\nMidlands being flooded and immense damage caused, farmers' live stock\r\nespecially suffering. 15,000 sheep were drowned in one pan of\r\nGloucestershire; several men and hundreds of sheep near to Worcester;\r\nthe losses in Leicestershire and Staffordshire being also enormous.\r\nThough there is no local record respecting it here, there can be little\r\ndoubt that the inhabitants had their share of the miseries.--July 2,\r\n1759, a man and several horses were drowned in a flood near Meriden.--\r\nHeavy rains caused great floods here in January, 1764.--On April 13,\r\n1792, a waterspout, at the Lickey Hills, turned the Rea into a torrent.\r\n--The lower parts of the town were flooded through the heavy rain of\r\nJune 26, 1830.--There were floods in Deritend and Bordesley, Nov. 11,\r\n1852.--June 23, 1861, parts of Aston, Digbeth, and the Parade were\r\nswamped.--Feb. 8, 1865, Hockley was flooded through the bursting of the\r\nCanal banks; and a simmilar accident to the Worcester Canal, May 25,\r\n1872, laid the roads and gardens about Wheeley's Road under water.--\r\nThere were very heavy rains in July and October, 1875, causing much\r\ndamage in the lower parts of the town.--Aug. 2 and 3, 1879, many parts\r\nof the outskirts were flooded, in comparatively the shortest time in\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n~Flour Mills.~--The Union Mill Co. (now known as the Old Union, &c.) was\r\nformed early in 1796, with a capital of £7,000 in £1 shares, each\r\nshare-holder being required to take a given amount of bread per week.\r\nThough at starting it was announced that the undertaking was not\r\nintended for profit,--such were the advantages derived from the\r\noperations of the Company that the shareholders it is said, in addition\r\nto a dividend of 10 per cent., received in the course of couple of years\r\na benefit equal to 600 per cent, in the shape of reduced prices. Large\r\ndividends have at times been received, but a slightly different tale is\r\nnow told.--The New Union Mill was started in 1810; the Snow Hill Mill\r\nabout 1781; the Britannia Mills in 1862.\r\n\r\n~Fly Vans.~--\"Fly Boats\" to the various places connected with Birmingham\r\nby the canals were not sufficient for our townspeople seventy years ago,\r\nand an opposition to the coaches started in 1821, in the shape of Fly\r\nVans or light Post Waggons, was hailed with glee. These Fly Vans left\r\nthe Crescent Wharf (where Showell and Sons' Stores are now) three\r\nevenings a week, and reached Sheffield the following day. This was the\r\nfirst introduction of a regular \"parcels' post,\" though the authorities\r\nwould not allow of anything like a letter being sent with a parcel, _if_\r\nthey knew it.\r\n\r\n~Foolish Wager.~--On July 8,1758, for a wager, a man named Moraon got\r\nover the battlements of the tower at St. Martin's, and safely let\r\nhimself down to the ground (a distance of 73 feet) without rope or\r\nladder, his strength of muscle enabling him to reach from cornerstone to\r\ncornerstone, and cling thereto as he descended.\r\n\r\n~Football.~--See \"_Sports_.\"\r\n\r\n~Forgeries.~--The manufacture of bogus bank-notes was carried on here,\r\nat one time, to an alarming extent, and even fifty years ago, though he\r\nwas too slippery a fish for the authorities to lay hold of, it was\r\nwell-known there was a clever engraver in the Inkleys who would copy\r\nanything put before him for the merest trifle, even though the\r\npunishment was most severe. Under \"_Notable Offences_\" will be found\r\nseveral cases of interest in this peculiar line of business.\r\n\r\n~Forks.~--Our ancestors did without them, using their fingers. Queen\r\nElizabeth had several sent to her from Spain, but she seldom used them,\r\nand we may be quite sure it was long after that ere the taper fingers of\r\nthe fair Brums ceased to convey the titbits to their lips. Even that\r\nsapient sovereign, James I., the Scotch Solomon, did not use the foreign\r\ninvention, believing possibly with the preacher who denounced them in\r\nthe pulpit that it was an insult to the Almighty to touch the meat\r\nprepared for food with anything but one's own fingers. Later on, when\r\nthe coaches began to throng the road, gentlemen were in the habit of\r\ncarrying with them their own knife and fork for use, so seldom were the\r\nlatter articles to be found at the country inns, and the use of forks\r\ncannot be said to have become general more than a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n~Forward.~--The self-appropriated motto of our borough, chosen at one of\r\nthe earliest committee meetings of the Town Council in 1839. Mr. William\r\nMiddlemore is said to have proposed the use of the word as being\r\npreferable to any Latin, though \"Vox populi, vox Dei,\" and other like\r\nappropriate mottoes, have been suggested. Like all good things, however,\r\nthe honour of originating this motto has been contested, the name of\r\nRobert Crump Mason having been given as its author.\r\n\r\n~Fogs.~--Bad as it may be now and then in the neighbourhood of some of\r\nour works, it there is one thing in nature we can boast of more than\r\nanother, it is our comparatively clear atmosphere, and it is seldom that\r\nwe are troubled with fogs of any kind. In this respect, at all events,\r\nthe Midland metropolis is better off than its Middlesex namesake, with\r\nits \"London particular,\" as Mr. Guppy calls it. But there was one day\r\n(17th) in December, 1879, when we were, by some atmospheric phenomena,\r\ntreated to such \"a peasouper\" that we must note it as being the\r\ncuriosity of the day, the street traffic being put a stop to while the\r\nfog lasted.\r\n\r\n~Folk-lore.~--Funny old sayings are to be met with among the quips and\r\nquirks of \"folk-lore\" that tickled the fancies of our grandfathers. The\r\nfollowing is to [**] with several changes, but it [**] good to be\r\nlost:--\r\n\r\n  \"Sutton for mutton,\r\n  Tamworth for beeves,\r\n  Walsall for knockknees,\r\n  And Brummagem for thieves.\"\r\n\r\n~Fountains.~--Messrs. Messenger and Sons designed, executed, and\r\nerected, to order of the Street Commissioners, in 1851, a very neat, and\r\nfor the situation, appropriate, fountain in the centre of the Market\r\nHall, but which has since been removed to Highgate Park, where it\r\nappears sadly out of place.\r\n\r\n  The poor little boys, without any clothes,\r\n  Looking in winter as if they were froze.\r\n\r\nA number of small drinking-fountains or taps have been presented to the\r\ntown by benevolent persons (one of the neatest being that put up at the\r\nexpense of Mr. William White in Bristol Road in 1876), and granite\r\ncattle-troughs are to be found in Constitution Hill, Icknield Street,\r\nEasy Row, Albert Street, Gosta Green, Five Ways, &c. In July, 1876, Miss\r\nRyland paid for the erection of a very handsome fountain at the bottom\r\nof Bradford Street, in near proximity to the Smith field. It is so\r\nconstructed as to be available for quenching the thirst not only of\r\nhuman travellers, but also of horses, dogs, &c., and on this account it\r\nhas been appropriately handed over to the care of the Society for the\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals. It is composed of granite, and as it\r\nis surmounted by a gas lamp, it is, in more senses than one, both useful\r\nand ornamental.--The fountain in connection with the Chamberlain\r\nMemorial, at back of Town Hall, is computed to throw out five million\r\ngallons of water per annum (ten hours per day), a part of which is\r\nutilised at the fishstalls in the markets. The Water Committee have\r\nlately put up an ornamental fountain in Hagley Road, in connection with\r\nthe pipe supply for that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n~Foxalls.~--For centuries one of the most prosperous of our local\r\nfamilies, having large tanneries in Digbeth as far back as 1570;\r\nafterwards as cutlers and ironmongers down to a hundred years ago. They\r\nwere also owners of the Old Swan, the famous coaching house, and which\r\nit is believed was the inn that Prince Rupert and his officers came to\r\nwhen Thomas, the ostler, was shot, through officiously offering to take\r\ntheir horses.\r\n\r\n~Fox Hunts.~--With the exception of the annual exhibition of fox-hounds\r\nand other sporting dogs, Birmingham has not much to do with hunting\r\nmatters, though formerly a red coat or two might often have been seen in\r\nthe outskirts riding to meets not far away. On one occasion, however, as\r\ntold the writer by one of these old inhabitants whose memories are our\r\nhistorical textbooks, the inhabitants of Digbeth and Deritend were\r\ntreated to the sight of a hunt in full cry. It was a nice winter's\r\nmorning of 1806, when Mr. Reynard sought to save his brush by taking a\r\nstraight course down the Coventry Road right into town. The astonishment\r\nof the shop-keepers may be imagined when the rush of dogs and horses\r\npassed rattling by. Round the corner, down Bordesley High Street, past\r\nthe Crown and Church, over the bridge and away for the Shambles and Corn\r\nCheaping went the fox, and close to his heels followed the hounds, who\r\ncaught their prey at last near to The Board. \"S.D.R.,\" in one of his\r\nchatty gossips anent the old taverns of Birmingham, tells of a somewhat\r\nsimilar scene from the Quinton side of the town, the bait, however,\r\nbeing not a fox, but the trail-scent of a strong red herring, dragged at\r\nhis stirrup, in wicked devilry, by one of the well-known haunters of old\r\nJoe Lindon's. Still, we _have_ had fox-hunts of our own, one of the\r\nvulpine crew being killed in St. Mary's Churchyard, Feb. 26, 1873, while\r\nanother was captured (Sept. 11, 1883) by some navvies at work on the\r\nextension of New Street Station. The fox, which was a young one, was\r\nfound asleep in one of the subways, though how he got to such a strange\r\ndormitory is a puzzle, and he gave a quarter-hour's good sport before\r\nbeing secured.\r\n\r\n~Freemasons.~--See \"_Masonic_.\"\r\n\r\n~Freeth, the Poet.~--The first time Freeth's name appears in the public\r\nprints is in connection with a dinner given at his coffee-house, April\r\n17, 1770, to celebrate Wilkes' release from prison. He died September\r\n29, 1808, aged 77, and was buried in the Old Meeting House, the\r\nfollowing lines being graved on his tombstone:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Free and easy through life 'twas his wish to proceed.\r\n  Good men he revered, whatever their creed.\r\n  His pride was a sociable evening to spend,\r\n  For no man loved better his pipe and his friend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Friendly Societies~ are not of modern origin, traces of many having\r\nbeen found in ancient Greek inscriptions. The Romans also had similar\r\nsocieties, Mr. Tomkins, the chief clerk of the Registrar-General, having\r\nfound and deciphered the accounts of one at Lanuvium, the entrance fee\r\nto which was 100 sesterces (about 15s.), and an amphora (or jar) of\r\nwine. The payments were equivalent to 2s. a year, or 2d. per mouth, the\r\nfuneral money being 45s., a fixed portion, 7s. 6d. being set apart for\r\ndistribution at the burning of the body. Members who did not pay up\r\npromptly were struck off the list, and the secretaries and treasurers,\r\nwhen funds were short, went to their own pockets.--The first Act for\r\nregulating Friendly Societies was passed in 1795. Few towns in England\r\nhave more sick and benefit clubs than Birmingham, there not being many\r\npublic-houses without one attached to them, and scarcely a manufactory\r\nminus its special fund for like purposes. The larger societies, of\r\ncourse, have many branches (lodges, courts, &c), and it would be a\r\ndifficult matter to particularise them all, or even arrive at the\r\naggregate number of their members, which, however, cannot be much less\r\nthan 50,000; and, if to these we add the large number of what may be\r\nstyled \"annual gift clubs\" (the money in hand being divided every year),\r\nwe may safely put the total at something like 70,000 persons who take\r\nthis method of providing for a rainy day. The following notes respecting\r\nlocal societies have been culled from blue books, annual reports, and\r\nprivate special information, the latter being difficult to arrive at, in\r\nconsequence of that curious reticence observable in the character of\r\nofficials of all sorts, club stewards included.\r\n\r\n_Artisans at Large_.--In March,  1868, the Birmingham artisans who\r\nreported on the Paris Exhibition of 1867, formed themselves into a\r\nsociety \"to consider and discuss, from an artisan point of view, all\r\nsuch subjects as specially affect the artisan class; to promote and seek\r\nto obtain all such measures, legislative or otherwise, as shall appear\r\nbeneficial to that class; and to render to each other mutual assistance,\r\ncounsel, or encouragement.\" Very good, indeed! The benefits which have\r\narisen from the formation of this society are doubtless many, but as the\r\nwriter has never yet seen a report, he cannot record the value of the\r\nmutual assistance rendered, or say what capital is left over of the\r\noriginal, fund of counsel and encouragement.\r\n\r\n_Barbers_.--A few knights of the razor in 1869 met together and formed a\r\n\"Philanthropic Society of Hairdressers,\" but though these gentlemen are\r\nproverbial for their gossiping propensities, they tell no tales out of\r\nschool, and of their charity boast not.\r\n\r\n_Butchers_.--A Butchers'  Benefit and Benevolent Association was founded\r\nin 1877.\r\n\r\n_Coaldealers_.--The salesmen of black diamonds have a mutual benefit\r\nassociation, but as the secretary declines to give any information, we\r\nfear the mutual benefit consists solely of helping each other to keep\r\nthe prices up.\r\n\r\n_Cannon Street Male Adult Provident Institution_ was established in\r\n1841. At the expiration of 1877 there were 8,994 members, with a balance\r\nin hand of £72,956 15s. 5d. The total received from members to that date\r\namounted to £184,900, out of which £131,400 had been returned in sick\r\npay and funeral benefits, the payments out varying from 4s. to 20s. a\r\nweek in sickness, with a funeral benefit of £20, £8 being allowed on the\r\ndeath of a wife.\r\n\r\n_Carr's Lane Provident Institution_ was commenced in 1845, and has 299\r\nmale and 323 female members, with a capital of £5,488, the amount paid\r\nin 1883 on account of sickness being £242, with £54 funeral money.\r\n\r\n_Chemistry_.--A Midland Counties' Chemists' Association was formed in\r\nMay, 1869.\r\n\r\n_Christ Church Provident Institution_ was established in 1835, and at\r\nthe end of 1883, there were 646 male and 591 female members; during the\r\nyear £423 had been paid among 138 members on account of sickness,\r\nbesides £25 for funerals. Capital about £5,800. A junior or Sunday\r\nschool branch also exists.\r\n\r\n_Church of the Saviour Provident Institution_ was started in 1857.\r\n\r\n_Church School Teachers_.--The Birmingham and District Branch of the\r\nChurch Schoolmaster's and Schoolmistresses' Benevolent Institution was\r\nformed in 1866, and the members contribute about £250 per year to the\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n_Druids_.--The order of Druids has five Lodges here, with nearly 400\r\nmembers. The United Ancient Order of Druids has twenty-one Lodges, and\r\nabout 1,400 members.\r\n\r\n_Ebenezer Chapel Sick Society_ was established in 1828. Has 135 members,\r\nwhose yearly payments average 32s. 6d., out of which 17s. dividend at\r\nChristmas comes back, the benefits being 10s. a week in sickness and £10\r\nat death.\r\n\r\n_Foresters_.--In 1745 a few Yorkshire-men started \"The Ancient Order of\r\nRoyal Foresters,\" under which title the associated Courts remained until\r\n1834, when a split took place. The secessionists, who gave the name of\r\n\"Honour\" to their No. 1 Court (at Ashton-under-Lyne), declined the\r\nhonour of calling themselves \"Royal,\" but still adhered to the antique\r\npart of their cognomen. The new \"Ancient Order of foresters\" throve\r\nwell, and, leaving their \"Royal\" friends far away in the background, now\r\nnumber 560,000 members, who meet in nearly 7,000 Courts. In the\r\nBirmingham Midland District them are 62 courts, with about 6,200\r\nmembers, the Court funds amounting to £29,900, and the District funds to\r\n£2,200. The oldest Court in this town is the \"Child of the Forest,\"\r\nmeeting at the Gem Vaults, Steelhouse Lane, which was instituted in\r\n1839. The other Courts meet at the Crown and Anchor, Gem Street;\r\nRoebuck, Lower Hurst Street; Queen's Arms, Easy Row; White Swan, Church\r\nStreet; Red Cow, Horse Fair; Crown, Broad Street; White Hart, Warstone\r\nLane; Rose and Crown, Summer Row; Red Lion, Suffolk Street; Old Crown,\r\nDeritend; Hope and Anchor, Coleshill Street; Black Horse, Ashted Row;\r\nColemore Arms, Latimer Street South; Anchor, Bradford Street; Army and\r\nNavy Inn, Great Brook Street; Red Lion, Smallbrook Street; Union Mill\r\nInn, Holt Street; Vine, Lichfield Road; Wellington, Holliday Street;\r\nRyland Arms, Ryland Street; Star and Garter, Great Hampton Row; Oak\r\nTree, Selly Oak; Station Inn, Saltley Road; Drovers' Arms, Bradford\r\nStreet; Old Nelson, Great Lister Street; Ivy Green, Edward Street; Iron\r\nHouse, Moor Street; Green Man, Harborne; Fountain, Wrentham Street;\r\nKing's Arms, Sherlock Street; Shareholders' Arms, Park Lane;\r\nShakespeare's Head, Livery Street; Criterion, Hurst Street; Acorn,\r\nFriston Street; Hen and Chickens, Graham Street; Albion, Aston Road; Dog\r\nand Partridge, Tindal Street; White Horse, Great Colmore Street;\r\nCarpenters' Arms, Adelaide Street; Small Arms Inn, Muntz Street;\r\nWeymouth Arms, Gerrard Street; General Hotel, Tonk Street; Railway\r\nTavern, Hockley; Noah's Ark, Montague Street; Sportsman, Warwick Road;\r\nRoebuck, Monument Road; Bull's Head, Moseley; Swan Inn, Coleshill; Hare\r\nand Hounds, King's Heath; Roebuck, Erdington; Fox and Grapes, Pensnett;\r\nHazelwell Tavern, Stirchley Street; Round Oak and New Inn, Brierley\r\nHill; The Stores, Oldbury; and at the Crosswells Inn, Five Ways,\r\nLangley.\r\n\r\n_General Provident and Benevolent Institution_ was at first (1833) an\r\namalgamation of several Sunday School societies. It has a number of\r\nbranches, and appears to be in a flourishing condition, the assets, at\r\nend of 1883, amounting to over £48,000, with a yearly increment of about\r\n£1,400; the number of members in the medical fund being 5,112.\r\n\r\n_Grocers_.--These gentlemen organised a Benevolent Society, in 1872.\r\n\r\n_Independent Order of Rechabites_.--Dwellers in tents, and drinkers of\r\nno wine, were the original Rechabites, and there are about a score of\r\n\"tents\" in this district, the oldest being pitched in this town in 1839,\r\nand, as friendly societies, they appear to be doing, in their way, good\r\nservice, like their friends who meet in \"courts\" and \"lodges,\" the\r\noriginal \"tent's\" cashbox having £675 in hand for cases of sickness,\r\nwhile the combined camp holds £1,600 wherewith to bury their dead.\r\n\r\n_Jewellers' Benevolent Association_ dates from Oct. 25, 1867.\r\n\r\n_Medical_.--A Midland Medical Benevolent Society has been in existence\r\nsince 1821. The annual report to end of 1883 showed invested funds\r\namounting to £10,937, there being 265 benefit members and 15 honorary.\r\n\r\n_Musical_.--The Birmingham Musical Society consists almost solely of\r\nmembers of the Choral Society, whose fines, with small subscriptions\r\nfrom honorary members, furnishes a fund to cover rehearsal, and sundry\r\nchoir expenses as well as 10s in cases of sickness.\r\n\r\n_New Meeting Provident Institution_ was founded in 1836, but is now\r\nconnected with the Church of the Messiah. A little over a thousand\r\nmembers, one-third of whom are females.\r\n\r\n_Oddfellows_.--The National Independent Order of Oddfellows, Birmingham\r\nBranch, was started about 1850. At the end of 1879 there were 1,019\r\nmembers, with about £4,500 accumulated funds.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham District of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows in\r\nJanuary, 1882, consisted of 43 lodges, comprising 4,297 members, the\r\ncombined capital of sick and funeral funds being £42,210. Tho oldest\r\nLodge in the District is the \"Briton's Pride,\" which was opened in 1827.\r\n\r\nThe first Oddfellows' Hall was in King Street, but was removed when New\r\nStreet Station was built. The new Oddfellows' Hall in Upper Temple\r\nStreet was built in 1849, by Branson and Gwyther, from the designs of\r\nCoe and Goodwin (Lewisham, Kent), at a cost of £3,000. Tim opening was\r\ncelebrated by a dinner on December 3rd, same year. The \"Hall\" will\r\naccommodate 1,000 persons. The Oddfellows' Biennial Moveable Committee\r\nmet in this town on May 29th, 1871.\r\n\r\nThe M.U. Lodges meet at the following houses:--Fox, Fox Street; White\r\nHorse, Congreve Street; Swan-with-two-Necks, Great Brook Street; Albion,\r\nCato Street North; Hope and Anchor, Coleshill Street; 13, Temple Street;\r\nWagon and Horses, Edgbaston Street; Crystal Palace, Six Ways, Smethwick;\r\nThe Vine, Harborne; Prince Arthur, Arthur Street, Small Heath; George\r\nHotel, High Street, Solihull; Bell, Phillip Street; Bull's Head,\r\nDigbeth; Edgbaston Tavern, Lee Bank, Road; The Stork, Fowler Street,\r\nNechells; Three Tuns, Digbeth; Town Hall, Sutton Coldfield; Coffee\r\nHouse, Bell Street; Coach and Horses, Snow Hill; Roe Buck, Moor Street;\r\nDrovers' Arms, Bradford Street; Co-operative Meeting Room, Stirchley\r\nStreet; Black Lion, Coleshill Street; Queen's Head, Handsworth; No. 1\r\nCoffee House, Rolfe Street, Smethwick; New Inn, Selly Oak; Wagon and\r\nHorses, Greet; Talbot, Yardley; Saracen's Head, Edgbaston Street;\r\nDolphin, Unett Street; Grand Turk, Ludgate Hill; Roebuck, Moor Street;\r\nWhite Swan, Church Street; White Lion, Thorpe Street; Queen's Arms, Easy\r\nRow; Rose and Crown, Wheeler Street, Lozells.\r\n\r\nThe National Independent Order was instituted in 1845, and registered\r\nunder the Friendly Societies' Act, 1875. The Order numbers over 60,000\r\nmembers, but its strongholds appear to be in Yorkshire and Lancashire,\r\nwhich two counties muster between them nearly 40,000. In Birmingham\r\ndistrict, there are thirteen \"lodges,\" with a total of 956 members,\r\ntheir locations being at the Criterion, Hurst Street; Bricklayers' Arms,\r\nCheapside; Ryland Arms, Ryland Street; Sportsman, Moseley Street; Iron\r\nHouse, Moor Street; Exchange Inn, High Street; Red Lion, Smallbrook\r\nStreet; Woodman, Summer Lane; Emily Arms, Emily Street; Boar's Head,\r\nBradford Street; Turk's Head, Duke Street; Bird-in-Hand, Great King\r\nStreet; Tyburn House, Erdington.\r\n\r\n_Old Meeting Friendly Fund_ was commenced in 1819, and registered in\r\n1824. Its capital at the close of the first year, was £5 14s. 10-1/2d.;\r\nat end of the tenth year (1828) it was nearly £264; in 1838, £646; in\r\n1848, £1,609; in 1858, £3,419; 1868, £5,549; in 1878, £8,237; and at the\r\nend of 1883, £9,250 16s. 2d.;--a very fair sum, considering the numbers\r\nonly numbered 446, the year's income being £877 and the out-goings £662.\r\n\r\n_Railway Guards' Friendly Fund_ was originated in this town in 1848. It\r\nhas nearly 2,200 members; the yearly disbursements being about £6,000,\r\nand the payments £40 at death, with life pensions of 10s. and upwards\r\nper week to members disabled on the line. More than £85,000 has been\r\nthus distributed since the commencement.\r\n\r\n_Roman Catholic_.--A local Friendly Society was founded in 1794, and a\r\nMidland Association in 1824.\r\n\r\n_Shepherds_.--The Order of Shepherds dates from 1834, but we cannot get\r\nat the number of members, &c. August 9, 1883 (according to _Daily\r\nPost_), the High Sanctuary meeting of the Order of Shepherds was held in\r\nour Town Hall, when the auditor's report showed total assets of the\r\ngeneral fund, £921 15s. 4d., and liabilities £12 6s. 9-1/2d. The relief\r\nfund stood at £292 18s. 8d., being an increase of £66 0s. 11d. on the\r\nyear; and there was a balance of £6 13s. 9-1/2d. to the credit of the\r\nsick and funeral fund.\r\n\r\n_St. David's Society_.--The members held their first meeting March 1,\r\n1824.\r\n\r\n_St. Patrick's Benefit Society_, dating from 1865 as an offshoot of the\r\nLiverpool Society, had at end of 1882, 3,144 members, the expenditure of\r\nthe year was £857 (£531 for funerals), and the total value of the\r\nsociety £2,030.\r\n\r\n_Unitarian Brotherly Society_, registered in 1825, has about 500\r\nmembers, and a capital of £8,500.\r\n\r\n_United Brothers_.--There are nearly 100 lodges and 10,000 members of\r\nsocieties under this name in Birmingham and neighbourhood, some of the\r\nlodges being well provided for capital, No. 4 having £8,286 to 186\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n_United Family_ Life Assurance and Sick Benefit Society claims to have\r\nsome 8,500 members, 750 of whom reside in Birmingham.\r\n\r\n_United Legal_ Burial Society, registered in 1846, like the above, is a\r\nbranch only.\r\n\r\n_Union Provident Sick Society_.--Founded 1802, enrolled in 1826 and\r\ncertified in 1871, had then 3,519 members and a reserve fund of £8,269.\r\nAt end of 1883 the reserve fund stood at £15,310 16s. 9d., there having\r\nbeen paid during the year £4,768 17s. 2d. for sick pay and funerals,\r\nbesides 15s. dividend to each member.\r\n\r\nThere are 15,379 Friendly Societies or branches in the kingdom,\r\nnumbering 4,593,175 members, and their funds amounted to (by last\r\nreturn) £12,148,602.\r\n\r\n~Friends (The Society of).~--Quakerism was publicly professed here in\r\n1654, George Fox visiting the town the following year and in 1657. The\r\ntriends held their first \"meetings\" in Monmouth Street in 1659. The\r\nmeeting-house in Bull Street was built in 1703, and was enlarged several\r\ntimes prior to 1856, when it was replaced by the present edifice which\r\nwill seat about 800 persons. The re-opening took place January 25, 1857.\r\nThe burial-ground in Monmouth Street, where the Arcade is now, was taken\r\nby the Great Western Railway Co. in 1851, the remains of over 300\r\ndeparted Friends being removed to the yard of the meeting-house in Bull\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n~Froggery.~--Before the New Street Railway Station was built, a fair\r\nslice of old Birmingham had to be cleared away, and fortunately it\r\nhappened to be one of the unsavoury portions, including the spot known\r\nas \"The Froggery.\" As there was a Duck Lane close by, the place most\r\nlikely was originally so christened from its lowlying and watery\r\nposition, the connection between ducks and frogs being self-apparent.\r\n\r\n~Frosts.~--Writing on Jan. 27, 1881, the late Mr. Plant said that in 88\r\nyears there had been only four instances of great cold approaching\r\ncomparison with the intense frost then ended; the first was in January,\r\n1795; the next in December and January, 1813-14; then followed that of\r\nJanuary, 1820. The fourth was in December and January, 1860-61; and,\r\nlastly, January, 1881. In 1795 the mean temperature of the twenty-one\r\ndays ending January 31st was 24.27 degrees; in 1813-14, December 29th to\r\nJanuary 18th, exclusively, 24.9 degrees; in 1820, January 1st to 21st,\r\ninclusively, 23.7 degrees; in 1860-61, December 20th to January 9th,\r\ninclusively, 24.5 degrees; and in 1881, January 7th to 27th,\r\ninclusively, 23.2 degrees. Thus the very coldest three weeks on record\r\nin this district, in 88 years, is January, 1881. With the exception of\r\nthe long frost of 1813-4, which commenced on the 24th December and\r\nlasted three months, although so intense in their character, none of the\r\nabove seasons were remarkable for protracted duration. The longest\r\nfrosts recorded in the present century were as follows:--1813-14,\r\nDecember to March. 13 weeks; 1829-30, December, January, February, 10\r\nweeks; 1838, January, February, 8 weeks; 1855, January, February, 7\r\nweeks; 1878-79, December, January, February, 10 weeks.\r\n\r\n~Funny Notions.~--The earliest existing statutes governing our Free\r\nGrammar of King Edward VI. bear the date of 1676. One of these rules\r\nforbids the assistant masters to marry.--In 1663 (_temp_. Charles II.)\r\nSir Robert Holte, of Aston, received a commission from Lord Northampton,\r\n\"Master of His Majesty's leash,\" to take and seize greyhounds, and\r\ncertain other dogs, for the use of His Majesty!--The \"Dancing Assembly,\"\r\nwhich was to meet on the 30th January, 1783, loyally postponed their\r\nlight fantastic toeing, \"in consequence of that being the anniversary of\r\nthe martyrdom of Charles I.\"--In 1829, when the Act was passed\r\nappointing Commissioners for Duddeston and Nechells, power was given for\r\nerecting gasworks, provided they did not extend over more than one acre,\r\nand that no gas was sent into the adjoining parish of Birmingham.--A\r\nwriter in _Mechanics' Magazine_ for 1829, who signed his name as \"A.\r\nTaydhill, Birmingham,\" suggested that floor carpets should be utilized\r\nas maps where with to teach children geography. The same individual\r\nproposed that the inhabitants of each street should join together to buy\r\na long pole, or mast, with a rope and pulley, for use as a fireescape,\r\nand recommended them to convey their furniture in or out of the windows\r\nwith it, as \"good practice.\"--A patent was taken out by Eliezer Edwards,\r\nin 1853, for a bedstead fitted with a wheel and handle, that it might be\r\nused as a wheelbarrow.--Sergeant Bates, of America, invaded Birmingham,\r\nNov. 21, 1872, carrying the \"stars and stripes,\" as a test of our love\r\nfor our Yankee cousins.\r\n\r\n~Funeral Reform.~--An association for doing away with the expensive\r\ncustoms so long connected with the burying of the dead, was organised in\r\n1875, and slowly, but surely, are accomplishing the task then entered\r\nupon. At present there are about 700 enrolled members, but very many\r\nmore families now limit the trappings of woe to a more reasonable as\r\nwell as economical exhibit of tailors' and milliners' black.\r\n\r\n~Furniture.~--Judging from some old records appertaining to the history\r\nof a very ancient family, who, until the town swallowed it up, farmed a\r\nconsiderable portion of the district known as the Lozells, or Lowcells,\r\nas it was once called, even our well-to-do neighbours would appear to\r\nhave been rather short of what we think necessary household furniture.\r\nAs to chairs in bedrooms, there were often none; and if they had\r\nchimnies, only movable grates, formed of a few bars resting on \"dogs.\"\r\nWindow-curtains, drawers, carpets, and washing-stands, are not,\r\naccording to our recollection, anywhere specified; and a warming-pan\r\ndoes not occur till 1604, and then was kept in the bed-room. Tongs\r\nappear as annexations of grates, without poker or shovel; and the family\r\nplate-chest was part of bed-room furniture. Stools were the substitutes\r\nfor chairs in the principal sitting-room, in the proportion of even\r\ntwenty of the former to two of the latter, which were evidently\r\nintended, _par distinction_, for the husband and wife.\r\n\r\n~Galton.~--The family name of a once well-known firm of gun, sword, and\r\nbayonet makers, whose town-house was in Steelhouse Lane, opposite the\r\nUpper Priory. Their works were close by in Weaman Street, but the mill\r\nfor grinding and polishing the barrels and blades was at Duddeston, near\r\nto Duddeston Hall, the Galton's country-house. It was this firm's\r\nmanufactury that Lady Selbourne refers to in her \"Diary,\" wherein she\r\nstates that in 1765 she went to a Quaker's \"to see the making of guns.\"\r\nThe strange feature of members of the peace-loving Society of Friends\r\nbeing concerned in the manufacture of such death-dealing implements was\r\nso contrary to their profession, that in 1796, the Friends strongly\r\nremonstrated with the Galtons, leading to the retirement of the senior\r\npartner from the trade, and the expulsion of the junior from the body.\r\nThe mansion in Steelhouse Lane was afterwards converted into a\r\nbanking-house; then used for the purposes of the Polytechnic\r\nInstitution; next, after a period of dreary emptiness, fitted up as the\r\nChildren's Hospital, after the removal of which to Broad Street, the old\r\nhouse has reverted to its original use, as the private abode of Dr.\r\nClay.\r\n\r\n~Gambetta.~--The eminent French patriot was fined 2,000 francs for\r\nupholding the freedom of speech and the rights of the press, two things\r\never dear to Liberal Birmingham, and it was proposed to send him the\r\nmoney from here as a mark of esteem and sympathy. The _Daily Post_ took\r\nthe matter in hand, and, after appealing to its 40,000 readers every day\r\nfor some weeks, forwarded (November 10, 1877) a draft for £80 17s. 6d.\r\n\r\n~Gaols.~--The Town Gaol, or Lockup, at the back of the Public Office, in\r\nMoor-street, was first used in September, 1806. It then consisted of a\r\ncourtyard, 59 ft. by 30 ft. (enclosed by a 26 ft. wall) two day rooms or\r\nkitchens, 14 ft. square, and sixteen sleeping cells, 8 ft. by 6 ft. The\r\nprisoners' allowance was a pennyworth of bread and a slice of cheese\r\ntwice a day, and the use of the pump. Rather short commons, considering\r\nthe 4 lb. loaf often sold at 1s. The establishment, which is vastly\r\nimproved and much enlarged, is now used only as a place of temporary\r\ndetention or lockup, where prisoners are first received, and wait their\r\nintroduction to the gentlemen of the bench.  The erection of the Borough\r\nGaol was commenced on October 29, 1845, and it was opened for the\r\nreception of prisoners, October 17, 1849, the first culprit being\r\nreceived two days afterwards. The estimated cost was put at £51,447, but\r\naltogether it cost the town about £90,000, about £70,000 of which has\r\nbeen paid off. In the year 1877, three prisoners contrived to escape;\r\none, John Sutcliffe, who got out on July 25, not being recaptured till\r\nthe 22nd of January following. The others were soon taken back home. The\r\ngaol was taken over by the government as from April 1, 1878, Mr. J.W.\r\nPreston, being appointed Governor at a salary of £510, in place of Mr.\r\nMeaden, who had received £450, with certain extras.--See \"_Dungeon_\" and\r\n\"_Prisons_.\"  The new County Goal at Warwick was first occupied in 1860.\r\n\r\n~Gaol Atrocities.~--The first Governor appointed to the Borough Gaol was\r\nCaptain Maconochie, formerly superintendent over the convicts at Norfolk\r\nIsland in the days of transportation of criminals. He was permitted to\r\ntry as an experiment a \"system of marks,\" whereby a prisoner, by his\r\ngood conduct and industry, could materially lessen the duration of his\r\npunishment, and, to a certain extent improve his dietary. The\r\nexperiment, though only tried with prisoners under sixteen, proved very\r\nsuccessful, and at one time hopes were entertained that the system would\r\nbecome general in all the gaols of the kingdom. So far as our gaol was\r\nconcerned, however, it proved rather unfortunate that Captain\r\nMaconochie, through advancing age and other causes, was obliged to\r\nresign his position (July, 1851), for upon the appointment of his\r\nsuccessor, Lieutenant Austin, a totally opposite course of procedure was\r\nintroduced, a perfect reign of terror prevailing in place of kindness\r\nand a humane desire to lead to the reformation of criminals. In lieu of\r\ngood marks for industry, the new Governor imposed heavy penal marks if\r\nthe tasks set them were not done to time, and what these tasks were may\r\nbe gathered from the fact that in sixteen months no less than fifteen\r\nprisoners were driven to make an attempt on their lives, through the\r\nmisery and torture to which they were exposed, three unfortunates being\r\nonly too successful. Of course such things could not be altogether\r\nhushed up, and after one or two unsatisfactory \"inquiries\" had been\r\nheld, a Royal Commission was sent down to investigate matters. One case\r\nout of many will be sufficient sample of the mercies dealt out by the\r\ngovernor to the poor creatures placed under his care. Edward Andrews, a\r\nlad of 15, was sent to gaol for three months (March 28, 1853) for\r\nstealing a piece of beef. On the second day he was put to work at \"the\r\ncrank,\" every turn of which was equal to lifting a weight of 20lbs., and\r\nhe was required to make 2,000 revolutions before he had any breakfast,\r\n4,000 more before dinner, and another 4,000 before supper, the\r\npunishment for not completing either of these tasks being the loss of\r\nthe meal following. The lad failed on many occasions, and was fed almost\r\nsolely on one daily, or, rather, nightly allowance of bread and water.\r\nFor shouting he was braced to a wall for hours at a time, tightly cased\r\nin a horrible jacket and leather collar, his feet being only moveable.\r\nIn this position, when exhausted almost to death, he was restored to\r\nsensibility by having buckets of water thrown over him. What wonder that\r\nwithin a month he hung himself. A number of similar cases of brutality\r\nwere proved, and the Governor thought it best to resign, but he was not\r\nallowed to escape altogether scot free, being tried at Warwick on\r\nseveral charges of cruelty, and being convicted, was sentenced by the\r\nCourt of Queen's Bench to a term of three months' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n~Garibaldi.~--At a meeting of the Town Council, April 5, 1865, it was\r\nresolved to ask Garibaldi to pay a visit to this town, but he declined\r\nthe honour, as in the year previous he had similarly declined to receive\r\nan offered town subscription.\r\n\r\n~Garrison.~--Though a strong force was kept in the Barracks in the old\r\ndays of riot and turbulence, it is many years since we have been\r\nfavoured with more than a single company of red coats at a time, our\r\npeaceful inland town not requiring a strong garrison.\r\n\r\n~Gardens.~--A hundred to 150 years ago there was no town in England\r\nbetter supplied with gardens than Birmingham, almost every house in what\r\nare now the main thoroughfares having its plot of garden ground. In 1731\r\nthere were many acres of allotment gardens (as they came to be called at\r\na later date) where St. Bartholomew's Church now stands, and in almost\r\nevery other direction similar pieces of land were to be seen under\r\ncultivation. Public tea gardens were also to be found in several\r\nquarters of the outskirts; the establishment known as the Spring Gardens\r\nclosing its doors July 31, 1801. The Apollo Tea Gardens lingered on till\r\n1846, and Beach's Gardens closed in September, 1854.\r\n\r\n~Gas.~--William Murdoch is generally credited with the introduction of\r\nlighting by gas, but it is evident that the inflammability of the gas\r\nproducible from coal was known long before his day, as the Rev. Dr. John\r\nClayton, Dean of Kildare, mentioned it in a letter he wrote to the Hon.\r\nRobert Boyle, in 1691. The Dr.'s discovery was probably made during his\r\nstay in Virginia, and another letter of his shows the probability of his\r\nbeing aware that the gas would pass through water without losing its\r\nlighting properties. The discovery has also been claimed as that of a\r\nlearned French _savant_ but Murdoch must certainly take the honour of\r\nbeing the first to bring gas into practical use at his residence, at\r\nRedruth, in 1792, and it is said that he even made a lantern to light\r\nthe paths in his evening walks, the gas burned in which was contained in\r\na bag carried under his arm, his rooms being also lit up from a bag of\r\ngas placed under weights. The exact date of its introduction in this\r\nneighbourhood has not been ascertained though it is believed that part\r\nof the Soho Works were fitted with gas-lights in 1798, and, on the\r\noccurrence of the celebration of the Peace of Amiens, in 1802, a public\r\nexhibition was made of the new light, in the illumination of the works.\r\nThe _Gazette_ of April 5, 1802 (according to extract by Dr. Langford, in\r\nhis \"Century of Birmingham Life\") described the various devices in\r\ncoloured lamps and transparencies, but strangely enough does not mention\r\ngas at all. Possibly gas was no longer much of a novelty at Soho, or the\r\nreporter might not have known the nature of the lights used, but there\r\nis the evidence of Mr. Wm. Matthews, who, in 1827 published an\r\n\"Historical Sketch of Gaslighting,\" in which he states that he had \"the\r\ninexpressible gratification of witnessing, in 1802, Mr. Murdoch's\r\nextraordinary and splendid exhibition of gaslights at Soho.\" On the\r\nother hand, the present writer was, some years back, told by one of the\r\nfew old Soho workmen then left among us, that on the occasion referred\r\nto the only display of gas was in the shape of one large lamp placed at\r\none end of the factory, and then called a \"Bengal light,\" the gas for\r\nwhich was brought to the premises in several bags from Mr. Murdoch's own\r\nhouse. Though it has been always believed that the factory and offices\r\nthroughout were lighted by gas in 1803, very soon after the Amiens\r\nillumination, a correspondent to the _Daily Post_ has lately stated that\r\nwhen certain of his friends went to Soho, in 1834, they found no lights\r\nin use, even for blowpipes, except oil and candles and that they had to\r\nlay on gas from the mains of the Birmingham and Staffordshire Gas\r\nCompany in the Holyhead Road. If correct, this is a curious bit of the\r\nhistory of the celebrated Soho, as other manufacturers were not at all\r\nslow in introducing gas for working purposes as well as lighting, a\r\nwell-known tradesman, Benjamin Cook, Caroline Street, having fitted up\r\nretorts and a gasometer on his premises in 1808, his first pipes being\r\ncomposed of old or waste gun-barrels, and he reckoned to clear a profit\r\nof £30 a year, as against his former expenditure for candles and oil.\r\nThe glassworks of Jones, Smart, and Co., of Aston Hill, were lit up by\r\ngas as early as 1810, 120 burners being used at a nightly cost of 4s.\r\n6d., the gas being made on the premises from a bushel of coal per day.\r\nThe first proposal to use gas in lighting the streets of Birmingham was\r\nmade in July 1811, and here and there a lamp soon appeared, but they\r\nwere supplied by private firms, one of whom afterwards supplied gas to\r\nlight the chapel formerly on the site of the present Assay Office,\r\ntaking it from their works in Caroline Street, once those of B. Cook\r\nbefore-mentioned. The Street Commissioners did not take the matter in\r\nhand till 1815, on November 8 of which year they advertised for tenders\r\nfor lighting the streets with gas instead of oil. The first shop in\r\nwhich gas was used was that of Messrs. Poultney, at the corner of Moor\r\nStreet, in 1818, the pipes being laid from the works in Gas Street by a\r\nprivate individual, whose interest therein was bought up by the\r\nBirmingham Gaslight Company. The principal streets were first officially\r\nlighted by gas-lamps on April 29, 1826, but it was not until March,\r\n1843, that the Town Council resolved that that part of the borough\r\nwithin the parish of Edgbaston should be similarly favoured.\r\n\r\n~Gas Companies.~--The first, or Birmingham Gaslight Co. was formed in\r\n1817, incorporated in 1819, and commenced business by buying up the\r\nprivate adventurer who built the works in Gas Street. The Company was\r\nlimited to the borough of Birmingham, and its original capital was\r\n£32,000, which, by an Act obtained in 1855, was increased to £300,000,\r\nand borrowing powers to £90,000 more, the whole of which was raised or\r\npaid up. In the year 1874 the company supplied gas through 17,000\r\nmeters, which consumed 798,000,000 cubic feet of gas. The Birmingham and\r\nStaffordshire Gas Co. was established in 1825, and had powers to lay\r\ntheir mains in and outside the borough. The original Act was repealed in\r\n1845, the company being remodelled and started afresh with a capital of\r\n£320,000, increased by following Acts to £670,000 (all called up by\r\n1874), and borrowing powers to £100,000, of which, by the same year\r\n£23,000 had been raised. The consumption of gas in 1874 was\r\n1,462,000,000 cubic feet, but how much of this was burnt by the\r\ncompany's 19,910 Birmingham customers, could not be told. The two\r\ncompanies, though rivals for the public favour, did not undersell one\r\nanother, both of them charging 10/-per 1,000 feet in the year 1839,\r\nwhile in 1873 large consumers were only charged 2/3 per 1,000 feet, the\r\nhighest charge being 2/7. The question of buying out both of the Gas\r\nCompanies had been frequently mooted, but it was not until 1874 that any\r\ndefinite step was taken towards the desired end. On April 17th, 1874,\r\nthe burgesses recorded 1219 votes in favour of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain's\r\nproposition to purchase the Gas [and the Water] Works, 683 voting\r\nagainst it. On Jan. 18th, 1875, the necessary Bills were introduced into\r\nthe House of Commons, and on July 15th and 19th, the two Acts were\r\npassed, though not without some little opposition from the outlying\r\nparishes and townships heretofore supplied by the Birmingham and\r\nStaffordshire Co., to satisfy whom a clause was inserted, under which\r\nWalsall, West Bromwich, &c., could purchase the several mains and works\r\nin their vicinity, if desirous to do so. The Birmingham Gas Co. received\r\nfrom the Corporation £450,000, of which £136,890 was to be left on loan\r\nat 4%, as Debenture Stock, though £38,850 thereof has been kept in hand,\r\nas the whole was redeemable within ten years. The balance of £313,000\r\nwas borrowed from the public at 4%, and in some cases a little less. The\r\nBirmingham and Staffordshire Gas Co. were paid in Perpetual Annuities,\r\namounting to £58,290 per year, being the maximum dividends then payable\r\non the Co.'s shares, £10,906 was returned as capital not bearing\r\ninterest, £15,000 for surplus profits, £30,000 the half-year's dividend,\r\nand also £39,944 5s. 4d. the Co's Reserve Fund. The total cost was put\r\ndown as £1,900,000. The Annuities are redeemable by a Sinking Fund in 85\r\nyears. For their portion of the mains, service pipes, works, &c.\r\nformerly belonging to the Birmingham and Staffordshire Company, the\r\nWalsall authorities pay the Corporation an amount equivalent to\r\nannuities valued at £1,300 per year; Oldbury paid £22,750, Tipton\r\n£34,700, and West Bromwich £70,750.\r\n\r\n~Gas Fittings.~--Curious notions appear to have been at first\r\nentertained as to the explosive powers of the new illuminator, nothing\r\nless than copper or brass being considered strong enough for the\r\ncommonest piping, and it was thought a great innovation when a local\r\nmanufacturer, in 1812, took out a patent for lead pipes copper-coated.\r\nEven Murdoch himself seems to have been in dread of the burning element,\r\nfor when, in after years, his house at Sycamore Hill changed owners, it\r\nwas found that the smaller gas pipes therein were made of silver,\r\npossibly used to withstand the supposed corrosive effects of the gas.\r\nThe copper-covered lead pipes were patented in 1819 by Mr. W. Phipson,\r\nof the Dog Pool Mills, the present compo being comparatively a modern\r\nintroduction. Messengers, of Broad Street, and Cook, of Caroline Street\r\n(1810-20), were the first manufacturers of gas fittings in this town,\r\nand they appear to have had nearly a monopoly of the trade, as there\r\nwere but three others in it in 1833, and only about twenty in 1863; now\r\ntheir name is legion, gas being used for an infinitude of purposes, not\r\nthe least of which is by the gas cooking stove, the idea of which was so\r\nnovel at first that the Secretary of the Gas Office in the Minories at\r\none time introduced it to the notice of the public by having his dinner\r\ndaily cooked in a stove placed in one of the office windows. An\r\nexhibition of gas apparatus of all kinds was opened at the Town Hall,\r\nJune 5, 1878, and that there is still a wonderful future for development\r\nis shown by its being seriously advocated that a double set of mains\r\nwill be desirable, one for lighting gas, and the other for a less pure\r\nkind to be used for heating purposes.\r\n\r\n~Gas Works.~--See \"_Public Buildings_.\"\r\n\r\n~Gavazzi.~--Father Gavazzi first orated here in the Town Hall, October\r\n20, 1851.\r\n\r\n~Geographical.~--According to the Ordnance Survey, Birmingham is\r\nsituated in latitude 52° 29', and longitude 1° 54' west.\r\n\r\n~Gillott.~--See \"_Noteworthy Men_.\"\r\n\r\n~Girls' Home.~--Eighteen years ago several kind-hearted ladies opened a\r\nhouse in Bath Row, for the reception of servant girls of the poorest\r\nclass, who, through their poverty and juvenility, could not be sheltered\r\nin the \"Servants' Home,\" and that such an establishment was needed, is\r\nproved by the fact that no less than 334 inmates were sheltered for a\r\ntime during 1883, while 232 others received help in clothing &c.,\r\nsuited to their wants. The Midland Railway having taken Bath House, the\r\nHome has lately been removed to a larger house near the Queen's\r\nHospital, where the managers will be glad to receive any little aid that\r\ncan be rendered towards carrying on their charitable operations.\r\n\r\n~Glass.~--In the reign of Henry VI. the commonest kind of glass was sold\r\nat 2s. the foot, a shilling in those days being of as much value as a\r\ncrown of today. The earliest note we can find of glass being made here\r\nis the year 1785, when Isaac Hawker built a small glasshouse behind his\r\nshop at Edgbaston Street. His son built at Birmingham Heath on the site\r\nnow occupied by Lloyd and Summerfield. In 1798 Messrs. Shakespeare and\r\nJohnston had a glasshouse in Walmer Lane. Pressed glass seems to have\r\nbeen the introduction of Rice Harris about 1832, though glass \"pinchers\"\r\n(eleven of them) are named in the Directory of 1780. In 1827 plate-glass\r\nsold at 12s. per foot and in 1840 at 6s., ordinary sheet-glass being\r\nthen 1s. 2d. per foot. There was a duty on plate-glass prior to April 5,\r\n1845, of 2s. 10-1/2d. per foot. The \"patent plate\" was the invention of\r\nMr. James Chance, and Chance Brothers (of whose works a notice will be\r\nfound in another part of this book) are the only manufacturers in this\r\ncountry of glass for lighthouse purposes--See also \"_Trades_,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Godwillings.~--In olden days when our factors started on their tours\r\nfor orders, it was customary to send a circular in advance announcing\r\nthat \"God willing\" they would call upon their customers on certain\r\nspecified dates. In the language of the counting-house the printed\r\ncirculars were called \"Godwillings.\"\r\n\r\n~Goldschmidt.~--Notes of the various visits of Madame Goldschmidt,\r\nbetter known by her maiden name of Jenny Lind, will be found under the\r\nheading of \"_Musical Celebrities_.\"\r\n\r\n~Good Templars.~--The Independent Order of Good Templars, in this town,\r\nintroduced themselves in 1868, and they now claim to have 90,000 adult\r\nmembers in the \"Grand Lodge of England.\"\r\n\r\n~Gordon.~--Lord George Gordon, whose intemperate actions caused the\r\nLondon Anti-Papist Riots of 1780, was arrested in this town December 7,\r\n1787, but not for anything connected with those disgraceful proceedings.\r\nHe had been found guilty of a libel, and was arrested on a judge's\r\nwarrant, and taken from here to London, for contempt of the Court of\r\nKing's Bench in not appearing when called upon to do so. It has been\r\nmore than once averred that Lord George was circumcised here, before\r\nbeing admitted to the Jewish community, whose rites and ceremonies,\r\ndress and manners, he strictly observed and followed; but he first\r\nbecame a Jew while residing in Holland, some time before he took\r\nlodgings in such a classic locality as our old Dudley-street, where he\r\nlay hidden for nearly four months, a long beard and flowing gaberdine\r\nhelping to conceal his identity.\r\n\r\n~Gough.~--Gough Road, Gough Street, and a number of other thoroughfares\r\nhave been named after the family, from whom the present Lord Calthorpe,\r\ninherits his property.--See \"_Edgbaston Hall_.\"\r\n\r\n~Grammar School.~--See \"_Schools_.\"\r\n\r\n~Great Brooke Street~ takes its name from Mr. Brookes, an attorney of\r\nthe olden time.\r\n\r\n~Great Eastern Steamship.~--The engines for working the screw propeller,\r\n4 cylinders and 8,500 horse-power (nominal 1,700) were sent out from the\r\nSoho Foundry.\r\n\r\n~Green's Village.~--Part of the old [**]ookeries in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe [**]nkleys.\r\n\r\n~Grub Street.~--The upper part of Old Meeting Street was so called until\r\nlate years.\r\n\r\n~Guardians.~--See \"_Poor Law_.\"\r\n\r\n~Guildhall.~--The operative builders commenced to put up an edifice in\r\n1833 which they intended to call \"The Guildhall,\" but it was only half\r\nfinished when the ground was cleared for the railway. Some of the local\r\nantiquaries strongly advocated the adoption of the name \"Guildhall\" for\r\nthe block of municipal buildings and Council House, if only in\r\nremembrance of the ancient building on whose site, in New Street, the\r\nGrammar School now stands.\r\n\r\n~Guild of the Holy Cross.~--Founded in the year 1392 by the \"Bailiffs\r\nand Commonalty\" of the town of Birmingham (answering to our aldermen and\r\ncouncillors), and licensed by the Crown, for which the town paid £50,\r\nthe purpose being to \"make and found a gild and perpetual fraternity of\r\nbrethren and sustern (sisters), in honour of the Holy Cross,\" and \"to\r\nundertake all works of charity, &c., according to the appointment and\r\npleasure of the said bailiffs and commonalty.\" In course of time the\r\nGuild became possessed of all the powers then exercised by the local\r\ncorporate authorities, taking upon themselves the building of\r\nalmshouses, the relief and maintenance of the poor, the making and\r\nkeeping in repair of the highways used by \"the King's Majestie's\r\nsubjects passing to and from the marches of Wales,\" looking to the\r\npreservation of sundry bridges and lords, as well as repair of \"two\r\ngreate stone brydges,\" &c., &c. The Guild owned considerable portion of\r\nthe land on which the present town is built, when Henry VIII., after\r\nconfiscating the revenues and possessions of the monastic institutions,\r\nlaid hands on the property of such semi-religious establishments as the\r\nGuild of the Holy Cross. It has never appeared that our local Guild had\r\ndone anything to offend the King, and possibly it was but the name that\r\nhe disliked. Be that as it may, his son, Edward VI., in 1552, at the\r\npetition of the inhabitants, returned somewhat more than half of the\r\nproperty, then valued at £21 per annum, for the support and maintenance\r\nof a Free Grammar School, and it is this property from which the income\r\nof the present King Edward VI.'s Grammar Schools is now derived,\r\namounting to nearly twice as many thousands as pounds were first\r\ngranted. The Guild Hall or Town's Hall in New Street (then only a bye\r\nstreet), was not _quite_ so large as either our present Town Hall or the\r\nCouncil House, but was doubtless considered at the time a very fine\r\nbuilding, with its antique carvings and stained glass windows emblazoned\r\nwith figures and armorial bearings of the Lords right Ferrers and\r\nothers. As the Guild had an organist in its pay, it may be presumed that\r\nsuch an instrument was also there, and that alone goes far to prove the\r\nfraternity were tolerably well off, as organs in those times were costly\r\nand scarce. The old building, for more than a century after King\r\nEdward's grant, was used as the school, but even when rebuilt it\r\nretained its name as the Guild Hall.\r\n\r\n~Guns.~--Handguns, as they were once termed, were first introduced into\r\nthis country by the Flemings whom Edward IV. brought over in 1471, but\r\n(though doubtless occasional specimens were made by our townsmen before\r\nthen) the manufacture of small arms at Birmingham does not date further\r\nback than 1689, when inquiries were made through Sir Richard Newdigate\r\nas to the possibility of getting them made here as good as those coming\r\nfrom abroad. A trial order given by Government in March, 1692, led to\r\nthe first contract (Jan. 5, 1693) made between the \"Officers of\r\nOrdnance\" and five local manufacturers, for the supply of 200 \"snaphance\r\nmusquets\" every month for one year at 17/-each, an additional 3/-per\r\ncwt. being allowed for carriage to London. The history of the trade\r\nsince then would form a volume of itself, but a few facts of special\r\nnote and interest will be given in its place among \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Gutta Percha~ was not known in Europe prior to 1844, and the first\r\nspecimens were brought here in the following year. Speaking tubes made\r\nof gutta percha were introduced early in 1849.\r\n\r\n~Gymnasium.~--At a meeting held Dec. 18, 1865, under the presidency of\r\nthe Mayor, it was resolved to establish a public gymnasium on a large\r\nscale, but an present it is non-existent, the only gymnasium open being\r\nthat of the Athletic Club at Bingley Hall.\r\n\r\n~Hackney Coaches~ were introduced here in 1775. Hutton says the drivers\r\nof the first few earned 30s. per day; those of the present day say they\r\ndo not get half the sum now. Hansom Cabs, the invention, in 1836, of the\r\narchitect and designer of our Town Hall, were first put on the stands in\r\n1842.\r\n\r\n~Half-Holiday.~--Ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week, used to be\r\nthe stint for workpeople here and elsewhere. A Saturday Half-holiday\r\nmovement was begun in 1851, the first employers to adopt the system\r\nbeing Mr. John Frearson, of Gas Street (late of the Waverley Hotel,\r\nCrescent), and Mr. Richard Tangye. Wingfields, Brown, Marshall & Co.,\r\nand many other large firms began with the year 1853, when it maybe said\r\nthe plan became general.\r\n\r\n~Handsworth.~--Till within the last thirty or forty years, Handsworth\r\nwas little more than a pleasant country village, though now a\r\nwell-populated suburb of Birmingham. The name is to be found in the\r\n\"Domesday Book,\" but the ancient history of the parish is meagre indeed,\r\nand confined almost solely to the families of the lords of the manor,\r\nthe Wyrleys, Stanfords, &c., their marriages and intermarriages, their\r\nfancies and feuds, and all those petty trifles chroniclers of old were\r\nso fond of recording. After the erection of the once world-known, but\r\nnow vanished Soho Works, by Matthew Boulton, a gradual change came o'er\r\nthe scene; cultivated enclosures taking the place of the commons,\r\nenclosed in 1793; Boulton's park laid out, good roads made,\r\nwater-courses cleared, and houses and mansions springing up on all\r\nsides, and so continuing on until now, when the parish (which includes\r\nBirchfield and Perry Barr, an area of 7,680 acres in all) is nearly half\r\ncovered with streets and houses, churches and chapels, alms-houses and\r\nstations, shops, offices, schools, and all the other necessary adjuncts\r\nto a populous and thriving community. The Local Board Offices and Free\r\nLibrary, situate in Soho Road, were built in 1878 (first stone laid\r\nOctober 30th, 1877), at a cost of £20,662, and it is a handsome pile of\r\nbuildings. The library contains about 7,000 volumes. There is talk of\r\nerecting public swimming and other baths, and a faint whisper that\r\nrecreation grounds are not far from view. The 1st Volunteer Battalion of\r\nthe South Staffordshire Regiment have their head-quarters here. Old\r\nHandsworth Church, which contained several carved effigies and tombs of\r\nthe old lords, monuments of Matthew Boulton and James Watt, with bust of\r\nWilliam Murdoch, &c., has been rebuilt and enlarged, the first stone of\r\nthe new building being laid in Aug, 1876. Five of the bells in the tower\r\nwere cast in 1701, by Joseph Smith, of Edgbaston, and were the first\r\npeal sent out of his foundry; the tenor is much older. The very\r\nappropriate inscription on the fourth bell is, \"God preserve the Church\r\nof England as by law established.\"\r\n\r\n~Harborne~ is another of our near neighbours which a thousand years or\r\nso ago had a name if nothing else, but that name has come down to\r\npresent time with less change than is usual, and, possibly through the\r\nCalthorpe estate blocking the way, the parish itself has changed but\r\nvery slowly, considering its close proximity to busy, bustling\r\nBirmingham. This apparent stagnation, however, has endeared it to us\r\nBrums not a little, on account of the many pleasant glades and sunny\r\nspots in and around it. Harborne gardeners have long been famous for\r\ngrowing gooseberries, the annual dinner of the Gooseberry Growers'\r\nSociety having been held at the Green Man ever since 1815. But Harborne\r\nhas plucked up heart latterly, and will not much longer be \"out of the\r\nrunning.\" With its little area of 1,412 acres, and only a population of\r\n6,600, it has built itself an Institute (a miniature model of the\r\nMidland), with class rooms and reading rooms, with library and with\r\nlecture halls, to seat a thousand, at a cost of £6,500, and got Henry\r\nIrving to lay the foundation-stone, in 1879. A Masonic Hall followed in\r\n1880, and a Fire Brigade Station soon after. It has also a local railway\r\nas well as a newspaper. In the parish church, which was nearly all\r\nrebuilt in 1867, there are several monuments of olden date, one being in\r\nremembrance of a member of the Hinckley family, from whose name that of\r\nour Inkleys is deducible; there is also a stained window to the memory\r\nof David Cox. The practice of giving a Christmas treat, comprising a\r\ngood dinner, some small presents, and an enjoyable entertainment to the\r\naged poor, was begun in 1865, and is still kept up.\r\n\r\n~Hard Times.~--Food was so dear and trade so bad in 1757 that Lord\r\nDartmouth for a long time relieved 500 a week out of his own pocket. In\r\n1782 bread was sold to the poor at one-third under its market value. On\r\nthe 1st of July, 1795, the lessee of the Theatre Royal, Mr. McCready,\r\ngave the proceeds of the night's performance (£161 8s.) for the benefit\r\nof the poor. The money was expended in wheat, which was sold free of\r\ncarriage. Meat was also very scarce on the tables of the poor, and a\r\npublic subscription was opened by the High Bailiff to enable meat to be\r\nsold at 1d. per lb. under the market price, which then ruled at 3d. to\r\n6d. per lb. In November, 1799, wheat was 15s. per bushel. In May, 1800,\r\nthe distressed poor were supplied with wheat at the \"reduced price\" of\r\n15s. per bushel, and potatoes at 8s. per peck. Soup kitchens for the\r\npoor were opened November 30, 1816, when 3,000 quarts were sold the\r\nfirst day. The poor-rates, levied in 1817, amounted to £61,928, and it\r\nwas computed that out of a population of 84,000 at least 27,000 were in\r\nreceipt of parish relief. In 1819 £5,500 was collected to relieve the\r\ndistressed poor. The button makers were numbered at 17,000 in 1813,\r\ntwo-thirds of them being out of work. 1825 and 1836 were terrible years\r\nof poverty and privation in this town and neighbourhood. In 1838,\r\n380,000 doles were made to poor people from a fund raised by public\r\nsubscription. In the summer of 1840, local trade was so bad that we have\r\nbeen told as many as 10,000 persons applied at one office alone for free\r\npassages to Australia, and all unsuccessfully. Empty houses could be\r\ncounted by the hundred. There was great distress in the winter of\r\n1853-4, considerable amounts being subscribed for charitable relief. In\r\nthe first three months of 1855, there were distributed among the poor\r\n11,745 loaves of bread, 175,500 pints of soup, and £725 in cash. The sum\r\nof £10,328 was subscribed for and expended in the relief of the\r\nunemployed in the winter of 1878-79--the number of families receiving\r\nthe same being calculated at 195,165, with a total of 494,731 persons.\r\n\r\n~Harmonies.~--See \"_Musical Societies_.\"\r\n\r\n~Hats and Hatters.~--In 1820 there was but one hatter in the town, Harry\r\nEvans, and his price for best \"beavers\" was a guinea and a half,\r\n\"silks,\" which first appeared in 1812, not being popular and \"felts\"\r\nunknown. Strangers have noted one peculiarity of the native Brums, and\r\nthat is their innate dislike to \"top hats,\" few of which are worn here\r\n(in comparison to population) except on Sunday, when respectable\r\nmechanics churchward-bound mount the chimney pot. In the revolutionary\r\ndays of 1848, &c., when local political feeling ran high in favour of\r\nPole and Hungarian, soft broad-brimmed felt hats, with flowing black\r\nfeathers were _en regle_, and most of the advanced leaders of the day\r\nthus adorned themselves. Now, the ladies monopolise the feathers and the\r\nglories thereof. According to the scale measure used by hatters, the\r\naverage size of hats worn is that called 6-7/8, representing one-half of\r\nthe length and breadth of a man's head, but it has been noted by\r\n\"S.D.R.\" that several local worthies have had much larger craniums,\r\nGeorge Dawson requiring a 7-1/2 sized hat, Mr. Charles Geach a 7-3/4,\r\nand Sir Josiah Mason a little over an 8. An old Soho man once told the\r\nwriter that Matthew Boulton's head-gear had to be specially made for\r\nhim, and, to judge from a bust of M.B., now in his possession, the hat\r\nrequired must have been extra size indeed.\r\n\r\n~Hearth Duty.~--In 1663, an Act was passed for the better ordering and\r\ncollecting the revenue derived from \"Hearth Money,\" and we gather a few\r\nfigures from a return then made, as showing the comparative number of\r\nthe larger mansions whose owners were liable to the tax. The return for\r\nBirmingham gives a total of 414 hearths and stoves, the account\r\nincluding as well those which are liable to pay as of those which are\r\nnot liable. Of this number 360 were charged with duty, the house of the\r\ncelebrated Humphrey Jennens being credited with 25. From Aston the\r\nreturn was but 47, but of these 40 were counted in the Hall and 7 in the\r\nParsonage, Edgbaston showed 37, of which 22 were in the Hall. Erdington\r\nwas booked for 27, and Sutton Coldfield for 67, of which 23 were in two\r\nhouses belonging to the Willoughby family. Coleshill would appear to\r\nhave been a rather warmer place of abode, as there are 125 hearths\r\ncharged for duty, 30 being in the house of Dame Mary Digby.\r\n\r\n~Heathfield.~--Prior to 1790 the whole of this neighbourhood was open\r\ncommon-land, the celebrated engineer and inventor, James Watt, after the\r\npassing of the Enclosure Act being the first to erect a residence\r\nthereon, in 1791. By 1794 he had acquired rather more than 40 acres,\r\nwhich, he then planted and laid out as a park. Heathfield House may be\r\ncalled the cradle of many scores of inventions, which, though novel when\r\nfirst introduced, are now but as household words in our everyday life.\r\nWatt's workshop was in the garret of the south-east corner of the\r\nbuilding, and may be said to be even now in exactly the same state as\r\nwhen his master-hand last touched the tools, but as the estate was\r\nlotted out for building purposes in May, 1874, and houses and streets\r\nhave been built and formed all round it, it is most likely that the\r\n\"House\" itself will soon lose all its historic interest, and the\r\ncontents of the workshop be distributed among the curiosity mongers, or\r\nhidden away on the shelves of some museum. To a local chronicler such a\r\nroom is as sacred as that in which Shakespeare was born, and in the\r\nwords of Mr. Sam Timmins, \"to open the door and look upon the strange\r\nrelics there is to stand in the very presence of the mighty dead.\r\nEverything in the room remains just as it was left by the fast failing\r\nhands of the octogenarian engineer. His well-worn, humble apron hangs\r\ndusty on the wall, the last work before him is fixed unfinished in the\r\nlathe, the elaborate machines over which his latest thoughts were spent\r\nare still and silent, as if waiting only for their master's hand again\r\nto waken them into life and work. Upon the shelves are crowds of books,\r\nwhose pages open no more to those clear, thoughtful eyes, and scattered\r\nin the drawers and boxes are the notes and memoranda, and pocket-books,\r\nand diaries never to be continued now. All these relics of the great\r\nengineer, the skilful mechanic, the student of science, relate to his\r\nintellectual and public life; but there is a sadder relic still. An old\r\nhair-trunk, carefully kept close by the old man's stool, contains the\r\nchildish sketches, the early copy-books and grammars, the dictionaries,\r\nthe school-books, and some of the toys of his dearly-beloved and\r\nbrilliant son Gregory Watt.\"\r\n\r\n~Heraldry.~--In the days of the mail-clad knights, who bore on their\r\nshields some quaint device, by which friend or foe could tell at sight\r\nwhom they slew or met in fight, doubtless the \"Kings-At-Arms,\" the\r\n\"Heralds,\" and the \"Pursuivants\" of the College of Arms founded by\r\nRichard III. were functionaries of great utility, but their duties\r\nnowadays are but few, and consist almost solely of tracing pedigrees for\r\nthat portion of the community whom our American cousins designate as\r\n\"shoddy,\" but who, having \"made their pile,\" would fain be thought of\r\naristocratic descent. In such a Radical town as Birmingham, the study of\r\n_or_ and _gules, azure_ and _vert_, or any of the other significant\r\nterms used in the antique science of heraldry, was not, of course, to be\r\nexpected, unless at the hands of the antiquary or the practical heraldic\r\nengraver, both scarce birds in our smoky town, but the least to be\r\nlooked for would be that the borough authorities should carefully see\r\nthat the borough coat of arms was rightly blazoned. It has been proved\r\nthat the town's-name has, at times, been spelt in over a gross of\r\ndifferent ways, and if any reader will take the trouble to look at the\r\npublic buildings, banks, and other places where the blue, red, and gold\r\nof the Birmingham Arms shines forth, he will soon be able to count three\r\nto four dozen different styles; every carver, painter, and printer\r\napparently pleasing himself how he does it. It has been said that when\r\nthe question of adopting a coat of arms was on the _tapis_, the grave\r\nand reverend seniors appointed to make inquiries thereanent, calmly took\r\ncopies of the shields of the De Berminghams and the De Edgbastous, and\r\nfitted the \"bend lozengy\" and the \"parti per pale\" together, under the\r\nimpression that the one noble family's cognisance was a gridiron, and\r\nthe other a currycomb, both of which articles they considered to be\r\nexceedingly appropriate for such a manufacturing town as Birmingham.\r\nWiser in their practicability than the gentlemen who designed the\r\npresent shield, they left the currycomb quarters in their proper _sable_\r\nand _argent_ (black and white), and the gridiron _or_ and _gules_ (a\r\ngolden grid on a red-hot fire.) For proper emblazonment, as by\r\nBirmingham law established, see the cover.\r\n\r\n~Heathmill Lane.~--In 1532 there was a \"water mill to grynde corne,\"\r\ncalled \"Heth mill,\" which in that year was let, with certain lands,\r\ncalled the \"Couyngry,\" by the Lord of the Manor, on a ninety-nine years'\r\nlease, at a rent of £6 13s. 4d. per year.\r\n\r\n~Here we are again~!--The London _Chronicle_ of August 14, 1788, quoting\r\nfrom a \"gentleman\" who had visited this town, says that \"the people are\r\nall diminutive in size, sickly in appearance, and spend their Sundays in\r\nlow debauchery,\" the manufacturers being noted for \"a great deal of\r\ntrick and low cunning as well as profligacy!\"\r\n\r\n~Highland Gathering.~--The Birmingham Celtic Society held their first\r\n\"gathering\" at Lower Grounds, August 2, 1879, when the ancient sports of\r\nputting stones, throwing hammers, etc., was combined with a little\r\nmodern bicycling, and steeple-chasing, to the music of the bagpipes.\r\n\r\n~Hill (Sir Rowland).~--See \"_Noteworthy Men_.\"\r\n\r\n~Hills.~--Like unto Rome this town may be said to be built on seven\r\nhills, for are there not Camp Hill and Constitution Hill, Summer Hill\r\nand Snow Hill, Ludgate Hill, Hockley Hill, and Holloway Hill (or head).\r\nTurner's Hill, near Lye Cross, Rawley Regis is over 100ft. higher than\r\nSedgley Beacon, which is 486ft. above sea level. The Lickey Hills are\r\nabout 800ft. above same level, but the highest hill within 50 miles of\r\nBirmingham is the Worcestershire Beacon, 1395ft. above sea level. The\r\nhighest mountain in England, Scawfell Pike, has an elevation of 3229ft.\r\n\r\n~Hailstorms.~--In 1760 a fierce hailstorm stripped the leaves and fruit\r\nfrom nearly every tree in the apple orchards in Worcestershire, the hail\r\nlying on the ground six to eight inches deep, many of the stones and\r\nlumps of ice being three and four inches round. In 1798, many windows at\r\nAston Hall were broken by the hail. A very heavy hailstorm did damage at\r\nthe Botanical gardens and other places, May 9, 1833. There have been a\r\nfew storms of later years, but none like unto these.\r\n\r\n~Hector.~--The formation of Corporation Street, and the many handsome\r\nbuildings erected and planned in its line, have improved off the face of\r\nthe earth, more than one classic spot, noted in our local history,\r\nforemost among which we must place the house of Mr. Hector, the old\r\nfriend and schoolfellow of Dr. Samuel Johnson. The great lexicographer\r\nspent many happy hours in the abode of his friend, and as at one time\r\nthere was a slight doubt on the matter, it is as well to place on record\r\nhere that the house in which Hector, the surgeon, resided, was No. 1, in\r\nthe Old Square, at the corner of the Minories, afterwards occupied by\r\nMr. William Scholefield, Messrs. Jevons and Mellor's handsome pile now\r\ncovering the spot. The old rate books prove this beyond a doubt. Hector\r\ndied there on the 2nd of September, 1794, after having practised as a\r\nsurgeon, in Birmingham, for the long period of sixty-two years. He was\r\nburied in a vault at Saint Philip's Church, Birmingham, where, in the\r\nmiddle aisle, in the front of the north gallery, an elegant inscription\r\nto his memory was placed. Hector never married, and Mrs. Careless, a\r\nclergyman's widow, Hector's own sister, and Johnson's \"first love,\"\r\nresided with him, and appears by the burial register of St. Philip's to\r\nhave died in October, 1788, and to have been buried there, probably in\r\nthe vault in which her brother was afterwards interred. In the month of\r\nNovember, 1784, just a month before his own decease, Johnson passed a\r\nfew days with his friend, Hector, at his residence in the Old Square,\r\nwho, in a letter to Boswell, thus speaks of the visit:--\"He\" (Johnson)\r\n\"was very solicitous with me, to recollect some of our most early\r\ntransactions, and to transmit them to him, for I perceived nothing gave\r\nhim greater pleasure than calling to mind those days of our innocence. I\r\ncomplied with his request, and he only received them a few days before\r\nhis death.\" Johnson arrived in London from Birmingham on the 16th of\r\nNovember, and on the following day wrote a most affectionate letter to\r\nMr. Hector, which concludes as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Let us think seriously on our duty. I send my kindest respects to\r\n  dear Mrs. Careless. Let me have the prayers of both. We have all lived\r\n  long, and must soon part. God have mercy upon us, for the sake of our\r\n  Lord Jesus Christ! Amen!\"\r\n\r\nThis was probably nearly the last letter Johnson wrote, for on the 13th\r\nof the following month, just twenty-seven days after his arrival in\r\nLondon from Birmingham, oppressed with disease, he was numbered with the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n~Hinkleys.~--Otherwise, and for very many years, known as \"The Inkleys,\"\r\nthe generally-accepted derivation of the name being taken from the fact\r\nthat one Hinks at one time was a tenant or occupier, under the Smalbroke\r\nfamily, of the fields or \"leys\" in that locality, the two first narrow\r\nroads across the said farm being respectively named the Upper and the\r\nNether Inkleys, afterwards changed to the Old and New Inkleys. Possibly,\r\nhowever, the source may be found in the family name of Hinckley, as seen\r\nin the register of Harborne. A third writer suggests that the character\r\nof its denizens being about as black as could be painted, the place was\r\nnaturally called Ink Leys. Be that as it may, from the earliest days of\r\ntheir existence, these places seem to have been the abode and habitation\r\nof the queerest of the queer people, the most aristocratic resident in\r\nour local records having been \"Beau Green,\" the dandy--[see\r\n\"_Eccentrics_\"]--who, for some years, occupied the chief building in the\r\nInkleys, nicknamed \"Rag Castle,\" otherwise Hinkley Hall. The beautiful\r\nand salubrious neighbourhood, known as \"Green's Village,\" an offshoot of\r\nthe Inkleys, was called so in honour of the \"Beau.\"\r\n\r\n~Hiring a Husband.~--In 1815, a Birmingham carpenter, after ill-treating\r\nhis wife, leased himself to another woman by a document which an\r\nunscrupulous attorney had the hardihood to draw up, and for which he\r\ncharged thirty-five shillings. This precious document bound the man and\r\nthe woman to live together permanently, and to support and succour each\r\nother to the utmost of their power. The poor wife was, of course, no\r\nconsenting party to this. She appealed to the law; the appeal brought\r\nthe \"lease\" before the eyes of the judiciary; the man was brought to his\r\nsenses (though probably remaining a bad husband), and the attorney\r\nreceived a severe rebuke.\r\n\r\n~Historical.~--A local Historical Society was inaugurated with an\r\naddress from Dr. Freeman, Nov. 18, 1880, and, doubtless, in a few years\r\nthe reports and proceedings will be of very great value and interest.\r\nThe fact that down to 1752 the historical year in England commenced on\r\nJanuary 1, while the civil, ecclesiastical, and legal year began on the\r\n25th of March, led to much confusion in dates, as the legislature, the\r\nchurch, and civilians referred every event which took place between\r\nJanuary 1 and March 25 to a different year from the historians.\r\nRemarkable examples of such confusion are afforded by two well-known\r\nevents in English history: Charles I. is said by most authorities to\r\nhave been beheaded January 30, 1648, while others, with equal\r\ncorrectness, say it was January 30, 1649; and so the revolution which\r\ndrove James II. from the throne is said by some to have taken place in\r\nFebruary, 1688, and by others in February, 1689. Now, these\r\ndiscrepancies arise from some using the civil and legal, and others the\r\nhistorical year, though both would have assigned any event occurring\r\n_after_ the 25th of March to the same years--viz., 1649 and 1689. To\r\navoid as far as possible mistakes from these two modes of reckoning, it\r\nwas usual, as often seen in old books or manuscripts, to add the\r\nhistorical to the legal date, when speaking of any day between January 1\r\nand March 25, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n              8(_i.e._ 1648, the civil and legal year.\r\n  Jan.30. 164- (\r\n              9(_i.e._ 1649 the historical year.\r\n\r\n\r\nor thus, January 30, 1648-9.\r\n\r\nThis practice, common as it was for many years, is, nevertheless, often\r\nmisunderstood, and even intelligent persons are sometimes perplexed by\r\ndates so written. The explanation, however, is very simple, for the\r\nlower or last figure always indicates the year according to our present\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\n~Hockley Abbey.~--Near to, and overlooking Boulton's Pool, in the year\r\n1799 there was a piece of waste land, which being let to Mr. Richard\r\nFord, one of the mechanical worthies of that period, was so dealt with\r\nas to make the spot an attraction for every visitor. Mr. Ford employed a\r\nnumber of hands, and some of them he observed were in the habit of\r\nspending a great part of their wages and time in dissipation. By way of\r\nexample to his workmen he laid aside some 12/-to 15/-a week for a\r\nconsiderable period, and when trade was occasionally slack with him, and\r\nhe had no other occupation for them, he sent his horse and cart to Aston\r\nFurnaces for loads of \"slag,\" gathering in this way by degrees a\r\nsufficient quantity of this strange building material for the erection\r\nof a convenient and comfortable residence. The walls being necessarily\r\nconstructed thicker than is usual when mere stone or brick is used, the\r\nfancy took him to make the place represent a ruined building, which he\r\nchristened \"Hockley Abbey,\" and to carry out his deceptive notion the\r\ndate 1473 was placed in front of the house, small pebbles set in cement\r\nbeing used to form the figures. In a very few years by careful training\r\nnearly the whole of the building was overgrown with ivy, and few but\r\nthose in the secret could have guessed at the history of this ruined\r\n\"abbey.\" For the house and some fifteen acres of land £100 rent was paid\r\nby Mr. Hubert Gallon, in 1816 and following years, exclusive of taxes,\r\nand by way of comfort to the heavily-burdened householders of to-day, we\r\nmay just add that, in addition to all those other duties loyal citizens\r\nwere then called upon to provide for the exigencies of the Government,\r\nthe parochial taxes on those premises from Michaelmas, 1816, to\r\nMichaelmas, 1817, included two church rates at 30s. each, three highway\r\nrates at 30s. each, and _thirty-six_ levies for the poor at 30s. each--a\r\ntotal of £61 10s. in the twelve months.\r\n\r\n~Hollow Tooth Yard.~--At one time commonly called the \"Devil's Hollow\r\nTooth Yard.\" This was the name given to the Court up the gateway in Bull\r\nStreet, nearest to Monmouth Street.\r\n\r\n~Holt Street,~ Heneage Street, Lister Street, &c., are named after the\r\nHolte family.\r\n\r\n~Home Hitting.~--The Rev. John Home, a Scotch divine, who visited\r\nBirmingham in 1802, said, \"it seemed here as if God had created man only\r\nfor making buttons.\"\r\n\r\n~Horse Fair.~--Formerly known as Brick-kiln Lane, received its present\r\nname from the fairs first held there in 1777.\r\n\r\n~Horses.~--To find out the number of these useful animals at present in\r\nBirmingham, is an impossible task; but, in 1873, the last year before\r\nits repeal, the amount paid for \"horse duty\" in the Borough was £3,294\r\n7s. 6d., being at the rate of 10s. 6d. on 6,275 animals.\r\n\r\n~Hospital Saturday.~--The fact of the contributions on Hospital Sundays\r\ncoming almost solely from the middle and more wealthy classes, led to\r\nthe suggestion that if the workers of the town could be organised they\r\nwould not be found wanting any more than their \"betters.\" The idea was\r\nquickly taken up, committees formed, and cheered by the munificent offer\r\nof £500 from Mr. P.H. Muntz towards the expenses, the first collection\r\nwas made on March 15th 1873, the result being a gross receipt of £4,705\r\n11s. 3d. Of this amount £490 8s. 10d. was collected from their customers\r\nby the licensed victuallers and beerhouse keepers; the gross totals of\r\neach year to the present time being--\r\n\r\n\r\n1873   . .   £4,705   11   3\r\n1874   . .    4,123   15   2\r\n1875   . .    3,803   11   8\r\n1876   . .    3,664   13   8\r\n1877   . .    3,200   17   0\r\n1878   . .    3,134    5   0\r\n1879   . .    3,421   10   2\r\n1880   . .    3,760    9   0\r\n1881   . .    3,968   18   7\r\n1882   . .    4,888   18   9\r\n1883   . .    5,489    9   0\r\n1884   . .    6,062   16   6\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter deducting for expenses, the yearly amounts are divided, _pro\r\nrata_, according to their expenditures among the several hospitals and\r\nsimilar charities, the proportions in 1883 being:--General Hospital.\r\n£1,843 4s. 1d.; Queen's Hospital, £931 8s. 3d.; General Dispensary, £561\r\n1s. 7d.; Children's Hospital, £498 0s. 4d.; Eye Hospital, £345 0s. 4d.;\r\nBirmingham and Midland Counties' Sanatorium, £211 0s. 4d., Women's\r\nHospital, £193 1s. 9d.; Homoepathic Hospital, £195 5s. 3d.; Orthopædic\r\nHospital, £138 13s. 6d.; Lying-in Charity, £67 6s. 5d.; Skin and Lock\r\nHospital, £44 14s. 8d.; Ear and Throat Infirmary, £26 12s. 8d.; Dental\r\nHospital, £9 5s. 3d.; and Birmingham Nursing District Society, £34 17s.\r\n7d. The total sum thus distributed in the twelve years is £48,574 18s.\r\n9d.\r\n\r\n~Hospital Sunday.~--There is nothing new under the sun! Birmingham has\r\nthe honour of being credited as the birth-place of \"Hospital Sundays,\"\r\nbut old newspapers tell us that as far back as 1751, when Bath was in\r\nits pride and glory, one Sunday in each year was set aside in that city\r\nfor the collection, at every place of worship, of funds for Bath\r\nHospital; and a correspondent writing to _Aris's Gazette_ recommended\r\nthe adoption of a similar plan in this town. The first suggestion for\r\nthe present local yearly Sunday collection for the hospitals appeared in\r\nan article, written by Mr. Thos. Barber Wright, in the _Midland Counties\r\nHerald_ in October, 1859. A collection of this kind took place on\r\nSunday, the 27th, of that month, and the first public meeting, when\r\narrangements were made for its annual continuance, was held in the Town\r\nHall, December 14th same year, under the presidency of Dr. Miller, who,\r\ntherefrom, has been generally accredited with being the originator of\r\nthe plan. The proceeds of the first year's collection were given to the\r\nGeneral Hospital, the second year to the Queen's, and the third year\r\ndivided among the other charitable institutions in the town of a like\r\ncharacter, and this order of rotation has been adhered to since.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the gross amounts collected since the\r\nestablishment of the movement:--\r\n\r\n\r\n1859  General Hospital..........£5,200    8   10\r\n1860  Queen's Hospital.......... 3,433    6    1\r\n1861  Amalgamated Charities..... 2,953   14    0\r\n1862  General Hospital.......... 8,340    4    7\r\n1863  Queen's Hospital.......... 3,293    5    0\r\n1864  Amalgamated Charities..... 3,178    5    0\r\n1865  General Hospital.......... 4,256   11   11\r\n1866  Queen's Hospital.......... 4,133    2   10\r\n1867  Amalgamated Charities..... 3,654    9    7\r\n1868  General Hospital.......... 4,253    9   11\r\n1869  Queen's Hospital.......... 4,469    1    8\r\n1870  Amalgamated Charities..... 4,111    6    7\r\n1871  General Hospital.......... 4,886    9    2\r\n1872  Queen's Hospital.......... 5,192    2    3\r\n1873  Amalgamated Charities..... 5,370    8    3\r\n1874  General Hospital.......... 5,474   17   11\r\n1875  Queen's Hospital.......... 5,800    8    8\r\n1876  Amalgamated Charities..... 5,265   10   10\r\n1877  General Hospital.......... 5,280   15    3\r\n1878  Queen's Hospital.......... 6,482   12   10\r\n1879  Amalgamated Charities..... 5,182    3   10\r\n1880  General Hospital.......... 4,886    1    8\r\n1881  Queen's Hospital.......... 4,585    1    3\r\n1882  Amalgamated Charities..... 4,800   12    6\r\n1883  General Hospital.......... 5,145    0    5\r\n1884  Queen's Hospital..........\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hospitals.~--_The General Hospital_ may be said to have been commenced\r\nin the year 1766, when the first steps were taken towards the erection\r\nof such an institution, but it was not formally opened for the reception\r\nof patients until 1779. The original outlay on the building was £7,140,\r\nbut it has received many additions since then, having been enlarged in\r\n1792, 1830, 1842, 1857 (in which year a new wing was erected, nominally\r\nout of the proceeds of a fête at Aston, which brought in £2,527 6s.\r\n2d.), 1865, and during the last few years especially. The last additions\r\nto the edifice consist of a separate \"home\" for the staff of nurses,\r\nutilising their former rooms for the admittance of more patients; also\r\ntwo large wards, for cases of personal injury from fire, as well as a\r\nmortuary, with dissecting and jury rooms, &c., the total cost of these\r\nimprovements being nearly £20,000. For a long period, this institution\r\nhas ranked as one of the first and noblest charities in the provinces,\r\nits doors being opened for the reception of cases from all parts of the\r\nsurrounding counties, as well as our own more immediate district. The\r\nlong list of names of surgeons and physicians, who have bestowed the\r\nbenefits of their learning and skill upon the unfortunate sufferers,\r\nbrought within its walls, includes many of the highest eminence in the\r\nprofession, locally and otherwise, foremost among whom must be placed\r\nthat of Dr. Ash, the first physician to the institution, and to whom\r\nmuch of the honour of its establishment belongs. The connection of the\r\nGeneral Hospital with the Triennial Musical Festivals, which, for a\r\nhundred years, have been held for its benefit, has, doubtless, gone far\r\ntowards the support of the Charity, very nearly £112,000 having been\r\nreceived from that source altogether, and the periodical collections on\r\nHospital Sundays and Saturdays, have still further aided thereto, but it\r\nis to the contributions of the public at large that the governors of the\r\ninstitution are principally indebted for their ways and means. For the\r\nfirst twenty-five years, the number of in-patients were largely in\r\nexcess of the out-door patients, there being, during that period, 16,588\r\nof the former under treatment, to 13,009 of the latter. Down to 1861,\r\nrather more than half-a-million cases of accident, illness, &c., had\r\nbeen attended to, and to show the yearly increasing demand made upon the\r\nfunds of the Hospital, it is only necessary to give a few later dates.\r\nIn 1860 the in-patients numbered 2,850, the out-patients 20,584, and the\r\nexpenditure was £4,191. In 1876, the total number of patients were\r\n24,082, and the expenditure £12,207. The next three years showed an\r\naverage of 28,007 patients, and a yearly expenditure of £13,900. During\r\nthe last four years, the benefits of the Charity have been bestowed upon\r\nan even more rapidly-increasing scale, the number of cases in 1880\r\nhaving been 30,785, in 1881 36,803, in 1882 44,623, and in 1883 41,551,\r\nthe annual outlay now required being considerably over £20,000 per year.\r\nWhen the centenary of the Hospital was celebrated in 1879, a suggestion\r\nwas made that an event so interesting in the history of the charity\r\nwould be most fittingly commemorated by the establishment or a Suburban\r\nHospital, where patients whose diseases are of a chronic character could\r\nbe treated with advantage to themselves, and with relief to the parent\r\ninstitution, which is always so pressed for room that many patients have\r\nto be sent out earlier than the medical officers like. The proposal was\r\nwarmly taken up, but no feasible way of carrying it out occurred until\r\nOctober, 1883, when the committee of the Hospital had the pleasure of\r\nreceiving a letter (dated Sept. 20), from Mr. John Jaffray, in which he\r\nstated that, having long felt the importance of having a Suburban\r\nHospital, and with a desire to do some amount of good for the community\r\nin which, for many years, he had received so much kindness, and to\r\nwhich, in great measure, he owed his prosperity, he had secured a\r\nfreehold site on which he proposed to erect a building, capable of\r\naccommodating fifty male and female patients, with the requisite offices\r\nfor the attendants and servants, and offered the same as a free gift to\r\nthe Governors, in trust for the public. This most welcome and munificent\r\noffer, it need hardly be said, was gratefully accepted, and a general\r\nappeal was made for funds to properly endow the \"Jaffray Suburban\r\nHospital,\" so that its maintenance and administration shall not detract\r\nfrom the extending usefulness of the parent institution. The site chosen\r\nby Mr. Jaffray is at Gravelly Hill, and it is estimated the new branch\r\nhospital, of which the first stone was laid June 4, 1884, will cost at\r\nleast £15,000 in erection. Towards the endowment fund there have been\r\nnine or ten donations of £1,000 each promised, and it is hoped a fully\r\nsufficient amount will be raised before the building is completed, for,\r\nin the words of Mr. Jaffray, we \"have great faith in the liberality of\r\nthe public towards an institution--the oldest and noblest and ablest of\r\nour medical charities--which for more than a century has done so much\r\nfor the relief of human suffering: and cannot help believing that there\r\nare in Birmingham many persons who, having benefited by the prosperity\r\nof the town, feel that they owe a duty to the community, and will gladly\r\nembrace this opportunity of discharging at least some part of their\r\nobligation.\" Patients are said to be admitted to the General Hospital by\r\ntickets from subscribers; but, in addition to accidents and cases of\r\nsudden illness, to which the doors are open at all hours, a large number\r\nof patients are admitted free on the recommendation of the medical\r\nofficers, the proportion of the cases thus admitted being as six to ten\r\nwith subscribers' tickets.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that a capital sum of at least £60,000 will be required\r\nto produce a sufficiently large income to maintain the Jaffray Suburban\r\nHospital, and donations have been, and are solicited for the raising of\r\nthat sum. Up to the time of going to press with the \"Dictionary,\" there\r\nhas been contributed nearly £24,000 of the amount, of which the largest\r\ndonations are:--\r\n\r\n\r\nG.F.

His Royal Highness the Prince Consort\r\nwas chosen as first president, and remained so until his death, the\r\noffice not being filled up again until 1875, when Lord Leigh was\r\nappointed. Many special efforts have been made to increase the funds of\r\nthis hospital, and with great success; thus, on Dec. 28, 1848, Jenny\r\nLind sang for it, the receipts amounting to £1,070. On July 27, 1857, a\r\nfête at Aston Park added £2,527 6s. 2d. (a like sum being given to the\r\nGeneral Hospital). In 1859, Mr. Sands Cox (to whom is due the merit of\r\noriginating the Queen's Hospital), commenced the arduous task of\r\ncollecting a million postage stamps, equivalent to £4,166 13s. 4d., to\r\nclear the then liabilities, to erect a chapel, and for purposes of\r\nextension. Her Majesty the Queen forwarded (Feb. 15, 1859) a cheque for\r\n£100 toward this fund. On January 16, 1869, the workmen of the town\r\ndecided to erect a new wing to the Hospital, and subscribed so freely\r\nthat Lord Leigh laid the foundation stone Dec. 4, 1871, and the\r\n\"Workmen's Extension\" was opened for patients Nov. 7, 1873. In 1880 a\r\nbazaar at the Town Hall brought in £3,687 17s., increased by donations\r\nand new subscriptions to £5,969. The system of admission by subscribers'\r\ntickets was done away with Nov. 1, 1875, a registration fee of 1s. being\r\nadopted instead. This fee, however, is not required in urgent cases or\r\naccident, nor when the patient is believed to be too poor to pay it. The\r\nordinary income for the year 1882 was £5,580, as compared with £4,834 in\r\nthe previous year, when the ordinary income was supplemented by the\r\nfurther sum of £4,356 from the Hospital Sunday collection, which falls\r\nto the Queen's Hospital once in three years. The chief items of ordinary\r\nincome were, subscriptions 1881, £2,780; 1882, £2,788; donations, 1881,\r\n£397; 1882, £237; Hospital Saturday, 1881, £711; 1882, £852; legacies,\r\n1881, £208; 1882, £870; dividends, 1881, £178; 1882, £199; registration\r\nfees, 1881, £538; 1882, £597. The expenditure for the year was £7,264,\r\nas compared with £6,997 in 1881. The number of in-patients in 1882 was\r\n1,669, as compared with 1,663 in 1881; the number of out-patients was\r\n16,538, as compared with 14,490 in the preceding year. The cost of each\r\nin-patient was £3 2s. 3-1/4d. Of the in-patients, 811 were admitted by\r\nregistration, the remainder being treated as accidents or urgent cases.\r\nOf the out-patients, 8,359 were admitted by registration, the remainder,\r\nnamely, 8,179, were admitted free.\r\n\r\n_The Children's Hospital_, founded in 1861, was first opened for the\r\nreception of patients Jan. 1, 1862, in the old mansion in Steelhouse\r\nLane, fronting the Upper Priory. At the commencement of 1870 the\r\nHospital was removed to Broad Street, to the building formerly known as\r\nthe Lying-in Hospital, an out-patient department, specially erected at a\r\ncost of about £3,250, being opened at the same time (January) in\r\nSteelhouse Lane, nearly opposite the mansion first used. The Broad\r\nStreet institution has accommodation for about fifty children in\r\naddition to a separate building containing thirty beds for the reception\r\nof fever cases, the erection of which cost £7,800; and there is a\r\nConvalescent Home at Alvechurch in connection with this Hospital to\r\nwhich children are sent direct from the wards of the Hospital\r\n(frequently after surgical operations) thus obtaining for them a more\r\nperfect convalescence than is possible when they are returned to their\r\nown homes, where in too many instances those important aids to recovery\r\n--pure air, cleanliness, and good food are sadly wanting. In addition to\r\nthe share of the Saturday and Sunday yearly collections, a special\r\neffort was made in 1880 to assist the Children's Hospital by a\r\nsimultaneous collection in the Sunday Schools of the town and\r\nneighbourhood, and, like the others, this has become a periodical\r\ninstitution. In 1880, the sum thus gathered from the juveniles for the\r\nbenefit of their little suffering brethren, amounted to £307 9s. 11d.;\r\nin 1881, it was £193 10s. 5d.; in 1882, £218 5s. 2d.; in 1883, £234 3s.\r\n1d. The number of patients during 1883 were: 743 in-patients 12,695\r\nout-patients, 75 home patients, and 475 casualties--total 13,998. The\r\nexpenditure of the year had been £4,399 0s. 3d., and the income but\r\n£4,087 14s. 2d.\r\n\r\n_Dental_.--This Hospital, 9, Broad Street, was instituted for gratuitous\r\nassistance to the poor in all cases of diseases of the teeth, including\r\nextracting, stopping, scaling, as well as the regulation of children's\r\nteeth. Any poor sufferer can have immediate attention without a\r\nrecommendatory note, but applicants requiring special operations must be\r\nprovided with a note of introduction from a governor. About 6,000\r\npersons yearly take their achers to the establishment.\r\n\r\n_Ear and Throat Infirmary_, founded in 1844, and formerly in Cherry\r\nStreet, has been removed to Newhall Street, where persons suffering from\r\ndiseases of the ear (deafness, &c.) and throat, are attended to daily at\r\nnoon. During the year ending June, 1883, 6,517 patients had been under\r\ntreatment, and 1,833 new cases had been admitted. Of the total, 1,389\r\nhad been cured, 348 relieved and 116 remained under treatment. The\r\nincrease of admissions over those of the previous year was 181, and the\r\naverage daily attendance of patients was 25. The number of patients\r\ncoming from places outside Birmingham was 577. The income of this\r\ninstitution is hardly up to the mark, considering its great usefulness,\r\nthe amount received from yearly subscribers being only £129 13s. 6d.,\r\nrepresenting 711 tickets, there being received for 875 supplementary\r\ntickets, £153 2s. 6d., and £15 11s. from the Hospital Saturday\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\n_The Eye Hospital_ was originated in 1823, and the first patients were\r\nreceived in April, 1824, at the hospital in Cannon Street. Some thirty\r\nyears afterwards the institution was removed to Steelhouse Lane, and in\r\n1862 to Temple Row, Dee's Royal Hotel being taken and remodelled for the\r\npurpose at a cost of about £8,300. In 1881 the number of patients\r\ntreated was 12,523; in 1882, 13,448 of whom 768 were in-patients, making\r\na total of over a quarter of a million since the commencement of the\r\ncharity. Admission by subscriber's ticket. Originally an hotel, the\r\nbuilding is dilapidated and very unsuitable to the requirements of the\r\nhospital, the space for attendants and patients being most inadequate.\r\nThis has been more and more evident for years past, and the erection of\r\na new building became an absolute necessity. The governors, therefore,\r\nhave taken a plot of land at the corner of Edmund Street and Church\r\nStreet, upon a lease from the Colmore family for 99 years, and hereon is\r\nbeing built a commodious and handsome new hospital, from carefully\r\narranged plans suitable to the peculiar necessities of an institution of\r\nthis nature. The estimated cost of the new building is put at £20,000,\r\nof which only about £8,000 has yet been subscribed (£5,000 of it being\r\nfrom a single donor). In such a town as Birmingham, and indeed in such a\r\ndistrict as surrounds us, an institution like the Birmingham and Midland\r\nEye Hospital is not only useful, but positively indispensable, and as\r\nthere are no restrictions as to distance or place of abode in the matter\r\nof patients, the appeal made for the necessary building funds should\r\nmeet with a quick and generous response, not only from a few\r\nlarge-hearted contributors, whose names are household words, but also\r\nfrom the many thousands who have knowledge directly or indirectly of the\r\nvast benefit this hospital has conferred upon those stricken by disease\r\nor accident--to that which is the most precious of all our senses. It is\r\nintended that the hospital should be a model to the whole kingdom of\r\nwhat such an institution ought to be; the latest and best of modern\r\nappliances, both sanitary and surgical, will be introduced. There will\r\nbe in and out departments, completely isolated one from the other,\r\nthough with a door of communication. From sixty to seventy beds will be\r\nprovided, special wards for a certain class of cases, adequate\r\nwaiting-rooms for out-patients, and the necessary rooms for the officers\r\nand medical attendants, all being on an ample scale.\r\n\r\n_Fever Hospital_.--There was a Fever Hospital opened in March, 1828, but\r\nwe have no note when it was closed, and possibly it may have been only a\r\ntemporary institution, such as become necessary now and then even in\r\nthese days of sanitary science. For some years past fever patients\r\nrequiring isolation have been treated in the Borough Hospital, but the\r\nHealth Committee have lately purchased a plot of land in Lodge Road of\r\nabout 4-1/2 acres, at a cost of £4,500, and have erected there on a\r\nwooden pavilion, divided into male and female wards, with all necessary\r\nbath rooms, nurses' rooms, &c., everything being done which can\r\ncontribute to the comfort and care of the inmates, while the greatest\r\nattention has been paid to the ventilation and other necessary items\r\ntending to their recovery. This pavilion is only a portion of the scheme\r\nwhich the committee propose to carry out, it being intended to build\r\nfour, if not five, other wards of brick. A temporary block of\r\nadministrative buildings has been erected at some distance from the\r\npavilion. There accommodation is provided for the matron, the resident\r\nmedical superintendent, the nurses when off duty, and the ordinary\r\nkitchen, scullery, and other offices are attached. When the permanent\r\noffices have been erected this building will be devoted to special fever\r\ncases, or, should there be a demand, private cases will be taken in. The\r\ncost of the whole scheme is estimated at £20,000, including the sum\r\ngiven for the land. It is most devoutly to be wished that this hospital,\r\nwhich is entirely free, will be generally used by families in case of a\r\nmember thereof be taken with any nature of infectious fever, the most\r\ncertain remedy against an epidemic of the kind, as well as the most\r\nfavourable chance for the patient being such an isolation as is here\r\nprovided. The hospital was opened September 11, 1883, and in cases of\r\nscarlet fever and other disorders of an infectious character, an\r\nimmediate application should be made to the health officer at the\r\nCouncil House.\r\n\r\n_Homoeopathic_.--A dispensary for the distribution of homoeopathic\r\nremedies was opened in this town in 1847, and though the new system met\r\nwith the usual opposition, it has become fairly popular, and its\r\npractitioners have found friends sufficient to induce them to erect a\r\nvery neat and convenient hospital, in Easy Row, at a cost of about\r\n£7,000, which was opened November 23rd, 1875, and may possibly soon be\r\nenlarged. A small payment, weekly, is looked for, if the patient can\r\nafford it, but a fair number are admitted free, and a much larger number\r\nvisited, the average number of patients being nearly 5,000 per annum.\r\nInformation given on enquiry.\r\n\r\n_Hospital for Women_.--This establishment in the Upper Priory was opened\r\nin October, 1871, for the treatment of diseases special to females. No\r\nnote or ticket of recommendation is required, applicants being attended\r\nto daily at two o'clock, except on Saturday and Sunday. If in a position\r\nto pay, a nominal sum of 2s. 6d. a month is expected as a contribution\r\nto the funds, which are not so flourishing as can be wished. The\r\nin-patients' department or home at Sparkhill has accommodation for 25\r\ninmates, and it is always full, while some thousands are treated at the\r\ntown establishment. The number of new cases in the out-patient\r\ndepartment in 1883 was 2,648, showing an annual increase of nearly 250 a\r\nyear. Of the 281 in-patients admitted last year, 205 had to undergo\r\nsurgical operations of various kinds, 124 being serious cases;\r\nnotwithstanding which the mortality showed a rate of only 5.6 per cent.\r\nAs a rule many weeks and months of care and attention are needed to\r\nrestore the general health of those who may have, while in the hospital,\r\nsuccessfully recovered from an operation, but there has not hitherto\r\nbeen the needful funds or any organisation for following up such cases\r\nafter they have left Sparkhill. Such a work could be carried on by a\r\nDistrict Nursing Society if there were funds to defray the extra\r\nexpense, and at their last annual meeting the Managing Committee decided\r\nto appeal to their friends for assistance towards forming an endowment\r\nfund for the treatment of patients at home during their convalescence,\r\nand also for aiding nurses during times of sickness. An anonymous\r\ndonation of £1,000 has been sent in, and two other donors have given\r\n£500 each, but the treasurer will be glad to receive additions thereto,\r\nand as early as possible, for sick women nor sick men can wait long. The\r\ntotal income for 1883 amounted to £1,305 16s. 4d., while the expenditure\r\nwas £1,685 4s. 11d., leaving a deficit much to be regretted.\r\n\r\n_Lying-in Hospital_.--Founded in 1842, and for many years was located in\r\nBroad Street, in the mansion since formed into the Children's Hospital.\r\nIn 1868 it was deemed advisable to close the establishment in favour of\r\nthe present plan of supplying midwives and nurses at the poor patients'\r\nhomes. In 1880 the number of patients attended was 1,020; in 1881, 973;\r\nin 1882, 894; in 1883, 870. In each of the two latter years there had\r\nbeen two deaths in mothers (1 in 441 cases) about the usual average of\r\ncharity. The number of children born alive during the last year was 839,\r\nof whom 419 were males, and 420 females. Four infants died; 37 were\r\nstill-born. There were 6 cases of twins. The assistance of the honorary\r\nsurgeons was called in 24 times, or once in 37 cases. The financial\r\nposition of the charity is less satisfactory than could be wished, there\r\nbeing again a deficiency. The subscriptions were £273, against £269 in\r\n1882 and £275 in 1881. There was a slight increase in the amount of\r\ndonations, but an entire absence of legacies, which, considering the\r\nvaluable assistance rendered by the charity to so many poor women, is\r\ngreatly to be deplored. The medical board have the power to grant to any\r\nwoman who passes the examination, the subjects of which are defined, a\r\ncertificate as a skilled midwife, competent to attend natural labours.\r\nOne midwife and four monthly nurses have already received certificates,\r\nand it is hoped that many more candidates will avail themselves of the\r\nopportunity thus readily afforded to them, and supply a want very\r\ngenerally felt among the poor of the town. Subscribers have the\r\nprivilege of bestowing the tickets, and the offices are at 71, Newhall\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n_Orthopædic and Spinal Hospital_--Was founded in June, 1817; the present\r\nestablishment in Newhall Street being entered upon in December, 1877.\r\nAll kinds of bodily deformity, hernia, club feet, spinal diseases,\r\nmalformations, and distortions of limbs, &c., are treated daily (at two\r\no'clock) free of charge, except where instruments or costly supports are\r\nneeded, when the patient must be provided with subscribers' tickets in\r\nproportion to the cost thereof. In 1881 and 1882, 4,116 cases received\r\nattention, 2,064 being new cases, and 678 from outside Birmingham. The\r\nvariety of diseases was very numerous, and instruments to the value of\r\n£420 were supplied to the patients.\r\n\r\n_Skin and Lock Hospital_, Newhall Street, was founded in 1880, and\r\nopened Jan. 10, 1881. Admission on payment of registration fee,\r\nattendance being given at two o'clock on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and\r\nThursday in each week.\r\n\r\n_Smallpox Hospital_.--A few years back, when there was a pretty general\r\nepidemic of smallpox, a temporary ward or addition was attached to the\r\nWorkhouse, but many persons whose intelligence led them to know the\r\nvalue of isolation in such cases, could not \"cotton\" to the idea of\r\ngoing themselves or sending their friends there. The buildings in Weston\r\nRoad, Winson Green, and now known as the Borough Hospital, have no\r\nconnection whatever with the Workhouse, and were opened for the\r\nreception of persons suffering from smallpox and scarlet fever in Nov.\r\n1874. The latter cases are now taken to the Hospital in Lodge Road, so\r\nthat present accommodation can be found in the Borough Hospital for\r\nnearly 250 patients at a time should it ever be necessary to do so.\r\nPersons knowing of any case of smallpox should at once give notice to\r\nthe officers of health at Council House.\r\n\r\n~Hotels.~--This French-derived name for inns, from what Hutton says on\r\nthe subject, would appear to have been only introduced in his day, and\r\neven then was confined to the large coaching-houses of the town, many of\r\nwhich have long since vanished. The first railway hotel was the Queen's,\r\nat the entrance of the old railway station, Duddeston Row, though\r\noriginally built and used for officers for the company's secretaries,\r\ndirectors' boardroom, &c. As part of the New Street Station, a far more\r\npretentious establishment was erected, and to this was given the title\r\nof the \"Queen's Hotel,\" the Duddeston Row building reverting to its\r\noriginal use. The Great Western Hotel was the next to be built, and the\r\nsuccess attending these large undertakings have led to the erection of\r\nthe handsome Midland Hotel, opposite New Street Station, and the still\r\ngrander \"Grand Hotel,\" in Colmore Row, opened Feb. 1, 1879. The removal\r\nof the County Court to Corporation Street, and the possible future\r\nerection of Assize Courts near at hand, have induced some speculators to\r\nembark in the erection of yet another extensive establishment, to be\r\ncalled the \"Inns of Court Hotel,\" and in due course of time we shall\r\ndoubtless have others of a similar character. At any of the above, a\r\nvisitor to the town (with money in his purse) can find first-class\r\naccommodation, and (in comparison with the London hotels of a like kind)\r\nat reasonably fair rates. After these come a second grade, more suitable\r\nfor commercial gentlemen, or families whose stay is longer, such as the\r\nnew Stork Hotel, the Albion, in Livery Street, Bullivant's, in Carr's\r\nLane, the Acorn, the Temperance at the Colonnade, and the Clarendon, in\r\nTemple Street, Dingley's, in Moor Street, Knapp's, in High Street,\r\nNock's, in Union Passage, the Plough and Harrow, in Hagley Road, the\r\nSwan, in New Street, the White Horse, in Congreve Street (opposite\r\nWalter Showell and Sons' head offices), the Woolpack, in Moor Street,\r\nand the other Woolpack, now called St. Martin's, at the back of the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nFor much entertaining information respecting the old taverns of\r\nBirmingham, the hotels of former days, we recommend the reader to\r\nprocure a copy of S.D.R.'s little book on the subject, which is full of\r\nanecdotes respecting the frequenters of the then houses, as well as many\r\nquaint notes of the past.\r\n\r\n_The Acorn_ in Temple Street.--The favourite resort of the \"men of the\r\ntime\" a few score years ago was at one period so little surrounded with\r\nhouses that anyone standing at its door could view a landscape\r\nstretching for miles, while listening to the song birds in the\r\nneighbouring gardens. It dates from about 1750, and numbers among its\r\nsuccessive landlords, Mr. John Roderick, the first auctioneer of that\r\nwell-known name, Mr. James Clements, and Mr. Coleman, all men of mark.\r\nThe last-named host, after making many improvements in the premises and\r\nrenewing the lease, disposed of the hotel to a Limited Liability Company\r\nfor £15,500. It is at present one of the best-frequented commercial\r\nhouses in the town.\r\n\r\n_The Hen and Chickens_.--In _Aris's Gazette_, of December 14, 1741,\r\nthere appeared an advertisement, that there was \"to be let, in the High\r\nStreet, Birmingham, a very good-accustomed Inn, the sign of the Hen and\r\nChickens, with stables, &c.\" Inasmuch as this advertisement also said\r\n\"there is a very good Bowling Green joining to it,\" it has been quoted\r\nby almost every writer of local history as an evidence of the popularity\r\nof those places of recreation, or as showing the open aspect of the then\r\nexisting town. This establishment is believed to have been on the site\r\nof Messrs. Manton's cabinet warehouse, the adjoining Scotland Passage\r\nleading to the stables, and possibly to \"the Bowling Green.\" In 1798,\r\nthe tenant, Mrs. Lloyd, removed to a new house in New Street, and took\r\nthe Hen and Chickens' title with her, the place becoming famous as a\r\nposting-house, and afterwards, under Mr. William Waddell, as one of the\r\nmost extensive coaching establishments in the Midlands. A mere list\r\nonly, of the Serene Highnesses, the Royalties, Nobility, and celebrated\r\ncharacters of all kinds, who have put up at this hotel, would fill\r\npages, and those anxious for such old-time gossip, must refer to\r\nS.D.R.'s book, as before-mentioned. At the close of 1878, the premises\r\nwere acquired by the \"Birmingham Aquarium Co., Limited,\" who proposed to\r\nerect a handsome concert-room, aquarium, restaurant, &c. The old\r\nbuilding has been considerably altered, and somewhat improved in\r\nappearance, but the aquarium and concert-room are, as yet, _non est_, an\r\nArcade being built instead.\r\n\r\n_The Midland_, New Street.--One of the modern style of hotels, having\r\nover a hundred good bedrooms, besides the necessary complement of public\r\nand private sitting and dining rooms, coffee, commercial, smoking and\r\nbilliard rooms, &c., erected for Mr. W.J. Clements in 1874; it was sold\r\nearly in 1876 to a Limited Company, whose capital was fixed at £40,000\r\nin £10 shares.\r\n\r\n_The Royal_, in Temple Row, was erected on the tontine principle in\r\n1772, but was not called more than \"The Hotel\" for a long time\r\nafterwards the word Royal being added in 1805, after His Royal Highness\r\nthe Duke of Gloucester slept there (May 4) on his way to Liverpool. In\r\n1830 the Duchess of Kent, and Princess Victoria (our present Queen)\r\nhonoured it by their presence. In June, 1804, the Assembly Room (for\r\nvery many years the most popular place for meetings of a social\r\ncharacter) was enlarged, the proprietors purchasing a small piece of\r\nadjoining land for the purpose at a cost of £250, being at the rate of\r\n£26,000 per acre, a noteworthy fact as showing the then rapidly\r\nincreasing value of property in the town. The portico in front of the\r\nhotel was put there in 1837, when the building had to be repaired, in\r\nconsequence of the kind attentions of the Birmingham Liberals at the\r\ntime of the general election then just passed. The whole of the front\r\nand main portion of the hotel is now used for the purposes of the Eye\r\nHospital, the Assembly Rooms, &c., being still public.--Portugal House,\r\nin New Street, on the present site of the Colonnade, prior to its being\r\ntaken for the Excise and Post Offices, was used for hotel purposes, and\r\nwas also called \"The Royal.\"\r\n\r\n_The Stork_.--The Directory of 1800 is the first which contains the name\r\nof the Stork Tavern, No. 3, The Square, the host then being Mr. John\r\nBingham, the title of Hotel not being assumed until 1808. For a few\r\nyears the one house was sufficient for the accommodation required, but\r\nas time progressed it became necessary to enlarge it, and this was\r\naccomplished by taking in the adjoining houses, until, at last, the\r\nhotel occupied one-fourth of The Square, from the corner of the Minories\r\nto the Lower Priory, in which were situated the stables, &c. It was in\r\none of the houses so annexed to the hotel (No. 1) that Dr. Hector, the\r\nfriend of Dr. Johnson, resided; and at the rear of another part of the\r\npremises in the Coach Yard, there was opened (in 1833) the \"The\r\nEquitable Labour Exchange.\" The whole of the hotel buildings were sold\r\nby auction, Sept. 26, 1881, and quickly razed to the ground, which was\r\nrequired for Corporation Street; but the Stork, like the fabulous\r\nPhoenix, has risen from its ashes, and in close proximity to the old\r\nsite, stands boldly forth as one of the magnificences of that-is-to-be\r\nmost-magnificent thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n_The Union_, in Cherry Street, was built in 1790, but much enlarged in\r\n1825. It was one of the principal coaching houses, but will be\r\nremembered mostly as furnishing the chief saleroom in the town for the\r\ndisposal of landed property. The site being required for Corporation\r\nStreet, the building was \"knocked down\" on the 21st April, 1879.\r\n\r\n_The Woolpack_, in Moor Street, saw many strange events, and had in its\r\nolden days undergone some few changes for there are not many sites in\r\nBirmingham that can compare with this in regard to its recorded history,\r\nbut at last it is being cleared to make way for a more modern structure.\r\nIt is believed there was a tavern called the Green Tree here close upon\r\n500 years ago, and even now there is still to be traced the course of an\r\nancient \"dyche\" running through the premises which was described as the\r\nboundary dividing certain properties in 1340, and forming part of that\r\nbelonging to the Guild of the Holy Cross. The house itself was the\r\nresidence of William Lench, whose bequests to the town are historical,\r\nbut when it was turned into a tavern is a little uncertain, as the\r\nearliest notice of it as such is dated 1709, when John Fusor was the\r\noccupier. It was the house of resort for many Birmingham worthies,\r\nespecially those connected with the law, even before the erection of the\r\nPublic Offices, and it is said that John Baskerville used to come here\r\nfor his tankard of ale and a gossip with his neighbours. In the time of\r\nthe Reform agitation it was frequented by the leaders of the Liberal\r\nparty, and has always been the favourite shelter of artists visiting the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n_The Woolpack_, in St. Martin's Lane.--Some eighty odd years ago the\r\ntavern standing at the corner of Jamaica Row and St. Martin's Lane was\r\nknown as the Black Boy Inn, from the figure of a young negro then placed\r\nover the door. Being purchased in 1817 by the occupier of a neighbouring\r\ntavern called the Woolpack, the two names were united, and for a time\r\nthe house was called the \"Black Boy and Woolpack,\" the first part being\r\ngradually allowed to fall into disuse. Prior to its demolition it was\r\n_the_ noted market hostelry for cattle dealers and others, the respected\r\nlandlord, Mr. John Gough, who held the premises from 1848 till his death\r\nin 1877, being himself a large wholesale dealer. When the Town Council\r\ndecided to enlarge and cover in the Smithfield Market, the old house and\r\nits adjuncts were purchased by them, and a new hotel of almost palatial\r\ncharacter has been erected in its place, the frontage extending nearly\r\nthe entire length of St. Martin's Lane, and the Black Boy and the\r\nWoolpack must in future be called St. Martin's Hotel.\r\n\r\n~Hothouses.~--Those at Frogmore, comprising a range of nearly 1,000 feet\r\nof metallic forcing houses, were erected in 1842-3, by Mr. Thomas Clark,\r\nof this town, his manager, Mr. John Jones, being described by the\r\ncelebrated Mr. London, as \"the best hot-house builder in Britain.\"\r\n\r\n~House and Window Tax.~--See \"_Taxes_.\"\r\n\r\n~Howard Street Institute.~--Founded in 1869. The first annual meeting,\r\nfor the distribution of prizes, was held in December, 1872. The many\r\nsources for acquiring knowledge now provided at such institutions as the\r\nMidland Institute, the Mason College, &c., have no doubt tended much to\r\nthe end, but, considering the amount of good derived by the pupils from\r\nthe many classes held in the Howard Street rooms, it is a pity the\r\nInstitute should be allowed to drop.\r\n\r\n~Humbug.~--The Prince of Humbugs, Phineas Barnum, at the Town Hall,\r\nFebruary 28, 1859, gave _his_ views of what constituted \"Humbug.\" As if\r\nthe Brums didn't know.\r\n\r\n~Humiliation Days.~--February 25, 1807, was kept here as a day of\r\nfasting and humiliation, as was also September 25, 1832.\r\n\r\n~Hundred.~--Birmingham is in the Hundred of Hemlingford.\r\n\r\n~Hungary.~--The first meeting in this town to express sympathy with the\r\nHungarians in their struggle with Austria, was held in the Corn\r\nExchange, May 23, 1849, and several speakers were in favour of sending\r\narmed help, but no volunteers came forward.\r\n\r\n~Hunter's Lane~ and Nursery Terrace take their names from the fact that\r\nMr. Hunter's nursery grounds and gardens were here situated. The \"Lane\"\r\nwas the old road to Wolverhampton, but has a much older history than\r\nthat, as it is believed to have been part of the Icknield Street.\r\n\r\n~Hurricanes.~--The late Mr. Thos. Plant, in describing the great storm,\r\nwhich visited England, on the night of Sunday, 6th January, 1839, and\r\nlasted all next day, said it was the most tremendous hurricane that had\r\noccurred here for fifty years. A large quantity of lead was stripped off\r\nthe roof of the Town Hall, the driving force of the gale being so\r\nstrong, that the lead was carried a distance of more than sixty yards\r\nbefore it fell into a warehouse, 'at the back of an ironmonger's shop in\r\nAnn Street.--See \"_Storms and Tempests_.\"\r\n\r\n~Hurst Street,~ from Hurst Hill, once a wooded mount (the same being the\r\nderivation of Ravenhurst Street), was originally but a passage way,\r\nleading under an arch at the side of the White Swan in Smallbrook Street\r\n(now Day's establishment). Up the passage was a knacker's yard, a shop\r\nfor the dyeing of felt hats, and a few cottages.\r\n\r\n~Icknield Street.~--Britain was formerly traversed by four great roads,\r\nusually called Roman roads, though there are some grounds for believing\r\nthat the Ancient Britons themselves were the pioneers in making these\r\ntrackways, their conquerors only improving the roads as was their wont,\r\nand erecting military stations along the line. These roads were\r\nseverally called \"Watling Stræte,\" which ran from the coast of Kent,\r\nthrough London, to the Welsh coast in county Cardigan; the \"Fosse,\"\r\nleading from Cornwall to Lincoln; \"Erminge Stræte,\" running from St.\r\nDavid's to Southampton; and \"Hikenilde Stræte,\" leading through the\r\ncentre of England, from St. David's to Tynemouth. Part of the latter\r\nroad, known as Icknield Street, is now our Monument Lane, and in 1865 a\r\nportion of ancient road was uncovered near Chad Valley House, which is\r\nbelieved to have been also part thereof. Proceeding in almost a direct\r\nline to the bottom of Hockley Hill, the Icknield Street ran across\r\nHandsworth Parish, by way of the present Hunter's Lane, but little\r\nfurther trace can be found now until it touches Sutton Coldfield Park,\r\nthrough which it passes for nearly a mile-and-a-half at an almost\r\nuniform width of about 60 feet. It is left for our future local\r\nantiquarians to institute a search along the track in the Park, but as\r\nin scores of other spots Roman and British remains have been found, it\r\nseems probable than an effort of the kind suggested would meet its\r\nreward, and perhaps lead to the discovery of some valuable relics of our\r\nlong-gone predecessors.\r\n\r\n~Illuminations.~--When the news of Admiral Rodney's victory was received\r\nhere, May 20, 1792, it was welcomed by a general illumination, as were\r\nalmost all the great victories during the long war. The Peace of Amiens\r\nin 1802 was also celebrated in this way, and the event has become\r\nhistorical from the fact that for the first time in the world's history\r\nthe inflammable gas obtained from coal (now one of the commonest\r\nnecessities of our advanced civilisation) was used for the purpose of a\r\npublic illumination at Soho Works. (See \"_Gas_.\") In 1813 the town went\r\ninto shining ecstacies four or five times, and ditto in the following\r\nyear, the chief events giving rise thereto being the entry of the Allies\r\ninto Paris, and the declaration of peace, the latter being celebrated\r\n(in addition to two nights' lighting up of the principal buildings,\r\n&c.), by an extra grand show of thousands of lamps at Soho, with the\r\naccompaniment of fireworks and fire-balloons, the roasting of sheep and\r\noxen, &c. Waterloo was the next occasion, but local chroniclers of the\r\nnews of the day gave but scant note thereof. From time to time there\r\nhave been illuminations for several more peaceable matters of rejoicing,\r\nbut the grandest display that Birmingham has ever witnessed was that to\r\ncelebrate the marriage of the Prince of Wales, March 10th, 1863, when\r\nSt. Philip's Church was illuminated on a scale so colossal as to exceed\r\nanything of the kind that had previously been attempted in the\r\nillumination by gas of public buildings upon their architectural lines.\r\nSituated in the centre, and upon the most elevated ground in Birmingham,\r\nSt. Philip's measures upwards of 170-ft. from the base to the summit of\r\nthe cross. The design for the illumination--furnished by Mr. Peter\r\nHollins--consisted of gas-tubing, running parallel to the principal\r\nlines of architecture from the base to the summit, pierced at distances\r\nof 3 in. or 5 in., and fitted with batswing burners. About 10,000 of\r\nthese burners were used in the illumination. The service-pipes employed\r\nvaried in diameter from three inches to three-quarters of an inch, and\r\nmeasured, in a straight line, about three-quarters of a mile, being\r\nunited by more than two thousand sockets. Separate mains conducted the\r\ngas to the western elevation, the tower, the dome, the cupola, and\r\ncross; the latter standing 8 ft. above the ordinary cross of the church,\r\nand being inclosed in a frame of ruby-coloured glass. These mains were\r\nconnected with a ten-inch main from a heavily-weighed gasometer at the\r\nWindsor Street works of the Birmingham Gas Company, which was reserved\r\nfor the sole use of the illumination. It took forty men three days to\r\nput up the scaffolding, but the whole work was finished and the\r\nscaffolding removed in a week. It was estimated that the consumption of\r\ngas during the period of illumination reached very nearly three-quarters\r\nof a million of cubic feet; and the entire expense of the illumination,\r\nincluding the gas-fittings, was somewhat over six hundred pounds. The\r\nillumination was seen for miles round in every direction. From the top\r\nof Barr Beacon, about eight miles distant, a singular effect was\r\nproduced by means of a fog cloud which hung over the town, and concealed\r\nthe dome and tower from view--a blood-red cross appearing to shine in\r\nthe heavens and rest upon Birmingham. As the traveller approached the\r\ntown on that side the opacity of the fog gradually diminished until,\r\nwhen about three miles away, the broad lines of light which spanned the\r\ndome appeared in sight, and, magnified by the thin vapour through which\r\nthey were refracted, gave the idea of some gigantic monster clawing the\r\nheavens with his fiery paws. All the avenues to the church and the\r\nsurrounding streets were crowded with masses of human heads, in the\r\nmidst of which stood a glittering fairy palace. The effect was\r\nheightened by coloured fires, which, under the superintendence of Mr.\r\nC.L. Hanmer, were introduced at intervals in burning censers, wreathing\r\ntheir clouds of incense among the urns upon the parapet in the gallery\r\nof the tower, and shedding upon the windows of the church the rich tints\r\nof a peaceful southern sky at sunset. The several gateways were wreathed\r\nin evergreens, amongst which nestled festoons of variegated lamps. So\r\ngreat was the sensation produced throughout the town and surrounding\r\ndistricts, and such the disappointment of those who had not seen it,\r\nthat the committee, at a great expense, consented to reillumine for one\r\nnight more, which was done on the 13th. The last general illumination\r\nwas on the occasion of the visit of Prince and Princess of Wales, Nov.\r\n3, 1874.\r\n\r\n~Improvement Schemes.~--See \"_Town Improvements_.\"\r\n\r\n~Income Tax.~--This impost was first levied in 1798, when those who had\r\nfour children were allowed an abatement of 10 per cent.; eight children,\r\n15 per cent.; ten or more 20 per cent. At the close of the Peninsular\r\ncampaign this tax was done away with, it being looked upon, even in\r\nthose heavily betaxed times, as about the most oppressive duty ever\r\nimposed by an arbitrary Government on loyal and willing citizens. When\r\nthe tax was revived, in 1842, there was a considerable outcry, though if\r\nfairly levied it would seem to be about the most just and equitable mode\r\nof raising revenue that can be devised, notwithstanding its somewhat\r\ninquisitorial accompaniments. The Act was only for three years but it\r\nwas triennially renewed until 1851, since when it has become \"a yearly\r\ntenant,\" though at varying rates, the tax being as high as 1s. 4d. in\r\nthe pound in 1855, and only 2d. in 1874. A Parliamentary return issued\r\nin 1866 gave the assessment of Birmingham to the Income Tax at\r\n£1,394,161; in 1874 it was estimated at £1,792,700. The present\r\nassessment is considerably over the two millions, but the peculiar\r\nreticence generally connected with all Governmental offices prevents us\r\ngiving the exact figures.\r\n\r\n~Indian Famine.~--The total amount subscribed here towards the fund for\r\nthe relief of sufferers by famine in India in 1877 was £7,922 13s. 2d.\r\n\r\n~India-rubber,~ in 1770, was sold at 3s. per cubic half-inch, and was\r\nonly used to remove pencil marks from paper. Its present uses are\r\nmanifold, and varied in the extreme, from the toy balloon of the infant\r\nto railway buffers and unsinkable lifeboats.\r\n\r\n~Infirmaries.~--See \"_Hospitals_,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Inge.~--The family name of one of the large property owners of this\r\ntown, after whom Inge Street is so called. The last representative of\r\nthe family lived to the ripe old age of 81, dying in August, 1881.\r\nThough very little known in the town from whence a large portion of his\r\nincome was drawn, the Rev. George Inge, rector of Thorpe\r\n(Staffordshire), was in his way a man of mark, a mighty Nimrod, who\r\nfollowed the hounds from the early age of five, when he was carried on a\r\npony in front of a groom, until a few weeks prior to his death, having\r\nhunted with the Atherstone pack duriug the management of sixteen\r\nsuccessive masters thereof.\r\n\r\n~Insane Asylums.~--See \"_Lunacy_.\"\r\n\r\n~Insurance.~--In 1782 a duty of 1s. 6d. per cent, was levied on all fire\r\ninsurances, which was raised to 2s. in 1797, to 2s. 6d. in 1804. and to\r\n3s. in 1815, remaining at that until 1865, when it was lowered to 1s.\r\n6d., being removed altogether in 1869. Farming stock was exempted in\r\n1833, and workmen's tools in 1860.\r\n\r\n~Insurance Companies.~--Their name is legion, their agents are a\r\nmultitude, and a list of their officers would fill a book. You can\r\ninsure your own life, or your wife's, or your children's or anybody\r\nelse's, in whose existence you may have a beneficial interest, and there\r\nare a hundred officers ready to receive the premiums. If you are\r\njourneying, the Railway Passengers' Accident Co. will be glad to\r\nguarantee your family a solatium in case you and your train come to\r\ngrief, and though it is not more than one in half-a-million that meets\r\nwith an accident on the line, the penny for a ticket, when at the\r\nbooking office, will be well expended. Do you employ clerks, there are\r\nseveral Guarantee Societies who will secure you against loss by\r\ndefalcation. Shopkeepers and others will do well to insure their glass\r\nagainst breakage, and all and everyone should pay into a \"General\r\nAccident\" Association, for broken limbs, like broken glass, cannot be\r\nforeseen or prevented. It is not likely that any of [**] will be \"drawn\"\r\nfor a militiaman in these piping times of peace, but that the system of\r\ninsurance was applied here in the last century against the chances of\r\nbeing drawn in the ballot, is evidenced by the following\r\ncarefully-preserved and curious receipt:--\r\n\r\n  \"Received of Matthew Boulton, tagmaker, Snow Hill, three shillings and\r\n  sixpence, for which sum I solemnly engage, if he should be chosen by\r\n  lot to serve in the militia for this parish, at the first meeting for\r\n  that purpose, to procure a substitute that shall be approved of.\r\n\r\n  \"HENRY BROOKES, Sergt.\r\n\r\n  \"Birmingham, Jan. 11, 1762.\"\r\n\r\nThe local manufacture of Insurance Societies has not been on a large\r\nscale, almost the only ones being the \"Birmingham Workman's Mutual,\" the\r\n\"British Workman,\" and the \"Wesleyan and General.\" The late Act of\r\nParliament, by which in certain cases, employers are pecuniarily liable\r\nfor accidents to their workpeople, has brought into existence several\r\nnew Associations, prominent among which is the comprehensive \"Employers'\r\nLiability and Workpeople's Provident and Accident Insurance Society,\r\nLimited,\" whose offices are at 33, Newhall Street.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n~Interesting Odds and Ends.~\r\n\r\nA fair was held here on Good Friday, 1793.\r\n\r\nA fight of lion with dogs took place at Warwick, September 4, 1824.\r\n\r\nThe Orsim bombs used in Paris, January 15, 1858, were made here.\r\n\r\nIn 1771 meetings of the inhabitants, were called by the tolling of a\r\nbell.\r\n\r\nA large assembly of Radicals visited Christ Church, November 21, 1819,\r\nbut _not_ for prayer.\r\n\r\nA \"flying railway\" (the Centrifugal) was exhibited at the Circus in\r\nBradford Street, October 31, 1842.\r\n\r\nThe doors of Moor Street prison were thrown open, September 3, 1842,\r\nthere, not being then one person in confinement.\r\n\r\nMarch 2, 1877, a bull got loose in New Street Station, and ran through\r\nthe tunnel to Banbury Street, where he leaped over the parapet and was\r\nmade into beef.\r\n\r\nWilliam Godfrey, who died in Ruston-street, October 27, 1863, was a\r\nnative of this town, who, enlisting at eighteen, was sent out to China,\r\nwhere he accumulated a fortune of more than £1,000,000. So said the\r\n_Birmingham Journal_, November 7, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe De Berminghams had no blankets before the fourteenth century, when\r\nthey were brought from Bristol. None but the very rich wore stockings\r\nprior to the year 1589, and many of them had their legs covered with\r\nbands of cloth.\r\n\r\nA petition was presented to the Prince of Wales (June 26, 1791) asking\r\nhis patronage and support for the starving buckle-makers of Birmingham.\r\nHe ordered his suite to wear buckles on their shoes, but the laces soon\r\nwhipped them out of market.\r\n\r\nOne Friday evening in July, 1750, a woman who had laid informations\r\nagainst 150 persons she had caught retailing spirituous liquors without\r\nlicenses, was seized by a mob, who doused, ducked and daubed her, and\r\nthen shoved her in the Dungeon.\r\n\r\nAt a parish meeting, May 17, 1726, it was decided to put up an organ in\r\nSt. Martin's at a cost of £300 \"and upwards.\" At a general meeting of\r\nthe inhabitants, April 3, 1727, it was ordered that, a bell be cast for\r\nSt. Philip's, \"to be done with all expedition.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1789 it was proposed that the inmates of the workhouse should be\r\nemployed at making worsted and thread. Our fathers often tried their\r\ninventive faculties in the way of finding work for the inmates. A few\r\nyears later it was proposed (August 26) to lighten the rates by erecting\r\na steam mill for grinding corn.\r\n\r\nOn the retirement of Mr. William Lucy, in 1850, from the Mayoralty, the\r\nusual vote of thanks was passed, but with _one_ dissentient. Mr. Henry\r\nHawkes was chosen coroner July 6, 1875, by forty votes to _one_. The\r\ngreat improvement scheme was adopted by the Town Council (November 10,\r\n1875), with but _one_ dissentient.\r\n\r\nA certificate, dated March 23, 1683, and signed by the minister and\r\nchurch-wardens, was granted to Elizabeth, daughter of John and Ann\r\nDickens, \"in order to obtain his majesty's touch for the Evil.\" The\r\n\"royal touch\" was administered to 200 persons from this neighbourhood,\r\nMarch 17, 1714; Samuel Johnson (the Dr.) being one of those whose\r\nailments, it was believed, could be thus easily removed. Professor\r\nHolloway did not live in those days.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Holte (the first baronet) is traditionally reported to have\r\nslain his cook. He brought an action for libel against one William\r\nAscrick, for saying \"that he did strike his cook with a cleaver, so that\r\none moiety of the head fell on one shoulder, and the other on the other\r\nshoulder.\" The defendant was ordered to pay £30 damages, but appealed,\r\nand successfully; the worthy lawyers of that day deciding that though\r\nSir Thomas might have clove the cook's head, the defendant did not say\r\nhe had _killed_ the man, and hence had not libelled the baronet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n~Interpreters.~--In commercial circles it sometimes happens that the\r\nforeign corresponding clerk may be out of the way when an important\r\nbusiness letter arrives, and we, therefore, give the addresses of a few\r\ngentlemen linguists, viz.:--Mr. H.R. Forrest, 46, Peel Buildings, Lower\r\nTemple Street; Mr. L. Hewson, 30, Paradise Street; Mr. F. Julien, 189,\r\nMonument Road; Mr. Wm. Krisch, 3, Newhall Street; Mr. L. Notelle, 42,\r\nGeorge Road, Edgbaston; and Mr. A. Vincent, 49, Islington Row.\r\n\r\n~Invasion.~--They said the French were coming in February, 1758, so the\r\npatriotic Brums put their hands into their pockets and contributed to a\r\nfund \"to repel invasion.\"\r\n\r\n~Inventors and Inventions.~--Birmingham, for a hundred years, led the\r\nvan in inventions of all kinds, and though to many persons patent\r\nspecifications may be the driest of all dry reading, there is an\r\ninfinitude of interesting matter to be found in those documents. Much of\r\nthe trade history of the town is closely connected with the inventions\r\nof the patentees of last century, including such men as Lewis Paul, who\r\nfirst introduced spinning by rollers, and a machine for the carding of\r\nwool and cotton; Baskerville, the japanner; Wyatt, partner with Paul;\r\nBoulton, of Soho, and his coadjutors, Watt, Murdoch, Small, Keir,\r\nAlston, and others. Nothing has been too ponderous and naught too\r\ntrivial for the exercise of the inventive faculties of our skilled\r\nworkmen. All the world knows that hundreds of patents have been taken\r\nout for improvements, and discoveries in connection with steam\r\nmachinery, but few would credit that quite an equal number relate to\r\nsuch trifling articles as buckles and buttons, pins and pens, hooks and\r\neyes, &c.; and fortunes have been made even more readily by the\r\nmanufacture of the small items than the larger ones. The history of\r\nBirmingham inventors has yet to be written; a few notes of some of their\r\ndoings will be found under \"_Patents_\" and \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Iron.~--In 1354 it was forbidden to export iron from England. In 1567\r\nit was brought here from Sweden and Russia. A patent for smelting iron\r\nwith pit coal was granted in 1620 to Dud Dudley, who also patented the\r\ntinning of iron in 1661. The total make of iron in England in 1740 was\r\nbut 17,000 tons, from 59 furnaces, only two of which were in\r\nStaffordshire, turning out about 1,000 tons per year. In 1788 there were\r\nnine blast furnaces in the same county; in 1796, fourteen; in 1806,\r\nforty-two; in 1827, ninety-five, with an output of 216,000 tons, the\r\nkingdom's make being 690,000 tons from 284 furnaces. This quantity in\r\n1842 was turned out of the 130 Staffordshire furnaces alone, though the\r\nhot-air blast was not used prior to 1835. Some figures have lately been\r\npublished showing that the present product of iron in the world is close\r\nupon 19-1/2 million tons per year, and as iron and its working-up has a\r\nlittle to do with the prosperity of Birmingham, we preserve them.\r\nStatistics for the more important countries are obtainable as late as\r\n1881. For the others it is assumed that the yield has not fallen off\r\nsince the latest figures reported. Under \"other countries,\" in the table\r\nbelow, are included Canada, Switzerland, and Mexico, each producing\r\nabout 7,500 tons a year, and Norway, with 4,000 tons a year:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Year.

The chief\r\nconsumer is the United States, 29 per cent.; next Great Britain, 23 '4\r\nper cent.; these two using more than half of all. Cast iron wares do not\r\nappear to have been made here in any quantity before 1755; malleable\r\niron castings being introduced about 1811. The first iron canal boat\r\nmade its appearance here July 24, 1787. Iron pots were first tinned in\r\n1779 by Jonathan Taylor's patented process, but we have no date when\r\nvessels of iron were first enamelled, though a French method of coating\r\nthem with glass was introduced in 1850 by Messrs. T.G. Griffiths and Co.\r\nIn 1809, Mr. Benjamin Cook, a well-known local inventor, proposed to use\r\niron for building purposes, more particularly in the shape of joists,\r\nrafters, and beams, so as to make fire-proof rooms, walls, and flooring,\r\nas well as iron staircases. This suggestion was a long time before it\r\nwas adopted, for in many things Cook was far in advance of his age.\r\nCorrugated iron for roofing, &c., came into use in 1832, but it was not\r\ntill the period of the Australian gold fever--1852-4--that there was any\r\ngreat call for iron houses. The first iron church (made at Smethwick) as\r\nwell as iron barracks for the mounted police, were sent out there, the\r\nprice at Melbourne for iron houses being from £70 each.--See \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Iron Bedsteads~ are said to have been invented by Dr. Church. Metallic\r\nbedsteads of many different kinds have been made since then, from the\r\nsimple iron stretcher to the elaborately guilded couches made for\r\nprinces and potentates, but the latest novelty in this line is a\r\nbedstead of solid silver, lately ordered for one of the Indian Rajahs.\r\n\r\n~Iron Rods.~--Among the immense number of semi-religious tracts\r\npublished during the Civil War, one appeared (in 1642) entitled \"An Iron\r\nRod for the Naylours and Tradesmen near Birmingham,\" by a self-styled\r\nprophet, who exhorted his neighbours to amend their lives and give\r\nbetter prices \"twopence in the shilling at the least to poor workmen.\"\r\nWe fancy the poor nailers of the present time would also be glad of an\r\nextra twopence.\r\n\r\n~Jacks.~--Roasting Jacks of some kind or other were doubtless used by\r\nour great-great-grandmothers, but their kitchen grates were not supplied\r\nwith \"bottle-jacks\" till their fellow-townsman, Mr. Fellowes, of Great\r\nHampton Street, made them in 1796.\r\n\r\n~Jennens.~--It is almost certain that the \"Great Jennens (or Jennings)\r\nCase,\" has taken up more time in our law courts than any other cause\r\nbrought before the judges. Charles Dickens is supposed to have had some\r\nlittle knowledge of it, and to have modelled his \"Jarndyce _v_.\r\nJarndyce\" in \"Bleak House\" therefrom. It has a local interest, inasmuch\r\nas several members of the family lived, prospered, and died here, and,\r\nin addition, a fair proportion of the property so long disputed, is here\r\nsituated. The first of the name we hear of as residing in Birmingham was\r\nWilliam Jennens, who died in 1602. His son John became a well-to-do\r\nironmonger, dying in 1653. One of John's sons, Humphrey, also waxed\r\nrich, and became possessed of considerable estate, having at one time,\r\nit is said, no less a personage than Lord Conway as \"game-keeper\" over a\r\nportion of his Warwickshire property. Probably the meaning was that his\r\nlordship rented the shooting. Ultimately, although every branch of the\r\nfamily were tolerably prolific, the bulk of the garnered wealth was\r\nconcentrated in the hands of William Jennings, bachelor, who died at\r\nActon Place in 1798, at the age of 98, though some have said he was 103.\r\nHis landed property was calculated to be worth £650,000; in Stock and\r\nShares he held £270,000; at his bankers, in cash and dividends due,\r\nthere were £247,000; while at his several houses, after his death, they\r\nfound close upon £20,000 in bank notes, and more than that in gold.\r\nDying intestate, his property was administered to by Lady Andover, and\r\nWilliam Lygon, Esq., who claimed to be next of kin descended from\r\nHumphrey Jennings, of this town. Greatest part of the property was\r\nclaimed by these branches, and several noble families were enriched who,\r\nit is said, were never entitled to anything. The Curzon family came in\r\nfor a share, and hence the connection of Earl Howe and others with this\r\ntown. The collaterals and their descendants have, for generations, been\r\nfighting for shares, alleging all kinds of fraud and malfeasance on the\r\npart of the present holders and their predecessors, but the claimants\r\nhave increased and multiplied to such an extent, that if it were\r\npossible for them to recover the whole of the twelve million pounds they\r\nsay the property is now worth, it would, when divided, give but small\r\nfortunes to any of them. A meeting of the little army of claimants was\r\nheld at the Temperance Hall, March 2, 1875, and there have been several\r\nattempts, notwithstanding the many previous adverse decisions, to\r\nre-open the battle for the pelf, no less than a quarter of a million, it\r\nis believed, having already been uselessly spent in that way.\r\n\r\n~Jennen's Row~ is named after the above family.\r\n\r\n~Jewellery.~--See \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Jews.~--The descendants of Israel were allowed to reside in this\r\ncountry in 1079, but if we are to believe history their lot could not\r\nhave been a very pleasant one, the poorer classes of our countrymen\r\nlooking upon them with aversion, while the knights and squires of high\r\ndegree, though willing enough to use them when requiring loans for their\r\nfierce forays, were equally ready to plunder and oppress on the\r\nslightest chance. Still England must have even then been a kind of\r\nsheltering haven, for in 1287, when a sudden anti-Semitic panic occurred\r\nto drive the Jews out of the kingdom, it was estimated that 15,660 had\r\nto cross the silver streak. Nominally, they were not allowed to return\r\nuntil Cromwell's time, 364 years after. It was in 1723 Jews were\r\npermitted to hold lands in this country, and thirty years after an Act\r\nwas passed to naturalise them, but it was repealed in the following\r\nyear. Now the Jews are entitled to every right and privilege that a\r\nChristian possesses. It is not possible to say when the Jewish community\r\nof this town originated, but it must have been considerably more than a\r\nhundred and fifty years ago, as when Hutton wrote in 1781, there was a\r\nsynagogue in the Froggery, \"a very questionable part of the town,\" and\r\nan infamous locality. He quaintly says:--\"We have also among us a\r\nremnant of Israel, a people who, when masters of their own country, were\r\nscarcely ever known to travel, and who are now seldom employed in\r\nanything else. But though they are ever moving they are ever at home;\r\nwho once lived the favourites of heaven, and fed upon the cream of the\r\nearth, but now are little regarded by either; whose society is entirely\r\nconfined to themselves, except in the commercial line. In the synagogue,\r\nsituated in the Froggery, they still preserve the faint resemblance of\r\nthe ancient worship, their whole apparatus being no more than the\r\ndrooping ensigns of poverty. The place is rather small, but tolerably\r\nfilled; where there appears less decorum than in the Christian churches.\r\nThe proverbial expression, 'as rich as a Jew,' is not altogether\r\nverified in Birmingham; but, perhaps, time is transferring it to the\r\nQuakers. It is rather singular that the honesty of a Jew is seldom\r\npleaded but by the Jew himself.\" No modern historian would think of\r\nusing such language now-a-days, respecting the Jews who now abide with\r\nus, whose charitable contributions to our public institutions, &c., may\r\nbear comparison with those of their Christian brethren. An instance of\r\nthis was given so far back as December 5th, 1805, the day of general\r\nthanksgiving for the glorious victory of Trafalgar. On that day\r\ncollections were made in all places of worship in aid of the patriotic\r\nfund for the relief of those wounded, and of the relatives of those\r\nkilled in the war. It is worthy of remark that the parish church, St.\r\nMartin's, then raised the sum of £37 7s., and the \"Jews' Synagogue\" £3\r\n3s. At the yearly collections in aid of the medical charities, now\r\nannually held on Hospital Sunday, St. Martin's gives between three and\r\nfour hundred pounds; the Jewish congregation contributes about one\r\nhundred and fifty. If, then, the church has thus increased ten-fold in\r\nwealth and benevolence in the last seventy years, the synagogue has\r\nincreased fifty-fold.\r\n\r\n~Jews' Board of Guardians.~ A committee of resident Jews was appointed\r\nin 1869, to look after and relieve poor and destitute families among the\r\nIsraelites; and though they pay their due quota to the poor rates of\r\ntheir parish, it is much to the credit of the Jewish community that no\r\npoor member is, permitted to go to the Workhouse or want for food and\r\nclothing. The yearly amount expended in relief by this Hebrew Board of\r\nGuardians is more than £500, mostly given in cash in comparatively large\r\nsums, so as to enable the recipients to become self-supporting, rather\r\nthan continue them as paupers receiving a small weekly dole. There is an\r\nincrease in the number of poor latterly, owing to the depression of\r\ntrade and to the influx of poor families from Poland during the last few\r\nyears. Another cause of poverty among the Jews is the paucity of\r\nartisans among them, very few of them even at the present time choosing\r\nto follow any of the staple trades outside those connected with clothing\r\nand jewellery.\r\n\r\n~Jewish Persecutions in Russia.~--On Feb. 6, 1882, a town's meeting was\r\ncalled with reference to the gross persecution of the Jews in Russia,\r\nand the collection of a fund towards assisting the sufferers was set\r\nafoot, £1,800 being promised at the meeting.\r\n\r\n~John a' Dean's Hole.~--A little brook which took the water from the\r\nmoat round the old Manor House (site of Smithfield) was thus called,\r\nfrom a man named John Dean being drowned there about Henry VIII.'s time.\r\nThis brook emptied into the river Rea, near the bottom of Floodgate\r\nStreet, where a hundred and odd years back, there were two poolholes,\r\nwith a very narrow causeway between them, which was especially dangerous\r\nat flood times to chance wayfarers who chose the path as a near cut to\r\ntheir dwellings, several cases of drowning being on record as occurring\r\nat this spot.--See \"_Manor House_.\"\r\n\r\n~Johnson, Dr. Samuel.~--Dr. Johnson's connection with Birmingham has\r\nalways been a pleasant matter of interest to the local _literati_, but\r\nto the general public we fear it matters naught. His visit to his good\r\nfriend Dr. Hector in 1733 is historically famous; his translations and\r\nwritings while here have been often noted; his marriage with the widow\r\nPorter duly chronicled; but it is due to the researches of the learned\r\nDr. Langford that attention has been lately drawn to the interesting\r\nfact that Johnson, who was born in 1709, actually came to Birmingham in\r\nhis tenth year, on a visit to his uncle Harrison, who in after years, in\r\nhis usual plain-speaking style, Johnson described as \"a very mean and\r\nvulgar man, drunk every night, but drunk with little drink, very\r\npeevish, very proud, very ostentatious, but, luckily, not rich.\" That\r\nour local governors have a due appreciation of the genius of the famed\r\nlexicographer is shown by the fact of a passage-way from Bull Street to\r\nthe Upper Priory being named \"Dr. Samuel Johnson's Passage!\"\r\n\r\n~Jubilees.~--Strange as it may appear to the men of the present day,\r\nthere has never been a National holiday yet kept equal to that known as\r\nthe Jubilee Day of George the Third. Why it should have been so seems a\r\ngreat puzzle now. The celebration began in this town at midnight of the\r\n24th October, 1809, by the ringers of St. Philip's giving \"five times\r\nfifty claps, an interim with the same number of rounds, to honour the\r\nKing, Queen, the Royal Family, the Nation, and the loyal town of\r\nBirmingham.\" At six o'clock next morning the sluggards were aroused with\r\na second peal, and with little rest the bells were kept swinging the\r\nwhole day long, the finale coming with a performance of \"perpetual claps\r\nand clashings\" that must have made many a head ache. There was a Sunday\r\nschool jubilee celebrated September 14, 1831. The fiftieth year's\r\npastorate of Rev. John Angell James was kept September 12, 1855, and the\r\nJubilee Day of the Chapel in Carr's Lane, September 27, 1870; of Cannon\r\nStreet Chapel, July 16, 1856; of the Rev. G. Cheatle's pastorate, at\r\nLombard Street Chapel, January 11, 1860; of the Missionary Society,\r\nSeptember 15, 1864; of Pope Pius the Ninth, in 1877, when the Roman\r\nCatholics of this town sent him £1,230. being the third largest\r\ncontribution from England.\r\n\r\n~Jubilee Singers.~--This troupe of coloured minstrels gave their first\r\nentertainment here in the Town Hall April 9, 1874.\r\n\r\n~Jury Lists.~--According to the Jury Act, 6 George IV., the\r\nchurchwardens and overseers of every parish in England are required to\r\nmake out an alphabetical list before the 1st September in each year of\r\nall men residing in their respective parishes and townships qualified to\r\nserve on juries, setting forth at length their Christian and surname,\r\n&c. Copies of these lists, on the three first Sundays in September, are\r\nto be fixed on the principal door to every church, chapel, and other\r\npublic place of religious worship, with a notice subjoined that all\r\nappeals will be heard at the Petty Sessions, to be held within the last\r\nday of September. The jury list for persons resident in the borough, and\r\nfor several adjoining parishes, may be seen at the office of Mr. Alfred\r\nWalter, solicitor, Colmore Row, so that persons exempt may see if their\r\nnames are included.\r\n\r\n~Justices Of the Peace.~--The earliest named local Justices of the Peace\r\n(March 8, 1327) are \"William of Birmingham\" and \"John Murdak\" the only\r\ntwo then named for the county.--See \"_Magistrates_\".\r\n\r\n~Kidneys (Petrified).~--In olden days our footpaths, where paved at all,\r\nwere, as a rule, laid with round, hard pebbles, and many readers will be\r\nsurprised to learn that five years ago there still remained 50,000\r\nsquare yards of the said temper-trying paving waiting to be changed into\r\nmore modern bricks or stone. Little, however, as we may think of them,\r\nthe time has been when the natives were rather proud than otherwise of\r\ntheir pebbly paths, for, according to Bisset, when one returned from\r\nvisiting the metropolis, he said he liked everything in London very much\r\n\"except the pavement, for the stones were all so smooth, there was no\r\nfoothold!\"\r\n\r\n~King Edward's Place.~--Laid out in 1782 on a 99 years' lease, from\r\nGrammar School, at a ground rent of £28, there being built 31 houses,\r\nand two in Broad Street.\r\n\r\n~King's Heath.~--A little over three miles on the Alcester Road, in the\r\nParish of King's Norton, an outskirt of Moseley, and a suburb of\r\nBirmingham; has added a thousand to its population in the ten years from\r\ncensus 1871 to 1881, and promises to more than double it in the next\r\ndecennial period. The King's Heath and Moseley Institute, built in 1878,\r\nat the cost of Mr. J.H. Nettlefold, provides the residents with a\r\ncommodious hall, library, and news-room. There is a station here on the\r\nMidland line, and the alterations now in the course of being made on\r\nthat railway must result in a considerable, addition to the traffic and\r\nthe usefulness of the station, as a local depôt for coal, &c.\r\n\r\n~King's Norton.~--Mentioned in Domesday, and in the olden times was\r\nevidently thought of equal standing (to say the least) with its\r\nfive-miles-neighbour, Birmingham, as in James the First's reign there\r\nwas a weekly market (Saturdays) and ten fairs in the twelve months. The\r\nmarket the inhabitants now attend is to be found in this town, and the\r\nhalf-score of fairs has degenerated to what is known as \"King's Norton\r\nMop\" or October statute fair, for the hiring of servants and labourers,\r\nwhen the Lord of Misrule holds sway, the more's the pity. The King's\r\nNorton Union comprises part of the borough of Birmingham (Edgbaston), as\r\nwell as Balsall Heath, Harborne, Moseley, Northfield, Selly Oak, &c.,\r\nand part of it bids fair to become a manufacturing district of some\r\nextent, as there are already paper mills, rolling mills, screw works,\r\n&c., and the Smethwick men are rapidly advancing in its direction--the\r\nMidland Junction with the West Suburban line being also in the parish.\r\nThe fortified mansion, known as Hawkesley House, in this parish, was the\r\nscene of a contest in May, 1645, between King Charles' forces and the\r\nParliamentarians, who held it, the result being its capture, pillage,\r\nand destruction by fire.\r\n\r\n~Kirby's Pools.~--A well-known and favourite resort on the outskirt of\r\nthe borough, on the Bristol Road, and formerly one of the celebrated\r\ntaverns and tea gardens of past days. The publichouse (the \"Malt\r\nShovel\") having been extended and partially rebuilt, and the grounds\r\nbetter laid out, the establishment was re-christened, and opened as the\r\nBournbrook Hotel, at Whitsuntide, 1877.\r\n\r\n~Kossuth.~--Louis Kossuth, the ex-dictator of Hungary, was honoured with\r\na public welcome and procession of trades, &c., Nov. 10, 1851, and\r\nentertained at a banquet in Town Hall on the 12th. He afterwards\r\nappeared here May 7 and 8, 1856, in the _role_ of a public lecturer.\r\n\r\n~Kyott's Lake.~--A pool once existing where now is Grafton Road, Camp\r\nHill. There was another pool near it, known as Foul Lake.\r\n\r\n~Kyrle Society.~--So named after the character alluded to by Pope in his\r\n\"Moral Essays\":\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Who taught that heaven-directed spire to rise?\r\n  'The Man of Ross,' each lisping babe replies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Kyrle, who died Nov. 11, 1724, though not a native, resided at Ross\r\nnearly the whole of his long and loyal life of close on 90 years, and\r\nPope, who often visited the neighbourhood, there became acquainted with\r\nhim and his good works, and embalmed his memory in undying verse as an\r\nexample to future generations. A more benevolent lover of his fellowman\r\nthan Kyrle cannot be named, and a society for cultivating purity of\r\ntaste, and a delight in aiding the well-being of others, is rightly\r\ncalled after him. The Birmingham Kyrle Society was established in 1880,\r\nand frequent paragraphs in the local papers tell us of their doings, at\r\none time cheering the inmates of the institutions where the sick and\r\nunfortunate lie, with music and song, and at another distributing books,\r\npictures, and flowers, where they are prized by those who are too poor\r\nto purchase. The officers of the society will be pleased to hear from\r\ndonors, as let contributions of flowers or pictures be ever so many, the\r\nrecipients are far more numerous. Mr. Walliker, our philanthropic\r\npostmaster, is one of the vice-presidents, and the arrangements of the\r\nparcel post are peculiarly suited for forwarding parcels.\r\n\r\n~Lady Well.~--There is mention in a document dated 1347 of a \"dwelling\r\nin Egebaston Strete leading towards God well feld,\" and there can be no\r\ndoubt that this was an allusion to the Lady Well, or the well dedicated\r\nto the blessed Virgin, close to the old house that for centuries\r\nsheltered the priests that served St. Martin's, and which afterwards was\r\ncalled the Parsonage or Rectory. The well spring was most abundant, and\r\nwas never known to fail. The stream from it helped to supply the moat\r\nround the Parsonage, and there, joined by the waters from the higher\r\ngrounds in the neighbourhood of Holloway Head, and from the hill above\r\nthe Pinfold, it passed at the back of Edgbaston Street, by the way of\r\nSmithfield passage and Dean Street (formerly the course of a brook) to\r\nthe Manor House moat. The Ladywell Baths were historically famous and,\r\nas stated by Hutton, were the finest in the kingdom. The Holy Well of\r\nthe blessed Virgin still exists, though covered over and its waters\r\nallowed to flow into the sewers instead of the Baths, and any visitor\r\ndesirous of testing the water once hallowed for its purity must take his\r\ncourse down the mean alley known as Ladywell Walk, at the bend in which\r\nhe will find a dirty passage leading to a rusty iron pump, \"presented by\r\nSir E.S. Gooch, Bart., to the inhabitants of Birmingham,\" as\r\ncommemorated by an inscription on the dirty stone which covers the\r\nspring and its well. God's Well field is covered with workshops,\r\nstables, dirty backyards and grimy-looking houses, and the Baths are a\r\ntimber-yard.\r\n\r\n~Lambert.~--Birmingham had something to do with the fattening of the\r\ncelebrated Daniel Lambert, the heaviest lump of humanity this country\r\nhas yet produced, for he was an apprentice to Mr. John Taylor, button\r\nmaker, of Crooked Lane. His indentures were cancelled through his\r\nbecoming so fat and unwieldy, and he was sent back to his father, the\r\nthen governor of Leicester gaol. Daniel died June 21st, 1809, at\r\nStamford, where he was buried; his age was 39, and he weighed 52 stone\r\n11 lb. (at 14 lb. the stone), measuring 9 ft. 4 in. round the body, and\r\n3 ft. 1 in. round the thick of each of his legs.\r\n\r\n~Lancashire Distress.~--The accounts of the Local Fund raised for the\r\nrelief of the cotton operatives of Lancashire were published Aug. 3,\r\n1863, showing receipts amounting £15,115 4s. 10d.\r\n\r\n~Lamps.~--The number of ordinary lamps in the borough, under the control\r\nof the Public Works Department, on the 31st of December, 1882, was\r\n6,591, of which number 1,950 are regulated to consume 5.20 cubic feet,\r\nand the remainder, or 4,641, 4.30 cubic feet per hour; their cost\r\nrespectively inclusive of lighting, cleaning, and extinguishing, was £2\r\n12s. 4-1/2d., and £2 5s. 2-1/4d. per lamp per annum. In addition there\r\nare 93 special and 53 urinal lamps.\r\n\r\n~Lands.~--In Birmingham it is bought and sold by the square yard, and\r\nvery pretty prices are occasionally paid therefor; our agricultural\r\nfriends reckon by acres, roods, and perches. The Saxon \"hyde\" of land,\r\nas mentioned in Domesday Book and other old documents, was equivalent to\r\n100, or, as some read it, 120 acres; the Norman \"Carncase\" being\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\n~Land Agency.~--An International Land and Labour Agency was established\r\nat Birmingham by the Hon. Elihu Burritt in October, 1869; its object\r\nbeing to facilitate the settlement of English farmers and mechanics in\r\nthe United States, and also to supply American orders for English\r\nlabourers and domestic servants of all kinds. Large numbers of\r\nservant-girls in England, it was thought, would be glad to go to\r\nAmerica, but unable to pay their passage-money, and unwilling to start\r\nwithout knowing where they were to go on arriving. This agency advanced\r\nthe passage-money, to be deducted from the first wages; but, though the\r\nscheme was good and well meant, very little advantage was taken of the\r\nagency, and, like some other of the learned blacksmith's notions, though\r\na fair-looking tree, it bore very little fruit.\r\n\r\n~Land and Building Societies.~--Though frequently considered to be quite\r\na modern invention, the plan of a number uniting to purchase lands and\r\nhouses for after distribution, is a system almost as old as the hills.\r\nThe earliest record we have of a local Building Society dates from 1781,\r\nthough no documents are at hand to show its methods of working. On Jan.\r\n17, 1837, the books were opened for the formation of a Freehold Land and\r\nBuilding Society here, but its usefulness was very limited, and its\r\nexistence short. It was left to the seething and revolutionary days of\r\n1847-8, when the Continental nations were toppling over thrones and\r\nkicking out kings, for sundry of our men of light and leading to bethink\r\nthemselves of the immense political power that lay in the holding of the\r\nland, and how, by the exercise of the old English law, which gave the\r\nholder of a 40s. freehold the right of voting for the election of a\r\n\"knight of the shire,\" such power could be brought to bear on\r\nParliament, by the extension of the franchise in that direction. The\r\ntimes were out of joint, trade bad, and discontent universal, and the\r\npossession of a little bit of the land we live on was to be a panacea\r\nfor every abuse complained of, and the sure harbinger of a return of the\r\ndays when every Jack had Jill at his own fireside. The misery and\r\nstarvation existing in Ireland where small farms had been divided and\r\nsubdivided until the poor families could no longer derive a sustenance\r\nfrom their several moieties, was altogether overlooked, and \"friends of\r\nthe people\" advocated the wholesale settlement of the unemployed English\r\non somewhat similar small plots. Feargus O'Connor, the Chartist leader,\r\nstarted his National Land Society, and thousands paid in their weekly\r\nmites in hopes of becoming \"lords of the soil;\" estates here and there\r\nwere purchased, allotments made, cottages built, and many new homes\r\ncreated. But as figs do not grow on thistles, neither was it to be\r\nexpected that men from the weaving-sheds, or the mines, should be able\r\nto grow their own corn, or even know how to turn it into bread when\r\ngrown, and _that_ Utopian scheme was a failure. More wise in their\r\ngeneration were the men of Birmingham: they went not for country\r\nestates, nor for apple orchards or turnip fields. The wise sagaciousness\r\nof their leaders, and the Brums always play well at \"follow my leading,\"\r\nmade them go in for the vote, the full vote, and nothing but the vote.\r\nThe possession of a little plot on which to build a house, though really\r\nthe most important, was not the first part of the bargain by any means\r\nat the commencement. To get a vote and thus help upset something or\r\nsomebody was all that was thought of at the time, though now the case is\r\nrather different, few members of any of the many societies caring at\r\npresent so much for the franchise as for the \"proputty, proputty,\r\nproputty.\" Mr. James Taylor, jun., has been generally dubbed the \"the\r\nfather of the freehold land societies,\" and few men have done more than\r\nhim in their establishment, but the honour of dividing the first estate\r\nin this neighbourhood, we believe, must be given to Mr. William Benjamin\r\nSmith, whilome secretary of the Manchester Order of Odd Fellows, and\r\nafterwards publisher of the _Birmingham Mercury_ newspaper. Being\r\npossessed of a small estate of about eight acres, near to the Railway\r\nStation at Perry Barr, he had it laid out in 100 lots, which were sold\r\nby auction at Hawley's Temperance Hotel, Jan. 10, 1848, each lot being\r\nof sufficient value to carry a vote for the shire. The purchasers were\r\nprincipally members of an Investment and Permanent Benefit Building\r\nSociety, started January 4, 1847, in connection with the local branch of\r\nOddfellows, of which Mr. Smith was a chief official. Franchise Street,\r\nwhich is supposed to be the only street of its name in England, was the\r\nresult of this division of land, and as every purchaser pleased himself\r\nin the matter of architecture, the style of building may be called that\r\nof \"the free and easy.\" Many estates have been divided since then,\r\nthousands of acres in the outskirts being covered with houses where erst\r\nwere green fields, and in a certain measure Birmingham owes much of its\r\nextension to the admirable working of the several Societies. As this\r\ntown led the van in the formation of the present style of Land and\r\nBuilding Societies, it is well to note here their present general\r\nstatus. In 1850 there were 75 Societies in the kingdom, with about\r\n25,000 members, holding among them 35,000 shares, with paid-up\r\nsubscriptions amounting to £164,000. In 1880, the number of societies in\r\nEngland was 946, in Scotland, 53, and in Ireland 27. The number of\r\nmembers in the English societies was 320,076, in the scotch 11,902, and\r\nin the Irish 6,533. A return relating to these societies in England has\r\njust been issued, which shows that there are now 1,687 societies in\r\nexistence, with a membership of 493,271. The total receipts during the\r\nlast financial year amounted to £20,919,473. There were 1,528 societies\r\nmaking a return of liabilities, which were to the holders of shares\r\n£29,351,611, and to the depositors £16,351,611. There was a balance of\r\nunappropriated profit to the extent of £1,567,942. The assets came to\r\n£44,587,718. In Scotland there were 15,386 members of building\r\nsocieties; the receipts were £413,609, the liabilities to holders of\r\nshares amounted to £679,990, to depositors and other creditors £268,511;\r\nthe assets consisted of balance due on mortgage securities £987,987, and\r\namount invested in other securities and cash £67,618. In Ireland there\r\nwere 9,714 members of building societies; the receipts were £778,889,\r\nliabilities to the holders of shares £684,396, to depositors and others\r\n£432,356; the assets included balance due on mortgage securities\r\n£1,051,423, and amount invested in other securities £79,812. There were\r\n150 of the English societies whose accounts showed deficiencies\r\namounting to £27,850; two Scotch societies minus £862, but no Irish\r\nshort. It is a pity to have to record that there have been failures in\r\nBirmingham, foremost among them being that of the Victoria Land and\r\nBuilding Society, which came to grief in 1870, with liabilities\r\namounting to £31,550. The assets, including £5,627 given by the\r\ndirectors and trustees, and £886 contributed by other persons, realised\r\n£27,972. Creditors paid in full took £9,271, the rest receiving 8s. 9d.\r\nin the pound, and £4,897 being swallowed up in costs. The break-up of\r\nthe Midland Land and Investment Corporation (Limited) is the latest.\r\nThis Company was established in 1864, and by no means confined itself to\r\nprocuring sites for workmen's dwellings, or troubled about getting them\r\nvotes. According to its last advertisement, the authorised capital was\r\n£500,000, of which £248,900 had been subscribed, but only £62,225 called\r\nup, though the reserve fund was stated to be £80,000. What the dividend\r\nwill be is a matter for the future, and may not even be guessed at at\r\npresent. The chief local societies, and their present status, areas\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n_The Birmingham Freehold Land Society_ was started in 1848, and the\r\naggregate receipts up to the end of 1882 amounted to £680,132 12s. 7d.\r\nThe year's receipts were £20,978 16s. 5d., of which £11,479 represented\r\npayments made by members who had been alloted land on the estates\r\ndivided by the Society, there being, after payment of all expenses, a\r\nbalance of £11,779 12s. 9d. The number of members was then 772, and it\r\nwas calculated that the whole of the allotments made would be paid off\r\nin four years.\r\n\r\n_The Friendly Benefit Building Society_ was organised in 1859, and up to\r\nMidsummer, 1883, the sums paid in amounted to £340,000. The year's\r\nreceipts were £21,834 19s. 6d., of which £10,037 came from borrowers,\r\nwhose whole indebtedness would be cleared in about 5-1/2 years. The\r\nmembers on the books numbered 827, of whom 684 were investors and 143\r\nborrowers. The reserve fund stood at £5,704 5s. 9d There is a branch of\r\nthis Society connected with Severn Street Schools, and in a flourishing\r\ncondition, 32 members having joined during the year, and £2,800 having\r\nbeen received as contributions. The total amount paid in since the\r\ncommencement of the branch in June, 1876, was £18,181 13s. 11d. The\r\nSevern Street scholars connected with it had secured property during the\r\npast year valued at £2,400.\r\n\r\n_The Incorporated Building Society_ comprises the United, the Queen's,\r\nthe Freeholders', and the Second Freeholders' Societies, the earliest of\r\nthem established in 1849, the incorporation taking place in 1878. The\r\naggregate receipts of these several Societies would reach nearly 3-1/2\r\nmillions. The amounts paid in since the amalgamation (to the end of\r\n1882) being £1,049,667. As might be expected the present Society has a\r\nlarge constituency, numbering 6,220 members, 693 of whom joined in 1882.\r\nThe advances during the year reached £78,275, to 150 borrowers, being an\r\naverage of £500 to each. The amount due from borrowers was £482,000, an\r\naverage of £540 each. The amount due to investors was ££449,000, an\r\naverage of £84 each. The borrowers repaid last year £104,000, and as\r\nthere was £482,000 now due on mortgage accounts the whole capital of the\r\nsociety would be turned over in five years, instead of thirteen and a\r\nhalf, the period for which the money was lent. The withdrawals had been\r\n£85,409, which was considerably under the average, as the society had\r\npaid away since the amalgamation £520,000, or £104,000 per annum. The\r\namount of interest credited to investors was £19,779. A total of\r\n£100,000 had been credited in the last five years. The reserve fund now\r\namounted to £34,119, which was nearly 7-1/2 per cent. on the whole\r\ncapital employed.\r\n\r\n_The Birmingham Building Society, No. 1_, was established in May, 1842,\r\nand re-established in 1853. It has now 1,580 members, subscribing for\r\nshares amounting to £634,920. The last report states that during the\r\nexistence of the society over £500,000 has been advanced to members, and\r\nthat the amount of \"receipts and payments\" have reached the sum of\r\n£1,883,444. Reserve fund is put at £5,000.\r\n\r\n_The Birmingham Building Society, No. 4_, was established in June, 1846,\r\nand claims to be the oldest society in the town. The report, to end of\r\nJune, 1883, gave the number of shares as 801-3/4, of which 563-1/4\r\nbelong to investors, and the remainder to borrowers. The year's receipts\r\nwere £10,432, and £6,420 was advanced. The balance-sheet showed the\r\nunallotted share fund to be £18,042, on deposit £3,915, due to bank\r\n£2,108, and balance in favour of society £976. The assets amounted to\r\n£25,042, of which £21,163 was on mortgages, and £3,818 on properties in\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n_St. Philip's Building Society_ was began in January, 1850, since when\r\n(up to January, 1883) £116,674 had been advanced on mortgages, and\r\n£28,921 repaid to depositing members. The society had then 326 members,\r\nholding among them 1,094-1/4 shares. The year's receipts were £13,136,\r\nand £7,815 had been advanced in same period. The reserve fund was\r\n£3,642; the assets £65,940, of which £54,531 was on mortgages, £7,987\r\ndeferred premiums, and £2,757 properties in hand.\r\n\r\nSeveral societies have not favoured us with their reports.\r\n\r\n~Law.~--There are 306 solicitors and law firms in Birmingham, 19\r\nbarristers, and a host of students and law clerks, each and every one of\r\nwhom doubtless dreams of becoming Lord Chancellor. The Birmingham Law\r\nSociety was formed in 1818, and there is a Society of Law Students\r\nbesides, and a Law Library. At present, our Law Courts comprise the\r\nBankruptcy and County Courts, Assize Courts (held _pro tem_ in the\r\nCouncil House), the Quarter Sessions' and Petty Sessions' Courts.\r\n\r\n~League of Universal Brotherhood.~--Originated by Elihu Burritt, in\r\n1846, while sitting in the \"Angel,\" at Pershore, on his walk through\r\nEngland. He came back to Joseph Sturge and here was printed his little\r\nperiodical called \"The Bond of Brotherhood,\" leading to many\r\nInternational Addresses, Peace Congresses, and Olive-Leaf Missions, but\r\nalas! alas! how very far off still seems the \"universal peace\" thus\r\nsought to be brought about. Twenty thousand signatures were attached to\r\n\"The Bond\" in one year. Far more than that number have been slain in\r\nwarfare every year since.\r\n\r\n~Lease Lane.~--Apparently a corruption of Lea or Leay Lane, an ancient\r\nbye-road running at the back of the Dog or Talbot Inn, the owners of\r\nwhich, some 300 years ago, were named Leays. When the Market Hall was\r\nbuilt and sewers were laid round it, the workmen came upon what was at\r\nthe time imagined to be an underground passage, leading from the\r\nGuildhall in New Street to the old Church of St. Martin's. Local\r\nantiquarians at the time would appear to have been conspicuous by their\r\nabsence, as the workmen were allowed to close the passage with rubbish\r\nwithout a proper examination being made of it. Quite lately, however, in\r\ndigging out the soil for the extension of the Fish Market at a point on\r\nthe line of Lease Lane, about 60ft. from Bell Street, the workmen, on\r\nreaching a depth of 8ft. or 9ft., struck upon the same underground\r\npassage, but of which the original purpose was not very apparent. Cut in\r\nthe soft, sandstone, and devoid of any lining, it ran almost at right\r\nangles to Lease Lane, and proved to extend half way under that\r\nthoroughfare, and some four or five yards into the excavated ground.\r\nUnder Lease Lane it was blocked by rubbish, through which a sewer is\r\nbelieved to run, and therefore the exact ending of the passage in one\r\ndirection cannot be traced; in the excavated ground it ended, on the\r\nsite of a dismantled public-house, in a circular shaft, which may have\r\nbeen that of a well, or that of a cesspool. The passage, so far as it\r\nwas traceable, was 24ft. long, 7ft. high, and 4-1/2ft. wide. As to its\r\nuse before it was severed by the sewerage of Lease Lane, the conjecture\r\nis that it afforded a secret means of communication between two houses\r\nseparated above ground by that thoroughfare, but for what purpose must\r\nremain one of the perplexing puzzles of the past. That it had no\r\nconnection with the Church or the Grammar School (the site of the old\r\nGuild House) is quite certain, as the course of the passage was in a\r\ndifferent direction.\r\n\r\n~Leasing Wives.~--In the histories of sundry strange lands we read of\r\ncurious customs appertaining to marriage and the giving in marriage.\r\nTaking a wife on trial is the rule of more than one happy clime, but\r\ntaking a wife upon lease is quite a Brummagem way of marrying (using the\r\nterm in the manner of many detractors of our town's fair fame). In one\r\nof the numbers of the _Gentleman's Magazine_, for the year 1788, Mr.\r\nSylvanus Urban, as the editor has always been called, is addressed as\r\nfollows by a Birmingham correspondent:--\"Since my residing in this town\r\nI have often heard there is a method of obtaining a wife's sister upon\r\nlease. I never could learn the method to be taken to get a wife upon\r\nlease, or whether such connections are sanctioned by law; but there is\r\nan eminent manufacturer in the vicinity of this town who had his\r\ndeceased wife's sister upon lease for twenty years and upwards; and I\r\nknow she went by his name, enjoyed all the privileges, and received all\r\nthe honours due to the respectable name of wife.\" A rarer case of\r\nmarital leasing has often been noted against us by the aforesaid\r\nsmirchers of character as occurring in 1853, but in reality it was\r\nrather an instance of hiring a husband.\r\n\r\n~Leather Hall.~--As early as the Norman Conquest this town was famed for\r\nits tanneries, and there was a considerable market, for leather for\r\ncenturies after. Two of the Court Leet officers were \"Leather Sealers,\"\r\nand part of the proclamation made by the Crier of the Court when it held\r\nits meetings was in those words, \"All whyte tawers that sell not good\r\nchaffer as they ought to do reasonably, and bye the skynnes in any other\r\nplace than in towne or market, ye shall do us to weet,\" meaning that\r\nanyone knowing of such offences on the part of the \"whyte tawers\" or\r\ntanners should give information at the Court then assembled. New Street\r\noriginally was entered from High Street, under an arched gateway, and\r\nhere was the Leather Hall (which was still in existence in Hutton's\r\ntime), where the \"Sealers\" performed their functions. It was taken down\r\nwhen New Street was opened out, and though we have an extensive hide and\r\nskin market now, we can hardly be said to possess a market for leather\r\nother than the boot and shoe shops, the saddlers, &c.\r\n\r\n~Lench's Trust.~--See \"_Philanthropic Institutions_.\"\r\n\r\n~Liberal Association.~--On Feb. 17, 1865, a meeting was held in the\r\ncommittee room of the Town Hall for the purpose of forming an\r\norganisation which should \"unite all the Liberals of the town, and\r\nprovide them with a regular and efficient method of exercising a\r\n_legitimate_ influence in favour of their political principles.\" The\r\noutcome of this meeting was the birth of the now famous Liberal\r\n\"Caucus,\" and though the names of ten gentlemen were appended to the\r\nadvertisement calling the meeting, the honour of the paternity of the\r\nLiberal bantling is generally given to Mr. William Harris. The governing\r\nbody of the association was fixed at two dozen, inclusive of the\r\npresident, vice, and secretary; all persons subscribing a shilling or\r\nmore per annum being eligible to become members. The \"General\r\nCommittee,\" for some time known as the \"Four Hundred,\" was enlarged in\r\n1876 to Six Hundred, and in June, 1880, to Eight Hundred, the Executive\r\nCommittee, at the same time, being considerably increased. The recent\r\nalteration in the franchise, and the division of the borough and\r\noutskirts into seven electoral districts, has led to a reorganisation of\r\nthe Association, or Associations, for each of the seven divisions now\r\nworks by itself, though guided by a central Council.--A \"Women's Liberal\r\nAssociation\" was founded in October, 1873, and a \"Junior Liberal\r\nAssociation\" in October, 1878.\r\n\r\n~Libraries.~--The first public or semi-public library founded in\r\nBirmingham, was the Theological. In 1733 the Rev. William Higgs, first\r\nRector of St. Philip's, left his collection of 550 volumes, and a sum of\r\nmoney, to found a library for the use of clergymen and students. The\r\nbooks, many of which are rare, are kept in a building erected in 1792,\r\nadjacent to the Rectory, and are accessible to all for whom the library\r\nwas designed.--A Circulating Library was opened in Colmore Row, in 1763,\r\nand at one time there was a second-class institution of the kind at a\r\nhouse up one of the courts in Dale End.--A \"New Library\" was opened in\r\nCannon Street, April 26, 1796, which was removed to Temple Row, in 1821,\r\nand afterwards united to the Old Library. The latter was commenced in\r\n1779, the first room for the convenience of members being opened in\r\n1782, and the present building in Union Street, erected in 1798. The\r\nreport of the committee for the year 1882 showed that there were 772\r\nproprietors, at 21s. per annum; 35 annual subscribers, at 31s. 6d. per\r\nannum; 528 at 2ls.; 6 quarterly, at 9s. per quarter; 53 at 6s. per\r\nquarter; 17 resident members of subscribers' families, at 10s. per\r\nannum; and 118 resident members of subscribers' families (readers) at\r\n5s. The total number of members was 1,479; the year's subscriptions\r\nbeing £1,594. The price of shares has been raised from two to three\r\nguineas during the past year. Receipts from shares, fines, &c., amounted\r\nto about £480, making the amount actually received in 1882, £2,012 6s.\r\nThe expenditure had been £1,818 19s. 9d., inclusive of £60 carried to\r\nthe reserve fund, and £108 paid on account of the new catalogue; and\r\nthere remained a balance of £198 6s. 1d. in hand. £782 0s. 9d. had been\r\nexpended on the purchase of 1,560 additional books, re-binding others,\r\n&c., making a total of about 50,000 volumes. The library needs\r\nextension, but the shortness of the lease (thirty years only) and the\r\nhigh value of the adjoining land prevents any step being taken in that\r\ndirection at present. The Birmingham Law Society's Library was founded\r\nin February, 1831, by Mr. Arthur Ryland, and has now nearly 6,000\r\nvolumes of law works, law reports (English, Scotch, and Irish), local\r\nand personal Acts, &c., &c. The present home in Wellington Passage was\r\nopened August 2, 1876, being far more commodious than the old abode in\r\nWaterloo-street, the \"library\" itself being a room 35ft. long, 22ft.\r\nwide, and 20ft. high, with a gallery round it. There are several\r\nextensive libraries connected with places of worship, such as the Church\r\nof the Saviour, Edward Street, Severn Street Schools, the Friends'\r\nMeeting House, &c. and a number of valuable collections in the hands of\r\nsome well-known connoisseurs, literati, and antiquarians, access to most\r\nof which may be obtained on proper introduction.\r\n\r\n~Libraries (The Free).~--The first attempt to found a Free Library in\r\nthis town was the holding of a public meeting in April, 1852, under the\r\nprovisions of the Museums and Libraries Act of 1850, which allowed of a\r\n1/2d. rate being levied for the support of such institutions. Whether\r\nthe townsfolk were careless on the subject, or extra careful, and\r\ntherefore, doubtful of the sufficiency of the 1/2d. rate to provide\r\nthem, is not certain; but so little interest was shown in the matter\r\nthat only 534 persons voted for the adoption of the Act, while 363 voted\r\nagainst it, and the question for the time was shelved, as the Act\r\nrequired the assents to be two-thirds of the total votes given. In 1855\r\nthe Commissioner of patents presented to the town some 200 volumes,\r\nconditionally that they should be kept in a _Free_ Library, and about\r\nthe same time another proposal was made to establish such a Library, but\r\nto no effect. The Act was altered so that a penny rate could be made,\r\nand in October, 1859, it was again suggested to try the burgesses. On\r\nFebruary 21, 1860, the meeting was held and the adoption of the Act\r\ncarried by a large majority. A committee of sixteen, eight members of\r\nthe Council, and eight out if it, was chosen, and in a short time their\r\nwork was shown by the transfer of 10,000 square feet of land belonging\r\nto the Midland Institute, on which to erect a central library, the\r\npreparations of plans therefor, the purchase of books, and (April 3,\r\n1861) the opening of the first branch library and reading room in\r\nConstitution Hill. Mr. E.M. Barry, the architect of the Midland\r\nInstitute, put in designs, including Art Gallery, but his figures were\r\ntoo high, being £14,250 10s., the Town Council having only voted\r\n£10,500. The plans of Mr. W. Martin, whose estimate was £12,000 were\r\nadopted, the Council added £1,500, a loan for the cash was negotiated,\r\nand building commenced by Messrs. Branson and Murray, whose tender to do\r\nthe work for £8,600 was accepted. Thirty-two applications for the chief\r\nlibrarianship at £200 per annum were sent in, the chosen man being Mr.\r\nJ.D. Mullins, though he was not the one recommended by the Committee.\r\nThe Central Lending Library (with 10,000 volumes) and Reading-room, with\r\nArt Gallery, was formally opened September 6, 1865, and the Reference\r\nLibrary (then containing 18,200 volumes) October 26, 1866. In 1869, the\r\nlatter was much enlarged by the purchase of 604 square yards of land in\r\nEdmund Street, and the total cost of the building came to £14,896. The\r\nBranch Library at Adderley Park was opened January 11, 1864; that at\r\nDeritend Oct. 2, 1866, and at Gosta Green Feb. 1, 1868. At the end of\r\n1870, the total number of volumes in the whole of the Libraries was\r\n56,764, of which 26,590 were in the Reference, and 12,595 in the Central\r\nLending Library. By 1877, the total number of volumes had reached\r\n86,087, of which 46,520 were in the Reference, and 17,543 in the Central\r\nLending, the total number of borrowers being 8,947 at the Central, 4,188\r\nat Constitution Hill, 3,002 at Deritend, 2,668 at Gosta Green, and 271\r\nat Adderley Park. Meantime several new features in connection with the\r\nReference Library had appeared. A room had been fitted up and dedicated\r\nto the reception of the \"Shakespeare Memorial Library,\" presented April\r\n23, 1864; the \"Cervantes Library,\" presented by Mr. Bragge, was opened\r\non a similar date in 1873; the \"Staunton Collection\" purchased for\r\n£2,400, (not half its value) was added Sept. 1, 1875, and very many\r\nimportant additions had been made to the Art Gallery and incipient\r\nMuseum. For a long time, the Free Libraries' Committee had under\r\nconsideration the necessity of extending the building, by adding a wing,\r\nwhich should be used not only as an Art Gallery, but also as an\r\nIndustrial Museum; the Art Gallery and its treasures being located in\r\nthat portion of the premises devoted to the Midland Institute, which was\r\nfound to be a very inconvenient arrangement. The subject came under the\r\nnotice of the Council on February 19th, 1878, when the committee\r\nsubmitted plans of the proposed alterations. These included the erection\r\nof a new block of buildings fronting Edmund Street, to consist of three\r\nstoreys. The Town Council approved the plans, and granted £11,000 to\r\ndefray the cost of the enlargement. About Midsummer the committee\r\nproceeded to carry out the plans, and in order to do this it was\r\nnecessary to remove the old entrance hall and the flight of stairs which\r\nled up to the Shakespeare Memorial Library and to the Reference Library,\r\nand to make sundry other alterations of the buildings. The Library was\r\nclosed for several days, and in the meantime the walls, where the\r\nentrances were, were pulled down and wooden partitions were run up\r\nacross the room, making each department of much smaller area than\r\nbefore. In addition to this a boarded-in staircase was erected in Edmund\r\nStreet, by which persons were able to gain access to the Lending\r\nLibrary, which is on the ground floor, and to the Reference Library,\r\nwhich was immediately above. A similar staircase was made in\r\nRatcliff-place, near the cab stand, for the accommodation of the members\r\nof the Midland Institute, who occupy the Paradise-street side of the\r\nbuilding. The space between the two staircases was boarded up, in order\r\nto keep the public off the works during the alterations, and the\r\nnecessary gas supply pipes, &c., were located outside these wooden\r\npartitions. The alterations were well advanced by Christmas, and\r\neverything bade fair for an early and satisfactory completion of the\r\nundertaking. The weather, however, was most severe, and now and then the\r\nmoisture in the gas-pipes exposed to the air became frozen. This\r\noccurred on the afternoon of Saturday, January 11, 1879, and an employé\r\nof the gas office lit a gas jet to thaw one of the pipes, A shaving was\r\nblown by the wind across this light, it blazed; the flame caught other\r\nshavings, which had been packed round the pipe to keep the frost out,\r\nand in less than a minute the fire was inside, and in one hour the\r\nBirmingham Reference Library was doomed to destruction. It was the\r\ngreatest loss the town had ever suffered, but a new building has arisen\r\non the site, and (with certain exceptions) it is hoped that a more\r\nperfect and valuable Library will be gathered to fill it. In a few days\r\nafter the fire it was decided to ask the public at large for at least\r\n£10,000 towards a new collection, and within a week £7,000 had been sent\r\nin, the principal donors named in the list being--\r\n\r\n                                                £    s.\r\nThe Mayor (Mr. Jesse Collins).  ..  ..  ..     100   0\r\nAlderman Chamberlain, M.P.

The precaution of insuring such an institution and its contents\r\nhad of course been taken, and most fortunately the requisite\r\nendorsements on the policies had been made to cover the extra risk\r\naccruing from the alteration in progress. The insurances were made in\r\nthe \"Lancashire\" and \"Yorkshire\" offices, the buildings for £10,000, the\r\nReference Library for £12,000, the Lending Library for £1,000, the\r\nShakespeare Library for £1,500, the Prince Consort statue for £1,000,\r\nthe models of Burke and Goldsmith for £100, and the bust of Mr. Timmins\r\nfor £100, making £25,700 in all. The two companies hardly waited for the\r\nclaim to be made, but met it in a most generous manner, paying over at\r\nonce £20,000, of which £10,528 has been devoted to the buildings and\r\nfittings, nearly £500 paid for expenses and injury to statues, and the\r\nremaining £9,000 put to the book purchase fund. In the Reference Library\r\nthere were quite 48,000 volumes, in addition to about 4,000 of patent\r\nspecifications. Every great department of human knowledge was\r\nrepresented by the best known works. In history, biography, voyages, and\r\ntravels, natural history, fine arts, all the greatest works, not only in\r\nEnglish, but often in the principal European languages, had been\r\ngathered. Volumes of maps and plans, engravings of all sorts of\r\nantiquities, costumes, weapons, transactions of all the chief learned\r\nsocieties, and especially bibliography, or \"books about books\" had been\r\ncollected with unceasing care, the shelves being loaded with costly and\r\nvaluable works rarely found out of the great libraries of London, or\r\nOxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, or Glasgow. Among the collections lost\r\nwere many volumes relating to the early history of railways in England,\r\noriginally collected by Mr. Charles Brewin, and supplemented by all the\r\npamphlets and tracts procurable. Many of those volumes were full of\r\ncuttings from contemporary newspapers, and early reports of early\r\nrailway companies, and of the condition of canals and roads. Still more\r\nvaluable were many bundles of papers, letters, invoices, calculations,\r\netc., concerning the early attempt to establish the cotton manufacture\r\nin Birmingham at the beginning of the last century, including the papers\r\nof Warren, the printer, and some letters of Dr. Johnson, and others\r\nrelating the story of the invention of spinning by rollers--the work of\r\nJohn Wyatt and Lewis Paul--long before Arkwright's time. Among the\r\nimmense collection of Birmingham books and papers were hundreds of Acts\r\nof Parliament, Birmingham Almanacs, Directories (from 1770) most\r\ncurious, valuable, and rare; a heap of pamphlets on the Grammar School,\r\nBirmingham History, Topography, and Guides; the political pamphlets of\r\nJob Nott and John Nott, some of which were the only copies known, the\r\nmore ancient pamphlets describing Prince Rupert's Burning Love (date\r\n1613) and others of that time; reports from the year 1726 of the several\r\nlocal learned institutions; an invaluable collection of maps; programmes\r\nof the Festivals; and copies of all the known Birmingham newspapers and\r\nperiodicals (some being perfect sets) etc., etc. Of all the host not\r\nmore than 1,000 volumes were saved. The fame of the Shakespeare Memorial\r\nLibrary at Birmingham was world-wide and to us it had extra value as\r\nemanating from the love which George Dawson bore for the memory of\r\nShakespeare. It was his wish that the library should be possessed of\r\nevery known edition of the bard's works in every language, and that it\r\nshould contain every book ever printed about him or his writings. In the\r\nwords of Mr. Timmins, \"The devotion of George Dawson to Shakespeare was\r\nnot based upon literary reasons alone, nor did it only rest upon his\r\nadmiration and his marvel at the wondrous gifts bestowed upon this\r\ngreatest of men, but it was founded upon his love for one who loved so\r\nmuch. His heart, which knew no inhumanity, rejoiced in one who was so\r\ngreatly human, and the basis of his reverence for Shakespeare was his\r\nown reverence for man. It was thus, to him, a constant pleasure to mark\r\nthe increasing number of the students of Shakespeare, and to see how,\r\nfirst in one language and then in another, attempts were made to bring\r\nsome knowledge of his work to other nations than the English-speaking\r\nones; and the acquisition of some of these books by the library was\r\nreceived by him with delight, not merely or not much for acquisition\r\nsake, but as another evidence of the ever-widening influence of\r\nShakespeare's work. The contents of this library were to Mr. Dawson a\r\ngreat and convincing proof that the greatest of all English authors had\r\nnot lived fruitlessly, and that the widest human heart the world has\r\nknown had not poured out its treasure in vain.\" So successful had the\r\nattempts of the collectors been that nearly 7,000 volumes had been\r\nbrought together, many of them coming from the most distant parts of the\r\nglobe. The collection included 336 editions of Shakspeare's complete\r\nworks in English, 17 in French, 58 in German, 3 in Danish, 1 in Dutch, 1\r\nin Bohemian, 3 in Italian, 4 in Polish, 2 in Russian, 1 in Spanish, 1 in\r\nSwedish; while in Frisian, Icelandic, Hebrew, Greek, Servian,\r\nWallachian, Welsh, and Tamil there were copies of many separate plays.\r\nThe English volumes numbered 4,500, the German 1,500, the French 400.\r\nThe great and costly editions of Boydell and Halliwell, the original\r\nfolios of 1632, 1664, and 1685, the very rare quarto contemporary issues\r\nof various plays, the valuable German editions, the matchless collection\r\nof \"ana,\" in contemporary criticism, reviews, &c., and the interesting\r\ngarnering of all the details of the Tercentenary Celebration--\r\nwall-posters, tickets, pamphlets, caricatures, &c., were all to be found\r\nhere, forming the largest and most varied collection of Shakspeare's\r\nworks, and the English and foreign literature illustrating them, which\r\nhas ever been made, and the greatest literary memorial which any author\r\nhas ever yet received. So highly was the library valued that its\r\ncontents were consulted from Berlin and Paris, and even from the United\r\nStates, and similar libraries have been founded in other places. Only\r\n500 of the books were preserved, and many of them were much damaged. The\r\nloss of the famed Staunton or Warwickshire collection was even worse\r\nthan that of the Shakespearean, rich and rare as that was, for it\r\nincluded the results of more than two centuries' patient work, from the\r\ndays of Sir William Dugdale down to the beginning of the present\r\ncentury. The manuscript collections of Sir Simon Archer, fellow-labourer\r\nof Dugdale, the records of the Berkeley, Digby, and Ferrers families,\r\nthe valued and patient gatherings of Thomas Sharpe, the Coventry\r\nantiquarian, of William Hamper, the Birmingham collector, and of William\r\nStaunton himself, were all here, forming the most wonderful county\r\ncollection ever yet formed, and which a hundred years' work will never\r\nreplace. The books, many rare or unique, and of extraordinary value,\r\ncomprised over 2000 volumes; there were hundreds of sketches and\r\nwater-colour drawings of buildings long since destroyed, and more than\r\n1,500 engravings of various places in the county, among them being some\r\n300 relating to Birmingham, 200 to Coventry, 200 to Warwick Castle, 200\r\nto Kenilworth Castle, and more than 100 to Stratford-on-Avon. The\r\nthousand portraits of Warwickshire Worthies, more rare and valuable\r\nstill, included no less than 267 distinct portraits of Shakespeare,\r\nevery one from a different block or plate. There was, in fact,\r\neverything about Warwickshire which successive generations of learned\r\nand generous collectors could secure. Among other treasures were\r\nhundreds of Acts of Parliament, all pedigrees, pamphlets, &c., about the\r\nEarls of Warwick and the town of Warwick; the original vellum volume\r\nwith the installation of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, to the Order\r\nof St. Michael, with his own autograph; volumes of rare, curious\r\nautographs of county interest; county poll books, newspapers and\r\nmagazines; all the rare Civil War pamphlets relating to the Warwickshire\r\nincidents; ancient deeds, indulgences, charters, seals, rubbings of\r\nbrasses long lost or worn away, medals, coins, hundreds in number; and\r\nrare and invaluable volumes, like the Duc de Nortombria's \"Arcano de\r\nMare,\" and two fine copies of Dugdale's Warwickshire; besides hundreds\r\nof books, engravings, caricatures, pamphlets and tracts. The catalogue\r\nof this precious collection had only recently been completed, but even\r\nthat was burnt, so that there is nothing left to show the full extent of\r\nthe loss sustained. The only salvage consisted of three books, though\r\nmost providentially one of the three was the splendid Cartulary of the\r\nPriory of St. Anne, at Knowle, a noble vellum folio, richly illuminated\r\nby some patient scribe four centuries ago, and preserving not only the\r\nnames of the benefactors of the Priory, and details of its possessions,\r\nbut also the service books of the Church, with the ancient music and\r\nilluminated initials, as fresh and perfect as when first written. Of\r\nalmost inestimable value, it has now an acquired interest in the fact of\r\nits being, so to speak, all that remains of all the great Staunton\r\ncollection. The Cervantes Library, which had taken him a quarter of a\r\ncentury to gather together, was presented by Mr. William Bragge. For\r\nmany years, even in a busy life, Mr. Bragge, in his visits to Spain and\r\nhis travels all over Europe, had been able to collect nearly all the\r\nknown editions, not only of \"Don Quixote,\" but of all the other works of\r\nCervantes. Not only editions, but translations into any and every\r\nlanguage were eagerly sought; and, after cherishing his treasures for\r\nmany years, Mr. Bragge was so impressed with the Shakespeare Library\r\nthat he generously offered his unrivalled collection of the great\r\ncontemporary author to the town of which he is a native, and in which he\r\nafterwards came to live. The collection extended from editions published\r\nin 1605 down to our own days, and included many very rare and very\r\ncostly illustrated volumes, which can never be replaced. All the known\r\ntranslations were among the thousand volumes, and all the works were in\r\nthe choicest condition, but only ten survived the fire.--From the\r\nLending Library about 10,000 volumes were rescued, and as there were\r\nnearly 4,000 in the hands of readers, the loss here was comparatively\r\nsmall. The present number of books in the Reference Library bids fair to\r\nsurpass the collection lost, except, of course, as regards the\r\nShakespeare, Cervantes, and Staunton gatherings, the latter of which it\r\nis simply impossible to replace, while it will take many years to make\r\nup the other two. There are now (March, 1884) over 54,000 volumes on the\r\nshelves, including 4,300 saved from the fire, about 33,000 purchased,\r\nand nearly 17,000 presented. Among the latter are many rare and costly\r\nworks given to Birmingham soon after the catastrophe by a number of\r\nsocieties and gentlemen connected with the town, as well as others at\r\nhome and abroad. To catalogue the names of all donors is impossible, but\r\na few of those who first contributed may be given. Foremost, many of the\r\nbooks being of local character, was the gift of Mr. David Malins, which\r\nincluded Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle, 1492, one vol.; Camden's\r\nBritannia, ed. Gibson, 1695, one vol.; Ackermann's London, Westminster\r\nAbbey, Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, &c., ten vols.; Works of\r\nSamuel Parr, 1828, eight vols.; Illustrated Record of European Events,\r\n1812-1815, one vol.; Thompson's Seasons, illustrated by Bartolozzi, and\r\nother works, seventy vols.; Notes and Queries (complete set of five\r\nseries), 1850-78, fifty-seven vols.; Dugdale's \"Warwickshire, 1656, and\r\nother books relating to Birmingham, Warwickshire and neighbourhood,\r\nseventy-four vols.; books printed by Baskerville, ten vols.;\r\nBirmingham-printed books, 203 vols.; books on or by Birmingham authors,\r\nfifty-six vols.; total, 491 vols.; in addition to a collection of about\r\n600 portraits, maps and views relating to Birmingham, Warwickshire and\r\nthe neighbourhood, including sixty portraits of Shakespeare. The\r\nManchester Town Council sent us from their Public Library about 300\r\nvolumes, among which may be named the edition of Barclay's Apology\r\nprinted by Baskerville (1765); a fine copy of the folio edition of Ben\r\nJohnson (1640); the Duke of Newcastle's New Method to Dress Horses\r\n(1667); several volumes of the Maitland Club books, the catalogue of the\r\nHarleian MSS (1759); two tracts of Socinus (1618); the Foundations of\r\nManchester (4 vols.); Daulby's Rembrandt Catalogue; Weever's Funeral\r\nMonuments (1631); Visconti's Egyptian Antiquities (1837); Heylyn's\r\nHistory of St. George (1633), and Nicholl's History of English Poor Law.\r\nThere are also a considerable number of works of science and general\r\nliterature of a more modern date. The trustees of the British Museum\r\ngave about 150 works, relating to Greek, Egyptian, Syrian, Phoenician,\r\nand other antiquities, to various departments of natural science, and\r\nother interesting matters, the whole constituting a valuable\r\ncontribution towards the restored library. The Science and Art\r\nDepartment of South Kensington sent a selection of catalogues,\r\nchromo-lithographs, books of etchings, photographs, &c. Dr. F.A. Leo, of\r\nBerlin, sent a splendid copy of his valuable _fac-simile_ of \"Four\r\nChapters of North's Plutarch,\" illustrating Shakespeare's Roman plays,\r\nto replace his former gift-volume lost in the calamitous fire. The\r\nvolume is one of twenty-four copies, and the learned Professor added a\r\nprinted dedication as a record of the fire and the loss. Dr. Delius, of\r\nBonn, Herr Wilhelm Oechelhaüser, of Dessau, and other German Shakespeare\r\nauthors sent copies of their works. Mr. J. Payne Collier offered copies\r\nof his rare quarto reprints of Elizabethan books, to replace those which\r\nhad been lost. Mr. Gerald Massey offered a copy of his rare volume on\r\nShakespeare's Sonnets, \"because it is a Free Library.\" Mr. H. Reader\r\nLack offered a set of the Patent Office volumes from the limited number\r\nat his disposal as Chief of the Patent Office. Dr. Kaines, of Trinder\r\nRoad, London, selected 100 volumes from his library for acceptance; Mrs.\r\nand Miss L. Toulmin Smith sent all they could make up of the works of\r\nMr. J. Toulmin Smith, and of his father, Mr. W. Hawkes Smith, both\r\nnatives of our town; Messrs. Low, Son, and Co., gave 120 excellent\r\nvolumes; Messrs. W. and R. Chambers, Messrs. Crosby, Lockwood, and Co.,\r\nand other publishers, valuable books; Mr. James Coleman his \"Index to\r\nPedigrees,\" \"Somerset House Registers,\" and \"William Penn Pedigrees;\"\r\nMiss N. Bradley (Bath) the new reissue of Professor Ruskin's works; Mr.\r\nH.W. Adnitt (Shrewsbury) his reprint of Gough's curious \"History of\r\nMyddie,\" and of Churchyard's \"Miserie of Flaunders,\" and \"The Four\r\nMinisters of Salop:\" Mr. H.F. Osle presented a, fine collection of Art\r\nbooks, including Grüner's great work, and Mr. J.H. Stone made a valuable\r\ndonation of the same kind. The above are mere items in the list of\r\ngenerous donors, and gives but small idea of the many thousands of\r\nvolumes which have streamed in from all parts. Many indeed have been the\r\nvaluable gifts and additions by purchase since the fire, one of the\r\nlatest being nearly the whole of the almost priceless collection of\r\nBirmingham books, papers, &c., belonging to Mr. Sam. Timmins. The sum of\r\n£1,100 was paid him for a certain portion of backs, but the number he\r\nhas given at various times is almost past count. Immediate steps were\r\ntaken after the fire to get the lending department of the Library into\r\nwork again, and on the 9th of June, 1879, a commodious (though rather\r\ndark) reading room was opened in Eden Place, the Town Council allowing a\r\nnumber of rooms in the Municipal Buildings to be used by the Libraries\r\nCommittee. In a little time the nucleus of the new Reference gathering\r\nwas also in hand, and for three years the institution sojourned with the\r\nCouncil. The new buildings were opened June 1st, 1882, and the date\r\nshould be recorded as a day of rejoicing and thanksgiving. The Reference\r\ndepartment was opened to readers on the 26th of the same month. In place\r\nof the hired rooms so long used as a library in Constitution Hill, there\r\nhas been erected in the near neighbourhood a neat two-storey building\r\nwhich will accommodate some 2,000 readers per day, and the shelves are\r\nsupplied with about 7,000 volumes. This new library was opened July 18,\r\n1883. To summarise this brief history of the Birmingham Free Libraries\r\nit is well to state that £78,000 has been spent on them, of which\r\n£36,392 has been for buildings. The cost of the Central Library so far\r\nhas been £55,000, the remaining £23,000 being the expenditure on the\r\nbranch libraries. The present annual cost is £9,372, of which £3,372\r\ngoes for interest and sinking fund, so that an addition must soon be\r\nmade to the 1d. rate, which produces £6,454. The power to increase the\r\nrate is given in the last Act of Parliament obtained by the Corporation.\r\nAt the end of 1882 the Reference Library contained 50,000 volumes. The\r\nnumber of books in the Central Lending Library was 21,394, while the\r\nbranch lending libraries contained--Constitution Hill, 7,815; Deritend,\r\n8,295; Gosta Green, 8,274; and Adderley Park, 3,122. The aggregate of\r\nall the libraries was 98,900 volumes. The issues of books during 1882\r\nwere as follows:--Reference Library, 202,179; Central Lending Library,\r\n186,988; Constitution Hill, 73,705; Deriteud, 70,218; Gosta Green,\r\n56,160; Adderley Park, 8,497; total, 597,747; giving a daily average of\r\n2,127 issues. These figures are exclusive of the Sunday issues at the\r\nReference Library, which numbered 25,095. The average number of readers\r\nin the Reference Library on Sundays has been 545; and the average\r\nattendance at all the libraries shows something like 55,000 readers per\r\nweek, 133 different weekly and monthly periodicals being put on the\r\ntables for their use, besides the books. At a meeting of the School\r\nBoard, June 4, 1875, permission was given to use the several infants'\r\nschoolrooms connected with the Board Schools, as evening reading rooms\r\nin connection with the libraries.\r\n\r\n_The Shakespeare Memorial Library_, though to all intents and purposes\r\npart and parcel of the Reference Library, has a separate and distinct\r\nhistory. Mr. Sam. Timmins, who is generally credited with having (in\r\n1858) first suggested the formation of a library, which should consist\r\nsolely of Shakespeare's works, and Shakespeareana of all possible kinds,\r\nsaid, at the tercentenary meeting, that the idea originated with George\r\nDawson, but perhaps the honour should be divided, as their mutual\r\nappreciation of the greatest poet whose genius has found utterance in\r\nour language is well known. The first practical step taken was the\r\nmeeting, held (July 10, 1863) of gentlemen interested in the\r\ntercentenary, for the purpose of considering a proposal to celebrate\r\nthat event by the formation of a Shakespearean library. The Rev. Charles\r\nEvans, head master of King Edward's School, presided. The following\r\nresolution, moved by Mr. G. Dawson, and seconded by the Rev. S. Bache,\r\nwas adopted:--\"That it is desirable to celebrate the tercentenary of the\r\nbirth of Shakespeare by the formation of a Shakespearean library,\r\ncomprising the various editions of the poet's works, and the literature\r\nand works of art connected therewith, and to associate such library with\r\nthe Borough Central Reference Library, in order that it may be\r\npermanently preserved.\" A hundred pounds were subscribed at this\r\nmeeting, and a committee formed to proceed with the project. In a very\r\nfew months funds rolled in, and Shakespeareans from all parts of the\r\nworld sent willing contributions to this the first Shakespearean library\r\never thought of. It was determined to call it a \"Memorial\" library, in\r\nhonour of the tercentenary of 1864, and on the poet's day of that year,\r\nthe library was formally presented to the town at a breakfast given at\r\nNock's Hotel by the Mayor (Mr. W. Holliday). Dr. Miller, George Dawson,\r\nM.D. Hill (Recorder), T.C.S. Kynnersley, R.W. Dale, Sam. Timmins, and\r\nothers took part in the proceedings, and the Mayor, on behalf of the\r\nFree Libraries Committee, accepted the gift on the terms agreed to by\r\nthe Town Council, viz., that the Library should be called \"The\r\nShakespearean Memorial Library,\" that a room should be specially and\r\nexclusively appropriated for the purposes thereof; that the library\r\nshould be under the same regulations as the Reference Library; and that\r\nthe Free Libraries' Committee should maintain and augment it, and accept\r\nall works appertaining to Shakespeare that might be presented, &c. As\r\nGeorge Dawson prophesied on that occasion, the library in a few years\r\nbecome the finest collection of Shakespearean literature in Europe\r\ntherein being gathered from every land which the poet's fame had\r\nreached, not only the multitudinous editions of his works, but also\r\nevery available scrap of literature bearing thereon, from the massive\r\nfolios and quaint quartoes of the old times to the veriest trifle of\r\ncurrent gossip culled from the columns of the newspapers. Nothing was\r\nconsidered too rare or too unimportant, so long as it had connection\r\neven remote to Shakespeare; and the very room (opened April 23, 1888),\r\nin which the books were stored itself acquired a Shakespearean value in\r\nits carved and elaborately-appropriate fittings. When started, it was\r\nhoped that at least 5,000 volumes would be got together, but that number\r\nwas passed in 1874, and at the end of 1878 there were more than 8,700,\r\nin addition to the books, pictures, documents, and relics connected with\r\nStratford-on-Avon and her gifted son contained in the Staunton\r\ncollection. How all the treasures vanished has already been told. Much\r\nhas been done to replace the library, and many valuable works have been\r\nsecured; but, as the figures last published show, the new library is a\r\nlong way behind as yet. It now contains 4,558 volumes, valued at £1,352\r\n9s. 3d., classified as follows:--English, 2,205 volumes; French, 322;\r\nGerman, 1,639; Bohemian, 14; Danish, 25; Dutch, 68; Finnish, 4; Frisian,\r\n2; Greek, 9; Hebrew, 2; Hungarian, 44; Icelandic, 3; Italian, 94;\r\nPolish, 15; Portuguese, 3; Roumanian, 1; Roumelian, 1; Russian, 56;\r\nSpanish, 18; Swedish, 30; Ukraine, 1; Wallachian, 1; and Welsh, 1.\r\n\r\n~Libraries Suburban.~--The ratepayers of the Manor of Aston adopted the\r\nFree Libraries Act, May 15, 1877, and their Library forms part of the\r\nLocal Board buildings in Witton Road. At the end of March, 1883, the\r\nnumber of volumes in the reference library was 3,216, and the issues\r\nduring the year numbered 8,096. In the lending department the library\r\nconsists of 5,582 volumes, and the total issues during the year were\r\n74,483; giving a daily average of 245. The number of borrowers was\r\n3,669.--Aston and Handsworth being almost part of Birmingham, it would\r\nbe an act of kindness if local gentlemen having duplicates on their\r\nlibrary shelves, would share them between the two.\r\n\r\n_Handsworth_ Free Library was opened at the Local Board Offices, of\r\nwhich building it forms a part, on May 1, 1880, with a collection of\r\nabout 5,000 volumes, which has since been increased to nearly 7,500.\r\nThat the library is appreciated is shown by the fact that during last\r\nyear the issues numbered 42,234 volumes, the borrowers being 514 males\r\nand 561 females.\r\n\r\n_Smethwick_ Free Library and Reading Room was opened Aug. 14, 1880.\r\n\r\n_King's Norton_.--In or about 1680, the Rev. Thomas Hall, B.D., founded\r\na curious old Library for the use of the parishioners, and the books are\r\npreserved in the Grammar School, near the Church. This is the earliest\r\n_free_ library known in the Midlands.\r\n\r\n~Licensed Victuallers' Society.~--See \"_Trade Protection Societies_.\"\r\n\r\n~Licensed Victuallers' Asylum.~--See \"_Philanthropical Institutions_.\"\r\n\r\n~Licensed Victuallers.~--The following table shows the number of\r\nlicensed victuallers, dealers in wine, beer, &c., in the borough as well\r\nas the holders of what are known as outdoor licenses:--\r\n\r\n\r\nYear.

H.\r\nFulford, G. Groves, J. Pearce, D. Moran, G. Williams, R. Foreshaw, and\r\nG. Lempiere, aided by the Mayor and Dr. Miller, raised about £500 as a\r\ncontribution from Birmingham to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.\r\nTwo boats were credited to us in the Society's books, one called\r\n\"Birmingham\" (launched at Soho Pool, November 26, 1864), and the other\r\nthe \"James Pearce.\" These boats, placed on the Lincolnshire and Norfolk\r\ncoasts, were instrumental in the saving of some hundreds of lives, but\r\nboth have, long since, been worn out, and it is about time that\r\nBirmingham replaced them. Messrs. C. and W. Barwell, Pickford Street,\r\nact as local hon. secs. The \"Charles Ingleby\" lifeboat, at Hartlepool,\r\nwas paid for, and the establishment for its maintenance endowed, out of\r\nthe sum of £1,700, contributed by C.P. Wragge, Esq., in memory of the\r\nlate Rev. Charles Ingleby.\r\n\r\n~Lifford,~ in the parish of King's Norton, once boasted of a Monastic\r\nestablishment, which was squelched by Bluff King Harry, the only remains\r\nnow to be found consisting of a few more than half-buried foundations\r\nand watercourses.\r\n\r\n~Lighting.~--Oil lamps for giving light in the streets were in limited\r\nuse here in 1733, even before an Act was obtained to enforce payment of\r\na rate therefor. Deritend and Bordesley obtained light by the Act passed\r\nin 1791. The Street Commissioners, Nov. 8, 1816, advertised for tenders\r\nfor lighting the streets with gas, but it was nearly ten years (April\r\n29, 1826) before the lamps were thus supplied. The Lighting Act was\r\nadopted at Saltley April 1, 1875. Lighting the streets by electricity\r\n_may_ come some day, though, as the Gas Works belong to the town, it\r\nwill, doubtless, be in the days of our grandchildren.\r\n\r\n~Lighting by Electricity.~--After the very successful application of the\r\nelectric light in the Town Hall on the occasion of the Festival in 1882,\r\nit is not surprising that an attempt should be made to give it a more\r\nextended trial. A scheme has been drawn out by the Crompton-Winfield\r\nCompany for this purpose, and it has received the sanction of the Town\r\nCouncil, and been confirmed by the Board of Trade, shopkeepers in the\r\ncentre of the town may soon have a choice of lights for the display of\r\ntheir wares. The area fixed by the scheme is described by the following\r\nboundaries:--Great Charles Street to Congreve Street; Congreve Street to\r\nEdmund Street; Edmund Street to Newhall Street; Newhall Street to\r\nColmore Row; Colmore Row to Bull Street; Bull Street, High Street, New\r\nStreet, Stephenson Place, Paradise Street, and Easy Row. The streets to\r\nbe supplied with electric mains within two years are as follows:--Great\r\nCharles Street (to Congreve Street), Congreve Street, New Street,\r\nStephenson Place, Easy Row, and Paradise Street. The Corporation are to\r\nhave powers of purchasing the undertaking at the end of sixteen years--\r\nthat is, fourteen years after the expiration of the two-years' term\r\nallowed for the experimental lighting of the limited area. The order,\r\nwhile fully protecting the rights of the public and of the Corporation,\r\njustly recognises the experimental character of the project of\r\nelectric-lighting from a common centre, and is much more favourable, in\r\nmany ways, to the promoters than the legislation under which gas\r\nundertakings are conducted. Whether this will tend towards reducing the\r\nprice of gas remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n~Lightning Conductors~ were introduced here in 1765.\r\n\r\n~Lindon.~--The Minerva, in Peck Lane, was, circa 1835, kept by \"Joe\r\nLindon,\" a host as popular then as our modern \"Joe Hillman,\" up at \"The\r\nStores,\" in Paradise Street.\r\n\r\n~Literary Associations.~--The Central Literary Association first met\r\nNov. 28, 1856. The Moseley and Balsall Heath, Oct. 11, 1877.\r\n\r\n~Livery Street.~--So called from the Livery stables once there, opposite\r\nBrittle street, which is now covered by the Great Western Railway\r\nStation.\r\n\r\n~Livingstone.~--Dr. Livingstone, the African traveller, delivered an\r\naddress in the Town Hall, October 23, 1857.\r\n\r\n~Loans.~--According to the Registrar-General's late report, there were\r\n380 loan societies in the kingdom, who had among them a capital of\r\n£122,160, the members of the said societies numbering 33,520, giving an\r\naverage lending capital of £3 12s. 10-1/2d. each. That is certainly not\r\na very large sum to invest in the money market, and it is to be hoped\r\nthat the score or two of local societies can show better funds. What the\r\nprofits of this business are frequently appear in the reports taken at\r\nPolice Courts and County Courts, where Mr. Cent.-per-Cent. now and then\r\nbashfully acknowledges that he is sometimes satisfied with a profit of\r\n200 per cent. There _are_ respectable offices in Birmingham where loans\r\ncan be obtained at a fair and reasonable rate, but _Punch's_ advice to\r\nthose about to marry may well be given in the generality of cases, to\r\nanyone thinking of visiting a loan office. Young men starting in\r\nbusiness may, under certain conditions, obtain help for that purpose\r\nfrom the \"Dudley Trust.\"--See \"_Philanthropical Trusts_.\"\r\n\r\n~Loans, Public.~--England, with its National Debt of £776,000,000, is\r\nabout the richest country in the world, and if the amount of\r\nindebtedness is the sign of prosperity, Birmingham must be tolerably\r\nwell off. Up to the end of 1882 our little loan account stood thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Borrowd   Repaid     Owing.\r\nBaths ..  ..  ..  ..    £62,425  £27,743    £34,682\r\nCemetery  ..  ..  ..     46,500   19,316     27,184\r\nClosed Burial Gr'nds     10,000       41      9,959\r\nCouncil House ..  ..    135,762   10,208    125,554\r\nFire Brigade Station      6,000       53      5,947\r\nFree Libraries..  ..     56,050    7,534     48,516\r\nGaol  ..  ..  ..  ..     92,350   79,425     12,925\r\nIndustrial School ..     13,710    2,310     11,400\r\nAsylum, Winson Gn...    100,000   97,020      2,980\r\n  \"    Rubery Hill..    100,012    5,887     94,125\r\nMarkt Hall & Markts     186,942   73,463    113,479\r\nMortuaries..  ..  ..        700      103        597\r\nParks ..  ..  ..  ..     63,210   12,347     50,863\r\nPaving roads  ..  ..    158,100   30,088    128,012\r\nPaving footways   ..     79,950    8,113     71,837\r\nPolice Stations   ..     25,231    9,839     15,392\r\nPublic Office ..  ..     23,400   14,285      9,115\r\nSewers & Sewerage ..    366,235   81,338    284,897\r\nTramways  ..  ..  ..     65,450   17,125     48,325\r\nTown Hall ..  ..  ..     69,521   37,885     31,636\r\nTown Improvements ..    348,680  134,156    214,524\r\n                     ------------------------------\r\n                      2,010,227  668,278  1,341,949\r\nImprovem't scheme ..  1,534,731   31,987  1,502,744\r\nGasworks  ..  ..  ..  2,184,186  142,359  2,041,827\r\nWaterworks..  ..  ..  1,814,792    5,086  1,809,706\r\n                     -----------------------------\r\nTotals..  ..  ..  ..  7,543,936  847,710  6,696,226\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above large total, however, does not show all that was owing. The\r\nUnited Drainage Board have borrowed £386,806, and as Birmingham pays\r\n£24,722 out of the year's expenditure of £33,277 of that Board, rather\r\nmore than seven-tenths of that debt must be added to the Borough\r\naccount, say £270,000. The Board of Guardians have, between June, 1869,\r\nand January, 1883, borrowed on loan £130,093, and during same period\r\nhave repaid £14,808, leaving £115,285 due by them, which must also be\r\nadded to the list of the town's debts.\r\n\r\n~Local Acts.~--There have been a sufficient number of specially-local\r\nActs of Parliament passed in connection with this town to fill a law\r\nlibrary of considerable size. Statutes, clauses, sections, and orders\r\nhave followed in rapid succession for the last generation or two. Our\r\nforefathers were satisfied and gratified if they got a regal of\r\nparliamentary notice of this kind once in a century, but no sooner did\r\nthe inhabitants find themselves under a \"properly-constituted\" body of\r\n\"head men,\" than the lawyers' game began. First a law must be got to\r\nmake a street, another to light it, a third to pave it, and then one to\r\nkeep it clean. It is a narrow street, and an Act must be obtained to\r\nwiden it; when widened some wiseacre thinks a market should be held in\r\nit, and a law is got for that, and for gathering tolls; after a bit,\r\nanother is required to remove the market, and then the street must be\r\n\"improved,\" and somebody receives more pounds per yard than he gave\r\npence for the bit of ground wanted to round off the corners; and so the\r\nBirmingham world wagged on until the town became a big town, and could\r\nafford to have a big Town Hall when other big towns couldn't, and a\r\ncovered Market Hall and a Smithfield of good size, while other places\r\ndwelt under bare skies. The Act by which the authority of the Street\r\nCommissioners and Highway Surveyors was transferred to the Corporation\r\nwas passed in 1851; the expenses of obtaining it reaching nearly £9,000.\r\nIt took effect on New Year's Day following, and the Commissioners were\r\nno longer \"one of the powers that be,\" but some of the Commissioners'\r\nbonds are effective still. Since that date there have been twenty local\r\nstatutes and orders relating to the borough of Birmingham, from the\r\nBirmingham Improvement Act, 1851, to the Provisional Order Confirmation\r\nAct, passed in 1882, the twenty containing a thousand or more sections.\r\nAll this, however, has recently been altered, the powers that are now\r\nhaving (through the Town Clerk, Mr. Orford Smith) rolled all the old\r\nActs into one, eliminating useless and obsolete clauses, and inserting\r\nothers necessitated by our high state of advanced civilisation. The new\r\nAct, which is known as the Birmingham Corporation Consolidation Act,\r\ncame into force January 1, 1884, and all who desire to master our local\r\ngoverning laws easily and completely had better procure a copy of the\r\nbook containing it, with notes of all the included statutes, compiled by\r\nthe Town Clerk, and published by Messrs. Cornish, New Street.\r\n\r\n~Local Epitaphs.~--Baskerville, when young, was a stone cutter, and it\r\nwas known that there was a gravestone in Handsworth churchyard and\r\nanother in Edgbaston churchyard which were cut by him. The latter was\r\naccidentally broken many years back, but was moved and kept as a\r\ncuriosity until it mysteriously vanished while some repairs were being\r\ndone at the church. It is believed that Baskerville wrote as well as\r\ncarved the inscription which commemorated the death of Edward Richards\r\nwho was an idiot, and died Sept. 21st, 1728, and that it ran thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"If innocents are the fav'rites of heaven,\r\n  And God but little asks where little's given,\r\n  My great Creator has for me in store\r\n  Eternal joys--What wise man can ask more?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gravestone at Handsworth was \"under the chancel window,\" sixty years\r\nago, overgrown with moss and weeds, but inscription and stone have long\r\nsince gone. Baskerville's own epitaph, on the Mausoleum in his grounds\r\nat Easy Hill, has often been quoted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    'Stranger,\r\n  Beneath this cone, in unconsecrated ground,\r\n  A friend to the liberties of mankind directed his body to be inurned.\r\n  May the example contribute to emancipate thy mind\r\n  From the idle fears of Superstition,\r\n  And the wicked Act of Priesthood!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost as historical as the above, is the inscription on the tombstone\r\nerected over Mary Ashford, at Sutton Coldfield:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  As a Warning to Female Virtue,\r\n  And a humble Monument of Female Chastity,\r\n  This Stone marks the Grave\r\n  of\r\n  MARY ASHFORD,\r\n  Who, in the 20th year of her age,\r\n  Having incautiously repaired\r\n  To a scene of amusement\r\n  Without proper protection,\r\n  Was brutally violated and murdered,\r\n  On the 27th May, 1817.\r\n\r\n  Lovely and chaste as is the primrose pale,\r\n  Rifled of virgin sweetness by the gale,\r\n  Mary! The wretch who thee remorseless slew,\r\n  Will surely God's avenging wrath pursue.\r\n\r\n  For, though the deed of blood be veiled in night,\r\n  \"Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?\"\r\n  Fair, blighted flower! The muse, that weeps thy doom,\r\n  Rears o'er thy sleeping dust this warning tomb!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following quaint inscription appears on the tombstone erected in\r\nmemory of John Dowler, the blacksmith, in Aston churchyard:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sacred to the Memory of\r\n  JOHN DOWLER,\r\n  Late of Castle Bromwich, who\r\n  Departed this life December 6th, 1787,\r\n  Aged 42,\r\n  Also two of his Sons, JAMES and CHARLES,\r\n  Who died infants.\r\n\r\n\r\n  My sledge and hammer lie reclined,\r\n  My bellows, too, have lost their wind\r\n  My fire's extinct, my forge decayed,\r\n  And in the dust my vice is laid;\r\n  My coal is spent, my iron gone,\r\n  My nails are drove, my work is done.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the above, like the next four, has appeared in many\r\nparts of the country, as well as in the local burial grounds, from which\r\nthey have been copied:--\r\n\r\nFrom St. Bartholomew's:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The bitter cup that death gave me\r\n  Is passing round to come to thee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom General Cemetery:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Life is a city full of crooked streets,\r\n  Death is the market-place where all men meets;\r\n  If life were merchandise which men could buy,\r\n  The rich would only live, the poor would die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Witton Cemetery:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"O earth, O earth! observe this well--\r\n  That earth to earth shall come to dwell;\r\n  Then earth in earth shall close remain,\r\n  Till earth from earth shall rise again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom St. Philip's:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, cruel death, how could you be so unkind\r\n  To take him before, and leave me behind?\r\n  You should have taken both of us, if either,\r\n  Which would have been more pleasing to the survivor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next, upon an infant, is superior to the general run of this class\r\nof inscription. It was copied from a slab intended to be placed in Old\r\nEdgbaston Churchyard:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Beneath this stone, in sweet repose,\r\n    Is laid a mother's dearest pride;\r\n  A flower that scarce had waked to life,\r\n    And light and beauty, ere it died.\r\n  God and His wisdom has recalled\r\n    The precious boon His love has given;\r\n  And though the casket moulders here,\r\n    The gem is sparkling now in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRamblers may find many quaint epitaphs in neighbouring village\r\nchurchyards. In Shustoke churchyard, or rather on a tablet placed\r\nagainst the wall of the church over the tomb of a person named Hautbach,\r\nthe date on which is 1712, there is an inscription, remarkable not only\r\nfor lines almost identical with those over Shakespeare's grave, but for\r\ncombining several other favourite specimens of graveological literature,\r\nas here bracketed:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"When Death shall cut the thread of life,\r\n  Both of Mee and my living Wife,\r\n  When please God our change shall bee,\r\n  There is a Tomb for Mee and Shee,\r\n  Wee freely shall resign up all\r\n  To Him who gave, and us doth call.\r\n\r\n  {Sleep here wee must, both in the Dust,\r\n  {Till the Resurrection of the Just.\r\n\r\n  {Good friend, within these Railes forbear\r\n  {To dig the dust enclosed here.\r\n  {Blest bee the man who spares these stones\r\n  {And Curst be he that moves our bones.\r\n\r\n  {Whilst living here, learn how to die;\r\n  {This benefit thoul't reap thereby:\r\n  {Neither the life or death will bee\r\n  {Grievous or sad, but joy to thee.\r\n\r\n  {Watch thoue, and pray; thy time well spend;\r\n  {Unknown is the hour of thy end.\r\n\r\n  {As thou art, so once were wee,\r\n  {As wee are, so must thou bee,\r\n    Dumspiramus Speramus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a collection of epitaphs in itself, even to the last line, which\r\nis to be found in Durham Cathedral on a \"brass\" before the altar.\r\n\r\n~Local Landowners.~--It is somewhat a difficult matter to tell how much\r\nof the ground on which the town is built belongs to any one particular\r\nperson, even with the assistance of the \"Returns\" obtained by John\r\nBright of \"the owner\" of land so called, possessing estimated yearly\r\nrentals of £1,000 and upwards. That these \"Returns\" may be useful to\r\nbiassed politicians is likely enough, as Lord Calthorpe is put down as\r\nowner of 2,073 acres at an estimated rental of £113,707, while Mr. Muntz\r\nappears as owning 2,486 acres at an estimated rental of £3,948. His\r\nlordship's £113,707 \"estimated\" rental must be considerably reduced when\r\nthe leaseholders have taken their share and left him only the ground\r\nrents. The other large ground landlords are the Trustees of the Grammar\r\nSchool, the Trustees of the Colmore, Gooch, Vyse, Inge, Digby, Gillot,\r\nRobins, and Mason estates, &c., Earl Howe, Lench's Trust, the Blue Coat\r\nSchool, &c. The Corporation of Birmingham is returned as owning 257\r\nacres, in addition to 134 had from the Waterworks Co., but that does not\r\ninclude the additions made under the Improvement Scheme, &c. The manner\r\nin which the estates of the old Lords of the Manor, of the Guild of Holy\r\nCross, and the possessions of the ancient Priory, have been divided and\r\nportioned out by descent, marriage, forfeiture, plunder, and purchase is\r\ninteresting matter of history, but rather of a private than public\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n~Local Notes and Queries.~--The gathering of odd scraps of past local\r\nhistory, notes of men and manners of a bygone time, and the stray (and\r\nsometimes strange) bits of folklore garnered alone in the recollections\r\nof greybeards, has been an interesting occupation for more than one\r\nduring the past score or two of years. The first series of \"Local Notes\r\nand Queries\" in our newspapers appeared in the _Gazette_, commencing in\r\nFeb., 1856, and was continued till Sept., 1860. There was a somewhat\r\nsimilar but short series running in the columns of the _Journal_ from\r\nAugust, 1861, to May, 1862. The _Daily Post_ took it up in Jan., 1863,\r\nand devoted a column per week to \"Notes\" up to March, 1865, resuming at\r\nintervals from 1867 to 1872. The series now (1884) appearing in the\r\n_Weekly Post_ was commenced on the first Saturday (Jan. 6) in 1877.\r\n\r\n~Local Taxation.~--See \"_Municipal Expenditure_.\"\r\n\r\n~Locks.~--The making of locks must have been one of the earliest of our\r\nlocal trades, as we read of one at Throckmorton of very quaint design,\r\nbut rare workmanship, with the name thereon of \"Johannes Wilkes,\r\nBirmingham,\" towards the end of the 17th century. In 1824 there were 186\r\nlocksmiths named in the Directory.\r\n\r\n~Lodger Franchise.~--Considering the vast amount of interest taken in\r\nall matters connected with local Parliamentary representation, and the\r\nperiodical battles of bile and banter earned on in the Revision Courts\r\nover the lists of voters, it is somewhat curious to note how little\r\nadvantage has been taken of the clause in the last Reform Bill which\r\ngives the right of voting to lodgers. The qualification required is\r\nsimply the exclusive occupation of lodgings which, if let unfurnished,\r\nare of the clear yearly value of £10; and there must be many hundreds of\r\ngentlemen in the borough residing in apartments who would come under\r\nthis head. Out of a total of 63,221 electors in 1883 there were only 72\r\nwho had claimed their right to vote. In many other boroughs the same\r\ndiscrepancy exists, though here and there the political wire-pullers\r\nhave evidently seen how to use the lodger franchise to much better\r\neffect, as in the case of Worcester for instance, where there are 59\r\nlodger voters out of a total of 6,362.--See \"_Parliamentary Elections_.\"\r\n\r\n~London 'Prentice Street,~ was called Western Street or Westley's Row on\r\nthe old maps, its continuation, the Coach Yard, being then Pemberton's\r\nYard. How the name of London 'Prentice Street came to be given to the\r\ndelectable thoroughfare is one of \"those things no fellow can\r\nunderstand.\" At one time there was a schoolroom there, the boys being\r\ntaught good manners upstairs, while they could learn lessons of\r\ndepravity below. With the anxious desire of putting the best face on\r\neverything that characterises the present local \"fathers of the people,\"\r\nthe London 'Prentice has been sent to the right-about, and the nasty\r\ndirty stinking thoroughfare is now called \"Dalton Street.\"\r\n\r\n~Loveday Street,~ from Loveday Croft, a field given in Good Queen Bess's\r\nreign, by John Cooper, as a trysting-place for the Brummagem lads and\r\nlasses when on wooing bent.\r\n\r\n~Low Rents.~--A return of unassessed houses in the parish of Birmingham,\r\ntaken October 19, 1790, showed 2,000 at a rental under £5, 2,000 others\r\nunder £6, 3,000 under £7, 2,000 under £8, 500 under £9, and 500 under\r\n£10.\r\n\r\n~Lozells.~--In the lease of a farm of 138 acres, sold by auction, June\r\n24, 1793, it was written \"Lowcells.\" Possibly the name is derived from\r\nthe Saxon \"lowe\" (hill) and \"cele\" (cold or chill) making it \"the cold\r\nhill.\"\r\n\r\n~Lunacy.~--Whether it arises from political heat, religious ecstacies,\r\nintemperance, or the cares and worry of the universal hunt for wealth,\r\nit is certainly a painful fact to chronicle that in proportion to\r\npopulation insanity is far more prevalent now than it was fifty years\r\nago, and Birmingham has no more share in such excess than other parts of\r\nthe kingdom. Possibly, the figures show more prominently from the action\r\nof the wise rules that enforce the gathering of the insane into public\r\ninstitutions, instead of leaving the unfortunates to the care (or\r\ncarelessness) of their relatives as in past days, when the wards of the\r\npoor-houses were the only receptacles for those who had no relatives to\r\nshelter them. The erection of the Borough Asylum, at Winson Green, was\r\ncommenced in 1846, and it was finished in 1851. The house and grounds\r\ncovered an area of about twenty acres, the building being arranged to\r\naccommodate 330 patients. Great as this number appeared to be, not many\r\nyears passed before the necessity of enlargement was perceived, and,\r\nultimately, it became evident the Winson Green establishment must either\r\nbe doubled in size or that a second Asylum must be erected on another\r\nsite. An estate of 150 acres on the south-eastern slopes of Rubery Hill,\r\non the right-hand side of the turnpike road from here to Bromsgrove, was\r\npurchased by the Corporation, and a new Asylum, which will accommodate\r\n616 patients, has there been erected. For the house and its immediate\r\ngrounds, 70 acres have been apportioned, the remainder being kept for\r\nthe purposes of a farm, where those of the inmates fit for work can be\r\nemployed, and where the sewage from the asylum will be utilised. The\r\ncost of the land was £6,576 8s. 5d., and that of the buildings, the\r\nfurnishing, and the laying out of the grounds, £133,495 5s. 8d. The\r\nreport of the Lunatic Asylums Committee for 1882 stated that the number\r\nof patients, including those boarded under contract at other asylums, on\r\nthe first of Jan., 1882, was 839. There were admitted to Winson Green\r\nand Rubery Hill during the year 349. There were discharged during the\r\nyear 94, and there died 124, leaving, on the 31st Dec., 970. The whole\r\nof the 970 were then at the borough asylums, and were chargeable as\r\nfollows:--To Birmingham parish, 644; to Birmingham borough, 8; to Aston\r\nUnion, in the borough, 168; to King's Norton, 16; to other unions under\r\ncontract, 98; the remaining 36 patients not being paupers. The income of\r\nthe asylums for the year was--from Birmingham patients £20,748 1s. 9.;\r\nfrom pauper patients under contract, and from patients not paupers,\r\n£2,989 9s. 5d.; from goods sold, £680 1s. 5d.; total, £24,417 12s. 7d.\r\nThe expenditure on maintenance account was £21,964 4s., and on building\r\ncapital account £2,966 7s. 7d.--total, £24,915 11s. 7d.; showing a\r\nbalance against the asylums of £497 19s. The nett average weekly cost\r\nfor the year was 9s. 6-1/2d. per head. Mr. E.B. Whitcombe, medical\r\nsuperintendent at Winson Green, says that among the causes of insanity\r\nin those admitted it is satisfactory to note a large decrease in the\r\nnumber from intemperance, the percentage for the year being 7.7, as\r\ncompared with 18 and 21 per cent. in 1881 and 1880 respectively. The\r\nproportion of recoveries to admissions was in the males 27.7, in the\r\nfemales 36, and in the total 32.3 percent. This is below the average,\r\nand is due to a large number of chronic and unfavourable cases admitted.\r\nAt Rubery Hill Asylum, Dr. Lyle reports that out of the first 450\r\nadmissions there were six patients discharged as recovered.--The Midland\r\nCounties' Idiot Asylum, at Knowle, opened in 1867, also finds shelter\r\nfor some of Birmingham's unfortunate children. The Asylum provides a\r\nhome for about 50, but it is in contemplation to considerably enlarge\r\nit. At the end of 1882 there were 28 males and 21 females, 47 being the\r\naverage number of inmates during the year, the cost per head being £41\r\n13s. 6d. Of the limited number of inmates in the institution no fewer\r\nthan thirteen came from Birmingham, and altogether as many as\r\nthirty-five candidates had been elected from Birmingham. The income from\r\nall sources, exclusive of contributions to the building fund, amounted\r\nto £2,033 3s. 8d., and the total expenditure (including £193 3s. 4d.\r\nwritten off for depreciation of buildings) to £1,763 15s. 7d., leaving a\r\nbalance in hand of £269 8s. 1d. The fund which is being raised for the\r\nenlargement of the institution then amounted to £605 15s., the sum\r\nrequired being £5,000. The society's capital was then £10,850 12s. 8d.\r\nof which £7,358 12s. 5d. had been laid out in lands and buildings. Mr.\r\nTait, the medical officer, was of opinion that one-fourth of the\r\nchildren were capable of becoming productive workers under kindly\r\ndirection and supervision, the progress made by some of the boys in\r\nbasket-making being very marked.\r\n\r\n~Lunar Society.~--So called from the meetings being held at the full of\r\nthe moon that the members might have light nights to drive home, but\r\nfrom which they were nicknamed \"the lunatics.\" Originally commenced\r\nabout 1765, it included among its members Baskerville, Boulton, Watt,\r\nPriestley, Thomas Day, Samuel Galton, R.L. Edgeworth, Dr. Withering, Dr.\r\nSmall, Dr. Darwin, Wedgwood, Keir, and indeed almost every man of\r\nintellectual note of the time. It died down as death took the leaders,\r\nbut it may be said to have left traces in many learned societies of\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\n~Luncheon Bars.~--The honour of introducing the modern style of luncheon\r\nbar must be awarded to the landlord of the Acorn, in Temple Street, who,\r\nhaving seen something of the kind in one of the Channel Islands,\r\nimported the notion to Birmingham. The lumber rooms and stables at back\r\nof his house were cleared and fitted up as smoke rooms, and bread and\r\ncheese, and beer, &c., dealt out over the counter. Here it was that Mr.\r\nHillman took his degree as popular waiter, and from the Acorn also he\r\ntook a wife to help him start \"The Stores,\" in Paradise Street. Mr.\r\nThomas Hanson was not long behind Hillman before he opened up \"The\r\nCorner Stores,\" in Union Passage, following that with the \"St. James\" in\r\nNew Street, and several others in various parts of the town. The \"Bars\"\r\nare now an \"institution\" that has become absolutely indispensable, even\r\nfor the class who prefer the semi-privacy of the \"Restaurants,\" as the\r\nproprietors of the more select Bars like to call their establishments.\r\n\r\n~Magistrates.~--By direction of the Queen's Council, in 1569, all\r\nmagistrates had to send up \"bonds\" that they would subscribe to the then\r\nrecently passed Act for the Uniformity of Common Prayers and Services in\r\nthe Church, and the Administration of the Sacraments. The local name of\r\nMiddlemore appears among the few in this county who objected to do so,\r\nand most likely his descendants would do the same. The first twenty-five\r\nof our borough magistrates were appointed about nine weeks after the\r\ndate of the Charter of Incorporation, 1839. In 1841, 1849, 1856, and\r\n1859, other gentlemen were placed on the roll, and in April, 1880, ten\r\nmore names were added to the list, having been sent up to the Lord\r\nChancellor a few days before he vacated office, by some knowing\r\ngentlemen who had conceived a notion that the Conservative element was\r\nhardly strong enough among the occupants of the Bench. There are now 52,\r\nin addition to the Stipendiary Magistrate and the Recorder, and as\r\npolitics _must_ enter into every matter connected with public life in\r\nBirmingham, we record the interesting fact that 31 of these gentlemen\r\nare Liberals and 21 Conservatives. Mr. T.C.S. Kynnersley first acted as\r\nStipendiary, April 19, 1856.\r\n\r\n~Magazines.~--See \"_Newspapers and Periodicals_.\"\r\n\r\n~Manor House.~--How few of the thousands who pass Smithfield every day\r\nknow that they are treading upon ground where once the Barons of\r\nBirmingham kept house in feudal grandeur. Whether the ancient Castle,\r\ndestroyed in the time of Stephen, pre-occupied the site of the Manor\r\nHouse (or, as it was of late years called--the Moat House), is more than\r\nantiquarians have yet found out, any more than they can tell us when the\r\nlatter building was erected, or when it was demolished. Hutton says:\r\n\"The first certain account we meet of the moat (which surrounded the\r\nisland on which the erections were built) is in the reign of Henry the\r\nSecond, 1154, when Peter de Bermingham, then lord of the fee, had a\r\ncastle here, and lived in splendour. All the succeeding lords resided\r\nupon the same island till their cruel expulsion by John, Duke of\r\nNorthumberland, in 1537. The old castle followed its lords, and is\r\nburied in the ruins of time. Upon the spot, about fifty years ago\r\n[1730], rose a house in the modern style, occupied by a manufacturer\r\n(Thomas Francis); in one of the outbuildings is shown the apartment\r\nwhere the ancient lords kept their court leet. The trench being filled\r\nwith water has nearly the same appearance now as perhaps a thousand\r\nyears ago; but not altogether the same use. It then served to protect\r\nits master, but now to turn a thread mill.\" Moat Lane and Mill Lane are\r\nthe only names by which the memory of the old house is now retained. The\r\nthread mill spoken of by Hutton gave place to a brass or iron foundry,\r\nand the property being purchased by the Commissioners, the whole was\r\ncleared off the ground in 1815 or 1816, the sale of the building\r\nmaterials, &c., taking place July 5, 1815. Among the \"lots\" sold, the\r\nMoat House and offices adjoining realised £290; the large gates at the\r\nentrance with the brick pillars, £16; the bridge, £11; the timber trees,\r\n£25; a fire engine with carriage, &c., £6 15s. (possibly some sort of\r\nsteam engine, then called fire engines); the total produce, including\r\ncounting-house, warehouse, casting, tinning, burnishing, blacking, and\r\nblacksmiths' shops, a horse mill, scouring mill, and a quantity of wood\r\nsheds and palisading, amounted to nearly £1,150. The prosaic minds of\r\nthe Commissioners evidently did not lead them to value \"the apartments\r\nwhere the ancient lords kept their court,\" or it had been turned into a\r\nscouring or tinning shop, for no mention was made of it in the catalogue\r\nof sale, and as the old Castle disappeared, so did the Manor House,\r\nleaving not a stone behind. Mr. William Hamper took a sketch of the old\r\nhouse, in May, 1814, and he then wrote of the oldest part of the\r\nbuilding, that it was \"half-timbered,\" and seemingly of about Henry\r\nVIII.'s time, or perhaps a little later, but some of the timbers had\r\nevidently been used in a former building (probably the old Manorial\r\nresidence) as the old mortices were to be seen in several of the beams\r\nand uprights. The house itself was cleared away in May, 1816, and the\r\nlast of the outbuildings in the following month. So perfect was the\r\nclearance, that not even any of the foundations have been turned up\r\nduring the alterations lately effected in Smithfield Market. In 1746,\r\nthe \"manorial rights\" were purchased by Thomas Archer, of Umberslade,\r\nfrom whose descendants they were acquired by the Commissioners, in 1812,\r\nunder an Act of Parliament obtained for the purpose, the price given for\r\nthe Manor House, meat, and ground, being £5,672, in addition to £12,500,\r\nfor \"market tolls,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Manufactures.~--For a few notes respecting the manufactures carried on\r\nin Birmingham, see \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Maps of Birmingham.~--Westley's \"Plan of Birmingham, surveyed in the\r\nyear 1731,\" is the earliest published map yet met with; Bradford's in\r\n1750, is the next. Hanson's of 1778, was reduced for Hutton's work, in\r\n1781. For the third edition, 1792, Pye's map was used, and it was added\r\nto in 1795. 1800 saw Bissett's \"Magnificent Directory\" published, with a\r\nmap; and in 1815 Kempson's survey was taken, and, as well as Pye's, was\r\nseveral times issued with slight alterations, as required. In 1825,\r\nPigott Smith's valuable map, with names of landowners (and a miniature\r\ncopy of Westley's in upper left-hand corner), was issued, and for many\r\nyears it was the most reliable authority that could be referred to. 1834\r\nwas prolific in maps; Arrowsmith's, Wrightson and Webb's, Guest's, and\r\nHunt's, appearing, the best of them being the first-named. The Useful\r\nKnowledge Society's map, with views of public buildings, was issued in\r\n1844, and again in 1849. In 1848, Fowler and Son published a\r\nfinely-engraved map, 68-1/4in. by 50-1/2in., of the parish of Aston,\r\nwith the Duddeston-cum-Nechells, Deritend, and Bordesley wards, and the\r\nhamlets of Erdington, Castle Bromwich, Little Bromwich, Saltley, and\r\nWashwood Heath, Water Orton, and Witton. The Board of Health map was\r\nissued in 1849; Guest's reissued in 1850; Blood's \"ten-mile map\" in\r\n1853; and the Post-office Directory map in 1854. In the next year, the\r\nTown Council street map (by Pigott Smith) was published, followed by\r\nMoody's in 1858, Cornish's and Granger's in 1860, and also a corrected\r\nand enlarged edition of the Post-office Directory map. A variety, though\r\nmostly of the nature of street maps, have appeared since then, the\r\nlatest, most useful, and correct (being brought down to the latest date)\r\nbeing that issued to their friends, mounted for use, by Messrs. Walter\r\nShowell and Sons, at whose head offices in Great Charles Street copies\r\ncan be obtained.--In 1882 the Corporation reproduced and issued a series\r\nof ancient and hitherto private maps of the town and neighbourhood,\r\nwhich are of great value to the historian and everyone interested in the\r\nland on which Birmingham and its suburbs are built. The first of these\r\nmaps in point of date is that of the Manor of Edgbaston 1718, followed\r\nby that of the Manor of Aston 1758, Little Bromwich Manor 1759,\r\nBordesley Manor 1760, Saltley Manor 1760, Duddeston and Nechells Manors\r\n1778, and of Birmingham parish 1779. The last-named was the work of a\r\nlocal surveyor, John Snape, and it is said that he used a camera obscura\r\nof his own construction to enable him to make his work so perfect that\r\nit served as correct guide to the map makers for fifty years after.\r\n\r\n~Markets.~--Some writers have dated the existence of Birmingham as a\r\nmarket town as being prior to the Norman Conquest, charters (they say)\r\nfor the holding of markets having been granted by both Saxon and Danish\r\nKings. That market was held here at an early period is evident from the\r\nfact of the charter therefore being renewed by Richard I., who visited\r\nthe De Berminghams in 1189. The market day has never been changed from\r\nThursday, though Tuesday and Saturday besides are now not enough; in\r\nfact, every day may be called market day, though Thursday attracts more\r\nof our friends from the country. The opening of Smithfield (May 29,\r\n1817) was the means of concentrating the markets for horses, pigs,\r\ncattle, sheep, and farm produce, which for years previously had been\r\noffered for sale in New Street, Ann Street, High Street, and Dale End.\r\nThe Market tolls, for which £12,500 was paid in 1812, produced £5,706\r\n10s. 5d. in the year 1840.\r\n\r\n_Cattle Market_.--Prior to 1769 cattle were sold in High Street; in that\r\nyear their standings were removed to Dale End, and in 1776 (Oct. 28.) to\r\nDeritend. Pigs and sheep were sold in New Street up to the opening of\r\nSmithfield. Some five-and-twenty years back a movement was set on foot\r\nfor the removal of the Cattle Market to the Old Vauxhall neighbourhood,\r\nbut the cost frightened the people, and the project was shelved. The\r\n\"town improvers\" of to-day, who play with thousands of pounds as\r\nchildren used to do at chuck-farthing, are not so easily baulked, and\r\nthe taxpayers will doubtless soon have to find the cash for a very much\r\nlarger Cattle Market in some other part of the borough. A site has been\r\nfixed upon in Rupert Street by the \"lords in Convention,\" but up to now\r\n(March, 1885), the question is not _quite_ settled.\r\n\r\n_Corn Market_.--The ancient market for corn, or \"Corn Cheaping,\" formed,\r\npart of \"le Bul ryng\" which at one time was almost the sole place of\r\ntraffic of our forefathers. At first an open space, as the market\r\ngranted by the early Norman Kings grew in extent, the custom arose of\r\nsetting up stalls, the right to do which was doubtless bought of the\r\nLords of the Manor. These grew into permanent tenements, and stallages,\r\n\"freeboards,\" shambles, and even houses (some with small gardens\r\nabutting on the unfenced churchyard), gradually covered the whole\r\nground, and it ultimately cost the town a large sum to clear it, the\r\nCommissioners, in 1806-7, paying nearly £25,000 for the purpose. The\r\nfarmers of a hundred years ago used to assemble with their samples of\r\ngrain round the Old Cross, or High Cross, standing nearly opposite the\r\npresent Market Hall steps, and in times of scarcity, when bread was\r\ndear, they needed the protection of special constables.\r\n\r\n_Fish Market_.--In April, 1851, the fishmongers' stalls were removed\r\nfrom Dale End, and the sale was confined to the Market Hall, but\r\nconsequent on the increase of population, and therefore of consumption,\r\na separate market, at corner of Bell Street, was opened in 1870, and\r\nthat is now being enlarged.\r\n\r\n_Hide and Skin Market_.--The sale of these not particularly\r\nsweet-smelling animal products was formerly carried on in the open at\r\nSmithfield, but a special market for them and for tallow was opened May\r\n25, 1850; the same building being utilised as a wool market July 29,\r\n1851.\r\n\r\n_Vegetable Market_, so long held in the Bull Ring, is now principally\r\nheld in the covered portion of Smithfield, which promises to be soon a\r\nhuge wholesale market.\r\n\r\n~Marriages.~--This is the style in which these interesting events used\r\nto chronicled:--\r\n\r\n\"Sept. 30, 1751. On Monday last, the Rev. Mr. Willes, a relation of the\r\nLord Chief Justice Willes, was married to Miss Wilkins, daughter of an\r\neminent grocer of this town, a young lady of great merit, and handsome\r\nfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nov. 23, 1751. On Tuesday last, was married at St. Mary-le-Bow, in\r\nCheapside, Mr. W. Welch, an eminent hardware man of Birmingham, to Miss\r\nNancy Morton, of Sheffield, an agreeable young lady, with a handsome\r\nfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"June 4, 1772 (and not before as mentioned by mistake) at St. Philip's\r\nChurch in this town, Mr. Thomas Smallwood, an eminent wine merchant, to\r\nMiss Harris, a young lady of distinguished accomplishments, with a\r\nfortune of £1,500.\"\r\n\r\n~Masshouse Lane.~--Takes its name from the Roman Catholic Church (or\r\nMass House, as such edifices were then called) erected in 1687, and\r\ndedicated to St. Mary Magdalen and St. Francis. The foundation stone was\r\nlaid March 23, in the above year, and on 16th August, 1688, the first\r\nstone of a Franciscan Convent was laid adjoining to the Church, which\r\nlatter was consecrated Sept. 4. The Church was 95ft long by 33ft. wide,\r\nand towards the building of it and the Convent, James II. gave 125 \"tuns\r\nof timber,\" which were sold for £180; Sir John Gage gave timber valued\r\nat £140; the Dowager Queen Catherine gave £10 15s.; and a Mrs. Anne\r\nGregg, £250. This would appear to have been the first place of worship\r\nput up here by the Romish Church since the time of Henry VIII., and it\r\nwas not allowed to stand long, for the Church and what part of the\r\nConvent was built (in the words of the Franciscan priest who laid the\r\nfirst stone) \"was first defaced, and most of it burrent within to near\r\nye vallue of 400lb., by ye Lord Dellamer's order upon ye 26 of November,\r\n1688, and ye day sevennight following ye rabble of Birmingham begon to\r\npul ye Church and Convent down, and saesed not until they had pulled up\r\nye fundations. They sold ye materials, of which many houses and parts of\r\nhouses are built in ye town of Birmingham, ye townsmen of ye better sort\r\nnot resisting ye rabble, but quietly permitting, if not prompting them\r\nto doe itt.\" The poor priests found shelter at Harborne, where there is\r\nanother Masshouse Lane, their \"Masshouse\" being a little further on in\r\nPritchett's Lane, where for nearly a century the double work of\r\nconducting a school and ministering to their scattered Catholic flock\r\nwas carried on, the next local place of worship built here being \"St.\r\nPeters's Chapel,\" off Broad Street, erected about 1786. It is believed\r\nthat St. Bartholomew's Church covers the site of the short-lived \"Mass\r\nHouse.\"\r\n\r\n~Masonic.~--That the Freemasons are many among us is proved by the\r\nnumber of their Lodges, but the writer has no record throwing light on\r\ntheir past local history, though mention is found now and then in old\r\nnewspapers of their taking part in the ceremonies attending the erection\r\nof more than one of our public buildings. Of their local acts of\r\nbenevolence they sayeth naught, though, as is well-known, their charity\r\nis never found wanting. The three Masonic charitable institutions which\r\nare supported by the voluntary contributions of the craft during 1883\r\nrealised a total income of £55,994 14s. 3d. Of this sum the boys' school\r\nreceived £24,895 7s. 1d.; the Benevolent Institution, £18,449 6s.; and\r\nthe girls' school, £12,650 1s. 2d. The largest total attained previous\r\nto 1883 was in 1880, when the sum amounted to £49,763. The boys' school,\r\nwhich is now at the head of the list, is boarding, housing clothing, and\r\neducating 221 boys; the Benevolent Institution, the second on the list,\r\nis granting annuities of £40 each to 172 men and £32 each to 167 widows;\r\nand the girls' school houses, boards, clothes, and educates 239 girls,\r\nbetween the ages of seven and sixteen. The boys leave school at fifteen.\r\nDuring the year £8,675 has been granted to 334 cases of distress from\r\nthe Fund of Benevolence, which is composed of 4s. a year taken from\r\nevery London Mason's subscription to his lodge and 2s. a year from every\r\ncountry Mason's subscription. The local lodges meet as follows:--_At the\r\nMasonic Hall, New Street_: St. Paul's Lodge, No. 43; the Faithful Lodge,\r\nNo. 473; the Howe Lodge, No. 587; the Howe R.A. Chapter; the Howe Mark\r\nMaster's Lodge; the Howe Preceptory of Knight Templars; the Temperance\r\nLodge, No. 739; the Leigh Lodge, No. 887; the Bedford Lodge, No. 925;\r\nthe Bedford R.A.

Chapter;\r\nthe Athol Mark Master's Lodge; and the Lodge of Israel, No. 1,474. _At\r\nthe Great Western Hotel_: The Lodge of Light, No. 468; the R.A. Chapter\r\nof Fortitude; and the Vernon Chapter of S.P.R.C. of H.R.D.M., No. 5. _At\r\nthe Holte Hotel, Aston_: The Holte Lodge, No. 1,246.\r\n\r\n~Matches.~--Baker's are best, the maker says. Lucifer matches were the\r\ninvention of a young German patriot, named Kammerer, who beguiled his\r\ntime in prison (in 1832) with chemical experiments, though a North of\r\nEngland apothecary, Walker, lays claim to the invention. They were first\r\nmade in Birmingham in 1852, but they have not, as yet, completely driven\r\nthe old-fashioned, and now-despised tinder-box out of the world, as many\r\nof the latter are still manufactured in this town for sundry foreign\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n~Mecca.~--The late Mr. J.H. Chamberlain, shortly before his death, said\r\nthat he looked upon Birmingham, \"perhaps with a foolish pride,\" as the\r\nHoly City, the Mecca of England; where life was fuller of possibilities\r\nof utility--happier, broader, wiser, and a thousand times better than it\r\nwas in any other town in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n~Mechanical Engineers.~--The Institution of Mechanical Engineers was\r\norganised in this town, in October 1847, but its headquarters were\r\nremoved to London, in 1877.\r\n\r\n~Mechanics' Institute.~--The proposal to form a local institution of a\r\npopular nature, for the encouragement of learning among our workers,\r\nlike unto others which had been established in several large places\r\nelsewhere, was published in June, 1825, and several meetings were held\r\nbefore December 27, when officers were chosen, and entry made of nearly\r\n200 members, to start with, the subscription being 5/-per quarter. The\r\nformal opening took place March 21, 1826, the members assembling in\r\nMount Zion Chapel, to hear an address from Mr. B. Cook, the\r\nvice-president. The class-rooms, library, and reading-rooms, were at the\r\nschool attached to the Old Meeting House, and here the Institution, so\r\nfar as the conduct of classes, and the imparting of knowledge went,\r\nthrived and prospered. Financially, however, though at one time there\r\nwere nearly 500 members, it was never successful, possibly through lack\r\nof assistance that might have been expected from the manufacturers and\r\nlarge employers, for, hide it as we may, with a few honourable\r\nexceptions, that class, fifty years ago, preferred strong men to wise\r\nones, and rather set their banks against opening the doors of knowledge\r\nto their workpeople, or their children. It was a dozen years before the\r\nInstitution was able to remove to a home of its own in Newhall Street,\r\nbut it rapidly got into a hopeless state of debt. To lessen this\r\nincubus, and provide funds for some needed alterations, the committee\r\ndecided to hold an exhibition of \"manufactures, the fine arts, and\r\nobjects illustrative of experimental philosophy, &c.\" The exhibition was\r\nopened Dec. 19, 1839, and in all ways was a splendid success, a\r\nfairly-large sum of money being realised. Unfortunately, a second\r\nexhibition was held in the following years, when all the profits of the\r\nformer were not only lost, but so heavy an addition made to the debt,\r\nthat it may be said to have ruined the institution completely. Creditors\r\ntook possession of the premises in January, 1842, and in June operations\r\nwere suspended, and, notwithstanding several attempts to revive the\r\ninstitution, it died out altogether. As the only popular educational\r\nestablishment open to the young men of the time, it did good work, many\r\nof its pupils having made their mark in the paths of literature, art,\r\nand science.\r\n\r\n~Medical Associations.~--According to the \"Medical Register\" there are\r\n35 physicians and 210 surgeons resident in the borough, and there are\r\nrather more than 300 chemists and druggists. According to a summary of\r\nthe census tables, the medical profession \"and their subordinates\"\r\nnumber in Birmingham and Aston 940, of whom 376 are males and 564\r\nfemales. In 1834, at Worcester, under the presidency of Dr. Johnson, of\r\nthis town, the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association was formed\r\nfor encouraging scientific research, improving the practice of medicine,\r\nand generally looking after the interests of the profession. In 1856 the\r\nname was changed to The British Medical Association, with head offices\r\nin London, but prior to that branches had been established in various\r\nlarge towns, the Birmingham and Midland Counties' branch being foremost,\r\nholding its first meeting at Dee's Hotel, in December, 1854. The society\r\nhas now about 9,000 members, with a reserve fund of £10,000; in the\r\nlocal branch there are 359 members, who subscribe about £150 per annum.\r\n--The Birmingham Medical Institute was launched Feb. 5, 1876, but the\r\nquestion of admitting homeopathists as members was nearly the upsetting\r\nof the craft at the first meeting; thanks to the sails being trimmed\r\nwith a little common sense, however, the difficulty was tided over. The\r\nopening of the Institute in Edmund Street took place December 17, 1880.\r\nThe cost of the building was about £6,000, and the purposes to which it\r\nis applied are the providing accommodation for meetings of the\r\nprofession and the housing of the valuable medical library of over 6,000\r\nbooks. As something worthy of note, it may be mentioned that the\r\nInstitute was opened free from debt, the whole cost being previously\r\nsubscribed.\r\n\r\n~Memorials and Monuments.~--See \"_Statues,\" &c._\r\n\r\n~Men of Worth.~--The \"Toy-shop of the World,\" the home of workers, free\r\nfrom the blue blood of titled families, and having but few reapers of\r\n\"unearned increment,\" is hardly the place to look for \"men of worth or\r\nvalue\" in a monetary point of view, but we have not been without them. A\r\nwriter in _Gazette_, September 1, 1828, reckoned up 120 inhabitants who\r\nwere each worth over £10,000 each; 50 worth over £20,000; 16 worth over\r\n£50,000; 9 worth over £100,000; 3 worth over £200,000; 2 worth over\r\n£300,000 each, and 1 worth over £400,000. Taking certain Income Tax\r\nReturns and other information for his basis another man of figures in\r\n1878 made calculations showing that there were then among us some 800\r\npersons worth more than £5,000 each, 200 worth over £10,000, 50 worth\r\nover £20,000, 35 worth over £50,000, 26 worth over £100,000, 12 worth\r\nover £250,000, 5 worth over £500,000, and 2 worth over or near\r\n£1,000,000 each.\r\n\r\n~Mercia.~--In 585, this neighbourhood formed part of the Heptarchic\r\nkingdom of Mercia, under Cridda; in 697, Mercia was divided into four\r\ndioceses; this district being included in that of Lichfield; in 878,\r\nMercia was merged in the kingdom of England. According to Bede and the\r\nSaxon Chronicles, Beorned was, in 757, king of Mercia, of which\r\nBirmingham formed part, and in Canute's reign there was an Earl Beorn,\r\nthe king's nephew, and it has been fancifully suggested that in this\r\nname Beorn may lie the much-sought root for the etymology of the town's\r\nname. Beorn, or Bern, being derived from _ber_, a bear or boar, it might\r\nbe arranged thusly:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Ber_, bear or boar; _moeng_, many; _ham_, dwelling--the whole making\r\n  _Bermoengham_, the dwelling of many bears, or the home of many pigs!\r\n\r\n\r\n~Metchley Camp.~--At Metchley Park, about three miles from town, near to\r\nHarborne, there are the remains of an old camp or station which Hutton\r\nattributes to \"those pilfering vermin, the Danes,\" other writers\r\nthinking it was constructed by the Romans, but it is hardly possible\r\nthat an undertaking requiring such immense labour as this must have\r\ndone, could have been overlooked in any history of the Roman occupation.\r\nMore likely it was a stronghold of the native Britons who opposed their\r\nadvance, a superstition borne out by its being adjacent to their line of\r\nIcknield Street, and near the heart of England. From a measurement made\r\nin 1822, the camp appears to have covered an area of about 15-1/2 acres.\r\nHutton gives it as 30 acres, and describes a third embankment. The\r\npresent outer vallum was 330 yards long by 228 wide, and the interior\r\ncamp 187 yards long by 165 wide. The ancient vallum and fosse have\r\nsuffered much by the lapse of time, by the occupiers partially levelling\r\nthe ground, and by the passing through it of the Worcester and\r\nBirmingham canal, to make the banks of which the southern extremity of\r\nthe camp was completely destroyed. Some few pieces of ancient weapons,\r\nswords and battle-axes, and portions of bucklers, have been found here,\r\nbut nothing of a distinctively Roman or Danish character. As the\r\nfortification was of such great size and strength, and evidently formed\r\nfor no mere temporary occupation, had either of those passers-by been\r\nthe constructors we should naturally have expected that more positive\r\ntraces of their nationality would have been found.\r\n\r\n~Methodism.~--The introduction here must date from Wesley's first visit\r\nin March, 1738. In 1764, Moor Street Theatre was taken as a meeting\r\nplace, and John Wesley opened it March 21. The new sect afterwards\r\noccupied the King Street Theatre. Hutton says:--\"The Methodists\r\noccupied for many years a place in Steelhouse Lane, where the wags of\r\nthe age observed, 'they were eaten out by the bugs.' They therefore\r\nprocured the cast-off Theatre in Moor Street, where they continued to\r\nexhibit till 1782, when, quitting the stage, they erected a superb\r\nmeeting house in Cherry Street, at the expense of £1,200. This was\r\nopened, July 7, by John Wesley, the chief priest, whose extensive\r\nknowledge and unblemished manners give us a tolerable picture of\r\napostolic purity, who believed as if he were to be saved by faith, and\r\nwho laboured as if he were to be saved by works.\" The note made by\r\nWesley, who was in his 80th year, respecting the opening of Cherry\r\nStreet Chapel, has been preserved. He says:--\"July 6th, 1782. I came to\r\nBirmingham, and preached once more in the old dreary preaching-house.\r\nThe next day I opened the new house at eight, and it contained the\r\npeople well, but not in the evening, many more then constrained to go\r\naway. In the middle of the sermon a huge noise was heard, caused by the\r\nbreaking of a bench on which some people stood. None of them were hurt;\r\nyet it occasioned a general panic at first, but in a few minutes all was\r\nquiet.\" Four years after the opening, Wesley preached in the chapel\r\nagain, and found great prosperity. \"At first,\" he wrote, \"the\r\npreaching-house would not near contain the congregation. Afterwards I\r\nadministered the Lord's Supper to about 500 communicants.\" Old as he\r\nthen was, the apostle of Methodism came here a time or two after that,\r\nhis last visit being in 1790. Many talented men have since served the\r\nWesleyan body in this town, and the society holds a strong position\r\namong our Dissenting brethren. The minutes of the Wesleyan Conference\r\nlast issued give the following statistics of the Birmingham and\r\nShrewsbury District:--Church members, 18,875; on trial for membership,\r\nl,537; members of junior classes, 2,143; number of ministerial class\r\nleaders, 72; lay class leaders, 1,269; local or lay preachers, 769 (the\r\nlargest number in any district except Nottingham and Derby, which has\r\n798). There are 40 circuits in the district, of which 27 report an\r\nincrease of membership, and 13 a decrease.--See \"_Places of Worship_.\"\r\n\r\n~Methodism, Primitive.~--The origin of the Primitive Methodist Connexion\r\ndates from 1808, and it sprung solely from the custom (introduced by\r\nLorenzo Dow, from America, in the previous year) of holding \"camp\r\nmeetings,\" which the Wesleyan Conference decided to be \"highly improper\r\nin England, even if allowable in America, and likely to be productive of\r\nconsiderable mischief,\" expelling the preachers who conducted them. A\r\nnew society was the result, and the first service in this town was held\r\nin Moor Sreet, in the open air, near to the Public Office, in the summer\r\nof 1824. The first \"lovefeast\" took place, March 6, 1825, and the first\r\n\"camp meeting,\" a few months later. A circuit was formed, the first\r\nminister being the Rev. T. Nelson, and in 1826, a chapel was opened in\r\nBordesley Street, others following in due course of time, as the\r\nPrimitives increased in number. The Birmingham circuit contains about\r\n800 members, with over 2,000 Sunday School scholars, and 250 teachers.--\r\nSee \"_Places of Worship_.\"\r\n\r\n~Metric System.~--This, the simplest decimal system of computation yet\r\nlegalised is in use in France, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Spain, and other\r\nparts of Europe, as well as in Chili, Peru, Mexico, &c., and by 27 and\r\n28 Vic., cap. 117, its use has been rendered legal in this country. As\r\nour local trade with the above and other countries is increasing\r\n(unfortunately in some respects), rules for working out the metric\r\nmeasures into English and _vice versa_ may be useful. The unit of length\r\nis the _metre_ (equal to 39.37 inches); it is divided into tenths\r\n(decimetres), hundredths (centimetres), and thousandths (millimetres),\r\nand it is multiplied by decimals in like way into hectometres,\r\nkilometres, and myriometres. The unit of weight is the _gramme_, divided\r\nas the metre into decigrammes, centigrammes, and milligrammes;\r\nmultiplied into decagrammes, hectogrammes, and kilogrammes. The unit of\r\ncapacity is the _litre_, divided and multiplied like the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 inch equals 2-1/2 centimetres.\r\n1 foot equals 3 decimetres.\r\n1 mile equals 1-3/5 kilometres.\r\n1 cwt. equals 50.8 kilogrammes.\r\n1 ounce (troy) equals 31 grammes.\r\n1 pound (troy) equals 3.72 decagrammes.\r\n1 gallon equals 4-1/2 litres.\r\n1 quart equals 1-1/16 litres.\r\n1 metre equals 39.37 inches.\r\n1 hectometre equals 109-1/3 yards.\r\n1 cubic metre equals 61,027 cubic inches.\r\n1 kilometre equals 1,093 yards.\r\n1 decigramme equals 1-1/2 grains.\r\n1 gramme equals 15 grains.\r\n1 kilogramme equals 2-1/5 pounds (avoirdupois).\r\n1 litre equals 1-3/4 pints.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo turn inches into millimetres add the figures 00 to the number of\r\ninches, divide by 4, and add the result two-fifths of the original\r\nnumber of inches.\r\n\r\nTo turn millimetres to inches add the figure 0 and divide by 254.\r\n\r\nTo make cubic inches into cubic centimetres multiply by 721 and divide\r\nby 44; cubic centimetres into cubic inches multiply by 44 and divide by\r\n721.\r\n\r\nTo turn grains into grammes, multiply the number by 648 and divide the\r\nproduct by 10,000.\r\n\r\nTo turn grammes into grains, multiply by 10,000, dividing the result by\r\n648.\r\n\r\nThe metric system is especially useful in our local jewellery and other\r\ntrades, but it is very slowly making its way against the old English\r\nfoot and yaid, even such a learned man as Professor Rankine poking fun\r\nat the foreign measures in a comic song of which two verses run:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Some talk of millimetres, and some of kilogrammes,\r\n  And some of decillitres to measure beer and drams;\r\n  But I'm an English workman, too old to go to school,\r\n  So by pounds I'll eat, by quarts I'll drink, and work by my two-foot\r\n  rule.\r\n\r\n  A party of astronomers went measuring of the earth,\r\n  And forty million metres they took to be its girth;\r\n  Five hundred million inches now go through from pole to pole,\r\n  So we'll stick to inches, feet, and yards, and our own old two-foot\r\n  rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Mid-England.~--Meriden, near Coventry, is believed to be about the\r\ncentre spot of England.\r\n\r\n~Midland Institute.~--Suggestions of some such an institution, to take\r\nthe place of the defunct Mechanics', had several time appeared in print,\r\nbut nothing definite was done in the matter until the subject was\r\ndiscussed (June 4, 1852) over the dinner table of Mr. Arthur Ryland.\r\nPractical shape being given to the ideas then advanced, a town's meeting\r\non Dec. 3, 1853, sanctioned the grant by the Council of the land\r\nnecessary for the erection of a proper building, and an Act of\r\nIncorporation was obtained in the following Parliamentiry session. In\r\nDecember 1854, Charles Dickens gave three readings in the Town Hall, in\r\nbehalf of the building fund, whereby £227 13s. 9d. was realised, the\r\ndonations then amounting to £8,467. The foundation stone was laid by\r\nPrince Albert, on Nov. 22, 1855, and the contract for the first part of\r\nthe building given to Messrs. Branston and Gwyther for £12,000. The\r\nlecture theatre was opened Oct. 13, 1857, when addresses were delivered\r\nby Lord Brougham, Lord Russell, and Lord Stanley, the latter delivering\r\nthe prizes to the students who had attended the classes, which were\r\nfirst started in October, 1854, at the Philosophical Institute. In 1859,\r\nthe portrait of David Cox was presented to the Institute, forming the\r\nfirst contribution to the Fine Art Gallery, which was built on portion\r\nof the land originally given to the Institute, the whole of the\r\nbuildings being designed by Mr. E.M. Barry. The amount subscribed to the\r\nbuilding fund was about £18,000, and the coat, including furniture and\r\napparatus more than £16,000. Great extension has been made since then,\r\non the Paradise Street side, and many thousands spent on the\r\nenlargement, branch classes bring also held at several of the Board\r\nSchools to relieve the pressure on the Institute. In 1864, the members\r\nof the Institute numbered 660, and the students 880, with an income of\r\n£998; in January, 1874, there were 1,591 members, 733 family ticket\r\nholders. 2,172 students, and an income of £2,580. At the end of 1833,\r\nthe number of annual subscribers was 1,900, and lecture ticket-holders\r\n838. In the Industrial Department there were 4,334 students; the\r\nArchæological Section numbered 226 members, and the musical Section 183.\r\n108 students attended the Laws of Health classes, 220 the Ladies\r\nclasses, and 36 the classes for preparation for matriculation. The\r\nbenefits derived from the establishment of the Midland Institute, and\r\nthe amount of useful, practical, and scientific knowledge disseminated\r\nby means of its classes among the intelligent working men of the town\r\nand the rising generation, is incalculable. These classes, many of which\r\nare open at the low fee of 1d., and some others specially for females,\r\nnow include the whole of the following subjects:--English language and\r\nliterature, English history, French, German, Latin, Greek, and Spanish,\r\nalgebra, geometry, mensuration, trignometry, and arithmetic, music,\r\ndrawing, writing, English grammar, and composition, botany, chemistry,\r\nexperimental physics, practical mechanics, and metallurgy, elementary\r\nsinging, physical geography, animal physiology, geology, practical plane\r\nand solid geometry, &c. The general position of the Institute with\r\nregard to finance was as follows:--Gross receipts in General Department,\r\n£3,281 5s. 6d.; expenditure in this department (including £998 1s. 6d.\r\ndeficiency at the close of the year 1882), £3,088 17s. 2d.; balance in\r\nfavour of the General Department, £192 8s. 4d. Gross receipts in\r\nIndustrial Department, £1,747 13s.; expenditure in this department,\r\n£3,173 7s. 10d.; deficiency, £l,425 14s. 10d., met by a transfer from\r\nthe funds of the General Department. The total result of the year's\r\noperations in both departments left a deficiency of £1,233 6s. 6d. The\r\namount due to bankers on the General Fund was £863 13s. 6d; and the\r\namount standing to the credit of the Institute on the Repairs Account is\r\n£440 12s. 2d. It is much to be regretted that there is a total debt on\r\nthe Institute, amounting to £19,000, the paying of interest on which\r\nsadly retards its usefulness. Many munificent donations have been made\r\nto the funds of the Institute from time to time, one being the sum of\r\n£3,000, given by an anonymous donor in 186[**], \"in memory of Arthur\r\nRyland.\" In August, same year, it was announced that the late Mr. Alfred\r\nWilkes had bequeathed the bulk of his estate, estimated at about\r\n£100,000, in trust for his two sisters during their lives, with\r\nreversion in equal shares to the General Hospital and the Midland\r\nInstitute, being a deferred benefaction of £50,000 to each.\r\n\r\n~Midland Metropolis.~--Birmingham was so entitled because it was the\r\nlargest town, and has more inhabitants than any town in the centre of\r\nEngland. To use a Yankeeism, it is \"the hub\" of the Kingdom; here is the\r\nthrobbing heart of all that is Liberal in the political life of Europe;\r\nthis is the workshop of the world, the birth-spot of the steam-engine,\r\nand the home of mock jewellery. In all matters political, social, and\r\nnational, it takes the lead, and if London is the Metropolis of all that\r\nis effete and aristocratic, Birmingham has the moving-power of all that\r\nis progressive, recuperative and advancing. When Macaulay's New\r\nZealander sits sadly viewing the silent ruins of the once gigantic city\r\non the Thames, he will have the consolation of knowing that the\r\npulse-beats of his progenitors will still be found in the Mid-England\r\nMetropolis, once known as the town of Burningsham or Birmingham.\r\n\r\n~Mild Winters.~--The winter of 1658-9 was very mild, there being neither\r\nsnow or frost. In 1748 honeysuckles, in full bloom, were gathered near\r\nWorcester, in February. In the first four months of 1779 there was not a\r\nday's rain or snow, and on the 25th of March the cherry, plum, and pear\r\ntrees were in full bloom. An extraordinary mild winter was that of\r\n1782-3. A rose was plucked in an open garden, in New Street, on 30th\r\nDecember, 1820. In December, 1857, a wren's nest, with two eggs in it\r\nwas found near Selly Oak, and ripe raspberries were gathered in the\r\nChristmas week at Astwood Bank. The winter of 1883-4 is worthy of note,\r\nfor rose trees were budding in December, lambs frisking about in\r\nJanuary, and blackbirds sitting in February.\r\n\r\n~Milk.~--The reports of the Borough Analyst for several successive\r\nyears, 1879 to 1882, showed that nearly one-half the samples of milk\r\nexamined were adulterated, the average adulteration of each being as\r\nmuch as 20 per cent.; and a calculation has been made that the Brums pay\r\n£20,000 a year for the water added to their milk! Next to the bread we\r\neat, there is no article that should be kept freer from adulteration\r\nthan milk, and the formation of a Dairy Company, in April, 1882, was\r\nhailed as a boon by many. The Company started with a nominal capital of\r\n£50,000 in £5 shares, and it rigidly prosecutes any farmer who puts the\r\nmilk of the \"wooden cow\" into their cans.\r\n\r\n~Minories.~--Once known as Upper and Lower Minories, the latter name\r\nbeing given to what, at other times, has been called \"Pemberton's Yard\"\r\nor the \"Coach Yard.\" The names give their own meaning, the roads leading\r\nto the Priory.\r\n\r\n~Mints.~--See \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Missionary Work.~--About a million and a quarter sterling is yearly\r\ncontributed in England to Foreign, Colonial, and Home Missionary\r\nSocieties, and Birmingham sends its share very fairly. The local\r\nAuxiliary, to the Church Missionary Society, in 1882, gathered £2,133\r\n8s. 6d.; in 1883 (to June both years) it reached £2,774 17s. 8d., of\r\nwhich £2,336 6s 11d. was from collections in the local churches. The\r\nAuxiliary to the London Missionary Society gathered £1,050, of which\r\n£991 was collected in churches and chapels. The Baptist Missionary\r\nSociety was founded in October, 1792, and branch was started here a few\r\nmonths afterwards, the first fruits totting up to the very respectable\r\namount of £70. A branch of the Wesleyan Missionary Society was formed\r\nhere in 1814 for the Birmingham and Shrewsbury district, and the amounts\r\ngathered in 1882 totalled £4,829 10s. 3d. To the Society for promoting\r\nChristianity among the Jews, the Birmingham Auxiliaries in 1883 sent\r\n£323. There are also Auxiliaries of the Church of England Zenana, of the\r\nSouth American, and of one or two other Missionary Societies. The Rev.\r\nJ.B. Barradale, who died in China, early in 1879, while relieving\r\nsufferers from famine, was educated at Spring Hill College. He was sent\r\nout by the London Missionary Society, and his death was preceded by that\r\nof his wife and only child, who died a few weeks before him, all from\r\nfever caught while helping poor Chinamen.\r\n\r\n~Moated Houses.~--The Parsonage, as well as the Manor House (as noted\r\nelsewhere), were each surrounded by its moat, and, possibly, no portion\r\nof the United Kingdom could show more family mansions, and country\r\nresidences, protected in this manner, than the immediate district\r\nsurrounding Birmingham. Many more or-less-preserved specimens of these\r\nold-fashioned houses, with their water guards round them, are to be met\r\nwith by the rambler, as at Astwood Bank. Erdington, Inkberrow, Yardley,\r\nWyrley, &c. Perhaps, the two best are Maxtoke Castle, near Coleshill,\r\nand the New Hall, Sutton Coldfield.\r\n\r\n~Modern Monasteries.~--The foundation-stone of St. Thomas's Priory, at\r\nErdington, for the accommodation of the Monks of the Order of St.\r\nBenedict, was laid on Aug. 5, 1879, by the Prior, the Rev. Hildebrand de\r\nHemptinne. Alter the date, and the reader might fancy himself living in\r\nMediæval times.\r\n\r\n~Monument.~--The high tower erected near the Reservoir has long borne\r\nthe name of \"The Monument,\" though it has been said it was built more as\r\na strange kind of pleasure-house, where the owner, a Mr. Perrott, could\r\npass his leisure hours witnessing coursing in the day-time, or making\r\nastronomical observations at night. Hence it was often called \"Perrott's\r\nFolly.\" It dates from 1758--See also \"_Statues_,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Moody and Sankey.~--These American Evangelists, or Revivalists, visited\r\nhere in Jan. 1875, their first meeting being held in the Town Hall, on\r\nthe 17th, the remainder of their services (to February 7) being given in\r\nBingley Hall. They came also in February, 1883. when the last-named\r\nplace again accommodated them.\r\n\r\n~Moor Street.~--Rivaling Edgbaston Street in its antiquity, its name has\r\nlong given rise to debate as to origin, but the most likely solution of\r\nthe puzzle is this: On the sloping land near here, in the 14th century,\r\nand perhaps earlier, there was a mill, probably the Town Mill, and by\r\nthe contraction of the Latin, _Molendinaria_, the miller would be called\r\nJohn le Molendin, or John le Moul. The phonetic style of writing by\r\nsound was in great measured practised by the scriveners, and thus we\r\nfind, as time went on, the street of the mill became Moul, Moule, Mowle,\r\nMolle, Moll, More, and Moor Street. A stream crossed the street near the\r\nWoolpack, over which was a wooden bridge, and farther on was another\r\nbridge of more substantial character, called \"Carter's Bridge.\" In flood\r\ntimes, Cars Lane also brought from the higher lands copious streams of\r\nwater, and the keeping of Moor Street tidy often gave cause to mention\r\nthese spots in old records, thus:--\r\n\r\n                                         £   s.  d.\r\n  1637--Paid Walter Taylor for ridding\r\n         the gutters in Moor Street      0   0   11\r\n  1665--Zachary Gisborne 42 loads of\r\n         mudd out of Moore Street   ..   0   0    7\r\n  1676--J. Bridgens keepinge open\r\n         passage and tourneing water\r\n         from Cars Lane that it did\r\n         not runne into More Street\r\n         for a yeare    ..  ..  ..  ..   0   4    0\r\n  1688--Paid mending Carter's Bridge\r\n         timber and worke   ..  ..  ..   0   5    0\r\n  1690--John, for mending Moore Street\r\n         Bridg  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..   0   0   10\r\n\r\n\r\nMoor Street, from the earliest date, was the chosen place of residence\r\nfor many of the old families, the Carless, Smalbroke, Ward, Sheldon,\r\nFlavell, Stidman, and other names, continually cropping up in deeds;\r\nsome of the rents paid to the Lord of the Manor, contrasting curiously\r\nwith the rentals of to-day. For three properties adjoining in More\r\nStreet, and which were so paid until a comparatively modern date, the\r\nrents were:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"One pound of pepper by Goldsmythe and Lench,\r\n  Two pounds of pepper by the master of the Gild,\r\n  One pound of cumin seed, one bow, and six barbed bolts, or arrow heads\r\n  by John Sheldon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Moseley.~--One of the popular, and soon will be populous suburbs,\r\nconnected as it is so closely to us by Balsall Heath. It is one of the\r\nold Domesday-mentioned spots, but has little history other than\r\nconnected with the one or two families who chose it for their residence\r\nages ago. It is supposed the old church was erected prior to the year\r\n1500, a tower being added to it in Henry VIII.'s reign, but the parish\r\nregister dates only from the middle of last century, possibly older\r\nentries being made at King's Norton (from which Moseley was\r\necclesiastically divided in 1852). Moseley does not appear to have been\r\nnamed from, or to have given name to, any particular family, the\r\nearliest we have any note about being Greves, or Grevis, whose tombs are\r\nin King's Norton Church, one of the epitaphs being this:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Ascension day on ninth of May,\r\n  Third year of King James' reine,\r\n  To end my time and steal my coin,\r\n  I William Greves was slain.   1605.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHutton says that the old custom of \"heriot\" was practised here; which is\r\nnot improbable, as instances have occurred in neighbourhood of\r\nBromsgrove and other parts of the county within the past few years. This\r\nrelic of feudalism, or barbarism, consists of the demanding for the lord\r\nof the manor the best movable article, live or dead, that any tenant\r\nhappens to be possessed of at the time of his death.\r\n\r\n~Moseley Hall.~--Hutton relates that on July 21, 1786, one Henshaw\r\nGrevis came before him in the court of Requests, as a poor debtor, who,\r\nthirty years before, he had seen \"completely mounted and dressed in\r\ngreen velvet, with a hunter's cap and girdle, at the head of the pack.\"\r\nThis poor fellow was the last member of a family who had held the\r\nMoseley Hall estate from the time of the Conquest. In the riots of 1791\r\nthe Hall was burnt down, being rebuilt ten years after.\r\n\r\n~Mothering Sunday~, or Mid-Lent Sunday, has its peculiarities according\r\nto districts. In Birmingham the good people who like to keep up old\r\ncustoms sit down to veal and custard. At Draycot-le-Moors they eat pies\r\nmade of figs. The practice of visiting the parents' home on this day was\r\none of those old-time customs so popular in the days of our grandfathers\r\nand great-grandfathers (but which, with many others have fallen into\r\ndisuse), and this is supposed to have given rise to the \"Mothering\r\nSunday\" name. Prior to the Reformation, the Catholics kept the day as a\r\nholy day, in honour of the Mother of Jesus, it being a Protestant\r\ninvention to turn the fast-day into one of feasting.\r\n\r\n~Mount Misery.~--At the close of the great war, which culminated at\r\nWaterloo, it was long before the blessings of peace brought comfort to\r\nthe homes of the poor. The first effects of the sheathing of the sword\r\nwas a collapse in prices of all kinds, and a general stagnation of\r\ntrade, of which Birmingham, made prosperous through the demand for its\r\nguns, &c., felt the full force. Bad trade was followed by bad harvests,\r\nand the commercial history of the next dozen years is but one huge\r\nchronicle of disaster, shops and mills closing fast, and poverty\r\nfollowing faster. How to employ the hundreds of able-bodied men\r\ndependent on the rates was a continual puzzle to the Overseers, until\r\nsomeone, wise in his generation, hit upon the plan of paying the\r\nunfortunates to wheel sand from the bank then in front of Key Hill House\r\nup to the canal side, a distance of 1-1/2 miles, the payment being at\r\nthe rate of one penny per barrow load. This fearful \"labour test\" was\r\ncontinued for a long time, and when we reckon that each man would have\r\nto wheel his barrow backwards and forwards for nearly 20 miles to earn a\r\nshilling, moving more than a ton of sand in the process we cannot wonder\r\nat the place receiving such a woeful name as Mount Misery.\r\n\r\n~M.P.'s for Borough.~--See \"_Parliamentary_.\"\r\n\r\n~Mules.~-These animals are not often seen about town now, but in the\r\npolitically-exciting days of 1815 they apparently were not strangers in\r\nour streets, as Mr. Richard Spooner (who, like our genial Alderman\r\nAvery, was fond of \"tooling\" his own cattle), was in the habit of\r\ndriving his own mail-drag into town, to which four mules were harnessed.\r\nWith Mr. Thomas Potts, a well-to-do merchant, a \"bigoted Baptist,\" and\r\nultra-Radical, Mr. Spooner and Mr. T. Attwood took part in a deputation\r\nto London, giving occasion to one of the street-songs of the day:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Tommy Potts has gone to town\r\n    To join the deputation;\r\n  He is a man of great renown,\r\n    And fit to save the nation.\r\n            Yankee doodle do,\r\n            Yankee doodle dandy.\r\n\r\n  Dicky Spooner's also there,\r\n    And Tom the Banker, too;\r\n  If in glory they should share,\r\n    We'll sing them 'Cock-a-doodle-doo.'\r\n            Yankee doodle do,\r\n            Yankee doodle dandy.\r\n\r\n  Dicky Spooner is Dicky Mule,\r\n    Tom Attwood is Tom Fool;\r\n  And Potts an empty kettle,\r\n    With lots of bosh and rattle.\r\n            Yankee doodle do,\r\n            Yankee doodle dandy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother of the doggerel verses, alluding to Mr. Spooner's mules, ran--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Tommy Potts went up to town,\r\n    Bright Tom, who all surpasses,\r\n  Was drawn by horses out of town,\r\n    And in again by asses.\r\n            With their Yankee doodle do,\r\n            Yankee doodle dandy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Municipal Expenditure.~--Fortunately the population of Birmingham is\r\ngoing ahead rapidly, and the more the children multiply the more \"heads\r\nof families\" we may naturally hope there will be noted down as\r\nratepayers by the heads of the gather-the-tin office. The cost of\r\ngoverning our little town is not at all heavy, and when divided out at\r\nper head of the inhabitants it seems but a mere bagatelle. Mr. J. Powell\r\nWilliams, who takes credit for being a financier and man of figures,\r\nsaid in 1884 that the totals of our municipal expenditure for the past\r\nfew years were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  In 1879 it was £354,000 or 18/3 per head\r\n   \" 1880   \"     343,900 \"  17/5    \"\r\n   \" 1881   \"     361,500 \"  18/0    \"\r\n   \" 1882   \"     374,000 \"  18/4    \"\r\n   \" 1883   \"     385,000 \"  18/7    \"\r\n   \" 1884   \"     385,000 \"  18/3    \"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bachelors who live in apartments will surely be tempted to begin\r\nhousekeeping when they see how low a sum it takes to pay for all the\r\nblessings conferred upon us by a Liberal Corporation; but what the Pater\r\nof half-a-dozen olive branches may think about the matter, is altogether\r\na different thing, especially when he finds that to the above 18/2 per\r\nhead must be added 2/7-1/2 per head for the School Board, and 1s. 2d.\r\nper head for the Drainage Board, besides poor-rates, Government taxes,\r\ngas, water, and all these other little nothings that empty the purse.\r\n\r\n~Murder and Manslaughter.~--It would be _too_ black a catalogue to give\r\nall the horrible cases of this nature which the local journals have\r\nchronicled in past years, those here noted being only such as have a\r\ncertain historical interest.\r\n\r\n\"Tom and Jack.\"--\"See _Executions_.\"\r\n\r\nSergeant William Cartwright, of the Coldstream Guards, was killed in\r\nTownsend's Yard by a deserter, September 13, 1796.\r\n\r\nA desperate attempt was made to murder a young woman in Bull Street in\r\nthe evening of a fair day, June 9, 1797.\r\n\r\nPhilip Matsell was hanged August 22, 1806, at the bottom of Snow Hill,\r\nfor attempting to murder a watchman.--See \"_Executions_.\"\r\n\r\nA Mr. Pennington, of London, was murdered at Vauxhall, Feb. 6. 1817.\r\n\r\nAshford, Mary, May 27, 1817, murdered at Sutton Coldfield.\r\n\r\nF. Adams was murdered by T. Johnson, in London 'Prentice Street, Aug. 5,\r\n1821.\r\n\r\nMr. R. Perry was killed in Mary Ann Street, by Michael Ford, December 6,\r\n1825.

He was buried as a\r\n_felo de se_.\r\n\r\nFrancis Mason, Litimer Street, stabbed his wife, June 25, 1867, but the\r\njury called it manslaughter, and he was allowed to retire for five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWilliam Toy, a glasscutter, was killed in the Plasterers' Arms, Lupin\r\nStreet, July 20, 1878, in a drunken row.\r\n\r\nEdward Johnson, a retired butcher, of this town, killed his wife and\r\ndrowned himself at Erdington, July 27, 1878.\r\n\r\nSarah Alice Vernon, married woman, aged 26, was first stabbed and then\r\nflung into the canal, at Spring Hill, by her paramour, John Ralph, a\r\nhawker of fancy baskets, early in the morning of May 31, 1879. He was\r\nhung August 26.\r\n\r\nCaroline Brooks, a young woman of 20, was fatally stabbed on the night\r\nof June 28, 1879, while walking with her sweetheart, but the man who\r\nkilled her escaped.\r\n\r\nAlfred Wagstaffe, of Nechell's Green, kicked his wile for pawning his\r\nshirt, on October 25, 1879. She died a week after, and he was sent to\r\npenal servitude for ten years.\r\n\r\nAn Irishman, named John Gateley, was shot on Saturday, December 5, 1880,\r\nin a beerhouse at Solihull, by a country man who got away; the murdered\r\nman had been connected with the Irish Land League.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ellen Jackson, a widow, 34 years of age, through poverty and\r\ndespondency, poisoned herself and two children, aged seven and nine, on\r\nSunday, November 27, 1881. One child recovered.\r\n\r\nFrederick Serman, at the Four Dwellings, near Saltley, Nov. 22, 1883,\r\nshot Angelina Yanwood, and poisoned himself, because the woman would not\r\nlive longer with him \"to be clemmed.\"\r\n\r\nJames Lloyd, Jan. 6, 1884, stabbed his wife Martha, because she had not\r\nmet him the previous afternoon.

Few\r\ntowns can show such a list of patentees and inventors, but we have no\r\nPatent Museum wherein to preserve the outcome of their ideas. Though the\r\ntown's very name cannot be traced through the mists of dim antiquity,\r\nthe most ancient thing we can show is the Old Crown public-house. Romans\r\nand Normans, Britons and Saxons, have all trod the same ground as\r\nourselves, but we preserve no relics of them. Though we have supplied\r\nthe whole earth with firearms, it was left to Mr. Marshall, of Leeds, to\r\ngather together a Gun Museum. Fortunately the Guardians of the Proof\r\nHouse were liberal and, buying the collection for £1,550, made many\r\nvaluable additions to it, and after exhibiting it for a time at 5,\r\nNewhall Street, presented it to the town in August, 1876. There is a\r\ncurious miscellany of articles on exhibition at Aston Hall, which some\r\nmay call a \"Museum,\" and a few cases of birds, sundry stuffed animals,\r\n&c., but we must wait until the Art Gallery now in course of erection,\r\nis finished before the Midland Metropolis can boast of owning a real\r\nMuseum. At various times, some rich examples of industrial art have been\r\nexhibited in the temporary Art Gallery adjoining the Midland Institute,\r\nand now, in one of the rooms of the Free Library, there are sufficient\r\nto form the nucleus of a good Museum. We may, therefore, hope that, in\r\ntime, we _shall_ have a collection that we may be proud of. Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain (April 26, 1875) gave £1,000 to purchase objects of\r\nindustrial art, and it has been expended in the purchase of a collection\r\nof gems and precious stones, than which nothing could be more suitable\r\nin this centre of the jewellery trade. Possibly, on the opening of the\r\nnew Art Gallery, we shall hear of other \"thousands\" as forthcoming.\r\n\r\n~Musical Associations.~--There were, of course, the choirs attached to\r\nthe churches previous, but the earliest Musical Society is believed to\r\nbe that established by James Kempson, in 1762, at Cooke's, in the Cherry\r\nOrchard, and the founding of which led to the Musical Festivals. The\r\nmembers met for practice, and evidently enjoyed their pipes and glasses,\r\ntheir nightly song being:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"To our Musical Club here's long life and prosperity;\r\n  May it flourish with us, and so on to posterity,\r\n  May concord and harmony always abound,\r\n  And division here only in music be found.\r\n  May the catch and the glass go about and about,\r\n  And another succeed to the bottle that's out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis society was appropriately known as the Musical and Amicable Society\r\nfrom which sprung the Choral Society in 1776, though the present\r\nFestival Choral Society only claims to be in its thirty eighth year. The\r\nBirmingham Musical Society dates from 1840; the Amateur Harmonic\r\nAssociation from January, 1856; the Edgbaston Musical Union from 1874;\r\nand the Philharmonic Union from 1870. The Church Schools Choral Union,\r\nthe Sunday Schools Union Festival Choir, and the Birmingham Musical\r\nAssociation, with one or two others, are the progeny of later years; the\r\nlast on the list of musical institutions being the Clef Club (in\r\nExchange Buildings), established March 21st, 1832, for the promotion of\r\nmusical culture by \"providing a central resort for the study and\r\npractice of vocal and instrumental music, with the social advantages of\r\na club.\"\r\n\r\n~Musical Festivals.~--The credit of suggesting the first Musical\r\nFestival in aid of the funds of the General Hospital, has been assigned\r\nto Mr. Kempson a local musician, who, with his friends, formed a Glee\r\nand Catch Club at Cooke's, in the Cherry Orchard. The minutes-book of\r\nthe Hospital under date of May 3, 1768, records that a resolution was\r\npassed that \"a musical entertainment\" should be arranged, and it was\r\nheld accordingly on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of September in that year,\r\npart of the performances taking place at St. Philip's Church, and part\r\nat the Theatre, then in King Street, the Festival being wound up with a\r\nball \"at Mrs. Sawyer's, in the Square.\" Church, Theatre, and Ball was\r\nthe order of the day for many succeeding Festivals, the Town Hall, which\r\nmay be said to have been built almost purposely for these performances,\r\nnot being ready until 1834. The Theatre was only utilised for one\r\nevening each Festival after until 1843, when three concerts were held\r\ntherein, but since that date the Town Hall has been found sufficient.\r\nThe Festival Balls were long a great attraction (no less than 1,700\r\nattending in 1834), but, possibly from a too free admixture of the\r\ngeneral public, the aristocratic patronage thereof gradually declined\r\nuntil 1858, when only 300 tickets having been taken, the Ball night was\r\nstruck out of the future programmes. The first Festival performances\r\nwere by purely local artistes, and on several occasions afterwards they\r\nformed the bulk of the performers, but as the fame of our Festivals\r\nincreased so did the inflow of the foreign element, until at one period\r\nnot more than half-a-dozen local names could be found in any programme.\r\nThis has been altered to a considerable extent of late years, so much so\r\nthat at the last Festival nearly the whole of the chorus of voices was\r\ncomposed of members of our local Musical Societies, and a fair\r\nsprinkling of the instrumentalists also. A big book would be required\r\nfor a full history of the Birmingham Triennial Festivals, descriptive of\r\ntheir rise and progress, the hundreds of musical novelties introduced,\r\nthe many scores of talented artistes who have taken parts, the lords and\r\nladies who have attended, and the thousand odd notes appertaining to\r\nthem all. In the following notes are briefly chronicled the \"first\r\nappearances,\" &c., with the results and other items for reference.\r\n\r\n1768, Sept. 7 to 9. The oratorios of \"Il Penseroso;\" and \"Alexander's\r\nFeast\" were performed at the Theatre in King Street; Handel's \"Te Deum\"\r\nand \"Jubilate\" with the \"Messiah,\" at St. Philip's Church. The principal\r\nsingers were Mrs. Pinto, first soprano, and Mr. Charles Norris, tenor;\r\nthe orchestra numbered about 70, the conductor being Mr. Capel Bond of\r\nCoventry, with Mr. Pinto as leader of the band. The tickets of admission\r\nwere 5s. each, the receipts (with donations) amounting to about £800,\r\nand the profits to £299.\r\n\r\n1778, Sept. 2 to 4. The performances this time (and for fifteen\r\nfestivals after), were at St. Philip's Church, and at the newly-built\r\ntheatre in New Street, the oratorios, &c., including \"Judas Maccabæus,\"\r\nthe \"Messiah,\" Handel's \"Te Deum,\" \"Jubilate,\" \"Acis and Galatea,\" &c.\r\nPrincipal performers: Miss Mahon, Miss Salmon, Mr. C. Norris, and\r\nCervetto, a celebrated violoncellist, the leader of the band being Mr.\r\nWilliam Cramer, a popular violinist. The choir had the assistance of\r\n\"the celebrated women chorus singers from Lancashire.\" The receipts were\r\nagain about £800, and the profits £340, which sum was divided between\r\nthe Hospital and the building fund for St. Paul's.\r\n\r\n1784, Sept. 22 to 24. President: Lord Dudley and Ward. Following after\r\nthe celebrated Handel Commemoration the programme was filled almost\r\nsolely with selections from Handel's works, the only novelty being the\r\noratorio of \"Goliath,\" composed by Mr. Atterbury, which according to one\r\nmodern musical critic, has never been heard of since. Master Bartleman,\r\nwho afterwards became the leading bass singer of the day, was the\r\nnovelty among the performers. Receipts, £1,325; profits, £703.\r\n\r\n1787, Aug. 22 to 24. President, the Earl of Aylesford. In addition to\r\nthe miscellaneous (mostly Handelian) pieces, the oratories performed\r\nwere \"Israel in Egypt\" and the \"Messiah,\" the latter being so remarkably\r\nsuccessful that an extra performance of it was given on the Saturday\r\nfollowing. Among the perfumers were Mrs. Billington (first soprano), Mr.\r\nSamuel Harrison (one of the finest tenor singers ever heard in England),\r\nand Mr. John Sale (a rich-toned bass), and the \"women chorus.\" Receipts\r\nabout £2,000; profits, £964.\r\n\r\n1790, Aug. 25 to 27. President, Lord Dudley and Ward. The \"Messiah,\"\r\nwith miscellaneous selections, the principal performers being Madame\r\nMara, Mr. Reinhold, and Mr. Charles Knyvett, with Jean Mara\r\n(violoncellist) and John Christian Fischer (oboeist) The prices of\r\nadmission were raised at this Festival to 10s. 6d. and 7s.; Theatre\r\nboxes 7s. 6d., pit 5s., gallery 3s. 6d.

The\r\nperformances were like those of 1790, of a general character, besides\r\nthe \"Messiah;\" while the two principal sopranos were the Misses\r\nFletcher, daughters of a local musician. The trombone was introduced at\r\nthis Festival for the first time. Receipts £2,043 18s.; profits £897.\r\n\r\n1792, September 18 to 20. President, the Earl of Warwick.

Among the vocalists were Madame Dussek, Mrs.\r\nMountain, John Braham (_the_ Braham of undying fame), and Mr. William\r\nKnyvett; Mr. Francois Cramer, leader of the band (and at every festival\r\nuntil 1843), had with him Andrew Ashe (flautist), Aufossi (double bass),\r\n&c., with over 100 in the orchestra. Receipts, £3,820 17s. O-1/4d.;\r\nprofits, £2,380.\r\n\r\n1805, Oct. 2 to 4. President, the Earl of Aylesford. The \"Messiah\" was\r\ngiven for the first time here with Mozart's accompaniments; part of the\r\n\"Creation\" &c.

Kiesewetter (who died the\r\nfollowing year), Charles Augustus de Beriot (who married Madame\r\nMalibran-Garcia), and quite a host of local instrumentalists who were\r\nlong chief among our Birmingham musicians. Receipts £10,104; profits\r\n£4,592.\r\n\r\n1829, Oct. 6 to 9. President, the Earl of Bradford. This was the Jubilee\r\nYear of the General Hospital, and conspicuous in the programme was the\r\n\"Jubilee Anthem\" in commemoration of the fiftieth year of its\r\nestablishment, the words being adapted to the music composed by\r\nCherubini for Charles X.s coronation. This was also the last year in\r\nwhich the Festival performances took place in St. Philip's Church or\r\n(except several single nights of operatic selections) at the Theatre.\r\nBesides the \"Jubilee Anthem,\" there were novelties in the shape of\r\nZingarelli's \"Cantata Sacra\" (described in a musical publication as a\r\n\"tame, insipid, heap of commonplace trash\"), and the introduction of\r\n\"operatic selections\" at the evening concerts. Amongst the performers\r\nwho made their _debut_ in Birmingham were Madame Malibran-Garcia, Mdlle.\r\nBlasis, Miss Fanny Ayton, Signor Costa, Signor Guibelei, Mrs. Anderson\r\n(who gave pianoforte lessons to Princess Victoria), and Mr. Charles\r\nLucas (violoncello). Receipts, £9,771; profits, £3,806 17s.\r\n\r\n1834, Oct. 7 to 10. President, the Earl of Aylesford.

Receipts, £13,527; profits,\r\n£4,035.\r\n\r\n1837, Sept. 19 to 22. President, Lord Willoughby de Broke. Mendelssohn's\r\nnew oratorio, \"St. Paul\" (oft mistakenly supposed to have been specially\r\nwritten for the occasion), was the most important production, but\r\nNeukomm's \"Ascension,\" Hæser's \"Triumph of Faith,\" and several other new\r\ncompositions were performed on this occasion. In addition to\r\nMendelssohn's first appearance here as conductor, there were other new\r\nfaces, among them being Madame Giula Grisi, Madame Emma Albertazzi, Mrs.\r\nAlbert Shaw, Signor Antonio Tamburini, Mr. Alfred Mellon (in his 17th\r\nyear, but even then leader of the band at the Theatre), Signor Regondi\r\n(concertina player), &c. Receipts, £11,900, but, as besides more than\r\nusually heavy expenses, £1,200 was paid for building the recess in which\r\nthe organ was placed, the profits were only £2,776.\r\n\r\n1840, Sept. 22 to 25. President, Lord Leigh. The oratorio, \"Israel in\r\nEgypt,\" by Handel, selections from his \"Jephtha,\" and \"Joshua,\" and\r\nMendelssohn's \"Hymn of Praise,\" were the great features of this\r\nFestival, at which appeared for the first time Madame Dorus-Gras, Miss\r\nM.B. Hawes, Signor Louis Lablache, with Mr. T. Cooke, and Mr. H.G.\r\nBlagrove (two clever violinists). Receipts, £11,613; profits, £4,503.\r\n\r\n1843, Sept. 19 to 22. President, Earl Craven. The performances at the\r\nTown Hall included Handel's oratorio, \"Deborah,\" Dr. Crotch's\r\n\"Palestine,\" and Rossini's \"Stabat Mater,\" the introduction of the\r\nlatter causing a considerable flutter among some of the local clergy,\r\none of whom described it as the most idolatrous and anti-Christian\r\ncomposition that could be met with. The Theatre this year was used for\r\nthree evening concerts, &c. Among the new vocalists were Miss Rainforth,\r\nSignor Mario, Signer Fornasari, and Mr. Manvers. The organists were Dr.\r\nSamuel Sebastian Wesley and our Mr. James Stimpson, who had succeeded\r\nMr. George Hollins as Town Hall organist in the previous year. Receipts,\r\n£8,822; profits, £2,916.\r\n\r\n1846, Aug. 25 to 28. President, Lord Wrottesley. This is known as \"The\r\nElijah Festival,\" from the production of Mendelssohn's _chef d'oeuvre_\r\nthe \"Elijah\" oratorio. The performers were mostly those who had been\r\nhere before, save Miss Bassano, the Misses Williams, Mr. Lockey, and\r\nHerr Joseph Staudigl. Receipts, £11,638; profits, £5,508.\r\n\r\n1849, Sept. 4 to 7. President, Lord Guernsey. This Festival is\r\nespecially noteworthy as being the first conducted by Sir Michael Costa,\r\nalso for the number of \"principals\" who had not previously taken part in\r\nthe Festivals, for the extreme length of the evening programmes, each\r\nlasting till after midnight; and, lastly, from the fact, that out of a\r\nbody of 130 instrumentalists, only eight or nine Birmingham musicians\r\ncould be found to please the _maestro's_ taste. The oratorios of the\r\n\"Messiah,\" \"Elijah,\" and \"Israel in Egypt,\" were the principal pieces,\r\nwith Mendelssohn's \"First Walpurgis Night,\" and Prince Albert's\r\n\"L'Invocazione dell' Armonia;\" the remainder being of the most varied\r\ncharacter. The first appearances included Madame Sontag, Madame\r\nCastellan, Miss Catherine Hayes, Mdlle. Alboni, Miss Stevens (afterwards\r\nMrs. Hale), Mdlle. Jetty de Treffz, Sims Reeves, Herr Pischek (baritone\r\nbasso), Signor Bottesini (double bass), M. Sigismund Thalberg (pianist),\r\nM. Prospere Sainton (violinist), &c.

President, Lord Willoughby de Broke, The programme\r\nincluded Costa's \"Eli\" (composed for the occasion), Beethoven's \"Mount\r\nof Olives,\" Glover's \"Tam O'Shanter,\" Macfarren's cantata \"Lenora,\" and\r\nMozart's \"Requiem;\" the fresh artistes being Madame Rudersdorf, Signor\r\nGardoni, and Herr Reichardt. Receipts £12,745; profits, £3,108, in\r\naddition to £1,000 spent on decorating, &c., the Hall and organ.\r\n\r\n1858, Aug. 31 to Sept. 3. President, the Earl of Dartmouth. The\r\nnovelties included Mendelssohn's Hymn \"Praise Jehovah,\" Beethoven's\r\n\"Mass in C.\" Leslie's Cantata \"Judith,\" Mendelssohn's Cantata \"To the\r\nSons of Art,\" Costa's serenata \"The Dream,\" &c.

The\r\nnew introductions comprised Mdlle. Titiens, Mdlle. Adelina Patti, Mdlle.\r\nLemmens-Sherrington, Miss Palmer, Signor Giuglini, Mr. Santley, and Miss\r\nArabella Goddard. Beethoven's \"Mass in D,\" and Hummel's Motett \"Alma\r\nVirgo\" were part of the programme, which included not only the \"Messiah\"\r\nand \"Elijah,\" but also \"Samson\" and \"The Creation,\" &c. Receipts,\r\n£11,453; profits, £3,043.\r\n\r\n1864, Sept. 6 to 9. President, the Earl of Lichfield. Costa's \"Naaman,\"\r\nSullivan's \"Kenilworth,\" Guglieml's \"Offertorium,\" and Mozart's \"Twelfth\r\nMass\" were produced. Mr. W.H. Cummings made his first appearance.\r\nReceipts, £13,777; profits, £5,256.\r\n\r\n1867, Aug. 27 to 29. President, Earl Beauchamp.

President, the Earl of Shrewsbury and Talbot. The\r\nmost important of the novelties were Sullivan's \"Light of the World,\"\r\nand Schira's \"Lord of Burleigh,\" but the greatest attraction of all was\r\nthe patronising presence of royalty in the person of the Duke of\r\nEdinburgh. Receipts, £16,097; profits, £6,391.\r\n\r\n1876, Aug. 29 to Sept. 1. President, the Marquis of Hertford. Herr\r\nWagner's \"Holy Supper,\" Mr. Macfarren's \"Resurrection,\" Mr. F.H.

The principal performers\r\nwere Madame Albani, Mrs. Hutchinson, Miss Anna Williams, Madame Patey,\r\nMadame Trebelli; Messrs. Edward Lloyd, Joseph Maas, Santley, Signor\r\nFoli. Herr Richter was the conductor. Works performed were:--Oratorio,\r\n\"Elijah\"; new Cantata, \"Sleeping Beauty\"; new Oratorio, \"Mors et Vita\";\r\nnew cantata, \"Yule Tide\"; Oratorio, \"Messiah\"; new Cantata, \"The\r\nSpectre's Bride\"; new Oratorio, \"The Three Holy Children.\"\r\n\r\n~Music Halls.~--Mr. Henry Holder is often said to have been the first\r\nwho opened a public room of this kind, but there had been one some years\r\nbefore at the George and Dragon, corner of Weaman Street, Steelhouse\r\nLane, which was both popular and respectably conducted.--See \"_Concert\r\nHalls_.\"\r\n\r\n~Musical Instruments.~--Our grandfathers and grandmothers were content\r\nwith their harps and harpsichords, their big and little fiddles, with\r\ntrumpets and drums, horns, oboes, bassoons, and pipes. Clarionets were\r\nnot introduced into the Festival bands until 1778; the double-bass\r\nkettle-drums came in 1784; trombones in 1790; flutes, with six or more\r\nkeys, were not known until 1802; serpents appeared in 1820; flageolets\r\nin 1823; the ophicleide was brought in 1829, and the monster specimens\r\nin 1834, which year also saw the introduction of the piccolo; the\r\nbombardon not coming until 1843. Pianofortes were first known in England\r\nin 1767, but when first played in Birmingham is uncertain; the first\r\ntime the instrument is named in a Festival programme was 1808, but the\r\nloan of a grand by Mr. Tomkinson, a London maker, in 1817, was an event\r\nthought deserving of a special vote of thanks.\r\n\r\n~Musical Notabilities~ of the highest calibre have been frequent\r\nvisitors here, at the Festivals and at the Theatres, though the\r\nnative-born sons of song who have attained high rank in the profession\r\nnumber but few. Under \"_Musical Festivals_\" appear the names of all the\r\nleading artistes who have taken part in those world-known performances,\r\nthe dates of their first appearances being only given, and in like\r\nmanner in the notice of our \"_Theatres_\" and \"_Theatrical Celebrities_\"\r\nwill be chronicled the advents of many celebrated \"stars\" who have trod\r\nour local boards. Considering the position he long held in the musical\r\nworld, the introduction of Sir Michael Costa to Birmingham has\r\nsufficient interest to be here noted. Signor Costa had been sent by his\r\nfriend Zingarelli to conduct his \"Cantata Sacra\" at the Festival of\r\n1829. The managers, however, thought so very little of the young\r\ngentleman's appearance (he was but nineteen) that they absolutely\r\nrefused him permission to do so, only allowing his expenses on condition\r\nthat he went among the singers. It was of no use his telling them that\r\nhe was a conductor and not a singer, and he had nervously to take the\r\npart assigned him. On returning to London, he quickly \"made his mark,\"\r\nand fell into his right place of honour and credit.\r\n\r\n~Musical Services.~--The first of a series of week-night musical\r\nservices for the people took place at St. Luke's Church, September 10,\r\n1877, the instruments used being the organ, two kettle-drums, two\r\ntrumpets, and two trombones. This was by no means an original idea, for\r\nthe followers of Swedenborg had similar services as well in their Chapel\r\nin Paradise Street (on site of Queen's College), as in Newhall Street\r\nand Summer Lane.\r\n\r\n~Mysteries of Past History.~--It was believed that a quantity of arms\r\nwere provided here by certain gentlemen favourable to the Pretender's\r\ncause in 1745, and that on the rebels failing to reach Birmingham, the\r\nsaid arms were buried on the premises of a certain manufacturer, who for\r\nthe good of his health fled to Portugal. The fact of the weapons being\r\nhidden came to the knowledge of the Government some sixty years after,\r\nand a search for them was intended, but though the name of the\r\nmanufacturer was found in the rare books of the period, and down to\r\n1750, the site of his premises could not be ascertained, the street\r\naddresses not being inserted, only the quarter of the town, thus: \"T.\r\nS.---- Digbath quarter.\" The swords, &c., have remained undiscovered to\r\nthe present day.--M 10, 1864, while excavations were being made in the\r\nold \"Castle Yard,\" in High Street the skeletons of three human beings\r\nwere found in a huddled position about 2-1/2 ft. from the surface.--The\r\nOld Inkleys were noted for the peculiar character (or want thereof) of\r\nits inhabitants, though why they buried their dead beneath their cellar\r\nfloors must remain a mystery. On October 29, 1879, the skeleton of a\r\nfull-grown man was found underneath what had once been the site of a\r\nhouse in Court No. 25 of the Old Inkleys, where it must have lain at\r\nleast 20 years.\r\n\r\n~Nail Making.~--See \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Natural History~ and Microscopical Society was formed in January, 1858.\r\nThe first meeting of the Midland Union of Natural History,\r\nPhilosophical, and Archæological Societies and Field Clubs was held at\r\nthe Midland Institute, May 27, 1878.\r\n\r\n~Nechells.~--There is, or was, a year or two back, a very old house,\r\n\"Nechells Hall,\" still in existence, where at one period of their\r\nhistory, some of the Holte family resided.\r\n\r\n~Needless Alley~ is said to have been originally called Needles Alley\r\nfrom a pin and needle makers' shop there.\r\n\r\n~Nelson.~--Boulton struck a line medal in commemoration of the Battle of\r\nTrafalgar, and by permission of the Government gave one to every person\r\nwho took part in the action; flag-officers and commanders receiving\r\ncopies in gold, lieutenants, &c., in silver, and the men, bronze. Being\r\nstruck for this purpose only, and not for sale, the medal is very\r\nscarce.--See \"_Statues_.\"\r\n\r\n~New Hall.~--One of the residences of the Colmore family, demolished in\r\n1787, the advertisement announcing the sale of its materials appearing\r\nJuly 2 that year. It is generally believed that the house stood in exact\r\nline with Newhall Street, and at its juncture with Great Charles Street;\r\nthe houses with the steps to them showing that the site between, whereon\r\nthe Hall stood, was lowered after its clearance.\r\n\r\n~Newhall Hill.~--Famous for ever in our history for the gatherings which\r\nhave at times taken place thereon, the most important of which are those\r\nof 1819, July 12, to elect a \"representative\" who should _demand_\r\nadmittance to, and a seat in, the House of Commons, whether the Commons\r\nwould let him or no. For taking part in this meeting, George Edmonds,\r\nMajor Cartwright, and some others, were put on their trial. A \"true\r\nbill\" was found on August 9th, but the indictment being removed to\r\nKing's Bench, the trial did not take place till August 7, 1820, the\r\nsentence of 12 months' imprisonment being passed May 28, 1821.--In 1832,\r\nMay 14, nearly 200,000 persons present, Mr. Thomas Attwood presiding.\r\nThis is the meeting described as \"one of the most solemn spectacles ever\r\nseen in the world.\" when the whole mighty assemblage took the vow of the\r\nPolitical Union, to \"devote themselves and their children to their\r\ncountry's cause.\"--In 1833, May 20, at which the Government was censured\r\nfor passing a Coercian Bill for Ireland, for keeping on the window and\r\nhouse taxes, for not abolishing the Coin Laws, and for not allowing vote\r\nby ballot.\r\n\r\n~Newhall Lane~ was the original name for that part of Colmore Row\r\nsituate between Newhall Street and Livery Street.\r\n\r\n~New John Street~, for a long time, was considered the longest street in\r\nthe borough, being 1 mile and 200 yards long.\r\n\r\n~New Market Street.~--Some ground was set out here, years ago, for a\r\nmarket; hence the name.\r\n\r\n~Newspapers and Magazines.~--In 1719 there were many small \"sheets of\r\nnews\" published in London, but the imposition of a halfpenny stamp\r\nfinished the career of the majority. In 1797 a 3-1/2 d. stamp, and in\r\n1815 a 4d. stamp was required. In 1836 it was reduced to 1d., and in\r\n1855, after a long agitation, the newspaper duty was abolished\r\naltogether. About 1830 the trick of printing a calico sheet of news was\r\ntried, the letter of the law being that duty must be paid on\r\nnews_papers_, but the Somerset House people soon stopped it. In Oct.,\r\n1834, among many others, James Guest, Thomas Watts, and William\r\nPlastans, news-vendors of this town, were committed to Warwick Gaol fur\r\nthe offence of selling unstamped papers. In 1840, the total circulation\r\nof all the local papers did not reach 14,000 copies per week, a great\r\ncontrast to the present day, when one office alone sends out more than\r\n150,000 in the like time. During the Chartist agitation there were\r\nfrequently as many as 5,000 to 6,000 copies of Feargus O'Connor's\r\n_Northern Star_ sold here, and many hundreds a week of the _Weekly\r\nDispatch_, a great favourite with \"the people\" then. _Cacoethes\r\nscribendi_, or the scribbling itch, is a complaint many local people\r\nhave suffered from, but to give a list of all the magazines, newspapers,\r\njournals, and periodicals that have been published here is impossible.\r\nMany like garden flowers have bloomed, fruited, and lived their little\r\nday, others have proved sturdy plants and stood their ground for years,\r\nbut the majority only just budded into life before the cold frosts of\r\npublic neglect struck at their roots and withered them up, not a leaf\r\nbeing left to tell even the date of their death. Notes of a few are here\r\ngiven:--\r\n\r\n_Advertiser_.--First number appeared Oct. 10, 1833.\r\n\r\n_Argus_.--Started as a monthly Aug. 1, 1828.--See \"_Allday_\" under\r\n\"_Noteworthy Men_.\"\r\n\r\n_Aris's Gazette_.--The oldest of our present local papers was first\r\npublished Nov. 10, 1741. Like all other papers of that period, it was\r\nbut a dwarf in comparison with the present broad-sheet, and the whole of\r\nthe local news given in its first number was comprised in five lines,\r\nannouncing the celebration of Admiral Vernon's birthday. Its Founder,\r\nThos. Aris, died July 4, 1761. Since that date it had seen but few\r\nchanges in its proprietorship until 1872, when it was taken by a Limited\r\nLiability Company, its politics remaining staunchly Conservative. On May\r\n12th, 1862, it was issued as a daily, the Saturday's publication still\r\nbearing the old familiar name.\r\n\r\n_Athlete_.--First issued as the \"_Midland Athlete_,\" January, 1879.\r\n\r\n_Bazaar_.--A quarto serial of 1823-25.\r\n\r\n_Birmingham Magazine_.--A literary and scientific publication edited by\r\nRev. Hugh Hutton. First appeared in Nov. 1827, running only nine\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n_Brum_.--A so-called satirical, but slightly scurrilous, sheet issued in\r\n1869, for a brief period.\r\n\r\n_Central Literary Magazine_.--First No. in Jan. 1873.\r\n\r\n_Chronicle_.--First published in 1765 by Myles Swinney. who continued to\r\nedit the paper until his death in 1812. It was sold March 15, 1819, as\r\nwell as the type foundry which had been carried on by Mr. Swinney, a\r\nbusiness then noteworthy, as there was but one other of the kind in\r\nEngland out of London.\r\n\r\n_Daily Globe_.--A Conservative 1/2d. evening paper, commencing Nov. 17,\r\n1879, and dying Oct. 30, 1880.\r\n\r\n_Daily Mail_.--Evening 1/2d. paper; an offshoot from the _Daily Post_,\r\nand now printed on adjoining premises. First published Sept. 7, 1870.\r\n\r\n_Daily Post_.--First published Dec. 4, 1857, by the proprietors of the\r\n_Journal_. From the first it \"took\" well, and it is the leading daily\r\npaper of the Midland Counties.\r\n\r\n_Daily Press_.--The first daily paper issued in Birmingham appeared on\r\nMay 7, 1855. Like many other \"new inventions,\" however, it did not\r\nsucceed in making a firm footing and succumbed in November, 1858.\r\n\r\n_Dart_.--A well-conducted comic weekly paper. Commenced Oct. 28, 1876.\r\n\r\n_Edgbaston Advertiser_.--Published monthly by Mr. Thos. Britton,\r\nLadywood. As its name implies, this publication is more of the character\r\nof an advertising sheet than a newspaper, but it often contains choice\r\nliterary pieces which make it a favourite.\r\n\r\n_Edgbastonia_.--A monthly, full of quaint and curious notes, local\r\nbiographies, &c., issued by Mr. Eliezer Edwards, the well-known \"S.D.R.\"\r\nFirst sent out May, 1881.\r\n\r\n_Edmonds' Weekly Recorder_.--First published by George Edmonds, June 18,\r\n1819. It was alive in 1823, but date of last issue is uncertain.\r\n\r\n_German_.--A newspaper printed in the German language made its\r\nappearance here Aug. 7, 1866, but did not live long.\r\n\r\n_Graphic_.--A penny illustrated commenced Feb. 21, 1883, but its\r\ngrowth was not sufficiently _hardy_ to keep it alive more than two\r\n_summers_.\r\n\r\n_Gridiron_.--\"A grill for saints and sinners,\" according to No. 1 (June\r\n14, 1879), and if bitter biting personalities can be called fun, the\r\npublication was certainty an amusing one, so long as it lasted.\r\n\r\n_Hardware Lion_.--Rather a curious name for the monthly advertising\r\nsheet first published Dec., 1880, but it did not long survive.\r\n\r\n_Illustrated Midland News_.--The publication of this paper, Sept. 4,\r\n1869, was a spirited attempt by Mr. Joseph Hatton to rival the\r\n_Illustrated London News_; but the fates were against him, and the last\r\nnumber was that of March 11, 1871.\r\n\r\n_Inspector_.--A political sheet, which only appeared a few times in\r\n1815.\r\n\r\n_Iris_.--A few numbers of a literary magazine thus named were issued in\r\n1830.\r\n\r\n_Jabet's Herald_.--A weekly paper, published 1808, but not of long\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n_Journal_.--A paper with this name was published in 1733, but there are\r\nno files extant to show how long it catered for the public. A copy of\r\nits 18th number, Monday, May 21, 1733, a small 4to of 4 pages, with the\r\n1/2d. red stamp, is in the possession of the proprietors of the _Daily\r\nPost_, The _Journal_ of later days first appeared June 4 1825, and\r\ncontinued to be published as a Saturday weekly until 1873, when it was\r\nincorporated with the _Daily Post_.\r\n\r\n_Liberal Review_.--First number March 20, 1880, and a few numbers ended\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Looker-On_.--A quizzical critical sheet of theatrical items of the year\r\n1823.\r\n\r\n_Literary Phoenix_.--A miscellany of literary litter swept together by\r\nMr. Henry Hawkes in 1820, but soon dropped.\r\n\r\n_Lion_.--Another of the modern \"satirical\" shortlived sheets, started\r\nJan. 4, 1877.\r\n\r\n_Mercury.--The Birmingham Mercury and Warwickshire and Staffordshire\r\nAdvertiser_ was the title of newspaper of which the first copy was dated\r\nNovember 24, 1820. The title of _Mercury_ was revived in 1848. on the\r\n10th December of which year Mr. Wm. B. Smith brought out his paper of\r\nthat name. It commenced with _éclat_, but soon lost its good name, and\r\nultimately, after a lingering existence (as a daily at last), it died\r\nout August 24, 1857.\r\n\r\n_Middle School Mirror_.--A monthly, edited, written, and published by\r\nthe boys of the Middle School of King Edward the Sixth, shone forth in\r\nDecember, 1880.\r\n\r\n_Midland Antiquary_.--First numbtr for Oct., 1882. A well-edited\r\nchronicle of matters interesting to our \"Old Mortality\" boys.\r\n\r\n_Midland Counties Herald_.--First published July 26, 1836, by Messrs.\r\nWright and Dain. Its circulation, though almost gratuitous is extensive\r\nand from its high character as a medium for certain classes of\r\nadvertisements it occasionally has appeared in the novel shape of a\r\nnewspaper without any news, the advertisers taking up all the space.\r\n\r\n_Midland Echo_--Halfpenny evening paper, commenced Feb. 26, 1883, as an\r\nextra-superfine Liberal organ. Ceased to appear as a local paper early\r\nin 1885.\r\n\r\n_Midland Metropolitan Magazine_. This heavily-named monthly lasted just\r\none year, from Dec., 1852.\r\n\r\n_Midland Naturalist_.--Commenced Jan. 1, 1878.\r\n\r\n_Morning News_.--Daily paper, in politics a Nonconformist Liberal; first\r\npublished Jan. 2, 1871, under the editorship of George Dawson until the\r\nexpiration of 1873. On Aug. 16, 1875, it was issued as a morning and\r\nevening paper at 1/2d.; but the copy for May 27, 1876, contained its own\r\ndeath notice.\r\n\r\n_Mouse Trap_.--The title of a little paper of playful badinage, issued\r\nfor a month or two in the autumn of 1824.\r\n\r\n_Naturalists' Gazette_.--In Sept. 1882, the Birmingham naturalists began\r\na gazette of their own.\r\n\r\n_Old and New Birmingham_ was published in monthly parts, the first being\r\nissued June 1, 1878.\r\n\r\n_Owl_.--A weekly pennyworth of self-announced \"wit and wisdom\" first\r\nissued Jan. 30, 1879.\r\n\r\n_Penny Magazine_.--This popular periodical, the fore-runner of all the\r\ncheap literature of the day, may be said to have had a Birmingham\r\norigin, as it was first suggested to Charles Knight by Mr. M.D. Hill in\r\n1832.\r\n\r\n_Philanthropist_.--First published (as _The Reformer_) April 16, 1835,\r\nby Benjamin Hudson, 18, Bull Street; weekly, four pages, price 7d., but\r\nin the following September lowered to 4-1/2d., the stamp duty of 4d.\r\nbeing at that time reduced to 1d. In politics it was Liberal, and a\r\nstaunch supporter of the Dissenters, who only supported it for about two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n_Radical Times_.--Came into existence Sept. 30, 1876, but being too\r\nrabidly Radical, even for \"the 600,\" whose leading-strings it shirked,\r\nit did not thrive for long.\r\n\r\n_Register or Entertaining Museum_.--With the prefix of the town's name,\r\nthis monthly periodical lived one year from May 10, 1764. This was one\r\nof the earliest London-printed country papers, the only local portion\r\nbeing the outside pages, so that it suited for a number of places.\r\n\r\n_Reporter and Review_.--Principally devoted to the doings on the local\r\nstage, and published for a brief period during June, &c., 1823.\r\n\r\n_Saturday Evening Post_.--A weekly \"make-up\" from the _Daily Post_ (with\r\na few distinctive features) and came into being with that paper; price\r\n1-1/2d. Originally issued at noon on Saturday, but latterly it has\r\nappeared simultaneous with the _Daily_, and is known as the _Weekly\r\nPost_, its price lately having been reduced to 1d.\r\n\r\n_Saturday Night_.--First published, Sept. 30, 1882.\r\n\r\n_Saturday's Register_.--Another of George Edmunds' political papers,\r\nwhich appeared for a few months in 1820.\r\n\r\n_Spectator_.--A literary and dramatic monthly, of which seven parts were\r\npublished in 1824.\r\n\r\n_Sunday Echo_.--First number came out May 21, 1882.\r\n\r\n_Sunday Express_.--Started August, 1884, and died August, 1885.\r\n\r\n_Sunday Telegram_.--Started May, 1883.\r\n\r\n_Sunrise_.--Rose Nov. 18, 1882, at the price of one-halfpenny, and\r\nlasted a few weeks only.\r\n\r\n_Tattler_.--April 1817 saw the first appearance of this\r\ntittle-tattle-tale-telling monthly tease to all lovers of theatrical\r\norder, and August saw the last.\r\n\r\n_Theatrical Argus_.--Of May and following months of 1830. A\r\ntwo-penny-worth of hotch-potch, principally scandal.\r\n\r\n_Theatrical John Bull_.--Published in May, 1824, lasting for the season\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n_Theatrical Note Book_.--Rival to above in June, 1824, and going off the\r\nstage same time.\r\n\r\n_Town Crier_.--This respectable specimen of a local comic appeared first\r\nin September, 1861, and it deserves a long life, if only for keeping\r\nclear of scandal and scurrility.\r\n\r\n_Warwick and Staffordshire Journal_.--Though printed here, the town was\r\nnot thought capable of filling its columns; a little experience showed\r\nthe two counties to be as bad, and subscribers were tempted to buy by\r\nthe issue of an Illustrated Bible and Prayer Book sent out in parts with\r\nthe paper. The first No. was that of Aug. 20, 1737, and it continued\r\ntill the end of Revelations, a large number of copperplate engravings\r\nbeing given with the Bible, though the price of the paper was but 2d.\r\n\r\n_Weekly Mercury_.--Commenced November, 1884.\r\n\r\n_Weekly News_.--A weak attempt at a weekly paper, lasted from May to\r\nSeptember, 1882.\r\n\r\n~Newsrooms.~--The first to open a newsroom were Messrs. Thomson and\r\nWrightson, booksellers, who on Aug. 22, 1807, admitted the public to its\r\ntables. In 1825 a handsome newsroom was erected in Bennett's Hill, the\r\nsite of which was sold in 1858 for the County Court, previous to its\r\nremoval to Waterloo Street.\r\n\r\n~New Street~ once called \"Beast Market.\" was in Hutton's time approached\r\nfrom High Street through an archway, the rooms over being in his\r\noccupation. In 1817 there were several walled-in gardens on the\r\nBennett's Hill side of the street, and it is on record that one house at\r\nleast was let at the low rent of 5s. 6d. per week. The old \"Grapes\"\r\npublic-house was pulled down just after the Queen's visit, being the\r\nlast of the houses removed on account of the railway station. Though it\r\nhas long been the principal business street of the town, New street was\r\nat one time devoted to the ignoble purposes of a beast market, and where\r\nthe fair ladies of to-day lightly tread the flags when on shopping bent,\r\nthe swine did wait the butcher's knife. New Street is 561 yards in\r\nlength; between Temple Street and Bennett's Hill it is 46-1/2 feet wide,\r\nand near Worcester Street 65 ft. 4 in. wide.\r\n\r\n~Nonconformists.~--The so-called Act of Uniformity of 1602 deprived\r\nnearly 2,000 of the clergy of their livings, and a few of them came to\r\nBirmingham as a place of refuge, ministering among the Dissenters, who\r\nthen had no buildings for regular worship. There were many documents in\r\nthe lost Staunton Collection relating to some of these clergymen, who,\r\nhowever, did not find altogether comfortable quarters even here, one\r\nGeorge Long, M.D., who had fled from his persecutors in Staffordshire,\r\nfinding no peace in Birmingham, removed to Ireland; others, though they\r\ncame here by stealth to minister, had to reside in country parts. A\r\nCentral Nonconformist Committee was formed here March 3, 1870.\r\n\r\n~Nonjurors.~--Among the name of the Roman Catholics, or \"Non-jurors,\"\r\nwho refused to take the oath of allegiance to George I., appeared that\r\nof John Stych, of Birmingham, whose forfeited estate was, in 1715,\r\nvalued at £12.\r\n\r\n~Northfield.~--Four and a-half miles from Birmingham. There was a Church\r\nhere at the time of the Norman survey, and some traces of its Saxon\r\norigin, students of architecture said, could once be found in the\r\nancient doorway on the north side of the building. Some forty years ago\r\nthe psalmody of the congregation and choir received assistance from the\r\nmellifluous strains ground out of a barrel organ, which instrument is\r\nstill preserved as a curiosity by a gentleman of the neighbourhood. They\r\nhad an indelible way at one time of recording local proceedings in\r\nmatters connected with the Church here. The inscriptions on the six\r\nbells cast in 1730 being:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Treble.--We are now six, though once but five,\r\n  2nd.--Though against our casting some did strive,\r\n  3rd.--But when a day for meeting they did fix,\r\n  4th.--There appeared but nine against twenty-six.\r\n  5th.--Samuel Palmer and Thomas Silk Churchwardens.\r\n  Tenor.--Thomas Kettle and William Jervoise did contrive\r\n  To make us six that were but five.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Notable Offences.~--In olden days very heavy punishments were dealt out\r\nfor what we now think but secondary offences, three men being sentenced\r\nto death at the Assizes, held March 31, 1742, one Anstey for burglary,\r\nTownsend for sheep-stealing, and Wilmot for highway robbery. The laws\r\nalso took cognisance of what to us are strange crimes, a woman in 1790\r\nbeing imprisoned here for selling almanacks without the Government stamp\r\non them; sundry tradesmen also being heavily fined for dealing in\r\ncovered buttons. The following are a few other notable olfences that\r\nhave been chronicled for reference:--\r\n\r\n_Bigamy_.--The Rev. Thomas Morris Hughes was, Nov. 15, 1883, sentenced\r\nto seven years' penal servitude for this offence. He had been previously\r\npunished for making a false registration of the birth of a child, the\r\nmother of which was his own stepdaughter.\r\n\r\n_Burglary_.--On Christmas eve, 1800, five men broke into the\r\ncounting-house at Soho, stealing therefrom 150 guineas and a lot of\r\nsilver, but Matthew Boulton captured four of them, who were\r\ntransported.--The National School at Handsworth, was broken into and\r\nrobbed for the fifth time Sept. 5, 1827.--A warehouse in Bradford Street\r\nwas robbed Jan. 9, 1856, of an iron safe, weighing nearly 4cwt., and\r\ncontaining £140 in cash.--A burglary was committed in the Ball Ring,\r\nJuly 5, 1862, for which seven persons were convicted.\r\n\r\n_Coining_.--Booth, the noted coiner and forger, was captured at Perry\r\nBarr, March 28, 1812, his house being surrounded by constables and\r\nsoldiers. In addition to a number of forged notes and £600 in\r\ncounterfeit silver, the captors found 200 guineas in gold and nearly\r\n£3,000 in good notes, but they did not save Booth Irom being hanged.\r\nBooth had many hidingplaces for his peculiar productions, parcels of\r\nspurious coins having several times been found in hedgerow banks and\r\nelsewhere; the latest find (in April, 1884) consisted of engraved\r\ncopper-plates for Bank of England £1 and £2 notes.--There have been\r\nhundreds of coiners punished since his day. The latest trick is getting\r\nreally good dies for sovereigns, for which Ingram Belborough, an old man\r\nof three score and six, got seven years' penal servitude, Nov, 15 1883.\r\n\r\n_Deserters_.--On 24 July, 1742, a soldier deserted from his regiment in\r\nthis town. Followed, and resisting, he was shot at Tettenhall Wood.--A\r\nsergeant of the Coldstream Guards was shot here while trying to capture\r\na deserter, September 13, 1796.\r\n\r\n_Dynamite making_.--One of the most serious offences committed in\r\nBirmingham was discovered when Alfred Whitehead was arrested April 5,\r\n1883, on the charge of manufacturing nitroglycerine, or dynamite, at\r\n128, Ledsam Street. Whitehead was one of the Irish-American or\r\nAmerican-Irish party of the Land Leaguers or Home Rulers, who entertain\r\nthe idea that by committing horrible outrages in England. they will\r\nsucceed in making Ireland \"free from the galling yoke of Saxon tyranny\"\r\nand every Irishman independent of everybody and everything everywhere.\r\nWell supplied with funds from New York, Whitehead quietly arranged his\r\nlittle manufactory, buying glycerine from one firm and nitric and\r\nsulphuric acids from others, certain members of the conspiracy coming\r\nfrom London to take away the stuff when it was completely mixed. The\r\ndeliveries of the peculiar ingredients attracted the attention of Mr.\r\nGilbert Pritchard, whose chemical knowledge led him to guess what they\r\nwere required for; he informed his friend, Sergeant Price, of his\r\nsuspicions; Price and his superior officers made nightly visits to\r\nLedsam Street, getting into the premises, and taking samples for\r\nexamination; and on the morning named Whitehead's game was over, though\r\nnot before he had been watched in sending off two lots of the\r\ndangerously explosive stuff to London. There was, however, no less than\r\n200lbs weight found still on the premises. The men who carried it to\r\nLondon were quickly caught with the dynamite in their possession, and\r\nwith Whitehead were brought to trial and each of them sentenced to penal\r\nservitude for life. The distribution of rewards in connection with the\r\n\"dynamite outrages,\" so far as Birmingham people were concerned, was\r\nsomewhat on a similar scale to that described by the old sailor, when he\r\nsaid \"prize-money\" was distributed through a ladder, all passing through\r\ngoing to the officers, while any sticking to the wood was divided among\r\nthe men. Mr. Farndale, the Chief of Police, was granted an addition to\r\nhis salary of £100 per year; Inspector Black was promoted to the rank of\r\nSuperintendent, adding £50 a year to his salary, and was presented with\r\n£100 from Government; Sergeant Price, became Inspector, with a rise of\r\n£41 12s. a year, and received a bonus of £200; Inspector Rees' salary\r\nwas raised to two guineas a week, with a gift, of £50: while Mr.\r\nPritchard, to whom belonged the conspicuous service of having given the\r\ninformation which led the police to act, was rewarded (!) with £50,\r\nhaving lost his situation through his services to the public.\r\n\r\n_Embezzlements_.--In 1871, W. Harrison, the Secretary of the Birmingham\r\nGas Company, skedaddled, his books showing defalcations to the amount of\r\n£18,000. When the company was dissolved, £100 was left in a bank for Mr.\r\nSecretary's prosecution, should he return to this country.--July 12,\r\n1877, the secretary of the Moseley Skating Rink Company was awarded\r\ntwelve months, and the secretary of the Butcher's Hide and Skin Company\r\nsix months, for similar offences, but for small amounts.\r\n\r\n_Forgeries_.--In the year 1800, seven men were hung at Warwick for\r\nforgery, and with them one for sheep-stealing. The manufacture of forged\r\nbank-notes was formerly quite a business here, and many cases are on\r\nrecord of the detection and punishment of the offenders.--June 28, 1879.\r\nthe Joint Stock Bank were losers of £2,130 through cashing three forged\r\ncheques bearing the signature of W.C.B. Cave, the clever artist getting\r\nten years--Nov. 15, 1883. John Alfred Burgan, manager of the Union Bank,\r\nfor forging and uttering a certain order, and falsifying his books, the\r\namounts embezzled reaching £9,000, was sentenced to fifteen years' penal\r\nservitude.--On the previous day Benjamin Robert Danks was similarly\r\npunished for forgeries on his employer, Mr. Jesse Herbert, barrister,\r\nwho had been exceedingly kind to him--Zwingli Sargent, solicitor, was\r\nsentenced to five years' penal servitude, April 28, 1885, for forgery\r\nand misappropriating money belonging to clients.\r\n\r\n_Fortunetelling_ is still far from being an uncommon offence, but\r\n\"Methratton,\" the \"Great Seer of England,\" _alias_ John Harewell, who,\r\non March 28, 1883, was sentenced to nine months hard labour, must rank\r\nas being at the top of the peculiar profession. Though a \"Great Seer\" he\r\ncould not foresee his own fate.\r\n\r\n_Highwaymen_.--The \"gentlemen of the road\" took their tolls in a very\r\nfree manner in the earlier coaching days, notwithstanding that the\r\npunishment dealt out was frequently that of death or, in mild cases,\r\ntransportation for life. The Birmingham stage coach was stopped and\r\nrobbed near Banbury, May 18, 1743, by two highwaymen, who, however, were\r\ncaptured same day, and were afterwards hung.--Mr. Wheeley, of Edgbaston,\r\nwas stopped in a lane near his own house, and robhed of 20 guineas by a\r\nfootpad, May 30, 1785.--An attempt to rob and murder Mr. Evans was made\r\nnear Aston Park, July 25, 1789.--Henry Wolseley, Esq. (third son of Sir\r\nW. Wolseley, Bart.), was robbed by high-waymen near Erdington, Nov. 5,\r\n1793.--Some highwaymen robbed a Mr. Benton of £90 near Aston Brook,\r\nApril 6, 1797.--The coach from Sheffield was stopped by footpads near\r\nAston Park, March 1, 1798, and the passengers robbed.--The \"Balloon\"\r\ncoach was robbed of £8,000, Dec. 11, 1822, and the Warwick mail was\r\nrobbed of no less than £20,000 in bank notes, Nov. 28. 1827.\r\n\r\n_Horrible_.--The bodies of eleven children were found buried at back of\r\n68, Long Acre, Nechells, where lived Ann Pinson, a midwife, who _said_\r\nthey were all still-born, July, 1878.\r\n\r\n_Long Firms_.--A term applied to rogues, who, by pretending to be in\r\nbusiness, procure goods by wholesale, and dispose of them fraudulently.\r\nW.H. Stephenson, of this town, a great patron of these gentry, was\r\nsentenced to seven years' penal servitude, Nov. 22, 1877, for the part\r\nhe had taken in one of these swindling transactions, according to\r\naccount by far from being the first of the kind he had had a hand in.\r\n\r\n_Next-of-Kin Frauds_.--Many good people imagine they are entitled to\r\nproperty now in other hands, or laid up in Chancery, and to accommodate\r\ntheir very natural desire to obtain information that would lead to their\r\ngetting possession of same, a \"Next-of-Kin Agency\" was opened in\r\nBurlington Passage at the beginning of 1882. The _modus operandi_ was of\r\nthe simplest: the firm advertised that Brown, Jones, and Robinson were\r\nwanted; Brown, Jones, and Robinson turned up, and a good many of them;\r\nthey paid the enquiry fees, and called again. They were assured (every\r\nman Jack of them) they were right owners, and all they had to do was to\r\ninstruct the firm to recover. More fees, and heavy ones; the Court must\r\nbe petitioned--more fees; counsel engaged--more fees; case entered for\r\nhearing--more fees, and so on, as long as the poor patients would stand\r\nbleeding. Several instances were known of people selling their goods to\r\nmeet the harpies' demands; clergymen and widows, colliers and\r\nwasher-women, all alike were in the net. It became too hot at last, and\r\nRogers, Beeton and Co., were provided with berths in the gaol. At\r\nManchester Assizes July 18, 1882, J.S. Rogers got two years' hard\r\nlabour, A. Mackenzie and J.H. Shakespear (a solicitor) each 21 months;\r\nand E.A. Beeton, after being in gaol six months, was ordered to stop a\r\nfurther twelve, the latter's conviction being from this town.\r\n\r\n_Novel Thefts_.--A youth of nineteen helped himself to £128 from a safe\r\nat General Hospital, and spent £13 of it before the magistrates (Jan.\r\n15, 1875) could give him six months' lodgings at the gaol.--Three\r\npolicemen were sent to penal servitude for five years for thieving July\r\n8, 1876.--Sept. 19, 1882, some labourers engaged in laying sewage pipes\r\nnear Newton Street, Corporation Street, came across some telegraph\r\ncables, and under the impression that they were \"dead\" wires, hitched a\r\nhorse thereto and succeeded in dragging out about a dozen yards of no\r\nless than 33 different cables connecting this town with Ireland, the\r\nContinent, and America. Their prize was sold for 4s. 6d., but the\r\ninconvenience caused was very serious. Henry Jones, who was tried for\r\nthe trick, pleaded ignorance, and was let off.--At Quarter Sessions,\r\nErnest Lotze, got six months for stealing, Dec. 12, 1892, from his\r\nemployer 87lb. weight of human hair, valued at £300.\r\n\r\n_Personal Outrages_.--Maria Ward was sentenced to penal servitude\r\nDecember 18, 1873, for mutilating her husband in a shocking manner.--At\r\nWarwick Assizes, December 19, 1874, one man was sentenced to 15 years,\r\nand four others to 7 years' penal servitude for outraging a woman in\r\nShadwell Street.--George Moriarty, plasterer, pushed his wife through\r\nthe chamber window, and on her clinging to the ledge beat her hands with\r\na hammer till she fell and broke her leg, May 31, 1875. It was three\r\nmonths before she could appear against him, and he had then to wait\r\nthree months for his trial, which resulted in a twenty years' sentence.\r\n\r\n_Sacrilege_.--In 1583 St. Martin's Church was robbed of velvet \"paul\r\ncloathes,\" and also some money belonging to the Grammar School.--\r\nHandsworth Church was robbed of its sacramental plate, February 10,\r\n1784; and Aston Church was similarly despoiled, April 21, 1788.--A gross\r\nsacrilege was commuted in Edgbaston Church, December 15, 1816.--Four\r\nChurches were broken into on the night of January 3, 1873.\r\n\r\n_Sedition and Treason_.--George Ragg, printer, was imprisoned for\r\nsedition, February 12, 1821.--George Thompson, gun maker, 31, Whittall\r\nStreet, was imprisoned, August 7, 1839, for selling guns to the\r\nChartists.\r\n\r\n_Shop Robberies_.--Diamonds worth £400 were stolen from Mr. Wray's shop,\r\nNovember 27, 1872.--A jeweller's window in New Street was smashed\r\nJanuary 23, 1875, the damage and loss amounting to £300.--A bowl\r\ncontaining 400 \"lion sixpences\" was stolen from Mr. Thomas's window, in\r\nNew Street, April 5, 1878.--Mr. Mole's jeweller's shop, High Street, was\r\nplundered of £500 worth, April 13th, 1881. Some of the works of the\r\nwatches taken were afterwards fished up from the bottom of the Mersey,\r\nat Liverpool.\r\n\r\n_Short Weight_.--Jan. 2, 1792, there was a general \"raid\" made on the\r\ndealers in the market, when many short-weight people came to grief.\r\n\r\n_Street Shouting_.--The Watch Committee passed a bye-law, May 14, 1878,\r\nto stop the lads shouting \"_Mail, Mail_,\" but they go on doing it.\r\n_Swindles_.--Maitland Boon Hamilton, a gentleman with a cork leg, was\r\ngiven six months on July 25, 1877, for fleecing Mr. Marsh, the jeweller,\r\nout of some diamonds.--James Bentley, for the \"Christmas hamper\r\nswindle,\" was sentenced to seven years at the Quarter Sessions, May 1,\r\n1878.\r\n\r\nThe following tables show the number of offences dealt with by the\r\nauthorities during the five years ending with 1882 (the charges, of\r\nwhich only a small number have been reported, being omitted):--\r\n\r\nThe total number of crimes reported under the head of \"indictable\r\noffences\"--namely, Sessions and Assizes cases--the number apprehended,\r\nand how dealt with, will be gathered from the following summary:--\r\n\r\n\r\nYear.

In the borough 734 males and\r\n198 females had been committed for felony, 1,040 males and 290 females\r\nfor misdemeanour, 707 males and 329 females for drunkenness, and 243\r\nmales and 121 females for vagrancy. Of prisoners sixteen years old and\r\nunder there were 193 males and 21 females.\r\n\r\n~Noteworthy Men of the Past.~--Though in the annals of Birmingham\r\nhistory the names of very many men of note in art, science, and\r\nliterature, commerce and politics, are to be found, comparatively\r\nspeaking there are few of real native origin. Most of our best men have\r\ncome from other parts, as will be seen on looking over the notices which\r\nfollow this. Under the heading of \"_Parsons, Preachers, and Priests_,\"\r\nwill be found others of different calibre.\r\n\r\n_Allday_.--The \"Stormy Petrel\" of modern Birmingham was Joseph, or, as\r\nhe was better known, Joey Allday, whose hand at one time, was against\r\nevery man, and every man's hand against Joe. Born in 1798, Mr. Allday,\r\non arriving at years of maturity, joined his brothers in the\r\nwire-drawing business, but though it _is_ a painful sight to see (as Dr.\r\nWatts says) children of one family do very often disagree, even if they\r\ndo not fall out and chide and fight; but Joseph was fond of fighting\r\n(though not with his fists), and after quarelling and dissolving\r\npartnership, as one of his brothers published a little paper so must he.\r\nThis was in 1824, and Joey styled his periodical _The Mousetrap_,\r\nfooting his own articles with the name of \"Argus.\" How many _Mousetraps_\r\nAllday sent to market is uncertain, as but one or two copies only are\r\nknown to be in existence, and equally uncertain is it whether the\r\nspeculation was a paying one. His next literary notion, however, if not\r\npecuniarily successful, was most assuredly popular, as well as\r\nnotorious, it being the much-talked-of _Argus_. The dozen or fifteen\r\nyears following 1820 were rather prolific in embryo publications and\r\nperiodicals of one kind and another, and it is a matter of difficulty to\r\nascertain now the exact particulars respecting many of them. Allday's\r\nventure, which was originally called _The Monthly Argus_, first saw the\r\nlight in August, 1828. and, considering the times, it was a tolerably\r\nwell-conducted sheet of literary miscellany, prominence being given to\r\nlocal theatrical matters and similar subjects, which were fairly\r\ncriticised. Ten numbers followed, in due monthly order, but the volume\r\nfor the year was not completed, as in July, 1830, a new series of _The\r\nArgus_ was commenced in Magazine shape and published at a shilling. The\r\neditor of this new series had evidently turned over a new leaf, but he\r\nmust have done so with a dungfork, for the publication became nothing\r\nbetter than the receptacle of rancour, spite, and calumny, public men\r\nand private individuals alike being attacked, and often in the most\r\nscurrilous manner. The printer (who was still alive a few years back)\r\nwas William Chidlow and on his head, of course, fell all the wrath of\r\nthe people libelled and defamed. George Frederick Mantz horse whipped\r\nhim, others sued him for damages, and even George Edmonds (none too\r\ntender-tongued himself) could not stand the jibes and jeers of _The\r\nArgus_. The poor printer was arrested on a warrant for libel; his types\r\nand presses were confiscated under a particular section of the Act for\r\nregulating newspapers, and Allday himself at the March Assizes in 1831\r\nwas found guilty on several indictments for libel, and sentenced to ten\r\nmonths' imprisonment. A third series of _The Argus_ was started June\r\n1st, 1832, soon after Allday's release from Warwick, and as the vile\r\nscurrility of the earlier paper was abandoned to a great extent, it was\r\npermitted to appear as long as customers could be found to support it,\r\nultimately dying out with the last month of 1834. To Mr. Joseph Allday\r\nmust credit be given for the exposure of numerous abuses existing in his\r\nday. He had but to get proper insight into anything going on wrong than\r\nhe at once attacked it, tooth and nail, no matter who stood in the road,\r\nor who suffered from his blows. His efforts to put a stop to the\r\ncruelties connected with the old system of imprisonment and distraint\r\nfor debt led to the abolition of the local Courts of Requests; and his\r\nwrathful indignation on learning the shocking manner in which prisoners\r\nat the goal were treated by the Governor, Lieutenant Austin, in 1852-53,\r\nled to the well-remembered \"Gaol Atrocity Enquiry,\" and earned for him\r\nthe thanks of the Commissioners appointed by Government to make the\r\nenquiry. As a Town Councillor and Alderman, as a Poor Law Guardian and\r\nChairman of the Board, as Parish Warden for St. Martin's and an opponent\r\nof churchrates (while being a good son of Mother Church), as founder of\r\nthe Ratepayers' Protection Society and a popular leader of the\r\nConservative party, it needs not saying that Mr. Allday had many enemies\r\nat all periods of his life, but there were very few to speak ill of him\r\nat the time of his death, which resulted from injuries received in a\r\nfall on Oct. 2nd, 1861.\r\n\r\n_Allen_, J.--Local portrait painter of some repute from 1802 to 1820.\r\n\r\n_Aston_, John, who died Sept. 12, 1882, in his 82nd year, at one time\r\ntook a leading share in local affairs. He was High Bailiff in 1841, a\r\nJ.P. for the county, for 40 years a Governor of the Grammar School, and\r\non the boards of management of a number of religious and charitable\r\ninstitutions. A consistent Churchman, he was one of the original\r\ntrustees of the \"Ten Churches Fund,\" one of the earliest works of church\r\nextension in Birmingham; he was also the chief promoter of the Church of\r\nEngland Cemetery, and the handsome church of St. Michael, which stands\r\nin the Cemetery grounds, was largely due to his efforts. In polities Mr.\r\nAston was a staunch Conservative, and was one of the trustees of the\r\nonce notable Constitutional Association.\r\n\r\n_Attwood_.--The foremost name of the days of Reform, when the voice of\r\nLiberal Birmingham made itself heard through its leaders was that of\r\nThomas Attwood. A native of Salop, born Oct. 6, 1783, he became a\r\nresident here soon after coming of age, having joined Messrs. Spooner's\r\nBank, thence and afterwards known as Spooner and Attwood's. At the early\r\nage of 28 he was chosen High Bailiff, and soon made his mark by opposing\r\nthe renewal of the East India Co.'s charter, and by his exertions to\r\nobtain the withdrawal of the \"Orders in Council,\" which in 1812, had\r\nparalysed the trade of the country with America. The part he took in the\r\ngreat Reform meetings, his triumphant reception after the passing of the\r\nBill, and his being sent to Parliament as one of the first\r\nrepresentatives for the borough, are matters which have been too many\r\ntimes dilated upon to need recapitulation. Mr. Attwood had peculiar\r\nviews on the currency question, and pertinaciously pressing them on his\r\nfellow members in the House of Commons he was not liked, and only held\r\nhis seat until the end of Dec., 1839, the last prominent act of his\r\npolitical life being the presentation of a monster Chartist petition in\r\nthe previous June. He afterwards retired into private life, ultimately\r\ndying at Malvern, March 6 1856, being then 73 years of age. Charles\r\nAttwood, a brother, but who took less part in politics, retiring from\r\nthe Political Union when he thought Thomas and his friends were verging\r\non the precipice of revolution, was well known in the north of England\r\niron and steel trade. He died Feb. 24, 1875, in his 84th year. Another\r\nbrother Benjamin, who left politics alone, died Nov. 22, 1874, aged 80.\r\nNo greater contrast could possibly be drawn than that shown in the\r\ncareer of these three gentlemen. The youngest brother who industriously\r\nattended to his business till he had acquired a competent fortune, also\r\ninherited enormous wealth from a nephew, and after his death he was\r\nproved to have been the long un-known but much sought after anonymous\r\ndonor of the £1,000 notes so continuously acknowledged in the _Times_ as\r\nhaving been sent to London hospitals and charities. It was said that\r\nBenjamin Attwood distributed nearly £350,000 in this unostentatious\r\nmanner, and his name will be ever blessed. Charles Attwood was described\r\nas a great and good man, and a benefactor to his race. His discoveries\r\nin the manufacture of glass and steel, and his opening up of the\r\nCleveland iron district, has given employment to thousands, and as one\r\nwho knew him well said, \"If he had cared more about money, and less\r\nabout science, he could have been one of the richest commoners in\r\nEngland;\" but he was unselfish, and let other reap the benefit of his\r\nbest patents. What the elder brother was, most Brums know; he worked\r\nhard in the cause of Liberalism, he was almost idolised here, and his\r\nstatue stands not far from the site of the Bank with which his name was\r\nunfortunately connected, and the failure of which is still a stain on\r\nlocal commercial history.\r\n\r\n_Baldwin_, James.--Born in the first month of the present century, came\r\nhere early in his teens, worked at a printer's, saved his money, an\r\nemployer at 25, made a speciality of \"grocer's printing,\" fought hard in\r\nthe battle against the \"taxes on knowledge,\" became Alderman and Mayor,\r\nand ultimately settled down on a farm near his own paper mills at King's\r\nNorton, where, Dec. 10, 1871, he finished a practically useful life,\r\nregretted by many.\r\n\r\n_Bayley_, C.H.--A Worcestershire man and a Staffordshire resident; a\r\npersevering collector of past local and county records, and an active\r\nmember of the Archæological section of the Midland Institute. Mr. Bayley\r\nwas also a member of the Staffordshire Archæological Society, and took\r\nspecial interest in the William Salt Library at Stafford, whose\r\ntreasures were familiar to him, and whose contents he was ever ready to\r\nsearch and report on for any of his friends. In 1869 he issued the first\r\nof some proposed reprints of some of his own rarities, in \"A True\r\nRelation of the Terrible Earthquake at West Brummidge, in\r\nStaffordshire,\" &c., printed in 1676; and early in 1882 (the year of his\r\ndeath) \"The Rent Rolls of Lord Dudley and Ward in 1701\"--a very curious\r\ncontribution to local history, and full of general interest also.\r\n\r\n_Beale_, Samuel.--At one period a most prominent man among our local\r\nworthies, one of the first Town Councillors, and Mayor in 1841. He was\r\nChairman of the Midland Railway, a director of the Birmingham and\r\nMidland Bank, and sat as M.P. for Derby from 1857 to 1865. He died Sept\r\n11 1876, aged 71.\r\n\r\n_Beale_, W.J.--A member of the legal firm of Beale, Marigold, and Beale.\r\nMr. Beale's chief public service was rendered in connection with the\r\nGeneral Hospital and the Musical Festivals. He was for many years a\r\nmember of the Orchestral Committee of the Festivals, and in 1870 he\r\nsucceeded Mr. J.0. Mason as chairman; retaining this position until\r\nafter the Festival of 1876. His death took place in July, 1880, he then\r\nbeing in his 76th year.\r\n\r\n_Billing_, Martin.--Founder of the firm of Martin Billing, Sons, & Co.,\r\nLivery Street, died July 17, 1883, at the age of 71. He commenced life\r\nunder his uncle, Alderman Baldwin, and was the first to introduce steam\r\nprinting machines into Birmingham. The colossal structure which faces\r\nthe Great Western Railway Station was erected about twenty-nine years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n_Bisset_, James, was the publisher of the \"Magnificent Directory\" and\r\n\"Poetic Survey\" of Birmingham, presented to the public, January 1, 1800.\r\n\r\n_Bowly_ E.0.--A native, self-taught artist, whose pictures now fetch\r\nrapidly-increasing sums, though for the best part of his long life\r\ndealers and the general run of art patrons, while acknowledging the\r\nexcellence of the works, would not buy them. Mr. Bowly, however, lived\r\nsufficiently long to know that the few gentlemen who honoured him in his\r\nyounger years, were well recompensed for their kind recognition of his\r\ntalent, though it came too late to be of service to himself. His death\r\noccurred Feb. 1, 1876, in his 70th year.\r\n\r\n_Briggs_.--Major W.B. Briggs, who was struck off the world's roster Jan.\r\n25, 1877, was one of the earliest and most ardent supporters of the\r\nVolunteer movement in Birmingham, being gazetted ensign of the 2nd\r\nCompany in November, 1859. He was a hearty kindly man, and much esteemed\r\nin and out of the ranks.\r\n\r\n_Burritt_ Elihu, the American \"learned blacksmith,\" having made himself\r\nproficient in fifteen different languages. He first addressed the\r\n\"Friends of Peace\" in this town, Dec. 15, 1846, when on a tour through\r\nthe country. He afterwards returned, and resided in England for nearly\r\ntwenty-five years, being for a considerable time United States Consul at\r\nBirmingham, which he left in 1868. During his residence here he took an\r\nactive share in the work of diffusing the principles of temperance and\r\npeace, both by lecturing and by his writings.\r\n\r\n_Bynner_, Henry.--A native of the town; forty-five years British Consul\r\nat Trieste; returned here in 1842, and died in 1867. He learned\r\nshorthand writing of Dr. Priestley, and was the first to use it in a law\r\ncourt in this county.\r\n\r\n_Cadbury_, Richard Tapper.--A draper and haberdasher, who started\r\nbusiness here in 1794. One of the Board of Guardians, and afterwards\r\nChairman (for 15 years) of the Commissioners of the Streets, until that\r\nbody was done away with. Mr. Cadbury was one of the most respected and\r\nbest known men of the town. He died March 13, 1860, in his 92nd year,\r\nbeing buried in Bull Street, among his departed friends.\r\n\r\n_Capers_, Edward.--Sometimes called the \"poet-postman,\" is a Devonshire\r\nman, but resided for a considerable time at Harborne. He deserves a\r\nplace among our noteworthy men, if only for his sweet lines on the old\r\nLove lane at Edgbaston, now known as Richmond Hill.\r\n\r\n  \"But no vestige of the bankside lingers now\r\n     or gate to show\r\n  The track of the old vanished lane of love's\r\n     sweet long ago.\"\r\n\r\n_Carey_, Rev. Henry Francis, a native of this town (born in 1772),\r\nvicar of Bromley Abbots, Staffordshire, himself a poet of no mean order,\r\ntranslated in blank verse Dante's \"Inferno,\" the \"Divina Commedia,\" &c.,\r\nhis works running rapidly through several editions. For some time he was\r\nassistant librarian at the British Museum, and afterwards received a\r\npension of £200 a year. Died in 1844, and lies in \"Poet's Corner,\"\r\nWestminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n_Chamberlain_, John Henry.--Came to Birmingham in 1856, and died\r\nsuddenly on the evening of Oct. 22, 1883, after delivering a lecture in\r\nthe Midland Institutes on \"Exotic Art.\" An architect of most brilliant\r\ntalent, it is almost impossible to record the buildings with which (in\r\nconjunction with his partner, Mr. Wm. Martin) he has adorned our town.\r\nAmong them are the new Free Libraries, the extension of the Midland\r\nInstitute, the Hospitals for Women and Children, the many Board Schools,\r\nthe Church of St. David, and that at Selly Hill the Rubery Asylum, the\r\nFire Brigade Station, the Constitution Hill Library, Monument Lane\r\nBaths, the Chamberlain Memorial, the Canopy over Dawson's Statue,\r\nseveral Police Stations, with shops and private houses innumerable. He\r\nwas a true artist in every sense of the word, an eloquent speaker, and\r\none of the most sincere, thoughtful, and lovingly-earnest men that\r\nBirmingham has ever been blessed with.\r\n\r\n_Clegg_.--Samuel Clegg was born at Manchester, March 2, 1781, but his\r\nearly years were passed at the Soho Works, where he was assistant to Mr.\r\nMurdoch in the gradual introduction of lighting with gas. In 1807 Mr.\r\nClegg first used lime as a purifier and in 1815 he patented the water\r\nmeter. In addition to his many inventions connected with the manufacture\r\nand supply of gas, Mr. Clegg must be credited with the introduction of\r\nthe atmospheric railways, which attracted so much attention some\r\nfive-and-forty years ago, and also with many improvements in steam\r\nengines.\r\n\r\n_Collins_.--Mr. John Collins, an exceedingly popular man in his day, and\r\nquite a local author, made his first appearance here Jan. 16, 1793, at\r\n\"The Gentlemen's Private Theatre,\" in Livery Street, with an\r\nentertainment called \"Collins' New Embellished Evening Brush, for\r\nRubbing off the Rust of care.\" This became a great favourite, and we\r\nfind Collins for years after, giving similar performances, many of them\r\nbeing for the purpose of paying for \"soup for the poor\" in the\r\ndistressful winters of 1799, 1800, and 1801. Not so much, however, on\r\naccount of his charity, or his unique entertainment, must Mr. Collins be\r\nranked among local worthies, as for \"A Poetical History of Birmingham\"\r\nwritten (or rather partly written) by him, which was published in\r\n_Swinney's Chronicle_. Six chapters in verse appeared (Feb. 25 to April\r\n7, 17[**]6), when unfortunately the poet's muse seems to have failed\r\nhim. As a sample of the fun contained in the seven or eight dozen\r\nverses, we quote the first--\r\n\r\n  \"Of Birmingham's name, tho' a deal has been said,\r\n    Yet a little, we doubt, to the purpose,\r\n  As when \"hocus pocus\" was jargon'd instead\r\n    Of the Catholic text \"_hoc est corpus_.\"\r\n\r\n  For it, doubtless, for ages was Bromwicham called,\r\n    But historians, their readers to bam,\r\n  Have Brom, Wich, and Ham so corrupted and maul'd,\r\n    That their strictures have all proved a sham.\r\n\r\n  That Brom implies Broom none will dare to deny,\r\n    And that Wich means a Village or Farm;\r\n  Or a Slope, or a Saltwork, the last may imply,\r\n    And to read Ham for Town is no harm.\r\n\r\n  But when jumbled together, like stones in a bag,\r\n    To make it a Broom-sloping town,\r\n  Credulity's pace at such juggling must flag,\r\n    And the critic indignant will frown.\r\n\r\n  Tis so much like the Gazetteer's riddle-my-ree,\r\n    Who, untwisting Antiquity's cable,\r\n  Makes Barnstaple's town with its name to agree,\r\n    Take its rise from a Barn and a Stable.\"\r\n\r\nCollins' own comical notion gives the name as \"Brimmingham,\" from the\r\nbrimming goblets so freely quaffed by our local sons of Vulcan. Digbeth\r\nhe makes out to be a \"dug bath,\" or horsepond for the farriers;\r\nDeritend, from _der_ (water).\r\n\r\n  \"Took its name from the swamp where the hamlet was seated,\r\n   And imply'd 'twas the water-wet-end of the town.\"\r\n\r\n_Cox_, David--On the 29th of April, 1783, this great painter--the man\r\nwhose works have made Birmingham famous in art--was born in a humble\r\ndwelling in Heath Mill Lane, Deritend, where his father carried on the\r\ntrade of a smith. Some memorials of him we have--in the noble gift of a\r\nnumber of his pictures in oil, presented to the town by the late Mr.\r\nJoseph Nettlefold; in the portrait by Mr. J. Watson Gordon, and the bust\r\nby Mr. Peter Hollins; in the two biographies of him--both of them\r\nBirmingham works--the earlier by Mr. Neal Solly, and the more recent one\r\nby the late Mr. William Hall; besides the memorial window put up by\r\nloving friends in the Parish Church of Harborne, where the latter part\r\nof the artist's life was passed, and in the churchyard of which his\r\nremains were laid. He bade his pictures and the world good-bye on the\r\n9th of June, 1859. A sale of some of \"dear old David's\" works, in\r\nLondon, May, 1873, realised for the owners over £25,000, but what the\r\nartist himself originally had for them may be gathered from the instance\r\nof his \"Lancaster Castle,\" otherwise known as \"Peace and War,\" a\r\nharvest-field scene, with troops marching by, only 24in. by 18in. in\r\nsize. This picture he gave to a friend at first, but bought it back for\r\n£20, at a time when his friend wanted cash; he sold it for the same\r\namount, and it afterwards got into the possession of Joseph Gillot, the\r\npen maker, at the sale of whose collection \"Lancaster Castle\" was\r\nknocked down for £3,601 10s. The highest price Cox ever received for a\r\npicture, and that on one single occasion only, was £100; in another case\r\nhe had £95; his average prices for large pictures were rather under than\r\nover £50 a piece in his best days. \"The Sea Shore at Rhyl,\" for which he\r\nreceived £100, has been since sold for £2,300; \"The Vale of Clwyd,\" for\r\nwhich he accepted £95, brought £2,500. Two pictures for which he\r\nreceived £40 each in 1847, were sold in 1872 for £1,575 and £1,550\r\nrespectively. Two others at £40 each have sold since for £2,300 and\r\n£2,315 5s. respectively. His church at \"Bettws-y-Coed\" one of the finest\r\nof his paintings, fetched £2,500 at a sale in London, in March, 1884. In\r\nthe hall of the Royal Oak Inn, Bettws-y-Coed (David's favourite place),\r\nthere is fixed a famous signboard which Cox painted for the house in\r\n1847, and which gave rise to considerable litigation as to its ownership\r\nbeing vested in the tenant or the owner, the decision being in the\r\nlatter's favour.\r\n\r\n_Cox_, William Sands, F.R.S. and F.R.C.S., the son of a local surgeon,\r\nwas born in 1801. After \"walking the hospitals\" in London and Paris, he\r\nsettled here in 1825, being appointed surgeon to the Dispensary, and in\r\n1828, with the co-operation of the late Doctors Johnstone and Booth, and\r\nother influential friends, succeeded in organising the Birmingham Royal\r\nSchool of Medicine and Surgery, which proved eminently successful until,\r\nby the munificent aid of the Rev. Dr. Warneford, it was converted into\r\nQueen's College by a charter of incorporation, which was granted in\r\n1843. The Queen's Hospital was also founded mainly through the exertions\r\nof Mr. Sands Cox, for the education of the medical students of the\r\nCollege. In 1863 Mr. Cox retired from practice, and went to reside near\r\nTamworth, afterwards removing to Leamington and Kenilworth, at which\r\nlatter place he died, December 23rd, 1875. He was buried in the family\r\nvault at Aston, the coffin being carried to the grave by six old\r\nstudents at the College, funeral scarfs, hatbands, and \"other such\r\npieces of mummery\" being dispensed with, according to the deceased's\r\nwish. He left many charitable legacies, among them being £15,000, to be\r\ndealt with in the following manner:--£3,000 to be applied in building\r\nand endowing a church then in course of erection at Balsall Heath, and\r\nto be known as St. Thomas-in-the-Moors, and the remaining £12,000 to be\r\ndevoted to the erection and endowment of three dispensaries--one at\r\nBalsall Heath, one at Aston, and the other at Hockley. Two sums of\r\n£3,000 were left to found dispensaries at Tamworth and Kenilworth, and a\r\ncottage hospital at Moreton-in-the-Marsh; his medical library and a\r\nnumber of other articles being also left for the last-named institution.\r\n\r\n_Davies_, Dr. Birt.--By birth a Hampshire man, by descent a Welshman,\r\ncoming to Birmingham in 1823, Dr. Davies soon became a man of local\r\nnote. As a politician in the pre-Reform days, as a physician of\r\neminence, and as Borough Coroner for three dozen years, he occupied a\r\nprominent position, well justified by his capacity and force of\r\ncharacter. He took an active part in the founding of the Birmingham\r\nSchool of Medicine, the forerunner of the Queen's College, and was\r\nelected one of the three first physicians to the Queen's Hospital, being\r\nits senior physician for sixteen years. When the Charter of\r\nIncorporation was granted, Dr. Davies was chosen by the Town Council as\r\nthe first Coroner, which office he held until June 8th, 1875, when he\r\nresigned, having, as he wrote to the Council, on the 29th of May\r\nterminated his 36th year of office, and 76th year of his age. Though an\r\nardent politician, it is from his Coronership that he will be remembered\r\nmost, having held about 30,000 inquests in his long term of office,\r\nduring the whole of which time, it has been said, he never took a\r\nholiday, appointed a deputy, or slept out of the borough. His official\r\ndignity sat heavily upon him, his temper of late years often led him\r\ninto conflict with jurors and medical witnesses, but he was well\r\nrespected by all who knew the quiet unpretending benevolence of his\r\ncharacter, never better exhibited than at the time of the cholera panic\r\nin 1832. The doctor had established a Fever Hospital in Bath Row, and\r\nhere he received and treated, by himself, the only cases of Asiatic\r\ncholera imported into the town. He died December 11th, 1878.\r\n\r\n_De Lys_, Dr.--One of the physicians to the General Hospital, and the\r\nproposer of the Deaf and Dumb Institution. A native of Brittany, and one\r\nof several French refugees who settled here when driven from their own\r\ncountry, at the time of the Revolution, Dr. De Lys remained with us till\r\nhis death, August 24th, 1831, being then in his 48th year.\r\n\r\n_Digby_, John, made Lord Digby in 1618, and Earl of Bristol in 1622, was\r\nborn at Coleshill in 1580. He was sent Ambassador to Spain by James I.\r\nto negotiate a marriage between Prince Charles and the Infanta. He went\r\nabroad when the Civil War broke out, and died at Paris in 1653.\r\n\r\n_Edmonds_.--George Edmonds, was a son of the Baptist minister of Bond\r\nStreet Chapel, and was born in 1788. For many years after he grew up\r\nGeorge kept a school, but afterwards devoted himself to the Law, and was\r\nappointed Clerk of the Peace on the incorporation of the borough. For\r\ntaking part in what Government chose to consider an illegal meeting Mr.\r\nEdmonds had to suffer 12 months' imprisonment, but it only increased his\r\npopularity and made him recognised as leader of the Radical party.\r\nDuring the great Reform movements he was always to the fore, and there\r\ncan be little doubt that it was to his untiring energy that the\r\nPolitical Union owed much of its success. In his later years he printed\r\n(partly with his own hands) one of the strangest works ever issued from\r\nthe press, being nothing less than an alphabet, grammar, and dictionary\r\nof a new and universal language. On this he must have spent an immense\r\namount of philosophical and philological research during the busiest\r\nyears of his active life, but like other schemes of a similar character\r\nit came into the world some scores of generations too soon. His death\r\ntook place (hastened by his own hand) July 1, 1868.\r\n\r\n_Everitt_, Allen Edward.--Artist, antiquarian, and archæologist. It is\r\nreported that his portfolio contained more than a thousand sketches of\r\nhis own taking, of old churches, mansions, cottages, or barns in the\r\nMidland Counties. Born here in 1824 Mr. Everitt had reached his 55th\r\nyear before taking to himself a wife, whom he left a widow June 11,\r\n1882, through catching a cold while on a sketching tour. He was much\r\nloved in all artistic circles, having been (for twenty-four years) hon.\r\nsec. to the Society of Artists, a most zealous coadjutor of the Free\r\nLibraries Committee, and honorary curator of tha Art Gallery; in private\r\nor public life he spoke ill of no man, nor could any speak of him with\r\naught but affection and respect.\r\n\r\n_Fletcher_, George.--Author of the \"Provincialist\" and other poems, a\r\njourneyman printer, and much respected for his genial character and\r\nhonest kind-heartedness. Died Feb. 20, 1874, aged 64.\r\n\r\n_Fothergill_, John.--Taken into partnership by Matthew Boulton in 1762,\r\ndevoting himself principally to the foreign agencies. Many of the\r\nbranches of trade in which he was connected proved failures, and he died\r\ninsolvent in 1782, while Boulton breasted the storm, and secured fortune\r\nby means of his steam engines. He did not, however, forget his first\r\npartner's widow and children.\r\n\r\n_Fox_, Charles Fox, of the firm of Fox, Henderson and Co., was born at\r\nDerby, March 11, 1810. His first connection with this town arose from\r\nhis being engaged with Stephenson on the construction of the Birmingham\r\nand Liverpool line. He was knighted in 1851, in recognition of his\r\nwonderful skill as shown in the erection of the International Exhibition\r\nof that year, and we have a local monument to his fame in the roof which\r\nspans the New Street Station. He died in 1874, and was buried at Nunhead\r\nCemetery, London. The firm of Fox, Henderson and Co., was originally\r\nBramah and Fox, Mr. Henderson not coming in till the death of Mr.\r\nBramah, a well-known ironmaster of this neighbourhood, and whose name is\r\nworld-famous for his celebrated locks.\r\n\r\n_Geach_.--Charles Geach was a Cornishman, born in 1808, and came to\r\nBirmingham in 1826 as one of the clerks in the Branch Bank of England,\r\nthen opened. In 1836 he was instrumental in the formation of two of our\r\nlocal banks, and became the manager of one of them, the Birmingham and\r\nMidland. In 1842 he made a fortunate speculation in the purchase of some\r\nextensive ironworks at Rotherham just previous to the days of \"the\r\nrailway mania.\" The profits on iron at that time were something\r\nwonderful; as a proof of which it has been stated that on one occasion\r\nMr. Geach took orders for 30,000 tons at £12, the cost to him not being\r\nmore than half that sum! The Patent Shaft Works may be said to have owed\r\nits origin also to this gentleman. Mr. Geach was chosen mayor for 1847,\r\nand in 1851 was returned to Parliament for Coventry. His death occurred\r\nNov. 1, 1854. A full-length portrait hangs in the board-room of the\r\nbank, of which he retained the managing-directorship for many years.\r\n\r\n_Gem_, Major Thomas Henry.--The well-known Clerk to the Magistrates,\r\nborn May 21, 1819, was the pioneer of the Volunteer movement in this\r\ntown, as well as the originator of the fashionable game of lawn tennis.\r\nA splendid horseman, and an adept at all manly games, he also ranked\r\nhigh as a dramatic author, and no amateur theatricals could be got\r\nthrough without his aid and presence. His death, November 4, 1881,\r\nresulted from an accident which occurred on June 25 previous, at the\r\ncamp in Sutton Park.\r\n\r\n_Gillott_.--Joseph Gillott was born at Sheffield in 1799, but through\r\nwant of work found his way here in 1822, spending his last penny in\r\nrefreshments at the old publichouse then standing at corner of Park\r\nStreet, where the Museum Concert Hall exists. His first employment was\r\nbuckle making, and being steady he soon took a garret in Bread Street\r\nand became his own master in the manufacture of buckles and other \"steel\r\ntoys.\" The merchant who used to buy of him said \"Gillott made very\r\nexcellent goods, and came for his money every week.\" It was that making\r\nof excellent goods and his untiring perseverance that secured him\r\nsuccess. His sweetheart was sister to William and John Mitchell, and it\r\nis questionable whether Gillott's first efforts at making steel pens did\r\nnot spring from the knowledge he gained from her as to what the\r\nMitchells were doing in that line. The Sheffield blade, however, was the\r\nfirst to bring the \"press\" into the proeess of making the pens, and that\r\nsecret he must have kept pretty closely from all but his lass, as Mr. J.\r\nGillott often told, in after life, how, on the morning of his marriage,\r\nhe began and finished a gross of pens, and sold them for £7 4s. before\r\nthey went to church. The accumulation of his fortune began from that\r\nday, the name of Gillott in a very few years being known the wide world\r\nover. The penmaker was a great patron of the artists, gathering a famous\r\ncollection which at his death realised £170,000. His first interview\r\nwith Turner was described in an American journal a few years back.\r\nGillott having rudely pushed his way into the studio and turning the\r\npictures about without the artist deigning to notice the intruder, tried\r\nto attract attention by asking the prices of three paintings. Turner\r\ncarelessly answered \"4,000 guineas,\" \"£3,000,\" and \"1,500 guineas.\"\r\n\"I'll take the three,\" said Gillott. Then Turner rose, with \"Who the\r\ndevil are you to intrude here against my orders? You must be a queer\r\nsort of a beggar, I fancy.\" \"You're another queer beggar\" was the reply.\r\n\"I am Gillott, the penmaker. My banker tells me you are clever, and I\r\nhave come to buy some pictures.\" \"By George!\" quoth Turner, \"you are a\r\ndroll fellow, I must say.\" \"You're another,\" said Gillott. \"But do you\r\nreally want to purchase those pictures,\" asked Turner. \"Yes, in course I\r\ndo, or I would not have climbed those blessed stairs this morning,\" was\r\nthe answer. Turner marvelled at the man, and explained that he had fixed\r\nthe prices named under the idea that he had only got an impertinent\r\nintruder to deal with, that two of the pictures were already sold, but\r\nthat his visitor could have the first for £1,000. \"I'll take it,\" said\r\nthe prince of penmakers, \"and you must make me three or four more at\r\nyour own price.\" If other artists did as well with Mr. Gillott they\r\ncould have had but little cause of complaint. Another hobby of Mr.\r\nGillott's was collecting fiddles, his specimens, of which he once said\r\nhe had a \"boat load,\" realising £4,000; while his cabinet of precious\r\nstones was of immense value. The millionaire died Jan. 5, 1872, leaving\r\n£3,000 to local charities.\r\n\r\n_Guest_, James.--Originally a brass-founder, but imbued with the\r\nprinciples of Robert Owen, he became an active member of the Political\r\nUnion and other \"freedom-seeking\" societies, and opened in Steelhouse\r\nLane a shop for the sale of that kind of literature suited to ardent\r\nworkers in the Radical cause. Mr. Guest believed that \"all bad laws must\r\nbe broken before they could be mended,\" and for years he followed out\r\nthat idea so far as the taxes on knowledge were concerned. He was the\r\nfirst to sell unstamped papers here and in the Black Country, and,\r\nnotwithstanding heavy fines, and even imprisonment, he kept to his\r\nprinciples as long as the law stood as it was. In 1830 he published\r\nHutton \"History of Birmingham\" in cheap numbers, unfortunately mixing\r\nwith it many chapters about the Political Union, the right of a Free\r\nPress, &c., in a confusing manner. The book, however, was very popular,\r\nand has been reprinted from the original stereoplates several times. Mr.\r\nGuest died Jan. 17, 1881, in his 78th year.\r\n\r\n_Hill_, Rowland.--The originator of the present postal system, born at\r\nKidderminster, December 3, 1795, coming to Birmingham with his parents\r\nwhen about seven years old. His father opened a school at the corner of\r\nGough Street and Blucher Street, which was afterwards (in 1819) removed\r\nto the Hagley Road, where, as \"Hazlewood School\" it became more than\r\nlocally famous. In 1825 it was again removed, and further off, this time\r\nbeing taken to Bruce Castle, Tottenham, where the family yet resides.\r\nRowland and his brother, Matthew Davenport Hill, afterwards Recorder of\r\nBirmingham, who took part in the management of the school, went with it,\r\nand personally Rowland Hill's connection with our town may be said to\r\nhave ceased. Early in 1837 Mr. Hill published his proposed plans of Post\r\nOffice reform, but which for a long time met with no favour from either\r\nof the great political parties, or in official quarters, where, it has\r\nbeen said, he was snubbed as a would-be interloper, and cursed as \"a\r\nfellow from Birmingham coming to teach people their business\"--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"All office doors were closed against him--hard\r\n  All office heads were closed against him too,\r\n  'He had but worked, like others, for reward,'\r\n  'The thing was all a dream.' 'It would not do.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1839, more than 2,000 petitions were presented to Parliament in\r\nfavour of Mr. Hill's plans, and eventually they were adopted and became\r\nlaw by the 3rd and 4th Vict., cap. 96. The new postage law by which the\r\nuniform rate of fourpence per letter was tried as an experiment, came\r\ninto operation on the 5th of December, 1839, and on the 10th January,\r\n1840, the reduced uniform rate of 1d. per letter of half-an-ounce weight\r\nwas commenced. Under the new system the privilege of franking letters\r\nenjoyed by members of Parliament was abolished, facilities of prepayment\r\nwere afforded by the introduction of postage stamps, double postage was\r\nlevied on letters not prepaid, and arrangements were made for the\r\nregistration of letters. Mr. Hill received an appointment in the\r\nTreasury, but in 1841, he was told his services were no longer required.\r\nThis flagrant injustice caused great indignation, and a national\r\ntestimonial of £15,000 was presented to him June 17, 1846. On a change\r\nof Government Mr. Hill was appointed Secretary to the Postmaster\r\nGeneral, and, in 1854, Secretary to the Post Office, a position which he\r\nretained until failing health caused him to resign in March, 1864, the\r\nTreasury awarding him for life his salary of £2,000 per year. In the\r\nsame year he received a Parliamentary grant of £20,000, and in 1860, he\r\nwas made a K.C.B., other honours from Oxford, &c., following. Sir\r\nRowland was presented with the freedom of the City by the London Court\r\nof Common Council, June 6, 1879, the document being contained in a\r\nsuitable gold casket. It was incidentally mentioned in the course of the\r\nproceedings, that at the time Sir Rowland Hill's system was inaugurated\r\nthe annual amount of correspondence was 79 millions, or three letters\r\nper head of the population; while then it exceeded 1,000 millions of\r\nletters, 100 millions of post-cards, and 320 millions of newspapers, and\r\nthe gross receipt in respect of it was £6,000,000 sterling. Sir Rowland\r\nHill died Aug. 27, 1879, leaving but one son, \"Pearson Hill,\" late of\r\nthe Post Office.\r\n\r\n_Hollins_, George--The first appointed organist of the Town Hall (in\r\n1834), having been previously organist at St. Paul's, in the graveyard\r\nof which church he was buried in 1841, the funeral being attended by\r\nhundreds of friends, musicians, and singers of the town and\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n_Holt_, Thomas Littleton.--A Press man, whose death (Sept. 14, 1879) at\r\nthe age of 85, severed one of the very few remaining links connecting\r\nthe journalism of the past with the present. It was to him that the late\r\nMr. Dickens owed his introduction to Dr. Black, then the editor of the\r\n_Morning Chronicle_. Mr. Holt was proprietor of the _Iron Times_, which\r\nstarted during the railway mania. When his friend Leigh Hunt was\r\nimprisoned for libelling the Prince Regent, he was the first to visit\r\nhim. He took an active part in popularising cheap literature, and it was\r\ngreatly owing to him that the advertisement duty was repealed. He also\r\ntook an active part in the abolition of the paper duty. Besides starting\r\nmany papers in London in the latter period of his life, he returned to\r\nhis native town, Birmingham, where he started _Ryland's Iron Trade\r\nCircular_, to the success of which his writings largely contributed.\r\n\r\n_Humphreys_, Henry Noel.--This eminent naturalist and archæologist's\r\ncareer closed in June, 1879. A son of the late Mr. James Humphreys, he\r\nwas born in Birmingham in 1809, and was educated at the Grammar School\r\nhere. He was the author of many interesting works connected with his\r\nzoological and antiquarian researches. Among the most important of the\r\nlatter class may be specified:--\"Illustrations of Froissart's\r\nChronicles,\" \"The Parables of our Lord Illustrated,\" \"The Coins of\r\nEngland,\" \"Ancient Coins and Medals,\" \"The Illuminated Books of the\r\nMediæval Period,\" the \"Coin Collector's Manual,\" the \"Coinage of the\r\nBritish Empire,\" \"Stories by an Archæologist,\" and especially his _magna\r\nopera_, so to speak, \"The Art of Illumination,\" and \"The History of the\r\nArt of Writing from the Hieroglyphic Period down to the introduction of\r\nAlphabets.\"\r\n\r\n_James_, William.--A Warwickshire engineer, born at Henley-in-Arden,\r\nJune, 13, 1771. Mr. James has been called the first projector of\r\nrailways, as there was none started previous to his laying out a line\r\nfrom here to Wolverhampton, which was given up in favour of the Canal\r\nCompanies. The wharves in Newhall Street were constructed on the site of\r\nhis proposed railway station. He afterwards projected and surveyed many\r\nother lines including Birmingham to Manchester through Derbyshire, the\r\nBirmingham and London, etc. West Bromwich owes no little of its\r\nprosperity to this gentleman, who opened many collieries in its\r\nneighbourhood. At one time Mr. James was said to have been worth\r\n£150,000, besides £10,000 a year coming in from his profession, but he\r\nlost nearly all before his death.\r\n\r\n_Jeffery_.--George Edward Jeffery, who died Dec. 29th, 1877, aged 33,\r\nwas a local writer who promised to make a name had he lived longer.\r\n\r\n_Johnstone_, Dr. John, a distinguished local physician, was born at\r\nWorcester in 1768. Though he acquired a high reputation for his\r\ntreatment of diseases, it was noticeable that he made a very sparing use\r\nof medicines. Died in 1836.\r\n\r\n_Johnstone_, John, whose death was the result of being knocked down by a\r\ncab in Broad Street in Oct. 1875, was one of those all-round inventive\r\ncharacters who have done so much for the trades of this town. He was\r\nborn in Dumfriesshire in 1801, and was apprenticed to a builder, coming\r\nto this town in 1823. He was soon noticed as the first architectural\r\ndraughtsman of his day, but his genius was not confined to any one line.\r\nHe was the first to introduce photographic vignettes, he invented the\r\npeculiar lamp used in railway carriages, he improved several\r\nagricultural implements, he could lay out plans for public buildings or\r\na machine for making hooks and eyes, and many well-to-do families owe\r\ntheir rise in the world to acting on the ideas put before them by Mr.\r\nJohnstone. In the latter portion of his life he was engaged at the\r\nCambridge Street Works as consulter in general.\r\n\r\n_Kempson_, James--In one of those gossiping accounts of the \"Old\r\nTaverns\" of Birmingham which \"S.D.R.\" has written, mention is made of a\r\nlittle old man, dear to the musicians under the name of \"Daddy Kempson,\"\r\nwho appears to have been the originator of our Triennial Musical\r\nFestivals in 1768, and who conducted a performance at St. Paul's as late\r\nas the year 1821, he being then 80 years of age.\r\n\r\n_Küchler_, C.H.--A medalist, for many years in the employ of Boulton,\r\nfor whom he sunk the dies for part of the copper coinage of 1797, &c.\r\nThe 2d. piece is by him. He was buried in Handsworth Churchyard.\r\n\r\n_Lightfoot_.--Lieut.-General Thomas Lightfoot, C.B., Colonel of the 62nd\r\nRegiment, who died at his residence, Barbourne House, Worcester, Nov.\r\n15, 1858, in his 84th year, and who entered the British army very early\r\nin life, was the last surviving officer of the famous 45th, the\r\n\"Fire-eaters\" as they were called, that went to the Peninsula with Moore\r\nand left it with Wellington. Lightfoot was in Holland in 1799. He was\r\npresent in almost every engagement of the Peninsular War. He received\r\nseven wounds; a ball which caused one of these remained in his body till\r\nhis death. He obtained three gold and eleven silver medals, being one\r\nmore than even those of his illustrious commander, the Duke of\r\nWellington. One silver medal was given him by the Duke himself, who said\r\non the occasion he was glad to so decorate one of the brave 45th.\r\nLightfoot was made a C.B. in 1815. Before he became Major-General he was\r\nAide-de-Camp to William IV. and Queen Victoria, and as such rode\r\nimmediately before her Majesty in her coronation procession.\r\nLieutenant-General Lightfoot was a native of this town, and was buried\r\nin the family vault in St. Bartholomew's Church, his remains being\r\nescorted to the tomb by the 4th (Queen's Own) Light Dragoons, commanded\r\nby Colonel Low.\r\n\r\n_Lloyd_.--The founder of the well-known banking firm of Lloyds appears\r\nto have been Charles Lloyd, for some time a minister of the Society of\r\nFriends, who died in 1698.\r\n\r\n_Machin_, William.--Born here in 1798, began his musical career (while\r\napprenticed to papier-mâché making), as a member at the choir at Cannon\r\nStreet Chapel. As a favourite bass singer he was engaged at many of the\r\nfestivals from 1834 to that of 1849. His death occurred in September,\r\n1870.\r\n\r\n_Malins_, David.--Brassfounder, who in course of his life filled several\r\nof the chief offices of our local governing bodies. Born June 5, 1803;\r\ndied December, 1881. Antiquarian and persevering collector of all works\r\nthrowing light upon or having connection with Birmingham or Warwickshire\r\nhistory. Mr. Malins, after the burning of the Free Library, generously\r\ngave the whole of his collection to the formation of the New Reference\r\nLibrary, many of the books being most rare and valuable, and of some of\r\nwhich no other copies are known to exist.\r\n\r\n_Mellon_, Alfred.--Though actually born in London, Mr. Mellon's parents\r\n(his father was a Frenchman) were residents in Birmingham, and we must\r\nclaim this popular conductor as a local musician of note. He was only\r\ntwelve when he joined the Theatre Royal band, but at sixteen he was the\r\nleader and remained so for eight years, removing to London in 1844. In\r\n1856 Mr. Mellon conducted the opening performances at the Music Hall in\r\nBroad Street (now Prince of Wales's Theatre): and will be long\r\nremembered for the \"Promenade Concerts\" he gave at Covent Garden and in\r\nthe provinces. He died from the breaking of a blood-vessel, March 27,\r\n1867.\r\n\r\n_Mogridge_, George, born at Ashted Feb. 17th, 1787, and brought up as a\r\njapanner, was the original \"Old Humphrey\" of our childhood's days, the\r\nauthor of \"Grandfather Grey,\" \"Old Humphrey's Walks in London,\" \"Old\r\nHumphrey's Country Strolls,\" and other juvenile works, of which many\r\nmillions of copies have been sold in England, America, and the Colonies.\r\n\"Peter Parley's Tales\" have been also ascribed to our townsman, who died\r\nNov. 2, 1854.\r\n\r\n_Munden_, T.--In the year 1818, Mr. Munden (born in London in 1798) came\r\nto this town as organist of Christ Church, and was also chosen as\r\nteacher of the Oratorio Choral Society, and to this day it may be said\r\nthat the reputation of our Festival Choir is mostly based on the\r\ninstruction given by him during his long residence among us. From 1823\r\ntill 1849 Mr. Munden acted as Assistant-conductor at the Festivals,\r\nretiring from public life in 1853.\r\n\r\n_Muntz_.--The Revolution in 1792 drove the Muntz family to emigrate from\r\ntheir aristocratic abode in France, and a younger son came to this town,\r\nwhere he married a Miss Purden, and established himself in business.\r\nFrom this alliance sprung _our_ race of the Muntzes. George Frederic,\r\nthe eldest, was born in November, 1794, and losing his father in early\r\nlife, was head of the family in his 18th year. He devoted himself for\r\nmany years, and with great success, to mercantile affairs, but his most\r\nfortunate undertaking, and which has made his name known all over the\r\nworld, was the manufacture of sheathing metal for ships bottoms. It has\r\nbeen doubted whether he did any more than revive another man's lapsed\r\npatent, but it has never been questioned that he made a vast sum of\r\nmoney out of the \"yellow metal.\" In politics, G.F.M. took a very active\r\npart, even before the formation of the Political Union in 1830, and for\r\nmany years he was the idol of his fellow-townsmen. He was elected M.P.\r\nfor Birmingham, in January, 1840, and held the seat till the day of his\r\ndeath, which took place July 30, 1857. His name will be found on many a\r\npage of our local history, even though a statue of him is not yet posed\r\non a pedestal.\r\n\r\n_Murdoch_, William.--Born at Bellow Mill, near Old Cumnock, Ayrshire, in\r\n1750, and brought up as a millwright, came here in search of work in\r\n1777. He was employed by Boulton at 15s. per week for the first two\r\nyears, but he soon became the most trusted of all the many engaged at\r\nSoho, and never left there though offered £1,000 a year to do so. The\r\nfirst steam engine applied to drawing carriages was constructed by him\r\nin the shape of a model which ran round a room in his house at Redruth\r\nin 1784, and which is still in existence. As an inventor, he was second\r\nonly to Watt, his introduction of gas lighting being almost equal to\r\nthat of the steam engine. He lived to be 85, dying November 15, 1839, at\r\nhis residence, Sycamore Hill, Handsworth. His remains lie near those of\r\nhis loved employers, Boulton and Watt, in the parish church.\r\n\r\n_Pettitt_.--Mr. Joseph Pettitt, who died Sept. 9, 1882, in his 70th\r\nyear, was a local artist of note, a member of the Society of Artists,\r\nand for many years a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, our local,\r\nand other exhibitions. In his younger years Mr. Pettitt was employed in\r\nthe papier-mâché trade, a business peculiarly suited to persons gifted\r\nwith artistic faculties. His earliest specimens of landscape attracted\r\nattention, and Mr. Joseph Gillott commissioned the painter to furnish a\r\nnumber of Swiss views for the collection of pictures he had began to\r\ngather. Mr. Pettitt pleased the penmaker, and soon made a name for\r\nhimself, his works being characterised by fine colour and broad vigorous\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\n_Phillips_, Alderman, died Feb. 25, 1876. A member of the first Town\r\nCouncil, and Mayor in 1844. Mr. Phillips long took active part in\r\nmunicipal matters, and was the founder of the Licensed Victuallers'\r\nAsylum.\r\n\r\n_Pickard_, James.--A Birmingham button maker, who patented, Aug. 23,\r\n1780, the use of the crank in the steam engine to procure rotary motion.\r\nHe is supposed to have got the idea from overhearing the conversation of\r\nsome Soho workmen while at their cups. The first engine in which it was\r\nused (and the fly-wheel) was for a manufacturer in Snow Hill, and was\r\nput up by Matthew Washborough, of Bristol.\r\n\r\n_Plant_.--Mr. T.L. Plant, who died very suddenly in a railway carriage\r\nin which he was coming into town on the morning of August 31, 1883, came\r\nto Birmingham in 1840. As a meteorologist, who for more than forty years\r\nhad kept close record of wind and weather, he was well known; his\r\nletters to the newspapers on this and kindred subjects were always\r\ninteresting, and the part he took in advanced sanitary questions gained\r\nhim the friendship of all. Mr. Plant was a native of Yorkshire, and was\r\nin his 64th year at the time of his death.\r\n\r\n_Playfair_, William (brother of the eminent Scotch mathematician) was\r\nengaged as a draughtsman at the Soho Works, after serving apprenticeship\r\nas a millwright. He patented various inventions, and was well known as a\r\npolitical writer, &c. Born, 1759; died, 1823.\r\n\r\n_Postgate_, John.--This name should be honoured in every household for a\r\nlife's exertion in the obtainment of purity in what we eat and drink.\r\nBeginning life as a grocer's boy, he saw the most gross adulteration\r\ncarried on in all the varieties of articles sold by his employers, and\r\nafterwards being with a medical firm, he studied chemistry, and devoted\r\nhis life to analysing food and drugs. Coming to this town in 1854, he\r\nobtained the assistance of Mr. Wm. Scholefield, by whose means the first\r\nParliamentary Committee of Enquiry was appointed; the revelations were\r\nastounding, but it was not till 1875 that anything like a stringent Act\r\nwas passed whereby the adulterators could be properly punished. The\r\nauthor of this great national benefit was allowed to die almost in\r\npoverty, uncared for by his countrymen at large, or by his adopted\r\ntownsmen of Birmingham. Born October 21, 1820, Mr. Postgate died in\r\nJuly, 1881.\r\n\r\n_Ragg_, Rev. Thomas.--Once a bookseller and printer, editor and\r\npublisher of the _Birmingham Advertiser_, and author of several works,\r\none of which secured for him the goodwill of the Bishop of Rochester,\r\nwho ordained him a minister of the Established Church in 1858. He died\r\nDecember 3rd, 1881, in his 74th year, at Lawley, Salop, having been\r\nperpetual curate thereof from 1865. His parishioners and friends\r\nsubscribed for a memorial window, and a fund of a little over £200 was\r\nraised for the benefit of the widow, but a very small part thereof went\r\nfrom Birmingham.\r\n\r\n_Ratcliffe_.--Mr. John Ratcliffe, who had in past years been a Town\r\nCommissioner, a Low Bailiff, a Town Councillor, and Alderman, was chosen\r\nas Mayor in 1856, and, being popular as well as wealthy, got reappointed\r\nyearly until 1859. In the first-named year, H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge\r\nwas the Mayor's guest when he came to open Calthorpe Park. When the\r\nPrincess Royal was married, in 1858, the Mayor celebrated the auspicious\r\nevent by giving a dinner to more than a thousand poor people, and he\r\nheaded the deputation which was sent from here to present England's\r\nroyal daughter with some articles of Birmingham manufacture. On the\r\noccasion of the Queen's visit to open Aston Park, Mr. Mayor received the\r\nhonour of Knighthood, and became Sir John, dying in 1864, in his 67th\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n_Rennie_, John.--The celebrated engineer and architect, who built\r\nWaterloo and Southwark Bridges, Plymouth Breakwater, &c., was for a\r\nshort time in the employ of Boulton and Watt.\r\n\r\n_Roebuck_, Dr. John, grandfather of the late John Arthur Roebuck, M.D.\r\nwas born at Sheffield in 1718; came to Birmingham in 1745. He introduced\r\nbetter methods of refining gold and silver, originated more economical\r\nstyles of manufacturing the chemicals used in trade (especially oil of\r\nvitriol), and revived the use of pit coal in smelting iron. After\r\nleaving this town he started the Carron Ironworks on the Clyde, and in\r\n1768 joined James Watt in bringing out the latter's steam engine. Some\r\nmining investments failed before the engine was perfected, and his\r\ninterest thereon was transferred to Mr. Boulton, the doctor dying in\r\n1794 a poor man.\r\n\r\n_Rogers_.--John Rogers, one of \"the glorious army of martyrs,\" was burnt\r\nat Smithfield (London) on February 4, 1555. He was born in Deritend\r\nabout the year 1500, and assisted in the translation and printing of the\r\nBible into English. He was one of the Prebendaries of St. Paul's,\r\nLondon, but after Queen Mary came to the throne he gave offence by\r\npreaching against idolatry and superstition, and was kept imprisoned for\r\neighteen months prior to condemnation and execution, being the first\r\nmartyr of the Reformation. He left a wife and eleven children. See\r\n\"_Statues and Memorials_.\"\r\n\r\n_Russell_.--William Congreve Russell, Esq., J.P., and in 1832 elected\r\nM.P. for East Worcestershire, who died Nov. 30, 1850, aged 72, was the\r\nlast of a family whose seat was at Moor Green for many generations.\r\n\r\n_Ryall_, Dr. John.--The first headmaster of the Edgbaston Proprietary\r\nSchool, which opened under his superintendence in January, 1838, his\r\nconnection therewith continuing till Christmas, 1846. He was a man of\r\ngreat learning, with a remarkable command of language, and a singularly\r\naccurate writer. Born March 11, 1806, his intellectual acquirements\r\nexpanded so rapidly that at sixteen he was able to support himself, and,\r\npassing with the highest honours, he had taken his degree and accepted\r\nthe head mastership of Truro Grammar School before his 21st birthday.\r\nFor the last 30 years of his life he filled the post of Vice-President\r\nof Queen's College, Cork, departing to a better sphere June 21, 1875.\r\n\r\n_Ryland_, Arthur.--Descendant of a locally long-honoured family this\r\ngentleman, a lawyer, added considerably to the prestige of the name by\r\nthe prominent position he took in every work leading to the advancement\r\nof his townsmen, social, moral, and political. Connected with almost\r\nevery institution in the borough, many of which he aided to establish or\r\ndevelop. Mr. Ryland's name is placed foremost among the founders of the\r\nBirmingham and Midland Institute, the Art Gallery, the public Libraries,\r\nthe Hospitals for Women and Children, the Sanatorium, &c., while he was\r\none of the greatest friends to the Volunteer movement and the adoption\r\nof the School Board's system of education. During life he was appointed\r\nto all the leading offices of citizenship, in addition to being chosen\r\nPresident of the Law Society and other bodies. He died at Cannes, March\r\n23, 1877, in his 70th year.\r\n\r\n_Scholefield_, William.--Son of Joshua Scholefield, was chosen as the\r\nfirst Mayor after the incorporation, having previously been the High\r\nBailiff of the Court Leet. In 1847 he was elected M.P., holding that\r\noffice through five Parliaments and until his death July 9, 1867 (in his\r\n58th year). In the House, as well as in his private life and business\r\ncircles, he was much esteemed for the honest fixity of purpose which\r\ncharacterised all his life.\r\n\r\n_Shaw_, Charles, commonly known as \"Charley\" Shaw, was a large\r\nmanufacturing merchant, and held high position as a moneyed man for many\r\nyears down to his death. He was as hard as a nail, rough as a bear, and\r\nmany funny tales have been told about him, but he is worth a place in\r\nlocal history, if only for the fact that it was principally through his\r\nexertions that the great monetary panic of 1837 was prevented from\r\nbecoming almost a national collapse.\r\n\r\n_Sherlock_.--Though not to be counted exactly as one of our Birmingham\r\nmen, Thomas Sherlock, Bishop of London, who purchased the manor estates\r\nin or about 1730, must have a place among the \"noteworthies.\" Hutton\r\nstates that when the Bishop made his bargain the estate brought in about\r\n£400 per annum, but that in another thirty years or so it had increased\r\nto twice the value. The historian goes on to say that \"the pious old\r\nBishop was frequently solicited to grant building leases, but answered,\r\n'his land was valuable, and if built upon, his successor, at the\r\nexpiration of the term, would have the rubbish to carry off:' he\r\ntherefore not only refused, but prohibited his successor from granting\r\nsuch leases. But Sir Thomas Gooch, who succeeded him, seeing the great\r\nimprovement of the neighbouring estates, and wisely judging fifty pounds\r\nper acre preferable to five, procured an Act in about 1766, to set aside\r\nthe prohibiting clause in the Bishop's will. Since which, a considerable\r\ntown may be said to have been erected upon his property, now (1787)\r\nabout £2,400 per annum.\" Bishop and historian alike, would be a little\r\nastonished at the present value of the property, could they see it.\r\n\r\n_Small_, Dr. William.--A friend of Boulton, Watt, and Priestley, and one\r\nof the famous Lunar Society, born in county Angus, Scotland, in 1734,\r\ndying here in 1778. A physician of most extensive knowledge, during a\r\nresidence in America he filled the chair of Professor of Natural\r\nPhilosophy at the University of Williamsburg, Virginia. In the beautiful\r\npleasure grounds of Soho House, when Matthew Boulton lived, there was an\r\nurn inscribed to the memory of Dr. Small, on which appeared some\r\nimpressive lines written by Dr. Darwin, of Derby:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Here, while no titled dust, no sainted bone,\r\n    No lover weeping over beauty's bier,\r\n  No warrior frowning in historic stone,\r\n    Extorts your praises, or requests your tear;\r\n  Cold Contemplation leans her aching head,\r\n    On human woe her steady eye she turns,\r\n  Waves her meek hand, and sighs for Science dead,\r\n    For Science, Virtue, and for SMALL she mourns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Smith_.--Mr. Brooke Smith (of the well-known firm of Martineau and\r\nSmith), a valued supporter of Penn Street and Dale Street Industrial\r\nSchools, the Graham Street Charity, and other institutions connected\r\nwith the welfare of the young, died in April, 1876, in his 78th year. A\r\nLiberal in every way, the sound common sense of Mr. Brooke Smith, who\r\nwas noted for an unvarying courtesy to all parties and creeds, kept him\r\nfrom taking any active share in local politics where urbanity and\r\nkindliness is heavily discounted.\r\n\r\n_Sturge_, Joseph.--Born August 2, 1793, at Alberton, a village on the\r\nSevern, was intended for a farmer, but commenced trading as a cornfactor\r\nat Bewdley, in 1814, his brother Charles joining him in 1822, in which\r\nyear they also came to Birmingham. Mr. Sturge was chosen a Town\r\nCommissioner, but resigned in 1830, being opposed to the use of the Town\r\nHall being granted for oratorios. He was one of the directors of the\r\nLondon and Birmingham Railway when it was opened in 1836, but objecting\r\nto the running of Sunday trains, withdrew from the board. In 1838 he was\r\nelected Alderman for St. Thomas's Ward, but would not subscribe to the\r\nrequired declaration respecting the Established religion. At a very\r\nearly date he took an active part in the Anti-slavery movement, and his\r\nvisit to the West Indies and subsequent reports thereon had much to do\r\nwith hastening the abolition of slavery. When the working-classes were\r\nstruggling for electoral freedom and \"the Charter,\" Mr. Sturge was one\r\nof the few found willing to help them, though his peace-loving\r\ndisposition failed to induce them to give up the idea of \"forcing\" their\r\nrights. Having a wish to take part in the making of the laws, he issued\r\nan address to the electors of Birmingham in 1840, but was induced to\r\nretire; in August, 1842, he contested Nottingham, receiving 1,801 votes\r\nagainst his opponent's 1885; in 1844 he put up for Birmingham, but only\r\n364 votes were given him; and he again failed at Leeds in 1847, though\r\nhe polled 1,976 voters. In 1850 he visited Schleswig-Holstein and\r\nDenmark, and in February, 1854, St. Petersburgh, each time in hopes of\r\ndoing something to prevent the wars then commencing, but failure did not\r\nkeep him from Finland in 1856 with relief for the sufferers. In 1851 he\r\ntook a house in Ryland Road and fitted it up as a reformatory, which\r\nafterwards led to the establishment at Stoke Prior. Mr. Sturge died on\r\nMay 14, 1859, and was buried on the 20th in Bull Street. His character\r\nneeds no comment, for he was a Christian in his walk as well as in his\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\n_Taylor_, John.--Died in 1775, aged 64, leaving a fortune of over\r\n£200,000, acquired in the manufacture of metal buttons, japanned ware,\r\nsnuff boxes, &c. It is stated that he sent out £800 worth of buttons\r\nweekly, and that one of his workmen earned 70s. per week by painting\r\nsnuff boxes at 1/4d. each. Mr. Taylor must have had a monopoly in the\r\nlatter, for this one hand at the rate named must have decorated some\r\n170,000 boxes per annum.\r\n\r\n_Tomlins_.--Samuel Boulton Tomlins, the son of a local iron merchant\r\n(who was one of the founders of the Birmingham Exchange) and Mary Harvey\r\nBoulton (a near relative to Matthew) was born September 28, 1797, at\r\nPark House, in Park Street, then a vine-covered residence surrounded by\r\ngardens. His mother was so great a favourite with Baskerville that the\r\ncelebrated printer gave her one of two specially-printed Bibles,\r\nretaining the other for himself. After serving an apprenticeship to a\r\nbookseller, Mr. Tomlins was taken into Lloyd's Bank as a clerk, but was\r\nsoon promoted to be manager of the branch then at Stockport, but which\r\nwas taken over afterwards by a Manchester Banking Company, with whom Mr.\r\nTomlins stayed until 1873, dying September 8, 1879.\r\n\r\n_Ulwin_.--Though nearly last in our list, Ulwin, or Alwyne, the son of\r\nWigod, and the grandson of Woolgeat, the Danish Earl of Warwick, must\r\nrank first among our noteworthy men, if only from the fact that his name\r\nis absolutely the first found in historical records as having anything\r\nto do with Birmingham. This was in King Edward the Confessor's time,\r\nwhen Alwyne was Sheriff _(vice-comes)_ and through his son Turchill, who\r\ncame to be Earl of Warwick, the Ardens and the Bracebridges trace their\r\ndescent from the old Saxon kings, Alwyne's mother being sister to\r\nLeofric, III., Earl of Mercia. Whether Alwyne thrived on his unearned\r\nincrement or not, the politicians of the time have not told us, but the\r\npossessions that came to him by the Dano-Saxon marriage of his parents\r\nseems to have been rather extensive, as it is written that he owned not\r\nonly the manor of Birmingham, but also Halesowen, Escelie, Hagley, and\r\nSwinford in Wirecescire (Worcestershire), Great Barr, Handsworth, Penn,\r\nRushall and Walsall, in Staffordshire, as well as Aston, Witton,\r\nErdington, and Edgbaston. The modern name of Allen is deducible from\r\nAlwyne, and the bearers thereof, if so inclined, may thus be enabled to\r\nalso claim a kingly descent, and much good may it do them.\r\n\r\n_Underwood_, Thomas.--The first printer to introduce the art of\r\nlithography into Birmingham, and he is also credited with being the\r\ndiscoverer of chromo-litho, and the first to publish coloured almanacks\r\nand calendars. He did much to foster the taste for art, but will\r\nprobably be most generally recollected by the number of views of old\r\nBirmingham and reproductions of pictures and maps of local interest that\r\nhe published. Mr. Underwood died March 14, 1882, in his 73rd year.\r\n\r\n_Van Wart_.--Henry Van Wart, was born near New York, Sept. 25, 1783, and\r\ntook up his abode with us in 1808. By birth an American, by descent a\r\nDutchman, he became a Brum through being naturalised by special Act of\r\nParliament, and for nearly seventy years was one of our principal\r\nmerchants. He was also one of the first Aldermen chosen for the borough.\r\nDied Feb. 15, 1873, in his 90th year.\r\n\r\n_Ward_.--Humble Ward, son of Charles I.'s jeweller, who married the\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Dudley, was created Baron Ward of Birmingham.\r\nTheir son Edward thus came to the title of Lord Dudley and Ward in 1697.\r\n\r\n_Warren_.--Thomas Warren was a well-known local bookseller of the last\r\ncentury. He joined Wyatt and Paul in their endeavours to establish the\r\nCotton Spinning Mill, putting £1,000 into the speculation, which\r\nunfortunately landed him in bankruptcy. He afterwards became an\r\nauctioneer, and in 1788 had the pleasure of selling the machinery of the\r\nmill in which forty years previous his money had been lost.\r\n\r\n_Watt_, James, was born at Greenock, Jan. 19, 1736, and (if we are to\r\ncredit the somewhat apocryphal anecdote of his testing the power of\r\nsteam as it issued from his aunt's teakettle when a little lad barely\r\nbreeched) at an early age he gave evidence of what sort of a man he\r\nwould be. In such a condensed work as the present book, it is impossible\r\nto give much of the life of this celebrated genius; but fortunately\r\nthere are many biographies of him to which the student can refer, as\r\nwell as scientific and other tomes, in which his manifold inventions\r\nhave been recorded, and in no corner of the earth where the steam-engine\r\nhas been introduced can his name be unknown. After many years' labour to\r\nbring the new motive power into practical use, Watt, helped by his\r\nfriend Dr. Roebuck, took out his first patent in 1769. Roebuck's share\r\nwas transferred to Matthew Boulton in 1773, and in the following year\r\nJames Watt came to Birmingham. An Act of Parliament prolonging the\r\npatent for a term of twenty-four years was obtained in May, 1775, and on\r\nthe first of June was commenced the world-famous partnership of Boulton\r\nand Watt. Up to this date the only engine made to work was the one\r\nbrought by Watt from Scotland, though more than nine years had been\r\nspent on it, and thousands of pounds expended in experiments,\r\nimprovements, and alterations. Watt's first residence here was in\r\nRegent's Place, Harper's Hill, to which (Aug. 17, 1775) he brought his\r\nsecond wife. He afterwards removed to Heathfield, where the workshop in\r\nwhich he occupied his latest years still remains, as on the day of his\r\ndeath. In 1785, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society; in 1806,\r\nthe University of Glasgow conferred the degree of LL.D. upon him, and in\r\n1808 he was elected a member of the National Institute of France. One of\r\nthe latest inventions of James Watt was a machine for the mechanical\r\ncopying of sculpture and statuary, its production being the amusement of\r\nhis octogenarian years, for, like his partner Boulton, Watt was\r\npermitted to stay on the earth for longer than the so-called allotted\r\nterm, his death taking place on the 19th of August, 1819, when he was in\r\nhis 83rd year. He was buried in Handsworth Church, where there is a\r\nmonument, the features of which are said to be very like him. A statue\r\nwas erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey in 1824, and others have\r\nbeen set up in Birmingham, Manchester, Greenock, and Glasgow. The\r\nfollowing is the inscription (written by Lord Brougham) on the tomb of\r\nWatt in Westminster Abbey, towards the cost of which George IV.\r\ncontributed £500:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Not to perpetuate a name which must endure while the peaceful arts\r\n  flourish, but to show that mankind have learned to honour those who\r\n  best deserve their gratitude, the King, his ministers, and many of the\r\n  nobles and commoners of the realm, raised this monument to JAMES WATT,\r\n  who, directing the force of an original genius, early exercised in\r\n  philosophical research, to the improvement of the steam-engine,\r\n  enlarged the resources of his country, increased the power of man, and\r\n  rose to an eminent place among the most illustrious followers of\r\n  science and the real benefactors of the world. Born at Greenock, 1736;\r\n  died at Heathfield, in Staffordshire, 1819.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of James Watt's sons, Gregory, who devoted himself to science and\r\nliterature, died in 1804, at the early age of 27. James, born Feb. 5,\r\n1769, resided for a number of years at Aston Hall, where he died in\r\n1848. In 1817 he voyaged to Holland in the first steam vessel that left\r\nan English port, the engines having been manufactured at Soho. He was of\r\na very retiring disposition, and not particularly popular with the\r\npublic, though valued and appreciated by those admitted to closer\r\nintimacy.\r\n\r\n_West_.--Though he did not come to Birmingham until close upon sixty\r\nyears of age, being born in 1770, William West, in his \"History of\r\nWarwickshire,\" published one of the best descriptions of this town ever\r\nyet prepared. He had establishments in London and Cork, and was the\r\nauthor of several amusing and interesting works, such as \"Tavern\r\nAnecdotes,\" \"Fifty Years' Recollections of an Old Bookseller.\" &c., now\r\nscarce, though \"West's Warwickshire\" may often be met with at the\r\n\"Chaucer's Head,\" and other old bookshops.\r\n\r\n_Williams_, Fleetwood, who died in 1836, at the early age of 29, was the\r\nauthor of sundry locally interesting prose works and poetical \"skits.\"\r\nHe was connected with several debating clubs, and showed talent that\r\npromised future distinction.\r\n\r\n_Willmore_.--James Tibbets Willmore, a native of Handsworth, was an\r\neminent landscape engraver, famed for his reproductions of Turner's\r\nworks. His death occurred in March, 1863, in his 63rd year.\r\n\r\n_Winfield_.--Mr. Robert Walter Winfield, though he took comparatively\r\nlittle part in the public life of our town, deserves a prominent place\r\namong our men of note as a manufacturer who did much towards securing\r\nBirmingham a somewhat better name than has occasionally been given it,\r\nin respect to the quality of the work sent out. Starting early in life,\r\nin the military ornament line, Mr. Winfield began in a somewhat small\r\nway on the site of the present extensive block of buildings known as\r\nCambridge Street Works, which has now developed into an establishment\r\ncovering several acres of land. Here have been manufactured some of the\r\nchoicest specimens of brass foundry work that could be desired, no\r\nexpense being spared at any time in the procuring of the best patterns,\r\nand (which is of almost equal importance) the employment of the best\r\nworkmen. The goods sent from Cambridge Street to the first Great\r\nExhibition, 1851, obtained the highest award, the Council's Gold Medal,\r\nfor excellence of workmanship, beauty of design, and general treatment,\r\nand the house retains its position. Mr. Winfield was a true man,\r\nConservative in politics, but most, truly liberal in all matters\r\nconnected with his work-people and their families. In the education and\r\nadvancement of the younger hands he took the deepest interest, spending\r\nthousands in the erection of schools and the appointment of teachers for\r\nthem, and not a few of our present leading men have to thank him for\r\ntheir first step in life. The death of his only son, Mr. J.F. Winfield,\r\nin 1861, was a great blow to the father, and caused him to retire from\r\nactive business through failing health. His death (Dec. 16, 1869), was\r\ngenerally felt as a loss to the town.\r\n\r\n_Wyatt_.--John Wyatt, one of Birmingham's most ingenious sons, invented\r\n(in 1738) the spinning of cotton by means of rollers, but unlike Richard\r\nArkwright, who afterwards introduced a more perfect machine and made a\r\nfortune, the process was never other than a source of loss to the\r\noriginal inventor and his partners, who vainly tried to make it a staple\r\nmanufacture of the town. The weighing machine was also the work of\r\nWyatt's brain, though he did not live to see the machine in use, dying\r\nNov. 29, 1766, broken down by misfortune, but honoured by such men as\r\nBaskerville and Boulton who, then rising themselves, knew the worth of\r\nthe man whose loss they deplored. Wyatt's grave is on the Blue Coat\r\nSchool side of St. Philip's churchyard.\r\n\r\n_Wyon_.--A celebrated local family of die-sinkers and medalists. William\r\nWyon (born in 1795) receiving the gold medal of the Society of Arts, for\r\nhis medal of Ceres, obtained in 1816 the post of second engraver at the\r\nMint, his cousin, Thomas Wyon, being then the chief. One of the finest\r\nmedals engraved by him was that of Boulton, struck by Thomason, in high\r\nrelief, and 4in. in diameter. He died in 1851, having produced all the\r\ncoins and medals for Queen Victoria and William IV., part of George\r\nIV.'s, and prize medals for many societies. His son, Leonard Wyon,\r\nproduced the Exhibition medals in 1851.\r\n\r\nThe preceding are really but a few of the men of note whose connection\r\nwith Birmingham has been of historical interest, and the catalogue might\r\nbe extended to great length with the names of the De Birminghams, the\r\nSmalbrokes, Middlemores, Colmores, and others of the old families alone.\r\nScores of pages would not suffice to give even the shortest biographies\r\nof the many who, by their inventive genius and persistent labour, placed\r\nour town at the head of the world's workshops, the assistants and\r\nfollowers of the great men of Soho, the Thomasons, Taylors, and others\r\nliving in the early part of the century, or the Elkingtons, Chances,\r\n&c., of later days. A volume might easily be filled with lives of\r\nscientific and literary men of the past, Hutton the historian, Morfitt,\r\npoet and barrister; Beilby, Hodgetts, Hudson, and other bookmen, to say\r\nnaught of the many Press writers (who in their day added not a little to\r\nthe advancement of their fellow-townsmen), or the venerable doctors, the\r\nschool teachers and scholars, the pastors and masters of the old School\r\nand the old Hospital. Mention is made of a few here and there in this\r\nbook; of others there have been special histories published, and,\r\nperchance _some_ day \"Birmingham men\" will form the title of a more\r\ncomprehensive work.\r\n\r\n~Novel Sight.~--The appearance in the streets of Birmingham of a real\r\nwar vessel would be a wonderful thing even in these days of railways and\r\nsteam. Sir Rowland Hill, speaking of his childhood's days, said he could\r\nrecollect once during the war with Napoleon that a French gunboat was\r\ndragged across the country, and shown in Birmingham at a small charge.\r\nHe had never then seen any vessel bigger than a coal barge, but this was\r\na real ship, with real anchor and real ship guns.\r\n\r\n~Numbering of Houses.~--We are rapidly improving in many ways, and the\r\ngradual introduction of the system of alternate numbering, the odd\r\nnumbers on one side of the street, and the evens on the other, is an\r\nadvance in the right direction. Still, the fixing of the diminutive\r\nfigure plate on the sideposts of a door, or, as is frequently found to\r\nbe the case, in the shadow of a porch, is very tantalising, especially\r\nto the stranger. Householders should see that the No. is placed in a\r\nconspicuous spot, and have the figures painted so that they can be well\r\nseen even on a dusky evening.\r\n\r\n~Nunneries.~--See \"_Religious Associations_.\"\r\n\r\n~Nurseries.~--The outskirts, and indeed many parts of the town, less\r\nthan a century back were studded with gardens, but the flowers have had\r\nto give place to the more prosaic bricks and mortar, and householders\r\ndesirous of floral ornaments have now in a great measure to resort to\r\nthe nursery grounds of the professed horticulturists. Foremost among the\r\nnurseries of the neighbourhood are those of Mr. R.H. Vertegans, Chad\r\nValley, Edgbaston which were laid out some thirty-five years ago. The\r\nsame gentleman has another establishment of even older date at Malvern,\r\nand a third at Metchley. The grounds of Messrs. Pope and Sons, at King's\r\nNorton, are also extensive and worthy of a visit. There are other\r\nnurseries at Solihull (Mr. Hewitt's), at Spark hill (Mr. Tomkins'), at\r\nHandsworth (Mr. Southhall's), and in several other parts of the suburbs.\r\nThe _Gardeners' Chronicle_, the editor of which is supposed to be a good\r\njudge, said that the floral arrangement at the opening of the Mason\r\nScience College surpassed anything of the kind ever seen in Birmingham,\r\nMr. Vertegans having supplied not less than thirty van loads, comprising\r\nover 5,000 of the choicest exotic flowers and evergreens.\r\n\r\n~Oak Leaf Day.~--In the adjoining counties, and to a certain extent in\r\nBirmingham itself, it has been the custom for carters and coachmen to\r\ndecorate their horses' heads and their own hats with sprays of oak\r\nleaves on the 29th of May, and 99 out of the 100 would tell you they did\r\nso to commemorate Charles II. hiding in the oak tree near to Boscobel\r\nHouse. It is curious to note how long an erroneous idea will last. The\r\nhunted King would not have found much shelter in his historical oak in\r\nthe month of May, as the trees would hardly have been sufficiently in\r\nleaf to have screened him, and, as it happened, it was the 4th of\r\nSeptember and not the 29th of May when the event occurred. The popular\r\nmistake is supposed to have arisen from the fact that Charles made his\r\npublic entry into London on May 29, which was also his birthday, when\r\nthe Royalists decked themselves with oak in remembrance of that tree\r\nhaving been instrumental in the King's restoration.\r\n\r\n~Obsolete Street Names.~--Town improvements of one sort and another have\r\nnecessitated the entire clearance of many streets whose names may be\r\nfound inscribed on the old maps, and their very sites will in time be\r\nforgotten. Changes in name have also occurred more frequently perhaps\r\nthan may be imagined, and it will be well to note a few. As will be\r\nseen, several streets have been christened and re-christened more than\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nBaskerville-street is now Easy-row.\r\n\r\nBath-road is Bristol-street.\r\n\r\nBeast Market was that part of High-street contiguous to New-street; also\r\ncalled English Market.\r\n\r\nBewdley-street, afterwards Ann-street, now Colmore-row.\r\n\r\nBirch Hole-street has been improved to Birchall street.\r\n\r\nBlack Boy Yard is now Jamaica-row.\r\n\r\nBrick Kiln lane is the Horse Fair.\r\n\r\nBroad-street--Dale End was so called in the 15th century.\r\n\r\nBuckle-row. Between Silver-street and Thomas-street.\r\n\r\nButton Alley--Bishop-street, Masshouse-lane.\r\n\r\nButts-lane--Tanter-street; The Butts being Stafford-street.\r\n\r\nCatherine-street--Whittal-street.\r\n\r\nCawsey (The Causeway)--Lower part of Digbeth.\r\n\r\nChapel-street--Bull-street was so called in the 14th century.\r\n\r\nChappel-row--Jennens'-row and Buck-street.\r\n\r\nCharles or Little Charles-street--Now part of New Edmund-street.\r\n\r\nCock-street--Upper part of Digbeth; also called Well-street.\r\n\r\nColmore-street--From Worcester-street to Peck-lane.\r\n\r\nCony Greve street is now Congreve-street.\r\n\r\nCooper's Mill-lane is Heathmill-lane.\r\n\r\nCorbett's Alley--Union-street.\r\n\r\nCorn Cheaping or Corn Market was part of the Bull Ring.\r\n\r\nCourt-lane--Moat-lane.\r\n\r\nCottage-lane--Sheepcote-lane.\r\n\r\nCrescent-street--Part of King Edward's Road.\r\n\r\nCross-street--Vauxhall-street.\r\n\r\nCrown-street, afterwards Nelson-street is now Sheepcote-street.\r\n\r\nDeadman's Lane--Warstone-lane.\r\n\r\nDitch--The Gullet was The Ditch.\r\n\r\nDock Alley--New Inkleys.\r\n\r\nDudwall-lane--Dudley-street\r\n\r\nFarmer-street--Sand-street.\r\n\r\nFerney Fields--Great Hampton-street\r\n\r\nFeck-lane or Peck-lane--Covered by New-street Station.\r\n\r\nGod's Cart-lane--Carrs-lane.\r\n\r\nGrindstone-lane--Westfield-road.\r\n\r\nHangman's-lane, or Hay Barns-lane--Great Hampton-row.\r\n\r\nHarlow-street--Edmund-street.\r\n\r\nHaymarket--one of the names given to Ann-street.\r\n\r\nHigh Town--Upper part of Bull Ring.\r\n\r\nHill-street--Little Charles-street.\r\n\r\nJennings-street--Fox-street.\r\n\r\nKing-street and Queen-street, as well as Great Queen-street, have made\r\nway for New-street Station.\r\n\r\nLake Meadow-hill--Bordesley-street and Fazeley-street.\r\n\r\nLamb-yard--Crooked-lane.\r\n\r\nLong-lane--Harborne-road.\r\n\r\nLudgate-hill was part of Church-street.\r\n\r\nMartin-street--Victoria-street.\r\n\r\nMercer-street, or Spicer-street--Spiceal-street.\r\n\r\nMount Pleasant--Ann-street.\r\n\r\nNew road--Summer-row.\r\n\r\nOld Meeting-street has at various periods been known as Grub-street,\r\nLittleworth street, New-row, and Phillips-street.\r\n\r\nPemberton's-yard, Lower Minories, or Coach-yard--Dalton-street.\r\n\r\nPitt-street and Porter-street were portions of Old Cross-street.\r\n\r\nPriors Conigree-lane, or Whitealls-lane is now Steelhouse-lane.\r\n\r\nPriory-lane--Monmouth-street.\r\n\r\nRother Market--New-street next to High-street and High-street next to\r\nNew-street was once so called.\r\n\r\nSandy-lane--Snow Hill in the 16th century. Lee Bank-road has also been\r\ncalled Sandy-lane.\r\n\r\nShambles--Part of Bull Ring.\r\n\r\nSwan Alley--Worcester-street.\r\n\r\nSwinford-street--Upper end of New-street.\r\n\r\nTemple Alley, also called Tory-row--Temple-row.\r\n\r\nWalmer-lane (in the 15th century Wold Moors)--Lancaster-street.\r\n\r\nWater-street--Floodgate-street.\r\n\r\nWelch End or Welch Market--Junction of Bull-street, High-street, and\r\nDale End.\r\n\r\nWestley's-row, Westley-street, or London 'Prentice-street forms part of\r\nDalton-street.\r\n\r\nWithering-street--Union-street.\r\n\r\nWyllattes Green--Prospect Row.\r\n\r\n~Old Cock Pump.~--This was the old pump formerly under St. Martin's\r\nChurchyard wall, from which the water-carriers and others obtained their\r\nsupply of drinking water. The rule of the pump was \"last come last\r\nserved,\" and frequently a long string of men, women, and children might\r\nbe seen waiting their turn. Many of us can recollect the old Digbeth\r\nmen, with their shoulder-yoke and two buckets, plodding along to find\r\ncustomers for their \"Wartâ;\" and certain elderly ladies are still in\r\nexistence who would fear the shortening of their lives were their\r\ntea-kettles filled with aught but the pure Digbeth water, though it does\r\nnot come from the pump at St. Martin's, for that was removed in 1873. It\r\nhas been written that on one occasion (in the days before waterworks\r\nwere practicable, and the old pump was a real blessing), when the poor\r\nfolks came to fill their cans early in the morning, they found the\r\nhandle gone, and great was the outcry thereat. It soon afterwards\r\ntranspired that a blacksmith, short of iron, had taken the handle to\r\nmake into horseshoes.\r\n\r\n~Old Meeting House Yard.~--The name gives its own origin. One of the\r\nearliest built of our Dissenting places of worship was here situated.\r\n\r\n~Old Square.~--There are grounds for believing that this was the site of\r\nthe Hospital or Priory of St. Thomas the Apostle; the reason of no\r\nfoundations or relics of that building having been come across arising\r\nfrom its having been erected on a knoll or mount there, and which would\r\nbe the highest bit of land in Birmingham. This opinion is borne out by\r\nthe fact that the Square was originally called The Priory, and doubtless\r\nthe Upper and Lower Priories and the Minories of later years were at\r\nfirst but the entrance roads to the old Hospital, as it was most\r\nfrequently styled in deeds and documents. Mr. John Pemberton, who\r\npurchased this portion of the Priory lands in 1697, and laid it out for\r\nbuilding, would naturally have it levelled, and, not unlikely from a\r\nreverent feeling, so planned that the old site of the religious houses\r\nshould remain clear and undesecrated. From old conveyances we find that\r\n20s. per yard frontage was paid for the site of some of the houses in\r\nthe square, and up to 40s. in Bull Street; the back plots, including the\r\nFriends' burial ground (once gardens to the front houses) being valued\r\nat 1s. to 2s. per yard. Some of the covenants between the vendor and the\r\npurchasers are very curious, such as that the latter \"shall and will for\r\never hereafter putt and keep good bars of iron or wood, or otherwise\r\nsecure all the lights and windows that are or shall be, that soe any\r\nchildren or others may not or cannot creep through, gett, or come\r\nthrough such lights or windows into or upon the same piece of land.\"\r\nHere appears the motive for the erection of the iron railings so closely\r\nplaced in front of the old houses. Another covenant was against \"putting\r\nthere any muckhill or dunghill places, pigstyes or workhouses, shopps or\r\nplaces that shall he noysome or stink, or be nautionse or troublesome,\"\r\nand also to have there \"no butcher's or smith's slaughter house or\r\nsmithey harth.\" One of the corner houses, originally called \"the Angle\r\nHouse,\" was sold in 1791 for £420; in 1805 it realised £970; in 1843,\r\n£1,330? and in 1853, £2,515. The centre of the Square was enclosed and\r\nneatly kept as a garden with walks across, for the use of the\r\ninhabitants there, but (possibly it was \"nobody's business\") in course\r\nof time it became neglected, and we have at least one instance, in 1832,\r\nof its being the scene of a public demonstration. About the time of the\r\nParliamentary election in that year, the carriageway round the Square\r\nhad been newly macadamised, and on the polling day, when Dempster Heming\r\nopposed William Stratford Dugdale, the stones were found very handy, and\r\nwere made liberal use of, as per the usual order of the day at that time\r\non such occasions. The trees and railings were removed in 1836 or 1837\r\nin consequence of many accidents occurring there, the roadways being\r\nnarrow and very dangerous from the numerous angles, the Street\r\nCommissioners undertaking to give the inhabitants a wide and handsome\r\nflagging as a footpath on all sides of the square, conditionally with\r\nthe freeholders of the property giving up their rights to and share in\r\nthe enclosure.\r\n\r\n~Omnibuses.~--The first omnibus was started in 1828, by Mr. Doughty, a\r\nfishmonger, and its route lay between the White Swan, Snow Hill, to the\r\nSun, in Bristol Road. In 1836 an \"Omnibus Conveyance Co,\" was proposed,\r\nwith a magnificent capital of £5,000. The projectors would have been a\r\nlittle startled if they could have seen the prospectuses of some of our\r\nmodern conveyance companies.--See \"_Tramways_.\"\r\n\r\n~Open Spaces.~--March 8, 1883, saw the formation of the Birmingham\r\nAssociation for the Prevention of Open Spaces and Public Footpaths, the\r\nobject of which is to be the securing of the rights of the public to the\r\nopen spots, footpaths, and green places, which, for generations, have\r\nbelonged to them. There are few such left in the borough now, but the\r\nAssociation may find plenty to do in the near neighbourhood, and if its\r\nmembers can but save us one or two of the old country walks they will do\r\ngood service to the community.\r\n\r\n~Orange Tree.~--This public-house was built in 1780, the neighbourhood\r\nbeing then known as \"Boswell Heath.\" A walk to the Orange Tree over the\r\n\"hilly fields,\" where Conybere and other streets now are, was a pleasant\r\nSunday morning ramble even forty years back.\r\n\r\n~Oratory.~--See \"_Places of Worship_.\"\r\n\r\n~Organs.~--According to the oft-quoted extract from the Halesowen\r\nChurchwardens' books--\"1497. Paid for repeyling the organs to the organ\r\nmaker at Bromycham 10s,\"--organ-building must have been one of the few\r\nrecognised trades of this town at a very early date. It is a pity the\r\nsame accounts do not give the maker's name of the instruments for which\r\nin 1539 they \"paid my lord Abbot 4 marks,\" or name the parties who were\r\nthen employed and paid for \"mending and setting the organs up, 40s.\"\r\nWhether any of the most celebrated organs in the country have, or have\r\nnot, been made here, is quite uncertain, though the Directories and\r\npapers of all dates tell us that makers thereof have never been wanting.\r\nIn 1730, one Thomas Swarbrick made the organ for St. Mary's Church,\r\nWarwick, and the Directory for 1836 gives the name of Isaac Craddock\r\n(the original maker of the taper penholder), who repaired and in several\r\ncases enlarged the instruments at many of our places of worship, as well\r\nas supplying the beautiful organ for St. Mary's, at Coventry.--The tale\r\nhas often been told of the consternation caused by the introduction of a\r\nbarrel organ into a church, when from some catch or other it would not\r\nstop at the finish of the first tune, and had to be carried outside,\r\nwhile the remainder of its repertoire pealed forth, but such instruments\r\nwere not unknown in sacred edifices in this neighbourhood but a short\r\ntime back [see \"_Northfield_\"].--A splendid organ was erected in Broad\r\nStreet Music Hall when it was opened, and it was said to be the second\r\nlargest in England, costing £2,000; it was afterwards purchased for St.\r\nPancras' Church, London.--The organ in the Town Hall, constructed by Mr.\r\nHill, of London, cost nearly £4,000 and, when put up, was considered to\r\nbe one of the finest and most powerful in the world, and it cannot have\r\nlost much of its prestige, as many improvements have since been made in\r\nit. The outer case is 45ft. high, 40ft. wide, and 17ft. deep, and the\r\ntimber used in the construction of the organ weighed nearly 30 tons.\r\nThere are 4 keyboards, 71 draw stops, and over 4,000 pipes of various\r\nforms and sizes, some long, some short, some trumpet-like in shape, and\r\nothers cylindrical, while in size they range from two or three inches in\r\nlength to the great pedal pipe, 32ft. high and a yard in width, with an\r\ninterior capacity of 224 cubic feet. In the \"great organ\" there are 18\r\nstops, viz.: Clarion (2ft.), ditto (4ft.), posanne, trumpet, principal\r\n(1 and 2), gamba, stopped diapason, four open diapasons, doublette,\r\nharmonic flute, mixture sesquialtra, fifteenth, and twelfth, containing\r\naltogether 1,338 pipes. In the \"choir organ\" there are nine stops, viz.:\r\nWald flute, fifteenth stopped flute, oboe flute, principal, stopped\r\ndiapason, hohl flute, cornopean, and open diapason, making together 486\r\npipes. The \"swell organ\" contains 10 stops, viz.: Hautbois, trumpet,\r\nhorn, fifteenth, sesquialtra, principal, stopped diapason, open\r\ndiapason, clarion, and boureon and dulciana, the whole requiring 702\r\npipes. In the \"solo organ\" the principal stops are the harmonica, krum,\r\nhorn, and flageolet, but many of the stops in the swell and choir organs\r\nwork in connection with the solo. In the \"pedal organ\" are 12 stops,\r\nviz.: Open diapason 16ft. (bottom octave) wood, ditto, 16ft., metal,\r\nditto, 16ft. (bottom octave) metal, bourdon principal, twelfth,\r\nfifteenth, sesquialtra, mixture, posanne, 8ft. trumpet, and 4ft.\r\ntrumpet. There are besides, three 32ft. stops, one wood, one metal, and\r\none trombone. There are four bellows attached to the organ, and they are\r\nof great size, one being for the 32ft. pipes alone. The Town Hall organ\r\nhad its first public trial August 29, 1834, when the Birmingham Choral\r\nSociety went through a selection of choruses, as a kind of advance note\r\nof the then coming Festival.\r\n\r\nOrphanages.--The first local establishment of the nature of an orphanage\r\nwas the so called Orphan Asylum in Summer Lane, built in 1797 for the\r\nrearing of poor children from the Workhouse. It was a very useful\r\ninstitution up to the time of its close in 1852, but like the Homes at\r\nMarston Green, where the young unfortunates from the present Workhouse\r\nare reared and trained to industrial habits, it was almost a misnomer to\r\ndub it an \"orphan asylum.\"--An Orphanage at Erdington was begun by the\r\nlate Sir Josiah Mason, in 1858, in connection with his Almshouses there,\r\nit being his then intention to find shelter for some three score of the\r\naged and infantile \"waifs and strays\" of humanity. In 1860 he extended\r\nhis design so far as to commence the present Orphanage, the foundation\r\nstone of which was laid by himself Sept. 19 in that year, the building\r\nbeing finished and first occupied in 1863. In addition to the\r\nexpenditure of £60,000 on the buildings, the founder endowed the\r\ninstitution with land and property to the value of £250,000. No\r\npublicity was given to this munificent benevolence until the twelve\r\nmonths prescribed by the statute had elapsed after the date of the deed,\r\nwhen, on the 29th of July, 1869, the Orphanage and estates were handed\r\nover to seven trustees, who, together with Sir Josiah himself, formed\r\nthe first Board of Management. At his death, as provided by the trust\r\ndeed, seven other trustees chosen by the Birmingham Town Council were\r\nadded to the Board. The inmates of the Orphanage are lodged, clothed,\r\nfed, maintained, educated, and brought up at the exclusive cost of the\r\ninstitution, there being no restriction whatever as to locality,\r\nnationality, or religious persuasion of parents or friends. In 1874 the\r\nbuilding was enlarged, so as to accommodate 300 girls, 150 boys, and 50\r\ninfants, the original part being reserved for the girls and infants and\r\na new wing built for the boys. The two are connected by the lofty dining\r\nhall, 200ft. long, with tables and seats for 500 children. Every part of\r\nthe establishment is on a liberal scale and fitted with the best\r\nappliances; each child has its separate bed, and the playgrounds are\r\nmost extensive.--The Princess Alice Orphanage, of which the\r\nfoundation-stone was laid Sept. 19, 1882, has rather more than a\r\nBirmingham interest, as it is intended in the first instance for the\r\nreception of children from all parts of the country whose parents have\r\nbeen Wesleyans. In connection with the Wesleyan Thanksgiving Fund, Mr.\r\nSolomon Jevons, of this town, made an offer to the committee that if\r\nfrom the fund they would make a grant of £10,000 towards establishing an\r\norphanage in the neighbourhood of Birmingham, he would supplement it by\r\na donation of £10,000. After due consideration the offer was accepted.\r\nPlans were prepared by Mr. J.L. Ball for as much of the building as it\r\nwas proposed immediately to erect, and the contract was let to Messrs.\r\nJ. Wilson and Sons, of Handsworth. The sanction of her Majesty the Queen\r\nwas obtained to call the building the \"Princess Alice\" Orphanage, in\r\nmemory of her lamented daughter, the late Princess of Hesse. The site\r\nchosen is about halfway between Erdington and Sutton Coldfield on the\r\nChester Road, and very near to the \"Beggar's Bush.\" Facing the road,\r\nthough forty yards from it, is the central block of buildings, 250 feet\r\nin length, including the master's house, board room and offices, store\r\nrooms, &c., with a large hall, 90 feet by 33 feet, for use as a dining\r\nhall, general gatherings, morning prayers, &c., the children's homes\r\nbeing in cottages at varying distances, so that when the whole\r\ntwenty-four homes (twelve each for boys and girls) are erected it will\r\nbe like a miniature village, sundry farm buildings and workshops being\r\ninterspersed here and there. Each cottage is intended to be the home of\r\nabout twenty children, but at first, and until the funds for the\r\nmaintenance of the orphanage have been increased, the inmates will be\r\nlimited to the accommodation that can be provided at the central block\r\nand the nearest two or three homes, the rest being built as occasion\r\noffers.\r\n\r\n~Oscott College.~--See \"_Schools_,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Oxford, (Edward).~--The boy Oxford who shot at the Queen, on June 10,\r\n1840, was born here and had worked at several shops in the town.\r\n\r\n~Oxygen.~--It was on the first of August, 1774, that Dr. Priestley\r\ndiscovered the nature of oxygen or \"dephlogisticated air.\" If he could\r\nvisit Oxygen Street in this town in August of any year, he would\r\nprobably say that the air there to be breathed required\r\ndephlogisticating over and over again.\r\n\r\n~Packhorses.~--In and about the year 1750 the only method of conveying\r\nparcels of goods from here to London was by means of packhorses, the\r\ncharge being at the rate of £7 to £9 per ton; to Liverpool and Bristol,\r\n£5.\r\n\r\n~Panorama.~--A circular erection in New Street, and now partly\r\nincorporated in the Society of Artists building, where early in the\r\ncentury panoramas of various kinds were exhibited.\r\n\r\n~Panoramic View.~--A peculiar view of this town was published in 1847 by\r\nAckermann of London, and was thus called, as it purported to give the\r\nthoroughfares pictorially, showing the houses as they would appear from\r\na balloon over Moseley Street. The size was 27-1/2 in. by 14-3/4 in. As\r\na curiosity it is prizable, but its correctness of delineation is marred\r\nvery much by the plan adopted.\r\n\r\n~Pantechnetheca.~--A large place of general business, opened in 1824, at\r\nthe New-street end of Union-passage. In 1817, there stood on this spot a\r\npublichouse, known as the \"Old Crown,\" the entrance to which was in a\r\nlarge, open gateway at its side, through which a path led to the cherry\r\norchard. The Pantechnetheca was one of \"the sights\" of the town, the\r\nexterior being ornamented with pillars and statues; while the name was\r\nnot only a puzzle to the \"Black Country\" visitors, but quite a subject\r\nof dispute as to its etymology among the Greek scholars of the Grammar\r\nSchool opposite.\r\n\r\n~Paradise Street.~--The footpath on the Town Hall side used to be\r\nseveral feet higher than the causeway, and was supplied with iron\r\nrailings. If the name had been given in late years, it might be supposed\r\nto have been chosen because the doors of the Parish Offices are in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n~Parish Offices.~--See \"_Public Buildings_.\"\r\n\r\n~Parkesine.~--A material used for knife handles and other purposes, so\r\nnamed after its maker, Alexander Parkes, a well-known local\r\nmanufacturer, who said it was made from refuse vegetable fibre,\r\npyroxyline, oil, naphtha, and chloride of sulphur.\r\n\r\n~Park Lane.~--From Aston Cross Tavern to the Birchfield Road, originally\r\nbeing the road outside the wall of Aston Park. The first lots of land\r\nfor building that were sold were those fronting Church Lane, and they\r\nfetched an average price of 2s. 2d. per yard, each lot being 12 yards by\r\n60 yards. The next were the lots marked out by the side of Park Lane,\r\nand it was at about the middle of Park Lane that the first house was\r\nbuilt in Aston Park in 1854 or 1855.\r\n\r\n~Park Road.~--Leading over the hill from Aston Cross to Aston Church,\r\nwas the first laid out, and the first opened to the public (Easter\r\nMonday, 1855) through the old grounds belonging to the Holts.\r\n\r\n~Parks.~--Thanks to the munificence of Miss Ryland, Lord Calthorpe, Sir\r\nCharles Adderley, and Mr. W. Middlemore, with the concurrent generosity\r\nof the Church authorities, in whom the freehold of our churchyards was\r\ninvested, Birmingham cannot be said to be short of parks and public\r\ngrounds, though with all put together the area is nothing like that\r\ntaken from the inhabitants under the Enclosures Acts of last century.\r\nThe first movement for the acquisition of public parks took the shape of\r\na town's meeting, Dec. 22, 1853, when the burgesses approved the\r\npurchase, and in 1854 an Act was obtained for the formation thereof. The\r\nfirst to be opened was Adderley Park, Aug. 30, 1856, the gift of Sir\r\nCharles Adderley. Its area is 10A. Or. 22P., and it is held nominally on\r\na 999 years' lease, at a rental of 5s. per year. Calthorpe Park was\r\nopened June 1, 1857; its area being 31A. 1R. 13P., and it is held under\r\na grant by the Calthorpe family that is equivalent to a conveyance in\r\nfee. Aston Park was opened Sept. 22, 1864; its area is 49A. 2R. 8P., and\r\nit belongs to the town by purchase. Cannon Hill Park, the gift of Miss\r\nRyland, was opened Sept. 1, 1873; its area being 57A. 1R. 9P. In 1874,\r\nthe Town Council gave the Trustees of Holliers' Charity the sum of\r\n£8,300 for the 8A. 8R. 28P. of land situated between the Moseley Road\r\nand Alcester Street, and after expending over £5,400 in laying out,\r\nfencing, and planting, opened it as Highgate Park June 2, 1876. In 1876\r\nSummerfield House and grounds covering 12A. 0R. 20P. were purchased from\r\nMr. Henry Weiss for £9,000, and after fencing, &c., was thrown open as\r\nSummerfield Park, July 29, 1876. In the following year, Mr. William\r\nMiddlemore presented to the town a plot of ground, 4A. 1R. 3p. in\r\nextent, in Burbury Street, having spent about £3,500 in fencing and\r\nlaying it out, principally as a recreation ground for children (the\r\ntotal value being over £12,000), and it was opened as Hockley Park,\r\nDecember 1, 1877.--Small Heath Park, comprising 41A. 3R. 34p., is\r\nanother of the gifts of Miss Ryland, who presented it to the town June\r\n2, 1876, and in addition provided £4,000 of the £10,000 the Town Council\r\nexpended in laying it out. The formal opening ceremony took place April\r\n5, 1879. There are still several points of the compass directing to\r\nsuburbs which would be benefited by the appropriation of a little\r\nbreathing place or two, and possibly in due time they will be acquired.\r\nThe Nechells people have had laid out for their delectation the waste\r\nground near the gas works which may be called Nechells Park for the time\r\nbeing. The Earl of Dartmouth in June, 1878, gave 56 acres out of\r\nSandwell Park to the inhabitants of West Bromwich, and they call it\r\nDartmouth Park.\r\n\r\n~Park Street~ takes its name from the small park or wood surrounding\r\nPark House, once existing somewhere near to the burial ground.\r\n\r\n~Park Street Gardens~--As they are now called, comprise the Park Street\r\nBurial Ground and St. Bartholomew's Churchyard, the possession of which\r\n(under a nominal lease for 999 years) was given by the Rectors of St.\r\nMartin's and St. Bartholomew's to the Corporation according to the\r\nprovisions of the Closed Burial Grounds Act. The whole area included a\r\nlittle over five acres, and the size thus given was valued at £50,000.\r\nAbout half an acre was devoted to the widening of the surrounding\r\nstreets, the remainder being properly fenced in and laid out as\r\nrecreating grounds and gardens. The opening ceremony took place, June\r\n25, 1880.\r\n\r\n~Parliamentary Elections.~--Notwithstanding the safeguards provided by\r\nthe Ballot Act, and all the deterrent measures enacted against bribery\r\nand intimidation, and those peculiar tactics known as \"getting up\r\nsteam,\" the period of an election for Parliamentary representatives is a\r\ntime of great excitement even in these days. But it is comparatively\r\nnaught to what it used to be, when the art of kidnapping Tory voters, or\r\n\"bottling\" Whigs, was considered as only a small part of the education\r\nrequired by aspiring political agents. Leading burly prizefighters to\r\nclear the hustings on nomination day, upsetting carriages containing\r\nvoters going to poll, and such like practical jokes were all _en regle_,\r\nand as such \"goings-on\" were to be found as much on the one side as the\r\nother, neither party's pot had a right to call the opponent's kettle\r\nblack. Prior to the enfranchisement of the borough, one of the most\r\nexciting elections in which the Brums had been engaged was that for the\r\ncounty of Warwick in 1774, when Sir Charles Holte, of Aston Hall, was\r\nreturned. The nomination took place Oct. 13, the candidates being Mr.\r\nShipworth (a previous member), Mr. (afterwards Lord) Mordaunt, and Sir\r\nCharles, who for once pleased the Birmingham folks by calling himself an\r\n\"Independent.\" The polling, which commenced on the 20th, was continued\r\nfor ten days, closing on the 31st, and as Mr. Mordaunt had the lead for\r\nmany days the excitement was intense, and the rejoicings proportionate\r\nat the end when the local candidate came in with flying colours. The\r\nvoting ran:--Shipwith, 2,954; Holte, 1,845; Mordaunt, 1,787.--A\r\nBirmingham man was a candidate at the next great county contest,\r\nforty-six years after. This was Mr. Richard Spooner, then (1820) a young\r\nman and of rather Radical tendencies. His opponent, Mr. Francis Lawley,\r\nwas of the old-fashioned Whig party, and the treatment his supporters\r\nreceived at the hands of the Birmingham and Coventry people was\r\ndisgraceful. Hundreds of special constables had to be sworn in at\r\nWarwick during the fourteen days' polling, business being suspended for\r\ndays together, but Radical Richard's roughs failed to influence the\r\nelection, as Mr. Lawley obtained 2,153 votes against Mr. Spooner's 970.\r\nAs Mr. Spooner grew older he became more prominent in commercial\r\ncircles, and was peculiarly _au fait_ in all currency matters, but he\r\nlost his hold on local electors by turning to the Conservative side of\r\npolitics. Of this he was more than once reminded in after years, when\r\nspeaking in the Town Hall, by individuals taking off their coats,\r\nturning them inside out, and having put them on again, standing\r\nprominently in front of \"Yellow Dick\" as they then called him.\r\n\r\nThat the inhabitants of Birmingham, so rapidly increasing in numbers and\r\nwealth, should be desirous of direct representation in the House of\r\nCommons, could be no wonder even to the most bigoted politicians of the\r\nlast and early part of the present century. Possibly, had there been '91\r\nRiots, nor quite so much \"tall talk,\" the Legislature might have\r\nvouchsafed us a share in the manufacture of our country's laws a little\r\nearlier than they did, and the attempt to _force_ a member through the\r\ndoors of the House could not have added to any desire that may have\r\nexisted in the minds of the gentlemen inside to admit the representative\r\nof Birmingham. The Newhall Hill meeting of July 12th, 1819, may be\r\nreckoned as the first pitched battle between the invaders and defenders\r\nof the then existing Parliamentary Constitution. The appointment of Sir\r\nCharles Wolesey as \"Legislatorial Attorney and Representative,\" with\r\ninstructions to take his seat as M.P. for the town (and many so styled\r\nhim), even though made at a meeting of 20,000 would-be electors, does\r\nnot appear to have been the wisest way to have gone to work,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that Sir Charles himself said _he_ had no doubt\r\nof their right to send him up as their Member. Prosecution of the\r\nleaders followed, as a matter of course, and if the\r\ntwenty-and-odd-thousands of the local Conservative electors of to-day\r\nwere thus to try to obtain _their_ due share of representation in the\r\nHouse, most likely the leaders of such a movement would be as liberally\r\ndealt with. The \"battle of freedom,\" as the great Reform movement came\r\nto be called, has often been described, and honour been given to all who\r\ntook part in it. The old soldiers of the campaign should be allowed, if\r\nthey choose, to \"fight their battles o'er again,\" as long as they live,\r\nbut it is about time that the hatchet of party spite, (hitherto so\r\nfreely used in local political warfare) was buried out of sight, and all\r\nsides be as willing to give equal rights as their fathers were to fight\r\nfor theirs. Birmingham, however, was not without _some_ friends in\r\nParliament, and on the occasion of the disfranchisement of the borough\r\nof East Retford in 1827, it was proposed by Mr. Charles Tennyson that\r\nthe two seats thus voided should be given to Birmingham. Mr. George\r\nAttwood was High Bailiff at the time, and he at once called a public\r\nmeeting to support Mr. Tennyson's proposition by petition. The Public\r\nOffice was not large enough for those who attended the meeting (June 22,\r\n1827) and they adjourned to Beardsworth's Repository, where speeches\r\nwere delivered by the leading men of all parties. Petitions to both\r\nHouses were drawn up and signed, the county members, Dugdale Stratford\r\nDugdale and Francis Lawley, Esqrs., being asked to introduce the one to\r\nthe House of Commons, and Lord Dudley and Ward (Baron of Birmingham) and\r\nLord Calthorpe to support the petitioners' prayer in the Upper House.\r\nMr. Tennyson (who afterwards took the name of D'Eyncourt) brought in his\r\nBill, but notwithstanding all that could be said or done by the friends\r\nof the town they were outvoted (March 21, 1828), and the Bill was thrown\r\nout. The next four years were full of trouble, and the news of the\r\npassing of the Reform Bill (June 7, 1832), which at last gave Birmingham\r\nits long-sought political rights was most welcome indeed. The first\r\nelection day was fixed for December 12, and for some time it was\r\nrumoured that Mr. Richard Spooner would stand in opposition to Messrs.\r\nThomas Attwood and Joshua Scholefield, the chosen representatives of the\r\nLiberals; but the Conservative party, deeming it but right that those\r\nwho had borne the brunt of the constitutional fight should be allowed\r\nthe first honours of the local victory, declined to oppose those\r\ngentlemen, and they were accordingly returned without opposition. The\r\nhustings had been erected on a plot of land opposite the Public Offices\r\nand here the nominations took place at the early hour of 8 a.m. The\r\nproceedings were over by nine o'clock, but the \"victory,\" as the popular\r\nparty chose to consider it, did not satisfy them, and as there was an\r\nelection on at Walsall the same day it was determined that the\r\nBirmingham Liberals should go there to help Mr. Bosco Attwood in his\r\ncontest with Mr. Foster. A procession of some thousands, with bands and\r\nbanners, according marched the whole of the distance so Walsall, and if\r\ntheir behaviour there represented what they were prepared to do at home\r\nhad they not been allowed to have their own way, it was well for\r\nBirmingham they were not opposed. Long before evening this town was in\r\nthe most fearful excitement, the passengers and guards of the various\r\ncoaches which had passed through Walsall bringing the direst news of\r\nfire and riot, mixed with reports of the military being called out and\r\nfiring on the people, numbers being killed, &c. Fortunately there was\r\nmuch exaggeration in these tales, and by degrees most of the Birmingham\r\nmen found their way home, though many were in sad plight through the\r\noutrageous behaviour of themselves and the \"victorious\" crew who went\r\noff so gaily with them in the morning. The elections in after years may\r\nbe briefly chronicled.\r\n\r\n1835.--At the general election, which occurred this year, the Town Hall\r\nwas first used as the place of nomination (Jan. 7th). During the\r\nproceedings the front of the great gallery gave way and precipitated\r\nthose sitting there on to the heads of the people below, but\r\nprovidentially, the injuries received were not of a serious character.\r\nMr. R. Spooner was most impatiently heard, and the show of hands was\r\ndecidedly against him. The state of the poll showed:--\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Attwood    1,718 votes }\r\nJoshua Scholefidd 1,660   \"   } Returned.\r\nRichard Spooner     915   \"\r\n\r\n\r\n1837, August.--At this election the\r\nlate sitting members were opposed\r\nby Mr. A. G. Stapleton, but unsuccessfully,\r\nthe voting being\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Attwood       .. 2,145 }\r\nJoshua Scholefield   .. 2,114 }Returned.\r\nA.G. Stapleton       .. 1,046\r\n\r\n\r\n1840, January.--Mr. Attwood having resigned, Sir Charles Wetherell\r\nappeared in the Conservative interest against Mr. G.F. Muntz. Mr. Joseph\r\nSturge, who also issued an address to the electors, retiring on the\r\nsolicitation of his friends, on the understanding that the whole Liberal\r\nparty would support him at the next vacancy. The result was in favour of\r\nMr. Muntz, thus--\r\n\r\n\r\nGeo. Fred. Muntz     .. 1,454--Returned.\r\nSir C. Wetherell     ..   915\r\n\r\n\r\n1841, July.--Mr. Richard Spooner, who opposed Messrs. Muntz and\r\nScholefield, was again defeated, through receiving the suffrages of\r\ndouble the number of electors who voted for him in 1835. The returns\r\nwere--\r\n\r\n\r\nGeo. Fred. Muntz     .. 2,176 }\r\nJoshua Scholefield   .. 1,963 }Returned.\r\nRichard Spooner      .. 1,825\r\n\r\n\r\n1857, March.--The same gentlemen were again returned without opposition.\r\n\r\n1857, August.--On the death of Mr. Muntz, though the names of George\r\nDawson and others were whispered, the unanimous choice fell upon Mr.\r\nJohn Bright, \"the rejected of Manchester,\" and it may be truly said he\r\nwas at that time the chosen of the people. Birmingham men of all shades\r\nof politics appreciating his eloquence and admiring his sterling\r\nhonesty, though many differed with his opinions. Addresses were early\r\nissued by Baron Dickenson Webster and Mr. M'Geachy, but both were at\r\nonce withdrawn when Mr. Bright consented to stand and _his_ address\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n1859, April.--At the election of this year, though defeat must have been\r\na foregone conclusion, Mr. Thomas D. Acland waged battle with Messrs.\r\nScholefield and Bright, and the result was:--\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Scholefield ..  ..4,425 }\r\nJohn Bright     ..  ..  ..4,282 }Returned.\r\nT.D. Acland     ..  ..  ..1,544\r\n\r\n\r\n1864, December.--On the death of Mr. Spooner, Mr. Davenport-Bromley,\r\n(afterwards Bromley-Davenport) was elected un-opposed, and retained his\r\nseat until his death, June 15, 1884.\r\n\r\n1864.--Householders, whose rates were compounded for by their landlords,\r\nhad hitherto not been allowed to exercise their right of voting, but the\r\ndecision given in their favour, Feb. 17, 1864, was the means of raising\r\nthe number of voters' names on the register to over 40,000.\r\n\r\n1865, July.--Whether from fear of the newly-formed Liberal Association\r\n(which was inaugurated in February for the avowed purpose of controlling\r\nthe Parliamentary elections in the borough and adjoining county\r\ndivisions), or the lack of a sufficiently popular local man, there was\r\nno opposition offered to the return of Messrs. Scholefield and Bright at\r\nthe election of this year.\r\n\r\n1867, July.--On the death of Mr. Scholefield, Mr. George Dixon was\r\nnominated by the Liberals and opposed by Mr. Sampson S. Lloyd The result\r\nwas:--\r\n\r\n\r\nGeo. Dixon   ..  ..  ..  ..5,819  Returned.\r\nS.S. Lloyd   ..  ..  ..  ..4,214\r\n\r\n\r\n1868, November.--This was the first election after the passing of the\r\nReform Bill of 1867, by which Birmingham became entitled to send three\r\nmembers to the House of Commons; and as the Bill contained a proviso\r\n(generally known as the \"minority clause\") that each voter should be\r\nlimited to giving his support to two only of the candidates, an immense\r\namount of interest was taken in the interest that ensued. The\r\nConservatives brought forward Mr. Sampson S. Lloyd and Mr. Sebastian\r\nEvans, the Liberal Association nominating Messrs. John Bright, George\r\nDixon, and Philip Henry Muntz (brother to the old member G.F. Muntz).\r\nThe election has become historical from the cleverly-manipulated scheme\r\ndevised by the Liberal Association, and the strict enforcement of their\r\n\"vote-as-you're-told\" policy, by which, abnegating all personal freedom\r\nor choice in the matter the electors under the influence of the\r\nAssociation were moved at the will of the chiefs of their party. That\r\nthe new tactics were successful is shown by the returns:--\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Dixon   ..  ..  ..  15,188 }\r\nP.H. Muntz     ..  ..  ..  14,614 }Returned.\r\nJohn Bright    ..  ..  ..  14,601 }\r\nS.S. Lloyd     ..  ..  ..   8,700\r\nS. Evans       ..  ..  ..   7,061\r\n\r\n\r\n1868, Dec. 21.--Mr. Bright having been appointed President of the Board\r\nof Trade, was re-elected without opposition. He held office till the\r\nclose of 1870, but for a long time was absent from Parliament through\r\nillness.\r\n\r\n1873, Aug. 6.--Mr. John Jaffray, one of the proprietors of the _Daily\r\nPost_, contested East Staffordshire against Mr. Allsopp, but he only\r\nobtained 2,893 votes, as against Mr. Allsopp's 3,630.\r\n\r\n1873, Oct. 18.--Soon after recovery of health Mr. Bright returned to his\r\nseat, and being appointed to the office of the Chancellor of the Duchy\r\nof Lancaster, was re-elected in due course.\r\n\r\n1874, Jan. 30.--No opposition was made to the re-election of Messrs.\r\nBright, Dixon, and Muntz.\r\n\r\n1876, June 27.--Mr. Joseph Chamberlain was elected without opposition on\r\nthe resignation of Mr. Dixon.\r\n\r\n1880, March 31.--Though free from all the rioting and possible bloodshed\r\nthat would have attended such an occasion a hundred years ago, the\r\nelection of 1880 was the most exciting and hardest-fought battle between\r\nthe two great political parties of the town yet recorded in local\r\nhistory. The candidates were Messrs. John Bright, Joseph Chamberlain and\r\nPhilip Henry Muntz, the previous members and nominees of the Liberal\r\nAssociation, and Major Burnaby and the Hon. A.C.G. Calthorpe,\r\nConservatives. There were 139 polling stations, and no less than 47,776\r\nout of the 63,398 persons whose names were on the register, recorded\r\ntheir votes under the protection of the Ballot Act of 1870, now first\r\nbrought into use at a Parliamentary election. The usual courtesies (!)\r\nappertaining to political contests were indulged in to considerable\r\nextent, and personalities of all sorts much too freely bandied about,\r\nbut the election altogether passed off in the most creditable manner.\r\nThe returns of the polling stood thus--\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip Henry Muntz..... 22,803}\r\nJohn Bright............ 21,986}  Returned.\r\nJoseph Chamberlain..... 19,476}\r\nMajor Burnaby.......... 15,716\r\nHon. A.C.G. Calthorpe   14,270\r\n\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the polling issued by the Mayor about a week after the\r\nelection showed that 16,098 voters supported the Conservative candidates\r\nand 33,302 the Liberals. Deducting the 2,004 who \"split\" their votes\r\nbetween the parties, and 380 whose papers were either rejected or not\r\ncounted as being doubtful, the total gives 47,396 as the actual number\r\nwhose votes decided the election. As a curiosity and a puzzle for future\r\npoliticians, the Mayor's analysis is worth preserving, as here\r\nre-analysed:--\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUMPERS.\r\n\r\n  Calthorpe only      ..          ..          42\r\n  Burnaby only        ..          ..         164       206\r\n  Chamberlain only    ..          ..          50\r\n  Muntz only          ..          ..         199\r\n  Bright only         ..          ..          86       335\r\n\r\nSPLIT VOTES.\r\n\r\n  Calthorpe and Muntz             ..         153\r\n  Calthorpe and Chamberlain       ..          83\r\n  Burnaby and Muntz               ..       1,239\r\n  Burnaby and Chamberlain         ..         182\r\n  Bright and Calthorpe            ..         104\r\n  Bright and Burnaby              ..         243     2,004\r\n\r\nCON.

Three other local Liberal gentlemen were returned to\r\nParliament during this general election, viz.:--Mr. Jesse Collings for\r\nIpswich (receiving 3,074 votes), Mr. H. Wiggin for East Staffordshire\r\n(4,617 votes), and Mr. J.S. Wright for Nottingham (8,085 votes). The\r\nlast-named, however, did not live to take his seat, dying very suddenly\r\nwhile attending a committee-meeting at the Council House, Birmingham, on\r\nthe 15th April.--See \"_Statues_,\" &c According to the published returns\r\nof January, 1884, Birmingham was then the largest borough constituency\r\nin England, the number of electors on the register then in force being\r\n63,221: Liverpool coming next with 61,336; and Lambeth third, with\r\n55,588; but Glasgow was the largest in the United Kingdom, with 68,025.\r\nThe largest county constituency in England and Wales was Middlesex, with\r\n41,299 electors; the next being South-West Lancashire, with 30,624; the\r\nthird, South-East Lancashire, with 28,728; and the fourth, the southern\r\ndivision of the West Riding, with 27,625. The total electorate for\r\nEngland and Wales, was 2,660,444; Scotland, 331,264; and Ireland,\r\n230,156.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics have been taken from the returns named, showing\r\nin respect of each constituency in this neighbourhood, the area of each\r\nborough, city, or county division, the population, the number of\r\ninhabited houses, the number of voters and their qualifications, and the\r\nMembers sent to Parliament prior to the passing of the Franchise and\r\nRedistribution Bills of 1885, and are worth preserving for future local\r\nreference:--\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: this table has been split in order to fit the page\r\nwidth.]\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n|   Borough, City   | Area in |     Population    |Inhabited Houses |\r\n|     or County     | Square  |    in   |    in   |   in   |   in   |\r\n|     Division      | Miles.  |   1871  |   1881  |  1871  |  1881  |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n| Birmingham        |  13     | 343,787 | 400,774 | 68,532 | 78,301 |\r\n| Bewdley           |  11-1/4 |   7,614 |   8,678 |  1,717 |  1,839 |\r\n| Bridgnorth        |  17     |   7,317 |   7,212 |  1,565 |  1,52[**]\r\n| Coventry          |  10     |  41,348 |  46,563 |  9,334 | 10,185 |\r\n| Droitwich         |  43     |   9,510 |   9,858 |  1,931 |  2,006 |\r\n| Dudley            |  12     |  82,249 |  87,527 | 15,985 | 16,889 |\r\n| E.

The house was pulled down in 1826.\r\n\r\n~Parson and Clerk.~--A noted publichouse on the old Chester Road is the\r\nRoyal Oak, better known as \"The Parson and Clerk.\" An old pamphlet thus\r\ngives the why and wherefore:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"There had used to be on the top of the house two figures--one of a\r\n  parson leaning his head in prayer, while the clerk was behind him with\r\n  uplifted axe, going to chop off his head. These two figures were\r\n  placed there by John Gough, Esq., of Perry Hall, to commemorate a law\r\n  suit between him and the Rev. T. Lane, each having annoyed the other.\r\n  Mr. Lane had kept the Squire out of possession of this house, and had\r\n  withheld the licenses, while the latter had compelled the clergyman to\r\n  officiate daily in the church, by sending his servants to form a\r\n  congregation. Squire Gough won the day, re-built the house in 1788,\r\n  and put up the figures to annoy Parson Lane, parsons of all sorts\r\n  being out of his good books.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Parsons, Preachers, and Priests of the Past.~--It would be a lengthy\r\nlist or make note of all the worthy and reverend gentlemen who have,\r\nfrom pulpit or platform, lectured and preached to the people in our\r\ntown, or who have aided in the intellectual advancement and education of\r\nthe rising generation of their time. Church and Chapel alike have had\r\ntheir good men and true, and neither can claim a monopoly of talent, or\r\nboast much of their superiority in Christian fellowship or love of their\r\nkind. Many shepherds have been taken from their so-called flocks whose\r\nplaces at the time it was thought could never be filled, but whose very\r\nnames are now only to be found on their tombs, or mentioned in old\r\nmagazines or newspapers. Some few are here recalled as of interest from\r\ntheir position, peculiarities, &c.\r\n\r\n_John Angell James_.--A Wiltshire man was John Angell James, who, after\r\na short course of itinerary preaching came to Birmingham, and for more\r\nthan fifty years was the idolised minister of Carr's Lane congregation.\r\nHe was a good man and eloquent, having a certain attractive way which\r\nendeared him to many. He lived, and was loved by those who liked him,\r\ntill he had reached the age of 74, dying Oct. 1, 1859, his remains being\r\nburied like those of a saint, under the pulpit from which he had so long\r\npreached.\r\n\r\n_Samuel Bache_.--Coming as a Christmas-box to his parents in 1804, and\r\nearly trained for the pulpit, the Rev. Samuel Bache joined the Rev. John\r\nKentish in his ministrations to the Unitarian flock in 1832, and\r\nremained with us until 1868. Loved in his own community for faithfully\r\npreaching their peculiar doctrines, Mr. Bache proved himself a man of\r\nbroad and enlightened sympathies; one who could appreciate and support\r\nanything and everything that tended to elevate the people in their\r\namusements as well as in matters connected with education.\r\n\r\n_George Croft_.--The Lectureship of St. Martin's in the first year of\r\nthe present century was vested in Dr. George Croft, one of the good old\r\nsort of Church and King parsons, orthodox to the backbone, but from\r\nsundry peculiarities not particularly popular with the major portion of\r\nhis parishioners. He died in 1809.\r\n\r\n_George Dawson_.--Born in London, February 24, 1821, George Dawson\r\nstudied at Glasgow for the Baptist ministry, and came to this town in\r\n1844 to take the charge of Mount Zion chapel. The cribbed and crabbed\r\nrestraints of denominational church government failed, however, to\r\nsatisfy his independent heart, and in little more than two years his\r\nconnection with the Mount Zion congregation ceased (June 24, 1846). The\r\nChurch of the Saviour was soon after erected for him, and here he drew\r\ntogether worshippers of many shades of religious belief, and ministered\r\nunto them till his death. As a lecturer he was known everywhere, and\r\nthere are but few towns in the kingdom that he did not visit, while his\r\ntour in America, in the Autumn of 1874, was a great success. His\r\nconnection with the public institutions of this town is part of our\r\nmodern history, and no man yet ever exercised such influence or did more\r\nto advance the intelligence and culture of the people, and, as John\r\nBright once said of Cobden \"it was not until we had lost him that we\r\nknew how much we loved him.\" The sincerity and honesty of purpose right\r\nthrough his life, and exhibited in all his actions, won the highest\r\nesteem of even those who differed from him, and the announcement of his\r\nsudden death (Nov. 30, 1876) was felt as a blow by men of all creeds or\r\npolitics who had ever known him or heard him. To him the world owes the\r\nformation of the first Shakesperian Library--to have witnessed its\r\ndestruction would indeed have been bitter agony to the man who (in\r\nOctober, 1866) had been chosen to deliver the inaugural address at the\r\nopening of the Free Reference Library, to which he, with friends, made\r\nsuch an addition. As a preacher, he was gifted with remarkable powers;\r\nas a lecturer, he was unsurpassed; in social matters, he was the friend\r\nof all, with ever-open hand to those in need; as a politician, though\r\nkeen at repartee and a hard hitter, he was straightforward, and no\r\ntime-server; and in the word of his favourite author, \"Take him all in\r\nall, we ne'er shall look on his like again.\"--See \"_Statues_,\" &c.\r\n\r\n_W. D. Long_.--The Rev. Wm Duncan Long (who died at Godalming, April 12,\r\n1878), according to the _Record_, was \"a good man, and full of the Holy\r\nGhost and of faith.\" In our local records he is noted as being\r\ndistinguished for hard work among the poor of St. Bartholomew's, of\r\nwhich parish he was minister for many years prior to 1851.\r\n\r\n_Thomas Swann_.--The Rev. Thomas Swann, who came here in January 1829,\r\nafter a few years' sojourn in India, served the Cannon Street body for\r\n28 years, during which time he baptised 966 persons, admitting into\r\nmembership a total of 1,233. Mr. Swann had an attack of apoplexy, while\r\nin Glasgow, on Sunday, March 7, 1857, and died two days afterwards. His\r\nremains were brought to Birmingham, and were followed to the grave\r\n(March 16) by a large concourse of persons, a number of ministers taking\r\npart in the funeral service.\r\n\r\n_W. L. Giles_.--The Rev. W. Leese Giles, who filled the pulpit in Cannon\r\nStreet from Oct., 1863, to July, 1872, was peculiarly successful in his\r\nministrations, especially among the young.\r\n\r\n_Lewis Chapman_.--The Rev. Lewis Chapman (taken to his fathers Oct. 2,\r\n1877, at the age of 81), after performing the duties and functions of\r\nRabbi to the local Jewish community for more than forty-five years, was,\r\nfrom his amiability and benevolence, characterised by many Gentile\r\nfriends as \"an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.\"\r\n\r\n_Hon. G. M. Yorke_.--Brother to the late Earl of Hardwicke, and born in\r\n1809, Mr. Yorke, on finishing his University education, entered the\r\narmy, obtaining a commission in the Fourth Dragoons; and, considering\r\nhis subsequent connection with Birmingham in a widely different\r\ncharacter, it is curious that his first visit here should have been paid\r\nas an officer of dragoons in the Chartist riots of 1839. Mr. Yorke's\r\npersonal tastes, however, led him to prefer the Church to the army, and\r\nhe entered into holy orders, the Bishop of Worcester, in 1814,\r\npresenting him to the rectory of St. Philip's: and at a later period he\r\nwas nominated Rural Dean. Mr. Yorke held the living of St. Philip's for\r\nthe long period of thirty years--until 1874--when the Prime Minister\r\nappointed him Dean of Worcester. During his residence in Birmingham Mr.\r\nYorke did much public service in connection with various educational\r\ninstitutions. He promoted good schools in St. Philip's parish, and was\r\nan active member of the committee of the Educational Prize Scheme, and\r\nthen of the Education Aid Society, both of them institutions which were\r\nof great value in their day. He also took a strong interest in the\r\naffairs of Queen's College, of which he was for many years the\r\nVice-president. In the Diocesan Training College, at Saldey, he likewise\r\ntook part as a member of the managing body and he was interested in the\r\nSchool of Art and the Midland Institute. Wherever, indeed, there was\r\neducational work to be done, the Rector of St. Philip's was sure to be\r\nfound helping in it; and though there have been many Rectors at the\r\nchurch it can be truly said that none left more regretted by the poor,\r\nnotwithstanding the aristocratic handle to his name, than did Mr. Yorke.\r\nThe Hon. and Rev. gentleman died at Worcester, Oct. 2, 1879.\r\n\r\n_J.C. Miller_.--The Rev. John Cale Miller (born at Margate, in 1814),\r\nthough only thirty-two, hail already attracted the notice of the\r\nEvangelical Party in the Church, and his appointment to St. Martin's\r\n(Sept. 1846), gave general satisfaction. His reputation as a preacher\r\nhad preceded him, and he soon diffused a knowledge of his vigour as a\r\nworker, and his capacity as an administrator. Few men have entered so\r\nquickly into popular favour as Dr. Miller did, which may, perhaps, be\r\naccounted for by the fact that he not only showed a sincere desire to\r\nlive in harmony with the Dissenters of all shades, but that he was\r\nprepared to take his full share in the public work of the town, and\r\ndetermined to be the minister--not of any section of the people, but of\r\nthe parish altogether. Under his direction St. Martin's became a model\r\nparish. New facilities were afforded for public worship, schools were\r\nestablished, parochial institutions multiplied under his hand, an ample\r\nstaff of curates and scripture-readers took their share of labour, and\r\nthe energies of the lay members of the congregation were called into\r\nactive exercise. To the Grammar School, the Midland Institute, the Free\r\nLibraries, the Hospitals and Charities of the town, the Volunteer\r\nmovement, &c., he gave most assiduous attention, and as long as he\r\nremained with us, his interest in all public matters never failed. In\r\nthe early part of 1866, Dr. Miller was presented to the living at\r\nGreenwich, taking his farewell of the townspeople of Birmingham at a\r\nmeeting in the Town Hall, April 21, when substantial proof of the public\r\ngoodwill towards him was given by a crowded audience of all creeds and\r\nall classes. A handsome service of plate and a purse of 600 guineas,\r\nwere presented to him, along with addresses from the congregation of St.\r\nMartin's, the Charity Collections Committee, the Rifle Volunteers (to\r\nwhom he had been Chaplain), the Committees of the Hospitals, and from\r\nthe town at large. The farewell sermon to St. Martin's congregation was\r\npreached April 29. In 1871 Dr. Miller was appointed residential Canon of\r\nWorcester, which preferment he soon afterwards exchanged for a Canonry\r\nat Rochester as being nearer to his home, other honours also falling to\r\nhim before his death, which took place on the night of Sunday, July 11,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\n_George Peake_.--The Rev. G. Peake, Vicar of Aston, from 1852 to his\r\ndeath, July 9, 1876, was a ripe scholar and archæologist, a kind-hearted\r\npastor, and an effective preacher.\r\n\r\n_Isaiah Birt_.--Mr. Isaiah Birt, a native of Coleford, undertook the\r\npastorship of Cannon Street in 1800, holding it until Christmas, 1825,\r\nwhen from ill-health he resigned. The congregation allowed Mr. Birt an\r\nannuity of £100 until his death, in 1837, when he had reached 80 years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n_Thomas Potts_.--The Rev. Thomas Potts, who died in the early part of\r\nDecember, 1819, at the age of sixty-and-six, was, according to the\r\nprinted funeral oration pronounced at the time, \"an accurate, profound,\r\nand cautious theologian,\" who had conducted the classical studies at\r\nOscott College for five-and-twenty years with vigour and enthusiasm, and\r\n\"a grandeur of ability peculiarly his own.\"\r\n\r\n_Sacheveral_.--Dr. Sacheveral, the noted and noisy worthy who kicked up\r\nsuch a rumpus in the days of Queen Anne, was a native of Sutton\r\nColdfield, and his passing through Birmingham in 1709 was considered\r\nsuch an event of consequence that the names of the fellows who cheered\r\nhim in the streets were reported to Government.\r\n\r\n_Pearce_.--Ordained pastor of Cannon Street, Aug. 18, 1790. Mr. Pearce,\r\nin the course of a short life, made himself one of the most prominent\r\nBaptist divines of the day, the church under his charge increasing so\r\nrapidly that it became the source of great uneasiness to the deacons.\r\nMr. Pearce took great interest in the missionary cause, preaching here\r\nthe first sermon on behalf of the Baptist Missionary Society (Oct.,\r\n1792), on which occasion £70 was handed in; he also volunteered to go to\r\nIndia himself. Suffering from consumption he preached his last sermon\r\nDec. 2, 1798, lingering on till the 10th of October following, and dying\r\nat the early age of 33. He was buried at the foot of the pulpit stairs.\r\n\r\n_Slater_.--Hutton says that an apothecary named Slater made himself\r\nRector of St. Martin's during the days of the Commonwealth, and that\r\nwhen the authorities came to turn him out he hid himself in a dark\r\ncorner. This is the individual named in Houghton's \"History of Religion\r\nin England\" as being brought before the Court of Arches charged with\r\nhaving forged his letters of orders, with preaching among the Quakers,\r\nrailing in the pulpit at the parishioners, swearing, gambling, and other\r\nmore scandalous offences.\r\n\r\n_Scholefield_.--The pastor of the Old Meeting Congregation in 1787 was\r\nnamed Scholefield, and he was the first to properly organise Sunday\r\nSchools in connection with Dissenting places of worship.\r\n\r\n_Robert Taylor_.--The horrible title of \"The Devil's Chaplain\" was given\r\nthe Rev. Robert Taylor, B.A., who in 1819-20 was for short periods\r\ncurate at Yardley and at St. Paul's in this town. He had been educated\r\nfor the Church, and matriculated well, but adopted such Deistical\r\nopinions that he was ultimately expelled the Church, and more than once\r\nafter leaving here was imprisoned for blasphemy.\r\n\r\n_Charles Vince_.--Charles Vince was the son of a carpenter, and was a\r\nnative of Surrey, being born at Farnham in 1823. For some years after\r\nreaching manhood Mr. Vince was a Chartist lecturer, but was chosen\r\nminister of Mount Zion Chapel in 1851, and remained with us till Oct.\r\n22, 1874, when he was removed to the world above. His death was a loss\r\nto the whole community, among whom he had none but friends.\r\n\r\n_John Webb_.--The Rev. John Webb, who about 1802 was appointed Lecturer\r\nat St. Martin's and Minister of St. Bartholomew's was an antiquarian\r\nscholar of some celebrity; but was specially valued here (though his\r\nstay was not long) on account of his friendship with Mendelssohn and\r\nNeukomm, and for the valued services he rendered at several Festivals.\r\nHe wrote the English adaptation of Winter's \"Timoteo,\" or \"Triumph of\r\nGideon,\" performed at the Festival of 1823, and other effective pieces\r\nbefore and after that date, interesting himself in the success of the\r\nTriennials for many years. He died February 18, 1869, in Herefordshire.\r\n\r\n_William Wollaston_.--That eminent English divine, the Rev. William\r\nWollaston, who was born in the neighbouring county of Stafford, in 1659,\r\nwas for several years assistant, and afterwards head master at our Free\r\nGrammar School, but, coming into a rich inheritance, retired. He died in\r\n1724.\r\n\r\nAnd so the list might go on, with such names as the Rev. Charles Curtis,\r\nof St. Martin's (1784) the Rev. E. Burn, of St. Mary's (1818), the Rev.\r\nJohn Cook, of St. Bartholomew's (1820), the Rev. W.F. Hook, of Moseley\r\n(1822), afterwards Dean of Christchurch; Dr. Outram, of St. Philip's\r\n(who died in 1821); Rann Kennedy, of St. Paul's; G.S. Bull, of St.\r\nThomas's; with I. C. Barratt, of St Mary's, and many other clergymen and\r\nministers, who have departed in these later years.\r\n\r\n~Patents.~--The first patent granted to a Birmingham inventor is dated\r\nMay 22, 1722, it being granted to Richard Baddeley for having \"with much\r\npains, labour, and expense, invented and brought to perfection 'An Art\r\nfor making streaks for binding Cart and Wagon Wheels and Box Smoothing\r\nIrons' (never yet practised in this our kingdom) which will be more\r\ndurable and do three times the service of those made of bar iron,\" &c.,\r\n&c. It is not particularly wonderful that the toyshop of England should\r\nstand first on the list as regards the number of patent grants applied\r\nfor and taken out. As Bisset said--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inventions curious, various kinds of toys,\r\n  Engage the time of women, men, and boys;\r\n  And Royal patents here are found in scores,\r\n  For articles Minute--or pond'rous ores.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1799 the list shows that 92 patents had been granted to\r\nBirmingham men after Richard Baddeley had brought out his \"patent\r\nstreaks,\" and during the present century there have been many hundreds\r\nof designs patented or registered, scores of fortunes being made and\r\nthousands of hands employed, but often the inventors themselves have\r\nsold their rights for trifling amounts or succumbed to the difficulties\r\nthat stood in the way of bringing their brainwork into practical use.\r\nCould the records of our County Asylums be thoroughly inspected, it is\r\nto be feared that disappointed inventors would be found more numerous\r\nthan any other class of inmates. The costs of taking out, renewing, and\r\nprotecting patents were formerly so enormous as practically to prevent\r\nany great improvements where capital was short, and scores of our local\r\nworkers emigrated to America and elsewhere for a clearer field wherein\r\nto exercise their inventive faculties without being so weighted down by\r\npatent laws. The Patent Law Amendment Act of 1852 was hailed with\r\nrejoicing, but even the requirements of that Act were found much too\r\nheavy. The Act which came into force Jan. 1, 1884, promises to remedy\r\nmany of the evils hitherto existing. By this Act, the fees payable on\r\npatents are as follows:--On application for provisional specification,\r\n£1; on filing complete specification, £3; _or_, on filing complete\r\nspecification with the first application, £4. These are all the fees up\r\nto the date of granting a patent. After granting, the following fees are\r\npayable: Before four years from date of patent, £50; and before the end\r\nof eight years from the date of patent, £100. In lieu of the £50 and the\r\n£100 payments, the following annual fees may be paid: Before the end of\r\nthe fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh years. £10 each year; before the\r\nend of the eighth and ninth years, £15 each year; and before the end of\r\nthe tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth years, £20 each year.--If\r\nthe number of words contained in the specifications constitutes the\r\nvalue of a patent, that taken out by our townsman, James Hardy (March\r\n28, 1844), for an improvement in tube-rolling must have been one of the\r\nmost valuable ever known. The specifications filled 176 folios, in\r\naddition to a large sheet of drawings, the cost of an \"office copy\"\r\nbeing no less than £12 18s! The _Mechanics' Magazine_ said it could\r\nhave all been described in 176 words.\r\n\r\n~Patriotic Fund.~--The local collection for this fund was commenced\r\nOctober, 25, 1854, and closed February 22, 1858, with a total of £12,936\r\n17s. 3d.\r\n\r\n~Paving.~--A \"patent\" was obtained in 1319, 12th Edw. II., to \"take toll\r\non all vendible commodities for three years, to pave the town of\r\nBirmingham;\" and as the funds thus raised were not sufficient for such a\r\n\"town improvement,\" another \"patent\" for the purpose was procured in\r\n1333, 7th Edw. III., the toll being fixed at one farthing on every eight\r\nbushels of corn. What the paving was in the early part of the present\r\ncentury is best told in the following extract from Bissett's\r\n\"Magnificent Directory,\" published in 1800:--\r\n\r\n  The streets are pav'd, 'tis true, but all the stones\r\n  Are set the wrong end up, in shape of cones;\r\n  And strangers limp along the best pav'd street,\r\n  As if parch'd peas were strew'd beneath their feet,\r\n  Whilst custom makes the Natives scarcely feel\r\n  Sharp-pointed pebbles press the toe or heel.\r\n\r\nAbout 1819-20 the roadways were stoned with the aid of a steam\r\npaving-engine, supplied with a row of six heavy rammers, which dropped\r\non the uneven stones and drove them into the roads, the engine moving\r\nabout a foot after each series of blows. A wood roadway was laid in Moor\r\nStreet in April, 1873; and in June, 1874, the Council decided also so to\r\npave New Street, High Street, and Bull Street. At their meeting, June\r\n1876, it was resolved to spend £30,000 a year for six years in paving\r\nstreets, and they have done all _that_.\r\n\r\n~Pawnbrokers.~--In December, 1789, a Bill was prepared for presentation\r\nto Parliament \"to suppress all pawnbrokers within the town.\" and to\r\nestablish in lieu a general office for pledges. Wonder what our uncles\r\nthought of it.\r\n\r\n~Peace.~--A branch of the Workmen's Peace Association was formed\r\nDecember 18, 1871.\r\n\r\n~Pebble Mill Pool.~--The last few years a favourite spot for suicides,\r\nno less than thirty-nine persons having drowned themselves there since\r\n1875. Strangely enough there was not a single similar case in the four\r\nyears preceding, and only three cases of accidental drownings in the\r\nlast 27 years.\r\n\r\n~Peck Lane.~--Originally called Feck Lane, leading out of New Street,\r\nnext to the Grammar School, was closed and cleared for the Railway\r\nStation. Steep and narrow as the old thoroughfare was, it was at one\r\ntime thought quite as much of as Bull Street.\r\n\r\n~Pearls and Pearl Fisheries.~--A few small pearls are occasionally found\r\nenclosed in the nacre (or mother-of-pearl) of shells cut up for buttons,\r\n&c., but seldom of much value, though it is related that a few years\r\nback a pearl thus discovered by a workman, and handed over to his\r\nemployer, was sold for £40, realising £150 afterwards. In March, 1884,\r\nMr. James Webb, Porchester Street, had the good fortune to find a pearl\r\nweighing 31 grains in an Australian shell he was cutting up, and it has\r\nbeen valued at £100. As there is a good market here for pearls, no doubt\r\nmany others have been found that \"have not come to light.\" A few years\r\nback, \"pearl fisheries\" of rather an extraordinary kind were here and\r\nthere to be found in the outskirts, the prices of good workable shell\r\nhaving risen to to such an extent that it paid to hunt for and dig up\r\nthe scrap flung away in former years, as much as 15s. to 20s. per bag\r\nbeing obtained for some of these finds. One smart little master who\r\nrecollected where his scrap was deposited some years before, in the\r\nneighbourhood of St. Luke's, paid the spot a visit, and finding it still\r\nunbuilt upon, set to work, and carted most of it back, and having\r\nimproved tools, made a handsome profit by this resurrection movement.--\r\nSee \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~Pens.~--The question as to who made the first steel pen has often been\r\ndebated; but though Perry and Mason, Mitchell and Gillott, and others\r\nbesides, have been named as the real original, it is evident that\r\nsomeone had come before them; for, in a letter written at least 200\r\nyears back (lately published by the Camden Society), the writer, Mary\r\nHatton, offered to procure some pens made of steel for her brother, as\r\n\"neither the glass pens nor any other sort was near so good.\" Silver\r\npens were advertised for sale in the _Morning Chronicle_, in June, 1788,\r\nas well as \"fountain pens;\" and it has been claimed that an American\r\nsupplied his friends with metallic pens a dozen years prior to that\r\ndate. There was a Sheffield artisan, too, before our local men came to\r\nthe front, who made some pens on the principle of the quill, a long\r\nhollow barrel, pointed and split; but they were considered more in the\r\nlight of curiosities than for use, and fetched prices accordingly. Mr.\r\nJames Perry is said to have given his workmen 5s. each for making pens,\r\nas late as 1824; and Mr. Gillott got 1s. each for a gross he made on the\r\nmorning of his marriage. In 1835, the lowest wholesale price was 5s. per\r\ngross; now they can be had at a trifle over 1d. per gross. Even after\r\nthe introduction of presses for the manufacture of steel pens (in 1829),\r\nthere was considerable quantities of little machines made here for\r\ncutting quill pens, the \"grey goose quill\" being in the market for\r\nschool use as late as 1855, and many bankers and others have not yet\r\ndiscarded them. In May, 1853, a quantity of machinery was sent out to\r\nAmerica, where many skilled workmen had gone previously; and now our\r\nYankee cousins not only make their own pens, and run us close in all\r\nforeign markets, but actually send their productions to Birmingham\r\nitself.--See \"_Trades_.\"\r\n\r\n~People's Hall.~--The foundation stone of the People's Hall, corner of\r\nLoveday and Princip Streets, was laid on Easter Monday, 1841, by General\r\n(then Colonel) Perronet Thompson. The cost of the building was £2,400,\r\nand, as its name implies, it was intended, and for a short time used, as\r\na place for assemblies, balls, and other public purposes. Like a number\r\nof other \"institutions for the people,\" it came to grief, and has long\r\nbeen nothing more than a warehouse.\r\n\r\n~Pershore Road~ was laid out in 1825.\r\n\r\n~Perry Barr.~--Three miles from Birmingham, on the road to Lichfield, is\r\none of the ancient places that can claim a note in Domesday. Prior to\r\nthe eighteenth century there had been a wooden bridge over the Tame, the\r\npresent curiously-built stone erection, with its recesses to protect the\r\nwayfarers from contact with crossing vehicles, being put up in 1711-12\r\nby Sir Henry Gough, who received £200 from the county, and contributions\r\nfrom the neighbouring parishes, towards the cost. The date of the early\r\nchurch is unknown, the present one being built and endowed by Squire\r\nGough in 1832. Like other suburbs Perry Barr bids fair to become little\r\nmore than an offshoot to Birmingham, the road thereto fast filling up\r\nwith villa and other residences, while churches, chapels, and schools\r\nmay be seen on all hands. The Literary Institute, built in 1874, at a\r\ncost of £2,000, contains reading and class rooms, lecture hall, &c.,\r\nwhile not far off is a station on the L. and N.W. line. Ferry Hall, the\r\nseat of the Hon. A.C.G. Calthorpe, has been the home of the Lords of the\r\nManor for many generations.\r\n\r\n~Pest and Plague.~--The year 1665 is generally given as the date of \"the\r\ngreat plague\" being here; but the register of St. Martin's Church does\r\nnot record any extraordinary mortality in that year. In some of the\r\n\"news sheets\" of the 17th century a note has been met with (dated Sept.\r\n28, 1631), in which the Justices of the Peace inform the Sheriff that\r\n\"the plague had broken out in Deritend, in the parish of Aston, and\r\nspread far more dangerously into Birmingham, a great market town.\" St.\r\nMartin's registers of burials are missing from 1631 to 1655, and those\r\nof Aston are not get-at-able, and as the latter would record the deaths\r\nin Deritend, there does not appear any certain data to go upon, except\r\nthat the plague was not a casual visitor, having visited Coventry in\r\n1603 and 1625, Tamworth in 1606 and 1625, and Worcester in 1825 and\r\n1645, the date generally given (1665) being that of the year when the\r\nmost deaths 68,596, occurred in London. The tradition is that the plague\r\ncontagion was brought here in a box of clothes conveyed by a carrier\r\nfrom London. It is said that so many persons died in this town that the\r\nchurchyard would not hold the bodies, and the dead were taken to a\r\none-acre piece of waste land at Ladywood Green, hence known for many\r\ngenerations as the \"Pest Ground.\" The site has long been built over, but\r\nno traces of any kind of sepulture were found when house foundations\r\nwere being laid.\r\n\r\n~Pewter.~--To have bright pewter plates and dishes ranged on their\r\nkitchen shelves was once the delight and the pride of all well-to-do\r\nhousewives, and even the tables of royalty did not disdain the pewter.\r\nAt the grand dinner on George IV.'s Coronation-day, though gold and\r\nsilver plate was there in abundance for the most noble of the noble\r\nguests, the majority were served on brightly-burnished pewter, supplied\r\nfrom Thomason's of Birmingham. The metal is seldom seen now except in\r\nthe shape of cups and measures used by publicans.\r\n\r\n~Philanthropic Collections.~--The following are a few not mentioned in\r\nprevious pages:--A local fund for the relief of sufferers by famine in\r\nAsia Minor was opened May 6, 1875, the amount collected being £682.--In\r\n1875, a little over £1,700 was gathered to aid the sufferers from the\r\ninundations in France that year.--November 25, 1878, at a meeting held\r\nto sympathise with the losers through the failure of the Glasgow Bank\r\nmore than £1,000 was subscribed; £750 being gathered afterwards.--The\r\nMayor's Relief Fund, in the winter-time of 1878-79, totalled up to\r\n£10,242, of which £9,500 was expended in relief, £537 in expenses, and\r\nthe balance divided between the Hospitals. The number of separate gifts\r\nor donations to the poor was 500,187, equivalent to relieving once\r\n108,630 families.\r\n\r\n~Philanthropic Societies.~--Are as numerous as they are various, and the\r\namount of money, and money's worth, distributed each year is something\r\nsurprising. The following are the principal ones:--\r\n\r\n_Aged Women_.--A society was commenced here in 1824 for the relief of\r\npoor women over 60 years of age, and there are now on the books the\r\nnames of nearly 200 who receive, during the year, in small amounts, an\r\naverage of 17s to 18s. each. Miss Southall, 73, Wellington Road, is one\r\nof the Hon. Sees., who will be pleased to receive additional\r\nsubscriptions. Fifty other aged women are yearly benefitted through\r\nFentham's Trust.--See \"_Blue Coat School_.\"\r\n\r\n_Architects_.--There is a Benevolent Society in connection with the\r\nRoyal Institute of British Architects, for relieving poor members of the\r\nprofession, their widows, or orphans. The local representative is Mr. F.\r\nCross, 14A, Temple Row.\r\n\r\n_Aunt Judy's Work Society_.--On the plan of one started in London a few\r\nyears back; the object being to provide clothes for poor children in the\r\nHospitals. The secretary is Mrs. W. Lord, Brakendale, Farquhar Road,\r\nEdgbaston.\r\n\r\n_Bibles, etc_.--The Birmingham Depository of the British and Foreign\r\nBible Society is at 40, Paradise Street; and that of the Christian\r\nKnowledge Society is at 92, New Street.\r\n\r\n_Boarding-out Poor Children_.--A Ladies' Society for Befriending Pauper\r\nChildren by taking them from the Workhouse and boarding them out among\r\ncottagers and others in the country, had been quietly at work for some\r\ndozen years before the Marston Green Homes were built, but whether the\r\nlatter rule-of-thumb experiment will prove more successful than that of\r\nthe ladies, though far more costly, the coming generation must decide.\r\n\r\n_Boatmen's Friend Society_.--A branch of the British Seamen's and\r\nBoatmen's Friend Society, principally for the supply of religious\r\neducation to the boatmen and their families on the canals, the\r\ndistribution among them of healthy literature, and the support of the\r\nwork carried on at the Boatmen's Hall, Worcester Wharf, where the\r\nSuperintendent (Rev. R.W. Cusworth) may be found. The subscriptions in\r\n1882 amounted to £416.\r\n\r\n_Church Pastoral Aid Society_.--The name tells what subscriptions are\r\nrequired for, and the Rev. J.G. Dixon, Rector of St. George's, will be\r\nglad to receive them. The grants of the Parent Society to Birmingham in\r\n1882 amounted to £3,560, while the local subscriptions were only £1,520.\r\n\r\n_Clergymen's Widows_.--The Society for Necessitous Clergy within the\r\nArchdeaconry of Coventry, whose office is at 10, Cherry Street, has an\r\nincome from subscriptions, &c., of about £320 per year, which is mainly\r\ndevoted to grants to widows and orphans of clergymen, with occasional\r\ndonations to disabled wearers of the cloth.\r\n\r\n_Deritend Visiting and Parochial Society_, established in 1856. Meeting\r\nat the Mission Hall, Heathmill Lane, where Sunday Schools, Bible\r\nclasses, Mothers' Meetings, &c., are conducted. The income for 1883 was\r\n£185 7s. 4d., and the expenditure £216 16s. 7d., leaving a balance to be\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n_District Nursing Society_, 56, Newhall Street, has for its object the\r\nnursing of sick poor at their own homes in cases of necessity. In 1883\r\nthe number of cases attended by the Society's nurses was 312, requiring\r\n8,344 visits.\r\n\r\n_Domestic Missions_, of one kind and another, are connected with all the\r\nprincipal places of worship, and it would be a difficult task to\r\nenumerate them. One of the earliest is the Hurst Street Unitarian,\r\ndating from 1839.\r\n\r\n_Flower Mission_.--At No. 3, Great Charles Street, ladies attend every\r\nFriday to receive donation of flowers, &c., for distribution in the\r\nwards of the Hospitals, suitable texts and passages of Scripture\r\naccompanying the gifts to the patients.\r\n\r\n_Girls' Friendly Society_.--The local Branch, of which there are several\r\nsub (or parochial) branches, has on its books near upon 1,400 names of\r\nyoung women in service, &c., whose welfare and interests are looked\r\nafter by a number of clergymen and ladies in connection with the Church\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n_Humane Society_.--A Branch on the plan of the London Society was\r\nestablished here in 1790, but it was found best to incorporate it with\r\nthe General Hospital in 1803.\r\n\r\n_India_.--A Branch of the Christian Vernacular Education Society for\r\nIndia was formed here in 1874. There are several branches in this town\r\nand neighbourhood of the Indian Female Normal School and Instruction\r\nSociety for making known the Gospel to the women of India, and about\r\n£600 per year is gathered here.\r\n\r\n_Iron, Hardware, and Metal Trades' Pension Society_ was commenced in\r\nthis town in 1842. Its head offices are now in London; the local\r\ncollector being Mr. A. Forrest, 32, Union Street.\r\n\r\n_Jews and Gentiles_.--There are local Auxiliary Branches here of the\r\nAnglo-Jewish Association, the Society for Promoting Christianity among\r\nthe Jews, and the British Society for Propagating the Gospel among Jews,\r\nthe amounts subscribed to each in 1882 being £72, £223, and £29\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n_Kindness to Animals_.--Mainly by the influence and efforts of Miss\r\nJulia Goddard, in 1875, a plan was started of giving prizes among the\r\nscholars and pupil teachers of the Board Schools for the best written\r\npapers tending to promote kindness to animals. As many as 3,000 pupils\r\nand 60 teachers send papers in every year, and the distribution of 500\r\nprizes is annually looked forward to with interest. Among the prizes are\r\nseveral silver medals--one (the champion) being given in memory of Mr.\r\nCharles Darwin, another in memory of Mr. E.F. Flower, a third (given by\r\nMr. J.H. Chamberlain) in memory of Mr. George Dawson, and a fourth given\r\nby the Mayor.\r\n\r\n_Ladies' Useful Work Association_.--Established in 1877 for the\r\ninculcating habits of thrift and the improvement of domestic life among\r\nmothers of families and young people commencing married life. A start\r\nwas made (Oct. 4) in the shape of a series of \"Cookery Lessons,\" which\r\nwere exceedingly well attended. Series of useful lectures and lessons\r\nhave followed since, all bearing on home life, and as it has been shown\r\nthat nearly one-half of the annual number of deaths in Birmingham are\r\nthose of children under 5 years of age, it is to be hoped that the\r\n\"useful work\" the ladies of the Association have undertaken may be\r\nresultive in at least decreasing such infantile mortality. Office, No.\r\n1, Broad Street Corner. In March, 1883, the ladies had a balance in hand\r\nof £88.\r\n\r\n_Needlework Guild_,--Another Ladies' Association of a similar character\r\nto the above was established April 30, 1883.\r\n\r\n_Negroes' Friends_.--When slavery was as much a British as American\r\ninstitution it was not surprising that a number of lady residents should\r\nform themselves, in 1825, into a Negroes' Friend Society. The funds now\r\ncollected, nearly £170 a year, are given in grants to schools on the\r\nWest Coast of Africa and the West Indies, and in donations to the\r\nFreedmen's Aid Society, the Anti-Slavery Society, &c.\r\n\r\n_Old Folks' Tea Party_.--In 1857, a few old people were given a treat\r\njust prior to Christmas, and the good folks who got it up determined to\r\nrepeat it. The next gatherings were assembled at the Priory Rooms, but\r\nin a few years it became needful to engage the Town Hall, and there\r\nthese treats, which are given biennially, are periodically held. At the\r\nlast gathering there attended over 700, not one of whom was under sixty\r\nyears of age, while some were long past their three-score and ten, and a\r\nfew bordered on ninety. The funds are raised by the sale of tickets (to\r\nbe given by the purchasers to such old people they think deserve it),\r\nand by subscriptions, the recipients of the treat not only having that\r\nenjoyment, but also take home with them warm clothing and other usefuls\r\nsuited to their time of life.\r\n\r\n_Prevention of Cruelty to Animals_.--Birmingham Society for this purpose\r\nwas established in 1852, and its officers have frequently been the means\r\nof punishing inhuman brutes who cruelly treated the animals entrusted to\r\ntheir care. Cases of this kind should be reported to Mr. B. Scott, the\r\nSociety's Secretary, 31, Bennett's Hill. In 1882, 125 persons were\r\nsummoned, and 107 of them convicted, the year's expenditure being £344.\r\n\r\n_Religious Tract Society_.--A local auxiliary was established here in\r\n1853 in which year £409 were realised, by the sale of books, tracts, and\r\nreligious periodicals; in 1863 that amount was quadrupled; in 1873 the\r\nreceipts were nearly £2,000. Last year (1883) the value of the sales\r\nreached £2,597, and, in addition, there had been free grants made of\r\nmore than 13,000 tracts and magazines--the Hospitals, Lunatic Asylums,\r\nWorkhouses, Police Stations, Cabmen's Rests, &c., being supplied\r\ngratuitously.\r\n\r\n_St. John Ambulance Association_.--The Birmingham Branch of this\r\nAssociation was organised in 1881, and some hundreds of both sexes have\r\nsince then passed the examination, and obtained certificates of their\r\nproficiency in ambulance work, and in the treatment of ordinary cases of\r\naccident or sudden illness. It would be a good thing if every man and\r\nwoman in the town had similar knowledge, and would make use of it when\r\noccasions require quick thought and ready hand. The secretary is Mr.\r\nJ.K. Patten, 105, Colmore Row.\r\n\r\n_St. Thomas's Day Charity_.--A very old custom in Edgbaston has been the\r\ncollection of donations for a Christmas distribution to the poor and old\r\nof the parish. Regular accounts have been booked for over fifty years,\r\nbut how much longer the custom has existed is uncertain. At first, money\r\nonly was given, afterwards part was given in bread and packets of tea,\r\nwhile of later years a stock of about 500 blankets has been provided for\r\nlending out. The receipts per year are about £200.\r\n\r\n_True Blues_.--In 1805 a number of young men who had been brought up at\r\nthe Blue Coat School and who called themselves the \"Grateful Society,\"\r\nunited their contributions and presented that charity with £52 10s. 3d.\r\nin gratitude for the benefits they had received, a worthy plan which was\r\nfollowed for several years. These same young men originated the \"United\r\nSociety of True Blues\" (composed of members who had been reared in the\r\nSchool) for the purpose of forming a fund for the relief of such of\r\ntheir number as might be in distress, and further to raise periodical\r\nsubscriptions for their old school, part of which is yearly expended in\r\nprizes among the children.\r\n\r\n~Philanthropic and Benevolent Institutions~--Birmingham cannot be said\r\never to have wanted for charitable citizens, as the following list of\r\nphilanthropic institutions, societies, and trusts will show:--\r\n\r\n_Blind Institution_, Carpenter Road, Edgbaston.--The first establishment\r\nin this town for teaching the blind was opened at 113, Broad Street, in\r\nMarch, 1847, with five boarders and twelve day pupils. At Midsummer, in\r\nthe following year, Islington House was taken, with accommodation for\r\nthirteen resident and twelve day scholars, but so well did the public\r\nmeet the wishes of the patrons and committee of the Institution, that\r\nthe latter were soon in a position to take upon lease a site for a\r\npermanent building (two acres, at £40 a year for 99 years), and on the\r\n23rd of April, 1851, the corner-stone was laid of the present handsome\r\nestablishment near to Church Road, the total cost of completion being\r\nabout £7,000. Nearly another £7,000 has since been expended in the\r\nerection of workrooms, master's residence, in furniture, musical\r\ninstruments, tools, &c., and the Institution may be considered in as\r\nflourishing a condition as any in the town. The 37th annual report (to\r\nLady-day, 1884), stated that the number of in-door pupils during the\r\npast year had been 86--viz., 51 males and 35 females. In the same period\r\n4 paid teachers, 15 out-door blind teachers and workmen, and 4 females\r\nhad been employed. The number of adult blind residing at their own\r\nhomes, and visited by the blind teachers engaged in this department of\r\nthe work was 253. The total number of persons benefited by the\r\ninstitution was therefore 362. The financial statement showed that the\r\nexpenditure had been £6,067 2s. 7d., of which £1,800 had been invested\r\nin Birmingham Corporation Stock. The receipts amounted to £6,403 7s.\r\n9d., leaving a balance of £336 5s. 2d. in the treasurer's hands. The\r\nstatement of receipts and payments on behalf of the adult blind\r\nhome-teaching branch, which are kept separately, showed a balance due to\r\nthe treasurer of £71 5s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Bloomsbury Institution_.--Commencing in 1860 with a small school, Mr.\r\nDavid Smith has gradually founded at Bloomsbury an institution which\r\ncombines educational, evangelistic, and missionary agencies of great\r\nvalue to the locality. The premises include a mission hall, lecture\r\nroom, class rooms, &c., in addition to Cottage Homes for orphan and\r\ndestitute children, who are taught and trained in a manner suited to the\r\nfuture intended for them in Canada. The expenditure of the Institution\r\nis now about £1,500 a year, but an amount equal to that is wanted for\r\nenlargement of buildings, and other philanthropists will do well to call\r\nupon their brother Smith.\r\n\r\n_Children's Day Nursery_, The Terrace, Bishopgate Street, was first\r\nopened in 1870, to take care of the children in cases where the mothers,\r\nor other guardians, have to go to work.\r\n\r\nAbout 6,000 of the little ones are yearly looked after, at a cost of\r\nsomewhat under £200. Parties wishing to thus shelter their children must\r\nprove the latter's legitimacy, and bring a recommendation from employer\r\nor some one known to the manager.\r\n\r\n_Children's Emigration Homes_, St. Luke's Road.--Though ranking among\r\nour public institutions, the philanthropic movement of picking up the\r\nhuman waifs and strays of our dirty back streets may be said to have\r\nhitherto been almost solely the private work of our benevolent townsman,\r\nMr. Middlemore. The first inmate received at the Homes (in 1872) was a\r\nboy who had already been in prison three times, and the fact that that\r\nboy is now a prosperous man and the owner of a large farm in Canada,\r\nshould be the best of all claims to the sympathy and co operation of the\r\npublic in the beneficent work of placing out \"Street Arabs\" in new homes\r\nwhere they will have equal chances of getting on in the world. The batch\r\nof children leaving this town (June 11, 1884), comprised 110 boys and 50\r\ngirls, making the total number of 912 sent out by Mr. Middlemore in the\r\ntwelve years.--In connection with the Bloomsbury Institution there is\r\nalso a Children's Home, from which 23 children have been sent to Canada,\r\nand at which some 30 others are at present being trained ready to go.\r\n\r\n_Deaf and Dumb Institution_, Church Road, Edgbaston.--This is the only\r\ninstitution of its kind within a radius of a hundred miles, and was the\r\nsecond established in England. Its founder was Dr. De Lys, an eminent\r\nphysician, resident here in 1810, in which year a society was\r\nestablished for its formation. The first house occupied was in Calthorpe\r\nRoad (1812), Lord Calthorpe giving the use of the premises until the\r\nerection of the institution in Church Road, in 1814. The school, at\r\nfirst, would accommodate only a score of pupils, but from time to time\r\nadditions were made, and in 1858 the whole establishment was remodelled\r\nand enlarged, at a cost of £3,000, so that now there is room for 120.\r\nThe number on the books at Midsummer, 1883, was 109--64 boys and 45\r\ngirls. The year's receipt's amounted to £3,152 12s. 4d., and the\r\nexpenditure to £2,932 12s. 8d. The children, who are elected at the\r\nannual meeting of subscribers in September, are received from all parts\r\nof the kingdom, but must not be under eight or over thirteen years of\r\nage. Subscribers of a guinea have the right of voting at the elections,\r\nand the committee have also power to admit children, on an annual\r\npayment of £25. The parents or guardians of the elected candidates, must\r\npay £6 per year towards clothing, &c. The office of the Secretary is at\r\nCity Chambers, 82 New Street.\r\n\r\n_Friendless Girls_.--The Ladies' Association (established 1878) for the\r\nrecovery of girls who have given way to temptation for a short time, or\r\nwho have been convicted of a first offence, has been the means of\r\nrescuing many from the streets and from a life of crime. The Home is in\r\nSpring Road, and Mrs. Pike, Sir Harry's Road, is the treasurer, to whom\r\ncontributions can be sent; and that they will be welcome is shown by the\r\nfact that there is a balance at present against the Institution's funds.\r\n\r\n_Girls' Home_, Bath Row, established in 1851, to provide shelter for\r\nyoung women of good character, when out of situations. A free registry\r\nis kept, and over 300 girls avail themselves of the Home every year.\r\n\r\n_Girls' Training Institution_, George Road, Edgbaston, was opened in\r\n1862, to prepare young girls from twelve to fifteen, for domestic\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n_Industrial and Reformatory Schools_.--Gem Street Industrial School, for\r\nthe recovery of boys who had began a life of crime, was opened in 1850,\r\nand at the close of 1883 it contained 149 boys, under the charge of nine\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of Her Majesty's Inspector, the boys cost 7s.\r\n8d. per head per week, but there was an industrial profit of £601 11s.\r\n4d., £309 0s. 11d. having been received for hire of boys' labour. The\r\nTreasury paid £1,350 14s., the rates no less than £1,007 18s. 11d., and\r\nsubscriptions brought in £83 13s. Of 125 discharges, only 40 per cent,\r\nwere reported to be doing well, 4 per cent, convicted, 16 per cent,\r\ndoubtful, and as many as 40 per cent, unknown.--_Penn Street_ School,\r\nan establishment of a similar character, was certified in Jan., 1863.\r\nThere were 60 boys and 5 officers. The boys cost only 5s. 6d. per head\r\nper week. The school received £67 16s. 11d. from the Treasury, £275 0s.\r\n10d. from the rates, £93 2s. from subscriptions, and £100 9s. 3d. from\r\nthe hire of boy labour. There is an industrial profit of £136 19s, 11d.\r\nOf 37 discharges 70 per cent, are said to be doing well, 6 per cent, to\r\nbe re-convicted, 3 per cent, dead, and 21 per cent, unknown.--At\r\n_Shustoke_ School, certified in February, 1868, there were 130 boys,\r\nunder 11 officers. The boys cost 6s. 8d. per head per week. £1,580 17s.\r\n11d. had been received from the Treasury; £1,741 16s. from the rates, of\r\nwhich, however, £1,100 had been spent in building, &c.; industrial\r\nprofit, £109 3s. 7d. Of 27 discharges 74 per cent, were reported to be\r\ndoing well, 18 per cent, to be convicted, 4 per cent, to be doubtful,\r\nand 4 per cent, to be unknown.--_Saltley_ Reformatory was established in\r\n1852. There were 91 boys under detention and 16 on license at the time\r\nof the inspector's visit; 9 officers. This school received £1,371 14s.\r\n3d. from the Treasury, £254 19s. 1d. from the rates, and £99 16s. 6d.\r\nfrom subscriptions. The boys cost 6s 8d. per head per week, and there\r\nwas £117 9s. 10d. industrial profit, representing the produce of their\r\nlabour. Of 74 boys discharged in 1879-81, 69 per cent are reported to be\r\ndoing well, 19 per cent. to be reconvicted, and 12 per cent. unknown.--\r\nAt _Stoke Farm_ Reformatory, established in 1853, there were 78 boys\r\nunder detention, in charge of 10 officers; and 19 on license. Stoke\r\nreceived £1,182 19s. 8d. from the Treasury, £102 17s. 6d. from the\r\nrates, and £100 from subscriptions. The boys cost 6s. 11d. per head per\r\nweek, and there was an industrial profit of £18 14s. 11d. Of 62 boys\r\ndischarged in 1879-81, 76 per cent, were reported to be doing well, 16\r\nper cent. to be convicted of crime, 5 per cent. doubtful, 11/2 per cent.\r\ndead, 11/2 per cent. unknown.\r\n\r\n_Licensed Victuallers' Asylum_, Bristol Road, founded in 1848, to\r\nreceive and maintain for life distressed members of the trade and their\r\nwives or widows.--The Secretary is Mr. H.C. Edwards, The Quadrant, New\r\nStreet.--See. \"_Trade Societies_.\"\r\n\r\n_Little Sisters' Home_.--Founded in 1864, by three French and two\r\nEnglish members of the Catholic \"Order of Little Sisters of the Poor,\"\r\nthe first home being at one of the large houses in the Crescent, where\r\nthey sheltered, fed, and clothed about 80 aged or broken-down men and\r\nwomen. In 1874 the Sisters removed to their present establishment, at\r\nHarborne, where they minister to nearly double the number. The whole of\r\nthis large family are provided for out of the scraps and odds-and-ends\r\ngathered by the Sisters from private houses, shops, hotels, restaurants,\r\nand bars of the town, the smallest scraps of material crusts of bread,\r\nremains of meat, even to cigar ends, all being acceptable to the black\r\nrobed ladies of charity daily seen in the town on their errand of mercy.\r\nThough essentially a Catholic institution, the \"Little Sisters\" bestow\r\ntheir charity irrespective of creed, Protestants being admitted and\r\nallowed freely to follow their own religious notions, the only\r\npreference made being in favour of the most aged and destitute.\r\n\r\n_Magdalen Asylum and Refuge_.--First established in 1828, the chapel in\r\nBroad Street being opened in 1839. Removed to Clarendon Road, Edgbaston,\r\nin 1860. There are usually from 35 to 40 inmates, whose labour provides\r\nfor great part of the yearly expenditure; and it is well that it is so,\r\nfor the subscriptions and donations from the public are not sent in so\r\nfreely as could be wished. The treasurer is Mr. S.S. Lloyd.\r\n\r\n_Medical Mission_.--Opened in Floodgate Street, Deritend, in 1875. While\r\nresembling other medical charities for the relief of bodily sickness,\r\nthis mission has for its chief aim the teaching of the Gospel to the\r\nsick poor, and in every house that may be visited. That the more worldly\r\npart of the mission is not neglected is shown by the fact that the\r\nexpenditure for the year ending Michaelmas, 1883, reached £643.\r\n\r\n_Night Refuges_.--Mr. A.V. Fordyce, in July, 1880, opened a night asylum\r\nin Princess Road, for the shelter of homeless and destitute boys, who\r\nwere supplied with bed and breakfast. The necessity for such an\r\ninstitution was soon made apparent by larger premises being required,\r\nand the old police station, corner of Bradford Street and Alcester\r\nStreet, was taken. This has been turned into a \"Home,\" and it is never\r\nshort of occupants, other premises being opened in 1883, close to\r\nDeritend Bridge, for the casual night-birds, the most promising of whom\r\nare transferred to the Home after a few days' testing. A somewhat\r\nsimilar Refuge for Girls has also been established, and if properly\r\nsupported by the public, these institutions must result in much good.\r\n\r\n_Nurses_.--Tim Birmingham and Midland Counties' Training Institution for\r\nNurses, organised in 1868, has its \"Home\" in the Crescent. It was\r\nfounded for the purpose of bringing skilled nursing to the homes of\r\nthose who would otherwise be unable to obtain intelligent aid in\r\ncarrying out the instructions of their medical attendants. The\r\nsubscription list for 1882 amounted to £282 1s., and the sum to the\r\ncredit of the nurses pension fund to £525 1s. The committee earnestly\r\nappeal for increased support, to enable them to extend the work of the\r\ninstitution, from which at present the services of four nurses are\r\ngranted to the District Nursing Society, Newhall Street, for attendance\r\non the sick poor. The staff included 66 trained nurses, with 18\r\nprobationers, the latter passing for their training through the General,\r\nChildren's, and Homoeopathic Hospitals. The nurses from the \"Home\"\r\nattend on an average over 500 families in the year, those from the\r\nDistrict Society conferring their services on nearly 200 other families.\r\n\r\n_Protestant Dissenting Charity School_, Graham Street.--This is one of\r\nthe oldest of our philanthropical institutions, having been established\r\nin 1760--the first general meeting of subscribers being held June 22,\r\n1761. The first house taken for the purposes of the charity was in New\r\nMeeting Street, and both boys and girls were admitted, but since 1813\r\nonly girls have received its benefits. These are taken from any\r\nlocality, and of any Protestant denomination, being housed, fed,\r\nclothed, educated and trained for domestic servants. There are usually\r\nabout 45 to 48 inmates, the cost per child averaging in 1883 (for 56\r\ngirls) nearly £20 per head. At the centenary in 1861 a fund of nearly\r\n£1,500 was raised by public subscription in aid of the institution,\r\nwhich has but a small income from investments. Subscribers of a guinea\r\nper year have the right of nominating and voting for the admission of\r\none child every year. The present home in Graham Street was erected in\r\n1839, and application should be made to the matron for information or\r\nfor servant girls.\r\n\r\n_Sanatorium_, situated at Blackwell, near Bromsgrove.--This\r\nestablishment, which cost £15,750, of which £2,000 was given by Miss\r\nRyland, was built to provide a temporary home, with pure air, rest, and\r\nnourishing diet for convalescent patients, who otherwise might have had\r\nto pine away in the close-built quarters of this and neighbouring towns.\r\nThe buildings, which will accommodate sixty persons, were opened April\r\n16, 1873, and take the place of a smaller establishment to which Miss\r\nRyland had devoted for some years a house at Sparkbrook. The average\r\nnumber of inmates is put at fifty, and the number who passed through the\r\nhouse in 1883 was 1,052, the expenditure for the year being £1,780 8s.\r\nThe income was derived from annual subscriptions, £901 10s.; special\r\nsubscriptions, £347 11s. 6d.; paid by hospitals for maintenance of\r\npatients, £192 6s.; grant from the General Hospital, £26 5s.; share of\r\nHospital Saturday collection, £211 Os. 4d. The Secretary, from whom all\r\ninformation can be received as to terms of special and other tickets, is\r\nMr. E.J. Bigwood, 3, Temple Row West.\r\n\r\n_Servants' Home and Training Institution_, established in 1860, finds\r\nshelter for a time to as many as 240 young women in the course of a\r\nyear, many looking upon it as the only home they have when out of a\r\nsituation. In connection with it is a \"training school\" and laundry,\r\nwhere a score or more girls are taught. Both parts of the institution\r\npay their way, receipts and expenditure (£180 and £350 respectively)\r\ngenerally balancing. The Servants' Home is at 30, Bath Row, where there\r\nis a Registry for servants, and also for sick and monthly nurses.\r\n\r\n_Town Mission_--Established in 1837, and re-modelled in 1850. This\r\ninstitution seeks work in a variety of ways, its agents visiting the\r\nhomes of the poor, the wards of the Hospitals, the lodging-houses, and\r\neven the bedsides of the patients in the smallpox and fever hospitals.\r\nIn addition to the providing and looking after the \"Cabmen's Rests,\" of\r\nwhich there are sixteen in the town, the Mission employs a Scripture\r\nreader specially to deal with the deaf and dumb members of the\r\ncommunity, about 200 in number. At the Noel Road Refuge (opened in 1859)\r\nabout 40 inmates are received yearly, and at Tindal House (opened in\r\n1864) about half that number, the two institutions having (to end of\r\n1883) sheltered 1,331 females, of whom nearly a thousand have been\r\nbrought back to moral and industrious habits. The income of the Society\r\nfor 1883 was £1,690 17s. 3d., the expenditure being a little over that\r\namount, though the laundries connected with the Refuges more than pay\r\ntheir way. The office is at the Educational Chambers; 90, New Street.\r\n\r\n_Young Men's Christian Association_.--Instituted in 1849; incorporated\r\nin 1873. For many years its meetings were held at the Clarendon\r\nChambers, but when the notorious \"Sultan Divan\" was closed in Needless\r\nAlley, it was taken for the purposes of this institution, the most\r\nappropriate change of tenancy that could possibly be desired, the\r\nattractions of the glaring dancing-rooms and low-lived racket giving\r\nplace to comfortable reading-rooms, a cosy library, and healthy\r\namusements. Young men of all creeds may here find a welcome, and\r\nstrangers to the town will meet friends to guide them in choice of\r\ncompanions, or in securing comfortable homes.--A similar Association is\r\nthat of the Church of England Y.M.C.A., at 30, Paradise Street, which\r\nwas commenced in 1849, and numbers several hundred members.--At a\r\nConference held Nov. 24, 1880, it was decided to form a Midland District\r\nUnion of Y.M.C.A.s in this and the surrounding counties.\r\n\r\n_Young Women's Christian Association_, 3, Great Charles Street.--The\r\nidea of forming an institute for young women was first mooted in 1874, a\r\nhouse being taken for the purpose in Colmore Row in 1876, but it was\r\nremoved to Great Charles Street in 1882, where lodgings may be obtained\r\nfor 2s. 6d. a week. From returns sent in from various branches in\r\nconnection with the Association, it would appear that the number of\r\nmembers in Birmingham was 1,500, which says much or its popularity among\r\nthe class it was intended to benefit.\r\n\r\n~Philanthropic Trust Funds.~--That our predecessors forgot not charity\r\nis well proved, though some of the \"Trusts\" read strangely in these\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n_Apprenticing Poor Boys_.--A favourite bequest in past days was the\r\nleaving of funds for apprenticing poor lads to useful trades, and when\r\nworkmen were so scarce and valuable that the strong arm of the law was\r\nbrought in to prevent their emigrating or removing, doubtless it was a\r\nuseful charity enough. Now-a-days the majority of masters do not care\r\nabout the small premiums usually paid out of these trusts, and several\r\nsuch charities have been lost sight of or become amalgamated with\r\nothers. The funds, however, left by George Jackson, 1696, and by Richard\r\nScott, 1634, are still in the hands of trustees, and to those whom it\r\nmay concern, Messrs. Horton and Lee, Newhall street, solicitors to both\r\ntrusts, will give all needful information.\r\n\r\n_Banner's Charity_.--Richard and Samuel Banner, in 1716, left some land\r\nat Erdington, towards providing clothing for two old widows and\r\nhalf-a-dozen old men, the balance, if any, to be used in apprenticing\r\npoor boys in Birmingham,\r\n\r\n_Dudley Trust_.--Mr. William Dudley, at his decease in 1876 left\r\n£100,000 on trust for the purpose of assisting young tradesmen\r\ncommencing business on their own account, to relieve aged tradesmen of\r\nthe town who had not succeeded in life, and lastly to benefit the\r\ncharities of the town. The rules require that applicants must be under\r\nfifty years of age; that they must reside within the limits of the\r\nborough; that they must not have been set up in business more than three\r\nyears; that they must give satisfactory proof of their honesty,\r\nsobriety, and industry; and that they must give satisfactory security to\r\nthe Trustees, either personal, viz., by bond with two or more sureties\r\n[each surety must give two or three references], or upon freehold,\r\ncopyhold, or leasehold properties. All these conditions being\r\nsatisfactorily met, the loans, which will be made free of cost, will\r\nbear interest at 2-1/2 per cent. per annum, payable half-yearly, and\r\nmust be repaid within five years, and if the money is wanted for more\r\nthan two years, repayments by instalments must then commence. The\r\nbenefactions to aged persons take the shape of grants, annual or\r\notherwise, not exceeding £20 in any one year, in favour of persons who\r\nfulfil the following requirements: They must be of the age of sixty\r\nyears at least, they must have been tradesmen within the limits of the\r\nborough; and they must be able to show to the satisfaction of the\r\nTrustees that they are of good character and need assistance, and that\r\nthey have not received any parochial relief. The Trustees have made\r\nseveral large grants to charitable institutions. Offices: 20, Temple\r\nRow.\r\n\r\n_Fentham's Charity_.--In 1712 George Fentham left about one hundred\r\nacres of land in Handsworth and Erdington Parishes, in trust, to teach\r\npoor children to read, and to clothe poor widows. The property, when\r\ndevised, was worth £20 per year. At the end of the century it was valued\r\nat £100 per year; and it now brings in nearly £460. The twenty children\r\nreceiving the benefits of this charity are admitted to the Blue Coat\r\nSchool, and are distinguished by their dress of dark green. Some fifty\r\nwidows yearly share in the clothing gifts.\r\n\r\n_Food and Clothing_.--John Crowley, in 1709, bequeathed an annuity o\r\n20s. chargeable on property in the Lower Priory, to be expended in\r\n\"sixpenny bread\" for the poor at Christmas.--Some land at Sutton\r\nColdfield was left, in 1681, by John Hopkins, to provide clothing and\r\nfood for the poor of St. Martin's.--Palmer's Charity, 1867, finds about\r\n£40 per annum, which is distributed among eighty recipients selected by\r\nthe Town Council, the majority being poor old women, who go for their\r\ndoles Dec. 12th.--In addition to the above there have been a number of\r\nminor charities left to the churchwardens for providing food and\r\nclothing which have either been lost sight of, or mixed up with others,\r\nsome dating as far back as 1629-30.\r\n\r\n_George Hill's Charity_ is now of the value of nearly £5,000, bringing\r\nin about £120 yearly. Of this 52s. goes to the churchwardens of the\r\nparish church to provide bread for the most necessitous and aged poor;\r\n20s. to the incumbent of Deritend, and the residue in pensions of not\r\nmore than £20 to decayed schoolmasters and schoolmistresses.\r\n\r\n_Hollier's Charity_ was devised in 1789, the land now known as Highgate\r\nPark (originally 10 acres) being left to clothe, annually, twenty poor\r\npersons, twelve from Birmingham and eight from Aston. The purchase money\r\npaid by the Corporation has been invested, and, under the direction of\r\nthe Charity Commissioners, the income of this charity is appropriated\r\nthus:--£50 for clothing for twelve poor men or women of Birmingham, and\r\neight ditto of Aston; £25 for relieving deserving and necessitous\r\npersons discharged from Borough Lunatic Asylum; £150 to the Dispensaries\r\nof Birmingham and Aston; £25 each to the Children's Hospital and the\r\nSanatorium; and the remainder to the General Hospital.\r\n\r\n_James's Trust_, of 1869, which realises about £1,000 per year, was left\r\nto provide homes and pensions for deserving widows and others; five\r\nannuities for poor and decayed gentlewomen; and a scholarship at the\r\nGrammar School. The Secretary is the Vicar of St. Clement's, Nechells.\r\n\r\n_Kylcuppe's Charity_.--Sept. 19, 1611. Richard Kylcuppe devised certain\r\nland at Sparkbrook for charitable purposes, the income of which is now\r\nhanded to the General Hospital and General Dispensary, as nearly as\r\npossible following the testator's wishes.\r\n\r\n_Lench's Trust_, which dates from 1539, is one of the most important\r\ncharities of the town, and has an income of over £3,000 a year at\r\npresent. The original objects of the trust were repairing the streets of\r\nthe town and relief to poor. From time to time other charities have been\r\nincorporated, and the funds administered with those of Lench's Trust.\r\nAmong these are the \"Bell Rope\" fund for purchasing ropes for St.\r\nMartin's Belfry, the donor of which is not known; Colmore's Charity,\r\ndating from 1585, for relieving the poor and repairing streets;\r\nRedhill's and Shilton's (about 1520), for like purposes; Kylcuppe's\r\n1610, for the poor, and a small sum towards repairing the church;\r\nVesey's 1583, known as the \"Loveday Croft\" gift; Ward's 1573, and\r\nWrexam's, 1568, both for gifts to the poor on Good Friday; Ann Scott's,\r\n1808, providing small amounts to be given to the inmates of the\r\nAlmshouses, &c. The Trust now maintains four sets of almshouses\r\n(Conybere Street, Hospital Street, Ravenhurst Street, and Ladywood),\r\naccommodating 184 inmates, all women, who receive 5s. a week each, with\r\nfiring, medical advice and medicines when necessary, and sundry other\r\nsmall comforts beloved by old grannies. The solicitors to the Trust are\r\nMessrs. Horton and Lee, Newhall Street. The income of Lench's Trust for\r\nthe year 1883 amounted to £3,321 10s., of which £1,825 14s. went to the\r\nalmswomen, £749 1s. 8d. for matrons, doctors, and expenses at the\r\nalmshouses, £437 9s. 4d. for repairs, insurance, rates, and taxes, and\r\n£309 5s. for clerks, collectors, auditors, law and surveyor's charges,\r\nprinting, &c.\r\n\r\n_Milward's Charity_.--John Milward in 1654 left property then worth £26\r\nper annum and the Red Lion public-house (worth another £26, but which\r\ncould never be traced out), to be devided between the governors of the\r\nFree Grammar Schools of Birmingham and Haverfordwest and Brazennose\r\nCollege, for the support at the said college of one student from the\r\nabove schools in rotation. The Red Lion having been swallowed up at a\r\ngulp; the other property would appear to have been kept as a\r\nnibbling-cake, for till the Charity Commissioners visited here in 1827\r\nno scholar had ever been sent to college by its means. The railways and\r\ncanals have taken most of the property of this trust, the invested\r\ncapital arising from the sales bringing in now about £650 per year,\r\nwhich is divided between the two schools and the college above named,\r\nthe Birmingham portion being sufficient to pay for two scholarships\r\nyearly.\r\n\r\nThe _Nichol Charity_ provides for the distribution of bread and coals to\r\nabout 100 people on New Year's Day, by the vicar and churchwardens of\r\nSt. David's.\r\n\r\n_Old Maids and Widows_.--About £40 per year are divided by the Rector\r\nand Churchwardens of St. Philip's amongst ten old maids \"or single women\r\nof virtuous character,\" and twelve poor widows attending divine service\r\nthere, the invested money arising from Shelton's Charity, 1826, and\r\nWilkinson's Charity, 1830.--Thomas Pargeter (of Foxcote) in 1867, left\r\nmoney in trust, to provide annuities of £20 each, to unmarried ladies of\r\nfifty-five or more, professing Unitarianism, and about 100 are now\r\nreaping the fruit of his charity. Messrs. Harding and Son, Waterloo\r\nStreet, are the solicitors.\r\n\r\n_Ridduck's Trust_, for putting poor boys out apprentice, was devised in\r\n1728, the property consisting of a farm at Winson Green. By direction of\r\nthe Court of Chancery, the income is now divided, £70 to Gem Street Free\r\nIndustrial School, and £20 to the British School, Severn Street. The\r\nTrustees include the Mayor, the Rectors of St. Martin's, St. Philip's,\r\nSt. Thomas's, St. George's, several Nonconformist ministers, and the\r\nRegistrar of the Society of Friends.\r\n\r\n_Preaching Sermons_.--By Salusbury's Charity, 1726, the Rectors of St.\r\nMartin's and St. Philip's are entitled to the sum of 15s to preach\r\nsermons once a year for the benefit of the Blue Coat School--Ingram's\r\nCharity, 1818, consisting of the yearly interest of £500 4 per cent.\r\nIndia Stock, was intended to insure the preaching of an annual sermon on\r\nthe subject of kindness to animals (especially to the horse) by a local\r\nclergyman of the Established Church, but the Governors of King Edward's\r\nSchool, who are the trustees, have obtained the sanction of the Charity\r\nCommissioner to a scheme under which sermons on kindness to animals may\r\ntake the form of one or more free lectures on the kind treatment of\r\nanimals, and especially of the horse, to be delivered in any place of\r\npublic worship, or other building or room approved by the trustees, and\r\nnot necessarily, as heretofore, by a clergyman of the Established\r\nChurch, and in a church.\r\n\r\n_Scripture Reading_.--In 1858 Admiral Duff left a sum of money, which\r\nbrings in about £45 per year, for the maintenance of a Scripture Reader\r\nfor the town of Birmingham. The trustee of this land is the Mayor for\r\nthe time being, and the Scripture Reader may be heard of at the Town\r\nClerk's office.\r\n\r\n_The Whittingham Charity_, distributed at St. James's, Ashted, in March,\r\nfurnishes gifts to about eighty poor people (principally widows), who\r\nreceive blankets, sheets, quilts, flannel, &c., in addition to bread and\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\n~Philosophical Society.~--A society with this name was formed in 1794\r\nfor the promulgation of scientific principles among mechanics. Its\r\nmeetings were held in an old warehouse in the Coach Yard, and from the\r\nfact that many workmen from the Eagle Foundry attended the lectures,\r\ndelivered mainly by Mr. Thomas Clarke, the members acquired the name of\r\n\"the cast-iron philosophers.\" Another society was formed in 1800, for\r\nthe diffusion of scientific knowledge amongst the middle and higher\r\nclasses, and by the year 1814 it was possessed of a handsome Lecture\r\nTheatre, a large Museum, with good collections of fossils and minerals,\r\na Library, Reading Room, &c., in Cannon Street. Like many other useful\r\ninstitutions of former days, the philosophical has had to give way to\r\nthe realistic, its library of dead men's writings, and its fossils of\r\nthe ancient world, vanishing in face of the reporters of to-day's\r\ndoings, the ubiquitous throbs of the \"Walter\" and \"Hoe\" steam presses\r\nresounding where erst the voice of Science in chronicling the past\r\nforeshadowed the future.\r\n\r\n~Pillory.~--This ancient machine for the punishment of prigs formerly\r\nstood in High Street. The last time it was used was in 1813. We pillory\r\npeople in print now, and pelt them with pen and ink. The Act for\r\nabolishing this method of punishment was not passed until June 30, 1837.\r\nWhat became of the pillory here is not known, but there is, or was\r\nlately, a renovated specimen of the article at Coleshill.\r\n\r\n~Pinfold Street~ takes its name from the \"pound\" or \"pinfold\" that\r\nexisted there prior to 1752. There used to be another of these\r\nreceptacles for straying animals near to the Plough and Harrow in Hagley\r\nRoad, and a small corner of Smithfield was railed off for the like\r\npurpose when the Cattle market was there established. The \"Jacob\r\nWilsons\" of a previous date held a field under the Lords of the Manor\r\nwherein to graze their captured cattle, but one of the Town Criers\r\nmortgaged it, and his successors lost their right to the land which was\r\nsomewhere about Caroline Street.\r\n\r\n~Places of Worship.~--_Established Church_.--In 1620 there were 358\r\nchurches in Warwickshire, 130 in Staffordshire, and 150 in\r\nWorcestershire; but St. Martin's, Edgbaston, Aston, Deritend, and\r\nHandsworth, churches were all that Birmingham could boast of at the\r\nbeginning of last century, and the number had not been increased to a\r\nvery large extent even by the year 1800. As will be seen from the dates\r\ngiven in following pages, however, there was a goodly number of churches\r\nerected in the first half of this century, about the end of which period\r\na \"Church extension\" movement was set on foot. The success was so\r\napparent that a society was formed (Jan., 1865), and in March, 1867, it\r\nwas resolved to raise a fund of £50,000, for the purpose of at once\r\nerecting eight other new churches in the borough, Miss Ryland heading\r\nthe list of donations with the munificent gift of £10,000. It is\r\ndifficult to arrive at the amount expended on churches previous to 1840,\r\nbut the annexed list of churches, built, enlarged, or repaired in this\r\nneighbourhood from 1840 to 1875, will give an approximate idea of the\r\nlarge sums thus invested, the whole of which was raised solely by\r\nvoluntary contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acock's Green    ...   ...  £6,405\r\n  Aston Brook      ...   ...   5,000\r\n  Balsall Heath    ...   ...   8,500\r\n  Bishop Ryder's   ...   ...     886\r\n  Christ Church    ...   ...   1,000\r\n  Christ Church, Sparkbrook    9,163\r\n  Edgbaston  ...   ...   ...   2,200\r\n  Hay Mills  ...   ...   ...   6,500\r\n  Immanuel   ...   ...   ...   4,600\r\n  King's Heath     ...   ...   3,900\r\n  King's Norton    ...   ...   5,092\r\n  Moseley    ...   ...   ...   2,491\r\n  Saltley    ...   ...   ...   7,139\r\n  St. Alban's      ...   ...   2,800\r\n  St. Andrew's     ...   ...   4,500\r\n  St. Anne's ...   ...   ...   2,700\r\n  St. Anne's, Moseley    ...   7,500\r\n  St. Asaph's...   ...   ...   7,700\r\n  St. Augustine's  ...   ...   7,800\r\n  St. Barnabas'    ...   ...   3,500\r\n  St. Bartholomew's...   ...   1,260\r\n  St. Clement's    ...   ...   3,925\r\n  St. Cuthbert's   ...   ...   5,000\r\n  St. David's...   ...   ...   6,185\r\n  St. Gabriel's    ...   ...   4,307\r\n  St. George's Edgbaston ...   1,583\r\n  St. James's Edgbaston  ...   6,000\r\n  St. John's, Ladywood   ...   7,200\r\n  St. Lawrence's   ...   ...   4,380\r\n  St. Luke's ...   ...   ...   6,286\r\n  St. Martin's     ...   ...  30,134\r\n  St. Matthew's    ...   ...   4,850\r\n  St. Matthias's   ...   ...   5,361\r\n  St. Mary's ...   ...   ...   4,503\r\n  St. Mary's, Selly Oak  ...   5,400\r\n  St. Nicholas'    ...   ...   4,288\r\n  St. Paul's ...   ...   ...   1,400\r\n  St. Philip's     ...   ...   9,987\r\n  St. Saviour's    ...   ...   5,273\r\n  St. Silas's...   ...   ...   4,677\r\n  St. Stephen's    ...   ...   3,200\r\n  St. Stephen's, Selly Oak     3,771\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the above total of £228,336 expended on churches in or close to the\r\nborough, there should be added £57,640 expended in the erection, &c., of\r\nchurches close at hand in the adjoining diocese of Lichfield; £25,000\r\nlaid out at Coleshill, Northfield, and Solihull (the principal residents\r\nbeing from Birmingham); and a still further sum of £150,000 spent on\r\nChurch-school buildings. These figures even do not include the vast\r\namounts invested for the endowments of the several churches and schools,\r\nnor is aught reckoned for the value of the land or building materials\r\nwhere given, nor for the ornamental decorations, fonts, pulpits,\r\nwindows, and furnishings so munificently lavished on our local churches.\r\nSince the year 1875 it has been calculated that more than £100,000 has\r\nbeen devoted to similar local church-building purposes, so that in less\r\nthan fifty years much more than half-a-million sterling has been\r\nvoluntarily subscribed by the Churchmen of the neighbourhood for the\r\nreligious welfare and benefit of their fellow men. Still there is room\r\nfor more churches and for more preachers, and the Church Extension\r\nSociety are hoping that others will follow the example of the\r\n\"Landowner,\" who, in the early part of the year (1884) placed £10,000 in\r\nthe hands of the Bishop towards meeting the urgent need of additional\r\nprovision for the spiritual wants of the inhabitants.--Short notes of\r\nthe several churches can alone be given.\r\n\r\n_All Saints'_, in the street of that name, leading out of Lodge Road, is\r\na brick erection of fifty years' date, being consecrated September 28,\r\n1833. It was built to accommodate about 700 and cost £3,850, but in 1881\r\nit was enlarged and otherwise improved at an outlay of over £1,500, and\r\nnow finds sittings for 1,760, a thousand of the seats being free. The\r\nRev. P.E. Wilson, M.A., is the Rector and Surrogate, and the living\r\n(value £400) is in the gift of the Birmingham Trust. The Nineveh\r\nschoolroom is used for services on Sunday and Thursday evenings in\r\nconnection with All Saints.\r\n\r\n_All Saints'_, King's Heath, is built of stone in the perpendicular\r\nGothic style, and cost £3,200, the consecration taking place on April\r\n27th, 1860. There are sittings for 620, one half being free. The Rev. J.\r\nWebster, M.A., is the Vicar; the living (value £220) being in the gift\r\nof the Vicar of Moseley, King's Heath ecclesiastical parish being formed\r\nout of Moseley parish in 1863.\r\n\r\n_All Saints'_, Small Heath.--Rev. G.F.B. Cross, M.A., Vicar. Soon after\r\nthe death of the Rev. J. Oldknow, D.D., of Holy Trinity, in 1874, it was\r\nresolved to carry out his dying wishes by erecting a church in the\r\nfast-filling district of Small Heath. At first the iron building\r\nformerly used as a place of worship in Cannon Hill Park was put up, and\r\nthe Vicar was instituted in October, 1875. The foundation-stone of a\r\npermanent building was laid Sept. 8, 1882, which accommodates over 1,000\r\nworshippers. That part of the future \"Oldknow Memorial Church\" at\r\npresent finished, comprising the nave, north aisle, and north transept,\r\nwith seating for nearly 700 (all free), was consecrated July 28, 1883.\r\nThe patronage is vested in trustees, the incumbent's stipend being £150.\r\n\r\n_All Saints'_, Stechford.--A temporary church of iron and wood, erected\r\nat a cost of £620, to accommodate 320 persons, all seats being free, was\r\ndedicated Dec. 18, 1877.\r\n\r\n_Aston Church_.--It is impossible to fix the date of erection of the\r\nfirst church for the parish of Aston, but that it must have been at a\r\nvery early period is shown by the entry in the Domesday Book relative to\r\nthe manor. The parish itself formerly included Bordesley and Deritend,\r\nNechells and Saltley, Erdington and Witton, Castle Bromwich, Ward End,\r\nand Water Orton, an area so extensive that the ecclesiastical income was\r\nvery considerable. In Henry III.'s reign the Dean and Chapter of\r\nLichfield received twenty marks yearly out of the fruits of the rectory,\r\nthe annual value of which was sufficient to furnish £26 13s. 4d. over\r\nand above the twenty marks. Records are in existence showing that the\r\nchurch (which was dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul) was considerably\r\nenlarged about 300 years after the Conquest, and a renovation was\r\ncarried out nearly a century back, but the alterations made during the\r\nlast few years (1878-84) have been so extensive that practically it may\r\nbe said the edifice has been rebuilt. The seating capacity of the old\r\nchurch was limited to about 500, but three times that number of persons\r\nwill, in future, find accommodation, the cost of the extensions and\r\nalterations having been nearly £10,000. The ancient monuments, windows,\r\nand tablets have all been carefully replaced in positions corresponding\r\nto those they filled formerly, with many additions in the shape of\r\ncoloured glass, heraldic emblazonments, and chaste carvings in wood and\r\nstone. The old church, for generations past, has been the centre-point\r\nof interest with local antiquarians, as it was, in the days far gone,\r\nthe chosen last resting-place of so many connected with our ancient\r\nhistory--the Holtes, the Erdingtons, the Devereux, the Ardens, the\r\nHarcourts, the Bracebridgss, Clodshalls, Bagots, &c. Here still may be\r\nseen the stone and alabaster effigies of lords and ladies who lived in\r\nthe time of the Wars of the Roses, two showing by their dress that while\r\none was Lancasterian, the other followed the fortunes of York. The\r\ntablets of the Holte' family, _temp_. Elizabeth and Charles, and the\r\nDevereux monument of the Jacobean era, are well preserved, while all\r\naround the shields and arms of the ancient families, with their many\r\nquarterings, form the best heraldic collection anywhere near Birmingham.\r\nThe parish registers date from the 16th century, and the churchwardens\r\naccounts are preserved from the year 1652. Among the facts recorded in\r\nthe former we may note the burial of the dozen or so Royalist soldiers\r\nwho lost their lives while defending Aston Hall from the attacks made on\r\nit by the Birmingham men in December, 1643; while in both there are\r\nquaint entries innumerable, and full of curious interest to the student\r\nand historian. The Rev. W. Eliot, M.A., the present vicar, was\r\ninstituted in 1876 (commencing duty Feb. 25, 1877), the living (£1,600\r\nvalue) being in the presentation of trustees. In connection with the\r\nChurch, there are Mission Rooms in Tower Road and in Alfred Street, with\r\nSunday Schools, Bible classes, Dorcas, and other societies. The first\r\nportion of the late additions to the Church was consecrated July 5,\r\n1880; the new chancel on Sept. 8, 1883\r\n\r\n_Bishop Rider's_, a square-towered brick edifice in Gem Street, was\r\nbuilt in 1837-38, the laying of the foundation stone (August 23, 1837)\r\nbeing characterised by the almost unheard-of conduct of the low denizens\r\nof the neighbourhood, who pelted the Bishop of Lichfield with mud on the\r\noccasion. The consecration took place Dec. 18, 1838, and the building\r\ncost £4,600. The living, valued at £300, is in the hands of trustees,\r\nthe present vicar being the Rev. J.P. Gardiner. The vicarage, which was\r\ncompleted in 1862 at a cost of £2,240, is in Sutton Street, Aston Road--\r\ntoo near a residence to the church not being deemed advisable even\r\nfive-and-twenty years after the opening ceremony of 1837. In 1879 the\r\ngalleries were removed, and the church re-pewed and otherwise renovated,\r\nthe re-opening taking place July 28, there being now 860 free sittings.\r\n\r\n_Christ Church_, New Street.--At first known as \"The Free Church,\" this\r\nedifice was for no less than ten years in the hands of the builders. The\r\ncornerstone was laid July 22, 1805, by Lord Dartmouth, in the absence of\r\nGeorge III., who had promised, but was too ill, to be present. His\r\nMajesty, however, sent £1,000 towards the building fund. It was\r\nconsecrated July 13, 1813; finished in 1816; clock put in 1817. The\r\npatron is the Bishop of Worcester, and to the living (valued at £350),\r\nis attached a Prebendary in Lichfield Cathedral. The present Vicar,\r\nsince 1881, is the Rev. E.R. Mason, M.A. There is accommodation for\r\n1,500, all the seats being free, but at one time the worshippers were\r\nlimited in their freedom of sitting by the males having to take their\r\nplaces on one side and the females on the other, a custom which gave\r\nrise to the following epigram:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Our churches and chapels we generally find\r\n  Are the places where men to the women are joined;\r\n  But at Christ Church, it seems, they are more cruelhearted,\r\n  For men and their wives go there and get parted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMission services in connection with Christ Church are held in the\r\nPinfold Street and Fleet Street Schoolrooms.\r\n\r\n_Christ Church_, Gillott Road, Summerfield. The foundation stone of a\r\nchurch to be erected to the memory of the late Rev. George Lea (for 43\r\nyears connected with Christ Church and St. George's, Edgbaston) was laid\r\nNov. 27, 1883. It is intended to accommodate 850 persons, and will cost\r\nabout £8,000, exclusive of a tower 110ft. high which will be added\r\nafterwards at a further cost of £1,200.\r\n\r\n_Christ Church_, Quinton, was erected in 1841, at a cost of £2,500, and\r\nwill seat 600, two-thirds being free. The living is valued at £200, is\r\nin the gift of the Rector of Halesowen (in whose parish Quinton was\r\nformerly included), and is held by the Rev. C.H. Oldfield, B.A.\r\n\r\n_Christ Church_, Sparkbrook, is a handsome Gothic erection, built on\r\nland given by Mr. S.S. Lloyd, the first stone being laid April 5, 1866,\r\nand the opening ceremony on October 1, 1867. The living, a perpetual\r\ncuracy, is in the gift of trustees, and is valued at £350 per annum, and\r\nhas been held hitherto by the Rev. G. Tonge, M.A. The building of the\r\nchurch cost nearly £10,000, the accommodation being sufficient for 900\r\npersons, one-half the seats being free. The stained window in chancel to\r\nthe memory of Mrs. S.S. Lloyd, is said by some to be the most beautiful\r\nin Birmingham, the subject being the Resurrection. There are Mission\r\nRooms and Sunday Schools in Dolobran Road, Montpellier Street, Long\r\nStreet, and Stratford Road, several thousands having been spent in their\r\nerection.\r\n\r\n_Christ Church_, Yardley Wood, was built and endowed by the late John\r\nTaylor, Esq., in 1848, the consecration taking place April 4, 1849.\r\nVicarage, value £185; patrons, trustees; Vicar, Rev. C.E. Beeby, B.A.\r\nSeats 260, the 60 being free.\r\n\r\n_Edgbaston Old Church_.--It is not known when the first church was built\r\non this site, some writers having gone so far back as to fix the year\r\n777 as the probable date. The present edifice, though it incorporates\r\nsome few remains of former erections, and will always be known as the\r\n\"old\" church, really dates but from 1809-10, when it was re-built\r\n(opened Sept 10, 1810) but, as the Edgbastonians began to increase and\r\nmultiply rapidly after that time, it was found necessary to add a nave\r\nand aisle in 1857. There is now only accommodation for 670, and but a\r\nhundred or so of the seats are free, so that possibly in a few more\r\nyears the renovators and restorers will be busy providing another new\r\nold church for us. The patron is Lord Calthorpe, and the living is\r\nvalued at £542, but the power of presenting has only been exercised\r\nthree times during the last 124 years, the Rev. John Prynne Parkes\r\nPixell, who was appointed vicar in 1760, being succeeded by his son in\r\n1794, who held the living fifty-four years. At his death, in 1848, the\r\nRev. Isaac Spooner, who had for the eleven previous years been the first\r\nincumbent of St. George's, Edgbaston, was inducted, and remained vicar\r\ntill his death, July, 1884. In the Church there are several monuments to\r\nmembers of the Calthorpe family, and one in memory of Mr. Joshua\r\nScholefield, the first M.P. for Birmingham, and also some\r\nrichly-coloured windows and ancient-dated tablets connected with the\r\noldest families of the Middlemores and others.\r\n\r\n_Hall Green Church_ was built in Queen Anne's reign, and has seats for\r\n475, half free. It is a vicarage (value £175), in the gift of trustees,\r\nand now held by the Rev. R. Jones, B.A.\r\n\r\n_Handsworth Church_.--St. Mary's, the mother church of the parish, was\r\nprobably erected in the twelfth century, but has undergone time's\r\ninevitable changes of enlargements, alterations, and rebuildings, until\r\nlittle, if any, of the original structure could possibly be shown. Great\r\nalterations were made during the 15th and 17th centuries, and again\r\nabout 1759, and in 1820; the last of all being those of our own days.\r\nDuring the course of the \"restoration,\" now completed, an oval tablet\r\nwas taken down from the pediment over the south porch, bearing the\r\ninscription of \"John Hall and John Hopkins, churchwardens, 1759,\" whose\r\neconomising notions had led them to cut the said tablet out of an old\r\ngravestone, the side built into the wall having inscribed on its face,\r\n\"The bodye of Thomas Lindon, who departed this life the 10 of April,\r\n1675, and was yeares of age 88.\" The cost of the rebuilding has been\r\nnearly £11,000, the whole of which has been subscribed, the reopening\r\ntaking place Sept. 28, 1878. There are several ancient monuments in fair\r\npreservation, and also Chantrey's celebrated statue of Watts. The living\r\nis valued at £1,500, the Rector, the Rev. W. Randall, M.A., being his\r\nown patron. The sittings in the church are (with a few exceptions only)\r\nall free and number over 1,000, Sunday and other services being also\r\nheld in a Mission Room at Hamstead.\r\n\r\n_Holy Trinity_.--The first stone of the Church of the Holy Trinity in\r\nCamp Hill, was placed in position Sept. 29, 1820. The building was\r\nconsecrated Jan. 23, 1823, and opened for services March 16 following.\r\nThe cost was £14,325, and the number of sittings provided 1,500, half to\r\nbe free. The services have from the first been markedly of a Ritualistic\r\ncharacter, and the ornate decorations of the church have been therefore\r\nmost appropriate. The living (value £230) is a vicarage in the gift of\r\ntrustees, and is at present held by the Rev. A.H. Watts, who succeeded\r\nthe Rev. R.W. Enraght after the latter's suspension and imprisonment.--\r\nSee \"_Ritualism_.\"\r\n\r\n_Holy Trinity_, Birchfields.--First stone placed May 26, 1863;\r\nconsecrated May 17, 1864. Cost about £5,000. The living (value £320) is\r\na vicarage in the gift of the Rector of Handsworth, and is now held by\r\nthe Rev. P.T. Maitland, who \"read himself in\" May 16, 1875.\r\n\r\n_Holy Trinity_, North Harborne, was built in 1838-39 at a cost of\r\n£3,750, and will seat 700, one half being free. The living (value £300)\r\nis in the gift of the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield.\r\n\r\n_Immanuel Church_, Broad Street.--The foundation stone was laid July 12,\r\n1864; the consecration took place May 7, 1865; the cost of erection was\r\na little over £4,000; there are seats for 800, of which 600 are free;\r\nand the living (valued at £300), has been held until now by the Rev.\r\nC.H. Coleman, the presentation being in the hands of trustees. The\r\n\"Magdalen\" Chapel was formerly on the site.\r\n\r\n_Iron Churches_.--May 22, 1874, an edifice built of iron was opened for\r\nreligious purposes in Canon Hill Park, but the congregation that\r\nassembled were so scanty that in July, 1875, it was deemed expedient to\r\nremove it to Small Heath where it was used as a temporary \"Oldknow\r\nMemorial\" Church. Other iron churches have been utilised in the suburbs\r\nsince then, and there is now no novelty in such erections, a score of\r\nwhich may be found within half the number of miles.\r\n\r\n_St. Agnes'_, Moseley, off Wake Green Road.--The foundation stone was\r\nlaid October 3, 1883, and its estimated cost is put at about £8,000. At\r\npresent only a part sufficient to accommodate 400 persons is being\r\nproceeded with, but when completed the edifice will hold double that\r\nnumber, and will be 127 ft. long by 48 ft. wide, a tower and spire\r\nrising from the centre of the west end to a height of 137 ft.\r\n\r\n_St. Alban's_.--A Mission chapel, dedicated to St. Alban, was opened in\r\nLeopold Street in September, 1865. This now forms a school belonging to\r\nthe adjoining church, which was opened March 7, 1872. The curacy is held\r\nby the Revds. J.S. and T.B. Pollock, but the friends of those gentlemen\r\nhave since ejected a far handsomer edifice, the Church of St. Alban the\r\nMartyr, at the corner of Conybere Street and Ryland Street, at a cost\r\nestimated at £20,000--£1,500 being paid for the site. The first stone of\r\nthis magnificent building was laid January 31, 1880, the opening service\r\ntaking place at 6.30 a.m., May 3, 1881. There is free seating for 1,000\r\nin the new church, for 460 in St. Alban's, Leopold Street, and for a\r\nfurther 400 in the Mission Room--the services being entirely dependent\r\non the gifts to the offertory, &c. On the Saint's day the special\r\ncollections have for years been most remarkable, seldom less than £1,000\r\nbeing given, while occasionally the amount has been more than four times\r\nthat sum, The services are \"High Church,\" with three daily celebrations\r\nand seven on Sunday.\r\n\r\n_St. Andrew's_, Bordesley.--The foundation-stone was laid July 23, 1844,\r\nand consecration took place, Sept. 30, 1846. The cost of the building\r\nwas about £5,000, the site being given. The value of the living is £320,\r\nthe Bishop and trustees having the right of preferment alternately.\r\nThere is accommodation for 800, one-fourth of the seats being free. The\r\npresent Vicar is the Rev. J. Williamson, M.A. The iron-built church of\r\nS. Oswald, opposite Small Heath Park, Coventry-road, is attached to S.\r\nAndrew's.\r\n\r\n_St. Anne's_, Duddeston, consecrated Oct. 22, 1869, is a brick building,\r\ngiving accommodation for 810, half the seats being free. The Bishop\r\npresents the living, being of the nett value of £260. Rev. T.J. Haworth\r\nis the Vicar. Services also at the Mission Room, Great Francis Street.\r\n\r\n_St. Anne's_, Park Hill, Moseley.--This Chapel-of-Ease to Moseley was\r\nbuilt at the expense of Miss Anderton, of Moseley Wake Green, the\r\nconsecration taking place Sept. 22, 1874. The living is valued at £150,\r\nand is in the gift of the Vicar of Moseley, the present incumbent being\r\nthe Rev. J. Leverett, M.A. Half the 400 seats are free.\r\n\r\n_St. Asaph's_, Great Colmore Street,--the freehold of the site was given\r\nby Mr. Cregoe Colmore, and the erection of the church, which yet wants\r\nthe tower and spire, cost £5,450. The cornerstone was laid Aug. 22,\r\n1867, and the building was consecrated Dec. 8, 1868. There are 950\r\nsittings, of which 500 are free. Trustees present. The living, value\r\n£300, being now held by the Rev. R. Fletcher, M.A.\r\n\r\n_St. Augustine's_, Hagley Road, the foundation stone of which was laid\r\nOct. 14, 1867, was consecrated September 12, 1868, the first cost being\r\na little over £9,000, but a tower and spire (185 ft. high) was added in\r\n1876 at a further cost of £4,000. It is a Chapel-of-ease to Edgbaston,\r\nin the gift of the Bishop. Value £500. Held by Rev. J.C. Blissard, M.A.\r\nSeats, 650.\r\n\r\n_St. Barnabas_, Erdington.--This church, originally built in 1823, at a\r\ncost of about £6,000, with accommodation for 700 only, has lately been\r\nenlarged so as to provide 1,100 sittings (600 free)--£2,700 being\r\nexpended on the improvements. The Vicar of Aston is patron, and the\r\nliving is valued at £300. The re-opening took place June 11, 1883. Rev.\r\nH.H. Rose, M.A., has been Vicar since 1850.\r\n\r\n_St. Barnabas'_, Ryland Street.--First stone laid Aug. 1, 1859;\r\nconsecrated Oct. 24, 1860; renovated in 1882. Has sittings for 1,050, of\r\nwhich 650 are free. Value £300, in the gift of trustees. Present Vicar,\r\nRev. P. Waller. Services also at Mission Room, Sheepcote Street.\r\n\r\n_St. Bartholomew's_.--The building of this church was commenced in 1749,\r\nthe site being given by William Jennens, Esq., and £1,000 towards the\r\nbuilding by his mother, Mrs. Anne Jennens. Lord Fielding also gave £120\r\nto pay for an altar-piece, which is greatly admired. Surrounded for very\r\nmany years by a barren-looking graveyard, the huge brick-built edifice\r\nwas very unsightly, and being close to the Park Street burial ground it\r\nwas nicknamed \"the paupers' church.\" Since the laying out of the\r\ngrounds, however, it has much improved in appearance. The Rector of St.\r\nMartin's presents, and the living is valued at £280. There are 1,800\r\nsittings, 1,000 being free.

Boydon, B.A. Week night services also\r\nat Mission Room, Macdonald Street.\r\n\r\n_St. Edburgh's_,--The parish church of Yardley, dating from Henry VII.'s\r\nreign, contains monuments relating to several of our ancient families of\r\nlocal note. The living is a vicarage (value £525) in the gift of the\r\nRev. J. Dodd, the present vicar being the Rev. F.S. Dodd, M.A. There is\r\naccommodation for 600, a third of the seats being free.\r\n\r\n_St. Gabriel's_, Pickford Street.--The first stone was laid in\r\nSeptember, 1867, and the consecration took place Jan. 5, 1869. The\r\nsittings number 600, most being free. The living (value £300) is in the\r\ngift of the Bishop, and is held by the Rev. J.T. Tanse, vicar. A mission\r\nroom at the west end of the church was opened Dec. 14, 1878. It is\r\n105ft. long by 25ft. wide, and will seat 800. The cost was about £3,500,\r\nand it is said the Vicar and his friends saved £2,500 by building the\r\nrooms themselves.\r\n\r\n_St. George's_.--When first built, there were so few houses near Great\r\nHampton Row and Tower Street, that this church was known as \"St.\r\nGeorge's in the Fields,\" and the site for church and churchyard (3,965\r\nsquare yards) was purchased for £200. The foundation stone was laid\r\nApril 19, 1820, and the consecration took place July 30, 1822. The tower\r\nis 114ft. high, and the first cost of the building was £12,735.\r\nRenovated in 1870, the church has latterly been enlarged, the first\r\nstone of a new chancel being placed in position (June, 1882) by the\r\nBishop of Ballarat, formerly rector of the parish. This and other\r\nadditions has added £2,350 to the original cost of the church, which\r\nprovides accommodation for 2,150, all but 700 being free seats. The\r\nliving (value £500) is in the gift of trustees, and the present Rector\r\nis the Rev. J.G. Dixon, M.A. The church was re-opened March 13, 1883,\r\nand services are also conducted in New Summer Street and in Smith Street\r\nSchoolrooms.\r\n\r\n_St. George's_, Edgbaston.--First stone laid Aug. 17, 1836; consecrated\r\nNov. 28, 1838. Cost £6,000. Perpetual curacy (value £300), in the gift\r\nof Lord Calthorpe. 1,000 sittings, of which one-third are free, but it\r\nis proposed to considerably enlarge the building, and possibly as much\r\nas £8,000 will be spent thereon, with proportionate accommodation.\r\n\r\n_St. James's_, Ashted.--Originally the residence of Dr. Ash, this\r\nbuilding was remodelled and opened as a place of worship, Oct. 9, 1791.\r\nAs Ashted Chapel it was sold by auction, May 3, 1796. Afterwards, being\r\ndedicated to St. James, it was consecrated, the ceremony taking place\r\nAug. 7, 1807. The living (value £300) is in the gift of trustees, the\r\npresent vicar being the Rev. H.C. Phelps, M.A. Of the 1,350 sittings,\r\n450 are free, there being also a mission room in Vauxhall Road.\r\n\r\n_St. James's_, Aston.--The mission room, in Tower Road, in connection\r\nwith Aston Church, is known as St. James's Church Room, it being\r\nintended to erect a church on an adjoining site.\r\n\r\n_St. James's_, Edgbaston, which cost about £6,000, was consecrated June\r\n1, 1852, and has 900 sittings, one-fourth being free. Perpetual curacy\r\n(value £230) in the gift of Lord Calthorpe. The 25th anniversary of the\r\nincumbency of the Rev. P. Browne, M.A., was celebrated June 7, 1877, by\r\nthe inauguration of a new organ, subscribed for by the congregation.\r\n\r\n_St. James's_, Handsworth, was built in 1849, and has 800 sittings, of\r\nwhich one half are free. The living (value £300) is in the gift of the\r\nRector of Handsworth, and the present vicar is the Rev. H.L. Randall,\r\nB.A.\r\n\r\n_St. John's_, Deritend.--The \"Chapel of St. John's,\" was commenced in\r\n1375; it was licensed in 1381 by the monks of Tickford Priory, who\r\nappointed the Vicars of Aston, in which parish Deritend then was; it was\r\nrepaired in 1677, and rebuilt in 1735. The tower was added in 1762, and\r\nclock and bells put in in 1776. This is believed to have been the first\r\nchurch in which the teachings of Wycliffe and the Reformers were\r\nallowed, the grant given to the inhabitants leaving in their hands the\r\nsole choice of the minister. This rite was last exercised June 15, 1870,\r\nwhen the present chaplain, the Rev. W.C. Badger, was elected by 3,800\r\nvotes, against 2,299 given for a rival candidate. There is accommodation\r\nfor 850, of which 250 seats are free. It is related that when the\r\npresent edifice was erected (1735) a part of the small burial ground was\r\ntaken into the site, and that pew-rents are only charged for the\r\nsittings covering the ground so occupied. The living is valued at £400.\r\nFor a most interesting account of this church reference should be made\r\nto \"Memorials of Old Birmingham\" by the late Mr. Toulmin Smith. Services\r\nalso take place at the School Room, and at the Mission Room, Darwin\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n_St. John's_, Ladywood, built at a cost of £6,000, the site being given\r\nby the Governors of the Free Grammar School, and the stone for building\r\nby Lord Calthorpe, was consecrated March 15, 1854. In 1881, a further\r\nsum of £2,350 was expended in the erection of a new chancel and other\r\nadditions. The Rector of St. Martin's is the patron of the living\r\n(valued at £330), and the present Vicar is the Rev. J.L. Porter, M.A.\r\nThe sittings number 1,250, of which 550 are free. Services are also\r\nconducted at the Mission Room, Coplow Street, and on Sunday evenings in\r\nOsler Street Board School.\r\n\r\n_St. John's_, Perry Barr, was built, endowed, and a fund left for future\r\nrepairs, by \"Squire Gough,\" of Perry Hall, the cost being about £10,000.\r\nThe consecration took place Aug. 6, 1833, and was a day of great\r\nrejoicing in the neighbourhood. In 1868 the church was supplied with a\r\npeal of eight bells in memory of the late Lord Calthorpe. The living\r\n(valued at £500) is in the gift of the Hon. A.C.G. Calthorpe.\r\n\r\n_St. John the Baptist_, East Harborne, which cost rather more than\r\n£4,000, was consecrated November 12, 1858. It has sittings for 900, of\r\nwhich number one half are free. Living valued at £115; patron Rev. T.\r\nSmith, M.A.; vicar, Rev. P. Smith, B.A.\r\n\r\n_St. John the Evangelist_, Stratford Road.--A temporary iron church\r\nwhich was opened April 2, 1878, at a cost of £680. A Mission Room, in\r\nWarwick Road, Greet, is in connection with above.\r\n\r\n_St. Jude's_, Tonk Street, which was consecrated July 26, 1851, has\r\n1,300 sittings, of which 1,000 are free. In the summer of 1879, the\r\nbuilding underwent a much-needed course of renovation, and has been\r\nstill further improved by the destruction of the many \"rookeries\"\r\nformerly surrounding it. The patronage is vested in the Crown and Bishop\r\nalternately, but the living is one of the poorest in the town, only\r\n£150.\r\n\r\n_St. Lawrence's_, Dartmouth Street.--First stone laid June 18, 1867;\r\nconsecrated June 25, 1868; has sittings for 745, 400 being free. The\r\nBishop is the patron, and the living (value £320) is now held by the\r\nRev. J.F.M. Whish, B.A.\r\n\r\n_St. Luke's_, Bristol Road.--The foundation stone of this old\r\nNorman-looking church was laid July 29, 1841, but it might have been in\r\n1481 to judge by its present appearance, the unfortunate choice of the\r\nstone used in the building giving quite an ancient look. It cost £3,700,\r\nand was consecrated Sept. 28, 1842. There are 300 free seats out of 800.\r\nThe trustees are patrons, and the living (value £430) is held by the\r\nRev. W.B. Wilkinson, M.A., vicar.\r\n\r\n_St. Margaret's_, Ledsam Street.--The cost of this church was about\r\n£5,000; the first stone was laid May 16, 1874; the consecration took\r\nplace Oct. 2, 1875, and it finds seating for 800, all free. The Bishop\r\nis the patron of the living (a perpetual curacy value £300), and it is\r\nnow held by the Rev. H.A. Nash. The schoolroom in Rann Street is\r\nlicensed in connection with St. Margaret's.\r\n\r\n_St. Margaret's_, Olton, was consecrated Dec. 14, 1880, the first stone\r\nhaving been laid Oct. 30, 1879.\r\n\r\n_St. Margaret's_, Ward End, built on the site, and partly with the ruins\r\nof an ancient church, was opened in 1836, and gives accommodation for\r\n320 persons, 175 seats being free. The living, value £150, is in the\r\ngift of trustees, and is held by the Rev. C. Heath, M.A., Vicar.\r\n\r\n_St. Mark's_, King Edward's Road.--First stone laid March 31, 1840;\r\nconsecrated July 30, 1841. Cost about £4,000, and accommodates 1,000,\r\nabout a third of the seats being free. A vicarage, value £300; patrons,\r\ntrustees; vicar, Rev. R.L.G. Pidcock, M.A.\r\n\r\n_St. Martins_.--There is no authentic date by which we can arrive at the\r\nprobable period of the first building of a Church for the parish of\r\nBirmingham. Hutton \"supposed\" there was a church here about A.D. 750,\r\nbut no other writer has ventured to go past 1280, and as there is no\r\nmention in the Domesday Book of any such building, the last supposition\r\nis probably nearest the mark. The founder of the church was most likely\r\nSir William de Bermingham, of whom there is still a monumental effigy\r\nexisting, and the first endowment would naturally come from the same\r\nfamily, who, before the erection of such church, would have their own\r\nchapel at the Manor House. Other endowments there were from the\r\nClodshales, notably that of Walter de Clodshale, in 1330, who left\r\ntwenty acres of land, four messuages, and 18d. annual rent, for one\r\npriest to say mass daily for the souls of the said Walter, his wife,\r\nAgnes, and their ancestors; in 1347, Richard de Clodshale gave ten acres\r\nof land, five messuages, and 10s. yearly for another priest to say mass\r\nfor him and his wife, and his father and mother, \"and all the faithful\r\ndeparted\"; in 1428, Richard, grandson of the last-named, left 20s. by\r\nhis will, and bequeathed his body \"to be buried in his own chapel,\"\r\n\"within the Parish Church of Bermyngeham.\" Besides the Clodshale\r\nChantry, there was that of the Guild of the Holy Cross, but when Henry\r\nVIII. laid violent hands on all ecclesiastical property (1535) that\r\nbelonged to the Church of St. Martin was valued at no move than £10 1s.\r\nFrom the few fragments that were found when the present building was\r\nerected, and from Dugdale's descriptions that has come down to us, there\r\ncan be little doubt that the church was richly ornamented with monuments\r\nand paintings, coloured windows and encaustic tiles, though its income\r\nfrom property would appear to have been meagre enough. Students of\r\nhistory will readily understand how the fine old place came gradually to\r\nbe but little better than a huge barn, the inside walls whitewashed as\r\nwas the wont, the monuments mutilated and pushed into corners, the font\r\nshoved out of sight, and the stained glass windows demolished. Outside,\r\nthe walls and even the tower were \"cased in brick\" by the churchwardens\r\n(1690), who nevertheless thought they were doing the right thing, as\r\namong the records of the lost Staunton Collection there was one, dated\r\n1711, of \"Monys expended in public charitys by ye inhabitants of\r\nBirmingham, wth in 19 years last past,\" viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  In casing, repairing, &c., ye Old Church             £1919 01  9-1/2\r\n\r\n  Adding to ye Communion Plate of ye said Church\r\n  275 ounces of new silver                                80 16 06\r\n\r\n  Repairing ye high ways leading to ye town\r\n  wth in these 9 years                                   898 00 01\r\n\r\n  Subscribed by ye inhabitants towards erecting\r\n  a New Church, now consecrated, and Parsonage house    2234 13 11\r\n                                                       ------------\r\n                        In all                         £5132 12  3-12\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the matter of architectural taste the ideas of the church wardens\r\nseem curiously mixed, for while disfiguring the old church they\r\nevidently did their best to secure the erection of the splendid new\r\nchurch of St. Philip's, as among other entries there were several like\r\nthese:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"28pds. 2s. wch Mr. Jno. Holte has collected in Oxford towards\r\n  building ye New Church.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Revd. £30 from Sir Charles Holte, Baronet, for the use of the Com.e\r\n  of the New Church.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time to time other alterations were made, such as new roofing,\r\nshutting up the clerestory windows, piercing the walls of the chancel\r\nand the body of the church for fresh windows attaching a vestry, &c. The\r\nchurchyard was partly surrounded by houses, and in 1781 \"iron\r\npallisadoes\" were affixed to the wall. In this year also 33ft. of the\r\nspire was taken down and rebuilt. In 1807 the churchyard was enlarged by\r\nthe purchase of five tenements fronting Spiceal Street, belonging to the\r\nGovernors of the Free Grammar School, for £423, and the Commissioners\r\nhaving cleared the Bull Ring of the many erections formerly existing\r\nthere the old church in its hideous brick dress was fully exposed to\r\nview. Noble and handsome places of worship were erected in other parts\r\nof the town, but the old mother church was left in all its shabbiness\r\nuntil it became almost unsafe to hold services therein at all. The\r\nbitter feelings engendered by the old church-rate wars had doubtless\r\nmuch to do with this neglect of the \"parish\" church, but it was not\r\nexactly creditable to the Birmingham men of '49, when attention was\r\ndrawn to the dangerous condition of the spire, and a general restoration\r\nwas proposed, that what one gentleman has been pleased to call \"the lack\r\nof public interest\" should be made so manifest that not even enough\r\ncould be got to rebuild the tower. Another attempt was made in 1853, and\r\non April 25th, 1854, the work of restoring the tower and rebuilding the\r\nspire, at a cost of £6,000, was commenced. The old brick casing was\r\nreplaced by stone, and, on completion of the tower, the first stone of\r\nthe new spire was laid June 20, 1855, the \"topping\" being successfully\r\naccomplished November 22nd following. The height of the present spire\r\nfrom the ground to the top of the stone-work is 185ft. 10 1/2in., the\r\ntower being 69ft. 6in., and the spire itself 116ft. 4 1/2in., the vane\r\nbeing an additional 18ft. 6in. The old spire was about 3in. lower than\r\nthe present new one, though it looked higher on account of its more\r\nbeautiful form and its thinner top only surmounted by the weathercock,\r\nnow to be seen at Aston Hall, The clock and chimes were renewed at a\r\ncost of £200 in 1858; the tunes played being \"God save the Queen\" [Her\r\nMajesty visited Birmingham that year], \"Rule Britannia,\" \"Blue Bells of\r\nScotland,\" \"Life let us cherish,\" the \"Easter Hymn,\" and two other\r\nhymns. Twenty years after (in 1878) after a very long period (nine\r\nyears) of inaction, the charming apparatus was again put in order, the\r\nchimes being the same as before, with the exception of \"Auld lang syne,\"\r\nwhich is substituted for \"God save the Queen,\" in consequence of the\r\nlatter not giving satisfaction since the bells have been repaired [vide\r\n\"_Mail_\"]. The clock dial is 9ft. 6in. in diameter. The original bells\r\nin the steeple were doubtless melted in the troublesome days of the\r\nCommonwealth, or perhaps, removed when Bluff Hal sequestered the\r\nChurch's property, as a new set of six (total weight 53cwt. 1qr. 15lbs.)\r\nwere hung in 1682. During the last century these were recast, and\r\naddition made to the peal, which now consists of twelve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Treble, cast in  1772, weight not noted.\r\n  Second,     \"    1771,      ditto.\r\n  Third,      \"    1758, weighing     6   2   16\r\n  Fourth,     \"    1758,     \"        6   3   27\r\n  Fifth,      \"    1758,     \"        8   0   20\r\n  Sixth,      \"    1769,     \"        8   2   12\r\n  Seventh     \"    1768,     \"        9   3   12\r\n  Eighth,     \"    1758,     \"       11   3    6\r\n  Ninth,      \"    1758,     \"       15   1   17\r\n  Tenth,      \"    1758,     \"       17   3    2\r\n  Eleventh    \"    1769,     \"       27   3   16\r\n  Tenor,      \"    1768,     \"       35   0    8\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ninth bell was recast in 1790; fourth and fifth have also been\r\nrecast, by Blews and Son, in 1870. In the metal of the tenor several\r\ncoins are visible, one being a Spanish dollar of 1742. The following\r\nlines appear on some of the bells;--\r\n\r\n\r\n  On Seventh:--\"You singers all that prize your health and happiness, be\r\n  sober, merry and wise and you will the same possess.\"\r\n\r\n  On Eighth.--\"To honour both of God and King, our voices shall in\r\n  concert ring.\"\r\n\r\n  On Tenth.--\"Our voices shall with joyful sound make, hills and valleys\r\n  echo round.\"\r\n\r\n  On Tenor.--\"Let your ceaseless changes raise to our Great Maker still\r\n  new praise.\"\r\n\r\nThe handsome appearance of the tower and spire, after restoration,\r\ncontrasted so strongly with the \"dowdy\" appearance of the remainder of\r\nthe church, that it was little wonder a more determined effort should be\r\nmade for a general building, and this time (1872) the appeal was no\r\nlonger in vain. Large donations were given by friends as well as by many\r\noutside the pale of the Church, and Dr. Wilkinson, the Rector, soon\r\nfound himself in a position to proceed with the work. The last sermon in\r\nthe old church was preached by Canon Miller, the former Rector, Oct. 27,\r\n1872, and the old brick barn gave place to an ecclesiastical structure\r\nof which the town may be proud, noble in proportions, and more than\r\nequal in its Gothic beauty to the original edifice of the Lords de\r\nBermingham, whose sculptured monuments have at length found a secure\r\nresting-place in the chancel of the new St. Martin's. From east to west\r\nthe length of the church is a little over 155ft., including the chancel,\r\nthe arch of which rises to 60ft.; the width, including nave (25ft.) and\r\nnorth and south aisles, is 67ft.; at the transepts the measure from\r\nnorth to south gives 104ft. width. The consecration and re-opening took\r\nplace July 20, 1875, when the church, which will accommodate 2,200 (400\r\nseats are free) was thronged. Several stained windows have been put in,\r\nthe organ has been enlarged, and much done in the way of decoration\r\nsince the re-building, the total cost being nearly £25,000. The living\r\n(£1,048 nett value) is in the gift of trustees, and has been held since\r\n1866 by the Rev. W. Wilkinson, D.D., Hon. Canon of Worcester, Rural\r\nDean, and Surrogate. The burial ground was closed Dec. 9, 1848.\r\n\r\n_St. Mary's_, Acock's Green, was opened Oct. 17, 1866. The cost of\r\nerection was £4,750, but it was enlarged in 1882, at a further cost of\r\n£3,000. There are 720 sittings, 420 being free. The nett value of the\r\nliving, in the gift of trustees, is £147, and the present vicar is the\r\nRev. F.T. Swinburn, D.D.\r\n\r\n_St. Mary's_, Aston Brook, was opened Dec. 10, 1863. It seats 750 (half\r\nfree), and cost £4,000; was the gift of Josiah Robins, Esq., and family.\r\nPerpetual curacy, value £300. The site of the parsonage (built in 1877,\r\nat a cost of £2,300), was the gift of Miss Robins. Present incumbent,\r\nRev. F. Smith, M.A.\r\n\r\n_St. Mary's_, Moseley.--The original date of erection is uncertain, but\r\nthere are records to the effect that the tower was an addition made in\r\nHenry VIII.'s reign, and there was doubtless a church here long prior to\r\n1500. The chancel is a modern addition of 1873; the bells were re-cast\r\nabout same time, the commemorative peal being rung June 9, 1874; and on\r\nJune 8, 1878, the churchyard was enlarged by the taking in of 4,500\r\nsquare yards of adjoining land. The living, of which the Vicar of\r\nBromsgrove is the patron, is worth £280, and is now held by the Rev. W.\r\nH. Colmore, M.A. Of the 500 sittings 150 are free.\r\n\r\n_St. Mary's_, Selly Oak, was consecrated September 12, 1861, having been\r\nerected chiefly at the expense of G.R. Elkington and J.F.

The site for the\r\nchurch (long called the \"New Church\") and churchyard, as near as\r\npossible four acres, was given by Mrs. Phillips, which accounts for the\r\nSaint's name chosen. George I. gave £600 towards the building fund, on\r\nthe application of Sir Richard Gough, whose crest of a boar's head was\r\nput over the church, and there is now, in the form of a vane, as an\r\nacknowledgment of his kindness. Other subscriptions came in freely, and\r\nthe £5,000, first estimated cost, was soon raised. [See \"_St.\r\nMartins_\"]. The building was commenced in 1711, and consecrated on\r\nOctober 4th, 1715. but the church was not completed until 1719. The\r\nchurch was re-pewed in 1850, great part restored in 1859-60, and\r\nconsiderably enlarged in 1883-84.

Halstead, Rector and\r\nSurrogate.\r\n\r\n_St. Thomas-in-the-Moors_, Cox Street, Balsall Heath.--The church was\r\ncommenced to be built, at the expense of the late William Sands Cox,\r\nEsq., in the year 1868, but on account of some quibble, legal or\r\necclesiastical, the building was stopped when three parts finished. By\r\nhis will Mr. Cox directed it to be completed, and left a small\r\nendowment. This was added to by friends, and the consecration ceremony\r\ntook place Aug. 14, 1883. The church will accommodate about 600 persons.\r\n\r\n_St. Thomas the Martyr_.--Of this church, otherwise called the \"Free\r\nChapel,\" which was richly endowed in 1350 (See \"Memorials of Old\r\nBirmingham\" by Toulmin Smith), and to which the Commissioners of Henry\r\nVIII., in 1545, said the inhabitants did \"muche resorte,\" there is not\r\none stone left, and its very site is not known.\r\n\r\n_Stirchley Street_ School-Church was erected in 1863, at a cost of\r\n£1,200, and is used on Sunday and occasional weekday evenings.\r\n\r\n~Places Of Worship.~--_Dissenters'_.--A hundred years ago the places of\r\nworship in Birmingham and its neighbourhood, other than the parish\r\nchurches, could have been counted on one's fingers, and even so late as\r\n1841 not more than four dozen were found by the census enumerators in a\r\nradius of some miles from the Bull Ring. At the present time\r\nconventicles and tabernacles, Bethels and Bethesdas, Mission Halls and\r\nMeeting Rooms, are so numerous that there is hardly a street away from\r\nthe centre of the town but has one or more such buildings. To give the\r\nhistory of half the meeting-places of the hundred-and-one different\r\ndenominational bodies among us would fill a book, but notes of the\r\nprincipal Dissenting places of worship are annexed.\r\n\r\n_Antinomians_.--In 1810 the members of this sect had a chapel in\r\nBartholomew Street, which was swept away by the L. and N.W. Railway Co.,\r\nwhen extending their line to New Street.\r\n\r\n_Baptists_.--Prior to 1737, the \"Particular Baptists\" do not appear to\r\nhave had any place of worship of their own in this town, what few of\r\nthem there were travelling backwards and forwards every Sunday to\r\nBromsgrove. The first home they acquired here was a little room in a\r\nsmall yard at the back of 38, High Street (now covered by the Market\r\nHall), which was opened Aug. 24, 1737. In March of the following year a\r\nfriend left the Particulars a sum of money towards erecting a\r\nmeeting-house of their own, and this being added to a few subscriptions\r\nfrom the Coventry Particulars, led to the purchase of a little bit of\r\nthe Cherry Orchard, for which £13 was paid. Hereon a small chapel was\r\nput up, with some cottages in front, the rent of which helped to pay\r\nchapel expenses, and these cottages formed part of Cannon Street; the\r\nland at the back being reserved for a graveyard. The opening of the new\r\nchapel gave occasion for attack; and the minister of the New Meeting,\r\nMr. Bowen, an advocate of religious freedom, charged the Baptists\r\n(particular though they were) with reviving old Calvinistic doctrines\r\nand spreading Antinomianism and other errors in Birmingham; with the\r\nguileless innocence peculiar to polemical scribes, past and present. Mr.\r\nDissenting minister Bowen tried to do his friends in the Bull Ring a\r\ngood turn by issuing his papers as from \"A Consistent Churchman.\" In\r\n1763 the chapel was enlarged, and at the same time a little more land\r\nwas added to the graveyard. In 1780 a further enlargement became\r\nnecessary, which sufficed until 1805, when the original buildings,\r\nincluding the cottages next the street, were taken down to make way for\r\nthe chapel so long known by the present inhabitants. During the period\r\nof demolition and re-erection the Cannon Street congregation were\r\naccommodated at Carr's Lane, Mr. T. Morgan and Mr. John Angell James\r\neach occupying the pulpit alternately. The new chapel was opened July\r\n16, 1806, and provided seats for 900, a large pew in the gallery above\r\nthe clock being allotted to the \"string band,\" which was not replaced by\r\nan organ until 1859. In August, 1876, the Corporation purchased the site\r\nof the chapel, the graveyard, and the adjoining houses, in all about\r\n1,000 square yards in extent, for the sum of £26,500, the last Sunday\r\nservice being held on October 5, 1879. The remains of departed ministers\r\nand past members of the congregation interred in the burial-yard and\r\nunder the chapel were carefully removed, mostly to Witton Cemetery. The\r\nexact number of interments that had taken place in Cannon Street has\r\nnever been stated, but they were considerably over 200; in one vault\r\nalone more than forty lead coffins being found. The site is now covered\r\nby the Central Arcade. Almost as old as Cannon Street Chapel was the one\r\nin Freeman Street, taken down in 1856, and the next in date was \"Old\r\nSalem,\" built in 1791, but demolished when the Great Western Railway was\r\nmade. In 1785 a few members left Cannon Street to form a church in\r\nNeedless Alley, but soon removed to Bond Street, under Mr. E. Edmonds,\r\nfather of the well-known George Edmonds.--In the year 1870 fifty-two\r\nmembers were \"dismissed\" to constitute a congregation at Newhall Street\r\nChapel, under the Rev. A. O'Neill.--In the same way a few began the\r\nchurch in Graham Street in 1828.--On Emancipation Day (Aug. 1, 1838),\r\nthe first stone was laid of Heneage Street Chapel, which was opened June\r\n10, 1841.--In 1845 a chapel was erected at Shirley; and on Oct. 24,\r\n1849, the Circus in Bradford Street was opened as a Baptist Chapel.\r\nSalem Chapel, Frederick Street, was opened Sept. 14, 1851.--Wycliffe\r\nChurch, Bristol Road, was commenced Nov. 8, 1859, and opened June 26,\r\n1861.--Lombard Street Chapel was started Nov. 25, 1864.--Christ Church,\r\nAston, was opened April 19, 1865.--The Chapel in Balsall Heath Road was\r\nopened in March, 1872; that in Victoria Street, Small Heath, June 24,\r\n1873; and in Great Francis Street, May 27, 1877. When the Cannon Street\r\nChapel was demolished, the trustees purchased Graham Street Chapel and\r\nschools for the sum of £14,200, other portions of the money given by the\r\nCorporation being allotted towards the erection of new chapels\r\nelsewhere. The Graham Street congregation divided, one portion erecting\r\nfor themselves the Church of the Redeemer, in Hagley Road, (opened May\r\n24, 1882), while those living on the Handsworth side built a church in\r\nHamstead Road (opened March 1, 1883), each building costing over\r\n£10,000. The first stone of the Stratford Road Church (the site of\r\nwhich, valued at £1,200, was given by Mr. W. Middlemore) was laid on the\r\n8th of June, 1878, and the building, which cost £7,600, was opened June\r\n3, 1879. Mr. Middlemore also gave the site (value £2,200) for the Hagley\r\nRoad Church, £6,000 of the Cannon Street money going to it, and £3,500\r\nto the Stratford Road Church.--The Baptists have also chapels in\r\nGuildford Street, Hope Street, Lodge Road, Longmore Street, Great King\r\nStreet, Spring Hill, Warwick Street, Yates Street, as well as at\r\nErdington, Harborne, King's Heath, Selly Oak, Quinton, &c.\r\n\r\n_Catholic Apostolic Church_, Summer Hill Terrace.--This edifice, erected\r\nin 1877, cost about £10,000, and has seats for 400.\r\n\r\n_Christian Brethren_.--Their head meeting-house is at the Central Hall,\r\nGreat Charles Street, other meetings being held in Bearwood Road,\r\nBirchfield Road, Green Lanes, King Street, (Balsall Heath), New John\r\nStreet, Wenman Street, (opened in June, 1870), and at Aston and\r\nErdington.\r\n\r\n_Christadelphians_ meet at the Temperance Hall, Temple Street.\r\n\r\n_Church of the Saviour_, Edward Street.--Built for George Dawson on his\r\nleaving the Baptists, the first turf being turned on the site July 14,\r\n1846, and the opening taking place Aug. 8, 1847.\r\n\r\n_Congregational_.--How the Independents sprang from the Presbyterians,\r\nand the Congregationalists from them, is hardly matter of local history,\r\nthough Carr's Line Chapel has sheltered them all in rotation. The first\r\nbuilding was put up in 1747-48, and, with occasional repairs lasted full\r\nfifty years, being rebuilt in 1802, when the congregation numbered\r\nnearly 900. Soon after the advent of the Rev. John Angell James, it\r\nbecame necessary to provide accommodation for at least 2,000, and in\r\n1819 the chapel was again rebuilt in the form so well known to the\r\npresent generation. The rapidity with which this was accomplished was so\r\nstartling that the record inscribed on the last late affixed to the roof\r\nis worth quoting, as well on account of its being somewhat of a novel\r\ninnovation upon the usual custom of foundation-stone memorial stone, and\r\nfirst-stone laying and fixing:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Memoranda. On the 30th day of July, 1819, the first stone of this\r\n  building was laid by the Rev. John Angell James, the minister. On the\r\n  30th day of October, in the same year, this the last slate was laid by\r\n  Henry Leneve Holland, the builder, in the presence of Stedman Thomas\r\n  Whitwell, the Architect.--_Laus Deo_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1875-76 the chapel was enlarged, refronted, and in many ways\r\nstrengthened and improved, at a cost of nearly £5,000, and it now has\r\nseats for 2,250 persons.--Ebenezer Chapel, Steelhouse Lane, which will\r\nseat 1,200, was opened Dec. 9, 1818.

Funds to build a church were gathered in\r\nsucceeding years and the present edifice was opened April 1, 1877, the\r\ncost being £1,300.\r\n\r\n_Jews_.--The Hebrew Synagogue in Blucher Street was erected in 1856, at\r\na cost of £10,000.\r\n\r\n_Methodists_.--The Primitive Methodists for some time after their first\r\nappearance here held, their meetings in the open air or in hired rooms,\r\nthe first chapel they used being that in Bordesley Street (opened March\r\n16, 1823, by the Wesleyans) which they entered upon in 1826. Other\r\nchapels they had at various times in Allison Street, Balloon Street,\r\nInge Street, &c. Gooch Street Chapel was erected by them at a cost of\r\nover £2,000 (the first stone being laid August 23, 1852) and is now\r\ntheir principal place of worship, their services being also conducted in\r\nChapels and Mission Rooms in Aston New Town, Garrison Lane, Long Acre,\r\nLord Street, Morville Street, Wells Street, Whitmore Street, The Cape,\r\nSelly Oak, Perry Barr, Sparkbrook, and Stirchley Street.--_The Methodist\r\nNew Connexion_ have chapels in Heath Street, Kyrwick's Lane, Ladywood\r\nLane, Moseley Street, and Unett Street--The first stone of a chapel for\r\nthe _Methodist New Congregational_ body was placed July 13, 1873, in\r\nIcknield Street West.--The _Methodist Reformers_ commenced to build a\r\nchapel in Bishop Street, November 15, 1852.--The _Methodist Free Church_\r\nhas places of worship in Bath Street, Cuckoo Road, Muntz Street, Rocky\r\nLane, and at Washwood Heath.\r\n\r\n_New Church_.--The denomination of professing Christians, who style\r\nthemselves the \"New Church,\" sometimes known as \"The New Jerusalem\r\nChurch,\" and more commonly as \"Swedenborgians,\" as early as 1774 had a\r\nmeeting room in Great Charles Street, from whence they removed to a\r\nlarger one in Temple Row. Here they remained until 1791, when they took\r\npossession of Zion Chapel, Newhall Street, the ceremony of consecration\r\ntaking place on the 19 of June. This event was of more than usual\r\ninterest, inasmuch as this edifice was the first ever erected in the\r\nworld for New Church worship. The rioters of 1791, who professed to\r\nsupport the National Church by demolishing the Dissenting places of\r\nworship, paid Zion Chapel a visit and threatened to burn it, but the\r\neloquence of the minister, the Rev. J. Proud, aided by a judicious\r\ndistribution of what cash he had in his pocket, prevailed over their\r\nburning desires, and they carried their torches elsewhere. On the 10th\r\nof March, 1793, however, another incendiary attempt was made to suppress\r\nthe New Church, but the fire was put out before much damage was done.\r\nWhat fire and popular enmity could not do, however, was accomplished by\r\na financial crisis, and the congregation had to leave their Zion, and\r\nput up with a less pretentious place of worship opposite the Wharf in\r\nNewhall Street. Here they remained till 1830, when they removed to\r\nSummer Lane, where a commodious church, large schools, and minister's\r\nhouse had been erected for them. In 1875 the congregation removed to\r\ntheir present location in Wretham Road, where a handsome church has been\r\nbuilt, at a cost of nearly £8,000, to accommodate 500 persons, with\r\nschools in the rear for as many children. The old chapel in Summer Lane\r\nhas been turned into a Clubhouse, and the schools attached to it made\r\nover to the School Board. The New Church's new church, like many other\r\nmodern-built places for Dissenting worship, has tower and spire, the\r\nheight being 116ft.\r\n\r\n_Presbyterians_.--It took a long time for all the nice distinctive\r\ndifferences of dissenting belief to manifest themselves before the\r\npublic got used to Unitarianism, Congregationalism, and all the other\r\nisms into which Nonconformity has divided itself. When Birmingham was as\r\na city of refuge for the many clergymen who would not accept the Act of\r\nUniformity, it was deemed right to issue unto them licenses for\r\npreaching, and before the first Baptist chapel, or the New Meeting, or\r\nthe Old Meeting, or the old Old Meeting (erected in 1689), were built,\r\nwe find (1672) that one Samuel Willis, styling himself a minister of the\r\nPresbyterian persuasion, applied for preaching licenses for the\r\nschool-house, and for the houses of John Wall, and Joseph Robinson, and\r\nSamuel Taylor, and Samuel Dooley, and John Hunt, all the same being in\r\nBirmingham; and William Fincher, another \"minister of the Presbyterian\r\npersuasion,\" asked for licenses to preach in the house of Richard\r\nYarnald, in Birmingham, his own house, and in the houses of Thomas\r\nGisboon, William Wheeley, John Pemberton, and Richard Careless, in\r\nBirmingham, and in the house of Mrs. Yarrington, on Bowdswell Heath. In\r\nBradford's map (1751) Carr's Lane chapel is put as a \"Presbiterian\r\nchapel,\" the New Meeting Street building close by being called\r\n\"Presbiterian Meeting.\" It was of this \"Presbiterian Chapel\" in Carr's\r\nLane that Hutton wrote when he said it _was_ the road to heaven, but\r\nthat its surroundings indicated a very different route. Perhaps it was\r\ndue to these surroundings that the attendants at Carr's Lane came by\r\ndegrees to be called Independents and the New Meeting Street folks\r\nUnitarians, for both after a time ceased to be known as Presbyterians.\r\nThe Scotch Church, or, as it is sometimes styled, the Presbyterian\r\nChurch of England, is not a large body in Birmingham, having but three\r\nplaces of worship. The first Presbytery held in this town was on July 6,\r\n1847; the foundation-stone of the Church in Broad Street was laid July\r\n24, 1848; the Church at Camp Hill was opened June 3, 1869; and the one\r\nin New John Street West was began July 4, 1856, and opened June 19,\r\n1857.\r\n\r\n_Salvation Army_.--The invasion of Birmingham by the soldiers of the\r\nSalvation Army was accomplished in the autumn of 1882, the General (Mr.\r\nBooth) putting in an appearance March 18, 1883. They have several\r\nrendezvous in the town, one of the principal being in Farm Street, from\r\nwhence the \"soldiers\" frequently sally out, with drums beating and\r\ncolours flying, much to their own glorification and other people's\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n_Unitarians_.--The building known for generations as the Old Meeting, is\r\nbelieved to have been the first Dissenting place of worship erected in\r\nBirmingham; and, as its first register dates from 1689, the chapel most\r\nlikely was built in the previous year. It was doubtless but a small\r\nbuilding, as in about ten years (1699) a \"Lower Meeting House\" was\r\nfounded in Meeting House Yard, nearly opposite Rea Street. The premises\r\noccupied here were gutted in the riots of 1715, and the owner promised\r\nthe mob that it should no more be used as a chapel, but when calmer he\r\nrepented and services were held until the New Meeting House in Moor\r\nStreet was opened. The rioters in 1715 partly destroyed the old Meeting\r\nand those of 1791 did so completely, as well as the New Meeting, which\r\n(began in 1730) was opened in 1732. For a time the congregations united\r\nand met at the Amphitheatre in Livery Street, the members of Old Meeting\r\ntaking possession of their re-erected chapel, October 4, 1795. New\r\nMeeting being re-opened April 22, 1802. The last-named building remained\r\nin the possession of the Unitarians until 1861, when it was sold to the\r\nRoman Catholics. The last services in Old Meeting took place March 19,\r\n1882, the chapel and graveyard, comprising an area of 2,760 square\r\nyards, being sold to the L. & N. W. R. Co., for the purpose of enlarging\r\nthe Central Station. The price paid by the Railway Company was £32,250,\r\nof which £2,000 was for the minister and £250 towards the expense of\r\nremoving to private vaults the remains of a few persons whose friends\r\nwished that course. A portion of Witton Cemetery was laid out for the\r\nreception of the remainder, where graves and vaults have been made in\r\nrelative positions to those in the old graveyard, the tombstones being\r\nsimilarly placed. A new church has been erected in Bristol Street for\r\nthe congregation, with Sunday Schools, &c., £7,000 being the sum given\r\nfor the site.--In 1839, Hurst Street Chapel was built for the Unitarian\r\nDomestic Mission. May 1, same year, the first stone was laid of the\r\nNewhall Hill Chapel, which was opened July 10, 1840.--The Church of the\r\nMessiah, Broad Street, was commenced Aug. 12, 1860, and opened Jan. 1,\r\n1862. This church, which cost £10,000 and will seat nearly 1,000 is\r\nbuilt over a canal, one of the strangest sites ever chosen for a place\r\nof worship. In connection with this church, there is a chapel in\r\nLawrence Street.\r\n\r\n_Welsh Chapels_.--The Welsh Calvinistic Methodists meet in the little\r\nchapel, bottom of Hockley Hill, and also in Granville Street, near Bath\r\nRow.--The Welsh Congregationalists (Independents) assemble at Wheeler\r\nStreet Chapel, opened May 1, 1839.\r\n\r\n_Wesleyans_.--The first Wesleyan Chapel in Birmingham was opened by John\r\nWesley, March 21, 1764, the building having been previously a theatre.\r\nCherry Street Chapel, opened July 7, 1782, was rebuilt in 1823.--\r\nBradford Street Chapel was opened in 1786, Belmont Row in 1789, and Bath\r\nStreet in 1839.--In 1825, a chapel was built in Martin Street, which was\r\nconverted into a school on the opening (Nov. 10, 1864) of the present\r\nedifice, which cost £6,200.--Newtown Row Chapel was built in 1837 and\r\nGreat Hampton Street and Unett Street Chapels in 1838, the latter being\r\nenlarged in 1844.--Branston Street Chapel was opened April 18, and\r\nMoseley Road, May 1, 1853.--The Bristol Road Chapel was opened January\r\n18, 1854, and that in King Edward's Road, January 18, 1859.--The first\r\nstones were laid for the chapels in Villa Street April 21, 1864,\r\nHandsworth Oct. 21, 1872, Selley Oak Oct. 2, 1876, Peel Street, August\r\n30, 1877, Cuckoo Road, June 10, 1878, Nechells Park Road Oct. 25, 1880,\r\nMansfield Road Feb. 19, 1883. Besides the above there are chapels in\r\nCoventry Road, Inge Street, Knutsford Street, Lichfield Road, Lord\r\nStreet, New John Street, Monument Road, and Warwick Road, as well as\r\nmission rooms in several parts of the town and suburbs. Acock's Green,\r\nErdington. Harborne, King's Heath, Northfield, Quinton, &c. have also\r\nWesleyan Chapels.--_The Wesleyan Reformers_ meet in Floodgate Street,\r\nand in Upper Trinity Street.\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous_.--Lady Huntingdon's followers opened a chapel in King\r\nStreet in 1785, and another in Peck Lane in 1842 (both sites being\r\ncleared in 1851), and a third in Gooch Street, Oct. 26th, 1851.--The\r\nbelievers in Joannah Southcote also had chosen spots wherein to pray for\r\ntheir leader, while the imposture lasted.--The celebrated Edward Irving\r\nopened Mount Zion Chapel, March 24th, 1824. \"God's Free Church,\" in Hope\r\nStreet, was \"established\" June 4th. 1854.--Zoar Chapel was the name\r\ngiven to a meeting-room in Cambridge Street, where a few\r\nundenominational Christians met between 1830 and 1840. It was afterwards\r\nused as a schoolroom in connection with Winfield's factory.--Wrottesley\r\nStreet Chapel was originally built as a Jewish Synagogue, at a cost of\r\nabout 2,000. After they left it was used for a variety of purposes,\r\nuntil acquired by William Murphy, the Anti-Catholic lecturer. It was\r\nsold by his executors, Aug. 2nd, 1877, and realised £645, less than the\r\ncost of the bricks and mortar, though the lease had 73 years to run.\r\n\r\n~Places of Worship.~--_Roman Catholics_.--From the days of Queen Mary,\r\ndown to the last years of James II.'s reign, there does not appear to\r\nhave been any regular meeting-place for the Catholic Inhabitants of\r\nBirmingham. In 1687, a church (dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen and St.\r\nFrancis) was built somewhere near the site of the present St.\r\nBartholomew's but it was destroyed in the following year, and the very\r\nfoundation-stones torn up and appropriated by Protestant plunderers.\r\n[See \"_Masshouse Lane_.\"]\r\n\r\nIt was a hundred years before the next church, St. Peter's, near Broad\r\nStreet, was erected, and the Catholic community has increased but slowly\r\nuntil the last thirty years or so. In 1848 there were only seven priests\r\nin Birmingham, and but seventy in the whole diocese. There are now\r\ntwenty-nine in this town, and about 200 in the district, the number of\r\nchurches having increased, in the same period, from 70 to 123, with 150\r\nschools and 17,000 scholars. The following are local places of\r\nworship:--\r\n\r\n_Cathedral of St. Chad_,--A chapel dedicated to St. Chad (who was about\r\nthe only saint the kingdom of Mercia could boast of), was opened in Bath\r\nStreet, Dec. 17, 1809. When His Holiness the Pope blessed his Catholic\r\nchildren hereabouts with a Bishop the insignificant chapel gave place to\r\na Cathedral, which, built after the designs of Pugin, cost no less than\r\n£60,000. The consecration was performed (July 14, 1838) by the Right\r\nRev. Doctor (afterwards Cardinal) Wiseman, the district bishop, in the\r\npresence of a large number of English noblemen and foreign\r\necclesiastical dignitaries, and with all the imposing ceremonies\r\ncustomary to Catholic celebrations of this nature. The adjoining houses\r\ndetract much from the outside appearance of this reproduction of\r\nmedieval architecture, but the magnificence of the interior decorations,\r\nthe elaborate carvings, and the costly accessories appertaining to the\r\nservices of the Romish Church more than compensate therefor. Pugin's\r\nplans have not even yet been fully carried out, the second spire, that\r\non the north tower (150ft. high), being added in 1856, the largest he\r\ndesigned still waiting completion. Five of a peal of eight bells were\r\nhung in 1848, and the remainder in 1877, the peculiar and locally-rare\r\nceremony of \"blessing the bells\" being performed by Bishop Ullathorne,\r\nMarch 22nd, 1877.\r\n\r\n_Oratory_, Hagley Road--Founded by the Fathers of the Order of St.\r\nPhilip Neri, otherwise called Oratorians. The Father Superior is the\r\nRev. Dr.J. H. Newman (born in 1801), once a clergyman of the Church of\r\nEngland, the author of the celebrated \"Tract XC.,\" now His Eminence\r\nCardinal Newman.\r\n\r\n_St. Anne's_, Alcester Street.--In 1851, some buildings and premises\r\noriginally used as a distillery were here taken on a lease by the\r\nSuperior of the Oratory, and opened in the following year as a\r\nMission-Church in connection with the Congregation of the Fathers in\r\nHagley Road. In course of time the property was purchased, along with\r\nsome adjacent land, for the sum of £4,500, and a new church has been\r\nerected, at a cost of £6,000. The foundation-stone was laid Sept. 10th,\r\n1883, and the opening ceremony took place in July, 1884, the old chapel\r\nand buildings being turned into schools for about 1,500 children.\r\n\r\n_St. Catherine of Sienna_, Horse Fair.--The first stone was laid Aug.\r\n23, 1869, and the church was opened in July following.\r\n\r\n_St. Joseph's_, Nechells, was built in 1850, in connection with the\r\nRoman Catholic Cemetery.\r\n\r\n_St. Mary's_, Hunter's Lane, was opened July 28, 1847.\r\n\r\n_St. Mary's Retreat_, Harborne, was founded by the Passionist Fathers,\r\nand opened Feb. 6, 1877.\r\n\r\n_St. Michael's_, Moor Street, was formerly the Unitarian New Meeting,\r\nbeing purchased, remodelled, and consecrated in 1861.\r\n\r\n_St. Patrick's,_ Dudley Road, was erected in 1862.\r\n\r\n_St. Peter's_, Broad Street, built in 1786, and enlarged in 1798, was\r\nthe first Catholic place of worship erected here after the sack and\r\ndemolition of the church and convent in Masshouse Lane. With a lively\r\nrecollection of the treatment dealt out to their brethren in 1688, the\r\nfounders of St. Peter's trusted as little as possible to the tender\r\nmercies of their fellow-townsmen, but protected themselves by so\r\narranging their church that nothing but blank walls should face the\r\nstreets, and with the exception of a doorway the walls remained\r\nunpierced for nearly seventy years. The church has lately been much\r\nenlarged, and the long-standing rebuke no more exists.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, there are the Convents of \"The Sisters of the\r\nHoly Child,\" in Hagley Road; \"Sisters of Notre Dame,\" in the Crescent;\r\n\"Little Sisters of the Poor,\" at Harborne; \"Our Lady of Mercy,\" at\r\nHandsworth; and others connected with St. Anne's and St. Chad's, besides\r\nchurches at Erdington, &c.\r\n\r\n~Police.~--Though the Court Leet provided for the appointment of\r\nconstables, no regular body of police or watchmen appear to have existed\r\neven a hundred years ago. In February, 1786, the magistrates employed\r\nmen to nightly patrol the streets, but it could not have been a\r\npermanent arrangement, as we read that the patrol was \"resumed\" in\r\n_October, 1793_, and later on, in March, 1801, the magistrates\r\n\"solicited\" the inhabitants' consent to a re-appointment of the\r\nnight-watch. After a time the Commissioners of the Streets kept regular\r\nwatchmen in their employ--the \"Charleys\" occasionally read of as finding\r\nsport for the \"young bloods\" of the time--but when serious work was\r\nrequired the Justices appear to have depended on their powers of\r\nswearing-in special constables. The introduction of a police force\r\nproper dates from the riotous time of 1839 [See \"_Chartism_\"], for\r\nimmediately after those troublous days Lord John Russell introduced a\r\nBill to the House of Commons granting special powers for enforcing a\r\nrate to maintain a police force here, under the command of a\r\nCommissioner to be appointed by the Government. The force thus sought to\r\nbe raised, though paid for by the people of Birmingham, were to be\r\navailable for the whole of the counties of Warwick, Worcester and\r\nStafford.\r\n\r\nCoercive measures were passed at that period even quicker than\r\nGovernment can manage to get them through now a-days, and\r\nnotwithstanding Mr. Thos. Attwood's telling Little Lord John that he was\r\n\"throwing a lighted torch into a magazine of gunpowder\" and that if he\r\npassed that Bill he would never be allowed to pass another, the Act was\r\npushed through on the 13th of August, there being a majority of thirteen\r\nin favour of his Lordship's policy of policeing the Brums into\r\npoliteness. The dreaded police force was soon organised under Mr.\r\nCommissioner Burges (who was paid the small salary of £900 a year), and\r\nbecame not only tolerated but valued. It was not till some years after,\r\nand then in the teeth of much opposition, that the Corporation succeeded\r\nin getting into their own hands the power of providing our local\r\nguardians of the peace. Mr. Inspector Stephens was the first Chief\r\nSuperintendent, and in March, 1860, his place was filled by the\r\npromotion of Mr. George Glossop. In April, 1876, the latter retired on\r\nan allowance of £400 a year, and Major Bond was chosen (June 2nd). The\r\nMajor's term of office was short as he resigned in Dec. 1881. Mr.\r\nFarndale being appointed in his stead. In May, 1852, the force consisted\r\nof 327, men and officers included. Additions have been made from time to\r\ntime, notably 50 in August, 1875, and so early in 1883, the total rank\r\nand file now being 550, equal to one officer for every 700 of\r\npopulation. February 8, 1876, the unpopular Public-house Inspectors were\r\nappointed, but two years' experience showed they were not wanted, and\r\nthey were relegated to their more useful duties of looking after thieves\r\nand pickpockets, instead of poking their noses into private business. In\r\n1868, £200 was expended in the purchase of guns, pistols, and swords for\r\nthe police and officers at the Gaol. The Watch Committee, in May, 1877,\r\nimproved the uniform by supplying the men with \"spiked\" helmets,\r\ndoubtless to please the Major, who liked to see his men look smart,\r\nthough the military appearance of the force has been greatly improved\r\nsince by the said spikes being silvered and burnished.\r\n\r\n~Political Union.~--See \"_Reform Leagues_.\"\r\n\r\n~Polling Districts.~--The sixteen wards of the borough are divided into\r\n131 polling districts.\r\n\r\n~Polytechnic.~--This was one of the many local literary, scientific, and\r\neducational institutions which have been replaced by our Midland\r\nInstitute, Free Libraries, &c. It was founded in April, and opened in\r\nOctober, 1843, and at the close of its first year there were the names\r\nof very nearly 500 members on the books, the rates of subscription being\r\n6s. per quarter for participation in all the benefits of the\r\ninstitution, including the lectures, library, classes, baths, &c. With\r\nthe \"People's Instruction Society,\" the \"Athenic Institute,\" the \"Carr's\r\nLane Brotherly Society\" (said to have been the first Mechanics'\r\nInstitution in Britain), the Polytechnic, in its day, did good work.\r\n\r\n~Poor Law and Poor Rates.~--Local history does not throw much light\r\nupon the system adopted by our early progenitors in their dealings with\r\nthe poor, but if the merciless laws were strictly carried out, the\r\nwandering beggars, at all events must have had hard lives of it. By an\r\nact passed in the reign of Henry VIII., it was ordered that vagrants\r\nshould be taken to a market town, or other convenient place and there to\r\nbe tied to the tail of a cart, naked, and beaten with whips until the\r\nbody should be bloody by reason of the punishment. Queen Elizabeth so\r\nfar mitigated the punishment that the unfortunates were only to be\r\nstripped from the waist upwards to receive their whipping, men and\r\nwomen, maids and mothers, suffering alike in the open street or\r\nmarket-place, the practice being, after so using them, to conduct them\r\nto the boundary of the parish and pass them on to the next place for\r\nanother dose, and it was not until 1791 that flogging of women was\r\nforbidden. The resident or native poor were possibly treated a little\r\nbetter, though they were made to work for their bread in every possible\r\ncase. By the new Poor Act of 1783, which authorised the erection of a\r\nWorkhouse, it was also provided that the \"Guardians of the Poor\" should\r\nform a Board consisting of 106 members, and the election of the first\r\nBoard (July 15th, 1783), seems to have been almost as exciting as a\r\nmodern election. In one sense of the word they were guardians indeed,\r\nfor they seem to have tried their inventive faculties in all ways to\r\nfind work for the inmates of the House, even to hiring them out, or\r\nsetting them to make worsted and thread. The Guardians would also seem\r\nto have long had great freedom allowed them in the spending of the\r\nrates, as we read it was not an uncommon thing for one of them if he met\r\na poor person badly off for clothes to give an order on the Workhouse\r\nfor a fresh \"rig out.\" In 1873 the Board was reduced to sixty in number\r\n(the first election taking place on the 4th of April), with the usual\r\nlocal result that a proper political balance was struck of 40 Liberals\r\nto 20 Conservatives. The Workhouse, Parish Offices, Children's Homes,\r\n&c., will be noted elsewhere. Poor law management in the borough is\r\ngreatly complicated from the fact of its comprising two different\r\nparishes, and part of a third. The Parish of Birmingham works under a\r\nspecial local Act, while Edgbaston forms part of King's Norton Union,\r\nand the Aston portion of the town belongs to the Aston Union,\r\nnecessitating three different rates and three sets of collectors, &c. If\r\na poor man in Moseley Road needs assistance he must see the relieving\r\nofficer at the Parish Offices in the centre of the town if he lives on\r\none side of Highgite Lane he must find the relieving officer at King's\r\nHeith; but if he happens to be on the other side he will have to go to\r\nGravelly Hill or Erdington. Not long ago to obtain a visit from the\r\nmedical officer for his sick wife, a man had to go backwards and\r\nforwards more than twenty miles. The earliest record we have found of\r\nthe cost of relieving the poor of the parish is of the date of 1673 in\r\nwhich year the sum of £309 was thus expended. In 1773 the amount was\r\n£6,378, but the pressure on the rates varied considerably about then, as\r\nin 1786 it required £11,132, while in 1796 the figures rose to £24,050.\r\nAccording to Hutton, out of about 8,000 houses only 3,000 were assessed\r\nto the poor rates in 1780, the inhabitants of the remaining number being\r\ntoo poor to pay them. Another note shows up the peculiar incidence of\r\ntaxation of the time, as it is said that in 1790 there were nearly 2000\r\nhouses under £5 rental and 8,000 others under £10, none of them being\r\nassessed, such small tenancies being first rated in 1792. The rates then\r\nappear to have been levied at the uniform figure of 6d. in the £ on all\r\nhouses above £6 yearly value, the ratepayers being called upon as the\r\nmoney was required--in and about 1798, the collector making his\r\nappearance sixteen or eighteen times in the course of the year. The\r\nGuardians were not so chary in the matter of out-relief as they are at\r\npresent, for in 1795 there were at one period 2,427 families\r\n(representing over 6,000 persons, old and young) receiving out-relief.\r\nWhat this system (and bad trade) led to at the close of the long war is\r\nshown in the returns for 1816-17, when 36 poor rates were levied in the\r\ntwelvemonth. By various Acts of Parliament, the Overseers have now to\r\ncollect other rates, but the proportion required for the poor is thus\r\nshown:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Rate    Amount     Paid to    Cost of In and  Other Parochial\r\nYear  in £  collected  Corporation    Out Relief      Expenditure\r\n      s.d.     £           £              £                £\r\n1851  4 0    78,796     39,573         17,824            21,399\r\n1861  3 8    85,986     36,443         34,685            14,878\r\n1871  3 2   116,268     44,293         37,104            34,871\r\n1881  4 8   193,458    107,520         42,880            48,058\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amounts paid over to the Corporation include the borough rate and\r\nthe sums required by the School Board, the Free Libraries, and the\r\nDistrict Drainage Board. In future years the poor-rate (so-called) will\r\ninclude, in addition to these, all other rates levyable by the\r\nCorporation. The poor-rates are levied half-yearly, and in 1848,1862,\r\nand 1868 they amounted to 5s. per year, the lowest during the last forty\r\nyears being 3s. in 1860; 1870, 1871, and 1872 being the next lowest, 3s.\r\n2d. per year. The number of persons receiving relief may be gathered\r\nfrom the following figures:--\r\n\r\n\r\n           Highest       Lowest\r\n  Year.   No. daily    No. daily\r\n  1876      7,687       7,058\r\n  1877      8,240       7,377\r\n  1878      8,877       7,242\r\n  1879     14,651       8,829\r\n  1880     13,195       7,598\r\n  1881     11,064       7,188\r\n  1882      9,658       7,462\r\n  1883      8,347       7,630\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long ago it was said that among the inmates of the Workhouse were\r\nseveral women of 10 to 45 who had spent all their lives there, not even\r\nknowing their way into the town.\r\n\r\n~Population.~--Hutton \"calculated\" that about the year 750 there would\r\nbe 3,000 inhabitants residing in and close to Birmingham. Unless a very\r\nrapid thinning process was going on after that date he must have been a\r\nlong way out of his reckoning, for the Domesday Book gives but 63\r\nresidents in 1085 for Birmingham, Aston, and Edgbaston. In 1555 we find\r\nthat 37 baptisms, 15 weddings, and 27 deaths were registered at St.\r\nMartin's, the houses not being more than 700, nor the occupiers over\r\n3,500 in number. In 1650, it is said, there were 15 streets, about 900\r\nhouses, and 5,472 inhabitants. If the writer who made that calculation\r\nwas correct, the next 80 years must have been \"days of progress\" indeed,\r\nfor in 1700 the town is said to have included 28 streets, about 100\r\ncourts and alleys, 2,504 houses, one church, one chapel, and two\r\nmeeting-houses, with 15,032 inhabitants. In 1731 there were 55 streets,\r\nabout 150 courts and alleys, 3,719 houses, two churches, one chapel,\r\nfour Dissenting meeting-houses, and 23,286 inhabitants.

That our\r\ntown was not one of the last to be provided with mails is proved by\r\nRobert Girdler, a resident of Edgbaston Street in 1652, being appointed\r\nthe Government postmaster. Where the earlier post offices were situated\r\nis uncertain, but one was opened in New Street Oct. 11, 1783, and it is\r\ngenerally believed to have been the same that existed for so many years\r\nat the corner of Bennett's Hill. As late as 1820 there was no Bennett's\r\nHill, for at that time the site opposite the Theatre was occupied (on\r\nthe side nearest to Temple Street) by a rickyard, with accommodation for\r\nthe mailcoaches and stabling for horses. Next to this yard was the\r\nresidence of Mr. Gottwaltz, the postmaster, the entrance doorway being\r\nat first the only accommodation allowed to the public, and if more than\r\nfour persons attended at one time the others had to stand in the street.\r\nWhen Bennett's Hill was laid out, the post office was slightly altered,\r\nso as to give a covered approach on that side to the letterbox and\r\nwindow, the mailcoaches being provided and horsed by the hotelkeepers to\r\nwhom the conveyance of the mails was entrusted, the mail guards, or\r\nmail-postmen, remaining Government officials. The next office was opened\r\nOct. 10, 1842, on premises very nearly opposite, and which at one period\r\nformed part of the new Royal Hotel. The site is now covered by the\r\nColonnade, the present convenient, but not beautiful, Central Post\r\nOffice, in Paradise Street, being opened Sep. 28, 1873. There are 65\r\ntown receiving offices (52 of which are Money Order Offices and Savings'\r\nBanks and 13 Telegraph Stations), and 103 pillar and wall letter-boxes.\r\nOf sub-offices in the surrounding districts there are 64, of which more\r\nthan half are Money Order Offices or Telegraph Offices. For the conduct\r\nof the Central Office, Mr. S. Walliker, the postmaster, has a staff\r\nnumbering nearly 300, of whom about 250 are letter carriers and sorters.\r\nThe Central Postal Telegraph Office, in Cannon Street, is open day and\r\nnight, and the Central Post Office, in Paradise Street, from 7 a.m. to\r\n10 p.m. On Sunday the latter office is open only from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m.,\r\nbut letters are dispatched by the night mails as on other days. The Head\r\nParcels Post Office is in Hill Street, on the basement floor of the\r\nCentral Post Office, from which there are four collections and\r\ndeliveries daily.\r\n\r\n~Postal Notes.~--In 1748 letters were conveyed from here by post on six\r\ndays a week instead of three as previously. To help pay the extra\r\nexpense it was enacted that any person sending letters by private hands\r\nshould be liable to a fine of £5 for every letter.--In 1772 a letter\r\nsent by \"express\" post was charged at the rate of 3d. per mile, with a\r\n6d. fee for each stage and 2s. 6d. for the sending off.--Mails for the\r\nContinent were made up fortnightly, and once a month for North America.\r\n--In 1780, when James Watt was at Truro and Boulton at Birmingham, it\r\ntook thirteen days for the one to write to and get an answer from the\r\nother, and on one occasion a single letter was eleven days on the road.\r\n--A local \"penny post\" was commenced September 4, 1793, but there was\r\nonly one delivery per day and the distance was confined to one mile from\r\nthe office.--The postage on letters for London was reduced to 7d.,\r\nDecember 1, 1796, but (and for many years after) if more than one piece\r\nof paper was used the cost was doubled.--In 1814 the postage of a letter\r\nfrom here to Warwick was 7d.--The system of \"franking\" letters was\r\nabolished in 1839. This was a peculiar privilege which noblemen, Members\r\nof Parliament, and high dignitaries possessed of free postage for all\r\ntheir correspondence, and very strange use they made of the privilege\r\nsometimes, one instance being the case of two maidservants going as\r\nlaundresses to an Ambassador who were thus \"franked\" to their\r\ndestination. This privilege cost the Post office about £100,000 a year.\r\n--The penny postage system of Rowland Hill came into operation January\r\n10th, 1840.--In 1841-2 there were only two deliveries per day in the\r\ncentre of the town, and but one outside the mile circle, an extra penny\r\nbeing charged on letters posted in town for delivery in the outer\r\ndistricts.--The collection of a million postage stamps for the Queen's\r\nHospital closed Sep. 5, 1859.--Halfpenny stamps for newspapers were\r\nfirst used in 1870.--The telegraphs were taken to by the Post Office in\r\n1876, the first soirée in celebration thereof being held at Bristol\r\nStreet Board School, Jan. 29, 1877.--The Inland Parcels Post came into\r\noperation on August 1, 1883, the number of parcels passing through our\r\nlocal office being about 4,000 the first day, such trifles as beehives,\r\numbrellas, shoes, scythes, baskets of strawberries, &c., &c, being among\r\nthem. The number of valentines posted in Birmingham on Cupid's Day of\r\n1844 was estimated at 125,000 (the majority for local delivery), being\r\nabout 20,000 more than in the previous year.\r\n\r\n~Power.~--That the letting of mill-power would be a great advantage to\r\nhundreds of the small masters whose infinitude of productions added so\r\nenormously to the aggregate of our local trade was soon \"twigged\" by the\r\nearly owners of steam engines. The first engine to have extra shafting\r\nattached for this purpose was that made by Newcomen for a Mr. Twigg in\r\nWater Street (the premises are covered by Muntz's metal works now), who,\r\nin 1760, advertised that he had \"power to let.\"\r\n\r\n~Presentations.~--No local antiquarian has yet given us note of the\r\nfirst public presentation made by the inhabitants of this town, though\r\nto the men they have delighted to honour they have never been backward\r\nwith such flattering and pleasing tokens of goodwill. Some presentations\r\nhave been rather curious, such as gold-plated buttons and ornate shoe\r\nbuckles to members of the Royal Family in hopes that the patronage of\r\nthose individuals would lead to changes in the fashion of dress, and so\r\ninfluence local trade. The gift of a sword to Lord Nelson, considering\r\nthat the said sword had been presented previously to a volunteer\r\nofficer, was also of this nature. The Dissenters of the town gave £100\r\nto the three troops of Light Horse who first arrived to quell the riots\r\nin 1791, and a similar sum was voted at a town's meeting; each officer\r\nbeing presented with a handsome sword. Trade should have been good at\r\nthe time, for it is further recorded that each magistrate received a\r\npiece of plate valued at one hundred guineas.--Since that date there\r\nhave been hundreds of presentations, of greater or lesser value, made to\r\ndoctors and divines, soldiers and sailors, theatricals and concert-hall\r\nmen, lawyers and prizefighters, with not a few to popular politicians\r\nand leading literary men &c. Lord Brougham (then plain Mr.) being the\r\nrecipient at one time (July 7, 1812); James Day, of the Concert Hall, at\r\nanother (0ct. 1,1878); the \"Tipton Slasher\" was thus honoured early in\r\n1865, while the Hon. and Very Rev. Grantham Yorke, D.D., was \"gifted\" at\r\nthe latter end of 1875. Among the presentations of later date have been\r\nthose to Dr. Bell Fletcher, Mr. Gamgee, Mr. W.P. Goodall, and other\r\nmedical gentlemen; to Canon O'Sullivan, the late Rev. J.C. Barratt, and\r\nother clergymen; to Mr. Edwin Smith, secretary of Midland Institute; to\r\nMr. Schnadhorst of the Liberal Association; to Mr. Jesse Collings, for\r\nhaving upheld the right of free speech by turning out of the Town Hall\r\nthose who differed with the speakers; and to John Bright in honour of\r\nhis having represented the town in Parliament for twenty-five year.--On\r\nApril 30, 1863, a handsome silver repoussé table was presented to the\r\nPrincess of Wales on the occasion of her marriage, the cost, £1,500,\r\nbeing subscribed by inhabitants of the town.\r\n\r\n~Price Of Bread.~--At various times during the present century the\r\nfour-pound loaf has been sold here as follows:--At 4-1/2d. in 1852; at\r\n7-1/2d. in 1845; at 9-1/2d. in June, 1857, and June, 1872; at l0d. in\r\nDecember, 1855, June, 1868, and December, 1872; at l0-1/2d. in February,\r\n1854, December, 1855, December, 1867, and March, 1868, at 11d. in\r\nDecember, 1854, June, 1855, and June 1856; at ll-1/2d. in November,\r\n1846, May and November, 1847, and May, 1848; at 1s. and onwards to 1s.\r\n5-1/2d. in August, 1812, and again in July, 1816; and may God preserve\r\nthe poor from such times again.--See \"_Hard Times_.\"\r\n\r\n~Prices of Provisions, &c.~--In 1174, wheat and barley sold at Warwick\r\nfor 2-1/2d. per bushel, hogs at 1s. 6d. each, cows (salted down) at 2s.\r\neach, and salt at 1-4/5d. per bushel. In 1205 wheat was worth 12 pence\r\nper bushel, which was cheap, as there had been some years of famine\r\nprevious thereto. In 1390 wheat was sold at 13d. per bushel, so high a\r\nprice that historians say there was a \"dearth of corn\" at that period.\r\nFrom accounts preserved of the sums expended at sundry public feasts at\r\nCoventry (Anno 1452 to 1464) we find that 2s. 3d. was paid for 18\r\ngallons of ale, 2s. 6d. for 9 geese, 5d. for 2 lambs, 5d. for a calf,\r\nl0d. for 9 chickens, 3d. for a shoulder of mutton, 1s. 3d. for 46\r\npigeons, 8d. for a strike of wheat and grinding it, &c. An Act of\r\nParliament (24, Henry VIII.) was passed in 1513 that beef and pork\r\nshould be sold at a half-penny per pound. In 1603 it was ordered that\r\none quart of best ale, or two of small, should be sold for one penny. In\r\n1682 the prices of provisions were, a fowl 1s., a chicken 5d., a rabbit\r\n7d.; eggs three for 1d.; best fresh butter, 6d. per lb.; ditto salt\r\nbutter, 3-1/2d.; mutton 1s. 4d. per stone of 8lb.; beef, 1s. 6d. per\r\nstone; lump sugar, 1s per lb.; candles, 3-1/2d. per lb.; coals, 6d. per\r\nsack of 4 bushels; ditto charcoal, 1s. 2d. best, 8d. the smallest. Wheat\r\naveraged 50s. per quarter, but the greatest part of the population lived\r\nalmost entirely on rye, barley, oats, and peas. Cottages in the country\r\nwere let at about 20s. per annum. In 1694 a pair of shoes cost 3s. 6d.;\r\na pair of stockings, 1s. 4d.; two shirts, 5s. 4d.; leather breeches,\r\n2s.; coat, waistcoat, and breeches, 16s.; a coffin, 5s.; a shroud and a\r\ngrave for a poor man, 3s. l0d. In November, 1799, the quartern loaf was\r\nsold in London, at 1s. l0-1/2d. and in this town at 1s. 4d., the farmers\r\ncoming here to market having to be protected by constables for months\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n~Priory.~--History gives us very little information respecting the\r\nHospital or Priory of St. Thomas the Apostle [See \"_Old Square_\"] and\r\nstill less as the Church or Chapel of St. Thomas the Martyr. The site of\r\nthe Priory was most probably where the Old Square was laid out, though\r\nduring the many alterations that have latterly been made not a single\r\nstone has been discovered to prove it so. A few bones were found during\r\nthe months of Aug. and Sept., 1884, and it is said that many years back\r\na quantity of similar remains were discovered while cellars were being\r\nmade under some of the houses in Ball Street, and one late writer speaks\r\nof cellars or crypts, which were hastily built up again. From these few\r\ntraces it is not unlikely that the Chapel existed somewhere between the\r\nMinories and Steelhouse Lane, monkish chants probably resounding where\r\nnow the members of the Society of Friends sit in silent prayer. Ancient\r\nrecords tell us that in 1285 three persons (William of Birmingham,\r\nThomas of Maidenhacche, and Ranulph of Rugby) gave 23 acres of land at\r\nAston and Saltley (then spelt Saluteleye) for the \"endowment\" of the\r\nHospital of St. Thomas the Apostle, but that rather goes to prove the\r\nprevious existence of a religious edifice instead of dating its\r\nfoundation. In 1310 the Lord of Birmingham gave an additional 22 acres,\r\nand many others added largely at the time, a full list of these donors\r\nbeing given in Toulmin Smith's \"Memorials of old Birmingham.\" In 1350,\r\n70 acres in Birmingham parish and 30 acres in Aston were added to the\r\npossessions of the Priory, which by 1547, when all were confiscated,\r\nmust have become of great value. The principal portions of the Priory\r\nlands in Aston and Saltley went to enrich the Holte family, one (if not\r\nthe chief) recipient being the brother-in-law of Sir Thomas Holte; but\r\nthe grounds and land surrounding the Priory and Chapel appear to have\r\nbeen gradually sold to others, the Smallbroke family acquiring the chief\r\npart. The ruins of the old buildings doubtless formed a public\r\nstonequarry for the builders of the 17th century, as even Hutton can\r\nspeak of but few relics being left in his time, and those he carefully\r\nmade use of himself! From the mention in an old deed of an ancient well\r\ncalled the \"Scitewell\" (probably \"Saints' Well\"), the Priory grounds\r\nseem to have extended along Dale End to the Butts (Stafford Street),\r\nwhere the water was sufficiently abundant to require a bridge. It was\r\noriginally intended to have a highly-respectable street in the\r\nneighbourhood named St. Thomas Street, after the name of the old Priory,\r\na like proviso being made when John Street was laid out for building.\r\n\r\n~Prisons.~--Before the incorporation of the borough all offenders in the\r\nManor of Aston were confined in Bordesley Prison, otherwise \"Tarte's\r\nHole\" (from the name of one of the keepers), situate in High Street,\r\nBordesley. It was classed in 1802 as one of the worst gaols in the\r\nkingdom. The prison was in the backyard of the keeper's house, and it\r\ncomprised two dark, damp dungeons, twelve feet by seven feet, to which\r\naccess was gained through a trapdoor, level with the yard, and down ten\r\nsteps. The only light or air that could reach these cells (which\r\nsometimes were an inch deep in water) was through a single iron-grated\r\naperture about a foot square. For petty offenders, runaway apprentices,\r\nand disobedient servants, there were two other rooms, opening into the\r\nyard, each about twelve feet square. Prisoners' allowance was 4d. per\r\nday and a rug to cover them at night on their straw. In 1809 the use of\r\nthe underground rooms was put a stop to, and the churchwardens allowed\r\nthe prisoners a shilling per day for sustenance. Those sentenced to the\r\nstocks or to be whipped received their punishments in the street\r\nopposite the prison, and, if committed for trial, were put in leg-irons\r\nuntil called for by \"the runners.\" The place was used as a lock-up for\r\nsome time after the incorporation, and the old irons were kept on show\r\nfor years.--The old Debtors' Prison in 1802 was in Philip Street, in a\r\nlittle back courtyard, not fourteen feet square, and it consisted of one\r\ndamp, dirty dungeon, ten feet by eleven feet, at the bottom of a descent\r\nof seven steps, with a sleeping-room, about same size, over it. In these\r\nrooms male and female alike were confined, at one time to the number of\r\nfifteen; each being allowed 3d. per day by their parishes, and a little\r\nstraw on the floor at night for bedding, unless they chose to pay the\r\nkeeper 2s. a week for a bed in his house. In 1809 the debtors were\r\nremoved to the Old Court House [See \"_Court of Requests_\"], where the\r\nsleeping arrangements were of a better character. Howard, the \"Prison\r\nPhilanthropist,\" visited the Philip Street prison in 1782, when he found\r\nthat the prisoners were not allowed to do any work, enforced idleness\r\n(as well as semi-starvation) being part of the punishment. He mentions\r\nthe case of a shoemaker who was incarcerated for a debt of 15s., which\r\nthe keeper of the prison had to pay through kindly allowing the man to\r\nfinish some work he had begun before being locked up. In these\r\nenlightened days no man is imprisoned for owing money, but only because\r\nhe does not pay it when told to do so.--See also \"_Dungeon_\" and\r\n\"_Gaols_.\"\r\n\r\n~Privateering.~--Most likely there was some truth in the statement that\r\nchains and shackles were made here for the slave-ships of former days,\r\nand from the following letter written to Matthew Boulton in October,\r\n1778, there can be little doubt but that he at least had a share in some\r\nof the privateering exploits of the time, though living so far from a\r\nseaport:--\"One of the vessels _our_ little brig took last year was\r\nfitted out at New York, and in a cruise of thirteen weeks has taken\r\nthirteen prizes, twelve of which are carried safe in, and we have advice\r\nof 200 hogsheads of tobacco being shipped as part of the prizes, which\r\nif now here would fetch us £10,000,\" &c.\r\n\r\n~Progress of the Town.~--The Borough Surveyor favours us yearly with\r\nstatistics giving the number of new buildings erected, or for which\r\nplans have been approved, and to show how rapidly the town is\r\nprogressing in extent, we give a few of the figures. The year 1854 is\r\nmemorable in the building trade, as there were 2,219 new houses erected,\r\nthe average for years after not being 1,000. In 1861 the number was but\r\n952; in 1862, 1,350; in 1863, 1,694; in 1864, 1,419; in 1865, 1,056; in\r\n1866, 1,411; in 1867, 1,408; in 1868, 1,548; in 1869, 1,709; in 1870,\r\n1,324; in 1871, 1,076; in 1872, 1,265; in 1873, 993. The building report\r\nfor the last ten years is thus tabulated:--\r\n\r\n\r\n              1874  1875  1876  1877  1878  1879  1880  1881  1882  1883\r\n              ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----\r\nHouses        1611  3395  2903  2700  1205  1197  1301  1236   666   938\r\nand Shops\r\nChurches         1     1     1     1    --    --    --    --     2     2\r\nChapels          2     2     5     3     1    --     1     1    --     1\r\nSchools          9    15     6     6     4    --    --     2     6     1\r\nManufactories\r\nand             76    80   107    86    64   102    64    91    64    73\r\nWarehouses\r\nMiscellaneous   42    48    43    90    96   101    71    84    62    97\r\nAlterations     47    67    52   167   290   225   222   180   163   158\r\n              ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----  ----\r\n              1788  3608  3117  3053  1660  1625  1659  1594   963  1235\r\n                                                                    [1]\r\n\r\n[1] [Transcriber's note: This is an error; the column adds up to 1270]\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of \"Miscellaneous\" are included such erections as\r\nlibraries, public halls, clubs, arcades, slaughterhouses, cowsheds, and\r\nall other necessary and useful buildings appertaining to human hives,\r\nbut which need not be particularised.\r\n\r\n~Probate.~--The Probate Registry Office is at No. 15, Old Square.\r\n\r\n~Promenades~--When Corporation Street is finished, and its pathways\r\nnicely shaded with green-leaved trees, it will doubtless be not only the\r\nchief business street of the town, but also the most popular promenade.\r\nAt present the gay votaries of dress and fashion principally honour New\r\nStreet, especially on Saturday mornings. Hagley Road, on Sunday\r\nevenings, is particularly affected by some as their favourite promenade.\r\n\r\n~Proof House.~--The foundation stone of the Proof House, Banbury Street,\r\nwas laid October 4th, 1813, the yearly number of gun, rifle, and pistol\r\nbarrels proved at the establishment averages over half a million.--See\r\n\"_Trades_\"\r\n\r\n~Property.~--The Birmingham Property Owners' and Ratepayers' Protection\r\nAssociation was formed in May, 1872. Out of 70,000 separate assessments\r\nthe owners pay the rates in more than 50,000 cases.\r\n\r\n~Provident Dispensaries.~--See \"Dispensaries.\"\r\n\r\n~Provident Societies.~--See \"_Friendly, benevolent, and Provident\r\nInstitutions_.\"\r\n\r\n~Provincialisms.~--Like the inhabitants of most other parts of the\r\ncountry Birmingham people are not without their peculiarities of speech,\r\nnot so strongly characterised perhaps as those of the good folks of\r\nSomersetshire, or even some of our neighbours in the Black Country, but\r\nstill noticeable. For instance, few workmen will take a holiday; they\r\nprefer a \"day's out\" or \"play.\" They will not let go or abandon\r\nanything, but they \"loose\" it. They do not tell you to remove, but \"be\r\noff.\" They prefer to \"pay at twice\" in lieu of in two instalments. The\r\nuse of the word \"her\" in place of \"she\" is very common, as well as the\r\ncurious term \"just now,\" for an indefinite time to come, as \"Her'll do\r\nit just now,\" instead of \"She will do it soon.\" In vulgar parlance this\r\nbook is not your own or our own, but \"yourn\" or \"ourn,\" or it may be\r\n\"hisn\" or \"hern.\" In pronunciation as well, though perhaps not so\r\nmarkedly, our people are sometimes peculiar, as when they ask for a\r\n\"stahmp\" or put out their \"tong,\" &c., stress being often laid also on\r\nthe word \"and,\" as well as upon syllables not requiring it, as\r\ndiction_ary_, volun_teers_, &c.\r\n\r\n~Public Buildings.~--The Guild Hall, in New Street, and the Roundabout\r\nHouse in High Street were at one time the only public buildings in the\r\ntown, besides the Parish Church, the Lockups, and the Pinfold. The\r\nMarket Cross, Public Office, Workhouse, &c., came after, and it is only\r\nof late years we have been able to boast of Town Hall, Market Hall,\r\nParish Office, Council House and all the other establishments so\r\nnecessary to the dignity of a town ranking as third largest in the\r\nKingdom. The huge piles that have been erected during the last dozen\r\nyears or so are of so varied a character that it becomes somewhat\r\ndifficult to draw a line between those which are strictly of a private\r\nnature and the so-called \"public\" buildings; under which heading perhaps\r\neven Railway Stations, Banks, and Theatres might properly come. The\r\nfollowing are some of the chief edifices not noted elsewhere:--\r\n\r\n_County Court_.--The new County Court, at the corner of Corporation\r\nStreet and Newton Street, was erected from the plans of Mr. J. Williams\r\nat a cost of about £20,000. It is built of Hollington Stone, in Italian\r\nstyle, though, like that other Government-built edifice, the new Post\r\nOffice, it is of too heavy an appearance. The two entrances for the\r\ngeneral public are in Newton Street, the Registrar's and principal\r\nCourts being on the first floor, though neither are near large enough\r\nfor the business intended to be practised therein. The entrance to the\r\nJudge's rooms is in Corporation Street, under a portico with Doric\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\n_Drill Hall_--In 1880 a company was formed, with a capital of £5,000 in\r\n£20 shares, for the purpose of building a Drill Hall and suitable\r\nhead-quarters for the local Volunteers. A site in Thorpe Street,\r\ncontaining 2,287 square yards, was taken on lease for 99 years at £100\r\nrental, and very suitable premises have been erected, the frontage to\r\nthe street (183 ft.) allowing the formation of a lofty drill hall, 180\r\nft. long by 85 ft. wide, at the rear of the usual and useful offices and\r\nrooms required. The latter comprise on the ground floor an orderly room\r\nand strong room, sergeant-major's office, armoury, clothing store,\r\nnon-commissioned officers' room, privates' meeting room,\r\nsergeant-major's and staff-sergeant's quarters, and stables. On the\r\nfirst floor there are an officers' meeting room, a sergeants' meeting\r\nroom, long galleries, &c.; the whole building being characteristically\r\nlaid out for military purposes.\r\n\r\n_Fire Engine Stations_.--The Central Fire Brigade Station, which is in\r\ntelephonic communication with all the police stations, the theatres,\r\nvarious public buildings, and chief manufactories, is situated in the\r\nUpper Priory, between the Old Square and Steelhouse Lane, and is easily\r\ndistinguishable by the large red lamp outside its gate. There are here\r\nkept ready for instant use three manual and one steam engine, the latter\r\nbeing capable of throwing 450 gallons of water per minute to a height of\r\n120 feet, the other also being good specimens of their class. Each\r\nmanual engine has on board its complement of hose, branches (the brass\r\npipes through which the water leaves the hose), stand-pipes for\r\nconnecting the hose with the water mains, &c., while at its side hang\r\nscaling-ladders, in sections which can readily be fitted together to\r\nreach a considerable height. The engine-house also contains a tender to\r\nthe steam machine, a horse hose-cart, a hand hose-cart, and a number of\r\nportable hand-pumps. It is with these hand-pumps that the majority of\r\nthe fires in Birmingham are extinguished, and one of them forms a\r\nportion of the load of every engine. Several canvas buckets, which\r\nflatten into an inconceivably small space, are also taken by means of\r\nwhich, either by carrying or by passing from hand to hand, the\r\nreservoirs of the pump can be kept filled, and a jet of water be made\r\navailable where, perhaps, it would be difficult or impossible to bring\r\nhose. The hose kept at the station amounts to a total length of\r\n2,487-1/2 yards, of which about 1,700 yards is always kept on the\r\nengines, hose-carts, tender, and fire-escapes ready for instant use. The\r\nremainder forms a reserve to allow for repairs, drying, &c. Between the\r\nengine-house and the street is a commodious house for the\r\nassistant-superintendent, with a very pleasant yard on the roof of the\r\nengine-house. Adjoining the engine-house on the other side, is the\r\nstable, where five splendid horses are kept. In the yard stand three\r\nfire-escapes, each fitted with a box containing hose, stand-pipes and\r\nbranches, so that it may be utilised for extinguishing fires independent\r\nof the engines. The total strength of the brigade is twenty-five,\r\nincluding the superintendent (Mr. A.R. Tozer), the assistant\r\nsuperintendent (Mr. J. Tiviotdale), two engineers, and an assistant\r\nengineer. Eighteen of the brigade reside at the central station, the\r\nothers being quartered at the seven divisional police stations and at\r\nthe fire station in Bristol Street (opposite the Bell Inn), at each of\r\nwhich places are kept an escape, or an hose-cart, and one or two\r\nhand-pumps with the needful hose and appliances. The cost of the\r\nbuildings in the Upper Priory, including the site (1,500 square yards at\r\nseven guineas per yard), was about £20,000, there being in addition to\r\nthe offices and stables, a waiting-room (in which two men are on duty\r\nnight and day), a drill ground 153 ft. long by 40 ft. wide, an\r\nengine-room large enough for six engines, good-sized recreation rooms,\r\nbaths, &c. The residences are erected upon the \"flat\" system, and have a\r\nspecial interest in the fact that they constitute the first important\r\nintroduction of that style of building in Birmingham. The advantages and\r\nthe drawbacks, if any, of the system may here be seen and judged of by\r\nall who are interested in the matter. On the ground floor there are\r\nthree residences, each having a living room, which may be used as a\r\nkitchen and two bed rooms adjoining. A semicircular open staircase gives\r\naccess to the flats, and on the first floor there are four residences,\r\none being formed over the firemen's waiting room and office. On this\r\nfloor additional bed rooms are provided for men with families requiring\r\nthem; and the second floor is a reproduction of the first. On the top of\r\nall there is a flat upon which are erected five wash-houses, the\r\nremainder of the space being used as a drying ground or play ground for\r\nchildren, the whole enclosed with iron palisades. In the basement there\r\nis a lock-up cellar for each of the residences.\r\n\r\n_Fish Market_.--A rather plain-looking erection, of the open-shed style\r\nof architecture was put up at the corner of Bell Street in 1870. the\r\nfoundation stone being laid July 14. It has since been enlarged, and is\r\nnow much more ornamental as well as being useful. The estimated cost of\r\nthe alterations is put at £16,000 including fittings. The original area\r\nwas only 715 square yards, but to that has been added 909 square yards,\r\nand Bell Street (to which it will have a frontage of 240 feet), which\r\nwill be widened to 16 yards, is to be covered with iron and glass roof,\r\nLease Lane is also to be widened for access to the market.\r\n\r\n_Lincoln's Inn_.--This is a huge block of offices erected in Corporation\r\nStreet, opposite the County Court, in 1883. and which, like its London\r\nnamesake, is intended for the accommodation of solicitors, accountants,\r\nand other professional gentlemen. There are a number of suites of\r\noffices surrounding an inner court (66ft. by 60ft.), with from two to\r\neight rooms each, the street frontages in Corporation Street and Dalton\r\nStreet being fitted as shops, while there is a large room under the\r\ncourt (48ft. by 42ft.) suitable for a sale room or other purpose. The\r\noutside appearance of the block is very striking, having a large\r\nentrance gateway with a circular bay window over it, surmounted by a\r\nlofty lower. The tower has four clock faces, pinnacles at the angles,\r\nand a steep slate roof and is 120 feet high. There are also two flanking\r\ntowers, at the extreme ends of the front. These have canted bay windows\r\nbelow them, and their pediments are surmounted by figures representing\r\nMercury and Athæne. The space on each side between the central and the\r\nflanking tower is divided into three bays, having ornamental dormers\r\nabove them, and being divided by niches, which will serve to hold\r\nallegorical figures of the arts. The windows are ornamented by tracery,\r\nand the façade is enriched by a free use of carving. The architect is\r\nMr. W.H. Ward, and the cost of the pile about £22,000.\r\n\r\n_Market Hall_.--The foundation stone was laid Feb. 28, 1833, and it was\r\nopened for business Feb. 14, 1835. The building, which is constructed of\r\nfreestone, from the designs of Mr. Edge, cost about £30,000, though\r\nconsiderable sums have since been spent on it. The large vaults\r\nconstructed under the Hall in 1875 coat about £4,000. It contains an\r\narea of 39,411 square feet, being 365 feet long, 108 feet broad, and 60\r\nfeet high, and was originally planned to give stall-room for 600\r\ndealers. The liquor shop, house, and vaults beneath, at corner of Bell\r\nStreet, were let on lease by auction (Nov. 1833) for 100 years, for the\r\nsum of £5,400 and a 20s. yearly rental. In 1876 the Corporation gave\r\n£15,000 to resume possession, afterwards reletting the premises at £800\r\na year, with a further £100 for the vaults. The Street Commissioners,\r\nwhen retiring from office, placed in the centre of the Hall a fountain\r\nof very appropriate design (uncovered Dec. 24, 1851), and ornamented\r\nwith bronze figures characteristic of Birmingham manufactures, but which\r\nhas been removed to Highgate Park. A clock was put above the spot where\r\nthe fountain stood, in April, 1852, which cost £60.--A Market Hall was\r\nerected in Prospect Row in 1837, but was very little used as such. A few\r\nyears back it was partly turned into a depot for American meat, but is\r\nnow simply used for warehouses.\r\n\r\n_Masonic Hall_.--The first stone of this building, situated at the\r\ncorner of New Street and Ethel Street, was laid Sept. 30, 1865, the\r\nceremony of dedication taking place April 26th, 1870.\r\n\r\n_Municipal Buildings_.--The advancement of the town in trade and\r\nprosperity, population, and wealth, made it necessary years ago for our\r\nlocal governors to look out for a central spot on which could be\r\ngathered the many offices and officers appertaining to the Corporation\r\nof a large town like Birmingham. They were fortunate in being able (in\r\n1854) to secure so eligible a site, in such a central position, and with\r\nsuch commanding elevation, as the one at the corner of Ann Street and\r\nCongreve Street, though at first glance the acquisition would appear to\r\nhave been a costly one. The price of the land and reversion thereto was\r\n£39,525, but during the years that elapsed before the ground was cleared\r\nready for building (1872) the interest brought that sum up to nearly\r\n£70,000. The total area was 11,540 square yards, of which 4,455 square\r\nyards were thrown into the streets. Thus, though the original price was\r\nbut 68s. 6d. per yard, by the time the buildings were erected the actual\r\nsite cost over £9 per yard. The plans were approved Feb. 11, 1873, the\r\ncontract for building being £84,120, but during the course of erection\r\nmany important additions and alterations were made to the original\r\nplans, raising the cost to £144,743. Part of the ground was originally\r\nintended to be covered with Assize Courts, but have been devoted to the\r\nerection of a magnificent Art Gallery, &c., so that more than a quarter\r\nmillion sterling will ultimately have been spent on the spot. The\r\nfoundation stone was laid by the then Mayor, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain,\r\nJune 17, 1874, and the erection took about five years, the \"hoarding\"\r\nbeing removed July 18, 1879. The design of the Municipal Buildings is\r\nessentially classical, but not of any particular style, Mr. Yeoville\r\nThomasson, the architect, having given free rein to his own conceptions\r\nof what was required in a modern erection of the nature of a local\r\nParliament House. The south, or principal front (to Ann Street), has a\r\nlength of 296 feet, the frontage to Congreve Street is 122 feet, and\r\nthat to Eden Place is 153 feet. From the ground to the top of the main\r\ncornice the height is 65 feet; the pediment over the central entrance is\r\n90 feet high; the stone cornice of the dome 114 feet; and the top of the\r\nfinial 162 feet, the dome rising behind the central pediment from the\r\nmain staircase. Looked at from a distance, the features of the building\r\nthat at first strike the spectator are the carved groups of life-sized\r\nfigures in the six pediments. The Ann Street and Congreve Street\r\nfrontages have a pediment at each end, of semicircular shape, and the\r\nEden Place frontage has one at the end where it joins the principal\r\nfront. The pediment in the centre of the south front is triangular in\r\nshape, and contains a group of sculptured figures representing\r\n\"Britannia rewarding the Birmingham manufacturers.\" In the other\r\npediments the groups represent Manufacture, Commerce, Literature, Art,\r\nand Science. Under the central pediment, and within a semicircular arch\r\nover the central entrance, is a large and beautiful figure-subject in\r\nmosaic, executed by Messrs. Salviati and Co., of London. Besides the\r\ncentral entrance, which is reached through a portico supported by square\r\nand round columns, and is reserved for the use of the Town Council and\r\nstate occasions, there are four entrances to the building, one at each\r\nend of the principal front, one in Eden Place, and the other within the\r\ngateway which runs through the Congreve Street wing into the courtyard\r\nat the back. By the last-mentioned staircase access is obtained by the\r\ngeneral public to the Council Chamber. The building contains 94 rooms of\r\nvarious sizes, three of the largest devoted to occasions of ceremony,\r\nand the rest to the uses of the different departments of the Corporation\r\nwork. The central of the three reception rooms is 30 feet square, and is\r\ndivided from the other two by an open screen of marble columns, both\r\nrooms being 64ft. by 30ft. The Council Chamber is 39ft. wide and,\r\nincluding the gallery for spectators, is 48ft. long, the fittings and\r\nfurniture being of the most substantial character as well as ornamental.\r\nIn various parts of the building accommodation has been found for the\r\nTown Clerk, the Borough Treasurer, Surveyor, Analyst, Chief Constable,\r\nand every other department of Corporation work. The furnishing of the\r\nCouncil Chamber and the other parts of the Municipal Buildings amounted\r\nto £15,603, the laying in of the gas and water services being £2,418\r\nadditional.\r\n\r\n_Odd-Fellows' Hall_.--Before the New Street Railway Station was erected\r\nthere was an Odd-Fellows' Hall in King Street. The first stone of the\r\npresent building in Upper Temple Street was laid early in 1849, the\r\nopening ceremony taking place Dec. 3 same year. The principal room or\r\n\"hall\" will accommodate about 1,000 persons, the remaining portion of\r\nthe premises being let off in offices.\r\n\r\n_Parish Offices_.--The meeting-place of the Board of Guardians and their\r\nnecessary staff of officers has from the earliest days of Poor Law\r\ngovernment been the most frequented of any of our public buildings.\r\nFormerly the headquarters were at the Workhouse in Lichfield Street, but\r\nwhen that institution was removed to Birmingham Heath, the large\r\nbuilding at the corner of Suffolk Street and Paradise Street was built\r\nfor the use of the parish officers, possession being taken thereof Feb.\r\n26, 1853. Thirty years seems but a short period for the occupation of\r\nsuch a pile of offices, but as it has been necessary several times to\r\nenlarge the Workhouse, as well as to collect very much larger sums from\r\nthe ratepayers, it is but in the natural order of things that the\r\nOverseers, Guardians, and all others connected with them should be\r\nallowed more elbow-room. A parish palace, almost rivalling our Municipal\r\nBuildings in magnificence of ornate architecture, has therefore been\r\nerected at the junction of Edmund Street and Newhall Street, where poor\r\nunfortunate people going to the Workhouse, and whose ultimate\r\ndestination will possibly be a pauper's grave, may have the\r\ngratification of beholding beautiful groups of statuary sculpture,\r\nCorinthian columns of polished granite, pilasters of marble, gilded\r\ncapitals, panelled ceilings, coloured architraves, ornamental cornices,\r\nencaustic tiles, and all the other pretty things appertaining to a\r\nbuilding designed in a \"severe form of the style of the French\r\nRenaissance,\" as an architectural paper critic calls it. Ratepayers will\r\nalso have pleasure in taking their money to and delivering it over in\r\n\"one of the most convenient suites of poor-law offices in the kingdom,\"\r\npossibly deriving a little satisfaction from the fact that their\r\ndescendants in less than a hundred years' time will have to build\r\nanother such suite of offices, or buy this over again, as the Guardians\r\nonly hold the site (1,700 square yards) upon a ninety-nine years' lease\r\nat a yearly rental of £600 (7s. per yard). The building contract was for\r\n£25,490, besides extras, the architect being Mr. W.H. Ward, and the\r\nfittings, internal decoration, and furnishing was estimated at about\r\n£5,000 more, though possibly as the chairs in the Boardroom are put down\r\nat £5 each, if other articles be in proportion, both sums will be\r\nmaterially increased. The work was commenced in June, 1882, the memorial\r\nstone being laid February 15th, the following year. The building, which\r\nhas five storeys, stands on three sides of a square courtyard, and faces\r\ninto Edmund Street. Newhall Street, and a new thoroughfare made in\r\ncontinuation of Bread Street. In general character the three faces are\r\nalike, the masonry being rusticated in Coxbench stone to the line of the\r\nsecond floor, the chiselling finishing with an entablature, and the\r\nremaining two storeys included in one order of Corinthian red granite\r\npillars, which support the main entablature. The front in Edmund Street,\r\n105 feet in length, is symmetrically divided by a central tower, on\r\neither side of which the Corinthian pillars are discontinued until the\r\ntwo corners are almost reached, where they support pediments. The tower,\r\nwhich for a distance above the root is square, contains four clock-faces\r\nand supports an octagonal storey, covered by a panelled stone dome,\r\nsurmounted in turn by a lantern and its finial. The height of the tower\r\nfrom the level of the street is 105 feet, the slated towers over the\r\nlateral pediments being smaller. The Newhall Street façade, 160 feet\r\nlong, is broken into three portions of nearly equal length, and the\r\nmiddle portion is treated differently from the other two. Above the line\r\nof the second floor entablature the windows, instead of being in a\r\ndouble row in correspondence with the storeys, are in this middle\r\nsection of the façade carried almost to the height of the columns, and\r\nthe section is surmounted in its centre by an ornamental pedestal, which\r\nbears a group of sculpture, and at its extremes by slated flagstaff\r\ntowers, whose sides are concave. The purpose of these larger windows is\r\nthe effectual lighting of the Boardroom, which is of the height of two\r\nstoreys. The length of the Bread Street front is 90 feet. The Boardroom\r\nis 60 feet long, 36 feet wide and 24 feet high, the room being lighted\r\nby two sunburners suspended from the ceiling panels, and is handsomely\r\ndecorated throughout. The offices of the Registrar of births, marriages\r\nand deaths are entered from Newhall Street, and there is a special\r\nwaiting room for the use of marriage parties whilst they are preparing\r\nto go before the Registrar, a provision which will no doubt be fully\r\nappreciated by many blushing maidens and bashful bachelors.\r\n\r\n_Public Office_.--The office for the meetings of the Justices was at one\r\ntime in Dale End, and it was there that \"Jack and Tom\" were taken in\r\nNovember, 1780, charged with murdering a butcher on the road to\r\nColeshill. The first stone of the Public Office and Prison in Moor\r\nStreet was laid September 18, 1805, the cost being estimated at £10,000.\r\nIt was considerably enlarged in 1830, and again in 1861, and other\r\nimproving alterations have been made during the last three years, so\r\nthat the original cost has been more than doubled, but the place is\r\nstill inadequate to the requirements of the town.\r\n\r\n_Smithfield Market_.--Laid out by the Street Commissioners in 1817, at a\r\ncost of £6,000, as an open market, has been enlarged by taking in most\r\nof the ground bordered by Jamaica Row, St. Martin's Lane and Moat Lane,\r\nand is nearly all covered in for the purposes of a wholesale market, the\r\nwork being commenced in November, 1880. The main entrance is in the\r\ncentre of the St. Martin's Lane front, and consists of a central roadway\r\nfor carts and wagons, 15ft. wide and 24ft. high, together with a wide\r\nentrance on either side for foot passengers. The main piers supporting\r\nthe large archway are of stone, but the arch itself is constructed of\r\nterra-cotta, richly moulded and carved. Over the archway are two\r\nsculptured figures in red terra-cotta, representing \"Flora\" and\r\n\"Pomona.\" The whole of the carving and sculptured work has been executed\r\nby Mr. John Roddis. The archways are fitted with massive wrought-iron\r\ngates, manufactured by Messrs. Hart, Son, Peard, and Co. The entrances\r\nin Jamaica Row and Moat Lane have arched gateways and gates to match,\r\nthough much higher to allow of the passage of laden wains. The market\r\nsuperintendent's office is on the left of the man entrance. Greatest\r\npart of the St. Martin's Lane front is occupied by the new Woolpack\r\nHotel, and the remainder by shops. The buildings, which are from the\r\ndesigns of Messrs. Osborne and Reading, are designed in the style of the\r\nEnglish Renaissance of the Stuart period, and are constructed of red\r\nbrick, with red terra-cotta dressings. At each end of the St. Martin's\r\nLane front are circular turrets, with conical roof, flanked by\r\nornamental gables, and in the centre is a gable with octagonal turret on\r\neach side.\r\n\r\n_Temperance Hall_.--The foundation stone of this building, which is in\r\nUpper Temple Street, was laid Jan. 12, 1858, and it was opened Oct. 11\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n_The Cobden_.--Though the property of a private company, who have twenty\r\nother establishments in the town, the \"Cobden,\" in Corporation Street,\r\nmay rank as a public building if only from its central position and\r\nfinished architecture. It was opened by John Bright, Esq., Aug. 29,\r\n1883, and cost about £10,000. In style it may be said to be\r\nFrench-Gothic of early date, with Venetian features in the shape of\r\ntraceried oriel windows, &c., the frontage being of Corsham Down and\r\nPortland stone.\r\n\r\n_Town Hall_.--For many years the pride and the boast of Birmingham has\r\nbeen its noble Town Hall, which still remains the most conspicuous\r\nbuilding, as well as the finest specimen of architecture, in the town.\r\nIt was erected by the Street Commissioners, who obtained a special Act\r\nfor the purpose in 1828, to enable them to lay a rate to pay for it. The\r\narchitect was Mr. T. Hansom, of the firm of Messrs. Hansom and Welch,\r\nwho, by a curious provision, were also bound to be the contractors.\r\nTheir original estimate was £17,000, with extras, which would have\r\nraised it to about £19,000, but so far were their figures out that\r\n£30,000 were expended prior to the first meeting being held in the Hall,\r\nand that sum had been increased to £69,520 when the building was finally\r\ncompleted in 1850 by the addition of the pillars and pediments at the\r\nback. The foundations and solid parts of the structure are built of\r\nbrick, the casing or outside of the walls, the pillars, and the\r\nornamental portions being of Anglesey marble, given to the contractors\r\nby the owner of Penmaen quarries, Sir Richard Bulkeley, Bart. The\r\nbuilding was commenced April 27, 1832, and opened Sept. 19, 1834, being\r\nused for the Festival of that year; the first public meeting held in the\r\nHall being on Nov. 28th. The outside measurements of the Hall are--\r\nLength 175ft., breadth 100ft., height 83ft., viz., basement 23ft.,\r\ncolumns 36ft., cornice 9ft., and pediment 15ft,. The forty columns are\r\neach 3-1/2ft. diameter. The hall, or great room, is 145ft. long, 65ft.\r\nbroad, and 65ft. high; including the orchestra it will seat a few over\r\n3,000 persons, while it is said that on more than one occasion 10,000\r\nhave found standing room. Considerable sums have been spent in trying to\r\nimprove the ventilation and lighting of the Hall, as well as in\r\nredecorating occasionally, the medallions of eminent composers and other\r\nworthies being introduced in 1876. For description of Town Hall organ\r\nsee \"_Organs_.\"\r\n\r\n_Windsor Street Gas Works_ with its immense gas-holders, retort-houses,\r\nits own special canal and railway approaches, covers an area of about\r\ntwenty-six acres, extending almost from Dartmouth Street to Aston Road.\r\nThough there can be no grand architectural features about such an\r\nestablishment certain parts of the works are worthy of note, the two\r\nprincipal gas-holders and the new retort-house being among the largest\r\nof their kind in the world. The holders, or gasometers as they are\r\nsometimes called, are each 240ft. in diameter, with a depth of 50ft.,\r\nthe telescope arrangement allowing of a rise of 170ft., giving a\r\ncontaining capacity equal to the space required for 6,250,000 cubic feet\r\nof gas. The new retort house is 455ft. long by 210ft. wide, and will\r\nproduce about nine million cubic feet of gas per day, the furnaces being\r\nsupplied with coal and cleared of the coke by special machinery of\r\nAmerican invention, which is run upon rails backwards and forwards from\r\nthe line of coal trucks to the furnace mouths. The quantity of coal used\r\nper week is nearly 4,000 tons, most of which is brought from North\r\nStaffordshire, and the reserve coal heap is kept as near as convenient\r\nto a month's supply, or 16,000 tons. The machinery for the purification\r\nof the gas, the extracting of the ammoniacal liquor, tar and residuals,\r\nwhich make the manufacture of gas so remunerative, are of the most\r\nimproved description.\r\n\r\n_Workhouse_.--The first mention of a local institution thus named occurs\r\nin the resolution passed at a public meeting held May 16, 1727, to the\r\neffect that it was \"highly necessary and convenient that a Public Work\r\nHouse should be erected in or near the town to employ or set to work the\r\npoor of Birmingham for their better maintenance as the law directs.\"\r\nThis resolution seems to have been carried out, as the Workhouse in\r\nLichfield Street (which was then a road leading out of the town) was\r\nbuilt in 1733 the first cost being £1,173, but several additions\r\nafterwards made brought the building account to about £3,000. Originally\r\nit was built to accommodate 600 poor persons, but in progress of time it\r\nwas found necessary to house a much larger number, and the Overseers and\r\nGuardians were often hard put to for room; which perhaps accounts for\r\ntheir occasionally discussing the advisability of letting some of their\r\npoor people out on hire to certain would-be taskmasters as desired such\r\na class of employees. In the months of January, February, and March,\r\n1783, much discussion took place as to building a new Workhouse, but\r\nnothing definite was done in the matter until 1790, when it was proposed\r\nto obtain an Act for the erection of a Poorhouse at Birmingham Heath, a\r\nscheme which Hutton said was as airy as the spot chosen for the\r\nbuilding. Most likely the expense, which was reckoned at £15,000,\r\nfrightened the ratepayers, for the project was abandoned, and for fifty\r\nyears little more was heard on the subject. What they would have said to\r\nthe £150,000 spent on the present building can be better imagined than\r\ndescribed. The foundation-stone of the latter was laid Sept. 7, 1850,\r\nand the first inmates were received March 29, 1852, in which year the\r\nLichfield Street establishment was finally closed, though it was not\r\ntaken down for several years after. The new Workhouse is one of the\r\nlargest in the country, the area within its walls being nearly twenty\r\nacres, and it was built to accommodate 3,000 persons, but several\r\nadditions in the shape of new wards, enlarged schools, and extended\r\nprovision for the sick, epileptic and insane, have since been made. The\r\nwhole establishment is supplied with water from an artesian well, and is\r\nsuch a distance from other buildings as to ensure the most healthy\r\nconditions. The chapel, which has several stained windows, is capable of\r\nseating 800 persons and in it, on May 9, 1883, the Bishop of Worcester\r\nadministered the rite of confirmation to 31 of the inmates, a novelty in\r\nthe history of Birmingham Workhouse, at all events. Full provision is\r\nmade for Catholics and Nonconformists desiring to attend the services of\r\ntheir respective bodies. In connection with the Workhouse may be noted\r\nthe Cottage Homes and Schools at Marston Green (commenced in October,\r\n1878) for the rearing and teaching of a portion of the poor children\r\nleft in the care of the Guardians. These buildings consist of 3 schools,\r\n14 cottage homes, workshops, infirmary, headmaster's residence, &c.,\r\neach of the homes being for thirty children, in addition to an artisan\r\nand his wife, who act as heads of the family. About twenty acres of land\r\nare at present thus occupied, the cost being at the rate of £140 per\r\nacre, while on the buildings upwards of £20,000 has been spent.\r\n\r\n~Public houses.~--The early Closing Act came into operation here,\r\nNovember 11, 1864; and the eleven o'clock closing hour in 1872; the rule\r\nfrom 1864 having been to close at one and open at four a.m. Prior to\r\nthat date the tipplers could be indulged from the earliest hour on\r\nMonday till the latest on Saturday night. Mr. Joseph Chamberlain and his\r\nfriends thought so highly of the Gothenburg scheme that they persuaded\r\nthe Town Council into passing a resolution (Jan. 2, 1877) that the\r\nCorporation ought to be allowed to buy up all the trade in Birmingham.\r\nThere were forty-six who voted for the motion against ten; but, when the\r\nRight Hon. J.C.'s monopolising motion was introduced to the House of\r\nCommons (March 13, 1877), it was negatived by fifty-two votes.\r\n\r\n~Pudding Brook.~--This was the sweetly pretty name given to one of the\r\nlittle streams that ran in connection with the moat round the old\r\nManorhouse. Possibly it was originally Puddle Brook, but as it became\r\nlittle more than an open sewer or stinking mud ditch before it was\r\nultimately done away with, the last given name may not have been\r\ninappropriate.\r\n\r\n~Quacks.~--Though we cannot boast of a millionaire pill-maker like the\r\nlate Professor Holloway, we have not often been without a local\r\nwell-to-do \"quack.\" A medical man, named Richard Aston, about 1815-25,\r\nwas universally called so, and if the making of money is proof of\r\nquackery, he deserved the title, as he left a fortune of £60,000. He\r\nalso left an only daughter, but she and her husband were left to die in\r\nthe Workhouse, as the quack did not approve of their union.\r\n\r\n~Quakers.~--Peaceable and quiet as the members of the Society of Friends\r\nare known to be now, they do not appear to have always borne that\r\ncharacter in this neighbourhood, but the punishments inflicted upon them\r\nin the time of the Commonwealth seem to have been brutish in the\r\nextreme. In a history of the diocese of Worcester it is stated that the\r\nQuakers not only refused to pay tithes or take off their hats in courts\r\nof justice, but persisted in carrying on their business on Sundays, and\r\nscarcely suffering a service to be conducted without interruption,\r\nforcing themselves into congregations and proclaiming that the clergymen\r\nwere lying witnesses and false prophets, varying their proceedings by\r\noccasionally running naked through the streets of towns and villages,\r\nand otherwise misbehaving themselves, until they were regarded as public\r\npests and treated accordingly. In the year 1661, fifty-four Quakers were\r\nin Worcester gaol, and about the same time seven or eight others were in\r\nthe lockup at Evesham, where they were confined for fourteen weeks in a\r\ncell 22 ft. square and 6 ft. high, being fed on bread and water and not\r\nonce let out during the whole time, so that people could not endure to\r\npast the place; female Quakers were thrust with brutal indecency into\r\nthe stocks and there left in hard frost for a day and night, being\r\nafterwards driven from the town. And this went on during the whole of\r\nthe time this country was blessed with Cromwell and a Republican\r\nGovernment.--See \"_Friends_.\"\r\n\r\n~Quaint Customs.~--The practice of \"heaving\" or \"lifting\" on Easter\r\nMonday and Tuesday was still kept up in some of the back streets of the\r\ntown a few years back, and though it may have died out now with us those\r\nwho enjoy such amusements will find the old custom observed in villages\r\nnot far away.--At Handsworth, \"clipping the church\" was the curious\r\n\"fad\" at Easter-time, the children from the National Schools, with\r\nladies and gentlemen too, joining hands till they had surrounded the old\r\nchurch with a leaping, laughing, linked, living ring of humanity, great\r\nfun being caused when some of the link loosed hands and let their\r\ncompanions fall over the graves.--On St. John's Days, when the ancient\r\nfeast or \"wake\" of Deritend Chapel was kept, it, was the custom to carry\r\nbulrushes to the church, and old inhabitants decorated their fireplaces\r\nwith them.--In the prosperous days of the Holte family, when Aston Hall\r\nwas the abode of fine old English gentlemen, instead of being the\r\nlumber-room of those Birmingham rogues the baronets abominated,\r\nChristmas Eve was celebrated with all the hospitalities usual in\r\nbaronial halls, but the opening of the evening's performances was of so\r\nwhimsical a character that it attracted attention even a hundred years\r\nago, when queer and quaint customs were anything but strange. An old\r\nchronicler thus describes it:--\"On this day, as soon as supper is over,\r\na table is set in the hall; on it is set a brown loaf, with twenty\r\nsilver threepences stuck on the top of it, a tankard of ale, with pipes\r\nand tobacco; and the two oldest servants have chairs behind it, to sit\r\nin as judges, if they please. The steward brings the servants, both men\r\nand women, by one at a time, covered with a winnow-sheet, and lays their\r\nright hand on the loaf, exposing no other part of the body. The oldest\r\nof the two judges guesses at the person, by naming a name; then the\r\nyounger judge, and, lastly, the oldest again. If they hit upon the right\r\nname, the steward leads the person back again; but if they do not he\r\ntakes off the winnow-sheet, and the person receives a threepence, makes\r\nlow obeisance to the judges, but speaks not a word. When the second\r\nservant was brought the younger judge guessed first and third; and this\r\nthey did alternately till all the money was given away. Whatever servant\r\nhad not slept in the house the previous night forfeited his right to the\r\nmoney. No account is given of the origin of this strange custom, but it\r\nhas been practised ever since the family lived there. When the money is\r\ngone the servants have full liberty to drink, dance, sing, and go to bed\r\nwhen they please.\"\r\n\r\n~Railways:~ _London and North Western_.--The first proposal for\r\nconverting Birmingham with the outer world by means of a railway seems\r\nto have originated in 1824, as we read of the share-book for a\r\nBirmingham and London line being opened here on December 14 of that\r\nyear. There was a great rush for shares, 2,500 being taken up in two\r\nhours, and a £7 premium offered for more, but as the scheme was soon\r\nabandoned it is probable the scrip was quickly at a discount. Early in\r\n1830 two separate companies were formed for a line to the Metropolis,\r\nbut they amalgamated on September 11, and surveys were taken in the\r\nfollowing year. Broad Street being chosen as the site for a station. The\r\nBill was introduced into the House of Commons February 20, 1832, but the\r\nLords rejected it in June. Another Bill, with variations in the plans,\r\nwas brought in in the session of 1833, and it passed on May 6, the work\r\nbeing commenced at the London end in July, and at Birmingham in June of\r\nthe following year. The line was to be 112-1/2 miles long and estimated\r\nto cost £2,500,000, but the real cost amounted to £4,592,700, of which\r\n£72,868 18s. 10d. was spent in obtaining the Act alone. The line was\r\nopened in sections as completed, the first train running from Euston to\r\nBoxmoor, 24-1/2 miles, on July 20, 1837. The average daily number of\r\npersons using the line during the first month was 1,428, the receipts\r\nbeing at the rate of £153 per day. On April 9, 1838, the trains reached\r\nRugby, and on Aug. 14, the line was completed to Daddeston Row, the\r\ndirectors taking a trial trip on the 20th. There were only seventeen\r\nstations on the whole line, over which the first passenger train ran on\r\nSept. 17.--The prospectus of the Grand Junction Railway (for Liverpool\r\nand Manchester) was issued May 7, 1830, and the line from Vauxhall\r\nStation to Newton (where it joined the Manchester and Liverpool line)\r\nwas opened July 4, 1837. The importance of this line of communication\r\nwas shown by the number of passengers using it during the first nine\r\nweeks, 18,666 persons travelling to or from Liverpool, and 7,374 to or\r\nfrom Manchester, the receipts for that period being £41,943.--The\r\nBirmingham branch of the South Staffordshire Railway was opened Nov. 1,\r\n1847; the Birmingham and Shrewsbury line, Nov. 12, 1849; and between\r\nDudley and Walsall May 1, 1850. The Stour Valley line was partially\r\nbrought into use (from Monument Lane) Aug. 19, 1851, the first train\r\nrunning clear through to Wolverhampton July 1, 1852. The line to Sutton\r\nColdfield was opened June 2, 1862, and the Harborne line (for which the\r\nAct was obtained in 1866) was opened Aug. 10, 1874. The Act for the\r\nconstruction of the Birmingham and Lichfield line, being a continuation\r\nof the Sutton Coldfield Railway, passed June 23, 1874; it was commenced\r\nlate in October, 1881, and it will shortly be in use. The Bill for the\r\nDudley and Oldbury Junction line passed July 15, 1881. A new route from\r\nLeamington to Birmingham was opened in Sept. 1884, shortening the\r\njourney to London.\r\n\r\n_Midland_.--The Derby and Birmingham Junction line was opened through\r\nfrom Lawley Street Aug. 12th, 1839. The first portion of the Birmingham\r\nand Gloucester line, between Barnt Green and Cheltenham, was opened July\r\n1, 1840, coaches running from here to Barnt Green to meet the trains\r\nuntil Dec. 15, 1840, when the line was finished to Camp Hill, the\r\nMidland route being completed and opened Feb. 10, 1842. The first sod\r\nwas cut for the West Suburban line Jan. 14, 1873, and it was opened from\r\nGranville Street to King's Norton April 3, 1876. This line is now being\r\ndoubled and extended from Granville Street to New Street, at an\r\nestimated cost of £280,400, so that the Midland will have a direct run\r\nthrough the town.\r\n\r\n_Great Western_.--The first portion of the Oxford and Birmingham Railway\r\n(between here and Banbury) was opened Sept. 30, 1852, the tunnel from\r\nMoor Street to Monmouth Street being finished on June 6th previous. The\r\noriginal estimated cost of this line was but £900,000, which was swelled\r\nto nearly £3,000,000 by the bitter fight known as the \"Battle of the\r\nGauges.\" The line from Snow Hill to Wolverhampton was opened Nov. 14,\r\n1854. The first train to Stratford-on-Avon was run on Oct. 9, 1860. The\r\nOxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton line was opened in May, 1852. The\r\nbroad gauge was altered in 1874.\r\n\r\n~Railway Jottings.~--The London and Birmingham line cost at the rate of\r\n£23,000 per mile, taking nearly five years to make, about 20,000 men\r\nbeing employed, who displaced over 400,000,000 cubic feet of earth. The\r\nGrand Junction averaged £16,000 per mile, and at one time there were\r\n11,000 men at work upon it. Slate slabs were originally tried for\r\nsleepers on the Birmingham and London line.\r\n\r\nThe first railway carriages were built very like to coaches, with an\r\noutside seat at each end for the guard, though passengers often sat\r\nthere for the sake of seeing the country.\r\n\r\nThe fares first charged between Birmingham and London were 30s. by first\r\nclass, and 20s. second class (open carriages) by day trains; 32s. 6d.\r\nfirst class and 25s. second class, by night. In 1841 the fares were 30s.\r\nfirst, 25s. second, and 20s. 3d. third class; they are now 17s. 4d.,\r\n13s. 6d., and 9s. 5d.\r\n\r\n\"Booking\" was a perfectly correct term when the lines were first used,\r\nas when passengers went for their tickets they had to give their names\r\nand addresses, to be written on the tickets and in the book containing\r\nthe counterfoils of the tickets.\r\n\r\nThe day the Grand Junction line was opened was kept as a general holiday\r\nbetween here and Wolverhampton, hundreds of tents and picnic parties\r\nbeing seen along the line.\r\n\r\nThe directors of the Birmingham and Gloucester line ordered eleven\r\nlocomotives from Philadelphia at a cost of 85,000 dollars, and it was\r\nthese engines that brought their trains to Camp Hill at first. In\r\ncomparison with the engines now in use, these Americans were very small\r\nones. The trains were pulled up the incline at the Lickey by powerful\r\nstationary engines.\r\n\r\nOn the completion of the London line, the engineers who had been\r\nemployed presented George Stephenson at a dinner held here with a silver\r\ntureen and stand worth 130 guineas. This celebrated engineer made his\r\nlast public appearance at a meeting in this town of the Institute of\r\nMechanical Engineers, July 16, 1848, his death taking place on the 12th\r\nof the following month.\r\n\r\nThe L. & N.W.R. Co. have 46,000 men in their employ.\r\n\r\nThe G.W.R. has the longest mileage of any railway in England, 2,276-1/2\r\nmiles; the L. and N.W.R., 1,774-1/2 miles; the Midland, 1,225 miles.\r\n\r\nThe returns of the L. and N.W., Midland and G.W.R. Companies for 1878\r\nshowed local traffic of 936,000 tons of goods, 693,000 tons of coal,\r\ncoke and other minerals, 20,200 loads of cattle, and 7,624,000\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nThe south tunnel in New Street was blocked April 18, 1877, by a\r\nlocomotive turning over. In October, 1854, an engine fell over into\r\nGreat Charles Street.\r\n\r\nThe unused viaduct between Bordesley and Banbury Street belongs to the\r\nG.W.R. Co. and was intended to connect their lines with the other\r\nCompanies. It now stands as a huge monument of the \"Railway Mania\" days.\r\n\r\nThe extensive carrying trade of Crowley and Co. was transferred to the\r\nL. & N.W.R. Co. May 17, 1873.\r\n\r\n~Railway Stations.~--As noted on a previous page, the first railway\r\nstations were those in Duddeston Row, Lawley Street, Vauxhall, the Camp\r\nHill, but the desirability of having a Central Station was too apparent\r\nfor the Companies to remain long at the outskirts, and the L. & N.W.R.\r\nCo. undertook the erection in New Street, of what was then (and will\r\nsoon be again) the most extensive railway station in the kingdom, making\r\nterms with the Midland for part use thereof. The work of clearance was\r\ncommenced in 1846, the estimated cost being put at £400,000, £39,000\r\nbeing paid to the Governors of the Grammar School for land belonging to\r\nthem. Several streets were done away with, and the introduction of the\r\nstation may be called the date-point of the many town improvements that\r\nhave since been carried out. The station, and the tunnels leading\r\nthereto, took seven years in completion, the opening ceremony taking\r\nplace June 1, 1853. The iron and glass roof was ihe largest roof in the\r\nworld, being 1,080 ft. long, with a single span of 212 ft. across at a\r\nheight of 75 ft. from the rails. This immense span has since been\r\nsurpassed, as the roof of the St. Pancras Station, London, is 243 ft.\r\nfrom side to side. The roof of Lime Street Station, Liverpool, is also\r\nmuch larger, being 410ft wide, but it is in two spans. The station has\r\nbeen since greatly enlarged, extending as far as Hill Street, on which\r\nside are the Midland Booking Offices. The tunnels have been partially\r\nwidened or thrown into open cuttings, additional platforms constructed,\r\nand miles of new rails laid down, one whole street (Great Queen Street)\r\nbeing taken bodily into the station for a carriage drive. The station\r\nnow covers nearly 12 acres, the length of platforms exceeding 1-1/2\r\nmiles. The cost of this enlargement was over half-a-million sterling.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of New Street Station, the introduction of the Great\r\nWestern Railway caused the removal of a very large number of old\r\nbuildings, but the monster wooden shed which did duty as the Snow Hill\r\nStation for many years was as great a disgrace to the town as ever the\r\nold tumbledown structures could have been that were removed to make way\r\nfor it. This, however, was remedied in 1871, by the erection of the\r\npresent building, which is extensive and convenient, the platforms\r\nhaving a run of 720 feet, the span of the roof being 92 feet.\r\n\r\n~Rateable Values.~--In 1815 the annual rateable value of property in the\r\nborough was totaled at £311,954; in 1824 the amount stood at £389,273,\r\nan increase of £77,319 in the ten years; in 1834 the return was\r\n£483,774, the increase being £94,501; in 1814 it was £569,686, or an\r\nincrease of £85,912; in 1854 the returns showed £655,631, the increase,\r\n£85,934, being little more than in the previous decennial period. The\r\nnext ten years were those of the highest prosperity the building trade\r\nof this town has ever known, and the rateable values in 1864 went up to\r\n£982,384, an increase of £326,763. In 1870 a new assessment was made,\r\nwhich added over £112,000 to the rateable values, the returns for 1874\r\namounting to £1,254,911, an increase in the ten years of £272,527. In\r\n1877 the returns gave a total of £1,352,554; in 1878 £1,411,060, an\r\nincrease in the one year of £58,506; but since 1878 the increase has not\r\nbeen so rapid, the average for the next three years being £36,379; and,\r\nas will be seen by the following table, the yearly increase of values\r\nduring the last three years is still less in each of the several parish\r\ndivisions of the borough:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                               1881        1882        1883\r\n\r\nBirmingham parish            £985,081    £991,445  £1,001,541\r\n  Yearly increase              18,483       6,364      10,096\r\n\r\nEdgbaston parish             £179,328    £180,327    £181,552\r\n  Yearly increase               8,474         999       1,225\r\n\r\nAston, part of parish        £355,788    £362,337    £365,875\r\n  Yearly increase               9,419       6,549       3,538\r\n\r\nTotal rateable value of\r\n   the Borough             £1,520,179  £1,534,109  £1,548,968\r\n  Yearly increase              36,379      13,912      14,859\r\n\r\n~Rainfall.~--The mean annual rainfall in the eleven years ending with\r\n1871, in this neighbourhood, was 29.51 inches, in the following eleven\r\nyears 36.01 inches, the two heaviest years being 1872 with 47.69 inches,\r\nand 1882 with 43.06 inches. The depth of rain registered in the last\r\nthree months of 1882 (14.93 inches), was the largest for any three\r\nconsecutive months ever recorded by our painstaking meteorologist, the\r\nlate Mr. T.L. Plant, of Moseley.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Ravenhurst.~--The old house at Camp Hill, which gave names to Hurst\r\nStreet and Ravenhurst Street, leading in the direction of the mansion,\r\nwhere in 1810 there were found a number of coins and tokens of the\r\nperiod of Queen Elizabeth and Charles I., as well as sundry Scotch\r\n\"bawbees.\"\r\n\r\n~Rea.~--This little river takes its rise among the Lickey Hills, and\r\nfrom certain geological discoveries made in 1883, there is every reason\r\nto believe that, in Saxon days, it was a stream of considerable force.\r\nThe name Rea, or Rhea, is of Gaelic derivation, and, with slight\r\nalteration, it is the name of some other watercourses in the kingdom.\r\nFrom time to time, alterations have been made in the course of the Rea,\r\nand prior to the introduction of steam its waters were used extensively\r\nfor mill-power, dams, fleams, and shoots interfering with the free\r\nrunning in all directions. Long little better than an open sewer, there\r\nis a prospect that, within a few years, it may be cleansed and become\r\nonce more a limpid stream, if the sanitary authorities will but find\r\nsome more convenient site as burial-place for unfortunate canines and\r\nfelines.\r\n\r\n~Rebellion of 1745.~--The first news of the Rebellion and of the landing\r\nof the Young Pretender reached here Aug. 19, 1745. The Scotch did not\r\ncome so far as Birmingham, but [though thousands of swords were made\r\nhere for \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\"] some little preparation was made to\r\nreceive them. At a meeting held October 5, 1745, it was proposed to form\r\na regiment of volunteers against them, and Sir Lister Holte found 250\r\nhorses to pursue the unfortunate \"Pretender,\" whose great-grandfather\r\nhad been the guest of Sir Lister's ancestor.\r\n\r\n~Rebus.~--Poking fun at our town is no new game, as may be seen by the\r\nfollowing local rebus (by \"Dardanus\") copied from the _Gentlemen's\r\nMagazine_ of 1752:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Take three-fourths of a creature which many admire,\r\n  That's often confined in a castle of wire;\r\n  Three-fourths of a herb that the garden doth yield,\r\n  And a term used by husbandmen ploughing the field;\r\n  With that part of a swine which is now much in fashion,\r\n  And a town you'll discover in this brave English nation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer was _Bir_d, _Min_t, _G_, and _Ham_--Birmingham, the scribe\r\nwho poetically replied, [**]inding-up by saying that it was\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"A town that in trading excels half the nation,\r\n  Because, Jove be thanked, there is no Corporation!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Recorders.~--The first Recorder appointed for the borough was Mr.\r\nMatthew Davenport Hill, whose name is so intimately connected with the\r\nhistory of Reformatory and Industrial Schools. Mr. Arthur Robarts Adams,\r\nQ.C., who succeeded Mr. M.D. Hill on his resignation in January, 1866,\r\nwas a native of the county, and had acted as Deputy-Recorder for some\r\nyears. He died in an apoplectic fit, while out shooting (Dec. 19, 1877),\r\nin Bagley Wood, near Oxford, in his 65th year. The present Recorder is\r\nMr. John Stratford Dugdale, of Blythe Hall, Coleshill.\r\n\r\n~Recreation Grounds.~--Early in 1854 Joseph Sturge set apart a field in\r\nWheeley's Lane as a public playground for children, and this must rank\r\nas the first recreation ground. The last is the disused burial ground of\r\nSt. Mary's Church, which, after an expenditure of about £1,500 was\r\nthrown open to the public as \"St. Mary's Garden,\" October 16, 1882.--see\r\n\"_Parks_.\"\r\n\r\n~Red Book.~--Quite a local institution is the yearly publication known\r\nas \"The Birmingham Red Book,\" which was first issued in 1865.\r\n\r\n~Reformatories.~--See \"_Industrial Schools_.\"\r\n\r\n~Reform Leagues.~--The first local affair of this kind that we have note\r\nof (though likely enough there had been \"reform clubs\" before that date)\r\nseems to have originated at a meeting of some dozen or so gentlemen at\r\nthe Royal Hotel, Dec 14, 1829. On the 25th of Jan., 1830, a public\r\nmeeting to organise a kind of local political body was held at\r\nBeardsworth's Repository, and it is chronicled that about 15,000 persons\r\nwere present. The result was the formation of the celebrated Birmingham\r\nPolitical Union, though the full name was \"The General Political Union\r\nbetween the Lower and Middle Classes of the People.\" The Union's\r\n\"Petition of Rights\" was issued Dec. 13, and the \"Declaration of\r\nCouncil\" Dec. 20, 1830. This is not the place to enter upon a history of\r\nthe doings of the Political Union, which was dissolved by mutual consent\r\nof the leaders May 10, 1834, but there can be no doubt that it did have\r\nconsiderable influence on the political changes of the period. In 1848\r\nan attempt was made to resuscitate the Old Union, though the promoters\r\nof the new organisation called it the \"Political Council,\" and in 1865\r\nanother League or Union was started, which has a world-wide fame as \"The\r\nCaucus.\" Indeed, it may be safely said the town has never, during the\r\npast sixty years or so, been without some such body, the last appointed\r\nbeing the \"Reform League,\" started Sept. 2, 1880, by the Rev. Arthur\r\nO'Neill and his friends, to agitate for a change in the Constitution of\r\nthe House of Lords.\r\n\r\n~Reform Meetings.~--We have had a few big meetings of the kind one time\r\nand another, and give the dates of the principal. Newhall Hill used to\r\nbe the favourite spot, and the first meeting held there was on January\r\n22, 1817.--On July 22, 1819, there were 60,000 there, and a member was\r\nchosen to represent the town in Parliament. (See \"_Newhall Hill_.\") The\r\nmeeting of October 3, 1831, had only 150,000 persons at it, but May 7,\r\nin following year, saw 200,000 on the Hill.--The \"great\" Reform meetings\r\nat Brookfields were on August 27, 1866, and April 22, 1867.--A\r\nprocession to, and demonstration at Soho Pool, Aug. 4, 1884, at which\r\n100,000 persons are said to have been present, is the last big thing of\r\nthe kind.\r\n\r\n~Regattas.~--Usually the A1 amusement of places blessed with sea or\r\nriver space, but introduced to us (Aug 2, 1879), on the Reservoir, by\r\nthe Y.M.C.A., whose members had to compete with some crack rowers from\r\nEvesham, Shrewsbury, Stratford, Stourport, and Worcester.\r\n\r\n~Registers.~--At what date a parish register was first kept here is not\r\nknown, but Mr. Hamper, the antiquarian, once found some old parts stowed\r\naway under the pulpit staircase, and he had them bound and preserved.\r\nThere are very few perfect registers in this neighbourhood, though Aston\r\ncan boast of one dated from 1544, King's Norton 1547, Handsworth 1558,\r\nNorthfield 1560, Castle Bromwich 1659, and Moseley 1750--The\r\nRegistration Act was passed Aug. 17, 1836.\r\n\r\n~Register Offices.~--The custom of hiring servants at \"statute fairs\"\r\nand \"mops\" still exists in theory if not in practice, in several parts\r\nof the adjoining counties but thanks to the low scale for advertising,\r\nsuch a system is not needed now. The introduction of register offices\r\nwas a great improvement, the first opened in Birmingham being at 26, St.\r\nJohn Street (then a respectable neighbourhood), in January 1777, the fee\r\nbeing 6d. for registering and 3d. for an enquiry. There are a number of\r\nrespectable offices of this kind now, but it cannot be hidden that there\r\nhave been establishments so called which have been little better than\r\ndens of thievery, the proprietors caring only to net all the half-crowns\r\nand eighteen-pences they could extract from the poor people who were\r\nfoolish enough to go to them.\r\n\r\n~Rejoicing, Days of.~--Great were the rejoicings in Birmingham, October\r\n9, 1746, when the news came of the battle of Culloden. The capture of\r\nQuebec, in 1759, was celebrated here on December 3, by a gneral\r\nillumination; the peace-loving Quakers, however, had to rejoice over\r\nbroken windows, for the mob smashed them, one unfortunate Friend having\r\nto provide 115 squares of glass before his lights were perfect again. We\r\nwere _loyal_ in those days, and when we heard of our gallant boys\r\nthrashing their opponents, up went our caps, caring not on whose heads\r\nlay \"the blood-guiltiness,\" and so there was shouting and ringing of\r\nbells on May 20, 1792, in honour of Admiral Rodney and his victory. The\r\nnext great day of rejoicing, however, was for the Peace of Amiens in\r\n1802, and it was notable the more especially from the fact of Soho Works\r\nbeing illuminated with gas, for the first time in the world's history\r\nused for such a purpose. In 1809, we put up the first statue in all\r\nEngland to the hero of Trafalgar, and we made the 6th of June the day to\r\nrejoice over it, because forsooth, it happened to be the jubilee day of\r\nGeorge the Third. What _he_ had done for us to rejoice about would be\r\nhard to tell; even more difficult is the query why we were so gleeful\r\nand joyous on February 1, 1820, when his successor was proclaimed.\r\nGeorge IV.'s Coronation was celebrated here by the public roasting of\r\noxen, and an immense dinner party in front of Beardsworth's Repository.\r\n\r\n~Religious Queerosities.~--Among all its multifarious manufactures it\r\nwould have been strange, indeed, if Birmingham had not produced\r\nsomething new in religious matters, and accordingly we find that in 1840\r\nsome of our advanced townsmen had formed themselves into a \"Universal\r\nCommunity Society of Rational Religionists.\" We have not met with a copy\r\nof their rules, though Tidd Pratt registered them as of a Friendly\r\nSociety (under cap. 4, Will. IV.), but the county magistrates, at the\r\nNovember Quarter Sessions would not pass them nor seal them. Of late\r\nyears there have been introduced amongst us several other curiosities in\r\nthe way of religious bodies, like the Theists, the Polytheists, the\r\nPositivists, the Secularists, the Latter-day Saints, and others.\r\n\r\n~Religious Societies.~--In addition to those noted elsewhere, there have\r\nbeen many societies formed here which may come under this heading, such\r\nas the Lay Association for the Refutation of Infidelity, founded in\r\n1839; the Protestant Association, commenced in 1847; the Christian\r\nEvidence Society, began in 1869; the Church Defence and Reform\r\nAssociation, formed in 1871, the Protestant and Church Association,\r\ninaugurated May 23, of same year, &c.\r\n\r\n~Repository.~--Before the building of the Town Hall, there was no place\r\nin which a town's meeting could be held, except the Public Office in\r\nMoor Street, besides Beardsworth's Repository. As its name implies, it\r\nwas originally built as a sale-room for horses and carriages, but some\r\nof the most important meetings known in Birmingham history have been\r\nheld within its walls, grand banquets were often laid out there, popular\r\nlecturers have discoursed, and popular pugilists exhibited their prowess\r\nin the same arena, and the building has even been used as a barracks.\r\n\r\n~Republicanism.~--In 1873 a small band of Brummagem bouncers\r\npatriotically provided us with a real \"Republican Club,\" and proud of\r\nthe feat announced the world-stirring fact to the \"Hero of Caprera.\" The\r\nsimple honest-hearted General, who knew not the guile of their hearts,\r\nwas deluded into wishing them success. Ten years have passed since \"Mio\r\nCaro Cattell\" secured Garibaldi's autograph, but still Victoria remains\r\nQueen of Great Britain, Empress of Hindostan, and the best-beloved\r\nsovereign on the earth.\r\n\r\n~Reservoir.~--See \"_Canals_\" and \"_Roach Pool_.\"\r\n\r\n~Restaurants.~--Our grandfathers knew them not. They took their chop or\r\nsteak at their inn or hotel, or visited the tripe houses. Indeed, Joe\r\nAllday's tripe shop in Union Street (opened about 1839-40) may be called\r\nthe first \"restaurant\" established here, as it was the favourite resort\r\nof many Town Councillors and leading men of the town. A vegetarian\r\nrestaurant was opened in Paradise Street in July, 1881, and 1883 saw the\r\ncommencement of another novelty in the line, a fish restaurant in the\r\nold Warwick Passage.--See \"_Luncheon Bars_.\"\r\n\r\n~Rifle Clubs.~--The Midland Rifle Club was started in 1875, the\r\nStaffordshire Rifle Association dating from 1861. Both clubs use the\r\nrange at Sandwell Park, by permission of the Earl of Dartmouth. At the\r\nInternational Match at Creedmore, New York, in 1881, the representatives\r\nof this neighbourhood scored high numbers, Corporal Bates (of the\r\nM.R.C.) taking the only first prize secured by visitors in the open\r\ncompetitions of the U.S. Associations.\r\n\r\n~Rights of Man.~--An effigy of Tom Paine, author of \"The Rights of Man,\"\r\nwas paraded through the streets, Feb. 12, 1793, and ignominiously burned\r\nin the evening.\r\n\r\n~Ringers.~--The St. Martin's Society of Change Ringers, date from 1755,\r\nand have always held high rank among the bellringers of the country.\r\nMany old newspapers have chronicled their mighty doings with bobs and\r\ntreble bobs, caters and cinques, in all their courses and changes. In\r\nSouthey's \"Doctor\" (vol. 1, p. 303) mention is made of \"eight Birmingham\r\nyouths who ventured upon a peal of 15,120 bob major, but after ringing\r\nfor eight hours and a half were so fatigued that the caller brought them\r\nround at the 14,224th change, perhaps the longest peal that had ever\r\nbeen rung.\" On February 28, 1881, the ringers achieved a true peal of\r\nStedman cinques, containing 9,238 change, in 6-3/4 hours, being the\r\nlongest peal ever rung in that method, and noteworthy as the composition\r\nof H. Johnson, senr., and rung in honour of his 72nd birthday. In former\r\ndays the local ringers were also famed for their skill with handbells,\r\none celebrated performer being Elijah Roberts, an extraordinary adept,\r\nwho died in 1865. One of this worthy's feats was the ringing (at\r\nLiverpool, [**]ch 23, 1837) a peal comprising [**] of Kent treble bob\r\nmaxi[**] hours--See \"_Bells_.\"\r\n\r\n~Riots.~--In times past the Brums had a bad name for rioting, and when\r\nthe list is looked over many may think it not undeserved.--In July,\r\n1715, the Old Meeting House was destroyed in a riot.--In 1737 the\r\nnail-makers from Worcestershire marched into this town and forced the\r\nironmongers to sign a paper allowing an advance in prices.--Some bigoted\r\nbrutes got up an anti-Methodist movement in 1751, which culminated in a\r\ngeneral riot on Oct. 19, the pulpit and seats being taken out of the\r\nmeeting-house and burnt.--The history of \"the Birmingham Riots\" of 1791\r\nis world-known, and there is no necessity to repeat the disgraceful\r\ntale. The damage was estimated at £60,000; the sufferers recovered only\r\n£27,000,--On Oct. 24, 1793, caused by the enforced collection of the\r\nrates levied to pay damages done in riots of 1791. Two more lives lost.\r\n--June 22, 1795. on account of scarcity of food and the high prices\r\nthereof. Soldiers called out, and they gave two unfortunates leaden food\r\nenough to kill them.--May 28, 1810, two women fell out over the price of\r\nsome potatoes, others joined in and a scrimmage ensued. Constables came\r\nand men mauled them, and the result of the unruly wagging of those two\r\nwomen's tongues was a riot, which lasted four days. Three men were\r\nsentenced to grow potatoes at Botany Bay the rest of their lives.--March\r\n22, 1813, the chapels in Bond Street, Belmont Row, and Ladywell Walk,\r\nwith the Jews' Synagogue in Severn Street, were damaged by a riotous\r\nmob. The Jabet Riots in 1816 were primarily caused by the proprietor of\r\n_Jabet's Herald_ publishing an address showing that \"a man, wife, and\r\nsix children could live on 6s. a week.\" Some cheap food was presented to\r\nthe printer in the shape of potatoes, with which his windows were\r\nsmashed.--Claims for damages arising out of the Chartist riots of 1839\r\nwere made to the amount of £16,283, of which £15,027 were allowed, and\r\nrates were made on the Hundred of Hemlingford for £20,000 to cover the\r\nsame and the expenses attendant thereon. It was a curious coincidence\r\nthat the rioters of 1839 should have chosen July the 15th for their\r\nfiery pranks, the roughs of 1791 having on the same day of the same\r\nmonth, burnt Hutton's and other houses. At the Warwick Assizes, Aug. 8,\r\n1839, Jeremiah Howell, Francis Roberts, and John Jones were sentenced to\r\nbe hung, Thomas Aston had sentence of death recorded against him, and 13\r\nother hot-heads were ordered various terms of imprisonment, for taking\r\npart in the mischief.--At Snow Hill Flour Mills, June 29, 1847, arising\r\nout of the seizure of sundry short weights.--The \"Murphy Riots\"\r\ncommenced on Sunday, June 16, 1867, when William Murphy, the Anti-Papal\r\nlecturer, delivered his first oration. The police had to clear Carrs\r\nLane with their cutlasses, and Park Street was nearly demolished. An\r\nIrishman who threatened Morris Roberts in his public-house was shot by\r\nhim on the 17th, and the act was declared to be justifiable.--There was\r\na disgraceful row (which may well be classed under this heading) at St.\r\nAlban's Church, Oct. 13, 1867, in consequence of some ecclesiastical\r\nexcommunicatory proceedings.--The Navigation Street riot of roughs, in\r\nwhich Police-officers Lines and Fletcher were stabbed, took place March\r\n7, 1875. Lines died on the 24th, and was buried at Aston the 29th. The\r\nsum of £840 14s. was gathered to support his wife and daughter. The\r\nAssizes, held in the following July, may be called \"the Roughs'\r\nReprisals,\" as one was sentenced to death, four to penal servitude for\r\nlife, six to fifteen years each (three of them were flogged as well),\r\none to ten years, one to seven years, and four to five years each.--A\r\nConservative \"demonstration\" held at the Lower Grounds, October 13th,\r\n1884, was broken into and disturbed by Liberals, who held a meeting\r\noutside and then breached the walls, spoilt the fireworks, and added\r\nanother to the long list of Birmingham riots.\r\n\r\n~Ritualism.~--Though there has been many instances of local clergymen\r\nadopting practices which usually come under the name of ritualistic, we\r\nhave had but one \"Martyr to the Cause,\" in the person of the Rev. R.W.\r\nEnraght, of the Church of the Holy Trinity, Bordesley. Among the\r\nnumerous practices of which complaint was made against him were the\r\nfollowing:--The use of lighted candles, the wearing of the alb and\r\nchasuble, the ceremonial mixing of water and wine, the making of the\r\nsign of the cross towards the congregation, the use of wafers instead of\r\nbread, standing with his back to the congregation during the prayer for\r\nconsecration, not continuing to stand the whole time during the prayer,\r\nelevation of the cup and paten more than is necessary, causing the\r\n_Agnus Dei_ to be sung immediately after the consecration, standing\r\ninstead of kneeling during the Confession, and kissing the Prayer Book.\r\nRemonstrance, monition, and inhibition, not being sufficient to teach\r\nhim the error of his ways, Mr. Enraght was committed for contempt Nov.\r\n20, 1880, and taken to Warwick gaol on the 27th. He was released soon\r\nafter Christmas, and another Vicar filleth his place.\r\n\r\n~Roach Pool.~--In the years 1825-26 the proprietors of the old\r\nBirmingham Canal purchased about 130 acres of land, partly in Edgbaston\r\nand partly in Birmingham parishes, for the purpose of forming reservoirs\r\nor feeders for their canal. Part of the area included Roach Pool,\r\nthrough which the boundary line ran, and the pleasant path then by its\r\nside is now 15ft., or 16ft. under water. In Ragg's \"Edgbaston\" is an\r\nallusion to this:--\r\n\r\n     \"In Rotton Park\r\n  No more doth Roach Pool smile. Its humble mirror,\r\n  Wherein the stars were once content to gaze\r\n  On their reflected forms, is buried now\r\n  Some fathoms deep. Yea, with the humble path\r\n  That led beside its banks.\"\r\n\r\n~Roads.~--Same of the roads leading into and out of Birmingham in the\r\nolden days were little better than deep ruts, which were more or less\r\nlevelled about the middle of last century. The making of the great\r\nHolyhead coachroad also graded some of the steeper spots as well as the\r\nlowest, but the modern town improvements must be credited as the\r\ngreatest factor in the levelling of the roads, none of which, however,\r\nwere \"macadamised,\" until 1818. The total length of highways \"taken to\"\r\nand repairable by the Corporation at the commencement of 1884, amounted\r\nto 185-1/2 miles, there being other 12-1/2 miles undeclared. Ten years\r\nago the figures stood at 143 and 40 respectively; but as during the last\r\nsix years, owners of property have been paying at the rate of £17,820\r\nper annum, for completion of the streets and highways so as to bring\r\nthem in charge of the Corporation, the undeclared roads will soon be few\r\nand far between. To keep the roads fit for travelling on, requires about\r\n60,000 tons of stone per year.\r\n\r\n~Rogues, Thieves, and Vagabonds.~--According to some calculations made\r\nby the late Rev. Micaiah Hill, Sec. to the Town Mission, there were, on\r\na given day, in 1880, 1,272 known thieves and bad characters at large in\r\nthe town, of whom 177 were under sixteen years of age. There were 71\r\nhouses kept by receivers of stolen goods, 118 others known to be\r\nfrequented by the criminal classes, and 188 houses of ill-fame, in which\r\n262 women were found on the same day.\r\n\r\n~Rolling Mills.~--There was one at Nechells as early as 1690, though the\r\nexact date of the erection of nearly all these places is a matter of the\r\ngreatest uncertainty. The first steam rolling mill, with the exception\r\nof the one at Soho, was put up at Bradley ironworks.\r\n\r\n~Rotton Park.~--In the list of the tenants of Edward Birmingham, whose\r\nestate was confiscated (circ. 1536), there appears the name of John\r\nPraty, as \"farmer\" of the office of \"keeper of the Park called Rotton\r\n(or Roten) Park,\" with all the profits thereof, and the \"wyndefal wood\r\nand lopwood,\" building timber excepted.\r\n\r\n~Rowley Rag.~--The fusibility of basalt having been theoretically\r\ndemonstrated, Mr. Henry Adcock, C.E., in 1851 took out letters patent\r\nfor the manufacture of a number of articles from the Rowley ragstone.\r\nFurnaces were erected at Messrs. Chance Brothers, and the experiment\r\nthoroughly carried out, a number of columns, window-sills, doorways,\r\nsteps, and other architectural pieces being the result. The process,\r\nhowever, was too expensive, and had to be given up. A number of the\r\narticles were used in the erection of Edgbaston Vestry Hall, where the\r\ncurious may inspect them if so inclined.\r\n\r\n~Royal Visitors.~--It is believed that Richard III. was the guest of\r\nBaron de Bermingham in November, 1189, and possibly King John may have\r\nvisited the Manor, as he was more than once in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood (1206-08), but with those exceptions Charles I. was the\r\nfirst Sovereign who honoured us with a visit. He was at Aston Hall,\r\nOctober 16 and 17, 1642. and on the 18th he went to Packington. He was\r\nalso in the neighbourhood on Friday, July 13, 1644. Queen Henrietta\r\nMaria, his Consort, was hereabouts on July 10, 1643, passing from\r\nWalsall to meet Prince Rupert at King's Norton. Charles II. does not\r\nappear to have been nearer than at Erdington. Prince Rupert paid his\r\nmemorable visit April, 1643. In 1742, the Duke of Cumberland, with his\r\nforces, on their way to Scotland, encamped on Meriden Heath, near\r\nPackington Park.--October 21, 1765, Edward, Duke of York, was here, and\r\ngrumbled at the inconvenient ball-room in which he danced, an event\r\nwhich probably led to the erection of the Royal Hotel.--The Duke of\r\nGloucester May 4, 1805, slept at the Royal, and in the following July,\r\nKing George III. was expected to lay the foundation stone of Christ\r\nChurch, but was too ill to come, and the next Royal visitors were his\r\ngrand-daughter (and our Most Gracious Queen) Victoria, and her mother\r\nthe Duchess of Kent, who on August 4, and 5, 1830, inspected some of our\r\nprincipal manufactories. On a similar errand came the late Prince\r\nConsort, November 29, 1843; his next visit being made Nov. 12, 1849 to\r\nsee the Exposition of Art and Manufactures at the Old Bingley Hall in\r\nBroad Street, which occasion Birmingham men proudly believe led to the\r\ngreat Hyde Park Exhibition of 1851. Her Majesty passed through the town\r\non the 30th of August, 1852, when an address was presented to her.\r\nPrince Albert laid the foundation stone of the Midland Institute,\r\nNovember 22, 1855. The Duke of Cambridge, June 1, 1857, planted a tree\r\nin Calthorpe Park, as part of the opening ceremony. In the following\r\nyear, June 15, 1858, the Queen and Prince Albert inaugurated the\r\n\"People's Park,\" at Aston, and Her Majesty said it was the finest\r\nreception she had ever met with. Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught,\r\nopened the Horticultural Exhibition at Lower Grounds, June 24, 1872. The\r\nDuke of Edinburgh was at the Musical Festival, Aug. 26, and following\r\ndays, 1873. The Prince and Princess of Wales visited the town Nov. 3,\r\n1874, and received a most enthusiastic welcome. Prince and Princess Teck\r\nwere here Dec., 6, 1875; and the Prince and Princess Christian, with the\r\nMarquis of Lorne, visited the Cattle and Dog Shows, Dec., 1883. The\r\nPrince of Wales having accepted the Presidentship of the Agricultural\r\nExhibition Society, it is believed he will again visit the town shortly.\r\n\r\n_Royal Visitors from Abroad_.--The great workshops of Birmingham, and\r\nespecially the Soho Works (in their day), have, for the last hundred\r\nyears, attracted many crowned and coronetted heads from other parts of\r\nthe world, though, in many respects, it is to be feared our town no\r\nlonger holds the pre-eminence in manufacture it once did. The Hereditary\r\nPrince of Brunswick came here, January 2, 1766. The Empress of Russia\r\ninspected Soho in 1776. The Duc de Chartres came on a similar visit,\r\nFebruary 22, 1785, and there were newspaper flunkies then as now, for it\r\nwas gravely recorded that the Duke's horses were stabled at the Swan\r\nInn. His Serene Highness the Statholder and the Prince of Orange called\r\nat Boulton's, August 8, 1796. The Grand Duke Nicholas, afterwards\r\nEmperor of Russia, was here, November 9, 1816. His Serene Highness\r\nPrince Nicolas Esterhazy, visited us in the month of August, 1821.\r\nPrince Louis Napoleon, afterwards Napoleon III., was seen here\r\noccasionally while in exile. The King of Portugal went the round of the\r\nmanufactories, June 26, 1854; Prince Oscar of Sweden, May 8, 1862; the\r\nEmperor of Brazil, July 28, 1871; the Sultan of Zanzibar, July 2, 1875;\r\nArchduke Randolph, Crown Prince of Austria, and Prince Esterhazy,\r\nJanuary 31 1878; and the Duke of Braganza, Crown Prince of Portugal, in\r\nDecember, 1883.\r\n\r\n~Sabbath Breaking.~--In 1776 the churchwardens threatened to punish\r\neveryone caught playing at ball on the Sabbath. In 1779 they frequently\r\nstopped waggons travelling on that day, and fined the owners for so\r\ndoing. In December, 1781, thirty-eight publicans were fined for allowing\r\n\"tippling\" on Sundays.\r\n\r\n~Sailor's Return.~--There are several public-houses in the town with the\r\nsign of \"The Sailor's Return,\" but few of the landlords can tell the\r\nhistory of the first so-named, which is in Watery Lane, at the bottom of\r\nLawley Street. It is near a hundred years ago since \"Old Dr. Spencer\"\r\nwas Vicar of Aston Church, and, though he was fond of hunting, and could\r\nbe \"a jolly good fellow\" occasionally, few parsons have gone to the\r\ngrave more lamented, for he was a man without cant,--a Christian who\r\nnever thought himself better than his neighbours, be they rich or poor.\r\nHis only son was mortally wounded in one of Nelson's battles, but he\r\nlived just long enough to give his watch and a few trifles for his\r\nfather to the sailor who waited on him. 'Twas some time before the \"old\r\nsalt\" got to land, and he had been in another brush with the French, and\r\nhad left a leg behind him. When he delivered his message to the Dr., the\r\nlatter asked what he could do for him. \"Why, sir,\" said the sailor, \"I\r\nshould like to keep a public-house;\" and he did, the Dr. christening it\r\n\"The Sailor's Return.\"\r\n\r\n~Saltley.~--So far as our ancient histories can tell us, there was a\r\nmansion here long previous to the Conquest, and the diligent antiquarian\r\nmay still find an old Saltley Hall, though it looks wretchedly neglected\r\nand desolate. Saltley is one of the busiest of our suburbs, there being\r\nvery extensive Railway Carriage and Wagon Works here, besides other\r\nfactories and the Corporation Gas-works, the population being about\r\n7,000.\r\n\r\n~Sandwell Hall and Park.~--Seat of the Earl of Dartmouth, who frequently\r\npermits the Park to be used for public purposes. Of late, however, it\r\nhas acquired a far greater interest through the discovery of coal\r\nunderneath its surface. The extension of the coal seams in this\r\ndirection was long a debateable question, and the originators of the\r\nSandwell Park Colliery Company were deemed by many to be very foolish\r\npeople to risk their money in such a venture, but after a four years'\r\nsuspense their most sanguine expectations were more than realised, and\r\ntheir shares, which at one period were hardly saleable, ranked amongst\r\nthe best investments of the country. By their agreement with the owner,\r\nthe Company have the right of mining under an area of 185 acres, at a\r\nroyalty of 6d. per ton, with the option of taking a further area of\r\n1,515 acres at a like royalty. The first sod was cut April 12, 1870, the\r\nthick coal being struck May 28, 1874, at a depth of 418 yards, the\r\nshaft, which is 10ft. diameter, being carried down to a total depth of\r\n440 yards--a quarter of a mile; the second shaft, which was commenced\r\nJune 24, 1874, is 15ft. in diameter. The following are the \"winnings\";\r\nbrooch coal, 2ft. 6in. thick, at a depth of 380 yards; best coal, 20ft.\r\n6in. thick, at 418 yard; heathen coal 4ft. thick, at 427 yards; white\r\nironstone, of excellent quality, at 434 yards, and good fire-clay, 6ft.\r\nthick, under that, besides thin seams of gubbin ironstone, and new mine\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\n~Saturday Half-holiday.~--The introduction of this boon to workingmen\r\ntook place in 1851, Mr. John Frearson, of Gas-street, claiming the\r\nhonour of first giving it to his employees.--See \"_Excursions_\".\r\n\r\n~Scandalous Schoolmasters.~--The Rev. Mr. Wills, of Brumingham, with\r\nseveral county esquires and gentlemen, were appointed Commissioners\r\nunder an Act passed towards the close of \"The Long Parliament,\" to\r\nsummon and examine any \"publique preachers, inefficient ministers, and\r\nscandalous schoolmasters who shall be proved guilty of drunkenness,\r\ncommon haunting of taverns or alehouses, dealing with lewd women,\r\nfrequent quarrelling or fighting, frequent playing at cards or dice,\r\nprofaning the Sabbath Day, or do incourage or countenance by word or\r\npractice any Whitsun ales, wakes, Morris-dances, Maypoles, stage plays,\r\n&c.,\" and to remove the same where needed. A _little_ quarrelling or\r\nfighting, or playing at cards, was apparently no offence.\r\n\r\n~School Board.~--The first election took place Nov. 28, 1870, there\r\nbeing the following twenty-eight candidates, the first fifteen named\r\nbeing the chosen elected by the number of votes attached to their names,\r\nviz., Canon O'Sullivan, 35,120; S.S. Lloyd, 30,799; Dr. Burges, 21,925;\r\nDr. Wilkinson, 19,829; John Gough, 17,481; Rev. F.S. Dale, 17,365; G.\r\nDawson. 17,103; G. Dixon, M.P., 16,897; W. Dale, 16,387; C. Vince,\r\n15,943; J.S. Hopkins, 15,696; W.L. Sargant, 15,683; J. Chamberlain,\r\n15,090; J.S. Wright, 15,007; A.J. Elkington, 14,925; G. Baker, J.A.\r\nCooper, Jesse Collings, Rev. H.W. Crosskey, Dr. Sebastian Evans, Rev.\r\nH.W. Holland, ---- Kirkwood, G.B. Lloyd, Dr. Merson, W. Middlemore, W.\r\nRadford, ---- Raffles, and Archdeacon Sandford. 29,183 voters, out of\r\n52,340, recorded their votes. A considerable amount of party feeling was\r\nshown in the contest, the candidates being divided (with one or two\r\nexceptions) into two distinct classes, the Liberals who wanted the Bible\r\nread in the schools without explanation or comment, and the Churchmen\r\nwho went in for Scriptural teaching. The latter party obtained the\r\nmajority by electing the whole of the eight they put in nomination, the\r\nLiberals, who thought they could run the whole fifteen, find that by\r\ngrasping at too much they had lost all the power they had fondly hoped\r\nto acquire. The first meeting of the Board was held Dec. 15, Mr. Sargant\r\nbeing elected chairman and Mr. S.S. Lloyd vice-chairman. During the\r\nthree years' reign of this Board the religious question was a continual\r\nbone of contention, the payment of school fees for the teaching of the\r\nBible in denominational schools being denounced in the strongest of\r\nterms in and out of the Board-room by the \"Irreconcileables,\" as the\r\nNonconforming minority were termed. The practical results of the Board's\r\nproceedings may be summed up thus: The Education Department decided that\r\nschool accommodation was required for 15,000 children; the School Board\r\nborrowed £40,000, received £20,500 from the rates, built five schools\r\n(in Lingard-street, Jenkins-street, Farm-street, Garrison-lane, and\r\nSteward-street), which would hold about 6,000 children, boys, girls, and\r\ninfants, and engaged fifteen teachers, 52 pupil teachers, and two\r\nassistants. They also allowed the sum of 1s. per week for every child\r\ndetained in a certified industrial school, committed by the borough\r\nmagistrates, enforced in some measure the compulsory clauses of the\r\nEducation Act, entered into negotiations for the building of four other\r\nschools, quarrelled with the Town Council, and dissolved without\r\nthanking their chairman.--The second election of the School Board took\r\nplace Nov. 17, 1873, when eighteen persons were nominated, as follow\r\n(the three last being the unsuccessful candidates):--G. Dixon, M.P.,\r\n39,447 votes; J. Chamberlain, 38,901; Miss Sturge, 37,260; C. Vince,\r\n36,505; J.S. Wright, 36,417; R.W. Dale, 34,986; G. Dawson, 34,301; Jesse\r\nCollings, 33,877; Canon O'Sullivan, 32,087; S.S. Lloyd, 29,783; Dr.\r\nBurges, 24,582; A.J. Elkington, 24,213; W.L. Sargant, 24,207; Rev. F.S.\r\nDale, 23,864; Dr. Wilkinson, 23,157; G. Heaton, 23,140; W.H. Greening,\r\n22,881; and W. Warlow, 19,193. This election was fought with all the\r\nrancour of a political contest, Tory and Liberal being pitted against\r\none another in the name of religion, the Book of Books being dragged\r\nthrough the mire of party warfare in the most outrageous manner,\r\ndiscreditable to both sides, and especially so to those teachers of the\r\nGospel, who delighted in the almost blasphemous alliterations of \"Bible\r\nand beer,\" \"gin and Jesus,\" &c., so freely bandied about. The Liberal\r\nparty this time gained the ascendancy, their first \"liberal\" action\r\nbeing to take away the allowance granted to the Industrial Schools, and\r\nreversing as much as possible the policy of their predecessors. It would\r\nbe waste of space to comment upon the doings of the Board during the\r\npast ten years otherwise than to summarise them. The Liberal party have\r\nmaintained their ascendancy, and they have provided the town with a set\r\nof schools that cannot be equalled by any town in the kingdom, either\r\nfor number, magnificence of architecture, educational appliance,\r\nhigh-class teachers, or (which is the most important) means for the\r\nadvancement of the scholars, to whom every inducement is held out for\r\nself-improvement, except in the matter of religion, which, as nearly as\r\npossible, is altogether banished from the curriculum. At the end of\r\n1833, the thirty completed schools provided accommodation for 31,861\r\nchildren, 10,101 boys, 9,053 girls, and 12,707 infants, but the number\r\nof names on the books reached nearly 40,000. Other schools are being\r\nbuilt, and still more are intended; and, as the town increases, so must\r\nthis necessary expenditure, though, at first sight, the tax on the\r\nratepayers is somewhat appalling. In 1878 the \"precept\" was for £46,500;\r\nin 1879, £44,000; in 1880, £39,000; in 1881, £42,000; in 1882, £48,000;\r\nin 1883, £54,000; in 1884, £55,000. The receipts and expenditure for the\r\nhalf-year ended 25th March, 1884, gives the following items:--Balance in\r\nhand 29th September, 1883 £10,522 1s. 7-1/2d.; rates (instalment of\r\nprecept), £27,250; maintenance--grants from Committee of Council on\r\nEducation, £9,866 18s. 4d.; school fees, £4,806 3s. 8d.; books, &c.,\r\nsold, £223 18s. 6d.; rent of Board schools, £655 9s.; needlework sold,\r\n£215 12s. 2d.; grant from Science and Art Department, £306 Os. 3d.;\r\ntotal, £16,074 1s. 11d.; scholarships, £114 13s.; sundries, £44 Os. 3d.;\r\ntotal income, £54,004 16s. 9-1/2d. The following was the expenditure:\r\nRepayment of loans, &c., £11,016 13s, 6d.; maintenance, £30,040 16s. 1d.\r\n(including £23,300, salaries of teachers); scholarships, £126 13s. 3d.;\r\ncompulsion and management, £3,857 3s. 4d.; sundries, £28 4s.; amount\r\ntransferred from capital account, £30 1s. 10d.; balance in hand, £8,905\r\n4s. 9-1/2d.; total, £54,004 16s. 9-1/2d.\r\n\r\nA Central Seventh Standard Technical School has been originated through\r\nthe offer of Sir. George Dixon to give the use of premises in Bridge\r\nStreet, rent free for five years, he making all structural alterations\r\nnecessary to fit the same for the special teaching of boys from the\r\nBoard Schools, who have passed the sixth standard, and whose parents are\r\nwilling to keep their sons from the workshops a little longer than\r\nusual. The course of the two years' further instruction proposed,\r\nincludes (besides the ordinary code subjects, the three R's) mathematic,\r\ntheoretical, and practical mechanics, freehand, geometry, and model\r\ndrawing, machine construction and drawing, chemistry and electricity,\r\nand the use of the ordinary workshop tools, workshops being fitted with\r\nbenches, lathes, &c., for the lads' use. The fee is 3d. per week, and if\r\nthe experiment succeeds, the School Board at the end of the five years\r\nwill, no doubt, take it up on a more extended scale.\r\n\r\n_Aston School Board_.--The first election took place July 29, 1875, and,\r\nas in Birmingham, it was fought on the usual political basis, the\r\nLiberals gaining the day. The Board has nine Schools, with an average\r\nattendance of 11,500 children, out of nearly 15,000 on the registers;\r\n187 teachers, and a debt of £110,000\r\n\r\n_King's Norton Board_.--The first election took place March 19, 1876.\r\nEight Schools have been built since that date.\r\n\r\n~Schools and Colleges.~--What with thirty board schools, about sixty\r\nchurch and chapel schools, and nearly 300 private enterprise schools,\r\nBirmingham cannot be said to be short of educational establishments,\r\neven for the 100,000 children we have amongst us. At the end of 1881\r\nthere were 93,776 children in the borough between the ages of three and\r\nthirteen. Next to the Free Grammar School, the oldest public school in\r\nthe town must be the Lancasterian School, which was opened September 11,\r\n1809, and was rebuilt in 1851. The National School in Pinford Street was\r\nopened in 1813, the Governors of the Free Grammar School having the\r\nprivilege of sending sixty children in lieu of rent for the site. The\r\nMadras school was formerly at the bottom of King Street. The first\r\nInfant Schools we read of were opened in 1825. The first stone of the\r\nIndustrial School in Gem Street was laid April 13, 1849. Ragged Schools\r\nwere opened in Vale Street, September 11, and in connection with Bishop\r\nRyder's, September 17, 1862, and in Staniforth Street, January 11, 1868.\r\nThe schools in the Upper Priory were erected in 1860; those in Camden\r\nDrive in 1869. The Unitarian Schools, Newhall Hill, were opened in 1833;\r\nthe New Meeting Street Schools in 1844. Winfield's in one sense must be\r\ncalled a public school, though connected with a factory and built (at a\r\ncost of over £2,000) for the education of the young people there\r\nemployed. The respected owner of the Cambridge Street Works, like many\r\nother Conservatives, was one of the most liberal-minded men, and\r\nhundreds owe not only their education, but their present position in\r\nlife to the care bestowed upon them at this school.--A Roman Catholic\r\nSchool was opened in Bartholomew Street, October 1, 1872; in Brougham\r\nStreet, December 27, 1872; and new Schools in Shadwell Street, (costing\r\nabout £4,500), June 25, 1883--The Palmer Street Congregational Schools,\r\nwhich cost £2,500, were opened February 12, 1877. The old Wesleyan\r\nchapel, in Martin Street, was fitted up for schools in 1865. The same\r\nbody opened schools at Summer Hill, in 1874; in Icknield Street West,\r\nJanuary 1, 1875; and laid the first stone of another school in Sterling\r\nRoad, September 22, 1884.--the Hebrew National Schools, Hurst Street,\r\nwere opened May 21, 1844.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham and Edgbaston Proprietary School, Hagley Road, was the\r\nproperty of a company constituted by deed of settlement, dated February\r\n28, 1839. The cost of the land chosen to build upon and the handsome\r\nedifice erected was £10,500, the school being opened in 1841. In 1874\r\nthere was originated a Birmingham Higher Education Society, and in 1876\r\na scheme was adopted for a High School for Girls in conjunction with the\r\nProprietary School, a company being formed, with a nominal capital of\r\n£20,000, for the purchase of the property; but the days of the School's\r\nprosperity seem to have passed away, and in August,1881, it was bought\r\nover by the Governors of the Free Grammar School.\r\n\r\n_Blue Coat School_ (facing St. Phillip's Churchyard) founded in 1721,\r\nand was erected in 1724, provision having been made in the Act for\r\nbuilding St. Philip's Church for securing the necessary land required\r\nfor the school for a term of 1,000 years at 10s. per year. The first\r\ncost of the building was about £3,000, but many alterations and\r\nextensions have since been made thereto, the quaint little statues in\r\nthe front being put up in 1770; they are the work of Mr. Edward Grubb,\r\nand are said to have been portraits of two of the children then actually\r\nin the school. The first bequest recorded is that of Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nWhite, who in 1722 left nearly 30 acres of land worth about £250 per\r\nyear for the support of the school. In 1726 Benjamin Salusbury left 30s.\r\nper year for the preaching of a sermon at St. Martin's and St. Philip's,\r\nand a further 40s. per year as a subscription; as did also Thomas\r\nDunscombe in 1729. In 1795 the Lord of the Manor presented the school\r\nwith a slice of Birmingham Heath, above five acres in extent, which is\r\nnow let on a long lease at £96 10s. per year. In 1806 other land was\r\ndevised, and from time to time considerable sums have been invested in\r\nlike manner and in consols, so that a fair income is derived from these\r\nsources, in addition to the voluntary and annual subscriptions, but\r\njudging from the past and the admirable way in which the funds have been\r\nadministered it may be truly said that if the income were doubled or\r\ntrebled so would be the benefits in like proportion. At first opening 22\r\nboys and 10 girls were admitted, and 10 others of each sex were taught\r\nand clothed; the latter system, however, had many inconveniences, and\r\nwas soon discontinued. At present the average number is 150 boys and 100\r\ngirls on the original foundation, 20 being paid for out of Fentham's\r\nTrust.\r\n\r\n_Bourne College_ is situated at Quinton, and is an institution for the\r\neducation of the sons of friends belonging to the Primitive Methodist\r\ndenomination. The memorial stones were laid June 6, 1881, and the\r\nCollege was opened October 24, 1882, with accommodation for 70 boys.\r\n\r\n_Church Schools_.--St. Alban's Schools were commenced in 1865. Bishop\r\nRyder's Schools were opened in December 1860, and for girls in March\r\n1866. Christ Church Schools were built in 1837 at a cost of nearly\r\n£4,000 St. George's Schools were built in 1842; St. John's (Sparkhill)\r\nin 1884; St. Mary's, Bath Street, in 1824, the present schools dating\r\nfrom January, 1847. St. Martin's Church Schools were opened Nov. 1,\r\n1846, but were transferred to the School Board, July 9, 1879; St.\r\nMatthew's, Lupin Street, October 20, 1841; St. Paul's, December 18,\r\n1845; the Legge Lane Schools being erected in 1869. St. Anne's School,\r\nDeritend, was opened May 31, 1870; St. Mary's, Aston Brook, April 16,\r\n1872.\r\n\r\n_King Edward the VIth's Schools_.--For 300 years known as the Free\r\nGrammar School, having been founded in 1551, the fifth year of the reign\r\nof Edward VI., and endowed with part of the property taken by his\r\nreforming father Henry VIII., in 1536, from the religious foundation\r\nknown as the \"Guild of the Holy Cross.\" At the time the charter was\r\ngranted (Jan. 2, 1552) these lands were valued at about £20 per annum,\r\nand so little was it imagined that Birmingham would ever be more than\r\nthe small hamlet it then was, that a funny tale has come down to the\r\neffect that the good people of King's Norton, when offered their choice\r\nof similar lands or a sum equal thereto, wisely as they thought chose\r\nthe \"bird in hand\" and asked for the £20 per year for their school,\r\nleaving the Brums to make what they could out of the bare fields once\r\nbelonging to the brotherhood of the Holy Cross. Like the majority of\r\nso-called charity schools, this foundation was for many generations so\r\nmanaged that the funds went into almost any channel except the purpose\r\nfor which it was designed--the free education of the poor--and even now\r\nit would be an interesting question to find out how many boys are\r\nreceiving the advantages thereof whose parents are well able to pay for\r\ntheir learning elsewhere. The property of the charity is widely\r\nscattered over the town, here a piece and there a piece, but it is\r\nrapidly increasing in value from the falling in of leases the rentals,\r\nwhich in 1827 were about £3,000 per annum, being in 1840 £8,400, in 1860\r\n£12,600, and now £25,000; by the expiration of this century it will be\r\nat least £50,000. The earliest existing statutes are dated October 20,\r\n1676, one of the most comical being that the assistant masters were not\r\nto marry. The head master's salary in 1676 was fixed at £68 15s., with a\r\nhouse and land; in 1738 he was allowed £20 in lieu of the house, in 1788\r\nthe salary was increased to £150; in 1726 to £200; in 1816 to £400; and\r\nnow it is about £1,200. The second master at first received £34 6s. 8d.;\r\nin 1874 he received £300. The first school was the old Guildhall of the\r\nHoly Cross, which was pulled down at the commencement of the 18th\r\ncentury, a new school being erected in 1707, and removed in 1833, to\r\nmake way for the present edifice, which was erected in 1840, from the\r\ndesigns of Mr. Barry, at a cost of £67,000. The school has a frontage of\r\n174 feet, with a depth of 125 feet, being 60 feet high. The \"schoolroom\"\r\nproper is 120 feet, by 30 feet and 45 feet high. In the last century the\r\ngovernors \"set up\" branch schools in Shut Lane, Dudley Street, Freeman\r\nStreet, London 'Prentice Street, and other localities; and in 1838\r\nelementary schools were erected in Gem Street, Edward Street, and\r\nMeriden Street, as preparatory adjuncts to the New Street School.\r\nExtensive changes have lately been made in the government and management\r\nof the Grammar School, which can no longer be called a \"Free School.\"\r\nFormerly the governors were self-elected, but by the new scheme, which\r\nwas approved by the Queen in Council, March 26, 1878, the number is\r\nlimited to twenty-one, eight of them being appointed by the Town\r\nCouncil, one by the school teachers, one each by the Universities of\r\nOxford, Cambridge, and London, and the remaining nine to be chosen by\r\nthe Governors themselves. The first meeting of the new Board of\r\nGovernors was held May 15, 1878. The New Street School is divided into a\r\nHigh School for boys, a High School for girls, and a Middle School, the\r\nother schools being respectively called Grammar Schools. The fees now\r\npayable at the Five Ways School (formerly the Proprietary School), and\r\nat the new schools at Camp Hill and Albert Road, Aston are 2s. 6d. on\r\nadmission, and £3 annually; to the High Schools the entrance fee is\r\n10s., and the tuition fees £9 per annum; to the Middle Schools, 5s., and\r\n£3 per annum. The number of children in all the schools is about 2,000,\r\nand the fees amount to about £4,000 per annum. There are a number of\r\nfoundation scholarships, which entitle the successful competitors from\r\nthe Grammar Schools to free tuition at the High Schools, and ten\r\nexhibitions arising out of the Milward's, and Joanna Leuch's Trusts, for\r\nthe Universities, besides yearly class prizes of considerable value.\r\n\r\n_Mason's Scientific College_.--The foundation of this College, situated\r\nin Edmund Street, opposite the Free Library, was laid on the 23rd\r\nFebruary, 1875, by Sir Josiah Mason, the founder, who in that manner\r\ncelebrated his 80th birthday; and it was opened October 1, 1880. The\r\nCollege, which is estimated to have cost £100,000, was built entirely by\r\nthe founder who also endowed it with an income of about £3,700 per\r\nannum, with the intention of providing instruction in mathematics,\r\nabstract and applied; physics, mathematical and experimental; chemistry,\r\ntheoretical, practical, and applied; the natural sciences, geology,\r\nmetallurgy and mineralogy; botany, zoology and physiology; English,\r\nFrench and German, to which have since been added Greek, Latin, English\r\nliterature, civil and mechanical engineering; the chemistry, geology,\r\ntheory and practice of coal mining, &c. The entire management is in the\r\nhands of eleven trustees, five of whom are appointed by the Town\r\nCouncil, and there is no restriction on their powers, save that they\r\nmust be laymen and Protestants. The students may be male or female of\r\nany creed, or of any birthplace, though preference is given to\r\ncandidates from Mason's Orphanage, and to persons born in Birmingham or\r\nKdderminster, other things being equal. The site contains a little over\r\nan acre of land, extending through from Edmund Street, with a frontage\r\nof 149 feet, to Great Charles Street, with a frontage of 127 feet. About\r\none half of the area is covered by the present buildings, which were\r\nerected from the designs of Mr. J.A. Cossins, who chose the 13th century\r\nstyle, with elaborations of a French character, its stone balconies,\r\nlofty gables, oriel and dormer windows, picturesque turrets, and\r\nnumberless architectural enrichments, forming a contour quite unique in\r\nthe Birmingham district, though much of its beauty is lost through the\r\nnarrowness of the thoroughfare. The College is built in two blocks\r\ncommunicating by corridors, and contains several lecture and other large\r\nrooms, laboratories, class-rooms, &c., so arranged that the attendants\r\non one department in no way interfere with others, there being about 100\r\napartments altogether, in addition to library, reading-rooms, private\r\nrooms, &c. The report for the year ending Founder's Day, February 23,\r\n1884, showed the number of students in the day classes during the\r\nsession to have been 366--viz., 229 male and 137 female students; while\r\nin the evening classes there were 118 male and 54 female students, 20\r\nstudents attending some day as well as evening classes. The number of\r\nindividual students registered during the session 1882-3, as attending\r\nday or evening classes, was 518, as against 462 in 1881-82, and 181 in\r\n1880-81. The accounts showed an expenditure for the year of £8,095 12s.\r\n2d., of which £4,258 7s. 9d. was in respect of the teaching staff. The\r\nexpenditure exceeded the income by £764 0s. 8d., principally on account\r\nof additional buildings, repairs, &c. The trustees have lately made\r\nprovision for nine scholarships, including two entrance scholarships of\r\n£30 each; one of £30, for students of one year's standing; two of £30\r\neach, for two years' students; two of £20 each for honour students in\r\nthe examinations of the University of London; and two technical\r\nscholarships of £30 each, one in the chemical and the other in the\r\nengineering department. The two last are known as the Tangye,\r\nScholarships, having been given by Messrs. R. and G. Tangye, and funds\r\nare being raised for several others.\r\n\r\n_Queen's College_.--Originally established in 1828 as the School of\r\nMedicine; being patronised afterwards by William IV., it being known as\r\nThe Royal School of Medicine and Surgery, under which name it existed\r\nuntil incorporated by Royal Charter in 1843, when it was rechristened as\r\nThe Queen's College. The first building erected for the use of the Royal\r\nSchool was located in Snow Hill, the ceremony of laying the foundation\r\nstone of the present handsome Gothic edifice in Paradise Street being\r\nperformed August 18, 1843, the chapel being consecrated in the following\r\nyear. At first there was but a medical department, but, at the\r\nincorporation, a theological department was added, and for many years,\r\nprincipally through the exertions of Dr. Warneford and Mr. W. Sands Cox,\r\nit was one of the most thriving and popular Colleges in the kingdom, the\r\ncourses of study qualifying for degrees at the University of London, and\r\nfor diplomas of the Society of Apothecaries, and the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons; while theological students, with the College certificate,\r\ncould go up for their B.A. degree, with only a twelve months' residence\r\nat the University. A department in connection with the Arts,\r\nManufacture, and Commerce was opened in May, 1853, and a High School of\r\nTrade and Commerce, for giving an education specially adapted for youths\r\nintended for mercantile pursuits, was commenced in the autumn of 1877.\r\nAn attempt to extend the medical education to female students was made\r\nat one time, but the ladies were refused permission to attend the\r\nCollege June 27, 1873; they are still debarred from studying surgery\r\nhere, and none have as yet entered their names on the list of\r\ntheological students. In the other departments greater facilities have\r\nbeen allowed the fair sex, a Central High School for girls being opened\r\nat the College September 17, 1879, accommodation being provided for\r\neighty pupils. The Museum of Natural History formed at the College soon\r\nafter its opening, long one of the town attractions for visitors, was\r\npresented to the Corporation, and formed the nucleus of the heterogenous\r\ncollection at Aston Hall. The medical students have the advantage of an\r\nextensive Anatomical Museum, and there is, besides, a library of about\r\n6,000 volumes of the best works and books of reference that could be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n_Oscott College_.--The old Roman Catholic College of St. Mary's, at\r\nOscott, was first used as such in 1808. The present building was\r\ncommenced in 1835, and opened May 31, 1838, and is considered one of the\r\nchief English seminaries for Catholic students in theology. The chapel\r\nis 112 ft. long by 33 ft. wide, and is richly decorated, having side\r\nchapels and several handsome memorial windows. The College library is\r\nvery extensive, and includes many very rare, valuable, and ancient\r\nworks, some choice MSS., and a number of \"old masters,\" the latter\r\nhaving been contributed by the late Earl of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n_Saltley Training College_, which covers nearly seven acres of land, was\r\ninstituted in 1847, and was opened at Easter, 1852, for the education of\r\nfuture schoolmasters in connection with the Established Church. The\r\nbuilding cost nearly £18,000 and will accommodate 100 students who\r\nundergo a two years' training, the College being under the inspection of\r\nthe Committee of Council on Education. Government grants amount to about\r\ntwo-thirds of the income, the balance being raised by public\r\nsubscription and from fees. In addition to over fifty scholarships\r\ntenable by students who pass their examination, there are four\r\nexhibitions arising from a sum of £2,000 given in October, 1874, by the\r\nlate Mr. Arthur Ryland (for a donor who desired to be anonymous) to the\r\ngoverning body of this College \"to found a trust for promoting the\r\nteaching of teachers the laws of health, and inducing teachers to make\r\nthat subject one of the things statedly taught in their own schools,\"\r\nand a further £1,000 for four exhibitions to students.\r\n\r\n_Severn Street First Day Adult School_.--The name tells pretty well that\r\nthis school was commenced by some members of the Society of Friends,\r\nthough there is really nothing sectarian about it. Established in 1815,\r\nin a simple way and with but few classes, there is hardly an institution\r\nin the town that can be compared to it in the matter of practical\r\nusefulness, and certainly none at which there has been exhibited such an\r\namount of unselfish devotedness on the part of teachers and\r\nsuperintendents. The report to the end of 1883 stated that during the\r\nyear the progress of the school had been of an encouraging character.\r\nThe following statistics were given of the total attendance at all the\r\nschools connected with the movement:--Number of teachers, 57 males, 25\r\nfemales--total, 82, average attendance, 51 males, 23 females--total 74.\r\nElementary teachers, 173 males, 21 females--total, 194; average\r\nattendance, 152 males, 19 females--total, 171. Number of scholars, 3,370\r\nmales, 653 females--total, 4,023; average attendance, 2,510 males, 510\r\nfemales--total 3,080. The total number admitted since the men's school\r\ncommenced in 1845, and the women's in 1848, had been 40,350. In\r\nconnection with the school there are a number of organisations of great\r\nutility, such as sick societies, building societies, savings' funds,\r\nlibraries, excursions clubs, &c. In the savings' fund the balance in\r\nhand reached £14,000, while over £18,000 had been paid into the building\r\nsocieties. There are a dozen other \"adult schools\" in the town which\r\nhave sprung from Severn Street.\r\n\r\n_Spring Hill College_.--For the education and training of Independent\r\nministers, was first opened in 1838, in the mansion of Mr. George Storer\r\nMansfield, at Spring Hill, that gentleman giving certain landed property\r\ntowards its future support. The present edifice, near Moseley, to which\r\nthe old name was given, was opened in June, 1857, the cost of the\r\nbuilding, &c., nearly £18,000, being raised by voluntary contributions.\r\nIt has room for 36 students.\r\n\r\n_Sunday Schools_.--Sunday classes for the teaching of the Catechism,\r\n&c., date from a very early period of Church history, but Sunday Schools\r\nas they are now known seem to have been locally organised about a\r\nhundred years ago, the Sunday after Michaelmas Day in 1784 being marked\r\nas a red-letter-day on account of there being twenty-four schools then\r\nopened, though the course of instruction went no further than teaching\r\nthe children to read. In 1789 some young men formed the \"Sunday Society\"\r\nas an addition thereto, the object being to teach writing and arithmetic\r\nto boys and youths of the artisan class. In 1796 the society was\r\nextended, other classes being formed, lectures delivered, &c., and it\r\nwas then called the \"Brotherly Society.\" Mr. James Luckcock and Mr.\r\nThos. Carpenter were the leaders, and this is claimed to have been the\r\norigin of Mechanics' Institutes. The Unitarians date their Sunday\r\nSchools from 1787: the Baptists and Methodists from 1795. Deritend\r\nSunday School was opened by Mr. Palmer in 1808, with but six scholars;\r\nin a month they were so numerous that part had to be taught in the\r\nstreet. The first prizes given to the children were new Boulton pennies.\r\nOn Emancipation Day (August 1, 1838) there was a procession of over\r\n3,000 scholars from the Baptist Sunday Schools. In 1812 the Birmingham\r\nSunday School Union was organised. The medallists of this town sent out\r\nabout 800,000 commemoration medals in 1880, when the Sunday School\r\nCentenary was kept. Nearly 2,000 teachers attend the Church schools and\r\nabout 2,500 attend Dissenting and other schools, the number of children\r\non the books of Sunday Schools in Birmingham being estimated at--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    14 years and     Under 14\r\n                         over.         years.

The site includes 17-1/2 acres, and\r\ncost over £7,000, the total cost of the College when completed and\r\nfurnished being estimated at £40,000. About fifty students are\r\naccommodated at present, but there is room for thirty more.\r\n\r\n~Scraps of Local History.~--A foreign visitor here in the reign of James\r\nII., wrote that our tradesmen were in the habit of spending their\r\nevenings in public-houses, and were getting into lazy habits, so that\r\ntheir shops were often not opened before 7 a.m.\r\n\r\nAnother intelligent foreigner (_temp_ Charles II.) has left it on record\r\nthat not only was smoking common among women here, but that the lads\r\ntook a pipe and tobacco with them to school, instead of breakfast, the\r\nschoolmaster teaching them at the proper hour how to hold their pipes\r\nand puff genteelly.\r\n\r\nHutton believed that the scythe-blades attached to the wheels of Queen\r\nBoadicea's war chariots (A.D. 61), as well as the Britons' swords, were\r\nmade in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWhen escaping from Boscobel, in the guise of Miss Lane's servant,\r\nCharles II. had to appeal to a blacksmith at Erdington to re-shoe his\r\nhorse. The knight of the hammer was a republican, and his majesty chimed\r\nin with the man's views so readily, that the latter complimented his\r\ncustomer on \"speaking like an honest man.\" Miss Lane afterwards married\r\nSir Clement Fisher, of Packington, and her portrait may be still seen at\r\nthe Hall.\r\n\r\nDuring the battle of Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington saw a little\r\nfellow in plain clothes riding about on a cob, and, beckoning him up,\r\ntold him he was in danger. The litlle man, however, said he had come to\r\nsee a fight, and meant to stop it out. Shortly after, the Duke wanting a\r\nmessenger, employed the rider of the cob to take a message across the\r\nfield, directing a certain regiment to charge the enemy. This was done,\r\nand the Duke took his messenger's card and saw no more of him at that\r\ntime; but afterwards, finding that the little man was the traveller to a\r\nBirmingham button maker, he appointed him to a situation in the Mint, at\r\n£800 a year.\r\n\r\nIn 1766, it was necessary to have 25 constables ready to protect the\r\nfarmers coming to market with their corn, the times were so hard with\r\nthe poor. In the following year large quantities of rice were purchased\r\nby subscription, and one gentleman, it is said, himself gave away\r\nhalf-a-ton per day for ten days.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, a premium of £30 was offered for the best design of an\r\nilluminated clock, to be erected on the open space in front of Christ\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nA Queen Anne's farthing of rare type was turned up in the Bull Ring, in\r\nJuly, 1879.\r\n\r\nThe body of William Woodward was found (March 21, 1878) in the branches\r\nof a tree in Little Green Lane, he having climbed up there previous to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe giving of free breakfasts on a Sunday morning to the poor children\r\nof the streets, was commenced July 4, 1875, at Park Street Ragged\r\nSchools. A system of supplying school-children with penny dinners is the\r\nlatest philanthropic movement.\r\n\r\nThe hottest day recorded in our local history was June 23, 1868.\r\n\r\nThe Orsini bombs used in Paris, January 15, 1858, were made in this\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nA hundred years back, meetings of the inhabitants were called by the\r\ntolling of one of St. Martin's bells.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of war, or cessation thereof, used to be proclaimed in\r\nthe market by the High Bailiff.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Earl of Stirling officiated in this town as a Nonconformist\r\nminister, simply styling himself the Rev. John Alexander; he died Dec.\r\n29, 1765, and was buried in the Old Meeting grave-yards. His sister, who\r\nbecame Countess in her own right, was married to a local manufacturer,\r\nWilliam Humphrys.\r\n\r\n~Sessions.~--The first of the Borough Quarter Sessions was held July 5,\r\n1839, M.D. Bill, Esq., Recorder. On the 25th of November following the\r\nmagistrates began to sit daily at Petty Sessions.\r\n\r\n~Secular Club and Institute.~--The members having bought the remainder\r\nof lease (32 years) of No. 18, Crescent, for £340, have fitted it up for\r\nthe purposes of their club and on June 1, 1877, the foundation-stone was\r\nlaid of a lecture hall at the rear, 70ft. long by 19ft. wide. St.\r\nGeorge's Hall, Upper Dean Street, was their former meeting place.\r\n\r\n~Sewerage and Sanitary Works.~--The disposal of the sewage of a large\r\ntown away from the sea or tidal rivers has at all times been a source of\r\ndifficulty, and Birmingham forms no exception to the rule. When it was\r\nin reality but the little \"hardware village\" it has so often been\r\ncalled, the Rea was sufficient to carry off the surface waters taken to\r\nits channel by the many little rills and brooks of the neighbourhood,\r\nbut as the town increased, and house drainage defiled that limped\r\nstream, it became necessary to construct culverts, so as to take the\r\nmost offensive portion of the sewage to a distance from inhabited\r\nhouses. A great improvement was looked for after the introduction of the\r\nWaterworks, allowing the use of water-flushed closets in the better\r\nclass of houses, instead of the old style of accommodation usually\r\nprovided at the end of the garden, but even this system became a\r\nnuisance, especially to residents near the river Tame, the receptacle of\r\nall liquid filth from our streets, closets, middens, and manufactories,\r\nand legal as well as sanitary reasons forced upon the Corporation the\r\nadoption of other plans. Our present sanitary system comprises the\r\nexclusion, as far as possible, of closet refuse and animal and vegetable\r\nmatters from the sewers, and secondly, the purification by filtration,\r\n&c., of the outpourings of the sewers, after the partial separation\r\ntherefrom of the more solid constituents. In 1871, when the real\r\nsanitary work of the borough may be said to have practically commenced,\r\nout of about 73,200 houses only 3,884 were provided with water-closets,\r\nthe remainder being served by middens, drained and undrained, the\r\ngreater part uncovered and polluting the atmosphere, while the soakage\r\nfouled the earth and contaminated the wells. From these places in 1873\r\nthere were removed 160,142 loads of ashes, &c., the number of men\r\nemployed being 146, and the cost, allowing for sales, over £20,000, or\r\n£55 10s. per 1,000 of the Population. In the following year the Council\r\napproved of \"the Rochdale system,\" closet-pans and ash-tubs taking the\r\nplace of the old style with middens, the contents being removed weekly\r\ninstead of being left to accumulate for months. At first the new system\r\nwas far from perfect, and met with much opposition, notwithstanding the\r\ncertainty of its being a more healthy plan than the old one; but\r\nimprovements have been made, and it is now generally confessed that the\r\npans and tubs are the right things in the right places. The number of\r\npans in use in 1874 was 3,845; in 1875, 7,674; in 1876, 15,992; in 1877,\r\n22,668; in 1883, 37,287, equal to a collection of 1,900,000 pans per\r\nyear. The sanitary force now numbers 622 men, who, in addition to the\r\nabove, removed in 1883, from tubs, middens, &c., 128,966 loads of ashes.\r\nThe chief depot for this accumulation of refuse and rubbish is at the\r\nCorporation's wharf, in Montague Street, where over £52,000 has been\r\nlaid out in buildings and machinery for its due disposal. At first,\r\nnearly two thirds of the mass had to be taken by canal into the country,\r\nwhere it was \"tipped,\" the expense being so heavy that it entailed a\r\nloss of about 6s. 6d. per ton on the whole after allowing for that part\r\nwhich could be sold as manure. Now, however, the case is different.\r\nExtensive machinery has been introduced, and the contents of the pans\r\nare dried to a powder, which finds a good market; the ashes, &c., are\r\nused in the furnaces for the drying process, and the residue therefrom,\r\nor clinkers, forms a valuable substance for roadmaking or building\r\npurposes, &c., in the shape of concrete, paving flags, mantelpieces,\r\ntabletops, and even sepulchral monuments being constructed with it, so\r\nthat in a short time the receipts will, it is expected, more than\r\nbalance the expenditure in this department of local sanitary work. The\r\npollution of the river Tame in past years led to continuous litigation\r\nuntil the year 1877, when, as the result of an exhaustive inquiry, it\r\nwas determined to form a United Drainage District Board, with powers to\r\nconstruct and maintain intercepting sewers sufficient for carrying the\r\ndrainage of the whole district, comprising Aston, Aston Manor, Balsall\r\nHeath, Birmingham, Handsworth, Harborne, King's Norton, Northfield,\r\nPerry Barr, Saltley, and Smethwick. The first meeting of this Board was\r\nheld December 6, 1877, when it took over the sewage farm at Saltley\r\nbelonging to the Corporation (about 262 acres), the plant and stock, &c.\r\nUp to the present time (end of 1884), nearly half a million sterling has\r\nbeen spent by the Board, whose \"farm\" of 1,500 acres, extends from\r\nSaltley to Tyburn, two and a half miles, and who have now to deal with\r\nthe sewage brought there from 188 miles of main sewers, extending as far\r\nas King's Norton and Selly Oak, Harborne, Smethwick, &c. The whole of\r\nthe black and turgid stream of liquid filth brought down by the sewers\r\nis utilised upon the farm, some 200 cubic yards of mud being lifted\r\ndaily from the settling tanks, to be dug in, while the overflow is taken\r\nby carriers to the most distant parts, and allowed to filtrate through\r\nthe soil, until the resulting effluent is as clear as crystal, while\r\nimmense crops are gathered yearly from the land so treated. An analysis\r\nmade a little time back of a natural deposit from the town sewerage,\r\nformed near the embouchure of several sewers emptying into one of the\r\ngreat arterial mains, showed the absence of all ammoniacal salts and a\r\nscarcity of phosphates, particularly alkaline phosphates, and at the\r\nsame time the presence of a large quantity of protoxide of iron, also of\r\nzinc, copper, and other metals in the state of oxides and sulphurets.\r\nThese metallic salts absorb the sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonia\r\ngenerated by decaying vegetable, and animal matter, and doubtless so\r\ncontributes to promote the health of the town, but nevertheless every\r\nprecaution should be taken against the possible admission to the house\r\nof \"sewer gas,\" which at all times is injurious to health. The analysed\r\ndeposit contained when dried only 1.4 per cent. of nitrogen (not as\r\nammonia) and 3.5 of earthy phosphates; but about 11.7 of protoxide of\r\niron, besides zinc, copper, and other metals to the extent of 2 or 3 per\r\ncent. The latter-named proportions may in some measure account for \"what\r\nbecomes of the pins?\" as in the deposit named (which was nearly solid)\r\nthose useful little articles were exceedingly conspicuous.\r\n\r\n~Shambles.~--The name given to the meat market in Jamaica Row. In the\r\nmap of 1731, \"The Shambles\" are marked as a long block of buildings, a\r\nlittle higher than opposite the end of Bell Street, and in 1765 they\r\nstill remained there, forming a kind of \"middle row,\" among the\r\nincongruous collection of tenements, stallages, &c., that encumbered our\r\nBull Ring, down to the gates of the church itself.\r\n\r\n~Ship Inn.~--The old Ship Inn, at Camp Hill, where Prince Rupert had his\r\nheadquarters in 1643, was pulled down in 1867; the present Ship Hotel\r\nbeing opened February 6, 1868. It was sold in July, 1882, for £12,050.\r\n\r\n~Shirley.~--Situated in the parish of Solihull, though but a village\r\nwith some half hundred cottages, has of late become a favorite spot for\r\nthose fond of a Sunday drive.\r\n\r\n~Shoeblacks.~--An attempt was made in 1875 to form a shoeblack brigade,\r\nbut only ten gentlemen attended the meeting (called June 21), and the\r\nbusiness was left to the irregulars.\r\n\r\n~Smallbrook Street.~--A small stream, formerly ran its course along part\r\nof this site, proceeding by way of Smithfield Passage to the moat, and\r\nthence through the mill-pool, back of Bradford Street, to the Rea. The\r\nancient family of the Smallbrokes held considerable lands in the\r\nneighbourhood, but whether the street's name came from the small brook\r\nor the Smallbrokes is a matter of doubt.\r\n\r\n~Smallpox.~--From the opening of the Smallpox Hospital in May, 1882, to\r\nJuly 10, 1884, the duration of the late epidemic, there were 1,591 cases\r\nadmitted. Among the 1,384 patients who had been vaccinated there\r\noccurred 59 deaths; among the 207 unvaccinated, 90 deaths. No\r\nre-vaccinated person died.\r\n\r\n~Snow Hill.~--There is a difference of 60ft. between the top level next\r\nBull Street and the Bottom of Snow Hill.\r\n\r\n~Soho.~--Prior to 1756 the country on the Handsworth side of Birmingham\r\nwas little better than barren heath, the home of conies and a few\r\nbeggarly squatters, until Mr. Edward Ruston leased from the Lord of the\r\nManor the whole of the piece of common that lay between Nineveh and\r\nHockley on the left of the West Bromwich Road. He deepened the channel\r\nof Hockley brook, and built a small mill by its side, which being\r\npurchased from him in 1764 by Matthew Boulton (who soon acquired the\r\nfreehold also) formed the site of the once world-renowned Soho Works. In\r\n1774, according to \"Swinney's Birmingham Directory,\" these works\r\nconsisted of four squares of buildings, with workshops, &e., for more\r\nthan a thousand workmen. Many more than that number, however, were\r\nafterwards employed on the grounds, and for long years Soho House, as\r\nBoulton's residence was called, was the resort of lords and ladies,\r\nprinces and philosophers, savants and students, to a far greater extent\r\nthan many of the European courts. Of this home of the steam engine, and\r\nthe birthplace of inventions too numerous to count, there is now no\r\nvestige left, the foundry being removed to Smethwick in 1848, the\r\ncelebrated Mint, with the warehouses and shopping, being cleared out\r\nearly in 1850, and the walls razed to the ground in 1853.\r\n\r\n~Soho Hill.~--The top is 177ft. higher than at Hockley Bridge, the foot\r\nof the hill.\r\n\r\n~Soho Pool~ was formed by the make of an embankment (1756-60) impounding\r\nthe waters of Hockley brook, and for some years after the demolition of\r\nthe Soho Works it was a favourite place for boating, &c.. The pool was\r\ndrained in 1866, and, having been filled up, its site will ere long be\r\ncovered with streets of houses.\r\n\r\n~Solihull.~--This very pleasant village, but a few miles distant, could\r\nboast of a Free School for its children at a very early date, for we\r\nread of the buildings being repaired in 1573. In 1882 the School was\r\nrebuilt, at a cost of about £5,700, and its endowments, some of which\r\nwere given in the reign of Richard II., are yearly becoming of greater\r\nvalue as building progresses. The present population is nearly 6,000,\r\nthe rateable value of property being £45,202, from an area of 12,000\r\nacres. The parishes in the Union comprise Baddesley, Balsall, Barston,\r\nBushwood, Elmdon, Knowle, Lapworth, Nuthurst, Packwood, Solihull,\r\nTanworth, and Yardley, including an area of 46,302 acres, a population\r\nof 21,000, with a rateable value amounting to £157,000.\r\n\r\n~Spanish Armada.~--The nobility and gentry of this and adjoining\r\ncounties, at the time of the threatened invasion by the Spaniards,\r\ncontributed sums of money sufficient to hire and equip no less than 43\r\nships of war. Among the names we note the following local subscribers of\r\n£25 each:--William Kinge and William Collmer (Colmore), of Burmingham;\r\nRichard Middlemore, Edgbaston; Mrs. Margarett Knowlys, Nuneton; Gabriell\r\nPowltney, Knowle; Richard Corbett, Meryden, &c.\r\n\r\n~Speaking Stile Walk.~--In a footpath leading from Holloway Head to\r\nEdgbaston Church, there was a stile at a spot from which an exceedingly\r\nclear echo, could be raised, and the footpath being partly thrown into a\r\nlane the latter became \"Speaking Stile Lane.\" The short street or road\r\nat present existing preserves the name, but that is all, the echo, the\r\nstile, and the footpath having vanished long, long ago.\r\n\r\n~Spelling Bee.~--The first \"Spelling Bee\" held in Birmingham took place\r\nJanuary 17th, 1876. Like many other Yankee notions, it did not thrive\r\nhere, and the humming of those bees soon ceased.\r\n\r\n~Springs.~--In Hutton's time there was, \"a short distance from\r\nBirmingham, in the manor of Duddeston, and joining the turnpike road to\r\nColeshill,\" a chalybeate spring of which he speaks very highly, though\r\neven then it was neglected and thought but little of. In 1849 Mr. Robert\r\nRawlinson making inquiries, was told by the Town Clerk that \"the\r\nchalybeate spring in Duddeston was turned into a culvert by the railway\r\npeople when the Birmingham and Liverpool Railway was constructed,\" to\r\nthe great regret of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood who spoke\r\nstrongly of the virtues of the water in diseases of the eye. It was\r\nsuggested in 1862 that an attempt should be made to reopen the spring\r\nfor public use, but as it was nobody's business nobody did it. There was\r\n(sixty years ago) a spring a little below Saturday Bridge opposite\r\nCharlotte Street, which always give forth a constant stream of\r\nbeautifully clear soft water. Another in Coventry Road, where 25 years\r\nor so ago an old man stooping to quench his thirst fell head foremost,\r\nand not being able to recover his equilibrium, was drowned, leading to\r\nthe spring being covered up. Several mineralised springs existed in\r\nGooch Street, and thereabouts, and there was one that sprung out close\r\nto where Kent Street Baths are now. The spring which gives name to\r\nSpring Street and Spring Vale, and which has been turned so that its\r\nwaters run into the sewers, is estimated to discharge 20,000 gallons of\r\npure limpid water per hour. The little stream arising from this spring\r\nconstituted part of the boundary line between the Birmingham and\r\nEdgbaston parishes and at far less cost than it has taken to waste its\r\nwater it could have been utilised for the above-named Baths, less than a\r\nthousand yards off, and with a natural fall of 6ft. or 8ft. Spring Hill\r\ntakes its name from a spring now non-existent, but which was once a\r\nfavourite with the cottagers who lived near to it.\r\n\r\n~Sporting Notes.~--It is not for a moment to be admitted that the men of\r\nBirmingham in past years were one whit more brutal in their \"sports\"\r\nthan others of their countrymen, but it must be confessed they somehow\r\nmanaged to acquire a shocking bad name to that effect. This of course\r\nmust be laid to the credit of the local supporters of \"the noble art of\r\nself-defence,\" the Brummagem bruisers. Bullbaiting and cockfighting were\r\nno more peculiar to this neighbourhood than parson-pelting or woman\r\nducking at Coventry, where the pillory and ducking-stool were in use\r\nlong after they had been put aside in Birmingham.\r\n\r\n_Archery_ at one period of history was so little of a sporting nature\r\nthat laws were passed for the erection of shooting-butts, the provision\r\nof bows and arrows, and the enforcement of constant practice by all\r\nyoung men and apprentices. The monk's mixture of brimstone, charcoal,\r\nand salt-petre, however, in course of time left the old English\r\nclothyard shaft with its grey goose feather and the accompanying\r\nsix-foot bow of yew to be playthings only, or but fit to use in shooting\r\nsquirrels or other small deer. The \"Woodmen of Arden\" is the oldest\r\nsociety (in this county) of toxopholites as the modern drawers of the\r\nlong bow are called, which society was \"revived\" in 1785, the Earl of\r\nAylesford giving a silver bugle horn and his lady a silver arrow as\r\nfirst and second prizes. The members of a local society may in summer\r\nmonths be sometimes seen pacing their measured rounds on an allotted\r\nportion of the Edgbaston Botanical Gardens.\r\n\r\n_Athletics_--The Birmingham Athletic Club opened the Gymnasium in King\r\nAlfred's Place, in Aug 1866, and hold their annual display and\r\nassault-at-arms in the Town Hall in the month of March. Certain hours\r\nare allotted to the ladies' classes, and special terms are made for\r\nyoung men and schoolboys.\r\n\r\n_Bowling Greens_ and Quoit Grounds were once favourite places of\r\namusement, many even of the town taverns having them attached. There was\r\none at the Salutation, bottom of Snow Hill, in 1778, and at an earlier\r\ndate at the Hen and Chickens, in High Street. In 1825 a bowling green\r\nwas laid out at the corner of Highfield Road and Harborne Road, for \"a\r\nvery select party\" of Edgbastonians. There was also one at the Plough\r\nand Harrow, and several may stil be found in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n_Chess_, aristocratic game as it is, is far from being unknown here, a\r\nChess Club having been established half-a-century back, which has nearly\r\na hundred members. Its present headquarters are at the Restaurant, 1,\r\nLower Temple Street.\r\n\r\n_Cock-fighting_.--Early numbers of _Aris's Gazette_ frequently contained\r\nnotices of \"mains\" fought at Duddeston Hall.\r\n\r\n_Cricket_.--There was a Cricket Club in existence here in 1745, and it\r\nhas been chronicled that a match was being played on the same day on\r\nwhich the battle of Culloden was fought. Of modern clubs, whose name is\r\nLegion, the oldest is the Birmingham C.C., started in 1819, the members\r\nincluding the young _élite_ of the town, who had their field opposite\r\nthe Monument at Ladywood. The Birchfield C.C. was organised in 1840.\r\nAmong the noteworthy matches of late years are those of the All England\r\nEleven against a local twenty-two, at the Lower Grounds, June 5, 1871,\r\nthe visitors winning; the Australian Eleven _v_. Pickwick and District\r\nTwenty-two, at Bournbrook, June 24 to 26, 1878, the game not being\r\nfinished, the first innings showing 105 runs for the Eleven, against\r\n123; the Australians _v_. Eleven of England, at Lower Grounds, May 26,\r\n1884, when the Colonials put together 76 against 82 in the first\r\ninnings, the second innings of 33 against England's 26 being won with\r\nfive players left to bat.\r\n\r\n_Croquet_ was introduced in 1867; the first code of laws being published\r\nin October, 1869.\r\n\r\n_Cycling_, though quite the rage at the present time, is by no mems a\r\nmodern amusement, as running a race with \"dandy-horses\" was considered\r\ngood sport in the days of the fourth Royal George. These vehicles\r\nconsisted of two wheels united tandem fashion, the bar being fitted with\r\nsaddle-shaped seat as in the first bicycles, but the motive power was\r\napplied through the contact of the riders' feet with the ground.--The\r\n\"track\" at the Lower Grounds measures 501 yards.\r\n\r\n_Football_ is a game as old as the hills, and there are hundreds of\r\nclubs in the town and district, the best meadow for the purpose (at the\r\nLower Grounds) being about 125 yards long by 75 yards broad. The Aston\r\nVilla is the chief club.\r\n\r\n_Hare and Hounds_.--Every suburb and district has its club of Harriers\r\nor Hare and Hounds, an annual cross-country amateur championship contest\r\nbeing started in 1879. At the last (Feb. 9, 1884) the Birchfield\r\nHarriers scored their fourth victory against the Moseley Harriers twice.\r\n\r\n_Hunting_.--Time was when the sight of scarlet coats and hounds was no\r\nnovelty in Birmingham, but those who would now join in the old English\r\nsport of hunting must go farther afield, the nearest kennels being at\r\nAtherstone. The announcements of the meets in this and adjoining\r\ncounties appear regularly in the _Midland Counties' Herald_.\r\n\r\n_Jumping_.--At the Lower Grounds in July, 1881, Mr. P. Davine, of\r\nBelfast, jumped 6ft. 3in. the highest previous record having been 6ft.\r\n2-1/2in., the performance of Mr. M.J. Brookes, (Oxford U.A.C.) at Lillie\r\nBridge, March, 1874.\r\n\r\n_Lacrosse_, a popular Canadian game, was introduced here June 23, 1883,\r\nby a team of Canadian Amateurs and Iroquois Indians, who exhibited their\r\nprowess at the Lower Grounds.\r\n\r\n_Lawn Tennis_, at first known as Lawn Racquet, was the invention of the\r\nlate Major Gem, who played the first game in 1865 with his friend Mr.\r\nPerera. of Great Charles Street.\r\n\r\n_Pedestrianism_.--Among the earlist noted achievements of local peds. is\r\nthat of George Guest, who having wagered to walk 1,000 miles in 28 days\r\nfinished his task Feb. 1, 1758, with five hours to spare, doing six\r\nmiles in the last hour he footed it.--Mr. E.P. Weston, the walker _par\r\nexcellence_, was at Bingley Hall in April, 1876, and at the Lower\r\nGrounds in Jan., 1884, when on his walk of 5,000 miles in 100 days.--A\r\nsix days \"go-as-you please\" match came off at Bingley Hall in Sept.,\r\n1882, and a ridiculous exhibition of a similar nature occurred in the\r\nfollowing year, when women were induced to walk for the sport of gaping\r\nidiots.\r\n\r\n_Pigeon-flying_ has been for several generations the favourite amusement\r\nof numbers of our workers, and the flyers have a club of their own,\r\nwhich dates from August, 1875.\r\n\r\n_Pigeon-shooting_ is a cruel sport, not much favoured in this locality,\r\nand now that a cheap clay pigeon has been invented for use in this game,\r\ninstead of the live birds, it is to be hoped that the disgraceful\r\npractice will be confined to the Hurlingham boys.\r\n\r\n_Prize-fighting_ was long the popular sport of high and low life\r\nblackguards, and Birmingham added many a redoubtable name to the long\r\nlist of famous prize-fighters, whose deeds are recorded in \"Fistiana\"\r\nand other chronicles of the ring. Among the most conspicuous of these\r\nmen of might, were Harry Preston, Davy Davis, Phil Sampson, Topper\r\nBrown, Johnny and Harry Broome, Ben Caunt, Sam Simmonds, Bob Brettle,\r\nTass Parker, Joe Nolan, Peter Morris, Hammer Lane, and his brothers,\r\nwith a host of other upholders of fisticuffs, the record of whose\r\nbattles will _not_ be handed down to posterity in the pages of\r\n_Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham_, though, as a matter of history, it\r\nmay be noted that the earliest account we have of a local prize-fight is\r\nof that which took place in Oct. 1782, for 100 guineas a side, between\r\nJemmy Sargent, a professional, and Isaac Perrins, one of the Soho\r\nworkmen. Jemmy knuckled under after being knocked down thirteen times,\r\nin as many rounds, by the knock-kneed hammerman fiom Soho, whose mates,\r\nit is said, won £1,500 in bets through his prowess. Attempts have lately\r\nbeen made to revive the old sport, but the sooner the would-be adepts\r\nlearn that their occupation is gone the better it will be for them, and\r\nall men.\r\n\r\n_Racing and Steeplechasing_ was not, unknown to the Brums of the 18th\r\ncentury, as the _Gentleman's Magazine_ makes note of the races at\r\nBirmingham, May 27 to 29, 1740, but where the old racecourse was\r\nsituated it is impossible to tell. Indeed it is doubtful whether any\r\nspecial course has ever long been in existence, as at various dates we\r\nread of races being held at Aston, Bordesley, Deritend, Walmer Lane, and\r\nother places. The Four Oaks Park, adjoining Sutton Park, formerly the\r\nproperty of a private gentleman, was bought by a company in June, 1879,\r\nfor the purpose of laying out a racecourse in this neighbourhood, of a\r\nsimilar nature to that of Ascot, and other great racing centres. In\r\naddition to the Hall, the buildings comprise a grand stand (the memorial\r\nstone of which was laid June 2, 1880), and a club stand, each 70ft. by\r\n66ft., with two galleries of seats refreshment, private, and other\r\nrooms. Also a second stand for the general public, 62ft. by 31ft. and a\r\npress and jockey stand, 53ft. by 31ft. The \"paddock\" occupies nearly\r\nthree acres, while an area of 115ft. by 72ft. is devoted to \"the Ring.\"\r\nThe cost of these various buildings and their necessary adjuncts is\r\nestimated at about £12,000, the structures themselves, which are built\r\nof red brick with stone facings, accommodating 3,000 persons. The course\r\nis about a mile and a half in circumference, and the \"straight\" about\r\nfive furlongs in length. The Park includes an area of 130 acres, and the\r\nfirst race was run March 1, 1881.--No steeplechases have been run on the\r\nold Wolverhampton course since 1855, and no flat races since Aug. 1877.\r\n\r\n_Running Records_.--Mr. W.G. George, of the Moseley Harriers, won a two\r\nmile handicap at Stamford Bridge, April 24, 1884, in 9 min. 17 2-5 secs.\r\nOn May 17, same year, he ran four miles, in 19 min. 39 4-5 secs. On July\r\n28 following, he covered, in the hour, 11 miles, 932 yds., 9 in., being\r\n37 yds. 2 ft. 3 in. less than the hitherto unsurpassed hour record of\r\nthe celebrated Deerfoot in 1862. Another of George's feats took place\r\nMay 1, 1882, when he ran ten miles in 52 min. 56-1/2 secs.\r\n\r\n_Skating Rinks_ were opened at the Lower Grounds May 1, 1875; at Bingley\r\nHall, Oct. 2, 1875; at Moseley, Dec. 6, 1876; and at Handsworth, Oct. 8,\r\n1877; and, for a time, the amusement was exceedingly popular, more than\r\none fortune accruing from the manufacture of patent and other roller\r\nskates. One of the most noteworthy feats on the slippery rinks was the\r\nskating of 200 miles in 24 hours by a Mr. F. Betteridge at Bingley Hall,\r\nAug. 20, 1878.\r\n\r\n_Swimming_.--The Birmingham Leander Club commenced their aquatic\r\nbrotherhood in June, 1877, and the members do themselves honour by\r\ngratuitously attending the public baths in the summer months to teach\r\nthe art of swimming to School Board youngsters. [See \"_Baths_,\"] The\r\ncelebrated swimmer, Captain Webb, who was drowned at Niagara, July 24,\r\n1883, visited this town several times, and the Athletic Club presented\r\nhim with a gold medal and purse December 4, 1875.\r\n\r\n~Statues, Busts, and Memorials.~--For many years it was sneeringly said\r\nthat Birmingham could afford but one statue, that of Nelson, in the Bull\r\nRing, but, as the following list will show, the reproach can no longer\r\nbe flung at us. Rather, perhaps, it may soon be said we are likely to be\r\nover-burdened with these public ornaments, though to strangers who know\r\nnot the peculiarities of our fellow-townsmen it may appear curious that\r\ncertain local worthies of the past have not been honoured in marble or\r\nbronze.\r\n\r\n_Attwood_.--The figure of Thomas Attwood, in Stephenson Place, New\r\nStreet, is the work of Mr. John Thomas, who did much of the carving at\r\nthe Grammar School. The cost was about £900, and the statue was unveiled\r\nJune 6, 1859.\r\n\r\n_Blue Coat Children_.--The stone figures of a Blue Coat boy and girl\r\nover the entrance to the School in St. Phillip's Churchyard, were\r\nsculptured by Mr. Edward Grubb, in 1770, and Hutton thought they were\r\nexecuted \"with a degree of excellence that a Roman statuary would not\r\nblush to own.\" In 1881 the appearance of the figures was _improved_ by\r\ntheir being painted in correct colours.\r\n\r\n_Bright_.--At the time of the Bright Celebration in 1883, the Birmingham\r\nLiberal Association commissioned Mr. A. Bruce Joy to execute for them a\r\nmarble statue of Mr. Bright, which the Association intend placing in the\r\nnew Art Gallery. The statue itself is expected to be finished in 1885,\r\nbut Mr. Bright has expressed his satisfaction with the model, which\r\nrepresents him standing erect in an attitude of dignified tranquility,\r\neasy and natural with his left hand in the breast of his coat, while the\r\nother hangs down by his side, emblematic of the Christian charity so\r\ncharacteristic of our distinguished representative.\r\n\r\n_Boulton_.--There is a fine bust of Matthew Bolton in Handsworth, and as\r\nthe owner of the great Soho Works certainly did much to advance the\r\nmanufactures of this town, foreigners have often expressed surprise that\r\nno statue has been erected to _his_ memory.\r\n\r\n_Buddha_.--The bronze statue of Buddha, now in Aston Hall, is supposed\r\nto be 2,500 years old, and was found buried among the ruins of a temple\r\nat Soottan, on the Ganges, Dec 6, 1862. It was presented to this town in\r\n1864 by Mr. Samuel Thornton.\r\n\r\n_Chamberlain, J_.--The memorial at the rear of the Town Hall bears the\r\nfollowing inscription:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"This memorial is created in gratitude for public service given to\r\n  this town by Joseph Chamberlain, who was elected town councillor in\r\n  November, 1869, Mayor in 1873, and resigned that office in June, 1876,\r\n  on being returned as one of the representatives of the borough of\r\n  Birmingham in Parliament, and during whose mayoralty many great works\r\n  were notably advanced, and mainly by whose ability and devotion the\r\n  gas and water undertakings were acquired for the town, to the great\r\n  and lasting benefit of the inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe memorial was desisigned by Mr. J.H. Chamberlain, of the firm of\r\nMartin and Chamberlain, and was presented to the town October 26, 1880,\r\nduring the mayoralty of Mr. Richard Chamberlain. The medallion of the\r\nright hon. gentleman is the work of Mr. Thomas Woolner, R.A.\r\n\r\n_Chamberlain, J.H._--The sum of £2,744 13s. 6d. raised by subscription\r\nfor the founding of a memorial of the late Mr. John Henry Chamberlain,\r\nwas given to the Midland Institute, with which the lamented gentleman\r\nwas so intimately connected.\r\n\r\n_Dawson_.--A public meeting was held Jan. 3, 1877, to decide on a\r\nmemorial of George Dawson, and the sum of £2,287 13s. 9d. was subscribed\r\nfor a statue to be erected at the rear of the Town Hall, but it was\r\nesteemed so poor a portrait that after a little while it was removed, in\r\nfavour of the present statue. A very pleasing bust, which is a very\r\nstriking likeness and really characteristic portrait was unveiled at the\r\nChurch of the Saviour, Aug. 8, 1882. It bears the following\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  IN LOVING MEMORY OF\r\n\r\n  GEORGE DAWSON, M.A.\r\n\r\n  Coming to this town in the year 1844, he gathered round him a band of\r\n  followers, who found in his teaching a fervent religious spirit, and a\r\n  fearless trust in God as our Heavenly Father, in union with an earnest\r\n  search after truth. To perpetuate such union they built this Church,\r\n  which he opened August 8. 1847, and in which he ministered until his\r\n  death. Not in this Church only, but throughout the land did he\r\n  everywhere teach to nations: that they are exalted by righteousness\r\n  alone--to men: \"To do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God.\"\r\n\r\n  He was born February 24. 1821, and died November 10, 1876.\r\n\r\n  \"I HAVE FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. T.J. Williamson, who executed this bust was entrusted with the order\r\nfor the new statue.\r\n\r\n_George IV_.--The first bronze statue ever cast in Birmingham was that\r\nof George IV., the work of Sir Edward Thomason, in 1823. Sir Edward\r\nemployed the best of talent and spared no pains to turn out a splendid\r\nwork of art, but he never found a customer for it. The statue is 6ft.\r\nhigh, weighing 2-1/2 tons, and costing over £1,500, but was sold in\r\nNovember, 1880, to a gentleman in the neighborhood for £150, little more\r\nthan the value of the metal.  _Goldsmith_.--The statue of Goldsmith, in\r\nthe hall of the Reference Library, is a plaster cast of the bronze\r\nstatue manufactured by Messrs. Elkington for the City of Dublin.\r\n_Hill_.--The sum of £1,500 was raised by public subscription, for the\r\npurpose of erecting a statue of Sir Rowland Hill. The work was executed\r\nin marble by Mr. P. Hollins, and pending the erection of the new Post\r\nOffice buildings, the charge of the statue was accepted by the Exchange\r\nBuildings Committee, September 12, 1870 and remained in the Birmingham\r\nExchange until the year 1874, when it was removed to the position in\r\nwhich it at present stands, in the corner of the principal room of the\r\nPost Office, Paradise Street.\r\n\r\n_Hill, M.D._--A very fine bust of Matthew Davenport Hill, the first\r\nRecorder for the borough, is placed in the Art Gallery at the Reference\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\n_James_.--A bust of the Rev. Angell James may be seen at Aston Hall.\r\n\r\n_King Edward VI._--When the old Grammar School was taken down the statue\r\nof the King, which had stood in its niche in the front of the old\r\nbuilding for generations, was broken to pieces on account of so many\r\ngentlemen (including governors) wanting it; as all could not have it, it\r\nwas destroyed!\r\n\r\n_Mason_.--The erection of a statue in his honour as proposed in 1870 not\r\nmeeting with the approval of Sir Josiah Mason (then Mr.), the Town\r\nCouncil paid Mr. E.G. Papworth, the chosen sculptor, a solatium or\r\nhonorarium of 150 guineas. The worthy knight not being now alive to veto\r\nthe project, a figure of him has been placed opposite the College in\r\nEdmund Street.\r\n\r\n_Murdoch_.--There is a bust of William Murdoch, the introducer of\r\ncoal-gas as an illuminant, in Handsworth Church. Another would not be\r\nout of place in the new Gas Office.\r\n\r\n_Nelson_--The bronze statue of Lord Nelson in the Bull Ring was executed\r\nby Westmacott, and uncovered June 6, 1809. The artist received £2,500,\r\nbut the total cost (raised by subscription) with the pedestal, lamps,\r\nand palisading, was nearly £3,000. The corner posts are old cannon from\r\nthe Admiral's ship the Victory.\r\n\r\n_Peel_.--The statue of Sir Robert Peel, near the Town Hall, cost £2,000,\r\nand was unveiled August 27, 1855. He faced towards Christ Church at\r\nfirst, and was protected from Tories and Protectionists by iron\r\nrailings, until March, 1878, when his bonds were loosed, and he was\r\nallowed to look down New Street.\r\n\r\n_Priestley_.--The statue of the discoverer of oxygen, near the Town\r\nHall, was uncovered August 1, 1884. The amount subscribed as a Priestley\r\nmemorial fund was £1,820, of which £972 went for the philosopher's stone\r\neffigy, about £10 for a tablet on the site of his house at Fair Hill,\r\nand £653 to the Midland Institute to found a scholarship in chemistry.\r\n\r\n_Prince Albert and the Queen_.--In 1862, after the death of the Prince\r\nConsort, a Memorial Committee was formed and a fund raised for a statue,\r\nthe execution of which was entrusted to Mr. Foley, and it is said to be\r\none of his finest productions. It was placed in the old Art Gallery, and\r\nuncovered August 27, 1863. It was in the reading-room at the time of the\r\nfire, but fortunately escaped injury. The balance of the fund was deemed\r\nsufficient for a companion statue of Her Majesty, and Mr. Foley received\r\nthe commission for it in 1871. At his death the order was given to Mr.\r\nWoolner, who handed over his work to the town in May, 1884, the ceremony\r\nof unveiling taking place on the 9th of that month. According to the\r\n_Athanæum_ it is \"one of the finest portrait statues of the English\r\nSchool, combining a severe yet elegant design with execution of the\r\nhighest kind, every element being thoroughly artistic.\" Thousands have\r\nseen it alongside the Prince's statue in the hall of the Reference\r\nLibrary, but few indeed have been heard to say they like it. Both\r\nstatues are ultimately intended to be placed in the Council House.\r\n\r\n_Rogers_.--A memorial bust of John Rogers, a native of Deritend, and one\r\nof the first martyrs of the Reformation, was unveiled in St. John's,\r\nOctober 29, 1883.\r\n\r\n_Scholefield_.--A bust of William Scholefield, M.P., for the borough, is\r\nat Aston Hall.\r\n\r\n_Sturge_.--The statue, and most appropriate memorial of Edmund Sturge,\r\nat the Five Ways, which cost about £1,000, was undraped June 4, 1862.\r\nMessrs. Bright and Scholefield, M.P.'s, being present.\r\n\r\n\r\n  With a true sorrow that rebuked all feigning,\r\n    By lone Edgbaston's side\r\n  Stood a great city in the sky's sad reigning\r\n    Bareheaded and wet-eyed.\r\n\r\n  Silent for once the restless hive of labour,\r\n    Save the low funeral tread,\r\n  Or voice of craftsman whispering to his neighbour\r\n    The good deeds of the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Timmins_.--An almost life-speaking marble bust of Mr. Sam. Timmins was\r\nplaced in the Reference Library, April 26, 1876. It was destroyed in the\r\nfire, but has been replaced, and few could tell the present bust is not\r\nthe original one.\r\n\r\n_Tyndale_.--The Londoners have honoured themselves by erecting on the\r\nThames Embankment a statue to the memory of the Reformer Tyndale, whom\r\nwe have partly to thank for the English version of the Bible. To help\r\npay for their ornament it was decided that the names of all towns\r\nsubscribing £100 or more should be inscribed on the pedestal, and the\r\nBible-lovers of Birmingham scraped together £86 15s. 3d. for the\r\npurpose, leaving the Mayor (Mr. Wm. White) to dip into his own pocket\r\nfor the remaining £13 4s. 9d.\r\n\r\n_Unett_.--The granite obelisk in St. Philip's churchyard, opposite\r\nTemple Street, was erected to the memory of Lieut. Colonel Unett, who\r\nfell at the storming of Sebastopol. It was uncovered June 19, 1857.\r\n\r\n_Watt_.--One of the finest productions of Francis Chantrey, the\r\nsculptor, is generally acknowledged to be the monument in Handsworth\r\nChurch to James Watt, which was placed there in September, 1827. The\r\nfigure is said to bear a very remarkable resemblance to Mr. Watt, who is\r\nrepresented seated in a Grecian chair, with compasses and open book, as\r\nthough tracing on the open page. On the front of the pedestal is\r\ninscribed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  JAMES WATT,\r\n  BORN\r\n  19 JANVARY,\r\n  1736.\r\n  DIED\r\n  23 AVGVST,\r\n  1819,\r\n  PATRI OPTIME MERITO.\r\n  E.M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statue in Ratcliffe Place was subscribed for in 1867, and the figure\r\nis very like the portrait of Watt. It was unveiled Oct. 2, 1868.\r\n\r\n_Whateley_.--A marble bust (by Peter Rollins) of J.W. Whateley, Esq.,\r\nM.D., was placed in the Board Room of the General Hospital, June 1,\r\n1877.\r\n\r\n_Wright_.--Mr. John Bright, June 15, 1883, uncovered the statue erected\r\nin memory of Mr. J.S. Wright, in front of the Council House. The\r\ninscription upon it is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"John Skirrow Wright, born February 2, 1822, died April 13, 1880. In\r\n  memory of the simplicity, kindliness, and integrity of his life and of\r\n  his unselfish, untiring, and patriotic devotion as a public man, this\r\n  monument is erected by the united gifts of all classes in the town he\r\n  loved and for which he laboured.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Steam Engines.~--The first steam engine (then called a fire engine)\r\nused for the purpose of pumping water from coal mines was put up in 1712\r\nby Newcomen and Calley, at a colliery near Wolverhampton, owned by Mr.\r\nBack, the ironwork, &c., being made in Birmingham, and taken hence to\r\nthe pit-head. The first of Watt's engines made at Soho, was to \"blow the\r\nbellows\" at John Wilkinson's ironworks at Broseley, in 1776. Watt's\r\nfirst pumping engine was started at Bloomfield Colliery, March 8, 1776.\r\nHaving overcome the rotary motion difficulties, Watt applied steam to\r\ntilt hammers and rolling mills in 1781, and to corn-grinding mills in\r\n1782; taking out patents in 1784 for the \"governor,\" \"parallel motion,\"\r\n&c., including also specifications for a travelling engine, though it\r\nwas William Murdoch who first made a practical working model of a\r\nlocomotive. The first engine worked by steam in this town that we have\r\nrecord of was put up at same works in Water Street, in 1760.\r\n\r\n~Steamships.~--If we do not build steamships in Birmingham, it was James\r\nWatt who proposed the use of screw propellers (in 1770); Wm. Murdoch,\r\nwho invented the oscillating cylinder (in 1785); Watt and Boulton, who\r\nfurnished engines (in 1807) for the first regular steam picket in\r\nAmerica; and James Watt, jun., who made the first steam voyage on the\r\nsea (October 14, 1817), crossing the Channel in the _Caledonia_, and\r\ntaking that vessel up the Rhine.\r\n\r\n~Stirchley Street~, about a mile and a quarter north-east of King's\r\nNorton, has a Post Office, a Police Station, a Board School, and a\r\nRailway Station. Notwithstanding these signs of modern civilisation, and\r\nthe near proximity of Cadbury's Cocoa Manufactory, Stirchley Street is,\r\nas it has been for many a generation, a favourite country outing place\r\nfor weary Brums having a chance hour to spend on change of scene.\r\n\r\n~Stocks.~--Putting people in the stocks appears to have been a very\r\nancient mode of punishment, for the Bible tells us that Jeremiah, the\r\nprophet, was put in the stocks by Pashur, and the gaoler who had charge\r\nof Paul and Silas at Philippi made fast their feet in a similar way.\r\nWhether Shakespeare feared the stocks when he refused to go back to\r\n\"drunken Bidford,\" after sleeping off the effects of one carouse with\r\nthe \"Sipper's Club\" there, is not chronicled, but that the stocks were\r\nnot unknown to him is evident by their being introduced on the stage in\r\n\"King Lear.\" The _Worcester Journal_ of Jan. 19, 1863, informs us that\r\n\"this old mode of punishment was revived at Stratford-on-Avon, for\r\ndrunkenness, and a passer-by asking a fellow who was doing penance how\r\nhe liked it, the reply was--'I beant the first mon as ever were in the\r\nstocks, so I don't care a fardin about it.\" Stocks used to be kept at\r\nthe Welsh Cross, as well as a pillory; and when the Corporation closed\r\nthe old prison in High Street, Bordesley, they took over the stocks\r\nwhich formerly stood alongside the whipping-post, on the bank in front\r\nof the present G.W.R. Station. The last date of this punishment being\r\ninflicted in this town is 1844, when the stocks were in the yard of the\r\nPublic Office in Moor Street.\r\n\r\n~Storms and Tempests.~--A great storm arose on Wednesday, November 24,\r\n1703, which lasted three days, increasing in force. The damage, all over\r\nthe kingdom, was immense; and at no period of English history has it\r\nbeen equalled. 15,000 sheep were drowned in one part of Gloucestershire.\r\nWe have no record of the immediately local loss.--In a storm on March 9,\r\n1778, the windmill at Holloway Head was struck by lightning, the miller\r\nwas hurt, and the sails shattered.--January 1, 1779, there was a violent\r\ngale, which, while it wrecked over 300 vessels on our coasts did great\r\ndamage as far inland as Birmingham--Snowstorms were so heavy on January\r\n23 and 24, 1814, that all communication between here and London was\r\nstopped for five days.--There was a strong gale September 26, 1853,\r\nduring which some damage was done to St. Mary's Church, to the alarm of\r\nthe congregation therein assembled.--A very heavy storm occurred June\r\n15, 1858, the day after the Queen's visit, lasting for nearly three\r\nhours, during which time three inches of rain fell, one half in twenty\r\nminutes.--Some property in Lombard Street was destroyed by lightning,\r\nJune 23, 1861; and parts of Aston, Digbeth, and the Parade were flooded\r\nsame time.--There was a terrific thunderstorm, August 26, 1867; the\r\nrainfall being estimated at seventy-two tons per acre.--During a heavy\r\nthunderstorm, June 17, 1875, the lightning set fire to a workshop in\r\nGreat Charles Street: killed a women in Deritend, and fourteen sheep and\r\nlambs at Small Heath.--In a heavy gale, January 30, 1877, a chimney\r\nstack was blown down in Jennen's Row, killing two men; and a wall was\r\nlevelled in Harborne Road, on February 20, another poor fellow losing\r\nhis life.--During the night of August 2 and 3, 1879 (when many parts of\r\nthe outskirts were flooded in comparatively the shortest time in\r\nmemory), the residence of W.E. Chance, Esq., Augustus Road, was struck\r\nby lightning, and considerable damage done; but no personal injuries\r\nwere reported.--During the storm of October 14, 1881, much local damage\r\nwas done, while round Coventry and Tamworth districts many hundreds of\r\ntrees were broken or uprooted. In Windsor Park, 960 trees were blown\r\ndown and more than a thousand damaged; 146 shipwrecks occurred on the\r\ncoasts.--During a gale December 11, 1883, a large stained glass window\r\nof St. Philip's Church was shattered; part of a house in Charles Henry\r\nStreet was blown down, two persons being killed; a child was killed at\r\nErdington, by chimney falling through roof, several persons had limbs\r\nfractured, and there was generally a great injury to property.--On\r\nSunday, June 15, 1884, St. Augustine's Church, Hagley Road, and the\r\nCongregational Chapel, Francis Road, were struck by lightning during a\r\ntempest, and the Chapel was somewhat injured.\r\n\r\n~Streets.~--It is not every street that is a street in Birmingham, for,\r\naccording to the Post Office Street List, besides a dozen or so to which\r\ndistinctive names have been given, like Cheapside, Deritend, Digbeth,\r\nHighgate, Islington, &c., and 726 streets called Streets, there are in\r\nthe borough 178 Roads, 86 Lanes, 69 Rows, 19 Squares, 11 Crescents, 2\r\nQuadrants, 5 Arcades, 1 Colonnade, 5 Parades, 484 Terraces, 1,572\r\nPlaces, 26 Passages, 20 Yards, 47 Courts (named, and twenty times that\r\nnumber numbered), 16 Mounts (twelve of them Pleasant), 24 Hills, 5\r\nVales, 2 Valleys, 23 Groves, 4 Retreats, 11 Villas, 14 Cottages, 2\r\nFive-Dwelling, 179 Buildings, 14 Chambers, 12 Walks, 4 Drives, 3\r\nAvenues, 5 Gullets, 1 Alley (and that is Needless), 1 Five-Ways,\r\n1 Six-Ways, 6 Greens, 2 Banks, 2 Villages, 3 Heaths, 3 Ends, and 1 No\r\nThoroughfare.\r\n\r\n~Sultan Divan.~--Formerly a questionable place of amusement in Needless\r\nAlley, but which was bought for £7,500, and opened by the Young Men's\r\nChristian Association, January 7, 1875.\r\n\r\n~Sunday in Birmingham.~--Sunday dogfights _have_ been heard of in this\r\ntown, but it was sixty years ago, when brutal sports of all kinds were\r\nmore rife than now. Prior to that, however, many attempts were made to\r\nkeep the Sabbath holy, for we read that in 1797 the heavy wagons then in\r\nuse for transport of goods were not allowed to pass through the town,\r\nthe authorities fining all offenders who were so wicked as to use their\r\nvehicles on the Lord's Day. The churchwardens were then supported by the\r\ninhabitants, who held several public meetings to enforce the proper\r\nobservance of the day, but there have been many changes since. In\r\nJanuary, 1856, a Sunday League, for opening museums, libraries, &c., on\r\nthe Sabbath, was started here. In the last session of Parliament in\r\n1870, there were eighteen separate petitions presented from this town\r\nagainst opening the British Museum on Sundays. The Reference Library and\r\nArt Gallery commenced to be opened on Sundays, April 28, 1872, and they\r\nare well frequented. Sunday labour in the local Post Offices was stopped\r\nAug. 10, 1873. In 1879 a society was formed for the purpose of\r\ndelivering lectures, readings, and addresses of an interesting nature,\r\non the Sunday evenings of the winter season, the Town Hall, Board\r\nSchools, and other public buildings being utilised for the purpose (the\r\nfirst being held in the Bristol Street Schools, Oct. 19, 1879), and very\r\npopular have they been, gentlemen of all sects and parties taking part,\r\nin the belief that\r\n\r\n\r\n  A Sabbath well spent\r\n  Brings a week of content.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1883, during an inquiry as to the extent of drunkenness on the\r\nSabbath, it was shown that the county of Warwick (including Birmingham)\r\nwas remarkably clear, as out of a population of 737,188 there had only\r\nbeen 348 convictions during 1882. For Staffordshire, with a population\r\nof 980,385, the convictions were 581. Northumberland, 687 convictions\r\nout of 434,074. Durham, 1,015 out of 867,586. Liverpool 1,741 out of\r\n552,425. Manchester, 1,429 out of 341,508.\r\n\r\n~Sutton Coldfield~, on the road to Lichfield, is celebrated even more\r\nfor its park than its antiquity. The former was left to the town by the\r\nBishop of Exeter (John Harman), otherwise known as Bishop Vesey, who was\r\na native of Sutton, and whose monument is still to be seen in the old\r\nChurch. He procured a charter of incorporation in 1528, and also founded\r\nthe Grammar School, and other endowed charities, such as the Almshouses,\r\nthe Poor Maidens' Portions, &c., dying in 1555, in his 103rd year.\r\nThirty years' back, the park contained an area of 2,300 acres, but a\r\nsmall part was sold, and the railways have taken portions, the present\r\nextent, park and pools, being estimated at 2,034 acres, the mean level\r\nof which is 410 feet above the sea level. A good length of Icknielde\r\nStreet, or the Old Roman Road, is distinctly traceable across a portion\r\nof the park. King John visited Sutton manor-house in April, 1208. On the\r\n18th of October, 1642, Charles I. reviewed his Staffordshire troops\r\nhere, prior to the battle of Edgehill, the spot being long known as \"The\r\nKing's Standing.\" The mill-dams at Sutton burst their banks July 24,\r\n1668, and many houses were swept away. The population is about 8,000,\r\nand the rateable value is put at £50,000, but as, through the attraction\r\nof the park, the town is a very popular resort, and is rapidly\r\nincreasing, it may ultimately become a place of importance, worthy of\r\nmunicipal honours, which are even now being sought. The number of\r\nvisitors to the park in the Whit-week of 1882, was 19,549; same week in\r\n1883, it was 11,378; in 1884, it was 17,486; of whom 14,000 went on the\r\nMonday.\r\n\r\n~Taxes.~--Would life be worth living if we had to pay such taxes as our\r\nfathers had to do? Here are a few:--The hearth or chimney tax of 2s. for\r\nevery fire-place or stove in houses rated above 20s. per annum was\r\nimposed in the fifteenth year of Charles II.'s reign, but repealed in\r\nthe first year of William and Mary, 1689; the owners of Edgbaston Hall\r\npaid for 22 chimneys before it was destroyed in 1668. In 1642, there was\r\na duty of £4 a pair on silk stockings. A window tax was enacted in 1695\r\n\"to pay for the re-coinage of the gold coin,\" and was not entirely\r\nremoved till July 24, 1851; from a return made to Parliament by the Tax\r\nOffice in 1781, it appeared that the occupiers of 2,291 houses paid the\r\nwindow tax in Birmingham; there was collected for house and window tax\r\nin 1823, from the inhabitants of this town, the sum of £27,459 12s.\r\n1-3/4d., though in the following year it was £9,000 less. Bachelors and\r\nwidowers were rated by 6 and 7 William III., c. 6, \"to enable the King\r\nto carry on the war against France with rigour.\" Births, marriages, and\r\ndeaths were also made liable to duties by the same Act. The salt duties\r\nwere first levied in 1702, doubled in 1732, and raised again in 1782,\r\nceasing to be gathered in 1825. The price of salt at one period of the\r\nlong Peninsular war rose to £30 per ton, being retailed in Birmingham at\r\n4l. per lb. Carriages were taxed in 1747. Armorial bearings in 1798.\r\nReceipts for money and promisory notes were first taxed in 1782. Hair\r\npowder tax, of 21s. per annum, was first levied in 1795. In 1827, there\r\nwas a 1s. 3d. duty on almanacks. The 3s. advertisement duty was reduced\r\nto 1s. 6d. in 1833, and abolished August 4, 1853. The paper duty, first\r\nput on in 1694, was repealed in 1861; that on bricks taken off in 1850;\r\non soap in 1853; on sugar in May, 1874, and on horses the same year.\r\nHats, gloves, and linen shirts were taxed in 1785; patent medicines,\r\ncompound waters, and codfish, in 1783; in fact every article of food,\r\ndrink, and clothing required by man from the moment of his birth until\r\nhis burial, the very shroud, the land he trod on, the house he lived in,\r\nthe materials for building, have all been taxed. For coming into the\r\nworld, for living in it, and for going out of it, have Englishmen had to\r\npay, even though they grumbled. Now-a-days the country's taxes are few\r\nin number, and per head are but small in amount, yet the grumbling and\r\nthe growling is as heavy as of old. _Can_ it arise from the pressure of\r\nour local rates? Where our fathers paid 20s. to the Government, we do\r\nnot pay 5s.; but where the old people gave 5s. in rates, we have to part\r\nwith 25s.\r\n\r\n~Telegraphs.~--The cable for the first Atlantic telegraph was made here.\r\nIts length was 2,300 nautical miles, and it required 690,000 lbs. of\r\ncopper in addition to the iron wire forming the strand, of which latter\r\nthere was about 16,000 miles' length. The first time the \"Queen's\r\nSpeech\" was transmitted to this town by the electric telegraph was on\r\nTuesday, November 30, 1847, the time occupied being an hour and a half.\r\nThe charge for sending a message of 20 words from here to London, in\r\n1848, was 6s. 6d. The Sub-Marine Telegraph Co. laid their wires through\r\nBirmingham in June and July, 1853.\r\n\r\n~Temperance.~--There appears to have been a sort of a kind of a\r\ntemperance movement here in 1788, for the Magistrates, at their sitting\r\nAugust 21, strongly protested against the increase of dram-drinking; but\r\nthey went on granting licenses, though. Father Matthew's first visit was\r\nSeptember 10, 1843; J.B. Gough's, September 21, 1853; Mr. Booth's, in\r\nMay, 1882. The first local society for inculcating principles of\r\ntemperance dates from September 1, 1830; U.K. Alliance organised a\r\nbranch here in February, 1855; the first Templars' Lodge was opened\r\nSeptember 8, 1868; the Royal Crusaders banded together in the summer of\r\n1881; and the Blue Ribbons were introduced in May, 1882. This novelty in\r\ndress ornamentation was adopted (so they said) by over 40,000\r\ninhabitants, but at the end of twelve months the count was reduced to\r\n8,000, including Sunday School children, popular parsons, maidens\r\nlooking for husbands, old maids who had lost their chances, and the\r\nunco' guid people, who, having lost their own tastes, would fain keep\r\nothers from their cakes and ale.\r\n\r\n~Temple Row.~--A \"parech meeting\" in 1715 ordered the purchase of land\r\nfor a passage way out of Bull Street to St. Philip's Church. It was not\r\nuntil 1842 when part of the Royal Hotel stables were taken down, that it\r\nwas made its present width. In 1837 the churchyard had some pleasant\r\nwalks along the sides, bounded by a low wooden fence, and skirted with\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n~Temple Street~ takes its name from the old summer arbour, wittily\r\ncalled \"the Temple,\" which once stood in a garden where now Temple Row\r\njoins the street. An advertisement in _Gazette_ of December 5, 1743,\r\nannounced a house for sale, in Temple Street, having a garden twelve\r\nyards wide by fifty yards long, adjoining the fields, and with a\r\nprospect of four miles distance.\r\n\r\n~Theatrical Jottings.~--What accommodation, if any, was provided here\r\nfor \"their majesties' servants,\" the playactors, in the times of Queen\r\nAnne and her successor, George I., is not known, but as Hutton tells us\r\nthat in 1730 the amusements of the stage _rose_ in elegance so far that\r\nthreepenny performances were given \"in a stable in Castle Street,\" we\r\nmay be sure the position held by members of the profession was not very\r\nhigh in the estimation of our townsfolk previous to that period. Indeed,\r\nit would almost seem as if the acting of plays was quite an innovation\r\nat the time named, and one that met with approval, for shortly after we\r\nread of there being theatres in Smallbrook Street, in New Street, and \"a\r\nnew theatre\" in Moor Street. The first-named closed in 1749 or 1750; the\r\nsecond is _supposed_ to have been on the site of the present Theatre\r\nRoyal, but it could not have been a building of much importance as we\r\nfind no note of it after 1744; the third, built in 1739, was taken\r\npossession of by the disciples of Wesley, and on March 21, 1764, was\r\nopened as a chapel. Previous to the last event, however, another theatre\r\nhad been erected (in 1752) in King Street, leading out of New Street,\r\nnear to the Free School, which, being enlarged in 1774, is described by\r\nHutton as having few equals. In this year also (1774) the Theatre Royal\r\nwas erected (at a cost of nearly £5,700) though the latter half of its\r\ntitle was not assumed until August, 1807, on the occasion of the Royal\r\nassent being given to the house being \"licensed.\" A bill had been\r\nintroduced into the House of Commons for this purpose on the 26th of\r\nMarch, 1777, during the debate on which Burke called Birmingham \"the\r\ngreat toyshop of Europe,\" but it was thrown out on the second reading.\r\nThe King Street Theatre, like its predecessor in Moor Street, after a\r\ntime of struggle, was turned into a place of worship in 1786, a fate\r\nwhich, at a later date, also befell another place of public\r\nentertainment, the Circus, in Bradford Street, and the theatrical\r\nhistory of the town, for a long term of years centred round the Theatre\r\nRoyal, though now and then spasmodic attempts were made to localise\r\namusements more or less of a similar nature. One of these, and the\r\nearliest, was peculiarly unfortunate; early in 1778 a wooden pavilion,\r\nknown as the \"Concert Booth,\" was erected in the Moseley Road, dramatic\r\nperformances being _given_ between the first and last parts of a vocal\r\nand instrumental concert, but some mischievous or malicious incendiary\r\nset fire to the building, which was burnt to the ground Aug. 13 of the\r\nsame year. Four years later, and nearly at the same date (Aug. 17) the\r\nTheatre in New Street met with a like fate, the only portion of it left\r\nbeing the stone front (added in 1780) which is still the same,\r\nfortunately coming almost as safely through the next conflagration. The\r\nproprietors cleared away the ruins, and erected a more commodious\r\nstructure, which, under the management of Mr. William Macready, was\r\nopened June 22, 1795. In the meantime, the King Street Theatre having\r\nbeen chapelised, the town appears to have been without any recognised\r\nplace for dramatic entertainments other than those provided in the large\r\nrooms of the hotels, or the occasional use of a granary transmogrified\r\nfor the nonce into a Thespian arena. On the night of the 6th of January,\r\n1820, after the performance of \"Pizarro,\" the Theatre Royal was again\r\nburnt out, but, possibly from having their property insured up to\r\n£7,000, the proprietors were not so long in having it rebuilt, the doors\r\nof the new house being opened on following Aug. 14. This is,\r\npractically, the same building as the present, which has scats for about\r\n3,500, the gallery holding 1,000. Many of the first artists of the\r\nprofession have trod the boards of the Old Theatre since the last-named\r\ndate, and Birmingham has cause to be proud of more than one of her\r\nchildren, who, starting thence, have found name and fame elsewhere. The\r\nscope of the present work will not allow of anything move than a few\r\nbrief notes, and those entirely of local bearing, but a history of the\r\nBirmingham stage would not be uninteresting reading.\r\n\r\nA wooden building in Moor Street, formerly a circus, was licensed March,\r\n19, 1861; closed in 1863, and cleared off the ground in 1865.\r\n\r\nTheatrical performances were licensed in Bingley Hall in 1854.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales Theatre, previously Broad Street Music Hall, was\r\nopened in 1862. It was reconstructed in 1876, and has accommodation for\r\nan audience of 3,200.\r\n\r\nThe Holte Theatre was opened May 12, 1879, the license to the Lower\r\nGrounds Co. being granted November 29, 1878.\r\n\r\nThe last new Theatre, the Grand, in Corporation Street, must rank as one\r\nof the handsomest edifices in the town. It faces what was once the Old\r\nSquare, and has a frontage of 120ft., the height to the cornice of the\r\nroof being 52ft., the whole being capped with a dome, supporting a\r\nwinged figure of Auroro, which, drawn in a car by prancing horses, is\r\n15ft. high. The interior is laid out in the most improved modern style,\r\nornately decorated throughout, and provides accommodation for over 3,000\r\npersons. The cost is put at £30,000, of which £17,000 went to the\r\nbuilders alone, and the theatre is the property of Mr. A. Melville. The\r\nopening day was Nov. 14th, 1883.\r\n\r\nThe \"Interlude of Deritend Wake, with the representation of a\r\nBull-baiting\" was part of the performance announced at the King street\r\nTheatre, May 31, 1783.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sarah Siddons, whose _début_ in London the previous season had been\r\nanything but successful, came to Birmingham for the summer season of\r\n1776. Henderson, one of her colleagues here, notwithstanding the Drury\r\nLane veto, declared that she was \"an actress who never had an equal nor\r\nwould ever have a superior\"--an opinion quickly verified.\r\n\r\nOne of Kean's benefits was a total failure. In the last scene of the\r\nplay \"A New Way to Pay Old Debts,\" wherein allusion is made to the\r\nmarriage of a lady, \"Take her,\" said Kean, \"and the Birmingham audience\r\ninto the bargain.\"\r\n\r\nGarrick was visiting Lord Lytton at Hagley on one occasion when news was\r\nbrought that a company of players were going to perform at Birmingham.\r\nHis lordship suggested that Garrick should write an address to the\r\naudience for the players. \"Suppose, then,\" said he, \"I begin thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Ye sons of iron, copper, brass and steel,\r\n   Who have not heads to think, nor hearts to feel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried his lordship, \"if you begin like that, they will hiss the\r\nplayers off the stage, and pull the house down.\" \"My lord,\" replied\r\nGarrick, \"what is the use of an address if it does not come home to the\r\nbusiness and bosoms of the audience?\"\r\n\r\nA \"Birmingham Garrick,\" was the name given to an actor named Henderson\r\n(1782), whose friends did not think him quite so great a tragedian as he\r\nfancied himself.\r\n\r\nKemble made his last appearance on the Birmingham stage July 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nRobinson Crusoe, or Harlequin Friday, was the pantomime in 1790.\r\n\r\nMadame Catalini first appeared at Royal in 1807.\r\n\r\nIncledon, the famous tenor, sang here first time in same year.\r\n\r\nWilliam Charles Macready made his _debût_ on the stage of the Royal as\r\n_Romeo_, June 7, 1810. He took his farewell benefit Aug. 13, 1871.\r\n\r\nAlfred Bunn had the Theatre in 1823, during which year there appeared\r\nhere Mr. and Mrs. C. Kemble, W.C. Macready, Joey Grimaldi, Miss Ellen\r\nTree (afterwards Mrs. Charles Kean), W. Farrer, Braham, Elliston,\r\nDowton, Rignold and Power.\r\n\r\nBarry Sullivan was born here in 1824.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 the whole town was up in arms taking part in the \"Battle of the\r\nPreachers and the Players,\" which was commenced by the Rev. J. Augell\r\nJames delivering a series of sermons bitterly inveighing against the\r\ntheatre, as a place of amusement, and pouring forth the most awful\r\ndenunciations against the frequenters thereof. Alfred Bunn, the manager,\r\nwas not slow to retort. He put \"The Hypocrite\" on the boards, Shuter,\r\nthe clever comedian and mimic, personating Mr. James in the part of\r\n_Mawworm_ so cleverly that the piece had an immense run. The battle\r\nended in a victory for both sides, chapel and theatre alike being\r\ncrammed. If it pleased the godly it was a god-send for Bunn whose\r\nexchequer it filled to repletion.\r\n\r\nSigner Costa was at the Festival in 1829, and he afterwards appeared on\r\nthe stage at the Royal.\r\n\r\nPaganini first fiddled at the Royal, January 22, 1832.\r\n\r\nSheridan Knowles, Macready, Paganini, Matthews, and Miss Ellen Tree were\r\namong the Stars at the Royal in 1833.\r\n\r\nMercer H. Simpson took the management of the Royal in 1838. His farewell\r\nbenefit was on December 16, 1864, and he died March 2, 1877, aged 76.\r\n\r\nSims Reeves' first visit to this town was in May, 1843; his last\r\nappearance at the Festivals was in 1873; at the Royal in May, 1875, and\r\nat the Town Hall, March 25, 1884.\r\n\r\nJenny Lind first sang here Aug. 29, 1847; she sang for the Queen's\r\nHospital at Town Hall, Dec. 28, 1848; her last concerts were Jan. 22-23,\r\n1862.\r\n\r\nMadle. Rachael first played here Aug. 19, 1847.\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens and his amateur friends gave their special performances\r\nin aid of the Shakespeare House Fund, at the Royal, June 6 and 27, 1848,\r\nthe receipts amounting to £589.\r\n\r\nVariety was not wanting at our New Street Theatre in 1852. Among the\r\nartistes advertised to appear were: A strong Man who had 5 cwt. of stone\r\nbroken (by a sledge hammer) on his chest nightly; performing Dogs and\r\nHorses; Madame Grisi, Signor Mario, Haymarket Company, Benjamin Webster,\r\nand Madame Celeste, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nMiss Menken, the female _Mazeppa_, appeared at Prince of Wales', May 15\r\n1865, and at the Royal in Nov. 1807.\r\n\r\nMiss Neilson's first appearance here was in Nov. 1868, in an adaptation,\r\nby Mr. C. Williams, a local dramatist, of Miss Braddon's \"Captain of the\r\nVulture.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Irving first appeared as _Hamlet_ in this town at Prince of Wales',\r\nDec., 1877.\r\n\r\nSarah Bernhardt was at Prince of Wales', July 4-6, 1881.\r\n\r\nKyrle Beilew last appeared here at Prince of Wales', Sept, 17, 1881.\r\n\r\nMrs. Langtry was at Prince of Wales', May 29, 1882.\r\n\r\nEdwin Booth's first appearance here was at the Royal, as _Richelieu_,\r\nDec. 11, 1882.\r\n\r\nBobby Atkins, whose real name was Edward, was the most popular comedian\r\nof the Royal, with which he had been connected for more than twenty-five\r\nyears. He died in 1882, in his 64th year. His bosom friend, John Barton,\r\nmade his exit from the world's stage April 16, 1875.\r\n\r\nSir. George Rignold's mother is stated by Mr. Thomas Swinbourne (himself\r\na native) to have been a leading actress of the Theatre Royal and very\r\npopular, as indeed she would necessarily be, her _role_ of parts\r\nincluding _Hamlet_ and _Virginius_. The father was, says Mr. S., \"an\r\nadmirable terpsichorean artiste, and George inherits the talents of both\r\nparents, with a dash of music besides, for, like _William_, in\r\n'Black-eyed Susan,' he 'plays on the fiddle like on angel.'\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three of our places of amusement have been turned into chapels\r\npermanently, and therefore it was hardly a novelty to hold \"Gospel\r\nservices\" in the Prince of Wales's Theatre, October 3, 1875, but it was\r\nto their credit that \"the gods\" behaved themselves.\r\n\r\n~Time.~--When it is exactly twelve at noon here in Birmingham, it is\r\n7min. 33secs. past at Greenwich, 12min. 50secs. past at Dover, and\r\n16min. 54secs. past at Paris; while it wants 1-1/2mins. to the hour at\r\nManchester, 9-1/2min. at Glasgow, 17min. 50secs. at Dublin, and\r\n26-1/2mins. at Cork. At Calcutta, the corresponding time would be\r\n6.1-1/2 p.m., Canton 7.40 p.m., Japan 9.15 p.m., Mexico 5.34 a.m., New\r\nOrleans 8.5 a.m., New York 7.11 a.m., New Zealand 11.45 p.m., Nova\r\nScotia 7.55 a.m., San Francisco 4.5 a.m., St., Petersburg 2.10 p.m.,\r\nSydney 10.12 p.m., and at Washington just seven o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n~Tithes.~--One hundred and fifty years ago (if not, considerably later)\r\nthe Rector of St. Martin's was paid tithes in cash based on the value of\r\nthe crops, &c., one acre of good wheat being tithed at 7s. 6d.; an acre\r\nof good barley at 4s. 4-1/2d.; an acre of flax and hemp, if pulled, at\r\n5s.; an acre of good oats, peas, or potatoes, and all kinds of garden\r\nstuff at 3s. 9d.; for meadow land 4d. an acre, and 2d. for leasow (or\r\nleasland); 3d. being claimed for cow and her calf. 1-1/2d. for each\r\nlamb, &c. In course of time these payments were changed into a fixed\r\ntithe rent, but before matters were comfortably settled, the Rector\r\nfound it necessary to give notice (April, 1814) that he should enforce\r\nthe ancient custom of being paid \"in kind.\" The gun trade was brisk at\r\nthat time, but whether the reverend gentleman took his tenths of the\r\nguns, what he did with them, or how the parties came to terms is not\r\nrecorded.--The tithes formerly due in kind to the Vicar of Edgbaston\r\nwere commuted by Act passed June 8, 1821, into art annual \"corn rent,\"\r\npayable by the occupiers or all kinds in the parish.\r\n\r\n~Tower.~--Originally, all guns made here for Government, had to be put\r\ntogether in London, but when the French Revolution broke out, it was\r\nseen that a quicker mode of procedure was necessary, and an\r\nestablishment in Bagot Street was erected in 1798, where all guns for\r\nGovernment were viewed and stamped with the \"Tower\" mark. Hence the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n~Town Criers~ were first appointed in 1526. Jacob Wilson entered into\r\noffice May 4, 1853, and was pensioned off with 15s. a week in August,\r\n1879, after a family tenure of the office, according to Jacob, of about\r\n350 years. Surely it was a crying shame to stop the children of that\r\nfamily from crying in the future. The last of the criers did not last\r\nlong after deposition from office, Jacob's last words being uttered in\r\n1881.\r\n\r\n~Town Improvements.~--Some fifty and odd years ago Dobbs, a local\r\ncomedian, used to sing,\r\n\r\n  \"Brumagem has altered so,\r\n  There's scarce a place in it I know;\r\n  Round the town you now must go\r\n  To find old Brumagem.\"\r\n\r\nHad he lived till these days he might well have sung so, for\r\nimprovements are being carried out so rapidly now that in another\r\ngeneration it is likely _old_ Birmingham will have been improved off the\r\nface of the earth altogether. Prior to the days of steam, our\r\nforefathers went about their work more leisurely, for it was not until\r\n1765 that the Act was obtained for the \"enlightening\" of the streets,\r\nand four years later when the first Act was passed (April 21, 1769) for\r\nstreet improvements. The Street Commissioners appointed by this Act, and\r\nwho held their first meeting May 22, 1769, for many years did little\r\nmore than regulate the traffic of the streets, keep them clean_ish_, and\r\nlook after the watchmen. In course of time the operations of the said\r\nCommissioners were extended a little, and it is to them that we owe the\r\nexistence of the central open space so long known as the Bull Ring, for\r\nthey gave £1,730, in 1801, for the removal of nine tenements there and\r\nthen blocking the way. Money must have been of more value then than now,\r\nfor if such a purchase was necessary at the present date one or two more\r\nfigures would require being added to the amount. This town improvement\r\nwas completed in 1806, when the Commissioners purchased the remaining\r\nhouses and shops round St. Martin's, but property owners had evidently\r\nlearned something during the five years, for whereas the Commissioners\r\nat first estimated the further cost at £10,957, they reluctantly had to\r\nprovide no less than £22,266, the additional sum required being\r\nswallowed up by \"incidental expenses.\" The poet already quoted had\r\napparently been absent during these alterations, for he wailingly\r\nbemoaned--\r\n\r\n  \"Poor old Spiceal Street half gone,\r\n  The poor old Church stands all alone,\r\n  And poor old I can only groan,\r\n  That I can't find Brumagem.\"\r\n\r\nThough an Improvement Act for Duddeston and Nechells was obtained in\r\n1829, the town improvements for the next forty years consisted\r\nprincipally of road making, street paving, market arranging, &c., the\r\nopening-up ideas not getting well-rooted in the minds of our governors\r\nuntil some time after the Town Council began to rule the roast. That a\r\ngreat deal of work _was_ being done, however, is shown by reference to\r\nthe Borough accounts for 1840, in which year £17,366 was expended in\r\nlighting, watching, and otherwise improving the thoroughfares, in\r\naddition to £13,794 actually spent on the highways. 1852 saw the removal\r\nof the turnpikes, at a cost of over £3,200; in the same year £5,800 was\r\nexpended in widening the entrance to Temple Row from Bull Street, and\r\n£1,800 for rounding off the corner of Steelhouse Lane and Snow Hill. In\r\nOctober, 1853, it was decided to obtain for £33,000 the 11,540 square\r\nyards of land at the corner of Ann Street and Congreve Street, where the\r\nMunicipal Buildings, Art Gallery, and new Gas Office now stand. Almost\r\nevery year since has seen the purchase of properties more or less\r\nrequired for substantial improvements, though some of them may not even\r\nyet have been utilised. A few fancy prices might be named which have had\r\nto be paid for odd bits of property here and there, but about the\r\ndearest of all was £53 10s. per yard, which the Council paid (in 1864)\r\nfor the land required to round off the corner of New Street and\r\nWorcester Street, a further £1,300 going, in 1873, to extinguish certain\r\nleasehold rights. This is by no means the highest figure given for land\r\nin the centre of the town, as Mr. John Feeney, in 1882, paid at the rate\r\nof £66 per yard for the site at corner of Cannon Street and New Street,\r\nthe portion retained for his own use costing him even more than that, as\r\nhe generously allowed the Corporation to take 30-1/2 yards for £1,000.\r\nThe introduction of the railways, and consequent obliteration of scores\r\nof old streets, courts, alleys, and passages, has been of vast service\r\ntowards the general improvement of the town, as well in the matter of\r\nhealth and sanitation, as leading to the construction of many new\r\nbuildings and the formation of adequate approaches to the several\r\nrailway stations, the erection of such establishments as the Queen's\r\nHotel, the Great Western Hotel, &c. Nor have private property owners and\r\nspeculators been at all backward, as evidenced by our magnificent modern\r\nbanking establishments, the huge piles of commercial buildings in\r\nColmore Row, New Street, and Corporation Street, the handsome shops in\r\nNew Street, High Street, and Bull Street, with many other edifices that\r\nour grandfathers never dreamed of, such as the Midland, the Grand, and\r\nthe Stork Hotels, the palatial Club Houses, the Colonnade and Arcades,\r\nNew Theatres, Inns of Court, &c., &c. Many of these improvements have\r\nresulted from the falling-in of long leases on the Colmore, the Grammar\r\nSchool, and other estates, while others have been the outcome of a\r\nfar-seeing policy on the part of such moneyed men as the late Sir Josiah\r\nMason, Isaac Horton, and others of somewhat similar calibre. Going away\r\nfrom the immediate centre of the town architectural improvements will be\r\nnoted on all hands, Snow Hill, for one place, being evidently in the\r\nregenerative throes of a new birth, with its Gothic Arcade opposite the\r\nrailway station, and the new circus at the foot of the hill, where for\r\nso many long years there has been nothing but a wreck and a ruin. In\r\nclose neighbourhood, Constitution Hill, Hampton Street, and at the\r\njunction of Summer Lane, a number of handsome houses and shops have\r\nlately been erected by Mr. Cornelius Ede, in the early Gothic style,\r\nfrom designs by Mr. J.S. Davis, the architect of the Snow Hill Arcade,\r\nthe whole unquestionably forming a very great advance on many former\r\nstreet improvements. The formation in 1880 of John Bright Street as an\r\nextension of the Bristol Road (cost £30,000) has led to the erection of\r\nmany fine buildings in that direction; the opening-out of Meetinghouse\r\nYard and the alterations in Floodgate Street (in 1879, at a cost of\r\n£13,500), has done much for that neighbourhood; the widening of\r\nWorcester Street and the formation of Station Street, &c., thanks to the\r\nenlargement of the Central Station, and the remodelling of all the\r\nthoroughfares in the vicinity of Navition Street and Worcester Wharf,\r\nalso arising therefrom, are important schemes now in progress in the\r\nsame direction; and in fact there is hardly any district within the\r\nborough boundaries in which improvements of more or less consequence are\r\nnot being made, or have been planned, the gloomy old burial grounds\r\nhaving been turned into pleasant gardens at a cost of over £10,000, and\r\neven the dirty water-courses known as the river Rea and Hockley brook\r\nhave had £12,000 worth of cleaning out bestowed upon them. It is not too\r\nmuch to say that millions have been spent in improving Birmingham during\r\nthe past fifty years, not reckoning the cost of the last and greatest\r\nimprovement of all--the making of Corporation Street, and the consequent\r\nalterations on our local maps resulting therefrom. The adoption of the\r\nArtizans' Dwelling Act, under the provisions of which the Birmingham\r\nImprovement Scheme has been carried out, was approved by the Town\r\nCouncil, on the 16th of October, 1875. Then, on the 15th of March, 1876,\r\nfollowed the Local Government Board enquiry; and on the 17th of June,\r\n1876, the provisional order of the Board, approving the scheme, was\r\nissued. The Confirming Act received the Royal assent on the 15th of\r\nAugust, 1876. On the 6th of September, 1880, a modifying order was\r\nobtained, with respect to the inclusion of certain properties and the\r\nexclusion of others. The operations under the scheme began in August,\r\n1878, when the houses in New Street were pulled down. In April, 1879, by\r\nthe removal of the Union Hotel, the street was continued into Cherry\r\nStreet: and further extensions have been made in the following order:--\r\nCherry Street to Bull Street, August 1881; the Priory to John Street,\r\nJune 1881; Bull Street to the Priory, January, 1882; John Street to\r\nAston Street, February, 1882. Little Cannon Street was formed in August\r\n1881; and Cowper Street in January, 1881. The first lease of land in the\r\narea of the scheme--to the Women's Hospital--was agreed upon in January,\r\n1876; and the first lease in Corporation Street--to Mr. J.W. Danieli--\r\nwas arranged in May, 1878. In July, 1879, a lease was agreed upon for\r\nthe new County Court. The arbitrations in the purchase of properties\r\nunder the scheme were begun in June, 1879, and in June, 1880, Sir Henry\r\nHunt, the arbitrator nominated by the Local Government Board, made his\r\nfirst award, amounting to £270,405, the remainder of the properties\r\nhaving been bought by agreement. The loans borrowed on account of the\r\nscheme amount to £1,600,000, the yearly charge on the rates being over\r\n£20,000 per annum, but as the largest proportion of the property is let\r\nupon 75-year leases, this charge will, in time, not only be reduced\r\nyearly by the increase of ground-rents, as the main and branch streets\r\nare filled up, but ultimately be altogether extinguished, the town\r\ncoming in for a magnificent income derived from its own property. The\r\nlength of Corporation Street from New Street to Lancaster Street is 851\r\nyards, and if ultimately completed (as at first intended) from Lancaster\r\nStreet to Aston Road, the total length will be 1,484 yards or\r\nfive-sixths of a mile. The total area of land purchased for the\r\ncarrying-out of the scheme is put at 215,317 square yds. (about 44a. 1r.\r\n38p.), of which quantity 39,280 square yards has been laid out in new\r\nstreets, or the widening of old ones. Of the branch or connecting\r\nstreets intended there is one (from Corporation Street to the corner of\r\nHigh Street and Bull Street, opposite Dale End), that cannot be made for\r\nseveral years, some valuable leases not expiring until 1890 and 1893,\r\nbut, judging by the present rate of building, Corporation Street itself\r\nwill be completed long before then. More than a score of the\r\nunhealthiest streets and lanes in the town have been cleared away, and\r\nfrom a sanitary point of view the improvement in health and saving of\r\nlife in the district by the letting in of light and air, has been of the\r\nmost satisfactory character, but though the scheme was originated under\r\nthe Artisans' Dwelling Act, intended to provide good and healthy\r\nresidences in lieu of the pestiferous slums and back courts, it cannot\r\nin one sense be considered much of a success. The number of artisans'\r\ndwellings required was 1,335, about 550 of which were removed\r\naltogether, the rest being improved and relet, or converted into shops,\r\nwarehouses, &c. A piece of land between Newtown Row and Summer Lane,\r\ncontaining an area of 14,250 square yards was purchased for the purpose\r\nof leasing for the erection of artisans' dwellings, and a 50ft. wide\r\nstreet was laid out and nicely planted with trees, but, owing either to\r\nthe badness of trade, or the over-building of small houses in other\r\nparts previously, less than a sixth of the site has been taken, and but\r\na score of houses built, a most wonderful contrast to the rapid filling\r\nof Corporation Street with its many magnificent edifices present and\r\nprospective, that promise to make it one of the finest streets in the\r\nprovinces. There cannot, however, be such necessity for the erection of\r\nsmall houses as was imagined when the Act was adopted here, for\r\naccording to a return lately obtained, and not reckoning the thousands\r\nof little domiciles on the outskirts, there are in the borough 4,445\r\nhouses usually let at weekly rentals up to 2s. 6d. per week, 24,692 the\r\nrentals of which are between 2s. 6d. and 3s. 6d., and 36,832 others\r\nbetween 3s. 6d. and 7s. per week, a total of 65,969 working men's\r\nhouses, but of which 5,273 (taking one week with another) are always\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\n~Toyshop of Europe.~--It was during the debate in the House of Commons\r\n(March 26, 1777) on the first reading of a Bill to license the Theatre\r\nin Birmingham, that Mr. Burke, who spoke in its favour, described this\r\ntown as \"the great toyshop of Europe.\" At that time, and for long\r\nafterwards, hundreds of articles of utility manufactured here were\r\nroughly classed as \"light steel toys,\" and \"heavy steel toys;\" though we\r\nshould hardly now be likely to consider tinder boxes, steelyards,\r\npokers, fire-shovels and tongs as playthings.\r\n\r\n~Trade Notes of the Past.~--Foreigners were not allowed to carry on any\r\nretail trade here before 1663. The Brums never liked them. An official\r\ndocument of 1695, states that, the trade of the town was \"chiefly in\r\nsteel, iron, and other _ponderous_ commodities.\" In 1702 it was enacted\r\nthat if brass, copper, latten, bell-metal gun-metal, or shruff-metal be\r\ncarried beyond sea, clean or mixed, double the value thereof to be\r\nforfeited, tin and lead only excepted. An Act was passed March 20, 1716,\r\nprohibiting trade with Sweden, much to the inconvenience of our local\r\nmanufacturers, who imported Swedish iron for conversion into steel in\r\nlarge quantities. The Act 1 Geo. I., c. 27 (1720), forbidding the\r\n_exportation_ of artizans to foreign countries was not repealed till\r\n1825 (5 Geo. IV., c. 97). In April, 1729, our manufacturers petitioned\r\nthat the colonists in America should be encouraged to send pig iron over\r\nhere; ten years previously they bitterly opposed the idea; ten years\r\nlater they repented, for their American cousins filled our warehouses\r\nwith their manufactured goods. In 1752 it was stated that above 20,000\r\nhands were employed here in \"useful manufactures.\" In 1785 a reward of\r\nfifty guineas was offered here for the conviction of any person\r\n\"enticing workmen to go to foreign countries;\" the penalty for such\r\n\"enticing\" being a fine of £100 and three months' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n~Trade Societies and Trades' Unions~ are of modern growth, unless we\r\ncount the old-style combinations of the masters to prevent their workmen\r\nemigrating, or the still more ancient Guilds and Fraternities existing\r\nin mediæval times. There are in all, 177 different Trades' Unions in the\r\ncountry (coming under the notice of the Registrar-General), and most of\r\nthem have branches in this town and neighbourhood. The majority have\r\nsick and benefit funds connected with them, and so far should be classed\r\namong Friendly, Benevolent, or Philanthropic Societies, but some few are\r\nplainly and simply trade associations to keep up prices, to prevent\r\ninterference with their presumed rights, to repress attacks by the\r\navoidance of superabundant labour, and to generally protect members when\r\nwrongfully treated, cheated or choused. Prior to 1834, when some 20,000\r\npersons assembled on Newhall Hill, March 31 to protest against the\r\nconviction of Dorset labourers for trades' unionism, few of these\r\nsocieties were locally in existence; but the advent of Free Trade seems\r\nto have shown all classes of workers the necessity of protecting their\r\nindividual interests by means of a system of Protection very similar,\r\nthough on smaller scale, to that abolished by Sir Robert Peel and his\r\nfriends. That there was a necessity for such trade societies was clearly\r\nshown by the harsh manner in which they were denounced by John Bright at\r\na Town Hall banquet, held April 28, 1875, that gentleman evidently\r\ndemurring to the anomally of working men being Protectionists of any\r\nkind. Foremost among the local unions is the National Society of\r\nAmalgamated Brassworkers, originated April 18, 1872 with over 5,000\r\nmembers now on its books, having in its first eight years subscribed and\r\npaid to members out of employ no less than £29,000.--The Builders'\r\nLabourers combined in 1861, and pay out yearly over £200 for sick and\r\nfuneral benefits.--The National Association of Master Builders was\r\norganised here on Dec, 18, 1877.--The Butcher's Trade and Benevolent\r\nAssociation, organised in 1877, helps its members in case of need, keeps\r\na sharp look out when new Cattle Markets, &c., are proposed, and\r\nprovides a jury to help the magistrates in any doubtful case of\r\n\"scrag-mag,\" wherein horse-flesh, donkey meat, and other niceties have\r\nbeen tendered to the public as human food.--The \"gentlemen\" belonging to\r\nthe fraternity of accountants met on April 20, 1882, to form a local\r\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants, and their clients know the result by\r\nthe extra charges of the chartered ones.--The Clerks' Provident\r\nAssociation provides a register for good clerks out of employ for the\r\nuse of employers who may want them, and, of course, there can be no good\r\nclerks out of employ except those who belong to the Association. It was\r\ncommenced in 1883, from a philanthropic feeling, but must rank among\r\ntrade societies as much as many others.--The Coal Merchants and\r\nConsumers' Association, for regulating the traffic charges, and\r\notherwise protecting the trade (especially the sellers) was organised in\r\n1869.--The Dairymen and Milksellers' Protection Society came into\r\nexistence April 2, 1884, and is intended to protect the dealers against\r\nthe encroachments of the Birmingham Dairy Company, and all customers\r\nfrom the cows with wooden udders or iron teats.--The dentists in May,\r\n1883, held the first meeting of the Midland Odentological Society, but\r\nit is not expected that the people at large will be entirely protected\r\nfrom toothache earlier than the first centenary of the Society.--The\r\nInstitution of Mechanical Engineers was formed early in 1847.--The\r\nAmalgamated Society of Engineers dates half-a-century back, its 430\r\nbranches having collectively about 50,000 members, with a reserve fund\r\nof £178,000, though the expenditure in 1883 was £124,000 out of an\r\nincome of £134,000. Locally, there are three branches, with 765 members,\r\nhaving balances in hand of £2,075; the expenditure in 1883 being £680 to\r\nmen out of work, £585 to sick members, £390 to the superannuated, £171\r\nfor funerals, and £70 in benevolent gifts.--The Birmingham and Midland\r\nCounties Grocers' Protection and Benevolent Association, started in\r\n1871, has a long name and covers a considerable area. It was designed to\r\nmake provision for the wives and families of unfortunate members of the\r\ntrade when in distress; to defend actions brought against them under the\r\nAdulteration Acts; and most especially to protect themselves from the\r\nencroachments of the merchants, importers, and manufacturers, who do not\r\nalways deliver 112 lbs. to the cwt, or keep to sample.--The Licensed\r\nVictuallers first clubbed together for protection in 1824, and the\r\nRetail Brewers and Dealers in Wine followed suit in 1845, both societies\r\nspending considerable sums yearly in relief for decayed members of the\r\ntrade, the Licensed Victuallers having also a residential Asylum for a\r\nnumber of their aged members or their widows in Bristol Road.--The\r\njourneymen printers opened a branch of the Provincial Typographical\r\nAssociation Oct. 12, 1861, though there was a society here previously.--\r\nThe first local union we find record of was among the knights of the\r\nthimble, the tailors striking for an increase in wages in 1833; a branch\r\nof the Amalgamated Society of Tailors has lately been organised.--In\r\n1866 a general Trades' Council was formed, which utilises by combined\r\naction the powers of the whole in aid of any single society which may\r\nstand in need of help.\r\n\r\n~Trades and Manufactures.~--There are no published returns of any kind\r\nthat have ever been issued by which more than a guess can be made at the\r\nreal value of the trade of Birmingham, which varies considerably at\r\ntimes. At the present moment (March, 1885) trade is in a _very_\r\ndepressed state, and it would hardly be correct to give the exact\r\nfigures, were it even possible to obtain them, and any statistics that\r\nmay appear in the following lines must be taken as showing an average\r\nbased upon several years. Speaking at a council meeting, February 19,\r\n1878, Mr. Alderman Joseph Chamberlain said the best way to ascertain the\r\ntrade of the town was to take the local bank returns and the railway\r\ntraffic \"in\" and \"out,\" so far as the same could be ascertained. The\r\ndeposits in all the banks that published returns were, at the end of\r\n1877, £10,142,936, as against £10,564,255 in the previous year--a\r\nfalling off of £421,312, or 4 percent. With regard to bills of exchange\r\nheld by the banks, the amount was £3,311,744, against £3,605,067 in the\r\nprevious year--a falling off of £293,323, or 8 per cent. The amount of\r\nthe advances, however, was £6,041,075, as against £5,570,920 in the\r\nprevious year--an increase of £470,155, or 8-1/2 percent. With regard to\r\nthe trade of the town, by the courtesy of the managers of the respective\r\ncompanies, he was able to give the numbers of tons of goods, of coals,\r\nand other minerals, the loads of cattle, and the number of passengers.\r\nThe tons of goods were 973,611, as against 950,042 in 1876--an increase\r\nof 23,569 tons, or about 2-1/2 per cent. The tons of coal were 566,535,\r\nagainst 575,904--a falling off of 9,372 tons, or 1-1/2 percent. The\r\nother minerals were 119,583 tons, against 100,187--an increase of\r\n19,369, or 19 per cent. The loads of cattle were 22,462 last year,\r\nagainst 19,157 in the previous year--an increase of 3,305 loads, 17 per\r\ncent. These were the returns of the \"in\" and \"out\" traffic. The number\r\nof passengers was 5,787,616 in 1877, against 5,606,331--an increase of\r\n181,285, or about 3-1/4 per cent. So far as the traffic went, as they\r\nhad been led to expect from the Board of Trade returns, there had been\r\nan increase of business, but a decrease of profits; and as to the\r\ndecrease of profits he had some figures which showed that the profits of\r\ntrade for the parish of Birmingham fur the year ending April 1, 1877,\r\nwere £3,989,000; and of the preceeding year £4,292,000--a falling off of\r\n£323,000, or a trifle over 8 per cent. These figures of Mr.\r\nChamberlain's may be accepted as representing the present state, the\r\nincrease in numbers and consequent addition to the traffic \"in\" being\r\nbalanced by the lesser quantity of goods sent out, though it is\r\nquestionable whether the profits of trade now reach £3,000,000 per year.\r\nNotwithstanding the adverse times the failures have rather decreased\r\nthan otherwise, there being 13 bankruptcies and 313 arrangements by\r\ncomposition in 1883 against 14 and 324 respectively in 1882. To get at\r\nthe number of tradesmen, &c., is almost as difficult as to find out the\r\nvalue of their trade, but a comparison at dates fifty years apart will\r\nbe interesting as showing the increase that has taken place in that\r\nperiod. A Directory of 1824 gave a list of 141 different trades and the\r\nnames of 4,980 tradesmen; a similar work published in 1874 made 745\r\ntrades, with 33,462 tradesmen. To furnish a list of all the branches of\r\ntrade now carried on and the numbers engaged therein would fill many\r\npages, but a summary will be found under \"_Population_,\" and for fuller\r\nparticulars the reader must go to the Census Tables for 1881, which may\r\nbe seen at the Reference Library. The variety of articles made in this\r\ntown is simply incalculable, for the old saying that anything, from a\r\nneedle to a ship's anchor, could be obtained in Edgbaston Street is\r\nreally not far from the truth, our manufacturers including the makers of\r\nalmost everything that human beings require, be it artificial eyes and\r\nlimbs, ammunition, or armour; beads, buttons, bedsteads, or buckles;\r\ncocoa, candlesticks, corkscrews, or coffee-pots; door bolts, dessert\r\nforks, dog collars, or dish covers; edge tools, earrings, engines, or\r\neyeglasses; fire irons, fiddle-bows, frying pans, or fishhooks; gold\r\nchains, gas fittings, glass toys, or gun barrels; hairpins, harness,\r\nhandcuffs, or hurdles; ironwork, isinglass, inkstands, or inculators;\r\njewellery, javelins, jews' harps, or baby jumpers; kettles, kitchen\r\nranges, knife boards, or knuckle dusters; lifting-jacks, leg irons,\r\nlatches, or lanterns; magnets, mangles, medals, or matches; nails,\r\nneedles, nickel, or nutcrackers; organ pipes, optics, oilcans, or\r\nornaments; pins, pens, pickle forks, pistols, or boarding-pikes; quart\r\ncups, quoits, quadrats, or queerosities; rings, rasps, rifles, or\r\nrailway cars; spades, spectacles, saddlery, or sealing wax;\r\nthermometers, thimbles, toothpicks, or treacle taps; umbrellas or\r\nupholstery; ventilators, vices, varnish, or vinegar; watches,\r\nwheelbarrows, weighing machines or water closets. A Londoner who took\r\nstock of our manufactories a little while back, received information\r\nthat led him to say, a week's work in Birmingham comprises, among its\r\nvarious results, the fabrication of 14,000,000 pens, 6,000 bedsteads,\r\n7,000 guns, 300,000,000 cut nails, 100,000,000 buttons, 1,000 saddles,\r\n5,000,000 copper or bronze coins, 20,000 pairs of spectacles, 6 tons of\r\npapier-mache wares, over £20,000 worth of gold and silver jewellery,\r\nnearly an equal value of gilt and cheap ornaments, £12,000 worth of\r\nelectro-plated wares, 4,000 miles of iron and steel wire, 10 tons of\r\npins, 5 tons of hairpins and hooks and eyes, 130,000 gross of wood\r\nscrews, 500 tons of nuts and screw-bolts and spikes, 50 tons of wrought\r\niron hinges, 350 miles' length of wax for vestas, 40 tons of refined\r\nmetal, 40 tons of German silver, 1,000 dozen of fenders, 3,500 bellows,\r\n800 tons of brass and copper wares. Several of these items are rather\r\nover the mark, but the aggregate only shows about one half a real week's\r\nwork, as turned out when trade is good.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Implements_, such as draining tools, digging and manure\r\nforks, hay knives, scythes, shovels, spades, &c., as well as mowing\r\nmachines, garden and farm rollers, ploughs, harrows, &c., are the\r\nspecialities of some half-dozen firms, the oldest-established being\r\nMessrs. Mapplebeck and Lowe, opposite Smithfield Market.\r\n\r\n_American Traders_.--It has been stated that there is not a _bona fide_\r\nAmerican trader residing amongst us, though at one time they were almost\r\nas numerous as the Germans now are. Be that as it may, the following\r\nstatistics, giving the declared value of exports from Birmingham to\r\nAmerica during the ten years ending Sept. 30, 1882, (taken from a report\r\nmade by the American Consul-General in London), show that a vast trade\r\nis still being carried on with our friends on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic:--Year ending September 30 1873, 7,463,185 dols.; 1874,\r\n5,778,957 dols.; 1875, 4,791,231 dols.; 1876, 3,135,234 dols.; 1877,\r\n2,842,871 dols.; 1878 2,309,513 dols.; 1879, 2,435,271 dols.; 1880,\r\n4,920,433 dols.; 1881, 4,376,611 dols.; 1882, 5,178,118 dols. Total,\r\n43,231,429 dols.\r\n\r\n_Ammunition_.--To manufacture ammunition for guns and pistols so long\r\nmade here by the scores of thousands would seem but the natural\r\nsequence, but though percussion caps were yearly sent from here in\r\nmillions of grosses, the manufacture of the complete cartridge is a\r\nbusiness of later growth. For the invention of gunpowder the world had\r\nto thank a monk, and it is no less curious that we owe percussion caps\r\nto the scientific genius of another Churchman, the first patent for\r\ntheir construction being taken out by the Rev. Mr. Forsyth in 1807. They\r\nwere very little thought of for long after Waterloo, and not introduced\r\ninto \"the service\" until 1839, several foreign armies being supplied\r\nwith them before the War Office allowed them to be used by \"Tommy\r\nAtkins\" with his \"Brown Bess.\" A machine for making percussion caps was\r\npatented by John Abraham in 1864. The manufacture of such articles at\r\nall times involves several dangerous processes, and Birmingham has had\r\nto mourn the loss of many of her children through accidents arising\r\ntherefrom. (See \"_Explosions_.\") The ammunition works of Messrs. Kynoch\r\nand Co., at Witton, cover over twenty acres, and gives employment to\r\nseveral hundred persons, the contrariness of human nature being\r\nexemplified in the fact that the death-dealing articles are mainly\r\nmanufactured by females, the future mothers or wives perchance of men to\r\nbe laid low by the use of such things. The plant is capable of turning\r\nout 500,000 cartridges per day, as was done during the Turkish war, and\r\nit takes 50 tons of rolled brass, 100 tons of lead, and 20 tons of\r\ngunpowder weekly to keep the factory fully going, all kinds of\r\nammunition for rifles and machine guns being made on the premises. Other\r\nextensive works are those of the Birmingham Small Arms and Metal Co., at\r\nAdderley Park Mills, and the National Arms and Ammunition Co., at Small\r\nHeath, and Perry Barr.\r\n\r\n_Artificial Eyes and Limbs_ are necessary articles to some members of\r\nthe genus _homo_, but the demand, fortunately, is not of such an\r\nextensive character as to require many manufacturers; indeed, the only\r\nfirm in Birmingham that devotes itself entirely to supplying artificial\r\nlimbs is that of Messrs. Best and Son, Summer Lane, whose specialities\r\nin the way of arms and legs are famed in all English and Continental\r\nmedical circles as wonderful examples of the peculiar mechanism\r\nrequisite to successfully imitate the motions and powers of natural\r\nlimbs. There are half-a-dozen makers of \"eyes,\" human and otherwise, the\r\nchief being Messrs. Pache and Son, Bristol Street, and Mr. Edward\r\nHooper, Suffolk Street, who hold the almost unique position of being the\r\nsole known makers of artificial human eyes anywhere. Few people would\r\nimagine it, but it is said that there are at least 1,500 persons in\r\nBirmingham who carry glass eyes in their head; while the demand from\r\nforeign countries is something enormous, the United States taking the\r\nlead as they fain would do in everything. But there is no part of the\r\ncivilised world, from Spitzbergen to Timbuctoo, where Birmingham made\r\neyes are not to be seen, even the callous \"heathen Chinee\" buying them\r\nin large quantities. Naturalists and taxidermists find here eyes to\r\nmatch those of any creature that has lived and breathed, and \"doll's\r\neyes\" are made by the ton.\r\n\r\n_Bedsteads, Metallic_.--The making of iron and brass bedsteads, as a\r\nstaple trade, dates only from the accession of Her Majesty; but, unlike\r\nthat august personage, they were a long time before they were\r\nappreciated as they deserved to be, for, in 1850, there were only four\r\nor five manufacturers in the town, and their output did not reach 500 a\r\nweek. Now, about 1,800 hands are employed in the trade, and the annual\r\nvalue of the work sent out cannot be less than £200,000.\r\n\r\n_Boilermaking_.--The making of iron boilers, gasholders, sugar-boilers,\r\n&c., may be dated as a special trade from about 1831, when 30 men and\r\nboys were employed thereat, turning out about 150 tons yearly; in 1860,\r\nabout 200 hands turned out 1,000 tons; in 1880 the workers were roughly\r\nestimated at 750 to 800 and the output at 4,500 tons.\r\n\r\n_Booksellers_.--In 1750, there were but three, Aris, Warren, and\r\nWollaston: now the booksellers, publishers, and wholesale stationers are\r\nover a hundred, while small shops may be counted to treble the number.\r\n\r\n_Boots and Shoes_ are manufactured by about 40 wholesale houses, several\r\ndoing a great trade, and of retailers and little men there are a dozen\r\ngross, not counting cobblers who come with the last. American-made\r\narticles were first on sale here in March 1877. Rivetted boots may be\r\nsaid to have originated (in 1840) through the mistake of a local\r\nfactor's traveller, who booked an order for copper sprigs too extensive\r\nfor his customer. Another of the firm's commercials suggested the\r\nrivetting if iron lasts were used. A Leicester man, in a small way, took\r\nup the notion, and made a fortune at it, the real inventor only getting\r\ngood orders. Ellis's patent boot studs to save the sole, and the\r\nEuknemida, or concave-convex fastening springs, are the latest\r\nnovelties.\r\n\r\n_Brass_.--The making of goods in brass was commenced here about 1668,\r\nbut the manufacturer of brass itself was not carried on before 1740,\r\nwhen Mr. Turner built his works in Coleshill Street. The Brass and\r\nSpelter Co. was started in February 1781, with a capital of £20,000 in\r\n£100 shares. Brasshouse Passage, Broad Street, tells of the site of\r\nanother smelting place, the last chimney of which was demolished on\r\nJanuary 27. 1866. The Waterworks Co. bought the site for offices.\r\nStamped brass came in through Richard Ford in 1769, and the process at\r\nfirst was confined to the manufacture of small basins and pans, but in a\r\nvery few years it was adapted to the production of an infinitude of\r\narticles. Pressed brass rack pulleys for window blinds were the\r\ninvention of Thomas Horne, in 1823, who applied the process of pressure\r\nto many other articles. Picture frames, nicely moulded in brass, were\r\nmade here in 1825, by a modeller named Maurice Garvey. In 1865 it was\r\nestimated that the quantities of metal used here in the manufacture of\r\nbrass were 19,000 tons of copper, 8,000 tons of old metal, 11,000 tons\r\nof zinc or spelter, 200 tons of tin, and 100 tons of lead, the total\r\nvalue being £2,371,658. Nearly double this quantity is now used every\r\nyear. The number of hands employed in the brass trade is about 18,000.\r\n\r\n_Buckles_ were first worn as shoe fastenings in the reign of Charles II.\r\nWhen in fashion they were made of all sizes and all prices, from the\r\ntiny half-inch on the hatband to the huge shoebuckle for the foot, and\r\nvarying from a few pence in price to many guineas the pair. The extent\r\nof the manufactures at one time may be guessed from the fact of there\r\nbeing over 20,000 buckle makers out of employ in 1791-2, when vain\r\npetitions were made to the royal princes to stem the change then taking\r\nplace in the \"fashions.\" Sir Edward Thomason said his father in 1780\r\nmade 1,000 pair par day, mostly of white metal, but some few plated; by\r\none pattern, known as the \"silver penny,\" he cleared a profit of £1,000.\r\nThe introduction of shoestrings, and naturally so, was much ridiculed in\r\nour local papers, and on one occasion was made the pretext for a\r\ndisgraceful riot, the pickpockets mobbing the gentlemen going to and\r\nfrom one of the Musical Festivals, the wearers of shoestrings being\r\nhustled about and robbed of their purses and watches.\r\n\r\n_Buttons_.--The earliest record of button-making we have is dated 1689,\r\nbut Mr. Baddeley (inventor of the oval chuck), who retired from business\r\nabout 1739, is the earliest local manufacturer we read of as doing\r\nlargely in the trade, though sixty or seventy years ago there were four\r\nor five times as many in the business as at present, blue coats and gilt\r\nbuttons being in fashion. By an Act passed in the 4th of William and\r\nMary foreign buttons made of hair were forbidden to be imported. By\r\nanother Act, in the 8th of Queen Anne it was decreed that \"any taylor or\r\nother person convicted of making, covering, selling, using, or setting\r\non to a garment any buttons covered with cloth, or other stuff of which\r\ngarments are made, shall forfeit five pounds for every dozen of such\r\nbuttons, or in proportion for any lesser quantity;\" by an Act of the\r\nseventh of George the First, \"any wearer of such unlawful buttons is\r\nliable to the penalty of forty shillings per dozen, and in proportion\r\nfor any lesser quantity.\" Several cases are on record in which tradesmen\r\nhave been heavily fined under these; strange laws, and before they were\r\nrepealed it is related by Dr. Doran (in 1855) that one individual not\r\nonly got out of paying for a suit of clothes because of the illegality\r\nof the tailor in using covered buttons, but actually sued the\r\nunfortunate \"snip\" for the informer's share of the penalties, the\r\nfunniest part of the tale being that the judge who decided the case, the\r\nbarrister who pleaded the statute, and the client who gained the clothes\r\nhe ought to have paid for, were all of them buttoned contrary to law.\r\nThese Acts were originally enforced to protect the many thousands who at\r\nthe time were employed in making buttons of silk, thread, &c., by hand,\r\nand _not_, as is generally supposed, in favour of the metal button\r\nmanufacturers, though on April 4, 1791, Thomas Gem, the solicitor to the\r\ncommittee for the protection of the button trade, advertised a reward\r\nfor any information against the wearers of the unlawful covered buttons.\r\nThe \"gilt button days\" of Birmingham was a time of rare prosperity, and\r\ndire was the distress when, like the old buckles, the fashion of wearing\r\nthe gilt on the blue went out. Deputations to royalty had no effect in\r\nstaying the change, and thousands were thrown on the parish. It was\r\nsought to revive the old style in 1850, when a deputation of button\r\nmakers solicited Prince Albert to patronise the metallic buttons for\r\ngentlemen's coats, but Fashion's fiat was not to be gainsayed. John\r\nTaylor, High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1756, is said to have sent out\r\nabout £800 worth of buttons per week. Papier maché buttons came in with\r\nHenry Clay's patent in 1778. He also made buttons of slate. Boulton, of\r\nSoho, was the first to bring out steel buttons with facets, and it is\r\nsaid that for some of superior design he received as much as 140 guineas\r\nper gross. Horn buttons, though more correctly speaking they should have\r\nbeen called \"hoof\" buttons, were a great trade at one time, selling in\r\n1801 as low as 5-1/2d. per gross. \"Maltese buttons\" (glass beads mounted\r\nin metal) were, in 1812, made here in large quantities, as were also the\r\n\"Bath metal drilled shank button\" of which 20,000 gross per week were\r\nsent out, and a fancy cut white metal button, in making which 40 to 50\r\nfirms were engaged, each employing 20 to 40 hands, but the whole trade\r\nin these specialities was lost in consequence of a few men being enticed\r\nto or imprisoned in France, and there establishing a rival manufacture.\r\nFlexible shanks were patented in 1825 by B. Sanders. Fancy silk buttons,\r\nwith worked figured tops, were patented by Wm. Elliott, in 1837.\r\nPorcelain buttons, though not made here, were designed and patented by a\r\nBirmingham man, R. Prosser, in 1841. The three-fold linen button was the\r\ninvention of Humphrey Jeffries, in 1841, and patented by John Aston. In\r\n1864 so great was the demand for these articles that one firm is said to\r\nhave used up 63,000 yards of cloth and 34 tons of metal in making them.\r\nCadbury and Green's \"very\" button is an improvement on these. Vegetable\r\nivory, the product of a tree growing in Central America and known as the\r\nCorozo palm, was brought into the button trade about 1857. The shells\r\nused in the manufacture of pearl buttons are brought from many parts of\r\nthe world, the principal places being the East Indies, the Red Sea, the\r\nPersian Gulf, the islands of the Pacific Ocean, Panama, and the coasts\r\nof Central America, Australia, New Zealand, &c. The prices of \"shell\"\r\nvary very much, some not being worth more than £20 per ton, while as\r\nhigh as £160 to £170 has been paid for some few choice samples brought\r\nfrom Macassar, a seaport in India. The average import of shell is about\r\n1,000 tons per year, and the value about £30,000.--There are 265 button\r\nmanufacturers in Birmingham, of whom 152 make pearl buttons, 26 glass, 8\r\nhorn and bone, 14 ivory, 12 gilt metal, 3 wood, and 5 linen, the other\r\n45 being of a mixed or general character, silver, brass, steel, wood,\r\nand papier maché, being all, more or less, used. Nearly 6,000 hands are\r\nemployed in the trade, of whom about 1,700 are in the pearl line, though\r\nthat branch is not so prosperous as it was a few years back.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Manufactures_.--About 50,000 tons of soda, soup, bleaching\r\npowder, oil of vitriol, muriatic acid, sulphuric acid, &c., are\r\nmanufactured in or near Birmingham, every year, more than 20,000 tons of\r\nsalt, 20,000 tons of pyrites, and 60,000 tons of coal being used in the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n_China_, in the shape of knobs, &c., was introduced into the brass\r\nfounding trade by Harcourt Bros, in 1844. China bowls or wheels for\r\ncastors were first used in 1849 by J.B. Geithner.\r\n\r\n_Chlorine_.--James Watt was one of the first to introduce the use of\r\nchlorine as a bleaching agent.\r\n\r\n_Citric Acid_.--Messrs. Sturge have over sixty years been manufacturing\r\nthis pleasant and useful commodity at their works in Wheeley's Lane. The\r\nacid is extracted from the juice of the citron, the lime, and the lemon,\r\nfruits grown in Sicily and the West Indies. The Mountserrat Lime-Juice\r\nCordial, lately brought into the market, is also made from these fruits.\r\nAbout 350 tons of the acid, which is used in some dying processes, &c.,\r\nis sent out annually.\r\n\r\n_Coins, Tokens, and Medals_.--Let other towns and cities claim\r\npreeminence for what they may, few will deny Birmingham's right to stand\r\nhigh in the list of money-making places. At what date it acquired its\r\nevil renown for the manufacture of base coin it would be hard to tell,\r\nbut it must have been long prior to the Revolution of 1688, as in some\r\nverses printed in 1682, respecting the Shaftesbury medal, it is thus\r\nsneeringly alluded to:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The wretch that stamped got immortal fame,\r\n  'Twas coined by stealth, like groats in Birminghame.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSmiles, in his lives of Boulton and Watt, referring to the middle of the\r\nlast century, says, \"One of the grimmest sights of those days were the\r\nskeletons of convicted coiners dangling from gibbets on Handsworth\r\nHeath.\" Coining was a capital offence for hundreds of years, but more\r\npoor wretches paid the penalty of their crimes in London in a single\r\nyear than here in a century, wicked as the bad boys of Brummagem were.\r\nAn immense trade was certainly done in the way of manufacturing\r\n\"tokens,\" but comparatively few counterfeits of the legal currency were\r\nissued, except in cases where \"a royal patent\" had been granted for the\r\npurpose, as in the instance of the historical \"Wood's half-pence,\"\r\n£100,000 worth (nominal) of which, it is said, were issued for\r\ncirculation in Ireland. These were called in, as being too bad, even for\r\nPaddy's land, and probably it was some of these that the hawker,\r\narrested here Oct. 31, 1733, offered to take in payment for his goods.\r\nHe was released on consenting to the £7 worth he had received being cut\r\nby a brazier and sold as metal, and his advertisements (hand bills)\r\nburnt. These bad half pence weighed about 60 to the lb., 2s. 6d. worth\r\n(nominal) being somewhat less than 10d. in value. In the ten years prior\r\nto 1797 it has been estimated that 700 tons of copper were manufactured\r\nhere into tokens, and the issue of the celebrated Soho pence, providing\r\nthe nation with a sufficiency of legitimate copper coin, did not stay\r\nthe work, the number of tokens in circulation in the early part of the\r\npresent century being something wonderful, as many as 4,000 different\r\nvarieties having been described by collectors, including all\r\ndenominations, from the Bank of England's silver dollar to a country\r\nhuckster's brass farthing. More than nine-tenths of these were made in\r\nBirmingham, and, of course, our tradesmen were not backward with their\r\nown specimens. The Overseers issued the well-known \"Workhouse Penny,\" a\r\ncopper threepenny piece, silver shillings and sixpences, paper notes for\r\n2s. 6d., and leather bonds for 5s. With the exception of the penny these\r\nare all scarce now, particularly the 5s., 2s. 6d., and 6d., a specimen\r\nof the latter lately being sold at auction for 47s. In 1812 Sir Edward\r\nThomason struck, for a Reading banker (Mr. J.B. Monk), 800 gold tokens\r\nof the nominal value of 40s. each; but this was just a step too far, and\r\nthe Government forbade their use. In the same year he also manufactured\r\ntwo million penny tokens for our soldiers in Spain, which were _not_\r\nforbidden. The permitted manufacture of token money came to an end with\r\nthe year 1817, an Act coming into force Jan. 1, 1818, forbidding further\r\nissue from that date, or the circulation of them after the end of the\r\nyear, except in the case of the Overseers of Birmingham, who were\r\ngranted grace till Lady-day, 1820, to call in what they had issued. In\r\n1786 Boulton struck over 100 tons of copper for the East India Co., and,\r\nadding to his presses yearly, soon had plenty of orders, including\r\ncopper for the American Colonies, silver for Sierra Leone, and a\r\nbeautiful set for the French Republic. To enumerate all the various\r\ncoins, medals, and tokens issued from Soho would take too much space,\r\nbut we may say that he brought the art of coining to a perfection very\r\nlittle surpassed even in the present day. In 1789 he made for the Privy\r\nCouncil a model penny, halfpenny, and farthing, but red-tapeism delayed\r\nthe order until 1797, when he began coining for the Government\r\ntwopennies (only for one year), pennies, halfpennies and farthings,\r\ncontinuing to do so until 1806, by which time he had sent out not less\r\nthan 4,200 tons weight. In this coinage of 1797 the penny was made of\r\nthe exact weight of 1 oz., the other coins being in proportion. In 1799,\r\neighteen pennies were struck out of the pound of metal, but the people\r\nthought they were counterfeit, and would not take them until a\r\nproclamation ordering their circulation, was issued December 9th. They\r\nbecame used to a deprecation of currency after that, and there was but\r\nvery little grumbling in 1805, when Boulton was ordered to divide the\r\npound of copper into 24 pennies. The machinery of Boulton's mint, with\r\nthe collection of dies, pattern coins, tokens, and medals, were sold by\r\nauction in 1850. The collection should have numbered 119 different\r\npieces, but there was not a complete set for sale. The mint, however,\r\ncould not be called extinct, as Messrs. Watt and Co. (successors to\r\nBolton and Watt), who had removed to Smethwick in 1848, struck over\r\n3,300 tons of copper and bronze coin between 1860 and 1866, mostly for\r\nForeign countries. The first English copper penny (1797) was struck in\r\nBirmingham, and so was the last. Messrs. Ralph Heaton and Son (the mint,\r\nWarstone Line) receiving the contract in April, 1853. for 500 tons of\r\ncopper coin, comprising pence, half-pence, farthings, half-farthings,\r\nand quarter-farthings. The present bronze coinage came into use December\r\n1st, 1860, and Messrs. Heaton have had several contracts therefor since\r\nthen. This firm has acquired a reputation quite equal to the Soho Mint,\r\nand hive supplied the coins--silver, copper, and bronze--for Belgium,\r\nCanada, China, Chili, Denmark, Germany, Hayti, India, Republic of\r\nColumbia, Sarawak, Sweden, Tunis, Turkey, Tuscany, Venezuela, and other\r\nPrincipalities and States, including hundreds of tons of silver blanks\r\nfor our own Government and others, sending workmen and machinery to the\r\ncountries where it was preferred to have the coins struck at home.\r\nBoulton, in his day, supplied the presses and machinery for the Mint on\r\nTower Hill (and they are still in use), as well as for the Danish,\r\nSpanish, and Russian authorities. Mexico, Calcutta, Bombay, &c. Messrs.\r\nHeaton, and the modern Soho firm, also dealing in such articles.\r\nForemost among modern local medallists, is Mr. Joseph Moore, of Pitsford\r\nStreet, whose cabinet of specimens is most extensive. An effort is being\r\nmade to gather for the new Museum and Art Gallery a collection of all\r\ncoins, medals, and tokens struck in Birmingham, and if it can be\r\nperfected it will necessarily be a very valuable one.\r\n\r\n_Coal_.--Over half-a-million tons of coal are used in Birmingham\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n_Cocoa_.--The manufacture of cocoa cannot be classed among the staple\r\ntrades of the town, but one of the largest establishments of the kind in\r\nthe kingdom, if not in the world, is that of Messrs. Cadbury, at\r\nBournville, where nearly 400 persons are employed. The annual\r\nconsumption of cocoa in this country is estimated at 13,000,000 lbs.,\r\nand the proportion manufactured by Messrs. Cadbury, who have houses in\r\nParis, Sydney, Melbourne, Montreal, &e., may be guessed at from the fact\r\nthat their works cover nearly four acres, and packing-boxes are required\r\nat the rate of 12,000 per week.\r\n\r\n_Copying Presses_ were invented by James Watt in, and patented in, May,\r\n1780. His partner, Boulton, had a lot ready for the market, and sold 150\r\nby the end of the year.\r\n\r\n_Compressed Air Power_.--A hundred years ago every little brook and\r\nstreamlet was utilised for producing the power required by our local\r\nmill-owners, gun-barrel rollers, &c. Then came the world's\r\nrevolutioniser, steam, and no place in the universe has profited more by\r\nits introduction than this town. Gas engines are now popular, and even\r\nwater engines are not unknown, while the motive power derivable from\r\nelectricity is the next and greatest boon promised to us. Meanwhile, the\r\nintroduction of compressed air as a means of transmitting power for long\r\ndistances marks a new and important era, not only in engineering\r\nscience, but in furthering the extension of hundreds of those small\r\nindustries, which have made Birmingham so famous a workshop. In the\r\nBirmingham Compressed Air Power Company's Bill (passed March 12, 1884),\r\nthe principle involved is the economic utility of centralising the\r\nproduction of power, and many engineers are of opinion that no other\r\nmeans can possibly be found so convenient as the use of compressed air\r\nin transmitting motive power, or at so low a cost, the saving being\r\nquite 20 per cent, compared with the use of steam for small engines. The\r\nBirmingham Bill provides for the supply of compressed air within the\r\nwards of St. Bartholomew, St. Martin, Deritend, and Bordesley, which\r\nhave been selected by the promoters as affording the most promising\r\narea. In the three wards named there were rated in March of 1883, as\r\nmany as 164 engines, of which the nominal horse-power varied from 1/2 to\r\n10, fifty-nine from 11 to 20 fifteen from 21 to 30, six from 32 to 50,\r\nten from 52 to 100, and four from 102 to 289. Assuming that of these the\r\nengines up to 30-horse power would alone be likely to use compressed\r\nair, the promoters count upon a demand in the three wards for 1,946\r\nnominal, and perhaps 3,000 indicated horse-power. To this must be added\r\nan allowance for the probability that the existence of so cheap and\r\nconvenient a power \"laid on\" in the streets will attract other\r\nmanufacturers to the area within which it is to be available. It is\r\nproposed, therefore, to provide machinery and plant capable of\r\ndelivering 5,000 indicated horse-power in compressed air, and to acquire\r\nfor the works sufficient land to permit of their dimensions being\r\ndoubled when extension shall become necessary. The site which has been\r\nchosen is a piece of ground belonging to the Birmingham and Warwick\r\nCanal Company, and situated by the canal, and bounded on both sides by\r\nSampson Road North and Henley Street. Here the promoters are putting\r\ndown four air-compressing engines, driven by compound and condensing\r\nsteam engines and which are to be heated by six sets (four in each set)\r\nof elephant boilers. From the delivery branches of the air-compressors a\r\nmain 30in. in diameter will be laid along Henley Street, and,\r\nbifurcating, will be taken through Sampson Road North and Stratford\r\nStreet at a diameter of 24in. The mains will then divide, to as to pass\r\ndown Sandy Lane, Fazeley Street, Floodgate Street, Bradford Street,\r\nBromsgrove Street, and other thoroughfares, giving off smaller branches\r\nat frequent intervals, and so forming an elaborate network. The whole\r\ncost of buildings, plant, and construction is estimated at £140,500, but\r\nupon this large outlay it is hoped to realise a net annual profit of\r\n£9,164, or 6-1/2 per cent, on capital. The engineers, reckoning the\r\nannual cost of producing small steam power in Birmingham at £10 per\r\nindicated horse-power, which will probably be regarded as well within\r\nthe mark, propose to furnish compressed air at £8 per annum, and if they\r\nsucceed in carrying out the scheme as planned, it will without doubt be\r\none of the greatest blessings ever conferred on the smaller class of our\r\ntown's manufacturers.\r\n\r\n_Fenders and Fireirons_.--The making of these finds work for 800 or 900\r\nhands, and stove grates (a trade introduced from Sheffield about 20\r\nyears back) almost as many.\r\n\r\n_Files and Rasps_ are manufactured by 60 firms, whose total product,\r\nthough perhaps not equal to the Sheffield output, is far from\r\ninconsiderable. Machines for cutting files and rasps were patented by\r\nMr. Shilton, Dartmouth Street, in 1833.\r\n\r\n_Fox, Henderson and Co_.--In March, 1853, this arm employed more than\r\n3,000 hands, the average weekly consumption of iron being over 1,000\r\ntons. Among the orders then in hand were the ironwork for our Central\r\nRailway Station, and for the terminus at Paddington, in addition to\r\ngasometers, &c., for Lima, rails, wagons and wheels for a 55-mile line\r\nin Denmark, and the removal and re-election[1] of the Crystal Palace at\r\nSydenham.-See \"_Exhibitions,\" \"Noteworthy men_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Transcriber's note: this is probably a typographical error\r\nfor \"re-erection\".]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galvanised Buckets_ and other articles are freely made, but the\r\ngalvanisers can hardly be pleasant neighbours, as at the works of one\r\nfirm 40 to 50 carboys of muriatic acid and several of sulphuric acid are\r\nused every day, while at another place the weekly consumption of\r\nchemicals runs to two tons of oil of vitriol and seven tons of muriatic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n_German Silver_.--To imitate closely as possible the precious metals, by\r\na mixture of baser ones, is not exactly a Birmingham invention, as\r\nproved by the occasional discovery of counterfeit coin of very ancient\r\ndate, but to get the best possible alloy sufficiently malleable for\r\ngeneral use has always been a local desideratum. Alloys of copper with\r\ntin, spelter or zinc were used here in 1795, and the term \"German\" was\r\napplied to the best of these mixtures as a Jacobinical sneer at the\r\npretentious appellation of silver given it by its maker. After the\r\nintroduction of nickel from the mines in Saxony, the words \"German\r\nsilver\" became truthfully appropriate as applied to that metal, but so\r\nhabituated have the trade and the public become to brassy mixtures that\r\nGerman silver must always be understood as of that class only.\r\n\r\n_Glass_--The art of painting, &c. on glass was brought to great\r\nperfection by Francis Eginton, of the Soho Works, in 1784. He supplied\r\nwindows for St. George's Chapel, Windsor, Salisbury and Lichfield\r\nCathedrals, and many country churches. The east window of St. Paul's,\r\nBirmingham, and the east window of the south aisle in Aston Church, are\r\nby Eginton. One of the commissions he obtained was from the celebrated\r\nWilliam Beckford, Lord Mayor of London, for windows at Fonthill, to the\r\nvalue of £12,000. He was not, however, the first local artist of the\r\nkind, for a Birmingham man is said to have painted a window in Haglev\r\nChurch, in 1756-57, for Lord Lyttelton, though his name is not now\r\nknown. William Raphael Eginton (son of Francis) appeared in the\r\nDirectory of 1818, as a glass-painter to the Princess Charlotte, but we\r\ncan find no trace of his work. Robert Henderson started in the same line\r\nabout 1820, and specimens of his work may be seen in Trinity Chapel; he\r\ndied in 1848. John Hardman began in Paradise Street about 1837,\r\nafterwards removing to Great Charles Street, and thence to Newhall Hill,\r\nfrom which place much valuable work has been issued, as the world-known\r\nname well testifies. Engraving on glass is almost as old as the\r\nintroduction of glass itself. There is a beautiful specimen in the Art\r\nGallery. Glass flowers, fruit, &c., as ornamental adjuncts to\r\nbrassfoundry, must be accredited to W. C. Aitken, who first used them in\r\n1846. American writers claim that the first pressed glass tumbler was\r\nmade about 40 years back in that country, by a carpenter. We have good\r\nauthority for stating that the first pressed tumbler was made in this\r\ncountry by Rice Harris, Birmingham, as far back as 1834. But some years\r\nearlier than this dishes had been pressed by Thomas Hawkes and Co., of\r\nDudley, and by Bacchus and Green, of Birmingham. No doubt the earliest\r\npressing was the old square feet to goblets, ales, jellies, &c.\r\nPrimitive it was, but like Watt's first engine, it was the starting\r\npoint, and Birmingham is entitled to the credit of it. It is very\r\nremarkable that none of the samples of Venetian glass show any pressing,\r\nalthough moulding was brought by them to great perfection. It would not\r\nbe fair to omit the name of the first mould-maker who made the\r\ntumbler-mould in question. It was Mr. James Stevens, then of Camden\r\nStreet, Birmingham, and it is to him, and his sons, James and William,\r\nthat the world is greatly indebted for the pressing of glass. The older\r\nStevens has been dead some years, and the sons have left the trade.\r\nPrevious to this mould being made for tumblers, Mr. James Stevens made\r\nsome pressed salt-moulds to order for an American gentleman visiting\r\nBirmingham. Some of the most beautiful works in glass fountains,\r\ncandelabra, &c., that the world has ever seen have been made at Messrs.\r\nOslers, Broad Street, whose show rooms are always open to visitors.\r\n\r\n_Guns_.--The imitative, if not inventive, powers of our forefathers have\r\nbeen shown in so many instances, that it is not surprising we have no\r\nabsolute record of the first gun-maker, when he lived, or where he\r\nworked, but we may be confident that firearms were not long in use\r\nbefore they were manufactured here. The men who made 15,000 swords for\r\nthe Commonwealth were not likely to go far for the \"musquets\" with which\r\nthey opposed Prince Rupert. The honour of procuring the first Government\r\ncontract for guns rests with Sir Richard Newdigate, one of the members\r\nfor the county in William III.'s reign, a trial order being given in\r\n1692, followed by a contract for 2,400 in 1693, at 17/-each. For the\r\nnext hundred years the trade progressed until the Government, in 1798,\r\nfound it necessary to erect \"view-rooms\" (now \"the Tower\", Bagot Street)\r\nin Birmingham. From 1804 to 1817 the number of muskets, rifles,\r\ncarbines, and pistols made here for the Government, amounted to\r\n1,827,889, in addition to 3,037,644 barrels and 2,879,203 locks sent to\r\nbe \"set up\" in London, and more than 1,000,000 supplied to the East\r\nIndia Co. In the ten years ending 1864 (including the Crimean War) over\r\n4,000,000 military barrels were proved in this town, and it has been\r\nestimated that during the American civil war our quarreling cousins were\r\nsupplied with 800,000 weapons from our workshops. Gunstocks are chiefly\r\nmade from beech and walnut, the latter for military and best work, the\r\nother being used principally for the African trade, wherein the prices\r\nhave ranged as low as 6s. 6d. per gun. Walnut wood is nearly all\r\nimported, Germany and Italy being the principal markets;--during the\r\nCrimean war one of our manufacturers set up sawmills at Turin, and it is\r\nstated that before he closed them he had used up nearly 10,000 trees,\r\naveraging not more than thirty gunstocks from each. To give anything\r\nlike a history of the expansion of, and changes in, the gun trade during\r\nthe last fifteen years, would require a volume devoted solely to the\r\nsubject, but it may not be uninteresting to enumerate the manifold\r\nbranches into which the trade has been divided--till late years most of\r\nthem being carried on under different roofs:--The first portion, or\r\n\"makers\", include--stock-makers, barrel welders, borers, grinders,\r\nfilers, and breechers; rib makers, breech forgers and stampers; lock\r\nforgers, machiners, and filers; furniture forgers, casters, and filers;\r\nrod forgers, grinders, polishers, and finishers; bayonet forgers, socket\r\nand ring stampers, grinders, polishers, machiners, hardeners, and\r\nfilers; band forgers, stampers, machiners, filers, and pin makers; sight\r\nstampers, machiners, jointers, and filers; trigger boxes, oddwork\r\nmakers, &c. The \"setters up\" include machines, jiggers (lump filers and\r\nbreak-off fitters), stockers, percussioners, screwers, strippers, barrel\r\nborers and riflers, sighters and sight-adjusters, smoothers, finishers\r\nmakers-off, polishers, engravers, browners, lock freers, &c., &c. The\r\nProof-house in Banbury Street, \"established for public safety\" as the\r\ninscription over the entrance says, was erected in 1813, and with the\r\nexception of one in London is the only building of the kind in England.\r\nIt is under the management of an independent corporation elected by and\r\nfrom members of the gun trade, more than half-a-million of barrels being\r\nproved within its walls yearly, the report for the year 1883 showing\r\n383,735 provisional proofs, and 297,704 definitive proofs. Of the\r\nbarrels subjected to provisional proof, 29,794 were best birding single,\r\n150,176 best birding double, and 160,441 African. Of those proved\r\ndefinitively, 63,197 were best double birding barrels, 110,369\r\nbreech-loading birding, 37,171 breech-loading choke bore, and 54,297\r\nsaddle-pistol barrels. As an instance of the changes going on in the\r\ntrades of the country, and as a contrast to the above figures,\r\nBirmingham formerly supplying nearly every firearm sold in England or\r\nexported from it, trade returns show that in 1882 Belgium imported\r\n252,850 guns and pistols, France 48,496, the United States 15,785,\r\nHolland 84,126, Italy 155,985, making (with 3,411 from other countries)\r\n560,653 firearms, valued at £124,813, rather a serious loss to the gun\r\ntrade of Birmingham.\r\n\r\n_Handcuffs and Leg Irons_.--It is likely enough true that prior to the\r\nabolition of slavery shackles and chains were made here for use in the\r\nhorrible traffic; but it was then a legal trade, and possibly the\r\narticles were classed as \"heavy steel toys,\" like the handcuffs and leg\r\nirons made by several firms now. A very heavy Australian order for these\r\nlast named was executed here in 1853, and there is always a small demand\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n_Hinges_.--Cast-iron hinges, secret joint, were patented in 1775 by\r\nMessrs. Izon and Whitehurst, who afterwards removed to West Bromwich.\r\nThe patent wrought iron hinge dates from 1840, since which year many\r\nimprovements have been made in the manufacture of iron, brass, wire,\r\ncast, wrought, pressed, and welded hinges, the makers numbering over\r\nthree score.\r\n\r\n_Hollow-ware_.--The invention of tinning iron pots and other hollow-ware\r\nwas patented in 1779 by Jonathan Taylor, the process being first carried\r\nout by Messrs. Izon and Whitehurst at their foundry in Duke Street. The\r\nenamelling of hollow-ware was Mr. Hickling's patent (1799), but his\r\nmethod was not very satisfactory, the present mode of enamelling dating\r\nfrom another patent taken out in 1839. Messrs. Griffiths and Browett,\r\nBradford Street, have the lion's share of the local trade, which is\r\ncarried on to a much greater extent at Wolverhampton than here.\r\n\r\n_Hydraulic Machinery_ is the specialite almost solely of Messrs. Tangye\r\nBros., who established their Cornwall Works in 1855.\r\n\r\n_Jewellery_.--A deputation from Birmingham waited upon Prince Albert,\r\nMay 28, 1845, at Buckingham Palace, for the purpose of appealing to Her\r\nMajesty, through His Royal Highness, to take into gracious consideration\r\nthe then depressed condition of the operative jewellers of Birmingham,\r\nand entreating the Queen and Prince to set the example of wearing\r\nBritish jewellery on such occasions and to such an extent as might meet\r\nthe royal approval. The deputation took with them as presents for the\r\nQueen, an armlet, a brooch, a pair of ear-rings, and a buckle for the\r\nwaist; for the Prince Consort a watch-chain, seal, and key, the value of\r\nthe whole being over 400 guineas. The armlet (described by good judges\r\nas the most splendid thing ever produced in the town) brooch, ear-rings,\r\nchain and key were made by Mr. Thomas Aston, Regent's Place; the buckle\r\nand seal (designed from the Warwick vase) by Mr. Baleny, St. Paul's\r\nSquare. It was stated by the deputation that 5,000 families were\r\ndependent on the jewellery trades in Birmingham. The \"custom of trade\"\r\nin connection with jewellers and the public was formerly of the most\r\narbitrary character, so much so indeed that at the Great Exhibition of\r\n1851, the Birmingham jewellers did not exhibit, except through the\r\nLondon houses they were in the habit of supplying, and the specimens\r\nshewn by these middlemen were of a very unsatisfactory character as\r\nregards design. It is almost impossible to describe them without\r\nappearing to exaggerate. Construction in relation to use went for\r\nnothing. A group of Louis Quatorze scrolls put together to form\r\nsomething like a brooch with a pin at the back to fasten it to the\r\ndress, which it rather disfigured than adorned; heavy chain-like\r\nbracelet, pins, studs, &c., of the most hideous conceits imaginable,\r\ncharacterised the jewellery designs of Birmingham until about 1854-55,\r\nwhen a little more intelligence and enterprise was introduced, and our\r\nmanufacturers learned that work well designed sold even better than the\r\nold-styled ugliness. A great advance has taken place during the past\r\nthirty years, and Birmingham jewellers now stand foremost in all matters\r\nof taste and design, the workmen of to-day ranking as artists indeed,\r\neven the commonest gilt jewellery turned out by them now being of\r\nhigh-class design and frequently of most elaborate workmanship. At the\r\npresent time (March 1885) the trade is in a very depressed condition,\r\nthousands of hands being out of employ or on short time, partly arising,\r\nno doubt, from one of those \"changes of fashion\" which at several\r\nperiods of our local history have brought disaster to many of our\r\nindustrial branches. It has been estimated that not more than one-half\r\nof the silver jewellery manufactured in Birmingham in 1883, passed\r\nthrough the Assay Office, but the total received there in the twelve\r\nmonths ending June 24th, 1883, amounted to no less than 856,180 ounces,\r\nor 31 tons 17 cwt. 4 lbs. 4 oz., the gold wares received during same\r\nperiod weighing 92,195 ounces, or 3 tons 7 cwt. 12 lbs. 3 oz., the total\r\nnumber of articles sent in for assaying being 2,649,379. The directory\r\nof 1780 gave the names of twenty-six jewellers; that of 1880 gives\r\nnearly 700, including cognate trades. The fashion of wearing long silver\r\nguard-chains came in in about 1806, the long gold ones dating a score\r\nyears later, heavy fob chains then going out. The yearly make of wedding\r\nrings in Birmingham is put at 5,000 dozen. Precious stones are not to be\r\nincluded in the list of locally manufactured articles, nor yet \"Paris\r\npastes,\" though very many thousands of pounds worth are used up every\r\nyear, and those anxious to become possessed of such glittering trifles\r\nwill find dealers here who can supply them with pearls from 6d., garnets\r\nfrom 2d., opals from 1s., diamonds, rubies, emeralds, amethysts, &c.,\r\nfrom half-a-crown, the prices of all running up according to size, &c.,\r\nto hundreds of pounds per stone.\r\n\r\n_Latten_, the term given to thin sheets of brass, was formerly applied\r\nto sheets of tinned iron.\r\n\r\n_Lockmakers_ are not so numerous here as they once were, though several\r\nwell known patentees still have their works in the borough. The general\r\ntrade centres round Willenhall, Walsall, and Wolverhampton.\r\n\r\n_Looking-glasses_.--Messrs. Hawkes's, Sromsgrove Street, is the largest\r\nlooking-glass manufactory in the world, more than 300 hands being\r\nemployed on the premises. A fire which took place Jan. 8, 1879,\r\ndestroyed nearly £12,000 worth of stock, the turnout of the\r\nestablishment comprising all classes of mirrors, from those at 2. a\r\ndozen to £40 or £50 each.\r\n\r\n_Mediæval Metalwork_.--Mr. John Hardman, who had Pugin for his friend,\r\nwas the first to introduce the manufacture of mediæval and\r\necclesiastical metal work in this town, opening his first factory in\r\nGreat Charles Street in 1845. The exhibits at the old Bingley Hall in\r\n1849 attracted great attention and each national Exhibition since has\r\nadded to the triumphs of the firm. Messrs. Jones and Willis also take\r\nhigh rank.\r\n\r\n_Metronome_, an instrument for marking time, was invented by Mr. W.\r\nHeaton, a local musician, about 1817.\r\n\r\n_Mineral Waters_.--The oldest local establishment for the manufacture of\r\naërated artificial and mineral waters is that of Messrs. James Goffe and\r\nSon, of Duke Street, the present proprietors of the artesian well in\r\nAllison Street. This well was formed some years ago by Mr. Clark, a\r\nLondon engineer, who had undertaken a Corporation contract connected\r\nwith the sewers. Finding himself embarassed with the flow of water from\r\nthe many springs about Park Street and Digbeth, he leased a small plot\r\nof land and formed a bore-hole, or artesian well, to check the\r\npercolation into his sewerage works. After boring about 400 feet he\r\nreached a main spring in the red sandstone formation which gives a\r\nconstant flow of the purest water, winter and summer, of over 70,000\r\ngals. per day, at the uniform temperature of 50 deg. The bore is only\r\n4in. diameter, and is doubly tubed the whole depth, the water rising\r\ninto a 12ft. brick well, from which a 4,000 gallon tank is daily filled,\r\nthe remainder passing through a fountain and down to the sewers as\r\nwaste. Dr. Bostock Hill, the eminent analyst, reports most favourably\r\nupon the freedom of the water from all organic or other impurities, and\r\nas eminently fitted for all kinds of aërated waters, soda, potass,\r\nseltzer, lithia, &c. The old-fashioned water-carriers who used to supply\r\nhouseholders with Digbeth water from \"the Old Cock pump\" by St. Martin's\r\nhave long since departed, but Messrs. Goff's smart-looking barrel-carts\r\nmay be seen daily on their rounds supplying the real _aqua pura_ to\r\ncounters and bars frequented by those who like their \"cold without,\" and\r\nlike it good.--Messrs. Barrett & Co. and Messrs. Kilby are also\r\nextensive manufacturers of these refreshing beverages.\r\n\r\n_Nails_.--No definite date can possibly be given as to the introduction\r\nof nailmaking here as a separate trade, most smiths, doubtless, doing\r\nmore or less at it when every nail had to be beaten out on the anvil.\r\nThat the town was dependent on outsiders for its main supplies 150 years\r\nback, is evidenced by the Worcestershire nailors marching from Cradley\r\nand the Lye, in 1737 to force the ironmongers to raise the prices.\r\nMachinery for cutting nails was tried as early as 1811, but it was a\r\nlong while after that (1856) before a machine was introduced\r\nsuccessfully. Now there are but a few special sorts made otherwise, as\r\nthe poor people of Cradley and the Lye Waste know to their cost,\r\nhand-made nails now being seldom seen.\r\n\r\n_Nettlefold's (Limited)_.--This, one of the most gigantic of our local\r\ncompanies, was registered in March, 1880, the capital being £750,000 in\r\nshares of £10 each, with power to issue debentures to the vendors of the\r\nworks purchased to the extent of £420,000. The various firms\r\nincorporated are those of Messrs. Nettlefold's, at Heath Street, and\r\nPrincip-street, Birmingham, at King's Norton, at Smethwick, &c., for the\r\nmanufacture of screws, wire, &c., the Castle Ironworks at Hadley,\r\nShropshire, and the Collieries at Ketley, in the same county; the\r\nBirmingham Screw Co., at Smethwick; the Manchester Steel Screw Co., at\r\nBradford, Manchester; Mr. John Cornforth, at Berkeley Street Wire and\r\nWire Nail Works; and Messrs. Lloyd and Harrison, at Stourport Screw\r\nWorks. The purchase money for the various works amounted to £1,024.000,\r\nMessrs. Nettlefold's share thereof being £786,000, the Birmingham Screw\r\nCo.'s £143,000, the Manchester Co.'s £50,000, Messrs. Cornforth, Lloyd\r\nand Harrison taking the remainder. The firm's works in Heath Street are\r\nthe most extensive of the kind in existence, the turnout being more than\r\n200,000 gross of screws per week, nearly 250 tons of wire being used up\r\nin the same period.--See \"_Screws_.\"\r\n\r\n_Nickel_ owes its introduction here to Mr. Askin, who, in 1832,\r\nsucceeded in refining the crude ore by precipitation, previously it\r\nhaving been very difficult to bring it into use. Electro-plating has\r\ncaused a great demand for it.\r\n\r\n_Nuts and Bolts_.--In addition to a score or two of private firms\r\nengaged in the modern industry of nut and bolt making, there are several\r\nlimited liability Co.'s, the chief being the Patent Nut and Bolt Co.\r\n(London Works, Smethwick), which started in 1863 with a capital of\r\n£400,000 in shares of £20 each. The last dividend (on £14 paid up) was\r\nat the rate of 10 per cent., the reserve fund standing at £120,000.\r\nMessrs. Watkins and Keen, and Weston and Grice incorporated with the\r\nPatent in 1865. Other Co.'s are the Midland Bolt and Nut Co. (Fawdry\r\nStreet, Smethwick), the Phoenix Bolt and Nut Co. (Handsworth), the\r\nPatent Rivet Co. (Rolfe Street, Smethwick), the Birmingham Bolt and Nut\r\nCo., &c.\r\n\r\n_Optical and Mathematical Instruments_ of all kinds were manufactured\r\nhere in large numbers eighty years ago, and many, such as the solar\r\nmicroscope, the kaleidoscope, &c. may be said to have had their origin\r\nin the workshops of Mr. Philip Carpenter and other makers in the first\r\ndecade of the present century. The manufacture of these articles as a\r\ntrade here is almost extinct.\r\n\r\n_Papier Maché_.--This manufacture was introduced here by Henry Clay in\r\n1772, and being politic enough to present Queen Caroline with a Sedan\r\nchair made of this material, he was patronised by the wealthy and titled\r\nof the day, the demand for his ware being so extensive that at one time\r\nhe employed over 300 hands, his profit being something like £3 out of\r\nevery £5. It has been stated that many articles of furniture, &c., made\r\nby him are still in use. Messrs. Jennens and Bettridge commenced in\r\n1816, and improvements in the manufacture have been many and continuous.\r\nGeorge Souter introduced pearl inlaying in 1825; electro-deposit was\r\napplied in 1844; \"gem inlaying\" in 1847, by Benj. Giles; aluminium and\r\nits bronze in 1864; the transfer process in 1856 by Tearne and Richmond.\r\nPaper pulp has been treated in a variety of ways for making button\r\nblanks, tray blanks, imitiation jet, &c., the very dust caused by\r\ncutting it up being again utilised by mixture with certain cements to\r\nform brooches, &c.\r\n\r\n_Paraffin_.--The manufacture of lamps for the burning of this material\r\ndates only from 1861.\r\n\r\n_Pins_.--What becomes of all the pins? Forty years ago it was stated\r\nthat 20,000,000 pins were made every day, either for home or export use,\r\nbut the total is now put at 50,000,000, notwithstanding which one can\r\nhardly be in the company of man, woman, or child, for a day without\r\nbeing asked \"Have you such a thing as a pin about you?\" Pins were first\r\nmanufactured here in quantities about 1750, the Ryland family having the\r\nhonour of introducing the trade. It formerly took fourteen different\r\npersons to manufacture a single pin, cutters, headers, pointers,\r\npolishers, &c., but now the whole process is performed by machinery. The\r\nproportion of pins made in Birmingham is put at 37,000,000 per day, the\r\nweight of brass wire annually required being 1,850,000 lbs., value\r\n£84,791; iron wire to the value of £5,016 is used for mourning and hair\r\npins. The census reports say there are but 729 persons employed (of whom\r\n495 are females) in the manufacture of the 11,500,000,000 pins sent from\r\nour factories every year.\r\n\r\n_Planes_.--Carpenters' planes were supplied to our factors in 1760 by\r\nWilliam Moss, and his descendants were in the business as late as 1844.\r\nMessrs. Atkins and Sons have long been celebrated makers, their hundreds\r\nof patterns including all kinds that could possibly he desired by the\r\nworkman. Woodwork is so cut, carved, and moulded by machinery now, that\r\nthese articles are not so much in demand, and the local firms who make\r\nthem number only a dozen.\r\n\r\n_Plated Wares_.--Soho was celebrated for its plated wares as early as\r\n1766; Mr. Thomason (afterwards Sir Edward) commenced the plating in\r\n1796; and Messrs. Waterhouse and Ryland, another well-known firm in the\r\nsame line, about 1808, the material used being silver rolled on copper,\r\nthe mountings silver, in good work, often solid silver. The directory of\r\n1780 enumerates 46 platers, that of 1799 96 ditto; their names might now\r\nbe counted on one's finger ends, the modern electro-plating having\r\nrevolutionised the business, vastly to the prosperity of the town.\r\n\r\n_Puzzles_.--The Yankee puzzle game of \"Fifteen,\" took so well when\r\nintroduced into this country (summer of 1880), that one of our local\r\nmanufacturers received an order to supply 10,000 gross, and he was\r\nclever enough to construct a machine that made 20 sets per minute.\r\n\r\n_Railway Waggon Works_.--With the exception of the carriage building\r\nworks belonging to the several great railway companies, Saltley may be\r\nsaid to be the headquarters of this modern branch of industry, in which\r\nthousands of hands are employed. The Midland Railway Carriage and Waggon\r\nCo. was formed in 1853, and has works of a smaller scale at Shrewsbury.\r\nThe Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Waggon Co. was originated in\r\nLondon, in 1845, but removed to Saltley in 1862, which year also saw the\r\nformation of the Union Rolling Stock Co. The capital invested in the\r\nseveral companies is very large, and the yearly value sent out is in\r\nproportion, more rolling stock being manufactured here than in all the\r\nother towns in the kingdom put together, not including the works of the\r\nrailway companies themselves. Many magnificent palaces on wheels have\r\nbeen made here for foreign potentates, Emperors, Kings, and Queens,\r\nSultans, and Kaisers, from every clime that the iron horse has travelled\r\nin, as well as all sorts of passenger cars, from the little narrow-gauge\r\nvehicles of the Festiniog line, on which the travellers must sit back to\r\nback, to the 60ft. long sleeping-cars used on the Pacific and Buenos\r\nAyers Railway, in each compartment of which eight individuals can find\r\nsleeping accommodation equal to that provided at many of the best\r\nhotels, or the curious-looking cars used on Indian railways, wherein the\r\nnatives squat in tiers, or, as the sailor would say, with an upper and\r\nlower deck.\r\n\r\n_Ropemaking_ is a trade carried on in many places, but there are few\r\nestablishments that can equal the Universe Works in Garrison Lane,\r\nwhere, in addition to hundreds of tons of twine and cord, there are\r\nmanufactured all sorts of wire and hemp ropes for colliery and other\r\npurposes, ocean telegraph cables included. Messrs. Wright introduced\r\nstrain machinery early in 1853, and in the following year they patented\r\na rope made of best hemp and galvanised wire spun together by machinery.\r\nOn a test one of these novelties, 4-1/4in. circumference, attached to\r\ntwo engines, drew a train of 300 tons weight. To supply the demand for\r\ngalvanised signalling and fencing cords, the machines must turn out\r\n15,000 yards of strand per day.\r\n\r\n_Rulemaking_, though formerly carried on in several places, is now\r\nalmost confined to this town and the metropolis, and as with jewellery\r\nso with rules, very much of what is called \"London work\" is, in reality,\r\nthe produce of Birmingham. Messrs. Rabone Brothers are the principal\r\nmakers, and the boxwood used is mostly obtained from Turkey and the\r\nLevant, but the firm does not confine itself solely to the manufacture\r\nof wood rules, their steel tapes, made up to 200ft in one length,\r\nwithout join of any sort, being a specialty highly appreciated by\r\nsurveyors and others.\r\n\r\n_Saddlery_.--One of the oldest local trades, as Lelaud, in 1538, speaks\r\nof \"lorimers\" as being numerous then. That there was an important\r\nleather market is certain (Hutton thought it had existed for 700 years),\r\nand we read of \"leather sealers\" among the local officers as well as of\r\na \"Leather Hall,\" at the east end of New Street. The trade has more than\r\nquadrupled during the last 25 years, about 3,000 hands being now engaged\r\ntherein, in addition to hundreds of machines.\r\n\r\n_Screws_.--In olden days the threads of a screw had to be filed out by\r\nhand, and the head struck up on the anvil. The next step was to turn\r\nthem in a lathe, but in 1849 a Gerimn clockmaker invented a machine by\r\nwhich females could make them five times as fast as the most skilful\r\nworkman, and, as usual, the supply created a demand; the trade for a few\r\nyears received many additions, and the \"screw girders,\" as the\r\nhard-working lasses were called, were to be met with in many parts of\r\nthe town. 1852, 1,500 hands were employed, the output being from 20 to\r\n25 tons per week, or 2,000,000 gross per year. Gradually, however, by\r\nthe introduction and patenting of many improvements in the machinery,\r\nthe girls were, in a great measure, dispensed with, and their employers\r\nas well, Messrs. Nettlefold and Chamberlain having, in 1865, nearly the\r\nwhole trade in their hands, and sending out 150,000 gross of screws per\r\nweek. Nearly 2,000 people are employed at Nettlefold's, including women\r\nand girls, who feed and attend the screw and nail-making machines.\r\nNotwithstanding the really complicated workings of the machines, the\r\nmaking of a screw seems to a casual visitor but a simple thing. From a\r\ncoil of wire a piece is cut of the right length by one machine, which\r\nroughly forms a head and passes it on to another, in which the blank has\r\nits head nicely shaped, shaved, and \"nicked\" by a revolving saw. It than\r\npasses by an automatic feeder into the next machine where it is pointed\r\nand \"wormed,\" and sent to be shook clear of the \"swaff\" of shaving cut\r\nout for the worm. Washing and polishing in revolving barrels precedes\r\nthe examination of every single screw, a machine placing them one by one\r\nso that none can be missed sight of. Most of the 2,000 machines in use\r\nare of American invention, but improved and extended, all machinery and\r\ntools of every description being made by the firm's own workpeople.\r\n\r\n_Sewing Machines_.--The various improvements in these machines patented\r\nby Birmingham makers may be counted by the gross, and the machines sent\r\nout every year by the thousands. The button-hole machine was the\r\ninvention of Mr. Clements.\r\n\r\n_Sheathing Metal_.--In a newspaper called _The World_, dated April 16,\r\n1791, was an advertisement beginning thus--\"By the King's patent,\r\n_tinned copper_ sheets and pipes manufactured and sold by Charles Wyatt,\r\nBirmingham, and at 19, Abchurch lane, London.\" It was particularly\r\nrecommended for sheathing of ships, as the tin coating would prevent the\r\ncorrosion of the copper and operate as \"a preservative of the iron\r\nplaced contiguous to it.\" Though an exceedingly clever man, and the son\r\nof one of Birmingham's famed worthies, Mr. Charles Wyatt was not\r\nfortunate in many of his inventions, and his tinned copper brought him\r\nin neither silver nor gold. What is now known as sheathing or \"yellow\"\r\nmetal is a mixture of copper, zinc, and iron in certain defined\r\nproportions, according as it is \"Muntz's metal,\" or \"Green's patent,\"\r\n&c. Several patents were taken out in 1779, 1800, and at later dates,\r\nand, as is usual with \"good things,\" there has been sufficient\r\nsquabbling over sheathing to provide a number of legal big-wigs with\r\nconsiderable quantities of the yellow, metal _they_ prefer. George\r\nFrederick Muntz, M.P., if not the direct inventor, had the lion's share\r\nof profit in the manufacture, as the good-will of his business was sold\r\nfor £40,000 in 1863, at which time it was estimated that 11,000 tons of\r\nMuntz's mixture was annually made into sheathing, ships' bolts, &c., to\r\nthe value of over £800,000. The business was taken to by a limited\r\nliability company, whose capital in March, 1884, was £180,000, on which\r\na 10 per cent, dividend was realised. Elliott's Patent Sheathing and\r\nMetal Co. was formed in.1862.\r\n\r\n_Snuff-boxes_.--A hundred years ago, when snuff-taking was the _mode_,\r\nthe manufacture of japanned, gilt, and other snuff-boxes gave employment\r\nto large numbers here. Of one of these workmen it is recorded that he\r\nearned £3 10s. per week painting snuff-boxes at 1/4d. each. The first\r\nmention of their being made here is in 1693.\r\n\r\n_Soap_.--In more ways than one there is a vast deal of \"soft soap\" used\r\nin Birmingham, but its inhabitants ought to be cleanly people, for the\r\ntwo or three manufactories of hard yellow and mottled in and near the\r\ntown turn out an annual supply of over 3,000 tons.\r\n\r\n_Spectacles_.--Sixty and seventy years ago spectacles were sent out by\r\nthe gross to all part of the country, but they were of a kind now known\r\nas \"goggles,\" the frames being large and clumsy, and made of silver,\r\nwhite metal, or tortoise-shell, the fine steel wire frames now used not\r\nbeing introduced until about 1840.\r\n\r\n_Stereoscopes_, the invention of Sir David Brewster, were first made in\r\nthis town, Mr. Robert Field producing them.\r\n\r\n_Steel Pens_.--Though contrary to the general belief, metallic pens are\r\nof very ancient origin. Dr. Martin Lister, in his book of Travels,\r\npublished in 1699, described a \"very curious and antique writing\r\ninstrument made of thick and strong silver wire, wound up like a hollow\r\nbottom or screw, with both the ends pointing one way, and at a distance,\r\nso that a man might easily put his forefinger between the two points,\r\nand the screw fills the ball of his hand. One of the points was the\r\npoint of a bodkin, which was to write on waxed tables; the other point\r\nwas made very artificially, like the head and upper beak of a cock and\r\nthe point divided in two, just like our steel pens, from whence\r\nundoubtedly the moderns had their patterns; which are now made also of\r\nfine silver or gold, or Prince's metal, all of which yet want a spring\r\nand are therefore not so useful as of steel or a quill: but the quill\r\nsoon spoils. Steel is undoubtedly the best, and if you use China ink,\r\nthe most lasting of all inks, it never rusts the pen, but rather\r\npreserves it with a kind of varnish, which dries upon it, though you\r\ntake no care in wiping it.\"--Though Messrs. Gillott and Sons' Victoria\r\nWorks, Graham Street, stands first among the pen-making establishments\r\nopen to the visit of strangers, it is by no means the only manufactory\r\nwhereat the useful little steel pen is made in large quantities, there\r\nbeing, besides, Mr. John Mitchell (Newhall Street), Mr. William Mitchell\r\n(Cumberland Street), Hinks, Wells and Co. (Buckingham Street), Brandauer\r\nand Co. (New John Street, West), Baker and Finnemore (James Street), G.\r\nW. Hughes (St. Paul's Square), Leonardt and Co. (Charlotte Street),\r\nMyers and Son (Charlotte Street), Perry and Co. (Lancaster Street),\r\nRyland and Co. (St. Paul's Square). Sansum and Co. (Tenby Street), &c.,\r\nthe gross aggregate output of the trade at large being estimated at 20\r\ntons per week.\r\n\r\n_Stirrups_.--According to the Directory, there are but four stirrup\r\nmakers here, though it is said there are 4,000 different patterns of the\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n_Swords_.--Some writers aver that Birmingham was the centre of the metal\r\nworks of the ancient Britons, where the swords and the scythe blades\r\nwere made to meet Julius Cæsar. During the Commonwealth, over 15,000\r\nswords were said to have been made in Birmingham for the Parliamentary\r\nsoldiers, but if they thus helped to overthrow the Stuarts at that\r\nperiod, the Brummagem boys in 1745 were willing to make out for it by\r\nsupplying Prince Charlie with as many as ever he could pay for, and the\r\nbasket-hilts were at a premium. Disloyalty did not always prosper\r\nthough, for on one occasion over 2,000 Cutlasses intended for the\r\nPrince, were seized _en route_ and found their way into the hands of his\r\nenemies. Not many swords are made in Birmingham at the present time,\r\nunless matchets and case knives used in the plantations can be included\r\nunder that head.\r\n\r\n_Thimbles_, or thumbells, from being originally worn on the thumb, are\r\nsaid by the Dutch to have been the invention of Mynheer van Banschoten\r\nfor the protection of his lady-love's fingers when employed at the\r\nembroidery-frame; but though the good people of Amsterdam last year\r\n(1884) celebrated the bicentenary of their gallant thimble-making\r\ngoldsmith, it is more than probable that he filched the idea from a\r\nBirmingham man, for Shakespeare had been dead sixty-eight years prior to\r\n1684, and he made mention of thimbles as quite a common possession of\r\nall ladies in his time:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"For your own ladies, and pale-visag'd maids,\r\n  Like Amazons, come tripping after drums,\r\n  Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change;\r\n  Their neelds to lances.\"\r\n\r\n  _King John_, Act v. sc. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble.\"\r\n  \"And that I'll prove upon thee, though thy\r\n  little finger be armed in a thimble,\"\r\n\r\n  _Taming of the Shrew_, Act iv., sc. 3.\r\n\r\nThe earliest note we really have of thimbles being manufactured in\r\nBirmingham dates as 1695. A very large trade is now done in steel,\r\nbrass, gold, and silver.\r\n\r\n_Thread_.--Strange are the mutations of trade. The first thread of\r\ncotton spun by rollers, long before Arkwright's time, was made near this\r\ntown in the year 1700, and a little factory was at work in the Upper\r\nPriory (the motive power being two donkeys), in 1740, under the\r\ningenious John Wyatt, with whom were other two well-remembered local\r\nworthies--Lewis Paul and Thomas Warren. Many improvements were made in\r\nthe simple machinery, but fate did not intend Birmingham to rival\r\nBradford, and the thread making came to an end in 1792.\r\n\r\n_Tinderboxes_, with the accompanying \"fire steels,\" are still made here\r\nfor certain foreign markets, where lucifers are not procurable.\r\n\r\n_Tinning_.--Iron pots were first tinned in 1779, under Jonathan Taylor's\r\npatent. Tinning wire is one of the branches of trade rapidly going out,\r\npartly through the introduction of the galvanising process, but latterly\r\nin consequence of the invention of \"screw,\" \"ball,\" and other bottle\r\nstoppers. There were but five or six firms engaged in it ten years back,\r\nbut the then demand for bottling-wire may be gathered from the fact that\r\none individual, with the aid of two helpers, covered with the\r\nlighter-coloured metal about 2cwt. of slender iron wire per day. This\r\nwould give a total length of about 6,500 miles per annum, enough to tie\r\nup 25,718,784 bottles of pop, &c.\r\n\r\n_Tools_--The making of tools for the workers in our almost countless\r\ntrades has given employ to many thousands, but in addition thereto is\r\nthe separate manufacture of \"heavy edge tools.\" Light edge tools, such\r\nas table and pocket knives, scissors, gravers, &c., are not made here,\r\nthough \"heavy\" tools comprising axes, hatchets, cleavers, hoes, spades,\r\nmattocks, forks, chisels, plane irons, machine knives, scythes, &c., in\r\nendless variety and of hundreds of patterns, suited to the various parts\r\nof the world for which they are required. Over 4,000 hands are employed\r\nin this manufacture.\r\n\r\n_Tubes_.--Immense quantities (estimated at over 15,000 tons) of copper,\r\nbrass, iron, and other metal tubing are annually sent out of our\r\nworkshops. In olden days the manufacture of brass and copper tubes was\r\nby the tedious process of rolling up a strip of metal and soldering the\r\nedges together. In 1803 Sir Edward Thomason introduced the \"patent\r\ntube\"--iron body with brass coating, but it was not until 1838 that Mr.\r\nCharles Green took out his patent for \"seamless\" tubes, which was much\r\nimproved upon in 1852 by G. F. Muntz, junr., as well as by Mr. Thos.\r\nAttwood in 1850, with respect to the drawing of copper tubes. The Peyton\r\nand Peyton Tube Co., London Works, was registered June 25, 1878, capital\r\n£50,000 in £5 shares. Messrs. Peyton received 1,000 paid-up shares for\r\ntheir patent for machinery for manufacturing welded and other tubes,\r\n£3,500 for plant and tools, the stock going at valuation.\r\n\r\n_Tutania Metal_ took its name from Tutin, the inventor. It was much used\r\na hundred years ago, in the manufacture of buckles.\r\n\r\n_Umbrellas_.--The name of the man who first carried an umbrella in this\r\ntown (about the year 1780) has not yet been enrolled among our\r\n\"Birmingham Worthies,\" but he must have been known to some of our\r\nfathers, for it is not much more than 100 years ago since Jonas Hanway\r\nwalked down the Strand, shielding his wig from the wet with the first\r\numbrella seen in London. The metal work required for setting-up,\r\ntechnically called \"furniture,\" has long been made here, and gives\r\nemployment to about 1,700 hands, two-thirds of whom are females.\r\n\r\n_Vinegar_.--Fardon's Vinegar Brewery, Glover Street, is worth a visit,\r\nif only to look at their five vats, each upwards of 30ft. high and 24ft.\r\nin diameter, and each capable of storing 58,000 gallons. But, besides\r\nthese, among the largest of their kind in the world, there are thirteen\r\n24,000 gallons vats, five 15,000, and twenty seven 10,000.\r\n\r\n_Vitriol_.--The Oil of Vitriol in 1800 was reduced from 3s. per lb. to\r\n1s.; in 1865 it was sold at 1d.\r\n\r\n_Watchmaking_.--Few names of eminent horologists are to be found in the\r\nlists of departed tradesmen; so few indeed that watchmaking would seem\r\nto have been one of the unknown arts, if such a thing was possible at\r\nany period of the last two hundred years of Birmingham history. Messrs.\r\nBrunner (Smallbrook Street), Swinden (Temple Street), and Ehrardt (Barr\r\nStreet West) take the lead at present among private firms, but the\r\nintroduction of a watch manufactory is due to Mr. A L. Dennison, who,\r\nthough not the originator of the notion, after establishing factories in\r\nAmerica (in or about 1850) and Switzerland, came to this country in\r\n1871, and, with other gentlemen in the following year started the\r\nAnglo-American Watch Co. (Limited), a factory being erected in Villa\r\nStreet. The trade of the Co. was principally with America, which was\r\nsupplied with machine-made \"works\" from here until the Waltham, Elgin,\r\nand other firms over there beat them out of the market, a not very\r\ndifficult operation, considering that our fair-trading cousins impose a\r\n25 per cent. duty on all such goods sent there by the free-traders of\r\nthis country. The Villa Street establishment was purchased in 1875 by\r\nMr. William Bragge, who developed the business under the name of The\r\nEnglish Watch Co., the manufacture being confined almost solely to\r\nEnglish Lever watches, large and small sized, key-winding and keyless.\r\nIn January, 1882, Mr. Bragge, for the sum of £21,000 parted with the\r\nbusiness, plant, stock, and premises, to the present English Watch Co.\r\n(Limited), which has a registered capital of £50,000 in shares of £10\r\neach, the dividend (June, 1884) being at the rate of 6 per cent. on\r\npaid-up capital.--In April, 1883, the prospectus of The English Double\r\nChronograph Co. (Limited) was issued, the capital being £50,000 in £10\r\nshares, the object of the company being to purchase (for £15,000) and\r\nwork the patents granted to Mr. W. H. Douglas, of Stourbridge, for\r\nimprovements in chronographs, the improvements being of such a nature\r\nthat ordinary keyless English levers can be turned into double\r\nchronographs at a trifling cost.\r\n\r\n_Whipmaking_, as a trade distinct from saddlery, dates from about 1750,\r\nand it received a great impetus by the introduction, in 1780, of a\r\nmachine by Matthew Dean for the easier manipulation of the leather\r\nthongs.\r\n\r\n_Whistles_ of all sizes and sorts, from the child's tin whistle to the\r\nhuge and powerful steam whistles used on board the American liners, are\r\nmade in this town, and it might be imagined there could be but little\r\nnovelty in any new design. This, however, is not the case, for when the\r\nauthorities of Scotland Yard (June, 1884) desired a new police whistle,\r\nsamples were sent in from many parts of the country, from America, and\r\nfrom the Continent. The order, which was for 40,000, was secured by\r\nMessrs. J. Hudson and Co., Buckingham Street, and so distinct is the\r\nspeciality, that fifty other places have followed the example of the\r\nMetropolis.\r\n\r\n_Wire_.--Wire-drawing, which formerly had to be done by hand, does not\r\nappear to have been made into a special trade earlier than the beginning\r\nof the 18th century, the first wire mill we read of being that of Penns,\r\nnear Sutton Coldfield, which was converted from an iron forge in 1720.\r\nSteel wire was not made till some little time after that date. The\r\nincreased demand for iron and steel wire which has taken, place during\r\nthe last 35 years is almost incredible, the make in 1850 being not more\r\nthan 100 tons: in 1865 it was calculated at 2,000 tons, in 1875 it was\r\nput at 12,000 tons, while now it is estimated to equal 30,000 tons. In\r\nMarch 1853, a piece of No. 16 copper wire was shown at Mr. Samuel\r\nWalker's in one piece, three miles long, drawn from a bar 6/8ths in\r\ndiameter. Originally the bar weighed 128 lbs, but it lost 14lbs in the\r\nprocess, and it was then thought a most remarkable production, but far\r\nmore wonderful specimens of wire-spinning have since been exhibited. A\r\nwire rope weighing over 70 tons, was made in 1876 at the Universe Works,\r\nof Messrs. Wright, who are the patentees of the mixed wire and hemp\r\nrope. Birdcages, meat covers, mouse traps, wire blinds, wire nails, wire\r\nlatticing, &c., we have long been used to; even girding the earth with\r\nland and ocean telegraph wire, or fencing in square miles at a time of\r\nprairie land, with wire strong enough to keep a herd of a few thousand\r\nbuffaloes in range, are no longer novelties, but to shape, sharpen, and\r\npolish a serviceable pair of penny scissors out of a bit of steel wire\r\nby two blows and the push of a machine, _is_ something new, and it is\r\nNettlefold's latest.\r\n\r\n_Wire Nails, Staples, &c._, are made at Nettlefold's by machinery much\r\nin advance of what can ba seen elsewhere. In the nail mill the \"Paris\r\npoints\" as wire nails are called, are cut from the coil of wire by the\r\nfirst motion of the machine as it is fed in, then headed and pointed at\r\none operation, sizes up to one inch being turned out at the rate of 360\r\na minute. In the manufacture of spikes, the punch for making the head is\r\npropelled by springs, which are compressed by a cam, and then released\r\nat each stroke; two cutters worked by side cams on the same shaft cut\r\noff the wire and make the point. A steel finger then advances and knocks\r\nthe finished spike out of the way to make room for the next. Wire\r\nstaples, three inches long, are turned out at the rate of a hundred a\r\nminute; the wire is pushed forward into the machine and cut off on the\r\nbevel to form the points; a hook rises, catches the wire, and draws it\r\ndown into the proper form, when a staple falls out complete.\r\n\r\n_Wire Gauge_.--The following table shows the sizes, weights, lengths,\r\nand breaking strains of iron wire under the Imperial Standard Wire\r\nGauge, which came into operation March 1, 1884--\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSize |   DIAMETER  | Sectional | WEIGHT OF   | Length | BREAKING STRAINS\r\non   | ------------|  area in  |-----------  | of     | ----------------\r\nWire | Inch Mille- |    Sq.    |100    Mile  | Cwt.   | Annealed |Bright\r\nGauge|      metres | Inches    |Yards        |        |          |\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                lbs.   lbs.     yds.      lbs.     lbs.\r\n7/0   .500    12.7    .1963     193.4  3404     58       10470    15700\r\n6/0   .464    11.8    .1691     166.5  2930     67        9017    13525\r\n5/0   .432    11.     .1466     144.4  2541     78        7814    11725\r\n4/0   .400    10.2    .1257     123.8  2179     91        6702    10052\r\n3/0   .372     9.4    .1087     107.1  1885    105        5796     8694\r\n2/0   .348     8.8    .0951      93.7  1649    120        5072     7608\r\n1/0   .342     8.2    .0824      81.2  1429    138        4397     6595\r\n  1   .300     7.6    .0598      69.6  1225    161        3770     5655\r\n  2   .276     7.     .0598      58.9  1037    190        3190     4785\r\n  3   .252     6.4    .0499      49.1   864    228        2660     3990\r\n  4   .232     5.9    .0423      41.6   732    269        2254     3381\r\n  5   .212     5.4    .0365      34.8   612    322        1883     2824\r\n  6   .192     4.9    .0290      28.5   502    393        1644     2316\r\n  7   .176     4.5    .0243      24.    422    467        1298     1946\r\n  8   .160     4.1    .0201      19.8   348    566        1072     1608\r\n  9   .144     3.7    .0163      16.    282    700         869     1303\r\n 10   .128     3.3    .0129      12.7   223    882         687     1030\r\n 11   .116     3.     .0106      10.4   183   1077         564      845\r\n 12   .104     2.6    .0085       8.4   148   1333         454      680\r\n 13   .092     2.3    .0066       6.5   114   1723         355      532\r\n 14   .080     2.     .0050       5.     88   2240         268      402\r\n 15   .072     1.8    .0041       4.     70   2800         218      326\r\n 16   .064     1.6    .0032       3.2    56   3500         172      257\r\n 17   .056     1.4    .0025       2.4    42   4667         131      197\r\n 18   .048     1.2    .0018       1.8    31   6222          97      145\r\n 19   .040     1.     .0013       1.2    21   9333          67      100\r\n 20   .036      .9    .0010       1.     18  11200          55       82\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yates_.--At one period this was the favourite slang term of the\r\nsmashing fraternity for the metal used in their nefarious business, the\r\nspoons manufactured by Messrs. Yates and Son being the best material for\r\ntransmutation into base coin.\r\n\r\n~Trafalgar.~--See \"_Nelson_\" and \"_Statues_.\"\r\n\r\n~Train Bands.~--The Trainbands of former days may be likened to the\r\nmilitia of the present time, but were drawn from every parish in the\r\nhundreds, according to the population. A document in the lost Staunton\r\nCollection, gave the names and parishes of the men forming \"Lord\r\nCompton's Company of Foot for the Hundred of Hemlingford\" in 1615, being\r\npart of the \"Warwickshire Trayue Bands.\" Birmingham supplied six men\r\narmed with pikes and six with muskets; Birmingham and Aston jointly the\r\nsame number; Edgbaston one pike; Coleshill three of each; Sutton\r\nColdfield. four pikes and six muskets; Solihull three pikes and four\r\nmuskets; Knowle the same; Berkswell two pikes and five muskets; and\r\nMeriden one pike and two muskets. These Trained Bands numbered 6OO men\r\nfrom Coventry and the county in 1642, besides the Militia and Volunteers\r\nof Warwickshire, which were called up in that year. These latter\r\nmustered very strongly on the days for review and training, there being\r\nat Stratford-upon-Avon (June 30) 400 Volunteers well armed and 200\r\nunarmed; at Warwick (July 1 & 2) 650 well armed; at Coleshill (July 4)\r\n8OO almost all well armed; and at Coventry near 800 most well armed--the\r\ntotal number being 2,850, making a respectable force of 3,450 in all,\r\nready, according to the expression of their officers, \"to adhere to His\r\nMajestie and both Houses of Parliament, to the losse of the last drop of\r\ntheir dearest blood.\" These fine words, however, did not prevent the\r\n\"Voluntiers\" of this neighbourhood opposing His Majestie to the utmost\r\nof their power soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n~Tramways.~--These take their name from Mr. Outram, who, in 1802,\r\nintroduced the system of lightening carriage by running the vehicles on\r\nrail in the North of England. The first suggestion of a local tramway\r\ncame through Mr. G.F. Train, who not finding scope sufficient for his\r\nabilities in America, paid Birmingham a visit, and after yarning us well\r\nasked and obtained permission (Aug. 7, 1860) to lay down tram rails in\r\nsome of the principal thoroughfares, but as his glib tongue failed in\r\nprocuring the needful capital his scheme was a thorough failure. Some\r\nten years after the notion was taken up by a few local gentlemen, and at\r\na public meeting, on December 27, 1871, the Town Council were authorised\r\nto make such tramways as they thought to be necessary, a Company being\r\nformed to work them. This Company was rather before its time, though now\r\nit would be considered, if anything, rather backward. The first line of\r\nrails brought into use was laid from the buttom of Hockley Hill to\r\nDudley Port, and it was opened May 20, 1872; from Hockley to top of Snow\r\nHill the cars began to run September 7, 1873; the Bristol Road line\r\nbeing first used May 30, though formally opened June 5, 1876. The\r\nBirmingham and District Tramway Company's lines cost about £65,000, and\r\nthey paid the Corporation £910 per year rental, but in May, 1877, their\r\ninterest was bought up by the Birmingham Tramway and Omnibus Company for\r\nthe sum of £25,000, the original cost of the property thus acquired\r\nbeing £115,000. The new company leased the borough lines for seven years\r\nat £1,680 per annum, and gave up the out-district portion of the\r\noriginal undertaking. That they have been tolerably successful is shown\r\nby the fact that in 1883 the receipts from passengers amounted to\r\n£39,859, while the owners of the £10 shares received a dividend of 15\r\nper cent. The authorised capital of the company is £60,000, of which\r\n£33,600 has been called up. The Aston line from Corporation Street to\r\nthe Lower Grounds was opened for traffic the day after Christmas, 1882.\r\nThe Company's capital is £50,000, of which nearly one-half was expended\r\non the road alone. This was the first tramway on which steam was used as\r\nthe motive power, though Doune's locomotire was tried, Jan. 8, 1876,\r\nbetween Handsworth and West Bromwich, and Hughes's between Monmouth\r\nStreet and Bournbrook on July 2, 1880, the latter distance being covered\r\nin twenty-five minutes with a car-load of passengers attached to the\r\nengine. The next Company to be formed was tha South Staffordshire and\r\nBirmingham District Steam Tramway Co., who \"broke ground\" July 26, 1882,\r\nand opened their first section, about seven miles in length (from\r\nHandsworth to Darlaston), June 25, 1883. This line connects Birmingham\r\nwith West Bromwich, Wednesbury, Great Bridge, Dudley, Walsall, and\r\nintermediate places, and is worked with 40-horse power engines of\r\nWilkinson's make. The Birmingham and West Suburban Tramways Co.'s lines,\r\ncommencing in Station Street run, by means of branches from several\r\nparts, to various of the suburbs:--1st, by way of Pershore Street, Moat\r\nRow, Bradford Street, and Moseley Road, to Moseley; 2nd, by way of\r\nDeritend, Bordesley, Camp Hill, along Stratford Road, to Sparkhill; 3rd,\r\nleaving Stratford Road (at the Mermaid) and along Warwick Road, to\r\nAcock's Green; 4th, striking off at Bordesley, along the Coventry Road\r\nto the far side of Small Heath Park; 5th, from Moat Row, by way of\r\nSmithfield Street to Park Street, Duddeston Row, Curzon Street, Vauxhall\r\nRoad, to Nechells Park Road; 6th, in the same direction, by way of Gosta\r\nGreen, Lister Street, and Great Lister Street, using \"running powers\"\r\nover the Aston line where necessary on the last-named and following\r\nroutes; 7th from Corporation Street, along Aston Street, Lancaster\r\nStreet, Newtown Row, up the Birchfield Road; 8th, from Six Ways,\r\nBirchfield, along the Lozells Road to Villa Cross, and from the Lozells\r\nRoad along Wheeler Street to Constitution Hill, forming a junction with\r\nthe original Hockley and Snow Hill line. The system of lines projected\r\nby the Western Districts Co., include: 1st, commencing in Edmund Street,\r\nnear the Great Western Railway Station, along Congreve Street, Summer\r\nRow, Parade, Frederick Street, and Vyse Street, to join the Hockley\r\nline; 2nd, as before to Parade, along the Sandpits, Spring Hill to\r\nborough boundary in Dudley Road, and along Heath Street to Smethwick;\r\n3rd, as before to Spring Hill, thence in one direction along Monument\r\nRoad to Hagley Road, and in the opposite direction along Icknield Street\r\nto Hockley; 4th, starting from Lower Temple Street, along Hill Street,\r\nHurst Street, Sherlock Street to the borough boundary in Pershore Road,\r\nand from Sherlock Street, by way of Gooch Street, to Balsall Heath; 5th,\r\nby way of Holloway Head, Bath Row, and Islington to the Five Ways. The\r\nwhole of the lines now in use and being constructed in the Borough are\r\nthe property of the Corporation, who lease them to the several\r\nCompanies, the latter making the lines outside the borough themselves,\r\nand keeping them in repair. The average cost of laying down is put at\r\n50s. per yard for single line, or £5 per yard for double lines, the cost\r\nof the metal rail itself being about 20s. per yard.\r\n\r\n~Trees in Streets.~--Though a few trees were planted along the Bristol\r\nRoad in 1853, and a few others later in some of the outskirts, the\r\nsystem cannot be fairly said to have started till the spring of 1876,\r\nwhen about 100 plane trees were planted in Broad Street, 100 limes in\r\nBristol Street, 20 Canadian poplars in St. Martin's church-yard, a score\r\nor so of plane trees near Central Station, and a number in Gosta Green\r\nand the various playgrounds belonging to Board Schools, a few elms,\r\nsycamores, and Ontario poplars being mixed with them. As a matter of\r\nhistorical fact, the first were put in the ground Nov. 29, 1885, in\r\nStephenson Place.\r\n\r\n~Tunnels.~--The tunnel on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, near\r\nKing's Norton, is 2,695 yards long, perfectly straight, 17-1/2-ft. wide,\r\nand 18-ft. high. In the centre a basin is excavated sufficiently wide\r\nfor barges to pass without inconvenience; and in this underground\r\nchamber in August, 1795, the Royal Arch Masons held a regular chapter of\r\ntheir order, rather an arch way of celebrating the completion of the\r\nundertaking. The other tunnels on this canal are 110, 120, 406, and 524\r\nyards in length. On the old Birmingham Canal there are two, one being\r\n2,200 yards long and the other 1,010 yards. On the London and Birmingham\r\nRailway (now London and North Western) the Watford tunnel is 1,830 yards\r\nlong, the Kisley tunnel 2,423 yards, and Primrose Hill 1,250 yards. On\r\nthe Great Western line the longest is the Box tunnel, 3,123 yards in\r\nlength. The deepest tunnel in England pierces the hills between Great\r\nMalvern and Herefordshire, being 600ft. from the rails to the surface;\r\nit is 1,560 yards in length. The longest tunnels in the country run\r\nunder the range of hills between Marsden in Yorkshire and Diggle in\r\nLancashire, two being for railway and one canal use. One of the former\r\nis 5,434 yards, and the other (Stanedge, on the L. & N.W.) 5,435 yards\r\nlong, while the canal tunnel is 5,451 yards.\r\n\r\n~Turnpike Gates.~--At one time there were gates or bars on nearly every\r\nroad out of the town. Even at the bottom of Worcester Street there was a\r\nbar across the road in 1818. There was once a gate at the junction of\r\nHang'sman Lane (our Great Hampton Row) and Constitution Hill, which,\r\nbaing shifted further on, to about the spot where Green and Cadbury's\r\nWorks now are, remained till 1839. The gate in Deritend was removed in\r\nAugust, 1828; the one at Five Ways July 5, 1841; those at Small Heath,\r\nat Sparkbrook, in the Moseley Road, and in the Hagley Road were all\r\n\"free'd\" in 1851, and the sites of the toll houses sold in 1853. In the\r\n\"good old coaching days\" the turnpike tolls paid on a coach running\r\ndaily from here to London amounted to £1,428 per year.\r\n\r\n~Union Passage~, at first but a field path out of the yard of the Crown\r\nTavern to the Cherry Orchard, afterwards a narrow entry as far as\r\nCrooked Lane, with a house only at each end, was opened up and widened\r\nin 1823 by Mr. Jones, who built the Pantechnetheca. Near the Ball Street\r\nend was the Old Bear Yard, the premises of a dealer in dogs, rabbits,\r\npigeons, and other pets, who kept a big brown bear, which was taken out\r\nwhenever the Black Country boys wanted a bear-baiting. The game was put\r\na stop to in 1835, but the \"cage\" was there in 1841, about which time\r\nthe Passage became built up on both sides throughout.\r\n\r\n~Vaughton's Hole.~--An unfortunate soldier fell into a deep clay pit\r\nhere, in July, 1857, and was drowned; and about a month after (August 6)\r\na horse and cart, laden with street sweepings, was backed too near the\r\nedge, over-turned, and sank to the bottom of sixty feet deep of water.\r\nThe place was named after a very old local family who owned considerable\r\nproperty in the neighbourhood of Gooch Street, &c., though the\r\ndescendants are known as Houghtons.\r\n\r\n~Vauxhall.~--In an old book descriptive of a tour through England, in\r\n1766, it is mentioned that near Birmingham there \"is a seat belonging to\r\nSir Listen Holte, Bart, but now let out for a public house (opened June\r\n4, 1758), where are gardens, &c., with an organ and other music, in\r\nimitation of Vauxhall, by which name it goes in the neighbourhood.\" The\r\nold place, having been purchased by the Victoria Land Society, was\r\nclosed by a farewell dinner and ball, September, 16, 1850, the first\r\nstroke of the axe to the trees being given at the finish of the ball, 6\r\na.m. next morning. In the days of its prime, before busy bustling\r\nBirmingham pushed up to its walls, it ranked as one of the finest places\r\nof amusement anywhere out of London. The following verse (one of five)\r\nis from an \"Impromptu written by Edward Farmer in one of the alcoves at\r\nOld Vauxhall, March 6. 1850\":--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"There's scarce a heart that will not start,\r\n    No matter what it's rank and station,\r\n  And heave a sigh when they destroy,\r\n    This favourite place of recreation.\r\n  If we look back on memory's track,\r\n    What joyous scenes we can recall,\r\n  Of happy hours in its gay bowers,\r\n    And friends we met at Old Vauxhall!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Velocipedes.~--We call them \"cycles\" nowadays, but in 1816-20 they were\r\n\"dandy-horses,\" and in the words of a street billet of the period\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The hobby-horse was all the go\r\n  In country and in town.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n~Views of Birmingham.~--The earliest date \"view\" of the town appears to\r\nbe the one given in Dugdale's Warwickshire, of 1656, and entitled \"The\r\nProspect of Birmingham, from Ravenhurst (neere London Road), in the\r\nSouth-east part of the Towne.\"\r\n\r\n~Villa Cross~ was originally built for and occupied as a school, and\r\nknown as Aston Villa School.\r\n\r\n~Visitors of Distinction~ in the old Soho days, were not at all rare,\r\nthough they had not the advantages of travelling by rail. Every event of\r\nthe kind, however, was duly chronicled in the _Gazette_, but they must\r\nbe men of superior mark indeed, or peculiarly notorious perhaps, for\r\ntheir movements to be noted nowadays. Besides the \"royalties\" noted\r\nelsewhere, we were honoured with the presence of the Chinese\r\nCommissioner Pin-ta-Jen, May 7, 1866, and his Excellency the Chinese\r\nMinister Kus-ta Jen, January 23, 1878. Japanese Ambassadors were here\r\nMay 20, 1862, and again November 1, 1872. The Burmese Ambassadors took a\r\nlook at us August 14, 1872, and the Madagascar Ambassadors followed on\r\nJanuary 5, 1883.--Among the brave and gallant visitors who have noted\r\nare General Elliott, who came August 29th, 1787. Lord Nelson, August 30,\r\n1802, and there is an old Harborneite still living who says he can\r\nrecollect seeing the hero come out of the hotel in Temple Row. The Duke\r\nof Wellington and Sir Robert Peel dined at Dee's Hotel, September 23,\r\n1830. The Duke's old opponent, Marshal Soult, in July 1833, seemed\r\nparticularly interested in the work going on among our gun-shops. Lady\r\nHavelock, her two daughters, and General Havelock, the only surviving\r\nbrother of Sir Henry, visited the town October 8, 1858. General Ulysses\r\nGrant, American Ex-president, was soft-soaped at the Town Hall, October\r\n19, 1877.--Politicians include Daniel O'Connell, January 20, 1832. The\r\nRight Hon. Benjamin Disraeli, who visited the Small Arms Factory, August\r\n18, 1869, was again here August 22, 1876, immediately after being raised\r\nto the peerage as Earl of Beaconsfield. The Right Hon. W.E. Gladstone\r\nwas welcomed with a procession and a \"monster meeting\" at Bingley Hall.\r\nMay 31, 1877. The Right Hon. R.A. Cross, Home Secretary, honoured the\r\nConservatives by attending a banquet in the Town Hall, Nov. 20, 1876.\r\nSir Stafford Northcote, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, came here Oct.\r\n19, 1878, and was at Aston, Oct. 13, 1884, when the Radical roughs made\r\nthemselves conspicuous. Lord Randolph Churchill was introduced to the\r\nburgesses, April 15, 1884; and has been here many times since, as well\r\nas the late Col. Burnaby, who commenced his candidature for the\r\nrepresentation of the borough July 23, 1878.--In the long list of\r\nlearned and literary visitors occur the names of John Wesley, who first\r\ncame here in March, 1738, and preached on Gosta Green in 1743. Whitfield\r\npreached here in Oct., 1753. Benjamin Franklin was in Birmingham in\r\n1758, and for long afterwards corresponded with Baskerville and Boulton.\r\nFulton, the American engineer, (originally a painter) studied here in\r\n1795. Washington Irving, whose sister was married to Mr. Henry Van Wart,\r\nspent a long visit here, during the course of which he wrote the series\r\nof charming tales comprised in his \"Sketch Book.\" His \"Bracebridge\r\nHall,\" if not written, was conceived here, our Aston Hall being the\r\nprototype of the Hall, and the Bracebridge family of Atherstone found\r\nsome of the characters. Thomas Carlyle was here in 1824; Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBeecher Stowe (\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"), in May, 1853; Sir W. Crofton, Oct.\r\n9, 1862; M. Chevalier, April 28, 1875; Mr. Ruskin, July 14, 1877; Rev.\r\nDr. Punshon, March 19, and J.A. Froude, M.A., March 18, 1878; Mr.\r\nArchibald Forbes, April 29, 1878; H.M. Stanley, Nov. 6, 1878; Bret\r\nHarte, April 7, 1879; the Rev. T. de Wilt Talmage, an American preacher\r\nof great note, lectured in Town Hall June 9 and July 7, 1879, on \"The\r\nBright side of Things,\" and on \"Big Blunders;\" but, taking the brightest\r\nview he could, he afterwards acknowledged that his coming here was the\r\nbiggest blunder he had ever made. Oscar Wilde, March 13, 1884. Lola\r\nMontes lectured here March 2-4, 1859. Dr. Kenealy was here June 26,\r\n1875. The Tichborne Claimant showed himself at the Town Hall, August 26,\r\n1872, and again, \"after his exile,\" at the Birmingham Concert Hall, Jan.\r\n12, 1885.\r\n\r\n~Volunteers in the Olden Time.~--A meeting was held October 5, 1745, for\r\nthe raising of a regiment of volunteers to oppose the Scotch rebels, but\r\nhistory does not chronicle any daring exploits by this regiment. Playing\r\nat soldiers would seem to have been formerly a more popular (or shall we\r\nsay patriotic) amusement than of late years; for it is recorded that a\r\nlocal corps was organised in August, 1782, but we suppose it was\r\ndisbanded soon after, as in 1797, when the threatening times of\r\nrevolution alarmed our peaceful sires, there were formed in Birmingham\r\ntwo companies, one of horse and one of foot, each 500 strong, under the\r\ncommands of Capt. Pearson and Lord Brooke. They were called the\r\nBirmingham Loyal Association of Volunteers, and held their first parade\r\nin Coleshill Street, August 15, 1797. On the 4th of June following a\r\ngrand review was held on Birmingham Heath (then unenclosed) to the\r\ndelight of the local belles, who knew not which the most to admire, the\r\nscarlet horse or the blue foot. Over 100,000 spectators were said to\r\nhave been present, and, strangest thing of all, the Volunteers were\r\narmed with muskets brought from Prussia. The corps had the honour of\r\nescorting Lord Nelson when, with Lady Hamilton, he visited the town in\r\n1802. At a review on August 2, 1804, the regiment were presented with\r\nits colours, and for years the \"Loyals\" were the most popular men of the\r\nperiod. Our neighbours do not seem to have been more backward than the\r\nlocals, though why it was necessary that the services of the Handsworth\r\nVolunteer Cavalry should be required to charge and put to flight the\r\nrioters in Snow Hill (May 29, 1810) is not very clear.--See also \"_Train\r\nBands_.\"\r\n\r\n~Volunteers of the Present Day.~--The first official enrolment of\r\nVolunteers of the present corps, was dated Nov. 25, 1859, though a list\r\nof names was on paper some three months earlier. Unlike sundry other\r\nmovements which are now of a national character, that for the formation\r\nof a volunteer army was so far from having a local origin, that for a\r\nlong time it was viewed with anything but favour in Birmingham; and,\r\nthough it is not pleasant to record the fact, it was not until the\r\nlittle parish of Handsworth had raised its corps of the First\r\nStaffordshire, that the Brums really stepped into the ranks. Properly\r\nthe natal day should be reckoned as the 14th of December, 1859, when a\r\ntown's meeting was held \"for the purpose of adopting such measures as\r\nmight seem desirable for placing Birmingham in its proper position with\r\nregard to the great national rifle movement.\" The Hon. Charles Granvllle\r\nScott had been previously selected by Lord Leigh (the Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nthe County) as Colonel, Major Sanders had accepted the Captaincy, Mr.\r\nJ.O. Mason been appointed Lieutenant, and 111 names entered on the roll\r\nof members of the 1st Company, but it was not till the above-named day\r\nthat the movement really made progress, the Mayor (Mr. Thos. Lloyd), Sir\r\nJohn Ratcliff, Mr. A. Dixon, and Mr. J. Lloyd each then promising to\r\nequip his twenty men apiece, and sundry other gentlemen aiding to dress\r\nup others of the rank and file. The money thus being found the men were\r\nsoon forthcoming too, the end of the year showing 320 names on the roll\r\ncall, a number increased to 1,080 by the close of 1860. The latter year\r\nsaw the first parade in Calthorpe Park, the opening of the range at\r\nBournebrook, and the formation of the twelve companies forming the first\r\nbattalion, but, notwithstanding many liberal donations (the gunmakers\r\ngiving £850), and the proceeds of the first annual ball, it closed with\r\nthe corps being in debt over £1,000. On the formation of the 2nd county\r\nbattalion, Col. Scott took command thereof, Major Sanders being\r\npromoted. He was followed by Lieut.-Col. Mason, on whose resignation, in\r\nFebruary, 1867, Major Ratcliff succeeded, the battalion being then 1,161\r\nstrong. Col. Ratcliff retired in June, 1871, and was replaced by\r\nMajor-General Hinde, C.B., who held command until his death, March 1,\r\n1881. Major Gem who temporarily acted as commander, also died the\r\nfollowing Nov. 4, Major Burt filling the post till the appointment of\r\nCol. W. Swynfen Jervis. The first adjutant (appointed in 1860) was\r\nCaptain McInnis, who retired in 1870, having received bodily injuries\r\nthrough being thrown from his horse; he was succeeded by the present\r\nAdjutant-Colonel Tarte. The first uniform of the corps was a grey tunic\r\nwith green facings, and a peaked cap with cock's feathers; in 1863 this\r\nwas changed for a green uniform with red facings, similar to that worn\r\nby the 60th Rifles, with the exception of a broad red stripe on the\r\ntrousers. The trouser stripe was done away with in 1875, when also the\r\ncap and feathers gave place to the busby and glengarry, the latter in\r\n1884 being exchanged for the regulation army helmet, and soon perhaps\r\nour boys will all be seen in scarlet like their brothers of the\r\nStaffordshire battalions. At no date since its enrolment has the\r\nbattalion been free from debt, and it now owes about £1,300, a state of\r\naffairs hardly creditable to the town which sends out yearly, some\r\nhalf-million firearms from its manufactories. The annual balls did not\r\nbecome popular, the last taking place in 1864; bazaars were held October\r\n14-17, 1863, and October 24-27, 1876; athletic displays have been given\r\n(the first in May, 1865), and the cap has been sent round more than\r\nonce, but the debt--it still remains. At the Volunteer Review, July 24,\r\n1861, before the Duke of Cambridge; at the Hyde Park Review, June, 1865,\r\nbefore the Prince of Wales; at the Midland Counties' Review at Derby,\r\nJune, 1867; at the Royal Review at Windsor in 1868; and at every\r\ninspection since, the Birmingham corps has merited and received the\r\nhighest praise for general smartness and efficiency; it is one of the\r\ncrack corps of the kingdom, and at the present time (end of 1884) has\r\nnot one inefficient member out of its 1,200 rank and file, but yet the\r\ntown is not Liberal enough to support it properly. The first march-out\r\nof 720 to Sutton took place June 21, 1875, others joining at the camp,\r\nmaking over 800 being under canvas, 744 attending the review. The\r\ncamping-out at Streetly Wood has annually recurred since that date; the\r\nfirst sham fight took place June 20, 1877. The \"coming-of-age\" was\r\ncelebrated by a dinner at the Midland Hotel, January 29, 1881, up to\r\nwhich time the Government grants had amounted to £26,568 14s., the local\r\nsubscriptions to £8,780, and the donations to £1,956 1s. 3d. The\r\nBirmingham Rifle Corps is now known as the First Volunteer Battalion of\r\nthe Royal Warwickshire Regiment, having been linked to the \"Saucy\r\nSixth,\" under the army scheme of 1873.--See \"_Public Buildings_--_Drill\r\nHall_.\"\r\n\r\n~Von Beck.~--The Baroness Von Beck was a lady intimately connected with\r\nthe chiefs of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and appears to have been\r\nemployed by them in various patriotic services. In 1851 she visited\r\nBirmingham and was a welcome guest until \"someone blundered\" and charged\r\nher with being an impostor. On the evening of August 29, she and her\r\ncopatriot, Constant Derra de Moroda, were arrested at the house of Mr.\r\nTyndall and locked up on suspicion of fraud. Her sudden death in the\r\npolice-court next morning put a stop to the case; but an action\r\nresulted, in which George Dawson and some friends were cast for heavy\r\ndamages as a salve for the injured honour of M. de Moroda.\r\n\r\n~Wages and Work.~--In 1272 the wages of a labouring man was just 1-1/2\r\nd. per day. In Henry VIII.'s reign labourers' wages averaged 4d. per\r\nday; skilled workmen 5-1/2d. per day. The penny at that time was equal\r\nto a shilling of the present day, and would, relatively, purchase as\r\nmuch. In 1682, the Justices of the Peace assembled in Quarter Sessions\r\nat Warwick fixed the rates of wages to be paid to the several classes of\r\nartificers, labourers, and others, as enjoined by a statue of Elizabeth.\r\nFrom their order then made, we find that a master carpenter, his\r\nservants, and journeymen, were to receive 1s each per day; a master\r\nbricklayer, a mason, a cartwright, a thatcher, a tyler, a mower, and a\r\nreaper also 1s. per day, other workmen and labourers averaging from 4d.\r\nto 8d. per day, but none of them to receive more than half these rates\r\nif their meat and drink was found them. The hours of work to be from\r\nfive in the morning till half-past seven at night. Any person refusing\r\nto work upon these terms was to be imprisoned, and anyone paying more to\r\nforfeit £5 in addition to ten days' imprisonment, the unfortunate\r\nindividual receiving such extra wages to suffer in like manner for\r\ntwenty-one days. In 1777, there was a row among the tailors, which led\r\nto what may be called the first local strike. The unfortunate \"knights\r\nof the thimble\" only got 12s. to 14s. per week.\r\n\r\n~Warstone Lane~ takes its name from the Hoarstone, supposed to have been\r\nan ancient boundary mark, which formerly stood at the corner of the lane\r\nand Icknield Street, and which is now preserved within the gateway\r\nentrance to the Church of England cemetery. Hutton says that in 1400\r\nthere was a castle, with a moat round it, in Warstone Lane. The lane has\r\nalso been called Deadman's Lane, and considering the proximity of the\r\ncemetery that name might even now be applicable.\r\n\r\n~Warwick House~, as it now stands was began in 1839 or 1840; formerly it\r\nwas composted of two cottages, one with a bit of garden ground in front,\r\nwhich underwent the usual transformation scene of being first covered in\r\nthen built upon.\r\n\r\n~Warwickshire~, the county in which Birmingham is situated, has a total\r\narea of 566,458 acres, of which 283,946 acres are permanent pasture\r\nlands, and 210,944 acres under crops or arable land. In 1882 the live\r\nstock in the country, as returned by the occupiers of land, included\r\n29,508 horses, 5,503 being kept solely for breeding; 93,334 cattle;\r\n218,355 sheep; and 41,832 pigs.\r\n\r\n~Warwick Castle~ is open to visitors every day, except Sunday; when the\r\nfamily are absent from home, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., but if they are at\r\nhome, from 9 to 10 a.m. only.\r\n\r\n~Warwick Vase.~--The bronze copy in Aston Hall was cast by Sir Richard\r\nThomason.\r\n\r\n~Warwickshire Regiment.~--The 6th Foot recruited in this county in 1778\r\nso successfully that it was called \"The Warwickshire,\" Birmingham\r\nsupplying the largest proportion of the men, and raising by public\r\nsubscription £2,000 towards their equipment. Under Lord Cardwell's army\r\nlocalisation plan of 1873, the regiment is now called the 1st Royal\r\nWarwickshire, and, with the Warwickshire Militia and Volunteers, forms\r\nthe 28th Brigade.\r\n\r\n~Watch House.~--On the right hand side of Crooked Lane from High Street,\r\nmay still be seen the old Watch House, where, fifty years ago, the\r\n\"Charleys,\" or night watchmen, took any drunken or disorderly\r\ncharacters, or night prowlers, they happened to meet with, or whom they\r\ndare tackle.\r\n\r\n~Waterloo Veterans.~--John McKay was born in November, 1792, and entered\r\nthe army as a drummerboy in 1803; he died here in July, 1879. He served\r\n41 years, and was for the last 25 years of his life office keeper of the\r\nRoyal Engineers' Office in this town. Another \"Waterloo man,\" George\r\nTaylor, died here, November 6, 1880, aged 98.\r\n\r\n~Water Pipes.~--In 1810 Mr. Murdoch started a Company for manufacturing\r\nstone pipes for water-works, and they made a large quantity, which were\r\nlaid down in London and Manchester, but they had to come up again, as\r\nthe pipes split--and the Company burst.\r\n\r\n~Waterspouts and Whirlwinds~ are not of common occurrence hereabouts.\r\nOne of the former burst over the Lickey Hills, April 13, 1792, the\r\nresulting flood reaching to Bromsgrove. A whirlwind at Coleshill, April\r\n4, 1877, played havoc with some hay-ricks, hedges, trees, &c.\r\n\r\n~Water Street~, formerly Water Lane, had a brook running down one side\r\nof it when houses were first built there.\r\n\r\n~Weather Cocks.~--Mention is made of Weather Cocks as early as the ninth\r\ncentury, and it has been supposed that the Cock was intended as an\r\nemblem of the vigilance of the clergy, who irreverently styled\r\nthemselves the Cocks of the Almighty, their duty being, like the cock\r\nwhich roused Peter, to call the people to repentance, or at any rate to\r\nchurch. These are the longest-lived birds we know of. The one which had\r\nbeen perched on the old spire of St. Martin's for a hundred years or\r\nmore was brought down July 22, 1853, and may still be seen at Aston\r\nHall, along with the old bird that tumbled off Aston church October 6,\r\n1877. The last was made of copper in July, 1830, and contained, among\r\nother articles, a copy of Swinney's _Birmingham Chronicle_ of June 29,\r\n1815, with a full account of the Battle of Waterloo.\r\n\r\n~Weighing Machines~ were introduced by John Wyatt, in 1761, and the\r\nfirst was purchased by the Overseers in 1767, so that the profits might\r\nreduce the poor rates. It was situated at the top corner of Snow Hill,\r\nand so much did the Overseers value it, that they gave notice, (Feb.\r\n18th, 1783) of their intention of applying to Parliament for the\r\nmonopoly of securing \"the benefit of weighing out coals to the town.\"\r\n\r\n~Welsh Cross.~--One of the Old-time Market-houses at the corner of Bull\r\nStreet, the bottom portion of the edifice being used by country people\r\nas a butter market. The upper room was for meetings and occasionally\r\nused for the detention of prisoners who came (it has been said) through\r\nthe window on to a small platform for the pillory or cat-o'-nine-tails,\r\naccording to their sentence.\r\n\r\n~West Bromwich~, if we are to credit \"Britannia Depicto,\" published in\r\n1753, was originally West Bromicham, or West Birmingham.\r\n\r\n~Wheeley's Lane~, though one of the quietest thoroughfares in Edgbaston,\r\nwas formerly used as part of the coach-road to Bristol, those vehicles\r\npassing the Old Church and down Priory Road.\r\n\r\n~Windmill.~--The old windmill that used to be on Holloway Head is marked\r\non the 1752 map, and it has been generally understood that a similar\r\nstructure stood there for many generations, but this one was built about\r\n1745. The sails might have been seen in motion forty or forty-five years\r\nago, and probably corn was then ground there. After the departure of the\r\nmiller and his men it was used for a time as a sort of huge summer\r\nhouse, a camera obscura being placed at the top, from which panoramic\r\nviews of the neighbourhood could be taken. It was demolished but a few\r\nyears back.\r\n\r\n~Woman's Rights.~--A local branch of the Women's Suffrage Association\r\nwas formed here in 1868: a Women's Liberal Association was instituted in\r\nOctober, 1873; a branch of the National Union or Working Women was\r\norganised January 29th, 1875; and a Woman Ratepayers' Protection Society\r\nwas established in August, 1881. With ladies on the School Board, lady\r\nGuardians, lady doctors, a special Women's Property Protection Act, &c.,\r\n&c., it can hardly be said that our lady friends are much curtailed of\r\ntheir liberty. We know there are Ladies' Refreshment Rooms, Ladies'\r\nRestaurants, and Ladies' Associations for Useful Work and a good many\r\nother things, but we doubt if the dear creatures of to-day would ever\r\ndream of having such an institution as Ladies' Card Club, like that of\r\ntheir Edgbaston predecessors of a century back.\r\n\r\n~Women Guardians.~--The introduction of the female element in the choice\r\nof Guardians of the Poor has long been thought desirable, and an\r\nAssociation for promoting the election of ladies was formed in 1882.\r\nThere are now two women Guardians on the Birmingham Board, and one on\r\nthe King's Norton Board. Taking lesson of their political brothers, the\r\nmembers of the Association, experiencing some difficulty in finding\r\nladies with proper legal qualification to serve on the Board, \"purchased\r\na qualification,\" and then run their candidate in. The next step will\r\ndoubtless be to pay their members, and, as the last year's income of the\r\nAssociation amounted to £12 4s. 11d., there can be no difficulty there.\r\n\r\n~Yeomanry Cavalry.~--The last official report showed the Warwickshire\r\nregiment could muster 213 on parade; while the Staffordshire had 422.\r\n\r\n~Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A.~--See \"_Philanthropic Institutions_.\"\r\n\r\n~Zoological Association.~--Early in 1873 a provisional committee of\r\ngentlemen undertook the formation of a local society similar to that of\r\nthe Regent's Park, of London, proposing to raise a fund of £7,000\r\ntowards such an establishment, partly by donations and partly in shape\r\nof entrance fees to Fellowship (fixed at £5). It was believed that with\r\na fair number of annual 40s. subscriptions and gate money from the\r\npublic that such a society might be made successful; several handsome\r\ndonations were promised, and a lot of \"fellows\" put their names down as\r\ngood for the fivers, but when, a little time after, Edmunds' (_alias_\r\nWombwell's) agents were trying to find here a purchaser for their\r\nwell-known travelling collections, the piecrust proverb was again proved\r\nto be correct.\r\n\r\n~Zoological Gardens.~--Morris Roberts, the ex-prizefighter, opened a\r\nmenagerie in the grounds of the Sherbourne Hotel, and called it The\r\nZoological Gardens, May 4, 1873. The animals were sold in April, 1876,\r\nthe place not being sufficiently attractive.\r\n\r\n~Obituary.~\r\n\r\nThe following short list of local people of interest may not be an\r\nunacceptable addition to the many whose names appear in various parts of\r\nthe preceding work:--\r\n\r\nAITKEN, W.C., the working man's friend, died March 24, 1875, aged 58.\r\n\r\nALBITES, ACHILLE, a respected teacher of French, died June 8, 1872, aged\r\n63.\r\n\r\nARIS, THOMAS, founder of the _Gazette_, died July 4, 1761.\r\n\r\nAYLESFORD, LORD, died Jan. 13, 1885, at Big Springs, Texas, aged 35.\r\n\r\nBANKS, MORRIS, chemist and druggist, died June 21, 1880, aged 75.\r\n\r\nBANKS, William, long connected with the local Press, died March 1, 1870,\r\naged 50.\r\n\r\nBATES, WILLIAM, a literary connoisseur of much talent, died September\r\n24, 1884.\r\n\r\nBOULTON, ANN, only daughter of Matthew Boulton, died October 13, 1829.\r\n\r\nBROWN, Rev.
