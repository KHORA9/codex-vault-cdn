Its preparation\r\noccupied about two years, while the author was busily engaged in other\r\nduties,--much of it being written while he was traveling or exploring\r\nin different parts of the Archipelago. No pretensions are made to an\r\nexhaustive character for the book. For the writer, as well as for the\r\npupil for whom it is intended, it is an introduction into the study\r\nof the history of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nConsiderable difficulty has been experienced in securing the necessary\r\nhistorical sources, but it is believed that the principal ones have\r\nbeen read. The author is greatly indebted to the Honorable Dr. Pardo\r\nde Tavera for the use of rare volumes from his library, and he wishes\r\nto acknowledge also the kindness of Mr. Manuel Yriarte, Chief of the\r\nBureau of Archives, for permission to examine public documents. The\r\noccasional reprints of the old Philippine histories have, however,\r\nbeen used more frequently than the original editions. The splendid\r\nseries of reprinted works on the Philippines, promised by Miss Blair\r\nand Mr. Robertson, was not begun in time to be used in the preparation\r\nof this book. The appearance of this series will make easy a path\r\nwhich the present writer has found comparatively difficult, and will\r\nopen the way for an incomparably better History of the Philippines\r\nthan has ever yet been made.\r\n\r\nThe drawings of ethnographic subjects, which partly illustrate this\r\nbook, were made from objects in the Philippine Museum by Mr. Anselmo\r\nEspiritu, a teacher in the public schools of Manila. They are very\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\nAbove every one else, in writing this book, the author is under\r\nobligations to his wife, without whose constant help and encouragement\r\nit could not have been written.\r\n\r\n\r\n    David P.

It is intended to introduce\r\nthem into the history of their own island country. The subject of\r\nPhilippine history is much broader and more splendid than the size\r\nand character of this little book reveal. Many subjects have only\r\nbeen briefly touched upon, and there are many sources of information,\r\nold histories, letters and official documents, which the writer had\r\nnot time and opportunity to study in the preparation of this work. It\r\nis not too soon, however, to present a history of the Philippines,\r\neven though imperfectly written, to the Philippine people themselves;\r\nand if this book serves to direct young men and young women to a study\r\nof the history of their own island country, it will have fulfilled\r\nits purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Development of the Philippines and of Japan.--In many ways the\r\nnext decade of the history of the Philippine Islands may resemble\r\nthe splendid development of the neighboring country of Japan. Both\r\ncountries have in past times been isolated more or less from the\r\nlife and thought of the modern world. Both are now open to the full\r\ncurrent of human affairs. Both countries promise to play an important\r\npart in the politics and commerce of the Far East. Geographically,\r\nthe Philippines occupy the more central and influential position,\r\nand the success of the institutions of the Philippines may react upon\r\nthe countries of southeastern Asia and Malaysia, to an extent that\r\nwe cannot appreciate or foresee, Japan, by reason of her larger\r\npopulation, the greater industry of her people, a more orderly\r\nsocial life, and devoted public spirit, is at the present time far\r\nin the lead.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines.--But the Philippines possess certain advantages which,\r\nin the course of some years, may tell strongly in her favor. There are\r\ngreater natural resources, a richer soil, and more tillable ground. The\r\npopulation, while not large, is increasing rapidly, more rapidly, in\r\nfact, than the population of Japan or of Java. And in the character of\r\nher institutions the Philippines have certain advantages. The position\r\nof woman, while so unfortunate in Japan, as in China and nearly all\r\neastern countries, in the Philippines is most fortunate, and is certain\r\nto tell effectually upon the advancement of the race in competition\r\nwith other eastern civilizations. The fact that Christianity is the\r\nestablished religion of the people makes possible a sympathy and\r\nunderstanding between the Philippines and western countries.\r\n\r\nJapan.--Yet there are many lessons which Japan can teach the\r\nPhilippines, and one of these is of the advantages and rewards\r\nof fearless and thorough study. Fifty years ago, Japan, which had\r\nrigorously excluded all intercourse with foreign nations, was forced to\r\nopen its doors by an American fleet under Commodore Perry. At that time\r\nthe Japanese knew nothing of western history, and had no knowledge of\r\nmodern science. Their contact with the Americans and other foreigners\r\nrevealed to them the inferiority of their knowledge. The leaders of\r\nthe country awoke to the necessity of a study of western countries\r\nand their great progress, especially in government and in the sciences.\r\n\r\nJapan had at her service a special class of people known as the\r\nsamurai, who, in the life of Old Japan, were the free soldiers of\r\nthe feudal nobility, and who were not only the fighters of Japan,\r\nbut the students and scholars as well. The young men of this samurai\r\nclass threw themselves earnestly and devotedly into the study of the\r\ngreat fields of knowledge, which had previously been unknown to the\r\nJapanese. At great sacrifice many of them went abroad to other lands,\r\nin order to study in foreign universities. Numbers of them went to\r\nthe United States, frequently working as servants in college towns\r\nin order to procure the means for the pursuit of their education.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government in every way began to adopt measures for\r\nthe transformation of the knowledge of the people. Schools were\r\nopened, laboratories established, and great numbers of scientific\r\nand historical books were translated into Japanese. A public school\r\nsystem was organized, and finally a university was established. The\r\nGovernment sent abroad many young men to study in almost every\r\nbranch of knowledge and to return to the service of the people. The\r\nmanufacturers of Japan studied and adopted western machinery and modern\r\nmethods of production. The government itself underwent revolution\r\nand reorganization upon lines more liberal to the people and more\r\nfavorable to the national spirit of the country. The result has been\r\nthe transformation, in less than fifty years, of what was formerly\r\nan isolated and ignorant country.\r\n\r\nThe Lesson for the Filipinos.--This is the great lesson which Japan\r\nteaches the Philippines. If there is to be transformation here, with\r\na constant growth of knowledge and advancement, and an elevation of\r\nthe character of the people as a whole, there must be a courageous\r\nand unfaltering search for the truth: and the young men and young\r\nwomen of the Philippines must seek the advantages of education, not\r\nfor themselves, but for the benefit of their people and their land;\r\nnot to gain for themselves a selfish position of social and economic\r\nadvantage over the poor and less educated Filipinos, but in order\r\nthat, having gained these advantages for themselves, they may in turn\r\ngive them to their less fortunate countrymen. The young Filipino,\r\nman or woman, must learn the lessons of truthfulness, courage, and\r\nunselfishness, and in all of his gaining of knowledge, and in his\r\nuse of it as well, he must practice these virtues, or his learning\r\nwill be an evil to his land and not a blessing.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this book is to help him to understand, first of all, the\r\nplace that the Philippines occupy in the modern history of nations, so\r\nthat he may understand how far and from what beginnings the Filipino\r\npeople have progressed, toward what things the world outside has\r\nitself moved during this time, and what place and opportunities the\r\nFilipinos, as a people, may seek for in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Meaning of History.--History, as it is written and understood,\r\ncomprises many centuries of human life and achievement, and we must\r\nbegin our study by discussing a little what history means. Men may\r\nlive for thousands of years without having a life that may be called\r\nhistorical; for history is formed only where there are credible\r\nwritten records of events. Until we have these records, we have no\r\nground for historical study, but leave the field to another study,\r\nwhich we call Archeology, or Prehistoric Culture.\r\n\r\nHistorical Races.--Thus there are great races which have no history,\r\nfor they have left no records. Either the people could not write,\r\nor their writings have been destroyed, or they told nothing about\r\nthe life of the people. The history of these races began only with\r\nthe coming of a historical, or more advanced race among them.\r\n\r\nThus, the history of the black, or negro, race begins only with\r\nthe exploration of Africa by the white race, and the history of the\r\nAmerican Indians, except perhaps of those of Peru and Mexico, begins\r\nonly with the white man's conquest of America. The white, or European,\r\nrace is, above all others, the great historical race; but the yellow\r\nrace, represented by the Chinese, has also a historical life and\r\ndevelopment, beginning many centuries before the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe European Race.--For thousands of years the white race was confined\r\nto the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It had but little\r\ncontact with other races of men and almost no knowledge of countries\r\nbeyond the Mediterranean shores. The great continents of America and\r\nAustralia and the beautiful island-world of the Pacific and Indian\r\noceans were scarcely dreamed of. This was the status of the white race\r\nin Europe a little more than five hundred years ago. How different\r\nis the position of this race to-day! It has now explored nearly the\r\nentire globe. The white people have crossed every continent and every\r\nsea. On every continent they have established colonies and over many\r\ncountries their power.\r\n\r\nDuring these last five centuries, besides this spread of geographical\r\ndiscoveries, the mingling of all the races, and the founding of great\r\ncolonies, has come also the development of scientific knowledge--great\r\ndiscoveries and inventions, such as the utilization of steam and\r\nelectricity, which give to man such tremendous power over the material\r\nworld. Very important changes have also marked the religious and\r\npolitical life of the race. Within these years came the Protestant\r\nrevolt from the Roman Catholic Church, destroying in some degree the\r\nunity of Christendom; and the great revolutions of Europe and America,\r\nestablishing democratic and representative governments.\r\n\r\nThe European Race and the Filipino People.--This expansion and progress\r\nof the European race early brought it into contact with the Filipino\r\npeople, and the historical life of the Philippines dates from this\r\nmeeting of the two races. Thus the history of the Philippines has\r\nbecome a part of the history of nations. During these centuries the\r\npeople of these islands, subjects of a European nation, have progressed\r\nin social life and government, in education and industries, in numbers,\r\nand in wealth. They have often been stirred by wars and revolutions,\r\nby centuries of piratical invasion, and fear of conquest by foreign\r\nnations. But these dangers have now passed away.\r\n\r\nThere is no longer fear of piratical ravage nor of foreign invasion,\r\nnor is there longer great danger of internal revolt; for the\r\nPhilippines are at the present time under a government strong enough\r\nto defend them against other powers, to put down plunder and ravage,\r\nand one anxious and disposed to afford to the people such freedom\r\nof opportunity, such advantages of government and life, that the\r\nincentive to internal revolution will no longer exist. Secure from\r\nexternal attack and rapidly progressing toward internal peace, the\r\nPhilippines occupy a position most fortunate among the peoples of the\r\nFar East. They have representative government, freedom of religion,\r\nand public education, and, what is more than all else to the aspiring\r\nor ambitious race or individual, freedom of opportunity.\r\n\r\nHow History is Written.--One other thing should be explained\r\nhere. Every child who reads this book should understand a little how\r\nhistory is written. A most natural inquiry to be made regarding any\r\nhistorical statement is, \"How is this known?\" And this is as proper a\r\nquestion for the school boy as for the statesman. The answer is, that\r\nhistory rests for its facts largely upon the written records made by\r\npeople who either lived at the time these things took place, or so\r\nnear to them that, by careful inquiry, they could learn accurately\r\nof these matters and write them down in some form, so that we to-day\r\ncan read their accounts, and at least know how these events appeared\r\nto men of the time.\r\n\r\nBut not all that a man writes, or even puts in a book, of things\r\nhe has seen and known, is infallibly accurate and free from error,\r\npartiality, and untruthfulness. So the task of the historian is not\r\nmerely to read and accept all the contemporary records, but he must\r\nalso compare one account with another, weighing all that he can find,\r\nmaking due allowance for prejudice, and on his own part trying to\r\nreach a conclusion that shall be true. Of course, where records are\r\nfew the task is difficult indeed, and, on the other hand, material\r\nmay be so voluminous as to occupy a writer a lifetime, and make it\r\nimpossible for any one man completely to exhaust a subject.\r\n\r\nHistorical Accounts of the Philippines.--For the Philippines we\r\nare so fortunate as to have many adequate sources of a reliable and\r\nattractive kind. In a few words some of these will be described. Nearly\r\nall exist in at least a few libraries in the Philippines, where they\r\nmay sometime be consulted by the Filipino student, and many of them,\r\nat least in later editions, may be purchased by the student for his\r\nown possession and study.\r\n\r\nThe Voyages of Discovery.--European discovery of the Philippines began\r\nwith the great voyage of Magellan; and recounting this discovery of\r\nthe islands, there is the priceless narrative of one of Magellan's\r\ncompany, Antonio Pigafetta. His book was written in Italian, but was\r\nfirst published in a French translation. The original copies made\r\nby Pigafetta have disappeared, but in 1800 a copy was discovered in\r\nthe Ambrosian Library of Milan, Italy, and published. Translations\r\ninto English and other languages exist. It may be found in several\r\ncollections of Voyages, and there is a good Spanish translation and\r\nedition of recent date. (El Primer Viaje alrededor del Mundo, por\r\nAntonio Pigafetta, traducido por Dr. Carlos Amoretti y anotado por\r\nManuel Walls y Merino, Madrid, 1899.) There are several other accounts\r\nof Magellan's voyage; but Pigafetta's was the only one written by\r\nan eye-witness, and his descriptions of the Bisaya Islands, Cebu,\r\nBorneo, and the Moluccas are wonderfully interesting and accurate.\r\n\r\nThere were several voyages of discovery between Magellan's time (1521)\r\nand Legaspi's time (1565). These include the expeditions of Loaisa,\r\nSaavedra, and Villalobos, and accounts of them are to be found in\r\nthe great series of publications made by the Spanish Government and\r\ncalled Coleccion de documentos ineditos, and, in another series,\r\nNavarrete's Coleccion de los viajes y descubrimientos.\r\n\r\nSpanish Occupation and Conquest.--As we come to the history of Spanish\r\noccupation and conquest of the Philippines, we find many interesting\r\nletters and reports sent by both soldiers and priests to the king, or\r\nto persons in Spain. The first complete book on the Philippines was\r\nwritten by a missionary about 1602, Father Predo Chirino's Relacion\r\nde las Islas Filipinas, printed in Rome in 1604. This important and\r\ncurious narrative is exceedingly rare, but a reprint, although rude\r\nand poor, was made in Manila in 1890, which is readily obtainable. The\r\nRelacion de las Islas Filipinas was followed in 1609 by the work of\r\nJudge Antonio de Morga, Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas. This very\r\nrare work was printed in Mexico. In 1890 a new edition was brought\r\nout by Dr. Jose Rizal, from the copy in the British Museum. There is\r\nalso an English translation.\r\n\r\nThese two works abound in curious and valuable information upon\r\nthe Filipino people as they were at the time of the arrival of the\r\nSpaniards, as does also a later work, the Conquista de las Islas\r\nFilipinas, by Friar Gaspar de San Augustin, printed in Madrid in\r\n1698. This latter is perhaps the most interesting and most important\r\nearly work on the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see, the history of the Philippines is closely connected\r\nwith that of the East Indian Spice Islands. When the Spanish forces\r\ntook the rich island of Ternate in 1606, the triumph was commemorated\r\nby a volume, finely written, though not free from mistakes, the\r\nConquista de las Islas Moluccas, by Leonardo de Argensola, Madrid,\r\n1609. There is an old English translation, and also French and Dutch\r\ntranslations.\r\n\r\nTo no other religious order do we owe so much historical information as\r\nto the Jesuits. The scholarship and literary ability of the Company\r\nhave always been high. Chirino was a Jesuit, as was also Father\r\nFrancisco Colin, who wrote the Labor Evangelica, a narrative of\r\nthe Jesuit missions in the Philippines, China, and Japan, which was\r\nprinted in Madrid in 1663. This history was continued years later by\r\nFather Murillo Velarde, who wrote what he called the Segunda Parte,\r\nthe Historia de la Provincia de Filipinas de la Compania de Jesus,\r\nManila, 1749.\r\n\r\nThere is another notable Jesuit work to which we owe much of the\r\nearly history of the great island of Mindanao: this is the Historia de\r\nMindanao y Jolo, by Father Francisco Combes. The year 1663 marked, as\r\nwe shall see, an epoch in the relations between the Spaniards and the\r\nMohammedan Malays. In that year the Spaniards abandoned the fortress\r\nof Zamboanga, and retired from southern Mindanao. The Jesuits had\r\nbeen the missionaries in those parts of the southern archipelago,\r\nand they made vigorous protests against the abandonment of Moro\r\nterritory. One result of their efforts to secure the reoccupancy\r\nof these fortresses was the notable work mentioned above. It is the\r\noldest and most important writing about the island and the inhabitants\r\nof Mindanao. It was printed in Madrid in 1667. A beautiful and exact\r\nedition was brought out a few years ago, by Retana.\r\n\r\nA Dominican missionary, Father Diego Aduarte, wrote a very important\r\nwork, the Historia de la Provincia del Sancto Rosario de la Orden de\r\nPredicadores en Filipinas, Japon y China, which was printed in Manila\r\nat the College of Santo Tomas in 1640.\r\n\r\nWe may also mention as containing a most interesting account of\r\nthe Philippines about the middle of the seventeenth century, the\r\nfamous work on China, by the Dominican, Father Fernandez Navarrete,\r\nTratados historicos, politicos, ethnicos, y religiosos de la Monarchia\r\nde China, Madrid, 1767. Navarrete arrived in these islands in 1648,\r\nand was for a time a cura on the island of Mindoro. Later he was a\r\nmissionary in China, and then Professor of Divinity in the University\r\nof Santo Tomas. His work is translated into English in Churchill's\r\nCollection of Voyages and Travels, London, 1744, second volume.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century is rather barren of interesting historical\r\nmatter. There was considerable activity in the production of grammars\r\nand dictionaries of the native languages, and more histories of the\r\nreligious orders were also produced. These latter, while frequently\r\nfilled with sectarian matter, should not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1788 and 1792 was published the voluminous Historia\r\nGeneral de Filipinas, in fourteen volumes, by the Recollect friar,\r\nFather Juan de la Concepcion. The work abounds in superfluous matter\r\nand trivial details, yet it is a copious source of information,\r\na veritable mine of historical data, and is perhaps the best known\r\nand most frequently used work upon the Philippine Islands. There\r\nare a number of sets in the Philippines which can be consulted by\r\nthe student.\r\n\r\nSome years after, and as a sort of protest against so extensive\r\na treatment of history, the sane and admirable Augustinian, Father\r\nJoaquin Martinez de Zuniga, wrote his Historia de las Islas Filipinas,\r\na volume of about seven hundred pages. It was printed in Sampaloc,\r\nManila, in 1803. This writer is exceptional for his fairmindedness,\r\nhis freedom from the narrow prejudices which have characterized\r\nmost of the writers on the Philippines. His language is terse and\r\nspirited, and his volume is the most readable and, in many ways, the\r\nmost valuable attempt at a history of the Philippines. His narrative\r\ncloses with the English occupation of Manila in 1763.\r\n\r\nRecent Histories and Other Historical Materials.--The sources for\r\nthe conditions and history of the islands during the last century\r\ndiffer somewhat from the preceding. The documentary sources in the\r\nform of public papers and reports are available, and there is a\r\nconsiderable mass of pamphlets dealing with special questions in\r\nthe Philippines. The publication of the official journal of the\r\nGovernment, the Gazeta de Manila, commenced in 1861. It contains\r\nall acts of legislation, orders of the Governors, pastoral letters,\r\nand other official matters, down to the end of Spanish rule.\r\n\r\nA vast amount of material, for the recent civil history of the\r\nislands exists in the Archives of the Philippines, at Manila, but\r\nthese documents have been very little examined. Notable among these\r\noriginal documents is the series of Royal Cedulas, each bearing the\r\nsignature of the King of Spain, \"Yo, el Rey.\" They run back from the\r\nlast years of sovereignty to the commencement of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. The early cedulas, on the establishment of Spanish rule,\r\nare said to have been carried away by the British army in 1763,\r\nand to be now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nOf the archives of the Royal Audiencia at Manila, the series of\r\njudgments begins with one of 1603, which is signed by Antonia\r\nde Morga. From this date they appear to be complete. The earliest\r\nrecords of the cases which came before this court that can be found,\r\ndate from the beginning of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nOf modern historical writings mention must be made of the Historia\r\nde Filipinas, three volumes, 1887, by Montero y Vidal, and the\r\npublications of W. E. Retana. To the scholarship and enthusiasm of\r\nthis last author much is owed. His work has been the republication\r\nof rare and important sources. His edition of Combes has already\r\nbeen mentioned, and there should also be mentioned, and if possible\r\nprocured, his Archivo del Bibliofilo, four volumes, a collection of\r\nrare papers on the islands, of different dates; and his edition, the\r\nfirst ever published, of Zuniga's Estadismo de las Islas Filipinas,\r\nan incomparable survey of the islands made about 1800, by the priest\r\nand historian whose history was mentioned above.\r\n\r\nAccounts of Voyagers Who Visited the Philippines.--These references\r\ngive some idea of the historical literature of the Philippines. They\r\ncomprise those works which should be chiefly consulted. There should\r\nnot be omitted the numerous accounts of voyagers who have visited\r\nthese islands from time to time, and who frequently give us very\r\nvaluable information. The first of these are perhaps the English and\r\nDutch freebooters, who prowled about these waters to waylay the richly\r\nladen galleons. One of these was Dampier, who, about 1690, visited\r\nthe Ladrones and the Philippines. His New Voyage Around the World was\r\npublished in 1697. There was also Anson, who in 1743 took the Spanish\r\ngalleon off the coast of Samar, and whose voyage is described in a\r\nvolume published in 1745. There was an Italian physician, Carreri,\r\nwho visited the islands in 1697, in the course of a voyage around the\r\nworld, and who wrote an excellent description of the Philippines, which\r\nis printed in English translation in Churchill's Collection of Voyages.\r\n\r\nA French expedition visited the East between 1774 and 1781, and the\r\nCommissioner, M. Sonnerat, has left a brief account of the Spanish\r\nsettlements in the islands as they then appeared. (Voyage aux Indes\r\nOrientales et a la Chine, Paris, 1782, Vol. 3.)\r\n\r\nThere are a number of travellers' accounts written in the last century,\r\nof which may be mentioned Sir John Bowring's Visit to the Philippine\r\nIslands, 1859, and Jagor's Reisen in der Philippinen, travels in the\r\nyear 1859 and 1860, which has received translation into both English\r\nand Spanish.\r\n\r\nBibliographies.--For the historical student a bibliographical guide\r\nis necessary. Such a volume was brought out in 1898, by Retana,\r\nCatalogo abreviado de la Biblioteca Filipina. It contains a catalogue\r\nof five thousand seven hundred and eighty works, published in or upon\r\nthe Philippines. A still more exact and useful bibliography has been\r\nprepared by the Honorable T. H. Pardo de Tavera, Biblioteca Filipina,\r\nand is published by the United States Government.\r\n\r\nIt is lamentable that the Philippines Government possesses no library\r\nof works on the Archipelago. The foundation of such an institution\r\nseems to have been quite neglected by the Spanish Government, and works\r\non the Philippines are scarcely to be found, except as they exist in\r\nprivate collections. The largest of these is said to be that of the\r\nCompania General de Tabacos, at Barcelona, which has also recently\r\npossessed itself of the splendid library of Retana. In Manila the\r\nHonorable Dr. Pardo de Tavera possesses the only notable library in\r\nthe islands.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written the Philippines Government has commenced\r\nthe collection of historic works in the Philippines, and a talented\r\nyoung Filipino scholar, Mr. Zulueta, has gone to Spain for extensive\r\nsearch, both of archives and libraries, in order to enrich the public\r\ncollection in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe publication of a very extensive series of sources of Philippine\r\nhistory has also been begun by the Arthur H. Clark Company in\r\nthe United States, under the editorship of Miss E. H. Blair and\r\nMr. J. A. Robertson. The series will embrace fifty-five volumes, and\r\nwill contain in English translations all available historical material\r\non the Philippines, from the age of discovery to the nineteenth\r\ncentury. This notable collection will place within the reach of the\r\nstudent all the important sources of his country's history, and will\r\nmake possible a more extensive and accurate writing of the history\r\nof the islands than has ever before been possible.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the published works, there repose numerous unstudied\r\ndocuments of Philippine history in the Archives of the Indies at\r\nSeville.\r\n\r\nHistorical Work for the Filipino Student.--After reading this book,\r\nor a similar introductory history, the student should procure, one\r\nby one, as many as he can of the volumes which have been briefly\r\ndescribed above, and, by careful reading and patient thought, try\r\nto round out the story of his country and learn the lessons of the\r\nhistory of his people. He will find it a study that will stimulate\r\nhis thought and strengthen his judgment; but always he must search\r\nfor the truth, even though the truth is sometimes humiliating and\r\nsad. If there are regrettable passages in our own lives, we cannot\r\nfind either happiness or improvement in trying to deny to ourselves\r\nthat we have done wrong, and so conceal and minimize our error. So if\r\nthere are dark places in the history of our land and people, we must\r\nnot obscure the truth in the mistaken belief that we are defending\r\nour people's honor, for, by trying to conceal the fact and excuse\r\nthe fault, we only add to the shame. It is by frank acknowledgment\r\nand clear depiction of previous errors that the country's honor will\r\nbe protected now and in the future.\r\n\r\nVery interesting and important historical work can be done by the\r\nFilipino student in his own town or province. The public and parish\r\nrecords have in many towns suffered neglect or destruction. In\r\nall possible cases these documents should be gathered up and cared\r\nfor. For many things, they are worthy of study. They can show the\r\ngrowth of population, the dates of erection of the public buildings,\r\nthe former system of government, and social conditions.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in which the patriotism of every young man and\r\nwoman can find an expression. Many sites throughout the islands are\r\nnotable for the historic occurrences which they witnessed. These\r\nshould be suitably marked with tablets or monuments, and the exact\r\nfacts of the events that took place should be carefully collected,\r\nand put in writing. Towns and provinces should form public libraries\r\ncontaining, among other works, books on the Philippines; and it\r\nshould be a matter of pride to the young Filipino scholar to build\r\nup such local institutions, and to educate his townsmen in their use\r\nand appreciation.\r\n\r\nBut throughout such studies the student should remember that his town\r\nor locality is of less importance, from a patriotic standpoint, than\r\nhis country as a whole; that the interests of one section should never\r\nbe placed above those of the Archipelago; and that, while his first and\r\nforemost duty is to his town and to his people, among whom he was born\r\nand nurtured, he owes a greater obligation to his whole country and\r\npeople, embracing many different islands and different tongues, and to\r\nthe great Government which holds and protects the Philippine Islands,\r\nand which is making possible the free development of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLES OF THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Study of Ethnology.--The study of races and peoples forms a\r\nseparate science from history, and is known as ethnology, or the\r\nscience of races. Ethnology informs us how and where the different\r\nraces of mankind originated. It explains the relationships between\r\nthe races as well as the differences of mind, of body, and of mode\r\nof living which different people exhibit.\r\n\r\nAll such knowledge is of great assistance to the statesman as he\r\ndeals with the affairs of his own people and of other peoples,\r\nand it helps private individuals of different races to understand\r\none another and to treat each other with due respect, kindness, and\r\nsympathy. Inasmuch, too, as the modern history which we are studying\r\ndeals with many different peoples of different origin and race, and\r\nas much of our history turns upon these differences, we must look\r\nfor a little at the ethnology of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe Negritos.--Physical Characteristics.--The great majority of the\r\nnatives of our islands belong to what is usually called the Malayan\r\nrace, or the Oceanic Mongols. There is, however, one interesting\r\nlittle race scattered over the Philippines, which certainly has no\r\nrelationship at all with Malayans. These little people are called by\r\nthe Tagalog, \"Aeta\" or \"Ita.\" The Spaniards, when they arrived, called\r\nthem \"Negritos,\" or \"little negroes,\" the name by which they are best\r\nknown. Since they were without question the first inhabitants of these\r\nislands of whom we have any knowledge, we shall speak of them at once.\r\n\r\nThey are among the very smallest peoples in the world, the average\r\nheight of the men being about 145 centimeters, or the height of\r\nan American boy of twelve years; the women are correspondingly\r\nsmaller. They have such dark-brown skins that many people suppose\r\nthem to be quite black; their hair is very wooly or kinky, and forms\r\nthick mats upon their heads. In spite of these peculiarities, they\r\nare not unattractive in appearance. Their eyes are large and of a\r\nfine brown color, their features are quite regular, and their little\r\nbodies often beautifully shaped.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of these little savages excited the attention of the\r\nfirst Spaniards, and there are many early accounts of them. Padre\r\nChirino, who went as a missionary in 1592 to Panay, begins the\r\nnarrative of his labors in that island as follows: \"Among the Bisayas,\r\nthere are also some Negroes. They are less black and ugly than those\r\nof Guinea, and they are much smaller and weaker, but their hair and\r\nbeard are just the same. They are much more barbarous and wild than\r\nthe Bisayas and other Filipinos, for they have neither houses nor\r\nany fixed sites for dwelling. They neither plant nor reap, but live\r\nlike wild beasts, wandering with their wives and children through\r\nthe mountains, almost naked. They hunt the deer and wild boar,\r\nand when they kill one they stop right there until all the flesh is\r\nconsumed. Of property they have nothing except the bow and arrow.\" [1]\r\n\r\nManners and Customs.--The Negritos still have this wild, timid\r\ncharacter, and few have ever been truly civilized in spite of the\r\nefforts of some of the Spanish missionaries. They still roam through\r\nthe mountains, seldom building houses, but making simply a little\r\nwall and roof of brush to keep off the wind and rain. They kill deer,\r\nwild pigs, monkeys, and birds, and in hunting they are very expert;\r\nbut their principal food is wild roots and tubers, which they roast\r\nin ashes. Frequently in traveling through the mountains, although one\r\nmay see nothing of these timid little folk, he will see many large,\r\nfreshly dug holes from each of which they have taken out a root.\r\n\r\nThe Negritos ornament their bodies by making little rows of cuts on the\r\nbreast, back, and arms, and leaving the scars in ornamental patterns;\r\nand some of them also file their front teeth to points. In their hair\r\nthey wear bamboo combs with long plumes of hair or of the feathers\r\nof the mountain cock. They have curious dances, and ceremonies for\r\nmarriage and for death.\r\n\r\nDistribution.--The Negritos have retired from many places where they\r\nlived when the Spaniards first arrived, but there are still several\r\nthousand in Luzon, especially in the Cordillera Zambales, on the\r\nPacific coast, and in the Sierra Madre range; and in the interior of\r\nPanay, Negros, Tablas, and in Surigao of Mindanao.\r\n\r\nRelation of the Negritos to Other Dwarfs of the World.--Although the\r\nNegritos have had very little effect on the history of the Philippines,\r\nthey are of much interest as a race to scientists, and we can not\r\nhelp asking, Whence came these curious little people, and what does\r\ntheir presence here signify? While science can not at present fully\r\nanswer these questions, what we do actually know about these pygmies\r\nis full of interest.\r\n\r\nThe Aetas of the Philippines are not the only black dwarfs in the\r\nworld. A similar little people, who must belong to the same race,\r\nlive in the mountains and jungles of the Malay peninsula. On the\r\nAndaman Islands in the Indian Ocean, all the aboriginal inhabitants\r\nare similar pygmies, called \"Mincopies.\" Some traces of their former\r\nexistence are reported from many other places in the East Indies.\r\n\r\nThus it may be that there was a time when these little men and women\r\nhad much of this island-world quite to themselves, and their race\r\nstretched unbrokenly from the Philippines across Malacca to the Indian\r\nOcean. As it would have been impossible for so feeble a people to force\r\ntheir way from one island to another after the arrival of the stronger\r\nraces, who have now confined them to the mountainous interiors, we\r\nare obliged to believe that the Negritos were on the ground first,\r\nand that at one time they were more numerous. The Indian archipelago\r\nwas then a world of black pygmies. It may be that they were even more\r\nextensive than this, for one of the most curious discoveries of modern\r\ntimes has been the finding of similar little blacks in the equatorial\r\nforests of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Negritos must not be confused with the black or negro race of\r\nNew Guinea or Melanesia, who are commonly called Papuans; for those\r\nNegroes are of tall stature and belong with the true Negroes of\r\nAfrica, though how the Negro race thus came to be formed of two so\r\nwidely separated branches we do not know.\r\n\r\nThe Malayan Race.--Origin of the Race.--It is thought that the Malayan\r\nrace originated in southeastern Asia. From the mainland it spread\r\ndown into the peninsula and so scattered southward and eastward over\r\nthe rich neighboring islands. Probably these early Malayans found\r\nthe little Negritos in possession and slowly drove them backward,\r\ndestroying them from many islands until they no longer exist except\r\nin the places we have already named.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of this migratory movement which carried them from\r\none island to another of the great East Indian Archipelago, these\r\nearly Malayans must have invented the boats and praos for which they\r\nare famed, and have become skillful sailors living much upon the sea.\r\n\r\nEffect of the Migration.--Life for many generations, upon these\r\nislands, so warm, tropical, and fruitful, gradually modified these\r\nemigrants from Asia, until they became in mind and body quite a\r\ndifferent race from the Mongol inhabitants of the mainland.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics.--The Malayan peoples are of a light-brown color,\r\nwith a light yellowish undertone on some parts of the skin, with\r\nstraight black hair, dark-brown eyes, and, though they are a small\r\nrace in stature, they are finely formed, muscular, and active. The\r\nphysical type is nearly the same throughout all Malaysia, but the\r\ndifferent peoples making up the race differ markedly from one another\r\nin culture. They are divided also by differences in religion. There\r\nare many tribes which are pagan. On Bali and Lombok, little islands\r\nsouth of Java, the people are still Brahmin, like most inhabitants\r\nof India. In other parts of Malaysia they are Mohammedans, while in\r\nthe Philippines alone they are mostly Christians.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Malayan Tribes.--Considering first the pagan or the wild\r\nMalayan peoples, we find that in the interior of the Malay Peninsula\r\nand of many of the islands, such as Sumatra, Borneo and the Celebes,\r\nthere are wild Malayan tribes, who have come very little in contact\r\nwith the successive civilizing changes that have passed over this\r\narchipelago. The true Malays call these folk \"Orang benua,\" or\r\n\"men of the country,\" Many are almost savages, some are cannibals,\r\nand others are headhunters like some of the Dyaks of Borneo.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, too, we find what is probably this same class of\r\nwild people living in the mountains. They are warlike, savage, and\r\nresist approach. Sometimes they eat human flesh as a ceremonial act,\r\nand some prize above all other trophies the heads of their enemies,\r\nwhich they cut from the body and preserve in their homes. It is\r\nprobable that these tribes represent the earliest and rudest epoch\r\nof Malayan culture, and that these were the first of this race to\r\narrive in the Philippines and dispute with the Negritos for the\r\nmastery of the soil. In such wild state of life, some of them, like\r\nthe Manguianes of Mindoro, have continued to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe Tribes in Northern Luzon.--In northern Luzon, in the great\r\nCordillera Central, there are many of these primitive tribes. These\r\npeople are preeminently mountaineers. They prefer the high, cold,\r\nand semi-arid crests and valleys of the loftiest ranges. Here,\r\nwith great industry, they have made gardens by the building of\r\nstone-walled terraces on the slopes of the hills. Sometimes hundreds\r\nof these terraces can be counted in one valley, and they rise one\r\nabove the other from the bottom of a canyon for several miles almost\r\nto the summit of a ridge. These terraced gardens are all under\r\nmost careful irrigation. Water is carried for many miles by log\r\nflumes and ditches, to be distributed over these little fields. The\r\nsoil is carefully fertilized with the refuse of the villages. Two\r\nand frequently three crops are produced each year. Here we find\r\nundoubtedly the most developed and most nearly scientific agriculture\r\nin the Philippines. They raise rice, cotton, tobacco, the taro,\r\nmaize, and especially the camote, or sweet potato, which is their\r\nprincipal food. These people live in compact, well-built villages,\r\nfrequently of several hundred houses. Some of these tribes, like\r\nthe Igorrotes of Benguet and the Tinguianes of Abra, are peaceable\r\nas well as industrious. In Benguet there are fine herds of cattle,\r\nmuch excellent coffee, and from time immemorial the Igorrotes here\r\nhave mined gold.\r\n\r\nBesides these peaceful tribes there are in Bontoc, and in the northern\r\nparts of the Cordillera, many large tribes, with splendid mountain\r\nvillages, who are nevertheless in a constant and dreadful state of\r\nwar. Nearly every town is in feud with its neighbors, and the practice\r\nof taking heads leads to frequent murder and combat. A most curious\r\ntribe of persistent head hunters are the Ibilao, or Ilongotes, who live\r\nin the Caraballo Sur Mountains between Nueva Ecija and Nueva Vizcaya.\r\n\r\nOn other islands of the Philippines there are similar wild tribes. On\r\nthe island of Paragua there are the Tagbanua and other savage folk.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of the Tribes of Mindanao.--In Mindanao, there are many\r\nmore tribes. Three of these tribes, the Aetas, Mandaya, and Manobo,\r\nare on the eastern coast and around Mount Apo. In Western Mindanao,\r\nthere is quite a large but scattered tribe called the Subanon. These\r\npeople make clearings on the hillsides and support themselves by\r\nraising maize and mountain rice. They also raise hemp, and from the\r\nfiber they weave truly beautiful blankets and garments, artistically\r\ndyed in very curious patterns. These peoples are nearly all pagans,\r\nthough a few are being gradually converted to Mohammedanism, and some\r\nto Christianity. The pagans occasionally practice the revolting rites\r\nof human sacrifice and ceremonial cannibalism.\r\n\r\nThe Civilized Malayan Peoples.--Their Later Arrival.--At a later\r\ndate than the arrival of these primitive Malayan tribes, there came\r\nto the Philippines others of a more developed culture and a higher\r\norder of intelligence. These peoples rapidly mastered the low country\r\nand the coasts of all the islands, driving into the interior the\r\nearlier comers and the aboriginal Negritos. These later arrivals,\r\nthough all of one stock, differed considerably, and spoke different\r\ndialects belonging to one language family. They were the ancestors\r\nof the present civilized Filipino people.\r\n\r\nDistribution of These Peoples.--All through the central islands,\r\nPanay, Negros, Leyte, Samar, Marinduque, and northern Mindanao, are\r\nthe Bisaya, the largest of these peoples. At the southern extremity\r\nof Luzon, in the provinces of Sorsogon and the Camarines, are the\r\nBicol. North of these, holding central Luzon, Batangas, Cavite,\r\nManila, Laguna, Bataan, Bulacan, and Nueva Ecija, are the Tagalog,\r\nwhile the great plain of northern Luzon is occupied by the Pampango\r\nand Pangasinan. All the northwest coast is inhabited by the Ilocano,\r\nand the valley of the Cagayan by a people commonly called Cagayanes,\r\nbut whose dialect is Ibanag. In Nueva Vizcaya province, on the Batanes\r\nIslands and the Calamianes, there are other distinct branches of\r\nthe Filipino people, but they are much smaller in numbers and less\r\nimportant than the tribes marked above.\r\n\r\nImportance of These Peoples.--They form politically and historically\r\nthe Filipino people. They are the Filipinos whom the Spaniards ruled\r\nfor more than three hundred years. All are converts to Christianity,\r\nand all have attained a somewhat similar stage of civilization.\r\n\r\nEarly Contact of the Malays and Hindus.--These people at the time\r\nof their arrival in the Philippines were probably not only of a\r\nhigher plane of intelligence than any who had preceded them in the\r\noccupation of the islands, but they appear to have had the advantages\r\nof contact with a highly developed culture that had appeared in the\r\neastern archipelago some centuries earlier.\r\n\r\nEarly Civilization in India.--More than two thousand years ago,\r\nIndia produced a remarkable civilization. There were great cities of\r\nstone, magnificent palaces, a life of splendid luxury, and a highly\r\norganized social and political system. Writing, known as the Sanskrit,\r\nhad been developed, and a great literature of poetry and philosophy\r\nproduced. Two great religions, Brahminism and Buddhism, arose, the\r\nlatter still the dominant religion of Tibet, China, and Japan. The\r\npeople who produced this civilization are known as the Hindus. Fourteen\r\nor fifteen hundred years ago Hinduism spread over Burma, Siam, and\r\nJava. Great cities were erected with splendid temples and huge idols,\r\nthe ruins of which still remain, though their magnificence has gone\r\nand they are covered to-day with the growth of the jungle.\r\n\r\nInfluence of Hindu Culture on the Malayan Peoples.--This powerful\r\ncivilization of the Hindus, established thus in Malaysia, greatly\r\naffected the Malayan people on these islands, as well as those who\r\ncame to the Philippines. Many words in the Tagalog have been shown to\r\nhave a Sanskrit origin, and the systems of writing which the Spaniards\r\nfound in use among several of the Filipino peoples had certainly been\r\ndeveloped from the alphabet then in use among these Hindu peoples\r\nof Java.\r\n\r\nThe Rise of Mohammedanism.--Mohammed.--A few hundred years later\r\nanother great change, due to religious faith, came over the Malayan\r\nrace,--a change which has had a great effect upon the history of\r\nthe Philippines, and is still destined to modify events far into the\r\nfuture. This was the conversion to Mohammedanism. Of all the great\r\nreligions of the world, Mohammedanism was the last to arise, and\r\nits career has in some ways been the most remarkable. Mohammed, its\r\nfounder, was an Arab, born about 572 A.D. At that time Christianity\r\nwas established entirely around the Mediterranean and throughout\r\nmost of Europe, but Arabia was idolatrous. Mohammed was one of those\r\ngreat, prophetic souls which arise from time to time in the world's\r\nhistory. All he could learn from Hebrewism and Christianity, together\r\nwith the result of his own thought and prayers, led him to the belief\r\nin one God, the Almighty, the Compassionate, the Merciful, who as he\r\nbelieved would win all men to His knowledge through the teachings of\r\nMohammed himself. Thus inspired, Mohammed became a teacher or prophet,\r\nand by the end of his life he had won his people to his faith and\r\ninaugurated one of the greatest eras of conquest the world has seen.\r\n\r\nSpread of Mohammedanism to Africa and Europe.--The armies of Arabian\r\nhorsemen, full of fanatical enthusiasm to convert the world to their\r\nfaith, in a century's time wrested from Christendom all Judea, Syria,\r\nand Asia Minor, the sacred land where Jesus lived and taught, and the\r\ncountries where Paul and the other apostles had first established\r\nChristianity. Thence they swept along the north coast of Africa,\r\nbringing to an end all that survived of Roman power and religion,\r\nand by 720 they had crossed into Europe and were in possession of\r\nSpain. For nearly the eight hundred years that followed, the Christian\r\nSpaniards fought to drive Mohammedanism from the peninsula, before\r\nthey were successful.\r\n\r\nThe Conversion of the Malayans to Mohammedanism.--Not only did\r\nMohammedanism move westward over Africa and Europe, it was carried\r\neastward as well. Animated by their faith, the Arabs became the\r\ngreatest sailors, explorers, merchants, and geographers of the\r\nage. They sailed from the Red Sea down the coast of Africa as far as\r\nMadagascar, and eastward to India, where they had settlements on both\r\nthe Malabar and Coromandel coasts. Thence Arab missionaries brought\r\ntheir faith to Malaysia.\r\n\r\nAt that time the true Malays, the tribe from which the common term\r\n\"Malayan\" has been derived, were a small people of Sumatra. At least\r\nas early as 1250 they were converted to Mohammedanism, brought to\r\nthem by these Arabian missionaries, and under the impulse of this\r\nmighty faith they broke from their obscurity and commenced that\r\ngreat conquest and expansion that has diffused their power, language,\r\nand religion throughout the East Indies.\r\n\r\nMohammedan Settlement in Borneo.--A powerful Mohammedan Malay\r\nsettlement was established on the western coasts of Borneo certainly\r\nas early as 1400. The more primitive inhabitants, like the Dyaks,\r\nwho were a tribe of the primitive Malayans, were defeated, and the\r\npossession of the coast largely taken from them. From this coast of\r\nBorneo came many of the adventurers who were traversing the seas of\r\nthe Philippines when the Spaniards arrived.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedan Population of Mindanao and Jolo owes something\r\ncertainly to this same Malay migration which founded the colony\r\nof Borneo. But the Maguindanao and Illano Moros seem to be largely\r\ndescendants of primitive tribes, such as the Manobo and Tiruray, who\r\nwere converted to Mohammedanism by Malay and Arab proselyters. The\r\ntraditions of the Maguindanao Moros ascribe their conversion to\r\nKabunsuan, a native of Johore, the son of an Arab father and Malay\r\nmother. He came to Maguindanao with a band of followers, and from him\r\nthe datos of Maguindanao trace their lineage. Kabunsuan is supposed\r\nto be descended from Mohammed through his Arab father, Ali, and so\r\nthe datos of Maguindanao to the present day proudly believe that in\r\ntheir veins flows the blood of the Prophet.\r\n\r\nThe Coming of the Spaniards.--Mohammedanism was still increasing in\r\nthe Philippines when the Spaniards arrived. The Mohammedans already\r\nhad a foothold on Manila Bay, and their gradual conquest of the\r\narchipelago was interrupted only by the coming of the Europeans. It\r\nis a strange historical occurrence that the Spaniards, having fought\r\nwith the Mohammedans for nearly eight centuries for the possession of\r\nSpain, should have come westward around the globe to the Philippine\r\nIslands and there resumed the ancient conflict with them. Thus the\r\nSpaniards were the most determined opponents of Mohammedanism on both\r\nits western and eastern frontiers. Their ancient foes who crossed\r\ninto Spain from Morocco had been always known as \"Moros\" or \"Moors,\"\r\nand quite naturally they gave to these new Mohammedan enemies the\r\nsame title, and Moros they are called to the present day.\r\n\r\nSummary.--Such, then, are the elements which form the population of\r\nthese islands,--a few thousands of the little Negritos; many wild\r\nmountain tribes of the primitive Malayans; a later immigration of\r\nMalayans of higher cultivation and possibilities than any that preceded\r\nthem, who had been influenced by the Hinduism of Java and who have\r\nhad in recent centuries an astonishing growth both in numbers and in\r\nculture; and last, the fierce Mohammedan sea-rovers, the true Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEUROPE AND THE FAR EAST ABOUT 1400 A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mediaeval Period in Europe.--Length of the Middle Age.--By the\r\nMiddle Ages we mean the centuries between 500 and 1300 A.D. This\r\nperiod begins with the fall of the Roman Empire and the looting of\r\nthe Imperial City by the rude German tribes, and ends with the rise\r\nof a new literature, a new way of looking at the world in general,\r\nand a passion for discovery of every kind.\r\n\r\nThese eight hundred years had been centuries of cruel struggle,\r\nintellectual darkness, and social depression, but also of great\r\nreligious devotion. Edward Gibbon, one of the greatest historians,\r\nspeaks of this period as \"the triumph of barbarism and religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe population of Europe was largely changed, during the first few\r\ncenturies of the Christian Era, as the Roman Empire, that greatest\r\npolitical institution of all history, slowly decayed. New peoples\r\nof German or Teutonic origin came, fighting their way into western\r\nEurope and settling wherever the land attracted them. Thus Spain and\r\nItaly received the Goths; France, the Burgundians and Franks; England,\r\nthe Saxons and Angles or English.\r\n\r\nThese peoples were all fierce, warlike, free, unlettered\r\nbarbarians. Fortunately, they were all converted to Christianity by\r\nRoman priests and missionaries. They embraced this faith with ardor,\r\nat the same time that other peoples and lands were being lost to\r\nChristendom. Thus it has resulted that the countries where Christianity\r\narose and first established itself, are now no longer Christian, and\r\nthis religion, which had an Asiatic and Semitic origin, has become the\r\ndistinguishing faith of the people of western Europe. For centuries the\r\ncountries of Europe were fiercely raided and disturbed by pillaging\r\nand murdering hordes; by the Huns, who followed in the Germans from\r\nthe East; by the Northmen, cruel pirating seamen from Scandinavia;\r\nand, as we have already seen, by the Mohammedans, or Saracens as they\r\nwere called, who came into central Europe by way of Spain.\r\n\r\nCharacter of the Life during this Period.--Feudalism.--Life was so\r\nbeset with peril that independence or freedom became impossible,\r\nand there was developed a society which has lasted almost down to\r\nthe present time, and which we call Feudalism. The free but weak man\r\ngave up his freedom and his lands to some stronger man, who became\r\nhis lord. He swore obedience to this lord, while the lord engaged to\r\nfurnish him protection and gave him back his lands to hold as a \"fief,\"\r\nboth sharing in the product. This lord swore allegiance to some still\r\nmore powerful man, or \"overlord,\" and became his \"vassal,\" pledged\r\nto follow him to war with a certain number of armed men; and this\r\noverlord, on his part, owed allegiance to the prince, who was, perhaps,\r\na duke or bishop (bishops at this time were also feudal lords),\r\nor to the king or emperor. Thus were men united into large groups\r\nor nations for help or protection. There was little understanding\r\nof love of country. Patriotism, as we feel it, was replaced by the\r\npassion of fidelity or allegiance to one's feudal superior.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages of Feudalism.--The great curse of this system was that\r\nthe feudal lords possessed the power to make war upon one another,\r\nand so continuous were their jealousies and quarrelings that the land\r\nwas never free from armed bands, who laid waste an opponent's country,\r\nkilling the miserable serfs who tilled the soil, and destroying their\r\nhomes and cattle.\r\n\r\nThere was little joy in life and no popular learning. If a man did not\r\nenjoy warfare, but one other life was open to him, and that was in the\r\nChurch. War and religion were the pursuits of life, and it is no wonder\r\nthat many of the noblest and best turned their backs upon a life that\r\npromised only fighting and bloodshed and, renouncing the world, became\r\nmonks. Monasticism developed in Europe under such conditions as these,\r\nand so strong were the religious feelings of the age that at one time\r\na third of the land of France was owned by the religious orders.\r\n\r\nThe Town.--The two typical institutions of the early Middle Age were\r\nthe feudal castle, with its high stone walls and gloomy towers,\r\nwith its fierce bands of warriors armed in mail and fighting on\r\nhorseback with lance and sword, and the monastery, which represented\r\ninn, hospital, and school. Gradually, however, a third structure\r\nappeared. This was the town. And it is to these mediaeval cities, with\r\ntheir busy trading life, their free citizenship, and their useful\r\noccupations, that the modern world owes much of its liberty and its\r\nintellectual light.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance.--Changes in Political Affairs.--By 1400, however,\r\nthe Middle Age had nearly passed and a new life had appeared, a new\r\nepoch was in progress, which is called the Renaissance, which means\r\n\"rebirth.\" In political affairs the spirit of nationality had arisen,\r\nand feudalism was already declining. Men began to feel attachment to\r\ncountry, to king, and to fellow-citizens; and the national states,\r\nas we now know them, each with its naturally bounded territory,\r\nits common language, and its approximately common race, were appearing.\r\n\r\nFrance and England were, of these states, the two most advanced\r\npolitically just previous to the fifteenth century. At this distant\r\ntime they were still engaged in a struggle which lasted quite a\r\ncentury and is known as the Hundred Years' War. In the end, England\r\nwas forced to give up all her claims to territory on the continent,\r\nand the power of France was correspondingly increased. In France\r\nthe monarchy (king and court) was becoming the supreme power in the\r\nland. The feudal nobles lost what power they had, while the common\r\npeople gained nothing. In England, however, the foundations for a\r\nrepresentative government had been laid. The powers of legislation and\r\ngovernment were divided between the English king and a Parliament. The\r\nParliament was first called in 1265 and consisted of two parts,--the\r\nLords, representing the nobility; and the Commons, composed of persons\r\nchosen by the common people.\r\n\r\nGermany was divided into a number of small principalities,--Saxony,\r\nBavaria, Franconia, Bohemia, Austria, the Rhine principalities, and\r\nmany others,--which united in a great assembly, or Diet, the head of\r\nwhich was some prince, chosen to be emperor.\r\n\r\nItaly was also divided. In the north, in the valley of the Po,\r\nor Lombardy, were the duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice;\r\nsouth, on the western coast, were the Tuscan states, including the\r\nsplendid city of Florence. Thence, stretching north and south across\r\nthe peninsula, were states of the church, whose ruler was the pope,\r\nfor until less than fifty years ago the pope was not only the head\r\nof the church but also a temporal ruler. Embracing the southern part\r\nof the peninsula was the principality of Naples.\r\n\r\nIn the Spanish peninsula Christian states had arisen,--in the west,\r\nPortugal, in the center and east, Castile, Aragon, and Leon, from all\r\nof which the Mohammedans had been expelled. But they still held the\r\nsouthern parts of Spain, including the beautiful plain of Andalusia\r\nand Grenada.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedans, in the centuries of their life in Spain, had\r\ndeveloped an elegant and prosperous civilization. By means of\r\nirrigation and skillful planting, they had converted southern Spain\r\ninto a garden. They were the most skillful agriculturists and breeders\r\nof horses and sheep in Europe, and they carried to perfection many\r\nfine arts, while knowledge and learning were nowhere further advanced\r\nthan here. Through contact with this remarkable people the Christian\r\nSpaniards gained much. Unfortunately, however, the spirit of religious\r\nintolerance was so strong, and the hatred engendered by the centuries\r\nof religious war was so violent, that in the end the Spaniard became\r\nimbued with so fierce a fanaticism that he has ever since appeared\r\nunable properly to appreciate or justly to treat any who differed\r\nfrom him in religious belief.\r\n\r\nThe Conquests of the Mohammedans.--In the fifteenth century,\r\nreligious toleration was but little known in the world, and the\r\npeople of the great Mohammedan faith still threatened to overwhelm\r\nChristian Europe. Since the first great conquests of Islam in the\r\neighth century had been repulsed from central Europe, that faith had\r\nshown a wonderful power of winning its way. In the tenth century Asia\r\nMinor was invaded by hordes of Seljuks, or Turks, who poured down from\r\ncentral Asia in conquering bands. These tribes had overthrown the\r\nArab's power in Mesopotamia and Asia Minor only to become converts\r\nto his faith. With freshened zeal they hurled themselves upon the\r\nold Christian empire, which at Constantinople had survived the fall\r\nof the rest of the Roman world.\r\n\r\nThe Crusades.--The Seljuk Turks had conquered most of Asia Minor,\r\nSyria, and the Holy Land. A great fear came over the people of Europe\r\nthat the city of Constantinople would be captured and they, too, be\r\noverwhelmed by these new Mohammedan enemies. The passionate religious\r\nzeal of the Middle Age also roused the princes and knights of Europe\r\nto try to wrest from the infidel the Holy Land of Palestine, where\r\nwere the birthplace of Christianity and the site of the Sepulcher of\r\nChrist. Palestine was recovered and Christian states were established\r\nthere, which lasted for over a hundred and eighty years. Then the Arab\r\npower revived and, operating from Egypt, finally retook Jerusalem and\r\nexpelled the Christian from the Holy Land, to which he has never yet\r\nreturned as a conqueror.\r\n\r\nEffects of the Crusades.--These long, holy wars, or \"Crusades,\" had a\r\nprofound effect upon Europe. The rude Christian warrior from the west\r\nwas astonished and delighted with the splendid and luxurious life which\r\nhe met at Constantinople and the Arabian East. Even though he was a\r\nprince, his life at home was barren of comforts and beauty. Glass,\r\nlinen, rugs, tapestries, silk, cotton, spices, and sugar were some\r\nof the things which the Franks and the Englishmen took home with\r\nthem from the Holy Land. Demand for these treasures of the East\r\nbecame irresistible, and trade between western Europe and the East\r\ngrew rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Cities of Italy.--The cities of Italy developed this\r\ncommerce. They placed fleets upon the Mediterranean. They carried the\r\ncrusaders out and brought back the wares that Europe desired. In this\r\nway these cities grew and became very wealthy. On the west coast,\r\nwhere this trade began, were Amalfi, Pisa, Genoa, and Florence, and\r\non the east, at the head of the Adriatic, was Venice. The rivalry\r\nbetween these cities of Italy was very fierce. They fought and\r\nplundered one another, each striving to win a monopoly for itself of\r\nthis invaluable trade.\r\n\r\nVenice, finally, was victorious. Her location was very favorable. From\r\nher docks the wares could be carried easily and by the shortest\r\nroutes up the Po River and thence into France or northward over the\r\nAlps to the Danube. In Bavaria grew up in this trade the splendid\r\nGerman cities of Augsburg and Nuremberg, which passed these goods on\r\nto the cities of the Rhine, and so down this most beautiful river\r\nto the coast. Here the towns of Flanders and of the Low Countries,\r\nor Holland, received them and passed them on again to England and\r\neastward to the countries of the Baltic.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of Modern Language.--Thus commerce and trade grew up\r\nin Europe, and, with trade and city life, greater intelligence,\r\nlearning, and independence. Education became more common, and the\r\nuniversities of Europe were thronged. Latin in the Middle Age had\r\nbeen the only language that was written by the learned class. Now\r\nthe modern languages of Europe took their form and began to be used\r\nfor literary purposes. Italian was the first to be so used by the\r\ngreat Dante, and in the same half-century the English poet Chaucer\r\nsang in the homely English tongue, and soon in France, Germany, and\r\nSpain national literatures appeared. With this went greater freedom\r\nof expression. Authority began to have less weight.\r\n\r\nMen began to inquire into causes and effects, to doubt certain things,\r\nto seek themselves for the truth, and so the Renaissance came. With\r\nit came a greater love for the beautiful, a greater joy in life, a\r\nfresh zest for the good of this world, a new passion for discovery,\r\na thirst for adventure, and, it must also be confessed a new laxity of\r\nliving and a new greed for gold. Christian Europe was about to burst\r\nits narrow bounds. It could not be repressed nor confined to its old\r\nlimitations. It could never turn backward. Of all the great changes\r\nwhich have come over life and thought, probably none are greater than\r\nthose which saw the transition from the mediaeval to the modern world.\r\n\r\nTrade with the East.--Articles of Trade.--Now we must go back for\r\na moment and pursue an old inquiry further. Whence came all these\r\nbeautiful and inviting wares that had produced new tastes and passions\r\nin Europe? The Italian traders drew them from the Levant, but the\r\nLevant had not produced them. Neither pepper, spices, sugarcane, costly\r\ngems, nor rich silks, were produced on the shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nOnly the rich tropical countries of the East were capable of growing\r\nthese rare plants, and up to that time of delivering to the delver\r\nmany precious stones. India, the rich Malaysian archipelago, the\r\nkingdom of China,--these are the lands and islands which from time\r\nimmemorial have given up their treasures to be forwarded far and wide\r\nto amaze and delight the native of colder and less productive lands.\r\n\r\nRoutes of Trade to the Far East.--Three old sailing and caravan routes\r\nconnect the Mediterranean with the Far East. They are so old that we\r\ncan not guess when men first used them. They were old in the days of\r\nSolomon and indeed very ancient when Alexander the Great conquered the\r\nEast. One of these routes passed through the Black Sea, and across\r\nthe Caspian Sea to Turkestan to those strange and romantic ancient\r\ncities, Bokhara and Samarkand. Thence it ran northeasterly across Asia,\r\nentering China from the north. Another crossed Syria and went down\r\nthrough Mesopotamia to the Indian Ocean, A third began in Egypt and\r\nwent through the Red Sea, passing along the coast of Arabia to India.\r\n\r\nAll of these had been in use for centuries, but by the year 1400 two\r\nhad been closed. A fresh immigration of Turks, the Ottomans, in the\r\nfourteenth century came down upon the scourged country of the Euphrates\r\nand Syria, and although these Turks also embraced Mohammedanism,\r\ntheir hostility closed the first two routes and commerce over them\r\nhas never since been resumed.\r\n\r\nVenetian Monopoly of Trade.--Thus all interest centered upon the\r\nsouthern route. By treaty with the sultan or ruler of Egypt, Venice\r\nsecured a monopoly of the products which came over this route. Goods\r\nfrom the East now came in fleets up the Red Sea, went through the\r\nhands of the sultan of Egypt, who collected a duty for them, and\r\nthen were passed on to the ships of the wealthy Venetian merchant\r\nprinces, who carried them throughout Europe. Although the object of\r\nintense jealousy, it seemed impossible to wrest this monopoly from\r\nVenice. Her fleet was the strongest on the Mediterranean, and her\r\nrule extended along the Adriatic to the Grecian islands. All eager\r\nminds were bent upon the trade with the East, but no way was known,\r\nsave that which now Venice had gained.\r\n\r\nExtent of Geographical Knowledge.--The Maps of this Period.--To\r\nrealize how the problem looked to the sailor of Genoa or the merchant\r\nof Flanders at that time, we must understand how scanty and erroneous\r\nwas the geographical knowledge of even the fifteenth century. It\r\nwas believed that Jerusalem was the center of the world, a belief\r\nfounded upon a biblical passage. The maps of this and earlier dates\r\nrepresent the earth in this way: In the center, Palestine, and beneath\r\nit the Mediterranean Sea, the only body of water which was well known;\r\non the left side is Europe; on the right, Africa; and at the top,\r\nAsia--the last two continents very indefinitely mapped. Around the\r\nwhole was supposed to flow an ocean, beyond the first few miles of\r\nwhich it was perilous to proceed lest the ship be carried over the\r\nedge of the earth or encounter other perils.\r\n\r\nIdeas about the Earth.--The Greek philosophers before the time of\r\nChrist had discovered that the world is a globe, or ball, and had\r\neven computed rudely its circumference. But in the Middle Ages this\r\nknowledge had been disputed and contradicted by a geographer named\r\nCosmas, who held that the world was a vast plane, twice as long as\r\nit was broad and surrounded by an ocean. This belief was generally\r\nadopted by churchmen, who were the only scholars of the Middle Ages,\r\nand came to be the universal belief of Christian Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance revived the knowledge of the writings of the old Greek\r\ngeographers who had demonstrated the earth's shape to be round and had\r\nroughly calculated its size; but these writings did not have sufficient\r\ncirculation in Europe to gain much acceptance among the Christian\r\ncosmographers. The Arabs, however, after conquering Egypt, Syria and\r\nnorthern Africa, translated into their own tongue the wisdom of the\r\nGreeks and became the best informed and most scientific geographers\r\nof the Middle Age, so that intercourse with the Arabs which began with\r\nthe Crusades helped to acquaint Europe somewhat with India and China.\r\n\r\nThe Far East.--The Tartar Mongols.--Then in the thirteenth century\r\nall northern Asia and China fell under the power of the Tartar\r\nMongols. Russia was overrun by them and western Europe threatened. At\r\nthe Danube, however, this tide of Asiatic conquest stopped, and then a\r\nlong period when Europe came into diplomatic and commercial relations\r\nwith these Mongols and through them learned something of China.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo Visits the Great Kaan.--Several Europeans visited the\r\ncourt of the Great Kaan, or Mongol king, and of one of them, Marco\r\nPolo, we must speak in particular. He was a Venetian, and when a\r\nyoung man started in 1271 with his father and uncle on a visit to\r\nthe Great Kaan. They passed from Italy to Syria, across to Bagdad,\r\nand so up to Turkestan, where they saw the wonderful cities of this\r\nstrange oasis, thence across the Pamirs and the Desert of Gobi to\r\nLake Baikal, where the Kaan had his court. Here in the service of\r\nthis prince Marco Polo spent over seventeen years. So valuable indeed\r\nwere his services that the Kaan would not permit him to return. Year\r\nafter year he remained in the East. He traversed most of China, and\r\nwas for a time \"taotai,\" or magistrate, of the city of Yang Chan near\r\nthe Yangtze River. He saw the amazing wonders of the East. He heard of\r\n\"Zipangu,\" or Japan. He probably heard of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nFinally the opportunity came for the three Venetians to return. The\r\nGreat Kaan had a relative who was a ruler of Persia, and ambassadors\r\ncame from this ruler to secure a Mongol princess for him to marry. The\r\ndangers and hardships of the travel overland were considered too\r\ndifficult for the delicate princess, and it was decided to send her\r\nby water. Marco Polo and his father and uncle were commissioned to\r\naccompany the expedition to Persia.\r\n\r\nHistory of Marco Polo's Travels.--They sailed from the port of Chin\r\nCheu, probably near Amoy, [2] in the year 1292. They skirted the\r\ncoasts of Cambodia and Siam and reached the eastern coasts of Sumatra,\r\nwhere they waited five months for the changing of the monsoon. Of\r\nthe Malay people of Sumatra, as well as of these islands, their\r\nanimals and productions, Marco Polo has left us most interesting and\r\nquite accurate accounts. The Malays on Sumatra were beginning to be\r\nconverted to Mohammedanism, for Marco Polo says that many of them were\r\n\"Saracens.\" He gained a good knowledge of the rich and mysterious\r\nIndian Isles, where the spices and flavorings grew. It was two years\r\nbefore the party, having crossed the Indian Ocean, reached Persia\r\nand the court of the Persian king. When they arrived they found that\r\nwhile they were making this long voyage the Persian king had died;\r\nbut they married the Mongol princess to his son, the young prince,\r\nwho had succeeded him, and that did just as well.\r\n\r\nFrom Persia the Venetians crossed to Syria and thence sailed to\r\nItaly, and at last reached home after an absence of twenty-six\r\nyears. But Marco Polo's adventures did not end with his return to\r\nVenice. In a fierce sea fight between the Venetians and Genoese,\r\nhe was made a prisoner and confined in Genoa. Here a fellow captive\r\nwrote down from Marco's own words the story of his eastern adventures,\r\nand this book we have to-day. It is a record of adventure, travel,\r\nand description, so wonderful that for years it was doubted and\r\nits accuracy disbelieved. But since, in our own time, men have been\r\nable to traverse again the routes over which Marco Polo passed, fact\r\nafter fact has been established, quite as he truthfully stated them\r\ncenturies ago. To have been the first European to make this mighty\r\ncircuit of travel is certainly a strong title to enduring fame.\r\n\r\nCountries of the Far East.--India.--Let us now briefly look at the\r\ncountries of the Far East, which by the year 1400 had come to exercise\r\nover the mind of the European so irresistible a fascination. First\r\nof all, India, as we have seen, had for centuries been the principal\r\nsource of the western commerce. But long before the date we are\r\nconsidering, the scepter of India had fallen from the hand of the\r\nHindu. From the seventh century, India was a prey to Mohammedan\r\nconquerors, who entered from the northwest into the valley of the\r\nIndus. At first these were Saracens or Arabs; later they were the\r\nsame Mongol converts to Mohammedanism, whose attacks upon Europe we\r\nhave already noticed.\r\n\r\nIn 1398 came the furious and bloody warrior, the greatest of all\r\nMongols,--Timour, or Tamerlane. He founded, with capital at Delhi,\r\nthe empire of the Great Mogul, whose rule over India was only broken\r\nby the white man. Eastward across the Ganges and in the Dekkan,\r\nor southern part of India, were states ruled over by Indian princes.\r\n\r\nChina.--We have seen how, at the time of Marco Polo, China also was\r\nruled by the Tartar Mongols. The Chinese have ever been subject to\r\nattack from the wandering horse-riding tribes of Siberia. Two hundred\r\nyears before Christ one of the Chinese kings built the Great Wall that\r\nstretches across the northern frontier for one thousand three hundred\r\nmiles, for a defense against northern foes. Through much of her history\r\nthe Chinese have been ruled by aliens, as they are to-day. About 1368,\r\nhowever, the Chinese overthrew the Mongol rulers and established the\r\nMing dynasty, the last Chinese house of emperors, who ruled China until\r\n1644, when the Manchus, the present rulers, conquered the country.\r\n\r\nChina was great and prosperous under the Mings. Commerce flourished\r\nand the fleets of Chinese junks sailed to India, the Malay Islands,\r\nand to the Philippines for trade. The Grand Canal, which connects\r\nPeking with the Yangtze River basin and Hangchau, was completed. It\r\nwas an age of fine productions of literature.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese seem to have been much less exclusive then than they\r\nare at the present time; much less a peculiar, isolated people than\r\nnow. They did not then shave their heads nor wear a queue. These\r\ncustoms, as well as that hostility to foreign intercourse which they\r\nhave to-day, has been forced upon China by the Manchus. China appeared\r\nat that time ready to assume a position of enormous influence among\r\nthe peoples of the earth,--a position for which she was well fitted\r\nby the great industry of all classes and the high intellectual power\r\nof her learned men.\r\n\r\nJapan.--Compared with China or India, or even some minor states,\r\nthe development of Japan at this time was very backward. Her people\r\nwere divided and there was constant civil war. The Japanese borrowed\r\ntheir civilization from the Chinese. From them they learned writing\r\nand literature, and the Buddhist religion, which was introduced\r\nabout 550 A.D. But in temperament they are a very different people,\r\nbeing spirited, warlike, and, until recent years, despising trading\r\nand commerce.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of her history, Japan has been an empire. The\r\nruler, the Mikado, is believed to be of heavenly descent; but in the\r\ncenturies we are discussing the government was controlled by powerful\r\nnobles, known as the Shogun, who kept the emperors in retirement in\r\nthe palaces of Kyoto, and themselves directed the State. The greatest\r\nof these shoguns was Iyeyasu, who ruled Japan about 1600, soon after\r\nManila was founded. They developed in Japan a species of feudalism,\r\nthe great lords, or \"daimios,\" owning allegiance to the shoguns, and\r\nabout the daimios, as feudal retainers, bodies of samurai, who formed\r\na partly noble class of their own. The samurai carried arms, fought\r\nat their lords' command, were students and literati, and among them\r\ndeveloped that proud, loyal, and elevated code of morality known as\r\n\"Bushido,\" which has done so much for the Japanese people. It is this\r\nsamurai class who in modern times have effected the immense revolution\r\nin the condition and power of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Malay Archipelago.--If now we look at the Malay Islands, we find,\r\nas we have already seen, that changes had been effected there. Hinduism\r\nhad first elevated and civilized at least a portion of the race, and\r\nMohammedanism and the daring seamanship of the Malay had united these\r\nislands under a common language and religion. There was, however,\r\nno political union. The Malay peninsula was divided. Java formed a\r\ncentral Malay power. Eastward among the beautiful Celebes and Moluccas,\r\nthe true Spice Islands, were a multitude of small native rulers, rajas\r\nor datos, who surrounded themselves with retainers, kept rude courts,\r\nand gathered wealthy tributes of cinnamon, pepper, and cloves. The\r\nsultans of Ternate, Tidor, and Amboina were especially powerful,\r\nand the islands they ruled the most rich and productive.\r\n\r\nBetween all these islands there was a busy commerce. The Malay is\r\nan intrepid sailor, and an eager trader. Fleets of praos, laden with\r\ngoods, passed with the changing monsoons from part to part, risking the\r\nperils of piracy, which have always troubled this archipelago. Borneo,\r\nwhile the largest of all these islands, was the least developed, and\r\ndown to the present day has been hardly explored. The Philippines\r\nwere also outside of most of this busy intercourse and had at that\r\ndate few products to offer for trade. Their only connection with the\r\nrest of the Malay race was through the Mohammedan Malays of Jolo\r\nand Borneo. The fame of the Spice Islands had long filled Europe,\r\nbut the existence of the Philippines was unknown.\r\n\r\nSummary.--We have now reviewed the condition of Europe and of\r\nfarther Asia as they were before the period of modern discovery\r\nand colonization opened. The East had reached a condition of quiet\r\nstability. Mohammedanism, though still spreading, did not promise to\r\neffect great social changes. The institutions of the East had become\r\nfixed in custom and her peoples neither made changes nor desired\r\nthem. On the other hand western Europe had become aroused to an excess\r\nof ambition. New ideas, new discoveries and inventions were moving\r\nthe nations to activity and change. That era of modern discovery and\r\nprogress, of which we cannot yet perceive the end, had begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT GEOGRAPHICAL DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Eastern Passage to India.--The Portuguese.--We have seen in the\r\nlast chapter how Venice held a monopoly of the only trading-route\r\nwith the Far East. Some new way of reaching India must be sought,\r\nthat would permit the traders of other Christian powers to reach the\r\nmarts of the Orient without passing through Mohammedan lands. This\r\nsurpassing achievement was accomplished by the Portuguese. So low at\r\nthe present day has the power of Portugal fallen that few realize the\r\ndaring and courage once displayed by her seamen and soldiers and the\r\nenormous colonial empire that she established.\r\n\r\nPortugal freed her territory of the Mohammedan Moors nearly a century\r\nearlier than Spain; and the vigor and intelligence of a great king,\r\nJohn I., brought Portugal, about the year 1400, to an important place\r\namong the states of Europe. This king captured from the Moors the city\r\nof Ceuta, in Morocco; and this was the beginning of modern European\r\ncolonial possessions, and the first bit of land outside of Europe to\r\nbe held by a European power since the times of the Crusades. King\r\nJohn's youngest son was Prince Henry, famous in history under the\r\ntitle of \"the Navigator.\" This young prince, with something of the\r\nsame adventurous spirit that filled the Crusaders, was ardent to\r\nextend the power of his father's kingdom and to widen the sway of the\r\nreligion which he devotedly professed. The power of the Mohammedans in\r\nthe Mediterranean was too great for him hopefully to oppose and so he\r\nplanned the conquest of the west coast of Africa, and its conversion\r\nto Christianity. With these ends in view, he established at Point\r\nSagres, on the southwestern coast of Portugal, a naval academy and\r\nobservatory. Here he brought together skilled navigators, charts,\r\nand geographies, and all scientific knowledge that would assist in\r\nhis undertaking. [3]\r\n\r\nHe began to construct ships larger and better than any in use. To\r\nus they would doubtless seem very clumsy and small, but this was the\r\nbeginning of ocean ship-building. The compass and the astrolabe, or\r\nsextant, the little instrument with which, by calculating the height\r\nof the sun above the horizon, we can tell distance from the equator,\r\nwere just coming into use. These, as well as every other practicable\r\ndevice for navigation known at that time, were supplied to these ships.\r\n\r\nExploration of the African Coast.--Thus equipped and ably manned, the\r\nlittle fleets began the exploration of the African coast, cautiously\r\nfeeling their way southward and ever returning with reports of progress\r\nmade. Year after year this work went on. In 1419 the Madeira Islands\r\nwere rediscovered and colonized by Portuguese settlers. The growing of\r\nsugarcane was begun, and vines were brought from Burgundy and planted\r\nthere. The wine of the Madeiras has been famous to this day. Then\r\nwere discovered the Canaries and in 1444 the Azores. The southward\r\nexploration of the coast of the mainland steadily continued until\r\nin 1445 the Portuguese reached the mouth of the Senegal River. Up to\r\nthis point the African shore had not yielded much of interest to the\r\nPortuguese explorer or trader. Below Morocco the great Sahara Desert\r\nreaches to the sea and renders barren the coast for hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\nSouth of the mouth of the Senegal and comprising the whole Guinea\r\ncoast, Africa is tropical, well watered, and populous. This is the home\r\nof the true African Negro. Here, for almost the first time, since the\r\nbeginning of the Middle Ages, Christian Europe came in contact with\r\na race of ruder culture and different color than its own. This coast\r\nwas found to be worth exploiting; for it yielded, besides various\r\ndesirable resinous gums, three articles which have distinguished the\r\nexploitation of Africa, namely, gold, ivory, and slaves.\r\n\r\nBeginning of Negro Slavery in Europe.--At this point begins the\r\nhorrible and revolting story of European Negro slavery. The ancient\r\nworld had practiced this ownership of human chattels, and the Roman\r\nEmpire had declined under a burden of half the population sunk\r\nin bondage. To the enormous detriment and suffering of mankind,\r\nMohammed had tolerated the institution, and slavery is permitted\r\nby the Koran. But it is the glory of the mediaeval church that it\r\nabolished human slavery from Christian Europe. However dreary and\r\nunjust feudalism may have been, it knew nothing of that institution\r\nwhich degrades men and women to the level of cattle and remorselessly\r\nsells the husband from his family, the mother from her child.\r\n\r\nSlaves in Portugal.--The arrival of the Portuguese upon the coast of\r\nGuinea now revived not the bondage of one white man to another, but\r\nthat of the black to the white. The first slaves carried to Portugal\r\nwere regarded simply as objects of peculiar interest, captives to\r\nrepresent to the court the population of those shores which had been\r\nadded to the Portuguese dominion. But southern Portugal, from which\r\nthe Moors had been expelled, had suffered from a lack of laborers,\r\nand it was found profitable to introduce Negroes to work these fields.\r\n\r\nArguments to Justify Slavery.--So arose the institution of Negro\r\nslavery, which a century later upon the shores of the New World was\r\nto develop into so tremendous and terrible a thing. Curiously enough,\r\nreligion was evoked to justify this enslavement of the Africans. The\r\nChurch taught that these people, being heathen, were fortunate to\r\nbe captured by Christians, that they might thereby be brought to\r\nbaptism and conversion; for it is better for the body to perish than\r\nfor the soul to be cast into hell. At a later age, when the falsity\r\nof this teaching had been realized, men still sought to justify the\r\ninstitution by arguing that the Almighty had created the African of\r\na lower state especially that he might serve the superior race.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Guinea continued to be the resort of slavers down to the\r\nmiddle of the last century, and such scenes of cruelty, wickedness,\r\nand debauchery have occurred along its shores as can scarcely be\r\nparalleled in brutality in the history of any people.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese can hardly be said to have colonized the coast in the\r\nsense of raising up there a Portuguese population. As he approached\r\nthe equator the white man found that, in spite of his superior\r\nstrength, he could not permanently people the tropics. Diseases new\r\nto his experience attacked him. His energy declined. If he brought\r\nhis family with him, his children were few or feeble and shortly his\r\nrace had died out.\r\n\r\nThe settlements of the Portuguese were largely for the purposes of\r\ntrade. At Sierra Leone, Kamerun, or Loango, they built forts and\r\nestablished garrisons, mounting pieces of artillery that gave them\r\nadvantage over the attacks of the natives, and erecting warehouses\r\nand the loathsome \"barracoon,\" where the slaves were confined to\r\nawait shipment. Such decadent little settlements still linger along\r\nthe African coast, although the slave-trade happily has ended.\r\n\r\nThe Successful Voyage of Vasco da Gama.--Throughout the century Prince\r\nHenry's policy of exploration was continued. Slowly the middle coast\r\nof Africa became known. At last in 1486, Bartholomew Diaz rounded\r\nthe extremity of the continent. He named it the Cape of Storms; but\r\nthe Portuguese king, with more prophetic sight, renamed it the Cape\r\nof Good Hope. It was ten years, however, before the Portuguese could\r\nsend another expedition. Then Vasco da Gama rounded the cape again,\r\nfollowed up the eastern coast until the Arab trading-stations were\r\nreached. Then he struck across the sea, landed at the Malabar coast\r\nof India, and in 1498 arrived at Calcutta. The end dreamed of by\r\nall of Europe had been achieved. A sea-route to the Far East had\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\nResults of Da Gama's Voyage.--The importance of this performance\r\nwas instantly recognized in Europe. Venice was ruined. \"It was a\r\nterrible day,\" said a contemporary writer, \"when the word reached\r\nVenice. Bells were rung, men wept in the streets, and even the bravest\r\nwere silent.\" The Arabs and the native rulers made a desperate effort\r\nto expel the Portuguese from the Indian Ocean, but their opponents were\r\ntoo powerful. In the course of twenty years Portugal had founded an\r\nempire that had its forts and trading-marts from the coast of Arabia\r\nto Malaysia. Zanzibar, Aden, Oman, Goa, Calicut, and Madras were all\r\nPortuguese stations, fortified and secured. In the Malay peninsula was\r\nfounded the colony of Malacca. It retained its importance and power\r\nuntil in the last century, when it dwindled before the competition\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe work of building up this great domain was largely that of one man,\r\nthe intrepid Albuquerque. Think what his task was! He was thousands of\r\nmiles from home and supplies, he had only such forces and munitions as\r\nhe could bring with him in his little ships, and opposed to him were\r\nmillions of inhabitants and a multitude of Mohammedan princes. Yet this\r\ngreat captain built up an Indian empire. Portugal at one bound became\r\nthe greatest trading and colonizing power in the world. Her sources\r\nof wealth appeared fabulous, and, like Venice, she made every effort\r\nto secure her monopoly. The fleets of other nations were warned that\r\nthey could not make use of the Cape of Good Hope route, on penalty\r\nof being captured or destroyed.\r\n\r\nReaching India by Sailing West.--The Earth as a Sphere.--Meanwhile,\r\njust as Portugal was carrying to completion her project of reaching\r\nIndia by sailing east, Europe was electrified by the supposed\r\nsuccessful attempt of reaching India by sailing directly west,\r\nacross the Atlantic. This was the plan daringly attempted in 1492 by\r\nChristopher Columbus. Columbus was an Italian sailor and cosmographer\r\nof Genoa. The idea of sailing west to India did not originate with\r\nhim, but his is the immortal glory of having persistently sought the\r\nmeans and put the idea into execution.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese discoveries along the African coast gradually\r\nrevealed the extension of this continent and the presence of people\r\nbeyond the equator, and the possibility of passing safely through\r\nthe tropics. This knowledge was a great stimulus to the peoples\r\nof Europe. The geographical theory of the Greeks, that the world\r\nis round, was revived. The geographers, however, in making their\r\ncalculations of the earth's circumference, had fallen into an error\r\nof some thousands of miles; that is, instead of finding that it is\r\nfully twelve thousand miles from Europe around to the East Indies,\r\nthey had supposed it about four thousand, or even less. Marco Polo\r\ntoo had exaggerated the distance he had traveled and from his accounts\r\nmen had been led to believe that China, Japan, and the Spice Islands\r\nlie much further to the east than they actually do.\r\n\r\nBy sailing west across one wide ocean, with no intervening lands, it\r\nwas thought that one could arrive at the island-world off the continent\r\nof Asia. This was the theory that was revived in Italy and which clung\r\nin men's minds for years and years, even after America was discovered.\r\n\r\nAn Italian, named Toscanelli, drew a map showing how this voyage could\r\nbe made, and sent Columbus a copy. By sailing first to the Azores, a\r\nconsiderable portion of the journey would be passed, with a convenient\r\nresting-stage. Then about thirty-five days' favorable sailing would\r\nbring one to the islands of \"Cipango,\" or Japan, which Marco Polo\r\nhad said lay off the continent of Asia. From here the passage could\r\nreadily be pursued to Cathay and India.\r\n\r\nThe Voyage of Christopher Columbus.--The romantic and inspiring story\r\nof Columbus is told in many books,--his poverty, his genius, his\r\nlong and discouraging pursuit of the means to carry out his plan. He\r\nfirst applied to Portugal; but, as we have seen, this country had been\r\npursuing another plan steadily for a century, and, now that success\r\nappeared almost at hand, naturally the Portuguese king would not turn\r\naside to favor Columbus's plan.\r\n\r\nFor years Columbus labored to interest the Spanish court. A great event\r\nhad happened in Spanish history. Ferdinand, king of Aragon, had wedded\r\nIsabella of Castile, and this marriage united these two kingdoms into\r\nthe modern country of Spain. Soon the smaller states except Portugal\r\nwere added, and the war for the expulsion of the Moors was prosecuted\r\nwith new vigor. In 1492, Grenada, the last splendid stronghold of\r\nthe Mohammedans in the peninsula, surrendered, and in the same year\r\nIsabella furnished Columbus with the ships for his voyage of discovery.\r\n\r\nColumbus sailed from Palos, August 3, 1492, reached the Canaries\r\nAugust 24, and sailed westward on September 6. Day after day, pushed\r\nby the strong winds, called the \"trades,\" they went forward. Many\r\ndoubts and fears beset the crews, but Columbus was stout-hearted. At\r\nthe end of thirty-four days from the Canaries, on October 12, they\r\nsighted land. It was one of the groups of beautiful islands lying\r\nbetween the two continents of America. But Columbus thought that he\r\nhad reached the East Indies that really lay many thousands of miles\r\nfarther west. Columbus sailed among the islands of the archipelago,\r\ndiscovered Cuba and Hispaniola (Haiti), and then returned to convulse\r\nEurope with excitement over the new-found way to the East. He had\r\nnot found the rich Spice Islands, the peninsula of India, Cathay or\r\nJapan, but every one believed that these must be close to the islands\r\non which Columbus had landed.\r\n\r\nThe tall, straight-haired, copper-colored natives, whom Columbus met on\r\nthe islands, he naturally called \"Indians\"; and this name they still\r\nbear. Afterwards the islands were called the \"West Indies.\" Columbus\r\nmade three more voyages for Spain. On the fourth, in 1498, he touched\r\non the coast of South America. Here he discovered the great Orinoco\r\nRiver. Because of its large size, he must have realized that a large\r\nbody of land opposed the passage to the Orient. He died in 1506,\r\ndisappointed at his failure to find India, but never knowing what he\r\nhad found, nor that the history of a new hemisphere had begun with him.\r\n\r\nThe Voyage of the Cabots.--In the same year that Columbus discovered\r\nthe Orinoco, Sebastian Cabot, of Italian parentage, like Columbus,\r\nsecured ships from the king of England, hoping to reach China and\r\nJapan by sailing west on a northern route. What he did discover was\r\na rugged and uninviting coast, with stormy headlands, cold climate,\r\nand gloomy forests of pine reaching down to the sandy shores. For nine\r\nhundred miles he sailed southward, but everywhere this unprofitable\r\ncoast closed the passage to China. It was the coast of Labrador and\r\nthe United States. Yet for years and years it was not known that a\r\ncontinent three thousand miles wide and the greatest of all oceans\r\nlay between Cathay and the shore visited by Cabot's ships. This land\r\nwas thought to be a long peninsula, an island, or series of islands,\r\nbelonging to Asia. No one supposed or could suppose that there was\r\na continent here.\r\n\r\nNaming the New World.--But in a few years Europe did realize that a\r\nnew continent had been discovered in South America. If you will look\r\nat your maps, you will see that South America lies far to the eastward\r\nof North America and in Brazil approaches very close to Africa. This\r\nBrazilian coast was visited by a Portuguese fleet on the African route\r\nin 1499, and two years later an Italian fleet traversed the coast from\r\nthe Orinoco to the harbor of Rio Janeiro. Their voyage was a veritable\r\nrevelation. They entered the mighty current of the Amazon, the greatest\r\nriver of the earth. They saw the wondrous tropical forests, full of\r\nmonkeys, great snakes, and stranger animals. They dealt and fought\r\nwith the wild and ferocious inhabitants, whose ways startled and\r\nappalled the European. All that they saw filled them with greatest\r\nwonder. This evidently was not Asia, nor was it the Indies. Here,\r\nin fact, was a new continent, a veritable \"Mundus Novus.\"\r\n\r\nThe pilot of this expedition was an Italian, named Amerigo Vespucci. On\r\nthe return this man wrote a very interesting letter or little pamphlet,\r\ndescribing this new world, which was widely read, and brought the\r\nwriter fame. A few years later a German cosmographer, in preparing\r\na new edition of Ptolemy's geography, proposed to give to this new\r\ncontinent the name of the man who had made known its wonders in Europe,\r\nSo it was called \"America.\" Long after, when the northern shores were\r\nalso proved to be those of a continent, this great land was named\r\n\"North America.\" No injustice was intended to Columbus when America\r\nwas so named. It was not then supposed that Columbus had discovered\r\na continent. The people then believed that Columbus had found a new\r\nroute to India and had discovered some new islands that lay off the\r\ncoast of Asia.\r\n\r\nSpain Takes Possession of the New Lands.--Of these newly found islands\r\nand whatever wealth they might be found to contain, Spain claimed\r\nthe possession by right of discovery. And of the European nations,\r\nit was Spain which first began the exploration and colonization of\r\nAmerica. Spain was now free from her long Mohammedan wars, and the\r\nnation was being united under Ferdinand and Isabella. The Spaniards\r\nwere brave, adventurous, and too proud to engage in commerce or\r\nagriculture, but ready enough to risk life and treasure in quest of\r\nriches abroad. The Spaniards were devotedly religious, and the Church\r\nencouraged conquest, that missionary work might be extended. So Spain\r\nbegan her career that was soon to make her the foremost power of Europe\r\nand one of the greatest colonial empires the world has seen. It is\r\namazing what the Spaniards accomplished in the fifty years following\r\nColumbus's first voyage.\r\n\r\nHispaniola was made the center from which the Spaniards extended\r\ntheir explorations to the continents of both North and South\r\nAmerica. On these islands of the West Indies they found a great tribe\r\nof Indians,--the Caribs. They were fierce and cruel. The Spaniards\r\nwaged a warfare of extermination against them, killing many, and\r\nenslaving others for work in the mines. The Indian proved unable to\r\nexist as a slave. And his sufferings drew the attention of a Spanish\r\npriest, Las Casas, who by vigorous efforts at the court succeeded in\r\nhaving Indian slavery abolished and African slavery introduced to\r\ntake its place. This remedy was in the end worse than the disease,\r\nfor it gave an immense impetus to the African slave-trade and peopled\r\nAmerica with a race of Africans in bondage.\r\n\r\nOther Spanish Explorations and Discoveries.--Meanwhile, the Spanish\r\nsoldier, with incredible energy, courage, and daring, pushed his\r\nconquests. In 1513, Florida was discovered, and in the same year,\r\nBalboa crossed the narrow isthmus of Panama and saw the Pacific\r\nOcean. Contrary to what is often supposed, he did not dream of its vast\r\nextent, but supposed it to be a narrow body of water lying between\r\nPanama, and the Asian islands. He named it the \"South Sea,\" a name\r\nthat survived after its true character was revealed by Magellan. Then\r\nfollowed the two most romantic and surprising conquests of colonial\r\nhistory,--that of Mexico by Cortes in 1521, and of Peru by Pizarro\r\nin 1533-34. These great countries were inhabited by Indians, the\r\nmost advanced and cultured on the American continents. And here the\r\nSpaniards found enormous treasures of gold and silver. Then, the\r\ndiscovery of the mines of Bogota opened the greatest source of the\r\nprecious metal that Europe had ever known. Spaniards flocked to the\r\nNew World, and in New Spain, as Mexico was called, was established a\r\ngreat vice-royalty. Year after year enormous wealth was poured into\r\nSpain from these American possessions.\r\n\r\nEmperor Charles V.--Meanwhile great political power had been added\r\nto Spain in Europe. In 1520 the throne of Spain fell to a young man,\r\nCharles, the grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella. His mother was Juana,\r\nthe Spanish princess, and his father was Philip the Handsome, of\r\nBurgundy. Philip the Handsome was the son of Maximilian, the Archduke\r\nof Austria. Now it curiously happened that the thrones of each of these\r\nthree countries was left without other heirs than Charles, and in 1520\r\nhe was King of Spain, Archduke of Austria, and Duke of Burgundy and\r\nthe Low Countries, including the rich commercial cities of Holland\r\nand Belgium. In addition to all this, the German princes elected him\r\nGerman emperor, and although he was King Charles the First of Spain,\r\nhe is better known in history as Emperor Charles the Fifth. [4]\r\n\r\nHe was then an untried boy of twenty years, and no one expected to\r\nfind in him a man of resolute energy, cold persistence, and great\r\nexecutive ability. But so it proved, and this was the man that\r\nmade of Spain the greatest power of the time. He was in constant\r\nwarfare. He fought four wars with King Francis I. of France, five\r\nwars with the Turks, both in the Danube valley and in Africa, and\r\nan unending succession of contests with the Protestant princes of\r\nGermany. For Charles, besides many other important changes, saw the\r\nrise of Protestantism, and the revolt of Germany, Switzerland, and\r\nEngland from Catholicism. The first event in his emperorship was the\r\nassembling of the famous German Diet at Worms, where was tried and\r\ncondemned the real founder of the Protestant religion, Martin Luther.\r\n\r\nThe Voyage of Hernando Magellan.--In the mean time a way had at last\r\nbeen found to reach the Orient from Europe by sailing west. This\r\ndiscovery, the greatest voyage ever made by man, was accomplished, in\r\n1521, by the fleet of Hernando Magellan. Magellan was a Portuguese, who\r\nhad been in the East with Albuquerque. He had fought with the Malays\r\nin Malacca, and had helped to establish the Portuguese power in India.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Portugal, the injustice of the court drove him from\r\nhis native country, and he entered the service of Spain. Charles the\r\nFifth commissioned him to attempt a voyage of discovery down the\r\ncoast of South America, with the hope of finding a passage to the\r\nEast. This was Magellan's great hope and faith,--that south of the\r\nnew continent of America must lie a passage westward, by which ships\r\ncould sail to China. As long as Portugal was able to keep closed the\r\nAfrican route to all other ships than her own, the discovery of some\r\nother way was imperative.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of September, 1519, Magellan's fleet of five ships set\r\nsail from Seville, which was the great Spanish shipping-port for the\r\ndispatch of the colonial fleets. On December 13 they reached the coast\r\nof Brazil and then coasted southward. They traded with the natives,\r\nand at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata stayed some days to fish.\r\n\r\nThe weather grew rapidly colder and more stormy as they went farther\r\nsouth, and Magellan decided to stop and winter in the Bay of San\r\nJulian. Here the cold of the winter, the storms, and the lack of\r\nfood caused a conspiracy among his captains to mutiny and return to\r\nSpain. Magellan acted with swift and terrible energy. He went himself\r\non board one of the mutinous vessels, killed the chief conspirator with\r\nhis own hand, executed another, and then \"marooned,\" or left to their\r\nfate on the shore, a friar and one other, who were leaders in the plot.\r\n\r\nThe Straits of Magellan.--The fleet sailed southward again in August\r\nbut it was not until November 1, 1520, that Magellan entered the\r\nlong and stormy straits that bear his name and which connect the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific oceans. South of them were great bleak islands,\r\ncold and desolate. They were inhabited by Indians, who are probably\r\nthe lowest and most wretched savages on the earth. They live on fish\r\nand mussels. As they go at all times naked, they carry with them in\r\ntheir boats brands and coals of fire. Seeing the numerous lights on\r\nthe shore, Magellan named these islands Tierra del Fuego (the Land\r\nof Fire). For twenty days the ships struggled with the contrary and\r\nshifting winds that prevail in this channel, during which time one\r\nship deserted and returned to Spain. Then the remaining four ships\r\npassed out onto the boundless waters of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nWestward on the Pacific Ocean.--But we must not make the mistake\r\nof supposing that Magellan and his followers imagined that a great\r\nocean confronted them. They expected that simply sailing northward to\r\nthe latitude of the Spice Islands would bring them to these desired\r\nplaces. This they did, and then turned westward, expecting each day\r\nto find the Indies; but no land appeared. The days lengthened into\r\nweeks, the weeks into months, and still they went forward, carried\r\nby the trade winds over a sea so smooth and free from tempests that\r\nMagellan named it the \"Pacific.\"\r\n\r\nBut they suffered horribly from lack of food, even eating in their\r\nstarvation the leather slings on the masts. It was a terrible trial\r\nof their courage. Twenty of their number died. The South Pacific\r\nis studded with islands, but curiously their route lay just too far\r\nnorth to behold them. From November 28, when they emerged from the\r\nStraits of Magellan, until March 7, when they reached the Ladrones,\r\nthey encountered only two islands, and these were small uninhabited\r\nrocks, without water or food, which in their bitter disappointment\r\nthey named las Desventuradas (the Unfortunate Islands).\r\n\r\nThe Ladrone Islands.--Their relief must have been inexpressible when,\r\non coming up to land on March the 7th, they found inhabitants and\r\nfood, yams, cocoanuts, and rice. At these islands the Spaniards\r\nfirst saw the prao, with its light outrigger, and pointed sail. So\r\nnumerous were these craft that they named the group las Islas de las\r\nVelas (the Islands of Sails); but the loss of a ship's boat and other\r\nannoying thefts led the sailors to designate the islands Los Ladrones\r\n(the Thieves), a name which they still retain.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands.--Samar.--Leaving the Ladrones Magellan\r\nsailed on westward looking for the Moluccas, and the first land\r\nthat he sighted was the eastern coast of Samar. Pigafetta says:\r\n\"Saturday, the 16th of March, we sighted an island which has very\r\nlofty mountains. Soon after we learned that it was Zamal, distant\r\nthree hundred leagues from the islands of the Ladrones.\" [5]\r\n\r\nHomonhon.--On the following day the sea-worn expedition, landed on\r\na little uninhabited island south of Samar which Pigafetta called\r\nHumunu, and which is still known as Homonhon or Jomonjol.\r\n\r\nIt was while staying at this little island that the Spaniards first\r\nsaw the people of the Philippines. A prao which contained nine men\r\napproached their ship. They saw other boats fishing near and learned\r\nthat all of these people came from the island of Suluan, which lies\r\noff to the eastward from Jomonjol about twenty kilometres. In their\r\nlife and appearance these fishing people were much like the present\r\nSamal laut of southern Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago.\r\n\r\nLimasaua.--Pigafetta says that they stayed on the island of Jomonjol\r\neight days but had great difficulty in securing food. The natives\r\nbrought them a few cocoanuts and oranges, palm wine, and a chicken\r\nor two, but this was all that could be spared, so, on the 25th,\r\nthe Spaniards sailed again, and near the south end of Leyte landed\r\non the little island of Limasaua. Here there was a village, where\r\nthey met two chieftains, whom Pigafetta calls \"kings,\" and whose\r\nnames were Raja Calambu and Raja Ciagu. These two chieftains were\r\nvisiting Limasaua and had their residences one at Butuan and one\r\nat Cagayan on the island of Mindanao. Some histories have stated\r\nthat the Spaniards accompanied one of these chieftains to Butuan,\r\nbut this does not appear to have been the case.\r\n\r\nOn the island of Limasaua the natives had dogs, cats, hogs, goats,\r\nand fowls. They were cultivating rice, maize, breadfruit, and had\r\nalso cocoanuts, oranges, bananas, citron, and ginger. Pigafetta tells\r\nhow he visited one of the chieftains at his home on the shore. The\r\nhouse was built as Filipino houses are today, raised on posts and\r\nthatched. Pigafetta thought it looked \"like a haystack.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been the day of San Lazarus when the Spaniards first reached\r\nthese islands, so that Magellan gave to the group the name of the\r\nArchipelago of Saint Lazarus, the name under which the Philippines were\r\nfrequently described in the early writings, although another title,\r\nIslas del Poniente or Islands of the West, was more common up to the\r\ntime when the title Filipinas became fixed.\r\n\r\nCebu.--Magellan's people were now getting desperately in need of\r\nfood, and the population on Limasaua had very inadequate supplies;\r\nconsequently the natives directed him to the island of Cebu, and\r\nprovided him with guides.\r\n\r\nLeaving Limasaua the fleet sailed for Cebu, passing several large\r\nislands, among them Bohol, and reaching Cebu harbor on Sunday, the\r\n7th of April. A junk from Siam was anchored at Cebu when Magellan's\r\nships arrived there; and this, together with the knowledge that the\r\nFilipinos showed of the surrounding countries, including China on\r\nthe one side and the Moluccas on the other, is additional evidence\r\nof the extensive trade relations at the time of the discovery.\r\n\r\nCebu seems to have been a large town and it is reported that more\r\nthan two thousand warriors with their lances appeared to resist the\r\nlanding of the Spaniards, but assurances of friendliness finally won\r\nthe Filipinos, and Magellan formed a compact with the dato of Cebu,\r\nwhose name was Hamalbar.\r\n\r\nThe Blood Compact.--The dato invited Magellan to seal this compact in\r\naccordance with a curious custom of the Filipinos. Each chief wounded\r\nhimself in the breast and from the wound each sucked and drank the\r\nother's blood. It is not certain whether Magellan participated in this\r\n\"blood compact,\" as it has been called; but later it was observed many\r\ntimes in the Spanish settlement of the islands, especially by Legaspi.\r\n\r\nThe natives were much struck by the service of the mass, which the\r\nSpaniards celebrated on their landing, and after some encouragement\r\ndesired to be admitted to the Spaniards' religion. More than eight\r\nhundred were baptized, including Hamalbar. The Spaniards established\r\na kind of \"factory\" or trading-post on Cebu, and for some time a\r\nprofitable trade was engaged in. The Filipinos well understood trading,\r\nhad scales, weights, and measures, and were fair dealers.\r\n\r\nDeath of Magellan.--And now follows the great tragedy of\r\nthe expedition. The dato of Cebu, or the \"Christian king,\" as\r\nPigafetta called their new ally, was at war with the islanders of\r\nMactan. Magellan, eager to assist one who had adopted the Christian\r\nfaith, landed on Mactan with fifty men and in the battle that ensued\r\nwas killed by an arrow through the leg and spear-thrust through the\r\nbreast. So died the one who was unquestionably the greatest explorer\r\nand most daring adventurer of all time. \"Thus,\" says Pigafetta,\r\n\"perished our guide, our light, and our support.\" It was the crowning\r\ndisaster of the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe Fleet Visits Other Islands.--After Magellan's death, the natives of\r\nCebu rose and killed the newly elected leader, Serrano, and the fleet\r\nin fear lifted its anchors and sailed southward from the Bisayas. They\r\nhad lost thirty-five men and their numbers were reduced to one hundred\r\nand fifteen. One of the ships was burned, there being too few men\r\nsurviving to handle three vessels. After touching at western Mindanao,\r\nthey sailed westward, and saw the small group of Cagayan Sulu. The few\r\ninhabitants they learned were Moros, exiled from Borneo. They landed\r\non Paragua, called Puluan (hence Palawan), where they observed the\r\nsport of cock-fighting, indulged in by the natives.\r\n\r\nFrom here, still searching for the Moluccas, they were guided to\r\nBorneo, the present city of Brunei. Here was the powerful Mohammedan\r\ncolony, whose adventurers were already in communication with Luzon and\r\nhad established a colony on the site of Manila. The city was divided\r\ninto two sections, that of the Mohammedan Malays, the conquerors, and\r\nthat of the Dyaks, the primitive population of the island. Pigafetta\r\nexclaims over the riches and power of this Mohammedan city. It\r\ncontained twenty-five thousand families, the houses built for most\r\npart on piles over the water. The king's house was of stone, and\r\nbeside it was a great brick fort, with over sixty brass and iron\r\ncannon. Here the Spaniards saw elephants and camels, and there was\r\na rich trade in ginger, camphor, gums, and in pearls from Sulu.\r\n\r\nHostilities cut short their stay here and they sailed eastward\r\nalong the north coast of Borneo through the Sulu Archipelago,\r\nwhere their cupidity was excited by the pearl fisheries, and on\r\nto Maguindanao. Here they took some prisoners, who piloted them\r\nsouth to the Moluccas, and finally, on November 8, they anchored\r\nat Tidor. These Molucca islands, at this time, were at the height\r\nof the Malayan power. The ruler, or raja of Tidor was Almanzar,\r\nof Ternate Corala; the \"king\" of Gilolo was Yusef. With all these\r\nrulers the Spaniards exchanged presents, and the rajas are said by\r\nthe Spaniards to have sworn perpetual amnesty to the Spaniards and\r\nacknowledged themselves vassals of the king. In exchange for cloths,\r\nthe Spaniards laid in a rich cargo of cloves, sandalwood, ginger,\r\ncinnamon, and gold. They established here a trading-post and hoped\r\nto hold these islands against the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThe Return to Spain.--It was decided to send one ship, the \"Victoria,\"\r\nto Spain by way of the Portuguese route and the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nwhile the other would return to America. Accordingly the \"Victoria,\"\r\nwith a little crew of sixty men, thirteen of them natives, under\r\nthe command of Juan Sebastian del Cano, set sail. The passage was\r\nunknown to the Spaniards and full of perils. They sailed to Timor\r\nand thence out into the Indian Ocean. They rounded Africa, sailing\r\nas far south as 42 degrees. Then they went northward, in constant\r\nperil of capture by some Portuguese fleet, encountering storms and\r\nwith scarcity of food. Their distress must have been extreme, for on\r\nthis final passage twenty-one of their small number died.\r\n\r\nAt Cape Verdi they entered the Portuguese port for supplies,\r\ntrusting that at so northern a point their real voyage would\r\nnot be suspected. But some one of the party, who went ashore for\r\nfood, in an hour of intoxication boasted of the wonderful journey\r\nthey had performed and showed some of the products of the Spice\r\nIslands. Immediately the Portuguese governor gave orders for the\r\nseizure of the Spanish vessel and El Cano, learning of his danger, left\r\nhis men, who had gone on shore, raised sail, and put out for Spain.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of September, 1522, they arrived at San Lucar, at the mouth\r\nof the Guadalquivir River, on which is situated Seville, one ship\r\nout of the five, and eighteen men out of the company of 234, who had\r\nset sail almost three full years before. Spain welcomed her worn and\r\ntired seamen with splendid acclaim. To El Cano was given a title of\r\nnobility and the famous coat-of-arms, showing the sprays of clove,\r\ncinnamon, and nutmeg, and the effigy of the globe with the motto,\r\nthe proudest and worthiest ever displayed on any adventurer's shield,\r\n\"Hic primus circumdedisti me.\"\r\n\r\nThe First Circumnavigation of the Earth.--Thus with enormous suffering\r\nand loss of life was accomplished the first circumnavigation of the\r\nearth. It proved that Asia could be reached, although by a long and\r\ncircuitous route, by sailing westward from Europe. It made known to\r\nEurope that the greatest of all oceans lies between the New World and\r\nAsia, and it showed that the earth is incomparably larger than had been\r\nbelieved and supposed. It was the greatest voyage of discovery that has\r\never been accomplished, and greater than can ever be performed again.\r\n\r\nNew Lands Divided between Spain and Portugal.--By this discovery of the\r\nPhilippines and a new way to the Spice Islands, Spain became engaged\r\nin a long dispute with Portugal. At the beginning of the modern age,\r\nthere was in Europe no system of rules by which to regulate conduct\r\nbetween states. That system of regulations and customs which we\r\ncall International Law, and by which states at the present time are\r\nguided in their dealings, had not arisen. During the middle age,\r\ndisputes between sovereigns were frequently settled by reference to\r\nthe emperor or to the pope, and the latter had frequently asserted\r\nhis right to determine all such questions as might arise. The pope\r\nhad also claimed to have the right of disposing of all heathen and\r\nnewly discovered lands and peoples.\r\n\r\nSo, after the discovery of the East Indies by Portugal and of the West\r\nIndies by Spain, Pope Alexander VI., divided the new lands between\r\nthem. He declared that all newly discovered countries halfway around\r\nthe earth to the east of a meridian 100 leagues west of the Azores\r\nshould be Portuguese, and all to the west Spanish. Subsequently he\r\nshifted this line to 270 leagues west of the Azores. This division,\r\nit was supposed, would give India and the Malay islands to Portugal,\r\nand to Spain the Indies that Columbus had discovered, and the New\r\nWorld, except Brazil.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, 180 degrees west of the meridian last set by\r\nthe pope extended to the western part of New Guinea, and not quite\r\nto the Moluccas; but in the absence of exact geographical knowledge\r\nboth parties claimed the Spice Islands. Portugal denied to Spain all\r\nright to the Philippines as well, and, as we shall see, a conflict in\r\nthe Far East began, which lasted nearly through the century. Portugal\r\ncaptured the traders, whom El Cano had left at Tidor, and broke up the\r\nSpanish station in the Spice Islands. The \"Trinidad,\" the other ship,\r\nwhich was intended to return to America, was unable to sail against\r\nthe strong winds, and had to put back to Tidor, after cruising through\r\nthe waters about New Guinea.\r\n\r\nEffect of the Century of Discoveries.--This circumnavigation of the\r\nglobe completed a period of discovery which had begun a hundred years\r\nbefore with the timid, slow attempts of the Portuguese along the coast\r\nof Africa. In these years a new era had opened. At its beginning the\r\nEuropean knew little of any peoples outside of his own countries,\r\nand he held not one mile of land outside the continent of Europe. At\r\nthe end of a hundred years the earth had become fairly well known,\r\nthe African race, the Malay peoples, the American Indians, and the\r\nPacific islanders had all been seen and described, and from now on the\r\nhistory of the white race was to be connected with that of these other\r\nraces. The age of colonization, of world-wide trade and intercourse,\r\nhad begun. The white man, who had heretofore been narrowly pressed\r\nin upon Europe, threatened again and again with conquest by the\r\nMohammedan, was now to cover the seas with his fleets and all lands\r\nwith his power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE FILIPINO PEOPLE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE SPANIARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosition of Tribes.--On the arrival of the Spaniards, the population\r\nof the Philippines seems to have been distributed by tribes in much\r\nthe same manner as at present. Then, as now, the Bisaya occupied the\r\ncentral islands of the archipelago and some of the northern coast of\r\nMindanao. The Bicol, Tagalog, and Pampango were in the same parts of\r\nLuzon as we find them to-day. The Ilocano occupied the coastal plain\r\nfacing the China Sea, but since the arrival of the Spaniards they\r\nhave expanded considerably and their settlements are now numerous in\r\nPangasinan, Nueva Vizcaya, and the valley of the Cagayan.\r\n\r\nThe Number of People.--These tribes which to-day number nearly\r\n7,000,000 souls, at the time of Magellan's discovery were, probably,\r\nnot more than 500,000. The first enumeration of the population made\r\nby the Spaniards in 1591, and which included practically all of these\r\ntribes, gives a population of less than 700,000. (See Chapter VIII.,\r\nThe Philippines Three Hundred Years Ago.)\r\n\r\nThere are other facts too that show us how sparse the population must\r\nhave been. The Spanish expeditions found many coasts and islands in\r\nthe Bisayan group without inhabitants. Occasionally a sail or a canoe\r\nwould be seen, and then these would disappear in some small \"estero\"\r\nor mangrove swamp and the land seem as unpopulated as before. At\r\ncertain points, like Limasaua, Butuan, and Bohol, the natives were\r\nmore numerous, and Cebu was a large and thriving community; but the\r\nSpaniards had nearly everywhere to search for settled places and\r\ncultivated lands.\r\n\r\nThe sparsity of population is also well indicated by the great scarcity\r\nof food. The Spaniards had much difficulty in securing sufficient\r\nprovisions. A small amount of rice, a pig and a few chickens,\r\nwere obtainable here and there, but the Filipinos had no large\r\nsupplies. After the settlement of Manila was made, a large part of\r\nthe food of the city was drawn from China. The very ease with which\r\nthe Spaniards marched where they willed and reduced the Filipinos\r\nto obedience shows that the latter were weak in numbers. Laguna and\r\nthe Camarines seem to have been the most populous portions of the\r\narchipelago. All of these things and others show that the Filipinos\r\nwere but a small fraction of their present number.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Negritos seem to have been more numerous,\r\nor at least more in evidence. They were immediately noticed on the\r\nisland of Negros, where at the present they are few and confined to\r\nthe interior; and in the vicinity of Manila and in Batangas, where they\r\nare no longer found, they were mingling with the Tagalog population.\r\n\r\nConditions of Culture.--The culture of the various tribes, which\r\nis now quite the same throughout the archipelago, presented some\r\ndifferences. In the southern Bisayas, where the Spaniards first entered\r\nthe archipelago, there seem to have been two kinds of natives: the\r\nhill dwellers, who lived in the interior of the islands in small\r\nnumbers, who wore garments of tree bark and who sometimes built\r\ntheir houses in the trees; and the sea dwellers, who were very much\r\nlike the present day Moro tribes south of Mindanao, who are known as\r\nthe Samal, and who built their villages over the sea or on the shore\r\nand lived much in boats. These were probably later arrivals than the\r\nforest people. From both of these elements the Bisaya Filipinos are\r\ndescended, but while the coast people have been entirely absorbed,\r\nsome of the hill-folk are still pagan and uncivilized, and must be\r\nvery much as they were when the Spaniards first came.\r\n\r\nThe highest grade of culture was in the settlements where there was\r\nregular trade with Borneo, Siam, and China, and especially about\r\nManila, where many Mohammedan Malays had colonies.\r\n\r\nLanguages of the Malayan Peoples.--With the exception of the Negrito,\r\nall the languages of the Philippines belong to one great family,\r\nwhich has been called the \"Malayo-Polynesian.\" All are believed to\r\nbe derived from one very ancient mother-tongue. It is astonishing how\r\nwidely this Malayo-Polynesian speech has spread. Farthest east in the\r\nPacific there is the Polynesian, then in the groups of small islands,\r\nknown as Micronesian; then Melanesian or Papuan; the Malayan throughout\r\nthe East Indian archipelago, and to the north the languages of the\r\nPhilippines. But this is not all; for far westward on the coast of\r\nAfrica is the island of Madagascar, many of whose languages have no\r\nconnection with African but belong to the Malayo-Polynesian family. [6]\r\n\r\nThe Tagalog Language.--It should be a matter of great interest to\r\nFilipinos that the great scientist, Baron William von Humboldt,\r\nconsidered the Tagalog to be the richest and most perfect of all\r\nthe languages of the Malayo-Polynesian family, and perhaps the type\r\nof them all. \"It possesses,\" he said, \"all the forms collectively\r\nof which particular ones are found singly in other dialects; and it\r\nhas preserved them all with very trifling exceptions unbroken, and in\r\nentire harmony and symmetry.\" The Spanish friars, on their arrival in\r\nthe Philippines, devoted themselves at once to learning the native\r\ndialects and to the preparation of prayers and catechisms in these\r\nnative tongues. They were very successful in their studies. Father\r\nChirino tells us of one Jesuit who learned sufficient Tagalog in\r\nseventy days to preach and hear confession. In this way the Bisayan,\r\nthe Tagalog, and the Ilocano were soon mastered.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the opinion of Von Humboldt, it is interesting to\r\nfind these early Spaniards pronouncing the Tagalog the most difficult\r\nand the most admirable. \"Of all of them,\" says Padre Chirino, \"the\r\none which most pleased me and filled me with admiration was the\r\nTagalog. Because, as I said to the first archbishop, and afterwards\r\nto other serious persons, both there and here, I found in it four\r\nqualities of the four best languages of the world: Hebrew, Greek,\r\nLatin, and Spanish; of the Hebrew, the mysteries and obscurities; of\r\nthe Greek, the articles and the precision not only of the appellative\r\nbut also of the proper nouns; of the Latin, the wealth and elegance;\r\nand of the Spanish, the good breeding, politeness, and courtesy.\" [7]\r\n\r\nAn Early Connection with the Hindus.--The Malayan languages contain\r\nalso a considerable proportion of words borrowed from the Sanskrit,\r\nand in this the Tagalog, Bisayan, and Ilocano are included. Whether\r\nthese words were passed along from one Malayan group to another,\r\nor whether they were introduced by the actual presence and power of\r\nthe Hindu in this archipelago, may be fair ground for debate; but the\r\ncase for the latter position has been so well and brilliantly put by\r\nDr. Pardo de Tavera that his conclusions are here given in his own\r\nwords. \"The words which Tagalog borrowed,\" he says, \"are those which\r\nsignify intellectual acts, moral conceptions, emotions, superstitions,\r\nnames of deities, of planets, of numerals of high number, of botany,\r\nof war and its results and consequences, and finally of titles and\r\ndignities, some animals, instruments of industry, and the names\r\nof money.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence of these works, Dr. Pardo argues for a period\r\nin the early history of the Filipinos, not merely of commercial\r\nintercourse, like that of the Chinese, but of Hindu political and\r\nsocial domination. \"I do not believe,\" he says, \"and I base my opinion\r\non the same words that I have brought together in this vocabulary,\r\nthat the Hindus were here simply as merchants, but that they dominated\r\ndifferent parts of the archipelago, where to-day are spoken the\r\nmost cultured languages,--the Tagalo, the Visayan, the Pampanga,\r\nand the Ilocano; and that the higher culture of these languages comes\r\nprecisely from the influence of the Hindu race over the Filipino.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hindus in the Philippines.--\"It is impossible to believe that the\r\nHindus, if they came only as merchants, however great their number,\r\nwould have impressed themselves in such a way as to give to these\r\nislanders the number and the kind of words which they did give. These\r\nnames of dignitaries, of caciques, of high functionaries of the court,\r\nof noble ladies, indicate that all of these high positions with\r\nnames of Sanskrit origin were occupied at one time by men who spoke\r\nthat language. The words of a similar origin for objects of war,\r\nfortresses, and battle-songs, for designating objects of religious\r\nbelief, for superstitions, emotions, feelings, industrial and farming\r\nactivities, show us clearly that the warfare, religion, literature,\r\nindustry, and agriculture were at one time in the hands of the Hindus,\r\nand that this race was effectively dominant in the Philippines.\" [8]\r\n\r\nSystems of Writing among the Filipinos.--When the Spaniards arrived in\r\nthe Philippines, the Filipinos were using systems of writing borrowed\r\nfrom Hindu or Javanese sources. This matter is so interesting that\r\none can not do better than to quote in full Padre Chirino's account,\r\nas he is the first of the Spanish writers to mention it and as his\r\nnotice is quite complete.\r\n\r\n\"So given are these islanders to reading and writing that there is\r\nhardly a man, and much less a woman, that does not read and write in\r\nletters peculiar to the island of Manila, very different from those\r\nof China, Japan, and of India, as will be seen from the following\r\nalphabet.\r\n\r\n\"The vowels are three; but they serve for five, and are,\r\n\r\n\r\n                           a    e, i    o, u\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consonants are no more than twelve, and they serve to write both\r\nconsonant and vowel, in this form. The letter alone, without any\r\npoint either above or below, sounds with a.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Ba    ca    da    ga    ha    la\r\n                    ma    na    pa    sa    ta    ya\r\n\r\n\r\nPlacing the point above, each one sounds with e or with i.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Bi    qui   di    gui   hi    li\r\n                    be    que   de    gue   he    le\r\n\r\n                    mi    ni    pi    si    ti    yi\r\n                    me    ne    pe    se    te    ye\r\n\r\n\r\nPlacing the point below, it sounds with o or with u.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    bo    co    do    go    ho    lo\r\n                    bu    cu    du    gu    hu    lu\r\n\r\n                    mo    no    po    so    to    yo\r\n                    mu    nu    pu    su    tu    yu\r\n\r\n\r\nFor instance, in order to say 'cama,' the two letters alone suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ca ma\r\n\r\n\r\nIf to the ka there is placed a point above, it will say\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 que ma\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it is given to both below, it will say\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 co mo\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final consonants are supplied or understood in all cases, and so\r\nto say 'cantar,' they write\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ca ta\r\n\r\n\r\nbarba,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ba ba\r\n\r\n\r\nBut with all, and that without many evasions, they make themselves\r\nunderstood, and they themselves understand marvellously. And the\r\nreader supplies, with much skill and ease, the consonants that are\r\nlacking. They have learned from us to write running the lines from\r\nthe left hand to the right, but formerly they only wrote from above\r\ndownwards, placing the first line (if I remember rightly) at the left\r\nhand, and continuing with the others to the right, the opposite of\r\nthe Chinese and Japanese.... They write upon canes or on leaves of a\r\npalm, using for a pen a point of iron. Nowadays in writing not only\r\ntheir own but also our letters, they use a feather very well cut,\r\nand paper like ourselves.\r\n\r\nThey have learned our language and pronunciation, and write as well\r\nas we do, and even better; for they are so bright that they learn\r\neverything with the greatest ease. I have brought with me handwriting\r\nwith very good and correct lettering. In Tigbauan, I had in school a\r\nvery small child, who in three months' time learned, by copying from\r\nwell-written letters that I set him, to write enough better than I,\r\nand transcribed for me writings of importance very faithfully, and\r\nwithout errors or mistakes. But enough of languages and letters;\r\nnow let us return to our occupation with human souls.\" [9]\r\n\r\nSanskrit Source of the Filipino Alphabet.--Besides the Tagalog,\r\nthe Bisaya, Pampango, Pangasinan, and Ilocano had alphabets, or\r\nmore properly syllabaries similar to this one. Dr. Pardo de Tavera\r\nhas gathered many data concerning them, and shows that they were\r\nundoubtedly received by the Filipinos from a Sanskrit source.\r\n\r\nEarly Filipino Writings.--The Filipinos used this writing for setting\r\ndown their poems and songs, which were their only literature. None\r\nof this, however, has come down to us, and the Filipinos soon adopted\r\nthe Spanish alphabet, forming the syllables necessary to write their\r\nlanguage from these letters. As all these have phonetic values,\r\nit is still very easy for a Filipino to learn to pronounce and so\r\nread his own tongue. These old characters lingered for a couple of\r\ncenturies, in certain places. Padre Totanes [10] tells us that it was\r\nrare in 1705 to find a person who could use them; but the Tagbanua,\r\na pagan people on the island of Paragua, use a similar syllabary\r\nto this day. Besides poems, they had songs which they sang as they\r\nrowed their canoes, as they pounded the rice from its husk, and as\r\nthey gathered for feast or entertainment; and especially there were\r\nsongs for the dead. In these songs, says Chirino, they recounted the\r\ndeeds of their ancestors or of their deities.\r\n\r\nChinese in the Philippines.--Early Trade.--Very different from the\r\nHindu was the early influence of the Chinese. There is no evidence\r\nthat, previous to the Spanish conquest, the Chinese settled or\r\ncolonized in these islands at all; and yet three hundred years\r\nbefore the arrival of Magellan their trading-fleets were coming here\r\nregularly and several of the islands were well known to them. One\r\nevidence of this prehistoric trade is in the ancient Chinese jars and\r\npottery which have been exhumed in the vicinity of Manila, but the\r\nChinese writings themselves furnish us even better proof. About the\r\nbeginning of the thirteenth century, though not earlier than 1205,\r\na Chinese author named Chao Ju-kua wrote a work upon the maritime\r\ncommerce of the Chinese people. One chapter of his work is devoted to\r\nthe Philippines, which he calls the country of Mayi. [11] According\r\nto this record it is indicated that the Chinese were familiar with\r\nthe islands of the archipelago seven hundred years ago. [12]\r\n\r\nChinese, Description of the People.--\"The country of Mayi,\" says this\r\ninteresting classic, \"is situated to the north of Poni (Burney, or\r\nBorneo). About a thousand families inhabit the banks of a very winding\r\nstream. The natives clothe themselves in sheets of cloth resembling\r\nbed sheets, or cover their bodies with sarongs. (The sarong is the\r\ngay colored, typical garment of the Malay.) Scattered through the\r\nextensive forests are copper Buddha images, but no one knows how they\r\ngot there. [13]\r\n\r\n\"When the merchant (Chinese) ships arrive at this port they anchor\r\nin front of an open place ... which serves as a market, where they\r\ntrade in the produce of the country. When a ship enters this port,\r\nthe captain makes presents of white umbrellas (to the mandarins). The\r\nmerchants are obliged to pay this tribute in order to obtain the\r\ngood will of these lords.\" The products of the country are stated to\r\nbe yellow wax, cotton, pearls, shells, betel nuts, and yuta cloth,\r\nwhich was perhaps one of the several cloths still woven of abaca,\r\nor pina. The articles imported by the Chinese were \"porcelain, trade\r\ngold, objects of lead, glass beads of all colors, iron cooking-pans,\r\nand iron needles.\"\r\n\r\nThe Negritos.--Very curious is the accurate mention in this Chinese\r\nwriting, of the Negritos, the first of all accounts to be made of\r\nthe little blacks. \"In the interior of the valleys lives a race\r\ncalled Hai-tan (Acta). They are, of low stature, have round eyes of\r\na yellow color, curly hair, and their teeth are easily seen between\r\ntheir lips. (That is, probably, not darkened by betel-chewing or\r\nartificial stains.) They build their nests in the treetops and in\r\neach nest lives a family, which only consists of from three to five\r\npersons. They travel about in the densest thickets of the forests, and,\r\nwithout being seen themselves, shoot their arrows at the passers-by;\r\nfor this reason they are much feared. If the trader (Chinese) throws\r\nthem a small porcelain bowl, they will stoop down to catch it and\r\nthen run away with it, shouting joyfully.\"\r\n\r\nIncrease in Chinese Trade.--These junks also visited the more central\r\nislands, but here traffic was conducted on the ships, the Chinese\r\non arrival announcing themselves by beating gongs and the Filipinos\r\ncoming out to them in their light boats. Among other things here\r\noffered by the natives for trade are mentioned \"strange cloth,\"\r\nperhaps cinamay or jusi, and fine mats.\r\n\r\nThis Chinese trade continued probably quite steadily until the arrival\r\nof the Spaniards. Then it received an enormous increase through the\r\ndemand for Chinese food-products and wares made by the Spaniards,\r\nand because of the value of the Mexican silver which the Spaniards\r\noffered in exchange.\r\n\r\nTrade with the Moro Malays of the South.--The spread of Mohammedanism\r\nand especially the foundation of the colony of Borneo brought the\r\nPhilippines into important commercial relations with the Malays of the\r\nsouth. Previous to the arrival of the Spaniards these relations seem\r\nto have been friendly and peaceful. The Mohammedan Malays sent their\r\npraos northward for purposes of trade, and they were also settling\r\nin the north Philippines as they had in Mindanao.\r\n\r\nWhen Legaspi's fleet, soon after its arrival, lay near the island\r\nof Bohol, the \"Maestro de Campo\" had a hard fight with a Moro vessel\r\nwhich had come up for trade, and took six prisoners. One of them, whom\r\nthey call the \"pilot,\" was closely interrogated by the Adelantado\r\nand some interesting information obtained, which is recorded by\r\nPadre San Augustin. [14] Legaspi had a Malay slave interpreter with\r\nhim and San Augustin says that Padre Urdaneta \"knew well the Malayan\r\nlanguage.\" The pilot said that \"those of Borneo brought for trade with\r\nthe Filipinos, copper and tin, which was brought to Borneo from China,\r\nporcelain, dishes, and bells made in their fashion, very different from\r\nthose that the Christians use, and benzoin, and colored blankets from\r\nIndia, and cooking-pans made in China, and that they also brought iron\r\nlances very well tempered, and knives and other articles of barter,\r\nand that in exchange for them they took away from the islands gold,\r\nslaves, wax, and a kind of small seashell which they call 'sijueyes,'\r\nand which passes for money in the kingdom of Siam and other places;\r\nand also they carry off some white cloths, of which there is a great\r\nquantity in the islands.\"\r\n\r\nButuan, on the north coast of Mindanao, seems to have been quite a\r\ntrading-place resorted to by vessels from all quarters. This country,\r\nlike many other parts of the Philippines, has produced from time\r\nimmemorial small quantities of gold, and all the early voyagers\r\nspeak of the gold earrings and ornaments of the natives. Butuan\r\nalso produced sugarcane and was a trading-port for slaves. This\r\nunfortunate traffic in human life seems to have been not unusual,\r\nand was doubtless stimulated by the commerce with Borneo. Junks from\r\nSiam trading with Cebu were also encountered by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nResult of this Intercourse and Commerce.--This intercourse and\r\ntraffic had acquainted the Filipinos with many of the accessories\r\nof civilized life long before the arrival of the Spaniards. Their\r\nchiefs and datos dressed in silks, and maintained some splendor of\r\nsurroundings; nearly the whole population of the tribes of the coast\r\nwrote and communicated by means of a syllabary; vessels from Luzon\r\ntraded as far south as Mindanao and Borneo, although the products of\r\nAsia proper came through the fleets of foreigners; and perhaps what\r\nindicates more clearly than anything else the advance the Filipinos\r\nwere making through their communication with outside people is their\r\nuse of firearms. Of this point there is no question. Everywhere in\r\nthe vicinity of Manila, on Lubang, in Pampanga, at Cainta and Laguna\r\nde Bay, the Spaniards encountered forts mounting small cannon, or\r\n\"lantakas.\" [15] The Filipinos seem to have understood, moreover,\r\nthe arts of casting cannon and of making powder. The first gun-factory\r\nestablished by the Spaniards was in charge of a Filipino from Pampanga.\r\n\r\nEarly Political and Social Life.--The Barangay.--The weakest side\r\nof the culture of the early Filipinos was their political and social\r\norganization, and they were weak here in precisely the same way that\r\nthe now uncivilized peoples of northern Luzon are still weak. Their\r\nstate did not embrace the whole tribe or nation; it included simply\r\nthe community. Outside of the settlers in one immediate vicinity,\r\nall others were enemies or at most foreigners. There were in the\r\nPhilippines no large states, nor even great rajas and sultans such\r\nas were found in the Malay Archipelago, but instead on every island\r\nwere a multitude of small communities, each independent of the other\r\nand frequently waging war.\r\n\r\nThe unit of their political order was a little cluster of houses from\r\nthirty to one hundred families, called a \"barangay,\" and which still\r\nexists in the Philippines as the \"barrio.\" At the head of each barangay\r\nwas a chief known as the \"dato,\" a word no longer used in the northern\r\nPhilippines, though it persists among the Moros of Mindanao. The\r\npowers of these datos within their small areas appear to have been\r\ngreat, and they were treated with utmost respect by the people.\r\n\r\nThe barangays were grouped together in tiny federations including\r\nabout as much territory as the present towns, whose affairs were\r\nconducted by the chiefs or datos, although sometimes they seem to have\r\nall been in obedience to a single chief, known in some places as the\r\n\"hari,\" at other times by the Hindu word \"raja,\" or the Mohammedan\r\nterm \"sultan.\" Sometimes the power of one of these rajas seems to\r\nhave extended over the whole of a small island, but usually their\r\n\"kingdoms\" embraced only a few miles.\r\n\r\nChanges Made by the Spaniards.--The Spaniards, in enforcing their\r\nauthority through the islands, took away the real power from the\r\ndatos, grouping the barangays into towns, or \"pueblos,\" but making\r\nthe datos \"cabezas de barrio,\" or \"gobernadorcillos.\" Something of\r\nthe old distinction between the dato, or \"principal,\" and the common\r\nman may be still represented in the \"gente illustrada,\" or the more\r\nwealthy, educated, and influential class found in each town, and the\r\n\"gente baja,\" or the poor and uneducated.\r\n\r\nClasses of Filipinos under the Datos.--Beneath the datos, according\r\nto Chirino and Morga, there were three classes of Filipinos; the\r\nfree persons, or \"maharlica,\" who paid no tribute to the dato,\r\nbut who accompanied him to war, rowed his boat when he went on a\r\njourney, and attended him in his house. This class is called by Morga\r\n\"timauas.\" [16]\r\n\r\nThen there was a very large class, who appear to have been freedmen or\r\nliberated slaves, who had acquired their own homes and lived with their\r\nfamilies, but who owed to dato or maharlica heavy debts of service;\r\nto sow and harvest in his ricefields, to tend his fish-traps, to\r\nrow his canoe, to build his house, to attend him when he had guests,\r\nand to perform any other duties that the chief might command. These\r\nsemi-free were called \"aliping namamahay,\" and their condition of\r\nbondage descended to their children.\r\n\r\nBeneath these existed a class of slaves. These were the\r\n\"siguiguiliris,\" and they were numerous. Their slavery arose in several\r\nways. Some were those who as children had been captured in war and\r\ntheir lives spared. Some became slaves by selling their freedom in\r\ntimes of hunger. But most of them became slaves through debt, which\r\ndescended from father to son. The sum of five or six pesos was enough\r\nin some cases to deprive a man of his freedom.\r\n\r\nThese slaves were absolutely owned by their lord, who could\r\ntheoretically sell them like cattle; but, in spite of its bad\r\npossibilities, this Filipino slavery was ordinarily not of a cruel\r\nor distressing nature. The slaves frequently associated on kindly\r\nrelations with their masters and were not overworked. This form of\r\nslavery still persists in the Philippines among the Moros of Mindanao\r\nand Jolo. Children of slaves inherited their parents' slavery. If\r\none parent was free and the other slave, the first, third, and fifth\r\nchildren were free and the second, fourth, and sixth slaves. This\r\nwhole matter of inheritance of slavery was curiously worked out in\r\nminute details.\r\n\r\nLife in the Barangay.--Community feeling was very strong within the\r\nbarangay. A man could not leave his own barangay for life in another\r\nwithout the consent of the community and the payment of money. If a man\r\nof one barrio married a woman of another, their children were divided\r\nbetween the two barangays. The barangay was responsible for the good\r\nconduct of its members, and if one of them suffered an injury from\r\na man outside, the whole barangay had to be appeased. Disputes and\r\nwrongs between members of the same barangay were referred to a number\r\nof old men, who decided the matter in accordance with the customs of\r\nthe tribe, which were handed down by tradition. [17]\r\n\r\nThe Religion of the Filipinos.--The Filipinos on the arrival of\r\nthe Spaniards were fetish-worshipers, but they had one spirit whom\r\nthey believed was the greatest of all and the creator or maker of\r\nthings. The Tagalog called this deity Bathala, [18] the Bisaya,\r\nLaon, and the Ilocano, Kabunian. They also worshiped the spirits\r\nof their ancestors, which were represented by small images called\r\n\"anitos.\" Fetishes, which are any objects believed to possess\r\nmiraculous power, were common among the people, and idols or images\r\nwere worshiped. Pigafetta describes some idols which he saw in Cebu,\r\nand Chirino tells us that, within the memory of Filipinos whom he knew,\r\nthey had idols of stone, wood, bone, or the tooth of a crocodile,\r\nand that there were some of gold.\r\n\r\nThey also reverenced animals and birds, especially the crocodile,\r\nthe raven, and a mythical bird of blue or yellow color, which was\r\ncalled by the name of their deity Bathala. [19] They had no temples\r\nor public places of worship, but each one had his anitos in his own\r\nhouse and performed his sacrifices and acts of worship there. As\r\nsacrifices they killed pigs or chickens, and made such occasions\r\ntimes of feasting, song, and drunkenness. The life of the Filipino\r\nwas undoubtedly filled with superstitious fears and imaginings.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedan Malays.--The Mohammedans outside of southern Mindanao\r\nand Jolo, had settled in the vicinity of Manila Bay and on Mindoro,\r\nLubang, and adjacent coasts of Luzon. The spread of Mohammedanism\r\nwas stopped by the Spaniards, although it is narrated that for a\r\nlong time many of those living on the shores of Manila Bay refused to\r\neat pork, which is forbidden by the Koran, and practiced the rite of\r\ncircumcision. As late as 1583, Bishop Salazar, in writing to the king\r\nof affairs in the Philippines, says the Moros had preached the law\r\nof Mohammed to great numbers in these islands and by this preaching\r\nmany of the Gentiles had become Mohammedans; and further he adds,\r\n\"Those who have received this foul law guard it with much persistence\r\nand there is great difficulty in making them abandon it; and with\r\ncause too, for the reasons they give, to our shame and confusion,\r\nare that they were better treated by the preachers of Mohammed than\r\nthey have been by the preachers of Christ.\" [20]\r\n\r\nMaterial Progress of the Filipinos.--The material surroundings of\r\nthe Filipino before the arrival of the Spaniards were in nearly every\r\nway quite as they are to-day. The \"center of population\" of each town\r\nto-day, with its great church, tribunal, stores and houses of stone\r\nand wood, is certainly in marked contrast; but the appearance of a\r\nbarrio a little distance from the center is to-day probably much as it\r\nwas then. Then, as now, the bulk of the people lived in humble houses\r\nof bamboo and nipa raised on piles above the dampness of the soil;\r\nthen, as now, the food was largely rice and the excellent fish which\r\nabound in river and sea. There were on the water the same familiar\r\nbancas and fish corrals, and on land the rice fields and cocoanut\r\ngroves. The Filipinos had then most of the present domesticated\r\nanimals,--dogs, cats, goats, chickens, and pigs,--and perhaps in Luzon\r\nthe domesticated buffalo, although this animal was widely introduced\r\ninto the Philippines from China after the Spanish conquest. Horses came\r\nwith the Spaniards and their numbers were increased by the bringing\r\nin of Chinese mares, whose importation is frequently mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards introduced also the cultivation of tobacco, coffee,\r\nand cacao, and perhaps also the native corn of America, the maize,\r\nalthough Pigafetta says they found it already growing in the Bisayas.\r\n\r\nThe Filipino has been affected by these centuries of Spanish\r\nsovereignty far less on his material side than he has on his spiritual,\r\nand it is mainly in the deepening and elevating of his emotional and\r\nmental life and not in the bettering of his material condition that\r\nadvance has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH SOLDIER AND THE SPANISH MISSIONARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of the Philippines as a Part of the History of the Spanish\r\nColonies.--We have already seen how the Philippines were discovered by\r\nMagellan in his search for the Spice Islands. Brilliant and romantic\r\nas is the story of that voyage, it brought no immediate reward to\r\nSpain. Portugal remained in her enjoyment of the Eastern trade and\r\nnearly half a century elapsed before Spain obtained a settlement\r\nin these islands. But if for a time he neglected the Far East, the\r\nSpaniard from the Peninsula threw himself with almost incredible\r\nenergy and devotion into the material and spiritual conquest of\r\nAmerica. All the greatest achievements of the Spanish soldier and\r\nthe Spanish missionary had been secured within fifty years from the\r\nday when Columbus sighted the West Indies.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the history of the Philippines, we must not\r\nforget that these islands formed a part of this great colonial empire\r\nand were under the same administration; that for over two centuries\r\nthe Philippines were reached through Mexico and to a certain extent\r\ngoverned by Mexico; that the same governors, judges, and soldiers held\r\noffice in both hemispheres, passing from America to the Philippines\r\nand being promoted from the Islands to the higher official positions of\r\nMexico and Peru. So to understand the rule of Spain in the Philippines,\r\nwe must study the great administrative machinery and the great body\r\nof laws which she developed for the government of the Indies. [21]\r\n\r\nCharacter of the Spanish Explorers.--The conquests themselves\r\nwere largely effected through the enterprise and wealth of private\r\nindividuals; but these men held commissions from the Spanish crown,\r\ntheir actions were subject to strict royal control, and a large\r\nproportion of the profits and plunder of their expeditions were\r\npaid to the royal treasury. Upon some of these conquerors the crown\r\nbestowed the proud title of \"adelantado.\" The Spanish nobility threw\r\nthemselves into these hazardous undertakings with the courage and\r\nfixed determination born of their long struggle with the Moors. Out\r\nof the soul-trying circumstances of Western conquest many obscure men\r\nrose, through their brilliant qualities of spirit, to positions of\r\neminence and power; but the exalted offices of viceroy and governor\r\nwere reserved for the titled favorites of the king.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Audiencia.--Very early the Spanish court, in order\r\nto protect its own authority, found it necessary to succeed the\r\nambitious and adventurous conqueror by a ruler in close relationship\r\nwith and absolute dependence on the royal will. Thus in Mexico,\r\nCortes the conqueror was removed and replaced by the viceroy Mendoza,\r\nwho established upon the conquests of the former the great Spanish\r\ncolony of New Spain, to this day the most successful of all the states\r\nplanted by Spain in America.\r\n\r\nTo limit the power of the governor or viceroy, as well as to act as\r\na supreme court for the settlement of actions and legal questions,\r\nSpain created the \"Royal Audiencia.\" This was a body of men of noble\r\nrank and learned in the law, sent out from Spain to form in each\r\ncountry a colonial court; but their powers were not alone judicial;\r\nthey were also administrative. In the absence of the governor they\r\nassumed his duties.\r\n\r\nTreatment of the Natives by the Spanish.--In his treatment of\r\nthe natives, whose lands he captured, the Spanish king attempted\r\nthree things,--first, to secure to the colonist and to the crown\r\nthe advantages of his labor, second, to convert the Indians to the\r\nChristian religion as maintained by the Roman Catholic Church, and\r\nthird, to protect them from cruelty and inhumanity. Edict after\r\nedict, law after law, issued from the Spanish throne with these\r\nends in view. As they stand upon the greatest of colonial law-books,\r\nthe Recopilacion de Leyes de las Indias, they display an admirable\r\nsensitiveness to the needs of the Indian and an appreciation of the\r\ndangers to which he was subjected; but in the actual practice these\r\nbeneficent provisions were largely useless.\r\n\r\nThe first and third of Spain's purposes in her treatment of the native\r\nproved incompatible. History has shown that liberty and enlightenment\r\ncan not be taken from a race with one hand and protection given it\r\nwith the other. All classes of Spain's colonial government were\r\nfrankly in pursuit of wealth. Greed filled them all, and was the\r\nmainspring of every discovery and every settlement. The king wanted\r\nrevenue for his treasury; the noble and the soldier, booty for their\r\nprivate purse; the friar, wealth for his order; the bishop, power\r\nfor his church. All this wealth had to come out of the native toiler\r\non the lands which the Spanish conqueror had seized; and while noble\r\nmotives were probably never absent and at certain times prevailed,\r\nyet in the main the native of America and of the Philippines was a\r\nsufferer under the hand and power of the Spaniard.\r\n\r\n\"The Encomenderos.\"--Spain's system of controlling the lives and\r\nthe labor of the Indians was based to a certain extent on the feudal\r\nsystem, still surviving in the Peninsula at the time of her colonial\r\nconquests. The captains and soldiers and priests of her successful\r\nconquests had assigned to them great estates or fruitful lands with\r\ntheir native inhabitants, which they managed and ruled for their own\r\nprofit. Such estates were called first \"repartimientos.\" But very\r\nsoon it became the practice, in America, to grant large numbers of\r\nIndians to the service of a Spaniard, who had over them the power\r\nof a master and who enjoyed the profits of their labor. In return\r\nhe was supposed to provide for the conversion of the Indians and\r\ntheir religious instruction. Such a grant of Indians was called an\r\n\"encomienda.\" The \"encomendero\" was not absolute lord of the lives\r\nand properties of the Indians, for elaborate laws were framed for the\r\nlatter's protection. Yet the granting of subjects without the land\r\non which they lived made possible their transfer and sale from one\r\nencomendero to another, and in this way thousands of Indians of America\r\nwere made practically slaves, and were forced into labor in the mines.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, the whole system was attacked by the Dominican\r\npriest, Las Casas, a truly noble character in the history of American\r\ncolonization, and various efforts were made in America to limit the\r\nencomiendas and to prevent their introduction into Mexico and Peru;\r\nbut the great power of the encomendero in America, together with\r\nthe influence of the Church, which held extensive encomiendas, had\r\nbeen sufficient to extend the institution, even against Las Casas'\r\nimpassioned remonstrances. Its abolition in Mexico was decreed in\r\n1544, but \"commissioners representing the municipality of Mexico and\r\nthe religious orders were sent to Spain to ask the king to revoke at\r\nleast those parts of the 'New Laws' which threatened the interests\r\nof the settlers. By a royal decree of October 20, 1545, the desired\r\nrevocation was granted. This action filled the Spanish settlers with\r\njoy and the enslaved Indians with despair.\" [22]\r\n\r\nThus was the institution early established as a part of the colonial\r\nsystem and came with the conquerors to the Philippines.\r\n\r\nRestrictions on Colonization and Commerce.--For the management of all\r\ncolonial affairs the king created a great board, or bureau, known as\r\nthe \"Council of the Indies,\" which sat in Madrid and whose members\r\nwere among the highest officials of Spain. The Spanish government\r\nexercised the closest supervision over all colonial matters, and\r\ncolonization was never free. All persons, wares, and ships, passing\r\nfrom Spain to any of her colonial possessions, were obliged to pass\r\nthrough Seville, and this one port alone.\r\n\r\nThis wealthy ancient city, situated on the river Guadalquivir in\r\nsouthwestern Spain, was the gateway to the Spanish Empire. From this\r\nport went forth the mailed soldier, the robed friar, the adventurous\r\nnoble, and the brave and highborn Spanish ladies, who accompanied their\r\nhusbands to such great distances over the sea. And back to this port\r\nwere brought the gold of Peru, the silver of Mexico, and the silks\r\nand embroideries of China, dispatched through the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that all intercourse between Spain and her colonies\r\nwas rigidly controlled by the government. Spain sought to create and\r\nmaintain an exclusive monopoly of her colonial trade. To enforce and\r\ndirect this monopoly, there was at Seville the Commercial House, or\r\n\"Casa de Contratacion.\" No one could sail from Spain to a colonial\r\npossession without a permit and after government registration. No one\r\ncould send out goods or import them except through the Commercial House\r\nand upon the payment of extraordinary imposts. Trade was absolutely\r\nforbidden to any except Spaniards. And by her forts and fleets Spain\r\nstrove to isolate her colonies from the approach of Portuguese, Dutch,\r\nor English, whose ships, no less daringly manned than those of Spain\r\nherself, were beginning to traverse the seas in search of the plunder\r\nand spoils of foreign conquest and trade.\r\n\r\nSummary of the Colonial Policy of Spain.--Spain sought foreign\r\ncolonies, first, for the spoils of accumulated wealth that could be\r\nseized and carried away at once, and, secondly, for the income that\r\ncould be procured through the labor of the inhabitants of the lands she\r\ngained. In framing her government and administration of her colonies,\r\nshe sought primarily the political enlightenment and welfare neither\r\nof the Spanish colonist nor the native race, but the glory, power,\r\nand patronage of the crown. The commercial and trade regulations were\r\ndevised, not to develop the resources and increase the prosperity of\r\nthe colonies, but to add wealth to the Peninsula. Yet the purposes of\r\nSpain were far from being wholly selfish. With zeal and success she\r\nsought the conversion of the heathen natives, whom she subjected,\r\nand in this showed a humanitarian interest in advance of the Dutch\r\nand English, who rivaled her in colonial empire.\r\n\r\nThe colonial ideals under which the policy of Spain was framed were\r\nthose of the times. In the centuries that have succeeded, public wisdom\r\nand conscience on these matters have immeasurably improved. Nations no\r\nlonger make conquests frankly to exploit them, but the public opinion\r\nof the world demands that the welfare of the colonial subject be\r\nsought and that he be protected from official greed. There is great\r\nadvance still to be made. It can hardly be said that the world yet\r\nrecognizes that a stronger people should assist a weaker without\r\nassurance of material reward, but this is the direction in which\r\nthe most enlightened feeling is advancing. Every undertaking of the\r\nwhite race, which has such aims in view, is an experiment worthy of\r\nthe most profound interest and most solicitous sympathy.\r\n\r\nResult of the Voyage of Magellan and El Cano.--The mind of the\r\nSpanish adventurer was greatly excited by the results of Sebastian\r\ndel Cano's voyage. Here was the opportunity for rich trade and great\r\nprofit. Numerous plans were laid before the king, one of them for\r\nthe building of an Indian trading-fleet and an annual voyage to the\r\nMoluccas to gather a great harvest of spices.\r\n\r\nPortugal protested against this move until the question of her\r\nclaim to the Moluccas, under the division of Pope Alexander, could be\r\nsettled. The exact longitude of Ternate west from the line 370 leagues\r\nbeyond the Verde Islands was not well known. Spaniards argued that\r\nit was less than 180 degrees, and, therefore, in spite of Portugal's\r\nearlier discovery, belonged to them. The pilot, Medina, for example,\r\nexplained to Charles V. that from the meridian 370 leagues west of\r\nSan Anton (the most westerly island of the Verde group) to the city\r\nof Mexico was 59 degrees, from Mexico to Navidad, 9 degrees, and from\r\nthis port to Cebu, 100 degrees, a total of only 168 degrees, leaving\r\na margin of 12 degrees; therefore by the pope's decision the Indies,\r\nMoluccas, Borneo, Gilolo, and the Philippines were Spain's. [23]\r\nA great council of embassadors and cosmographers was held at Badajoz\r\nin 1524, but reached no agreement. Spain announced her resolution to\r\noccupy the Moluccas, and Portugal threatened with death the Spanish\r\nadventurers who should be found there.\r\n\r\nThe First Expedition to the Philippines.--Spain acted immediately\r\nupon her determination, and in 1525 dispatched an expedition under\r\nJofre de Loaisa to reap the fruits of Magellan's discoveries. [24]\r\nThe captain of one vessel was Sebastian del Cano, who completed the\r\nvoyage of Magellan. On his ship sailed Andres de Urdaneta, who later\r\nbecame an Augustinian friar and accompanied the expedition of Legaspi\r\nthat finally effected the settlement of the Philippines. Not without\r\ngreat hardship and losses did the fleet pass the Straits of Magellan\r\nand enter the Pacific Ocean. In mid-ocean Loaisa died, and four days\r\nlater the heroic Sebastian del Cano. Following a route somewhat similar\r\nto that of Magellan, the fleet reached first the Ladrone Islands and\r\nlater the coast of Mindanao. From here they attempted to sail to Cebu,\r\nbut the strong northeast monsoon drove them southward to the Moluccas,\r\nand they landed on Tidor the last day of the year 1526.\r\n\r\nThe Failure of the Expedition.--The Portuguese were at this\r\nmoment fighting to reduce the native rajas of these islands to\r\nsubjection. They regarded the Spaniards as enemies, and each party of\r\nEuropeans was shortly engaged in fighting and in inciting the natives\r\nagainst the other. The condition of the Spaniards became desperate\r\nin the extreme, and indicates at what cost of life the conquests of\r\nthe sixteenth century were made. Their ships had become so battered\r\nby storm as to be no longer sea-worthy. The two officers, who had\r\nsuccessively followed Loaisa and El Cano in command, had likewise\r\nperished. Of the 450 men who had sailed from Spain, but 120 now\r\nsurvived. These, under the leadership of Hernando de la Torre, threw\r\nup a fort on the island of Tidor, unable to go farther or to retire,\r\nand awaited hoped-for succor from Spain.\r\n\r\nRelief came, not from the Peninsula, but from Mexico. Under\r\nthe instructions of the Spanish king, in October, 1527, Cortes\r\ndispatched from Mexico a small expedition in charge of D. Alvaro de\r\nSaavedra. Swept rapidly by the equatorial trades, in a few months\r\nSaavedra had traversed the Carolines, reprovisioned on Mindanao,\r\nand reached the survivors on Tidor. Twice they attempted to return\r\nto New Spain, but strong trade winds blow without cessation north and\r\nsouth on either side of the equator for the space of more than twelve\r\nhundred miles, and the northern latitude of calms and prevailing\r\nwesterly winds were not yet known.\r\n\r\nTwice Saavedra beat his way eastward among the strange islands of\r\nPapua and Melanesia, only to be at last driven back upon Tidor and\r\nthere to die. The survivors were forced to abandon the Moluccas. By\r\nsurrendering to the Portuguese they were assisted to return to Europe\r\nby way of Malacca, Ceylon, and Africa, and they arrived at Lisbon\r\nin 1536, the survivors of Loaisa's expedition, having been gone from\r\nSpain eleven years.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Spanish crown to obtain possession of the Spice\r\nIslands, the Celebes and Moluccas, with their coveted products of\r\nnutmeg, cinnamon, and pepper, were for the time being ended. By the\r\nTreaty of Zaragoza (1529) the Emperor, Charles V., for the sum of\r\nthree hundred and fifty thousand gold ducats, renounced all claim\r\nto the Moluccas. For thirteen years the provisions of this treaty\r\nwere respected by the Spaniards, and then another attempt was made\r\nto obtain a foothold in the East Indies.\r\n\r\nThe Second Expedition to the Philippines.--The facts that disaster\r\nhad overwhelmed so many, that two oceans must be crossed, and that\r\nno sailing-route from Asia back to America was known, did not deter\r\nthe Spaniards from their perilous conquests; and in 1542 another\r\nexpedition sailed from Mexico, under command of Lopez de Villalobos,\r\nto explore the Philippines and if possible to reach China.\r\n\r\nAcross the Pacific they made a safe and pleasant voyage. In the\r\nwarm waters of the Pacific they sailed among those wonderful coral\r\natolls, rings of low shore, decked with palms, grouped in beautiful\r\narchipelagoes, whose appearance has never failed to delight the\r\nnavigator, and whose composition is one of the most interesting\r\nsubjects known to students of the earth's structure and history. Some\r\nof these coral islands Villalobos took possession of in the name of\r\nSpain. These were perhaps the Pelew Islands or the Carolines.\r\n\r\nAt last Villalobos reached the east coast of Mindanao, but after\r\nsome deaths and sickness they sailed again and were carried south by\r\nthe monsoon to the little island of Sarangani, south of the southern\r\npeninsula of Mindanao. The natives were hostile, but the Spaniards\r\ndrove them from their stronghold and made some captures of musk,\r\namber, oil, and gold-dust. In need of provisions, they planted the\r\nmaize, or Indian corn, the wonderful cereal of America, which yields\r\nso bounteously, and so soon after planting. Food was greatly needed\r\nby the Spaniards and was very difficult to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe Naming of the Islands.--Villalobos equipped a small vessel and\r\nsent it northward to try to reach Cebu. This vessel reached the\r\ncoast of Samar. Villalobos gave to the island the name of Filipina,\r\nin honor of the Spanish Infante, or heir apparent, Philip, who was\r\nsoon to succeed his father Charles V. as King Philip the Second of\r\nSpain. Later in his correspondence with the Portuguese Villalobos\r\nspeaks of the archipelago as Las Filipinas. Although for many years\r\nthe title of the Islas del Poniente continued in use, Villalobos'\r\nname of Filipinas gradually gained place and has lived.\r\n\r\nThe End of the Expedition.--While on Sarangani demands were made by\r\nthe Portuguese, who claimed that Mindanao belonged with the Celebes,\r\nthat the Spaniards should leave. Driven from Mindanao by lack of\r\nfood and hostility of the natives, Villalobos was blown southward\r\nby storms to Gilolo. Here, after long negotiations, the Portuguese\r\ncompelled him to surrender. The survivors of the expedition dispersed,\r\nsome remaining in the Indies, and some eventually reaching Spain;\r\nbut Villalobos, overwhelmed by discouragement, died on the island of\r\nAmboyna. The priest who ministered to him in his last hours was the\r\nfamous Jesuit missionary to the Indies, Saint Francis Xavier.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three years were to elapse after the sailing of Villalobos'\r\nfleet before another Spanish expedition should reach the\r\nPhilippines. The year 1565 dates the permanent occupation of the\r\narchipelago by the Spanish.\r\n\r\nIncrease in Political Power of the Church.--Under Philip the Second,\r\nthe champion of ecclesiasticism, the Spanish crown cemented the\r\nunion of the monarchy with the church and devoted the resources of\r\nthe empire, not only to colonial acquisition, but to combating the\r\nProtestant revolution on the one hand and heathenism on the other. The\r\nSpanish king effected so close a union of the church and state in\r\nSpain, that from this time on churchmen rose higher and higher in the\r\nSpanish councils, and profoundly influenced the policy and fate of\r\nthe nation. The policy of Philip the Second, however, brought upon\r\nSpain the revolt of the Dutch Lowlands and the wars with England,\r\nand her struggle with these two nations drained her resources both on\r\nland and sea, and occasioned a physical and moral decline. But while\r\nSpain was constantly losing power and prestige in Europe, the king\r\nwas extending his colonial domain, lending royal aid to the ambitious\r\nadventurer and to the ardent missionary friar. Spain's object being\r\nto christianize as well as to conquer, the missionary became a very\r\nimportant figure in the history of every colonial enterprise, and\r\nthese great orders to whom missions were intrusted thus became the\r\ncentral institutions in the history of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe Rise of Monasticism.--Monasticism was introduced into Europe from\r\nthe East at the very commencement of the Middle Ages. The fundamental\r\nidea of the old monasticism was retirement from human society in the\r\nbelief that the world was bad and could not be bettered, and that men\r\ncould lead holier lives and better please God by forsaking secular\r\nemployments and family relations, and devoting all their attention\r\nto purifying their characters. The first monastic order in Europe\r\nwere the Benedictines, organized in the seventh century, whose rule\r\nand organization were the pattern for those that followed.\r\n\r\nThe clergy of the church were divided thus into two groups,--first,\r\nthe parish priests, or ministers, who lived among the people over\r\nwhom they exercised the care of souls, and who, because they were of\r\nthe people themselves and lived their lives in association with the\r\ncommunity, were known as the \"secular clergy,\" and second, the monks,\r\nor \"regular clergy,\" were so called because they lived under the\r\n\"rule\" of their order.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the thirteenth century monasticism, which had\r\nwaned somewhat during the preceding two centuries, received a new\r\nimpetus and inspiration from the organization of new orders known\r\nas brethren or \"Friars.\" The idea underlying their organization was\r\nnoble, and above that of the old monasticism; for it was the idea of\r\nservice, of ministry both to the hearts and bodies of depressed and\r\nsuffering men.\r\n\r\nThe Dominicans.--The Order of Dominicans was organized by Saint\r\nDominic, an Italian, about 1215. The primary object of its members\r\nwas to defend the doctrines of the Church and, by teaching and\r\npreaching, destroy the doubts and protests which in the thirteenth\r\ncentury were beginning to disturb the claims of the Catholic Church\r\nand the Papacy. The Dominican friars did not live in communities, but\r\ntraveled about, humbly clad, preaching in the villages and towns, and\r\nseeking to expose and punish the heretic. The mediaeval universities,\r\nthrough their study of philosophy and the Roman law, were producing\r\na class of men disposed to hold opinions contrary to the teachings\r\nof the Church. The Dominicans realized the importance of these great\r\ncenters of instruction and entered them as teachers and masters, and\r\nby the beginning of the fifteenth century had made them strongholds\r\nof conservatism and orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans.--A few years after this organization, the Order of\r\nFranciscans was founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, of Spain. The aims\r\nof this order were not only to preach and administer the sacraments,\r\nbut to nurse the sick, provide for the destitute, and alleviate the\r\ndreadful misery which affected whole classes in the Middle Ages. They\r\ntook vows of absolute poverty, and so humble was the garb prescribed\r\nby their rule that they went barefooted from place to place.\r\n\r\nThe Augustinian Order was founded by Pope Alexander IV., in 1265,\r\nand still other orders came later.\r\n\r\nThe Degeneration of the Orders.--Without doubt the early ministrations\r\nof these friars were productive of great good both on the religious\r\nand humanitarian sides. But, as the orders became wealthy, the friars\r\nlost their spirituality and their lives grew vicious. By the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century the administration of the Church throughout\r\nEurope had become so corrupt, the economic burden of the religious\r\norders so great, and religious teaching and belief so material, that\r\nthe best and noblest minds in all countries were agitating for reform.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation.--In addition to changes in church administration,\r\nmany Christians were demanding a greater freedom of religious thinking\r\nand radical changes in the Church doctrine which had taken form in\r\nthe Middle Ages. Thus, while all the best minds in the Church were\r\nunited in seeking a reformation of character and of administration,\r\ngreat differences arose between them as to the possibility of change\r\nin Church doctrines. These differences accordingly separated them\r\ninto two parties, the Papacy adhering strongly to the doctrine as\r\nit was then accepted, while various leaders in the north of Europe,\r\nincluding Martin Luther in Germany, Swingli in Switzerland, and John\r\nCalvin in France and Geneva, broke with the authority of the Pope\r\nand declared for a liberation of the individual conscience.\r\n\r\nUpon the side of the Papacy, the Emperor Charles the Fifth threw the\r\nweight of the Spanish monarchy, and to enforce the Papal authority\r\nhe attacked the German princes by force of arms. The result was\r\na great revolt from the Roman Catholic Church, which spread all\r\nover northern Germany, a large portion of Switzerland, the lowlands\r\nof the Rhine, and England, and which included a numerous and very\r\ninfluential element among the French people. These countries, with\r\nthe exception of France, have remained Protestant to the present day;\r\nand the great expansion of the English people in America and the East\r\nhas established Protestantism in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nEffects of the Reformation in the Roman Catholic Church.--The reform\r\nmovement, which lasted through the century, brought about a great\r\nimprovement in the Roman Catholic Church. Many, who remained devoted\r\nto Roman Catholic orthodoxy, were zealous for administrative reform. A\r\ngreat assembly of Churchmen, the Council of Trent, for years devoted\r\nitself to legislation to correct abuses. The Inquisition was revived\r\nand put into force against Protestants, especially in the dominions\r\nof Spain, and the religious orders were reformed and stimulated to\r\nnew sacrifices and great undertakings.\r\n\r\nBut greater, perhaps, than any of these agencies in re-establishing\r\nthe power of the Pope and reviving the life of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch was the organization of a new order, the \"Society of Jesus.\" The\r\nfounder was a Spaniard, Ignatius Loyola, The Jesuits devoted themselves\r\nespecially to education and missionary activity. Their schools soon\r\ncovered Europe, while their mission stations were to be found in both\r\nNorth and South America, India, the East Indies, China, and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Missionary.--The Roman Catholic Church, having lost a large\r\npart of Europe, thus strove to make up the loss by gaining converts\r\nin heathen lands. Spain, being the power most rapidly advancing her\r\nconquests abroad, was the source of the most tireless missionary\r\neffort. From the time of Columbus, every fleet that sailed to gain\r\nplunder and lands for the Spanish kingdom carried bands of friars\r\nand churchmen to convert to Christianity the heathen peoples whom\r\nthe sword of the soldier should reduce to obedience.\r\n\r\n\"The Laws of the Indies\" gave special power and prominence to the\r\npriest. In these early days of Spain's colonial empire many priests\r\nwere men of piety, learning, and unselfish devotion. Their efforts\r\nsoftened somewhat the violence and brutality that often marred the\r\nSpanish treatment of the native, and they became the civilizing agents\r\namong the peoples whom the Spanish soldiers had conquered.\r\n\r\nIn Paraguay, California, and the Philippines the power and importance\r\nof the Spanish missionary outweighed that of the soldier or governor\r\nin the settlement of those countries and the control of the native\r\ninhabitants. Churchmen, full of the missionary spirit, pressed upon\r\nthe king the duties of the crown in advancing the cross, and more than\r\none country was opened to Spanish settlement through the enthusiasm\r\nof the priest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF CONQUEST AND SETTLEMENT, 1565-1600.\r\n\r\n\r\nCause of Settlement and Conquest of the Philippines.--The previous\r\nSpanish expeditions whose misfortunes have been narrated, seemed\r\nto have proved to the Court of Spain that they could not drive the\r\nPortuguese from the Moluccas. But to the east of the Moluccas lay\r\ngreat unexplored archipelagoes, which might lie within the Spanish\r\ndemarcation and which might yield spices and other valuable articles\r\nof trade; and as the Portuguese had made no effective occupation of\r\nthe Philippines, the minds of Spanish conquerors turned to this group\r\nalso as a coveted field of conquest, even though it was pretty well\r\nunderstood that they lay in the latitude of the Moluccas, and so were\r\ndenied by treaty to Spain.\r\n\r\nIn 1559 the Spanish king, Felipe II., commanded the viceroy of Mexico\r\nto undertake again the discovery of the islands lying \"toward the\r\nMoluccas,\" but the rights of Portugal to islands within her demarcation\r\nwere to be respected. Five years passed before ships and equipments\r\ncould be prepared, and during these years the objects of the expedition\r\nreceived considerable discussion and underwent some change.\r\n\r\nThe king invited Andres de Urdaneta, who years before had been a\r\ncaptain in the expedition of Loaisa, to accompany the expedition as\r\na guide and director. Urdaneta, after his return from the previous\r\nexpedition, had renounced military life and had become an Augustinian\r\nfriar. He was known to be a man of wise judgment, with good knowledge\r\nof cosmography, and as a missionary he was able to give to the\r\nexpedition that religious strength which characterized all Spanish\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\nIt was Urdaneta's plan to colonize, not the Philippines, but New\r\nGuinea; but the Audiencia of Mexico, which had charge of fitting\r\nout the expedition, charged it in minute instructions to reach\r\nand if possible colonize the Philippines, to trade for spices\r\nand to discover the return sailing route back across the Pacific\r\nto New Spain. The natives of the islands were to be converted to\r\nChristianity, and missionaries were to accompany the expedition. In\r\nthe quaint language of Fray Gaspar de San Augustin, there were sent\r\n\"holy guides to unfurl and wave the banners of Christ, even to the\r\nremotest portions of the islands, and to drive the devil from the\r\ntyrannical possession, which he had held for so many ages, usurping\r\nto himself the adoration of those peoples.\" [25]\r\n\r\nThe Third Expedition to the Philippines.--The expedition sailed from\r\nthe port of Natividad, Mexico, November 21, 1564, under the command\r\nof Miguel Lopez de Legaspi. The ships followed for a part of the\r\nway a course further south than was necessary, and touched at some\r\ninhabited islands of Micronesia. About the 22d of January they reached\r\nthe Ladrones and had some trouble with the natives. They reached the\r\nsouthern end of Samar about February the 13th. Possession of Samar\r\nwas taken by Legaspi in the name of the king, and small parties were\r\nsent both north and south to look for villages of the Filipinos.\r\n\r\nA few days later they rounded the southern part of Samar, crossed the\r\nstrait to the coast of southern Leyte, and the field-marshal, Goyti,\r\ndiscovered the town of Cabalian, and on the 5th of March the fleet\r\nsailed to this town. Provisions were scarce on the Spanish vessels,\r\nand great difficulty was experienced in getting food from the few\r\nnatives met in boats or in the small settlements discovered.\r\n\r\nLegaspi at Bohol.--About the middle of March the fleet arrived at\r\nBohol, doubtless the southern or eastern shore. While near here Goyti\r\nin a small boat captured a Moro prao from Borneo and after a hard\r\nfight brought back the Moros as prisoners to Legaspi. There proved\r\nto be quite a trade existing between the Moros from Borneo and the\r\nnatives of Bohol and Mindanao.\r\n\r\nHere on Bohol they were able to make friendly terms with the natives,\r\nand with Sicatuna, the dato of Bohol, Legaspi performed the ceremony\r\nof blood covenant. The Spanish leader and the Filipino chief each\r\nmade a small cut in his own arm or breast and drank the blood of the\r\nother. According to Gaspar de San Augustin, the blood was mixed with\r\na little wine or water and drunk from a goblet. [26] This custom was\r\nthe most sacred bond of friendship among the Filipinos, and friendship\r\nso pledged was usually kept with great fidelity.\r\n\r\nLegaspi in Cebu.--On the 27th of April, 1565, Legaspi's fleet reached\r\nCebu. Here, in this beautiful strait and fine anchoring-ground,\r\nMagellan's ships had lingered until the death of their leader\r\nforty-four years before. A splendid native settlement lined the\r\nshore, so Father Chirino tells us, for a distance of more than a\r\nleague. The natives of Cebu were fearful and greatly agitated, and\r\nseemed determined to resist the landing of the Spaniards. But at the\r\nfirst discharge of the guns of the ships, the natives abandoned the\r\nshore, and, setting fire to the town, retreated into the jungles and\r\nhills. Without loss of life the Spaniards landed, and occupied the\r\nharbor and town.\r\n\r\nFinding of \"the Holy Child of Cebu.\"--The Spanish soldiers found in\r\none of the houses of the natives a small wooden image of the Child\r\nJesus. A similar image, Pigafetta tells us, he had himself given to\r\na native while in the island with Magellan. It had been preserved by\r\nthe natives and was regarded by them as an object of veneration. To\r\nthe pious Spaniards the discovery of this sacred object was hailed\r\nas an event of great good fortune. It was taken by the monks, and\r\ncarried to a shrine especially erected for it. It still rests in the\r\nchurch of the Augustinians, an object of great devotion.\r\n\r\nSettlement Made at Cebu.--In honor of this image this first settlement\r\nof the Spaniards in the Philippines received the name of \"City of\r\nthe Most Holy Name of Jesus.\" Here Legaspi established himself, and,\r\nby great tact and skill, gradually won the confidence and friendship\r\nof the inhabitants. A formal peace was at last concluded in which the\r\ndato, Tupas, recognized the sovereignty of Spain; and the people of\r\nCebu and the Spaniards bound themselves to assist each other against\r\nthe enemies of either.\r\n\r\nThey had some difficulty in understanding one another, but the\r\nSpaniards had with them a Mohammedan Malay of Borneo, called Cid-Hamal,\r\nwho had been taken from the East Indies to the Peninsula and thence\r\nto Mexico and Legaspi's expedition. The languages of Malaysia and\r\nthe Philippines are so closely related that this man was able to\r\ninterpret. Almost immediately, however, the missionaries began the\r\nstudy of the native dialect, and Padre Chirino tells us that Friar\r\nMartin Herrada made here the first Filipino vocabulary, and was soon\r\npreaching the Gospel to the natives in their own language.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty experienced by Legaspi was to procure sufficient\r\nfood for his expedition. At different times he sent a ship to the\r\nnearest islands, and twice his ship went south to Mindanao to procure\r\na cargo of cinnamon to be sent back to New Spain.\r\n\r\nThus month by month the Spaniards gained acquaintance with the\r\nbeautiful island sea of the archipelago, with its green islands\r\nand brilliant sheets of water, its safe harbors and picturesque\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nThe Bisayans.--In 1569, Legaspi discovered the great island of\r\nPanay. Here they were fortunate in securing a great abundance\r\nof supplies and the friendship of the natives, who received them\r\nwell. These beautiful central islands of the Philippines are inhabited\r\nby Bisaya. The Spaniards found this tribe tattooing their bodies\r\nwith ornamental designs, a practice widespread throughout Oceanica,\r\nand which still is common among the tribes of northern Luzon. This\r\npractice caused the Spaniards to give to the Bisayas the title of\r\n\"Islas de los Pintados\" (the Islands of the Painted).\r\n\r\nDiscovery of the Northern Return Route across the Pacific.--Before\r\nthe arrival of the expedition in the Philippines, the captain of one\r\nof Legaspi's ships, inspired by ungenerous ambition and the hopes\r\nof getting a reward, outsailed the rest of the fleet. Having arrived\r\nfirst in the islands, he started at once upon the return voyage. Unlike\r\npreceding captains who had tried to return to New Spain by sailing\r\neastward from the islands against both wind and ocean current, this\r\ncaptain sailed northward beyond the trades into the more favorable\r\nwesterly winds, and found his way back to America and New Spain.\r\n\r\nSoon after arriving in the Philippines, Legaspi's instructions\r\nrequired him to dispatch at least one vessel on the return voyage to\r\nNew Spain. Accordingly on June 1st the San Pablo set sail, carrying\r\nabout two hundred men, including Urdenata and another friar. This\r\nvessel also followed the northern route across the Pacific, and\r\nafter a voyage of great hardship, occupying three and a half months,\r\nit reached the coast of North America at California and followed it\r\nsouthward to Acapulco.\r\n\r\nThe discovery made by these captains of a favorable route for vessels\r\nreturning from the islands to New Spain safe from capture by the\r\nPortuguese, completed the plans of the Spanish for the occupation\r\nof the Philippines. In 1567 another vessel was dispatched by Legaspi\r\nand made this voyage successfully.\r\n\r\nThe sailing of these vessels left Legaspi in Cebu with a colony\r\nof only one hundred and fifty Spaniards, poorly provided with\r\nresources, to commence the conquest of the Philippines. But he won the\r\nfriendship and respect of the inhabitants, and in 1568 two galleons\r\nwith reinforcements arrived from Acapulco. From this time on nearly\r\nyearly communication was maintained, fresh troops with munitions and\r\nsupplies arriving with each expedition.\r\n\r\nThe First Expedition against the Moro Pirates.--Pirates of\r\nMindoro.--The Spaniards found the Straits of San Bernardino and the\r\nMindoro Sea swarming with the fleets of Mohammedan Malays from Borneo\r\nand the Jolo Archipelago. To a race living so continuously upon the\r\nwater, piracy has always possessed irresistible attractions. In the\r\ndays of Legaspi, the island of Mindoro had been partially settled by\r\nMalays from the south, and many of these settlements were devoted\r\nto piracy, preying especially upon the towns on the north coast of\r\nPanay. In January, 1570, Legaspi dispatched his grandson, Juan de\r\nSalcedo, to punish these marauders. [27]\r\n\r\nCapture of Pirate Strongholds.--Salcedo had a force of forty Spaniards\r\nand a large number of Bisaya. He landed on the western coast of\r\nMindoro and took the pirate town of Mamburao. The main stronghold of\r\nthe Moros he found to be on the small island of Lubang, northwest of\r\nMindanao. Here they had three strong forts with high walls, on which\r\nwere mounted small brass cannon, or \"lantakas.\" Two of these forts\r\nwere surrounded by moats. There were several days of fighting before\r\nLubang was conquered. The possession of Lubang brought the Spaniards\r\nalmost to the entrance of Manila Bay, Meanwhile, a captain, Enriquez\r\nde Guzman, had discovered Masbate, Burias, and Ticao, and had landed\r\non Luzon in the neighborhood of Albay, called then, \"Italon.\"\r\n\r\nConquest of the Moro City of Manila.--Expedition from Panay.--Reports\r\nhad come to Legaspi of an important Mohammedan settlement named\r\n\"May-nila,\" on the shore of a great bay, and a Mohammedan chieftain,\r\ncalled Maomat, was procured to guide the Spaniards on their conquest\r\nof this region. [28] For this purpose Legaspi sent his field-marshal,\r\nMartin de Goiti, with Salcedo, one hundred and twenty Spanish soldiers,\r\nand fourteen or fifteen boats filled with Bisayan allies. They left\r\nPanay early in May, and, after stopping at Mindoro, came to anchor\r\nin Manila Bay, off the mouth of the Pasig River.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedan City.--On the south bank of the river was the fortified\r\ntown of the Mohammedan chieftain, Raja Soliman; on the north bank was\r\nthe town of Tondo, under the Raja Alcandora, or Lacandola. Morga [29]\r\ntells us that these Mohammedan settlers from the island of Borneo had\r\ncommenced to arrive on the island only a few years before the coming\r\nof the Spaniards. They had settled and married among the Filipino\r\npopulation already occupying Manila Bay, and had introduced some of the\r\nforms and practices of the Mohammedan religion. The city of Manila was\r\ndefended by a fort, apparently on the exact sight of the present fort\r\nof Santiago. It was built of the trunks of palms, and had embrasures\r\nwhere were mounted a considerable number of cannon, or lantakas.\r\n\r\nCapture of the City.--The natives received the foreigners at first\r\nwith a show of friendliness, but after they had landed on the banks of\r\nthe Pasig, Soliman, with a large force, assaulted them. The impetuous\r\nSpaniards charged, and carried the fortifications, and the natives\r\nfled, setting fire to their settlement. When the fight was over the\r\nSpaniards found among the dead the body of a Portuguese artillerist,\r\nwho had directed the defense. Doubtless he was one who had deserted\r\nfrom the Portuguese garrison far south in the Indian archipelago\r\nto cast in his fortunes with the Malays. It being the commencement\r\nof the season of rains and typhoons, the Spaniards decided to defer\r\nthe occupation of Manila, and, after exploring Cavite harbor, they\r\nreturned to Panay.\r\n\r\nA year was spent in strengthening their hold on the Bisayas and in\r\narranging for their conquest of Luzon. On Masbate was placed a friar\r\nand six soldiers, so small was the number that could be spared.\r\n\r\nFounding of the Spanish City of Manila.--With a force of 280 men\r\nLegaspi returned in the spring of 1571 to the conquest of Luzon. It was\r\na bloodless victory. The Filipino rajas declared themselves vassals\r\nof the Spanish king, and in the months of May and June the Spaniards\r\nestablished themselves in the present site of the city.\r\n\r\nAt once Legaspi gave orders for the reconstruction of the fort, the\r\nbuilding of a palace, a convent for the Augustinian monks, a church,\r\nand 150 houses. The boundaries of this city followed closely the\r\noutlines of the Tagalog city \"Maynila,\" and it seems probable that the\r\nlocation of buildings then established have been adhered to until the\r\npresent time. This settlement appeared so desirable to Legaspi that\r\nhe at once designated it as the capital of the archipelago. Almost\r\nimmediately he organized its governing assembly, or ayuntamiento.\r\n\r\nThe First Battle on Manila Bay.--In spite of their ready submission,\r\nthe rajas, Soliman and Lacandola, did not yield their sovereignty\r\nwithout a struggle. They were able to secure assistance in the Tagalog\r\nand Pampanga settlements of Macabebe and Hagonoy. A great fleet of\r\nforty war-praos gathered in palm-lined estuaries on the north shore\r\nof Manila Bay, and came sweeping down the shallow coast to drive the\r\nSpaniards from the island. Against them were sent Goiti and fifty\r\nmen. The protective mail armor, the heavy swords and lances, the\r\nhorrible firearms, coupled with the persistent courage and fierce\r\nresolution of the Spanish soldier of the sixteenth century, swept\r\nback this native armament. The chieftain Soliman was killed.\r\n\r\nThe Conquest of Central Luzon.--Goiti continued his marching and\r\nconquering northward until nearly the whole great plain of central\r\nLuzon, that stretches from Manila Bay to the Gulf of Lingayen,\r\nlay submissive before him. A little later the raja Lacandola died,\r\nhaving accepted Christian baptism, and the only powerful resistance\r\non the island of Luzon was ended.\r\n\r\nGoiti was sent back to the Bisayas, and the command of the army of\r\nLuzon fell to Salcedo, the brilliant and daring grandson of Legaspi,\r\nat this time only twenty-two years of age. This young knight led\r\nhis command up the Pasig River. Cainta and Taytay, at that time\r\nimportant Tagalog towns, were conquered, and then the country south\r\nof Laguna de Bay. The town of Cainta was fortified and defended by\r\nsmall cannon, and although Salcedo spent three days in negotiations,\r\nit was only taken by storm, in which four hundred Filipino men and\r\nwomen perished. [30] From here Salcedo marched over the mountains to\r\nthe Pacific coast and south into the Camarines, where he discovered\r\nthe gold mines of Paracale and Mamburao.\r\n\r\nAt about this time the Spaniards conquered the Cuyos and Calamianes\r\nislands and the northern part of Paragua.\r\n\r\nExploration of the Coast of Northern Luzon.--In 1572, Salcedo, with a\r\nforce of only forty-five men, sailed northward from Manila, landed in\r\nZambales and Pangasinan, and on the long and rich Ilocos coast effected\r\na permanent submission of the inhabitants. He also visited the coast\r\nfarther north, where the great and fertile valley of the Cagayan,\r\nthe largest river of the archipelago, reaches to the sea. From here he\r\ncontinued his adventurous journey down the Pacific coast of Luzon to\r\nthe island of Polillo, and returned by way of Laguna de Bay to Manila.\r\n\r\nDeath of Legaspi.--He arrived in September, 1572, to find that his\r\ngrandfather and commander, Legaspi, had died a month before (August 20,\r\n1572). After seven years of labor the conqueror of difficulties was\r\ndead, but almost the entire archipelago had been added to the crown\r\nof Spain. Three hundred years of Spanish dominion secured little\r\nmore territory than that traversed and pacified by the conquerors\r\nof those early years. In spite of their slender forces, the daring\r\nof the Spaniards induced them to follow a policy of widely extending\r\ntheir power, effecting settlements, and enforcing submission wherever\r\nrich coasts and the gathering of population attracted them.\r\n\r\nWithin a single year's time most of the coast country of Luzon had\r\nbeen traversed, important positions seized, and the inhabitants\r\nportioned out in encomiendas. On the death of Legaspi, the command\r\nfell to Guido de Lavezares.\r\n\r\nReasons for this Easy Conquest of the Philippines.--The explanation of\r\nhow so small a number of Europeans could so rapidly and successfully\r\nreduce to subjection the inhabitants of a territory like the\r\nPhilippines, separated into so many different islands, is to be found\r\nin several things.\r\n\r\nFirst.--The expedition had a great leader, one of those knights\r\ncombining sagacity with resolution, who glorify the brief period when\r\nSpanish prestige was highest. No policy could ever be successful in the\r\nPhilippines which did not depend for its strength upon giving a measure\r\nof satisfaction to the Filipino people. Legaspi did this. He appears\r\nto have won the native datos, treating them with consideration, and\r\nholding out to them the expectations of a better and more prosperous\r\nera, which the sovereignty of the Spaniard would bring. Almost from\r\nthe beginning, the natives of an island already reduced flocked to\r\nhis standard to assist in the conquest of another. The small forces\r\nof the Spanish soldiers were augmented by hundreds of Filipino allies.\r\n\r\nSecond.--Another reason is found in the wonderful courage and great\r\nfighting power of the Spanish soldier. Each man, splendidly armored\r\nand weaponed, deadly with either sword or spear, carrying in addition\r\nthe arquebus, the most efficient firearm of the time, was equal in\r\ncombat to many natives who might press upon him with their naked\r\nbodies and inferior weapons.\r\n\r\nThird.--Legaspi was extremely fortunate in his captains, who included\r\nsuch old campaigners as the field-marshal Martin de Goiti, who had\r\nbeen to the Philippines before with Villalobos, and such gallant\r\nyouths as Salcedo, one of the most attractive military figures in\r\nall Spanish history.\r\n\r\nFourth.--In considering this Spanish conquest, we must understand\r\nthat the islands were far more sparsely inhabited than they are\r\nto-day. The Bisayan islands, the rich Camarines, the island of Luzon,\r\nhad, in Legaspi's time, only a small fraction of their present great\r\npopulations. This population was not only small, but it was also\r\nextremely disunited. Not only were the great tribes separated by\r\nthe differences of language, but, as we have already seen, each tiny\r\ncommunity was practically independent, and the power of a dato very\r\nlimited. There were no great princes, with large forces of fighting\r\nretainers whom they could call to arms, such as the Portuguese had\r\nencountered among the Malays south in the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nFifth.--But certainly one of the greatest factors in the yielding\r\nof the Filipino to the Spaniard was the preaching of the missionary\r\nfriars. No man is so strong with an unenlightened and barbarous race as\r\nhe who claims power from God. And the preaching of the Catholic faith,\r\nwith its impressive and dramatic services, its holy sacraments, its\r\npower to arrest the attention and to admit at once the rude mind into\r\nthe circle of its ministry, won the heart of the Filipino. Without\r\ndoubt he was ready and eager for a loftier and truer religious belief\r\nand ceremonial. There was no powerful native priesthood to oppose\r\nthe introduction of Christianity. The preaching of the faith and the\r\nbaptism of converts proceeded almost as rapidly as the marching of\r\nSalcedo's soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Dangers of the Spanish Occupation.--Such conditions assured the\r\nsuccess of the Spanish occupation, provided the small colony could\r\nbe protected from outside attacks. But even from the beginning the\r\nposition of this little band of conquerors was perilous. Their numbers\r\nwere small and of necessity much scattered, and their only source\r\nof succor lay thousands of miles away, across the greatest body of\r\nwater on the earth, in a land itself a colony newly wrested from\r\nthe hand of the Indian. Across the narrow waters of the China Sea,\r\nonly a few days' distant, even in the slow-sailing junks, lay the\r\nteeming shores of the most populous country in the world, in those\r\ndays not averse to foreign conquest.\r\n\r\nAttempt of the Chinese under Limahong to Capture Manila.--Activity of\r\nthe Southern Chinese.--It was from the Chinese that the first heavy\r\nblow fell. The southeastern coast of China, comprising the provinces of\r\nKwangtung and Fukien, has always exhibited a restlessness and passion\r\nfor emigration not displayed by other parts of the country. From these\r\ntwo provinces, through the ports of Amoy and Canton, have gone those\r\nChinese traders and coolies to be found in every part of the East\r\nand many other countries of the world. Two hundred years before the\r\narrival of the Spaniards, Chinese junks traversed the straits and\r\nseas and visited regularly the coast of Mindanao.\r\n\r\nLimahong's Expedition to the Philippines.--This coast of China has\r\nalways been notorious for its piracy. The distance of the capital at\r\nPeking and the weakness of the provincial viceroys have made impossible\r\nits suppression. It was one of these bold filibusters of the China Sea,\r\ncalled Limahong, who two years after the death of Legaspi attempted\r\nthe conquest of the Philippines. The stronghold of this corsair was the\r\nisland of Pehon, where he fortified himself and developed his power.\r\n\r\nHere, reports of the prosperous condition of Manila reached him,\r\nand he prepared a fleet of sixty-two war-junks, with four thousand\r\nsoldiers and sailors. The accounts even state that a large number of\r\nwomen and artisans were taken on board to form the nucleus of the\r\nsettlement, as soon as the Spaniards should be destroyed. In the\r\nlatter part of November, 1574, this powerful fleet came sweeping\r\ndown the western coast of Luzon and on the 29th gathered in the\r\nlittle harbor of Mariveles, at the entrance to Manila Bay. Eight\r\nmiles south of Manila is the town of Paranaque, on an estuary which\r\naffords a good landing-place for boats entering from the bay. Here\r\non the night following, Limahong put ashore six hundred men, under\r\none of his generals, Sioco, who was a Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe Attack upon Manila.--From here they marched rapidly up the beach\r\nand fell furiously upon the city. Almost their first victim was the\r\nfield-marshal Goiti. The fort of Manila was at this date a weak affair,\r\nwithout ditches or escarpment, and it was here that the struggle took\r\nplace. The Spaniards, although greatly outnumbered, were able to\r\ndrive back the Chinese; but they themselves lost heavily. Limahong\r\nnow sent ashore heavy reinforcements, and prepared to overwhelm the\r\ngarrison. The Spaniards were saved from defeat by the timely arrival\r\nof Salcedo with fifty musketeers. From his station at Vigan he had\r\nseen the sails of Limahong's fleet, cruising southward along the Luzon\r\ncoast, and, suspecting that so great an expedition could have no other\r\npurpose than the capture of Manila, he embarked in seven small boats,\r\nand reached the city in six days, just in time to participate in the\r\nfurious battle between the Spaniards and the entire forces of the\r\nChinese pirate. The result was the complete defeat of the Chinese,\r\nwho were driven back upon their boats at Paranaque.\r\n\r\nThe Result of Limahong's Expedition.--Although defeated in his attack\r\non Manila, Limahong was yet determined on a settlement in Luzon, and,\r\nsailing northward, he landed in Pangasinan and began constructing\r\nfortifications at the mouth of the river Lingayen. The Spaniards\r\ndid not wait for him to strengthen himself and to dispute with them\r\nafresh for the possession of the island, but organized in March an\r\nexpedition of two hundred and fifty Spaniards and fifteen hundred\r\nFilipinos under Salcedo. They landed suddenly in the Gulf of Lingayen,\r\nburned the entire fleet of the Chinese, and scattered a part of the\r\nforces in the surrounding mountains. The rest, though hemmed in by\r\nthe Spaniards, were able to construct small boats, in which they\r\nescaped from the islands.\r\n\r\nThus ended this formidable attack, which threatened for a time to\r\noverthrow the power of Spain in the East. It was the beginning,\r\nhowever, of important relations with China. Before Limahong's escape\r\na junk arrived from the viceroy of Fukien, petitioning for the\r\ndelivery of the Chinese pirate. Two Augustinian friars accompanied\r\nhis junk back to China, eager for such great fields of missionary\r\nconquest. They carried letters from Lavezares inviting Chinese\r\nfriendship and intercourse.\r\n\r\nBeginning of a New Period of Conquest.--In the spring of 1576, Salcedo\r\ndied at Vigan, at the age of twenty-seven. With his death may be said\r\nto close the first period of the history in the Philippines,--that of\r\nthe Conquest, extending from 1565 to 1576. For the next twenty-five\r\nyears the ambitions of the Spaniards were not content with the\r\nexploration of this archipelago, but there were greater and more\r\nstriking conquests, to which the minds of both soldier and priest\r\naspired.\r\n\r\nDespite the settlement with Portugal, the rich Spice Islands to the\r\nsouth still attracted them, and there were soon revealed the fertile\r\ncoasts of Siam and Cambodia, the great empire of China, the beautiful\r\nisland of Formosa, and the Japanese archipelago. These, with their\r\ngreat populations and wealth, were more alluring fields than the poor\r\nand sparsely populated coasts of the Philippines. So, for the next\r\nquarter of a century, the policy of the Spaniards in the Philippines\r\nwas not so much to develop these islands themselves, as to make them\r\na center for the commercial and spiritual conquest of the Orient. [31]\r\n\r\nA Treaty with the Chinese.--The new governor arrived in the Islands\r\nin August, 1575. He was Dr. Francisco La-Sande. In October there\r\nreturned the ambassadors who had been sent to China by Lavezares. The\r\nviceroy of Fukien had received them with much ceremony. He had not\r\npermitted the friars to remain, but had forwarded the governor's\r\nletter to the Chinese emperor. In February following came a Chinese\r\nembassy, granting a port of the empire with which the Spaniards could\r\ntrade. This port, probably, was Amoy, which continued to be the chief\r\nport of communication with China to the present day.\r\n\r\nIt was undoubtedly commerce and not the missionaries that the Chinese\r\ndesired. Two Augustinians attempted to return with this embassy to\r\nChina, but the Chinese on leaving the harbor of Manila landed on\r\nthe coast of Zambales, where they whipped the missionaries, killed\r\ntheir servants and interpreter, and left the friars bound to trees,\r\nwhence they were rescued by a small party of Spaniards who happened\r\nto pass that way.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Drake's Noted Voyage.--The year 1577 is notable for the\r\nappearance in the East of the great English sea-captain, freebooter,\r\nand naval hero, Francis Drake. England and Spain, at this moment, while\r\nnot actually at war, were rapidly approaching the conflict which made\r\nthem for centuries traditional enemies. Spain was the champion of Roman\r\necclesiasticism. Her king, Philip the Second, was not only a cruel\r\nbigot, but a politician of sweeping ambition. His schemes included the\r\nconquest of France and England, the extermination of Protestantism,\r\nand the subjection of Europe to his own and the Roman authority.\r\n\r\nThe English people scented the danger from afar, and while the two\r\ncourts nominally maintained peace, the daring seamen of British Devon\r\nwere quietly putting to sea in their swift and terrible vessels,\r\nfor the crippling of the Spanish power. The history of naval warfare\r\nrecords no more reckless adventures than those of the English mariners\r\nduring this period. Audacity could not rise higher.\r\n\r\nDrake's is the most famous and romantic figure of them all. In the\r\nyear 1577, he sailed from England with the avowed purpose of sweeping\r\nthe Spanish Main. He passed the Straits of Magellan, and came up the\r\nwestern coast of South America, despoiling the Spanish shipping from\r\nValparaiso to Panama. Thence he came on across the Pacific, touched\r\nthe coast of Mindanao, and turned south to the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese had nominally annexed the Moluccas in 1522, but at\r\nthe time of Drake's visit they had been driven from Ternate, though\r\nstill holding Tidor. Drake entered into friendly relations with the\r\nsultan of Ternate, and secured a cargo of cloves. From here he sailed\r\nboldly homeward, daring the Portuguese fleets, as he had defied the\r\nSpanish, and by way of Good Hope returned to England, his fleet the\r\nfirst after Magellan's to circumnavigate the globe.\r\n\r\nA Spanish Expedition to Borneo.--The appearance of Drake in the\r\nMoluccas roused La-Sande to ambitious action. The attraction of\r\nthe southern archipelagoes was overpowering, and at this moment the\r\nopportunity seemed to open to the governor to force southward his\r\npower. One of the Malay kings of Borneo, Sirela, arrived in Manila,\r\npetitioning aid against his brother, and promising to acknowledge the\r\nsovereignty of the king of Spain over the island of Borneo. La-Sande\r\nwent in person to restore this chieftain to power. He had a fleet of\r\ngalleys and frigates, and, according to Padre Gaspar de San Augustin,\r\nmore than fifteen hundred Filipino bowmen from Pangasinan, Cagayan,\r\nand the Bisayas accompanied the expedition. He landed on the coast\r\nof Borneo, destroyed the fleet of praos and the city of the usurper,\r\nand endeavored to secure Sirela in his principality. Sickness among\r\nhis fleet and the lack of provisions forced him to return to Manila.\r\n\r\nThe First Attack upon the Moros of Jolo.--On his return he sent an\r\nofficer against the island of Jolo. This officer forced the Joloanos\r\nto recognize his power, and from there he passed to the island of\r\nMindanao, where he further enforced obedience upon the natives. This\r\nwas the beginning of the Spanish expeditions against the Moros, which\r\nhad the effect of arousing in these Mohammedan pirates such terrible\r\nretaliatory vengeance. Under La-Sande the conquest of the Camarines was\r\ncompleted by Captain Juan Chaves and the city of Nueva Caceres founded.\r\n\r\nThe Appointment of Governor Ronquillo.--It was the uniform policy of\r\nthe Spanish government to limit the term of office of the governor\r\nto a short period of years. This was one of the futile provisions by\r\nwhich Spain attempted to control both the ambition and the avarice\r\nof her colonial captains. But Don Gonzalo Ronquillo had granted to\r\nhim the governorship of the Philippines for life, on the condition of\r\nhis raising and equipping a force of six hundred in Spain, largely at\r\nhis own expense, for the better protection and pacification of the\r\narchipelago. This Ronquillo did, bringing his expedition by way of\r\nPanama. He arrived in April, 1580, and although he died at the end\r\nof three years, his rule came at an important time.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish and the Portuguese Colonies Combined.--In 1580, Philip\r\nII, conquered and annexed to Spain the kingdom of Portugal, and with\r\nPortugal came necessarily to the Spanish crown those rich eastern\r\ncolonies which the valor of Da Gama and Albuquerque had won. Portugal\r\nrewon her independence in 1640, but for years Manila was the capital\r\nof a colonial empire, extending from Goa in India to Formosa.\r\n\r\nEvents of Ronquillo's Rule.--Ronquillo, under orders from the crown,\r\nentered into correspondence with the captain of the Portuguese\r\nfortress on the island of Tidor, and the captain of Tidor petitioned\r\nRonquillo for assistance in reconquering the tempting island of\r\nTernate. Ronquillo sent south a considerable expedition, but after\r\narriving in the Moluccas the disease of beri-beri in the Spanish\r\ncamp defeated the undertaking. Ronquillo also sent a small armada to\r\nthe coasts of Borneo and Malacca, where a limited amount of pepper\r\nwas obtained.\r\n\r\nThe few years of Ronquillo's reign were in other ways important. A\r\ncolony of Spaniards was established at Oton, on the island of Panay,\r\nwhich was given the name of Arevalo (Iloilo). And under Ronquillo\r\nwas pacified for the first time the great valley of the Cagayan. At\r\nthe mouth of the river a Japanese adventurer, Tayfusa, or Tayzufu,\r\nhad established himself and was attempting the subjugation of this\r\nimportant part of northern Luzon. Ronquillo sent against him Captain\r\nCarreon, who expelled the intruder and established on the present\r\nsite of Lao-lo the city of Nueva Segovia. Two friars accompanied\r\nthis expedition and the occupation of this valley by the Spaniards\r\nwas made permanent.\r\n\r\nThe First Conflicts between the Church and the State.--In March, 1581,\r\nthere arrived the first Bishop of Manila, Domingo de Salazar. Almost\r\nimmediately began those conflicts between the spiritual and civil\r\nauthorities, and between bishop and the regular orders, which have\r\nfilled to such an extent the history of the islands. The bishop\r\nwas one of those authoritative, ambitious, and arrogant characters,\r\nso typical in the history of the Church. It was largely due to his\r\nprotests against the autocratic power of the governor that the king\r\nwas induced to appoint the first Audiencia. The character and power\r\nof these courts have already been explained. The president and judges\r\narrived the year following the death of Ronquillo, and the president,\r\nDr. Santiago de Vera, became acting governor during the succeeding\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\nIn 1587, the first Dominicans, fifteen in number, arrived, and founded\r\ntheir celebrated mission, La Provincia del Santisimo Rosario.\r\n\r\nIncreasing Strength of the Malays.--De Vera continued the policy of\r\nhis predecessors and another fruitless attack was made on Ternate\r\nin 1585. The power of the Malay people was increasing, while that of\r\nthe Europeans was decreasing. The sultans had expelled their foreign\r\nmasters, and neither Spaniard nor Portuguese were able to effect\r\nthe conquest of the Moluccas. There were uprisings of the natives in\r\nManila and in Cagayan and Ilocos.\r\n\r\nThe Decree of 1589.--Affairs in the Islands did not yet, however,\r\nsuit Bishop Salazar, and as the representative of both governor and\r\nbishop, the Jesuit, Alonso Sanchez, was dispatched in 1586 to lay the\r\nneeds of the colony before the king. Philip was apparently impressed\r\nwith the necessity of putting the government of the Islands upon a\r\nbetter administrative basis. To this end he published the important\r\ndecree of 1589.\r\n\r\nThe governor now became a paid officer of the crown, at a salary of\r\nten thousand ducats. For the proper protection of the colony and the\r\nconquest of the Moluccas, a regular force of four hundred soldiers\r\naccompanied the governor. His powers were extended to those of an\r\nactual viceregent of the king, and the Audiencia was abolished. The man\r\nselected to occupy this important post was Don Gomez Perez Dasmarinas,\r\nwho arrived with the new constitution in May, 1590. So great was\r\nthe chagrin of the bishop at the abolition of the Audiencia and the\r\nincrease of the governor's power, that he himself set out for Spain\r\nto lay his wishes before the court.\r\n\r\nThe Missionary Efforts of the Friars.--Twenty-four Franciscans came\r\nwith Dasmarinas and the presence of the three orders necessitated the\r\npartition of the Islands among them. The keenest rivalry and jealousy\r\nexisted among them over the prosecution of missions in still more\r\nforeign lands. To the missionaries of this age it seemed a possible\r\nthing to convert the great and conservative nations of China and\r\nJapan to the Western religion.\r\n\r\nIn the month of Dasmarinas' arrival, a company of Dominicans attempted\r\nto found a mission in China, and, an embassy coming from Japan to\r\ndemand vassalage from the Philippines, four of the newly arrived\r\nFranciscans accompanied the Japanese on their return.\r\n\r\nA year later, in 1592, another embassy from the king of Cambodia\r\narrived, bringing gifts that included two elephants, and petitioning\r\nfor succor against the king of Siam. This was the beginning of an\r\nalliance between Cambodia and the Philippines which lasted for many\r\nyears, and which occasioned frequent military aid and many efforts\r\nto convert that country.\r\n\r\nDeath of Dasmarinas.--But the center of Dasmarinas' ambitions was the\r\neffective conquest of the East Indies and the extension of Spanish\r\npower and his own rule through the Moluccas. With this end in view,\r\nfor three years he made preparations. For months the shores were lined\r\nwith the yards of the shipbuilders, and the great forests of Bulacan\r\nfell before the axes of the Indians. More than two hundred vessels,\r\n\"galeras,\" \"galeotas,\" and \"virrayes,\" were built, and assembled\r\nat Cavite.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1593, the expedition, consisting of over nine\r\nhundred Spaniards, Filipino bowmen and rowers, was ready. Many of the\r\nFilipinos, procured to row these boats, were said to have been slaves,\r\npurchased through the Indian chiefs by the Spanish encomenderos. The\r\ngovernor sent forward this great fleet under the command of his son,\r\nDon Luis, and in the month of October he himself set sail in a galley\r\nwith Chinese rowers. But on the night of the second day, while off the\r\nisland of Maricaban, the Chinese oarsmen rose against the Spaniards,\r\nof whom there were about forty on the ship, and killed almost the\r\nentire number, including the governor. They then escaped in the boat\r\nto the Ilocos coast and thence to China.\r\n\r\nThe murder of this active and illustrious general was a determining\r\nblow to the ambitious projects for the conquest of the East\r\nIndies. Among other papers which Dasmarinas brought from Spain was a\r\nroyal cedula giving him power to nominate his successor, who proved to\r\nbe his son, Don Luis, who after some difficulty succeeded temporarily\r\nto his father's position.\r\n\r\nArrival of the Jesuits.--In June, 1595, there arrived Don Antonio de\r\nMorga, who had been appointed assessor and lieutenant-governor of\r\nthe Islands, to succeed Don Luis. With Morga came the first Jesuit\r\nmissionaries. He was also the bearer of an order granting to the\r\nJesuits the exclusive privilege of conducting missions in China and\r\nJapan. The other orders were forbidden to pass outside the Islands.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to Colonize Mindanao.--In the year 1596, the Captain\r\nRodriguez de Figueroa received the title of governor of Mindanao,\r\nwith exclusive right to colonize the island for \"the space of\r\ntwo lives.\" He left Iloilo in April with 214 Spaniards, two Jesuit\r\npriests, and many natives. They landed in the Rio Grande of Mindanao,\r\nwhere the defiant dato, Silonga, fortified himself and resisted\r\nthem. Almost immediately Figueroa rashly ventured on shore and was\r\nkilled by Moros. Reinforcements were sent under Don Juan Ronquillo,\r\nwho, after nearly bringing the datos to submission, abandoned all he\r\nhad gained. The Spaniards burned their forts on the Rio Grande and\r\nretired to Caldera, near Zamboanga, where they built a presidio.\r\n\r\nDeath of Franciscans in Japan.--The new governor, Don Francisco\r\nTello de Guzman, arrived on June 1, 1596. He had previously been\r\ntreasurer of the Casa de Contratacion in Seville. Soon after his\r\narrival an important and serious tragedy occurred in Japan. The ship\r\nfor Acapulco went ashore on the Japanese coast and its rich cargo was\r\nseized by the feudal prince where the vessel sought assistance. The\r\nFranciscans had already missions in these islands, and a quarrel\r\nexisted between them and the Portuguese Jesuits over this missionary\r\nfield. The latter succeeded in prejudicing the Japanese court against\r\nthe Franciscans, and when they injudiciously pressed for the return\r\nof the property of the wrecked galleon, \"San Felipe,\" the emperor,\r\ngreedy for the rich plunder, and exasperated by their preaching,\r\nmet their petitions with the sentence of death. They were horribly\r\ncrucified at the port of Nagasaki, February 5, 1597. This emperor was\r\nthe proud and cruel ruler, Taycosama. He was planning the conquest\r\nof the Philippines themselves, when death ended his plans.\r\n\r\nThe First Archbishop in the Philippines.--Meanwhile the efforts of\r\nSalazar at the Spanish court had effected further important changes\r\nfor the Islands. The reestablishment of the Royal Audiencia was\r\nordered, and his own position was elevated to that of archbishop,\r\nwith the three episcopal sees of Ilocos, Cebu, and the Camarines. He\r\ndid not live to assume this office, and the first archbishop of the\r\nPhilippines was Ignacio Santibanez, who also died three months after\r\nhis arrival, on May 28, 1598.\r\n\r\nReestablishment of the Audiencia.--The Audiencia was reestablished with\r\ngreat pomp and ceremony. The royal seal was borne on a magnificently\r\ncaparisoned horse to the cathedral, where a Te Deum was chanted,\r\nand then to the Casas Reales, where was inaugurated the famous court\r\nthat continued without interruption down to the end of Spanish\r\nrule. Dr. Morga was one of the first oidores, and the earliest\r\njudicial record which can now be found in the archives of this court\r\nis a sentence bearing his signature.\r\n\r\nThe Rise of Moro Piracy.--The last years of De Guzman's governorship\r\nwere filled with troubles ominous for the future of the Islands. The\r\npresidio of Caldera was destroyed by the Moros. Following this\r\nvictory, in the year 1599, the Moros of Jolo and Maguindanao equipped\r\na piratical fleet of fifty caracoas, and swept the coasts of the\r\nBisayas. Cebu, Negros, and Panay were ravaged, their towns burned,\r\nand their inhabitants carried off as slaves.\r\n\r\nThe following year saw the return of a larger and still more dreadful\r\nexpedition. The people of Panay abandoned their towns and fled into\r\nthe mountains, under the belief that these terrible attacks had been\r\ninspired by the Spaniards. To check these pirates, Juan Gallinato,\r\nwith a force of two hundred Spaniards, was sent against Jolo,\r\nbut, like so many expeditions that followed his, he accomplished\r\nnothing. The inability of the Spaniards was now revealed and the\r\nera of Moro piracy had begun. \"From this time until the present day\"\r\n(about the year 1800), wrote Zuniga, \"these Moros have not ceased to\r\ninfest our colonies; innumerable are the Indians they have captured,\r\nthe towns they have looted, the rancherias they have destroyed, the\r\nvessels they have taken. It seems as if God has preserved them for\r\nvengeance on the Spaniards that they have not been able to subject\r\nthem in two hundred years, in spite of the expeditions sent against\r\nthem, the armaments sent almost very year to pursue them. In a very\r\nlittle while we conquered all the islands of the Philippines; but the\r\nlittle island of Jolo, a part of Mindanao, and other islands near by\r\nwe have not been able to subjugate to this day.\" [32]\r\n\r\nBattle at Mariveles with the Dutch.--In October, 1600, two Dutch\r\nvessels appeared in the Islands; it was the famous expedition of\r\nthe Dutch admiral, Van Noort. They had come through the Straits of\r\nMagellan, on a voyage around the world. The Dutch were in great need of\r\nprovisions. As they were in their great enemy's colony, they captured\r\nand sunk several boats, Spanish and Chinese, bound for Manila with\r\nrice, poultry, palm-wine, and other stores of food. At Mariveles,\r\na Japanese vessel from Japan was overhauled. Meanwhile in Manila\r\ngreat excitement and activity prevailed. The Spaniards fitted up two\r\ngalleons and the \"Oidor\" Morga himself took command with a large crew\r\nof fighting men.\r\n\r\nOn November 14, they attacked the Dutch, whose crews were greatly\r\nreduced to only eighty men on both ships. The vessel commanded by\r\nMorga ran down the flagship of Van Noort, and for hours the ships lay\r\nside by side while a hand-to-hand fight raged on the deck and in the\r\nhold. The ships taking fire, Morga disengaged his ship, which was so\r\nbadly shattered that it sank, with great loss of life; but Morga and\r\nsome others reached the little island of Fortuna. Van Noort was able\r\nto extinguish the fire on his vessel, and escape from the Islands. He\r\neventually reached Holland. His smaller vessel was captured with its\r\ncrew of twenty-five men, who were all hung at Cavite. [33]\r\n\r\nOther Troubles of the Spanish.--In the year 1600, two ships sailed\r\nfor Acapulco, but one went down off the Catanduanes and the other was\r\nshipwrecked on the Ladrones. \"On top of all other misfortunes, Manila\r\nsuffered, in the last months of this government, a terrible earthquake,\r\nwhich destroyed many houses and the church of the Jesuits.\" [34]\r\n\r\nThe Moros, the Dutch, anxieties and losses by sea, the visitations\r\nof God,--how much of the history of the seventeenth century in the\r\nPhilippines is filled with these four things!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINES THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition of the Archipelago at the Beginning of the Seventeenth\r\nCentury.--The Spanish Rule Completely Established.--At the close\r\nof the sixteenth century the Spaniards had been in possession of\r\nthe Philippines for a generation. In these thirty-five years the\r\nmost striking of all the results of the long period of Spanish\r\noccupation were accomplished. The work of these first soldiers and\r\nmissionaries established the limits and character of Spanish rule as\r\nit was to remain for 250 years. Into this first third of a century\r\nthe Spaniard crowded all his heroic feats of arms, exploration,\r\nand conversion. Thereafter, down to 1850, new fields were explored,\r\nand only a few new tribes Christianized.\r\n\r\nThe survey of the archipelago given by Morga soon after 1600 reads\r\nlike a narrative of approximately modern conditions. It reveals to\r\nus how great had been the activities of the early Spaniard and how\r\nsmall the achievements of his countrymen after the seventeenth century\r\nbegan. All of the large islands, except Paragua and the Moro country,\r\nwere, in that day, under encomiendas, their inhabitants paying tributes\r\nand for the most part professing the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nThe smaller groups and islets were almost as thoroughly exploited. Even\r\nof the little Catanduanes, lying off the Pacific coast of Luzon,\r\nMorga could say, \"They are well populated with natives,--a good\r\nrace, all encomended to Spaniards, with doctrine and churches, and\r\nan alcalde-mayor, who does justice among them.\"\r\n\r\nHe says of the Babuyanes at the extreme north of the archipelago,\r\n\"They are not encomended, nor is tribute collected among them, nor\r\nare there Spaniards among them, because they are of little reason and\r\npoliteness, and there have neither been Christians made among them,\r\nnor have they justices.\" They continued in this condition until a few\r\nyears before the end of Spanish rule. In 1591, however, the Babuyanes\r\nhad been given in encomienda to Esteban de la Serna and Francisco\r\nCastillo. They are put as having two thousand inhabitants and five\r\nhundred \"tributantes,\" but all unsubdued (\"todos alcados\").\r\n\r\nOn some islands the hold of the Spaniards was more extensive in Morga's\r\nday than at a later time. Then the island of Mindoro was regarded as\r\nimportant, and in the early years and decades of Spanish power appears\r\nto have been populous along the coasts. Later it was desolated by the\r\nMoro pirates and long remained wild and almost uninhabited except by\r\na shifting population from the mainland of Luzon.\r\n\r\nThe Encomiendas.--The first vessels that followed the expedition of\r\nLegaspi had brought orders from the king that the Islands should be\r\nsettled, and divided in encomiendas to those who had conquered and\r\nwon them. [35] On this instruction, Legaspi had given the Filipinos\r\nin encomienda to his captains and soldiers as fast as the conquest\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate to have a review of these encomiendas, made in 1591,\r\nabout twenty-five years after the system was introduced into the\r\nIslands. [36] There were then 267 encomiendas in the Philippines,\r\nof which thirty-one were of the king, and the remainder of private\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nPopulation under the Encomiendas.--From the enumeration of these\r\nencomiendas, we learn that the most populous parts of the archipelago\r\nwere La Laguna, with 24,000 tributantes and 97,000 inhabitants, and the\r\nCamarines, which included all the Bicol territory, and the Catanduanes,\r\nwhere there were 21,670 tributantes and a population of over 86,000, In\r\nthe vicinity of Manila and Tondo, which included Cavite and Marigondon,\r\nthe south shore of the bay, and Pasig and Taguig, there were collected\r\n9,410 tributes, and the population was estimated at about 30,000. In\r\nIlocos were reported 17,130 tributes and 78,520 souls.\r\n\r\nThe entire valley of the Cagayan had been divided among the soldiers\r\nof the command which had effected the conquest. In the list of\r\nencomiendas a few can be recognized, such as Yguig and Tuguegarao,\r\nbut most of the names are not to be found on maps of to-day. Most of\r\nthe inhabitants were reported to be \"rebellious\" (alcados), and some\r\nwere apparently the same wild tribes which still occupy all of this\r\nwater-shed, except the very banks of the river; but none the less\r\nhad the Spaniards divided them off into \"repartimientos.\" One soldier\r\nhad even taken as an encomienda the inhabitants of the upper waters\r\nof the river, a region which is called in the Relacion \"Pugao,\" with\r\nlittle doubt the habitat of the same Igorrote tribe as the Ipugao,\r\nwho still dwell in these mountains. The upper valley of the Magat,\r\nor Nueva Vizcaya, does not appear to have been occupied and probably\r\nwas not until the missions of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe population among the Bisayan islands was quite surprisingly\r\nsmall, considering its present proportions. Masbate, for example,\r\nhad but 1,600 souls; Burias, a like number; the whole central group,\r\nleaving out Panay, only 15,833 tributes, or about 35,000 souls. There\r\nwas a single encomienda in Butuan, Mindanao, and another on the Caraga\r\ncoast. There were a thousand tributes collected in the encomienda of\r\nCuyo, and fifteen hundred in Calamianes, which, says the Relacion,\r\nincluded \"los negrillos,\" probably the mixed Negrito population of\r\nnorthern Palawan.\r\n\r\nThe entire population under encomiendas is set down as 166,903\r\ntributes, or 667,612 souls. This is, so far as known, the earliest\r\nenumeration of the population of the Philippines. Barring the Igorrotes\r\nof northern Luzon and the Moros and other tribes of Mindanao, it is\r\na fair estimate of the number of the Filipino people three hundred\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the numbers assigned to single encomenderos\r\nin the Philippines were large. In America the number was limited. As\r\nearly as 1512, King Ferdinand had forbidden any single person, of\r\nwhatever rank or grade, to hold more than three hundred Indians on\r\none island. [37] But in the Philippines, a thousand or twelve hundred\r\n\"tributantes\" were frequently held by a single Spaniard.\r\n\r\nCondition of the Filipinos under the Encomiendas.--Frequent\r\nRevolts.--That the Filipinos on many of these islands bitterly\r\nresented their condition is evidenced by the frequent uprisings\r\nand rebellions. The encomenderos were often extortionate and cruel,\r\nand absolutely heedless of the restrictions and obligations imposed\r\nupon them by the Laws of the Indies. Occasionally a new governor,\r\nunder the first impulse of instructions from Mexico or Spain, did\r\nsomething to correct abuses. Revolts were almost continuous during\r\nthe year 1583, and the condition of the natives very bad, many\r\nencomenderos regarding them and treating them almost as slaves, and\r\nkeeping them at labor to the destruction of their own crops and the\r\nmisery of their families. Gov. Santiago de Vera reached the Islands\r\nthe following year and made a characteristic attempt to improve the\r\nsystem, which is thus related by Zuniga:--\r\n\r\n\"As soon as he had taken possession of the government, he studied to\r\nput into effect the orders which he brought from the king, to punish\r\ncertain encomenderos, who had abused the favor they had received in\r\nbeing given encomiendas, whereby he deposed Bartolome de Ledesma,\r\nencomendero of Abuyo (Leyte), and others of those most culpable,\r\nand punished the others in proportion to the offenses which they had\r\ncommitted, and which had been proven.\r\n\r\n\"In the following year of 1585, he sent Juan de Morones and Pablo de\r\nLima, with a well equipped squadron, to the Moluccas, which adventure\r\nwas as unfortunate as those that had preceded it, and they returned to\r\nManila without having been able to take the fortress of Ternate. The\r\ngovernor felt it very deeply that the expedition had failed, and wished\r\nto send another armada in accordance with the orders which the king\r\nhad given him; but he could not execute this because the troops from\r\nNew Spain did not arrive, and because of the Indians, who lost no\r\noccasion which presented itself to shake off the yoke of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\"The Pampangos and many inhabitants of Manila confederated with the\r\nMoros of Borneo, who had come for trade, and plotted to enter the city\r\nby night, set it on fire, and, in the confusion of the conflagration,\r\nslay all the Spaniards. This conspiracy was discovered through an\r\nIndian woman, who was married to a Spanish soldier, and measures to\r\nmeet the conspiracy were taken, before the mine exploded, many being\r\nseized and suffering exemplary punishment.\r\n\r\n\"The islands of Samar, Ybabao, and Leyte were also in disturbance,\r\nand the encomendero of Dagami, pueblo of Leyte, was in peril of losing\r\nhis life, because the Indians were incensed by his thievings in the\r\ncollection of tribute, which was paid in wax, and which he compelled\r\nthem to have weighed with a steelyard which he had made double the\r\nlegal amount, and wanted to kill him. They would have done so if he\r\nhad not escaped into the mountains and afterwards passed by a banca\r\nto the island of Cebu. The governor sent Captain Lorenzo de la Mota\r\nto pacify these disturbances; he made some punishments, and with\r\nthese everything quieted down.\" [38]\r\n\r\nThree years later, however, the natives of Leyte were again in\r\nrevolt. In 1589 Cagayan rose and killed many Spaniards. The revolt\r\nseems to have spread from here to the town of Dingras, Ilocos, where\r\nthe natives rose against the collectors of tribute, and slew six\r\nSpaniards of the pueblo of Fernandina. (Zuniga, Historia de Filipinas,\r\np. 165.) [39]\r\n\r\nEffects of the Spanish Government.--The Spanish occupation had brought\r\nruin and misery to some parts of the country. Salazar describes with\r\nbitterness the evil condition of the Filipinos. In the rich fields\r\nof Bulacan and Pampanga, great gangs of laborers had been impressed,\r\nfelling the forests for the construction of the Spanish fleets and\r\nmanning these fleets at the oars, on voyages which took them for\r\nfour and six months from their homes. The governor, Don Gonzalez de\r\nRonquillo, had forced many Indians of Pampanga into the mines of\r\nIlocos, taking them from the sowing of their rice. Many had died\r\nin the mines and the rest returned so enfeebled that they could\r\nnot plant. Hunger and famine had descended upon Pampanga, and on\r\nthe encomienda of Guido de Lavazares over a thousand had died from\r\nstarvation. [40]\r\n\r\nThe Taxes.--The taxes were another source of abuse. Theoretically,\r\nthe tax upon Indians was limited to the \"tributo,\" the sum of eight\r\nreales (about one dollar) yearly from the heads of all families,\r\npayable either in gold or in produce of the district. But in fixing the\r\nprices of these commodities there was much extortion, the encomenderos\r\ndelaying the collection of the tribute until the season of scarcity,\r\nwhen prices were high, but insisting then on the same amount as\r\nat harvest-time.\r\n\r\nThe principal, who occupied the place of the former dato,\r\nor \"maharlica,\" like the gobernadorcillo of recent times, was\r\nresponsible for the collecting of the tribute, and his lot seems\r\nto have been a hard one. \"If they do not give as much as they ask,\r\nor do not pay for as many Indians as they say there are, they abuse\r\nthe poor principal, or throw him into the pillory (cepo de cabeza),\r\nbecause all the encomenderos, when they go to make collections, take\r\ntheir pillories with them, and there they keep him and torment him,\r\nuntil forced to give all they ask. They are even said to take the wife\r\nand daughter of the principal, when he can not be found. \"Many are the\r\nprincipales who have died under these torments, according to reports.\"\r\n\r\nSalazar further states that he has known natives to be sold into\r\nslavery, in default of tribute. Neither did they impose upon adults\r\nalone, but \"they collect tribute from infants, the aged and the slaves,\r\nand many do not marry because of the tribute, and others slay their\r\nchildren.\" [41]\r\n\r\nScarcity of Food.--Salazar further charges that the alcaldes mayores\r\n(the alcaldes of provinces), sixteen in number, were all corrupt,\r\nand, though their salaries were small, they accumulated fortunes. For\r\nfurther enumeration of economic ills, Salazar details how prices had\r\nevilly increased. In the first years of Spanish occupation, food was\r\nabundant. There was no lack of rice, beans, chickens, pigs, venison,\r\nbuffalo, fish, cocoanuts, bananas, and other fruits, wine and honey;\r\nand a little money bought much. A hundred gantas (about three hundred\r\npints) of rice could then be bought for a toston (a Portuguese coin,\r\nworth about a half-peso), eight to sixteen fowls for a like amount, a\r\nfat pig for from four to six reales. In the year of his writing (about\r\n1583), products were scarce and prices exorbitant. Rice had doubled,\r\nchickens were worth a real, a good pig six to eight pesos. Population\r\nhad decreased, and whole towns were deserted, their inhabitants having\r\nfled into the hills.\r\n\r\nGeneral Improvement under Spanish Rule.--This is one side of the\r\npicture. It probably is overdrawn by the bishop, who was jealous of the\r\ncivil authority and who began the first of those continuous clashes\r\nbetween the church and political power in the Philippines. Doubtless\r\nif we could see the whole character of Spanish rule in these decades,\r\nwe should see that the actual condition of the Filipino had improved\r\nand his grade of culture had arisen. No one can estimate the actual\r\ngood that comes to a people in being brought under the power of a\r\ngovernment able to maintain peace and dispense justice. Taxation is\r\nsometimes grievous, corruption without excuse; but almost anything\r\nis better than anarchy.\r\n\r\nBefore the coming of the Spaniards, it seems unquestionable that\r\nthe Filipinos suffered greatly under two terrible grievances that\r\ninflict barbarous society,--in the first place, warfare, with its\r\nmurder, pillage, and destruction, not merely between tribe and tribe,\r\nbut between town and town, such as even now prevails in the wild\r\nmountains of northern Luzon, among the primitive Malayan tribes;\r\nand in the second place, the weak and poor man was at the mercy of\r\nthe strong and rich.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of Spanish sovereignty had certainly mitigated, if\r\nit did not wholly remedy, these conditions. \"All of these provinces,\"\r\nMorga could write, \"are pacified and are governed from Manila,\r\nhaving alcaldes mayores, corregidors, and lieutenants, each one of\r\nwhom governs in his district or province and dispenses justice. The\r\nchieftains (principales), who formerly held the other natives in\r\nsubjection, no longer have power over them in the manner which they\r\ntyrannically employed, which is not the least benefit these natives\r\nhave received in escaping from such slavery.\" [42]\r\n\r\nOld Social Order of the Filipinos but Little Disturbed.--Some governors\r\nseem to have done their utmost to improve the condition of the people\r\nand to govern them well. Santiago de Vera, as we have seen, even went\r\nso far as to commission the worthy priest, Padre Juan de Plasencia,\r\nto investigate the customs and social organization of the Filipinos,\r\nand to prepare an account of their laws, that they might be more\r\nsuitably governed. This brief code--for so it is--was distributed\r\nto alcaldes, judges, and encomenderos, with orders to pattern their\r\ndecisions in accordance with Filipino custom. [43]\r\n\r\nIn ordering local affairs, the Spaniards to some extent left the\r\nold social order of the Filipinos undisturbed. The several social\r\nclasses were gradually suppressed, and at the head of each barrio,\r\nor small settlement, was appointed a head, or cabeza de barangay. As\r\nthese barangays were grouped into pueblos, or towns, the former datos\r\nwere appointed captains and gobernadorcillos.\r\n\r\nThe Payment of Tribute.--The tribute was introduced in 1570. [44]\r\nIt was supposed to be eight reales or a peso of silver for each\r\nfamily. Children under sixteen and those over sixty were exempt. In\r\n1590 the amount was raised to ten reales. To this was added a real\r\nfor the church, known as \"sanctorum,\" and, on the organization of the\r\ntowns, a real for the caja de communidad or municipal treasury. Under\r\nthe encomiendas the tribute was paid to the encomenderos, except\r\non the royal encomiendas; but after two or three generations, as\r\nthe encomiendas were suppressed, these collections went directly\r\nto the insular treasury. There was, in addition to the tribute,\r\na compulsory service of labor on roads, bridges, and public works,\r\nknown as the \"corvee,\" a feudal term, or perhaps more generally as the\r\n\"polos y servicios.\" Those discharging this enforced labor were called\r\n\"polistas.\"\r\n\r\nConversion of the Filipinos to Christianity.--The population had\r\nbeen very rapidly Christianized. All accounts agree that almost\r\nno difficulty was encountered in baptizing the more advanced\r\ntribes. \"There is not in these islands a province,\" says Morga,\r\n\"which resists conversion and does not desire it.\" [45] Indeed,\r\nthe Islands seem to have been ripe for the preaching of a higher\r\nfaith, either Christian or Mohammedan. For a time these two great\r\nreligions struggled together in the vicinity of Manila, [46] but\r\nat the end of three decades Spanish power and religion were alike\r\nestablished. Conversion was delayed ordinarily only by the lack of\r\nsufficient numbers of priests. We have seen that this conversion of\r\nthe people was the work of the missionary friars. In 1591 there were\r\n140 in the Islands, but the Relacion de Encomiendas calls for 160\r\nmore to properly supply the peoples which had been laid under tribute.\r\n\r\nComing of the Friars.--The Augustinians had been the first to come,\r\naccompanying Legaspi. Then came the barefooted friars of the Order of\r\nSaint Francis. The first Jesuits, padres Antonio Sedeno and Alonzo\r\nSanchez, came with the first bishop of the Islands, Domingo de\r\nSalazar, in 1580. They came apparently without resources. Even their\r\ngarments brought from Mexico had rotted on the voyage. They found\r\na little, poor, narrow house in a suburb of Manila, called Laguio\r\n(probably Concepcion). \"So poorly furnished was it,\" says Chirino,\r\n\"that the same chest which held their books was the table on which\r\nthey ate. Their food for many days was rice, cooked in water, without\r\nsalt or oil or fish or meat or even an egg, or anything else except\r\nthat sometimes as a regalo they enjoyed some salt sardines.\" [47]\r\nAfter the Jesuits, came, as we have seen, the friars of the Dominican\r\norder, and lastly the Recollects, or unshod Augustinians.\r\n\r\nDivision of the Archipelago among the Religious Orders.--The\r\narchipelago was districted among these missionary bands. The\r\nAugustinians had many parishes in the Bisayas, on the Ilocano coast,\r\nsome in Pangasinan, and all of those in Pampanga. The Dominicans\r\nhad parts of Pangasinan and all of the valley of Cagayan. The\r\nFranciscans controlled the Camarines and nearly all of southern Luzon,\r\nand the region of Laguna de Bay. All of these orders had convents\r\nand monasteries both in the city of Manila and in the country round\r\nabout. The imposing churches of brick and stone, which now characterize\r\nnearly every pueblo, had not in those early decades been erected;\r\nbut Morga tells us that \"the churches and monasteries were of wood,\r\nand well built, with furniture and beautiful ornaments, complete\r\nservice, crosses, candlesticks, and chalices of silver and gold.\" [48]\r\n\r\nThe First Schools.--Even in these early years there seem to have\r\nbeen some attempts at the education of the natives. The friars had\r\nschools in reading and writing for boys, who were also taught to\r\nserve in the church, to sing, to play the organ, the harp, guitar,\r\nand other instruments. We must remember, however, that the Filipino\r\nbefore the arrival of the Spaniard had a written language, and even\r\nin pre-Spanish times there must have been instruction given to the\r\nchild. The type of humble school, that is found to-day in remote\r\nbarrios, conducted by an old man or woman, on the floor or in the\r\nyard of a home, where the ordinary family occupations are proceeding,\r\nprobably does not owe its origin to the Spaniards, but dates from\r\na period before their arrival. The higher education established by\r\nthe Spaniards appears to have been exclusively for the children of\r\nSpaniards. In 1601 the Jesuits, pioneers of the Roman Catholic orders\r\nin education, established the College of San Jose.\r\n\r\nEstablishment of Hospitals.--The city early had notable foundations\r\nof charity. The high mortality which visited the Spaniards in\r\nthese islands and the frequency of diseases early called for the\r\nestablishment of institutions for the orphan and the invalid. In\r\nMorga's time there were the orphanages of San Andres and Santa\r\nPotenciana. There was the Royal Hospital, in charge of three\r\nFranciscans, which burned in the conflagration of 1603, but was\r\nreconstructed. There was also a Hospital of Mercy, in charge of\r\nSisters of Charity from Lisbon and the Portuguese possessions of India.\r\n\r\nClose by the Monastery of Saint Francis stood then, where it stands\r\nto-day, the hospital for natives, San Juan de Dios. It was of\r\nroyal patronage, but founded by a friar of the Franciscan order,\r\nJuan Clemente. \"Here,\" says Morga, \"are cured a great number of\r\nnatives of all kinds of sicknesses, with much charity and care. It\r\nhas a good house and offices of stone, and is administered by the\r\nbarefooted religious of Saint Francis. Three priests are there and\r\nfour lay-brethren of exemplary life, who, with the doctors, surgeons,\r\nand apothecaries, are so dexterous and skilled that they work with\r\ntheir hands marvelous cures, both in medicine and surgery.\" [49]\r\n\r\nMortality among the Spaniards.--Mortality in the Philippines in\r\nthese years of conquest was frightfully high. The waste of life in\r\nher colonial adventures, indeed, drained Spain of her best and most\r\nvigorous manhood. In the famous old English collection of voyages,\r\npublished by Hakluyt in 1598, there is printed a captured Spanish\r\nletter of the famous sea-captain, Sebastian Biscaino, on the Philippine\r\ntrade. Biscaino grieves over the loss of life which had accompanied\r\nthe conquest of the Philippines, and the treacherous climate of the\r\ntropics. \"The country is very unwholesome for us Spaniards. For within\r\nthese 20 years, of 14,000 which have gone to the Philippines, there\r\nare 13,000 of them dead, and not past 1,000 of them left alive.\" [50]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Population.--The Spanish population of the Islands\r\nwas always small,--at the beginning of the seventeenth century\r\ncertainly not more than two thousand, and probably less later in\r\nthe century. Morga divides them into five classes: the prelates and\r\necclesiastics; the encomenderos, colonizers, and conquerors; soldiers\r\nand officers of war and marine; merchants and men of business; and\r\nthe officers of his Majesty's government. \"Very few are living now,\"\r\nhe says, \"of those first conquistadores who won the land and effected\r\nthe conquest with the Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legaspi.\" [51]\r\n\r\nThe Largest Cities.--Most of this Spanish population dwelt in Manila\r\nor in the five other cities which the Spaniards had founded in the\r\nfirst three decades of their occupation. Those were as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe City of Nueva Segovia, at the mouth of the Cagayan, was founded\r\nin the governorship of Ronquillo, when the valley of the Cagayan was\r\nfirst occupied and the Japanese colonists, who had settled there,\r\nwere expelled. It had at the beginning of the seventeenth century two\r\nhundred Spaniards, living in houses of wood. There was a fort of stone,\r\nwhere some artillery was mounted. Besides the two hundred Spanish\r\ninhabitants there were one hundred regular Spanish soldiers, with\r\ntheir officers and the alcalde mayor of the province. Nueva Segovia\r\nwas also the seat of a bishopric which included all northern Luzon. The\r\nimportance of the then promising city has long ago disappeared, and the\r\npueblo of Lallo, which marks its site, is an insignificant native town.\r\n\r\nThe City of Nueva Caceres, in the Camarines, was founded by Governor\r\nLa-Sande. It, too, was the seat of a bishopric, and had one hundred\r\nSpanish inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Cities of Cebu and Iloilo.--In the Bisayas were the Cities of\r\nthe Holy Name of God (Cebu), and on the island of Panay, Arevalo (or\r\nIloilo). The first maintained something of the importance attaching\r\nto the first Spanish settlement. It had its stone fort and was also\r\nthe seat of a bishopric. It was visited by trading-vessels from the\r\nMoluccas, and by permit of the king enjoyed for a time the unusual\r\nprivilege of sending annually a ship loaded with merchandise to New\r\nSpain. Arevalo had about eighty Spanish inhabitants, and a monastery\r\nof the Augustinians.\r\n\r\nThe City of Fernandina, or Vigan, which Salcedo had founded, was nearly\r\nwithout Spanish inhabitants. Still, it was the political center of the\r\ngreat Ilocano coast, and it has held this position to the present day.\r\n\r\nManila.--But all of these cities were far surpassed in importance\r\nby the capital on the banks of the Pasig. The wisdom of Legaspi's\r\nchoice had been more than justified. Manila, at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, was unquestionably the most important European\r\ncity of the East. As we have already seen, in 1580 Portugal had been\r\nannexed by Spain and with her had come all the Portuguese possessions\r\nin India, China, and Malaysia. After 1610, the Dutch were almost\r\nannually warring for this colonial empire, and Portugal regained her\r\nindependence in 1640. But for the first few years of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, Manila was the political mistress of an empire that stretched\r\nfrom Goa to Formosa and embraced all those coveted lands which for\r\na century and a half had been the desire of European states.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the Philippines was almost an independent\r\nking. Nominally, he was subordinate to the viceroy of Mexico, but\r\npractically he waged wars, concluded peaces, and received and sent\r\nembassies at his own discretion. The kingdom of Cambodia was his ally,\r\nand the states of China and Japan were his friends.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Importance of Manila.--Manila was also the commercial\r\ncenter of the Far East, and the entrepot through which the kingdoms\r\nof eastern Asia exchanged their wares. Here came great fleets of\r\njunks from China laden with stores. Morga fills nearly two pages\r\nwith an enumeration of their merchandise, which included all manner\r\nof silks, brocades, furniture, pearls and gems, fruits, nuts, tame\r\nbuffalo, geese, horses and mules, all kinds of animals, \"even to\r\nbirds in cages, some of which talk and others sing, and which they\r\nmake perform a thousand tricks; there are innumerable other gew-gaws\r\nand knickknacks, which among Spaniards are in much esteem.\" [52]\r\n\r\nEach year a fleet of thirty to forty vessels sailed with the new moon\r\nin March. The voyage across the China Sea, rough with the monsoons,\r\noccupied fifteen or twenty days, and the fleet returned at the end of\r\nMay or the beginning of June. Between October and March there came,\r\neach year, Japanese ships from Nagasaki which brought wheat, silks,\r\nobjects of art, and weapons, and took away from Manila the raw silk\r\nof China, gold, deer horns, woods, honey, wax, palm-wine, and wine\r\nof Castile.\r\n\r\nFrom Malacca and India came fleets of the Portuguese subjects of Spain,\r\nwith spices, slaves, Negroes and Kafirs, and the rich productions of\r\nBengal, India, Persia, and Turkey. From Borneo, too, came the smaller\r\ncraft of the Malays, who from their boats sold the fine palm mats,\r\nthe best of which still come from Cagayan de Sulu and Borneo, slaves,\r\nsago, water-pots and glazed earthenware, black and fine. From Siam\r\nand Cambodia also, but less often, there came trading-ships. Manila\r\nwas thus a great emporium for all the countries of the East, the\r\ntrade of which seems to have been conducted largely by and through\r\nthe merchants of Manila.\r\n\r\nTrade with Mexico and Spain Restricted.--The commerce between the\r\nPhilippines, and Mexico and Spain, though it was of vast importance,\r\nwas limited by action of the crown. It was a commerce which apparently\r\nadmitted of infinite expansion, but the shortsighted merchants and\r\nmanufacturers of the Peninsula clamored against its development,\r\nand it was subjected to the severest limitations. Four galleons\r\nwere at first maintained for this trade, which were dispatched two\r\nat a time in successive years from Manila to the port of Acapulco,\r\nMexico. The letter on the Philippine trade, already quoted, states that\r\nthese galleons were great ships of six hundred and eight hundred tons\r\napiece. [53] They went \"very strong with soldiers,\" and they carried\r\nthe annual mail, reinforcements, and supplies of Mexican silver for\r\ntrade with China, which has remained the commercial currency of the\r\nEast to the present day. Later the number of galleons was reduced\r\nto one.\r\n\r\nThe Rich Cargoes of the Galleons.--The track of the Philippine galleon\r\nlay from Luzon northeastward to about the forty-second degree of\r\nlatitude, where the westerly winds prevail, thence nearly straight\r\nacross the ocean to Cape Mendocino in northern California, which\r\nwas discovered and mapped by Biscaino in 1602. Thence the course lay\r\ndown the western coast of North America nearly three thousand miles\r\nto the port of Acapulco.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine how carefully selected and rich in quality were the\r\nmerchandises with which these solitary galleons were freighted,\r\nthe pick of all the rich stores which came to Manila. The profits\r\nwere enormous,--six and eight hundred per cent. Biscaino wrote that\r\nwith two hundred ducats invested in Spanish wares and some Flemish\r\ncommodities, he made fourteen hundred ducats; but, he added, in 1588\r\nhe lost a ship,--robbed and burned by Englishmen. On the safe arrival\r\nof these ships depended how much of the fortunes of the colony!\r\n\r\nCapture of the Galleons.--For generations these galleons were probably\r\nthe most tempting and romantic prize that ever aroused the cupidity of\r\nprivateer. The first to profit by this rich booty was Thomas Cavendish,\r\nwho in 1584 came through the Straits of Magellan with a fleet of five\r\nvessels. Like Drake before him, he ravaged the coast of South America\r\nand then steered straight away across the sea to the Moluccas. Here\r\nhe acquired information about the rich commerce of the Philippines\r\nand of the yearly voyage of the galleon. Back across the Pacific went\r\nthe fleet of Cavendish for the coast of California.\r\n\r\nIn his own narrative he tells how he beat up and down between Capes\r\nSan Lucas and Mendocino until the galleon, heavy with her riches,\r\nappeared. She fell into his hands almost without a fray. She carried\r\none hundred and twenty-two thousand pesos of gold and a great and\r\nrich store of satins, damask, and musk. Cavendish landed the Spanish\r\non the California coast, burned the \"Santa Anna,\" and then returned\r\nto the Philippines and made an attack upon the shipyard of Iloilo,\r\nbut was repulsed. He sent a letter to the governor at Manila, boasting\r\nof his capture, and then sailed for the Cape of Good Hope and home.\r\n\r\nThere is an old story that tells how his sea-worn ships came up\r\nthe Thames, their masts hung with silk and damask sails. From this\r\ntime on the venture was less safe. In 1588 there came to Spain the\r\noverwhelming disaster of her history,--the destruction of the Great\r\nArmada. From this date her power was gone, and her name was no longer\r\na terror on the seas. English freebooters controlled the oceans,\r\nand in 1610 the Dutch appeared in the East, never to withdraw.\r\n\r\nThe City of Manila Three Hundred Years Ago.--We can hardly close this\r\nchapter without some further reference to the city of Manila as it\r\nappeared three hundred years ago. Morga has fortunately left us a\r\ndetailed description from which the following points in the main are\r\ndrawn. As we have already seen, Legaspi had laid out the city on the\r\nblackened site of the town and fortress of the Mohammedan prince,\r\nwhich had been destroyed in the struggle for occupation. He gave it\r\nthe same extent and dimensions that it possesses to this day.\r\n\r\nLike other colonial capitals in the Far East, it was primarily a\r\ncitadel and refuge from attack. On the point between the sea and\r\nthe river Legaspi had built the famous and permanent fortress of\r\nSantiago. In the time of the great Adelantado it was probably only a\r\nwooden stockade, but under the governor Santiago de Vera it was built\r\nup of stone. Cavendish (1587) describes Manila as \"an unwalled town and\r\nof no great strength,\" but under the improvements and completions made\r\nby Dasmarinas about 1590 it assumed much of its present appearance. Its\r\nguns thoroughly commanded the entrance to the river Pasig and made\r\nthe approach of hostile boats from the harbor side impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy, then, that all the assaults that have been made\r\nupon the city, from that of Limahong, to those of the British in 1763,\r\nand of the Americans in 1898, have been directed against the southern\r\nwall by an advance from Paranaque. Dasmarinas also inclosed the city\r\nwith a stone wall, the base from which the present noble rampart has\r\narisen. It had originally a width of from seven and a half to nine\r\nfeet. Of its height no figure is given, Morga says simply that with\r\nits buttresses and turrets it was sufficiently high for the purposes\r\nof defense.\r\n\r\nThe Old Fort.--There was a stone fort on the south side facing Ermita,\r\nknown as the Fortress of Our Lady of Guidance; and there were two\r\nor more bastions, each with six pieces of artillery,--St. Andrew's,\r\nnow a powder magazine at the southeast corner, and St. Gabriel's,\r\nover-looking the Parian district, where the Chinese were settled.\r\n\r\nThe three principal gates to the city, with the smaller wickets and\r\nposterns, which opened on the river and sea, were regularly closed\r\nat night by the guard which made the rounds. At each gate and wicket\r\nwas a permanent post of soldiers and artillerists.\r\n\r\nThe Plaza de Armas adjacent to the fort had its arsenal, stores,\r\npowder-works, and a foundry for the casting of guns and artillery. The\r\nfoundry, when established by Ronquillo, was in charge of a Pampangan\r\nIndian called Pandapira.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Buildings of the City.--The buildings of the city,\r\nespecially the Casas Reales and the churches and monasteries, had been\r\ndurably erected of stone. Chirino claims that the hewing of stone, the\r\nburning of lime, and the training of native and Chinese artisans for\r\nthis building, were the work of the Jesuit father, Sedeno. He himself\r\nfashioned the first clay tiles and built the first stone house, and so\r\nurged and encouraged others, himself directing, the building of public\r\nworks, that the city, which a little before had been solely of timber\r\nand cane, had become one of the best constructed and most beautiful\r\nin the Indies. [54] He it was also who sought out Chinese painters\r\nand decorators and ornamented the churches with images and paintings.\r\n\r\nWithin the walls, there were some six hundred houses of a private\r\nnature, most of them built of stone and tile, and an equal number\r\noutside in the suburbs, or \"arrabales,\" all occupied by Spaniards\r\n(\"todos son vivienda y poblacion de los Espanoles\"). [55]\r\n\r\nThis gives some twelve hundred Spanish families or establishments,\r\nexclusive of the religious, who in Manila numbered at least one\r\nhundred and fifty, [56] the garrison, at certain times, about four\r\nhundred trained Spanish soldiers who had seen service in Holland and\r\nthe Low Countries, and the official classes.\r\n\r\nThe Malecon and the Luneta.--It is interesting at this early date to\r\nfind mention of the famous recreation drive, the Paseo de Bagumbayan,\r\nnow commonly known as the Malecon and Luneta. \"Manila,\" says our\r\nhistorian, \"has two places of recreation on land; the one, which is\r\nclean and wide, extends from the point called Our Lady of Guidance\r\nfor about a league along the sea, and through the street and village\r\nof natives, called Bagumbayan, to a very devout hermitage (Ermita),\r\ncalled the Hermitage of Our Lady of Guidance, and from there a good\r\ndistance to a monastery and mission (doctrina) of the Augustinians,\r\ncalled Mahalat (Malate).\" [57] The other drive lay out through the\r\npresent suburb of Concepcion, then called Laguio, to Paco, where was\r\na monastery of the Franciscans.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese in Manila.--Early Chinese Commerce.--We have seen that\r\neven as long ago as three hundred years Manila was a metropolis of\r\nthe Eastern world. Vessels from many lands dropped anchor at the\r\nmouth of the Pasig, and their merchants set up their booths within\r\nher markets. Slaves from far-distant India and Africa were sold under\r\nher walls. Surely it was a cosmopolitan population that the shifting\r\nmonsoons carried to and from her gates.\r\n\r\nBut of all these Eastern races only one has been a constant and\r\nimportant factor in the life of the Islands. This is the Chinese. It\r\ndoes not appear that they settled in the country or materially affected\r\nthe life of the Filipinos until the establishment of Manila by the\r\nSpaniards. The Spaniards were early desirous of cultivating friendly\r\nrelations with the Empire of China. Salcedo, on his first punitive\r\nexpedition to Mindoro, had found a Chinese junk, which had gone\r\nashore on the western coast. He was careful to rescue these voyagers\r\nand return them to their own land, with a friendly message inviting\r\ntrading relations. Commerce and immigration followed immediately the\r\nfounding of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are without question the most remarkable colonizers in the\r\nworld. They seem able to thrive in any climate. They readily marry with\r\nevery race. The children that follow such unions are not only numerous\r\nbut healthy and intelligent. The coasts of China teem with overcrowding\r\npopulations. Emigration to almost any land means improvement of the\r\nChinese of poor birth. These qualities and conditions, with their\r\nkeen sense for trade and their indifference to physical hardship and\r\ndanger, make the Chinese almost a dominant factor wherever political\r\nbarriers have not been raised against their entrance.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese had early gained an important place in the commercial and\r\nindustrial life of Manila. A letter to the king from Bishop Salazar\r\nshows that he befriended them and was warm in their praise. [58]\r\nThis was in 1590, and there were then in Manila and Tondo about\r\nseven thousand resident Chinese, and they were indispensable to the\r\nprosperity of the city.\r\n\r\nImportance of Chinese Labor and Trade.--In the early decades\r\nof Spanish rule, the Philippines were poor in resources and the\r\npopulation was sparse, quite insufficient for the purposes of the\r\nSpanish colonizers. Thus the early development of the colony was\r\nbased upon Chinese labor and Chinese trade. As the early writers are\r\nfond of emphasizing, from China came not only the finished silks and\r\ncostly wares, which in large part were destined for the trade to New\r\nSpain and Europe, but also cattle, horses and mares, foodstuffs,\r\nmetals, fruits, and even ink and paper. \"And what is more,\" says\r\nChirino, \"from China come those who supply every sort of service,\r\nall dexterous, prompt, and cheap, from physicians and barbers to\r\nburden-bearers and porters. They are the tailors and shoemakers,\r\nmetal-workers, silversmiths, sculptors, locksmiths, painters, masons,\r\nweavers, and finally every kind of servitors in the commonwealth.\" [59]\r\n\r\nDistrust of the Chinese.--In those days, not only were the\r\nChinese artisans and traders, but they were also farmers and\r\nfishermen,--occupations in which they are now not often seen. But in\r\nspite of their economic necessity, the Chinese were always looked\r\nupon with disfavor and their presence with dread. Plots of murder\r\nand insurrection were supposedly rife among them. Writers object that\r\ntheir numbers were so great that there was no security in the land;\r\ntheir life was bad and vicious; through intercourse with them the\r\nnatives advanced but little in Christianity and customs; they were\r\nsuch terrible eaters that they made foods scarce and prices high.\r\n\r\nIf permitted, they went everywhere through the Islands and committed\r\na thousand abuses and offenses. They explored every spot, river,\r\nestero, and harbor, and knew the country better even than the Spaniard\r\nhimself, so that if any enemy should come they would be able to cause\r\ninfinite mischief. [60] When we find so just and high-minded a man as\r\nthe president of the Audiencia, Morga, giving voice to such charges,\r\nwe may be sure that the feeling was deep and terrible, and practically\r\nuniversal among all Spanish inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe First Massacre of the Chinese.--Each race feared and suspected the\r\nother, and from this mutual cowardice came in 1603 a cruel outbreak\r\nand massacre. Three Chinese mandarins arrived in that year, stating\r\nthat they had been sent by the emperor to investigate a report that\r\nthere was a mountain in Cavite of solid precious metal. This myth was\r\nno more absurd than many pursued by the Spaniards themselves in their\r\nearly conquests, and it doubtless arose from the fact that Chinese\r\nwares were largely purchased by Mexican bullion; but the Spaniards\r\nwere at once filled with suspicion of an invasion, and their distrust\r\nturned against the Chinese in the Islands.\r\n\r\nHow far these latter were actually plotting sedition and how far they\r\nwere driven into attack by their fears at the conduct of the Spaniards\r\ncan hardly be decided. But the fact is, that on the evening of Saint\r\nFrancis day the Chinese of the Parian rose. The dragon banners were\r\nraised, war-gongs were beaten, and that night the pueblos of Quiapo\r\nand Tondo were burned and many Filipinos murdered.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a force of 130 Spaniards, under Don Luis Dasmarinas and\r\nDon Tomas Bravo, were sent across the river, and in the fight nearly\r\nevery Spaniard was slain. The Chinese then assaulted the city, but,\r\naccording to the tradition of the priests, they were driven back in\r\nterror by the apparition on the walls of Saint Francis. They threw up\r\nforts on the site of the Parian and in Dilao, but the power of their\r\nwild fury was gone and the Spaniards were able to dislodge and drive\r\nthem into the country about San Pablo de Monte. From here they were\r\ndispersed with great slaughter. Twenty-three thousand Chinese are\r\nreported by Zuniga to have perished in this sedition. If his report\r\nis true, the number of Chinese in the Islands must have increased\r\nvery rapidly between 1590 and 1603.\r\n\r\nRestriction of Chinese Immigration and Travel.--Commerce and\r\nimmigration began again almost immediately. The number of Chinese,\r\nhowever, allowed to remain was reduced. The Chinese ships that came\r\nannually to trade were obliged to take back with them the crews and\r\npassengers which they brought. Only a limited number of merchants and\r\nartisans were permitted to live in the Islands. They were confined\r\nto three districts in the city of Manila, and to the great market,\r\nthe Alcayceria or Parian.\r\n\r\nThe word \"Parian\" seems to have been also used for the Chinese quarter\r\nin and adjoining the walled city, but here is meant the district in\r\nBinondo about the present Calle San Fernando. A block of stores with\r\nsmall habitations above them had been built as early as the time of\r\nGonsalez. It was in the form of a square, and here were the largest\r\nnumbers of shops and stores.\r\n\r\nThey could not travel about the Islands, nor go two leagues from the\r\ncity without a written license, nor remain over night within the city\r\nafter the gates were closed, on penalty of their lives. They had their\r\nown alcalde and judge, a tribunal and jail; and on the north side of\r\nthe river Dominican friars, who had learned the Chinese language,\r\nhad erected a mission and hospital. There was a separate barrio\r\nfor the baptized Chinese and their families, to the number of about\r\nfive hundred.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese in the Philippines from the earliest time to the present\r\nhave been known by the name of \"Sangleyes.\" The derivation of this\r\ncurious word is uncertain; but Navarrete, who must have understood\r\nChinese well, says that the word arose from a misapprehension of\r\nthe words spoken by the Chinese who first presented themselves at\r\nManila. \"Being asked what they came for, they answered, 'Xang Lei,'\r\nthat is, 'We come to trade.' The Spaniards, who understood not their\r\nlanguage, conceiving it to be the name of a country, and putting the\r\ntwo words together, made one of them, by which they still distinguish\r\nthe Chinese, calling them Sangleyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Colony.--There was also in those early years quite a\r\ncolony of Japanese. Their community lay between the Parian and the\r\nbarrio of Laguio. There were about five hundred, and among them the\r\nFranciscans claimed a goodly number of converts.\r\n\r\nThe Filipino District of Tondo.--We have described at some length\r\nthe city south of the river and the surrounding suburbs, most of them\r\nknown by the names they hold to-day. North of the Pasig was the great\r\ndistrict of Tondo, the center of that strong, independent Filipino\r\nfeeling which at an early date was colored with Mohammedanism and to\r\nthis day is strong in local feeling. This region has thriven and built\r\nup until it has long been by far the most important and populous part\r\nof the metropolis, but not until very recent times was it regarded as\r\na part of the city of Manila, which name was reserved for the walled\r\ncitadel alone.\r\n\r\nA bridge across the Pasig, on the site of the present Puente de Espana,\r\nconnected the two districts at a date later than Morga's time. It was\r\none of the first things noticed by Navarrete, who, without describing\r\nit well, says it was very fine. It was built during the governorship\r\nof Nino de Tabora, who died in 1632. [61] Montero states that it was\r\nof stone, and that this same bridge stood for more than two centuries,\r\nresisting the incessant traffic and the strength of floods. [62]\r\n\r\nThe Decline of Manila during the Next Century.--Such was Manila\r\nthirty-five and forty years after its foundation. It was at the zenith\r\nof its importance, the capital of the eastern colonies, the mart of\r\nAsia, more splendid than Goa, more powerful than Malacca or Macao, more\r\npopulous and far more securely held than Ternate and Tidor. \"Truly,\"\r\nexclaimed Chirino, \"it is another Tyre, so magnified by Ezekiel.\" It\r\nowed its great place to the genius and daring of the men who founded\r\nit, to the freedom of action which it had up to this point enjoyed,\r\nand to its superlative situation.\r\n\r\nIn the years that followed we have to recount for the most part only\r\nthe process of decline. Spain herself was fast on the wane. A few\r\nyears later and the English had almost driven her navies from the\r\nseas, the Portuguese had regained their independence and lost empire,\r\nthe Dutch were in the East, harrying Portuguese and Spaniard alike\r\nand fast monopolizing the rich trade. The commerce and friendly\r\nrelations with the Chinese, on which so much depended, were broken\r\nby massacre and reprisal; and, most terrible and piteous of all, the\r\nawful wrath and lust of the Malay pirate, for decade after decade,\r\nwas to be visited upon the archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe colonial policy of the mother-land, selfish, shortsighted, and\r\ncriminal, was soon to make its paralyzing influence felt upon trade\r\nand administration alike. These things were growing and taking place\r\nin the next period which we have to consider,--the years from 1600\r\nto 1663. They left the Philippines despoiled and insignificant for a\r\nwhole succeeding century, a decadent colony and an exploited treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH AND MORO WARS. 1600-1663.\r\n\r\n\r\nLoss of the Naval Power of Spain and Portugal.--The seizure of\r\nPortugal by Philip II. in 1580 was disastrous in its consequences to\r\nboth Portugal and Spain. For Portugal it was humiliation and loss\r\nof colonial power. Spain was unequal to the task of defending the\r\nPortuguese possessions, and her jealousy of their prosperity seems to\r\nhave caused her deliberately to neglect their interests and permit\r\ntheir decline. In one day Portugal lost possession of that splendid\r\nand daring navy which had first found a way to the Indies. Several\r\nhundred Portuguese ships, thousands of guns, and large sums of money\r\nwere appropriated by Spain upon the annexation of Portugal. [63]\r\nMost of these ill-fated ships went down in the English Channel with\r\nthe Great Armada.\r\n\r\nWhen the terrible news of the destruction of this powerful armament,\r\non which rested Spanish hopes for the conquest and humiliation of\r\nEngland, was brought to the Escorial, the magnificent palace where\r\nthe years of the king were passed, Philip II., that strange man,\r\nwhose countenance never changed at tidings of either defeat or\r\nvictory, is reported to have simply said, \"I thank God that I have\r\nthe power to replace the loss.\" He was fatuously mistaken. The loss\r\ncould never be made good. The navies of Spain and Portugal were never\r\nfully rebuilt. In that year (1588), preeminence on the sea passed to\r\nthe English and the Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands Become an Independent Country.--Who were these Dutch,\r\nor Hollanders? How came they to wrest from Spain and Portugal a\r\ncolonial empire, which they hold to-day without loss of prosperity or\r\nevidence of decline? In the north of Europe, facing the North Sea,\r\nis a low, rich land, intersected by rivers and washed far into its\r\ninterior by the tides, known as Holland, the Low Countries, or the\r\nNetherlands. Its people have ever been famed for their industry and\r\nhardihood. In manufacture and trade in the latter Middle Age, they\r\nstood far in the lead in northern Europe, Their towns and cities were\r\nthe thriftiest, most prosperous, and most cleanly.\r\n\r\nWe have already explained the curious facts of succession by which\r\nthese countries became a possession of the Spanish king, Emperor\r\nCharles the Fifth. The Low Countries were always greatly prized by\r\nCharles, and in spite of the severities of his rule he held their\r\naffection and loyalty until his death. It was in the city of Antwerp\r\nthat he formally abdicated in favor of his son, Philip II., and,\r\nas described by contemporary historians, this solemn and imposing\r\nceremony was witnessed with every mark of loyalty by the assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Rebellion.--But the oppressions and persecutions of Philip's\r\nreign drove the people to rebellion. The Netherlands had embraced the\r\nProtestant religion, and when, in addition to plunder, intimidation,\r\nthe quartering of Spanish soldiery, and the violation of sovereign\r\npromises, Philip imposed that terrible and merciless institution,\r\nthe Spanish Inquisition, the Low Countries faced the tyrant in a\r\npassion of rebellion.\r\n\r\nWar, begun in 1556, dragged on for years. There was pitiless cruelty,\r\nand the sacking of cities was accompanied by fearful butchery. In\r\n1575 the seven Dutch counties declared their independence, and formed\r\nthe republic of the Netherlands. Although the efforts of Spain to\r\nreconquer the territory continued until the end of the century,\r\npractical independence was gained some years before.\r\n\r\nTrade between Portugal and the Netherlands Forbidden.--A large portion\r\nof the commerce of the Low Countries had been with Lisbon. The\r\nPortuguese did not distribute to Europe the products which their\r\nnavies brought from the Indies. Foreign merchants purchased in Lisbon\r\nand carried these wares to other lands, and to a very large degree\r\nthis service had been performed by the Dutch. But on the annexation\r\nof Portugal, Philip forbade all commerce and trade between the two\r\ncountries. By this act the Dutch, deprived of their Lisbon trade,\r\nhad to face the alternative of commercial ruin or the gaining of those\r\nEastern products for themselves. They chose the latter course with all\r\nits risks. It was soon made possible by the destruction of the Armada.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Expeditions to the Indies.--In 1595 their first expedition,\r\nled by one Cornelius Houtman, who had sailed in Portuguese galleons,\r\nrounded the Cape of Good Hope and entered the Indian domain. The\r\nobjective point was Java, where an alliance was formed with the\r\nnative princes and a cargo of pepper secured. Two things were shown\r\nby the safe return of this fleet,--the great wealth and profit of\r\nthe Indian trade, and the inability of Spain and Portugal to maintain\r\ntheir monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn 1598 the merchants of Amsterdam defeated a combined Spanish and\r\nPortuguese fleet in the East, and trading settlements were secured\r\nin Java and Johore. In 1605 they carried their factories to Amboina\r\nand Tidor.\r\n\r\nEffect of the Success of the Dutch.--The exclusive monopoly over the\r\nwaters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, which Portugal and Spain\r\nhad maintained for a century, was broken. With the concurrence of\r\nthe Roman See, they had tried to divide the New World and the Orient\r\nbetween them. That effort was now passed. They had claimed the right\r\nto exclude from the vast oceans they had discovered the vessels of\r\nevery other nation but their own.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine in the History of International Law is known as that\r\nof mare clausum, or \"closed sea.\" The death-blow to this domination\r\nwas given by the entrance of the Dutch into the Indies, and it is\r\nnot a mere coincidence that we find the doctrine of closed sea itself\r\nscientifically assailed, a few years later, by the great Dutch jurist,\r\nGrotius, the founder of the system of international law in his work,\r\nDe Libero Mare.\r\n\r\nThe Trading Methods of the Dutch.--The Dutch made no attempts in the\r\nIndies to found great colonies for political domination and religious\r\nconversion. Commerce was their sole object. Their policy was to form\r\nalliances with native rulers, promising to assist them against the\r\nrule of the Portuguese or Spaniard in return for exclusive privileges\r\nof trade. In this they were more than successful.\r\n\r\nIn 1602 they obtained permission to establish a factory at\r\nBantam, on the island of Java. This was even then a considerable\r\ntrading-point. \"Chinese, Arabs, Persians, Moors, Turks, Malabars,\r\nPeguans, and merchants from all nations were established there,\"\r\nthe principal object of trade being pepper. [64]\r\n\r\nThe character of the treaty made by the Dutch with the king of Bantam\r\nis stated by Raffles. \"The Dutch stipulated to assist him against\r\nforeign invaders, particularly Spaniards and Portuguese; and the king,\r\non his side, agreed to make over to the Dutch a good and strong fort,\r\na free trade, and security for \"their persons and property without\r\npayment of any duties or taxes, and to allow no other European nation\r\nto trade or reside in his territories.\"\r\n\r\nSpanish Expedition against the Dutch in the Moluccas.--The Spaniards,\r\nhowever, did not relinquish the field to these new foes without\r\na struggle, and the conflict fills the history of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. When the Dutch expelled the Portuguese from Amboina and Tidor\r\nin February, 1605, many of the Portuguese came to the Philippines\r\nand enlisted in the Spanish forces. The governor, Don Pedro Bravo de\r\nAcuna, filled with wrath at the loss of these important possessions,\r\nwith great activity organized an expedition for their conquest.\r\n\r\nIn the previous year there had arrived from Spain eight hundred\r\ntroops, two hundred of them being native Mexicans. Thus Acuna was\r\nable to organize a powerful fleet that mounted seventy-five pieces\r\nof artillery and carried over fourteen hundred Spaniards and sixteen\r\nhundred Indians. [65] The fleet sailed in January, 1606. Tidor was\r\ntaken without resistance and the Dutch factory seized, with a great\r\nstore of money, goods, and weapons. The Spaniards then assailed\r\nTernate; the fort and plaza were bombarded, and then the town was\r\ncarried by storm.\r\n\r\nThus, at last was accomplished the adventure which for nearly a\r\ncentury had inspired the ambitions of the Spaniards, which had drawn\r\nthe fleet of Magellan, which had wrecked the expeditions of Loyasa and\r\nVillalobos, for which the Spaniards in the Philippines had prepared\r\nexpedition after expedition, and for which Governor Dasmarinas had\r\nsacrificed his life. At last the Moluccas had been taken by the forces\r\nof Spain.\r\n\r\nCapture of a Dutch Fleet at Mariveles.--So far from disposing of\r\ntheir enemies, however, this action simply brought the Dutch into\r\nthe Philippines. In 1609, Juan de Silva became governor of the\r\nIslands and in the same year arrived the Dutch admiral, Wittert,\r\nwith a squadron. After an unsuccessful attack on Iloilo, the Dutch\r\nfleet anchored off Mariveles, to capture vessels arriving for the\r\nManila trade.\r\n\r\nAt this place, on the 25th of April, 1610, the Spanish fleet, which had\r\nbeen hastily fitted at Cavite, attacked the Dutch, killing the admiral\r\nand taking all the ships but one, two hundred and fifty prisoners, and\r\na large amount of silver and merchandise. These prisoners seem to have\r\nbeen treated with more mercy than the captives of Van Noort's fleet,\r\nwho were hung at Cavite. The wounded are said to have been cared for,\r\nand the friars from all the religious orders vied with one another\r\nto convert these \"Protestant pirates\" from their heresy.\r\n\r\nAn Expedition against the Dutch in Java.--Spain made a truce of her\r\nEuropean wars with Holland in 1609, but this cessation of hostilities\r\nwas never recognized in the East. The Dutch and Spanish colonists\r\ncontinued to war upon and pillage each other until late in the\r\ncentury. Encouraged by his victory over Wittert, Silva negotiated with\r\nthe Portuguese allies in Goa, India, to drive the Dutch from Java. A\r\npowerful squadron sailed from Cavite in 1616 for this purpose. It\r\nwas the largest fleet which up to that date had ever been assembled\r\nin the Philippines. The expedition, however, failed to unite with\r\ntheir Portuguese allies, and in April, Silva died at Malacca of\r\nmalignant fever.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Fleets.--Battles near Corregidor.--The fleet returned\r\nto Cavite to find that the city, while stripped of soldiers and\r\nartillery, had been in a fever of anxiety and apprehension over the\r\nproximity of Dutch vessels. They were those of Admiral Spilbergen,\r\nwho had arrived by way of the Straits of Magellan and the Pacific. He\r\nhas left us a chart of the San Bernadino Straits, which is reproduced\r\nhere. Spilbergen bombarded Ilolio and then sailed for the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nA year later he returned, met a Spanish fleet of seven galleons and\r\ntwo galleras near Manila and suffered a severe defeat. [66] The battle\r\nbegan with cannonading on Friday, April 13, and continued throughout\r\nthe day. On the following day the vessels came to close quarters,\r\nthe Spaniards boarded the Dutch vessels, and the battle was fought\r\nout with the sword.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch were overwhelmed. Probably their numbers were few. The\r\nRelacion states they had fourteen galleons, but other accounts put\r\nthe number at ten, three vessels of which were destroyed or taken by\r\nthe Spaniards. One of them, the beautiful ship, \"The Sun of Holland,\"\r\nwas burned. This combat is known as the battle of Playa Honda. Another\r\nengagement took place in the same waters of Corregidor, late in 1624,\r\nwhen a Dutch fleet was driven away without serious loss to either side.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Capture Chinese Junks, and Galleons.--But through\r\nthe intervening years, fleets of the Hollanders were continually\r\narriving, both by the way of the Cape of Good Hope and the Straits\r\nof Magellan. Those that came across the Pacific almost invariably\r\ncruised up the Strait of San Bernadino, securing the fresh provisions\r\nso desirable to them after their long voyage.\r\n\r\nThe prizes which they made of Chinese vessels, passing Corregidor\r\nfor Manila, give us an idea of how considerably the Spaniards in the\r\nPhilippines relied upon China for their food. Junks, or \"champans,\"\r\nwere continually passing Corregidor, laden with chickens, hogs, rice,\r\nsugar, and other comestibles. [67]\r\n\r\nThe Mexican galleons were frequently destroyed or captured by these\r\nlurking fleets of the Dutch, and for a time the route through the\r\nStraits of San Bernadino had to be abandoned, the galleons reaching\r\nManila by way of Cape Engano, or sometimes landing in Cagayan,\r\nand more than once going ashore on the Pacific side of the island,\r\nat Binangonan de Lampon.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch in Formosa.--The Dutch also made repeated efforts to wrest\r\nfrom Portugal her settlement and trade in China. As early as 1557\r\nthe Portuguese had established a settlement on the island of Macao,\r\none of these numerous islets that fill the estuary of the river of\r\nCanton. This is the oldest European settlement in China and has been\r\nheld continuously by the Portuguese until the present day, when it\r\nremains almost the last vestige of the once mighty Portuguese empire\r\nof the East. It was much coveted by the Dutch because of its importance\r\nin the trade with Canton and Fukien.\r\n\r\nIn 1622 a fleet from Java brought siege to Macao, and, being\r\nrepulsed, sailed to the Pescadores Islands, where they built a\r\nfort and established a post, which threatened both the Portuguese\r\ntrade with Japan and the Manila trade with Amoy. Two years later, on\r\nthe solicitation of the Chinese government, the Dutch removed their\r\nsettlement to Formosa, where they broke up the Spanish mission stations\r\nand held the island for the succeeding thirty-five years. Thus,\r\nthroughout the century, these European powers harassed and raided\r\none another, but no one of them was sufficiently strong to expel the\r\nothers from the East.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese Colonies.--In 1640 the kingdom of Portugal freed\r\nitself from the domination of Spain. With the same blow Spain lost\r\nthe great colonial possessions that came to her with the attachment of\r\nthe Portuguese. \"All the places,\" says Zuniga, \"which the Portuguese\r\nhad in the Indies, separated themselves from the crown of Castile and\r\nrecognized as king, Don Juan of Portugal.\" \"This same year,\" he adds,\r\n\"the Dutch took Malacca.\" [68]\r\n\r\nThe Moros.--Increase of Moro Piracy.--During all these years the raids\r\nof the Moros of Maguindanao and Jolo had never ceased. Their piracies\r\nwere almost continuous. There was no security; churches were looted,\r\npriests killed, people borne away for ransom or for slavery. Obviously,\r\nthis piracy could only be met by destroying it at its source. Defensive\r\nfortifications and protective fleets were of no consequence, when\r\ncompared with the necessity of subduing the Moro in his own lairs. In\r\n1628 and 1630 punitive expeditions were sent against Jolo, Basilan, and\r\nMindanao, which drove the Moros from their forts, burned their towns,\r\nand cut down their groves of cocoanut trees. But such expeditions\r\nserved only to inflame the more the wrathful vengeance of the Moro,\r\nand in 1635 the government resolved upon a change of policy and the\r\nestablishment of a presidio at Zamboanga.\r\n\r\nFounding of a Spanish Post at Zamboanga.--This brings us to a new\r\nphase in the Moro wars. The governor, Juan Cerezo de Salamanca,\r\nwas determined upon the conquest and the occupation of Mindanao and\r\nJolo. In taking this step, Salamanca, like Corcuera, who succeeded him,\r\nacted under the influence of the Jesuits. Their missions in Bohol and\r\nnorthern Mindanao made them ambitious to reserve for the ministrations\r\nof their society all lands that were conquered and occupied, south\r\nof the Bisayas.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits were the missionaries on Ternate and Siao and wherever in\r\nthe Moluccas and Celebes the Spanish and Portuguese had established\r\ntheir power. The Jesuits had accompanied the expedition of Rodriguez\r\nde Figueroa in 1595, and from that date they never ceased petitioning\r\nthe government for a military occupation of these islands and for\r\ntheir own return, as the missionaries of these regions. The Jesuits\r\nwere brilliant and able administrators. For men of their ambition,\r\nMindanao, with its rich soil, attractive productions, and comparatively\r\nnumerous populations, was a most enticing field for the establishment\r\nof such a theocratic commonwealth as the Jesuits had created and\r\nadministered in America. [69]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the occupation of Zamboanga was strenuously\r\nopposed by the other religious orders; but the Jesuits, ever\r\nremarkable for their ascendancy in affairs of state, were able to\r\neffect the establishment of Zamboanga, though they could not prevent\r\nits abandonment a quarter of a century later.\r\n\r\nErection of the Forts.--The presidio was founded in 1635, by a force\r\nunder Don Juan de Chaves. His army consisted of three hundred Spaniards\r\nand one thousand Bisaya, The end of the peninsula was swept of Moro\r\ninhabitants and their towns destroyed by fire. In June the foundations\r\nof the stone fort were laid under the direction of the Jesuit, Father\r\nVera, who is described as being experienced in military engineering\r\nand architecture.\r\n\r\nTo supply the new site with water, a ditch was built from the river\r\nTumaga, a distance of six or seven miles, which brought a copious\r\nstream to the very walls of the fort. The advantage or failure of\r\nthis expensive fortress is very hard to determine. Its planting was\r\na partisan measure, and it was always subject to partisan praise\r\nand partisan blame. Sometimes it seemed to have checked the Moros\r\nand sometimes seemed only to be stirring them to fresh anger and\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nThe same year that saw the establishment of Zamboanga, Hortado de\r\nCorcuera became governor of the Philippines. He was much under the\r\ninfluence of the Jesuits and confirmed their policy of conquest.\r\n\r\nDefeat of the Moro Pirate Tagal.--A few months later a notable fleet\r\nof pirates, recruited from Mindanao, Jolo, and Borneo, and headed by\r\na chieftain named Tagal, a brother of the notorious Correlat, sultan\r\nof Maguindanao, went defiantly past the new presidio and northward\r\nthrough the Mindoro Sea. For more than seven months they cruised the\r\nBisayas. The islands of the Camarines especially felt their ravages. In\r\nCuyo they captured the corregidor and three friars. Finally, with\r\n650 captives and rich booty, including the ornaments and services of\r\nchurches, Tagal turned southward on his return.\r\n\r\nThe presidio of Zamboanga had prepared to intercept him and a fierce\r\nbattle took place off the Punta de Flechas, thirty leagues to the\r\nnortheast of Zamboanga. According to the Spanish writers, this point\r\nwas one held sacred by Moro superstitions. A deity inhabited these\r\nwaters, whom the Moros were accustomed to propitiate on the departure\r\nand arrival of their expeditions, by throwing into the sea lances and\r\narrows. The victory was a notable one for the Spanish arms. Tagal\r\nand more than 300 Moros were killed, and 120 Christian captives\r\nwere released.\r\n\r\nCorcuera's Expedition against the Moros at Lamitan.--Corcuera had\r\nmeanwhile been preparing an expedition, which had taken on the\r\ncharacter of a holy war. Jesuit and soldier mingled in its company\r\nand united in its direction. The Jesuit saint, Francis Xavier, was\r\nproclaimed patron of the expedition, and mass was celebrated daily\r\non the ships. Corcuera himself accompanied the expedition, and at\r\nZamboanga, where they arrived February 22, 1637, he united a force\r\nof 760 Spaniards and many Bisayans and Pampangas.\r\n\r\nFrom Zamboanga the force started for Lamitan, the stronghold of\r\nCorrelat, and the center of the power of the Maguindanao. It seems\r\nto have been situated on the coast, south of the region of Lake\r\nLanao. The fleet encountered rough weather and contrary winds off Punta\r\nde Flechas, which they attributed to the influence of the Moro demon.\r\n\r\nTo rid the locality of this unholy influence, Padre Marcello, the\r\nJesuit superior, occupied himself for two days. Padre Combes has left\r\nus an account of the ceremony. [70] The demon was dispossessed by\r\nexorcism. Mass was celebrated. Various articles, representing Moro\r\ninfidelity, including arrows, were destroyed and burnt. Holy relics\r\nwere thrown into the waters, and the place was finally sanctified by\r\nbaptism in the name of Saint Sebastian.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of March the expedition reached Lamitan, fortified and\r\ndefended by two thousand Moro warriors. The Spanish force, however,\r\nwas overwhelming, and the city was taken by storm. Here were captured\r\neight bronze cannon, twenty-seven \"versos\" (a kind of small howitzer),\r\nand over a hundred muskets and arquebuses and a great store of Moro\r\nweapons. Over one hundred vessels were destroyed, including a fleet\r\nof Malay merchant praos from Java. Sixteen villages were burned, and\r\nseventy-two Moros were hung. Correlat, though pursued and wounded,\r\nwas not captured. [71]\r\n\r\nThe Conquest of Jolo.--Corcuera returned to Zamboanga and organized an\r\nexpedition for the conquest of Jolo. Although defended by four thousand\r\nMoro warriors and by allies from Basilan and the Celebes, Corcuera took\r\nJolo after some months of siege. The sultan saved himself by flight,\r\nbut the sultana was taken prisoner. Corcuera reconstructed the fort,\r\nestablished a garrison of two hundred Spaniards and an equal number\r\nof Pampangas, left some Jesuit fathers, and, having nominated Major\r\nAlmonte chief of all the forces in the south, returned in May, 1638,\r\nto Manila, with all the triumph of a conqueror.\r\n\r\nAlmonte continued the work of subjugation. In 1639 he conquered the\r\nMoro dato of Buhayen, in the valley of the Rio Grande, where a small\r\npresidio was founded. And in the same year the Jesuits prevailed upon\r\nhim to invade the territory of the Malanao, now known as the Laguna\r\nde Lanao. This expedition was made from the north through Iligan,\r\nand for a time brought even this warlike and difficult territory\r\nunder the authority of the governor and the spiritual administration\r\nof the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nLoss of the Spanish Settlement on Formosa.--The full military success\r\nof Corcuera's governorship was marred by the loss of Macao and the\r\ncapture of the Spanish settlement on the island of Formosa by the\r\nDutch. In the attempt to hold Macao, Corcuera sent over the encomendero\r\nof Pasig, Don Juan Claudio. The populace of Macao, however, rose in\r\ntumult, assassinated the governor, Sebastian Lobo, and pronounced in\r\nfavor of Portugal. Later, by decree of the Portuguese governor of Goa,\r\nall the Spanish residents and missionaries were expelled. The Dutch\r\nseizure of Formosa, a year later, has already been described.\r\n\r\nThe Archipelago and the Religious Orders.--During these decades,\r\nconflict was almost incessant between the archbishop of Manila and\r\nthe regular orders. In the Philippines the regulars were the parish\r\ncurates, and the archbishop desired that all matters of their curacy,\r\ntouching the administration of the sacraments and other parish duties,\r\nshould be subject to the direction of the bishops. This question of\r\nthe \"diocesan visit\" was fought over for nearly two hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and the Archbishop.--Even more serious to the colony\r\nwere the conflicts that raged between the governor-general and the\r\narchbishop. All the points of dissension between Church and State,\r\nwhich vexed the Middle Ages, broke out afresh in the Philippines. The\r\nappointment of religious officers; the distribution of revenue; the\r\ntreatment of the natives; the claim of the church to offer asylum to\r\nthose fleeing the arm of the law; its claims of jurisdiction, in its\r\necclesiastical courts, over a large class of civil offenses--these\r\ndisputes and many others, occasioned almost incessant discord between\r\nthe heads of civil and ecclesiastical authority.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Residencia.\"--We have seen that the power of the governor was\r\nin fact very large. Theoretically, the Audiencia was a limit upon\r\nhis authority; but in fact the governor was usually the president of\r\nthis body, and the oidores were frequently his abettors and rarely\r\nhis opponents. At the end of each governor's rule there took place a\r\ncharacteristic Spanish institution, called the \"Residencia.\" This was\r\na court held by the newly elected governor, for an examination into\r\nthe conduct of his predecessor. Complaints of every description were\r\nreceived, and often, in the history of the Philippines, one who had\r\nruled the archipelago almost as an independent monarch found himself,\r\nat the end of his office, ruined, and in chains.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the occasion of the Residencia that the ecclesiastical\r\npowers, after a governorship stormy with disputes, exercised their\r\npower for revenge. Unquestionably many a governor, despite his actual\r\npower, facing, as he did, the Residencia at the termination of his\r\nrule, made peace with his enemies and yielded to their demands.\r\n\r\nCorcuera had continuous troubles with the archbishop and with the\r\nreligious orders other than the Jesuits. In 1644, when his successor,\r\nFajardo, relieved him, the Franciscans, Augustinians, and Recollects\r\nprocured his imprisonment and the confiscation of his property. For\r\nfive years, the conqueror of the Moros lay a prisoner in the fortresses\r\nof Santiago and Cavite, when he was pardoned by the Council of the\r\nIndies, and appointed governor of the Canaries by the king.\r\n\r\nWeakening of the Governor's Power.--This power of private and\r\nreligious classes to intimidate and overawe the responsible head of the\r\nPhilippine government was an abuse which continued to the very close\r\nof the Spanish rule. This, together with the relatively short term of\r\nthe governor's office, his natural desire to avoid trouble, his all\r\ntoo frequent purpose of amassing a fortune rather than maintaining the\r\ndignity of his position and advancing the interests of the Islands,\r\ncombined decade after decade to make the spiritual authority more\r\npowerful. In the end the religious orders, with their great body of\r\nmembers, their hold upon the Filipinos, their high influence at the\r\ncourt, and finally their great landed wealth, governed the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe Educational Work of the Religious Orders.--In any criticism of\r\nthe evils connected with their administration of the Philippines,\r\none must not fail to recognize the many achievements of the missionary\r\nfriars that were worthy. To the Dominicans and the Jesuits is due the\r\nestablishment of institutions of learning. The Jesuits in 1601 had\r\nplanted their College of San Jose. The Dominicans, here as in Europe,\r\nthe champions of orthodox learning, had their own institution, the\r\nCollege of Santo Tomas, inaugurated in 1619, and were the rivals of\r\nthe Jesuits for the privilege of giving higher instruction.\r\n\r\nIn 1645 the pope granted to the Dominicans the right to bestow higher\r\ndegrees, and their college became the \"Royal and Pontifical University\r\nof Saint Thomas Aquinas.\" This splendid name breathes that very spirit\r\nof the Middle Ages which the Dominican order strove to perpetuate in\r\nthe Philippines down to modern days. [72] Dominicans also founded\r\nthe College of San Juan de Letran, as a preparatory school to the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nWe should not pass over the educational work of the religious\r\norders without mention of the early printing-plants and their\r\npublications. The missionary friars were famous printers, and in the\r\nPhilippines, as well as in America, some noble volumes were produced\r\nby their handicraft.\r\n\r\nFounding of Hospitals by the Franciscans.--Nor had the Franciscans\r\nin the Philippines neglected the fundamental purpose of their\r\nfoundation,--that of ministration to the sick and unprotected. A\r\nnarrative of their order, written in 1649, gives a long list of their\r\nbeneficent foundations. [73] Besides the hospital of Manila, they\r\nhad an infirmary at Cavite for the native mariners and shipbuilders,\r\na hospital at Los Banos, another in the city of Nueva Caceras. Lay\r\nbrethren were attached to many of the convents as nurses.\r\n\r\nIn 1633 a curious occurrence led to the founding of the leper hospital\r\nof San Lazaro. The emperor of Japan, in a probably ironical mood,\r\nsent to Manila a shipload of Japanese afflicted with this unfortunate\r\ndisease. These people were mercifully received by the Franciscans, and\r\ncared for in a home, which became the San Lazaro hospital for lepers.\r\n\r\nLife and Progress of the Filipinos.--Few sources exist that can\r\nshow us the life and progress of the Filipino people during these\r\ndecades. Christianity, as introduced by the missionary friars,\r\nwas wonderfully successful, and yet there were relapses into\r\nheathenism. Old religious leaders and priestesses roused up from\r\ntime to time, and incited the natives to rebellion against their new\r\nspiritual masters. The payment of tribute and the labor required for\r\nthe building of churches often drove the people into the mountains.\r\n\r\nReligious Revolt at Bohol and Leyte.--In 1621 a somewhat serious\r\nrevolt took place on Bohol. The Jesuits who administered the island\r\nwere absent in Cebu, attending the fiestas on the canonization\r\nof Saint Francis Xavier. The whisper was raised that the old\r\nheathen deity, Diwata, was at hand to assist in the expulsion of\r\nthe Spaniards. The island rose in revolt, except the two towns of\r\nLoboc and Baclayan. Four towns were burned, the churches sacked, and\r\nthe sacred images speared. The revolt spread to Leyte, where it was\r\nheaded by the old dato, Bancao of Limasaua, who had sworn friendship\r\nwith Legaspi. This insurrection was put down by the alcalde mayor of\r\nCebu and the Filipino leaders were hung. On Leyte, Bancao was speared\r\nin battle, and one of the heathen priests suffered the penalty,\r\nprescribed by the Inquisition for heresy--death by burning.\r\n\r\nRevolt of the Pampangas.--The heavy drafting of natives to fell trees\r\nand build the ships for the Spanish naval expeditions and the Acapulco\r\ntrade was also a cause for insurrection. In 1660 a thousand Pampangas\r\nwere kept cutting in the forests of that province alone. Sullen at\r\ntheir heavy labor and at the harshness of their overseers, these\r\nnatives rose in revolt. The sedition spread to Pangasinan, Zambales,\r\nand Ilocos, and it required the utmost efforts of the Spanish forces\r\non land and water to suppress the rebellion.\r\n\r\nUprising of the Chinese.--In spite of the terrible massacre, that had\r\nbeen visited upon the Chinese at the beginning of the century, they\r\nhad almost immediately commenced returning not only as merchants, but\r\nas colonists. The early restrictions upon their life must have been\r\nrelaxed, for in 1639 there were more than thirty thousand living in\r\nthe Islands, many of them cultivating lands at Calamba and at other\r\npoints on the Laguna de Bay.\r\n\r\nIn that year a rebellion broke out, in which the Chinese in Manila\r\nparticipated. They seized the church of San Pedro Mecati, on the Pasig,\r\nand fortified themselves. From there they were routed by a combined\r\nFilipino and Spanish force. The Chinese then broke up into small\r\nbands, which scattered through the country, looting and murdering,\r\nbut being pursued and cut to pieces by the Filipinos. For five months\r\nthis pillage and massacre went on, until seven thousand Chinese were\r\ndestroyed. By the loss of these agriculturists and laborers Manila\r\nwas reduced to great distress.\r\n\r\nActivity of the Moro Pirates.--The task of the Spaniards in controlling\r\nthe Moro datos continued to be immensely difficult. During the years\r\nfollowing the successes of Corcuera and Almonte, the Moros were\r\ncontinually plotting. Aid was furnished from Borneo and the Celebes,\r\nand they were further incited by the Dutch. In spite of the vigilance\r\nof Zamboanga, small piratical excursions continually harassed the\r\nBisayas and the Camarines.\r\n\r\nContinued Conflicts with the Dutch.--The Dutch, too, from time to time\r\nshowed themselves in Manila. In 1646 a squadron attacked Zamboanga,\r\nand then came north to Luzon. The Spanish naval strength was quite\r\nunprepared; but two galleons, lately arrived from Acapulco, were\r\nfitted with heavy guns, Dominican friars took their places among\r\nthe gunners, and, under the protection of the Virgin of the Rosary,\r\nsuccessfully encountered the enemy.\r\n\r\nA year later a fleet of twelve vessels entered Manila Bay, and nearly\r\nsucceeded in taking Cavite. Failing in this, they landed in Bataan\r\nprovince, and for some time held the coast of Manila Bay in the\r\nvicinity of Abucay. The narrative of Franciscan missions in 1649,\r\nabove cited, gives town after town in southern Luzon, where church\r\nand convent had been burned by the Moros or the Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe Abandonment of Zamboanga and the Moluccas.--The threat of the Dutch\r\nmade the maintenance of the presidio of Zamboanga very burdensome. In\r\n1656 the administration of the Moluccas was united with that of\r\nMindanao, and the governor of the former, Don Francisco de Esteybar,\r\nwas transferred from Ternate to Zamboanga and made lieutenant-governor\r\nand captain-general of all the provinces of the south.\r\n\r\nSix years later, the Moluccas, so long coveted by the Spaniards, and so\r\nslowly won by them, together with Zamboanga, were wholly abandoned, and\r\nto the Spice Islands the Spaniards were never to return. This sudden\r\nretirement from their southern possessions was not, however, occasioned\r\nby the incessant restlessness of the Moros nor by the plottings of\r\nthe Dutch. It was due to a threat of danger from the north.\r\n\r\nKoxinga the Chinese Adventurer.--In 1644, China was conquered by the\r\nManchus. Pekin capitulated at once and the Ming dynasty was overthrown,\r\nbut it was only by many years of fighting that the Manchus overcame\r\nthe Chinese of the central and southern provinces. These were years\r\nof turbulence, revolt, and piracy.\r\n\r\nMore than one Chinese adventurer rose to a romantic position during\r\nthis disturbed time. One of these adventurers, named It Coan, had been\r\na poor fisherman of Chio. He had lived in Macao, where he had been\r\nconverted to Christianity, and had been a cargador, or cargo-bearer,\r\nin Manila. He afterwards went to Japan, and engaged in trade. From\r\nthese humble and laborious beginnings, like many another of his\r\npersistent countrymen, he gained great wealth, which on the conquest\r\nof the Manchus he devoted to piracy.\r\n\r\nHis son was the notorious Kue-Sing, or Koxinga, who for years resisted\r\nthe armies of the Manchus, and maintained an independent power over\r\nthe coasts of Fukien and Chekiang. About 1660 the forces of the Manchus\r\nbecame too formidable for him to longer resist them upon the mainland,\r\nand Koxinga determined upon the capture of Formosa and the transference\r\nof his kingdom to that island.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-eight years this island had been dominated by the Dutch,\r\nwhose fortresses commanded the channel of the Pescadores. The colony\r\nwas regarded as an important one by the Dutch colonial government at\r\nBatavia. The city of Tai-wan, on the west coast, was a considerable\r\ncenter of trade. It was strongly protected by the fortress of Zealand,\r\nand had a garrison of twenty-two hundred Dutch soldiers. After months\r\nof fighting, Koxinga, with an overpowering force of Chinese, compelled\r\nthe surrender of the Hollanders and the beautiful island passed into\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\nA Threatened Invasion of the Philippines.--Exalted by his success\r\nagainst European arms, Koxinga resolved upon the conquest of\r\nthe Philippines. He summoned to his service the Italian Dominican\r\nmissionary, Ricci, who had been living in the province of Fukien, and\r\nin the spring of 1662 dispatched him as an ambassador to the governor\r\nof the Philippines to demand the submission of the archipelago.\r\n\r\nManila was thrown into a terrible panic by this demand, and indeed\r\nno such danger had threatened the Spanish in the Philippines since\r\nthe invasion of Limahong. The Chinese conqueror had an innumerable\r\narmy, and his armament, stores, and navy had been greatly augmented\r\nby the surrender of the Dutch. The Spaniards, however, were united\r\non resistance. The governor, Don Sabiano Manrique de Lara, returned a\r\ndefiant answer to Koxinga, and the most radical measures were adopted\r\nto place the colony in a state of defense.\r\n\r\nAll Chinese were ordered immediately to leave the Islands. Fearful\r\nof massacre, these wretched people again broke out in rebellion,\r\nand assaulted the city. Many were slain, and other bands wandered\r\noff into the mountains, where they perished at the hands of the\r\nnatives. Others, escaping by frail boats, joined the Chinese colonists\r\non Formosa. Churches and convents in the suburbs of Manila, which might\r\nafford shelter to the assailant, were razed to the ground. More than\r\nall this, the Moluccas were forsaken, never again to be recovered by\r\nSpaniards; and the presidios of Zamboanga and Cuyo, which served as a\r\nkind of bridle on the Moros of Jolo and Mindanao, were abandoned. All\r\nSpanish troops were concentrated in Manila, fortifications were\r\nrebuilt, and the population waited anxiously for the attack. But the\r\nblow never fell. Before Ricci arrived at Tai-wan, Koxinga was dead,\r\nand the peril of Chinese invasion had passed.\r\n\r\nEffects of These Events.--But the Philippines had suffered\r\nirretrievable loss. Spanish prestige was gone. Manila was no longer,\r\nas she had been at the commencement of the century, the capital of\r\nthe East. Spanish sovereignty was again confined to Luzon and the\r\nBisayas. The Chinese trade, on which rested the economic prosperity\r\nof Manila, had once again been ruined. For a hundred years the history\r\nof the Philippines is a dull monotony, quite unrelieved by any heroic\r\nactivity or the presence of noble character. [74]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nA CENTURY OF OBSCURITY AND DECLINE. 1663-1762.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Decline of the Philippines.--For the hundred years succeeding\r\nthe abandonment of the Moluccas, the Philippines lost all political\r\nsignificance as a colony. From almost every standpoint they were\r\nprofitless to Spain. There were continued deficits, which had to be\r\nmade good from the Mexican treasury. The part of Spain in the conquest\r\nof the East was over, and the Philippines became little more than a\r\ngreat missionary establishment, presided over by the religious orders.\r\n\r\nDeath of Governor Salcedo by the Inquisition.--In 1663, Lara was\r\nsucceeded by Don Diego de Salcedo. On his arrival, Manila had high\r\nhopes of him, which were speedily disappointed. He loaded the Acapulco\r\ngalleon with his own private merchandise, and then dispatched it\r\nearlier than was usual, before the cargoes of the merchants were\r\nready. He engaged in a wearisome strife with the archbishop, and\r\nseems to have worried the ecclesiastic, who was aged and feeble,\r\ninto his grave. At the end of a few years he was hated by every one,\r\nand a conspiracy against him was formed which embraced the religious,\r\nthe army, the civil officials, and the merchants. Beyond the reach of\r\nthe power of ordinary plotters, he fell a victim to the commissioner\r\nof the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Inquisition, which wrought such cruelty and misery in the\r\nPeninsula, was carried also to the Spanish colonies. As we have seen,\r\nit was primarily the function of the Dominican order to administer\r\nthe institution. The powers exercised by an inquisitor can scarcely\r\nbe understood at the present day. His methods were secret, the\r\ncharges were not made public, the whole proceedings were closeted,\r\nand yet so great were the powers of this court that none could\r\nresist its authority, or inquire into its actions. Spain forbade\r\nany heretics, Jews, or Moors going to the colonies, and did the\r\nutmost to prevent heresy abroad. She also established in America the\r\nInquisition itself. Fortunately, it never attained the importance in\r\nthe Philippines that it had in Spain. In the Philippines there was no\r\n\"Tribunal,\" the institution being represented solely by a commissioner.\r\n\r\nDeath of the Governor.--In 1667, when the unpopularity of Governor\r\nSalcedo was at its height, this commissioner professed to discover in\r\nhim grounds of heresy from the fact that he had been born in Flanders,\r\nand decided to avenge the Church by encompassing his ruin. By secret\r\narrangement, the master of the camp withdrew the guard from the palace,\r\nand the commissioner, with several confederates, gained admission. The\r\ndoor of the governor's room was opened by an old woman, who had been\r\nterrified into complicity, and the governor was seized sleeping,\r\nwith his arms lying at the head of his bed.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner informed the governor that he was a prisoner of the\r\nHoly Office. He was taken to the convent of the Augustinians. Here he\r\nwas kept in chains until he could be sent to Mexico, to appear before\r\nthe Tribunal there. The government in Mexico annulled the arrest of\r\nthe commissioner, but Salcedo died at sea on the return of the vessel\r\nto the Philippines in 1669.\r\n\r\nColonization of the Ladrone Islands.--In 1668 a Jesuit mission under\r\nPadre Diego Luis de Sanvitores was established on the Ladrones, the\r\nfirst of the many mission stations, both Roman Catholic and Protestant,\r\nin the South Pacific. The islands at that time were well populated\r\nand fertile, and had drawn the enthusiasm of Padre Sanvitores in 1662\r\nwhen he first sailed to the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe hostility of the Manchus in China, the Japanese persecutions,\r\nand the abandonment of Mindanao had closed many mission fields,\r\nand explains the eagerness with which the Jesuits sought the royal\r\npermission to Christianize these islands, which had been so constantly\r\nvisited by Spanish ships but never before colonized. With Padre\r\nSanvitores and his five Jesuit associates were a number of Christian\r\nFilipino catechists.\r\n\r\nSettlement of Guam.--The mission landed at Guam, and was favorably\r\nreceived. Society among these islanders was divided into castes. The\r\nchiefs were known as chamorri, which has led to the natives of the\r\nLadrones being called \"Chamorros.\" A piece of ground was given the\r\nJesuits for a church at the principal town called Agadna (Agana), and\r\nhere also a seminary was built for the instruction of young men. The\r\nqueen regent of Spain, Maria of Austria, gave an annual sum to this\r\nschool, and in her honor the Jesuits changed the name of the islands\r\nto the Marianas. The Jesuits preached on eleven inhabited islands\r\nof the group, and in a year's time had baptized thirteen thousand\r\nislanders and given instruction to twenty thousand.\r\n\r\nTroubles with the Natives at Guam.--This first year was the most\r\nsuccessful in the history of the mission. Almost immediately after,\r\nthe Jesuits angered the islanders by compulsory conversions. There were\r\nquarrels in several places, and priests, trying to baptize children\r\nagainst the wishes of their parents, were killed. In 1670 the Spaniards\r\nwere attacked, and obliged to fortify themselves at Agana.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits had a guard of a Spanish captain and about thirty Spanish\r\nand Filipino soldiers, who, after some slaughter of the natives,\r\ncompelled them to sue for peace. The conditions imposed by the Jesuits\r\nwere that the natives should attend mass and festivals, have their\r\nchildren baptized, and send them to be catechised. The hatred of the\r\nnatives was unabated, however, and in 1672 Sanvitores was killed by\r\nthem. His biographer claims that at his death he had baptized nearly\r\nfifty thousand of these islanders. [75]\r\n\r\nDepopulation of the Ladrone Islands.--About 1680 a governor was\r\nsent to the islands, and they were organized as a dependency of\r\nSpain. The policy of the governors and the Jesuits was conversion by\r\nthe sword. The natives were persecuted from island to island, and in\r\nthe history of European settlements there is hardly one that had more\r\nmiserable consequences to the inhabitants. Disease was introduced and\r\nswept off large numbers. Others fell resisting the Spaniards, and an\r\nentire island was frequently depopulated by order of the governor, or\r\nthe desire of the Jesuits to have the natives brought to Guam. Many,\r\nwith little doubt, fled to other archipelagoes.\r\n\r\nIf we can trust the Jesuit accounts, there were in the whole group one\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants when the Spaniards arrived. A generation\r\nsaw them almost extinct. Dampier, who touched at Guam in 1686, says\r\nthen that on the island, where the Spaniards had found thirty thousand\r\npeople, there were not above one hundred natives. In 1716 and 1721\r\nother voyagers announced the number of inhabitants on Guam at two\r\nthousand, but only one other island of the group was populated. When\r\nAnson in 1742 visited Guam, the number had risen to four thousand,\r\nand there were a few hundred inhabitants on Rota; but these seem\r\nto have been the whole population. The original native population\r\ncertainly very nearly touched extinction. The islands were from time\r\nto time colonized from the Philippines, and the present population\r\nis very largely of Filipino blood.\r\n\r\nConflicts between Governor and Archbishop.--Meanwhile, in the\r\nPhilippines the conflict of the governor with the archbishop and\r\nthe friars continued. The conduct of both sides was selfish and\r\noutrageous. In 1683 the actions of Archbishop Pardo became so violent\r\nand seditious that the Audiencia decreed his banishment to Pangasinan\r\nor Cagayan. He was taken by force to Lingayan, where he was well\r\naccommodated but kept under surveillance. The Dominicans retaliated by\r\nexcommunication, and the Audiencia thereupon banished the provincial of\r\nthe order from the Islands, and sent several other friars to Mariveles.\r\n\r\nBut the year following, Governor Vargas was relieved by the arrival\r\nof his successor, who was favorable to the ecclesiastical side of\r\nthe controversy. The archbishop returned and assumed a high hand. He\r\nsuspended and excommunicated on all sides. The oidores were banished\r\nfrom the city, and all died in exile in remote portions of the\r\narchipelago. The ex-governor-general, Vargas, being placed under\r\nthe spiritual ban, sued for pardon and begged that his repentance\r\nbe recognized.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop sentenced him to stand daily for the space of four\r\nmonths at the entrances to the churches of the city and of the Parian,\r\nand in the thronged quarter of Binondo, attired in the habit of a\r\npenitent, with a rope about his neck and carrying a lighted candle\r\nin his hand. He was, however, able to secure a mitigation of this\r\nsentence, but was required to live absolutely alone in a hut on an\r\nisland in the Pasig River. He was sent a prisoner to Mexico in 1689,\r\nbut died upon the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe various deans and canons who had concurred in the archbishop's\r\nbanishment, as well as other religious with whom the prelate had had\r\ndissensions, were imprisoned or exiled. The bodies of two oidores\r\nwere, on their death and after their burial, disinterred and their\r\nbones profaned.\r\n\r\nDegeneration of the Colony under Church Rule.--Archbishop Pardo\r\ndied in 1689, but the strife and confusion which had been engendered\r\ncontinued. There were quarrels between the archbishop and the friars,\r\nbetween the prelate and the governor. All classes seem to have shared\r\nthe bitterness and the hatred of these unhappy dissensions.\r\n\r\nThe moral tone of the whole colony during the latter part of the\r\nseventeenth century was lowered. Corruption flourished everywhere,\r\nand the vigor of the administration decayed. Violence went unrebuked,\r\nand the way was open for the deplorable tragedy in which this strife of\r\nparties culminated. Certainly no governor could have been more supine,\r\nand shown greater incapacity and weakness of character, than the one\r\nwho ruled in the time of Archbishop Pardo and those that succeeded him.\r\n\r\nImprovements Made by Governor Bustamante.--Enrichment of the\r\nTreasury.--In the year 1717, however, came a governor of a different\r\ntype, Fernando Manuel de Bustamante. He was an old soldier, stern of\r\ncharacter and severe in his measures. He found the treasury robbed\r\nand exhausted. Nearly the whole population of Manila were in debt\r\nto the public funds. Bustamante ordered these amounts paid, and to\r\ncompel their collection he attached the cargo of silver arriving\r\nby the galleon from Acapulco. This cargo was owned by the religious\r\ncompanies, officials, and merchants, all of whom were indebted to the\r\ngovernment. In one year of his vigorous administration he raised the\r\nsum of three hundred thousand pesos for the treasury.\r\n\r\nWith sums of money again at the disposal of the state, Bustamante\r\nattempted to revive the decayed prestige and commerce of the Islands.\r\n\r\nRefounding of Zamboanga.--In 1718 he refounded and rebuilt the\r\npresidio of Zamboanga. Not a year had passed, since its abandonment\r\nyears before, that the pirates from Borneo and Mindanao had failed\r\nto ravage the Bisayas. The Jesuits had petitioned regularly for its\r\nreestablishment, and in 1712 the king had decreed its reoccupation. The\r\ncitadel was rebuilt on an elaborate plan under the direction of the\r\nengineer, Don Juan Sicarra. Besides the usual barracks, storehouses,\r\nand arsenals, there were, within the walls, a church, hospital, and\r\ncuartel for the Pampangan soldiers. Sixty-one cannon were mounted upon\r\nthe defenses. Upon the petition of the Recollects, Bustamante also\r\nestablished a presidio at Labo, at the southern point of the island of\r\nParagua, whose coasts were attacked by the Moros from Sulu and Borneo.\r\n\r\nTreaty with Siam.--In the same year he sent an embassy to Siam,\r\nwith the idea of stimulating the commerce which had flourished a\r\ncentury before. The reception of this embassy was most flattering;\r\na treaty of peace, friendship, and commerce was made, and on ground\r\nceded to the Spaniards was begun the erection of a factory.\r\n\r\nImprovements in the City of Manila.--How far this brave and\r\ndetermined man might have revived the colony it is impossible to\r\nsay. The population of Manila, both ecclesiastical and civil, was at\r\nthis time so sunk in corruption and so degenerate as to make almost\r\nimpossible any recuperation except under the rule of a man equally\r\ndetermined as Bustamante, but ruling for a long period of time. He\r\nhad not hesitated to order investigations into the finances of the\r\nIslands, which disclosed defalcations amounting to seven hundred\r\nthousand pesos. He fearlessly arrested the defaulters, no matter what\r\ntheir station. The whole city was concerned in these peculations,\r\nconsequently the utmost fear and apprehension existed on all sides;\r\nand Bustamante, hated as well as dreaded, was compelled to enforce\r\nhis reforms single-handed.\r\n\r\nHis Murder.--He was opposed by the friars and defied by the archbishop,\r\nbut, notwithstanding ecclesiastical condemnation, he went to the point\r\nof ordering the arrest of the prelate. The city rose in sedition,\r\nand a mob, headed by friars, proceeded to the palace of the governor,\r\nbroke in upon him, and, as he faced them alone and without support,\r\nkilled him in cold blood (October 11, 1719).\r\n\r\nThe archbishop proclaimed himself governor and president of the\r\nAudiencia. The oidores and officials who had been placed under\r\narrest by Bustamante were released, and his work overthrown. The new\r\ngovernment had neither the courage nor the inclination to continue\r\nBustamante's policy, and in 1720 the archbishop called a council of\r\nwar, which decreed the abandonment of the fort at Labo.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this murder reached Spain, the king ordered an\r\ninvestigation and the punishment of the guilty, and in 1721 Governor\r\nTorre Campo arrived to put these mandates into execution. The culprits,\r\nhowever, were so high and so influential that the governor did not\r\ndare proceed against them; and although the commands of the king were\r\nreiterated in 1724, the assassins of Bustamante were never brought\r\nto justice.\r\n\r\nTreaty with the Sultan of Jolo.--In spite of the cowardly policy\r\nof the successors of Bustamante, the presidio of Zamboanga was not\r\nabandoned. So poorly was it administered, however, that it was not\r\neffective to prevent Moro piracy, and the attacks upon the Bisaya and\r\nCalamianes continued. In 1721 a treaty was formed with the sultan of\r\nJolo providing for trade between Manila and Jolo, the return or ransom\r\nof captives, and the restitution to Spain of the island of Basilan.\r\n\r\nThe Moro Pirates of Tawi Tawi.--To some extent this treaty seems to\r\nhave prevented assaults from Jolo, but in 1730 the Moros of Tawi Tawi\r\nfell upon Paragua and the Calamianes, and in 1731 another expedition\r\nfrom the south spent nearly a whole year cruising and destroying\r\namong the Bisayas.\r\n\r\nDeplorable State of Spanish Defenses.--The defenses of the Spaniards\r\nduring these many decades were continually in a deplorable state, their\r\narms were wretched, and, except in moments of great apprehension,\r\nno attention was given to fortifications, to the preservation of\r\nartillery, nor to the supply of ammunition. Sudden attacks ever\r\nfound the Spaniards unprepared. Military unreadiness was the normal\r\ncondition of this archipelago from these early centuries down to the\r\ndestruction of the Spanish armament by the American fleet.\r\n\r\nThe Economic Policy of Spain.--Restrictions of Trade.--During the\r\nclosing years of the seventeenth century and the beginning of the\r\neighteenth, commerce seemed to have been actually paralyzed. That\r\nbrilliant trade which is described by Morga, and which was at its\r\nheight about 1605, was a few years later defeated by the miserable\r\neconomic policy of Spain, pandering to the demands of the merchants\r\nof Cadiz and Seville.\r\n\r\nSpain's economic policy had only in view benefits to the\r\nPeninsula. \"The Laws of the Indies\" abound with edicts for the purpose\r\nof limiting and crippling colonial commerce and industry, wherever it\r\nwas imagined that it might be prejudicial to the protected industries\r\nof Spain. The manufacturers of Seville wished to preserve the colonies,\r\nboth of America and of the Indies, as markets for their monopoly wares;\r\nand in this policy, for two centuries, they had the support of the\r\ncrown. The growing trade between Mexico and the Philippines had early\r\nbeen regarded with suspicion, and legislation was framed to reduce\r\nit to the lowest point compatible with the existence of the colony.\r\n\r\nNone of the colonies of America could conduct commerce with the\r\nPhilippines except Mexico, and here all communication must pass\r\nthrough the port of Acapulco. This trade was limited to the passage\r\nof a single vessel a year. In 1605 two galleons were permitted, but\r\ntheir size was reduced to three hundred tons. They were allowed to\r\ncarry out 500,000 pesos of silver, but no more than 250,000 pesos'\r\nworth of Chinese products could be returned. Neither the Spaniards\r\nof Mexico nor any part of America could traffic directly with China,\r\nnor could Spanish vessels pass from Manila to the ports of Asia. Only\r\nthose goods could be bought which Chinese merchants themselves brought\r\nto the Philippines.\r\n\r\nSelfishness of Merchants in Spain.--Even these restrictions did\r\nnot satisfy the jealousy of the merchants of Spain. They complained\r\nthat the royal orders limiting the traffic were not regarded, and\r\nthey insisted upon so vexatious a supervision of this commerce,\r\nand surrounded infractions of the law with such terrible penalties,\r\nthat the trade was not maintained even to the amount permitted by\r\nlaw. Spanish merchants even went to the point of petitioning for the\r\nabandonment of the Philippines, on the ground that the importations\r\nfrom China were prejudicial to the industry of the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe colonists upon the Pacific coast of America suffered from the\r\nlack of those commodities demanded by civilized life, which could\r\nonly reach them as they came from Spain through the port of Porto\r\nBello and the Isthmus of Panama. Without question, an enormous and\r\nbeneficial commerce could have been conducted by the Philippines with\r\nthe provinces of western America. [76]\r\n\r\nTrade Between South America and the Philippines Forbidden.--But this\r\ntraffic was absolutely forbidden, and to prevent Chinese and Philippine\r\ngoods from entering South America, the trade between Mexico and Peru\r\nwas in 1636 wholly suppressed by a decree. This decree, as it stands\r\nupon the pages of the great Recopilacion, is an epitome of the insane\r\neconomic policy of the Spaniard. It cites that whereas \"it had been\r\npermitted that from Peru to New Spain there should go each year two\r\nvessels for commerce and traffic to the amount of two hundred thousand\r\nducats [which later had been reduced to one hundred thousand ducats],\r\nand because there had increased in Peru to an excessive amount the\r\ncommerce in the fabrics of China, in spite of the many prohibitions\r\nthat had been imposed, and in order absolutely to remove the occasion\r\nfor the future, we order and command the officers of Peru and New\r\nSpain that they invariably prohibit and suppress this commerce and\r\ntraffic between the two kingdoms by all the channels through which\r\nit is conducted, maintaining this prohibition firmly and continually\r\nfor the future.\" [77]\r\n\r\nIn 1718 the merchants of Seville and Cadiz still complained that their\r\nprofits were being injured by even the limited importation of Chinese\r\nsilks into Mexico. Thereupon absolute prohibition of import of Chinese\r\nsilks, either woven or in thread, was decreed. Only linens, spices,\r\nand supplies of such things as were not produced in Spain could be\r\nbrought into Mexico. This order was reaffirmed in 1720, with the\r\nprovision that six months would be allowed the people of Mexico to\r\nconsume the Chinese silks which they had in their possession, and\r\nthereafter all such goods must be destroyed.\r\n\r\nIneffectiveness of These Restrictions.--These measures, while ruining\r\nthe commerce of the Philippines, were as a matter of fact ineffective\r\nto accomplish the result desired. Contraband trade between China\r\nand America sprang up in violation of the law. Silks to the value\r\nof four million pesos were annually smuggled into America. [78] In\r\n1734 the folly and uselessness of such laws was somewhat recognized\r\nby the Council of the Indies, and a cedula was issued restoring the\r\npermission to trade in Chinese silks and raising the value of cargoes\r\ndestined for Acapulco to five hundred thousand pesos, and the quantity\r\nof silver for return to one million pesos. The celebrated traffic of\r\nthe galleon was resumed and continued until the year 1815.\r\n\r\nAn Attempt to Colonize the Carolines.--Southeastward of the\r\nPhilippines, in that part of the Pacific which is known as Micronesia,\r\nthere is an archipelago of small islands called the Carolines. The\r\nwesternmost portion of the group also bear the name of the Pelews,\r\nor Palaos. Inasmuch as these islands were eventually acquired by\r\nSpain and remained in her possession down to the year 1898, it may\r\nbe well to state something at this time of the attempt made by the\r\nJesuits in 1731 to colonize them.\r\n\r\nCertain of these little islands were seen several times by expeditions\r\ncrossing the Pacific as early as the latter part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, but after the trade between Mexico and the Philippines had\r\nbeen definitely settled upon, a fixed course was followed westward\r\nfrom Acapulco to Guam, from which there was little variation, and\r\nduring the seventeenth century these islands passed quite out of mind;\r\nbut in the year 1696 a party of natives, twenty men and ten women,\r\nwere driven by storms far from their home in the Carolines upon the\r\neastern coast of Samar. It seems that similar parties of castaways\r\nfrom the Pelew and Caroline Islands had been known to reach Mindanao\r\nand other parts of the Philippines at an even earlier date. These\r\nlast came under the observation of the Jesuit priests on Samar, who\r\nbaptized them, and, learning from them of the archipelago from which\r\nthey had been carried, were filled with missionary ambition to visit\r\nand Christianize these Pacific islanders.\r\n\r\nThis idea was agitated by the Jesuits, until about 1730 royal\r\npermission was granted to the enterprise. A company of Jesuits in\r\nthe following year sailed for the Ladrones and thence south until\r\nthe Carolines were discovered. They landed on a small island not\r\nfar from Yap. Here they succeeded in baptizing numerous natives and\r\nin establishing a mission. Fourteen of their number, headed by the\r\npriest, Padre Cantava, remained on the island while the expedition\r\nreturned to secure reenforcements and supplies. Unfortunately, this\r\nsuccor was delayed for more than a year, and when Spanish vessels\r\nwith missionary reenforcements on board again reached the Carolines\r\nin 1733, the mission had been entirely destroyed and the Spaniards,\r\nwith Padre Cantava, had been killed. These islands have been frequently\r\ncalled the \"New Philippines.\"\r\n\r\nConditions of the Filipinos during the Eighteenth Century.--During the\r\nmost of the eighteenth century, data are few upon the condition of the\r\nFilipino people. There seems to have been little progress. Conditions\r\ncertainly were against the social or intellectual advance of the\r\nnative race. Perhaps, however, their material well-being was quite\r\nas great during these years, when little was attempted, as during\r\nthe governorships of the more ambitious and enterprising Spaniards\r\nwho had characterized the earlier period of Philippine history.\r\n\r\nProvincial Governments.--Provincial administration seems to have\r\nfallen almost wholly into the hands of the missionaries. The priests\r\nmade themselves the local rulers throughout the Christianized portion\r\nof the archipelago.\r\n\r\nInsurrection in Bohol.--Insurrection seems especially to have\r\ntroubled the island of Bohol during most of the eighteenth century,\r\nand in 1750 an insurrection broke out which practically established\r\nthe independence of a large portion of the island, and which was not\r\nsuppressed for thirty-five years. The trouble arose in the town of\r\nInabanga, where the Jesuit priest Morales had greatly antagonized and\r\nimbittered the natives by his severity. Some apostasized, and went to\r\nthe hills. One of these men was killed by the orders of the priest and\r\nhis body refused Christian burial, and left uncared for and exposed.\r\n\r\nA brother of this man, named Dagohoy, infuriated by this indignity,\r\nheaded a sedition which shortly included three thousand natives. The\r\npriest was killed, and his own body left by the road unburied. In\r\nspite of the efforts of the alcalde of Cebu, Dagohoy was able to\r\nmaintain himself, and practically established a small native state,\r\nwhich remained until the occupation of the island by the Recollects,\r\nafter the Jesuits had been expelled from the Spanish dominions.\r\n\r\nActivity of the Jesuits.--During the eighteenth century the Jesuits\r\nalone of the religious orders seemed to have been active in prosecuting\r\ntheir efforts and seeking new fields for conversion. The sloth and\r\ninactivity which overcame the other orders place in greater contrast\r\nthe ambition and the activities, both secular and spiritual, of\r\nthe Jesuits.\r\n\r\nConversion of the Sultan Alim ud Din.--In 1747 they established\r\na mission even on Jolo. They were unable to overcome the intense\r\nantagonism of the Moro panditas and datos, but they apparently won the\r\nyoung sultan, Alim ud Din, whose strange story and shifting fortunes\r\nhave been variously told. One of the Jesuits, Padre Villelmi, was\r\nskilled in the Arabic language, and this familiarity with the language\r\nand literature of Mohammedanism doubtless explains his ascendency\r\nover the mind of the sultan. Alim ud Din was not a strong man. His\r\npower over the subordinate datos was small, and in 1748 his brother,\r\nBantilan, usurped his place and was proclaimed sultan of Jolo.\r\n\r\nAlim ud Din, with his family and numerous escort, came to Zamboanga,\r\nseeking the aid of the Spanish against his brother. From Zamboanga he\r\nwas sent to Manila. On his arrival, January 3, 1749, he was received\r\nwith all the pomp and honor due to a prince of high rank. A house for\r\nhis entertainment and his retinue of seventy persons was prepared in\r\nBinondo. A public entrance was arranged, which took place some fifteen\r\ndays after his reaching the city. Triumphal arches were erected\r\nacross the streets, which were lined with more than two thousand\r\nnative militia under arms. The sultan was publicly received in the\r\nhall of the Audiencia, where the governor promised to lay his case\r\nbefore the king of Spain. The sultan was showered with presents, which\r\nincluded chains of gold, fine garments, precious gems, and gold canes,\r\nwhile the government sustained the expense of his household. [79]\r\n\r\nFollowing this reception, steps were taken for his conversion. His\r\nspiritual advisers cited to him the example of the Emperor Constantine\r\nwhose conversion enabled him to effect triumphant conquests over\r\nhis enemies. Under these representations Alim ud Din expressed his\r\ndesire for baptism. The governor-general, who at this time was a\r\npriest, the bishop of Nueva Segovia, was very anxious that the rite\r\nshould take place; but this was opposed by his spiritual superior,\r\nthe archbishop of Manila, who, with some others, entertained doubts\r\nas to the sincerity of the sultan's profession.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish his baptism, the governor sent him to his own\r\ndiocese, where at Paniqui, on the 29th of April, 1750, the ceremony\r\ntook place with great solemnity. On the return of the party to Manila,\r\nthe sultan was received with great pomp, and in his honor were held\r\ngames, theatrical representations, fire-works, and bull-fights. This\r\nwas the high-water mark of the sultan's popularity.\r\n\r\nFailure to Reinstate Alim ud Din.--Meanwhile the usurper, Bantilan,\r\nwas giving abundant evidence of his hostility. The Spaniards were\r\ndriven from Jolo, and the fleets of the Moros again ravaged the\r\nBisayas. In July arrived the new governor, the Marquis of Obando,\r\nwho determined to restore Alim ud Din and suppress the Moro piracy.\r\n\r\nAn expedition set sail, with the sultan on board, and went as far as\r\nZamboanga, but accomplished nothing. Here the conduct of the sultan\r\nserved to confirm the doubts of the Spaniards as to the sincerity of\r\nhis friendship. He was arrested, and returned to Manila, and imprisoned\r\nin the fortress of Santiago. With varying treatment he remained in\r\nthe hands of the Spaniards until 1763, when he was returned to Jolo\r\nby the English.\r\n\r\nGreat Increase in Moro Piracy.--The year 1754 is stated to have been\r\nthe bloodiest in the history of Moro piracy. No part of the Bisayas\r\nescaped ravaging in this year, while the Camarines, Batangas, and Albay\r\nsuffered equally with the rest. The conduct of the pirates was more\r\nthan ordinarily cruel. Priests were slain, towns wholly destroyed,\r\nand thousands of captives were carried south into Moro slavery. The\r\ncondition of the Islands at the end of this year was probably the\r\nmost deplorable in their history.\r\n\r\nReforms under General Arandia.--The demoralization and misery with\r\nwhich Obando's rule closed were relieved somewhat by the capable\r\ngovernment of Arandia, who succeeded him. Arandia was one of the few\r\nmen of talent, energy, and integrity who stood at the head of affairs\r\nin these islands during two centuries.\r\n\r\nHe reformed the greatly disorganized military force, establishing\r\nwhat was known as the \"Regiment of the King,\" made up very largely\r\nof Mexican soldiers. He also formed a corps of artillerists composed\r\nof Filipinos. These were regular troops, who received from Arandia\r\nsufficient pay to enable them to live decently and like an army.\r\n\r\nHe reformed the arsenal at Cavite, and, in spite of opposition on\r\nall sides, did something to infuse efficiency and honesty into the\r\ngovernment. At the head of the armament which had been sent against\r\nthe Moros he placed a Jesuit priest, Father Ducos. A capable officer\r\nwas also sent to command the presidio at Zamboanga, and while Moro\r\npiracy was not stopped, heavy retaliation was visited upon the pirates.\r\n\r\nArandia's most popular act of government was the expulsion of the\r\nChinese from the provinces, and in large part from the city. They\r\nseem to have had in their hands then, perhaps even more than now, the\r\ncommerce or small trade between Manila and provincial towns. To take\r\nover this trade, Arandia founded a commercial company of Spaniards\r\nand mestizos, which lasted only for a year. The Christianized Chinese\r\nwere allowed to remain under license, and for those having shops in\r\nManila Arandia founded the Alcayceria of San Fernando. It consisted\r\nof a great square of shops built about an open interior. It stood\r\nin Binondo, on the present Calle de San Fernando, in what is still\r\na populous Chinese quarter.\r\n\r\nDeath of Arandia and Decline of the Colony.--Arandia died in May, 1759,\r\nand the government was assumed by the bishop of Cebu, who in turn was\r\nforced from his position by the arrival of the archbishop of Manila,\r\nDon Manuel Rojo. The archbishop revoked the celebrated orders of good\r\ngovernment which Arandia had put into force, and the colony promised\r\nto relapse once more into its customary dormant condition. This was,\r\nhowever, prevented by an event which brought to an end the long period\r\nof obscurity and inertia under which the colony had been gradually\r\ndecaying, and introduced, in a way, a new period of its history. This\r\nwas the capture of the Philippine Islands by the British in 1762.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINES DURING THE PERIOD OF EUROPEAN REVOLUTION. 1762-1837.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Philosophy of the Eighteenth Century.--The middle of the\r\neighteenth century in Europe was a time when ideas were greatly\r\nliberalized. A philosophy became current which professed to\r\nlook for its authority not to churches or hereditary custom and\r\nprivilege, but to the laws of God as they are revealed in the natural\r\nworld. Men taught that if we could only follow nature we could not do\r\nwrong. \"Natural law\" became the basis for a great amount of political\r\nand social discussion and the theoretical foundation of many social\r\nrights. The savage, ungoverned man was by many European philosophers\r\nand writers supposed to live a freer, more wholesome and more natural\r\nlife than the man who is bound by the conventions of society and the\r\nlaws of state.\r\n\r\nMost of this reasoning we now know to be scientifically untrue. The\r\nsavage and the hermit are not, in actual fact, types of human\r\nhappiness and freedom. Ideal life for man is found only in governed\r\nsociety, where there is order and protection, and where also should be\r\nfreedom of opportunity. But to the people of the eighteenth century,\r\nand especially to the scholars of France, where the government was\r\nmonarchical and oppressive, and where the people were terribly burdened\r\nby the aristocracy, this teaching was welcomed as a new gospel. Nor\r\nwas it devoid of grand and noble ideas--ideas which, carried out in\r\na conservative way, might have bettered society.\r\n\r\nIt is from this philosophy and the revolution which succeeded it that\r\nthe world received the modern ideas of liberty, equality, fraternity,\r\nand democracy. These ideas, having done their work in America and\r\nEurope, are here at work in the Philippines today. It remains to\r\nbe seen whether a society can be rebuilt here on these principles,\r\nand whether Asia too will be reformed under their influence.\r\n\r\nColonial Conflicts between the Great European Countries.--During\r\nthe latter half of the eighteenth century there culminated the long\r\nstruggle for colonial empire between European states which we have\r\nbeen following. We have seen how colonial conquest was commenced\r\nby the Portuguese, who were very shortly followed by the Spaniards,\r\nand how these two great Latin powers attempted to exclude the other\r\nEuropean peoples from the rich Far East and the great New World which\r\nthey had discovered.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how this attempt failed, how the Dutch and the English\r\nbroke in upon this gigantic reserve, drove the Spanish fleets from\r\nthe seas, and despoiled and took of this great empire almost whatever\r\nthey would. The Dutch and English then fought between themselves. The\r\nEnglish excluded the Dutch from North America, capturing their famous\r\ncolony of New Amsterdam, now New York, and incorporating it (1674)\r\nwith their other American colonies, which later became the United\r\nStates of America. But in the East Indies the Dutch maintained their\r\ntrade and power, gradually extending from island to island, until\r\nthey gained--what they still possess--an almost complete monopoly of\r\nspice production.\r\n\r\nWar between England and France.--In India, England in the eighteenth\r\ncentury won great possessions and laid the foundation for what has\r\nbeen an almost complete subjugation of this Eastern empire. Here,\r\nhowever, and even more so than in America, England encountered a\r\nroyal and brilliant antagonist in the monarch of France.\r\n\r\nFrench exploration in North America had given France claims to the\r\ntwo great river systems of the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi,\r\nthe latter by far the greatest and richest region of the temperate\r\nzone. So, during much of this eighteenth century, England and France\r\nwere involved in wars that had for their prizes the possession of\r\nthe continent of North America and the great peninsula of India.\r\n\r\nThis conflict reached its climax between 1756 and 1763. Both states\r\nput forth all their strength. France called to her support those\r\ncountries whose reigning families were allied to her by blood,\r\nand in this way Spain was drawn into the struggle. The monarchs of\r\nboth France and Spain belonged to the great house of Bourbon. War was\r\ndeclared between England and Spain in 1761. Spain was totally unfitted\r\nfor the combat. She could inflict no injury upon England and simply\r\nlay impotent and helpless to retaliate, while English fleets in the\r\nsame year took Havana in the west and Manila in the east.\r\n\r\nEnglish Victory over French in India and America.--English power in\r\nIndia was represented during these years by the greatest and most\r\nstriking figure in England's colonial history--Lord Clive. To him is\r\ndue the defeat of France in India, the capture of her possessions, and\r\nthe founding of the Indian Empire, which is still regarded as England's\r\ngreatest possession. The French were expelled from India in the same\r\nyear that the great citadel of New France in America--Quebec--was\r\ntaken by the English under General Wolfe.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines under the English.--Expedition from India to the\r\nPhilippines.--Lord Clive was now free to strike a blow at France's\r\nally, Spain; and in Madras an expedition was prepared to destroy\r\nSpanish power in the Philippines. Notice of the preparation of this\r\nexpedition reached Manila from several sources in the spring and summer\r\nof 1762; but with that fatality which pursued the Spaniard to the end\r\nof his history in the Philippines, no preparations were made by him,\r\nuntil on the 22d of September a squadron of thirteen vessels anchored\r\nin Manila Bay.\r\n\r\nThrough the mist, the stupid and negligent authorities of Manila\r\nmistook them for Chinese trading-junks; but it was the fleet of\r\nthe English Admiral Cornish, with a force of five thousand British\r\nand Indian soldiers under the command of General Draper. For her\r\ndefense Manila had only 550 men of the \"Regiment of the King\" and\r\neighty Filipino artillerists. Yet the Spaniards determined to make\r\nresistance from behind the walls of the city.\r\n\r\nSurrender of Manila to the English.--The English disembarked and\r\noccupied Malate. From the churches of Malate, Ermita, and Santiago\r\nthe British bombarded Manila, and the Spaniards replied from the\r\nbatteries of San Andres and San Diego, the firing not being very\r\neffective on either side.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th, Draper summoned the city to surrender; but a council of\r\nwar, held by the archbishop, who was also governor, decided to fight\r\non. Thirty-six hundred Filipino militia from Pampanga, Bulacan,\r\nand Laguna marched to the defense of the city, and on the 3rd of\r\nOctober two thousand of these Filipinos made a sally from the walls\r\nand recklessly assaulted the English lines, but were driven back with\r\nslaughter. On the night of the 4th of October a breach in the walls\r\nwas made by the artillery, and early in the morning of the 5th four\r\nhundred English soldiers entered almost without resistance. A company\r\nof militia on guard at the Puerto Real was bayoneted and the English\r\nthen occupied the Plaza, and here received the surrender of the fort\r\nof Santiago.\r\n\r\nThe English agreed not to interfere with religious liberty, and honors\r\nof war were granted to the Spanish soldiers. Guards were placed\r\nupon the convent of the nuns of Santa Clara and the beaterios, and\r\nthe city was given over to pillage, which lasted for forty hours,\r\nand in which many of the Chinese assisted.\r\n\r\nIndependent Spanish Capital under Anda at Bulacan.--The English were\r\nthus masters of the city, but during their period of occupation\r\nthey never extended their power far beyond the present limits of\r\nManila. Previous to the final assault and occupation of Manila, the\r\nauthorities had nominated the oidor, Don Simon de Anda y Salazar,\r\nlieutenant-governor and captain-general of the Islands, with\r\ninstructions to maintain the country in its obedience to the king of\r\nSpain. Anda left the capital on the night of October 4, passing in a\r\nlittle banca through the nipa swamps and esteros on the north shore\r\nof Manila Bay to the provincial capital of Bulacan.\r\n\r\nHere he called together the provincial of the Augustinian monks,\r\nthe alcalde mayor of the province, and some other Spaniards. They\r\nresolved to form an independent government representing Spain, and\r\nto continue the resistance. This they were able to do as long as\r\nthe British remained in the Islands. The English made a few short\r\nexpeditions into Bulacan and up the Pasig River, but there was no\r\nhard fighting and no real effort made to pursue Anda's force. The\r\nChinese welcomed the English and gave them some assistance, and for\r\nthis Anda slew and hung great numbers of them.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines Returned to Spain.--By the Treaty of Paris in 1763,\r\npeace was made, by which France surrendered practically all her\r\ncolonial possessions to England; but England returned to Spain her\r\ncaptures in Cuba and the Philippines. In March, 1764, there arrived\r\nthe Spanish frigate \"Santa Rosa,\" bringing the first \"Lieutenant of\r\nthe King for the Islands,\" Don Francisco de la Torre, who brought\r\nwith him news of the Treaty of Paris and the orders to the English\r\nto abandon the Islands.\r\n\r\nResistance of the English by the Friars.--In resistance to the English\r\nand in the efforts to maintain Spanish authority, a leading part had\r\nbeen taken by the friars. \"The sacred orders,\" says Martinez de Zuniga,\r\n[80] \"had much to do with the success of Senor Anda. They maintained\r\nthe Indians of their respective administrations loyal to the orders;\r\nthey inspired the natives with horror against the English as enemies of\r\nthe king and of religion, inciting them to die fighting to resist them;\r\nthey contributed their estates and their property; and they exposed\r\ntheir own persons to great dangers.\" The friars were certainly most\r\ninterested in retaining possession of the Islands and had most to\r\nlose by their falling into English hands.\r\n\r\nIncrease of the Jesuits in Wealth and Power.--In this zealous movement\r\nfor defense, however, the Jesuits bore no part; and there were charges\r\nmade against them of treasonable intercourse with the English, which\r\nmay have had foundation, and which are of significance in the light\r\nof what subsequently occurred.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the eighteenth century, all the governments of\r\nCatholic Europe were aroused with jealousy and suspicious hatred\r\nagainst the Jesuits. The society, organized primarily for missionary\r\nlabor, had gradually taken on much of a secular character. The society\r\nwas distinguished, as we have seen in its history in the Philippines,\r\nby men with great capacity and liking for what we may call practical\r\naffairs as distinguished from purely religious or devotional life. The\r\nJesuits were not alone missionaries and orthodox educators, but they\r\nwere scientists, geographers, financiers, and powerful and almost\r\nindependent administrators among heathen peoples. They had engaged\r\nso extensively and shrewdly in trade that their estates, warehouses,\r\nand exchanges bound together the fruitful fields of colonial provinces\r\nwith the busy marts and money-centers of Europe. Their wealth was\r\nbelieved to be enormous. Properly invested and carefully guarded,\r\nit was rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, made the order exasperating alike to rulers and\r\npeoples were the powerful political intrigues in which members of\r\nthe order engaged. Strong and masterful men themselves, the field of\r\nstate affairs was irresistibly attractive. Their enemies charged that\r\nthey were unscrupulous in the means which they employed to accomplish\r\npolitical ends. It is quite certain that the Jesuits were not patriotic\r\nin their purposes or plans. They were an international corporation;\r\ntheir members belonged to no one nation; to them the Society was\r\ngreater and more worthy of devotion than any state, in which they\r\nthemselves lived and worked.\r\n\r\nDissolution of the Society of Jesus.--Europe had, however, reached\r\nthe belief, to which it adheres today, that a man must be true to\r\nthe country in which he lives and finds shelter and protection and\r\nin which he ranks as a political member, or else incur odium and\r\npunishment. Thus it was their indifference to national feeling that\r\nbrought about the ruin of the Jesuits. It is significant that the\r\nrulers, the most devoted to Catholicism, followed one another in\r\ndecreeing their expulsion from their dominions. In 1759 they were\r\nexpelled from Portugal, in 1764 from France, and April 2, 1767,\r\nthe decree of confiscation and banishment from Spain and all Spanish\r\npossessions was issued by King Carlos III. Within a year thereafter,\r\nthe two most powerful princes of Italy, the king of Naples and the\r\nDuke of Parma, followed, and then the Grand Master of the Knights of\r\nMalta expelled them from that island. The friends of the order were\r\npowerless to withstand this united front of Catholic monarchs, and in\r\nJuly, 1773, Pope Clement XIV. suppressed and dissolved the society,\r\nwhich was not restored until 1814.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits Expelled from the Philippines.--The order expelling the\r\nJesuits from the Philippines was put into effect in the year 1767. The\r\ninstructions authorized the governor in case of resistance to use\r\nforce of arms as against a rebellion. [81] Besides their colleges in\r\nManila, Tondo, Cavite, Leyte, Samar, Bohol, and Negros, the Jesuits\r\nadministered curacies in the vicinity of Manila, in Cavite province,\r\nin Mindoro and Marinduque, while the islands of Bohol, Samar, and\r\nLeyte were completely under their spiritual jurisdiction. In Mindanao\r\ntheir missions, a dozen or more in number, were found on both the\r\nnorthern and southern coasts. Outside of the Philippines proper they\r\nwere the missionaries on the Ladrones, or Marianas. Their property in\r\nthe Philippines, which was confiscated by the government, amounted to\r\n1,320,000 pesos, although a great deal of their wealth was secreted\r\nand escaped seizure through the connivance of the governor, Raon.\r\n\r\nGovernor Anda's Charges against the Religious Orders.--Don Simon\r\nde Anda had been received in Spain with great honor for the defense\r\nwhich he had made in the Islands, and in 1770 returned as governor\r\nof the Philippines. His appointment was bitterly resented by the\r\nfriars. In 1768, Anda had addressed to the king a memorial upon the\r\ndisorders in the Philippines, in which he openly charged the friars\r\nwith commercialism, neglect of their spiritual duties, oppression\r\nof the natives, opposition to the teaching of the Spanish language,\r\nand scandalous interference with civil officials and affairs. Anda's\r\nremedy for these abuses was the rigorous enforcement of the laws\r\nactually existing for the punishment of such conduct and the return\r\nto Spain of friars who refused to respect the law.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, only partially successful in his policy. During the\r\nsix years of his rule, he labored unremittingly to restore the Spanish\r\ngovernment and to lift it from the decadence and corruption that had so\r\nlong characterized it. There were strong traits of the modern man in\r\nthis independent and incorruptible official. If he made many enemies,\r\nit is, perhaps, no less to the credit of his character; and if in the\r\nfew years of his official life he was unable to restore the colony,\r\nit must be remembered that he had few assistants upon whom to rely\r\nand was without adequate means.\r\n\r\nThe Moro Pirates.--The Moros were again upon their forays, and in\r\n1771 even attacked Aparri, on the extreme northern coast of Luzon,\r\nand captured a Spanish missionary. Anda reorganized the Armada de\r\nPintados, and toward the end of his life created also the Marina Sutil,\r\na fleet of light gunboats for the defense of the coasts against the\r\nattacks of pirates.\r\n\r\nFailure of an English Settlement.--The hostility of the Moro rulers\r\nwas complicated by the interference of the English, who, after the\r\nevacuation of Manila, continued to haunt the Sulu archipelago with\r\nthe apparent object of effecting a settlement. By treaty with the\r\nMoro datos, they secured the cession of the island of Balanbangan,\r\noff the north coast of Borneo. This island was fortified and a factory\r\nwas established, but in 1775 the Moros attacked the English with great\r\nfury and destroyed the entire garrison, except the governor and five\r\nothers, who escaped on board a vessel, leaving a great quantity of\r\narms and wealth to the spoils of the Moros. The English factors, who\r\nhad taken up business on the island of Jolo, fled in a Chinese junk;\r\nand these events, so unfortunate to the English, ended their attempts\r\nto gain a position in the Jolo archipelago until many years later.\r\n\r\nIncrease in Agriculture.--Anda died in October, 1776, and his\r\nsuccessor, Don Jose Basco de Vargas, was not appointed until July,\r\n1778. With Basco's governorship we see the beginning of those numerous\r\nprojects for the encouragement of agriculture and industry which\r\ncharacterized the last century of Spanish rule. His \"Plan general\r\neconomico\" contemplated the encouragement of cotton-planting, the\r\npropagation of mulberry-trees and silk-worms, and the cultivation of\r\nspices and sugar. Premiums were offered for success in the introduction\r\nof these new products and for the encouragement of manufacturing\r\nindustries suitable to the country and its people.\r\n\r\nOut of these plans grew the admirable Sociedad Economica de Amigos del\r\nPais, which was founded by Basco in 1780. The idea was an excellent\r\none, and the society, although suffering long periods of inactivity,\r\nlasted for fully a century, and from time to time was useful in the\r\nimprovement and development of the country, and stimulated agricultural\r\nexperiments through its premiums and awards.\r\n\r\nEstablishment of the Tobacco Industry.--Up to this time the Philippine\r\nrevenues had been so unproductive that the government was largely\r\nsupported by a subsidy of $250,000 a year paid by Mexico. Basco was\r\nthe first to put the revenues of the Islands upon a lucrative basis. To\r\nhim was due the establishment, in 1782, of the famous tobacco monopoly\r\n(estanco de tabacos) which became of great importance many years\r\nlater, as new and rich tobacco lands like the Cagayan were brought\r\nunder cultivation.\r\n\r\nFavorable Commercial Legislation.--The change in economic ideas,\r\nwhich had come over Europe through the liberalizing thought of the\r\neighteenth century, is shown also by a most radical step to direct into\r\nnew channels the commerce of the Philippines. This was the creation\r\nin 1785 of a great trading corporation with special privileges and\r\ncrown protection, \"The Royal Company of the Philippines.\"\r\n\r\nThe company was given a complete monopoly of all the commerce between\r\nSpain and the Philippines, except the long-established direct traffic\r\nbetween Manila and Acapulco. All the old laws, designed to prevent\r\nthe importation into the Peninsula of wares of the Orient, were swept\r\naway. Philippine products were exempted from all customs duty, either\r\non leaving Manila or entering Spain. The vessels of the company were\r\npermitted to visit the ports of China, and the ancient and absurd\r\nprohibition, which prevented the merchants of Manila from trading\r\nwith India, and China, was removed.\r\n\r\nThough still closing the Philippines against foreign trade, this\r\nstep was a veritable revolution in the commercial legislation of the\r\nPhilippines. Had the project been ably and heartily supported, it might\r\nhave produced a development that would have advanced prosperity half\r\na century; but the people of Manila did not welcome the opening of\r\nthis new line of communication. The ancient commerce with Acapulco\r\nwas a valuable monopoly to those who had the right to participate\r\nin it, and their attitude toward the new company was one either of\r\nindifference or hostility.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 the port of Manila was opened and made free to the vessels of\r\nall foreign nations for the space of three years, for the importation\r\nand sale exclusively of the wares of Asia; but the products of Europe,\r\nwith the exception of Spain, were forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Company was rechartered in 1805, and enjoyed its monopoly\r\nuntil 1830, when its privileges lapsed and Manila was finally opened\r\nto the ships of foreign nations.\r\n\r\nConquest of the Igorrote Provinces of Luzon.--Basco was a zealous\r\ngovernor and organized a number of military expeditions to occupy\r\nthe Igorrote country in the north. In 1785 the heathen Igorrotes of\r\nthe missions of Ituy and Paniqui in Nueva Vizcaya revolted and had\r\nto be reconquered by a force of musketeers from Cagayan.\r\n\r\nConquest of the Batanes Islands.--Basco also effected the conquest of\r\nthe Batanes Islands to the north of Luzon, establishing garrisons and\r\ndefinitely annexing them to the colony. The Dominican missionaries\r\nlong before this time had attempted to convert these islands to\r\nChristianity; but the poverty of the people and the fierceness of the\r\ntyphoons which sweep these little islands prevented the cultivation of\r\nanything more than camotes and taro, and had made them unprofitable\r\nto hold. Basco was honored, however, for his reoccupation of these\r\nislands, and on his return to Spain, at the expiration of his\r\ngovernorship, received the title of \"Count of the Conquest of the\r\nBatanes.\" [82]\r\n\r\nA Scientific Survey of the Coast of the Islands.--About 1790 the\r\nPhilippines were visited by two Spanish frigates, the \"Descubierta\" and\r\nthe \"Atrevida,\" under the command of Captain Malaspina. These vessels\r\nformed an exploring expedition sent out by the Spanish government to\r\nmake a hydrographic and astronomic survey of the coasts of Spanish\r\nAmerica, the Ladrones, and the Philippines. It was one of those\r\ncreditable enterprises for the widening of scientific knowledge which\r\nmodern governments have successively and with great honor conducted.\r\n\r\nThe expedition charted the Strait of San Bernardino, the coasts of\r\nseveral of the Bisayan Islands, and Mindanao. One of the scientists\r\nof the party was the young botanist, Don Antonio Pineda, who died\r\nin Ilocos in 1792, but whose studies in the flora of the Philippines\r\nthoroughly established his reputation. A monument to his memory was\r\nerected near the church in Malate, but it has since suffered from\r\nneglect and is now falling in ruins.\r\n\r\nEstablishment of a Permanent Navy in the Philippines.--The intentions\r\nof England in this archipelago were still regarded with suspicion by\r\nthe Spanish government, and in 1795 and 1796 a strong Spanish fleet,\r\nsent secretly by way of the coast of South America, was concentrated in\r\nthe waters of the Philippines under the command of Admiral Alava. Its\r\nobject was the defense of the Islands in case of a new war with\r\nGreat Britain. News of the declaration of war between these two\r\ncountries reached Manila in March, 1797, but though for many months\r\nthere was anxiety, England made no attempt at reoccupation. These\r\nevents led, however, to the formation of a permanent naval squadron,\r\nwith head-quarters and naval station at Cavite. [83]\r\n\r\nThe Climax of Moro Piracy.--The continued presence of the Moros in\r\nMindoro, where they haunted the bays and rivers of both east and west\r\ncoasts for months at a time, stealing out from this island for attack\r\nin every direction, was specially noted by Padre Zuniga, and indicated\r\nhow feebly the Spaniards repulsed these pirates a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIt was the last severe phase of Malay piracy, when even the strong\r\nmerchant ships of England and America dreaded the straits of Borneo and\r\npassed with caution through the China Sea. Northern Borneo, the Sulu\r\narchipelago, and the southern coasts of Mindanao were the centers from\r\nwhich came these fierce sea-wolves, whose cruel exploits have left\r\ntheir many traditions in the American and British merchant navies,\r\njust as they periodically appear in the chronicles of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nFive hundred captives annually seem to have been the spoils taken\r\nby these Moros in the Philippines Islands, and as far south as\r\nBatavia and Macassar captive Filipinos were sold in the slave marts\r\nof the Malays. The aged and infirm were inhumanly bartered to the\r\nsavage tribes of Borneo, who offered them up in their ceremonial\r\nsacrifices. The measures of the Spanish government, though constant\r\nand expensive, were ineffective. Between 1778 and 1793, a million and\r\na half of pesos were expended on the fleets and expeditions to drive\r\nback or punish the Moros, but at the end of the century a veritable\r\nclimax of piracy was attained.\r\n\r\nPirates swarmed continually about the coasts of Mindoro, Burias,\r\nand Masbate, and even frequented the esteros of Manila Bay. Some\r\nsort of peace seems to have been established with Jolo and a friendly\r\ncommerce was engaged in toward the end of the century, but the Moros\r\nof Mindanao and Borneo were increasing enemies. In 1798 a fleet of\r\ntwenty-five Moro bancas passed up the Pacific coast of Luzon and fell\r\nupon the isolated towns of Paler, Casiguran, and Palanan, destroying\r\nthe pueblos and taking 450 captives. The cura of Casiguran was ransomed\r\nin Binangonan for the sum of twenty-five hundred pesos. For four years\r\nthis pirate fleet had its rendezvous on Burias, whence it raided the\r\nadjacent coasts and the Catanduanes.\r\n\r\nThe Great Wars in America and Europe.--The English reoccupied\r\nBalanbangan in 1803, but held the island for only three years, when\r\nit was definitely abandoned. For some years, however, the coasts of\r\nthe Philippines were threatened by English vessels, and there was\r\nreflected here in the Far East the tremendous conflicts which were\r\nconvulsing Europe at this time. The wars which changed Europe at the\r\nclose of the eighteenth century, following the French Revolution,\r\nform one of the most important and interesting periods of European\r\nhistory, but it is also one of the most difficult periods to judge and\r\ndescribe. We will say of it here only so much as will be sufficient\r\nto show the effect upon Spain and so upon the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of the English Colonies in America.--In 1776 the\r\nthirteen English colonies on the Atlantic coast of North America\r\ndeclared their independence of Great Britain. In the unfair treatment\r\nof the British king and Parliament they had, they believed, just\r\ngrounds for revolution. For nearly eight years a war continued by which\r\nEngland strove to reduce them again to obedience. But at the end of\r\nthat time England, having successively lost two armies of invasion\r\nby defeat and capture, made peace with the American colonists and\r\nrecognized their independence. In 1789 the Americans framed their\r\npresent constitution and established the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution.--Condition of the People in France.--In their\r\nstruggle for independence the Americans had been aided by France,\r\nwho hoped through this opportunity to cripple her great colonial\r\nrival, England. Between America and France there was close sympathy\r\nof political ideas and theories, although in their actual social\r\nconditions the two countries were as widely separated as could\r\nbe. In America the society and government were democratic. All\r\nclasses were experienced in politics and government. They had behind\r\nthem the priceless heritage of England's long struggle for free and\r\nrepresentative government. There was an abundance of the necessaries\r\nof life and nearly complete freedom of opportunity.\r\n\r\nFrance, like nearly every other country of continental Europe, was\r\nsuffering from the obsolete burden of feudalism. The ownership of the\r\nland was divided between the aristocracy and the church. The great\r\nbulk of the population were serfs bound to the estates, miserably\r\noppressed, and suffering from lack of food, and despoiled of almost\r\nevery blessing which can brighten and dignify human life. The life\r\nof the court and of the nobility grew more luxurious, extravagant,\r\nand selfish as the economic conditions in France became worse. The\r\nking was nearly an absolute monarch. His will was law and the earlier\r\nrepresentative institutions, which in England had developed into the\r\nsplendid system of parliamentary government, had in France fallen\r\ninto decay.\r\n\r\nIn the other countries of Europe--the German States, Austria, Italy,\r\nand Spain--the condition of the people was quite as bad, probably in\r\nsome places even worse than it was in France. But it was in France\r\nthat the revolt broke forth, and it was France which led Europe in\r\na movement for a better and more democratic order. Frenchmen had\r\nfought in the armies of America; they had experienced the benefits of\r\na freer society, and it is significant that in the same year (1789)\r\nthat saw the founding of the American state the Revolution in France\r\nbegan. It started in a sincere and conservative attempt to remedy\r\nthe evils under which France was suffering, but the accumulation of\r\ninjustice and misery was too great to be settled by slow and hesitating\r\nmeasures. The masses, ignorant, and bitter with their wrongs, broke\r\nfrom the control of statesman and reformer, threw themselves upon the\r\nestablished state and church, both equally detestable to them, and tore\r\nthem to pieces. Both king and queen died by beheading. The nobility\r\nwere either murdered or expelled. The revolutionary government, if\r\nsuch it could be called, fell into the hands of wicked and terrible\r\nleaders, who maintained themselves by murder and terrorism.\r\n\r\nEffects of the Revolution.--These are the outward and terrible\r\nexpressions of the Revolution which were Seized upon by European\r\nstatesmen and which have been most dwelt upon by historical\r\nwriters. But, apart from the bloody acts of the years from 1793\r\nto 1795, the Revolution modernized France and brought incalculable\r\ngains to the French people. By the seizure of the great estates and\r\ntheir division among the peasantry, the agricultural products of the\r\ncountry were doubled in a single year, and that terrible condition\r\nof semi-starvation which had prevailed for centuries was ended.\r\n\r\nThe other monarchies of Europe regarded the events in France with\r\nhorror and alarm. Monarchs felt their own thrones threatened, and a\r\ncoalition of European monarchies was formed to destroy the republic\r\nand to restore the French monarchy and old regime. France found herself\r\ninvaded by armies upon every frontier. It was then that the remarkable\r\neffects produced by the Revolution upon the people of France appeared.\r\n\r\nWith a passionate enthusiasm which was irresistible, the people\r\nresponded to the call for war; great armies were enlisted, which by\r\nan almost uninterrupted series of victories threw back the forces of\r\nthe allies. Men rose from obscurity to the command of armies, and\r\nthere was developed that famous group of commanders, the marshals\r\nof France. Out of this terrible period of warfare there arose,\r\ntoo, another, who was perhaps, if we except the Macedonian king,\r\nAlexander, the greatest man ever permitted to lead armies and to rule\r\nmen--Bonaparte, later the emperor, Napoleon the First.\r\n\r\nThe New Republic under Napoleon the First.--From 1795, when Bonaparte\r\nwas given command of the invasion of Italy, until 1815, when he was\r\nfinally defeated at Waterloo in Belgium, Europe experienced almost\r\ncontinuous war. The genius of Napoleon reduced to the position of\r\nvassal states Italy, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, Germany, and\r\nAustria. In all these countries the ancient thrones were humbled,\r\nfeudalism was swept away, and the power of a corrupt church and\r\naristocracy was broken. In spite of the humiliation of national\r\npride, these great benefits to Europe of Napoleon's conquests can\r\nnot be overestimated. Wherever Napoleon's power extended there\r\nfollowed the results of the Revolution--a better system of law,\r\nthe introduction of the liberal \"Code Napoleon,\" the liberation of\r\nthe people from the crushing toils of mediaevalism, and the founding\r\nof a better society. These are the debts which Europe owes to the\r\nFrench Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Decline of Spain.--Lack of Progress.--In this advance and progress\r\nSpain did not share. The empire of Napoleon was never established\r\nin the Peninsula. In 1811 the Spaniards, with, the assistance of the\r\nEnglish under the great general, Wellington, repulsed the armies of\r\nthe French. This victory, so gratifying to national pride, was perhaps\r\na real loss to Spain, for the reforms which prevailed in other parts\r\nof Europe were never carried out in Spain, and she remains even yet\r\nunliberated from aristocratic and clerical power.\r\n\r\nA liberal constitutional government was, however, set up in Spain in\r\n1812 by the Cortes; but in 1814 King Ferdinand, aided by the Spanish\r\naristocracy and clergy, was able to overthrow this representative\r\ngovernment and with tyrannical power to cast reforms aside. Fifty\r\nthousand people were imprisoned for their liberal opinions,\r\nthe Inquisition was restored, the Cortes abolished, and its acts\r\nnullified. The effect of these acts upon the Philippines will be\r\nnoticed presently.\r\n\r\nSeparation of the Philippines from Mexico.--The events of these years\r\nserved to separate the Philippines from their long dependency on\r\nMexico. In 1813 the Cortes decreed the suppression of the subsidized\r\nAcapulco galleon. The Mexican trade had long been waning and voyages\r\nhad become less profitable. The last of the galleons left Manila in\r\n1811 and returned from Acapulco in 1815, never again to attempt this\r\nclassical voyage.\r\n\r\nThe cessation of these voyages only briefly preceded the complete\r\nseparation from America. From the first period of settlement,\r\nthe Philippines had in many respects been a sub-dependency of New\r\nSpain. Mexico had until late afforded the only means of communication\r\nwith the mother-country, the only land of foreign trade. Mexican\r\nofficials frequently administered the government of the Islands,\r\nand Mexican Indians formed the larger part of the small standing\r\narmy of the Philippines, including the \"Regiment of the King.\" As we\r\nhave seen, a large subsidy, the situado, was annually drawn from the\r\nMexican treasury to support the deficient revenues of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nRebellion of the South American Countries.--But the grievances of\r\nthe Spanish American colonists were very great and very real. The\r\nrevolution which had successively stirred North America and Europe\r\nnow passed back again to the Spanish countries of the New World,\r\nand between 1810 and 1825 they fought themselves free of Spain. The\r\nlast of the colonies from which the Spaniards were forced to retire\r\nwas Peru. Mexico achieved her separation in 1820. Spain lost every\r\npossession upon the mainland of both Americas, and the only vestiges\r\nof her once vast American empire were the rich islands of the Greater\r\nAntilles--Cuba and Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nLimited Trade with the Philippines.--The Philippines were now forced to\r\ncommunicate by ship directly with Spain. The route for the next fifty\r\nyears lay by sailing-vessels around the Cape of Good Hope. It occupied\r\nfrom four to six months, but this route had now become practically a\r\nneutral passage, its winds and currents were well understood, and it\r\nwas annually followed by great numbers of vessels of Europe, England,\r\nand the United States.\r\n\r\nTrade was still limited to the ships of the Royal Philippine Company,\r\nand this shipping monopoly lasted until 1835, when a new era in the\r\ncommercial and industrial life of the Philippines opened. An English\r\ncommercial house was established in Manila as early as 1809.\r\n\r\nVolcanic Eruptions.--The terrible eruptions of Mount Taal, the last\r\nof which occurred in 1754, were followed in the next century by the\r\ndestructive activity of Mount Mayon. In 1814 an indescribable eruption\r\nof ashes and lava occurred, and the rich hemp towns around the base\r\nof this mountain were destroyed. Father Francisco Aragoneses, cura of\r\nCagsaua, an eye-witness, states that twelve thousand people perished;\r\nin the church of Budiao alone two hundred lay dead. [84]\r\n\r\nRebellions in the Philippines.--The Liberal Spanish Cortes.--Two\r\nrevolts in the Philippines that occurred at this period are of much\r\nimportance and show the effect in the Philippines of the political\r\nchanges in Spain. In 1810 the liberal Spanish Cortes had declared that\r\n\"the kingdoms and provinces of America and Asia are, and ought to\r\nhave been always, reputed an integral part of the Spanish monarchy,\r\nand for that same, their natives and free inhabitants are equal in\r\nrights and privileges to those of the Peninsula.\"\r\n\r\nThis important declaration, which if carried out would have\r\ncompletely revolutionized Spain's colonial policy, was published in\r\nthe Philippines, and with that remarkable and interesting facility by\r\nwhich such news is spread, even among the least educated classes of\r\nFilipinos, this proclamation had been widely disseminated and discussed\r\nthroughout the Islands. It was welcomed by the Filipino with great\r\nsatisfaction, because he believed it exempted him from the enforced\r\nlabor of the polos and servicios. These were the unremunerated tasks\r\nrequired of Filipinos for the construction of public works, bridges,\r\nroads, churches, and convents.\r\n\r\nEffect of the Repeal of the Declaration of the Cortes.--King Ferdinand\r\nVII. in May, 1814, on his return to power, as we have seen, published\r\nthe famous decree abolishing constitutional government in Spain and\r\nannulling all the acts of the Cortes, including those which aimed\r\nto liberalize the government of the colonies. These decrees, when\r\npublished in the Philippines, appeared to the Filipinos to return\r\nthem to slavery, and in many places their disaffection turned to\r\nrebellion. In Ilocos twelve hundred men banded together, sacked\r\nconvents and churches, and destroyed the books and documents of\r\nthe municipal archives. Their fury seems to have been particularly\r\ndirected against the petty tyrants of their own race, the caciques\r\nor principales.\r\n\r\nThe result of Spanish civilization in the Philippines had been to\r\neducate, and, to a certain degree, enrich a small class of Filipinos,\r\nusually known as principales or the gente ilustrada. It is this class\r\nwhich has absorbed the direction of municipal and local affairs,\r\nand which almost alone of the Filipino population has shared in those\r\nbenefits and opportunities which civilized life should bring.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of the population have, unfortunately, fallen or\r\nremained in a dependent and almost semi-servile position beneath\r\nthe principales. In Ilocos this subordinate class, or dependientes,\r\nis known as kailian, and it was these kailian who now fell upon\r\ntheir more wealthy masters, burning their houses and destroying\r\ntheir property, and in some instances killing them. The assignment of\r\ncompulsory labor had been left to the principales in their positions\r\nas gobernadorcillos and cabezas de barangay, and these officials had\r\nunquestionably abused their power and had drawn down upon themselves\r\nthe vengeance of the kailian. [85]\r\n\r\nThis revolt, it will be noticed, was primarily directed neither\r\nagainst friars nor Spanish authorities, but against the unfortunate\r\nsocial order which the rule of Spain maintained.\r\n\r\nA Revolt Lead by Spaniards.--A plot, with far more serious motives,\r\ntook place in 1823. The official positions in the regiments and\r\nprovinces had previously been held almost entirely by Spaniards born\r\nin America or the Philippines. The government now attempted to fill\r\nthese positions with Spaniards from Manila. The officials, deprived of\r\ntheir positions, incited the native troops which they had commanded,\r\ninto a revolt, which began in the walled city in Manila. About eight\r\nhundred soldiers followed them, and they gained possession of the\r\nCuartel of the King, of the Royal Palace, and of the Cabildo, but\r\nthey failed to seize the fortress of Santiago. It was not properly a\r\nrevolt of Filipinos, as the people were not involved and did not rise,\r\nbut it had its influence in inciting later insurrection.\r\n\r\nInsurrection on Bohol.--Since the insurrection on Bohol in 1744, when\r\nthe natives had killed the Jesuit missionaries, a large part of the\r\nisland had been practically independent under the leader Dagohoy. After\r\nthe expulsion of the Jesuits, Recollects were placed in special\r\ncharge of those towns along the seacoast, which had remained loyal to\r\nSpain. An effort was made to secure the submission of the rebels by\r\nthe proclamation of a pardon, but the power of the revolt grew rather\r\nthan declined, until in 1827 it was determined to reduce the rebellion\r\nby force. An expedition of thirty-two hundred men was formed in Cebu,\r\nand in April, 1828, the campaign took place, which resulted in the\r\ndefeat of the rebels and their settlement in the Christian towns.\r\n\r\nThe New Provinces of Benguet and Abra.--It is proper to notice\r\nalso the slow advances of Spanish authority, which began to be made\r\nabout this time among the heathen tribes of northern Luzon. These\r\nfierce and powerful tribes occupy the entire range of the Cordillera\r\nCentral. Missionary effort in the latter half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury had succeeded in partly Christianizing the tribes along the\r\nriver Magat in Neuva Vizcaya, but the fierce, head-hunting hillmen\r\nremained unsubdued and unchristianized.\r\n\r\nBetween 1823 and 1829 the mission of Pidigan, under an Augustinian\r\nfriar, Christianized some thousands of the Tinguianes of the river\r\nAbra. In 1829 an expedition of about sixty soldiers, under Don\r\nGuillermo Galvey, penetrated into the cool, elevated plateau of\r\nBenguet. The diary of the leader recounts the difficult march up the\r\nriver Cagaling from Aringay and their delight upon emerging from the\r\njungle and cogon upon the grassy, pine-timbered slopes of the plateau.\r\n\r\nThey saw little cultivated valleys and small clusters of houses and\r\nsplendid herds of cattle, carabaos, and horses, which to this day have\r\ncontinued to enrich the people of these mountains. At times they were\r\nsurrounded by the yelling bands of Igorrotes, and several times they\r\nhad to repulse attacks, but they nevertheless succeeded in reaching the\r\nbeautiful circular depression now known as the valley of La Trinidad.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards saw with enthusiasm the carefully separated and walled\r\nfields, growing camotes, taro, and sugarcane. The village of about\r\nfive hundred houses was partly burned by the Spaniards, as the\r\nIgorrotes continued hostile. The expedition returned to the coast,\r\nhaving suffered only a few wounds. The commandancia of Benguet was\r\nnot created until 1846, in which year also Abra was organized as\r\na province.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS AND REVOLUTION. 1837-1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress during the Last Half-Century of Spanish Rule.--We have\r\nnow come to the last half-century and to the last phase of Spanish\r\nrule. In many respects this period was one of economic and social\r\nprogress, and contained more of promise than any other in the history\r\nof the Islands. During this last half-century the Spanish rulers\r\nhad numerous plans for the development and better administration of\r\nthe Philippines, and, in spite of a somewhat wavering policy and the\r\ncontinual sore of official peculation, this was a period of wonderful\r\nadvancement. Revolution and separation from Spain came at last, as\r\nrevolutions usually do, not because there was no effort nor movement\r\nfor reform, but because progress was so discouragingly slow and so\r\nirritatingly blocked by established interests that desired no change.\r\n\r\nEffect of Opening the Port of Manila to Foreign Trade.--Increase in\r\nAgriculture.--The opening of the port of Manila to foreign trade, in\r\n1837, was followed by a period of rising industry and prosperity. Up\r\nto this time the archipelago had not been a producing and exporting\r\ncountry, but the freeing of trade led to the raising of great harvests\r\nfor foreign export, which have made world-wide the fame of certain\r\nPhilippine productions. Chief among these are of course Manila hemp\r\nand tobacco. These were followed by sugar and coffee culture, the\r\nlatter plant enriching the province of Batangas, while the planting\r\nof new cocoanut groves yearly made of greater importance the yield\r\nof that excellent product, copra. These rich merchandises had entered\r\nvery little into commerce during the early decades of the century.\r\n\r\nIncrease in Exports.--In 1810 the entire imports of the Philippines\r\namounted in value to 5,329,000 dollars, but more than half of this\r\nconsisted of silver sent from Mexico. From Europe and the United\r\nStates trade amounted to only 175,000 dollars. The exports in the\r\nsame year amounted to 4,795,000 dollars, but a million and a half of\r\nthis was Mexican silver exported on to China, and the whole amount\r\nof exports to Europe and the United States was only 250,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 the exportation of hemp amounted to only 346 tons. But the\r\neffect upon production of opening Manila to foreign trade is seen\r\nin the export six years later of 2,585 tons. By 1858 the exportation\r\nof hemp had risen to 412,000 piculs, or 27,500 tons. Of this amount,\r\nnearly two thirds, or 298,000 piculs, went to the United States. At\r\nthis time the North Atlantic seaboard of America was the center of\r\na most active ship-building and ship-carrying trade. The American\r\nflag was conspicuous among the vessels that frequented these Eastern\r\nports, and \"Manila hemp\" was largely sought after by American seamen\r\nto supply the shipyards at home. Of sugar, the export in 1858 amounted\r\nto 557,000 piculs, of which more than half went to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAfter 1814 general permission had been given to foreigners to\r\nestablish trading-houses in Manila, and by 1858 there were fifteen such\r\nestablishments, of which seven were English and three American. [86]\r\n\r\nOther Ports Opened to Foreign Commerce.--In 1855 three other ports\r\nwere opened to foreign commerce--Sual in Pangasinan on the Gulf of\r\nLingayan, Iloilo, and Zamboanga. In 1863, Cebu likewise was made an\r\nopen port. The exports of Sual consisted only of rice, and in spite\r\nof its exceptional harbor this port never flourished, and is to-day\r\nno more than an unfrequented village.\r\n\r\nIloilo exported leaf tobacco, sugar, sapan or dyewood (an industry\r\nlong ago ruined), hemp, and hides. Zamboanga through the Chinese had a\r\nsmall trade with Jolo and the Moro Islands, and exported the produce of\r\nthese seas--sea-slug (tripang), shark fins, mother-of-pearl, tortoise\r\nshell, etc. For some years the customs laws in these ports were\r\ntrying and vexatious, and prevented full advantage being taken of the\r\nprivileges of export; but in 1869 this service was, by royal decree,\r\ngreatly liberalized and improved. Since that date the Philippines\r\nhave steadily continued to grow in importance in the commercial world.\r\n\r\nThe Form of Government under the Spanish.--General Improvements.--This\r\nis perhaps a convenient place to examine for the last time the\r\npolitical system which the Spaniards maintained in the country. In\r\n1850 there were thirty-four provinces and two politico-military\r\ncommandancias. In these provinces the Spanish administration was\r\nstill vested solely in the alcalde mayor, who until after 1886 was\r\nboth governor or executive officer and the judge or court for the\r\ntrial of provincial cases and crimes.\r\n\r\nMany of the old abuses which had characterized the government of\r\nthe alcaldes had been at least partially remedied. After 1844 they\r\nhad no longer the much-abused monopoly privilege of trade, nor had\r\nthey as free a hand in controlling the labor of the inhabitants; but\r\nopportunities for illegal enrichment existed in the administration\r\nof the treasury and tax system, and these opportunities were not\r\nslighted. Up to the very end of Spanish rule the officials, high and\r\nlow, are accused of stealing public money.\r\n\r\nThe Pueblo.--The unit of administration was the pueblo, or township,\r\nwhich ordinarily embraced many square miles of country and contained,\r\nnumerous villages, or \"barrios.\" The center of the town was naturally\r\nthe site where for centuries had stood the great church and the\r\nconvent of the missionary friars. These locations had always been\r\nadmirably chosen, and about them grew up the market and trading-shops\r\nof Chinese and the fine and durable homes of the more prosperous\r\nFilipinos and mestizos.\r\n\r\nAbout 1860 the government began to concern itself with the construction\r\nof public buildings and improvements, and the result is seen in many\r\npueblos in the finely laid-out plazas and well-built municipal edifices\r\ngrouped about the square--the \"tribunal,\" or town house, the jail,\r\nand the small but significant schoolhouses. The government of the\r\ntown was vested in a \"gobernadorcillo\" and a council, each of the\r\n\"consejales\" usually representing a hamlet or barrio.\r\n\r\nBut the Spanish friar, who in nearly every pueblo was the parish\r\ncurate, continued to be the paternal guardian and administrator of the\r\npueblo. In general, no matter was too minute for his dictation. Neither\r\ngobernadorcillo nor councillors dared act in opposition to his wishes,\r\nand the alcalde of the province was careful to keep on friendly terms\r\nand leave town affairs largely to his dictation. The friar was the\r\nlocal inspector of public instruction and ever vigilant to detect\r\nand destroy radical ideas. To the humble Filipino, the friar was the\r\nvisible and only representative of Spanish authority.\r\n\r\nThe Revolt of 1841.--Repression of the People by the\r\nFriars.--Unquestionably in the past, the work of the friars had been\r\nof very great value; but men as well as institutions may lose their\r\nusefulness, as conditions change, and the time was now approaching when\r\nthe autocratic and paternal regime of the friars no longer satisfied\r\nthe Filipinos. Their zeal was no longer disinterested, and their\r\nwork had become materialized by the possession of the vast estates\r\nupon which their spiritual charges lived and labored as tenants or\r\ndependents. The policy of the religious orders had, in fact, become\r\none of repression, and as the aspirations of the Filipinos increased,\r\nthe friars, filled with doubt and fear, tried to draw still tighter\r\nthe bonds of their own authority, and viewed with growing distrust\r\nthe rising ambition of the people.\r\n\r\nApolinario de la Cruz.--The unfortunate revolution of 1841 shows the\r\nwayward and misdirected enthusiasm of the Filipino; and the unwisdom\r\nof the friars. Apolinario de la Cruz, a young Filipino, a native\r\nof Lukban, Tayabas, came up to Manila filled with the ambition to\r\nlead a monastic life, and engaged in theological studies. By his\r\nattendance upon lectures and sermons and by imitation of the friar\r\npreachers of Manila, Apolinario became, himself, quite an orator,\r\nand, as subsequent events showed, was able to arouse great numbers\r\nof his own people by his appeals.\r\n\r\nIt was his ambition to enter one of the regular monastic orders,\r\nbut this religious privilege was never granted to Filipinos, and he\r\nwas refused. He then entered a brotherhood known as the Cofradia, or\r\nBrotherhood of San Juan de Dios, composed entirely of Filipinos. After\r\nsome years in this brotherhood, he returned in 1840 to Tayabas and\r\nfounded the Cofradia de San Jose, his aim being to form a special\r\ncult in honor of Saint Joseph and the Virgin. For this he requested\r\nauthorization from Manila. It was here that the lack of foresight of\r\nthe friars appeared.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition of the Friars.--Instead of sympathizing with these\r\nreligious aspirations, in which, up to this point, there seems to have\r\nbeen nothing heretical, they viewed the rise of a Filipino religious\r\nleader with alarm. Their policy never permitted to the Filipino any\r\nposition that was not wholly subordinate. They believed that the\r\npermanence of Spanish power in these islands lay in suppressing any\r\nlatent ability for leadership in the Filipino himself. Their influence,\r\nconsequently, was thrown against Apolinario, and the granting of the\r\nauthority for his work. They secured not only a condemnation of his\r\nplan, but an order for the arrest and imprisonment of all who should\r\nattend upon his preaching.\r\n\r\nApolinario Forced to Rebel.--Apolinario thereupon took refuge\r\nin independent action. His movement had already become a strong\r\none, and his followers numbered several thousand people of Laguna,\r\nTayabas, and Batangas. The governor of Tayabas province, Don Joaquin\r\nOrtega, organized an expedition to destroy the schism. Accompanied\r\nby two Franciscan friars, he attacked Apolinario in the month of\r\nOctober, 1840, and was defeated and killed. One account says that\r\nApolinario was assisted by a band of Negritos, whose bowmanship was\r\ndestructive. There are still a very few of these little blacks in\r\nthe woods in the vicinity of Lukban.\r\n\r\nApolinario was now in the position of an open rebel, and he fortified\r\nhimself in the vicinity of Alitao, where he built a fort and chapel.\r\n\r\nHis religious movement became distinctly independent and heretical. A\r\nchurch was formed, of which he was first elected archbishop and then\r\nsupreme pontiff. He was also charged with having assumed the title of\r\n\"King of the Tagalog.\"\r\n\r\nFinally a force under the new alcalde, Vital, and General Huet early in\r\nNovember attacked Apolinario's stronghold and after a fierce struggle\r\ndefeated the revolutionists. About a thousand Filipinos perished in\r\nthe final battle. Apolinario was captured and executed. He was then\r\ntwenty-seven years of age.\r\n\r\nOrganization of Municipal Governments.--In 1844 an able and liberal\r\ngovernor, General Claveria, arrived, and remained until the end of the\r\nyear 1849. A better organization of the provincial governments, which\r\nwe have seen, followed Claveria's entrance into office, and in October,\r\n1847, came the important decree, organizing the municipalities in\r\nthe form which we have already described, and which remained without\r\nsubstantial modification to the end of Spanish rule, and which has\r\nto a considerable extent been followed in the Municipal Code framed\r\nby the American government.\r\n\r\nSubjection of the Igorrote Tribes.--With Claveria began a decisive\r\npolicy of conquest among the Igorrote tribes of northern Luzon, and\r\nby the end of Spanish rule these mountains were dotted with cuartels\r\nand missions for the control of these unruly tribes. The province of\r\nNueva Vizcaya has been particularly subject to the raids of these\r\nhead-hunting peoples. Year after year the Christian towns of the\r\nplains had yielded a distressing sacrifice of life to satisfy the\r\nsavage ceremonials of the Igorrotes. [87]\r\n\r\nIn 1847, Claveria nominated as governor of Nueva Vizcaya, Don Mariano\r\nOzcariz, whose severe and telling conquests for the first time checked\r\nthese Igorrote outrages and made possible the development of the\r\ngreat valleys of northern Luzon.\r\n\r\nSpanish Settlements on Mindanao.--Zamboanga.--With Claveria's\r\ngovernorship we enter also upon the last phase of Moro piracy. In spite\r\nof innumerable expeditions, Spain's occupation of South Mindanao and\r\nthe Sulu archipelago was limited to the presidio of Zamboanga. She had\r\noccupied this strategic point continuously since the reestablishment\r\nof Spanish power in 1763, The great stone fort, which still stands,\r\nhad proved impregnable to Moro attack, and had long been unmolested.\r\n\r\nDistributed for a distance of some miles over the rich lands at this\r\nend of the Zamboanga peninsula was a Christian population, which\r\nhad grown up largely from the descendants of rescued captives of the\r\nMoros. Coming originally from all parts of the Bisayas, Calamianes, and\r\nLuzon, this mixed population has grown to have a somewhat different\r\ncharacter from that of any other part of the Islands. A corrupt\r\nSpanish dialect, known as the \"Chabucano,\" has become the common\r\nspeech, the only instance in the Philippines where the native dialect\r\nhas been supplanted. This population, loyal and devotedly Catholic,\r\nnever failed to sustain the defense of this isolated Spanish outpost,\r\nand contributed brave volunteers to every expedition against the\r\nMoro islands.\r\n\r\nActivity of Other Nations.--But Spain's maintenance of Zamboanga was\r\ninsufficient to sustain her claims of sovereignty over the Sulu and\r\nTawi-Tawi groups. Both the Dutch and English planned various moves for\r\ntheir occupation and acquisition, and in 1844 a French fleet entered\r\nthe archipelago and concluded a treaty with the sultan of Sulu for\r\nthe cession of the island of Basilan for the sum of one million\r\ndollars. Writings of the French minister and historian, M. Guizot,\r\nshow that France hoped, by the acquisition of this island, to obtain\r\na needed naval base in the East and found a great commercial port\r\nwithin the sphere of Chinese trade. [88]\r\n\r\nConquest of the Gulf of Davao.--But this step roused the Spaniards\r\nto activity and the occupation of the island. A naval vessel subdued\r\nthe towns along the north coast, and then proceeding to the mouth of\r\nthe Rio Grande, secured from the sultan of Maguindanao the cession\r\nof the great Gulf of Davao. Spain took no immediate steps to occupy\r\nthis gulf, but in 1847 a Spaniard, Don Jose Oyanguran, proposed to\r\nthe governor, Claveria, to conquer the region at his own expense,\r\nif he could be furnished with artillery and munitions and granted a\r\nten years' government of Davao, with the exclusive privilege of trade.\r\n\r\nHis offer was accepted by the governor and the Audiencia, and Oyanguran\r\norganized a company to secure funds for the undertaking. In two\r\nyears' time he had subdued the coast regions of this gulf, expelled\r\nthe pirates who harbored there, and founded the settlement of Nueva\r\nVergara. He seems to have been making progress toward the conquest\r\nand commercial exploitation of this region, when jealous attacks in\r\nManila induced Governor Urbistondo to cancel his privilege and to\r\nrelieve him by an officer of the government.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent years the Jesuits had a few mission stations here and\r\nmade a few converts among the Bagobos; but the region is still an\r\nunsubdued and unutilized country, whose inhabitants are mainly pagan\r\ntribes, and whose rich agricultural possibilities lie undeveloped\r\nand unclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe Samal Pirates.--The Sulu.--The piratical inhabitants of the\r\nSulu archipelago are made of two distinct Malayan peoples--the Sulu\r\n(or Sulug), and the Samal, who are known throughout Malaysia as the\r\n\"Bajau\" or \"Orang laut\" (Men of the Sea). The former appear to be\r\nthe older inhabitants. They occupy the rich and populous island of\r\nJolo and some islands of the Siassi group, immediately south.\r\n\r\nThe Samal.--The Samal, or Bajau, are stated to have come originally\r\nfrom Johore. Many of them live almost exclusively in their boats,\r\npassing their lives from birth to death upon the sea. They are found\r\nthroughout most parts of Malaysia, the position of their little fleets\r\nchanging with the shifting of the monsoons. In the Sulu archipelago\r\nand a few points in South Mindanao, many of these Samal have shifted\r\ntheir homes from their boats to the shore. Their villages are built\r\non piles over the sea, and on many of the low coral reefs south of\r\nSiassi and east of Tawi-Tawi there are great towns or settlements\r\nwhich have apparently been in existence a long while.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the Samal were very numerous in the many islands\r\nbetween Jolo and Basilan, and this group is still known as the Islas\r\nSamales. Like the Sulu and other Malays, the Samal are Mohammedans,\r\nand scarcely less persistent pirates than their fellow-Malays. With the\r\ndecline of piratical power among the Sulu of Jolo, the focus of piracy\r\nshifted to these settlements of the Samal, and in the time of Claveria\r\nthe worst centers were the islands of Balanguingui and Tonquil, lying\r\njust north of the island of Jolo. From here pirate and slaving raids\r\nupon the Bisayan Islands continued to be made, and nearly every year\r\ntowns were sacked and burned and several hundred unfortunate captives\r\ncarried away. The captives were destined for slavery, and regular marts\r\nexisted for this traffic at Jolo and on the Bay of Sandakan in Borneo.\r\n\r\nArrival of Steam Warships.--In 1848 the Philippines secured the\r\nfirst steam war vessels. These were the \"Magellanes,\" the \"Elcano,\"\r\nand the \"Reina de Castilla.\" They were destined to revolutionize\r\nMoro relations.\r\n\r\nThe Destruction of the Samal Forts.--Hitherto it had been possible\r\nfor the great Moro war praos, manned by many oarsmen, to drop their\r\nmasts on the approach of an armed sailing-vessel, and, turning\r\ntoward the \"eye of the wind,\" where no sailing-ship could pursue,\r\nrow calmly away from danger. Steam alone was effective in combating\r\nthese sea-wolves. Claveria took these newly arrived ships, and with\r\na strong force of infantry, which was increased by Zamboangueno\r\nvolunteers, he entered the Samal group in February, 1848, and landed\r\non the island of Balanguingui.\r\n\r\nThere were four fortresses situated in the mangrove marshes of the\r\nisland. These, in spite of a desperate resistance, were carried by\r\nthe infantry and Zamboanguenos and the pirates scattered. The conduct\r\nof the campaign appears to have been admirable and the fighting\r\nheroic. The Moros were completely overwhelmed; 450 dead were burned\r\nor interred; 124 pieces of artillery--for the most part, the small\r\nbrass cannon called \"lantacas\"--were captured, and 150 Moro boats were\r\ndestroyed. The Spaniards cut down the cocoanut groves, and with spoil\r\nthat included such rich pirate loot as silks, silver vases, ornaments,\r\nand weapons of war, and with over two hundred prisoners and three\r\nhundred rescued captives, returned to Zamboanga. This was the most\r\nsignal victory ever won by Europeans in conflict with Malay piracy. The\r\neffectiveness of this campaign is shown by the fact that while in\r\nthe preceding year 450 Filipinos had suffered capture at the hands\r\nof Moro pirates, in 1848 and the succeeding year there was scarcely\r\na depredation. But in 1850 a pirate squadron from Tonquil, an island\r\nadjacent to Balanguingui, fell upon Samar and Camaguin. Fortunately,\r\nGovernor Urbistondo, who had succeeded Claveria, vigorously continued\r\nthe policy of his predecessor, and an expedition was promptly\r\ndispatched which destroyed the settlements and strongholds on Tonquil.\r\n\r\nDestruction of the Moro Forts at Jolo.--A year later war broke out\r\nagain with Jolo, and after a varied interchange of negotiations and\r\nhostilities, the Spaniards stormed and took the town in February,\r\n1851. The question of permanent occupation of this important site was\r\ndebated by a council of war, but their forces appearing unequal to\r\nthe task, the forts of the Moros were destroyed, and the expedition\r\nreturned. Jolo is described at this time as a very strongly guarded\r\nsituation. Five forts and a double line of trenches faced the\r\nshore. The Moro town is said to have contained about seven thousand\r\nsouls, and there was a barrio of Chinese traders, who numbered about\r\nfive hundred.\r\n\r\nTreaty with the Sultan of Jolo.--A few months later the governor of\r\nZamboanga concluded a treaty with the sultan of Jolo by which the\r\narchipelago was to be considered an incorporated part of the Spanish\r\npossessions. The sultan bound himself to make no further treaties\r\nwith or cessions to foreign powers, to suppress piracy, and to fly the\r\nSpanish flag. The Moros were guaranteed the practice of their religion,\r\nthe succession of the sultan and his descendants in the established\r\norder, boats of Jolo were to enjoy the same trading privileges in\r\nSpanish ports as other Filipino vessels, and the sultan retained\r\nthe right to all customs duties on foreign trading-vessels. Finally,\r\n\"in compensation for the damages of war,\" the sultan was to be paid\r\nan annual subsidy of 1,500 pesos and 600 pesos each to three datos\r\nand 360 pesos to a sherif. [89]\r\n\r\nThe End of Malay Piracy.--In these very years that Malay piracy was\r\nreceiving such severe blows from the recuperating power and activity\r\nof the Spanish government on the north, it was crushed also from\r\nthe south by the merciless warfare of a great Englishman, the Raja\r\nCharles Brooke of Sarawak. The sources of pirate depredation were\r\nMaguindanao, the Sulu archipelago, and the north and west coasts of\r\nthe great island of Borneo. We have seen how these fleets, century\r\nafter century, swept northward and wasted with fire and murder the\r\nfair islands of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nBut this archipelago was not alone in suffering these ravages. The\r\npeaceful trading inhabitants of the great island groups to the south\r\nwere persistently visited and despoiled. Moreover, as the Chinese\r\ntrade by the Cape of Good Hope route became established in the first\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century, these pirates became a great menace\r\nto European shipping. They swarmed the China Sea, and luckless indeed\r\nwas the ship carried too far eastward on its course. Every American\r\nschoolboy is familiar with the stories of fierce hand-to-hand struggles\r\nwith Malay pirates, which have come down from those years when the\r\nAmerican flag was seen everywhere in the ports of the Far East.\r\n\r\nAbout 1839 a young English officer, [90] who had been in the Indian\r\nservice, Charles Brooke, having armed and equipped a yacht of about\r\n140 tons, set sail for the coast of Borneo, with the avowed intent of\r\ndestroying Malay piracy and founding an independent state. In all the\r\nromantic stories of the East there is no career of greater daring than\r\nthat of this man. In 1841, having engaged in several bloody exploits,\r\nBrooke forced from the sultan of Borneo the cession of Sarawak,\r\nwith the government vested in himself as an independent raja.\r\n\r\nBrooke now devoted himself with merciless severity to the destruction\r\nof the pirates in the deep bays and swampy rivers, whence they had\r\nso long made their excursions. Later he was assisted by the presence\r\nof the English man-of-war \"Dido,\" and in 1847 the sultan of Brunei\r\nceded to Great Britain the island of Labuan. In 1849, Brooke visited\r\nZamboanga in the English man-of-war \"Moeander,\" and concluded a treaty\r\nwith the sultan of Sulu, which greatly alarmed the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nBrooke's private correspondence shows that he was ambitious and hopeful\r\nof acquiring for England parts of the Dutch possessions in the south\r\nand the Spanish Philippines in the north; but his plans were never\r\nfollowed up by England, although in 1887 North Borneo was ceded to\r\nan English company, and all the northern and eastern portions of this\r\ngreat island are now under English protection. [91]\r\n\r\nLiberal Ideas among the Filipinos.--The release from Moro\r\npiracy, the opening of foreign commerce, and the development of\r\nagricultural production were rapidly bringing about a great change\r\nin the aspirations of the Filipino people themselves. Nearly up to\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century the Filipinos had felt the\r\nfull effect of isolation from the life and thought of the modern\r\nworld. But the revolutionary changes in Europe and the struggles\r\nfor constitutional government in Spain had their influence, even\r\nin these far-away Spanish possessions. Spaniards of liberal ideas,\r\nsome of them in official positions, found their way to the Islands,\r\nand an agitation began, originating among Spaniards themselves,\r\nagainst the paternal powers of the friars.\r\n\r\nInfluence of the Press.--The growth of periodic literature accelerated\r\nthis liberalizing movement. The press, though suffering a severe\r\ncensorship, has played a large part in shaping recent thought in\r\nthese islands and in communicating to the Filipino people those\r\nideas and purposes which ever inspire and elevate men. [92] The first\r\nnewspaper to make its appearance in the Philippines was in 1822--\"El\r\nPhilantropo\"; but journalism assumed no real importance until the\r\nforties, when there were founded \"Semanario Filipino\" (1843), and\r\nalmost immediately after several others--\"El Amigo de Pais\" (1845),\r\n\"La Estrella\" (1846), and \"La Esperanza\" (1847), the first daily. These\r\nwere followed by \"Diario de Manila\" (1848); in 1858 \"El Comercio\"\r\nappeared, the oldest of the papers still in existence. [93]\r\n\r\nPapers conducted by Filipinos and in the Filipino tongues are of more\r\nrecent origin, but these early Spanish periodicals had a real effect\r\nupon the Filipinos themselves, training up a class familiar with the\r\nconduct of journalism and preparing a way for the very influential\r\nwork of the Filipino press in recent years.\r\n\r\nEstablishment of an Educational System.--Return of the Jesuits.--But\r\nmore important than all other influences was the opening of education\r\nto Filipinos. In 1852 a royal decree authorized the Jesuits to return\r\nto the Philippines. The conditions under which they came back were\r\nthat they should devote themselves solely to missions in the unoccupied\r\nfields of Mindanao, and to the higher education of the Filipinos.\r\n\r\nThe Public Schools.--In 1860, O'Donnell, the Spanish minister of\r\nwar and colonies (Ultramar), founded the system of public primary\r\ninstruction. A primary school for boys and one for girls was to\r\nbe established in each pueblo of the Islands. In these schools,\r\ninstruction was to be given in the Spanish language. A superior\r\ncommission of education was formed, which consisted of the governor,\r\nthe archbishop, and seven other members added by the governor himself.\r\n\r\nThe system was not secular, for it primarily was devoted to the\r\nteaching of religious doctrine. The Spanish friar, the pueblo curate,\r\nwas the local inspector of schools and practically directed their\r\nconduct. It was not wholly a free system, because tuition was required\r\nof all but the poorest children; nor was it an adequate system,\r\nbecause, even when most complete, it reached only a small proportion\r\nof the children of a parish, and these very largely were of the\r\nwell-to-do families. And yet this system, for what it accomplished,\r\nis deserving of great credit.\r\n\r\nBesides the church, the convent, and the tribunal, nearly every town\r\nin the Philippines, toward the close of Spanish rule, had also, in the\r\npublic plaza, its public school buildings for boys and for girls. In\r\nthese towns a number of Filipinos were taught to converse in the\r\nSpanish language and at least the rudiments of Spanish education. But\r\nthis system did not give opportunity for education to the little\r\nchild of the humble fisherman and the husbandman.\r\n\r\nThe Manila Normal School.--To prepare Filipino teachers to do this\r\nwork of primary instruction, a decree of 1863 established the Manila\r\nNormal School. In charge of the Jesuits, this school was inaugurated\r\nin January, 1865. And about the same date the government decreed the\r\nfoundation of the Jesuit \"Ateneo Municipal\" for higher instruction\r\nin the classics and sciences that should conduct the student to the\r\ndegree of bachelor of arts. The influence of these institutions upon\r\nthe development of the Filipino has been remarkable. In one or the\r\nother of them have been trained nearly all of those young men who in\r\nrecent years have stirred the Filipino people to wide ambitions and\r\ndemands. At the same time the excellent Jesuit observatory, which has\r\ndone such important work in meteorology, was established in charge\r\nof Padre Faura.\r\n\r\nIncrease in Spanish Population.--The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869\r\nbrought immense changes to the Islands. Previous to this date Spanish\r\nresidents had been few. Almost the only class deeply interested in the\r\nIslands and permanently established here had been the friars. But with\r\ncommunication by steamer in thirty days from Barcelona to Manila,\r\na new interest was felt by Spaniards in the Philippines, though\r\nunfortunately this interest was greatest among the politicians. Some\r\nof the projects planned and decreed can only be regarded as visionary\r\nand beyond the point of serviceability, and others, more unfortunately\r\nstill, had for their purpose the creation of offices and emoluments\r\nfor Peninsula politicians; but they all contributed to bring to an\r\nend the paternal government under which there was no prospect of\r\nfurther enlightenment or progress for the Filipino.\r\n\r\nIncrease in the Number of Wealthy, Educated Filipinos.--The\r\nFilipino had now become embarked upon a new current of intellectual\r\nexperience--a course of enlightenment which has been so full of\r\nunexpected development, and which has already carried him so far from\r\nhis ancestor of one hundred years ago, that we can not say what advance\r\nanother generation or two may bring. Throughout all the towns of the\r\nIslands a class was rapidly growing up to which the new industries\r\nhad brought wealth. Their means enabled them to build spacious and\r\nsplendid homes of the fine, hard woods of the Philippines, and to\r\nsurround themselves with such luxuries as the life of the Islands\r\npermitted. This class was rapidly gaining education. It acquired a\r\nknowledge of the Spanish language, and easily assumed that graceful\r\ncourtesy which distinguishes the Spaniard.\r\n\r\nThe only misfortune, as regards this class, was that it was very\r\nsmall. It could embrace but a few families in each populous town. Some\r\nof these had Chinese and Spanish blood in their veins, but other\r\nnotable families were pure Filipinos.\r\n\r\nAttitude of the Spanish and the Friars toward Filipino Education.--The\r\ngreat mistake committed by the Spaniard was that he rarely welcomed\r\nthe further progress of the native population, and the center of\r\nthis opposition to the general enlightenment of the race was the\r\nfriars. Thus those who had been the early protectors and educators,\r\nlittle by little, because of their extreme conservatism and their\r\nfear of loosening the ties that bound the Filipino to the church and\r\nto Spain, changed into opponents of his progress and enemies of his\r\nenlightenment; but the education which the church itself had given to\r\nthe Filipino, and which had been fostered by the state and especially\r\nin recent times by the Jesuits, had made the Filipino passionately\r\nambitious for more enlightenment and freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Rule of Governor Torre.--Liberal Reforms.--In 1868, Queen\r\nIsabella II. of Spain was deposed, and a little later a revolutionary\r\ngovernment, the \"Republic of Spain,\" was founded. It was the brief\r\ntriumph of that reforming and liberal spirit which for so many years\r\nhad been struggling to free Spain from the burdens of aristocracy\r\nand ecclesiasticism.\r\n\r\nThe natural consequence was the sending of a liberal governor\r\nto the Philippines and the publication of liberal principles and\r\nreforms. This governor was General de la Torre. He was a brave and\r\nexperienced soldier and a thorough democrat at heart. He dispensed\r\nwith the formality and petty pomp with which the governors of Manila\r\nhad surrounded themselves; he dismissed the escort of halberdiers,\r\nwith their mediaeval uniforms and weapons, which had surrounded the\r\ngovernor-generals since 1581, and rode out in civilian's clothes and\r\nwithout ostentation. His efforts were directed to encouraging the\r\nFilipinos and to attaching them to Spain. In the eyes of the Spanish\r\nlaw, for a brief period, Spaniard and colonists had become equal,\r\nand La Torre tried to enforce this principle and make no distinction\r\nof race or birth. While Filipinos were encouraged and delighted,\r\nit is impossible to describe the disgust of the Spanish population\r\nand the opposition of the friars. La Torre was attacked and opposed,\r\nand the entire course of his governorship was filled with trouble,\r\nin which, naturally, liberal ideas gained wider and wider currency\r\namong the Filipinos.\r\n\r\nEffect of the Opposition of the Friars.--The friars, being the most\r\ninfluential opponents of the Filipino, naturally came to be regarded\r\nby the Filipinos as their greatest enemies, and the anti-friar spirit\r\ndaily spread and intensified. A party was formed which demanded that\r\nthe friars vacate the parishes, and that their places be filled by\r\nsecular priests, in accordance with the statutes of the Council of\r\nTrent. This party was headed by a native priest, Dr. Jose Burgos.\r\n\r\nA Filipino Movement for Reform.--After the fall of the republic in\r\nSpain and the restoration of the monarchy, the administration in the\r\nPhilippines attempted to extirpate the rising tide of liberal thought;\r\nbut these ideas had taken root and could not be suppressed. The\r\nFilipino party, if so we may call it, continued to plan and work\r\nfor reform. It numbered not only those of Filipino blood, but many\r\nof Spanish descent, born in the Philippines. There is no certain\r\nevidence that they were at this time plotting for independence, or\r\nthat their actions were treasonable; but the fear and hatred felt\r\nby the Spaniards resulted frequently in the exile and punishment of\r\nknown advocates of reform.\r\n\r\nThe Cavite Revolt.--In 1872 there occurred an important outbreak\r\nknown as the Cavite Revolt. Two hundred native soldiers at the\r\nCavite arsenal rose, killed their officers, and shouted \"Death to\r\nSpain!\" They had fellow-conspirators among the troops in Manila,\r\nbut owing to mistakes in their plans these failed to rise with them\r\nand the revolt was easily suppressed.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately followed by the arrest of a large number of\r\nFilipinos who had been conspicuous in La Torre's time and who were\r\nadvocates of reform. This number included the three priests, Fathers\r\nBurgos, Zamora, and Gomez, besides Don Antonio Regidor, Don Joaquin\r\nPardo de Tavera, Don Pedro Carillo, and others. A council of war\r\ncondemned to death forty-one of the participants in the Cavite riot,\r\nand these were shot on the morning of the 27th of January, 1872,\r\non the Field of Bagumbayan. On the 6th of February a council of war\r\ncondemned to death eleven more soldiers of the regiment of artillery,\r\nbut this sentence was commuted by the governor to life imprisonment. On\r\nthe 15th of February the same council of war sentenced to death upon\r\nthe garrote, the priests Burgos, Zamora, Gomez, and a countryman,\r\nSaldua; and this sentence was executed on the morning of the 17th.\r\n\r\nThe Spread of Secret Organizations.--Masonry.--New ground for fear\r\nwas now found in the spread of secret organizations, which were\r\ndenounced as Free Masonry. This is a very ancient institution which,\r\nin Protestant countries like England and America, has a very large\r\nmembership, and in these countries its aims are wholly respectable. It\r\nhas never in any way been connected with sedition or other unworthy\r\nmovements. Its services are, in fact, largely of a religious character\r\nand it possesses a beautiful and elaborate Christian ritual; but in\r\nLatin countries Masonry has been charged with political intrigue and\r\nthe encouragement of infidelity, and this has resulted in clerical\r\nopposition to the order wherever found. The first Masonic lodge in the\r\nPhilippines was established about 1861 and was composed entirely of\r\nSpaniards. It was succeeded by others with Filipino membership, and\r\nin one way or another seems to have inspired many secret organizations.\r\n\r\nThe \"Liga Filipina,\" and Dr. Rizal.--Large numbers of Filipinos were\r\nnow working, if not for independence, at least for the expulsion of the\r\nfriars; and while this feeling should have been met by a statesmanlike\r\nand liberal policy of reform, the government constantly resorted to\r\nmeasures of repression, which little by little changed the movement\r\nfor reformation into revolution.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the \"Liga Filipina,\" was formed by a number of the\r\nyounger Filipino patriots, chief among whom was Dr. Jose Rizal y\r\nMercado. Rizal, by his gifts, his noble character, and his sad fate,\r\nhas gained a supreme place in the hearts of Filipinos and in the\r\nhistory of the Islands. He was born in 1861 at Calamba, on Laguna de\r\nBay, and even as a child he was affected with sadness at the memory of\r\nthe events of 1872 and with the backward and unhappy condition of his\r\ncountrymen. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Ateneo Municipal in\r\nManila, and his family having means, he was enabled to study in Spain,\r\nwhere he took a degree in medicine, and later to travel and study in\r\nFrance, England, and Germany.\r\n\r\nIt was in this latter country that he produced his first novel,\r\nNoli Me Tangere. He had been a contributor to the Filipino paper\r\npublished in Spain, \"La Solidaridad,\" and, to further bring the\r\nconditions and needs of his country to more public notice, he wrote\r\nthis novel dealing with Tagalog life as represented at his old home on\r\nLaguna de Bay and in the city of Manila. Later he published a sequel,\r\nEl Filibusterismo, in which even more courageously and significantly\r\nare set forth his ideas for reform.\r\n\r\nHis work made him many enemies, and on his return to Manila he found\r\nhimself in danger and was obliged to leave. He returned again in 1893,\r\nand was immediately arrested and sentenced to deportation to Dapitan,\r\nMindanao. Here he remained quietly in the practice of his profession\r\nfor some years.\r\n\r\nThe Katipunan.--Meanwhile the ideas which had been agitated by the\r\nwealthy and educated Filipinos had worked their way down to the\r\npoor and humble classes. They were now shared by the peasant and\r\nthe fisherman. Especially in those provinces where the religious\r\norders owned estates and took as rental a portion of the tenants'\r\ncrop, there was growing hatred and hostility to the friars. The\r\n\"Liga Filipina\" had been composed of cultivated and moderate men,\r\nwho while pressing for reform were not inclined to radical extremes,\r\nnor to obtain their ends by violent means.\r\n\r\nBut there now grew up and gradually spread, until it had its\r\nbranches and members in all the provinces surrounding Manila, a\r\nsecret association composed largely of the uneducated classes, whose\r\nobject was independence of Spain, and whose members, having little to\r\nlose, were willing to risk all. This was the society which has since\r\nbecome famous under the name of \"Katipunan.\" This secret association\r\nwas organized in Cavite about 1892. Its president and founder was\r\nAndres Bonifacio. Its objects were frankly to expel the friars, and,\r\nif possible, to destroy the Spanish government.\r\n\r\nRebellion of 1896.--A general attack and slaughter of the Spaniards\r\nwas planned for the 20th of August, 1896. The plot was discovered\r\nby the priest of Binondo, Padre Gil, who learned of the movement\r\nthrough the wife of one of the conspirators, and within a few hours\r\nthe government had seized several hundred persons who were supposed to\r\nbe implicated. The arrests included many rich and prominent Filipinos,\r\nand at the end of some weeks the Spanish prisons contained over five\r\nthousand suspects. Over one thousand of these were almost immediately\r\nexiled to far-distant Spanish prisons--Fernando Po, on the west coast\r\nof Africa, and the fortress of Ceuta, on the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Katipunan was organizing its forces for struggle. On\r\nthe 26th of August, one thousand insurgents attacked Caloocan,\r\nand four days later a pitched battle was fought at San Juan del\r\nMonte. In this last fight the insurgents suffered great loss,\r\ntheir leader, Valenzuela, was captured and, with three companions,\r\nshot on the Campo de Bagumbayan. The rising continued, however,\r\nand the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan, and Nueva Ecija were soon in\r\nfull rebellion. The center of revolt, however, proved to be Cavite,\r\nThis province was almost immediately cleared of Spaniards, except the\r\nlong neck of land containing the town of Cavite and protected by the\r\nfleet. Here the insurgents received some organization under a young\r\nman, who had been prominent in the Katipunan--Emilio Aguinaldo.\r\n\r\nThe governor-general, Blanco, a humane man, who afterwards for a short\r\ntime commanded in Cuba, was recalled, and General Polavieja replaced\r\nhim. The Spanish army at the beginning of the revolt had consisted\r\nof but fifteen hundred troops, but so serious was the revolt regarded\r\nthat Spain, although straining every energy at the moment to end the\r\nrebellion in Cuba, strengthened the forces in the Philippines, until\r\nPolavieja had an army of twenty-eight thousand Spaniards assisted by\r\nseveral loyal Filipino regiments. With this army a fierce campaign\r\nin Cavite province was conducted, which after fifty-two days' hard\r\nfighting ended in the defeat of the insurgents and the scattering of\r\ntheir forces.\r\n\r\nDeath of Dr. Rizal.--For the moment it looked as though the rebellion\r\nmight pass. Then the Spanish government of Polavieja disgraced itself\r\nby an act as wanton and cruel as it was inhuman and impolitic.\r\n\r\nFour years Dr. Rizal had spent in exile at Dapitan. He had lived\r\nquietly and under surveillance, and it was impossible that he could\r\nhave had any share in this rebellion of 1898. Wearied, however, with\r\nhis inactivity, he solicited permission to go as an army doctor to the\r\ndreadful Spanish hospitals in Cuba. This request was granted in July,\r\nand Rizal had the misfortune to arrive in Manila at the very moment\r\nof discovery of the rebellion in August. Governor Blanco hastened to\r\nsend him to Spain with a most kindly letter to the minister of war,\r\nin which he vouched for his independence of the events which were\r\ntaking place in Manila.\r\n\r\nHis enemies, however, could not see him escape. Their persecution\r\nfollowed him to the Peninsula, and, upon his arrival in Spain, Rizal\r\nwas at once arrested and sent back to Manila a prisoner. His friend\r\nBlanco had gone. Polavieja, the friend and tool of the reactionary\r\nparty, was busy punishing by imprisonment, banishment or death all\r\nFilipinos who could be shown to have the slightest part or association\r\nin the movement for reform. And by this clique Dr. Rizal was sentenced\r\nto execution. He was shot early on the morning of December 30,\r\n1896. [94] At his death the insurrection flamed out afresh. It now\r\nspread to Pangasinan, Zambales, and Ilocos.\r\n\r\nEnd of the Revolt by Promises of Reform.--Polavieja returned to Spain,\r\nand was succeeded by Gen. Primo de Rivera, who arrived in the spring\r\nof 1897. The Spanish troops had suffered several recent reverses and\r\nthe country swarmed with insurgents. The policy of Primo de Rivera\r\nwas to gain by diplomacy where the energy of his predecessor had\r\nfailed. In July, 1897, an amnesty proclamation was issued, and in\r\nAugust the governor-general opened negotiations with Aguinaldo, whose\r\nheadquarters were now in the mountains of Angat in Bulacan. Primo\r\nde Rivera urged the home government to make some reforms, which\r\nwould greatly lessen the political importance of the friars. He\r\nwas vehemently opposed by the latter, but it was probably upon the\r\npromise of reform that Aguinaldo and his fellow-insurgents agreed,\r\nfor the payment of 1,700,000 pesos, to surrender their arms, dismiss\r\nthe insurgent forces, and themselves retire from the Islands. This\r\nagreement was made, and on December 27, 1897, Aguinaldo left the port\r\nof Sual for Hongkong.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Misrule Ended.--Conditions in the provinces still continued\r\nvery unsatisfactory, and in its very last hours the Spanish government\r\nlost the remnant of its prestige with the people by a massacre in\r\nCalle Camba, Binondo, of a company of Bisayan sailors. Ten days after\r\nthis occurrence a revolt blazed out on the island of Cebu. Had events\r\ntaken their course, what would have been the final conclusion of the\r\nstruggle between Spaniards and Filipinos it is impossible to say. On\r\nthe 25th day of April the United States declared war upon Spain,\r\nand the first day of May an American fleet reached Manila harbor,\r\nand in the naval fight off Cavite, Spanish dominion, which had lasted\r\nwith only one brief interruption for 332 years, was broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nAMERICA AND THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginning of a New Era.--With the passing of the Spanish sovereignty\r\nto the Americans, a new era began in the Philippines. Already the\r\nold Spanish rule seems so far removed that we can begin to think of\r\nit without feeling and study it without prejudice.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the United States of America.--The American nation is\r\nthe type of the New World. Beginning in a group of colonies, planted\r\nhalf a century later than the settlement of the Philippines, it has\r\nhad a development unparalleled in the history of states. Although\r\npeopled by emigrants from Europe, who rigidly preserved both their\r\npurity of race and pride of ancestry, the American colonists, at the\r\nend of a century, were far separated in spirit and institutions from\r\nthe Old World.\r\n\r\nStruggle with the wilderness and with the savage produced among them\r\na society more democratic and more independent than Europe had ever\r\nknown; while their profound religious convictions saved the colonists\r\nfrom barbarism and intellectual decline. It can truthfully be held,\r\nthat in 1775, at the outbreak of the American Revolution, the colonists\r\nhad abler men and greater political ability than the mother-country of\r\nEngland. It was these men who, at the close of the Revolution, framed\r\nthe American Constitution, the greatest achievement in the history of\r\npublic law. This nation, endowed at its commencement with so precious\r\nan inheritance of political genius, felt its civil superiority to the\r\nilliberal or ineffective governments of Europe, and this feeling has\r\nproduced in Americans a supreme and traditional confidence in their own\r\nforms of government and democratic standards of life. Certainly their\r\nhistory contains much to justify the choice of their institutions.\r\n\r\nA hundred and twenty-five years ago, these colonies were a small nation\r\nof 2,500,000 people, occupying no more than the Atlantic coast of\r\nthe continent. Great mountain chains divided them from the interior,\r\nwhich was overrun by the fiercest and most warlike type of man that\r\nthe races have produced--the American Indian. With an energy which\r\nhas shown no diminishing from generation to generation, the American\r\nbroke through these mountain chains, subdued the wilderness, conquered\r\nthe Indian tribes, and in the space of three generations was master\r\nof the continent of North America.\r\n\r\nEven while engaged in the War for Independence, the American\r\nfrontiersman crossed the Appalachians and secured Kentucky and the\r\nNorthwest Territory, and with them the richest and most productive\r\nregions of the Temperate Zone,--the Mississippi Valley. In 1803, the\r\ngreat empire of Louisiana, falling from the hand of France, was added\r\nto the American nation. In 1818, Florida was ceded by Spain, and in\r\n1857, as a result of war with Mexico, came the Greater West and the\r\nPacific seaboard. This vast dominion, nearly three thousand miles in\r\nwidth from east to west, has been peopled by natural increase and by\r\nimmigration from Europe, until, at the end of the nineteenth century,\r\nthe American nation numbered seventy-four million souls.\r\n\r\nThis development has taken place without fundamental change in the\r\nconstitution or form of government, without loss of individual liberty,\r\nand constantly increasing national prosperity. Moreover, the States\r\nhave survived the Civil War, the most bloody and persistently fought\r\nwar of all modern centuries--a war in which a million soldiers fell,\r\nand to sustain which three and a half billion dollars in gold were\r\nexpended out of the national treasury. This war accomplished the\r\nabolition of negro slavery, the greatest economic revolution ever\r\neffected by a single blow.\r\n\r\nSuch in brief is the history of the American nation, so gifted with\r\npolitical intelligence, so driven by sleepless energy, so proud of\r\nits achievements, and inwardly so contemptuous of the more polished\r\nbut less liberal life of the Old World. Europe has never understood\r\nthis nation, and not until a few years ago did Europeans dream of\r\nits progress and its power.\r\n\r\nRelation of the United States to South American Republics.--Toward\r\nthe republics of Spanish America the United States has always stood\r\nin a peculiar relation. These countries achieved their independence of\r\nSpain under the inspiration of the success of the United States. Their\r\ngovernments were framed in imitation of the American, and in spite of\r\nthe turbulence and disorder of their political life, the United States\r\nhas always felt and manifested a strong sympathy for these states as\r\nfellow-republics. She has moreover pledged herself to the maintenance\r\nof their integrity against the attacks of European powers. This\r\nposition of the United States in threatening with resistance the\r\nattempt of any European power to seize American territory is known\r\nas the Monroe Doctrine, because it was first declared by President\r\nMonroe in 1823.\r\n\r\nSympathy of American People for the Oppressed Cubans.--The fact that\r\nthe American nation attained its own independence by revolution has\r\nmade the American people give ready sympathy to the cause of the\r\nrevolutionist. The people of Cuba, who made repeated ineffective\r\nstruggles against Spanish sovereignty, always had the good wishes\r\nof the American people. By international usage, however, one nation\r\nmay not recognize or assist revolutionists against a friendly power\r\nuntil their independence is practically effected.\r\n\r\nThus, when rebellion broke out afresh in Cuba in 1894, the United\r\nStates government actively suppressed the lending of assistance to\r\nthe Cubans, as was its duty, although the American people themselves\r\nheartily wished Cuba free. The war in Cuba dragged along for years and\r\nbecame more and more merciless. The passions of Cubans and Spaniards\r\nwere so inflamed that quarter was seldom given, and prisoners were\r\nnot spared. Spain poured her troops into the island until there were\r\n120,000 on Cuban soil, but the rebellion continued.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish have always been merciless in dealing with\r\nrevolutionists. Americans, on the other hand, have always conceded\r\nthe moral right of a people to resist oppressive government, and in\r\nthe entire history of the United States there has scarcely been a\r\nsingle punishment for political crime. Although probably the fiercest\r\nwar in history was the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865, there\r\nwas not a single execution for treason. Thus the stories of the\r\nconstant executions of political prisoners, on an island in sight\r\nof its own shores, greatly exasperated America, as did the policy of\r\nGovernor-general Weyler, which was excessive in its severity.\r\n\r\nWar with Spain.--Destruction of the \"Maine.\"--As the contest proceeded\r\nwithout sign of termination, the patience of the American people grew\r\nless. Then, February 15, 1898, occurred one of the most deplorable\r\nevents of recent times. The American battleship \"Maine,\" lying in the\r\nharbor of Havana, was, in the night, blown to destruction by mine or\r\ntorpedo, killing 266 American officers and sailors. It is impossible\r\nto believe that so dastardly an act was done with the knowledge of\r\nthe higher Spanish officials; but the American people rightly demanded\r\nthat a government such as Spain maintained in Cuba, unable to prevent\r\nsuch an outrage upon the vessel of a friendly power, and that could\r\nneither suppress its rebellion nor wage war humanely, should cease.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of War.--On April 19th the American Congress demanded\r\nthat Spain withdraw from the island and recognize the independence of\r\nCuba. This was practically a declaration of war. Spain indignantly\r\nrefused, and resolved upon resistance. Unfortunately, the ignorant\r\nEuropean press claimed for Spain military and naval superiority.\r\n\r\nThe war was brief, and was an overwhelming disaster to Spain. Every\r\nvessel of her proud navy that came under the fire of American guns\r\nwas destroyed.\r\n\r\nFor a few months battle raged along the coasts of Cuba, and then\r\nSpain sued for peace.\r\n\r\nDewey's Victory in Manila Bay.--But meanwhile the war, begun without\r\nthe slightest reference to the Philippine Islands, had brought about\r\nsurprising consequences here.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the war, both Spain and the United States had\r\nsquadrons in Asiatic waters. The Spanish fleet lay at Cavite, the\r\nAmerican ships gathered at Hongkong. Immediately on the declaration of\r\nwar, the American naval commander, Dewey, was ordered to destroy the\r\nSpanish fleet, which was feared on the Pacific coast of America. Dewey\r\nentered the Bay of Manila in darkness on the morning of May 1st,\r\nand made direct for the Spanish vessels at Cavite. His fleet was the\r\nmore powerful and immeasurably the more efficient. In a few hours\r\nthe Spanish navy was utterly destroyed and Manila lay at the mercy\r\nof his guns.\r\n\r\nA New Insurrection, under Aguinaldo.--At this signal catastrophe\r\nto Spain, the smoldering insurrection in the Islands broke out\r\nafresh. The Spanish troops not in Manila were driven in upon their\r\nposts, and placed in a position of siege. The friars, so hated by the\r\nrevolutionists, were captured in large numbers and were in some cases\r\nkilled. With the permission and assistance of the American authorities,\r\nAguinaldo returned from Singapore, and landed at Cavite. Here he\r\nimmediately headed anew the Philippine insurrection.\r\n\r\nCapture of Manila.--Troops were dispatched from San Francisco for the\r\ncapture of Manila. By the end of July, 8,500 men lay in the transports\r\noff Cavite. They were landed at the little estuary of Paranaque,\r\nand advanced northwards upon Fort San Antonio and the defenses of\r\nMalate. The Spaniards behind the city's defenses, although outnumbering\r\nthe Americans, were sick and dispirited. One attempt was made to drive\r\nback the invading army, but on the following day the Americans swept\r\nthrough the defenses and line of blockhouses, and Manila capitulated\r\n(August 13, 1898).\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos had scarcely participated in the attack on the city, and\r\nthey were excluded from occupying it after its surrender. This act was\r\njustified, because the Filipino forces had been very recently raised,\r\nthe soldiers were undisciplined, and had they entered the city, with\r\npassions as they were inflamed, it was feared by the Americans that\r\ntheir officers might not be able to keep them from looting and crime.\r\n\r\nMisunderstanding between Americans and Filipinos.--Up to this point,\r\nthe relations between the American and Filipino armies had been\r\nfriendly. But here began that misunderstanding and distrust which\r\nfor so many months were to alienate these two peoples and imbitter\r\ntheir intercourse.\r\n\r\nProvisional Government of the Filipinos.--In the interval between\r\nthe destruction of the Spanish fleet and the capture of Manila,\r\nthe Filipinos in Cavite had organized a provisional government and\r\nproclaimed the independence of the archipelago.\r\n\r\nAmerican Ideas in Regard to the Philippines.--The idea of returning\r\nthese islands to the Spanish power was exceedingly repugnant to\r\nAmerican sentiment. Spain's attitude toward revolutionists was well\r\nunderstood in America, and the Filipinos had acted as America's friends\r\nand allies. On the other hand, the American government was unwilling\r\nto turn over to the newly organized Filipino republic the government\r\nof the archipelago. It was felt in America, and with reason, that\r\nthis Filipino government was not truly representative of all the\r\npeople in the Philippines, that the Filipino leaders were untried\r\nmen, and that the people themselves had not had political training and\r\nexperience. The United States, having overthrown the Spanish government\r\nhere, was under obligation to see that the government established in\r\nits place would represent all and do injustice to none. The Filipinos\r\nwere very slightly known to Americans, but their educated class was\r\nbelieved to be small and their political ability unproven. Thus, no\r\nassurances were given to the Filipino leaders that their government\r\nwould be recognized, or that their wishes would be consulted in the\r\nfuture of the Islands. In fact, these matters could be settled only\r\nby action of the American Congress, which was late in assembling and\r\nslow to act.\r\n\r\nThe Terms of Peace.--Spain and America were now negotiating terms of\r\npeace. These negotiations were conducted at Paris, and dragged on\r\nduring many critical weeks. The Filipinos were naturally very much\r\nconcerned over the outcome.\r\n\r\nFinally, the American government demanded of Spain that she cede the\r\nIslands to the United States and accept the sum of $20,000,000 gold,\r\nfor public works and improvements which she had made.\r\n\r\nSuspicions of the Filipino Leaders.--These terms became known in\r\nDecember, 1898. They served to awaken the worst suspicions of the\r\nFilipino leaders. Many believed that they were about to exchange\r\nthe oppressive domination of Spain for the selfish and equally\r\noppressive domination of America. There is reason to believe that some\r\nleaders counseled patience, and during the succeeding months made a\r\nconstant effort to maintain the peace, but the radical party among\r\nthe Filipinos was led by a man of real gifts and fiery disposition,\r\nAntonio Luna. He had received an education in Europe, had had some\r\ninstruction in military affairs, and when in September the Filipino\r\ngovernment was transferred to Malolos, Luna became the general in\r\nchief of the military forces. He was also editor of the most radical\r\nFilipino newspaper, \"La Independencia.\"\r\n\r\nNew Filipino Government.--On January 4, 1899, President McKinley\r\nissued a special message to General Otis, commanding the armies of the\r\nUnited States in the Philippines, declaring that American sovereignty\r\nmust be recognized without conditions. It was thought in the United\r\nStates that a firm declaration of this kind would be accepted by\r\nthe Filipinos and that they would not dare to make resistance. The\r\nintentions of the American president and nation, as subsequent events\r\nhave proven, were to deal with the Filipinos with great liberality;\r\nbut the president's professions were not trusted by the Filipinos,\r\nand the result of Mr. McKinley's message was to move them at once to\r\nframe an independent government and to decide on war.\r\n\r\nThis new government was framed at Malolos, Bulacan, by a congress\r\nwith representatives from most of the provinces of central Luzon. The\r\n\"Malolos Constitution\" was proclaimed January 23, 1899, and Don Emilio\r\nAguinaldo was elected president. The cabinet, or ministry, included\r\nDon Apolinario Mabini, secretary of state; Don Teodoro Sandico,\r\nsecretary of interior; General Baldomero Aguinaldo, secretary of war;\r\nGeneral Mariano Trias, secretary of treasury; Don Engracio Gonzaga,\r\nsecretary of public instruction and agriculture.\r\n\r\nWar with the Americans.--Battle of Manila.--The Filipino forces were\r\nimpatient for fighting, and attack on the American lines surrounding\r\nManila began on the night of February 4th. It is certain that battle\r\nhad been decided upon and in preparation for some time, and that\r\nfighting would have been begun in any case, before the arrival\r\nof reenforcements from America; but the attack was precipitated a\r\nlittle early by the killing at San Juan Bridge of a Filipino officer\r\nwho refused to halt when challenged by an American sentry. On that\r\nmemorable and dreadful night, the battle raged with great fury along\r\nthe entire circle of defenses surrounding the city, from Tondo\r\non the north to Fort San Antonio de Abad, south of the suburb of\r\nMalate. Along three main avenues from the north, east, and south\r\nthe Filipinos attempted to storm and enter the capital, but although\r\nthey charged with reckless bravery, and for hours sustained a bloody\r\ncombat, they had fatally underestimated the fighting qualities of\r\nthe American soldier.\r\n\r\nThe volunteer regiments of the American army came almost entirely from\r\nthe western United States, where young men are naturally trained to\r\nthe use of arms, and are imbued by inheritance with the powerful and\r\naggressive qualities of the American frontier. When morning broke,\r\nthe Filipino line of attack had, at every point, been shattered and\r\nthrown back, and the Americans had advanced their positions on the\r\nnorth to Caloocan, on the east to the Water Works and the Mariquina\r\nValley, and on the south to Pasay.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of War.--Unfortunately, during the night attack and before\r\nthe disaster to Filipino arms was apparent, Aguinaldo had launched\r\nagainst the United States a declaration of war. This declaration\r\nprevented the Americans from trusting the Filipino overtures which\r\nfollowed this battle, and peace was not made.\r\n\r\nThe Malolos Campaign.--On March 25th began the American advance upon\r\nthe Filipino capital of Malolos. This Malolos campaign, as it is\r\nusually called, occupied six days, and ended in the driving of the\r\nFilipino army and government from their capital. Hard fighting took\r\nplace in the first days of this advance, and two extremely worthy\r\nAmerican officers were killed, Colonels Egbert and Stotsenberg.\r\n\r\nThe Filipino army was pursued in its retreat as far as Calumpit, where\r\non the southern bank of the Rio Grande de Pampanga the American line\r\nrested during the height of the rainy season. During this interval\r\nthe volunteer regiments, whose terms of service had long expired,\r\nwere returned to the States, and their places taken by regiments of\r\nthe regular army.\r\n\r\nThe American Army.--The American army at that time, besides the\r\nartillery, consisted of twenty-five regiments of infantry and ten of\r\ncavalry. Congress now authorized the organization of twenty-four new\r\nregiments of infantry, to be known as the 26th to the 49th Regiments\r\nof U. S. Volunteers, and one volunteer regiment of cavalry, the 11th,\r\nfor a service of two years. These regiments were largely officered\r\nby men from civil life, familiar with a great variety of callings and\r\nprofessions,--men for the most part of fine character, whose services\r\nin the months that followed were very great not only in the field, but\r\nin gaining the friendship of the Filipino people and in representing\r\nthe character and intentions of the American government.\r\n\r\nAnti-War Agitators in America.--Through the summer of 1899 the war was\r\nnot pressed by the American general, nor were the negotiations with\r\nthe Filipino leaders conducted with success. The Filipinos were by no\r\nmeans dismayed. In spite of their reverses, they believed the conquest\r\nof the Islands impossible to foreign troops. Furthermore, the war had\r\nmet with tremendous opposition in America. Many Americans believed that\r\nthe war was against the fundamental rights of the Filipino people. They\r\nattacked the administration with unspeakable bitterness. They openly\r\nexpressed sympathy for the Filipino revolutionary cause, and for the\r\nspace of two years their encouragement was an important factor in\r\nsustaining the rebellion.\r\n\r\nSpread of the Insurrection.--In these same summer months the\r\nrevolutionary leaders spread their cause among the surrounding\r\nprovinces and islands. The spirit of resistance was prominent at first\r\nonly among the Tagalog, but gradually nearly all the Christianized\r\npopulation was united in resistance to the American occupation.\r\n\r\nOccupation of Negros.--The Americans had meanwhile occupied\r\nIloilo and the Bisayas, and shortly afterwards the presidios in\r\nMindanao surrendered by the Spaniards. In Negros, also, exceptional\r\ncircumstances had transpired. The people in this island invited\r\nAmerican sovereignty; and Gen. James Smith, sent to the island in March\r\nas governor, assisted the people in forming a liberal government,\r\nthrough which insurrection and disorder in that island were largely\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nDeath of General Luna.--With the cessation of heavy rains, the\r\nfighting was begun again in northern Luzon. The Filipino army had\r\nits headquarters in Tarlac, and its lines occupied the towns of the\r\nprovinces of Pangasinan and Nueva Ecija, stretching in a long line of\r\nposts from the Zambales Mountains almost to the upper waters of the\r\nRio Pampanga. It was still well armed, provisioned, and resolute; but\r\nthe brilliant, though wayward, organizer of this army was dead. The\r\nNationalist junta, which had directed the Philippine government and\r\narmy, had not been able to reconcile its differences. It is reported\r\nthat Luna aspired to a dictatorship. He was killed by soldiers of\r\nAguinaldo at Cabanatuan.\r\n\r\nThe Campaign in Northern Luzon.--The American generals now determined\r\nupon a strategic campaign. General MacArthur was to command an\r\nadvance up the railroad from Calumpit upon Tarlac; General Lawton,\r\nwith a flying column of swift infantry and cavalry, was to make a\r\nflanking movement eastward through Nueva Ecija and hem the Filipino\r\nforces in upon the east. Meanwhile, General Wheaton was to convey a\r\nforce by transport to the Gulf of Lingayen, to throw a cordon across\r\nthe Ilocano coast that should cut off the retreat of the Filipino army\r\nnorthward. As a strategic movement, this campaign was only partially\r\nsuccessful. MacArthur swept northward, crushing the Filipino line on\r\nhis front, his advance being led by the active regiment of General\r\nJ. Franklin Bell. Lawton's column scoured the country eastward,\r\nmarching with great rapidity and tremendous exertions. Swollen\r\nrivers were crossed with great loss of life, and the column,\r\ncutting loose from its supplies, was frequently in need of food. It\r\nwas in this column that the Filipino first saw with amazement the\r\ngreat American cavalry horse, so large beside the small pony of\r\nthe Philippines. Lawton's descent was so swift that the Philippine\r\ngovernment and staff narrowly escaped capture.\r\n\r\nOn the night of November 11th, the Filipino generals held their\r\nlast council of war at Bayambang on the Rio Agno, and resolved upon\r\ndispersal. Meanwhile, Wheaton had landed at San Fabian, upon the\r\nsouthern Ilocano coast, but his force was insufficient to establish\r\nan effective cordon, and on the night of November 15th Aguinaldo,\r\nwith a small party of ministers and officers, closely pursued by the\r\ncavalry of Lawton under the command of General Young, slipped past,\r\nthrough the mountains of Pozorubio and Rosario, and escaped up the\r\nIlocano coast.\r\n\r\nThen began one of the most exciting pursuits in recent wars. The chase\r\nnever slackened, except in those repeated instances when for the moment\r\nthe trail of the Filipino general was lost. From Candon, Aguinaldo\r\nturned eastward through the comandancias of Lepanto and Bontoc, into\r\nthe wild Igorrote country of the Cordillera Central. The trail into\r\nLepanto leads over the lofty mountains through the precipitous Tila\r\nPass. On the summit, in what was regarded as an impregnable position,\r\nGregorio del Pilar, little more than a boy, but a brigadier-general,\r\nwith a small force of soldiers, the remnant of his command, attempted\r\nto cover the retreat of his president. But a battalion of the\r\n33d Infantry, under Major March, carried the pass, with the total\r\ndestruction of Pilar's command, he himself falling amid the slain.\r\n\r\nCapture of Aguinaldo.--Major March then pursued Aguinaldo into\r\nBontoc and thence southward into the wild and mountainous territory\r\nof Quiangan. On Christmas night, 1899, the American soldiers camped\r\non the crest of the Cordillera, within a few miles of the Igorrote\r\nvillage where the Filipino force was sleeping. Both parties were\r\nbroken down and in dire distress through the fierceness of the flight\r\nand pursuit, but for several weeks longer Aguinaldo's party was able\r\nto remain in these mountains and elude its pursuers. A month later,\r\nhis trail was finally lost in the valley of the Cagayan. He and his\r\nsmall party had passed over the exceedingly difficult trail through\r\nthe Sierra Madre Mountains, to the little Tagalog town of Palanan\r\nnear the Pacific coast. Here, almost entirely cut off from active\r\nparticipation in the insurrection, Aguinaldo remained until June of\r\n1901, when he was captured by the party of General Funston.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks following the disintegration of the Filipino army, the\r\ncountry appeared to be pacified and the insurrection over. The new\r\nregiments arriving from the United States, an expedition was formed\r\nunder General Schwan, which in December and January marched southward\r\nthrough Cavite and Laguna provinces and occupied Batangas, Tayabas, and\r\nthe Camarines. Other regiments were sent to the Bisayas and to northern\r\nLuzon, until every portion of the archipelago, except the islands of\r\nMindoro and Palawan, contained large forces of American troops.\r\n\r\nReorganization of the Filipino Army.--The Filipinos had, by no means,\r\nhowever, abandoned the contest, and this period of quiet was simply\r\na calm while the insurgent forces were perfecting their organization\r\nand preparing for a renewal of the conflict under a different form. It\r\nbeing found impossible for a Filipino army to keep the field, there\r\nwas effected a secret organization for the purpose of maintaining\r\nirregular warfare through every portion of the archipelago. The Islands\r\nwere partitioned into a great number of districts or \"zones.\" At\r\nthe head of each was a zone commander, usually with the rank of\r\ngeneral. The operations of these men were, to a certain extent, guided\r\nby the counsel or directions of the secret revolutionary juntas in\r\nManila or Hongkong, but, in fact, they were practically absolute and\r\nindependent, and they exercised extraordinary powers. They recruited\r\ntheir own forces and commissioned subordinate commanders. They levied\r\n\"contributions\" upon towns, owners of haciendas, and individuals of\r\nevery class, and there was a secret civil or municipal organization\r\nfor collecting these revenues. The zone commanders, moreover, exercised\r\nthe terrible power of execution by administrative order.\r\n\r\nAssassination of Filipinos.--Many of the Filipino leaders were\r\nnecessarily not well instructed in those rules for the conduct of\r\nwarfare which civilized peoples have agreed upon as being humane\r\nand honorable. Many of them tried, especially in the latter months\r\nof the war, when understanding was more widely diffused, to make\r\ntheir conduct conform to international usage; but the revolutionary\r\njunta had committed the great crime of ordering the punishment by\r\nassassination of all Filipinos who failed to support the insurgent\r\ncause. No possible justification, in the light of modern morality,\r\ncan be found for such a step as this. The very worst passions were\r\nlet loose in carrying out this policy. Scores of unfortunate men were\r\nassassinated, many of them as the results of private enmity. Endless\r\nblackmail was extorted and communities were terrorized from one end\r\nof the archipelago to the other.\r\n\r\nIrregular Warfare of the Filipinos.--Through the surrender of\r\nSpanish forces, the capture of the arsenals of Cavite and Olongapo,\r\nand by purchase through Hongkong, the revolutionary government\r\npossessed between thirty thousand and forty thousand rifles. These\r\narms were distributed to the different military zones, and the\r\nsecret organization which existed in each municipality received its\r\nproportion. These guns were secreted by the different members of the\r\ncommand, except when occasion arose for effecting a surprise or making\r\nan attack. There were no general engagements, but in some towns there\r\nwas almost nightly shooting. Pickets and small detachments were cut\r\noff, and roads became so unsafe throughout most of the archipelago\r\nthat there was no travel by Americans except under heavy escort. For a\r\nlong time, also, the orders of the commanding general were so lenient\r\nthat it was impossible to punish properly this conduct when it was\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nDeath of General Lawton.--The American army, in its attempt to garrison\r\nevery important town in the Islands, was cut up into as many as 550\r\nsmall detachments of post garrisons. Thus, while there were eventually\r\nsixty thousand American soldiers in the Islands, it was rare for as\r\nmany as five hundred to take the field, and most of the engagements\r\nof the year 1900 were by small detachments of fifty to one hundred men.\r\n\r\nIt was in one of these small expeditions that the American army\r\nsuffered the greatest single loss of the war. A few miles east of\r\nManila is the beautiful Mariquina Valley, from which is derived the\r\ncity's supply of water, and the headwaters of this pretty stream lie in\r\nthe wild and picturesque fastness of San Mateo and Montalban. Although\r\nscarce a dozen miles from the capital and the headquarters of a\r\nFilipino brigade, San Mateo was not permanently occupied by the\r\nAmericans until after the 18th of December, 1899, when a force under\r\nGeneral Lawton was led around through the hills to surprise the town.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning the American force came pouring down over the\r\nhills that lie across the river from the village. They were met by\r\na brisk fire from the insurgent command scattered along the banks of\r\nthe river and in a sugar hacienda close to the stream. Here Lawton,\r\nconspicuous in white uniform and helmet, accompanying, as was his\r\ncustom, the front line of skirmishers, was struck by a bullet and\r\ninstantly killed.\r\n\r\nFilipino Leaders Sent to Guam.--In November, 1900, after the reelection\r\nin the United States of President McKinley, a much more vigorous policy\r\nof war was inaugurated. In this month General MacArthur, commanding\r\nthe division, issued a notable general order, defining and explaining\r\nthe laws of war which were being violated, and threatening punishment\r\nby imprisonment of those guilty of such conduct. Some thousands of\r\nFilipinos under this order were arrested and imprisoned. Thirty-nine\r\nleaders, among them the high-minded but irreconcilable Mabini, were\r\nin December, 1900, sent to a military prison on the island of Guam.\r\n\r\nCampaigning was much more vigorously prosecuted in all military\r\ndistricts. By this time all the American officers had become familiar\r\nwith the insurgent leaders, and these were now obliged to leave the\r\ntowns and establish cuartels in remote barrios and in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThese measures, pursued through the winter of 1900-01, broke the\r\npower of the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Civil Commission.--Another very influential factor in\r\nproducing peace resulted from the presence and labors of the Civil\r\nPhilippine Commission. These gentlemen, Judge William H. Taft, Judge\r\nLuke E. Wright, Judge Henry C. Ide, Professor Dean C. Worcester,\r\nand Professor Bernard Moses, were appointed by the president in the\r\nspring of 1900 to legislate for the Islands and to prepare the way\r\nfor the establishment of civil government. President McKinley's letter\r\nof instructions to this commission will probably be ranked as one of\r\nthe ablest and most notable public papers in American history.\r\n\r\nThe commission reached the Islands in June and began their legislative\r\nwork on September 1st. This body of men, remarkable for their high\r\ncharacter, was able at last to bring about an understanding with the\r\nFilipino leaders and to assure them of the unselfish and honorable\r\npurposes of the American government. Thus, by the early winter\r\nof 1900-01 many Filipino gentlemen became convinced that the best\r\ninterests of the Islands lay in accepting American sovereignty, and\r\nthat they could honorably advocate the surrender of the insurgent\r\nforces. These men represented the highest attainments and most\r\ninfluential positions in the Islands. In December they formed an\r\nassociation known as the Federal Party, for the purpose of inducing the\r\nsurrender of military leaders, obedience to the American government,\r\nand the acceptance of peace.\r\n\r\nEnd of the Insurrection.--Under these influences, the insurrection,\r\nin the spring of 1901, went rapidly to pieces. Leader after leader\r\nsurrendered his forces and arms, and took the oath of allegiance and\r\nquietly returned home. By the end of June there were but two zone\r\ncommanders who had not surrendered,--General Malvar in Batangas,\r\nand General Lukban in Samar.\r\n\r\nThe First Civil Governor.--Peaceful conditions and security almost\r\nimmediately followed these surrenders and determined the president to\r\nestablish at once civil government. On July 4, 1901, this important\r\nstep was taken, Judge Taft, the president of the Philippine Commission,\r\ntaking office on that date as the first American civil governor of the\r\nPhilippines. On September 1st, the Philippine Commission was increased\r\nby the appointment of three Filipino members,--the Hon. T. H. Pardo\r\nde Tavera, M. D., the Hon. Benito Legarda, and the Hon. Jose Luzuriaga\r\nof Negros.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Commission has achieved a remarkable amount of\r\nlegislation of a very high order. From September, 1900, to the end\r\nof December, 1902, the commission passed no less than 571 acts of\r\nlegislation. Some of these were of very great importance and involved\r\nlong preparation and labor. Few administrative bodies have ever worked\r\nharder and with greater results than the Philippine Commission during\r\nthe first two years of its activity. The frame of government in all\r\nits branches had to be organized and set in motion, the civil and\r\ncriminal law liberalized, revenue provided, and public instruction\r\nremodeled on a very extensive scale.\r\n\r\nThe New Government.--The government is a very liberal one, and\r\none which gives an increasing opportunity for participation to the\r\nFilipinos. It includes what is called local self-government. There\r\nare in the Islands about 1,132 municipalities. In these the residents\r\npractically manage their own affairs. There are thirty-eight organized\r\nprovinces in the archipelago, in which the administration rests\r\nwith the Provincial Board composed of the governor, treasurer,\r\nand supervisor or engineer. The governor is elected for the\r\nterm of one year by the councilors of all the towns united in\r\nassembly. The treasurer and supervisor are appointed by the governor\r\nof the Philippine archipelago under the rules of the Civil Service\r\nBoard. The civil service is a subject which has commanded the special\r\nconsideration of the Commission. It gives equal opportunity to the\r\nFilipino and to the American to enter the public service and to gain\r\npublic promotion; and the Filipino is by law even given the preference\r\nwhere possessed of the requisite ability.\r\n\r\nThe Insular Government.--For the purposes of administration, the\r\ninsular, or central government of the Islands is divided into four\r\nbranches, called departments, each directed by a secretary who is\r\nalso a member of the Philippine Commission. These departments are,\r\ninterior, Secretary Worcester; finance and justice, Secretary Ide;\r\ncommerce and police, Secretary Wright; and public instruction,\r\nSecretary Moses, until January 1, 1903, and since that date Secretary\r\nSmith. Under each of these departments are a large number of bureaus,\r\nby which the many important activities of the government are performed.\r\n\r\nWe have only to examine a list of these bureaus to see how many-sided\r\nis the work which the government is performing. It is a veritable\r\ncommonwealth, complete in all the branches which demand the\r\nattention of modern governments. Thus, under the Department of the\r\nInterior, there is the Bureau of Public Health, with its extremely\r\nimportant duties of combating epidemic diseases and improving public\r\nsanitation, with its public hospitals, sanitariums, and charities;\r\nthe Bureau of Government Laboratories for making bacteriological and\r\nchemical investigations; a Bureau of Forestry; a Bureau of Mining;\r\nthe Philippine Weather Bureau; a Bureau of Agriculture; a Bureau of\r\nNon-Christian Tribes for conducting the government work in ethnology\r\nand for framing legislation for pagan and Mohammedan tribes; and a\r\nBureau of Public Lands.\r\n\r\nUnder the department of Commerce and Police are the Bureau of Posts;\r\nSignal Service; the Philippines Constabulary, really an insular army,\r\nwith its force of some sixty-five hundred officers and men; Prisons;\r\nthe Coast Guard and Transportation Service, with a fleet of about\r\ntwenty beautiful little steamers, nearly all of them newly built for\r\nthis service and named for islands of the archipelago; the Coast and\r\nGeodetic Survey, doing the much-needed work of charting the dangerous\r\ncoasts and treacherous waters of the archipelago; and the Bureau of\r\nEngineering, which has under its charge great public works, many of\r\nwhich are already under way.\r\n\r\nUnder the Department of Finance and Justice are the Insular Treasurer;\r\nthe Insular Auditor; the Bureau of Customs and Immigration; the\r\nBureau of Internal Revenue; the Insular Cold Storage and Ice Plant;\r\nand the great Bureau of Justice.\r\n\r\nUnder the Department of Public Instruction there is the Bureau of\r\nEducation in charge of the system of public schools; a Bureau of\r\nPrinting and Engraving, with a new and fully equipped plant; a Bureau\r\nof Architecture; a Bureau of Archives; a Bureau of Statistics; and\r\nthe Philippine Museum.\r\n\r\nRevenues and Expenditures.--The maintenance of these numerous\r\nactivities calls for an expenditure of large sums of money, but the\r\ninsular government and the Filipino people are fortunate in having\r\nhad their finances managed with exceptional ability. The revenues\r\nof the Islands for the past fiscal year have amounted to about\r\n$10,638,000, gold. Public expenditures, including the purchase\r\nof equipment such as the coast-guard fleet and the forwarding of\r\ngreat public works such as the improving of the harbor of Manila,\r\namounted during fiscal year of 1903 to about $9,150,000, gold. The\r\ngovernment has at all times preserved a good balance in its treasury;\r\nbut the past year has seen some diminution in the amount of revenues,\r\nowing to the great depreciation of silver money, the falling off of\r\nimports, the wide prevalence of cholera, and the poverty of many parts\r\nof the country as a result of war and the loss of livestock through\r\npest. To assist the government of the Philippines, the Congress of\r\nthe United States in February, 1903, with great and characteristic\r\ngenerosity appropriated the sum of $3,000,000, gold, as a free gift\r\nto the people and government of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe Judicial System.--Especially fortunate, also, have been the labors\r\nof the commission in establishing a judicial system and revising the\r\nSpanish law. The legal ability of the commission is unusually high. As\r\nat present constituted, the judicial system consists of a Supreme\r\nCourt composed of seven justices, three of whom at the present time\r\nare Filipinos, which, besides trying cases over which it has original\r\njurisdiction, hears cases brought on appeal from the Courts of First\r\nInstance, fifteen in number, which sit in different parts of the\r\nIslands. Each town, moreover, has its justices of the peace for the\r\ntrial of small cases and for holding preliminary examinations in cases\r\nof crimes. By the new Code of Civil Procedure, the administration of\r\njustice has been so simplified that there are probably no courts in\r\nthe world where justice can be more quickly secured than here.\r\n\r\nSystem of Public Schools.--Probably no feature of the American\r\ngovernment in the Islands has attracted more attention than the\r\nsystem of public schools. Popular education, while by no means wholly\r\nneglected under the Spanish government, was inadequate, and was\r\ncontinually opposed by the clerical and conservative Spanish forces,\r\nwho feared that the liberalizing of the Filipino people would be the\r\nloosening of the control of both Spanish state and church. On the\r\ncontrary, the success of the American government, as of any government\r\nin which the people participate, depends upon the intelligence and\r\neducation of the people. Thus, the American government is as anxious to\r\ndestroy ignorance and poverty as the Spanish government and the Spanish\r\nchurch were desirous of preserving these deeply unfortunate conditions.\r\n\r\nAmericans believe that if knowledge is generally spread among the\r\nFilipino people, if there can be a real understanding of the genius\r\nand purpose of our American institutions, there will come increasing\r\ncontent and satisfaction to dwell under American law. Thus, education\r\nwas early encouraged by the American army, and it received the first\r\nattention of the commission. The widespread system of public schools\r\nwhich now exists in these islands was organized by the first General\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction, Dr. Fred W. Atkinson, and by\r\nProfessor Bernard Moses of the Philippine Commission.\r\n\r\nInstruction in the English Language.--The basis of this public\r\ninstruction is the English language. This was early decided upon in\r\nview of the great number of Filipino dialects, the absence of a common\r\nnative language or literature, and the very moderate acquaintance\r\nwith Spanish by any except the educated class.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for the Filipino people that English has been\r\nintroduced here and that its knowledge is rapidly spreading. Knowledge\r\nof language is power, and the more widely spoken the tongue, the\r\ngreater the possession of the individual who acquires it. Of all the\r\nlanguages of the world, English is to-day the most widely spoken and is\r\nmost rapidly spreading. Moreover, English is preeminently the language\r\nof the Far East. From Yokohama to Australia, and from Manila to the\r\nIsthmus of Suez, English is the common medium of communication. It is\r\nthe language alike of business and of diplomacy. The Filipino people,\r\nso eager to participate in all the busy life of eastern Asia, so\r\nambitious to make their influence felt and their counsels regarded,\r\nwill be debarred from all this unless they master this mighty English\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nThe Filipino Assembly.--Thus, after four and a half years of\r\nAmerican occupation, the sovereignty of the United States has been\r\nestablished in the archipelago, and a form of government, unique\r\nin the history of colonial administration, inaugurated. One other\r\nstep in the contemplation of Congress, which will still further make\r\nthe government a government of the Filipino people, remains to be\r\ntaken. This is the formation of a Filipino assembly of delegates or\r\nrepresentatives, chosen by popular vote from all the Christianized\r\nprovinces of the archipelago. The recent census of the Philippines\r\nwill form the basis for the apportionment of this representation. This\r\nassembly will share the legislative power on all matters pertaining\r\nto the Christian people of the Philippines and those parts of the\r\nIslands inhabited by them. When this step shall have been taken,\r\nthe government of the Philippine Islands will be like the typical\r\nand peculiarly American form of government known as territorial.\r\n\r\nTerritorial Form of Government in the United States.--The American\r\nUnion is composed of a number of states or commonwealths which,\r\nwhile differing vastly in wealth and population, are on absolutely\r\nequal footing in the Union. The inhabitants of these states form\r\npolitically the American sovereignty. They elect the president and\r\nCongress, and through their state legislatures may change or amend\r\nthe form of the American state itself.\r\n\r\nBesides these states, there have always been large possessions\r\nof the nation called territories. These territories are extensive\r\ncountries, too sparsely inhabited or too undeveloped politically to\r\nbe admitted, in the judgment of the American Congress, to statehood\r\nin the Union. Their inhabitants do not have the right to vote for\r\nthe president; neither have they representation in the American\r\nCongress. These territories are governed by Congress, through\r\nterritorial governments, and over them Congress has full sovereign\r\npowers. That is, as the Supreme Court of the United States has decided\r\nand explained, while Congress when legislating for the states in the\r\nUnion has only those powers of legislation which have been specifically\r\ngranted by the Constitution, in legislating for the territories it has\r\nall the powers which the Constitution has not specifically denied. The\r\nonly limitations on Congress are those which, under the American\r\nsystem of public law, guarantee the liberty of the individual,--his\r\nfreedom of religious belief and worship; his right to just, open,\r\nand speedy trial; his right to the possession of his property; and\r\nother precious privileges, the result of centuries of development\r\nin the English-speaking race, which make up civil liberty. These\r\npriceless securities, which no power of the government can take away,\r\nabridge, or infringe, are as much the possession of the inhabitants\r\nof a territory as of a state. [95]\r\n\r\nThe government of these territories has varied greatly in form and\r\nmay be changed at any time by Congress, but it usually consists of a\r\ngovernor and supreme court, appointed by the president of the United\r\nStates, and a legislature elected by the people. Since 1783 there\r\nhas always been territory so held and governed by the United States,\r\nand if we may judge from the remarkable history of these regions, this\r\nform of government of dependent possessions is the most successful and\r\nmost advantageous to the territory itself that has ever been devised.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, the territories of the United States are Oklahoma,\r\nthe Indian Territory, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska, the Hawaiian\r\nIslands, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam.\r\n\r\nThe territorial form of government has frequently been regarded\r\nby American statesmen as a temporary condition to be followed\r\nat a comparatively early date by statehood. But after more than a\r\ncentury of development, territorial government, as shaped by Congress\r\nand as defined by the Supreme Court, shows itself so flexible and\r\nadvantageous that there is no reason why it should not be regarded\r\nas a permanent and final form. Whether it will long prevail in the\r\nPhilippines, depends very largely upon the political development and\r\nultimate desires of the Filipino people themselves. For the present,\r\nit is the only suitable form of government and the only form which\r\nit is statesmanlike to contemplate.\r\n\r\nFilipino Independence.--The events of the last few years\r\nseem to indicate that the American nation will not intrust the\r\nPhilippines with independence until they have immeasurably gained\r\nin political experience and social self-control. The question is\r\ntoo great to be discussed here, but this much may be said: The\r\nrapid march of international politics in this coming century will\r\nnot be favorable to the independence of the small and imperfectly\r\ndeveloped state. Independence, while it may fascinate the popular\r\nleader, may not be most advantageous for this people. Independence,\r\nunder present tendencies of international trade, means economic\r\nisolation. Independence, in the present age, compels preparedness\r\nfor war; preparedness for war necessitates the maintenance of\r\nstrong armies, the building of great navies, and the great economic\r\nburdens required to sustain these armaments. Especially would this\r\nbe true of an archipelago so exposed to attack, so surrounded by\r\nambitious powers, and so near the center of coming struggle, as\r\nare the Philippines. Japan, with a population of forty-two million,\r\nwonderful for their industry and economy, and passionately devoted to\r\ntheir emperor, is independent, but at great cost. The burden of her\r\nsplendid army and her modern navy weighs heavily upon her people,\r\nconsumes a large proportion of their earnings, and sometimes seems\r\nto be threatening to strain the resources of the nation almost to\r\nthe point of breaking.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of American Control.--Surely, a people is economically far\r\nmore privileged if, like the Philippines under the American government,\r\nor Australia under the British, they are compelled to sustain no\r\nportion of the burden of exterior defense. The navies of the United\r\nStates to-day protect the integrity of the Philippine archipelago. The\r\npower of a nation so strong and so terrible, when once aroused, that\r\nno country on the globe would think for a minute of wantonly molesting\r\nits territory, shields the Filipino from all outside interference\r\nand permits him to expend all his energy in the development of those\r\nabilities to which his temperament and endowment inspire him.\r\n\r\nAmerican government means freedom of opportunity. There is no\r\nhonorable pursuit, calling, or walk of life under heaven in which the\r\nFilipino may not now engage and in which he will not find his endeavors\r\nencouraged and his success met with generous appreciation. In politics,\r\nhis progress may be slow, because progress here is not the development\r\nof the individual nor of the few, but of the whole. But in the no\r\nless noble pursuits of science, literature, and art, we may in this\r\nvery generation see Filipinos achieving more than notable success\r\nand distinction, not only for themselves but for their land.\r\n\r\nPatriotic Duty.--Patriotic duty, as regards the Philippines, means\r\nfor the American a wholesome belief in the uprightness of the national\r\npurposes; a loyal appreciation of the men who have here worked wisely\r\nand without selfishness, and have borne the brunt of the toil; a\r\nloyalty to the government of the Philippines and of the United States,\r\nso long as these governments live honestly, rule justly, and increase\r\nliberty; and a frank and hearty recognition of every advance made by\r\nthe Filipino people themselves. And for the Filipinos, patriotic duty\r\nmeans a full acceptance of government as it has now been established,\r\nas better than what has preceded, and perhaps superior to what he\r\nhimself would have chosen and could have devised; a loyalty to his own\r\npeople and to their interests and to the public interests, that shall,\r\novercome the personal selfishness that has set its cruel mark on every\r\nnative institution in this land; and a resolution to obey the laws,\r\npreserve the peace, and use faithfully every opportunity for the\r\ndevelopment of his own character and the betterment of the race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nSPANISH GOVERNORS OF THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\n(1571-1898.)\r\n\r\n\r\n1571-1572 Don Miguel Lopez de Legaspi.\r\n1572-1575 (Tesorero) Guido do Labezares.\r\n1575-1580 Don Francisco La-Sande.\r\n1580-1583 Don Gonzalo Ronquillo.\r\n1583-1584 Don Diego Ronquillo.\r\n1584-1590 Dr. Don Santiago de Vera.\r\n1590-1593 Don Gomez Perez de Dasmarinas.\r\n1593-1595 Luis Perez Dasmarinas.\r\n1595-1596 Don Antonio de Morga.\r\n1596-1602 Don Francisco Tello de Guzman.\r\n1602-1606 Don Pedro Bravo de Acuna.\r\n1606-1608 Royal Audiencia.\r\n1608-1609 Don Rodrigo Vivero.\r\n1609-1616 Don Juan de Silva.\r\n1616-1618 Don Andres Alcazar.\r\n1618-1624 Don Alonso Faxardo y Tenza.\r\n1624-1625 Royal Audiencia.\r\n1625-1626 Don Fernando de Silva.\r\n1626-1632 Don Juan Nino de Tabora.\r\n1632-1633 Royal Audiencia.\r\n1633-1635 Don Juan Zerezo de Salamanca.\r\n1635-1644 Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera.\r\n1644-1653 Don Diego Faxardo y Chacon.\r\n1653-1663 Sabiano Manrique de Lara.\r\n1663-1668 Don Diego Salcedo.\r\n1668-1669 Senor Pena Bonifaz.\r\n1669-1677 Don Manuel de Leon.\r\n1677-1678 Royal Audiencia.\r\n1678-1684 Don Juan de Vargas.\r\n1684-1689 Don Gabriel de Curuzalequi.\r\n1689-1690 Don Alonso de Avila Fuertes.\r\n1690-1701 Don Fausto Cruzat y Gongora.\r\n1701-1709 Don Domingo Zabalburu.\r\n1709-1715 Conde de Lizarraga.\r\n1715-1717 Royal Audiencia.\r\n1717-1719 Don Fernando Manuel de Bustamante.\r\n1719-1721 Archbishop Cuesta.\r\n1721-1729 Don Toribio Jose de Cosio y Campo (Marques de Torre Campo).\r\n1729-1739 Don Fernando Valdes y Tamon.\r\n1739-1745 Don Gaspar de la Torre.\r\n1745-1750 Bishop Father Juan de Arrechedra.\r\n1750-1754 Don Francisco Jose de Obando y Solis.\r\n1754-1759 Don Pedro Manuel de Arandia y Santisteban.\r\n1759-1761 Don Miguel Lino de Ezpeleta (Bishop of Zebu).\r\n1761-1764 Archbishop Don Manuel Antonio Rojo del Rio y Vieyra.\r\n1764-1764 Dr. Don Simon de Anda y Salazar.\r\n1764-1765 Don Francisco de la Torre.\r\n1765-1770 Don Jose Raon.\r\n1770-1778 Dr. Don Simon de Anda y Salazar.\r\n1778-1787 Don Jose Basco y Vargas.\r\n1787-1788 Don Pedro Sarrio.\r\n1788-1793 Don Felix Berenguer de Marquina.\r\n1793-1806 Don Rafael Maria de Aguilar y Ponce de Leon.\r\n1806-1810 Don Mariano Fernandez de Folgueras.\r\n1810-1813 Don Manuel Gonzalez Aguilar.\r\n1813-1816 Don Jose de Gardoqui Jaraveitia.\r\n1816-1822 Don Mariano Fernandez de Folgueras.\r\n1822-1825 Don Juan Antonio Martinez.\r\n1825-1830 Don Mariano Ricafort Palacio y Abarca.\r\n1830-1835 Don Pascual Enrile y Alcedo.\r\n1835-1836 Don Gabriel de Torres.\r\n1836-1838 Don Andres Garcia Camba.\r\n1838-1841 Don Luis Lardizabal y Montojo.\r\n1841-1843 Don Marcelino de Oraa Lecumberri.\r\n1843-1844 Don Francisco de Paula Alcala de la Torre.\r\n1844-1850 Don Narciso Claveria y Zaldua.\r\n1850-1850 Don Antonio Maria Blanco.\r\n1850-1853 D.

This book of Ser Marco Polo has been most critically\r\nedited with introduction and voluminous notes by the English scholar,\r\nSir Henry Yule. In this edition the accounts of Marco Polo, covering\r\nso many countries and peoples of the Far East, can be studied.\r\n\r\n[3] See the noted work The Life of Prince Henry of Portugal, surnamed\r\nthe Navigator, and its Results, by Richard Henry Major, London,\r\n1868. Many of the views of Mr. Major upon the importance of Prince\r\nHenry's work and especially its early aims, have been contradicted\r\nin more recent writings. The importance of the Sagres Observatory\r\nis belittled. Doubts are expressed as to the farsightedness of\r\nPrince Henry's plans, and the best opinion of to-day holds that he\r\ndid not hope to discover a new route to India by way of Africa, but\r\nsought simply the conquest of the \"Guinea,\" which was known to the\r\nEuropeans through the Arab Geographers, who called it \"Bilad Ghana\"\r\nor \"Land of Wealth.\" The students, if possible, should read the essay\r\nof Mr. E. J. Payne, The Age of Discovery, in the Cambridge Modern\r\nHistory, Vol I.\r\n\r\n[4] The classical work on this famous ruler is Robertson's Life of\r\nCharles the Fifth, but the student should consult if possible more\r\nrecent works.\r\n\r\n[5] Primer Viaje alrededor del Mundo, Spanish translation by Amoretti,\r\nMadrid, 1899, page 27.\r\n\r\n[6] The discovery of this famous relationship is attributed to\r\nthe Spanish Jesuit Abbe, Lorenzo Hervas, whose notable Catalogo\r\nde las Lenguas de las Naciones conocidas was published in 1800-05;\r\nbut the similarity of Malay and Polynesian had been earlier shown by\r\nnaturalists who accompanied the second voyage of the famous Englishman,\r\nCaptain Cook (1772-75). The full proof, and the relation also of\r\nMalagasy, the language of Madagascar, was given in 1838 by the work\r\nof the great German philologist, Baron William von Humboldt.\r\n\r\n[7] Relacion de las Islas Filipinas, 2d ed., p. 52.\r\n\r\n[8] Another possible explanation of the many Sanskrit terms which\r\nare found in the Philippine languages, is that the period of contact\r\nbetween Filipinos and Hindus occurred not in the Philippines but in\r\nJava and Sumatra, whence the ancestors of the Filipinos came.\r\n\r\n[9] Relacion de las Islas Filipinas, 2d ed., pp. 58, 59, chap.

It treats of slave-holding, penalties for crime,\r\ninheritances, adoption, dowry, and marriage. (Las Costumbres de los\r\nTagalog en Filipinas, segun el Padre Plasencia, by T. H. Pardo de\r\nTavera.

These\r\npeople were settled at Marigondon, on the south shore of Manila Bay,\r\nwhere their descendants can still be distinguished from the surrounding\r\nTagalog population.\r\n\r\n[75] See the account of the \"Settlement of the Ladrones by the\r\nSpaniards,\" in Burney's Voyages in the Pacific, vol.
