Momentous modifications of existing\r\nrace-relations were evidently impending, and nothing could be more vital\r\nto the course of human evolution than the character of these\r\nmodifications, since upon the _quality_ of human life all else depends.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, my attention was thenceforth largely directed to racial\r\nmatters. In the preface to an historical monograph (\"The French Revolution\r\nin San Domingo\") written shortly before the Great War, I stated: \"The\r\nworld-wide struggle between the primary races of mankind--the 'conflict of\r\ncolor,' as it has been happily termed--bids fair to be the fundamental\r\nproblem of the twentieth century, and great communities like the United\r\nStates of America, the South African Confederation, and Australasia regard\r\nthe 'color question' as perhaps the gravest problem of the future.\"\r\n\r\nThose lines were penned in June, 1914. Before their publication the Great\r\nWar had burst upon the world. At that time several reviewers commented\r\nupon the above dictum and wondered whether, had I written two months\r\nlater, I should have held a different opinion.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I should have expressed myself even more strongly to\r\nthe same effect. To me the Great War was from the first the White Civil\r\nWar, which, whatever its outcome, must gravely complicate the course of\r\nracial relations.\r\n\r\nBefore the war I had hoped that the readjustments rendered inevitable by\r\nthe renascence of the brown and yellow peoples of Asia would be a gradual,\r\nand in the main a pacific, process, kept within evolutionary bounds by the\r\nwhite world's inherent strength and fundamental solidarity. The frightful\r\nweakening of the white world during the war, however, opened up\r\nrevolutionary, even cataclysmic, possibilities.\r\n\r\nIn saying this I do not refer solely to military \"perils.\" The subjugation\r\nof white lands by colored armies may, of course, occur, especially if the\r\nwhite world continues to rend itself with internecine wars. However, such\r\ncolored triumphs of arms are less to be dreaded than more enduring\r\nconquests like migrations which would swamp whole populations and turn\r\ncountries now white into colored man's lands irretrievably lost to the\r\nwhite world. Of course, these ominous possibilities existed even before\r\n1914, but the war has rendered them much more probable.\r\n\r\nThe most disquieting feature of the present situation, however, is not the\r\nwar but the peace. The white world's inability to frame a constructive\r\nsettlement, the perpetuation of intestine hatreds, and the menace of fresh\r\nwhite civil wars complicated by the spectre of social revolution, evoke\r\nthe dread thought that the late war may be merely the first stage in a\r\ncycle of ruin.\r\n\r\nIn fact, so absorbed is the white world with its domestic dissensions that\r\nit pays scant heed to racial problems whose importance for the future of\r\nmankind far transcends the questions which engross its attention to-day.\r\n\r\nThis relative indifference to the larger racial issues has determined the\r\nwriting of the present book. So fundamental are these issues that a candid\r\ndiscussion of them would seem to be timely and helpful.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I have tried to analyze in their various aspects\r\nthe present relations between the white and non-white worlds. My task has\r\nbeen greatly aided by the Introduction from the pen of Madison Grant, who\r\nhas admirably summarized the biological and historical background. A\r\nlife-long student of biology, Mr. Grant approaches the subject along that\r\nline. My own avenue of approach being world-politics, the resulting\r\nconvergence of different view-points has been a most useful one.\r\n\r\nFor the stimulating counsel of Mr. Grant in the preparation of this book\r\nmy thanks are especially due. I desire also to acknowledge my indebtedness\r\nfor helpful suggestions to Messrs. Alleyne Ireland, Glenn Frank, and other\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nLOTHROP STODDARD.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK CITY,\r\n    February 28, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                PAGE\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION BY MADISON GRANT                   xi\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I\r\n\r\n  THE RISING TIDE OF COLOR\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n     I.

A consideration of their early relations and of the\r\nhistory of the Nordic race, since its first appearance three or four\r\nthousand years ago, tends strongly to sustain and justify his conclusions.\r\nFor such a consideration we must first turn to the map, or, better, to the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nViewed in the light of geography and zoology, Europe west of Russia is but\r\na peninsula of Asia with the southern shores of the Mediterranean Sea\r\nincluded. True Africa, or rather Ethiopia, lies south of the Sahara Desert\r\nand has virtually no connection with the North except along the valley of\r\nthe Nile.\r\n\r\nThis Eurasiatic continent has been, perhaps, since the origin of life\r\nitself, the most active centre of evolution and radiation of the higher\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nConfining ourselves to the mammalian orders, we find that a majority of\r\nthem have originated and developed there and have spread thence to the\r\noutlying land areas of the globe. All the evidence points to the origin of\r\nthe Primates in Eurasia and we have every reason to believe that this\r\ncontinent was also the scene of the early evolution of man from his\r\nanthropoid ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe impulse that inaugurated the development of mankind seems to have had\r\nits basic cause in the stress of changing climatic conditions in central\r\nAsia at the close of the Pliocene, and the human inhabitants of Eurasia\r\nhave ever since exhibited in a superlative degree the energy developed at\r\nthat time. This energy, however, has not been equally shared by the\r\nvarious species of man, either extinct or living, and the survivors of the\r\nearlier races are, for the most part, to be found on the other continents\r\nand islands or in the extreme outlying regions of Eurasia itself.\r\n\r\nIn other words those groups of mankind which at an early period found\r\nrefuge in the Americas, in Australia, in Ethiopia, or in the islands of\r\nthe sea, represent to a large extent stages in man's physical and cultural\r\ndevelopment, from which the more energized inhabitants of Eurasia have\r\nlong since emerged. In some cases, as in Mexico and Peru, the outlying\r\nraces developed in their isolation a limited culture of their own, but,\r\nfor the most part, they have exhibited, and continue to this day to\r\nexhibit, a lack of capacity for sustained evolution from within as well as\r\na lack of capacity to adjust themselves of their own initiative to the\r\nrapid changes which modern times impose upon them from without.\r\n\r\nIn Eurasia itself this same inequality of potential capacity is found, but\r\nin a lesser degree, and consequently, in the progress of humanity, there\r\nhas been constant friction between those who push forward and those who\r\nare unable to keep pace with changing conditions.\r\n\r\nOwing to these causes the history of mankind has been that of a series of\r\nimpulses from the Eurasiatic continent upon the outlying regions of the\r\nglobe, but there has been an almost complete lack of reaction, either\r\nracial or cultural, from them upon the masses of mankind in Eurasia\r\nitself. There have been endless conflicts between the different sections\r\nof Eurasia, but neither Amerinds, nor Austroloids, nor Negroes, have ever\r\nmade a concerted attack upon the great continent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithout attempting a scientific classification of the inhabitants of\r\nEurasia, it is sufficient to describe the three main races. The first are\r\nthe yellow-skinned, straight black-haired, black-eyed, round-skulled\r\nMongols and Mongoloids massed in central and eastern Asia north of the\r\nHimalayan system.\r\n\r\nTo the west of them, and merged with them, lie the Alpines, also\r\ncharacterized by dark, but not straight, hair, dark eyes, relatively\r\nshort stature, and round skulls. These Alpines are thrust like a wedge\r\ninto Europe between the Nordics and the Mediterraneans, with a tip that\r\nreaches the Atlantic Ocean. Those of western Europe are derived from one\r\nor more very ancient waves of round-skulled invaders from the East, who\r\nprobably came by way of Asia Minor and the Balkans, but they have been so\r\nlong in their present homes that they retain little except their\r\nbrachycephalic skull-shape to connect them with the Asiatic Mongols.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Himalayas and westward in a narrow belt to the Atlantic, and\r\non both sides of the Inland Sea, lies the Mediterranean race, more or less\r\nswarthy-skinned, black-haired, dark-eyed, and long-skulled.\r\n\r\nOn the northwest, grouped around the Baltic and North Seas, lies the great\r\nNordic race. It is characterized by a fair white skin, wavy hair with a\r\nrange of color from dark brown to flaxen, light eyes, tall stature, and\r\nlong skulls.\r\n\r\nThese races show other physical characters which are definite but\r\ndifficult to describe, such as texture of skin and cast of features,\r\nespecially of the nose. The contrast of mental and spiritual endowments is\r\nequally definite, but even more elusive of definition.\r\n\r\nIt is with the action and interaction of these three groups, together with\r\ninternal civil wars, that recorded history deals.\r\n\r\nWhile, so far as we know, these three races have occupied their present\r\nrelative positions from the beginning, there have been profound changes\r\nin their distribution.\r\n\r\nThe two essential phenomena, however, are, first, the retreat of the\r\nNordic race westward from the Grasslands of western Asia and eastern\r\nEurope to the borders of the Atlantic, until it occupies a relatively\r\nsmall area on the periphery of Eurasia.\r\n\r\nThe second phenomenon is of equal importance, namely, the more or less\r\nthorough Nordicizing of the westernmost extensions of the other two races,\r\nnamely, the Mediterranean on the north coast of the Inland Sea, who have\r\nbeen completely Aryanized in speech, and have been again and again\r\nsaturated with Nordic blood, and the even more profound Nordicization in\r\nspeech and in blood of the short, dark, round-skulled inhabitants of\r\ncentral Europe, from Brittany through central France, southern Germany,\r\nand northern Italy into Austrian and Balkan lands. So thorough has been\r\nthis process that the western Alpines have at the present time no separate\r\nrace consciousness and are to be considered as wholly European.\r\n\r\nAs to the Alpines of eastern and central Europe, the Slavs, the case is\r\nsomewhat different. East of a line drawn from the Adriatic to the Baltic\r\nthe Nordicizing process has been far less perfect, although nearly\r\ncomplete as to speech, since all the Slavic languages are Aryan.\r\nThroughout these Slavic lands, great accessions of pure Mongoloid blood\r\nhave been introduced within relatively recent centuries.\r\n\r\nEast of this belt of imperfectly Nordicized Alpines we reach the Asiatic\r\nAlpines, as yet entirely untouched by western blood or culture. These\r\ngroups merge into the Mongoloids of eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nSo we find, thrust westward from the Heartland, a race touching the\r\nAtlantic at Brittany, thoroughly Asiatic and Mongoloid in the east, very\r\nimperfectly Nordicized in the centre, and thoroughly Nordicized culturally\r\nin the far west of Europe, where it has become, and must be accepted as,\r\nan integral part of the White World.\r\n\r\nAs to the great Nordic race, within relatively recent historic times it\r\noccupied the Grasslands north of the Black and Caspian Seas eastward to\r\nthe Himalayas. Traces of Nordic peoples in central Asia are constantly\r\nfound, and when archaeological research there becomes as intensive as in\r\nEurope we shall be astonished to find how long, complete, and extended was\r\ntheir occupation of western Asia.\r\n\r\nDuring the second millennium before our era successive waves of Nordics\r\nbegan to cross the Afghan passes into India until finally they imposed\r\ntheir primitive Aryan language upon Hindustan and the countries lying to\r\nthe east.\r\n\r\nAll those regions lying northwest of the mountains appear to have been\r\nlargely a white man's country at the time of Alexander the Great. In\r\nTurkestan the newly discovered Tokharian language, an Aryan tongue of the\r\nwestern division, seems to have persisted down to the ninth century. The\r\ndecline of the Nordics in these lands, however, began probably far\r\nearlier than Alexander's time, and must have been nearly completed at the\r\nbeginning of our era. Such blond traits as are still found in western Asia\r\nare relatively unimportant, and for the last two thousand years these\r\ncountries must be regarded as lost to the Nordic race.\r\n\r\nThe impulse that drove the early Nordics like a fan over the Himalayan\r\npasses into India, the later Nordics southward into Mesopotamian lands, as\r\nKassites, Mitanni, and Persians, into Greece and Anatolia as Achaeans,\r\nDorians, and Phrygians, westward as the Aryan-speaking invaders of Italy\r\nand as the Celtic vanguards of the Nordic race across the Rhine into Gaul,\r\nSpain, and Britain, may well have been caused by Mongoloid pressure from\r\nthe heart of central Asia. Of course, we have no actual knowledge of this,\r\nbut the analogy to the history of later migrations is strong, and the\r\nconviction is growing among historians that the impulse that drove the\r\nHellenic Nordics upon the early AEgean culture world was the same as that\r\nwhich later drove Germanic Nordics into the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Caspian and Black Seas the boundaries of Europe receded\r\nsteadily before Asia for nearly a thousand years after our era opened, but\r\nwe have scant record of the struggles which resulted in the eviction of\r\nthe Nordics from their homes in Russia, Poland, the Austrian and east\r\nGerman lands.\r\n\r\nBy the time of Charlemagne the White Man's world was reduced to\r\nScandinavia, Germany west of the Elbe, the British Isles, the Low\r\nCountries, and northern France and Italy, with outlying groups in southern\r\nFrance and Spain. This was the lowest ebb for the Nordics and it was the\r\ncrowning glory of Charlemagne's career that he not only turned back the\r\nflood, but began the organization of a series of more or less Nordicized\r\nmarches or barrier states from the Baltic to the Adriatic, which have\r\nserved as ramparts against Asiatic pressure from his day to ours. West of\r\nthis line the feudal states of mediaeval Europe developed into western\r\nChristendom, the nucleus of the civilized world of to-day.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Caspian and Black Seas, after the first swarming of the\r\nNordics over the mountains during the second millennium before Christ, the\r\nEast pressed steadily against Europe until the strain culminated in the\r\nPersian Wars. The defeat of Asia in these wars resulted later in\r\nAlexander's conquest of western Asia to the borders of India.\r\n\r\nAlexander's empire temporarily established Hellenic institutions\r\nthroughout western Asia and some of the provinces remained superficially\r\nGreek until they were incorporated in the Roman Empire and ultimately\r\nbecame part of early Christendom. On the whole, however, from the time of\r\nAlexander the elimination of European blood, classic culture, and,\r\nfinally, of Christianity, went on relentlessly.\r\n\r\nBy later Roman times the Aryan language of the Persians, Parthians, and\r\npeople of India together with some shreds of Greek learning were about all\r\nthe traces of Europe that were to be found east of the oscillating\r\nboundary along the Euphrates.\r\n\r\nThe Roman and Byzantine Empires struggled for centuries to check the\r\nadvancing tide of Asiatics, but Arab expansions under the impulse of the\r\nMohammedan religion finally tore away all the eastern and southern coasts\r\nof the Mediterranean Sea, while from an Arabized Spain they threatened\r\nwestern Europe. With the White Man's world thus rapidly receding in the\r\nsouth, a series of pure Mongol invasions from central Asia, sweeping north\r\nof the Caspian and Black Seas, burst upon central Europe. Attila and his\r\nHuns were the first to break through into Nordic lands as far as the\r\nplains of northern France. None of the later hordes were able to force\r\ntheir way so far into Nordic territories, but spent their strength upon\r\nthe Alpines of the Balkans and eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nEastern Germany, the Austrian states, Poland, and Russia had been Nordic\r\nlands before the Slavs emerged after the fall of Rome. Whether the\r\noccupation of Teutonic lands by the Wends and Slavs in eastern Europe was\r\nan infiltration or a conquest is not known, but the conviction is growing\r\nthat, like other movements which preceded and followed, it was caused by\r\nMongoloid pressure.\r\n\r\nThat the western Slavs or Wends had been long Nordicized in speech is\r\nindicated by the thoroughly Aryan character of the Slavic languages. They\r\nfound in the lands they occupied an underlying Teutonic population. They\r\ncannot be regarded as the original owners of Poland, Bohemia, Silesia, or\r\nother Wendish provinces of eastern Germany and Austria. The Teutonic\r\nMarcomanni and Quadi were in Bohemia long before the Czechs came in\r\nthrough the Moravian Gate in the sixth century. Pomerania and the Prussias\r\nwere the home of Teutonic Lombards, Burgunds, Vandals, and Suevi, while\r\nthe Crimea and the northwestern coast of the Black Sea were long held by\r\nthe Nordic Goths, who, just before our era, had migrated overland from the\r\nBaltic by way of the Vistula.\r\n\r\nNo doubt some of this Nordic blood remained to ennoble the stock of the\r\nlater invaders, but by the time of Charlemagne, in the greater part of\r\nEurope east of the Elbe, the Aryan language was the only bond with Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen the Frankish Empire turned the tide and Christianized these Wendish\r\nand Polish lands, civilization was carried eastward until it met the\r\nByzantine influences which brought to Russia and the lands east of the\r\nCarpathians the culture and Orthodox Christianity of the Eastern or Greek\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of Russia was organized in the ninth century by Scandinavian\r\nVarangians, the Franks of the East, who founded the first civilized state\r\namid a welter of semi-Mongoloid tribes. How much Nordic blood they found\r\nin the territories which afterward became Russia we have no means of\r\nknowing, but it must have been considerable because we do know that from\r\nthe Middle Ages to the present time there has been a progressive increase\r\nin brachycephaly or broad-headedness, to judge from the rise in the\r\npercentage of round skulls found in the cemeteries of Moscow and elsewhere\r\nin Russia.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of eastern Europe when a new and terrible series of\r\nMongoloid invasions swept over it, this time directly from the centre of\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these invasions was so profound and lasting that it may be\r\nwell to consider briefly the condition of eastern Europe after the\r\nelimination of the Nordics and its partial occupation by the so-called\r\nSlavs. Beginning with Attila and his Huns, in the fourth century, there\r\nwas a series of purely Mongoloid tribes entering from Asia in wave after\r\nwave.\r\n\r\nSimilar waves ultimately passed south of the Black and Caspian Seas, and\r\nwere called Turks, but these were long held back by the power of the\r\nByzantine Empire, to which history has done scant justice.\r\n\r\nIn the north these invaders, called in the later days Tatars, but all\r\nessentially of central Asiatic Mongol stock, occupied Balkan lands after\r\nthe expansion of the south Slavs in those countries. They are known by\r\nvarious names, but they are all part of the same general movement,\r\nalthough there was a gradual slowing down of the impulse. Prior to Jenghiz\r\nKhan the later hordes did not reach quite as far west as the earlier ones.\r\n\r\nThe first wave, Attila's Huns, were followed during the succeeding\r\ncenturies by the Avars, the Bulgars, the Hunagar Magyars, the Patzinaks\r\nand the Cumans. All of these tribes forced their way over the Carpathians\r\nand the Danube, and much of their blood, notably in that of the Bulgars\r\nand Magyars, is still to be found there. Most of them adopted Slavic\r\ndialects and merged in the surrounding population, but the Magyars retain\r\ntheir Asiatic speech to this day.\r\n\r\nOther Tatar and Mongoloid tribes settled in southern and eastern Russia.\r\nChief among these were the Mongol Chazars, who founded an extensive and\r\npowerful empire in southern and southeastern Russia as early as the eighth\r\ncentury. It is interesting to note that they accepted Judaism and became\r\nthe ancestors of the majority of the Jews of eastern Europe, the\r\nround-skulled Ashkenazim.\r\n\r\nInto this mixed population of Christianized Slavs and more or less\r\nChristianized and Slavized Mongols burst Jenghiz Khan with his great\r\nhordes of pure Mongols. All southern Russia, Poland, and Hungary collapsed\r\nbefore them, and in southern Russia the rule of the Mongol persisted for\r\ncenturies, in fact the Golden Horde of Tatars retained control of the\r\nCrimea down to 1783.\r\n\r\nMany of these later Tatars had accepted Islam, but entire groups of them\r\nhave retained their Asiatic speech and to this day profess the Mohammedan\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe most lasting result of these Mongol invasions was that southern Poland\r\nand all the countries east and north of the Carpathians, including Rumania\r\nand the Ukraine, were saturated anew with Tatar blood, and, in dealing\r\nwith these populations and with the new nations founded among them, this\r\nfact must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between the East and the West--Europe and Asia--has thus\r\nlasted for centuries, in fact it goes back to the Persian Wars and the\r\nlong and doubtful duel between Rome and Parthia along the eastern boundary\r\nof Syria. As we have already said, the Saracens had torn away many of the\r\nprovinces of the Eastern Empire, and the Crusades, for a moment, had\r\nrolled back the East, but the event was not decided until the Seljukian\r\nand Osmanli Turks accepted Islam.\r\n\r\nIf these Turks had remained heathen they might have invaded and conquered\r\nAsia Minor and the Balkan States, just as their cousins, the Tartars, had\r\nsubjected vast territories north of the Black Sea, but they could not have\r\nheld their conquests permanently unless they had been able to incorporate\r\nthe beaten natives into their own ranks through the proselytizing power of\r\nIslam.\r\n\r\nEven in Roman times the Greek world had been steadily losing, first its\r\nNordic blood and then later the blood of its Nordicized European\r\npopulation, and it became in its declining years increasingly Asiatic\r\nuntil the final fall of Constantinople in 1453.\r\n\r\nByzantium once fallen, the Turks advanced unchecked, conquering the Alpine\r\nSlav kingdoms of the Balkans and menacing Christendom itself.\r\n\r\nIn these age-long conflicts between Asia and Europe the Crusades seem but\r\nan episode, although tragically wasteful of Nordic stock. The Nordic\r\nFrankish nobility of western Europe squandered its blood for two hundred\r\nyears on the desert sands of Syria and left no ethnic trace behind, save,\r\nperhaps, some doubtful blond remnants in northern Syria and Edessa.\r\n\r\nIf the predictions of Mr. Stoddard's book seem far-fetched, one has but to\r\nconsider that four times since the fall of Rome Asia has conquered to the\r\nvery confines of Nordic Europe. The Nordicized Alpines of eastern Europe\r\nand the Nordicized Mediterraneans of southern Europe have proved too\r\nfeeble to hold back the Asiatic hordes, Mongol or Saracen. It was not\r\nuntil the realms of pure Nordics were reached that the invaders were\r\nturned back. This is shown by the fact that the Arabs had quickly mastered\r\nnorthern Africa and conquered Spain, where the Nordic Goths were too few\r\nin number to hold them back, while southern France, which was not then,\r\nand is not now, a Nordic land, had offered no serious resistance. It was\r\nnot until the Arabs, in 732, at Tours, dashed themselves to pieces against\r\nthe solid ranks of heavy-armed Nordics, that Islam receded.\r\n\r\nThe same fate had already been encountered by Attila and his Huns, who,\r\nafter dominating Hungary and southern Germany and destroying the\r\nBurgundians on the Rhine, had pushed into northern France as far as\r\nChalons. Here, in 376, he was beaten, not by the Romanized Gauls but by\r\nthe Nordic Visigoths, whose king, Roderick, died on the field. These two\r\nvictories, one against the Arab south and the other over the Mongoloid\r\neast, saved Nordic Europe, which was at that time shrunken to little more\r\nthan a fringe on the seacoast.\r\n\r\nHow slender the thread and how easily snapped, had the event of either day\r\nturned out otherwise! Never again did Asia push so far west, but the\r\ndanger was not finally removed until Charlemagne and his successors had\r\norganized the Western Empire.\r\n\r\nChristendom, however, had sore trials ahead when the successors of Jenghiz\r\nKhan destroyed Moscovy and Poland and devastated eastern Europe. The\r\nvictorious career of the Tatars was unchecked, from the Chinese Sea on the\r\neast to the Indian Ocean on the south, until in 1241, at Wahlstatt in\r\nSilesia, they encountered pure Nordic fighting men. Then the tide turned.\r\nThough outnumbering the Christians five to one and victorious in the\r\nbattle itself, the Tatars were unable to push farther west and turned\r\nsouth into Hungary and other Alpine lands.\r\n\r\nSome conception of the almost unbelievable horrors that western Europe\r\nescaped at this time may be gathered from the fate of the countries which\r\nfell before the irresistible rush of the Mongols, whose sole discernible\r\nmotive seems to have been blood lust. The destruction wrought in China,\r\ncentral Asia, and Persia is almost beyond conception. In twelve years, in\r\nChina and the neighboring states, Jenghiz Khan and his lieutenants\r\nslaughtered more than 18,500,000 human beings. After the sack of Merv in\r\nKhorasan, the \"Garden of Asia,\" the corpses numbered 1,300,000, and after\r\nHerat was taken 1,600,000 are said to have perished. Similar fates befell\r\nevery city of importance in central Asia, and to this day those once\r\npopulous provinces have never recovered. The cities of Russia and Poland\r\nwere burned, their inhabitants tortured and massacred, with the\r\nconsequence that progress was retarded for centuries.\r\n\r\nAlmost in modern times these same Mongoloid invaders, entering by way of\r\nAsia Minor, and calling themselves Turks, after destroying the Eastern\r\nEmpire, the Balkan States, and Hungary, again met the Nordic chivalry of\r\nwestern Europe under the walls of Vienna, in 1683, and again the Asiatics\r\nwent down in rout.\r\n\r\nOn these four separate occasions the Nordic race and it alone saved modern\r\ncivilization. The half-Nordicized lands to the south and to the east\r\ncollapsed under the invasions.\r\n\r\nUnnumbered Nordic tribes, nameless and unsung, have been massacred, or\r\nsubmerged, or driven from their lands. The survivors had been pushed ever\r\nwestward until their backs were against the Northern Ocean. There the\r\nNordics came to bay--the tide was turned. Few stop to reflect that it was\r\nmore than sixty years after the first American legislature sat at\r\nJamestown, Virginia, that Asia finally abandoned the conquest of Europe.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief results of forcing the Nordic race back to the seacoast\r\nwas the creation of maritime power and its development to a degree never\r\nbefore known even in the days of the Phoenicians and Carthaginians.\r\nWith the recession of the Turkish flood, modern Europe emerges and\r\ninaugurates a counter-attack on Asia which has placed virtually the entire\r\nworld under European domination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile in the mediaeval conflicts between Europe and Asia the latter was the\r\naggressor, the case was otherwise in the early wars between the Nordic and\r\nthe Mediterranean peoples. Here for three thousand years the Nordics were\r\nthe aggressors, and, although these wars were terribly destructive to\r\ntheir numbers, they were the medium through which classic civilization was\r\nintroduced into Nordic lands. As to the ethnic consequences, northern\r\nbarbarians poured over the passes of the Balkans, Alpines, and Pyrenees\r\ninto the sunny lands of the south only to slowly vanish in the languid\r\nenvironment which lacked the stimulus of fierce strife with hostile nature\r\nand savage rivals.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, long before the opening of the Christian era the Alpines of\r\nwestern Europe were thoroughly Nordicized, and in the centuries that\r\nfollowed, the old Nordic element in Spain, Italy, and France has been\r\nagain and again strongly reinforced, so that these lands are now an\r\nintegral part of the White World.\r\n\r\nIn recent centuries Russia was again superficially Nordicized with a top\r\ndressing of Nordic nobility, chiefly coming from the Baltic provinces.\r\nAlong with this process there was everywhere in Europe a resurgence among\r\nthe submerged and forgotten Alpines and among the Mediterranean elements\r\nof the British Isles, while Bolshevism in Russia means the elimination of\r\nthe Nordic aristocracy and the dominance of the half-Asiatic Slavic\r\npeasantry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll wars thus far discussed have been race wars of Europe against Asia, or\r\nof the Nordics against Mediterraneans. The wars against the Mongols were\r\nnecessary and vital; there was no alternative except to fight to the\r\nfinish. But the wars of northern Europe against the south, from the racial\r\npoint of view, were not only useless but destructive. Bad as they were,\r\nhowever, they left untouched to a large extent the broodland of the race\r\nin the north and west.\r\n\r\nAnother class of wars, however, has been absolutely deadly to the Nordic\r\nrace. There must have been countless early struggles where one Nordic\r\ntribe attacked and exterminated its rival, such as the Trojan War, fought\r\nbetween Achaeans and Phrygians, both Nordics, while the later Peloponnesian\r\nWar was a purely civil strife between Greeks and resulted in the racial\r\ncollapse of Hellas.\r\n\r\nRome, after she emerged triumphant from her struggle with the\r\nCarthaginians, of Mediterranean race, plunged into a series of civil wars\r\nwhich ended in the complete elimination of the native Nordic element in\r\nRome. Her conquests also were destructive to the Nordic race; particularly\r\nso was that of Caesar in Gaul, one of the few exceptional cases where the\r\nnorth was permanently conquered by the south. The losses of that ten-year\r\nconquest fell far more heavily upon the Nordic Celts in Gaul and Britain\r\nthan on the servile strata of the population.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the Saxon conquest of England destroyed the Nordic\r\nBrythons to a greater degree than the pre-Nordic Neolithic Mediterranean\r\nelement. From that time on all the wars of Europe, other than those\r\nagainst the Asiatics and Saracens, were essentially civil wars fought\r\nbetween peoples or leaders of Nordic blood.\r\n\r\nMediaeval Europe was one long welter of Nordic immolation until the Wars of\r\nthe Roses in England, the Hundred Years' War in the Lowlands, the\r\nreligious, revolutionary, and Napoleonic wars in France, and the ghastly\r\nThirty Years' War in Germany dangerously depleted the ruling Nordic race\r\nand paved the way for the emergence from obscurity of the servile races\r\nwhich for ages had been dominated by them.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the present war has fostered this tendency, time alone will\r\nshow, but Mr. Stoddard has pointed out some of the immediate and visible\r\nresults. The backbone of western civilization is racially Nordic, the\r\nAlpines and Mediterraneans being effective precisely to the extent in\r\nwhich they have been Nordicized and vitalized.\r\n\r\nIf this great race, with its capacity for leadership and fighting, should\r\nultimately pass, with it would pass that which we call civilization. It\r\nwould be succeeded by an unstable and bastardized population, where worth\r\nand merit would have no inherent right to leadership and among which a\r\nnew and darker age would blot out our racial inheritance.\r\n\r\nSuch a catastrophe cannot threaten if the Nordic race will gather itself\r\ntogether in time, shake off the shackles of an inveterate altruism,\r\ndiscard the vain phantom of internationalism, and reassert the pride of\r\nrace and the right of merit to rule.\r\n\r\nThe Nordic race has been driven from many of its lands, but still grasps\r\nfirmly the control of the world, and it is certainly not at a greater\r\nnumerical disadvantage than often before in contrast to the teeming\r\npopulation of eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nIt has repeatedly been confronted with crises where the accident of\r\nbattle, or the genius of a leader, saved a well-nigh hopeless day. It has\r\nsurvived defeat, it has survived the greater danger of victory, and, if it\r\ntakes warning in time, it may face the future with assurance. Fight it\r\nmust, but let that fight be not a civil war against its own blood kindred\r\nbut against the dangerous foreign races, whether they advance sword in\r\nhand or in the more insidious guise of beggars at our gates, pleading for\r\nadmittance to share our prosperity. If we continue to allow them to enter\r\nthey will in time drive us out of our own land by mere force of breeding.\r\n\r\nThe great hope of the future here in America lies in the realization of\r\nthe working class that competition of the Nordic with the alien is fatal,\r\nwhether the latter be the lowly immigrant from southern or eastern Europe\r\nor whether he be the more obviously dangerous Oriental against whose\r\nstandards of living the white man cannot compete. In this country we must\r\nlook to such of our people--our farmers and artisans--as are still of\r\nAmerican blood to recognize and meet this danger.\r\n\r\nOur present condition is the result of following the leadership of\r\nidealists and philanthropic doctrinaires, aided and abetted by the\r\nperfectly understandable demand of our captains of industry for cheap\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nTo-day the need for statesmanship is great, and greater still is the need\r\nfor thorough knowledge of history. All over the world the first has been\r\nlacking, and in the passions of the Great War the lessons of the past have\r\nbeen forgotten both here and in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a chain of Alpine states from the Baltic to the\r\nAdriatic, as a sequel to the war, all of them organized at the expense of\r\nthe Nordic ruling classes, may bring Europe back to the days when\r\nCharlemagne, marching from the Rhine to the Elbe, found the valley of that\r\nriver inhabited by heathen Wends. Beyond lay Asia, and his successors\r\nspent a thousand years pushing eastward the frontiers of Europe.\r\n\r\nNow that Asia, in the guise of Bolshevism with Semitic leadership and\r\nChinese executioners, is organizing an assault upon western Europe, the\r\nnew states--Slavic-Alpine in race, with little Nordic blood--may prove to\r\nbe not frontier guards of western Europe but vanguards of Asia in central\r\nEurope. None of the earlier Alpine states have held firm against Asia, and\r\nit is more than doubtful whether Poland, Bohemia, Rumania, Hungary, and\r\nJugo-Slavia can face the danger successfully, now that they have been\r\ndeprived of the Nordic ruling classes through democratic institutions.\r\n\r\nDemocratic ideals among an homogeneous population of Nordic blood, as in\r\nEngland or America, is one thing, but it is quite another for the white\r\nman to share his blood with, or intrust his ideals to, brown, yellow,\r\nblack, or red men.\r\n\r\nThis is suicide pure and simple, and the first victim of this amazing\r\nfolly will be the white man himself.\r\n\r\nMADISON GRANT.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, March 1, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART I_\r\n\r\nTHE RISING TIDE OF COLOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD OF COLOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who, on a quiet spring evening of the year 1914, opened his atlas\r\nto a political map of the world and pored over its many-tinted patterns\r\nprobably got one fundamental impression: the overwhelming preponderance of\r\nthe white race in the ordering of the world's affairs. Judged by accepted\r\ncanons of statecraft, the white man towered the indisputable master of the\r\nplanet. Forth from Europe's teeming mother-hive the imperious Sons of\r\nJaphet had swarmed for centuries to plant their laws, their customs, and\r\ntheir battle-flags at the uttermost ends of the earth. Two whole\r\ncontinents, North America and Australia, had been made virtually as white\r\nin blood as the European motherland; two other continents, South America\r\nand Africa, had been extensively colonized by white stocks; while even\r\nhuge Asia had seen its empty northern march, Siberia, pre-empted for the\r\nwhite man's abode. Even where white populations had not locked themselves\r\nto the soil few regions of the earth had escaped the white man's imperial\r\nsway, and vast areas inhabited by uncounted myriads of dusky folk obeyed\r\nthe white man's will.\r\n\r\nBeside the enormous area of white settlement or control, the regions under\r\nnon-white governance bulked small indeed. In eastern Asia, China, Japan,\r\nand Siam; in western Asia, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Persia; in Africa,\r\nAbyssinia, and Liberia; and in America the minute state of Haiti: such was\r\nthe brief list of lands under non-white rule. In other words, of the\r\n53,000,000 square miles which (excluding the polar regions) constitute the\r\nland area of the globe, only 6,000,000 square miles had non-white\r\ngovernments, and nearly two-thirds of this relatively modest remainder was\r\nrepresented by China and its dependencies.\r\n\r\nSince 1914 the world has been convulsed by the most terrible war in\r\nrecorded history. This war was primarily a struggle between the white\r\npeoples, who have borne the brunt of the conflict and have suffered most\r\nof the losses. Nevertheless, one of the war's results has been a further\r\nwhittling down of the areas standing outside white political control.\r\nTurkey is to-day practically an Anglo-French condominium, Persia is\r\nvirtually a protectorate of the British Empire, while the United States\r\nhas thrown over the endemic anarchy of Haiti the aegis of the _Pax\r\nAmericana_. Study of the political map might thus apparently lead one to\r\nconclude that white world-predominance is immutable, since the war's\r\nordeal has still further broadened the territorial basis of its authority.\r\n\r\nAt this point the reader is perhaps asking himself why this book was ever\r\nundertaken. The answer is: the dangerous delusion created by viewing world\r\naffairs solely from the angle of politics. The late war has taught many\r\nlessons as to the unstable and transitory character of even the most\r\nimposing political phenomena, while a better reading of history must bring\r\nhome the truth that the basic factor in human affairs is not politics, but\r\nrace. The reader has already encountered this fundamental truth on every\r\npage of the Introduction. He will remember, for instance, how west-central\r\nAsia, which in the dawn of history was predominantly white man's country,\r\nis to-day racially brown man's land in which white blood survives only as\r\nvestigial traces of vanishing significance. If this portion of Asia, the\r\nformer seat of mighty white empires and possibly the very homeland of the\r\nwhite race itself, should have so entirely changed its ethnic character,\r\nwhat assurance can the most impressive political panorama give us that the\r\npresent world-order may not swiftly and utterly pass away?\r\n\r\nThe force of this query is exemplified when we turn from the political to\r\nthe racial map of the globe. What a transformation! Instead of a world\r\npolitically nine-tenths white, we see a world of which only four-tenths at\r\nthe most can be considered predominantly white in blood, the rest of the\r\nworld being inhabited mainly by the other primary races of\r\nmankind--yellows, browns, blacks, and reds. Speaking by continents,\r\nEurope, North America to the Rio Grande, the southern portion of South\r\nAmerica, the Siberian part of Asia, and Australasia constitute the real\r\nwhite world; while the bulk of Asia, virtually the whole of Africa, and\r\nmost of Central and South America form the world of color. The respective\r\nareas of these two racially contrasted worlds are 22,000,000 square miles\r\nfor the whites and 31,000,000 square miles for the colored races.\r\nFurthermore it must be remembered that fully one-third of the white area\r\n(notably Australasia and Siberia) is very thinly inhabited and is thus\r\nheld by a very slender racial tenure--the only tenure which counts in the\r\nlong run.\r\n\r\nThe statistical disproportion between the white and colored worlds becomes\r\nstill more marked when we turn from surveys of area to tables of\r\npopulation. The total number of human beings alive to-day is about\r\n1,700,000,000. Of these 550,000,000 are white, while 1,150,000,000 are\r\ncolored. The colored races thus outnumber the whites more than two to one.\r\nAnother fact of capital importance is that the great bulk of the white\r\nrace is concentrated in the European continent. In 1914 the population of\r\nEurope was approximately 450,000,000. The late war has undoubtedly caused\r\nan absolute decrease of many millions of souls. Nevertheless, the basic\r\nfact remains that some four-fifths of the entire white race is\r\nconcentrated on less than one-fifth of the white world's territorial area\r\n(Europe), while the remaining one-fifth of the race (some 110,000,000\r\nsouls), scattered to the ends of the earth, must protect four-fifths of\r\nthe white territorial heritage against the pressure of colored races\r\neleven times its numerical strength.\r\n\r\nAs to the 1,150,000,000 of the colored world, they are divided, as already\r\nstated, into four primary categories: yellows, browns, blacks, and reds.\r\nThe yellows are the most numerous of the colored races, numbering over\r\n500,000,000. Their habitat is eastern Asia. Nearly as numerous and much\r\nmore wide-spread than the yellows are the browns, numbering some\r\n450,000,000. The browns spread in a broad belt from the Pacific Ocean\r\nwestward across southern Asia and northern Africa to the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nThe blacks total about 150,000,000. Their centre is Africa south of the\r\nSahara Desert, but besides the African continent there are vestigial black\r\ntraces across southern Asia to the Pacific and also strong black outposts\r\nin the Americas. Least numerous of the colored race-stocks are the\r\nreds--the \"Indians\" of the western hemisphere. Mustering a total of less\r\nthan 40,000,000, the reds are almost all located south of the Rio Grande\r\nin \"Latin America.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the ethnic make-up of that world of color which, as already seen,\r\noutnumbers the white world two to one. That is a formidable ratio, and its\r\nsignificance is heightened by the fact that this ratio seems destined to\r\nshift still further in favor of color. There can be no doubt that at\r\npresent the colored races are increasing very much faster than the white.\r\nTreating the primary race-stocks as units, it would appear that whites\r\ntend to double in eighty years, yellows and browns in sixty years, blacks\r\nin forty years. The whites are thus the slowest breeders, and they will\r\nundoubtedly become slower still, since section after section of the white\r\nrace is revealing that lowered birth-rate which in France has reached the\r\nextreme of a stationary population.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, none of the colored races shows perceptible signs of\r\ndeclining birth-rate, all tending to breed up to the limits of available\r\nsubsistence. Such checks as now limit the increase of colored populations\r\nare wholly external, like famine, disease, and tribal warfare. But by a\r\ncurious irony of fate, the white man has long been busy removing these\r\nchecks to colored multiplication. The greater part of the colored world is\r\nto-day under white political control. Wherever the white man goes he\r\nattempts to impose the bases of his ordered civilization. He puts down\r\ntribal war, he wages truceless combat against epidemic disease, and he so\r\nimproves communications that augmented and better distributed\r\nfood-supplies minimize the blight of famine. In response to these\r\nlife-saving activities the enormous death-rate which in the past has kept\r\nthe colored races from excessive multiplication is falling to proportions\r\ncomparable with the death-rate of white countries. But to lower the\r\ncolored world's prodigious birth-rate is quite another matter. The\r\nconsequence is a portentous increase of population in nearly every portion\r\nof the colored world now under white political sway. In fact, even those\r\ncolored countries which have maintained their independence, such as China\r\nand Japan, are adopting the white man's life-conserving methods and are\r\nexperiencing the same accelerated increase of population.\r\n\r\nNow what must be the inevitable result of all this? It can mean only one\r\nthing: a tremendous and steadily augmenting outward thrust of surplus\r\ncolored men from overcrowded colored homelands. Remember that these\r\nhomelands are already populated up to the available limits of subsistence.\r\nOf course present limits can in many cases be pushed back by better living\r\nconditions, improved agriculture, and the rise of modern machine industry\r\nsuch as is already under way in Japan. Nevertheless, in view of the\r\ntremendous population increases which must occur, these can be only\r\npalliatives. Where, then, should the congested colored world tend to pour\r\nits accumulating human surplus, inexorably condemned to emigrate or\r\nstarve? The answer is: into those emptier regions of the earth under white\r\npolitical control. But many of these relatively empty lands have been\r\ndefinitely set aside by the white man as his own special heritage. The\r\nupshot is that the rising flood of color finds itself walled in by white\r\ndikes debarring it from many a promised land which it would fain deluge\r\nwith its dusky waves.\r\n\r\nThus the colored world, long restive under white political domination, is\r\nbeing welded by the most fundamental of instincts, the instinct of\r\nself-preservation, into a common solidarity of feeling against the\r\ndominant white man, and in the fire of a common purpose internecine\r\ndifferences tend, for the time at least, to be burned away. Before the\r\nsupreme fact of white political world-domination, antipathies within the\r\ncolored world must inevitably recede into the background.\r\n\r\nThe imperious urge of the colored world toward racial expansion was well\r\nvisualized by that keen English student of world affairs, Doctor E. J.\r\nDillon, when he wrote more than a decade ago: \"The problem is one of life\r\nand death--a veritable sphinx-question--to those most nearly concerned.\r\nFor, no race, however inferior it may be, will consent to famish slowly in\r\norder that other people may fatten and take their ease, especially if it\r\nhas a good chance to make a fight for life.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThis white statement of the colored thesis is an accurate reflection of\r\nwhat colored men say themselves. For example, a Japanese scholar,\r\nProfessor Ryutaro Nagai, writes: \"The world was not made for the white\r\nraces, but for the other races as well. In Australia, South Africa,\r\nCanada, and the United States, there are vast tracts of unoccupied\r\nterritory awaiting settlement, and although the citizens of the ruling\r\nPowers refuse to take up the land, no yellow people are permitted to\r\nenter. Thus the white races seem ready to commit to the savage birds and\r\nbeasts what they refuse to intrust to their brethren of the yellow race.\r\nSurely the arrogance and avarice of the nobility in apportioning to\r\nthemselves the most and the best of the land in certain countries is as\r\nnothing compared with the attitude of the white races toward those of a\r\ndifferent hue.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe bitter resentment of white predominance and exclusiveness awakened in\r\nmany colored breasts is typified by the following lines penned by a brown\r\nman, a British-educated Afghan, shortly before the European War.\r\nInveighing against our \"racial prejudice, that cowardly, wretched\r\ncaste-mark of the European and the American the world over,\" he exultantly\r\npredicts \"a coming struggle between Asia, all Asia, against Europe and\r\nAmerica. You are heaping up material for a Jehad, a Pan-Islam, a Pan-Asia\r\nHoly War, a gigantic day of reckoning, an invasion of a new Attila and\r\nTamerlane--who will use rifles and bullets, instead of lances and spears.\r\nYou are deaf to the voice of reason and fairness, and so you must be\r\ntaught with the whirring swish of the sword when it is red.\"[3]\r\n\r\nOf course in these statements there is nothing either exceptional or\r\nnovel. The colored races never welcomed white predominance and were always\r\nrestive under white control. Down to the close of the nineteenth century,\r\nhowever, they generally accepted white hegemony as a disagreeable but\r\ninevitable fact. For four hundred years the white man had added continent\r\nto continent in his imperial progress, equipped with resistless sea-power\r\nand armed with a mechanical superiority that crushed down all local\r\nefforts at resistance. In time, therefore, the colored races accorded to\r\nwhite supremacy a fatalistic acquiescence, and, though never loved, the\r\nwhite man was usually respected and universally feared.\r\n\r\nDuring the closing decades of the nineteenth century, to be sure,\r\npremonitory signs of a change in attitude began to appear. The yellow and\r\nbrown races, at least, stirred by the very impact of Western ideas,\r\nmeasured the white man with a more critical eye and commenced to wonder\r\nwhether his superiority was due to anything more than a fortuitous\r\ncombination of circumstances which might be altered by efforts of their\r\nown. Japan put this theory to the test by going sedulously to the white\r\nman's school. The upshot was the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, an event the\r\nmomentous character of which is even now not fully appreciated. Of course,\r\nthat war was merely the sign-manual of a whole nexus of forces making for\r\na revivified Asia. But it dramatized and clarified ideas which had been\r\ngerminating half-unconsciously in millions of colored minds, and both Asia\r\nand Africa thrilled with joy and hope. Above all, the legend of white\r\ninvincibility lay, a fallen idol, in the dust. Nevertheless, though freed\r\nfrom imaginary terrors, the colored world accurately gauged the white\r\nman's practical strength and appreciated the magnitude of the task\r\ninvolved in overthrowing white supremacy. That supremacy was no longer\r\nacquiesced in as inevitable and hopes of ultimate success were confidently\r\nentertained, but the process was usually conceived as a slow and difficult\r\none. Fear of white power and respect for white civilization thus remained\r\npotent restraining factors.\r\n\r\nThen came the Great War. The colored world suddenly saw the white peoples\r\nwhich, in racial matters had hitherto maintained something of a united\r\nfront, locked in an internecine death-grapple of unparalleled ferocity; it\r\nsaw those same peoples put one another furiously to the ban as\r\nirreconcilable foes; it saw white race-unity cleft by political and moral\r\ngulfs which white men themselves continuously iterated would never be\r\nfilled. As colored men realized the significance of it all, they looked\r\ninto each other's eyes and there saw the light of undreamed-of hopes. The\r\nwhite world was tearing itself to pieces. White solidarity was riven and\r\nshattered. And--fear of white power and respect for white civilization\r\ntogether dropped away like garments outworn. Through the bazaars of Asia\r\nran the sibilant whisper: \"The East will see the West to bed!\"\r\n\r\nThe chorus of mingled exultation, hate, and scorn sounded from every\r\nportion of the colored world. Chinese scholars, Japanese professors, Hindu\r\npundits, Turkish journalists, and Afro-American editors, one and all\r\nvoiced drastic criticisms of white civilization and hailed the war as a\r\nwell-merited Nemesis on white arrogance and greed. This is how the\r\nConstantinople _Tanine_, the most serious Turkish newspaper, characterized\r\nthe European Powers: \"They would not look at the evils in their own\r\ncountries or elsewhere, but interfered at the slightest incident in our\r\nborders; every day they would gnaw at some part of our rights and our\r\nsovereignty; they would perform vivisection on our quivering flesh and cut\r\noff great pieces of it. And we, with a forcibly controlled spirit of\r\nrebellion in our hearts and with clinched but powerless fists, silent and\r\ndepressed, would murmur as the fire burned within: 'Oh, that they might\r\nfall out with one another! Oh, that they might eat one another up!' And\r\nlo! to-day they are eating each other up, just as the Turk wished they\r\nwould.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe Afro-American author, W. E. Burghardt Dubois, wrote of the colored\r\nworld: \"These nations and races, composing as they do a vast majority of\r\nhumanity, are going to endure this treatment just as long as they must and\r\nnot a moment longer. Then they are going to fight, and the War of the\r\nColor Line will outdo in savage inhumanity any war this world has yet\r\nseen. For colored folk have much to remember and they will not forget.\"[5]\r\n\r\n\"What does the European War mean to us Orientals?\" queried the Japanese\r\nwriter, Yone Noguchi. \"It means the saddest downfall of the so-called\r\nwestern civilization; our belief that it was builded upon a higher and\r\nsounder footing than ours was at once knocked down and killed; we are\r\nsorry that we somehow overestimated its happy possibility and were\r\ndeceived and cheated by its superficial glory. My recent western journey\r\nconfirmed me that the so-called dynamic western civilization was all\r\nagainst the Asiatic belief. And when one does not respect the others,\r\nthere will be only one thing to come, that is, fight, in action or\r\nsilence.\"[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRIMARY RACES]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the colored world's reaction to the white death-grapple, and as\r\nthe long struggle dragged on both Asia and Africa stirred to their very\r\ndepths. To be sure, no great explosions occurred during the war years,\r\nalbeit lifting veils of censorship reveal how narrowly such explosions\r\nwere averted. Nevertheless, Asia and Africa are to-day in acute ferment,\r\nand we must not forget that this ferment is not primarily due to the war.\r\nThe war merely accelerated a movement already existent long before 1914.\r\nEven if the Great War had been averted, the twentieth century must have\r\nbeen a time of wide-spread racial readjustments in which the white man's\r\npresent position of political world-domination would have been sensibly\r\nmodified, especially in Asia. However, had the white race and white\r\ncivilization been spared the terrific material and moral losses involved\r\nin the Great War and its still unliquidated aftermath, the process of\r\nracial readjustment would have been far more gradual and would have been\r\nfraught with far fewer cataclysmic possibilities. Had white strength\r\nremained intact it would have acted as a powerful shock-absorber, taking\r\nup and distributing the various colored impacts. As a result, the coming\r\nmodification of the world's racial equilibrium, though inevitable, would\r\nhave been so graduated that it would have seemed more an evolution than a\r\nrevolution. Such violent breaches as did occur might have been localized,\r\nand anything like a general race-cataclysm would probably have been\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be. The heart of the white world was divided against\r\nitself, and on the fateful 1st of August, 1914, the white race, forgetting\r\nties of blood and culture, heedless of the growing pressure of the colored\r\nworld without, locked in a battle to the death. An ominous cycle opened\r\nwhose end no man can foresee. Armageddon engendered Versailles; earth's\r\nworst war closed with an unconstructive peace which left old sores\r\nunhealed and even dealt fresh wounds. The white world to-day lies\r\ndebilitated and uncured; the colored world views conditions which are a\r\nstanding incitement to rash dreams and violent action.\r\n\r\nSuch is the present status of the world's race-problem, expressed in\r\ngeneral terms. The analysis of the specific elements in that complex\r\nproblem will form the subject of the succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nYELLOW MAN'S LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nYellow Man's Land is the Far East. Here the group of kindred stocks\r\nusually termed Mongolian have dwelt for unnumbered ages. Down to the most\r\nrecent times the yellows lived virtually a life apart. Sundered from the\r\nrest of mankind by stupendous mountains, burning deserts, and the\r\nillimitable ocean, the Far East constituted a world in itself, living its\r\nown life and developing its own peculiar civilization. Only the wild\r\nnomads of its northern marches--Huns, Mongols, Tartars, and the\r\nlike--succeeded in gaining direct contact with the brown and white worlds\r\nto the West.\r\n\r\nThe ethnic focus of the yellow world has always been China. Since the dawn\r\nof history this immense human ganglion has been the centre from which\r\ncivilization has radiated throughout the Far East. About this \"Middle\r\nKingdom,\" as it sapiently styled itself, the other yellow folk were\r\ndisposed--Japanese and Koreans to the east; Siamese, Annamites, and\r\nCambodians to the south; and to the north the nomad Mongols and Manchus.\r\nTo all these peoples China was the august preceptor, sometimes chastising\r\ntheir presumption, yet always instilling the principles of its ordered\r\ncivilization. However diverse may have been the individual developments\r\nof the various Far Eastern peoples, they spring from a common Chinese\r\nfoundation. Despite modern Japan's meteoric rise to political mastery of\r\nthe Far East, it must not be forgotten that China remains not only the\r\ncultural but also the territorial and racial centre of the yellow world.\r\nFour-fifths of the yellow race is concentrated in China, there being\r\nnearly 400,000,000 Chinese as against 60,000,000 Japanese, 16,000,000\r\nKoreans, 26,000,000 Indo-Chinese, and perhaps 10,000,000 people of\r\nnon-Chinese stocks included within China's political frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe age-long seclusion of the yellow world, first decreed by nature, was\r\nsubsequently maintained by the voluntary decision of the yellow peoples\r\nthemselves. The great expansive movement of the white race which began\r\nfour centuries ago soon brought white men to the Far East, by sea in the\r\npersons of the Portuguese navigators and by land with the Cossack\r\nadventurers ranging through the empty spaces of Siberia. Yet after a brief\r\nacquaintance with the white strangers the yellow world decided that it\r\nwanted none of them, and they were rigidly excluded. This exclusion policy\r\nwas not a Chinese peculiarity; it was common to all the yellow peoples and\r\nwas adopted spontaneously at about the same time. In China, Japan, Korea,\r\nand Indo-China, the same reaction produced the same results. The yellow\r\nworld instinctively felt the white man to be a destructive, dissolving\r\ninfluence on its highly specialized line of evolution, which it wished to\r\nmaintain unaltered. For three centuries the yellow world succeeded in\r\nmaintaining its isolation, then, in the middle of the last century,\r\ninsistent white pressure broke down the barriers and forced the yellow\r\nraces into full contact with the outer world.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the \"opening\" of the Far East was hailed by white men with\r\ngeneral approval, but of late years many white observers have regretted\r\nthis forcible dragging of reluctant races into the full stream of world\r\naffairs. As an Australian writer, J. Liddell Kelly, remarks: \"We have\r\nerred grievously by prematurely forcing ourselves upon Asiatic races. The\r\ninstinct of the Asiatic in desiring isolation and separation from other\r\nforms of civilization was much more correct than our craze for imposing\r\nour forms of religion, morals, and industrialism upon them. It is not\r\nrace-hatred, nor even race-antagonism, that is at the root of this\r\nattitude; it is an unerring intuition, which in years gone by has taught\r\nthe Asiatic that his evolution in the scale of civilization could best be\r\naccomplished by his being allowed to develop on his own lines. Pernicious\r\nEuropean compulsion has led him to abandon that attitude. Let us not be\r\nashamed to confess that he was right and we were wrong.\"[7]\r\n\r\nHowever, rightly or wrongly, the deed was done, and the yellow races,\r\nforced into the world-arena, proceeded to adapt themselves to their new\r\npolitical environment and to learn the correct methods of survival under\r\nthe strenuous conditions which there prevailed. In place of their\r\ntraditional equilibrated, self-sufficient order, the yellow peoples now\r\nfelt the ubiquitous impacts of the dynamic Western spirit, insistent upon\r\nrapid material progress and forceful, expansive evolution. Japan was the\r\nfirst yellow people to go methodically to the white man's school, and\r\nJapan's rapid acquirement of the white man's technology soon showed itself\r\nin dramatic demonstrations like her military triumphs over China in 1894,\r\nand over Russia a decade later.\r\n\r\nJapan's easy victory over huge China astounded the whole world. That these\r\n\"highly intelligent children,\" as one of the early British ministers to\r\nJapan had characterized them, should have so rapidly acquired the\r\ntechnique of Western methods was almost unbelievable. Indeed, the full\r\nsignificance of the lesson was not immediately grasped, and the power of\r\nNew Japan was still underestimated. A good example of Europe's\r\nunderestimation of Japanese strength was the proposal a Dutch writer made\r\nin 1896 to curb possible Japanese aggression on the Dutch Indies by taking\r\nfrom Japan the island of Formosa which Japan had acquired from China as\r\none of the fruits of victory. \"Holland,\" asserted this writer, \"must take\r\npossession of Formosa.\"[8] The grotesqueness of this dictum as it appears\r\nto us in the light of subsequent history shows how the world has moved in\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\nBut even at that time Japan's expansionist tendencies were well\r\ndeveloped, and voices were warning against Japanese imperialism. In the\r\nvery month when our Hollander was advocating a Dutch seizure of Formosa,\r\nan Australian wrote the following lines in a Melbourne newspaper\r\nconcerning his recent travels in Japan: \"While in a car with several\r\nJapanese officers, they were conversing about Australia, saying that it\r\nwas a fine, large country, with great forests and excellent soil for the\r\ncultivation of rice and other products. The whites settled in Australia,\r\nso thought these officers, are like the dog in the manger. Some one will\r\nhave to take a good part of Australia to develop it, for it is a pity to\r\nsee so fine a country lying waste. If any ill-feeling arose between the\r\ntwo countries, it would be a wise thing to send some battleships to\r\nAustralia and annex part of it.\"[9]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the world's misreading of the Chino-Japanese\r\nconflict, the same cannot be said of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. The\r\nechoes of that yellow triumph over one of the great white Powers\r\nreverberated to the ends of the earth and started obscure trains of\r\nconsequences even to-day not yet fully disclosed. The war's reactions in\r\nthese remoter fields will be discussed in later chapters. Its effect upon\r\nthe Far East is our present concern. And the well-nigh unanimous opinion\r\nof both natives and resident Europeans was that the war signified a\r\nbody-blow to white ascendancy. So profound an English student of the\r\nOrient as Meredith Townsend wrote: \"It may be taken as certain that the\r\nvictory of Japan will be profoundly felt by the majority of European\r\nstates. With the exception of Austria, all European countries have\r\nimplicated themselves in the great effort to conquer Asia, which has now\r\nbeen going on for two centuries, but which, as this author thinks, must\r\nnow terminate.... The disposition, therefore, to edge out intrusive\r\nEuropeans from their Asiatic possessions is certain to exist even if it is\r\nnot manifested in Tokio, and it may be fostered by a movement of which, as\r\nyet, but little has been said. No one who has ever studied the question\r\ndoubts that as there is a comity of Europe, so there is a comity of Asia,\r\na disposition to believe that Asia belongs of right to Asiatics, and that\r\nany event which brings that right nearer to realization is to all Asiatics\r\na pleasurable one. Japanese victories will give new heart and energy to\r\nall the Asiatic nations and tribes which now fret under European rule,\r\nwill inspire in them a new confidence in their own power to resist, and\r\nwill spread through them a strong impulse to avail themselves of Japanese\r\ninstruction. It will take, of course, many years to bring this new force\r\ninto play; but time matters nothing to Asiatics, and they all possess that\r\ncapacity for complete secrecy which the Japanese displayed.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThat Meredith Townsend was reading the Asiatic mind aright seems clear\r\nfrom the pronouncements of Orientals themselves. For example, _Buddhism_,\r\nof Rangoon, Burmah, a country of the Indo-Chinese borderland between the\r\nyellow and brown worlds, expressed hopes for an Oriental alliance against\r\nthe whites. \"It would, we think,\" said this paper, \"be no great wonder if\r\na few years after the conclusion of this war saw the completion of a\r\ndefensive alliance between Japan, China, and not impossibly Siam--the\r\nformulation of a new Monroe Doctrine for the Far East, guaranteeing the\r\nintegrity of existing states against further aggression from the West. The\r\nWest has justified--perhaps with some reason--every aggression on weaker\r\nraces by the doctrine of the Survival of the Fittest; on the ground that\r\nit is best for future humanity that the unfit should be eliminated and\r\ngive place to the most able race. That doctrine applies equally well to\r\nany possible struggle between Aryan and Mongolian--whichever survives,\r\nshould it ever come to a struggle between the two for world-mastery, will,\r\non their own doctrine, be the one most fit to do so, and if the survivor\r\nbe the Mongolian, then is the Mongolian no 'peril' to humanity, but the\r\nbetter part of it.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe decade which elapsed between the Russo-Japanese and European Wars saw\r\nin the Far East another event of the first magnitude: the Chinese\r\nRevolution of 1911. Toward the close of the nineteenth century the world\r\nhad been earnestly discussing the \"break-up\" of China. The huge empire,\r\nwith its 400,000,000 of people, one-fourth the entire human race, seemed\r\nat that time plunged in so hopeless a lethargy as to be foredoomed to\r\nspeedy ruin. About the apparently moribund carcass the eagles of the earth\r\nwere already gathered, planning a \"partition of China\" analogous to the\r\nrecent partition of Africa. The partition of China, however, never came\r\noff. The prodigious moral shock of the Japanese War roused China's elite\r\nto the imminence of their country's peril. First attempts at reform were\r\nblocked by the Dowager Empress, but her reactionary lurch ended in the\r\nBoxer nightmare and the frightful Occidental chastisement of 1900. This\r\ntime the lesson was learned. China was at last shaken broad awake. The\r\nBourbon Manchu court, it is true, wavered, but popular pressure forced it\r\nto keep the upward path. Every year after 1900 saw increasingly rapid\r\nreform--reform, be it noted, not imposed upon the country from above but\r\nforced upon the rulers from below. When the slow-footed Manchus showed\r\nthemselves congenitally incapable of keeping step with the quickening\r\nnational pace, the rising tide of national life overwhelmed them in the\r\nRepublican Revolution of 1911, and they were no more.\r\n\r\nEven with the Manchu handicap, the rate of progress during those years was\r\nsuch as to amaze the wisest foreign observers. \"Could the sage, Confucius,\r\nhave returned a decade ago,\" wrote that \"old China hand,\" W. R. Manning,\r\nin 1910, \"he would have felt almost as much at home as when he departed\r\ntwenty-five centuries before. Should he return a decade hence he will feel\r\nalmost as much out of place as Rip Van Winkle, if the recent rate of\r\nprogress continues.\"[12] Toward the close of 1909 a close student of\r\nthings Chinese, Harlan P. Beach, remarked: \"Those who, like myself, can\r\ncompare the China of twenty-five years ago with the China of this year,\r\ncan hardly believe our senses.\"[13] It was on top of all this that there\r\ncame the revolution, a happening hailed by so sophisticated an observer as\r\nDoctor Dillon as \"the most momentous event in a thousand years.\"[14]\r\nWhatever may have been the political blunders of the revolutionists (and\r\nthey were many), the revolution's moral results were stupendous. The\r\nstream of Western innovation flowed at a vastly accelerated pace into\r\nevery Chinese province. The popular masses were for the first time\r\nawakened to genuine interest in political, as distinguished from economic\r\nor personal, questions. Lastly, the semi-religious feeling of family\r\nkinship, which in the past had been almost the sole recognized bond of\r\nChinese race-solidarity, was powerfully supplemented by those\r\ndistinctively modern concepts, national self-consciousness and articulate\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\nHere was the Far Eastern situation at the outbreak of the Great War--a\r\nthoroughly modernized, powerful Japan, and a thoroughly aroused, but still\r\ndisorganized, China. The Great War automatically made Japan supreme in the\r\nFar East by temporarily reducing all the European Powers to ciphers in\r\nOriental affairs. How Japan proceeded to buttress this supremacy by\r\ngetting a strangle-hold on China, every one knows. Japan's methods were\r\nbrutal and cynical, though not a whit more so than the methods employed by\r\nwhite nations seeking to attain vital ends. And \"vital\" is precisely how\r\nJapan regards her hold over China. An essentially poor country with a\r\nteeming population, Japan feels that the exploitation of China's\r\nincalculable natural resources, a privileged position in the Chinese\r\nmarket, and guidance of Chinese national evolution in ways not inimical to\r\nJapan, can alone assure her future.\r\n\r\nJapan's attitude toward her huge neighbor is one of mingled superiority\r\nand apprehension. She banks on China's traditional pacifism, yet she is\r\ntoo shrewd not to realize the explosive possibilities latent in the modern\r\nnationalist idea. As a Japanese publicist, Adachi Kinnosuke, remarks: \"The\r\nTwentieth Century Jenghiz Khan threatening the Sun-Flag with a Mongol\r\nhorde armed with Krupp guns may possibly strike the Western sense of\r\nhumor. But it is not altogether pleasing to contemplate a neighbor of\r\n400,000,000 population with modern armament and soldiers trained on the\r\nmodern plan. The awakening of China means all this and a little more which\r\nwe of the present are not sure of. Japan cannot forget that between this\r\nnightmare of armed China and herself there is only a very narrow sea.\"[15]\r\nCertainly, \"Young China\" has already displayed much of that unpleasant\r\nebullience which usually accompanies nationalist awakenings. A French\r\nobserver, Jean Rodes, writes on this point: \"One of the things that most\r\ndisquiet thinking men is that this new generation, completely neglecting\r\nChinese studies while knowing nothing of Western science, yet convinced\r\nthat it knows everything, will no longer possess any standard of values,\r\nnational culture, or foreign culture. We can only await with apprehension\r\nthe results of such ignorance united with unbounded pride as characterize\r\nthe Chinese youth of to-day.\"[16] And another French observer, Rene Pinon,\r\nas far back as 1905, found the primary school children of Kiang-Su\r\nprovince chanting the following lines: \"I pray that the frontiers of my\r\ncountry become hard as bronze; that it surpass Europe and America; that it\r\nsubjugate Japan; that its land and sea armies cover themselves with\r\nresplendent glory; that over the whole earth float the Dragon Standard;\r\nthat the universal mastery of the empire extend and progress. May our\r\nempire, like a sleeping tiger suddenly awakened, spring roaring into the\r\narena of combats.\"[17]\r\n\r\nJapan's masterful policy in China is thus unquestionably hazardous.\r\nChinese national feeling is to-day genuinely aroused against Japan, and\r\nresentment over Japanese encroachments is bitter and wide-spread.\r\nNevertheless, Japan feels that the game is worth the risk and believes\r\nthat both Chinese race-psychology and the general drift of world affairs\r\ncombine to favor her ultimate success. She knows that China has in the\r\npast always acquiesced in foreign domination when resistance has proved\r\npatently impossible. She also feels that her aspirations for white\r\nexpulsion from the Far East and for the winning of wider spheres for\r\nracial expansion should appeal strongly to yellow peoples generally and to\r\nthe Chinese in particular. To turn China's nascent nationalism into purely\r\nanti-white channels and to transmute Chinese patriotism into a wider\r\n\"Pan-Mongolism\" would constitute a Japanese triumph of incalculable\r\nsplendor. It would increase her effective force manyfold and would open up\r\nalmost limitless vistas of power and glory.\r\n\r\nNor are the Chinese themselves blind to the advantages of Chino-Japanese\r\nco-operation. They have an instinctive assurance in their own capacities,\r\nthey know how they have ultimately digested all their conquerors, and many\r\nChinese to-day think that from a Chino-Japanese partnership, no matter how\r\nframed, the inscrutable \"Sons of Han\" would eventually get the lion's\r\nshare. Certainly no one has ever denied the Chinaman's extraordinary\r\neconomic efficiency. Winnowed by ages of grim elimination in a land\r\npopulated to the uttermost limits of subsistence, the Chinese race is\r\nselected as no other for survival under the fiercest conditions of\r\neconomic stress. At home the average Chinese lives his whole life\r\nliterally within a hand's breadth of starvation. Accordingly, when removed\r\nto the easier environment of other lands, the Chinaman brings with him a\r\nworking capacity which simply appalls his competitors. That urbane\r\nCelestial, Doctor Wu-Ting-Fang, well says of his own people: \"Experience\r\nproves that the Chinese as all-round laborers can easily outdistance all\r\ncompetitors. They are industrious, intelligent, and orderly. They can work\r\nunder conditions that would kill a man of less hardy race; in heat that\r\nwould kill a salamander, or in cold that would please a polar bear,\r\nsustaining their energies through long hours of unremitting toil with only\r\na few bowls of rice.\"[18] This Chinese estimate is echoed by the most\r\ncompetent foreign observers. The Australian thinker, Charles H. Pearson,\r\nwrote of the Chinese a generation ago in his epoch-making book, \"National\r\nLife and Character\": \"Flexible as Jews, they can thrive on the mountain\r\nplateaux of Thibet and under the sun of Singapore; more versatile even\r\nthan Jews, they are excellent laborers, and not without merit as soldiers\r\nand sailors; while they have a capacity for trade which no other nation of\r\nthe East possesses. They do not need even the accident of a man of genius\r\nto develop their magnificent future.\"[19] And Lafcadio Hearn says: \"A\r\npeople of hundreds of millions disciplined for thousands of years to the\r\nmost untiring industry and the most self-denying thrift, under conditions\r\nwhich would mean worse than death for our working masses--a people, in\r\nshort, quite content to strive to the uttermost in exchange for the simple\r\nprivilege of life.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThis economic superiority of the Chinaman shows not only with other races,\r\nbut with his yellow kindred as well. As regards the Japanese, John\r\nChinaman has proved it to the hilt. Wherever the two have met in economic\r\ncompetition, John has won hands down. Even in Japanese colonies like Korea\r\nand Formosa, the Japanese, with all the backing of their government behind\r\nthem, have been worsted. In fact, Japan itself, so bitter at white\r\nrefusals to receive her emigrants, has been obliged to enact drastic\r\nexclusion laws to protect her working classes from the influx of \"Chinese\r\ncheap labor.\" It seems, therefore, a just calculation when Chinese\r\nestimate that Japanese triumphs against white adversaries would inure\r\nlargely to China's benefit. After all, Chinese and Japanese are\r\nfundamentally of the same race and culture. They may have their very\r\nbitter family quarrels, but in the last analysis they understand each\r\nother and may arrive at surprisingly sudden agreements. One thing is\r\ncertain: both these over-populated lands will feel increasingly the\r\nimperious need of racial expansion. For all these reasons, then, the\r\npresent political tension between China and Japan cannot be reckoned as\r\npermanent, and we would do well to envisage the possibility of close\r\nChinese co-operation in the ambitious programme of Japanese foreign\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThis Japanese programme looks first to the prevention of all further white\r\nencroachment in the Far East by the establishment of a Far Eastern Monroe\r\nDoctrine based on Japanese predominance and backed if possible by the\r\nmoral support of the other Far Eastern peoples. The next stage in Japanese\r\nforeign policy seems to be the systematic elimination of all existing\r\nwhite holdings in the Far East. Thus far practically all Japanese appear\r\nto be in substantial agreement. Beyond this point lies a wide realm of\r\naspiration ranging from determination to secure complete racial equality\r\nand freedom of immigration into white lands to imperialistic dreams of\r\nwholesale conquests and \"world-dominion.\" These last items do not\r\nrepresent the united aspiration of the Japanese nation, but they are\r\ncherished by powerful circles which, owing to Japan's oligarchical system\r\nof government, possess an influence over governmental action quite\r\ndisproportionate to their numbers.\r\n\r\nAlthough Japanese plans and aspirations have broadened notably since 1914,\r\ntheir outlines were well defined a decade earlier. Immediately after her\r\nvictory over Russia, Japan set herself to strengthen her influence all\r\nover eastern Asia. Special efforts were made to establish intimate\r\nrelations with the other Asiatic peoples. Asiatic students were invited to\r\nattend Japanese universities and as a matter of fact did attend by the\r\nthousand, while a whole series of societies was formed having for their\r\nobject the knitting of close cultural and economic ties between Japan and\r\nspecific regions like China, Siam, the Pacific, and even India. The\r\ncapstone was a \"Pan-Asiatic Association,\" founded by Count Okuma. Some of\r\nthe facts regarding these societies, about which too little is known, make\r\ninteresting reading. For instance, there was the \"Pacific Ocean Society\"\r\n(\"Taheijoka\"), whose preamble reads in part: \"For a century the Pacific\r\nOcean has been a battle-ground wherein the nations have struggled for\r\nsupremacy. To-day the prosperity or decadence of a nation depends on its\r\npower in the Pacific: to possess the empire of the Pacific is to be the\r\nMaster of the World. As Japan finds itself at the centre of that Ocean,\r\nwhose waves bathe its shores, it must reflect carefully and have clear\r\nviews on Pacific questions.\"[21]\r\n\r\nEqually interesting is the \"Indo-Japanese Association,\" whose activities\r\nappear somewhat peculiar in view of the political alliance between Japan\r\nand the British Empire. One of the first articles of its constitution\r\n(from Count Okuma's pen, by the way) reads: \"All men were born equal. The\r\nAsiatics have the same claim to be called men as the Europeans themselves.\r\nIt is therefore quite unreasonable that the latter should have any right\r\nto predominate over the former.\"[22] No mention is made anywhere in the\r\ndocument of India's political connection with England. In fact, Count\r\nOkuma, in the autumn of 1907, had this to say regarding India: \"Being\r\noppressed by the Europeans, the 300,000,000 people of India are looking\r\nfor Japanese protection. They have commenced to boycott European\r\nmerchandise. If, therefore, the Japanese let the chance slip by and do not\r\ngo to India, the Indians will be disappointed. From old times, India has\r\nbeen a land of treasure. Alexander the Great obtained there treasure\r\nsufficient to load a hundred camels, and Mahmoud and Attila also obtained\r\nriches from India. Why should not the Japanese stretch out their hands\r\ntoward that country, now that the people are looking to the Japanese? The\r\nJapanese ought to go to India, the South Ocean, and other parts of the\r\nworld.\"[23]\r\n\r\nIn 1910, Putnam Weale, a competent English student of Oriental affairs,\r\nasserted: \"It can no longer be doubted that a very deliberate policy is\r\ncertainly being quietly and cleverly pursued. Despite all denials, it is a\r\nfact that Japan has already a great hold in the schools and in the\r\nvernacular newspapers all over eastern Asia, and that the gospel of 'Asia\r\nfor the Asiatics' is being steadily preached not only by her schoolmasters\r\nand her editors, but by her merchants and peddlers, and every other man\r\nwho travels.\"[24]\r\n\r\nExactly how much these Japanese propagandist efforts accomplished is\r\nimpossible to say. Certain it is, however, that during the years just\r\nprevious to the Great War the white colonies in the Far East were\r\nafflicted with considerable native unrest. In French Indo-China, for\r\nexample, revolutionary movements during the year 1908 necessitated\r\nreinforcing the French garrison by nearly 10,000 men, and though the\r\ndisturbances were sternly repressed, fresh conspiracies were discovered\r\nin 1911 and 1913. Much sedition and some sharp fighting also took place in\r\nthe Dutch Indies, while in the Philippines the independence movement\r\ncontinued to gain ground.\r\n\r\nWhat the growing self-consciousness of the Far East portended for the\r\nwhite man's ultimate status in those regions was indicated by an English\r\npublicist, J. D. Whelpley, who wrote, shortly after the outbreak of the\r\nEuropean War: \"With the aid of Western ideas the Far East is fast\r\nattaining a solidarity impossible under purely Oriental methods. The smug\r\nsatisfaction expressed in the West at what is called the 'modernization'\r\nof the East shows lack of wisdom or an ineffective grasp of the meaning of\r\ncomparatively recent events in Japan, China, eastern Siberia, and even in\r\nthe Philippines. In years past the solidarity of the Far East was largely\r\nin point of view, while in other matters the powerful nations of the West\r\nplayed the game according to their own rules. To-day the solidarity of\r\nmental outlook still maintains, while in addition there is rapidly coming\r\nabout a solidarity of political and material interests which in time will\r\nreduce Western participation in Far Eastern affairs to that of a\r\ncomparatively unimportant factor. It might truly be said that this point\r\nis already reached, and that it only needs an application of the test to\r\nprove to the world that the Far East would resent Western interference as\r\nan intolerable impertinence.\"[25]\r\n\r\nThe scope of Japan's aspirations, together with differences of outlook\r\nbetween various sections of Japanese public opinion as to the rate of\r\nprogress feasible for Japanese expansion, account for Japan's differing\r\nattitudes toward the white Powers. Officially, the keystone of Japan's\r\nforeign policy since the beginning of the present century has been the\r\nalliance with England, first negotiated in 1902 and renewed with extensive\r\nmodifications in 1911. The 1902 alliance was universally popular in Japan.\r\nIt was directed specifically against Russia and represented the common\r\napprehensions of both the contracting parties. By 1911, however, the\r\nsituation had radically altered. Japan's aspirations in the Far East,\r\nparticularly as regards China, were arousing wide-spread uneasiness in\r\nmany quarters, and the English communities in the Far East generally\r\ncondemned the new alliance as a gross blunder of British diplomacy. In\r\nJapan also there was considerable protest. The official organs, to be\r\nsure, stressed the necessity of friendship with the Mistress of the Seas\r\nfor an island empire like Japan, but opposition circles pointed to\r\nEngland's practical refusal to be drawn into a war with the United States\r\nunder any circumstances which constituted the outstanding feature of the\r\nnew treaty and declared that Japan was giving much and receiving nothing\r\nin return.\r\n\r\nThe growing divergence between Japanese and English views regarding China\r\nincreased anti-English feeling, and in 1912 the semi-official _Japan\r\nMagazine_ asserted roundly that the general feeling in Japan was that the\r\nalliance was a detriment rather than a benefit, going on to forecast a\r\npossible alignment with Russia and Germany, and remarking of the latter:\r\n\"Germany's healthy imperialism and scientific development would have a\r\nwholesome effect upon our nation and progress, while the German habit of\r\nperseverance and frugality is just what we need. German wealth and\r\nindustry are gradually creeping upward to that of Great Britain and\r\nAmerica, and the efficiency of the German army and navy is a model for the\r\nworld. Her lease of the territory of Kiaochow Bay brings her into contact\r\nwith us, and her ambition to exploit the coal-mines of Shantung lends her\r\na community of interest with us. It is not too much to say that German\r\ninterests in China are greater than those of any other European Power. If\r\nthe alliance with England should ever be abrogated, we might be very glad\r\nto shake hands with Germany.\"[26]\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the European War gave Japan a golden opportunity (of which\r\nshe was not slow to take advantage) to eliminate one of the white Powers\r\nfrom the Far East. The German stronghold of Kiaochow was promptly reduced,\r\nwhile Germany's possessions in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator, the\r\nCaroline, Pelew, Marianne, and Marshall island-groups, were likewise\r\noccupied by Japanese forces. Here Japan stopped and politely declined all\r\nproposals to send armies to Europe or western Asia. Her sphere was the Far\r\nEast; her real objectives were the reduction of white influence there and\r\nthe riveting of her control over China. Japanese comment was perfectly\r\ncandid on these matters. As the semi-official _Japanese Colonial Journal_\r\nput it in the autumn of 1914: \"To protect Chinese territory Japan is ready\r\nto fight no matter what nation. Not only will Japan try to erase the\r\nambitions of Russia and Germany; it will also do its best to prevent\r\nEngland and the United States from touching the Chinese cake. The solution\r\nof the Chinese problem is of great importance for Japan, and Great Britain\r\nhas little to do with it.\"[27]\r\n\r\nEqually frank were Japanese warnings to the English ally not to oppose\r\nJapan's progress in China. English criticism of the series of ultimatums\r\nby which Japan forced reluctant China to do her bidding roused angry\r\nadmonitions like the following from the Tokio _Universe_ in April, 1915:\r\n\"Hostile English opinion seems to want to oppose Japanese demands in\r\nChina. The English forget that Japan has, by her alliance, rendered them\r\nsignal services against Russia in 1905 and in the present war by assuring\r\nsecurity in their colonies of the Pacific and the Far East. If Japan\r\nallied herself with England, it was with the object of establishing\r\nJapanese preponderance in China and against the encroachments of Russia.\r\nTo-day the English seem to be neglecting their obligations toward Japan by\r\nnot supporting her cause. Let England beware! Japan will tolerate no\r\nwavering; she is quite ready to abandon the Anglo-Japanese alliance and\r\nturn to Russia--a Power with whom she can agree perfectly regarding Far\r\nEastern interests. In the future, even, she is ready to draw closer to\r\nGermany. The English colonies will then be in great peril.\"[28]\r\n\r\nAs to the imminence of a Russo-Japanese understanding, the journal just\r\nquoted proved a true prophet, for a year later, in July, 1916, the\r\nJapanese and Russian Governments signed a diplomatic instrument which\r\namounted practically to an alliance. By this document Russia recognized\r\nJapan's paramountcy over the bulk of China, while Japan recognized\r\nRussia's special interests in China's Western dependencies, Mongolia and\r\nTurkestan. Japan had thus eliminated another of the white Powers from the\r\nFar East, since Russia renounced those ambitions to dominate China proper\r\nwhich had provoked the war of 1904.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the press campaign against England continued. A typical sample\r\nis this editorial from the Tokio _Yamato_: \"Great Britain never wished at\r\nheart to become Japan's ally. She did not wish to enter into such intimate\r\nrelations with us, for she privately regarded us as an upstart nation\r\nradically different from us in blood and religion. It was simply the force\r\nof circumstances which compelled her to enter into an alliance with us. It\r\nis the height of conceit on our part to think that England really cared\r\nfor our friendship, for she never did. It was the Russian menace to India\r\nand Persia on the one hand, and the German ascendancy on the other, which\r\ncompelled her to clasp our hands.\"[29]\r\n\r\nAt the same time many good things were being said about Germany. At no\r\ntime during the war was any real hostility to the Germans apparent in\r\nJapan. Germany was of course expelled from her Far Eastern footholds in\r\nsmart, workmanlike fashion, but the fighting before Kiaochow was conducted\r\nwithout a trace of hatred, the German prisoners were treated as honored\r\ncaptives, and German civilians in Japan suffered no molestation. Japanese\r\nwriters were very frank in stating that, once Germany resigned herself to\r\nexclusion from the Far East and acquiesced in Japanese predominance in\r\nChina, no reason existed why Japan and Germany should not be good friends.\r\nUnofficial diplomatic exchanges certainly took place between the two\r\ngovernments during the war, and no rancor for the past appears to exist on\r\neither side to-day.\r\n\r\nThe year 1917 brought three momentous modifications into the\r\nworld-situation: the entrance of the United States and China into the\r\nGreat War and the Russian Revolution. The first two were intensely\r\ndistasteful to Japan. The transformation of virtually unarmed America into\r\na first-class fighting power reacted portentously upon the Far East, while\r\nChina's adhesion to the Grand Alliance (bitterly opposed in Tokio) rescued\r\nher from diplomatic isolation and gave her potential friends. The Russian\r\nRevolution was also a source of perplexity to Tokio. In 1916, as we have\r\nseen, Japan had arrived at a thorough understanding with the Czarist\r\nregime. The new Russian Government was an unknown quantity, acting quite\r\ndifferently from the old.\r\n\r\nRussia's collapse into Bolshevist anarchy, however, presently opened up\r\nnew vistas. Not merely northern Manchuria, but also the huge expanse of\r\nSiberia, an almost empty world of vast potential riches, lay temptingly\r\nexposed. At once the powerful imperialist elements in Japanese political\r\nlife began clamoring for \"forward\" action. An opportunity for such action\r\nwas soon vouchsafed by the Allied determination to send a composite force\r\nto Siberia to checkmate the machinations of the Russian Bolsheviki, now\r\nhostile to the Allies and playing into the hands of Germany. The\r\nimperialist party at Tokio took the bit in its teeth, and, in flagrant\r\ndisregard of the inter-Allied agreement, poured a great army into Siberia,\r\noccupying the whole country as far west as Lake Baikal. This was in the\r\nspring of 1918. The Allies, then in their supreme death-grapple with the\r\nGermans, dared not even protest, but in the autumn, when the battle-tide\r\nhad turned in Europe, Japan was called to account, the United States\r\ntaking the lead in the matter. A furious debate ensued at Tokio between\r\nthe imperialist and moderate parties, the hotter jingoes urging defiance\r\nof the United States even at the risk of war. Then, suddenly, came the\r\nnews that Germany was cracking, and the moderates had their way. The\r\nJapanese armies in Siberia were reduced, albeit they still remained the\r\nmost powerful military factor in the situation.\r\n\r\nGermany's sudden collapse and the unexpectedly quick ending of the war was\r\na blow to Japanese hopes and plans in more ways than one. Despite\r\nofficial felicitations, the nation could hardly disguise its chagrin. For\r\nJapan the war had been an unmixed benefit. It had automatically made her\r\nmistress of the Far East and had amazingly enriched her economic life.\r\nEvery succeeding month of hostilities had seen the white world grow weaker\r\nand had conversely increased Japanese power. Japan had counted on at least\r\none more year of war. Small wonder that the sudden passing of this halcyon\r\ntime provoked disappointment and regret.\r\n\r\nThe above outline of Japanese foreign policy reveals beneath all its\r\nsurface mutations a fundamental continuity. Whatever may be its ultimate\r\ngoals, Japanese foreign policy has one minimum objective: Japan as hegemon\r\nof a Far East in which white influence shall have been reduced to a\r\nvanishing quantity. That is the bald truth of the matter--and no white man\r\nhas any reason for getting indignant about it. Granted that Japanese aims\r\nendanger white vested interests in the Far East. Granted that this\r\ninvolves rivalry and perhaps war. That is no reason for striking a moral\r\nattitude and inveighing against Japanese \"wickedness,\" as many people are\r\nto-day doing. These mighty racial tides flow from the most elemental of\r\nvital urges: self-expansion and self-preservation. Both outward thrust of\r\nexpanding life and counter-thrust of threatened life are equally normal\r\nphenomena. To condemn the former as \"criminal\" and the latter as \"selfish\"\r\nis either silly or hypocritical and tends to envenom with unnecessary\r\nrancor what objective fairness might keep a candid struggle, inevitable\r\nyet alleviated by mutual comprehension and respect. This is no mere plea\r\nfor \"sportsmanship\"; it is a very practical matter. There are critical\r\ntimes ahead; times in which intense race-pressures will engender high\r\ntensions and perhaps wars. If men will keep open minds and will eschew the\r\ntemptation to regard those opposing their desires to defend or possess\r\nrespectively as impious fiends, the struggles will lose half their\r\nbitterness, and the wars (if wars there must be) will be shorn of half\r\ntheir ferocity.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected ending of the European War was, as we have seen, a blow to\r\nJapanese calculations. Nevertheless, the skill of her diplomats at the\r\nensuing Versailles Conference enabled Japan to harvest most of her war\r\ngains. Japan's territorial acquisitions in China were definitely written\r\ninto the peace treaty, despite China's sullen veto, and Japan's\r\npreponderance in Chinese affairs was tacitly acknowledged. Japan also took\r\nadvantage of the occasion to pose as the champion of the colored races by\r\nurging the formal promulgation of \"racial equality\" as part of the peace\r\nsettlement, especially as regards immigration. Of course the Japanese\r\ndiplomats had no serious expectation of their demands being acceded to; in\r\nfact, they might have been rather embarrassed if they had succeeded, in\r\nview of Japan's own stringent laws against immigration and alien\r\nlandholding. Nevertheless, it was a politic move, useful for future\r\npropagandist purposes, and it advertised Japan broadcast as the\r\nstandard-bearer of the colored cause.\r\n\r\nThe notable progress that Japan has made toward the mastery of the Far\r\nEast is written plainly upon the map, which strikingly portrays the\r\nbroadening territorial base of Japanese power effected in the past\r\ntwenty-five years. Japan now owns the whole island chain masking the\r\neastern sea frontage of Asia, from the tip of Kamchatka to the\r\nPhilippines, while her acquisition of Germany's Oceanican islands north of\r\nthe equator gives her important strategic outposts in mid-Pacific. Her\r\nbridge-heads on the Asiatic continent are also strong and well located.\r\nFrom the Korean peninsula (now an integral part of Japan) she firmly\r\ngrasps the vast Chinese dependency of Manchuria, while just south of\r\nManchuria across the narrow waters of the Pechili strait lies the rich\r\nChinese province of Shantung, become a Japanese sphere of influence as a\r\nresult of the late war. Thus Japan holds China's capital, Peking, as in\r\nthe jaws of a vice and can apply military pressure whenever she so\r\ndesires. In southern China lies another Japanese sphere of influence, the\r\nprovince of Fukien opposite the Japanese island of Formosa. Lastly, all\r\nover China runs a veritable network of Japanese concessions like the\r\nrecently acquired control of the great iron deposits near Hankow, far up\r\nthe Yangtse River in the heart of China.\r\n\r\nWhether this Japanese _imperium_ over China maintains itself or not, one\r\nthing seems certain: future white expansion in the Far East has become\r\nimpossible. Any such attempt would instantly weld together Japanese\r\nimperialism and Chinese nationalism in a \"sacred union\" whose result would\r\nprobably be at the very least the prompt expulsion of the white man from\r\nevery foothold in eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nThat is what will probably come anyway as soon as Japan and China,\r\nimpelled by overcrowding and conscious of their united potentialities,\r\nshall have arrived at a genuine understanding. Since population-pressure\r\nseems to be the basic factor in the future course of Far Eastern affairs,\r\nit would be well to survey possible outlets for surplus population within\r\nthe Far East itself, in order to determine how much of this race-expansion\r\ncan be satisfied at home, thereby diminishing, or at least postponing,\r\nacute pressure upon the political and ethnic frontiers of the white world.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the population of Japan (approximately 60,000,000) is\r\nincreasing at the rate of about 800,000 per year. China has no modern\r\nvital statistics, but the annual increase of her 400,000,000 population,\r\nat the Japanese rate, would be 6,000,000. Now the settled parts of both\r\nJapan and China may be considered as fully populated so far as agriculture\r\nis concerned, further extensive increases of population being dependent\r\nupon the rise of machine industry. Both countries have, however, thinly\r\nsettled areas within their present political frontiers. Japan's northern\r\nisland of Hokkaido (Yezo) has a great amount of good agricultural land as\r\nyet almost unoccupied, some of her other island possessions offer minor\r\noutlets, while Korea and Manchuria afford extensive colonizing\r\npossibilities albeit Chinese and Korean competition preclude a Japanese\r\ncolonization on the scale which the size and natural wealth of these\r\nregions would at first sight seem to indicate. China has even more\r\nextensive colonizable areas. Both Mongolia and Chinese Turkestan, though\r\nlargely desert, contain within their vast areas enough fertile land to\r\nsupport many millions of Chinese peasants as soon as modern roads and\r\nrailways are built. The Chinese colonization of Manchuria is also\r\nproceeding apace, and will continue despite anything Japan may do to keep\r\nit down. Lastly, the cold but enormous plateau of Tibet offers\r\nconsiderable possibilities.\r\n\r\nAllowing for all this, however, it cannot be said that either China or\r\nJapan possess within their present political frontiers territories likely\r\nto absorb those prodigious accretions of population which seem destined to\r\noccur within the next couple of generations. From the resultant congestion\r\ntwo avenues of escape will naturally present themselves: settlement of\r\nother portions of the Far East to-day under white political control, but\r\ninhabited by colored populations; and pressure into accessible areas not\r\nmerely under white political control, but also containing white\r\npopulations. It is obvious that these are two radically distinct issues,\r\nfor while a white nation might not unalterably oppose Mongolian\r\nimmigration into its colored dependencies, it would almost certainly\r\nfight to the limit rather than witness the racial swamping of lands\r\nsettled by its own flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nConsidering the former issue, then, it would appear that virtually all the\r\npeninsulas and archipelagoes lying between China and Australia offer\r\nattractive fields for yellow, particularly Chinese, race-expansion.\r\nEthnically they are all colored men's lands; politically they are all,\r\nsave Siam, under white control; Britain, France, Holland, and the United\r\nStates being the titular owners of these extensive territories. So far as\r\nthe native races are concerned, none of them seem to possess the vitality\r\nand economic efficiency needed to maintain themselves against unrestricted\r\nChinese immigration. Whether in the British Straits Settlements and North\r\nBorneo, French Indo-China, the Dutch Indies, the American Philippines, or\r\nindependent Siam, the Chinaman, so far as he has been allowed, has\r\ndisplayed his practical superiority, and in places where, like the Straits\r\nSettlements, he has been allowed a free hand, he has virtually supplanted\r\nthe native stock, reducing the latter to an impotent and vanishing\r\nminority. The chief barriers to Chinese race-expansion in these regions\r\nare legal hindrances or prohibitions of immigration, and of course such\r\nbarriers are in their essence artificial and liable to removal under any\r\nshift of circumstances. Many observers predict that most of these lands\r\nwill ultimately become Chinese. Says Alleyne Ireland, a recognized\r\nauthority on these regions: \"There is every reason to suppose that,\r\nthroughout the tropics, possibly excepting India, the Chinaman, even\r\nthough he should continue to emigrate in no greater force than hitherto,\r\nwill gradually supersede all the native races.\"[30] Certainly, if this be\r\ntrue, China has here a vast outlet for her surplus population. It has been\r\nestimated that the undeveloped portions of the Dutch Indies alone are\r\ncapable of supporting 100,000,000 people living on the frugal Chinese\r\nplane. Their present population is 8,000,000 semi-savages.\r\n\r\nChina's possibilities of race-expansion in the colored regions of the Far\r\nEast are thus excellent. The same cannot be said, however, for Japan. The\r\nJapanese, bred in a distinctively temperate, island environment, have not\r\nthe Chinese adaptability to climatic variation. The Japanese, like the\r\nwhite man, does not thrive in tropic heat, nor does he possess the white\r\nman's ability to resist sub-Arctic cold. Formosa is not in the real\r\ntropics, yet Japanese colonists have not done well there. On the other\r\nhand, even the far-from-Arctic winters of Hokkaido (part of the Japanese\r\narchipelago) seem too chilly for the Japanese taste.\r\n\r\nJapan thus does not have the same vital interest as China in the Asiatic\r\ntropics. Undoubtedly they would for Japan be valuable colonies of\r\nexploitation, just as they to-day are thus valuable for white nations. But\r\nthey could never furnish outlets for Japan's excess population, and even\r\ncommercially Japan would be exposed to increasing Chinese competition,\r\nsince the Chinaman excels the Japanese in trade as well as in migrant\r\ncolonization. Japanese lack of climatic adaptability is also the reason\r\nwhy Japan's present military excursion in eastern Siberia, even if it\r\nshould develop into permanent occupation, would yield no adequate solution\r\nof Japan's population problem. For the Chinaman, Siberia would do very\r\nwell. He would breed amazingly there and would fill up the whole country\r\nin a remarkably short space of time. But the Japanese peasant, so averse\r\nto the winters of Hokkaido, would find the sub-Arctic rigors of Siberia\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nThus, for Japanese migration, neither the empty spaces of northern or\r\nsouthern Asia will do. The natural outlets lie outside Asia in the United\r\nStates, Australasia, and the temperate parts of Latin America. But all\r\nthese outlets are rigorously barred by the white man, who has marked them\r\nfor his own race-heritage, and nothing but force will break those barriers\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThere lies a danger, not merely to the peace of the Far East, but to the\r\npeace of the world. Fired by a fervent patriotism; resolved to make their\r\ncountry a leader among the nations; the Japanese writhe at the\r\nconstriction of their present race-bounds. Placed on the flank of the\r\nChinese giant whose portentous growth she can accurately forecast, Japan\r\nsees herself condemned to ultimate renunciation of her grandiose ambitions\r\nunless she can somehow broaden the racial as well as the political basis\r\nof her power. In short: Japan must find lands where Japanese can breed by\r\nthe tens of millions if she is not to be automatically overshadowed in\r\ncourse of time, even assuming that she does not suffocate or blow up from\r\ncongestion before that time arrives. This is the secret of her aggressive\r\nforeign policy, her chronic imperialism, her extravagant dreams of\r\nconquest and \"world-dominion.\"\r\n\r\nThe longing to hack a path to greatness by the samurai sword lurks ever in\r\nthe back of Japanese minds. The library of Nippon's chauvinist literature\r\nis large and increasing. A good example of the earlier productions is\r\nSatori Kato's brochure entitled \"Mastery of the Pacific,\" published in\r\n1909. Herein the author announces confidently: \"In the event of war Japan\r\ncould, as if aided by a magician's wand, overrun the Pacific with fleets\r\nmanned by men who have made Nelson their model and transported to the\r\narmadas of the Far East the spirit that was victorious at Trafalgar.\r\nWhether Japan avows it or not, her persistent aim is to gain the mastery\r\nof the Pacific. Although peace seems to prevail over the world at present,\r\nno one can tell how soon the nations may be engaged in war. It does not\r\nneed the English alliance to secure success for Japan. That alliance may\r\nbe dissolved at any moment, but Japan will suffer no defeat. Her victory\r\nwill be won by her men, not by armor-plates--things weak by\r\ncomparison.\"[31]\r\n\r\nThe late war has of course greatly stimulated these bellicose emotions.\r\nViewing their own increased power and the debilitation of the white world,\r\nJapanese jingoes glimpse prospects of glorious fishing in troubled\r\nwaters. The \"world-dominion\" note is stressed more often than of yore. For\r\ninstance, in the summer of 1919 the Tokio _Hochi_, Count Okuma's organ,\r\nprophesied exultantly: \"That age in which the Anglo-Japanese alliance was\r\nthe pivot and American-Japanese co-operation an essential factor of\r\nJapanese diplomacy is gone. In future we must not look eastward for\r\nfriendship but westward. Let the Bolsheviki of Russia be put down and the\r\nmore peaceful party established in power. In them Japan will find a strong\r\nally. By marching then westward to the Balkans, to Germany, to France, and\r\nItaly, the greater part of the world may be brought under our sway. The\r\ntyranny of the Anglo-Saxons at the Peace Conference is such that it has\r\nangered both gods and men. Some may abjectly follow them in consideration\r\nof their petty interests, but things will ultimately settle down as has\r\njust been indicated.\"[32]\r\n\r\nStill more striking are the following citations from a Japanese\r\nimperialist pronouncement written in the autumn of 1916:\r\n\r\n\"Fifty millions of our race wherewith to conquer and possess the earth! It\r\nis indeed a glorious problem!... To begin with, we now have China; China\r\nis our steed! Far shall we ride upon her! Even as Rome rode Latium to\r\nconquer Italy, and Italy to conquer the Mediterranean; even as Napoleon\r\nrode Italy and the Rhenish States to conquer Germany, and Germany to\r\nconquer Europe; even as England to-day rides her colonies and her\r\nso-called 'allies' to conquer her robust rival, Germany--even so shall we\r\nride China. So becomes our 50,000,000 race 500,000,000 strong; so grow our\r\npaltry hundreds of millions of gold into billions!\r\n\r\n\"How well have done our people! How well have our statesmen led them! No\r\nmistakes! There must be none now. In 1895 we conquered China--Russia,\r\nGermany, and France stole from us the booty. How has our strength grown\r\nsince then--and still it grows! In ten years we punished and retook our\r\nown from Russia; in twenty years we squared and retook from Germany; with\r\nFrance there is no need for haste. She has already realized why we\r\nwithheld the troops which alone might have driven the invader from her\r\nsoil! Her fingers are clutching more tightly around her Oriental booty;\r\nyet she knows it is ours for the taking. But there is no need of haste:\r\nthe world condemns the paltry thief; only the glorious conqueror wins the\r\nplaudits and approval of mankind.\r\n\r\n\"We are now well astride of our steed, China; but the steed has long\r\nroamed wild and is run down: it needs grooming, more grain, more training.\r\nFurther, our saddle and bridle are as yet mere makeshifts: would steed and\r\ntrappings stand the strain of war? And what would that strain be?\r\n\r\n\"As for America--that fatuous booby with much money and much sentiment,\r\nbut no cohesion, no brains of government; stood she alone we should not\r\nneed our China steed. Well did my friend speak the other day when he\r\ncalled her people a race of thieves with the hearts of rabbits. America,\r\nto any warrior race, is not as a foe, but as an immense melon, ripe for\r\nthe cutting. But there are other warrior races--England, Germany--would\r\nthey look on and let us slice and eat our fill? Would they?\r\n\r\n\"But, using China as our steed, should our first goal be the land? India?\r\nOr the Pacific, the sea that must be our very own, even as the Atlantic is\r\nnow England's? The land is tempting and easy, but withal dangerous. Did we\r\nbegin there, the coarse white races would too soon awaken, and combine,\r\nand forever immure us within our long since grown intolerable bounds. It\r\nmust, therefore, be the sea; but the sea means the Western Americas and\r\nall the islands between; and with those must soon come Australia, India.\r\nAnd then the battling for the balance of world-power, for the rest of\r\nNorth America. Once that is ours, we own and control the whole--a dominion\r\nworthy of our race!\r\n\r\n\"North America alone will support a billion people; that billion shall be\r\nJapanese with their slaves. Not arid Asia, nor worn-out Europe (which,\r\nwith its peculiar and quaint relics and customs should in the interests of\r\nhistory and culture, be in any case preserved), nor yet tropical Africa,\r\nis fit for our people. But North America, that continent so succulently\r\ngreen, fresh, and unsullied--except for the few chattering, mongrel\r\nYankees--should have been ours by right of discovery: it shall be ours by\r\nthe higher, nobler right of conquest.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThis apostle of Japanese world-dominion then goes on to discuss in detail\r\nhow his programme can best be attained. It should be remembered that at\r\nthe time he wrote America was still an unarmed nation, apparently ridden\r\nby pacifism. Such imperialist extravagances as the above do not represent\r\nthe whole of Japan. But they do represent a powerful element in Japan,\r\nagainst which the white world should be forewarned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBROWN MAN'S LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nBrown Man's Land is the Near and Middle East. The brown world stretches in\r\nan immense belt clear across southern Asia and northern Africa, from the\r\nPacific to the Atlantic Oceans. The numbers of brown and yellow men are\r\nnot markedly unequal (450,000,000 browns as against 500,000,000 yellows),\r\nbut in most other respects the two worlds are sharply contrasted. In the\r\nfirst place, while the yellow world is a fairly compact geographical\r\nblock, the brown world sprawls half-way round the globe, and is not only\r\nmuch greater in size, but also infinitely more varied in natural features.\r\n\r\nThis geographical diversity is reflected both in its history and in the\r\ncharacter of its inhabitants. Unlike the secluded yellow world, the brown\r\nworld is nearly everywhere exposed to foreign influences and has undergone\r\nan infinite series of evolutionary modifications. Racially it has been a\r\nvast melting-pot, or series of melting-pots, wherein conquest and\r\nmigration have continually poured new heterogeneous elements, producing\r\nthe most diverse racial amalgamations. In fact, there is to-day no\r\ngeneralized brown type-norm as there are generalized yellow or white\r\ntype-norms, but rather a series of types clearly distinguished from one\r\nanother. Some of these types, like the Persians and Ottoman Turks, are\r\nlargely white; others, like the southern Indians and Yemenite Arabs, are\r\nlargely black; while still others, like the Himalayan and Central Asian\r\npeoples, have much yellow blood. Again, there is no generalized brown\r\nculture like those possessed by yellows and whites. The great spiritual\r\nbond is Islam, yet in India, the chief seat of brown population, Islam is\r\nprofessed by only one-fifth of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is a fundamental comity between the brown peoples.\r\nThis comity is subtle and intangible in character, yet it exists, and\r\nunder certain circumstances it is capable of momentous manifestations. Its\r\nsalient feature is the instinctive recognition by all Near and Middle\r\nEastern peoples that they are fellow Asiatics, however bitter may be their\r\ninternecine feuds. This instinctive Asiatic feeling has been noted by\r\nhistorians for more than two thousand years, and it is just as true to-day\r\nas in the past. Of course it comes out most strongly in face of the\r\nnon-Asiatic--which in practice has always meant the white man. The action\r\nand reaction of the brown and white worlds has, indeed, been a constant\r\nhistoric factor, the roles of hammer and anvil being continually reversed\r\nthrough the ages. For the last four centuries the white world has, in the\r\nmain, been the dynamic factor. Certainly, during the last hundred years\r\nthe white world has displayed an unprecedentedly aggressive vigor, the\r\nbrown world playing an almost passive role.\r\n\r\nHere again is seen a difference between browns and yellows. The yellow\r\nworld did not feel the full tide of white aggression till the middle of\r\nthe last century, while even then it never really lost its political\r\nindependence and soon reacted so powerfully that its political freedom has\r\nto-day been substantially regained. The brown world, on the other hand,\r\nfelt the impact of the white tide much earlier and was politically\r\noverwhelmed. The so-called \"independence\" of brown states has long been\r\ndue more to white rivalries than to their own inherent strength. One by\r\none they have been swallowed up by the white Powers. In 1914 only three\r\n(Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan) survived, and the late war has sent them\r\nthe way of the rest. Turkey and Persia have lost their independence,\r\nhowever they may still be painted on the map, while Afghanistan has been\r\ncompelled to recognize white supremacy as never before. Thus the cycle is\r\nfulfilled, and white political mastery over the brown world is complete.\r\n\r\nPolitical triumphs, however, of themselves guarantee nothing, and the\r\npermanence of the present order of things in the brown world appears more\r\nthan doubtful when we glance beyond the map. The brown world, like the\r\nyellow world, is to-day in acute reaction against white supremacy. In\r\nfact, the brown reaction began a full century ago, and has been gathering\r\nheadway ever since, moved thereto both by its own inherent vitality and by\r\nthe external stimulus of white aggression. The great dynamic of this brown\r\nreaction is the Mohammedan Revival. But before analyzing that movement it\r\nwould be well to glance at the human elements involved.\r\n\r\nFour salient groupings stand out among the brown peoples: India, Iran,\r\n\"Arabistan,\" and \"Turkestan.\" The last two words are used in a special\r\nsense to denote ethnic and cultural aggregations for which no precise\r\nterms have hitherto been coined. India is the population-centre of the\r\nbrown world. More than 300,000,000 souls live within its\r\nborders--two-thirds of all the brown men on earth. India has not, however,\r\nbeen the brown world's spiritual or cultural dynamic, those forces coming\r\nchiefly from the brown lands to the westward. Iran (the Persian plateau)\r\nis comparatively small in area and has less than 15,000,000 inhabitants,\r\nbut its influence upon the brown world has been out of all proportion to\r\nits size and population. \"Arabistan\" denotes the group of peoples, Arab in\r\nblood or Arabized in language and culture, who inhabit the Arabian\r\npeninsula and its adjacent annexes, Syria and Mesopotamia, together with\r\nthe vast band of North Africa lying between the Mediterranean and the\r\nSahara Desert. The total number of these Arabic peoples is 40,000,000,\r\nthree-fourths of them living in North Africa. The term \"Turkestan\" covers\r\nthe group of kindred peoples, often called \"Turanians,\" who stretch from\r\nConstantinople to Central Asia, including the Ottoman Turks of Asia Minor,\r\nthe Tartars of South Russia and Transcaucasia, and the Central Asian\r\nTurkomans. They number in all about 25,000,000. Such are the four\r\noutstanding race-factors in the brown world. Let us now examine that\r\nspiritual factor, Islam, from which the brown renaissance originally\r\nproceeded, and on which most of its present manifestations are based.\r\n\r\nIslam's warlike vigor has impressed men's minds ever since the far-off\r\ndays when its pristine fervor bore the Fiery Crescent from France to\r\nChina. But with the passing cycles this fervor waned, and a century ago\r\nIslam seemed plunged in the stupor of senile decay. The life appeared to\r\nhave gone out of it, leaving naught but the dry husks of empty formalism\r\nand soulless ritual. Yet at this darkest hour a voice came crying from out\r\nthe vast Arabian desert, the cradle of Islam, calling the Faithful to\r\nbetter things. This puritan reformer was the famous Abd-el-Wahab, and his\r\nfollowers, known as Wahabees, soon spread over the length and breadth of\r\nthe Mohammedan world, purging Islam of its sloth and rekindling the fervor\r\nof olden days. Thus began the great Mohammedan Revival.\r\n\r\nThat revival, like all truly regenerative movements, had its political as\r\nwell as its spiritual side. One of the first things which struck the\r\nreformers was the political weakness of the Moslem world and its\r\nincreasing subjection to the Christian West. It was during the early\r\ndecades of the nineteenth century that the revival spread through Islam.\r\nBut this was the very time when Europe, recovering from the losses of the\r\nNapoleonic Wars, began its unparalleled aggressions upon the Moslem East.\r\nThe result in Islam was a fusing of religion and patriotism into a \"sacred\r\nunion\" for the combined spiritual regeneration and political emancipation\r\nof the Moslem world.\r\n\r\nOf course Europe's material and military superiority were then so great\r\nthat speedy success was recognized to be a vain hope. Nevertheless, with\r\ntrue Oriental patience, the reformers were content to work for distant\r\ngoals, and the results of their labors, though hidden from most Europeans,\r\nwas soon discernible to a few keen-sighted white observers. Half a century\r\nago the learned Orientalist Palgrave wrote these prophetic lines: \"Islam\r\nis even now an enormous power, full of self-sustaining vitality, with a\r\nsurplus for aggression; and a struggle with its combined energies would be\r\ndeadly indeed.... The Mohammedan peoples of the East have awakened to the\r\nmanifold strength and skill of their Western Christian rivals; and this\r\nawakening, at first productive of respect and fear, not unmixed with\r\nadmiration, now wears the type of antagonistic dislike, and even of\r\nintelligent hate. No more zealous Moslems are to be found in all the ranks\r\nof Islam than they who have sojourned longest in Europe and acquired the\r\nmost intimate knowledge of its sciences and ways.... Mohammedans are\r\nkeenly alive to the ever-shifting uncertainties and divisions that\r\ndistract the Christianity of to-day, and to the woful instability of\r\nmodern European institutions. From their own point of view, Moslems are as\r\nmen standing on a secure rock, and they contrast the quiet fixity of their\r\nown position with the unsettled and insecure restlessness of all\r\nelse.\"[34]\r\n\r\nThis stability to which Palgrave alludes must not be confused with dead\r\nrigidity. Too many of us still think of the Moslem East as hopelessly\r\npetrified. But those Westerners best acquainted with the Islamic world\r\nassert that nothing could be farther from the truth; emphasizing, on the\r\ncontrary, Islam's present plasticity and rapid assimilation of Western\r\nideas and methods. \"The alleged rigidity of Islam is a European myth,\"[35]\r\nsays Theodore Morison, late principal of the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental\r\nCollege at Aligarh, India; and another Orientalist, Marmaduke Pickthall,\r\nwrites: \"There is nothing in Islam, any more than in Christianity, which\r\nshould halt progress. The fact is that Christianity found, some time ago,\r\na _modus vivendi_ with modern life, while Islam has not yet arrived\r\nthither. But this process is even now being worked out.\"[36]\r\n\r\nThe way in which the Mohammedan world has availed itself of white\r\ninstitutions such as the newspaper in forging its new solidarity is well\r\nportrayed by Bernard Temple. \"It all comes to this, then,\" he writes.\r\n\"World-politics, as viewed by Mohammedanism's political leaders, resolve\r\nthemselves into a struggle--not necessarily a bloody struggle, but still\r\nan intense and vital struggle--for place and power between the three great\r\ndivisions of mankind. The Moslem mind is deeply stirred by the prospect.\r\nEvery Moslem country is in communication with every other Moslem country:\r\ndirectly, by means of special emissaries, pilgrims, travellers, traders,\r\nand postal exchanges; indirectly, by means of Mohammedan newspapers,\r\nbooks, pamphlets, leaflets, and periodicals. I have met with Cairo\r\nnewspapers in Bagdad, Teheran, and Peshawar; Constantinople newspapers in\r\nBasra and Bombay; Calcutta newspapers in Mohammerah, Kerbela, and Port\r\nSaid.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThese European judgments are confirmed by what Asiatics say themselves.\r\nFor example, a Syrian Christian, Ameen Rihani, thus characterizes the\r\npresent strength and vitality of the Moslem world: \"A nation of\r\n250,000,000 souls, more than one-half under Christian rule, struggling to\r\nshake off its fetters; to consolidate its opposing forces; replenishing\r\nitself in the south and in the east from the inexhaustible sources of the\r\nlife primitive; assimilating in the north, but not without discrimination,\r\nthe civilization of Europe; a nation with a glorious past, a living faith\r\nand language, an inspired Book, an undying hope, might be divided against\r\nitself by European diplomacy but can never be subjugated by European\r\narms.... What Islam is losing on the borders of Europe it is gaining in\r\nAfrica and Central Asia through its modern propaganda, which is conducted\r\naccording to Christian methods. And this is one of the grand results of\r\n'civilization by benevolent assimilation.' Europe drills the Moslem to be\r\na soldier who will ultimately turn his weapons against her; and she sends\r\nher missionaries to awaken in the ulema the proselytizing evil.\"[38]\r\n\r\nTypical of Mohammedan literature on this subject are the following\r\nexcerpts from a book published at Cairo in 1907 by an Egyptian, Yahya\r\nSiddyk, significantly entitled \"The Awakening of the Islamic Peoples in\r\nthe Fourteenth Century of the Hegira.\"[39] The book is doubly interesting\r\nbecause the author has a thorough Western education, holding a law degree\r\nfrom the French university of Toulouse, and is a judge on the Egyptian\r\nbench. Although writing as far back as 1907, Yahya Siddyk clearly foresaw\r\nthe imminence of the European War. \"Behold,\" he writes, \"these Great\r\nPowers ruining themselves in terrifying armaments; measuring each other's\r\nstrength with defiant glances; menacing each other; contracting alliances\r\nwhich continually break and which presage those terrible shocks which\r\noverturn the world and cover it with ruins, fire, and blood! The future is\r\nGod's, and nothing is lasting save His Will!\"\r\n\r\nHe considers the white world degenerate. \"Does this mean,\" he asks, \"that\r\nEurope, our 'enlightened guide,' has already reached the summit of its\r\nevolution? Has it already exhausted its vital force by two or three\r\ncenturies of hyper-exertion? In other words: is it already stricken with\r\nsenility, and will it see itself soon obliged to yield its civilizing role\r\nto other peoples less degenerate, less neurasthenic; that is to say,\r\nyounger, more robust, more healthy, than itself? In my opinion, the\r\npresent marks Europe's apogee, and its immoderate colonial expansion\r\nmeans, not strength, but weakness. Despite the aureole of so much\r\ngrandeur, power, and glory, Europe is to-day more divided and more fragile\r\nthan ever, and ill conceals its malaise, its sufferings, and its anguish.\r\nIts destiny is inexorably working out!...\r\n\r\n\"The contact of Europe on the East has caused us both much good and much\r\nevil: good, in the material and intellectual sense; evil, from the moral\r\nand political point of view. Exhausted by long struggles, enervated by a\r\nbrilliant civilization, the Moslem peoples inevitably fell into a malaise,\r\nbut they are not stricken, they are not dead! These peoples, conquered by\r\nthe force of cannon, have not in the least lost their unity, even under\r\nthe oppressive regimes to which the Europeans have long subjected them....\r\nI have said that the European contact has been salutary to us from both\r\nthe material and the intellectual point of view. What reforming Moslem\r\nPrinces wished to impose by force on their Moslem subjects is to-day\r\nrealized a hundredfold. So great has been our progress in the last\r\ntwenty-five years in science, letters, and art that we may well hope to be\r\nin all these things the equals of Europeans in less than half a\r\ncentury....\r\n\r\n\"A new era opens for us with the fourteenth century of the Hegira, and\r\nthis happy century will mark our renaissance and our great future! A new\r\nbreath animates the Mohammedan peoples of all races; all Moslems are\r\npenetrated with the necessity of work and instruction! We all wish to\r\ntravel, do business, tempt fortune, brave dangers. There is in the East,\r\namong the Mohammedans, a surprising activity, an animation, unknown\r\ntwenty-five years ago.... There is to-day a real public opinion throughout\r\nthe East.\"\r\n\r\nThe author concludes: \"Let us hold firm, each for all, and let us hope,\r\nhope, hope! We are fairly launched on the path of progress: let us profit\r\nby it! It is Europe's very tyranny which has wrought our transformation!\r\nIt is our continued contact with Europe which favors our evolution and\r\ninevitably hastens our revival! It is simply History repeating itself; the\r\nWill of God fulfilling itself despite all opposition and all\r\nresistance.... Europe's tutelage over Asiatics is becoming more and more\r\nnominal--the gates of Asia are closing against the European! Surely we\r\nglimpse before us a revolution without parallel in the world's annals. A\r\nnew age is at hand!\"[40]\r\n\r\nIf this be indeed the present spirit of Islam it is a portentous fact, for\r\nits numerical strength is very great. The total number of Mohammedans is\r\nestimated at from 200,000,000 to 250,000,000, and they not only\r\npredominate throughout the brown world with the exception of India, but\r\nthey also count 10,000,000 adherents in China and are gaining prodigiously\r\namong the blacks of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe proselyting power of Islam is extraordinary, and its hold upon its\r\nvotaries is even more remarkable. Throughout history there has been no\r\nsingle instance where a people, once become Moslem, has ever abandoned the\r\nfaith. Extirpated they may have been, like the Moors of Spain, but\r\nextirpation is not apostasy. This extreme tenacity of Islam, this ability\r\nto keep its hold, once it has got a footing, under all circumstances short\r\nof downright extirpation, must be borne in mind when considering the\r\nfuture of regions where Islam is to-day advancing.\r\n\r\nAnd, save in eastern Europe, it is to-day advancing along all its\r\nfar-flung frontiers. Its most signal victories are being won among the\r\nnegro races of central Africa, and this phase will be discussed in the\r\nnext chapter, but elsewhere the same conditions, in lesser degree,\r\nprevail. Every Moslem is a born missionary and instinctively propagates\r\nhis faith among his non-Moslem neighbors. The quality of this missionary\r\ntemper has been well analyzed by Meredith Townsend. \"All the emotions\r\nwhich impel a Christian to proselytize,\" he writes, \"are in a Mussulman\r\nstrengthened by all the motives which impel a political leader and all the\r\nmotives which sway a recruiting sergeant, until proselytism has become a\r\npassion, which, whenever success seems practicable, and especially success\r\non a large scale, develops in the quietest Mussulman a fury of ardor which\r\ninduces him to break down every obstacle, his own strongest prejudices\r\nincluded, rather than stand for an instant in the neophyte's way. He\r\nwelcomes him as a son, and whatever his own lineage, and whether the\r\nconvert be negro, or Chinaman, or Indian, or even European, he will\r\nwithout hesitation or scruple give him his own child in marriage, and\r\nadmit him fully, frankly, and finally into the most exclusive circle in\r\nthe world.\"[41]\r\n\r\nSuch is the vast and growing body of Islam, to-day seeking to weld its\r\nforces into a higher unity for the combined objectives of spiritual\r\nrevival and political emancipation. This unitary movement is known as\r\n\"Pan-Islamism.\" Most Western observers seem to think that Pan-Islamism\r\ncentres in the \"Caliphate,\" and European writers to-day hopefully discuss\r\nwhether the Caliphate's retention by the discredited Turkish Sultans, its\r\ntransferrence to the rulers of the new Arab Hedjaz Kingdom, or its total\r\nsuppression, will best clip Islam's wings.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a very short-sighted and partial view. The Khalifa or\r\n\"Caliph\" (to use the Europeanized form), the Prophet's representative on\r\nearth, has played an important historic role, and the institution is still\r\nvenerated in Islam. But the Pan-Islamic leaders have long been working on\r\na much broader basis. Pan-Islamism's real driving power lies, not in the\r\nCaliphate, but in institutions like the \"Hajj\" or pilgrimage to Mecca, the\r\npropaganda of the \"Habl-ul-Matin\" or \"Tie of True Believers,\" and the\r\ngreat religious fraternities. The Meccan Hajj, where tens of thousands of\r\npicked zealots gather every year from every quarter of the Moslem world,\r\nis really an annual Pan-Islamic congress, where all the interests of the\r\nfaith are discussed at length, and where plans are elaborated for its\r\ndefense and propagation. Similarly ubiquitous is the Pan-Islamic\r\npropaganda of the Habl-ul-Matin, which works tirelessly to compose\r\nsectarian differences and traditional feuds. Lastly, the religious\r\nbrotherhoods cover the Islamic world with a network of far-flung\r\nassociations, quickening the zeal of their myriad members and\r\nco-ordinating their energies for potential action.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of these brotherhoods (though there are others of importance)\r\nis the famous Senussiyah, and its history well illustrates Islam's\r\nevolution during the past hundred years. Its founder, Seyyid Mahommed ben\r\nSenussi, was born in Algeria about the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. He was of high Arab lineage, tracing his descent from Fatima, the\r\ndaughter of the Prophet. In early youth he went to Arabia and there came\r\nunder the influence of the Wahabee movement. In middle life he returned to\r\nAfrica, settling in the Sahara Desert, and there built up the fraternity\r\nwhich bears his name. Before his death the order had spread to all parts\r\nof the Mohammedan world, but it is in northern Africa that it has attained\r\nits peculiar pre-eminence. The Senussi Order is divided into local\r\n\"Zawias\" or lodges, all absolutely dependent upon the Grand Lodge, headed\r\nby The Master, El Senussi. The Grand Mastership still remains in the\r\nfamily, a grandson of the founder being the order's present head. The\r\nSenussi stronghold is an oasis in the very heart of the Sahara. Only one\r\nEuropean eye has ever seen this mysterious spot. Surrounded by absolute\r\ndesert, with wells many leagues apart and the routes of approach known\r\nonly to experienced Senussi guides, every one of whom would suffer a\r\nthousand deaths rather than betray him, El Senussi, The Master, sits\r\nserenely apart, sending his orders throughout North Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Sahara itself is absolutely under Senussi control, while \"Zawias\"\r\nabound in distant regions like Morocco, Lake Chad, and Somaliland. These\r\nlocal Zawias are more than mere \"lodges.\" Their spiritual and secular\r\nheads, the \"Mokaddem\" or priest and the \"Wekil\" or civil governor, have\r\ndiscretionary authority not merely over the Zawia members, but also over\r\nthe community at large--at least, so great is the awe inspired by the\r\nSenussi throughout North Africa that a word from Wekil or Mokaddem is\r\nalways listened to and obeyed. Thus, beside the various European\r\nauthorities, British, French, or Italian as the case may be, there exists\r\nan occult government with which the colonial authorities are careful not\r\nto come into conflict.\r\n\r\nOn their part, the Senussi are equally careful to avoid a downright breach\r\nwith the European Powers. Their long-headed, cautious policy is truly\r\nastonishing. For more than half a century the order has been a great\r\nforce, yet it has never risked the supreme adventure. In all the numerous\r\nfanatic risings against Europeans which have occurred in various parts of\r\nAfrica, local Senussi have undoubtedly taken part, but the order has never\r\nofficially entered the lists.\r\n\r\nThese Fabian tactics as regards open warfare do not mean that the Senussi\r\nare idle. Far from it. On the contrary, they are ceaselessly at work with\r\nthe spiritual arms of teaching, discipline, and conversion. The Senussi\r\nprogramme is the welding, first of Moslem Africa, and later of the whole\r\nMoslem world, into the revived \"Imamat\" of Islam's early days; into a\r\ngreat theocracy, embracing all true believers--in other words,\r\nPan-Islamism. But they believe that the political liberation of Islam from\r\nChristian domination must be preceded by a profound spiritual\r\nregeneration, thereby engendering the moral forces necessary both for the\r\nwar of liberation and for the fruitful reconstruction which should follow\r\nthereafter. This is the secret of the order's extraordinary\r\nself-restraint. This is the reason why, year after year, and decade after\r\ndecade, the Senussi advance slowly, calmly, coldly, gathering great latent\r\npower but avoiding the temptation to expend it one instant before the\r\nproper time. Meanwhile they are covering Africa with their lodges and\r\nschools, disciplining the people to the voice of their Mokaddems and\r\nWekils--and converting millions of pagan negroes to the faith of Islam.\r\n\r\nAnd what is true of the Senussi holds equally for the other wise leaders\r\nwho guide the Pan-Islamic movement. They know both Europe's strength and\r\ntheir own weakness. They know the peril of premature action. Feeling that\r\ntime is on their side, they are content to await the hour when internal\r\nregeneration and external pressure shall have filled to overflowing the\r\ncup of wrath. This is why Islam has offered only local resistance to the\r\nunparalleled white aggressions of the last twenty years. This is the main\r\nreason why there was no real \"Holy War\" in 1914. But the materials for a\r\nHoly War have long been piling high, as a retrospective glance will show.\r\n\r\nEurope's conquests of Africa and Central Asia toward the close of the last\r\ncentury, and the subsequent Anglo-French agreement mutually appropriating\r\nEgypt and Morocco, evoked murmurs of impotent fury from the Moslem world.\r\nUnder such circumstances the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 sent a feverish\r\ntremor throughout Islam. The Japanese might be idolaters, but the\r\ntraditional Moslem loathing of idolaters as beings much lower than\r\nChristians and Jews (recognized by Mohammed as \"Peoples of The Book\") was\r\nquite effaced by the burning sense of subjugation to the Christian yoke.\r\nAccordingly, the Japanese were hailed as heroes throughout Islam. Here we\r\nsee again that tendency toward an understanding between Asiatic and\r\nAfrican races and creeds (in other words, a \"Pan-Colored\" alliance against\r\nwhite domination) which has been so patent in recent years. The way in\r\nwhich Islamic peoples began looking to Japan is revealed by this editorial\r\nin a Persian newspaper, written in the year 1906: \"Desirous of becoming as\r\npowerful as Japan and of safeguarding its national independence, Persia\r\nshould make common cause with it. An alliance becomes necessary. There\r\nshould be a Japanese ambassador at Teheran. Japanese instructors should be\r\nchosen to reorganize the army. Commercial relations should also be\r\ndeveloped.\"[42] Indeed, some pious Moslems hoped to bring this heroic\r\npeople within the Islamic fold. Shortly after the Russo-Japanese War a\r\nChinese Mohammedan sheikh wrote: \"If Japan thinks of becoming some day a\r\nvery great power and making Asia the dominator of the other continents, it\r\nwill be only by adopting the blessed religion of Islam.\"[43] And _Al\r\nMowwayad_, an Egyptian Nationalist journal, remarked: \"England, with her\r\n60,000,000 Indian Moslems, dreads this conversion. With a Mohammedan\r\nJapan, Mussulman policy would change entirely.\"[44] As a matter of fact,\r\nMohammedan missionaries actually went to Japan, where they were smilingly\r\nreceived. Of course the Japanese had not the faintest intention of turning\r\nMoslems, but these spontaneous approaches from the brown world were quite\r\nin line with their ambitious plans, which, as the reader will remember,\r\nwere just then taking concrete shape.\r\n\r\nHowever, it soon became plain that Japan had no present intention of going\r\nso far afield as Western Asia, and Islam presently had to mourn fresh\r\nlosses at Christian hands. In 1911 came Italy's barefaced raid on Turkey's\r\nAfrican dependency of Tripoli. So bitter was the anger in all Mohammedan\r\nlands at this unprovoked aggression that many European observers became\r\nseriously alarmed. \"Why has Italy found 'defenseless' Tripoli such a\r\nhornet's nest?\" queried Gabriel Hanotaux, a former French minister of\r\nforeign affairs. \"It is because she has to do, not merely with Turkey, but\r\nwith Islam as well. Italy has set the ball rolling--so much the worse for\r\nher--and for us all.\"[45] But the Tripoli expedition was only the\r\nbeginning of the Christian assault, for next year came the Balkan War,\r\nwhich sheared away Turkey's European holdings to the walls of\r\nConstantinople and left her crippled and discredited. At these disasters a\r\ncry of wrathful anguish swept the world of Islam from end to end. Here is\r\nhow a leading Indian Moslem interpreted the Balkan conflict:\r\n\r\n\"The King of Greece orders a new crusade. From the London Chancelleries\r\nrise calls to Christian fanaticism, and Saint Petersburg already speaks of\r\nthe planting of the cross on the dome of Sant' Sophia. To-day they speak\r\nthus; to-morrow they will thus speak of Jerusalem and the Mosque of Omar.\r\nBrothers! Be ye of one mind, that it is the duty of every true believer to\r\nhasten beneath the Khalifa's banner and to sacrifice his life for the\r\nsafety of the faith.\"[46] And another Indian Moslem leader thus adjured\r\nthe British authorities: \"I appeal to the present government to change its\r\nanti-Turkish attitude before the fury of millions of Moslem fellow\r\nsubjects is kindled to a blaze and brings disaster.\"[47]\r\n\r\nStill more significant were the appeals made by the Indian Moslems to\r\ntheir Brahman fellow countrymen, the traditionally despised \"Idolaters.\"\r\nThese appeals betokened a veritable revolution in outlook, as can be\r\ngauged from the text of one of them, significantly entitled \"The Message\r\nof the East.\" \"Spirit of the East,\" reads this noteworthy document, \"arise\r\nand repel the swelling flood of Western aggression! Children of Hindustan,\r\naid us with your wisdom, culture, and wealth; lend us your power, the\r\nbirthright and heritage of the Hindu! Let the Spirit Powers hidden in the\r\nHimalayan mountain-peaks arise. Let prayers to the god of battles float\r\nupward; prayers that right may triumph over might; and call to your myriad\r\ngods to annihilate the armies of the foe!\"[48] In China also the same\r\nfraternizing spirit was visible. During the Republican Revolution the\r\nChinese Mohammedans, instead of holding jealously aloof, co-operated\r\nwhole-heartedly with their Buddhist and Confucian fellow citizens, and\r\nDoctor Sun-Yat-Sen, the Republican leader, announced gratefully: \"The\r\nChinese will never forget the assistance which their Moslem compatriots\r\nhave rendered in the interest of order and liberty.\"[49] The Great War\r\nthus found Islam deeply stirred against European aggression, keenly\r\nconscious of its own solidarity, and frankly reaching out for colored\r\nallies in the projected struggle against white domination.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it may at first sight appear strange that no\r\ngeneral Islamic explosion occurred when Turkey entered the lists at the\r\nclose of 1914 and the Sultan-Khalifa issued a formal summons to the Holy\r\nWar. Of course this summons was not the flat failure which Allied reports\r\nled the West to believe at the time. As a matter of fact there was trouble\r\nin practically every Mohammedan land under Allied control. To name only a\r\nfew of many instances: Egypt broke into a tumult smothered only by\r\noverwhelming British reinforcements, Tripoli burst into a flame of\r\ninsurrection that drove the Italians headlong to the coast, Persia was\r\nprevented from joining Turkey only by prompt Russian intervention, and the\r\nIndian Northwest Frontier was the scene of fighting that required the\r\npresence of a quarter of a million Anglo-Indian troops. The British\r\nGovernment has officially admitted that during 1915 the Allies' Asiatic\r\nand African possessions stood within a hand's breadth of a cataclysmic\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nThat insurrection would certainly have taken place if Islam's leaders had\r\neverywhere spoken the fateful word. But the word was not spoken. Instead,\r\ninfluential Moslems outside of Turkey generally condemned the latter's\r\naction and did all in their power to calm the passions of the fanatic\r\nmultitude. The attitude of these leaders does credit to their\r\ndiscernment. They recognized that this was neither the time nor the\r\noccasion for a decisive struggle with the West. They were not yet\r\nmaterially prepared, and they had not perfected their understandings\r\neither among themselves or with their prospective non-Moslem allies. Above\r\nall, the moral urge was lacking. They knew that athwart the Khalifa's writ\r\nwas stencilled \"Made in Germany.\" They knew that the \"Young Turk\" clique\r\nwhich had engineered the coup was made up of Europeanized renegades, many\r\nof them not even nominal Moslems, but atheistic Jews. Far-sighted Moslems\r\nhad no intention of pulling Germany's chestnuts out of the fire, nor did\r\nthey wish to further Prussian schemes of world-dominion which for\r\nthemselves would have meant a mere change of masters. Far better to let\r\nthe white world fight out its desperate feud, weaken itself, and reveal\r\nfully its future intentions. Meanwhile Islam could bide its time, grow in\r\nstrength, and await the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe Versailles Peace Conference was just such a revelation of European\r\nintentions as the Pan-Islamic leaders had been awaiting in order to\r\nperfect their programmes and enlist the moral solidarity of their peoples.\r\nAt Versailles the European Powers showed unequivocally that they had no\r\nintention of relaxing their hold upon the Near and Middle East. By a\r\nnumber of secret treaties negotiated during the war the Ottoman Empire had\r\nbeen virtually partitioned between the victorious Allies, and these secret\r\ntreaties formed the basis of the Versailles settlement. Furthermore,\r\nEgypt had been declared a British protectorate at the very beginning of\r\nthe European struggle, while the Versailles Conference had scarcely\r\nadjourned before England announced an \"agreement\" with Persia which made\r\nthat country another British protectorate, in fact, if not in name. The\r\nupshot was, as already stated, that the Near and Middle East were\r\nsubjected to European political domination as never before.\r\n\r\nBut there was another side to the shield. During the war years the Allied\r\nstatesmen had officially proclaimed times without number that the war was\r\nbeing fought to establish a new world-order based on such principles as\r\nthe rights of small nations and the liberty of all peoples. These\r\npronouncements had been treasured and memorized throughout the East. When,\r\ntherefore, the East saw a peace settlement based, not upon these high\r\nprofessions, but upon the imperialistic secret treaties, it was fired with\r\na moral indignation and sense of outraged justice never known before. A\r\ntide of impassioned determination began rising which has already set the\r\nentire East in tumultuous ferment, and which seems merely the premonitory\r\nground-swell of a greater storm. Many European students of Eastern affairs\r\nare gravely alarmed at the prospect. Here, for example, is the judgment of\r\nLeone Caetani, Duke of Sermoneta, an Italian authority on Oriental and\r\nMohammedan questions. Speaking in the spring of 1919 on the war's effect\r\non the East, he said: \"The convulsion has shaken Islamitic and Oriental\r\ncivilization to its foundations. The entire Oriental world, from China to\r\nthe Mediterranean, is in ferment. Everywhere the hidden fire of\r\nanti-European hatred is burning. Riots in Morocco, risings in Algiers,\r\ndiscontent in Tripoli, so-called Nationalist attempts in Egypt, Arabia,\r\nand Lybia, are all different manifestations of the same deep sentiment,\r\nand have as their object the rebellion of the Oriental world against\r\nEuropean civilization.\"[50]\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs in Egypt is a typical illustration of what has been\r\ngoing on in the East ever since the close of the late war. Egypt was\r\noccupied by England in 1882, and British rule has conferred immense\r\nmaterial benefits, raising the country from anarchic bankruptcy to ordered\r\nprosperity. Yet British rule was never really popular, and as the years\r\npassed a \"Nationalist\" movement steadily grew in strength, having for its\r\nslogan the phrase \"Egypt for the Egyptians,\" and demanding Britain's\r\ncomplete evacuation of the country. This demand Great Britain refused even\r\nto consider. Practically all Englishmen are agreed that Egypt with the\r\nSuez Canal is the vital link between the eastern and western halves of the\r\nBritish Empire, and they therefore consider the permanent occupation of\r\nEgypt an absolute necessity. There is thus a clear deadlock between\r\nBritish imperial and Egyptian national convictions.\r\n\r\nSome years before the war Egypt became so unruly that England was obliged\r\nto abandon all thoughts of conciliation and initiated a regime of frank\r\nrepression enforced by Lord Kitchener's heavy hand. The European War and\r\nTurkey's adhesion to the Teutonic Powers caused fresh outbreaks in Egypt,\r\nbut these were quickly repressed and England took advantage of Ottoman\r\nbelligerency to abolish the fiction of Turkish overlordship and declare\r\nEgypt a protectorate of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nDuring the war Egypt, flooded with British troops, remained quiet, but the\r\nend of the war gave the signal for an unparalleled outburst of Nationalist\r\nactivity. Basing their claims on such doctrines as the \"rights of small\r\nnations\" and the \"self-determination of peoples,\" the Nationalists\r\ndemanded immediate independence and attempted to get Egypt's case before\r\nthe Versailles Peace Conference. In defiance of English prohibitions, they\r\neven held a popular plebiscite which upheld their claims. When the British\r\nauthorities answered this defiance by arresting Nationalist leaders, Egypt\r\nflamed into rebellion from end to end. Everywhere it was the same story.\r\nRailways and telegraph lines were systematically cut. Trains were stalled\r\nand looted. Isolated British officers and soldiers were murdered. In Cairo\r\nalone, thousands of houses were sacked by the mob. Soon the danger was\r\nrendered more acute by the irruption out of the desert of swarms of\r\nBedouin Arabs bent on plunder. For a few days Egypt trembled on the verge\r\nof anarchy, and the British Government admitted in Parliament that all\r\nEgypt was in a state of insurrection.\r\n\r\nThe British authorities, however, met the crisis with vigor and\r\ndetermination. The number of British troops in Egypt was very large,\r\ntrusty black regiments were hurried up from the Sudan, and the\r\nwell-disciplined Egyptian native police generally obeyed orders. The\r\nresult was that after several weeks of sharp fighting, lasting through the\r\nspring of 1919, Egypt was again gotten under control. The outlook for the\r\nfuture is, however, ominous in the extreme. Order is indeed restored, but\r\nonly the presence of massed British and Sudanese black troops guarantees\r\nthat order will be maintained. Even under the present regime of stern\r\nmartial law hardly a month passes without fresh rioting and heavy loss of\r\nlife. Egypt appears Nationalist to the core, its spokesmen swear they will\r\naccept nothing short of independence, and in the long run Britain will\r\nrealize the truth of that pithy saying: \"You can do everything with\r\nbayonets except sit on them.\"\r\n\r\nIndia is likewise in a state of profound unrest. The vast peninsula has\r\nbeen controlled by England for almost two centuries, yet here again the\r\nlast two decades have witnessed a rapidly increasing movement against\r\nBritish rule. This movement was at first confined to the upper-class\r\nHindus, the great Mohammedan element preserving its traditional loyalty to\r\nthe British \"Raj,\" which it considered a protection against the\r\nBrahmanistic Hindu majority. But, as already seen, the Pan-Islamic leaven\r\npresently reached the Indian Moslems, European aggressions on Islam\r\nstirred their resentment, and at length Moslem and Hindu adjourned their\r\nancient feud in their new solidarity against European tutelage.\r\n\r\nThe Great War provoked relatively little sedition in India. Groups of\r\nHindu extremists, to be sure, hatched terroristic plots and welcomed\r\nGerman aid, but India as a whole backed England and helped win the war\r\nwith both money and men. At the same time, Indians gave notice that they\r\nexpected their loyalty to be rewarded, and at the close of the war various\r\nmemorials were drawn up calling for drastic modifications of the existing\r\ngovernmental regime.\r\n\r\nIndia is to-day governed by an English Civil Service whose fairness,\r\nhonesty, and general efficiency no informed person can seriously impugn.\r\nBut this no longer contents Indian aspirations. India desires not merely\r\ngood government but self-government. The ultimate goal of all Indian\r\nreformers is emancipation from European tutelage, though they differ among\r\nthemselves as to how and when this emancipation is to be attained. The\r\nmost conservative would be content with self-government under British\r\nguidance, the middle group asks for the full status of a Dominion of the\r\nBritish Empire like Canada and Australia, while the radicals demand\r\ncomplete independence. Even the most conservative of these demands would,\r\nhowever, involve great changes of system and a diminution of British\r\ncontrol. Such demands arouse in England mistrust and apprehension.\r\nEnglishmen point out that India is not a nation but a congeries of\r\ndiverse peoples spiritually sundered by barriers of blood, language,\r\nculture, and religion, and they conclude that, if England's control were\r\nreally relaxed, India would get out of hand and drift toward anarchy. As\r\nfor Indian independence, the average Englishman cannot abide the thought,\r\nholding it fatal both for the British Empire and for India itself. The\r\nresult has been that England has failed to meet Indian demands, and this,\r\nin turn, has roused an acute recrudescence of dissatisfaction and unrest.\r\nThe British Government has countered with coercive legislation like the\r\nRowlatt Acts and has sternly repressed rioting and terrorism. British\r\nauthority is still supreme in India. But it is an authority resting more\r\nand more upon force. In fact, some Englishmen have long considered British\r\nrule in India, despite its imposing appearance, a decidedly fragile\r\naffair. Many years ago Meredith Townsend, who certainly knew India well,\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\"The English think they will rule India for many centuries or forever. I\r\ndo not think so, holding rather the older belief that the empire which\r\ncame in a day will disappear in a night.... Above all this inconceivable\r\nmass of humanity, governing all, protecting all, taxing all, rises what we\r\ncall here 'the Empire,' a corporation of less than 1,500 men, partly\r\nchosen by examination, partly by co-optation, who are set to govern, and\r\nwho protect themselves in governing by finding pay for a minute white\r\ngarrison of 65,000 men, one-fifth of the Roman legions--though the masses\r\nto be controlled are double the subjects of Rome. That corporation and\r\nthat garrison constitute the 'Indian Empire.' There is nothing else.\r\nBanish those 1,500 men in black, defeat that slender garrison in red, and\r\nthe empire has ended, the structure disappears, and brown India emerges,\r\nunchanged and unchangeable. To support the official world and its\r\ngarrison--both, recollect, smaller than those of Belgium--there is, except\r\nIndian opinion, absolutely nothing. Not only is there no white race in\r\nIndia, not only is there no white colony, but there is no white man who\r\npurposes to remain.... There are no white servants, not even grooms, no\r\nwhite policemen, no white postmen, no white anything. If the brown men\r\nstruck for a week, the 'Empire' would collapse like a house of cards, and\r\nevery ruling man would be a starving prisoner in his own house. He could\r\nnot move or feed himself or get water.\"[51]\r\n\r\nThese words aptly illustrate the truth stated at the beginning of this\r\nbook that the basic factor in human affairs is not politics but race, and\r\nthat the most imposing political phenomena, of themselves, mean nothing.\r\nAnd that is just the fatal weakness underlying the white man's present\r\npolitical domination over the brown world. Throughout that entire world\r\nthere is no settled white population save in the French colonies of\r\nAlgeria and Tunis along the Mediterranean seaboard, where whites form\r\nperhaps one-sixth of the total. Elsewhere, from Morocco to the Dutch\r\nIndies, there is in the racial sense, as Townsend well says, \"no white\r\nanything,\" and if white rule vanished to-morrow it would not leave a human\r\ntrace behind. White rule is therefore purely political, based on\r\nprescription, prestige, and lack of effective opposition. These are indeed\r\nfragile foundations. Let the brown world once make up its mind that the\r\nwhite man _must_ go, and he _will_ go, for his position will have become\r\nsimply impossible. It is not solely a question of a \"Holy War\"; mere\r\npassive resistance, if genuine and general, would shake white rule to its\r\nfoundations. And it is precisely the determination to get rid of white\r\nrule which seems to be spreading like wild-fire over the brown world\r\nto-day. The unrest which I have described in Egypt and India merely typify\r\nwhat is going on in Morocco, Central Asia, the Dutch Indies, the\r\nPhilippines, and every other portion of the brown world whose inhabitants\r\nare above the grade of savages.\r\n\r\nAnother factor favoring the prospects of brown emancipation is the lack of\r\nsustained resistance which the white world would probably offer. For the\r\nwhite world's interests in these regions, though great, are not\r\nfundamental; that is to say, racial. However grievously they might suffer\r\npolitically and economically, racially the white peoples would lose almost\r\nnothing. Here again we see the basic importance of race in human affairs.\r\nContrast, for example, England's attitude toward an insurgent India with\r\nFrance's attitude toward an insurgent North Africa. England, with nothing\r\nracial at stake, would hesitate before a reconquest of India involving\r\nmillions of soldiers and billions of treasure. France, on the other hand,\r\nwith nearly a million Europeans in her North African possessions, half of\r\nthese full-blooded Frenchmen, might risk her last franc and her last\r\n_poilu_ rather than see these blood-brothers slaughtered and enslaved.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, what to-day seems probable, that white political control\r\nover the brown world is destined to be sensibly curtailed if not generally\r\neliminated, what are the larger racial implications? Above all: will the\r\nbrowns tend to impinge on white race-areas as the yellows show signs of\r\ndoing? Probably, no; at least, not to any great extent. In the first\r\nplace, the brown world has within its present confines plenty of room for\r\npotential race-expansion. Outside India, Egypt, Java, and a few lesser\r\nspots, there is scarcely a brown land where natural improvements such as\r\nirrigation would not open up extensive settlement areas. Mesopotamia\r\nalone, now almost uninhabited, might support a vast population, while\r\nPersia could nourish several times its present inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIndia, to be sure, is almost as congested as China, and the spectre of the\r\nIndian coolie has lately alarmed white lands like Canada and South Africa\r\nalmost as much as the Chinese coolie has done. But an independent India\r\nwould fall under the same political blight as the rest of the brown\r\nworld--the blight of internecine dissensions and wars. The brown world's\r\npresent growing solidarity is not a positive but a negative phenomenon. It\r\nis an alliance, against a common foe, of traditional enemies who, once the\r\nbond was loosed in victory, would inevitably quarrel among themselves.\r\nTurk would fly at Arab and Turkoman at Persian, as of yore, while India\r\nwould become a welter of contending Hindus, Moslems, Sikhs, Gurkhas, and\r\nheaven knows what, until perchance disciplined anew by the pressure of a\r\nYellow Peril. In Western Asia it is possible that the spiritual and\r\ncultural bonds of Islam might temper these struggles, but Western Asia is\r\nprecisely that part of the brown world where population-pressure is\r\nabsent. India, the overpeopled brown land, would undergo such a cycle of\r\nstrife as would devour its human surplus and render distant aggressions\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nA potential brown menace to white race-areas would, indeed, arise in case\r\nof a brown-yellow alliance against the white peoples. But such an alliance\r\ncould occur only in the first stages of a pan-colored war of liberation\r\nwhile the pressure of white world-predominance was still keenly felt and\r\nbefore the divisive tendencies within the brown world had begun to take\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nShort of such an alliance (wherein the browns would abet the yellows'\r\naggressive, racial objectives in return for yellow support of their own\r\nessentially defensive, political ends), the brown world's emancipation\r\nfrom white domination would apparently not result in more than local\r\npressures on white race-areas. It would, however, affect another sphere of\r\nwhite political control--black Africa. The emancipation of brown, Islamic\r\nNorth Africa would inevitably send a sympathetic thrill through every\r\nportion of the Dark Continent and would stir both Mohammedan and pagan\r\nnegroes against white rule. Islam is, in fact, the intimate link between\r\nthe brown and black worlds. But this subject, with its momentous\r\nimplications, will be discussed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBLACK MAN'S LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack Man's Land is primarily Africa south of the Sahara Desert. Here\r\ndwell the bulk of all the 150,000,000 black men on earth. The negro and\r\nnegroid population of Africa is estimated at about\r\n120,000,000--four-fifths of the black race-total. Besides its African\r\nnucleus the black race has two distant outposts: the one in Australasia,\r\nthe other in the Americas. The Eastern blacks are found mainly in the\r\narchipelagoes lying between the Asiatic land-mass and Australia. They are\r\nthe Oriental survivors of the black belt which in very ancient times\r\nstretched uninterruptedly from Africa across southern Asia to the Pacific\r\nOcean. The Asiatic blacks were overwhelmed by other races ages ago, and\r\nonly a few wild tribes like the \"Negritos\" of the Philippines and the\r\njungle-dwellers of Indo-China and southern India survive as genuine\r\nnegroid stocks. All the peoples of southern Asia, however, are darkened by\r\nthis ancient negroid strain. The peoples of south India are notably tinged\r\nwith black blood. As for the pure blacks of the Australasian\r\narchipelagoes, they are so few in numbers (about 3,000,000) and so low in\r\ntype that they are of negligible importance. Quite otherwise are the\r\nblacks of the Far West. In the western hemisphere there are some\r\n25,000,000 persons of more or less mixed black blood, brought thither in\r\nmodern times as slaves by the white conquerors of the New World. Still,\r\nwhatever may be the destiny of these transplanted black folk, the black\r\nman's chief significance, from the world aspect, must remain bound up with\r\nthe great nucleus of negro population in the African homeland.\r\n\r\nBlack Africa, as I have said, lies south of the Sahara Desert. Here the\r\nnegro has dwelt for unnumbered ages. The key-note of black history, like\r\nyellow history, has been isolation. Cut off from the Mediterranean by the\r\ndesert which he had no means of crossing, and bounded elsewhere by oceans\r\nwhich he had no skill in navigating, the black man vegetated in savage\r\nobscurity, his habitat being well named the \"Dark Continent.\"\r\n\r\nUntil the white tide began breaking on its sea-fronts four centuries ago,\r\nthe black world's only external stimuli had come from brown men landing on\r\nits eastern coasts or ascending the valley of the Nile. As time passed,\r\nboth brown and white pressures became more intense, albeit the browns long\r\nled in the process of penetration. Advancing from the east and trickling\r\nacross the desert from the north, Arab or Arabized adventurers conquered\r\nblack Africa to the equator; and this political subjugation had also a\r\nracial side, for the conquerors sowed their blood freely and set a\r\nbrownish stamp on many regions. As for the whites, they long remained mere\r\nbirds of passage. Half a century ago they possessed little more than\r\ntrading-posts along the littorals, their only real settlement lying in the\r\nextreme south.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, all was changed. In the closing decades of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, Europe turned its gaze full upon the Dark Continent, and within a\r\ngeneration Africa was partitioned between the European Powers. Negro and\r\nArab alike fell under European domination. Only minute Liberia and remote\r\nAbyssinia retained a qualified independence. Furthermore, white settlement\r\nalso made distinct progress. The tropical bulk of Africa defied white\r\ncolonization, but the continent's northern and southern extremities were\r\nclimatically \"white man's country.\" Accordingly, there are to-day nearly a\r\nmillion whites settled along the Algerian and Tunisian seaboard, while in\r\nSouth Africa, Dutch and British blood has built up a powerful commonwealth\r\ncontaining fully one and one-half million white souls. In Africa, unlike\r\nAsia, the European has taken root, and has thus gained at least local\r\ntenures of a fundamental nature.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the African problem therefore resolves itself into the\r\nquestion whether the white man, through consolidated racial holds north\r\nand south, will be able to perpetuate his present political control over\r\nthe intermediate continental mass which climate debars him from\r\npopulating. This is a matter of great importance, for Africa is a land of\r\nenormous potential wealth, the natural source of Europe's tropical raw\r\nmaterials and foodstuffs. Whether Europe is to retain possession depends,\r\nin the last analysis, on the character of the inhabitants. It is, then,\r\nto the nature of the black man and his connection with the brown world\r\nthat we must direct our attention.\r\n\r\nFrom the first glance we see that, in the negro, we are in the presence of\r\na being differing profoundly not merely from the white man but also from\r\nthose human types which we discovered in our surveys of the brown and\r\nyellow worlds. The black man is, indeed, sharply differentiated from the\r\nother branches of mankind. His outstanding quality is superabundant animal\r\nvitality. In this he easily surpasses all other races. To it he owes his\r\nintense emotionalism. To it, again, is due his extreme fecundity, the\r\nnegro being the quickest of breeders. This abounding vitality shows in\r\nmany other ways, such as the negro's ability to survive harsh conditions\r\nof slavery under which other races have soon succumbed. Lastly, in ethnic\r\ncrossings, the negro strikingly displays his prepotency, for black blood,\r\nonce entering a human stock, seems never really bred out again.\r\n\r\nNegro fecundity is a prime factor in Africa's future. In the savage state\r\nwhich until recently prevailed, black multiplication was kept down by a\r\nwide variety of checks. Both natural and social causes combined to\r\nmaintain an extremely high death-rate. The negro's political ineptitude,\r\nnever rising above the tribal concept, kept black Africa a mosaic of\r\npeoples, warring savagely among themselves and widely addicted to\r\ncannibalism. Then, too, the native religions were usually sanguinary,\r\ndemanding a prodigality of human sacrifices. The killings ordained by\r\nnegro wizards and witch-doctors sometimes attained unbelievable\r\nproportions. The combined result of all this was a wastage of life which\r\nin other races would have spelled a declining population. Since the\r\nestablishment of white political control, however, these checks on black\r\nfecundity are no longer operative. The white rulers fight filth and\r\ndisease, stop tribal wars, and stamp out superstitious abominations. In\r\nconsequence, population increases by leaps and bounds, the latent\r\npossibilities being shown in the native reservations in South Africa,\r\nwhere tribes have increased as much as tenfold in fifty or sixty years. It\r\nis therefore practically certain that the African negroes will multiply\r\nprodigiously in the next few decades.\r\n\r\nNow, what will be the attitude of these augmenting black masses toward\r\nwhite political dominion? To that momentous query no certain answer can be\r\nmade. One thing, however, seems clear: the black world's reaction to white\r\nascendancy will be markedly different from those of the brown and yellow\r\nworlds, because of the profound dissimilarities between negroes and men of\r\nother stocks. To begin with, the black peoples have no historic pasts.\r\nNever having evolved civilizations of their own, they are practically\r\ndevoid of that accumulated mass of beliefs, thoughts, and experiences\r\nwhich render Asiatics so, impenetrable and so hostile to white influences.\r\nAlthough the white race displays sustained constructive power to an\r\nunrivalled degree, particularly in its Nordic branches, the brown and\r\nyellow peoples have contributed greatly to the civilization of the world\r\nand have profoundly influenced human progress. The negro, on the contrary,\r\nhas contributed virtually nothing. Left to himself, he remained a savage,\r\nand in the past his only quickening has been where brown men have imposed\r\ntheir ideas and altered his blood. The originating powers of the European\r\nand the Asiatic are not in him.\r\n\r\nThis lack of constructive originality, however, renders the negro\r\nextremely susceptible to external influences. The Asiatic, conscious of\r\nhis past and his potentialities, is chary of foreign innovations and\r\nrefuses to recognize alien superiority. The negro, having no past,\r\nwelcomes novelty and tacitly admits that others are his masters. Both\r\nbrown and white men have been so accepted in Africa. The relatively faint\r\nresistance offered by the naturally brave blacks to white and brown\r\nconquest, the ready reception of Christianity and Islam, and the\r\nextraordinary personal ascendancy acquired by individual Arabs and\r\nEuropeans, all indicate a willingness to accept foreign tutelage which in\r\nthe Asiatic is wholly absent.\r\n\r\nThe Arab and the European are, in fact, rivals for the mastership of black\r\nAfrica. The Arab had a long start, but the European suddenly overtook him\r\nand brought not only the blacks but the African Arabs themselves under his\r\nsway. It remains to be seen whether the Arab, allying himself with the\r\nblacks, can oust his white rival. That some such move will be attempted,\r\nin view of the brown world's renaissance in general and the extraordinary\r\nactivity of the Arab peoples in particular, seems a foregone conclusion.\r\nHow the matter will work out depends on three things: (1) the brown man's\r\ninherent strength in Africa; (2) the possibilities of black disaffection\r\nagainst white tutelage; (3) the white man's strength and power of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nThe seat of brown power in Africa is of course the great belt of territory\r\nnorth of the Sahara. From Egypt to Morocco the inhabitants are Arabized in\r\nculture and Mohammedan in faith, while Arab blood has percolated ever\r\nsince the Moslem conquest twelve centuries ago. In the eastern half of\r\nthis zone Arabization has been complete, and Egypt, Tripoli, and the Sudan\r\ncan be considered as unalterably wedded to the brown Islamic world. The\r\nzone's western half, however, is in different case. The majority of its\r\ninhabitants are Berbers, an ancient stock generally considered white, with\r\nclose affinities to the Latin peoples across the Mediterranean. As usual,\r\nblood tells. The Berbers have been under Arab tutelage for over a thousand\r\nyears, yet their whole manner of life remains distinct, they have largely\r\nkept their language, and there has been comparatively little\r\nintermarriage. Pure-blooded Arabs abound, but they are still, in a way,\r\nforeigners. To-day the entire region is under white, French, rule.\r\nAlgeria, in particular, has been politically French for almost a hundred\r\nyears. Europeans have come in and number nearly a million souls. The Arab\r\nelement shows itself sullen and refractory, but the Berbers display much\r\nless aversion to French rule, which, as usual, is considerate of native\r\nsusceptibilities. The French colonial authorities are alive to the\r\nBerber's ethnic affinities and tactfully seek to stimulate his dormant\r\nwhite consciousness. In Algeria intermarriage between Europeans and\r\nBerbers has actually begun. Of course the process is merely in its first\r\nstages. Still, the blood is there, the leaven is working, and in time\r\nNorthwest Africa may return to the white world, where it was in Roman days\r\nand where it racially belongs. In the anti-European disturbances now\r\ntaking place in Algeria and Tunis it is safe to say that the Arab element\r\nis making most of the trouble.\r\n\r\nIt is Northeast Africa, then, which is the real nucleus of Arabism. Here\r\nArabism and Islam rule unchecked, and in the preceding chapter we saw how\r\nthe Senussi Order was marshalling the fierce nomads of the desert. These\r\ntribesmen are relatively few in numbers, but more splendid fighting\r\nmaterial does not exist in the wide world. Furthermore, the Arab-negroid\r\npeoples which have developed along the southern edge of the desert so\r\nblend the martial qualities of both strains that they frequently display\r\nan almost demoniacal fighting-power. It is Pan-Islamism's hope to use\r\nthese Arab or Arabized fanatics as an officers' corps for the black\r\nmillions whom it is converting to the faith.\r\n\r\nConcerning Islam's steady progress in black Africa there can be no shadow\r\nof a doubt. Every candid European observer tells the same story.\r\n\"Mohammedanism,\" says Sir Charles Elliott, \"can still give the natives a\r\nmotive for animosity against Europeans and a unity of which they are\r\notherwise incapable.\"[52] Twenty years ago another English observer, T. R.\r\nThrelfall, wrote: \"Mohammedanism is making marvellous progress in the\r\ninterior of Africa. It is crushing paganism out. Against it the Christian\r\npropaganda is a myth.... The rapid spread of militant Mohammedanism among\r\nthe savage tribes to the north of the equator is a serious factor in the\r\nfight for racial supremacy in Africa. With very few exceptions the colored\r\nraces of Africa are pre-eminently fighters. To them the law of the\r\nstronger is supreme; they have been conquered, and in turn they conquered.\r\nTo them the fierce, warlike spirit inherent in Mohammedanism is infinitely\r\nmore attractive than is the gentle, peace-loving, high moral standard of\r\nChristianity: hence, the rapid headway the former is making in central\r\nAfrica, and the certainty that it will soon spread to the south of the\r\nZambezi.\"[53]\r\n\r\nThe way in which Islam is marching southward is dramatically shown by a\r\nrecent incident. A few years ago the British authorities suddenly\r\ndiscovered that Mohammedanism was pervading Nyassaland. An investigation\r\nbrought out the fact that it was the work of Zanzibar Arabs. They began\r\ntheir propaganda about 1900. Ten years later almost every village in\r\nsouthern Nyassaland had its Moslem teacher and its mosque-hut. Although\r\nthe movement was frankly anti-European, the British authorities did not\r\ndare to check it for fear of repercussions elsewhere. Another interesting\r\nfact, probably not unconnected, is that Nyassaland has lately been the\r\ntheatre of an anti-white \"Christian\" propaganda--the so-called \"Ethiopian\r\nChurch,\" of which I shall presently speak.\r\n\r\nIslam has thus two avenues of approach to the African negro--his natural\r\npreference for a militant faith and his resentment at white tutelage. It\r\nis the disinclination of the more martial African peoples for a pacific\r\ncreed which perhaps accounts for Christianity's slow progress among the\r\nvery warlike tribes of South Africa, such as the Zulus and the Matabele.\r\nIslam is as yet unknown south of the Zambezi, but white men universally\r\ndread the possibility of its appearance, fearing its effect upon the\r\nnatives. Of course Christianity has made distinct progress in the Dark\r\nContinent. The natives of the South African Union are predominantly\r\nChristianized. In east-central Africa Christianity has also gained many\r\nconverts, particularly in Uganda, while on the West African Guinea coast\r\nChristian missions have long been established and have generally succeeded\r\nin keeping Islam away from the seaboard. Certainly, all white men, whether\r\nprofessing Christians or not, should welcome the success of missionary\r\nefforts in Africa. The degrading fetishism and demonology which sum up the\r\nnative pagan cults cannot stand, and all negroes will some day be either\r\nChristians or Moslems. In so far as he is Christianized, the negro's\r\nsavage instincts will be restrained and he will be disposed to acquiesce\r\nin white tutelage. In so far as he is Islamized, the negro's warlike\r\npropensities will be inflamed, and he will be used as the tool of Arab\r\nPan-Islamism seeking to drive the white man from Africa and make the\r\ncontinent its very own.\r\n\r\nAs to specific anti-white sentiments among negroes untouched by Moslem\r\npropaganda, such sentiments undoubtedly exist in many quarters. The\r\nstrongest manifestations are in South Africa, where interracial relations\r\nare bad and becoming worse, but there is much diffused, half-articulate\r\ndislike of white men throughout central Africa as well. Devoid though the\r\nAfrican savage is of either national or cultural consciousness, he could\r\nnot be expected to welcome a tutelage which imposed many irksome\r\nrestrictions upon him. Furthermore, the African negro does seem to possess\r\na certain rudimentary sense of race-solidarity. The existence of both\r\nthese sentiments is proved by the way in which the news of white military\r\nreverses have at once been known and rejoiced in all over black Africa;\r\nspread, it would seem, by those mysterious methods of communication\r\nemployed by negroes everywhere and called in our Southern States\r\n\"grape-vine telegraph.\" The Russo-Japanese War, for example, produced all\r\nover the Dark Continent intensely exciting effects.\r\n\r\nThis generalized anti-white feeling has, during the past decade, taken\r\ntangible form in South Africa. The white population of the Union, though\r\nnumbering 1,500,000, is surrounded by a black population four times as\r\ngreat and increasing more rapidly, while in many sections the whites are\r\noutnumbered ten to one. The result is a state of affairs exactly\r\nparalleling conditions in our own South, the South African whites feeling\r\nobliged to protect their ascendancy by elaborate legal regulations and\r\nsocial taboos. The negroes have been rapidly growing more restive under\r\nthese discriminations, and unpleasant episodes like race-riots, rapings,\r\nand lynchings are increasing in South Africa from year to year.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant, not to say ominous, signs of the times is the\r\n\"Ethiopian Church\" movement. The movement began about fifteen years ago,\r\nsome of its founders being Afro-American Methodist preachers--a fact which\r\nthrows a curious light on possible American negro reflexes upon their\r\nancestral homeland. The movement spread rapidly, many native mission\r\ncongregations cutting loose from white ecclesiastical control and joining\r\nthe negro organization. It also soon displayed frankly anti-white\r\ntendencies, and the government became seriously alarmed at its unsettling\r\ninfluence upon the native mind. It was suspected of having had a hand in\r\nthe Zulu rising which broke out in Natal in 1907 and which was put down\r\nonly after many whites and thousands of natives had lost their lives.\r\nShortly afterward the authorities outlawed the Ethiopian Church and\r\nforbade Afro-American preachers to enter South Africa, but the movement,\r\nthough legally suppressed, lived surreptitiously on and appeared in new\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 a peculiarly fanatical form of Ethiopianism broke out in\r\nNyassaland. Its leader was a certain John Chilembwe, an Ethiopian preacher\r\nwho had been educated in the United States. His propaganda was bitterly\r\nanti-white, asserting that Africa belonged to the black man, that the\r\nwhite man was an intruder, and that he ought to be killed off until he\r\ngrew discouraged and abandoned the country. Chilembwe plotted a rising all\r\nover Nyassaland, the killing of the white men, and the carrying off of the\r\nwhite women. In January, 1915, the rising took place. Some plantations\r\nwere sacked and several whites killed, their heads being carried to\r\nChilembwe's \"church,\" where a thanksgiving service for victory was held.\r\nThe whites, however, acted with great vigor, the poorly armed insurgents\r\nwere quickly scattered, and John Chilembwe himself was soon hunted down\r\nand killed. In itself, the incident was of slight importance, but, taken\r\nin connection with much else, it does not augur well for the future.[54]\r\n\r\nAn interesting indication of the growing sense of negro race-solidarity\r\nwas the \"Pan-African Congress\" held at Paris early in 1919. Here delegates\r\nfrom black communities throughout the world gathered to discuss matters of\r\ncommon interest. Most of the delegates were from Africa and the Americas,\r\nbut one delegate from New Guinea was also present, thus representing the\r\nAustralasian branch of the black race. The Congress was not largely\r\nattended and was of a somewhat provisional character, but arrangements for\r\nthe holding of subsequent congresses were made.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the African problem's present status: To begin with, we\r\nhave a rapidly growing black population, increasingly restive under white\r\ntutelage and continually excited by Pan-Islamic propaganda with the\r\nfurther complication of another anti-white propaganda spread by negro\r\nradicals from America.\r\n\r\nThe African situation is thus somewhat analogous to conditions in Asia.\r\nBut the analogy must not be pressed too far. In Asia white hegemony rests\r\nsolely on political bases, while the Asiatics themselves, browns and\r\nyellows alike, display constructive power and possess civilizations built\r\nup by their own efforts from the remote past. The Asiatics are to-day once\r\nmore displaying their innate capacity by not merely adopting, but\r\nadapting, white ideas and methods. We behold an Asiatic _renaissance_,\r\nwhose genuineness is best attested by the fact that there have been\r\nsimilar movements in past times.\r\n\r\nNone of this applies to Africa. The black race has never shown real\r\nconstructive power. It has never built up a native civilization. Such\r\nprogress as certain negro groups have made has been due to external\r\npressure and has never long outlived that pressure's removal, for the\r\nnegro, when left to himself, as in Haiti and Liberia, rapidly reverts to\r\nhis ancestral ways. The negro is a facile, even eager, imitator; but\r\nthere he stops. He adopts; but he does not adapt, assimilate, and give\r\nforth creatively again.\r\n\r\nThe whole of history testifies to this truth. As the Englishman Meredith\r\nTownsend says: \"None of the black races, whether negro or Australian, have\r\nshown within the historic time the capacity to develop civilization. They\r\nhave never passed the boundaries of their own habitats as conquerors, and\r\nnever exercised the smallest influence over peoples not black. They have\r\nnever founded a stone city, have never built a ship, have never produced a\r\nliterature, have never suggested a creed.... There seems to be no reason\r\nfor this except race. It is said that the negro has been buried in the\r\nmost 'massive' of the four continents, and has been, so to speak, lost to\r\nhumanity; but he was always on the Nile, the immediate road to the\r\nMediterranean, and in West and East Africa he was on the sea. Africa is\r\nprobably more fertile, and almost certainly richer than Asia, and is\r\npierced by rivers as mighty, and some of them at least as navigable. What\r\ncould a singularly healthy race, armed with a constitution which resists\r\nthe sun and defies malaria, wish for better than to be seated on the Nile,\r\nor the Congo, or the Niger, in numbers amply sufficient to execute any\r\nneeded work, from the cutting of forests and the making of roads up to the\r\nbuilding of cities? How was the negro more secluded than the Peruvian; or\r\nwhy was he 'shut up' worse than the Tartar of Samarcand, who one day shook\r\nhimself, gave up all tribal feuds, and, from the Sea of Okhotsk to the\r\nBaltic and southward to the Nerbudda, mastered the world?... The negro\r\nwent by himself far beyond the Australian savage. He learned the use of\r\nfire, the fact that sown grain will grow, the value of shelter, the use of\r\nthe bow and the canoe, and the good of clothes; but there to all\r\nappearances he stopped, unable, until stimulated by another race like the\r\nArab, to advance another step.\"[55]\r\n\r\nUnless, then, every lesson of history is to be disregarded, we must\r\nconclude that black Africa is unable to stand alone. The black man's\r\nnumbers may increase prodigiously and acquire alien veneers, but the black\r\nman's nature will not change. Black unrest may grow and cause much\r\ntrouble. Nevertheless, the white man must stand fast in Africa. No black\r\n\"renaissance\" impends, and Africa, if abandoned by the whites, would\r\nmerely fall beneath the onset of the browns. And that would be a great\r\ncalamity. As stated in the preceding chapter, the brown peoples, of\r\nthemselves, do not directly menace white race-areas, while Pan-Islamism is\r\nat present an essentially defensive movement. But Islam is militant by\r\nnature, and the Arab is a restless and warlike breed. Pan-Islamism once\r\npossessed of the Dark Continent and fired by militant zealots, might forge\r\nblack Africa into a sword of wrath, the executor of sinister adventures.\r\n\r\nFortunately the white man has every reason for keeping a firm hold on\r\nAfrica. Not only are its central tropics prime sources of raw materials\r\nand foodstuffs which white direction can alone develop, but to north and\r\nsouth the white man has struck deep roots into the soil. Both extremities\r\nof the continent are \"white man's country,\" where strong white peoples\r\nshould ultimately arise. Two of the chief white Powers, Britain and\r\nFrance, are pledged to the hilt in this racial task and will spare no\r\neffort to safeguard the heritage of their pioneering children. Brown\r\ninfluence in Africa is strong, but it is supreme only in the northeast and\r\nits line of communication with the Asiatic homeland runs over the narrow\r\nneck of Suez. Should stern necessity arise, the white world could hold\r\nSuez against Asiatic assault and crush brown resistance in Africa.\r\n\r\nIn short, the real danger to white control of Africa lies, not in brown\r\nattack or black revolt, but in possible white weakness through chronic\r\ndiscord within the white world itself. And that subject must be reserved\r\nfor later chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nRED MAN'S LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nRed Man's Land is the Americas between the Rio Grande and the tropic of\r\nCapricorn. Here dwells the \"Amerindian\" race. At the time of Columbus the\r\nwhole western hemisphere was theirs, but the white man has extirpated or\r\nabsorbed them to north and south, so that to-day the United States and\r\nCanada in North America and the southern portions of South America are\r\ngenuine \"white man's country.\" In the intermediate zone above mentioned,\r\nhowever, the Amerindian has survived and forms the majority of the\r\npopulation, albeit considerably mixed with white and to a lesser degree\r\nwith negro blood. The total number of \"Indians,\" including both\r\nfull-bloods and mixed types, is about 40,000,000--more than two-thirds of\r\nthe whole population. In addition, there are several million negroes and\r\nmulattoes, mostly in Brazil. The white population of the intermediate\r\nzone, even if we include \"near-whites,\" does not average more than 10 per\r\ncent, though it varies greatly with different regions. The reader should\r\nremember that neither the West India Islands nor the southern portion of\r\nthe South American continent are included in this generalization. In the\r\nWest Indies the Amerindian has completely died out and has been replaced\r\nby the negro, while southern South America, especially Argentina and\r\nUruguay, are genuine white man's country in which there is little Indian\r\nand no negro blood. Despite these exceptions, however, the fact remains\r\nthat, taken as a whole, \"Latin America,\" the vast land-block from the Rio\r\nGrande to Cape Horn, is racially not \"Latin\" but Amerindian or negroid,\r\nwith a thin Spanish or Portuguese veneer. In other words, though commonly\r\nconsidered part of the white world, most of Latin America is ethnically\r\ncolored man's land, which has been growing more colored for the past\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nLatin America's evolution was predetermined by the Spanish Conquest. That\r\nvery word \"conquest\" tells the story. The United States was _settled_ by\r\ncolonists planning homes and bringing their women. It was thus a genuine\r\nmigration, and resulted in a full transplanting of white stock to new\r\nsoil. The Indians encountered were wild nomads, fierce of temper and few\r\nin number. After sharp conflicts they were extirpated, leaving virtually\r\nno ethnic traces behind. The colonization of Latin America was the exact\r\nantithesis. The Spanish _Conquistadores_ were bold warriors descending\r\nupon vast regions inhabited by relatively dense populations, some of\r\nwhich, as in Mexico and Peru, had attained a certain degree of\r\ncivilization. The Spaniards, invincible in their shining armor, paralyzed\r\nwith terror these people still dwelling in the age of bronze and polished\r\nstone. With ridiculous ease mere handfuls of whites overthrew empires and\r\nlorded it like gods over servile and adoring multitudes. Cortez marched\r\non Mexico with less than 600 followers, while Pizarro had but 310\r\ncompanions when he started his conquest of Peru. Of course the fabulous\r\ntreasures amassed in these exploits drew swarms of bold adventurers from\r\nSpain. Nevertheless, their numbers were always infinitesimal compared with\r\nthe vastness of the quarry, while the proportion of women immigrants\r\ncontinued to lag far behind that of the men. The breeding of pure whites\r\nin Latin America was thus both scanty and slow.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the breeding of mixed-bloods began at once and attained\r\nnotable proportions. Having slaughtered the Indian males or brigaded them\r\nin slave-gangs, the Conquistadores took the Indian women to themselves.\r\nThe humblest man-at-arms had several female attendants, while the leaders\r\nbecame veritable pashas with great harems of concubines. The result was a\r\nprodigious output of half-breed children, known as \"mestizos\" or \"cholos.\"\r\n\r\nAnd soon a new ethnic complication was added. The Indians having developed\r\na melancholy trick of dying off under slavery, the Spaniards imported\r\nAfrican negroes to fill the servile ranks, and since they took negresses\r\nas well as Indian women for concubines, other\r\nhalf-breeds--mulattoes--appeared. Here and there Indians and negroes mated\r\non their own account, the offspring being known as \"zambos.\" In time these\r\nvarious hybrids bred among themselves, producing the most extraordinary\r\nethnic combinations. As Garcia-Calderon well puts it: \"Grotesque\r\ngenerations with every shade of complexion and every conformation of\r\nskull were born in America--a crucible continually agitated by unheard-of\r\nfusions of races.... But there was little Latin blood to be found in the\r\nhomes formed by the sensuality of the first conquerors of a desolated\r\nAmerica.\"[56]\r\n\r\nTo be sure, this mongrel population long remained politically negligible.\r\nThe Spaniards regarded themselves as a master-caste, and excluded all save\r\npure whites from civic rights and social privileges. In fact, the\r\nEuropean-born Spaniards refused to recognize even their colonial-born\r\nkinsmen as their equals, and \"Creoles\"[57] could not aspire to the higher\r\ndistinctions or offices. This attitude was largely inspired by the desire\r\nto maintain a lucrative monopoly. Yet the European's sense of superiority\r\nhad some valid grounds. There can be no doubt that the Creole whites, as a\r\nclass, showed increasing signs of degeneracy. Climate was a prime cause in\r\nthe hotter regions, but there were many plateau areas, as in Colombia,\r\nMexico, and Peru, which though geographically in the tropics had a\r\ntemperate climate from their elevation.\r\n\r\nEven more than by climate the Creole was injured by contact with the\r\ncolored races. Pampered and corrupted from birth by obsequious slaves, the\r\nCreole usually led an idle and vapid existence, disdaining work as\r\nservile and debarred from higher callings by his European-born superiors.\r\nAs time passed, the degeneracy due to climate and custom was intensified\r\nby degeneracy of blood. Despite legal enactment and social taboo, colored\r\nstrains percolated insidiously into the creole stock. The leading\r\nfamilies, by elaborate precautions, might succeed in keeping their\r\nescutcheons clean, but humbler circles darkened significantly despite\r\nfervid protestations of \"pure-white\" blood. Still, so long as Spain kept\r\nher hold on Latin America, the process of miscegenation, socially\r\nconsidered, was a slow one. The whole social system was based on the idea\r\nof white superiority, and the colors were carefully graded. \"In America,\"\r\nwrote Humboldt toward the close of Spanish rule, \"the more or less white\r\nskin determines the position which a man holds in society.\"[58]\r\n\r\nThe revolution against Spain had momentous consequences for the racial\r\nfuture of Latin America. In the beginning, to be sure, it was a white\r\ncivil war--a revolt of the Creoles against European oppression and\r\ndiscrimination. The heroes of the revolution--Bolivar, Miranda, San\r\nMartin, and the rest--were aristocrats of pure-white blood. But the\r\nrevolution presently developed new features. To begin with, the struggle\r\nwas very long. Commencing in 1809, it lasted almost twenty years. The\r\nwhites were decimated by fratricidal fury, and when the Spanish cause was\r\nfinally lost, multitudes of loyalists mainly of the superior social\r\nclasses left the country. Meanwhile, the half-castes, who had rallied\r\nwholesale to the revolutionary banner, were demanding their reward. The\r\nCreoles wished to close the revolutionary cycle and establish a new\r\nsociety based, like the old, upon white supremacy, with themselves\r\nsubstituted for the Spaniards. Bolivar planned a limited monarchy and a\r\nwhite electoral oligarchy. But this was far from suiting the half-castes.\r\nFor them the revolution had just begun. Raising the cry of \"democracy,\"\r\nthen become fashionable through the North American and French revolutions,\r\nthey proclaimed the doctrine of \"equality\" regardless of skin.\r\nDisillusioned and full of foreboding, Bolivar, the master-spirit of the\r\nrevolution, disappeared from the scene, and his lieutenants, like the\r\ngenerals of Alexander, quarrelled among themselves, split Latin America\r\ninto jarring fragments, and waged a long series of internecine wars. The\r\nflood-gates of anarchy were opened, the result being a steady weakening of\r\nthe whites and a corresponding rise of the half-castes in the political\r\nand social scale. Everywhere ambitious soldiers led the mongrel mob\r\nagainst the white aristocracy, breaking its power and making themselves\r\ndictators. These \"caudillos\" were apostles of equality and miscegenation.\r\nSays Garcia-Calderon: \"Tyrants found democracies; they lean on the support\r\nof the people, the half-breeds and negroes, against the oligarchies; they\r\ndominate the colonial nobility, favor the crossing of races, and free the\r\nslaves.\"[59]\r\n\r\nThe consequences of all this were lamentable in the extreme. Latin\r\nAmerica's level of civilization fell far below that of colonial days.\r\nSpanish rule, though narrow and tyrannical, had maintained peace and\r\nsocial stability. Now all was a hideous chaos wherein frenzied castes and\r\ncolors grappled to the death. Ignorant mestizos and brutal negroes\r\ntrampled the fine flowers of culture under foot, while as by a malignant\r\ninverse selection the most intelligent and the most cultivated perished.\r\n\r\nThese deplorable conditions prevailed in Latin America until well past the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century. Of course, here as elsewhere, anarchy\r\nengendered tyranny, and strong caudillos sometimes perpetuated their\r\ndictatorship for decades, as in Paraguay under Doctor Francia and in\r\nMexico under Porfirio Diaz. However, these were mere interludes, of no\r\nconstructive import. Always the aging lion lost his grip, the lurking\r\nhyenas of anarchy downed him at last, and the land sank once more into\r\nrevolutionary chaos. Some parts of Latin America did, indeed, definitely\r\nemerge into the light of stable progress. But those favored regions owed\r\ntheir deliverance, not to dictatorship, but to race. One of two factors\r\nalways operated: either (1) an efficient white oligarchy; or (2)\r\nAryanization through wholesale European immigration.\r\n\r\nStabilization through oligarchy is best illustrated by Chile. Chilean\r\nhistory differs widely from that of the rest of Latin America. A land of\r\ncool climate, no gold, and warlike Araucanian Indians, Chile attracted\r\nthe pioneering settler rather than the swashbuckling seeker of\r\ntreasure-trove. Now the pioneering types in Spain come mainly from those\r\nnorthern provinces which have retained considerable Nordic blood. The\r\nChilean colonists were thus largely blond Asturians or austere, reasonable\r\nBasques, seeking homes and bringing their women. Of course there was\r\ncrossing with the natives, but the fierce Araucanian aborigines clung to\r\ntheir wild freedom and kept up an interminable frontier warfare in which\r\nthe occasions for race-mixture were relatively few. The country was thus\r\nsettled by a resident squirearchy of an almost English type. This ruling\r\ngentry jealously guarded its racial integrity. In fact, it possessed not\r\nmerely a white but a Nordic race-consciousness. The Chilean gentry called\r\nthemselves sons of the Visigoths, scions of Euric and Pelayo, who had\r\nfound in remote Araucania a chance to slake their racial thirst for\r\nfighting and freedom.\r\n\r\nIn Chile, as elsewhere, the revolution provoked a cycle of disorder. But\r\nthe cycle was short, and was more a political struggle between white\r\nfactions than a social welter of caste and race. Furthermore, Chile was\r\nreceiving fresh accessions of Nordic blood. Many English, Scotch, and\r\nIrish gentleman-adventurers, taking part in the War of Independence,\r\nsettled down in a land so reminiscent of their own. Germans also came in\r\nconsiderable numbers, settling especially in the colder south. Thus the\r\nChilean upper classes, always pure white, became steadily more Nordic in\r\nethnic character. The political and social results were unmistakable.\r\nChile rapidly evolved a stable society, essentially oligarchic and\r\nconsciously patterned on aristocratic England. Efficient, practical, and\r\nextremely patriotic, the Chilean oligarchs made their country at once the\r\nmost stable and the most dynamic factor in Latin America.\r\n\r\nThe distinctly \"Northern\" character of Chile and the Chileans strike\r\nforeign observers. Here, for example, are the impressions of a recent\r\nvisitor, the North American sociologist, Professor E. A. Ross. Landing at\r\nthe port of Valparaiso, he is \"struck by signs of English influence. On\r\nthe commercial streets every third man suggests the Briton, while a large\r\nproportion of the business people look as if they have their daily tub.\r\nThe cleanliness of the streets, the freshness of the parks and squares,\r\nthe dressing of the shop-windows, and the style of the mounted police\r\nremind one of England.\"[60] As to the Nordic affinities of the upper\r\nclasses: \"One sees it in stature, eye color, and ruddy complexion....\r\nAmong the pupils of Santiago College there are as many blonds as\r\nbrunets.\"[61] Even among the peon or \"roto\" class, despite considerable\r\nIndian crossing, Professor Ross noted the strong Nordic strain, for he met\r\nChilean peasants \"whose stature, broad shoulders, big faces, and tawny\r\nmustaches proclaimed them as genuine Norsemen as the Icelanders in our\r\nRed River Valley.\"[62]\r\n\r\nChile is thus the prime example of social stability and progress attained\r\nthrough white oligarchic rule. Other, though less successful, instances\r\nare to be noted in Peru, Colombia, and Costa Rica. Peru and Colombia,\r\nthough geographically within the tropics, have extensive temperate\r\nplateaux. Here numerous whites settled during the colonial period, forming\r\nan upper caste over a large Indian population. Unlike Chile, few Nordics\r\ncame to leaven society with those qualities of constructive genius and\r\nracial self-respect which are the special birthright of Nordic man. Unlike\r\nChile again, not only were there dense Indian masses, but there was also\r\nan appreciable negro element. Lastly, the number of mixed-bloods was very\r\nlarge. It is thus not surprising that for both Peru and Colombia the\r\nrevolution ushered in a period of turmoil from which neither have even yet\r\nemerged. The whites have consistently fought among themselves, invoking\r\nthe half-castes as auxiliaries and using Indians and negroes as their\r\npawns. The whites are still the dominant element, but only the first\r\nfamilies retain their pure blood, and miscegenation creeps upward with\r\nevery successive generation. As for Costa Rica, it is a tiny bit of cool\r\nhill-country, settled by whites in colonial times, and to-day rises an\r\noasis of civilization, above the tropic jungle of degenerate, mongrel\r\nCentral America.\r\n\r\nThe second method of social stabilization in Latin America--Aryanization\r\nthrough wholesale European immigration--is exemplified by Argentina and\r\nUruguay. Neither of these lands had very promising beginnings. Their\r\npopulations, at the revolution, contained strong Indian infusions and\r\ntraces of negro blood, while after the revolution both fell under the sway\r\nof tyrannical dictators who persecuted the white aristocrats and favored\r\nmiscegenation. However, Argentina and Uruguay possessed two notable\r\nadvantages: they were climatically white man's country, and they at first\r\ncontained a very small population. Since they produced neither gold nor\r\ntropical luxuries, Spain had neglected them, so that at the revolution\r\nthey consisted of little more than the port-towns of Buenos Aires and\r\nMontevideo with a few dependent river-settlements. Their vast hinterlands\r\nof fertile prairie then harbored only wandering tribes of nomad savages.\r\n\r\nDuring the last half of the nineteenth century, however, the development\r\nof ocean transport gave these antipodean prairies value as stock-raising\r\nand grain-growing sources for congested Europe, and Europe promptly sent\r\nimmigrants to supply her needs. This immigrant stream gradually swelled to\r\na veritable deluge. The human tide was, on the whole, of sound stock,\r\nmostly Spaniards and north Italians, with some Nordic elements from\r\nnorthern Europe in the upper strata. Thus Europe locked antipodean America\r\nsecurely to the white world. As for the colonial stock, it merged easily\r\ninto the newer, kindred flood. Here and there signs of former\r\nmiscegenation still show, the Argentino being sometimes, as Madison Grant\r\nwell puts it, \"suspiciously swarthy.\"[63] Nevertheless, these are but\r\nvestigial traces which the ceaseless European inflow will ultimately\r\neradicate. The large impending German immigration to Argentina and Uruguay\r\nshould bring valuable Nordic elements.\r\n\r\nThis same tide of European immigration has likewise pretty well Aryanized\r\nthe southern provinces of Brazil, adjacent to the Uruguayan border. Those\r\nprovinces were neglected by Portugal as Argentina and Uruguay were by\r\nSpain, and half a century ago they had a very sparse population. To-day\r\nthey support millions of European immigrants, mostly Italians and European\r\nPortuguese, but with the further addition of nearly half a million\r\nGermans. Brazil is, in fact, evolving into two racially distinct\r\ncommunities. The southern provinces are white man's country, with little\r\nIndian or negro blood, and with a distinct \"color line.\" The tropical\r\nnorth is saturated with Indian and negro strains, and the whites are\r\nrapidly disappearing in a universal mongrelization. Ultimately this must\r\nproduce momentous political consequences.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the exceptions above noted, let us now observe the vast\r\ntropical and semi-tropical bulk of Latin America. Here we find notable\r\nchanges since colonial days. White predominance is substantially a thing\r\nof the past. Persons of unmixed Spanish or Portuguese descent are\r\nrelatively few, most of the so-called \"whites\" being really _near_-whites,\r\nmore or less deeply tinged with colored bloods. It is a striking token of\r\nwhite race-prestige that these near-whites, despite their degeneracy and\r\ninefficiency, are yet the dominant element; occupying, in fact, much the\r\nsame status as the aristocratic Creoles immediately after the War of\r\nIndependence. Nevertheless, the near-whites' supremacy is now threatened.\r\nEvery decade of chronic anarchy favors the darker half-breeds, while below\r\nthese, in turn, the Indian and negro full-bloods are beginning to stir, as\r\nin Mexico to-day.\r\n\r\nMost informed observers agree that the mixed-bloods of Latin America are\r\ndistinctly inferior to the whites. This applies to both mestizos and\r\nmulattoes, albeit the mestizo (the cross between white and Indian) seems\r\nless inferior than the mulatto--the cross between white and black. As for\r\nthe zambo, the Indian-negro cross, everybody is agreed that it is a very\r\nbad one. Analyses of these hybrid stocks show remarkable similarities to\r\nthe mongrel chaos of the declining Roman Empire. Here is the judgment of\r\nGarcia-Calderon, a Peruvian scholar and generally considered the most\r\nauthoritative writer on Latin America. \"The racial question,\" he writes,\r\n\"is a very serious problem in American history. It explains the progress\r\nof certain peoples and the decadence of others, and it is the key to the\r\nincurable disorder which divides America. Upon it depend a great number\r\nof secondary phenomena; the public wealth, the industrial system, the\r\nstability of governments, the solidity of patriotism.... This complication\r\nof castes, this admixture of diverse bloods, has created many problems.\r\nFor example, is the formation of a national consciousness possible with\r\nsuch disparate elements? Would such heterogeneous democracies be able to\r\nresist the invasion of superior races? Finally, is the South American\r\nhalf-caste absolutely incapable of organization and culture?\"[64] While\r\nqualifying his answers to these queries, Garcia-Calderon yet deplores the\r\nhalf-caste's \"decadence.\"[65] \"In the Iberian democracies,\" he says, \"an\r\ninferior Latinity, a Latinity of the decadence, prevails; verbal\r\nabundance, inflated rhetoric, oratorical exaggeration, just as in Roman\r\nSpain.... The half-caste loves grace, verbal elegance, quibbles even, and\r\nartistic form; great passions and desires do not move him. In religion he\r\nis sceptical, indifferent, and in politics he disputes in the Byzantine\r\nmanner. No one could discover in him a trace of his Spanish forefather,\r\nstoical and adventurous.\"[66] Garcia-Calderon therefore concludes: \"The\r\nmixture of rival castes, Iberians, Indians, and negroes, has generally had\r\ndisastrous consequences.... None of the conditions established by the\r\nFrench psychologists are realized by the Latin American democracies, and\r\ntheir populations are therefore degenerate. The lower castes struggle\r\nsuccessfully against the traditional rules: the order which formerly\r\nexisted is followed by moral anarchy; solid conviction by a superficial\r\nscepticism; and the Castilian tenacity by indecision. The black race is\r\ndoing its work, and the continent is returning to its primitive\r\nbarbarism.\"[67] This melancholy fate can, according to Garcia-Calderon, be\r\naverted only by wholesale white immigration: \"In South America\r\ncivilization is dependent upon the numerical predominance of the\r\nvictorious Spaniard, on the triumph of the white man over the mulatto, the\r\nnegro, and the Indian. Only a plentiful European immigration can\r\nre-establish the shattered equilibrium of the American races.\"[68]\r\n\r\nGarcia-Calderon's pronouncements are echoed by foreign observers. During\r\nhis South American travels Professor Ross noted the same melancholy\r\nsymptoms and pointed out the same unique remedy. Speaking of Ecuador, he\r\nsays: \"I found no foreigners who have faith in the future of this people.\r\nThey point out that while this was a Spanish colony there was a continual\r\nflow of immigrants from Spain, many of whom, no doubt, were men of force.\r\nPolitical separation interrupted this current, and since then the country\r\nhas really gone back. Spain had provided a ruling, organizing element,\r\nand, with the cessation of the flow of Spaniards, the mixed-bloods took\r\ncharge of things, for the pure-white element is so small as to be\r\nnegligible. No one suggests that the mestizos equal the white stock either\r\nin intellect or in character.... Among the rougher foreigners and\r\nPeruvians the pet name for these people is 'monkeys.' The thoughtful often\r\nliken them to Eurasians, clever enough, but lacking in solidity of\r\ncharacter. Natives and foreigners alike declare that a large white\r\nimmigration is the only hope for Ecuador.\"[69]\r\n\r\nConcerning Bolivia, Professor Ross writes: \"The wisest sociologist in\r\nBolivia told me that the zambo, resulting from the union of Indian with\r\nnegro, is inferior to both the parent races, and that likewise the mestizo\r\nis inferior to both white and Indian in physical strength, resistance to\r\ndisease, longevity, and brains. The failure of the South American\r\nrepublics has been due, he declares, to mestizo domination. Through the\r\ncolonial period there was a flow of Spaniards to the colonies, and all the\r\noffices down to _corregidor_ and _cura_ were filled by white men. With\r\nindependence, the whites ceased coming, and the lower offices of state and\r\nchurch were filled with mestizos. Then, too, the first crossing of white\r\nwith Indian gave a better result than the union between mestizos, so that\r\nthe stock has undergone progressive degeneration. The only thing, then,\r\nthat can make these countries progress is a large white immigration,\r\nsomething much talked about by statesmen in all these countries, but which\r\nhas never materialized.\"[70]\r\n\r\nThese judgments refer particularly to Spanish America. Regarding\r\nPortuguese Brazil, however, the verdict seems to be the same. Many years\r\nago Professor Agassiz wrote: \"Let any one who doubts the evil of this\r\nmixture of races, and is inclined from mistaken philanthropy to break down\r\nall barriers between them, come to Brazil. He cannot deny the\r\ndeterioration consequent upon the amalgamation of races, more wide-spread\r\nhere than in any country in the world, and which is rapidly effacing the\r\nbest qualities of the white man, the negro, and the Indian, leaving a\r\nmongrel, nondescript type, deficient in physical and mental energy.\"[71]\r\n\r\nThe mongrel's political ascendancy produces precisely the results which\r\nmight have been expected. These unhappy beings, every cell of whose bodies\r\nis a battle-ground of jarring heredities, express their souls in acts of\r\nhectic violence and aimless instability. The normal state of tropical\r\nAmerica is anarchy, restrained only by domestic tyrants or foreign\r\nmasters. Garcia-Calderon exactly describes its psychology when he writes:\r\n\"Precocious, sensual, impressionable, the Americans of these vast\r\nterritories devote their energies to local politics. Industry, commerce,\r\nand agriculture are in a state of decay, and the unruly imagination of the\r\nCreole expends itself in constitutions, programmes, and lyrical\r\ndiscourses; in these regions anarchy is sovereign mistress.\"[72] The\r\ntropical republics display, indeed, a tendency toward \"atomic\r\ndisintegration.... Given to dreaming, they are led by presidents suffering\r\nfrom neurosis.\"[73]\r\n\r\nThe stock feature of the mongrel tropics is, of course, the \"revolution.\"\r\nThese senseless and perennial outbursts are often ridiculed in the United\r\nStates as comic opera, but the grim truth of the matter is that few Latin\r\nAmerican revolutions are laughing matters. The numbers of men engaged may\r\nnot be very large according to our standards, but measured by the scanty\r\npopulations of the countries concerned, they lay a heavy blood-tax on the\r\nsuffering peoples. The tatterdemalion \"armies\" may excite our mirth, but\r\nthe battles are real enough, often fought out to the death with\r\nrazor-edged machetes and rusty bayonets, and there is no more ghastly\r\nsight than a Latin American battle-field. The commandeerings, burnings,\r\nrapings, and assassinations inflicted upon the hapless civilian population\r\ncry to heaven. There is always wholesale destruction of property,\r\nfrequently appalling loss of life, and a general paralysis of economic and\r\nsocial activity. These wretched lands have now been scourged by the\r\nrevolutionary plague for a hundred years, and W. B. Hale does not\r\noverstate the consequences when he says: \"Most of the countries clustering\r\nabout the Caribbean have sunk into deeper and deeper mires of misrule,\r\nunmatched for profligacy and violence anywhere on earth. Revolution\r\nfollows revolution; one band of brigands succeeds another; atrocities\r\nrevenge atrocities; the plundered people grow more and more abject in\r\npoverty and slavishness; vast natural resources lie neglected, while\r\npopulations decrease, civilization recedes, and the jungle advances.\"[74]\r\nOf course, under these frightful circumstances, the national character,\r\nweak enough at best, degenerates at an ever-quickening pace. Peaceful\r\neffort of any sort appears vain and ridiculous, and men are taught that\r\nwealth is procurable only by violence and extortion.\r\n\r\nAnother important point should be noted. I have said that Latin American\r\nanarchy was restrained by dictatorship. But the reader must not infer that\r\ndictatorships are halcyon times--for the dictated. On the contrary, they\r\nare usually only a trifle less wretched and demoralizing than times of\r\nrevolution. The \"caudillos\" are nearly always very sinister figures. Often\r\nthey are ignorant brutes; oftener they are blood-thirsty, lecherous\r\nmonsters; oftenest they are human spiders who suck the land dry of all\r\nfluid wealth, banking it abroad against the day when they shall fly before\r\nthe revolutionary blast to the safe haven of Paris and the congenial\r\ndebaucheries of Montmartre. The millions amassed by tyrants like Castro of\r\nVenezuela and Zelaya of Nicaragua are almost beyond belief, considering\r\nthe backward, bankrupt lands they have \"administered.\"\r\n\r\nYet how can it be otherwise? Consider Critchfield's incisive account of a\r\ncaudillo's accession to power: \"When an ignorant and brutal man, whose\r\nentire knowledge of the world is confined to a few Indian villages, and\r\nwhose total experience has been gained in the raising of cattle, doffs his\r\n_alpagartes_, and, machete in hand, cuts his way to power in a few weeks,\r\nwith a savage horde at his back who know nothing of the amenities of\r\ncivilization and care less than they know--when such a man comes to\r\npower, evil and evil only can result. Even if the new dictator were\r\nwell-intentioned, his entire ignorance of law and constitutional forms, of\r\ncommercial processes and manufacturing arts, and of the fundamental and\r\nnecessary principles underlying all stable and free governments, would\r\nrender a successful administration by him extremely difficult, if not\r\nimpossible. But he is surrounded by all the elements of vice and flattery,\r\nand he is imbued with that vain and absurd egotism which makes men of\r\nsmall caliber imagine themselves to be Napoleons or Caesars. Thus do petty\r\ndespotisms, unrestrained by constitutional provisions or by anything like\r\na virile public opinion, lead from absurdity to outrage and crime.\"[75]\r\n\r\nSuch is the situation in mongrel-ruled America: revolution breeding\r\nrevolution, tyranny breeding tyranny, and the twain combining to ruin\r\ntheir victims and force them ever deeper into the slough of degenerate\r\nbarbarism. The whites have lost their grip and are rapidly disappearing.\r\nThe mixed-breeds have had their chance and have grotesquely failed. The\r\noft-quoted panacea--white immigration--is under present conditions a vain\r\ndream, for white immigrants will not expose themselves (and still less\r\ntheir women) to the horrors of mongrel rule. So far, their, as internal\r\nfactors are concerned, anarchy seems destined to continue unchecked.\r\n\r\nIn fact, new conflicts loom on the horizon. The Indian masses, so docile\r\nto the genuine white man, begin to stir. The aureole of white prestige has\r\nbeen besmirched by the near-whites and half-castes who have traded so\r\nrecklessly upon its sanctions. Strong in the poise of normal heredity, the\r\nIndian full-blood commences to despise these chaotic masters who turn his\r\nhomelands into bear-gardens and witches' sabbaths. An \"Indianista\"\r\nmovement is to-day on foot throughout mongrel-ruled America. It is most\r\npronounced in Mexico, whose interminable agony becomes more and more a war\r\nof Indian resurgence, but it is also starting along the west coast of\r\nSouth America. Long ago, wise old Professor Pearson saw how the wind was\r\nblowing. Noting how whites and near-whites were \"everywhere fighting and\r\nintriguing for the spoils of office,\" he also noted that the Indian\r\nmasses, though relatively passive and \"seemingly unobservant,\" were yet\r\n\"conquering a place for themselves in other ways than by increasing and\r\nmultiplying,\" and he concluded: \"the general level of the autochthonous\r\nrace is being raised; it is acquiring riches and self-respect, and must\r\nsooner or later get the country back into its hands.\"[76] Recent visitors\r\nto the South American west coast note the signs of Indian unrest. Some\r\nyears ago Lord Bryce remarked of Bolivia: \"There have been Indian risings,\r\nand firearms are more largely in their hands than formerly. They so\r\npreponderate in numbers that any movement which united them against the\r\nupper class might, could they find a leader, have serious\r\nconsequences.\"[77] Still more recently Professor Ross wrote concerning\r\nPeru: \"In Cuzco I met a gentleman of education and travel who is said to\r\nbe the only living lineal descendant of the Incas. He has great influence\r\nwith the native element and voices their bitterness and their aspirations.\r\nHe declares that the politics of Peru is a struggle between the Spanish\r\nmestizos of Lima and the coast and the natives of Cuzco and the interior,\r\nand predicts an uprising unless Cuzco is made the capital of the nation.\r\nHe even dreams of a Kechua republic, with Cuzco as its capital and the\r\nUnited States its guarantor, as she is guarantor of the Cuban\r\nrepublic.\"[78] And of Bolivia, Professor Ross writes: \"Lately there has\r\nbeen a general movement of the Bolivian Indians for the recovery of the\r\nlands of which they have been robbed piecemeal. Conflicts have broken out\r\nand, although the government has punished the ringleaders, there is a\r\nfeeling that, so long as the exploiting of the Indian goes on, Bolivians\r\nare living 'in the crater of a slumbering volcano.'\"[79]\r\n\r\nSince the white man has gone and the Indian is preparing to wrest the\r\nsceptre of authority from the mongrel's worthless hands, let us examine\r\nthis Indian race, to see what potentiality it possesses of restoring order\r\nand initiating progress.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there can be no doubt that the Indian is superior to the\r\nnegro. The negro, even when quickened by foreign influences, never built\r\nup anything approaching a real civilization; whereas the Indian, though\r\nentirely sundered from the rest of mankind, evolved genuine polities and\r\ncultures like the Aztec of Mexico, the Inca of Peru, and the Maya of\r\nYucatan. The Indian thus possesses creative capacity to an appreciable\r\ndegree. However, that degree seems strictly limited. The researches of\r\narchaeologists have sadly discounted the glowing tales of the\r\nConquistadores, and the \"Empires\" of Mexico and Peru, though far from\r\ncontemptible, certainly rank well below the achievements of European and\r\nAsiatic races in mediaeval and even in classic times.\r\n\r\nThe Indian possesses notable stability and poise, but the very intensity\r\nof these qualities fetters his progress and renders questionable his\r\nability to rise to the modern plane. His conservatism is immense. With\r\nincredible tenacity he clings to his ancestral ways and exhibits a dull\r\nindifference to alien innovation. Of course the Indian sub-races differ\r\nconsiderably among themselves, but the same fundamental tendencies are\r\nvisible in all of them. Says Professor Ellsworth Huntington: \"The Indians\r\nare very backward. They are dull of mind and slow to adopt new ideas.\r\nPerhaps in the future they will change, but the fact that they have been\r\ninfluenced so little by four hundred years of contact with the white man\r\ndoes not afford much ground for hope. Judging from the past, there is no\r\nreason to think that their character is likely to change for many\r\ngenerations.... Those who dwell permanently in the white man's cities are\r\ninfluenced somewhat, but here as in other cases the general tendency seems\r\nto be to revert to the original condition as soon as the special impetus\r\nof immediate contact with the white man is removed.\"[80] And Lord Bryce\r\nwrites in similar vein: \"With plenty of stability, they lack initiative.\r\nThey make steady soldiers, and fight well under white or mestizo leaders,\r\nbut one seldom hears of a pure Indian accomplishing anything or rising\r\neither through war or politics, or in any profession, above the level of\r\nhis class....\"[81]\r\n\r\nThe truth about the Indian seems to be substantially this: Left alone, he\r\nwould probably have continued to progress, albeit much more slowly than\r\neither white or Asiatic peoples. But the Indian was not left alone. On the\r\ncontrary, he was suddenly felled by brutal and fanatical conquerors, who\r\nuprooted his native culture and plunged him into abject servitude. The\r\nIndian's spiritual past was shorn away and his evolution was perverted.\r\nPrevented from developing along his own lines, and constitutionally\r\nincapable of adapting himself to the ways of his Spanish conquerors, the\r\nIndian vegetated, learning nothing and forgetting much that he knew. This\r\nhas continued for four hundred years. Is it not likely that his ancestral\r\naptitudes have atrophied or decayed? Slavery and mental sloth have indeed\r\nscarred him with their fell stigmata. Says Garcia-Calderon: \"Without\r\nsufficient food, without hygiene, a distracted and laborious beast, he\r\ndecays and perishes; to forget the misery of his daily lot he drinks,\r\nbecomes an alcoholic, and his numerous progeny present the characteristics\r\nof degeneracy.\"[82]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Indian degenerates from another cause--mongrelization.\r\nMiscegenation is a dual process. It works upward and downward at one and\r\nthe same time. In Latin America hybridization has been prodigious, the\r\nhybrids to-day numbering millions. In some regions, as in Venezuela and\r\nparts of Central America, there are very few full-blooded Indians left,\r\nhybrids forming practically the entire population. Now, on the whole, the\r\nwhite or \"mestizo\" crossing seems hurtful to the Indian, for what he gains\r\nin intelligence he more than loses in character. But the mestizo crossing\r\nis not the worst. There is another, much graver, racial danger. The hot\r\ncoastlands swarm with negroes, and the zambo or negro-Indian is\r\nuniversally adjudged the worst of matings. Thus, for the Indian, white\r\nblood appears harmful, while black blood is absolutely fatal. Yet the\r\nmongrelizing tide sweeps steadily on. The Indian draws no \"color line,\"\r\nand continually impairs the purity of his blood and the poise of his\r\nheredity.\r\n\r\nBearing all the above facts in mind, can we believe the Indian capable of\r\ndrawing mongrel-ruled America from its slough of despond? Can he set it on\r\nthe path of orderly progress? It does not seem possible. Assuming for the\r\nsake of argument complete freedom from foreign intervention, the Indian\r\nmight in time displace his mongrel rulers--provided he himself were not\r\nalso mongrelized. But the present \"Indianista\" movement is not a sign of\r\nIndian political efficiency; not the harbinger of an Indian \"renaissance.\"\r\nIt is the instinctive turning of the harried beast on his tormentor.\r\nMaddened by the cruel vagaries of mongrel rule and increasingly conscious\r\nof the mongrel's innate worthlessness, the Indian at last bares his teeth.\r\nUnder civilized white tutelage the \"Indianista\" movement would have been\r\npractically inconceivable.\r\n\r\nHowever, guesses as to the final outcome of an Indian-mongrel conflict are\r\nacademic speculation, because mongrel America will not be left to itself.\r\nMongrel America cannot stand alone. Indeed, it never has stood alone, for\r\nit has always been bolstered up by the Monroe Doctrine. But for our\r\nprotection, outside forces would have long since rushed into this\r\npolitical and economic vacuum, and every omen to-day denotes that this\r\nvacuum, like all others, will presently be filled. A world close packed as\r\nnever before will not tolerate countries that are a torment to themselves\r\nand a dangerous nuisance to their neighbors. A world half bankrupt will\r\nnot allow vast sources of potential wealth to lie in hands which idle or\r\nmisuse. Thus it is practically certain that mongrel America will presently\r\npass under foreign tutelage. Exactly how, is not yet clear. It may be done\r\nby the United States alone, or, what is more probable, in \"Pan-American\"\r\nco-operation with the lusty young white nations of the antipodean south.\r\nIt may be done by an even larger combination, including some European\r\nstates. After all, the details of such action do not lie within the scope\r\nof this book, since they fall exclusively within the white man's sphere of\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another dynamic which might transform mongrel America.\r\nThis dynamic is yellow Asia. The Far East teems with virile and laborious\r\nlife. It thrills to novel ambitions and desires. Avid with the urge of\r\nswarming myriads, it hungrily seeks outlets for its superabundant\r\nvitality. We have already seen how the Mongolian has earmarked the whole\r\nFar East for his own, and in subsequent pages we shall see how he also\r\nbeats restlessly against the white world's race-frontiers. But mongrel\r\nAmerica! What other field offers such tempting possibilities for Mongolian\r\nrace-expansion? Vast regions of incalculable, unexploited wealth, sparsely\r\ninhabited by stagnant populations cursed with anarchy and feeble from\r\nmiscegenation--how could such lands resist the onslaught of tenacious and\r\nindomitable millions? The answer is self-evident. They could not resist;\r\nand such an invasion, once begun, would be consummated with a celerity and\r\nthoroughness perhaps unexampled in human history.\r\n\r\nNow the yellow world is alive to this momentous possibility. Japan, in\r\nparticular, has glimpsed in Latin America precious avenues to that racial\r\nexpansion which is the key-note of Japanese foreign policy. For years\r\nJapanese statesmen and publicists have busied themselves with the problem.\r\nThe Chinese had, in fact, already pointed the way, for during the later\r\ndecades of the nineteenth century Chinamen frequented Latin America's\r\nPacific coast, economically vanquishing the natives with ease, and\r\nsettling in Peru in such numbers that the alarmed Peruvians hastily\r\nstopped the inflow by drastic exclusion acts. The successes of these\r\nChinese pioneers, humble coolies entirely without official backing, have\r\nfired the Japanese imagination. The Japanese press has long discussed\r\nLatin America in optimistic vein. Count Okuma is a good exemplar of these\r\nJapanese aspirations. Some years ago he told the American sociologist\r\nProfessor Ross: \"South America, especially the northern part, will furnish\r\nample room for our surplus.\"[83] To his fellow countrymen Count Okuma was\r\nstill more specific. In 1907 he stated in the Tokio _Economist_ that the\r\nJapanese were to overspread the earth like a cloud of locusts, alighting\r\non the North American coasts, and swarming into Central and South America.\r\nCount Okuma expressed a strong preference for Latin American countries as\r\nfields for Japanese immigration, because most of them were \"much easier to\r\ninclude within the sphere of influence of Japan in the future.\"[84]\r\n\r\nAnd the Japanese have supplemented words with deeds. Especially since\r\n1914, Japanese activity in Latin America has been ubiquitous and\r\nstriking. The west coast of South America, in particular, is to-day\r\nflooded with Japanese goods, merchants, commercial missions, and financial\r\nagents seeking concessions of every kind. Our State Department has had to\r\nexercise special vigilance concerning Japanese concession-hunting in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nJapan's present activity is of course mere reconnoitring--testings and\r\nmappings of terrain for possible later action on a more extensive scale.\r\nOne thing alone gives Japan pause--our veto. Japan knows that real\r\naggression against our southern neighbors would spell war with the United\r\nStates. Japan does not contemplate war with us at present. She has many\r\nfish to fry in the Far East. So in Latin America she plays safe. But she\r\nbides her time. In Latin America itself she has friends--even partisans.\r\nJapan seeks to mobilize to her profit that distrust of the \"Yanqui\" which\r\npermeates Latin America. The half-castes, in particular, rage at our\r\n\"color line\" and see in the United States the Nemesis of their anarchic\r\nmisrule. They flout the Monroe Doctrine, caress dreams of Japanese aid,\r\nand welcome Nippon's pose as the champion of color throughout the world.\r\n\r\nJapanese activities in Mexico are of especial interest. Here Japan has\r\nthree strong strings to her bow: (1) patriotic dislike of the United\r\nStates; (2) mestizo hatred of the white \"gringo\"; (3) the Indianista\r\nmovement. In Mexico the past decade of revolutionary turmoil has developed\r\ninto a complicated race-war of the mestizos against the white or\r\nnear-white upper class and of the Indian full-bloods against both whites\r\nand mestizos. The one bond of union is dislike of the gringo, which often\r\nrises to fanatical hatred. Our war against Mexico in 1847 has never been\r\nforgotten, and many Mexicans cherish hopes of revenge and even aspire to\r\nrecover the territories then ceded to us. During the early stages of the\r\nEuropean War our military unpreparedness and apparent pacifism actually\r\nemboldened some Mexican hotheads to concoct the notorious \"Plan of San\r\nDiego.\" The conspirators plotted to rouse the Mexican population of our\r\nsouthern border, sow disaffection among our Southern negroes, and explode\r\nthe mine at the psychological moment by means of a \"Reconquering Equitable\r\nArmy\" invading Texas. Our whole Southwest was to be rejoined to Mexico,\r\nwhile our Southern States were to form a black republic. The projected war\r\nwas conceived strictly in terms of race, the reconquering equitable army\r\nto be composed solely of \"Latins,\" negroes, and Japanese. The racial\r\nresults were to be decisive, for the entire white population of both our\r\nSouth and Southwest was to be pitilessly massacred. Of course the plot\r\ncompletely miscarried, and sporadic attempts to invade Texas during 1915\r\nwere easily repulsed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this incident reveals the trend of many Mexican minds. The\r\nframers of the \"Plan of San Diego\" were not ignorant peons, but persons of\r\nsome standing. The outrages and tortures inflicted upon numerous Americans\r\nin Mexico during recent years are further indications of that wide-spread\r\nhatred which expresses itself in vitriolic outbursts like the following\r\neditorial of a Mexican provincial paper, written during our chase after\r\nthe bandit Villa in 1916: \"Above all, do not forget that at a time of\r\nnational need, humanity is a crime and frightfulness is a virtue. Pull out\r\neyes, snatch out hearts, tear open breasts, drink--if you can--the blood\r\nin the skulls of the invaders from the cities of Yankeeland. In defense of\r\nliberty be a Nero, be a Caligula--that is to be a good patriot. Peace\r\nbetween Mexico and the United States will be closed in throes of terror\r\nand barbarism.\"[85]\r\n\r\nAll this is naturally grist for the Japanese mill. Especially interesting\r\nare Japanese attempts to play upon Mexican Indianista sentiment. Japanese\r\nwriters point out physical and cultural similarities between the Mexican\r\nnative races and themselves, deducing therefrom innate racial affinities\r\nspringing from the remote and forgotten past. All possible sympathetic\r\nchanges were rung during the diplomatic mission of Senor de la Barra to\r\nJapan at the beginning of 1914. His reception in Tokio was a memorable\r\nevent. Senor de la Barra was greeted by cheering multitudes, and on every\r\noccasion the manifold bonds between the two peoples were emphasized. This\r\nof course occurred before the European War. During the war\r\nJapanese-Mexican relations remained amicable. So far as official evidence\r\ngoes, the Japanese Government has never entered into any understandings\r\nwith the Mexican Government, though some Mexicans have hinted at a secret\r\nagreement, and one Mexican writer, Gutierrez de Lara, asserts that in 1912\r\nFrancisco Madero, then President, \"threw himself into the arms of Japan,\"\r\nand goes on: \"We are well aware of the importance of this statement and of\r\nits tremendous international significance, but we make it deliberately\r\nwith full confidence in our authority. Not only did Madero enlist the\r\nardent support of the South American republics in the cause of Mexico's\r\ninviolability, but he entered into negotiations with the Japanese minister\r\nin Mexico City for a close offensive and defensive alliance with Japan to\r\ncheckmate United States aggression. When during the fateful twelve days'\r\nbattle in Mexico City a rumor of American intervention, more alarming than\r\nusual, was communicated to Madero, he remarked coldly that he was\r\nthoroughly anxious for that intervention, for he was confident of the\r\nsurprise the American Government would receive in discovering that they\r\nhad to deal with Japan.\"[86]\r\n\r\nBut, after all, an official Japanese-Mexican understanding is not the\r\nfundamental issue. The really significant thing is Mexican popular\r\nantagonism to the United States, which is so wide-spread that Japan could\r\nin a crisis probably count on Mexican benevolent neutrality if not on\r\nMexican support. The present Carranza government of Mexico is of course\r\nnotoriously anti-American. Its consistent policy, notably revealed in its\r\ncomplaisance toward Germany and its intrigues with other anti-American\r\nregimes like those of Colombia and Venezuela, makes Mexico the centre of\r\nanti-Americanism in Latin America. As for the numerous Japanese residents\r\nin Mexico, they have lost no opportunity to abet this attitude. Here, for\r\ninstance, is the text of a manifesto signed by prominent members of the\r\nJapanese colony during the American-Mexican crisis of 1916: \"Japanese:\r\nMexico is a friendly nation. Our commercial bonds with her are great. She\r\nis, like us, a nation of heroes who will never consent to the\r\nworld-domination of a hard and brutal race, as are the Yankees. We cannot\r\nabandon Mexico in her struggle against a nation supposedly stronger. The\r\nMexicans know how to defend themselves, but there is lacking aid which we\r\ncan furnish. If the Yankees invade Mexico, if they seize the California\r\ncoasts, Japanese commerce and the Japanese navy will face a grave peril.\r\nThe Yankees believe us impotent because of the European War, and we will\r\nbe expelled from American soil and our children from American schools. We\r\nwill aid the Mexicans. We will aid Mexico against Yankee rapacity. This\r\ngreat and beautiful country is a victim of Yankee hatred toward Japan. Our\r\nindifference would be a lack of patriotism, since the Yankees already are\r\nagainst us and our divine Emperor. They have seized Hawaii, they have\r\nseized the Philippine Islands, near our coasts, and are now about to\r\ncrush under foot our friend and possible ally, and injure our commerce and\r\nimperil our naval power.\"[87]\r\n\r\nThe fact is that Latin America's attitude toward the yellow world tends\r\neverywhere to crystallize along race lines. The half-castes, naturally\r\nhostile to the United States, see in Japan a welcome offset to the\r\n\"Colossus of the North.\" The self-conscious Indianista elements likewise\r\nheed Japanese suggestions of ethnic affinity. On the other hand, the\r\nwhites and near-whites instinctively react against Japanese advances. Even\r\nthose who have no love for the Yankee see in the Mongolian the greatest of\r\nperils. Garcia-Calderon typifies this point of view. He dreads our\r\nimperialistic tendencies, yet he reproves those Latin Americans who, in a\r\nJapanese-American clash, would favor Japan. \"Victorious,\" he writes, \"the\r\nJapanese would invade Western America and convert the Pacific into a vast\r\nclosed sea, closed to foreign ambitions, _mare nostrum_, peopled with\r\nJapanese colonies. The Japanese hegemony would not be a mere change of\r\ntutelage for the nations of America. In spite of essential differences,\r\nthe Latins oversea have certain common ties with the people of the\r\n(United) States: a long-established religion, Christianity, and a\r\ncoherent, European, Occidental civilization. Perhaps there is some obscure\r\nfraternity between the Japanese and the American Indians, between the\r\nyellow men of Nippon and the copper-colored Quechuas, a disciplined and\r\nsober people. But the ruling race, the dominant type of Spanish origin,\r\nwhich imposes the civilization of the white man upon America, is hostile\r\nto the entire invading East.\"[88]\r\n\r\nWhite men throughout Latin America generally echo these sentiments. Chile\r\nand Argentina repulse Oriental immigration, and the white oligarchs of\r\nPeru dread keenly Japanese designs directed so specifically against their\r\ncountry. Very recently a Peruvian, Doctor Jorge M. Corbacho,[89] wrote\r\nmost bitterly about the Japanese infiltration into Peru and adjacent\r\nBolivia, while some years ago Senor Augustin Edwards, owner of the leading\r\nChilean periodical, _El Mercurio_, denounced Count Okuma's menaces and\r\ncalled for a Pan-American rampart against Asia from Behring Strait to Cape\r\nHorn. \"Japanese immigration,\" asserted Senor Edwards, \"must be firmly\r\nopposed, not only in South America, but in the whole American continent.\r\nThe same remark applies to Chinese immigration.... In short, these threats\r\nof Okuma should induce the nations of South America to adopt the Monroe\r\nDoctrine--an invincible weapon against the plans and intentions of that\r\n'Empire of the Orient,' which has so lately risen up to new life, and\r\nalready manifests so dire a greed of conquest.\"[90] From Central America\r\nsimilar voices arise. A Salvadorean writer urges political federation\r\nwith the United States as the sole refuge against the \"Yellow Peril,\" to\r\navoid becoming \"slaves and utterly insignificant\";[91] and a well-known\r\nNicaraguan politician, Senor Moncada,[92] writes in similar vein.\r\n\r\nThe momentous implications of Mongolian pressure upon Latin America are\r\nadmirably described by Professor Ross. \"Provided that no barrier be\r\ninterposed to the inflow from man-stifled Asia,\" he says, \"it is well\r\nwithin the bounds of probability that by the close of this century South\r\nAmerica will be the home of twenty or thirty millions of Orientals and\r\ndescendants of Orientals.... But Asiatic immigration of such volume would\r\nchange profoundly the destiny of South America. For one thing, it would\r\nforestall and frustrate that great immigration of Europeans which South\r\nAmerican statesmen are counting on to relieve their countries from mestizo\r\nunprogressiveness and misgovernment. The white race would withhold its\r\nincrease or look elsewhere for outlets; for those with the higher standard\r\nof comfort always shun competition with those of a lower standard. Again,\r\nlarge areas of South America might cease to be parts of Christendom. Some\r\nof the republics there might come to be as dependent upon Asiatic Powers\r\nas the Cuban republic is dependent upon the United States.\"[93]\r\n\r\nVery pertinent is Professor Ross's warning as to the fate of the Indian\r\npopulation--a warning which Indianista believers in Japanese \"affinity\"\r\nshould seriously take to heart. Whatever might be the lot of the Latin\r\nAmerican whites, Professor Ross points out that \"an Asiatic influx would\r\nseal the doom of the Indian element in these countries.... The Indians\r\ncould make no effective economic stand against the wide-awake,\r\nresourceful, and aggressive Japanese or Chinese. The Oriental immigrants\r\ncould beat the Indians at every point, block every path upward, and even\r\nturn them out of most of their present employments. In great part the\r\nIndians would become a cringing _sudra_ caste, tilling the poorer lands\r\nand confined to the menial or repulsive occupations. Filled with despair,\r\nand abandoning themselves even more than they do now to pisco and coca,\r\nthey would shrivel into a numerically negligible element in the\r\npopulation.\"[94]\r\n\r\nSuch are the underlying factors in the Latin American situation. Once more\r\nwe see the essential instability of mere political phenomena. Once more we\r\nsee the supreme importance of race. No conquest could have been completer\r\nthan that of the Spaniards four centuries ago. The Indians were helpless\r\nas sheep before the mail-clad Conquistadores. And military conquest was\r\nsucceeded by complete political domination. The Indian even lost his\r\ncultural heritage, and became a passive tool in the hands of his white\r\nmasters. But the Spaniard did not seal his title-deed with the indelible\r\nsignet of race. Indian blood remained numerically predominant, and the\r\nconqueror further weakened his tenure by bringing in black blood--the most\r\nirreducible of ethnic factors. The inflow of white blood was small, and\r\nmuch of what did come lost itself in the dismal swamp of miscegenation.\r\nLastly, the whites quarrelled among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe result was inevitable. The colonial whites triumphed only by aid of\r\nthe half-castes, who promptly claimed their reward. A fresh struggle\r\nensued, ending (save in the antipodean regions) in the triumph of the\r\nhalf-castes. But these, in turn, had called in the Indians and negroes.\r\nFurthermore, the half-castes recklessly squandered the white political\r\nheritage. So the colored full-bloods stirred in their turn, and a new\r\nmovement began which, if allowed to run its natural course, might result\r\nin complete de-Aryanization. In other words, the white race has been going\r\nback, and Latin America has been getting more Indian and negro for the\r\npast hundred years.\r\n\r\nThis cycle, however, now nears its end. Latin America will be neither red\r\nnor black. It will ultimately be either white or yellow. The Indian is\r\npatently unable to construct a progressive civilization. As for the negro,\r\nhe has proved as incapable in the New World as in the Old. Everywhere his\r\npresence has spelled regression, and his one New World field of\r\ntriumph--Haiti--has resulted in an abysmal plunge to the jungle-level of\r\nGuinea and the Congo. Thus is created a political vacuum. And this vacuum\r\nunerring nature makes ready to fill.\r\n\r\nThe Latin American situation is, indeed, akin to that of Africa. Latin\r\nAmerica, like Africa, cannot stand alone. An inexorable dilemma impends:\r\nwhite or yellow. The white man has been first in the field and holds the\r\ncentral colored zone between two strong bases, north and south, where his\r\ntenure is the unimpeachable title of race. The yellow man has to conquer\r\nevery step, though he has already acquired footholds and has behind him\r\nthe welling reservoirs of Asia. Nevertheless, white victory in Latin\r\nAmerica is sure--if internecine discord does not rob the white world of\r\nits strength. In Latin America, as in Africa, therefore, the whites must\r\nstand fast--and stand together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART II_\r\n\r\nTHE EBBING TIDE OF WHITE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE FLOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world-wide expansion of the white race during the four centuries\r\nbetween 1500 and 1900 is the most prodigious phenomenon in all recorded\r\nhistory. In my opening pages I sketched both the magnitude of this\r\nexpansion and its ethnic and political implications. I there showed that\r\nthe white stocks together constitute the most numerous single branch of\r\nthe human species, nearly one-third of all the human souls on earth to-day\r\nbeing whites. I also showed that white men racially occupy four-tenths of\r\nthe entire habitable land-area of the globe, while nearly nine-tenths of\r\nthis area is under white political control. Such a situation is\r\nunprecedented. Never before has a race acquired such combined\r\npreponderance of numbers and dominion.\r\n\r\nThis white expansion becomes doubly interesting when we realize how sudden\r\nwas its inception and how rapid its evolution. A single decade before the\r\nvoyage of Columbus, he would have been a bold prophet who should have\r\npredicted this high destiny. At the close of the fifteenth century the\r\nwhite race was confined to western and central Europe, together with\r\nScandinavia and the northwestern parts of European Russia. The total white\r\nrace-area was then not much over 2,000,000 square miles--barely one-tenth\r\nits area to-day. And in numbers the proportion was almost as unfavorable.\r\nAt that moment (say, A. D. 1480) England could muster only about 2,000,000\r\ninhabitants, the entire population of the British Isles not much exceeding\r\n3,000,000 souls. To be sure, the continent was relatively better peopled.\r\nStill, the population of Europe in 1480 was probably not one-sixth that of\r\n1914.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, population had dwindled notably in the preceding one hundred\r\nand fifty years. During the fourteenth century Europe had been hideously\r\nscourged by the \"Black Death\" (bubonic plague), which carried off fully\r\none-half of its inhabitants, while thereafter a series of great wars had\r\ndestroyed immense numbers of people. These losses had not been repaired.\r\nMediaeval society was a static, equilibrated affair, which did not favor\r\nrapid human multiplication. In fact, European life had been intensive and\r\nrecessive ever since the fall of the Roman Empire a thousand years before.\r\nEurope's one mediaeval attempt at expansion (the Crusades) had utterly\r\nfailed. In fact, far from expanding, white Europe had been continuously\r\nassailed by brown and yellow Asia. Beginning with the Huns in the last\r\ndays of Rome, continuing with the Arabs, and ending with the Mongols and\r\nOttoman Turks, Europe had undergone a millennium of Asiatic aggression;\r\nand though Europe had substantially maintained its freedom, many of its\r\noutlying marches had fallen under Asiatic domination. In 1480, for\r\nexample, the Turk was marching triumphantly across southeastern Europe,\r\nembryonic Russia was a Tartar dependency, while the Moor still clung to\r\nsouthern Spain.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for the white race at the close of the fifteenth century thus\r\nseemed gloomy rather than bright. With a stationary or declining\r\npopulation, exposed to the assaults of powerful external foes, and racked\r\nby internal pains betokening the demise of the mediaeval order, white\r\nEurope's future appeared a far from happy one.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in two short years, all was changed. In 1492 Columbus discovered\r\nAmerica, and in 1494 Vasco da Gama, doubling Africa, found the way to\r\nIndia. The effect of these discoveries cannot be overestimated. We can\r\nhardly conceive how our mediaeval forefathers viewed the ocean. To them the\r\nocean was a numbing, constricting presence; the abode of darkness and\r\nhorror. No wonder mediaeval Europe was static, since it faced on ruthless,\r\naggressive Asia, and backed on nowhere. Then, in the twinkling of an eye,\r\ndead-end Europe became mistress of the ocean--and thereby mistress of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nNo such strategical opportunity had, in fact, ever been vouchsafed. From\r\nclassic times down to the end of the fifteenth century, white Europe had\r\nconfronted only the most martial and enterprising of Asiatics. With such\r\npeoples war and trade had alike to be conducted on practically equal\r\nterms, and by frontal assault no decisive victory could be won. But, after\r\nthe great discoveries, the white man could flank his old opponents. Whole\r\nnew worlds peopled by primitive races were unmasked, where the white man's\r\nweapons made victory certain, and whence he could draw stores of wealth to\r\nquicken his home life and initiate a progress that would soon place him\r\nimmeasurably above his once-dreaded assailants.\r\n\r\nAnd the white man proved worthy of his opportunity. His inherent racial\r\naptitudes had been stimulated by his past. The hard conditions of mediaeval\r\nlife had disciplined him to adversity and had weeded him by natural\r\nselection. The hammer of Asiatic invasion, clanging for a thousand years\r\non the brown-yellow anvil, had tempered the iron of Europe into the finest\r\nsteel. The white man could think, could create, could fight superlatively\r\nwell. No wonder that redskins and negroes feared and adored him as a god,\r\nwhile the somnolent races of the Farther East, stunned by this strange\r\napparition rising from the pathless ocean, offered no effective\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nThus began the swarming of the whites, like bees from the hive, to the\r\nuttermost ends of the earth. And, in return, Europe was quickened to\r\nintenser vitality. Goods, tools, ideas, men: all were produced at an\r\nunprecedented rate. So, by action and reaction, white progress grew by\r\nleaps and bounds. The Spanish and Portuguese pioneers presently showed\r\nsigns of lassitude, but the northern nations--even more vigorous and\r\naudacious--instantly sprang to the front and carried forward the proud\r\noriflamme of white expansion and world-dominion. For four hundred years\r\nthe pace never slackened, and at the close of the nineteenth century the\r\nwhite man stood the indubitable master of the world.\r\n\r\nNow four hundred years of unbroken triumph naturally bred in the white\r\nrace an instinctive belief that its expansion would continue indefinitely,\r\nleading automatically to ever higher and more splendid destinies. Before\r\nthe Russo-Japanese War of 1904 the thought that white expansion could be\r\nstayed, much less reversed, never entered the head of one white man in a\r\nthousand. Why should it, since centuries of experience had taught the\r\nexact contrary? The settlement of America, Australasia, and Siberia, where\r\nthe few colored aborigines vanished like smoke before the white advance;\r\nthe conquest of brown Asia and the partition of Africa, where colored\r\nmillions bowed with only sporadic resistance to mere handfuls of whites;\r\nboth sets of phenomena combined to persuade the white man that he was\r\ninvincible, and that the colored types would everywhere give way before\r\nhim and his civilization. The continued existence of dense colored\r\npopulations in the tropics was ascribed to climate; and even in the\r\ntropics it was assumed that whites would universally form a governing\r\ncaste, directing by virtue of higher intelligence and more resolute will,\r\nand exploiting natural resources to the incalculable profit of the whole\r\nwhite race. Indeed, some persons believed that the tropics would become\r\navailable for white settlement as soon as science had mastered tropical\r\ndiseases and had prescribed an adequate hygiene.\r\n\r\nThis uncritical optimism, suggested by experience, was fortified by\r\nill-assimilated knowledge. During the closing decades of the past century,\r\nnot only were biology and economics less advanced than to-day, but they\r\nwere also infinitely less widely understood, exact knowledge being\r\nconfined to academic circles. The general public had only a vulgarized\r\nsmattering, mostly crystallizing about catchwords into which men read\r\ntheir prepossessions and their prejudices. For instance: biologists had\r\nrecently formulated the law of the \"Survival of the Fittest.\" This sounded\r\nvery well. Accordingly, the public, in conformity with the prevailing\r\noptimism, promptly interpreted \"fittest\" as synonymous with \"best,\" in\r\nutter disregard of the grim truth that by \"fittest\" nature denotes only\r\nthe type best adapted to existing conditions of environment, and that if\r\nthe environment favors a low type, this low type (unless humanly\r\nprevented) will win, regardless of all other considerations. So again with\r\neconomics. A generation ago relatively few persons realized that\r\nlow-standard men would drive out high-standard men as inevitably as bad\r\nmoney drives out good, no matter what the results to society and the\r\nfuture of mankind. These are but two instances of that shallow, cock-sure\r\nnineteenth-century optimism, based upon ignorance and destined to be so\r\nswiftly and tragically disillusioned.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the moment, ignorance was bliss. Accordingly, the _fin de\r\nsiecle_ white world, having partitioned Africa and fairly well dominated\r\nbrown Asia, prepared to extend its sway over the one portion of the\r\ncolored world which had hitherto escaped subjection--the yellow Far East.\r\nMen began speaking glibly of \"manifest destiny\" or piously of \"the white\r\nman's burden.\" European publicists wrote didactically on \"the break-up of\r\nChina,\" while Russia, bestriding Siberia, dipped behemoth paws in Pacific\r\nwaters and eyed Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATEGORIES OF WHITE WORLD-SUPREMACY]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the white world's confident, aggressive temper at the close of\r\nthe last century. To be sure, voices were occasionally raised warning that\r\nall was not well. Such were the writings of Professor Pearson and Meredith\r\nTownsend. But the white world gave these Cassandras the reception always\r\naccorded prophets of evil in joyous times--it ignored them or laughed them\r\nto scorn. In fact, few of the prophets displayed Pearson's immediate\r\ncertainty. Most of them qualified their prophecies with the comforting\r\nassurance that the ills predicted were relatively remote.\r\n\r\nMeredith Townsend is a good case in point. The reader may recall his\r\nprophecy of white expulsion from Asia, quoted in my second chapter.[95]\r\nThat prophecy occurs in the preface to the fourth edition, published in\r\n1911, and written in the light of the Russo-Japanese War. Now, of course,\r\nMr. Townsend's main thesis--Europe's inability permanently to master and\r\nassimilate Asia--had been elaborated by him long before the close of the\r\nnineteenth century. Nevertheless, the preface to the fourth edition speaks\r\nof Europe's failure to conquer Asia as absolute and eviction from present\r\nholdings as probable within a relatively short time; whereas, in his\r\noriginal introduction, written in 1899, he foresaw a great European\r\nassault upon Asia, which would probably succeed and from which Asia would\r\nshake itself free only after the lapse of more than a century.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mr. Townsend's words of 1899 so exactly portray white confidence\r\nat that moment that I cannot do better than quote him. His object in\r\npublishing his book is, he says, \"to make Asia stand out clearer in\r\nEnglish eyes, because it is evident to me that the white races under the\r\npressure of an entirely new impulse are about to renew their periodic\r\nattempt to conquer or at least to dominate that vast continent.... So\r\ngrand is the prize that failures will not daunt the Europeans, still less\r\nalter their conviction. If these movements follow historic lines they will\r\nrecur for a time upon a constantly ascending scale, each repulse eliciting\r\na greater effort, until at last Asia like Africa is 'partitioned,' that\r\nis, each section is left at the disposal of some white people. If Europe\r\ncan avoid internal war, or war with a much-aggrandized America, she will\r\nby A. D. 2000 be mistress in Asia, and at liberty, as her people think, to\r\nenjoy.\"[96] If the reader will compare these lines with Mr. Townsend's\r\n1911 judgment, he will get a good idea of the momentous change wrought in\r\nwhite minds by Asia's awakening during the first decade of the twentieth\r\ncentury as typified by the Russo-Japanese War.\r\n\r\n1900 was, indeed, the high-water mark of the white tide which had been\r\nflooding for four hundred years. At that moment the white man stood on the\r\npinnacle of his prestige and power. Pass four short years, and the flash\r\nof the Japanese guns across the murky waters of Port Arthur harbor\r\nrevealed to a startled world--the beginning of the ebb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE EBB\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Japanese War is one of those landmarks in human history whose\r\nsignificance increases with the lapse of time. That war was momentous, not\r\nonly for what it did, but even more for what it revealed. The legend of\r\nwhite invincibility was shattered, the veil of prestige that draped white\r\ncivilization was torn aside, and the white world's manifold ills were laid\r\nbare for candid examination.\r\n\r\nOf course previous blindness to the trend of things had not been\r\nuniversal. The white world had had its Cassandras, while keen-sighted\r\nAsiatics had discerned symptoms of white weakness. Nevertheless, so\r\nimposing was the white world's aspect and so unbroken its triumphant\r\nprogress that these seers had been a small and discredited minority. The\r\nmass of mankind, white and non-white alike, remained oblivious to signs of\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThis, after all, was but natural. Not only had the white advance been\r\ncontinuous, but its tempo had been ever increasing. The nineteenth\r\ncentury, in particular, witnessed an unprecedented outburst of white\r\nactivity. We have already surveyed white territorial gains, both as to\r\narea of settlement and sphere of political control. But along many other\r\nlines white expansion was equally remarkable. White race-increase--the\r\nbasis of all else--was truly phenomenal. In the year 1500 the white race\r\n(then confined to Europe) could not have numbered more than 70,000,000. In\r\n1800 the population of Europe was 150,000,000, while the whites living\r\noutside Europe numbered over 10,000,000. The white race had thus a trifle\r\nmore than doubled its numbers in three centuries. But in the year 1900 the\r\npopulation of Europe was nearly 450,000,000, while the extra-European\r\nwhites numbered fully 100,000,000. Thus the whites had increased threefold\r\nin the European homeland, while in the new areas of settlement outside\r\nEurope they had increased tenfold. The total number of whites at the end\r\nof the nineteenth century was thus nearly 550,000,000--a gain in numbers\r\nof almost 400,000,000, or over 400 per cent. This spelled an increase six\r\ntimes as great as that of the preceding three centuries.\r\n\r\nWhite race-growth is most strikingly exemplified by the increase of its\r\nmost expansive and successful branch--the Anglo-Saxons. In 1480, as\r\nalready seen, the population of England proper was not much over\r\n2,000,000. Of course this figure was abnormally low even for mediaeval\r\ntimes, it being due to the terrible vital losses of the Wars of the Roses,\r\nthen drawing to a close. A century later, under Elizabeth, the population\r\nof England had risen to 4,000,000. In 1900 the population of England was\r\n31,000,000, and in 1910 it was 35,000,000, the population of the British\r\nIsles at the latter date being 45,500,000. But in the intervening\r\ncenturies British blood had migrated to the ends of the earth, so that the\r\ntotal number of Anglo-Saxons in the world to-day cannot be much less than\r\n100,000,000. This figure includes Scotch and Scotch-Irish strains (which\r\nare of course identical with English in the Anglo-Saxon sense), and adopts\r\nthe current estimate that some 50,000,000 of people in the United States\r\nare predominantly of Anglo-Saxon origin. Thus, in four centuries, the\r\nAnglo-Saxons multiplied between forty and fifty fold.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious increase of the white race during the nineteenth century\r\nwas due not only to territorial expansion but even more to those\r\nastounding triumphs of science and invention which gave the race\r\nunprecedented mastery over the resources of nature. This material advance\r\nis usually known as the \"industrial revolution.\" The industrial revolution\r\nbegan in the later decades of the eighteenth century, but it matured\r\nduring the first half of the nineteenth century, when it swiftly and\r\nutterly transformed the face of things.\r\n\r\nThis transformation was, indeed, absolutely unprecedented in the world's\r\nhistory. Hitherto man's material progress had been a gradual evolution.\r\nWith the exception of gunpowder, he had tapped no new sources of material\r\nenergy since very ancient times. The horse-drawn mail-coach of our\r\ngreat-grandfathers was merely a logical elaboration of the horse-drawn\r\nEgyptian chariot; the wind-driven clipper-ship traced its line unbroken to\r\nUlysses's lateen bark before Troy; while industry still relied on the\r\nbrawn of man and beast or upon the simple action of wind and waterfall.\r\nSuddenly all was changed. Steam, electricity, petrol, the Hertzian wave,\r\nharnessed nature's hidden powers, conquered distance, and shrunk the\r\nterrestrial globe to the measure of human hands. Man entered a new\r\nmaterial world, differing not merely in degree but in kind from that of\r\nprevious generations.\r\n\r\nWhen I say \"Man,\" I mean, so far as the nineteenth century was concerned,\r\nthe white man. It was the white man's brain which had conceived all this,\r\nand it was the white man alone who at first reaped the benefits. The two\r\noutstanding features of the new order were the rise of machine industry\r\nwith its incalculable acceleration of mass-production, and the correlative\r\ndevelopment of cheap and rapid transportation. Both these factors favored\r\na prodigious increase in population, particularly in Europe, since Europe\r\nbecame the workshop of the world. In fact, during the nineteenth century,\r\nEurope was transformed from a semi-rural continent into a swarming hive of\r\nindustry, gorged with goods, capital, and men, pouring forth its wares to\r\nthe remotest corners of the earth, and drawing thence fresh stores of raw\r\nmaterial for new fabrication and exchange. The amount of wealth amassed by\r\nthe white world in general and by Europe in particular since the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century is simply incalculable. Some faint conception of\r\nit can be gathered from the growth of world-trade. In the year 1818 the\r\nentire volume of international commerce was valued at only $2,000,000,000.\r\nIn other words, after countless millenniums of human life upon our globe,\r\nman had been able to produce only that relatively modest volume of\r\nworld-exchange. In 1850 the volume of world-trade had grown to\r\n$4,000,000,000. In 1900 it had increased to $20,000,000,000, and in 1913\r\nit swelled to the inconceivable total of $40,000,000,000--a twentyfold\r\nincrease in a short hundred years.\r\n\r\nSuch were the splendid achievements of nineteenth-century civilization.\r\nBut there was a seamy side to this cloth of gold. The vices of our age\r\nhave been portrayed by a thousand censorious pens, and there is no need\r\nhere to recapitulate them. They can mostly be summed up by the word\r\n\"Materialism.\" That absorption in material questions and neglect of\r\nidealistic values which characterized the nineteenth century has been\r\nvariously accounted for. But, after all, was it not primarily due to the\r\nprofound disturbance caused by drastic environmental change? Civilized man\r\nhad just entered a new material world, differing not merely in degree but\r\nin kind from that of his ancestors. It is a scientific truism that every\r\nliving organism, in order to survive, must adapt itself to its\r\nenvironment. Therefore any change of environment must evoke an immediate\r\nreadjustment on the part of the organism, and the more pronounced the\r\nenvironmental change, the more rapid and thoroughgoing the organic\r\nreadjustment must be. Above all, speed is essential. Nature brooks no\r\ndelay, and the disharmonic organism must attune itself or perish.\r\n\r\nNow, is not readaptation precisely the problem with which civilized man\r\nhas been increasingly confronted for the past hundred years? No one surely\r\ncan deny that our present environment differs vastly from that of our\r\nancestors. But if this be so, the necessity for profound and rapid\r\nadaptation becomes equally true. In fact, the race has instinctively\r\nsensed this necessity, and has bent its best energies to the task,\r\nparticularly on the materialistic side. That was only natural. The\r\npioneer's preoccupation with material matters in opening up new country is\r\nself-evident, but what is not so generally recognized is the fact that\r\nnineteenth-century Europe and the eastern United States are in many\r\nrespects environmentally \"newer\" than remote backwoods settlements.\r\n\r\nOf course the changed character of our civilization called for idealistic\r\nadaptations no less sweeping. These were neglected, because their\r\nnecessity was not so compellingly patent. Indeed, man was distinctly\r\nattached to his existing idealistic outfit, to the elaboration of which he\r\nhad so assiduously devoted himself in former days, and which had fairly\r\nserved the requirements of his simpler past. Therefore nineteenth-century\r\nman concentrated intensively, exclusively upon materialistic problems,\r\nfeeling that he could thus concentrate because he believed that the\r\nidealistic conquests of preceding epochs had given him sound moral bases\r\nupon which to build the new material edifice.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that which had at first been merely a means to an end\r\npresently became an end in itself. Losing sight of his idealisms,\r\nnineteenth-century man evolved a thoroughly materialistic philosophy. The\r\nupshot was a warped, one-sided development which quickly revealed its\r\nunsoundness. The fact that man was much less culpable for his errors than\r\nmany moralists aver is quite beside the point, so far as consequences are\r\nconcerned. Nature takes no excuses. She demands results, and when these\r\nare not forthcoming she inexorably inflicts her penalties.\r\n\r\nAs the nineteenth century drew toward its close the symptoms of a profound\r\n_malaise_ appeared on every side. Even those most fundamental of all\r\nfactors, the vitality and quality of the race, were not immune. Vital\r\nstatistics began to display features highly disquieting to thoughtful\r\nminds. The most striking of these phenomena was the declining birth-rate\r\nwhich affected nearly all the white nations toward the close of the\r\nnineteenth century and which in France resulted in a virtually stationary\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nOf course the mere fact of a lessened birth-rate, taken by itself, is not\r\nthe unmixed evil which many persons assume. Man's potential reproductive\r\ncapacity, like that of all other species, is very great. In fact, the\r\nwhole course of biological progress has been marked by a steady checking\r\nof that reproductive exuberance which ran riot at the beginning of life on\r\nearth. As Havelock Ellis well says: \"Of one minute organism it is\r\nestimated that, if its reproduction were not checked by death or\r\ndestruction, in thirty days it would form a mass a million times larger\r\nthan the sun. The conger-eel lays 15,000,000 eggs, and if they all grew\r\nup, and reproduced themselves on the same scale, in two years the whole\r\nsea would become a wriggling mass of fish. As we approach the higher forms\r\nof life reproduction gradually dies down. The animals nearest to man\r\nproduce few offspring, but they surround them with parental care, until\r\nthey are able to lead independent lives with a fair chance of surviving.\r\nThe whole process may be regarded as a mechanism for slowly subordinating\r\nquantity to quality, and so promoting the evolution of life to ever higher\r\nstages.\"[97]\r\n\r\nWhile man's reproductive power is slight from the standpoint of bacteria\r\nand conger-eels, it is yet far from negligible, as is shown by the\r\nbirth-rate of the less-advanced human types at all times, and by the\r\nbirth-rate of the higher types under exceptionally favorable\r\ncircumstances. The nineteenth century was one of these favorable\r\noccasions. In the new areas of settlement outside Europe, vast regions\r\npractically untenanted by colored competitors invited the white colonists\r\nto increase and multiply; while Europe itself, though historically \"old\r\ncountry,\" was so transformed environmentally by the industrial revolution\r\nthat it suddenly became capable of supporting a much larger population\r\nthan heretofore. By the close of the century, however, the most pressing\r\neconomic stimuli to rapid multiplication had waned in Europe and in many\r\nof the race dependencies. Therefore the rate of increase, even under the\r\nmost favorable biological circumstances, should have shown a decline.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was that this diminishing human output was of less and less\r\nbiological value. Wherever one looked in the white world, it was precisely\r\nthose peoples of highest genetic worth whose birth-rate fell off most\r\nsharply, while within the ranks of the several peoples it was those social\r\nclasses containing the highest proportion of able strains which were\r\ncontributing the smallest quotas to the population. Everywhere the better\r\ntypes (on which the future of the race depends) were numerically\r\nstationary or dwindling, while conversely, the lower types were gaining\r\nground, their birth-rate showing relatively slight diminution.\r\n\r\nThis \"disgenic\" trend, so ominous for the future of the race, is a\r\nmelancholy commonplace of our time, and many efforts have been made to\r\nmeasure its progress in economic or social terms. One of the most striking\r\nand easily measured examples, however, is furnished by the category of\r\nrace. As explained in the Introduction, the white race divides into three\r\nmain sub-species--the Nordics, the Alpines, and the Mediterraneans. All\r\nthree are good stocks, ranking in genetic worth well above the various\r\ncolored races. However, there seems to be no question that the Nordic is\r\nfar and away the most valuable type; standing, indeed, at the head of the\r\nwhole human genus. As Madison Grant well expresses it, the Nordic is \"The\r\nGreat Race.\"\r\n\r\nNow it is the Nordics who are most affected by the disgenic aspects of our\r\ncivilization. In the newer areas of white settlement like our Pacific\r\ncoast or the Canadian Northwest, to be sure, the Nordics even now thrive\r\nand multiply. But in all those regions which typify the transformation of\r\nthe industrial revolution, the Nordics do not fit into the altered\r\nenvironment as well as either Alpines or Mediterraneans, and hence tend to\r\ndisappear. Before the industrial revolution the Nordic's chief eliminator\r\nwas war. His pre-eminent fighting ability, together with the position of\r\nleadership which he had generally acquired, threw on his shoulders the\r\nbrunt of battle and exposed him to the greatest losses, whereas the more\r\nstolid Alpine and the less robust Mediterranean stayed at home and\r\nreproduced their kind. The chronic turmoil of both the mediaeval and modern\r\nperiods imposed a perpetual drain on the Nordic stock, while the era of\r\ndiscovery and colonization which began with the sixteenth century further\r\ndepleted the Nordic ranks in Europe, since it was adventurous Nordics who\r\nformed the overwhelming majority of explorers and pioneers to new lands.\r\nThus, even at the end of the eighteenth century, Europe was much less\r\nNordic than it had been a thousand years before.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, down to the close of the eighteenth century, the Nordics\r\nsuffered from no other notable handicaps than war and migration, and even\r\nenjoyed some marked advantages. Being a high type, the Nordic is naturally\r\na \"high standard\" man. He requires healthful living conditions, and\r\nquickly pines when deprived of good food, fresh air, and exercise. Down to\r\nthe close of the eighteenth century, Europe was predominantly\r\nagricultural. In cool northern and central Europe, therefore, environment\r\nactually favored the big, blond Nordics, especially as against the\r\nslighter, less muscular Mediterranean; while in the hotter south the\r\nNordic upper class, being the rulers, were protected from field labor, and\r\nthus survived as an aristocracy. In peaceful times, therefore, the Nordics\r\nmultiplied and repaired the gaps wrought by proscription and war.\r\n\r\nThe industrial revolution, however, profoundly modified this state of\r\nthings. Europe was transformed from an agricultural to an urbanized,\r\nindustrial area. Numberless cities and manufacturing centres grew up,\r\nwhere men were close packed and were subjected to all the evils of\r\ncongested living. Of course such conditions are not ideal for any stock.\r\nNevertheless, the Nordic suffered more than any one else. The cramped\r\nfactory and the crowded city weeded out the big, blond Nordic with\r\nportentous rapidity, whereas the little brunet Mediterranean, in\r\nparticular, adapted himself to the operative's bench or the clerk's stool,\r\nprospered--and reproduced his kind.\r\n\r\nThe result of these new handicaps, combined with the continuance of the\r\ntraditional handicaps (war and migration), has been a startling decrease\r\nof Nordics all over Europe throughout the nineteenth century, with a\r\ncorresponding resurgence of the Alpine, and still more of the\r\nMediterranean, elements. In the United States it has been the same story.\r\nOur country, originally settled almost exclusively by Nordics, was toward\r\nthe close of the nineteenth century invaded by hordes of immigrant Alpines\r\nand Mediterraneans, not to mention Asiatic elements like Levantines and\r\nJews. As a result, the Nordic native American has been crowded out with\r\namazing rapidity by these swarming, prolific aliens, and after two short\r\ngenerations he has in many of our urban areas become almost extinct.\r\n\r\nThe racial displacements induced by a changed economic or social\r\nenvironment are, indeed, almost incalculable. Contrary to the popular\r\nbelief, nothing is more _unstable_ than the ethnic make-up of a people.\r\nAbove all, there is no more absurd fallacy than the shibboleth of the\r\n\"melting-pot.\" As a matter of fact, the melting-pot may mix but does not\r\nmelt. Each race-type, formed ages ago, and \"set\" by millenniums of\r\nisolation and inbreeding, is a stubbornly persistent entity. Each type\r\npossesses a special set of characters: not merely the physical characters\r\nvisible to the naked eye, but moral, intellectual, and spiritual\r\ncharacters as well. All these characters are transmitted substantially\r\nunchanged from generation to generation. To be sure, where members of the\r\nsame race-stock intermarry (as English and Swedish Nordics, or French and\r\nBritish Mediterraneans), there seems to be genuine amalgamation. In most\r\nother cases, however, the result is not a blend but a mechanical mixture.\r\nWhere the parent stocks are very diverse, as in matings between whites,\r\nnegroes, and Amerindians, the offspring is a mongrel--a walking chaos, so\r\nconsumed by his jarring heredities that he is quite worthless. We have\r\nalready viewed the mongrel and his works in Latin America.\r\n\r\nSuch are the two extremes. Where intermarriage takes place between stocks\r\nrelatively near together, as in crossings between the main divisions of\r\nthe white species, the result may not be bad, and is sometimes distinctly\r\ngood. Nevertheless, there is no true amalgamation. The different\r\nrace-characters remain distinct in the mixed offspring. If the race-types\r\nhave generally intermarried, the country is really occupied by two or more\r\nraces, the races always tending to sort themselves out again as pure types\r\nby Mendelian inheritance. Now one of these race-types will be favored by\r\nthe environment, and it will accordingly tend to gain at the other's\r\nexpense, while conversely the other types will tend to be bred out and to\r\ndisappear. Sometimes a modification of the environment through social\r\nchanges will suddenly reverse this process and will penalize a hitherto\r\nfavored type. We then witness a \"resurgence,\" or increase, of the\r\npreviously submerged element.\r\n\r\nA striking instance of this is going on in England. England is inhabited\r\nby two race-stocks--Nordics and Mediterraneans. Down to the eighteenth\r\ncentury, England, being an agricultural country with a cool climate,\r\nfavored the Nordics, and but for the Nordic handicaps of war and\r\nmigration the Mediterraneans might have been entirely eliminated. Two\r\nhundred years ago the Mediterranean element in England was probably very\r\nsmall. The industrial revolution, however, reversed the selective process,\r\nand to-day the small, dark types in England increase noticeably with every\r\ngeneration. The swart \"cockney\" is a resurgence of the primitive\r\nMediterranean stock, and is probably a faithful replica of his ancestors\r\nof Neolithic times.\r\n\r\nSuch was the ominous \"seamy side\" of nineteenth-century civilization. The\r\nregressive trend was, in fact, a vicious circle. An ill-balanced, faulty\r\nenvironment penalized the superior strains and favored the inferior types;\r\nwhile, conversely, the impoverishing race-stocks, drained of their\r\ngeniuses and overloading with dullards and degenerates, were increasingly\r\nunable to evolve environmental remedies.\r\n\r\nThus, by action and reaction, the situation grew steadily worse,\r\ndisclosing its parlous state by numberless symptoms of social ill-health.\r\nAll the unlovely _fin de siecle_ phenomena, such as the decay of ideals,\r\nrampant materialism, political disruption, social unrest, and the\r\n\"decadence\" of art and literature, were merely manifestations of the same\r\nbasic ills.\r\n\r\nOf course a thoughtful minority, undazzled by the prevalent optimism,\r\npointed out evils and suggested remedies. Unfortunately these \"remedies\"\r\nwere superficial, because the reformers confused manifestations with\r\ncauses and combated symptoms instead of fighting the disease. For\r\nexample: the white world's troubles were widely ascribed to the loss of\r\nits traditional ideals, especially the decay of religious faith. But, as\r\nthe Belgian sociologist Rene Gerard acutely remarks, \"to reason in this\r\nmanner is, we think, to mistake the effect for the cause. To believe that\r\nphilosophic and religious doctrines create morals and civilizations is a\r\nseductive error, but a fatal one. To transplant the beliefs and the\r\ninstitutions of a people to new regions in the hope of transplanting\r\nthither their virtues and their civilization as well is the vainest of\r\nfollies.... The greater or less degree of vigor in a people depends on the\r\npower of its vital instinct, of its greater or less faculty for adapting\r\nitself to and dominating the conditions of the moment. When the vital\r\ninstinct of a people is healthy, it readily suggests to the people the\r\nreligious and moral doctrines which assure its survival. It is not,\r\ntherefore, because a people possesses a definite belief that it is healthy\r\nand vigorous, but rather because the people is healthy and vigorous that\r\nit adopts or invents the belief which is useful to itself. In this way, it\r\nis not because it ceases to believe that it falls into decay, it is\r\nbecause it is in decay that it abandons the fertile dream of its ancestors\r\nwithout replacing this by a new dream, equally fortifying and creative of\r\nenergy.\"[98]\r\n\r\nThus we return once more to the basic principle of race. For what is\r\n\"vital instinct\" but the imperious urge of superior heredity? As Madison\r\nGrant well says: \"The lesson is always the same, namely, that race is\r\neverything. Without race there can be nothing except the slave wearing his\r\nmaster's clothes, stealing his master's proud name, adopting his master's\r\ntongue, and living in the crumbling ruins of his master's palace.\"[99]\r\n\r\nThe disastrous consequences of failure to realize this basic truth is\r\nnowhere more strikingly exemplified than in the field of white\r\nworld-politics during the half-century preceding the Great War. That\r\nperiod was dominated by two antithetical schools of political thinking:\r\nnational-imperialism and internationalism. Swayed by the ill-balanced\r\nspirit of the times, both schools developed extremist tendencies; the\r\nformer producing such monstrous aberrations as Pan-Germanism and\r\nPan-Slavism, the latter evolving almost equally vicious concepts like\r\ncosmopolitanism and proletarianism. The adherents of these rival schools\r\ncombated one another and wrangled among themselves. They both disregarded\r\nthe basic significance of race, together with its immediate corollary, the\r\nessential solidarity of the white world.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, white solidarity has been one of the great constants\r\nof history. For ages the white peoples have possessed a true \"symbiosis\"\r\nor common life, ceaselessly mingling their bloods and exchanging their\r\nideas. Accordingly, the various white nations which are the race's\r\npolitical expression may be regarded as so many planets gravitating about\r\nthe sun of a common civilization. No such sustained and intimate\r\nrace-solidarity has ever before been recorded in human annals. Not even\r\nthe solidarity of the yellow peoples is comparable in scope.\r\n\r\nOf course the white world's internal frictions have been legion, and at\r\ncertain times these frictions have become so acute that white men have\r\nbeen led to disregard or even to deny their fundamental unity. This is\r\nperhaps also because white solidarity is so pervasive that we _live in\r\nit_, and thus ordinarily do not perceive it any more than we do the air we\r\nbreathe. Should white men ever really lose their instinct of\r\nrace-solidarity, they would asphyxiate racially as swiftly and surely as\r\nthey would asphyxiate physically if the atmospheric oxygen should suddenly\r\nbe withdrawn. However, down to 1914 at least, the white world never came\r\nwithin measurable distance of this fatal possibility. On the contrary, the\r\nwhite peoples were continually expressing their fundamental solidarity by\r\nvarious unifying concepts like the \"Pax Romana\" of antiquity, the \"Civitas\r\nDei\" or Christian commonwealth of the Middle Ages, and the \"European\r\nConcert\" of nineteenth-century diplomacy.\r\n\r\nIt was typical of the _malaise_ which was overtaking the white world that\r\nthe close of the nineteenth century should have witnessed an ominous\r\nignoring of white solidarity; that national-imperialists should have\r\nbreathed mutual slaughter while internationalists caressed visions of\r\n\"human solidarity\" culminating in universal race-amalgamation; lastly,\r\nthat Asia's incipient revolt against white supremacy, typified by the\r\nRusso-Japanese War, should have found zealous white sponsors and abetters.\r\n\r\nNothing, indeed, better illustrates the white world's unsoundness at the\r\nbeginning of the present century than its reaction to the Russo-Japanese\r\nconflict. The tremendous significance of that event was no more lost upon\r\nthe whites than it was upon the colored peoples. Most far-seeing white men\r\nrecognized it as an omen of evil import for their race-future. And yet,\r\neven in the first access of apprehension, these same persons generally\r\nadmitted that they saw no prospect of healing, constructive action to\r\nremedy the ills which were driving the white world along the downward\r\npath. Analyzing the possibility of Europe's presenting a common front to\r\nthe perils disclosed by the Japanese victories, the French publicist Rene\r\nPinon sadly concluded in the negative, believing that political passions,\r\nsocial hates, and national rivalries would speak louder than the general\r\ninterest. \"Contemporary Europe,\" he wrote, in 1905, \"is probably not ready\r\nto receive and understand the lesson of the war. What are the examples of\r\nhistory to those gigantic commercial houses, uneasy for their New Year's\r\nbalances, which are our modern nations? It is in the nature of States\r\nfounded on mercantilism to content themselves with a hand-to-mouth policy,\r\nwithout general views or idealism, satisfied with immediate gains and\r\nunable to prepare against a distant future.\r\n\r\n\"Whence, in the Europe of to-day, could come the principle of an\r\n_entente_, and on what could it be based? Too many divergent interests,\r\ntoo many rival ambitions, too many festering hates, too many 'dead who\r\nspeak,' are present to stifle the voice of Europe's conscience.\r\n\r\n\"However menacing the external danger, we fear that political rancors\r\nwould not down; that the enemy from without would find accomplices, or at\r\nleast unconscious auxiliaries, within. Far more than in its regiments and\r\nbattleships, the power of Japan lies in our discords, in the absence of an\r\nideal capable of lifting the European peoples above the daily pursuit of\r\nimmediate interests, capable of stirring their hearts with the thrill of a\r\ncommon emotion. The true 'Yellow Peril' lies within us.\"[100]\r\n\r\nRene Pinon was a true prophet. Not only was the \"writing on the wall\" not\r\ntaken to heart, the decade following the Russo-Japanese conflict witnessed\r\na prodigious aggravation of all the ills which had afflicted white\r\ncivilization during the nineteenth century. As if scourged by a tragic\r\nfate, the white world hurtled along the downward path, until it entered\r\nthe fell shadow of--the modern Peloponnesian War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN PELOPONNESIAN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peloponnesian War was the suicide of Greek civilization. It is the\r\nsaddest page of history. In the brief Periclean epoch preceding the\r\ncatastrophe Hellas had shone forth with unparalleled splendor, and even\r\nthose wonderful achievements seemed but the prelude to still loftier\r\nheights of glory. On the eve of its self-immolation the Greek race, far\r\nfrom being exhausted, was bubbling over with exuberant vitality and\r\ncreative genius.\r\n\r\nBut the half-blown rose was nipped by the canker of discord. Jealous\r\nrivalries and mad ambitions smouldered till they burst into a consuming\r\nflame. For a generation Hellas tore itself to pieces in a delirium of\r\nfratricidal strife. And even this was not the worst. The \"peace\" which\r\nclosed the Peloponnesian War was no peace. It was a mere truce, dictated\r\nby the victors of the moment to sullen and vengeful enemies. Imposed by\r\nthe sword and infused with no healing or constructive virtue, the\r\nPeloponnesian War was but the first of a war cycle which completed\r\nHellas's ruin.\r\n\r\nThe irreparable disaster had, indeed, occurred: the gulfs of sundering\r\nhatred had become fixed, and the sentiment of Greek race-unity was\r\ndestroyed. Having lost its soul, the Greek race soon lost its body as\r\nwell. Drained of its best strains, the diminished remnant bowed to\r\nforeign masters and bastardized its blood with the hordes of inferior\r\naliens who swarmed into the land. By the time of the Roman conquest the\r\nGreeks were degenerate, and the Roman epithet \"Graeculus\" was a term of\r\ndeserved contempt.\r\n\r\nThus perished the Greeks--the fairest slip that ever budded on the tree of\r\nlife. They perished by their own hands, in the flower of their youth,\r\ncarrying with them to the grave, unborn, potencies which might have\r\nblessed and brightened the world for ages. Nature is inexorable. No living\r\nbeing stands above her law; and protozoon or demigod, if they transgress,\r\nalike must die.\r\n\r\nThe Greek tragedy should be a warning to our own day. Despite many\r\nunlikenesses, the nineteenth century was strangely reminiscent of the\r\nPericlean age. In creative energy and fecund achievement, surely, its like\r\nhad not been seen since \"the glory that was Greece,\" and the way seemed\r\nopening to yet higher destinies.\r\n\r\nBut the brilliant sunrise was presently dimmed by gathering clouds. The\r\nbirth of the twentieth century was attended with disquieting omens. The\r\nills which had afflicted the preceding epoch grew more acute,\r\nsynchronizing into an all-pervading, militant unrest. The spirit of change\r\nwas in the air. Ancient ideals and shibboleths withered before the fiery\r\nbreath of a destructive criticism, while the solid crust of tradition\r\ncracked and heaved under the premonitory tremors of volcanic forces\r\nworking far below. Everywhere were seen bursting forth increasingly acute\r\neruptions of human energy: a triumph of the dynamic over the static\r\nelements of life; a growing preference for violent and revolutionary, as\r\ncontrasted with peaceful and evolutionary, solutions, running the whole\r\npolitico-social gamut from \"Imperialism\" to \"Syndicalism.\" Everywhere\r\ncould be discerned the spirit of unrest setting the stage for the great\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nGrave disorders were simply inevitable. They might perhaps have been\r\nlocalized. They might even have taken other forms. But the ills of our\r\ncivilization were too deep-seated to have avoided grave disturbances. The\r\nPrussian plotters of \"Weltmacht\" did, indeed, precipitate the impending\r\ncrisis in its most virulent and concentrated form, yet after all they were\r\nbut sublimations of the abnormal trend of the times.\r\n\r\nThe best proof of this is the white world's acutely pathological condition\r\nduring the entire decade previous to the Great War. That fierce quest\r\nafter alliances and mad piling-up of armaments; those paroxysmal \"crises\"\r\nwhich racked diplomacy's feverish frame; those ferocious struggles which\r\ndesolated the Balkans: what were all these but symptoms denoting a\r\nconsuming disease? To-day, by contrast, we think of the Great War as\r\nhaving smitten a world basking in profound peace. What a delusion! Cast\r\nback the mind's eye, and recall how hectic was the eve of the Great War,\r\nnot merely in politics but in most other fields as well. Those opening\r\nmonths of 1914! Why, Europe seethed from end to end! When the Great War\r\nbegan, England was on the verge of civil strife, Russia was in the throes\r\nof an acute social revolt, Italy had just passed through a \"red week\"\r\nthreatening anarchy, and every European country was suffering from grave\r\ninternal disorders. It was a strange, nightmarish time, that early summer\r\nof 1914, to-day quite overshadowed by subsequent events, but which later\r\ngenerations will assign a proper place in the chain of world-history.\r\n\r\nWell, Armageddon began and ran its horrid course. With the grim chronology\r\nof those dreary years this book is not concerned. It is with the aftermath\r\nthat we here deal. And that is a sufficiently gloomy theme. The material\r\nlosses are prodigious, the vital losses appalling, while the spiritual\r\nlosses have well-nigh bankrupted the human soul.\r\n\r\nTurning first to the material losses, they are of course in the broadest\r\nsense incalculable, but approximate estimates have been made. Perhaps the\r\nbest of them is the analysis made by Professor Ernest L. Bogert, who\r\nplaces the direct costs of the war at $186,000,000,000 and the indirect\r\ncosts at $151,000,000,000, thus arriving at the stupendous total of\r\n$337,000,000,000. These well-nigh inconceivable estimates still do not\r\nadequately represent the total losses, figured even in monetary terms,\r\nfor, as Professor Bogert remarks: \"The figures presented in this summary\r\nare both incomprehensible and appalling, yet even these do not take into\r\naccount the effect of the war on life, human vitality, economic\r\nwell-being, ethics, morality, or other phases of human relationships and\r\nactivities which have been disorganized and injured. It is evident from\r\nthe present disturbances in Europe that the real costs of the war cannot\r\nbe measured by the direct money outlays of the belligerents during the\r\nfive years of its duration, but that the very breakdown of modern economic\r\nsociety might be the price exacted.\"[101]\r\n\r\nYet prodigious as has been the destruction of wealth, the destruction of\r\nlife is even more serious. Wealth can sooner or later be replaced, while\r\nvital losses are, by their very nature, irreparable. Never before were\r\nsuch masses of men arrayed for mutual slaughter. During the late war\r\nnearly 60,000,000 soldiers were mobilized, and the combatants suffered\r\n33,000,000 casualties, of whom nearly 8,000,000 were killed or died of\r\ndisease, nearly 19,000,000 were wounded, and 7,000,000 taken prisoners.\r\nThe greatest sufferer was Russia, which had over 9,000,000 casualties,\r\nwhile next in order came Germany with 6,000,000 and France with 4,500,000\r\ncasualties. The British Empire had 3,000,000 casualties. America's losses\r\nwere relatively slight, our total casualties being a trifle under 300,000.\r\n\r\nAnd this is only the beginning of the story. The figures just quoted refer\r\nonly to fighting men. They take no account of the civilian population. But\r\nthe civilian losses were simply incalculable, especially in eastern Europe\r\nand the Ottoman Empire. It is estimated that for every soldier killed,\r\nfive civilians perished by hunger, exposure, disease, massacre, or\r\nheightened infant mortality. The civilian deaths in Poland and Russia are\r\nplaced at many millions, while other millions died in Turkey and Serbia\r\nthrough massacre and starvation. One item alone will give some idea of the\r\nwastage of human life during the war. The deaths beyond the normal\r\nmortality due to influenza and pneumonia induced by the war are estimated\r\nat 4,000,000. The total loss of life directly attributable to the war is\r\nprobably fully 40,000,000, while if decreased birth-rates be added the\r\ntotal would rise to nearly 50,000,000. Furthermore, so far as civilian\r\ndeaths are concerned, the terrible conditions prevailing over a great part\r\nof Europe since the close of 1918 have caused additional losses relatively\r\nas severe as those during the war years.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Europe's population has been literally decimated by the\r\nlate war is shown by the example of France. In 1914 the population of\r\nFrance was 39,700,000. From this relatively moderate population nearly\r\n8,000,000 men were mobilized during the war. Of these, nearly 1,400,000\r\nwere killed, 3,000,000 were wounded, and more than 400,000 were made\r\nprisoners. Of the wounded, between 800,000 and 900,000 were left permanent\r\nphysical wrecks. Thus fully 2,000,000 men--mostly drawn from the flower of\r\nFrench manhood--were dead or hopelessly incapacitated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the civilian population was also shrinking. Omitting the\r\ncivilian deaths in the northern departments under German occupation, the\r\nexcess of deaths over births was more than 50,000 for 1914, and averaged\r\nnearly 300,000 for the four succeeding war years. And the most alarming\r\nfeature was that these losses were mainly due, not to deaths of adults,\r\nbut to a slump in the birth-rate. French births, which had been 600,000 in\r\n1913, dropped to 315,000 in 1916 and 343,000 in 1917. All told, it seems\r\nprobable that between 1913 and 1919 the population of France diminished by\r\nalmost 3,000,000--nearly one-tenth of the entire population.\r\n\r\nFrance's vital losses are only typical of what has to a greater or less\r\nextent occurred all over Europe. The disgenic effect of the Great War is\r\nsimply appalling. The war was nothing short of a headlong plunge into\r\nwhite race-suicide. It was essentially a civil war between closely related\r\nwhite stocks; a war wherein every physical and mental effective was\r\ngathered up and hurled into a hell of lethal machinery which killed out\r\nunerringly the youngest, the bravest, and the best.\r\n\r\nEven in the first frenzied hours of August, 1914, wise men realized the\r\nhorror that stood upon the threshold. The crowd might cheer, but the\r\nreflective already mourned in prospect the losses which were in store. As\r\nthe English writer Harold Begbie then said: \"Remember this. Among the\r\nyoung conscript soldiers of Europe who will die in thousands, and perhaps\r\nmillions, are the very flower of civilization; we shall destroy brains\r\nwhich might have discovered for us in ten or twenty years easements for\r\nthe worst of human pains and solutions for the worst of social dangers. We\r\nshall blot those souls out of our common existence. We shall destroy\r\nutterly those splendid burning spirits reaching out to enlighten our\r\ndarkness. Our fathers destroyed those strange and valuable creatures whom\r\nthey called 'witches.' We are destroying the brightest of our\r\nangels.\"[102]\r\n\r\nBut it is doubtful if any of these seers realized the full price which the\r\nrace was destined to pay during more than four long, agonizing years.\r\nNever before had war shown itself such an unerring gleaner of the best\r\nracial values. As early as the summer of 1915 Mr. Will Irwin, an American\r\nwar correspondent, remarked the growing convictions among all classes,\r\nsoldiers as well as civilians, that the war was fatally impoverishing the\r\nrace. \"I have talked,\" he wrote, \"with British officers and British\r\nTommies, with English ladies of fashion and English housewives, with\r\nFrench deputies and French cabmen, and in all minds alike I find the same\r\nidea fixed--what is to become of the French race and the British race,\r\nyes, and the German race, if this thing keeps up?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Irwin then goes on to describe the cumulative process by which the\r\nfittest were selected--for death.\r\n\r\n\"I take it for granted,\" he says, \"that, in a general way, the bravest are\r\nthe best, physically and spiritually. Now, in this war of machinery, this\r\nmeat-mill, it is the bravest who lead the charges and attempt the daring\r\nfeats, and, correspondingly, the loss is greatest among those bravest.\r\n\r\n\"So much when the army gets into line. But in the conscript countries,\r\nlike France and Germany, there is a process of selection in picking the\r\narmy by which the best--speaking in general terms--go out to die, while\r\nthe weakest remain. The undersized, the undermuscled, the underbrained,\r\nthe men twisted by hereditary deformity or devitalized by hereditary\r\ndisease--they remain at home to propagate the breed. The rest--all the\r\nrest--go out to take chances.\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, as modern conscript armies are organized, it is the youngest\r\nmen who sustain the heaviest losses--the men who are not yet fathers. And\r\nfrom the point of view of the race, that is, perhaps, the most melancholy\r\nfact of all.\r\n\r\n\"All the able-bodied men between the ages of nineteen and forty-five are\r\nin the ranks. But the older men do not take many chances with death....\r\nThese European conscript armies are arranged in classes according to age,\r\nand the younger classes are the men who do most of the actual fighting.\r\nThe men in their late thirties or their forties, the 'territorials,' guard\r\nthe lines, garrison the towns, generally attend to the business of running\r\nup the supplies. When we come to gather the statistics of this war we\r\nshall find that an overwhelming majority of the dead were less than thirty\r\nyears old, and probably that the majority were under twenty-five. Now, the\r\nterritorial of forty or forty-five has usually given to the state as many\r\nchildren as he is going to give, while the man of twenty-five or under\r\nhas usually given the state no children at all.\"[103]\r\n\r\nMr. Irwin was gauging the racial cost by the criterion of youth. A leading\r\nEnglish scholar, Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, obtained equally alarming results by\r\napplying the test of genius. He analyzed the casualty lists \"filled with\r\nnames which, but for the fatal accidents of war, would certainly have been\r\nmade illustrious for splendid service to the great cause of life.... A\r\ngovernment actuated by a cold calculus of economic efficiency would have\r\nmade some provision for sheltering from the hazards of war young men on\r\nwhose exceptional intellectual powers our future progress might be thought\r\nto depend. But this has not been done, and it is impossible to estimate\r\nthe extent to which the world will be impoverished in quality by the\r\ndisappearance of so much youthful genius and talent.... The spiritual loss\r\nto the universe cannot be computed, and probably will exceed the injury\r\ninflicted on the world by the wide and protracted prevalence of the\r\ncelibate orders in the Middle Ages.\"[104]\r\n\r\nThe American biologist S. K. Humphrey did not underestimate the extent of\r\nthe slaughter of genius-bearing strains when he wrote: \"It is safe to say\r\nthat among the millions killed will be a million who are carrying\r\n_superlatively_ effective inheritances--the dependence of the race's\r\nfuture. Nothing is more absurd than the notion that these inheritances can\r\nbe replaced in a few generations by encouraging the fecundity of the\r\nsurvivors. They are gone forever. The survivors are going to reproduce\r\ntheir own less-valuable kind. Words fail to convey the appalling nature of\r\nthe loss.\"[105]\r\n\r\nIt is the same melancholy tale when we apply the test of race. Of course\r\nthe war bore heavily on all the white race-stocks, but it was the\r\nNordics--the best of all human breeds--who suffered far and away the\r\ngreatest losses. War, as we have seen, was always the Nordic's deadliest\r\nscourge, and never was this truer than in the late struggle. From the\r\nracial standpoint, indeed, Armageddon was a Nordic civil war, most of the\r\nofficers and a large proportion of the men on both sides belonging to the\r\nNordic race. Everywhere it was the same story: the Nordic went forth\r\neagerly to battle, while the more stolid Alpine and, above all, the little\r\nbrunet Mediterranean either stayed at home or even when at the front\r\nshowed less fighting spirit, took fewer chances, and oftener saved their\r\nskins.\r\n\r\nThe Great War has thus unquestionably left Europe much poorer in Nordic\r\nblood, while conversely it has relatively favored the Mediterraneans.\r\nMadison Grant well says: \"As in all wars since Roman times, from the\r\nbreeding point of view the little dark man is the final winner.\"[106]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it must be remembered that those disgenic effects which I\r\nhave been discussing refer solely to losses inflicted upon the actual\r\ncombatants. But we have already seen that for every soldier killed the war\r\ntook five civilian lives. In fact, the war's profoundly devitalizing\r\neffects upon the general population can hardly be overestimated. Those\r\neffects include not merely such obvious matters as privation and disease,\r\nbut also obscurer yet highly destructive factors like nervous shock and\r\nprolonged overstrain. To take merely one instance, consider Havelock\r\nEllis's remarks concerning \"the ever-widening circles of anguish and\r\nmisery and destitution which every fatal bullet imposes on humanity.\" He\r\nconcludes: \"It is probable that for every 10,000,000 soldiers who fall on\r\nthe field, 50,000,000 other persons at home are plunged into grief, or\r\npoverty, or some form of life-diminishing trouble.\"[107]\r\n\r\nMost serious has been the war's effect upon the children. At home, as at\r\nthe front, it is the young who have been sacrificed. The heaviest civilian\r\nlosses have come through increased infant mortality and decreased\r\nbirth-rates. The \"slaughter of the innocents\" has thus been twofold: it\r\nhas slain millions of those already alive, and it has prevented millions\r\nmore from being born or conceived. The decreased fecundity of women during\r\nthe war even under good material conditions apparently shows that war's\r\npsychological reflexes tend to induce sterility.\r\n\r\nAn Italian savant, Professor Sergi, has elaborated this hypothesis in\r\nconsiderable detail. He contends that \"war continued for a long time is\r\nthe origin of this phenomenon (relative sterility), not only in the\r\nabsolute sense of the loss of men in battle, but also through a series of\r\nspecial conditions which arise simultaneously with an unbalancing of vital\r\nprocesses and which create in the latter a complex phenomenon difficult to\r\nexamine in every one of its elements.\r\n\r\n\"The biological disturbance does not derive solely from the destruction of\r\nyoung lives, the ones best adapted to fecundity, but also from the\r\nunfavorable conditions into which a nation is unexpectedly thrown; from\r\nthese come disorders of a mental and sentimental nature, nervousness,\r\nanxiety, grief, and pain of all kinds, to which the serious economic\r\nconditions of war-time also contribute; all these things have a harmful\r\neffect on the general organic economy of nations.\"[108]\r\n\r\nFrom the combination of these losses on the battle-field and in the cradle\r\narises what the biologist Doctor Saleeby terms \"the menace of the dearth\r\nof youth.\" The European populations to-day contain an undue proportion of\r\nadults and the aged, while \"the younger generation is no longer knocking\r\nat the door. We senescents may grow old in peace; but the facts bode ill\r\nfor our national future.\"[109]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this \"dearth of youth\" will not be easily repaired. The war\r\nmay be over, but its aftermath is only a degree less unfavorable to human\r\nmultiplication, especially of the better kinds. Bad industrial conditions\r\nand the fearfully high cost of living continue to depress the birth-rate\r\nof all save the most reckless and improvident elements, whose increase is\r\na curse rather than a blessing.\r\n\r\nTo show only one of the many causes that to-day keep down the birth-rate,\r\ntake the crushing burden of taxation, which hits especially the increase\r\nof the upper classes. The London _Saturday Review_ recently explained this\r\nvery clearly when it wrote: \"From a man with L2,000 a year the\r\ntax-gatherer takes L600. The remaining L1,400, owing to the decreased\r\nvalue of money, has a purchasing power about equal to L700 a year before\r\nthe war. No young man will therefore think of marrying on less than L2,000\r\na year. We are thinking of the young man in the upper and middle classes.\r\nThe man who starts with nothing does not, as a rule, arrive at L2,000 a\r\nyear until he is past the marrying age. So the continuance of the species\r\nwill be carried on almost exclusively by the class of manual workers of a\r\nlow average caliber of brain. The matter is very serious. Reading the\r\nletters and memoirs of a hundred years ago, one is struck by the size of\r\nthe families of the aristocracy. One smiles at reading of the overflowing\r\nnurseries of Edens, and Cokes, and Fitzgeralds. Fourteen or fifteen\r\nchildren were not at all unusual amongst the county families.\"[110]\r\n\r\nEurope's convalescence must, at the very best, be a slow and difficult\r\none. Both materially and spiritually the situation is the reverse of\r\nbright. To begin with, the political situation is highly unsatisfactory.\r\nThe diplomatic arrangements made by the Versailles Peace Conference offer\r\nneither stability nor permanence. In the next chapter I shall have more to\r\nsay about the Versailles Conference. For the moment, let me quote the\r\nobservations of the well-known British publicist J. L. Garvin, who\r\nadequately summarizes the situation when he says: \"As matters stand, no\r\ngreat war ever was followed by a more disquieting and limited peace.\r\nEverywhere the democratic atmosphere is charged with agitation. There is\r\nstill war or anarchy, or both, between the Baltic and the Pacific across a\r\nsixth part of the whole earth. Without a restored Russia no outlook can be\r\nconfident. Either a Bolshevist or reactionary or even a patriotic junction\r\nbetween Germany and Russia might disrupt civilization as violently as\r\nbefore or to even worse effect.\"[111]\r\n\r\nPolitical uncertainty is a poor basis on which to rebuild Europe's\r\nshattered economic life. And this economic reconstruction would, under the\r\nmost favorable circumstances, be very difficult. We have already seen how,\r\nowing to the industrial revolution, Europe became the world's chief\r\nworkshop, exporting manufactured products in return for foodstuffs to feed\r\nits workers and raw materials to feed its machines, these imports being\r\ndrawn from the four quarters of the globe. In other words, Europe had\r\nceased to be self-sufficing, the very life of its industries and its urban\r\npopulations being dependent upon foreign importations from the most\r\ndistant regions. Europe's prosperity before the war was due to the\r\ndevelopment of a marvellous system of world-trade; intricate, nicely\r\nadjusted, functioning with great efficiency, and running at high speed.\r\n\r\nThen down upon this delicately organized mechanism crashed the trip-hammer\r\nof the Great War, literally smashing it to pieces. To reconstruct so\r\nintricate a fabric takes time. Meanwhile, how are the huge urban masses to\r\nlive, unfitted and unable as they are to draw their sustenance from their\r\nnative soil? If their sufferings become too great there is a real danger\r\nthat all Europe may collapse into hopeless chaos. Mr. Frank A. Vanderlip\r\ndid not overstate the danger when he wrote: \"I believe it is possible that\r\nthere may be let loose in Europe forces that will be more terribly\r\ndestructive than have been the forces of the Great War.\"[112]\r\n\r\nThe best description of Europe's economic situation is undoubtedly that of\r\nMr. Herbert Hoover, who, from his experience as inter-Allied food\r\ncontroller, is peculiarly qualified to pass authoritative judgment. Says\r\nMr. Hoover:\r\n\r\n\"The economic difficulties of Europe as a whole at the signature of peace\r\nmay be almost summarized in the phrase 'demoralized productivity.' The\r\nproduction of necessaries for this 450,000,000 population (including\r\nRussia) has never been at so low an ebb as at this day.\r\n\r\n\"A summary of the unemployment bureaus in Europe will show that 15,000,000\r\nfamilies are receiving unemployment allowances in one form or another, and\r\nare, in the main, being paid by constant inflation of currency. A rough\r\nestimate would indicate that the population of Europe is at least\r\n100,000,000 greater than can be supported without imports, and must live\r\nby the production and distribution of exports; and their situation is\r\naggravated not only by lack of raw materials, and imports, but also by low\r\nproduction of European raw materials. Due to the same low production,\r\nEurope is to-day importing vast quantities of certain commodities which\r\nshe formerly produced for herself and can again produce. Generally, in\r\nproduction, she is not only far below even the level of the time of the\r\nsigning of the armistice, but far below the maintenance of life and health\r\nwithout an unparalleled rate of import....\r\n\r\n\"From all these causes, accumulated to different intensity in different\r\nlocalities, there is the essential fact that, unless productivity can be\r\nrapidly increased, there can be nothing but political, moral, and economic\r\nchaos, finally interpreting itself in loss of life on a scale hitherto\r\nundreamed of.\"[113]\r\n\r\nSuch are the material and vital losses inflicted by the Great War. They\r\nare prodigious, and they will not easily be repaired. Europe starts its\r\nreconstruction under heavy handicaps, not the least of these being the\r\ndrain upon its superior stocks, which has deprived it of much of the\r\ncreative energy that it so desperately needs. Those 16,000,000 or more\r\ndead or incapacitated soldiers represented the flower of Europe's young\r\nmanhood--the very men who are especially needed to-day. It is young men\r\nwho normally alone possess both maximum driving power and maximum\r\nplasticity of mind. All the European belligerents are dangerously\r\nimpoverished in their stock of youth. The resultant handicap both to\r\nEurope's working ability and Europe's brain-activity is only too plain.\r\n\r\nMoreover, material and even vital losses do not tell the whole story. The\r\nmoral and spiritual losses, though not easily measured, are perhaps even\r\nmore appalling. In fact, the darkest cloud on the horizon is possibly the\r\ndanger that reconstruction will be primarily material at the expense of\r\nmoral and spiritual values, thus leading to a warped development even more\r\npronounced than that of the nineteenth century and leading inevitably to\r\nyet more disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nThe danger of purely material reconstruction is of course the peril which\r\nlurks behind every great war, and which in the past has wrought such\r\ntragic havoc. At the beginning of the late war we heard much talk of its\r\nmorally \"regenerative\" effects, but as the grim holocaust went on year\r\nafter year, far-sighted moralists warned against a fatal drain of\r\nEurope's idealistic forces which might break the thin crust of European\r\ncivilization so painfully wrought since the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nThat these warning voices were not without reason is proved by the chaos\r\nof spiritual, moral, and even intellectual values which exists in Europe\r\nto-day, giving play to such monstrous insanities as Bolshevism. The danger\r\nis that this chaos may be prolonged and deepened by the complex of two\r\nconcurrent factors: spiritual drain during the war, and spiritual neglect\r\nin the immediate future due to overconcentration upon material\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\nMany of the world's best minds are seriously concerned at the outlook. For\r\nexample, Doctor Gore, the Bishop of Oxford, writes: \"There is the usual\r\ndepression and lowering of moral aims which always follows times of war.\r\nFor the real terror of the time of war is not during the war; then war has\r\ncertain very ennobling powers. It is after-war periods which are the curse\r\nof the world, and it looks as if the same were going to prove true of this\r\nwar. I own that I never felt anxiety such as I do now. I think the aspect\r\nof things has never been so dark as at this moment. I think the temper of\r\nthe nations has degraded since the declaration of the armistice to a\r\ndegree that is almost terrifying.\"[114]\r\n\r\nThe intellectual impoverishment wrought by the war is well summarized by\r\nProfessor C. G. Shaw. \"We did more before the war than we shall do after\r\nit,\" he writes. \"War will have so exhausted man's powers of action and\r\nthought that he will have little wit or will left for the promotion of\r\nanything over and above necessary repair.\"[115]\r\n\r\nEurope's general impoverishment in all respects was vividly portrayed by a\r\nleading article of the London _Saturday Review_ entitled \"The True\r\nDestructiveness of War.\" Pointing to the devastated areas of northern\r\nFrance as merely symptomatic of the devastation wrought in spiritual as\r\nwell as material fields, it said:\r\n\r\n\"Reflection only adds to the effect upon us of these miles of wasted\r\ncountry and ruined towns. All this represents not a thousandth part of the\r\ndesolation which the war has brought upon our civilization. These\r\ndevastated areas scarring the face of Europe are but a symbol of the\r\ndesolation which will shadow the life of the world for at least a\r\ngeneration. The coming years will be bleak, in respect of all the generous\r\nand gracious things which are the products of leisure and of minds not\r\nwholly taken up by the necessity to live by bread alone. For a generation\r\nthe world will have to concentrate upon material problems.\r\n\r\n\"The tragedy of the Great War--a tragedy which enhances the desolation of\r\nRheims--is that it should have killed almost everything which the best of\r\nour soldiers died to preserve, and that it should have raised more\r\nproblems than it has solved.\r\n\r\n\"We would sacrifice a dozen cathedrals to preserve what the war has\r\ndestroyed in England.... We would readily surrender our ten best\r\ncathedrals to be battered by the artillery of Hindenburg as a ransom.\r\nSurely it would be better to lose Westminster Abbey than never again to\r\nhave anybody worthy to be buried there.\"[116]\r\n\r\nEurope is, indeed, passing through the most critical spiritual phase of\r\nthe war's aftermath--what I may term the zero hour of the spirit. When the\r\ntrenches used to fill with infantry waiting in the first cold flicker of\r\nthe dawn for the signal to go \"over the top,\" they called it the \"zero\r\nhour.\" Well, Europe now faces the zero hour of peace. It is neither a\r\npleasant nor a stimulating moment. The \"tumult and the shouting\" have\r\ndied. The captains, kings--and presidents--have departed. War's hectic\r\nurge wanes, losses are counted, the heroic pose is dropped. Such is the\r\nmoment when the peoples are bidden to go \"over the top\" once more, this\r\ntime toward peace objectives no less difficult than those of the\r\nbattle-field. Weakened, tired Europe knows this, feels this--and dreads\r\nthe plunge into the unknown. Hence the _malaise_ of the zero hour.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary turmoil of the European soul is strikingly set forth by\r\nthe French thinker Paul Valery.\r\n\r\n\"We civilizations,\" he writes, \"now know that we are mortal. We had heard\r\ntell of whole worlds vanished, of empires gone to the bottom with all\r\ntheir engines; sunk to the inexplorable bottom of the centuries with their\r\ngods and their laws, their academies, their science, pure and applied;\r\ntheir grammars, their dictionaries, their classics, their romantics and\r\ntheir symbolists, their critics and their critics' critics. We knew well\r\nthat all the apparent earth is made of ashes, and that ashes have a\r\nmeaning. We perceived, through the mists of history, phantoms and huge\r\nships laden with riches and spiritual things. We could not count them. But\r\nthese wrecks, after all, were no concern of ours.\r\n\r\n\"Elam, Nineveh, Babylon were vague and lovely names, and the total ruin of\r\nthese worlds meant as little to us as their very existence. But France,\r\nEngland, Russia--these would also be lovely names. Lusitania also is a\r\nlovely name. And now we see that the abyss of history is large enough for\r\nevery one. We feel that a civilization is as fragile as a life.\r\nCircumstances which would send the works of Baudelaire and Keats to rejoin\r\nthe works of Menander are no longer in the least inconceivable; they are\r\nin all the newspapers....\r\n\r\n\"Thus the spiritual Persepolis is ravaged equally with the material Susa.\r\nAll is not lost, but everything has felt itself perish.\r\n\r\n\"An extraordinary tremor has run through the spinal marrow of Europe. It\r\nhas felt, in all its thinking substance, that it recognized itself no\r\nlonger, that it no longer resembled itself, that it was about to lose\r\nconsciousness--a consciousness acquired by centuries of tolerable\r\ndisasters, by thousands of men of the first rank, by geographical, racial,\r\nhistorical chances innumerable....\r\n\r\n\"The military crisis is perhaps at an end; the economic crisis is visibly\r\nat its zenith; but the intellectual crisis--it is with difficulty that we\r\ncan seize its true centre, its exact phase. The facts, however, are clear\r\nand pitiless: there are thousands of young writers and young artists who\r\nare dead. There is the lost illusion of a European culture, and the\r\ndemonstration of the impotence of knowledge to save anything whatever;\r\nthere is science, mortally wounded in its moral ambitions, and, as it\r\nwere, dishonored by its applications; there is idealism, victor with\r\ndifficulty, grievously mutilated, responsible for its dreams; realism,\r\ndeceived, beaten, with crimes and misdeeds heaped upon it; covetousness\r\nand renunciation equally put out; religions confused among the armies,\r\ncross against cross, crescent against crescent; there are the sceptics\r\nthemselves, disconcerted by events so sudden, so violent, and so moving,\r\nwhich play with our thoughts as a cat with a mouse--the sceptics lose\r\ntheir doubts, rediscover them, lose them again, and can no longer make use\r\nof the movements of their minds.\r\n\r\n\"The rolling of the ship has been so heavy that at the last the best-hung\r\nlamps have been upset.\r\n\r\n\"From an immense terrace of Elsinore which extends from Basle to Cologne,\r\nand touches the sands of Nieuport, the marshes of the Somme, the chalk of\r\nChampagne, and the granite of Alsace, the Hamlet of Europe now looks upon\r\nmillions of ghosts.\"[117]\r\n\r\nSuch is Europe's deplorable condition as she staggers forth from the\r\nhideous ordeal of the Great War; her fluid capital dissipated, her fixed\r\ncapital impaired, her industrial fabric rent and tattered, her finances\r\nthreatened with bankruptcy, the flower of her manhood dead on the\r\nbattle-field, her populations devitalized and discouraged, her children\r\nstunted by malnutrition. A sombre picture.\r\n\r\nAnd Europe is the white homeland, the heart of the white world. It is\r\nEurope that has suffered practically all the losses of Armageddon, which\r\nmay be considered the white civil war. The colored world remains virtually\r\nunscathed.\r\n\r\nHere is the truth of the matter: The white world to-day stands at the\r\ncrossroads of life and death. It stands where the Greek world stood at the\r\nclose of the Peloponnesian War. A fever has racked the white frame and\r\nundermined its constitution. The unsound therapeutics of its diplomatic\r\npractitioners retard convalescence and endanger real recovery. Worst of\r\nall, the instinct of race-solidarity has partially atrophied.\r\n\r\nGrave as is the situation, it is not yet irreparable, any more than\r\nGreece's condition was hopeless after AEgospotami. It was not the\r\nPeloponnesian War which sealed Hellas's doom, but the cycle of political\r\nanarchy and moral chaos of which the Peloponnesian War was merely the\r\nopening phase. Our world is too vigorous for even the Great War, of\r\nitself, to prove a mortal wound.\r\n\r\nThe white world thus still has its choice. But it must be a positive\r\nchoice. Decisions--firm decisions--must be made. Constructive\r\nmeasures--drastic measures--must be taken. Above all: time presses, and\r\ndrift is fatal. The tide ebbs. The swimmer must put forth strong strokes\r\nto reach the shore. Else--swift oblivion in the dark ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SHATTERING OF WHITE SOLIDARITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instinctive comity of the white peoples is, as I have already said,\r\nperhaps the greatest constant of history. It is the psychological basis of\r\nwhite civilization. Cohesive instinct is as vital to race as gravitation\r\nis to matter. Without them, atomic disintegration would alike result. In\r\nspeaking of race-instinct, I am not referring merely to the ethnic\r\ntheories that have been elaborated at various times. Those theories were,\r\nafter all, but attempts to explain intellectually the urge of that\r\nprofound emotion known to sociologists as the \"consciousness of kind.\"\r\n\r\nWhite race-consciousness has been of course perturbed by numberless\r\ninternal frictions, which have at times produced partial inhibitions of\r\nunitary feeling. Nevertheless, when really faced by non-white opposition,\r\nwhite men have in the past instinctively tended to close their ranks\r\nagainst the common foe. One of the Great War's most deplorable results has\r\nbeen an unprecedented weakening of white solidarity which, if not\r\nrepaired, may produce the most disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century the sentiment of white solidarity was\r\nstrong. The great explorers and empire-builders who spread white\r\nascendancy to the ends of the earth felt that they were apostles of their\r\nrace and civilization as well as of a particular country. Rivalries might\r\nbe keen and colonial boundary questions acute; nevertheless, in their\r\ncalmer moments, the white peoples felt that the expansion of one white\r\nnation buttressed the expansion of all.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pearson undoubtedly voiced the spirit of the day when he wrote\r\n(about 1890) that it would be well \"if European statesmen could understand\r\nthat the wars which carry desolation into civilized countries are allowing\r\nthe lower races to recruit their numbers and strength. Two centuries hence\r\nit may be matter of serious concern to the world if Russia has been\r\ndisplaced by China on the Amoor, if France has not been able to colonize\r\nNorth Africa, or if England is not holding India. For civilized men there\r\ncan be only one fatherland, and whatever extends the influence of those\r\nraces that have taken their faith from Palestine, their laws of beauty\r\nfrom Greece, and their civil law from Rome, ought to be matter of\r\nrejoicing to Russian, German, Anglo-Saxon, and Frenchman alike.\"[118]\r\n\r\nThe progress of science also fortified white race-consciousness with its\r\nsanctions. The researches of European scholars identified the founders of\r\nour civilization with a race of tall, white-skinned barbarians, possessing\r\nregular features, brown or blond hair, and light eyes. This was, of\r\ncourse, what we now know as the Nordic type. At first the problem was ill\r\nunderstood, the tests applied being language and culture rather than\r\nphysical characteristics. For these reasons the early \"Caucasian\" and\r\n\"Aryan\" hypotheses were self-contradictory and inadequate. Nevertheless,\r\nthe basis was sound, and the effects on white popular psychology were\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nParticularly good were the effects upon the peoples predominantly of\r\nNordic blood. Obviously typifying as they did the prehistoric creators of\r\nwhite civilization, Nordics everywhere were strengthened in consciousness\r\nof genetic worth, feeling of responsibility for world-progress, and urge\r\ntoward fraternal collaboration. The supreme value of Nordic blood was\r\nclearly analyzed by the French thinker Count Arthur de Gobineau as early\r\nas 1854[119] (albeit Gobineau employed the misleading \"Aryan\"\r\nterminology), and his thesis was subsequently elaborated by many other\r\nwriters, notably by Englishmen, Germans, and Scandinavians.\r\n\r\nThe results of all this were plainly apparent by the closing years of the\r\nnineteenth century. Quickened Nordic race-consciousness played an\r\nimportant part in stimulating Anglo-American fraternization, and induced\r\nacts like the Oxford Scholarship legacy of Cecil Rhodes. The trend of this\r\nmovement, though cross-cut by nationalistic considerations, was clearly in\r\nthe direction of a Nordic _entente_--a Pan-Nordic syndication of power for\r\nthe safeguarding of the race-heritage and the harmonious evolution of the\r\nwhole white world. It was a glorious aspiration, which, had it been\r\nrealized, would have averted Armageddon.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the aspiration remained a dream. The ill-balanced tendencies\r\nof the late nineteenth century were against it, and they ultimately\r\nprevailed. The abnormal growth of national-imperialism, in particular,\r\nwrought fatal havoc. The exponents of imperialistic propagandas like\r\nPan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism put forth literally boundless pretensions,\r\nplanning the domination of the entire planet by their special brand of\r\nnational-imperialism. Such men had scant regard for race-lines. All who\r\nstood outside their particular nationalistic group were vowed to the same\r\nsubjection.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the national-imperialists presently seized upon race teachings,\r\nand prostituted them to their own ends. A notable example of this is the\r\nextreme Pan-German propaganda of Houston Stewart Chamberlain[120] and his\r\nfellows. Chamberlain makes two cardinal assumptions: he conceives modern\r\nGermany as racially almost purely Nordic; and he regards all Nordics\r\noutside the German linguistic-cultural group as either unconscious or\r\nrenegade Teutons who must at all costs be brought into the German fold. To\r\nany one who understands the scientific realities of race, the monstrous\r\nabsurdity of these assumptions is instantly apparent. The fact is that\r\nmodern Germany, far from being purely Nordic, is mainly Alpine in race.\r\nNordic blood preponderates only in the northwest, and is merely veneered\r\nover the rest of Germany, especially in the upper classes. While the\r\n_Germania_ of Roman days was unquestionably a Nordic land, it has been\r\ncomputed that of the 70,000,000 inhabitants of the German Empire in 1914,\r\nonly 9,000,000 were purely Nordic in character. This displacement of the\r\nGerman Nordics since classic times is chiefly due to Germany's troubled\r\nhistory, especially to the horrible Thirty Years' War which virtually\r\nannihilated the Nordics of south Germany. This racial displacement has\r\nwrought correspondingly profound changes in the character of the German\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter is, of course, that the Pan-Germans were thinking\r\nin terms of nationality instead of race, and that they were using\r\npseudo-racial arguments as camouflage for essentially political ends. The\r\npity of it is that these arguments have had such disastrous repercussions\r\nin the genuine racial sphere. The late war has not only exploded\r\nPan-Germanism, it has also discredited Nordic race-feeling, so unjustly\r\nconfused by many persons with Pan-German nationalistic propaganda. Such\r\npersons should remember that the overwhelming majority of Nordics live\r\noutside of Germany, being mainly found in Scandinavia, the Anglo-Saxon\r\ncountries, northern France, the Netherlands, and Baltic Russia. To let\r\nTeuton propaganda gull us into thinking of Germany as the Nordic\r\nfatherland is both a danger and an absurdity.\r\n\r\nWhile Pan-Germanism was mainly responsible for precipitating Armageddon\r\nwith all its disastrous consequences, it was Russian Pan-Slavism which\r\ndealt the first shrewd blow to white solidarity. Toward the close of the\r\nnineteenth century, Pan-Slavism's \"Eastern\" wing, led by Prince Ukhtomsky\r\nand other chauvinists of his ilk, went so far in its imperialistic\r\nobsession as actually to deny Russia's white blood. These Pan-Slavists\r\nboldly proclaimed the morbid, mystical dogma that Russia was Asiatic, not\r\nEuropean, and thereupon attempted to seize China as a lever for upsetting,\r\nfirst the rest of Asia, and then the non-Russian white world--elegantly\r\ndescribed as \"the rotten west.\" The white Power immediately menaced was,\r\nof course, England, who in acute fear for her Indian Empire, promptly\r\nriposted by allying herself with Japan. Russia was diplomatically isolated\r\nand militarily beaten in the Russo-Japanese War. Thus the Russo-Japanese\r\nWar, that destroyer of white prestige whose ominous results we have\r\nalready noted, was precipitated mainly by the reckless short-sightedness\r\nof white men themselves.\r\n\r\nA second blow to white solidarity was presently administered--this time by\r\nEngland in concluding her second alliance-treaty with Japan. The original\r\nalliance, signed in 1902, was negotiated for a definite, limited\r\nobjective--the checkmating of Russia's over-weening imperialism. Even that\r\ninstrument was dangerous, but under the circumstances it was justifiable\r\nand inevitable. The second alliance-treaty, however, was so general and\r\nfar-reaching in character that practically all white men in the Far East,\r\nincluding most emphatically Englishmen themselves, pronounced it a great\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, German imperialism was plotting even deadlier strokes at white\r\nrace-comity, not merely by preparing war against white neighbors in\r\nEurope, but also by ingratiating itself with the Moslem East and by toying\r\nwith schemes for building up a black military empire in central Africa.\r\n\r\nLastly, France was actually recruiting black, brown, and yellow hordes for\r\nuse on European battle-fields; while Italy, by her buccaneering raid on\r\nTripoli, outraged Islam's sense of justice and strained its patience to\r\nthe breaking-point.\r\n\r\nThus, in the years preceding Armageddon, all the European Powers displayed\r\na reckless absorption in particularistic ambitions and showed a callous\r\nindifference to larger race-interests. The rapid weakening of white\r\nsolidarity was clearly apparent.\r\n\r\nHowever, white solidarity, though diplomatically compromised, was\r\nemotionally not yet really undermined. Those dangerous games above\r\nmentioned were largely the work of cynical chancelleries and\r\nultra-imperialist propagandas. The average European, whatever his\r\nnationality, still tended to react instinctively against such practices.\r\nThis was shown by the sharp criticism which arose from the most varied\r\nquarters. For example: Russia and Britain were alike sternly taken to task\r\nboth at home and abroad for their respective Far Eastern policies;\r\nproposed German alliances with Pan-Islamism and Japan preached by\r\ndisciples of _Machtpolitik_ were strenuously opposed as race-treason by\r\npowerful sections of German thought; while Italy's Tripolitan imbroglio\r\nwas generally denounced as the most foolhardy trifling with the common\r\nEuropean interest.\r\n\r\nA good illustration of instinctive white solidarity in the early years of\r\nthe twentieth century is a French journalist's description of the attitude\r\nof the white spectators (of various nationalities) gathered to watch the\r\nlanding in Japan of the first Russian prisoners taken in the\r\nRusso-Japanese War. This writer depicts in moving language the literally\r\nhorrifying effect of the spectacle upon himself and his fellows. \"What a\r\ntriumph,\" he exclaims, \"what a revenge for the little Nippons to see thus\r\nhumiliated these big, splendid men who, for them, represented, not only\r\nRussians, but those Europeans whom they so detest! This scene tragic in\r\nits simplicity, this grief passing amid joy, these whites, vanquished and\r\ncaptives, defiling before those free and triumphant yellows--this was not\r\nRussia beaten by Japan, not the defeat of one nation by another; it was\r\nsomething new, enormous, prodigious; it was the victory of one world over\r\nanother; it was the revenge which effaced the centuries of humiliations\r\nborne by Asia; it was the awakening hope of the Oriental peoples; it was\r\nthe first blow given to the other race, to that accursed race of the West,\r\nwhich, for so many years, had triumphed without even having to struggle.\r\nAnd the Japanese crowd felt all this, and the few other Asiatics who found\r\nthemselves there shared in this triumph. The humiliation of these whites\r\nwas solemn, frightful. I completely forgot that these captives were\r\nRussians, and I would add that the other Europeans there, though\r\nanti-Russian, felt the same _malaise_: they also were forced to feel that\r\nthese captives were their own kind. When we took the train for Kobe, an\r\ninstinctive solidarity drove us huddling into the same compartment.\"[121]\r\n\r\nThus white solidarity, while unquestionably weakened, was still a weighty\r\nfactor down to August, 1914. But the first shots of Armageddon saw white\r\nsolidarity literally blown from the muzzles of the guns. An explosion of\r\ninternecine hatred burst forth more intense and general than any ever\r\nknown before. Both sets of combatants proclaimed a duel to the death; both\r\nsides vowed the enemy to something near annihilation; while even\r\nscientists and _litterateurs_, disrupting the ancient commonwealths of\r\nwisdom and beauty, put one another furiously to the ban.\r\n\r\nIn their savage death-grapple neither side hesitated for an instant to\r\ngrasp at any weapon, whatever the ultimate consequences to the race. The\r\nAllies poured into white Europe colored hordes of every pigment under the\r\nsun; the Teutonic Powers wielded Pan-Islam as a besom of wrath to sweep\r\nclean every white foothold in Hither Asia and North Africa; while far and\r\nwide over the Dark Continent black armies fought for their respective\r\nmasters--and learned the hidden weakness of the white man's power. In the\r\nFar East, Japan, left to her own devices, bent amorphous China to her\r\nimperious will, thereby raising up a potential menace for the entire\r\nearth. Every day the tide of intestine hatred within the white world rose\r\nhigher, until the very concept of a common blood and cultural past seemed\r\nin danger of being blotted out.\r\n\r\nA symposium of the \"hate literature\" of the Great War is fortunately no\r\npart of my task, but the reader will readily recall both its abysmal fury\r\nand its irreconcilable implications. The most appalling feature was the\r\nway in which many writers assumed that this state of mind would be\r\npermanent; that the end of the Great War might be only the beginning of a\r\nwar-cycle leading to the utter disruption of white solidarity and\r\ncivilization. In the spring of 1916, the London _Nation_ remarked\r\ngloomily: \"Europe is now being mentally conceived as inevitably and\r\npermanently dual. We are ceasing to think of Europe. The normal end of war\r\n(which is peace) is to be submerged in the idea of a war-series\r\nindefinitely prolonged. Soon the entire Continent will have but one\r\nlonging--the longing for rest. The cup is to be dashed from its lips! For\r\na world steeped in fear and ruled by the barren logomachy of hate,\r\ndiplomatic intercourse would almost cease to be possible.... In the matter\r\nof culture, modern Europe would tend to relapse to a state inferior even\r\nto that of mediaeval Europe, and to sink far below that of the\r\nRenaissance.\"[122]\r\n\r\nIn similar vein, the noted German historian Eduard Meyer[123] predicted\r\nthat Armageddon was only the first of a long series of Anglo-German \"Punic\r\nWars\" in which modern civilization would retrograde to a condition of\r\nsemi-barbarism. Germany, according to this prophecy, would be the\r\nvictor--but a Pyrrhic victor, for the colored races, taking advantage of\r\nwhite decadence, would destroy European supremacy and involve all the\r\nwhite nations in a common ruin.\r\n\r\nThe ulcerated state of European war-psychology did, in fact, lend ominous\r\nemphasis to these gloomy prognostications. Before 1914, as we have seen,\r\nimperialistic trafficking with common race-interests usually roused\r\nwide-spread criticism, while even more, the use of colored troops in white\r\nquarrels always roused bitter popular condemnation. In the darkest hours\r\nof the Boer War, English public opinion had refused to sanction the use of\r\neither black African or brown Indian troops against the white foe, while\r\nFrench plans for raising black armies of African savages for use in Europe\r\nwere almost universally reprobated. Before Armageddon there thus existed a\r\ngenuine moral repugnance against settling domestic differences by calling\r\nin the alien without the gates.\r\n\r\nThe Great War, however, sent all such scruples promptly into the discard.\r\nNot only did the belligerent governments use all the colored troops they\r\ncould equip, but the belligerent peoples hailed this action with\r\nunqualified approval. The Allies were of course the more successful in\r\npractice, but the Germans were just as eager, and the exertions of the\r\nPrussian General Liman von Sanders actually got Turkish divisions to the\r\nEuropean battle-fronts.\r\n\r\nThe psychological effect of these colored auxiliaries in deepening the\r\nhatred of the white combatants was deplorable. Germany's use of Turks\r\nraised among the Allies wrathful emotions reminiscent of the Crusades,\r\nwhile the havoc wrought in the Teutonic ranks by black Senegalese and\r\nyellow Gurkhas, together with Allied utterances like Lord Curzon's wish to\r\nsee Bengal lancers on the Unter den Linden and Gurkhas camping at Sans\r\nSouci, so maddened the German people that the very suggestion of white\r\nsolidarity was jeeringly scoffed at as the most idiotic sentimentality.\r\n\r\nHere is a German officer's account of a Senegalese attack on his position,\r\nwhich vividly depicts the mingled horror and fury awakened in German\r\nhearts by these black opponents: \"They came. First singly, at wide\r\nintervals. Feeling their way, like the arms of a horrible cuttlefish.\r\nEager, grasping, like the claws of a mighty monster. Thus they rushed\r\ncloser, flickering and sometimes disappearing in the cloud. Entire bodies\r\nand single limbs, now showing in the harsh glare, now sinking in the\r\nshadows, came nearer and nearer. Strong, wild fellows, their log-like,\r\nfat, black skulls wrapped in pieces of dirty rags. Showing their grinning\r\nteeth like panthers, with their bellies drawn in and their necks stretched\r\nforward. Some with bayonets on their rifles. Many only armed with knives.\r\nMonsters all, in their confused hatred. Frightful their distorted, dark\r\ngrimaces. Horrible their unnaturally wide-opened, burning, bloodshot eyes.\r\nEyes that seem like terrible beings themselves. Like unearthly, hell-born\r\nbeings. Eyes that seemed to run ahead of their owners, lashed, unchained,\r\nno longer to be restrained. On they came like dogs gone mad and cats\r\nspitting and yowling, with a burning lust for human blood, with a cruel\r\ndissemblance of their beastly malice. Behind them came the first wave of\r\nthe attackers, in close order, a solid, rolling black wall, rising and\r\nfalling, swaying and heaving, impenetrable, endless.\"[124]\r\n\r\nHere, again, is the proposal of a British officer, to raise a million\r\nblack savages from England's African colonies for use on the Western\r\nFront. Major Stuart-Stephens exults in Britain's \"almost unlimited\r\nreservoir of African man-power.\" In northern Nigeria alone, he remarks,\r\nthere are to-day more than 700,000 warlike tribesmen. \"Let them be used!\"\r\nsays the major. \"These 'bonny fechters' are now engaged in the pastoral\r\narts of peace. But I would make bold to assert that a couple of hundred\r\nthousand could, after six months' training, be usefully employed in\r\ndaredevil charges into German trenches.\" Major Stuart-Stephens hopes that\r\nat least the Sudanese battalions will be transferred _en masse_ to the\r\nWestern Front. \"This,\" he concludes, \"would mean the placing at once in\r\nthe trenches of, say, 70,000 big, lusty coal-black devils, the time of\r\nwhose life is the wielding of the bayonet, and whose advent would not be\r\nregarded by the Boches as a pleasing omen of more to come of the same\r\nsort.\"[125]\r\n\r\nThe military possibilities are truly engaging! There are literally tens of\r\nmillions of fighting blacks and scores of millions of fighting Asiatics\r\nnow living under white rule who could conceivably be armed and shipped to\r\nEuropean battle-fields. After which, of course, Europe, the white\r\nhomeland, would be--a queer place.\r\n\r\nFortunately for our race, the late war did not see this sort of thing\r\ncarried to its logical conclusion. But the harm done was bad enough. The\r\nwhite world grew accustomed to the use of colored mercenaries and to the\r\ncontracting of alliances with colored peoples against white opponents as a\r\nmere matter of course.\r\n\r\nThe German war-mind, in particular, teemed with colored alliance-projects.\r\nUnable to compete with the Allies in getting colored troops to Europe,\r\nGermans planned to revenge themselves in other fields. The Turkish\r\nalliance and the resulting \"Holy War\" proclamation were hailed with\r\ndelight. \"Over there in Turkey,\" wrote the well-known German publicist\r\nErnst Jaeckh, \"stretch Anatolia and Mesopotamia: Anatolia, the 'Land of\r\nthe Sunrise'; Mesopotamia, the region of ancient paradise. May these names\r\nbe to us a sign: may this World War bring to Germany and Turkey the\r\nsunrise and the paradise of a new time; may it confer upon an assured\r\nTurkey and a Greater Germany the blessing of a fruitful Turco-Teutonic\r\ncollaboration in peace after a victorious Turco-Teutonic collaboration in\r\nwar.\"[126]\r\n\r\nThe scope of Germany's Asiatic aspirations during the war is exemplified\r\nby an article from the pen of the learned Orientalist Professor Bernhardt\r\nMolden.[127] Germany's aid to Turkey, contends Professor Molden, is merely\r\nsymptomatic of her policy to raise the other Asiatic peoples now crushed\r\nbeneath English and Russian domination. Thus Germany will create puissant\r\nallies for the \"Second Punic War.\" Germany must therefore strive to\r\nsolidify the great Central Asian _bloc_--Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan,\r\nChina. Professor Molden urges a \"Pan-Asian railroad\" from Constantinople\r\nto Peking. This should be especially alluring to Afghanistan, which would\r\nthereby become one of the great pivots of world-politics and trade. In\r\nfine: \"Germany must free Asia.\" As another prominent German writer,\r\nFriedrich Delitzsch, wrote in similar vein: \"To renovate the East--such is\r\nGermany's mission.\"[128]\r\n\r\nIn such a mood, Germans hailed Japan's absence of genuine hostility with\r\nthe greatest satisfaction. The gust of rage which swept Germany at\r\nJapan's seizure of Kiao-chao was soon allayed by numerous writers\r\npreaching reconciliation and eventual alliance with the mistress of the\r\nFar East. Typical of this pro-Japanese propaganda is an article by Herr J.\r\nWitte, a former official in the Far East, which appeared in 1915. Herr\r\nWitte chides his countrymen for their talk about the Yellow Peril. Such a\r\nperil may exist in the future, but it is not pressing at this moment, \"at\r\nany rate for us Germans, who have no great territorial possessions in the\r\nFar East.... We might permit ourselves to speak of a Yellow Peril if there\r\nwas a white solidarity. This, however, does not exist. We are learning\r\nthis just now by bitter experience on our own flesh and blood. Our foes\r\nhave marshalled peoples of all races against us in battle. So long as this\r\nhelps them, all race-antipathies and race-interests are to them matters of\r\nsupreme indifference. Under these circumstances, in the midst of a\r\nlife-and-death struggle against the peoples of the white race, shall we\r\nplay the role of guardian angel of these peoples against the yellow\r\npeoples? For us, as Germans, there is now only one supreme life-interest,\r\nto which all other interests must be subordinated: the safety and\r\nadvancement of Germany and of _Deutschtum_ in the world.\" Herr Witte\r\ntherefore advocates a \"close political understanding between Germany and\r\nJapan. In future we can accomplish nothing in the teeth of Japan.\r\nTherefore we must get on good terms with Japan. And we can do it, too.\r\nGermany is, in fact, the country above all others who in the future has\r\nthe best prospect of allying herself advantageously with the Far Eastern\r\npeoples.\"[129]\r\n\r\nAnd so it went throughout the war-years: both sides using all possible\r\ncolored aid to down the white foe; both sides alike reckless of the\r\nultimate racial consequences.\r\n\r\nIn fact, leaving ultimate consequences aside, many persons feared during\r\nthe later phases of the war that Europe might be headed for immediate\r\ndissolution. As early as mid-1916, Lord Loreburn expressed apprehension\r\nlest the war was entailing general bankruptcy and \"such a destruction of\r\nthe male youth of Europe as will break the thin crust of civilization\r\nwhich has been built up since the Dark Ages.\"[130] These fears were\r\nintensified by the Russian revolution of 1917, with its hideous corollary\r\nof Bolshevism which definitely triumphed before the close of that year.\r\nThe Bolshevik triumph evoked despairing predictions like Lord Lansdowne's:\r\n\"We are not going to lose this war, but its prolongation will spell ruin\r\nfor the civilized world.\"[131]\r\n\r\nWell, the war was prolonged for another year, ending in the triumph of the\r\nAllies and America, though leaving Europe in the deplorable condition\r\nreviewed in the preceding chapter. The hopes of mankind were now centred\r\non the Peace Conference, but these hopes were oversanguine, for the\r\nVersailles \"settlement\" was riddled with political and economic\r\nimperfections from the Saar to Shantung.\r\n\r\nThis was what a sceptical minority had feared from the first. At the very\r\nbeginning of the war, for instance, the French publicist Urbain Gohier had\r\npredicted that when the diplomats gathered at the end of the conflict they\r\nwould find the problem of constructive settlement insoluble.[132]\r\n\r\nMost persons, however, had been more hopeful. Disappointment and\r\ndisillusionment were therefore correspondingly intense. The majority of\r\nliberal-minded, forward-looking men and women throughout the world\r\ndeplored the Versailles settlement's faulty character, some, however,\r\naccepting the situation as the best of a bad business, others entirely\r\nrepudiating it on the ground that by crystallizing an intolerable status\r\nit would entail worse disasters in the near future.\r\n\r\nGeneral Smuts, the South African delegate to the Conference, well\r\nrepresents the first attitude. In a formal protest against the Versailles\r\nsettlement, General Smuts stated: \"I have signed the peace treaty, not\r\nbecause I consider it a satisfactory document, but because it is\r\nimperatively necessary to close the war; because the world needs peace\r\nabove all, and nothing could be more fatal than the continuance of the\r\nstate of suspense between war and peace. The six months since the\r\narmistice was signed have, perhaps, been as upsetting, unsettling, and\r\nruinous to Europe as the previous four years of war. I look upon the peace\r\ntreaty as the close of these two chapters of war and armistice, and only\r\non that ground do I agree to it. I say this now, not in criticism, but in\r\nfaith; not because I wish to find fault with the work done, but rather\r\nbecause I feel that in the treaty we have not yet achieved the real peace\r\nto which our peoples were looking, and because I feel that the real work\r\nof making peace will only begin after this treaty has been signed, and a\r\ndefinite halt has thereby been called to the destructive passions that\r\nhave been desolating Europe for nearly five years.\"[133]\r\n\r\nThe English economist J. L. Garvin, who, like General Smuts, accepted the\r\ntreaty _faute de mieux_, makes these trenchant comments upon the\r\nsettlement itself: \"Derisive human genius surveying with pity and laughter\r\nthe present state of mankind and some of the obsolete means adopted at\r\nParis to remedy it, might do most good by another satire like Rabelais,\r\nGulliver, or Candide. But let us put from us here the temptation to\r\nconjure up vistas of the grotesque. Let us pursue these plain studies in\r\ncommon sense. A treaty even when signed is paper. It is in itself\r\ninoperative without the action or control of living forces which it seeks\r\nto express or repress. Treaties not drawn against sound and certain assets\r\nmay be dishonored in the sequel like bad checks or bills. You do not get\r\npeace merely by putting it on paper. And, much more to the point, all\r\nthat is called peace does not necessarily spell prosperity any more than\r\nall that glitters is gold. You can 'make a solitude and call it peace.'\r\nThe quintessence of death or stupefaction resembles a kind of peace. You\r\ncan prolong relative stagnation and depression and yet say that it is\r\npeace. But that would not be the reconciling and lasting, the constructive\r\nand the creative peace, as it was visioned by the Allied peoples in their\r\ngreatest moments of insight and inspiration during the war. For that\r\nhigher and wiser thing we lavished our pent-up energies and the\r\naccumulated treasure of a hundred years, and sent so many of our best to\r\ndie.\"[134]\r\n\r\nThat veteran student of world-politics Doctor E. J. Dillon put the matter\r\nsuccinctly when he wrote: \"The peace is being made not, as originally\r\nprojected, on the basis of the fourteen points, nor on the lines of\r\nterritorial equilibrium, but by a compromise which misses the advantage of\r\neither, and combines certain evils of both. The treaty has failed to lay\r\nthe axe to the roots of war, has perhaps increased their number while\r\npurporting to destroy them. The germs of future conflicts, not only\r\nbetween the recent belligerents, but also between other groups of states,\r\nare numerous, and if present symptoms may be trusted will sprout up in the\r\nfulness of time.\"[135]\r\n\r\nThe badness of the Versailles treaties is nowhere more manifest than in\r\nthe way they have alienated idealistic support and enthusiasm from the\r\ninchoate League of Nations. Multitudes of persons once zealous Leaguers\r\nnow feel that the League has no moral foundation. Such persons contend\r\nthat even were the covenant theoretically perfect, the League could no\r\nmore succeed on the basis of the present peace settlement than a\r\nflawlessly designed palace could be erected if superimposed upon a\r\nquicksand.\r\n\r\nEurope is thus in evil case. Her statesmen have failed to formulate a\r\nconstructive settlement. Old problems remain unsolved while fresh problems\r\narise. The danger is redoubled by the fact that both Europe and the entire\r\nworld are faced with a new peril--Bolshevism. The menace of Bolshevism is\r\nsimply incalculable. Bolshevism is a peril in some ways unprecedented in\r\nthe world's history. It is not merely a war against a social system, not\r\nmerely a war against our civilization; it is a war of the hand against the\r\nbrain. For the first time since man was man there is a definite schism\r\nbetween the hand and the head. Every principle which mankind has thus far\r\nevolved: community of interest, the solidarity of civilization and\r\nculture, the dignity of labor, of muscle, of brawn, dominated and\r\nillumined by intellect and spirit--all these Bolshevism howls down and\r\ntramples in the mud.\r\n\r\nBolshevism's cardinal tenets--the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the\r\ndestruction of the \"classes\" by social war--are of truly hideous import.\r\nThe \"classes,\" as conceived by Bolshevism, are very numerous. They\r\ncomprise not merely the \"idle rich,\" but also the whole of the upper and\r\nmiddle social strata, the landowning country folk, the skilled working\r\nmen; in short, all except those who work with their untutored hands,\r\n_plus_ the elect few who philosophize for those who work with their\r\nuntutored hands.\r\n\r\nThe effect of such ideas, if successful, not only on our civilization, but\r\nalso on the very fibre of the race, can be imagined. The death or\r\ndegradation of nearly all persons displaying constructive ability, and the\r\ntyranny of the ignorant and anti-social elements, would be the most\r\ngigantic triumph of disgenics ever seen. Beside it the ill effects of war\r\nwould pale into insignificance. Civilization would wither like a plant\r\nstricken by blight, while the race, summarily drained of its good blood,\r\nwould sink like lead into the depths of degenerate barbarism.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what is occurring in Russia to-day. Bolshevism has ruled\r\nRussia less than three years--and Russia is ruined. She ekes out a bare\r\nexistence on the remains of past accumulations, on the surviving scraps of\r\nher material and spiritual capital. Everywhere are hunger, cold, disease,\r\nterror, physical and moral death. The \"proletariat\" is making its \"clean\r\nsweep.\" The \"classes\" are being systematically eliminated by execution,\r\nmassacre, and starvation. The racial impoverishment is simply\r\nincalculable. Meanwhile Lenine, surrounded by his Chinese executioners,\r\nsits behind the Kremlin walls, a modern Jenghiz Khan plotting the plunder\r\nof a world.\r\n\r\nLenine's Chinese \"braves\" are merely symptomatic of the intrigues which\r\nBolshevism is carrying on throughout the non-white world. Bolshevism is,\r\nin fact, as anti-racial as it is anti-social. To the Bolshevik mind, with\r\nits furious hatred of constructive ability and its fanatical determination\r\nto enforce levelling, proletarian equality, the very existence of superior\r\nbiological values is a crime. Bolshevism has vowed the proletarianization\r\nof the world, beginning with the white peoples. To this end it not only\r\nfoments social revolution within the white world itself, but it also seeks\r\nto enlist the colored races in its grand assault on civilization. The\r\nrulers of Soviet Russia are well aware of the profound ferment now going\r\non in colored lands. They watch this ferment with the same terrible glee\r\nthat they watched the Great War and the fiasco of Versailles--and they\r\nplot to turn it to the same profit.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in every quarter of the globe, in Asia, Africa, Latin\r\nAmerica, and the United States, Bolshevik agitators whisper in the ears of\r\ndiscontented colored men their gospel of hatred and revenge. Every\r\nnationalist aspiration, every political grievance, every social\r\ndiscrimination, is fuel for Bolshevism's hellish incitement to racial as\r\nwell as to class war.\r\n\r\nAnd this Bolshevik propaganda has not been in vain. Its results already\r\nshow in the most diverse quarters, and they are ominous for the future.\r\nChina, Japan, Afghanistan, India, Java, Persia, Turkey, Egypt, Brazil,\r\nChile, Peru, Mexico, and the \"black belts\" of our own United States: here\r\nis a partial list of the lands where the Bolshevik leaven in color is\r\nclearly at work.\r\n\r\nBolshevism thus reveals itself as the arch-enemy of civilization and the\r\nrace. Bolshevism is the renegade, the traitor within the gates, who would\r\nbetray the citadel, degrade the very fibre of our being, and ultimately\r\nhurl a rebarbarized, racially impoverished world into the most debased and\r\nhopeless of mongrelizations.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Bolshevism must be crushed out with iron heels, no matter what\r\nthe cost. If this means more war, let it mean more war. We know only too\r\nwell war's dreadful toll, particularly on racial values. But what\r\nwar-losses could compare with the losses inflicted by the living death of\r\nBolshevism? There are some things worse than war, and Bolshevism stands\r\nforemost among those dread alternatives.\r\n\r\nSo ends our survey of the white world as it emerges from the Great War.\r\nThe prospect is not a brilliant one. Weakened and impoverished by\r\nArmageddon, handicapped by an unconstructive peace, and facing internal\r\nBolshevist disaffection which must at all costs be mastered, the white\r\nworld is ill-prepared to confront--the rising tide of color. What that\r\ntide portends will be the subject of the concluding chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART III_\r\n\r\nTHE DELUGE ON THE DIKES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE OUTER DIKES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my first chapter I showed that the rising tide of color to-day finds\r\nitself confronted by dikes erected by the white race during the centuries\r\nof its expansion. The reader will also remember that white expansion has\r\ntaken two forms: settlement and political control. These two phases differ\r\nprofoundly in character. Areas of settlement like North America have\r\nbecome integral portions of the white world. On the other hand, regions of\r\npolitical control like India are merely white dependencies, highly\r\nvaluable perhaps, yet in the last analysis held by title of the sword.\r\n\r\nBetween these clearly contrasted categories lies an intermediate class of\r\nterritories typified by South Africa, where whites have settled in large\r\nnumbers without displacing the native populations. Lastly, there exist\r\ncertain white territories which may be called \"enclaves.\" These enclaves\r\nhave become thoroughly white by settlement, yet they are so distant from\r\nthe main body of the white world and so contiguous to colored race-areas\r\nthat white tenure does not possess that security which settlement and\r\ndisplacement of the aborigines normally confer. Australia typifies this\r\nanomalous class of cases.\r\n\r\nThe white defenses against the colored tide can be divided into what may\r\nbe termed the \"outer\" and the \"inner\" dikes. The outer dikes (the regions\r\nof white political control) contain no settled white population, so that\r\ntheir abandonment, whatever the political or economic loss, would not\r\ndirectly affect white race-integrity. The question of their retention or\r\nabandonment should therefore (save in a few exceptional cases) be judged\r\nby political, economic, or strategic considerations. The inner dikes (the\r\nareas of white settlement), however, are a very different matter. Peopled\r\nas they are wholly or largely by whites, they have become parts of the\r\nrace-heritage, which should be defended to the last extremity no matter if\r\nthe costs involved are greater than their mere economic value would\r\nwarrant. They are the true bulwarks of the race, the patrimony of future\r\ngenerations who have a right to demand of us that they shall be born white\r\nin a white man's land. Ill will it fare if ever our race should close its\r\nears to this most elemental call of the blood. Then, indeed, would be\r\nmanifest the writing on the wall.\r\n\r\nThat issue, however, is reserved for the next chapter. Let us here examine\r\nthe matter of the outer dikes--the regions of white political control.\r\nThere, where the white man is not settler but suzerain, his suzerainty\r\nshould, in the last analysis, depend on the character of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nRight here, let us clear away the doctrinaire pedantry that commonly\r\nobscures discussion about the retention or abandonment of white political\r\ncontrol over racially non-white regions. Argument usually tends to\r\ncrystallize around two antitheses. On the one side are the doctrinaire\r\nliberals, who maintain the \"imprescriptible right\" of every human group to\r\nattain independence, and of every sovereign state to retain independence.\r\nOn the opposite side are the doctrinaire imperialists, who maintain the\r\nequally imprescriptible right of their particular nation to \"vital\r\nexpansion\" regardless of injuries thereby inflicted upon other nations.\r\n\r\nNow I submit that both these assumptions are unwarranted. There is no\r\n\"imprescriptible right\" to either independence or empire. It depends on\r\nthe realities of each particular case. The extreme cases at either end of\r\nthe scale can be adjudged offhand by ordinary common sense. No one except\r\na doctrinaire liberal would be likely to assert that the Andaman Islanders\r\nhad an imprescriptible right to independence, or that Haiti, which owed\r\nits independence only to a turn in European politics,[136] should forever\r\nremain a sovereign--international nuisance. On the other hand, the whole\r\nworld (with the exception of Teutonic imperialists) denounced Germany's\r\nattempt to swallow highly civilized Belgium as a crime against humanity.\r\n\r\nIn other words: realities, not abstract theories, decide. That does not\r\nplease the doctrinaires, who insist on setting up Procrustean beds of\r\ntheory on which realities should be racked or crammed. It does, however,\r\nconform to the dictates of nature, which decree that what is attuned shall\r\nlive while the disharmonic and degenerate shall pass away. And nature\r\nusually has the last word.\r\n\r\nSurveying the regions of white political control over non-white peoples in\r\nthis realistic way, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of doctrinaire theory\r\nand blind prejudice, we may arrive at a series of conclusions which,\r\nthough lacking the trim symmetry of the idealogue, will correspond to the\r\nfacts in the various cases.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: the white man will have to recognize that the\r\npractically absolute world-dominion which he exercised during the\r\nnineteenth century can no longer be maintained. Largely because of that\r\nvery dominion, colored races have been drawn out of their traditional\r\nisolation and have been quickened by white ideas, while the\r\nlife-conserving nature of white rule has everywhere favored colored\r\nmultiplication. These factors have combined to produce a wide-spread\r\nferment which has been clearly visible for the past two decades, and which\r\nis destined to grow more acute in the near future.\r\n\r\nThis ferment would have developed even if the Great War had never\r\noccurred. However, the white world's weakening through Armageddon has\r\nimmensely accelerated the process and has opened up the possibility of\r\nviolent \"short cuts\" which would have mutually disastrous consequences.\r\nEspecially has it evoked in bellicose and fanatical minds the vision of a\r\n\"Pan-Colored\" alliance for the universal overthrow of white hegemony at a\r\nsingle stroke--a dream which would turn into a nightmare of race-war\r\nbeside which the late struggle in Europe would seem the veriest child's\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF THE WHITE RACES]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effective centres of colored unrest are the brown and yellow worlds of\r\nAsia. Both those worlds are not merely in negative opposition to white\r\nhegemony, but are experiencing a real _renaissance_ whose genuineness is\r\nbest attested by the fact that it is a faithful replica of similar\r\nmovements in past times. White men must get out of their heads the idea\r\nthat Asiatics are necessarily \"inferior.\" As a matter of fact, while\r\nAsiatics do not seem to possess that sustained constructive power with\r\nwhich the whites, particularly the Nordics, are endowed, the browns and\r\nyellows are yet gifted peoples who have profoundly influenced human\r\nprogress in the past and who undoubtedly will contribute much to\r\nworld-civilization. The Asiatics have by their own efforts built up\r\nadmirable cultures rooted in remote antiquity and worthy of all respect.\r\nThey are to-day once more displaying their innate capacity by not merely\r\nadopting, but adapting, white ideas and methods. That this profound\r\nAsiatic renaissance will eventually result in the substantial elimination\r\nof white political control from Anatolia to the Philippines is as natural\r\nas it is inevitable.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean a precipitate white \"scuttle\" from Asia. Far from it.\r\nIt does mean, however, a candid facing of realities and a basing of policy\r\non realities rather than on prepossessions or prejudices. Unless the white\r\nman does this, he will injure himself more than any one else. If Asia is\r\nto-day really renascent, Asia will ultimately reap the political fruits.\r\nMen worthy of independence will sooner or later get independence. This is\r\nas certain as is the converse truth that men unworthy of independence,\r\nthough they cry for it never so loudly, will either remain subject or will\r\nquickly relapse into subjection should they by some lucky circumstance\r\nobtain what they could only misuse.\r\n\r\nIf, then, Asia deserves to be free, she will be free. The only question\r\nis, how she will attain her freedom. Shall it be an evolutionary process,\r\nin the main peaceful, based upon mutual respect, with mutual recognition\r\nof both increasing Asiatic fitness and white vested interests? Or shall it\r\ncome through cataclysmic revolution? This is the dilemma which those\r\nimperialists should ponder who object to any relaxation of white political\r\ncontrol over Asia because of the \"value\" of the subject regions. That\r\nwhite control over Asiatic lands has been, and still is, immensely\r\nprofitable, cannot be denied. But what basis for this value is there\r\nexcept lack of effective opposition? If real, sustained opposition now\r\ndevelops, if subject Asia becomes chronically rebellious, if its peoples\r\nresolutely boycott white goods--as China and India have shown Asiatics\r\ncapable of doing, will not white control be transformed from an asset into\r\na liability? Above all, let us remember that no race-values are involved.\r\nNo white race-areas would have to be abandoned to non-white domination.\r\nWhite control over Asia is political, and can thus be judged by the\r\ncriteria of material interest undisturbed by the categorical imperative of\r\nrace-duty.\r\n\r\nThe need for sympathetic open-mindedness toward awakening Asia if\r\ncataclysmic disasters are to be averted becomes all the clearer when we\r\nrealize that on important issues lying outside Asia the white world must\r\nresolutely oppose Asiatic desires. We whites should be the more generous\r\nin our attitude toward Asia because imperative reasons of self-protection\r\nrequire us to deny to Asiatics some of their best opportunities in the\r\nouter world.\r\n\r\nIn my opening chapters I discussed the rapid growth of Asiatic populations\r\nand the resultant steadily augmenting outward thrust of surplus Asiatics\r\n(principally yellow men, but also in lesser degree brown men) from\r\novercrowded homelands toward the less-crowded regions of the earth. It is,\r\nin fact, Asiatics, and above all Mongolian Asiatics, who form the first\r\nwaves of the rising tide of color. Unfortunately, the white world cannot\r\npermit this rising tide free scope. White men cannot, under peril of their\r\nvery race-existence, allow wholesale Asiatic immigration into white\r\nrace-areas. This prohibition, which will be discussed in the next chapter,\r\nis already a serious blow to Asiatic aspirations.\r\n\r\nBut the matter does not end there. The white world also cannot permit with\r\nsafety to itself wholesale Asiatic penetration of non-Asiatic colored\r\nregions like black Africa and tropical Latin America. To permit Asiatic\r\ncolonization and ultimate control of these vast territories with their\r\nincalculable resources would be to overturn in favor of Asia the\r\npolitical, the economic, and eventually the racial balance of power in the\r\nworld. At present the white man controls these regions. And he must stand\r\nfast. No other course is possible. Neither black Africa nor mongrel-ruled\r\ntropical America can stand alone. If the white man goes, the Asiatic\r\ncomes--browns to Africa, yellows to Latin America. And there is no reason\r\nunder heaven why we whites should deliberately present Asia with the\r\nrichest regions of the tropics, to our own impoverishment and probable\r\nundoing.\r\n\r\nOur race-duty is therefore clear. We must resolutely oppose both Asiatic\r\npermeation of white race-areas and Asiatic inundation of those non-white,\r\nbut equally non-Asiatic, regions inhabited by the really inferior races.\r\nBut we should also recognize that by taking this attitude we debar\r\nAsiatics from golden opportunities and render impossible the realization\r\nof aspirations intrinsically just as normal and laudable as our own. And,\r\nhaving closed in their faces so many doors of hope, can we refuse to\r\ndiscuss with gifted and capable Asiatics the problem of turning over to\r\nthem the keys of their own house without causing festering hatreds whose\r\npoison may spread far beyond Asia into other colored lands and possibly\r\ninto white lands as well? Neither a Pan-Colored nor a Colored-Bolshevist\r\nalliance are impossibilities, far-fetched though these terms may sound.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, we whites are in no position to indulge in the luxury of\r\nBourbonism. Weakened by Armageddon, hampered by Versailles, and harassed\r\nby Bolshevism, the white world can ill afford to flout legitimate Asiatic\r\naspirations to independence. Our imperialists may argue that this means\r\nabandoning \"outer dikes,\" but I contend that white positions in Asia are\r\nnot protective dikes but strategic blockhouses, built upon the sands\r\nduring the long Asiatic ebb-tide, and which the now rising Asiatic waves\r\nmust ultimately engulf. Is it not the part of wisdom to quit these\r\noutposts before they collapse into the swirling waters? Our true \"outer\r\ndikes\" stand, not in Asia, but in Africa and Latin America. Let us not\r\nexhaust ourselves by stubborn resistance in Asia which in the end must\r\nprove futile. Let us conserve our strength, remembering that by the time\r\nAsia has been submerged the flood should have lost much of its pent-up\r\npower.\r\n\r\nParticularly should this be true of the moral \"imponderables.\" By taking a\r\nreasonable, conciliatory attitude toward Asiatic aspirations to\r\nindependence we would thereby eliminate the moral factors in Asia's\r\npresent hostility toward ourselves. Many Asiatics would still be our foes\r\nfrom resentment at balked expansion, but we should have separated the\r\nsheep from the goats.\r\n\r\nAnd the sheep are the more numerous. There are of course irreconcilables\r\nlike Japanese imperialists and Pan-Islamic fanatics who would like to\r\nupset the whole world. However, taken by and large, Asia is peopled\r\nneither by fire-eating jingoes nor howling dervishes. The average Asiatic\r\nis by nature less restless, less ambitious, and consequently less\r\naggressive than ourselves. To-day Asiatics are everywhere aroused by a\r\nwhole complex of stimuli like overcrowding, white domination, and white\r\ndenial of nationalistic aspirations, to an access of hatred and fury.\r\nThose last-mentioned stimuli to anti-white hostility we can remove. The\r\nfirst-mentioned cause of hostility--over-population--we cannot remove.\r\nOnly the Asiatic himself can do that by controlling his reckless\r\nprocreation. Of course over-population is of itself a sufficiently serious\r\nprovoker of trouble. There is no more certain breeder of strife than the\r\nexpansive urge of a fast-breeding people. Nevertheless, this hostile\r\nstimulus applies primarily to yellow Asia. Brown Asia, once free or\r\nclearly on the road to freedom, would be either satisfied or engrossed in\r\nits intestine broils. At any rate, the twin spectres of a Pan-Asian or a\r\nPan-Colored alliance would probably vanish like a mirage of the desert,\r\nand the white world would be far better able to deal with yellow pressure\r\non its race-frontiers--no light task, weakened and distracted as the\r\nwhite world finds itself to-day.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no such wise foresight seems to have been vouchsafed our\r\nstatesmen. Imperialistic secret treaties formed the basis for Versailles's\r\ntreatment of Asiatic questions, and those treaties were drawn precisely as\r\nthough Armageddon were a skirmish and Asia the sleeping giant of a century\r\nago. Upon the brown world, in particular, white domination was riveted\r\nrather than relaxed.\r\n\r\nThis amazing disregard of present-day realities augurs ill for the future.\r\nIndeed, its evil first-fruits are already apparent. The brown world,\r\nconvinced that its aspirations can be realized only by force, turns to the\r\nyellow world and listens to Bolshevik propaganda, while Pan-Islamism\r\nredoubles its efforts in Africa.\r\n\r\nThus is once more manifest the diplomatic bankruptcy of Versailles. The\r\nwhite man, like King Canute, seats himself upon the tidal sands and bids\r\nthe waves be stayed. He will be lucky if he escapes merely with wet\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE INNER DIKES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the frontiers of the white world--to its true frontiers,\r\nmarked, not by boundary-stones, but by flesh and blood. These frontiers\r\nare not continuous: far from the European homeland, some run in remote\r\nquarters of the earth, sundered by vast stretches of ocean and connected\r\nonly by the slate-gray thread of sea-power--the master-talisman which the\r\nwhite man still grasps firmly in his hand.\r\n\r\nBut against these race-frontiers--these \"inner dikes\"--the rising tide of\r\ncolor has for decades been beating, and will beat yet more fiercely as\r\ncongesting population, quickened self-consciousness, and heightened sense\r\nof power impel the colored world to expansion and dominion. Above the\r\neastern horizon the dark storm-clouds lower, and the weakened, distracted\r\nwhite world must soon face a colored peril threatening its integrity and\r\nperhaps its existence. This colored peril has three facets: the peril of\r\narms, the peril of markets, and the peril of migration. All three contain\r\nominous potentialities, both singly and in combination. Let us review them\r\nin turn, to appraise their dynamic possibilities.\r\n\r\nFirst, the peril of arms. The military potencies of the colored races have\r\nbeen the subject of earnest, and frequently alarmist, speculation for the\r\npast twenty years, particularly since the Russo-Japanese War. The\r\nexciting effects of Pan-Islamism upon the warlike peoples of Asia and\r\nAfrica have been frequently discussed, while the \"Yellow Peril\" has long\r\nbeen a journalistic commonplace.\r\n\r\nHow shall we appraise the colored peril of arms? On the whole, it would\r\nappear as though the colored military danger, in its isolated, purely\r\naggressive aspect, had been exaggerated. Visions of a united Asia, rising\r\nsuddenly in fanatic frenzy and hurling brown and yellow myriads upon the\r\nwhite West _seem_ to be the products of superheated imaginations. I say\r\n\"seem,\" because there are unquestionably mysterious emotional depths in\r\nthe Asiatic soul which may yet justify the prophets of cataclysmic war. As\r\nHyndman says: \"With all the facts before us, and with prejudice thrown\r\naside, we are still unable to lay bare the causes of the gigantic Asian\r\nmovements of the past. They were certainly not all economic in their\r\norigin, unless we stretch the boundaries of theory so far as to include\r\nthe massacre of whole populations and the destruction of their wealth\r\nwithin the limits of the invaders' desire for material gain. And, whether\r\nthese movements arose from material or emotional causes, they have been\r\nbefore, and they may occur again. Forecast here is impossible. A new\r\nMohammed is quite as likely to make his appearance as a new Buddha, a\r\nreborn Confucius, or a modern Christ.... Asia raided and scourged Europe\r\nfor more than a thousand years. Now, for five hundred years, the\r\ncounter-attack of Europe upon Asia has been steadily going on, and it may\r\nbe that the land of long memories will cherish some desire to avenge this\r\nperiod of wrong and rapine in turn. The seed of hatred has already been\r\nbut too well sown.\"[137]\r\n\r\nOf course, on this particular point, forecast is, indeed, impossible.\r\nNevertheless, the point should be noted, for Asiatic war-fever may appear,\r\nif not in isolation, then in conjunction with other stimuli to warlike\r\naction, like population-pressure or imperialistic ambition, which to-day\r\nexist and whose amplitude can be approximately gauged. We have already\r\nanalyzed the military potencies of Pan-Islamism and Japan, and China also\r\nshould not be forgotten. Pacifist though China has long been, she has had\r\nher bellicose moments in the past and may have them in the future. Should\r\nthis occur, China, as the world's greatest reservoir of intelligent\r\nman-power, would be immensely formidable. Pearson visualizes a China\r\n\"become an aggressive military power, sending out her armies in millions\r\nto cross the Himalayas and traverse the Steppes, or occupying the islands\r\nand the northern parts of Australia, by pouring in immigrants protected by\r\nfleets. Luther's old name for the Turks, that they were 'the people of the\r\nwrath of God,' may receive a new and terrible application.\"[138]\r\n\r\nGranted that the Chinese will never become the fighting equals of the\r\nworld's warrior races, their incredible numbers combined with their\r\ntenacious vitality might overcome opponents individually their superiors.\r\nSays Professor Ross: \"To the West the toughness of the Chinese physique\r\nmay have a sinister military significance. Nobody fears lest in a stand-up\r\nfight Chinese troops could whip an equal number of well-conditioned white\r\ntroops. But few battles are fought by men fresh from tent and mess. In the\r\ncourse of a prolonged campaign involving irregular provisioning, bad\r\ndrinking-water, lying out, loss of sleep, exhausting marches, exposure,\r\nexcitement, and anxiety, it may be that the white soldiers would be worn\r\ndown worse than the yellow soldiers. In that case the hardier men with\r\nless of the martial spirit might in the closing grapple beat the better\r\nfighters with the less endurance.\"[139]\r\n\r\nThe potentialities of the Chinese soldier would acquire vastly greater\r\nsignificance if China should be thoroughly subjugated by, or solidly\r\nleagued to, ambitious and militaristic Japan. The combined military\r\nenergies of the Far East, welded into an aggressive unity, would be a\r\nweapon of tremendous striking-power.\r\n\r\nThe colored peril of arms may thus be summarized: The brown and yellow\r\nraces possess great military potentialities. These (barring the action of\r\ncertain ill-understood emotional stimuli) are unlikely to flame out in\r\nspontaneous fanaticism; but, on the other hand, they are very likely to\r\nbe mobilized for political reasons like revolt against white dominion or\r\nfor social reasons like over-population. The black race offers no real\r\ndanger except as the tool of Pan-Islamism. As for the red men of the\r\nAmericas, they are of merely local significance.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to examine the economic facet of the colored peril: the\r\nindustrial-mercantile phase. In the second part of this volume I showed\r\nthe profound effect of the \"industrial revolution\" in furthering white\r\nworld-supremacy, and I pointed out the tremendous advantages accruing to\r\nthe white world from exploitation of undeveloped colored lands and from\r\nexports of manufactured goods to colored markets. The prodigious wealth\r\nthereby amassed has been a prime cause of white prosperity, has buttressed\r\nthe maintenance of white world-hegemony, and has made possible much of the\r\nprodigious increase of white population.\r\n\r\nWe little realize what the loss of these advantages would mean. As a\r\nmatter of fact, it would mean throughout the white world diminished\r\nprosperity, lessened political and military strength, and such relative\r\neconomic and social stagnation as would depress national vigor and check\r\npopulation. It is even possible to visualize a white world reverting to\r\nthe condition of Europe in the fifteenth century--thrown back upon itself,\r\non the defensive, and with a static rather than a progressive\r\ncivilization. Such conditions could of course occur only as the result of\r\ncolored military and industrial triumphs of the most sweeping character.\r\nBut the possibility exists, nevertheless, as I shall endeavor to show.\r\n\r\nDown to the close of the nineteenth century white supremacy was as\r\nabsolute in industry as it was in politics and war. Even the civilized\r\nbrown and yellow peoples were negligible from the industrial point of\r\nview. Asia was economically on an agricultural basis. Such industries as\r\nshe possessed were still in the \"house-industry\" stage, and her products,\r\nwhile often exquisite in quality, were produced by such slow, antiquated\r\nmethods that their quantity was limited and their market-price relatively\r\nhigh. Despite very low wages, Asiatic products not only could not compete\r\nin the world-market with European and American machine-made, mass-produced\r\narticles, but were hard hit in their home-markets as well. The way in\r\nwhich an ancient Asiatic handicraft like the Indian textiles was literally\r\nannihilated by the destructive competition of Lancashire cottons is only\r\none of many similar instances.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the twentieth century, however, Asia began to show\r\nsigns of an economic activity as striking in its way as the activity which\r\nAsia was displaying in idealistic and political fields. Japan had already\r\nlaid the foundations of her flourishing industrial life based on the most\r\nup-to-date Western models, while in other Asiatic lands, notably in China\r\nand India, the whir of machinery and the smoke of tall factory chimneys\r\nproclaimed that the East was fathoming the industrial secrets of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nWhat Asiatics were seeking in their industrial revival was well expressed\r\na decade ago by a Hindu, who wrote in a leading Indian periodical: \"In one\r\nrespect the Orient is really menacing the West, and so earnest and\r\nopen-minded is Asia that no pretense or apology whatever is made about it.\r\nThe Easterner has thrown down the industrial gantlet, and from now on Asia\r\nis destined to witness a progressively intense trade warfare, the\r\nOccidental scrambling to retain his hold on the markets of the East, and\r\nthe Oriental endeavoring to beat him in a battle in which heretofore he\r\nhas been an easy victor.... In competing with the Occidental\r\ncommercialists, the Oriental has awakened to a dynamic realization of the\r\nfutility of pitting unimproved machinery and methods against modern\r\nmethods and appliances. Casting aside his former sense of\r\nself-complacency, he is studying the sciences and arts that have given the\r\nWest its material prosperity. He is putting the results of his\r\ninvestigations to practical use, as a rule, recasting the Occidental\r\nmethods and tools to suit his peculiar needs, and in some instances\r\nimproving upon them.\"[140]\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of this Hindu statement of Asia's industrial awakening is\r\nindorsed by the statements of white observers. At the very moment when the\r\nabove article was penned, an American economic writer, Clarence Poe, was\r\nmaking a study tour of the Orient, from which he brought back the\r\nfollowing report: \"The real cause of Asia's poverty lies in just two\r\nthings: the failure of Asiatic governments to educate their people, and\r\nthe failure of the people to increase their productive capacity by the use\r\nof machinery. Ignorance and lack of machinery are responsible for Asia's\r\npoverty; knowledge and modern tools are responsible for America's\r\nprosperity.\" But, continues Mr. Poe, we must watch out. Asia now realizes\r\nthese things and is doing much to remedy the situation. Hence, \"we must\r\nface in ever-increasing degree the rivalry of awakening peoples who are\r\nstrong with the strength that comes from struggle with poverty and\r\nhardship, and who have set themselves to master and apply all our secrets\r\nin the coming world-struggle for industrial supremacy and for racial\r\nreadjustment.\"[141] And more recently another American observer of Asiatic\r\neconomic conditions reports: \"All Asia is being permeated with modern\r\nindustry and present-day mechanical progress.\"[142]\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the momentous possibilities involved in the industrial\r\nawakening of China. China is not merely the most populous of lands,\r\ncontaining as it does nearly one-fourth of all the human beings on earth,\r\nbut it is also dowered with immense natural resources, notably coal and\r\niron--the prime requisites of modern industrial life. Hitherto China has\r\nbeen on an agricultural basis, with virtually no exploitation of her\r\nmineral wealth and with no industry in the modern sense. But the day when\r\nany considerable fraction of China's laborious millions turn from the\r\nplough and handicrafts to the factory must see a portentous reaction in\r\nthe most distant markets.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, Professor Pearson forecast China's imminent industrial\r\ntransformation. \"Does any one doubt,\" he asks, \"that the day is at hand\r\nwhen China will have cheap fuel from her coal-mines, cheap transport by\r\nrailways and steamers, and will have founded technical schools to develop\r\nher industries? Whenever that day comes, she may wrest the control of the\r\nworld's markets, especially throughout Asia, from England and\r\nGermany.\"[143]\r\n\r\nMuch of what Professor Pearson prophesied has already come to pass, for\r\nChina to-day has the beginnings of a promising industrial life. Even a\r\ndecade ago Professor Ross wrote of industrial conditions there:\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly the cheapness of Chinese labor is something to make a factory\r\nowner's mouth water. The women reelers in the silk filatures of Shanghai\r\nget from eight to eleven cents for eleven hours of work. But Shanghai is\r\ndear; and, besides, everybody there complains that the laborers are\r\nknowing and spoiled. In the steel works at Hanyang common labor gets three\r\ndollars a month, just a tenth of what raw Slavs command in the South\r\nChicago iron-works. Skilled mechanics get from eight to twelve dollars. In\r\na coal-mine near Ichang a thousand miles up the Yangtse the coolie\r\nreceives one cent for carrying a 400-pound load of coal on his back down\r\nto the river a mile and a half away. He averages ten loads a day but must\r\nrest every other week. The miners get seven cents a day and found; that\r\nis, a cent's worth of rice and meal. They work eleven hours a day up to\r\ntheir knees in water, and all have swollen legs. After a week of it they\r\nhave to lie off a couple of days. No wonder the cost of this coal\r\n(semi-bituminous) at the pit's mouth is only thirty-five cents a ton. At\r\nChengtu servants get a dollar and a half a month and find themselves.\r\nAcross Szechuan lusty coolies were glad to carry our chairs half a day for\r\nfour cents each. In Sianfu the common coolie gets three cents a day and\r\nfeeds himself, or eighty cents a month. Through Shansi roving harvesters\r\nwere earning from four to twelve cents a day, and farm-hands got five or\r\nsix dollars a year and their keep. Speaking broadly, in any part of the\r\nempire, willing laborers of fair intelligence may be had in any number at\r\nfrom eight to fifteen cents a day.\r\n\r\n\"With an ocean of such labor power to draw on, China would appear to be on\r\nthe eve of a manufacturing development that will act like a continental\r\nupheaval in changing the trade map of the world. The impression is\r\ndeepened by the tale of industries that have already sprung up.\"[144]\r\n\r\nOf course there is another side to the story. Low wages alone do not\r\ninsure cheap production. As Professor Ross remarks: \"For all his native\r\ncapacity, the coolie will need a long course of schooling, industrial\r\ntraining, and factory atmosphere before he inches up abreast of the German\r\nor American working man.\"[145] In the technical and directing staffs there\r\nis the same absence of the modern industrial spirit, resulting in chronic\r\nmismanagement, while Chinese industry is further handicapped by\r\ntraditional evils like \"squeeze,\" nepotism, lust for quick profits, and\r\nincapacity for sustained business team-play. These failings are not\r\npeculiar to China; they hamper the industrial development of other Asiatic\r\ncountries, notably India. Still, the way in which Japanese industry, with\r\nall its faults, is perfecting both its technic and its methods shows that\r\nthese failings will be gradually overcome and indicates that within a\r\ngeneration Asiatic industry will probably be sufficiently advanced to\r\nsupply at least the Asiatic home-markets with most of the staple\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nThus it looks as though white manufactures will tend to be progressively\r\neliminated from Asiatic markets, even under conditions of absolutely free\r\ncompetition. But it is a very moot point whether competition will remain\r\nfree--whether, on the contrary, white wares will not be increasingly\r\npenalized. The Asiatic takes a keen interest in his industrial development\r\nand consciously favors it even where whites are in political control. The\r\n\"swadeshi\" movement in India is a good example, while the Chinese and\r\nEgyptian boycotts of foreign as against native goods are further\r\ninstances in point. The Japanese have supplemented these spontaneous\r\npopular movements by systematic governmental discrimination in favor of\r\nJapanese products and the elimination of white competition from Japan and\r\nits dependencies. This Japanese policy has been markedly successful, and\r\nshould Japan's present hegemony over China be perpetuated the white man\r\nmay soon find himself economically as well as politically expelled from\r\nthe whole Far East.\r\n\r\nA decade ago Putnam Weale wrote warningly: \"If China is forced, owing to\r\nthe short-sighted diplomacy of those for whom the question has really\r\nsupreme importance, to make common cause with Japan as a _pis aller_, then\r\nit may be accepted as inevitable that in the course of time there will be\r\ncreated a _mare clausum_, which will extend from the island of Saghalien\r\ndown to Cochin-China and Siam, including all the island-groups, and the\r\nshores of which will be openly hostile to the white man....\r\n\r\n\"And since there will be no danger from the competition of white workmen,\r\nbut rather from the white man's ships, the white man's merchants, his\r\ninventions, his produce--it will be these which will be subjected to\r\nhumiliating conditions.... It is not a very far cry from tariffs on goods\r\nto tariffs and restrictions on foreign shipping, on foreign merchants, on\r\neverything foreign--restrictions which by imposing vast and unequal\r\nburdens on the activities of aliens will soon totally destroy such\r\nactivities.... What can very easily happen is that the federation of\r\neastern Asia and the yellow races will be finally arranged in such a\r\nmanner as to exclude the white man and his commerce more completely than\r\nany one yet dreams of.\"[146]\r\n\r\nThis latter misfortune may be averted by concerted white action, but it is\r\ndifficult to see how the gradual elimination of white goods from Asiatic\r\nmarkets as the result of successful Asiatic competition can be averted.\r\nCertainly the stubborn maintenance of white political domination over a\r\nrebellious Asia would be no remedy. That would merely intensify swadeshi\r\nboycotts in the subject regions, while in the lands freed from white\r\npolitical control it would further Japan's policy of excluding everything\r\nwhite. If Asiatics resolve to buy their own products instead of ours we\r\nmay as well reconcile ourselves to the loss. Here again frank recognition\r\nof the inevitable will enable us to take a much stronger and more\r\njustifiable position on the larger world-aspects of the problem.\r\n\r\nFor Asia's industrial transformation is destined to cause momentous\r\nreactions in other parts of the globe. If Asiatic industry really does get\r\non an efficient basis, its potentialities are so tremendous that it must\r\npresently not only monopolize the home-markets but also seek to invade\r\nwhite markets as well, thus presenting the white world with commercial and\r\neconomic problems as unwelcome as they will be novel.\r\n\r\nAgain, industrialization will in some respects aggravate Asiatic longings\r\nfor migration and dominion. In my opening pages I mentioned\r\nindustrialization as a probable reliever of population-pressure in Asiatic\r\ncountries by affording new livelihoods to the congested masses. This is\r\ntrue. But, looking a trifle farther, we can also see that\r\nindustrialization would stimulate a further prodigious increase of\r\npopulation. Consider the growth of Europe's population during the\r\nnineteenth century under the stimulus of the industrial revolution, making\r\npossible the existence in our industrialized Europe of three times as many\r\npeople as existed in the agricultural Europe of a hundred years ago. Why\r\nshould not a similar development occur in Asia? To-day Asia, though still\r\nupon a basis as agricultural as eighteenth-century Europe, contains fully\r\n900,000,000 people. That even a partially industrialized Asia might\r\nsupport twice that number would (judging by the European precedent) be far\r\nfrom improbable.\r\n\r\nBut this would mean vastly increased incentives to expansion--commercial,\r\npolitical, racial--beyond the bounds of Asia. It would mean intensified\r\nencroachments, not only upon areas of white settlement, but perhaps even\r\nmore upon non-Asiatic colored regions of white political control like\r\nAfrica and tropical America. Here again we see why the white man, however\r\nconciliatory in Asia, must stand like flint in Africa and Latin America.\r\nTo allow the whole tropic belt clear round the world to pass into Asiatic\r\nhands would practically spell white race-suicide.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pearson paints a truly terrible picture of the stagnation and\r\nhopelessness which would ensue. \"Let us conceive,\" he writes, \"the leading\r\nEuropean nations to be stationary, while the black and yellow belt,\r\nincluding China, Malaysia, India, central Africa, and tropical America, is\r\nall teeming with life, developed by industrial enterprise, fairly well\r\nadministered by native governments, and owning the better part of the\r\ncarrying trade of the world. Can any one suppose that, in such a condition\r\nof political society, the habitual temper of mind in Europe would not be\r\nprofoundly changed? Depression, hopelessness, a disregard of invention and\r\nimprovement, would replace the sanguine confidence of races that at\r\npresent are always panting for new worlds to conquer. Here and there, it\r\nmay be, the more adventurous would profit by the traditions of old\r\nsupremacy to get their services accepted in the new nations, but as a rule\r\nthere would be no outlet for energy, no future for statesmanship. The\r\ndespondency of the English people, when their dream of conquest in France\r\nwas dissipated, was attended with a complete decay of thought, with civil\r\nwar, and with a standing still, or perhaps a decline of population, and to\r\na less degree of wealth.... It is conceivable that our later world may\r\nfind itself deprived of all that is valued on earth, of the pageantry of\r\nsubject provinces and the reality of commerce, while it has neither a\r\ndisinterred literature to amuse it nor a vitalized religion to give it\r\nspiritual strength.\"[147]\r\n\r\nTo sum up: The economic phase of the colored peril, though not yet a\r\nmajor factor, must still be seriously reckoned with by forward-looking\r\nstatesmanship as something which will increasingly complicate the\r\nrelations of the white and non-white worlds. In fact, even to-day it tends\r\nto intensify Asiatic desires for expansion, and thus exacerbates the\r\nthird, or migratory, phase of the colored peril, which is already upon us.\r\n\r\nThe question of Asiatic immigration is incomparably the greatest external\r\nproblem which faces the white world. Supreme phase of the colored peril,\r\nit already presses, and is destined to press harder in the near future. It\r\ninfinitely transcends the peril of arms or markets, since it threatens not\r\nmerely our supremacy or prosperity but our very race-existence, the\r\nwellsprings of being, the sacred heritage of our children.\r\n\r\nThat this is no overstatement of the issue, a bare recital of a few\r\nbiological axioms will show. We have already seen that nothing is more\r\n_unstable_ than the racial make-up of a people, while, conversely, nothing\r\nis more _unchanging_ than the racial divisions of mankind. We have seen\r\nthat true amalgamation is possible only between members of the same\r\nrace-stock, while in crossings between stocks even as relatively near\r\ntogether as the main divisions of the white species, the race-characters\r\ndo not really fuse but remain distinct in the mixed offspring and tend\r\nconstantly to resort themselves as pure types by Mendelian inheritance.\r\nThus a country inhabited by a mixed population is really inhabited by\r\ndifferent races, one of which always tends to dominate and breed the\r\nother out--the outbred strains being lost to the world forever.\r\n\r\nNow, since the various human stocks differ widely in genetic worth,\r\nnothing should be more carefully studied than the relative values of the\r\ndifferent strains in a population, and nothing should be more rigidly\r\nscrutinized than new strains seeking to add themselves to a population,\r\nbecause such new strains may hold simply incalculable potentialities for\r\ngood or for evil. The potential reproductive powers of any stock are\r\nalmost unlimited. Therefore the introduction of even a small group of\r\nprolific and adaptable but racially undesirable aliens may result in their\r\nsubsequent prodigious multiplication, thereby either replacing better\r\nnative stocks or degrading these by the injection of inferior blood.\r\n\r\nThe admission of aliens should, indeed, be regarded just as solemnly as\r\nthe begetting of children, for the racial effect is essentially the same.\r\nThere is no more damning indictment of our lopsided, materialistic\r\ncivilization than the way in which, throughout the nineteenth century,\r\nimmigration was almost universally regarded, not from the racial, but from\r\nthe material point of view, the immigrant being viewed not as a creator of\r\nrace-values but as a mere vocal tool for the production of material\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nImmigration is thus, from the racial standpoint, a form of procreation,\r\nand like the more immediate form of procreation it may be either the\r\ngreatest blessing or the greatest curse. Human history is largely the\r\nstory of migrations, making now for good and now for ill. Migration\r\npeopled Europe with superior white stocks displacing ape-like aborigines,\r\nand settled North America with Nordics instead of nomad redskins. But\r\nmigration also bastardized the Roman world with Levantine mongrels,\r\ndrowned the West Indies under a black tide, and is filling our own land\r\nwith the sweepings of the European east and south.\r\n\r\nMigration, like other natural movements, is of itself a blind force. It is\r\nman's divine privilege as well as duty, having been vouchsafed knowledge\r\nof the laws of life, to direct these blind forces, rejecting the bad and\r\nselecting the good for the evolution of higher and nobler destinies.\r\n\r\nColored immigration is merely the most extreme phase of a phenomenon which\r\nhas already moulded prodigiously the development of the white world. In\r\nfact, before discussing the specific problems of colored immigration, it\r\nwould be well to survey the effects of the immigration of various white\r\nstocks. When we have grasped the momentous changes wrought by the\r\nintroduction of even relatively near-related and hence relatively\r\nassimilable strains, we will be better able to realize the far more\r\nmomentous consequences which the introduction of colored stocks into white\r\nlands would entail.\r\n\r\nThe racial effects of immigration are ably summarized by that lifelong\r\nstudent of immigration problems, Prescott F. Hall. These effects are, he\r\ntruly remarks, \"more far-reaching and potent than all others. The\r\ngovernment, the state, society, industry, the political party, social and\r\npolitical ideals, all are concepts and conventions created by individual\r\nmen; and when individuals change these change with them. Recent\r\ndiscoveries in biology show that in the long run heredity is far more\r\nimportant than environment or education; for though the latter can\r\ndevelop, it cannot create. They also show what can be done in a few years\r\nin altering species, and in producing new ones with qualities hitherto\r\nunknown, or unknown in combination.\"[148]\r\n\r\nThe ways in which admixture of alien blood can modify or even destroy the\r\nvery soul of a people have been fully analyzed both by biologists and by\r\nsocial psychologists like Doctor Gustave Le Bon.[149] The way in which\r\nwholesale immigration, even though mainly white, has already profoundly\r\nmodified American national character is succinctly stated by Mr. Eliot\r\nNorton. \"If,\" he writes, \"one considers the American people from, say,\r\n1775 to 1860, it is clear that a well-defined national character was in\r\nprocess of formation. What variations there were, were all of the same\r\ntype, and these variations would have slowly grown less and less marked.\r\nIt needs little study to see of what great value to any body of men,\r\nwomen, and children a national or racial type is. It furnishes a standard\r\nof conduct by which any one can set his course. The world is a difficult\r\nplace in which to live, and to establish moral standards has been one of\r\nthe chief occupations of mankind. Without such standards, man feels as a\r\nmariner without a compass. Religions, rules, laws, and customs are only\r\nthe national character in the form of standards of conduct. Now national\r\ncharacter can be formed only in a population which is stable. The repeated\r\nintroduction into a body of men of other men of different type or types\r\ncannot but tend to prevent its formation. Thus the 19,000,000 of\r\nimmigrants that have landed have tended to break up the type which was\r\nforming, and to make the formation of any other type difficult. Every\r\nmillion more will only intensify this result, and the absence of a\r\nnational character is a loss to every man, woman, and child. It will show\r\nitself in our religions, rules of conduct, in our laws, in our\r\ncustoms.\"[150]\r\n\r\nThe vital necessity of restriction and selection in immigration to\r\nconserve and build race-values is thus set forth by Mr. Hall:\r\n\r\n\"There is one aspect of immigration restriction in the various countries\r\nwhich does not often receive much attention; namely, the possibility of\r\nits use as a method of world-eugenics. Most persons think of migration in\r\nterms of space--as the moving of a certain number of people from one part\r\nof the earth's surface to another. Whereas the much more important aspect\r\nof it is that of a functioning in time.\r\n\r\n\"This comes from two facts. The first is that the vacuum left in any\r\ncountry by emigration is rapidly filled up through a rise in the\r\nbirth-rate.... The second fact is that immigration to any country of a\r\ngiven stratum of population tends to sterilize all strata of higher social\r\nand economic levels already in that country. So true is this that nearly\r\nall students of the matter are agreed that the United States would have a\r\nlarger population to-day if there had been no immigration since 1820, and,\r\nit is needless to add, a much more homogeneous population. As long as the\r\npeople of any community are relatively homogeneous, what differences of\r\nwealth and social position there may be do not affect the birth-rate, or\r\ndo so only after a considerable time. But put into that community a number\r\nof immigrants, inferior mentally, socially, and economically, and the\r\nnatives are unwilling to have their children associate with them in work\r\nor social life. They then limit the number of their children in order to\r\ngive them the capital or education to enter occupations in which they will\r\nnot be brought into contact with the new arrivals. This result is quite\r\napparent in New England, where successive waves of immigration from lower\r\nand lower levels have been coming in for eighty years. In the West, the\r\nsame New England stock has a much higher birth-rate, showing that its\r\nfertility is in no way diminished. In the South, where until very recently\r\nthere was no immigration at all, and the only socially inferior race was\r\nclearly separated by the accident of color, the birth-rate has remained\r\nvery high, and the very large families of the colonial period are even now\r\nnot uncommon.\r\n\r\n\"This is not to say that other causes do not contribute to lower the\r\nbirth-rate of a country, for that is an almost world-wide phenomenon. But\r\nthe desire to be separated from inferiors is as strong a motive to\r\nbirth-control as the desire for luxury or to ape one's economic superiors.\r\nRaces follow Gresham's law as to money: the poorer of two kinds in the\r\nsame place tends to supplant the better. Mark you, _supplant_, not drive\r\nout. One of the most common fallacies is the idea that the natives whose\r\nplaces are taken by the lower immigrants are 'driven up' to more\r\nresponsible positions. A few may be pushed up; more are driven to a new\r\nlocality, as happened in the mining regions; _but most are prevented from\r\ncoming into existence at all_.\r\n\r\n\"What is the result, then, of the migration of 1,000,000 persons of lower\r\nlevel into a country where the average is of a higher level? Considering\r\nthe world as a whole, there are, after a few years, 2,000,000 persons of\r\nthe lower type in the world, and probably from 500,000 to 1,000,000 less\r\nof the higher type. The proportion of lower to higher in the country from\r\nwhich the migration goes may remain the same; but in the country receiving\r\nit, it has _risen_. Is the world as a whole the gainer?\r\n\r\n\"Of course the euthenist[151] says at once that these immigrants are\r\nimproved. We may grant that, although the improvement is probably much\r\nexaggerated. You cannot make bad stock into good by changing its meridian,\r\nany more than you can turn a cart-horse into a hunter by putting it into a\r\nfine stable, or make a mongrel into a fine dog by teaching it tricks. But\r\nsuch improvement as there is involves time, expense, and trouble; and,\r\nwhen it is done, has anything been gained? Will any one say that the races\r\nthat have supplanted the old Nordic stock in New England are any better,\r\nor as good, as the descendants of that stock would have been if their\r\nbirth-rate had not been lowered?\r\n\r\n\"Further, in addition to the purely biological aspects of the matter,\r\nthere are certain psychological ones. Although a cosmopolitan atmosphere\r\nfurnishes a certain freedom in which strong congenital talents can\r\ndevelop, it is a question whether as many are not injured as helped by\r\nthis. Indeed, there is considerable evidence to show that for the\r\nproduction of great men, a certain homogeneity of environment is\r\nnecessary. The reason of this is very simple. In a homogeneous community,\r\nopinions on a large number of matters are fixed. The individual does not\r\nhave to attend to such things, but is free to go ahead on some special\r\nline of his own, to concentrate to his limit on his work, even though that\r\nwork be fighting the common opinions.\r\n\r\n\"But in a community of many races, there is either cross-breeding or there\r\nis not. If there is, the children of such cross-breeding are liable to\r\ninherit two souls, two temperaments, two sets of opinions, with the\r\nresult in many cases that they are unable to think or act strongly and\r\nconsistently in any direction. The classic examples are Cuba, Mexico, and\r\nBrazil. On the other hand, if there is no cross-breeding, the diversity\r\nexists in the original races, and in a community full of diverse ideals of\r\nall kinds much of the energy of the higher type of man is dissipated in\r\ntwo ways. First, in the intellectual field there is much more doubt about\r\neverything, and he tends to weigh, discuss, and agitate many more\r\nsubjects, in order to arrive at a conclusion amid the opposing views.\r\nSecond, in practical affairs, much time and strength have to be devoted to\r\nkeeping things going along old lines, which could have been spent in new\r\nresearch and development. In how many of our large cities to-day are men\r\nof the highest type spending their whole time fighting, often in vain, to\r\nmaintain standards of honesty, decency, and order, and in trying to\r\ncompose the various ethnic elements, who should be free to build new\r\nstructures upon the old!\r\n\r\n\"The moral seems to be this: Eugenics among individuals is encouraging the\r\npropagation of the fit, and limiting or preventing the multiplication of\r\nthe unfit. World-eugenics is doing precisely the same thing as to races\r\nconsidered as wholes. Immigration restriction is a species of segregation\r\non a large scale, by which inferior stocks can be prevented from both\r\ndiluting and supplanting good stocks. Just as we isolate bacterial\r\ninvasions, and starve out the bacteria by limiting the area and amount of\r\ntheir food-supply, so we can compel an inferior race to remain in its\r\nnative habitat, where its own multiplication in a limited area will, as\r\nwith all organisms, eventually limit its numbers and therefore its\r\ninfluence. On the other hand, the superior races, more self-limiting than\r\nthe others, with the benefits of more space and nourishment will tend to\r\nstill higher levels.\r\n\r\n\"This result is not merely a selfish benefit to the higher races, but a\r\ngood to the world as a whole. The object is to produce the greatest number\r\nof those fittest not 'for survival' merely, but fittest for all purposes.\r\nThe lower types among men progress, so far as their racial inheritance\r\nallows them to, chiefly by imitation and emulation. The presence of the\r\nhighest development and the highest institutions among any race is a\r\ndistinct benefit to all the others. It is a gift of _psychological\r\nenvironment_ to any one capable of appreciation.\"[152]\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of any advanced and prosperous community maintaining its\r\nsocial standards and handing them down to its posterity in these days of\r\ncheap and rapid transportation except by restrictions upon immigrations is\r\nthus explained by Professor Ross: \"Now that cheap travel stirs the social\r\ndeeps and far-beckoning opportunity fills the steerage, immigration\r\nbecomes ever more serious to the people that hopes to rid itself at least\r\nof slums, 'masses,' and 'submerged.' What is the good of practising\r\nprudence in the family if hungry strangers may crowd in and occupy at the\r\nbanquet table of life the places reserved for its children? Shall it, in\r\norder to relieve the teeming lands of their unemployed, abide in the pit\r\nof wolfish competition and renounce the fair prospect of growth in\r\nsuavity, comfort, and refinement? If not, then the low-pressure society\r\nmust not only slam its doors upon the indraft, but must double-lock them\r\nwith forts and iron-clads, lest they be burst open by assault from some\r\nquarter where 'cannon food' is cheap.\"[153]\r\n\r\nThese admirable summaries of the immigration problem in its world-aspect\r\nare strikingly illustrated by our own country, which may be considered as\r\nthe leading, if not the \"horrible,\" example. Probably few persons fully\r\nappreciate what magnificent racial treasures America possessed at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century. The colonial stock was perhaps the\r\nfinest that nature had evolved since the classic Greeks. It was the very\r\npick of the Nordics of the British Isles and adjacent regions of the\r\nEuropean continent--picked at a time when those countries were more Nordic\r\nthan now, since the industrial revolution had not yet begun and the\r\nconsequent resurgence of the Mediterranean and Alpine elements had not\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nThe immigrants of colonial times were largely exiles for conscience's\r\nsake, while the very process of migration was so difficult and hazardous\r\nthat only persons of courage, initiative, and strong will-power would\r\nvoluntarily face the long voyage overseas to a life of struggle in an\r\nuntamed wilderness haunted by ferocious savages.\r\n\r\nThus the entire process of colonial settlement was one continuous, drastic\r\ncycle of eugenic selection. Only the racially fit ordinarily came, while\r\nthe few unfit who did come were mostly weeded out by the exacting\r\nrequirements of early American life.\r\n\r\nThe eugenic results were magnificent. As Madison Grant well says: \"Nature\r\nhad vouchsafed to the Americans of a century ago the greatest opportunity\r\nin recorded history to produce in the isolation of a continent a powerful\r\nand racially homogeneous people, and had provided for the experiment a\r\npure race of one of the most gifted and vigorous stocks on earth, a stock\r\nfree from the diseases, physical and moral, which have again and again\r\nsapped the vigor of the older lands. Our grandfathers threw away this\r\nopportunity in the blissful ignorance of national childhood and\r\ninexperience.\"[154] The number of great names which America produced at\r\nthe beginning of its national life shows the high level of ability\r\npossessed by this relatively small people (only about 3,000,000 whites in\r\n1790). With our hundred-odd millions we have no such output of genius\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThe opening decades of the nineteenth century seemed to portend for\r\nAmerica the most glorious of futures. For nearly seventy years after the\r\nRevolution, immigration was small, and during that long period of ethnic\r\nisolation the colonial stock, unperturbed by alien influences, adjusted\r\nits cultural differences and began to display the traits of a genuine new\r\ntype, harmonious in basic homogeneity and incalculably rich in racial\r\npromise. The general level of ability continued high and the output of\r\ntalent remained extraordinarily large. Perhaps the best feature of the\r\nnascent \"native American\" race was its strong idealism. Despite the\r\nmaterialistic blight which was then creeping over the white world, the\r\nnative American displayed characteristics more reminiscent of his\r\nElizabethan forebears than of the materialistic Hanoverian Englishman. It\r\nwas a wonderful time--and it was only the dawn!\r\n\r\nBut the full day of that wondrous dawning never came. In the late forties\r\nof the nineteenth century the first waves of the modern immigrant tide\r\nbegan breaking on our shores, and the tide swelled to a veritable deluge\r\nwhich never slackened till temporarily restrained by the late war. This\r\nimmigration, to be sure, first came mainly from northern Europe, was thus\r\nlargely composed of kindred stocks, and contributed many valuable\r\nelements. Only during the last thirty years have we been deluged by the\r\ntruly alien hordes of the European east and south. But, even at its best,\r\nthe immigrant tide could not measure up to the colonial stock _which it\r\ndisplaced_, not reinforced, while latterly it became a menace to the very\r\nexistence of our race, ideals, and institutions. All our slowly acquired\r\nbalance--physical, mental, and spiritual--has been upset, and we to-day\r\nflounder in a veritable Serbonian bog, painfully trying to regain the\r\nsolid ground on which our grandsires confidently stood.\r\n\r\nThe dangerous fallacy in that short-sighted idealism which seeks to make\r\nAmerica the haven of refuge for the poor and oppressed of all lands, and\r\nits evil effects not only on America but on the rest of the world as well,\r\nhas been convincingly exposed by Professor Ross. He has scant patience\r\nwith those social \"uplifters\" whose sympathy with the visible alien at the\r\ngate is so keen that they have no feeling for the _invisible_ children of\r\n_our_ poor who will find the chances gone, nor for those at the gate of\r\nthe to-be, who might have been born, but will not be.\r\n\r\n\"I am not of those,\" he writes, \"who consider humanity and forget the\r\nnation, who pity the living but not the unborn. To me, those who are to\r\ncome after us stretch forth beseeching hands as well as do the masses on\r\nthe other side of the globe. Nor do I regard America as something to be\r\nspent quickly and cheerfully for the benefit of pent-up millions in the\r\nbackward lands. What if we become crowded without their ceasing to be so?\r\nI regard it (America) as a nation whose future may be of unspeakable value\r\nto the rest of mankind, provided that the easier conditions of life here\r\nbe made permanent by high standards of living, institutions, and ideals,\r\nwhich finally may be appropriated by all men. We could have helped the\r\nChinese a little by letting their surplus millions swarm in upon us a\r\ngeneration ago; but we have helped them infinitely more by protecting our\r\nstandards and having something worth their copying when the time\r\ncame.\"[155]\r\n\r\nThe perturbing influence of recent immigration must vex American life for\r\nmany decades. Even if laws are passed to-morrow so drastic as to shut out\r\npermanently the influx of undesirable elements, it will yet take several\r\ngenerations before the combined action of assimilation and elimination\r\nshall have restabilized our population and evolved a new type-norm\r\napproaching in fixity that which was on the point of crystallizing\r\nthree-quarters of a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe biologist Humphrey thus punctures the \"melting-pot\" delusion: \"Our\r\n'melting-pot,'\" he writes, \"would not give us in a thousand years what\r\nenthusiasts expect of it--a _fusing_ of all our various racial elements\r\ninto a new type which shall be the true American. It _will_ give us for\r\nmany generations a perplexing diversity in ancestry, and since our\r\nsuccessors must reach back into their ancestry for characteristics, this\r\ndiversity will increase the uncertainty of their inheritances. They will\r\ninherit no stable blended character, because there is no such thing. They\r\nwill inherit from a mixture of unlike characteristics contributed by\r\nunlike peoples, and in their inheritance they will have certain of these\r\ncharacteristics in full identity, while certain others they will not have\r\nat all.\"[156]\r\n\r\nThus, under even the most favorable circumstances, we are in for\r\ngenerations of racial readjustment--an immense travail, essentially\r\nneedless, since the final product will probably not measure up to the\r\ncolonial standard. We will probably never (unless we adopt positive\r\neugenic measures) be the race we might have been if America had been\r\nreserved for the descendants of the picked Nordics of colonial times.\r\n\r\nBut that is no reason for folding our hands in despairing inaction. On the\r\ncontrary, we should be up and doing, for though some of our race-heritage\r\nhas been lost, more yet remains. We can still be a very great people--if\r\nwe will it so. Heaven be praised, the colonial stock was immensely\r\nprolific before the alien tide wrought its sterilizing havoc. Even to-day\r\nnearly one-half of our population is of the old blood, while many millions\r\nof the immigrant stock are sound in quality and assimilable in kind.\r\nOnly--the immigrant tide must at all costs be stopped and America given a\r\nchance to stabilize her ethnic being. It is the old story of the sibylline\r\nbooks. Some, to be sure, are ashes of the dead past; all the more should\r\nwe conserve the precious volumes which remain.\r\n\r\nOne fact should be clearly understood: If America is not true to her own\r\nrace-soul, she will inevitably lose it, and the brightest star that has\r\nappeared since Hellas will fall like a meteor from the human sky, its\r\nbrilliant radiance fading into the night. \"We Americans,\" says Madison\r\nGrant, \"must realize that the altruistic ideals which have controlled our\r\nsocial development during the past century and the maudlin sentimentalism\r\nthat has made America 'an asylum for the oppressed,' are sweeping the\r\nnation toward a racial abyss. If the melting-pot is allowed to boil\r\nwithout control and we continue to follow our national motto and\r\ndeliberately blind ourselves to 'all distinctions of race, creed, or\r\ncolor,' the type of native American of colonial descent will become as\r\nextinct as the Athenian of the age of Pericles and the Viking of the days\r\nof Rollo.\"[157]\r\n\r\nAnd let us not lay any sacrificial unction to our souls. If we cheat our\r\ncountry and the world of the splendid promise of American life, we shall\r\nhave no one to blame but ourselves, and we shall deserve, not pity, but\r\ncontempt. As Professor Ross well puts it: \"A people that has no more\r\nrespect for its ancestors and no more pride of race than this deserves the\r\nextinction that surely awaits it.\"[158]\r\n\r\nThis extended discussion of the evil effects of even white immigration\r\nhas, in my opinion, been necessary in order to get a proper perspective\r\nfor viewing the problem of colored immigration. For it is perfectly\r\nobvious that if the influx of inferior kindred stocks is bad, the influx\r\nof wholly alien stocks is infinitely worse. When we see the damage wrought\r\nin America, for example, by the coming of persons who, after all, belong\r\nmostly to branches of the white race and who nearly all possess the basic\r\nideals of white civilization, we can grasp the incalculably greater damage\r\nwhich would be wrought by the coming of persons wholly alien in blood and\r\npossessed of idealistic and cultural backgrounds absolutely different from\r\nours. If the white immigrant can gravely disorder the national life, it is\r\nnot too much to say that the colored immigrant would doom it to certain\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThis doom would be all the more certain because of the enormous potential\r\nvolume of colored immigration. Beside it, the white immigrant tide of the\r\npast century would pale into insignificance. Leaving all other parts of\r\nthe colored world out of the present discussion, three Asiatic\r\ncountries--China, Japan, and India--together have a population of nearly\r\n800,000,000. That is practically twice the population of Europe--the\r\nsource of white immigration. And the vast majority of these 800,000,000\r\nAsiatics are potential immigrants into white territories. Their standards\r\nof living are so inconceivably low, their congestion is so painful, and\r\ntheir consequent desire for relief so keen that the high-standard,\r\nrelatively empty white world seems to them a perfect paradise. Only the\r\nbarrier of the white man's veto has prevented a perfect deluge of colored\r\nmen into white lands, and even as it is the desperate seekers after fuller\r\nlife have crept and crawled through every crevice in that barrier, until\r\neven these advance-guards to-day constitute serious local problems along\r\nthe white world's race-frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth of the matter is this: A mighty problem--a planet-wide\r\nproblem--confronts us to-day and will increasingly confront us in the days\r\nto come. Says Putnam Weale: \"A struggle has begun between the white man\r\nand all the other men of the world to decide whether non-white men--that\r\nis, yellow men, or brown men, or black men--may or may not invade the\r\nwhite man's countries in order there to gain their livelihood. The\r\nstandard of living being low in the lands of colored men and high in the\r\nlands of the white man, it has naturally followed that it has been in the\r\nhighest degree attractive for men of color during the past few decades to\r\nproceed to regions where their labor is rewarded on a scale far above\r\ntheir actual requirements--that is, on the white man's scale. This simple\r\neconomic truth creates the inevitable contest which has for years filled\r\nall the countries bordering on the Pacific with great dread; and which, in\r\nspite of the temporary truce which the so-called 'Exclusion Policy' has\r\nnow enforced, will go much farther than it has yet gone.\"[159]\r\n\r\nThe world-wide significance of colored immigration and the momentous\r\nconflicts which it will probably provoke are ably visualized by Professor\r\nRoss.\r\n\r\n\"The rush of developments,\" he writes, \"makes it certain that the vision\r\nof a globe 'lapped in universal law' is premature. If the seers of the\r\nmid-century who looked for the speedy triumph of free trade had read their\r\nMalthus aright, they might have anticipated the tariff barriers that have\r\narisen on all hands within the last thirty years. So, to-day one needs no\r\nprophet's mantle to foresee that presently the world will be cut up with\r\nimmigration barriers which will never be levelled until the intelligent\r\naccommodation of numbers to resources has greatly equalized\r\npopulation-pressure all over the globe.... Dams against the color races,\r\nwith spillways of course for students, merchants, and travellers, will\r\npresently enclose the white man's world. Within this area minor dams will\r\nprotect the high wages of the less prolific peoples against the surplus\r\nlabor of the more prolific.\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly, every small-family nation will try to raise such a dam, and\r\nevery big-family nation will try to break it down. The outlook for peace\r\nand disarmament is, therefore, far from bright. One needs but compare the\r\npopulation-pressures in France, Germany, Russia, and Japan to realize\r\nthat, even to-day, the real enemy of the dove of peace is not the eagle of\r\npride or the vulture of greed, but the stork!\r\n\r\n\"The great point of doubt in birth restriction is the ability of the\r\nWestern nations to retain control of the vast African, Australasian, and\r\nSouth American areas they have staked out as preserves to be peopled at\r\ntheir leisure with the diminishing overflow of their population. If\r\nunderbreeding should leave them without the military strength that alone\r\ncan defend their far-flung frontiers in the southern hemisphere, those\r\nhuge underdeveloped regions will assuredly be filled with the children of\r\nthe brown and the yellow races.\"[160]\r\n\r\nThus, white men, of whatever country and however far removed from personal\r\ncontact with colored competitors, must realize that the question of\r\ncolored immigration vitally concerns every white man, woman, and child;\r\nbecause nowhere--_absolutely nowhere_--can white labor compete on equal\r\nterms with colored immigrant labor. The grim truth is that there are\r\nenough hard-working colored men to swamp the whole white world.\r\n\r\nNo palliatives will serve to mitigate the ultimate issue, for if the white\r\nrace should to-day surrender enough of its frontiers to ease the existing\r\ncolored population-pressure, so quickly would these surrendered regions be\r\nswamped, and so rapidly would the fast-breeding colored races fill the\r\nhomeland gaps, that in a very short time the diminished white world would\r\nbe faced with an even louder colored clamor for admittance--backed by an\r\nincreased power to enforce the colored will.\r\n\r\nThe profoundly destructive effects of colored competition upon white\r\nstandards of labor and living has long been admitted by all candid\r\nstudents of the problem. So warm a champion of Asiatics as Mr. Hyndman\r\nacknowledges that \"the white workers cannot hold their own permanently\r\nagainst Chinese competition in the labor market. The lower standard of\r\nlife, the greater persistence, the superior education of the Chinese will\r\nbeat them, and will continue to beat them.\"[161]\r\n\r\nWherever the white man has been exposed to colored competition,\r\nparticularly Asiatic competition, the story is the same. Says the\r\nAustralian Professor Pearson: \"No one in California or Australia, where\r\nthe effects of Chinese competition have been studied, has, I believe, the\r\nsmallest doubt that Chinese laborers, if allowed to come in freely, could\r\nstarve all the white men in either country out of it, or force them to\r\nsubmit to harder work and a much lower standard of wages.\"[162]\r\n\r\nAnd a South African, writing of the effects of Hindu immigration into\r\nNatal, remarks in similar vein: \"The condition of South Africa--especially\r\nof Natal--is a warning to other lands to bar Asiatic immigrants.... Both\r\neconomically and socially the presence of a large Oriental population is\r\nbad. The Asiatics either force out the white workers, or compel the latter\r\nto live down to the Asiatic level. There must be a marked deterioration\r\namongst the white working classes, which renders useless a great deal of\r\nthe effort made in educational work. The white population is educated and\r\ntrained according to the best ideas of the highest form of Western\r\ncivilization--and has to compete for a livelihood against Asiatics! In\r\nSouth Africa this competition is driving out the white working class,\r\nbecause the average European cannot live down to the Asiatic level--and if\r\nit is essential that the European must do so, for the sake of his own\r\nhappiness, do not educate him up to better things. If cheapness is the\r\nonly consideration, if low wages are to come before everything else, then\r\nit is not only waste of money, but absolute cruelty, to inspire in the\r\nwhite working classes tastes and aspirations which it is impossible for\r\nthem to realize. To meet Asiatic competition squarely, it would be\r\nnecessary to train the white children to be Asiatics. Even the\r\npro-Orientals would hardly advocate this.\"[163]\r\n\r\nThe lines just quoted squarely counter the \"survival of the fittest\" plea\r\nso often made by Asiatic propagandists for colored immigration. The\r\nargument runs that, since the Oriental laborer is able to underbid the\r\nwhite laborer, the Oriental is the \"fittest\" and should therefore be\r\nallowed to supplant the white man in the interests of human progress. This\r\nis of course merely clever use of the well-known fallacy which confuses\r\nthe terms \"fittest\" and \"best.\" The idea that, because a certain human\r\ntype \"fits\" in certain ways a particular environment (often an unhealthy,\r\nman-made social environment), it should be allowed to drive out another\r\ntype endowed with much richer potentialities for the highest forms of\r\nhuman evolution, is a sophistry as absurd as it is dangerous.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ross puts the matter very aptly when he remarks concerning\r\nChinese immigration: \"The competition of white laborer and yellow is not\r\nso simple a test of human worth as some may imagine. Under good conditions\r\nthe white man can best the yellow man in turning off work. But under bad\r\nconditions the yellow man can best the white man, because he can better\r\nendure spoiled food, poor clothing, foul air, noise, heat, dirt,\r\ndiscomfort, and microbes. Reilly can _outdo_ Ah-San, but Ah-San can\r\n_underlive_ Reilly. Ah-San cannot take away Reilly's job as being a better\r\nworkman; but because he can live and do some work at a wage on which\r\nReilly cannot keep himself fit to work at all, three or four Ah-Sans can\r\ntake Reilly's job from him. And they will do it, too, unless they are\r\nbarred out of the market where Reilly is selling his labor. Reilly's\r\nendeavor to exclude Ah-San from his labor market is not the case of a man\r\ndreading to pit himself on equal terms against a better man. Indeed, it is\r\nnot quite so simple and selfish and narrow-minded as all that. It is a\r\ncase of a man fitted to get the most out of good conditions refusing to\r\nyield his place to a weaker man able to withstand bad conditions.\"[164]\r\n\r\nAll this is no disparagement of the Asiatic. He is perfectly justified in\r\ntrying to win broader opportunities in white lands. But we whites are\r\nequally justified in keeping these opportunities for ourselves and our\r\nchildren. The hard facts are that there is not enough for both; that when\r\nthe enormous outward thrust of colored population-pressure bursts into a\r\nwhite land _it cannot let live_, but automatically crushes the white man\r\nout--first the white laborer, then the white merchant, lastly the white\r\naristocrat; until every vestige of white has gone from that land forever.\r\n\r\nThis inexorable process is thus described by an Australian: \"The colored\r\nraces become agencies of economic disturbance and social degradation. They\r\nsap and destroy the upward tendencies of the poorer whites. The latter,\r\ninstead of always having something better to look at and strive after,\r\nhave a lower standard of living, health, and cleanliness set before them,\r\nand the results are disastrous. They sink to the lower level of the\r\nAsiatics, and the degrading tendency proceeds upward by saturation,\r\naffecting several grades of society.... There is an insidious, yet\r\nirresistible, process of social degradation. The colored race does not\r\nintentionally, or even consciously, lower the European; it simply happens\r\nso, by virtue of a natural law which neither race can control. As debased\r\ncoinage will drive out good currency, so a lowered standard of living will\r\ninexorably spread until its effects are universally felt.\"[165]\r\n\r\nIt all comes down to a question of self-preservation. And, despite what\r\nsentimentalists may say, self-preservation _is_ the first law of nature.\r\nTo love one's cultural, idealistic, and racial heritage; to swear to pass\r\nthat heritage unimpaired to one's children; to fight, and, if need be, to\r\ndie in its defense: all this is eternally right and proper, and no amount\r\nof casuistry or sentimentality can alter that unalterable truth. An\r\nEnglishman put the thing in a nutshell when he wrote: \"Asiatic immigration\r\nis not a question of sentiment, but of sheer existence. The whole problem\r\nis summed up in Lafcadio Hearn's pregnant phrase: 'The East can\r\n_underlive_ the West.'\"[166]\r\n\r\nRigorous exclusion of colored immigrants is thus vitally necessary for the\r\nwhite peoples. Unfortunately, this exclusion policy will not be easily\r\nmaintained. Colored population-pressure is insistent and increasing, while\r\nthe matter is still further complicated by the fact that, while no white\r\n_community_ can gain by colored immigration, white\r\n_individuals_--employers of labor--may be great gainers and hence often\r\ntend to put private interest above racial duty. Barring a handful of\r\nsincere but misguided cosmopolitan enthusiasts, it is unscrupulous\r\nbusiness interests which are behind every white proposal to relax the\r\nexclusion laws protecting white areas.\r\n\r\nIn fairness to these business interests, however, let us realize their\r\ngreat temptations. To the average employer, especially in the newer areas\r\nof white settlement where white labor is scarce and dictatorial, what\r\ncould be more enticing than the vision of a boundless supply of cheap and\r\neager colored labor?\r\n\r\nConsider this Californian appraisement of the Chinese coolie: \"The Chinese\r\ncoolie is the ideal industrial machine, the perfect human ox. He will\r\ntransform less food into more work, with less administrative friction,\r\nthan any other creature. Even now, when the scarcity of Chinese labor and\r\nthe consequent rise in wages have eliminated the question of cheapness,\r\nthe Chinese have still the advantage over all other servile labor in\r\nconvenience and efficiency. They are patient, docile, industrious, and\r\nabove all 'honest' in the business sense that they keep their contracts.\r\nAlso, they cost nothing but money. Any other sort of labor costs human\r\neffort and worry, in addition to the money. But Chinese labor can be\r\nbought like any other commodity, at so much a dozen or a hundred. The\r\nChinese contractor delivers the agreed number of men, at the agreed time\r\nand place, for the agreed price, and if any one should drop out he finds\r\nanother in his place. The men board and lodge themselves, and when the\r\nwork is done they disappear from the employer's ken until again needed.\r\nThe entire transaction consists in paying the Chinese contractor an agreed\r\nnumber of dollars for an agreed result. This elimination of the human\r\nelement reduces the labor problem to something the employer can\r\nunderstand. The Chinese labor-machine, from his standpoint, is\r\nperfect.\"[167]\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the Chinese is true to a somewhat lesser extent of all\r\n\"coolie\" labor. Hence, once introduced into a white country, it becomes\r\nimmensely popular--among employers. How it was working out in South\r\nAfrica, before the exclusion acts there, is clearly explained in the\r\nfollowing lines: \"The experience of South Africa is that when once Asiatic\r\nlabor is admitted, the tendency is for it to grow. One manufacturer\r\nsecures it and is able to cut prices to such an extent that the other\r\nmanufacturers are forced either to employ Asiatics also or to reduce white\r\nwages to the Asiatic level. Oriental labor is something which does not\r\nstand still. The taste for it grows. A party springs up financially\r\ninterested in increasing it. In Natal to-day the suggestion that Indian\r\nlabor should no longer be imported is met by an outcry from the planters,\r\nthe farmers, and landowners, and a certain number of manufacturers, that\r\nindustries and agriculture will be ruined. So the coolie ships continue to\r\narrive at Durban, and Natal becomes more and more a land of black and\r\nbrown people and less a land of white people. Instead of becoming a Canada\r\nor New Zealand, it is becoming a Trinidad or Cuba. Instead of white\r\nsettlers, there are brown settlers.... The working-class white population\r\nhas to go, as it is going in Natal. The country becomes a country of white\r\nlandlords and supervisors controlling a horde of Asiatics. It does not\r\nproduce a nation or a free people. It becomes what in the old days of\r\nEnglish colonization was called a 'plantation.'\"[168]\r\n\r\nAll this gives a clearer idea of the difficulties involved in a successful\r\nguarding of the gates. But it also confirms the conviction that the gates\r\nmust be strictly guarded. If anything further were needed to reinforce\r\nthat conviction it should be the present state of those white outposts\r\nwhere the gates have been left ajar.\r\n\r\nHawaii is a good example. This mid-Pacific archipelago was brought under\r\nwhite control by masterful American Nordics, who established Anglo-Saxon\r\ninstitutions and taught the natives the rudiments of Anglo-Saxon\r\ncivilization. The native Hawaiians, like the other Polynesian races, could\r\nnot stand the pressure of white civilization, and withered away. But the\r\nwhite oligarchy which controlled the islands determined to turn their\r\nmarvellous fertility to immediate profit. Labor was imported from the ends\r\nof the earth, the sole test being working ability without regard to race\r\nor color. There followed a great influx of Asiatic labor--at first Chinese\r\nuntil annexation to the United States brought Hawaii under our Chinese\r\nexclusion laws; later on Filipinos, Koreans, and, above all, Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe results are highly instructive. These Asiatics arrived as agricultural\r\nlaborers to work on the plantations. But they did not stay there. Saving\r\ntheir wages, they pushed vigorously into all the middle walks of life. The\r\nHawaiian fisherman and the American artisan or shopkeeper were alike\r\nousted by ruthless undercutting. To-day the American mechanic, the\r\nAmerican storekeeper, the American farmer, even the American contractor,\r\nis a rare bird indeed, while Japanese corporations are buying up the\r\nfinest plantations and growing the finest pineapples and sugar. Fully half\r\nthe population of the islands is Japanese, while the Americans are being\r\nliterally encysted as a small and dwindling aristocracy. In 1917 the\r\nbirths of the two races were: American, 295; Japanese, 5,000! Comment is\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nClear round the globe, the island of Mauritius, the half-way house between\r\nAsia and Africa, tells the same tale. Originally settled by Europeans,\r\nmostly French, Mauritius imported negroes from Africa to work its rich\r\nsoil. This at once made impossible the existence of a white laboring\r\nclass, though the upper, middle, and artisan classes remained unaffected\r\nby the economically backward blacks. A hundred years ago one-third of the\r\npopulation were whites. But after the abolition of slavery the negroes\r\nquit work, and Asiatics were imported to take their place. The upshot was\r\nthat the whites were presently swamped beneath the Asiatic tide--here\r\nmostly Hindus. To-day the Hindus alone form more than two-thirds of the\r\nwhole population, the whites numbering less than one-tenth. Indeed, the\r\nvery outward aspect of the island is changing. The old French landmarks\r\nare going, and the fabled land of \"Paul and Virginia\" is becoming a bit of\r\nHindustan, with a Chinese fringe. Even Port Louis, the capital town, has\r\nmostly passed from white to Indian or Chinese hands.\r\n\r\nNow what do these two world-sundered cases mean? They mean, as an English\r\nwriter justly remarks, \"that under the British flag Mauritius has become\r\nan outpost of Asia, just as Hawaii is another such and under the Stars and\r\nStripes.\"[169] And, of course, there is Natal, already mentioned, which,\r\nat the moment when the recent South African Exclusion Act stayed the\r\nHindu tide, had not only been partially transformed into an Asiatic land,\r\nbut was fast becoming a centre of Asiatic radiation all over South Africa.\r\n\r\nWith such grim warnings before their eyes, it is not strange that the\r\nlusty young Anglo-Saxon communities bordering the Pacific--Australia, New\r\nZealand, British Columbia, and our own \"coast\"--have one and all set their\r\nfaces like flint against the Oriental and have emblazoned across their\r\nportals the legend: \"All White.\" Nothing is more striking than the\r\ninstinctive and instantaneous solidarity which binds together Australians\r\nand Afrikanders, Californians and Canadians, into a \"sacred union\" at the\r\nmere whisper of Asiatic immigration.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the slogan is the same. \"The 'White Australia' idea,\" cries an\r\nantipodean writer, \"is not a political theory. It is a gospel. It counts\r\nfor more than religion; for more than flag, because the flag waves over\r\nall kinds of races; for more than the empire, for the empire is mostly\r\nblack, or brown or yellow; is largely heathen, largely polygamous, partly\r\ncannibal. In fact, the White Australia doctrine is based on the necessity\r\nfor choosing between national existence and national suicide.\"[170] \"White\r\nAustralia!\" writes another Australian in similar vein. \"Australians of all\r\nclasses and political affiliations regard the policy much as Americans\r\nregard the Constitution. It is their most articulate article of faith.\r\nThe reason is not far to seek.... Australian civilization is little more\r\nthan a partial fringe round the continental coastline of 12,210 miles. The\r\ncoast and its hinterlands are settled and developed, although not\r\ncompletely for the entire circumference; in the centre of the country lie\r\nthe apparently illimitable wastes of the Never-Never Land, occupied\r\nentirely by scrub, snakes, sand, and blackfellows. The almost manless\r\nregions of the island-continent are a terrible menace. It is impossible to\r\npolice at all adequately such an enormous area. And the peoples of Asia,\r\nbeating at the bars that confine them, rousing at last from their age-long\r\nslumber, are chafing at the restraints imposed upon their free entry into\r\nand settlement of such uninhabited, undeveloped lands.\"[171]\r\n\r\nSo the Australians, 5,000,000 whites in a far-off continent as large as\r\nthe United States, defy clamoring Asia and swear to keep Australia a white\r\nman's land. Says Professor Pearson: \"We are guarding the last part of the\r\nworld in which the higher races can increase and live freely, for the\r\nhigher civilization. We are denying the yellow race nothing but what it\r\ncan find in the home of its birth, or in countries like the Indian\r\nArchipelago, where the white man can never live except as an exotic.\"[172]\r\n\r\nSo Australia has raised drastic immigration barriers conceived on the\r\nlines laid down by Sir Henry Parkes many years ago: \"It is our duty to\r\npreserve the type of the British nation, and we ought not for any\r\nconsideration whatever to admit any element that would detract from, or in\r\nany appreciable degree lower, that admirable type of nationality. We\r\nshould not encourage or admit amongst us any class of persons whatever\r\nwhom we are not prepared to advance to all our franchises, to all our\r\nprivileges as citizens, and all our social rights, including the right of\r\nmarriage. I maintain that no class of persons should be admitted here who\r\ncannot come amongst us, take up all our rights, perform on a ground of\r\nequality all our duties, and share in our august and lofty work of\r\nfounding a free nation.\"[173]\r\n\r\nFrom Canada rises an equally uncompromising determination. Listen to Mr.\r\nVrooman, a high official of British Columbia: \"Our province is becoming\r\nOrientalized, and one of our most important questions is whether it is to\r\nremain a British province or become an Oriental colony--for we have three\r\nraces demanding seats in our drawing-room, as well as places at our\r\nboard--the Japanese, Chinese, and East Indian.\"[174] And a well-known\r\nCanadian writer, Miss Laut, thus defines the issue: \"If the resident Hindu\r\nhad a vote--and as a British subject, why not?--and if he could break down\r\nthe immigration exclusion act, he could outvote the native-born Canadian\r\nin ten years. In Canada are 5,500,000 native-born, 2,000,000 aliens. In\r\nIndia are hundreds of millions breaking the dikes of their own natural\r\nbarriers and ready to flood any open land. Take down the barriers on the\r\nPacific coast, and there would be 10,000,000 Hindus in Canada in ten\r\nyears.\"[175]\r\n\r\nOur Pacific coast takes precisely the same attitude. Says Chester H.\r\nRowell, a California writer: \"There is no right way to solve a race\r\nproblem except to stop it before it begins.... The Pacific coast is the\r\nfrontier of the white man's world, the culmination of the westward\r\nmigration which is the white man's whole history. It will remain the\r\nfrontier so long as we regard it as such; no longer. Unless it is\r\nmaintained there, there is no other line at which it can be maintained\r\nwithout more effort than American government and American civilization are\r\nable to sustain. The multitudes of Asia are awake, after their long sleep,\r\nas the multitudes of Europe were when our present flood of immigration\r\nbegan. We know what could happen, on the Asiatic side, by what did happen\r\nand is happening on the European side. On that side we have survived....\r\nBut against Asiatic immigration we could not survive. The numbers who\r\nwould come would be greater than we could encyst, and the races who would\r\ncome are those which we could never absorb. The permanence not merely of\r\nAmerican civilization, but of the white race on this continent, depends on\r\nour not doing on the Pacific side what we have done on the Atlantic\r\ncoast.\"[176]\r\n\r\nSays another Californian, Justice Burnett: \"The Pacific States comprise an\r\nempire of vast potentialities and capable of supporting a population of\r\nmany millions. Those now living there propose that it shall continue to be\r\na home for them and their children, and that they shall not be overwhelmed\r\nand driven eastward by an ever-increasing yellow and brown flood.\"[177]\r\n\r\nAll \"economic\" arguments are summarily put aside. \"They say,\" writes\r\nanother Californian, \"that our fruit-orchards, mines, and seed-farms\r\ncannot be worked without them (Oriental laborers). It were better that\r\nthey never be developed than that our white laborers be degraded and\r\ndriven from the soil. The same arguments were used a century and more ago\r\nto justify the importation of African labor.... As it is now, no\r\nself-respecting white laborer will work beside the Mongolian upon any\r\nterms. The proposition, whether we shall have white or yellow labor on the\r\nPacific coast, must soon be settled, for we cannot have both. If the\r\nMongolian is permitted to occupy the land, the white laborer from east of\r\nthe Rockies will not come here--he will shun California as he would a\r\npestilence. And who can blame him?\"[178]\r\n\r\nThe middle as well as the working class is imperilled by any large number\r\nof Orientals, for \"The presence of the Japanese trader means that the\r\nwhite man must either go out of business or abandon his standard of\r\ncomfort and sink to the level of the Asiatic, who will sleep under his\r\ncounter and subsist upon food that would mean starvation to his white\r\nrival.\"[179]\r\n\r\nIndeed, Californian assertions that Oriental immigration menaces, not\r\nmerely the coast, but the whole continent, seem well taken. This view was\r\nofficially indorsed by Mr. Caminetti, Commissioner-General of Immigration,\r\nwho testified before a Congressional committee some years ago: \"Asiatic\r\nimmigration is a menace to the whole country, and particularly to the\r\nPacific coast. The danger is general. No part of the United States is\r\nimmune. The Chinese are now spread over the entire country, and the\r\nJapanese want to encroach. The Chinese have become so acclimated that they\r\ncan prosper in any part of our country.... I would have a law to register\r\nthe Asiatic laborers who come into the country. It is impossible to\r\nprotect ourselves from persons who come in surreptitiously.\"[180]\r\n\r\nFortunately, the majority of thinking Americans are to-day convinced that\r\nOriental immigration must not be tolerated. Most of our leading men have\r\nso expressed themselves. For example, Woodrow Wilson, during his first\r\npresidential campaign, declared on May 3, 1912: \"In the matter of Chinese\r\nand Japanese coolie immigration, I stand for the national policy of\r\nexclusion. The whole question is one of assimilation of diverse races. We\r\ncannot make a homogeneous population of a people who do not blend with the\r\nCaucasian race. Their lower standard of living as laborers will crowd out\r\nthe white agriculturist and is in other fields a most serious industrial\r\nmenace. The success of free democratic institutions demands of our people\r\neducation, intelligence, and patriotism, and the State should protect them\r\nagainst unjust and impossible competition. Remunerative labor is the basis\r\nof contentment. Democracy rests on the equality of the citizen. Oriental\r\ncoolieism will give us another race-problem to solve and surely we have\r\nhad our lesson.\"[181]\r\n\r\nThe necessity for rigid Oriental exclusion is nowhere better exemplified\r\nthan by the alarm felt to-day in California by the extraordinarily high\r\nbirth-rate of its Japanese residents. There are probably not over 150,000\r\nJapanese in the whole United States, their numbers being kept down by the\r\n\"Gentlemen's Agreement\" entered into by the Japanese and American\r\nGovernments. But, few though they are, they bring in their women--and\r\nthese women bring many children into the world. The California Japanese\r\nsettle in compact agricultural colonies, which so teem with babies that a\r\nleading California organ, the Los Angeles _Times_, thus seriously\r\ndiscusses the matter:\r\n\r\n\"There may have been a time when an anti-Japanese land bill would have\r\nlimited Japanese immigration. But such a law would be impotent now to keep\r\nnative Japanese from possessing themselves of the choicest agricultural\r\nand horticultural land in California. For there are now more than 30,000\r\nchildren in the State of Japanese parentage, native-born; they possess all\r\nthe rights of leasing and ownership held by white children born here....\r\nThe birth statistics seem to prove that the danger is not from the\r\nJapanese soldiers, but from the picture brides. The fruitfulness of those\r\nbrides is almost uncanny.... Here is a Japanese problem of sufficient\r\ngravity to merit serious consideration. We are threatened with an\r\nover-production of Japanese children. First come the men, then the picture\r\nbrides, then the families. If California is to be preserved for the next\r\ngeneration as a 'white man's country' there must be some movement started\r\nthat will restrict the Japanese birth-rate in California. When a condition\r\nis reached in which two children of Japanese parentage are born in some\r\ndistricts for every white child, it is about time something else was done\r\nthan making speeches about it in the American Senate.... If the same\r\npresent birth-ratio were maintained for the next ten years, there would be\r\n150,000 children of Japanese descent born in California in 1929 and but\r\n40,000 white children. And in 1949 the majority of the population of\r\nCalifornia would be Japanese, ruling the State.\"[182]\r\n\r\nThe alarm of our California contemporary may, in this particular instance,\r\nbe exaggerated. Nevertheless, when we remember the practically unlimited\r\nexpansive possibilities of even small human groups under favorable\r\nconditions, the picture drawn contains no features inherently impossible\r\nof realization. What is absolutely certain is that any wholesale Oriental\r\ninflux would inevitably doom the whites, first of the Pacific coast, and\r\nlater of the whole United States, to social sterilization and ultimate\r\nracial extinction.\r\n\r\nThus all those newer regions of the white world won by the white expansion\r\nof the last four centuries are alike menaced by the colored migration\r\nperil; whether these regions be under-developed, under-populated frontier\r\nmarches like Australia and British Columbia, or older and better-populated\r\ncountries like the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd let not Europe, the white brood-land, the heart of the white world,\r\nthink itself immune. In the last analysis, the self-same peril menaces it\r\ntoo. This has long been recognized by far-sighted men. For many years\r\neconomists and sociologists have discussed the possibility of Asiatic\r\nimmigration into Europe. Low as wages and living standards are in many\r\nEuropean countries, they are yet far higher than in the congested East,\r\nwhile the rapid progress of social betterment throughout Europe must\r\nfurther widen the gap and make the white continent seem a more and more\r\ndesirable haven for the swarming, black-haired bread-seekers of China,\r\nIndia, and Japan.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a few observers of modern conditions have come to the conclusion\r\nthat this invasion of Europe by Asiatic labor is unescapable, and they\r\nhave drawn the most pessimistic conclusions. For example, more than a\r\ndecade ago an English writer asserted gloomily: \"No level-headed thinker\r\ncan imagine that it will always be possible to prevent the free migration\r\nof intelligent races, representing in the aggregate half the peoples of\r\nthe world, should those peoples actively conceive that their welfare\r\ndemands that they should seek employment in Europe. In these days of rapid\r\ntransit, of aviation, such a measure of repression is impossible.... We\r\nshall not be destroyed, perhaps, by the sudden onrush of invaders, as Rome\r\nwas overwhelmed by the northern hordes; we shall be gradually subdued and\r\nabsorbed by the 'peaceful penetration' of more virile races.\"[183]\r\n\r\nNow, mark you! All that I have thus far written concerning colored\r\nimmigration has been written without reference to the late war. In other\r\nwords, the colored-migration peril would have been just as grave as I have\r\ndescribed it even if the white world were still as strong as in the years\r\nbefore 1914.\r\n\r\nBut the war has of course immensely aggravated an already critical\r\nsituation. The war has shaken both the material and psychological bases of\r\nwhite resistance to colored infiltration, while it has correspondingly\r\nstrengthened Asiatic hopes and hardened Asiatic determination to break\r\ndown the barriers debarring colored men from white lands.\r\n\r\nAsia's perception of what the war signified in this respect was\r\ninstantaneous. The war was not a month old before Japanese journals were\r\nsuggesting a relaxation of Asiatic exclusion laws in the British colonies\r\nas a natural corollary to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and Anglo-Japanese\r\ncomradeship in arms. Said the Tokio _Mainichi Deupo_ in August, 1914: \"We\r\nare convinced that it is a matter of the utmost importance that Britons\r\nbeyond the seas should make a better attempt at fraternizing with Japan,\r\nas better relations between the English-speaking races and Japan will have\r\na vital bearing on the destiny of the empire. There is no reason why the\r\nBritish colonies fronting on the Pacific should not actively participate\r\nin the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Britain needs population for her surplus\r\nland and Japan needs land for her surplus population. This fact alone\r\nshould draw the two races closer together. Moreover, the British people\r\nhave ample capital but deficiency of labor, while it is the reverse with\r\nJapan.... The harmonious co-operation of Britain and her colonies with\r\nJapan insures safety to British and Japanese interests alike. Without such\r\nco-operation, Japan and Great Britain are both unsafe.\"[184]\r\n\r\nWhat this \"co-operation\" implies was very frankly stated by _The Japan\r\nMagazine_ at about the same date: \"There is nothing that would do so much\r\nto bind East and West firmly together as the opening of the British\r\ncolonies to Japanese immigration. Then, indeed, Britain would be a lion\r\nendowed with wings. Large numbers of Japanese in the British colonies\r\nwould mean that Britain would have the assistance of Japan in the\r\nprotection of her colonies. But if an anti-Japanese agitation is\r\npermitted, both countries will be making the worst instead of the best of\r\nthe Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Thus it would be allowed to make Japan an\r\nenemy instead of a friend. It seems that the British people both at home\r\nand in the colonies are not yet alive to the importance of the policy\r\nsuggested, and it is, therefore, pointed out and emphasized before it is\r\ntoo late.\"[185]\r\n\r\nThe covert threat embodied in those last lines was a forerunner of the\r\nstorm of anti-white abuse which rose from the more bellicose sections of\r\nthe Japanese press as soon as it became evident that neither the British\r\nDominions nor the United States were going to relax their immigration\r\nlaws. Some of this anti-white comment, directed particularly against the\r\nAnglo-Saxon peoples, I have already noted in the second chapter of this\r\nbook, but such comment as bears directly on immigration matters I have\r\nreserved for discussion at this point.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Tokio _Yorodzu_ wrote early in 1916: \"Japan has been most\r\nfaithful to the requirements of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and yet the\r\ntreatment meted out to our countrymen in Canada, Australia, and other\r\nBritish colonies has been a glaring insult to us.\"[186] A year later a\r\nwriter in _The Japan Magazine_ declared: \"The agitation against Japanese\r\nin foreign countries must cease, even if Japan has to take up arms to stop\r\nit. She should not allow her immigration to be treated as a\r\nrace-question.\"[187] And in 1919 the _Yorodzu_ thus paid its respects to\r\nthe exclusionist activity of our Pacific coast States: \"Whatever may be\r\ntheir object, their actions are more despicable than those of the Germans\r\nwhose barbarities they attacked as worthy of Huns. At least, these\r\nAmericans are barbarians who are on a lower plane of civilization than the\r\nJapanese.\"[188]\r\n\r\nThe war produced no letting down of immigration barriers along the white\r\nworld's exposed frontiers, where men are fully alive to the peril. But the\r\nwar did produce temporary waverings of sentiment in the United States,\r\nwhile in Europe colored labor was imported wholesale in ways which may\r\nhave ominous consequences.\r\n\r\nOur own acute labor shortage during the war, particularly in agriculture,\r\nled many Americans, especially employers, to cast longing eyes at the\r\ntempting reservoirs of Asia. Typical of this attitude is an article by\r\nHudson Maxim in the spring of 1918. Mr. Maxim urged the importation of a\r\nmillion Chinese to solve our farming and domestic-service problems.\r\n\r\n\"If it is possible,\" he wrote, \"by the employment of Chinese methods of\r\nintensive farming, to increase the production of our lands to such an\r\nextent, how stupendous would be the benefit of wide introduction of such\r\nmethods. The exhausted lands of New England could be made to produce like\r\na tropical garden. The vast areas of the great West that are to-day not\r\nproducing 10 per cent of what they ought to produce could be made to\r\nproduce the other 90 per cent by the introduction of Chinese labor.... The\r\naverage American does not like farming. The sons of the prosperous farmers\r\ndo not take kindly to the tilling of the soil with their own hands. They\r\nprefer the excitement and the diversions and stimulus of the life of city\r\nand town, and they leave the farm for the office and factory....\r\n\r\n\"Chinese, imported as agricultural laborers and household servants, would\r\nsolve the agricultural labor problem and the servant problem, and we\r\nshould have the best agricultural workers in the world and the best\r\nhousehold servants in the world, in unlimited numbers.\"[189]\r\n\r\nNow I submit that such arguments, however well-intentioned, are nothing\r\nshort of race-treason. If there be one truth which history has proved, it\r\nis the solemn truth that those who _work_ the land will ultimately _own_\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the countryside is the seed-bed from which the city\r\npopulations are normally recruited. The one bright spot in our otherwise\r\ndubious ethnic future is the fact that most of our unassimilable aliens\r\nhave stopped in the towns, while many of the most assimilable immigrants\r\nhave settled in the country, thus reinforcing rather than replacing our\r\nnative American rural population. Any suggestion which advocates the\r\nsettlement of our countryside by Asiatics and the deliberate driving of\r\nour native stocks to the towns, there to be sterilized and eliminated, is\r\nsimply unspeakable.\r\n\r\nFortunately, such fatal counsels were with us never acted upon, albeit\r\nthey should be remembered as lurking perils which will probably be urged\r\nagain in future times of stress. But during Europe's war-agony, yellow,\r\nbrown, and black men were imported wholesale, not only for the armies, but\r\nalso for the factories and fields. These colored aliens have mostly been\r\nshipped back to their homes. Nevertheless, they have carried with them\r\nvivid recollections of the marvellous West, and the tale will spread to\r\nthe remotest corners of the colored world, stirring hard-pressed colored\r\nbread-seekers to distant ventures. Furthermore, Europe has had a practical\r\ndemonstration of the colored alien's manifold usefulness, and if Europe's\r\ntroubles are prolonged, the colored man may be increasingly employed there\r\nboth in peace and war.\r\n\r\nEven during the war the French and English working classes felt the\r\npressure of colored competition. Race-feeling grew strained, and presently\r\nboth England and France witnessed the (to them) unwonted spectacles of\r\nrace-riots in their port-towns where the colored aliens were most thickly\r\ngathered. An American observer thus describes the \"breaking of the\r\nexclusion walls erected against the Chinese\":\r\n\r\n\"In London, one Wednesday evening, twenty-four months ago (_i. e._, in\r\n1916), there was a mass-meeting held on the corner of Piggot Street,\r\nLimehouse, to protest against the influx of John Chinaman into bonny old\r\nEngland.... The London navvies that night heard a protest against 'the\r\nChinese invasion' of Britain. They knew that down on the London docks\r\nthere were two Chinamen to every white man since the coming of war. They\r\nknew that many of these yellow aliens were married. They knew, too, that a\r\nbig Chinese restaurant had just opened down the West India Dock Road.\r\n\r\n\"The Sailors' and Firemen's Union--one of the most powerful in\r\nEngland--carried the protest into the Trades-Union Congress held at\r\nBirmingham. There, alarm was voiced at the steady increase in the number\r\nof Chinese hands on Britain's ships. It was an increase, true, since the\r\nstress of war-times had begun to try Britain. But what England's sons of\r\nthe seven seas wanted to know was: when is 'this Orientalizing' of the\r\nBritish marine to stop?... The seamen's unions were willing to do their\r\nbit for John Bull, but they wondered what was going to happen after the\r\ncoming of peace. Would the Chinese continue to man John Bull's ships?...\r\n\r\n\"Such is one manifestation of the decisive lifting of gates and barriers\r\nthat has taken place since the white world went to war. To-day the\r\nChinese--for decades finding a wall in every white man's country--are\r\nnumbered by the tens of thousands in the service of the Allies. They have\r\nmade good. They are a war-factor.... All told, 200,000 Chinese are\r\n'carrying on' in the war-zone, laboring behind the lines, in\r\nmunition-works and factories, manning ships....\r\n\r\n\"What will happen when peace comes upon this red world--a world turned\r\ntopsyturvy by the white man's Great War, which has taken John Chinaman\r\nfrom Shantung, Chihli, and Kwangtung to that battle-ground in France?...\r\nThat makes the drafting of China's man-power one of the most supremely\r\nimportant events in the Great War. The family of nations is taking on a\r\nnew meaning--John Chinaman overseas has a place in it. As Italian\r\nharvest-labor before the war went to and from Argentina for a few months'\r\nwork, so the Chinese have gone to Europe under contract and go home again.\r\nPerhaps this action will have a bearing on the solution of the Far West's\r\nagricultural labor problem.\r\n\r\n\"Do not believe for a moment that the armies of Chinese in Europe will\r\nforget the lessons taught them in the West. When these sons of Han come\r\nhome, the Great War will be found to have given birth to a new East.\"[190]\r\n\r\nSo ends our survey. It has girdled the globe. And the lesson is always the\r\nsame: Colored migration is a _universal_ peril, menacing every part of the\r\nwhite world. Nowhere can the white man endure colored competition;\r\neverywhere \"the East can _underlive_ the West.\" The grim truth of the\r\nmatter is this: The whole white race is exposed, immediately or\r\nultimately, to the possibility of social sterilization and final\r\nreplacement or absorption by the teeming colored races.\r\n\r\nWhat this unspeakable catastrophe would mean for the future of the planet,\r\nand how the peril may be averted, will form the subject of my concluding\r\npages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS OF THE AGES\r\n\r\n\r\nOurs is a solemn moment. We stand at a crisis--the supreme crisis of the\r\nages. For unnumbered millenniums man has toiled upward from the dank\r\njungles of savagery toward glorious heights which his mental and spiritual\r\npotentialities give promise that he shall attain. His path has been slow\r\nand wavering. Time and again he has lost his way and plunged into deep\r\nvalleys. Man's trail is littered with the wrecks of dead civilizations and\r\ndotted with the graves of promising peoples stricken by an untimely end.\r\n\r\nHumanity has thus suffered many a disaster. Yet none of these disasters\r\nwere fatal, because they were merely local. Those wrecked civilizations\r\nand blighted peoples were only parts of a larger whole. Always some strong\r\nbarbarians, endowed with rich, unspoiled heredities, caught the falling\r\ntorch and bore it onward flaming high once more.\r\n\r\nOut of the prehistoric shadows the white races pressed to the front and\r\nproved in a myriad ways their fitness for the hegemony of mankind.\r\nGradually they forged a common civilization; then, when vouchsafed their\r\nunique opportunity of oceanic mastery four centuries ago, they spread over\r\nthe earth, filling its empty spaces with their superior breeds and\r\nassuring to themselves an unparalleled paramountcy of numbers and\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\nThree centuries later the whites took a fresh leap forward. The nineteenth\r\ncentury was a new age of discovery--this time into the realms of science.\r\nThe hidden powers of nature were unveiled, incalculable energies were\r\ntamed to human use, terrestrial distance was abridged, and at last the\r\nplanet was integrated under the hegemony of a single race with a common\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe prospects were magnificent, the potentialities of progress apparently\r\nunlimited. Yet there were commensurate perils. Towering heights mean\r\nabysmal depths, while the very possibility of supreme success implies the\r\npossibility of supreme failure. All these marvellous achievements were due\r\nsolely to superior heredity, and the mere maintenance of what had been won\r\ndepended absolutely upon the prior maintenance of race-values.\r\nCivilization of itself means nothing. It is merely an effect, whose cause\r\nis the creative urge of superior germ-plasm. Civilization is the body; the\r\nrace is the soul. Let the soul vanish, and the body moulders into the\r\ninanimate dust from which it came.\r\n\r\nTwo things are necessary for the continued existence of a race: it must\r\nremain itself, and it must breed its best. Every race is the result of\r\nages of development which evolves specialized capacities that make the\r\nrace what it is and render it capable of creative achievement. These\r\nspecialized capacities (which particularly mark the superior races),\r\nbeing relatively recent developments, are highly unstable. They are what\r\nbiologists call \"recessive\" characters; that is, they are not nearly so\r\n\"dominant\" as the older, generalized characters which races inherit from\r\nremote ages and which have therefore been more firmly stamped upon the\r\ngerm-plasm. Hence, when a highly specialized stock interbreeds with a\r\ndifferent stock, the newer, less stable, specialized characters are bred\r\nout, the variation, no matter how great its potential value to human\r\nevolution, being _irretrievably lost_. This occurs even in the mating of\r\ntwo superior stocks if these stocks are widely dissimilar in character.\r\nThe valuable specializations of both breeds cancel out, and the mixed\r\noffspring tend strongly to revert to generalized mediocrity.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, the more primitive a type is, the more prepotent it is.\r\nThis is why crossings with the negro are uniformly fatal. Whites,\r\nAmerindians, or Asiatics--all are alike vanquished by the invincible\r\nprepotency of the more primitive, generalized, and lower negro blood.\r\n\r\nThere is no immediate danger of the world being swamped by black blood.\r\nBut there is a very imminent danger that the white stocks may be swamped\r\nby Asiatic blood.\r\n\r\nThe white man's very triumphs have evoked this danger. His virtual\r\nabolition of distance has destroyed the protection which nature once\r\nconferred. Formerly mankind dwelt in such dispersed isolation that\r\nwholesale contact of distant, diverse stocks was practically impossible.\r\nBut with the development of cheap and rapid transportation, nature's\r\nbarriers are down. Unless man erects and maintains artificial barriers the\r\nvarious races will increasingly mingle, and the inevitable result will be\r\nthe supplanting or absorption of the higher by the lower types.\r\n\r\nWe can see this process working out in almost every phase of modern\r\nmigration. The white immigration into Latin America is the exception which\r\nproves the rule. That particular migration is, of course, beneficent,\r\nsince it means the influx of relatively high types into undeveloped lands,\r\nsparsely populated by types either no higher or much lower than the new\r\narrivals. But almost everywhere else, whether we consider interwhite\r\nmigrations or colored encroachments on white lands, the net result is an\r\nexpansion of lower and a contraction of higher stocks, the process being\r\nthus a disgenic one. Even in Asia the evils of modern migration are\r\nbeginning to show. The Japanese Government has been obliged to prohibit\r\nthe influx of Chinese and Korean coolies who were undercutting Japanese\r\nlabor and thus undermining the economic bases of Japanese life.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, modern migration is itself only one aspect of a still more\r\nfundamental disgenic trend. The whole course of modern urban and\r\nindustrial life is disgenic. Over and above immigration, the tendency is\r\ntoward a replacement of the more valuable by the less valuable elements of\r\nthe population. All over the civilized world racial values are\r\ndiminishing, and the logical end of this disgenic process is racial\r\nbankruptcy and the collapse of civilization.\r\n\r\nNow why is all this? It is primarily because we have not yet adjusted\r\nourselves to the radically new environment into which our epochal\r\nscientific discoveries led us a century ago. Such adaptation as we have\r\neffected has been almost wholly on the material side. The no less sweeping\r\nidealistic adaptations which the situation calls for have not been made.\r\nHence, modern civilization has been one-sided, abnormal, unhealthy--and\r\nnature is exacting penalties which will increase in severity until we\r\neither fully adapt or _finally perish_.\r\n\r\n\"Finally perish!\" That is the exact alternative which confronts the white\r\nrace. For white civilization is to-day conterminous with the white race.\r\nThe civilizations of the past were local. They were confined to a\r\nparticular people or group of peoples. If they failed, there were always\r\nsome unspoiled, well-endowed barbarians to step forward and \"carry on.\"\r\nBut to-day _there are no more white barbarians_. The earth has grown\r\nsmall, and men are everywhere in close touch. If white civilization goes\r\ndown, the white race is irretrievably ruined. It will be swamped by the\r\ntriumphant colored races, who will obliterate the white man by elimination\r\nor absorption. What has taken place in Central Asia, once a white and now\r\na brown or yellow land, will take place in Australasia, Europe, and\r\nAmerica. Not to-day, nor yet to-morrow; perhaps not for generations; but\r\nsurely in the end. If the present drift be not changed, we whites are all\r\nultimately doomed. Unless we set our house in order, the doom will sooner\r\nor later overtake us all.\r\n\r\nAnd that would mean that the race obviously endowed with the greatest\r\ncreative ability, the race which had achieved most in the past and which\r\ngave the richer promise for the future, had passed away, carrying with it\r\nto the grave those potencies upon which the realization of man's highest\r\nhopes depends. A million years of human evolution might go uncrowned, and\r\nearth's supreme life-product, man, might never fulfil his potential\r\ndestiny. This is why we to-day face \"The Crisis of the Ages.\"\r\n\r\nTo many minds the mere possibility of such a catastrophe may seem\r\nunthinkable. Yet a dispassionate survey of the past shows that it is not\r\nonly possible but probable if present conditions go on unchanged. The\r\nwhole history of life, both human and subhuman, teaches us that nature\r\nwill not condone disobedience; that, as I have already phrased it, \"no\r\nliving being stands above her law, and protozoon or demigod, if they\r\ntransgress, alike must die.\"\r\n\r\nNow we have transgressed; grievously transgressed--and we are suffering\r\ngrievous penalties. But pain is really kind. Pain is the importunate\r\ntocsin which rouses to dangerous realities and spurs to the seeking of a\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact we are confusedly aware of our evil plight, and legion\r\nare the remedies to-day proposed. Some of these are mere quack nostrums.\r\nOthers contain valuable remedial properties. To be sure, there is probably\r\nno _one_ curative agent, since our troubles are complex and magic elixirs\r\nheal only in the realm of dreams. But one element should be fundamental to\r\nall the compoundings of the social pharmacopoeia. That element is\r\n_blood_.\r\n\r\nIt is clean, virile, genius-bearing blood, streaming down the ages through\r\nthe unerring action of heredity, which, in anything like a favorable\r\nenvironment, will multiply itself, solve our problems, and sweep us on to\r\nhigher and nobler destinies. What we to-day need above all else is a\r\nchanged attitude of mind--a recognition of the supreme importance of\r\nheredity, not merely in scientific treatises but in the practical ordering\r\nof the world's affairs. We are where we are to-day primarily because we\r\nhave neglected this vital principle; because we have concerned ourselves\r\nwith dead things instead of with living beings.\r\n\r\nThis disregard of heredity is perhaps not strange. It is barely a\r\ngeneration since its fundamental importance was scientifically\r\nestablished, and the world's conversion to even the most vital truth takes\r\ntime. In fact, we also have much to unlearn. A little while ago we were\r\ntaught that all men were equal and that good conditions could, of\r\nthemselves, quickly perfect mankind. The seductive charm of these\r\ndangerous fallacies lingers and makes us loath to put them resolutely\r\naside.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we now know the truth. At last we have been vouchsafed clear\r\ninsight into the laws of life. We now know that men are not, and never\r\nwill be, equal. We know that environment and education can develop only\r\nwhat heredity brings. We know that the acquirements of individuals are\r\neither not inherited at all or are inherited in so slight a degree as to\r\nmake no perceptible difference from generation to generation. In other\r\nwords: we now know that heredity is paramount in human evolution, all\r\nother things being secondary factors.\r\n\r\nThis basic truth is already accepted by large numbers of thinking men and\r\nwomen all over the civilized world, and if it becomes firmly fixed in the\r\npopular consciousness it will work nothing short of a revolution in the\r\nordering of the world's affairs.\r\n\r\nFor race-betterment is such an intensely _practical_ matter! When peoples\r\ncome to realize that the _quality_ of the population is the source of all\r\ntheir prosperity, progress, security, and even existence; when they\r\nrealize that a single genius may be worth more in actual dollars than a\r\ndozen gold-mines, while, conversely, racial decline spells material\r\nimpoverishment and decay; when such things are really believed, we shall\r\nsee much-abused \"eugenics\" actually moulding social programmes and\r\npolitical policies. Were the white world to-day really convinced of the\r\nsupreme importance of race-values, how long would it take to stop debasing\r\nimmigration, reform social abuses that are killing out the fittest\r\nstrains, and put an end to the feuds which have just sent us through hell\r\nand threaten to send us promptly back again?\r\n\r\nWell, perhaps our change of heart may come sooner than now appears. The\r\nhorrors of the war, the disappointment of the peace, the terror of\r\nBolshevism, and the rising tide of color have knocked a good deal of the\r\nnonsense out of us, and have given multitudes a hunger for realities who\r\nwere before content with a diet of phrases. Said wise old Benjamin\r\nFranklin: \"Dame Experience sets a dear school, but fools will have no\r\nother.\" Our course at the dame's school is already well under way and\r\npromises to be exceeding dear.\r\n\r\nOnly, it is to be hoped our education will be rapid, for time presses and\r\nthe hour is grave. If certain lessons are not learned and acted upon\r\nshortly, we may be overwhelmed by irreparable disasters and all our dear\r\nschooling will go for naught.\r\n\r\nWhat are the things we _must_ do promptly if we would avert the worst?\r\nThis \"irreducible minimum\" runs about as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the wretched Versailles business will have to be\r\nthoroughly revised. As it stands, dragon's teeth have been sown over both\r\nEurope and Asia, and unless they be plucked up they will presently grow a\r\ncrop of cataclysms which will seal the white world's doom.\r\n\r\nSecondly, some sort of provisional understanding must be arrived at\r\nbetween the white world and renascent Asia. We whites will have to\r\nabandon our tacit assumption of permanent domination over Asia, while\r\nAsiatics will have to forego their dreams of migration to white lands and\r\npenetration of Africa and Latin America. Unless some such understanding is\r\narrived at, the world will drift into a gigantic race-war--and genuine\r\nrace-war means war to the knife. Such a hideous catastrophe should be\r\nabhorrent to both sides. Nevertheless, Asia should be given clearly to\r\nunderstand that we cannot permit either migration to white lands or\r\npenetration of the non-Asiatic tropics, and that for these matters we\r\nprefer to fight to a finish rather than yield to a finish--because our\r\n\"finish\" is precisely what surrender on these points would mean.\r\n\r\nThirdly, even within the white world, migrations of lower human types like\r\nthose which have worked such havoc in the United States must be rigorously\r\ncurtailed. Such migrations upset standards, sterilize better stocks,\r\nincrease low types, and compromise national futures more than war,\r\nrevolutions, or native deterioration.\r\n\r\nSuch are the things which simply _must_ be done if we are to get through\r\nthe next few decades without convulsions which may render impossible the\r\nwhite world's recovery.\r\n\r\nThese things will not bring in the millennium. Far from it. Our ills are\r\nso deep-seated that in nearly every civilized country racial values would\r\ncontinue to depreciate even if all three were carried into effect. But\r\nthey will at least give our wounds a chance to heal, and they will give\r\nthe new biological revelation time to permeate the popular consciousness\r\nand transfuse with a new idealism our materialistic age. As the years\r\npass, the supreme importance of heredity and the supreme value of superior\r\nstocks will sink into our being, and we will acquire a true\r\n_race_-consciousness (as opposed to national or cultural consciousness)\r\nwhich will bridge political gulfs, remedy social abuses, and exorcise the\r\nlurking spectre of miscegenation.\r\n\r\nIn those better days, we or the next generation will take in hand the\r\nproblem of race-depreciation, and segregation of defectives and abolition\r\nof handicaps penalizing the better stocks will put an end to our present\r\nracial decline. By that time biological knowledge will have so increased\r\nand the popular philosophy of life will have been so idealized that it\r\nwill be possible to inaugurate positive measures of race-betterment which\r\nwill unquestionably yield the most wonderful results.\r\n\r\nThose splendid tasks are probably not ours. They are for our successors in\r\na happier age. But we have our task, and God knows it is a hard one--the\r\nsalvage of a shipwrecked world! Ours it is to make possible that happier\r\nage, whose full-fruits we shall never see.\r\n\r\nWell, what of it? Does not the new idealism teach us that we are links in\r\na vital chain, charged with high duties both to the dead and the unborn?\r\nIn very truth we are at once sons of sires who sleep in calm assurance\r\nthat we will not betray the trust they confided to our hands, and sires\r\nof sons who in the Beyond wait confident that we shall not cheat them of\r\ntheir birthright.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, act in the spirit of Kipling's immortal lines:\r\n\r\n  \"Our Fathers in a wondrous age,\r\n  Ere yet the Earth was small,\r\n  Ensured to us an heritage,\r\n  And doubted not at all\r\n  That we, the children of their heart,\r\n  Which then did beat so high,\r\n  In later time should play like part\r\n  For our posterity.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Then, fretful, murmur not they gave\r\n  So great a charge to keep,\r\n  Nor dream that awestruck Time shall save\r\n  Their labor while we sleep.\r\n  Dear-bought and clear, a thousand year\r\n  Our fathers' title runs.\r\n  Make we likewise their sacrifice,\r\n  Defrauding not our sons.\"[191]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abd-el-Wahab, 58\r\n\r\n  Abyssinia, 4, 89\r\n\r\n  Afghanistan, independence

Despite the handicap of yellow fever, the\r\nFrench were on the point of stamping out the negro insurgents when the\r\nrenewal of war with England, in 1803, cut off the French\r\nsea-communications. The story of Haiti offers many interesting and\r\ninstructive points to the student of race-questions. It was the first real\r\nshock between the ideals of white supremacy and race-equality; a prologue\r\nto the mighty drama of our own day. It also shows what real race-war\r\nmeans. To the historical student I cite my \"French Revolution in San\r\nDomingo\" (Boston, 1914), wherein the entire revolutionary cycle between\r\n1789 and 1804 is described, based largely upon hitherto unexploited\r\narchival material.\r\n\r\n[137] H.
