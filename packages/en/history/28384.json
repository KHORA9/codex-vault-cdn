The idea of their publication\r\nwas highly distasteful to me until the often repeated importunities of\r\nmany of those whose judgment commands my respect persuaded me that some\r\nof the facts and incidents I have recalled would prove of interest to a\r\nlarge circle of readers. The narrative is concerned with persons and\r\nevents that have interested me during the busy hours of a lengthy life.\r\nI have been deeply impressed by the changes wrought by time in the modes\r\nof education, which are now so much at variance with those of my\r\nchildhood, and in the manners and customs of those with whom I have\r\nmingled.\r\n\r\nI should be guilty of an act of grave injustice if I failed to express\r\nmy grateful acknowledgments for the aid so unselfishly rendered, in a\r\nscore of ways, by my daughter, Mrs. Roswell Randall Hoes, without which\r\nthese pages would not, and could not, have been written.\r\n\r\nM.

My home was in Queens County, on\r\nthe old Rockaway Road, and often in childhood during storms at sea I\r\nhave heard the waves dash upon the Rockaway beach. Two miles the other\r\nside of us was the village of Jamaica, and from our windows we caught\r\nglimpses of the bay that bore its name. My first home was a large\r\nold-fashioned house on a farm of many acres, ornamented by Lombardy\r\npoplars which stood on each side of the driveway, a fashion introduced\r\ninto this country by Lafayette. My maternal grandfather, Captain John\r\nHazard, who had commanded a privateersman during the Revolution,\r\npurchased the place from \"Citizen\" Edmond Charles Genet, the first\r\nMinister of France to the United States, and I have the old parchment\r\ndeed of transfer still in my possession. During the War of the\r\nRevolution my Grandfather Hazard's ship was captured by Admiral George\r\nB. Rodney, and I have often heard my mother tell the story she received\r\nfrom his lips, to the effect that after he was \"comfortably housed in\r\nirons\" on Rodney's ship he overheard a conversation in which his name\r\nwas frequently mentioned. The subject under discussion was the form of\r\npunishment he deserved, and the cheerful remark reached his ear: \"Hang\r\nthe damned rebel.\" This incident made an indelible impression upon my\r\nmother's memory, which was emphasized by the fact that her father bore\r\nthe scars of those irons to the day of his death.\r\n\r\nI have no recollection of my Grandfather Hazard, as he died soon after\r\nmy birth. Jonathan Hazard, his brother, espoused the English cause\r\nduring the Revolution. This was possibly due to the influences of an\r\nEnglish mother, whose maiden name was Sarah Owen, of Shropshire. I have\r\nheard my mother say that her grandmother was a descendant of Dr. John\r\nOwen, Chaplain of Oliver Cromwell. A piece of silver bearing the Owen\r\ncoat of arms is still in the possession of a member of my family. He\r\nentered the British navy, changed his name to Carr, and soon rose to the\r\nrank of Post-Captain. He eventually drifted back to America and died\r\nunmarried at my grandfather's home on Long Island many years after the\r\nwar. The trite saying that history repeats itself is here forcibly\r\nillustrated by brother fighting against brother. It brings to mind our\r\nown fraternal troubles during the Civil War, which can never be effaced\r\nfrom memory.\r\n\r\nMuch of the furniture of my first home was purchased from Citizen Genet\r\nwhen my grandfather took possession of the house and farm. We understood\r\nthat the French minister brought it with him from France, and many of\r\nthe pieces, some of which are mahogany, are still in my possession. A\r\nbedstead which I still occupy has been said to be the first of its\r\ndesign brought from France to this country. Hanging in my bedroom is a\r\nset of engravings entitled \"Diligence and Dissipation,\" after Hogarth,\r\nand also a handsome old print of the Savior in the Pharisee's House, all\r\nof which were purchased at the same time. Two alabaster ornaments are\r\nmemories of my earliest childhood, one of which was a column casting a\r\nshadow that formed a likeness of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nMy Grandfather Hazard had many slaves, and I remember hearing of one of\r\nthem who ran away and took with him a carriage and pair of horses, and,\r\nwho, when called to account for the act, threatened my grandfather's\r\nlife. My mother, although suffering from a severe indisposition, ran out\r\nof the house for succor. The slave was taken into custody, and was\r\neventually sent South and sold. Some of the other slaves I well\r\nremember. Among them was a very old couple with numerous progeny who\r\nlived not far from us in a hut in the woods on the Hazard estate. In\r\nsubsequent years I heard my mother remark, upon the occasion of a\r\nmarriage in the family connection, that when \"Cuff\" and \"Sary\" were\r\nmarried her father gave the clergyman five dollars for his services.\r\nCuff was an old-fashioned, festive negro born in this country, and with\r\nthe firm belief that existence was bestowed upon him solely for his own\r\nenjoyment. He possessed a genius for discovering holidays, and added\r\nmany to the calendar that were new to most of us. For example, sometimes\r\nwhen he was given a task to accomplish, he would announce that he could\r\nnot work upon that day as it was \"Paas Monday,\" or \"Paas Tuesday,\" and\r\nso on, continuing as the case required, through the week. He had supreme\r\ncontempt for what he called \"Guinea niggers,\" a term he applied to those\r\nof his race who came directly from Africa, in contradistinction to those\r\nwho had been born in this country. One of Cuff's predecessors in the\r\nHazard family was named Ben, and I have the original deed of his\r\npurchase from Hendrick Suydam, dated April 28th, 1807. The price paid\r\nwas two hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the village of Jamaica was a well known academy where my mother\r\nreceived the early part of her education. One of her preceptors there\r\nwas the Hon. Luther Bradish, who some years later became Lieutenant\r\nGovernor of the State of New York, and who at the time of his death was\r\npresident of the New York Historical Society. Her education was\r\ncontinued at Miss Sarah Pierce's school in Litchfield, Connecticut, one\r\nof the most fashionable educational institutions of that period. I have\r\nheard my mother say that, accompanied by her father, she made the\r\njourney to Litchfield in a chariot, the name applied to carriages in\r\nthose days, this, of course, being before there was any rail\r\ncommunication with that place. In close proximity to Miss Pierce's\r\nestablishment was the law school of Judge James Gould, whose pupils were\r\na great social resource to Miss Pierce's scholars. This institution was\r\npatronized by many pupils from the South, and during my mother's time\r\nJohn C. Calhoun was one of its students. A few years ago a history of\r\nthe school was published, and a copy of the book was loaned me by the\r\nlate Mrs. Lucius Tuckerman of Washington, whose mother was educated\r\nthere and whose grandfather was the celebrated Oliver Wolcott of\r\nConnecticut. After my mother's marriage, she and my father visited Miss\r\nPierce in Litchfield. This was during the Jackson campaign, while\r\npolitical excitement ran so very high that a prominent physician of the\r\nplace remarked to my father, in perfectly good faith, that Jackson could\r\nnot possibly be elected President as he would receive no support from\r\nLitchfield.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica was the last residence of the Honorable Rufus King, our\r\nminister to England under Washington and twenty years later a candidate\r\nfor the presidency. His son, Charles King, was the beloved President of\r\nColumbia College in New York, and his few surviving students hold his\r\nmemory in reverence. The house in which the King family resided was a\r\nstately structure with an _entourage_ of fine old trees. It eventually\r\npassed into other hands, and a few years ago the entire property was\r\ngenerously donated by the Daughters of the American Revolution to the\r\ntown of Jamaica, and is now called \"King's Manor.\"\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, Captain John Hazard, was about fifty years old at the\r\ntime of his marriage to my grandmother, Miss Leupp, of New Jersey, who\r\ndied soon after, leaving an only child, my mother. A few years later he\r\nmarried Lydia Blackwell at her home on Blackwell's Island, which her\r\nfather, Jacob Blackwell, had inherited from his father, Jacob Blackwell,\r\nthe son of Robert Blackwell, who was the progenitor of the family in\r\nthis country and gave his name to the island upon which he resided.\r\nSeveral years later Captain Hazard was heard to remark that matrimony\r\nwas a lottery, and that he had drawn two prizes. I have in my possession\r\nan old letter written by Miss Blackwell to my grandfather previous to\r\ntheir marriage, which is so quaint and formal that I am tempted to give\r\nit in full:\r\n\r\n     Miss Blackwell's compliments to Captain Hazard and desires\r\n     to know how he does--and if well enough will be glad to see\r\n     him the first leisure day--as she has something of\r\n     consequence to communicate and is sorry to hear that he has\r\n     been so much indisposed as to deprive his friends of the\r\n     pleasure of his company for this last fortnight--May you\r\n     enjoy every happiness this imperfect estate affords is the\r\n     sincere wish of your friend,\r\n\r\n          L. B.\r\n\r\n     Let me see you on Sunday.\r\n\r\n     Burn this.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hazard brought his new bride to the old home on the Rockaway\r\nRoad where I was subsequently born, and she immediately took under her\r\nprotecting wing my mother, who was then but little more than an infant.\r\nThe babe grew and thrived, and never knew until she was a good-sized\r\ngirl that the woman who had so lovingly nurtured her was only a\r\nstep-mother. She learned the fact from a schoolmate who told her out of\r\nrevenge for some fancied wrong; and I shall always remember my mother\r\ntelling me how she hurried home feeling all the time that the cruel\r\nstory was untrue, only to have it confirmed by the lips of the woman who\r\nhad been as affectionate and unselfish as any mother could possibly have\r\nbeen to her own child. In subsequent years, when my mother gathered her\r\nown children around her, she held her step-mother up to us as the\r\nembodiment of all female virtue and excellence, all of which is\r\nconfirmed by my own recollection of her remarkable character and\r\nexemplary life.\r\n\r\nOn the farm adjoining us lived a crusty old bachelor by the name of\r\nMartin, who in his earlier life had been professionally associated with\r\nAaron Burr. No human being was allowed to cross his threshold, but I\r\nrecall that years after his death I saw a large quantity of silver which\r\nhe had inherited, and which bore a martin for a crest. He was a terror\r\nto all the children in our vicinity, and it was his habit to walk on the\r\nneighboring roads clad in a dressing gown. More than once as I passed\r\nhim he accosted me with the interrogative, \"Are you Nancy Hazard's\r\nbrat?\"--a query that invariably prompted me to quicken my pace. Mr.\r\nMartin kept a fine herd of cattle, among which was an obstreperous bull\r\nwhose stentorian tones were familiar to all the residents of the\r\nadjoining places. When the children of our household were turbulent my\r\nmother would often exclaim, \"Listen to Martin's bull roaring!\" This\r\ninvariably had a soothing effect upon the children, and strange to say\r\nthis trivial incident has descended among my kindred to the fourth\r\ngeneration, for my mother's great-grandchildren are as familiar with\r\n\"Martin's bull\" as my sisters and brothers and I were in our own\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nMalcolm Campbell, my paternal grandfather, left Scotland subsequently to\r\nour Revolution, accompanied by his wife and son James (my father), and\r\nafter a passage of several weeks landed in New York. His wife was Miss\r\nLucy McClellan. His father, Alexander Campbell, fought in the battle of\r\nCulloden, and I have heard my father say that his grandfather's regiment\r\nmarched to the song of:\r\n\r\n    \"Who wadna fight for Charlie?\r\n       Who wadna draw the sword?\r\n     Who wadna up and rally,\r\n       At their royal prince's word?\r\n     Think on Scotia's ancient heroes,\r\n       Think on foreign foes repell'd,\r\n     Think on glorious Bruce and Wallace,\r\n       Who the proud usurpers quell'd.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said he had previously been sent to Italy to collect arms and\r\nammunition for the \"Young Pretender,\" the grandson of James II. The\r\nbattle of Culloden, which was fought on the 16th of April, 1746, and\r\nwhich has often been called the \"Culloden Massacre,\" caused the whole\r\ncivilized world to stand aghast. The order of the Duke of Cumberland to\r\ngrant no quarter to prisoners placed him foremost in the ranks of\r\n\"British beasts\" that have disgraced the pages of history, and earned\r\nfor him the unenviable title of \"The Butcher of Culloden.\" It has been\r\nsuggested in extenuation of his fiendish conduct that His Grace was\r\n\"deep in his cups\" the night before the battle, and that the General to\r\nwhom the order was given, realizing the condition of the Duke, insisted\r\nthat his instructions should be reduced to writing. His Grace thereupon\r\nangrily seized a playing card from the table where he was engaged in\r\ngambling, and complied with the request. This card happened to be the\r\nnine of diamonds, and to this day is known as \"the curse of Scotland.\" A\r\nlong period elapsed before those who had sympathized with the Young\r\nPretender's cause were restored to the good graces of the English\r\nthrone, and it was Scotland that was compelled to bear the brunt of the\r\nroyal displeasure. The sins of the fathers were visited upon their\r\nchildren, and it is not at all unlikely that the sympathies of Alexander\r\nCampbell's son, Malcolm (my grandfather), for the last of the House of\r\nStuart developed a chain of circumstances that resulted, with other\r\ncauses, in his embarkation for America.\r\n\r\nDuring the early period of my childhood I became familiar with the\r\nJacobite songs which my father used to sing, and which had been handed\r\ndown in the Campbell family. I was so deeply imbued during my early life\r\nwith the Jacobite spirit of my forefathers that when I read the account\r\nin my English history of George I, carrying with him his little\r\ndissolute Hanoverian Court and crossing the water to England to become\r\nKing of Great Britain, I felt even at that late day that the act was a\r\npersonal grievance. Through the passage of many years a fragment of one\r\nof these Jacobite songs still rings in my ears:\r\n\r\n    \"There's nae luck aboot the hoose,\r\n       There's nae luck ava [at all];\r\n     There's little pleasure in the hoose\r\n       When our gude man's awa.\"\r\n\r\nEven now some of those songs appeal to me possibly in the same manner as\r\nthe \"Marseillaise\" to the French, or the \"Ranz de Vaches\" to the Swiss\r\nwho have wandered from their mountain homes, or as the strains of our\r\nnational hymn affect my own fellow countrymen in foreign lands, whose\r\nhearts are made to throb when with uncovered heads they listen, and are\r\ncarried back in memory to the days of \"auld lang syne.\"\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, Malcolm Campbell, received the degree of Master of Arts\r\nfrom the University of St. Andrews, the great school of Scottish\r\nLatinity, and his diploma conferring upon him that honor is still in the\r\npossession of his descendants. Before leaving Scotland he had formed an\r\nintimacy with Andrew Picken, and during the voyage to America enjoyed\r\nthe pleasing companionship of that gentleman together with his wife and\r\ntheir two children. Mrs. Picken was the only daughter of Sir Charles\r\nBurdette of London, whose wife was the daughter of the Earl of Wyndham.\r\nShe and Andrew Picken, who was a native of Stewarton, in Ayrshire, a\r\nyounger branch of a noble family, four years previously had made a\r\nclandestine marriage and, after vainly attempting to effect a\r\nreconciliation with her father, resolved upon emigrating to America.\r\nTheir daughter, Mrs. Sara Jane Picken Cohen, widow of the Rev. Dr.\r\nAbraham H. Cohen of Richmond, Virginia, wrote the memoirs of her life,\r\nand in describing her parents' voyage to this country says: \"It was one\r\nof those old-time voyages, of nine weeks and three days, from land to\r\nland, and a very boisterous one it was. There had been a terrific storm,\r\nwhich had raged violently for several days.\" This friendship formed in\r\nthe mother country was naturally much strengthened during the long\r\nvoyage, and when the two families finally reached New York, Mrs. Cohen\r\nwrites: \"Here we settled down our two families, strangers in a strange\r\nland. But the lamp of friendship burned brightly and lit us on the way;\r\nour children grew up together in early childhood, and as brothers and\r\nsisters were born in each family they were named in succession after\r\neach other.\" It is pleasant to state that this friendship formed so many\r\ngenerations ago is still continued in my family, as my daughters and I\r\nfrequently enjoy in our Washington home the pleasing society of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Roberdeau Buchanan, the latter of whom is the great granddaughter\r\nof Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Picken.\r\n\r\nSoon after his arrival in New York Malcolm Campbell established a\r\nclassical school at 85 Broadway nearly opposite Trinity Church. He\r\nedited the first American edition of Cicero's orations and of Cæsar's\r\ncommentaries, and also revised and corrected and published in 1808\r\nl'Abbé Tardy's French dictionary. His first edition of Cicero is\r\ndedicated to the \"Right Reverend Benjamin Moore, D.D., Bishop of the\r\nProtestant Episcopal Church in the State of New York, and President of\r\nColumbia College,\" and another edition with the same text and imprint is\r\ndedicated, in several pages of Latin, to the learned Samuel L. Mitchell,\r\nM.D. He and his wife were buried in the graveyard of the Wall Street\r\nPresbyterian Church. It may not be inappropriate in this connection to\r\nrefer to another instructor of an even earlier period which has come\r\nwithin my notice, who taught reading, writing and arithmetic \"with\r\nbecoming accuracy.\" In _The New York Journal Or The General Advertiser_\r\nof the 30th of April, 1772, appears the following advertisement:\r\n\r\n     THE RESPECTABLE PUBLIC is hereby informed that, agreeable to\r\n     a former advertisement, a Seminary of Learning was opened at\r\n     New Brunswick, last November, by the name of _Queen's\r\n     College_,[1] and also a Grammar School, in order to prepare\r\n     Youth for the same. Any Parents or Guardians who may be\r\n     inclined to send their Children to this Institution, may\r\n     depend upon having them instructed with the greatest Care\r\n     and Diligence in all the Arts and Sciences usually taught in\r\n     public Schools; the strictest Regard will be paid to their\r\n     moral Conduct, (and in a word) to every Thing which may tend\r\n     to render them a Pleasure to their Friends, and an Ornament\r\n     to their Species.\r\n\r\n     Also to obviate the Objection of some to sending their\r\n     Children on Account of their small Proficiency in English, a\r\n     proper Person has been provided, who attends at the Grammar\r\n     School an Hour a Day, and teaches Reading, Writing and\r\n     Arithmetic with becoming Accuracy--It is hoped that the\r\n     above Considerations, together with the healthy and\r\n     convenient Situation of the Place, on a Pleasant and\r\n     navigable River, in the midst of a plentiful Country; the\r\n     Reasonableness of the Inhabitants in the Price of Board, and\r\n     the easy Access from all Places, either by Land or Water\r\n     will be esteemed by the considerate Public, as a sufficient\r\n     Recommendation of this infant College, which (as it is\r\n     erected upon so Catholic a Plan) will undoubtedly prove\r\n     _advantageous_ to our new American World, by assisting its\r\n     SISTER SEMMINARIES to cultivate Piety, Learning, and\r\n     Liberty.\r\n\r\n          _Per Order of the Trustees_,\r\n\r\n               FREDERICK FRELINGHUYSEN, Tutor.\r\n\r\n     N.B. The Vacation of the College will be expired on\r\n     Wednesday the 6th of May, any Students then offering\r\n     themselves shall be admitted into such Class, as (upon\r\n     Examination) they shall be found capable of entering.\r\n\r\nThe signer of this interesting advertisement was graduated from\r\nPrinceton College in 1770, and subsequently became a lawyer. His\r\ndistinguished son, Theodore, was widely known as a philanthropist and\r\nChristian statesman, and at various periods was United States Senator,\r\nChancellor of the New York University, President of Rutgers College, a\r\ncandidate for the Vice Presidency of the United States, and President of\r\nthe American Bible Society. A grandson of the signer was the Hon.\r\nFrederick Theodore Frelinghuysen, the well remembered United States\r\nSenator and Secretary of State under President Arthur.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Frelinghuysen family, I recall an amusing story told at\r\nthe expense of Newark, New Jersey. When the late Secretary Frelinghuysen\r\npresented himself at the gates of Heaven he was surprised not to be\r\nrecognized by St. Peter, who asked him who he was. \"I am the Hon.\r\nFrederick T. Frelinghuysen,\" was the response. \"From where?\" \"Newark,\r\nNew Jersey.\" \"Newark?\" quoth St. Peter, \"I never heard of that place,\r\nbut I will look on my list. No, it isn't there. I can not admit you, Mr.\r\nFrelinghuysen.\" So the old gentleman proceeded and knocked at another\r\ngate in the boundless immensity. The devil opened it and looked out. The\r\nsame conversation occurred as with St. Peter. Newark wasn't \"on the\r\nlist.\" \"My Heavens, Mr. Satan, am I then doomed to return to Newark?\"\r\nexclaimed the New Jersey statesman, and went back to the Newark\r\ngraveyard.\r\n\r\nMy father, James Campbell, was born in Callander, Scotland, and, as I\r\nhave before stated, came to this country with his parents as a very\r\nyoung child. Both he and his father were clad in their Highland dress\r\nupon their arrival in New York. His childhood was spent in the great\r\nmetropolis, and he subsequently studied law in Albany, with the Hon.\r\nSamuel Miles Hopkins, the grandfather of Mrs. Arent Schuyler\r\nCrowninshield. He was admitted to the bar, and almost immediately became\r\na Master in Chancery. In 1821 he was appointed Surrogate of New York, a\r\nposition which he retained for twenty years. He was always a pronounced\r\ndemocrat, but notwithstanding this fact he was reappointed ten\r\nsuccessive times. In 1840, however, the Whig party was in the ascendency\r\nin the New York Legislature, and through the instrumentality of William\r\nH. Seward, who introduced a system called \"pipe laying,\" the whole\r\npolitical atmosphere was changed. \"Pipe laying\" was an organized scheme\r\nfor controlling votes, and derived its name from certain political\r\nmanipulations connected with the introduction of Croton water in New\r\nYork City. I have learned in later years that more approved methods are\r\nfrequently used for controlling votes. Modern ethics has discovered a\r\nmore satisfactory method through means of powerful corporations with\r\ncoffers wide open in the holy cause of electing candidates.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate state of affairs resulted in the removal of my father\r\nfrom office, and he immediately resumed the practice of law. Some of his\r\ndecisions as Surrogate are regarded as precedents to this day. Two of\r\nthe most prominent of these are \"Watts and LeRoy vs. Public\r\nAdministrator\" (a decision resulting in the establishment of the Leake\r\nand Watts Orphan House) and \"In the matter of the last Will and\r\nTestament of Alice Lispenard, deceased.\" He is said to have owned about\r\nthis time the largest private library in New York City, composed largely\r\nof foreign imprints, as he seemed to have but little regard for American\r\neditions. The classical portion of his library, especially the volumes\r\npublished in Paris, was regarded as unusually choice and well selected.\r\nHe had also a large collection of Greek Testaments which he read in\r\npreference to the translations. He owned a copy of Didot's Virgil and I\r\nhave always understood that, with the exception of one owned in the\r\nBrevoort family of New York, it was at that time the only copy in\r\nAmerica. He retained his scholarly tastes throughout his whole life, and\r\nin looking back I delight to picture him as seated in his library\r\nsurrounded by his beloved books. In 1850, about two years after his\r\ndeath, his library was sold at auction, the catalogue of which covers\r\n114 closely printed pages. Among the purchasers were William E. Burton,\r\nthe actor, Chief Justice Charles P. Daly and Henry W. Longfellow.\r\n\r\nProfessor Charles Anthon of Columbia College dedicated his Horace to my\r\nfather in the following choice words:\r\n\r\n                            To\r\n                  My old & valued friend\r\n                   James Campbell, Esq.,\r\n     who, amid the graver duties of a judicial station,\r\n        can still find leisure to gratify a pure and\r\n              cultivated taste, by reviving the\r\n                 studies of earlier years.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Professor Anthon, the original of which is\r\nstill retained by the family, was addressed to my mother shortly after\r\nmy father's death.\r\n\r\n     COL[UMBIA] COLL[EGE], Sep. 3d 1849.\r\n\r\n     Dear Madam,\r\n\r\n     I dedicated the accompanying work to your lamented husband\r\n     in happier years, while he was still in the full career of\r\n     honourable usefulness; and, now that death has taken him\r\n     from us, I deem it but right that the volume which bore his\r\n     name while living, should still continue to be a memento of\r\n     him. May I request you to accept this humble but sincere\r\n     tribute to the memory of a most valued friend?\r\n\r\n          I remain, very respectfully and truly,\r\n\r\n               CHAS. ANTHON.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Campbell,\r\n          Houston Street.\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Anthon was about forty-eight years of age Edgar Allan Poe\r\ndescribed him as \"about five feet, eight inches in height; rather stout;\r\nfair complexion; hair light and inclined to curl; forehead remarkably\r\nbroad and high; eye gray, clear, and penetrating; mouth well-formed,\r\nwith excellent teeth--the lips having great flexibility, and consequent\r\npower of expression; the smile particularly pleasing. His address in\r\ngeneral is bold, frank, cordial, full of _bonhomie_. His whole air is\r\n_distingué_ in the best understanding of the term--that is to say, he\r\nwould impress anyone at first sight with the idea of his being no\r\nordinary man. He has qualities, indeed, which would have assured him\r\neminent success in almost any pursuit; and there are times in which his\r\nfriends are half disposed to regret his exclusive devotion to classical\r\nliterature.\"\r\n\r\nMy father was a trustee of the venerable New York Society Library and\r\none of the directors of the old United States Bank in Philadelphia; and\r\nI have in my possession a number of interesting letters from Nicholas\r\nBiddle, its president, addressed to him and asking his advice and\r\ncounsel. For eighteen years he was a trustee of Columbia College in New\r\nYork, and enjoyed the close friendship of President William A. Duer,\r\nReverend and Professor John McVickar, James Renwick, Professor of\r\nChemistry, whose mother, Jennie Jeffery, was Burns's \"Blue-e'ed\r\nLassie,\" and Professor Charles Anthon, all of whom filled chairs in\r\nthat institution with unquestioned ability. My father was also a member\r\nof the St. Andrews Society of New York. After his death, President Duer\r\nin an impressive address alluded to him in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"Two of our associates with whom I have been similarly connected and\r\nhave known from boyhood have also departed, leaving sweet memories\r\nbehind them, James Campbell and David S. Jones, the former a scholar and\r\na ripe and good one, once honoring the choice of his fellow citizens and\r\nwinning golden opinions as Surrogate of this city and county.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Duer had a most interesting family of children. His eldest\r\nmarried daughter, Frances Maria, was the wife of Henry Shaeffe Hoyt of\r\nPark Place, and died recently in Newport at a very advanced age. Eleanor\r\nJones Duer, another daughter, married George T. Wilson, an Englishman.\r\nShe was a great beauty, bearing a striking resemblance to Fanny Kemble,\r\nand was remarkable for her strong intellect. Her marriage was\r\nclandestine, and the cause, as far as I know, was never explained. Still\r\nanother daughter, Elizabeth, married Archibald Gracie King of Weehawken,\r\nand was a Colonial Dame of much prominence in her later years. She was\r\nthe mother of the authoress, Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer. President\r\nDuer's wife was Hannah Maria Denning of Fishkill, New York. I knew her\r\nonly as an elderly woman possessing a fine presence and social tastes.\r\n\r\nIn my early life the students of Columbia College enjoyed playing\r\npractical jokes upon its dignified professors. As an illustration, I\r\nremember once seeing the death of Professor Renwick fictitiously\r\npublished in one of the daily journals, much to the sorrow and\r\nsubsequently the indignation of a large circle of friends. Professor\r\nAnthon, too, although a confirmed bachelor, had to face his turn, and\r\nhis marriage to some unknown bride bearing an assumed name was an\r\noccasional announcement. But the most amusing feature of the joke would\r\nappear in the morning, when an emphatic denial would be seen in the\r\ncolumns of the same newspaper, accompanied by a quotation in spurious\r\nLatin. Professor Anthon lived with his two spinster sisters in one of\r\nthe college buildings, and their home was a rendezvous for an\r\nappreciative younger generation. In connection with his duties at the\r\ncollege, he was the head of the Columbia College Grammar School, and I\r\nhave always understood that he strictly followed the scriptural\r\ninjunction not \"to spare the rod.\" His victims were repeatedly heard to\r\nremark that these flagellations partially counterbalanced the lack of\r\nexercise which he felt very keenly in his sedentary life. But with all\r\nhis austerity his pupils would occasionally be astonished over the\r\namount of humor that he was capable of displaying. His handwriting was\r\nexquisitely minute in character, and I have in my possession two\r\nvalentines composed by him and sent to me which are quaintly beautiful\r\nin language and, although sixty years old, are still in a perfect state\r\nof preservation.\r\n\r\n                   _To Miss Marian Campbell._\r\n    The Campbell is coming! Ye Gentles beware,\r\n    For Don Cupid lies hid in her dark flowing hair,\r\n    And her eyes, bright as stars that in mid-heaven roll,\r\n    Pierce through frock-coat and dickey right into the soul!\r\n    And ye lips which the coral might envy, I ween,\r\n    And ye pearl rows that peep from the red lips between,\r\n    And that soft-dimpled cheek, with the hue of the rose,\r\n    And that smile which bears conquest wherever it goes,\r\n    Oh, could I but think that you soon would be mine,\r\n    I'd send Marian each morning a sweet valentine.\r\n      Feb'y 14, 1844.\r\n\r\n(Written a few years later.)\r\n\r\n    Sweet girl! within whose laughing eye\r\n    A thousand little Cupids lie,\r\n    While every curl, that floats above\r\n    Thy noble brow, seems fraught with love.\r\n\r\n    Oh, list to me, my loved one, list!\r\n    Thy Tellkampf's suit no more resist,\r\n    But give to him, to call his own,\r\n    A heart where Kings might make their throne.\r\n\r\nJohn Louis Tellkampf, to whom Anthon so facetiously alludes in the\r\nsecond valentine, was a young German who frequently came to our house,\r\nand who, through my father's aid and influence, in subsequent years\r\nbecame professor of German in Columbia College. When we first knew him\r\nhe spoke English with much difficulty, and it was a standing joke in our\r\nhousehold that once when he desired to say that a certain person had\r\nbeen born he expressed the fact as \"getting alive.\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm Campbell, a younger brother of mine, was graduated in 1850 from\r\nColumbia College near the head of his class. Among his classmates were\r\nCharles Seymour, subsequently Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church\r\nof Illinois, and the distinguished lawyer Frederick R. Coudert, whose\r\nfather kept a boys' French school in Bleecker Street. My brother\r\nsubsequently studied law in the office of Judge Henry Hilton, and for\r\nmany years practiced at the New York bar. Upon a certain occasion he and\r\nSamuel F. Kneeland were opposing counsel in an important suit during\r\nwhich Mr. Kneeland kept quoting from his own work upon \"Mechanics'\r\nLiens.\" My brother endured this as long as his patience permitted and\r\nthen, slowly rising to his feet, said: \"I have cited decisions on the\r\npoint in controversy, but my learned opponent cites nothing except his\r\nown opinions printed in his own book. With such persistency has he done\r\nthis that I have been tempted to write these lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, Kneeland! dear Kneeland, pray what do you mean\r\n     By such a fat book on the subject of Lien?\r\n     Was it for glory or was it for pelf,\r\n     Or just for the pleasure of quoting yourself?\"\r\n\r\nIt seems almost needless to add that this doggerel was followed by a\r\nround of applause, and that Chief Justice Charles P. Daly and Judge\r\nJoseph F. Daly, as well as Judge George M. Van Hoesen, who were on the\r\nbench at this time, joined in the merriment.\r\n\r\nThe commencement exercises of Columbia College, as I remember them, took\r\nplace every summer in St. John's Church opposite St. John's Park, and I\r\noften attended them in my early days. Columbia College at this period\r\nwas in the lower part of the city between College and Park Places, and\r\nwas the original King's College of colonial days. All of the professors\r\nlived in the college buildings in a most unostentatious manner, and I\r\nreadily recall frequent instances during my early childhood when, in\r\ncompany with my father, I walked to the college and took a simple six\r\no'clock supper with Professor Anthon and his sisters.\r\n\r\nMy mother met my father while visiting in New York, and the acquaintance\r\neventually resulted in a runaway marriage. They were married on the 10th\r\nof June, 1818, and nine days later the following notice appeared in _The\r\nNational Advocate_:\r\n\r\n     _Married._\r\n\r\n     At Flushing, L.I., by the Rev. Mr. [Barzilla] Buckley, James\r\n     Campbell esq. of this city, to Miss Mary Ann Hazard,\r\n     daughter of John Hazard, esq. of Jamaica, Long Island.\r\n\r\nThe objection of my Grandfather Hazard to my mother's marriage was not\r\nunnatural, as she was his only child, and being at this time well\r\nadvanced in years he dreaded the separation. But the happy bride\r\nimmediately brought her husband to live in the old home where she had\r\nbeen born, where the young couple began their married life under\r\npleasing auspices, and my father continued his practice of law in New\r\nYork. I had the misfortune of being a second daughter. Traditionally, I\r\nknow that my grandfather most earnestly desired a grandson at that time,\r\nand when the nurse announced my birth, she was not sufficiently\r\ncourageous to tell the truth, and said: \"A boy, sir!\" Her faltering\r\nmanner possibly betrayed her, as the sarcastic retort was: \"I dare say,\r\nan Irish boy.\"\r\n\r\nMy ambitious parents sent me with my oldest sister, Fanny, at the early\r\nage of four, to a school in the village of Jamaica conducted by Miss\r\nDelia Bacon. My recollection of events occurring at this early period is\r\nnot very vivid, but I still recall the vision of three beautiful women,\r\nDelia, Alice and Julia Bacon, who presided over our school. This\r\ninteresting trio were nieces of the distinguished author and divine, the\r\nRev. Dr. Leonard Bacon, who for fifty-seven years was pastor of the\r\nFirst Congregational Church of New Haven. Many years subsequent to my\r\nschool days, Delia Bacon became, as is well known, an enthusiastic\r\nadvocate of the Baconian authorship of Shakespeare's plays. I have\r\nunderstood that she made a pilgrimage to Stratford-on-Avon hoping to\r\nsecure the proper authority to reopen Shakespeare's grave, a desire,\r\nhowever, that remained ungratified. She was a woman of remarkable\r\nability, and I have in my possession the book, written by her nephew,\r\nwhich tells the story of her life. I was Miss Bacon's youngest pupil,\r\nand attended school regularly in company with my sister, whither we were\r\ndriven each morning in the family carriage. My studies were not\r\ndifficult, and my principal recollection is my playing out of doors with\r\na dog named Sancho, while the older children were busy inside with their\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nDuring my Long Island life, as a very young child, I was visiting my\r\naunts in Jay Street, New York, when I was taken to Grant Thorburn's seed\r\nshop in Maiden Lane, which I think was called \"The Arcade.\" There was\r\nmuch there to delight the childish fancy--canaries, parrots, and other\r\nbirds of varied plumage. Thorburn's career was decidedly unusual. He\r\nwas born in Scotland, where he worked in his father's shop as a\r\nnailmaker. He came to New York in 1794 and for a time continued at his\r\nold trade. He then kept a seed store and, after making quite a fortune,\r\nlaunched into a literary career and wrote under the _nom de plume_ of\r\n\"Laurie Todd.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Now Rutgers College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nNEW YORK AND SOME NEW YORKERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 1828 my parents moved to New York, and immediately occupied the\r\nhouse, No. 6 Hubert Street, purchased by my father, and pleasantly\r\nlocated a short distance from St. John's Park, then the fashionable\r\nsection of the city. This park was always kept locked, but it was the\r\ncommon play-ground of the children of the neighborhood, whose families\r\nwere furnished with keys, as is the case with Gramercy Park to-day. St.\r\nJohn's Church overlooked this park, and the houses on the other three\r\nsides of the square were among the finest residences in the city. Many\r\nof them were occupied by families of prominence, among which were those\r\nof Watts, Gibbes, Kemble, Hamilton and Smedberg. Next door to us on\r\nHubert Street lived Commander, subsequently Rear Admiral, Charles\r\nWilkes, U.S.N., and his young family. His first wife was Miss Jane\r\nJeffrey Renwick, who was a sister of Professor James Renwick of Columbia\r\nCollege, and after her death he married Mary Lynch, a daughter of Henry\r\nLynch of New York and the widow of Captain William Compton Bolton of the\r\nNavy. This, of course, was previous to his naval achievements, which are\r\nsuch well known events in American history. In after life Admiral and\r\nMrs. Wilkes moved to Washington, D.C., where I renewed my friendship of\r\nearly days and where members of his family still reside, beloved and\r\nrespected by the whole community.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas S. Gibbes of South Carolina, whose wife was Miss Susan\r\nAnnette Vanden Heuvel, daughter of John C. Vanden Heuvel, a wealthy\r\nland owner, lived on Hudson Street, facing St. John's Park. Their elder\r\ndaughter Charlotte Augusta, who married John Jacob Astor, son of William\r\nB. Astor, was an early playmate of mine, and many pleasant memories of\r\nher as a little girl cluster around St. John's Park, where we romped\r\ntogether. When I first knew the Gibbes family it had recently returned\r\nfrom a long residence in Paris, an unusual experience in these days, and\r\nboth Charlotte Augusta and her younger sister, Annette Gibbes, sang in a\r\nvery pleasing manner French songs, which were a decided novelty to our\r\njuvenile ears. Mrs. Gibbes's sisters were Mrs. Gouverneur S. Bibby and\r\nMrs. John C. Hamilton.\r\n\r\nDirectly opposite St. John's Park, on the corner of Varick and Beach\r\nstreets, was Miss Maria Forbes's school for young girls, which was the\r\nfashionable school of the day. I attended it in company with my sister\r\nFanny and my brother James who was my junior. Miss Forbes occasionally\r\nadmitted boys to her school when accompanied by older sisters. Our life\r\nthere was regulated in accordance with the strictest principles of\r\nlearning and etiquette, and a child would have been deficient indeed who\r\nfailed to acquire knowledge under the tuition of such an able teacher.\r\nSchool commenced promptly at eight o'clock and continued without\r\nintermission until three.\r\n\r\nThe principal of the school was the daughter of John Forbes, who for\r\nthirty years was the librarian of the New York Society Library. He was a\r\nnative of Aberdeen in Scotland, and was brought to this country in\r\nextreme youth by a widowed mother of marked determination and piety,\r\nwith the intention of launching him successfully in life. He early\r\ndisplayed a fondness for books, and must have shown an uncommon maturity\r\nof mind and much executive ability, as he was only nineteen when he was\r\nappointed to the position just named. It is an interesting fact that he\r\naccepted the librarianship in 1798 with a salary of two hundred and\r\nfifty dollars a year in addition to the fines and two and a half per\r\ncent. upon all moneys collected, besides the use or rental of the lower\r\nfront room of the library building. After many years of labor his salary\r\nwas raised to five hundred dollars. Upon his death in October, 1824, the\r\ntrustees, out of respect to his memory, voted to attend his funeral in a\r\nbody and ordered the library closed for the remaining four days of the\r\nweek. He married Miss Martha Skidmore, daughter of Lemuel Skidmore, a\r\nprominent iron and steel merchant of New York, and I have no doubt that\r\nMaria Forbes, their daughter and my early teacher, inherited her\r\nscholarly tastes from her father, of whom Dr. John W. Francis in his\r\n\"Old New York\" justly speaks as a \"learned man.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Forbes was a pronounced disciplinarian, and administered one form\r\nof punishment which left a lasting impression upon my memory. For\r\ncertain trivial offenses a child was placed in a darkened room and\r\nclothed in a tow apron. One day I was subjected to this punishment for\r\nmany hours, an incident which naturally I have never yet been able to\r\nforget. On the occasion referred to Miss Forbes was obliged to leave the\r\nschoolroom for a few minutes and, unfortunately for my happiness,\r\nappointed my young brother James to act as monitor during her absence.\r\nHis first experience in the exercise of a little authority evidently\r\nturned his head, for upon the return of our teacher I was reported for\r\nmisbehavior. The charge against me was that I had smiled. It is too long\r\nago to remember whether or not it was a smile of derision, but upon\r\nmature reflection I think it must have been. I knew, however, in my\r\nchildish heart that I had committed no serious offense and, as can\r\nreadily be imagined, my indignation was boundless. It was the first act\r\nof injustice I had ever experienced. Feeling that the punishment was\r\nundeserved, and smarting under it, with abundance of leisure upon my\r\nhands, I bit the tough tow apron into many pieces. When Miss Forbes\r\nafter a few hours, which seemed to me an eternity, came to relieve me\r\nfrom my irksome position and noticed the condition of the apron, she\r\nregaled me with a homily upon the evils of bad temper, and gave as\r\npractical illustrations the lives of some of our most noted criminals,\r\nall of whom had expiated their crimes upon the gallows.\r\n\r\nIn recalling these early school days it seems to me that the rudiments\r\nof education received far more attention then than now. Spelling was\r\nregarded as of chief importance and due consideration was given to\r\ngrammar. There were no \"frills\" then, such as physical culture, manual\r\ntraining and the like, and vacation lasted but thirty days, usually\r\nduring the month of August. Some of my earliest friendships were formed\r\nat Miss Forbes's school, many of which I have retained through a long\r\nlife. Among my companions and classmates were the Tillotsons, Lynches,\r\nAstors, Kembles, Hamiltons, Duers, and Livingstons.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the severe discipline of Miss Forbes's school, her\r\npupils occasionally engaged in current gossip. It was in her schoolroom\r\nI first made the discovery that this earth boasted of such valuable\r\nadjuncts to the human family as title-bearing gentlemen, and in this\r\nparticular case it was a live Count that was brought to my notice. Count\r\nLouis Fitzgerald Tasistro had recently arrived in New York, and his\r\nengagement to Adelaide Lynch, a daughter of Judge James Lynch, of an old\r\nNew York family, was soon announced. On the voyage to America he had\r\nmade the acquaintance of a son of Lord Henry Gage of England, whose\r\nprincipal object in visiting this country was to make the acquaintance\r\nof his kinsman, Mr. Gouverneur Kemble. Through his instrumentality\r\nTasistro was introduced into New York's most exclusive set, and soon\r\nbecame the lion of the hour. We girls discussed the engagement and\r\nsubsequent marriage of the distinguished foreigner (_sub rosa_, of\r\ncourse), and to our childish vision pictured a wonderful career for this\r\nNew York girl. The marriage, however, soon terminated unfortunately, and\r\nto the day of his death Tasistro's origin remained a mystery. He was an\r\nintellectual man of fine presence and skilled in a number of foreign\r\nlanguages. He claimed he was a graduate of Dublin College. Many years\r\nlater, after I had become more familiar with title-bearing foreigners,\r\nTasistro again crossed my path in Washington, where he was acting as a\r\ntranslator in the State Department; but after a few years, owing to an\r\naffection of the eyes, he was obliged to give up this position, and his\r\ncondition was one of destitution. Through the instrumentality of my\r\nhusband he obtained an annuity from his son, whom, by the way, he never\r\nknew; and for some years, in a spirit of gratitude, taught my children\r\nFrench. His last literary effort was the translation of the first two\r\nvolumes of the Comte de Paris's \"History of the Civil War in America.\"\r\nHis devotion to my husband was pathetic, and I have frequently heard the\r\nCount say during the last years of his life that he never met him\r\nwithout some good fortune immediately following.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Gouverneur's death I received the following letter from\r\nTasistro, which is so beautiful in diction that I take pleasure in\r\ninserting it:\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON, April 26, 1880.\r\n\r\n     My dear Mrs. Gouverneur,\r\n\r\n     Had I obeyed implicitly the impulses of my heart, or been\r\n     less deeply affected by the great loss which will ever\r\n     render the 5th of April a day of sad & bitter memories to\r\n     me, I should perhaps have been more expeditious in rendering\r\n     to you the poor tribute of my condolence for the terrible\r\n     bereavement which it has pleased the Supreme Ruler of all\r\n     things to afflict you with.\r\n\r\n     My own particular grief in thus losing the best & most\r\n     valued friend I ever had on earth, receives additional\r\n     poignancy from the fact that, although duly impressed with\r\n     an abiding sense of the imperishable obligation, conferred\r\n     upon me by my lamented friend, I have been debarred, by my\r\n     own physical infirmities, from proffering those services\r\n     which it would have afforded me so much consolation to\r\n     perform.\r\n\r\n     I should be loath, however, to start on my own journey for\r\n     that shadowy land whose dim outlines are becoming daily more\r\n     & more visible to my mental eye, without leaving some kind\r\n     of record attesting to the depth of my appreciation of all\r\n     the noble attributes which clustered around your husband's\r\n     character--of my intense & lasting gratitude for his\r\n     generous exertions in my behalf, & my profound sympathy for\r\n     you personally in this hour of sorrow & affliction.\r\n\r\n     Hoping that you may find strength adequate to the emergency,\r\n     I remain, with great respect,\r\n\r\n          Your devoted servant,\r\n\r\n               L. F. TASISTRO.\r\n\r\nA valued friend of my father's was Dr. John W. Francis, the \"Doctor\r\nSangrado\" of this period, who, with other practitioners of the day,\r\nbelieved in curing all maladies by copious bleeding and a dose of\r\ncalomel. He was the fashionable physician of that time and especially\r\nprided himself upon his physical resemblance to Benjamin Franklin. He\r\nhad much dramatic ability of a comic sort, and I have often heard the\r\nopinion expressed that if he had adopted the stage as a profession he\r\nwould have rivalled the comedian William E. Burton, who at this time was\r\ndelighting his audiences at Burton's Theater on Chambers Street. In my\r\nearly life when Dr. Francis was called to our house professionally the\r\nfavorite dose he invariably prescribed for nearly every ailment was\r\n\"calomel and jalap.\"\r\n\r\nOne day during school hours at Miss Forbes's I was suddenly summoned to\r\nreturn to my home. I soon discovered after my arrival that I was in the\r\npresence of a tribunal composed of my parents and Dr. Francis. I was\r\ncompletely at a loss to understand why I was recalled with, what seemed\r\nto me, such undue haste, as I was entirely unconscious of any\r\nmisdemeanor. I soon discovered, however, that I was in great trouble. It\r\nseems that a young girl from Santa Cruz, a boarding pupil at our school,\r\nhad died of a malady known at this period as \"iliac passion,\" but now as\r\nappendicitis. Her attending physician was Dr. Ralph I. Bush, a former\r\nsurgeon in the British Navy, and I soon learned to my dismay that I was\r\naccused of having made an indiscreet remark in regard to his management\r\nof my schoolmate's case, although to this day I have never known exactly\r\nhow Dr. Francis, as our family physician, was involved in the affair. I\r\nstood up as bravely as I could under a rigid cross-examination, but,\r\nalas! I had no remembrance whatever of making any remark that could\r\npossibly offend. At any rate, Dr. Bush had given Dr. Francis to\r\nunderstand that he was ready to settle the affair according to the\r\napproved method of the day; but Dr. Francis was a man of peace, and had\r\nno relish for the code. Possibly, with the reputed activity of Sir\r\nLucius O'Trigger, Dr. Bush had already selected his seconds, as I have\r\nseldom seen a man more unnerved than Dr. Francis by what proved after\r\nall to be only a trifling episode. Soon after my trying interview,\r\nhowever, explanations followed, and the two physicians amicably adjusted\r\nthe affair.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this unfortunate entanglement arose from a\r\nmisunderstanding. There were two cases of illness at Miss Forbes's\r\nschool at the same time, the patient of Dr. Bush already mentioned and\r\nanother child suffering from a broken arm whom Dr. Francis attended. He\r\nset the limb but, as he was not proficient as a surgeon, the act was\r\ncriticized by the schoolgirls within my hearing. My sense of loyalty to\r\nmy family doctor caused me to utter some childish remark in his defense\r\nwhich was possibly to the effect that he was a great deal better doctor\r\nthan Dr. Bush, who had failed to save the life of our late schoolmate.\r\nIn recalling this childish episode which caused me so much anxiety I am\r\nsurprised that such unnecessary attention was paid to the passing remark\r\nof a mere child.\r\n\r\nDr. Francis was as proficient in quoting wise maxims as Benjamin\r\nFranklin, whom he was said to resemble. One of them which I recall is\r\nthe epitome of wisdom: \"If thy hand be in a lion's mouth, get it out as\r\nfast as thou canst.\"\r\n\r\nI may here state, by the way, that in close proximity to Dr. Francis's\r\nresidence on Bond Street lived Dr. Eleazer Parmly, the fashionable\r\ndentist of New York. He stood high in public esteem and a few still\r\nliving may remember his pleasing address. He accumulated a large fortune\r\nand I believe left many descendants.\r\n\r\nThe girls at Miss Forbes's school were taught needle work and\r\nembroidery, for in my early days no young woman's education was regarded\r\nas complete without these accomplishments. I quote from memory an\r\nelaborate sampler which bore the following poetical effusion:\r\n\r\n    What is the blooming tincture of the skin,\r\n    To peace of mind and harmony within?\r\n    What the bright sparkling of the finest eye\r\n    To the soft soothing of a kind reply?\r\n\r\n    Can comeliness of form or face so fair\r\n    With kindliness of word or deed compare?\r\n    No. Those at first the unwary heart may gain,\r\n    But these, these only, can the heart retain.\r\n\r\nIt seems remarkable that after spending months in working such effusive\r\nlines, or others similar to them, Miss Forbes's pupils did not become\r\nluminaries of virtue and propriety. If they did not their failure\r\ncertainly could not be laid at the door of their preceptress.\r\n\r\nMiss Forbes personally taught the rudiments but Mr. Luther Jackson, the\r\nwriting master, visited the school each day and instructed his scholars\r\nin the Italian style of chirography. Mr. Michael A. Gauvain taught\r\nFrench so successfully that in a short time many of us were able to\r\nplace on the amateur boards a number of French plays. Our audiences were\r\ncomposed chiefly of admiring parents, who naturally viewed the\r\nperformances with paternal partiality and no doubt regarded us as\r\nincipient Rachels. I remember as if it were only yesterday a play in\r\nwhich I took one of the principal parts--\"Athalie,\" one of Jean Racine's\r\nplays.\r\n\r\nThis mode of education was adopted in Paris by Madame Campan, the\r\ninstructor of the French nobility as well as of royalty during the First\r\nEmpire. In her manuscript memoirs, addressed to the children of her\r\nbrother, \"Citizen\" Edmond Charles Genet, who was then living in America,\r\nand of which I have an exact copy, she dwells upon the histrionic\r\nperformances by her pupils, among whom were Queen Hortense and my\r\nhusband's aunt, Eliza Monroe, daughter of President James Monroe and\r\nsubsequently the wife of Judge George Hay of Virginia. She gives a\r\ngraphic account of the Emperor attending one of these plays, when\r\n\"Esther,\" one of Racine's masterpieces, was performed.\r\n\r\nThe dancing master, who, of course, was an essential adjunct of every\r\nwell regulated school, was John J. Charraud. He was a refugee from Hayti\r\nafter the revolution in that island, and opened his dancing-school in\r\nNew York on Murray Street, but afterwards gave his \"publics\" in the City\r\nHall. He taught only the cotillion and the three-step waltz and came to\r\nour school three times a week for this purpose. Much attention was given\r\nto poetry, and I still recall the first piece I committed to memory,\r\n\"Pity the Sorrows of a Poor Old Man.\" My father thoroughly believed in\r\nmemorizing verse, and he always liberally rewarded me for every piece I\r\nwas able to recite. I may state, by the way, that Blair's Rhetoric was\r\na textbook of our school and the one which I most enjoyed.\r\n\r\nMiss Forbes had a number of medals which the girls were allowed to wear\r\nat stated periods for proficiency in their studies as well as for\r\nexemplary deportment. There was one of these which was known as the\r\n\"excellence medal,\" and the exultant pupil upon whom it was bestowed was\r\nallowed the privilege of wearing it for two weeks. Upon it was inscribed\r\nthe well known proverb of Solomon, \"Many daughters have done virtuously,\r\nbut thou excellest them all.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the pleasant memories of my early life are the dinners given by my\r\nfather, when the distinguished men of the day gathered around his\r\nhospitable board. In New York at this time all the professional cooks\r\nand waiters in their employ were colored men. Butlers were then unknown.\r\nIt was also before the days of _à la Russe_ service, and I remember\r\nseeing upon some of these occasions a saddle of venison, while at the\r\nopposite end of the table there was always a Westphalia ham. Fresh\r\nsalmon was considered a _pièce de résistance_. Many different wines were\r\nalways served, and long years later in a conversation with Gov. William\r\nL. Marcy, who was a warm friend of my father, he told me he was present\r\non one of these occasions when seven different varieties of wine were\r\nserved. I especially remember a dinner given by him in honor of Martin\r\nVan Buren. He was Vice-President of the United States at the time and\r\nwas accompanied to New York by John Forsyth of Georgia, a member of\r\nJackson's cabinet. Some of the guests invited to meet him were Gulian C.\r\nVerplanck, Thomas Morris, John C. Hamilton, Philip Hone and Walter\r\nBowne. The day previous to this dinner my father received the following\r\nnote from Mr. Van Buren:\r\n\r\n     My dear Sir,\r\n\r\n     Our friend Mr. Forsyth, is with me and you must send him an\r\n     invitation to dine with you to-morrow if, as I suppose is\r\n     the case, I am to have that honor.\r\n\r\n          Yours truly,\r\n\r\n               M. VAN BUREN.\r\n               Sunday, June 9, '33.\r\n\r\n     J. Campbell, Esq.\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren was a political friend of my father's from almost his\r\nearliest manhood. Two years after he was appointed Surrogate he received\r\nthe following confidential letter from Mr. Van Buren. As will be seen,\r\nit was before the days when he wrote in full the prefix \"Van\" to his\r\nname:\r\n\r\n     _Private._\r\n\r\n     My dear Sir,\r\n\r\n     Mr. Hoyt wishes me to quiet your apprehensions on the\r\n     subject of the Elector.[2] I will state to you truly how the\r\n     matter stands. My sincere belief is that we shall succeed;\r\n     at the same time I am bound to admit that the subject is\r\n     full of difficulties. If the members were now, and without\r\n     extraneous influence, to settle the matter, the result would\r\n     be certain. But I know that uncommon exertions have been,\r\n     and are making, by the outdoor friends of Adams & Clay to\r\n     effect a co-operation of their forces in favor of a divided\r\n     ticket. Look at the \"National Journal\" of the 23d, and you\r\n     will find an article, prepared with care, to make influence\r\n     there. A few months ago Mr. Adams would have revolted at\r\n     such a publication. It is the desperate situation of his\r\n     affairs that has brought him to it. The friends of Clay\r\n     (allowing Adams more strength than he may have), have no\r\n     hopes of getting him (Clay) into the house, unless they get\r\n     a part of this State. The certain decline of Adams in other\r\n     parts & the uncertainty of his strength in the east alarm\r\n     his friends on the same point. Thus both parties are led to\r\n     the adoption of desperate measures. Out of N. England Adams\r\n     has now no reason to expect more than his three or four\r\n     votes in Maryland. A partial discomfiture in the east may\r\n     therefore bring him below Mr. Clay's western votes, & if it\r\n     should appear that he (Adams) cannot get into the house, the\r\n     western votes would go to Crawford. If nothing takes place\r\n     materially to change the present state of things, we hope to\r\n     defeat their plans here. But if you lose your Assembly\r\n     ticket, there is no telling the effect it may produce, & my\r\n     chief object in being thus particular with you is to conjure\r\n     your utmost attention to that subject. About the Governor's\r\n     election there is no sort of doubt. I am not apt to be\r\n     confident, & _I aver that the matter is so._ But it is to\r\n     the Assembly that interested men look, and the difference of\r\n     ten members will (with the information the members can have\r\n     when they come to act) be decisive in the opinion of the\r\n     present members as to the complexion of the next house.\r\n     There are _other points of view_ which I cannot now state to\r\n     you, in which the result I speak of may seriously affect the\r\n     main question. Let me therefore entreat your serious\r\n     attention to this matter. _Be careful of this._ Your city is\r\n     a gossiping place, & what you tell to one man in confidence\r\n     is soon in the mouths of hundreds. You can impress our\r\n     friends on this subject without connecting me with it. Do\r\n     so.\r\n\r\n          Your sincere friend,\r\n\r\n               M. V. BUREN.\r\n               Albany, Octob. 28, 1824.\r\n\r\n     James Campbell, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe Mr. Hoyt referred to in the opening sentence of this letter was\r\nJesse Hoyt, another political friend of my father's who, under Van\r\nBuren's administration, was Collector of the Port of New York. During my\r\nchild life on Long Island he made my father occasional visits, and in\r\nsubsequent years lived opposite us on Hubert Street. He was the first\r\none to furnish me with a practical illustration of man's perfidy. As a\r\nvery young child I consented to have my ears pierced, when Mr. Hoyt\r\nvolunteered to send me a pair of coral ear-rings, but he failed to carry\r\nout his promise. I remember reading some years ago several letters\r\naddressed to Hoyt by \"Prince\" John Van Buren which he begins with \"Dear\r\nJessica.\"\r\n\r\nTable appointments at this time were most simple and unostentatious.\r\nWine coolers were found in every well regulated house, but floral\r\ndecorations were seldom seen. At my father's dinners, given upon special\r\noccasions, the handsome old silver was always used, much of which\r\nformerly belonged to my mother's family. The forks and spoons were of\r\nheavy beaten silver, and the knives were made of steel and had ivory\r\nhandles. Ice cream was always the dessert, served in tall pyramids, and\r\nthe universal flavor was vanilla taken directly from the bean, as\r\nprepared extracts were then unknown. I have no recollection of seeing\r\nice water served upon any well-appointed table, as modern facilities for\r\nkeeping it had yet to appear, and cold water could always be procured\r\nfrom pumps on the premises. The castors, now almost obsolete, containing\r\nthe usual condiments, were _de rigueur_; while the linen used in our\r\nhome was imported from Ireland, and in some cases bore the coat of arms\r\nof the United States with its motto, \"_E Pluribus Unum_.\" My father's\r\ntable accommodated twenty persons and the dinner hour was three o'clock.\r\nThese social functions frequently lasted a number of hours, and when it\r\nbecame necessary the table was lighted by lamps containing sperm oil and\r\ncandles in candelabra. These were the days when men wore ruffled shirt\r\nfronts and high boots.\r\n\r\nI still have in my possession an acceptance from William B. Astor, son\r\nof John Jacob Astor, to a dinner given by my father, written upon very\r\nsmall note paper and folded in the usual style of the day:\r\n\r\n     Mr. W. Astor will do himself the honor to dine with Mr.\r\n     Campbell to-day agreeable to his polite invitation.\r\n\r\n     May 28th.\r\n\r\n     James Campbell Esq.\r\n          Hubert Street.\r\n\r\nI well remember a stag dinner given by my father when I was a child at\r\nwhich one of the guests was Philip Hone, one of the most efficient and\r\nenergetic Mayors the City of New York has ever had. He is best known\r\nto-day by his remarkable diary, edited by Bayard Tuckerman, which is a\r\nveritable storehouse of events relating to the contemporary history of\r\nthe city. Mr. Hone had a fine presence with much elegance of manner, and\r\nwas truly one of nature's noblemen. Many years ago Arent Schuyler de\r\nPeyster, to whom I am indebted for many traditions of early New York\r\nsociety, told me that upon one occasion a conversation occurred between\r\nPhilip Hone and his brother John, a successful auctioneer, in which the\r\nlatter advocated their adoption of a coat of arms. Philip's response was\r\ncharacteristic of the man: \"I will have no arms except those Almighty\r\nGod has given me.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection, and _àpropos_ of heraldic designs and their\r\naccompaniments, I have been informed that the Hon. Daniel Manning,\r\nCleveland's Secretary of the Treasury, used upon certain of his cards of\r\ninvitation a crest with the motto, \"Aquila non capit muscas\" (\"The eagle\r\ndoes not catch flies\"). This brings to my mind the following anecdote\r\nfrom a dictionary of quotations translated into English in 1826 by D. N.\r\nMcDonnel: \"Casti, an Italian poet who fled from Russia on account of\r\nhaving written a scurrilous poem in which he made severe animadversions\r\non the Czarina and some of her favorites, took refuge in Austria. Joseph\r\nII. upon coming in contact with him asked him whether he was not afraid\r\nof being punished there, as well as in Russia, for having insulted his\r\nhigh friend and ally. The bard's steady reply was 'Aquila non capit\r\nmuscas.'\" Sir Francis Bacon, however, was the first in the race, as long\r\nbefore either Manning or Casti were born he made use of these exact\r\nwords in his \"Jurisdiction of the Marshes.\"\r\n\r\nIn my early days John H. Contoit kept an ice cream garden on Broadway\r\nnear White Street, and it was the first establishment of this kind, as\r\nfar as I know, in New York. During the summer months it was a favorite\r\nresort for many who sought a cool place and pleasant society, where they\r\nmight eat ice cream under shady vines and ornamental lattice work. The\r\nice cream was served in high glasses, and the price paid for it was\r\ntwelve and one-half cents. Nickles and dimes were of course unknown, but\r\nthe Mexican shilling, equivalent to twelve and one-half cents, and the\r\nquarter of a dollar, also Mexican, were in circulation.\r\n\r\nThere were no such places as lunchrooms and tearooms in my early days,\r\nand the only restaurant of respectability was George W. Browne's \"eating\r\nhouse,\" which was largely frequented by New Yorkers. The proprietor had\r\na very pretty daughter, Mrs. Coles, who was brought prominently before\r\nthe public in the summer of 1841 as the heroine of an altercation\r\nbetween August Belmont and Edward Heyward, a prominent South Carolinian,\r\nfollowed by a duel in Maryland in which Belmont is said to have been so\r\nseriously wounded as to retain the scars until his death.\r\n\r\nAlexander T. Stewart's store, corner of Broadway and Chambers Street,\r\nwas the fashionable dry goods emporium, and for many years was without a\r\nconspicuous rival. William I. Tenney, Horace Hinsdale, Henry Gelston,\r\nand Frederick and Henry G. Marquand were jewelers. Tenney's store was on\r\nBroadway near Murray Street; Gelston's was under the Astor House on the\r\ncorner of Barclay Street and Broadway; Hinsdale's was on the east side\r\nof Broadway and Cortlandt Street; and the Marquands were on the west\r\nside of Broadway between Cortlandt and Dey Streets.\r\n\r\nJames Leary bore the palm in New York as the fashionable hatter, and his\r\nshop was on Broadway under the Astor House. As was usual then with his\r\ncraft, he kept individual blocks for those of his customers who had\r\nheads of unusual dimensions. In his show window he sometimes exhibited a\r\nblock of remarkable size which was adapted to fit the heads of a\r\ndistinguished trio, Daniel Webster, General James Watson Webb, and\r\nCharles Augustus Davis. Miss Anna Leary of Newport, his daughter and a\r\ndevout Roman Catholic, received the title of Countess from the Pope.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent hostelry in New York before the days of the Astor\r\nHouse was the City Hotel on lower Broadway. I have been informed that\r\nthe site upon which it stood still belongs to representatives of the\r\nBoreel family, descendants of the first John Jacob Astor. Another, but\r\nof a later period, was the American Hotel on Broadway near the Astor\r\nHouse. It was originally the town house of John C. Vanden Heuvel, a\r\nmember of one of New York's most exclusive families. Upon Mr. Vanden\r\nHeuvel's death this house passed into the possession of his son-in-law,\r\nJohn C. Hamilton, who changed it into a hotel. Its proprietor was\r\nWilliam B. Cozzens, who was so long and favorably known as a hotel\r\nproprietor. At this same time he had charge of the only hotel at West\r\nPoint, and it was named after him. If any army officers survive who were\r\ncadets during Cozzens's _régime_ they will recall with pleasure his\r\nkindly bearing and attractive manner. Mr. Vanden Heuvel's country\r\nresidence was in the vicinity of Ninetieth Street overlooking the Hudson\r\nRiver. His other daughters were Susan Annette, who married Mr. Thomas S.\r\nGibbes of South Carolina, and Justine, who became the wife of Gouverneur\r\nS. Bibby, a cousin of my husband.\r\n\r\nAs I first remember Union Square it was in the outskirts of the city.\r\nSeveral handsome houses had a few years previously been erected there by\r\nJames F. Penniman, the son-in-law of Mr. Samuel Judd, the latter of whom\r\namassed a large fortune by the manufacture and sale of oil and candles.\r\nMiss Lydia Kane, a sister of the elder De Lancey Kane and a noted wit of\r\nthe day, upon a certain occasion was showing some strangers the sights\r\nof New York, and in passing these houses was asked by whom they were\r\noccupied. \"That one,\" she responded, indicating the one in which the\r\nPennimans themselves lived, \"is occupied by one of the _illuminati_ of\r\nthe city.\"\r\n\r\nRobert L. Stuart and his brother Alexander were proprietors of a large\r\ncandy store on the corner of Chambers and Greenwich Streets, under the\r\nfirm name of R. L. & A. Stuart. Their establishment was a favorite\r\nresort of the children of the day, who were as much addicted to sweets\r\nas are their more recent successors. \"Broken candy\" was a specialty of\r\nthis firm, and was sold at a very low price. Alexander Stuart frequently\r\nwaited upon customers, and as a child I have often chattered with him\r\nover the counter. He never married.\r\n\r\nThe principal markets were Washington on the North River, and Fulton on\r\nthe east side. The marketing was always done by the mistress of each\r\nhouse accompanied by a servant bearing a large basket. During the season\r\nsmall girls carried strawberries from door to door, calling out as they\r\nwent along; and during the summer months hot corn, carried in closed\r\nreceptacles made for the purpose, was sold by colored men, whose cries\r\ncould be heard in every part of the city.\r\n\r\nMrs. Isaac Sayre's bakery was an important shop for all housewives, and\r\nher homemade jumbles and pound cake were in great demand. Her plum cake,\r\ntoo, was exceptionally good, and it is an interesting fact that it was\r\nshe who introduced cake in boxes for weddings. Her shop survived for an\r\nextraordinary number of years and, as far as I know, may still exist and\r\nbe kept by some of her descendants.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to speak of a peculiar custom which in this day of\r\ngrace, when there are no longer any old women, seems rather odd. A\r\nwoman immediately after her marriage wore a cap made of some light\r\nmaterial, which she invariably tied with strings under her chin. Most\r\nolder women were horrified at the thought of gray hairs, and immediately\r\nfollowing their appearance false fronts were purchased, over which caps\r\nwere worn. I well recall that some of the most prominent women of the\r\nday concealed fine heads of hair in this grotesque fashion. Baldheaded\r\nmen were not tolerated, and \"scratches\" or wigs provided the remedy.\r\nMarriage announcements were decidedly informal. When the proper time\r\narrived for the world to be taken into the confidence of a young couple,\r\nthey walked upon Broadway arm in arm, thus announcing that their\r\nmarriage was imminent.\r\n\r\nA dinner given in my young days by my parents to Mr. and Mrs. William C.\r\nRives still lingers in my memory. Mr. Rives had just been appointed to\r\nhis second mission to France, and with his wife was upon the eve of\r\nsailing for his new post of duty. I remember that it was a large\r\nentertainment, but the only guests whom I recall in addition to the\r\nguests of honor were Mr. and Mrs. James A. Hamilton. He was a son of\r\nAlexander Hamilton, and was at the time United States District Attorney\r\nin New York. It seems strange, indeed, that the other guests should have\r\nescaped my memory, but a head-dress worn by Mrs. Hamilton struck my\r\nyoung fancy and I have never forgotten it. As I recall that occasion I\r\ncan see her handsome face surmounted by a huge fluffy pink cap. This Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Hamilton were the parents of Alexander Hamilton, the third, who\r\nmarried Angelica, daughter of Maturin Livingston, and who, by the way,\r\nas I remember, was one of the most graceful dancers and noted belles of\r\nher day.\r\n\r\nThomas Morris, son of Robert Morris the great financier of the\r\nRevolution, was my father's life-long friend. He was an able\r\n_raconteur_, and I recall many conversations relating to his early\r\nlife, a portion of which had been spent in Paris at its celebrated\r\nPolytechnic School. One incident connected with his career is especially\r\ninteresting. When the sordid Louis Philippe, then the Duke of Orleans,\r\nwas wandering in this country, teaching in his native tongue \"the young\r\nidea how to shoot,\" he was the guest for a time of Mr. Morris. Several\r\nyears later when John Greig, a Scotchman and prominent citizen of\r\nCanandaigua, New York, was about to sail for France, Mr. Morris gave him\r\na letter of introduction to the Duke. Upon his arrival in Havre after a\r\nlengthy voyage he found much to his surprise that Louis Philippe was\r\ncomfortably seated upon the throne of France. Under these altered\r\nconditions he hesitated to present his letter, but after mature\r\nconsideration sought an audience with the new King; and it is a pleasing\r\ncommentary upon human nature to add that he was welcomed with open arms.\r\nThe King had by no means forgotten the hospitality he had received in\r\nAmerica, and especially the many favors extended by the Morris family.\r\nMr. Morris's wife was Miss Sarah Kane, daughter of Colonel John Kane,\r\nand she was beautiful even in her declining years. She also possessed\r\nthe wit so characteristic of the Kanes, who, by the way, were of Celtic\r\norigin, being descended from John Kane who came from Ireland in 1752.\r\nShe was the aunt of the first De Lancey Kane, who married the pretty\r\nLouisa Langdon, the granddaughter of John Jacob Astor. Their daughter,\r\nEmily Morris, made frequent visits to our house. She was renowned for\r\nboth beauty and wit. I remember seeing several verses addressed to her,\r\nthe only lines of which I recall are as follows:\r\n\r\n    That calm collected look,\r\n    As though her pulses beat by book.\r\n\r\nAnother intimate friend of my father was Frederick de Peyster, who at a\r\nlater day became President of the New York Historical Society. He\r\nhabitually took Sunday tea with us, and always received a warm welcome\r\nfrom the juvenile members of the family with whom he was a great\r\nfavorite. He was devoted to children, and delighted our young hearts by\r\noccasional presents of game-chickens which at once became family pets.\r\n\r\nIn 1823 and 1824 my father's sympathies were deeply enlisted in behalf\r\nof the Greeks in their struggles for independence from the Turkish rule.\r\nIt will be remembered that this was the cause to which Byron devoted his\r\nlast energies. The public sentiment of the whole country was aroused to\r\na high pitch of excitement, and meetings were held not only for the\r\npurpose of lending moral support and encouragement to the Greeks, but\r\nalso for raising funds for their assistance. Among those to whom my\r\nfather appealed was his friend, Rudolph Bunner, a highly prominent\r\ncitizen of Oswego, N.Y. Although a lawyer he did not practice his\r\nprofession, but devoted himself chiefly to his extensive landed estates\r\nin Oswego county. He was wealthy and generous, a good liver and an\r\neloquent political speaker. He served one term in Congress where, as\r\nelsewhere, he was regarded as a man of decided ability. He died about\r\n1833 at the age of nearly seventy. The distinguished New York lawyer,\r\nJohn Duer, married his daughter Anne, by whom he had thirteen children,\r\none of whom, Anna Henrietta, married the late Pierre Paris Irving, a\r\nnephew of Washington Irving and at one time rector of the Episcopal\r\nchurch at New Brighton, Staten Island. Mr. Bunner's letter in response\r\nto my father's appeal is not devoid of interest, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n     OSWEGO, 12 Jan'y 1824.\r\n\r\n     My dear Sir,\r\n\r\n     Though I have not written to you yet you were not so soon\r\n     forgotten. Nor can you so easily be erased from my memory as\r\n     my negligence might seem to imply. In truth few persons\r\n     have impressed my mind with a deeper sentiment of respect\r\n     than yourself; you have that of open and frank in your\r\n     character which if not in my own, is yet so congenial to my\r\n     feelings that I shall much regret if my habitual indolence\r\n     can lose me such a friend. Your request in favor of the\r\n     Greeks will be hard to comply with. If I can be a\r\n     contributor in a humble way to their success by my exertions\r\n     here they shall not want them, but I fear the _angusta res\r\n     domi_ may press too heavily upon us to permit of an\r\n     effectual benevolence. If you wanted five hundred men six\r\n     feet high with sinewy arms and case hardened constitutions,\r\n     bold spirits and daring adventurers who would travel upon a\r\n     bushel of corn and a gallon of whiskey per man from the\r\n     extreme point of the world to Constantinople we could\r\n     furnish you with them, but I doubt whether they could raise\r\n     the money to pay their passage from the gut of Gibraltar\r\n     upwards. The effort however shall be made and if we can not\r\n     shew ourselves rich we will at least manifest our good will.\r\n     Though Greece touches few Yankee settlers thro the medium of\r\n     classical associations yet a people struggling to free\r\n     themselves from foreign bondage is sure to find warm hearts\r\n     in every native of the wilderness. We admire your noble\r\n     efforts and if we do not imitate you it is because our\r\n     purses are as empty as a Boetian's skull is thick. We know\r\n     so little of what is _really_ projecting in the cabinets of\r\n     Europe that we are obliged to believe implicitly in\r\n     newspaper reports, and we are perhaps foolish in hoping that\r\n     the Holy Alliance intends to take the Spanish part of the\r\n     New World under their protection. In such an event our\r\n     backwoodsmen would spring with the activity of squirrels to\r\n     the assistance of the regenerated Spaniards and perhaps\r\n     _there_ we might fight more effectually the battle for\r\n     universal Freedom than either at Thermopylæ or Marathon.\r\n     There indeed we might strike a blow that would break up the\r\n     deep foundations of despotic power so as that neither art or\r\n     force could again collect and cement the scattered elements.\r\n     We are too distant from Greece to make the Turks feel our\r\n     physical strength and what we can do thro money and\r\n     sympathy is little in comparison with what we could if they\r\n     were so near as that we might in addition pour out the tide\r\n     of an armed northern population to sweep their shores and\r\n     overcome the tyrants like one of their pestilential winds.\r\n     Nevertheless, sympathy is a wonderful power and the sympathy\r\n     of a free nation like our own will not lose its moral\r\n     effect. I calculate strongly on this. It is a more refined\r\n     and rational kind of chivalry--this interest and activity in\r\n     the fate of nations struggling to break the oppressor's rod,\r\n     and it should be encouraged even where it is not directed so\r\n     as to give it all adequate force. They who would chill it,\r\n     who would reason about the why and the wherefore ought to\r\n     recollect that such things can not be called forth by the\r\n     art of man--they must burst spontaneously from his nature\r\n     and be directed by his wisdom for the benefit of his\r\n     kind.... We are all here real Radical Democrats and though\r\n     some of us came in at the eleventh hour we will not go back,\r\n     but on--on--on though certain of missing the penny fee. In\r\n     truth this is the difference between real conviction and the\r\n     calculating policy which takes sides according to what it\r\n     conceives the vantage ground. A converted politician is as\r\n     obstinate in his belief as one born in the faith. The man of\r\n     craft changes his position according to the varying aspect\r\n     of the political heavens. The one plays a game--the other\r\n     sees as much of reality (or thinks he sees) in politicks as\r\n     he does in his domestic affairs and is as earnest in the one\r\n     as the other.\r\n\r\n          Salve--[Greek: Kai Chaire]\r\n\r\n               R. BUNNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     8 o'clock.\r\n\r\n     I have had a full meeting for your Greeks--and found my men\r\n     of more mettle than I hoped for. We will do something thro\r\n     the _Country_--We have set the Parsons to work and one\r\n     shilling a head will make a good donation. We think we can\r\n     give you 4 or 5 hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nMr. Bunner was over sixty years old when he went to live in Oswego, but\r\nhe soon became identified with the interests of the place and added much\r\nby his activities to its local renown. In an undated letter to my\r\nfather, he thus expatiates upon his situation in his adopted home, and\r\npaints its advantages in no uncertain colors:--\r\n\r\n     I am here unquestionably an exile but I will never dispond\r\n     at my fate nor whimper because my own folly, want of tact or\r\n     the very malice of the times have placed me in Patmos when I\r\n     desire a more splendid theatre. I can here be useful to my\r\n     family--to my district. I can live cheaply, increase my\r\n     fortune, be upon a par with the best of my neighbors, which\r\n     I prefer to the feasts of your ostentatious mayor or the\r\n     more real luxury of Phil Brasher's Table. Our population is\r\n     small, our society contracted, but we are growing rapidly in\r\n     numbers; and the society we have is in my opinion and to my\r\n     taste fully equal to anything in your home. We possess men\r\n     of intelligence without pretention, active men as Jacob\r\n     Barker without his roguery--men whom nature intended to\r\n     flourish at St. James, but whose fate fortune in some fit of\r\n     prolifick humor fixed and nailed to this Sinope. We have\r\n     however to mitigate the cold spring breezes of the lake a\r\n     fall unrivalled in mildness and in beauty even in Italy, the\r\n     land of poetry and passion. We have a whole lake in front,\r\n     whose clear blue waters are without a parallel in Europe. We\r\n     have a beautiful river brawling at our feet, the banks of\r\n     which gently slope and when our village is filled I will\r\n     venture to say that in point of beauty, health and variety\r\n     of prospect it has _nil simile aut secundum_.\r\n\r\nOur house was the rendezvous of many of the learned and literary men of\r\nthe day, who would sit for hours in the library discussing congenial\r\ntopics. Among others I well recall the celebrated jurist, Ogden Hoffman.\r\nHe had an exceptionally melodious voice, and I have often heard him\r\ncalled \"the silver-tongued orator.\" It has been asserted that in\r\ncriminal cases a jury was rarely known to withstand his appeal. He\r\nmarried for his second wife Virginia E. Southard, a daughter of Judge\r\nSamuel L. Southard of New Jersey, who throughout Monroe's two\r\nadministrations was Secretary of War. In the \"Wealthy Citizens of New\r\nYork,\" edited in 1845 by Moses Y. Beach, an early owner in part of _The\r\nNew York Sun_, the Hoffman family is thus described: \"Few families, for\r\nso few a number of persons as compose it, have cut 'a larger swath' or\r\n'bigger figure' in the way of posts and preferment. Talent, and also\r\npublic service rendered, martial gallantry, poetry, judicial acumen,\r\noratory, all have their lustre mingled with this name.\" I regard this\r\nstatement as just and truthful.\r\n\r\nStill another valued associate of my father was Hugh Maxwell, a\r\nprominent member of the New York bar. In his earlier life he was\r\nDistrict Attorney and later Collector of the Port of New York. The\r\nMaxwells owned a pleasant summer residence at Nyack-on-the-Hudson, where\r\nwe as children made occasional visits. Many years later one of my\r\ndaughters formed an intimate friendship with Hugh Maxwell's\r\ngranddaughter, Virginia De Lancey Kearny, subsequently Mrs. Ridgely\r\nHunt, which terminated only with the latter's death in 1897.\r\n\r\nFrom my earliest childhood Gulian C. Verplanck was a frequent guest at\r\nour house. He and my father formed an intimacy in early manhood which\r\nlasted throughout life. Mr. Verplanck was graduated from Columbia\r\nCollege in 1801, the youngest Bachelor of Arts who, up to that time, had\r\nreceived a diploma from that institution of learning. Both he and my\r\nfather found in politics an all-absorbing topic of conversation,\r\nespecially as both of them took an active part in state affairs. I have\r\nmany letters, one of them written as early as 1822, from Mr. Verplanck\r\nto my father bearing upon political matters in New York. For four terms\r\nhe represented his district in Congress, while later he served in the\r\nState Senate and for many years was Vice Chancellor of the University of\r\nthe State of New York. He was an ardent Episcopalian and a vestryman in\r\nold Trinity Parish. He was a brilliant conversationalist, and his\r\ntastes, like my father's, were decidedly literary. In connection with\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant and Robert C. Sands, he edited _The Talisman_, an\r\nannual which continued through the year 1827. Mr. Verplanck lived to an\r\nold age and survived my father for a long time, but he did not forget\r\nhis old friend. Almost a score of years after my father's death, on the\r\n4th of July, 1867, Mr. Verplanck delivered a scholarly oration before\r\nthe Tammany Society of New York, in which he paid the following glowing\r\ntribute to his memory:\r\n\r\n     In those days James Campbell, for many years the Surrogate\r\n     of this city, was a powerful leader at Tammany Hall, and\r\n     from character and mind alone, without any effort or any act\r\n     of popularity. He was not college-bred, but he was the son\r\n     of a learned father, old Malcolm Campbell, who had been\r\n     trained at Aberdeen, the great school of Scotch Latinity.\r\n     James Campbell was, like his father, a good classical\r\n     scholar, and he was a sound lawyer. He was not only an\r\n     assiduous, a kind, sound and just magistrate, but one of\r\n     unquestioned ability. In his days of Surrogateship, the days\r\n     of universal reporting, either in the multitudinous volumes\r\n     in white law bindings on the shelves of lawyers, or in the\r\n     crowded columns of the daily papers, had not quite arrived\r\n     though they were just at hand. Had he lived and held office\r\n     a few years later, I do not doubt that he would have ranked\r\n     with the great luminaries of legal science. As it is, I fear\r\n     that James Campbell's reputation must share the fate of the\r\n     reputations of many able and eminent men in all professions\r\n     who can not\r\n\r\n                        Look to Time's award,\r\n    Feeble tradition is their memory's guard.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent newspaper in New York in my early days was the\r\n_Courier and Enquirer_, edited by General James Watson Webb, a man of\r\ndistinguished ability. He began his literary career by editing the\r\n_Morning Courier_, but as this was not a very successful venture he\r\npurchased the _New York Enquirer_ from Mordecai Manasseh Noah, and in\r\n1829 merged the two papers. Several leading journalists began their\r\nactive careers in his office, among others James Gordon Bennett,\r\nsubsequently editor of _The New York Herald_, Henry J. Raymond, the\r\nfounder of _The New York Times_, and Charles King, father of Madam Kate\r\nKing Waddington and Mrs. Eugene Schuyler, who at one time edited _The\r\nAmerican_ and subsequently became the honored president of Columbia\r\nCollege. James Reed Spaulding, a New Englander by birth, was also\r\nconnected with the _Courier and Enquirer_ for about ten years. In 1860\r\nhe became a member of the staff of the New York _World_, which, by the\r\nway, was originally intended to be a semi-religious sheet. During\r\nPresident Lincoln's administration General Webb sold the _Courier and\r\nEnquirer_ to the _World_, and the two papers were consolidated. William\r\nSeward Webb of New York was a son of this General Webb, and the latter's\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Catharine Louisa Benton, the widow of Colonel James G.\r\nBenton of the army, lived until recently in Washington, and is one of\r\nthe pleasant reminders left me of the old days of my New York life.\r\n\r\n_The New York Herald_ was established some years after the _Courier and\r\nEnquirer_ and was from the first a flourishing sheet. It was\r\nexceptionally spicy, and it dealt so much in personalities that my\r\nfather, who was a gentleman of the old school with very conservative\r\nviews, was not, to say the least, one of its strongest admirers. Several\r\nyears before the Civil War, at a time when the anti-slavery cauldron was\r\nat its boiling point, its editor, the elder James Gordon Bennett,\r\ndubbed its three journalistic contemporaries in New York, the World, the\r\nFlesh, and the Devil--the _World_, representing human life with all its\r\npomps and vanities; the _Times_, as a sheet as vacillating as the flesh;\r\nand the _Tribune_, as the virulent champion of abolition, the\r\ncounterpart of the Devil himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1842 James Gordon Bennett took his bride, who was\r\nMiss Henrietta Agnes Crean of New York, to Washington on their wedding\r\njourney. As this season had been unusually severe, great distress\r\nprevailed, and a number of society women organized a charity ball for\r\nthe relief of the destitute. It was given under the patronage of Mrs.\r\nMadison (the ex-President's widow), Mrs. Samuel L. Gouverneur (my\r\nhusband's mother), Mrs. Benjamin Ogle Tayloe (Julia Maria Dickinson of\r\nTroy, New York), and other society matrons, and, as can readily be\r\nunderstood, was a financial as well as a social success. Tickets were\r\neagerly sought, and Mr. Bennett applied for them for his wife and\r\nhimself. At first he was refused, but after further consideration Mrs.\r\nMadison and Mrs. Gouverneur of the committee upon invitations granted\r\nhis request on condition that no mention of the ball should appear in\r\nthe columns of the _Herald_. Mr. Bennett and his wife accordingly\r\nattended the entertainment, where the latter was much admired and danced\r\nto her heart's content. Two days later, however, much to the chagrin and\r\nindignation of the managers, an extended account of the ball appeared in\r\nthe _Herald_. This incident will be better appreciated when I state that\r\nat this time the personal mention of a woman in a newspaper was an\r\nunheard-of liberty. It was the old-fashioned idea that a woman's name\r\nshould occur but twice in print, first upon the occasion of her marriage\r\nand subsequently upon the announcement of her death. My husband once\r\nremarked to me, upon reading a description of a dress worn by one of my\r\ndaughters at a ball, that if such a notice had appeared in a newspaper\r\nin connection with his sister he or his father would have thrashed the\r\neditor.\r\n\r\nJohn L. O'Sullivan, a prominent literary man and in subsequent years\r\nminister to Portugal, edited a periodical called the _Democratic\r\nReview_, which was published in magazine form. I well recall the first\r\nappearance of _Harper's Magazine_ in June, 1850, and that for some time\r\nit had but few illustrations. _The Evening_ Post was established in\r\n1801, many years prior to the _Courier and Enquirer_. It was always\r\nwidely read, was democratic in its tone, and its editorials were highly\r\nregarded. While I lived in New York, and also much later, it was edited\r\nby William Cullen Bryant, who was as gifted as an editor as he was as a\r\npoet. I have before me now a reprint of the first issue of this paper,\r\ndated Monday, November 16, 1801. I copy some of the advertisements, as\r\nmany old New York names are represented:\r\n\r\n            FOR SALE BY HOFFMAN & SETON\r\n\r\n     Twelve hhds. assorted Glass Ware.\r\n     2 boxes Listadoes,\r\n     1 trunk white Kid Gloves,\r\n     200 boxes Soap & Candles,\r\n     60 bales Cinnamon, entitled to drawback.\r\n     Nov. 16.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    FREIGHT\r\n\r\n     For Copenhagen or Hamburgh,\r\n     The bark BERKKESKOW, Capt.\r\n     Gubriel Tothammer, is ready to receive\r\n     freight for either of the above places, if application\r\n     is made to the Captain on board, at Gouverneur's\r\n     Wharf.\r\n\r\n                GOUVERNEUR & KEMBLE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    FOR SALE\r\n\r\n     Gin in pipes; large and small green Bottle\r\n     Cases, complete; Glass Ware, consisting of\r\n     Tumblers, Decanters, &c.; Hair Brushes, long and\r\n     short; black and blue Dutch Cloth; Flour, by\r\n\r\n                FREDERICK DE PEYSTER.\r\n\r\n     A STORE HOUSE in Broad-street to let, apply\r\n     as above.

After several years spent at Miss\r\nForbes's my parents decided to afford me greater advantages for study,\r\nand especially for becoming more proficient in the French language, and\r\nI was accordingly sent to Madame Eloise Chegaray's institution, which\r\nfor many years was regarded as the most prominent girls' school in the\r\ncountry. It was a large establishment located on the corner of Houston\r\nand Mulberry Streets, where she accommodated boarding pupils as well as\r\nday scholars. Many years later this building was sold to the religious\r\norder of the _Sacre Coeur_. The school hours were from nine until three,\r\nwith an intermission at twelve o'clock. The vacation, as at Miss\r\nForbes's, was limited to the month of August. The discipline was not so\r\nrigid as at Miss Forbes's, as Madame Chegaray, who, by the way, taught\r\nher pupils to address her as _Tante_, governed almost entirely by\r\naffection. She possessed unusual grace of manner and great kindness of\r\nheart, and her few surviving pupils hold her name and memory in the\r\nhighest esteem. Her early history is of exceptional interest. She was a\r\ndaughter of Pierre Prosper Désabaye, and came with her father and the\r\nother members of his family from Paris to New York on account of his\r\nstraitened circumstances, caused by an insurrection in San Domingo,\r\nwhere his family owned large estates. Madame Chegaray commenced as a\r\nmere girl to teach French in a school in New Brunswick, New Jersey, kept\r\nby Miss Sophie Hay, and was retained on account of the extreme purity of\r\nher accent.\r\n\r\nI chance to have in my possession Madame Chegaray's own account of her\r\nearly struggles after leaving Miss Hay, from which I take great pleasure\r\nin quoting:\r\n\r\n     Among the royal _émigrés_ to this country was the Countess\r\n     de St. Memin who kept a school. As my brother Marc had\r\n     removed to New York we joined him and I was employed as\r\n     French governess in the school of Mademoiselle de St. Memin.\r\n     But I still knew nothing but to speak my own native tongue.\r\n     One day I was bewailing my ignorance in the presence of M.\r\n     Felix de Beaujour, Consul General of France to this country.\r\n\r\n     \"Mlle. Eloise,\" he said, \"quand on sait lire on peut\r\n     toujours s'istruire.\"\r\n\r\n     This gave me a new thought. I set seriously about studying.\r\n     I took classes. What I was to teach on the morrow I studied\r\n     the night before. I worked early and late. With the return\r\n     of Louis Philippe the St. Memins returned to France and I\r\n     became a teacher in the school of Madame Nau. Here I studied\r\n     and taught. On me fell all the burden of the school while\r\n     Madame Nau amused herself with harp and piano. For this I\r\n     had only $150 a year. To further assist my family I knit\r\n     woolen jackets. They were a great deal of trouble to me and\r\n     I was very grateful to Madame Isaac Iselin, the mother of\r\n     Mr. Adrain Iselin, who always found purchasers to give me\r\n     excellent prices. Ah, I was young then. I thought that I\r\n     earned that money. Now I know that it was only her delicate\r\n     manner of doing me a service. Madame Iselin bought my\r\n     jackets and then gave them away.\r\n\r\n     Feeling that I was worth much to Madame Nau, and that I must\r\n     do more to relieve my brother Marc, my brother Gustave\r\n     having gone to sea with Captain de Peyster, I begged Madame\r\n     Nau to give me $250. This she refused. Her reply, \"Me navra\r\n     le coeur,\" overwhelmed me. It was Saturday. I started home\r\n     in great distress and met on the way the dear admirable Miss\r\n     Sophy Hay to whom I told my sorrow.\r\n\r\n     \"Miss Hay,\" I exclaimed, \"I will open a school for myself.\"\r\n     She tapped me on the forehead. \"Do, dear Eloise, and God\r\n     will help you.\"\r\n\r\n     How all difficulties were smoothed away! The dear Madame\r\n     Iselin took charge of all my purchases, advancing the money.\r\n     They were very simple, those splint chairs and carpets and\r\n     tables, for we were simpler-minded then. On the 1st of May\r\n     1814 I opened my school on Greenwich Street with sixteen\r\n     pupils. Good M. Roulet gave me his two wards. I received\r\n     several scholars from a convent just closed and I had my\r\n     nieces Améline and Laura Bérault de St. Maurice and Clara\r\n     the daughter of Marc [Désabaye], who afterward married Ponty\r\n     Lemoine, the lawyer in whose office Charles O'Conor studied.\r\n     Thus was my school started, and I take this occasion to\r\n     express my gratitude to those who confided in so young an\r\n     instructress--for I was only twenty-two--the education of\r\n     their daughters, and I pray God to bless them and their\r\n     country....\r\n\r\nMany well-known women were educated at this school, and one of the first\r\npupils was Miss Sarah Morris, the granddaughter of Lewis Morris, the\r\nSigner, and the mother of the senior Mrs. Hamilton Fish. A younger\r\nsister of Mrs. Fish, Christine, who many years later was a pupil of\r\nMadame Chegaray, and who is now Mrs. William Preston Griffin of New\r\nYork, ministered to Madame Chegaray in her last illness, and told me\r\nthat her parting words to her were, \"_Adieu, chère Christine, fidèle\r\namie._\" In spite of her extreme youth Madame Chegaray took an\r\nexceptionally serious view of life, even refusing to wear flowers in her\r\nbonnets or to sing, although she had a very sweet voice. She dearly\r\nloved France, but she was a broad-minded woman and her knowledge of\r\nAmerican affairs was as great as that of her own country. She rounded\r\nout nearly a century of life, the greater part of which was devoted to\r\nothers, and I pay her the highest tribute in my power when I say that\r\nshe faced the many vicissitudes of life with an undaunted spirit, and\r\nbequeathed to her numerous pupils the inestimable boon of a wonderful\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nAll the teachers in Madame Chegaray's school were men, with the single\r\nexception of Mrs. Joseph McKee, the wife of a Presbyterian clergyman.\r\nAmong those who taught were John Bigelow, who is still living in New\r\nYork at an advanced age, and who in subsequent years was Secretary of\r\nState of New York and our Minister to France; Thatcher T. Payne; Edward\r\nG. Andrew, who became in the course of years a Bishop in the Methodist\r\nChurch; Professor Robert Adrain, who taught mathematics, and who at the\r\nsame time was one of the faculty of Columbia College; and Lorenzo L. da\r\nPonte. The latter was a man of unusual versatility, and was especially\r\ndistinguished as a linguist. He taught us English literature in such a\r\nsuccessful manner that we regarded that study merely as a recreation.\r\nMr. da Ponte was a son of Lorenzo da Ponte, a Venitian of great\r\nlearning, who after coming to this country rendered such conspicuous\r\nservices in connection with Dominick Lynch in establishing Italian opera\r\nin New York. He was also a professor of Italian for many years in\r\nColumbia College, the author of a book of sonnets, several works\r\nrelating to the Italian language and of his own life, which was\r\npublished in three volumes. Mr. Samuel Ward, a noted character of the\r\nday, the brother of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and who married Emily Astor,\r\ndaughter of William B. Astor, wrote an interesting memoir of him. Madame\r\nChegaray taught the highest classes in French. \"If I had to give up all\r\nbooks but two,\" she was fond of saying, \"I would choose the Gospels and\r\nLa Fontaine's Fables. In one you have everything necessary for your\r\nspiritual life; in the other you have the epitome of all worldly\r\nwisdom.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I entered Madame Chegaray's school she had about a hundred pupils,\r\na large number of whom were from the Southern States. How well I\r\nremember the extreme loyalty of the Southern girls to their native soil!\r\nI can close my eyes and read the opening sentence of a composition\r\nwritten by one of my comrades, Elodie Toutant, a sister of General\r\nPierre G. T. Beauregard of the Confederate Army--\"The South, the South,\r\nthe beautiful South, the garden spot of the United States.\" This\r\nchivalric devotion to the soil whence they sprang apparently was\r\nliterally breathed into my Southern school companions from the very\r\nbeginning of their lives. Their loyalty possessed a fascination for me,\r\nand although I was born, reared and educated in a Northern State, I had\r\na tender feeling for the South, which still lingers with me, for most of\r\nthe friendships I formed at Madame Chegaray's were with Southern girls.\r\n\r\nMy first day at Madame Chegaray's, like many other beginnings, was\r\nsomething of an ordeal, but it was my good fortune to meet almost\r\nimmediately Henrietta Croom, a daughter of Henry B. Croom, a celebrated\r\nbotanist of North Carolina, but who, with his family, had spent much of\r\nhis life in Tallahassee. Many are the pleasant hours we spent together,\r\nbut to my sorrow she graduated at an early age, and a few months later\r\nembarked, in company with her parents, a younger brother and sister and\r\nan aunt, Mrs. Cammack, upon a vessel called the _Home_ for Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, where they had planned to make their future residence.\r\nWhen they had been several days at sea their vessel encountered a severe\r\nstorm off Cape Hatteras, and after a brave struggle with the terrific\r\nelements every member of the family sank with the ship within a few\r\nmiles of the spot where the Crooms had formerly lived. This occurred on\r\nthe 9th of October, 1836. They had as fellow voyagers a brother of\r\nMadame Chegaray, who, with his wife and three children, had only just\r\nleft the school to make the voyage to Charleston. They, too, lost their\r\nlives. Over Madame Chegaray's school as well as her household at once\r\nhung a pall, and gloom and mourning prevailed on every side; indeed, the\r\nwhole city of New York shared in our sorrow. The newspapers of the day\r\nwere filled with accounts of this direful disaster, but there were few\r\nsurvivors to tell the tale. My late playmate, Henrietta Croom, was one\r\nof the most popular girls at school, possessing great attractions of\r\nboth mind and person, and, although at the time she was merely a child\r\nin years, the New Year's address of a prominent daily newspaper of the\r\nday contained an extended reference to her which strongly appealed to my\r\ngrief-stricken fancy. Though more than sixty years have passed I have\r\nalways preserved it with great care in memory of the \"sweet damsel\" of\r\nlong ago. The following are the lines to which I have just referred:\r\n\r\n    Dear Home! what magic trembles in the word;\r\n    Each bosom's fountain at its sound is stirred,\r\n    Disgusted worldlings dream of early love\r\n    And weary Christians turn their eyes above--\r\n    Well was't thou nam'd, fair bark, whose recent doom\r\n    Has many a household wrapt in deepest gloom!\r\n    On earth no more those voyagers' steps shall roam\r\n    That cast their anchor at an Heavenly \"Home\"!\r\n    High beat their hearts, when first their fated prow\r\n    Cut through the surge that boils above them now,\r\n    They saw in vision rapt their fatherland\r\n    And felt once more its odorous breezes bland--\r\n    The frozen North receded from their sight\r\n    And fancy's dream entranced them with delight--\r\n    Oh! who can tell what pangs their soul assail'd\r\n    When every hope of life and rescue fail'd,\r\n    When wild despair their throbbing bosoms wrung\r\n    And winds and waves a doleful requiem sung?\r\n    There stood the husband whose protecting arm\r\n    'Till now had kept his lov'd ones safe from harm.\r\n    Remorseless grown, the demon of the storm\r\n    Swept from his grasp her trembling, fragile form.\r\n    Vague fear o'er children's lineaments convuls'd,\r\n    But selfish hands their frenzied cling repuls'd.\r\n    When death's grim aspect meets the startl'd view\r\n    To grovelling souls fair mercy bids adieu!\r\n    And thou, sweet damsel! who in girlhood's bloom\r\n    Descended then to fill an ocean tomb--\r\n    What were _thy_ thoughts, when roaring for their prey\r\n    The foaming billows choked the watery way!\r\n    'Tis said that souls have giv'n in parting hour\r\n    A vast and fearful and mysterious power.\r\n    A chart pictorial of the past is made,\r\n    In which minute events are all portray'd--\r\n    One painful glance the scroll entire surveys\r\n    And then in death the blasted eye-balls glaze--\r\n    Perchance at that dark moment when the maid\r\n    On life's dim verge her coming doom survey'd,\r\n    Such vision flash'd across her spirit pure,\r\n    And help'd the youthful beauty to endure.\r\n    Her infant sports beneath the spreading lime,\r\n    Her recent school-days, in a northern clime--\r\n    Her gentle deeds--her treasur'd thoughts of love--\r\n    All plum'd her pinions for a flight above!\r\n\r\nThe Croom family owned large plantations in the South together with many\r\nslaves. A short time after it was definitely known that not a member of\r\nthe family had survived, there was a legal contest over the estate by\r\nthe representatives of both sides of the household, the Crooms and the\r\nArmisteads. Eminent members of the Southern bar were employed, among\r\nwhom were Judge John McPherson Berrien of Savannah and Joseph M. White\r\nof Florida, often called \"Florida White.\" After about twenty years of\r\nlitigation the suit was decided in favor of the Armisteads. It seems\r\nthat as young Croom, a lad of twelve, nearly reached the shore he was\r\nregarded as the survivor, and his grandmother, Mrs. Henrietta Smith of\r\nNewbern, North Carolina, his nearest living relative, became his heir. I\r\nhave always understood that this hotly contested case has since been\r\nregarded as a judicial precedent.\r\n\r\nA few days after receiving the news of the shipwreck of the _Home_, I\r\nfound by accident in my father's library an _édition de luxe_, just\r\npublished in London, of \"Les Dames de Byron.\" In it was an illustration\r\nentitled \"Leila,\" which bore a wonderful resemblance to my best friend,\r\nHenrietta Croom. Beneath were the following lines, which seemed to\r\nsuggest her history, and the coincidence was so apparent that I\r\nimmediately committed them to memory, and it is from memory that I now\r\ngive them:\r\n\r\n    She sleeps beneath the wandering wave;\r\n    Ah! had she but an earthly grave\r\n    This aching heart and throbbing breast\r\n    Would seek and share her narrow rest.\r\n    She was a form of life and light\r\n    That soon became a part of sight,\r\n    And rose where'er I turned mine eye--\r\n    The morning-star of memory.\r\n\r\nAnother schoolmate and friend of mine at Madame Chegaray's was Josephine\r\nHabersham of Savannah, a daughter of Joseph Habersham and a\r\ngreat-granddaughter of General Joseph Habersham, who succeeded Timothy\r\nPickering as Postmaster General during Washington's second term and\r\nretained the position under Adams and Jefferson until the latter part of\r\n1801. She was one of Madame Chegaray's star pupils in music. She\r\nfrequently made visits to my home, remaining over Saturday and Sunday,\r\nand delighted the family by playing in a most masterly manner the\r\nItalian music then in vogue. A few years after her return to her\r\nSouthern home she married her cousin, William Neyle Habersham, an\r\naccomplished musician. For many years they lived in Savannah in the\r\ngreatest elegance, until the Civil War came to disturb their tranquil\r\ndreams. Two young sons, both under twenty-one, laid down their lives for\r\nthe Southern cause during that conflict. After their great sorrow music\r\nwas their chief solace, and they delighted their friends by playing\r\ntogether on various musical instruments.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans was represented at our school by a famous beauty, Catharine\r\nAlexander Chew, a daughter of Beverly Chew, the Collector of the Port of\r\nNew Orleans, and whose wife, Miss Maria Theodosia Duer, was a sister of\r\nPresident William Alexander Duer of Columbia College. He and Richard\r\nRelf, cashier of the Louisiana State Bank, were the business partners\r\nand subsequently the executors of the will of Daniel Clark of the same\r\ncity, and it was against them that the latter's daughter, Myra Clark\r\nGaines, the widow of General Edmund Pendleton Gaines, U.S.A., fought her\r\nfamous legal battles for over half a century. Miss Chew married Judge\r\nThomas H. Kennedy of New Orleans and left many descendants. The sister\r\nof General Pierre G. T. Beauregard, Elodie Toutant, whom I have already\r\nmentioned, was also from Louisiana. She was a studious girl, and a most\r\nattractive companion. The original family name was Toutant, but towards\r\nthe close of the sixteenth century the last male descendant of the\r\nfamily died, and an only surviving daughter having married Sieur Paix de\r\nBeauregard, the name became Toutant de Beauregard, the prefix _de_\r\nhaving subsequently been dropped.\r\n\r\nStill another friendship I formed at Madame Chegaray's school was with\r\nElizabeth Clarkson Jay, which through life was a source of intense\r\npleasure to me and lasted until her pure and gentle spirit returned to\r\nits Maker. She was the daughter of Peter Augustus Jay, a highly\r\nrespected lawyer, and a granddaughter of the distinguished statesman,\r\nJohn Jay. She was a deeply religious woman, and died a few years ago in\r\nNew York after a life consecrated to good works.\r\n\r\nOne of the brightest girls in my class was Sarah Jones, a daughter of\r\none of New York's most distinguished jurists, Chancellor Samuel Jones.\r\nShe and another schoolmate of mine, Maria Brandegee, who lived in LeRoy\r\nPlace, were intimate and inseparable companions. The mother of the\r\nlatter belonged to a Creole family from New Orleans, named Déslonde, and\r\nwas the aunt of the wife of John Slidell of Confederate fame. The\r\nBrandegees were devout Roman Catholics, while the members of the Jones\r\nfamily were equally ardent Episcopalians. Archbishop Hughes of New York\r\nwas a welcome and frequent visitor at the Brandegee house, where, in my\r\nyounger days, I frequently had the pleasure of meeting him and listening\r\nto his attractive conversation. In this manner Sarah Jones also came\r\ninto contact with him. Deeply impressed by his teachings, she followed\r\nhim to the Cathedral, where she soon became a regular attendant. In the\r\ncourse of time she became a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and a\r\nfew years later entered the order of the _Sacre Coeur_, at\r\nManhattanville, where she eventually became Mother Superior and remained\r\nas such for many years.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of years ago I was the guest of the family of Charles\r\nO'Conor, the distinguished jurist and leader of the New York bar, at his\r\nhandsome home at Fort Washington, a suburb of New York. He was the son\r\nof the venerable Thomas O'Conor, editor of _The Shamrock_, the first\r\npaper published in New York for Irish and Catholic readers, and also the\r\nauthor of a history of the second war with Great Britain. One afternoon\r\nMr. O'Conor suggested that I should accompany him upon a drive to the\r\nConvent of the _Sacre Coeur_ a few miles distant. He was anxious to\r\nconfer with Madame Mary Aloysia Hardey, who was then Mother Superior. I\r\nwas delighted to accept this invitation, as Mr. O'Conor was an\r\nexceptionally agreeable companion and his spare moments were but few and\r\nfar between. Before reaching our destination, I remarked that Madame\r\nJones, an old schoolmate of mine, was an inmate of this Convent, and\r\nthat I should be very glad to see her again. Upon our arrival, Sarah\r\nJones greeted me in the parlor and seemed glad to see me after the lapse\r\nof so many years. Leading as she was the life of a _religieuse_, our\r\ntopics of conversation were few, but I noticed that she seemed\r\ninterested in discussing her own family, about whom evidently she was\r\nnot well informed. After a brief visit and while homeward bound, Mr.\r\nO'Conor inquired whether Madame Jones knew that her father, the\r\nChancellor, was rapidly approaching death. I replied that apparently she\r\nhad no knowledge of his serious condition, and several days later I saw\r\nhis death announced in a daily newspaper. Many years after my interview\r\nwith Sarah Jones I met at the residence of Mrs. Henry R. Winthrop of New\r\nYork an older sister of hers, Mary Anna Schuyler Jones, who at the time\r\nwas the widow of the Reverend Dr. Samuel Seabury of the Episcopal\r\nChurch. We lunched together, and the conversation naturally drifted back\r\nto other days and to my old schoolmate, her sister, Sarah Jones. She\r\ntold me that she had seen but little of her in recent years, but related\r\na curious episode in regard to meeting her under unusual circumstances.\r\nIt seems that Mrs. Seabury, accompanied by a young daughter, was\r\nreturning from a visit to Europe, when she noticed that the occupants of\r\nthe adjoining state-room were unusually quiet. In time she made the\r\ndiscovery that they were nuns returning from a business trip abroad.\r\nUpon examination of the passenger list, she discovered to her\r\nastonishment that her sister, Madame Jones, was occupying the adjoining\r\nroom. They met daily thereafter throughout the voyage, and afterwards\r\nreturned to their respective homes.\r\n\r\nI especially remember an incident of my school-life which was decidedly\r\nsensational. Sally Otis, a young and pretty girl and a daughter of James\r\nW. Otis, then of New York but formerly of Boston, was in the same class\r\nwith me. One morning we missed her from her accustomed seat, but during\r\nthe day we learned the cause of her absence. The whole Otis family had\r\nbeen taken ill by drinking poisoned coffee. Upon investigation the cook\r\nreported that a package of coffee had been sent to the house, and,\r\ntaking it for granted that it had been ordered by some member of the\r\nhousehold, she had used it for breakfast. The whole matter was shrouded\r\nin mystery, and gossip was rife. One story was that a vindictive woman\r\nconcentrated all of her malice upon a single member of the family\r\nagainst whom she had a grievance and thus endangered the lives of the\r\nwhole Otis family. Fortunately, none of the cases proved fatal, but\r\nseveral inmates of the house became seriously ill.\r\n\r\nA few years before I entered Madame Chegaray's school, Virginia Scott,\r\nthe oldest daughter of Major General Winfield Scott, enjoyed _Tante's_\r\ntutelage for a number of years. She was a rare combination of genius and\r\nbeauty, and, apart from her remarkable personality, was a skilled\r\nlinguist and an accomplished vocal and instrumental musician. This\r\nunusual combination of gifts suggests the Spanish saying: \"Mira\r\nfavorecida de Dios\" (\"Behold one favored of God!\"). Her life, however,\r\nwas brief, though deeply interesting. In the first blush of womanhood\r\nshe accompanied her mother and sisters to Europe, and, after several\r\nyears spent in Paris, made a visit to Rome, where she immediately became\r\nimbued with profound religious convictions. Through the instrumentality\r\nof Father Pierce Connelly, a convert to Catholicism, she was received\r\ninto the Roman Catholic Church while in the Holy City, and made her\r\nprofession of faith in the Chapel of St. Ignatius, where the ceremony\r\ntook place by the special permission of the Most Rev. John Roothan,\r\nGeneral of the Jesuits. General Scott meanwhile had returned to the\r\nUnited States, having been promoted to the rank of Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Army with headquarters in Washington. Accompanied by her mother,\r\nVirginia Scott returned to America and, after a short time spent with\r\nher parents in Washington, drove to Georgetown and, without their\r\nknowledge or consent, was received there as an inmate of the \"Convent of\r\nthe Visitation.\" Her family was bitterly opposed to the step, more\r\nespecially her mother, whose indignation was so pronounced that she\r\nnever to the day of her death forgave the Church for depriving her of\r\nher daughter's companionship. General Scott, however, frequently visited\r\nher in her cloistered home, and always manifested much consideration for\r\nthe Convent as well as for the nuns, the daily companions of his\r\ndaughter. Although she possessed a proud and imperious nature, combined\r\nwith great personal beauty and much natural _hauteur_, she soon became\r\nas gentle as a lamb. She died about a year after entering the Convent,\r\nbut she retained her deep religious convictions to the last. She is\r\nburied beneath the sanctuary in the chapel of the Georgetown Convent. In\r\nconnection with her a few lines often come to my mind which seem so\r\nappropriate that I can not deny myself the pleasure of quoting them:\r\n\r\n    She was so fair that in the Angelic choir,\r\n    She will not need put on another shape\r\n    Than that she bore on earth.\r\n\r\nI have heard it stated that during Virginia Scott's residence in Paris\r\nthere existed a deep attachment between herself and a young gentleman of\r\nforeign birth. The story goes that in the course of time he became as\r\ndevoted to his religion as he had hitherto been to the beautiful\r\nAmerican, and that it was agreed between them that they should both\r\nconsecrate themselves thereafter to the service of God. He accordingly\r\nentered at once upon a religious life. I have heard that they afterwards\r\nmet at a service before the altar, but that there was no recognition. As\r\nintimate as I became with the members of the Scott family in subsequent\r\nyears, I never heard any allusion to this incident in their family\r\nhistory, and I can readily understand that it was a subject upon which\r\nthey were too sensitive to dwell.\r\n\r\nFather Connelly, whom I have mentioned in connection with Miss Scott's\r\nconversion, began his career as an Episcopal clergyman. There was a\r\nbarrier to his becoming a Roman Catholic priest, as he was married; but\r\nhis wife soon shared in his religious ardor, and when he entered the\r\npriesthood she became a nun. He lacked stability, however, in his\r\nreligious views, and was subsequently received again into the Episcopal\r\nChurch. It was his desire that his wife should at once join him but she\r\nrefused to leave the Convent, and she finally became the founder of the\r\nOrder of the \"Sisters of the Holy Child.\" I have heard that he took\r\nlegal measures to obtain possession of her, but if so he was\r\nunsuccessful in his efforts.\r\n\r\nAnother one of Madame Chegaray's distinguished pupils was Martha Pierce\r\nof Louisville. As she attended this school some years before I entered,\r\nI knew of her in these days only by reputation. But some years later I\r\nhad the pleasure of knowing her quite intimately, when she talked very\r\nfreely with me in regard to her eventful life. She told me that upon a\r\ncertain occasion in the days when women rarely traveled alone she was\r\nreturning to Kentucky under the care of Henry Clay, and stopped in\r\nWashington long enough to visit the Capitol. Upon its steps she was\r\nintroduced to Robert Craig Stanard of Richmond, upon whom she apparently\r\nmade a deep impression, for one year later the handsome young Southerner\r\ncarried the Kentucky girl, at the age of sixteen, back to Virginia as\r\nhis bride. During her long life in Richmond her home, now the\r\nWestmoreland Club, was a notable _salon_, where the _beaux esprits_ of\r\nthe South gathered. She survived Mr. Stanard many years. Beautiful, even\r\nin old age, gifted and cultivated, her attractions of face and intellect\r\npaled before her inexpressible charm of manner. She traveled much abroad\r\nand especially in England. A prominent Kentuckian once told me that he\r\nheard Washington Irving say that Mrs. Stanard received more attention\r\nand admiration in the highest circles of English society than any other\r\nAmerican woman he had ever known. She corresponded for many years with\r\nThackeray, the Duke of Wellington and many other prominent Englishmen,\r\nand in her own country was equally distinguished. In the course of one\r\nof our numerous conversations she told me that after the death of Edward\r\nEverett she loaned his biographer the letters she had received from that\r\ndistinguished orator. During the latter part of her life she gave up her\r\nhouse in Richmond and came to Washington to reside, where she remained\r\nuntil the end of her life. She left no descendants. Her husband's\r\nmother, Jane Stith Craig, daughter of Adam Craig of Richmond, was\r\nimmortalized by Edgar Allan Poe, who, fictitiously naming her \"Helen,\"\r\npaid feeling tribute to her charms in those beautiful verses commencing:\r\n\r\n    Helen, thy beauty is to me\r\n      Like those Nicean barks of yore,\r\n    That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,\r\n      The weary, way-worn wanderer bore\r\n      To his own native shore.\r\n\r\nAmong my other schoolmates at Madame Chegaray's were Susan Maria\r\nClarkson de Peyster, a daughter of James Ferguson de Peyster, who\r\nsubsequently married Robert Edward Livingston; Margaret Masters, a\r\ndaughter of Judge Josiah Masters of Troy, New York, and the wife of John\r\nW. King; Virginia Beverly Wood, a daughter of Silas Wood of New York,\r\nwho became the wife of John Leverett Rogers; and Elizabeth MacNiel,\r\ndaughter of General John MacNiel of the Army and wife of General Henry\r\nW. Benham of the U.S. Engineer Corps.\r\n\r\nAfter a number of years spent in teaching, Madame Chegaray gave up her\r\nNew York school and moved to Madison, New Jersey (at one time called\r\nBottle Hill), with the intention of spending the remainder of her life\r\nin retirement; but she was doomed to disappointment. Discovering almost\r\nimmediately that through a relative her affairs had become deeply\r\ninvolved, she with undaunted courage at once opened a school in Madison\r\nin the house which she had purchased with the view of spending there the\r\ndeclining years of her life. Previous to this time I had been one of her\r\nday scholars; I entered the second school as a boarding pupil. Once a\r\nweek we were driven three miles to Morristown to attend church. I recall\r\nan amusing incident connected with this weekly visit to that place. One\r\nSunday a fellow boarder, thinking that perhaps she might find some\r\nleisure before the service to perfect herself in her lesson for the\r\nfollowing day, thoughtlessly took along with her a volume of French\r\nplays by Voltaire. During the service someone in a near pew observed the\r\nauthor's name upon the book, and forthwith the Morristown populace was\r\nstartled to hear that among Madame Chegaray's pupils was a follower of\r\nthe noted infidel. It took some time to convince the public that this\r\nbook was carried to church by my schoolmate without her teacher's\r\nknowledge; and the girl was horrified to learn that she was\r\nunintentionally to blame for a new local scandal. While I was at Madame\r\nChegaray's I owned a schoolbook entitled \"Shelley, Coleridge and Keats.\"\r\nI brought it home with me one day, but my father took it away from me\r\nand, as I learned later, burned it, owing to his detestation of\r\nShelley's moral character. On one occasion he quoted in court some\r\nextracts from Shelley as illustrative of the poet's character, but I\r\ncannot recall the passage.\r\n\r\nAfter two years spent in Madison, Madame Chegaray returned to New York\r\nand reopened her school on the corner of Union Square and Fifteenth\r\nStreet in three houses built for her by Samuel B. Ruggles. At that time\r\nthe omnibuses had been running only to Fourteenth Street, but, out of\r\ncourtesy to this noble woman, their route was extended to Fifteenth\r\nStreet, where a lamp for the same reason was placed by the city. Madame\r\nChegaray taught here for many years, but finally moved to 78 Madison\r\nAvenue, where she remained until, on account of old age, she was obliged\r\nto give up her teaching.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still attending Madame Chegaray's school, my father, under\r\nthe impression that I was not quite as proficient in mathematics and\r\nastronomy as it was his desire and ambition that I should be, employed\r\nProfessor Robert Adrian of Columbia College to give me private\r\ninstruction in my own home. Under his able tuition, I particularly\r\nenjoyed traversing the firmament. I was always faithful to the planet\r\nVenus, whose beauty was to me then, as now, a constant delight. In those\r\nyouthful days my proprietorship in this heavenly body seemed to me as\r\nwell established as in a Fifth Avenue lot, and was quite as tangible. I\r\nregarded myself in the light of an individual proprietor, and, like\r\nAlexander Selkirk in his far away island of the sea, my right to this\r\ncelestial domain there was none to dispute.\r\n\r\nAfter the flight of so many years, and in view, also, of the fact that\r\nsometimes the world seems to us older women to be almost turned upside\r\ndown, it may not be uninteresting to speak of some of the books which\r\nwere familiar to me during my school days. One of the first I ever read\r\nwas \"Clarissa Harlowe\" by Samuel Richardson. \"Cecilia,\" by Frances\r\nBurney, was another well-known book of the day. Mrs. Amelia Opie was\r\nalso a popular authoress, and her novel entitled \"White Lies\" should, in\r\nmy opinion, grace every library. Miss Maria Edgeworth and Mrs. Ann Eliza\r\nBray, the latter of whom so graphically depicted the higher phases of\r\nEnglish life, were popular authoresses in my earlier days in New York.\r\nMany years later some of the books I have mentioned were republished by\r\nthe Harpers. \"Gil Blas,\" whose author, Le Sage, was the skilful\r\ndelineator of human nature, its attributes and its frailties, was much\r\nread, and, in my long journey through life, certain portions of this\r\nbook have often been recalled to me by my many and varied experiences. I\r\nmust not fail to speak of the \"Children of the Abbey,\" by Regina M.\r\nRoche, where the fascinations of Lord Leicester are so vividly\r\nportrayed; nor of another book entitled \"The Three Spaniards,\" by George\r\nWalker, which used to strike terror to my unsophisticated soul.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Chegaray retired temporarily from her school life and moved\r\nto Madison in New Jersey, Charles Canda, who had taught drawing for her,\r\nestablished a school of his own in New York which became very prominent.\r\nHe had an attractive young daughter, who met with a most heartrending\r\nend. On her way to a ball, in company with one of her girl friends,\r\nCharlotte Canda was thrown from her carriage, and when picked up her\r\nlife was extinct. As there were no injuries found upon her body, it was\r\ngenerally supposed that the shock brought on an attack of heart-failure.\r\nSubsequently the disconsolate parents ordered from Italy a monument\r\ncosting a fabulous sum of money for those days, which was placed over\r\nthe grave of their only daughter in Greenwood Cemetery, where it still\r\ncontinues to command the admiration of sightseers. This tragic incident\r\noccurred in February, 1845, on the eve of the victim's seventeenth\r\nbirthday.\r\n\r\nWhile Madame Chegaray was my teacher there was a charming French society\r\nin New York, her house being the rendezvous of this interesting social\r\ncircle. I recall with much pleasure the names of Boisseau, Trudeau,\r\nBoisaubin, Thebaud and Brugiere. Madame Chegaray's sister, Caroline,\r\ntogether with her husband, Charles Bérault, who taught dancing, and\r\ntheir three daughters, resided with her. The oldest, Madame Vincente\r\nRose Améline (Madame George R. A. Chaulet), taught music for her aunt;\r\nthe second niece, Marie-Louise Joséphine Laure, married Joseph U. F.\r\nd'Hervilly, a Frenchman, and in after life established a school in\r\nPhiladelphia which she named Chegaray Institute; while the youngest,\r\nPauline, married a gentleman from Cuba, named de Ruiz, and now resides\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nLIFE AND EXPERIENCES IN THE METROPOLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nMy health was somewhat impaired by an attack of chills and fever while I\r\nwas still a pupil at Madame Chegaray's school. Long Island was\r\nespecially affected with this malady, and even certain locations on the\r\nHudson were on this account regarded with disfavor. In subsequent years,\r\nwhen the building operations of the Hudson River railroad cut off the\r\nwater in many places and formed stagnant pools, it became much worse. As\r\nI began to convalesce, Dr. John W. Francis prescribed a change of air,\r\nand I was accordingly sent to Saratoga to be under the care of my\r\nfriend, Mrs. Richard Armistead of North Carolina. A few days after my\r\narrival we were joined by Mrs. De Witt Clinton and her attractive\r\nstep-daughter, Julia Clinton. The United States Hotel, where we stayed,\r\nwas thronged with visitors, but as I was only a young girl my\r\nobservation of social life was naturally limited and I knew but few\r\npersons. Mrs. Clinton was a granddaughter of Philip Livingston, the\r\nSigner, and married at a mature age. She had a natural and most profound\r\nadmiration for the memory of her illustrious husband, whom I have heard\r\nher describe as \"a prince among men,\" and she cherished an undying\r\nresentment for any of his political antagonists.\r\n\r\nWhile we were still at the United States Hotel, Martin Van Buren, at\r\nthat time President of the United States, arrived in Saratoga and\r\nsojourned at the same hotel with us. His visit made an indelible\r\nimpression upon my memory owing to a highly sensational incident. During\r\nthe evening of the President's arrival Mrs. Clinton was promenading in\r\nthe large parlor of the hotel, leaning upon the arm of the Portuguese\r\n_Chargé d'Affaires_, Senhor Joaquim Cesar de Figanière, when Mr. Van\r\nBuren espying her advanced with his usual suavity of manner to meet her.\r\nWith a smile upon his face, he extended his hand, whereupon Mrs. Clinton\r\nimmediately turned her back and compelled her escort to imitate her,\r\napparently ignoring the fact that he was a foreign diplomat and that his\r\nconduct might subsequently be resented by the authorities in Washington.\r\nThis incident, occurring as it did in a crowded room, was observed by\r\nmany of the guests and naturally created much comment. In talking over\r\nthe incident the next day Mrs. Clinton told me she was under the\r\nimpression that Mr. Van Buren clearly understood her feelings in regard\r\nto him, as some years previous, when he and General Andrew Jackson\r\ncalled upon her together, she had declined to see him, although Jackson\r\nhad been admitted. This act was characteristic of the woman. It was the\r\nexpression of a resentment which she had harbored against Mr. Van Buren\r\nfor years and which she was only abiding her time to display. I was\r\nstanding at Mrs. Clinton's side during this dramatic episode, and to my\r\nyouthful fancy she seemed, indeed, a heroine!\r\n\r\nMrs. Clinton was a social leader in Gotham before the days of the\r\n_nouveaux riches_, and her sway was that of an autocrat. Her presence\r\nwas in every way imposing. She possessed many charming characteristics\r\nand was in more respects than one an uncrowned queen, retaining her\r\nwonderful tact and social power until the day of her death. I love to\r\ndwell upon Mrs. Clinton because, apart from her remarkable personal\r\ncharacteristics, she was the friend of my earlier life. Possessed as she\r\nwas of many eccentricities, her excellencies far counterbalanced them.\r\nOf the latter, I recall especially the unusual ability and care she\r\ndisplayed in housekeeping, which at that time was regarded as an\r\naccomplishment in which every woman took particular pride. To be still\r\nmore specific, she apparently had a much greater horror of dirt than the\r\naverage housewife, and carried her antipathy to such an extent that she\r\ntolerated but few fires in her University Place establishment in New\r\nYork, as she seriously objected to the uncleanness caused by the dust\r\nand ashes! No matter how cold her house nor how frigid the day, she\r\nnever seemed to suffer but, on the contrary, complained that her home\r\nwas overheated. Her guests frequently commented upon \"the nipping and\r\neager air\" which Shakespeare's Horatio speaks of, but it made no\r\napparent impression upon their hostess.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clinton's articulation was affected by a slight stammer, which, in\r\nmy opinion, but added piquancy to her epigrammatic sayings. She once\r\nremarked to me, \"I shall never be c-c-cold until I'm dead.\" An impulse\r\ntook possession of me which somehow, in spite of the great difference in\r\nour ages, I seemed unable to resist, and I retorted, \"We are not all\r\nassured of our temperatures at that period.\" She regarded me for a few\r\nmoments with unfeigned astonishment, but said nothing. I did not suffer\r\nfor my temerity at that moment, but later I was chagrined to learn she\r\nhad remarked that I was the most impertinent girl she had ever known. I\r\nremember that upon another occasion she told me that one of Governor\r\nClinton's grandchildren, Augusta Clinton, was about to leave school at a\r\nvery early age. \"Doesn't she intend to finish her education?\" I\r\ninquired. \"No,\" was the quick and emphatic but stuttering reply, \"she's\r\nhad sufficient education. I was at school only two months, and I'm sure\r\nI'm smart enough.\" Her niece, Margaret Gelston, who was present and was\r\nremarkable for her clear wits, retorted: \"Only think how much smarter\r\nyou'd have been if you had remained longer.\" In an angry tone Mrs.\r\nClinton replied, \"I don't want to be any smarter, I'm smart enough.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Clinton's two nieces, the Misses Mary and Margaret Gelston, were\r\namong my earliest and most intimate friends. They occupied a prominent\r\nsocial position in New York and both were well known for their unusual\r\nintellectuality. They were daughters of Maltby Gelston, President of the\r\nManhattan Bank, and granddaughters of David Gelston, who was appointed\r\nCollector of the Port of New York by Jefferson and retained that\r\nposition for twenty years. Late in life Mary Gelston married Henry R.\r\nWinthrop of New York. She died a few years ago leaving an immense estate\r\nto Princeton Theological Seminary. \"I pray,\" reads her will, \"that the\r\nTrustees of this Institution may make such use of this bequest as that\r\nthe extension of the Church of Christ on earth and the glory of God may\r\nbe promoted thereby.\" In the same instrument she adds: \"As a similar\r\nbequest would have been made by my deceased sister, Margaret L. Gelston,\r\nhad she survived me, I desire that the said Trustees should regard it as\r\ngiven jointly by my said sister and by me.\" Some distant relatives,\r\nthinking that her money could be more satisfactorily employed than in\r\nthe manner indicated, contested the will, and the Seminary finally\r\nreceived, as the result of a compromise, between $1,600,000 and\r\n$1,700,000.\r\n\r\nOne of my earliest recollections is of John Jacob Astor, a feeble old\r\nman descending the doorsteps of his home on Broadway near Houston Street\r\nto enter his carriage. His house was exceedingly plain and was one of a\r\nrow owned by him. His son, William Backhouse Astor, who married a\r\ndaughter of General John Armstrong, Secretary of War under President\r\nMadison, during at least a portion of his father's life lived in a fine\r\nhouse on Lafayette Place. I have attended evening parties there that\r\nwere exceedingly simple in character, and at which Mrs. Astor was always\r\nplainly dressed and wore no jewels. I have a very distinct recollection\r\nof one of these parties owing to a ludicrous incident connected with\r\nmyself. My mother was a woman of decidedly domestic tastes, whose whole\r\nlife was so immersed in her large family of children that she never\r\nallowed an event of a social character to interfere with what she\r\nregarded as her household or maternal duties. We older children were\r\ntherefore much thrown upon our own resources from a social point of\r\nview, and when I grew into womanhood and entered society I was usually\r\naccompanied to entertainments by my father. Sometimes, however, I went\r\nwith my lifelong friend, Margaret Tillotson Kemble, a daughter of\r\nWilliam Kemble, of whom I shall speak hereafter. Upon this particular\r\noccasion I had gone early in the day to the Kembles preparatory to\r\nspending the night there, with the intention of attending a ball at the\r\nAstors'. Having dined, supped, and dressed myself for the occasion, in\r\ncompany with Miss Kemble and her father I reached the Astor residence,\r\nwhere I found on the doorstep an Irish maid from my own home awaiting my\r\narrival. In her hand she held an exquisite bouquet of pink and white\r\njaponicas which had been sent to me by John Still Winthrop, the _fiancé_\r\nof Susan Armistead, another of my intimate friends. The bouquet had\r\narrived just after my departure from home and, quite unknown to my\r\nfamily, the Irish maid out of the goodness of her heart had taken it\r\nupon herself to see that it was placed in my hands. I learned later\r\nthat, much to the amusement of many of the guests, she had been awaiting\r\nmy arrival for several hours. It seems almost needless to add that I\r\ncarried my flowers throughout the evening with much girlish pride and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nAmong the guests at this ball was Mrs. Francis R. Boreel, the young and\r\nbeautiful daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Langdon, who wore in her dark\r\nhair a diamond necklace, a recent gift from her grandfather, John Jacob\r\nAstor. It was currently rumored at the time that it cost twenty thousand\r\ndollars, which was then a very large amount to invest in a single\r\narticle of that character. Mrs. Langdon's two other daughters were Mrs.\r\nMatthew Wilks, who married abroad and spent her life there, and the\r\nfirst Mrs. De Lancey Kane, who made a runaway match, and both of whom\r\nleft descendants in New York. All three women were celebrated for their\r\nbeauty, but Mrs. Boreel was usually regarded as the handsomest of the\r\ntrio. Mrs. Walter Langdon was Dorothea Astor, a daughter of John Jacob\r\nAstor, and her husband was a grandson of Judge John Langdon of New\r\nHampshire, who equipped Stark's regiment for the battle of Bennington,\r\nand who for twelve years was a member of the United States Senate and\r\nwas present as President _pro tempore_ of that body at the first\r\ninauguration of Washington.\r\n\r\nAnother society woman whose presence at this ball I recall, and without\r\nwhom no entertainment was regarded as complete, was Mrs. Charles\r\nAugustus Davis, wife of the author of the well-known \"Jack Downing\r\nLetters.\" Indeed, the name \"Jack Downing\" seemed so much a part of the\r\nDavis family that in after years I have often heard Mrs. Davis called\r\n\"Mrs. Jack Downing.\" The Davises had a handsome daughter who married a\r\ngentleman of French descent, but neither of them long survived the\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nIn an old newspaper of 1807 I came across the following marriage notice,\r\nwhich was the first Astor wedding to occur in this country:\r\n\r\n     BENTZON--ASTOR. Married, on Monday morning, the 14th ult.\r\n     [September], by the Rev. Mr. [Ralph] Williston, Adrian B.\r\n     Bentzon, Esq., of the Isle of St. Croix, to Miss Magdalen\r\n     Astor, daughter of John Jacob Astor of this city.\r\n\r\nIt was while on a cruise among the West Indies that Miss Astor met Mr.\r\nBentzon, a Danish gentleman of good family but moderate fortune. In the\r\nearly part of the last century many ambitious foreigners went to that\r\npart of the world with the intention of making their fortunes.\r\n\r\nAnother daughter of John Jacob Astor, Eliza, married Count Vincent\r\nRumpff, who was for some years Minister at the Court of the Tuileries\r\nfrom the Hanseatic towns of Germany. She was well known through life,\r\nand long remembered after death, for her symmetrical Christian\r\ncharacter. One of her writings, entitled \"Transplanted Flowers,\" has\r\nbeen published in conjunction with one of the Duchesse de Broglie,\r\ndaughter of Madame de Staël, with whom she was intimately associated in\r\nher Christian works.\r\n\r\nHenry Astor, the brother of John Jacob Astor, was the first of the\r\nfamily to come to America. I am able to state, upon the authority of the\r\nlate Rev. Dr. Morgan Dix, rector of Trinity church in New York, and a\r\nlife-long friend of the whole Astor connection, that he was a private in\r\na Hessian regiment that fought against our colonies in the Revolutionary\r\nWar. After its close he decided to remain in New York where he entered\r\nthe employment of a butcher in the old Oswego market. He subsequently\r\nembarked upon more ambitious enterprises, became a highly successful\r\nbusiness man and at his death left a large fortune to his childless\r\nwidow. Dr. Dix has stated that it was probably through him that the\r\nyounger brother came to this country. However this may be, John Jacob\r\nAstor sailed for America as a steerage passenger in a ship commanded by\r\nCapt. Jacob Stout and arrived in Baltimore in January, 1784. He\r\nsubsequently went to New York, where he spent his first night in the\r\nhouse of George Dieterich, a fellow countryman whom he had known in\r\nGermany and by whom he was now employed to peddle cakes. After remaining\r\nin his employ for a time and accumulating a little money he hired a\r\nstore of his own where he sold toys and German knickknacks. He\r\nafterwards added skins and even musical instruments to his stock in\r\ntrade, as will appear from the following in _The Daily Advertiser_ of\r\nNew York, of the 2d of January, 1789, and following issues:\r\n\r\n                      J. Jacob Astor,\r\n                  At No. 81, Queen-street,\r\n        Next door but one to the Friends Meeting-House,\r\n                Has for sale an assortment of\r\n            Piano fortes, of the newest construction,\r\n     Made by the best makers in London, which he will sell on\r\n     reasonable terms.\r\n     He gives Cash for all kinds of FURS:\r\n     And has for sale a quantity of Canada Beaver, and\r\n     Beaver Coating, Racoon Skins, and Racoon Blankets,\r\n     Muskrat Skins, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that these Astor pianos were manufactured in London and\r\nthat George Astor, an elder brother of John Jacob Astor, was associated\r\nwith the latter in their sale. Indeed, one of them, formerly owned by\r\nthe Clinton family and now in Washington's Headquarters in Newburgh,\r\nbears the name of \"Geo. Astor & Co., Cornhill, London;\" while still\r\nanother in my immediate neighborhood in Washington has the inscription\r\nof \"Astor and Camp, 79 Cornhill, London.\" Their octaves were few in\r\nnumber, and a pupil of Chopin would have regarded them with scorn; but\r\nupon these little spindle-legged affairs a duet could be performed. My\r\nfirst knowledge of instrumental music was derived from one of these\r\npianos, and among the earliest recollections of my childhood is that of\r\nhearing my three maiden aunts, my father's sisters, playing in turn the\r\ninspiring Scotch airs upon the Astor piano that stood in their\r\ndrawing-room. One of their songs was especially inimical to cloistered\r\nlife and it, too, was possibly of Scotch origin. I am unable to recall\r\nits exact words, but its refrain ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    I will not be a nun,\r\n    I can not be a nun,\r\n    I shall not be a nun,\r\n    I'm so fond of pleasure\r\n    I'll not be a nun.\r\n\r\nI own an original letter written by John Jacob Astor from New York on\r\nthe 26th of April, 1826, addressed to ex-President James Monroe, my\r\nhusband's grandfather, which I regard as interesting on account of its\r\nquaint style:\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n     Permit me to congratulate you on your Honourable retirement\r\n     [from public life] for which I most sincerely wish you may\r\n     enjoy that Peace and Tranquility to which you are so justly\r\n     entitled.\r\n\r\n     Without wishing to cause you any Inconveniency [sic] on\r\n     account of the loan which I so long since made to you I\r\n     would be glad if you would put it in a train of sittlelment\r\n     [sic] if not the whole let it be a part with the interest\r\n     Due.\r\n\r\n     I hope Dear Sir that you and Mrs. Monroe enjoy the best of\r\n     health and that you may live many years to wittness [sic]\r\n     the Prosperity of the country to which you have so\r\n     generously contributed.\r\n\r\n     I am most Respectfully Dear Sir your obed S. &c.\r\n\r\n          J. J. ASTOR.\r\n\r\n     The Honble James Monroe.\r\n\r\nIt may here be stated that Mr. Astor's solicitude concerning Mr.\r\nMonroe's financial obligation was duly relieved, and that the debt was\r\npaid in full.\r\n\r\nJohn Jacob Astor's numerous descendants can lay this \"flattering\r\nunction\" to their souls, that every dollar of his vast wealth was\r\naccumulated through thrift while leading an upright life.\r\n\r\nAn old-fashioned stage coach in my early days ran between New York and\r\nHarlem, but the fashionable drive was on the west side of the city\r\nalong what was then called the \"Bloomingdale Road.\" Many fashionable New\r\nYorkers owned and occupied handsome country seats along this route, and\r\nclosed their city homes for a period during the heated term. I recall\r\nwith pleasure the home of the Prussian Consul General and Mrs. John\r\nWilliam Schmidt, and especially their attractive daughters. Mr. Schmidt,\r\nwho came to this country as a bachelor, married Miss Eliza Ann Bache of\r\nNew York. Quite a number of years subsequent to this event, before they\r\nhad children of their own, they adopted a little girl whom they named\r\nJulia and whom I knew very well in my early girlhood. As equestrian\r\nexercise was popular in New York at that time, many of the young men and\r\nwomen riding on the Bloomingdale Road would stop at the Schmidts'\r\nhospitable home, rest their horses and enjoy a pleasing half-hour's\r\nconversation with the daughters of the household. Among the fair riders\r\nwas Mary Tallmadge, a famous beauty and a daughter of General James\r\nTallmadge. During her early life and at a period when visits abroad were\r\nfew and far between, her father accompanied her to Europe. During her\r\ntravels on the continent she visited St. Petersburg, where her beauty\r\ncreated a great sensation. While there the Emperor Nicholas I. presented\r\nher with a handsome India shawl. She returned to America, married Philip\r\nS. Van Rensselaer, a son of the old Patroon, and lived for many years on\r\nWashington Square in New York.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton and family also owned and occupied a house in this\r\ncharming suburb called \"The Grange.\" It was subsequently occupied by\r\nHerman Thorne, who had married Miss Jane Mary Jauncey, a wealthy heiress\r\nof New York. He lived in this house only a few years when he went with\r\nhis wife to reside in Paris during the reign of Louis Philippe. Mr.\r\nThorne became the most prominent American resident there and excited\r\nthe envy of many of his countrymen by his lavish expenditure of money.\r\nHis daughters made foreign matrimonial alliances. He was originally from\r\nSchenectady, for a time was a purser in the U.S. Navy, and was\r\nremarkable for his handsome presence and courtly bearing.\r\n\r\nJacob Lorillard lived in a handsome house in Manhattanville, a short\r\ndistance from the Bloomingdale Road. He began life, first as an\r\napprentice and then as a proprietor, in the tanning and hide business,\r\nand his tannery was on Pearl Street. He then, with his brothers,\r\nembarked in the manufacture and sale of snuff and tobacco, in which, as\r\nis well known, he amassed an immense fortune. My earliest recollection\r\nof the family is in the days of its great prosperity. One of Mr.\r\nLorillard's daughters, Julia, who married Daniel Edgar, I knew very\r\nwell, and I recall a visit I once made her in her beautiful home, where\r\nI also attended her wedding a few years later. At this time her mother\r\nwas a widow, and shortly after the marriage the place was sold to the\r\nCatholic order of the _Sacre Coeur_. Mrs. Jacob Lorillard was a daughter\r\nof the Rev. Doctor Johann Christoff Kunze, professor of Oriental\r\nLanguages in Columbia College.\r\n\r\nMany years ago the wags of London exhausted their wits in fittingly\r\ncharacterizing and ridiculing the numerous equipages of a London\r\nmanufacturer of snuff and tobacco. One couplet suggestive of the manner\r\nin which this vast wealth was acquired, was\r\n\r\n    Who would have thought it\r\n    That Noses had bought it.\r\n\r\nThe suitor of the daughter of this wealthy Englishman was appropriately\r\ndubbed \"Up to Snuff.\" Alas, this ancestral and aristocratic luxury of\r\nsnuff departed many years ago, but succeeding generations have been \"up\r\nto snuff\" in many other ways. The gold snuff-box frequently studded\r\nwith gems which I remember so well in days gone by and especially at the\r\nhome Gouverneur Kemble in Cold Spring, where it was passed around and\r\nfreely used by both men and women, now commands no respect except as an\r\nancestral curio. Dryden, Dean Swift, Pope, Addison, Lord Chesterfield,\r\nDr. Johnson, Garrick, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Keats, Charles Lamb, Gibbon,\r\nWalter Scott and Darwin were among the prominent worshipers of the\r\nsnuff-box and its contents, while some of them indulged in the habit to\r\nthe degree of intemperance. In describing his manner of using the\r\nsnuff-box Gibbon wrote: \"I drew my snuff-box, rapped it, took snuff\r\ntwice, and continued my discourse in my usual attitude of my body bent\r\nforwards, and my fore-finger stretched out;\" and Boswell wrote in its\r\npraise:\r\n\r\n    Oh, snuff! our fashionable end and aim--\r\n    Strasburgh, Rappe, Dutch, Scotch--whate'er thy name!\r\n    Powder celestial! quintessence divine\r\n    New joys entrance my soul while thou art mine;\r\n    Who takes? who takes thee not? Where'er I range\r\n    I smell thy sweets from Pall Mall to the 'Change.\r\n\r\nWhile the spirit of patriotism was as prevalent in early New York as it\r\nis now, it seems to me that it was somewhat less demonstrative. The 4th\r\nof July, however, was anticipated by the youngsters of the day with the\r\ngreatest eagerness and pleasure. It was the habit of my father, for many\r\nyears, to take us children early in the morning to the City Hall to\r\nattend the official observances of the day, an experience which we\r\nnaturally regarded as a great privilege. Booths were temporarily erected\r\nall along the pavement in front of the City Hall, where substantial food\r\nwas displayed and sold to the crowds collected to assist in celebrating\r\nthe day. About noon several military companies arrived upon the scene\r\nand took their positions in the park, where, after a number of\r\ninteresting maneuvers, a salute was fired which was terrifying to my\r\nyouthful nerves. Small boys, then as now, provided themselves with\r\npistols, and human life was occasionally sacrificed to patriotic ardor,\r\nalthough I never remember hearing of cases of lockjaw resulting from\r\nsuch accidents, as is so frequently the case at present. Firecrackers\r\nand torpedoes were then in vogue, but skyrockets and more elaborate\r\nfireworks had not then come into general use. I do not recall that the\r\nnational flag was especially prominent upon the \"glorious fourth,\" and\r\nit is my impression that this insignia of patriotism was not universally\r\ndisplayed upon patriotic occasions until the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe musical world of New York lay dormant until about the year 1825,\r\nwhen Dominick Lynch, much to the delight of the cultivated classes,\r\nintroduced the Italian Opera. Through his instrumentality Madame\r\nMalibran, her father, Signor Garcia, and her brother, Manuel Garcia, who\r\nby the way died abroad in 1906, nearly ninety-nine years of age, came to\r\nthis country and remained for quite a period. I have heard many sad\r\ntraditions regarding Malibran, whose name is certainly immortal in the\r\nannals of the musical world. Mr. Lynch was the social leader of his day\r\nin New York, was æsthetic in his tastes, and possessed a highly\r\ncultivated voice. He frequently sang the beautiful old ballads so much\r\nin vogue at that period. I have heard through Mrs. Samuel L. Hinckley,\r\nan old friend of mine, who remembered the incident, that during a visit\r\nto Boston when he sang Tom Moore's pathetic ballad, \"Oft in the Stilly\r\nNight,\" there was scarcely a dry eye in the room. In referring to the\r\nintroduction of the Italian Opera into this country Dr. John W. Francis\r\nin his \"Old New York\" thus speaks of Dominick Lynch: \"For this\r\nadvantageous accession to the resources of mental gratification, we were\r\nindebted to the taste and refinement of Dominick Lynch, the liberality\r\nof the manager of the Park Theater, Stephen Price, and the distinguished\r\nreputation of the Venetian, Lorenzo Da Ponte. Lynch, a native of New\r\nYork, was the acknowledged head of the fashionable and festive board, a\r\ngentleman of the ton and a melodist of great powers and of exquisite\r\ntaste; he had long striven to enhance the character of our music; he was\r\nthe master of English song, but he felt, from his close cultivation of\r\nmusic and his knowledge of the genius of his countrymen, that much was\r\nwanting, and that more could be accomplished, and he sought out, while\r\nin Europe, an Italian _troupe_, which his persuasive eloquence and the\r\nliberal spirit of Price led to embark for our shores where they arrived\r\nin November, 1825.\" Stephen Price here referred to by Dr. Francis was\r\nthe manager of the old Park Theater. Dominick Lynch's grandson, Nicholas\r\nLuquer, who with his charming wife, formerly Miss Helen K. Shelton of\r\nNew York, resides in Washington, and his son, Lynch Luquer, inherit the\r\nmusical ability of their ancestor.\r\n\r\nThe great actors of the day performed in the Park Theater. I also\r\nvividly remember the Bowery Theater, as well as in subsequent years\r\nBurton's Theater in Chambers Street and the Astor Place Theater. When\r\nWilliam C. Macready, the great English actor, was performing in the\r\nlatter in 1849 a riot occurred caused by the jealousy existing between\r\nhim and his American rival, Edwin Forrest. Forrest had not been well\r\nreceived in England owing, as he believed, to the unfriendly influence\r\nof Macready. While the latter was considered by many the better actor,\r\nForrest was exceptionally popular with a certain class of people in New\r\nYork whose sympathies were easily enlisted and whose passions were\r\nreadily aroused. During the evening referred to, while Macready was\r\nacting in the _rôle_ of Macbeth, a determined mob attacked the theater,\r\nand the riot was not quelled until after a bitter struggle, in which the\r\npolice and the military were engaged, and during which twenty-one were\r\nkilled and thirty-three wounded.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this unfortunate rivalry and its bloody results,\r\nForrest became morbid, and his domestic infelicities that followed\r\nserved to still further embitter his life. In 1850 his wife instituted\r\nproceedings for divorce in the Superior Court of the City of New York,\r\nand the trial was protracted for two years. She was represented by the\r\neminent jurist, Charles O'Conor, while Forrest employed \"Prince\" John\r\nVan Buren, son of the ex-President. The legal struggle was one of the\r\nmost celebrated in the annals of the New York bar. There was abundant\r\nevidence of moral delinquency on the part of both parties to the suit,\r\nbut the verdict was in favor of Mrs. Forrest. She was the daughter of\r\nJohn Sinclair, formerly a drummer in the English army and subsequently a\r\nprofessional singer. James Gordon Bennett said of her in the _Herald_\r\nthat \"being born and schooled in turmoil and dissipation and reared in\r\nconstant excitement she could not live without it.\"\r\n\r\nI have heard it said that one day John Van Buren was asked by a\r\ndisgruntled friend at the close of a hotly contested suit whether there\r\nwas any case so vile or disreputable that he would refuse to act as\r\ncounsel for the accused. The quick response was: \"I must first know the\r\ncircumstances of the case; but what have you been doing?\" Dr. Valentine\r\nMott, who for many years was a resident of Paris, gave a fancy-dress\r\nball in New York in honor of the Prince de Joinville, son of Louis\r\nPhilippe. At this entertainment John Van Buren appeared in the usual\r\nevening dress with a red sash tied around his waist. Much to the\r\namusement of the guests whom he met, his salutation was: \"Would you know\r\nme?\" It will be remembered that he was familiarly called \"Prince John,\"\r\nowing to the fact that he had once danced with Queen Victoria prior to\r\nher ascension to the throne. One day Van Buren met on the street James\r\nT. Brady, a lawyer of equal ability and wit, who had recently returned\r\nfrom a visit to England. In a most patronizing manner he inquired\r\nwhether he had seen the Queen. \"Certainly,\" said Mr. Brady, \"and under\r\nthese circumstances. I was walking along the street when by chance the\r\nQueen's carriage overtook me, and the moment Her Majesty's eye lighted\r\nupon me she exclaimed: 'Hello, Jim Brady, when did you hear from John\r\nVan Buren?'\" I recall another amusing anecdote about John Van Buren\r\nduring my school days. Mustaches were at that time worn chiefly by the\r\nsporting element. Mr. Van Buren, who was very attentive to Catharine\r\nTheodora Duer, a daughter of President William Alexander Duer of\r\nColumbia College, and who, by the way, never married, adopted this style\r\nof facial adornment, but the young woman objecting to it he cut it off\r\nand sent it to her in a letter. Prince John Van Buren's daughter, Miss\r\nAnna Vander Poel Van Buren, many years thereafter, married Edward\r\nAlexander Duer, a nephew of this Catharine Theodora Duer.\r\n\r\nIt was my very great pleasure to know Fanny Kemble and her father,\r\nCharles Kemble. She was, indeed, the queen of tragedy, and delighted the\r\nhistrionic world of New York by her remarkable rendering of the plays of\r\nShakespeare. In later years when I heard her give Shakespearian\r\nreadings, I regarded the occasion as an epoch in my life. In this\r\nconnection I venture to express my surprise that the classical English\r\nquotations so pleasing to the ear in former days are now so seldom\r\nheard. It seems unfortunate that the epigrammatic sentences, for\r\nexample, of grand old Dr. Samuel Johnson have become almost obsolete. In\r\nformer years Byron appealed to the sentiment, while the more ambitious\r\nquoted Greek maxims. The sayings of the old authors were recalled,\r\nmingled with the current topics of the day. It would seem, however, that\r\nthe present generation is decidedly more interested in quotations from\r\nthe stock exchange. Edmund Burke said that \"the age of chivalry is\r\ngone, that of sophists, economists, and calculators has succeeded.\"\r\n\r\nUpon her return to England Fanny Kemble published her journal kept while\r\nin the United States, which was by no means pleasing in every respect to\r\nher American readers. It is said that in one of her literary effusions\r\nshe dwelt upon a custom, which she claimed was prevalent in America, of\r\nparents naming their children after classical heroes, and gave as an\r\nexample a child in New York who bore the name of Alfonzo Alonzo\r\nAgamemnon Dionysius Bogardus. The sister of this youth, she stated, was\r\nnamed Clementina Seraphina Imogen. I think this statement must have been\r\nevolved from her own brain, as it would be difficult to conceive of\r\nparents who would consent to make their children notorious in such a\r\nridiculous manner. Fanny Kemble married Pierce Butler, a lawyer of\r\nability and cousin of the U.S. Senator from South Carolina of the same\r\nname, and they were divorced in 1849, when the Hon. George M. Dallas was\r\ncounsel for Fanny Kemble and Rufus Choate appeared for her husband.\r\n\r\nFanny Elssler, a queen of grace and beauty on the stage, delighted\r\nimmense audiences at the Park Theater. She came to this country under\r\nthe auspices of Chevalier Henry Wikoff, a roving but accomplished\r\nsoldier of fortune, who pitched his camp in both continents. Upon her\r\narrival in New York the \"divine Fanny,\" as she was invariably called,\r\nwas borne to her destination in a carriage from which the horses had\r\nbeen detached by her enthusiastic _adorateurs_, led by August Belmont.\r\nShe was, indeed,\r\n\r\n    A being so fair that the same lips and eyes\r\n    She bore on earth might serve in Paradise.\r\n\r\nAt this distant day it seems almost impossible to describe her. She\r\nseemed to float upon the stage sustained only by the surrounding\r\natmosphere. In my opinion she has never had a rival, with the possible\r\nexception of Taglioni, the great Swedish _danseuse_. I saw Fanny Elssler\r\ndance the _cracovienne_ and the _cachucha_, and it is a memory which\r\nwill linger with me always. The music that accompanied these dances was\r\ngenerally selected from the popular airs of the day. Many dark stories\r\nwere afloat concerning Fanny Elssler's private life, but to me it seems\r\nimpossible to associate her angelic presence with anything but her\r\nwonderful art. She was never received socially in New York; indeed, the\r\nonly person that I remember connected with the stage in my early days\r\nwho had the social _entrée_ was Fanny Kemble.\r\n\r\nWe attended the Dutch Reformed Church in New York of which the Rev. Dr.\r\nJacob Brodhead was for many years the pastor. My aunts, however,\r\nattended one of the three collegiate churches in the lower part of the\r\ncity, and I sometimes accompanied them and, as there was a frequent\r\ninterchange of pulpits, I became quite accustomed to hear all of the\r\nthree clergymen. The Rev. Dr. John Knox, who endeared himself to his\r\nflock by his gentle and appealing ministrations; the Rev. Dr. Thomas De\r\nWitt, a profound theologian and courtly gentleman; and the Rev. Dr.\r\nWilliam C. Brownlee, with his vigorous Scotch accent, preaching against\r\nwhat he invariably called \"papery\" (popery), and recalling, as he did,\r\nJohn Knox of old, that irritating thorn in the side of the unfortunate\r\nMary Queen of Scots, made up this remarkable trio. During the latter\r\npart of his life Dr. Brownlee suffered from a stroke of paralysis which\r\nrendered him speechless, and his Catholic adversaries improved this\r\nopportunity to circulate the report that he had been visited by a\r\njudgment from Heaven.\r\n\r\nThere were many shining lights in the Episcopal Church at this time in\r\nNew York. The Rev. Dr. William Berrian was the acceptable rector of St.\r\nJohn's, which was then as now a chapel of Trinity Parish. The Rev. Dr.\r\nFrancis L. Hawks was the popular rector of St. Thomas's church, on the\r\ncorner of Broadway and Houston Streets. He was a North Carolinian by\r\nbirth, but is said to have been in part of Indian descent. I recall with\r\npleasure his masterly rendition of the Episcopal service. During the\r\nCivil War he made it quite apparent to his parishioners that his\r\nsympathies were with the South, and as most of them did not share his\r\nviews he moved to Baltimore, where a more congenial atmosphere\r\nsurrounded him.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Stephen H. Tyng, senior, was the rector of St. George's\r\nEpiscopal church in the lower part of the city. He was a theologian of\r\nthe Low-Church school and was greatly esteemed by all of his colleagues.\r\nHis son, the Rev. Dr. Stephen H. Tyng, junior, was in full sympathy with\r\nthe Low-Church views of his father, and will be recalled as an\r\nevangelical preacher of exceptional power and wide influence. In the\r\nsummer of 1867 he preached, in defiance of the canons of the Episcopal\r\nChurch, in St. James's Methodist church in New Brunswick, N.J., thus\r\ninvading without authority the parishes of the Rev. Dr. Alfred Stubs and\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Edward B. Boggs of that city. His trial was of sensational\r\ninterest, and resulted, as will be remembered, in his conviction. The\r\nattitude of the Tyngs, father and son, was humorously described by\r\nAnthony Bleecker, a well-known wit of the day, in these verses:\r\n\r\n    _Tyng, Junior._\r\n\r\n    I preach from barrels and from tubs,\r\n    In spite of Boggs, in spite of Stubs;\r\n    I'll preach from stumps, I'll preach from logs,\r\n    In spite of Stubs, in spite of Boggs.\r\n\r\n    _Tyng, Senior._\r\n\r\n    Do, Steve; and lay aside your gown,\r\n    Your bands and surplice throw them down;\r\n    A bob-tail coat of tweed or kersey\r\n    Is good enough at least for Jersey.\r\n\r\n    _Tyng, Junior._\r\n\r\n    What if the Bishops interfere,\r\n    And I am made a culprit clear;\r\n    Can't you a thunderbolt then forge,\r\n    And hurl it in the new St. George?\r\n\r\n    _Tyng, Senior._\r\n\r\n    Be sure I can and out of spite\r\n    A wrathy sermon I'll indite;\r\n    I'll score the court and every judge\r\n    And call the whole proceedings fudge;\r\n    And worse than that each reverent name\r\n    I'll bellow through the trump of fame;\r\n    With Bishop Potter I'll get even,\r\n    And make you out the martyr Stephen.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Orville Dewey, renowned for his intellectual attainments,\r\npreached in the Unitarian church in Mercer Street. In subsequent years\r\nhis sermons were published and I understand are still read with much\r\ninterest and pleasure. Archbishop John Hughes, whom I knew quite well,\r\nwas the controlling power in the Roman Catholic Church. He possessed the\r\naffectionate regard of the whole community, and naturally commanded a\r\nwide influence. A Roman Catholic told me many years ago that, upon one\r\nof the visits of the Archbishop to St. Peter's church, he took the\r\ncongregation to task for their exclusiveness, exclaiming: \"You lock up\r\nyour pews and exclude the marrow of the land.\"\r\n\r\nI knew very well the Rev. Charles Constantine Pise, the first\r\nnative-born Catholic to officiate in St. Joseph's church on Sixth\r\nAvenue. He was of Italian parentage and was remarkable for his great\r\nphysical attractiveness. In addition to his fine appearance, he was\r\nexceedingly social in his tastes and was consequently a highly agreeable\r\nguest. He cultivated the muses to a modest degree, and I have several of\r\nhis poetical effusions, one of which was addressed to me. In spite of\r\nthe admiration he commanded from both men and women, irrespective of\r\ncreed, life seemed to present to him but few allurements. Archbishop\r\nHughes sent him to a small Long Island parish where, after laboring long\r\nand earnestly, he closed his earthly career. An anecdote is related of\r\nthis pious man which I believe to be true. A young woman quite forgetful\r\nof the proprieties and conventionalties of life, but with decided\r\nmatrimonial proclivities, made Father Pise an offer of her fortune,\r\nheart and hand. In a dignified manner he advised her to give her heart\r\nto God, her money to the poor, and her hand to the man who asked for it.\r\nPrior to his rectorship of St. Joseph's church in New York, Father Pise,\r\nwho was an intimate friend of Henry Clay, served as Chaplain of the U.S.\r\nSenate during a portion of the 22d Congress. At the National Capital as\r\nwell as in New York he was exceptionally popular, making many converts,\r\nespecially among young women, and preaching to congregations in churches\r\nso densely crowded that it was difficult to obtain even standing room.\r\n\r\nI cannot pass the Roman Catholic clergy without some reference to the\r\nRev. Felix Varela, a priest of Spanish descent and, it is said, of noble\r\nbirth, who was sent from Cuba to Spain as one of the deputies to the\r\nCortes from his native island. His church was St. Peter's in Barclay\r\nStreet. It would be difficult for any words to do justice to his life of\r\nself-abnegation or to his adherence to the precepts of his Divine\r\nMaster. It is with pleasure, therefore, that I relate the following\r\nstory, for the truth of which I can vouch. A policeman found a handsome\r\npair of silver candlesticks in the custody of a poor unfortunate man,\r\nand as they bore upon them a distinctive coat of arms he arrested him.\r\nOn his way to prison the suspected criminal begged to see Father Varela\r\nfor a moment, and as his residence was _en route_ to the station house\r\nthe officer granted his request. This good priest informed the policeman\r\nwith much reluctance that the candlesticks had formerly belonged to\r\nhim, and that he had given them to his prisoner to buy bread for his\r\nfamily. My father was so deeply in sympathy with the life and character\r\nof this priest that, although of a different faith, he seldom heard his\r\nname mentioned without an expression of admiration for his life and\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThere was a French Protestant church in Franklin Street ministered to by\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Antoine Verren, whose wife was a daughter of Thomas\r\nHammersley. I also remember very well a Presbyterian church on Laight\r\nStreet, opposite St. John's Park, the rector of which was the Rev. Dr.\r\nSamuel H. Cox, an uncle of the late Bishop Arthur Cleveland Cox of the\r\nEpiscopal Church. Dr. Cox was a prominent abolitionist, and when we were\r\nliving on Hubert Street, just around the corner, this church was stoned\r\nby a mob because the rector had expressed his anti-slavery views too\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\nThe mode of conducting funerals in former days in New York differed very\r\nmaterially from the customs now in vogue. While the coffins of the\r\nwell-to-do were made entirely of mahogany and without handles, I have\r\nalways understood that persons of the Hebrew faith buried their dead in\r\npine coffins, as they believed this wood to be more durable.\r\nPall-bearers wore white linen scarfs three yards long with a rosette of\r\nthe same material fastened on one shoulder, which, together with a pair\r\nof black gloves, was always presented by the family. It was originally\r\nthe intention that the linen scarf should be used after the funeral for\r\nmaking a shirt. Funerals from churches were not as customary as at the\r\npresent time. If the body was to be interred within the city limits\r\nevery one attending the services, including the family, walked to the\r\ncemetery. It was unusual for a woman to be seen at a funeral.\r\n\r\nBut the whole social tone of New York society was more _de rigueur_ than\r\nnow. Sometimes, for example, persons living under a cloud of\r\ninsufficient magnitude to place them behind prison bars, feeling their\r\ndisgrace, took flight for Texas. Instead of placing the conventional\r\n_P.P.C._ on their cards the letters _G.T.T._ were used, meaning that the\r\nself-expatriated ne'er-do-well had \"gone to Texas.\" I have always\r\nunderstood that in Great Britain the transgressor sought the Continent,\r\nwhere he was often enabled to pass into oblivion. In this manner both\r\ncountries were relieved of patriots who \"left their country for their\r\ncountry's good.\" As an example, I remember hearing in my early life of\r\nan Englishman named de Roos, who had the unfortunate habit of arranging\r\ncards to suit his own fancy. When his _confrères_ finally caught him in\r\nthe act he left hurriedly for the Continent.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 the U.S. sloop of war _Somers_ arrived in New York, and the\r\ncountry was startled by the accounts of what has since been known as the\r\n\"Somers Mutiny.\" The Captain of the ship was Commander Alexander Slidell\r\nMackenzie, whose original surname was Slidell. He was a brother of the\r\nHon. John Slidell, at one time U.S. Senator from Louisiana, who, during\r\nthe Civil War, while on his passage to England on the _Trent_ as a\r\nrepresentative of the Southern Confederacy in England, was captured by\r\nCaptain Charles Wilkes of the U.S. Navy. The result of the alleged\r\nmutiny was the execution, by hanging at the yard arm, of Philip Spencer,\r\na son of the celebrated New York lawyer, John C. Spencer, President\r\nTyler's Secretary of War, and of two sailors, Samuel Cromwell and Elisha\r\nSmall. It was charged that they had conspired to capture the ship and\r\nset adrift or murder her officers. Being far from any home port, and\r\nuncertain of the extent to which the spirit of disaffection had\r\npermeated the crew, Mackenzie consulted the officers of his ship as to\r\nthe proper course for him to pursue. In accordance with their advice,\r\nand after only a preliminary examination of witnesses and no formal\r\ntrial with testimony for the defense, they were, as just stated,\r\nsummarily executed.\r\n\r\nI speak from the point of view of the legal element of New York, as my\r\nfather's associates were nearly all professional men. The world was\r\naghast upon receiving the news that three men had been hurled into\r\neternity without judge or jury. Spencer was a lad of less than nineteen\r\nand a midshipman. Although Captain Mackenzie's action was sustained by\r\nthe court of inquiry, which was convened in his case, as well as by the\r\n_esprit de corps_ of the Navy, public feeling ran so high that a court\r\nmartial was ordered. His trial of two months' duration took place at the\r\nBrooklyn Navy Yard, and resulted in a verdict of \"not proven.\" The\r\njudge-advocate of the court was Mr. William H. Norris of Baltimore, and\r\nMackenzie was defended by Mr. George Griffith and Mr. John Duer, the\r\nlatter of whom was the distinguished New York jurist and the uncle of\r\nCaptain Mackenzie's wife. At the request of the Hon. John C. Spencer,\r\nBenjamin F. Butler and Charles O'Conor, leaders of the New York bar,\r\nformally applied for permission to ask questions approved by the court\r\nand to offer testimony, but the request was refused--\"so that,\" as\r\nThomas H. Benton expressed it, \"at the long _post mortem_ trial which\r\nwas given to the boy after his death, the father was not allowed to ask\r\none question in favor of his son.\" After a lapse of sixty-nine years,\r\njudging from Mackenzie's report to the Navy Department, it almost seems\r\nas if he possessed a touch of mediæval superstition. He speaks of\r\nSpencer giving money and tobacco to the crew, of his being extremely\r\nintimate with them, that he had a strange flashing of the eye, and\r\nfinally that he was in the habit of amusing the sailors by making music\r\nwith his jaws. Mackenzie in his official report stated that this lad\r\n\"had the faculty of throwing his jaw out of joint and by contact of the\r\nbones playing with accuracy and elegance a variety of airs.\" James\r\nFenimore Cooper stated it as his opinion, \"that such was the obliquity\r\nof intellect shown by Mackenzie in the whole affair, that no analysis\r\nof his motives can be made on any consistent principle of human action;\"\r\nand the distinguished statesman, Thomas H. Benton, whose critical and\r\nlengthy review of the whole case would seem to carry conviction to\r\nunprejudiced minds, declared that the three men \"died innocent, as\r\nhistory will tell and show.\"\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the Mackenzie trial were eagerly read by an\r\ninterested public. As I remember the testimony given regarding Spencer's\r\nlast moments upon earth, Mackenzie announced to the youthful culprit\r\nthat he had but ten minutes to live. He fell at once upon his knees and\r\nexclaimed that he was not fit to die, and the Captain replied that he\r\nwas aware of the fact, but could not help it. It is recorded that he\r\nread his Bible and Prayer-Book, and that the Captain referred him to the\r\n\"penitent thief;\" but when he pleaded that his fate would kill his\r\nmother and injure his father, Mackenzie made the inconsiderate reply\r\nthat the best and only service he could render his father was to die.\r\n\r\nI recall a conversation bearing upon the _Somers_ tragedy which I\r\noverheard between my father and his early friend, Thomas Morris, when\r\ntheir indignation was boundless. The latter's son, Lieutenant Charles W.\r\nMorris, U.S.N., had made several cruises with the alleged mutineer\r\nCromwell. Meeting Mackenzie he stated this fact, saying at the same time\r\nthat he found him a well-disposed and capable seaman. Mackenzie quickly\r\nresponded that \"he had a bad eye,\" and then Lieutenant Morris recalled\r\nthat the unfortunate man had a cast in one eye.\r\n\r\nA few years after his court-martial Mackenzie fell dead from his horse.\r\nOne of the wardroom officers of the _Somers_ was Adrian Déslonde of\r\nLouisiana, whose sister married the Hon. John Slidell, of whom I have\r\nalready spoken as Commander Mackenzie's brother.\r\n\r\nI seldom hear the name of John Slidell without being reminded of a\r\nwitticism which I heard from my mother's lips, the author of which was\r\nLouisa Fairlie, a daughter of Major James Fairlie, who, during the War\r\nof the Revolution, served upon General Steuben's staff. She was, I have\r\nunderstood, a great belle with a power of repartee which bordered upon\r\ngenius. During the youth of John Slidell he attended a dinner at a\r\nprominent New York residence and sat at the table next to Miss Fairlie.\r\nIn a tactless manner he made a pointedly unpleasant remark bearing upon\r\nthe marriage of her sister Mary to the distinguished actor, Thomas\r\nApthorpe Cooper, a subject upon which the Fairlie family was somewhat\r\nsensitive. Miss Fairlie regarded Mr. Slidell for only a moment, and then\r\nretorted: \"Sir, you have been _dipped_ not _moulded_ into society\"--an\r\nincident which, by the way, I heard repeated many years later at a\r\ndinner in China. To appreciate this witticism, one may refer to the New\r\nYork directory of 1789, which describes John Slidell, the father of the\r\nSlidell of whom we are speaking, as \"soap boiler and chandler, 104\r\nBroadway.\" Miss Fairlie's pun seems to me to be quite equal to that of\r\nRufus Choate, who, when a certain Baptist minister described himself as\r\n\"a candle of the Lord,\" remarked, \"Then you are a dipped, but I hope not\r\na wick-ed candle.\" It is said that upon another occasion, after the\r\nreturn of Mr. Slidell from a foreign trip, he was asked by Miss Fairlie\r\nwhether he had been to Greece. He replied in the negative and asked the\r\nreason for her query. \"Oh, nothing,\" she said, \"only it would have been\r\nvery natural for you to visit Greece in order to renew early\r\nassociations!\" Many years thereafter Priscilla Cooper, the wife of\r\nRobert Tyler and the daughter-in-law of President John Tyler, a daughter\r\nof Thomas Apthorpe Cooper and his wife, Mary Fairlie, presided at the\r\nWhite House during the widowhood of her distinguished father-in-law.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the father of the Hon. John Slidell was a\r\nchandler, and he conducted his business with such success that in time\r\nhe became prominent in mercantile and financial circles, and eventually\r\nwas made president of the Mechanics Bank and the Tradesmen's Insurance\r\nCompany. His son John, who at first engaged in his father's soap and\r\ntallow business as an apprentice, finally succeeded him, and the\r\nenterprise was continued under the firm name of \"John Slidell, Jr. and\r\nCompany.\" The house failed, however, and it is said that this fact,\r\ntogether with the scandal attending his duel with Stephen Price, manager\r\nof the Park Theater, in which the latter was wounded, were the\r\ncontrolling factors that led the future Hon. John Slidell to remove his\r\nresidence to New Orleans. In this place he became highly celebrated as a\r\nlawyer, and his successful political career is well known. He married\r\nMiss Marie Mathilde Déslonde, a member of a well-known Creole family,\r\nand many persons still living will recall her grace and _savoir faire_\r\nin Washington when her husband represented Louisiana in the United\r\nStates Senate. Miss Jane Slidell, a sister of the Hon. John Slidell,\r\nmarried Commodore Matthew C. Perry, U.S.N., who opened the doors of\r\nJapan to the trade of the world, and whose daughter, Caroline Slidell\r\nPerry, became the wife of the late August Belmont of New York, while\r\nJulia, another of Mr. Slidell's sisters, married the late Rear Admiral\r\nC. R. P. Rodgers, U.S.N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLONG BRANCH, NEWPORT AND ELSEWHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was about ten years of age, accompanied by my parents, I made a\r\nvisit to Long Branch, which was then one of the most fashionable summer\r\nresorts for New Yorkers. As we made the journey by steamboat and the\r\nwater was rough we were the victims of a violent attack of seasickness\r\nfrom which few of the passengers escaped. Many Philadelphians also spent\r\ntheir summers at this resort, and there was naturally a fair sprinkling\r\nof people from other large cities. At that time there were no hotels in\r\nthe place, but there was one commodious boarding house which\r\naccommodated a large number of guests. It bore no name, but was\r\ndesignated as \"Mrs. Sairs',\" from its proprietress. In this\r\nestablishment our whole family, by no means small, found accommodations.\r\nI recall many pleasant acquaintances we made while there, especially\r\nthat of Miss Molly Hamilton of Philadelphia. She was a vivacious old\r\nlady, and was accompanied by her nephew, Hamilton Beckett, in whom I\r\nfound a congenial playmate. His name made a strong impression upon my\r\nmemory, as I was then reading the history of Thomas à Becket, the\r\nmurdered Archbishop of Canterbury. I have heard that this friend of my\r\nchildhood went eventually to England to reside. The Penningtons of\r\nNewark had a cottage near us. William Pennington subsequently became\r\nGovernor of New Jersey. I also enjoyed the youthful companionship of his\r\ndaughter Mary, whom many years later I met in Washington. In the\r\ninterval she had become a pronounced belle and the wife of Hugh A. Toler\r\nof Newark.\r\n\r\nThe guests of the boarding house were inclined to complain that the\r\nbeach was too exclusively appropriated by two acquaintances of ours who\r\nwere living in the same house with us, Mrs. G. W. Featherstonhaugh and\r\nMrs. Thomas M. Willing, and their train of admirers. They were sprightly\r\nyoung women and daughters of Bernard Moore Carter of Virginia. I\r\nremember it was the gossip of the place that both of them could count\r\ntheir offers of marriage by the score. Mrs. Willing was a skilled\r\nperformer upon the harp, an instrument then much in vogue, but whose\r\nsilvery tones are now, alas, only memory's echo. Mr. Featherstonhaugh,\r\nwho was by birth an Englishman, after residing in the United States a\r\nfew years, wrote in 1847 a book entitled \"Excursion through the Slave\r\nStates from Washington on the Potomac to the Frontier of Mexico.\" I\r\nrecall that in this volume he spoke with enthusiasm of the _agréments_\r\nof the palate which he enjoyed during a few days' sojourn at Barnum's\r\nHotel in Baltimore. He dwelt particularly, with gastronomic ecstasy,\r\nupon the canvas-back duck and soft-shell crab upon which he feasted, and\r\nwas inclined to draw an unfavorable comparison between the former hotel\r\nand Gadsby's, the well-known Washington hostelry. Upon his journey he\r\nvisited Monticello, the former home of Thomas Jefferson. His encomium on\r\nthis distinguished man appealed to me as I am sure it does to others; he\r\nspoke of him as the \"Confucius of his country.\" Altogether, Mr.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh's experiences in America were as novel and entertaining\r\nas a sojourn with Aborigines.\r\n\r\nJust off the beach at Long Branch was a high bluff which descended\r\ngradually to the sea, and at this point were several primitive bath\r\nhouses belonging to Mrs. Sairs' establishment. Following the prevalent\r\ncustom, we wore no bathing shoes and stockings, but, accompanied by a\r\nstalwart bathing master, we enjoyed many dips in the briny deep, and\r\nwere brought safely back by him to our bath house. There was no\r\nimmodest lingering on the beach; this privilege was reserved for the\r\nadvanced civilization of a later day.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still a young child, and some years after our visit to Long\r\nBranch, my infant brother Malcolm became seriously ill. Dr. John W.\r\nFrancis, our family physician, prescribed a change of air for him, and\r\nmy parents took him to Newport. We found pleasant accommodations for our\r\nfamily in a fashionable boarding house on Thames Street, the guests of\r\nwhich were composed almost exclusively of Southern families. Newport was\r\nthen in an exceedingly primitive state and I have no recollection of\r\nseeing either cottages or hotels, while modern improvements were\r\nunknown. We led a simple outdoor life, taking our breakfast at eight,\r\ndining at two and supping at six. It was indeed \"early to bed and early\r\nto rise.\"\r\n\r\nAs I recall these early days in Newport, two fascinating old ladies,\r\ntypical Southern gentlewomen, the Misses Philippa and Hetty Minus of\r\nSavannah, present themselves vividly to my memory. After we returned to\r\nour New York home we had the pleasure of meeting them again and\r\nentertaining them. Another charming guest of our establishment was the\r\nwife of James L. Pettigru, an eminent citizen of South Carolina. She was\r\nthe first woman of fashion presented to my girlish vision, and her mode\r\nof life was a revelation. She kept very late hours, often lingering in\r\nher room the next morning until midday. As I was then familiar with Miss\r\nEdgeworth's books for young people, which all judicious parents\r\npurchased for their children, I immediately designated Mrs. Pettigru as\r\n\"Lady Delacour,\" whose habits and fashions are so pleasingly described\r\nin that admirable novel, \"Belinda.\" Although born and bred in South\r\nCarolina, Mr. Pettigru remained loyal to the Union, and after his death\r\nhis valuable library was purchased by Congress. The members of another\r\nrepresentative South Carolina family, the Allstons, were also among our\r\nfellow boarders at Long Branch. This name always brings to mind the\r\npathetic history of Theodosia Burr, Aaron Burr's only child, and her sad\r\ndeath; while the name of Washington Allston, the artist, is too well\r\nknown to be dwelt upon.\r\n\r\nAfter a month's pleasant sojourn in Newport my brother's health had\r\nmaterially improved and we returned to our New York home by the way of\r\nBoston, where we were guests at the Tremont House. I blush to\r\nacknowledge to the Bostonians who may peruse these pages that my chief\r\nrecollection of this visit is that I was standing on the steps of the\r\nhotel, when I was accosted by a gentleman, who exclaimed: \"You are a\r\nCampbell, I'll bet ten thousand dollars!\" I apologize for writing such a\r\npersonal reminiscence of such an historic town, but such are the freaks\r\nof memory. This was prior to the maturer days of William Lloyd Garrison,\r\nWendell Phillips and Ralph Waldo Emerson.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to other subjects I must not omit mentioning that at\r\nthis period the currency used in the New England States differed from\r\nthat of New York. This fact was brought vividly before me in Newport\r\nwhen I made an outlay of a shilling at a candy store. In return for my\r\nMexican quarter of a dollar I was handed a small amount of change. I\r\nleft the shop fully convinced that I was a victim of sharp practice, but\r\nlearned later that there was a slight difference between the shilling\r\nused in New York and that used in New England.\r\n\r\nMany years later I visited Boston again, this time as the guest of Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Robert C. Winthrop at their superb Brookline home; and,\r\nescorted by Mr. Winthrop and Mr. and Mrs. Jabez L. M. Curry of Alabama,\r\nwho were also their house-guests, I visited all the points of historical\r\ninterest. Both Mr. Winthrop and Mr. Curry were then trustees of the\r\nPeabody Fund. A few years after we separated in Boston Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCurry went to Spain to reside, where, as American Minister, he was\r\npresent at the birth of King Alfonso of Spain.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen years later I again visited Newport, but this time I was a\r\nfull-fledged young woman. During my absence a large number of hotels and\r\ncottages had been erected, many of which were occupied by Southern\r\nfamilies who still continued to regard this Rhode Island resort as\r\nalmost exclusively their own. I recall the names of many of them, all of\r\nwhom were conspicuous in social life in the South. Among them were the\r\nMiddletons, whose ancestors were historically prominent; the Pinckneys,\r\ndescended from the illustrious Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, who uttered\r\nthe well-known maxim, \"Millions for defense but not one cent for\r\ntribute;\" the Izards; the Draytons, of South Carolina; and the\r\nHabershams of Georgia. During this visit in Newport I was the guest, at\r\ntheir summer cottage, of my life-long friends, the Misses Mary and\r\nMargaret Gelston, daughters of Maltby Gelston, former President of the\r\nManhattan Bank of New York. Not far from the Gelstons resided what Sam\r\nWeller would call three \"widder women.\" They were sisters, the daughters\r\nof Ralph Izard of Dorchester, S.C., and bore distinguished South\r\nCarolina names; Mrs. Poinsett who had been the wife of Joel Roberts\r\nPoinsett, the well-known statesman and Secretary of War under Van Buren,\r\nMrs. Eustis, the widow of Gen. Abram Eustis, U.S.A., who had served in\r\nthe War of 1812, and Mrs. Thomas Pinckney, whose husband, the nephew of\r\nGeneral Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, had been a wealthy rice planter in\r\nSouth Carolina. The beautiful Christmas flower, the poinsettia, was\r\nnamed in compliment to Mr. Poinsett. These interesting women for many\r\nyears were in the habit of leaving what they called their \"Carolina\"\r\nhome for a summer sojourn at Newport, where their house was one of the\r\nsocial centers of attraction. With their graceful bearing, gentle voices\r\nand cordial manners they were characteristic types of the Southern\r\n_grandes dames_ now so seldom seen. A short distance from my hosts'\r\ncottage lived the daughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who was\r\nalso the widow of Robert Goodloe Harper, a prominent Federalist and a\r\nUnited States Senator during the administrations of Madison and Monroe.\r\nMrs. Harper's sister married Richard Caton of Maryland, whose daughters\r\nmade such distinguished British matrimonial alliances. Her daughter,\r\nEmily Harper, upon whose personality I love to dwell, was from her\r\nearliest childhood endowed with strong religious traits. Her gentle\r\nChristian character exemplified charity to all who were fortunate enough\r\nto come within the radius of her influence. She was in every sense of\r\nthe word a deeply religious woman, and her influence upon those around\r\nher was of the most elevating character.\r\n\r\nI shall always remember with the keenest enjoyment some of the pleasant\r\nteas at this hospitable home of the Harpers in Newport. All sects were\r\nwelcomed, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Hebrews, Unitarians, and I doubt\r\nnot that an equally cordial reception would have awaited Mahommedans or\r\nHindoos. I once heard Miss Harper say that she shared with Chateaubriand\r\nthe ennobling sentiment that the salvation of one soul was of more value\r\nthan the conquest of a kingdom. Naturally the Harper cottage was the\r\nrendezvous for Southerners and its hospitable roof sheltered many\r\nprominent people, especially guests from Maryland. Mr. Maltby Gelston\r\ntold me at the time of this visit that Mrs. Harper was the only child of\r\na Signer then living. It is probable that he spoke from positive\r\nknowledge, as he was an authority upon the subject, having married the\r\ngranddaughter of Philip Livingston, a New York Signer. A few years\r\nlater, when I was married in Washington, D.C., I was deeply gratified\r\nwhen Miss Harper came from Baltimore to attend my wedding. The marked\r\nattentions paid to her by Caleb Cushing, then Attorney-General under\r\nPresident Pierce, were the source of much gossip, but she seemed\r\nentirely indifferent to his devotion. I once heard him express great\r\nannoyance after a trip to Baltimore because he failed to see her on\r\naccount of a headache with which she was said to be suffering, and he\r\ninquired of me in a petulant manner whether headaches were an universal\r\nfeminine malady. Like her mother, she lived to a very advanced age and\r\nwhen she departed this life the world lost one of its saintliest\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nOne of the most attractive cottages in Newport at the time of my second\r\nvisit was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Henry Casimir de Rham of New York. It\r\nwas densely shaded by a number of graceful silver-maple trees. Mr. de\r\nRham was a prosperous merchant of Swiss extraction, whose wife was Miss\r\nMaria Theresa Moore, a member of one of New York's most prominent\r\nfamilies and a niece of Bishop Benjamin Moore of New York.\r\n\r\nThe social leaders of Newport at this period were Mr. and Mrs. Robert\r\nMorgan Gibbes, whose winter home was in New York. Mr. Gibbes, who, by\r\nthe way, was a great-uncle of William Waldorf Astor, was a South\r\nCarolinian by birth and had married Miss Emily Oliver of Paterson, New\r\nJersey. They lived in a handsome house, gave sumptuous entertainments,\r\nand had an interesting family of daughters, several of whom I knew quite\r\nwell. One well-remembered evening I attended a party at their house\r\nwhich was regarded as the social affair of the season. It made a lasting\r\nimpression upon my mind owing to a trivial circumstance which seems\r\nhardly worth relating. It was the first time I had ever seen mottoes\r\nused at entertainments, and at this party they were exceptionally\r\nhandsome. The one which fell to my share, and which I treasured for some\r\ntime, bore upon it a large bunch of red currants. These favors were\r\nalways imported, and a few years later became so fashionable that no\r\ndinner or supper table was regarded as quite the proper thing without\r\nthem. I take it for granted that this custom was the origin of the\r\ngerman favors which in the course of time came into such general use.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 I made a third visit to Newport as the guest of Mrs. Winfield\r\nScott. General Scott's headquarters were then in Washington, but, as his\r\nmilitary views were widely divergent from those of Jefferson Davis,\r\nPresident Pierce's Secretary of War, he was urging the President to\r\ntransfer him to New York. I have frequently heard the General jocosely\r\nremark that he longed for a Secretary of War who would not \"make him\r\ncry.\" The Scotts at this period were spending their winters in\r\nWashington and their summers in Newport. Meanwhile his numerous\r\nadmirers, in recognition of his distinguished services, presented him\r\nwith a house on West Twelfth Street which was occupied by him and his\r\nfamily after his transfer to New York. The principal donor of this\r\nresidence was the Hon. Hamilton Fish.\r\n\r\nAfter a charming sojourn of several weeks in Newport, I was about\r\nreturning to my home when I casually invited General Scott's youngest\r\ndaughter, Marcella (\"Ella\"), then only a schoolgirl, to accompany me to\r\nMiss Harper's cottage, as I wished to say good-bye. Upon entering the\r\ndrawing-room a cousin and guest of Miss Harper's, Charles Carroll\r\nMcTavish of Howard County, Maryland, appeared upon the threshold and was\r\nintroduced to us. He was then approaching middle life and I learned\r\nlater that he had served some years in the Russian Army. Marcella\r\nScott's appearance apparently fascinated him from the moment they met,\r\nand from that day he began to be devotedly attentive to her. Mrs. Scott,\r\nhowever, entirely disapproved of Mr. McTavish's attentions to her\r\ndaughter on account of her extreme youth. A few months later Marcella\r\nreturned to Madame Chegaray's school, where she became a boarding pupil\r\nand was not allowed to see visitors. The following winter she was taken\r\nill with typhoid fever, and, when convalescent enough to be moved, was\r\nbrought to my home in Houston Street, New York, to recuperate, as the\r\nScotts were still living in Washington and the journey was considered\r\ntoo long and arduous to be taken by an invalid. Meanwhile, Mr. McTavish\r\nrenewed his attentions to Miss Scott and the impression made was more\r\nthan a passing fancy for in the following June they were married in the\r\nTwelfth Street house of which I have already spoken, General Scott\r\nhaving in the interim succeeded in having his headquarters removed to\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of being present at this wedding, which, in spite of\r\na warm day in June and the many absentees from the city, was one of\r\nexceptional brilliancy. The Army and Navy were well represented, the\r\nofficers of both branches of the service appearing in full-dress\r\nuniform. The hour appointed for the ceremony was high noon, but an\r\namusing _contretemps_ blocked the way. An incorrigible mantua-maker,\r\nfaithless to all promises and regardless of every sense of propriety,\r\nfailed to send home the bridal dress at the appointed time. This state\r\nof affairs proved decidedly embarrassing, but the guests were informed\r\nof the cause of the delay and patiently awaited developments. Behind the\r\nscenes, however, quite a different spectacle was presented, while amid\r\nmuch bustle and excitement a second wedding gown was being hurriedly\r\nprepared. After an hour's delay, however, the belated garment arrived,\r\nwhen the bride-elect was quickly dressed and walked into the large\r\ndrawing-room in all of her bridal finery, leaning, as was then the\r\ncustom, upon the arm of the groom. Archbishop Hughes conducted the\r\nwedding service, and seized upon the auspicious occasion to make an\r\naddress of some length. Previous to the ceremony, my intimate friend,\r\nthe young bride's older sister, Cornelia Scott, who a few years\r\nprevious had become while in Rome a convert to Catholicism, asked me\r\nwith much earnestness of manner to do my best to entertain the\r\nArchbishop, as she thought, in her kind way, that he might be somewhat\r\nout of his element when surrounded by such a large and fashionable\r\nassemblage. This was, indeed, a pleasing task, as it enabled me to renew\r\nmy earlier acquaintance with this gifted prelate. The only member of the\r\ngroom's family present at this ceremony was his handsome brother,\r\nAlexander S. McTavish, who came from Baltimore for the occasion. Strange\r\nto say, in view of the many presents usually displayed upon such\r\noccasions nowadays, I do not remember, although I was a family guest,\r\nseeing or hearing of a single bridal gift, but some of the wedding\r\nguests I recall very distinctly. Among them were Mr. and Mrs. Charles\r\nKing, the former of whom was President of Columbia College and an\r\nintimate friend of General Scott's; Mr. and Mrs. Robert Ray, whose\r\ndaughter Cornelia married Major Schuyler Hamilton, aide-de-camp to\r\nGeneral Scott during the Mexican war; Prof. Clement C. Moore and his\r\ndaughter Theresa; Mr. and Mrs. Edward Mayo of Elizabeth, N.J., the\r\nformer of whom was Mrs. Scott's brother; Mrs. Robert Henry Cabell, a\r\nsister of Mrs. Scott's from Richmond; Major Thomas Williams, an aide to\r\nGeneral Scott, who was killed during the Civil War; and Major Henry L.\r\nScott, aide and son-in-law of General Scott.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, after the wedding guests had departed and quiet again\r\nreigned supreme in the household, I went to Mrs. Scott's room to sit\r\nwith her, as she seemed sad and lonely, and at the same time to talk\r\nover with her, womanlike, the events of the day. In our quiet\r\nconversation I remember referring to Archbishop Hughes's address to the\r\ngroom, and asked her if she had observed that he had dwelt upon the\r\nbride \"being taken from an affectionate father,\" while the remaining\r\nmembers of the family were entirely ignored. Mrs. Scott immediately\r\nbristled up and with much warmth of feeling said that she had noticed\r\nthe omission and believed that the action of the Archbishop was\r\npremeditated. Just here was an undercurrent which as an intimate friend\r\nof the family I fully understood. After Virginia Scott's death at the\r\nGeorgetown Convent Mrs. Scott was most outspoken in her denunciation of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church, which she felt had robbed her of her\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nSome years after his marriage Charles Carroll McTavish applied to the\r\nLegislature of Maryland for permission to drop his surname and to assume\r\nthat of his great-grandfather, Charles Carroll. As this request was\r\nstrenuously opposed by other descendants of the Signer, who regarded it\r\nas inexpedient to increase the number of Charles Carrolls, the petition\r\nof Mr. McTavish was not granted. Mary Wellesley McTavish, his sister, I\r\nremember as a sprightly young woman of fine appearance. She made her\r\n_début_ in London society as the guest of her aunt, Mary McTavish, wife\r\nof the Marquis of Wellesley. After a brief courtship she married Henry\r\nGeorge Howard, a son of the Earl of Carlisle, and accompanied him to the\r\nNetherlands, where he was the accredited British Minister. Mrs. George\r\nBancroft, wife of the historian, who accompanied her husband when he was\r\nour Minister to England, gave me an interesting sketch of Mrs. Howard's\r\nvaried life. Death finally claimed her in Paris and her body was brought\r\nback to this country and buried in Maryland, the home of her youth. Her\r\nmother, who brought the remains across the ocean, soon after her\r\nbereavement, established \"The House of the Good Shepherd\" in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThree daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Carroll McTavish grew into\r\nwomanhood. The elder sisters, Mary and Emily, both of whom were well\r\nknown for their beauty and vivacity, entered upon cloistered lives. Just\r\nas the two sisters were about taking this step, they made a request,\r\nwhich caused much comment, to the effect that they should be assigned to\r\ndifferent convents. I understand that Mrs. McTavish, their mother, is\r\nstill living in Rome with the unmarried daughter. During Mrs. Scott's\r\nresidence in Paris she was invited to witness the ceremony of \"taking\r\nthe veil\" at a prominent convent, and writing to her family at home she\r\nremarked: \"How strange that human beings, knowing the fickleness of\r\ntheir natures, should bind themselves for life to one limited space and\r\nunvarying mode of existence.\"\r\n\r\nHoboken, or, as it was sometimes called, Paulus Hook, was a great resort\r\nin my earlier life for residents of the great metropolis. We children,\r\naccompanied by my father or some other grown person, delighted to roam\r\nin that locality over what was most appropriately termed the \"Elysian\r\nFields.\" Professional landscape-gardening had not then been thought of,\r\nbut nature's achievements often surpass the embellishments of man. Our\r\ncup of happiness was full to the brim when we were taken to this\r\nentrancing spot overlooking the Hudson River, with its innumerable\r\nsloops, steamboats and tugs adding so much to the picturesqueness of the\r\nscene. As we strolled along, we regaled ourselves every now and then\r\nwith a refreshing glass of mead, a concoction of honey and cold water,\r\npurchased from a passing vender; and when cakes or candy were added to\r\nthe refreshing drink life seemed very _couleur de rose_ to our childish\r\ndreams. Then again we made occasional trips up the river, but the\r\nsteamboats and other excursion craft of that day were of course mere\r\npigmies compared with those of the present time. The cabin always had a\r\nlarge dining table, on either side of which was a line of berths. Guests\r\nwere called to dinner at one o'clock by the vigorous ringing of a large\r\nbell in the hands of a colored waiter dressed in a white apron and\r\njacket. I have often thought how surprised and pleased this old-time\r\nservant, universally seen in every well-to-do household in those days,\r\nwould be if he could return to earth and hear himself addressed as\r\n\"butler.\"\r\n\r\nIt was upon one of these trips up the Hudson that the widow of General\r\nAlexander Hamilton and her daughter, Mrs. Hamilton Holly, were taking\r\ntheir mid-day repast, at one end of the long table, when they were\r\ninformed that Aaron Burr was partaking of the same meal not far from\r\nthem. Their indignation was boundless, and immediately there were two\r\nvacant chairs. Mrs. Holly was a woman of strong intellect, and a\r\nfriendship which I formed with her is one of the most cherished memories\r\nof my life. She devoted her widowhood to the care of her aged mother. We\r\noften engaged in confidential conversations, when she would discuss the\r\ntragedies which so clouded her life. I especially remember her dwelling\r\nupon the sad history of her sister, Angelica Hamilton, who, she told me,\r\nwas in the bloom of health and surrounded by everything that goes\r\ntowards making life happy when her eldest brother, Philip Hamilton, was\r\nkilled in a duel. He had but recently been graduated from Columbia\r\nCollege and lost his life in 1801 on the same spot where, about three\r\nyears later, his father was killed by Aaron Burr. This dreadful event\r\naffected her so deeply that her mind became unbalanced, and she was\r\nfinally placed in an asylum, where she died at a very advanced age. Mrs.\r\nHamilton lived in Washington, D.C., in one of the De Menou buildings on\r\nH Street, between Thirteenth and Fourteenth Streets, and Mrs. Holly\r\nresided in the same city until her death.\r\n\r\nTragedy seemed to pursue the Hamilton family with unrelenting\r\nperseverance until the third generation. In 1858 the legislature of\r\nVirginia, desiring that every native President should repose upon\r\nVirginia soil, made an appropriation for removing the remains of James\r\nMonroe from New York to Richmond. He died on the 4th of July, 1831,\r\nwhile temporarily residing in New York with his daughter, Mrs. Samuel L.\r\nGouverneur, and his body was placed in the Gouverneur vault in the\r\nMarble Cemetery on Second Street, east of Second Avenue, where it\r\nremained for nearly thirty years. The disinterment of the remains of\r\nthis distinguished statesman was conducted with much pomp and ceremony\r\nand the body placed on board of the steamer _Jamestown_ and conveyed to\r\nRichmond, accompanied all the way by the 7th Regiment of New York which\r\nacted as a guard of honor. The orator of the occasion was John Cochrane,\r\na distinguished member of the New York bar; while Henry A. Wise, then\r\nGovernor of Virginia, delivered an appropriate address at the grave in\r\nHollywood Cemetery in Richmond. My husband, Samuel L. Gouverneur,\r\njunior, Monroe's grandson, accompanied the remains as the representative\r\nof the family. After the ceremonies in Richmond were completed, but\r\nbefore the 7th Regiment had embarked upon its homeward voyage, one of\r\nits members, Laurens Hamilton, a grandson of Alexander Hamilton and a\r\nson of John C. Hamilton, was drowned near Richmond. All the proceedings\r\nconnected with the removal of Mr. Monroe's remains, both in New York and\r\nin Richmond, were published some years later by Udolpho Wolfe, a\r\nneighbor and admirer of the late President. A copy of the book was\r\npresented to each member of the 7th Regiment and one of them was also\r\ngiven by the compiler to my husband. A few years later this same New\r\nYork regiment invaded Virginia, but under greatly different\r\ncircumstances. A terrible civil war was raging, and the Old Dominion for\r\na time was its principal battle ground.\r\n\r\nI recall an amusing anecdote which Mr. Gouverneur told me upon his\r\nreturn from this visit to Richmond. While the great concourse of people\r\nwas still assembled at Monroe's grave in Hollywood Cemetery, Governor\r\nHenry A. Wise, always proud of his State, remarked: \"Now we must have\r\nall the native Presidents of Virginia buried within this inclosure.\"\r\nImmediately a vigorous hand was placed on his shoulder by a New York\r\nalderman who had accompanied the funeral _cortège_, who exclaimed in\r\ncharacteristic Bowery vernacular: \"Go ahead, Governor, you'll fotch\r\n'em.\"\r\n\r\nThe only mode of travel on the Hudson River in my early days was by\r\nboat. One of my recollections is seeing Captain Vanderbilt in command of\r\na steamboat. I have heard older members of my family say that he\r\ndesignated himself \"Captain Wanderbilt,\" and that his faithful wife's\r\nendearing mode of accosting him was \"Corneil.\" At any rate, it is\r\nwell-known that he began life by operating a rowboat ferry between\r\nStaten Island and New York. In later years a sailboat was substituted\r\nover this same route. The Hudson River Railroad was originally built\r\nunder the direction of a number of prominent men in the State who were\r\nanything but skilled in such enterprises. In the beginning of its\r\ncareer, while high officials bestowed fat offices upon friends and\r\nrelatives, its finances were in a chaotic condition. It was during this\r\nstate of affairs that Commodore Vanderbilt, with a master mind, grasped\r\nthe situation and reorganized the whole system, thereby greatly\r\nincreasing his own fortune, and placing the railroad upon a sound\r\nfinancial basis. After such a remarkable career \"blindness to the\r\nfuture\" seems unkindly given, as doubtless it would have been a source\r\nof great satisfaction to this Vanderbilt progenitor could he have known\r\nbefore passing onward that his hard-earned wealth would eventually\r\nenrich his descendants, even the representatives of nobility.\r\n\r\nI have before me an invitation to a New York Assembly, dated the 29th of\r\nJanuary, 1841, addressed to my father and mother, which has followed my\r\nwanderings through seventy years. All of the managers, a list of whom I\r\ngive, were representative citizens as well as prominent society men of\r\nthe day:\r\n\r\n     Abm. Schermerhorn,      J. Swift Livingston,\r\n     Edmd. Pendleton,        Jacob R. LeRoy,\r\n     James W. Otis,          Thos. W. Ludlow,\r\n     Wm. Douglas,            Chas. McEvers, Jr.,\r\n     Henry Delafield,        William S. Miller,\r\n     Henry W. Hicks,         Charles C. King.\r\n\r\nAbraham Schermerhorn belonged to a wealthy New York family, and Edmund\r\nPendleton was a Virginian by birth who resided in New York where he\r\nbecame socially prominent. James W. Otis was of the Harrison Gray Otis\r\nfamily of Boston and, as I have already stated, I was at school with his\r\ndaughter, Sally. William Douglas was a bachelor living in an attractive\r\nresidence on Park Place, where he occasionally entertained his friends.\r\nHe belonged to a thrifty family of Scotch descent and had two sisters,\r\nMrs. Douglas Cruger and Mrs. James Monroe, whose husband was a namesake\r\nand nephew of the ex-President. Early in the last century their mother,\r\nMrs. George Douglas, gave a ball, and I insert some doggerel with\r\nreference to it written by Miss Anne Macmaster, who later became Mrs.\r\nCharles Russell Codman of Boston. These verses are interesting from the\r\nfact that they give the names of many of the _belles_ and _beaux_ of\r\nthat time:\r\n\r\n    I meant, my dear Fanny, to give you a call\r\n    And tell you the news of the Douglases ball;\r\n    But the weather's so bad,--I've a cold in my head,--\r\n    And I daren't venture out; so I send you instead\r\n    A poetic epistle--for plain humble prose\r\n    Is not worthy the joys of this ball to disclose.\r\n    To begin with our entrance, we came in at nine,\r\n    The two rooms below were prodigiously fine,\r\n    And the _coup d'oeil_ was shewy and brilliant 'tis true,\r\n    Pretty faces not wanting, some old and some new.\r\n    But, oh! my dear cousin, no words can describe\r\n    The excess of the crowd--like two swarms in one hive.\r\n    The squeezing and panting, the blowing and puffing,\r\n    The smashing, the crushing, the snatching, the stuffing,\r\n    I'd have given my new dress, at one time, I declare,\r\n    (The white satin and roses), for one breath of air!\r\n    But oh! how full often I inwardly sighed\r\n    O'er the wreck of those roses, so lately my pride;\r\n    Those roses, my own bands so carefully placed,\r\n    As I fondly believed, with such exquisite taste.\r\n    Then to see them so cruelly torn and destroyed\r\n    I assure you, my dear, I was vastly annoyed.\r\n    The ballroom with garlands was prettily drest,\r\n    But a small room for dancing it must be confess'd,\r\n    If you chanc'd to get in you were lucky no doubt,\r\n    But oh! luckier far, if you chanced to get out!\r\n    And pray who were there? Is the question you'll ask.\r\n    To name the one half would be no easy task--\r\n    There were Bayards and Clarksons, Van Hornes and LeRoys,\r\n    All famous, you well know, for making a noise.\r\n    There were Livingstons, Lenoxes, Henrys and Hoffmans,\r\n    And Crugers and Carys, Barnewalls and Bronsons,\r\n    Delanceys and Dyckmans and little De Veaux,\r\n    Gouverneurs and Goelets and Mr. Picot,\r\n    And multitudes more that would tire me to reckon,\r\n    But I must not forget the pretty Miss Whitten.\r\n    No particular belle claimed the general attention,\r\n    There were many, however, most worthy of mention.\r\n    The lily of Leonards' might hold the first place\r\n    For sweetness of manner, and beauty and grace.\r\n    Her cousin Eliza and little Miss Gitty\r\n    Both danc'd very lightly, and looked very pretty.\r\n    The youngest Miss Mason attracted much notice,\r\n    So did Susan Le Roy and the English Miss Otis;\r\n    Of _Beaux_ there were plenty, some new ones 'tis true,\r\n    But I won't mention names, no, not even to you.\r\n    I was lucky in getting good partners, however,\r\n    Above all, the two Emmetts, so lively and clever.\r\n    With Morris and Maitland I danc'd; and with Sedgwick,\r\n    Martin Wilkins, young Armstrong and droll William Renwick.\r\n    The old lady was mightily deck'd for the Ball\r\n    With Harriet's pearls--and the little one's shawl;\r\n    But to give her her due she was civil enough,\r\n    Only tiresome in asking the people to stuff.\r\n    There was supper at twelve for those who could get it,\r\n    I came in too late, but I did not regret it,\r\n    For eating at parties was never my passion,\r\n    And I'm sorry to see that it's so much the fashion.\r\n    After supper, for dancing we'd plenty of room,\r\n    And so pleasant it was, that I did not get home\r\n    Until three--when the ladies began to look drowsy,\r\n    The lamps to burn dim, and the Laird to grow boosy.\r\n    The ball being ended, I've no more to tell--\r\n    And so, my dear Fanny, I bid you farewell.\r\n\r\nIn the old pamphlet from which I have already quoted, edited in 1845 by\r\nMoses Y. Beach and compiled for the purpose of furnishing information\r\nconcerning the status of New York citizens to banks, merchants and\r\nothers, I find the following amusing description of George Douglas:\r\n\"George Douglas was a Scotch merchant who hoarded closely. His wine\r\ncellar was more extensive than his library. When George used to see\r\npeople speculating and idle it distressed him. He would say: 'People get\r\ntoo many _idees_ in their head. Why don't they work?' What a blessing he\r\nis not alive in this moonshine age of dreamy schemings.\" Mr. Beach\r\napparently was not capable of appreciating a thrifty Scotchman.\r\n\r\nThis same pamphlet gives an account of a picturesque character whom I\r\ndistinctly remember as a highly prominent citizen of New York. His\r\nparentage was involved in mystery, and has remained so until this day. I\r\nrefer to Mr. Preserved Fish, the senior member of the firm of Fish,\r\nGrinnell & Co., which subsequently became the prominent business house\r\nof Grinnell, Minturn & Co. Sustained by the apparel peculiar to infants,\r\nhe was found floating in the water by some New Bedford fishermen who,\r\nunable to discover his identity, bestowed upon him the uncouth name\r\nwhich, willingly or unwillingly, he bore until the day of his death. He\r\nand the other members of his firm were originally from New Bedford, one\r\nof the chief centers of the whale fisheries of New England, and came to\r\nNew York to attend to the oil and candle industries of certain merchants\r\nof the former city. Few business men in New York in my day were more\r\nhighly respected for indomitable energy and personal integrity than Mr.\r\nFish. He became President of the Tradesmen's Bank, and held other\r\npositions of responsibility and trust. He represented an ideal type of\r\nthe self-made man, and in spite of an unknown origin and a ridiculous\r\nname battled successfully with life without a helping hand.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Douglas family, I recall a beautiful wedding\r\nreception which, as well as I can remember, took place in the autumn of\r\n1850, at Fanwood, Fort Washington, then a suburb of New York. The bride\r\nwas Fanny Monroe, a daughter of Colonel James Monroe, U.S.A., and\r\ngranddaughter of Mrs. Douglas of whose ball I have just spoken. The\r\ngroom was Douglas Robinson, a native of Scotland. It was a gorgeous\r\nautumn day when the votaries of pleasure and fashion in New York drove\r\nout to Fanwood, where groomsmen of social prominence stood upon the wide\r\nportico to greet the guests and conduct them to the side of the newly\r\nmarried pair. Mrs. Winfield Scott was our guest in Houston Street at the\r\ntime, but did not accompany us to the wedding as no invitation had\r\nreached her. My presence reminded Mrs. Monroe that Mrs. Scott was in New\r\nYork, and she immediately inquired why I had not brought her with me. As\r\nI gave the reason both Colonel and Mrs. Monroe seemed exceedingly\r\nannoyed. It seems that her invitation had been sent to Washington but\r\nhad not been forwarded to her in New York. In those days Mrs. Scott's\r\ndistinguished presence and sparkling repartee, together with the fact\r\nthat her husband was Commander-in-Chief of the Army, added luster to\r\nevery assemblage. The Army was well represented at this reception and it\r\nwas truly \"the feast of reason and the flow of soul.\" Colonel \"Jimmy\"\r\nMonroe was a great favorite with his former brother-in-arms as he was a\r\ngenial, whole-souled and hospitable gentleman. My sister Margaret and I\r\nwere accompanied to Fanwood by an army officer, Colonel Donald Fraser, a\r\nbachelor whom I had met some years before at West Point. The paths of\r\nthe bride and myself diverged, and it was a very long time before we met\r\nagain. It was only a few years ago, while she was residing temporarily\r\nin Washington. She was then, however, a widow and was living in great\r\nretirement. She is now deceased.\r\n\r\nWhen we alighted from our carriage the day of the Monroe-Robinson\r\nwedding at Fanwood a young man whom I subsequently learned was Mr.\r\nSamuel L. Gouverneur, junior, a cousin of the bride, walked over to me,\r\nasked my name and in his capacity of groomsman inquired whether I would\r\nallow him to present me to the bride. I was particularly impressed by\r\nhis appearance, as it was unusually attractive. He had raven-black hair,\r\nlarge bluish-gray eyes and regular features; but what added to his charm\r\nin my youthful fancy was the fact that he had only recently returned\r\nfrom the Mexican War, in which, as I learned later, he had served with\r\ngreat gallantry in the 4th Artillery. I had never seen him before,\r\nalthough in thinking the matter over a few days later I remembered that\r\nI had met his mother and sister in society in New York. I did not see\r\nhim again until five years later, when our paths crossed in Washington,\r\nand in due time I became his bride.\r\n\r\nTo return to the New York Assembly in 1841. Henry Delafield, whose name\r\nappears on the card of invitation, belonged to a well-known family. His\r\nfather, an Englishman by birth, settled in New York in 1783 and is\r\ndescribed in an early city directory as \"John Delafield, Insurance\r\nBroker, 29 Water Street.\" The Delafields were a large family of brothers\r\nand were highly prosperous. I remember once hearing Dr. John W. Francis\r\nsay: \"Put a Delafield on a desert island in the middle of the ocean,\r\nand he will thrive and prosper.\" Henry Delafield and his brother William\r\nwere almost inseparable. They were twins and strikingly alike in\r\nappearance. General Richard Delafield, U.S.A., for many years\r\nSuperintendent of the Military Academy at West Point, was another\r\nbrother, as was also Dr. Edward Delafield, a physician of note, who\r\nlived in Bleecker Street and in 1839 married Miss Julia Floyd of Long\r\nIsland, a granddaughter of William Floyd, one of the New York Signers.\r\nAbout thirty-five years ago three of the Delafield brothers, Joseph,\r\nHenry and Edward, all advanced in life, died within a few days of each\r\nother and were buried in Greenwood Cemetery at the same time, the\r\nfuneral taking place from old Trinity Church. On this occasion all the\r\nold customs were observed, and the coffins were made of solid mahogany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL L. GOUVERNEUR, JUNIOR.]\r\n\r\nJohn Swift Livingston lived in Leonard Street, and I recall very\r\npleasantly a party which I attended at his house before the marriage of\r\nhis daughter Estelle to General John Watts de Peyster. The latter,\r\ntogether with his first cousins, General \"Phil\" Kearny and Mrs.\r\nAlexander Macomb, inherited an enormous fortune from his grandfather\r\nJohn Watts, who was one of the most prominent men of his day and the\r\nfounder of the Leake and Watts Orphan House, which is still in\r\nexistence. John G. Leake was an Englishman who came to New York to live\r\nand, dying without heirs, left his fortune to Robert Watts, a minor son\r\nof John Watts. Robert Watts, however, did not long survive his\r\nbenefactor. Upon his death the Leake will was contested by his\r\nrelatives, but a decision was rendered in favor of the nearest kin of\r\nthe boy, who was his father. After gaining his victory John Watts\r\nestablished this Orphan House and with true magnanimity placed Leake's\r\nname before his own. Jacob R. LeRoy lived in Greenwich Street near the\r\nBattery, which at this time was a fashionable section of the city.\r\nHis sister Caroline, whom I knew, became the second wife of Daniel\r\nWebster. Mr. LeRoy's daughter Charlotte married Rev. Henry de Koven,\r\nwhose son is the musical genius, Reginald de Koven. Henry W. Hicks was\r\nthe son of a prominent Quaker merchant and a member of the firm of Hicks\r\n& Co., which did an enormous shipping business until its suspension,\r\nabout 1847, owing to foreign business embarrassments. Thomas W. Ludlow\r\nwas a wealthy citizen, genial and most hospitably inclined. He owned a\r\nhandsome country-seat near Tarrytown, and every now and then it was his\r\npleasure to charter a steamboat to convey his guests thither; and I\r\nrecall several pleasant days I spent in this manner. When we reached the\r\nTarrytown home a fine collation always awaited us and in its wake came\r\nmusic and dancing. Charles McEvers, junior, belonged to an old New York\r\nfamily and was one of the executors of the Vanden Heuvel estate. His\r\nniece, Mary McEvers, married Sir Edward Cunard, who was knighted by\r\nQueen Victoria. William Starr Miller married a niece of Philip Schuyler,\r\nwho was a woman possessing many excellent traits of character. As far as\r\nI can remember, she was the only divorced person of those days who was\r\nwell received in society, for people with \"past histories\" were then\r\nregarded with marked disfavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSOME DISTINGUISHED ACQUAINTANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn close proximity to St. John's Park, during my early life on Hubert\r\nStreet, there resided a Frenchman named Laurent Salles, and I have a\r\nvivid recollection of a notable marriage which was solemnized in his\r\nmansion. The groom, Lispenard Stewart, married his daughter, Miss Louise\r\nStephanie Salles, but the young and pretty bride survived her marriage\r\nfor only a few years. She left two children, one of whom is Mrs.\r\nFrederick Graham Lee, whom I occasionally see in Washington, where with\r\nher husband she spends her winters.\r\n\r\nWhen playing in St. John's Park in this same neighborhood, I made the\r\nacquaintance of Margaret Tillotson Kemble, one of the young daughters of\r\nWilliam Kemble already mentioned as living on Beach Street, opposite\r\nthat Park. Mr. Kemble was the son of Peter Kemble, member of the\r\nprominent firm of \"Gouverneur and Kemble,\" shipping merchants of New\r\nYork, which traded with China and other foreign countries. This firm,\r\nthe senior members of which were the brothers Nicholas and Isaac\r\nGouverneur, was bound together by a close family tie, as Mrs. Peter\r\nKemble was Gertrude Gouverneur, a sister of the two Gouverneur brothers.\r\nMy intimacy with Margaret Tillotson Kemble, formed almost from the\r\ncradle, lasted without a break throughout life. She was a second cousin\r\nof my husband and married Charles J. Nourse, a member of the old\r\nGeorgetown, D.C., family. The last years of her life were entirely\r\ndevoted to good works. Her sister, Mary, married Dr. Frederick D. Lente,\r\nat one time physician to the West Point foundry, at Cold Spring, N.Y.,\r\nand subsequently a distinguished general practitioner in New York and\r\nSaratoga Springs. Ellen Kemble, the other sister, of whom I have already\r\nspoken, never married. She was eminent for her piety, and her whole life\r\nwas largely devoted to works of charity.\r\n\r\nThe Kemble house on Beach Street was always a social center and I think\r\nI can truthfully say it was more than a second home to me. Mrs. William\r\nKemble, who was Miss Margaret Chatham Seth of Maryland, was a woman of\r\ndecided social tastes and a most efficient assistant to her husband in\r\ndispensing hospitality. Gathered around her hearthstone was a large\r\nfamily of girls and boys who naturally added much brightness to the\r\nhousehold. Mr. Kemble was a well-known patron of art and his house\r\nbecame the rendezvous for persons of artistic tastes. It was in his\r\ndrawing-room that I met William Cullen Bryant; Charles B. King of\r\nWashington, whose portraits are so well known; John Gadsby Chapman, who\r\npainted the \"Baptism of Pocahontas,\" now in the rotunda of the Capitol\r\nat Washington; Asher B. Durand, the celebrated artist; and Mr. Kemble's\r\nbrother-in-law, James K. Paulding, who at the time was Secretary of the\r\nNavy under President Martin Van Buren. Mr. Kemble was one of the\r\nfounders of the Century Club of New York, a life member of the Academy\r\nof Design, and in 1817, at the age of twenty-one, in conjunction with\r\nhis older brother, Gouverneur Kemble, established the West Point\r\nfoundry, which for a long period received heavy ordnance contracts from\r\nthe United States government. The famous Parrott guns were manufactured\r\nthere. Captain Robert P. Parrott, their inventor and an army officer,\r\nmarried Mary Kemble, a sister of Gouverneur and William Kemble, who in\r\nearly life was regarded as a beauty. Mr. William Kemble, apart from his\r\nartistic tastes, owned a number of fine pictures, among which was a\r\nSappho by a Spanish master. It was given to Mrs. Kemble by the\r\ngrandfather of the late Rear Admiral Richard W. Meade, U.S.N. When the\r\nKemble family left Beach Street and moved to West Twenty-fifth Street\r\nthis picture was sold to Gouverneur Kemble for $5,000, and placed in his\r\nextensive picture gallery at Cold Spring.\r\n\r\nMrs. William Kemble was a woman of marked ability and an able\r\n_raconteurse_. Early in life she had been left an orphan and was brought\r\nup by her maternal uncle, Dr. Thomas Tillotson of the Eastern shore of\r\nMaryland, whose wife was Margaret Livingston, a daughter of Judge Robert\r\nR. Livingston and a sister of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston. Another\r\nsister of Mrs. Tillotson was the widow of General Richard Montgomery, of\r\nthe Revolutionary War, who fell at the battle of Quebec. The Tillotsons,\r\nLivingstons and Montgomerys all owned fine residences near Hyde Park on\r\nthe Hudson; and a close intimacy existed between the Tillotsons and the\r\nKembles owing to the fact that Mr. Kemble's first cousin, Emily\r\nGouverneur, married Mrs. Kemble's first cousin, Robert Livingston\r\nTillotson. William Kemble's younger brother, Richard Frederick, married\r\nMiss Charlotte Morris, daughter of James Morris of Morrisania, N.Y.\r\n\r\nThe summer home of William Kemble was in a large grove of trees at Cold\r\nSpring and life under its roof was indeed an ideal existence. I was\r\ntheir constant guest and although it was a simple life it teemed with\r\nbeauty and interest. Our days were spent principally out of doors and\r\nthe sources of amusement were always near at hand. As all of the Kembles\r\nwere experts with the oar, we frequently spent many hours on the Hudson.\r\nAnother unfailing source of pleasure was a frequent visit to West Point\r\nto witness the evening parade. As we knew many of the cadets they\r\nfrequently crossed the river to take an informal meal or enjoy an hour's\r\ntalk on the attractive lawn. Lieutenant Colonel (subsequently General)\r\nWilliam J. Hardee, who for a long time was Commandant of Cadets at West\r\nPoint, I knew quite well. Later in his career he was ordered to\r\nWashington, where as a widower he became a social lion, devoting himself\r\nchiefly to Isabella Cass, a daughter of General Lewis Cass. His career\r\nin the Confederate Army is too well known for me to relate. After the\r\nCivil War I never saw him again, as he lived in the South. During one of\r\nmy visits at the Kembles General Robert E. Lee was the Superintendent of\r\nthe West Point Military Academy, but of him I shall speak hereafter.\r\n\r\nAmong the cadets whom I recall are Henry Heth of Virginia, an officer\r\nwho was subsequently highly esteemed in the Army, and who, at the\r\nbreaking out of the Civil War, followed the fortunes of his native state\r\nand became a Major General in the Confederate Army; Innis N. Palmer,\r\nwhom I met many years later in Washington when he had attained the rank\r\nof General; and Cadet Daniel M. Beltzhoover of Pennsylvania, a musical\r\ngenius, who was a source of great pleasure to us but whose career I have\r\nnot followed.\r\n\r\nAt this period in the history of West Point Cozzen's Hotel was the only\r\nhostelry within the military enclosure. A man named Benny Havens kept a\r\nstore in close proximity to the Military Academy, but as it was not upon\r\ngovernment territory no cadet was allowed to enter the premises.\r\nAlthough liquor was his principal stock in trade he kept other articles\r\nof merchandise, but only as a cover for his unlawful traffic. The cadets\r\nhad their weaknesses then as now, and as this shop was \"forbidden fruit\"\r\nmany of them visited his resort under the cover of darkness. If caught\r\nthere \"after taps,\" the punishment was dismissal. The following\r\nselections from a dozen verses written by Lieutenant Lucius O'Brien,\r\nU.S.A., and others, which I remember hearing the cadets frequently sing,\r\nwere set to the tune of \"Wearing of the Green\":\r\n\r\n    Come, fill your glasses, fellows, and stand up in a row,\r\n    To singing sentimentally, we're going for to go;\r\n    In the army there's sobriety, promotion's very slow,\r\n    So we'll sing our reminiscences of Benny Havens, oh!\r\n\r\n      Oh, Benny Havens, oh!--oh! Benny Havens oh!\r\n      So we'll sing our reminiscences of Benny Havens, oh!\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Come, fill up to our Generals, God bless the brave heroes,\r\n    They're an honor to their country and a terror to her foes;\r\n    May they long rest on their laurels and trouble never know,\r\n    But live to see a thousand years at Benny Havens, oh!\r\n\r\n    Here's a health to General Taylor, whose \"rough and ready\" blow\r\n    Struck terror to the _rancheros_ of braggart Mexico;\r\n    May his country ne'er forget his deeds, and ne'er forget to show\r\n    She holds him worthy of a place at Benny Havens, oh!\r\n\r\n    To the \"veni vidi vici\" man, to Scott, the great hero,\r\n    Fill up the goblet to the brim, let no one shrinking go;\r\n    May life's cares on his honored head fall light as flakes of snow,\r\n    And his fair fame be ever great at Benny Havens, oh!\r\n\r\nLieutenant O'Brien died in the winter of 1841 and the following verse to\r\nhis memory was fittingly added to his song:\r\n\r\n    From the courts of death and danger from Tampa's deadly shore,\r\n    There comes a wail of manly grief, \"O'Brien is no more,\"\r\n    In the land of sun and flowers his head lies pillowed low,\r\n    No more he'll sing \"Petite Coquette\" or Benny Havens, oh!\r\n\r\nSince then numerous other verses have been added, from time to time,\r\nand, for aught I know to the contrary, the composition is still growing.\r\nAfter the death of General Scott in 1866 the following verse was added:\r\n\r\n    Another star has faded, we miss its brilliant glow,\r\n    For the veteran Scott has ceased to be a soldier here below;\r\n    And the country which he honored now feels a heart-felt woe,\r\n    As we toast his name in reverence at Benny Havens, oh!\r\n\r\nI wish that I could recall more of these lines as some of the prominent\r\nmen of the Army were introduced in the most suggestive fashion. Benny\r\nHavens doubtless has been sleeping his last sleep for these many years,\r\nbut I am sure that some of these verses are still remembered by many of\r\nthe surviving graduates of West Point.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of William Kemble's cottage at Cold Spring was the\r\npermanent home of his older brother, Gouverneur Kemble. For a few years\r\nduring his earlier life he served as U.S. Consul at Cadiz, under the\r\nadministration of President Monroe. His Cold Spring home was of historic\r\ninterest and for many years was the scene of lavish hospitality. General\r\nScott once remarked that he was \"the most perfect gentleman in the\r\nUnited States.\" The most distinguished men of the day gathered around\r\nhis table, and every Saturday night through the entire year a special\r\ndinner was served at five o'clock--Mr. Kemble despised the habitual\r\nthree o'clock dinners of his neighbors--which in time became historic\r\nentertainments. This meal was always served in the picture gallery, an\r\noctagonal room filled with valuable paintings, while breakfast and\r\nluncheon were served in an adjoining room. All of the professors and\r\nmany of the officers at West Point, whom Mr. Kemble facetiously termed\r\n\"the boys,\" had a standing invitation to these Saturday evening dinners.\r\nThere was an agreement, however, among the younger officers that too\r\nmany of them should not partake of his hospitality at the same time, as\r\nhis dining table would not accommodate more than thirty guests. How well\r\nI remember these older men, all of whom were officers in the Regular\r\nArmy: Professors William H. C. Bartlett, Dennis H. Mahan, the father of\r\nCaptain Alfred T. Mahan, U.S.N., Albert E. Church, and Robert W. Weir.\r\nIf by any chance Mr. Kemble, or \"Uncle Gouv,\" as he was generally known\r\nto the family connection, was obliged to be absent from home, these\r\nentertainments took place just the same, presided over by his sister,\r\nMrs. Robert P. Parrott. Indeed, I recall that during a tour of Europe\r\nMr. Kemble made with ex-President Van Buren these Saturday dinner\r\nparties were continued for at least a year.\r\n\r\nCarving was considered a fine art in those days, an accomplishment which\r\nhas largely gone out of style since the introduction of dinner _à la\r\nRusse_. A law existed in Putnam County, in which Cold Spring is\r\nsituated, which forbade the killing of game during certain months in the\r\nyear. When a transgressor of this law succeeded in \"laying low\" a pair\r\nof pheasants, they were nicknamed \"owls\"; and I have seen two \"owls\"\r\nwhich, under these circumstances, were almost unobtainable, carved in\r\nsuch a proficient manner by \"Uncle Gouv\" that, although we numbered over\r\na score, each person received a \"satisfying\" piece. His guests were most\r\nappreciative of his hospitality, and I once heard General Scott say that\r\nhe would be willing to walk at least ten miles to be present at a dinner\r\nat Gouverneur Kemble's. His wines were always well selected as well as\r\nabundant. I have often known him to have a house party of many guests\r\nwho had the privilege of remaining indefinitely if they so desired. The\r\nactress Fanny Kemble and her father, though not related to the New York\r\nfamily, were guests in his home during one of their visits to America.\r\nShe was a great pedestrian, and I recall having a small stream of water\r\nin the vicinity of Cold Spring called to my notice where, during her\r\nrambles, she was known to stop and bathe her feet.\r\n\r\nLong before the War of the Revolution, Mr. Kemble's aunt, Margaret\r\nKemble, married General Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief of the British\r\nforces in that conflict, and resided with him in England. While I was\r\nliving in Frederick, Maryland, I sent \"Uncle Gouv\"--he was then an old\r\nman and very appreciative of any attention--a photograph of Whittier's\r\nheroine, Barbara Frietchie. He in turn sent it to Viscount Henry Gage, a\r\nrelative of the British General. The English nobleman who was familiar\r\nwith the Quaker poet seemed highly pleased to own the picture and\r\ncommented favorably upon the firm expression of the mouth and chin of\r\nthis celebrated woman.\r\n\r\nArmy officers were frequently stationed at Cold Spring to inspect the\r\nguns cast at the Kemble foundry. Among these I recall with much pleasure\r\nMajor Alfred Mordecai of the Ordnance Corps. He was a highly efficient\r\nofficer and previous to the Civil War rendered conspicuous service to\r\nhis country. He was a Southerner and at the beginning of the war is said\r\nto have requested the War Department to order him to some duty which did\r\nnot involve the killing of his kinsmen. His request was denied and his\r\nresignation followed.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the Civil War, after a protracted absence from the\r\ncountry in China, I arrived in New York, and one of the first items of\r\nnews that was told me was that the West Point foundry was casting guns\r\nfor the Confederacy. I speedily learned that this rumor was altogether\r\nunfounded. It seems that some time before the beginning of hostilities\r\nthe State of Georgia ordered some small rifled cannon from the West\r\nPoint foundry with the knowledge and consent of the Chief of the\r\nOrdnance Department, General Alexander B. Dyer. Colonel William J.\r\nHardee, then Commandant-of-Cadets, was selected to inspect these guns\r\nbefore delivery; but when they were finished the war-cloud had grown to\r\nsuch proportions that Robert P. Parrott, the head of the foundry at the\r\ntime, Gouverneur Kemble having retired from active business eight or ten\r\nyears previously, refused to forward them. They lay at the foundry for\r\nsome time, and were afterwards bought by private parties from New York\r\nCity and presented to the government, thereby doing active service\r\nagainst the Confederacy. In his interesting book recently published\r\nentitled \"Retrospections of an Active Life,\" Mr. John Bigelow refers to\r\nthis unfortunate rumor. He says: \"On the 21st of January, 1861, I met\r\nthe venerable Professor Weir, of the West Point Military Academy, in the\r\ncars on our way to New York, when he told me that Colonel Hardee, then\r\nthe Commandant-of-Cadets at the Academy, was buying arms for his native\r\nstate of Georgia, and that the Kembles, whose iron works were across the\r\nriver from West Point at Cold Spring, were filling a large order for\r\nhim.\" I knew Professor Weir very well, and Mr. Bigelow's statement, I\r\nthink, is a mistake, as all of the professors at West Point were too\r\nloyal to Mr. Gouverneur Kemble to allow wild rumors engendered by war to\r\nremain uncontradicted.\r\n\r\nThis seems a fitting place to recall the pleasant friendship I made with\r\nGeneral Robert E. Lee long before he became the Southern chieftain. I\r\nhave already stated that when I visited Cold Spring in other days he was\r\nSuperintendent of the U.S. Military Academy. He was a constant visitor\r\nat the Kembles, and his imposing presence and genial manner are so well\r\nknown as to render a description of them altogether superfluous. Some\r\nyears later when I was visiting at the home of General Winfield Scott in\r\nWashington I renewed my pleasing friendship with him. There existed\r\nbetween these two eminent soldiers a life-long attachment, and when the\r\nCivil War was raging it seemed almost impossible to realize that Scott\r\nand Lee represented opposite political views, as hitherto they had\r\nalways seemed to be so completely in accord.\r\n\r\nThe Cold Spring colony was decidedly sociable, and a dinner party at one\r\nof the many cottages was almost a daily occurrence. Captain and Mrs.\r\nRobert P. Parrott entertained most gracefully, and their residence was\r\none of the show-places of that locality. I have heard Captain Parrott\r\nfacetiously remark that he had \"made a loud noise in the world\" by the\r\naid of his guns.\r\n\r\nThe first time I ever saw Washington Irving, with whom I enjoyed an\r\nextended friendship, was when he was a guest of Gouverneur Kemble. The\r\nintimate social relations existing between these two friends began in\r\nearly life, and lasted throughout their careers, having been fostered by\r\na frequent interchange of visits. In his earlier life Mr. Kemble\r\ninherited from his relative, Nicholas Gouverneur, a fine old estate near\r\nNewark, New Jersey, which bore the name of \"Mount Pleasant.\" Washington\r\nIrving, however, rechristened the place \"Cockloft Hall,\" and in a vein\r\nof mirth dubbed the bachelor-proprietor \"The Patroon.\" Irving described\r\nthis retreat in his \"Salmagundi,\" and the characters there depicted\r\nwhich have been thought by many to be fanciful creations were in reality\r\nGouverneur Kemble and his many friends. His place was subsequently sold,\r\nbut the intimacy between the two men continued, and it has always seemed\r\nto me that there was much pathos connected with their friendship. Both\r\nof them were bachelors and owned homes of more than passing historic\r\ninterest on the Hudson. Irving called Kemble's residence at Cold Spring\r\n\"Bachelor's Elysium,\" while to his own he applied the name of \"Wolfert's\r\nRoost.\" In the spring of 1856 in writing to Kemble he said: \"I am happy\r\nto learn that your lawn is green. I hope it will long continue so, and\r\nyourself likewise. I shall come up one of these days and have a roll on\r\nit with you\"; and Kemble, upon another occasion, in urging Irving to\r\nvisit him added as an inducement, \"come and we will have a game of\r\nleap-frog.\" Referring to their last meeting Irving said of Kemble: \"That\r\nis my friend of early life--always unchanged, always like a brother, one\r\nof the noblest beings that ever was created. His heart is pure gold.\"\r\nThat was in the summer of 1859, and in the following November Irving\r\ndied, at the ripe old age of seventy-six. Constant in life, let us hope\r\nthat in death they are not separated, and that in the Silent Land\r\n\r\n    No morrow's mischief knocks them up.\r\n\r\nLet the cynic who spurns the consoling influences of friendship ponder\r\nupon the life-intimacy of these two old men who, throughout the cares\r\nand turmoils of a long and engrossing existence, illustrated so\r\nbeautifully the charm of such a benign relationship.\r\n\r\nIrving impressed me as having a genial but at the same time a retiring\r\nnature. He was of about the average height and, although quite advanced\r\nin years when I knew him, his hair had not changed color. His manner was\r\nexceeding gentle and, strange to say, with such a remarkable vocabulary\r\nat his command, in society he was exceedingly quiet. In his early life\r\nIrving was engaged to be married to one of his own ethereal kind, but\r\nshe passed onward, and among his friends the subject was never broached\r\nas it seemed too sacred to dwell upon. Her name was Matilda Hoffman and\r\nshe was a daughter of the celebrated jurist of New York, Judge Josiah\r\nOgden Hoffman. She died in 1809 in her eighteenth year.\r\n\r\nMy last meeting with Irving is vividly impressed upon my memory as the\r\noccasion was quite memorable. I was passing the winter in Washington as\r\nthe guest of my elder sister, Mrs. Eames, who a few years before had\r\nmarried Charles Eames, Esq., of the Washington Bar. Irving, who was then\r\nseventy-two years old, was making a brief visit to the Capital and\r\ncalled to see me. This was in 1855, when William M. Thackeray was on his\r\nsecond visit to this country and delivering his celebrated lectures upon\r\n\"The Four Georges.\" I had scarcely welcomed Mr. Irving into my sister's\r\ndrawing-room when Thackeray was announced, and I introduced the two\r\nfamous but totally dissimilar men to each other. Thackeray was a man of\r\npowerful build and a very direct manner, but to my mind was not an\r\nindividual to be overpowered by sentiment. I can not remember after the\r\nflight of so many years the nature of the conversation between Irving\r\nand Thackeray apart from the mutual interchange that ordinarily passes\r\nbetween strangers when casually presented.\r\n\r\nLater I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Thackeray quite a number of\r\ntimes during his sojourn in Washington where he was much lionized in\r\nsociety. One evening we were all gathered around the family tea table\r\nwhen he chanced to call and join us in that cup which is said to cheer.\r\nHe entered into conversation with much enthusiasm, especially when he\r\nreferred to his children. He seemed to have a special admiration for a\r\nyoung daughter of his, and related many pleasing anecdotes of her\r\njuvenile aptitude. I think he referred to Anne Isabella Thackeray (Lady\r\nRichie), who gave to the public a biographical edition of her father's\r\nfamous works. I remember we drifted into a conversation upon a recently\r\npublished novel, but the title of the book and its author I do not\r\nrecall. At any rate, he was discussing its heroine, who, under some\r\nextraordinary stress of circumstances, was forced to walk many miles in\r\nher stocking-feet to obtain succor, and the whole story was thrilling in\r\nthe extreme; whereupon the author of \"Vanity Fair\" exclaimed, \"She was\r\nshoeicidal.\" Although he was an Englishman, he was not averse to a\r\npun--even a poor one! I remember asking Mr. Thackeray whether during his\r\nvisit to New York he had met Mrs. De Witt Clinton. His response was\r\ncharacteristic: \"Yes, and she is a gay old girl!\"\r\n\r\nJames K. Paulding, the distinguished author who married the sister of\r\nGouverneur and William Kemble and lived at Hyde Park, farther up the\r\nHudson, frequently formed one of the pleasant coterie that gathered\r\naround \"Uncle Gouv's\" board. \"The Sage of Lindenwald,\" as ex-President\r\nMartin Van Buren was frequently called by both friend and foe, also\r\nrepeatedly came from his home in Kinderhook to dine with Mr. Kemble, and\r\nthese memories call to mind a dinner I attended at \"Uncle Gouv's\" when\r\nMr. Van Buren was the principal guest. Although it was many years after\r\nhis retirement from the presidential office, the impression he made upon\r\nme was that of a quiet, deliberate old gentleman, who continued to be\r\nwell versed in the affairs of state.\r\n\r\nA short distance from Cold Spring is Garrison's, where many wealthy New\r\nYorkers have their country seats. Putnam County, in which both\r\nGarrison's and Cold Spring are located, was once a portion of Philipse\r\nManor. The house in the \"Upper Manor,\" as this tract of land was called,\r\nwas The Grange, but over forty years ago it was burned to the ground. It\r\nwas originally built by Captain Frederick Philips about 1800, and was\r\nthe scene of much festivity. The Philipses were tories during the\r\nRevolution, and it is said that this property would doubtless have been\r\nconfiscated by the government but for the fact that Mary Philips, who\r\nwas Captain Frederick Philips' only child, was a minor at the close of\r\nthe war in 1783. Mary Philips, whose descendants have spelled the name\r\nwith a final _e_, married Samuel Gouverneur, and their eldest son,\r\nFrederick Philipse Gouverneur, dropped the name Gouverneur as a surname\r\nand assumed that of Philipse in order to inherit a large landed estate\r\nof which The Grange was a conspicuous part.\r\n\r\nWhen I first visited Garrison's the Philipse family was living at The\r\nGrange in great elegance. Frederick Philipse was then a bachelor and his\r\nmaiden sister, Mary Marston Gouverneur, presided over his establishment.\r\nAnother sister, Margaret Philipse Gouverneur, married William Moore, a\r\nson of the beloved physician, Dr. William Moore of New York, a nephew of\r\nPresident Benjamin Moore of Columbia College and a first cousin of\r\nClement C. Moore who wrote the oft quoted verses, \"'Twas the Night\r\nbefore Christmas,\" which have delighted the hearts of American children\r\nfor so many decades.\r\n\r\nFrederick Philipse subsequently married Catharine Wadsworth Post, a\r\nmember of a prominent family of New York. It was while Mr. and Mrs.\r\nPhilipse were visiting her relatives that The Grange was destroyed by\r\nfire. Miss Mary Marston Gouverneur had ordered the chimneys cleaned, in\r\nthe manner then prevalent, by making a fire in the chimney place on the\r\nfirst floor, in order to burn out the débris. The flames fortunately\r\nbroke out on the top story, thus enabling members of the family to save\r\nmany valuable heirlooms in the lower apartments. Among the paintings\r\nrescued and now in the possession of Frederick Philipse's daughters, the\r\nMisses Catharine Wadsworth Philipse and Margaret Gouverneur Philipse of\r\nNew York, was the portrait of the pretty Mary Philipse, Washington's\r\nfirst love. Tradition states she refused his offer of marriage to become\r\nthe bride of Roger Morris, an officer in the British Army. It is\r\ngenerally believed that she was the heroine of Cooper's \"Spy;\" but she\r\nhad then laid aside the belleship of early youth and had become the\r\nintellectual matron of after years. Some of the other portraits rescued\r\nwere those of Adolphus Philipse, second son of the first Lord of the\r\nManor; Philip Philipse, and his wife, Margaret Marston, whose second\r\nhusband was the Rev. John Ogilvie, for many years assistant minister of\r\nTrinity Church of New York; Margaret Philipse, younger sister of Mary,\r\nwho married Roger Morris; Captain Frederick Philips, by Gilbert Stuart;\r\nMrs. Samuel Gouverneur; Nathaniel Marston and his wife, Mary Crooke; and\r\nMrs. Abraham Gouverneur who was the daughter of Jacob Leisler, at one\r\ntime the Acting Governor of the Province of New York.\r\n\r\nOne visit I made to the Philipses at Garrison's is especially fresh in\r\nmy memory, as Eleanor Jones Duer, a daughter of President William A.\r\nDuer of Columbia College, who subsequently married George T. Wilson of\r\nGeorgia, was their guest at the same time. She was a woman of much\r\nculture and refinement, and in every way a delightful companion. A great\r\nintimacy existed for many years between the Gouverneurs and Philipses of\r\nGarrison's and the Duer family of New York. The Philipses, who at this\r\ntime lived very much in the old-fashioned style, were the last of the\r\nold families with which I was familiar to have the cloth removed after\r\nthe dessert was served; and in doing this an elegant mahogany table\r\nalways kept in a highly polished condition was displayed. Upon it were\r\nplaced the fruits, nuts and wine. Another custom in the Philipse family\r\nwhich, as far as I know, was unique in this country was that of having\r\nfour meals a day. Breakfast was served at eight, luncheon at one, dinner\r\nat six and supper at nine o'clock.\r\n\r\nDuring another visit I made at The Grange I had the pleasure of meeting\r\nMr. and Mrs. Henry Sheaffe Hoyt (Frances Maria Duer), who were house\r\nguests there and who had just returned from an extended European tour.\r\nShe was another daughter of President Duer of Columbia College and died\r\nnot long ago in Newport, R.I., at a very advanced age. Mrs. John King\r\nVan Rensselaer, a daughter of Mrs. Archibald Gracie King (Elizabeth\r\nDenning Duer), is her niece.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the banks of the Hudson River I must speak of my former\r\nassociations with Newburgh. From my earliest life we children were in\r\nthe habit of making frequent visits to my mother's relatives, the Roe\r\nfamily, who resided there. We all eagerly looked forward to these trips\r\nup the Hudson which were made upon the old _Thomas Powell_ and later\r\nupon the _Mary Powell_. My mother's relative, Maria Hazard, married\r\nWilliam Roe, one of the most highly respected and prosperous citizens of\r\nNewburgh. They lived in a stately mansion surrounded by several acres\r\nof land in the heart of the city. Mrs. Roe was a remarkable woman. I\r\nknew her only as an elderly matron; but, like women of advanced age in\r\nChina, where I spent a number of years of my early married life, she\r\ncontrolled everyone who came within her \"sphere of influence.\" I\r\nremember, for example, that upon one occasion when I was visiting her,\r\nThomas Hazard Roe, her elder son, who at the time was over sixty years\r\nof age and a bachelor and who desired to go upon some hunting\r\nexpedition, said to her: \"Mother, have I your permission to go to the\r\nAdirondacks?\" She thought for a few moments and replied: \"Well, Hazard,\r\nI think you might go.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1840 Newburgh was recommended by two of the earliest\r\nprominent homeopathic physicians of New York City, Doctors John F. Gray\r\nand Amos G. Hull, as a locality well-adapted to people affected with\r\ndelicate lungs, and upon their advice many families built handsome\r\nresidences there. In my early recollection Newburgh had a fine hotel\r\ncalled the Powelton, which bade fair to become a prominent resort for\r\nNew Yorkers. In the zenith of its prosperity, however, it was burned to\r\nthe ground and was never rebuilt. I hardly think that anyone will have\r\nthe assurance to dispute the healthfulness of this place when I state\r\nthat my cousin, Thomas Hazard Roe, of whom I have just spoken, died\r\nthere in 1907 after having more than rounded a full century of years. He\r\nwas in many ways a remarkable man with a mind well stored with\r\nknowledge, and he retained all of his mental faculties unclouded until\r\nthe end of his life. His sister, Mary Elizabeth, the widow of the late\r\nWilliam C. Hasbrouck, a prominent Newburgh lawyer and a few years his\r\njunior, also died quite recently in Newburgh at the age of ninety-seven.\r\nHer son, General Henry C. Hasbrouck, U.S.A., also died but a short time\r\nsince, but her daughter, Miss Maria Hasbrouck, whose whole life has been\r\ndevoted to her family, still resides in the old homestead. The third\r\nand youngest member of this interesting trio, Miss Emily Maria Roe, is\r\nnow living in Newburgh at an advanced age, surrounded by a large\r\nconnection and beloved by everyone.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent families in Newburgh in years gone by was that\r\nof Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Powell, from whom the celebrated river boats were\r\nnamed. Mrs. Powell's maiden name was Mary Ludlow, and she belonged to a\r\nwell-known New York family. Her brother, Lieutenant Augustus C. Ludlow,\r\nwho was second in command on board the _Chesapeake_, under Captain James\r\nLawrence of \"Don't give up the ship\" fame, is buried by the latter's\r\nside in old Trinity church-yard in New York. Mrs. Powell took great\r\npride and pleasure in the boat named in her honor, the _Mary Powell_,\r\nand I have frequently seen her upon my trips up the Hudson, sitting upon\r\nthe deck of her namesake and chatting pleasantly with those around her.\r\n\r\nNewburgh was also the home of Andrew Jackson Downing, the author of\r\n\"Landscape Gardening,\" \"Cottage Residences,\" and other similar works. I\r\nreceived my first knowledge of horticulture from a visit I made to his\r\nbeautiful residence, which was surrounded by several acres. It was my\r\nearliest view of nature assisted by art, and to my untutored eye his\r\nlawn was a veritable Paradise. Some years later, when I was visiting the\r\nScotts in Washington, Mr. Downing called and during our conversation\r\ntold me that he had come to the Capital, upon the invitation of the\r\ngovernment, to lay out the Smithsonian grounds. His wife was Miss\r\nCaroline De Wint of Fishkill, New York, a granddaughter of Mrs. Henry\r\nWilliam Smith (Abigail Adams), the only daughter of President John Adams\r\nwho reached maturity. After spending some months in Washington, Mr.\r\nDowning was returning to his Newburgh home when the _Henry Clay_, a\r\nHudson River steamboat upon which he had taken passage, was destroyed\r\nby fire and he perished while attempting to rescue some of the\r\npassengers. This was in 1852.\r\n\r\nThere are some persons still living who will readily recall, in\r\nconnection with social functions, the not uncommon name of Brown. The\r\nparticular Brown to whom I refer was the sexton of Grace Episcopal\r\nChurch, on the corner of Broadway and Tenth Street, where many of the\r\n_soi-disant crème de la crème_ worshiped. He must have possessed a\r\nchristian name, but if so I never heard it for he was only plain Brown,\r\nand Brown he was called. He was born before the days when spurious\r\ngenealogical charts are thrust at one, _nolens volens_; but probably\r\nthis was lucky for him and the public was spared much that is\r\nuninteresting. In connection with his duties at Grace Church he came in\r\ncontact with many fashionable people, and was enabled to add materially\r\nto his rather small income by calling carriages from the doorsteps for\r\nthe society folk of the great metropolis. In this and other ways his\r\npursuits gradually became so varied that in time he might have been\r\nsafely classed among the _dilettanti_. The most remarkable feature of\r\nhis career, however, was the fact that, in spite of his humble calling,\r\nhe became a veritable social dictator, and many an ambitious mother with\r\na thousand-dollar ball upon her hands (this being about the usual sum\r\nspent upon an evening entertainment at that time), lacked the courage to\r\nembark upon such a venture without first seeking an interview with\r\nBrown. I knew but little about his powers of discrimination, as we as a\r\nfamily never found his services necessary, but when requested I know he\r\nfurnished to these dependent hostesses lists of eligible young men whom\r\nhe deemed proficient in the polka and mazurka, the fashionable dances of\r\nthe day. Strange as it may appear, I can vouch for the truth of the\r\nstatement that many an exclusive hostess was glad to avail herself of\r\nthese lists of the accommodating Brown. The dances just mentioned were,\r\nby the way, introduced into this country by Pierro Saracco, an Italian\r\nmaster who taught me to dance, and who was quite popular in the\r\nfashionable circles of his day. Many years later, when I was residing in\r\nMaryland, he came to Frederick several times a week and gave dancing\r\nlessons to my two older daughters.\r\n\r\nBrown was a pleasant, genial, decidedly \"hail-fellow-well-met\" man, as I\r\nremember him, and was in a way the precursor of Ward McAllister, though\r\nof course on a decidedly more unpretentious plane. One cannot but\r\nexpress surprise at the consideration with which Brown's _protégés_ were\r\ntreated by the _élite_, nor can one deny that the social destinies of\r\nmany young men were the direct result of his strenuous efforts. I\r\nremember, for example, one of these who at the time was \"a youth to\r\nfortune and to fame unknown,\" whom Brown took under his sheltering wing\r\nand whose subsequent social career was shaped by him. He is of foreign\r\nbirth, with a pleasing exterior and address and, through the\r\ninstrumentality of his humble friend who gave him his first start, is\r\nto-day, although advanced in life, one of the most conspicuous\r\nfinanciers in New York, and occasionally has private audiences with\r\npresidents and other magnates. Moreover, I feel certain that he will\r\nwelcome this humble tribute to his benefactor with much delight, as the\r\nhalo which now surrounds his brow he owes in a large degree to his early\r\nintroduction into the smart set by the sexton of Grace Church. The last\r\nI ever heard of Brown, he visited Europe. After his return from his\r\nwell-earned holiday he died and was laid to rest in his own native soil.\r\nPeace to Brown's ashes--his work was well done! It cannot be said of\r\nhim, as of many others, that he lived in vain, as he was doubtless the\r\nforerunner of the later and more accomplished leader and dictator of New\r\nYork's \"Four Hundred.\"\r\n\r\nA poetaster paid him the following facetious tribute:\r\n\r\n    Oh, glorious Brown, thou medley strange\r\n      Of churchyard, ballroom, saint, and sinner,\r\n    Flying by morn through fashion's range\r\n      And burying mortals after dinner.\r\n    Walking one day with invitations,\r\n    Passing the next at consecrations,\r\n    Tossing the sod at eve on coffins,\r\n    With one hand drying tears of orphans,\r\n    And one unclasping ballroom carriage,\r\n    Or cutting plumcake up for marriage;\r\n    Dusting by day the pew and missal,\r\n    Sounding by night the ballroom whistle,\r\n    Admitted free through fashion's wicket,\r\n    And skilled at psalms, at punch, and cricket.\r\n\r\nAn amusing anecdote is told of Brown's financial _protégé_ whose name I\r\nhave withheld. When he was still somewhat uncertain of his social status\r\nhe received an invitation to a fancy ball given by a fashionable matron.\r\nThis recognition he regarded as a conspicuous social triumph, and in his\r\ndesire to do the proper thing he sought William R. Travers--\"Bill\r\nTravers,\" as he was generally called--to ask his advice in regard to the\r\nproper costume for him to wear. The inquiring social aspirant had a head\r\nwell-denuded of hair, and Mr. Travers, after a moment's hesitation,\r\nwittingly replied: \"Sugarcoat your head and go as a pill!\"\r\n\r\nThough not a professional wit, Brown was at least capable of making a\r\npun quite equal to those inflicted upon society by some of his\r\nsuperiors. As sexton of Grace Church, he officiated at the wedding of\r\nMiss Phoebe Lord, a daughter of Daniel Lord, whose marriage to Henry\r\nDay, a rising young lawyer, was solemnized in this edifice. At the close\r\nof the reception following the marriage ceremony someone laughingly\r\ncalled upon Brown for a toast. He was equal to the occasion as he\r\nquickly replied: \"This is the Lord's Day!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFASHION AND LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the show places of New York State, many years ago, was the\r\nresidence of John Greig, a polished Scotch gentleman who presided with\r\ndignity over his princely estate in Canandaigua in central New York, and\r\nthere dispensed a generous hospitality. Mr. Greig was the agent for some\r\nof the English nobility, many of whom owned extensive tracts of land in\r\nAmerica. The village of Canandaigua was also the home of the Honorable\r\nFrancis Granger, a son of Gideon Granger, Postmaster General under\r\nJefferson and Madison. Francis Granger was the Postmaster General for a\r\nbrief period under President William Henry Harrison, but the latter died\r\nsoon after his inauguration and his successor did not retain him in his\r\ncabinet. It is said of Francis Granger that he was a firm believer in\r\nthe words of ex-Governor William L. Marcy in the United States Senate in\r\n1832 that \"to the victors belong the spoils of the enemy,\" and that\r\nduring his month of cabinet service eighteen hundred employees in his\r\ndepartment were dismissed. The Democrats evidently thought that \"turn\r\nabout was fair play,\" as a few years later, under President Polk, the\r\nwork of decapitation was equally active. Ransom H. Gillett, Register of\r\nthe Treasury at that time, became so famous at head-chopping, that he\r\nwas soon nicknamed \"Guillotine.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Granger, with his fine physique and engaging manner (he was often\r\ncalled \"the handsome Frank Granger\"), was well adapted to the\r\nrequirements of social life and especially to those of the National\r\nCapital, where the _beaux esprits_ usually congregated. His only\r\ndaughter, Adele Granger, often called \"the witty Miss Granger,\" was at\r\nschool at Madame Chegaray's with my elder sister Fanny, and in my\r\nearlier life was frequently a guest in our Houston Street home, prior to\r\nher sojourn in Washington, where her father for many years represented\r\nhis district in Congress. We looked forward to her visits as one\r\nanticipates with delight a ray of sunshine. She was always assured of\r\nthe heartiest of welcomes in Washington, where she was the center of a\r\nbright and intellectual circle. She finally married Mr. John E. Thayer,\r\na Boston capitalist, and after his death became the wife of the Hon.\r\nRobert C. Winthrop of the same city. She presided with grace over a\r\nsummer home in Brookline and a winter residence in Boston, at both of\r\nwhich she received hosts of distinguished guests. To illustrate the\r\nimportance with which she was regarded, one of her guests remarked to\r\nme, during one of my visits at the Brookline home, that Mrs. Winthrop\r\nwas more than one woman--that in that locality she was considered an\r\n\"institution.\" In the latter part of Mr. Winthrop's life I received a\r\nvery graceful note from him enclosing the following ode written by him\r\nin honor of the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria:\r\n\r\n     BOSTON, MASS.\r\n          90 Marlborough Street, 20 Feb'y 1888.\r\n\r\n     Dear Mrs. Gouverneur:\r\n\r\n     Your kind note and the pamphlet reached me this morning. I\r\n     thank you for them both.\r\n\r\n     I have lost no time in hunting up a spare copy of my little\r\n     Ode on the Queen's Jubilee.\r\n\r\n     I threw it into a newspaper with not a little misgiving.

ROBERT C. WINTHROP.\r\n\r\nAt Geneseo, in the beautiful Genesee Valley, and a few miles from\r\nCanandaigua, in one of the most fertile portions of the State of New\r\nYork, resided a contemporary and friend of Mrs. Robert C. Winthrop, Miss\r\nElizabeth Wadsworth, a daughter of James Wadsworth, a well-known\r\nphilanthropist and one of the wealthiest landed proprietors in the\r\nstate. He was also the father of Major General James S. Wadsworth, a\r\ndefeated candidate for Governor of New York, who was killed in 1864 at\r\nthe battle of the Wilderness. Miss Wadsworth was celebrated for her\r\ngrace of manner. I had the pleasure of knowing her quite well in New\r\nYork, where she generally passed her winters. Quite early in life and\r\nbefore the period when the fair daughters of America had discovered, to\r\nany great extent, the advantages of matrimonial alliances with foreign\r\n_partis_, she married the Honorable Charles Augustus Murray, a member of\r\nthe English Parliament and of a Scotch family, the head of which was the\r\nEarl of Dunmore. She lived but a few years, and died in Egypt, where her\r\nhusband was Consul General, leaving a young son. Her husband's ancestor,\r\nJohn Murray, Lord Dunmore, was the last Colonial Governor of Virginia.\r\nIt has been asserted that but few, if any, Colonial Governors, not even\r\nthe sportive Lord Cornbury of New York who, upon state occasions,\r\ndressed himself up in female attire in compliment to his royal cousin,\r\nQueen Anne, had quite as eventful a career. Lord Dunmore originally came\r\nto America as Governor of the Province of New York, but was subsequently\r\ntransferred to Virginia. While in New York he was made President of the\r\nSt. Andrew's Society, a Scotch organization which had been in existence\r\nabout twenty years and whose first President was Philip Livingston, the\r\nSigner. In an old New York directory of 1798 I find the following names\r\nof officers of this society for the preceding year: Walter Ruturfurde\r\n(sic), President; Peter M'Dougall and George Turnbull, Vice Presidents;\r\nGeorge Douglass, Treasurer; George Johnson, Secretary; John Munro,\r\nAssistant Secretary; the Rev. John M. Mason and the Rev. John Bisset,\r\nChaplains; Dr. James Tillary, Physician; and William Renwick, James\r\nStuart, John Knox, Alexander Thomson, Andrew D. Barclay, and John\r\nM'Gregor, Managers.\r\n\r\nIt was not at all flattering to the pride of Virginia that Lord Dunmore\r\nlingered so long in New York after his order of transfer to the Old\r\nDominion. He also greatly incurred the displeasure of the Virginians by\r\noccasionally dissolving their Assembly, and they found him generally\r\ninimical to their interests. Finally matters were brought to an issue,\r\nand Dunmore, in defense of his conduct, issued a proclamation against \"a\r\ncertain Patrick Henry and his deluded followers.\" His final act was the\r\nburning of Norfolk in 1776, which at that time was the most flourishing\r\ncity in Virginia. During Lord Dunmore's life in Colonial Virginia, a\r\ndaughter was born to him and at the request of the Assembly was named\r\n\"Virginia.\" It is said that subsequently a provision was made by the\r\nProvincial Legislature, by virtue of which she was to receive a very\r\nlarge sum of money when she became of age. Meanwhile, the War of the\r\nRevolution severed the yoke of Great Britain, and Lord Dunmore returned\r\nto England with his family. Time passed and the little girl born in the\r\nVirginia colony grew into womanhood. Her father had died and as her\r\ncircumstances became contracted she addressed a letter to Thomas\r\nJefferson, then President of the United States, under the impression\r\nthat he was Governor of Virginia. Jefferson sent the letter to James\r\nMonroe, who was then Governor of Virginia, and he in turn referred it\r\nto the Legislature of that State. This letter is now in my possession\r\nand is as follows:\r\n\r\n     Sir:\r\n\r\n     I am at a loss how to begin a letter in which I am desirous\r\n     of stating claims that many long years have been forgotten,\r\n     but which I think no time can really annihilate until\r\n     fulfilment has followed the promise. I imagine that you must\r\n     have heard that during my father Dunmore's residence in\r\n     America I was born and that the Assembly, then sitting at\r\n     Williamsburg, requested that I might be their God-daughter\r\n     and christened by the name of Virginia; which request being\r\n     complied with, they purposed providing for me in a manner\r\n     suitable to the honor they conferred upon me and to the\r\n     responsibility they had taken on themselves. I was\r\n     accordingly christened as the God-daughter of that Assembly\r\n     and named after the State. Events have since occurred which\r\n     in some measure may have altered the intentions then\r\n     expressed in my favor. These were (so I have understood)\r\n     that a sum of money should be settled upon me which,\r\n     accumulating during my minority, would make up the sum of\r\n     one hundred thousand pounds when I became of age. It is true\r\n     many changes may have taken place in America, but that fact\r\n     still remains the same. I am still the God-daughter of the\r\n     Virginians. By being that, may I not flatter myself I have\r\n     some claims upon their benevolence if not upon their\r\n     justice? May I not ask that State, especially you, sir,\r\n     their Governor, to fulfil in some respects the engagements\r\n     entered into by their predecessors? Your fathers promised\r\n     mine that I should become their charge. I am totally\r\n     unprovided for; for my father died without making a will. My\r\n     brothers are married, having families of their own; and not\r\n     being bound to do anything for me, they regard with\r\n     indifference my unprotected and neglected situation. Perhaps\r\n     I ought not to mention this circumstance as a proper\r\n     inducement for you to act upon; nor would I, were it not my\r\n     excuse for wishing to remind you of the claims I now\r\n     advance. I hope you will feel my right to your favor and\r\n     protection to be founded on the promises made by your own\r\n     fathers, and in the situation in which I stand with regard\r\n     to the State of Virginia. You will ask, sir, why my appeal\r\n     to your generosity and justice has been so tardy. While my\r\n     father lived, I lived under his protection and guidance. He\r\n     had incurred the displeasure of the Virginians and he feared\r\n     an application from me would have seemed like one from him.\r\n     At his decease I became a free agent. I had taken no part\r\n     which could displease my God-fathers, and myself remained\r\n     what the Assembly had made me--their God-daughter,\r\n     consequently their charge. I wish particularly to enforce my\r\n     dependence upon your bounty; for I feel hopes revive, which\r\n     owe their birth to your honor and generosity, and to that of\r\n     the State whose representative I now address. Now that my\r\n     father is no more, I am certain they and you will remember\r\n     what merited your esteem in his character and conduct and\r\n     forget that which estranged your hearts from so honorable a\r\n     man. But should you not, you are too just to visit what you\r\n     deem the sins of the father upon his luckless daughter.\r\n\r\n          I am, sir, your obt. etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 the small but pretty Gramercy Park in New York was established\r\nby Samuel B. Ruggles. I have heard that this plot of ground was\r\noriginally used as a burying ground by Trinity parish. As I first\r\nrecollect the spot, there were but four or five dwellings in its\r\nvicinity. One of the earliest was built by James W. Gerard, a prominent\r\nlawyer, who was regarded as a most venturesome pioneer to establish his\r\nresidence in such a remote locality. Next door to Mr. Gerard, a few\r\nyears later, lived George Belden, whose daughter Julia married Frederick\r\nS. Tallmadge. Mr. Tallmadge died only a few years ago, highly respected\r\nand esteemed by a large circle of friends.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 I was one of the guests at a fashionable wedding in a residence\r\non the west side of this park, which was possibly the first ceremony of\r\nthe kind to take place in this then remote region. The bride's mother,\r\nthe widow of Richard Armistead of New Bern, N.C., who habitually spent\r\nher winters in New York, had purchased the house only a few months\r\npreviously. The bride, Susan Armistead, was an intimate friend of mine,\r\nand a well-known belle in both the North and the South. The groom, a\r\nresident of New York, was John Still Winthrop, of the same family as the\r\nWinthrops of Massachusetts. The guests composed an interesting\r\nassemblage of the old _régime_, many of whose descendants are now in the\r\nbackground. I met on that occasion many old friends, among whom the\r\nKings, Gracies, Winthrops and Rogers predominated. Mrs. De Witt Clinton\r\nhonored the occasion, dressed in the fashion of a decade or two\r\nprevious. Her presence was a very graceful act as she then but seldom\r\nappeared in society, her only view of the gay world being from her own\r\ndomain. Her peculiarity in regard to dress was very marked as she\r\npositively declined to change it with the prevailing style but clung\r\ntenaciously to the old-fashioned _modes_ to the end of her life. Miss\r\nArmistead was an ideal-looking bride in her white dress and long tulle\r\nveil and carried, according to the custom then prevalent, a large flat\r\nbouquet of white japonicas with white lace paper around the stems. In\r\nthe dining-room, a handsome collation was served, with a huge wedding\r\ncake at one end of the table and pomegranates, especially sent from the\r\nbride's southern home, forming a part of the repast. The health of the\r\nnewly wedded couple was drunk in champagne and good cheer prevailed on\r\nevery side. The whole house bore a happy aspect with its floral\r\ndecorations and its bright Liverpool coal fires burning in the grates.\r\nFurnaces, by the way, were then unknown. In New York there was at that\r\ntime a strong prejudice against anthracite coal, and Liverpool coal was\r\ntherefore generally used, the price of which was fifteen dollars a ton.\r\nI have many close and tender associations connected with this bride of\r\nso many years ago, especially as our friendship, formed in our early\r\nlife, still extends to her descendants. Some years after Mrs. Winthrop's\r\nmarriage, and in her earlier widowhood, four generations traveled\r\ntogether, and then, as at other times, dwelt under the same roof. They\r\nwere Mrs. Nathaniel Smith, Mrs. Richard Armistead, Mrs. John S. Winthrop\r\nand her son, John S. Winthrop, who, with his interesting family, now\r\nresides in Tallahassee.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, Lord Morpeth, the seventh Earl of Carlisle and a worthy\r\nspecimen of the English nobility, visited the United States, and while\r\nhere investigated the subject of the inheritance of slaves by English\r\nsubjects. His report seems to have been favorably received, as a law was\r\npassed subsequent to his return declaring it illegal for Englishmen to\r\nhold slaves through inheritance. England's sympathetic heart about this\r\ntime was in a perennial throb for \"the poor Africans in chains,\"\r\napparently quite oblivious to the fact that the \"chains\" had been\r\nintroduced and cemented by her fostering hand.\r\n\r\nI recall with unusual pleasure an entertainment where Lord Morpeth was\r\nthe guest of honor, at the residence of William Bard on College Place,\r\nat that time a fashionable street in the vicinity of old Columbia\r\nCollege. I have always remembered the occasion as I was then introduced\r\nto Lord Morpeth and enjoyed a long and pleasant conversation with him.\r\nOur host was a son of Dr. Samuel Bard, physician to General Washington\r\nduring the days when New York was the seat of government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. JOHN STILL WINTHROP, NÉE ARMISTEAD, BY SULLY\r\n\r\n_From a portrait owned by John Still Winthrop of Tallahassee._]\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. John Austin Stevens lived on Bleecker Street and had a\r\nnumber of interesting daughters. They were an intellectual family and I\r\nattended an entertainment given by them in honor of Martin Farquhar\r\nTupper, the author of \"Proverbial Philosophy.\" Mr. Stevens' sister,\r\nLucretia Ledyard Stevens, married Mr. Richard Heckscher of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nAnother gentlewoman of the same period was Mrs. Laura Wolcott Gibbs,\r\nwife of Colonel George Gibbs of Newport. The first Oliver Wolcott, a\r\nSigner, Governor of Connecticut and General in the Revolutionary War,\r\nwas her grandfather; while the second of the same name, Secretary of the\r\nTreasury under Washington and Adams, Governor of his State and United\r\nStates Judge, was her father. I am in the fullest sympathy with the\r\nfollowing remarks concerning her made at her funeral by the Rev. Dr.\r\nHenry W. Bellows: \"I confess I always felt in the presence of Mrs. Gibbs\r\nas if I were talking with Oliver Wolcott himself, and saw in her\r\nself-reliant, self-asserting and independent manner and speech an\r\nunmistakable copy of a strong and thoroughly individual character,\r\nforged in the hottest fires of national struggle. The intense\r\nindividuality of her nature set her apart from others. You felt that\r\nfrom the womb she must have been just what she was--a piece of the\r\noriginal granite on which the nation was built.... The force, the\r\ncourage, the self-poise she exhibited in the ordinary concerns of our\r\npeaceful life would in a masculine frame have made, in times of national\r\nperil, a patriot of the most decided and energetic character--one able\r\nand willing to believe all things possible, and to make all the efforts\r\nand sacrifices by which impossibilities are accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gibbs was literally steeped and moulded in the traditions of the\r\npast; in fact, she was a reminder of the noble women of the\r\nRevolutionary era, many of whom have left records behind them. She was\r\ngifted with a keen sense of humor, and her talent in repartee was\r\nproverbial. Although many years my senior, I found delightful\r\ncompanionship in her society, and her home was always a great resource\r\nto me. Her accomplished daughter, the wife of Captain Theophile\r\nd'Oremieulx, U.S.A., was particularly skilled in music. Her son, Wolcott\r\nGibbs, the distinguished Professor of Harvard University, maintained to\r\nthe last the high intellectual standard of his ancestors. He died\r\nseveral years ago. I was informed by his mother that at one period of\r\nits history Columbia College desired to secure his services as a\r\nprofessor, but that the Hon. Hamilton Fish, one of its trustees and an\r\nuncompromising Episcopalian, objected on the ground of his Unitarian\r\nfaith and was sustained by the Board of Trustees. It seemed a rather\r\ninconsistent act, as at another period of its history a Hebrew was\r\nchosen as a member of the same faculty.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as I can remember, it was in the summer of 1845 that I spent\r\nseveral weeks as the guest of the financier and author, Alexander B.\r\nJohnson, in Utica, New York. Mrs. Johnson's maiden name was Abigail\r\nLouisa Smith Adams, and she was the daughter of Charles Adams, son of\r\nPresident John Adams. During my sojourn there her uncle, John Quincy\r\nAdams, came to Utica to visit his relatives, and I had the pleasure of\r\nbeing a guest of the family at the same time. He was accompanied upon\r\nthis trip by his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Charles Francis Adams, a young\r\ngrandson whose name I do not recall, and the father of Mrs. Adams, Peter\r\nC. Brooks, of Boston, another of whose daughters was the wife of Edward\r\nEverett. Upon their arrival in Utica, the greatest enthusiasm prevailed,\r\nand the elderly ex-President was welcomed by an old-fashioned torchlight\r\nprocession. In response to many urgent requests, Mr. Adams made an\r\nimpromptu speech from the steps of the Johnson house, and proved himself\r\nto be indeed \"the old man eloquent.\" Although he was not far from eighty\r\nyears old, he was by no means lacking in either mental or physical\r\nvitality. Mrs. Charles Francis Adams impressed me as a woman of unusual\r\nculture and intellectuality, while her father, Peter C. Brooks, was a\r\ngenial old gentleman whom everyone loved to greet. He was at that time\r\none of Boston's millionaires; and many years later I heard his grandson,\r\nthe late Henry Sidney Everett, of Washington, son of Edward Everett,\r\nsay of him that when he first arrived in Boston he was a youth with\r\nlittle or no means.\r\n\r\nAfter the Adams party had rested for a few days a pleasure trip to\r\nTrenton Falls, in Oneida County, was proposed. A few prominent citizens\r\nof Utica were invited by the Johnsons to accompany the party, and among\r\nthem several well-known lawyers whose careers won for them a national as\r\nwell as local reputation. Among these I may especially mention the\r\nhandsome Horatio Seymour, then in his prime, whose courteous manners and\r\nmanly bearing made him exceptionally attractive. Mr. Adams bore the\r\nfatigue of the trip remarkably well and his strength seemed undiminished\r\nas the day waned. His devoted daughter-in-law remained constantly beside\r\nhim while at the Falls to administer to his comfort and attend to his\r\nwants; in fact, she was so solicitous concerning him that she requested\r\nthat she might, in going and coming, occupy a carriage as near him as\r\npossible. I cannot but regard her as a model for many of the present\r\ngeneration who fail to be deeply impressed by either merit or years.\r\n\r\nThe Adamses were charming guests, and I have always felt that I was\r\nhighly privileged to visit under the same roof with them, and especially\r\nto listen to the words of wisdom of the venerable ex-President. I have\r\nheard it stated, by the way, that during his official life in\r\nWashington, Mr. Adams took a daily bath in the Potomac. This luxury he\r\nmust have missed in Utica, as at this time it offered no opportunities\r\nfor a plunge except in the \"raging canal.\" Mrs. Charles Francis Adams\r\naccompanied her husband when he went to England, during our Civil War,\r\nto represent the United States at the Court of St. James. The consummate\r\nmanner in which he conducted our relations with Great Britain at that\r\ncritical period marked him as an accomplished statesman and a\r\ndiplomatist of the rarest skill. The nature of his task was one of\r\nextreme delicacy, and it is highly probable that, but for his masterly\r\nefforts, England would have recognized the independence of the Southern\r\nConfederacy. The energy and fidelity with which he met the requirements\r\nof his mission undermined his health and, returning to this country, he\r\nretired to his old home in Quincy.\r\n\r\nWhile in Utica I drove in the family carriage with Mrs. Johnson and her\r\nsister, Mrs. John W. King, to Peterboro, about twenty-five miles\r\ndistant, to visit Mr. and Mrs. Gerrit Smith. Mr. Smith had already\r\ncommenced his crusade against slavery, and the family antipathy to the\r\ninstitution was so strong that two of his nieces, sisters of General\r\nJohn Cochrane, who later became President of the Society of the\r\nCincinnati, refused to wear dresses made of cotton because it was a\r\nSouthern staple. As I remember this great anti-slavery agitator, he was\r\na remarkably handsome man with an air of enthusiasm which seemed to\r\npervade his whole being. From 1853 to 1855 he was in Congress, and I had\r\nthe pleasure of listening to one of his scathing speeches on the floor\r\nof the House of Representatives in denunciation of slavery. I recall his\r\nunusual felicity in the use of Scriptural quotations, one of which still\r\nlingers in my ears: \"Where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.\"\r\nHis daughter Elizabeth married Charles Dudley Miller, a prominent\r\ncitizen of Utica. She was a woman of very pronounced views, as may be\r\njudged, in part, by the fact that some years after my marriage, and\r\nwhile living in Washington, I met her by accident one day at the Capitol\r\nand to my surprise discovered that she was wearing bloomers!\r\n\r\nIn September, 1849, I was returning to my home in New York from another\r\nvisit to the Johnsons in Utica, when, upon the invitation of Mrs.\r\nHamilton Fish, whose husband was then Governor of the Empire State, I\r\nstopped in Albany and visited them. They were of course occupying the\r\ngubernatorial mansion, but its exact location I cannot exactly recall.\r\nLife was exceedingly simple in the middle of the last century, even in\r\nthe wealthiest families, and through all these years I seem to remember\r\nbut a single incident connected with the family life of these early\r\nfriends--the trivial fact that the breakfast hour was seven o'clock.\r\nMrs. Fish was a model mother and was surrounded by a large and\r\ninteresting family of children, some of whom are among the highly\r\nprominent people of the present time.\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ of the Fish children, an amusing story is told of the keen\r\nsense of humor of the late William M. Evarts, who presented in every-day\r\nlife such a stern exterior. When, on one occasion, he was a guest of the\r\nFish family at their summer home on the Hudson, his attention was called\r\nto a large and beautifully executed painting of a group of children\r\nwhich, as was quite apparent, was greatly treasured by the ex-Governor.\r\nMr. Evarts gazed upon the portrait for some minutes in silence and then\r\nexclaimed in a low tone, \"little Fishes.\" Mr. Fish stood near his guest\r\nbut, not catching the exact drift of his remark, replied: \"Sir, I do not\r\nunderstand.\" The bright response was: \"Yes, I said little fishes,\r\n_sardines_,\"--reminding one of Artemus Ward's definition of sardines,\r\n\"little fishes biled in ile.\"\r\n\r\nAnother witticism of Mr. Evarts's which seems to me deserving of\r\npreservation is said to have been uttered during his residence in\r\nWashington, when he was Secretary of State under President Hayes. A\r\nparty of distinguished Englishmen was visiting the National Capital and\r\nMr. Evarts escorted it to Mount Vernon. After inspecting the mansion and\r\nthe grave of Washington the party walked to the end of the lawn to view\r\nthe attractive scenery of the Potomac River. One of the Englishmen who\r\nseemed decidedly more conversant with certain phases of American\r\nhistory than the others asked Mr. Evarts whether it were really true\r\nthat Washington could throw a shilling across the Potomac. \"Yes,\" said\r\nMr. Evarts, in a diplomatic tone, \"it is quite true.\" The same evening\r\nat a dinner, the Secretary of State repeated the conversation to a\r\nmutual friend and added: \"He could do even better than that; he could\r\ntoss a Sovereign across the Atlantic!\"\r\n\r\nThe day after my arrival in Albany, President Zachary Taylor and his\r\nsuite were the guests of Governor and Mrs. Fish, and the same day a\r\ndinner was given in his honor which was attended by prominent State\r\nofficials. Meanwhile, a concourse of people had surrounded the mansion,\r\nanxious to see the President and to demand a speech. Old \"Rough and\r\nReady\" appeared at an open window and faced the multitude, but was not\r\nas \"ready\" in speech as with his sword. He made a brave attempt,\r\nhowever, to gratify the people, but he seemed exceedingly feeble and his\r\nvoice was decidedly weak. In the course of his remarks his aide and\r\nson-in-law, Colonel William W. S. Bliss, came to his rescue and prompted\r\nhim, as it were, from behind the scenes; so that everything passed off,\r\nas I understood the next day, to the satisfaction of his audience.\r\nPossibly this was one of Taylor's last appearances in public, as he died\r\nthe following summer.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mrs. Fish was at this time a comparatively young woman, she\r\npresided over the Governor's mansion with the same grace and ease so\r\ncharacteristic of her career in Washington when her husband was\r\nSecretary of State under President Grant. In my opinion, and I know but\r\nfew who had a better opportunity of judging, Mrs. Fish was in many\r\nrespects a remarkable woman. For eight years her home was a social\r\ncenter, and she was regarded as the social dictator of the Grant\r\nadministration. When any perplexing questions of a social nature arose\r\nduring her _régime_, the general inquiry was: \"What does Mrs. Fish\r\nsay?\" This in time became a standing joke, but it illustrates the fact\r\nthat her decisions usually were regarded as final.\r\n\r\nOne of the social leaders in New York during my younger life was Mrs.\r\nIsaac Jones, who, in her own set, was known as \"Bloody Mary.\" Why this\r\nname was applied to her I cannot say, as she was not in the least either\r\ncruel or revengeful, as far as I knew, but on the contrary was suave and\r\ngenial to an unusual degree. She lived on Broadway, directly opposite\r\nthe site where the New York Hotel formerly stood, and her entertainments\r\nwere both numerous and elaborate. She was one of the daughters of John\r\nMason, who began life as a tailor but left at his death an estate valued\r\nat a million dollars, which was a large fortune for those days. Isaac\r\nJones was president of the Chemical Manufacturing Company and later\r\nbecame prominently connected with the Chemical Bank of New York. A\r\nbrother of Mrs. Jones married Miss Emma Wheatley, a superior young woman\r\nwho, unfortunately for her father-in-law's peace of mind, was an\r\nactress. This alliance was most distasteful to the whole Mason\r\nconnection, and when John Mason was approaching death George W. Strong,\r\na prominent lawyer, was hastily summoned by his daughters to draft his\r\nwill. Almost immediately following Mr. Mason's funeral a legal battle\r\nwas commenced over his estate. He left outright to his three daughters\r\ntheir proportionate share of his fortune, but to his son who had\r\ndispleased him by his marriage he devised an annuity of only fifteen\r\nhundred dollars. Charles O'Conor, the counsel for the son, in his\r\nargument in behalf of his client, said that Mr. Mason's daughters,\r\ninstead of sending for a clergyman to console his dying moments, had\r\ndemanded the immediate presence of a respectable lawyer, \"a lawyer so\r\nrespectable that throughout his entire practice he never had a poor\r\nclient.\" Mr. O'Conor succeeded in breaking this will, and young Mason\r\nwas given his proper share in his father's estate.\r\n\r\nOne of John Mason's daughters became the wife of Gordon Hammersley,\r\nwhose son Louis married the beautiful Miss Lilly Warren Price of Troy,\r\nthe daughter of Commodore Cicero Price of the United States Navy. She\r\nsubsequently married the Duke of Marlborough, and afterwards Lord\r\nWilliam Beresford. The Marlborough-Hammersley ceremony was performed in\r\nthis country by a justice of the peace, and the new Duchess of\r\nMarlborough went to England to live upon her husband's depleted estates.\r\nIt is said that she was allowed by her late husband's family an annual\r\nincome of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars; and Blenheim, which\r\nhad long felt the strain of \"decay's effacing fingers,\" began again,\r\nthrough the agency of the Hammersley wealth, to resemble the structure\r\nonce occupied by that tyrant of royalty, the imperious Sarah Jennings.\r\n\r\nVery little seemed to be known about Louis Hammersley, as he lived a\r\nretired life, and when seen in public was almost invariably accompanied\r\nby his father, Gordon Hammersley. When the two appeared upon the street,\r\nthey were sometimes facetiously dubbed \"Dombey and Son.\" They were\r\nfamiliar figures on Broadway, where they invariably walked arm in arm.\r\nJohn Hammersley, a brother of Gordon, was the æsthetic member of this\r\nwell-known family. One of his pet diversions was the giving of unusual,\r\nand sometimes sensational, dinners. To celebrate the completion of the\r\ntrans-continental railroad, he planned what he called a Roman dinner.\r\nHis guests were furnished with togas and partook of the meal in a\r\nreclining position, like the Romans of old. This unique entertainment\r\nwas, of course, thoroughly enjoyed, but did not become _à la mode_ as\r\nthe flowing toga could hardly compete with trim waistcoats and clinging\r\ntrousers, even on festive occasions.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago, more or less, a house was erected in New York on the\r\nsouthwest corner of Fifth Avenue and Fifteenth Street by Mrs. Charles\r\nMaverick Parker, and, to the astonishment of Gothamites, it was said to\r\nhave cost one hundred thousand dollars! Later it became the home of the\r\nManhattan Club. Many old residents visited it on its completion, as such\r\na costly structure was regarded with nothing short of amazement. I\r\nremember it was an _on dit_ of the town that upon one occasion, when\r\nMrs. Parker was personally escorting some unusually prominent person\r\nthrough the mansion, she pointed to a pretty little receptacle in her\r\nbedroom and exclaimed as she passed: \"That is where I keep my old shoes.\r\nI wear old shoes just as other people do.\" The cost and pretentiousness\r\nof her establishment caused her to be nicknamed \"Mrs. House Parker.\" Her\r\nresidence was built of brown stone, which so strongly appealed to the\r\ntaste of New Yorkers that in time the same material was largely employed\r\nin the erection of dwellings. High ceilings were then much in vogue and\r\nwere greatly admired. In our house in Houston Street, where I passed my\r\nlate childhood and early womanhood, the ceilings were unusually high,\r\nwhile all of the doors were of massive mahogany set in ornamental white\r\nframes. In subsequent years I met so many persons who in former days had\r\nbeen our neighbors in Houston Street that I was conceited enough to\r\ndesignate that locality as \"the cradle of the universe.\" Anthony\r\nBleecker Neilson was our next-door neighbor in this famous old street,\r\nand during my life in China twin sons of his, William and Bleecker, were\r\nagain my neighbors in Foo Chow, where they were both employed in the\r\n_Hong_ (firm) of Oliphant & Company.\r\n\r\nA rival to Mrs. Parker's fine house was not long in appearing. Directly\r\nopposite a stately residence was built by Mrs. Richard K. Haight which\r\nsubsequently became the New York Club. A great rivalry existed between\r\nthese two matrons which even extended to hats, feathers, gowns and all\r\nthe furbelows so dear to the feminine heart. In fact, the far-famed\r\nhouses of Montague and Capulet could not have maintained more skillful\r\ntactics; and all the while the Gothamites looked on and smiled. A few\r\nyears later Eugene Shiff, who had spent the greater portion of his life\r\nin France, built a large house on Fifth Avenue which he surmounted with\r\na mansard roof. These pioneers having set the pace, imposing residences\r\nwere erected in rapid succession, and the process has been continued\r\nuntil the present day.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1851, New York was agog over the arrival upon the shores of\r\nAmerica of Louis Kossuth. As everyone knows, he was the leader of the\r\nHungarian revolution of 1848-9, and became the first governor of the\r\nshort-lived Hungarian Republic. When this was overthrown by Austria and\r\nother countries, Kossuth fled to Turkey and subsequently sailed for this\r\ncountry on the U.S. Frigate _Mississippi_. When his arrival became\r\nknown, thousands of people thronged the streets anxious to catch a first\r\nglimpse of the distinguished foreigner. One might have fancied from the\r\nenthusiasm displayed that he was one of our own conquering heroes\r\nreturning home. Americans were even more sympathetic then than now with\r\nall struggles for political freedom, as the history of our own trying\r\nexperiences during the Revolution was, from a sentimental point of view,\r\neven more of a controlling influence than it is to-day. Several months\r\nlater I heard Kossuth deliver an address at the National Hotel in\r\nWashington before a large assembly chiefly composed of members of\r\nCongress, when his subject was \"Hungary and her woes.\" I vividly recall\r\nthe impression produced upon his audience when, in his deeply melodious\r\ntones, he invoked the \"Throne of Grace\" and closed with the appealing\r\nwords: \"What is life without prayer?\" I have never before or since\r\nobserved an audience so completely under the sway of an orator, as it\r\nseemed to me that there was not a person in the room who at the moment\r\nwould not have been willing to acquiesce in whatever demands or appeals\r\nhe might present. Kossuth's countenance suggested such profound\r\ndepression that one could readily credit the assertion he made during\r\nhis remarks, \"I have been trained to grief.\" He wore during the delivery\r\nof his address the picturesque costume of the Magyars of his country.\r\n\r\nNew York had an unusually large coterie of _littérateurs_, many of whom\r\nit was my good fortune to know. Some of these had only recently returned\r\nfrom Brook Farm \"sadder but wiser\" and, at all events, with more\r\npractical views concerning \"the world's broad field of battle.\" Brook\r\nFarm had its origin in 1841, and completely collapsed in 1847. It was\r\nchiefly intended to be the fulfillment of a dream of the Rev. Dr.\r\nWilliam Henry Channing of \"an association in which the members, instead\r\nof preying upon one another and seeking to put one another down, after\r\nthe fashion of this world, should live together as brothers, seeking one\r\nanother's elevation and spiritual growth.\" It was essentially\r\nsocialistic in its conception and execution and, although professedly\r\naltruistic in its nature, was in reality a visionary scheme which\r\nreflected but little credit upon the judgment of either its originators\r\nor its patrons. Its company was composed of \"members\" and \"scholars,\" to\r\nwhom may be added a celebrated list of those who sojourned at the Farm\r\nfor brief periods and were known as \"visitors.\" The whole scheme was\r\nwithout doubt one of the most visionary expressions of New England\r\ntranscendentalism, and it failed because in the nature of things no such\r\nventures ever have succeeded and, until human nature is essentially\r\nrevolutionized, probably never can. Among its most distinguished members\r\nwere Nathaniel Hawthorne, Charles A. Dana, later the brilliant and\r\naccomplished editor of _The New York Sun_, and George Ripley. George\r\nWilliam Curtis was one of its scholars, and among its visitors were the\r\nRev. William Henry Channing, Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Amos\r\nBronson Alcott, Orestes Augustus Bronson, Theodore Parker and Elizabeth\r\nP. Peabody--forming together one of the most brilliant intellectual\r\ngalaxies that were ever associated in a single enterprise.\r\n\r\nOf this number I especially recall George William Curtis, a genius of\r\nthe first brilliancy and remarkable withal for his versatile\r\nconversational powers. I was talking to him on one occasion when someone\r\ninquired as to his especial work in the co-operative fold of Brook Farm.\r\nHis laughing reply was, \"Cleaning door knobs.\" George Ripley was a\r\ndistinguished scholar and a prominent journalist. His wife, a daughter\r\nof Francis Dana, became a convert to Catholicism and is said to have\r\nfound much to console her in that faith until her death from cancer in\r\n1861. Margaret Fuller, though not possessed of much outward grace, was a\r\nprolific votary of the pen. I occasionally met her in society before she\r\nstarted on an European tour where she met her destiny in the person of\r\nthe Marquis Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, to whom she was secretly married in\r\n1847. Some years later she embarked with her husband and little boy upon\r\na sailing vessel for America, and all were lost off the coast of New\r\nYork in July, 1850. Horace Sumner, a younger brother of the\r\ndistinguished Massachusetts statesman, also perished at the same time.\r\n\r\nAbout 1845 I met Anne C. Lynch of Providence, who came to New York to\r\npromote her literary ambitions, and was a pleasing addition to this same\r\nintellectual circle. She was the author of several prose works and also\r\nof some poetical effusions which were published in 1848 and received\r\nhigh commendation. She married Vincenzo Botta, a learned Italian who at\r\none time was a professor in the University of Turin. Their tastes were\r\nsimilar and the marriage was a very happy one. They lived for many\r\nyears on Thirty-seventh Street in New York, where they maintained a\r\ncharming _salon_. On Sunday evenings their home was the rendezvous of\r\nmany of the literary lights of the metropolis as well as of\r\ndistinguished strangers. Some years before her marriage, Mrs. Botta was\r\nvisiting in Washington, where she formed a friendship with Henry Clay.\r\nUpon her return to New York he committed to her care a valuable gold\r\nmedal, but upon arriving at her home she discovered to her dismay that\r\nit was missing from her trunk. It was the general impression that it had\r\nbeen stolen from her on her way to New York. About the same time I also\r\nknew Donald G. Mitchell (\"Ik Marvel\"), but this was before he had\r\nentered upon his active and distinguished literary career, and when he\r\nwas a temporary sojourner in New York. He was contributing at that time\r\nsome much appreciated letters to various magazines under the signature\r\nof \"The Lorgnette,\" which were subsequently republished as a volume\r\nbearing the same title.\r\n\r\nN. P. Willis was another literary genius of the same period whom I had\r\nthe pleasure of knowing. He was cordially welcomed into the social world\r\nof New York; but, unfortunately for his popularity, he wrote a prose\r\neffusion entitled, \"Those Ungrateful Blidgimses,\" which was generally\r\nrecognized as a direct attack upon two old ladies who were held in high\r\nesteem in New York. It was known to many persons that he had had a\r\nmisunderstanding with them and that he had employed this manner of\r\ntaking his revenge. New York society frowned upon what was generally\r\nconsidered his ungallant conduct, and for many years the doors of some\r\nof the most prominent houses in the city were closed against him. As I\r\nremember reading his story at the time, I thought its title was but a\r\npoor disguise, as the sisters were named Bridgens, the christian name of\r\none of them being Cornelia. This name was distorted into \"Crinny,\" who,\r\nby the way, was a woman of decided ability. It was against her that the\r\nauthor's animosity was chiefly directed. It seems that the Misses\r\nBridgens and Mr. Willis chanced to be sojourning at the same time in\r\nRome, where the scene of his narrative is laid. Miss Crinny was a\r\nsufferer from an attack of Roman fever and, under these dire\r\ncircumstances, Mr. Willis represents himself as her attendant, and in\r\nthis capacity refuses to condone the peculiarities of the poor old\r\nlady's sick-room. His patience in gratifying her morbid fancies is\r\ngraphically described in a vein of ridicule and he tells how by the hour\r\nhe threaded what he terms her \"imaginary locks.\" He also dwells at\r\nlength upon her conversational powers and likens her tongue to the\r\nelasticity of an eel's tail, which would wag if it were skinned and\r\nfried. Charles Dudley Warner has described this writing of Mr. Willis as\r\n\"funny but wicked\"; it was more than that--it was cruel! Willis made\r\nanother reference to the two sisters in his \"Earnest Clay\" where he\r\nspeaks of \"two abominable old maids by the names of Buggins and\r\nBlidgins, representing the _scan. mag._ of Florence.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York public was in no hurry to reopen its doors to Mr. Willis;\r\nindeed, it was not until after his marriage to Miss Cornelia Grinnell,\r\nhis second wife, that he was again kindly received. I recall with much\r\npleasure a visit I made at Mrs. Winfield Scott's in New York, after that\r\ncity had ceased to be my home, when we went together to dine with Mr.\r\nand Mrs. N. P. Willis at Idlewild, their country home on the Hudson.\r\nThese were the days when Mrs. Scott was sometimes facetiously called\r\n_Madame la Général_. This charming residence of Mr. Willis was several\r\nmiles south of Newburgh, on high ground overlooking the river, and from\r\nits porches there was an enchanting view of West Point. Mr. Willis told\r\nus that when he first came to that vicinity he called the attention of\r\na countryman from whom he had purchased the land to some uncultivated\r\nacres and asked a suggestion regarding them. \"That,\" said the man,\r\nwaving his hand in the direction of the trees, \"is nothing but an\r\nIdlewild.\" The word lingered in Mr. Willis's mind, and he subsequently\r\nadopted it as the name of his new home.\r\n\r\nWhile living in New York we frequently attended parties at the\r\nhospitable home of Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin F. Butler in Washington Place.\r\nHe was an elegant gentleman of the old school and had served as Attorney\r\nGeneral in the cabinets of Presidents Jackson and Van Buren. They were\r\npeople of deep religious convictions, and consequently all their\r\nentertainments were conducted upon the strictest code of the day. For\r\nexample, dancing was never permitted and wine was never served. In place\r\nof dancing there was a continuous promenade. I generally attended these\r\nparties accompanied by my father, who enjoyed meeting the legal lights\r\nof the country, some of whom were always there. Exceptionally handsome\r\nsuppers were served at these entertainments, and every effort was made\r\nby Mr. and Mrs. Butler to make up, as it were, for the lack of dancing\r\nwhich was sorely missed by those more gayly inclined.\r\n\r\nA hundred thousand dollars was considered a highly respectable fortune\r\nin New York between sixty and seventy years ago. Seven per cent, was the\r\nusual rate of interest, the cost of living was low, and life was, of\r\ncourse, much simpler in every way. I recall a prominent young man about\r\nthis period, Henry Carroll Marx, commonly called \"Dandy Marx,\" who was\r\nsaid to be the happy possessor of the amount I have named. He was\r\ndevoted to horses and from his home on Broadway he could frequently be\r\nseen driving tandem on the cobblestone streets. I do not remember his\r\nentering the social arena; possibly he avoided it in order to escape the\r\nwiles of designing mothers, whom one occasionally encountered even in\r\nthose ancient days. His faultless attire, which in elegance surpassed\r\nall his rivals, won for him the nickname of \"Dandy.\" He also rendered\r\nhimself conspicuous as the first gentleman in New York to wear the long,\r\nstraight, and pointed waxed mustache. His two maiden sisters were\r\ninseparable companions and nearly every day could be seen walking on\r\nBroadway. Miss Lydia Kane, one of the wits of my day and of whom I have\r\nalready spoken, facetiously called them \"number 11\"--two straight marks!\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Burton's Theater was an unfailing source of delight to the\r\npleasure-loving public. William E. Burton was an Englishman of rare\r\ncultivation, and was the greatest comedian New York had ever known.\r\nAlthough so gifted, his expression of countenance was one of extreme\r\ngravity. His presentation of Aminadab Sleek in the \"Serious Family\" has,\r\nin my opinion, never been surpassed. He frequently acted in minor\r\ncomedies, but the \"Serious Family\" was his greatest _rôle_. Niblo's\r\nGarden on Broadway, near Houston Street, was a source of great delight\r\nin those days to all Gothamites. It was in this theater that the Ravel\r\nfamily had its remarkable athletic performances. When I recall their\r\ngraceful, youthful physiques, I am reminded of Hamlet's philosophical\r\nmusings in the graveyard: \"Where be your gibes now, your gambols, your\r\nsongs, your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a\r\nroar?\" P. T. Barnum was a conspicuous figure about this time. His museum\r\nwas on Broadway, at the corner of Ann Street, and not far from the City\r\nHall. He was considered a prince of humbugs and perhaps gloried in his\r\nreputation as such. I distinctly remember the excitement which he\r\ncreated over a mummified old colored woman who, he asserted, had been a\r\nnurse of Washington, and to whom he gave the name of Joice Heth. She was\r\nundoubtedly a very aged negress, but she still retained full powers of\r\narticulation and was well coached to reply in an intelligent manner to\r\nthe numerous inquiries respecting her pretended charge. It is needless\r\nto add that she was only one of Barnum's numerous fakes.\r\n\r\nPhilip Kearny, a handsome gentleman of a former school, who lived at the\r\ncorner of Broadway and Leonard Street, was a lavish entertainer. He was\r\na widower when I knew him, but his daughter, the wife of Major Alexander\r\nS. Macomb, U.S.A., the son and aide of Major General Alexander Macomb,\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army, lived with him. Major Macomb was\r\nconspicuous for his attractive personality and imposing presence and was\r\nsaid to bear a striking resemblance to Prince Albert, the father of\r\nEdward VII. His wife was one of the three heirs of John Watts, who owned\r\na princely estate. The other two were her brother, the gallant General\r\nPhilip Kearny, and her cousin, General John Watts de Peyster, a son of\r\nthat most accomplished gentleman, Frederick de Peyster, of whom I have\r\nalready spoken. Mrs. Macomb was a generous and attractive woman who\r\ndispensed with a liberal hand the wealth she had inherited. Her pretty\r\ncousins, Mary and Nancy Kearny, whom I knew quite well, daughters of her\r\nfather's brothers, were her constant guests. Another frequent visitor of\r\nthis household was Mrs. \"Phil\" Kearny, as she was invariably called,\r\nwhose maiden name was Diana Moore Bullitt, a famous Kentucky belle,\r\nwell-known for her grace and intellectual attractions. Her sister\r\nEloise, usually called \"Lou\" Bullitt by her intimate friends, married\r\nBaron Frederick de Kantzow of Sweden, a courtly foreigner who had\r\ncommercial relations with the merchant princes of New York. Tradition\r\nstates that the Baroness de Kantzow, though not possessed of Mrs.\r\nKearny's beauty, was a more successful slayer of hearts than her sister,\r\nand it is said that she had adorers by the score. A third Bullitt\r\nsister, Mary, married General Henry Atkinson and after his death Major\r\nAdam Duncan Steuart, both of the United States Army, the latter of whom\r\nwas stationed for many years at Fort Leavenworth.\r\n\r\nMrs. Macomb's health failed at an early period of life and to restore it\r\nshe sought a foreign clime; but, alas, her many friends were never\r\ngladdened again by her kindly welcome, as she died abroad. In my young\r\nwomanhood I frequently attended parties at the Kearny house where\r\ndancing and other social pleasures enlivened the scene. In this\r\nconnection it seems proper to refer at greater length to John Watts and\r\nhis interesting trio of daughters. I have already spoken of his son\r\nRobert, who died unmarried at an early age. His two older daughters,\r\nSusanna, wife of Philip Kearny, and Mary Justina, wife of Frederick de\r\nPeyster, did not long survive their marriages; but a third daughter,\r\nElizabeth, the wife of Henry Laight, who never had children, lived many\r\nyears with her father and managed the affairs of his household. An\r\namusing story was told me many years ago regarding Mrs. Laight which is\r\nwell worthy of mention. As a young girl she was deeply in love with the\r\nyoung man who eventually became her husband, but her father was so\r\ndevoted to her and so very dependent upon her that he violently opposed\r\nher marrying anyone. Accordingly, a secret marriage was planned by the\r\nyoung people to take place in Trinity Church. As the youthful pair was\r\nstanding in front of the altar, surrounded by a few sympathetic friends,\r\nthe rector reached the words, \"Who giveth this woman to be married to\r\nthis man?\" when, to the astonishment of the assembled group, a gruff,\r\nloud voice in the rear of the church shouted \"I do.\" Old John Watts had\r\nopposed his daughter's marriage with all his might, but when he learned\r\nby chance that she was to be married clandestinely, he graciously\r\naccepted the inevitable and without the knowledge of anyone hurried to\r\nthe church and, entering it by a side door, duly performed his part as\r\njust related. This anecdote was told me by Arent Schuyler de Peyster, a\r\ndistant cousin of General John Watts de Peyster. Many years later, when\r\nI repeated it to Mrs. Diana Bullitt Kearny, she remarked in her\r\ncharacteristic manner: \"He was mean enough not to even allow her the\r\nsatisfaction of a runaway marriage.\" This estimate of his character,\r\nhowever, does not seem to agree with that given by others. The Laights\r\nwere prominent in New York society. One of them, Edward Laight, whom I\r\nknew as a society beau, was remarkably handsome. He was a good deal of a\r\nflirt and transferred his affections with remarkable facility from one\r\nyoung woman to another. His sister married a Greek, Mr. Eugene Dutilh, a\r\ngentleman of culture and refinement, who owned a beautiful place at\r\nGarrison's-on-the-Hudson which he sold about 1861 to Hamilton Fish.\r\n\r\nPhilip Kearny and his family lived next door to Peter A. Jay, and I\r\nfrequently met the young people of his household at Mrs. Macomb's\r\nparties. Gouverneur Morris, a son of the distinguished statesman, and\r\nEdward Kearny were _habitués_ of this establishment, as were also Ridley\r\nand Essex Watts, both of whom I knew well. General \"Phil\" Kearny from\r\nhis youthful days was an enthusiastic soldier, but he was not a graduate\r\nof West Point, having been appointed to the regular army from civil life\r\nby President Van Buren in 1837. He served throughout the Mexican War,\r\nwhere he had the misfortune to lose an arm at the battle of Churubusco,\r\nand was killed during the Civil War in 1862 at the battle of Chantilly.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of General Macomb, I am reminded of a social _on dit_ of many\r\nyears ago. Mrs. August Belmont (Caroline Slidell Perry) lived in a fine\r\nhouse on Fifth Avenue and frequently gave large receptions. His sister,\r\nSarah Perry, subsequently Mrs. R. S. Rodgers, was an early friend of\r\nmine. The elegant Major Alexander S. Macomb, who was his father's\r\nnamesake and aide, on entering Mrs. Belmont's drawing-room was\r\nunfortunate enough to brush against a handsome vase and completely\r\nshatter it. It was generally conceded that his hostess was conscious of\r\nthe disaster, but \"was mistress of herself though China fall\" and\r\nappeared entirely unconscious of the mishap. Some months later at the\r\nhouse of Lady Cunard (Mary McEvers), a similar accident happened. The\r\nunfortunate guest, however, in this case was immediately approached by\r\nhis hostess, who with much elegant grace begged him not to be disturbed\r\nas the damage was trifling. Immediately society began an animated\r\ndiscussion, when even the judicial powers of Solomon might have found it\r\nembarrassing to decide which of the two women should be accorded the\r\ngreater degree of _savoir faire_.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, accompanied by my father, I attended the wedding of Estelle\r\nLivingston, daughter of John Swift Livingston, to John Watts de Peyster.\r\nAt the time of this marriage, Mr. de Peyster was considered the finest\r\n_parti_ in the city; while, apart from his great wealth, he was so\r\nunusually talented that it was generally believed a brilliant future\r\nawaited him. It was a home wedding, and the drawing-room was well filled\r\nwith the large family connection and other invited guests. At this time\r\nMr. Livingston was a widower, but his sister Maria, Mrs. John C. Stevens\r\nof Hoboken, did the honors of the occasion for her brother. The young\r\nbride presented a charming appearance in all her finery, and at the\r\nbountiful collation following the ceremony champagne flowed freely.\r\nThis, however, was no unusual thing, as that beverage was generally seen\r\nat every entertainment in those good old days. Mrs. John C. Stevens\r\nlived at one time in Barclay Street, and I have heard numerous stories\r\nconcerning her eccentricities. In 1849 she gave a fancy-dress ball but,\r\nas she had failed to revise her visiting list in many years, persons who\r\nhad long been dead were among her invited guests. She was especially\r\npeculiar in her mode of dress, which was not always adapted to her\r\nsocial position. It is therefore not at all surprising that unfortunate\r\nmistakes were occasionally made in regard to her identity. Another of\r\nher eccentricities consisted in the fact that she positively refused,\r\nwhen shopping, to recognize even her most intimate friends, as she said\r\nit was simply impossible for her to combine business with pleasure. In\r\nspite of her peculiarities, however, she possessed unusual social charm.\r\nHer husband was prominent in society and business circles. He was\r\nfounder of the New York Yacht Club as well as its first president, and\r\ncommanded the _America_ in the memorable race in England in 1851, which\r\nwon the celebrated cup that Sir Thomas Lipton and other English\r\nyachtsmen have failed to restore to their native land. Mary Livingston,\r\nthe younger daughter of John Swift Livingston, was a _petite_ beauty.\r\nShe married a distant relative, a son of Maturin Livingston. I am told\r\nthat her brother, Johnston Livingston, is still living in New York at a\r\nvery advanced age.\r\n\r\nJoseph Kemmerer's band was an indispensable adjunct to all social\r\ngatherings in the days of which I am speaking. The number of instruments\r\nused was always in proportion to the size of the entertainment. The\r\ninspiring airs of Strauss and Labitzky, then in vogue, were popular with\r\nthe younger set. These airs bring back pleasant memories, as I have\r\nfrequently danced to them. The waltz in my day was a fine art and its\r\nvotaries were numerous. I recall the fact that Edward James of Albany, a\r\nwitty young gentleman with whom I occasionally danced, was such a\r\ndevotee to the waltz that, not possessing sufficient will power to\r\nresist its charms and having a delicate constitution, he nearly danced\r\nhimself into another world. Two attractive young brothers, Thomas H. and\r\nDaniel Messinger, who were general beaux in society, played their parts\r\nmost successfully in the social world by their graceful dancing, and no\r\nball was considered complete without their presence. These brothers\r\nwere associated in the umbrella industry, and Miss Lydia Kane, some of\r\nwhose witty remarks I have already quoted, dubbed them the \"reigning\r\nbeaux!\" Daniel Messinger eventually married Miss Elizabeth Coles\r\nNeilson, a daughter of Anthony Bleecker Neilson, and became a Lieutenant\r\nColonel in the Union Army during the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe British Consul General in New York from 1817 to 1843 was James\r\nBuchanan. He was Irish by birth, and many young British subjects\r\nvisiting the United States made his home their headquarters. He had\r\nseveral daughters and, as the whole family was social in its tastes, I\r\noften enjoyed meeting these sturdy representatives of John Bull at his\r\nhouse. Those I knew best came from \"the land of brown heath and shaggy\r\nwood,\" as in our family we were naturally partial to Scotchmen and, as a\r\nrule, regarded them as desirable acquaintances. Many of these were\r\ngraduates of Glasgow University and young men of unusual culture and\r\nrefinement. I especially remember Mr. McCorquodale, a nephew of Dr.\r\nThomas Chalmers, the distinguished Presbyterian Divine of Scotland. He\r\nmet his future wife in New York in the person of a wealthy and\r\nattractive widow. Her maiden name I do not recall, although I am\r\nacquainted with certain facts concerning her lineage. She was the\r\ngranddaughter of Madame de Genlis.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether any of these young Scotchmen whom I met remained\r\npermanently in this country, as they always seemed too loyal to the\r\n\"Land o' Cakes\" to entirely expatriate themselves. Another young\r\nScotchman, Mr. Dundas, whom I knew quite well through the Buchanans,\r\nembarked for his native land on board the steamer _President_. This ship\r\nsailed in the spring of 1841 and never reached her destination. What\r\nbecame of her was never known and her fate remains to this day one of\r\nthe mysteries of the sea. In the fall of 1860 the U.S. man-of-war\r\n_Levant_, on her voyage from the Hawaiian Islands to Panama, disappeared\r\nin the same mysterious manner in the Pacific Ocean; and, as was the case\r\nwith the _President_, no human being aboard of her was ever heard of\r\nagain. There were many conjectures in regard to the fate of this ship,\r\nbut the true story of her doom has never been revealed. I remember two\r\nof the officers who perished with her. One of them was Lieutenant Edward\r\nC. Stout, who had married a daughter of Commodore John H. Aulick,\r\nU.S.N., and whose daughters, the Misses Julia and Minnie Stout, are well\r\nremembered in Washington social circles; and the other was Purser Andrew\r\nJ. Watson, who was a member of one of the old residential families of\r\nthe District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON IN THE FORTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first visit to Washington was in 1845. I started from New York at\r\neight o'clock in the morning and reached Philadelphia late the same\r\nafternoon. I broke the journey by spending the night at Jones's Hotel in\r\nthe lower part of the city, which was the usual stopping place of\r\ntravelers who made this trip. A few years later when the journey from\r\nNew York to Washington was made in twelve hours, it was thought that\r\nalmost a miracle had been performed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Winfield Scott in 1855 characterized the National Capital as \"an\r\nill-contrived, ill-arranged, rambling, scrambling village\"; and it was\r\ncertainly all of that when I first saw it. It is not improbable that the\r\ncause of this condition of affairs was a general feeling of uncertainty\r\nas to whether Washington would remain the permanent seat of government,\r\nespecially as the West was naturally clamoring for a more centrally\r\nlocated capital. When I first visited the city the ubiquitous\r\nreal-estate agent had not yet materialized, and corner lots, now so much\r\nin demand, could be purchased at a small price. Taxation was moderate\r\nand Congress, then as now, held itself responsible for one-half of the\r\ntaxes. As land was cheap there was no necessity for economy in its use,\r\nand spacious fronts were built regardless of back-buildings. In other\r\ncases, when one's funds were limited, the rear of the house was first\r\nbuilt and later a more imposing front was added. The contrast between\r\nthe houses of New York, built closely together in blocks, and those in\r\nWashington, with the abundant space around them, was a great surprise\r\nto me. Unlike many other cities, land in Washington, then, as now, was\r\nsold and taxed by the square foot.\r\n\r\nMy elder sister Fanny had married Charles Eames, Esq., of the Washington\r\nBar, and my visit was to her. Mr. Eames entered Harvard in 1827 when\r\nless than sixteen years of age, and was a classmate of Wendell Phillips\r\nand of John Lothrop Motley, the historian. The distinguished Professor\r\nof Harvard University, Andrew P. Peabody, LL.D., in referring to him\r\nmany years after his death said that he was \"the first scholar of his\r\nclass, and was regarded as a man of unlimited power of acquisition, and\r\nof marked ability as a public speaker.\" After leaving Harvard he studied\r\nlaw, but ill health prevented him from practicing his profession. He\r\naccompanied to Washington George Bancroft, President Polk's Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, by whom he was made principal correspondence clerk of the Navy\r\nDepartment. He remained there but a few months when he became associate\r\neditor of _The Washington Union_ under the well-known Thomas Ritchie,\r\nusually known as \"Father Ritchie.\" He was subsequently appointed by Polk\r\na commissioner to negotiate a treaty with the Hawaiian Islands, and took\r\npassage upon the U.S. Frigate _Savannah_ and sailed, by way of Cape\r\nHorn, for San Francisco. He unexpectedly found awaiting his arrival in\r\nthat city Dr. Gerrit P. Judd, Prime Minister of the King, with two young\r\nHawaiian princes. After the treaty was made, he returned east and for\r\nsix months edited _The Nashville Union_, when he again assumed charge of\r\n_The Washington Union_. President Pierce subsequently appointed him\r\nMinister to Venezuela, where he remained until 1859, and then returned\r\nto Washington, where he practiced his profession for the remainder of\r\nhis life. It was while arguing an important case before the Supreme\r\nCourt that he was stricken, and he died on the 16th of March, 1867. He\r\nsustained a high reputation as an admiralty lawyer as well as for his\r\nknowledge of international jurisprudence. I have now before me a letter\r\naddressed to his widow by Wendell Phillips only three days after his\r\ndeath. It is one of the valued possessions of Mr. Eames's daughter, who\r\nis my niece and the wife of that genial Scotchman, Alexander Penrose\r\nGordon-Cumming. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n     QUINCY, Illinois, March 19, 1867.\r\n\r\n     My dear friend,\r\n\r\n     I have just crossed from the other side of the Mississippi,\r\n     and am saddened by learning from the papers my old and dear\r\n     friend's death.\r\n\r\n     The associations that bind us together go back many, many\r\n     years. We were boys together in sunny months full of frolic,\r\n     plans and hopes. The merriment and the seriousness, the toil\r\n     and the ambition of those days all cluster round him as\r\n     memory brings him to me in the flush of his youth. I have\r\n     seen little of him of late years, as you know, but the roots\r\n     of our friendship needed no constant care; they were too\r\n     strong to die or wilt, and when we did meet it was always\r\n     with the old warmth and intimacy. I feel more alone in the\r\n     world now he has gone. One by one the boy's comrades pass\r\n     over the river and life loses with each some of its\r\n     interest.\r\n\r\n     I was hoping in coming years, as life grew less busy, to see\r\n     more of my old playmate, and this is a very unexpected blow.\r\n     Be sure I sympathize with you most tenderly, and could not\r\n     resist the impulse to tell you so. Little as we have met, I\r\n     owe to your kind and frank interest in me a sense of very\r\n     warm and close relation to you--feel as if I had known you\r\n     ever so many years. I hope our paths may lead us more\r\n     together so that I may learn to know you better and gather\r\n     some more distinct ideas of Eames' later years. All his\r\n     youth I have by heart.\r\n\r\n          With most affectionate regards believe me\r\n\r\n               Very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n               WENDELL PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Eames.\r\n\r\n     I think women never fully realize the strange tenderness\r\n     with which men cling to college mates. No matter how much\r\n     opinions or residence separate grown-up men, to have been\r\n     classmates is a tie that like blood never loosens. Any man\r\n     that has a heart feels it thrill at the sight of one of\r\n     _those_ comrades. Later friendships may be close, never so\r\n     tender--this makes boys of us again at any moment.\r\n     Unfamiliar tears obey its touch, and a singular sense of\r\n     loneliness settles down on survivors--Good-bye.\r\n\r\nThe young Hawaiian princes to whom I have just referred and who, by the\r\nway, were mere boys, accompanied Dr. Judd to New York where my younger\r\nbrother, Malcolm, thinking he might make the acquaintance of some genial\r\nplaymates, called to see them. Upon his return from his visit his only\r\ncriticism was, \"those dusky princes certainly give themselves airs.\"\r\n\r\nMy sister, Mrs. Eames, lived in a house on G Street near Twenty-first\r\nStreet in what was then known as the First Ward. This general section,\r\ntogether with a part of Indiana Avenue, some portions of Capitol Hill,\r\nSixth and Seventh Streets, and all of that part of the city bounded on\r\nthe north by K Street, on the south by Pennsylvania Avenue, and westward\r\nof Fourteenth Street to Georgetown, was at this time the fashionable\r\nsection of the city. Like many other places in its formative period,\r\nWashington then presented the picture of fine dwelling houses and\r\nshanties standing side by side. I remember, for example, that as late as\r\n1870 a fine residence on the corner of I and Fifteenth Streets was\r\nlocated next to a small frame house occupied by a colored undertaker.\r\nThe latter's business was prosperous, but his wealthy neighbor objected\r\nto the constant reminder of death caused by seeing from his fine bay\r\nwindow the numerous coffins carried in and out. He asked the undertaker\r\nto name his price for his property, but he declined, and all of his\r\nsubsequent offers were ignored. Finally, after several years' patient\r\nwaiting, during which offer after offer had been politely but positively\r\nrejected, the last one being an almost princely sum, the owner sold his\r\nhome and moved away, leaving his humble neighbor in triumphant\r\npossession. This is simply a fair example of the conditions existing in\r\nWashington when I first knew it.\r\n\r\nTwo rows of houses on Pennsylvania Avenue, known as the \"Six and Seven\r\nBuildings,\" were fashionable dwellings. Admiral David D. Porter, then a\r\nLieutenant in the Navy, occupied one of them. Miss Catharine L. Brooke\r\nkept a girls' school in another, while still another was the residence\r\nof William Lee of Massachusetts. I have been informed that while serving\r\nin a consular office abroad, under the appointment of President Monroe,\r\nMr. Lee was commissioned by him to select a dinner set for the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nArchitects, if I remember correctly, were almost unknown in Washington\r\nat this time. When a person was sufficiently venturesome to build a\r\nhouse for himself, he selected a residence suited to his tastes and\r\ndirected a builder to erect one like it. Speculative building was\r\nentirely unknown, and if any resident of the District had embarked upon\r\nsuch a venture he would have been regarded as the victim of a vivid but\r\ndisordered fancy.\r\n\r\nMrs. C. R. Latimer kept a fashionable boarding house in a large brick\r\ndwelling facing Lafayette Square where the Belasco Theater now stands.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hamilton Fish boarded with her while the former was a\r\nRepresentative in Congress, and Mr. and Mrs. Sanders Irving, so well and\r\nfavorably known to all old Washingtonians, also made this house their\r\nhome. Many years later it was the residence of William H. Seward, and he\r\nwas living there when the memorable attempt was made in 1865 to\r\nassassinate him. As is well known, it subsequently became the home of\r\nJames G. Blaine. When Hamilton Fish was elected to the Senate, he\r\npurchased a house on H Street, between Seventeenth and Eighteenth\r\nStreets, which was afterwards known as the \"Porter house.\" Previously\r\nit had been owned and occupied by General \"Phil\" Kearny.\r\n\r\nThe shops of Washington in 1845 were not numerous, and were located\r\nchiefly upon Pennsylvania Avenue, Seventh Street then being a\r\nresidential section. The most prominent dry-goods store was kept by\r\nDarius Clagett at the corner of Ninth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue.\r\nMr. Clagett, invariably cordial and courteous, always stood behind his\r\ncounter, and I have had many pleasant chats with him while making my\r\npurchases. Although he kept an excellent selection of goods, it was\r\nusually the custom for prominent Washington folk to make their larger\r\npurchases in Baltimore. A little later Walter Harper kept a dry-goods\r\nstore on Pennsylvania Avenue, near Eighth Street, and some years later\r\ntwo others appeared, one kept by William M. Shuster on Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue, first between Seventh and Eighth Streets, and later between\r\nNinth and Tenth; and the other by Augustus and Thomas Perry on the\r\ncorner of Ninth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Charles Demonet, the\r\nconfectioner, made his appearance a little later on Pennsylvania Avenue,\r\nbetween Seventeenth and Eighteenth Streets; but Charles Gautier, on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, between Twelfth and Thirteenth Streets, was his\r\nsuccessful rival and was regarded more favorably in aristocratic\r\ncircles. Madame Marguerite M. Delarue kept a shop on the north side of\r\nthe same avenue, also between Twelfth and Thirteenth Streets, where\r\nsmall articles of dress dear to the feminine heart could be bought.\r\nThere were several large grocery stores on the south side of\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, between Sixth and Seventh Streets. Benjamin L.\r\nJackson and Brother were the proprietors of one and James L. Barbour and\r\nJohn A. Hamilton of another, although the two latter had their business\r\nhouse at an earlier day on Louisiana Avenue. Louis Vavans was the\r\naccomplished cook and caterer, and sent to their rooms the meals of\r\nmany persons temporarily residing in Washington. Joseph Redfern, his\r\nson-in-law, kept a grocery store in the First Ward. Franck Taylor, the\r\nfather of the late Rear Admiral Henry C. Taylor, U.S.N., was the\r\nproprietor of a book store on Pennsylvania Avenue, near Four-and-a-Half\r\nStreet, where many of the scholarly men of the day congregated to\r\ndiscuss literary and current topics. His store had a bust of Sir Walter\r\nScott over its door, and he usually kept his front show-windows closed\r\nto prevent the light from fading the bindings of his books. The Center\r\nMarket was located upon the same site as at present, but of course it\r\nhas since been greatly enlarged and improved. All the stores on\r\nLouisiana Avenue sold at retail. I remember the grocery store of J.\r\nHarrison Semmes on Ninth Street and Louisiana Avenue, opposite the\r\nCenter Market; and the hardware store kept by Joseph Savage on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, between Sixth and Seventh Streets, and at another\r\ntime between Third and Fourth Streets.\r\n\r\nOn Fifteenth Street opposite the Treasury was another well-known\r\nboarding house, conducted by Mrs. Ulrich and much patronized by members\r\nof the Diplomatic Corps. Willard's Hotel was just around the corner on\r\nthe site of the New Willard, and its proprietor was Caleb Willard.\r\nBrown's Hotel, farther down town, on Pennsylvania Avenue and Sixth\r\nStreet, was a popular rendezvous for Congressional people. It was first\r\ncalled the Indian Queen, and was kept by that prince of hosts, Jesse\r\nBrown. After his death the name was changed to the Metropolitan.\r\n\r\nThe National Hotel on the opposite corner was the largest hostelry in\r\nWashington. It boasted of a large Southern _cliéntèle_, and until\r\nPresident Buchanan's administration enjoyed a very prosperous career.\r\nSubsequent to Buchanan's inauguration, however, a mysterious epidemic\r\nappeared among the guests of the house which the physicians of the\r\nDistrict failed to satisfactorily diagnose. It became commonly known as\r\nthe \"National Hotel disease,\" and resulted in numerous deaths. A notice\r\noccasionally appeared in the current newspapers stating that the\r\ndeceased had died from this malady. Mrs. Robert Greenhow, in her book\r\npublished in London during the Civil War, entitled \"My Imprisonment and\r\nthe First Years of Abolition Rule at Washington,\" attributes the\r\nepidemic to the machinations of the Republicans, who were desirous of\r\ndisposing of President Buchanan. John Gadsby was its proprietor at one\r\ntime, from whom it usually went by the name of \"Gadsby's.\" President\r\nBuchanan was one of its guests on the eve of his inauguration.\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew Washington, slavery was in full sway and, with but few\r\nexceptions, all servants were colored. The wages of a good cook were\r\nonly six or seven dollars a month, but their proficiency in the culinary\r\nart was remarkable. I remember once hearing Count Adam Gurowski, who had\r\ntraversed the European continent, remark that he had never anywhere\r\ntasted such cooking as in the South. The grace of manner of many of the\r\nelderly male slaves of that day would, indeed, have adorned a court.\r\nWhen William L. Marcy, who, although a master in statesmanship and\r\ndiplomacy, was not especially gifted in external graces, was taking\r\nfinal leave of the clerks in the War Department, where as Secretary he\r\nhad rendered such distinguished services under President Polk, he shook\r\nhands with an elderly colored employee named Datcher, who had formerly\r\nbeen a body servant to President Monroe, and said: \"Good-bye, Datcher;\r\nif I had had your manners I should have left more friends behind me.\"\r\nSome years later, and after my marriage into the Gouverneur family, I\r\nhad the good fortune to have passed down to me a venerable colored man\r\nwho had served my husband's family for many years and whose name was\r\n\"Uncle James.\" His manner at times was quite overpowering. On entering\r\nmy drawing-room on one occasion to greet George Newell, brother-in-law\r\nand guest of ex-Governor Marcy, I found him seated upon a sofa and\r\napparently engaged in a \"brown study.\" Referring at once to \"Uncle\r\nJames,\" he inquired: \"Who is that man?\" Upon my replying, \"An old family\r\nservant,\" he remarked: \"Well, he is the most polite man I have ever\r\nmet.\"\r\n\r\nSome years later my sister, Mrs. Eames, moved into a house on the corner\r\nof H and Fourteenth Streets, which she and her husband had built and\r\nwhich she occupied until her death in 1890. I naturally shrink from\r\ndwelling in detail upon her charm of manner and social career, and\r\nprefer rather to quote an extract from a sketch which appeared in one of\r\nthe newspapers just after her death:\r\n\r\n     ... During the twenty-eight years of her married life in\r\n     Washington Mrs. Eames's house was one of the favorite\r\n     resorts of the most conspicuous and interesting men of the\r\n     nation; it was a species of neutral ground where men of all\r\n     parties and shades of political opinion found it agreeable\r\n     to foregather. Though at first in moderate circumstances and\r\n     living in a house which rented for less than $300 a year,\r\n     there was no house in Washington except, perhaps, the\r\n     President's, where one was sure of meeting any evening\r\n     throughout the year so many people of distinction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. CHARLES EAMES, NEÉ CAMPBELL, BY GAMBADELLA.\r\n\r\n_Owned by Mrs. Gordon-Cumming._]\r\n\r\n     Mr. and Mrs. Marcy were devoted to Mrs. Eames; her _salon_\r\n     was almost the daily resort of Edward Everett, Rufus Choate,\r\n     Charles Sumner, Secretary [James] Guthrie, Governor [John\r\n     A.] Andrews of Massachusetts, Winter Davis, Caleb Cushing,\r\n     Senator Preston King, N.P. Banks, and representative men of\r\n     that ilk. Mr. [Samuel J.] Tilden when in Washington was\r\n     often their guest. The gentlemen, who were all on the most\r\n     familiar terms with the family, were in the habit of\r\n     bringing their less conspicuous friends from time to time,\r\n     thus making it quite the most attractive _salon_ that has\r\n     been seen in Washington since the death of Mrs. Madison, and\r\n     made such without any of the attractions of wealth or\r\n     luxury.\r\n\r\n     The relations thus established with the public men of the\r\n     country at her fireside were strengthened and enriched by a\r\n     voluminous correspondence. Her father, who was a very\r\n     accomplished man, had one of the largest and choicest\r\n     private libraries in New York, of which, from the time she\r\n     could read, Mrs. Eames had the freedom; in this library she\r\n     spent more time than anyone else, and more than anywhere\r\n     else, until her marriage. As a consequence, it is no\r\n     disparagement to any one else to say that during her\r\n     residence there she was intellectually quite the most\r\n     accomplished woman in Washington. Her epistolary talent was\r\n     famous in her generation.\r\n\r\n     Her correspondence if collected and published would prove to\r\n     have been not less voluminous than Mme. de Sevigné's and, in\r\n     point of literary art, in no particular inferior to that of\r\n     the famous French woman.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four months spent in Washington, I returned to my home in\r\nNew York; and several years later, in the spring of 1848, suffered one\r\nof the severest ordeals of my life. I refer to my father's death. No\r\nhuman being ever entered eternity more beloved or esteemed than he, and\r\nas I look back to my life with him I realize that I was possibly more\r\nblessed than I deserved to be permitted to live with such a well-nigh\r\nperfect character and to know him familiarly. From my earliest childhood\r\nI was accustomed to see the sorrowing and oppressed come to him for\r\nadvice. He was especially qualified to perform such a function owing to\r\nhis long tenure of the office of Surrogate. Widows and orphans who could\r\nnot afford litigation always found in him a faithful friend. With a\r\ncapacity of feeling for the wrongs of others as keenly as though\r\ninflicted upon himself, his sympathy invariably assumed a practical form\r\nand he accordingly left behind him hosts of sorrowing and grateful\r\nhearts. A short time before his death I visited a dying widow, a devoted\r\nRoman Catholic, whom from time to time my father had assisted. When I\r\nwas about to leave, she said: \"Say to your father I hope to meet him\r\namong the just made perfect.\" This remark of a poor woman has been to me\r\nthrough all these years a greater consolation than any public tribute or\r\nimposing eulogy. Finely chiseled monuments and fulsome epitaphs are not\r\nto be compared with the benediction of grateful hearts.\r\n\r\nThe funeral services were conducted, according to the custom of sixty\r\nyears ago, by the Rev. Dr. William Adams and the Rev. Dr. Philip\r\nMilledoler. Members of the bar and many prominent residents of New York,\r\nincluding his two physicians, Doctors John W. Francis and Campbell F.\r\nStewart, walked behind the coffin, which, by the way, was not placed in\r\na hearse but was carried to the Second Street Cemetery, where his\r\nremains were temporarily placed. There were six clergymen present at his\r\nfuneral--the Rev. Doctors Thomas De Witt, Thomas E. Vermilye, Philip\r\nMilledoler, William Adams, John Knox and George H. Fisher, all ministers\r\nof the Reformed Dutch Church except the Rev. Dr. Adams, the\r\ndistinguished Presbyterian divine.\r\n\r\nI find myself almost instinctively returning to the Scott family as\r\nassociated with the most cherished memories of some of the happiest days\r\nof my life. During my childhood I formed a close intimacy with Cornelia\r\nScott, the second daughter of the distinguished General, which continued\r\nuntil the close of her life. When I first knew the family it made its\r\nwinter home in New York at the American Hotel, then a fashionable\r\nhostelry kept by William B. Cozzens, on the corner of Barclay Street and\r\nBroadway. In the summer the family resided at Hampton, the old Mayo\r\nplace near Elizabeth in New Jersey, where they kept open house. Colonel\r\nJohn Mayo of Richmond, whose daughter Maria was the wife of General\r\nScott, had purchased this country seat many years before as a favor to\r\nhis wife, Miss Abigail De Hart of New Jersey, and Mrs. Scott\r\nsubsequently inherited it. Colonel John Mayo, who was a citizen of\r\nlarge wealth and great prominence, was so public-spirited that not long\r\nsubsequent to the Revolutionary War, and entirely at his own expense, he\r\nbuilt from his own plans a bridge across the James River at Richmond. I\r\nhave heard Mrs. Scott graphically describe her father's trips from\r\nRichmond to Elizabeth in his coach-of-four with outriders and grooms,\r\nand his enthusiastic reception when he reached his destination.\r\n\r\nI have frequently heard it said that Mrs. Scott as a young woman refused\r\nthe early offers of marriage from the man who eventually became her\r\nhusband because his rank in the army was too low to suit her taste, but\r\nthat she finally relented when he became a General. I am able to\r\ncontradict this statement as Mrs. Scott told me with her own lips that\r\nshe never made his acquaintance until he was a General, in spite of the\r\nfact that they were both natives of the same State. This did not by any\r\nmeans, however, indicate a marriage late in life, as General Scott\r\nbecame a Brigadier General on the 9th of March, 1814, when he was\r\nbetween twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age. In the _Sentinel_,\r\npublished in Newark, New Jersey, on the 25th of March, 1817, the\r\nfollowing marriage notice appears:\r\n\r\n     Married--at Belleville, Virginia, at the seat of Col. Mayo,\r\n     General Winfield Scott of the U.S. Army to Miss Maria D.\r\n     Mayo.\r\n\r\nMrs. Scott's record as a belle was truly remarkable, and in the latter\r\nyears of her life when I knew her very intimately she still retained\r\ntraces of great beauty. Her accomplishments, too, were extraordinary for\r\nthat period. She was not only a skilled performer upon the piano and\r\nharp, but also a linguist of considerable proficiency, while her grace\r\nof manner and brilliant powers of repartee added greatly to her social\r\ncharms. On one occasion during Polk's administration she attended a\r\nlevee at the White House, and as she passed down the line with the other\r\nguests she received an enthusiastic welcome and was soon so completely\r\nsurrounded by an admiring throng that for a while Mrs. Polk was left\r\nvery much to herself. It was Mrs. Scott who wrote in the album of a\r\nfriend the verse entitled, \"The Two Faults of Men.\" Two other verses\r\nwere written under it several years later by the Hon. William C.\r\nSomerville of Maryland, at one time our Minister to Sweden, and the\r\nauthor of \"Letters from Paris on the Causes and Consequences of the\r\nFrench Revolution.\"\r\n\r\n    Women have many faults,\r\n      The men have only two;\r\n    There's nothing right they say,\r\n      And nothing right they do.\r\n\r\n    _Reply_\r\n\r\n    That men are naughty rogues we know,\r\n      The girls are roguish, too.\r\n    They watch each other wondrous well\r\n      In everything they do.\r\n\r\n    But if we men do nothing right,\r\n      And never say what's true,\r\n    What precious fools you women are\r\n      To love us as you do.\r\n\r\nMany years ago General and Mrs. Scott traveled with their youthful\r\nfamily through Europe, and while at the French Capital Mrs. Scott\r\nattended a fancy-dress ball where she represented Pocahontas and was\r\ncalled _La belle sauvage_. I have talked to two elderly officers of our\r\nArmy, Colonel John M. Fessenden and General John B. Magruder, the latter\r\nsubsequently of Confederate fame, and both of them told me that at this\r\nentertainment she was an object of general admiration. Many years later,\r\nlong after Mrs. Scott's death, I was visiting her daughter, Mrs. Henry\r\nL. Scott, for the last time at the old Elizabeth home, accompanied by my\r\nyoung daughter Maud, when the latter was invited to a fancy-dress ball\r\ngiven to children at the residence of General George Herbert Pegram. At\r\nfirst I was at my wits' end to devise a suitable gown for her to wear,\r\nwhen Mrs. Scott brought out the historic fancy dress worn by her mother\r\nso many years before in Paris and gave it to me. It seems almost\r\nneedless to add that the child wore the dress, and that I have it now\r\ncarefully put away among my treasured possessions. Many years subsequent\r\nto Mrs. Scott's visit to Paris, her sister, Mrs. Robert Henry Cabell of\r\nRichmond, published for the benefit of a charity her letters written\r\nfrom abroad to her family in Virginia, containing many interesting\r\nrecollections of Paris.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Mexican War the Scotts were living in New York\r\nbut, for a reason I do not now recall, Mrs. Scott decided to spend a\r\nwinter during the General's absence in Philadelphia. She secured a\r\nportion of a furnished house at 111 South Sixth Street, and in the\r\nspring of 1847 I was invited to be her guest. The evening of the day of\r\nmy arrival I attended a party at the residence of Judge John Meredith\r\nRead, a descendant of George Read, a Signer from Delaware. Upon the\r\nurgent request of Mrs. Scott I went to this entertainment entirely\r\nalone, as she and her daughter Cornelia were indisposed and she wished\r\nher household to be represented. Judge Read was a widower and some years\r\nlater I renewed my acquaintance with him in Washington. During my visit\r\nin Philadelphia, Mrs. Scott was suddenly called away and hesitated about\r\nleaving us two young girls in the house alone, her younger daughters\r\nbeing absent at school. Finally, she made arrangements for us to spend\r\nthe days of her absence in Burlington, New Jersey, with Miss Susan\r\nWallace, a friend of hers and a niece of the Hon. William Bradford,\r\nAttorney-General during a portion of Washington's last administration.\r\nThis, however, was not altogether a satisfactory arrangement for us\r\nyoung people and we became decidedly restless, but to Burlington we went\r\njust the same. Meanwhile, news came from Mexico of a great American\r\nvictory and the public went wild with enthusiasm. Philadelphia made\r\nplans to celebrate the glad event on a certain evening, and Cornelia\r\nScott and I decided to return to Philadelphia for the festivities. We\r\ncarefully planned the trip and took as our protector a faithful colored\r\nman named Lee. Arabella Griffith, an adopted daughter of Miss Wallace,\r\nalso accompanied us, and as another companion we took Mrs. Scott's pet\r\ndog _Gee_ whom, before the evening was over, we found to be very\r\ntroublesome. We made the trip to Philadelphia by water and landed in an\r\nout-of-the-way portion of the city. Owing to the dense crowds assembled\r\nto view the decorations, illuminations and fireworks, we were unable to\r\nprocure a carriage and consequently were obliged to walk, while, to cap\r\nthe climax, in pushing through the crowd we lost Miss Griffith. General\r\nScott's name was upon the lips of everyone, and his pictures were seen\r\nhanging from many windows; yet the daughter of the hero who was the\r\ncause of all the enthusiasm was a simple wayfarer, rubbing elbows with\r\nthe multitude, unrecognized and entirely ignored. I may state, by the\r\nway, that Arabella Griffith subsequently became the wife of General\r\nFrancis C. Barlow and that, while her husband was fighting the battles\r\nof his country during the Civil War, she did noble service in the Union\r\nhospitals as a member of the United States Sanitary Commission, and died\r\nin the summer of 1864 from a fever contracted in the hospitals of the\r\nArmy of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nI remained in Philadelphia much longer than I had originally\r\nanticipated, and unexpected warm weather found me totally unprepared. I\r\nimmediately wrote to my sister Margaret and asked her to send me some\r\nsuitable apparel. Her letter in reply to mine, which I insert, gives\r\nsomething of an idea of New York society of that period. As she was\r\nquite a young girl her references to Miss Julia Gerard whom she knew\r\nquite well and \"Old Leslie Irving,\" who, by the way, was only a young\r\nman, must be regarded merely as the silly utterances of extreme youth:--\r\n\r\n     Dear Sister,\r\n\r\n     I received your letter and as it requires an immediate\r\n     answer, I shall commence writing you one. I believe in my\r\n     last I mentioned to you that I was going to Virginia Wood's\r\n     [Mrs. John L. Rogers] the following evening. I went with\r\n     [William B.] Clerke [a young broker] and had quite a\r\n     pleasant time. There were two young ladies there from\r\n     Virginia whose names I do not know, Dr. Augustine Smith's\r\n     daughter, myself, Mr. Galliher, Mr. Rainsford, Mr. Bannister\r\n     and Mr. Pendleton [John Pendleton of Fredericksburg,\r\n     Virginia]. I was introduced to the latter and liked him\r\n     quite well. I had a long talk with him. His manners are\r\n     entirely too coquettish to suit me; he does nothing but\r\n     shrug his shoulders and roll up his eyes--perhaps it is a\r\n     Virginia custom. He seems to think Miss Gerard [Julia,\r\n     daughter of James W. Gerard] his _belle_ ideal or _beau_\r\n     ideal of everything lovely, etc. I told him that I thought\r\n     her awful, that she had such an inanimate sickly expression,\r\n     and I abused her at a great rate! I expect he thinks I am a\r\n     regular devil!\r\n\r\n     Tonight I am going to the opera. \"Lucretia Borgia\" is to be\r\n     performed. I have learned a song from Lucia. So you can\r\n     imagine how much the rooster has improved!\r\n\r\n     On Thursday evening I was at the Moore's [Dr. William\r\n     Moore]. Frank Bucknor came for me and brought me home. His\r\n     sister [Cornelia Bucknor, subsequently the wife of Professor\r\n     John Howard Van Amringe of Columbia College] was there, Beek\r\n     Fish [Beekman Fish], Bayard Fish, Dr. [Adolphus] Follin, old\r\n     Leslie Irving and Frank Van Rensselaer. Miss Moore told me\r\n     that May came for us that evening to go to the Academy. I am\r\n     dreadfully sorry that you will not be able to go to the\r\n     Kemble [Mrs. William Kemble] ball; they are going to have\r\n     it on Monday. I dare say it will be very pleasant and old\r\n     Chrystie will be there. Emily B. [Emily Bucknor] and Frank\r\n     [Bucknor] are going.\r\n\r\n     My hat has come home, and it is very pretty; it is a sherred\r\n     blue crape, without any ribbon--trimmed very simply with\r\n     blue crape and illusion mixed and the same inside.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. William Le Roy has been to see you. Ma thinks that you\r\n     had better come home when you first expected--on Tuesday or\r\n     Wednesday. I am very much disappointed that you are not here\r\n     to go to the Kembles as you have a dress to wear.\r\n\r\n     You can tell Adeline [Adeline Camilla Scott], if you please,\r\n     that Mr. Pendleton wants to know the use of sending her to\r\n     school when her head is filled with beaux and parties. I\r\n     told him her mother did it to keep her out of mischief.\r\n     Bucknor says he thinks it is time for you to come home. If\r\n     you stay much longer my spring fever will come on and I\r\n     shall get so many things there will be no money left for\r\n     you. Besides Mr. Pendleton is going to the Bucknor's some\r\n     day next week and I am going to get him to stop for me, and\r\n     if you are home I shall invite you to go along. Beek Fish\r\n     will be there the same evening with his flute. He told Emily\r\n     B. that his sister [Mrs. Thomas Pym Remington of\r\n     Philadelphia] had written them that you had been in\r\n     Philadelphia and that she was so delighted to see you.\r\n\r\n     Leslie Irving told me that he had seen a letter in the\r\n     Commercial Advertiser from Thomas Turner [subsequently Rear\r\n     Admiral Turner, U.S.N.] to Hamilton Fish. He thought of\r\n     sending it to you, but he thought some one else had probably\r\n     done so. I hear that they [the Fishes] are to have a party.\r\n     The Bankheads [General James Bankhead's daughters] are going\r\n     to spend the summer at West Point. Pa and Jim are better. Pa\r\n     rode out yesterday and walked out to-day. He has been in a\r\n     great state of excitement about General Scott. It was\r\n     reported two days ago that he was killed and he was afraid\r\n     it was true. Vera Cruz, I believe, is taken. I cannot write\r\n     any longer, I'm so tired. I will send Cornelia's [Cornelia\r\n     Scott] purse by H. Forbes [Harriet Forbes, Mrs. Colhoun of\r\n     Philadelphia].\r\n\r\n          M. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n     Saturday April 10th.\r\n\r\n     Pa thinks it is time for you to come home. Do you know of\r\n     any opportunity? I shall not send anything to you. You see\r\n     you never will take my advice in anything. I told you to\r\n     bring your pink dress with you but you would not. I suppose\r\n     I shall not hear from you again. Pa says you can do as you\r\n     please about staying longer.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, New Jersey, was a quaint old town whose inhabitants seemed\r\nalmost exclusively made up of Barbers, Ogdens and Chetwoods, with a\r\nsprinkling of De Harts. There was a steamboat plying between\r\nElizabethport (now a part of the City of Elizabeth) and New York, and we\r\nwere its frequent patrons. Ursino, the country seat of the Kean family,\r\nthen as now was one of the historic places of the neighborhood. As I\r\nremember the beautiful old home, it was occupied by John Kean, father of\r\nthe late senior U.S. Senator from New Jersey. At an earlier period the\r\nlatter's great-grandfather had married Susan Livingston, a daughter of\r\nPeter Van Brough Livingston of New York, and resided at Ursino. After\r\nthe death of her husband she married Count Julian Niemcewicz, who was\r\ncalled the \"Shakespeare of Poland\" and who came to America with\r\nKosciusco, upon whose staff he had served. She was also the grandmother\r\nof Mrs. Hamilton Fish. Another noted estate in the same general\r\nneighborhood, was \"Abyssinia,\" owned and occupied for a long period by\r\nthe Ricketts family, whose walls were highly decorated by one of its\r\nartistic members. I am informed that it still stands but that it is\r\nused, alas, for mechanical purposes!\r\n\r\nI recall with intense pleasure another of my visits to New Jersey when I\r\nwas a guest at the home of General and Mrs. Scott in Elizabeth. Isabella\r\nCass of Detroit, daughter of General Lewis Cass, was also there at the\r\nsame time. She attended school in Paris while her father was Minister to\r\nFrance and received other educational advantages quite unusual for women\r\nat that time. While residing in Washington at a subsequent period she\r\nwas regarded as one of the reigning belles. She married a member of the\r\nDiplomatic Corps from the Netherlands and lived and died abroad. A\r\nconstant visitor of the Scott family whom I recall with great pleasure\r\nwas Thomas Turner, subsequently an Admiral in our Navy. He was a\r\nVirginian by birth and a near relative of General Robert E. Lee; but,\r\nthough possessing the blood of the Carters, he remained during the Civil\r\nWar loyal to the national flag. His wife was Frances Hailes Palmer of\r\n\"Abyssinia.\"\r\n\r\nStill another guest of the Scotts in Elizabeth was the erratic but\r\ndecidedly brilliant Doctor William Starbuck Mayo. Although Mrs. Scott\r\nwas a Mayo, they were not related. He was from the northern part of the\r\nState of New York, while Mrs. Scott, as is well known, was from\r\nVirginia. Doctor Mayo, however, was an ardent admirer of Mrs. Scott and\r\nmade the fact apparent in much that he said and did. He was the author\r\nof several works, one of which was a romance entitled \"Kaloolah,\" which\r\nhe dedicated to Mrs. Scott. When I met him in Washington he was on his\r\nfirst bridal tour, although pretty well advanced in years. His bride was\r\nMrs. Henry Dudley of New York, whose maiden name was Helen Stuyvesant.\r\nShe was the daughter of Nicholas William Stuyvesant and one of the heirs\r\nof the large estate of Peter G. Stuyvesant. During Van Buren's\r\nadministration, Doctor Mayo was a social light in Washington.\r\n\r\nThere was another Dr. Mayo--Robert Mayo of Richmond--who, in some\r\nrespects, created a temporary commotion in public life in Washington and\r\nelsewhere. He was a Virginian by birth, and at one time figured\r\nprominently as a politician. He engaged in the presidential campaign of\r\n1828 as an ardent partisan of General Jackson and during that period\r\nedited in Richmond the _Jackson Democrat_. He subsequently, however,\r\nparted company with his presidential idol, and in 1839 published a\r\nvolume entitled, \"Political Sketches of Eight Years in Washington,\"\r\nwhich is almost exclusively devoted to an arraignment of General\r\nJackson's administration. In an original letter now before me, written\r\nby Martin Van Buren to Governor William C. Bouck, of New York, which has\r\nnever before appeared in print, he speaks in an amusing manner of Dr.\r\nMayo. I insert the whole letter, as his allusions to General Jackson are\r\nof exceptional interest. No one can well deny that the parting\r\nadmonition of Polonius to his son Laertes is a masterpiece of human\r\nwisdom, but this letter of the \"Sage of Lindenwald\" to Governor Bouck\r\nreveals ability by no means inferior to that of this wise councilor of\r\nDenmark.\r\n\r\n     [EX-PRESIDENT VAN BUREN TO GOV. WILLIAM C. BOUCK OF N.Y.]\r\n\r\n     Confidential.\r\n\r\n     Lindenwald,\r\n     Jan^y. 17th 1843.\r\n\r\n     My dear Sir,\r\n\r\n     I embrace the occasion of a short visit of my son Major Van\r\n     Buren to Albany before he goes South to drop you a few\r\n     lines. Although I have not admitted it in my conversations\r\n     with those who are given to croaking, and thus alarm our\r\n     friends, I have nevertheless witnessed with the keenest\r\n     regret the distractions among our friends at Albany; & more\r\n     particularly in relation to the state printing. It is\r\n     certainly a lamentable winding up of a great contest\r\n     admirably conducted &, as we supposed, gloriously\r\n     terminated. Without undertaking to decide who is right or\r\n     who is wrong, and much less to take any part in the\r\n     unfortunate controversy, I cannot but experience great pain\r\n     from the eying of so bitter a controversy in the face of the\r\n     enemy among those who once acted together so honorably & so\r\n     usefully, and for all of whom I have so much reason to\r\n     cherish feelings of respect & regard. Permit me to make one\r\n     suggestion, & that relates to the importance of a speedy\r\n     decision, one way or the other. Nothing is so injurious in\r\n     such cases as delay. It is almost better to decide wrong\r\n     than to protract the contest. Every day makes new enemies &\r\n     increases the animosities of those who have already become\r\n     so, & extends them to other subjects; and yet nothing is so\r\n     natural as to desire to put off the decision of\r\n     controversies among friends. Most happy would I be to find\r\n     that you had been able to mitigate, if not altogether to\r\n     obviate, existing difficulties by providing places for one\r\n     or more of the competitors in other branches of the public\r\n     service to which they are adapted & with which they would be\r\n     as well satisfied.\r\n\r\n     It has afforded me unfeigned satisfaction to learn, as I do\r\n     from all quarters, that you keep your own secrets in regard\r\n     to appointments, & don't feed every body with promises or\r\n     what they construe into promises--a practice which so many\r\n     public men are apt to fall into, & by which they make\r\n     themselves more trouble & subject themselves to more\r\n     discredit than they dream of. Persevere in that course,\r\n     consider carefully every case & make the selection which\r\n     your own unbiassed judgment designates as the best, & above\r\n     all let the people see as clear as day that you do not yield\r\n     yourself to, or make battle against, any cliques or sections\r\n     of the party, but act in good faith and to the best of your\r\n     ability for the good of the whole, and you may be assured\r\n     that the personal discontents which you would to some extent\r\n     occasion, if you had the wisdom of Solomon & were pure as an\r\n     angel, will do you no harm & be exceedingly evanescent in\r\n     their duration. The Democratic is a reasonable & a just\r\n     party & more than half of the business is done when they are\r\n     satisfied that the man they have elected means to do right.\r\n     The difficulty with a new administration is in the\r\n     beginning. At the start little matters may create a distrust\r\n     which it will take a series of good acts to remove. But once\r\n     a favourable impression is made & the people become\r\n     satisfied that the right thing is intended, it takes great\r\n     errors, often repeated, to create a counter current. Will\r\n     you excuse me if, from a sincere desire for your success, I\r\n     go farther & touch upon matters not political, or at least\r\n     not wholly so? Your situation of course excites envy &\r\n     jealousy on the part of some. It is impossible from the\r\n     character of man that it should be otherwise, bear yourself\r\n     ever so meekly & you cannot avoid it. There will therefore\r\n     in Albany, as well as elsewhere, be people who will make ill\r\n     natured remarks & there will be still more who will make it\r\n     their business, in the hope of benefitting themselves, to\r\n     bring you exaggerated accounts of what is said, and if they\r\n     lack materials they will tell you, if they find that you\r\n     like to listen to small things, a great deal that never has\r\n     been said. It is my deliberate opinion that these\r\n     mischievous gossips cause public men more vexation, yes, ten\r\n     fold, than all the cares & anxieties of office taken\r\n     together. I have seen perhaps as much of this as any man of\r\n     my age, & claim to be a competent judge of the evil & its\r\n     remedies. The greatest fault I ever saw in our excellent\r\n     friend Gen^l. Jackson, was the facility with which (in\r\n     carrying out his general principle that it was the duty of\r\n     the President to hear all) he leant his ear, though not his\r\n     confidence, to such people. Though very sagacious & very apt\r\n     to put the right construction upon all such revelations, it\r\n     was still evident that he was every day more or less annoyed\r\n     by them. I endeavored to satisfy him of the expediency of\r\n     shutting their mouths, but did not succeed, & I am as sure\r\n     as I can be of any such thing that if the truth could be\r\n     known it would appear that he had experienced more annoyance\r\n     from such sources than from all the severe trials through\r\n     which he had to pass & did pass with such unfading glory.\r\n     Having his case before me, I determined to profit by the\r\n     experience I had acquired in so good a school. I had no\r\n     sooner taken possession of the White House than I was beset\r\n     by these harpies. The way in which I treated the whole crew,\r\n     with variations of course according to circumstances, will\r\n     appear from the following dialogue in a single case. The\r\n     celebrated Dr. Mayo called upon me & in his stuttering &\r\n     mysterious way commenced by asking when he could have a few\r\n     minutes very private conversation with me. Knowing the man,\r\n     I anticipated his business & told him now, I will hear you\r\n     now. He then told me he had discovered a conspiracy to\r\n     destroy me politically the particulars of which he felt it\r\n     to be his duty to lay before [me]. I replied instantly, &\r\n     somewhat sternly, Dr., I do not wish to hear them. I have\r\n     irrefragable proof, he replied. I don't care, was the\r\n     response. It is in writing, Sir, said he. I won't look at\r\n     it, Sir. What, said he, don't you want to see it if it is in\r\n     writing & genuine? An emphatic No, Sir, closed the\r\n     conversation. The Dr. raised his eyes and hands as if he\r\n     thought me demented, & making a low bow & ejaculating a long\r\n     Hah-hah retreated for the door. The story about the Dr. got\r\n     out and, partly by mine & I believe in part also by his\r\n     means, & alarmed all the story tellers who heard of it. A\r\n     few repetitions of the same dose to others impressed the\r\n     whole crew with a conviction that nothing was to be gained\r\n     by bringing such reports to me. The consequence was that\r\n     although Washington is perhaps the most gossiping place in\r\n     the world, I escaped its contamination altogether, and had\r\n     no trouble except such as unavoidably grew out of my public\r\n     duties; and although I had perhaps a more vexatious time\r\n     than any of my predecessors in that respect I was the only\r\n     man, they all say, who grew fat in that office.\r\n\r\n     I was happy to learn from my son John by a letter received\r\n     yesterday the high opinion he entertains of your discreet &\r\n     honorable bearing in the midst of the difficulties by which\r\n     you are beset. I hope he & Smith, [another son of Martin Van\r\n     Buren], exercise the discretion by which their course has\r\n     heretofore been governed, in meddling as little with things\r\n     political that do not belong to them as possible. They know\r\n     that such is my wish, as any contest there must necessarily\r\n     be more or less between my friends; and I shall be obliged\r\n     to you to give them from time to time such advice upon the\r\n     subject as you may think proper. Be assured that they will\r\n     take it in good part. You may, if you please, at your\r\n     convenience, return me the suggestions I sent you, as I may\r\n     have occasion to weave some parts of them into letters that\r\n     I am frequently obliged to write; the rough draft was made\r\n     with a pencil & is now illegible. Be assured that your not\r\n     using them occasioned me no mortification, as I before told\r\n     you it would not. You had a nearer & could take a safer view\r\n     of things than myself. Don't trouble yourself to answer this\r\n     letter as it requires none; only excuse me for writing you\r\n     one so unmercifully long.\r\n\r\n     Remember me kindly to Mrs. Bouck, & believe me to be\r\n\r\n          Very sincerely your friend,\r\n\r\n               M. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n     His Excellency,\r\n     Wm. C. Bouck.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 General and Mrs. Scott moved to Washington and Hampton was\r\nclosed for many years. They lived in one of the houses built by Count De\r\nMenou, French Minister to this country from 1822 to 1824, on H Street,\r\nbetween Thirteenth and Fourteenth Streets, on the present site of the\r\nEpiphany Parish House. These residences were commonly called the \"chain\r\nbuildings,\" owing to the fact that their fences were made almost\r\nentirely of iron chains. Two of them, thrown into one, were occupied by\r\nthe Scotts and were owned by my father-in-law, Samuel L. Gouverneur,\r\nsenior. In the third, the property of Mrs. Beverly Kennon, lived the\r\nvenerable Mrs. Alexander Hamilton and her only daughter, Mrs. Hamilton\r\nHolly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSOCIAL LEADERS IN WASHINGTON LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nI passed many delightful hours in the Washington home of General Scott\r\nand had a standing invitation to come and go as I pleased. Upon his\r\nreturn from the war with Mexico, crowned with the laurels of victory, he\r\nimmediately became one of the most prominent lions of the day. He had\r\nsuccessfully invaded a practically unknown country reeking with the\r\nterrible _vomito_, a disease upon which the Mexicans relied to kill\r\ntheir foes more expeditiously than ammunition, and had well earned for\r\nhimself the plaudits of a grateful country. I distinctly remember that\r\nhe received flattering letters from the Duke of Wellington and other\r\ndistinguished foreigners congratulating him upon his military success.\r\nHis headquarters were now established in Washington, and his house\r\nbecame one of the most prominent social centers of the National Capital.\r\nAbout this time Mrs. Scott was much in New York, where her third\r\ndaughter, Marcella, subsequently Mrs. Charles Carroll McTavish, was\r\nattending school, and consequently her daughter Cornelia, who not long\r\nbefore had married her father's aide, Henry Lee Scott of North Carolina,\r\nwas virtually mistress of the establishment. Mrs. Henry Lee Scott's\r\nsocial sway in Washington was almost unprecedented. She was as grand in\r\nappearance as she was in character, and during one of her visits to Rome\r\nshe sat for a distinguished artist as a model for his pictures of the\r\nMadonna. General Scott seemed to derive much pleasure and satisfaction\r\nfrom the society of his former companions in arms, who were always\r\nwelcomed to his hospitable board. Among those I especially recall were\r\nColonels John Abert, Roger Jones, William Turnbull and Ichabod B. Crane,\r\nwhose son, Dr. Charles H. Crane, later became Surgeon General of the\r\nArmy. These occasions were especially delightful to me as a young woman,\r\nand I always regarded it as an exceptional privilege to be present.\r\n\r\nThe Whig party meanwhile nominated General Scott for the presidency. The\r\nopposing candidate was Franklin Pierce. One day during the campaign\r\nScott, in replying to a note addressed to him by William L. Marcy,\r\nSecretary of War in Polk's cabinet, began his note: \"After a hasty plate\r\nof soup\"--supposing that his note would be regarded as personal. Marcy,\r\nwho was a keen political foe, was too astute a politician, however, not\r\nto take advantage of the chance to make Scott appear ridiculous. He\r\nclassified the note as official, and the whole country soon resounded\r\nwith it. I saw General Scott when he returned from his Mexican campaign,\r\ncovered with glory, to confront his political enemies at home, and I was\r\nalso with him in 1852 when the announcement arrived that he had been\r\ndefeated as a presidential candidate. Were I called upon to decide in\r\nwhich character he appeared to the greater advantage, that of the victor\r\nor the vanquished, I should unhesitatingly give my verdict to the\r\nlatter. There was a grandeur in his bearing under the adverse\r\ncircumstances with which the success and glamour of arms could not\r\ncompare.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Smith Pyne, the beloved rector of St. John's Episcopal\r\nChurch, often mingled with the distinguished guests gathered at the\r\nresidence of General Scott. He was full of life and fun and good cheer\r\nand would even dare, when occasion offered, to aim his jokes and puns at\r\nGeneral Scott himself. At one of the General's dinners, for example,\r\nwhile the soup was being served, he addressed him as \"Marshal\r\n_Turenne_.\" It is said that upon one occasion, when the good rector\r\nfailed by polite efforts to dismiss a book-agent, he was regretfully\r\ncompelled to order him from his house. \"Your cloth protects you,\" said\r\nthe offended agent. \"The cloth protects _you_,\" replied Dr. Pyne, \"and\r\nit will not protect you long if you do not leave this instant.\" In spite\r\nof this incident, it was well known that the Doctor had a tender and\r\nsympathetic nature. After he had officiated at the funerals of his\r\nparishioners it is said that his wife was frequently compelled to exert\r\nall her efforts to arouse him from his depression. About this same\r\nperiod, Ole Bull, the great Norwegian violinist who was second only to\r\nPaganini, was receiving an enthusiastic reception from audiences\r\n\"panting for the music which is divine.\" Upon this particular evening\r\nDr. Pyne sat next to me, when he suddenly exclaimed: \"If honorary\r\ndegrees were conferred upon musicians, Ole Bull would be Fiddle D.D.\" At\r\nanother time, when Dr. Edward Maynard, a well-known Washington dentist,\r\nwas remodeling his residence on Pennsylvania Avenue, now a portion of\r\nthe Columbia Hospital, Dr. Pyne was asked to what order of architecture\r\nit belonged and replied: \"_Tusk-can_, I suppose,\"--a pretty poor pun,\r\nbut no worse, perhaps, than most of those one hears nowadays. The Rev.\r\nDr. Pyne performed the marriage ceremony, at the \"chain buildings,\" of\r\nGeneral Scott's second daughter, Adeline Camilla, and Goold Hoyt of New\r\nYork. It was a quiet wedding and only the members of the family were\r\npresent. I remember the bride as one of the most beautiful women I have\r\never known; her face reminded me of a Roman cameo.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scott was something of an epicure. I have seen him sit down to a\r\nmeal where jowl was the principal dish, and have heard his exclamation\r\nof appreciation caused in part, possibly, by his recollection of similar\r\nfare in other days in Virginia. He did the family marketing personally,\r\nand was very discriminating in his selection of food. Terrapin, which\r\nhe insisted upon pronouncing t_a_rrapin, was his favorite dish, and he\r\nwould order oysters by the barrel from Norfolk. On one occasion he\r\nattended a banquet where all the States of the Union were represented by\r\na dish in some way characteristic of each commonwealth. Pennsylvania was\r\nrepresented by a bowl of sauer-kraut; and in speaking of the fact the\r\nnext morning the General remarked: \"I partook of it with tears in my\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\nNew Year's day in Washington was a festive occasion, especially in the\r\nhome where I was a guest. General and Mrs. Scott kept open house and of\r\ncourse most of the Army officers stationed in Washington, and some from\r\nthe Navy, called to pay their respects. All appeared in full-dress\r\nuniform, and a bountiful collation was served. I was present at several\r\nof these receptions and recall that after the festivities of the day\r\nwere nearly over General Scott, who of course had paid his respects to\r\nthe President earlier in the day, always called upon two venerable\r\nwomen--Mrs. \"Dolly\" Madison, who then lived in the house now occupied by\r\nthe Cosmos Club, and Mrs. Alexander Hamilton, his next door neighbor.\r\nDuring the winter of 1850, which I spent with the Scotts, I participated\r\nwith them in the various social enjoyments of the season.\r\n\r\nEarly in the month of January, 1851, and not long after the\r\nre-assembling of Congress, that genial gentleman, William W. Corcoran,\r\ngave his annual ball to both Houses of Congress, and it was in many ways\r\na notable entertainment. As this was long previous to the erection of\r\nhis public art gallery, his house was filled with many paintings and\r\npieces of statuary. Powers's \"Greek slave,\" which now occupies a\r\nconspicuous place in the Corcoran Art Gallery, stood in the\r\ndrawing-room. General Scott did not care especially for large evening\r\nentertainments, but he always attended those of Mr. Corcoran. In this\r\ninstance I was the only member of the household who accompanied him,\r\nand the ovation that awaited his arrival was enthusiastic; and as I\r\nentered the ballroom with him I received my full share of attention.\r\nAmong the prominent guests was General \"Sam\" Houston, arrayed in his\r\nblue coat, brass buttons and ruffled shirt. His appearance was patrician\r\nand his courtesy that of the inborn gentleman. I once laughingly\r\nremarked to General Scott that General Houston in some ways always\r\nrecalled to me the personal appearance of General Washington. His\r\nfacetious rejoinder was: \"Was ever the Father of his Country so\r\ndefamed?\" I met at this entertainment for the first time Charles Sumner,\r\nwho had but recently taken his seat in the U.S. Senate and of whom I\r\nshall speak hereafter. Caleb Cushing was also there, and Cornelia Marcy,\r\nthe beautiful daughter of William L. Marcy, was one of the belles of the\r\nball. I have stated that General Scott did not generally attend evening\r\nentertainments; in his own way, however, he took great interest in all\r\nsocial events, and upon my return from parties, sometimes at a very late\r\nhour, I have often found him awaiting my account of what had transpired.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of General Houston's appearance. I now wish to refer to\r\nhis fine sense of honor. He was married on the 22d of January, 1829, to\r\nMiss Eliza Allen, daughter of Colonel John Allen, from near Gallatin,\r\nthe county town of Sumner county in Tennessee, and separated from her\r\ndirectly after the marriage ceremony under, as is said, the most painful\r\ncircumstances. The wedding guests had departed and General Houston and\r\nhis bride were sitting alone by the fire, when he suddenly discovered\r\nthat she was weeping. He asked the cause of her tears and was told by\r\nher that she had never loved him and never could, but had married him\r\nsolely to please her father. \"I love Doctor Douglas,\" she added, \"but I\r\nwill try my best and be a dutiful wife to you.\" \"Miss,\" said Governor\r\nHouston, even waiving the fact that he had just married her, \"no white\r\nwoman shall be my slave; good-night.\" It is said that he mounted his\r\nhorse and rode to Nashville where he resigned at once his office as\r\nGovernor and departed for the Cherokee country, where and elsewhere his\r\nsubsequent career is well known. Having procured a divorce from his\r\nwife, he married Margaret Moffette in the spring of 1840.\r\n\r\nDuring the same winter I attended a party given by Mrs. Clement C. Hill,\r\nas a \"house-warming,\" at her residence on H Street. Many years later\r\nGeorge Bancroft, the historian, occupied this residence and it is still\r\ncalled the \"Bancroft house.\" Mr. Hill was a member of a prominent\r\nMaryland family which owned large estates in Prince George County, and\r\nhis wife was recognized as one of the social leaders in Washington.\r\n\r\nAnother ball which I recall, which I attended in company with the\r\nScotts, was given by Colonel and Mrs. William G. Freeman at their\r\nresidence on F Street, near Thirteenth Street, the former of whom was at\r\none time Chief of Staff to General Scott. I well remember that General\r\nScott accompanied his daughter and me and that he wore at the time the\r\nfull-dress uniform of his high rank. As he measured six feet four in his\r\nstocking-feet, the imposing nature of his appearance cannot well be\r\ndescribed. Mrs. Freeman, whose maiden name was Margaret Coleman, was one\r\nof the joint owners of the Cornwall coal mines in Pennsylvania. Her\r\nsister, Miss Sarah Coleman, shared her house for many years, and old\r\nWashingtonians remember her as the \"Lady Bountiful\" whose whole life was\r\ndevoted to good works. Colonel and Mrs. Freeman's two daughters, Miss\r\nIsabel Freeman and Mrs. Benjamin F. Buckingham, still reside in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe first guest whom I recall at this ball was the sprightly Mary Louisa\r\nAdams. She made her home with her grandfather, John Quincy Adams, who\r\nlived in one of the two white houses on F Street, between Thirteenth\r\nand Fourteenth Streets, now called the \"Adams house.\" She was the\r\nvenerable ex-President's principal heir, and subsequently married her\r\nrelative, William Clarkson Johnson of Utica. George B. McClellan was\r\nalso a guest at this entertainment as one of the young beaux. His\r\npresence made an indelible impression upon my memory as I was dancing a\r\ncotillion with him when, to my nervous horror, the pictures in the\r\nballroom began to spin and I made myself conspicuous by nearly fainting.\r\nI did not, however, lose consciousness like the heroines of the old\r\ntragedies, and was conducted to a retired seat where, at the request of\r\nGeneral Scott, I was attended by Dr. Richard Henry Coolidge, Surgeon in\r\nthe Army, who was also a guest. General Scott's admiration for this\r\ndistinguished gentleman, personally as well as professionally, was very\r\ngreat. I have often heard the General say that Dr. Coolidge not only\r\nprescribed for the physical condition of his patients but also by the\r\nexample of his Christian character elevated their moral tone. He\r\nconcluded his eulogy with the words: \"Dr. Coolidge walks humbly before\r\nhis God.\" His widow, Mrs. Harriet Morris Coolidge, daughter of Commodore\r\nCharles Morris, U.S.N., one of the distinguished heroes of the War of\r\n1812, is still living in Washington. I occasionally see her in her\r\npleasant home on L Street where she welcomes a large circle of friends,\r\ngiving one amid her pleasant surroundings a pleasing picture of a serene\r\nold age.\r\n\r\nDuring my many visits to the Scott household after the Mexican War, I\r\nalways occupied a comfortable brass camp bedstead which had formerly\r\nbelonged to the Mexican General, Santa Anna. It seems that just after\r\nthe battle of Cerro Gordo this warrior made a hasty flight, leaving\r\nbehind him his camp furniture and even, it is said, his wooden leg. This\r\nbedstead was captured as a trophy of war, and finally came into General\r\nScott's possession. The memory of this man's brutal deeds, however,\r\nnever disturbed my midnight repose. Texas history tells the story of the\r\nAlamo and of the six brave men there put to death by his orders,\r\nsuggesting in a certain degree the atrocities of the Duke of Cumberland\r\nof which I have already spoken. Santa Anna, however, had Indian blood in\r\nhis veins--an extenuating circumstance that cannot be offered in defense\r\nof the \"Butcher of Culloden.\"\r\n\r\nThere was always more or less gossip afloat concerning the alleged\r\nstrained relations existing between General and Mrs. Scott, owing\r\nlargely to the fact that the conditions attending and surrounding their\r\nrespective lives were fundamentally different and often misunderstood.\r\nGeneral Scott was a born commander while _Madame la Général_ from her\r\nearliest life had had the world at her feet. Such a combination\r\nnaturally resulted in an occasional discordant note, which unfortunately\r\nwas usually sounded in public. Their private life, however, was serene,\r\nand they were invariably loyal to each other's interests. When Mrs.\r\nScott, for example, learned that James Lyon of Richmond, an intimate\r\nfriend of the General and herself and a trustee for certain of her\r\nproperty, had, although a Whig, voted against her husband when a\r\npresidential candidate, she at once revoked his trusteeship. At another\r\ntime she wrote some attractive lines which she feelingly dedicated to\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nI recall an amusing incident related by General Scott just after a\r\njourney to Virginia that well illustrates the exigencies that awaited\r\npersons traveling in those days in carriages. For a brief period before\r\nthe inauguration of President Harrison, General Scott was in Richmond,\r\nand in due time, as he thought, started for the station to catch a train\r\nfor Washington to be present when the President-elect should take his\r\noath of office. He missed the train, however, and immediately secured a\r\ncarriage to convey him to Washington, as his presence there was\r\nimperative; but after a hard day's journey the horses could go no\r\nfurther, and he was obliged to seek shelter for the night. Stopping at a\r\nhouse near the roadside and inquiring whether he could be accommodated,\r\nhe was told that there was but one vacant room and that it had been\r\nengaged some days in advance by a German butcher, accompanied by his\r\nwife and daughter. This party meanwhile arrived and upon being informed\r\nof General Scott's predicament generously offered to share the room with\r\nhim. It was arranged that the women should occupy one of the beds and\r\nGeneral Scott and the butcher the other. The women, after retiring\r\nearly, gave the signal, \"All right,\" when the men took possession of the\r\nsecond bed. After some pretty fast traveling the next morning, General\r\nScott reached his destination. While he was relating this laughable\r\nexperience to us some years later, I inquired whether he had enjoyed a\r\ncomfortable rest. \"No,\" was his emphatic response, \"the butcher snored\r\nthe whole night.\" During this visit to Richmond, General Scott was\r\ninvited by an old friend to accompany her and her two sisters to a Roman\r\nCatholic church to hear some fine music. Upon arriving at the door they\r\nwere met by the sexton, who, somewhat flurried by seeing General Scott,\r\nannounced in stentorian tones the advent of the strangers--\"three cheers\r\n(chairs) for the Protestant ladies.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIGADIER GENERAL WINFIELD SCOTT, U.S.A., BY INGHAM.\r\n\r\n_The original portrait was burned many years ago_.]\r\n\r\nWhile I am relating Scott anecdotes, I must not omit to speak of an\r\namusing experience the old General was fond of relating which occurred\r\nwhile he was traveling in the West. In his official capacity he was a\r\nsojourner for a short period in Cincinnati, and, upon leaving that now\r\nprosperous city, he directed that P.P.C. cards be sent to all persons\r\nwho had called upon him. It seems that the social _convenances_ had not\r\nyet dawned upon this city, now the abode of arts and sciences, as the\r\ntown wiseacre, learned in many things as well as social lore, was\r\ncalled upon for an elucidation of the three mysterious letters.\r\nApparently he was not as able an exponent as was Daniel at Balshazzar's\r\nfeast, who so readily deciphered \"the handwriting on the wall.\" He\r\nconstrued the letters to signify _pour prendre café_, an invitation\r\nwhich was gladly accepted, much to General Scott's astonishment, who\r\ndecided then and there to confine himself in future to plain English.\r\n\r\nThe charming old resident society predominated in those days in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and wealth was not a controlling influence in\r\nsocial life. The condition of society was, therefore, different from\r\nthat of to-day, when apparently the\r\n\r\n    ... strongest castle, tower or town,\r\n    The golden bullet beateth down.\r\n\r\nThe old Washingtonians are now sometimes designated as \"cave dwellers,\"\r\nand, generally speaking, the public bows to the golden calf. The term\r\n\"old Washingtonians,\" as now used, applies to residents descended from\r\nthe original settlers of Maryland and Virginia, as well as to\r\nPresidential families and the representatives of Army and Navy officers\r\nof earlier days. Their social code is, in some respects, entirely\r\ndifferent and distinct from that of any other city, and was formed many\r\ndecades ago by the ancestors of the \"cave dwellers,\" who were so\r\npeculiarly versed in the varied requirements and adornments of social\r\nlife that to-day no radical innovations are acceptable to their\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Army and Navy, I am reminded of an amusing anecdote\r\nwhich has been generally circulated regarding the wife of a wealthy\r\nmanufacturer from a small western town who, after building a handsome\r\nhome in the heart of a fashionable section of the city, announced that\r\nher visiting list was growing so large that she must in some way reduce\r\nit and that she had decided to \"draw it\" on the Army and Navy. It seems\r\nalmost needless to say that this remark created much unfavorable\r\ncomment, as Washington is especially proud of the Army and Navy officers\r\nshe has nurtured.\r\n\r\nAmong the families who were socially prominent at the National Capital\r\nwhen I first knew it, were the Seatons, Gales, Lees, Freemans, Carrolls,\r\nTurnbulls, Hagners, Tayloes, Ramsays, Millers, Hills, Gouverneurs,\r\nMaynadiers, Grahams, Woodhulls, Jesups, Watsons, Nicholsons,\r\nWarringtons, Aberts, Worthingtons, Randolphs, Wilkes, Wainwrights, Roger\r\nJones, Pearsons, McBlairs, Farleys, Cutts, Walter Jones, Porters,\r\nEmorys, Woodburys, Dickens, Pleasantons, McCauleys, and Mays.\r\n\r\nI often recall with pleasure the days spent by me at Brentwood, a fine\r\nold country seat near Washington, and picture to my mind those forms of\r\n\"life and light\" arrayed in the charms of simplicity which were there\r\nportrayed. The far West had not then poured its coffers into the\r\nNational Capital, and the mining element of California was then unknown.\r\nIt is true that Washington, with its unpaved streets and poorly lighted\r\nthoroughfares, was then in a primitive condition, but it is just as true\r\nthat its social tone has never been surpassed. Brentwood was the\r\nresidence of Mrs. Joseph Pearson, who dispensed its hospitalities with\r\nease and elegance. For many years it was a social _El Dorado_, where\r\nresident society and distinguished strangers were always welcome.\r\nAlthough it was then remote from the heart of the city, most of its\r\nnumerous visitors were inclined to linger, once within its walls, to\r\nenjoy the charmed circle which surrounded the Pearson family. Both the\r\ndaughters of this house, Eliza, who married Carlisle P. Patterson,\r\nSuperintendent of the U.S. Coast Survey, and Josephine, who became the\r\nwife of Peter Augustus Jay of New York, were Washington beauties. Their\r\nsocial arena, however, was not confined to this city, as they made\r\nfrequent visits to New York, where they were regarded as great belles.\r\nChristine Kean, an old friend of mine who was a younger sister of Mrs.\r\nHamilton Fish, both of whom were daughters of Peter Philip James Kean of\r\nNew Jersey, was intimate with the \"Pearson girls,\" and made frequent\r\nvisits to Brentwood, where she shared in their social reign. Christine\r\nKean married William Preston Griffin, a naval officer from Virginia, who\r\nsurvived their marriage for only a few years. I was accustomed to call\r\nher \"sunshine\" as she carried joy and gladness to every threshold she\r\ncrossed. She was superintendent of nurses in the sanitary corps during\r\nthe Civil War, and as such rendered conspicuous service in the State of\r\nVirginia. She still resides in New York, admired and beloved by a large\r\ncircle of friends, and those charming traits of character which have\r\nalways made her so universally beloved are now hallowing the declining\r\nyears of her life.\r\n\r\nI often met Joseph C. G. Kennedy at General Scott's, usually called\r\n\"Census\" Kennedy. One day we were shocked to learn that Solon Borland,\r\nU.S. Senator from Arkansas, standing high in political circles but\r\ncalled by General Scott \"a western ruffian,\" had assaulted Mr. Kennedy\r\nand broken his nose. I knew both Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy in after life. He\r\nwas a gentleman of the old school, beloved and respected by everyone.\r\nHis death in 1887 was a shocking tragedy. A lunatic with a fancied\r\ngrievance met him on the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and Fifteenth\r\nStreet, and stabbed him. Mr. Kennedy was a grandson of Andrew Ellicott,\r\nwho, his descendants claim, conceived the original plans of the city of\r\nWashington instead of Pierre Charles l'Enfant, to whom they are\r\ngenerally attributed.\r\n\r\nWhile visiting in Washington I had the pleasure of renewing my\r\nacquaintance with Isaac Hull Adams of the Coast Survey. He was a\r\nbachelor, and his sister, Miss Elizabeth Combs Adams, always lived with\r\nhim. They were children of Judge Thomas Boylston Adams, a son of\r\nPresident John Adams, and resided in the old Adams homestead in Quincy,\r\nMassachusetts. I had originally known both of them in earlier life in\r\nNew York, and it was a sincere pleasure to meet them again. Miss Adams\r\nwas a generous and broad-minded woman who inherited the intellectuality\r\nof her ancestors. Her reminiscences of the White House during the Monroe\r\nadministration, when her uncle, John Quincy Adams, was Secretary of\r\nState, were of the deepest interest. She also loved to dwell upon the\r\ndays of the administration which followed, when she was a constant\r\nvisitor at the White House as the guest of her uncle, the President. I\r\ncalled upon her a few years ago in Quincy, while I was visiting in\r\nBoston, and found her living quietly in the old home, surrounded by her\r\nmany household gods. She died soon after I saw her, but the memory of\r\nher friendship is enduring.\r\n\r\nBefore making my visit to Quincy I wrote to Miss Adams asking her\r\nwhether she was equal to seeing me. She was then nearly ninety-two years\r\nold, having been born on the 9th of February, 1808. In a few days I\r\nreceived the following letter from her own pen:\r\n\r\n    21 ELM STREET, QUINCY, MASS., November 16, 1899.\r\n\r\n    My dear Mrs. Gouverneur:\r\n\r\n    I was very glad to receive your note saying that you would\r\n    come to see us in a few days. I am a very poor writer, not\r\n    holding the old pen of the \"ready writer,\" and my brother\r\n    Isaac Hull is a great invalid and not able to get about, so\r\n    lame.\r\n\r\n    I began two or three notes to you but my fingers are so stiff\r\n    I do not hold the pen, but wish to tell you that we shall be\r\n    glad to see you. We are both tired of being invalids. We do\r\n    not forget good old times far back in the century. The steam\r\n    cars leave Boston at the South Station. I think I sent you a\r\n    letter yesterday, but if you fail to get it, I shall be very\r\n    sorry.\r\n\r\n    I have so many letters to write and can but just keep the pen\r\n    going. It is a lovely day, but I never go out now and Isaac\r\n    Hull is suffering all sorts of pains. Comes down when he can.\r\n    Sorry to send such a poor sample. I have not been at Jamaica\r\n    Plain for two years.\r\n\r\n    We live in the oldest house and are the oldest couple in \"all\r\n    Connecticut,\" as Hull used to sing.\r\n\r\n         Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n              E. C. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n    As I say, the very oldest and the head of five generations. I\r\n    am so forgetful.\r\n\r\n\"Hull\" Adams, as he was generally called, had a fine tenor voice and I\r\nhave frequently heard him sing in duet with Archibald Campbell, who sang\r\nbass. Adams and Campbell were lifelong friends and were fellow students\r\nat West Point. The latter was graduated from West Point in 1835 and\r\nresigned from the Army in 1838. He subsequently became a civil engineer\r\nand was a Commissioner to establish the boundaries between the United\r\nStates and Canada. His wife was Miss Mary Williamson Harod of New\r\nOrleans, and a niece of Judge Thomas B. Adams. Her father, Charles\r\nHarod, who was president of the Atchafalaya Bank of New Orleans, was an\r\naide-de-camp to General Jackson at the battle of New Orleans and, with\r\nCommodore Daniel T. Patterson in command of our naval forces, met and\r\narranged with the pirate Jean Lafitte to bring in his men to fight on\r\nthe American side. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell were lifelong residents of the\r\nDistrict, where she is especially remembered for her many pleasing\r\ntraits. Their son, Charles H. Campbell, still resides in Washington and\r\nmarried a daughter of the late Admiral David D. Porter, U.S.N. For many\r\nyears, the Archibald Campbells lived on H Street in a house which is now\r\na portion of The Milton.\r\n\r\nI remember when Commander Matthew F. Maury, U.S.N., the distinguished\r\nauthor of \"The Geography of the Sea,\" was stationed in the old Naval\r\nObservatory and preparing those charts of the ocean which so gladdened\r\nthe hearts of mariners, quite unconscious meanwhile of the sensational\r\ncareer which awaited him. He and Mrs. Maury resided in Washington and,\r\naided by their daughters, dispensed a lavish hospitality. A few years\r\nlater, however, when Virginia seceded from the Union, Maury resigned\r\nfrom the Navy and linked his destiny with his native State. I learned\r\nmuch of his subsequent career from General John Bankhead Magruder, a\r\ndistant relative of my husband, who also resigned from the service and\r\nespoused the Southern cause. At the time of General Lee's surrender,\r\nMaury was in England and the following May sailed for St. Thomas, where\r\nhe heard of Lincoln's assassination. He then went to Havana, whence he\r\nsent his son to Virginia, and took passage for Mexico. He had approved\r\nof the efforts of the Archduke Maximilian to establish his empire in\r\nAmerica and had already written him a letter expressive of his sympathy.\r\nWithout waiting, however, for a reply he followed his letter, and upon\r\nhis arrival in Mexico in June was warmly welcomed by Maximilian, by whom\r\nhe was asked to accept a place in his Ministry; but the flattering offer\r\nwas declined and in its place he received an appointment as Director of\r\nthe Imperial Observatory. It seems superfluous to add what everyone\r\nknows, or ought to know, that Maury was a Christian gentleman of rare\r\naccomplishments and one of the most proficient scientists of his day.\r\n\r\nGeneral Magruder was with Maury when they learned of Lincoln's\r\nassassination, and accompanied him to Mexico, where he served as Major\r\nGeneral in Maximilian's army until the downfall of the usurping Emperor.\r\nIn referring to his experiences in Mexico he dwelt with much emphasis\r\nupon the Empress Carlota and her interesting personality. He described\r\nher as especially kind and sympathetic and as treating Maury and himself\r\nwith distinguished consideration at her court. This pleasing\r\nexperience, however, was not of long duration. A cloud hung over the\r\nMexican throne and it became apparent that Maximilian's reign was\r\ndrawing to a close. Realizing this state of affairs, Magruder and Maury\r\nleft Mexico, the former returning to the United States while the latter\r\nsailed for Europe. The Empress Carlota returned to Austria, leaving\r\nMaximilian to fight alone a hopeless cause. Louis Napoleon's vision of\r\nan European Empire on American soil soon vanished, and Maximilian's\r\ntragic death and Carlota's subsequent derangement caused a throb of\r\nsympathy which was felt throughout the civilized world.\r\n\r\nDuring the Mexican War, General Magruder, though a good officer and one\r\nof the bravest and most chivalrous of men, never lost sight of his\r\nposition in the _beau monde_. He never went into battle, however\r\npressing the emergency, without first brushing his hair well, smoothing\r\nhis mustache and arranging his toggery after the latest and most\r\napproved style. Often during the rage of the battle, while the shot were\r\nraining around him like hail and his men and horses and guns were\r\nexposed to a destructive and merciless fire, he would stand up with his\r\ntall, straight figure in full view of the Mexicans and, assuming the\r\nmost impressive and fashionable attitudes, would eye the enemy through\r\nhis glass with all the coolness and grace suited to a glance through an\r\nopera glass at a beautiful woman in an opposite box. I have always heard\r\nthat he could not be provoked by any circumstances to commit an impolite\r\nor an ungenteel act. But he came very near forfeiting his reputation in\r\nthis respect at the battle of Contreras. Upon being ordered to take a\r\ncertain position with his battery, he found himself exposed to a\r\nterrible fire from the enemy's big guns. In the midst of this hot fire,\r\nan aide of one of the generals, from whom Magruder had not received his\r\norder to occupy this position, rode up to the gallant officer and told\r\nhim that he had orders for him from General ----. \"But, my dear fellow,\"\r\ninterrupted the polite Captain, \"you must dismount and take a glass of\r\nwine with me; do--I have some excellent old Madeira.\" The aide\r\ndismounted and the wine was hastily drunk by the impatient young\r\nLieutenant, who did not enjoy it very much as there was a constant fire\r\nof grape and canister rattling about them all the time. But Captain\r\nMagruder desired very much to have a little agreeable chat over his\r\nwine, as, he remarked, it was no use popping away with his diminutive\r\npieces against the heavy guns of the enemy. \"But I am ordered by General\r\n---- to direct you to fall back, abandon your position, and shelter your\r\npieces,\" was the impatient response. \"My dear fellow,\" replied the\r\nCaptain, \"do take another sip of that wine--it is delicious!\" \"But you\r\nare ordered by General ---- to retire, Captain; and you are being cut\r\nup.\" \"Much obliged to you, my dear friend, but if you will only make\r\nyourself comfortable for a few minutes, I will get some sardines and\r\ncrackers.\" \"I must go,\" impatiently remarked the Lieutenant, mounting\r\nhis horse; \"what shall I report to the General?\" \"Well, my dear fellow,\r\nif you are determined to go, please present my compliments to General\r\n---- and tell him that, owing to a previous engagement with General\r\n----, I am under the necessity of informing him that before I leave this\r\nspot I will see him in the neighborhood of a certain gentleman whose\r\nname is not to be mentioned in polite society.\" So, at all events, goes\r\nthe story, and I presume we may believe as much or as little of it as we\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nGeneral Magruder, while our guest in our country home near Frederick, in\r\nMaryland, related to me many interesting incidents connected with\r\nMaury's career. The General seemed to possess an unusual appreciation of\r\nthe good things of life and told me with much gusto about the numerous\r\ndelicacies with which Mexico abounded. His descriptions served to\r\nrecall to my mind the fact that when he was in our regular army he had\r\nthe reputation of \"faring sumptuously every day.\" When in command at\r\nNewport, Rhode Island, he gave a ball, during which he employed the\r\nservices of some of the soldiers under his command for domestic\r\npurposes, and for this act was reprimanded by the War Department. After\r\nthe Civil War he went to Texas and died in Houston in the winter of\r\n1871. He was a brave soldier and was twice brevetted for gallantry and\r\nmeritorious conduct on the battlefields of the Mexican War.\r\n\r\nGeneral John B. Magruder and his brother, Captain George A. Magruder of\r\nthe Navy, who early in life became orphans, were brought up by their\r\nmaternal uncle, General James Bankhead, U.S.A. General \"Jack\" Magruder,\r\nas he was usually called, developed rather lively traits of character,\r\nwhile his younger brother George was so deeply religious that, during\r\nhis naval career, his nickname was \"St. George of the Navy.\" When both\r\nyoung men had reached manhood, General Bankhead read them a homily,\r\nhaving special reference, however, to his nephew \"Jack.\" \"I have reared\r\nyou both with the utmost care and circumspection,\" he said, \"but you,\r\nJohn, have not my approval in many ways.\" Jack's response was\r\ncharacteristic. \"Uncle,\" he said, \"I can account for it in the following\r\nmanner--George has followed your precepts, but I have followed your\r\nexample.\" At the outbreak of the Civil War, Captain Magruder resigned\r\nfrom the Navy and went with his family to Canada, where his daughter\r\nHelen married James York MacGregor Scarlett, whose title of nobility was\r\nLord Abinger, his father having been raised to the peerage as a \"lower\r\nLord.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Virginia family of social prominence, whose members mingled much\r\nin Washington society while I was still visiting the Winfield Scotts,\r\nwas that of the Masons of \"Colross,\" the name of their old homestead\r\nnear Alexandria in Virginia. Mrs. Thomson F. Mason was usually called\r\nMrs. \"Colross\" Mason to distinguish her from another family by the same\r\nname, that of James M. Mason, United States Senator from Virginia. The\r\nfamily thought nothing of the drive to Washington, and no entertainment\r\nwas quite complete without the \"Mason girls,\" who were especially bright\r\nand attractive young women. Open house was kept at this delightful\r\ncountry seat and many were the pleasant parties given there. One of the\r\ndaughters, Matilda, married Charles H. Rhett, a representative South\r\nCarolinian, and my friend, Cornelia Scott, was one of her bridesmaids.\r\nFlorence, another sister, who was generally called \"Folly,\" married\r\nCaptain Thomas G. Rhett of the Army, a brother of her sister's husband.\r\nHe resigned at the beginning of the Civil War, as a South Carolinian\r\nwould indeed have been a _rara avis_ in the Federal Army in 1861, and\r\nbecame an officer in the Confederate Army; while from 1870 to 1873 he\r\nwas a Colonel of Ordnance in the Army of the Khedive. Miss Betty Mason,\r\nthe oldest of these sisters, was a celebrated beauty and became the wife\r\nof St. George Tucker Campbell of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time I first made the acquaintance of Emily Virginia\r\nMason, who recently died in Georgetown after a long and active life. We\r\nwere accustomed to have long conversations over the tea table concerning\r\nbygone days, and I sadly miss her bright presence. Her memories of a\r\nvaried life both in Washington and Paris were highly entertaining and as\r\none of her auditors I never grew weary while listening to her graphic\r\ndescriptions of persons and things. She was a daughter of John T. Mason\r\nand a sister of Stevens Thompson Mason, the first governor of Michigan,\r\noften called the \"Boy Governor.\" She was very active during the Civil\r\nWar as a Confederate nurse and continued her kindly acts thereafter in\r\nother fields of benevolence. She wrote a life of General Robert E. Lee\r\nand several other books, and made a compilation of \"Southern Poems of\r\nthe War,\" which was subsequently published under that title.\r\n\r\nOne may readily turn from Emily Virginia Mason to her life-long friend,\r\nthe daughter of Senator William Wright of New Jersey. It was during her\r\nfather's official life in Washington that Miss Katharine Maria Wright\r\nmet and married Baron Johan Cornelis Gevers, _Chargé d'affaires_ from\r\nHolland to the United States. After her marriage she seldom visited her\r\nnative country but made her home in Holland until her death a few years\r\nago. Her son also entered the diplomatic service of his country and a\r\nfew years ago was living in Washington.\r\n\r\nAfter my father's death we continued as a family to live in our Houston\r\nStreet home in New York, but in 1853 we found the character of the\r\nneighborhood, which had been so pleasant in years gone by, changing so\r\nrapidly that we sold our house and moved to Washington. We secured a\r\npleasant old-fashioned residence on G Street, between Seventeenth and\r\nEighteenth Streets, which in subsequent years became the Weather Bureau.\r\nNext door to us lived Mrs. Graham and her daughter, Mrs. Henry K.\r\nDavenport, the grandmother and mother respectively of Commodore Richard\r\nG. Davenport, U.S.N. Mrs. Graham was the widow of George Graham, who,\r\nfor a time during Monroe's administration, acted as Secretary of War.\r\nWhile he was serving in this capacity, his brother, John Graham, was a\r\nmember of the same cabinet, serving as Secretary of State. Mrs.\r\nDavenport was the mother of a family of sons known familiarly to the\r\nneighborhood as Tom, Dick and Harry. In the same block lived Mr.\r\nJefferson Davis, who was then in the Senate from Mississippi. I remember\r\nhearing Mrs. Davis say that it was worth paying additional rent to live\r\nnear Mrs. Graham, as she had such an attractive personality and was such\r\na kind and attentive neighbor. A few doors the other side of us resided\r\nCaptain and Mrs. Henry C. Wayne, the former of whom was in the Army and\r\nwas the son of James M. Wayne of Georgia, a Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt; while across the street was the French Legation. Next door, at\r\nthe corner of G and Eighteenth Streets, lived Edward Everett. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Robert D. Wainwright lived on the next block in a house now\r\noccupied by General and Mrs. A. W. Greely. I attended the wedding of\r\nMiss Henrietta Wainwright, soon after we arrived in Washington, to\r\nWilliam F. Syng of the British Legation. She was the aunt of\r\nRear-Admiral Richard Wainwright, U.S.N., who, as Commanding Officer of\r\nthe _Gloucester_, rendered such conspicuous service at the battle of\r\nSantiago. Not far away, on the corner of Twenty-first and G Streets,\r\nlived Lieutenant Maxwell Woodhull of the Navy and his wife; and their\r\nchildren still reside in the same house. On F Street, near Twenty-first\r\nStreet, was the home of Colonel William Turnbull, U.S.A., whose wife was\r\na sister of General George Douglas Ramsay, U.S.A., who was so well known\r\nto all old Washingtonians. General Ramsay was very social in his tastes,\r\nand many years before this time he and Columbus Monroe were the\r\ngroomsmen at the wedding at the White House when John Adams, the son of\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, married his first cousin, Miss Mary Hellen. General\r\nand Mrs. Ramsay lived on Twenty-first Street, not far from his sister,\r\nMrs. William Turnbull. Mrs. John Farley (Anna Pearson), a half-sister of\r\nMrs. Carlisle P. Patterson, lived on F Street, near Twenty-first Street,\r\nand the latter's sister, Mrs. Peter Augustus Jay (Josephine Pearson),\r\nbegan her matrimonial life on the northwest corner of F and Twenty-first\r\nStreets.\r\n\r\nWilliam Thomas Carroll's residence on the corner of Eighteenth and F\r\nStreets witnessed a continuous scene of hospitality. Mrs. Carroll was\r\nnever happier than when entertaining. She lived to an advanced age, and\r\nuntil almost the very last, remained standing while receiving her\r\nguests. I have heard that she retained two sets of servants, one for the\r\ndaytime and the other for the night. In her drawing-room hung many\r\nportraits of family ancestors arrayed in the antique dress of olden\r\ntimes. She was a daughter of Governor Samuel Sprigg of Maryland and was\r\na handsome and accomplished woman. Her four daughters, who materially\r\nassisted her in dispensing hospitality, were very popular young women.\r\nVioletta Lansdale, the oldest, married Dr. William Swann Mercer of the\r\nwell-known Virginia family; Sally is the present Countess Esterhazy;\r\nCarrie married the late T. Dix Bolles of the Navy; and Alida is the wife\r\nof the late John Marshall Brown of Portland, Maine. The Carroll house is\r\nstill standing and became the residence of the late Chief Justice\r\nMelville Fuller of the U.S. Supreme Court. I have always heard that the\r\nCarroll house, a substantial structure with large rooms, was built by\r\nTench Ringgold, who was U.S. Marshal of the District of Columbia longer\r\nthan any of his predecessors. He occupied this position during the whole\r\nof President Monroe's administration, and I have heard it related in the\r\nGouverneur family that, when Monroe was retiring from office, he asked\r\nhis successor, John Quincy Adams, on personal grounds, to retain Mr.\r\nRinggold. This request was granted and Mr. Monroe made the same appeal\r\nto Andrew Jackson shortly after the latter's inauguration, and received\r\nthe cordial response, \"Don't mention it, don't mention it.\" On the\r\nstrength of this interview, Ringgold naturally assumed he was safe for\r\nanother term, but, to the surprise of many, he was succeeded two years\r\nlater by Henry Ashton, who retained the office for about three years.\r\n\"Old Hickory,\" as everybody knows, had a mind of his own.\r\n\r\nIt was often very pleasant in my new surroundings to welcome to\r\nWashington some of my early New York friends; and among these none were\r\nmore gladly received than Frances and Julia Kellogg of Troy. My\r\nintimacy with these sisters goes back as far as my school days at Madame\r\nChegaray's, where Frances Kellogg was a boarding pupil and in a class\r\nhigher than mine when I was a day-scholar. It was the habit of these\r\nsisters to spend their winters in Washington and their summers at West\r\nPoint; and it was during their sojourn at the latter place that Frances\r\nbecame engaged to George H. Thomas of the Army who, although a Virginian\r\nby birth, rendered such distinguished services during our Civil War as\r\nCommander of the Army of the Cumberland. Many years after General\r\nThomas's death, his widow built a house on I Street, where she and Miss\r\nKellogg presided during the remainder of their lives. During one of our\r\nmany conversations, Mrs. Thomas told me that when her husband was\r\ninformed that a house was about to be presented to him by admiring\r\nfriends, in recognition of his conspicuous services during the Civil\r\nWar, he at once declined the offer, saying that he had been sufficiently\r\nremunerated, and requested that the money raised for the purpose should\r\nbe given in charity. A distinguished Union General, who had already\r\naccepted a house, remonstrated with him and said: \"Thomas, if you refuse\r\nto accept that house it will make it awkward for us.\" General Thomas's\r\ncharacteristic response was: \"You may take as many houses as you please,\r\nbut I shall accept none.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time the house 14 Lafayette Square, now Jackson Place, still\r\nstanding but very much altered, was owned and occupied by Purser and\r\nMrs. Francis B. Stockton and the latter's sister, daughters of Captain\r\nJames McKnight of the Marine Corps and nieces of Commodore Stephen\r\nDecatur. Purser Stockton once told me that he had purchased this home\r\nfor seven thousand dollars. The house prior to his ownership had been\r\nthe residence of a number of families of distinction, among others the\r\nSouthards and Monroes.\r\n\r\nAfter giving up our home in New York I made a visit of some weeks to my\r\nfriends, the family of William Kemble, who was still residing on St.\r\nJohn's Park in New York. While there we were invited to an old-fashioned\r\nsupper at the home of Mr. Peter Goelet, a bachelor, on the corner of\r\nNineteenth Street and Broadway, presided over by his sister, Mrs. Hannah\r\nGreene Gerry. Upon the lawn of this house Mr. Goelet indulged his\r\nornithological tastes by a remarkable display of various species of\r\nturkeys with their broods, together with peacocks and silver and golden\r\npheasants. As can be readily understood, this was a remarkable sight in\r\nthe heart of a great city, and caused much admiration from passers-by.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that at one time William W. Corcoran's father kept a\r\nshoe store in Georgetown, and that the son, one of the most conspicuous\r\nbenefactors of the city of Washington, was very proud of the fact. I\r\nhave also heard it said, although I cannot vouch for the truth of the\r\nstatement, that the son cherished his father's business sign as one of\r\nhis valued possessions. Whether or not these allegations agree or\r\nconflict with the explicit statement concerning his father made by\r\nWilliam W. Corcoran himself, is left for others to judge. The latter\r\nwrote concerning his father: \"Thomas Corcoran came to Baltimore in 1783,\r\nand entered into the service of his uncle, William Wilson, as clerk,\r\nbeginning with a salary of fifty pounds sterling a year.... He brought\r\nhis family to Georgetown and commenced the shoe and leather business on\r\nCongress Street,\" etc., etc. Be the facts as they may, a witticism of\r\nWilliam Thomas Carroll was a _bon mot_ of the day many years ago in\r\nWashington. Upon being asked upon one occasion whether he knew the elder\r\nMr. Corcoran, he replied: \"I have known him from first to _last_ and\r\nfrom _last_ to first.\" Mr. Carroll for thirty-six years was Clerk of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, and Chief Justice Roger B. Taney\r\npaid him a well-earned tribute when he stated that he was \"an\r\naccomplished and faithful officer, prompt and exact in business, and\r\ncourteous in manner, and during the whole period of his judicial life\r\ndischarged the duties of his office with justice to the public and the\r\nsuitors, and to the entire satisfaction of every member of the Court.\"\r\n\r\nAt the period of which I am speaking, some of the clerical positions in\r\nthe various departments of the government were filled by members of\r\nfamilies socially prominent. Francis S. Markoe and Robert S. Chew, for\r\nexample, were clerks in the State Department, and Archibald Campbell and\r\nJames Madison Cutts held similar positions. For many years women were\r\nnot employed by the government. It is said that the first one regularly\r\nappointed was Miss Jennie Douglas, and that she received her position\r\nthrough the instrumentality of Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, at the request of General Francis E. Spinner, Treasurer of the\r\nUnited States. She was assigned to the duty of cutting and trimming\r\ntreasury-notes, a task that had hitherto been performed with shears by\r\nmen. General Spinner subsequently stated that her first day's work\r\n\"settled the matter in her and in women's favor.\" James Madison Cutts,\r\nat one time Second Comptroller of the Treasury under Buchanan, married\r\nEllen Elisabeth O'Neill, who, with her sister Rose, subsequently Mrs.\r\nRobert Greenhow, resided in the vicinity of Washington. Both sisters\r\npossessed much physical beauty. Madison Cutts, as he was generally\r\ncalled, was a nephew of \"Dolly\" Madison, and his father, Richard Cutts,\r\nwas once a Member of Congress from New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nIt is to the kindness of Mrs. Madison Cutts that I owe the memory of a\r\npleasant visit to Mrs. Madison. She took me to call upon her one\r\nafternoon, and I shall never forget the impression made upon me by her\r\nturban and long earrings. Her surroundings were of a most interesting\r\ncharacter and her graceful bearing and sprightly presence, even in\r\nextreme old age, have left a lasting picture upon my memory. Her niece,\r\n\"Dolly\" Paine, was living with her at her residence on the corner of H\r\nStreet and Madison Place, now forming a part of the Cosmos Club. Todd\r\nPaine, her son, unfortunately did not prove to be a source of much\r\nsatisfaction to her. He survived his mother some years and eventually\r\nthe valuable Madison manuscripts and relics became his property. At the\r\ntime of his death in Virginia this interesting collection was brought to\r\nWashington, where, I am informed, some of it still remains as the\r\ncherished possession of the McGuire family. Mr. and Mrs. Madison Cutts\r\nwere devotees of society and consequently they and Mrs. Madison met upon\r\ncommon ground. The afternoon of my memorable visit to this former\r\nmistress of the White House I remember meeting quite a number of\r\nvisitors in her drawing-room, as temporary sojourners at the National\r\nCapital were often eager to meet the gracious woman who had figured so\r\nconspicuously in the social history of the country.\r\n\r\nI knew Madison Cutts's daughter, Rose Adele Cutts, or \"Addie\" Cutts, as\r\nshe was invariably called, when she first entered society. Her\r\nreputation for beauty is well known. I always associate her with\r\njaponicas, which she usually wore in her hair and of which her numerous\r\nbouquets were chiefly composed. Her father frequently accompanied her to\r\nballs, and in the wee small hours of the night, as he became weary, I\r\nhave often been amused at his summons to depart--\"Addie, _allons_.\" As\r\nquite a young woman, Addie Cutts married Stephen A. Douglas, the \"Little\r\nGiant,\" whom Lincoln defeated in the memorable presidential election of\r\n1860. It is said that her ambition to grace the White House had much to\r\ndo with the disruption of the Democratic party, as it was she who urged\r\nDouglas onward; and everyone knows that the division of the Democratic\r\nvote between Stephen A. Douglas and John C. Breckenridge resulted in the\r\nelection of Lincoln. Some years after Douglas's death, his widow married\r\nGeneral Robert Williams, U.S.A., by whom she had a number of children,\r\none of whom is the wife of Lieutenant Commander John B. Patton, U.S.N.\r\n\r\nMrs. Madison Cutts's sister, Mrs. Robert Greenhow, was a woman of\r\nattractive appearance and unusual ability. Her husband was a Virginian\r\nby birth and a man of decided literary tastes. When I first knew her she\r\nwas a widow, and but few romances can excel in interest one period of\r\nher career. She was a social favorite and her house was the rendezvous\r\nof the prominent Southern politicians of the day. This, of course, was\r\nbefore the Civil War, during a portion of which she made herself\r\nconspicuous as a Southern spy. At the commencement of the struggle her\r\nzeal for the Southern cause became so conspicuous and offensive to the\r\nauthorities in Washington that she was arrested and imprisoned in her\r\nown house on Sixteenth Street, near K Street. Later she was confined in\r\nthe \"Old Capitol Prison.\" General Andrew Porter, U.S.A., whose widow\r\nstill resides in Washington and is one of my cherished friends, was\r\nProvost Marshal of the District of Columbia at this time, and as such\r\nMrs. Greenhow was in his charge during her imprisonment. This duty was\r\nmade so irksome to him that, upon one occasion, he exclaimed in\r\ndesperation that he preferred to resign his position rather than to\r\ncontinue such an uncongenial task. It has been stated that information\r\nconveyed by her to the Confederates precipitated the Battle of Bull Run,\r\nwhich was so disastrous to the Union Army. Her conduct, even in prison,\r\nwas so aggressive that the government officials decided she was\r\naltogether too dangerous a character to remain in Washington. They\r\naccordingly sent her, accompanied by her young daughter Rose, within the\r\nSouthern lines, fearing that even behind prison bars her ingenuity\r\nmight devise some method of communicating with the enemy. From the South\r\nshe went to London, where she published, in 1863, a volume entitled, \"My\r\nImprisonment and the First Years of Abolition Rule at Washington,\" to\r\nwhich I have already referred. I have heard that this book had quite a\r\ncirculation in Great Britain, but that an attempt was made to suppress\r\nit in the United States. The last year of the war, Mrs. Greenhow was\r\nreturning to America with considerable money acquired by the sale of her\r\nbook, which she carried with her in gold. She took passage upon a\r\nblockade-runner which, after pursuit, succeeded in reaching the port of\r\nWilmington, North Carolina. She was descending from her ship into a\r\nsmall boat to go on shore when she made a false step and fell into the\r\nwater. Her gold tied around her neck held her down and she was drowned.\r\nHer remains were recovered and brought to the town hall, where they laid\r\nin state prior to an imposing funeral service. She was regarded\r\nthroughout the South as a martyr to its cause.\r\n\r\nOld Washingtonians who recall Mrs. Greenhow's eventful career will\r\nassociate with her, in a way, Mrs. Philip Phillips, who was also active\r\nin the Southern cause, and whose husband represented Alabama with much\r\nability for one term in Congress. He subsequently remained in\r\nWashington, where he was known as a distinguished advocate before the\r\nSupreme Court. Mrs. Phillips's enthusiastic friendship for the South\r\nmade serious trouble for herself and family. The first year of the war,\r\nall of them were sent across the Union lines, and went to New Orleans,\r\nwhere General Benjamin F. Butler was in command. A few days after her\r\narrival she Was brought before him charged with \"making merry\" over the\r\npassing funeral of Captain George Coleman De Kay of New York, an officer\r\nin the Union Army. When General Butler inquired why she laughed, she\r\nreplied: \"Because I was in a good humor.\" Unable longer to suppress his\r\nindignation, Butler exclaimed: \"If such women as you and Mrs. Greenhow\r\nare let loose, our lives are in jeopardy.\" Mrs. Phillips's reply was:\r\n\"We of the South hire butchers to kill our swine.\" Another day a search\r\nwas made in Mrs. Phillips's house for information concerning the\r\nConfederacy which she was thought to have. When personally searched and\r\ncompelled to remove her shoes, she suggested that it was impossible for\r\na Northern man to get his hand inside a Southern woman's shoe. General\r\nButler finally ordered Mrs. Phillips to be confined on an island near\r\nNew Orleans, and placed over her a guard whose duty it was to watch her\r\nnight and day. I have often heard her give an account of her life under\r\nthese trying circumstances. She said she lived in a large \"shoe\r\nbox\"--whatever that meant--and that her meals were served to her three\r\ntimes a day upon a tin plate. From what I have already said, it is\r\napparent that she was an exceedingly witty woman. One day, while walking\r\non the streets in Washington, she was joined by a distinguished prelate\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church, and inquired whether he could lay aside\r\nhis cloth long enough to listen to a conundrum? Upon receiving a\r\nfavorable response, she asked: \"Why is His Holiness, the Pope, like a\r\ngoose?\" The reply was: \"Because he sticks to his Propaganda!\"\r\n\r\nI shall always recall with pleasure a dinner party I attended at the\r\nresidence of Edward Everett. As Mrs. Everett was in very delicate health\r\nand seldom appeared in public, Mr. Everett presided alone. The\r\ninvitations were for six o'clock, and dinner was served promptly at that\r\nhour. I was taken into the dining-room by Mr. Philip Griffith, one of\r\nthe Secretaries of the British Legation. We had just finished our second\r\ncourse when, to the surprise of everyone, a tall and gaunt gentleman was\r\nushered into the dining-room. It was Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia,\r\nthen a member of Congress and subsequently Vice-President of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy. Mr. Everett at once arose and shook hands with Mr.\r\nStephens and with an imperturbable expression of countenance motioned\r\nthe butler to provide another seat at the table. For a moment there was\r\na slight confusion, as the other guests were obliged to move in order to\r\nmake room for the new comer; but everything was speedily arranged and\r\nMr. Stephens began his dinner with the third course. No explanation was\r\noffered at the moment, but later, while we were drinking our coffee in\r\nthe drawing-room, I noticed Mr. Everett and Mr. Stephens engaged in\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nA few days later, through Mr. Colin M. Ingersoll, a Representative in\r\nCongress from Connecticut, the cause of Mr. Stephens' late appearance at\r\nthe dinner was made clear to me. It seems that Mr. Everett and the\r\nFrench Minister, the Count Eugène de Sartiges, his next door neighbor,\r\nwere giving dinner parties the same evening. The dinner hour at the\r\nFrench Legation was half-past six o'clock, while Mr. Everett's was half\r\nan hour earlier. Through the mistake of a stupid coachman, Mr. Stephens\r\nwas landed at the door of Count de Sartiges's home and entered it under\r\nthe impression that it was Mr. Everett's residence. He walked into the\r\ndrawing-room and suspected nothing, as nearly all the guests were\r\nfamiliar to him. Count de Sartiges, however, surprised at the presence\r\nof an unbidden guest, anxiously inquired of Mr. Ingersoll the name of\r\nthe stranger, and upon being informed remarked: \"I'll be very polite to\r\nhim.\" Seating himself by Mr. Stephens' side, an animated conversation\r\nfollowed. Meanwhile other guests arrived and the Count de Sartiges\r\nbecame diverted, while Mr. Stephens, still unconscious of his mistake,\r\nturned to Mr. Ingersoll, who stood near, and in an irritated tone of\r\nvoice said: \"Who is this Frenchman who is tormenting me, and where is\r\nMr. Everett?\" Mr. Ingersoll explained that the Frenchman was the Count\r\nde Sartiges, and that Mr. Everett was probably presiding over his own\r\ndinner in the adjoining house.\r\n\r\nMy _vis à vis_ at Mr. Everett's table was Miss Ann G. Wight, a woman\r\nwith an unusual history. She was born in Montgomery County, Maryland,\r\nand as a child was placed in a convent. She eventually became a nun and\r\nan inmate of the Convent of the Visitation in Georgetown, where she\r\nassumed the name of \"Sister Gertrude.\" She was an intellectual woman and\r\nwas deeply beloved by her associates. Without any apparent cause,\r\nhowever, she planned an escape from the convent and sought the residence\r\nof her relative, General John P. Van Ness, dropping her keys, as I have\r\nunderstood, in Rock Creek as she passed over the Georgetown bridge. Mrs.\r\nCharles Worthington, a Catholic friend of mine who was educated at this\r\nsame convent, gave me the following explanation of her conduct: There\r\nwas an election for Mother Superior, and Miss Wight, deeply disappointed\r\nthat she was not chosen to fill the position, was dissatisfied and when\r\nit became her turn to answer the front-door bell, suddenly determined to\r\nleave. She was, however, recognized by one of the priests, who followed\r\nher to General Van Ness's residence, where he insisted upon seeing her.\r\nAt first she refused to meet him, but, upon informing the General that\r\nhe must learn from her own lips whether her departure was voluntary, she\r\nconsented to see him in the presence of her relative. She admitted that\r\nshe had in no way been influenced. When I first met Miss Wight she was\r\nmore devoted to \"the pride, pomp and circumstance\" of the world than\r\nmany who had not led such deeply religious lives. She was still living\r\nat the residence of General Van Ness, and I have heard that she always\r\nremained a Roman Catholic. During the Everett dinner my escort, Mr.\r\nPhilip Griffith, remarked to me in an undertone: \"We have an escaped nun\r\nhere; are we going to have an _auto da fé_?\" I responded that I believed\r\nit to be a matter of record that _autos da fé_ were solely a courtly\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sidney Brooks, formerly Miss Fanny Dehon of Boston, was another of\r\nMr. Everett's guests. She was a relative of our host, and it was her\r\ncustom to make prolonged visits to the Everett home. Her presence in\r\nWashington was always hailed with delight. She was a pronounced blonde,\r\nand her reputation as a brilliant conversationalist was widely extended.\r\n\r\nRufus Choate was an occasional visitor in Washington subsequent to his\r\nbrilliant senatorial career which ended in 1845. That I had the pleasure\r\nof intimately knowing this man of wit and erudition is one of the\r\nbrightest memories of my life. His quaint humor was inexhaustible and\r\nsome of his bright utterances will never perish. When a younger sister\r\nof mine was lying desperately ill in Washington in 1856 he called to\r\ninquire about her condition, and the tones of his sympathetic voice\r\nstill linger in my ear. It has been fittingly said of Mr. Choate that\r\neven one's name uttered by him was in itself a delicate compliment. It\r\nis to him we owe the inspiring quotation, \"Keep step to the music of the\r\nUnion,\" which he uttered in his speech before the Whig convention of\r\n1855. I have heard some of Mr. Choate's clients dwell upon his mighty\r\npower as an advocate, and it seems to me that words of law flowing from\r\nsuch lips might have been suggestive of the harmony of the universe. The\r\nchirography of Mr. Choate was equal to any Chinese puzzle; it was even\r\nmore difficult to decipher than that of Horace Greeley. I once received\r\na note from him and was obliged to call upon my family to aid me in\r\nreading it. He had a fund of humor which was universally applauded by an\r\nadmiring public. Once, in replying to a toast on Yale College at the\r\n\"Hasty-Pudding\" dinner, he said that \"everything is to be irregular this\r\nevening.\" He followed this remark by poking a little fun at the expense\r\nof the College by reading a portion of the will of Lewis Morris, one of\r\nthe Signers and the father of Gouverneur Morris. This document was\r\nexecuted in 1760 in New York, and in it he expresses his \"desire that my\r\nson, Gouverneur Morris, may have the best education that is to be had in\r\nEurope or America, but my express will and directions are that he be\r\nnever sent for that purpose to the Colony of Connecticutt, lest he\r\nshould imbibe in his youth that low craft and cunning so incident to the\r\nPeople of that Colony, which is so interwoven in their Constitutions\r\nthat all their art cannot disguise it from the World; though many of\r\nthem, under the sanctifyed garb of Religion, have endeavored to impose\r\nthemselves on the World for honest men.\" The laughter which followed the\r\nreading of this extract was as _regular_ as the remarks were\r\n_irregular_. It may be added that Lewis Morris died two years after\r\nmaking this will, when his son Gouverneur was between ten and eleven\r\nyears of age, and that his desires were respected, as his son was\r\ngraduated from King's (now Columbia) College in New York in 1768, when\r\nonly sixteen years old. His father, cold in the grave, had his revenge\r\non the \"Colony of Connecticutt\" and the hatchet, for aught we know to\r\nthe contrary, was forever buried, while old Elihu's college still\r\nsurvives in New Haven.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote relating to Gouverneur Morris still lingers in my memory.\r\nBefore his marriage, quite late in life, to Miss Anne Cary Randolph, his\r\nnephew, Gouverneur Wilkins, was generally regarded as heir to his large\r\nestate. When a direct heir was born, Mr. Wilkins was summoned to the\r\nbabe's christening. One of the guests began to speculate upon the name\r\nof the youngster, when Mr. Wilkins quickly said, \"Why, _Cut-us-off-sky_,\r\nof course,\" in imitation of the usual termination of such a large number\r\nof Russian names.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 John F. T. Crampton was British Minister to the United States\r\nand I had the pleasure of knowing him quite well. He was a bachelor of\r\ncommanding presence, and it was rather a surprise to Washingtonians that\r\nhe evaded matrimonial capture! He lived in Georgetown in an old-time and\r\nspacious mansion, surrounded by ample grounds. The proverbial\r\ntea-drinking period had not arrived, but Mr. Crampton, notwithstanding\r\nthis fact, gave afternoon receptions for which his house, by the way,\r\nwas especially adapted. In 1856, during the Crimean War, an\r\nunpleasantness arose between Great Britain and this country in\r\nconnection with the charge that Crampton had been instrumental in\r\nrecruiting soldiers in the United States for service in the British\r\nArmy. Accordingly, in May of the same year, President Pierce broke off\r\ndiplomatic relations with him and he was recalled. There was never,\r\nhowever, any severe reflection made upon him by his home Ministry, and\r\nafter his return to England he was made a Knight of the Bath by Lord\r\nPalmerston, and a little later became the British Minister at St.\r\nPetersburg. In the autumn of 1856, while in Russia, he married Victoire\r\nBalfe, second daughter of Michael William Balfe, the distinguished\r\nmusical composer, from whom he was divorced in 1863.\r\n\r\nI frequently attended receptions at the British Legation, and I\r\nparticularly recall those in the spring of the year when they took the\r\nform of _fêtes champêtres_ upon the well-kept lawn. On these occasions\r\nthe Diplomatic Corps was well represented, as well as the resident\r\nsociety. I have heard a curious story about Henry Stephen Fox, the\r\nEnglish Minister in Washington from 1836 to 1844. He evidently\r\nrepresented the sporting element of his day, as it was said he was _en\r\névidence_ all night and seldom visible by daylight. He was, moreover,\r\nexceedingly careless about some of the reasonable responsibilities of\r\nlife which rendered it difficult for his creditors to secure an\r\naudience. They, however, surrounded his house in the First Ward one\r\nevening and demanded in clamorous tones that he should name a definite\r\ntime when he would satisfy their claims. Fox appeared at a front window\r\nand pleasantly announced that, as they were so urgent in their demands,\r\nhe would state a time which he hoped would meet with their satisfaction,\r\nand accordingly named in stentorian voice the \"Day of Judgment.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the constant visitors at our home on G Street was John\r\nSavile-Lumley, who was appointed in 1854 as the Secretary of the British\r\nLegation under Crampton, and in the following year became the English\r\n_Chargé d'affaires_ in Washington. I remember him as a fine looking\r\ngentleman and an especially pleasing specimen of the English race. He\r\nwas the natural son of John Lumley-Savile, the eighth Earl of\r\nScarborough, by a mother of French origin. After leaving Washington, he\r\nrepresented his country in Rome and other prominent courts of Europe,\r\nand, upon his retirement from the diplomatic service in 1888, was raised\r\nto the peerage as Baron Savile of Rufford in Nottinghamshire. The last I\r\nheard of him was through one of Lord Ronald Gower's charming books of\r\ntravel, where it states that he was representing Great Britain at the\r\ncourt of Leopold I. in Belgium. He died in the fall of 1896. His younger\r\nbrother lived in London where, for a period, he acted as a sort of\r\nmajor-domo in society, and but few entertainments were considered\r\ncomplete without him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDIPLOMATIC CORPS AND OTHER CELEBRITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the Count de Sartiges, who so ably represented\r\nthe French Government in the United States. He had not been very long in\r\nthis country when he married Miss Anna Thorndike of Boston, and while\r\nresiding in Washington they dispensed a lavish hospitality. Just before\r\nhe came to this country, the Count spent several years in Persia, which\r\nwas then regarded as an out-of-the-way post of duty. I recall quite an\r\namusing incident which occurred at an entertainment given by the\r\nCountess de Sartiges to which I was accompanied by George Newell,\r\nbrother-in-law of William L. Marcy. Mr. Newell had not been in\r\nWashington long enough to, become acquainted with all the members of the\r\nDiplomatic Corps, and, crossing the room to where I stood, he inquired:\r\n\"Who is the Aborigine who has been sitting next to me?\" I looked in the\r\ndirection indicated and recognized the well-known person of General Juan\r\nNepomuceno Almonte, the Mexican Minister, whose features strongly\r\nportrayed the Indian type. Some matrimonial alliances in Mexico at this\r\ntime, by the way, were more or less complicated; for example, General\r\nAlmonte's wife was his own niece.\r\n\r\nThe first Secretary of the French Legation was Baron Geoffrey Boilleau,\r\nwho remained in this country for several years. While stationed in\r\nWashington, he married Susan Benton, a daughter of Thomas H. Benton,\r\nU.S. Senator from Missouri and a political autocrat in his own State,\r\nanother of whose daughters, Jessie Ann, was the wife of General John C.\r\nFremont. At a later day, both Boilleau and Fremont became involved in\r\ndifficulties of a serious character in consequence of which the former,\r\nwhile Minister to Ecuador, was recalled to France, where, as I am\r\ninformed, he was convicted and confined for a period in the\r\n_Conciergerie_. I am not fully acquainted with the exact details of the\r\ncharges upon which he was tried, but they had their origin in the\r\nnegotiation of certain bonds of the proposed Memphis and El Paso\r\nRailroad. In my opinion, however, no one who knew Baron Boilleau well\r\never doubted his integrity. He was a man of decidedly literary tastes\r\nand, like many persons of that character, possessed but meager knowledge\r\nof business. It seems that General Fremont had obtained from the\r\nLegislature of Texas a grant of state lands in the interests of the\r\nrailroad just referred to, which was to be a portion of a projected\r\ntranscontinental line from Norfolk, Virginia, to San Diego and San\r\nFrancisco. It has been stated that \"the French agents employed to place\r\nthe land-grant bonds of this road on the market made the false\r\ndeclaration that they were guaranteed by the United States. In 1869 the\r\nSenate passed a bill giving Fremont's road the right of way through the\r\nterritories, an attempt to defeat it by fixing on him the onus of the\r\nmisstatement in Paris having been unsuccessful. In 1873 he was\r\nprosecuted by the French government for fraud in connection with this\r\nmisstatement. He did not appear in person, and was sentenced by default\r\nto fine and imprisonment, no judgment being given on the merits of the\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Louis de Bearn, Secretary of the French Legation, was a gentleman\r\nof most pleasing personality. He was a strikingly handsome bachelor at\r\nthe time I knew him and was much seen in the gay world. He was never\r\ncalled \"Prince\" in those days, but \"Count\"; but in a letter now before\r\nme, written in 1904 by his son, who was recently an attaché of the\r\nFrench Embassy in Washington, he claims that both his father and\r\ngrandfather were Princes by right of birth. He also states that the\r\ntitle was borne by his family before the Revolution of 1789. During his\r\nofficial life in Washington, Prince de Bearn married Miss Beatrice\r\nWinans, daughter of Ross Winans of Baltimore. Chevalier John George\r\nHulsemann, the Austrian Minister, was a convivial old bachelor and was\r\nmuch esteemed at the Capital for his genial qualities. He lived on F\r\nStreet, below Pennsylvania Avenue, and was stationed in Washington for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nChevalier Giuseppe Bertinatti, the Italian Minister, commenced his\r\ndiplomatic career in Washington as a bachelor. He did not occupy a house\r\nof his own, but lodged at the establishment of Mrs. Ulrich, which was\r\nthe headquarters of many foreigners. Fifty years ago and more, the\r\nmembers of the Diplomatic Corps, with few exceptions, lived either in\r\nmodest residences or in boarding houses, in striking contrast with many\r\nof the imposing mansions now occupied by the official representatives of\r\nforeign lands. His mission was a diplomatic success and while at the\r\ncapital he married Mrs. Eugénie Bass, a handsome widow from Mississippi,\r\nand soon departed upon another mission, taking his American bride with\r\nhim. Soon after the announcement of his prospective marriage, Count\r\nBertinatti issued invitations to a large dinner given in honor of his\r\n_fiancée_. When the gala day arrived, Mrs. Bass, though quite\r\nindisposed, was persuaded to be present at the dinner, but, feeling\r\ndecidedly ill, she retired from the table and in a short time became\r\nmuch nauseated. When this state of affairs was explained to General\r\nGeorge Douglas Ramsay, one of the guests of the evening, his quick sally\r\nwas, \"a Bass relief!\"\r\n\r\nBaron Frederick Charles Joseph von Gerolt, whom I knew very well and who\r\nrepresented King William of Prussia, is still affectionately recalled by\r\nhis few survivors who cling to early associations. His departure from\r\nWashington with his family was more deeply regretted than that of some\r\nother foreign residents whom I remember, as they had made many friends\r\nand had lived in Washington so long that they were regarded almost as\r\npermanent residents. The Misses Bertha and Dorothea von Gerolt were\r\ngraceful dancers and were very popular. Dorothea married into the\r\nDiplomatic Corps and accompanied her husband to Greece. I have heard\r\nthat Bertha became deeply attached to the Chevalier A. P. C. Van\r\nKarnabeek, secretary of the Netherlands Legation, but that, owing to\r\nreligious considerations, her parents frowned upon the alliance. She\r\naccordingly determined to enter upon a cloistered life and went to the\r\nGeorgetown convent where she became a nun, and was known until the day\r\nof her death in 1890 as \"Sister Angela.\" Baron von Gerolt was an\r\nintellectual man and, prior to his career in the United States, his name\r\nwas much associated with Baron Alexander von Humboldt; but as neither he\r\nnor Madame von Gerolt were proficient English scholars when they first\r\narrived they naturally depended upon others for instruction. I can vouch\r\nfor the truth of the statement that upon one occasion they were advised\r\nby members of his own legation to greet those whom they met with the\r\nwords, \"I'm damned glad to see you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Bergmans, Secretary of the Belgian Legation, married Lily\r\nMacalister, a Philadelphia heiress, who, in her widowhood, returned to\r\nthis country and made Washington her home. Madame Bergmans was a devotee\r\nto society and was particularly fond of dancing. She was a _petite\r\nblonde_, and, even after it ceased to be fashion, she wore her light\r\nhair down her back in many ringlets. When George M. Robeson, President\r\nGrant's Secretary of the Navy, saw her for the first time one evening\r\nwhile she was dancing, he exclaimed, \"That is the tripping of the light\r\nfantastic toe.\" She married quite late in life J. Scott Laughton, who\r\nwas considerably her junior, but did not long survive the alliance.\r\n\r\nMany members of the Diplomatic Corps of this period married American\r\nwomen. Baron Guido von Grabow, one of the secretaries of the Prussian\r\nLegation whom I knew very well, married Mrs. Edward Boyce, whose maiden\r\nname was Nina Wood. She was a granddaughter of President Zachary Taylor\r\nand was well known and beloved by old Washingtonians. Her marriage to\r\nBaron von Grabow offers strong encouragement to persistent suitors. He\r\nwas deeply in love with her prior to her first marriage, but she\r\nrejected him for Edward Boyce, who was a member of a prominent\r\nGeorgetown family. Mr. Boyce lived only a few years, and her subsequent\r\nmarried life with Baron von Grabow was long and happy.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Gau, _Chancelier_ of the Prussian Legation, married my younger\r\nsister, Margaret, who was regarded as a remarkable beauty as well as an\r\naccomplished linguist and pianist. Her wedding took place in our G\r\nStreet home in the same room where five months later her funeral\r\nservices were held. Mr. Gau did not long survive her and was interred by\r\nher side in my father's old burial plot in Jamaica, Long Island.\r\n\r\nDon Calderon de la Barca, the Spanish Minister to the United States,\r\ntogether with his wife, who was Miss Fanny Inglis, and her sister, Miss\r\nLydia Inglis, were presiding social spirits in Washington for many\r\nyears. The latter married a Mr. McLeod, and, becoming financially\r\nembarrassed, established on Staten Island a school for girls which was\r\nably conducted. These sisters were members of a Scotch family of\r\ndistinguished lineage. One of Mrs. McLeod's pupils was Mary E. Croghan,\r\na prominent heiress from Pittsburgh. She was still attending school on\r\nStaten Island when Captain Edward W. H. Schenley of the Royal Navy, a\r\nScotch relative of Mrs. McLeod, came to America to visit her. In\r\ninviting him to be her guest she felt that, as he was an elderly man,\r\nhe would prove to be quite immune to the attractions of mere school\r\ngirls. I met Captain Schenley about this same time in New York, and his\r\n\"make up\" was of such a remarkable character that it was a favorite _on\r\ndit_ that, when he was dressed for standing, a sitting posture was quite\r\nan impossibility. Young Miss Croghan must have discovered fascinations\r\nin this Scotchman as she eloped with him from Mrs. McLeod's school and\r\nafter a brief period accompanied him to England, where she spent the\r\nremainder of her life. Mrs. McLeod was severely criticised by her\r\npatrons for carelessness, and her school was somewhat injured by Miss\r\nCroghan's matrimonial adventure.\r\n\r\nDon Leopoldo Augusto De Cueto was another Spanish Minister, whom I\r\nregarded as an agreeable acquaintance. During his _régime_ filibustering\r\nagainst Spanish possessions, and especially Cuba, was a favorite pastime\r\nof American citizens and rendered the position of the Spanish Minister\r\nin Washington one of delicacy and difficulty. Residing in Washington\r\nduring De Cueto's tenure of office was a Cuban named Ambrosio José\r\nGonzales, who, in the Civil War, became Inspector General of Artillery\r\nin the Confederate Army, under General Beauregard. As he was well versed\r\nin music and had a remarkable voice, he frequently, upon request, sang\r\nselections from the popular operas then in vogue. Among the songs\r\nfrequently heard in drawing-rooms was \"Suoni la Tromba,\" from Bellini's\r\nopera \"I Puritani di Scozia,\" which had been interdicted by the Spanish\r\nGovernment. One evening when De Cueto was spending an informal evening\r\nwith my sisters and myself at our G Street home, Mr. Gonzales happened\r\nto call and was asked to sing. He seated himself at the piano and for\r\nsometime sang various airs for us. Finally, not knowing that \"Suoni la\r\nTromba\" was under the Spanish ban, I asked him to sing it. During the\r\nsong De Cueto was politely attentive, and at its conclusion had the\r\npoliteness to applaud it. Imagine, however, my surprise when I heard a\r\nfew days later, through a mutual friend, that Gonzales had boasted that\r\nhe sang the song in De Cueto's presence, proudly adding that he had\r\nlooked the Spaniard full in the eye when he uttered the word\r\n_libert[)a]_.\r\n\r\nMr. José de Marcoleta, the Nicaraguan Minister to the United States, was\r\nan elderly and punctilious Spaniard. He was indefatigable in the\r\nobservance of all social duties, and I met him wherever I went. He was a\r\nbachelor but, soon after his arrival in Washington, announced his\r\nengagement to Miss Mary West of Boston, who unfortunately died before\r\nher wedding day. I am under the impression that he eventually married\r\nanother American. I remember once when he called to see us I asked him\r\nto tell me something about Nicaragua, which was then an almost unknown\r\ncountry. My surprise can hardly be described when he told me he had\r\nnever seen the country which he represented, but was a native of Spain.\r\n\r\nBaron Waldemar Rudolph Raasloff represented Denmark in a manner\r\ncreditable both to his country and our own. He told me that some years\r\nprevious to his mission to America he came to New York in the capacity\r\nof an engineer and was engaged on work in New York harbor, \"blowing up\r\nrocks.\" Possibly he was thus employed at \"Hell Gate,\" at that time one\r\nof the most dangerous obstacles to navigation in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe well-known \"Octagon,\" as the old Tayloe home on the corner of New\r\nYork Avenue and Eighteenth Street is still called, during my early\r\nresidence in Washington was closed. Many superstitious persons regarded\r\nit with fear, as its reputation as a haunted house was then, in their\r\nopinion, well established. I have been told by the daughters of General\r\nGeorge D. Ramsay that upon one occasion their father was requested by\r\nColonel John Tayloe, the father of Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, to remain at\r\nthe Octagon over night, when he was obliged to be absent, as a\r\nprotection to his daughters, Anne and Virginia. While the members of the\r\nfamily were at the evening meal, the bells in the house began to ring\r\nviolently. General Ramsay immediately arose from the table to\r\ninvestigate, but failed to unravel the mystery. The butler, in a state\r\nof great alarm, rushed into the dining-room and declared that it was the\r\nwork of an unseen hand. As they continued to ring, General Ramsay held\r\nthe rope which controlled the bells, but, it is said, they were not\r\nsilenced. The architect of the Octagon was Dr. William Thornton, of the\r\nWest Indies, who designed the plans of the first capitol in Washington\r\nand who was the controlling spirit of the three Commissioners appointed\r\nby Congress to acquire a \"territory not exceeding ten miles square\" for\r\nthe establishment of a permanent seat of government. These men were\r\nDaniel Carroll, Thomas Johnson, first Governor of the State of Maryland,\r\nand David Stuart. Most of this land, which included Georgetown and\r\nAlexandria, was primeval forest and was owned chiefly by Daniel Carroll,\r\nNotley Young, Samuel Davidson and David Burns.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners had great difficulty in dealing with Burns, who owned\r\nnearly all of what is now the northwestern section of the city, as he\r\nwas a closefisted and hardheaded Scotchman, who was unwilling to part\r\nwith his lands without being roundly paid for them. When argument with\r\nhim proved fruitless, it is said that General Washington, realizing the\r\ngravity of the situation, rode up several times from Mount Vernon to\r\ndiscuss the situation with \"stubborn Mr. Burns.\" At length, in despair,\r\nhe remarked: \"Had not the Federal City been laid out here, you would\r\nhave died a poor planter.\" \"Ay, mon,\" was Burns's ready response, \"and\r\nhad you no married the widder Custis wi' a' her nagres ye'd ha'e been a\r\nland surveyor the noo', an' a mighty poor ane at that!\" It is further\r\nrelated that Washington finally succeeded in winning Burns over to his\r\nway of thinking, and that the canny Scotchman, realizing how largely he\r\nwas to profit by the transaction, actually became generous and gave to\r\nthe Commissioners, in fee simple, his apple orchard which is now the\r\nbeautiful Lafayette Square.\r\n\r\nIn passing through Lafayette Square, I have often sat down upon a bench\r\nto rest near the \"wishing tree,\" a dwarf chestnut so well known to\r\nresidents of the District, and I have been impressed by the many\r\nsuperstitious persons, both men and women, who have stopped for a moment\r\nand silently stood under its branches. Many are the credulous believers\r\nin its power to satisfy human desires, and the season when its branches\r\nare full of nuts is regarded by these as a specially propitious time for\r\ntheir realization. With many persons this tree is the basis of their\r\nonly superstition.\r\n\r\nI remember the case of a young girl who had been working very hard to\r\nobtain a position in one of the departments but without success and who,\r\nthoroughly discouraged, came to the tree early one morning and made the\r\nwish that to her and her family meant the actual necessities of life.\r\nShe then sat down to rest upon a near-by bench before going home, and\r\nwhile there became engaged in conversation with a pleasing looking\r\nwoman, to whom she poured forth her heart as she related her hopes and\r\ndisappointments about obtaining a government position. As her listener\r\nwas a sympathetic person, she asked the young woman her name and\r\naddress, and in a few days the poor girl received a notice to go to a\r\ncertain department for examination. It seems that her companion under\r\nthe tree was the wife of an influential Senator, who was so touched by\r\nthe young woman's efforts, as well as by her childish faith in the\r\n\"wishing tree,\" that she took pleasure in seeing that her great desire\r\nwas gratified.\r\n\r\nAt this time Washington was not far behind other large cities in games\r\nof chance, and gambling was frequently indulged in quite openly. Edward\r\nPendleton's resort, a luxurious establishment down town, was regarded as\r\nquite _à la mode_, and I have heard it said that he had able assistance\r\nfrom social ranks. I have often wondered why a man who indulged in this\r\nsport was called a gambler, as the term \"gamester,\" used many years ago,\r\nseems decidedly more appropriate. I own two volumes of a very old book,\r\npublished in the eighteenth century, entitled \"The Gamesters,\" in which\r\nthe heroes are professional gamblers. I have seen Mrs. Pendleton's\r\ncostly equipage, drawn by horses with brilliant trappings and followed\r\nby blooded hounds, coursing the length of Pennsylvania Avenue, while its\r\nowner seemed entirely unconscious of the aching hearts which had\r\ncontributed to all her grandeur. Cards were universally played in\r\nprivate homes and whist was the fashionable game, General Scott being\r\none of its chief devotees. I have often thought how much the old General\r\nwould have enjoyed \"bridge,\" as there was nothing that gave him more\r\npleasure than playing the \"dummy hand.\"\r\n\r\nMy old friend, Mrs. Diana Bullitt Kearny, the widow of General \"Phil\"\r\nKearny, in our many chats in her latter days, gave me many reminiscences\r\nof Washington at a time when I was not residing there. She described a\r\nfancy-dress ball given by her while residing in the old Porter house on\r\nH Street, which must have been about 1848, as General Kearny had just\r\nreturned from the Mexican War. She dwelt particularly upon the costume\r\nof Emma Meredith, one of her guests and the daughter of Jonathan\r\nMeredith of Baltimore, who came to Washington to attend the party. She\r\nrepresented a rainbow and her appearance was so gorgeous that Mrs.\r\nKearny said the Heavenly vision seemed almost within the grasp of common\r\nmortals. Miss Meredith's supremacy as a belle has never been eclipsed. I\r\nrecall a painful incident connected with her life. A young naval\r\nofficer was deeply in love with her and, it is said, was under the\r\nimpression that she intended to marry him. At a theater party one\r\nevening he discovered his mistake and, taking the affair to heart,\r\nreturned to his quarters and the same evening swallowed a dose of\r\ncorrosive sublimate. Physicians were immediately summoned and, although\r\nhe regretted the act and expressed a desire to live, they were unable to\r\nsave him. It is said that about the same time Miss Meredith left her\r\nhome in Baltimore to visit her sister, Mrs. Gardiner G. Howland, whose\r\nhusband was one of the merchant princes of New York, and that, as she\r\ncrossed the Jersey City Ferry, one of the first objects which met her\r\neyes was the funeral cortege of her disappointed lover _en route_ to his\r\nfinal resting place. Subsequent to this tragedy, I met Miss Meredith in\r\nSaratoga, surrounded by the usual admiring throng. She never married. I\r\nheard of her in recent years, at a summer resort near Baltimore, and,\r\nalthough advanced in years, I understood she still possessed exceptional\r\npowers of attraction. Only a short time ago I heard a young man remark\r\nthat he knew her very well and that he would rather converse with her\r\nthan with women many years her junior.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kearny was said to be the last of the \"Lafayette girls.\" In 1825,\r\nwhen Lafayette made his memorable visit to the United States as the\r\nguest of the nation, she was living with her parents in Louisville, and\r\nat the tender age of five strewed flowers in the pathway of the\r\ndistinguished Frenchman. She remembered the incident perfectly and in\r\nour numerous conversations I have repeatedly heard her allude to it. She\r\ntold me that, seated at General Lafayette's side in the carriage which\r\nconveyed him through the city, was the great-uncle, Colonel Richard C.\r\nAnderson, who led the advance of the American troops at the Battle of\r\nTrenton. General Robert Anderson, U.S.A., whose memory the country\r\nhonors as the defender of Fort Sumpter, was his son. The General's\r\nwidow, a daughter of General Duncan L. Clinch, U.S.A., resided in\r\nWashington until her death a few years ago. She was a woman of rare\r\nintelligence and, although a great invalid for many years, gathered\r\naround her an appreciative circle of friends, who were always charmed by\r\nher attractive personality.\r\n\r\nIn my earliest recollection of Washington the old Van Ness house was\r\nstill sheltered by many trees. The foliage was so dense that it may have\r\nbeen the desire of the occupants to shield themselves in this manner\r\nfrom public view. When I first knew the landmark it was occupied by\r\nThomas Green, an old-time resident of the District. He married, as his\r\nsecond wife, Ann Corbin Lomax, a daughter of Major Mann Page Lomax of\r\nthe Ordnance Department of the Army. During the Civil War, Mr. Green's\r\nsympathies were with the South, but he took no active part in the\r\nconflict. One of his idiosyncrasies was to pick up, on and around his\r\nspacious grounds, scraps of old iron, such as horse shoes, hay rakes and\r\nthe like, which were placed in a corner of his capacious cellar.\r\nSuspicion was centered upon his house by information given to the\r\ngovernment by an old family servant who thought he was doing the country\r\na service, and directions were accordingly given that it should be\r\nsearched. While this order was in process of execution, the discovery of\r\nthe scrap-iron is said to have played an important part and in some\r\nunaccountable manner to have aroused further suspicion. Whatever the\r\nlogic of the situation may have been is not intelligible, but the fact\r\nremains I that Mr. and Mrs. Green and the latter's sister, Miss Virginia\r\nLomax, were arrested in a summary manner and taken to the Old Capital\r\nPrison, where for a time they were kept in close confinement, during\r\nwhich Miss Lomax suffered severe indisposition and, as is said, never\r\nentirely recovered from the effects of her incarceration. About\r\ntwenty-five years after the War, while staying at the same house with\r\nher in Warrenton, Virginia, I quite longed to hear her reminiscences of\r\nprison life; but when I expressed my desire to a member of her family, I\r\nwas requested not to broach the subject as, even at this late day, it\r\nwas painful to her as a topic of conversation.\r\n\r\nDuring the War of 1812, Major Lomax was sent upon a mission to Canada by\r\nthe U.S. Government and, one day during his brief sojourn, dined in\r\ncompany with some British officers. During the dinner a toast was\r\noffered by one of the sons of John Bull: \"To President Madison, dead or\r\nalive.\" The responding toast by Major Lomax was: \"To the Prince Regent,\r\ndrunk or sober.\" The British officer who had proposed the toast to\r\nMadison immediately sprang to his feet and with much indignation\r\ninquired: \"Do you mean to insult me, sir?\" The quick rejoinder was: \"I\r\nam responding to an insult!\"\r\n\r\nI met Charles Sumner soon after his first appearance in the United\r\nStates Senate as the successor of Daniel Webster, who had become\r\nSecretary of State. He was a man of striking appearance and bore himself\r\nwith the dignity so characteristic of the statesmen of that period.\r\n\"Sumner is one of them literary fellows,\" was the facetious criticism of\r\nthe Hon. Zachariah Chandler of Michigan, who a few years later became\r\none of his colleagues in the Senate, and who in earlier life was\r\naccumulating a large fortune while Mr. Sumner, in his Massachusetts\r\nhome, was engaged in those intellectual and scholarly pursuits which\r\neventually made him one of the ripest and most accomplished students in\r\nthe land. Chandler, however, in his own way, furnished a conspicuous\r\nexample to aspiring youths of the day, both by his earlier and\r\nsubsequent life, of what may be accomplished by determined application.\r\n\r\nFor a decade or more preceding the Civil War the political sentiment of\r\nWashington, especially in reference to the violent anti-slavery\r\nagitation then engrossing the thought of the country, was decidedly in\r\nsympathy with the attitude of the South. It is not, therefore,\r\nsurprising that Sumner, whose radical views were known from Maine to\r\nTexas, should have been received at first in Washington society with but\r\nlittle cordiality. As the years passed along, he was rapidly forging\r\nhimself ahead to the leadership of his party in the Senate and, of\r\ncourse, became strongly inimical to Buchanan's administration. He was\r\nregarded with confidence and esteem by his own party, and, although\r\nnaturally both disliked and feared by his political opponents, it could\r\nbe truthfully said of him that he was\r\n\r\n    A man that fortune's buffets and rewards\r\n    Hast ta'en with equal thanks,\r\n\r\nand that no attempts to socially ostracize or to deride him for his\r\npolitical views and his intense application to his sense of duty\r\ndeterred the great Massachusetts statesman from pursuing the \"even tenor\r\nof his way.\"\r\n\r\nAn anecdote went the rounds of the Capital to the effect that, one\r\nmorning when a gentleman called to see Sumner at his rooms on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, a colored attendant answered the door and after\r\nglancing at his card informed him that it would be impossible to disturb\r\nhis master, as he was rehearsing before a looking-glass a speech which\r\nhe expected to deliver the following morning. Whether this was\r\noriginally told by a friend or foe of Mr. Sumner is not known. Mr.\r\nSumner once requested me to take him to see a young Washington belle who\r\ncombined Parisian grace with Kentucky dash. I refer to Miss Sally\r\nStrother, an acknowledged beauty of decidedly Southern views, who lived\r\non Seventh Street near F Street, now a commercial center. Mr. Sumner and\r\nI walked to her house from my home on G Street and found several guests\r\nin her drawing-room, where the topic of conversation, in the course of\r\nthe evening, drifted to the subject of spiritualism. It was announced\r\nthat at a recent _séance_ the spirit of Washington had appeared and\r\nuttered the usual platitudes, whereupon Miss Strother, without a\r\nmoment's hesitation, remarked: \"I wonder what General Washington would\r\nsay about Mr. Sumner?\" Someone undertook to define Washington's views,\r\nbut Miss Strother interrupted and said: \"I know just what he would\r\nsay--that he was a very intelligent, a very handsome, but a very bad\r\nman.\" This remark was naturally productive of much mirth, but failed to\r\narouse any manifestation of feeling or disapprobation on the part of Mr.\r\nSumner. Later, as we were walking homeward he remarked: \"I have\r\n_l'esprit d'escalier_ and my retorts do not come until I am well-nigh\r\ndown the flight of stairs.\" Sally Strother went abroad, where she\r\nmarried Baron Fahnenberg of Belgium, and shared a fate similar to that\r\nof many of her country-women, as she was finally separated from her\r\nhusband. She cherished, however, a pride of title and bequeathed $60,000\r\nto erect in Spa, Belgium, a handsome chapel as well as a vault to\r\ncontain the remains of her mother, brother and herself. Her Kentucky\r\nrelatives, however, including the family of Mrs. Basil Duke, succeeded\r\nin breaking the will on the ground that her mother's will, through which\r\nshe had inherited her property, did not permit it to leave the family.\r\nThe chapel and vault, accordingly, were not built, and all her property\r\nreverted to her relatives.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his commanding presence, nature bestowed upon Mr. Sumner\r\na clear and melodious voice, which rendered it quite unnecessary for him\r\nto resort to Demosthenic methods of cultivation. For many years his\r\ninspiring words could be heard upon the floor of the Senate in all of\r\nthe leading debates of the day, and his masterly orations will go down\r\nto posterity as an important contribution to the history of many\r\nnational administrations.\r\n\r\nI well remember Preston S. Brooks's cowardly assault upon Charles Sumner\r\nin the Senate Chamber in the spring of 1856. Public indignation ran very\r\nhigh, and his political opponents referred to him thereafter as \"Bully\r\nBrooks.\" Socially, as well as politically, he was popular. He possessed\r\na gentle and pleasing bearing and it would have been difficult for\r\nanyone to associate him with such a cruel outrage. His uncle, Andrew P.\r\nButler, who was in the U.S. Senate from South Carolina at the same time,\r\nwas a fine-looking and venerable gentleman, but he was one of the class\r\nthen designated as \"fire-eaters.\"\r\n\r\nThere existed between Mr. Sumner and Henry W. Longfellow a strong\r\nfriendship which was contracted in early life. I have often heard the\r\nMassachusetts statesman recite some of his friend's poetical lines,\r\nwhich seemed to me additionally beautiful when rendered in his deep and\r\nsonorous voice. In the latter years of his life he resided in the house\r\nwhich is now the Arlington Hotel Annex, where he surrounded himself with\r\nhis remarkable collection of books and articles of _virtu_ which he\r\nexhibited with pride to his guests. I especially recall an old clock\r\npresented to him by Henry Sanford, Minister to Belgium, as an artistic\r\nwork of exceptional beauty. Mr. Sumner, by the way, was an accomplished\r\nconnoisseur in art. I have heard him strongly denounce Clark Mills's\r\nequestrian statue of General Andrew Jackson, now standing in the center\r\nof Lafayette Square. He told me that on one occasion he was conducting a\r\nparty of Englishmen through the streets of the National Capital and, as\r\nthey were driving along Pennsylvania Avenue, he seated himself in such a\r\nposition as to entirely obstruct the view of what he called this\r\n\"grotesque statue,\" calling the attention of his guests, meanwhile, to\r\nthe White House on the other side of the street.\r\n\r\nI felt honored in calling Charles Sumner my friend, and I take especial\r\npleasure in repeating the encomium that \"to the wisdom of the statesman\r\nand the learning of the scholar he joined the consecration of a patriot,\r\nthe honor of a knight and the sincerity of a Christian.\" George Sumner,\r\nhis brother, did not appear in the land of his birth as a celebrity, but\r\nhe had a remarkable career abroad. He hobnobbed with royalty throughout\r\nthe European continent and was highly regarded for his profound\r\nlearning. He studied at the Universities of Heidelberg and Berlin and\r\ntraveled extensively through Europe, Asia and Africa. He never tarried\r\nlong in his \"native heath,\" and furnished conspicuous evidence that \"a\r\nprophet is not without honor save in his own country.\" Alexander von\r\nHumboldt praised the accuracy of his researches and Alexis de\r\nTocqueville referred to him as being better acquainted with European\r\npolitics than any European with whom he was acquainted.\r\n\r\nWhile Sumner was in the Senate, George T. Davis of Greenfield,\r\nMassachusetts, was a member of the House of Representatives. I knew him\r\nvery well and he was a constant visitor at our home. He was celebrated\r\nfor his flashes of wit, which sometimes stimulated undeveloped powers in\r\nothers, and I have often seen dull perceptions considerably sharpened at\r\nhis approach. Oliver Wendell Holmes speaks of his witty sayings in the\r\n\"Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,\" and his conversational powers were so\r\nbrilliant that they won the admiration of Thackeray. Robert Rantoul,\r\nalso from Massachusetts, and a colleague of Davis, was a \"Webster Whig\"\r\nand a powerful exponent of the \"Free-Soil\" faith. Davis, who was so\r\nbright and clever in the drawing-room, could not, however, compete with\r\nRantoul on the floor of the House in parliamentary debate. The epitaph\r\non Rantoul's monument says that \"He died at his post in Congress, and\r\nhis last words were a protest in the name of Democracy against the\r\nFugitive-Slave Law.\" One of the verses of Whittier's poem, entitled\r\n\"Rantoul,\" reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Through him we hoped to speak the word\r\n      Which wins the freedom of a land;\r\n    And lift, for human right, the sword\r\n      Which dropped from Hampden's dying hand.\r\n\r\nI first met the eccentric Count Adam Gurowski at the convivial tea table\r\nof Miss Emily Harper in Newport, upon one of those balmy summer evenings\r\nso indelibly impressed upon my memory. He was, perhaps, in many\r\nrespects, one of the most remarkable characters that Washington has ever\r\nknown. He was a son of Count Ladislas Gurowski, an ardent admirer of\r\nKosciusko, and was active in revolutionary projects in Poland in\r\nconsequence of which he was condemned to death by the Russian\r\nauthorities. He managed, however, to escape and in 1835 published a work\r\nentitled \"La Verité sur la Russie,\" in which he advocated a union of the\r\nvarious branches of the Slavic race. This book was so favorably regarded\r\nin Russia that its author was recalled and employed in the civil\r\nservice. He came to this country in 1849, and, after being employed on\r\nthe staff of _The New York Tribune_, came to Washington, where his\r\nlinguistic attainments and the aid of Charles Sumner secured for him a\r\nposition as translator in the State Department, which he held from 1861\r\nto 1863.\r\n\r\nThe Count was a medley of strange whims and idiosyncrasies that almost\r\nbaffle description. Together with his strong individuality, he possessed\r\na trait which made many enemies and ultimately proved his undoing. I\r\nrefer to his uncontrollable desire to contradict and to antagonize. It\r\nwas simply impossible to find a subject upon which he and anyone else\r\ncould agree. There were, however, extenuating circumstances. \"Chill\r\npenury,\" forced upon him by the state of his financial affairs, had much\r\nto do with his cynical and acrimonious spirit. Prosperity is certainly\r\nconducive to an amiable bearing, and I believe that Gurowski would have\r\nbeen more conciliatory if adversity had not so persistently attended\r\nhis pathway. It is highly probable, too, that Gurowski would have\r\nretained his position under the government indefinitely but for his\r\nunfortunate disposition. He wrote a diary from 1861 to 1863 which he was\r\nso indiscreet as to keep in his desk in the State Department; and,\r\nunknown at first to him, some of its pages were brought to the attention\r\nof certain officials of the government. They contained anything but\r\ncomplimentary references to his chief, William H. Seward, Secretary of\r\nState, and he was discharged. Meanwhile he had antagonized his\r\nbenefactor, Mr. Sumner, by opposing, in a caustic manner, his views in\r\nreference to the conduct of the Civil War, and by other similar\r\nindiscretions was making new enemies almost every day.\r\n\r\nThe intense bitterness and intemperance of Gurowski in the expression of\r\nhis views is well illustrated in a conversation quoted by one of his\r\nfriends in _The Atlantic Monthly_ more than forty years ago. It had\r\nreference to a period preceding the Civil War when the \"Fugitive-Slave\r\nLaw\" was engrossing the attention of the country. \"What do I care for\r\nMr. Webster,\" he said. \"I can read the Constitution as well as Mr.\r\nWebster.\" \"But surely, Count, you would not presume to dispute Mr.\r\nWebster's opinion on a question of constitutional law?\" \"And why not? I\r\ntell you I can read the Constitution as well as Mr. Webster, and I say\r\nthat the 'Fugitive-Slave Law' is unconstitutional--is an outrage, and an\r\nimposition of which you will all soon be ashamed. It is a disgrace to\r\nyour humanity and to your republicanism, and Mr. Webster should be hung\r\nfor advocating it. He is a humbug or an ass--an ass, if he believes such\r\nan infamous law to be constitutional, and if he does not believe it, he\r\nis a humbug and a scoundrel for advocating it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count's sarcastic reference to Secretary Seward is equally amusing.\r\nIt seems that one of his duties, while in the State Department, was to\r\nkeep a close watch upon the European newspapers for matters of interest\r\nto our government, and also to furnish the Secretary of State, when\r\nrequested, with opinions on diplomatic questions, or, as Gurowski\r\nexpressed it, \"to read the German newspapers and keep Seward from making\r\na fool of himself.\" The first duty, he said, was easy enough, but the\r\nlatter was rather difficult!\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Gurowski published his book, \"Russia as it is,\" which was soon\r\nfollowed by another work entitled, \"America and Europe.\" Both of them\r\nmet with a favorable reception, but, after losing his government\r\nposition, it became a difficult matter for him to eke out a maintenance,\r\nand his disposition, if possible, became still more embittered. At an\r\nevening party I took part by chance in an animated discussion upon the\r\nsubject of dueling. Suddenly my eye lighted upon Count Gurowski, who had\r\njust entered the room. Calling him to my side I asked him in facetious\r\ntones how many men he had killed. He quickly responded, \"Wonly (only)\r\ntwo!\"\r\n\r\nCount Gurowski's fund of knowledge was in many ways highly remarkable,\r\nespecially upon his favorite theme of royalty and nobility, past and\r\npresent. He was intensely disliked by the Diplomatic Corps in\r\nWashington, many of whose members regarded him as a Russian spy, a\r\nsuspicion which, of course, was without the slightest foundation. Baron\r\nWaldemar Rudolph Raasloff, the Danish Minister, once refused to enter a\r\nbox at the opera where I was seated because Gurowski was one of the\r\nparty. The Count seemed to be in touch with sources of information\r\nrelating to diplomats and their affairs which were unknown to others--a\r\nfact which naturally aroused dislike and jealousy. He once announced to\r\nme, for example, that the _attachés_ of the French Legation were in a\r\nstate of great good humor, as their salaries had been raised that day.\r\nI once heard a member of a foreign legation say to another: \"Gurowski is\r\nan emanation of the Devil.\" \"The Devil, you say,\" was the response,\r\n\"why, he is the Devil himself.\" In discussing with a foreigner the\r\nCount's exile by the Russian government, I said that I knew of relatives\r\nof his in high position in Russia. Evidently controlled by his\r\nprejudices, he replied: \"It must be a family of contrasts, as his\r\nposition in this country is certainly a low one.\" If he intended to\r\nconvey the impression that the Count was \"low\" in his pocket, his\r\nstatement was certainly correct, but not otherwise. It is true that his\r\nunhappy disposition made him more enemies than friends, but he was by no\r\nmeans devoid of admirable traits, even if he so frequently preferred to\r\nconceal them. The finer side of his nature and his pleasing qualities\r\nonly were presented to my sister, Mrs. Eames, who always welcomed him to\r\nher house. One day when he called the condition of his health seemed so\r\nprecarious that she insisted upon his becoming her guest. He accepted\r\nthe invitation, but did not long survive, and in the spring of 1866 his\r\nturbulent spirit passed away while under my sister's roof. Much respect\r\nwas paid to his memory and the most distinguished men and women in\r\nWashington attended his funeral. He is buried in the Congressional\r\nCemetery, where a crested tablet surmounts his grave. Little was\r\ngenerally known of his immediate family relations, but Robert Carter,\r\none of his most intimate friends and the author of the article in _The\r\nAtlantic Monthly_, already referred to, states that he was a widower and\r\nhad a son in the Russian Navy and a married daughter in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nEarly in life his brother, Count Ignatius Gurowski, met the Infanta\r\nIsabella de Bourbon, sister of the Prince Consort of Spain, while she\r\nwas receiving her education at the _Sacre Coeur_ in Paris, and eloped\r\nwith her. They were pensioned by the Spanish government for a while\r\nunder Queen Isabella's reign and made their home in Brussels. I have\r\nheard, however, that when Isabella was forced from the throne the\r\npension ceased and their circumstances became quite reduced. It is said\r\nthat the Prince Consort, Ignatius Gurowski's brother-in-law, suggested\r\nto him soon after his marriage that it might be well for him to be\r\ncreated a Duke of the realm. This friendly offer was declined with\r\nindignation. \"I would prefer,\" said Gurowski, \"being an old Count to a\r\nnew Duke!\"\r\n\r\nSometime ago I saw the statement in a newspaper to the effect that\r\ndescendants of Ignatius Gurowski were living in the United States. This\r\nsuggests, although remotely, the inquiry heard many years ago: \"Have we\r\na Bourbon among us?\"--referring, of course, to the last Dauphin, whom\r\nmany believed to exist in the person of the Rev. Eleazer Williams, who\r\nresided in St. Lawrence County, New York. The Rev. Dr. Francis L. Hawks\r\nhad such an abiding faith that Williams was actually the Dauphin that he\r\nwrote an article in 1853 for _Putnam's Magazine_ expressive of his\r\nviews. If the newspaper story and Dr. Hawks's claims be true, this\r\ncountry has accordingly been the retreat of more than one member of the\r\nill-fated Bourbon family. Several years ago I was surprised to hear it\r\nstated that the father of Kuroki, the famous Japanese General, was a\r\nbrother of Adam and Ignatius Gurowski. This information, I am informed,\r\ncame from a nephew of General Kuroki who was receiving his education in\r\nEurope. \"My uncle Kuroki,\" he is said to have written, \"is of Polish\r\norigin. His father was a Polish nobleman by the name of Kourowski, who\r\nfled from Russia after the Revolution of 1831. He finally went to Japan\r\nand married a Japanese. As the name of Kourowski is difficult to\r\npronounce in Japanese, my uncle pronounced it Kuroki. The General's\r\nfather, upon his death bed said to him that perhaps some day he would\r\nbe able to take vengeance upon the Russians for their cruel treatment of\r\nunhappy Poland.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable men of my acquaintance in Washington was Caleb\r\nCushing. I first met him when he was Attorney-General in President\r\nPierce's Cabinet, and the friendship formed at that time lasted for many\r\nyears. He was among the guests at my wedding, and Miss Emily Harper,\r\nwhom he accompanied, told me that he especially commented upon that\r\nportion of the service which reads, \"those whom God hath joined\r\ntogether, let no man put asunder.\" His remarks evidently appealed to her\r\nas an ardent Roman Catholic. Ralph Waldo Emerson declared Mr. Cushing to\r\nbe the most eminent scholar of the country, and Wendell Phillips went\r\nstill further and said: \"I regard Mr. Cushing as the most learned man\r\nliving.\" His habit was one of constant acquirement. He was what I should\r\ncall \"a Northern man with Southern principles,\" an expression which\r\noriginated in 1835, and was first applied to Martin Van Buren. I have\r\nheard Cushing defend slavery with great eloquence and although, like\r\nhim, I was born and bred in the North, I regarded that institution, in\r\nsome respects, as far less iniquitous than the infamous opium trade\r\nwhich so enriched British and American merchants, and of which I saw so\r\nmuch during my life in China.\r\n\r\nIt must have been from his Pilgrim forefather that Mr. Cushing inherited\r\na decided antipathy for Great Britain, and it was once said that he\r\ncarried this prejudice so far that he refused to visit England. This\r\nstatement, however, is untrue, as I have before me an amusing article,\r\nwritten many years ago by his private secretary, during his mission to\r\nSpain, which contradicts it. He gives some amusing incidents connected\r\nwith his visit of a few days in London when he and Mr. Cushing were _en\r\nroute_ to Spain. \"Mr. Cushing's headwear,\" he writes, \"was a silk hat\r\nwhich must have been the fashion of about the time he discarded\r\numbrellas. It was slightly pointed at the top and there was, so to say,\r\nno back or front to it and there was no band for it. As I knew he\r\nintended paying several visits, I asked him if he would not exchange his\r\nhat, which at the time was thoroughly soaked, for a new and lighter one.\r\nThe old man took off his ancient hat, examined it critically and then\r\nsaid slowly and deliberately, as if delivering an opinion on the bench,\r\n'No, sir, I think that I shall wait and see what the fashions are in\r\nMadrid.' It was said with much earnestness, as if it had been a state\r\nquestion. A third person would have found it irresistibly funny, but\r\nthere was nothing laughable in it to General Cushing. In fact, his sense\r\nof humor was of a very grim order.\" He also writes: \"The old man was an\r\ninveterate smoker, and yet, during the whole period of my intercourse\r\nwith him, I did not see him light a score of fresh cigars. He bought\r\nthem, that is certain, but he must have been averse to lighting them in\r\npublic for he almost invariably had a stump between his lips. Ask him if\r\nhe would have a cigar and the answer would be, 'Thank you, sir, I think\r\nI have one,' and out would come a dilapidated case, from which he would\r\nshake from one to half a dozen butts as the supply ran.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Cushing was Attorney-General under President Pierce, he formed a\r\nfriendship with Madame Calderon de la Barca, of whom I have already\r\nspoken, who, upon his arrival in Madrid, was one of the first persons to\r\ngreet him. She was then a widow and occupied a high social position at\r\nthe Spanish court. Cushing and she thoroughly enjoyed the renewal of\r\ntheir earlier friendship in Washington, and the last visit he made in\r\nMadrid was when he bade her a final farewell. In 1843, and prior to his\r\nmission to Spain, Mr. Cushing was appointed by President Tyler Minister\r\nto China, where his able diplomacy has been the subject of recognition\r\nand admiration to this day. He carried with him the following\r\nremarkable letter which he was charged by the President to deliver in\r\nperson to the Emperor. It may have been--who knows?--the first lesson in\r\noccidental geography submitted to the \"Brother of the Sun and the Sister\r\nof the Moon and Stars.\" Had the President of the United States been\r\ncalled upon to address a country Sunday School, he could hardly have\r\nexhibited a more conscious effort to adapt himself to the level of his\r\nhearers. This is the letter:--\r\n\r\n     I, John Tyler, President of the United States of\r\n     America--which states are Maine, New Hampshire,\r\n     Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New York,\r\n     New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,\r\n     North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky,\r\n     Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana, Mississippi, Illinois,\r\n     Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas and Michigan--send this letter\r\n     of peace and friendship, signed by my own hand.\r\n\r\n     I hope your health is good. China is a great empire,\r\n     extending over a great part of the world. The Chinese are\r\n     numerous. You have millions and millions of subjects. The\r\n     twenty-six United States are as large as China, though our\r\n     people are not so numerous. The rising sun looks upon the\r\n     great mountains and great rivers of China. When he sets he\r\n     looks upon mountains and rivers equally large in the United\r\n     States. Our territories extend from one great ocean to the\r\n     other; and on the west we are divided only from your domain\r\n     by the sea. Leaving the mouth of one of our great rivers and\r\n     going constantly towards the setting sun we sail to Japan\r\n     and the Yellow Sea.\r\n\r\n     Now, my words are that the governments of two such great\r\n     countries should be at peace. It is proper and according to\r\n     the will of heaven that they should respect each other and\r\n     act wisely. I therefore send to your Court Caleb Cushing one\r\n     of the wise and learned men of this country. On his first\r\n     arrival in China he will inquire for your health. He has\r\n     strict orders to go to your great city of Pekin and there\r\n     to deliver this letter. He will have with him secretaries\r\n     and interpreters.\r\n\r\n     The Chinese love to trade with our people and sell them tea\r\n     and silk for which our people pay silver and sometimes other\r\n     articles. But if the Chinese and Americans will trade there\r\n     should be rules so that they shall not break your laws or\r\n     our laws. Our minister, Caleb Cushing, is authorized to make\r\n     a treaty to regulate trade. Let it be just. Let there be no\r\n     unfair advantage on either side. Let the people trade not\r\n     only at Canton, but also at Amoy, Ningpo, Shanghai, Fushan\r\n     and all such other places as may offer profitable exchanges\r\n     both to China and the United States, provided they do not\r\n     break your laws or our laws. We shall not take the part of\r\n     the evil doers. We shall not uphold them that break your\r\n     laws. Therefore we doubt that you will be pleased that our\r\n     messenger of peace, with this letter in hand, shall come to\r\n     Pekin and there deliver it, and that your great officers\r\n     will, by your order, make a treaty with him to regulate the\r\n     affairs of trade, so that nothing may happen to disturb the\r\n     peace between China and America. Let the treaty be signed by\r\n     your own imperial hand. It shall be signed by mine, by the\r\n     authority of the great council, the Senate.\r\n\r\n     And so may your health be good and may peace reign.\r\n\r\n     Written at Washington this twelfth day of July, in the year\r\n     of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-three.\r\n\r\n          Your good friend,\r\n\r\n               JOHN TYLER,\r\n               President.\r\n\r\nMr. Cushing accordingly negotiated our first treaty with China on the 3d\r\nof July of the following year, and his ability at that time, as well as\r\nthereafter, won for him, irrespective of party affiliations, an enviable\r\nplace in the history of American diplomacy. He was sent upon his mission\r\nto Spain in 1874 by the party which he had opposed from its first\r\norganization, and his diplomatic erudition was indispensable to the\r\nState Department during the Grant administration.\r\n\r\nCertain events in the career of Mr. Cushing serve to recall the days of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Franklin Pierce, whose lives were clouded by a grief that\r\nsaddened the whole of their subsequent career. A short time before\r\nPierce's inauguration, the President-elect with Mrs. Pierce and their\r\nonly son, a lad of immature years, were on their way to Andover in\r\nMassachusetts, when the child was accidentally killed. Mrs. Pierce never\r\ncould be diverted from her all-absorbing sorrow, and I shall always\r\nremember the grief-stricken expression of this first Lady of the Land.\r\nHer maiden name was Jane Means Appleton, and she was the daughter of the\r\nRev. Dr. Jesse Appleton, President of Bowdoin College. During the Pierce\r\nadministration, Judge John Cadwalader, the father of the present John\r\nCadwalader of Philadelphia, was a member of Congress. The son was then a\r\nmere lad, but he bore such a strong resemblance to the President's son\r\nthat one day when Mrs. Pierce met him she was completely overcome. After\r\nthis boy had become a man and had attained exceptional eminence at the\r\nbar, he feelingly alluded to this touching incident of his earlier days.\r\n\r\nI was very intimately acquainted with Elizabeth and Fanny MacNeil,\r\nPresident Pierce's nieces, who were occasional visitors at the White\r\nHouse. They were daughters of General John MacNeil, U.S.A., who had\r\nacquitted himself with distinction in the War of 1812. Elizabeth\r\nmarried, as before stated, General Henry W. Benham of the Engineer Corps\r\nof the Army, and Fanny became the wife of Colonel Chandler E. Potter,\r\nU.S.A. Dr. Thomas Miller was our family physician for many years. He\r\ncame to Washington from Loudoun County, Virginia, and married Miss\r\nVirginia Collins Jones, daughter of Walter Jones, an eminent lawyer.\r\nDuring the Pierce administration he was physician to the President's\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND CONTINUED LIFE IN WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\nI met my future father-in-law, Samuel L. Gouverneur, Sr., for the first\r\ntime in Cold Spring, New York. Mr. Gouverneur, accompanied by his second\r\nwife, then a bride, who was Miss Mary Digges Lee, of Needwood, Frederick\r\nCounty, Maryland, and a granddaughter of Thomas Sim Lee, second Governor\r\nof the same state, was the guest of Gouverneur Kemble. When I first knew\r\nMr. Gouverneur he possessed every gift that fortune as well as nature\r\ncan bestow. To quote the words of Eliab Kingman, a lifelong friend of\r\nhis and who for many years was the Nestor of the Washington press, \"he\r\neven possessed a seductive voice.\" General Scott, prior to my marriage\r\ninto the family, remarked to me that there \"was something in Mr.\r\nGouverneur lacking of greatness.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of my husband's family is so well known that it seems almost\r\nsuperfluous to dwell upon it, but, as these reminiscences are purely\r\npersonal, I may at least incidentally refer to it. Samuel L. Gouverneur,\r\nSr., was the youngest child of Nicholas Gouverneur and his wife, Hester\r\nKortright, a daughter of Lawrence Kortright, a prominent merchant of New\r\nYork and at one time president of its Chamber of Commerce. He was\r\ngraduated from Columbia College in New York in the class of 1817, and\r\nmarried his first cousin, Maria Hester Monroe, the younger daughter of\r\nJames Monroe. This wedding took place in the East Room of the White\r\nHouse. My husband, Samuel L. Gouverneur, Jr., was the youngest child of\r\nthis alliance. _The National Intelligencer_ of March 11, 1820, contained\r\nthe following brief marriage notice:\r\n\r\n     _Married_\r\n\r\n     On Thursday evening last [March 9th], in this City, by the\r\n     Reverend Mr. [William] Hawley, Samuel Laurence Gouverneur,\r\n     Esq., of New York, to Miss Maria Hester Monroe, youngest\r\n     daughter of James Monroe, President of the United States.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years Samuel L. Gouverneur, Sr., was private secretary\r\nto his father-in-law, President Monroe. In 1825 he was a member of the\r\nNew York Legislature, and from 1828 to 1836 Postmaster of the City of\r\nNew York. For many years, like the gentlemen of his day and class, he\r\nwas much interested in racehorses and at one time owned the famous\r\nhorse, _Post Boy_. He was also deeply interested in the drama and it was\r\npartially through his efforts that many brilliant stars were brought to\r\nthis country to perform at the Bowery Theater in New York, of which he\r\nwas a partial owner. Among its other owners were Prosper M. Wetmore, the\r\nwell-known author and regent of the University of the State of New York,\r\nand General James A. Hamilton, son of Alexander Hamilton and acting\r\nSecretary of State in 1829, under Jackson. Mr. Gouverneur was a man of\r\ndecidedly social tastes and at one period of his life owned and occupied\r\nthe De Menou buildings on H Street in Washington, where, during the life\r\nof his first wife, he gave some brilliant entertainments. It was from\r\nthis house that his son, and my future husband, went to the Mexican War.\r\nMany years subsequent to my marriage I heard Rear Admiral John J. Almy,\r\nU.S.N., describe some of the entertainments given by the Gouverneur\r\nfamily, and he usually wound up his reminiscences by informing me that\r\nsixteen baskets of champagne were frequently consumed by the guests\r\nduring a single evening. My old friend, Emily Mason, loved to refer to\r\nthese parties and told me that she made her _début_ at one of them. The\r\nhouse was well adapted for entertainments, as there were four spacious\r\ndrawing-rooms, two on each side of a long hall, one side being reserved\r\nfor dancing.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Gouverneur-Monroe wedding the bride was but sixteen\r\nyears of age, and many years younger than her only sister, Eliza, who\r\nwas the wife of Judge George Hay of Virginia, the United States\r\nDistrict-Attorney of that State, and the prosecuting officer at the\r\ntrial of Aaron Burr. Mrs. Hay was educated in Paris at Madame Campan's\r\ncelebrated school, where she was the associate and friend of Hortense de\r\nBeauharnais, subsequently the Queen of Holland and the mother of\r\nNapoleon III. The Rev. Dr. William Hawley, who performed the marriage\r\nceremony of Miss Monroe and Mr. Gouverneur, was the rector of old St.\r\nJohn's Church in Washington. He was a gentleman of the old school and\r\nalways wore knee breeches and shoe buckles. In the War of 1812 he\r\ncommanded a company of divinity students in New York, enlisted for the\r\nprotection of the city. It is said that when ordered to the frontier he\r\nrefused to go and resigned his commission, and I have heard that\r\nCommodore Stephen Decatur refused to attend St. John's Church during his\r\nrectorship, because he said he did not care to listen to a man who\r\nrefused to obey orders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. JAMES MONROE, NÉE KORTRIGHT, BY BENJAMIN WEST.\r\n\r\n_Original portrait owned by Mrs. Gouverneur._]\r\n\r\nOnly the relatives and personal friends attended the Gouverneur-Monroe\r\nwedding at the White House; even the members of the Cabinet were not\r\ninvited. The gallant General Thomas S. Jesup, one of the heroes of the\r\nWar of 1812 and Subsistance Commissary General of the Army, acted as\r\ngroomsman to Mr. Gouverneur. Two of his daughters, Mrs. James Blair and\r\nMrs. Augustus S. Nicholson, still reside at the National Capital and are\r\nprominent \"old Washingtonians.\" After this quiet wedding, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGouverneur left Washington upon a bridal tour and about a week later\r\nreturned to the White House, where, at a reception, Mrs. Monroe gave up\r\nher place as hostess to mingle with her guests, while Mrs. Gouverneur\r\nreceived in her place. Commodore and Mrs. Stephen Decatur, who lived on\r\nLafayette Square, gave the bride her first ball, and two mornings later,\r\non the twenty-second of March, 1820, Decatur fought his fatal duel with\r\nCommodore James Barron and was brought home a corpse. \"The bridal\r\nfestivities,\" wrote Mrs. William Winston Seaton, wife of the editor of\r\n_The National Intelligencer_, \"have received a check which will prevent\r\nany further attentions to the President's family, in the murder of\r\nDecatur.\" The invitations already sent out for an entertainment in honor\r\nof the bride and groom by Commodore David Porter, father of the late\r\nAdmiral David D. Porter, U.S.N., were immediately countermanded.\r\n\r\nI never had the pleasure of knowing my mother-in-law, Mrs. Maria Hester\r\nMonroe Gouverneur, as she died some years before my marriage, but I\r\nlearned to revere her through her son, whose tender regard for her was\r\none of the absorbing affections of his life and changed the whole\r\ndirection of his career. At an early age he was appointed a Lieutenant\r\nin the regular Army and served with distinction through the Mexican War\r\nin the Fourth Artillery. On one occasion subsequent to that conflict,\r\nwhile his mother was suffering from a protracted illness, he applied to\r\nthe War Department for leave of absence in order that he might visit her\r\nsick bed; and when it was not granted he resigned his commission and\r\nthus sacrificed an enviable position to his sense of filial duty. Many\r\nyears later, after my husband's decease, in looking over his papers I\r\nfound these lines written by him just after his mother's death:--\r\n\r\n\"A man through life has but _one_ true friend and that friend generally\r\nleaves him early. Man enters the lists of life but ere he has fought his\r\nway far that friend falls by his side; he never finds another so fond,\r\nso true, so faithful to the last--_His Mother_!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gouverneur was somewhat literary in her tastes and, like many\r\nothers of her time, regarded it as an accomplishment to express herself\r\nin verse on sentimental occasions. One of my daughters, whom she never\r\nsaw, owns the original manuscript of the following lines written as a\r\ntribute of friendship to the daughter of President John Tyler, at the\r\ntime of her marriage:--\r\n\r\n    TO MISS TYLER ON HER WEDDING DAY.\r\n\r\n    The day, the happy day, has come\r\n      That gives you to your lover's arms;\r\n    Check not the tear or rising bloom\r\n      That springs from all those strange alarms.\r\n\r\n    To be a blest and happy wife\r\n      Is what all women wish to prove;\r\n    And may you know through all your life\r\n      The dear delights of wedded love.\r\n\r\n    'Tis not strange that you should feel\r\n      Confused in every thought and feeling;\r\n    Your bosom heave, the tear should steal\r\n      At thoughts of all the friends you're leaving.\r\n\r\n    Happy girl may your life prove,\r\n      All sunshine, joy and purest pleasure;\r\n    One long, long day of happy love,\r\n      Your husband's joy, his greatest treasure.\r\n\r\n    Be to him all that woman ought,\r\n      In joy and health and every sorrow;\r\n    Let his true pleasures be only sought\r\n      With you to-day, with you to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    Believe not that in palace walls\r\n      'Tis only there that joy you'll find;\r\n    At home with friends in your own halls\r\n      There's more content and peace of mind.\r\n\r\n    More splendor you may find 'tis true,\r\n      And glitter, show, and elevation,\r\n    But if the world of you speak true,\r\n      You prize not wealth or this high station.\r\n\r\n    Your heart's too pure, your mind too high,\r\n      To prize such empty pomp and state;\r\n    You leave such scenes without a sigh\r\n      To court the joys that on you wait.\r\n\r\nAfter meeting Mr. and Mrs. Gouverneur, my future husband's father and\r\nhis second wife, at Cold Spring, I renewed my acquaintance with them in\r\nWashington, where they were living in an old-fashioned house on New York\r\nAvenue, between Fourteenth and Fifteenth Streets. We often welcomed Mrs.\r\nGouverneur as a guest at our Washington home and I was subsequently\r\ninvited to visit her at their country seat, Needwood, Frederick County,\r\nMaryland, located upon a tract of land chiefly composed of large farms\r\nat one time owned exclusively by the Lee family. I quote Mrs.\r\nGouverneur's graceful letter of invitation:--\r\n\r\n     My dear Miss Campbell,\r\n\r\n     I can not refrain from writing to remind you of your promise\r\n     to us; this must be about the time fixed upon, (at least we\r\n     all feel as if it was), and the season is so delightful, not\r\n     to mention the strawberries which will be in great\r\n     perfection this week--these reasons, together with our great\r\n     desire to see you, determined me to give you warning that we\r\n     are surely expecting you, and hope to hear very soon from\r\n     you to say when we may send to the _Knoxville_ depot for\r\n     you. I would be so much gratified if Mrs. Eames would come\r\n     with you; it would give us all the sincerest pleasure, and I\r\n     do not think that such a journey would be injurious. You\r\n     leave Washington to come here on the early (6 o'clock)\r\n     train, get out at the Relay House, and wait until the\r\n     western cars pass, (about 8 o'clock), get into them, and\r\n     reach Knoxville at 12 o'clock. So you see that altogether\r\n     you have only six hours, and you rest more than half an hour\r\n     at the Relay House. From Knoxville our carriage brings you\r\n     to \"Needwood\" in less than an hour. If there is any\r\n     gentleman you would like to come as an escort Mr. G. and\r\n     myself will be most happy to see him. Dr. Jones, you know,\r\n     does intend to travel about a little and said he would come\r\n     to see us; perhaps he will come with you, or Mr. Hibbard I\r\n     should be most happy to see--anyone in short whom you choose\r\n     to bring will be most welcome. Tell Mr. Hibbard I read his\r\n     speech and admired it as I presume everyone does. Good-bye,\r\n     dear Miss Campbell. I hope you will aid me in persuading\r\n     Mrs. Eames to come with you. My warmest regards to Mrs.\r\n     Campbell and your sisters, in which my sister [Mrs. Eugene\r\n     H. Lynch] and Mr. Gouverneur unite.\r\n\r\n          Believe me, yours most truly,\r\n\r\n               M. D. GOUVERNEUR.\r\n\r\n     Needwood, May 22nd, 1854.\r\n\r\nI accepted the invitation and, while I was Mrs. Gouverneur's guest, my\r\nsister Margaret was visiting one of the adjoining places at the home of\r\nColonel John Lee, whose wife's maiden name was Harriet Carroll. She was\r\na granddaughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, and their home was the\r\nformer residence of another ancestor, Governor Thomas Sim Lee of\r\nMaryland. During my visit at Needwood I renewed the acquaintance of my\r\nfuture husband, which I had formed a number of years before at the\r\nwedding of Miss Fanny Monroe and Douglas Robinson, of which I have\r\npreviously spoken. It is unnecessary to refer to his appearance, which I\r\nhave already described, but I am sure it is not unnatural for me to add\r\nthat a year after the conclusion of the Mexican War he was brevetted for\r\ngallantry and meritorious conduct in the battles of Contreras and\r\nChurubusco. While his general bearing spoke well for his military\r\ntraining, his mind was a storehouse of information which I learned to\r\nappreciate more and more as the years rolled by. But of all his fine\r\ncharacteristics I valued and revered him most for his fine sense of\r\nhonor and sterling integrity. Like his mother, Mr. Gouverneur was\r\nliterary in his tastes and occasionally gave vent to his feelings in\r\nverse. In 1852 Oak Hill, the stately old Monroe place in Virginia where\r\nhe had spent much of his early life, was about to pass out of the\r\nfamily. He was naturally much distressed over the sale of the home so\r\nintimately associated with his childhood's memory, and a few days prior\r\nto his final departure wrote the following lines. In after years nothing\r\ncould ever induce him to visit Oak Hill.\r\n\r\n    FAREWELL TO OAK HILL, 1852, ON DEPARTING THENCE.\r\n\r\n    The autumn rains are falling fast,\r\n    Earth, the heavens are overcast;\r\n    The rushing winds mournful sigh,\r\n    Whispering, alas! good-bye;\r\n    To each fond remembrance farewell and forever,\r\n    Oak Hill I depart to return to thee never!\r\n\r\n    The mighty oaks beneath whose shade\r\n    In boyhood's happier hours I've played,\r\n    Bend to the mountain blast's wild sweep,\r\n    Scattering spray they seem to weep;\r\n    To each moss-grown tree farewell and forever,\r\n    Oak Hill I depart to return to thee never!\r\n\r\n    The little mound now wild o'ergrown,\r\n    On the bosom of which my tears have oft flown,\r\n    Where my mother beside her mother lies sleeping,\r\n    O'er them the rank grass, bright dew drops are weeping;\r\n    To that hallowed spot farewell and forever,\r\n    Oak Hill I depart to return to thee never!\r\n\r\n    Oh, home of my boyhood, why must I depart?\r\n    Tears I am shedding and wild throbs my heart;\r\n    Home of my manhood, oh! would I had died\r\n    And lain me to rest by my dead mother's side,\r\n    Ere my tongue could have uttered farewell and forever,\r\n    Oak Hill I depart to return to thee never!\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur's pathetic allusion to the graves of his mother and\r\ngrandmother affords me an opportunity of saying that in 1903 the\r\nLegislature of Virginia appropriated a sum of money sufficient to\r\nremove the remains of Mrs. Monroe and her daughter, Mrs. Gouverneur,\r\nfrom Oak Hill. They now rest in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia,\r\non opposite sides of the grave of James Monroe.\r\n\r\nThe friendship of Mr. Gouverneur and myself ripened into a deep\r\naffection, and the winter following my visit to Needwood we announced\r\nour engagement. I was warmly welcomed into the Gouverneur family, as\r\nwill appear from the following letter:\r\n\r\n     I can not longer defer, my dear Marian, expressing the great\r\n     gratification I experienced when Sam informed me of his\r\n     happiness in having gained your heart. It is most agreeable\r\n     to me that you of all the women I know should be the object\r\n     of his choice. How little I anticipated such a result from\r\n     the short visit you made us last summer. Sam is in an\r\n     Elysium of bliss. I have lately had a charming letter from\r\n     him, of course all about his lady love. I think you too have\r\n     every reason to anticipate a life of happiness, not more\r\n     marred than we must all look for in this world. Sam is very\r\n     warm-hearted and affectionate and possesses a fine mind, as\r\n     you know, and when he marries, you will have nothing to wish\r\n     for. These are his own sentiments and I assure you I\r\n     entirely agree with him.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gouverneur is greatly gratified and both wrote and told\r\n     me how nobly you expressed yourself to him.\r\n\r\n     I am going to Baltimore to-day to meet Mr. G. and perhaps\r\n     may go to Washington. If I do you will see me soon after I\r\n     arrive there. I feel as if I should like so much to talk to\r\n     my future daughter. I take the warmest interest in\r\n     everything concerning Sam's happiness, and my heart is now\r\n     overflowing with thankfulness to you for having contributed\r\n     so much to it.\r\n\r\n     Please remember me in the kindest manner to your mother,\r\n     whose warm hospitality I have not forgotten, and to the\r\n     girls. My sincere congratulations to Margaret who Mary\r\n     [Lee] writes me is as happy as the day is long. Ellen\r\n     desires me to present her congratulations to you and\r\n     Margaret.\r\n\r\n          Believe me, very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n               M. D. GOUVERNEUR.\r\n\r\n     Needwood, Feb. 14th.\r\n\r\nI was married in Washington in the old G Street house, and the occasion\r\nwas made especially festive by the presence of many friends from out of\r\ntown. We were married by the Rev. Dr. Smith Pyne, rector of St. John's\r\nEpiscopal Church, and I recall his nervous state of mind, owing to the\r\nfact that he had forgotten to inquire whether a marriage license had\r\nbeen procured; but when he was assured that everything was in due form\r\nhe was quite himself again. Among those who came from New York to attend\r\nthe wedding were General Scott; my father's old friend and associate,\r\nHugh Maxwell; his daughter, now the wife of Rear Admiral John H. Upshur,\r\nU.S.N.; and Miss Sally Strother and her mother. Miss Emily Harper and\r\nMrs. Solomon B. Davies, who was Miss Bettie Monroe, my husband's\r\nrelative, came from Baltimore and, of course, Mr. and Mrs. Gouverneur\r\nand Miss Mary Lee from Needwood were also present.\r\n\r\nMy own family circle was small, as my sister, Mrs. Eames, and her young\r\nchildren were in Venezuela, where her husband was the U.S. Minister; but\r\nI was married in the presence of my mother, my two younger sisters,\r\nMargaret and Charlotte, and my brothers, James and Malcolm. Mr.\r\nGouverneur's only sister, Elizabeth, who some years before had married\r\nDr. Henry Lee Heiskell, Assistant Surgeon General of the Army,\r\naccompanied by her husband and son, the late James Monroe Heiskell, of\r\nBaltimore, a handsome and promising youth, were also there. Among the\r\nother guests were Charles Sumner, Caleb Cushing and Stephen A. Douglas,\r\nnone of whom at that time were married; Peter Grayson Washington, then\r\nAssistant Secretary of the Treasury, and a relative of my husband; Miss\r\nKatharine Maria Wright, who shortly thereafter married Baron J. C.\r\nGevers, _Chargé d'affaires_ from Holland; her brother, Edward Wright, of\r\nNewark; John G. Floyd of Long Island; James Guthrie, Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and his two daughters; William L. Marcy, Secretary of State,\r\nand his wife; their daughter, Miss Cornelia Marcy, subsequently Mrs.\r\nEdmund Pendleton; Baron von Grabow and Alexandre Gau of the Prussian\r\nLegation, the latter of whom married my sister, Margaret, the following\r\nyear; Mr. and Mrs. William T. Carroll; Lieutenant (subsequently Rear\r\nAdmiral) James S. Palmer of the Navy; Jerome E. Kidder of Boston, and\r\nGeneral William J. Hardee, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nA few days before my marriage I received the following letter from\r\nEdward Everett:--\r\n\r\n     BOSTON, 23 Feb.\r\n\r\n     My dear Miss Campbell,\r\n\r\n     I had much pleasure in receiving this morning Mrs.\r\n     Campbell's invitation and your kind note of the 20th. I am\r\n     greatly indebted to you for remembering me on an occasion of\r\n     so much interest and importance, and I beg to offer you my\r\n     sincere congratulations.\r\n\r\n     Greatly would it rejoice me to be able to avail myself of\r\n     your invitation to be present at your nuptials.\r\n\r\n     But the state of my health and of my family makes this\r\n     impossible. But I shall certainly be with you in spirit, and\r\n     with cordial wishes for your happiness.\r\n\r\n     Praying my kindest remembrance to your mother and sisters, I\r\n     remain,\r\n\r\n          my dear Miss Campbell,\r\n\r\n               Sincerely your friend,\r\n\r\n                    EDWARD EVERETT.\r\n\r\n     P.S. I suppose you saw in the papers a day or two ago that\r\n     poor Miss Russell is gone.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Russell referred to by Mr. Everett was Miss Ida Russell, one\r\nof three handsome and brilliant sisters prominent in Boston in the\r\nsociety of the day.\r\n\r\nSoon after my marriage my husband and I made a round of visits to his\r\nnumerous family connections. It is with more than usual pleasure that I\r\nrecall the beautiful old home of Mr. Gouverneur's aunt, Mrs. Thomas\r\nCadwalader, near Trenton, which a few years later was destroyed by fire.\r\nA guest of the Cadwaladers at the same time with ourselves was my\r\nhusband's first cousin, the Rev. Robert Livingston Tillotson of New\r\nYork, who studied for the Episcopal ministry and subsequently entered\r\nthe Roman Catholic priesthood.\r\n\r\nFrom Trenton, we journeyed to Yonkers, New York, to visit the Van\r\nCortlandt family at the historic manor-house in that vicinity. It was\r\nthen owned and occupied by Mr. Gouverneur's relatives, Dr. Edward N.\r\nBibby and his son, Augustus, the latter of whom had recently changed his\r\nname from Bibby to Van Cortlandt, as a consideration for the inheritance\r\nof this fine old estate. Dr. Bibby married Miss Augusta White of the Van\r\nCortlandt descent, and for many years was a prominent physician in New\r\nYork City. When I visited the family, he had retired from active\r\npractice and was enjoying a serene old age surrounded by his children\r\nand grandchildren. Henry Warburton Bibby, the Doctor's second son, was\r\nalso one of this household at the time of our visit. He never married\r\nbut retained his social tastes until his death a few years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room of the Van Cortlandt home stood a superb pair of\r\nbrass andirons in the form of lions, which had been presented to Mrs.\r\nAugustus Van Cortlandt by my husband's mother as a bridal present. They\r\nhad been brought by James Monroe upon his return from France, where he\r\nhad been sent upon his historic diplomatic mission by Washington. The\r\nstyle of life led by the Van Cortlandt family was fascinating to me as,\r\neven at this late date, they clung to many of the old family customs\r\ninherited from their ancestors. Our next visit was to the cottage of\r\nWilliam Kemble in Cold Spring, and it seemed to me like returning to an\r\nold and familiar haunt. My marriage into the Gouverneur family added\r\nanother link in the chain of friendship attaching me to the members of\r\nthe Kemble family, as they were relatives of my husband. I was\r\nentertained while there by the whole family connection, and I recall\r\nwith especial pleasure the dinner parties at Gouverneur Kemble's and at\r\nMrs. Robert P. Parrott's. Martin Van Buren was visiting \"Uncle Gouv\" at\r\nthe time, and I was highly gratified to meet him again, as his presence\r\nnot only revived memories of childhood's days during my father's\r\nlifetime in New York, but also materially assisted in rendering the\r\nentertainments given in my honor at Cold Spring unusually delightful.\r\nFrom Cold Spring we drove to The Grange, near Garrison's, another\r\nhomestead familiar to me in former days, and the residence of Frederick\r\nPhilipse, where I renewed my acquaintance with old friends who now\r\ngreeted me as a relative. At this beautiful home I saw a pair of\r\nandirons even handsomer than those at the Van Cortlandt mansion. They\r\nwere at least two feet high and represented trumpeters. The historic\r\nhouse was replete with ancestral furniture and fine old portraits, one\r\nof which was attributed to Vandyke.\r\n\r\nThe whole Philipse and Gouverneur connection at Garrison's were devoted\r\nEpiscopalians and were largely instrumental in building a fine church at\r\nGarrison's, which they named St. Philips. In more recent years a\r\ncongregation of prominent families has worshiped in this edifice--among\r\nothers, the Fishes, Ardens, Livingstons, Osborns and Sloanes. For many\r\nyears the beloved rector of this church was the Rev. Dr. Charles F.\r\nHoffman, a gentleman of great wealth and much scholarly ability. He and\r\nhis brother, the late Rev. Dr. Eugene A. Hoffman, Dean of the General\r\nTheological Seminary in New York, devoted their lives and fortunes to\r\nthe cause of religion. Residents of New York are familiar with All\r\nAngels Church, built by the late Rev. Dr. Charles F. Hoffman on West End\r\nAvenue, of which he was rector for a number of years. During his life at\r\nGarrison's, both Dr. and Mrs. Hoffman were very acceptable to my\r\nhusband's relatives, especially as the Doctor was connected with the\r\nfamily by right of descent from a Gouverneur forbear. Charles F. Hoffman\r\nmarried Miss Eleanor Louisa Vail, a daughter of David M. Vail of New\r\nBrunswick, New Jersey, who in every way proved herself an able helpmeet\r\nto him. Mrs. Hoffman was educated at Miss Hannah Hoyt's school in New\r\nBrunswick, a fashionable institution of the day, and at a reunion of the\r\nscholars held in recent years, she was mentioned in the following\r\nappropriate manner: \"Nearly half a century ago, in the well-known Miss\r\nHoyt's school, was Eleanor Louisa Vail who was noted for her good\r\nlessons and considerate ways towards all. She never overlooked those who\r\nwere less fortunate than herself, but gave aid to any who needed it,\r\neither in their lessons or in a more substantial form. In the wider\r\ncircle of New York the benevolent Mrs. Hoffman, the wife of the late\r\ngenerous rector of All Angels Church, but fulfilled the promise made by\r\nthe beautiful girl of former days.\" Mr. and Mrs. Charles F. Hoffman's\r\ndaughter, Mrs. J. Van Vechten Olcott, is as beloved in her generation as\r\nher mother was before her.\r\n\r\nSamuel Mongan Warburton Gouverneur, a younger brother of Frederick\r\nPhilipse, was living at The Grange at the time of my visit. Some years\r\nlater he built a handsome house in the neighborhood which he called\r\n\"Eagle's Rest,\" and resided there with his sister, Miss Mary Marston\r\nGouverneur. After his death, the place was sold to the late Louis\r\nFitzgerald, who made it his home.\r\n\r\nAfter six months spent in the mountainous regions of Maryland, not far\r\nfrom Cumberland, on property owned by my husband's family, Mr.\r\nGouverneur and I returned to Washington and began our married life in my\r\nmother's home. Soon after we had settled down, my eldest daughter was\r\nborn. The death of my sister, Mrs. Alexandre Gau, from typhoid fever\r\nsoon followed. It was naturally a terrible shock to us all and\r\nespecially to me, as we were near of an age and our lives had been side\r\nby side from infancy. My mother, in her great affliction, broke up her\r\nhome and Mr. Gouverneur and I rented a house on Twelfth Street, near N\r\nStreet, a locality then regarded as quite suburban. Here I endeavored to\r\nlive in the closest retirement, as the meeting with friends of former\r\ndays only served to bring my sorrow more keenly before me.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my whole life was devoted to the little girl whom we had named\r\nMaud Campbell, and who, of course, had become \"part and parcel\" of my\r\nquiet life. Mr. Gouverneur was the last surviving member of his family\r\nin the male line, and the whole family connection was looking to me to\r\nperpetuate his name. Soon after the birth of my daughter my husband\r\nreceived the following characteristic letter from Mr. Gouverneur's aunt,\r\nMrs. David Johnstone Verplanck, who before her marriage was Louisa A.\r\nGouverneur, a gifted woman whose home was in New York:\r\n\r\n     THURSDAY, April 10th.\r\n\r\n     My dear Sam,\r\n\r\n     In return for your kind recollections I hasten to offer my\r\n     most sincere congratulations to yourself and Mrs. G. As\r\n     husband and father you have now realized all the romance of\r\n     life, the pleasures of which I have little doubt you already\r\n     begin to feel deeply intermingled with many anxious hours.\r\n     It is wisest and best to enjoy all that good fortune sends\r\n     and fortify ourselves to meet and endure the trials to which\r\n     our Destiny has allotted.\r\n\r\n     Tell Mrs. G. that we must send for the girdle the old woman\r\n     sent the Empress Eugénie. She had a succession of seven\r\n     sons, and requested her to wear it for luck. As it was very\r\n     dirty the royal lady sent it back. It might be procured and\r\n     undergo the purifying influence of water. All I can say at\r\n     present to console your disappointment I hope a son will\r\n     soon consummate all your joys and wishes. You know it rests\r\n     with you to keep the name of Gouverneur in the land of the\r\n     living. It is nearly extinct and you its only salvation.\r\n\r\n     I regret to hear your father is unwell at Barnum's [Hotel,\r\n     Baltimore]. I hope he will soon be with us. I long to see\r\n     him.\r\n\r\n          Believe me always your friend,\r\n\r\n               LOUISA VERPLANCK.\r\n\r\nI also append a letter received by Mr. Gouverneur from Mrs. William\r\nKemble (Margaret Chatham Seth), which recalled many tender associations.\r\n\r\n     NEW YORK 11th April.\r\n\r\n     I need not tell you, my dear friend, how much we were all\r\n     gratified by your kind remembrance of us, in the midst of\r\n     your own anxiety and joy, to give us the first news of our\r\n     dear Marian's safety. Give my very best love to her and a\r\n     kiss to Miss Gouverneur with whom I hope to be better\r\n     acquainted hereafter.\r\n\r\n     Mr. and Mrs. Nourse with our dear little Charlie left us\r\n     yesterday for Washington. You will probably see them before\r\n     you receive this. I feel assured that Marian is blessed in\r\n     being with her mother who has every experience necessary for\r\n     her. Therefore it is idle for me to give my advice but I\r\n     must say, keep her quiet, not to be too smart or anxious to\r\n     show her baby--at first--and she will be better able to do\r\n     it afterwards. May God bless you all three and that this\r\n     dear pledge committed to your charge be to you both every\r\n     comfort and joy that your anxious hearts can wish. Please to\r\n     give my best regards and wishes to Mrs. Campbell and her\r\n     daughter from\r\n\r\n          your sincerely attached friend and cousin,\r\n\r\n               M. C. KEMBLE.\r\n\r\nOn the corner of Fourteenth and P Streets, and not far from our home,\r\nwas the residence of Eliab Kingman, an intimate friend of Mr.\r\nGouverneur's father. This locality, now such a business center, was\r\ndecidedly rural, and Mr. Kingman's quaint and old-fashioned house was in\r\nthe middle of a small farm. It was an oddly constructed dwelling and the\r\ninterior was made unusually attractive by its wealth of curios, among\r\nwhich was a large collection of Indian relics. After his death I\r\nattended an auction held in the old home and I remember that these\r\ncuriosities were purchased by Ben Perley Poore, the well-known\r\njournalist. Although many years his senior, my husband found Mr. Kingman\r\nand his home a source of great pleasure to him, and he formed an\r\nattachment for his father's early friend which lasted through life. The\r\nKingman house was the rendezvous of both literary and political circles.\r\nWilliam H. Seward was one of its frequent visitors and I once heard him\r\nwittily remark that it might appropriately be worshiped, as it resembled\r\nnothing \"that is in the Heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or the\r\nwater under the earth.\" For a number of years Mr. Kingman was a\r\ncorrespondent of _The Baltimore Sun_ under the _nom de plume_ of \"Ion.\"\r\nHis communications were entirely confined to political topics and he was\r\nsuch a skilled diplomatist that the adherents of either party, after\r\nperusing them, might easily recognize him as their own advocate. Thomas\r\nSeaton Donoho, of whom I shall speak presently, was a warm friend of Mr.\r\nKingman and the constant recipient of his hospitality. Among his poems\r\nis a graceful sonnet entitled\r\n\r\n    E. KINGMAN.\r\n\r\n    Ever will I remember with delight\r\n      Strawberry Knoll; not for the berries red,\r\n      As, ere my time, the vines were out of bed,\r\n    And gone; but many a day and many a night\r\n    Have given me argument to love it well,\r\n      Whether in Summer, 'neath its perfumed shade,\r\n      Whether by moonlight's magic wand arrayed,\r\n    Or when in Winter's lap the rose leaves fell,\r\n    For pleasant faces ever there were found,\r\n      For genial welcome ever met me there,\r\n    And thou, my friend, when thought went smiling round,\r\n      Madest her calm look, reflecting thine, more fair.\r\n    Those who have known thee as a Statesman, know\r\n    Thy noon-day: I have felt thy great heart's sunset glow!\r\n\r\nMr. Kingman married Miss Cordelia Ewell of Virginia, a relative of\r\nGeneral Richard S. Ewell of the Confederate Army. She was in some\r\nrespects a remarkable character, a \"dyed-in-the-wool\" Southerner and a\r\nwoman of unusual personal charm and ability. In dress, manner and\r\ngeneral appearance she presented a fitting reminder of the _grande dame_\r\nof long ago. Her style of dress reminded one of the Quaker school. Her\r\ngray gown with a white kerchief crossed neatly upon her breast and her\r\ngray hair with puffs clustered around her ears, together with her quaint\r\nmanner of courtesying as she greeted her guests, suggested the familiar\r\nsetting of an old-fashioned picture. She was an accomplished performer\r\nupon the harp as well as an authority upon old English literature. In\r\nall the years I knew her I never heard of her leaving her house. She had\r\nno children and her constant companion was a venerable parrot.\r\n\r\nJohn Savage, familiarly known as \"Jack\" Savage, was an intimate friend\r\nof the Kingmans and also a frequent guest of ours. He was an Irish\r\npatriot of 1848 and was remarkable for his versatility. He had a fine\r\nvoice, and I remember seeing him on one occasion hold his audience\r\nspell-bound while singing \"The Temptation of St. Anthony.\" He was an\r\naccomplished journalist and the author of several books, one of which,\r\n\"The Modern Revolutionary History and Literature of Ireland,\" has been\r\npronounced the best work extant \"on the last great revolutionary era of\r\nthe Irish race.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War I often met at Mr. Kingman's house General Benjamin\r\nF. Butler, whose withering gift of sarcasm is still remembered. Simon\r\nCameron, Lincoln's first Secretary of War, was also a frequent visitor\r\nthere. He was an unusually genial and cordial gentleman, and some years\r\nlater Mr. Kingman and my husband, upon his urgent invitation, visited\r\nhim at his handsome country place, Lochiel, in Pennsylvania. His fine\r\ngraperies made such a vivid impression upon my husband that his\r\ndescription of them almost enabled me to see the luscious fruit itself\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\nMy old friends, Purser Horatio Bridge, U.S.N., and his wife, lived on\r\nthe corner of K and Fourteenth Streets at a hotel then known as the\r\nRugby House. Mrs. Bridge was a sister of the famous beauty, Miss Emily\r\nMarshall, who married Harrison Gray Otis of Boston. Mr. Bridge, while on\r\nthe active list, had been stationed for a time in Washington and,\r\nfinding the life congenial and attractive, returned here after his\r\nretirement and with his wife made his home at the Rugby House. While\r\nthere the hotel was offered for sale and was bought by Mr. Bridge, who\r\nenlarged it and changed its name to The Hamilton, in compliment to Mrs.\r\nHamilton Holly, an intimate friend of Mrs. Bridge and the daughter of\r\nAlexander Hamilton. Mrs. Holly, my old and cherished friend, lived in a\r\npicturesque cottage on I Street, on the site of the present Russian\r\nembassy, where so many years later the wife and daughter of Benjamin F.\r\nTracy, Harrison's Secretary of the Navy, lost their lives in a fire that\r\ndestroyed the house. Among the attractions of this home was a remarkable\r\ncollection of Hamilton relics which subsequent to Mrs. Holly's death was\r\nsold at public auction. The sale, however, did not attract any\r\nparticular attention, as the craze for antiques had not yet developed\r\nand the souvenir fiend was then unknown.\r\n\r\nIt was while I was living on Twelfth Street that I first met Miss\r\nMargaret Edes, so well known in after years to Washingtonians. She was\r\nvisiting her relatives, the Donoho family, which lived in my immediate\r\nvicinity. Her host's father was connected with _The National\r\nIntelligencer_, and the son, Thomas Seaton Donoho, was named after\r\nWilliam Winston Seaton, one of its editors. Thomas Seaton Donoho was a\r\ntruly interesting character. He was decidedly romantic in his ideas and\r\nmany incidents of his life were curiously associated with the ivy vine.\r\nHe planted a sprig of it in front of his three-story house, which was\r\nbuilt very much upon the plan of every other dwelling in the\r\nneighborhood, and called his abode \"Ivy Hall\"; while his property in the\r\nvicinity of Washington he named \"Ivy City,\" a locality so well known\r\nto-day by the same name to the sporting fraternity. His book of poems,\r\npublished in Washington in 1860, is entitled \"Ivy-wall\"; and, to cap the\r\nclimax, when a girl was born into the Donoho family she was baptized in\r\nmid-ocean as \"Atlantic May Ivy.\" In addition to his poems, he published,\r\nin 1850, a drama in three acts, entitled, \"Goldsmith of Padua,\" and two\r\nyears later \"Oliver Cromwell,\" a tragedy in five acts.\r\n\r\nSoon after my marriage, Mr. Gouverneur acted as one of the pallbearers\r\nat the funeral of his early friend, Gales Seaton, the son of William\r\nWinston Seaton, and a most accomplished man of affairs. In those days\r\nhonorary pallbearers were unknown and the coffin was borne to the grave\r\nby those with whom the deceased had been most intimately associated. The\r\nSeatons owned a family vault, and the body was carried down into it by\r\nMr. Seaton's old friends. After the funeral I heard Mr. Gouverneur speak\r\nof observing a coffin which held the remains of Mrs. Francis Schroeder,\r\nwho was Miss Caroline Seaton, and whose husband, the father of Rear\r\nAdmiral Seaton Schroeder, U.S.N., was at one time U.S. Minister to\r\nSweden and Norway. Seaton Munroe, a nephew of Gales Seaton, was\r\nprominent in Washington society. He never married and many persons\r\nregarded him as the Ward McAllister of the Capital. When Colonel Sanford\r\nC. Kellogg, U.S.A., then military _attaché_ of the U.S. Embassy in\r\nParis, heard of Munroe's death, he wrote to a mutual friend: \"I do not\r\nbelieve the man lives who has done more for the happiness and welfare of\r\nothers than Seaton Munroe.\" He was one of the prominent founders of the\r\nMetropolitan Club, which commenced its career in the old Morris house on\r\nthe corner of Vermont Avenue and H Street; and later, when it moved to\r\nthe Graham residence on the corner of Fifteenth and H Streets, he\r\ncontinued to be one of its most popular and influential members.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1858, occurred the famous Gwin ball, so readily recalled by\r\nold Washingtonians. It was a fancy-dress affair, and it was the\r\nintention of Senator and Mrs. William McKendree Gwin of California that\r\nit should be the most brilliant of its kind that the National Capital\r\nhad ever known. Of course Mr. Gouverneur and I did not attend, owing to\r\nmy deep mourning, but I shall always remember the pleasure and amusement\r\nwe derived in dressing Mr. Kingman for the occasion. We decked him out\r\nin the old court dress which Mr. Gouverneur's grandfather, James Monroe,\r\nwore during his diplomatic mission in France. As luck would have it the\r\nsuit fitted him perfectly, and the next day it was quite as gratifying\r\nto us as to Mr. Kingman to hear that the costume attracted marked\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe ball was rightly adjudged a brilliant success. Among the guests was\r\nPresident Buchanan, though not, of course, in fancy dress. Senator Gwin\r\nrepresented Louis Quatorze; Ben Perley Poore, \"Major Jack Downing\"; Lord\r\nNapier, George Hammond--the first British Minister to the United States;\r\nMrs. Stephen A. Douglas, Aurora; Mrs. Jefferson Davis, Madame de Staël;\r\nand so on down the list. It is probable that the wife of Senator\r\nClement C. Clay, of Alabama, who represented Mrs. Partington, attracted\r\nmore attention and afforded more amusement than any other guest.\r\nWashington had fairly teemed with her brilliant repartee and other\r\nbright sayings, and upon this occasion she was, if possible, more than\r\never in her element. She had a witty encounter with the President and a\r\nfamiliar home-thrust for all whom she encountered. Many of the public\r\ncharacters present, when lashed by her sparkling humor, were either\r\nunable or unwilling to respond. She was accompanied by \"Ike,\" Mrs.\r\nPartington's son, impersonated by a clever youth of ten years, son of\r\nJohn M. Sandidge of Louisiana. Mr. John Von Sonntag Haviland, formerly\r\nof the U.S. Army, wrote a metrical description of this ball, and in\r\nreferring to Mrs. Clay, thus expresses himself:--\r\n\r\n    Mark how the grace that gilds an honored name,\r\n    Gives a strange zest to that loquacious dame\r\n    Whose ready tongue and easy blundering wit\r\n    Provoke fresh uproar at each happy hit!\r\n    Note how her humour into strange grimace\r\n    Tempts the smooth meekness of yon Quaker's face.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    But--denser grows the crowd round Partington;\r\n    'Twere vain to try to name them one by one.\r\n\r\nMr. Haviland added this to the above:--\"Mrs. Senator Clay, with knitting\r\nin hand, snuff-box in pocket, and 'Ike, the Inevitable,' by her side,\r\nacted out her difficult character so as to win the unanimous verdict\r\nthat her personation of the loquacious _mal-aprops_ dame was the leading\r\nfeature of the evening's entertainment. Go where she would through the\r\nspacious halls, a crowd of eager listeners followed her footsteps,\r\ndrinking in her instant repartees, which were really superior in wit and\r\nappositeness, and, indeed, in the vein of the famous dame's _cacoëthes_,\r\neven to the original contribution of Shillaber to the nonsensical\r\nliterature of the day.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the guests at this ball was the wife of the late Major General\r\nWilliam H. Emery, U.S.A., whose maiden name was Matilda Bache. She was\r\narrayed for the evening in the garb of a Quakeress, and it is to her\r\nthat Mr. Haviland alludes in his reference to the \"smooth meekness of\r\nyon Quaker's face.\"\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the Civil War, Senator Gwin was arrested on a\r\ncharge of disloyalty and imprisoned until 1863. He then went to Paris,\r\nwhere he became interested in a scheme for the colonization by\r\nSoutherners of the State of Sonora in Mexico, in consequence of which he\r\nwas sometimes facetiously called the \"Duke of Sonora.\" While thus\r\nengaged, he was invited to meet the Emperor, Napoleon III., in private\r\naudience, and succeeded in enlisting his sympathies. It is said that,\r\nupon the request of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he formulated a\r\nplan for the colony which, after receiving the Emperor's approval, was\r\nsubmitted to Maximilian. The latter was then in Paris and requested Mr.\r\nGwin's attendance at the Tuileries where, after diligent inquiry, the\r\nscheme received the approbation of Maximilian. Two weeks after the\r\ndeparture of the latter for Mexico, Mr. Gwin left for the same country,\r\ncarrying with him an autograph letter of Napoleon III. to Marshal\r\nBazaine. The scheme, however, received no encouragement from the latter,\r\nand Maximilian failed to give him any satisfactory assurances of his\r\nsupport. Returning to France in 1865, he secured an audience with the\r\nEmperor, to whom he exposed the condition of affairs in Mexico. Napoleon\r\nurged him to return to that country immediately with a peremptory order\r\nto Marshal Bazaine to supply a military force adequate to accomplish the\r\nproject. This request was complied with but Mr. Gwin, after meeting with\r\nno success, demanded an escort to accompany him out of the country. This\r\nwas promptly furnished, and he returned to his home in California.\r\n\r\nIt seems fitting in this connection to speak of a brilliant ball in\r\nWashington in 1824. Although, of course, I do not remember it, I have\r\nheard of it all my life and have gathered here and there certain facts\r\nof interest concerning it, some of which are not easily accessible. I\r\nrefer to the ball given by Mrs. John Quincy Adams, whose husband was\r\nthen Secretary of State under Monroe. Mrs. Adams' maiden name was Louisa\r\nCatharine Johnson and she was a daughter of Joshua Johnson, who served\r\nas our first United States Consul at London, and a niece of Thomas\r\nJohnson of Maryland. She gave receptions in Washington on Tuesday\r\nevenings which were attended by many of the most distinguished men and\r\nwomen of the day. This period, in fact, is generally regarded as,\r\nperhaps, the most brilliant era in Washington society. A generous\r\nhospitality was dispensed by such men as Madison, Monroe, Adams,\r\nCalhoun, Wirt, Rush, Southard, General Winfield Scott and General\r\nAlexander Macomb. The British _Chargé d'affaires_ at this time was Henry\r\nUnwin Addington. The Russian Minister was the Baron de Tuyll; while\r\nFrance, Spain and Portugal were represented by gentlemen of\r\ndistinguished manners and rare accomplishments. The illustrious John\r\nMarshall was Chief Justice, with Joseph Story, Bushrod Washington, Smith\r\nThompson and other eminent jurists by his side. In Congress were such\r\nmen as Henry Clay, William Gaston, Rufus King, Daniel Webster, Andrew\r\nJackson, Thomas H. Benton, William Jones Lowndes, John Jordan Crittenden\r\nand Harrison Gray Otis; while the Navy was represented by Stephen\r\nDecatur, David Porter, John Rodgers, Lewis Warrington, Charles Stewart,\r\nCharles Morris and others, some of whom made their permanent home at the\r\nCapital.\r\n\r\nThe ball given by the Secretary of State and Mrs. Adams was in honor of\r\nGeneral Andrew Jackson, and was not only an expression of the pleasant\r\npersonal relations existing between John Quincy Adams and Jackson only\r\nshortly before the former defeated the latter for the Presidency, but\r\nalso a pleasing picture of Washington society at that time. General\r\nJackson was naturally the hero of the occasion, and there was a throng\r\nof guests not only from Washington but also from Baltimore, Richmond and\r\nother cities. A current newspaper of the day published a metrical\r\ndescription of the event, written by John T. Agg:\r\n\r\n    MRS.

Crowninshield, Secretary of the Navy under\r\nMadison and Monroe. \"The Pierces, with their heavenly faces,\" were\r\nhandsome Boston women who in after life became converts to the Roman\r\nCatholic faith and entered convents. The \"Vails\" were Eugene and Aaron\r\nVail, who were protégés of Senator William H. Crawford, of Georgia. They\r\nmarried sisters, daughters of Laurent Salles, a wealthy Frenchman living\r\nin New York. Aaron Vail accompanied Martin Van Buren to England as\r\nSecretary of Legation and for a season, after Van Buren's recall, acted\r\nas _Chargé d'affaires_. \"Tayloe\" was Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, the\r\ndistinguished Washingtonian. \"Ramsay\" was General George Douglas Ramsay,\r\nthe father of Rear Admiral Francis M. Ramsay, U.S.N.; and \"Hellen\" was\r\nMrs. Adams's niece, who subsequently became her daughter-in-law through\r\nher marriage to her son, John Adams. President Monroe attended this ball\r\nand both he and John Quincy Adams were somewhat criticised for their\r\nplain attire, which was in such striking contrast with the elaborate\r\ncostumes and decorations worn by the foreign guests.\r\n\r\nIn his boyhood Mr. Gouverneur formed an intimacy with George H. Derby,\r\nbetter known in literary circles under the _nom de plume_ of \"John\r\nPhoenix.\" He is well remembered by students of American humor as a\r\ncontemporary and rival of Artemus Ward. He was a member of a prominent\r\nBoston family, and of the class of 1846 at West Point. He was a gallant\r\nsoldier, having been wounded during the Mexican War at Cerro Gordo, and\r\nwas promoted for his bravery in that battle. Scarcely anyone was immune\r\nfrom his practical jokes, but, fortunately for his peace of mind, Mr.\r\nGouverneur was acquainted with an incident of his life which, if known,\r\nwould make him a butt of ridicule; and he accordingly felt perfectly\r\nsafe in his companionship and well enjoyed his humorous exploits. One\r\nday Derby and Mr. Gouverneur were sauntering through the streets of\r\nWashington when the keen eye of the humorist was attracted by a sign\r\nover a store door which read, \"Ladies' Depository\"--the old-fashioned\r\nmethod of designating what would now be called a \"Woman's Exchange.\"\r\nTurning to his companion, Derby remarked: \"I have a little business to\r\ntransact in this shop and I want you to go inside with me.\" They entered\r\nand were met by a smiling female to whom Derby remarked: \"My wife will\r\nbe here to-morrow morning. I am so pleased to have discovered this\r\ndepository. I hope that you will take good care of her. Expect her at\r\neleven. Good-morning.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early '50's Adjutant General Roger Jones determined to adopt a\r\nnew uniform for the U.S. Army, and Derby was thus afforded a conspicuous\r\nopportunity to exercise his wit. He was an excellent draughtsman and set\r\nto work and produced a design. He proposed changing the entire system of\r\nmodern tactics by the aid of an iron hook to be attached to the seat of\r\neach soldier's trousers, this hook to be used by the three arms of the\r\nservice--cavalry, infantry and artillery. He illustrated it by a series\r\nof well-executed designs, and quoted high medical authority to prove its\r\nadvantages from a sanitary point of view. He argued that the heavy\r\nknapsack induced a stooping position and a contraction of the chest but,\r\nhung on a hook by a strap over the shoulders, it would brace the body\r\nand back and expand the chest. The cavalrymen were to be rendered more\r\nsecure in their seats when hooked to a ring in the saddle. All\r\ncommissioned officers were to carry a light twenty-foot pole, with a\r\nring attached to the end, to be used during an engagement in drawing\r\nstragglers back into the ranks. He made a drawing of a tremendous battle\r\nduring which the Generals and Colonels were thus occupied, and in many\r\nother ways expatiated upon the value of the hook. When Jefferson Davis,\r\nthe Secretary of War, saw Derby's designs and read his recommendations,\r\nhe felt that his dignity was wounded and the service insulted, and he\r\nimmediately issued an order that Derby be court-martialed. William L.\r\nMarcy, then Secretary of State, was told of the transaction and of the\r\ncloud hanging over Derby. He looked over the drawings and saw a\r\nregiment, their backs towards him and drawn up in line, with knapsacks,\r\nblankets and everything appertaining to camp life attached to each\r\nsoldier by a hook. Marcy, who saw the humorous side at once, said to\r\nDavis: \"It's no use to court-martial this man. The matter will be made\r\npublic and the laugh will be upon us. Besides, a man who has the\r\ninventive genius that he has displayed, as well as the faculty of\r\ndesign, ill-directed though they be, is too valuable to the service to\r\nbe trifled with.\" Derby therefore was not brought to grief, and in time\r\nDavis's anger was sufficiently mollified for him to enjoy the joke. I am\r\nenabled to state, through the courtesy of the present Assistant\r\nSecretary of War, that the drawings referred to are not now to be found\r\nin the files of the War Department; and a picture, which at the time was\r\nthe source of untold amusement and of wide-spread notoriety, seems to be\r\nlost to the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINIATURE OF JAMES MONROE, PAINTED IN PARIS IN 1794, BY\r\nSEMÉ.\r\n\r\n_Original owned by Mrs. Gouverneur._]\r\n\r\nAn incident connected with the Indian War of 1856-58, in Washington\r\nTerritory, furnished another outlet for Derby's effective wit. A\r\nCatholic priest was taken prisoner by the savages at that time and led\r\naway into captivity, and in caricaturing the scene Derby represented an\r\necclesiastic in full canonicals walking between two stalwart and\r\nhalf-naked Indians, carrying a crook and crozier, with a tooth-brush\r\nattached to one and a comb to the other; while the letters \"I. H. S.\" on\r\nthe priest's chasuble were paraphrased into the words, \"I hate\r\nSiwashes.\" It must not be thought, however, that Derby's life was wholly\r\ndevoted to fun and frivolity, for he has been pronounced by an\r\naccomplished military writer and critic to have been \"an able and\r\naccomplished engineer.\" He was the author of \"The Squibob Papers\" and of\r\n\"Phoenixiana; or Sketches and Burlesques,\" either of which would\r\nworthily place him in the forefront of humorists in the history of\r\nAmerican literature. I own a copy of the latter book which was given by\r\nthe author to my husband. It seems strange, when one considers the\r\ncharacter and career of this gifted man, that subsequent to his death\r\nnearly every member of his family should have met with a tragic end.\r\n\r\nAlthough not a practical joker, my husband found much in Derby that was\r\ncongenial, as many of their tastes were similar. Both of them were\r\ndevoted to literature and both were accomplished writers; but while\r\nDerby published his works and was rewarded with financial success, Mr.\r\nGouverneur wrote chiefly for the newspaper press. He edited and\r\npublished a work by James Monroe, entitled \"The People the Sovereigns,\"\r\nbut never sent to the press any works of his own production. I think\r\nthat the lack of encouragement from me was the chief obstacle that\r\ndeterred him from embarking upon a literary career. He commenced several\r\nnovels but never finished them, and his chief literary remains are\r\nprincipally confined to the limits of his \"commonplace-books.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan's niece, Harriet Lane, subsequently Mrs. Henry\r\nElliott Johnston of Maryland, presided with grace and dignity over the\r\nWhite House during her uncle's administration. I first met Miss Lane\r\nbefore the period when Buchanan represented the United States at the\r\nCourt of St. James. It was at a party given by Mrs. Hamilton Fish,\r\nwhose husband was then a U.S. Senator from the State of New York. Her\r\nblond type of beauty made an indelible impression upon me, as she was\r\nvery much the same style as the daughters of General Winfield Scott.\r\nSome years before her death, while she was living in Washington, I\r\nincidentally referred to this resemblance between the Scotts and herself\r\nand was not surprised to hear her say that others had spoken of it. To\r\nan exceptionally fine presence, she added unusual intelligence and\r\nbrilliant power of repartee. I have often heard the story that at a\r\nsocial function at the White House an accomplished courtier was\r\nenlarging to Miss Lane upon her shapely hands--\"hands,\" he ejaculated,\r\n\"that might have swayed the rod of empire.\" Her retort came without a\r\nmoment's hesitation, \"or wake to ecstasy the living lyre.\" Emily\r\nSchomberg, who married Hughes Hallett of England, wrote some years ago a\r\ncharming sketch of Harriet Lane Johnston which was published in Mrs.\r\nElizabeth F. Ellet's book entitled, \"The Court Circles of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent belles of the Buchanan administration, and an\r\nintimate friend and companion of Harriet Lane, was Rebecca B. Black,\r\ndaughter of the eminent jurist, Judge Jeremiah S. Black of Pennsylvania,\r\nAttorney-General and for a time Secretary of State under Buchanan. She\r\nwas the widow of Isham Hornsby of Washington, where, in her beautiful\r\nhome, she was surrounded by a charming circle and was much admired and\r\nbeloved. Peter Grayson Washington, a son of Lund Washington, whom I have\r\nalready mentioned in connection with my wedding, was a conspicuous\r\nfigure at the National Capital during the Buchanan _régime_. During the\r\nPierce administration he was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under\r\nJames Guthrie. He had an impressive bearing, and carried a gold-headed\r\ncane which he boasted had originally belonged to his distinguished\r\nrelative, the first President. Although by birth a Virginian, Mr.\r\nWashington never wavered in his loyalty to the Union. During the latter\r\npart of the Civil War he made a visit to us in our Maryland home, and I\r\nshall always remember the expression of his opinion that many leaders of\r\nthe Confederate cause were not true representatives of the South, citing\r\nas examples some members of Jefferson Davis's cabinet. He concluded his\r\nremarks with the facetious statement that \"if they had only chosen a\r\nsecond Washington as a leader they might have been successful.\" Earlier\r\nresidents of the District will recall Littleton Quinton Washington, a\r\nprolific writer chiefly upon political subjects, and a younger\r\nhalf-brother of Peter G. Washington.\r\n\r\nMy old and valued friend, Mrs. Hamilton Holly, and Peter Grayson\r\nWashington were the Godparents of my eldest daughter. At the earnest\r\nrequest of the former, this ceremony took place in the house of Mrs.\r\nAlexander Hamilton, in the De Menou buildings. Mrs. Holly and I\r\ncharacterized the gathering as a revolutionary party, as so many of the\r\nguests bore names prominent during our struggle for independence. I\r\nnever saw Mrs. Hamilton Holly again. Shortly after this pleasant\r\nfunction I sailed for China, and just before starting on my long voyage\r\nI received the following note, which saddened me more than I can well\r\nexpress:--\r\n\r\n     SEP. 9th.\r\n\r\n     My dear friend,\r\n\r\n     For many days I have been blessed by your very kind letter,\r\n     but am too, too low to answer it. One day so weak as to be\r\n     obliged with my hand to wave Mrs. Furguson away (another\r\n     lady obtained admittance), lest in the effort to converse I\r\n     might find another home. My hand and head are exhausted.\r\n\r\n          Most truly yours,\r\n\r\n               E. H. HOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSOJOURN IN CHINA AND RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to the Civil War, Mr. Gouverneur received an appointment from\r\nJames Buchanan as U.S. Consul to Foo Chow in China, and I decided to\r\naccompany him upon his long journey. Meanwhile a second daughter had\r\nbeen added to our family, much to the disappointment of the large circle\r\nof relatives who were still anxiously expecting me to hand down the name\r\nof Gouverneur. We named her Ruth Monroe. We took passage upon the\r\nclipper ship _Indiaman_, a vessel of heavy tonnage sailing from New York\r\nand commanded by a \"down-east\" skipper named Smith. No railroads crossed\r\nthe American continent in those days, and the voyage to the far East had\r\nto be made either around Cape Horn or by way of the Isthmus of Panama or\r\naround the Cape of Good Hope. We selected the latter route, leaving New\r\nYork in October and arriving in Shanghai the following March. My\r\npreparations for such a protracted journey with two very young children\r\nwere carefully and even elaborately planned but, to my dismay, some of\r\nthe most important articles of food for the childrens' diet became unfit\r\nfor use long before we reached our destination. As one may readily\r\nimagine, I was accordingly put to my wits' end for substitutes. We also\r\nprovided ourselves with a goodly amount of literature, and more\r\nparticularly books relating to China, among which were Father Evariste\r\nRégis Huc's volume on \"The Chinese Empire,\" and Professor S. Wells\r\nWilliams's work on \"The Middle Kingdom.\" We read these _en route_ with\r\ngreat interest but discovered after a few months' residence in the East\r\nthat no book or pen we then knew conveyed an adequate idea of that\r\nremarkable country.\r\n\r\nWe had a very favorable voyage, and sailing in the trade winds in the\r\nSouthern hemisphere was to me the very acme of bliss. I was thoroughly\r\nin sympathy with the passage of Humboldt where he speaks of the tropical\r\nskies and vegetation in the following beautiful manner:--\"He on whom the\r\nSouthern Cross has never gleamed nor the Centaur frowned, above whom the\r\nclouds of Magellan have never circled, who has never stood within the\r\nshadow of great palms, nor clothed himself with the gloom of the\r\nprimeval forests, does not know how the soul seems to have a new birth\r\nin the midst of these new and splendid surroundings. Nowhere but under\r\nthe equatorial skies is it permitted to man to behold at once and in the\r\nsame sweep of the eye all the stars of both the Northern and Southern\r\nheavens; and nowhere but at the tropics does nature combine to produce\r\nthe various forms of vegetation that are parceled out separately to\r\nother climes.\"\r\n\r\nThe patience of our captain was sorely tried by the lack of wind while\r\npassing through the Doldrums. This nautical locality, varying in breadth\r\nfrom sixty to several hundred miles and shifting in extreme limits at\r\ndifferent seasons of the year, is near the equator and abounds in calms,\r\nsqualls and light, baffling winds which sometimes prevent the progress\r\nof sailing vessels for weeks at a time. When we finally emerged from the\r\nDoldrums, we were compensated for the trying delay by greeting the trade\r\nwinds so cherished by the hearts of mariners. We sailed many leagues\r\nsouth of the Cape of Good Hope and much too far away even to catch a\r\nglimpse of it, but we realized its proximity by the presence of the Cape\r\npigeons which hovered around our vessel. The albatross was also our\r\ndaily visitor and one or two of them were caught by the sailors,\r\nregardless of the superstition of possible calamity attending such an\r\nact. Our only stop during the long voyage was at the Moluccas or Spice\r\nIslands, in the Malay Peninsula, and was made at the request of the\r\npassengers who were desirous of exploring the beauties of that tropical\r\nregion. The waters surrounding these islands were as calm as a lake and\r\nall around our ship floated the débris of spices. The vegetation was\r\nmore beautiful than I can describe and the shells which covered the\r\nshores were eagerly collected by the passengers.\r\n\r\nOur fellow voyagers were four missionaries, who on Sundays conducted\r\ndivine service, and a Mr. Pemberton, a young Canadian who was _en\r\nvoyage_ to join the _Hong_ of Purden and Company in Shanghai. In these\r\nearly days it was the custom of parents of refractory or adventurous\r\nsons to place them on board sailing vessels for lengthy outings.\r\nOccasionally they were sent upon whaling voyages, where the hardships\r\nwere greater and the voyage more prolonged. On the _Indiaman_ there were\r\nseveral of these youths and it was quite pathetic as well as comical to\r\nsee them ascend the rigging amid the jeers of a well-disciplined crew.\r\nOne of them, whose father had occupied an official position in the City\r\nof New York, had been quite a society \"swell\" and claimed acquaintance\r\nwith me. At times he was required by the captain to hold my younger\r\nchild, a mere babe, in the arms. Every now and then we were startled by\r\nher shrieks and for quite a time we could not detect the cause until we\r\nfinally discovered that his task was uncongenial and that, in order to\r\nget rid of his charge, the incorrigible youth had administered an\r\noccasional pinch.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon while sailing in the Indian Ocean we had a narrow\r\nescape from shipwreck. Every sail was set to catch the least breath of\r\nair, and Mr. Gouverneur and the children were on deck with the captain,\r\nwhen in the distance they saw what seemed to resemble a huge wall. The\r\nmoment the experienced eye of our skipper saw it he exclaimed, \"My God,\r\nwe are gone!\" It slowly but surely approached our ship and when it\r\nreached us its force was so great that our sails almost dipped into the\r\nocean. The ship, however, gradually righted itself and we were naturally\r\nmore than grateful for our deliverance. I chanced to be resting in my\r\ncabin at the perilous moment and in a most unceremonious manner was\r\nthrown to the floor. After reaching the mouth of that stupendous river,\r\nthe Yangtze Kiang, we thought our long voyage was nearly ended, but we\r\nsoon discovered that we had not yet \"crossed the Rubicon,\" and that\r\ntrouble was still in store for us. We had just passed the mouth of this\r\nriver and cast anchor when, to our surprise and dismay, we encountered a\r\nsevere storm, and during the night dragged anchor for about twenty\r\nmiles. The morning, however, dawned bright and clear, but our captain,\r\nwho had lost his temper during the storm, did not accord the Chinese\r\npilots who boarded us a very gracious reception. This was my first\r\nglimpse of the Chinese within the limits of their own domain.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the city of Shanghai it was quite dark, but we found\r\ncoolies awaiting us with chairs. I shall never forget my first\r\nimpressions of China. All of my anticipations of the beautiful Orient\r\nwere fully realized, and, as I was carried through the crowded streets,\r\nvisions of the Arabian Nights enchanted me and it seemed to me a\r\nveritable region of delight. The streets of Shanghai, however, after the\r\nbroad thoroughfares of Washington, appeared like small and complicated\r\npathways. They were not lighted with public lamps at this time, but\r\nmyriads of lanterns of every conceivable shape and color carried by\r\nwayfarers met the eye at every turn and made the whole scene appear like\r\nfairyland. But, alas, the following morning I was undeceived, for\r\ndaylight revealed to my vision a very squalid and dirty city. We were\r\ncarried to the largest hotel in Shanghai, where it seemed as though I\r\nwere almost receiving a home greeting when the sign over the door told\r\nme that it was the Astor House! Still another surprise awaited me.\r\nAlthough in a strange land, one of the first persons to welcome me was a\r\nformer acquaintance, the wife of Mr. Robert Morrison Olyphant, the head\r\nof the prominent _Hong_ of Olyphant and Company. Her maiden name was\r\nAnna O. Vernon and I had formerly known her quite well in New York and\r\nNewport.\r\n\r\nWe did not linger long in Shanghai, but embraced the first opportunity\r\nto reach Foo Chow. It was a coast voyage of several days and was\r\nattended with much discomfort, as the choppy seas through which we\r\nsailed made all of us very ill--a remarkable experience, considering the\r\nfact that during the whole of our protracted voyage we had not suffered\r\nan uncomfortable moment. We reached Foo Chow, however, in due time, and\r\nMr. Gouverneur at once assumed his official duties. Foo Chow is called\r\nby the natives _Hok Chiu_, or \"Happy City.\" It is also what is termed a\r\n\"Foo-City,\" signifying a place of the largest magnitude, and was the\r\nsole Chinese port where royalty was represented. It is situated upon the\r\nMin River, about twenty-five miles from its mouth, and is the capital of\r\nthe Province of Fokien. The navigation of the river Min was regarded as\r\ndangerous, and the insurance rates for vessels navigating it were higher\r\nthan those of any other Chinese port. The place is surrounded by\r\ncastellated walls nine or ten miles in circumference, outside of which\r\nare suburbs as extensive as the city itself. Its walls are about thirty\r\nfeet high and twelve wide at the top. Its seven gates are overlooked by\r\nhigh towers, while small guardhouses stand at frequent intervals along\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\nUpon our arrival in Foo Chow we found no house provided for the U.S.\r\nConsul, and immediately made our residence with a missionary family,\r\nwhere we were most comfortable, until the _Hong_ of Augustus Heard and\r\nCompany provided us with a residence for which we paid rent. The English\r\ngovernment took better care of its representative. Not far from us was\r\nthe British Consulate, a fine building reminding one in certain respects\r\nof the White House. In another residence near by, and provided by his\r\ngovernment, lived the British interpreter, a Scotchman named Milne.\r\nWalter H. Medhurst, the British Consul, and his interpreter were\r\ndescendants of early English missionaries. We found Foo Chow to be a\r\nsomewhat lawless city. Many of its inhabitants were mountaineers from\r\nthe surrounding region who had become pretty well starved out and had\r\nfound their way into the city. As a result of their early training, they\r\ngave the authorities much trouble.\r\n\r\nI was naturally much impressed by some of the novel and curious customs\r\nthen prevalent. The seat of honor assigned a guest was on the left of\r\nthe host. The uncovered head for a man was a mark of disrespect and a\r\nservant would accordingly be severely reprimanded if he appeared before\r\nhis master with his hat off. Persons in mourning wore white, in striking\r\ncontrast with the somber apparel used by ourselves. The shoe polish in\r\nvogue was a chalky white substance. From these and other examples it can\r\nreadily be seen I was justified in feeling that I had been transferred\r\nto another planet and had left \"dull earth behind me.\" When we reached\r\nFoo Chow, the gorgeous flowers and other vegetation were at their best.\r\nThe month of April was a season set apart by the Chinese to decorate\r\nwith flowers the graves of their ancestors; and coming from a land where\r\nsuch a ceremony was unknown, it impressed me as a beautiful custom. It\r\nsuggests, moreover, the inquiry as to whether it was from the Chinese,\r\nor from an innate conviction of the beautiful sentiment demanding an\r\noutward expression, that induced the descendants of the Blue and the\r\nGray, at a later period, to strew with flowers the last resting-places\r\nof those whose memories they delighted to honor.\r\n\r\nNext door to the U.S. Consulate lived a Parsee named Botelwalla, who was\r\nan English subject. He never uncovered his head, and his tarpaulin hat\r\ncarried me back to the pictures in my geography while studying at Miss\r\nForbes's school. He was extensively engaged in the opium trade, and had\r\nlarge quantities of it stored in his dwelling. One day he came to our\r\nhome to make a social visit and, taking it for granted that he was a\r\nfire-worshiper, I inquired whether he came from Persia. He told me that\r\ntwelve hundred years ago his family emigrated from that country to\r\nIndia, where their descendants had since resided. I recall an incident\r\nwhich convinced me at the time that he was not a consistent follower of\r\nhis own religion. Mr. Gouverneur noticed smoke issuing one day from what\r\nhe thought was a remote portion of the Botelwalla home, and immediately\r\ncalled out to the Parsee from an adjoining window that his house was on\r\nfire. Without a moment's hesitation, he got all of his family together,\r\nand for a while they worked most strenuously to subdue the flames and to\r\nsave from destruction the hundred thousand dollars' worth of opium\r\nlodged in the Parsee's home. Somewhat later we were surprised to learn\r\nthat it was our own kitchen which was on fire. Our ignorance was due to\r\nthe fact that the walls of the two houses were so irregular and so oddly\r\nconstructed that it was at first exceedingly difficult, upon a\r\nsuperficial view, to distinguish certain portions of our own home from\r\nthose of our neighbor. The one feature, however, connected with the fire\r\nwhich impressed us most forcibly was the fact that Botelwalla, our\r\nneighbor and fire-worshiper, did not allow his religious scruples to\r\ninterfere with the safety of his valuable personal possessions. My\r\nattention, as well as admiration, was frequently directed to a number of\r\nsuperb India cashmere shawls which I often saw airing on his upper\r\nveranda and which, I think, were used for bed coverings.\r\n\r\nSoon after his arrival in Foo Chow, Mr. Gouverneur was fortunate in\r\nsecuring the services of a Chinese interpreter named Ling Kein, a\r\nmandarin of high order, who wore the \"blue button,\" significant of his\r\nrank. In addition to this distinction he wore on his hat the peacock\r\nfeather, an official reward of merit. He was a Chinese of remarkable\r\nintelligence, well versed in English as well as in the Chinese\r\nvernacular, and was also the master of several dialects. He surprised me\r\nby his familiarity with New York, and upon inquiry I learned that he had\r\nonce taken a junk into that port, which was naturally regarded with\r\ngreat curiosity by the Gothamites. He remembered many prominent New\r\nYorkers, one of whom was Daniel Lord, the distinguished lawyer, whom he\r\nhad met in a professional relation. He also recalled my old friend and\r\nMr. Gouverneur's kinsman, William Kemble, who lived next door to Mr.\r\nLord opposite St. John's Park. Ling Kein and his family lived in our\r\nhouse, but they led such secluded lives that I seldom saw them; indeed,\r\nwe never laid eyes upon our interpreter except when his presence was\r\nrequired. He was not in the employ of our government, but his salary of\r\none hundred dollars a month was paid from my husband's private means.\r\nHis services were invaluable and when we first began housekeeping he\r\nsecured our domestic staff for us. The butler was Ning Ping, a\r\nChristianized Chinese, who took entire charge of the\r\nestablishment--going to market, regulating the servants and even handing\r\nthem their wages. For his services he received four dollars a month.\r\n\r\nI found this mode of life ideally pleasant and easy until I heard an\r\nuproar one day in the servants' quarters in which my two nurses seemed\r\nto be involved. I was entirely ignorant as to the cause of the commotion\r\nand for some time held my peace, as one of the first lessons I learned\r\nin China was not to probe too deeply into domestic affairs, since one\r\nderived but little satisfaction from the attempt. As the confusion\r\ncontinued, however, I summoned Ling Kein in order to ascertain the cause\r\nof it. It seems that Ning Ping had paid the women their wages in Mexican\r\ndollars which were not of the proper weight. There prevailed a crafty\r\nmethod of clipping or punching the coins, and this dishonest Chinaman\r\nhad taken advantage of those whom he thought to be simply\r\nunsophisticated women. The trouble was finally quelled by an agreement\r\nthat in future I should personally pay the nurses their wages. I gave\r\neach of these women four dollars a month for their services. Our cook,\r\nTing Ting, who was a chef, and the four coolies, who were the chair\r\nbearers, were also paid four dollars a month each. The gatekeeper, whose\r\nduties were to open and close the front gate and to look after the\r\nchairs of visitors, received a similar sum for his services. I also\r\nemployed by the month a native tailor, whose sole requirements for his\r\nwork were a chair and a table. He did the entire sewing of the\r\nestablishment and charged four dollars a month for his labor. At least\r\none of my experiences with him failed to confirm the extraordinary\r\npowers of imitation possessed by the Chinese, for upon one occasion when\r\nI trusted him with a handsome garment, with strict injunctions to follow\r\nthe model I gave him, he completely ignored my instructions and carried\r\nout his own designs.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us, this retinue of retainers provided its own food and\r\nclothing, and I was in blissful ignorance as to where they stowed\r\nthemselves away for the night. A laundryman called once a week for our\r\nclothes and his charges were two dollars a hundred for articles of every\r\ndescription. I am almost ashamed to acknowledge that I never saw the\r\ninterior of our kitchen, but our cook served our dinners in the most\r\napproved manner. We frequently had guests to dine with us and as the\r\nbutler, Ning Ping, was as much an expert in his department as the cook,\r\nTing Ting, was in his, I was delightfully irresponsible and often\r\nwondered, as I sat at my own table, what the next course would be. Our\r\nguests were principally men, usually the senior members of _Hongs_ and\r\nofficers of war-ships lying in the harbor, and it was the custom of each\r\nto bring with him his \"boy,\" who stood behind him throughout the repast.\r\n\r\nThere was quite a number of missionaries in the city, and each religious\r\ndenomination provided its ministers with comfortable quarters. The\r\nBaptists were especially well represented and also the \"American Board,\"\r\nwhich was established in Boston in 1812. The English residents had a\r\nsmall chapel of their own which was well sustained by them. There was\r\none missionary who commanded my especial respect and admiration. I refer\r\nto the Rev. Mr. William C. Burns, a Scotch Presbyterian clergyman. He\r\nled a life of consecrated self-denial, living exclusively with the\r\nnatives and dressing in the Chinese garb which, with his Caucasian\r\nfeatures and blond complexion, caused him to present the drollest\r\nappearance. Only those who have resided in China can understand the\r\nrepugnance with which anyone accustomed to the amenities of refined\r\nsociety would naturally regard such a life. He gave up body and soul to\r\nthe spread of Christianity in a heathen land, recalling to my mind the\r\nearly Jesuits, Francis Xavier, Lucas Caballero and Cipriano Baraza, who\r\npenetrated pathless forests and crossed unknown seas in conformity with\r\nthe requirements of their sacred mission. Mr. Burns died in China in the\r\nearnest pursuit of his vocation. I own a copy of his life published in\r\nNew York in 1870, soon after his death.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church was well represented in Foo Chow and was under\r\nthe general direction of the order of the Dominicans. Each portion of\r\nChina, in fact, even the most remote, was under the jurisdiction of\r\nsome Roman Catholic Order, so that directly or indirectly almost every\r\nChinaman in the Empire was reached. The Catholics also had a large\r\norphan asylum in Foo Chow, over whose portals, in Chinese characters,\r\nwas the verse from the Psalms: \"When my father and my mother forsake me,\r\nthen the Lord will take me up.\" Nothing brought back to me my far-away\r\nWestern home more pleasantly than the tones of the Angelus sounding from\r\nthe belfry of this institution.\r\n\r\nThere was a native orphan asylum in Foo Chow, not far from the American\r\nConsulate--a fact I have never seen stated in any of the numerous books\r\nI have read relating to the \"Middle Kingdom.\" With true Chinese insight,\r\nthe largest salary was paid the nurse who successfully reared the\r\ngreatest number of babies. When I lived in China, the laws for the\r\nprevention of infanticide were as stringent as our own, but they were\r\noften successfully evaded. Poverty was so grinding in the East that the\r\nslaughter of children was one of its most pitiable consequences. Infants\r\nwere made way with at birth, before they were regarded with the eye of\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago slavery was prevalent among the Chinese, and one of its\r\nsaddest features consisted in the fact that its victims were of their\r\nown race and color. Poverty-stricken parents sold their offspring to\r\nbrokers, and in Foo Chow it was recognized as a legitimate business.\r\nTheoretically there were no slaves in Hong-Kong, which is British\r\nterritory, but in reality the city was full of them. Both men and women\r\nslave-brokers infested the large cities of China, and boys and girls\r\nbetween the ages of ten and twelve were sent from all the neighboring\r\nvillages to be sold in Foo Chow. The girls were purchased to be employed\r\nas servants, and sometimes parents would buy them for the purpose of\r\ntraining them until they reached the proper age and of then marrying\r\nthem off to their sons. In this way, as may readily be seen, some of\r\nthe young people of China were spared the vicissitudes and\r\ndiscouragements of courtship so keenly realized in some other countries.\r\nI have seen girl slaves sold with no other property except the clothes\r\nupon their backs. Frequently their garments were of the scantiest\r\ncharacter and in some cases even these were claimed by the avaricious\r\nbrokers. Many of the waifs were purchased upon trial as a precaution\r\nagainst leprosy which prevailed throughout the East. One of the tests\r\nconsisted in placing the child in a dark room under a blue light; if the\r\nskin was found to be of a greenish hue, the slave passed muster; but, on\r\nthe other hand, if it was of a reddish tinge it indicated the early\r\nstages of this fatal malady. Babies were not much in demand in Foo Chow\r\nand did not even command the price of fresh pork! I learned at an orphan\r\nasylum in Shanghai that they were purchased at twenty cents each. This\r\ninstitution was conducted by missionaries who taught the girls all kinds\r\nof domestic duties and, when they arrived at proper ages, saw that they\r\nwere given to suitable men for wives.\r\n\r\nNot far from the Consulate were the quarters of the Tartars. They seemed\r\nto live very much to themselves, and most of the men were connected with\r\nthe military service of the country. It may not be generally known that\r\never since the commencement of the Tartar dynasty, between two and three\r\ncenturies ago, the queue has been worn by the Chinese as a badge of\r\nsubmission to the Tartars. The feet of the women were not compressed by\r\nthese early rulers and consequently the Court did not set the fashion as\r\nin European countries. I understand that even now the bandaged feet are\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\nIn those days there were no railroads or telegraphs in China. The\r\nEmperor died while we were living in Foo Chow and the news did not reach\r\nus until several weeks after the event, and then only through the medium\r\nof a courier. The official announcement came to the Consulate upon a\r\nlong yellow card bearing certain Chinese characters. All of the\r\nmandarins in our city, upon receiving the intelligence, gathered at the\r\nvarious temples to bewail in loud tones and with tearful eyes the death\r\nof their ruler.\r\n\r\nThe palace of the Viceroy was naturally the chief objective point of all\r\nforeigners and especially of officials upon their arrival in port.\r\nOccasions frequently occurred when Mr. Gouverneur was compelled to go\r\nthrough the formality of requesting an interview with this high\r\nofficial. These audiences were always promptly granted and were\r\nconducted with a great amount of pomp and ceremony very dear to the\r\ninhabitants of \"far Cathay,\" but exceedingly tiresome to others. Some\r\ndistance from us, and in another quarter of the city, was a large\r\nbuilding called Examination Hall, used by the natives exclusively in\r\nconnection with the civil service of the government. It was divided into\r\nsmall rooms, each of which was large enough to accommodate only one\r\nperson, and in these the young men of that locality who were aspirants\r\nfor governmental positions were locked each year while they wrote their\r\ntest examination papers. The hall accommodated ten thousand students and\r\nthe time of examination was regarded by the Chinese as a critical period\r\nin a young man's life, as his chances of future success largely depended\r\nupon the ability displayed in his papers. These were carefully read by a\r\nboard of examiners, and official positions were assigned to those who\r\nexcelled in the examination. Intelligence was regarded as the chief\r\ncondition of executive favor and, although personal influence naturally\r\nhad its weight, its exercise did not seem to be as prevalent in China as\r\nelsewhere. It may not be flattering to the pride of other nations, but\r\nthe fact remains that the civil service of China was the forerunner of\r\nthe reforms instituted in countries which we are accustomed to regard\r\nas much more enlightened in governmental polity.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in China, the seas were infested with a formidable band of\r\nnative pirates that had committed depredations for many years. One day\r\ntwo rival factions dropped anchor at the same time in the Min River,\r\ndirectly opposite Foo Chow, and opened a brisk fire upon each other.\r\nMany of the foreigners became much alarmed, as projectiles were flying\r\naround at a lively rate. One of these which had entered the house of an\r\nAmerican missionary was brought to the Consulate, and Mr. Gouverneur was\r\nurged to take some action. The natives of China were at times a\r\nturbulent people who seemed glad for an excuse to stir up the community\r\nand, in consequence of this battle of the sea-robbers, a mob formed in\r\nFoo Chow which threatened disastrous results. The only foreign vessel in\r\nthe harbor was a United States man-of-war, the _Adams_, under the\r\ncommand of James F. Schenck, subsequently a Rear Admiral in our Navy.\r\nOnly a few days previous the British ships had departed for the mouth of\r\nthe Peiho River, for the purpose of forcing opium upon the poor Chinese\r\nat the cannon's mouth. The city authorities were requested to use their\r\ninfluence in quelling the riots but seemed unequal to the emergency.\r\nThis state of affairs continued for several days, when one morning the\r\n_Taotai_ (mayor), preceded by men beating gongs and followed by a large\r\nretinue, arrived at the Consulate and requested protection for the city.\r\nUpon a similar occasion during the previous summer, when a number of\r\nBritish warships were in port, these belligerent pirates received\r\nsummary treatment by having their anchor cables cut, thus causing them\r\nto float down the river.\r\n\r\nUpon Mr. Gouverneur's request the _Adams_ sent a detachment of marines\r\non shore. It was quartered around the Consulate and its presence quickly\r\nhad the desired moral effect upon all parties, and proved a source of\r\ngreat relief to both foreign and native residents. Later all\r\napprehension was removed by the speedy departure of the unwelcome\r\nmarauders. Meanwhile the Consulate had received many valuables,\r\ndeposited there for safety. The morning following the departure of the\r\nships we noticed a large number of boxes in our courtyard and also\r\nseveral sheep tied to the flag-staff. For a time we could not understand\r\nthe meaning of this queer collection and were compelled to assign it to\r\nthe usual incomprehensibilities of Chinese life. Mr. Gouverneur went in\r\nsearch of our interpreter, hoping that he could explain the situation,\r\nbut to our surprise he had fled. We learned that he stood in great awe\r\nof the pirates and feared their vengeance if he told all he knew about\r\nthem. Mr. Milne, the British interpreter, finally came to our rescue. It\r\nseems that the sheep and boxes were parting gifts--\"Kumshaws,\" as the\r\nChinese term them--from the pirates to the American and British Consuls\r\nand Mr. Milne.\r\n\r\nAt first we had no idea what the boxes contained, and Mr. Gouverneur\r\nsought the advice of William Sloane, the head of the _Hong_ of Russell\r\nand Company, who had long been a resident of China, as to what should be\r\ndone with this strange consignment. He strongly urged that, as a matter\r\nof policy, they be accepted and the British Consul, Walter H. Medhurst,\r\nagreed with him. The medley collection was accordingly divided into\r\nthree groups and some coolies were engaged to convey to the English\r\nConsul and Mr. Milne their respective shares. The sheep took the lead,\r\nand it was indeed a curious procession that we watched from our windows\r\nas we breathed a sigh of relief over the departure of this\r\n\"embarrassment of riches,\" and commenced to plan for the disposal of our\r\nown share. A few minutes later I chanced to glance out of the window\r\nwhen, to my utter dismay, I saw the procession so recently _en route_ to\r\nthe British Consulate reenter our courtyard. We were informed that\r\nMedhurst had weakened and refused to receive his share of the\r\n\"Kumshaws.\" Mr. Gouverneur was much annoyed by such vacillating conduct\r\nand immediately notified the British Consul in emphatic language that if\r\nhe refused to accept the piratical gifts he would regard it as a\r\npersonal matter. This had the desired effect and a second time the\r\nprocession wended its way to the British Consulate. The boxes proved to\r\ncontain hams, rock candy, dates and other provisions which we\r\nimmediately sent to the American missionaries, while the sheep were\r\ngiven to Mr. Sloane to do with them whatever he pleased. We found this\r\ngentleman throughout our Chinese life to be a man of superior judgment\r\nand an agreeable companion. After a long and successful career in the\r\nEast, he died in China just on the eve of his embarkation for America.\r\nHe never married and many years later I had the pleasure of becoming\r\nacquainted with his brother, Samuel Sloane, the railroad magnate, at\r\nGarrison's-on-the-Hudson; and, owing to our agreeable association with\r\nhis brother, both Mr. and Mrs. Sloane always welcomed me with great\r\ncordiality.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to Commander (afterwards Rear Admiral) James F.\r\nSchenck, U.S.N. Our association with him in Foo Chow was highly\r\nagreeable. He was our frequent guest at the Consulate and we soon\r\ndiscovered in him a man of rare wit; indeed, I have understood that\r\nfifty years ago he was considered the most clever _raconteur_ in the\r\nNavy. Commander Schenck's Executive Officer on the _Adams_ was\r\nLieutenant James J. Waddell, whom we regarded as a pleasing and\r\ncongenial guest. Subsequent to his life in Eastern waters, his career\r\nwas unusually interesting. He was a native of North Carolina and,\r\nresigning his commission in the United States service at the opening of\r\nthe Civil War, subsequently entered the Confederate Navy, where he was\r\nfinally assigned to the command of the celebrated cruiser _Shenandoah_.\r\nThis ship, formerly the British merchantman _Sea King_, was bought in\r\nEngland for £45,000 by James D. Bulloch, the Naval Agent of the Southern\r\nConfederacy in Great Britain, to take the place of the _Alabama_, which\r\nhad been sunk by the _Kearsarge_ in June, 1864. She left London in the\r\nfall of the same year and fitted out as an armed cruiser off Madeira.\r\nShe then went to Australia and, after cruising in various parts of the\r\nPacific, sailed for Behring Sea and the Arctic Ocean, where she met with\r\nremarkable success in her depredations upon Northern shipping. She\r\ncaptured thirty-eight vessels, mostly whalers, and the actual losses\r\ninflicted by her were only sixty thousand dollars less than those\r\ncharged to the _Alabama_. Captain Waddell first heard of the downfall of\r\nthe Confederacy when off the coast of Lower California on the 2d of\r\nAugust, 1865--between three and four months after the event--and, as he\r\nhad captured in that interval about a dozen ships and realized that his\r\nacts might be regarded as piratical, he sailed for England where, early\r\nin November, he surrendered the _Shenandoah_ to the British government.\r\nShe was turned over to the United States, was subsequently sold to the\r\nSultan of Zanzibar and was lost in 1879 in the Indian Ocean. She was the\r\nonly ship that carried the flag of the Confederacy around the world. In\r\nDecember, 1861, Captain Waddell married a daughter of James Iglehart of\r\nAnnapolis, and died in that city a number of years ago.\r\n\r\nThe American Consulate was the rendezvous of all Naval officers who came\r\ninto port, and I recall with gratification Lieutenant John J. B.\r\nWalbach, a son of Colonel John DeBarth Walbach, a well-known officer of\r\nthe Army, Dr. Philip Lansdale, Dr. Benjamin F. Gibbs, Lieutenant George\r\nM. Blodgett and Lieutenant (afterwards Rear Admiral) John C. Beaumont.\r\nThe latter was frequently my guest in Washington after my return to\r\nAmerica, and Doctors Lansdale and Gibbs I met again at the Capital,\r\nwhere we took pleasure in discussing our Chinese observations and\r\nexperiences. While in China I also became acquainted with Captain and\r\nMrs. Eliphalet Nott of Schenectady, the former of whom was a nephew of\r\nthe venerable President Eliphalet Nott of Union College. He commanded\r\nhis own vessel, the _Don Quixote_, and was usually accompanied on his\r\nvoyages by his wife--a mode of life that impressed me as quite ideal.\r\n\r\nOne day as I was passing through the streets of Foo Chow my attention\r\nwas directed to a gayly-dressed woman seated in a chair decked with\r\nflowers. I was informed that she was a Chinese widow who was about to\r\nsacrifice herself upon the pyre in accordance with the custom of the\r\ncountry. I subsequently learned that when this woman reached the place\r\nappointed for the ceremony, she found an immense assemblage, including\r\nmany mandarins and her own brother, the latter of whom had agreed to\r\napply the torch that should launch her into eternity. The crowd,\r\nhowever, was disappointed, for at the last moment her courage failed her\r\nand she announced that she must return home at once as she had forgotten\r\nto feed her pig! The woman's life was saved, but the disappointment of\r\nthe throng found expression in a riot which, however, was speedily\r\nquelled by the authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese nation was the victim of an outrageous wrong, and the\r\nperpetrators were Americans and Englishmen whose unquenchable avarice\r\novercame their moral convictions. I refer to the iniquitous manner in\r\nwhich opium was introduced into the country and subsequently sold to the\r\nnatives. Large fortunes were accumulated in this way, but it was nothing\r\nmore nor less than \"blood money\" wrung from the pockets of those who had\r\na right to expect better things from the representatives of Christian\r\ncountries. China at this time was unable to cope by force with the\r\nWestern nations, but she did not renounce the right to protect herself\r\nfrom this outrage without a struggle. When, however, she asserted this\r\nright, as she did on a certain occasion by seizing and burning the\r\ndeadly drug, she made herself liable for heavy indemnities and was\r\ncompelled to abandon the unequal struggle. In consequence of this act,\r\nsix hundred thousand dollars passed through Mr. Gouverneur's hands as\r\nU.S. Consul. Even in recent years the Chinese Emperor has sought to\r\nprotect his subjects from the evils of opium. When I lived in China,\r\nCongo tea was cultivated around Foo Chow, but in time it was abandoned\r\nand the poppy took its place. A few years ago an edict was issued\r\nprohibiting the cultivation of this flower and I understand that tea is\r\nagain a product of this region. When I resided in Foo Chow, some of the\r\nmost prominent business houses were involved in the smuggling of opium,\r\nand one very large and wealthy firm--that of Jardine and\r\nMatthewson--actually employed a heavily armed gunboat to assist it in\r\nthe accomplishment of this colossal outrage. It will be remembered that\r\nwhen Li Hung Chang, then one of the richest men in the world, visited\r\nthis country a few years ago he frequently asked the wealthy men whom he\r\nmet where they got their money. Whether or not he had in mind at the\r\ntime the manner in which certain American and English fortunes had been\r\naccumulated in his native land does not appear; but if his question had\r\nbeen directed to the heads of some of the business houses in Foo Chow\r\nand elsewhere in China while I was there, it certainly would have\r\nproduced, to say the least, no little embarrassment.\r\n\r\nPoor China has suffered much from the impositions and depredations of\r\nforeigners. Pillage and theft have marked the paths of foreign invaders\r\nin a manner wholly inconsistent with the code of honorable warfare, and\r\nacts have been committed that would never be tolerated in conflicts\r\nbetween Western nations. It was said that the title of Comte de Pelikao\r\nwas conferred by Louis Napoleon upon General Charles Montauban for\r\nhaving presented the Empress Eugénie with some superb black pearls taken\r\nfrom the Imperial Summer Palace when it was looted in 1860. At the same\r\ntime and in the same manner also disappeared many almost priceless gems,\r\ncostly articles of _vertu_, treasures in gold and silver and a wealth of\r\nancient manuscripts; while similar outrages were ruthlessly perpetrated\r\nin the same unfortunate city only a few years ago as the closing chapter\r\nin the Boxer troubles. Unhappy China! She has felt the aggressive hand\r\nof her Western \"brothers\" ever since the unwilling invasion of her\r\nshores.\r\n\r\nAbout this time China was the resort of many adventurous Americans, some\r\nof whom doubtless \"left their country for their country's good,\" with a\r\nview of seeking their fortunes. We became very well acquainted with a\r\nNew Yorker named Augustus Joseph Francis Harrison, a master of a craft\r\nsailing in Chinese waters. His early life had been spent in Morrisania\r\nin New York, where he had become familiar with the name of my husband's\r\nrelative, Gouverneur Morris, and was thus led to seek our acquaintance.\r\nOne day he came to the Consulate apparently in ill health and told us he\r\nwas in a serious condition. It seems that he had employed an English\r\nphysician whose violent remedies had failed to benefit him and had\r\nprompted him to declare that he had been mistaken for a horse! He begged\r\nus for shelter and we accordingly gave him a room and retained him at\r\nthe Consulate as our guest. We knew but little of medical remedies, but\r\nwe did the best for him we could, and in due time were delighted to see\r\nthat our patient was convalescing. One day my husband and my daughter\r\nMaud visited him in his room and, as a token of gratitude, he presented\r\nto the little girl the \"Pirates' God,\" one of his most cherished\r\ntreasures--a curious idol, which is still in her possession. On the back\r\nof it he wrote the following history:--\"This idol, together with the\r\nwhole contents of two large pirate boats, was captured after a severe\r\nfight of three hours, they having undertaken to take us by surprise;\r\nconsequently thirty or forty were killed. The rest made good their\r\nescape by jumping overboard and swimming ashore. The boats and contents,\r\ntoo, were sold.\"\r\n\r\nFoo Chow was a region frequently visited by typhoons, in consequence of\r\nwhich a municipal law required houses to be but one story high. During\r\nthe latter part of our residence in China we experienced the terrors of\r\na storm remarkable for its severity and in the course of which a portion\r\nof the Consulate was blown down. After spending some anxious hours in an\r\nunderground passage in the middle of the night, we were finally obliged\r\nto take refuge in the _Hong_ of Augustus Heard and Company. I shall\r\nnever forget, as we sat in this lonely cellar with the elements raging\r\nabove us, the imploring cries of my young children, \"I want to go home.\"\r\nIt was while this storm was raging that Mr. Gouverneur received the\r\nfollowing note from George J. Weller, the representative of this\r\nwell-known firm:--\r\n\r\n     My dear Mr. Gouverneur,\r\n\r\n     The Barometer is going up--the wind will probably abate a\r\n     little soon, and perhaps then Mrs. G. and the children can\r\n     come. _Make_ the coolies carry the chair. Three can do it.\r\n\r\nThe semi-tropical climate of Foo Chow, however, did not agree with Mr.\r\nGouverneur, in consequence of which we decided to return home. His\r\ncampaign during the Mexican War had made serious inroads upon his\r\nhealth, from which he never entirely recovered. It was hoped that his\r\nlife in the East would be beneficial, but it proved otherwise.\r\nMeanwhile, the Civil War was raging in the United States, but the news\r\nconcerning it was very stale long before it reached us. We did not\r\nreceive the particulars of the battle of Bull Run, for example, until\r\nthree months after its occurrence. In view of the turbulent state of\r\naffairs at home, the government thought it important that Mr. Gouverneur\r\nshould remain at his post of duty until the arrival of his successor,\r\nand he decided to do so. During these days of uncertainty, however, my\r\nhusband deemed it wise that, if possible, I should return with the\r\nchildren on a ship sailing under the protection of the British flag, and\r\nI quite agreed with him. In due time the favorable opportunity presented\r\nitself, and I embarked for America in the British merchantman _Mirage_.\r\nThe wisdom of Mr. Gouverneur's judgment was fully confirmed, as the next\r\nAmerican vessel sailing from Foo Chow after my departure was captured by\r\na Confederate privateer. When I went to China I took two little girls\r\nwith me, and returned with three. At the birth of the last daughter we\r\nnamed her \"Rose de Chine,\" in order to identify her more intimately with\r\nthe land of her nativity. Soon after her birth, several Chinese asked\r\nme: \"How many girls do you keep?\"\r\n\r\nWe were the only passengers on the _Mirage_ and, besides having very\r\nsuperior accommodations on board, we were treated with every\r\nconsideration by its captain. We were three months upon the homeward\r\nvoyage and the captain called it smooth sailing. We fell in with many\r\nvessels _en route_ and, to quote our skipper, we found them \"like human\r\nbeings, some very friendly and others stern and curt.\" When in mid-ocean\r\nwe passed an American vessel, the _Anna Decatur_, which seemed like a\r\nwelcome from home as it was named after a former New York friend of\r\nmine, Anna Pine Decatur, a niece of Commodore Stephen Decatur, who\r\nmarried Captain William H. Parsons of the merchant service. Lieutenant\r\nStephen Decatur, U.S.N., a brother of Anna Pine Decatur, was a constant\r\nvisitor at our house in Houston Street in my young days. During one of\r\nhis cruises he was stricken with a serious illness which resulted in\r\ntotal blindness. He subsequently married but, although he never had the\r\npleasure of seeing his wife and children, his genial nature was not\r\nchanged by his affliction. In 1869 he became a Commodore on the retired\r\nlist, but some of the family connection objected to his use of this\r\ntitle, as in their opinion the world should recognize only one Commodore\r\nStephen Decatur, the naval hero of 1812.\r\n\r\nAs we neared New York harbor I became decidedly impatient and was\r\ncongratulating myself one morning that our long voyage was almost over,\r\nwhen I noticed that the usually pleasant expression on the captain's\r\nface had changed to one of extreme anxiety. I inquired: \"What is wrong,\r\nCaptain?\" and to my dismay he replied: \"Everything!\" He then told me we\r\nwere just outside the pilot grounds, but that in all his experience,\r\neven in Chinese waters, he had never known the barometer to fall so low;\r\nand, to add to his anxiety, there was no pilot within sight! It was a\r\nvery cold February morning, the thermometer having reached the zero\r\nmark, and I went at once to my cabin to prepare for the worst. The\r\ncaptain meanwhile commenced to make preparations for a severe storm, but\r\nbefore we realized it the tempest was upon us and our vessel was blown\r\nfar out to sea, where for three days we were at the mercy of the\r\nelements. The rudder was tied, the hatches battened down and there was\r\nnothing left to do but to sit with folded hands and trust to that\r\nProvidence whom even the waters obey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. GOUVERNEUR'S THREE DAUGHTERS.\r\n\r\n_Miss Gouverneur, Mrs. Roswell Randall Hoes, Mrs. William Crawford\r\nJohnson._]\r\n\r\nI remember sitting in my stateroom one of those terrible nights entirely\r\nalone and without even the comforting sound of a human voice. Our life\r\npreservers were within reach, but I fully realized that they would be of\r\nbut little avail in such a raging sea. During those anxious moments,\r\nwith my little children sound asleep in the adjoining cabin and quite\r\noblivious of impending danger, I wondered whether it would be my destiny\r\nto close my earthly career on Rockaway Beach, near the spot where I had\r\nfirst seen the light of day; but soon after those anxious moments I was\r\nindeed grateful, as the captain told me that if the wind had been in\r\nanother quarter all of us would have perished within a few hours.\r\nGradually the winds and storm ceased and, the waters becoming calmer, we\r\nfinally reached our haven without even being subjected to the annoying\r\npresence of a Custom House official, as the high seas had prevented his\r\nvisit. When I reached land I learned that the awful storm had extended\r\nalong the whole eastern coast and had carried death and devastation in\r\nits track. The children and I were driven to my mother's late residence,\r\n57 West Thirty-sixth Street, but she was no longer there to greet me, as\r\nshe had passed into the Great Beyond the year before my return; but my\r\nsister Charlotte and my brother Malcolm were still living there, both of\r\nwhom were unmarried. I had received such kindness from the captain of\r\nthe _Mirage_ during the homeward voyage that I felt I should like to\r\nmake some fitting return, and accordingly his wife and daughter became\r\nmy guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WAR AND LIFE IN MARYLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the time passed I became somewhat anxious over the delay in Mr.\r\nGouverneur's return to this country. It seems, however, that, with\r\nneither of us knowing it, we were upon the sea at the same time. His\r\nhomeward voyage was made by the way of the Isthmus of Suez and\r\nMarseilles. For a while it seemed difficult for either of us to realize\r\nthat we were in our own country once more, as the Civil War had turned\r\neverything and everybody topsy turvy. When we left the country, party\r\nanimosities were pitched to a high key, but the possibility of a\r\ngigantic civil war as a solution of political problems would have been\r\nregarded as preposterous. On our return, however, the country was wild\r\nwith excitement over an armed struggle, the eventual magnitude of which\r\nno one had yet dreamed of. Newly equipped regiments were constantly\r\npassing in our vicinity for the seat of war, the national ensign and\r\nother emblems of loyalty were displayed on every hand and a martial\r\nspirit pervaded the very atmosphere. The war was the one important topic\r\nof conversation at homes, in the streets and in places of business. The\r\npassions of the people were so thoroughly aroused that they were\r\nfrequently expressed in severe denunciation of any who presumed to\r\nentertain conservative views of the situation of affairs and who still\r\nhoped for conciliation and peace. Suspicions were often created by\r\ntrivial but well-intended acts or remarks that were susceptible of a\r\ndouble construction, and loyal sentiment was often so pronounced in its\r\ndenunciation of the South that no word or remark could be tolerated\r\nthat by any possibility could be construed as a criticism of the\r\nadministration, a disapproval of the war or of any detail relating to\r\nits conduct. For example, not long after our return from China, while\r\nMr. Gouverneur and I were visiting my sister, Mrs. Eames, in Washington,\r\nwe were watching one day a newly equipped regiment from Vermont while\r\npassing her residence _en route_ for the seat of war, when Mr. Eames\r\nremarked, \"Gouverneur, isn't that a fine regiment?\" My husband, who then\r\nand always thereafter was thoroughly loyal to the cause of the Union,\r\nbut whose military training had made him familiar with the precise\r\ntactics and evolutions of regular troops, replied: \"They need training,\"\r\nwhen Mr. Eames, with much warmth of feeling, exclaimed: \"You are a\r\nsecessionist, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThat, however, represented but a mild state of feeling compared with\r\nthat sometimes entertained between those who were loyal to the Union and\r\nothers who sympathized with the South. I recall one conspicuous instance\r\nwhere such antagonistic views resulted in personal animosity that\r\nsevered tender personal relations of long standing. When I left the\r\ncountry a lifelong intimacy had existed between Mrs. Charles Vanden\r\nHeuvel, a granddaughter of Robert Morris, the great financier of the\r\nRevolution, and Mrs. George Gibbs, granddaughter of the Connecticut\r\nstatesman, Oliver Wolcott; but after the outbreak of the war these two\r\nelderly women differed so radically in their views concerning the\r\nconflict that, for a period, their personal relations were severed. The\r\nspirit of toleration was so utterly lacking in both the North and the\r\nSouth that even those allied by ties of blood were estranged, and a\r\nspirit of bitter resentment and crimination everywhere prevailed. This\r\nstate of feeling, under the circumstances, was doubtless inevitable, but\r\nit emphasized better than almost anything else, except bloodshed itself,\r\nthe truth of General Sherman's declaration that \"War is Hell!\"\r\n\r\nThe animosities engendered by the war ruptured family ties and familiar\r\nassociations in Maryland much more completely than in the North. One of\r\nthe Needwood families was that of Outerbridge Horsey, who was a\r\npronounced Southern sympathizer, while not far away at Mount O'Donnell,\r\na superb old estate, lived General Columbus O'Donnell, who ardently\r\nespoused the cause of the Union. Mr. Horsey had a son born just after a\r\nSouthern victory whom he named Robert Victor Lee; but later, after a\r\nConfederate defeat, General O'Donnell suggested that the name be changed\r\nto Robert \"Skedaddle\" Lee, whereupon Mr. Horsey retorted that he thought\r\nthe name of a grandchild of General O'Donnell might appropriately be\r\nchanged to George \"Retreat\" McClellan. Of Charles Oliver O'Donnell, one\r\nof the General's sons, I retain the pleasantest memories. He was a\r\ngentleman of attractive personality and a genial nature. His first wife\r\nwas Lucinia de Sodré, daughter of Luis Pereira de Sodré, who at the time\r\nof his daughter's marriage was the Brazilian Minister in Washington. Mr.\r\nO'Donnell's second wife was Miss Helen Sophia Carroll of Baltimore.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining a few months in New York and a shorter period in\r\nWashington, we visited Mr. Gouverneur's father, who was still living at\r\nNeedwood in Maryland. Here we found a radical change of scene, for we\r\nwere now in close proximity to the seat of war. On our journey southward\r\nwe were somewhat delayed by the rumor that General Lee was about to\r\nenter Maryland, rendering it necessary for us to procure passes, which\r\nwas accomplished through the courtesy of General Edward Shriver, a\r\nnative of Frederick, who held at the time an important official position\r\nin Baltimore. We had thought when we arrived in New York that public\r\nfeeling ran high, but it was mild compared with our observations and\r\nexperiences in Maryland, and we never dared to predict what a day would\r\nbring forth. Mr. Gouverneur's father was a pronounced Northern man, but\r\nhis wife's relatives, as well as most of his neighbors, sympathized with\r\nthe South. Soon after the outbreak of the war, while we were yet in\r\nChina, and at the period when Maryland was wavering between the North\r\nand South, and to anxious spectators secession seemed almost inevitable,\r\nmy father-in-law and ex-Governor Philip F. Thomas left one morning on a\r\nhurried trip to Frederick, where the State Legislature was convened in\r\nspecial session, instead of at the State Capitol in Annapolis, which was\r\nthen occupied by Union troops. A report had reached them that the\r\nlegislature would probably declare for secession and call a convention\r\nto take into consideration an ordinance for the accomplishment of that\r\nend, and they desired to exert whatever influence they could command to\r\nretain the State in the Union. The national administration, however, was\r\nequally alert, and a measure much more effective, in this instance, than\r\nmoral suasion was employed to defeat the adherents of the Southern\r\ncause. General John A. Dix arrested ten members-elect of the State\r\nLegislature, the mayor of Baltimore, a congressman and two editors;\r\nwhile in Frederick, General Nathaniel P. Banks took into custody nine\r\nother members who, under the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus,\r\nwere confined for a time either in Fort Lafayette in New York or in Fort\r\nWarren in Boston. I well remember that one of these was Severn Teackle\r\nWallis of Baltimore, a lawyer of exceptional prominence and ability and\r\na universal favorite in society.\r\n\r\nShortly before the battle of Gettysburg, when Frederick County was\r\noccupied by the Union troops, many of the officers dined at Needwood. A\r\nlittle later, although over forty miles away, we knew that a great\r\nbattle was in progress, as we distinctly heard the steady firing of\r\nheavy artillery. The news of the great Union victory finally reached us\r\nand I listened in silent sympathy to the rejoicing of the Unionists and\r\nheard the lamentations of the sympathizers with the Southern cause.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Gettysburg, the disorganized Southern army came\r\nstraggling along through Maryland, their objective point being Harper's\r\nFerry; while General George G. Meade with his troops was on South\r\nMountain, within sight of the former locality. During the night there\r\narose one of the most violent storms I have ever known, and we naturally\r\nsupposed that it would render the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, which\r\nmeet at Harper's Ferry, absolutely impassable, as all bridges had, of\r\ncourse, been destroyed. The storm raged with such fury that we were\r\nactually afraid to go to bed. Mr. Gouverneur and I were elated because\r\nwe believed it meant the end of hostilities and the Union restored; for\r\nin our opinion, it seemed impossible for human beings to successfully\r\ncontend with the elements and at the same time to live under the fire of\r\nMeade's guns. It would therefore be difficult to describe our surprise\r\nwhen we learned the next morning that Lee's troops had safely crossed\r\nthe Potomac and were again on the soil of Virginia.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later Mr. Gouverneur and I were driving on the national\r\nturnpike, commonly called the Hagerstown pike, when we encountered the\r\nUnion army. Our destination was the country seat of ex-Governor Philip\r\nF. Thomas, two miles from Frederick and within the shadow of Catoctin\r\nmountain, which we were contemplating as a future home. Our travel was\r\nnot impeded except by an occasional inquiry in regard to our political\r\nsentiments, as the Northern army was prone to believe that every\r\nsojourner in Maryland at this time was an adherent of the South. This\r\nnational turnpike, which has been and still is a well-traveled\r\nthoroughfare, was constructed at a cost of several million dollars and\r\nwas generally regarded as an extravagance of John Adams' administration.\r\nIn speaking of this road, which begins at Georgetown, D.C., and crosses\r\nthe mountains into Kentucky, Henry Clay once remarked that no one need\r\ngo abroad for scenery after viewing \"the Valley of the Shenandoah,\r\nHarper's Ferry, and the still more beautiful Middletown valley.\"\r\n\r\nWe were so favorably impressed by the Thomas place that we decided to\r\npurchase it and in a short time found ourselves permanent residents of\r\nFrederick County, in Maryland. We changed the name from \"Waverley\" to\r\n\"_Po-ne-sang_,\" which was the name of a Chinese Mission and meant \"a\r\nsmall hill.\" After seeing the children and myself comfortably\r\nestablished in our new home, Mr. Gouverneur felt that he was now free to\r\ngive his services to the country for which he had so valiantly fought\r\nduring the Mexican War. As he was still in exceedingly delicate health,\r\nactive service in the field with all the exposures of camp life was\r\nentirely out of the question but, desirous of rendering such services as\r\nhe could, he wrote the following letter to Major General Henry W.\r\nHalleck, Commander in Chief of our Army:--\r\n\r\n     On my return from China, where I held the office of Consul\r\n     of the U.S., in the early part of May last I had the honor,\r\n     through the Honorable Secretary of State, to offer my\r\n     services to the President of the United States in any\r\n     capacity in which my military or other experience might\r\n     enable me to serve my country in its present hour of peril.\r\n     To my communication to this effect I have received no reply.\r\n\r\n     I have the honour now to tender to you my services on your\r\n     staff in some position wherein they may prove most\r\n     available.\r\n\r\n     The record of my former services in Mexico is on the files\r\n     of the War Department, and I am without vanity led to\r\n     believe that the historical associations which place my name\r\n     in connection with that of James Monroe may give a prestige\r\n     in our cause not wholly valueless. In conclusion I beg to\r\n     add that the subject of compensation with me would be a\r\n     matter of indifference.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Washington, July 30, 1863.\r\n\r\n     Samuel L. Gouverneur Jr.\r\n     New York.\r\n\r\n     Sir,\r\n\r\n     The law authorizing the appointment of additional aides has\r\n     been repealed. Moreover, I have long since refused to\r\n     nominate except for distinguished or meritorious military\r\n     services. It is true that some have been put upon my staff\r\n     without having rendered any service at all, but they were\r\n     not nominated by me, and I do not recognize their\r\n     appointment as legal.\r\n\r\n          Yours &c.,\r\n\r\n               H. W. HALLECK,\r\n               Major General Commanding.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck seemed to be ignorant of the fact that the chief\r\nrequisite for serving upon his staff was not wanting in the case of my\r\nhusband, who, as before stated, was brevetted for gallantry and\r\nmeritorious conduct at the battles of Contreras and Churubusco in the\r\nMexican War.\r\n\r\nHalleck's reply was a bitter disappointment to Mr. Gouverneur but a\r\ntremendous relief to me, as I knew he was not in the condition of health\r\nto serve even as a staff-officer. When he originally broached the\r\nsubject to me I did not try to dissuade him, as I felt that I had no\r\nmoral right to interfere with his ideas of duty to his country. The\r\nHalleck letter, therefore, brought about a state of affairs in our\r\nhousehold much more satisfactory than my most sanguine anticipations.\r\nMr. Gouverneur, having done his full duty, gave up his idea of\r\nre-entering the Army and, in a spirit of contentment, began to take up\r\nlife in our new home.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of August, 1863, we had just gotten fairly settled\r\nwhen the Confederate guerrilla chieftain, John S. Mosby, appeared at our\r\ndoor with his band of marauders. Their visit was brief and we were\r\nspared the usual depredations--why, we knew not, unless it were owing to\r\nthe fact that Mr. Gouverneur's nephew, James Monroe Heiskell, a mere boy\r\nof sixteen, who ran away from home and swam across the Potomac to join\r\nMosby's band, possibly accompanied him. Mosby's men in the East and\r\nMorgan's rangers in the West represented a species of ignoble warfare.\r\nIn reality they did not benefit the cause which they professed to serve,\r\nbut merely molested inoffensive farmers by carrying off their stock and\r\nthus depriving them of their means of livelihood. In recent years I\r\ndiscussed with a Confederate officer, the late General Beverly\r\nRobertson, Mosby's mode of warfare, and he surprised but gratified me\r\nvery much by saying that in his opinion, it was a great injury to the\r\nSouthern cause. It seems hardly just that, during President Grant's\r\nadministration and later, official positions should have been bestowed\r\nupon Mosby while the interests of other Confederate officers who had\r\nfought a fair and honorable fight and had battled, moreover, for their\r\ncountry during the Mexican War, should have been neglected.\r\n\r\nThese war experiences furnished strenuous days for us in our new home\r\nand we lived in a state of constant excitement. I well recall the first\r\nmorning it was announced to us by one of the colored servants, while we\r\nwere at the breakfast table, that \"the rebels were coming,\" and the\r\nfeeling of timidity that nearly overpowered me. Very soon some troops\r\nunder the command of General Bradley T. Johnson, a native of Frederick,\r\nmarched upon our lawn and encamped all around us. General Johnson\r\nimmediately came to our door and, although I was in anything but a\r\ncomfortable frame of mind, I summoned all my courage and met him at the\r\nthreshold. In a very courtly manner--too much so, in fact, to be\r\nexpected in time of war--he remarked, \"You are a stranger here, madam.\"\r\nI responded: \"My life here has been short; my name is Gouverneur.\" He at\r\nonce said: \"I suppose you are a relative of Mr. Gouverneur of the\r\nMaryland Tract.\" I admitted the fact although I was not quite sure it\r\nwas discreet to do so, as the Union sentiments of my father-in-law were\r\ngenerally well known, and I was talking to a Confederate General. He and\r\nhis officers spent some time with us and we found them exceedingly\r\nfriendly, and thus, at least for a time, the terrors of war were\r\naverted. Many years later I met General Johnson in my own drawing-room\r\nwhen he and his wife came from Baltimore to attend the wedding of my\r\ndaughter, Ruth Monroe, to his cousin, Doctor William Crawford Johnson,\r\nof Frederick. We naturally discussed our first meeting when he was\r\ngreeted with less cordiality than he received during his present visit.\r\n\r\nUpon learning of the approach of the Confederates, we made rapid\r\npreparations for their advent. As we had learned from our neighbors that\r\nthe South stood in great need of horses and we owned a number of them of\r\nmore than usual value, Mr. Gouverneur seized upon an ingenious plan for\r\nconcealing them. Under our house was a fine cellar which, unfortunately,\r\nthe horses refused to enter until the steps leading into it were\r\nremoved. When this had been done, they were led down one by one into a\r\ndarkened room, and bags were securely tied over their eyes to prevent\r\nthem from neighing. During the visit of the Confederates, which seemed\r\nto us interminably long, owing to our anxiety about the horses, General\r\nJohnson sat directly over their hiding place; but they behaved like\r\nwell-bred beasts and never uttered a sound. I had serious misgivings,\r\nhowever, when I saw a mounted officer, riding around the house to make a\r\nsurvey of the premises, stop at the upturned steps. For a moment I\r\nthought all was over and my feelings were akin to those, I fancy, of a\r\nperson secreting stolen goods; but the investigation happily went no\r\nfurther and he rode on.\r\n\r\nWhen the active preparations for hiding the horses were in progress my\r\nchildren were running hither and thither and watching the process with\r\nmuch interest and excitement. I called them to me and in my sternest\r\ntones told them of the near approach of the soldiers and gave them to\r\nunderstand that if they said \"horse\" or \"rebel devil\" in their presence\r\nI should punish them severely. They had been taught by the negroes on\r\nthe place to call the Southerners \"rebel devils,\" and I feared for the\r\nresult if they allowed their childish tongues to wag too freely. A few\r\nhours later I spoke to one of the little girls upon some topic entirely\r\nforeign to our original subject, but she was so overawed by my threat\r\nand the presence of the troops that she seemed afraid to utter a word.\r\nAfter a little encouragement, however, she crept up to my side and\r\nwhispered: \"Mamma, they have taken all of our saddles!\" General Johnson\r\nwas still sitting on our porch, when a soldier approached and asked for\r\nan ax. One was immediately procured, when the General, asking the man's\r\nname, said: \"That ax is to be returned.\" This order struck me as\r\nsomewhat ludicrous when a little later I learned that the ax was to be\r\nused in demolishing all of our fences! This precaution was deemed\r\nimportant in order to facilitate, if necessary, a more speedy retreat.\r\n\r\nAs night approached we were asked if a guard would be acceptable, and we\r\nwere only too glad to avail ourselves of such protection. As we were\r\nclosing the house for the night, after our strenuous day, one of the\r\nsoldiers on guard duty remarked to me, in a friendly voice: \"Now I am\r\ngoing to bed!\" In my astonishment I said: \"Where?\" The smiling response\r\nwas: \"On the porch, to be sure!\" In this state of unrest there was no\r\nrepose for us that night and we did not even attempt to undress, as we\r\nknew not what an hour might bring forth. Just before dawn there was a\r\nknock upon the front door and, upon opening it, I found facing me a\r\nguard who, without any apology, said: \"I left my boots inside!\" Before I\r\nhad locked the front door again and returned to my room, the Southerners\r\nhad \"folded up their tents like the Arabs and as silently stolen away.\"\r\nOnly a short period had elapsed when several mounted officers dashed up\r\nour driveway and anxiously inquired: \"Where are the guards?\" They gave\r\nme only time enough to say, \"They have gone,\" when they rode rapidly\r\naway. We came to the conclusion that they were young men visiting their\r\nrelatives and friends in Frederick and that the retreat was so sudden\r\nthat no word of warning could be sent them.\r\n\r\nWe realized the next day that the hasty departure of the Confederates\r\nwas timely, as the Union Army was encamped all around us. Some of the\r\nofficers came to see us and Mr. Gouverneur invited them to dine. This\r\nwas a period of sudden transitions, for that night the Union Army\r\nretreated and the next day the Confederates were with us again, dining\r\nupon the remnants of the meal left by their adversaries. It was all we\r\nhad to give them, as all our colored servants, having been told that\r\nthey would be captured and taken further South, had fled upon hearing of\r\nthe second visit of the Confederates. This was naturally a trying\r\nexperience for me, as no servant except a Chinese maid was left upon the\r\nplace and I was in a strange locality. But luckily I found the last set\r\nof officers pleasant and congenial and ready to make due allowance for\r\nall household deficiencies. Several of them were natives of Loudoun\r\nCounty, Virginia, and were familiar with our name, as they had lived\r\nnear Oak Hill, the estate of Mr. Gouverneur's grandfather, where my\r\nhusband had passed a portion of his early life. We soon learned that\r\ncountry life during war times without satisfactory servants was much\r\nmore than either Mr. Gouverneur or I had sufficient courage or strength\r\nto bear. This state of affairs resulted in my husband going to New York,\r\nwhere he secured a family of Irish immigrants consisting of a woman and\r\nthree men. The relative positions of the two armies in our general\r\nvicinity had meanwhile shifted several times and we never knew from day\r\nto day whether we were destined to greet friend or foe.\r\n\r\nOn the particular morning of which I am about to speak, the Confederates\r\nwere again with us. They were apparently unacquainted with the\r\ntopography of the surrounding country and were naturally desirous of\r\nsecuring such information as should enable them, in case of necessity,\r\nto effect a speedy and secure retreat. We received an early call from\r\nseveral of their officers who inquired the way to the \"Alms House Road.\"\r\nWe had been so busily engaged in trying to settle ourselves down under\r\nsuch adverse circumstances that we knew actually nothing of the\r\nsurrounding country; and, when Mr. Gouverneur informed our visitors of\r\nthis fact, they looked at one another in such a decidedly incredulous\r\nway as to convince us that they thought we were withholding information.\r\nMy husband finally sent for John Demsey, one of our Irish immigrants,\r\nwho had driven considerably around the adjacent country, and one of the\r\nofficers in a rather offensive manner renewed his query about the \"Alms\r\nHouse Road.\" To our chagrin, John's answer was, \"I do not know;\" and Mr.\r\nGouverneur, realizing that affairs were assuming a rather serious\r\naspect, said: \"John, you do know; tell the officer at once.\" With true\r\nIrish perspicacity he exclaimed: \"Oh, sir, you mean the 'Poor House\r\nroad'--I know that;\" and forthwith gave the desired information. In\r\nanything but pleasant tones the Irish youth was told by the officers to\r\naccompany them as guide, and the order was obeyed with both fear and\r\nalacrity. Mr. Gouverneur then exacted from the commanding officer his\r\nword of honor that the man be permitted to return, and remarked at the\r\nsame time, in an ironical manner, that if they continued to tear down\r\nour fences and commit other depredations we should all of us know the\r\nlocation of the Alms House.\r\n\r\nAt a much later period General Jubal A. Early's Army passed our door _en\r\nroute_, as at least he hoped, for Washington. General John B. Gordon\r\nsent an orderly to our house with his compliments to ask for a map of\r\nFrederick County, which we were unable to supply. All through the day\r\nthe Southern troops continued to march by, until, towards sunset, the\r\nrear of the last column halted in front of our place. As we knew that a\r\nbattle was imminent, we awaited the result with beating hearts and\r\nanxious hopes. When the firing of cannon began we know that the battle\r\nof the Monocacy had begun and were truly grateful that it was four miles\r\naway! The battle was short and decisive and the Southern Army was\r\nrepulsed. The wounded soldiers were conveyed to Frederick, where\r\nhospitals were improvised, and the dead were laid to rest in Mount\r\nOlivet Cemetery, on the outskirts of the city. Both Northern and\r\nSouthern sympathizers became skilled nurses and their gentle\r\nministrations resulted in several instances in romantic attachments.\r\nAmong the young physicians left in Frederick to attend the wounded\r\nsoldiers was Doctor Robert S. Weir, who subsequently became\r\ndistinguished as a surgeon in New York City. While stationed at the\r\nhospital in Frederick, he met a daughter of Robert G. McPherson, whom at\r\nthe conclusion of the war he married. Mrs. McPherson was Miss Milicent\r\nWashington, who was a direct descendant of Colonel Samuel Washington, a\r\nyounger brother of George Washington, and whose five wives are all\r\ninterred in the graveyard at the old family home, Harewood, in Jefferson\r\nCounty, Virginia. Mrs. McPherson, one of whose ancestors was Miss Ann\r\nSteptoe, who married Willoughby Allerton, was also a niece of \"Dolly\"\r\nMadison.\r\n\r\nPrior to the battle of the Monocacy I discovered that our house was\r\nagain surrounded by quite a number of Northern soldiers. This was an\r\nusual occurrence, to be sure, but this time they were making such a\r\ncareful scrutiny of the premises that I was led to inquire of one of\r\nthem what object they had in view. To my utter dismay I was informed\r\nthat as our house was upon a hill they had selected it as \"a position,\"\r\nand that our safest place was in the cellar. We soon realized the wisdom\r\nof this retreat as shells began to fly around us from several directions\r\nand with much rapidity. We spent the greater part of the day\r\nunderground, wondering all the while how long our involuntary\r\nimprisonment would last, as these dark and dismal quarters were\r\nnaturally a great restraint upon the children and exceedingly depressing\r\nto Mr. Gouverneur and myself.\r\n\r\nAlthough Northern in our sentiments, we sometimes preferred the visits\r\nof the Confederates to those of their adversaries, owing to the greater\r\nconsideration which we received from them. Upon the arrival of our own\r\nsoldiers, their first act was to search the house from garret to cellar.\r\nAt first I indignantly inquired their object and was curtly informed\r\nthat they were searching for \"concealed rebels.\" I gradually tolerated\r\nthis mode of procedure until one morning when we were routed up at five\r\no'clock, and then I protested. The Union soldiers took it for granted\r\nthat, owing to the locality of our home, we were Southern sympathizers,\r\nand accordingly at times seemed to do everything in their power to make\r\nus uncomfortable. During those trying days I frequently recalled the\r\nwise saying of Marechal Villars, \"Defend me from my friends, I can\r\ndefend myself from my enemies.\" We noticed, however, a great difference\r\nin the conduct of the various detachments of the Union Army with which\r\nwe came in contact. We always greeted the appearance of the 6th Army\r\nCorps with much enthusiasm. It was composed of stalwart and sturdy\r\nveterans of the regular Army; and I trust its survivors will accept my\r\nhumble tribute of respect and esteem. Very early in the morning of the\r\nday following the departure of some members of this corps from\r\n_Po-ne-sang_ a private appeared at one of our rear doors and inquired\r\nwhen the troops had departed. He had been indulging in a sound sleep\r\nunder one of the broken fences and was wholly unconscious that his\r\ncomrades had moved away. He hesitated for some minutes as to the course\r\nhe should pursue and then hurried off toward Hagerstown. We subsequently\r\nlearned that he was shot at a point not far distant and were impressed\r\nanew by the bloody horrors attending our Civil War.\r\n\r\nGeneral David Hunter made frequent visits to Frederick and his approach\r\nwas regarded with terror by those in sympathy with the Southern cause.\r\nIt was he who performed the unpleasant duty of sending persons suspected\r\nof disloyalty further South, thereby often separating families. Many of\r\nhis victims were elderly people and it is difficult for me at this late\r\nday to describe the amount of distress these orders occasioned. I\r\nremember one case particularly well, that of Dr. John Thomas McGill, a\r\npracticing physician who, together with his wife, was ordered to proceed\r\nimmediately. Mrs. McGill was in very delicate health and the fright\r\ncaused by such summary proceedings, which by the way were not carried\r\nout, tremendous Union influences having been brought to bear, resulted\r\nin death. Many years after the war I attended a supper party at the home\r\nof Judge and Mrs. John Ritchie, when the guests drifted into war\r\nreminiscences. Dr. McGill was present and, as the conversation\r\nprogressed, he was so overcome by his emotion that an apoplectic stroke\r\nwas feared.\r\n\r\nDuring the numerous visits of the Confederate army to Frederick County,\r\nGeneral \"Joe\" Johnston became a great favorite and for some time made\r\nhis headquarters in the city of Frederick. I learned from Colonel\r\nWilliam Richardson, a beloved citizen of that place, that the General\r\nwas especially solicitous concerning the welfare of the men under his\r\ncommand. One day, for example, he found one of his soldiers eating raw\r\npersimmons and at once reproved him for partaking of such unsuitable\r\nfood. The soldier explained that he was adapting his stomach to the\r\ncharacter of his rations. Although we did not see Stonewall Jackson's\r\ntroops pass on their march to Frederick, we were aware of their presence\r\nthere. Barbara Frietchie, whom Whittier has immortalized, lived in a\r\nsmall house on West Patrick Street, adjoining Carroll Creek, but whether\r\nshe ever waved a Union flag as Stonewall Jackson's men were passing is a\r\nquestion concerning which opinions differ. Southern sympathizers deny\r\nit, while persons of Northern sentiments living in Frederick assert that\r\nthe verses of the Quaker poet represent the truth. At any rate, a woman\r\nwith such a name \"lived and moved and had her being\" in that city. She\r\nwas interred in the burying ground of the German Reformed Church, and\r\nfrequently pilgrimages are made to her grave, over which floats a Union\r\nflag not far from where\r\n\r\n    The clustered spires of Frederick stand\r\n    Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.\r\n\r\nI may state, in passing, that it was during the Civil War that the word\r\n\"shoddy\" was coined. It was originally used to designate a class of\r\ninferior goods intended for use in the army from the sale of which many\r\nfortunes were made. Later the word was employed to designate those who\r\nused such goods; and thus, by extension, one heard not only of \"shoddy\r\npeople,\" but also of \"shoddy parties,\" \"shoddy clothes,\" and so on.\r\n\r\nWe heartily shared in the rejoicings of the North when General Lee\r\nsurrendered. In our country home we had lived in an actual condition of\r\ncamp life so long that at its conclusion I remarked to my husband in a\r\njocular vein that I was prepared for a life with the Comanches! We\r\nrestored our damaged fences, dug up our silver which had been buried\r\nmany months under a tree in the garden, and Mr. Gouverneur began to turn\r\nhis attention to agriculture. Our farm was among the finest in Frederick\r\nCounty, which is usually regarded as one of the garden spots of the\r\ncountry. Our social relations had been entirely suspended, as the\r\ndistractions attending the war had kept us so actively employed; but\r\nthat was now a past episode and we began making pleasant acquaintances\r\nfrom Frederick and the surrounding country. Among our first visitors\r\nwere Judge and Mrs. William P. Maulsby; Richard M. Potts and his\r\nbrother, George Potts; Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Trail; the Rev. Dr. and\r\nMrs. George Diehl and their daughter Marie, who in subsequent years\r\nendeared herself to the residents of Frederick; Mrs. John McPherson and\r\nher daughter, Mrs. Worthington Ross; Dr. and Mrs. Fairfax Schley; Judge\r\nand Mrs. John Ritchie; Mr. and Mrs. Jacob M. Kunkel; and the Rev.\r\nMarmaduke Dillon-Lee, an Englishman who had served in the British Army\r\nand at this time was the rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in\r\nFrederick. He had been selected for this pulpit on account of his\r\nneutral political views and we found in him a congenial acquaintance. He\r\nremained in Frederick, however, for only a short period after the war\r\nand was succeeded by the deservedly beloved Rev. Dr. Osborne Ingle, who,\r\nafter a pastorate of nearly half a century, recently passed to his\r\nreward. I can not pass this Godly man by without an encomium to his\r\nmemory. He came to Frederick as a very young man and throughout his long\r\nrectorship he was truly a leader of his flock and, like the \"Good\r\nShepherd of Old,\" the sheep knew him and loved him.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long for Mr. Gouverneur and me to discover that neither\r\nof us was adapted to a country life under the conditions prevailing at\r\nthe close of the War--so very different from those existing in that\r\nlocality at a later period. He knew nothing of practical farming and I\r\nknew nothing of practical cooking. Although I was never entirely without\r\ndomestic service, as I always had with me the Chinese maid whom I had\r\nbrought from the East, we were not fitted, at the best, for such a life.\r\nThe result was that after one winter's experience we made _Po-ne-sang_\r\nonly our summer home. During the trials and tribulations of that distant\r\nwinter I often recalled a remark which Lord Chesterfield is said to have\r\nmade to several persons whom he disliked: \"I wish you were married and\r\nsettled in the country.\" It has even been asserted that, in his\r\nabsentmindedness and excitement incident to encountering an infuriated\r\ncow, he addressed the beast with the same words. This was a favorite\r\nanecdote of General Scott, and it appealed to me then as well as now, as\r\nI regard country life a forlorn fate for all women excepting possibly\r\nthose who are endowed with large wealth with which to gratify every\r\npassing whim.\r\n\r\nThe primitive life we led at _Po-ne-sang_ was full of annoyances and\r\ndiscouragements. For example, we had no running water in our house and\r\nwere supposed to supply ourselves from a cistern in the yard which had\r\ncontracted the bad habit of running dry and for inconvenient periods\r\nremaining so. We were therefore compelled to carry all our water from a\r\nneighbor's spring at least a quarter of a mile away. We tried to remedy\r\nthis defect by boring an artesian well, but all our attempts were\r\nunsuccessful. Country life was distasteful to cooks as they preferred to\r\nlive in a city where they could make and mingle with friends, and I soon\r\nlearned that if I wanted to keep a servant I must hire one who had a\r\nbaby, and that is just what I did. Although country life was distasteful\r\nto her, too, she took her dose of medicine because she could not help\r\nherself as no one else would employ her. Often these babies were a\r\nsource of great care to me, as their mothers would neglect\r\nthem--sometimes from ignorance but more frequently from sheer\r\nindifference. I remember one cook whose baby, owing to the lack of\r\nproper attention, was actually in danger of starving to death. She kept\r\nit in a wooden box under a tree in the garden, and I was obliged at\r\nstated intervals to see that the child was fed.\r\n\r\nDuring our summers at _Po-ne-sang_ our servants made both hard and soft\r\nsoap in a large kettle which swung from an iron tripod in the yard. They\r\nalso made apple and peach butter, a German marmalade that was highly\r\nregarded in that section of the country. The apples or peaches were\r\nallowed to cook slowly all day in a kettle suspended from the tripod and\r\nwere stirred by wooden paddles, whose handles were long enough to enable\r\nthem to be worked at a convenient distance from the fire. In making this\r\nmarmalade, cider was regarded as an important ingredient and the sugar\r\nwas seldom added until the last. Mr. Gouverneur experimented somewhat in\r\nwine making. His success was almost phenomenal and we enjoyed the fruits\r\nof his labor for many years. He used Catawba grapes entirely, which were\r\nbrought to our door in wagon-loads by the country folk who surrounded\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe Maryland mountaineers, as I knew them, were very similar in life and\r\ncharacter to those in North Carolina, of whom more or less has been\r\nwritten the last few years. They had peculiar customs as well as quaint\r\nmodes of action and expression, and invented names for things and\r\nconditions to suit themselves. I remember, for example, that when\r\npersons showed signs of physical illness and the exact nature of their\r\nmaladies was uncertain they were said to have \"the gobacks.\" Frederick\r\nCounty was settled by the early Germans and many of their expressions\r\nare still in vogue. A peach dried whole with the seed retained is\r\ncalled a _hutzel_, and dried apples are _snitz_. In this connection I am\r\nreminded of a German family named House, which resided in Frederick and\r\nconsisted of four maiden sisters. Their means were limited and they eked\r\nout their living by stamping from original designs and taking in plain\r\nsewing. Their front door was always locked and bolted, and to reach the\r\ninmates it was necessary to pass through a gate leading into a long\r\nalley and thence through a scrupulously clean kitchen and up the steep\r\nand narrow back stairs to a small rear room, where sat these four\r\nspinsters. The first one who met you said, \"Good-morning,\" and the\r\nothers repeated the salutation in turn until the last one was reached,\r\nwho simply said, \"Morning.\" This laughable procedure was followed in\r\ntheir subsequent conversation, for one of them had only to lead off with\r\na remark and the others repeated the close of it. It is said that\r\nCrissie, the youngest of the quartette, once had a beau with whom she\r\nsat each night for many years in their prim parlor and that, when he\r\nfinally jilted her, one of her sisters was heard to remark, _àpropos_ of\r\nthe broken engagement: \"Just think of all them candles wasted!\"\r\n\r\nThe second winter of our Maryland life was spent at a hotel in Frederick\r\nwhere we formed a lasting friendship with our fellow boarders, Judge and\r\nMrs. John A. Lynch. With my historical as well as social tastes, I found\r\nthe McPherson household a source of great pleasure and intellectual\r\nprofit to me. I knew Mrs. \"Fanny\" McPherson, as she was invariably\r\ncalled, only as an elderly woman who retained all the graces and charms\r\nof youth. To listen to her tales of bygone days was a pleasure upon\r\nwhich I even yet delight to dwell. She lived to a very great age\r\nsurrounded by her children, her grandchildren and her\r\ngreat-grandchildren, and went to her grave beloved by all. She was the\r\ngranddaughter of Thomas Johnson, the first Governor of Maryland. I\r\nremember reading on one occasion a letter which she took great pride in\r\nshowing me, written to her grandfather by Washington, offering him the\r\nposition of Secretary of State in his cabinet. This flattering offer he\r\ndeclined, but to him is said to belong the honor of having nominated\r\nWashington as Commander in Chief of the Army.\r\n\r\nMrs. McPherson was nearly related to Mrs. John Quincy Adams, who was\r\nLouisa Catharine Johnson of this same Maryland family, and, as she was\r\nan occasional visitor at the White House during her relative's residence\r\nthere, she mingled with many prominent people. I recall a weird story\r\nshe once told me in connection with a daughter of Smith Thompson,\r\nSecretary of the Navy under President Monroe. It seems she married the\r\nViscount Paul Alfred de Bresson, the third Secretary of the French\r\nEmbassy in Washington, and subsequently many elaborate entertainments\r\nwere given in her honor in Washington. She returned with her husband to\r\nEurope and several months later her family received the announcement of\r\nher death. As they had only recently received a letter from her, when\r\napparently she was in the best of health and spirits, they felt somewhat\r\nskeptical and wrote at once for more definite information. A few weeks\r\nlater a package reached them containing her heart preserved in alcohol.\r\nMrs. McPherson's older daughter, Mrs. Worthington Ross, lived with her\r\nmother and ministered with loving hands to her wants in her old age,\r\nwhile the remainder of her life was devoted to unselfish labor in her\r\nMaster's vineyard. Her memory, as well as that of her only child, Fanny\r\nMcPherson Ross, who passed onward and upward before her, is still\r\nrevered in Frederick.\r\n\r\nMr. Gouverneur and I also formed a pleasant acquaintance with Rev. Dr.\r\nJohn McElroy, whose remarkable career in the Catholic Church is well\r\nworthy of notice. Coming to this country as a mere lad, he engaged in\r\nmercantile pursuits in Georgetown, D.C., and when about sixteen years\r\nof age became a lay Jesuit and in 1817 entered the priesthood. After\r\nministering to Trinity church in Georgetown for several years, he was\r\ntransferred, at the request of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, to\r\nFrederick, where he built St. John's church, a college, an academy, an\r\norphan asylum, and the first free school in the city. After remaining\r\nthere for twenty-three years and establishing a reputation for devotion\r\nto his church and rare executive ability that made him one of the most\r\nuseful Jesuits in the country, he was sent back to his old church in\r\nGeorgetown and the following year went to the Mexican War as Chaplain in\r\nthe regiment commanded by Caleb Cushing. During our occasional\r\nconversations it seemed to afford him more than usual pleasure to\r\ndiscuss with me the ability of his distinguished military chief. After\r\nthe war he was sent to Boston, where he became pastor of St. Mary's\r\nchurch, and built the Boston College and the Church of the Immaculate\r\nConception. At the age of ninety, he became blind and retired to the\r\nscene of his early labors in Frederick, where, as the oldest Jesuit in\r\nthe world, he died in the fall of 1877. I remember meeting him one day\r\non the street when he proudly announced that it was his birthday and\r\nthat he was sixty-nine years of age. I knew him to be much older, and my\r\nwords of astonishment evidently revived his senses for, realizing that\r\nhe had reversed his figures, he corrected himself by adding, \"I mean\r\nninety-six.\" At that time he was quite active, considering his extreme\r\nage, and to the close of his life was much respected and beloved by the\r\nresidents of Frederick, irrespective of creed. I attended his funeral\r\nand he was laid to rest in the burying ground of the old Novitiate which\r\nhe founded. It was then that I saw for the first time the grave of Chief\r\nJustice Roger B. Taney. The two-story brick house in Frederick in which\r\nhe lived is still standing, but it would be regarded with contempt by\r\nany of the present Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\nBut how natural, for how changed are the times! In an eloquent address\r\nsubsequent to Taney's death, Charles O'Conor concluded with these words:\r\n\"May the future historian in writing of Judge Roger B. Taney sorrowfully\r\nadd, _Ultimus Romanorum_.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis Scott Key, the author of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" is also\r\nburied in Frederick soil. For many years his remains reposed in an\r\nunnoticed grave in Mount Olivet Cemetery but, through the efforts of the\r\ncitizens of Frederick, and especially of its women, an imposing monument\r\nnow towers above him surmounted by a superb male figure with\r\noutstretched arms. While living in Maryland I frequently met Chief\r\nJustice Salmon P. Chase at the residence of Mrs. Margaret Goldsborough,\r\nand was much impressed by his imposing presence and courtly bearing.\r\nMany years before, he had been a tutor in the Frederick College, which\r\nstill survives and whose walls bear the inscription \"1797.\" Mrs.\r\nGoldsborough was a lifelong resident of Frederick and a woman of a high\r\ndegree of intelligence. Her daughter, Miss Mary Catharine Goldsborough,\r\nI always numbered among my most cherished friends.\r\n\r\nAfter a pleasant sojourn of a number of months in Frederick, we went to\r\nspend the summer at _Po-ne-sang_, where we had the satisfaction of\r\nentertaining quite a number of old friends, among whom was the Hon.\r\nLafayette S. Foster, then Vice-President _pro tempore_ of the United\r\nStates. Maryland was a familiar as well as a cherished State to him, as\r\nin early life he had been a tutor in Centerville on the \"Eastern Shore.\"\r\nMr. Foster's visit was decidedly uneventful to him, as he was there\r\nentirely unheralded and without even a newspaper notice to announce his\r\ncoming and going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nVISIT TO THE FAR SOUTH AND RETURN TO WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the same year I decided to make a long anticipated\r\nvisit to Mrs. John Still Winthrop in Tallahassee, whose marriage in\r\nGramercy Park I had attended so many years ago and which I have already\r\ndescribed. My two younger children accompanied me, but my oldest\r\ndaughter I left behind under her father's protecting care at the Misses\r\nVernon's boarding school in Frederick. This period seemed especially\r\nsuitable for such a long absence, as the whole time and attention of Mr.\r\nGouverneur was engrossed in editing for publication a posthumous work of\r\nJames Monroe, which was subsequently published by the Lippincotts under\r\nthe title, \"The People the Sovereigns.\" We sailed from New York and\r\nstopped _en route_ in Savannah to enable me to see my old friend and\r\nschoolmate, Mrs. William Neyle Habersham. Sherman in his \"March to the\r\nSea\" had passed through Georgia, carrying with him destruction and\r\ndevastation, and the suffering which this and other campaigns of the war\r\nhad brought into the homes of these Southern people it would be\r\ndifficult to describe. The whole South seemed to be shrouded in\r\nmourning, as nearly everyone I met had given up to the \"Lost Cause\" a\r\nhusband or a son, and in some cases both. Two gallant sons of the\r\nHabershams, mere boys, had died upon the same battlefield, and when I\r\nsaw Mr. Habersham for the first time after the war he was so overcome\r\nwith grief that he was obliged to leave the room. Talented to an unusual\r\ndegree and possessing much fortitude, his wife fought bravely for the\r\nsake of her dear ones still spared her, but every now and then her\r\nsorrow asserted itself anew and seemed more than her bleeding soul could\r\nbear. She was especially gifted with her pen, and about ten years after\r\nthe war, while her heart was still wrung with grief, she wrote the\r\nfollowing pathetic lines:--\r\n\r\n     Up above, the Pines make sweet music; sad, plaintive, for\r\n     must there not be a tone of \"infinite sadness\" in all the\r\n     places of Earth's finite gladness? From a spray of jessamine\r\n     I hear the chirp of a little bird--a young beginner; it\r\n     tries over and over again \"its one plain passage of few\r\n     notes\"--the prelude to the full-voice anthem which summer\r\n     will harmonize. Ah! what shades and sunlight! what coloring!\r\n     Green in the grass and trees, blue in the violets and sky,\r\n     gray in the moss, yellow in the jessamines, falling around\r\n     in a perfect Danæan shower of burnished gold! My truant\r\n     fancy sees all this--and more! A dear hand that held mine, a\r\n     \"pure hand,\" a boy's hand, that ere many summers had spread\r\n     out their gorgeous pageantry had drawn the sword for that\r\n     dear summer-land of the jessamine and pine--had drawn the\r\n     sword and dropped it; dropped it from the earnest, vigorous\r\n     clasp of glorious young manhood to lie still and calm,\r\n     life's duty nobly done; ah, a short young life but ... and\r\n     then the other young soldier! for is not my sorrow a twin\r\n     sorrow? Can they be dissevered? In death they were not\r\n     divided. My eyes grow dim. Wipe away the mist, poor mother!\r\n     to see the dear faces of sons and daughters gracing the\r\n     board. Let the blue of the violets breathe to thee rather of\r\n     endless skies and an eternal Heaven, where earth's finite\r\n     sadness is beautified into infinite gladness.\r\n\r\nWe finally reached Tallahassee, where we found the most cordial welcome\r\nawaiting us. Mrs. Winthrop lived in the very heart of the city but our\r\nsurroundings were much more beautiful than I can describe, for the\r\norange trees and hyacinths and jessamine in full bloom and other wealth\r\nof semi-tropical vegetation were suggestive of an earthly Paradise.\r\nSince we last met my hostess had become a widow, but fortunately she and\r\nher only son, who was then just emerging into manhood, had not felt the\r\npersonal vicissitudes of the struggle, as they had taken refuge in the\r\nmountains of North Carolina. Before the war the Winthrops had owned\r\nhundreds of slaves and most of them, in a state of freedom, were still\r\nliving in quarters only a short distance from the house and were working\r\non her plantations just as though the war had not made them free. But\r\nboth among those who suffered from the war and those who escaped its\r\nravages the unfriendly feeling entertained at this time against their\r\nNorthern brethren was naturally intense. I remember that one Sunday\r\nmorning a young son of Mrs. Custis, who with his mother was then an\r\ninmate of the Winthrop household, asked his mother, who had just\r\nreturned from the early service of the Episcopal Church, whether \"the\r\n'Yankees' went up to the same communion table with the Southern people.\"\r\n\r\nDuring my Tallahassee life I made the acquaintance of Madame Achillé\r\nMurat, who lived in an old mansion outside of the city limits. She was\r\nMiss Catharine A. Willis of Virginia, and a great-grandniece of General\r\nWashington. Upon her marriage to Achillé Murat he took her abroad, where\r\nshe was received with much distinction on account of her Washington\r\nblood. Then, too, her marriage into such an illustrious French family\r\nwas an open sesame to the most exclusive circles of society. She was an\r\nelderly woman when I met her, but her conversation abounded with the\r\nmost interesting reminiscences of her life in France. She died in the\r\nsummer of 1867. Achillé Murat was the son of Joachim Murat, the great\r\nMarshal of Napoleon, whose sister Caroline he married and became King of\r\nNaples. Many years later his two sons came to this country. One of them\r\nsettled in Bordentown in New Jersey, and Achillé Murat, after his\r\nmarriage to his Virginia bride, became a resident of Florida. Madame\r\nMurat told me of some of the visits she made to France when the voyage\r\nwas long and tedious. She had many articles of _vertu_ around her, and I\r\nespecially recall a superb marble bust by Canova of her mother-in-law,\r\nQueen Caroline. I expressed surprise at the extreme attractiveness of\r\nthe late Queen, as I had always understood that the Princess Pauline,\r\nNapoleon's other sister, was the family beauty. Madame Murat, however,\r\ntold me I was mistaken and that her royal mother-in-law was, in that\r\nrespect, quite the equal of her sister.\r\n\r\nDuring my acquaintance with Madame Murat, Napoleon III. was on the\r\nthrone of France, and I learned from our many friendly chats that her\r\nrelations with her distinguished kinspeople were of the most cordial\r\ncharacter; and I am informed that for many years the Emperor gave her an\r\nannuity. Hanging in her drawing-room, whose contents were replete with\r\nhistoric association, were two handsome portraits of the Emperor and\r\nEmpress of France, which she called to my attention as recent gifts from\r\nher royal relatives. That prince of hosts, Gouverneur Kemble, once told\r\nme an amusing incident _àpropos_ of Achillé Murat's resourcefulness\r\nunder peculiar difficulties. On one occasion quite a number of foreign\r\nguests appeared at the Frenchman's door and, although Florida is a land\r\n\"flowing with milk and honey,\" he was sorely perplexed to know what\r\nwould be \"toothsome and succulent\" to serve for their repast. Suddenly\r\nan idea flashed upon him. He owned a large flock of sheep and, nothing\r\ndaunted, gave immediate orders to have the tips of their ears cut off.\r\nThese were served in due form, and his guests departed in total\r\nignorance of what they had eaten but fully convinced that America\r\nproduced the choicest of viands.\r\n\r\nUpon one of her numerous visits to France, Madame Murat was accompanied\r\nto the Louvre by Mr. Francis Porteus Corbin, a Virginian whose\r\ncontemporaries proudly asserted was an adornment to any court. While\r\nthey were engaged in viewing the works of art, Madame Murat was joined\r\nby Jerome Bonaparte, to whom she formally presented Mr. Corbin. When the\r\nopportunity arose Bonaparte inquired of his kinswoman who \"the elegant\r\ngentleman\" was. The ready response was: \"Mr. Corbin, of Virginia.\"\r\n\"Well,\" was the ejaculation, \"I had no idea there was so much elegance\r\nin America.\"\r\n\r\nI think these pages will show that all through life I have had a decided\r\nfancy for older men and women. I can hardly account for this taste\r\nexcept by the fact that my predilections have always been of a decidedly\r\nhistorical character. As another instance, I especially enjoyed my\r\nmeeting in the far South with Judge Thomas Randall, who made his home in\r\nTallahassee, but who was originally from Annapolis. He did not allow\r\nadvanced years to interfere with his social tastes, but frequently\r\naccompanied us to parties, where his vivacity rendered him one of the\r\nmost acceptable of guests. Still another elderly gentleman with whom I\r\nhad the pleasure of becoming acquainted during this Southern sojourn was\r\nFrancis Wayles Eppes. He was the son of U.S. Senator John Wayles Eppes,\r\nwhose wife was Maria Jefferson, elder daughter of Thomas Jefferson. He\r\nleft Virginia many years prior to my acquaintance with him and settled\r\nwith several members of the Randolph family in Western Florida when it\r\nwas almost a wilderness.\r\n\r\nI left with keen regret this picturesque land of flowers and stately\r\noaks, but duty called me home, as my husband and little daughter were\r\ngrowing impatient over our long absence. It would seem that the\r\nobservance of timetables differed in those days according to localities\r\nand other circumstances. I was informed that the train I should take\r\nfrom Tallahassee would leave _about_ such and such a time; but upon my\r\ninquiring in Savannah as to whether the ship upon which I proposed to\r\nembark for Baltimore would leave on time, I was explicitly told by its\r\ncaptain that if I were a minute late I should not be one of its\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nAfter my return to Maryland, the home of our adoption, we abandoned the\r\nidea of country life, sold our residence and took up our abode in\r\nFrederick. My children were now reaching an age when education became an\r\nimportant matter and I took advantage of the Frederick Female Seminary,\r\nan institution that has since become a college, as an excellent place to\r\nwhich to send my eldest daughter. It was during this period of\r\ntransition that it was my good fortune to meet for the first time the\r\nwife of the Hon. Henry Gassaway Davis of West Virginia, who was a native\r\nof Frederick and a daughter of Gideon Bantz. Her two older daughters,\r\nHallie, the widow of U.S. Senator Stephen B. Elkins, and Kate, who\r\nsubsequently became the wife of Robert M. G. Brown of the U.S. Navy,\r\nwere boarding pupils at the same school; and Mrs. Davis frequently\r\nvisited them while there. My daughters formed an intimate friendship\r\nwith Mrs. Brown, whom at a later day we often welcomed as a guest in our\r\nWashington home. She has since passed \"over the river,\" having survived\r\nher mother for only a few months, and her memory is hallowed in my\r\nfamily circle. Mrs. Elkins, the promising young girl of so many years\r\nago, is widely known in Washington and elsewhere for her womanly tact,\r\nintelligence and fine presence. Grace, another of Mrs. Davis' daughters,\r\nis now Mrs. Arthur Lee of Washington, but was born after my earlier\r\nacquaintance with her mother in Frederick. Loved and admired, she\r\nresides in Washington surrounded by an exclusive coterie, and devotes\r\nmuch of her time and means to works of philanthropy.\r\n\r\nThe prominent authoress, Mrs. Elizabeth F. Ellet, was repeatedly our\r\nguest while we were living in Frederick. A volume of her poems had\r\nappeared as early as 1835, and she subsequently published quite a number\r\nof books which were highly regarded. When she first came to visit us,\r\nher \"Women of the American Revolution\" had just appeared and her journey\r\nto Maryland was for the purpose of collecting data for a new work which\r\nlater was published under the title of \"The Court Circles of the\r\nRepublic.\" Besides being a gifted writer, Mrs. Ellet had considerable\r\nhistrionic ability, and I have now before me an old newspaper clipping\r\ncontaining an account of an entertainment given by me in her honor when\r\nshe recited from \"Pickwick Papers\", \"Widow Bedott\" and \"The Lost Heir.\"\r\nAnother party at which music and recitations were a prominent feature\r\nwas given to Mrs. Ellet in Frederick by Mrs. Charles E. Trail, a gifted\r\nwoman who thoroughly appreciated intellectual accomplishments wherever\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nMy first acquaintance with the Hon. Joseph Holt, who at the time was\r\nJudge Advocate General of the Army, began in Frederick in 1869. He was a\r\nKentuckian by birth and, after serving for a time as Postmaster General\r\nunder President Buchanan, succeeded, in 1860, John B. Floyd of Virginia\r\nas Secretary of War. He made frequent visits to Frederick where he was\r\nalways the guest of the Rev. Dr. and Mrs. George Diehl. He was a typical\r\nKentuckian, over six feet tall, and in my opinion no one could have\r\nknown him well without being impressed by his intellectual ability.\r\nAfter we returned to Washington to live, in 1873, Judge Holt was a\r\nconstant visitor at our home and I frequently attended handsome\r\nentertainments given in his residence on Capitol Hill. Although I have\r\nbeen in society more or less all of my life, I can say without hesitancy\r\nthat he more perfectly understood and practiced the art of\r\nentertaining--it certainly _is_ an art, and possessed by but few--than\r\nany other person I have ever known. His second wife, who was Miss\r\nMargaret Anderson Wickliffe of Kentucky, had died in 1860 and, as he had\r\nno children, he was living entirely alone.\r\n\r\nFrom my earliest acquaintance with Judge Holt I was deeply impressed by\r\nthe cloud of sadness that seemed to envelop him, and I never learned\r\nuntil I had known him many years and really called him my friend that he\r\nwas laboring under a deep sense of wrong and injustice. Without entering\r\ninto exhaustive details, the main facts are substantially these: In 1865\r\nMr. Holt was Judge Advocate General of the Army and as such was the\r\nprosecuting officer before the Military Commission convened by order of\r\nPresident Johnson for the trial of Mrs. Mary E. Surratt and others for\r\ncomplicity in the assassination of Lincoln. The findings and sentence of\r\nthe Commission were accompanied by a recommendation signed by a majority\r\nof its members in which they \"respectfully pray the President, in\r\nconsideration of the sex and age of the said Mary E. Surratt, if he can,\r\nupon all the facts in the case, find it consistent with his sense of\r\nduty to the country, to commute the sentence of death, which the Court\r\nhave been constrained to pronounce, to imprisonment in the penitentiary\r\nfor life.\" This recommendation for executive clemency remained unknown\r\nto the public until it was incidentally referred to by the Hon. Edwards\r\nPierrepont, counsel for the government in the trial of Mrs. Surratt's\r\nson in 1867. This was followed in subsequent years, and after Andrew\r\nJohnson had ceased to be President, by a controversy in which\r\nreflections were made upon the personal and official integrity of Judge\r\nHolt by the charge that he had never presented the recommendation for\r\nclemency to the President. The matter finally sifted itself down to a\r\nquestion of personal veracity between the ex-President and Judge Holt,\r\nin which the latter affirmed that \"he drew the President's attention\r\nspecially to the recommendation in favor of Mrs. Surratt, which he read\r\nand freely commented on\"; and was contradicted by the ex-President in\r\nthe assertion that \"in acting upon her case no recommendation for a\r\ncommutation of her punishment was mentioned or submitted to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe enemies of Holt accordingly held him indirectly responsible for Mrs.\r\nSurratt's execution, and against such a charge he naturally rebelled\r\nuntil the day of his death. The most cruel feature of the whole affair,\r\nhowever, and the one which probably did more than anything else to\r\nsadden and becloud the remaining days of Judge Holt's life, was the\r\npersonal disloyalty of an eminent citizen of his own State, who had been\r\nhis intimate friend from youth. I refer to James Speed, Andrew Johnson's\r\nAttorney General. In 1883, after most of the prominent actors in the\r\nscene were dead and the animosities caused by the controversy were\r\nlargely allayed--at a time, too, when Holt realized that he was growing\r\nold and recognized more keenly than ever the importance of leaving\r\nbehind a final refutation of the calumnies that had been heaped upon\r\nhim--he appealed to Speed, who, he believed he had reason to assume was\r\nin possession of the exact facts of the case; but all that could be\r\nwrung from him were evasive words to the effect that he saw the petition\r\nfor clemency in the President's office, without intimating whether it\r\nwas before or after Mrs. Surratt's execution, and that he did not \"feel\r\nat liberty to speak of what was said at cabinet meetings.\" An exchange\r\nof letters followed between the two in which Speed excused himself for\r\nsix months on the pleas of bereavement and press of business, and that\r\nhe had lost his glasses, when he finally replied:--\"After very mature\r\nand deliberate consideration, I have come to the conclusion that I\r\ncannot say more than I have said.\" It is no wonder, then, that Holt,\r\ndriven to desperation by such treatment, wrote to Speed:--\"Your\r\nforbearance towards Andrew Johnson, of whose dishonorable conduct you\r\nhave been so well advised, is a great mystery to me. With the stench of\r\nhis baseness in your nostrils you have been all tenderness for him,\r\nwhile for me ... you have been as implacable as fate.\"\r\n\r\nWhile spending the summer of 1888 in Princeton, Massachusetts, I read in\r\nthe _North American Review_ for July of the same year the correspondence\r\nrelating to the Surratt question between Holt and Speed in 1883. Knowing\r\nJudge Holt as I did, having firm faith in his version of the\r\ncontroversy, believing him to be a victim of gross injustice and\r\nrealizing withal how keenly through all these years he had felt the\r\nsting of misrepresentation, I wrote him a lengthy letter. It was not\r\nlong before I received his reply, and I copy it here, as I believe it\r\ncasts an additional sidelight upon a subject which caused this brilliant\r\nand high-minded gentleman bitter suffering from which he never wholly\r\nrecovered. I add several more letters written to me by him which are\r\nbeautiful in expression but pathetic in character.\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON, August 26th, 1888.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. M. Gouverneur,\r\n\r\n     My dear Madam:\r\n\r\n     Your kind letter of the 14th instant was quite a surprise,\r\n     but a very agreeable one I assure you. My reply has been\r\n     thus long delayed from an impression that it would probably\r\n     more certainly reach your hands if addressed to you at\r\n     Frederick.\r\n\r\n     I have read and re-read your letter with increasing\r\n     gratification and thankfulness. Truly am I grateful for the\r\n     friendly spirit that prompted you to make so thorough an\r\n     examination of the Speed correspondence as your _résumé_ of\r\n     it discloses. That _résumé_ is in every way admirable. It\r\n     has the clearness and logical force of a first-class\r\n     lawyer's brief. Indeed, I was on the point of asserting that\r\n     you have a good lawyer's head on your shoulders, but prefer\r\n     saying that you have a head which obeying the inspirations\r\n     of your heart enables you to discern and _appreciate_ the\r\n     truth and extricate it, as well, from the entanglements of\r\n     chicanery and fraud. Be assured, my dear Madam, that I shall\r\n     treasure up your letter fondly, at once as a consolation and\r\n     as a powerful support of the endeavors which I have been\r\n     making for years to rescue my name from the obloquy of an\r\n     accusation, than which nothing falser or fouler ever fell\r\n     from the lips of men or devils.\r\n\r\n     It was a severe shock for my faith in human nature when\r\n     General Speed--with whom I had maintained relations of\r\n     cordial friendship for some fifty years--suddenly allowed\r\n     himself to become a compliant coadjutor of Andrew Johnson in\r\n     his diabolical plot to destroy me. The _rôle_ of suppressing\r\n     the truth, which he voluntarily assumed for himself and in\r\n     which--without explanation or defense--he persisted down to\r\n     his grave, amounted fully to this and to nothing less. Yet\r\n     during all of that time he _knew_ me to be innocent, as well\r\n     as I myself knew and know it, and this he never denied.\r\n     Alas, Alas! what a masquerade is human life, and amid its\r\n     heady currents how rarely do we pause to think of the\r\n     possibilities that lurk under the disguise of its spotless\r\n     reputations!\r\n\r\n     I should be rejoiced to hear that the Summer has strewed\r\n     flowers and only flowers on the paths of your \"outing,\" and\r\n     that you will be able to return to Washington glad of heart\r\n     and reinvigorated for the social duties in which you find\r\n     and bestow so much pleasure. For my own isolated and infirm\r\n     life home was thought to be the best place, and hence I have\r\n     remained here happily finding under my own roof a\r\n     contentment that has left me without envy of those whose\r\n     more fortunate feet have sought the seashore and the\r\n     mountain slopes. You yourself, however, acted wisely and\r\n     well in going away, since the world is still pressing to\r\n     _your_ lips the sparkling cups, which for my own are now but\r\n     a dim, receding memory.\r\n\r\n     I congratulate you on Miss Rose's approaching marriage which\r\n     you have been so good as to announce, and sincerely hope\r\n     that all the bright visions which the coming event must be\r\n     awakening will have an abounding fulfilment. The invitation\r\n     with which you have honored me is accepted with thanks, and\r\n     I shall attend the ceremony with the higher gratification,\r\n     realizing as I shall how closely your own happiness is bound\r\n     up with that of your daughter.[3]\r\n\r\n          Faithfully and gratefully your friend,\r\n\r\n               J. HOLT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON, Nov. 3d, 1888.\r\n\r\n     My dear Mrs. Gouverneur:\r\n\r\n     I am in receipt of your very welcome letter of the 1st\r\n     instant and hasten to send the \"Index\" as requested. Hope it\r\n     may be of service in illustrating and supporting your\r\n     application. I shall preserve the Admiral's [Rear Admiral\r\n     Francis A. Roe, U.S.N.] emphatic words as a cherished\r\n     testimonial. The language of Mrs. Stanard is also very\r\n     grateful to me. Her favorable opinion is the more prized and\r\n     precious because she has known me so long and so well.\r\n\r\n     And now, my dear good friend, how can I sufficiently thank\r\n     you for your generous interest in this trouble of\r\n     mine--which has been a thorn in my life for so many\r\n     years--and for your surpassingly kind offices which have\r\n     been so effectively exercised in connection with it? Be\r\n     assured that while my poor words cannot adequately express\r\n     it, my heart will always throb with gratitude for the tokens\r\n     of good will with which you have so honored and gladdened\r\n     me.\r\n\r\n     I feel much complimented by so early a receipt of the\r\n     invitation to Miss Rose's wedding, and I shall have great\r\n     joy in being present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n               J. HOLT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON, D.C., January 21st, 1891.\r\n\r\n     Dear Mrs. Gouverneur:\r\n\r\n     I regret to be obliged to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\n     welcome letter by the hand of another, owing to the\r\n     condition of my eyes. For many weeks their inflammation has\r\n     prevented me from reading or writing, and I fear that this\r\n     condition will continue for a good while to come. So soon as\r\n     I am able to do so I will either write or have the pleasure\r\n     of calling on you. In the meanwhile believe me most grateful\r\n     for your letter which, however, has been but imperfectly\r\n     read. The darkened chambers of my life never had more need\r\n     than at present of the sunshine which your sympathizing\r\n     letters have always brought me.\r\n\r\n          Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n               J. HOLT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 26th, 1893.\r\n\r\n     Dear Mrs. Gouverneur:\r\n\r\n     Your last two letters have been received and I thank you\r\n     heartily for them. As tokens of your continued friendly\r\n     remembrance they are precious to me. I am much obliged for\r\n     the privilege of reading the letter of Mrs. Vance [Mrs.\r\n     Zebulon B. Vance], which is herewith returned. It is another\r\n     of the many indications I have had of the subtle and wide\r\n     spread circulation given to the Johnson-Speed calumny to\r\n     which you refer. It seems to me that the poison is beyond\r\n     the reach of any human antidote, and that I must look to God\r\n     alone for shelter from it. Your generous and effective good\r\n     offices in this matter, so deeply affecting my reputation\r\n     and happiness, have filled my heart with an enduring\r\n     gratitude.\r\n\r\n     Your unflagging solicitudes, too, for my poor waning life\r\n     have much added to that debt of gratitude, great as it was\r\n     and is. Let the good Lord be praised for ever and ever that\r\n     spirits such as yours have been born into the world.\r\n\r\n     I am obliged to address you in this brief and unsatisfactory\r\n     manner by the hand of another. After two years and a half of\r\n     continued treatment I have as yet received no relief\r\n     whatever, nor do the eminent physicians who have treated me\r\n     afford me any encouragement for the future. While the world\r\n     feasts, it is evident that _my_ lot is and must be _ashes_\r\n     for _bread_.\r\n\r\n     Hoping that you are drinking yourself freely from the\r\n     fountain of happiness you open for others, I remain\r\n\r\n          Very sincerely your friend,\r\n\r\n               J. HOLT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     WASHINGTON, D.C., April 12, 1893.\r\n\r\n     My dear good friend:\r\n\r\n     I regret much to be obliged to communicate with you by the\r\n     hand of another, but my poor life seems to be fixed by fate\r\n     on the down grade, and at present there is no encouragement\r\n     to believe that the future has anything better in store for\r\n     me.\r\n\r\n     I send you a number of the North American Review containing\r\n     the correspondence to which you refer between General Speed\r\n     and myself. In it there is also a detached printed letter of\r\n     Colonel Brown which is important. And I must ask that both\r\n     this letter and the number of the Review be carefully\r\n     preserved and after their perusal by your friend be returned\r\n     to me, as I have no other copies and wish to preserve these.\r\n     I am sorry that the sad circumstances of my condition\r\n     prevent me from thanking you in person for your continued\r\n     interest in my reputation which has been so basely assailed,\r\n     but I trust as triumphantly vindicated.\r\n\r\n     I thank you sincerely for what you have said of Mrs. Kearny.\r\n     It would be a great gratification to me to have an interview\r\n     with her on the long, long ago, but this is a pleasure which\r\n     I now have no encouragement to promise myself.\r\n\r\n     Believe me most grateful for the repeated calls and\r\n     inquiries as to my health which you have been so good as to\r\n     make. Such calls are precious fountains of consolation that\r\n     will not go dry.\r\n\r\n          Very sincerely your friend,\r\n\r\n               J. HOLT.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted upon high authority that after the conviction and\r\nsentence of Mrs. Surratt her daughter Anna, as well as Catholic priests\r\nand prominent men in Washington, attempted to see the President in order\r\nto intercede for executive clemency in her behalf, but were denied\r\nadmission by Preston King, Collector of the Port of New York and then a\r\nguest at the White House, and by U.S. Senator James Lane of Kansas. It\r\nhas also been said that Mrs. Stephen A. Douglas succeeded in reaching\r\nthe President by pushing herself past the guards, but her attempts in\r\nbehalf of the condemned woman were fruitless.\r\n\r\nI knew Preston King very well and his political career interested me\r\ndeeply. He was from St. Lawrence County, New York, and in my girlhood I\r\noften heard it asserted that the mantle of Silas Wright had fallen upon\r\nhim. I saw much of him in 1849 when I was visiting the Scotts in\r\nWashington, and was particularly impressed by his exceptionally\r\nsensitive nature. General Scott once told me that at one period of his\r\nmilitary career he was ordered to quell a disturbance between Canadians\r\nand Americans near Ogdensburg, the home of Mr. King, and that the latter\r\nwas so seriously affected by the scenes he witnessed at that time that\r\nit was long before he recovered his normal condition of mind. During\r\nPresident Johnson's administration Mr. King, while Collector of the Port\r\nof New York, boarded a Jersey City ferry boat one morning, attached\r\nweights to his person and jumped into the river. When the news of his\r\ndeath reached me I was not surprised as I had seen evidences of his\r\nnervous temperament which might well result in acts indicative of an\r\nunbalanced mind. He was a man of big heart and exceptional ability, and\r\nin his death the State of New York lost one of her most gifted and\r\ndistinguished sons.\r\n\r\nThe Frederick County agricultural fairs, as far back as my memory of\r\nthat quaint Maryland town goes, have always been a feature of special\r\ninterest not only to the farmers of that productive region but also from\r\na social point of view. In bygone days some of the most distinguished\r\nmen of the nation made addresses at these \"cattle shows,\" as they were\r\ncalled by the country folk. I recall the visit of President Grant on one\r\nof these occasions when he was the guest of Mrs. Margaret Goldsborough.\r\nHe was accompanied by General Sherman and made a brief address. The\r\nevening of the day these distinguished guests arrived Mrs. Goldsborough\r\ngave a dinner in their honor, which Mr. Gouverneur and I attended. The\r\nentertainment was served in the style then prevalent among old Maryland\r\nfamilies in that vicinity, the _pièces de resistance_ being chicken,\r\nfried to perfection, at one end of the table together with an old ham on\r\nthe opposite end. To these were added \"side trimmings,\" enough to almost\r\nbury the table under their weight. President Grant was then filling his\r\nfirst term as Chief Executive of the nation and, although Mr. Gouverneur\r\nhad known him in Mexico, it was my first glimpse of the distinguished\r\nman. As a whole we were a merry party, but Grant was a reticent guest.\r\nGeneral Sherman, however, as usual made up for all deficiencies in this\r\nline, and as he sat next to me I found him to be a highly agreeable\r\nconversationalist. This dinner party proved a great social success and\r\nat its conclusion a number of prominent citizens called to pay their\r\nrespects to the guests of honor.\r\n\r\nThe next year Horace Greeley was the orator of the day at the Frederick\r\nfair, and it fell to our lot to entertain him. He wrote the following\r\nletter to my husband:--\r\n\r\n     NEW YORK TRIBUNE, New York, Oct. 1, 1871.\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n     I expect to be duly on hand to fulfil my engagement to speak\r\n     at your County Fair and to stop with you, if that shall be\r\n     agreeable to those who have invited me. Will you please see\r\n     Mr. C. H. Keefer who invites me and say to him that I am\r\n     subject to his order and, with his consent, I shall gladly\r\n     accept your invitation.\r\n\r\n          Yours,\r\n\r\n               HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\n     S. L. Gouverneur, Esq.,\r\n     Frederick, Maryland.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Greeley about this time was appearing upon the political horizon\r\nas a prospective presidential candidate, much interest was naturally\r\ncentered in his visit. His appearance was decidedly interesting. He was\r\nof the blond type, past middle life and in dress anything but _à la\r\nmode_. I am no student of physiognomy, but if the question had been\r\nasked I should have said that his most prominent trait of character was\r\nbenevolence. He wore during this memorable visit the characteristic\r\nwhite hat, miniature imitations of which during his presidential\r\ncandidacy became a campaign badge. I am the fortunate possessor of two\r\nof these souvenirs. They are made of white metal and are attached to\r\nbrown ribbons, the color of the latter standing for B. Gratz Brown, the\r\ncandidate for Vice-President upon the Greeley ticket.\r\n\r\nThis visit was the pleasing forerunner of a sincere friendship between\r\nmy husband and Horace Greeley. In our intimate association of a few days\r\nwe recognized as never before his conscientious purpose and intellectual\r\npower, and Mr. Gouverneur was so deeply impressed by his remarkable\r\nability and sterling character that later in the same year he started a\r\nnewspaper in Frederick, which he called _The Maryland Herald_, with a\r\nview of advocating his nomination for the Presidency. My husband had\r\nnever before been especially interested in politics, but he now entered\r\nthe political arena with all the enthusiasm of his intense nature, and,\r\nat a mass meeting in Frederick, was chosen a delegate to the National\r\nLiberal Republican Convention in Cincinnati, which resulted in the\r\nnomination of Greeley and Brown. Although this party was largely\r\ncomposed of Republicans who had become dissatisfied with the Grant\r\nadministration, it will be remembered that its candidates were\r\nsubsequently endorsed by the Democratic party at its convention in\r\nBaltimore, and that the fusion of such hitherto discordant political\r\nelements added exceptional interest to the subsequent campaign. The\r\nvenerable Thomas Jefferson Randolph, grandson of the author of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, although he had reached the advanced age of\r\neighty years, was chosen as the temporary chairman of the Baltimore\r\nConvention. The proceedings of the Cincinnati delegates were replete\r\nwith interest and the enthusiasm was intense. During the uproarious\r\ndemonstration in the convention hall, immediately following Greeley's\r\nnomination, Mr. Gouverneur's friend, John Cochrane of New York, of whom\r\nI have spoken elsewhere, in the excitement of the moment gave expression\r\nto his delight in an Indian war dance, and other usual scenes of boyish\r\nhilarity prevailed.\r\n\r\nMy husband's paper had been the first of the Maryland press, and long\r\nbefore the Convention, to place the name of Greeley at the head of its\r\ncolumns, but others followed, and for a time the movement, both in that\r\nState and elsewhere, appeared to gain strength and to assume formidable\r\nproportions. Subsequent events, however, proved that it would have been\r\nbetter if the newborn babe had been strangled at its birth, as it was\r\ndestined to enjoy but a brief and precarious existence. Although the\r\nmovement commanded the support of the united Democracy and enlisted the\r\nactive sympathies of able men from the Republican ranks--such as Carl\r\nSchurz, Whitelaw Reid, Charles A. Dana, Charles Francis Adams, Lyman\r\nTrumbull, David Davis, Andrew G. Curtin and many more--the voice of the\r\npeople pronounced for Grant, and in the latter part of the same month\r\nthat witnessed his defeat, poor Greeley died of a broken heart!\r\n\r\nGreeley's defeat was a severe blow to Mr. Gouverneur. As the member from\r\nMaryland of the national committee of the Liberal Republican Party, he\r\nhad engaged in the contest with his characteristic ardor, and his\r\nstrenuous but unsuccessful efforts had made inroads upon his health that\r\nhe could but ill afford. Under the circumstances, a change of scene and\r\nemployment seemed highly expedient, and we accordingly decided to break\r\nup our attractive home in Frederick and return to Washington, where so\r\nmuch of Mr. Gouverneur's life had been spent and where I, too, had so\r\nmany pleasant associations. It was in the summer of 1873 that this plan\r\nwas consummated, and we began our second Washington life in a house\r\nwhich we bought on Corcoran Street, near Fourteenth Street. It was one\r\nof a row of dwellings built as an investment by the late George W.\r\nRiggs, the distinguished banker, and was in a portion of the city which\r\nstill abounded in vacant lots. Houses in our vicinity were so widely\r\nscattered that we had an almost uninterrupted view of that part of the\r\nDistrict boundary which is now Florida Avenue. As these were the days of\r\nhorse cars, it was my habit to stand in my vestibule and wait for a car,\r\nas I could see it approaching a long distance off, although we lived\r\nhalf a block from the route, which was on Fourteenth Street. The entire\r\nnorthwestern section of the city, which is now a semi-palatial region,\r\nwas also, at that time, largely a sea of vacant lots. The only house on\r\nDupont Circle was \"Stewart Castle,\" and the fashionable part of the city\r\nwas still that portion below Pennsylvania Avenue, bounded on the east by\r\nSeventeenth Street, although the general trend in the erection of fine\r\nresidences was towards the northwest. Many of the streets were not\r\npaved, but the _régime_ of Alexander R. Shepherd, familiarly called\r\n\"Boss Shepherd,\" changed all of this, and the work of grading commenced.\r\nIt was a trying ordeal for property owners, as it left many houses high\r\nin the air and others below the customary grade, while many from the\r\nranks of the poorer classes, unable to meet the necessary assessments,\r\nwere forced to part with their homes. In the course of several years,\r\nhowever, the situation righted itself. Cellars were dug and English\r\nbasements became prevalent, and it is only occasionally that one now\r\nsees a house far above the level of the street. We sometimes hear the\r\npraises of Mr. Shepherd sung, and without a doubt he made Washington\r\nthe beautiful city it is to-day, but he accomplished it only at a\r\ntremendous cost--the sacrifice of many homes. Next followed the paving\r\nof the streets with wooden blocks; and I was much surprised when they\r\nwere being laid on Fourteenth Street, as I recalled the time during my\r\nearlier days in New York when they were used in paving Broadway, and I\r\nalso well remember how speedily they degenerated and decayed. I was\r\ntold, however, that this form of block was an improvement upon the old\r\nstyle, and was induced to believe it until I saw Fourteenth Street and\r\nPennsylvania Avenue masses of holes and ruts!\r\n\r\nAfter we were fairly settled in our new home I made the pleasing\r\ndiscovery that my next door neighbors were our old acquaintances, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Edmund Pendleton Gaines. Mrs. Gaines was Frances Hogan, a\r\nformer neighbor of ours in Houston Street in New York. William Hogan,\r\nher aged father, was living with her, and their close proximity recalled\r\nmany early memories. He was a gentleman of broad culture and a\r\nproficient linguist, and at an early age had accompanied his father to\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. He formed an intimacy with Lord Byron at Harrow,\r\nwhere he received the early portion of his education. Byron was not then\r\na student but was occupying a small room at Harrow, which he called his\r\n\"den.\" Another of Mr. Hogan's daughters, who is still living, wrote me\r\nthat at this time Lord Byron was a young man and her father a little\r\nboy. She says: \"Lord Byron often admitted my father to his room, when he\r\nwould make him repeat stories of his African life and describe the\r\noccasional appearance of an orang-outang walking through the streets of\r\nCape Town.\" After his father's return to New York, Mr. Hogan attended\r\nColumbia College, from which he was graduated in 1811, and afterwards\r\nstudied law. He subsequently purchased land in the Black River country\r\nand did much to develop that portion of his native State. The town of\r\nHogansburg in Franklin County was named after him. He became a county\r\njudge and member of Congress and later resided in Washington, where he\r\nwas employed in the Department of State, first as an examiner of claims\r\nand then as an official interpreter.\r\n\r\nA short distance from our home and on the same street lived Dr. and Mrs.\r\nAlexander Sharp with their large and interesting family of children, one\r\nof whom, bearing the same name as his father, recently died in\r\nWashington while a Captain in the Navy. Dr. Sharp's wife was a younger\r\nsister of Mrs. U. S. Grant, and her husband was ably filling at the time\r\nthe position of U.S. Marshal of the District of Columbia. A few doors\r\nfrom Mrs. Sharp's lived her sister-in-law, the widow of Louis Dent; and\r\nin the same block, but nearer Thirteenth Street, were the residences of\r\ntwo agreeable Army families, Colonel and Mrs. Almon F. Rockwell and\r\nColonel and Mrs. Asa Bacon Carey, the latter of whom was the niece of\r\nthe late Senator Redfield Proctor of Vermont. I formed a pleasant\r\nfriendship almost immediately with Mrs. Sharp and was always received\r\nwith much cordiality in her home. Corcoran Street, in fact, from a\r\nsocial point of view, proved to be an ideal locality until its\r\ntranquillity was disturbed by the advent of Mr. ---- and family, the\r\nformer of whom was the Washington representative of a prominent New York\r\ndaily paper whose columns had been strongly denunciatory of Grant and\r\nantagonistic to his election, while they abounded in praises of Greeley.\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. ----were persons of much culture, but they were\r\nunfortunate in their selection of a home, as the personal and political\r\nsentiment of the neighborhood was friendly to Grant, while his family\r\nconnections, the Dents and Sharps, residing in that part of the city,\r\nwere deservedly popular. My own position was one of much delicacy.\r\nAlthough I was especially fond of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Sharp, I could not,\r\nin view of Mr. Gouverneur's active interest in the Greeley campaign, be\r\nquite so enthusiastic over the Grant administration as were most of my\r\nneighbors, and, therefore, when I was invited by a mutual friend to call\r\nupon Mrs. ----I had no hesitation in doing so. I was taken to task for\r\nmy act, however, by some of my friends, but I survived the rebuke and am\r\nstill alive to tell the tale. I was told that, several months after the\r\nfamily just referred to was established in its Corcoran Street home,\r\nMrs. ----was returning unaccompanied to her residence one evening, when\r\na colored man, carrying a bucket of mud in one hand and a brush in the\r\nother, ran after her and besmeared her clothing; but the Dents and\r\nGrants were not of the class of people to approve of such a ruffianly\r\nact, nor were any of the other decent residents in the community. If\r\nMrs. Sharp ever had any feeling in connection with my calling upon Mrs.\r\n----, I never knew of it. Our relations were of the most cordial\r\ncharacter from the first, and when her niece, Nellie Grant, was married\r\nto Algernon Sartoris she brought me a box of wedding cake, coupling with\r\nit the remark that she knew of no one more entitled to it than\r\nI--referring, I presume, to the associations connecting the Gouverneur\r\nfamily with the White House. After the close of the Grant\r\nadministration, Dr. Sharp was appointed a paymaster in the Army and for\r\nmany years resided with his family in Yankton, Dakota. I remained in\r\ntouch with Mrs. Sharp, however, and for a long period we kept up an\r\nactive correspondence.\r\n\r\nAt this period Vice-Presidents were not so much _en évidence_ as later,\r\nand Vice-President and Mrs. Schuyler Colfax lived quietly in Washington\r\nand mingled but little in the social world. During his life at the\r\nCapital, Mr. Colfax repeatedly delivered his eloquent oration on\r\nLincoln, which concluded with the lines of N. P. Willis on the death of\r\nPresident William Henry Harrison:--\r\n\r\n    Let us weep in our darkness, but weep not for him--\r\n    Not for him who, departing, leaves millions in tears,\r\n    Not for him who has died full of honor and years,\r\n    Not for him who ascended Fame's ladder so high,\r\n    From the round at the top he has stepped to the sky.\r\n\r\nDirectly back of us on Q Street lived an old and intimate friend of\r\nmine, Mrs. Septimia Randolph Meikleham, the last surviving grandchild of\r\nThomas Jefferson. She was the widow of Dr. David Scott Meikleham of\r\nGlasgow, who was a relative of Sir Walter Scott and died in early life\r\nin New York. Mrs. Meikleham was the seventh daughter (hence her name\r\n\"Septimia,\" suggested by her grandfather) of Governor Thomas Mann\r\nRandolph of Virginia and his wife Martha, the younger daughter of Thomas\r\nJefferson. She was born at Monticello and was familiarly known to her\r\nintimate friends as \"Tim,\" a name in surprising contrast with her\r\nelegance and dignity. She bore a striking resemblance to her\r\ngrandfather, and, although a woman of commanding presence, was simple\r\nand unaffected in manner. Strong in her convictions, attractive in\r\nconversation and loyal in her friendships, she and her home were sources\r\nof great delight to me, and it was pleasing to both of us that her\r\nchildren and mine should have been brought into intimate contact. Mrs.\r\nMeikleham and I often dwelt upon this family intimacy extending unbroken\r\nfrom Jefferson and Monroe down to the fourth generation. In the same\r\nblock with Mrs. Meikleham lived Mr. and Mrs. John W. Douglas, the former\r\nof whom, some years later, during the Harrison administration, was one\r\nof the District Commissioners. A daughter of his is the wife of Henry B.\r\nF. Macfarland, the late Senior Commissioner of the District, who, as\r\nwell as his wife, is universally respected and beloved in Washington. On\r\nthe same street, but on the other side of Fourteenth Street, Colonel and\r\nMrs. Robert N. Scott resided for many years; while just around the\r\ncorner, on Iowa Circle, in what was then a palatial home, lived Allan\r\nMcLane and his only child, Anne, who married from this house John\r\nCropper of New York. She is now a widow but lives in Washington, where\r\nshe is greatly beloved. In this same general region, on the corner of N\r\nand Fourteenth Street, lived Lieutenant Commander (now Rear Admiral) and\r\nMrs. Francis J. Higginson, and the latter's attractive sister, Miss Mary\r\nHaldane.\r\n\r\nNot far from our dwelling on Corcoran Street lived the attractive wife\r\nof _Monsieur_ Grimaud de Caux, _Chancelier_ of the French legation, who\r\nleft unfading memories behind her. During our many delightful chats I\r\nwas much interested in the accounts of her early life and experiences in\r\nIreland, and I especially recall many things she told me concerning the\r\nmembers of the Wilde family, with whom she had been quite intimately\r\nassociated. I learned from her that Oscar Wilde inherited his æsthetic\r\ntastes largely from his mother. She was a woman of unusual type and\r\nhabitually dressed in white--at a time, too, before white garments had\r\nbecome so generally prevalent. I was also told that Oscar Wilde's father\r\nwas an oculist of some prominence, and that he built a mansion so\r\nsingular in its construction that the wits of Dublin called it \"Wilde's\r\neye-sore.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of my intimate friends of those days was Mrs. Mary Donelson\r\nWilcox, widow of the Hon. John A. Wilcox, formerly Secretary of the U.S.\r\nSenate, a Member of Congress and a veteran of the Mexican War. She was a\r\nwoman of rare intellectual ability, and subsequent to her husband's\r\ndeath was for a time one of the official translators of the government.\r\nShe was the daughter of Colonel Andrew Jackson Donelson, a nephew of\r\nPresident Jackson as well as his adopted son and private secretary.\r\nGeneral Jackson when President was a widower, and it was while Mrs.\r\nDonelson was presiding as mistress of the White House that Mrs. Wilcox\r\nwas born. Her memory remained clear until her last illness, and her\r\nrecollections of prominent men and events, extending back to her\r\nchildhood, and especially those of her early life at the White House,\r\nwere of exceptional interest. I was especially amused by her account of\r\nthe prompt manner in which General Jackson sent her mother back to\r\nTennessee because she refused to accord social recognition to the wife\r\nof General John H. Eaton, his Secretary of War. As is well known, this\r\nwas \"Peggy O'Neal\" who, before her marriage to Eaton, was the widow of\r\nPurser John B. Timberlake of our Navy, who committed suicide while\r\nserving in the Mediterranean. The relation which she sustained to the\r\ndisruption of Jackson's cabinet has passed into history and is too well\r\nknown to bear repetition here. As Colonel Donelson shared the views of\r\nhis wife, he resigned his position as the President's private secretary\r\nand returned with her to Tennessee. He was succeeded by Nicholas P.\r\nTrist of the State Department, but a few months later, through the\r\nkindly offices of personal friends, they were both restored to Jackson's\r\nfavor and resumed their former functions in the White House.\r\n\r\nJust across the street from our home lived Mr. and Mrs. Bernard P.\r\nMimmack and the latter's mother, Mrs. Mary Bailey Collins, widow of\r\nCaptain Charles Oliver Collins of the U.S. Army, and a typical\r\nrepresentative of the New York gentlewomen of former days. She was one\r\nof the Bailey family, which was much identified with the history of New\r\nYork, and she and her daughter, Mrs. Mimmack, were valuable additions to\r\nour community. Of Mr. Mimmack, only recently deceased, I can speak only\r\nin terms of the warmest praise. He was a true friend to me and many\r\ntimes during my widowhood placed his ripe judgment and wide experience\r\nat my command.\r\n\r\nAs I first remember Professor and Mrs. Joseph Henry, they were living\r\nwith their three daughters in a portion of the Smithsonian Institution.\r\nHe was a man whose public career and private life commanded universal\r\nrespect, while his scientific discoveries, both at Princeton College and\r\nat the National Capital, marked him as one of the most distinguished men\r\nof his day. I am not qualified to pronounce upon his scholarly\r\nattainments nor upon the estimate in which he is held by the learned\r\nworld of to-day, but it may be assumed that the eulogistic words of the\r\nlate Professor Simon Newcomb, himself a scientific giant, represent the\r\ntruth. \"Professor Joseph Henry, first secretary of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution,\" he wrote, \"was a man of whom it may be said, without any\r\nreflection on men of our generation, that he held a place which has\r\nnever been filled. I do not mean his official place, but his position as\r\nthe recognized leader and exponent of scientific interests at the\r\nNational Capital. A world-wide reputation as a scientific investigator,\r\nexalted character and inspiring presence, broad views of men and things,\r\nthe love and esteem of all, combined to make him the man to whom all who\r\nknew him looked for counsel and guidance in matters affecting the\r\ninterests of science. Whether anyone could since have assumed this\r\nposition, I will not venture to say; but the fact seems to be that no\r\none has been at the same time able and willing to assume it.\"\r\n\r\nThe society circle in Washington in 1873 was small compared with that of\r\nto-day. There was much less form and ceremony, fewer social cliques and\r\na greater degree of affability. The \"Old Washingtonians\" were more _en\r\névidence_ than now and the political element came and went without\r\ndisturbing in any marked degree the harmony of the social atmosphere.\r\nThere were, however, many in public life whose families were cordially\r\nreceived into the most exclusive circles of Washington society and\r\nenriched it by their presence. Mrs. Hamilton Fish held social sway by\r\nthe innate force of character and general attractiveness with which\r\nnature had so lavishly endowed her. Mrs. James G. Blaine, whose husband\r\nwas in Congress when I first knew them, shared in his popularity. Mrs.\r\nGeorge M. Robeson, wife of Grant's Secretary of the Navy, lived on K\r\nStreet and kept open house. The Secretary of the Treasury and Mrs.\r\nWilliam A. Richardson, who lived in the old Hill house on H Street, were\r\nwell known and very popular. Francis Kernan, the junior Senator from New\r\nYork, with his wife and daughter, was seen everywhere. Thomas Kernan,\r\ntheir son, who eventually became a Roman Catholic priest, was a great\r\ndancer and a general favorite. Roscoe Conkling, the senior Senator from\r\nNew York, was socially disposed, but his wife, who was a sister of\r\nHoratio Seymour, although well fitted for social life, took but little\r\npart in it. She was a pronounced blond, wore her hair in many ringlets\r\nand was _petite_ in figure. Senator and Mrs. Henry L. Dawes and their\r\nintellectual daughter, Miss Anna, were highly esteemed by\r\nWashingtonians. General Ambrose B. Burnside, Senator from Rhode Island\r\nand a widower, lived on H Street, where he lavishly entertained his\r\nfriends. Senator Joseph R. Hawley and wife of Connecticut and the\r\nlatter's bright sister, Miss Kate Foote, resided in the Capitol Hill\r\nneighborhood; while Senator Henry B. Anthony, also of Rhode Island and a\r\nwidower, was famous for his grasshopper turkeys, with which he liberally\r\nsupplied his guests at his home on the southwest corner of H and\r\nFourteenth Streets. This was the period when William E. Chandler was\r\nbeginning his prominent and successful political career. He lived with\r\nhis first wife and interesting family of boys on Fourteenth Street below\r\nG Street.\r\n\r\nThe social leader in Washington in 1873 was Mrs. Frances Lawrence\r\nRicketts, whose husband, General James B. Ricketts, U.S.A., had served\r\nhis country during the Civil War and on account of disabilities was\r\nawarded a handsome pension. They lived on G Street between Eighteenth\r\nand Nineteenth Streets and her Friday afternoons were festive\r\noccasions. Mrs. Ricketts was no mean philanthropist in her way and a\r\ncertain wag once wrote--\r\n\r\n    Here comes Mrs. Ricketts\r\n    With a pocketful of tickets.\r\n\r\nThe doggerel had a basis in fact as she frequently appeared in public\r\nwith tickets to sell for the benefit of some charitable object; and she\r\nsold them, too, as but few had the courage to refuse her. She was an\r\nexceedingly fine looking woman with a cordial manner and graceful\r\nbearing. Mrs. Julia A. K. Lawrence, her mother, the widow of John Tharp\r\nLawrence, originally of the Island of Jamaica, lived with her, was quite\r\nas fond of society as the daughter, and, although advanced in years,\r\nseemed to have more friends and admirers than any woman I have ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nOne day by chance I met her in the drawing-room of a mutual friend, Mrs.\r\nSallie Maynadier, where she shocked us by fainting. One of my daughters\r\nwrote her a note of sympathetic inquiry and received in reply the\r\nfollowing answer. I regarded it as a somewhat remarkable note as its\r\nwriter was then approaching her ninetieth birthday.\r\n\r\n     Pray accept my grateful thanks, my dear Miss Gouverneur, for\r\n     your kind attention in writing me such a lovely note. I wish\r\n     I had known you brought it. I would have been so much\r\n     pleased to see you in my room, which I could not leave\r\n     yesterday though very much better. I think the fainting was\r\n     from the heat of Mrs. Maynadier's parlour and the agitation\r\n     of the previous day, at the prospect of parting with my very\r\n     dear friends in the delicate state of dear Kate Eveleth's\r\n     health! I hope to hear to-day how she bore the journey, the\r\n     beautiful day very much in her favor! I can not close this\r\n     note without expressing my sincere wish that your mamma and\r\n     yourself will be so kind as to come and see me during the\r\n     winter. I know that Mrs. Gouverneur does not \"pay visits\"\r\n     but as I can no longer have the pleasure of meeting you at\r\n     our dear friend's I hope she will make an exception in favor\r\n     of such an old woman as myself, one too who has known and\r\n     loved so many of your father's family for generations,\r\n     dating back to President Monroe's family, when I was a child\r\n     in England and used to play often with your grandmamma\r\n     [Maria Hester Monroe]. Can you believe that a vivid memory\r\n     can turn back so many years? Ask your mamma to favour me and\r\n     come yourself to see\r\n\r\n          Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n               JULIA LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\n     1829 G Street,\r\n     Tuesday morning.\r\n\r\nAn old family friend of Mrs. Lawrence and her daughter, the late Dr.\r\nBasil Norris, U.S.A., a native of Frederick, resided in the Ricketts\r\nhome, and I am certain that his memory is still revered in the District.\r\nWhen Mrs. Ricketts, upon her husband's death, broke up her Washington\r\nhome, Dr. Norris went to San Francisco to reside. A daughter of mine on\r\nher way to join her husband in Honolulu was taken seriously ill in that\r\ncity and was attended by him with consummate skill. He was then on the\r\nretired list of the Army, but had a large and fashionable practice in\r\nhis newly adopted home.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Mrs. Lawrence my memory brings vividly before me my\r\nold and valued friends, Mrs. Maynadier, widow of General William\r\nMaynadier of the Ordnance Department of the Army, and her witty sister,\r\nKate Eveleth. To render acts of kindness seemed their natural avocation,\r\nand I never think of them without recalling Sir Walter Scott's\r\ndescription of a ministering angel. I have heard Mrs. Maynadier say that\r\nat the time of her marriage her husband, then a young officer, was\r\nreceiving a salary of only six hundred dollars; and yet she reared a\r\nlarge circle of children, her daughters marrying into prominent families\r\nand her sons becoming professionally well known. Their father was Aide\r\nto General Scott in the Black Hawk War and performed similar duty under\r\nGeneral Alexander Macomb. Their mother lived to see the fourth\r\ngeneration of her descendants, many of whom still reside in the\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Washington, I found the old Decatur house facing\r\nLafayette Square owned and occupied by General and Mrs. Edward F. Beale,\r\nwho had recently returned from a long residence in California. Mr.\r\nGouverneur had known the General--\"Ned\" Beale, as he was usually\r\ncalled--in other days and I soon derived much pleasure from Mrs. Beale's\r\nacquaintance. She was a woman of the most aristocratic bearing and was\r\nespecially qualified to meet the exacting requirements of the most\r\nexclusive society. The household was rendered additionally brilliant by\r\nher two daughters, both of whom were then unmarried. The sparkling\r\nvivacity of the elder, Miss Mary Beale, who subsequently became Madame\r\nBakhmeteff of Russia, is easily recalled; while her sister, now Mrs.\r\nJohn R. McLean, is so well known in Washington and elsewhere as to\r\nrender quite superfluous any attempt to describe her many charming\r\nqualities. Their home was a social rendezvous, and I especially recall\r\nan entertainment I attended there when I met many social celebrities.\r\nGeneral Beale had collected numerous relics of early California which\r\nseemed peculiarly adapted to the historic mansion, and these objects of\r\ninterest, together with the highly polished floors, the many and\r\nbrilliant lights and the large assemblage of society folk in their \"best\r\nbibs and tuckers,\" presented a scene which is not readily effaced from\r\none's memory. Among others I met that evening were General Ambrose E.\r\nBurnside, whom I had known as a cadet at West Point, and my old friend,\r\nCaptain (afterwards General) Richard Tyldin Auchmuty of New York, who\r\nsince I had last seen him had passed through the Civil War. This\r\nreception was given in honor of the then young but gifted tragedian,\r\nJohn E. McCullough, with whom the Beale family had formed a friendship\r\nin the far west.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] My youngest daughter, Rose de Chine Gouverneur, and Chaplain Roswell\r\nRandall Hoes, U.S.N., were married in Washington on the 5th of December,\r\n1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESENT DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after our return to Washington we received an invitation to a\r\nparty at the house of Mr. and Mrs. William A. Richardson, the former\r\nSecretary of the Treasury in Grant's cabinet. In my busy life I have\r\nnever seemed inclined to devote much time to the shifts and vagaries of\r\nfashionable attire. Although as a woman I cannot say that I have been\r\nwholly averse to array myself in attractive garments, they were always\r\nmatters of secondary consideration with me and have yet to cause me a\r\nsleepless night. My indifference now confronted me, however, with the\r\nquery as to what I should wear upon this particular occasion, and I was\r\ncompelled, as merchants say, \"to take account of stock,\" especially as\r\nmy invitation reached me at too late a day to have a new gown made.\r\nAlthough while living in Frederick I did pretty much as I pleased in\r\nregard to dress, I realized that in Washington, willing or unwilling, I\r\nmight be compelled to do, to a certain extent, what other people\r\npleased; but such demands have their reasonable limits, and I therefore\r\ndetermined to ignore the dictates of fashionable sentiment and practice\r\na little originality on my own account. I accordingly decided to wear a\r\nhandsome and elaborate dress of a fashion of at least a generation\r\nbefore--a light, blue silk with its many flounces embroidered in straw\r\nin imitation of sheaves of wheat. In former years I had worn with this\r\ngown black velvet gloves which were laced at the side--a Parisian fancy\r\nof the day, a pattern of which had been sent me by Mrs. Schuyler\r\nHamilton. These also I concluded to wear with the antiquated dress; and\r\nthus arrayed I attended the party and had a thoroughly good time,\r\nsupposing, as a matter of course, that the incident was closed. The _New\r\nYork Graphic_, however, seemed to think otherwise and dragged me into\r\nits columns in an article which was subsequently copied into other\r\npapers. Although at first I felt somewhat chagrined, upon further\r\nconsideration I was inclined to be pleased, at least with that part of\r\nthe narrative that made a passing allusion to my attire. This is what\r\nthe _Graphic_ said:--\r\n\r\n     Among the ladies frequently seen in society this winter is\r\n     Mrs. Marian Campbell Gouverneur, daughter of the late James\r\n     Campbell of New York and the wife of Samuel L. Gouverneur,\r\n     the only surviving grandson of ex-President James Monroe.\r\n     Mrs. Gouverneur is an elegant lady of pleasing manners,\r\n     sparkling vivacity and possesses a fund of humor and a mind\r\n     stored with a variety of charming information. She has\r\n     traveled a great deal and seen much of the fashionable\r\n     world. Mr. Gouverneur's mother was married in the White\r\n     House and--think of it!--on a Spread Eagle--that is to say,\r\n     on the carpet of which that very elastic bird made the\r\n     central figure. Suppose Miss Nellie Grant, of whose\r\n     engagement rumor outside of Washington talks so loud and\r\n     this city appears to know nothing, should take it into her\r\n     head to be married on a Spread Eagle, would not the other\r\n     Eagle, the public, stretch its wings and utter a prolonged\r\n     shriek? Now I ask you candidly, have we retrograded in\r\n     matters of taste or become less loyal to the true spirit of\r\n     our Republican institutions? Mrs. Gouverneur has the most\r\n     wonderful collection of American and Asiatic antiques. She\r\n     favors antique styles, even in matters of the toilet, and at\r\n     a party last week had her dress looped with the ornaments\r\n     which formed part of Mr. Monroe's court dress when Minister\r\n     to France. She also wore black velvet mittens of that date.\r\n\r\nWhile my sister, Mrs. Eames, was residing in Paris with her son and\r\ndaughter, her home on the corner of H and Fourteenth Streets was\r\noccupied by Ward Hunt and his wife of Utica. Judge Hunt had recently\r\nbeen appointed a Justice of the Supreme Court, and I immediately renewed\r\nmy associations of former days with his family. Next door to the Hunts\r\nlived Mr. and Mrs. Titian J. Coffey, the former of whom had accompanied\r\nex-Governor Andrew G. Curtin of Pennsylvania upon his mission to Russia;\r\nand the adjoining residence, the old \"Hill house,\" was the home of Mr.\r\nand Mrs. James C. Kennedy, the latter of whom was Miss Julia Rathbone of\r\nAlbany. Their hospitality was lavish until the death of Mr. Kennedy,\r\nwhen his widow returned to Albany where a few years later she married\r\nBishop Thomas Alfred Starkey of New Jersey. Mrs. Robert Shaw Oliver,\r\nwife of the present efficient Assistant Secretary of War, is her niece.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Kennedy left Washington, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Elkin Neil of\r\nColumbus, Ohio, with their daughter, Mrs. William Wilberforce Williams,\r\nlived in the \"Hill house.\" They were people of large means and\r\nentertained on an extensive scale. Mrs. Neil belonged to the Sullivant\r\nfamily of Ohio whose women were remarkable for their beauty. The wife of\r\nWilliam Dennison, one of the District Commissioners, was Mr. Neil's\r\nsister and her daughter, Miss Jenny Dennison, was one of the belles of\r\nthe Hayes administration. There were so many representatives of the\r\n\"Buckeye State\" at that time in Washington that someone facetiously\r\nspoke of the city as the \"United States of Ohio.\" Mr. and Mrs. Matthew\r\nW. Galt, parents of Mrs. Reginald Fendall, lived in the next house in\r\nthe H Street block, while adjoining them resided Colonel and Mrs. James\r\nG. Berret. I knew Colonel Berret very well. Nature had been very lavish\r\nin her gifts to him, as he was the fortunate possessor of intelligence,\r\nsagacity and fine personal appearance. It was his frequent boast,\r\nhowever, that through force of circumstances he had received but \"three\r\nmonths' schooling,\" but he took advantage of his subsequent\r\nopportunities and became an efficient mayor and postmaster of the City\r\nof Washington, while a prince might well have envied him his dignified\r\nand imposing address. He sold his attractive home to Justice William\r\nStrong of the U.S. Supreme Court, who with his family resided in it for\r\nmany years and then moved into a house on I Street, near Fifteenth\r\nStreet, which in late years has been remodeled and is now the spacious\r\nresidence of Mr. Charles Henry Butler.\r\n\r\nDirectly across the street and in the middle of the block, between\r\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Streets, lived Colonel and Mrs. John F. Lee.\r\nThis is a house which I link with many pleasing associations. Mrs. Lee,\r\nwhom I knew as Ellen Ann Hill, was a member of one of Washington's\r\noldest families and with her husband had a country home in Prince George\r\nCounty in Maryland. She was a deeply religious woman and one of the\r\nsaints upon earth. She gave me _carte blanche_ to drop in for an\r\ninformal supper on Sunday evenings--a privilege of which I occasionally\r\navailed myself. Colonel Lee was a Virginian by birth and a graduate of\r\nWest Point, but at the beginning of the Civil War resigned his\r\ncommission. His brother, Samuel Phillips Lee, however, who was then a\r\nCommander in the Navy, remained in the service and eventually became a\r\nRear Admiral. Although differing so widely in their political views, the\r\ntwo brothers were respected and beloved by their associates, and never\r\nallowed their opinions upon matters of state to interfere with their\r\nfraternal affection. The only daughter of Colonel Lee, Mrs. Henry\r\nHarrison, usually spends her winters in Washington.\r\n\r\nNext door to the Lees on the east lived Senator and Mrs. Zachariah\r\nChandler, the parents of Mrs. Eugene Hale; while still further down the\r\nstreet was the residence of Doctor William P. Johnston, a favorite\r\nphysician of long standing and father of Mr. James M. Johnston and Miss\r\nMary B. Johnston, the latter of whom is President of the Society of Old\r\nWashingtonians of which I enjoy the honor of being a member. It is at\r\nher home on Rhode Island Avenue that the privileged few who are members\r\nof this exclusive organization meet once each month to listen to papers\r\nread on topics relating to earlier Washington and to discuss persons and\r\nevents connected with its history. The insignia of the society is an\r\norange ribbon bearing the words inscribed in black: \"Should auld\r\nacquaintance be forgot?\" A prominent member of this organization is Mrs.\r\nAnna Harris Eastman, widow of Commander Thomas Henderson Eastman,\r\nU.S.N., and daughter of the beloved physician, the late Medical Director\r\nCharles Duval Maxwell, U.S.N.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of many old Washingtonians no history of the District of\r\nColumbia would be complete without some mention of The Highlands, the\r\nhome of the Nourse family. In years gone by I remember that this\r\nivy-covered stone house was deemed inaccessible, as it was reached only\r\nby private conveyance or stage coach. The first time I crossed its\r\nthreshold I could have readily imagined myself living in the colonial\r\nperiod, as the furniture was entirely of that time. When I first knew\r\nMrs. Nourse, who was Miss Rebecca Morris of Philadelphia, the widow of\r\nCharles Josephus Nourse, she was advanced in life, but notwithstanding\r\nthe infirmities of age, she had just acquired the art of china painting,\r\nand was filling orders the proceeds of which she gave in aid of St.\r\nAlban's which was then a country parish. I frequently passed a day at\r\nthis ancestral home, and I especially recall seeing a wonderful\r\nElizabethan clock in the hallway which I am told is still, in defiance\r\nof time, striking the hours in the home of a descendant. Near The\r\nHighlands is Rosedale, occupied for many years by the descendants of\r\nGeneral Uriah Forrest, who built it subsequent to 1782. He was the\r\nintimate friend of General Washington, and its present occupant, Mrs.\r\nLouisa Key Norton, daughter of John Green and widow of John Hatley\r\nNorton of Richmond, is my authority for the statement that one day after\r\ndining with her grandfather, General Forrest, Washington walked out upon\r\nthe portico and, lost in admiration of the beautiful view, exclaimed:\r\n\"There is the site of the Federal City.\" Mrs. Norton's sister, Miss\r\nAlice Green, married Prince Angelo de Yturbide, and it was their son,\r\nPrince Augustine de Yturbide, who was adopted by the Emperor Maximilian.\r\n\r\nOne of the pleasing local features connected with the Grant\r\nadministration, which at the time made no special impression upon me,\r\nwas the fact that there were then but few, if any, social cliques in\r\nWashington, and that society-going people constituted practically one\r\nlarge family. A stranger coming to the Capital at that time and properly\r\nintroduced was much more cordially received than now. Such, for example,\r\nwas the condition of affairs when Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Jeffrey came to\r\nWashington to spend a winter. They rented the old Pleasanton house on\r\nTwenty-first Street below F Street and entertained with true Southern\r\nhospitality. The Jeffrey family was of Scotch extraction and Mrs.\r\nJeffrey was Miss Rosa Vertner of Kentucky, where she was favorably known\r\nas a poetess. The first wife of Alexander Jeffrey was Miss Delia W.\r\nGranger, a sister of my old and valued friend, Mrs. Sanders Irving. As\r\nsoon as they were settled in their home, Mr. and Mrs. Jeffrey gave a\r\nlarge evening entertainment which Mr. Gouverneur and I attended. We much\r\nenjoyed meeting there a number of Kentuckians temporarily residing in\r\nWashington--among others, Mrs. John Key of Georgetown and her sister,\r\nMrs. Hamilton Smith; Mrs. William E. Dudley; and Wickliffe Preston and\r\nhis sister, a decided blonde who wore a becoming green silk gown. Madame\r\nLe Vert and her daughter, Octavia Walton Le Vert, were also there and\r\nit is with genuine pleasure I recall the unusual vivacity of the former.\r\nThis gifted woman was a pronounced belle from Alabama and had passed\r\nmuch of her life in Italy, where she had much association with the\r\nBrownings. During her absence abroad the ravages of our Civil War made\r\nserious inroads upon her financial circumstances, and when she visited\r\nWashington at the period of which I am speaking she gave a series of\r\nlectures upon Mr. and Mrs. Robert Browning in Willard's Hall on F\r\nStreet. They received the endorsement of fashionable society and, at the\r\nconclusion of her last appearance, Albert Pike, the later apostle of\r\nFreemasonry, offered as an additional attraction a short discourse upon\r\nhis favorite theme. Madame Le Vert's maiden name was Octavia Walton, and\r\nshe was the granddaughter of George Walton, one of the Signers from\r\nGeorgia, and the daughter of George Walton, the Territorial Governor of\r\nFlorida. In 1836 she married Dr. Henry S. Le Vert, son of the\r\nfleet-surgeon of the Count de Rochambeau at Yorktown, Va. In 1858 her\r\n\"Souvenirs of Travel\" appeared, and later she wrote \"Souvenirs of\r\nDistinguished People\" and \"Souvenirs of the War,\" but, for personal\r\nreasons, neither of the two was ever published.\r\n\r\nMy first acquaintance with George Bancroft, the historian, dates back to\r\nthe year 1845, when he came from New England to deliver a course of\r\nlectures and was the guest of my father in New York. One of the evenings\r\nhe spent with us stands out in bold relief. He was a man of musical\r\ntastes, and Justine Bibby Onderdonk, a friend of mine and a daughter of\r\nGouverneur S. Bibby, who only a few days before had made a runaway match\r\nwith Henry M. Onderdonk, the son of Bishop Benjamin T. Onderdonk of New\r\nYork, happened to be our guest at the same time. Her musical ability was\r\nof the highest order and she delighted Mr. Bancroft by singing some of\r\nhis favorite selections. Later, when he was Secretary of the Navy\r\nduring the Polk administration, I saw Mr. Bancroft very frequently. I\r\nam not aware whether it is generally known that he began his political\r\nlife in Massachusetts as a Whig. When I first knew him, however, he was\r\na Democrat and the change in his political creed placed him in an\r\nunfavorable light in his State, most of whose citizens were well nigh as\r\nintolerant of Democrats as their ancestors had been of witches in early\r\ncolonial days.\r\n\r\nUpon my return to Washington I soon renewed my acquaintance with Mr. and\r\nMrs. Bancroft, and the entertainments I attended in their home on H\r\nStreet, between Sixteenth and Seventeenth Streets, revived pleasant\r\nrecollections of Mrs. Clement C. Hill, whose house they purchased and of\r\nwhose social leadership I have already spoken. Mr. Bancroft at this time\r\nwas well advanced in years, and in referring to his age I have often\r\nheard him say: \"I came in with the century.\" In spite of the fact,\r\nhowever, that he had exceeded the years usually allotted to man, he\r\ncould be seen nearly every day in the saddle with Herrman Bratz, his\r\ndevoted German attendant, riding at a respectful distance in the rear. I\r\nmay add, by the way, that a few doors from the Bancrofts lived Dr.\r\nGeorge Clymer of the Navy with his wife and venerable mother-in-law, the\r\nlatter of whom was the widow of Commodore William B. Shubrick, U.S.N.\r\n\r\nColonel Alexander Bliss, Mrs. Bancroft's son and familiarly known to\r\nWashingtonians as \"Sandy\" Bliss, lived just around the corner from his\r\nmother's. His wife was the daughter of William T. Albert, of Baltimore,\r\nbut when I knew him best he was a widower. A few doors from Colonel\r\nBliss lived Senator Matthew H. Carpenter, a political power of the first\r\nmagnitude during President Grant's second presidential term, whose\r\ndaughter Lilian was a reigning belle. Equestrian exercise was not then\r\nquite so popular in Washington as later, but it had its devotees, among\r\nwhom was Colonel Joseph C. Audenreid, U.S.A., an unusually handsome man\r\nwith a decidedly military bearing. He was generally accompanied by his\r\ndaughter Florence, then a child, and was often to be seen riding out\r\nFourteenth Street towards the Soldiers' Home, which was then the\r\nfashionable drive.\r\n\r\nJohn L. Cadwalader, a cousin of Mr. Gouverneur and now one of the most\r\nprominent members of the New York bar, was Assistant Secretary of State\r\nunder Hamilton Fish during the Grant _régime_. He was a bachelor and was\r\naccompanied to Washington by his two sisters, both of whom lived with\r\nhim in a fine residence on the corner of L Street and Connecticut\r\nAvenue, which has since been torn down to make way for a large apartment\r\nhouse. It was while the Cadwaladers were occupying this residence that I\r\nfirst made the acquaintance of Dr. S. Weir Mitchell. Miss Mary\r\nCadwalader brought him to see us in our Corcoran Street home and during\r\nthe visit announced her engagement to him. He was then the highly\r\neminent physician alone, as he had not yet entered the arena of fiction\r\nand poetry in which he has since attained such wide-spread distinction.\r\nIt gives me pleasure to add that he suggested to me, while I was\r\nvisiting in Philadelphia many years later, that I should write these\r\nreminiscences.\r\n\r\nAll of the large balls and parties of this date, including the\r\nbachelors' germans, which I frequently attended, were given at Lewis G.\r\nMarini's on the south side of E Street, near Ninth Street. Marini was an\r\nItalian and the dancing master of the day. Twice a week he went to\r\nAnnapolis to teach the midshipmen, who, when subsequently ordered to\r\nduty in Washington, became very acceptable beaux, as they danced the\r\nsame step that their master had taught his pupils here. The bachelors'\r\ngermans were organized among others by Robert F. Stockton, Hamilton\r\nFish, Jr., John Davis, and Hamilton Perkins; while soon thereafter\r\nSeaton Munroe became one of its officers. I especially recall a german\r\ngiven by the bachelors at Marini's, on the twenty-second of February,\r\n1876, when Lady Thornton, wife of Sir Edward Thornton, British Minister\r\nto the United States, received the guests. The decorations were\r\nunusually elaborate, consisting chiefly of American flags draped along\r\nthe walls from floor to ceiling; while at one end of the room, in\r\ncompliment to the hostess of the evening, the stars and stripes made way\r\nto two British flags. A small cannon and a miniature ship were placed\r\nbelow the music gallery, while above them was a semicircle of cutlasses\r\nand a _chevaux-de-frise_ of glistening spears behind which were the\r\nmusicians. In an old scrap book I find a brief notice of this\r\nentertainment which mentions the belles of the ball, some of whom became\r\nmatrons of a later day in Washington and elsewhere. This is the\r\nlist:--Miss Zeilin, Miss Dunn, Miss Kilbourn, Miss Emory, Miss Campbell,\r\nMiss Kernan, Miss Dennison, Miss Keating of Philadelphia, Miss\r\nPatterson, Miss Jewell, Miss Badger, Miss Warfield, Madame Santa Anna,\r\nMrs. Gore Jones, Madame Mariscal, Madame Dardon, Mrs. Belknap, Mrs.\r\nRobeson, Mrs. Frederick Grant and Miss Dodge (\"Gail Hamilton\").\r\n\r\nIn the old Stockton house, next door to the residence of William W.\r\nCorcoran, lived Mr. and Mrs. Elijah Ward who probably entertained more\r\nlavishly than any other family of that day. Mr. Ward was then in\r\nCongress from New York. His wife possessed much grace of manner and a\r\nsubtle charm quite impossible to describe. I enjoyed her intimate\r\nfriendship and often availed myself of a standing invitation to take tea\r\nwith her. In her drawing-room one constantly met acceptable recruits\r\nfrom social and political life, all of whom she charmed by her affable\r\nconversation and unaffected bearing. Upon her return to New York Miss\r\nVirginia Stuart, her daughter by a former marriage, married the Rev.\r\nAlexander McKay-Smith, assistant rector at St. Thomas' Church. Soon\r\nafter his marriage he received a call to St. John's Church in\r\nWashington, where he remained the beloved rector until in 1902 he was\r\nelected Bishop-Coadjutor of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIt was about this same period that I formed a friendship with Lieutenant\r\nCommander and Mrs. Arent Schuyler Crowninshield. He was then Ordnance\r\nOfficer of the Washington Navy Yard and lived in the quaint old house\r\nlater assigned to the second line officer of that station. Mrs.\r\nCrowninshield's sister, Elizabeth Hopkins Bradford, lived with her and I\r\nattended her wedding there. She married Edmund Hamilton Smith of\r\nCanandaigua, New York, a son of Judge James C. Smith of the Supreme\r\nCourt of that State, and the ceremony was performed by the Rev. Dr. John\r\nVaughan Lewis of St. John's Church, Washington. This wedding made an\r\nindelible impression upon my memory owing to an unfortunate circumstance\r\nwhich attended it. The mother of the bride-elect and the latter's\r\nyoungest sister, Louise, were traveling in Europe and had arranged their\r\nreturn passage in ample time, as they supposed, to be present at the\r\nceremony. The ship met with an accident off the coast of Newfoundland,\r\nhowever, and during the delay the wedding took place. There was much\r\nanxiety concerning the safety of the bride's mother and sister which\r\nnaturally cast an atmosphere of gloom over the marriage feast, but in a\r\nfew days the ship came into port and unalloyed happiness prevailed.\r\nAfter Mr. Crowninshield's promotion to a Captaincy in the Navy he was\r\nordered to command the _Richmond_ in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and\r\nthere I repeatedly met him and his fascinating wife. He remained there,\r\nhowever, for less than a year, when he was placed in command of the\r\nill-fated _Maine_, and about ten months before she was destroyed was\r\nordered to Washington as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation with the\r\nrank, first of Commodore and then of Rear Admiral. He served as such\r\nwith marked efficiency during the Spanish-American War, and several\r\nyears later commanded the flagship of the European Squadron. He retired\r\nin 1903 on his own application and died five years later, deeply\r\nregretted by a large circle of official and personal friends. Mrs.\r\nCrowninshield is so well and favorably known to the public as an\r\nauthoress that it would be impossible for me to add any leaves to the\r\nlaurels she now wears; but I cannot refrain from paying a tribute to her\r\nremarkable loyalty as a friend and expressing my admiration for those\r\nuncommon traits of character which, with her commanding presence, have\r\nmade her so deeply respected and so greatly admired.\r\n\r\nThe first loan-exhibition given in Washington that I now recall was near\r\nthe close of Grant's administration, and was for the benefit of the\r\nChurch of the Incarnation. It was in an old house on the corner of\r\nFifteenth and H Streets, since torn down to make way for the George\r\nWashington University. As much interest was shown in the enterprise and\r\nmany of the old Washington families sent valuable relics, a large sum of\r\nmoney was realized. Among the contributors were William W. Corcoran,\r\nMiss Olive Risley Seward, Senator John P. Jones of Nevada, and Seth\r\nLedyard Phelps, the latter of whom was at the time one of the District\r\nCommissioners and owned a large number of Chinese curios gathered by him\r\nduring his life in the East. I, too, was glad to aid so worthy a cause\r\nand sent some of my most cherished possessions. Before the exhibition\r\nwas formally opened, I attended a private view of the collection given\r\nin honor of William W. Corcoran and Horatio King. Of Mr. Corcoran I have\r\nelsewhere spoken; with Mr. King I was also well acquainted. In 1839,\r\nwhile a young man, he was appointed to a position in the Post Office\r\nDepartment and eleven years later was connected with its foreign service\r\nin which he originated and perfected postal arrangements of great\r\nimportance to the country. His promotion was rapid and he finally became\r\nPostmaster General under President Buchanan, a position which he held\r\nwith credit both to the administration and himself. About 1873, when I\r\nfirst knew Mr. and Mrs. King, they lived in a modest home at 707 H\r\nStreet where, every Saturday evening, many _littérateurs_ and prominent\r\nmen of state were accustomed to gather and discuss the important\r\nliterary and political problems of the day. John Pierpont read a poem at\r\nthe first of these receptions and Grace Greenwood rendered some choice\r\nselections, while George William Curtis and other men of note\r\ncontributed their share to the success of other similar occasions. These\r\nliterary reunions are said to have been the first of their kind ever\r\nheld in Washington.\r\n\r\nI was invited one evening in 1877 by Mrs. Madeleine Vinton Dahlgren,\r\nwidow of Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren, U.S.N., who was then living at\r\nthe corner of L and Fourteenth Streets, to attend a meeting of the\r\nWashington Historical Society held in her drawing-rooms. It was\r\nWashington's birthday and James A. Garfield, then Senator from Ohio, was\r\nthe orator of the evening. In one portion of his remarks he seemed to go\r\nout of his way to emphasize the statement that Mary Ball, Washington's\r\nmother, was a very plain old woman. Why he considered that her lack of\r\nprominent lineage necessarily added greater luster to the Father of His\r\nCountry, was not apparent to quite a number of his audience, for even\r\nthe numerous votaries of the Patron Saint of Erin, \"the beautiful isle\r\nof the sea,\" took honest pride in according him a gentle descent:--\r\n\r\n    St. Patrick was a gintleman,\r\n    He came from dacent people.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dahlgren was a woman of unusual intellectual ability. She was the\r\ndaughter of Samuel Finley Vinton of Ohio, who for many years represented\r\nhis district in Congress and was chairman of the Ways and Means\r\nCommittee. In 1879 she published a small volume entitled \"Etiquette of\r\nSocial Life in Washington.\" She followed this book with another, whose\r\ntitle I do not recall, in which she dwelt at length upon society in\r\nWashington. It was not well received as her criticisms upon the wives of\r\nCabinet Officers and others were such as to invoke general disfavor and\r\narouse bitter resentment. Mrs. Dahlgren's ablest work, however, was the\r\nlife of her husband, which was published in 1882 in a volume of over six\r\nhundred and fifty pages. She had a fine command of the English language\r\nand excellent literary discrimination in the use of its words, as\r\nappears everywhere in her writings and especially in the following\r\ntribute to her husband in the preface of his Life:--\r\n\r\n\"Admiral Dahlgren was a man of science, of inventive genius, of\r\nprofessional skill; but beyond all these, he was a _patriot_. While\r\nclimbing, at first with slow and toilsome but reliant steps, and, later\r\non, with swifter, surer progress, that summit to which his genius urged\r\nhim, he was often and again confronted by the clamor of discontent, the\r\njealousies of his profession, and the various forms of opposition his\r\nrapid, upward course evoked; and until the present generation of actors\r\nin the great drama in which he played so conspicuous part shall have\r\npassed away, it will be difficult to gain an impartial opinion. Yet\r\nDeath having arrested his ultimate conceptions while yet midway in his\r\ncareer, and set the final seal upon his actions, we are content to leave\r\nthe verdict of a 'last appeal' to his beloved country and the hearts of\r\na grateful people.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later I attended another meeting of this Historical Society at\r\nthe residence of Henry Strong, who built and owned the house on K Street\r\nnow occupied by Mrs. Stephen B. Elkins, and for a time resided there. It\r\nwas a brilliant assemblage and it deemed itself fortunate in having\r\nMoncure D. Conway, the distinguished historical writer and essayist, as\r\nthe orator of the evening. He spoke upon the leaders of the Federal\r\nparty during the formative period of our national government, and soon\r\nmade it apparent that his sympathies were not with them. He was strongly\r\ndenunciatory of the Federalists, going so far even as to brand some of\r\nthem as traitors, and especially criticized Jay's Treaty with England in\r\n1794 which was their pet creation. He spoke at some length of Oliver\r\nWolcott, one of the most prominent Federalists of that day, entirely\r\nignorant meanwhile of the fact that some members of the Tuckerman\r\nfamily, his descendants, were in the audience. At this time Mr. Conway\r\nwas writing the life of Thomas Paine, which has since been published,\r\nand the morning after his lecture on the Federal party he called upon me\r\nto ascertain whether any unpublished information relating to Paine,\r\nwhich might aid him in his projected biography of the latter, was to be\r\nfound in the private papers of James Monroe which were in my possession.\r\nDuring our conversation I ventured to remark to Mr. Conway that possibly\r\nhe was not aware that the previous evening certain descendants of Oliver\r\nWolcott were in his audience. He responded that he had no desire to give\r\noffense but that unfortunately he could not adapt history to suit the\r\nviews of the descendants of early statesmen.\r\n\r\nTo use a terse expression of Hamlet, I have often heard that Paine was\r\none of the unfortunates who were not treated by our government\r\n\"according to their deserts.\" It is now conceded by students of our\r\nnational history that no man rendered more effective service to the\r\nAmerican Revolution than \"Tom\" Paine. His devotion to the cause and his\r\nconspicuous sacrifices in its behalf were repeatedly acknowledged by\r\nWashington, Franklin and all the lesser lights of the day. After\r\nindependence had been secured, still imbued with the spirit of liberty,\r\nhis pen and his presence were not wanting when required in behalf of\r\nthe liberties of the French people. He was imprisoned with hundreds of\r\nothers in the Luxembourg, where he languished for nearly eleven months\r\nin daily expectation of being hurried to the guillotine. Following the\r\nfall of Robespierre he was liberated through the kindly offices of James\r\nMonroe, who had succeeded Gouverneur Morris as our Minister to France,\r\nand was at once crowned with honors by the government in whose behalf he\r\nhad suffered. During the term of his imprisonment, it was his belief\r\nthat a single word from Washington would effect his release, and he had\r\na right to expect it, but he waited in vain. He was wholly unconscious,\r\nmeanwhile, that the mind of Washington had been poisoned against him by\r\none high in public counsels, and while still in ignorance of this fact\r\naddressed him the well-known denunciatory letter which evoked such\r\nwide-spread criticism. Washington, however, was not to blame, for he had\r\nbeen deceived in the house of his friends; but of this Paine was\r\nentirely ignorant. Delaware Davis, a son of Colonel Samuel B. Davis of\r\nDelaware who rendered such distinguished service during the War of 1812,\r\ntold me a few years ago that his father was present at a dinner where\r\nPaine was asked what he thought of Washington. Doubtless in a spirit of\r\nacrimony he uttered the following lines:\r\n\r\n    Take from the rock the rough and rudest stone,\r\n    It needs no sculptor, it is Washington;\r\n    But if you chisel, let the strokes be rude,\r\n    And on his bosom write ingratitude.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no period of our national history when party rivalries\r\nwere so intense and the expression of political animosities were more\r\nbitter than they were a century ago between the disciples of Jefferson\r\nand Hamilton. Epithets in popular discourse were openly hurled at\r\npolitical antagonists that decent men would not tolerate to-day, and the\r\npublic press gave expression to charges and insinuations against\r\nhonorable partisans such as none but the very yellowest and most\r\ndebauched journals would now deem it expedient to print. As a single\r\nillustration, I have in my possession what is called \"An infallible\r\nremedy to make a true Federalist.\" It is without date and was given to\r\nme by a descendant of Thomas Jefferson who knew nothing of its origin\r\nexcept that it was a Boston production. It speaks for itself, and is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     Take the head of an old hypocrite, one ounce of Nero's\r\n     conspiracy, two ounces of the hatred of truth, five scruples\r\n     of liars' tongues, twenty-five drops of the spirit of Oliver\r\n     Cromwell, fifteen drops of the spirit of contentment. Put\r\n     them in the mortar of self-righteousness and pound them with\r\n     the pestle of malice and sift them through the skin of a\r\n     Doctor of Divinity and put the compound into the vessel of\r\n     rebellion and steep it over the fire of Sedition twenty-four\r\n     hours, and then strain it in the rag of high treason. After\r\n     which put it in the bottle of British influence and cork it\r\n     with the disposition of Toryism, and let it settle until the\r\n     general court rises, and it will then be fit for use. This\r\n     composition has never been known to fail, but if by reason\r\n     of robust constitution it should fail, add the anxiety of\r\n     the stamp act, and sweeten with a Provisional Army.\r\n\r\n     The above articles may be had of the following gentlemen who\r\n     are appointed wholesale venders of British Agents in\r\n     America.\r\n\r\n               F. TARGET.\r\n\r\nThe last days of the Grant administration were filled with forebodings\r\nand excitement. I shall always remember, when the news reached\r\nWashington that Rutherford B. Hayes had been nominated by the Republican\r\nparty, the eager inquiries: \"Who is Hayes?\" It was then I heard for the\r\nfirst time an expression which constantly occurs nowadays--\"A dark\r\nhorse.\" Samuel J. Tilden, as is well known, was the standard bearer of\r\nthe Democracy. The fight was long and bitter, as almost up to the day of\r\nthe inauguration the question as to which candidate was successful was a\r\nmatter of doubt. The Electoral Commission, the compromise agreed upon by\r\nboth parties, was composed of the same number of Republicans and\r\nDemocrats with Justice Joseph P. Bradley of the Supreme Court as the\r\nfifteenth member, chosen on account of his neutral position. It decided\r\nthat the Republican nominee was entitled to the electoral votes of\r\nFlorida, Louisiana and South Carolina, and the Electoral College\r\naccordingly awarded the Presidency to Mr. Hayes by a vote of 186 to 185.\r\n\r\nThe Tilden campaign was engineered by Manton Marble, an able man and the\r\neditor of the New York _World_. I had known Mr. Tilden when he was a\r\ngreat adherent of Martin Van Buren. He was a small, insignificant\r\nlooking man whose whole life was given up to politics. As I remember him\r\nin general, he was expounding upon his favorite subject regardless of\r\n\"time and tide.\" His father had been affiliated with the celebrated\r\n\"Albany Regency,\" and the son, inheriting his views, became one of the\r\nablest as well as shrewdest political leaders that the Democratic party\r\nin New York has ever known. As a lawyer his great ability was\r\nuniversally recognized, and yet his last will was successfully\r\ncontested, although it had been drawn up by him with almost infinite\r\ncare and with the most scrupulous regard for details and engrossed with\r\nhis own hand.\r\n\r\nI saw the Hayes inaugural-parade from a window on the corner of\r\nFifteenth Street and New York Avenue. All through the day there was a\r\nsuppressed feeling of uncertainty and excitement, but at the appointed\r\nhour the President-elect drove to the Capitol in the usual manner and\r\ntook the oath of office. The procession which escorted him to the White\r\nHouse was by no means so imposing as others I had seen, among them that\r\nof eight years later at Cleveland's first inauguration, when General\r\nFitzhugh Lee rode at the head of the Virginia troops and received a\r\ngreater ovation than the new President himself. It was late in February\r\nbefore it was definitely known what the final decision of the Electoral\r\nCommission would be, and the uncertainty arising from this fact,\r\ntogether with the prevailing political disquietude, doubtless had much\r\neffect in limiting the size of the parade.\r\n\r\nI soon made the acquaintance of President and Mrs. Hayes and was always\r\na welcome guest at the White House. The latter was of commanding\r\npresence and endowed with great beauty, while she possessed moral and\r\nintellectual traits that not only endeared her in time to the residents\r\nof the Capital but also won for her the respect and admiration of the\r\npeople at large. She was also a woman of strong convictions and\r\nexceptional strength of character, and rarely failed to make her\r\ninfluence felt in behalf of what she believed to be right. Although, for\r\nexample, the attitude she assumed in regard to the use of wine at the\r\nWhite House entertainments was a radical departure from precedent and\r\nevoked the antagonism of many of her friends and admirers, she believed\r\nherself to be right and successfully persevered in her course to the\r\nend; so that William M. Evarts, Hayes's Secretary of State, kept pretty\r\nclose to the truth when he asserted years thereafter that \"during the\r\nHayes administration water flowed at the White House like champagne!\"\r\nShe was a woman of deeply religious experience and a devout member of\r\nthe Methodist Church. Washington society felt the influence of her\r\nexample, and during her residence at the White House the Sabbath was\r\nmore generally observed at the National Capital than during any other\r\nadministration I have known. As time passed and we became better\r\nacquainted, my respect and admiration for her greatly increased. I\r\nrepeatedly spent the evening with her informally at the White House when\r\nour intercourse was unhampered by red-tape, and it was then, of course,\r\nthat I saw her at her best. Her _rôle_ was by no means without its\r\nembarrassments. She necessarily knew that many persons of prominence and\r\ninfluence viewed with serious doubt the legality of her husband's title\r\nto the Presidential chair and that there were those who even alluded to\r\nhim as \"His Fraudulency\"; but the world was none the wiser, so far as\r\nshe was concerned, and she pursued the \"even tenor of her way,\" and by\r\nthe subtle influence of her character and conduct won both for her\r\nhusband and herself the admiration of many who, but for her, would\r\nprobably have remained their enemies.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 Stephen J. Field of California was appointed by President\r\nLincoln a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and made his residence in\r\none of the three dwelling-houses on Second Street facing the Capitol,\r\nwhich is said to have been a gift from his brothers, David Dudley, the\r\neminent lawyer; Cyrus W., the father of the Atlantic cable; and the Rev.\r\nDr. Henry M., the eminent Presbyterian divine and versatile editor of\r\n_The New York Evangelist_. Here the brothers met every February to\r\ncelebrate the birthday of David Dudley Field. For many years after the\r\ndestruction of the first Capitol by the British in the War of 1812, the\r\nField house and the two which adjoined it were used by Congress as the\r\nseat of its deliberations. Henry Clay served within its walls as Speaker\r\nfor about ten years, and Mrs. Field took much pride in showing her\r\nguests the mark on the wall where his desk stood. At one period before\r\nits occupancy by Judge Field this residence was used as a boarding\r\nhouse, and in its back parlor John C. Calhoun breathed his last. During\r\nthe Civil War it was used by the government with the two adjoining\r\nhouses as the \"Old Capitol Prison\"--but of this I have spoken in another\r\nplace. Justice Field was \"a gentleman of the old school\" and one of the\r\nmost courtly men in public life, while his wife was well known for her\r\ntact, culture and exquisite taste. Their home was enriched with many\r\ncuriosities collected at home and abroad, and I especially recall a bust\r\nof the young Emperor Augustus, an exact copy of the original in the\r\nVatican. Mrs. Field's sister, Miss Sarah Henderson Swearingen,\r\naccompanied her to Washington and some years later was married from this\r\nhome to John Condit-Smith. My old friend, Dr. Charles W. Hoffman, who\r\nfor twenty years was the librarian of the U.S. Supreme Court, was a near\r\nneighbor and friend of Judge and Mrs. Field. After a life well spent he\r\nretired to the home of his birth in Frederick, Maryland, where he lived\r\nfor many years, surrounded by his well-loved books and art treasures. He\r\nnever married.\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew Mr. and Mrs. James G. Blaine they were living on\r\nFifteenth Street between H and I Streets. Miss Abigail Dodge, \"Gail\r\nHamilton,\" a cousin of Mrs. Blaine, resided with them and added greatly\r\nto the charm of the establishment. The world in general as well as his\r\neulogists have done full justice to Mr. Blaine's amazing tact and charm\r\nof manner; but I may be pardoned the conceit if I offer my own tribute\r\nby referring to a graceful remark he made the first time I had the\r\npleasure of meeting him. I heard someone say: \"Here comes Mr. Blaine,\"\r\nand as I turned and he was formally presented to me I saw before me a\r\ndistinguished looking middle-aged man of commanding presence, who, as he\r\nraised his hat to greet me, remarked in a low and pleasant voice: \"I bow\r\nto the name!\"\r\n\r\nThe social column so generally in vogue in all the large newspapers\r\nthroughout the country was introduced into Washington about 1870. Miss\r\nAugustine Snead, who wrote under the _nom de plume_ of \"Miss Grundy,\"\r\nwas the first woman society reporter I ever knew. She represented\r\nseveral newspapers, and she and her mother, Mrs. Fayette Snead, herself\r\na graceful writer under the pen name of \"Fay,\" were seen at many\r\nentertainments. Both of them were wide-awake and clever women. I happen\r\nto have preserved an article which appeared in the society column of\r\n_The Evening Star_, written by Miss Snead, which is largely made up of\r\npuns upon the society men of the day, some of whom are now gray-haired\r\nveterans and some, alas! are no longer here. She wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"Our society men are sighing for their rights and complain that whereas\r\nit is only once in four years they have the privilege of being courted\r\nand receiving special attention the social columns of the newspapers\r\nshould give them more space. We have detailed one of our corps for the\r\npurpose with the following result. It (s)Eames to us that the officers\r\nof the Marine Corps are Muse-ing on an exhibition of their Zeal in the\r\ninvention of a patent Payne-killer, in proof that they have not leaned\r\nupon a broken Reed. Some one may call us Palmer (H)off of bad puns, but\r\nwe have not given A(u)lick amiss. No wonder the Marine Corps, in hourly\r\ndread of annihilation, has its anxieties increased by the continuance of\r\nthe Alarm at the Navy Yard, the officers of that formidable little\r\nvessel having proved through the season that it is well named, by each\r\nstriking eight _belles_ per hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eames\" was my nephew, Charles Campbell Eames. \"Muse\" was General\r\nWilliam S. Muse, U.S.M.C., now residing on the Eastern Shore of\r\nMaryland, who usually spends a portion of each year at the Capital.\r\n\"Zeal in\" referred to Lieutenant William F. Zeilin, U.S.M.C., a son of\r\nGeneral Jacob Zeilin, U.S.M.C. \"Payne\" was Frederick H. Paine, formerly\r\nin the Navy, who still makes Washington his home. \"Reed\" was General\r\nGeorge C. Reid, U.S.M.C., now residing in Washington. \"(H)off\" was\r\nCaptain William Bainbridge Hoff, U.S.N., who died a few years ago; and\r\n\"Palmer\" was Lieutenant Aulick Palmer, formerly in the Marine Corps and\r\nnow U.S. Marshal of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew the distinguished scientist, Professor Theodore E.\r\nHilgard, he and his wife were living on N Street, near Twelfth Street.\r\nFor many years he was Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and after an\r\ninterval of a number of years was succeeded by his nephew, Mr. Otto H.\r\nTittmann. The latter and his wife are now among the widely-known and\r\npopular residents of Washington. The French Government in appreciation\r\nof Professor Hilgard's scientific achievements presented to him a superb\r\nvase which is now owned by Dr. Thomas N. Vincent.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago my daughters and I formed a friendship with\r\nSenator and Mrs. James B. Beck of Kentucky and their daughter, the wife\r\nof General Green Clay Goodloe of the U.S. Marine Corps. Mr. Beck was one\r\nof the Democratic leaders in the Senate and was regarded as among the\r\nablest men of his party. He was proud of his Scotch blood and loyal in\r\nhis friendships. His wife was Miss Jane Washington Augusta Thornton,\r\nwhose grandfather, Colonel John Thornton of Rappahannock County,\r\nVirginia, was a first cousin of General Washington. Both the Senator and\r\nhis wife have passed onward, but our affection still lives in General\r\nand Mrs. Goodloe, who are among the best and truest friends I have ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nJust before the close of the Hayes administration, Walter D. Davidge,\r\nwhose home for many years was on Sixth Street, built a large mansion on\r\nthe corner of H and Seventeenth Streets and upon its completion he and\r\nMrs. Davidge, who was Miss Anna Louisa Washington, gave a housewarming.\r\nChampagne flowed freely upon this occasion and it is said that the\r\nsupper was one of the handsomest and most elaborate ever served in\r\nWashington. The same winter my daughters attended a brilliant ball given\r\nat Stewart Castle by its chatelaine, Mrs. William M. Stewart, whose\r\nhusband was one of the U.S. Senators from Nevada. She was the daughter\r\nof Senator Henry S. Foote, who represented Mississippi in ante-bellum\r\ndays, and gave the ball in honor of several Virginia girls who were her\r\nguests. She was assisted in the entertainment by her two elder\r\ndaughters, both of whom were married. Stewart Castle was well adapted\r\nfor such a social function as it was one of the few mansions in\r\nWashington that had a spacious ballroom. This residence was quite\r\nsuburban, and the Hillyer house on Massachusetts Avenue which stood on a\r\nhigh terrace was the only other dwelling in the immediate vicinity. I\r\nremember that when the home of the British Embassy was in the course of\r\nerection, the wisdom of the location was greatly questioned, owing to\r\nits remoteness from the fashionable center of the city.\r\n\r\nDuring the Arthur administration, Mr. Edward C. Halliday and his wife\r\ncame to the National Capital to spend a winter. I had known him many\r\nyears before when he visited the widow of General Alexander Macomb in\r\nher home on the corner of I and Seventeenth Streets, where the Farragut\r\napartment house now stands. He was of a Scotch family which originally\r\nsettled in New York, and his father for some years was President of the\r\nSt. Andrews Society of that city. After residing several months in\r\nWashington Mr. Halliday built several houses opposite the British\r\nEmbassy on N Street, the largest of which he reserved for his own\r\nresidence. It was here that Mr. and Mrs. Halliday entertained with such\r\ntrue Scotch hospitality. Their Friday evenings were bright spots on the\r\nsocial horizon, especially for the young people, as dancing was one of\r\ntheir special features. Just before the close of her second social\r\nseason Mrs. Halliday gave a fancy-dress ball, which was a happy\r\ninspiration, varying as it did the monotony of germans, receptions and\r\nteas. On this occasion the minuet was danced by the younger guests\r\ndressed in Louis XIV. costumes.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1880 the long and painful illness of my husband closed\r\nin death. He had been handicapped by years of ill health, and, although\r\nhe had the intellectual power, the ability, the wings to spread, there\r\nwas, alas, no surrounding air to bear them up! The ambition was there\r\nand the intense desire, but strength was lacking and he bore his\r\naffliction with sublime fortitude. For a while after his departure I\r\nfelt akin to a ship lost at sea; my moorings were nowhere within sight.\r\nI had leaned on him through so many years of married life, constantly\r\nsustained by his high code of integrity and honor, that his death was\r\nindeed a bereavement too terrible for words to express. I care to say no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe summer of the same year, accompanied by my daughters, I sought the\r\nquietude of the mountains of Virginia. Tarrying in the same house with\r\nme was Mrs. John Griffith Worthington of Georgetown, D.C., with whom I\r\nformed a lasting friendship. The Worthington family resided in the\r\nDistrict long before it became the seat of government and owned\r\nextensive property. Even in extreme old age Mrs. Worthington was one of\r\nthe most truly beautiful women I have ever seen. She was Miss Elizabeth\r\nPhillips of Dayton, Ohio, and a lineal descendant of President Jonathan\r\nDickinson of Princeton University. Her daughter Eliza, Mrs. William\r\nHenry Philip, represented the same type of woman. John G. Worthington's\r\nsister married Judge William Gaston, the eminent jurist of North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Garfield was of short duration. The tragedy which\r\nbrought to a speedy close his earthly career is too well known to be\r\ndwelt upon at length. The mortal attack upon him in 1881 by the fanatic\r\nCharles J. Guiteau in the old Pennsylvania railroad station on the\r\ncorner of Sixth and D Streets shocked the civilized world, and his long\r\nand painful illness at Elberon was closely watched by a sympathizing\r\npublic until it closed in death. Dr. D. W. Bliss was the Garfield family\r\nphysician but the most eminent specialists of the country were called\r\ninto consultation. It is the first time within my memory that I ever\r\nheard of the issue of official bulletins by physicians announcing the\r\ncondition of their patients. At the trial of Guiteau he was defended by\r\nhis brother-in-law, George M. Scoville, while Judge John K. Porter of\r\nNew York and Walter D. Davidge of the Washington bar were employed to\r\nassist in the prosecution. This trial was of such absorbing interest\r\nthat men and women crowded to the City Hall, where admission was granted\r\nonly by ticket. No one could possibly have seen Guiteau without a\r\nfeeling akin to pity, as he displayed every indication of possessing an\r\nunbalanced mind.\r\n\r\nThe administration of President Arthur proved a source of delight to\r\nWashington society and afforded abundant demonstration, as in the cases\r\nof Jefferson, Jackson, Van Buren and Buchanan before him, that a\r\n\"Mistress of the White House\" in the person of a wife is not an absolute\r\nnecessity. Mrs. John E. McElroy, the President's sister, spent much of\r\nher time in Washington and presided with grace over the social functions\r\nof the White House. The President himself was a gentleman of dignified\r\nand imposing presence and of great social as well as political tact. He\r\ninstinctively seemed to know the proper thing to do and exactly when to\r\ndo it. I was deeply touched by his thoughtfulness when my second\r\ndaughter, Ruth Monroe, was married in December, 1882. Although we were\r\nstill in mourning and had no personal acquaintance with the President\r\nnor other association at that time with the White House, General Arthur\r\non that occasion sent superb flowers to my home from the conservatory of\r\nthe Executive Mansion. I regarded the act as exceedingly gracious, but\r\nit was in every way characteristic of the man. The circumstances under\r\nwhich he succeeded to the Presidential chair were so painful and some of\r\nhis former political affiliations were so distasteful to many that the\r\nearly portion of his administration was attended with a certain degree\r\nof embarrassment; yet, by sheer force of character, unquestioned ability\r\nand magnificent tact he so effectively worked his way into the hearts of\r\nthe people that he left the Presidential chair as highly esteemed as any\r\nof his predecessors and carried with him into retirement the applause of\r\nthe people irrespective of party affiliation.\r\n\r\nI made the acquaintance of General and Mrs. Adolphus W. Greely soon\r\nafter his return from his Arctic expedition. Both he and Rear Admiral\r\nWinfield Scott Schley, U.S.N., the rescued and the rescuer, were then\r\nreceiving the ovations of the public. During our early acquaintance the\r\nGreelys purchased a delightful old-fashioned house on G Street, below\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, where they still reside surrounded by a charming\r\ngroup of sons and daughters. General Greely is always an object of\r\ninterest wherever he goes and deservedly so, as scientific attainments,\r\ndistinguished bearing and engaging manners such as his can never fail to\r\nwin applause. Mrs. Greely, the bride of his youth and the companion of\r\nhis maturer years, wins all hearts and holds them.\r\n\r\nIt would be both unjust and ungrateful to make no mention of Mrs. Phoebe\r\nHearst, the mother of William R. Hearst of New York. She came to\r\nWashington an entire stranger as the wife of the late Senator George\r\nHearst of California, but soon endeared herself to all old residents by\r\nher personal magnetism, her social tact and her philanthropic acts.\r\nDeeply in sympathy with the work of women, her benevolence in this\r\nparticular field was unbounded. Her entertainments were lavish and I was\r\noften numbered among her guests. I especially recall an evening\r\nreception given by her in honor of a company of authors attending a\r\ncongress in Washington. It was remarkable for the number of\r\ndistinguished men and women gathered from all parts of the country, some\r\nof whom I had never met before, and among them Mark Twain, Francis\r\nMarion Crawford and William Dean Howells.\r\n\r\nAs I lay down my pen, memories of many old friends are passing before me\r\nand of their children, too. Then there are others with whom I formed\r\nties later in life of the most enduring character. This is especially\r\ntrue of my old and cherished neighbors, Rear Admiral and Mrs. Francis A.\r\nRoe. With his work well done he now rests from his labors, but his widow\r\nis yet my valued friend. Still another is Rear Admiral Winfield Scott\r\nSchley, U.S. N. who, surrounded by admiring friends in Washington, lives\r\nquietly and unostentatiously and bears his laurels well; and last, but\r\nanything in the world but least, Mrs. Julian James, a representative of\r\na distinguished New York family, the daughter of Theodorus Bailey Myers,\r\nwho has made her home in Washington for many years, and is now the \"Lady\r\nBountiful\" of the National Capital. Beautiful in person as well as in\r\ncharacter, she distributes her wealth with a lavish hand, and richly\r\ndeserves the words \"well done.\"\r\n\r\nIn looking backward through the years of a long and active life I have\r\nseen varied relays of humanity, all of them acting their parts and\r\nfilling their appropriate niches--great and small often standing\r\nshoulder to shoulder and engaged in the same strife. Many of them, my\r\nfriends in childhood as well as old age, have long since passed into the\r\nlife beyond. _Vanitas Vanitatis!_ may be the exclamation of the\r\nmoralizing cynic, but to me many of these memories are a blessed\r\nheritage, and I am grateful to the Father of All for permitting me to\r\ncatch from them the inspiration to prepare these rambling notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbert, John, 195.\r\n\r\nAbinger, Lord, 211.\r\n  Lady, 211.\r\n\r\nAdams, Abigail, 134.\r\n  Abigail Louisa Smith, 148.\r\n  Charles, 148.\r\n  Charles Francis, 149, 352.\r\n  Mrs. Charles Francis, 148, 149, 352.\r\n  Elizabeth Combs, 205-207.\r\n  Isaac Hull, 205-207.\r\n  John (1), 57, 134, 147, 148, 206, 316.\r\n  John (2), 214, 282.\r\n  Mrs. John, 214, 282.\r\n  John Quincy, 31, 32, 148, 149, 199, 200, 206, 214, 279, 280, 282.\r\n  Mrs. John Quincy, 279, 280, 332.\r\n  Mary Louisa, 199.\r\n  Thomas Boylston, 206, 207.\r\n  William, 180.\r\n\r\nAddington, Henry Unwin, 279.\r\n\r\nAddison, Joseph, 80.\r\n\r\nAdrian, Robert, 53, 66.\r\n\r\nAgg, John T., 280.\r\n\r\nAlbert, Prince, 163.\r\n  William T., 372.\r\n\r\nAlcott, Amos Bronson, 158.\r\n\r\nAlfonso XIII., of Spain, 100.\r\n\r\nAllen, Eliza, 198.\r\n  John, 198.\r\n\r\nAllerton, Willoughby, 324.\r\n  Mrs. Willoughby, 324.\r\n\r\nAllston, Washington, 99.\r\n\r\nAlmonte, Juan Nepomuceno, 229.\r\n  Mrs. Juan Nepomuceno, 229.\r\n\r\nAlmy, John J., 257.\r\n\r\nAnderson, Richard C, 239.\r\n  Robert, 239.\r\n  Mrs. Robert, 239, 240.\r\n\r\nAndrews, Edward G., 53.\r\n  John A., 178.\r\n\r\nAnne, Queen, 141.\r\n\r\nAnthon, Charles, 13-16, 18.\r\n\r\nAnthony, Henry B., 361.\r\n\r\nAppleton, James Means, 255.\r\n  Jesse, 255.\r\n\r\nArmistead, Richard, 145.\r\n  Mrs. Richard, 69, 146.\r\n  Susan, 73, 145.\r\n\r\nArmstrong, John, 72.\r\n  Mr., of New York, 112.\r\n\r\nArthur, Chester A., 11, 390, 391.\r\n\r\nAshton, Henry, 215.\r\n\r\nAstor, Dorothea, 74.\r\n  Eliza, 75.\r\n  Emily, 53.\r\n  George, 76.\r\n  \"George and Company,\" 76.\r\n  Henry, 75.\r\n  John Jacob (1), 33, 36, 39, 72-77.\r\n  John Jacob (2), 22.\r\n  Magdalen, 74.\r\n  William B., 22, 23, 53, 72.\r\n  William Waldorf, 102.\r\n  \"Astor and Camp,\" 76.\r\n\r\nAtkinson, Henry, 163.\r\n  Mrs. Henry, 163.\r\n\r\nAuchmuty, Richard Tyldin, 364.\r\n\r\nAudenreid, Florence, 373.\r\n  Joseph C., 372.\r\n\r\nAugustus, Emperor, 385.\r\n\r\nAulick, John H., 169.\r\n\r\n\r\nBache, Eliza Ann, 78.\r\n  Matilda, 278.\r\n\r\nBacon, Alice, 19.\r\n  Delia, 19.\r\n  Francis, 34.\r\n  Julia, 19.\r\n  Leonard, 19.\r\n\r\nBadger, Miss, 374.\r\n\r\nBakhmeteff, Madame, 364.\r\n\r\nBalfe, Michael William, 227.\r\n  Victoire, 227.\r\n\r\nBall, Mary, 377.\r\n\r\nBancroft, George, 171, 199, 371, 372.\r\n  Mrs. George, 106, 372.\r\n\r\nBankhead, James, 186, 211.\r\n  The Misses, 186.\r\n\r\nBanks, Nathaniel P., 178, 315.\r\n\r\nBannister, Mr., 185.\r\n\r\nBantz, Gideon, 340.\r\n\r\nBaraza, Cipriano, 297.\r\n\r\nBarbour, James L., 175.\r\n\r\nBarca, de la, Don Calderon, 233.\r\n  Madame Calderon, 233, 252.\r\n\r\nBarclay, Andrew D., 142.\r\n\r\nBard, Samuel, 146.\r\n  William, 146.\r\n\r\nBarker, Jacob, 43.\r\n\r\nBarlow, Francis C., 184.\r\n\r\nBarnum, P.
