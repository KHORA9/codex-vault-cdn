The time seems ripe, therefore, for a more\r\nextended sketch of Lamarck and his theory, as well as of his work as a\r\nphilosophical biologist, than has yet appeared.\r\n\r\nBut the seeker after the details of his life is baffled by the general\r\nignorance about the man--his antecedents, his parentage, the date of his\r\nbirth, his early training and education, his work as a professor in the\r\nJardin des Plantes, the house he lived in, the place of his burial, and\r\nhis relations to his scientific contemporaries.\r\n\r\nExcept the _éloges_ of Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Cuvier, and the brief\r\nnotices of Martins, Duval, Bourguignat, and Bourguin, there is no\r\nspecial biography, however brief, except a _brochure_ of thirty-one\r\npages, reprinted from a few scattered articles by the distinguished\r\nanthropologist, M. Gabriel de Mortillet, in the fourth and last volume\r\nof a little-known journal, _l'Homme_, entitled _Lamarck. Par un Groupe\r\nde Transformistes, ses Disciples_, Paris, 1887. This exceedingly rare\r\npamphlet was written by the late M. Gabriel de Mortillet, with the\r\nassistance of Philippe Salmon and Dr. A. Mondière, who with others,\r\nunder the leadership of Paul Nicole, met in 1884 and formed a _Réunion\r\nLamarck_ and a _Dîner Lamarck_, to maintain and perpetuate the memory of\r\nthe great French transformist. Owing to their efforts, the exact date of\r\nLamarck's birth, the house in which he lived during his lifetime at\r\nParis, and all that we shall ever know of his place of burial have been\r\nestablished. It is a lasting shame that his remains were not laid in a\r\ngrave, but were allowed to be put into a trench, with no headstone to\r\nmark the site, on one side of a row of graves of others better cared\r\nfor, from which trench his bones, with those of others unknown and\r\nneglected, were exhumed and thrown into the catacombs of Paris. Lamarck\r\nleft behind him no letters or manuscripts; nothing could be ascertained\r\nregarding the dates of his marriages, the names of his wives or of all\r\nhis children. Of his descendants but one is known to be living, an\r\nofficer in the army. But his aims in life, his undying love of science,\r\nhis noble character and generous disposition are constantly revealed in\r\nhis writings.\r\n\r\nThe name of Lamarck has been familiar to me from my youth up. When a\r\nboy, I used to arrange my collection of shells by the Lamarckian system,\r\nwhich had replaced the old Linnean classification. For over thirty years\r\nthe Lamarckian factors of evolution have seemed to me to afford the\r\nfoundation on which natural selection rests, to be the primary and\r\nefficient causes of organic change, and thus to account for the origin\r\nof variations, which Darwin himself assumed as the starting point or\r\nbasis of his selection theory. It is not lessening the value of Darwin's\r\nlabors, to recognize the originality of Lamarck's views, the vigor with\r\nwhich he asserted their truth, and the heroic manner in which, against\r\nadverse and contemptuous criticism, to his dying day he clung to them.\r\n\r\nDuring a residence in Paris in the spring and summer of 1899, I spent my\r\nleisure hours in gathering material for this biography. I visited the\r\nplace of his birth--the little hamlet of Bazentin, near Amiens--and,\r\nthanks to the kindness of the schoolmaster of that village, M. Duval,\r\nwas shown the house where Lamarck was born, the records in the old\r\nparish register at the _mairie_ of the birth of the father of Lamarck\r\nand of Lamarck himself. The Jesuit Seminary at Amiens was also visited,\r\nin order to obtain traces of his student life there, though the search\r\nwas unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to Professor A. Giard of Paris for kind assistance in\r\nthe loan of rare books, for copies of his own essays, especially his\r\n_Leçon d'Ouverture des Cours de l'Évolution des Êtres organisés_, 1888,\r\nand in facilitating the work of collecting data. Introduced by him to\r\nProfessor Hamy, the learned anthropologist and archivist of the Muséum\r\nd'Histoire Naturelle, I was given by him the freest access to the\r\narchives in the Maison de Buffon, which, among other papers, contained\r\nthe MS. _Archives du Muséum_; _i.e._, the _Procès verbaux des Séances\r\ntenues par les Officiers du Jardin des Plantes_, from 1790 to 1830,\r\nbound in vellum, in thirty-four volumes. These were all looked through,\r\nthough found to contain but little of biographical interest relating to\r\nLamarck, beyond proving that he lived in that ancient edifice from 1793\r\nuntil his death in 1829. Dr. Hamy's elaborate history of the last years\r\nof the Royal Garden and of the foundation of the Muséum d'Histoire\r\nNaturelle, in the volume commemorating the centennial of the foundation\r\nof the Museum, has been of essential service.\r\n\r\nMy warmest thanks are due to M. Adrien de Mortillet, formerly secretary\r\nof the Society of Anthropology of Paris, for most essential aid. He\r\nkindly gave me a copy of a very rare pamphlet, entitled _Lamarck. Par un\r\nGroupe de Transformistes, ses Disciples_. He also referred me to notices\r\nbearing on the genealogy of Lamarck and his family in the _Revue de\r\nGascogne_ for 1876. To him also I am indebted for the privilege of\r\nhaving electrotypes made of the five illustrations in the _Lamarck_, for\r\ncopies of the composite portrait of Lamarck by Dr. Gachet, and also for\r\na photograph of the _Acte de Naissance_ reproduced by the late\r\nM. Salmon.\r\n\r\nI have also to acknowledge the kindness shown me by Dr. J. Deniker, the\r\nlibrarian of the Bibliothèque du Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle.\r\n\r\nI had begun in the museum library, which contains nearly if not every\r\none of Lamarck's publications, to prepare a bibliography of all of\r\nLamarck's writings, when, to my surprise and pleasure, I was presented\r\nwith a very full and elaborate one by the assistant-librarian,\r\nM. Godefroy Malloisel.\r\n\r\nTo Professor Edmond Perrier I am indebted for a copy of his valuable\r\n_Lamarck et le Transformisme Actuel_, reprinted from the noble volume\r\ncommemorative of the centennial of the foundation of the Muséum\r\nd'Histoire Naturelle, which has proved of much use.\r\n\r\nOther sources from which biographical details have been taken are\r\nCuvier's _éloge_, and the notice of Lamarck, with a list of many of his\r\nwritings, in the _Revue biographique de la Société malacologique de\r\nFrance_, 1886. This notice, which is illustrated by three portraits of\r\nLamarck, one of which has been reproduced, I was informed by M. Paul\r\nKleinsieck was prepared by the late J. R. Bourguignat, the eminent\r\nmalacologist and anthropologist. The notices by Professor Mathias Duval\r\nand by L. A. Bourguin have been of essential service.\r\n\r\nAs regards the account of Lamarck's speculative and theoretical views, I\r\nhave, so far as possible, preferred, by abstracts and translations, to\r\nlet him tell his own story, rather than to comment at much length myself\r\non points about which the ablest thinkers and students differ so much.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that Lamarck's writings referring to the evolution theory\r\nmay, at no distant date, be reprinted in the original, as they are not\r\nbulky and could be comprised in a single volume.\r\n\r\nThis life is offered with much diffidence, though the pleasure of\r\ncollecting the materials and of putting them together has been very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n    BROWN UNIVERSITY, PROVIDENCE, R.

HIS LIFE AND WORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nBIRTH, FAMILY, YOUTH, AND MILITARY CAREER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of Lamarck is the old, old story of a man of genius who lived\r\nfar in advance of his age, and who died comparatively unappreciated and\r\nneglected. But his original and philosophic views, based as they were on\r\nbroad conceptions of nature, and touching on the burning questions of\r\nour day, have, after the lapse of a hundred years, gained fresh interest\r\nand appreciation, and give promise of permanent acceptance.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Flore Française_ will never be forgotten by his\r\ncountrymen, who called him the French Linné; and he who wrote the\r\n_Animaux sans Vertèbres_ at once took the highest rank as the leading\r\nzoölogist of his period. But Lamarck was more than a systematic\r\nbiologist of the first order. Besides rare experience and judgment in\r\nthe classification of plants and of animals, he had an unusually active,\r\ninquiring, and philosophical mind, with an originality and boldness in\r\nspeculation, and soundness in reasoning and in dealing with such\r\nbiological facts as were known in his time, which have caused his views\r\nas to the method of organic evolution to again come to the front.\r\n\r\nAs a zoölogical philosopher no one of his time approached Lamarck. The\r\nperiod, however, in which he lived was not ripe for the hearty and\r\ngeneral adoption of the theory of descent. As in the organic world we\r\nbehold here and there prophetic types, anticipating, in their\r\ngeneralized synthetic nature, the incoming, ages after, of more\r\nspecialized types, so Lamarck anticipated by more than half a century\r\nthe principles underlying the present evolutionary theories.\r\n\r\nSo numerous are now the adherents, in some form, of Lamarck's views,\r\nthat at the present time evolutionists are divided into Darwinians and\r\nLamarckians or Neolamarckians. The factors of organic evolution as\r\nstated by Lamarck, it is now claimed by many, really comprise the\r\nprimary or foundation principles or initiative causes of the origin of\r\nlife-forms. Hence not only do many of the leading biologists of his\r\nnative country, but some of those of Germany, of the United States, and\r\nof England, justly regard him as the founder of the theory of organic\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nBesides this, Lamarck lived in a transition period. He prepared the way\r\nfor the scientific renascence in France. Moreover, his simple, unselfish\r\ncharacter was a rare one. He led a retired life. His youth was tinged\r\nwith romance, and during the last decade of his life he was blind. He\r\nmanfully and patiently bore adverse criticisms, ridicule,\r\nforgetfulness, and inappreciation, while, so far from renouncing his\r\ntheoretical views, he tenaciously clung to them to his dying day.\r\n\r\nThe biography of such a character is replete with interest, and the\r\nmemory of his unselfish and fruitful devotion to science should be\r\nforever cherished. His life was also notable for the fact that after his\r\nfiftieth year he took up and mastered a new science; and at a period\r\nwhen many students of literature and science cease to be productive and\r\nrest from their labors, he accomplished the best work of his life--work\r\nwhich has given him lasting fame as a systematist and as a philosophic\r\nbiologist. Moreover, Lamarckism comprises the fundamental principles of\r\nevolution, and will always have to be taken into consideration in\r\naccounting for the origin, not only of species, but especially of the\r\nhigher groups, such as orders, classes, and phyla.\r\n\r\nThis striking personage in the history of biological science, who has\r\nmade such an ineffaceable impression on the philosophy of biology,\r\ncertainly demands more than a brief _éloge_ to keep alive his memory.\r\n\r\n       ~       ~       ~       ~       ~\r\n\r\nJean-Baptiste-Pierre-Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck, was born\r\nAugust 1, 1744, at Bazentin-le-Petit. This little village is situated in\r\nPicardy, or what is now the Department of the Somme, in the\r\nArrondissement de Péronne, Canton d'Albert, a little more than four\r\nmiles from Albert, between this town and Bapaume, and near Longueval,\r\nthe nearest post-office to Bazentin. The village of Bazentin-le-Grand,\r\ncomposed of a few more houses than its sister hamlet, is seen half a\r\nmile to the southeast, shaded by the little forest such as borders\r\nnearly every town and village in this region. The two hamlets are\r\npleasantly situated in a richly cultivated country, on the chalk uplands\r\nor downs of Picardy, amid broad acres of wheat and barley variegated\r\nwith poppies and the purple cornflower, and with roadsides shaded by\r\ntall poplars.\r\n\r\nThe peasants to the number of 251 compose the diminishing population.\r\nThere were 356 in 1880, or about that date. The silence of the single\r\nlittle street, with its one-storied, thatched or tiled cottages, is at\r\ninfrequent intervals broken by an elderly dame in her _sabots_, or by a\r\ncreaking, rickety village cart driven by a farmer-boy in blouse and\r\nhob-nailed shoes. The largest inhabited building is the _mairie_, a\r\nmodern structure, at one end of which is the village school, where\r\nfifteen or twenty urchins enjoy the instructions of the worthy teacher.\r\nA stone church, built in 1774, and somewhat larger than the needs of the\r\nhamlet at present require, raises its tower over the quiet scene.\r\n\r\nOur pilgrimage to Bazentin had for its object the discovery of the\r\nbirthplace of Lamarck, of which we could obtain no information in Paris.\r\nOur guide from Albert took us to the _mairie_, and it was with no little\r\nsatisfaction that we learned from the excellent village teacher,\r\nM. Duval, that the house in which the great naturalist was born was\r\nstill standing, and but a few steps away, in the rear of the church and\r\nof the _mairie_. With much kindness he left his duties in the\r\nschoolroom, and accompanied us to the ancient structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF LAMARCK, FRONT VIEW]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF LAMARCK]\r\n\r\nThe modest _château_ stands a few rods to the westward of the little\r\nvillage, and was evidently the seat of the leading family of the place.\r\nIt faces east and is a two-storied house of the shape seen everywhere in\r\nFrance, with its high, incurved roof; the walls, nearly a foot and a\r\nhalf thick, built of brick; the corners and windows of blocks of white\r\nlimestone. It is about fifty feet long and twenty-five feet wide. Above\r\nthe roof formerly rose a small tower. There is no porch over the front\r\ndoor. Within, a rather narrow hall passes through the centre, and opens\r\ninto a large room on each side. What was evidently the drawing-room or\r\n_salon_ was a spacious apartment with a low white wainscot and a heavy\r\ncornice. Over the large, roomy fireplace is a painting on the wood\r\npanel, representing a rural scene, in which a shepherdess and her lover\r\nare engaged in other occupations than the care of the flock of sheep\r\nvisible in the distance. Over the doorway is a smaller but quaint\r\npainting of the same description. The house is uninhabited, and perhaps\r\nuninhabitable--indeed almost a ruin--and is used as a storeroom for wood\r\nand rubbish by the peasants in the adjoining house to the left, on the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe ground in front was cultivated with vegetables, not laid down to a\r\nlawn, and the land stretched back for perhaps three hundred to four\r\nhundred feet between the old garden walls.\r\n\r\nHere, amid these rural scenes, even now so beautiful and tranquil, the\r\nsubject of our sketch was born and lived through his infancy and early\r\nboyhood.[1]\r\n\r\nIf his parents did not possess an ample fortune, they were blessed with\r\na numerous progeny, for Lamarck was the eleventh and youngest child, and\r\nseems to have survived all the others. Biographers have differed as to\r\nthe date of the birth of Lamarck.[2] Happily the exact date had been\r\nascertained through the researches of M. Philippe Salmon; and M. Duval\r\nkindly showed us in the thin volume of records, with its tattered and\r\ntorn leaves, the register of the _Acte de Naissance_, and made a copy of\r\nit, as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Extrait du Registre aux Actes de Baptême de la Commune de Bazentin,\r\n  pour l'Année 1744._\r\n\r\n  L'an mil sept cent quarante-quatre, le premier août est né en\r\n  légitime mariage et le lendemain a été baptisé par moy curé\r\n  soussigné Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine, fils de Messire Jacques\r\n  Philippe de Monet, chevalier de Lamarck, seigneur des Bazentin grand\r\n  et petit et de haute et puissante Dame Marie Françoise de Fontaine\r\n  demeurant en leur château de Bazentin le petit, son parrain a été\r\n  Messire Jean Baptiste de Fossé, prêtre-chanoine de l'église\r\n  collégiale de St. Farcy de Péronne, y demeurant, sa marraine Dame\r\n  Antoinette Françoise de Bucy, nièce de Messire Louis Joseph\r\n  Michelet, chevalier, ancien commissaire de l'artillerie de France\r\n  demeurante au château de Guillemont, qui ont signé avec mon dit\r\n  sieur de Bazentin et nous.\r\n\r\n  Ont signé: De Fossé, De Bucy Michelet, Bazentin. Cozette, curé.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACT OF BIRTH]\r\n\r\nOf Lamarck's parentage and ancestry there are fortunately some traces.\r\nIn the _Registre aux Actes de Baptême pour l'Année 1702_, still\r\npreserved in the _mairie_ of Bazentin-le-Petit, the record shows that\r\nhis father was born in February, 1702, at Bazentin. The infant was\r\nbaptised February 16, 1702, the permission to the _curé_ by Henry,\r\nBishop of Amiens, having been signed February 3, 1702. Lamarck's\r\ngrandparents were, according to this certificate of baptism, Messire\r\nPhilippe de Monet de Lamarck, Ecuyer, Seigneur des Bazentin, and Dame\r\nMagdeleine de Lyonne.\r\n\r\nThe family of Lamarck, as stated by H. Masson,[3] notwithstanding his\r\nnorthern and almost Germanic name of Chevalier de Lamarck, originated in\r\nthe southwest of France. Though born at Bazentin, in old Picardy, it is\r\nnot less true that he descended on the paternal side from an ancient\r\nhouse of Béarn, whose patrimony was very modest. This house was that of\r\nMonet.\r\n\r\nAnother genealogist, Baron C. de Cauna,[4] tells us that there is no\r\ndoubt that the family of Monet in Bigorre[5] was divided. One of its\r\nrepresentatives formed a branch in Picardy in the reign of Louis XIV.\r\nor later.\r\n\r\nLamarck's grandfather, Philippe de Monet, \"seigneur de Bazentin et\r\nautres lieux,\" was also \"chevalier de l'ordre royal et militaire de\r\nSaint-Louis, commandant pour le roi en la ville et château de Dinan,\r\npensionnaire de sa majesté.\"\r\n\r\nThe descendants of Philippe de Lamarck were, adds de Cauna, thus thrown\r\ninto two branches, or at least two offshoots or stems (_brisures_), near\r\nPéronne. But the actual posterity of the Monet of Picardy was reduced to\r\na single family, claiming back, with good reason, to a southern origin.\r\nOne of its scions in the maternal line was a brilliant officer of the\r\nmilitary marine and also son-in-law of a very distinguished naval\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nThe family of Monet was represented among the French nobility of 1789 by\r\nMessires de Monet de Caixon and de Monet de Saint-Martin. By marriage\r\ntheir grandson was connected with an honorable family of Montant, near\r\nSaint-Sever-Cap.\r\n\r\nAnother authority, the Abbé J. Dulac, has thrown additional light on the\r\ngenealogy of the de Lamarck family, which, it may be seen, was for at\r\nleast three centuries a military one.[6] The family of Monet, Seigneur\r\nde Saint-Martin et de Sombran, was maintained as a noble one by order of\r\nthe Royal Council of State of June 20, 1678. He descended (I) from\r\nBernard de Monet, esquire, captain of the château of Lourdes, who had as\r\na son (II) Étienne de Monet, esquire, who, by contract dated August 15,\r\n1543, married Marguerite de Sacaze. He was the father of (III) Pierre\r\nde Monet, esquire, \"Seigneur d'Ast, en Béarn, guidon des gendarmes de la\r\ncompagnie du roi de Navarre.\" From him descended (IV) Étienne de Monet,\r\nesquire, second of the name, \"Seigneur d'Ast et Lamarque, de Julos.\" He\r\nwas a captain by rank, and bought the estate of Saint-Martin in 1592. He\r\nmarried, in 1612, Jeanne de Lamarque, daughter of William de Lamarck,\r\n\"Seigneur de Lamarque et de Bretaigne.\" They had three children, the\r\nthird of whom was Philippe, \"chevalier de Saint-Louis, commandant du\r\nchâteau de Dinan, Seigneur de Bazentin, en Picardy,\" who, as we have\r\nalready seen, was the father of the naturalist Lamarck, who lived from\r\n1744 to 1829. The abbé relates that Philippe, the father of the\r\nnaturalist, was born at Saint-Martin, in the midst of Bigorre, \"_in\r\npleine Bigorre_,\" and he very neatly adds that \"the Bigorrais have the\r\nright to claim for their land of flowers one of the glories of\r\nbotany.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe name was at first variously spelled de Lamarque, de la Marck, or\r\nde Lamarck. He himself signed his name, when acting as secretary of the\r\nAssembly of Professors-administrative of the Museum of Natural History\r\nduring the years of the First Republic, as plain Lamarck.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry arises how, being the eleventh child, he acquired the title\r\nof chevalier, which would naturally have become extinct with the death\r\nof the oldest son. The Abbé Dulac suggests that the ten older of the\r\nchildren had died, or that by some family arrangement he was allowed to\r\nadd the domanial name to the patronymic one. Certainly he never\r\ntarnished the family name, which, had it not been for him, would have\r\nremained in obscurity.\r\n\r\nAs to his father's tastes and disposition, what influence his mother had\r\nin shaping his character, his home environment, as the youngest of\r\neleven children, the nature of his education in infancy and boyhood,\r\nthere are no sources of information. But several of his brothers entered\r\nthe army, and the domestic atmosphere was apparently a military one.\r\n\r\nPhilippe de Lamarck, with his large family, had endowed his first-born\r\nson so that he could maintain the family name and title, and had found\r\nsituations for several of the others in the army. Jean Lamarck did not\r\nmanifest any taste for the clerical profession. He lived in a martial\r\natmosphere. For centuries his ancestors had borne arms. His eldest\r\nbrother had been killed in the breach at the siege of Berg-op-Zoom; two\r\nothers were still in the service, and in the troublous times at the\r\nbeginning of the war in 1756, a young man of high spirit and courage\r\nwould naturally not like to relinquish the prospect of renown and\r\npromotion. But, yielding to the wishes of his father, he entered as a\r\nstudent at the college of the Jesuits at Amiens.[8]\r\n\r\nHis father dying in 1760, nothing could induce the incipient abbé, then\r\nseventeen years of age, to longer wear his bands. Immediately on\r\nreturning home he bought himself a wretched horse, for want of means to\r\nbuy a better one, and, accompanied by a poor lad of his village, he\r\nrode across the country to join the French army, then campaigning in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOGRAPH OF LAMARCK, JANUARY 25, 1802\r\n\r\nje prie le Citoyen qui assemble dans le Magazin de l'imprimerie du\r\nCitoyen Agasse de remettre à Madame chevalier Cent exemplaires de mon\r\nhydrogeologie, pour les Brocher.\r\n\r\nParis le 5 pluviose an dix\r\n\r\nLamarck]\r\n\r\nHe carried with him a letter of recommendation from one of his neighbors\r\non an adjoining estate in the country, Madame de Lameth, to M.\r\nde Lastic, colonel of the regiment of Beaujolais.[9]\r\n\r\n  \"We can imagine [says Cuvier] the feelings of this officer on thus\r\n  finding himself hampered with a boy whose puny appearance made him\r\n  seem still younger than he was. However, he sent him to his\r\n  quarters, and then busied himself with his duties. The period indeed\r\n  was a critical one. It was the 16th of July, 1761. The Marshal\r\n  de Broglie had just united his army with that of the Prince\r\n  de Soubise, and the next day was to attack the allied army commanded\r\n  by the Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. At the break of day M.\r\n  de Lastic rode along the front of his corps, and the first man that\r\n  met his gaze was the new recruit, who, without saying anything to\r\n  him, had placed himself in the front rank of a company of\r\n  grenadiers, and nothing could induce him to quit his post.\r\n\r\n  \"It is a matter of history that this battle, which bears the name of\r\n  the little village of Fissingshausen, between Ham and Lippstadt, in\r\n  Westphalia, was lost by the French, and that the two generals,\r\n  mutually accusing each other of this defeat, immediately separated,\r\n  and abandoned the campaign.\r\n\r\n  \"During the movement of the battle, de Lamarck's company was\r\n  stationed in a position exposed to the direct fire of the enemy's\r\n  artillery. In the confusion of the retreat he was forgotten. Already\r\n  all the officers and non-commissioned officers had been killed;\r\n  there remained only fourteen men, when the oldest grenadier, seeing\r\n  that there were no more of the French troops in sight, proposed to\r\n  the young volunteer, become so promptly commander, to withdraw his\r\n  little troop. 'But we are assigned to this post,' said the boy, 'and\r\n  we should not withdraw from it until we are relieved.' And he made\r\n  them remain there until the colonel, seeing that the squad did not\r\n  rally, sent him an orderly, who crept by all sorts of covered ways\r\n  to reach him. This bold stand having been reported to the marshal,\r\n  he promoted him on the field to the rank of an officer, although his\r\n  order had prescribed that he should be very chary of these kinds of\r\n  promotions.\"\r\n\r\nHis physical courage shown at this age was paralleled by his moral\r\ncourage in later years. The staying power he showed in immovably\r\nadhering to his views on evolution through many years, and under the\r\ndirect and raking fire of harsh and unrelenting criticism and ridicule\r\nfrom friend and foe, affords a striking contrast to the moral timidity\r\nshown by Buffon when questioned by the Sorbonne. We can see that Lamarck\r\nwas the stuff martyrs are made of, and that had he been tried for heresy\r\nhe would have been another Tycho Brahe.\r\n\r\nSoon after, de Lamarck was nominated to a lieutenancy; but so glorious a\r\nbeginning of his military career was most unexpectedly checked. A sudden\r\naccident forced him to leave the service and entirely change his course\r\nof life. His regiment had been, during peace, sent into garrison, first\r\nat Toulon and then at Monaco. While there a comrade in play lifted him\r\nby the head; this gave rise to an inflammation of the lymphatic glands\r\nof the neck, which, not receiving the necessary attention on the spot,\r\nobliged him to go to Paris for better treatment.\r\n\r\n  \"The united efforts [says Cuvier] of several surgeons met with no\r\n  better success, and danger had become very imminent, when our\r\n  _confrère_, the late M. Tenon, with his usual sagacity, recognized\r\n  the trouble, and put an end to it by a complicated operation, of\r\n  which M. de Lamarck preserved deep scars. This treatment lasted for\r\n  a year, and, during this time, the extreme scantiness of his\r\n  resources confined him to a solitary life, when he had the leisure\r\n  to devote himself to meditations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In the little chapel next the church lies buried, we were told by\r\nM. Duval, a Protestant of the family of de Guillebon, the purchaser\r\n(_acquéreur_) of the _château_. Whether the estate is now in the hands\r\nof his heirs we did not ascertain.\r\n\r\n[2] As stated by G. de Mortillet, the date of his birth is variously\r\ngiven. Michaud's _Dictionnaire Biographique_ gives the date April 1;\r\nother authors, April 11; others, the correct one, August 1, 1744.\r\n(_Lamarck. Par un Groupe de Transformistes, ses Disciples._ _L'Homme_,\r\niv. p. 289, 1887.)\r\n\r\n[3] \"Sur la maison de Viella--les Mortiers-brévise et les Montalembert\r\nen Gascogne--et sur le naturaliste Lamarck.\" Par Hippolyte Masson.\r\n(_Revue de Gascogne_, xvii., pp. 141-143, 1876.)\r\n\r\n[4] _Ibid._, p. 194.\r\n\r\n[5] A small town in southwestern France, near Lourdes and Pau; it is\r\nabout eight miles north of Tarbes, in Gascony.\r\n\r\n[6] _Revue de Gascogne_, pp. 264-269, 1876.\r\n\r\n[7] The abbé attempts to answer the question as to what place gave\r\norigin to the name of Lamarck, and says:\r\n\r\n\"The author of the history of Béarn considered the cradle of the race to\r\nhave been the freehold of Marca, parish of Gou (Basses-Pyrénées). A\r\nbranch of the family established in le Magnoac changed its name of Marca\r\nto that of La Marque.\" It was M. d'Ossat who gave rise to this change by\r\naddressing his letters to M. de Marca (at the time when he was preceptor\r\nof his nephew), sometimes under the name of M. Marca, sometimes\r\n_M. la Marqua_, or of _M. de la Marca_, but more often still under that\r\nof _M. de la Marque_, \"with the object, no doubt, of making him a\r\nFrenchman\" (\"_dans la vue sans doute de le franciser_\"). (_Vie du\r\nCardinal d'Ossat_, tome i., p. 319.)\r\n\r\n\"To recall their origin, the branch of Magnoac to-day write their name\r\n_Marque-Marca_. If the Marca of the historian belongs to Béarn, the\r\nLamarque of the naturalist, an orthographic name in principle, proceeds\r\nfrom Bigorre, actually chosen (_désignée_) by _Lamarcq, Pontacq, or\r\nLamarque près Béarn_. That the _Lamarque_ of the botanist of the royal\r\ncabinet distinguished himself from all the _Lamarques_ of Béarn or of\r\nBigorre, which it bears (_qu'il gise_) to this day in the\r\nHautes-Pyrénées, Canton d'Ossun, we have many proofs: Aast at some\r\ndistance, Bourcat and Couet all near l'Abbaye Laïque, etc. The village\r\nso determined is called in turn _Marca_, _La Marque_, _Lamarque_; names\r\npredestined to several destinations; judge then to the mercy of a\r\nbotanist, _Lamarck_, _La Marck_, _Delamarque_, _De Lamarck_, who shall\r\ndetermine their number? As to the last, I only explain it by a fantasy\r\nof the man who would de-Bigorrize himself in order to Germanize himself\r\nin the hope, apparently, that at the first utterance of the name people\r\nwould believe that he was from the _outre Rhin_ rather than from the\r\nborders of Gave or of Adour. Consequently a hundred times more learned\r\nand a hundred times more worthy of a professorship in the Museum, where\r\nMonet would seem (_entrevait_) much less than Lamarque.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added that Béarn was an ancient province of southern France\r\nnearly corresponding to the present Department of Basses-Pyrénées. Its\r\ncapital was Pau.\r\n\r\n[8] We have been unable to ascertain the date when young Lamarck entered\r\nthe seminary. On making inquiries in June, 1899, at the Jesuits'\r\nSeminary in Amiens, one of the faculty, after consultation with the\r\nFather Superior, kindly gave us in writing the following information as\r\nto the exact date: \"The registers of the great seminary were carried\r\naway during the French Revolution, and we do not know whither they have\r\nbeen transported, and whether they still exist to-day. Besides, it is\r\nvery doubtful whether Lamarck resided here, because only ecclesiastics\r\npreparing for receiving orders were received in the seminary. Do you not\r\nconfound the seminary with the ancient college of Rue Poste de Paris,\r\ncollege now destroyed?\"\r\n\r\n[9] We are following the _Éloge_ of Cuvier almost verbatim, also\r\nreproduced in the biographical notice in the _Revue biographique de la\r\nSociété Malacologique de France_, said to have been prepared by J. R.\r\nBourguignat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSTUDENT LIFE AND BOTANICAL CAREER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe profession of arms had not led Lamarck to forget the principles of\r\nphysical science which he had received at college. During his sojourn at\r\nMonaco the singular vegetation of that rocky country had attracted his\r\nattention, and Chomel's _Traité des Plantes usuelles_ accidentally\r\nfalling into his hands had given him some smattering of botany.\r\n\r\nLodged at Paris, as he has himself said, in a room much higher up than\r\nhe could have wished, the clouds, almost the only objects to be seen\r\nfrom his windows, interested him by their ever-changing shapes, and\r\ninspired in him his first ideas of meteorology. There were not wanting\r\nother objects to excite interest in a mind which had always been\r\nremarkably active and original. He then realized, to quote from his\r\nbiographer, Cuvier, what Voltaire said of Condorcet, that solid enduring\r\ndiscoveries can shed a lustre quite different from that of a commander\r\nof a company of infantry. He resolved to study some profession. This\r\nlast resolution was but little less courageous than the first. Reduced\r\nto a pension (_pension alimentaire_) of only 400 francs a year, he\r\nattempted to study medicine, and while waiting until he had the time to\r\ngive to the necessary studies, he worked in the dreary office of a\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nThe meditations, the thoughts and aspirations of a contemplative nature\r\nlike his, in his hours of work or leisure, in some degree consoled the\r\nbudding philosopher during this period of uncongenial labor, and when he\r\ndid have an opportunity of communicating his ideas to his friends, of\r\ndiscussing them, of defending them against objection, the hardships of\r\nhis workaday life were for the time forgotten. In his ardor for science\r\nall the uncongenial experiences of his life as a bank clerk vanished.\r\nLike many another rising genius in art, literature, or science, his zeal\r\nfor knowledge and investigation in those days of grinding poverty fed\r\nthe fires of his genius, and this was the light which throughout his\r\nlong poverty-stricken life shed a golden lustre on his toilsome\r\nexistence. He did not then know that the great Linné, the father of the\r\nscience he was to illuminate and so greatly to expand, also began life\r\nin extreme poverty, and eked out his scanty livelihood by mending over\r\nagain for his own use the cast-off shoes of his fellow-students.\r\n(Cuvier.)\r\n\r\nBourguin[10] tells us that Lamarck's medical course lasted four years,\r\nand this period of severe study--for he must have made it\r\nsuch--evidently laid the best possible foundation that Paris could then\r\nafford for his after studies. He seems, however, to have wavered in his\r\nintentions of making medicine his life work, for he possessed a decided\r\ntaste for music. His eldest brother, the Chevalier de Bazentin, strongly\r\nopposed, and induced him to abandon this project, though not without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nAt about this time the two brothers lived in a quiet village[11] near\r\nParis, and there for a year they studied together science and history.\r\nAnd now happened an event which proved to be the turning point, or\r\nrather gave a new and lasting impetus to Lamarck's career and decided\r\nhis vocation in life. In one of their walks they met the philosopher and\r\nsentimentalist, Jean Jacques Rousseau. We know little about Lamarck's\r\nacquaintance with this genius, for all the details of his life, both in\r\nhis early and later years, are pitifully scanty. Lamarck, however, had\r\nattended at the Jardin du Roi a botanical course, and now, having by\r\ngood fortune met Rousseau, he probably improved the acquaintance, and,\r\nfound by Rousseau to be a congenial spirit, he was soon invited to\r\naccompany him in his herborizations.\r\n\r\nStill more recently Professor Giard[12] has unearthed from the works of\r\nRousseau the following statement by him regarding species: \"Est-ce qu'à\r\nproprement parler il n'existerait point d'espèces dans la nature, mais\r\nseulement des individus?\"[13] In his _Discours sur l'Inégalité parmi les\r\nHommes_ is the following passage, which shows, as Giard says, that\r\nRousseau perfectly understood the influence of the _milieu_ and of wants\r\non the organism; and this brilliant writer seems to have been the first\r\nto suggest natural selection, though only in the case of man, when he\r\nsays that the weaker in Sparta were eliminated in order that the\r\nsuperior and stronger of the race might survive and be maintained.\r\n\r\n  \"Accustomed from infancy to the severity of the weather and the\r\n  rigors of the seasons, trained to undergo fatigue, and obliged to\r\n  defend naked and without arms their life and their prey against\r\n  ferocious beasts, or to escape them by flight, the men acquired an\r\n  almost invariably robust temperament; the infants, bringing into the\r\n  world the strong constitution of their fathers, and strengthening\r\n  themselves by the same kind of exercise as produced it, have thus\r\n  acquired all the vigor of which the human species is capable. Nature\r\n  uses them precisely as did the law of Sparta the children of her\r\n  citizens. She rendered strong and robust those with a good\r\n  constitution, and destroyed all the others. Our societies differ in\r\n  this respect, where the state, in rendering the children burdensome\r\n  to the father, indirectly kills them before birth.\"[14]\r\n\r\nSoon Lamarck abandoned not only a military career, but also music,\r\nmedicine, and the bank, and devoted himself exclusively to science. He\r\nwas now twenty-four years old, and, becoming a student of botany under\r\nBernard de Jussieu, for ten years gave unremitting attention to this\r\nscience, and especially to a study of the French flora.\r\n\r\nCuvier states that the _Flore Française_ appeared after \"six months of\r\nunremitting labor.\" However this may be, the results of over nine\r\npreceding years of study, gathered together, written, and printed within\r\nthe brief period of half a year, was no hasty _tour de force_, but a\r\nwell-matured, solid work which for many years remained a standard one.\r\n\r\nIt brought him immediate fame. It appeared at a fortunate epoch. The\r\nexample of Rousseau and the general enthusiasm he inspired had made the\r\nstudy of flowers very popular--\"_une science à la mode_,\" as Cuvier\r\nsays--even among many ladies and in the world of fashion, so that the\r\nnew work of Lamarck, though published in three octavo volumes, had a\r\nrapid success.\r\n\r\nThe preface was written by Daubenton.[15] Buffon also took much interest\r\nin the work, opposing as it did the artificial system of Linné, for whom\r\nhe had, for other reasons, no great degree of affection. He obtained the\r\nprivilege of having the work published at the royal printing office at\r\nthe expense of the government, and the total proceeds of the sale of the\r\nvolumes were given to the author. This elaborate work at once placed\r\nyoung Lamarck in the front rank of botanists, and now the first and\r\ngreatest honor of his life came to him. The young lieutenant,\r\ndisappointed in a military advancement, won his spurs in the field of\r\nscience. A place in botany had become vacant at the Academy of Sciences,\r\nand M. de Lamarck having been presented in the second rank (_en seconde\r\nligne_), the ministry, a thing almost unexampled, caused him to be given\r\nby the king, in 1779, the preference over M. Descemet, whose name was\r\npresented before his, in the first rank, and who since then, and during\r\na long life, never could recover the place which he unjustly lost.[16]\r\n\"In a word, the poor officer, so neglected since the peace, obtained at\r\none stroke the good fortune, always very rare, and especially so at that\r\ntime, of being both the recipient of the favor of the Court and of the\r\npublic.\"[17]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMARCK AT THE AGE OF 35 YEARS]\r\n\r\nThe interest and affection felt for him by Buffon were of advantage to\r\nhim in another way. Desiring to have his son, whom he had planned to be\r\nhis successor as Intendant of the Royal Garden, and who had just\r\nfinished his studies, enjoy the advantage of travel in foreign lands,\r\nBuffon proposed to Lamarck to go with him as a guide and friend; and,\r\nnot wishing him to appear as a mere teacher, he procured for him, in\r\n1781, a commission as Royal Botanist, charged with visiting the foreign\r\nbotanical gardens and museums, and of placing them in communication with\r\nthose of Paris. His travels extended through portions of the years 1781\r\nand 1782.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own statement,[18] in pursuit of this object he\r\ncollected not only rare and interesting plants which were wanting in the\r\nRoyal Garden, but also minerals and other objects of natural history new\r\nto the Museum. He went to Holland, Germany, Hungary, etc., visiting\r\nuniversities, botanical gardens, and museums of natural history. He\r\nexamined the mines of the Hartz in Hanover, of Freyburg in Saxony, of\r\nChemnitz and of Cremnitz in Hungary, making there numerous observations\r\nwhich he incorporated in his work on physics, and sent collections of\r\nores, minerals, and seeds to Paris. He also made the acquaintance of the\r\nbotanists Gleditsch at Berlin, Jacquin at Vienna, and Murray at\r\nGöttingen. He obtained some idea of the magnificent establishments in\r\nthese countries devoted to botany, \"and which,\" he says, \"ours do not\r\nyet approach, in spite of all that had been done for them during the\r\nlast thirty years.\"[19]\r\n\r\nOn his return, as he writes, he devoted all his energies and time to\r\nresearch and to carrying out his great enterprises in botany; as he\r\nstated: \"Indeed, for the last ten years my works have obliged me to keep\r\nin constant activity a great number of artists, such as draughtsmen,\r\nengravers, and printers.\"[20]\r\n\r\nBut the favor of Buffon, powerful as his influence was,[21] together\r\nwith the aid of the minister, did not avail to give Lamarck a permanent\r\nsalaried position. Soon after his return from his travels, however, M.\r\nd'Angiviller, the successor of Buffon as Intendant of the Royal Garden,\r\nwho was related to Lamarck's family, created for him the position of\r\nkeeper of the herbarium of the Royal Garden, with the paltry salary of\r\n1,000 francs.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same _État_, Lamarck had now been attached to the Royal\r\nGarden five years. In 1789 he received as salary only 1,000 livres or\r\nfrancs; in 1792 it was raised to the sum of 1,800 livres.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] _Les Grand Naturalists Français au Commencement du XIX Siècle._\r\n\r\n[11] Was this quiet place in the region just out of Paris possibly near\r\nMont Valérien? He must have been about twenty-two years old when he met\r\nRousseau and began to study botany seriously. His _Flore Française_\r\nappeared in 1778, when he was thirty-four years old. Rousseau, at the\r\nend of his checkered life, from 1770 to 1778, lived in Paris. He often\r\nbotanized in the suburbs; and Mr. Morley, in his _Rousseau_, says that\r\n\"one of his greatest delights was to watch Mont Valérien in the sunset\"\r\n(p. 436). Rousseau died in Paris in 1778. That Rousseau expressed\r\nhimself vaguely in favor of evolution is stated by Isidore Geoffroy\r\nSt. Hilaire, who quotes a \"_Phrase, malheureusement un peu ambiguë, qui\r\nsemble montrer, dans se grand écrivain, un partisan de plus de la\r\nvariabilité du type_.\" (_Résumé des Vues sur l'espèce organique_, p. 18,\r\nParis, 1889.) The passage is quoted in Geoffroy's _Histoire Naturelle\r\nGénérale des Règnes organiques_, ii., ch. I., p. 271. I have been unable\r\nto verify this quotation.\r\n\r\n[12] _Leçon d'Ouverture du Cours de l'Évolution des Êtres organisés._\r\nParis, 1888.\r\n\r\n[13] _Dictionnaire des Termes de la Botanique._ Art.

(Hamy,\r\n_l. c._, p. 12.)\r\n\r\n[16] De Mortillet (_Lamarck. Par un Groupe de Transformistes_, p. 11)\r\nstates that Lamarck was elected to the Academy at the age of thirty; but\r\nas he was born in 1744, and the election took place in 1779, he must\r\nhave been thirty-five years of age.\r\n\r\n[17] Cuvier's _Éloge_, p. viii.; also _Revue biographique de la Société\r\nMalacologique_, p. 67.\r\n\r\n[18] See letters to the Committee of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\n[19] Cuvier's _Éloge_, p. viii; also Bourguignat in _Revue biog. Soc.\r\nMalacologique_, p. 67.\r\n\r\n[20] He received no remuneration for this service. As was afterwards\r\nstated in the National Archives, _État des personnes attachées au Muséum\r\nNational d'Histoire Naturelle a l'époque du messidor an II de la\r\nRépublique_, he \"sent to this establishment seeds of rare plants,\r\ninteresting minerals, and observations made during his travels in\r\nHolland, Germany, and in France. He did not receive any compensation for\r\nthis service.\"\r\n\r\n[21] \"The illustrious Intendant of the Royal Garden and Cabinet had\r\nconcentrated in his hands the most varied and extensive powers. Not only\r\ndid he hold, like his predecessors, the _personnel_ of the establishment\r\nentirely at his discretion, but he used the appropriations which were\r\nvoted to him with a very great independence. Thanks to the universal\r\nrenown which he had acquired both in science and in literature, Buffon\r\nmaintained with the men who succeeded one another in office relations\r\nwhich enabled him to do almost anything he liked at the Royal Garden.\"\r\nHis manner to public men, as Condorcet said, was conciliatory and\r\ntactful, and to his subordinates he was modest and unpretending.\r\n(Professor G. T. Hamy, _Les Derniers Jours du Jardin du Roi_, etc.,\r\np. 3.) Buffon, after nearly fifty years of service as Intendant, died\r\nApril 16, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLAMARCK'S SHARE IN THE REORGANIZATION OF THE JARDIN DES PLANTES AND\r\nMUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in his humble position as keeper of the herbarium, with its\r\npitiable compensation, Lamarck, now an eminent botanist, with a European\r\nreputation, was by no means appreciated or secure in his position. He\r\nwas subjected to many worries, and, already married and with several\r\nchildren, suffered from a grinding poverty. His friend and supporter,\r\nLa Billarderie, was a courtier, with much influence at the Tuileries,\r\nbut as Intendant of the Royal Garden without the least claim to\r\nscientific fitness for the position; and in 1790 he was on the point of\r\ndischarging Lamarck.[22] On the 20th of August the Finance Committee\r\nreduced the expenses of the Royal Garden and Cabinet, and, while raising\r\nthe salary of the professor of botany, to make good the deficiency thus\r\nensuing suppressed the position of keeper of the herbarium, filled by\r\nLamarck. Lamarck, on learning of this, acted promptly, and though in\r\nthis cavalier way stricken off from the rolls of the Royal Garden, he\r\nat once prepared, printed, and distributed among the members of the\r\nNational Assembly an energetic claim for restoration to his office.[23]\r\nHis defence formed two brochures; in one he gave an account of his life,\r\ntravels, and works, and in the other he showed that the place which he\r\nfilled was a pressing necessity, and could not be conveniently or\r\nusefully added to that of the professor of botany, who was already\r\noverworked.\r\n\r\nThis manly and able plea in his own defence also comprised a broad,\r\ncomprehensive plan for the organization and development of a great\r\nnational museum, combining both vast collections and adequate means of\r\npublic instruction. The paper briefly stated, in courteous language,\r\nwhat he wished to say to public men, in general animated with good\r\nintentions, but little versed in the study of the sciences and the\r\nknowledge of their application. It praised, in fit terms, the work of\r\nthe National Assembly, and gave, without too much emphasis, the\r\nassurance of an entire devotion to the public business. Then in a very\r\nclear and comprehensive way were given all the kinds of service which an\r\nestablishment like the Royal Garden should render to the sciences and\r\narts, and especially to agriculture, medicine, commerce, etc. Museums,\r\ngalleries, and botanical gardens; public lectures and demonstrations in\r\nthe museum and school of botany; an office for giving information, the\r\ndistribution of seeds, etc.--all the resources already so varied, as\r\nwell as the facilities for work at the Jardin, passed successively in\r\nreview before the representatives of the country, and the address ended\r\nin a modest request to the Assembly that its author be allowed a few\r\ndays to offer some observations regarding the future organization of\r\nthis great institution.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, adopting the wise views announced in the manifest which\r\nhad been presented by the officers of the Jardin and Cabinet, sent the\r\naddress to the Committee, and gave a month's time to the petitioners to\r\nprepare and present a plan and regulations which should establish the\r\norganization of their establishment.[24]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1790 that the decisive step was taken by the officers of the\r\nRoyal Garden[25] and Cabinet of Natural History which led to the\r\norganization of the present Museum of Natural History as it is to-day.\r\nThroughout the proceedings, Lamarck, as at the outset, took a prominent\r\npart, his address having led the Assembly to invite the officers of the\r\ndouble establishment to draw up rules for its government.\r\n\r\nThe officers met together August 23d, and their distrust and hostility\r\nagainst the Intendant were shown by their nomination of Daubenton, the\r\nNestor of the French savants, to the presidency, although\r\nLa Billarderie, as representing the royal authority, was present at the\r\nmeeting. At the second meeting (August 24th) he took no part in the\r\nproceedings, and absented himself from the third, held on August 27,\r\n1790. It will be seen that even while the office of Intendant lasted,\r\nthat official took no active part in the meetings or in the work of the\r\ninstitution, and from that day to this it has been solely under the\r\nmanagement of a director and scientific corps of professors, all of them\r\noriginal investigators as well as teachers. Certainly the most practical\r\nand efficient sort of organization for such an establishment.[26]\r\n\r\nLamarck, though holding a place subordinate to the other officers, was\r\npresent, as the records of the proceedings of the officers of the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes at this meeting show.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle of 1791, the Intendant, La Billarderie, after \"four\r\nyears of incapacity,\" placed his resignation in the hands of the king.\r\nThe Minister of the Interior, instead of nominating Daubenton as\r\nIntendant, reserved the place for a _protégé_, and, July 1, 1791, sent\r\nin the name of Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, the\r\ndistinguished author of _Paul et Virginie_ and of _Études sur la\r\nNature_. The new Intendant was literary in his tastes, fond of nature,\r\nbut not a practical naturalist. M. Hamy wittily states that \"Bernardin\r\nSaint-Pierre contemplated and dreamed, and in his solitary meditations\r\nhad imagined a system of the world which had nothing in common with that\r\nwhich was to be seen in the Faubourg Saint Victor, and one can readily\r\nimagine the welcome that the officers of the Jardin gave to the singular\r\nnaturalist the Tuileries had sent them.\"[27]\r\n\r\nLamarck suffered an indignity from the intermeddling of this second\r\nIntendant of the Jardin. In his budget of expenses[28] sent to the\r\nMinister of the Interior, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre took occasion to\r\nrefer to Lamarck in a disingenuous and blundering way, which may have\r\nboth amused and disgusted him.\r\n\r\nBut the last days of the Jardin du Roi were drawing to a close, and a\r\nnew era in French natural science, signalized by the reorganization of\r\nthe Jardin and Cabinet under the name of the _Muséum d'Histoire\r\nNaturelle_, was dawning. On the 6th of February, 1793, the National\r\nConvention, at the request of Lakanal,[29] ordered the Committees of\r\nPublic Instruction and of Finances to at once make a report on the new\r\norganization of the administration of the Jardin des Plantes.\r\n\r\nLakanal consulted with Daubenton, and inquired into the condition and\r\nneeds of the establishment; Daubenton placed in his hands the brochure\r\nof 1790, written by Lamarck. The next day Lakanal, after a short\r\nconference with his colleagues of the Committee of Public Instruction,\r\nread in the tribune a short report and a decree which the Committee\r\nadopted without discussion.\r\n\r\nTheir minds were elsewhere, for grave news had come in from all\r\nquarters. The Austrians were bombarding Valenciennes, the Prussians had\r\ninvested Mayence, the Spanish were menacing Perpignan, and bands of\r\nVendeans had seized Saumur after a bloody battle; while at Caen, at\r\nEvreux, at Bordeaux, at Marseilles, and elsewhere, muttered the thunders\r\nof the outbreaks provoked by the proscription of the Girondins. So that\r\nunder these alarming conditions the decree of the 10th of June, in\r\nspite of its importance to science and higher learning in France, was\r\npassed without discussion.\r\n\r\nIn his _Lamarck_ De Mortillet states explicitly that Lamarck, in his\r\naddress of 1790, changed the name of the Jardin du Roi to Jardin des\r\nPlantes.[30] As the article states, \"Entirely devoted to his studies,\r\nLamarck entered into no intrigue under the falling monarchy, so he\r\nalways remained in a position straitened and inferior to his merits.\" It\r\nwas owing to this and his retired mode of life that the single-minded\r\nstudent of nature was not disturbed in his studies and meditations by\r\nthe Revolution. And when the name of the Jardin du Roi threatened to be\r\nfatal to this establishment, it was he who presented a memoir to\r\ntransform it, under the name of Jardin des Plantes, into an institution\r\nof higher instruction, with six professors. In 1793, Lakanal adopted\r\nLamarck's plan, and, enlarging upon it, created twelve chairs for the\r\nteaching of the natural sciences.\r\n\r\nBourguin thus puts the matter:\r\n\r\n  \"In June, 1793, Lakanal, having learned that 'the Vandals' (that is\r\n  his expression) had demanded of the tribune of the Convention the\r\n  suppression of the Royal Garden, as being an annex of the king's\r\n  palace, recurred to the memoirs of Lamarck presented in 1790 and\r\n  gave his plan of organization. He inspired himself with Lamarck's\r\n  ideas, but enlarged upon them. Instead of six positions of\r\n  professors-administrative, which Lamarck asked for, Lakanal\r\n  established twelve chairs for the teaching of different branches of\r\n  natural science.\"[31]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] Another intended victim of La Billarderie, whose own salary had\r\nbeen at the same time reduced, was Faujas de Saint-Fond, one of the\r\nfounders of geology. But his useful discoveries in economic geology\r\nhaving brought him distinction, the king had generously pensioned him,\r\nand he was retained in office on the printed _État_ distributed by the\r\nCommittee of Finance. (Hamy, _l. c._, p. 29.)\r\n\r\n[23] Hamy, _l. c._, p. 29. This brochure, of which I possess a copy, is\r\na small quarto pamphlet of fifteen pages, signed, on the last page,\r\n\"_J. B. Lamarck, ancien Officier au Régiment de Beaujolais, de\r\nl'Académie des Sciences de Paris, Botaniste attaché au Cabinet\r\nd'Histoire Naturelle du Jardin des Plantes_.\"\r\n\r\n[24] Hamy, _l. c._, p. 31; also _Pièces Justificatives_, Nos. 11 _et_\r\n12, pp. 97-101. The Intendant of the Garden was completely ignored, and\r\nhis unpopularity and inefficiency led to his resignation. But meanwhile,\r\nin his letter to Condorcet, the perpetual Secretary of the Institute of\r\nFrance, remonstrating against the proposed suppression by the Assembly\r\nof the place of Intendant, he partially retracted his action against\r\nLamarck, saying that Lamarck's work, \"_peut être utile, mais n'est pas\r\nabsolutement nécessaire_.\" The Intendant, as Hamy adds, knew well the\r\nvalue of the services rendered by Lamarck at the Royal Garden, and that,\r\nas a partial recompense, he had been appointed botanist to the museum.\r\nHe also equally well knew that the author of the _Flore Française_ was\r\nin a most precarious situation and supported on his paltry salary a\r\nfamily of seven persons, as he was already at this time married and had\r\nfive children. \"But his own place was in peril, and he did not hesitate\r\nto sacrifice the poor savant whom he had himself installed as keeper of\r\nthe herbarium.\" (Hamy, _l. c._, pp. 34, 35.)\r\n\r\n[25] The first idea of the foundation of the Jardin dates from 1626, but\r\nthe actual carrying out of the conception was in 1635. The first act of\r\ninstallation took place in 1640. Gui de la Brosse, in order to please\r\nhis high protectors, the first physicians of the king, named his\r\nestablishment _Jardin des Plantes Medicinales_. It was renovated by\r\nFagon, who was born in the Jardin, and whose mother was the niece of Gui\r\nde la Brosse. By his disinterestedness, activity, and great scientific\r\ncapacity, he regenerated the garden, and under his administration\r\nflourished the great professors, Duverney, Tournefort, Geoffroy the\r\nchemist, and others (Perrier, _l. c._, p. 59). Fagon was\r\nsucceeded by Buffon, \"the new legislator and second founder.\"\r\nHis Intendancy lasted from 1739 to 1788.\r\n\r\n[26] Three days after, August 30th, the report was ready, the discussion\r\nbegan, and the foundations of the new organization were definitely laid.\r\n\"No longer any Jardin or Cabinets, but a Museum of Natural History,\r\nwhose aim was clearly defined. No officers with unequal functions; all\r\nare professors and all will give instruction. They elect themselves and\r\npresent to the king _a candidate for each vacant place_. _Finally, the\r\ngeneral administration of the Museum will be confided to the officers of\r\nthe establishment_, this implying the suppression of the Intendancy.\"\r\n(Hamy, _l. c._, p. 37.)\r\n\r\n[27] Hamy, _l. c._, p. 37. The Faubourg Saint Victor was a part of the\r\nQuartier Latin, and included the Jardin des Plantes.\r\n\r\n[28] _Devis de la Dépense du Jardin National des Plantes et du Cabinet\r\nd'Histoire Naturelle pour l'Année 1793_, presented to the National\r\nConvention by Citoyen Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. In it appeared a note\r\nrelative to Lamarck, which, after stating that, though full of zeal and\r\nof knowledge of botany, his time was not entirely occupied; that for two\r\nmonths he had written him in regard to the duties of his position;\r\nreferred to the statements of two of his seniors, who repeated the old\r\ngossip as to the claim of La Billarderie that his place was useless, and\r\nalso found fault with him for not recognizing the artificial system of\r\nLinné in the arrangement of the herbarium, added: \"However, desirous of\r\nretaining M. La Marck, father of six children, in the position which he\r\nneeds, and not wishing to let his talents be useless, after several\r\nconversations with the older officers of the Jardin, I have believed\r\nthat, M. Desfontaines being charged with the botanical lectures in the\r\nschool, and M. Jussieu in the neighborhood of Paris, it would be well to\r\nsend M. La Marck to herborize in some parts of the kingdom, in order to\r\ncomplete the French flora, as this will be to his taste, and at the same\r\ntime very useful to the progress of botany; thus everybody will be\r\nemployed and satisfied.\"--Perrier, _Lamarck et le Transformisme Actuel_,\r\npp. 13, 14. (Copied from the National Archives.) \"The life of Bernardin\r\nde St. Pierre (1737-1814) was nearly as irregular as that of his friend\r\nand master [Rousseau]. But his character was essentially crafty and\r\nselfish, like that of many other sentimentalists of the first order.\"\r\n(Morley's _Rousseau_, p. 437, footnote.)\r\n\r\n[29] Joseph Lakanal was born in 1762, and died in 1845. He was a\r\nprofessor of philosophy in a college of the Oratory, and doctor of the\r\nfaculty at Angers, when in 1792 he was sent as a representative\r\n(_député_) to the National Convention, and being versed in educational\r\nquestions he was placed on the Committee of Public Instruction and\r\nelected its president. He was the means, as Hamy states, of saving from\r\na lamentable destruction, by rejuvenizing them, the scientific\r\ninstitutions of ancient France. During the Revolution he voted for the\r\ndeath of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nLakanal also presented a plan of organization of a National Institute,\r\nwhat is now the Institut de France, and was charged with designating the\r\nfirst forty-eight members, who should elect all the others. He was by\r\nthe first forty-eight thus elected. Proscribed as a regicide at the\r\nsecond restoration, he sailed for the United States, where he was warmly\r\nwelcomed by Jefferson. The United States Congress voted him five hundred\r\nacres of land. The government of Louisiana offered him the presidency of\r\nits university, which, however, he did not accept. In 1825 he went to\r\nlive on the shores of Mobile Bay on land which he purchased from the\r\nproceeds of the sale of the land given him by Congress. Here he became a\r\npioneer and planter.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 he manifested a desire to return to his native country, and\r\noffered his services to the new government, but received no answer and\r\nwas completely ignored. But two years later, thanks to the initiative of\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire, who was the means of his reëlection to the French\r\nAcademy, he decided to return, and did so in 1837. He lived in\r\nretirement in Paris, where he occupied himself until his death in 1845\r\nin writing a book entitled _Séjour d'un Membre de l'Institut de France\r\naux États-Unis pendant vingt-deux ans_. The manuscript mysteriously\r\ndisappeared, no trace of it ever having been found. (Larousse, _Grand\r\nDictionnaire Universel_, Art. LAKANAL.) His bust now occupies a\r\nprominent place among those of other great men in the French Academy of\r\nSciences.\r\n\r\n[30] This is seen to be the case by the title of the pamphlet: _Mémoire\r\nsur les Cabinets d'Histoire Naturelle, et particulièrement sur celui du\r\nJardin des Plantes_.\r\n\r\n[31] Bourguin also adds that \"on one point Lamarck, with more foresight,\r\nwent farther than Lakanal. He had insisted on the necessity of the\r\nappointment of four demonstrators for zoölogy. In the decree of June 10,\r\n1793, they were even reduced to two. Afterwards they saw that this\r\nnumber was insufficient, and to-day (1863) the department of zoölogy is\r\nadministered at the museum by four professors, in conformity with the\r\ndivision indicated by Lamarck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF INVERTEBRATE ZOÖLOGY AT THE MUSEUM\r\n\r\n\r\nLamarck's career as a botanist comprised about twenty-five years. We now\r\ncome to the third stage of his life--Lamarck the zoölogist and\r\nevolutionist. He was in his fiftieth year when he assumed the duties of\r\nhis professorship of the zoölogy of the invertebrate animals; and at a\r\nperiod when many men desire rest and freedom from responsibility, with\r\nthe vigor of an intellectual giant Lamarck took upon his shoulders new\r\nlabors in an untrodden field both in pure science and philosophic\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nIt was now the summer of 1793, and on the eve of the Reign of Terror,\r\nwhen Paris, from early in October until the end of the year, was in the\r\ndeadliest throes of revolution. The dull thud of the guillotine, placed\r\nin front of the Tuileries, in the Place de la Revolution, which is now\r\nthe Place de la Concorde, a little to the east of where the obelisk of\r\nLuxor now stands, could almost be heard by the quiet workers in the\r\nMuseum, for sansculottism in its most aggressive and hideous forms raged\r\nnot far from the Jardin des Plantes, then just on the border of the\r\ndensest part of the Paris of the first Revolution. Lavoisier, the\r\nfounder of modern chemistry, was guillotined some months later. The Abbé\r\nHaüy, the founder of crystallography, had been, the year previous,\r\nrescued from prison by young Geoffroy St. Hilaire, his neck being barely\r\nsaved from the gleaming axe. Roland, the friend of science and letters,\r\nhad been so hunted down that at Rouen, in a moment of despair, on\r\nhearing of his wife's death, he thrust his sword-cane through his heart.\r\nMadame Roland had been beheaded, as also a cousin of her husband, and we\r\ncan well imagine that these fateful summer and autumn days were scarcely\r\nfavorable to scientific enterprises.[32] Still, however, amid the loud\r\nalarums of this social tempest, the Museum underwent a new birth which\r\nproved not to be untimely. The Minister of the Interior (Garat) invited\r\nthe professors of the Museum to constitute an assembly to nominate a\r\ndirector and a treasurer, and he begged them to present extracts of\r\ntheir deliberations for him to send to the executive council, \"under the\r\nsupervision of which the National Museum is for the future placed;\"\r\nthough in general the assembly only reported to the Minister matters\r\nrelating to the expenses, the first annual grant of the Museum being\r\n100,000 livres.\r\n\r\nFour days after, June 14th, the assembly met and adopted the name of the\r\nestablishment in the following terms: _Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle\r\ndécrété par la Convention Nationale le 10 Juin, 1793_; and at a meeting\r\nheld on the 9th of July the assembly definitely organized the first\r\nbureau, with Daubenton as director, Thouin treasurer, and Desfontaines\r\nsecretary. Lamarck, as the records show, was present at all these\r\nmeetings, and at the first one, June 14th, Lamarck and Fourcroy were\r\ndesignated as commissioners for the formation of the Museum library.\r\n\r\nAll this was done without the aid or presence of Bernardin\r\nde Saint-Pierre, the Intendant. The Minister of the Interior, meanwhile,\r\nhad communicated to him the decision of the National Convention, and\r\ninvited him to continue his duties up to the moment when the new\r\norganization should be established. After remaining in his office until\r\nJuly 9th, he retired from the Museum August 7th following, and finally\r\nwithdrew to the country at Essones.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Museum is the same now as in 1793, having for\r\nover a century been the chief biological centre of France, and with its\r\nmagnificent collections was never more useful in the advancement of\r\nscience than at this moment.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the composition of the assembly of professors, which\r\nformed the Board of Administration of the Museum at the time of his\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nThe associates of Lamarck and Geoffroy St. Hilaire, who had already been\r\nconnected with the Royal Garden and Cabinet, were Daubenton, Thouin,\r\nDesfontaines, Portal, and Mertrude. The Nestor of the faculty was\r\nDaubenton, who was born in 1716. He was the collaborator of Buffon in\r\nthe first part of his _Histoire Naturelle_, and the author of treatises\r\non the mammals and of papers on the bats and other mammals, also on\r\nreptiles, together with embryological and anatomical essays. Thouin, the\r\nprofessor of horticulture, was the veteran gardener and architect of the\r\nJardin des Plantes, and withal a most useful man. He was affable,\r\nmodest, genial, greatly beloved by his students, a man of high\r\ncharacter, and possessing much executive ability. A street near the\r\nJardin was named after him. He was succeeded by Bosc. Desfontaines\r\nhad the chair of botany, but his attainments as a botanist were\r\nmediocre, and his lectures were said to have been tame and\r\nuninteresting. Portal taught human anatomy, while Mertrude lectured on\r\nvertebrate anatomy; his chair was filled by Cuvier in 1795.\r\n\r\nOf this group Lamarck was _facile princeps_, as he combined great\r\nsagacity and experience as a systematist with rare intellectual and\r\nphilosophic traits. For this reason his fame has perhaps outlasted that\r\nof his young contemporary, Geoffroy St. Hilaire.\r\n\r\nThe necessities of the Museum led to the division of the chair of\r\nzoölogy, botany being taught by Desfontaines. And now began a new\r\nera in the life of Lamarck. After twenty-five years spent in botanical\r\nresearch he was compelled, as there seemed nothing else for him to\r\nundertake, to assume charge of the collection of invertebrate animals,\r\nand to him was assigned that enormous, chaotic mass of forms then known\r\nas molluscs, insects, worms, and microscopic animals. Had he continued\r\nto teach botany, we might never have had the Lamarck of biology and\r\nbiological philosophy. But turned adrift in a world almost unexplored,\r\nhe faced the task with his old-time bravery and dogged persistence, and\r\nat once showed the skill of a master mind in systematic work.\r\n\r\nThe two new professorships in zoölogy were filled, one by Lamarck,\r\npreviously known as a botanist, and the other by the young Étienne\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire, then twenty-two years old, who was at that time a\r\nstudent of Haüy, and in charge of the minerals, besides teaching\r\nmineralogy with especial reference to crystallography.\r\n\r\nTo Geoffroy was assigned the four classes of vertebrates, but in reality\r\nhe only occupied himself with the mammals and birds. Afterwards\r\nLacépède[33] took charge of the reptiles and fishes. On the other hand,\r\nLamarck's field comprised more than nine-tenths of the animal kingdom.\r\nAlready the collections of insects, crustacea, worms, molluscs,\r\nechinoderms, corals, etc., at the Museum were enormous. At this time\r\nFrance began to send out those exploring expeditions to all parts of the\r\nglobe which were so numerous and fruitful during the first third of the\r\nnineteenth century. The task of arranging and classifying single-handed\r\nthis enormous mass of material was enough to make a young man quail, and\r\nit is a proof of the vigor, innate ability, and breadth of view of the\r\nman that in this pioneer work he not only reduced to some order this\r\nvast horde of forms, but showed such insight and brought about such\r\nradical reforms in zoölogical classification, especially in the\r\nfoundation and limitation of certain classes, an insight no one before\r\nhim had evinced. To him and to Latreille much of the value of the _Règne\r\nAnimal_ of Cuvier, as regards invertebrate classes, is due.\r\n\r\nThe exact title of the chair held by Lamarck is given in the _État_ of\r\npersons attached to the National Museum of Natural History at the date\r\nof the 1er messidor, an II. of the Republic (1794), where he is\r\nmentioned as follows: \"LAMARCK--fifty years old; married for the second\r\ntime; wife _enceinte_; six children; professor of zoölogy, of insects,\r\nof worms, and microscopic animals.\" His salary, like that of the other\r\nprofessors, was put at 2,868 livres, 6 sous, 8 deniers.[34]\r\n\r\nÉtienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire[35] has related how the professorship was\r\ngiven to Lamarck.\r\n\r\n  \"The law of 1793 had prescribed that all parts of the natural\r\n  sciences should be equally taught. The insects, shells, and an\r\n  infinity of organisms--a portion of creation still almost\r\n  unknown--remained to be treated in such a course. A desire to comply\r\n  with the wishes of his colleagues, members of the administration,\r\n  and without doubt, also, the consciousness of his powers as an\r\n  investigator, determined M. de Lamarck: this task, so great, and\r\n  which would tend to lead him into numberless researches; this\r\n  friendless, unthankful task he accepted--courageous resolution,\r\n  which has resulted in giving us immense undertakings and great and\r\n  important works, among which posterity will distinguish and honor\r\n  forever the work which, entirely finished and collected into seven\r\n  volumes, is known under the name of _Animaux sans Vertèbres_.\"\r\n\r\nBefore his appointment to this chair Lamarck had devoted considerable\r\nattention to the study of conchology, and already possessed a rather\r\nlarge collection of shells. His last botanical paper appeared in 1800,\r\nbut practically his botanical studies were over by 1793.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the Revolution, namely, from 1789 to and\r\nincluding 1791, Lamarck published nothing. Whether this was naturally\r\ndue to the social convulsions and turmoil which raged around the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes, or to other causes, is not known. In 1792, however, Lamarck\r\nand his friends and colleagues, Bruguière, Olivier, and the Abbé Haüy,\r\nfounded the _Journal d'Histoire Naturelle_, which contains nineteen\r\nbotanical articles, two on shells, besides one on physics, by Lamarck.\r\nThese, with many articles by other men of science, illustrated by\r\nplates, indicate that during the years of social unrest and upheaval in\r\nParis, and though France was also engaged in foreign wars, the\r\nphilosophers preserved in some degree, at least, the traditional calm of\r\ntheir profession, and passed their days and nights in absorption in\r\nmatters biological and physical. In 1801 appeared his _Système des\r\nAnimaux sans Vertèbres_, preceded by the opening discourse of his\r\nlectures on the lower animals, in which his views on the origin of\r\nspecies were first propounded. During the years 1793-1798, or for a\r\nperiod of six years, he published nothing on zoölogy, and during this\r\ntime only one paper appeared, in 1798, on the influence of the moon on\r\nthe earth's atmosphere. But as his memoirs on fire and on sound were\r\npublished in 1798, it is evident that his leisure hours during this\r\nperiod, when not engaged in museum work and the preparation of his\r\nlectures, were devoted to meditations on physical and meteorological\r\nsubjects, and most probably it was towards the end of this period that\r\nhe brooded over and conceived his views on organic evolution.\r\n\r\nIt appears that he was led, in the first place, to conchological studies\r\nthrough his warm friendship for a fellow naturalist, and this is one of\r\nmany proofs of his affectionate, generous nature. The touching story is\r\ntold by Étienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire.[36]\r\n\r\n  \"It was impossible to assign him a professorship of botany. M. de\r\n  Lamarck, then forty-nine years old, accepted this change in his\r\n  scientific studies to take charge of that which everybody had\r\n  neglected; because it was, indeed, a heavy load, this branch of\r\n  natural history, where, with so varied relations, everything was to\r\n  be created. On one group he was a little prepared, but it was by\r\n  accident; a self-sacrifice to friendship was the cause. For it was\r\n  both to please his friend Bruguière as well as to penetrate more\r\n  deeply into the affections of this very reserved naturalist, and\r\n  also to converse with him in the only language which he wished to\r\n  hear, which was restricted to conversations on shells, that M. de\r\n  Lamarck had made some conchological studies. Oh, how, in 1793, did\r\n  he regret that his friend had gone to Persia! He had wished, he had\r\n  planned, that he should take the professorship which it was proposed\r\n  to create. He would at least supply his place; it was in answer to\r\n  the yearnings of his soul, and this affectionate impulse became a\r\n  fundamental element in the nature of one of the greatest of\r\n  zoölogical geniuses of our epoch.\"\r\n\r\nOnce settled in his new line of work, Lamarck, the incipient zoölogist,\r\nat a period in life when many students of less flexible and energetic\r\nnatures become either hide-bound and conservative, averse to taking up a\r\ndifferent course of study, or actually cease all work and rust\r\nout--after a half century of his life had passed, this rare spirit,\r\nburning with enthusiasm, charged like some old-time knight or explorer\r\ninto a new realm and into \"fresh fields and pastures new.\" His spirit,\r\nstill young and fresh after nearly thirty years of mental toil, so\r\nunrequited in material things, felt a new stimulus as he began to\r\ninvestigate the lower animals, so promising a field for discovery.\r\n\r\nHe said himself:\r\n\r\n  \"That which is the more singular is that the most important\r\n  phenomena to be considered have been offered to our meditations only\r\n  since the time when attention has been paid to the animals least\r\n  perfect, and when researches on the different complications of the\r\n  organization of these animals have become the principal foundation\r\n  of their study. It is not less singular to realize that it was\r\n  almost always from the examination of the smallest objects which\r\n  nature presents to us, and that of considerations which seem to us\r\n  the most minute, that we have obtained the most important knowledge\r\n  to enable us to arrive at the discovery of her laws, and to\r\n  determine her course.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a year of preparation he opened his course at the Museum in the\r\nspring of 1794. In his introductory lecture, given in 1803, after ten\r\nyears of work on the lower animals, he addressed his class in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed it is among those animals which are the most multiplied and\r\n  numerous in nature, and the most ready to regenerate themselves,\r\n  that we should seek the most instructive facts bearing on the course\r\n  of nature, and on the means she has employed in the creation of her\r\n  innumerable productions. In this case we perceive that, relatively\r\n  to the animal kingdom, we should chiefly devote our attention to the\r\n  invertebrate animals, because their enormous multiplicity in nature,\r\n  the singular diversity of their systems of organization and of their\r\n  means of multiplication, their increasing simplification, and the\r\n  extreme fugacity of those which compose the lowest orders of these\r\n  animals, show us, much better than the higher animals, the true\r\n  course of nature, and the means which she has used and which she\r\n  still unceasingly employs to give existence to all the living bodies\r\n  of which we have knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this decade (1793-1803) and the one succeeding, Lamarck's mind\r\ngrew and expanded. Before 1801, however much he may have brooded over\r\nthe matter, we have no utterances in print on the transformation theory.\r\nHis studies on the lower animals, and his general knowledge of the\r\nvertebrates derived from the work of his contemporaries and his\r\nobservations in the Museum and menagerie, gave him a broad grasp of the\r\nentire animal kingdom, such as no one before him had. As the result, his\r\ncomprehensive mind, with its powers of rapid generalization, enabled him\r\nto appreciate the series from monad (his _ébauche_) to man, the range of\r\nforms from the simple to the complex. Even though not a comparative\r\nanatomist like Cuvier, he made use of the latter's discoveries, and\r\ncould understand and appreciate the gradually increasing complexity of\r\nforms; and, unlike Cuvier, realize that they were blood relations, and\r\nnot separate, piece-meal creations. Animal life, so immeasurably higher\r\nthan vegetable forms, with its highly complex physiological functions\r\nand varied means of reproduction, and the relations of its forms to each\r\nother and to the world around, affords facts for evolution which were\r\nnovel to Lamarck, the descriptive botanist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF LAMARCK. REAR VIEW, FROM THE WEST]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAISON DE BUFFON, IN WHICH LAMARCK LIVED IN PARIS.\r\n1793-1829]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the rules of the Museum, which required that all the\r\nprofessors should be lodged within the limits of the Jardin, the choice\r\nof lodgings being given to the oldest professors, Lamarck, at the time\r\nof his appointment, took up his abode in the house now known as the\r\nMaison de Buffon, situated on the opposite side of the Jardin des\r\nPlantes from the house afterwards inhabited by Cuvier, and in the angle\r\nbetween the Galerie de Zoologie and the Museum library.[37] With little\r\ndoubt the windows of his study, where his earlier addresses, the\r\n_Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps Vivans_, and the _Philosophie\r\nZoologique_, were probably written, looked out upon what is now the\r\ncourt on the westerly side of the house, that facing the Rue Geoffroy\r\nSt. Hilaire.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his entering on his duties as professor of zoölogy,\r\nLamarck was in his fiftieth year. He had married twice and was the\r\nfather of six children, and without fortune. He married for a third, and\r\nafterwards for a fourth time, and in all, seven children were born to\r\nhim, as in the year (1794) the minute referring to his request for an\r\nindemnity states: \"Il est chargé de sept enfans dont un est sur les\r\nvaisseaux de la République.\" Another son was an artist, as shown by the\r\nrecords of the Assembly of the Museum for September 23, 1814, when he\r\nasked for a chamber in the lodgings of Thouin, for the use of his son,\r\n\"_peintre_.\"\r\n\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire, in 1829, spoke of one of his sons, M. Auguste de\r\nLamarck, as a skilful and highly esteemed engineer of Ponts-et-Chaussées,\r\nthen advantageously situated.\r\n\r\nBut man cannot live by scientific researches and philosophic meditations\r\nalone. The history of Lamarck's life is painful from beginning to end.\r\nWith his large family and slender salary he was never free from carking\r\ncares and want. On the 30 fructidor, an II. of the Republic, the\r\nNational Convention voted the sum of 300,000 livres, with which an\r\nindemnity was to be paid to citizens eminent in literature and art.\r\nLamarck had sacrificed much time and doubtless some money in the\r\npreparation and publication of his works, and he felt that he had a just\r\nclaim to be placed on the list of those who had been useful to the\r\nRepublic, and at the same time could give proof of their good\r\ncitizenship, and of their right to receive such indemnity or\r\nappropriation.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in 1795 he sent in a letter, which possesses much\r\nautobiographical interest, to the Committee of Public Instruction, in\r\nwhich he says:\r\n\r\n  \"During the twenty-six years that he has lived in Paris the citizen\r\n  Lamarck has unceasingly devoted himself to the study of natural\r\n  history, and particularly botany. He has done it successfully, for\r\n  it is fifteen years since he published under the title of _Flore\r\n  Française_ the history and description of the plants of France, with\r\n  the mention of their properties and of their usefulness in the arts;\r\n  a work printed at the expense of the government, well received by\r\n  the public, and which now is much sought after and very rare.\" He\r\n  then describes his second great botanical undertaking, the\r\n  _Encyclopædia and Illustration of Genera_, with nine hundred plates.\r\n  He states that for ten years past he has kept busy \"a great number\r\n  of Parisian artists, three printing presses for different works,\r\n  besides delivering a course of lectures.\"\r\n\r\nThe petition was granted. At about this period a pension of twelve\r\nhundred francs from the Academy of Sciences, and which had increased to\r\nthree thousand francs, had ceased eighteen months previously to be paid\r\nto him. But at the time (an II.) Lamarck was \"chargé de sept enfans,\"\r\nand this appropriation was a most welcome addition to his small salary.\r\n\r\nThe next year (an III.) he again applied for a similar allowance from\r\nthe funds providing an indemnity for men of letters and artists \"whose\r\ntalents are useful to the Republic.\" Again referring to the _Flore\r\nFrançaise_, and his desire to prepare a second edition of it, and his\r\nother works and travels in the interest of botanical science, he says:\r\n\r\n  \"If I had been less overburdened by needs of all kinds for some\r\n  years, and especially since the suppression of my pension from the\r\n  aforesaid Academy of Sciences, I should prepare the second edition\r\n  of this useful work; and this would be, without doubt, indeed, the\r\n  opportunity of making a new present to my country.\r\n\r\n  \"Since my return to France I have worked on the completion of my\r\n  great botanical enterprises, and indeed for about ten years past my\r\n  works have obliged me to keep in constant activity a great number of\r\n  artists, such as draughtsmen, engravers, and printers. But these\r\n  important works that I have begun, and have in a well-advanced\r\n  state, have been in spite of all my efforts suspended and\r\n  practically abandoned for the last ten years. The loss of my pension\r\n  from the Academy of Sciences and the enormous increase in the price\r\n  of articles of subsistence have placed me, with my numerous family,\r\n  in a state of distress which leaves me neither the time nor the\r\n  freedom from care to cultivate science in a fruitful way.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck's collection of shells, the accumulation of nearly thirty\r\nyears,[38] was purchased by the government at the price of five thousand\r\nlivres. This sum was used by him to balance the price of a national\r\nestate for which he had contracted by virtue of the law of 28 ventôse de\r\nl'an IV.[39] This little estate, which was the old domain of Beauregard,\r\nwas a modest farm-house or country-house at Héricourt-Saint-Samson, in\r\nthe Department of Seine-et-Oise, not far to the northward of Beauvais,\r\nand about fifty miles from Paris. It is probable that as a proprietor of\r\na landed property he passed the summer season, or a part of it, on this\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nThis request was, we may believe, made from no unworthy or mercenary\r\nmotive, but because he thought that such an indemnity was his due. Some\r\nyears after (in 1809) the chair of zoölogy, newly formed by the Faculté\r\ndes Sciences in Paris, was offered to him. Desirable as the salary would\r\nhave been in his straitened circumstances, he modestly refused the\r\noffer, because he felt unable at that time of life (he was, however, but\r\nsixty-five years of age) to make the studies required worthily to occupy\r\nthe position.\r\n\r\nOne of Lamarck's projects, which he was never able to carry out, for it\r\nwas even then quite beyond the powers of any man single-handed to\r\nundertake, was his _Système de la Nature_. We will let him describe it\r\nin his own words, especially since the account is somewhat\r\nautobiographical. It is the second memoir he addressed to the Committee\r\nof Public Instruction of the National Convention, dated 4 vendémiaire,\r\nl'an III. (1795):\r\n\r\n  \"In my first memoir I have given you an account of the works which I\r\n  have published and of those which I have undertaken to contribute to\r\n  the progress of natural history; also of the travels and researches\r\n  which I have made.\r\n\r\n  \"But for a long time I have had in view a very important\r\n  work--perhaps better adapted for education in France than those I\r\n  have already composed or undertaken--a work, in short, which the\r\n  National Convention should without doubt order, and of which no part\r\n  could be written so advantageously as in Paris, where are to be\r\n  found abundant means for carrying it to completion.\r\n\r\n  \"This is a _Système de la Nature_, a work analogous to the _Systema\r\n  naturæ_ of Linnæus, but written in French, and presenting the\r\n  picture complete, concise, and methodical, of all the natural\r\n  productions observed up to this day. This important work (of\r\n  Linnæus), which the young Frenchmen who intend to devote themselves\r\n  to the study of natural history always require, is the object of\r\n  speculations by foreign authors, and has already passed through\r\n  thirteen different editions. Moreover, their works, which, to our\r\n  shame, we have to use, because we have none written expressly for\r\n  us, are filled (especially the last edition edited by Gmelin) with\r\n  gross mistakes, omissions of double and triple occurrence, and\r\n  errors in synonymy, and present many generic characters which are\r\n  inexact or imperceptible and many series badly divided, or genera\r\n  too numerous in species, and difficulties insurmountable to\r\n  students.\r\n\r\n  \"If the Committee of Public Instruction had the time to devote any\r\n  attention to the importance of my project, to the utility of\r\n  publishing such a work, and perhaps to the duty prescribed by the\r\n  national honor, I would say to it that, after having for a long time\r\n  reflected and meditated and determined upon the most feasible plan,\r\n  finally after having seen amassed and prepared the most essential\r\n  materials, I offer to put this beautiful project into execution. I\r\n  have not lost sight of the difficulties of this great enterprise. I\r\n  am, I believe, as well aware of them, and better, than any one else;\r\n  but I feel that I can overcome them without descending to a simple\r\n  and dishonorable compilation of what foreigners have written on the\r\n  subject. I have some strength left to sacrifice for the common\r\n  advantage; I have had some experience and practice in writing works\r\n  of this kind; my herbarium is one of the richest in existence; my\r\n  numerous collection of shells is almost the only one in France the\r\n  specimens of which are determined and named according to the method\r\n  adopted by modern naturalists--finally, I am in a position to profit\r\n  by all the aid which is to be found in the National Museum of\r\n  Natural History. With these means brought together, I can then hope\r\n  to prepare in a suitable manner this interesting work.\r\n\r\n  \"I had at first thought that the work should be executed by a\r\n  society of naturalists; but after having given this idea much\r\n  thought, and having already the example of the new encyclopædia, I\r\n  am convinced that in such a case the work would be very defective in\r\n  arrangement, without unity or plan, without any harmony of\r\n  principles, and that its composition might be interminable.\r\n\r\n  \"Written with the greatest possible conciseness, this work could not\r\n  be comprised in less than eight volumes in 8vo, namely: One volume\r\n  for the quadrupeds and birds; one volume for the reptiles and\r\n  fishes; two volumes for the insects; one volume for the worms (the\r\n  molluscs, madrepores, lithophytes, and naked worms); two volumes for\r\n  the plants; one volume for the minerals: eight volumes in all.\r\n\r\n  \"It is impossible to prepare in France a work of this nature without\r\n  having special aid from the nation, because the expense of printing\r\n  (on account of the enormous quantity of citations and figures which\r\n  it would contain) would be such that any arrangement with the\r\n  printer or the manager of the edition could not remunerate the\r\n  author for writing such an immense work.\r\n\r\n  \"If the nation should wish to print the work at its own expense, and\r\n  then give to the author the profits of the sale of this edition,\r\n  the author would be very much pleased, and would doubtless not\r\n  expect any further aid. But it would cost the nation a great deal,\r\n  and I believe that this useful project could be carried through with\r\n  greater economy.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, if the nation will give me twenty thousand francs, in a\r\n  single payment, I will take the whole responsibility, and I agree,\r\n  if I live, that before the expiration of seven years the _Système de\r\n  la Nature_ in French, with the complemental addition, the\r\n  corrections, and the convenient explanations, shall be at the\r\n  disposition of all those who love or study natural history.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] Most men of science of the Revolution, like Monge and others, were\r\nadvanced republicans, and the Chevalier Lamarck, though of noble birth,\r\nwas perhaps not without sympathy with the ideas which led to the\r\nestablishment of the republic. It is possible that in his walks and\r\nintercourse with Rousseau he may have been inspired with the new notions\r\nof liberty and equality first promulgated by that philosopher.\r\n\r\nHis studies and meditations were probably not interrupted by the events\r\nof the Terror. Stevens, in his history of the French Revolution, tells\r\nus that Paris was never gayer than in the summer of 1793, and that\r\nduring the Reign of Terror the restaurants, _cafés_, and theatres were\r\nalways full. There were never more theatres open at the same period than\r\nthen, though no single great play or opera was produced. Meanwhile the\r\ngreat painter David at this time built up a school of art and made that\r\ncity a centre for art students. Indeed the Revolution was \"a grand time\r\nfor enthusiastic young men,\" while people in general lived their\r\nordinary lives. There is little doubt, then, that the savants, except\r\nthe few who were occupied by their duties as members of the _Convention\r\nNationale_, worked away quietly at their specialties, each in his own\r\nstudy or laboratory or lecture-room.\r\n\r\n[33] Bern. Germ. Étienne, Comte de Lacépède, born in 1756, died in 1825,\r\nwas elected professor of the zoölogy of \"quadrupedes ovipares, reptiles,\r\net poissons,\" January 12, 1795 (Records of the Museum). He was the\r\nauthor of works on amphibia, reptiles, and mammals, forming\r\ncontinuations of Buffon's _Histoire Naturelle_. He also published\r\n_Histoire Naturelle des Poissons_ (1798-1803), _Histoire des Cétacés_\r\n(1804), and _Histoire Naturelle de l'Homme_ (1827), _Les Ages de la\r\nNature et Histoire de l'Espèce Humaine_, tome 2, 1830.\r\n\r\n[34] Perrier, _l. c._, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[35] _Fragments Biographiques_, p. 214.\r\n\r\n[36] _Fragments Biographiques_, p. 213.\r\n\r\n[37] A few years ago, when we formed the plan of writing his life, we\r\nwrote to friends in Paris for information as to the exact house in which\r\nLamarck lived, and received the answer that it was unknown; another\r\nproof of the neglect and forgetfulness that had followed Lamarck so many\r\nyears after his death, and which was even manifested before he died.\r\nAfterwards Professor Giard kindly wrote that by reference to the _procès\r\nverbaux_ of the Assembly, it had been found by Professor Hamy that he\r\nhad lived in the house of Buffon.\r\n\r\nThe house is situated at the corner of Rue de Buffon and Rue Geoffroy\r\nSt. Hilaire. The courtyard facing Rue Geoffroy St. Hilaire bears the\r\nnumber 2 Rue de Buffon, and is in the angle between the Galerie de\r\nZoologie and the Bibliothèque. The edifice is a large four-storied one.\r\nLamarck occupied the second _étage_, what we should call the third\r\nstory; it was first occupied by Buffon. His bedroom, where he died, was\r\non the _premier étage_. It was tenanted by De Quatrefages in his time,\r\nand is at present occupied by Professor G. T. Hamy; Professor L.\r\nVaillant living in the first _étage_, or second story, and Dr. J.\r\nDeniker, the _bibliothécaire_ and learned anthropologist, in the third.\r\nThe second _étage_ was, about fifty years ago (1840-50), renovated for\r\nthe use of Fremy the chemist, so that the exact room occupied by Lamarck\r\nas a study cannot be identified.\r\n\r\nThis ancient house was originally called _La Croix de Fer_, and was\r\nbuilt about two centuries before the foundation of the Jardin du Roi. It\r\nappears from an inspection of the notes on the titles and copies of the\r\noriginal deeds, preserved in the Archives, and kindly shown me by\r\nProfessor G. T. Hamy, the Archivist of the Museum, that this house was\r\nerected in 1468, the deed being dated _1xbre_, 1468. The house is\r\nreferred to as _maison ditte La Croix de Fer_ in deeds of 1684, 1755,\r\nand 1768. It was sold by Charles Roger to M. le Compte de Buffon,\r\nMarch 23, 1771. One of the old gardens overlooked by it was called _de\r\nJardin de la Croix_. It was originally the first structure erected on\r\nthe south side of the Jardin du Roi.\r\n\r\n[38] In the \"avertissement\" to his _Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres_\r\n(1801), after stating that he had at his disposition the magnificent\r\ncollection of invertebrate animals of the museum, he refers to his\r\nprivate collection as follows: \"Et une autre assez riche que j'ai formée\r\nmoi-même par près de trente années de recherches,\" p. vii. Afterwards he\r\nformed another collection of shells named according to his system, and\r\ncontaining a part of the types described in his _Histoire Naturelle des\r\nAnimaux sans Vertèbres_ and in his minor articles. This collection the\r\ngovernment did not acquire, and it is now in the museum at Geneva. The\r\nParis museum, however, possesses a good many of the Lamarckian types,\r\nwhich are on exhibition (Perrier, _l. c._, p. 20).\r\n\r\n[39] _Lettre du Ministre des Finances (de Ramel) au Ministre de\r\nl'Intérieur_ (13 pr. an V.). See Perrier, _l. c._, p. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLAST DAYS AND DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nLamarck's life was saddened and embittered by the loss of four wives,\r\nand the pangs of losing three of his children;[40] also by the rigid\r\neconomy he had to practise and the unending poverty of his whole\r\nexistence. A very heavy blow to him and to science was the loss, at an\r\nadvanced age, of his eyesight.\r\n\r\nIt was, apparently, not a sudden attack of blindness, for we have hints\r\nthat at times he had to call in Latreille and others to aid him in the\r\nstudy of the insects. The continuous use of the magnifying lens and the\r\nmicroscope, probably, was the cause of enfeebled eyesight, resulting in\r\ncomplete loss of vision. Duval[41] states that he passed the last ten\r\nyears of his life in darkness; that his loss of sight gradually came on\r\nuntil he became completely blind.\r\n\r\nIn the reports of the meetings of the Board of Professors there is but\r\none reference to his blindness. Previous to this we find that, at his\r\nlast appearance at these sessions--_i.e._, April 19, 1825--since his\r\ncondition did not permit him to give his course of lectures, he had\r\nasked M. Latreille to fill his place; but such was the latter's health,\r\nhe proposed that M. Audouin, sub-librarian of the French Institute,\r\nshould lecture in his stead, on the invertebrate animals. This was\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\nThe next reference, and the only explicit one, is that in the records\r\nfor May 23, 1826, as follows: \"Vu la cécité dont M. de Lamarck est\r\nfrappé, M. Bosc[42] continuera d'exercer sur les parties confiert à\r\nM. Audouin la surveillance attribuée au Professeur.\"\r\n\r\nBut, according to Duval, long before this he had been unable to use his\r\neyes. In his _Système analytique des Connaissances positives de\r\nl'Homme_, published in 1820, he refers to the sudden loss of his\r\neyesight.\r\n\r\nEven in advanced life Lamarck seems not to have suffered from\r\nill-health, despite the fact that he apparently during the last thirty\r\nyears of his life lived in a very secluded way. Whether he went out into\r\nthe world, to the theatre, or even went away from Paris and the Museum\r\ninto the country in his later years, is a matter of doubt. It is said\r\nthat he was fond of novels, his daughters reading to him those of the\r\nbest French authors. After looking with some care through the records of\r\nthe sessions of the Assembly of Professors, we are struck with the\r\nevidences of his devotion to routine museum work and to his courses of\r\nlectures.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Museum sent out to the _Écoles centrales_ of the\r\ndifferent departments of France named collections made up from the\r\nduplicates, and in this sort of drudgery Lamarck took an active part. He\r\nalso took a prominent share in the business of the Museum, in the\r\nexchange and in the purchase of specimens and collections in his\r\ndepartment, and even in the management of the menagerie. Thus he\r\nreported on the dentition of the young lions (one dying from teething),\r\non the illness and recovery of one of the elephants, on the generations\r\nof goats and kids in the park; also on a small-sized bull born of a\r\nsmall cow covered by a Scottish bull, the young animal having, as he\r\nstates, all the characters of the original.\r\n\r\nFor one year (1794) he was secretary of the Board of Professors of the\r\nMuseum.[43] The records of the meetings from 4 vendémiaire, l'an III.,\r\nuntil 4 vendémiaire, l'an IV., are each written in his bold, legible\r\nhandwriting or signed by him. He signed his name _Lamarck_, this period\r\nbeing that of the first republic. Afterwards, in the records, his name\r\nis written _De Lamarck_. He was succeeded by É. Geoffroy St. Hilaire,\r\nwho signed himself plain _Geoffroy_.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 he acted as treasurer of the Assembly, and again for a period of\r\nsix years, until and including 1811, when he resigned, the reason given\r\nbeing: \"Il s'occupe depuis six ans et que ses travaux et son age lui\r\nrendent penibles.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck was extremely regular in his attendance at these meetings. From\r\n1793 until 1818 he rarely, if ever, missed a meeting. We have only\r\nobserved in the records of this long period the absence of his name on\r\ntwo or three occasions from the list of those present. During 1818 and\r\nthe following year it was his blindness which probably prevented his\r\nregular attendance. July 15, 1818, he was present, and presented the\r\nfifth volume of his _Animaux sans Vertèbres_; and August 31, 1819, he\r\nwas present[44] and laid before the Assembly the sixth volume of the\r\nsame great work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF LAMARCK, WHEN OLD AND BLIND, IN THE COSTUME\r\nOF A MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE, ENGRAVED IN 1824.]\r\n\r\nFrom the observations of the records we infer that Lamarck never had\r\nany long, lingering illness or suffered from overwork, though his life\r\nhad little sunshine or playtime in it. He must have had a strong\r\nconstitution, his only infirmity being the terrible one (especially to\r\nan observer of nature) of total blindness.\r\n\r\nLamarck's greatest work in systematic zoölogy would never have been\r\ncompleted had it not been for the self-sacrificing spirit and devotion\r\nof his eldest daughter.\r\n\r\nA part of the sixth and the whole of the last volume of the _Animaux\r\nsans Vertèbres_ were presented to the Assembly of Professors\r\nSeptember 10, 1822. This volume was dictated to and written out by one\r\nof his daughters, Mlle. Cornelie De Lamarck. On her the aged savant\r\nleaned during the last ten years of his life--those years of failing\r\nstrength and of blindness finally becoming total. The frail woman\r\naccompanied him in his hours of exercise, and when he was confined to\r\nhis house she never left him. It is stated by Cuvier, in his eulogy,\r\nthat at her first walk out of doors after the end came she was nearly\r\novercome by the fresh air, to which she had become so unaccustomed. She,\r\nindeed, practically sacrificed her life to her father. It is one of the\r\nrarest and most striking instances of filial devotion known in the\r\nannals of science or literature, and is a noticeable contrast to the\r\ndaughters of the blind Milton, whose domestic life was rendered unhappy\r\nby their undutifulness, as they were impatient of the restraint and\r\nlabors his blindness had imposed upon them.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the seventh volume is a voluminous scientific work, filled\r\nwith very dry special details, making the labor of writing out from\r\ndictation, of corrections and preparation for the press, most wearisome\r\nand exhausting, to say nothing of the corrections of the proof-sheets, a\r\ntask which probably fell to her--work enough to break down the health of\r\na strong man.\r\n\r\nIt was a natural and becoming thing for the Assembly of Professors of\r\nthe Museum, in view of the \"malheureuse position de la famille,\" to vote\r\nto give her employment in the botanical laboratory in arranging and\r\npasting the dried plants, with a salary of 1,000 francs.\r\n\r\nOf the last illness of Lamarck, and the nature of the sickness to which\r\nhe finally succumbed, there is no account. It is probable that,\r\nenfeebled by the weakness of extreme old age, he gradually sank away\r\nwithout suffering from any acute disease.\r\n\r\nThe exact date of his death has been ascertained by Dr. Mondière,[45]\r\nwith the aid of M. Saint-Joanny, archiviste du Dèpartment de la Seine,\r\nwho made special search for the record. The \"acte\" states that\r\nDecember 28, 1829, Lamarck, then a widower, died in the Jardin du Roi,\r\nat the age of eighty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe obsequies, as stated in the _Moniteur Universel_ of Paris for\r\nDecember 23, 1829, were celebrated on the Sunday previous in the Church\r\nof Saint-Médard, his parish. From the church the remains were borne to\r\nthe cemetery of Montparnasse. At the interment, which took place\r\nDecember 30, M. Latreille, in the name of the Academy of Sciences, and\r\nM. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, in the name and on behalf of his colleagues,\r\nthe Professors of the Museum of Natural History, pronounced eulogies at\r\nthe grave. The eulogy prepared by Cuvier, and published after his death,\r\nwas read at a session of the Academy of Sciences, by Baron Silvestre,\r\nNovember 26, 1832.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these formalities, the great French naturalist,\r\n\"the Linné of France,\" was buried as one forgotten and unknown. We read\r\nwith astonishment, in the account by Dr. A. Mondière, who made zealous\r\ninquiries for the exact site of the grave of Lamarck, that it is and\r\nforever will be unknown. It is a sad and discreditable, and to us\r\ninexplicable, fact that his remains did not receive decent burial. They\r\nwere not even deposited in a separate grave, but were thrown into a\r\ntrench apparently situated apart from the other graves, and from which\r\nthe bones of those thrown there were removed every five years. They are\r\nprobably now in the catacombs of Paris, mingled with those of the\r\nthousands of unknown or paupers in that great ossuary.[46]\r\n\r\nDr. Mondière's account is as follows. Having found in the _Moniteur_ the\r\nnotice of the burial services, as above stated, he goes on to say:\r\n\r\n  \"Armed with this document, I went again to the cemetery of\r\n  Montparnasse, where I fortunately found a conservator, M. Lacave,\r\n  who is entirely _au courant_ with the question of transformism. He\r\n  therefore interested himself in my inquiries, and, thanks to him, I\r\n  have been able to determine exactly where Lamarck had been buried. I\r\n  say had been, because, alas! he had been simply placed in a _trench\r\n  off on one side_ (_fosse à part_), that is to say, one which should\r\n  change its occupant at the end of five years. Was it negligence, was\r\n  it the jealousy of his colleagues, was it the result of the troubles\r\n  of 1830? In brief, there had been no permission granted to purchase\r\n  a burial lot. The bones of Lamarck are probably at this moment mixed\r\n  with those of all the other unknown which lie there. What had at\r\n  first led us into an error is that we made the inquiries under the\r\n  name of Lamarck instead of that of de Monnet. In reality, the\r\n  register of inscription bears the following mention:\r\n\r\n  \"'De Monnet de Lamarck buried this 20 December 1829 (85 years), 3d\r\n  square, 1st division, 2d line, trench 22.'\r\n\r\n  \"At some period later, a friendly hand, without doubt, had written\r\n  on the margin of the register the following information:\r\n\r\n  \"'To the left of M. Dassas.'\r\n\r\n  \"M. Lacave kindly went with us to search for the place where Lamarck\r\n  had been interred, and on the register we saw this:\r\n\r\n  \"'Dassas, 1st division, 4th line south, No. 6 to the west,\r\n  concession 1165-1829.' On arriving at the spot designated, we found\r\n  some new graves, but nothing to indicate that of M. Dassas, our only\r\n  mark by which we could trace the site after the changes wrought\r\n  since 1829. After several ineffectual attempts, I finally perceived\r\n  a flat grave, surrounded by an iron railing, and covered with weeds.\r\n  Its surface seemed to me very regular, and I probed this lot. There\r\n  was a gravestone there. The grave-digger who accompanied us cleared\r\n  away the surface, and I confess that it was with the greatest\r\n  pleasure and with deep emotion that we read the name Dassas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POSITION OF THE BURIAL PLACE OF LAMARCK IN THE CEMETERY\r\nOF MONTPARNASSE.]\r\n\r\n  \"We found the place, but unfortunately, as I have previously said,\r\n  the remains of Lamarck are no longer there.\"\r\n\r\nMondière added to his letter a little plan (p. 59), which he drew on the\r\nspot.[47]\r\n\r\nBut the life-work of Lamarck and his theory of organic evolution, as\r\nwell as the lessons of his simple and noble character, are more durable\r\nand lasting than any monument of stone or brass. His name will never be\r\nforgotten either by his own countrymen or by the world of science and\r\nphilosophy. After the lapse of nearly a hundred years, and in this first\r\nyear of the twentieth century, his views have taken root and flourished\r\nwith a surprising strength and vigor, and his name is preëminent among\r\nthe naturalists of his time.\r\n\r\nNo monument exists in Montparnasse, but within the last decade, though\r\nthe reparation has come tardily, the bust of Lamarck may be seen by\r\nvisitors to the Jardin des Plantes, on the outer wall of the Nouvelle\r\nGalerie, containing the Museums of Comparative Anatomy, Palæontology,\r\nand Anthropology.\r\n\r\nAlthough the city of Paris has not yet erected a monument to its\r\ngreatest naturalist, some public recognition of his eminent services to\r\nthe city and nation was manifested when the Municipal Council of Paris,\r\non February 10, 1875, gave the name Lamarck to a street.[48] This is a\r\nlong and not unimportant street on the hill of Montmartre in the XVIII^e\r\n_arrondissement_, and in the zone of the old stone or gypsum quarries\r\nwhich existed before Paris extended so far out in that direction, and\r\nfrom which were taken the fossil remains of the early tertiary mammals\r\ndescribed by Cuvier.\r\n\r\nThe city of Toulouse has also honored itself by naming one of its\r\nstreets after Lamarck; this was due to the proposal of Professor Émile\r\nCartailhac to the Municipal Council, which voted to this effect May 12,\r\n1886.\r\n\r\nIn the meetings of the Assembly of Professors no one took the trouble to\r\nprepare and enter minutes, however brief and formal, relative to his\r\ndecease. The death of Lamarck is not even referred to in the\r\n_Procès-verbaux_. This is the more marked because there is an entry in\r\nthe same records for 1829, and about the same date, of an extraordinary\r\n_séance_ held November 19, 1829, when \"the Assembly\" was convoked to\r\ntake measures regarding the death of Professor Vauquelin relative to the\r\nchoice of a candidate, Chevreul being elected to fill his chair.\r\n\r\nLamarck's chair was at his death divided, and the two professorships\r\nthus formed were given to Latreille and De Blainville.\r\n\r\nAt the session of the Assembly of Professors held December 8, 1829,\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire sent in a letter to the Assembly urging that the\r\ndepartment of invertebrate animals be divided into two, and referred to\r\nthe bad state of preservation of the insects, the force of assistants to\r\ncare for these being insufficient. He also, in his usual tactful way,\r\nreferred to the \"_complaisance extrème de la parte de M. De Lamarck_\" in\r\n1793, in assenting to the reunion in a single professorship of the mass\r\nof animals then called \"_insectes et vermes_.\"\r\n\r\nThe two successors of the chair held by Lamarck were certainly not\r\ndilatory in asking for appointments. At a session of the Professors held\r\nDecember 22, 1829, the first meeting after his death, we find the\r\nfollowing entry: \"M. Latreille écrit pour exprimer son désir d'être\r\nprésenté comme candidat à la chaire vacante par le décès de M. Lamarck\r\net pour rappeler ses titres à cette place.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Blainville also wrote in the same manner: \"Dans le cas que la\r\nchaire serait divisée, il demande la place de Professeur de l'histoire\r\ndes animaux inarticulés. Dans le cas contraire il se présente également\r\ncomme candidat, voulant, tout en respectant les droits acquis, ne pas\r\nlaisser dans l'oubli ceux qui lui appartiennent.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 12, 1830, Latreille[49] was unanimously elected by the Assembly\r\na candidate to the chair of entomology, and at a following session\r\n(February 16th) De Blainville was unanimously elected a candidate for\r\nthe chair of _Molluscs, Vers et Zoophytes_, and on the 16th of March the\r\nroyal ordinance confirming those elections was received by the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThere could have been no fitter appointments made for those two\r\npositions. Lamarck had long known Latreille \"and loved him as a son.\" De\r\nBlainville honored and respected Lamarck, and fully appreciated his\r\ncommanding abilities as an observer and thinker.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] I have been unable to ascertain the names of any of his wives, or\r\nof his children, except his daughter, Cornelie.\r\n\r\n[41] \"L'examen minutieux de petits animaux, analysés à l'aide\r\nd'instruments grossissants, fatigua, puis affaiblait, sa vue.

Nat. des Vers_ (1802); _Hist. Nat. des\r\nCrustacés_ (1828), and papers on insects and plants. He was associated\r\nwith Lamarck in the publication of the _Journal d'Histoire Naturelle_.\r\nDuring the Reign of Terror in 1793 he was a friend of Madame Roland, was\r\narrested, but afterwards set free and placed first on the Directory in\r\n1795. In 1798 he sailed for Charleston, S. C. Nominated successively\r\nvice-consul at Wilmington and consul at New York, but not obtaining his\r\nexequatur from President Adams, he went to live with the botanist\r\nMichaux in Carolina in his botanical garden, where he devoted himself to\r\nnatural history until the quarrel in 1800 between the United States and\r\nFrance caused him to return to France. On his return he sent North\r\nAmerican insects to his friends Fabricius and Olivier, fishes to\r\nLacépède, birds to Daudin, reptiles to Latreille. Not giving all his\r\ntime to public life, he devoted himself to natural history,\r\nhorticulture, and agriculture, succeeding Thouin in the chair of\r\nhorticulture, where he was most usefully employed until his\r\ndeath.--(Cuvier's _Éloge_.)\r\n\r\n[43] The first director of the Board or Assembly of\r\nProfessors-administrative of the Museum was Daubenton, Lacépède being\r\nthe secretary, Thouin the treasurer. Daubenton was succeeded by Jussieu;\r\nand Lacépède, first by Desfontaines and afterwards by Lamarck, who was\r\nelected secretary 18 fructidor, an II. (1794).\r\n\r\n[44] His attendance this year was infrequent. July 10, 1820, he was\r\npresent and made a report relative to madrepores and molluscs. In the\r\nsummer of 1821 he attended several of the meetings. August 7, 1821, he\r\nwas present, and referred to the collection of shells of Struthiolaria.\r\nHe was present May 23d and June 9th, when it was voted that he should\r\nenjoy the garden of the house he occupied and that a chamber should be\r\nadded to his lodgings. He was frequent in attendance this year,\r\nespecially during the summer months. He attended a few meetings at\r\nintervals in 1822, 1823, and only twice in 1824.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting held April 19, 1825, he was present, and, stating that his\r\ncondition did not permit him to lecture, asked to have Audouin take his\r\nplace, as Latreille's health did not allow him to take up the work. The\r\nnext week (26th) he was likewise present. On May 10 he was present, as\r\nalso on June 28, October 11, and also through December, 1825. His last\r\nappearance at these business meetings was on July 11, 1828.\r\n\r\n[45] See, for the _Acte de décès_, _L'Homme_, iv. p. 289, and _Lamarck.\r\nPar un Groupe de Transformistes_, etc., p. 24.\r\n\r\n[46] Dr. Mondière in _L'Homme_, iv. p. 291, and _Lamarck. Par un Groupe\r\nde Transformistes_, p. 271. A somewhat parallel case is that of Mozart,\r\nwho was buried at Vienna in the common ground of St. Marx, the exact\r\nposition of his grave being unknown. There were no ceremonies at his\r\ngrave, and even his friends followed him no farther than the city gates,\r\nowing to a violent storm.--(_The Century Cyclopedia of Names._)\r\n\r\n[47] Still hoping that the site of the grave might have been kept open,\r\nand desiring to satisfy myself as to whether there was possibly space\r\nenough left on which to erect a modest monument to the memory of\r\nLamarck, I took with me the _brochure_ containing the letter and plan of\r\nDr. Mondière to the cemetery of Montparnasse. With the aid of one of the\r\nofficials I found what he told me was the site, but the entire place was\r\ndensely covered with the tombs and grave-stones of later interments,\r\nrendering the erection of a stone, however small and simple, quite out\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\n[48] The Rue Lamarck begins at the elevated square on which is situated\r\nthe Church of the Sacré-Coeur, now in process of erection, and from this\r\npoint one obtains a commanding and very fine view overlooking the city;\r\nfrom there the street curves round to the westward, ending in the Avenue\r\nde Saint-Ouen, and continues as a wide and long thoroughfare, ending to\r\nthe north of the cemetery of Montmartre. A neighboring street, Rue\r\nBecquerel, is named after another French savant, and parallel to it is a\r\nshort street named Rue Darwin.\r\n\r\n[49] Latreille was born at Brives, November 29, 1762, and died\r\nFebruary 6, 1833. He was the leading entomologist of his time, and to\r\nhim Cuvier was indebted for the arrangement of the insects in the _Règne\r\nAnimal_. His bust is to be seen on the same side of the Nouvelle Galerie\r\nin the Jardin des Plantes as those of Lamarck, Cuvier, De Blainville,\r\nand D'Orbigny. His first paper was introduced by Lamarck in 1792. In the\r\nminutes of the session of 4 thermidor, l'an VI. (July, 1798), we find\r\nthis entry: \"The citizen Lamarck announces that the citizen Latreille\r\noffered to the administration to work under the direction of that\r\nprofessor in arranging the very numerous collection of insects of the\r\nMuseum, so as to place them under the eye of the public.\" And here he\r\nremained until his appointment. Several years (1825) before Lamarck's\r\ndeath he had asked to have Latreille fill his place in giving\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nAudouin (1797-1841), also an eminent entomologist and morphologist, was\r\nappointed _aide-naturaliste-adjoint_ in charge of Mollusca, Crustacea,\r\nWorms, and Zoöphytes. He was afterwards associated with H. Milne Edwards\r\nin works on annelid worms. December 26, 1827, Latreille asked to be\r\nallowed to employ Boisduval as a _préparateur_; he became the author of\r\nseveral works on injurious insects and Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPOSITION IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE; OPINIONS OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES AND\r\nSOME LATER BIOLOGISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Blainville, a worthy successor of Lamarck, in his posthumous book,\r\n_Cuvier et Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire_, pays the highest tribute to his\r\npredecessor, whose position as the leading naturalist of his time he\r\nfully and gratefully acknowledges, saying: \"Among the men whose lectures\r\nI have had the advantage of hearing, I truly recognize only three\r\nmasters, M. de Lamarck, M. Claude Richard, and M. Pinel\" (p. 43). He\r\nalso speaks of wishing to write the scientific biographies of Cuvier and\r\nDe Lamarck, the two zoölogists of this epoch whose lectures he most\r\nfrequently attended and whose writings he studied, and \"who have\r\nexercised the greatest influence on the zoölogy of our time\" (p. 42).\r\nLikewise in the opening words of the preface he refers to the rank taken\r\nby Lamarck:\r\n\r\n  \"The aim which I have proposed to myself in my course on the\r\n  principles of zoölogy demonstrated by the history of its progress\r\n  from Aristotle to our time, and consequently the plan which I have\r\n  followed to attain this aim, have very naturally led me, so to\r\n  speak, in spite of myself, to signalize in M. de Lamarck the\r\n  expression of one of those phases through which the science of\r\n  organization has to pass in order to arrive at its last term before\r\n  showing its true aim. From my point of view this phase does not seem\r\n  to me to have been represented by any other naturalist of our time,\r\n  whatever may have been the reputation which he made during his\r\n  life.\"\r\n\r\nHe then refers to the estimation in which Lamarck was held by Auguste\r\nComte, who, in his _Cours de Philosophie Positive_, has anticipated and\r\neven surpassed himself in the high esteem he felt for \"the celebrated\r\nauthor of the _Philosophie Zoologique_.\"\r\n\r\nThe eulogy by Cuvier, which gives most fully the details of the early\r\nlife of Lamarck, and which has been the basis for all the subsequent\r\nbiographical sketches, was unworthy of him. Lamarck had, with his\r\ncustomary self-abnegation and generosity, aided and favored the young\r\nCuvier in the beginning of his career,[50] who in his _Règne Animal_\r\nadopted the classes founded by Lamarck. Thoroughly convinced of the\r\nerroneous views of Cuvier in regard to cataclysms, he criticised and\r\nopposed them in his writings in a courteous and proper way without\r\ndirectly mentioning Cuvier by name or entering into any public debate\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour came for the great comparative anatomist and\r\npalæontologist, from his exalted position, to prepare a tribute to the\r\nmemory of a naturalist of equal merit and of a far more thoughtful and\r\nprofound spirit, to be read before the French Academy of Sciences, what\r\na eulogy it was--as De Blainville exclaims, _et quel éloge_! It was not\r\nprinted until after Cuvier's death, and then, it is stated, portions\r\nwere omitted as not suitable for publication.[51] This is, we believe,\r\nthe only stain on Cuvier's life, and it was unworthy of the great man.\r\nIn this _éloge_, so different in tone from the many others which are\r\ncollected in the three volumes of Cuvier's eulogies, he indiscriminately\r\nridicules all of Lamarck's theories. Whatever may have been his\r\ncondemnation of Lamarck's essays on physical and chemical subjects, he\r\nmight have been more reserved and less dogmatic and sarcastic in his\r\nestimate of what he supposed to be the value of Lamarck's views on\r\nevolution. It was Cuvier's adverse criticisms and ridicule and his\r\nanti-evolutional views which, more than any other single cause, retarded\r\nthe progress of biological science and the adoption of a working theory\r\nof evolution for which the world had to wait half a century.\r\n\r\nIt even appears that Lamarck was in part instrumental in inducing Cuvier\r\nin 1795 to go to Paris from Normandy, and become connected with the\r\nMuseum. De Blainville relates that the Abbé Tessier met the young\r\nzoölogist at Valmont near Fécamp, and wrote to Geoffroy that \"he had\r\njust discovered in Normandy a pearl,\" and invited him to do what he\r\ncould to induce Cuvier to come to Paris. \"I made,\" said Geoffroy, \"the\r\nproposition to my _confrères_, but I was supported, and only feebly, by\r\nM. de Lamarck, who slightly knew M. Cuvier as the author of a memoir on\r\nentomology.\"\r\n\r\nThe eulogy pronounced by Geoffroy St. Hilaire over the remains of his\r\nold friend and colleague was generous, sympathetic, and heartfelt.\r\n\r\n  \"Yes [he said, in his eloquent way], for us who knew M. de Lamarck,\r\n  whom his counsels have guided, whom we have found always\r\n  indefatigable, devoted, occupied so willingly with the most\r\n  difficult labors, we shall not fear to say that such a loss leaves\r\n  in our ranks an immense void. From the blessings of such a life, so\r\n  rich in instructive lessons, so remarkable for the most generous\r\n  self-abnegation, it is difficult to choose.\r\n\r\n  \"A man of vigorous, profound ideas, and very often admirably\r\n  generalized, Lamarck conceived them with a view to the public good.\r\n  If he met, as often happened, with great opposition, he spoke of it\r\n  as a condition imposed on every one who begins a reform. Moreover,\r\n  the great age, the infirmities, but especially the grievous\r\n  blindness of M. de Lamarck had reserved for him another lot. This\r\n  great and strong mind could enjoy some consolation in knowing the\r\n  judgment of posterity, which for him began in his own lifetime. When\r\n  his last tedious days, useless to science, had arrived, when he had\r\n  ceased to be subjected to rivalry, envy and passion became\r\n  extinguished and justice alone remained. De Lamarck then heard\r\n  impartial voices, the anticipated echo of posterity, which would\r\n  judge him as history will judge him. Yes, the scientific world has\r\n  pronounced its judgment in giving him the name of 'the French\r\n  Linné,' thus linking together the two men who have both merited a\r\n  triple crown by their works on general natural history, zoölogy and\r\n  botany, and whose names, increasing in fame from age to age, will\r\n  both be handed down to the remotest posterity.\"[52]\r\n\r\nAlso in his _Études sur la Vie, les Ouvrages, et les Doctrines de\r\nBuffon_ (1838), Geoffroy again, with much warmth of affection, says:\r\n\r\n  \"Attacked on all sides, injured likewise by odious ridicule,\r\n  Lamarck, too indignant to answer these cutting epigrams, submitted\r\n  to the indignity with a sorrowful patience.... Lamarck lived a long\r\n  while poor, blind, and forsaken, but not by me; I shall ever love\r\n  and venerate him.\"[53]\r\n\r\nThe following evidently heartfelt and sincere tribute to his memory,\r\nshowing warm esteem and thorough respect for Lamarck, and also a\r\nconfident feeling that his lasting fame was secure, is to be found in an\r\nobscure little book[54] containing satirical, humorous, but perhaps not\r\nalways fair or just, characterizations and squibs concerning the\r\nprofessors and aid-naturalists of the Jardin des Plantes.\r\n\r\n  \"What head will not be uncovered on hearing pronounced the name of\r\n  the man whose genius was ignored and who languished steeped in\r\n  bitterness. Blind, poor, forgotten, he remained alone with a glory\r\n  of whose extent he himself was conscious, but which only the coming\r\n  ages will sanction, when shall be revealed more clearly the laws of\r\n  organization.\r\n\r\n  \"Lamarck, thy abandonment, sad as it was in thy old age, is better\r\n  than the ephemeral glory of men who only maintain their reputation\r\n  by sharing in the errors of their time.\r\n\r\n  \"Honor to thee! Respect to thy memory! Thou hast died in the breach\r\n  while fighting for truth, and the truth assures thee immortality.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck's theoretical views were not known in Germany until many years\r\nafter his death. Had Goethe, his contemporary (1749-1832), known of\r\nthem, he would undoubtedly have welcomed his speculations, have\r\nexpressed his appreciation of them, and Lamarck's reputation would, in\r\nhis own lifetime, have raised him from the obscurity of his later years\r\nat Paris.\r\n\r\nHearty appreciation, though late in the century, came from Ernst\r\nHaeckel, whose bold and suggestive works have been so widely read. In\r\nhis _History of Creation_ (1868) he thus estimates Lamarck's work as a\r\nphilosopher:\r\n\r\n  \"To him will always belong the immortal glory of having for the\r\n  first time worked out the theory of descent, as an independent\r\n  scientific theory of the first order, and as the philosophical\r\n  foundation of the whole science of biology.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the _Philosophie Zoologique_, he says:\r\n\r\n  \"This admirable work is the first connected exposition of the theory\r\n  of descent carried out strictly into all its consequences. By its\r\n  purely mechanical method of viewing organic nature, and the strictly\r\n  philosophical proofs brought forward in it, Lamarck's work is raised\r\n  far above the prevailing dualistic views of his time; and with the\r\n  exception of Darwin's work, which appeared just half a century\r\n  later, we know of none which we could, in this respect, place by the\r\n  side of the _Philosophie Zoologique_. How far it was in advance of\r\n  its time is perhaps best seen from the circumstance that it was not\r\n  understood by most men, and for fifty years was not spoken of at\r\n  all. Cuvier, Lamarck's greatest opponent, in his _Report on the\r\n  Progress of Natural Science_, in which the most unimportant\r\n  anatomical investigations are enumerated, does not devote a single\r\n  word to this work, which forms an epoch in science. Goethe, also,\r\n  who took such a lively interest in the French nature-philosophy and\r\n  in the 'thoughts of kindred minds beyond the Rhine,' nowhere\r\n  mentions Lamarck, and does not seem to have known the _Philosophie\r\n  Zoologique_ at all.\"\r\n\r\nAgain in 1882 Haeckel writes:[55]\r\n\r\n  \"We regard it as a truly tragic fact that the _Philosophie\r\n  Zoologique_ of Lamarck, one of the greatest productions of the great\r\n  literary period of the beginning of our century, received at first\r\n  only the slightest notice, and within a few years became wholly\r\n  forgotten.... Not until fully fifty years later, when Darwin\r\n  breathed new life into the transformation views founded therein, was\r\n  the buried treasure again recovered, and we cannot refrain from\r\n  regarding it as the most complete presentation of the development\r\n  theory before Darwin.\r\n\r\n  \"While Lamarck clearly expressed all the essential fundamental ideas\r\n  of our present doctrine of descent; and excites our admiration at\r\n  the depth of his morphological knowledge, he none the less surprises\r\n  us by the prophetic (_vorausschauende_) clearness of his\r\n  physiological conceptions.\"\r\n\r\nIn his views on life, the nature of the will and reason, and other\r\nsubjects, Haeckel declares that Lamarck was far above most of his\r\ncontemporaries, and that he sketched out a programme of the biology of\r\nthe future which was not carried out until our day.\r\n\r\nJ. Victor Carus[56] also claims for Lamarck \"the lasting merit of having\r\nbeen the first to have placed the theory (of descent) on a scientific\r\nfoundation.\"\r\n\r\nThe best, most catholic, and just exposition of Lamarck's views, and\r\nwhich is still worth reading, is that by Lyell Chapters XXXIV.-XXXVI. of\r\nhis _Principles of Geology_, 1830, and though at that time one would not\r\nlook for an acceptance of views which then seemed extraordinary and,\r\nindeed, far-fetched, Lyell had no words of satire and ridicule, only a\r\ncalm, able statement and discussion of his principles. Indeed, it is\r\nwell known that when, in after years, his friend Charles Darwin\r\npublished his views, Lyell expressed some leaning towards the older\r\nspeculations of Lamarck.\r\n\r\nLyell's opinions as to the interest and value of Lamarck's ideas may be\r\nfound in his _Life and Letters_, and also in the _Life and Letters of\r\nCharles Darwin_. In the chapter, _On the Reception of the Origin of\r\nSpecies_, by Huxley, are the following extracts from Lyell's _Letters_\r\n(ii., pp. 179-204). In a letter addressed to Mantell (dated March 2,\r\n1827), Lyell speaks of having just read Lamarck; he expresses his\r\ndelight at Lamarck's theories, and his personal freedom from any\r\nobjections based on theological grounds. And though he is evidently\r\nalarmed at the pithecoid origin of man involved in Lamarck's doctrine,\r\nhe observes: \"But, after all, what changes species may really undergo!\r\nHow impossible will it be to distinguish and lay down a line beyond\r\nwhich some of the so-called extinct species have never passed into\r\nrecent ones?\"\r\n\r\nHe also quotes a remarkable passage in the postscript to a letter\r\nwritten to Sir John Herschel in 1836: \"In regard to the origination of\r\nnew species, I am very glad to find that you think it probable it may be\r\ncarried on through the intervention of intermediate causes.\"\r\n\r\nHow nearly Lyell was made a convert to evolution by reading Lamarck's\r\nworks may be seen by the following extracts from his letters, quoted by\r\nHuxley:\r\n\r\n  \"I think the old 'creation' is almost as much required as ever, but\r\n  of course it takes a new form if Lamarck's views, improved by yours,\r\n  are adopted.\" (To Darwin, March 11, 1863, p. 363.)\r\n\r\n       ~       ~       ~       ~       ~\r\n\r\n  \"As to Lamarck, I find that Grove, who has been reading him, is\r\n  wonderfully struck with his book. I remember that it was the\r\n  conclusion he (Lamarck) came to about man, that fortified me thirty\r\n  years ago against the great impression which his argument at first\r\n  made on my mind--all the greater because Constant Prevost, a pupil\r\n  of Cuvier forty years ago, told me his conviction 'that Cuvier\r\n  thought species not real, but that science could not advance without\r\n  assuming that they were so.'\"\r\n\r\n       ~       ~       ~       ~       ~\r\n\r\n  \"When I came to the conclusion that after all Lamarck was going to\r\n  be shown to be right, that we must 'go the whole orang,' I re-read\r\n  his book, and remembering when it was written, I felt I had done\r\n  him injustice.\r\n\r\n  \"Even as to man's gradual acquisition of more and more ideas, and\r\n  then of speech slowly as the ideas multiplied, and then his\r\n  persecution of the beings most nearly allied and competing with\r\n  him--all this is very Darwinian.\r\n\r\n  \"The substitution of the variety-making power for 'volition,'\r\n  'muscular action,' etc. (and in plants even volition was not called\r\n  in), is in some respects only a change of names. Call a new variety\r\n  a new creation, one may say of the former, as of the latter, what\r\n  you say when you observe that the creationist explains nothing, and\r\n  only affirms 'it is so because it is so.'\r\n\r\n  \"Lamarck's belief in the slow changes in the organic and inorganic\r\n  world in the year 1800 was surely above the standard of his times,\r\n  and he was right about progression in the main, though you have\r\n  vastly advanced that doctrine. As to Owen in his 'Aye Aye' paper, he\r\n  seems to me a disciple of Pouchet, who converted him at Rouen to\r\n  'spontaneous generation.'\r\n\r\n  \"Have I not, at p. 412, put the vast distinction between you and\r\n  Lamarck as to 'necessary progression' strongly enough?\" (To Darwin,\r\n  March 15, 1863. _Lyell's Letters_, ii., p. 365.)\r\n\r\nDarwin, in the freedom of private correspondence, paid scant respect to\r\nthe views of his renowned predecessor, as the following extracts from\r\nhis published letters will show:\r\n\r\n  \"Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a 'tendency to\r\n  progression,' 'adaptations from the slow willing of animals,' etc.\r\n  But the conclusions I am led to are not widely different from his;\r\n  though the means of change are wholly so.\" (Darwin's _Life and\r\n  Letters_, ii., p. 23, 1844.)\r\n\r\n       ~       ~       ~       ~       ~\r\n\r\n  \"With respect to books on this subject, I do not know of any\r\n  systematical ones, except Lamarck's, which is veritable rubbish....\r\n  Is it not strange that the author of such a book as the _Animaux\r\n  sans Vertèbres_ should have written that insects, which never see\r\n  their eggs, should _will_ (and plants, their seeds) to be of\r\n  particular forms, so as to become attached to particular\r\n  objects.\"[57] (ii., p. 29, 1844.)\r\n\r\n       ~       ~       ~       ~       ~\r\n\r\n  \"Lamarck is the only exception, that I can think of, of an accurate\r\n  describer of species, at least in the Invertebrate Kingdom, who has\r\n  disbelieved in permanent species, but he in his absurd though clever\r\n  work has done the subject harm.\" (ii., p. 39, no date.)\r\n\r\n       ~       ~       ~       ~       ~\r\n\r\n  \"To talk of climate or Lamarckian habit producing such adaptions to\r\n  other organic beings is futile.\" (ii., p. 121, 1858.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another great English thinker and naturalist of rare\r\nbreadth and catholicity, and despite the fact that he rejected Lamarck's\r\npeculiar evolutional views, associated him with the most eminent\r\nbiologists.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Romanes, dated in 1882, Huxley thus estimates Lamarck's\r\nposition in the scientific world:\r\n\r\n  \"I am not likely to take a low view of Darwin's position in the\r\n  history of science, but I am disposed to think that Buffon and\r\n  Lamarck would run him hard in both genius and fertility. In breadth\r\n  of view and in extent of knowledge these two men were giants, though\r\n  we are apt to forget their services. Von Bär was another man of the\r\n  same stamp; Cuvier, in a somewhat lower rank, another; and J. Müller\r\n  another.\" (_Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley_, ii., p. 42,\r\n  1900.)\r\n\r\nThe memory of Lamarck is deeply and warmly cherished throughout France.\r\nHe gave his country a second Linné. One of the leading botanists in\r\nEurope, and the greatest zoölogist of his time, he now shares equally\r\nwith Geoffroy St. Hilaire and with Cuvier the distinction of raising\r\nbiological science to that eminence in the first third of the nineteenth\r\ncentury which placed France, as the mother of biologists, in the van of\r\nall the nations. When we add to his triumphs in pure zoölogy the fact\r\nthat he was in his time the philosopher of biology, it is not going too\r\nfar to crown him as one of the intellectual glories, not only of France,\r\nbut of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nHow warmly his memory is now cherished may be appreciated by the perusal\r\nof the following letter, with its delightful reminiscences, for which we\r\nare indebted to the venerable and distinguished zoölogist and\r\ncomparative anatomist who formerly occupied the chair made illustrious\r\nby Lamarck, and by his successor, De Blainville, and who founded the\r\nLaboratoire Arago on the Mediterranean, also that of Experimental\r\nZoölogy at Roscoff, and who still conducts the _Journal de Zoologie\r\nExpérimentale_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARIS LE 28 _Décembre_, 1899.\r\n\r\n  M. le PROFESSEUR PACKARD.\r\n\r\n  _Cher Monsieur_: Vous m'avez fait l'honneur de me demander des\r\n  renseignements sur la famille de De Lamarck, et sur ses relations,\r\n  afin de vous en servir dans la biographie que vous préparez de\r\n  notre grand naturaliste.\r\n\r\n  Je n'ai rien appris de plus que ce que vous voulez bien me rappeler\r\n  comme l'ayant trouvé dans mon adresse de 1889. Je ne connais plus ni\r\n  les noms ni les adresses des parents de De Lamarck, et c'est avec\r\n  regret qu'il ne m'est pas possible de répondre à vos désirs.\r\n\r\n  Lorsque je commençai mes études à Paris, on ne s'occupait guère des\r\n  idées générales de De Lamarck que pour s'en moquer. Excepté Geoffroy\r\n  St. Hilaire et De Blainville, dont j'ai pu suivre les belles leçons\r\n  et qui le citaient souvent, on parlait peu de la philosophie\r\n  zoologique.\r\n\r\n  Il m'a été possible de causer avec des anciens collègues du grand\r\n  naturaliste; au Jardin des Plantes de très grands savants, dont je\r\n  ne veux pas écrire le nom, le traitaient _de fou_!\r\n\r\n  Il avait loué un appartement sur le haut d'une maison, et là\r\n  cherchait d'après la direction des nuages à prévoir l'état du temps.\r\n\r\n  On riait de ces études. N'est-ce pas comme un observatoire de\r\n  météorologie que ce savant zoologiste avait pour ainsi dire fondé\r\n  avant que la science ne se fut emparée de l'idée?\r\n\r\n  Lorsque j'eus l'honneur d'être nommé professeur au Jardin des\r\n  Plantes en 1865, je fis l'historique de la chaire que j'occupais, et\r\n  qui avait été illustrée par De Lamarck et De Blainville. Je crois\r\n  que je suis le premier à avoir fait l'histoire de notre grand\r\n  naturaliste dans un cours public. Je dus travailler pas mal pour\r\n  arriver à bien saisir l'idée fondamentale de la philosophie. Les\r\n  définitions de la nature et des forces qui président aux changements\r\n  qui modifient les êtres d'après les conditions auxquelles ils sont\r\n  soumis ne sont pas toujours faciles à rendre claires pour un public\r\n  souvent difficile.\r\n\r\n  Ce qui frappe surtout dans ses raisonnements, c'est que De Lamarck\r\n  est parfaitement logique. Il comprend très bien ce que plus d'un\r\n  transformiste de nos jours ne cherche pas à éclairer, que le premier\r\n  pas, le pas difficile à faire pour arriver à expliquer la création\r\n  par des modifications successives, c'est le passage de la matière\r\n  inorganique à la matière organisée, et il imagine la chaleur et\r\n  l'électricité comme étant les deux facteurs qui par attraction ou\r\n  répulsion finissent par former ces petits amas organisés qui seront\r\n  le point de départ de toutes les transformations de tous les\r\n  organismes.\r\n\r\n  Voilà le point de départ--la génération spontanée se trouve ainsi\r\n  expliquée!\r\n\r\n  De Lamarck était un grand et profond observateur. On me disait au\r\n  Museum (des contemporains) qu'il avait l'Instinct de l'Espèce. Il y\r\n  aurait beaucoup à dire sur cette expression--l'instinct de\r\n  l'espèce--il m'est difficile dans une simple lettre de développer\r\n  des idées philosophiques que j'ai sur cette question,--laquelle\r\n  suppose la notion de l'individu parfaitement définie et acquis.\r\n\r\n  Je ne vous citerai qu'un exemple. Je ne l'ai vu signalé nulle part\r\n  dans les ouvrages anciens sur De Lamarck.\r\n\r\n  Qu'étaient nos connaissances à l'époque de De Lamarck sur les\r\n  Polypiers? Les Hydraires étaient loin d'avoir fourni les\r\n  remarquables observations qui parurent dans le milieu à peu près du\r\n  siècle qui vient de finir, et cependant De Lamarck déplace hardiment\r\n  la Lucernaire--l'éloigne des Coralliaires, et la rapproche des êtres\r\n  qui forment le grand groupe des Hydraires. Ce trait me paraît\r\n  remarquable et le rapporte à cette réputation qu'il avait au Museum\r\n  de jouir de l'instinct de l'espèce.\r\n\r\n  De toute part on acclame le grand naturaliste, et'il n'y a pas même\r\n  une rue portant son nom aux environs du Jardin des Plantes? J'ai eu\r\n  beau réclamer le conseil municipal de Paris à d'autres favoris que\r\n  De Lamarck.\r\n\r\n  Lorsque le Jardin des Plantes fut réorganisé par la Convention, De\r\n  Lamarck avait 50 ans. Il ne s'était jusqu'alors occupé que de\r\n  botanique. Il fut à cet age chargé de l'histoire de la partie du\r\n  règne animal renfermant les animaux invertèbres sauf les Insectes et\r\n  les Crustacés. La chaire est restée la même; elle comprend les vers,\r\n  les helminthes, les mollusques, et ce qu'on appelait autrefois les\r\n  Zoophytes ou Rayonnées, enfin les Infusoires. Quelle puissance de\r\n  travail! Ne fallait-il pas pour passer de la Botanique, à 50 ans, à\r\n  la Zoologie, et laisser un ouvrage semblable à celui qui illustre\r\n  encore le nom du Botaniste devenue Zoologiste par ordre de la\r\n  Convention!\r\n\r\n  Sans doute dans cet ouvrage il y a bien des choses qui ne sont plus\r\n  acceptables--mais pour le juger avec équité, il faut se porter a\r\n  l'époque où il fut fait, et alors on est pris d'admiration pour\r\n  l'auteur d'un aussi immense travail.\r\n\r\n  J'ai une grande admiration pour le génie de De Lamarck, et je ne\r\n  puis que vous louer de le faire encore mieux connaître de nos\r\n  contemporains.\r\n\r\n  Recevez, mon cher collègue, l'expression de mes sentiments d'estime\r\n  pour vos travaux remarquables et croyez-moi--tout à vous,\r\n\r\n  H. DE LACAZE DUTHIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] For example, while Cuvier's chair was in the field of vertebrate\r\nzoölogy, owing to the kindness of Lamarck (\"_par gracieuseté de la part\r\nde M. de Lamarck_\") he had retained that of Mollusca, and yet it was in\r\nthe special classification of the molluscs that Lamarck did his best\r\nwork (Blainville, _l. c._, p. 116).\r\n\r\n[51] De Blainville states that \"the Academy did not even allow it to be\r\nprinted in the form in which it was pronounced\" (p. 324); and again he\r\nspeaks of the lack of judgment in Cuvier's estimate of Lamarck, \"the\r\nnaturalist who had the greatest force in the general conception of\r\nbeings and of phenomena, although he might often be far from the path\"\r\n(p. 323).\r\n\r\n[52] _Fragments Biographiques_, pp. 209-219.\r\n\r\n[53] _L. c._ p. 81.\r\n\r\n[54] _Histoire Naturelle Drolatique et Philosophique des Professeurs du\r\nJardin des Plantes, _etc._ Par Isid.

For a long period he pursued these studies, and he was the\r\nfirst one to foretell the probabilities of the weather, thus\r\nanticipating by over half a century the modern idea of making the\r\nscience of meteorology of practical use to mankind.\r\n\r\nHis article, \"De l'influence de la lune sur l'atmosphère terrestre,\"\r\nappeared in the _Journal de Physique_ for 1798, and was translated in\r\ntwo English journals. The titles of several other essays will be found\r\nin the Bibliography at the close of this volume.\r\n\r\nFrom 1799 to 1810 he regularly published an annual meteorological report\r\ncontaining the statement of probabilities acquired by a long series of\r\nobservations on the state of the weather and the variations of the\r\natmosphere at different times of the year, giving indications of the\r\nperiods when to expect pleasant weather, or rain, storms, tempests,\r\nfrosts, thaws, etc.; finally the citations of these probabilities of\r\ntimes favorable to fêtes, journeys, voyages, harvesting crops, and\r\nother enterprises dependent on good weather.\r\n\r\nLamarck thus explained the principles on which he based his\r\nprobabilities: Two kinds of causes, he says, displace the fluids which\r\ncompose the atmosphere, some being variable and irregular, others\r\nconstant, whose action is subject to progressive and fixed laws.\r\n\r\nBetween the tropics constant causes exercise an action so considerable\r\nthat the irregular effects of variable causes are there in some degree\r\nlost; hence result the prevailing winds which in these climates become\r\nestablished and change at determinate epochs.\r\n\r\nBeyond the tropics, and especially toward the middle of the temperate\r\nzones, variable causes predominate. We can, however, still discover\r\nthere the effects of the action of constant causes, though much\r\nweakened; we can assign them the principal epochs, and in a great number\r\nof cases make this knowledge turn to our profit. It is in the elevation\r\nand depression (_abaissement_) of the moon above and below the celestial\r\nequator that we should seek for the most constant of these causes.\r\n\r\nWith his usual facility in such matters, he was not long in advancing a\r\ntheory, according to which the atmosphere is regarded as resembling the\r\nsea, having a surface, waves, and storms; it ought likewise to have a\r\nflux and reflux, for the moon ought to exercise the same influence upon\r\nit that it does on the ocean. In the temperate and frigid zones,\r\ntherefore, the wind, which is only the tide of the atmosphere, must\r\ndepend greatly on the declination of the moon; it ought to blow toward\r\nthe pole that is nearest to it, and advancing in that direction only, in\r\norder to reach every place, traversing dry countries or extensive seas,\r\nit ought then to render the sky serene or stormy. If the influence of\r\nthe moon on the weather is denied, it is only that it may be referred to\r\nits phases, but its position in the ecliptic is regarded as affording\r\nprobabilities much nearer the truth.[58]\r\n\r\nIn each of these annuals Lamarck took great care to avoid making any\r\npositive predictions. \"No one,\" he says, \"could make these predictions\r\nwithout deceiving himself and abusing the confidence of persons who\r\nmight place reliance on them.\" He only intended to propose simple\r\nprobabilities.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of the first of these annuals, at the request of\r\nLamarck, who had made it the subject of a memoir read to the Institute\r\nin 1800 (9 ventôse, l'an IX.), Chaptal, Minister of the Interior,\r\nthought it well to establish in France a regular correspondence of\r\nmeteorological observations made daily at different points remote from\r\neach other, and he conferred the direction of it on Lamarck. This system\r\nof meteorological reports lasted but a short time, and was not\r\nmaintained by Chaptal's successor. After three of these annual reports\r\nhad appeared, Lamarck rather suddenly stopped publishing them, and an\r\nincident occurred in connection with their cessation which led to the\r\nstory that he had suffered ill treatment and neglect from Napoleon I.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that Lamarck, who was frank and at times brusque in\r\ncharacter, had made some enemies, and that he had been represented to\r\nthe Emperor as a maker of almanacs and of weather predictions, and that\r\nNapoleon, during a reception, showing to Lamarck his great\r\ndissatisfaction with the annuals, had ordered him to stop their\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nBut according to Bourguin's statement this is not the correct version.\r\nHe tells us:\r\n\r\n  \"According to traditions preserved in the family of Lamarck things\r\n  did not happen so at all. During a reception given to the Institute\r\n  at the Tuileries, Napoleon, who really liked Lamarck, spoke to him\r\n  in a jocular way about his weather probabilities, and Lamarck, very\r\n  much provoked (_très contrarié_) at being thus chaffed in the\r\n  presence of his colleagues, resolved to stop the publication of his\r\n  observations on the weather. What proves that this version is the\r\n  true one is that Lamarck published another annual which he had in\r\n  preparation for the year 1810. In the preface he announced that his\r\n  age, ill health, and his circumstances placed him in the unfortunate\r\n  necessity of ceasing to busy himself with this periodical work. He\r\n  ended by inviting those who had the taste for meteorological\r\n  observations, and the means of devoting their time to it, to take up\r\n  with confidence an enterprise good in itself, based on a genuine\r\n  foundation, and from which the public would derive advantageous\r\n  results.\"\r\n\r\nThese opuscles, such as they were, in which Lamarck treated different\r\nsubjects bearing on the winds, great droughts, rainy seasons, tides,\r\netc., became the precursors of the _Annuaires du Bureau des\r\nLongitudes_.\r\n\r\nAn observation of Lamarck's on a rare and curious form of cloud has\r\nquite recently been referred to by a French meteorologist. It is\r\nprobable, says M. E. Durand-Greville in _La Nature_, November 24, 1900,\r\nthat Lamarck was the first to observe the so-called pocky or festoon\r\ncloud, or mammato-cirrus cloud, which at rare intervals has been\r\nobserved since his time.[59]\r\n\r\nFull of over confidence in the correctness of his views formed without\r\nreference to experiments, although Lavoisier, by his discovery of oxygen\r\nin the years 1772-85, and other researches, had laid the foundations of\r\nthe antiphlogistic or modern chemistry, Lamarck quixotically attempted\r\nto substitute his own speculative views for those of the discoverers of\r\noxygen--Priestley (1774) and the great French chemist Lavoisier.\r\nLamarck, in his _Hydrogéologie_ (1802), went so far as to declare:\r\n\r\n  \"It is not true, and it seems to me even absurd to believe that pure\r\n  air, which has been justly called _vital air_, and which chemists\r\n  now call _oxygen gas_, can be the radical of saline matters--namely,\r\n  can be the principle of acidity, of causticity, or any salinity\r\n  whatever. There are a thousand ways of refuting this error without\r\n  the possibility of a reply.... This hypothesis, the best of all\r\n  those which had been imagined when Lavoisier conceived it, cannot\r\n  now be longer held, since I have discovered what is really\r\n  _caloric_\" (p. 161).\r\n\r\nAfter paying his respects to Priestley, he asks: \"What, then, can be the\r\nreason why the views of chemists and mine are so opposed?\" and complains\r\nthat the former have avoided all written discussion on this subject. And\r\nthis after his three physico-chemical works, the _Réfutation_, the\r\n_Recherches_, and the _Mémoires_ had appeared, and seemed to chemists to\r\nbe unworthy of a reply.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that Lamarck was on this occasion unduly\r\nself-opinionated and stubborn in adhering to such views at a time when\r\nthe physical sciences were being placed on a firm and lasting basis by\r\nexperimental philosophers. The two great lessons of science--to suspend\r\none's judgment and to wait for more light in theoretical matters on\r\nwhich scientific men were so divided--and the necessity of adhering to\r\nhis own line of biological study, where he had facts of his own\r\nobserving on which to rest his opinions, Lamarck did not seem ever to\r\nhave learned.\r\n\r\nThe excuse for his rash and quixotic course in respect to his\r\nphysico-chemical vagaries is that he had great mental activity. Lamarck\r\nwas a synthetic philosopher. He had been brought up in the encyclopædic\r\nperiod of learning. He had from his early manhood been deeply interested\r\nin physical subjects. In middle age he probably lived a very retired\r\nlife, did not mingle with his compeers or discuss his views with them.\r\nSo that when he came to publish them, he found not a single supporter.\r\nHis speculations were received in silence and not deemed worthy of\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nA very just and discriminating judge of Lamarck's work, Professor\r\nCleland, thus refers to his writings on physics and chemistry:\r\n\r\n  \"The most prominent defect in Lamarck must be admitted, quite apart\r\n  from all consideration of the famous hypothesis which bears his\r\n  name, to have been want of control in speculation. Doubtless the\r\n  speculative tendency furnished a powerful incentive to work, but it\r\n  outran the legitimate deductions from observation, and led him into\r\n  the production of volumes of worthless chemistry without\r\n  experimental basis, as well as into spending much time in fruitless\r\n  meteorological predictions.\" (_Encyc. Brit._, Art. LAMARCK.)\r\n\r\nHow a modern physicist regards Lamarck's views on physics may be seen by\r\nthe following statement kindly written for this book by Professor Carl\r\nBarus of Brown University, Providence:\r\n\r\n  \"Lamarck's physical and chemical speculations, made throughout on\r\n  the basis of the alchemistic philosophy of the time, will have\r\n  little further interest to-day than as evidence showing the broadly\r\n  philosophic tendencies of Lamarck's mind. Made without experiment\r\n  and without mathematics, the contents of the three volumes will\r\n  hardly repay perusal, except by the historian interested in certain\r\n  aspects of pre-Lavoisierian science. The temerity with which\r\n  physical phenomena are referred to occult static molecules,\r\n  permeated by subtle fluids, the whole mechanism left without dynamic\r\n  quality, since the mass of the molecule is to be non-essential, is\r\n  markedly in contrast with the discredit into which such hypotheses\r\n  have now fallen. It is true that an explanation of natural phenomena\r\n  in terms \"le feu éthéré, le feu calorique, et le feu fixé\" might be\r\n  interpreted with reference to the modern doctrine of energy; but it\r\n  is certain that Lamarck, antedating Fresnel, Carnot, Ampère, not to\r\n  mention their great followers, had not the faintest inkling of the\r\n  possibility of such an interpretation. Indeed, one may readily\r\n  account for the resemblance to modern views, seeing that all\r\n  speculative systems of science must to some extent run in parallel,\r\n  inasmuch as they begin with the facts of common experience. Nor were\r\n  his speculations in any degree stimulating to theoretical science.\r\n  Many of his mechanisms in which the ether operates on a plane of\r\n  equality with the air can only be regarded with amusement. The whole\r\n  of his elaborate schemes of color classification may be instanced as\r\n  forerunners of the methods commercially in vogue to-day; they are\r\n  not the harbingers of methods scientifically in vogue. One looks in\r\n  vain for research adequate to carry the load of so much speculative\r\n  text.\r\n\r\n  \"Even if we realize that the beginnings of science could but be made\r\n  amid such groping in the dark, it is a pity that a man of Lamarck's\r\n  genius, which seems to have been destitute of the instincts of an\r\n  experimentalist, should have lavished so much serious thought in\r\n  evolving a system of chemical physics out of himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe chemical status of Lamarck's writings is thus stated by Professor H.\r\nCarrington Bolton in a letter dated Washington, D. C., February 9, 1900:\r\n\r\n  \"Excuse delay in replying to your inquiry as to the chemical status\r\n  of the French naturalist, Lamarck. Not until this morning have I\r\n  found it convenient to go to the Library of Congress. That Library\r\n  has not the _Recherches_ nor the _Mémoires_, but the position of\r\n  Lamarck is well known. He had no influence on chemistry, and his\r\n  name is not mentioned in the principal histories of chemistry. He\r\n  made no experiments, but depended upon his imagination for his\r\n  facts; he opposed the tenets of the new French school founded by\r\n  Lavoisier, and proposed a fanciful scheme of abstract principles\r\n  that remind one of alchemy.\r\n\r\n  \"Cuvier, in his _Éloge_ (_Mémoires Acad. Royale des Sciences_,\r\n  1832), estimates Lamarck correctly as respects his position in\r\n  physical science.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck boldly carried the principle of change and evolution into\r\ninorganic nature by the same law of change of circumstances producing\r\nchange of species.\r\n\r\nUnder the head, \"De l'espèce parmi les minéraux,\" p. 149, the author\r\nstates that he had for a long time supposed that there were no species\r\namong minerals. Here, also, he doubts, and boldly, if not rashly, in\r\nthis case, opposes accepted views, and in this field, as elsewhere,\r\nshows, at least, his independence of thought.\r\n\r\n  \"They teach in Paris,\" he says, \"that the integrant molecule of each\r\n  kind of compound is invariable in nature, and consequently that it\r\n  is as old as nature, hence, mineral species are constant.\r\n\r\n  \"For myself, I declare that I am persuaded, and even feel convinced,\r\n  that the integrant molecule of every compound substance whatever,\r\n  may change its nature, namely, may undergo changes in the number and\r\n  in the proportions of the principles which compose it.\"\r\n\r\nHe enlarges on this subject through eight pages. He was evidently led to\r\ntake this view from his assumption that everything, every natural\r\nobject, organic or inorganic, undergoes a change. But it may be\r\nobjected that this view will not apply to minerals, because those of the\r\narchæan rocks do not differ, and have undergone no change since then to\r\nthe present time, unless we except such minerals as are alteration\r\nproducts due to metamorphism. The primary laws of nature, of physics,\r\nand of chemistry are unchangeable, while change, progression from the\r\ngeneralized to the specialized, is distinctly characteristic of the\r\norganic as opposed to the inorganic world.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[58] \"On the Influence of the Moon on the Earth's Atmosphere,\" _Journal\r\nde Physique_, prairial, l'an VI.

And this largely for the reason that he had once travelled, and to\r\nsome extent observed geological phenomena, in the central regions of\r\nFrance, in Germany, and Hungary; visiting mines and collecting ores and\r\nminerals, besides being in a degree familiar with the French cretaceous\r\nfossils, but more especially those of the tertiary strata of Paris and\r\nits vicinity. He had, therefore, from his own experience, slight as it\r\nwas, some solid grounds of facts and observations on which to meditate\r\nand from which to reason.\r\n\r\nHe did not attempt to touch upon cosmological theories--chaos and\r\ncreation--but, rather, confined himself to the earth, and more\r\nparticularly to the action of the ocean, and to the changes which he\r\nbelieved to be due to organic agencies. The most impressive truth in\r\ngeology is the conception of the immensity of past time, and this truth\r\nLamarck fully realized. His views are to be found in a little book of\r\n268 pages, entitled _Hydrogéologie_. It appeared in 1802 (an X.), or\r\nten years before the first publication of Cuvier's famous _Discours sur\r\nles Revolutions de la Surface du Globe_ (1812). Written in his popular\r\nand attractive style, and thoroughly in accord with the cosmological and\r\ntheological prepossessions of the age, the Discours was widely read, and\r\npassed through many editions. On the other hand, the _Hydrogéologie_\r\ndied stillborn, with scarcely a friend or a reader, never reaching a\r\nsecond edition, and is now, like most of his works, a bibliographical\r\nrarity.\r\n\r\nThe only writer who has said a word in its favor, or contrasted it with\r\nthe work of Cuvier, is the judicious and candid Huxley, who, though by\r\nno means favorable to Lamarck's factors of evolution, frankly said:\r\n\r\n  \"The vast authority of Cuvier was employed in support of the\r\n  traditionally respectable hypotheses of special creation and of\r\n  catastrophism; and the wild speculations of the _Discours sur les\r\n  Revolutions de la Surface du Globe_ were held to be models of sound\r\n  scientific thinking, while the really much more sober and\r\n  philosophic hypotheses of the _Hydrogéologie_ were scouted.\"[60]\r\n\r\nBefore summarizing the contents of this book, let us glance at the\r\ngeological atmosphere--thin and tenuous as it was then--in which Lamarck\r\nlived. The credit of being the first observer, before Steno (1669), to\r\nstate that fossils are the remains of animals which were once alive, is\r\ndue to an Italian, Frascatero, of Verona, who wrote in 1517.\r\n\r\n  \"But,\" says Lyell,[61] \"the clear and philosophical views of\r\n  Frascatero were disregarded, and the talent and argumentative powers\r\n  of the learned were doomed for three centuries to be wasted in the\r\n  discussion of these two simple and preliminary questions: First,\r\n  whether fossil remains had ever belonged to living creatures; and,\r\n  secondly, whether, if this be admitted, all the phenomena could not\r\n  be explained by the deluge of Noah.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to this the great artist, architect, engineer, and musician,\r\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), who, among other great works, planned and\r\nexecuted some navigable canals in Northern Italy, and who was an\r\nobserver of rare penetration and judgment, saw how fossil shells were\r\nformed, saying that the mud of rivers had covered and penetrated into\r\nthe interior of fossil shells at a time when these were still at the\r\nbottom of the sea near the coast.[62]\r\n\r\nThat versatile and observing genius, Bernard Palissy, as early as 1580,\r\nin a book entitled _The Origin of Springs from Rain-water_, and in other\r\nwritings, criticized the notions of the time, especially of Italian\r\nwriters, that petrified shells had all been left by the universal\r\ndeluge.\r\n\r\n  \"It has happened,\" said Fontenelle, in his eulogy on Palissy,\r\n  delivered before the French Academy a century and a half later,\r\n  \"that a potter who knew neither Latin nor Greek dared, toward the\r\n  end of the sixteenth century, to say in Paris, and in the presence\r\n  of all the doctors, that fossil shells were veritable shells\r\n  deposited at some time by the sea in the places where they were\r\n  then found; that the animals had given to the figured stones all\r\n  their different shapes, and that he boldly defied all the school of\r\n  Aristotle to attack his proofs.\"[63]\r\n\r\nThen succeeded, at the end of the seventeenth century, the forerunners\r\nof modern geology: Steno (1669), Leibnitz (1683), Ray (1692), Woodward\r\n(1695), Vallisneri (1721), while Moro published his views in 1745. In\r\nthe eighteenth century Réaumur[64] (1720) presented a paper on the\r\nfossil shells of Touraine.\r\n\r\nCuvier[65] thus pays his respects, in at least an unsympathetic way, to\r\nthe geological essayists and compilers of the seventeenth century:\r\n\r\n  \"The end of the seventeenth century lived to see the birth of a new\r\n  science, which took, in its infancy, the high-sounding name of\r\n  'Theory of the Earth.' Starting from a small number of facts, badly\r\n  observed, connecting them by fantastic suppositions, it pretended to\r\n  go back to the origin of worlds, to, as it were, play with them, and\r\n  to create their history. Its arbitrary methods, its pompous\r\n  language, altogether seemed to render it foreign to the other\r\n  sciences, and, indeed, the professional savants for a long time cast\r\n  it out of the circle of their studies.\"\r\n\r\nTheir views, often premature, composed of half-truths, were mingled with\r\nglaring errors and fantastic misconceptions, but were none the less\r\ngerminal. Leibnitz was the first to propose the nebular hypothesis,\r\nwhich was more fully elaborated by Kant and Laplace. Buffon, influenced\r\nby the writing of Leibnitz, in his _Théorie de la Terre_, published in\r\n1749, adopted his notion of an original volcanic nucleus and a universal\r\nocean, the latter as he thought leaving the land dry by draining into\r\nsubterranean caverns. He also dimly saw, or gathered from his reading,\r\nthat the mountains and valleys were due to secondary causes; that\r\nfossiliferous strata had been deposited by ocean currents, and that\r\nrivers had transported materials from the highlands to the lowlands. He\r\nalso states that many of the fossil shells which occur in Europe do not\r\nlive in the adjacent seas, and that there are remains of fishes and of\r\nplants not now living in Europe, and which are either extinct or live in\r\nmore southern climates, and others in tropical seas. Also that the bones\r\nand teeth of elephants and of the rhinoceros and hippopotamus found in\r\nSiberia and elsewhere in northern Europe and Asia indicate that these\r\nanimals must have lived there, though at present restricted to the\r\ntropics. In his last essay, _Époques de la Nature_ (1778), he claims\r\nthat the earth's history may be divided into epochs, from the earliest\r\nto the present time. The first epoch was that of fluidity, of\r\nincandescence, when the earth and the planets assumed their form; the\r\nsecond, of cooling; the third, when the waters covered the earth, and\r\nvolcanoes began to be active; the fourth, that of the retreat of the\r\nseas, and the fifth the age when the elephants, the hippopotamus, and\r\nother southern animals lived in the regions of the north; the sixth,\r\nwhen the two continents, America and the old world, became separate; the\r\nseventh and last being the age of man. Above all, by his attractive\r\nstyle and bold suggestions he popularized the subjects and created an\r\ninterest in these matters and a spirit of inquiry which spread\r\nthroughout France and the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the crude and uncritical nature of the writings of\r\nthe second half of the eighteenth century, resulting from the lack of\r\nthat more careful and detailed observation which characterizes our day,\r\nthere was during this period a widespread interest in physical and\r\nnatural science, and it led up to that more exact study of nature which\r\nsignalizes the nineteenth century. \"More new truths concerning the\r\nexternal world,\" says Buckle, \"were discovered in France during the\r\nlatter half of the eighteenth century than during all preceding periods\r\nput together.\"[66] As Perkins[67] says: \"Interest in scientific study,\r\nas in political investigation, seemed to rise suddenly from almost\r\ncomplete inactivity to extraordinary development. In both departments\r\nEnglish thinkers had led the way, but if the impulse to such\r\ninvestigations came from without, the work done in France in every\r\nbranch of scientific research during the eighteenth century was excelled\r\nby no other nation, and England alone could assert any claim to results\r\nof equal importance. The researches of Coulomb in electricity, of Buffon\r\nin geology, of Lavoisier in chemistry, of Daubenton in comparative\r\nanatomy, carried still farther by their illustrious successors towards\r\nthe close of the century, did much to establish conceptions of the\r\nuniverse and its laws upon a scientific basis.\" And not only did\r\nRousseau make botany fashionable, but Goldsmith wrote from Paris in\r\n1755: \"I have seen as bright a circle of beauty at the chemical lectures\r\nof Rouelle as gracing the court of Versailles.\" Petit lectured on\r\nastronomy to crowded houses, and among his listeners were gentlemen and\r\nladies of fashion, as well as professional students.[68] The\r\npopularizers of science during this period were Voltaire, Montesquieu,\r\nAlembert, Diderot, and other encyclopædists.\r\n\r\nHere should be mentioned one of Buffon's contemporaries and countrymen;\r\none who was the first true field geologist, an observer rather than a\r\ncompiler or theorist. This was Jean E. Guettard (1715-1786). He\r\npublished, says Sir Archibald Geikie, in his valuable work, _The\r\nFounders of Geology_, about two hundred papers on a wide range of\r\nscientific subjects, besides half a dozen quarto volumes of his\r\nobservations, together with many excellent plates. Geikie also states\r\nthat he is undoubtedly entitled to rank among the first great pioneers\r\nof modern geology. He was the first (1751) to make a geological map of\r\nnorthern France, and roughly traced the limits of his three bands or\r\nformations from France across the southeastern English counties. In his\r\nwork on \"The degradation of mountains effected in our time by heavy\r\nrains, rivers, and the sea,\"[69] he states that the sea is the most\r\npotent destroyer of the land, and that the material thus removed is\r\ndeposited either on the land or along the shores of the sea. He thought\r\nthat the levels of the valleys are at present being raised, owing to the\r\ndeposit of detritus in them. He points out that the deposits laid down\r\nby the ocean do not extend far out to sea, \"that consequently the\r\nelevations of new mountains in the sea, by the deposition of sediment,\r\nis a process very difficult to conceive; that the transport of the\r\nsediment as far as the equator is not less improbable; and that still\r\nmore difficult to accept is the suggestion that the sediment from our\r\ncontinent is carried into the seas of the New World. In short, we are\r\nstill very little advanced towards the theory of the earth as it now\r\nexists.\" Guettard was the first to discover the volcanoes of Auvergne,\r\nbut he was \"hopelessly wrong\" in regard to the origin of basalt,\r\nforestalling Werner in his mistakes as to its aqueous origin. He was\r\nthus the first Neptunist, while, as Geikie states, his \"observations in\r\nAuvergne practically started the Vulcanist camp.\"\r\n\r\nWe now come to Lamarck's own time. He must have been familiar with the\r\nresults of Pallas's travels in Russia and Siberia (1793-94). The\r\ndistinguished German zoölogist and geologist, besides working out the\r\ngeology of the Ural Mountains, showed, in 1777, that there was a general\r\nlaw in the formation of all mountain chains composed chiefly of primary\r\nrocks;[70] the granitic axis being flanked by schists, and these by\r\nfossiliferous strata. From his observations made on the Volga and about\r\nits mouth, he presented proofs of the former extension, in comparatively\r\nrecent times, of the Caspian Sea. But still more pregnant and remarkable\r\nwas his discovery of an entire rhinoceros, with its flesh and skin, in\r\nthe frozen soil of Siberia. His memoir on this animal places him among\r\nthe forerunners of, if not within the ranks of, the founders of\r\npalæontology.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Soldani, an Italian, had, in 1780, shown that the limestone\r\nstrata of Italy had accumulated in a deep sea, at least far from land,\r\nand he was the first to observe the alternation of marine and\r\nfresh-water strata in the Paris basin.\r\n\r\nLamarck must have taken much interest in the famous controversy between\r\nthe Vulcanists and Neptunists. He visited Freyburg in 1771; whether he\r\nmet Werner is not known, as Werner began to lecture in 1775. He must\r\nhave personally known Faujas of Paris, who, in 1779, published his\r\ndescription of the volcanoes of Vivarais and Velay; while Desmarest's\r\n(1725-1815) elaborate work on the volcanoes of Auvergne, published in\r\n1774, in which he proved the igneous origin of basalt, was the best\r\npiece of geological exploration which had yet been accomplished, and is\r\nstill a classic.[71]\r\n\r\nWerner (1750-1817), the propounder of the Neptunian theory, was one of\r\nthe founders of modern geology and of palæontology. His work entitled\r\n_Ueber die aüssern Kennzeichen der Fossilien_ appeared in 1774; his\r\n_Kurze Klassifikation und Beschreibung der Gebirgsarten_ in 1787. He\r\ndiscovered the law of the superposition of stratified rocks, though he\r\nwrongly considered volcanic rocks, such as basalt, to be of aqueous\r\norigin, being as he supposed formed of chemical precipitates from water.\r\nBut he was the first to state that the age of different formations can\r\nbe told by their fossils, certain species being confined to particular\r\nbeds, while others ranged throughout whole formations, and others seemed\r\nto occur in several different formations; \"the original species found in\r\nthese formations appearing to have been so constituted as to live\r\nthrough a variety of changes which had destroyed hundreds of other\r\nspecies which we find confined to particular beds.\"[72] His views as\r\nregards fossils, as Jameson states, were probably not known to Cuvier,\r\nand it is more than doubtful whether Lamarck knew of them. He observed\r\nthat fossils appear first in \"transition\" or palæozoic strata, and were\r\nmainly corals and molluscs; that in the older carboniferous rocks the\r\nfossils are of higher types, such as fish and amphibious animals; while\r\nin the tertiary or alluvial strata occur the remains of birds and\r\nquadrupeds. He thought that marine plants were more ancient than land\r\nplants. His studies led him to infer that the fossils contained in the\r\noldest rocks are very different from any of the species of the present\r\ntime; that the newer the formation, the more do the remains approach in\r\nform to the organic beings of the present creation, and that in the\r\nvery latest formations, fossil remains of species now existing occur.\r\nSuch advanced views as these would seem to entitle Werner to rank as one\r\nof the founders of palæontology.[73]\r\n\r\nHutton's _Theory of the Earth_ appeared in 1785, and in a more developed\r\nstate, as a separate work, in 1795.[74] \"The ruins of an older world,\"\r\nhe said, \"are visible in the present structure of our planet, and the\r\nstrata which now compose our continents have been once beneath the sea,\r\nand were formed out of the waste of preëxisting continents. The same\r\nforces are still destroying, by chemical decomposition or mechanical\r\nviolence, even the hardest rocks, and transporting the materials to the\r\nsea, where they are spread out and form strata analogous to those of\r\nmore ancient date. Although loosely deposited along the bottom of the\r\nocean, they became afterwards altered and consolidated by volcanic heat,\r\nand were then heaved up, fractured, and contorted.\" Again he said: \"In\r\nthe economy of the world I can find no traces of a beginning, no\r\nprospect of an end.\" As Lyell remarks: \"Hutton imagined that the\r\ncontinents were first gradually destroyed by aqueous degradation, and\r\nwhen their ruins had furnished materials for new continents, they were\r\nupheaved by violent convulsions. He therefore required alternate periods\r\nof general disturbance and repose.\"\r\n\r\nTo Hutton, therefore, we are indebted for the idea of the immensity of\r\nthe duration of time. He was the forerunner of Lyell and of the\r\nuniformitarian school of geologists.\r\n\r\nHutton observed that fossils characterized certain strata, but the value\r\nof fossils as time-marks and the principle of the superposition of\r\nstratified fossiliferous rocks were still more clearly established by\r\nWilliam Smith, an English surveyor, in 1790. Meanwhile the Abbé Haüy,\r\nthe founder of crystallography, was in 1802 Professor of Mineralogy in\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lamarck's Contributions to Physical Geology; his Theory of the Earth._\r\n\r\nSuch were the amount and kind of knowledge regarding the origin and\r\nstructure of our earth which existed at the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, while Lamarck was meditating his _Hydrogéologie_, and had begun\r\nto study the invertebrate fossils of the Paris tertiary basin.\r\n\r\nHis object, he says in his work, is to present certain considerations\r\nwhich he believed to be new and of the first order, which had escaped\r\nthe notice of physicists, and which seemed to him should serve as the\r\nfoundations for a good theory of the earth. His theses are:\r\n\r\n  1. What are the natural consequences of the influence and the\r\n  movements of the waters on the surface of the globe?\r\n\r\n  2. Why does the sea constantly occupy a basin within the limits\r\n  which contain it, and there separate the dry parts of the surface of\r\n  the globe always projecting above it?\r\n\r\n  3. Has the ocean basin always existed where we actually see it, and\r\n  if we find proofs of the sojourn of the sea in places where it no\r\n  longer remains, by what cause was it found there, and why is it no\r\n  longer there?\r\n\r\n  4. What influence have living bodies exerted on the substances found\r\n  on the surface of the earth and which compose the crust which\r\n  invests it, and what are the general results of this influence?\r\n\r\nLamarck then disclaims any intentions of framing brilliant hypotheses\r\nbased on supposititious principles, but nevertheless, as we shall see,\r\nhe falls into this same error, and like others of his period makes some\r\npreposterous hypotheses, though these are far less so than those of\r\nCuvier's _Discours_. He distinguishes between the action of rivers or of\r\nfresh-water currents, torrents, storms, the melting of snow, and the\r\nwork of the ocean. The rivers wear away and bear materials from the\r\nhighlands to the lowlands, so that the plains are gradually elevated;\r\nravines form and become immense valleys, and their sides form elevated\r\ncrests and pass into mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nHe brings out and emphasizes the fact, now so well known, that the\r\nerosive action of rain and rivers has formed mountains of a certain\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n  \"It is then evident to me, that every mountain which is not the\r\n  result of a _volcanic irruption_ or of some local catastrophe, has\r\n  been carved out from a plain, where its mass is gradually formed,\r\n  and was a part of it; hence what in this case are the summits of\r\n  the mountains are only the remains of the former level of the plain\r\n  unless the process of washing away and other means of degradation\r\n  have not since reduced its height.\"\r\n\r\nNow this will apply perfectly well to our table-lands, mesas, the\r\nmountains of our bad-lands, even to our Catskills and to many elevations\r\nof this nature in France and in northern Africa. But Lamarck\r\nunfortunately does not stop here, but with the zeal of an innovator, by\r\nno means confined to his time alone, claims that the mountain masses of\r\nthe Alps and the Andes were carved out of plains which had been raised\r\nabove the sea-level to the present heights of those mountains.\r\n\r\nTwo causes, he says, have concurred in forming these elevated plains.\r\n\r\n  \"One consists in the continual accumulation of material filling the\r\n  portion of the ocean-basin from which the same seas slowly retreat;\r\n  for it does not abandon those parts of the ocean-basin which are\r\n  situated nearer and nearer to the shores that it tends to leave,\r\n  until after having filled its bottom and having gradually raised it.\r\n  It follows that the coasts which the sea is abandoning are never\r\n  made by a very deep-lying formation, however often it appears to be\r\n  such, for they are continually elevated as the result of the\r\n  perpetual balancing of the sea, which casts off from its shores all\r\n  the sediments brought down by the rivers; in such a way that the\r\n  great depths of the ocean are not near the shore from which the sea\r\n  retreats, but out in the middle of the ocean and near the opposite\r\n  shores which the sea tends to invade.\r\n\r\n  \"The other cause, as we shall see, is found in the detritus of\r\n  organic bodies successively accumulated, which perpetually elevates,\r\n  although with extreme slowness, the soil of the dry portions of the\r\n  globe, and which does it all the more rapidly, as the situation of\r\n  these parts gives less play to the degradation of the surface caused\r\n  by the rivers.\r\n\r\n  \"Doubtless a plain which is destined some day to furnish the\r\n  mountains which the rivers will carve out from its mass would have,\r\n  when still but a little way from the sea, but a moderate elevation\r\n  above its river channels; but gradually as the ocean basin removed\r\n  from this plain, this basin constantly sinking down into the\r\n  interior (_épaisseur_) of the external crust of the globe, and the\r\n  soil of the plain perpetually rising higher from the deposition of\r\n  the detritus of organic bodies, it results that, after ages of\r\n  elevation of the plain in question, it would be in the end\r\n  sufficiently thick for high mountains to be shaped and carved out of\r\n  its mass.\r\n\r\n  \"Although the ephemeral length of life of man prevents his\r\n  appreciation of this fact, it is certain that the soil of a plain\r\n  unceasingly acquires a real increase in its elevation in proportion\r\n  as it is covered with different plants and animals. Indeed the\r\n  débris successively heaped up for numerous generations of all these\r\n  beings which have by turns perished, and which, as the result of the\r\n  action of their organs, have, during the course of this life, given\r\n  rise to combinations which would never have existed without this\r\n  means, most of the principles which have formed them not being\r\n  borrowed from the soil; this débris, I say, wasting successively on\r\n  the soil of the plain in question, gradually increases the thickness\r\n  of its external bed, multiplies there the mineral matters of all\r\n  kinds and gradually elevates the formation.\"\r\n\r\nOur author, as is evident, had no conception, nor had any one else at\r\nthe time he wrote, of the slow secular elevation of a continental\r\nplateau by crust-movements, and Lamarck's idea of the formation of\r\nelevated plains on land by the accumulation of débris of organisms is\r\nmanifestly inadequate, our aërial or eolian rocks and loess being\r\nwind-deposits of sand and silt rather than matters of organic origin.\r\nThus he cites as an example of his theory the vast elevated plains of\r\nTartary, which he thought had been dry land from time immemorable,\r\nthough we now know that the rise took place in the quaternary or present\r\nperiod. On the other hand, given these vast elevated plains, he was\r\ncorrect in affirming that rivers flowing through them wore out enormous\r\nvalleys and carved out high mountains, left standing by atmospheric\r\nerosion, for examples of such are to be seen in the valley of the Nile,\r\nthe Colorado, the Upper Missouri, etc.\r\n\r\nHe then distinguishes between granitic or crystalline mountains, and\r\nthose composed of stratified rocks and volcanic mountains.\r\n\r\nThe erosive action of rivers is thus discussed; they tend first, he\r\nsays, to fill up the ocean basins, and second, to make the surface of\r\nthe land broken and mountainous, by excavating and furrowing the plains.\r\n\r\nOur author did not at all understand the causes of the inclination or\r\ntilting up of strata. Little close observation or field work had yet\r\nbeen done, and the rocks about Paris are but slightly if at all\r\ndisturbed. He attributes the dipping down of strata to the inclination\r\nof the shores of the sea, though he adds that nevertheless it is often\r\ndue to local subsidences. And then he remarks that \"indeed in many\r\nmountains, and especially in the Pyrenees, in the very centre of these\r\nmountains, we observe that the strata are for the most part either\r\nvertical or so inclined that they more or less approach this direction.\"\r\n\r\n  \"But,\" he asks, \"should we conclude from this that there has\r\n  necessarily occurred a universal catastrophe, a general overturning?\r\n  This assumption, so convenient for those naturalists who would\r\n  explain all the facts of this kind without taking the trouble to\r\n  observe and study the course which nature follows, is not at all\r\n  necessary here; for it is easy to conceive that the inclined\r\n  direction of the beds in the mountains may have been produced by\r\n  other causes, and especially by causes more natural and less\r\n  hypothetical than a general overturning of strata.\"\r\n\r\nWhile streams of fresh water tend to fill up and destroy the ocean\r\nbasins, he also insists that the movements of the sea, such as the\r\ntides, currents, storms, submarine volcanoes, etc., on the contrary,\r\ntend to unceasingly excavate and reëstablish these basins. Of course we\r\nnow know that tides and currents have no effect in the ocean depths,\r\nthough their scouring effects near shore in shallow waters have locally\r\nhad a marked effect in changing the relations of land and sea. Lamarck\r\nwent so far as to insist that the ocean basin owes its existence and its\r\npreservation to the scouring action of the tides and currents.\r\n\r\nThe earth's interior was, in Lamarck's opinion, solid, formed of\r\nquartzose and silicious rocks, and its centre of gravity did not\r\ncoincide with its geographical centre, or what he calls the _centre de\r\nforme_. He imagined also that the ocean revolved around the globe from\r\neast to west, and that this movement, by its continuity, displaced the\r\nocean basin and made it pass successively over all the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThen, in the third chapter, he asks if the basin of the sea has always\r\nbeen where we now actually see it, and whether we find proofs of the\r\nsojourn of the sea in the place where it is now absent; if so, what are\r\nthe causes of these changes. He reiterates his strange idea of a general\r\nmovement of the ocean from east to west, at the rate of at least three\r\nleagues in twenty-four hours and due to the moon's influence. And here\r\nLamarck, in spite of his uniformitarian principles, is strongly\r\ncataclysmic. What he seems to have in mind is the great equatorial\r\ncurrent between Africa and the West Indies. To this perpetual movement\r\nof the waters of the Atlantic Ocean he ventures to attribute the\r\nexcavation of the Gulf of Mexico, and presumes that at the end of ages\r\nit will break through the Isthmus of Panama, and transform America into\r\ntwo great islands or two small continents. Not understanding that the\r\nislands are either the result of upheaval, or outliers of continents,\r\ndue to subsidence, Lamarck supposed that his westward flow of the ocean,\r\ndue to the moon's attraction, eroded the eastern shores of America, and\r\nthe currents thus formed \"in their efforts to move westward, arrested by\r\nAmerica and by the eastern coasts of China, were in great part diverted\r\ntowards the South Pole, and seeking to break through a passage across\r\nthe ancient continent have, a long time since, reduced the portion of\r\nthis continent which united New Holland to Asia into an archipelago\r\nwhich comprises the Molucca, Philippine, and Mariana Islands.\" The West\r\nIndies and Windward Islands were formed by the same means, and the sea\r\nnot breaking through the Isthmus of Panama was turned southward, and the\r\naction of its currents resulted in detaching the island of Tierra del\r\nFuego from South America. In like manner New Zealand was separated from\r\nNew Holland, Madagascar from Africa, and Ceylon from India.\r\n\r\nHe then refers to other \"displacements of the ocean basin,\" to the\r\nshallowing of the Straits of Sunda, of the Baltic Sea, the ancient\r\nsubsidence of the coast of Holland and Zealand, and states that Sweden\r\noffers all the appearance of having recently emerged from the sea, while\r\nthe Caspian Sea, formerly much larger than at present, was once in\r\ncommunication with the Black Sea, and that some day the Straits of Sunda\r\nand the Straits of Dover will be dry land, so that the union of England\r\nand France will be formed anew.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, with these facts known to him, Lamarck did not see\r\nthat such changes were due to changes of level of the land rather than\r\nto their being abandoned or invaded by the sea, but explained these by\r\nhis bizarre hypothesis of westward-flowing currents due to the moon's\r\naction; though it should be in all fairness stated that down to recent\r\ntimes there have been those who believed that it is the sea and not the\r\nland which has changed its level.\r\n\r\nThis idea, that the sea and not the land has changed its level, was\r\ngenerally held at the time Lamarck wrote, though Strabo had made the\r\nshrewd observation that it was the land which moved. The Greek\r\ngeographer threw aside the notion of some of his contemporaries, and\r\nwith wonderful prevision, considering the time he wrote and the limited\r\nobservations he could make, claimed that it is not the sea which has\r\nrisen or fallen, but the land itself which is sometimes raised up and\r\nsometimes depressed, while the sea-bottom may also be elevated or sunk\r\ndown. He refers to such facts as deluges, earthquakes, and volcanic\r\neruptions, and sudden swellings of the land beneath the sea.\r\n\r\n  \"And it is not merely the small, but the large islands also, not\r\n  merely the islands, but the continents which can be lifted up\r\n  together with the sea; and, too, the large and small tracts may\r\n  subside, for habitations and cities, like Bure, Bizona, and many\r\n  others, have been engulfed by earthquakes.\"[75]\r\n\r\nBut it was not until eighteen centuries later that this doctrine, under\r\nthe teachings of Playfair, Leopold von Buch, and Élie de Beaumont\r\n(1829-30) became generally accepted. In 1845 Humboldt remarked, \"It is a\r\nfact to-day recognized by all geologists, that the rise of continents is\r\ndue to an actual upheaval, and not to an apparent subsidence occasioned\r\nby a general depression of the level of the sea\" (_Cosmos_, i). Yet as\r\nlate as 1869 we have an essay by H. Trautschold[76] in which is a\r\nstatement of the arguments which can be brought forward in favor of the\r\ndoctrine that the increase of the land above sea level is due to the\r\nretirement of the sea.[77]\r\n\r\nAs authentic and unimpeachable proofs of the former existence of the sea\r\nwhere now it is absent, Lamarck cites the occurrence of fossils in rocks\r\ninland. Lamarck's first paper on fossils was read to the Institute in\r\n1799, or about three years previous to the publication of the\r\n_Hydrogéologie_. He restricts the term \"fossils\" to vegetable and animal\r\nremains, since the word in his time was by some loosely applied to\r\nminerals as well as fossils; to anything dug out of the earth. \"We find\r\nfossils,\" he says, \"on dry land, even in the middle of continents and\r\nlarge islands; and not only in places far removed from the sea, but even\r\non mountains and in their bowels, at considerable heights, each part of\r\nthe earth's surface having at some time been a veritable ocean bottom.\"\r\nHe then quotes at length accounts of such instances from Buffon, and\r\nnotices their prodigious number, and that while the greater number are\r\nmarine, others are fresh-water and terrestrial shells, and the marine\r\nshells may be divided into littoral and pelagic.\r\n\r\n  \"This distinction is very important to make, because the\r\n  consideration of fossils is, as we have already said, one of the\r\n  principal means of knowing well the revolutions which have taken\r\n  place on the surface of our globe. This subject is of great\r\n  importance, and under this point of view it should lead naturalists\r\n  to study fossil shells, in order to compare them with their\r\n  analogues which we can discover in the sea; finally, to carefully\r\n  seek the places where each species lives, the banks which are\r\n  formed of them, the different beds which these banks may present,\r\n  etc., etc., so that we do not believe it out of place to insert here\r\n  the principal considerations which have already resulted from that\r\n  which is known in this respect.\r\n\r\n\"_The fossils which are found in the dry parts of the surface of the\r\nglobe are evident indications of a long sojourn of the sea in the very\r\nplaces where we observe them._\" Under this heading, after repeating the\r\nstatement previously made that fossils occur in all parts of the dry\r\nland, in the midst of the continents and on high mountains, he inquires\r\n_by what cause_ so many marine shells could be found in the explored\r\nparts of the world. Discarding the old idea that they are monuments of\r\nthe deluge, transformed into fossils, he denies that there was such a\r\ngeneral catastrophe as a universal deluge, and goes on to say in his\r\nassured, but calm and philosophic way:\r\n\r\n  \"On the globe which we inhabit, everything is submitted to continual\r\n  and inevitable changes, which result from the essential order of\r\n  things: they take place, in truth, with more or less promptitude or\r\n  slowness, according to the nature, the condition, or the situation\r\n  of the objects; nevertheless they are wrought in some time or other.\r\n\r\n  \"To nature, time is nothing, and it never presents a difficulty; she\r\n  always has it at her disposal, and it is for her a means without\r\n  limit, with which she has made the greatest as well as the least\r\n  things.\r\n\r\n  \"The changes to which everything in this world is subjected are\r\n  changes not only of form and of nature, but they are changes also of\r\n  bulk, and even of situation.\r\n\r\n  \"All the considerations stated in the preceding chapters should\r\n  convince us that nothing on the surface of the terrestrial globe is\r\n  immutable. They teach us that the vast ocean which occupies so great\r\n  a part of the surface of our globe cannot have its bed constantly\r\n  fixed in the same place; that the dry or exposed parts of this\r\n  surface themselves undergo perpetual changes in their condition, and\r\n  that they are in turn successively invaded and abandoned by the sea.\r\n\r\n  \"There is, indeed, every evidence that these enormous masses of\r\n  water continually displace themselves, both their bed and their\r\n  limits.\r\n\r\n  \"In truth these displacements, which are never interrupted, are in\r\n  general only made with extreme and almost inappreciable slowness,\r\n  but they are in ceaseless operation, and with such constancy that\r\n  the ocean bottom, which necessarily loses on one side while it gains\r\n  on another, has already, without doubt, spread over not only once,\r\n  but even several times, every point of the surface of the globe.\r\n\r\n  \"If it is thus, if each point of the surface of the terrestrial\r\n  globe has been in turn dominated by the seas--that is to say, has\r\n  contributed to form the bed of those immense masses of water which\r\n  constitute the ocean--it should result (1) that the insensible but\r\n  uninterrupted transfer of the bed of the ocean over the whole\r\n  surface of the globe has given place to deposits of the remains of\r\n  marine animals which we should find in a fossil state; (2) that this\r\n  translation of the ocean basin should be the reason why the dry\r\n  portions of the earth are always more elevated than the level of the\r\n  sea; so that the old ocean bed should become exposed without being\r\n  elevated above the sea, and without consequently giving rise to the\r\n  formation of mountains which we observe in so many different regions\r\n  of the naked parts of our globe.\"\r\n\r\nThus littoral shells of many genera, such as Pectens, Tellinæ, cockle\r\nshells, turban shells (_sabots_), etc., madrepores and other littoral\r\npolyps, the bones of marine or of amphibious animals which have lived\r\nnear the sea, and which occur as fossils, are then unimpeachable\r\nmonuments of the sojourn of the sea on the points of the dry parts of\r\nthe globe where we observe their deposits, and besides these occur\r\ndeep-water forms. \"Thus the encrinites, the belemnites, the\r\northoceratites, the ostracites, the terebratules, etc., all animals\r\nwhich habitually live at the bottom, found for the most part among the\r\nfossils deposited on the point of the globe in question, are\r\nunimpeachable witnesses which attest that this same place was once part\r\nof the bottom or great depths of the sea.\" He then attempts to prove,\r\nand does so satisfactorily, that the shells he refers to are what he\r\ncalls deep-water (pélagiennes). He proves the truth of his thesis by the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\n  1. We are already familiar with a marine Gryphæa, and different\r\n  Terebratulæ, also marine shell-fish, which do not, however, live\r\n  near shore. 2. Also the greatest depth which has been reached with\r\n  the rake or the dredge is not destitute of molluscs, since we find\r\n  there a great number which only live at this depth, and without\r\n  instruments to reach and bring them up we should know nothing of the\r\n  _cones_, _olives_, Mitra, many species of Murex, Strombus, etc. 3.\r\n  Finally, since the discovery of a living Encrinus, drawn up on a\r\n  sounding line from a great depth, and where lives the animal or\r\n  polyp in question, it is not only possible to assure ourselves that\r\n  at this depth there are other living animals, but on the contrary we\r\n  are strongly bound to think that other species of the same genus,\r\n  and probably other animals of different genera, also live at the\r\n  same depths. All this leads one to admit, with Bruguière,[78] the\r\n  existence of deep-water shell-fish and polyps, which, like him, I\r\n  distinguish from littoral shells and polyps.\r\n\r\n  \"The two sorts of monuments of which I have above spoken, namely,\r\n  littoral and deep-sea fossils, may be, and often should be, found\r\n  separated by different beds in the same bank or in the same\r\n  mountains, since they have been deposited there at very different\r\n  epochs. But they may often be found mixed together, because the\r\n  movements of the water, the currents, submarine volcanoes, etc.,\r\n  have overturned the beds, yet some regular deposits in water always\r\n  tranquil would be left in quite distant beds.... Every dry part of\r\n  the earth's surface, when the presence or the abundance of marine\r\n  fossils prove that formerly the sea has remained in that place, has\r\n  necessarily twice received, for a single incursion of the sea,\r\n  littoral shells, and once deep-sea shells, in three different\r\n  deposits--this will not be disputed. But as such an incursion of the\r\n  sea can only be accomplished by a period of immense duration, it\r\n  follows that the littoral shells deposited at the first sojourn of\r\n  the edge of the sea, and constituting the first deposit, have been\r\n  destroyed--that is to say, have not been preserved to the present\r\n  time; while the deep-water shells form the second deposit, and there\r\n  the littoral shells of the third deposit are, in fact, the only ones\r\n  which now exist, and which constitute the fossils that we see.\"\r\n\r\nHe again asserts that these deposits could not be the result of any\r\nsudden catastrophe, because of the necessarily long sojourn of the sea\r\nto account for the extensive beds of fossil shells, the remains of\r\n\"infinitely multiplied generations of shelled animals which have lived\r\nin this place, and have there successively deposited their débris.\" He\r\ntherefore supposes that these remains, \"continually heaped up, have\r\nformed these shell banks, become fossilized after the lapse of\r\nconsiderable time, and in which it is often possible to distinguish\r\ndifferent beds.\" He then continues his line of anti-catastrophic\r\nreasoning, and we must remember that in his time facts in biology and\r\ngeology were feebly grasped, and scientific reasoning or induction was\r\nin its infancy.\r\n\r\n  \"I would again inquire how, in the supposition of a universal\r\n  catastrophe, there could have been preserved an infinity of delicate\r\n  shells which the least shock would break, but of which we now find a\r\n  great number uninjured among other fossils. How also could it happen\r\n  that bivalve shells, with which calcareous rocks and even those\r\n  changed into a silicious condition are interlarded, should be all\r\n  still provided with their two valves, as I have stated, if the\r\n  animals of these shells had not lived in these places?\r\n\r\n  \"There is no doubt but that the remains of so many molluscs, that so\r\n  many shells deposited and consequently changed into fossils, and\r\n  most of which were totally destroyed before their substance became\r\n  silicified, furnished a great part of the calcareous matter which we\r\n  observe on the surface and in the upper beds of the earth.\r\n\r\n  \"Nevertheless there is in the sea, for the formation of calcareous\r\n  matter, a cause which is greater than shelled molluscs, which is\r\n  consequently still more powerful, and to which must be referred\r\n  ninety-nine hundredths, and indeed more, of the calcareous matter\r\n  occurring in nature. This cause, so important to consider, is the\r\n  existence of _coralligenous polyps_, which we might therefore call\r\n  _testaceous polyps_, because, like the testaceous molluscs, these\r\n  polyps have the faculty of forming, by a transudation or a continual\r\n  secretion of their bodies, the stony and calcareous polypidom on\r\n  which they live.\r\n\r\n  \"In truth these polyps are animals so small that a single one only\r\n  forms a minute quantity of calcareous matter. But in this case what\r\n  nature does not obtain in any volume or in quantity from any one\r\n  individual, she simply receives by the number of animals in\r\n  question, through the enormous multiplicity of these animals, and\r\n  their astonishing fecundity--namely, by the wonderful faculty they\r\n  have of promptly regenerating, of multiplying in a short time their\r\n  generations successively, and rapidly accumulating; finally, by the\r\n  total amount of reunion of the products of these numerous little\r\n  animals.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, it is a fact now well known and well established that the\r\n  coralligenous polyps, namely, this great family of animals with\r\n  coral stocks, such as the millepores, the madrepores, astrææ,\r\n  meandrinæ, etc., prepare on a great scale at the bottom of the sea,\r\n  by a continual secretion of their bodies, and as the result of their\r\n  enormous multiplication and their accumulated generations, the\r\n  greatest part of the calcareous matter which exists. The numerous\r\n  coral stocks which these animals produce, and whose bulk and numbers\r\n  perpetually increase, form in certain places islands of considerable\r\n  extent, fill up extensive bays, gulfs, and roadsteads; in a word,\r\n  close harbors, and entirely change the condition of coasts.\r\n\r\n  \"These enormous banks of madrepores and millepores, heaped upon each\r\n  other, covered and intermingled with serpulæ, different kinds of\r\n  oysters, patellæ, barnacles, and other shells fixed by their base,\r\n  form irregular mountains of an almost limitless extent.\r\n\r\n  \"But when, after the lapse of considerable time, the sea has left\r\n  the places where these immense deposits are laid down, then the slow\r\n  but combined alteration that these great masses undergo, left\r\n  uncovered and exposed to the incessant action of the air, light, and\r\n  a variable humidity, changes them gradually into fossils and\r\n  destroys their membranous or gelatinous part, which is the readiest\r\n  to decompose. This alteration, which the enormous masses of the\r\n  corals in question continued to undergo, caused their structure to\r\n  gradually disappear, and their great porosity unceasingly diminished\r\n  the parts of these stony masses by displacing and again bringing\r\n  together the molecules composing them, so that, undergoing a new\r\n  aggregation, these calcareous molecules obtained a number of points\r\n  of contact, and constituted harder and more compact masses. It\r\n  finally results that instead of the original masses of madrepores\r\n  and millepores there occurs only masses of a compact calcareous\r\n  rock, which modern mineralogists have improperly called _primitive\r\n  limestone_, because, seeing in it no traces of shells or corals,\r\n  they have mistaken these stony masses for deposits of a matter\r\n  primitively existing in nature.\"\r\n\r\nHe then reiterates the view that these deposits of marble and\r\nlimestones, often forming mountain ranges, could not have been the\r\nresult of a universal catastrophe, and in a very modern way goes on to\r\nspecify what the limits of catastrophism are. The only catastrophes\r\nwhich a naturalist can reasonably admit as having taken place are\r\npartial or local ones, those dependent on causes acting in isolated\r\nplaces, such as the disturbances which are caused by volcanic eruptions,\r\nby earthquakes, by local inundations, by violent storms, etc. These\r\ncatastrophes are with reason admissible, because we observe their\r\nanalogues, and because we know that they often happen. He then gives\r\nexamples of localities along the coast of France, as at Manche, where\r\nthere are ranges of high hills made up of limestones containing Gryphææ,\r\nammonites, and other deep-water shells.\r\n\r\nIn the conclusion of the chapter, after stating that the ocean has\r\nrepeatedly covered the greater part of the earth, he then claims that\r\n\"the displacement of the sea, producing a constantly variable\r\ninequality in the mass of the terrestrial radii, has necessarily caused\r\nthe earth's centre of gravity to vary, as also its two poles.[79]\r\nMoreover, since it appears that this variation, very irregular as it is,\r\nnot being subjected to any limits, it is very probable that each point\r\nof the surface of the planet we inhabit is really in the case of\r\nsuccessively finding itself subjected to different climates.\" He then\r\nexclaims in eloquent, profound, and impassioned language:\r\n\r\n  \"How curious it is to see that such suppositions receive their\r\n  confirmation from the consideration of the state of the earth's\r\n  surface and of its external crust, from that of the nature of\r\n  certain fossils found in abundance in the northern regions of the\r\n  earth, and whose analogues now live in warm climates; finally, in\r\n  that of the ancient astronomical observations of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, how great is the antiquity of the terrestrial globe, and how\r\n  small are the ideas of those who attribute to the existence of this\r\n  globe a duration of six thousand and some hundred years since its\r\n  origin down to our time!\r\n\r\n  \"The physico-naturalist and the geologist in this respect see things\r\n  very differently; for if they have given the matter the slightest\r\n  consideration--the one, the nature of fossils spread in such great\r\n  numbers in all the exposed parts of the globe, both in elevated\r\n  situations and at considerable depths in the earth; the other, the\r\n  number and disposition of the beds, as also the nature and order of\r\n  the materials which compose the external crust of this globe studied\r\n  throughout a great part of its thickness and in the mountain\r\n  masses--have they not had opportunities to convince themselves that\r\n  the antiquity of this same globe is so great that it is absolutely\r\n  beyond the power of man to appreciate it in an adequate way!\r\n\r\n  \"Assuredly our chronologies do not extend back very far, and they\r\n  could only have been made by propping them up by fables. Traditions,\r\n  both oral and written, become necessarily lost, and it is in the\r\n  nature of things that this should be so.\r\n\r\n  \"Even if the invention of printing had been more ancient than it is,\r\n  what would have resulted at the end of ten thousand years?\r\n  Everything changes, everything becomes modified, everything becomes\r\n  lost or destroyed. Every living language insensibly changes its\r\n  idiom; at the end of a thousand years the writings made in any\r\n  language can only be read with difficulty; after two thousand years\r\n  none of these writings will be understood. Besides wars, vandalism,\r\n  the greediness of tyrants and of those who guide religious opinions,\r\n  who always rely on the ignorance of the human race and are supported\r\n  by it, how many are the causes, as proved by history and the\r\n  sciences, of epochs after epochs of revolutions, which have more or\r\n  less completely destroyed them.\r\n\r\n  \"How many are the causes by which man loses all trace of that which\r\n  has existed, and cannot believe nor even conceive of the immense\r\n  antiquity of the earth he inhabits!\r\n\r\n  \"How great will yet seem this antiquity of the terrestrial globe in\r\n  the eyes of man when he shall form a just idea of the origin of\r\n  living bodies, as also of the causes of the development and of the\r\n  gradual process of perfection of the organization of these bodies,\r\n  and especially when it will be conceived that, time and favorable\r\n  circumstances having been necessary to give existence to all the\r\n  living species such as we actually see, he is himself the last\r\n  result and the actual maximum of this process of perfecting, the\r\n  limit (_terme_) of which, if it exists, cannot be known.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fourth chapter of the book there is less to interest the reader,\r\nsince the author mainly devotes it to a reiteration of the ideas of his\r\nearlier works on physics and chemistry. He claims that the minerals and\r\nrocks composing the earth's crust are all of organic origin, including\r\neven granite. The thickness of this crust he thinks, in the absence of\r\npositive knowledge, to be from three to four leagues, or from nine to\r\ntwelve miles.\r\n\r\nAfter describing the mode of formation of minerals, including agates,\r\nflint, geodes, etc., he discusses the process of fossilization by\r\nmolecular changes, silicious particles replacing the vegetable or animal\r\nmatter, as in the case of fossil wood.\r\n\r\nWhile, then, the products of animals such as corals and molluscs are\r\nlimestones, those of vegetables are humus and clay; and all of these\r\ndeposits losing their less fixed principles pass into a silicious\r\ncondition, and end by being reduced to quartz, which is the earthy\r\nelement in its purest form. The salts, pyrites, and metals only differ\r\nfrom other minerals by the different circumstances under which they were\r\naccumulated, in their different proportions, and in their much greater\r\namount of carbonic or acidific fire.\r\n\r\nRegarding granite, which, he says, naturalists very erroneously consider\r\nas _primitive_, he begins by observing that it is only by conjecture\r\nthat we should designate as primitive any matter whatever. He recognizes\r\nthe fact that granite forms the highest mountains, which are generally\r\narranged in more or less regular chains. But he strangely assumes that\r\nthe constituents of granite, _i.e._, felspar, quartz, and mica, did not\r\nexist before vegetables, and that these minerals and their aggregation\r\ninto granite were the result of slow deposition in the ocean.[80] He\r\ngoes so far as to assert that the porphyritic rocks were not thus formed\r\nin the sea, but that they are the result of deposits carried down by\r\nstreams, especially torrents flowing down from mountains. Gneiss, he\r\nthinks, resulted from the detritus of granitic rocks, by means of an\r\ninappreciable cement, and formed in a way analogous to that of the\r\nporphyries.\r\n\r\nThen he attacks the notion of Leibnitz of a liquid globe, in which all\r\nmineral substances were precipitated tumultuously, replacing this idea\r\nby his chemical notion of the origin of the crystalline and volcanic\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nHe is on firmer ground in explaining the origin of chalk and clay, for\r\nthe rocks of the region about Paris, with which he was familiar, are\r\nsedimentary and largely of organic origin.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Addition\" (pp. 173-188) following the fourth chapter Lamarck\r\nstates that, allowing for the variations in the intensity of the cause\r\nof elevation of the land as the result of the accumulations of organic\r\nmatter, he thinks he can, without great error, consider the mean rate as\r\n324 mm. (1 foot) a century. As a concrete example it has been observed,\r\nhe says, that one river valley has risen a foot higher in the space of\r\neleven years.\r\n\r\nPassing by his speculations on the displacement of the poles of the\r\nearth, and on the elevations of the equatorial regions, which will\r\ndispense with the necessity of considering the earth as originally in a\r\nliquid condition, he allows that \"the terrestrial globe is not at all a\r\nbody entirely and truly solid, but that it is a combination (_réunion_)\r\nof bodies more or less solid, displaceable in their mass or in their\r\nseparate parts, and among which there is a great number which undergo\r\ncontinual changes in condition.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, too early in the history of geology for Lamarck to\r\nseize hold of the fact, now so well known, that the highest mountain\r\nranges, as the Alps, Pyrenees, the Caucasus, Atlas ranges, and the\r\nMountains of the Moon (he does not mention the Himalayas) are the\r\nyoungest, and that the lowest mountains, especially those in the more\r\nnorthern parts of the continents, are but the roots or remains of what\r\nwere originally lofty mountain ranges. His idea, on the contrary, was,\r\nthat the high mountain chains above mentioned were the remains of\r\nancient equatorial elevations, which the fresh waters, for an enormous\r\nmultitude of ages, were in the process of progressively eroding and\r\nwearing down.\r\n\r\nWhat he says of the formation of coal is noteworthy:\r\n\r\n  \"Wherever there are masses of fossil wood buried in the earth, the\r\n  enormous subterranean beds of coal that are met with in different\r\n  countries, these are the witnesses of ancient encroachments of the\r\n  sea, over a country covered with forests; it has overturned them,\r\n  buried them in deposits of clay, and then after a time has\r\n  withdrawn.\"\r\n\r\nIn the appendix he briefly rehearses the laws of evolution as stated in\r\nhis opening lecture of his course given in the year IX. (1801), and\r\nwhich would be the subject of his projected work, _Biologie_, the third\r\nand last part of the Terrestrial Physics, a work which was not\r\npublished, but which was probably comprised in his _Philosophie\r\nzoologique_.\r\n\r\nThe _Hydrogéologie_ closes with a \"_Mémoire sur la matière du feu_\" and\r\none \"_sur la matière du son_,\" both being reprinted from the _Journal de\r\nPhysique_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] _Evolution in Biology_, in _Darwiniana_, New York, 1896, p. 212.\r\n\r\n[61] _Principles of Geology_.\r\n\r\n[62] Lyell's _Principles of Geology_, 8th edit., p. 22.\r\n\r\n[63] Quoted from Flourens' _Éloge Historique de Georges Cuvier_,\r\nHoefer's edition.

Thus he believes that the true factor\r\nin the deformation of the globe is vertical descent, and not, as Neumayr\r\nhad previously thought, the folding of the crust.\r\n\r\n[78] Bruguière (1750-1799), a conchologist of great merit. His\r\ndescriptions of new species were clear and precise. In his paper on the\r\ncoal mines of the mountains of Cevennes (Choix de Mémoires d'Hist. Nat.,\r\n1792) he made the first careful study of the coal formation in the\r\nCevennes, including its beds of coal, sandstone, and shale. A. de\r\nJussieu had previously supposed that the immense deposits of coal were\r\ndue to sudden cataclysms or to one of the great revolutions of the earth\r\nduring which the seas of the East or West Indies, having been driven as\r\nfar as into Europe, had deposited on its soil all these exotic plants to\r\nbe found there, after having torn them up on their way.\r\n\r\nBut Bruguière, who is to be reckoned among the early uniformitarians,\r\nsays that \"the capacity for observation is now too well-informed to be\r\ncontented with such a theory,\" and he explains the formation of coal\r\ndeposits in the following essentially modern way:\r\n\r\n\"The stores of coal, although formed of vegetable substances, owe their\r\norigin to the sea. It is when the places where we now find them were\r\ncovered by its waters that these prodigious masses of vegetable\r\nsubstances were gathered there, and this operation of nature, which\r\nastonishes the imagination, far from depending on any extraordinary\r\ncommotion of the globe, seems, on the contrary, to be only the result of\r\ntime, of an order of things now existing, and especially that of slow\r\nchanges\" (i, pp. 116, 117).\r\n\r\nThe proofs he brings forward are the horizontality of the beds, both of\r\ncoal and deposits between them, the marine shells in the sandstones, the\r\nfossil fishes intermingled with the plant remains in the shales;\r\nmoreover, some of the coal deposits are covered by beds of limestone\r\ncontaining marine shells which lived in the sea at a very great depth.\r\nThe alternation of these beds, the great mass of vegetable matter which\r\nlived at small distances from the soil which conceals them, and the\r\noccurrence of these beds so high up, show that at this time Europe was\r\nalmost wholly covered by the sea, the summits of the Alps and the\r\nPyrenees being then, as he says, so many small islands in the midst of\r\nthe ocean. He also intimates that the climate when these ferns (\"bamboo\"\r\nand \"banana\") lived was warmer than that of Europe at present.\r\n\r\nIn this essay, then, we see a great advance in correctness of geological\r\nobservation and reasoning over any previous writers, while its\r\nsuggestions were appreciated and adopted by Lamarck.\r\n\r\n[79] Hooke had previously, in order to explain the presence of tropical\r\nfossil shells in England, indulged in a variety of speculations\r\nconcerning changes in the position of the axis of the earth's rotation,\r\n\"a shifting of the earth's centre of gravity analogous to the\r\nrevolutions of the magnetic pole, etc.\" (Lyell's _Principles_). See also\r\np. 132.\r\n\r\n[80] Cuvier, in a footnote to his _Discours_ (sixth edition, p. 49), in\r\nreferring to this view, states that it originated with Rodig (_La\r\nPhysique_, p. 106, Leipzig, 1801) and De Maillet (_Telliamed_, tome ii.,\r\np. 169), \"also an infinity of new German works.\" He adds: \"M. de Lamarck\r\nhas recently expanded this system in France at great length in his\r\n_Hydrogéologie_ and in his _Philosophie zoologique_.\" Is the Rodig\r\nreferred to Ih. Chr. Rodig, author of _Beiträge zur Naturwissenschaft_\r\n(Leipzig, 1803. 8^o)? We have been unable to discover this view in De\r\nMaillet; Cuvier's reference to p. 169 is certainly incorrect, as quite a\r\ndifferent subject is there discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLAMARCK THE FOUNDER OF INVERTEBRATE PALÆONTOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for palæontology that the two greatest zoölogists of\r\nthe end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries,\r\nLamarck and Cuvier, lived in the Paris basin, a vast cemetery of corals,\r\nshells, and mammals; and not far from extensive deposits of cretaceous\r\nrocks packed with fossil invertebrates. With their then unrivalled\r\nknowledge of recent or existing forms, they could restore the\r\nassemblages of extinct animals which peopled the cretaceous ocean, and\r\nmore especially the tertiary seas and lakes.\r\n\r\nLamarck drew his supplies of tertiary shells from the tertiary beds\r\nsituated within a radius of from twenty-five to thirty miles from the\r\ncentre of Paris, and chiefly from the village of Grignon, about ten\r\nmiles west of Paris, beyond Versailles, and still a rich collecting\r\nground for the students of the Museum and Sorbonne. He acknowledges the\r\naid received from Defrance,[81] who had already collected at Grignon\r\nfive hundred species of fossil shells, three-fourths of which, he says,\r\nhad not then been described.\r\n\r\nLamarck's first essay (\"_Sur les fossiles_\") on fossils in general was\r\npublished at the end of his _Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres_\r\n(pp. 401-411), in 1801, a year before the publication of the\r\n_Hydrogéologie_. \"I give the name _fossils_,\" he says, \"to remains of\r\nliving beings, changed by their long sojourn in the earth or under\r\nwater, but whose forms and structure are still recognizable.\r\n\r\n  \"From this point of view, the bones of vertebrate animals and the\r\n  remains of testaceous molluscs, of certain crustacea, of many\r\n  echinoderms, coral polyps, when after having been for a long time\r\n  buried in the earth or hidden under the sea, will have undergone an\r\n  alteration which, while changing their substance, has nevertheless\r\n  destroyed neither their forms, their figures, nor the special\r\n  features of their structures.\"\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say that the animal parts having been destroyed, the shell\r\nremains, being composed of calcareous matter. This shell, then, has lost\r\nits lustre, its colors, and often even its nacre, if it had any; and in\r\nthis altered condition it is usually entirely white. In some cases where\r\nthe shells have remained for a long period buried in a mud of some\r\nparticular color, the shell receives the same color.\r\n\r\n  \"In France, the fossil shells of Courtagnon near Reims, Grignon near\r\n  Versailles, of what was formerly Touraine, etc., are almost all\r\n  still in this calcareous state, having more or less completely lost\r\n  their animal parts--namely, their lustre, their peculiar colors, and\r\n  their nacre.\r\n\r\n  \"Other fossils have undergone such an alteration that not only have\r\n  they lost their animal portion, but their substance has been changed\r\n  into a silicious matter. I give to this second kind of fossil the\r\n  name of _silicious fossils_, and examples of this kind are the\r\n  different oysters ('des ostracites'), many terebratulæ ('des\r\n  terebratulites'), trigoniæ, ammonites, echinites, encrinites, etc.\r\n\r\n  \"The fossils of which I have just spoken are in part buried in the\r\n  earth, and others lie scattered over its surface. They occur in all\r\n  the exposed parts of our globe, in the middle even of the largest\r\n  continents, and, what is very remarkable, they occur on mountains up\r\n  to very considerable altitudes. In many places the fossils buried in\r\n  the earth form banks extending several leagues in length.\"[82]\r\n\r\nConchologists, he says, did not care to collect or study fossil shells,\r\nbecause they had lost their lustre, colors, and beauty, and they were\r\nrejected from collections on this account as \"dead\" and uninteresting.\r\n\"But,\" he adds, \"since attention has been drawn to the fact that these\r\nfossils are extremely valuable _monuments_ for the study of the\r\nrevolutions which have taken place in different regions of the earth,\r\nand of the changes which the beings living there have themselves\r\nsuccessively undergone (in my lectures I have always insisted on these\r\nconsiderations), consequently the search for and study of fossils have\r\nexcited special interest, and are now the objects of the greatest\r\ninterest to naturalists.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck then combats the views of several naturalists, undoubtedly\r\nreferring to Cuvier, that the fossils are extinct species, and that the\r\nearth has passed through a general catastrophe (_un bouleversement\r\nuniversel_) with the result that a multitude of species of animals and\r\nplants were consequently absolutely lost or destroyed, and remarks in\r\nthe following telling and somewhat derisive language:\r\n\r\n  \"A universal catastrophe (_bouleversement_) which necessarily\r\n  regulates nothing, mixes up and disperses everything, is a very\r\n  convenient way to solve the problem for those naturalists who wish\r\n  to explain everything, and who do not take the trouble to observe\r\n  and investigate the course followed by nature as respects its\r\n  production and everything which constitutes its domain. I have\r\n  already elsewhere said what should be thought of this so-called\r\n  universal overturning of the globe; I return to fossils.\r\n\r\n  \"It is very true that, of the great quantity of fossil shells\r\n  gathered in the different countries of the earth, there are yet but\r\n  a very small number of species whose living or marine analogues are\r\n  known. Nevertheless, although this number may be very small, which\r\n  no one will deny, it is enough to suppress the universality\r\n  announced in the proposition cited above.\r\n\r\n  \"It is well to remark that among the fossil shells whose marine or\r\n  living analogues are not known, there are many which have a form\r\n  closely allied to shells of the same genera known to be now living\r\n  in the sea. However, they differ more or less, and cannot be\r\n  rigorously regarded as the same species as those known to be living,\r\n  since they do not perfectly resemble them. These are, it is said,\r\n  extinct species.\r\n\r\n  \"I am convinced that it is possible never to find, among fresh or\r\n  marine shells, any shells perfectly similar to the fossil shells of\r\n  which I have just spoken. I believe I know the reason; I proceed to\r\n  succinctly indicate, and I hope that it will then be seen, that\r\n  although many fossil shells are different from all the marine\r\n  shells known, this does not prove that the species of these shells\r\n  are extinct, but only that these species have changed as the result\r\n  of time, and that actually they have different forms from those\r\n  individuals whose fossil remains we have found.\"\r\n\r\nThen he goes on in the same strain as in the opening discourse, saying\r\nthat nothing terrestrial remains constant, that geological changes are\r\ncontinually occurring, and that these changes produce in living\r\norganisms a diversity of habits, a different mode of life, and as the\r\nresult modifications or developments in their organs and in the shape of\r\ntheir parts.\r\n\r\n  \"We should still realize that all the modifications which the\r\n  organism undergoes in its structure and form as the result of the\r\n  influence of circumstances which would influence this being, are\r\n  propagated by generation, and that after a long series of ages not\r\n  only will it be able to form new species, new genera, and even new\r\n  orders, but also each species will even necessarily vary in its\r\n  organization and in its forms.\r\n\r\n  \"We should not be more surprised then if, among the numerous fossils\r\n  which occur in all the dry parts of the globe and which offer us the\r\n  remains of so many animals which have formerly existed, there should\r\n  be found so few of which we know the living analogues. If there is\r\n  in this, on the contrary, anything which should astonish us, it is\r\n  to find that among these numerous fossil remains of beings which\r\n  have lived there should be known to us some whose analogues still\r\n  exist, from a germ to a vast multitude of living forms, of different\r\n  and ascending grades of perfection, ending in man.\r\n\r\n  \"This fact, as our collection of fossils proves, should lead us to\r\n  suppose that the fossil remains of the animals whose living\r\n  analogues we know are the less ancient fossils. The species to which\r\n  each of them belongs had doubtless not yet time to vary in any of\r\n  its forms.\r\n\r\n  \"We should, then, never expect to find among the living species the\r\n  totality of those that we meet with in the fossil state, and yet we\r\n  cannot conclude that any species can really be lost or extinct. It\r\n  is undoubtedly possible that among the largest animals some species\r\n  have been destroyed as a result of the multiplication of man in the\r\n  regions where they live. But this conjecture cannot be based on the\r\n  consideration of fossils alone; we can only form an opinion in this\r\n  respect when all the inhabited parts of the globe will have become\r\n  perfectly known.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck did not have, as we now have, a knowledge of the geological\r\nsuccession of organic forms. The comparatively full and detailed view\r\nwhich we possess of the different vast assemblages of plant and animal\r\nlife which have successively peopled the surface of our earth is a\r\nvision on which his eyes never rested. His slight, piecemeal glimpse of\r\nthe animal life of the Paris Basin, and of the few other extinct forms\r\nthen known, was all he had to depend upon or reason from. He was not\r\ndisposed to believe that the thread of life once begun in the earliest\r\ntimes could be arbitrarily broken by catastrophic means; that there was\r\nno relation whatever between the earlier and later faunas. He utterly\r\nopposed Cuvier's view that species once formed could ever be lost or\r\nbecome extinct without ancestors or descendants. He on the contrary\r\nbelieved that species underwent a slow modification, and that the fossil\r\nforms are the ancestors of the animals now living. Moreover, Lamarck was\r\nthe inventor of the first genealogical tree; his phylogeny, in the\r\nsecond volume of his _Philosophie zoologique_ (p. 463), proves that he\r\nrealized that the forms leading up to the existing ones were practically\r\nextinct, as we now use the word. Lamarck in theory was throughout, as\r\nHoussay well says, at one with us who are now living, but a century\r\nbehind us in knowledge of the facts needed to support his theory.\r\n\r\nIn this first published expression of his views on palæontology, we find\r\nthe following truths enumerated on which the science is based: (1) The\r\ngreat length of geological time; (2) The continuous existence of animal\r\nlife all through the different geological periods without sudden total\r\nextinctions and as sudden recreations of new assemblages; (3) The\r\nphysical environment remaining practically the same throughout in\r\ngeneral, but with (4) continual gradual but not catastrophic changes in\r\nthe relative distribution of land and sea and other modifications in the\r\nphysical geography, changes which (5) caused corresponding changes in\r\nthe habitat, and (6) consequently in the habits of the living beings; so\r\nthat there has been all through geological history a slow modification\r\nof life-forms.\r\n\r\nThus Lamarck's idea of creation is _evolutional_ rather than\r\n_uniformitarian_. There was, from his point of view, not simply a\r\nuniform march along a dead level, but a progression, a change from the\r\nlower or generalized to the higher or specialized--an evolution or\r\nunfolding of organic life. In his effort to disprove catastrophism he\r\nfailed to clearly see that species, as we style them, became extinct,\r\nthough really the changes in the species practically amounted to\r\nextinctions of the earlier species as such. The little that was known\r\nto Lamarck at the time he wrote, prevented his knowing that species\r\nbecame extinct, as we say, or recognizing the fact that while some\r\nspecies, genera, and even orders may rise, culminate, and die, others\r\nare modified, while a few persist from one period to another. He did,\r\nhowever, see clearly that, taking plant and animal life as a whole, it\r\nunderwent a slow modification, the later forms being the descendants of\r\nthe earlier; and this truth is the central one of modern palæontology.\r\n\r\nLamarck's first memoir on fossil shells, in which he described many new\r\nspecies, was published in 1802, after the appearance of his\r\n_Hydrogéologie_, to which he refers. It was the first of a series of\r\ndescriptive papers, which appeared at intervals from 1802 to 1806. He\r\ndoes not fail to open the series of memoirs with some general remarks,\r\nwhich prove his broad, philosophic spirit, that characterizing the\r\nfounder of a new science. He begins by saying that the fossil forms have\r\ntheir analogues in the tropical seas. He claims that there was evident\r\nproof that these molluscs could not have lived in a climate like that of\r\nplaces in which they now occur, instancing _Nautilius pompilius_, which\r\nnow lives in the seas of warm countries; also the presence of exotic\r\nferns, palms, fossil amber, fossil gum elastic, besides the occurrence\r\nof fossil crocodiles and elephants both in France and Germany.[83]\r\n\r\nHence there have been changes of climate since these forms flourished,\r\nand, he adds, the intervals between these changes of climate were\r\nstationary periods, whose duration was practically without limit. He\r\nassigns a duration to these stationary or intermediate periods of from\r\nthree to five million years each--\"a duration infinitely small relative\r\nto those required for all the changes of the earth's surface.\"\r\n\r\nHe refers in an appreciative way to the first special treatise on fossil\r\nshells ever published, that of an Englishman named Brander,[84] who\r\ncollected the shells \"out of the cliffs by the sea-coast between Christ\r\nChurch and Lymington, but more especially about the cliffs by the\r\nvillage of Hordwell,\" where the strata are filled with these fossils.\r\nLamarck, working upon collections of tertiary shells from Grignon and\r\nalso from Courtagnon near Reims, with the aid of Brander's work showed\r\nthat these beds, not known to be Eocene, extended into Hampshire,\r\nEngland; thus being the first to correlate by their fossils, though in a\r\nlimited way to be sure, the tertiary beds of France with those of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHow he at a later period (1805) regarded fossils and their relations to\r\ngeology may be seen in his later memoirs, _Sur les Fossiles des environs\r\nde Paris_.[85]\r\n\r\n  \"The determination of the characters, both generic and specific, of\r\n  animals of which we find the fossil remains in almost all the dry\r\n  parts of the continents and large islands of our globe will be, from\r\n  several points of view, a thing extremely useful to the progress of\r\n  natural history. At the outset, the more this determination is\r\n  advanced, the more will it tend to complete our knowledge in regard\r\n  to the species which exist in nature and of those which have\r\n  existed, as it is true that some of them have been lost, as we have\r\n  reason to believe, at least as concerns the large animals. Moreover,\r\n  this same determination will be singularly advantageous for the\r\n  advancement of geology; for the fossil remains in question may be\r\n  considered, from their nature, their condition, and their situation,\r\n  as authentic monuments of the revolutions which the surface of our\r\n  globe has undergone, and they can throw a strong light on the nature\r\n  and character of these revolutions.\"\r\n\r\nThis series of papers on the fossils of the Paris tertiary basin\r\nextended through the first eight volumes of the _Annales_, and were\r\ngathered into a volume published in 1806. In his descriptions his work\r\nwas comparative, the fossil species being compared with their living\r\nrepresentatives. The thirty plates, containing 483 figures representing\r\n184 species (exclusive of those figured by Brard), were afterwards\r\npublished, with the explanations, but not the descriptions, as a\r\nseparate volume in 1823.[86] This (the text published in 1806) is the\r\nfirst truly scientific palæontological work ever published, preceding\r\nCuvier's _Ossemens fossiles_ by six years.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider Lamarck's--at his time unrivalled--knowledge of\r\nmolluscs, his philosophical treatment of the relations of the study of\r\nfossils to geology, his correlation of the tertiary beds of England with\r\nthose of France, and his comparative descriptions of the fossil forms\r\nrepresented by the existing shells, it seems not unreasonable to regard\r\nhim as the founder of invertebrate palæontology, as Cuvier was of\r\nvertebrate or mammalian palæontology.\r\n\r\nWe have entered the claim that Lamarck was one of the chief founders of\r\npalæontology, and the first French author of a genuine, detailed\r\npalæontological treatise. It must be admitted, therefore, that the\r\nstatement generally made that Cuvier was the founder of this science\r\nshould be somewhat modified, though he may be regarded as the chief\r\nfounder of vertebrate palæontology.\r\n\r\nIn this field, however, Cuvier had his precursors not only in Germany\r\nand Holland, but also in France.\r\n\r\nOur information as to the history of the rise of vertebrate palæontology\r\nis taken from Blainville's posthumous work entitled _Cuvier et Geoffroy\r\nSaint-Hilaire_.[87] In this work, a severe critical and perhaps not\r\nalways sufficiently appreciative account of Cuvier's character and work,\r\nwe find an excellent history of the first beginnings of vertebrate\r\npalæontology. Blainville has little or nothing to say of the first steps\r\nin invertebrate palæontology, and, singularly enough, not a word of\r\nLamarck's principles and of his papers and works on fossil shells--a\r\nrather strange oversight, because he was a friend and admirer of\r\nLamarck, and succeeded him in one of the two departments of\r\ninvertebrates created at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle after Lamarck's\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBlainville, who by the way was the first to propose the word\r\n_palæontology_, shows that the study of the great extinct mammals had\r\nfor forty years been held in great esteem in Germany, before Faujas and\r\nCuvier took up the subject in France. Two Frenchmen, also before 1789,\r\nhad examined mammalian bones. Thus Bernard de Jussieu knew of the\r\nexistence in a fossil state of the teeth of the hippopotamus.\r\nGuettard[88] published in 1760 a memoir on the fossil bones of Aix en\r\nProvence. Lamanon (1780-1783)[89] in a beautiful memoir described a\r\nhead, almost entire, found in the gypsum beds of Paris. Daubenton had\r\nalso slightly anticipated Cuvier's law of correlation, giving \"a very\r\nremarkable example of the mode of procedure to follow in order to solve\r\nthese kinds of questions by the way in which he had recognized a bone of\r\na giraffe whose skeleton he did not possess\" (De Blainville).\r\n\r\n  \"But it was especially in Germany, in the hands of Pallas, Camper,\r\n  Blumenbach, anatomists and physicians, also those of Walch, Merck,\r\n  Hollmann, Esper, Rosenmüller, and Collini (who was not, however,\r\n  occupied with natural history), of Beckman, who had even discussed\r\n  the subject in a general way (_De reductione rerum fossilium ad\r\n  genera naturalia prototyporum--Nov. Comm. Soc. Scient.\r\n  Goettingensis_, t. ii.), that palæontology applied to quadrupeds had\r\n  already settled all that pertained to the largest species.\"\r\n\r\nAs early as 1764, Hollmann[90] had admirably identified the bones of a\r\nrhinoceros found in a bone-deposit of the Hartz, although he had no\r\nskeleton of this animal for comparison.\r\n\r\nPallas, in a series of memoirs dating from 1773, had discovered and\r\ndistinguished the species of Siberian elephant or mammoth, the\r\nrhinoceros, and the large species of oxen and buffalo whose bones were\r\nfound in such abundance in the quaternary deposits of Siberia; and, as\r\nBlainville says, if he did not distinguish the species, it was because\r\nat this epoch the question of the distinction of the two species of\r\nrhinoceros and of elephants, in the absence of material, could not be\r\nsolved. This solution, however, was made by the Dutch anatomist Camper,\r\nin 1777, who had brought together at Amsterdam a collection of skeletons\r\nand skulls of the existing species which enabled him for the first time\r\nto make the necessary comparisons between the extinct and living\r\nspecies. A few years later (1780) Blumenbach confirmed Camper's\r\nidentification, and gave the name of _Elephas primigenius_ to the\r\nSiberian mammoth.\r\n\r\n  \"Beckman\" [says Blainville] \"as early as 1772 had even published a\r\n  very good memoir on the way in which we should consider fossil\r\n  organic bodies; he was also the first to propose using the name\r\n  _fossilia_ instead of _petrefacta_, and to name the science which\r\n  studies fossils _Oryctology_. It was also he who admitted that these\r\n  bodies should be studied with reference to the class, order, genus,\r\n  species, as we would do with a living being, and he compared them,\r\n  which he called _prototypes_,[91] with their analogues. He then\r\n  passes in review, following the zoölogical order, the fossils which\r\n  had been discovered by naturalists. He even described one of them as\r\n  a new species, besides citing, with an erudition then rare, all the\r\n  authors and all the works where they were described. He did no more\r\n  than to indicate but not name each species. Thus he was the means of\r\n  soon producing a number of German authors who made little advance\r\n  from lack of anatomical knowledge; but afterwards the task fell into\r\n  the hands of men capable of giving to the newly created palæontology\r\n  a remarkable impulse, and one which since then has not abated.\"\r\n\r\nBlumenbach,[92] the most eminent and all-round German anatomist and\r\nphysiologist of his time, one of the founders of anthropology as well as\r\nof palæontology, had meanwhile established the fact that there were two\r\nspecies of fossil cave-bear, which he named _Ursus spelæus_ and _U.\r\narctoideus_. He began to publish his _Archæologia telluris_,[93] the\r\nfirst part of which appeared in 1803.\r\n\r\nFrom Blainville's useful summary we learn that Blumenbach, mainly\r\nlimiting his work to the fossils of Hanover, aimed at studying fossils\r\nin order to explain the revolutions of the earth.\r\n\r\n  \"Hence the order he proposed to follow was not that commonly\r\n  followed in treatises on oryctology, namely, systematic, following\r\n  the classes and the orders of the animal and vegetable kingdom, but\r\n  in a chronological order, in such a way as to show that the classes,\r\n  so far as it was possible to conjecture with any probability, were\r\n  established after or in consequence of the different revolutions of\r\n  the earth.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus, as we see, all the great questions, more or less insoluble,\r\n  which the study of fossil organic bodies can offer, were raised and\r\n  even discussed by the celebrated professor of Göttingen as early as\r\n  1803, before anything of the sort could have arisen from the essays\r\n  of M. G. Cuvier; the errors of distribution in the classes committed\r\n  by Blumenbach were due to the backward state of geology.\"\r\n\r\nThe political troubles of Germany, which also bore heavily upon the\r\nUniversity of Göttingen, probably brought Blumenbach's labors to an end,\r\nfor after a second \"specimen\" of his work, of less importance than the\r\nfirst, the _Archæologia telluris_ was discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe French geologist Faujas,[94] who also published several articles on\r\nfossil animals, ceased his labors, and now Cuvier began his memorable\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe field of the labors and triumphs of palæontology were now\r\ntransferred to France. We have seen that the year 1793, when Lamarck and\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire were appointed to fill the new zoölogical chairs,\r\nand the latter had in 1795 called Cuvier from Normandy to Paris, was a\r\ntime of renascence of the natural sciences in France. Cuvier began a\r\ncourse of lectures on comparative anatomy at the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory. He was more familiar than any one else in France with the\r\nprogress in natural science in Germany, and had felt the stimulus\r\narising from this source; besides, as Blainville stated, he was also\r\nimpelled by the questions boldly raised by Faujas in his geological\r\nlectures, who was somewhat of the school of Buffon. Cuvier, moreover,\r\nhad at his disposition the collection of skeletons of the Museum, which\r\nwas frequently increased by those of the animals which died in the\r\nmenagerie. With his knowledge of comparative anatomy, of which, after\r\nVicq-d'Azyr, he was the chief founder, and with the gypsum quarry of\r\nMontmartre, that rich cemetery of tertiary mammals, to draw from, he had\r\nthe whole field before him, and rapidly built up his own vast\r\nreputation and thus added to the glory of France.\r\n\r\nHis first contribution to palæontology[95] appeared in 1798, in which he\r\nannounced his intention of publishing an extended work on fossil bones\r\nof quadrupeds, to restore the skeletons and to compare them with those\r\nnow living, and to determine their relations and differences; but, says\r\nBlainville, in the list of thirty or forty species which he enumerates\r\nin his tableau, none was apparently discovered by him, unless it was the\r\nspecies of \"dog\" of Montmartre, which he afterward referred to his new\r\ngenera Palæotherium and Anaplotherium. In 1801 (le 26 brumaire, an IX.)\r\nhe published, by order of the Institut, the programme of a work on\r\nfossil quadrupeds, with an increased number of species; but, as\r\nBlainville states, \"It was not until 1804, and in tome iii. of the\r\n_Annales du Muséum_, namely, more than three years after his programme,\r\nthat he began his publications by fragments and without any order, while\r\nthese publications lasted more than eight years before they were\r\ncollected into a general work\"; this \"_corps d'ouvrage_\" being the\r\n_Ossemens fossiles_, which was issued in 1812 in four quarto volumes,\r\nwith an atlas of plates.\r\n\r\nIt is with much interest, then, that we turn to Cuvier's great work,\r\nwhich brought him such immediate and widespread fame, in order to see\r\nhow he treated his subject. His general views are contained in the\r\npreliminary remarks in his well-known \"Essay on the Theory of the Earth\"\r\n(1812), which was followed in 1821 by his _Discours sur les Révolutions\r\nde la Surface du Globe_.\r\n\r\nIt was written in a more attractive and vigorous style than the writings\r\nof Lamarck, more elegant, concise, and with less repetition, but it is\r\ndestitute of the philosophic grasp, and is not the work of a profound\r\nthinker, but rather of a man of talent who was an industrious collector\r\nand accurate describer of fossil bones, of a high order to be sure, but\r\nanalytical rather than synthetical, of one knowing well the value of\r\ncarefully ascertained and demonstrated facts, but too cautious, if he\r\nwas by nature able to do so, to speculate on what may have seemed to him\r\ntoo few facts. It is also the work of one who fell in with the current\r\nviews of the time as to the general bearing of his discoveries on\r\nphilosophy and theology, believing as he did in the universality of the\r\nNoachian deluge.\r\n\r\nLike Lamarck, Cuvier independently made use of the comparative method,\r\nthe foundation method in palæontology; and Cuvier's well-known \"law of\r\ncorrelation of structures,\" so well exemplified in the vertebrates, was\r\na fresh, new contribution to philosophical biology.\r\n\r\nIn his _Discours_, speaking of the difficulty of determining the bones\r\nof fossil quadrupeds, as compared with fossil shells or the remains of\r\nfishes, he remarks:[96]\r\n\r\n  \"Happily comparative anatomy possessed a principle which, well\r\n  developed, was capable of overcoming every difficulty; it was that\r\n  of the correlation of forms in organic beings, by means of which\r\n  each kind of organism can with exactitude be recognized by every\r\n  fragment of each of its parts.--Every organized being,\" he adds,\r\n  \"forms an entire system, unique and closed, whose organs mutually\r\n  correspond, and concur in the same definite action by a reciprocal\r\n  reaction. Hence none of these parts can change without the other\r\n  being also modified, and consequently each of them, taken\r\n  separately, indicates and produces (_donne_) all the others.\r\n\r\n  \"A claw, a shoulder-blade, a condyle, a leg or arm-bone, or any\r\n  other bone separately considered, enables us to discover the kind of\r\n  teeth to which they have belonged; so also reciprocally we may\r\n  determine the form of the other bones from the teeth. Thus,\r\n  commencing our investigation by a careful survey of any one bone by\r\n  itself, a person who is sufficiently master of the laws of organic\r\n  structure can reconstruct the entire animal. The smallest facet of\r\n  bone, the smallest apophysis, has a determinate character, relative\r\n  to the class, the order, the genus, and the species to which it\r\n  belongs, so that even when one has only the extremity of a\r\n  well-preserved bone, he can, with careful examination, assisted by\r\n  analogy and exact comparison, determine all these things as surely\r\n  as if he had before him the entire animal.\"\r\n\r\nCuvier adds that he has enjoyed every kind of advantage for such\r\ninvestigations owing to his fortunate situation in the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, and that by assiduous researches for nearly thirty years[97]\r\nhe has collected skeletons of all the genera and sub-genera of\r\nquadrupeds, with those of many species in certain genera, and several\r\nindividuals of certain species. With such means it was easy for him to\r\nmultiply his comparisons, and to verify in all their details the\r\napplications of his laws.\r\n\r\nSuch is the famous law of correlation of parts, of Cuvier. It could be\r\neasily understood by the layman, and its enunciation added vastly to the\r\npopular reputation and prestige of the young science of comparative\r\nanatomy.[98] In his time, and applied to the forms occurring in the\r\nParis Basin, it was a most valuable, ingenious, and yet obvious method,\r\nand even now is the principal rule the palæontologist follows in\r\nidentifying fragments of fossils of any class. But it has its\r\nlimitations, and it goes without saying that the more complete the\r\nfossil skeleton of a vertebrate, or the remains of an arthropod, the\r\nmore complete will be our conception of the form of the extinct\r\norganism. It may be misleading in the numerous cases of convergence and\r\nof generalized forms which now abound in our palæontological\r\ncollections. We can well understand how guarded one must be in working\r\nout the restorations of dinosaurs and fossil birds, of the Permian and\r\nTriassic theromorphs, and the Tertiary creodonts as compared with\r\nexisting carnivora.\r\n\r\nAs the late O. C. Marsh[99] observed:\r\n\r\n  \"We know to-day that unknown extinct animals cannot be restored from\r\n  a single tooth or claw unless they are very similar to forms already\r\n  known. Had Cuvier himself applied his methods to many forms from\r\n  the early tertiary or older formations he would have failed. If, for\r\n  instance, he had had before him the disconnected fragments of an\r\n  eocene tillodont he would undoubtedly have referred a molar tooth to\r\n  one of his pachyderms, an incisor tooth to a rodent, and a claw bone\r\n  to a carnivore. The tooth of a Hesperornis would have given him no\r\n  possible hint of the rest of the skeleton, nor its swimming feet the\r\n  slightest clue to the ostrich-like sternum or skull. And yet the\r\n  earnest belief in his own methods led Cuvier to some of his most\r\n  important discoveries.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now examine from Cuvier's own words in his _Discours_, not\r\nrelying on the statements of his expositors or followers, just what he\r\ntaught notwithstanding the clear utterances of his older colleague,\r\nLamarck, whose views he set aside and either ignored or ridiculed.[100]\r\n\r\n       ~       ~       ~       ~       ~\r\n\r\nHe at the outset affirms that nature has, like mankind, also had her\r\nintestine wars, and that \"the surface of the globe has been much\r\nconvulsed by successive revolutions and various catastrophes.\"\r\n\r\nAs first proof of the revolutions on the surface of the earth he\r\ninstances fossil shells, which in the lowest and most level parts of the\r\nearth are \"almost everywhere in such a perfect state of preservation\r\nthat even the smallest of them retain their most delicate parts, their\r\nsharpest ridges, and their finest and tenderest processes.\"\r\n\r\n  \"We are therefore forcibly led to believe not only that the sea has\r\n  at one period or another covered all our plains, but that it must\r\n  have remained there for a long time and in a state of tranquillity,\r\n  which circumstance was necessary for the formation of deposits so\r\n  extensive, so thick, in part so solid, and filled with the exuviæ of\r\n  aquatic animals.\"\r\n\r\nBut the traces of revolutions become still more marked when we ascend a\r\nlittle higher and approach nearer to the foot of the great mountain\r\nchains. Hence the strata are variously inclined, and at times vertical,\r\ncontain shells differing specifically from those of beds on the plains\r\nbelow, and are covered by horizontal later beds. Thus the sea, previous\r\nto the formation of the horizontal strata, had formed others, which by\r\nsome means have been broken, lifted up, and overturned in a thousand\r\nways. There had therefore been also at least one change in the basin of\r\nthat sea which preceded ours; it had also experienced at least one\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nHe then gives proofs that such revolutions have been numerous.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus the great catastrophes which have produced revolutions in the\r\n  basins of the sea were preceded, accompanied, and followed by\r\n  changes in the nature of the fluid and of the substances which it\r\n  held in solution, and when the surface of the seas came to be\r\n  divided by islands and projecting ridges, different changes took\r\n  place in every separate basin.\"\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Cuvierian doctrine _par excellence_, one in which he\r\nradically differs from Lamarck's views as to the genetic relations\r\nbetween the organisms of successive strata.\r\n\r\n  \"Amid these changes of the general fluid it must have been almost\r\n  impossible for the same kind of animals to continue to live, nor did\r\n  they do so in fact. Their species, and even their genera, change\r\n  with the strata, and although the same species occasionally recur at\r\n  small distances, it is generally the case that the shells of the\r\n  ancient strata have forms peculiar to themselves; that they\r\n  gradually disappear till they are not to be seen at all in the\r\n  recent strata, still less in the existing seas, in which, indeed, we\r\n  never discover their corresponding species, and where several even\r\n  of their genera are not to be found; that, on the contrary, the\r\n  shells of the recent strata resemble, as regards the genus, those\r\n  which still exist in the sea, and that in the last formed and\r\n  loosest of these strata there are some species which the eye of the\r\n  most expert naturalists cannot distinguish from those which at\r\n  present inhabit the ocean.\r\n\r\n  \"In animal nature, therefore, there has been a succession of changes\r\n  corresponding to those which have taken place in the chemical nature\r\n  of the fluid; and when the sea last receded from our continent its\r\n  inhabitants were not very different from those which it still\r\n  continues to support.\"\r\n\r\nHe then refers to successive irruptions and retreats of the sea, \"the\r\nfinal result of which, however, has been a universal depression of the\r\nlevel of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n  \"These repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea have neither been\r\n  slow nor gradual; most of the catastrophes which have occasioned\r\n  them have been sudden.\"\r\n\r\nHe then adds his proofs of the occurrence of revolutions before the\r\nexistence of living beings. Like Lamarck, Cuvier was a Wernerian, and in\r\nspeaking of the older or primitive crystalline rocks which contain no\r\nvestige of fossils, he accepted the view of the German theorist in\r\ngeology, that granites forming the axis of mountain chains were formed\r\nin a fluid.\r\n\r\nWe must give Cuvier the credit of fully appreciating the value of\r\nfossils as being what he calls \"historical documents,\" also for\r\nappreciating the fact that there were a number of revolutions marking\r\neither the incoming or end of a geological period; but as he failed to\r\nperceive the unity of organization in organic beings, and their genetic\r\nrelationship, as had been indicated by Lamarck and by Geoffroy\r\nSt. Hilaire, so in geological history he did not grasp, as did Lamarck,\r\nthe vast extent of geological time, and the general uninterrupted\r\ncontinuity of geological events. He was analytic, thoroughly believing\r\nin the importance of confining himself to the discovery of facts, and,\r\nconsidering the multitude of fantastic hypotheses and suggestions of\r\nprevious writers of the eighteenth century, this was sound, sensible,\r\nand thoroughly scientific. But unfortunately he did not stop here.\r\nMaster of facts concerning the fossil mammals of the Paris Basin, he\r\nalso--usually cautious and always a shrewd man of the world--fell into\r\nthe error of writing his \"theory of the world,\" and of going to the\r\nextreme length of imagining universal catastrophes where there are but\r\nlocal ones, a universal Noachian deluge when there was none, and of\r\nassuming that there were at successive periods thoroughgoing total and\r\nsudden extinctions of life, and as sudden recreations. Cuvier was a\r\nnatural leader of men, a ready debater, and a clear, forcible writer, a\r\nman of great executive force, but lacking in insight and imagination; he\r\ndominated scientific Paris and France, he was the law-giver and autocrat\r\nof the laboratories of Paris, and the views of quiet, thoughtful,\r\nprofound scholars such as Lamarck and Geoffroy St. Hilaire were\r\ndisdainfully pushed aside, overborne, and the progress of geological\r\nthought was arrested, while, owing to his great prestige, the rising\r\nviews of the Lamarckian school were nipped in the bud. Every one, after\r\nthe appearance of Cuvier's great work on fossil mammals and of his\r\n_Règne Animal_, was a Cuvierian, and down to the time of Lyell and of\r\nCharles Darwin all naturalists, with only here and there an exception,\r\nwere pronounced Cuvierians in biology and geology--catastrophists rather\r\nthan uniformitarians. We now, with the increase of knowledge of physical\r\nand historical geology, of the succession of life on the earth, of the\r\nunity of organization pervading that life from monad to man all through\r\nthe ages from the Precambrian to the present age, know that there were\r\nvast periods of preparation followed by crises, perhaps geologically\r\nbrief, when there were widespread changes in physical geography, which\r\nreacted on the life-forms, rendering certain ones extinct, and modifying\r\nothers; but this conception is entirely distinct from the views of\r\nCuvier and his school,[101] which may, in the light of our present\r\nknowledge, properly be deemed not only totally inadequate, but childish\r\nand fantastic.\r\n\r\nCuvier cites the view of Dolomieu, the well-known geologist and\r\nmineralogist (1770-1801), only, however, to reject it, who went to the\r\nextent of supposing that \"tides of seven or eight hundred fathoms have\r\ncarried off from time to time the bottom of the ocean, throwing it up in\r\nmountains and hills on the primitive valleys and plains of the\r\ncontinents\" (Dolomieu in _Journal de Physique_).\r\n\r\nCuvier met with objections to his extreme views. In his discourse he\r\nthus endeavors to answer \"the following objection\" which \"has already\r\nbeen stated against my conclusions\":\r\n\r\n  \"Why may not the non-existing races of mammiferous land quadrupeds\r\n  be mere modifications or varieties of those ancient races which we\r\n  now find in the fossil state, which modifications may have been\r\n  produced by change of climate and other local circumstances, and\r\n  since raised to the present excessive differences by the operation\r\n  of similar causes during a long succession of ages?\r\n\r\n  \"This objection may appear strong to those who believe in the\r\n  indefinite possibility of change of forms in organized bodies, and\r\n  think that during a succession of ages, and by alternations of\r\n  habits, all the species may change into each other, or one of them\r\n  give birth to all the rest. Yet to these persons the following\r\n  answer may be given from their own system: If the species have\r\n  changed by degrees, as they assume, we ought to find traces of this\r\n  gradual modification. Thus, between the Palæotherium and the species\r\n  of our own days, we should be able to discover some intermediate\r\n  forms; and yet no such discovery has ever been made. Since the\r\n  bowels of the earth have not preserved monuments of this strange\r\n  genealogy, we have a right to conclude that the ancient and now\r\n  extinct species were as permanent in their forms and characters as\r\n  those which exist at present; or, at least, that the catastrophe\r\n  which destroyed them did not have sufficient time for the production\r\n  of the changes that are alleged to have taken place.\"\r\n\r\nCuvier thus emphatically rejects all idea that any of the tertiary\r\nmammals could have been the ancestral forms of those now existing.\r\n\r\n  \"From all these well-established facts, there does not seem to be\r\n  the smallest foundation for supposing that the new genera which I\r\n  have discovered or established among extraneous fossils, such as the\r\n  _palæotherium_, _anaplotherium_, _megalonynx_, _mastodon_,\r\n  _pterodactylis_, etc., have ever been the sources of any of our\r\n  present animals, which only differ as far as they are influenced by\r\n  time or climate. Even if it should prove true, which I am far from\r\n  believing to be the case, that the fossil elephants, rhinoceroses,\r\n  elks, and bears do not differ further from the present existing\r\n  species of the same genera than the present races of dogs differ\r\n  among themselves, this would by no means be a sufficient reason to\r\n  conclude that they were of the same species; since the races or\r\n  varieties of dogs have been influenced by the trammels of\r\n  domestication, which these other animals never did and indeed never\r\n  could experience.\"[102]\r\n\r\nThe extreme views of Cuvier as to the frequent renewal and extinction of\r\nlife were afterward (in 1850) carried out to an exaggerated extent by\r\nD'Orbigny, who maintained that the life of the earth must have become\r\nextinct and again renewed twenty-seven times. Similar views were held by\r\nAgassiz, who, however, maintained the geological succession of animals\r\nand the parallelism between their embryonic development and geological\r\nsuccession, the two foundation stones of the biogenetic law of Haeckel.\r\nBut immediately after the publication of Cuvier's _Ossemens fossiles_,\r\nas early as 1813, Von Schlotheim, the founder of vegetable palæontology,\r\nrefused to admit that each set of beds was the result of such a\r\nthoroughgoing revolution.[103]\r\n\r\nAt a later date Bronn \"demonstrated that certain species indeed really\r\npassed from one formation to another, and though stratigraphic\r\nboundaries are often barriers confining the persistence of some form,\r\nstill this is not an absolute rule, since the species in nowise appear\r\nin their entirety.\"[104] At present the persistence of genera like\r\nSaccamina, Lingula, Ceratodus, etc., from one age to another, or even\r\nthrough two or more geological ages, is well known, while _Atrypa\r\nreticulatus_, a species of world-wide distribution, lived from near the\r\nbeginning of the Upper Silurian to the Waverly or beginning of the\r\nCarboniferous age.\r\n\r\nSuch were the views of the distinguished founder of vertebrate\r\npalæontology. When we compare the _Hydrogéologie_ of Lamarck with\r\nCuvier's _Discours_, we see, though some erroneous views, some very\r\nfantastic conceptions are held, in common with others of his time, in\r\nregard to changes of level of the land and the origin of the crystalline\r\nrocks, that it did contain the principles upon which modern palæontology\r\nis founded, while those of Cuvier are now in the limbo--so densely\r\npopulated--of exploded, ill-founded theories.\r\n\r\nOur claim that Lamarck should share with Cuvier the honor of being a\r\nfounder of palæontology[105] is substantiated by the philosophic Lyell,\r\nwho as early as 1836, in his _Principles of Geology_, expresses the same\r\nview in the following words: \"The labors of Cuvier in comparative\r\nosteology, and of Lamarck in recent and fossil shells, had raised these\r\ndepartments of study to a rank of which they had never previously been\r\ndeemed susceptible.\"\r\n\r\nOur distinguished American palæontologist, the late O. C. Marsh, takes\r\nthe same view, and draws the following parallel between the two great\r\nFrench naturalists:\r\n\r\n  \"In looking back from this point of view, the philosophical breadth\r\n  of Lamarck's conclusions, in comparison with those of Cuvier, is\r\n  clearly evident. The invertebrates on which Lamarck worked offered\r\n  less striking evidence of change than the various animals\r\n  investigated by Cuvier; yet they led Lamarck directly to evolution,\r\n  while Cuvier ignored what was before him on this point, and rejected\r\n  the proof offered by others. Both pursued the same methods, and had\r\n  an abundance of material on which to work, yet the facts observed\r\n  induced Cuvier to believe in catastrophes, and Lamarck in the\r\n  uniform course of nature. Cuvier declared species to be permanent;\r\n  Lamarck, that they were descended from others. Both men stand in the\r\n  first rank in science; but Lamarck was the prophetic genius, half a\r\n  century in advance of his time.\"[106]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[81] Although Defrance (born 1759, died in 1850) aided Lamarck in\r\ncollecting tertiary shells, his earliest palæontological paper (on\r\nHipponyx) did not appear until the year 1819.\r\n\r\n[82] In a footnote Lamarck refers to an unpublished work, which probably\r\nformed a part of the _Hydrogéologie_, published in the following year.\r\n\"_Voyez à ce sujet mon ouvrage intitulé: De l'influence du mouvement des\r\neaus sur la surface du globe terrestre, et des indices du déplacement\r\ncontinuel du bassin des mers, ainsi que de son transport successif sur\r\nles différens points de la surface du globe_\" (no date).\r\n\r\n[83] It should be stated that the first observer to inaugurate the\r\ncomparative method was that remarkable forerunner of modern\r\npalæontologists, Steno the Dane, who was for a while a professor at\r\nPadua. In 1669, in his treatise entitled _De Solido intra Solidum\r\nnaturaliter contento_, which Lyell translates \"On gems, crystals, and\r\norganic petrefactions inclosed within solid rocks,\" he showed, by\r\ndissecting a shark from the Mediterranean, that certain fossil teeth\r\nfound in Tuscany were also those of some shark. \"He had also compared\r\nthe shells discovered in the Italian strata with living species, pointed\r\nout their resemblance, and traced the various gradations from shells\r\nmerely calcined, or which had only lost their animal gluten, to those\r\npetrefactions in which there was a perfect substitution of stony matter\"\r\n(Lyell's _Principles_, p. 25). About twenty years afterwards, the\r\nEnglish philosopher Robert Hooke, in a discourse on earthquakes, written\r\nin 1688, but published posthumously in 1705, was aware that the fossil\r\nammonites, nautili, and many other shells and fossil skeletons found in\r\nEngland, were of different species from any then known; but he doubted\r\nwhether the species had become extinct, observing that the knowledge of\r\nnaturalists of all the marine species, especially those inhabiting the\r\ndeep sea, was very deficient. In some parts of his writings, however, he\r\nleans to the opinion that species had been lost. Some species, he\r\nobserves with great sagacity, \"are _peculiar to certain places_, and not\r\nto be found elsewhere.\" Turtles and such large ammonites as are found in\r\nPortland seem to have been the productions of hotter countries, and he\r\nthought that England once lay under the sea within the torrid zone\r\n(Lyell's _Principles_).\r\n\r\nGesner the botanist, of Zurich, also published in 1758 an excellent\r\ntreatise on petrefactions and the changes of the earth which they\r\ntestify. He observed that some fossils, \"such as ammonites, gryphites,\r\nbelemnites, and other shells, are either of unknown species or found\r\nonly in the Indian and other distant seas\" (Lyell's _Principles_).\r\n\r\nGeikie estimates very highly Guettard's labors in palæontology, saying\r\nthat \"his descriptions and excellent drawings entitle him to rank as the\r\nfirst great leader of the palæontological school of France.\" He\r\npublished many long and elaborate memoirs containing brief descriptions,\r\nbut without specific names, and figured some hundreds of fossil shells.\r\nHe was the first to recognize trilobites (Illænus) in the Silurian\r\nslates of Angers, in a memoir published in 1762. Some of his generic\r\nnames, says Geikie, \"have passed into the languages of modern\r\npalæontology,\" and one of the genera of chalk sponges which he\r\ndescribed has been named after him, _Guettardia_. In his memoir \"On the\r\naccidents that have befallen fossil shells compared with those which are\r\nfound to happen to shells now living in the sea\" (Trans. Acad. Roy.\r\nSciences, 1765, pp. 189, 329, 399) he shows that the beds of fossil\r\nshells on the land present the closest possible analogy to the flow of\r\nthe present sea, so that it becomes impossible to doubt that the\r\naccidents, such as broken and worn shells, which have affected the\r\nfossil organisms, arose from precisely the same causes as those of\r\nexactly the same nature that still befall their successors on the\r\nexisting ocean bottom. On the other hand, Geikie observes that it must\r\nbe acknowledged \"that Guettard does not seem to have had any clear ideas\r\nof the sequence of formations and of geological structures.\"\r\n\r\n[84] Scheuchzer's \"Complaint and Vindication of the Fishes\" (_Piscium\r\nQuerelae et Vindiciae_, Germany, 1708), \"a work of zoölogical merit, in\r\nwhich he gave some good plates and descriptions of fossil fish\" (Lyell).\r\nGesner's treatise on petrefactions preceded Lamarck's work in this\r\ndirection, as did Brander's _Fossillia Hantoniensia_, published in 1766,\r\nwhich contained \"excellent figures of fossil shells from the more modern\r\n(or Eocene) marine strata of Hampshire.

It does not differ materially\r\nfrom the first edition of the _Essay on the Theory of the Earth_,\r\ntranslated by Jameson, and republished in New York, with additions by\r\nSamuel L. Mitchell, in 1818.\r\n\r\n[97] In the first edition of the _Théorie_ he says fifteen years,\r\nwriting in 1812. In the later edition he changed the number of years to\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\n[98] De Blainville is inclined to make light of Cuvier's law and of his\r\nassumptions; and in his somewhat cynical, depreciatory way, says:\r\n\r\n\"Thus for the thirty years during which appeared the works of M. G.\r\nCuvier on fossil bones, under the most favorable circumstances, in a\r\nkind of renascence of the science of organization of animals, then\r\nalmost effaced in France, aided by the richest osteological collections\r\nwhich then existed in Europe, M. G. Cuvier passed an active and a\r\ncomparatively long life, in a region abounding in fossil bones, without\r\nhaving established any other principle in osteology than a witticism\r\nwhich he had been unable for a moment to take seriously himself, because\r\nhe had not yet investigated or sufficiently studied the science of\r\norganization, which I even doubt, to speak frankly, if he ever did.\r\nOtherwise, he would himself soon have perceived the falsity of his\r\nassertion that a single facet of a bone was sufficient to reconstruct a\r\nskeleton from the observation that everything is harmoniously correlated\r\nin an animal. It is a great thing if the memory, aided by a strong\r\nimagination, can thus pass from a bone to the entire skeleton, even in\r\nan animal well known and studied even to satiety; but for an unknown\r\nanimal, there is no one except a man but slightly acquainted with the\r\nanatomy of animals who could pretend to do it. It is not true anatomists\r\nlike Hunter, Camper, Pallas, Vicq-d'Azyr, Blumenbach, Soemmering, and\r\nMeckel who would be so presuming, and M. G. Cuvier would have been\r\nhimself much embarrassed if he had been taken at his word, and besides\r\nit is this assertion which will remain formulated in the mouths of the\r\nignorant, and which has already made many persons believe that it is\r\npossible to answer the most difficult and often insoluble problems in\r\npalæontology, without having made any preliminary study, with the aid of\r\ndividers, and, on the other hand, discouraging the Blumenbachs and\r\nSoemmerings from giving their attention to this kind of work.\"\r\n\r\nHuxley has, _inter alia_, put the case in a somewhat similar way, to\r\nshow that the law should at least be applied with much caution to\r\nunknown forms:\r\n\r\n\"Cuvier, in the _Discours sur les Révolutions de la Surface du Globe_,\r\nstrangely credits himself, and has ever since been credited by others,\r\nwith the invention of a new method of palæontological research. But if\r\nyou will turn to the _Recherches sur les Ossemens fossiles_, and watch\r\nCuvier not speculating, but working, you will find that his method is\r\nneither more nor less than that of Steno. If he was able to make his\r\nfamous prophecy from the jaw which lay upon the surface of a block of\r\nstone to the pelvis which lay hidden in it, it was not because either he\r\nor any one else knew, or knows, why a certain form of jaw is, as a rule,\r\nconstantly accompanied by the presence of marsupial bones, but simply\r\nbecause experience has shown that these two structures are coördinated\"\r\n(_Science and Hebrew Tradition. Rise and Progress of Paleontology_ 1881,\r\np. 23).\r\n\r\n[99] _History and Methods of Paleontological Discovery_ (1879).\r\n\r\n[100] The following statement of Cuvier's views is taken from Jameson's\r\ntranslation of the first _Essay on the Theory of the Earth_, \"which\r\nformed the introduction to his _Recherches sur les Ossemens fossiles_,\"\r\nthe first edition of which appeared in 1812, or ten years after the\r\npublication of the _Hydrogéologie_. The original I have not seen, but I\r\nhave compared Jameson's translation with the sixth edition of the\r\n_Discours_ (1820).\r\n\r\n[101] Cuvier, in speaking of these revolutions, \"which have changed the\r\nsurface of our earth,\" correctly reasons that they must have excited a\r\nmore powerful action upon terrestrial quadrupeds than upon marine\r\nanimals. \"As these revolutions,\" he says, \"have consisted chiefly in\r\nchanges of the bed of the sea, and as the waters must have destroyed all\r\nthe quadrupeds which they reached if their irruption over the land was\r\ngeneral, they must have destroyed the entire class, or, if confined only\r\nto certain continents at one time, they must have destroyed at least all\r\nthe species inhabiting these continents, without having the same effect\r\nupon the marine animals. On the other hand, millions of aquatic animals\r\nmay have been left quite dry, or buried in newly formed strata or thrown\r\nviolently on the coasts, while their races may have been still preserved\r\nin more peaceful parts of the sea, whence they might again propagate and\r\nspread after the agitation of the water had ceased.\"\r\n\r\n[102] _Discours_, etc. Sixth edition.\r\n\r\n[103] Felix Bernard, _The Principles of Paleontology_, Paris, 1895,\r\ntranslated by C. E. Brooks, edited by J. M. Clark, from 14th Annual\r\nReport New York State Geologist, 1895, pp. 127-217 (p. 16). Bernard\r\ngives no reference to the work in which Schlotheim expressed this\r\nopinion. E. v. Schlotheim's first work, _Flora der Vorwelt_, appeared in\r\n1804, entitled _Beschreibung merkwürdiger Kraüterabdrücke und\r\nPflanzenversteinerungen.

München, 1819). He was followed in Germany by\r\nSternberg (_Versuch einer geognostischbotanischen Darstellung der Flora\r\nder Vorvelt._ 1-8. 1811. Leipzig, 1820-38); and in France by A. T.\r\nBrongniart, 1801-1876 (_Histoire des Végétaux fossiles_, 1828). These\r\nwere the pioneers in palæophytology.\r\n\r\n[104] Bernard's _History and Methods of Paleontological Discovery_\r\n(1879), p. 23.\r\n\r\n[105] In his valuable and comprehensive _Geschichte der Geologie und\r\nPaläontologie_ (1899), Prof. K. von Zittel, while referring to Lamarck's\r\nworks on the tertiary shells of Paris and his _Animaux sans Vertèbres_,\r\nalso giving a just and full account of his life, practically gives him\r\nthe credit of being one of the founders of invertebrate palæontology. He\r\nspeaks of him as \"the reformer and founder of scientific conchology,\"\r\nand states that \"he defined with wonderful acuteness the numerous genera\r\nand species of invertebrate animals, and created thereby for the ten\r\nyears following an authoritative foundation.\" Zittel, however, does not\r\nmention the _Hydrogéologie_. Probably so rare a book was overlooked by\r\nthe eminent German palæontologist.\r\n\r\n[106] _History and Methods of Paleontological Discovery_ (1879), p. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nLAMARCK'S OPINIONS ON GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nLamarck died before the rise of the sciences of morphology, embryology,\r\nand cytology. As to palæontology, which he aided in founding, he had but\r\nthe slightest idea of the geological succession of life-forms, and not\r\nan inkling of the biogenetic law or recapitulation theory. Little did he\r\nknow or foresee that the main and strongest support of his own theory\r\nwas to be this same science of the extinct forms of life. Yet it is a\r\nmatter of interest to know what were his views or opinions on the nature\r\nof life; whether he made any suggestions bearing on the doctrine of the\r\nunity of nature; whether he was a vitalist or not; and whether he was a\r\nfollower of Haller and of Bonnet,[107] as was Cuvier, or pronounced in\r\nfavor of epigenesis.\r\n\r\nWe know that he was a firm believer in spontaneous generation, and that\r\nhe conceived that it took place not only in the origination of his\r\nprimeval germs or _ébauches_, but at all later periods down to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nYet Lamarck accepted Harvey's doctrine, published in 1651, that all\r\nliving beings arose from germs or eggs.[108]\r\n\r\nHe must have known of Spallanzani's experiments, published in 1776, even\r\nif he had not read the writings of Treviranus (1802-1805), both of whom\r\nhad experimentally disproved the theory of the spontaneous generation of\r\nanimalcules in putrid infusions, showing that the lowest organisms\r\ndevelop only from germs.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century, though one of great intellectual activity, was,\r\nhowever, as regards cosmology, geology, general physiology or biology, a\r\nperiod of groping in the dim twilight, when the whole truth or even a\r\npart of it was beyond the reach of the greatest geniuses, and they could\r\nonly seize on half-truths. Lamarck, both a practical botanist,\r\nsystematic zoölogist, and synthetic philosopher, had done his best work\r\nbefore the rise of the experimental and inductive methods, when direct\r\nobservation and experiments had begun to take the place of vague _à\r\npriori_ thinking and reasoning, so that he labored under a disadvantage\r\ndue largely to the age in which he lived.\r\n\r\nOnly the closing years of the century witnessed the rise of the\r\nexperimental methods in physics and chemistry, owing to the brilliant\r\nwork of Priestley and of Lavoisier. The foundations of general\r\nphysiology had been laid by Haller,[109] those of embryology to a\r\npartial extent by Wolff,[110] Von Baer's work not appearing until 1829,\r\nthe year in which Lamarck died.\r\n\r\n_Spontaneous Generation._--Lamarck's views on spontaneous generation are\r\nstated in his _Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps vivans_ (1802).\r\nHe begins by referring to his statement in a previous work[111] that\r\nlife may be suspended for a time and then go on again.\r\n\r\n  \"Here I would remark it (life) can be produced (_préparée_) both by\r\n  an organic act and by nature herself, without any act of this kind,\r\n  in such a way that certain bodies without possessing life can be\r\n  prepared to receive it, by an impression _which indicates in these\r\n  bodies the first traces of organization_.\"\r\n\r\nWe will not enter upon an exposition of his views on the nature of\r\nsexual generation and of fecundation, the character of his _vapeur\r\nsubtile_ (_aura vitalis_) which he supposes to take an active part in\r\nthe act of fertilization, because the notion is quite as objectionable\r\nas that of the vital force which he rejects. He goes on to say, however,\r\nthat we cannot penetrate farther into the wonderful mystery of\r\nfecundation, but the opinions he expresses lead to the view that\r\n\"nature herself imitates her procedures in fecundation in another state\r\nof things, without having need of the union or of the products of any\r\npreëxistent organization.\"\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to observe that in the places where his _aura vitalis_, or\r\nsubtle fluid, is very abundant, as in hot climates or in heated periods,\r\nand especially in humid places, life seems to originate and to multiply\r\nitself everywhere and with a singular rapidity.\r\n\r\n  \"In this high temperature the higher animals and mankind develop and\r\n  mature more rapidly, and diseases run their courses more swiftly;\r\n  while on the other hand these conditions are more favorable to the\r\n  simpler forms of life, for the reason that in them the orgasm and\r\n  irritability are entirely dependent on external influences, and all\r\n  plants are in the same case, because heat, moisture, and light\r\n  complete the conditions necessary to their existence.\r\n\r\n  \"Because heat is so advantageous to the simplest animals, let us\r\n  examine whether there is not occasion for believing that it can\r\n  itself form, with the concourse of favorable circumstances, the\r\n  first germs of animal life.\r\n\r\n  \"_Nature necessarily forms generations, spontaneous or direct, at\r\n  the extremity of each organic kingdom or where the simplest organic\r\n  bodies occur._\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition, he allows, is so far removed from the view generally\r\nheld, that it will be for a long time, and perhaps always, regarded as\r\none of the errors of the human mind.\r\n\r\n  \"I do not,\" he adds, \"ask any one to accord it the least confidence\r\n  on my word alone. But as surely it will happen, sooner or later,\r\n  that men on the one hand independent of prejudices even the most\r\n  widespread, and on the other profound observers of nature, may have\r\n  a glimpse of this truth, I am very content that we should know that\r\n  it is of the number of those views which, in spite of the prejudices\r\n  of my age, I have thought it well to accept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" he asks, \"should not heat and electricity act on certain matters\r\nunder favorable conditions and circumstances?\" He quotes Lavoisier as\r\nsaying (_Chémie_, i., p. 202) \"that God in creating light had spread\r\nover the world the principle of organization of feeling and of thought\";\r\nand Lamarck suggests that heat, \"this mother of generation, this\r\nmaterial soul of organized bodies,\" may be the chief one of the means\r\nwhich nature directly employs to produce in the appropriate kind of\r\nmatter an act of arrangement of parts, of a primitive germ of\r\norganization, and consequently of vitalization analogous to sexual\r\nfecundation.\r\n\r\n  \"Not only the direct formation of the simplest living beings could\r\n  have taken place, as I shall attempt to demonstrate, but the\r\n  following considerations prove that it is necessary that such\r\n  germ-formations should be effected and be repeated under favorable\r\n  conditions, without which the state of things which we observe could\r\n  neither exist nor subsist.\"\r\n\r\nHis argument is that in the lower polyps (the Protozoa) there is no\r\nsexual reproduction, no eggs. But they perish (as he strangely thought,\r\nwithout apparently attempting to verify his belief) in the winter. How,\r\nhe asks, can they reappear? Is it not more likely that these simple\r\norganisms are themselves regenerated? After much verbiage and\r\nrepetition, he concludes:\r\n\r\n  \"We may conceive that the simplest organisms can arise from a minute\r\n  mass of substances which possess the following conditions--namely,\r\n  which will have solid parts in a state nearest the fluid conditions,\r\n  consequently having the greatest suppleness and only sufficient\r\n  consistence to be susceptible of constituting the parts contained in\r\n  it. Such is the condition of the most gelatinous organized bodies.\r\n\r\n  \"Through such a mass of substances the subtile and expansive fluids\r\n  spread, and, always in motion in the milieu environing it,\r\n  unceasingly penetrate it and likewise dissipate it, arranging while\r\n  traversing this mass the internal disposition of its parts, and\r\n  rendering it suitable to continually absorb and to exhale the other\r\n  environing fluids which are able to penetrate into its interior, and\r\n  which are susceptible of being contained.\r\n\r\n  \"These other fluids, which are water charged with dissolved\r\n  (_dissous_) gas, or with other tenuous substances, the atmospheric\r\n  air, which contains water, etc., I call containable fluids, to\r\n  distinguish them from subtile fluids, such as caloric, electricity,\r\n  etc., which no known bodies are believed to contain.\r\n\r\n  \"The containable fluids absorbed by the small gelatinous mass in\r\n  question remain almost motionless in its different parts, because\r\n  the non-containable subtile fluids which always penetrate there do\r\n  not permit it.\r\n\r\n  \"In this way the uncontainable fluids at first mark out the first\r\n  traces of the simplest organization, and consequently the\r\n  containable fluids by their movements and their other influences\r\n  develop it, and with time and all the favorable circumstances\r\n  complete it.\"\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a sufficiently vague and unsatisfactory theory of\r\nspontaneous generation. This sort of guess-work and hypothetical\r\nreasoning is not entirely confined to Lamarck's time. Have we not, even\r\na century later, examples among some of our biologists, and very eminent\r\nones, of whole volumes of _à priori_ theorizing and reasoning, with\r\nscarcely a single new fact to serve as a foundation? And yet this is an\r\nage of laboratories, of experimentations and of trained observers. The\r\nbest of us indulge in far-fetched hypotheses, such as pangenesis,\r\npanmixia, the existence of determinants, and if this be so should we not\r\nexcuse Lamarck, who gave so many years to close observation in\r\nsystematic botany and zoölogy, for his flights into the empyrean of\r\nsubtle fluids, containable and uncontainable, and for his invocation of\r\nan _aura vitalis_, at a time when the world of demonstrated facts in\r\nmodern biology was undiscovered and its existence unsuspected?\r\n\r\n_The Preëxistence of Germs and the Encasement Theory._--Lamarck did not\r\nbelieve in Bonnet's idea of the \"preëxistence of germs.\" He asks whether\r\nthere is any foundation for the notion that germs \"successively develop\r\nin generations, _i.e._ in the multiplication of individuals for the\r\npreservation of species,\" and says:\r\n\r\n  \"I am not inclined to believe it if this preëxistence is taken in a\r\n  general sense; but in limiting it to individuals in which the\r\n  unfertilized embryos or germs are formed before generation. I then\r\n  believe that it has some foundation.--They say with good reason,\" he\r\n  adds, \"that every living being originates from an egg.... But the\r\n  eggs being the envelope of every kind of germ, they preëxist in the\r\n  individuals which produce them, before fertilization has vivified\r\n  them. The seeds of plants (which are vegetable eggs) actually exist\r\n  in the ovaries of flowers before the fertilization of these\r\n  ovaries.\"[112]\r\n\r\nFrom whom did he get this idea that seeds or eggs are envelopes of all\r\nsorts of germs? It is not the \"evolution\" of a single germ, as, for\r\nexample, an excessively minute but complete chick in the hen's egg, in\r\nthe sense held by Bonnet. Who it was he does not mention. He evidently,\r\nhowever, had the Swiss biologist in mind, who held that all living\r\nthings proceed from preëxisting germs.[113]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been his views as to the germs in the egg before\r\nfertilization, we take it that he believed in the epigenetic development\r\nof the plant or animal after the seed or egg was once fertilized.[114]\r\n\r\nLamarck did not adopt the encasement theory of Swammerdam and of Heller.\r\nWe find nothing in Lamarck's writings opposed to epigenesis. The\r\nfollowing passage, which bears on this subject, is translated from his\r\n_Mémoires de Physique_ (p. 250), where he contrasts the growth of\r\norganic bodies with that of minerals.\r\n\r\n  \"The body of this living being not having been formed by\r\n  _juxtaposition_, as most mineral substances, that is to say, by the\r\n  external and successive apposition of particles aggregated _en\r\n  masse_ by attraction, but essentially formed by generation, in its\r\n  principle, it has then grown by intussusception--namely, by the\r\n  introduction, the transportation, and the internal apposition of\r\n  molecules borne along and deposited between its parts; whence have\r\n  resulted the successive developments of parts which compose the body\r\n  of this living individual, and from which afterwards also result the\r\n  repairs which preserve it during a limited time.\"\r\n\r\nHere, as elsewhere in his various works, Lamarck brings out the fact,\r\nfor the first time stated, that all material things are either\r\nnon-living or mineral, inorganic; or living, organic. A favorite phrase\r\nwith him is living bodies, or, as we should say, organisms. He also is\r\nthe first one to show that minerals increase by juxtaposition, while\r\norganisms grow by intussusception.\r\n\r\nNo one would look in his writings for an idea or suggestion of the\r\nprinciple of differentiation of parts or organs as we now understand it,\r\nor for the idea of the physiological division of labor; these were\r\nreserved for the later periods of embryology and morphology.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the First Vital Function._--We will now return to the germ.\r\nAfter it had begun spontaneous existence, Lamarck proceeds to say:\r\n\r\n  \"Before the containable fluids absorbed by the small, jelly-like\r\n  mass in question have been expelled by the new portions of the same\r\n  fluids which reach there, they can then deposit certain of the\r\n  contained fluids they carry along, and the movements of the\r\n  contained fluids may apply these substances to the containing parts\r\n  of the newly organized microscopic being. In this way originates the\r\n  first of the vital functions which becomes established in the\r\n  simplest organism, _i.e._, nutrition. The environing containable\r\n  fluids are, then, for the living body of very great simplicity, a\r\n  veritable chyle entirely prepared by nature.\r\n\r\n  \"Mutilation cannot operate without gradually increasing the\r\n  consistence of the parts contained within the minute new organism\r\n  and without extending its dimensions. Hence soon arose the second of\r\n  the vital functions, _growth or internal development_.\"\r\n\r\n_First Faculty of Animal Nature._--Then gradually as the continuity of\r\nthis state of things within the same minute living mass in question\r\nincreases the consistence of its parts enclosed within and extends its\r\ndimensions, a vital orgasm, at first very feeble, but becoming\r\nprogressively more intense, is formed in these enclosed parts and\r\nrenders them susceptible of _reaction_ against the slight impression of\r\nthe fluids in motion which they contain, and at the same time renders\r\nthem capable of contraction and of distention. Hence the origin of\r\n_animal irritability_ and the basis of feeling, which is developed\r\nwherever a nervous fluid, susceptible of locating the effects in one of\r\nseveral special centres, can be formed.\r\n\r\n  \"Scarcely will the living corpuscle, newly animalized, have received\r\n  any increase in consistence and in dimensions of the parts\r\n  contained, when, as the result of the organic movement which it\r\n  enjoys, it will be subjected to successive changes and losses of its\r\n  substance.\r\n\r\n  \"It will then be obliged to take nourishment not only to obtain any\r\n  development whatever, but also to preserve its individual existence,\r\n  because it is necessary that it repair its losses under penalty of\r\n  its destruction.\r\n\r\n  \"But as the individual in question has not yet any special organ for\r\n  nutrition, it therefore absorbs by the pores of its internal surface\r\n  the substance adapted for its nourishment. Thus the first mode of\r\n  taking food in a living body so simple can be no other than by\r\n  absorption or a sort of suction, which is accomplished by the pores\r\n  of its outer surface.\r\n\r\n  \"This is not all; up to the present time the animalized corpuscle we\r\n  are considering is still only a primitive animalcule because it as\r\n  yet has no special organ. Let us see then how nature will come to\r\n  furnish it with any primitive special organ, and what will be the\r\n  organ that nature will form before any others, and which in the\r\n  simplest animal is the only one constantly found; this is the\r\n  alimentary canal, the principal organ of digestion common to all\r\n  except colpodes, vibrios, proteus (amoeba), volvoces, monads, etc.\r\n\r\n  \"This digestive canal is,\" he says--proceeding with his _à priori_\r\n  morphology--\"a little different from that of this day, produced by\r\n  contractions of the body, which are stronger in one part of the body\r\n  than in another, until a little crease is produced on the surface of\r\n  the body. This furrow or crease will receive the food. Insensibly\r\n  this little furrow by the habit of being filled, and by the so\r\n  frequent use of its pores, will gradually increase in depth; it will\r\n  soon assume the form of a pouch or of a tubular cavity with porous\r\n  walls, a blind sac, or with but a single opening. Behold the\r\n  primitive alimentary canal created by nature, the simplest organ of\r\n  digestion.\"\r\n\r\nIn like _à priori_ manner he describes the creation of the faculty of\r\nreproduction. The next organ, he says, is that of reproduction due to\r\nthe regenerative faculty. He describes fission and budding. Finally\r\n(p. 122) he says:\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, we perceive that if the first germs of living bodies are\r\n  all formed in one day in such great abundance and facility under\r\n  favorable circumstances, they ought to be, nevertheless, by reason\r\n  of the antiquity of the causes which make them exist, the most\r\n  ancient organisms in nature.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1794 he rejected the view once held of a continuous chain of being,\r\nthe _échelle des êtres_ suggested by Locke and by Leibnitz, and more\r\nfully elaborated by Bonnet, from the inorganic to the organic worlds,\r\nfrom minerals to plants, from plants to polyps (our Infusoria), polyps\r\nto worms, and so on to the higher animals. He, on the contrary, affirms\r\nthat nature makes leaps, that there is a wide gap between minerals and\r\nliving bodies, that everything is not gradated and shaded into each\r\nother. One reason for this was possibly his strange view, expressed in\r\n1794, that all brute bodies and inorganic matters, even granite, were\r\nnot formed at the same epoch but at different times, and were derived\r\nfrom organisms.[115]\r\n\r\nThe mystical doctrine of a vital force was rife in Lamarck's time. The\r\nchief starting point of the doctrine was due to Haller, and, as Verworn\r\nstates, it is a doctrine which has confused all physiology down to the\r\nmiddle of the present century, and even now emerges again here and there\r\nin varied form.[116]\r\n\r\nLamarck was not a vitalist. Life, he says,[117] is usually supposed to\r\nbe a particular being or entity; a sort of principle whose nature is\r\nunknown, and which possesses living bodies. This notion he denies as\r\nabsurd, saying that life is a very natural phenomenon, a physical fact;\r\nin truth a little complicated in its principles, but not in any sense a\r\nparticular or special being or entity.\r\n\r\nHe then defines life in the following words: \"Life is an order and a\r\nstate of things in the parts of every body possessing it, which permits\r\nor renders possible in it the execution of organic movement, and which,\r\nso long as it exists, is effectively opposed to death. Derange this\r\norder and this state of things to the point of preventing the execution\r\nof organic movement, or the possibility of its reëstablishment, then you\r\ncause death.\" Afterwards, in the _Philosophie zoologique_, he modifies\r\nthis definition, which reads thus: \"Life, in the parts of a body which\r\npossesses it, is an order and a state of things which permit organic\r\nmovements; and these movements, which constitute active life, result\r\nfrom the action of a stimulating cause which excites them.\"[118]\r\n\r\nFor the science of all living bodies Lamarck proposed the word\r\n\"Biology,\" which is so convenient a term at the present day. The word\r\nfirst appears in the preface to the _Hydrogéologie_, published in 1802.\r\nIt is worthy of note that in the same year the same word was proposed\r\nfor the same science by G. R. Treviranus as the title of a work,\r\n_Biologie, der Philosophie der lebenden Natur_, published in 1802-1805\r\n(vols. i.-vi., 1802-1822), the first volume appearing in 1802.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the _Philosophie zoologique_ he considers the\r\nphysical causes of life, and in the introduction he defines nature as\r\nthe _ensemble_ of objects which comprise: (1) All existing physical\r\nbodies; (2) the general and special laws which regulate the changes of\r\ncondition and situation of these bodies; (3) finally, the movement\r\neverywhere going on among them resulting in the wonderful order of\r\nthings in nature.\r\n\r\nTo regard nature as eternal, and consequently as having existed from all\r\ntime, is baseless and unreasonable. He prefers to think that nature is\r\nonly a result, \"whence, I suppose, and am glad to admit, a first cause,\r\nin a word, a supreme power which has given existence to nature, which\r\nhas made it as a whole what it is.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the source of life in bodies endowed with it, he considers it a\r\nproblem more difficult than to determine the course of the stars in\r\nspace, or the size, masses, and movements of the planets belonging to\r\nour solar system; but, however formidable the problem, the difficulties\r\nare not insurmountable, as the phenomena are purely physical--_i.e._,\r\nessentially resulting from acts of organization.\r\n\r\nAfter defining life, in the third chapter (beginning vol. ii.) he treats\r\nof the exciting cause of organic movements. This exciting cause is\r\nforeign to the body which it vivifies, and does not perish, like the\r\nlatter. \"This cause resides in invisible, subtile, expansive,\r\never-active fluids which penetrate or are incessantly developed in the\r\nbodies which they animate.\" These subtile fluids we should in these days\r\nregard as the physico-chemical agents, such as heat, light, electricity.\r\n\r\nWhat he says in the next two chapters as to the \"orgasme\" and\r\nirritability excited by the before-mentioned exciting cause may be\r\nregarded as a crude foreshadowing of the primary properties of\r\nprotoplasm, now regarded as the physical basis of life--_i.e._,\r\ncontractility, irritability, and metabolism. In Chapter VI. Lamarck\r\ndiscusses direct or spontaneous generation in the same way as in 1802.\r\nIn the following paragraph we have foreshadowed the characteristic\r\nqualities of the primeval protoplasmic matter fitted to receive the\r\nfirst traces of organization and life:\r\n\r\n  \"Every mass of substance homogeneous in appearance, of a gelatinous\r\n  or mucilaginous consistence, whose parts, coherent among themselves,\r\n  will be in the state nearest fluidity, but will have only a\r\n  consistence sufficient to constitute containing parts, will be the\r\n  body most fitted to receive the first traces of organization and\r\n  life.\"\r\n\r\nIn the third part of the _Philosophie zoologique_ Lamarck considers the\r\nphysical causes of feeling--_i.e._, those which form the productive\r\nforce of actions, and those giving rise to intelligent acts. After\r\ndescribing the nervous system and its functions, he discusses the\r\nnervous fluid. His physiological views are based on those of Richerand's\r\n_Physiologie_, which he at times quotes.\r\n\r\nLamarck's thoughts on the nature of the nervous fluid (_Recherches sur\r\nle fluide nerveux_) are curious and illustrative of the gropings after\r\nthe truth of his age.\r\n\r\nHe claims that the supposed nervous fluid has much analogy to the\r\nelectric, that it is the _feu éthéré_ \"animalized by the circumstances\r\nunder which it occurs.\" In his _Recherches sur l'organisation des corps\r\nvivans_ (1802) he states that, as the result of changes continually\r\nundergone by the principal fluids of an animal, there is continually set\r\nfree in a state of _feu fixé_ a special fluid, which at the instant of\r\nits disengagement occurs in the expansive state of the caloric, then\r\nbecomes gradually rarefied, and insensibly arrives at the state of an\r\nextremely subtile fluid which then passes along the smallest nervous\r\nramifications in the substance of the nerve, which is a very good\r\nconductor for it. On its side the brain sends back the subtile fluid in\r\nquestion along the nerves to the different organs.\r\n\r\nIn the same work (1802) Lamarck defines thought as a physical act taking\r\nplace in the brain. \"This act of thinking gives rise to different\r\ndisplacements of the subtile nervous fluid and to different\r\naccumulations of this fluid in the parts of the brain where the ideas\r\nhave been traced.\" There result from the flow of the fluid on the\r\nconserved impressions of ideas, special movements which portions of this\r\nfluid acquire with each impression, which give rise to compounds by\r\ntheir union producing new impressions on the delicate organ which\r\nreceives them, and which constitute abstract ideas of all kinds, also\r\nthe different acts of thought.\r\n\r\nAll the acts which constitute thought are the comparisons of ideas, both\r\nsimple and complex, and the results of these comparisons are judgments.\r\n\r\nHe then discusses the influence of the nervous fluid on the muscles, and\r\nalso its influence considered as the cause of feeling (_sentiment_).\r\nFinally he concludes that _feu fixé_, caloric, the nervous fluid, and\r\nthe electric fluid \"are only one and the same substance occurring in\r\ndifferent states.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[107] Charles Bonnet (1720-1793), a Swiss naturalist, is famous for his\r\nwork on Aphides and their parthenogenetic generation, on the mode of\r\nreproduction in the Polyzoa, and on the respiration of insects. After\r\nthe age of thirty-four, when his eyesight became impaired, he began his\r\npremature speculations, which did not add to his reputation. Judging,\r\nhowever, by an extract from his writings by D'Archiac (_Introduction à\r\nl'Étude de la Paléontologie stratigraphique_, ii., p. 49), he had sound\r\nideas on the theory of descent, claiming that \"la diversité et la\r\nmultitude des conjunctions, peut-être même la diversité des climats et\r\ndes nourritures, ont donné naissance à de nouvelles espèces ou à des\r\nindividus intermédiaires\" (_Oeuvres d'Hist. nat. et de Philosophie_,\r\nin-8vo, p. 230, 1779).\r\n\r\n[108] See his remark: \"_On a dit avec raison que tout ce qui a vie\r\nprovient d'un auf_\" (_Mémoires de Physique_, etc., 1797, p. 272). He\r\nappears, however, to have made the simplest organisms exceptions to this\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\n[109] _Elementa physiologiae corporis humani_, iv.

The ideas of Bonnet on germs are stated in his\r\n_Mémoires sur les Salamandres_ (1777-78-80) and in his _Considérations\r\nsur les corps organisés_ (1762.)\r\n\r\n[115] _Mémoires de Physique_, etc., pp. 318, 319, 324-359. Yet the idea\r\nof a sort of continuity between the inorganic and the organic world is\r\nexpressed by Verworn.\r\n\r\n[116] _General Physiology_ (English trans., 1899, p. 17). In France\r\nvitalism was founded by Bordeu (1722-1766), developed further by Barthez\r\n(1734-1806) and Chaussier (1746-1828), and formulated most distinctly by\r\nLouis Dumas (1765-1813). Later vitalists gave it a thoroughly mystical\r\naspect, distinguishing several varieties, such as the _nisus formativus_\r\nor formative effort, to explain the forms of organisms, accounting for\r\nthe fact that from the egg of a bird, a bird and no other species always\r\ndevelops (_l. c._, p. 18).\r\n\r\n[117] _Recherches sur l'organisation des corps vivans_ (1802), p. 70.\r\nThe same view was expressed in _Mémoires de physique_ (1797),\r\npp. 254-257, 386.\r\n\r\n[118] Here might be quoted for comparison other famous definitions of\r\nlife:\r\n\r\n\"Life is the sum of the functions by which death is resisted.\"--Bichat.\r\n\r\n\"Life is the result of organization.\"--(?)\r\n\r\n\"Life is the principle of individuation.\"--Coleridge ex.

Lamarck\r\nhimself frankly stated in his address to the Committee of Public\r\nInstruction of the National Convention that the study of plants had been\r\nfor a century neglected by Frenchmen, and that the great progress which\r\nit had made during this time was almost entirely due to foreigners.\r\n\r\n  \"I am free to say that since the distinguished Tournefort the French\r\n  have remained to some extent inactive in this direction; they have\r\n  produced almost nothing, unless we except some fragmentary mediocre\r\n  or unimportant works. On the other hand, Linné in Sweden, Dilwillen\r\n  in England, Haller in Switzerland, Jacquin in Austria, etc., have\r\n  immortalized themselves by their own works, vastly extending the\r\n  limit of our knowledge in this interesting part of natural history.\"\r\n\r\nWhat led young Lamarck to take up botanical studies, his botanical\r\nrambles about Paris, and his longer journeys in different parts of\r\nFrance and in other countries, his six years of unremitting labor on his\r\n_Flore Française_, and the immediate fame it brought him, culminating in\r\nhis election as a member of the French Academy, have been already\r\nrecounted.\r\n\r\nLamarck was thirty-four when his _Flore Française_ appeared. It was not\r\npreceded, as in the case of most botanical works, by any preliminary\r\npapers containing descriptions of new or unknown species, and the three\r\nstout octavo volumes appeared together at the same date.\r\n\r\nThe first volume opens with a report on the work made by MM. Duhamel and\r\nGuettard. Then follows the _Discours Préliminaire_, comprising over a\r\nhundred pages, while the main body of the work opens with the _Principes\r\nÉlémentaires de Botanique_, occupying 223 pages. The work was a general\r\nelementary botany and written in French. Before this time botanists had\r\ndeparted from the artificial system of Linné, though it was convenient\r\nfor amateurs in naming their plants. Jussieu had proposed his system of\r\nnatural families, founded on a scientific basis, but naturally more\r\ndifficult for the use of beginners. To obviate the matter Lamarck\r\nconceived and proposed the dichotomic method for the easy determination\r\nof species. No new species were described, and the work, written in the\r\nvernacular, was simply a guide to the indigenous plants of France,\r\nbeginning with the cryptogams and ending with the flowering plants. A\r\nsecond edition appeared in 1780, and a third, edited and remodelled by\r\nA. P. De Candolle, and forming six volumes, appeared in 1805-1815. This\r\nwas until within a comparatively few years the standard French botany.\r\n\r\nSoon after the publication of his _Flore Française_ he projected two\r\nother works which gave him a still higher position among botanists. His\r\n_Dictionnaire de Botanique_ was published in 1783-1817, forming eight\r\nvolumes and five supplementary ones. The first two and part of the third\r\nvolume were written by Lamarck, the remainder by other botanists, who\r\ncompleted it after Lamarck had abandoned botanical studies and taken up\r\nhis zoölogical work. His second great undertaking was _L'Illustration\r\ndes Genres_ (1791-1800), with a supplement by Poiret (1823).\r\n\r\nCuvier speaks thus of these works:\r\n\r\n  \"_L'Illustration des Genres_ is a work especially fitted to enable\r\n  one to acquire readily an almost complete idea of this beautiful\r\n  science. The precision of the descriptions and of the definitions of\r\n  Linnæus is maintained, as in the institutions of Tournefort, with\r\n  figures adapted to give body to these abstractions, and to appeal\r\n  both to the eye and to the mind, and not only are the flowers and\r\n  fruits represented, but often the entire plant. More than two\r\n  thousand genera are thus made available for study in a thousand\r\n  plates in quarto, and at the same time the abridged characters of a\r\n  vast number of species are given.\r\n\r\n  \"The _Dictionnaire_ contains more details of the history with\r\n  careful descriptions, critical researches on their synonymy, and\r\n  many interesting observations on their uses or on special points of\r\n  their organizations. The matter is not all original in either of the\r\n  works, far from it, but the choice of figures is skilfully made, the\r\n  descriptions are drawn from the best authors, and there are a large\r\n  number which relate to species and also some genera previously\r\n  unknown.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck himself says that after the publication of his _Flore\r\nFrançaise_, his zeal for work increasing, and after travelling by order\r\nof the government in different parts of Europe, he undertook on a vast\r\nscale a general work on botany.\r\n\r\n  \"This work comprised two distinct features. In the first (_Le\r\n  Dictionnaire_), which made a part of the new encyclopedia, the\r\n  citizen Lamarck treats of philosophical botany, also giving the\r\n  complete description of all the genera and species known. An immense\r\n  work from the labor it cost, and truly original in its execution....\r\n  The second treatise, entitled _Illustration des Genres_, presents in\r\n  the order of the sexual system the figures and the details of all\r\n  the genera known in botany, and with a concise exposition of the\r\n  generic characters and of the species known. This work, unique of\r\n  its kind, already contains six hundred plates executed by the best\r\n  artists, and will comprise nine hundred. Also for more than ten\r\n  years the citizen Lamarck has employed in Paris a great number of\r\n  artists. Moreover, he has kept running three separate presses for\r\n  different works, all relating to natural history.\"\r\n\r\nCuvier in his _Éloge_ also adds:\r\n\r\n  \"It is astonishing that M. de Lamarck, who hitherto had been\r\n  studying botany as an amateur, was able so rapidly to qualify\r\n  himself to produce so extensive a work, in which the rarest plants\r\n  were described. It is because, from the moment he undertook it, with\r\n  all the enthusiasm of his nature, he collected them from the gardens\r\n  and examined them in all the available herbaria; passing the days at\r\n  the houses of the botanists he knew, but chiefly at the home of M.\r\n  de Jussieu, in that home where for more than a century a scientific\r\n  hospitality welcomed with equal kindness every one who was\r\n  interested in the delightful study of botany. When any one reached\r\n  Paris with plants he might be sure that the first one who should\r\n  visit him would be M. de Lamarck; this eager interest was the means\r\n  of his receiving one of the most valuable presents he could have\r\n  desired. The celebrated traveller Sonnerat, having returned in 1781\r\n  for the second time from the Indies, with very rich collections of\r\n  natural history, imagined that every one who cultivated this science\r\n  would flock to him; it was not at Pondichéry or in the Moluccas that\r\n  he had conceived an idea of the vortex which too often in this\r\n  capital draws the savants as well as men of the world; no one came\r\n  but M. de Lamarck, and Sonnerat, in his chagrin, gave him the\r\n  magnificent collection of plants which he had brought. He profited\r\n  also by that of Commerson, and by those which had been accumulated\r\n  by M. de Jussieu, and which were generously opened to him.\"\r\n\r\nThese works were evidently planned and carried out on a broad and\r\ncomprehensive scale, with originality of treatment, and they were most\r\nuseful and widely used. Lamarck's original special botanical papers were\r\nnumerous. They were mostly descriptive of new species and genera, but\r\nsome were much broader in scope and were published over a period of ten\r\nyears, from 1784 to 1794, and appeared in the _Journal d'Histoire\r\nnaturelle_, which he founded, and in the _Mémoires_ of the Academy of\r\nSciences.\r\n\r\nHe discussed the shape or aspect of the plants characteristic of certain\r\ncountries, while his last botanical effort was on the sensibility of\r\nplants (1798).\r\n\r\nAlthough not in the front rank of botanists, compared with Linné,\r\nJussieu, De Candolle, and others, yet during the twenty-six years of his\r\nbotanical career it may safely be said that Lamarck gave an immense\r\nimpetus to botany in France, and fully earned the title of \"the French\r\nLinné.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck not only described a number of genera and species of plants, but\r\nhe attempted a general classification, as Cleland states:\r\n\r\n  \"In 1785 (_Hist. de l'Acad._) he evinced his appreciation of the\r\n  necessity of natural orders in botany by an attempt at the\r\n  classification of plants, interesting though crude, and falling\r\n  immeasurably short of the system which grew in the hands of his\r\n  intimate friend Jussieu.\"--_Encyc. Brit._, Art. LAMARCK.\r\n\r\nA genus of tropical plants of the group _Solanaceæ_ was named _Markea_\r\nby Richard, in honor of Lamarck, but changed by Persoon and Poiret to\r\n_Lamarckea_. The name _Lamarckia_ of Moench and Koeler was proposed for\r\na genus of grasses; it is now _Chrysurus_.\r\n\r\nLamarck's success as a botanist led to more or less intimate relations\r\nwith Buffon. But it appears that the good-will of this great naturalist\r\nand courtier for the rising botanist was not wholly disinterested.\r\nLamarck owed the humble and poorly paid position of keeper of the\r\nherbarium to Buffon. Bourguin adds, however:\r\n\r\n  \"_Mais il les dut moins à ses mérites qu'aux petits passions de la\r\n  science officielle._ The illustrious Buffon, who was at the same\r\n  time a very great lord at court, was jealous of Linné. He could not\r\n  endure having any one compare his brilliant and eloquent\r\n  word-pictures of animals with the cold and methodical descriptions\r\n  of the celebrated Swedish naturalist. So he attempted to combat him\r\n  in another field--botany. For this reason he encouraged and pushed\r\n  Lamarck into notice, who, as the popularizer of the system of\r\n  classification into natural families, seemed to him to oppose the\r\n  development of the arrangement of Linné.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck's style was never a highly finished one, and his incipient\r\nessays seemed faulty to Buffon, who took so much pains to write all his\r\nworks in elegant and pure French. So he begged the Abbé Haüy to review\r\nthe literary form of Lamarck's works.\r\n\r\nHere it might be said that Lamarck's is the philosophic style; often\r\nanimated, clear, and pure, it at times, however, becomes prolix and\r\ntedious, owing to occasional repetition.\r\n\r\nBut after all it can easily be understood that the discipline of his\r\nbotanical studies, the friendship manifested for him by Buffon, then so\r\ninfluential and popular, the relations Lamarck had with Jussieu, Haüy,\r\nand the zoölogists of the Jardin du Roi, were all important factors in\r\nLamarck's success in life, a success not without terrible drawbacks, and\r\nto the full fruition of which he did not in his own life attain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLAMARCK THE ZOÖLOGIST\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there has been and still may be a difference of opinion as to\r\nthe value and permanency of Lamarck's theoretical views, there has never\r\nbeen any lack of appreciation of his labors as a systematic zoölogist.\r\nHe was undoubtedly the greatest zoölogist of his time. Lamarck is the\r\none dominant personage who in the domain of zoölogy filled the interval\r\nbetween Linné and Cuvier, and in acuteness and sound judgment he at\r\ntimes surpassed Cuvier. His was the master mind of the period of\r\nsystematic zoölogy, which began with Linné--the period which, in the\r\nhistory of zoölogy, preceded that of comparative anatomy and morphology.\r\n\r\nAfter Aristotle, no epoch-making zoölogist arose until Linné was born.\r\nIn England Linné was preceded by Ray, but binomial nomenclature and the\r\nfirst genuine attempt at the classification of animals dates back to the\r\n_Systema Naturæ_ of Linné, the tenth edition of which appeared in 1758.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF LAMARCK]\r\n\r\nThe contemporaries of Lamarck in biological science, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, were Camper (1722-89), Spallanzani (1729-99), Wolff (1733-94),\r\nHunter (1728-93), Bichat (1771-1802), and Vicq d'Azyr (1748-94). These\r\nwere all anatomists and physiologists, the last-named being the first\r\nto propose and use the term \"comparative anatomy,\" while Bichat was the\r\nfounder of histology and pathological anatomy. There was in fact no\r\nprominent systematic zoölogist in the interval between Linné and\r\nLamarck. In France there were only two zoölogists of prominence when\r\nLamarck assumed his duties at the Museum. These were Bruguière the\r\nconchologist and Olivier the entomologist. In Germany Hermann was the\r\nleading systematic zoölogist. We would not forget the labors of the\r\ngreat German anatomist and physiologist Blumenbach, who was also the\r\nfounder of anthropology; nor the German anatomists Tiedemann, Bojanus,\r\nand Carus; nor the embryologist Döllinger. But Lamarck's method and\r\npoint of view were of a new order--he was much more than a mere\r\nsystematist. His work in systematic zoölogy, unlike that of Linné, and\r\nespecially of Cuvier, was that of a far higher grade. Lamarck, besides\r\nhis rigid, analytical, thorough, and comprehensive work on the\r\ninvertebrates, whereby he evolved order and system out of the chaotic\r\nmass of forms comprised in the Insects and Vermes of Linné, was animated\r\nwith conceptions and theories to which his forerunners and\r\ncontemporaries, Geoffroy St. Hilaire excepted, were entire strangers.\r\nHis tabular view of the classes of the animal kingdom was to his mind a\r\ngenealogical tree; his idea of the animal kingdom anticipated and was\r\nakin to that of our day. He compares the animal series to a tree with\r\nits numerous branches, rather than to a single chain of being. This\r\nseries, as he expressly states, began with the monad and ended with\r\nman; it began with the simple and ended with the complex, or, as we\r\nshould now say, it proceeded from the generalized or undifferentiated to\r\nthe specialized and differentiated. He perceived that many forms had\r\nbeen subjected to what he calls degeneration, or, as we say,\r\nmodification, and that the progress from the simple to the complex was\r\nby no means direct. Moreover, fossil animals were, according to his\r\nviews, practically extinct species, and stood in the light of being the\r\nancestors of the members of our existing fauna. In fact, his views,\r\nnotwithstanding shortcomings and errors in classification naturally due\r\nto the limited knowledge of anatomy and development of his time, have\r\nbeen at the end of a century entirely confirmed--a striking testimony to\r\nhis profound insight, sound judgment, and philosophic breadth.\r\n\r\nThe reforms that he brought about in the classification of the\r\ninvertebrate animals were direct and positive improvements, were adopted\r\nby Cuvier in his _Règne animal_, and have never been set aside. We owe\r\nto him the foundation and definition of the classes of Infusoria,\r\nAnnelida, Arachnida, and Crustacea, the two latter groups being\r\nseparated from the insects. He also showed the distinctness of\r\nechinoderms from polyps, thus anticipating Leuckart, who established the\r\nphylum of Coelenterata nearly half a century later. His special work\r\nwas the classification of the great group of Mollusca, which he regarded\r\nas a class. When in our boyhood days we attempted to arrange our shells,\r\nwe were taught to use the Lamarckian system, that of Linné having been\r\ndiscarded many years previous. The great reforms in the classification\r\nof shells are evidenced by the numerous manuals of conchology based on\r\nthe works of Lamarck.\r\n\r\nWe used to hear much of the Lamarckian genera of shells, and Lamarck was\r\nthe first to perceive the necessity of breaking up into smaller\r\ncategories the few genera of Linné, which now are regarded as families.\r\nHe may be said to have had a wonderfully good eye for genera. All his\r\ngeneric divisions were at once accepted, since they were based on valid\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nThough not a comparative anatomist, he at once perceived the value of a\r\nknowledge of the internal structure of animals, and made effective use\r\nof the discoveries of Cuvier and of his predecessors--in fact, basing\r\nhis system of classification on the organs of respiration, circulation,\r\nand the nervous system.\r\n\r\nHe intimated that specific characters vary most, and that the peripheral\r\nparts of the body, as the shell, outer protective structures, the limbs,\r\nmouth-parts, antennæ, etc., are first affected by the causes which\r\nproduce variation, while he distinctly states that it requires a longer\r\ntime for variations to take place in the internal organs. On the latter\r\nhe relied in defining his classes.\r\n\r\nOne is curious to know how Lamarck viewed the question of species. This\r\nis discussed at length by him in his general essays, which are\r\nreproduced farther on in this biography, but his definition of what a\r\nspecies is far surpasses in breadth and terseness, and better satisfies\r\nthe views now prevailing, than that of any other author.\r\n\r\nHis definition of a species is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Every collection of similar individuals, perpetuated by generation\r\n  in the same condition, so long as the circumstances of their\r\n  situation do not change enough to produce variations in their\r\n  habits, character, and form.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck's rare skill, thoroughness, and acuteness as an observer,\r\ncombined with great breadth of view, were also supplemented by the\r\nadvantages arising from residence in Paris, and his connection with the\r\nMuseum of Natural History. Paris was in the opening years of the\r\nnineteenth century the chief centre of biological science. France having\r\nconvalesced from the intestinal disorders of the Revolution, and, as the\r\nresult of her foreign wars, adding to her territory and power, had begun\r\nwith the strength of a young giant to send out those splendid exploring\r\nexpeditions which gathered in collections in natural history from all\r\nparts of the known or accessible world, and poured them, as it were,\r\ninto the laps of the professors of the Jardin des Plantes. The shelves\r\nand cases of the galleries fairly groaned with the weight of the\r\nzoölogical riches which crowded them. From the year 1800 to 1832 the\r\nFrench government showed the greatest activity in sending out exploring\r\nexpeditions to Egypt, Africa, and the tropics.[119]\r\n\r\nThe zoölogists who explored Egypt were Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Savigny.\r\nThose who visited the East, the South Seas, the East Indian archipelago,\r\nand other regions were Bruguière, Olivier, Bory de St. Vincent, Péron,\r\nLesueur, Quoy, Gaimard, Le Vaillant, Edoux, and Souleyet. The natural\r\nresult was the enormous collections of the Jardin des Plantes, and\r\nconsequently enlarged views regarding the number and distribution of\r\nspecies, and their relation to their environment.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, about the time of Lamarck's death, flourished also Savigny,\r\nwho published his immortal works on the morphology of arthropods and of\r\nascidians; and Straus-Durckheim, whose splendidly illustrated volumes on\r\nthe anatomy of the cockchafer and of the cat will never cease to be of\r\nvalue; and É. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, whose elaborate and classical works\r\non vertebrate morphology, embryology, and comparative anatomy added so\r\nmuch to the prestige of French science.\r\n\r\nWe may be sure that Lamarck did his own work without help from others,\r\nand gave full credit to those who, like Defrance or Bruguière, aided or\r\nimmediately preceded him. He probably was lacking in executive force, or\r\nin the art which Cuvier knew so well to practise, of enlisting young men\r\nto do the drudgery or render material aid, and then, in some cases,\r\nneglecting to give them proper credit.\r\n\r\nThe first memoir or paper published on a zoölogical subject by Lamarck\r\nwas a modest one on shells, which appeared in 1792 in the _Journal\r\nd'Histoire naturelle_, the editors of which were Lamarck, Bruguière,\r\nOlivier, Haüy, and Pelletier. This paper was a review of an excellent\r\nmemoir by Bruguière, who preceded Lamarck in the work of dismemberment\r\nof the Linnæan genera. His next paper was on four new species of Helix.\r\nTo this _Journal_, of which only two volumes were published, Cuvier\r\ncontributed his first paper--namely, on some new species of \"Cloportes\"\r\n(Oniscus, a genus of terrestrial crustacea or \"pill-bugs\"); this was\r\nfollowed by his second memoir on the anatomy of the limpet, his next\r\narticle being descriptions of two species of flies from his collection\r\nof insects.[120] Seven years later Lamarck gave some account of the\r\ngenera of cuttlefishes. His first general memoir was a prodromus of a\r\nnew classification of shells (1799).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lamarck's knowledge of shells and corals was utilized by\r\nCuvier in his _Tableau élémentaire_, published in 1798, who acknowledges\r\nin the preface that in the exposition of the genera of shells he has\r\nbeen powerfully seconded, while he indicated to him (Cuvier) a part of\r\nthe subgenera of corals and alcyonarians, and adds, \"I have received\r\ngreat aid from the examination of his collection.\" Also he acknowledges\r\nthat he had been greatly aided (_puissamment secondé_) by Lamarck, who\r\nhad even indicated the most of the subdivisions established in his\r\n_Tableau élémentaire_ for the insects (Blainville, _l. c._, p. 129), and\r\nhe also accepted his genera of cuttlefishes.\r\n\r\nAfter this Lamarck judiciously refrained from publishing descriptions of\r\nnew species, and other fragmentary labors, and for some ten years from\r\nthe date of publication of his first zoölogical article reserved his\r\nstrength and elaborated his first general zoölogical work, a thick\r\noctavo volume of 452 pages, entitled _Système des Animaux sans\r\nVertèbres_, which appeared in 1801.\r\n\r\nLinné had divided all the animals below the vertebrates into two classes\r\nonly, the Insecta and Vermes, the insects comprising the present classes\r\nof insects, Myriapoda, Arachnida, and Crustacea; the Vermes embracing\r\nall the other invertebrate animals, from the molluscs to the monads.\r\n\r\nLamarck perceived the need of reform, of bringing order out of the\r\nchaotic mass of animal forms, and he says (p. 33) that he has been\r\ncontinually occupied since his attachment to the museum with this\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nHe relies for his characters, the fundamental ones, on the organs of\r\nrespiration, circulation, and on the form of the nervous system. The\r\nreasons he gives for his classification are sound and philosophical, and\r\npresented with the ease and aplomb of a master of taxonomy.\r\n\r\nHe divided the invertebrates, which Cuvier had called animals with white\r\nblood, into the seven following classes.\r\n\r\nWe place in a parallel column the classification of Cuvier in 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Classification of Lamarck._        _Classification of Cuvier._\r\n\r\n  1. Mollusca.                           I. _Mollusca._\r\n\r\n  2. Crustacea.                         II. _Insectes et Vers._\r\n\r\n  3. Arachnides (comprising                 1. Insectes.\r\n     the Myriapoda).                        2. Vers.\r\n\r\n  4. Insectes.                         III. _Zoophytes._\r\n\r\n  5. Vers.                                  1. Echinodermes.\r\n                                            2. Meduses, Animaux\r\n  6. Radiaires.                                infusorines, Rotifer,\r\n                                               Vibrio, Volvox.\r\n  7. Polypes.                               3. Zoophytes proprement\r\n                                               dits.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf these, four were for the first time defined, and the others\r\nrestricted. It will be noticed that he separates the Radiata\r\n(_Radiaires_) from the Polypes. His \"Radiaires\" included the\r\nEchinoderms (the _Vers echinoderms_ of Bruguière) and the Medusæ (his\r\n_Radiaires molasses_), the latter forming the Discophora and\r\nSiphonophora of present zoölogists. This is an anticipation of the\r\ndivision by Leuckart in 1839 of the Radiata of Cuvier into\r\nCoelenterata and Echinodermata.\r\n\r\nThe \"Polypes\" of Lamarck included not only the forms now known as such,\r\nbut also the Rotifera and Protozoa, though, as we shall see, he\r\nafterwards in his course of 1807 eliminated from this heterogeneous\r\nassemblage the Infusoria.\r\n\r\nComparing this classification with that of Cuvier[121] published in\r\n1798, we find that in the most important respects, _i.e._, the\r\nfoundation of the classes of Crustacea, Arachnida, and Radiata, there is\r\na great advance over Cuvier's system. In Cuvier's work the molluscs are\r\nseparated from the worms, and they are divided into three groups,\r\nCephalopodes, Gasteropodes, and Acephales--an arrangement which still\r\nholds, that of Lamarck into Mollusques céphalés and Mollusques acéphalés\r\nbeing much less natural. With the elimination of the Mollusca, Cuvier\r\nallowed the Vers or Vermes of Linné to remain undisturbed, except that\r\nthe Zoöphytes, the equivalent of Lamarck's Polypes, are separately\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nHe agrees with Cuvier in placing the molluscs at the head of the\r\ninvertebrates, a course still pursued by some zoölogists at the present\r\nday. He states in the _Philosophie Zoologique_[122] that in his course\r\nof lectures of the year 1799 he established the class of Crustacea, and\r\nadds that \"although this class is essentially distinct, it was not until\r\nsix or seven years after that some naturalists consented to adopt it.\"\r\nThe year following, or in his course of 1800, he separated from the\r\ninsects the class of Arachnida, as \"easy and necessary to be\r\ndistinguished.\" But in 1809 he says that this class \"is not yet admitted\r\ninto any other work than my own.\"[123] As to the class of Annelides, he\r\nremarks: \"Cuvier having discovered the existence of arterial and venous\r\nvessels in different animals which have been confounded under the name\r\nof worms (_Vers_) with other animals very differently organized, I\r\nimmediately employed the consideration of this new fact in rendering my\r\nclassification more perfect, and in my course of the year 10 (1802) I\r\nestablished the class of Annelides, a class which I have placed after\r\nthe molluscs and before the crustaceans, as their known organization\r\nrequires.\" He first established this class in his _Recherches sur les\r\ncorps vivans_ (1802), but it was several years before it was adopted by\r\nnaturalists.\r\n\r\nThe next work in which Lamarck deals with the classification of the\r\ninvertebrates is his _Discours d'ouverture du Cours des Animaux sans\r\nVertèbres_, published in 1806.\r\n\r\nOn page 70 he speaks of the animal chain or series, from the monad to\r\nman, ascending from the most simple to the most complex. The monad is\r\none of his _Polypes amorphs_, and he says that it is the most simple\r\nanimal form, the most like the original germ (_ébauche_) from which\r\nliving bodies have descended. From the monad nature passes to the\r\nVolvox, Proteus (Amoeba), and Vibrio. From them are derived the\r\n_Polypes rotifères_ and other \"Radiaires,\" and then the Vers,\r\nArachnides, and Crustacea. On page 77 a tabular view is presented, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    1. _Les Mollusques._\r\n    2. _Les Cirrhipèdes._\r\n    3. _Les Annelides._\r\n    4. _Les Crustacés._\r\n    5. _Les Arachnides._\r\n    6. _Les Insectes._\r\n    7. _Les Vers._\r\n    8. _Les Radiaires._\r\n    9. _Les Polypes._\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that at this date two additional classes are proposed\r\nand defined--_i.e._, the Annelides and the Cirrhipedes, though the class\r\nof Annelida was first privately characterized in his lectures for 1802.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of the barnacles or Cirrhipedes from the molluscs was a\r\ndecided step in advance, and was a proof of the acute observation and\r\nsound judgment of Lamarck. He says that this class is still very\r\nimperfectly known and its position doubtful, and adds: \"The Cirrhipedes\r\nhave up to the present time been placed among the molluscs, but\r\nalthough certain of them closely approach them in some respects, they\r\nhave a special character which compels us to separate them. In short, in\r\nthe genera best known the feet of these animals are distinctly\r\narticulated and even crustaceous (_crustacés_).\" He does not refer to\r\nthe nervous system, but this is done in his next work. It will be\r\nremembered that Cuvier overlooked this feature of the jointed limbs, and\r\nalso the crustaceous-like nervous system of the barnacles, and allowed\r\nthem to remain among the molluscs, notwithstanding the decisive step\r\ntaken by Lamarck. It was not until many years after (1830) that Thompson\r\nproved by their life-history that barnacles are true crustacea.\r\n\r\nIn the _Philosophie zoologique_ the ten classes of the invertebrates are\r\narranged in the following order:\r\n\r\n    _Les Mollusques._\r\n    _Les Cirrhipèdes._\r\n    _Les Annelides._\r\n    _Les Crustacés._\r\n    _Les Arachnides._\r\n    _Les Insectes._\r\n    _Les Vers._\r\n    _Les Radiaires._\r\n    _Les Polypes._\r\n    _Les Infusoires._\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second volume Lamarck gives a tabular view on a page\r\nby itself (p. 463), showing his conception of the origin of the\r\ndifferent groups of animals. This is the first phylogeny or genealogical\r\ntree ever published.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLEAU\r\n\r\nServant à montrer l'origine des differens animaux.\r\n\r\n    Vers.

In this work he distributed the\r\nfourteen classes of the animal kingdom into three groups, which he named\r\n_Animaux Apathiques_, _Sensibles_, and _Intelligens_. In this\r\nphysiologico-psychological base for a classification he unwisely\r\ndeparted from his usual more solid foundation of anatomical structure,\r\nand the results were worthless. He, however, repeats it in his great\r\nwork, _Histoire naturelle des Animaux sans Vertèbres_ (1815-1822).\r\n\r\nThe sponges were by Cuvier, and also by Lamarck, accorded a position\r\namong the Polypes, near Alcyonium, which represents the latter's\r\n_Polypiers empâtés_; and it is interesting to notice that, for many\r\nyears remaining among the Protozoa, meanwhile even by Agassiz regarded\r\nas vegetables, they were by Haeckel restored to a position among the\r\nCoelenterates, though for over twenty years they have by some American\r\nzoölogists been more correctly regarded as a separate phylum.[124]\r\nLamarck also separated the seals and morses from the cetacea. Adopting\r\nhis idea, Cuvier referred the seals to an order of carnivora.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting matter, to which Professor Lacaze-Duthiers has\r\ncalled attention in his interesting letter on p. 77, is the position\r\nassigned _Lucernaria_ among his _Radiaires molasses_ near what are now\r\nCtenophora and Medusæ, though one would have supposed he would, from\r\nits superficial resemblance to polyps, have placed it among the polyps.\r\nTo Lamarck we are also indebted for the establishment in 1818 of the\r\nmolluscan group of Heteropoda.\r\n\r\nLamarck's acuteness is also shown in the fact that, whereas Cuvier\r\nplaced them among the acephalous molluscs, he did not regard the\r\nascidians as molluscs at all, but places them in a class by themselves\r\nunder the name of _Tunicata_, following the Sipunculus worms. Yet he\r\nallowed them to remain near the Holothurians (then including Sipunculus)\r\nin his group of _Radiaires echinodermes_, between the latter and the\r\nVers. He differs from Cuvier in regarding the tunic as the homologue of\r\nthe shell of Lamellibranches, remarking that it differs in being\r\nmuscular and contractile.\r\n\r\nLamarck's fame as a zoölogist rests chiefly on this great work. It\r\nelicited the highest praise from his contemporaries. Besides containing\r\nthe innovations made in the classification of the animal kingdom, which\r\nhe had published in previous works, it was a summary of all which was\r\nthen known of the invertebrate classes, thus forming a most convenient\r\nhand-book, since it mentioned all the known genera and all the known\r\nspecies except those of the insects, of which only the types are\r\nmentioned. It passed through two editions, and still is not without\r\nvalue to the working systematist.\r\n\r\nIn his _Histoire des Progrès des Sciences naturelles_ Cuvier does it\r\njustice. Referring to the earlier volume, he states that \"it has\r\nextended immensely the knowledge, especially by a new distribution, of\r\nthe shelled molluscs ... M. de Lamarck has established with as much\r\ncare as sagacity the genera of shells.\" Again he says, in noticing the\r\nthree first volumes: \"The great detail into which M. de Lamarck has\r\nentered, the new species he has described, renders his work very\r\nvaluable to naturalists, and renders most desirable its prompt\r\ncontinuation, especially from the knowledge we have of means which this\r\nexperienced professor possesses to carry to a high degree of perfection\r\nthe enumeration which he will give us of the shells\" (_Oeuvres\r\ncomplètes de Buffon_, 1828, t. 31, p. 354).\r\n\r\n\"His excellences,\" says Cleland, speaking of Lamarck as a scientific\r\nobserver, \"were width of scope, fertility of ideas, and a preëminent\r\nfaculty of precise description, arising not only from a singularly terse\r\nstyle, but from a clear insight into both the distinctive features and\r\nthe resemblance of forms\" (_Encyc. Britannica_, Art. LAMARCK).\r\n\r\nThe work, moreover, is remarkable for being the first one to begin with\r\nthe simplest and to end with the most highly developed forms.\r\n\r\nLamarck's special line of study was the Mollusca. How his work is still\r\nregarded by malacologists is shown by the following letter from our\r\nleading student of molluscs, Dr. W. H. Dall:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,\r\n        \"UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\n            \"_November 4, 1899._\r\n\r\n  \"Lamarck was one of the best naturalists of his time, when geniuses\r\n  abounded. His work was the first well-marked step toward a natural\r\n  system as opposed to the formalities of Linné. He owed something to\r\n  Cuvier, yet he knew how to utilize the work in anatomy offered by\r\n  Cuvier in making a natural classification. His failing eyesight,\r\n  which obliged him latterly to trust to the eyes of others; his\r\n  poverty and trials of various kinds, more than excuse the occasional\r\n  slips which we find in some of the later volumes of the _Animaux\r\n  sans Vertèbres_. These are rather of the character of typographical\r\n  errors than faults of scheme or principle.\r\n\r\n  \"The work of Lamarck is really the foundation of rational natural\r\n  malacological classification; practically all that came before his\r\n  time was artificial in comparison. Work that came later was in the\r\n  line of expansion and elaboration of Lamarck's, without any change\r\n  of principle. Only with the application of embryology and\r\n  microscopical work of the most modern type has there come any\r\n  essential change of method, and this is rather a new method of\r\n  getting at the facts than any fundamental change in the way of using\r\n  them when found. I shall await your work on Lamarck's biography with\r\n  great interest.\r\n\r\n    \"I remain,\r\n        \"Yours sincerely,\r\n            \"WILLIAM H. DALL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[119] During the same period (1803-1829) Russia sent out expeditions to\r\nthe North and Northeast, accompanied by the zoölogists Tilesius,\r\nLangsdorff, Chamisso, Eschscholtz, and Brandt, all of them of German\r\nbirth and education. From 1823 to 1850 England fitted up and sent out\r\nexploring expeditions commanded by Beechey, Fitzroy, Belcher, Ross,\r\nFranklin, and Stanley, the naturalists of which were Bennett, Owen,\r\nDarwin, Adams, and Huxley. From Germany, less of a maritime country, at\r\na later date, Humboldt, Spix, Prince Wied-Neuwied, Natterer, Perty, and\r\nothers made memorable exploring expeditions and journeys.\r\n\r\n[120] These papers have been mercilessly criticised by Blainville in his\r\n\"Cuvier et Geoffroy St. Hilaire.\" In the second article--_i.e._, on the\r\nanatomy of the limpet--Cuvier, in considering the organs, follows no\r\ndefinite plan; he gives a description \"_tout-a-fait fantastique_\" of the\r\nmuscular fibres of the foot, and among other errors in this first essay\r\non comparative anatomy he mistakes the tongue for the intromittent\r\norgan; the salivary glands, and what is probably part of the brain,\r\nbeing regarded as the testes, with other \"_erreurs matérielles\r\ninconcevables, même à l'époque ou elle fut rédigée_.\" In his first\r\narticle he mistakes a species of the myriapod genus Glomeris for the\r\nisopod genus Armadillo. In this he is corrected by the editor (possibly\r\nLamarck himself), who remarks in a footnote that the forms to which\r\nM. Cuvier refers under the name of Armadillo are veritable species of\r\nJulus. We have verified these criticisms of Cuvier by reference to his\r\npapers in the \"Journal.\" It is of interest to note, as Blainville does,\r\nthat Cuvier at this period admits that there is a passage from the\r\nIsopoda to the armadilloes and Julus. Cuvier, then twenty-three years\r\nold, wrote: \"_Nous sommes donc descendus par degrès, des Écrevisses aux\r\nSquilles, de celles-ci aux Aselles, puis aux Cloportes, aux Armadilles\r\net aux Ïules_\" (_Journal d'Hist. nat._, tom. ii., p. 29, 1792). These\r\nerrors, as regards the limpet, were afterwards corrected by Cuvier\r\n(though he does not refer to his original papers) in his _Mémoires pour\r\nservir à l'Histoire et à l'Anatomie des Mollusques_ (1817).\r\n\r\n[121] _Tableau élémentaire de l'Histoire naturelle des Animaux._ Paris,\r\nAn VI.

Cuvier et de Lamarck les en out distingués par des\r\ncaractères de premier ordre tirés de leur circulation._\" Undoubtedly\r\nCuvier described the circulation, but it was Lamarck who actually\r\nrealized the taxonomic importance of this feature and placed them in a\r\ndistinct class.\r\n\r\n[124] See A. Hyatt's _Revision of North American Poriferæ_, Part II.\r\n(Boston, 1877, p. 11); also the present writer in his _Text-book of\r\nZoölogy_ (1878).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWS OF BUFFON AND OF GEOFFROY ST. HILAIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the French precursors of Lamarck there were four--Duret (1609), De\r\nMaillet (1748), Robinet (1768), and Buffon. The opinions of the first\r\nthree could hardly be taken seriously, as they were crude and fantastic,\r\nthough involving the idea of descent. The suggestions and hypotheses of\r\nBuffon and of Erasmus Darwin were of quite a different order, and\r\ndeserve careful consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAISON DE BUFFON, IN WHICH LAMARCK LIVED, 1793-1829]\r\n\r\nGeorge Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, was born in 1707 at Montbard,\r\nBurgundy, in the same year as Linné. He died at Paris in 1788, at the\r\nage of eighty-one years. He inherited a large property from his father,\r\nwho was a councillor of the parliament of Burgundy. He studied at Dijon,\r\nand travelled abroad. Buffon was rich, but, greatly to his credit,\r\ndevoted all his life to the care of the Royal Garden and to writing his\r\nworks, being a most prolific author. He was not an observer, not even a\r\ncloset naturalist. \"I have passed,\" he is reported to have said, \"fifty\r\nyears at my desk.\" Appointed in 1739, when he was thirty-two years old,\r\nIntendant of the Royal Garden, he divided his time between his retreat\r\nat Montbard and Paris, spending four months in Paris and the remainder\r\nof the year at Montbard, away from the distractions and dissipations of\r\nthe capital. It is significant that he wrote his great _Histoire\r\nnaturelle_ at Montbard and not at Paris, where were the collections of\r\nnatural history.\r\n\r\nHis biographer, Flourens, says: \"What dominates in the character of\r\nBuffon is elevation, force, the love of greatness and glory; he loved\r\nmagnificence in everything. His fine figure, his majestic air, seemed to\r\nhave some relation with the greatness of his genius; and nature had\r\nrefused him none of those qualities which could attract the attention of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is better known than the _naïveté_ of his self-esteem; he\r\nadmired himself with perfect honesty, frankly, but good-naturedly.\"\r\n\r\nHe was once asked how many great men he could really mention; he\r\nanswered: \"Five--Newton, Bacon, Leibnitz, Montesquieu, and myself.\" His\r\nadmirable style gained him immediate reputation and glory throughout the\r\nworld of letters. His famous epigram, \"_Le style est l'homme même_\" is\r\nfamiliar to every one. That his moral courage was scarcely of a high\r\norder is proved by his little affair with the theologians of the\r\nSorbonne. Buffon was not of the stuff of which martyrs are made.\r\n\r\nHis forte was that of a brilliant writer and most industrious compiler,\r\na popularizer of science. He was at times a bold thinker; but his\r\nprudence, not to say timidity, in presenting in his ironical way his\r\nthoughts on the origin of things, is annoying, for we do not always\r\nunderstand what Buffon did really believe about the mutability or the\r\nfixity of species, as too plain speaking in the days he wrote often led\r\nto persecution and personal hazard.[125]\r\n\r\nHis cosmological ideas were based on those of Burnet and Leibnitz. His\r\ngeological notions were founded on the labors of Palissy, Steno,\r\nWoodward, and Whiston. He depended upon his friend Daubenton for\r\nanatomical facts, and on Gueneau de Montbéliard and the Abbé Bexon for\r\nhis zoölogical data. As Flourens says, \"Buffon was not exactly an\r\nobserver: others observed and discovered for him. He discovered,\r\nhimself, the observations of others; he sought for ideas, others sought\r\nfacts for him.\" How fulsome his eulogists were is seen in the case of\r\nFlourens, who capped the climax in exclaiming, \"Buffon is Leibnitz with\r\nthe eloquence of Plato;\" and he adds, \"He did not write for savants: he\r\nwrote for all mankind.\" No one now reads Buffon, while the works of\r\nRéaumur, who preceded him, are nearly as valuable as ever, since they\r\nare packed with careful observations.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Redi, of Swammerdam, and of Vallisneri, and the\r\nobservations of Réaumur, had no effect on Buffon, who maintained that,\r\nof the different forms of genesis, \"spontaneous generation\" is not only\r\nthe most frequent and the most general, but the most ancient--namely,\r\nthe primitive and the most universal.[126]\r\n\r\nBuffon by nature was unsystematic, and he possessed little of the spirit\r\nor aim of the true investigator. He left no technical papers or memoirs,\r\nor what we would call contributions to science. In his history of\r\nanimals he began with the domestic breeds, and then described those of\r\nmost general, popular interest, those most known. He knew, as\r\nMalesherbes claimed, little about the works even of Linné and other\r\nsystematists, neither grasping their principles nor apparently caring to\r\nknow their methods. His single positive addition to zoölogical science\r\nwas generalizations on the geographical distribution of animals. He\r\nrecognized that the animals of the tropical and southern portions of the\r\nold and new worlds were entirely unlike, while those of North America\r\nand northern Eurasia were in many cases the same.\r\n\r\nWe will first bring together, as Flourens and also Butler have done, his\r\nscattered fragmentary views, or rather suggestions, on the fixity of\r\nspecies, and then present his thoughts on the mutability of species.\r\n\"The species\" is then \"an abstract and general term.\"[127] \"There only\r\nexist individuals and _suites_ of individuals, that is to say,\r\nspecies.\"[128] He also says that Nature \"imprints on each species its\r\nunalterable characters;\" that \"each species has an equal right to\r\ncreation;\"[129] that species, even those nearest allied, \"are separated\r\nby an interval over which nature cannot pass;\"[130] and that \"each\r\nspecies having been independently created, the first individuals have\r\nserved as a model for their descendants.\"[131]\r\n\r\nBuffon, however, shows the true scientific spirit in speaking of final\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n  \"The pig,\" he says, \"is not formed as an original, special, and\r\n  perfect type; its type is compounded of that of many other animals.\r\n  It has parts which are evidently useless, or which, at any rate, it\r\n  cannot use.\" ... \"But we, ever on the lookout to refer all parts to\r\n  a certain end--when we can see no apparent use for them, suppose\r\n  them to have hidden uses, and imagine connections which are without\r\n  foundation, and serve only to obscure our perception of Nature as\r\n  she really is: we fail to see that we thus rob philosophy of her\r\n  true character, which is to inquire into the 'how' of these\r\n  things--into the manner in which Nature acts--and that we substitute\r\n  for this true object a vain idea, seeking to divine the 'why'--the\r\n  ends which she has proposed in acting\" (tome v., p. 104, 1755, _ex_\r\n  Butler).\r\n\r\nThe volumes of the _Histoire naturelle_ on animals, beginning with\r\ntome iv., appeared in the years 1753 to 1767, or over a period of\r\nfourteen years. Butler, in his _Evolution, Old and New_, effectually\r\ndisposes of Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire's statement that at the\r\nbeginning of his work (tome iv., 1753) he affirms the fixity of species,\r\nwhile from 1761 to 1766 he declares for variability. But Butler asserts\r\nfrom his reading of the first edition that \"from the very first chapter\r\nonward he leant strongly to mutability, even if he did not openly avow\r\nhis belief in it.... The reader who turns to Buffon himself will find\r\nthat the idea that Buffon took a less advanced position in his old age\r\nthan he had taken in middle life is also without foundation\"[132]\r\n(p. 104).\r\n\r\nBut he had more to say on the other side, that of the mutability of\r\nspecies, and it is these tentative views that his commentators have\r\nassumed to have been his real sentiments or belief, and for this reason\r\nplace Buffon among the evolutionists, though he had little or no idea of\r\nevolution in the enlarged and thoroughgoing sense of Lamarck.\r\n\r\nHe states, however, that the presence of callosities on the legs of the\r\ncamel and llama \"are the unmistakable results of rubbing or friction; so\r\nalso with the callosities of baboons and the pouched monkeys, and the\r\ndouble soles of man's feet.\"[133] In this point he anticipates Erasmus\r\nDarwin and Lamarck. As we shall see, however, his notions were much less\r\nfirmly grounded than those of Erasmus Darwin, who was a close observer\r\nas well as a profound thinker.\r\n\r\nIn his chapter on the _Dégénération des Animaux_, or, as it is\r\ntranslated, \"modification of animals,\" Buffon insists that the three\r\ncauses are climate, food, and domestication. The examples he gives are\r\nthe sheep, which having originated, as he thought, from the mufflon,\r\nshows marked changes. The ox varies under the influence of food; reared\r\nwhere the pasturage is rich it is twice the size of those living in a\r\ndry country. The races of the torrid zones bear a hump on their\r\nshoulders; \"the zebu, the buffalo, is, in short, only a variety, only a\r\nrace of our domestic ox.\" He attributed the camel's hump to domesticity.\r\nHe refers the changes of color in the northern hare to the simple change\r\nof seasons.\r\n\r\nHe is most explicit in referring to the agency of climate, and also to\r\ntime and to the uniformity of nature's processes in causing variation.\r\nWriting in 1756 he says:\r\n\r\n  \"If we consider each species in the different climates which it\r\n  inhabits we shall find perceptible varieties as regards size and\r\n  form; they all derive an impress to a greater or less extent from\r\n  the climate in which they live. These changes are only made slowly\r\n  and imperceptibly. Nature's great workman is time. He marches ever\r\n  with an even pace and does nothing by leaps and bounds, but by\r\n  degrees, gradations, and succession he does all things; and the\r\n  changes which he works--at first imperceptible--become little by\r\n  little perceptible, and show themselves eventually in results about\r\n  which there can be no mistake. Nevertheless, animals in a free, wild\r\n  state are perhaps less subject than any other living beings, man not\r\n  excepted, to alterations, changes, and variations of all kinds.\r\n  Being free to choose their own food and climate, they vary less than\r\n  domestic animals vary.\"[134]\r\n\r\nThe Buffonian factor of the direct influence of climate is not in\r\ngeneral of so thoroughgoing a character as usually supposed by the\r\ncommentators of Buffon. He generally applies it to the superficial\r\nchanges, such as the increase or decrease in the amount of hair, or\r\nsimilar modifications not usually regarded as specific characters. The\r\nmodifications due to the direct influence of climate may be effected, he\r\nsays, within even a few generations.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of geographical distribution (in tome ix., 1761), in\r\nwhich subject Buffon made his most original contribution to exact\r\nbiology, he claims to have been the first \"even to have suspected\" that\r\nnot a single tropical species is common to both eastern and western\r\ncontinents, but that the animals common to both continents are those\r\nadapted to a temperate or cold climate. He even anticipates the subject\r\nof migration in past geological times by supposing that those forms\r\ntravelled from the Old World either over some land still unknown, or\r\n\"more probably\" over territory which has long since been submerged.[135]\r\n\r\n  The mammoth \"was certainly the greatest and strongest of all\r\n  quadrupeds, but it has disappeared; and if so, how many smaller,\r\n  feebler, and less remarkable species must have perished without\r\n  leaving us any traces or even hints of their having existed? How\r\n  many other species have changed their nature, that is to say,\r\n  become perfected or degraded, through great changes in the\r\n  distribution of land and ocean; through the cultivation or neglect\r\n  of the country which they inhabit; through the long-continued\r\n  effects of climatic changes, so that they are no longer the same\r\n  animals that they once were. Yet of all living beings after man the\r\n  quadrupeds are the ones whose nature is most fixed and form most\r\n  constant; birds and fishes vary much more easily; insects still more\r\n  again than these; and if we descend to plants, which certainly\r\n  cannot be excluded from animated nature, we shall be surprised at\r\n  the readiness with which species are seen to vary, and at the ease\r\n  with which they change their forms and adopt new natures.\"[136]\r\n\r\nThe following passages, debarring the error of deriving all the American\r\nfrom the Old World forms, and the mistake in supposing that the American\r\nforms grew smaller than their ancestors in the Old World, certainly\r\nsmack of the principle of isolation and segregation, and this is\r\nBuffon's most important contribution to the theory of descent.\r\n\r\n  \"It is probable, then, that all the animals of the New World are\r\n  derived from congeners in the Old, without any deviation from the\r\n  ordinary course of nature. We may believe that, having become\r\n  separated in the lapse of ages by vast oceans and countries which\r\n  they could not traverse, they have gradually been affected by, and\r\n  derived impressions from, a climate which has itself been modified\r\n  so as to become a new one through the operations of those same\r\n  causes which dissociated the individuals of the Old and the New\r\n  World from one another; thus in the course of time they have grown\r\n  smaller and changed their characters. This, however, should not\r\n  prevent our classifying them as different species now, for the\r\n  difference is no less real though it dates from the creation.\r\n  _Nature, I maintain, is in a state of continual flux and movement.\r\n  It is enough for man if he can grasp her as she is in his own time,\r\n  and throw but a glance or two upon the past and future, so as to try\r\n  and perceive what she may have been in former times and what one day\r\n  she may attain to._\"[137]\r\n\r\nBuffon thus suggests the principle of the struggle for existence to\r\nprevent overcrowding, resulting in the maintenance of the balance of\r\nnature:\r\n\r\n  \"It may be said that the movement of Nature turns upon two immovable\r\n  pivots--one, the illimitable fecundity which she has given to all\r\n  species; the other, the innumerable difficulties which reduce the\r\n  results of that fecundity, and leave throughout time nearly the same\r\n  quantity of individuals in every species; ... destruction and\r\n  sterility follow closely upon excessive fecundity, and,\r\n  independently of the contagion which follows inevitably upon\r\n  overcrowding, each species has its own special sources of death and\r\n  destruction, which are of themselves sufficient to compensate for\r\n  excess in any past generation.\"[138]\r\n\r\nHe also adds, \"The species the least perfect, the most delicate, the\r\nmost unwieldy, the least active, the most unarmed, etc., have already\r\ndisappeared or will disappear.\"[139]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, in writing on the dog, he anticipates Erasmus Darwin\r\nand Lamarck in ascribing to the direct cause of modification the inner\r\nfeelings of the animal modified, change of condition being the indirect\r\ncause.[140] He, however, did not suggest the idea of the transmission of\r\nacquired characters by heredity, and does not mention the word heredity.\r\n\r\nThese are all the facts he stated; but though not an observer, Buffon\r\nwas a broad thinker, and was led from these few data to generalize, as\r\nhe could well do, from the breadth of his knowledge of geology gained\r\nfrom the works of his predecessors, from Leibnitz to Woodward and\r\nWhiston.\r\n\r\n  \"After the rapid glance,\" he says, \"at these variations, which\r\n  indicate to us the special changes undergone by each species, there\r\n  arises a more important consideration, and the view of which is\r\n  broader; it is that of the transformation (_changement_) of the\r\n  species themselves; it is that more ancient modification which has\r\n  gone on from time immemorial, which seems to have been made in each\r\n  family or, if we prefer, in each of the genera in which were\r\n  comprised more or less allied species.\"[141]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of his first volume he states \"that we can descend by\r\nalmost imperceptible degrees from the most perfect creature to the most\r\nformless matter--from the most highly organized animal to the most\r\nentirely inorganic substance. We will recognize this gradation as the\r\ngreat work of nature; and we will observe it not only as regards size\r\nand form, but also in respect of movements and in the successive\r\ngenerations of every species.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Hence,\" he continues, \"arises the difficulty of arriving at any\r\n  perfect system or method in dealing either with nature as a whole or\r\n  even with any single one of her subdivisions. The gradations are so\r\n  subtle that we are often obliged to make arbitrary divisions. Nature\r\n  knows nothing about our classifications, and does not choose to lend\r\n  herself to them without reasons. We therefore see a number of\r\n  intermediate species and objects which it is very hard to classify,\r\n  and which of necessity derange our system, whatever it may be.\"[142]\r\n\r\nThis is all true, and was probably felt by Buffon's predecessors, but it\r\ndoes not imply that he thought these forms had descended from one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n  \"In thus comparing,\" he adds, \"all the animals, and placing them\r\n  each in its proper genus, we shall find that the two hundred species\r\n  whose history we have given may be reduced to a quite small number\r\n  of families or principal sources from which it is not impossible\r\n  that all the others may have issued.\"[143]\r\n\r\nHe then establishes, on the one hand, nine species which he regarded as\r\nisolated, and, on the other, fifteen principal genera, primitive sources\r\nor, as we would say, ancestral forms, from which he derived all the\r\nanimals (mammals) known to him.\r\n\r\nHence he believed that he could derive the dog, the jackal, the wolf,\r\nand the fox from a single one of these four species; yet he remarks,\r\n_per contra_, in 1753:\r\n\r\n  \"Although we cannot demonstrate that the production of a species by\r\n  modification is a thing impossible to nature, the number of\r\n  contrary probabilities is so enormous that, even philosophically, we\r\n  can scarcely doubt it; for if any species has been produced by the\r\n  modification of another, if the species of ass has been derived from\r\n  that of the horse, this could have been done only successively and\r\n  by gradual steps: there would have been between the horse and ass a\r\n  great number of intermediate animals, the first of which would\r\n  gradually differ from the nature of the horse, and the last would\r\n  gradually approach that of the ass; and why do we not see to-day the\r\n  representatives, the descendants of those intermediate species? Why\r\n  are only the two extremes living?\" (tome iv., p. 390). \"If we once\r\n  admit that the ass belongs to the horse family, and that it only\r\n  differs from it because it has been modified (_dégénéré_), we may\r\n  likewise say that the monkey is of the same family as man, that it\r\n  is a modified man, that man and the monkey have had a common origin\r\n  like the horse and ass, that each family has had but a single\r\n  source, and even that all the animals have come from a single\r\n  animal, which in the succession of ages has produced, while\r\n  perfecting and modifying itself, all the races of other animals\"\r\n  (tome iv., p. 382). \"If it were known that in the animals there had\r\n  been, I do not say several species, but a single one which had been\r\n  produced by modification from another species; if it were true that\r\n  the ass is only a modified horse, there would be no limit to the\r\n  power of nature, and we would not be wrong in supposing that from a\r\n  single being she has known how to derive, with time, all the other\r\n  organized beings\" (_ibid._, p. 382).\r\n\r\nThe next sentence, however, translated, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"But no. It is certain from revelation that all animals have alike\r\n  been favored with the grace of an act of direct creation, and that\r\n  the first pair of every species issued fully formed from the hands\r\n  of the Creator\" (tome iv., p. 383).\r\n\r\nIn which of these views did Buffon really believe? Yet they appear in\r\nthe same volume, and not at different periods of his life.\r\n\r\nHe actually does say in the same volume (iv., p. 358): \"It is not\r\nimpossible that all species may be derivations (_issues_).\" In the same\r\nvolume also (p. 215) he remarks:\r\n\r\n  \"There is in nature a general prototype in each species on which\r\n  each individual is modelled, but which seems, in being realized, to\r\n  change or become perfected by circumstances; so that, relatively to\r\n  certain qualities, there is a singular (_bizarre_) variation in\r\n  appearance in the succession of individuals, and at the same time a\r\n  constancy in the entire species which appears to be admirable.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet we find him saying at the same period of his life, in the\r\nprevious volume, that species \"are the only beings in nature, beings\r\nperpetual, as ancient, as permanent as she.\"[144] A few pages farther on\r\nin the same volume of the same work, apparently written at the same\r\ntime, he is strongly and stoutly anti-evolutional, affirming: \"The\r\nimprint of each species is a type whose principal features are graven in\r\ncharacters forever ineffaceable and permanent.\"[145]\r\n\r\nIn this volume (iv., p. 55) he remarks that the senses, whether in man\r\nor in animals, may be greatly developed by exercise.\r\n\r\nThe impression left on the mind, after reading Buffon, is that even if\r\nhe threw out these suggestions and then retracted them, from fear of\r\nannoyance or even persecution from the bigots of his time, he did not\r\nhimself always take them seriously, but rather jotted them down as\r\npassing thoughts. Certainly he did not present them in the formal,\r\nforcible, and scientific way that Erasmus Darwin did. The result is that\r\nthe tentative views of Buffon, which have to be with much research\r\nextracted from the forty-four volumes of his works, would now be\r\nregarded as in a degree superficial and valueless. But they appeared\r\nthirty-four years before Lamarck's theory, and though not epoch-making,\r\nthey are such as will render the name of Buffon memorable for all time.\r\n\r\n\r\nÉTIENNE GEOFFROY ST. HILAIRE.\r\n\r\nÉtienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire was born at Étampes, April 15, 1772. He\r\ndied in Paris in 1844. He was destined for the church, but his tastes\r\nwere for a scientific career. His acquaintance with the Abbé Haüy and\r\nDaubenton led him to study mineralogy. He was the means of liberating\r\nHaüy from a political prison; the Abbé, as the result of the events of\r\nAugust, 1792, being promptly set free at the request of the Academy of\r\nSciences. The young Geoffroy was in his turn aided by the illustrious\r\nHaüy, who obtained for him the position of sub-guardian and demonstrator\r\nof mineralogy in the Cabinet of Natural History. At the early age of\r\ntwenty-one years, as we have seen, he was elected professor of zoölogy\r\nin the museum, in charge of the department of mammals and birds. He was\r\nthe means of securing for Cuvier, then of his own age, a position in the\r\nmuseum as professor-adjunct of comparative anatomy. For two years (1795\r\nand 1796) the two youthful savants were inseparable, sharing the same\r\napartments, the same table, the same amusements, the same studies, and\r\ntheir scientific papers were prepared in company and signed in common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: É. GEOFFROY ST. HILAIRE]\r\n\r\nGeoffroy became a member of the great scientific commission sent to\r\nEgypt by Napoleon (1789-1802). By his boldness and presence of mind he,\r\nwith Savigny and the botanist Delille, saved the treasures which at\r\nAlexandria had fallen into the hands of the English general in command.\r\nIn 1808 he was charged by Napoleon with the duty of organizing public\r\ninstruction in Portugal. Here again, by his address and firmness, he\r\nsaved the collections and exchanges made there from the hands of the\r\nEnglish. When thirty-six years old he was elected a member of the\r\nInstitute.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 he began to discuss philosophical anatomy, the doctrine of\r\nhomologies; he also studied the embryology of the mammals, and was the\r\nfounder of teratology. It was he who discovered the vestigial teeth of\r\nthe baleen whale and those of embryo birds, and the bearing of this on\r\nthe doctrine of descent must have been obvious to him.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1795, before Lamarck had changed his views as to the\r\nstability of species, the young Geoffroy, then twenty-three years old,\r\ndared to claim that species may be only \"_les diverses dégénérations\r\nd'un même type_.\" These views he did not abandon, nor, on the other\r\nhand, did he actively promulgate them. It was not until thirty years\r\nlater, in his memoir on the anatomy of the gavials, that he began the\r\nseries of his works bearing on the question of species. In 1831 was held\r\nthe famous debates between himself and Cuvier in the Academy of\r\nSciences. But the contest was not so much on the causes of the variation\r\nof species as on the doctrine of homologies and the unity of\r\norganization in the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Geoffroy did not adopt the views peculiar to his old friend\r\nLamarck, but was rather a follower of Buffon. His views were preceded by\r\ntwo premises.\r\n\r\nThe species is only \"_fixé sous la raison du maintien de l'état\r\nconditionnel de son milieu ambiant_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is modified, it changes, if the environment (_milieu ambiant_)\r\nvaries, and according to the extent (selon la portée) of the variations\r\nof the latter.[146]\r\n\r\nAs the result, among recent or living beings there are no essential\r\ndifferences as regards them--\"_c'est le même cours d'événements_,\" or\r\n\"_la même marche d'excitation_.\"[147]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the _monde ambiant_ having undergone more or less\r\nconsiderable change from one geological epoch to another, the atmosphere\r\nhaving even varied in its chemical composition, and the conditions of\r\nrespiration having been thus modified,[148] the beings then living would\r\ndiffer in structure from their ancestors of ancient times, and would\r\ndiffer from them according \"to the degree of the modifying power.\"[149]\r\nAgain, he says, \"The animals living to-day have been derived by a series\r\nof uninterrupted generations from the extinct animals of the\r\nantediluvian world.\"[150] He gave as an example the crocodiles of the\r\npresent day, which he believed to have descended from the fossil forms.\r\nWhile he admitted the possibility of one type passing into another,\r\nseparated by characters of more than generic value, he always, according\r\nto his son Isidore, rejected the view which made all the living species\r\ndescend \"_d'une espèce antediluvienne primitive_.\"[151] It will be seen\r\nthat Geoffroy St. Hilaire's views were chiefly based on palæontological\r\nevidence. He was throughout broad and philosophical, and his eloquent\r\ndemonstration in his _Philosophie anatomique_ of the doctrine of\r\nhomologies served to prepare the way for modern morphology, and affords\r\none of the foundation stones on which rests the theory of descent.\r\nThough temporarily vanquished in the debate with Cuvier, who was a\r\nforceful debater and represented the views then prevalent, a later\r\ngeneration acknowledges that he was in the right, and remembers him as\r\none of the founders of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[125] Mr. Morley, in his _Rousseau_, gives a startling picture of the\r\nhostility of the parliament at the period (1762) when Buffon's works\r\nappeared. Not only was Rousseau hunted out of France, and his books\r\nburnt by the public executioner, but there was \"hardly a single man of\r\nletters of that time who escaped arbitrary imprisonment\" (p. 270); among\r\nothers thus imprisoned was Diderot. At this time (1750-1765) Malesherbes\r\n(born 1721, guillotined 1794), one of the \"best instructed and most\r\nenlightened men of the century,\" was Directeur de la Libraire. \"The\r\nprocess was this: a book was submitted to him; he named a censor for it;\r\non the censor's report the director gave or refused permission to print\r\nor required alterations. Even after these formalities were complied\r\nwith, the book was liable to a decree of the royal council, a decree of\r\nthe parliament, or else a lettre-de-cachet might send the author to the\r\nBastille\" (Morley's _Rousseau_, p. 266).\r\n\r\n[126] _Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière._ 1st edition.\r\nImprimerie royale.

He was an English country physician with\r\na large practice, and not only interested in philosophy, mechanics, and\r\nnatural science, but given to didactic rhyming, as evinced by _The\r\nBotanical Garden_ and _The Loves of the Plants_, the latter of which was\r\ntranslated into French in 1800, and into Italian in 1805. His \"shrewd\r\nand homely mind,\" his powers of keen observation and strong common sense\r\nwere revealed in his celebrated work _Zoonomia_, which was published in\r\ntwo volumes in 1794, and translated into German in 1795-99. He was not a\r\nzoölogist, published no separate scientific articles, and his striking\r\nand original views on evolution, which were so far in advance of his\r\ntime, appear mostly in the section on \"Generation,\" comprising 173 pages\r\nof his _Zoonomia_,[152] which was mainly a medical work. The book was\r\nwidely read, excited much discussion, and his views decided opposition.\r\nSamuel Butler in his _Evolution, Old and New_ (1879) remarks: \"Paley's\r\n_Natural Theology_ is written throughout at the _Zoonomia_, though he\r\nis careful, _moro suo_, never to mention this work by name. Paley's\r\nsuccess was probably one of the chief causes of the neglect into which\r\nthe Buffonian and Darwinian systems fell in this country.\" Dr. Darwin\r\ndied in the same year (1802) as that in which the _Natural Theology_ was\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nKrause also writes of the reception given by his contemporaries to his\r\n\"physio-philosophical ideas.\" \"They spoke of his wild and eccentric\r\nfancies, and the expression 'Darwinising' (as employed, for example, by\r\nthe poet Coleridge when writing on Stillingfleet) was accepted in\r\nEngland nearly as the antithesis of sober biological investigation.\"[153]\r\n\r\nThe grandson of Erasmus Darwin had little appreciation of the views of\r\nhim of whom, through atavic heredity, he was the intellectual and\r\nscientific child. \"It is curious,\" he says in the 'Historical Sketch' of\r\nthe _Origin of Species_--\"it is curious how largely my grandfather,\r\nDr. Erasmus Darwin, anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of\r\nopinion of Lamarck in his _Zoonomia_ (vol. i., pp. 500-510), published\r\nin 1794.\" It seems a little strange that Charles Darwin did not devote a\r\nfew lines to stating just what his ancestor's views were, for certain of\r\nthem, as we shall see, are anticipations of his own.\r\n\r\nThe views of Erasmus Darwin may thus be summarily stated:\r\n\r\n1. All animals have originated \"from a single living filament\" (p. 230),\r\nor, stated in other words, referring to the warm-blooded animals alone,\r\n\"one is led to conclude that they have alike been produced from a\r\nsimilar living filament\" (p. 236); and again he expresses the conjecture\r\nthat one and the same kind of living filament is and has been the cause\r\nof all organic life (p. 244). It does not follow that he was a\r\n\"spermist,\" since he strongly argued against the incasement or\r\n\"evolution\" theory of Bonnet.\r\n\r\n2. Changes produced by differences of climate and even seasons. Thus\r\n\"the sheep of warm climates are covered with hair instead of wool, and\r\nthe hares and partridges of the latitudes which are long buried in snow\r\nbecome white during the winter months\" (p. 234). Only a passing\r\nreference is made to this factor, and the effects of domestication are\r\nbut cursorily referred to. In this respect Darwin's views differed much\r\nfrom Buffon's, with whom they were the primary causes in the\r\nmodification of animals.\r\n\r\nThe other factors or agencies are not referred to by Buffon, showing\r\nthat Darwin was not indebted to Buffon, but thought out the matter in\r\nhis own independent way.\r\n\r\n3. \"Fifthly, from their first rudiment or primordium to the termination\r\nof their lives, all animals undergo perpetual transformations, which are\r\nin part produced by their own exertions in consequence of their desires\r\nand aversions, of their pleasures and their pains, or of irritations or\r\nof associations; and many of these acquired forms or propensities are\r\ntransmitted to their posterity\" (p. 237). The three great objects of\r\ndesire are, he says, \"lust, hunger, and security\" (p. 237).\r\n\r\n4. Contests of the males for the possession of the females, or law of\r\nbattle. Under the head of desire he dwells on the desire of the male for\r\nthe exclusive possession of the female; and \"these have acquired weapons\r\nto combat each other for this purpose,\" as the very thick, shield-like\r\nhorny skin on the shoulders of the boar, and his tusks, the horns of the\r\nstag, the spurs of cocks and quails. \"The final cause,\" he says, \"of\r\nthis contest among the males seems to be that the strongest and most\r\nactive animal should propagate the species, which should thence become\r\nimproved\" (p. 238). This savors so strongly of sexual selection that we\r\nwonder very much that Charles Darwin repudiated it as \"erroneous.\" It is\r\nnot mentioned by Lamarck, nor is Dr. Darwin's statement of the exertions\r\nand desires of animals at all similar to Lamarck's, who could not have\r\nborrowed his ideas on appetency from Darwin or any other predecessor.\r\n\r\n5. The transmission of characters acquired during the lifetime of the\r\nparent. This is suggested in the following crude way:\r\n\r\n  \"Thirdly, when we enumerate the great changes produced in the\r\n  species of animals before their maturity, as, for example, when the\r\n  offspring reproduces the effects produced upon the parent by\r\n  accident or cultivation; or the changes produced by the mixture of\r\n  species, as in mules; or the changes produced probably by the\r\n  exuberance of nourishment supplied to the fetus, as in monstrous\r\n  births with additional limbs, many of these enormities of shape are\r\n  propagated and continued as a variety, at least, if not as a new\r\n  species of animal. I have seen a breed of cats with an additional\r\n  claw on every foot; of poultry also with an additional claw, and\r\n  with wings to their feet, and of others without rumps. Mr. Buffon\r\n  mentions a breed of dogs without tails, which are common at Rome and\r\n  Naples, which he supposes to have been produced by a custom, long\r\n  established, of cutting their tails close off. There are many kinds\r\n  of pigeons admired for their peculiarities which are more or less\r\n  thus produced and propagated.\"[154]\r\n\r\n6. The means of procuring food has, he says, \"diversified the forms of\r\nall species of animals. Thus the nose of the swine has become hard for\r\nthe purpose of turning up the soil in search of insects and of roots.\r\nThe trunk of the elephant is an elongation of the nose for the purpose\r\nof pulling down the branches of trees for his food, and for taking up\r\nwater without bending his knees. Beasts of prey have acquired strong\r\njaws or talons. Cattle have acquired a rough tongue and a rough palate\r\nto pull off the blades of grass, as cows and sheep. Some birds have\r\nacquired harder beaks to crack nuts, as the parrot. Others have acquired\r\nbeaks to break the harder seeds, as sparrows. Others for the softer\r\nkinds of flowers, or the buds of trees, as the finches. Other birds have\r\nacquired long beaks to penetrate the moister soils in search of insects\r\nor roots, as woodcocks, and others broad ones to filtrate the water of\r\nlakes and to retain aquatic insects. All which seem to have been\r\ngradually produced during many generations by the perpetual endeavors of\r\nthe creature to supply the want of food, and to have been delivered to\r\ntheir posterity with constant improvement of them for the purpose\r\nrequired\" (p. 238).\r\n\r\n7. The third great want among animals is that of security, which seems\r\nto have diversified the forms of their bodies and the color of them;\r\nthese consist in the means of escaping other animals more powerful than\r\nthemselves.[155] Hence some animals have acquired wings instead of legs,\r\nas the smaller birds, for purposes of escape. Others, great length of\r\nfin or of membrane, as the flying-fish and the bat. Others have acquired\r\nhard or armed shells, as the tortoise and the Echinus marinus (p. 239).\r\n\r\n  \"The colors of insects,\" he says, \"and many smaller animals\r\n  contribute to conceal them from the dangers which prey upon them.\r\n  Caterpillars which feed on leaves are generally green; earthworms\r\n  the color of the earth which they inhabit; butterflies, which\r\n  frequent flowers, are colored like them; small birds which frequent\r\n  hedges have greenish backs like the leaves, and light-colored\r\n  bellies like the sky, and are hence less visible to the hawk, who\r\n  passes under them or over them. Those birds which are much amongst\r\n  flowers, as the goldfinch (_Fringilla carduelis_), are furnished\r\n  with vivid colors. The lark, partridge, hare, are the color of dry\r\n  vegetables or earth on which they rest. And frogs vary their color\r\n  with the mud of the streams which they frequent; and those which\r\n  live on trees are green. Fish, which are generally suspended in\r\n  water, and swallows, which are generally suspended in air, have\r\n  their backs the color of the distant ground, and their bellies of\r\n  the sky. In the colder climates many of these become white during\r\n  the existence of the snows. Hence there is apparent design in the\r\n  colors of animals, whilst those of vegetables seem consequent to\r\n  the other properties of the materials which possess them\" (_The\r\n  Loves of the Plants_, p. 38, note).\r\n\r\nIn his _Zoonomia_ (§ xxxix., vi.) Darwin also speaks of the efficient\r\ncause of the various colors of the eggs of birds and of the hair and\r\nfeathers of animals which are adapted to the purpose of concealment.\r\n\"Thus the snake, and wild cat, and leopard are so colored as to resemble\r\ndark leaves and their light interstices\" (p. 248). The eggs of\r\nhedge-birds are greenish, with dark spots; those of crows and magpies,\r\nwhich are seen from beneath through wicker nests, are white, with dark\r\nspots; and those of larks and partridges are russet or brown, like their\r\nnests or situations. He adds: \"The final cause of their colors is easily\r\nunderstood, as they serve some purpose of the animal, but the efficient\r\ncause would seem almost beyond conjecture.\" Of all this subject of\r\nprotective mimicry thus sketched out by the older Darwin, we find no\r\nhint or trace in any of Lamarck's writings.\r\n\r\n8. Great length of time. He speaks of the \"great length of time since\r\nthe earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the\r\ncommencement of the history of mankind\" (p. 240).\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be observed that Dr. Darwin emphatically\r\nopposes the preformation views of Haller and Bonnet in these words:\r\n\r\n  \"Many ingenious philosophers have found so great difficulty in\r\n  conceiving the manner of the reproduction of animals that they have\r\n  supposed all the numerous progeny to have existed in miniature in\r\n  the animal originally created, and that these infinitely minute\r\n  forms are only evolved or distended as the embryon increases in the\r\n  womb. This idea, besides being unsupported by any analogy we are\r\n  acquainted with, ascribes a greater tenuity to organized matter than\r\n  we can readily admit\" (p. 317); and in another place he claims that\r\n  \"we cannot but be convinced that the fetus or embryon is formed by\r\n  apposition of new parts, and not by the distention of a primordial\r\n  nest of germs included one within another like the cups of a\r\n  conjurer\" (p. 235).\r\n\r\n9. To explain instinct he suggests that the young simply imitate the\r\nacts or example of their parents. He says that wild birds choose spring\r\nas their building time \"from the acquired knowledge that the mild\r\ntemperature of the air is more convenient for hatching their eggs;\" and\r\nfurther on, referring to the fact that seed-eating animals generally\r\nproduce their young in spring, he suggests that it is \"part of the\r\ntraditional knowledge which they learn from the example of their\r\nparents.\"[156]\r\n\r\n10. Hybridity. He refers in a cursory way to the changes produced by the\r\nmixture of species, as in mules.\r\n\r\nOf these ten factors or principles, and other views of Dr. Darwin, some\r\nare similar to those of Lamarck, while others are directly opposed.\r\nThere are therefore no good grounds for supposing that Lamarck was\r\nindebted to Darwin for his views. Thus Erasmus Darwin supposes that the\r\nformation of organs precedes their use. As he says, \"The lungs must be\r\npreviously formed before their exertions to obtain fresh air can exist;\r\nthe throat or oesophagus must be formed previous to the sensation or\r\nappetites of hunger and thirst\" (_Zoonomia_, p. 222). Again (_Zoonomia_,\r\ni., p. 498), \"From hence I conclude that with the acquisition of new\r\nparts, new sensations and new desires, as well as new powers, are\r\nproduced\" (p. 226). Lamarck does not carry his doctrine of\r\nuse-inheritance so far as Erasmus Darwin, who claimed, what some still\r\nmaintain at the present day, that the offspring reproduces \"the effects\r\nproduced upon the parent by accident or cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea that all animals have descended from a similar living filament\r\nis expressed in a more modern and scientific way by Lamarck, who derived\r\nthem from monads.\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus Darwin way of stating that the transformations of animals\r\nare in part produced by their own exertions in consequence of their\r\ndesires and aversions, etc., is stated in a quite different way by\r\nLamarck.\r\n\r\nFinally the principle of law of battle, or the combat between the males\r\nfor the possession of the females, with the result \"that the strongest\r\nand most active animal should propagate the species,\" is not hinted at\r\nby Lamarck. This view, on the contrary, is one of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the doctrine of natural selection, and was made use of by\r\nCharles Darwin and others. So also Erasmus anticipated Charles Darwin in\r\nthe third great want of \"security,\" in seeking which the forms and\r\ncolors of animals have been modified. This is an anticipation of the\r\nprinciple of protective mimicry, so much discussed in these days by\r\nDarwin, Wallace, and others, and which was not even mentioned by\r\nLamarck. From the internal evidence of Lamarck's writings we therefore\r\ninfer that he was in no way indebted to Erasmus Darwin for any hints or\r\nideas.[157]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[152] Vol. ii., 3d edition. Our references are to this edition.\r\n\r\n[153] Krause, _The Scientific Works of Erasmus Darwin_, footnote on\r\np. 134: \"See 'Athenæum,' March, 1875, p. 423.\"\r\n\r\n[154] _Zoonomia_, i., p. 505 (3d edition, p. 335).\r\n\r\n[155] The subject of protective mimicry is more explicitly stated by\r\nDr. Darwin in his earlier book, _The Loves of the Plants_, and, as\r\nKrause states, though Rösel von Rosenhof in his _Insekten-Belustigungen_\r\n(Nurnberg, 1746) describes the resemblance which geometric caterpillars,\r\nand also certain moths when in repose, present to dry twigs, and thus\r\nconceal themselves, \"this group of phenomena seems to have been first\r\nregarded from a more general point of view by Dr. Darwin.\"\r\n\r\n[156] _Zoonomia_, vol. i., p. 170.\r\n\r\n[157] Mr. Samuel Butler, in his _Evolution, Old and New_, taking it for\r\ngranted that Lamarck was \"a partisan of immutability till 1801,\"\r\nintimates that \"the secret of this sudden conversion must be found in a\r\nFrench translation by M. Deleuze of Dr. Darwin's poem, _The Loves of the\r\nPlants_, which appeared in 1800. Lamarck--the most eminent botanist of\r\nhis time--was sure to have heard of and seen this, and would probably\r\nknow the translator, who would be able to give him a fair idea of the\r\n_Zoonomia_\" (p. 258).\r\n\r\nBut this notion seems disproved by the fact that Lamarck delivered his\r\nfamous lecture, published in 1801, during the last of April or in the\r\nfirst half of May, 1800. The views then presented must have been formed\r\nin his mind at least for some time--perhaps a year or more--previous,\r\nand were the result of no sudden inspiration, least of all from any\r\ninformation given him by Deleuze, whom he probably never met. If Lamarck\r\nhad actually seen and read the _Zoonomia_ he would have been manly\r\nenough to have given him credit for any novel ideas. Besides that, as we\r\nhave already seen, the internal evidence shows that Lamarck's views were\r\nin some important points entirely different from those of Erasmus\r\nDarwin, and were conceptions original with the French zoölogist.\r\n\r\nKrause in his excellent essay on the scientific works of Erasmus Darwin\r\n(1879) refers to Lamarck as \"evidently a disciple of Darwin,\" stating\r\nthat Lamarck worked out \"in all directions\" Erasmus Darwin's principles\r\nof \"will and active efforts\" (p. 212).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWHEN DID LAMARCK CHANGE HIS VIEWS REGARDING THE MUTABILITY OF SPECIES?\r\n\r\n\r\nLamarck's mind was essentially philosophical. He was given to inquiring\r\ninto the causes and origin of things. When thirty-two years old he wrote\r\nhis \"Researches on the Causes of the Principal Physical Facts,\" though\r\nthis work did not appear from the press until 1794, when he was fifty\r\nyears of age. In this treatise he inquires into the origin of compounds\r\nand of minerals; also he conceived that all the rocks as well as all\r\nchemical compounds and minerals originated from organic life. These\r\ninquiries were reiterated in his \"Memoirs on Physics and Natural\r\nHistory,\" which appeared in 1797, when he was fifty-three years old.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of philosophic France, as well as of England and Germany\r\nin the eighteenth century, was charged with inquiries into the origin of\r\nthings material, though more especially of things immaterial. It was a\r\nperiod of energetic thinking. Whether Lamarck had read the works of\r\nthese philosophers or not we have no means of knowing. Buffon, we know,\r\nwas influenced by Leibnitz.\r\n\r\nDid Buffon's guarded suggestions have no influence on the young Lamarck?\r\nHe enjoyed his friendship and patronage in early life, frequenting his\r\nhouse, and was for a time the travelling companion of Buffon's son. It\r\nshould seem most natural that he would have been personally influenced\r\nby his great predecessor, but we see no indubitable trace of such\r\ninfluence in his writings. Lamarckism is not Buffonism. It comprises in\r\nthe main quite a different, more varied and comprehensive set of\r\nfactors.[158]\r\n\r\nWas Lamarck influenced by the biological writings of Haller, Bonnet, or\r\nby the philosophic views of Condillac, whose _Essai sur l'Origine des\r\nConnaissances humaines_ appeared in 1786; or of Condorcet, whom he must\r\npersonally have known, and whose _Esquisse d'un Tableau historique des\r\nProgrès de l'Esprit humain_ was published in 1794?[159] In one case only\r\nin Lamarck's works do we find reference to these thinkers.\r\n\r\nWas Lamarck, as the result of his botanical studies from 1768 to 1793,\r\nand being puzzled, as systematic botanists are, by the variations of the\r\nmore plastic species of plants, led to deny the fixity of species?\r\n\r\nWe have been unable to find any indications of a change of views in his\r\nbotanical writings, though his papers are prefaced by philosophical\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed be interesting to know what led Lamarck to change his\r\nviews. Without any explanation as to the reason from his own pen, we\r\nare led to suppose that his studies on the invertebrates, his perception\r\nof the gradations in the animal scale from monad to man, together with\r\nhis inherent propensity to inquire into the origin of things, also his\r\nstudies on fossils, as well as the broadening nature of his zoölogical\r\ninvestigations and his meditations during the closing years of the\r\neighteenth century, must gradually have led to a change of views.\r\n\r\nIt was said by Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire that Lamarck was \"long a\r\npartisan of the immutability of species,\"[160] but the use of the word\r\n\"partisan\" appears to be quite incorrect, as he only in one instance\r\nexpresses such views.\r\n\r\nThe only place where we have seen any statement of Lamarck's earlier\r\nopinions is in his _Recherches sur les Causes des principaux Faits\r\nphysiques_, which was written, as the \"advertisement\" states, \"about\r\neighteen years\" before its publication in 1794. The treatise was\r\nactually presented April 22, 1780, to the Académie des Sciences.[161] It\r\nwill be seen by the following passages, which we translate, that, as\r\nHuxley states, this view presents a striking contrast to those to be\r\nfound in the _Philosophie zoologique_:\r\n\r\n  \"685. Although my sole object in this article [article premier,\r\n  p. 188] has only been to treat of the physical cause of the\r\n  maintenance of life of organic beings, still I have ventured to urge\r\n  at the outset that the existence of these astonishing beings by no\r\n  means depends on nature; that all which is meant by the word nature\r\n  cannot give life--namely, that all the faculties of matter, added to\r\n  all possible circumstances, and even to the activity pervading the\r\n  universe, cannot produce a being endowed with the power of organic\r\n  movement, capable of reproducing its like, and subject to death.\r\n\r\n  \"686. All the individuals of this nature which exist are derived\r\n  from similar individuals, which, all taken together, constitute the\r\n  entire species. However, I believe that it is as impossible for man\r\n  to know the physical origin of the first individual of each species\r\n  as to assign also physically the cause of the existence of matter or\r\n  of the whole universe. This is at least what the result of my\r\n  knowledge and reflection leads me to think. If there exist any\r\n  varieties produced by the action of circumstances, these varieties\r\n  do not change the nature of the species (_ces variétés ne dénaturent\r\n  point les espèces_); but doubtless we are often deceived in\r\n  indicating as a species what is only a variety; and I perceive that\r\n  this error may be of consequence in reasoning on this subject\"\r\n  (tome ii., pp. 213-214).\r\n\r\nIt must apparently remain a matter of uncertainty whether this opinion,\r\nso decisively stated, was that of Lamarck at thirty-two years of age,\r\nand which he allowed to remain, as then stated, for eighteen years, or\r\nwhether he inserted it when reading the proofs in 1794. It would seem as\r\nif it were the expression of his views when a botanist and a young man.\r\n\r\nIn his _Mémoires de Physique et d'Histoire naturelle_, which was\r\npublished in 1797, there is nothing said bearing on the stability of\r\nspecies, and though his work is largely a repetition of the\r\n_Recherches_, the author omits the passages quoted above. Was this\r\nperiod of six years, between 1794 and 1800, given to a reconsideration\r\nof the subject resulting in favor of the doctrine of descent?\r\n\r\nHuxley quotes these passages, and then in a footnote (p. 211), after\r\nstating that Lamarck's _Recherches_ was not published before 1794, and\r\nstating that at that time it presumably expressed Lamarck's mature\r\nviews, adds: \"It would be interesting to know what brought about the\r\nchange of opinion manifested in the _Recherches sur l'Organisation des\r\nCorps vivans_, published only seven years later.\"\r\n\r\nIn the appendix to this book (1802) he thus refers to his change of\r\nviews: \"I have for a long time thought that _species_ were constant in\r\nnature, and that they were constituted by the individuals which belong\r\nto each of them. I am now convinced that I was in error in this respect,\r\nand that in reality only individuals exist in nature\" (p. 141).\r\n\r\nSome clew in answer to the question as to when Lamarck changed his views\r\nis afforded by an almost casual statement by Lamarck in the addition\r\nentitled _Sur les Fossiles_ to his _Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres_\r\n(1801), where, after speaking of fossils as extremely valuable monuments\r\nfor the study of the revolutions the earth has passed through at\r\ndifferent regions on its surface, and of the changes living beings have\r\nthere themselves successively undergone, he adds in parenthesis: \"_Dans\r\nmes leçons j'ai toujours insiste sur ces considérations._\" Are we to\r\ninfer from this that these evolutionary views were expressed in his\r\nfirst course, or in one of the earlier courses of zoölogical\r\nlectures--_i.e._, soon after his appointment in 1793--and if not then,\r\nat least one or two, or perhaps several, years before the year 1800? For\r\neven if the change in his views were comparatively sudden, he must have\r\nmeditated upon the subject for months and even, perhaps, years, before\r\nfinally committing himself to these views in print. So strong and bold a\r\nthinker as Lamarck had already shown himself in these fields of thought,\r\nand one so inflexible and unyielding in holding to an opinion once\r\nformed as he, must have arrived at such views only after long\r\nreflection. There is also every reason to suppose that Lamarck's theory\r\nof descent was conceived by himself alone, from the evidence which lay\r\nbefore him in the plants and animals he had so well studied for the\r\npreceding thirty years, and that his inspiration came directly from\r\nnature and not from Buffon, and least of all from the writings of\r\nErasmus Darwin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158] See the comparative summary of the views of the founders of\r\nevolution at the end of Chapter XVII.\r\n\r\n[159] While Rousseau was living at Montmorency \"his thought wandered\r\nconfusedly round the notion of a treatise to be called 'Sensitive\r\nMorality or the Materialism of the Age,' the object of which was to\r\nexamine the influence of external agencies, such as light, darkness,\r\nsound, seasons, food, noise, silence, motion, rest, on our corporeal\r\nmachine, and thus, indirectly, upon the soul also.\"--_Rousseau_, by John\r\nMorley (p. 164).\r\n\r\n[160] Butler's _Evolution, Old and New_ (p. 244), and Isidore Geoffroy\r\nSt. Hilaire's _Histoire naturelle générale_, tome ii., p. 404 (1859).\r\n\r\n[161] After looking in vain through both volumes of the _Recherches_ for\r\nsome expression of Lamarck's earlier views, I found a mention of it in\r\nOsborn's _From the Greeks to Darwin_, p. 152, and reference to Huxley's\r\n_Evolution in Biology_, 1878 (\"Darwiniana,\" p. 210), where the\r\nparagraphs translated above are quoted in the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE STEPS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAMARCK'S VIEWS ON EVOLUTION BEFORE THE\r\nPUBLICATION OF HIS _PHILOSOPHIE ZOOLOGIQUE_\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _From the Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres_ (1801).\r\n\r\nThe first occasion on which, so far as his published writings show,\r\nLamarck expressed his evolutional views was in the opening lecture[162]\r\nof his course on the invertebrate animals delivered in the spring of\r\n1800, and published in 1801 as a preface to his _Système des Animaux\r\nsans Vertèbres_, this being the first sketch or prodromus of his later\r\ngreat work on the invertebrate animals. In the preface of this book,\r\nreferring to the opening lecture, he says: \"I have glanced at some\r\nimportant and philosophic views that the nature and limits of this work\r\ndo not permit me to develop, but which I propose to take up elsewhere\r\nwith the details necessary to show on what facts they are based, and\r\nwith certain explanations which would prevent any one from\r\nmisunderstanding them.\" It may be inferred from this that he had for\r\nsome time previous meditated on this theme. It will now be interesting\r\nto see what factors of evolution Lamarck employed in this first sketch\r\nof his theory.\r\n\r\nAfter stating the distinctions existing between the vertebrate and\r\ninvertebrate animals, and referring to the great diversity of animal\r\nforms, he goes on to say that Nature began with the most simply\r\norganized, and having formed them, \"then with the aid of much time and\r\nof favorable circumstances she formed all the others.\"\r\n\r\n  \"It appears, as I have already said, that _time_ and _favorable\r\n  conditions_ are the two principal means which nature has employed in\r\n  giving existence to all her productions. We know that for her time\r\n  has no limit, and that consequently she has it always at her\r\n  disposal.\r\n\r\n  \"As to the circumstances of which she has had need and of which she\r\n  makes use every day in order to cause her productions to vary, we\r\n  can say that they are in a manner inexhaustible.\r\n\r\n  \"The essential ones arise from the influence and from all the\r\n  environing media (_milieux_), from the diversity of local causes\r\n  (_diversité des lieux_), of habits, of movements, of action, finally\r\n  of means of living, of preserving their lives, of defending\r\n  themselves, of multiplying themselves, etc. Moreover, as the result\r\n  of these different influences the faculties, developed and\r\n  strengthened by use (_usage_), became diversified by the new habits\r\n  maintained for long ages, and by slow degrees the structure, the\r\n  consistence, in a word the nature, the condition of the parts and of\r\n  the organs consequently participating in all these influences,\r\n  became preserved and were propagated by generation.[163]\r\n\r\n  \"The bird which necessity (_besoin_) drives to the water to find\r\n  there the prey needed for its subsistence separates the toes of its\r\n  feet when it wishes to strike the water[164] and move on its\r\n  surface. The skin, which unites these toes at their base, contracts\r\n  in this way the habit of extending itself. Thus in time the broad\r\n  membranes which connect the toes of ducks, geese, etc., are formed\r\n  in the way indicated.\r\n\r\n  \"But one accustomed to live perched on trees has necessarily the end\r\n  of the toes lengthened and shaped in another way. Its claws are\r\n  elongated, sharpened, and are curved and bent so as to seize the\r\n  branches on which it so often rests.\r\n\r\n  \"Likewise we perceive that the shore bird, which does not care to\r\n  swim, but which, however, is obliged (a _besoin_) to approach the\r\n  water to obtain its prey, will be continually in danger of sinking\r\n  in the mud, but wishing to act so that its body shall not fall into\r\n  the liquid, it will contract the habit of extending and lengthening\r\n  its feet. Hence it will result in the generations of these birds\r\n  which continue to live in this manner, that the individuals will\r\n  find themselves raised as if on stilts, on long naked feet; namely,\r\n  denuded of feathers up to and often above the thighs.\r\n\r\n  \"I could here pass in review all the classes, all the orders, all\r\n  the genera and species of animals which exist, and make it apparent\r\n  that the conformation of individuals and of their parts, their\r\n  organs, their faculties, etc., is entirely the result of\r\n  circumstances to which the race of each species has been subjected\r\n  by nature.\r\n\r\n  \"I could prove that it is not the form either of the body or of its\r\n  parts which gives rise to habits, to the mode of life of animals,\r\n  but, on the contrary, it is the habits, the mode of life, and all\r\n  the influential circumstances which have, with time, made up the\r\n  form of the body and of the parts of animals. With the new forms new\r\n  faculties have been acquired, and gradually nature has reached the\r\n  state in which we actually see her\" (pp. 12-15).\r\n\r\nHe then points out the gradation which exists from the most simple\r\nanimal up to the most composite, since from the monad, which, so to\r\nspeak, is only an animated point, up to the mammals, and from them up to\r\nman, there is evidently a shaded gradation in the structure of all the\r\nanimals. So also among the plants there is a graduated series from the\r\nsimplest, such as _Mucor viridescens_, up to the most complicated plant.\r\nBut he hastens to say that by this regular gradation in the complication\r\nof the organization he does not mean to infer the existence of a linear\r\nseries, with regular intervals between the species and genera:\r\n\r\n  \"Such a series does not exist; but I speak of a series almost\r\n  regularly graduated in the principal groups (_masses_) such as the\r\n  great families; series most assuredly existing, both among animals\r\n  and among plants, but which, as regards genera and especially\r\n  species, form in many places lateral ramifications, whose\r\n  extremities offer truly isolated points.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the first time in the history of biological science that we have\r\nstated in so scientific, broad, and modern form the essential\r\nprinciples of evolution. Lamarck insists that time without limit and\r\nfavorable conditions are the two principal means or factors in the\r\nproduction of plants and animals. Under the head of favorable conditions\r\nhe enumerates variations in climate, temperature, the action of the\r\nenvironment, the diversity of local causes, change of habits, movement,\r\naction, variation in means of living, of preservation of life, of means\r\nof defence, and varying modes of reproduction. As the result of the\r\naction of these different factors, the faculties of animals, developed\r\nand strengthened by use, become diversified by the new habits, so that\r\nby slow degrees the new structures and organs thus arising become\r\npreserved and transmitted by heredity.\r\n\r\nIn this address it should be noticed that nothing is said of willing and\r\nof internal feeling, which have been so much misunderstood and\r\nridiculed, or of the direct or indirect action of the environment. He\r\ndoes speak of the bird as wishing to strike the water, but this,\r\nliberally interpreted, is as much a physiological impulse as a mental\r\ndesire. No reference also is made to geographical isolation, a factor\r\nwhich he afterwards briefly mentioned.\r\n\r\nAlthough Lamarck does not mention the principle of selection, he refers\r\nin the following way to competition, or at least to the checks on the\r\ntoo rapid multiplication of the lower invertebrates:\r\n\r\n  \"So were it not for the immense consumption as food which is made in\r\n  nature of animals which compose the lower orders of the animal\r\n  kingdom, these animals would soon overpower and perhaps destroy, by\r\n  their enormous numbers, the more highly organized and perfect\r\n  animals which compose the first classes and the first orders of this\r\n  kingdom, so great is the difference in the means and facility of\r\n  multiplying between the two.\r\n\r\n  \"But nature has anticipated the dangerous effects of this vast power\r\n  of reproduction and multiplication. She has prevented it on the one\r\n  hand by considerably limiting the duration of life of these beings\r\n  so simply organized which compose the lower classes, and especially\r\n  the lowest orders of the animal kingdom. On the other hand, both by\r\n  making these animals the prey of each other, thus incessantly\r\n  reducing their numbers, and also by determining through the\r\n  diversity of climates the localities where they could exist, and by\r\n  the variety of seasons--_i.e._, by the influences of different\r\n  atmospheric conditions--the time during which they could maintain\r\n  their existence.\r\n\r\n  \"By means of these wise precautions of nature everything is well\r\n  balanced and in order. Individuals multiply, propagate, and die in\r\n  different ways. No species predominates up to the point of effecting\r\n  the extinction of another, except, perhaps, in the highest classes,\r\n  where the multiplication of the individuals is slow and difficult;\r\n  and as the result of this state of things we conceive that in\r\n  general species are preserved\" (p. 22).\r\n\r\nHere we have in anticipation the doctrine of Malthus, which, as will be\r\nremembered, so much impressed Charles Darwin, and led him in part to\r\nwork out his principle of natural selection.\r\n\r\nThe author then taking up other subjects, first asserts that among the\r\nchanges that animals and plants unceasingly bring about by their\r\nproduction and _débris_, it is not the largest and most perfect animals\r\nwhich have caused the most considerable changes, but rather the coral\r\npolyps, etc.[165] He then, after dilating on the value of the study of\r\nthe invertebrate animals, proceeds to define them, and closes his\r\nlecture by describing the seven classes into which he divides this\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps vivans, 1802 (Opening\r\nDiscourse)._\r\n\r\nThe following is an abstract with translations of the most important\r\npassages relating to evolution:\r\n\r\nThat the portion of the animal kingdom treated in these lectures\r\ncomprises more species than all the other groups taken together is,\r\nhowever, the least of those considerations which should interest my\r\nhearers.\r\n\r\n  \"It is the group containing the most curious forms, the richest in\r\n  marvels of every kind, the most astonishing, especially from the\r\n  singular facts of organization that they present, though it is that\r\n  hitherto the least considered under these grand points of view.\r\n\r\n  \"How much better than learning the names and characters of all the\r\n  species is it to learn of the origin, relation, and mode of\r\n  existence of all the natural productions with which we are\r\n  surrounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_First Part: Progress in structure of living beings in proportion\r\n  as circumstances favor them._\r\n\r\n  \"When we give continued attention to the examination of the\r\n  organization of different living beings, to that of different\r\n  systems which this organization presents in each organic kingdom,\r\n  finally to certain changes which are seen to be undergone in certain\r\n  circumstances, we are convinced:\r\n\r\n  \"1. That the nature of organic movement is not only to develop the\r\n  organization but also to multiply the organs and to fulfil the\r\n  functions, and that at the outset this organic movement continually\r\n  tends to restrict to functions special to certain parts the\r\n  functions which were at first general--_i.e._, common to all parts\r\n  of the body;\r\n\r\n  \"2. That the result of _nutrition_ is not only to supply to the\r\n  developing organization what the organic movement tends to form, but\r\n  besides, also by a forced inequality between the matters which are\r\n  assimilated and those which are dissipated by losses, this function\r\n  at a certain term of the duration of life causes a progressive\r\n  deterioration of the organs, so that as a necessary consequence it\r\n  inevitably causes death;\r\n\r\n  \"3. That the property of the movement of the fluids in the parts\r\n  which contain them is to break out passages, places of deposit, and\r\n  outlets; to there create canals and consequently different organs;\r\n  to cause these canals, as well as the organs, to vary on account of\r\n  the diversity both of the movements and of the nature of the fluids\r\n  which give rise to them; finally to enlarge, elongate, to gradually\r\n  divide and solidify [the walls of] these canals and these organs by\r\n  the matters which form and incessantly separate the fluids which are\r\n  there in movement, and one part of which is assimilated and added to\r\n  the organs, while the other is rejected and cast out;\r\n\r\n  \"4. That the state of organization in each organism has been\r\n  gradually acquired by the progress of the influences of the movement\r\n  of fluids, and by those changes that these fluids have there\r\n  continually undergone in their nature and their condition through\r\n  the habitual succession of their losses and of their renewals;\r\n\r\n  \"5. That each organization and each form acquired by this course of\r\n  things and by the circumstances which there have concurred, were\r\n  preserved and transmitted successively by generation [heredity]\r\n  until new modifications of these organizations and of these forms\r\n  have been acquired by the same means and by new circumstances;\r\n\r\n  \"6. Finally, that from the uninterrupted concurrence of these causes\r\n  or from these laws of nature, together with much time and with an\r\n  almost inconceivable diversity of influential circumstances, organic\r\n  beings of all the orders have been successively formed.\r\n\r\n  \"Considerations so extraordinary, relatively to the ideas that the\r\n  vulgar have generally formed on the nature and origin of living\r\n  bodies, will be naturally regarded by you as stretches of the\r\n  imagination unless I hasten to lay before you some observations and\r\n  facts which supply the most complete evidence.\r\n\r\n  \"From the point of view of knowledge based on observation the\r\n  philosophic naturalist feels convinced that it is in that which is\r\n  called the lowest classes of the two organic kingdoms--_i.e._, in\r\n  those which comprise the most simply organized beings--that we can\r\n  collect facts the most luminous and observations the most decisive\r\n  on the _production_ and the reproduction of the living beings in\r\n  question; on the causes of the formation of the organs of these\r\n  wonderful beings; and on those of their developments, of their\r\n  diversity and their multiplicity, which increase with the concourse\r\n  of generations, of times, and of influential circumstances.\r\n\r\n  \"Hence we may be assured that it is only among the singular beings\r\n  of these lowest classes, and especially in the lowest orders of\r\n  these classes, that it is possible to find on both sides the\r\n  primitive germs of life, and consequently the germs of the most\r\n  important faculties of animality and vegetality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modification of the organization from one end to the other of the\r\nanimal chain._\r\n\r\n\"One is forced,\" he says, \"to recognize that the totality of existing\r\nanimals constitute _a series of groups_ forming a true chain, and that\r\nthere exists from one end to the other of this chain a gradual\r\nmodification in the structure of the animals composing it, as also a\r\nproportionate diminution in the number of faculties of these animals\r\nfrom the highest to the lowest (the first germs), these being without\r\ndoubt the form with which nature began, with the aid of much time and\r\nfavorable circumstances, to form all the others.\"\r\n\r\nHe then begins with the mammals and descends to molluscs, annelids, and\r\ninsects, down to the polyps, \"as it is better to proceed from the known\r\nto the unknown;\" but farther on (p. 38) he finally remarks:\r\n\r\n  \"Ascend from the most simple to the most compound, depart from the\r\n  most imperfect animalcule and ascend along the scale up to the\r\n  animal richest in structure and faculties; constantly preserve the\r\n  order of relation in the group, then you will hold the true thread\r\n  which connects all the productions of nature; you will have a just\r\n  idea of its progress, and you will be convinced that the most simple\r\n  of its living productions have successively given existence to all\r\n  the others.\r\n\r\n  \"_The series which constitutes the animal scale resides in the\r\n  distribution of the groups, and not in that of the individuals and\r\n  species._\r\n\r\n  \"I have already said[166] that by this shaded graduation in the\r\n  complication of structure I do not mean to speak of the existence\r\n  of a linear and regular series of species or even genera: such a\r\n  series does not exist. But I speak of a quite regularly graduated\r\n  series in the principal groups, _i.e._, in the principal system of\r\n  organizations known, which give rise to classes and to great\r\n  families, series most assuredly existing both among animals and\r\n  plants, although in the consideration of genera, and especially in\r\n  that of species, it offers many lateral ramifications whose\r\n  extremities are truly isolated points.\r\n\r\n  \"However, although there has been denied, in a very modern work, the\r\n  existence in the animal kingdom of a single series, natural and at\r\n  the same time graduated, in the composition of the organization of\r\n  beings which it comprehends, series in truth necessarily formed of\r\n  groups subordinated to each other as regards structure and not of\r\n  isolated species or genera, I ask where is the well-informed\r\n  naturalist who would now present a different order in the\r\n  arrangement of the twelve classes of the animal kingdom of which I\r\n  have just given an account?\r\n\r\n  \"I have already stated what I think of this view, which has seemed\r\n  sublime to some moderns, and indorsed by _Professor Hermann_.\"\r\n\r\nEach distinct group or mass of forms has, he says, its peculiar system\r\nof essential organs, but each organ considered by itself does not follow\r\nas regular a course in its degradations (modifications).\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, the least important organs, or those least essential to\r\n  life, are not always in relation to each other in their improvement\r\n  or their degradation; and an organ which in one species is atrophied\r\n  may be very perfect in another. These irregular variations in the\r\n  perfecting and in the degradation of non-essential organs are due to\r\n  the fact that these organs are oftener than the others submitted to\r\n  the influences of external circumstances, and give rise to a\r\n  diversity of species so considerable and so singularly ordered that\r\n  instead of being able to arrange them, like the groups, in a single\r\n  simple linear series under the form of a regular graduated scale,\r\n  these very species often form around the groups of which they are\r\n  part lateral ramifications, the extremities of which offer points\r\n  truly isolated.\r\n\r\n  \"There is needed, in order to change each internal system of\r\n  organization, a combination of more influential circumstances, and\r\n  of more prolonged duration than to alter and modify the external\r\n  organs.\r\n\r\n  \"I have observed, however, that, when circumstances demand, nature\r\n  passes from one system to another without making a leap, provided\r\n  they are allies. It is, indeed, by this faculty that she has come to\r\n  form them all in succession, in proceeding from the simple to the\r\n  more complex.\r\n\r\n  \"It is so true that she has the power, that she passes from one\r\n  system to the other, not only in two different families which are\r\n  allied, but she also passes from one system to the other in the same\r\n  individual.\r\n\r\n  \"The systems of organization which admit as organs of respiration\r\n  true lungs are nearer to systems which admit gills than those which\r\n  require tracheæ. Thus not only does nature pass from gills to lungs\r\n  in allied classes and families, as seen in fishes and reptiles, but\r\n  in the latter she passes even during the life of the same\r\n  individual, which successively possesses each system. We know that\r\n  the frog in the tadpole state respires by gills, while in the more\r\n  perfect state of frog it respires by lungs. We never see that nature\r\n  passes from a system with tracheæ to a system with lungs.\r\n\r\n  \"_It is not the organs, i.e., the nature and form of the parts of\r\n  the body of an animal, which give rise to the special habits and\r\n  faculties, but, on the contrary, its habits, its mode of life, and\r\n  the circumstances in which individuals are placed, which have, with\r\n  time, brought about the form of its body, the number and condition\r\n  of its organs, finally the faculties which it possesses._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Time and favorable circumstances are the two principal means which\r\n  nature employs to give existence to all her productions.

It is also very easy to prove that the\r\n  constant lack of exercise of an organ gradually reduces it and ends\r\n  by atrophying it.\"\r\n\r\nThen follow the facts regarding the mole, spalax, ant-eater, and the\r\nlack of teeth in birds, the origin of shore birds, swimming birds and\r\nperching birds, which are stated farther on.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus the efforts in any direction, maintained for a long time or\r\n  made habitually by certain parts of a living body, to satisfy the\r\n  needs called out (_exigés_) by nature or by circumstances, develop\r\n  these parts and cause them to acquire dimensions and a form which\r\n  they never would have obtained if these efforts had not become an\r\n  habitual action of the animals which have exercised them.\r\n  Observations made on all the animals known would furnish examples of\r\n  this.\r\n\r\n  \"When the will determines an animal to any kind of action, the\r\n  organs whose function it is to execute this action are then\r\n  immediately provoked by the flowing there of subtile fluids, which\r\n  become the determining cause of movements which perform the action\r\n  in question. A multitude of observations support this fact, which\r\n  now no one would doubt.\r\n\r\n  \"It results from this that multiplied repetitions of these acts of\r\n  organization strengthen, extend, develop, and even create the organs\r\n  which are there needed.

Everything, after a\r\n  while, undergoes different changes, more or less prompt, according\r\n  to the nature of the objects and of circumstances. Elevated areas\r\n  are constantly being lowered, and the loose material carried down to\r\n  the lowlands. The beds of rivers, of streams, of even the sea, are\r\n  gradually removed and changed, as also the climate;[167] in a word,\r\n  the whole surface of the earth gradually undergoes a change in\r\n  situation, form, nature, and aspect. We see on every hand what\r\n  ascertained facts prove; it is only necessary to observe and to give\r\n  one's attention to be convinced of it.\r\n\r\n  \"However, if, relatively to living beings, the diversity of\r\n  circumstances brings about for them a diversity of habits, a\r\n  different mode of existence, and, as the result, modifications in\r\n  their organs and in the shape of their parts, one should believe\r\n  that very gradually every living body whatever would vary in its\r\n  organization and its form.\r\n\r\n  \"All the modifications that each living being will have undergone as\r\n  the result of change of circumstances which have influenced its\r\n  nature will doubtless be propagated by heredity (_génération_). But\r\n  as new modifications will necessarily continue to operate, however\r\n  slowly, not only will there continually be found new species, new\r\n  genera, and even new orders, but each species will vary in some part\r\n  of its structure and its form.\r\n\r\n  \"I very well know that to our eyes there seems in this respect a\r\n  _stability_ which we believe to be constant, although it is not so\r\n  truly; for a very great number of centuries may form a period\r\n  insufficient for the changes of which I speak to be marked enough\r\n  for us to appreciate them. Thus we say that the flamingo\r\n  (_Phoenicopterus_) has always had as long legs and as long a neck\r\n  as have those with which we are familiar; finally, it is said that\r\n  all animals whose history has been transmitted for 2,000 or 3,000\r\n  years are always the same, and have lost or acquired nothing in the\r\n  process of perfection of their organs and in the form of their\r\n  different parts. We may be assured that this appearance of\r\n  _stability_ of things in nature will always be taken for reality by\r\n  the average of mankind, because in general it judges everything only\r\n  relatively to itself.\r\n\r\n  \"But, I repeat, this consideration which has given rise to the\r\n  admitted error owes its source to the very great slowness of the\r\n  changes which have gone on. A little attention given to the facts\r\n  which I am about to cite will afford the strongest proof of my\r\n  assertion.\r\n\r\n  \"What nature does after a great length of time we do every day by\r\n  suddenly changing, as regards a living being, the circumstances in\r\n  which it and all the individuals of its species are placed.\r\n\r\n  \"All botanists know that the plants which they transplant from their\r\n  natal spot into gardens for cultivation there gradually undergo\r\n  changes which in the end render them unrecognizable. Many plants\r\n  naturally very hairy, there become glabrous or nearly so; a quantity\r\n  of those which were procumbent or trailing there have erect stems;\r\n  others lose their spines or their thorns; finally, the dimensions of\r\n  parts undergo changes which the circumstances of their new situation\r\n  infallibly produce. This is so well known that botanists prefer not\r\n  to describe them, at least unless they are newly cultivated. Is not\r\n  wheat (_Triticum sativum_) a plant brought by man to the state\r\n  wherein we actually see it, which otherwise I could not believe? Who\r\n  can now say in what place its like lives in nature?\r\n\r\n  \"To these known facts I will add others still more remarkable, and\r\n  which confirm the view that change of circumstances operates to\r\n  change the parts of living organisms.\r\n\r\n  \"When _Ranunculus aquatilis_ lives in deep water, all it can do\r\n  while growing is to make the end of its stalks reach the surface of\r\n  the water where they flourish. Then all the leaves of the plant are\r\n  finely cut or pinked.[168] If the same plant grows in shallower\r\n  water the growth of its stalks may give them sufficient extent for\r\n  the upper leaves to develop out of the water; then its lower leaves\r\n  only will be divided into hair-like joints, while the upper ones\r\n  will be simple, rounded, and a little lobed.[169] This is not all:\r\n  when the seeds of the same plant fall into some ditch where there is\r\n  only water or moisture sufficient to make them germinate, the plant\r\n  develops all its leaves in the air, and then none of them is divided\r\n  into capillary points, which gives rise to _Ranunculus hederaceus_,\r\n  which botanists regard as a species.\r\n\r\n  \"Another very striking proof of the effect of a change of\r\n  circumstances on a plant submitted to it is the following:\r\n\r\n  \"It is observed that when a tuft of _Juncus bufonius_ grows very\r\n  near the edge of the water in a ditch or marsh this rush then pushes\r\n  out filiform stems which lie in the water, are there deformed,\r\n  becoming disturbed (_traçantes_), proliferous, and very different\r\n  from that of _Juncus bufonius_ which grows out of water. This plant,\r\n  modified by the circumstances I have just indicated, has been\r\n  regarded as a distinct species; it is the _Juncus supinus_ of\r\n  Rotte.[170]\r\n\r\n  \"I could also give citations to prove that the changes of\r\n  circumstances relative to organisms necessarily change the\r\n  influences which they undergo on the part of all that which environs\r\n  them or which acts on them, and so necessarily bring about changes\r\n  in their size, their shape, their different organs.\r\n\r\n  \"Then among living beings nature seems to me to offer in an absolute\r\n  manner only individuals which succeed one another by generation.\r\n\r\n  \"However, in order to facilitate the study and recognition of these\r\n  organisms, I give the name of _species_ to every collection of\r\n  individuals which during a long period resemble each other so much\r\n  in all their parts that these individuals only present small\r\n  accidental differences which, in plants, reproduction by seeds\r\n  causes to disappear.\r\n\r\n  \"But, besides that at the end of a long period the totality of\r\n  individuals of such a species change as the circumstances which act\r\n  on them, those of these individuals which from special causes are\r\n  transported into very different situations from those where the\r\n  others occur, and then constantly submitted to other influences--the\r\n  former, I say, assume new forms as the result of a long habit of\r\n  this other mode of existence, and then they constitute a new\r\n  _species_, which comprehends all the individuals which occur in the\r\n  same condition of existence. We see, then, the faithful picture of\r\n  that which happened in this respect in nature, and of that which the\r\n  observation of its acts can alone discover to us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Lamarck's Views on Species, as published in 1803._\r\n\r\nIn the opening lecture[171] of his course at the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, delivered in prairial (May 20-June 18), 1803, we have a\r\nfurther statement of the theoretical views of Lamarck on species and\r\ntheir origin. He addresses his audience as \"Citoyens,\" France still\r\nbeing under the _régime_ of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe brochure containing this address is exceedingly rare, the only copy\r\nexisting, as far as we know, being in the library of the Museum of\r\nNatural History in Paris. The author's name is not even given, and there\r\nis no imprint. Lamarck's name, however, is written on the outside of the\r\ncover of the copy we have translated. At the end of the otherwise blank\r\npage succeeding the last page (p. 46) is printed the words: _Esquisse\r\nd'un Philosophie zoologique_, the preliminary sketch, however, never\r\nhaving been added.\r\n\r\nHe begins by telling his hearers that they should not desire to burden\r\ntheir memories with the infinite details and immense nomenclature of\r\nthe prodigious quantity of animals among which we distinguish an\r\nillimitable number of species, \"but what is more worthy of you, and of\r\nmore educational value, you should seek to know the course of nature.\"\r\n\"You may enter upon the study of classes, orders, genera, and even of\r\nthe most interesting species, because this would be useful to you; but\r\nyou should never forget that all these subdivisions, which could not,\r\nhowever, be well spared, are artificial, and that nature does not\r\nrecognize any of them.\"\r\n\r\n  \"In the opening lecture of my last year's course I tried to convince\r\n  you that it is only in the organization of animals that we find the\r\n  foundation of the natural relations between the different groups,\r\n  where they diverge and where they approach each other. Finally, I\r\n  tried to show you that the enormous series of animals which nature\r\n  has produced presents, from that of its extremities where are placed\r\n  the most perfect animals, down to that which comprises the most\r\n  imperfect, or the most simple, an evident modification, though\r\n  irregularly defined (_nuancé_), in the structure of the\r\n  organization.\r\n\r\n  \"To-day, after having recalled some of the essential considerations\r\n  which form the base of this great truth; after having shown you the\r\n  principal means by which nature is enabled to create (_opérer_) her\r\n  innumerable productions and to vary them infinitely; finally, after\r\n  having made you see that in the use she has made of her power of\r\n  generating and multiplying living beings she has necessarily\r\n  proceeded from the more simple to the more complex, gradually\r\n  complicating the organization of these bodies, as also the\r\n  composition of their substance, while also in that which she has\r\n  done on non-living bodies she has occupied herself unremittingly in\r\n  the destruction of all preëxistent combinations, I shall undertake\r\n  to examine under your eyes the great question in natural\r\n  history--What is a _species_ among organized beings?\r\n\r\n  \"When we consider the series of animals, beginning at the end\r\n  comprising the most perfect and complicated, and passing down\r\n  through all the degrees of this series to the other end, we see a\r\n  very evident modification in structure and faculties. On the\r\n  contrary, if we begin with the end which comprises animals the most\r\n  simple in organization, the poorest in faculties and in organs--in a\r\n  word, the most imperfect in all respects--we necessarily remark, as\r\n  we gradually ascend in the series, a truly progressive complication\r\n  in the organization of these different animals, and we see the\r\n  organs and faculties of these beings successively multiplying and\r\n  diversifying in a most remarkable manner.\r\n\r\n  \"These facts once known present truths which are, to some extent,\r\n  eternal; for nothing here is the product of our imagination or of\r\n  our arbitrary principles; that which I have just explained rests\r\n  neither on systems nor on any hypothesis: it is only the very simple\r\n  result of the observation of nature; hence I do not fear to advance\r\n  the view that all that one can imagine, from any motives whatever,\r\n  to contradict these great verities will always be destroyed by the\r\n  evidence of the facts with which it deals.\r\n\r\n  \"To these facts it is necessary to add these very important\r\n  considerations, which observation has led me to perceive, and the\r\n  basis of which will always be recognized by those who pay attention\r\n  to them; they are as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Firstly, the exercise of life, and consequently of organic\r\n  movement, constitutes its activity, tends, without ceasing, not only\r\n  to develop and to extend the organization, but it tends besides to\r\n  multiply the organs and to isolate them in special centres\r\n  (_foyers_). To make sure whether the exercise of life tends to\r\n  extend and develop the organization, it suffices to consider the\r\n  state of the organs of any animal which has just been born, and to\r\n  compare them in this condition with what they are when the animal\r\n  has attained the period when its organs cease to receive any new\r\n  development. Then we will see on what this organic law is based,\r\n  which I have published in my _Recherches sur les Corps vivans_\r\n  (p. 8), _i.e._, that--\r\n\r\n  \"'The special property of movement of fluids in the supple parts of\r\n  the living body which contain them is to open (_frayer_) there\r\n  routes, places of deposit and tissues; to create there canals, and\r\n  consequently different organs; to cause these canals and these\r\n  organs to vary there by reason of the diversity both of the\r\n  movements as well as the nature of the fluids which occur there;\r\n  finally to enlarge, to elongate, to divide and to gradually\r\n  strengthen (_affermir_) these canals and their organs by the matters\r\n  which are formed in the fluids in motion, which incessantly separate\r\n  themselves, and a part of which is assimilated and united with\r\n  organs while the rest is rejected.'\r\n\r\n  \"Secondly, the continual employment of an organ, especially if it is\r\n  strongly exercised, strengthens this organ, develops it, increases\r\n  its dimensions, enlarges and extends its faculties.\r\n\r\n  \"This second law of effects of exercise of life has been understood\r\n  for a long time by those observers who have paid attention to the\r\n  phenomena of organization.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, we know that all the time that an organ, or a system of\r\n  organs, is rigorously exercised throughout a long time, not only its\r\n  power, and the parts which form it, grow and strengthen themselves,\r\n  but there are proofs that this organ, or system of organs, at that\r\n  time attracts to itself the principal active forces of the life of\r\n  the individual, because it becomes the cause which, under these\r\n  conditions, makes the functions of other organs to be diminished in\r\n  power.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus not only every organ or every part of the body, whether of man\r\n  or of animals, being for a long period and more vigorously exercised\r\n  than the others, has acquired a power and facility of action that\r\n  the same organ could not have had before, and that it has never had\r\n  in individuals which have exercised less, but also we consequently\r\n  remark that the excessive employment of this organ diminishes the\r\n  functions of the others and proportionately enfeebles them.\r\n\r\n  \"The man who habitually and vigorously exercises the organ of his\r\n  intelligence develops and acquires a great facility of attention, of\r\n  aptitude for thought, etc., but he has a feeble stomach and strongly\r\n  limited muscular powers. He, on the contrary, who thinks little does\r\n  not easily, and then only momentarily fixes his attention, while\r\n  habitually giving much exercise to his muscular organs, has much\r\n  vigor, possesses an excellent digestion, and is not given to the\r\n  abstemiousness of the savant and man of letters.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, when one exercises long and vigorously an organ or system\r\n  of organs, the active forces of life (in my opinion, the nervous\r\n  fluid) have taken such a habit of acting (_porter_) towards this\r\n  organ that they have formed in the individual an inclination to\r\n  continue to exercise which it is difficult for it to overcome.\r\n\r\n  \"Hence it happens that the more we exercise an organ, the more we\r\n  use it with facility, the more does it result that we perceive the\r\n  need (_besoin_) of continuing to use it at the times when it is\r\n  placed in action. So we remark that the habit of study, of\r\n  application, of work, or of any other exercise of our organs or of\r\n  any one of our organs, becomes with time an indispensable need to\r\n  the individual, and often a passion which it does not know how to\r\n  overcome.\r\n\r\n  \"Thirdly, finally, the effort made by necessity to obtain new\r\n  faculties is aided by the concurrence of favorable circumstances;\r\n  they create (_créent_) with time the new organs which are adapted\r\n  (_propres_) to their faculties, and which as the result develop\r\n  after long use (_qu'en suite un long emploi développe_).\r\n\r\n  \"How important is this consideration, and what light it spreads on\r\n  the state of organization of the different animals now living!\r\n\r\n  \"Assuredly it will not be those who have long been in the habit of\r\n  observing nature, and who have followed attentively that which\r\n  happens to living individuals (to animals and to plants), who will\r\n  deny that a great change in the circumstances of their situation and\r\n  of their means of existence forces them and their race to adopt new\r\n  habits; it will not be those, I say, who attempt to contest the\r\n  foundation of the consideration which I have just exposed.\r\n\r\n  \"They can readily convince themselves of the solidity of that which\r\n  I have already published in this respect.[172]\r\n\r\n  \"I have felt obliged to recall to you these great considerations, a\r\n  sketch of which I traced for you last year, and which I have stated\r\n  for the most part in my different works, because they serve, as you\r\n  have seen, as a solution of the problem which interests so many\r\n  naturalists, and which concerns the determination of _species_ among\r\n  living bodies.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, if in ascending in the series of animals from the most\r\n  simply organized animalcule, as from the monad, which seems to be\r\n  only an animated point, up to the animals the most perfect, or whose\r\n  structure is the most complicated--in a word, up to animals with\r\n  mammæ--you observe in the different orders which comprise this great\r\n  series a gradation, shaded (_nuancé_), although irregular, in the\r\n  composition of the organization and in the increasing number of\r\n  faculties, is it not evident that in the case where nature would\r\n  exert some active power on the existence of these organized bodies\r\n  she has been able to make them exist only by beginning with the most\r\n  simple, and that she has been able to form directly among the\r\n  animals only that which I call the rough sketches or germs\r\n  (_ébauches_) of animality--that is to say, only these animalcules,\r\n  almost invisible and to some extent without consistence, that we see\r\n  develop spontaneously and in an astonishing abundance in certain\r\n  places and under certain circumstances, while only in contrary\r\n  circumstances are they totally destroyed?\r\n\r\n  \"Do we not therefore perceive that by the action of the laws of\r\n  organization, which I have just now indicated, and by that of\r\n  different means of multiplication which are due to them (_qui en\r\n  dérivent_), nature has in favorable times, places, and climates\r\n  multiplied her first germs (_ébauches_) of animality, given place to\r\n  developments of their organizations, rendered gradually greater the\r\n  duration of those which have originally descended from them, and\r\n  increased and diversified their organs? Then always preserving the\r\n  progress acquired by the reproductions of individuals and the\r\n  succession of generations, and aided by much time and by a slow but\r\n  constant diversity of circumstances, she has gradually brought about\r\n  in this respect the state of things which we now observe.\r\n\r\n  \"How grand is this consideration, and especially how remote is it\r\n  from all that is generally thought on this subject! Moreover, the\r\n  astonishment which its novelty and its singularity may excite in you\r\n  requires that at first you should suspend your judgment in regard to\r\n  it. But the observation which establishes it is now on record\r\n  (_consignée_), and the facts which support it exist and are\r\n  incessantly renewed; however, as they open a vast field to your\r\n  studies and to your own researches, it is to you yourselves that I\r\n  appeal to pronounce on this great subject when you have sufficiently\r\n  examined and followed all the facts which relate to it.\r\n\r\n  \"If among living bodies there are any the consideration of whose\r\n  organization and of the phenomena which they produce can enlighten\r\n  us as to the power of nature and its course relatively to the\r\n  existence of these bodies, also as to the variations which they\r\n  undergo, we certainly have to seek for them in the lowest classes of\r\n  the two organic kingdoms (the animals and the plants). It is in the\r\n  classes which comprise the living bodies whose organization is the\r\n  least complex that we can observe and bring together facts the most\r\n  luminous, observations the most decisive on the origin of these\r\n  bodies, on their reproduction and their admirable diversification,\r\n  finally on the formation and the development of their different\r\n  organs, the whole process being aided by the concurrence of\r\n  generations, of time, and of circumstances.\r\n\r\n  \"It is, indeed, among living bodies the most multiplied, the most\r\n  numerous in nature, the most prompt and easy to regenerate\r\n  themselves, that we should seek the most instructive facts bearing\r\n  on the course of nature and on the means she has employed to create\r\n  her innumerable productions. In this case we perceive that,\r\n  relatively to the animal kingdom, we should chiefly give our\r\n  attention to the invertebrate animals, because their enormous\r\n  multiplicity in nature, the singular diversity of their systems of\r\n  organization and of their means of multiplication, their increasing\r\n  simplification, and the extreme fugacity of those which compose the\r\n  lowest orders of these animals, show us much better than the others\r\n  the true course of nature, and the means which she has used and\r\n  which she is still incessantly employing to give existence to all\r\n  the living bodies of which we have knowledge.\r\n\r\n  \"Her course and her means are without doubt the same for the\r\n  production of the different plants which exist. And, indeed, though\r\n  it is not believed, as some naturalists have wrongly held, but\r\n  without proof, that plants are bodies more simple in organization\r\n  than the most simple animals, it is a veritable error which\r\n  observation plainly denies.\r\n\r\n  \"Truly, vegetable substance is less surcharged with constituent\r\n  principles than any animal substance whatever, or at least most of\r\n  them, but the substance of a living body and the organization of\r\n  these bodies are two very different things. But there is in plants,\r\n  as in animals, a true gradation in organization from the plant\r\n  simplest in organization and parts up to plants the most complex in\r\n  structure and with the most diversified organs.\r\n\r\n  \"If there is some approach, or at least some comparison to make\r\n  between vegetables and animals, this can only be by opposing plants\r\n  the most simply organized, like fungi and algæ, to the most\r\n  imperfect animals like the polyps, and especially the amorphous\r\n  polyps, which occur in the lowest order.\r\n\r\n  \"At present we clearly see that in order to bring about the\r\n  existence of animals of all the classes, of all the orders, and of\r\n  all the genera, nature has had to begin by giving existence to those\r\n  which are the most simple in organization and lacking most in organs\r\n  and faculties, the frailest in constituency, the most ephemeral, the\r\n  quickest and easiest to multiply; and we shall find in the\r\n  _amorphous_ or _microscopic polyps_ the most striking examples of\r\n  this simplification of organization, and the indication that it is\r\n  solely among them that occur the astonishing germs of animality.\r\n\r\n  \"At present we only know the principal law of the organization, the\r\n  power of the exercise of the functions of life, the influence of the\r\n  movement of fluids in the supple parts of organic bodies, and the\r\n  power which the regenerations have of conserving the progress\r\n  acquired in the composition of organs.\r\n\r\n  \"At present, finally, relying on numerous observations, seeing that\r\n  with the aid of much time, of changes in local circumstances, in\r\n  climates, and consequently in the habits of animals, the progression\r\n  in the complication of their organization and in the diversity of\r\n  their parts has gradually operated (_a dû s'opérer_) in a way that\r\n  all the animals now known have been successively formed such as we\r\n  now see them, it becomes possible to find the solution of the\r\n  following question:\r\n\r\n  \"What is a _species_ among living beings?\r\n\r\n  \"All those who have much to do with the study of natural history\r\n  know that naturalists at the present day are extremely embarrassed\r\n  in defining what they mean by the word species.\r\n\r\n  \"In truth, observation for a long time has shown us, and shows us\r\n  still in a great number of cases, collections of individuals which\r\n  resemble each other so much in their organization and by the\r\n  _ensemble_ of their parts that we do not hesitate to regard these\r\n  collections of similar individuals as constituting so many species.\r\n\r\n  \"From this consideration we call _species_ every collection of\r\n  individuals which are alike or almost so, and we remark that the\r\n  regeneration of these individuals conserves the species and\r\n  propagates it in continuing successively to reproduce similar\r\n  individuals.\r\n\r\n  \"Formerly it was supposed that each species was immutable, as old as\r\n  nature, and that she had caused its special creation by the Supreme\r\n  Author of all which exists.\r\n\r\n  \"But we can impose on him laws in the execution of his will, and\r\n  determine the mode which he has been pleased to follow in this\r\n  respect, so it is only in this way that he permits us to recognize\r\n  it by the aid of observation. Has not his infinite power created an\r\n  order of things which successively gives existence to all that we\r\n  see as well as to all that which exists and which we do not know?\r\n\r\n  \"Assuredly, whatever has been his will, the omnipotence of his power\r\n  is always the same; and in whatever way this supreme will has been\r\n  manifested, nothing can diminish its greatness. As regards, then,\r\n  the decrees of this infinite wisdom, I confine myself to the limits\r\n  of a simple observer of nature. Then, if I discover anything in the\r\n  course that nature follows in her creations, I shall say, without\r\n  fear of deceiving myself, that it has pleased its author that she\r\n  possesses this power.\r\n\r\n  \"The idea that was held as to species among living bodies was quite\r\n  simple, easy to grasp, and seemed confirmed by the constancy in the\r\n  similar form of the individuals which reproduction or generation\r\n  perpetuated. There still occur among us a very great number of these\r\n  pretended species which we see every day.\r\n\r\n  \"However, the farther we advance in the knowledge of the different\r\n  organized bodies with which almost every part of the surface of the\r\n  globe is covered, the more does our embarrassment increase in\r\n  determining what should be regarded as species, and the greater is\r\n  the reason for limiting and distinguishing the genera.\r\n\r\n  \"As we gradually gather the productions of nature, as our\r\n  collections gradually grow richer, we see almost all the gaps filled\r\n  up, and our lines of demarcation effaced. We find ourselves\r\n  compelled to make an arbitrary determination, which sometimes leads\r\n  us to seize upon the slightest differences between varieties to form\r\n  of them the character of that which we call species, and sometimes\r\n  one person designates as a variety of such a species individuals a\r\n  little different, which others regard as constituting a particular\r\n  species.\r\n\r\n  \"I repeat, the richer our collections become, the more numerous are\r\n  the proofs that all is more or less shaded (_nuancé_), that the\r\n  remarkable differences become obliterated, and that the more often\r\n  nature leaves it at our disposal to establish distinctions only\r\n  minute, and in some degree trivial peculiarities.\r\n\r\n  \"But some genera among animals and plants are of such an extent,\r\n  from the number of species they contain, that the study and the\r\n  determination of these species are now almost impossible. The\r\n  species of these genera, arranged in series and placed together\r\n  according to their natural relations, present, with those allied to\r\n  them, differences so slight that they shade into each other; and\r\n  because these species are in some degree confounded with one another\r\n  they leave almost no means of determining, by expression in words,\r\n  the small differences which distinguish them.\r\n\r\n  \"There are also those who have been for a long time, and strongly,\r\n  occupied with the determination of the species, and who have\r\n  consulted rich collections, who can understand up to what point\r\n  species, among living bodies, merge one into another (_fondent les\r\n  unes dans les autres_), and who have been able to convince\r\n  themselves, in the regions (_parties_) where we see isolated\r\n  species, that this is only because there are wanting other species\r\n  which are more nearly related, and which we have not yet collected.\r\n\r\n  \"I do not mean to say by this that the existing animals form a very\r\n  simple series, one everywhere equally graduated; but I say that they\r\n  form a branching series, irregularly graduated, and which has no\r\n  discontinuity in its parts, or which at best has not always had, if\r\n  it is true that it is to be found anywhere (_s'il est vrai qu'il\r\n  s'en trouve quelque part_). It results from this that the species\r\n  which terminates each branch of the general series holds a place at\r\n  least on one side apart from the other allied species which\r\n  intergrade with them. Behold this state of things, so well known,\r\n  which I am now compelled to demonstrate.\r\n\r\n  \"I have no need (_besoin_) of any hypothesis or any supposition for\r\n  this: I call to witness all observing naturalists.\r\n\r\n  \"Not only many genera, but entire orders, and some classes even,\r\n  already present us with portions almost complete of the state of\r\n  things which I have just indicated.\r\n\r\n  \"However, when in this case we have arranged the species in series,\r\n  and they are all well placed according to their natural relations,\r\n  if you select one of them, and it results in making a leap (_saut\r\n  pardessus_) over to several others, you take another one of them a\r\n  little less remote; these two species, placed in comparison, will\r\n  then present the greatest differences from each other. It is thus\r\n  that we had begun to regard most of the productions of nature which\r\n  occur at our door. Then the generic and specific distinctions were\r\n  very easy to establish. But now that our collections are very much\r\n  richer, if you follow the series that I have cited above, from the\r\n  species that you first chose up to that which you took in the second\r\n  place, and which is very different from the first, you have passed\r\n  from shade to shade without having remarked any differences worth\r\n  noticing.\r\n\r\n  \"I ask what experienced zoölogist or botanist is there who has not\r\n  thoroughly realized that which I have just explained to you?\r\n\r\n  \"Or how can one study, or how can one be able to determine in a\r\n  thorough way the species, among the multitude of known polyps of all\r\n  orders of radiates, worms, and especially of insects, where the\r\n  simple genera of Papilio, Phalæna, Noctua, Tinea, Musca, Ichneumon,\r\n  Curculio, Capricorn, Scarabæus, Cetonia, etc., etc., already contain\r\n  so many closely allied species which shade into each other, are\r\n  almost confounded one with another? What a host of molluscan shells\r\n  exist in every country and in all seas which elude our means of\r\n  distinction, and exhaust our resources in this respect! Ascend to\r\n  the fishes, to the reptiles, to the birds, even to the mammals, and\r\n  you will see, except the lacunæ which are still to be filled,\r\n  everywhere shadings which take place between allied species, even\r\n  the genera, and where after the most industrious study we fail to\r\n  establish good distinctions. Does not botany, which considers the\r\n  other series, comprising the plants, offer us, in its different\r\n  parts, a state of things perfectly similar? In short, what\r\n  difficulties do not arise in the study and in the determination of\r\n  species in the genera Lichena, Fucus, Carex, Poa, Piper, Euphorbia,\r\n  Erica, Hieracium, Solanum, Geranium, Mimosa, etc., etc.?\r\n\r\n  \"When these genera were established but a small number of species\r\n  were known, and then it was easy to distinguish them; but at present\r\n  almost all the gaps between them are filled, and our specific\r\n  differences are necessarily minute and very often insufficient.\r\n\r\n  \"From this state of things well established we see what are the\r\n  causes which have given rise to them; we see whether nature\r\n  possesses the means for this, and if observation has been able to\r\n  give us our explanation of it.\r\n\r\n  \"A great many facts teach us that gradually as the individuals of\r\n  one of our species change their situation, climate, mode of life, or\r\n  habits, they thus receive influences which gradually change the\r\n  consistence and the proportions of their parts, their form, their\r\n  faculties, even their organization; so that all of them participate\r\n  eventually in the changes which they have undergone.\r\n\r\n  \"In the same climate, very different situations and exposures at\r\n  first cause simple variations in the individuals which are found\r\n  exposed there; but, as time goes on, the continual differences of\r\n  situation of individuals of which I have spoken, which live and\r\n  successively reproduce in the same circumstances, give rise among\r\n  them to differences which are, in some degree, essential to their\r\n  being, in such a way that at the end of many successive generations\r\n  these individuals, which originally belonged to another species, are\r\n  at the end transformed into a new species, distinct from the other.\r\n\r\n  \"For example, if the seeds of a grass, or of every other plant\r\n  natural to a humid field, should be transplanted, by an accident, at\r\n  first to the slope of a neighboring hill, where the soil, although\r\n  more elevated, would yet be quite cool (_frais_) so as to allow the\r\n  plant to live, and then after having lived there, and passed through\r\n  many generations there, it should gradually reach the poor and\r\n  almost arid soil of a mountain side--if the plant should thrive and\r\n  live there and perpetuate itself during a series of generations, it\r\n  would then be so changed that the botanists who should find it there\r\n  would describe it as a separate species.\r\n\r\n  \"The same thing happens to animals which circumstances have forced\r\n  to change their climate, manner of living, and habits; but for these\r\n  the influences of the causes which I have just cited need still more\r\n  time than in the case of plants to produce the notable changes in\r\n  the individuals, though in the long run, however, they always\r\n  succeed in bringing them about.\r\n\r\n  \"The idea of defining under the word _species_ a collection of\r\n  similar individuals which perpetuate the same by generation, and\r\n  which have existed thus as anciently as nature, implies the\r\n  necessity that the individuals of one and the same species cannot\r\n  mix, in their acts of generation, with the individuals of a\r\n  different species. Unfortunately observation has proved, and still\r\n  proves every day, that this consideration has no basis; for the\r\n  hybrids, very common among plants, and the unions which are often\r\n  observed between the individuals of very different species among\r\n  animals, have made us perceive that the limits between these\r\n  species, supposed to be constant, are not so rigid as is supposed.\r\n\r\n  \"In truth, nothing often results from these singular unions,\r\n  especially when they are very incongruous, as the individuals which\r\n  result from them are usually sterile; but also, when the disparities\r\n  are less great, it is known that the drawbacks (_défauts_) with\r\n  which it has to do no longer exist. However, this means alone\r\n  suffices to gradually create the varieties which have afterwards\r\n  arisen from races, and which, with time, constitute that which we\r\n  call _species_.\r\n\r\n  \"To judge whether the idea which is formed of species has any real\r\n  foundation, let us return to the considerations which I have already\r\n  stated; they are, namely--\r\n\r\n  \"1. That all the organic bodies of our globe are veritable\r\n  productions of nature, which she has created in succession at the\r\n  end of much time.\r\n\r\n  \"2. That in her course nature has begun, and begins anew every day,\r\n  by forming the simplest organic bodies, and that she directly forms\r\n  only these--that is to say, only these first primitive germs\r\n  (_ébauches_) of organization, which have been badly characterized by\r\n  the expression of \"spontaneous generations\" (_qu'on a désignées\r\n  mal-à-propos par l'expression de Générations spontanées_).\r\n\r\n  \"3. That the first germs (_ébauches_) of the animals and plants were\r\n  formed in favorable places and circumstances. The functions of life\r\n  beginning and an organic movement established, these have\r\n  necessarily gradually developed the organs, so that after a time and\r\n  under suitable circumstances they have been differentiated, as also\r\n  the different parts (_elles les ont diversifiés ainsi qui les\r\n  parties_).\r\n\r\n  \"4. That the power of increase in each portion of organic bodies\r\n  being inherited at the first production (_effets_) of life, it has\r\n  given rise to different modes of multiplication and of regeneration\r\n  of individuals; and in that way the progress acquired in the\r\n  composition of the organization and in the forms and the diversity\r\n  of the parts has been preserved.\r\n\r\n  \"5. That with the aid of sufficient time, of circumstances which\r\n  have been necessarily favorable, of changes that all parts of the\r\n  surface of the globe have successively undergone in their\r\n  condition--in a word, with the power that new situations and new\r\n  habits have in modifying the organs of bodies endowed with life--all\r\n  those which now exist have been imperceptibly formed such as we see\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  \"6. Finally, that according to a similar order of things, living\r\n  beings, having undergone each of the more or less great changes in\r\n  the condition of their organization and of their parts, that which\r\n  is designated as a species among them has been insensibly and\r\n  successively so formed, can have only a relative constancy in its\r\n  condition, and cannot be as ancient as nature.\r\n\r\n  \"But, it will be said, when it is necessary to suppose that, with\r\n  the aid of much time and of an infinite variation in circumstances,\r\n  nature has gradually formed the different animals that we know,\r\n  would we not be stopped in this supposition by the sole\r\n  consideration of the admirable diversity which we observe in the\r\n  instinct of different animals, and by that of the marvels of all\r\n  sorts which their different kinds of industry present?\r\n\r\n  \"Will one dare to carry the spirit of system (_porter l'esprit de\r\n  système_) to the point of saying that it is nature, and she alone,\r\n  which creates this astonishing diversity of means, of ruses, of\r\n  skill, of precautions, of patience, of which the industry of animals\r\n  offers us so many examples! What we observe in this respect in the\r\n  class of insects alone, is it not a thousand times more than is\r\n  necessary to compel us to perceive that the limits of the power of\r\n  nature by no means permit her herself to produce so many marvels,\r\n  and to force the most obstinate philosophy to recognize that here\r\n  the will of the supreme author of all things has been necessary, and\r\n  has alone sufficed to cause the existence of so many admirable\r\n  things?\r\n\r\n  \"Without doubt one would be rash, or rather wholly unreasonable, to\r\n  pretend to assign limits to the power of the first author of all\r\n  things; and by that alone no one can dare to say that this infinite\r\n  power has not been able to will that which nature herself shows us\r\n  she has willed.\r\n\r\n  \"This being so, if I discover that nature herself brings about or\r\n  causes all the wonders just cited; that she creates the\r\n  organization, the life, even feeling; that she multiplies and\r\n  diversifies, within limits which are not known to us, the organs and\r\n  faculties of organic bodies the existence of which she sustains or\r\n  propagates; that she has created in animals by the single way of\r\n  _need_, which establishes and directs the habits, the source of all\r\n  actions, from the most simple up to those which constitute\r\n  _instinct_, industry, finally reason, should I not recognize in this\r\n  power of nature--that is to say, of existing things--the execution\r\n  of the will of its sublime author, who has been able to will that it\r\n  should have this power? Shall I any the less wonder at the\r\n  omnipotence of the power of the first cause of all things, if it has\r\n  pleased itself that things should be thus, than if by so many\r\n  (separate) acts of his omnipotent will he should be occupied and\r\n  occupy himself still continually with details of all the special\r\n  creations, all the variations, and all the developments and\r\n  perfections, all the destructions and all the renewals--in a word,\r\n  with all the changes which are in general produced in things which\r\n  exist?\r\n\r\n  \"But I intend to prove in my 'Biologie' that nature possesses in her\r\n  _faculties_ all that is necessary to have to be able herself to\r\n  produce that which we admire in her works; and regarding this\r\n  subject I shall then enter into sufficient details which I am here\r\n  obliged to omit.[173]\r\n\r\n  \"However, it is still objected that all we see stated regarding the\r\n  state of living bodies are unalterable conditions in the\r\n  preservation of their form, and it is thought that all the animals\r\n  whom history has transmitted to us for two or three thousand years\r\n  have always remained the same, and have lost nothing nor acquired\r\n  anything in the perfecting of their organs and in the form of their\r\n  parts.\r\n\r\n  \"While this apparent stability has for a long time been accepted as\r\n  true, it has just been attempted to establish special proofs in a\r\n  report on the collections of natural history brought from Egypt by\r\n  the citizen Geoffroy.\"\r\n\r\nQuotes three paragraphs in which the reporters (Cuvier and Geoffroy\r\nSt. Hilaire) say that the mummied animals of Thebes and Memphis are\r\nperfectly similar to those of to-day. Then he goes on to say:\r\n\r\n  \"I have seen them, these animals, and I believe in the conformity of\r\n  their resemblance with the individuals of the same species which\r\n  live to-day. Thus the animals which the Egyptians worshipped and\r\n  embalmed two or three thousand years ago are still in every respect\r\n  similar to those which actually live in that country.\r\n\r\n  \"But it would be assuredly very singular that this should be\r\n  otherwise; for the position of Egypt and its climate are still or\r\n  very nearly the same as at former times. Therefore the animals which\r\n  live there have not been compelled to change their habits.\r\n\r\n  \"There is, then, nothing in the observation which has just been\r\n  reported which should be contrary to the considerations which I\r\n  have expressed on this subject; and which especially proves that the\r\n  animals of which it treats have existed during the whole period of\r\n  nature. It only proves that they have existed for two or three\r\n  thousand years; and every one who is accustomed to reflect, and at\r\n  the same time to observe that which nature shows us of the monuments\r\n  of its antiquity, readily appreciates the value of a duration of two\r\n  or three thousand years in comparison with it.\r\n\r\n  \"Hence, as I have elsewhere said, it is sure that this appearance of\r\n  the stability of things in nature will always be mistaken by the\r\n  average of mankind for the reality; because in general people only\r\n  judge of everything relatively to themselves.\r\n\r\n  \"For the man who observes, and who in this respect only judges from\r\n  the changes which he himself perceives, the intervals of these\r\n  changes are _stationary conditions_ (_états_) which should appear to\r\n  be limitless, because of the brevity of life of the individuals of\r\n  his species. Thus, as the records of his observations and the notes\r\n  of facts which he has consigned to his registers only extend and\r\n  mount up to several thousands of years (three to five thousand\r\n  years), which is an infinitely small period of time relatively to\r\n  those which have sufficed to bring about the great changes which the\r\n  surface of the globe has undergone, everything seems _stable_ to him\r\n  in the planet which he inhabits, and he is inclined to reject the\r\n  monuments heaped up around him or buried in the earth which he\r\n  treads under his feet, and which surrounds him on all sides.[174]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"It seems to me [as mistaken as] to expect some small creatures\r\n  which only live a year, which inhabit some corner of a building,\r\n  and which we may suppose are occupied with consulting among\r\n  themselves as to the tradition, to pronounce on the duration of the\r\n  edifice where they occur: and that going back in their paltry\r\n  history to the twenty-fifth generation, they should unanimously\r\n  decide that the building which serves to shelter them is eternal, or\r\n  at least that it has always existed; because it has always appeared\r\n  the same to them; and since they have never heard it said that it\r\n  had a beginning. Great things (_grandeurs_) in extent and in\r\n  duration are relative.[175]\r\n\r\n  \"When man wishes to clearly represent this truth he will be reserved\r\n  in his decisions in regard to stability, which he attributes in\r\n  nature to the state of things which he observes there.[176]\r\n\r\n  \"To admit the insensible change of species, and the modifications\r\n  which individuals undergo as they are gradually forced to vary their\r\n  habits or to contract new ones, we are not reduced to the unique\r\n  consideration of too small spaces of time which our observations can\r\n  embrace to permit us to perceive these changes; for, besides this\r\n  induction, a quantity of facts collected for many years throws\r\n  sufficient light on the question that I examine, so that does not\r\n  remain undecided; and I can say now that our sciences of observation\r\n  are too advanced not to have the solution sought for made evident.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, besides what we know of the influences and the results of\r\n  heteroclite fecundations, we know positively to-day that a forced\r\n  and long-sustained change, both in the habits and mode of life of\r\n  animals, and in the situation, soil, and climate of plants, brings\r\n  about, after a sufficient time has elapsed, a very remarkable change\r\n  in the individuals which are exposed to them.\r\n\r\n  \"The animal which lives a free, wandering life on plains, where it\r\n  habitually exercises itself in running swiftly; the birds whose\r\n  needs (_besoins_) require them unceasingly to traverse great spaces\r\n  in the air, finding themselves enclosed, some in the compartments of\r\n  our menageries or in our stables, and others in our cages or in our\r\n  poultry yards, are submitted there in time to striking influences,\r\n  especially after a series of regenerations under the conditions\r\n  which have made them contract new habits. The first loses in large\r\n  part its nimbleness, its agility; its body becomes stouter, its\r\n  limbs diminish in power and suppleness, and its faculties are no\r\n  longer the same. The second become clumsy; they are unable to fly,\r\n  and grow more fleshy in all parts of their bodies.\r\n\r\n  \"Behold in our stout and clumsy horses, habituated to draw heavy\r\n  loads, and which constitute a special race by always being kept\r\n  together--behold, I say, the difference in their form compared with\r\n  those of English horses, which are all slender, with long necks,\r\n  because for a long period they have been trained to run swiftly:\r\n  behold in them the influence of a difference of habit, and judge for\r\n  yourselves. You find them, then, such as they are in some degree in\r\n  nature. You find there our cock and our hen in the condition we have\r\n  [made] them, as also the mixed races that we have formed by mixed\r\n  breeding between the varieties produced in different countries, or\r\n  where they were so in the state of domesticity. You find there\r\n  likewise our different races of domestic pigeons, our different\r\n  dogs, etc. What are our cultivated fruits, our wheat, our cabbage,\r\n  our lettuce, etc., etc., if they are not the result of changes which\r\n  we ourselves have effected in these plants, in changing by our\r\n  culture the conditions of their situation? Are they now found in\r\n  this condition in nature? To these incontestable facts add the\r\n  considerations which I have discussed in my _Recherches sur les\r\n  Corps vivans_ (p. 56 _et suiv._), and decide for yourselves.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus, among living bodies, nature, as I have already said, offers\r\n  only in an absolute way individuals which succeed each other\r\n  genetically, and which descend one from the other. So the _species_\r\n  among them are only relative, and only temporary.\r\n\r\n  \"Nevertheless, to facilitate the study and the knowledge of so many\r\n  different bodies it is useful to give the name of _species_ to the\r\n  entire collection of individuals which are alike, which reproduction\r\n  perpetuates in the same condition as long as the conditions of their\r\n  situation do not change enough to make their habits, their\r\n  character, and their form vary.\r\n\r\n  \"Such is, citizens, the exact sketch of that which goes on in nature\r\n  since she has existed, and of that which the observation of her acts\r\n  has alone enabled us to discover.

These verities are firmly grounded,\r\n  and can only be misunderstood by those who have never observed and\r\n  followed nature in her operations.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus we are assured that that which is taken for _species_ among\r\n  living bodies, and that all the specific differences which\r\n  distinguish these natural productions, have no absolute _stability_,\r\n  but that they enjoy only a relative _stability_; which it is very\r\n  important to consider in order to fix the limits which we must\r\n  establish in the determination of that which we must call _species_.\r\n\r\n  \"It is known that different places change in nature and character by\r\n  reason of their position, their 'composition' [we should say\r\n  geological structure or features], and their climate; that which is\r\n  easily perceived in passing over different places distinguished by\r\n  special characteristics; behold already a cause of variation for the\r\n  natural productions which inhabit these different places. But that\r\n  which is not sufficiently known, and even that which people refuse to\r\n  believe, is that each place itself changes after a time, in exposure,\r\n  in climate, in nature, and in character, although with a slowness so\r\n  great in relation to our period of time that we attribute to it a\r\n  perfect _stability_.\r\n\r\n  \"Now, in either case, these changed places proportionately change\r\n  the circumstances relative to the living bodies which inhabit them,\r\n  and these produce again other influences on those same bodies.\r\n\r\n  \"We see from this that if there are extremes in these changes there\r\n  are also gradations (_nuances_), that is to say, steps which are\r\n  intermediate, and which fill up the interval; consequently there are\r\n  also gradations in the differences which distinguish that which we\r\n  call _species_.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, as we constantly meet with such shades (or intermediate\r\n  steps) between these so-called _species_, we find ourselves forced\r\n  to descend to the minutest details to find any distinctions; the\r\n  slightest peculiarities of form, of color, of size, and often even\r\n  of differences only perceived in the aspect of the individual\r\n  compared with other individuals which are related to it the more by\r\n  their relations, are seized upon by naturalists to establish\r\n  specific differences; so that, the slightest varieties being\r\n  reckoned as species, our catalogues of species grow infinitely\r\n  great, and the name of the productions of nature of the most\r\n  interest to us are, so to speak, buried in these enormous lists,\r\n  become very difficult to find, because now the objects are mostly\r\n  only determined by characters which our senses can scarcely enable\r\n  us to perceive.\r\n\r\n  \"Meanwhile we should remember that nothing of all this exists in\r\n  nature; that she knows neither classes, orders, genera, nor species,\r\n  in spite of all the foundation which the portion of the natural\r\n  series which our collection contains has seemed to afford them; and\r\n  that of organic or living bodies there are, in reality, only\r\n  individuals, and among different races which gradually pass\r\n  (_nuancent_) into all degrees of organization\" (p. 14).\r\n\r\nOn p. 70 he speaks of the animal chain from monad to man, ascending from\r\nthe most simple to the most complex. The monad is the most simple, the\r\nmost like a germ of living bodies, and from its nature passes to the\r\nvolvoces, proteus, vibrios; from them nature arrives at the production\r\nof \"polypes rotifères\"--and then at \"Radiaires,\" worms, Arachnida,\r\nCrustacea, and Cirrhipedes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[162] _Discours d'ouverture du Cours de Zoologie donné dans le Muséum\r\nnational d'Histoire naturelle, le 21 floréal, an 8 de la République_\r\n(1800).

But there is a common\r\nerror in this connection, since it is thought that the forms of organs\r\nhave caused their functions (_en ont amené l'emploi_), whereas it is\r\neasy to demonstrate by observation that it is the uses (_usages_) which\r\nhave given origin to the forms of organs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE \"PHILOSOPHIE ZOOLOGIQUE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLamarck's mature views on the theory of descent comprise a portion of\r\nhis celebrated _Philosophie zoologique_. We will let him tell the story\r\nof creation by natural causes so far as possible in his own words.\r\n\r\nIn the _avertissement_, or preface, he says that his experience has led\r\nhim to realize that a body of precepts and of principles relating to the\r\nstudy of animals and even applicable to other parts of the natural\r\nsciences would now be useful, our knowledge of zoölogical facts having,\r\nfor about thirty years, made considerable progress.\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the differences in structure and faculties\r\ncharacterizing animals of different groups, he proceeds to outline his\r\ntheory, and begins by asking:\r\n\r\n  \"How, indeed, can I consider the singular modification in the\r\n  structure of animals, as we glance over the series from the most\r\n  perfect to the least perfect, without asking how we can account for\r\n  a fact so positive and so remarkable--a fact attested to me by so\r\n  many proofs? Should I not think that nature has successively\r\n  produced the different living beings by proceeding from the most\r\n  simple to the most compound; because in ascending the animal scale\r\n  from the most imperfect up to the most perfect, the organization\r\n  perfects itself and becomes gradually complicated in a most\r\n  remarkable way?\"\r\n\r\nThis leads him to consider what is life, and he remarks (p. xv.) that it\r\ndoes not exist without external stimuli. The conditions necessary for\r\nthe existence of life are found completely developed in the simplest\r\norganization. We are then led to inquire how this organization, by\r\nreason of certain changes, can give rise to other organisms less simple,\r\nand finally originate creatures becoming gradually more complicated, as\r\nwe see in ascending the animal scale. Then employing the two following\r\nconsiderations, he believes he perceives the solution of the problem\r\nwhich has occupied his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe then cites as factors (1) use and disuse; (2) the movement of\r\ninternal fluids by which passages are opened through the cellular tissue\r\nin which they move, and finally create different organs. Hence the\r\n_movement of fluids in the interior of animals_, and the _influence of\r\nnew circumstances_ as animals gradually expose themselves to them in\r\nspreading into every inhabitable place, are the two general causes which\r\nhave produced the different animals in the condition we now see them.\r\nMeanwhile he perceived the importance of the preservation by heredity,\r\nthough he nowhere uses that word, in the new individuals reproduced of\r\neverything which the results of the life and influencing circumstances\r\nhad caused to be acquired in the organization of those which have\r\ntransmitted existence to them.\r\n\r\nIn the _Discours préliminaire_, referring to the _progression_ in\r\norganization of animals from the simplest to man, as also to the\r\nsuccessive acquisition of different special organs, and consequently of\r\nas many faculties as new organs obtained, he remarks:\r\n\r\n  \"Then we can perceive how needs (_besoins_), at the outset reduced\r\n  to nullity, and of which the number gradually increases, have\r\n  produced the inclination (_penchant_) to actions fitted to satisfy\r\n  it; how the actions, becoming habitual and energetic, have caused\r\n  the development of the organs which execute them; how the force\r\n  which excites the organic movements may, in the simplest animals, be\r\n  outside of them and yet animate them; how, then, this force has been\r\n  transported and fixed in the animal itself; finally, how it then has\r\n  become the source of sensibility, and in the end that of acts of\r\n  intelligence.\r\n\r\n  \"I shall add that if this method had been followed, then _sensation_\r\n  would not have been regarded as the general and immediate cause of\r\n  organic movements, and it would not have been said that life is a\r\n  series of movements which are executed in virtue of sensations\r\n  received by different organs; or, in other words, that all the vital\r\n  movements are the product of impressions received by the sensitive\r\n  parts.[179]\r\n\r\n  \"This cause seems, up to a certain point, established as regards the\r\n  most perfect animals; but had it been so relatively to all living\r\n  beings, they should all be endowed with the power of sensation. But\r\n  it cannot be proved that this is the case with plants, and it cannot\r\n  likewise be proved that it is so with all the animals known.\r\n\r\n  \"But nature in creating her organisms has not begun by suddenly\r\n  establishing a faculty so eminent as that of sensation: she has had\r\n  the means of producing this faculty in the imperfect animals of the\r\n  first classes of the animal kingdom,\" referring to the Protozoa. But\r\n  she has accomplished this gradually and successively. \"Nature has\r\n  progressively created the different special organs, also the\r\n  faculties which animals enjoy.\"\r\n\r\nHe remarks that though it is indispensable to classify living forms, yet\r\nthat our classifications are all artificial; that species, genera,\r\nfamilies, orders, and classes do not exist in nature--only the\r\nindividuals really exist. In the third chapter he gives the old\r\ndefinition of species, that they are fixed and immutable, and then\r\nspeaks of the animal series, saying:\r\n\r\n  \"I do not mean by this to say that the existing animals form a very\r\n  simple series, and especially evenly graduated; but I claim that\r\n  they form a branched series,[180] irregularly graduated, and which\r\n  has no discontinuity in its parts, or which, at least, has not\r\n  always had, if it is true that, owing to the extinction of some\r\n  species, there are some breaks. It follows that the _species_ which\r\n  terminates each branch of the general series is connected at least\r\n  on one side with other _species_ which intergrade with it\" (p. 59).\r\n\r\nHe then points out the difficulty of determining what are species in\r\ncertain large genera, such as Papilio, Ichneumon, etc. How new species\r\narise is shown by observation.\r\n\r\n  \"A number of facts teaches us that in proportion as the individuals\r\n  of one of our species are subjected to changes in situation,\r\n  climate, mode of life or habits, they thereby receive influences\r\n  which gradually change the consistence and the proportions of their\r\n  parts, their form, their faculties, even their structure; so that it\r\n  follows that all of them after a time participate in the changes to\r\n  which they have been subjected.\r\n\r\n  \"In the same climate very different situations and exposures cause\r\n  simple variations in the individuals occurring there; but, after the\r\n  lapse of time, the continual differences of situation of the\r\n  individuals of which I speak, which live and successively reproduce\r\n  under the same circumstances, produce differences in them which\r\n  become, in some degree, essential to their existence, so that at the\r\n  end of many successive generations these individuals, which\r\n  originally belonged to another species, became finally transformed\r\n  into a new species distinct from the other.\r\n\r\n  \"For example, should the seeds of a grass or of any other plant\r\n  natural to a moist field be carried by any means at first to the\r\n  slope of a neighboring hill, where the soil, although more elevated,\r\n  will yet be sufficiently moist to allow the plant to live there, and\r\n  if it results, after having lived there and having passed through\r\n  several generations, that it gradually reaches the dry and almost\r\n  arid soil of a mountain side; if the plant succeeds in living there,\r\n  and perpetuates itself there during a series of generations, it will\r\n  then be so changed that any botanists who should find it there would\r\n  make a distinct species of it.\r\n\r\n  \"The same thing happens in the case of animals which circumstances\r\n  have forced to change in climate, mode of life, and habits; but in\r\n  their case the influences of the causes which I have just cited need\r\n  still more time than the plants to bring about notable changes in\r\n  the individuals.\r\n\r\n  \"The idea of embracing, under the name of _species_, a collection of\r\n  like individuals which are perpetuated by generation, and which have\r\n  remained the same as long as nature has endured, implies the\r\n  necessity that the individuals of one and the same species should\r\n  not cross with individuals of a different species.\r\n\r\n  \"Unfortunately observation has proved, and still proves every day,\r\n  that this consideration is unfounded; for hybrids, very common among\r\n  plants, and the pairings which we often observe between the\r\n  individuals of very different _species_ of animals, have led us to\r\n  see that the limits between these supposed constant species are not\r\n  so fixed as has been imagined.\r\n\r\n  \"In truth, nothing often results from these singular unions,\r\n  especially if they are very ill-assorted, and then the individuals\r\n  which do result from them are usually infertile; but also, when the\r\n  disparities are less great, we know that the default in question\r\n  does not occur.\r\n\r\n  \"But this cause only suffices to create, step by step, varieties\r\n  which finally become races, and which, with time, constitute what we\r\n  call _species_.\r\n\r\n  \"To decide whether the idea which is formed of the _species_ has any\r\n  real foundation, let us return to the considerations which I have\r\n  already explained; they lead us to see:\r\n\r\n  \"1. That all the organized bodies of our globe are true productions\r\n  of Nature, which she has successively formed after the lapse of much\r\n  time;\r\n\r\n  \"2. That, in her course. Nature has begun, and begins over again\r\n  every day, to form the simplest organisms, and that she directly\r\n  creates only those, namely, which are the first germs (_ébauches_)\r\n  of organization, which are designated by the expression of\r\n  _spontaneous generations_;\r\n\r\n  \"3. That the first germs of the animal and plant having been formed\r\n  in appropriate places and circumstances, the faculties of a\r\n  beginning life and of an organic movement established, have\r\n  necessarily gradually developed the organs, and that with time they\r\n  have diversified them, as also the parts;\r\n\r\n  \"4. That the power of growth in each part of the organized body\r\n  being inherent in the first created forms of life, it has given rise\r\n  to different modes of multiplication and of regeneration of\r\n  individuals; and that consequently the progress acquired in the\r\n  composition of the organization and in the shape and diversity of\r\n  the parts has been preserved;\r\n\r\n  \"5. That with the aid of sufficient time, of circumstances which\r\n  have been necessarily favorable, of changes of condition that every\r\n  part of the earth's surface has successively undergone--in a word,\r\n  by the power which new situations and new habits have of modifying\r\n  the organs of living beings, all those which now exist have been\r\n  gradually formed such as we now see them;\r\n\r\n  \"6. Finally, that, according to a similar order of things, living\r\n  beings having undergone each of the more or less great changes in\r\n  the condition of their structure and parts, that which we call a\r\n  _species_ among them has been gradually and successively so formed,\r\n  having only a relative constancy in its condition, and not being as\r\n  old as Nature herself.\r\n\r\n  \"But, it will be said, when it is supposed that by the aid of much\r\n  time and of an infinite variation in circumstances, Nature has\r\n  gradually formed the different animals known to us, shall we not be\r\n  stopped in this supposition by the simple consideration of the\r\n  admirable diversity which we observe in the _instincts_ of different\r\n  animals, and by that of the marvels of every kind presented by their\r\n  different kinds of _industry_?\r\n\r\n  \"Shall we dare to extend the spirit of system so far as to say that\r\n  it is Nature who has herself alone created this astonishing\r\n  diversity of means, of contrivances, of skill, of precautions, of\r\n  patience, of which the _industry_ of animals offers us so many\r\n  examples? What we observe in this respect in the simple class of\r\n  _insects_, is it not a thousand times more than sufficient to make\r\n  us realize that the limit to the power of Nature in nowise permits\r\n  her to herself produce so many marvels, but to force the most\r\n  obstinate philosopher to recognize that here the will of the Supreme\r\n  Author of all things has been necessary, and has alone sufficed to\r\n  create so many admirable things?\r\n\r\n  \"Without doubt, one would be rash or, rather, wholly insensate, to\r\n  pretend to assign limits to the power of the first Author of all\r\n  things; but, aside from that, no one could dare to say that this\r\n  infinite power could not will that which Nature even shows us it has\r\n  willed\"[181] (p. 67).\r\n\r\nReferring to the alleged proof of the fixity of species brought forward\r\nby Cuvier in the _Annales du Muséum d'Histoire naturelle_ (i., pp. 235\r\nand 236) that the mummied birds, crocodiles, and other animals of Egypt\r\npresent no differences from those now living, Lamarck says:\r\n\r\n  \"It would assuredly be very singular if it were otherwise, because\r\n  the position of Egypt and its climate are still almost exactly what\r\n  they were at that epoch. Moreover, the birds which live there still\r\n  exist under the same circumstances as they were then, not having\r\n  been obliged to change their habits.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, who does not perceive that birds, which can so easily\r\n  change their situation and seek places which suit them are less\r\n  subject than many other animals to the variations of local\r\n  circumstances, and hence less restricted in their habits.\"\r\n\r\nHe adds the fact that the animals in question have inhabited Egypt for\r\ntwo or three thousand years, and not necessarily from all time, and that\r\nthis is not time enough for marked changes. He then gives the following\r\ndefinition of species, which is the best ever offered: \"Species, then,\r\nhave only a relative stability, and are invariable only temporarily.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Yet, to facilitate the study and knowledge of so many different\r\n  organisms it is useful to give the name of _species_ to every\r\n  similar collection of similar individuals which are perpetuated by\r\n  heredity (_génération_) in the same condition, so long as the\r\n  circumstances of their situation do not change enough to render\r\n  variable their habits, character, and form.\"\r\n\r\nHe then discusses fossil species in the way already described in\r\nChapter III. (p. 75).\r\n\r\nThe subject of the checks upon over-population by the smaller and weaker\r\nanimals, or the struggle for existence, is thus discussed in\r\nChapter IV.:\r\n\r\n  \"Owing to the extreme multiplication of the small species, and\r\n  especially of the most imperfect animals, the multiplicity of\r\n  individuals might be prejudicial to the preservation of the species,\r\n  to that of the progress acquired in the improvement of the\r\n  organization--in a word, to the general order, if nature had not\r\n  taken precautions to keep this multiplication within due limits over\r\n  which she would never pass.\r\n\r\n  \"Animals devour one another, except those which live only on plants;\r\n  but the latter are exposed to being devoured by the carnivorous\r\n  animals.\r\n\r\n  \"We know that it is the strongest and the best armed which devour\r\n  the weaker, and that the larger kinds devour the smaller.\r\n  Nevertheless, the individuals of a single species rarely devour each\r\n  other: they war upon other races.[182]\r\n\r\n  \"The multiplication of the small species of animals is so\r\n  considerable, and the renewals of their generations are so prompt,\r\n  that these small species would render the earth uninhabitable to the\r\n  others if nature had not set a limit to their prodigious\r\n  multiplication. But since they serve as prey for a multitude of\r\n  other animals, as the length of their life is very limited, and as\r\n  the lowering of the temperature kills them, their numbers are always\r\n  maintained in proper proportions for the preservation of their races\r\n  and that of others.\r\n\r\n  \"As to the larger and stronger animals, they would be too dominant\r\n  and injure the preservation of other races if they should multiply\r\n  in too great proportions. But their races devouring each other, they\r\n  would only multiply slowly and in a small number at a time; this\r\n  would maintain in this respect the kind of equilibrium which should\r\n  exist.\r\n\r\n  \"Finally, only man, considered separately from all which is\r\n  characteristic of him, seems capable of multiplying indefinitely,\r\n  because his intelligence and his resources secure him from seeing\r\n  his increase arrested by the voracity of any animals. He exercises\r\n  over them such a supremacy that, instead of fearing the larger and\r\n  stronger races of animals, he is thus rather capable of destroying\r\n  them, and he continually checks their increase.\r\n\r\n  \"But nature has given him numerous passions, which, unfortunately,\r\n  developing with his intelligence, thus place a great obstacle to\r\n  the extreme multiplication of the individuals of his species.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, it seems as if man had taken it upon himself unceasingly to\r\n  reduce the number of his fellow-creatures; for never, I do not\r\n  hesitate to say, will the earth be covered with the population that\r\n  it could maintain. Several of its habitable parts would always be\r\n  alternately very sparsely populated, although the time for these\r\n  alternate changes would be to us measureless.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus by these wise precautions everything is preserved in the\r\n  established order; the changes and perpetual renewals which are\r\n  observable in this order are maintained within limits over which\r\n  they cannot pass; the races of living beings all subsist in spite of\r\n  their variations; the progress acquired in the improvement of the\r\n  organization is not lost; everything which appears to be disordered,\r\n  overturned, anomalous, reënters unceasingly into the general order,\r\n  and even coöperates with it; and especially and always the will of\r\n  the sublime Author of nature and of all existing things is\r\n  invariably executed\" (pp. 98-101).\r\n\r\nIn the sixth chapter the author treats of the degradation and\r\nsimplification of the structure from one end to the other of the animal\r\nseries, proceeding, as he says, inversely to the general order of\r\nnature, from the compound to the more simple. Why he thus works out this\r\nidea of a general degradation is not very apparent, since it is out of\r\ntune with his views, so often elsewhere expressed, of a progressive\r\nevolution from the simple to the complex, and to his own classification\r\nof the animal kingdom, beginning as it does with the simplest forms and\r\nending with man. Perhaps, however, he temporarily adopts the prevailing\r\nmethod of beginning with the highest forms in order to bring out\r\nclearly the successive steps in inferiority or degradation presented in\r\ndescending the animal scale.\r\n\r\nWe will glean some passages of this chapter which bear on his theory of\r\ndescent. Speaking of the different kinds of aquatic surroundings he\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n  \"In the first place it should be observed that in the waters\r\n  themselves she [Nature] presents considerably diversified\r\n  circumstances; the fresh waters, marine waters, calm or stagnant\r\n  waters, running waters or streams, the waters of warm climates,\r\n  those of cold regions, finally those which are shallow and those\r\n  which are very deep, offer many special circumstances, each of which\r\n  acts differently on the animals living in them. Now, in a degree\r\n  equal to the make-up of the organization, the races of animals which\r\n  are exposed to either of these circumstances have been submitted to\r\n  special influences and have been diversified by them.\"\r\n\r\nHe then, after referring to the general degradation of the Batrachians,\r\ntouches upon the atrophy of legs which has taken place in the snakes:\r\n\r\n  \"If we should consider as a result of _degradation_ the loss of legs\r\n  seen in the snakes, the _Ophidia_ should be regarded as constituting\r\n  the lowest order of reptiles; but it would be an error to admit this\r\n  consideration. Indeed, the serpents being animals which, in order to\r\n  hide themselves, have adopted the habit of gliding directly along\r\n  the ground, their body has lengthened very considerably and\r\n  disproportionately to its thickness. Now, elongated legs proving\r\n  disadvantageous to their necessity of gliding and hiding, very short\r\n  legs, being only four in number, since they are vertebrate animals,\r\n  would be incapable of moving their bodies. Thus the habits of these\r\n  animals have been the cause of the disappearance of their legs, and\r\n  yet the _batrachians_, which have them, offer a more degraded\r\n  organization, and are nearer the fishes\" (p. 155).\r\n\r\nReferring on the next page to the fishes, he remarks:--\r\n\r\n  \"Without doubt their general form, their lack of a constriction\r\n  between the head and the body to form a neck, and the different fins\r\n  which support them in place of legs, are the results of the\r\n  influence of the dense medium which they inhabit, and not that of\r\n  the _dégradation_ of their organization. But this modification\r\n  (_dégradation_) is not less real and very great, as we can convince\r\n  ourselves by examining their internal organs; it is such as to\r\n  compel us to assign to the fishes a rank lower than that of the\r\n  reptiles.\"\r\n\r\nHe then states that the series from the lamprey and fishes to the\r\nmammals is not a regularly gradated one, and accounts for this \"because\r\nthe work of nature has been often changed, hindered, and diverted in\r\ndirection by the influences which singularly different, even contrasted,\r\ncircumstances have exercised on the animals which are there found\r\nexposed in the course of a long series of their renewed generations.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck thus accounts for the production of the radial symmetry of the\r\nmedusæ and echinoderms, his _Radiaires_. At the present day this\r\nsymmetry is attributed perhaps more correctly to their more or less\r\nfixed mode of life.\r\n\r\n  \"It is without doubt by the result of this means which nature\r\n  employs, at first with a feeble energy with _polyps_, and then with\r\n  greater developments in the _Radiata_, that the radial form has been\r\n  acquired; because the subtile ambient fluids, penetrating by the\r\n  alimentary canal, and being expansive, have been able, by an\r\n  incessantly renewed repulsion from the centre towards every point of\r\n  the circumference, to give rise to this radiated arrangement of\r\n  parts.\r\n\r\n  \"It is by this cause that, in the Radiata, the intestinal canal,\r\n  although still very imperfect, since more often it has only a single\r\n  opening, is yet complicated with numerous radiating vasculiform,\r\n  often ramified, appendages.\r\n\r\n  \"It is, doubtless, also by this cause that in the soft Radiates, as\r\n  the medusæ, etc., we observe a constant isochronic movement,\r\n  movement very probably resulting from the successive intermissions\r\n  between the masses of subtile fluids which penetrate into the\r\n  interior of these animals and those of the same fluids which escape\r\n  from it, often being spread throughout all their parts.\r\n\r\n  \"We cannot say that the isochronic movements of the soft Radiates\r\n  are the result of their respiration; for below the vertebrate\r\n  animals nature does not offer, in that of any animal, these\r\n  alternate and measured movements of inspiration and expiration.\r\n  Whatever may be the respiration of Radiates, it is extremely slow,\r\n  and is executed without perceptible movements\" (p. 200).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Influence of Circumstances on the Actions and Habits of Animals._\r\n\r\nIt is in Chapter VII. that the views of Lamarck are more fully presented\r\nthan elsewhere, and we therefore translate all of it as literally as\r\npossible, so as to preserve the exact sense of the author.\r\n\r\n  \"We do not here have to do with a line of argument, but with the\r\n  examination of a positive fact, which is more general than is\r\n  supposed, and which has not received the attention it deserves,\r\n  doubtless because, very often, it is quite difficult to discover.\r\n  This fact consists in the influence which circumstances exert on the\r\n  different organisms subjected to them.\r\n\r\n  \"In truth, for a long time there has been noticed the influence of\r\n  different states of our organization on our character, our\r\n  propensities (_penchants_), our actions, and even our ideas; but it\r\n  seems to me that no one has yet recognized that of our actions and\r\n  of our habits on our organization itself. Now, as these actions and\r\n  these habits entirely depend on the circumstances in which we\r\n  habitually find ourselves, I shall try to show how great is the\r\n  influence which these circumstances exercise on the general form, on\r\n  the condition of the parts, and even on the organization of living\r\n  bodies. It is therefore this very positive fact which is to be the\r\n  subject of this chapter.\r\n\r\n  \"If we have not had numerous occasions to plainly recognize the\r\n  effects of this influence on certain organisms which we have\r\n  transported under entirely new and different circumstances, and if\r\n  we had not seen these effects and the changes resulting from them\r\n  produced, in a way, under our very eyes, the important fact in\r\n  question would have always remained unknown.\r\n\r\n  \"The influence of circumstances is really continuously and\r\n  everywhere active on living beings, but what renders it difficult\r\n  for us to appreciate this influence is that its effects only become\r\n  sensible or recognizable (especially in the animals) at the end of a\r\n  long period.\r\n\r\n  \"Before stating and examining the proofs of this fact, which\r\n  deserves our attention, and which is very important for a zoölogical\r\n  philosophy, let us resume the thread of the considerations we had\r\n  begun to discuss.\r\n\r\n  \"In the preceding paragraph we have seen that it is now an\r\n  incontrovertible fact that, in considering the animal scale in a\r\n  sense the inverse of that of nature, we find that there exists in\r\n  the groups composing this scale a continuous but irregular\r\n  modification (_dégradation_) in the organization of animals which\r\n  they comprise, an increasing simplification in the organization of\r\n  these organisms; finally, a proportionate diminution in the number\r\n  of faculties of these beings.\r\n\r\n  \"This fact once recognized may throw the greatest light on the very\r\n  order which nature has followed in the production of all the\r\n  existing animals; but it does not show why the structure of animals\r\n  in its increasing complexity from the more imperfect up to the most\r\n  perfect offers only an irregular gradation, whose extent presents a\r\n  number of anomalies or digressions which have no appearance of order\r\n  in their diversity.\r\n\r\n  \"Now, in seeking for the reason of this singular irregularity in the\r\n  increasing complexity of organization of animals, if we should\r\n  consider the outcome of the influences that the infinitely\r\n  diversified circumstances in all parts of the globe exercise on the\r\n  general form, the parts, and the very organization of these animals,\r\n  everything will be clearly explained.\r\n\r\n  \"It will, indeed, be evident that the condition in which we find all\r\n  animals is, on one side, the result of the increasing complexity of\r\n  the organization which tends to form a regular gradation, and, on\r\n  the other, that it is that of the influences of a multitude of very\r\n  different circumstances which continually tend to destroy the\r\n  regularity in the gradations of the increasing complexity of the\r\n  organization.\r\n\r\n  \"Here it becomes necessary for me to explain the meaning I attach to\r\n  the expression _circumstances influencing the form and structure of\r\n  animals_--namely, that in becoming very different they change, with\r\n  time, both their form and organization by proportionate\r\n  modifications.\r\n\r\n  \"Assuredly, if these expressions should be taken literally, I should\r\n  be accused of an error; for whatever may be the circumstances, they\r\n  do not directly cause any modification in the form and structure of\r\n  animals.\r\n\r\n  \"But the great changes in the circumstances bring about in animals\r\n  great changes in their needs, and such changes in their needs\r\n  necessarily cause changes in their actions. Now, if the new needs\r\n  become constant or very permanent, the animals then assume new\r\n  _habits_, which are as durable as the needs which gave origin to\r\n  them. We see that this is easily demonstrated and even does not need\r\n  any explanation to make it clearer.\r\n\r\n  \"It is then evident that a great change in circumstances having\r\n  become constant in a race of animals leads these animals into new\r\n  habits.\r\n\r\n  \"Now, if new circumstances, having become permanent in a race of\r\n  animals, have given to these animals new _habits_--that is to say,\r\n  have led them to perform new actions which have become\r\n  habitual--there will from this result the use of such a part by\r\n  preference to that of another, and in certain cases the total lack\r\n  of use of any part which has become useless.\r\n\r\n  \"Nothing of all this should be considered as a hypothesis or as a\r\n  mere peculiar opinion; they are, on the contrary, truths which\r\n  require, in order to be made evident, only attention to and the\r\n  observation of facts.\r\n\r\n  \"We shall see presently by the citation of known facts which prove\r\n  it, on one side that the new wants, having rendered such a part\r\n  necessary, have really by the result of efforts given origin to this\r\n  part, and that as the result of its sustained use it has gradually\r\n  strengthened it, developed, and has ended in considerably increasing\r\n  its size; on the other side we shall see that, in certain cases, the\r\n  new circumstances and new wants having rendered such a part wholly\r\n  useless, the total lack of use of this part has led to the result\r\n  that it has gradually ceased to receive the development which the\r\n  other parts of the animal obtain; that it gradually becomes\r\n  emaciated and thin; and that finally, when this lack of use has been\r\n  total during a long time, the part in question ends in disappearing.\r\n  All this is a positive fact; I propose to give the most convincing\r\n  proofs.\r\n\r\n  \"In the plants, where there are no movements, and, consequently, no\r\n  habits properly so called, great changes in circumstances do not\r\n  bring about less great differences in the development of their\r\n  parts; so that these differences originate and develop certain of\r\n  them, while they reduce and cause several others to disappear. But\r\n  here everything operates by the changes occurring in the nutrition\r\n  of the plant, in its absorptions and transpirations, in the amount\r\n  of heat, light, air, and humidity which it habitually receives;\r\n  finally, in the superiority that certain of the different vital\r\n  movements may assume over others.\r\n\r\n  \"Between individuals of the same species, some of which are\r\n  constantly well nourished, and in circumstances favorable to their\r\n  entire development, while the others live under reversed\r\n  circumstances, there is brought about a difference in the condition\r\n  of these individuals which gradually becomes very remarkable. How\r\n  many examples could I not cite regarding animals and plants, which\r\n  would confirm the grounds for this view! Now, if the circumstances\r\n  remain the same, rendering habitual and constant the condition of\r\n  individuals badly fed, diseased, or languishing, their internal\r\n  organization becomes finally modified, and reproduction between the\r\n  individuals in question preserves the acquired modifications, and\r\n  ends in giving rise to a race very distinct from that of the\r\n  individuals which unceasingly meet with circumstances favorable to\r\n  their development.\r\n\r\n  \"A very dry spring-time is the cause of the grass of a field growing\r\n  very slowly, remaining scraggy and puny, flowering and fruiting\r\n  without growing much.\r\n\r\n  \"A spring interspersed with warm days and rainy days makes the same\r\n  grass grow rapidly, and the harvest of hay is then excellent.\r\n\r\n  \"But if any cause perpetuates the unfavorable circumstances\r\n  surrounding these plants, they vary proportionally, at first in\r\n  their appearance and general condition, and finally in several\r\n  particulars of their characters.\r\n\r\n  \"For example, if some seed of any of the grasses referred to should\r\n  be carried into an elevated place, on a dry and stony greensward\r\n  much exposed to the winds, and should germinate there, the plant\r\n  which should be able to live in this place would always be badly\r\n  nourished, and the individuals reproduced there continuing to exist\r\n  under these depressing circumstances, there would result a race\r\n  truly different from that living in the field, though originating\r\n  from it. The individuals of this new race would be small, scraggy,\r\n  and some of their organs, having developed more than others, would\r\n  then offer special proportions.\r\n\r\n  \"Those who have observed much, and who have consulted the great\r\n  collections, have become convinced that in proportion as the\r\n  circumstances of habitat, exposure, climate, food, mode of life,\r\n  etc., come to change, the characters of size, form, proportion\r\n  between the parts, color, consistence, agility, and industry in the\r\n  animals change proportionally.\r\n\r\n  \"What nature accomplishes after a long time, we bring about every\r\n  day by suddenly changing, in the case of a living plant, the\r\n  circumstances under which it and all the individuals of its species\r\n  exist.\r\n\r\n  \"All botanists know that the plants which they transplant from their\r\n  birthplace into gardens for cultivation gradually undergo changes\r\n  which at last render them unrecognizable. Many plants naturally\r\n  very hairy then become glabrous, or almost so; many of those which\r\n  were creeping and trailing, then become erect; others lose their\r\n  spines or their prickles; others still, from the woody and perennial\r\n  condition which their stem possesses in a warm climate, pass, in our\r\n  climate, into an herbaceous condition, and among these several are\r\n  nothing more than annual plants; finally, the dimensions of their\r\n  parts themselves undergo very considerable changes. These effects of\r\n  changes of circumstances are so well known that botanists prefer not\r\n  to describe garden plants, at least only those which have been newly\r\n  cultivated.\r\n\r\n  \"Is not cultivated wheat (_Triticum sativum_) only a plant brought\r\n  by man into the condition in which we actually see it? Who can tell\r\n  me in what country such a plant lives in a state of nature--that is\r\n  to say, without being there the result of its culture in some\r\n  neighboring region?\r\n\r\n  \"Where occur in nature our cabbage, lettuce, etc., in the condition\r\n  in which we see them in our kitchen-gardens? Is it not the same as\r\n  regards a number of animals which domestication has changed or\r\n  considerably modified?\r\n\r\n  \"What very different races among our fowls and domestic pigeons,\r\n  which we have obtained by raising them in different circumstances\r\n  and in different countries, and how vainly do we now endeavor to\r\n  rediscover them in nature!\r\n\r\n  \"Those which are the least changed, without doubt by a more recent\r\n  process of domestication, and because they do not live in a climate\r\n  which is foreign to them, do not the less possess, in the condition\r\n  of some of their parts, great differences produced by the habits\r\n  which we have made them contract. Thus our ducks and our domestic\r\n  geese trace back their type to the wild ducks and geese; but ours\r\n  have lost the power of rising into the high regions of the air, and\r\n  of flying over extensive regions; finally, a decided change has\r\n  been wrought in the state of their parts compared with that of\r\n  animals of the race from which they have descended.\r\n\r\n  \"Who does not know that such a native bird, which we raise in a cage\r\n  and which lives there five or six years in succession, and after\r\n  that replaced in nature--namely, set free--is then unable to fly\r\n  like its fellows which have always been free? The slight change of\r\n  circumstance operating on this individual has only diminished its\r\n  power of flight, and doubtless has not produced any change in the\r\n  shape of its parts. But if a numerous series of generations of\r\n  individuals of the same race should have been kept in captivity for\r\n  a considerable time, there is no doubt but that even the form of the\r\n  parts of these individuals would gradually undergo notable changes.\r\n  For a much stronger reason, if, instead of a simple captivity\r\n  constantly maintained over them, this circumstance had been at the\r\n  same time accompanied by a change to a very different climate, and\r\n  if these individuals by degrees had been habituated to other kinds\r\n  of food, and to other kinds of movements to obtain it; certainly\r\n  these circumstances, united and becoming constant, would insensibly\r\n  form a new and special race.\r\n\r\n  \"Where do we find, in nature, this multitude of races of _dogs_,\r\n  which, as the result of domesticity to which we have reduced these\r\n  animals, have been brought into their present condition? Where do we\r\n  find these bull-dogs, greyhounds, water spaniels, spaniels,\r\n  pug-dogs, etc., etc., races which present among themselves much\r\n  greater differences than those which we admit to be specific in wild\r\n  animals of the same genus?\r\n\r\n  \"Without doubt, a primitive single race, very near the wolf, if it\r\n  is not itself the true type, has been submitted by man, at some\r\n  period, to the process of domestication. This race, which then\r\n  offered no difference between its individuals, has been gradually\r\n  dispersed by man into different countries, with different climates;\r\n  and after a time these same individuals, having undergone the\r\n  influences of their habitats, and of the different habits they were\r\n  obliged to contract in each country, have undergone remarkable\r\n  changes, and have formed different special races. Now, the man who,\r\n  for commercial reasons or from interests of any other kind, travels\r\n  a very great distance, having carried into a densely populated\r\n  place, as for example a great capital, different races of dogs\r\n  originated in some very distant country, then the increase of these\r\n  races by heredity (_génération_) has given rise successively to all\r\n  those we now know.\r\n\r\n  \"The following fact proves, as regards plants, how a change in any\r\n  important circumstance leads to a change in the parts of their\r\n  organisms.\r\n\r\n  \"So long as _Ranunculus aquatilis_ is submerged in the water, its\r\n  leaves are all finely incised and the divisions hair-like; but when\r\n  the stalks of this plant reach the surface of the water, the leaves\r\n  which grow out in the air are wider, rounded, and simply lobed. If\r\n  some feet from the same plant the roots succeed in pushing into a\r\n  soil only damp, without being submerged, their stalks then are\r\n  short, none of their leaves are divided into capillary divisions,\r\n  which gives rise to _Ranunculus hederaceus_, which the botanists\r\n  regard as a species whenever they meet with it.\r\n\r\n  \"There is no doubt that as regards animals important changes in the\r\n  circumstances under which they are accustomed to live do not produce\r\n  alteration in their organs; for here the changes are much slower in\r\n  operating than in plants, and, consequently, are to us less marked,\r\n  and their cause less recognizable.\r\n\r\n  \"As to the circumstances which have so much power in modifying the\r\n  organs of living beings, the most influential are, doubtless, the\r\n  diversity of the surroundings in which they live; but besides this\r\n  there are many others which, in addition, have a considerable\r\n  influence in the production of the effects in question.\r\n\r\n  \"It is known that different localities change in nature and quality\r\n  owing to their position, their nature, and their climate, as is\r\n  easily seen in passing over different places distinguished by\r\n  special features; hence we see a cause of variation for the animals\r\n  and plants which live in these different places. But what we do not\r\n  sufficiently know, and even what we generally refuse to believe, is\r\n  that each place itself changes with time in exposure, in climate, in\r\n  nature, and quality, although with a slowness so great in relation\r\n  to our own continuance that we attribute to it a perfect stability.\r\n\r\n  \"Now, in either case, these changed localities proportionally change\r\n  the circumstances relative to the organisms which inhabit them, and\r\n  the latter then give rise to other influences bearing on these same\r\n  beings.\r\n\r\n  \"We perceive from this that, if there are extremes in these changes,\r\n  there are also gradations--namely, degrees which are intermediate\r\n  and which fill the interval. Consequently there are also gradations\r\n  in the differences which distinguish what we call _species_.\r\n\r\n  \"It is then evident that the whole surface of the earth offers, in\r\n  the nature and situation of the matters which occupy its different\r\n  points, a diversity of circumstances which is throughout in relation\r\n  with that of the forms and parts of animals, independent of the\r\n  special diversity which necessarily results from the progress of the\r\n  composition of organization in each animal.\r\n\r\n  \"In each locality where animals can live, the circumstances which\r\n  establish there an order of things remain for a long time the same,\r\n  and really change there only with a slowness so great that man\r\n  cannot directly notice them. He is obliged to consult monuments to\r\n  recognize that in each one of these places the order of things that\r\n  he discovers there has not always been the same, and to perceive\r\n  that it will change more.\r\n\r\n  \"The races of animals which live in each of these places should,\r\n  then, retain their customary habits there also for a long time;\r\n  hence to us seems an apparent constancy of races which we call\r\n  _species_--constancy which has originated among us the idea that\r\n  these races are as ancient as nature.\r\n\r\n  \"But in the different points of the earth's surface which can be\r\n  inhabited, nature and the situation of the places and climates\r\n  constitute there, for the animals as for the plants, _different\r\n  circumstances_ of all sorts of degrees. The animals which inhabit\r\n  these different places should then differ from each other, not only\r\n  on account of the state of nature of the organization in each race,\r\n  but, besides, by reason of the habits that the individuals of each\r\n  race there are forced to have; so, in proportion as he traverses the\r\n  larger parts of the earth's surface the observing naturalist sees\r\n  circumstances changing in a manner somewhat noticeable; he\r\n  constantly sees that the species change proportionately in their\r\n  characters.\r\n\r\n  \"Now, the true order of things necessary to consider in all this\r\n  consists in recognizing:\r\n\r\n  \"1. That every slight change maintained under the circumstances\r\n  where occur each race of animals, brings about in them a real change\r\n  in their wants.\r\n\r\n  \"2. That every change in the wants of animals necessitates in them\r\n  other movements (_actions_) to satisfy the new needs, and\r\n  consequently other habits.\r\n\r\n  \"3. That every new want necessitating new actions to satisfy it,\r\n  demands of the animal which feels it both the more frequent use of\r\n  such of its parts of which before it made less use, which develops\r\n  and considerably enlarges them, and the use of new parts which\r\n  necessity has caused to insensibly develop in it by the effects of\r\n  its inner feelings; which I shall constantly prove by known facts.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus, to arrive at a knowledge of the true causes of so many\r\n  different forms and so many different habits of which the known\r\n  animals offer us examples, it is necessary to consider that\r\n  circumstances infinitely diversified, but all slowly changing, into\r\n  which the animals of each race are successively thrown, have caused,\r\n  for each of them, new wants and necessarily changes in their habits.\r\n  Moreover, this truth, which cannot be denied, being once recognized,\r\n  it will be easy to see how the new needs have been able to be\r\n  satisfied, and the new habits formed, if any attention be given to\r\n  the two following laws of nature, which observation always confirms:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_First Law._\r\n\r\n  \"In every animal which has not exceeded the term of its development,\r\n  the more frequent and sustained use of any organ gradually\r\n  strengthens this organ, develops and enlarges it, and gives it a\r\n  strength proportioned to the length of time of such use; while the\r\n  constant lack of use of such an organ imperceptibly weakens it,\r\n  causes it to become reduced, progressively diminishes its faculties,\r\n  and ends in its disappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_Second Law._\r\n\r\n  \"Everything which nature has caused individuals to acquire or lose\r\n  by the influence of the circumstances to which their race may be for\r\n  a long time exposed, and consequently by the influence of the\r\n  predominant use of such an organ, or by that of the constant lack of\r\n  use of such part, it preserves by heredity (_génération_) and passes\r\n  on to the new individuals which descend from it, provided that the\r\n  changes thus acquired are common to both sexes, or to those which\r\n  have given origin to these new individuals.\r\n\r\n  \"These are the two fundamental truths which can be misunderstood\r\n  only by those who have never observed or followed nature in its\r\n  operations, or only by those who allow themselves to fall into the\r\n  error which I have combated.\r\n\r\n  \"Naturalists having observed that the forms of the parts of animals\r\n  compared with the uses of these parts are always in perfect accord,\r\n  have thought that the forms and conditions of parts have caused the\r\n  function; but this is a mistake, for it is easy to demonstrate by\r\n  observation that it is, on the contrary, the needs and uses of\r\n  organs which have developed these same parts, which have even given\r\n  origin to them where they did not exist, and which consequently have\r\n  given rise to the condition in which we observe them in each animal.\r\n\r\n  \"If this were not so, it would have been necessary for nature to\r\n  have created for the parts of animals as many forms as the diversity\r\n  of circumstances in which they have to live had required, and that\r\n  these forms and also the circumstances had never varied.\r\n\r\n  \"This is certainly not the existing order of things, and if it were\r\n  really such, we should not have the race-horses of England; we\r\n  should not have our great draft horses, so clumsy and so different\r\n  from the first named, for nature herself has not produced their\r\n  like; we should not, for the same reason, have terrier dogs with bow\r\n  legs, greyhounds so swift in running, water-spaniels, etc.; we\r\n  should not have tailless fowls, fantail pigeons, etc.; finally, we\r\n  could cultivate the wild plants as much as we pleased in the rich\r\n  and fertile soil of our gardens without fearing to see them change\r\n  by long culture.\r\n\r\n  \"For a long time we have felt the force of the saying which has\r\n  passed into the well-known proverb--_habits form a second nature_.\r\n\r\n  \"Assuredly, if the habits and nature of each animal can never vary,\r\n  the proverb is false, has no foundation, and does not apply to the\r\n  instances which led to its being spoken.\r\n\r\n  \"If we should seriously consider all that I have just stated, it\r\n  might be thought that I had good reason when in my work entitled\r\n  _Recherches sur les Corps vivans_ (p. 50) I established the\r\n  following proposition:\r\n\r\n  \"'It is not the organs--that is to say, the nature and form of the\r\n  parts of the body of an animal--which have given rise to its habits\r\n  and its special faculties; but it is, on the contrary, its habits,\r\n  its manner of life, and the circumstances in which are placed the\r\n  individuals from which it originates, which have, with time, brought\r\n  about the form of its body, the number and condition of its organs,\r\n  finally, the faculties which it enjoys.'\r\n\r\n  \"If we weigh this proposition, and if we recall all the observations\r\n  which nature and the state of things continually lead us to do, then\r\n  its importance and its solidity will become more evident.\r\n\r\n  \"Time and favorable circumstances are, as I have already said, the\r\n  two principal means which nature employs to give existence to all\r\n  her productions: we know that time for her has no limits, and that\r\n  consequently it is ever at her disposal.\r\n\r\n  \"As to the circumstances of which she has need, and which she uses\r\n  still daily to cause variations in all that she continues to\r\n  produce, we can say that they are, in some degree, for her\r\n  inexhaustible.\r\n\r\n  \"The principal circumstances arise from the influence of climate;\r\n  from those of different temperatures of the atmosphere, and from all\r\n  the environing media; from that of the diversity of different\r\n  localities and their situation; from that of habits, the ordinary\r\n  movements, the most frequent actions; finally, from that of means of\r\n  preservation, of mode of living, of defence, of reproduction, etc.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, owing to these diverse influences, the faculties increase\r\n  and become stronger by use, become differentiated by the new habits\r\n  preserved for long ages, and insensibly the organization, the\r\n  consistence--in a word, the nature and condition of parts, as also\r\n  of the organs--participate in the results of all these influences,\r\n  become preserved, and are propagated by generation.\r\n\r\n  \"These truths, which are only the results of the two natural laws\r\n  above stated, are in every case completely confirmed by facts; they\r\n  clearly indicate the course of nature in all the diversity of its\r\n  products.\r\n\r\n  \"But instead of contenting ourselves with generalities which might\r\n  be considered as hypothetical, let us directly examine the facts,\r\n  and consider, in the animals, the result of the use or disuse of\r\n  their organs on the organs themselves, according to the habits that\r\n  each race has been compelled to contract.\r\n\r\n  \"I shall now attempt to prove that the constant lack of exercise of\r\n  organs at first diminishes their faculties, gradually impoverishes\r\n  them, and ends by making them disappear, or even causing them to be\r\n  atrophied, if this lack of use is perpetuated for a very long time\r\n  through successive generations of animals of the same race.\r\n\r\n  \"I shall next prove that, on the contrary, the habit of exercising\r\n  an organ, in every animal which has not attained the limit of the\r\n  diminution of its faculties, not only perfects and increases the\r\n  faculties of this organ, but, besides, enables it to acquire\r\n  developments and dimensions which insensibly change it; so that with\r\n  time it renders it very different from the same organ in another\r\n  animal which exercises it much less.\r\n\r\n  \"_The lack of use of an organ, become constant by the habits formed,\r\n  gradually impoverishes this organ, and ends by causing it to\r\n  disappear and even to destroy it._\r\n\r\n  \"As such a proposition can only be admitted on proof, and not by its\r\n  simple announcement, let us prove it by the citation of the leading\r\n  known facts on which it is based.\r\n\r\n  \"The vertebrate animals, whose plan of organization is in all nearly\r\n  the same, although they offer much diversity in their parts, have\r\n  jaws armed with _teeth_; moreover, those among them which\r\n  circumstances have placed in the habit of swallowing their food\r\n  without previous _mastication_ are exposed to the result that their\r\n  teeth become undeveloped. These teeth, then, either remain concealed\r\n  between the bony edges of the jaws, without appearing above, or even\r\n  their gums are found to have been atrophied.\r\n\r\n  \"In the baleen whales, which have been supposed to be completely\r\n  deprived of teeth, M. Geoffroy has found them concealed in the jaws\r\n  of the _foetus_ of this animal. This professor has also found in\r\n  the birds the groove where the teeth should be situated; but they\r\n  are no longer to be seen there.\r\n\r\n  \"In the class even of mammals, which comprises the most perfect\r\n  animals, and chiefly those in which the vertebrate plan of\r\n  organization is most perfectly carried out, not only the baleen has\r\n  no usable teeth, but the ant-eater (_Myrmecophaga_) is also in the\r\n  same condition, whose habit of not masticating its food has been for\r\n  a long time established and preserved in its race.\r\n\r\n  \"The presence of eyes in the head is a characteristic of a great\r\n  number of different animals, and becomes an essential part of the\r\n  plan of organization of vertebrates.\r\n\r\n  \"Nevertheless the mole, which owing to its habits makes very little\r\n  use of vision, has only very small eyes, which are scarcely visible,\r\n  since they exercise these organs to a very slight extent.\r\n\r\n  \"The _Aspalax_ of Olivier (_Voyage en Egypte et en Perse_, ii.\r\n  pl. 28 f. 2), which lives under ground like the mole, and which\r\n  probably exposes itself still less than that animal to the light of\r\n  day, has totally lost the power of sight; also it possesses only\r\n  vestiges of the organ of which it is the seat; and yet these\r\n  vestiges are wholly concealed under the skin and other parts which\r\n  cover them, and do not permit the least access to the light.\r\n\r\n  \"The _Proteus_, an aquatic reptile allied to the salamander in its\r\n  structure, and which lives in the dark subterranean waters of deep\r\n  caves, has, like the _Aspalax_, only vestiges of the organs of\r\n  sight--vestiges which are covered and concealed in the same manner.\r\n\r\n  \"We turn to a decisive consideration relative to this question.\r\n\r\n  \"Light does not penetrate everywhere; consequently animals which\r\n  habitually live in situations where it does not penetrate lack the\r\n  occasion of exercising the organs of sight, if nature has provided\r\n  them with them. Moreover, the animals which make part of the plan of\r\n  organization in which _eyes_ are necessarily present, have\r\n  originally had them. However, since we find them among those which\r\n  are deprived of the use of this organ, and which have only vestiges\r\n  concealed and covered over, it should be evident that the\r\n  impoverishment and even the disappearance of these organs are the\r\n  result of a constant lack of exercise.\r\n\r\n  \"What proves it is that the organ of _hearing_ is never in this\r\n  condition, and that we always find it in the animals when the nature\r\n  of their organization should require its existence; the reason is as\r\n  follows.\r\n\r\n  \"The _cause of sound_, that which, moved by the shock or the\r\n  vibrations of bodies, transmits to the organ of hearing the\r\n  impression which it receives, penetrates everywhere, traverses all\r\n  the media, and even the mass of the densest bodies: from this it\r\n  results that every animal which makes a part of a plan of\r\n  organization to which _hearing_ is essential, has always occasion to\r\n  exercise this organ in whatever situation it lives. So, among the\r\n  _vertebrate animals_ we see none deprived of their organs of\r\n  hearing; but in the groups below them, when the same organs are once\r\n  wanting, we do not again find them.\r\n\r\n  \"It is not so with the organ of sight, for we see this organ\r\n  disappear, reappear, and again disappear, in proportion to the\r\n  possibility or impossibility of the animal's exercising it.\r\n\r\n  \"In the _acephalous molluscs_, the great development of the mantle\r\n  of these molluscs has rendered their eyes and even their head\r\n  entirely useless. These organs, also forming a part of a plan of\r\n  organization which should comprise them, have disappeared and\r\n  atrophied from constant lack of use.\r\n\r\n  \"Finally, it is a part of the plan of organization of _reptiles_, as\r\n  in other vertebrate animals, to have four legs appended to their\r\n  skeleton. The serpents should consequently have four, though they do\r\n  not form the lowest order of reptiles, and are not so near the\r\n  fishes as the batrachians (the frogs, the salamanders, etc.).\r\n\r\n  \"However, the serpents having taken up the habit of gliding along\r\n  the ground, and of concealing themselves in the grass, their body,\r\n  owing to continually repeated efforts to elongate itself so as to\r\n  pass through narrow spaces, has acquired a considerable length\r\n  disproportionate to its size. Moreover, limbs would have been very\r\n  useless to these animals, and consequently would not have been\r\n  employed: because long legs would have interfered with their need of\r\n  gliding, and very short legs, not being more than four in number,\r\n  would have been incapable of moving their body. Hence the lack of\r\n  use of these parts having been constant in the races of these\r\n  animals, has caused the total disappearance of these same parts,\r\n  although really included in the plan of organization of the animals\r\n  of their class.\r\n\r\n  \"Many insects which by the natural character of their order, and\r\n  even of their genus, should have wings, lack them more or less\r\n  completely from disuse. A quantity of Coleoptera, Orthoptera,\r\n  Hymenoptera, and of Hemiptera, etc., afford examples; the habits of\r\n  these animals do not require them to make use of their wings.\r\n\r\n  \"But it is not sufficient to give the explanation of the cause which\r\n  has brought about the condition of the organs of different\r\n  animals--a condition which we see to be always the same in those of\r\n  the same species; we must besides observe the changes of condition\r\n  produced in the organs of one and the same individual during its\r\n  life, by the single result of a great change in the special habits\r\n  in the individuals of its species. The following fact, which is one\r\n  of the most remarkable, will serve to prove the influence of habits\r\n  on the condition of organs, and show how changes wrought in the\r\n  habits of an individual, produce the condition of the organs which\r\n  are brought into action during the exercise of these habits.\r\n\r\n  \"M. Tenon, member of the Institute, has given an account to the\r\n  Class of Sciences, that having examined the intestinal canal of\r\n  several men who had been hard drinkers all their lives, he had\r\n  constantly found it to be shortened to an extraordinary extent,\r\n  compared with the same organ in those not given to such a habit.\r\n\r\n  \"We know that hard drinkers, or those who are addicted to\r\n  drunkenness, take very little solid food, that they eat very\r\n  lightly, and that the beverage which they take in excess frequently\r\n  suffices to nourish them.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, as fluid aliments, especially spirituous liquors, do not\r\n  remain a long time either in the stomach or in the intestines, the\r\n  stomach and the remainder of the intestinal canal lose the habit of\r\n  being distended in intemperate persons, so also in sedentary persons\r\n  and those engaged in mental labor, who are habituated to take but\r\n  little food. Gradually and at length their stomach becomes\r\n  contracted, and their intestines shortened.\r\n\r\n  \"We are not concerned here with the shrinkage and shortening\r\n  produced by a puckering of the parts, which permit ordinary\r\n  extension, if instead of a continued emptiness these viscera should\r\n  be filled; the shrinkage and shortening in question are real,\r\n  considerable, and such that these organs would burst open rather\r\n  than yield suddenly to the causes which would require ordinary\r\n  extension.\r\n\r\n  \"In circumstances of persons of the same age, compare a man who, in\r\n  order to devote himself to habitual study and mental work, which\r\n  have rendered his digestion more difficult, has contracted the habit\r\n  of eating lightly, with another who habitually takes a good deal of\r\n  exercise, walks out often, and eats heartily; the stomach of the\r\n  first will be weakened, and a small quantity of food will fill it,\r\n  while that of the second will be not only maintained in its ordinary\r\n  health but even strengthened.\r\n\r\n  \"We have here the case of an organ much modified in its dimensions\r\n  and in its faculties by the single cause of a change in habits\r\n  during the life of the individual.\r\n\r\n  \"_The frequent use of an organ become constant by habit increases\r\n  the faculties of this organ, even develops it, and enables it to\r\n  acquire dimensions and a power of action which it does not possess\r\n  in animals which exercise less._\r\n\r\n  \"We have just said that the lack of employment of an organ which\r\n  necessarily exists modifies it, impoverishes it, and ends by its\r\n  disappearing entirely.\r\n\r\n  \"I shall now demonstrate that the continued employment of an organ,\r\n  with the efforts made to draw out its powers under circumstances\r\n  where it would be of service, strengthens, extends, and enlarges\r\n  this organ, or creates a new one which can exercise the necessary\r\n  functions.\r\n\r\n  \"The bird which necessity drives to the water to find there prey\r\n  fitted for its sustenance, opens the digits of its feet when it\r\n  wishes to strike the water and propel itself along its surface. The\r\n  skin which unites these digits at their base, by these acts of\r\n  spreading apart being unceasingly repeated contracts the habit of\r\n  extending; so that after a while the broad membranes which connect\r\n  the digits of ducks, geese, etc., are formed as we see them. The\r\n  same efforts made in swimming--_i.e._, in pushing back the water, in\r\n  order to advance and to move in this liquid--have likewise extended\r\n  the membrane situated between the digits of the frogs, the\r\n  sea-turtles, the otter, beaver, etc.\r\n\r\n  \"On the contrary, the bird whose mode of life habituates it to perch\r\n  on trees, and which is born of individuals who have all contracted\r\n  this habit, has necessarily the digits of the feet longer and shaped\r\n  in another way than those of the aquatic animals which I have just\r\n  mentioned. Its claws, after a while, became elongated, pointed, and\r\n  curved or hook-like in order to grasp the branches on which the\r\n  animal often rests.\r\n\r\n  \"Likewise we see that the shore bird, which is not inclined to swim,\r\n  and which moreover has need of approaching the edge of the water to\r\n  find there its prey, is in continual danger of sinking in the mud.\r\n  Now, this bird, wishing to act so that its body shall not fall into\r\n  the water, makes every effort to extend and elongate its legs. It\r\n  results from this that the long-continued habit that this bird and\r\n  the others of its race contract, of extending and continually\r\n  elongating their legs, is the _cause_ of the individuals of this\r\n  race being raised as if on stilts, having gradually acquired long,\r\n  naked legs, which are denuded of feathers up to the thighs and often\r\n  above them (_Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres_, p. 16).\r\n\r\n  \"We also perceive that the same bird, wishing to catch fish without\r\n  wetting its body, is obliged to make continual efforts to lengthen\r\n  its neck. Now, the results of these habitual efforts in this\r\n  individual and in those of its race have enabled them, after a\r\n  time, to singularly elongate them--as, indeed, is proved by the long\r\n  neck of all shore birds.\r\n\r\n  \"If any swimming birds, such as the swan and the goose, whose legs\r\n  are short, nevertheless have a very long neck, it is because these\r\n  birds in swimming on the surface of the water have the habit of\r\n  plunging their head down as far as they can, to catch aquatic larvæ\r\n  and different animalcules for food, and because they make no effort\r\n  to lengthen their legs.\r\n\r\n  \"When an animal to satisfy its wants makes repeated efforts to\r\n  elongate its tongue, it will acquire a considerable length (the\r\n  ant-eater, green wood-pecker); when it is obliged to seize anything\r\n  with this same organ, then its tongue will divide and become forked.\r\n  That of the humming-birds, which seize with their tongue, and that\r\n  of the lizard and serpents, which use it to feel and examine objects\r\n  in front of them, are proofs of what I advocate.\r\n\r\n  \"Wants, always occasioned by circumstances, and followed by\r\n  sustained efforts to satisfy them, are not limited in results, in\r\n  modifying--that is to say, in increasing or diminishing--the extent\r\n  and the faculties of organs; but they also come to displace these\r\n  same organs when certain of these wants become a necessity.\r\n\r\n  \"The fishes which habitually swim in large bodies of water, having\r\n  need of seeing laterally, have, in fact, their eyes placed on the\r\n  sides of the head. Their bodies, more or less flattened according to\r\n  the _species_, have their sides perpendicular to the plane of the\r\n  water, and their eyes are placed in such a way that there is an eye\r\n  on each flattened side. But those fishes whose habits place them\r\n  under the necessity of constantly approaching the shores, and\r\n  especially the shelving banks or where the slope is slight, have\r\n  been forced to swim on their flattened faces, so as to be able to\r\n  approach nearer the edge of the water. In this situation, receiving\r\n  more light from above than from beneath, and having a special need\r\n  of being always attentive to what is going on above them, this need\r\n  has forced one of their eyes to undergo a kind of displacement, and\r\n  to assume the very singular situation which is familiar to us in the\r\n  _soles_, _turbots_, _dabs_, etc. (_Pleuronectes_ and _Achirus_). The\r\n  situation of these eyes is asymmetrical, because this results from\r\n  an incomplete change. Now, this change is entirely completed in the\r\n  rays, where the transverse flattening of the body is entirely\r\n  horizontal, as also the head. Also the eyes of the rays, both\r\n  situated on the upper side, have become symmetrical.\r\n\r\n  \"The serpents which glide along the surface of the ground are\r\n  obliged chiefly to see elevated objects, or what are above their\r\n  eyes. This necessity has brought an influence to bear on the\r\n  situation of the organs of vision in these animals; and, in fact,\r\n  they have the eyes placed in the lateral and upper parts of the\r\n  head, so as to easily perceive what is above or at their sides; but\r\n  they only see for a short distance what is in front of them.\r\n  Moreover, forced to supply the lack of ability to see and recognize\r\n  what is in front of their head, and which might injure them, they\r\n  need only to feel such objects with the aid of their tongue, which\r\n  they are obliged to dart out with all their power. This habit has\r\n  not only contributed to render the tongue slender, very long and\r\n  retractile, but has also led in a great number of species to its\r\n  division, so as to enable them to feel several objects at once; it\r\n  has likewise allowed them to form an opening at the end of their\r\n  head, to enable the tongue to dart out without their being obliged\r\n  to open their jaws.\r\n\r\n  \"Nothing is more remarkable than the result of habits in the\r\n  herbivorous mammals.\r\n\r\n  \"The quadruped to whom circumstances and the wants which they have\r\n  created have given for a long period, as also to others of its race,\r\n  the habit of browsing on grass, only walks on the ground, and is\r\n  obliged to rest there on its four feet the greater part of its life,\r\n  moving about very little, or only to a moderate extent. The\r\n  considerable time which this sort of creature is obliged to spend\r\n  each day to fill itself with the only kind of food which it\r\n  requires, leads it to move about very little, so that it uses its\r\n  legs only to stand on the ground, to walk, or run, and they never\r\n  serve to seize hold of or to climb trees.\r\n\r\n  \"From this habit of daily consuming great amounts of food which\r\n  distend the organs which receive it, and of only moving about to a\r\n  limited extent, it has resulted that the bodies of these animals are\r\n  thick, clumsy, and massive, and have acquired a very great volume,\r\n  as we see in elephants, rhinoceroses, oxen, buffaloes, horses, etc.\r\n\r\n  \"The habit of standing upright on their four feet during the greater\r\n  part of the day to browse has given origin to a thick hoof which\r\n  envelops the extremity of the digits of their feet; and as their\r\n  toes are not trained to make any movement, and because they have\r\n  served no other use than as supports, as also the rest of the leg,\r\n  the most of them are short, are reduced in size, and even have ended\r\n  by totally disappearing. Thus in the _pachyderms_, some have five\r\n  toes enveloped in horn, and consequently their foot is divided into\r\n  five parts; others have only four, and still others only three. But\r\n  in the _ruminants_, which seem to be the most ancient of mammals,\r\n  which are limited only to standing on the ground, there are only two\r\n  digits on each foot, and only a single one is to be found in the\r\n  _solipedes_ (the horse, the ass).\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, among these herbivorous animals, and especially among the\r\n  ruminants, it has been found that from the circumstances of the\r\n  desert countries they inhabit they are incessantly exposed to be\r\n  the prey of carnivorous animals, and find safety only in precipitous\r\n  flight. Necessity has forced them to run swiftly; and from the habit\r\n  they have thus acquired their body has become slenderer and their\r\n  limbs much more delicate: we see examples in the antelopes, the\r\n  gazelles, etc.\r\n\r\n  \"Other dangers in our climate to which are continually exposed the\r\n  deer, the roebuck, the fallow-deer, of perishing from the chase made\r\n  by man, have reduced them to the same necessity, restrained them to\r\n  similar habits, and have given rise to the same results.\r\n\r\n  \"The ruminating animals only using their legs as supports, and not\r\n  having strong jaws, which are only exercised in cutting and browsing\r\n  on grass, can only fight by striking with the head, by directing\r\n  against each other the _vertex_ of this part.\r\n\r\n  \"In their moments of anger, which are frequent, especially among the\r\n  males, their internal feelings, by their efforts, more strongly urge\r\n  the fluids toward this part of their head, and it there secretes the\r\n  corneous matter in some, and osseous matter mixed with corneous\r\n  matter in others, which gives origin to solid protuberances; hence\r\n  the origin of horns and antlers, with which most of these animals\r\n  have the head armed.\r\n\r\n  \"As regards habits, it is curious to observe the results in the\r\n  special form and height of the giraffe (_camelopardalis_); we know\r\n  that this animal, the tallest of mammals, inhabits the interior of\r\n  Africa, and that it lives in localities where the earth, almost\r\n  always arid and destitute of herbage, obliges it to browse on the\r\n  foliage of trees, and to make continual efforts to reach it. It has\r\n  resulted from this habit, maintained for a long period in all the\r\n  individuals of its race, that its forelegs have become longer than\r\n  the hinder ones, and that its neck is so elongated that the\r\n  giraffe, without standing on its hind legs, raises its head and\r\n  reaches six meters in height (almost twenty feet).\r\n\r\n  \"Among the birds, the ostriches, deprived of the power of flight,\r\n  and raised on very long legs, probably owe their singular\r\n  conformation to analogous circumstances.\r\n\r\n  \"The result of habits is as remarkable in the carnivorous mammals as\r\n  it is in the herbivorous, but it presents effects of another kind.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, those of these mammals which are habituated, as their race,\r\n  both to climb as well as to scratch or dig in the ground, or to tear\r\n  open and kill other animals for food, have been obliged to use the\r\n  digits of their feet; moreover, this habit has favored the\r\n  separation of their digits, and has formed the claws with which they\r\n  are armed.\r\n\r\n  \"But among the carnivores there are some which are obliged to run in\r\n  order to overtake their prey; moreover, since these need and\r\n  consequently have the habit of daily tearing with their claws and\r\n  burying them deeply in the body of another animal, to seize and then\r\n  to tear the flesh, and have been enabled by their repeated efforts\r\n  to procure for these claws a size and curvature which would greatly\r\n  interfere in walking or running on stony soil, it has resulted in\r\n  this case that the animal has been obliged to make other efforts to\r\n  draw back these too salient and curved claws which would impede it,\r\n  and hence there has resulted the gradual formation of those special\r\n  sheaths in which the cats, tigers, lions, etc., withdraw their claws\r\n  when not in action.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus the efforts in any direction whatever, maintained for a long\r\n  time or made habitually by certain parts of a living body to satisfy\r\n  necessities called out by nature or by circumstances, develop these\r\n  parts and make them acquire dimensions and a shape which they never\r\n  would have attained if these efforts had not become the habitual\r\n  action of the animals which have exercised them. The observations\r\n  made on all the animals known will everywhere furnish examples.\r\n\r\n  \"Can any of them be more striking than that which the _kangaroo_\r\n  offers us? This animal, which carries its young in its abdominal\r\n  pouch, has adopted the habit of holding itself erect, standing only\r\n  on its hind feet and tail, and only changing its position by a\r\n  series of leaps, in which it preserves its erect attitude so as not\r\n  to injure its young.\r\n\r\n  \"Let us see the result:\r\n\r\n  \"1. Its fore legs, of which it makes little use, and on which it\r\n  rests only during the instant when it leaves its erect attitude,\r\n  have never reached a development proportionate to that of the other\r\n  parts, and have remained thin, very small, and weak;\r\n\r\n  \"2. The hind legs, almost continually in action, both for supporting\r\n  the body and for leaping, have, on the contrary, obtained a\r\n  considerable development, and have become very large and strong;\r\n\r\n  \"3. Finally, the tail, which we see is of much use in supporting the\r\n  animal and in the performance of its principal movements, has\r\n  acquired at its base a thickness and a strength extremely\r\n  remarkable.\r\n\r\n  \"These well-known facts are assuredly well calculated to prove what\r\n  results from the habitual use in the animals of any organ or part;\r\n  and if, when there is observed in an animal an organ especially well\r\n  developed, strong, and powerful, it is supposed that its habitual\r\n  use has not produced it, that its continual disuse will make it lose\r\n  nothing, and, finally, that this organ has always been such since\r\n  the creation of the species to which this animal belongs, I will ask\r\n  why our domestic ducks cannot fly like wild ducks--in a word, I\r\n  might cite a multitude of examples which prove the differences in us\r\n  resulting from the exercise or lack of use of such of our organs,\r\n  although these differences might not be maintained in the\r\n  individuals which follow them genetically, for then their products\r\n  would be still more considerable.\r\n\r\n  \"I shall prove, in the second part, that when the will urges an\r\n  animal to any action, the organs which should execute this action\r\n  are immediately provoked by the affluence of subtile fluids (the\r\n  nervous fluid), which then become the determining cause which calls\r\n  for the action in question. A multitude of observations prove this\r\n  fact, which is now indisputable.\r\n\r\n  \"It results that the multiplied repetitions of these acts of\r\n  organization strengthen, extend, develop, and even create the organs\r\n  which are necessary. It is only necessary attentively to observe\r\n  that which is everywhere occurring to convince ourselves of the\r\n  well-grounded basis of this cause of organic developments and\r\n  changes.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, every change acquired in an organ by a habit of use\r\n  sufficient to have produced it is then preserved by heredity\r\n  (_génération_) if it is common to the individuals which, in\r\n  fecundation, unite in the reproduction of their species. Finally,\r\n  this change is propagated, and thus is transmitted to all the\r\n  individuals which succeed and which are submitted to the same\r\n  circumstances, unless they have been obliged to acquire it by the\r\n  means which have in reality created it.\r\n\r\n  \"Besides, in reproductive unions the crossings between the\r\n  individuals which have different qualities or forms are necessarily\r\n  opposed to the continuous propagation of these qualities and these\r\n  forms. We see that in man, who is exposed to so many diverse\r\n  circumstances which exert an influence on him, the qualities or the\r\n  accidental defects which he has been in the way of acquiring, are\r\n  thus prevented from being preserved and propagated by generation.\r\n  If, when some particular features of form or any defects are\r\n  acquired, two individuals under this condition should always pair,\r\n  they would reproduce the same features, and the successive\r\n  generations being confined to such unions, a special and distinct\r\n  race would then be formed. But perpetual unions between individuals\r\n  which do not have the same peculiarities of form would cause all the\r\n  characteristics acquired by special circumstances to disappear.\r\n\r\n  \"From this we can feel sure that if distances of habitation did not\r\n  separate men the intermixture by generation would cause the general\r\n  characteristics which distinguish the different nations to\r\n  disappear.\r\n\r\n  \"If I should choose to pass in review all the classes, all the\r\n  orders, all the genera, and all the species of animals which exist,\r\n  I should show that the structure of individuals and their parts,\r\n  their organs, their faculties, etc., etc., are in all cases the sole\r\n  result of the circumstances in which each species is found to be\r\n  subjected by nature and by the habits which the individuals which\r\n  compose it have been obliged to contract, and which are only the\r\n  product of a power primitively existing, which has forced the\r\n  animals into their well-known habits.\r\n\r\n  \"We know that the animal called the _ai_, or the sloth (_Bradypus\r\n  tridactylus_), is throughout life in a condition so very feeble that\r\n  it is very slow and limited in its movements, and that it walks on\r\n  the ground with much difficulty. Its movements are so slow that it\r\n  is thought that it cannot walk more than fifty steps in a day. It is\r\n  also known that the structure of this animal is in direct relation\r\n  with its feeble state or its inaptitude for walking; and that should\r\n  it desire to make any other movements than those which it is seen to\r\n  make, it could not do it.\r\n\r\n  \"Therefore, supposing that this animal had received from nature its\r\n  well-known organization, it is said that this organization has\r\n  forced it to adopt the habits and the miserable condition it is in.\r\n\r\n  \"I am far from thinking so; because I am convinced that the habits\r\n  which the individuals of the race of the _ai_ were originally\r\n  compelled to contract have necessarily brought their organization\r\n  into its actual state.\r\n\r\n  \"Since continual exposure to dangers has at some time compelled the\r\n  individuals of this species to take refuge in trees and to live in\r\n  them permanently, and then feed on their leaves, it is evident that\r\n  then they would give up making a multitude of movements that animals\r\n  which live on the ground perform.\r\n\r\n  \"All the needs of the _ai_ would then be reduced to seizing hold of\r\n  the branches, to creeping along them or to drawing them in so as to\r\n  reach the leaves, and then to remain on the tree in a kind of\r\n  inaction, so as to prevent falling. Besides, this kind of\r\n  sluggishness would be steadily provoked by the heat of the climate;\r\n  for in warm-blooded animals the heat urges them rather to repose\r\n  than to activity.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, during a long period of time the individuals of the race\r\n  of the _ai_ having preserved the habit of clinging to trees and of\r\n  making only slow and slightly varied movements, just sufficient for\r\n  their needs, their organization has gradually become adapted to\r\n  their new habits, and from this it will result:\r\n\r\n  \"1. That the arms of these animals making continual efforts readily\r\n  to embrace the branches of trees, would become elongated;\r\n\r\n  \"2. That the nails of their digits would acquire much length and a\r\n  hooked shape, by the continued efforts of the animal to retain its\r\n  hold;\r\n\r\n  \"3. That their digits never having been trained to make special\r\n  movements, would lose all mobility among themselves, would become\r\n  united, and would only preserve the power of bending or of\r\n  straightening out all together;\r\n\r\n  \"4. That their thighs, continually embracing both the trunks and the\r\n  larger branches of trees, would contract a condition of habitual\r\n  separation which would tend to widen the pelvis and to cause the\r\n  cotyloid cavities to be directed backward;\r\n\r\n  \"5. Finally, that a great number of their bones would become fused,\r\n  and hence several parts of their skeleton would assume an\r\n  arrangement and a figure conformed to the habits of these animals,\r\n  and contrary to what would be necessary for them to have for other\r\n  habits.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, this can never be denied, because, in fact, nature on a\r\n  thousand other occasions shows us, in the power exercised by\r\n  circumstances on habits, and in that of the influence of habits on\r\n  forms, dispositions, and the proportion of the parts of animals,\r\n  truly analogous facts.\r\n\r\n  \"A great number of citations being unnecessary, we now see to what\r\n  the case under discussion is reduced.\r\n\r\n  \"The fact is that divers animals have each, according to their genus\r\n  and their species, special habits, and in all cases an organization\r\n  which is perfectly adapted to these habits.\r\n\r\n  \"From the consideration of this fact, it appears that we should be\r\n  free to admit either one or the other of the following conclusions,\r\n  and that only one of them is susceptible of proof.\r\n\r\n  \"_Conclusion admitted up to this day_: Nature (or its Author), in\r\n  creating the animals, has foreseen all the possible kinds of\r\n  circumstances in which they should live, and has given to each\r\n  species an unchanging organization, as also a form determinate and\r\n  invariable in its different parts, which compels each species to\r\n  live in the places and in the climate where we find it, and has\r\n  there preserved its known habits.\r\n\r\n  \"_My own conclusion_: Nature, in producing in succession every\r\n  species of animal, and beginning with the least perfect or the\r\n  simplest to end her work with the most perfect, has gradually\r\n  complicated their structure; and these animals spreading generally\r\n  throughout all the inhabitable regions of the globe, each species\r\n  has received, through the influence of circumstances to which it has\r\n  been exposed, the habits which we have observed, and the\r\n  modifications in its organs which observation has shown us it\r\n  possesses.\r\n\r\n  \"The first of these two conclusions is that believed up to the\r\n  present day--namely, that held by nearly every one; it implies, in\r\n  each animal, an unchanging organization and parts which have never\r\n  varied, and which will never vary; it implies also that the\r\n  circumstances of the places which each species of animal inhabits\r\n  will never vary in these localities; for should they vary, the same\r\n  animals could not live there, and the possibility of discovering\r\n  similar forms elsewhere, and of transporting them there, would be\r\n  forbidden.\r\n\r\n  \"The second conclusion is my own: it implies that, owing to the\r\n  influence of circumstances on habits, and as the result of that of\r\n  habits on the condition of the parts and even on that of the\r\n  organization, each animal may receive in its parts and its\r\n  organization, modifications susceptible of becoming very\r\n  considerable, and of giving rise to the condition in which we find\r\n  all animals.\r\n\r\n  \"To maintain that this second conclusion is unfounded, it is\r\n  necessary at first to prove that each point of the surface of the\r\n  globe never varies in its nature, its aspect, its situation whether\r\n  elevated or depressed, its climate, etc., etc.; and likewise to\r\n  prove that any part of animals does not undergo, even at the end of\r\n  a long period, any modification by changes of circumstances, and by\r\n  the necessity which directs them to another kind of life and action\r\n  than that which is habitual to them.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, if a single fact shows that an animal for a long time\r\n  under domestication differs from the wild form from which it has\r\n  descended, and if in such a species in domesticity we find a great\r\n  difference in conformation between the individuals submitted to\r\n  such habits and those restricted to different habits, then it will\r\n  be certain that the first conclusion does not conform to the laws of\r\n  nature, and that, on the contrary, the second is perfectly in accord\r\n  with them.\r\n\r\n  \"Everything combines then to prove my assertion--namely, that it is\r\n  not the form, either of the body or of its parts, which gives rise\r\n  to habits, and to the mode of life among animals; but that it is on\r\n  the contrary the habits, the manner of living, and all the other\r\n  influencing circumstances which have, after a time, constituted the\r\n  form of the body and of the parts of animals. With the new forms,\r\n  new faculties have been acquired, and gradually nature has come to\r\n  form the animals as we actually see them.\r\n\r\n  \"Can there be in natural history a consideration more important, and\r\n  to which we should give more attention, than that which I have just\r\n  stated?\r\n\r\n  \"We will end this first part with the principles and the exposition\r\n  of the natural classification of animals.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fourth chapter of the third part (vol. ii. pp. 276-301) Lamarck\r\ntreats of the internal feelings of certain animals, which provoke wants\r\n(_besoins_). This is the subject which has elicited so much adverse\r\ncriticism and ridicule, and has in many cases led to the wholesale\r\nrejection of all of Lamarck's views. It is generally assumed or stated\r\nby Lamarck's critics, who evidently did not read his book carefully,\r\nthat while he claimed that the plants were evolved by the direct action\r\nof the physical factors, that in the case of all the animals the process\r\nwas indirect. But this is not correct. He evidently, as we shall see,\r\nplaces the lowest animals, those without (or what he supposed to be\r\nwithout) a nervous system, in the same category as the plants. He\r\ndistinctly states at the outset that only certain animals and man are\r\nendowed with this singular faculty, \"which consists in being able to\r\nexperience _internal emotions_ which provoke the wants and different\r\nexternal or internal causes, and which give birth to the power which\r\nenables them to perform different actions.\"\r\n\r\n\"The nervous fluid,\" he says, \"can, then, undergo movements in certain\r\nparts of its mass, as well as in every part at once; moreover, it is\r\nthese latter movements which constitute the _general movements_\r\n(_ébranlements_) of this fluid, and which we now proceed to consider.\r\n\r\n  \"The general movements of the nervous fluid are of two kinds;\r\n  namely,\r\n\r\n  \"1. Partial movements (_ébranlements_), which finally become general\r\n  and end in a reaction. It is the movements of this sort which\r\n  produce feeling. We have treated of them in the third chapter.\r\n\r\n  \"2. The movements which are general from the time they begin, and\r\n  which form no reaction. It is these which constitute internal\r\n  emotions, and it is of them alone of which we shall treat.\r\n\r\n  \"But previously, it is necessary to say a word regarding the\r\n  _feeling of existence_, because this feeling is the source from\r\n  which the inner emotions originate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_On the Feeling of Existence._\r\n\r\n  \"The feeling of existence (_sentiment d'existence_), which I shall\r\n  call _inner feeling_,[183] so as to separate from it the idea of a\r\n  general condition (_généralité_) which it does not possess, since it\r\n  is not common to all living beings and not even to all animals, is\r\n  a very obscure feeling, with which are endowed those animals\r\n  provided with a nervous system sufficiently developed to give them\r\n  the faculty of feeling.\r\n\r\n  \"This sentiment, very obscure as it is, is nevertheless very\r\n  powerful, for it is the source of inner emotions which test\r\n  (_éprouvent_) the individuals possessing it, and, as the result,\r\n  this singular force urges these individuals to themselves produce\r\n  the movements and the actions which their wants require. Moreover\r\n  this feeling, considered as a very active _motor_, only acts thus by\r\n  sending to the muscles which necessarily cause these movements and\r\n  actions the nervous fluid which excites them....\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, as the result of organic or vital movements which are\r\n  produced in every animal, that which possesses a nervous system\r\n  sufficiently developed has physical sensibility and continually\r\n  receives in every inner and sensitive part impressions which\r\n  continually affect it, and which it feels in general without being\r\n  able to distinguish any single one.\r\n\r\n  \"The sentiment of existence [consciousness] is general, since almost\r\n  every sensitive part of the body shares in it. 'It constitutes this\r\n  _me_ (_moi_) with which all animals, which are only sensitive, are\r\n  penetrated, without perceiving it, but which those possessing a\r\n  brain are able to notice, having the power of thought and of giving\r\n  attention to it. Finally, it is in all the source of a power which\r\n  is aroused by wants, which acts effectively only by emotion, and\r\n  through which the movements and actions derive the force which\r\n  produces them'....\r\n\r\n  \"Finally, the inner feeling only manifests its power, and causes\r\n  movements, when there exists a system for muscular movement, which\r\n  is always dependent on the nervous system, and cannot take place\r\n  without it.\"\r\n\r\nThe author then states that these emotions of the organic sense may\r\noperate in the animals and in man either without or with an act of their\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n  \"From what has been said, we cannot doubt but that the inner and\r\n  general feeling which urges the animals possessing a nervous system\r\n  fitted for feeling should be susceptible of being aroused by the\r\n  causes which affect it; moreover, these causes are always the need\r\n  both of satisfying hunger, of escaping dangers, of avoiding pain, of\r\n  seeking pleasure, or that which is agreeable to the individual, etc.\r\n\r\n  \"The emotions of the inner feeling can only be recognized by man,\r\n  who alone pays attention to them, but he only perceives those which\r\n  are strong, which excite his whole being, such as a view from a\r\n  precipice, a tragic scene, etc.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck then divides the emotions into physical and moral, the latter\r\narising from our ideas, thoughts--in short, our intellectual acts--in\r\nthe account of which we need not follow him.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding chapter (V.) the author dilates on the force which\r\ncauses actions in animals. \"We know,\" he says \"that plants can satisfy\r\ntheir needs without moving, since they find their food in the environing\r\n_milieux_. But it is not the same with animals, which are obliged to\r\nmove about to procure their sustenance. Moreover, most of them have\r\nother wants to satisfy, which require other kinds of movements and\r\nacts.\" This matter is discussed in the author's often leisurely and\r\nprolix way, with more or less repetition, which we will condense.\r\n\r\nThe lowest animals--those destitute of a nervous system--move in\r\nresponse to a stimulus from without. Nature has gradually created the\r\ndifferent organs of animals, varying the structure and situation of\r\nthese organs according to circumstances, and has progressively improved\r\ntheir powers. She has begun by borrowing from without, so to speak--from\r\nthe environment--the _productive force_, both of organic movements and\r\nthose of the external parts. \"She has thus transported this force [the\r\nresult of heat, electricity, and perhaps others (p. 307)] into the\r\nanimal itself, and, finally, in the most perfect animals she has placed\r\na great part of this force at their disposal, as I will soon show.\"\r\n\r\nThis force incessantly introduced into the lowest animals sets in motion\r\nthe visible fluids of the body and excites the irritability of their\r\ncontained parts, giving rise to different contractile movements which we\r\nobserve; hence the appearance of an irresistible propensity (_penchant_)\r\nwhich constrains them to execute those movements which by their\r\ncontinuity or their repetition give rise to habits.\r\n\r\nThe most imperfect animals, such as the _Infusoria_, especially the\r\nmonads, are nourished by absorption and by \"an internal inhibition of\r\nabsorbed matters.\" \"They have,\" he says, \"no power of seeking their\r\nfood, they have not even the power of recognizing it, but they absorb it\r\nbecause it comes in contact with every side of them (_avec tous les\r\npoints de leur individu_), and because the water in which they live\r\nfurnishes it to them in sufficient abundance.\"\r\n\r\n\"These frail animals, in which the subtile fluids of the environing\r\n_milieux_ constitute the stimulating cause of the orgasm, of\r\nirritability and of organic movements, execute, as I have said,\r\ncontractile movements which, provoked and varied without ceasing by this\r\nstimulating cause, facilitate and hasten the absorptions of which I have\r\njust spoken.\" ...\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Transportation of the force-producing Movements in the Interior\r\nof Animals._\r\n\r\n  \"If nature were confined to the employment of its first\r\n  means--namely, of a force entirely external and foreign to the\r\n  animal--its work would have remained very important; the animals\r\n  would have remained machines totally passive, and she would never\r\n  have given origin in any of these living beings to the admirable\r\n  phenomena of sensibility, of inmost feelings of existence which\r\n  result therefrom, of the power of action, finally, of ideas, by\r\n  which she can create the most wonderful of all, that of thought--in\r\n  a word, intelligence.\r\n\r\n  \"But, wishing to attain these grand results, she has by slow degrees\r\n  prepared the means, in gradually giving consistence to the internal\r\n  parts of animals; in differentiating the organs, and in multiplying\r\n  and farther forming the fluids contained, etc., after which she has\r\n  transported into the interior of these animals that force productive\r\n  of movements and of actions which in truth it would not dominate at\r\n  first, but which she has come to place, in great part, at their\r\n  disposition when their organization should become very much more\r\n  perfect.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, from the time that the animal organization had sufficiently\r\n  advanced in its structure to possess a nervous system--even slightly\r\n  developed, as in insects--the animals provided with this\r\n  organization were endowed with an intimate sense of their existence,\r\n  and from that time the force productive of movements was conveyed\r\n  into the very interior of the animal.\r\n\r\n  \"I have already made it evident that this internal force which\r\n  produces movements and actions should derive its origin in the\r\n  intimate feeling of existence which animals with a nervous system\r\n  possess, and that this feeling, solicited or aroused by needs,\r\n  should then start into motion the subtile fluid contained in the\r\n  nerves and carry it to the muscles which should act, this producing\r\n  the actions which the needs require.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, every want felt produces an emotion in the inner feeling\r\n  of the individual which experiences it; and from this emotion of the\r\n  feeling in question arises the force which gives origin to the\r\n  movement of the parts which are placed in activity....\r\n\r\n  \"Thus, in the animals which possess the power of acting--namely, the\r\n  force productive of movements and actions--the inner feeling, which\r\n  on each occasion originates this force, being excited by some need,\r\n  places in action the power or force in question; excites the\r\n  movement of displacement in the subtile fluid of the nerves--which\r\n  the ancients called _animal spirits_; directs this fluid towards\r\n  that of its organs which any want impels to action; finally makes\r\n  this same fluid flow back into its habitual reservoirs when the\r\n  needs no longer require the organ to act.\r\n\r\n  \"The inner feeling takes the place of the _will_; for it is now\r\n  important to consider that every animal which does not possess the\r\n  special organ in which or by which it executes thoughts, judgments,\r\n  etc., has in reality no will, does not make a choice, and\r\n  consequently cannot control the movements which its inner feeling\r\n  excites. _Instinct_ directs these actions, and we shall see that\r\n  this direction always results from emotions of the inner feeling, in\r\n  which intelligence has no part, and from the organization even which\r\n  the habits have modified, in such a manner that the needs of animals\r\n  which are in this category, being necessarily limited and always\r\n  the same in the same species, the inner feeling and, consequently,\r\n  the power of acting, always produces the same actions.\r\n\r\n  \"It is not the same in animals which besides a nervous system have a\r\n  brain [the author meaning the higher vertebrates], and which make\r\n  comparisons, judgments, thoughts, etc. These same animals control\r\n  more or less their power of action according to the degree of\r\n  perfection of their brain; and although they are still strongly\r\n  subjected to the results of their habits, which have modified their\r\n  structure, they enjoy more or less freedom of the will, can choose,\r\n  and can vary their acts, or at least some of them.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck then treats of the consumption and exhaustion of the nervous\r\nfluid in the production of animal movements, resulting in fatigue.\r\n\r\nHe next occupies himself with the origin of the inclination to the same\r\nactions, and of instinct in animals.\r\n\r\n  \"The cause of the well-known phenomenon which constrains almost all\r\n  animals to always perform the same acts, and that which gives rise\r\n  in man to a propensity (_penchant_) to repeat every action, becoming\r\n  habitual, assuredly merits investigation.\r\n\r\n  \"The animals which are only 'sensible'[184]--namely, which possess\r\n  no brain, cannot think, reason, or perform intelligent acts, and\r\n  their perceptions being often very confused--do not reason and can\r\n  scarcely vary their actions. They are, then, invariably bound by\r\n  habits. Thus the insects, which of all animals endowed with feeling\r\n  have the least perfect nervous system,[185] have perceptions of\r\n  objects which affect them, and seem to have memory of them when they\r\n  are repeated. Yet they can vary their actions and change their\r\n  habits, though they do not possess the organ whose acts could give\r\n  them the means.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_On the Instincts of Animals._\r\n\r\n  \"We define instinct as the sum (_ensemble_) of the decisions\r\n  (_déterminations_) of animals in their actions; and, indeed, some\r\n  have thought that these determinations were the product of a\r\n  rational choice, and consequently the fruit of experience. Others,\r\n  says Cabanis, may think with the observers of all ages that several\r\n  of these decisions should not be ascribed to any kind of reasoning,\r\n  and that, without ceasing as for that to have their source in\r\n  physical sensibility, they are most often formed without the will of\r\n  the individuals able to have any other part than in better directing\r\n  the execution. It should be added, without the will having any part\r\n  in it; for when it does not act, it does not, of course, direct the\r\n  execution.\r\n\r\n  \"If it had been considered that all the animals which enjoy the\r\n  power of sensation have their inner feeling susceptible of being\r\n  aroused by their needs, and that the movements of their nervous\r\n  fluids, which result from these emotions, are constantly directed by\r\n  this inner sentiment and by habits, then it has been felt that in\r\n  all the animals deprived of intelligence all the decisions of action\r\n  can never be the result of a rational choice, of judgment, of\r\n  profitable experience--in a word, of will--but that they are\r\n  subjected to needs which certain sensations excite, and which awaken\r\n  the inclinations which urge them on.\r\n\r\n  \"In the animals even which enjoy the power of performing certain\r\n  intelligent acts, it is still more often the inner feeling and the\r\n  inclinations originating from habits which decide, without choice,\r\n  the acts which animals perform.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, although the executing power of movements and of actions,\r\n  as also the cause which directs them, should be entirely internal,\r\n  it is not well, as has been done,[186] to limit to internal\r\n  impressions the primary cause or provocation of these acts, with the\r\n  intention to restrict to external impressions that which provokes\r\n  intelligent acts; for, from what few facts are known bearing on\r\n  these considerations, we are convinced that, either way, the causes\r\n  which arouse and provoke acts are sometimes internal and sometimes\r\n  external, that these same causes give rise in reality to impressions\r\n  all of which act internally.\r\n\r\n  \"According to the idea generally attached to the word _instinct_ the\r\n  faculty which this word expresses is considered as a light which\r\n  illuminates and guides animals in their actions, and which is with\r\n  them what reason is to us. No one has shown that instinct can be a\r\n  force which calls into action; that this force acts effectively\r\n  without any participation of the will, and that it is constantly\r\n  directed by acquired inclinations.\"\r\n\r\nThere are, the author states, two kinds of causes which can arouse the\r\ninner feeling (organic sense)--namely, those which depend on\r\nintellectual acts, and those which, without arising from it, immediately\r\nexcite it and force it to direct its power of acting in the direction of\r\nacquired inclinations.\r\n\r\n  \"These are the only causes of this last kind, which constitute all\r\n  the acts of _instinct_; and as these acts are not the result of\r\n  deliberation, of choice, of judgment, the actions which arise from\r\n  them always satisfy, surely and without error, the wants felt and\r\n  the propensities arising from habits.\r\n\r\n  \"Hence, _instinct_ in animals is an inclination which necessitates\r\n  that from sensations provoked while giving rise to wants the animal\r\n  is impelled to act without the participation of any thought or any\r\n  act of the will.\r\n\r\n  \"This propensity owes to the organization what the habits have\r\n  modified in its favor, and it is excited by impressions and wants\r\n  which arouse the organic sense of the individual and put it in the\r\n  way of sending the nervous fluid in the direction which the\r\n  propensity in activity needs to the muscles to be placed in action.\r\n\r\n  \"I have already said that the habit of exercising such an organ, or\r\n  such a part of the body, to satisfy the needs which often spring up,\r\n  should give to the subtile fluid which changes its place where is to\r\n  be operated the power which causes action so great a facility in\r\n  moving towards this organ, where it has been so often employed, that\r\n  this habit should in a way become inherent in the nature of the\r\n  individual, which is unable to change it.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, the wants of animals possessing a nervous system being,\r\n  in each case, dependent on the Structure of these organisms, are:\r\n\r\n  \"1. Of obtaining any kind of food;\r\n\r\n  \"2. Of yielding to sexual fecundation which excites in them certain\r\n  sensations;\r\n\r\n  \"3. Of avoiding pain;\r\n\r\n  \"4. Of seeking pleasure or happiness.\r\n\r\n  \"To satisfy these wants they contract different kinds of habits,\r\n  which are transformed into so many propensities, which they can\r\n  neither resist nor change. From this originate their habitual\r\n  actions, and their special propensities to which we give the name\r\n  of instinct.[187]\r\n\r\n  \"This propensity of animals to preserve their habits and to renew\r\n  the actions resulting from them being once acquired, is then\r\n  propagated by means of reproduction or generation, which preserves\r\n  the organization and the disposition of parts in the state thus\r\n  attained, so that this same propensity already exists in the new\r\n  individuals even before they have exercised it.\r\n\r\n  \"It is thus that the same habits and the same _instinct_ are\r\n  perpetuated from generation to generation in the different species\r\n  or races of animals, without offering any notable variation,[188] so\r\n  long as it does not suffer change in the circumstances essential to\r\n  the mode of life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_On the Industry of Certain Animals._\r\n\r\n  \"In those animals which have no brain that which we call _industry_\r\n  as applied to certain of their actions does not deserve such a name,\r\n  for it is a mistake to attribute to them a faculty which they do not\r\n  possess.\r\n\r\n  \"Propensities transmitted and received by heredity (_génération_);\r\n  habits of performing complicated actions, and which result from\r\n  these acquired propensities; finally, different difficulties\r\n  gradually and habitually overcome by as many emotions of the organic\r\n  sense (_sentiment intérieur_), constitute the sum of actions which\r\n  are always the same in the individuals of the same race, to which we\r\n  inconsiderately give the name of _industry_.\r\n\r\n  \"The instinct of animals being formed by the habit of satisfying the\r\n  four kinds of wants mentioned above, and resulting from the\r\n  propensities acquired for a long time which urge them on in a way\r\n  determined for each species, there comes to pass, in the case of\r\n  some, only a complication in the actions which can satisfy these\r\n  four kinds of wants, or certain of them, and, indeed, only the\r\n  different difficulties necessary to be overcome have gradually\r\n  compelled the animal to extend and make contrivances, and have led\r\n  it, without choice or any intellectual act, but only by the emotions\r\n  of the organic sense, to perform such and such acts.\r\n\r\n  \"Hence the origin, in certain animals, of different complicated\r\n  actions, which has been called _industry_, and which are so\r\n  enthusiastically admired, because it has always been supposed, at\r\n  least tacitly, that these actions were contrived and deliberately\r\n  planned, which is plainly erroneous. They are evidently the fruit of\r\n  a necessity which has expanded and directed the habits of the\r\n  animals performing them, and which renders them such as we observe.\r\n\r\n  \"What I have just said is especially applicable to the invertebrate\r\n  animals, in which there enters no act of intelligence. None of\r\n  these can indeed freely vary its actions; none of them has the power\r\n  of abandoning what we call its _industry_ to adopt any other kind.\r\n\r\n  \"There is, then, nothing wonderful in the supposed industry of the\r\n  ant-lion (_Myrmeleon formica-leo_), which, having thrown up a\r\n  hillock of movable sand, waits until its booty is thrown down to the\r\n  bottom of its funnel by the showers of sand to become its victim;\r\n  also there is none in the manoeuvre of the oyster, which, to\r\n  satisfy all its wants, does nothing but open and close its shell. So\r\n  long as their organization is not changed they will always, both of\r\n  them, do what we see them do, and they will do it neither\r\n  voluntarily nor rationally.\r\n\r\n  \"This is not the case with the vertebrate animals, and it is among\r\n  them, especially in the birds and mammals, that we observe in their\r\n  actions traces of a true _industry_; because in difficult cases\r\n  their intelligence, in spite of their propensity to habits, can aid\r\n  them in varying their actions. These acts, however, are not common,\r\n  and are only slightly manifested in certain races which have\r\n  exercised them more, as we have had frequent occasion to remark.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck then (chapter vi.) examines into the nature of the _will_, which\r\nhe says is really the principle underlying all the actions of animals.\r\nThe will, he says, is one of the results of thought, the result of a\r\nreflux of a portion of the nervous fluid towards the parts which are to\r\nact.\r\n\r\nHe compares the brain to a register on which are imprinted ideas of all\r\nkinds acquired by the individual, so that this individual provokes at\r\nwill an effusion of the nervous fluid on this register, and directs it\r\nto any particular page. The remainder of the second volume\r\n(chapter vii.) is devoted to the understanding, its origin and that of\r\nideas. The following additions relative to chapters vii. and viii. of\r\nthe first part of this work are from vol. ii., pp. 451-466.\r\n\r\nIn the last of June, 1809, the menagerie of the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory having received a Phoca (_Phoca vitulina_), Lamarck, as he says,\r\nhad the opportunity of observing its movements and habits. After\r\ndescribing its habits in swimming and moving on land and observing its\r\nrelation to the clawed mammals, he says his main object is to remark\r\nthat the seals do not have the hind legs arranged in the same direction\r\nas the axis of their body, because these animals are constrained to\r\nhabitually use them to form a caudal fin, closing and widening, by\r\nspreading their digits, the paddle (_palette_) which results from their\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n  \"The morses, on the contrary, which are accustomed to feed on grass\r\n  near the shore, never use their hind feet as a caudal fin; but their\r\n  feet are united together with the tail, and cannot separate. Thus in\r\n  animals of similar origin we see a new proof of the effect of habits\r\n  on the form and structure of organs.\"\r\n\r\nHe then turns to the flying mammals, such as the flying squirrel\r\n(_Sciurus volans_, _ærobates_, _petaurista_, _sagitta_, and\r\n_volucella_), and then explains the origin of their adaptation for\r\nflying leaps.\r\n\r\n  \"These animals, more modern than the seals, having the habit of\r\n  extending their limbs while leaping to form a sort of _parachute_,\r\n  can _only_ make a very prolonged leap when they glide down from a\r\n  tree or spring only a short distance from one tree to another. Now,\r\n  by frequent repetitions of such leaps, in the individuals of these\r\n  races the skin of their sides is expanded on each side into a loose\r\n  membrane, which connects the hind and fore legs, and which,\r\n  enclosing a volume of air, prevents their sudden falling. These\r\n  animals are, moreover, without membranes between the fingers and\r\n  toes.\r\n\r\n  \"The Galeopithecus (_Lemur volans_), undoubtedly a more ancient form\r\n  but with the same habits as the flying squirrel (_Pteromys Geoff._),\r\n  has the skin of the _flancs_ more ample, still more developed,\r\n  connecting not only the hinder with the fore legs, but in addition\r\n  the fingers and the tail with the hind feet. Moreover, they leap\r\n  much farther than the flying squirrels, and even make a sort of\r\n  flight.[189]\r\n\r\n  \"Finally, the different bats are probably mammals still older than\r\n  the Galeopithecus, in the habit of extending their membrane and even\r\n  their fingers to encompass a greater volume of air, so as to sustain\r\n  their bodies when they fly out into the air.\r\n\r\n  \"By these habits, for so long a period contracted and preserved, the\r\n  bats have obtained not only lateral membranes, but also an\r\n  extraordinary elongation of the fingers of their fore feet (with the\r\n  exception of the thumb), between which are these very ample\r\n  membranes uniting them; so that these membranes of the hands become\r\n  continuous with those of the flanks, and with those which connect\r\n  the tail with the two hind feet, forming in these animals great\r\n  membranous wings with which they fly perfectly, as everybody knows.\r\n\r\n  \"Such is then the power of habits, which have a singular influence\r\n  on the conformation of parts, and which give to the animals which\r\n  have for a long time contracted certain of them, faculties not found\r\n  in other animals.\r\n\r\n  \"As regards the amphibious animals of which I have often spoken, it\r\n  gives me pleasure to communicate to my readers the following\r\n  reflections which have arisen from an examination of all the objects\r\n  which I have taken into consideration in my studies, and seen more\r\n  and more to be confirmed.\r\n\r\n  \"I do not doubt but that the mammals have in reality originated from\r\n  them, and that they are the veritable cradle (_berceau_) of the\r\n  entire animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, we see that the least perfect animals (and they are the\r\n  most numerous) live only in the water; hence it is probable, as I\r\n  have said (vol. ii., p. 85), that it is only in the water or in very\r\n  humid places that nature causes and still forms, under favorable\r\n  conditions, direct or spontaneous generations which have produced\r\n  the simplest animalcules and those from which have successively been\r\n  derived all the other animals.\r\n\r\n  \"We know that the Infusoria, the polyps, and the Radiata only live\r\n  in the water; that the worms even only live some in the water and\r\n  others in very damp places.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, regarding the worms, which seem to form an initial branch\r\n  of the animal scale, since it is evident that the Infusoria form\r\n  another branch, we may suppose that among those of them which are\r\n  wholly aquatic--namely, which do not live in the bodies of other\r\n  animals, such as the Gordius and many others still unknown--there\r\n  are doubtless a great many different aquatic forms; and that among\r\n  these aquatic worms, those which afterwards habitually expose\r\n  themselves to the air have probably produced amphibious insects,\r\n  such as the mosquitoes, the ephemeras, etc., etc., which have\r\n  successively given origin to all the insects which live solely in\r\n  the air. But several races of these having changed their habits by\r\n  the force of circumstances, and having formed habits of a life\r\n  solitary, retired, or hidden, have given rise to the arachnides,\r\n  almost all of which also live in the air.\r\n\r\n  \"Finally, those of the arachnides which have frequented the water,\r\n  which have consequently become progressively habituated to live in\r\n  it, and which finally cease to expose themselves to the air--this\r\n  indicates the relations which, connecting the Scolopendræ to Julus,\r\n  this to the Oniscus, and the last to Asellus, shrimps, etc., have\r\n  caused the existence of all the Crustacea.\r\n\r\n  \"The other aquatic worms which are never exposed to the air,\r\n  multiplying and diversifying their races with time, and gradually\r\n  making progress in the complication of their structure, have caused\r\n  the formation of the Annelida, Cirripedia, and molluscs, which\r\n  together form an uninterrupted portion of the animal scale.\r\n\r\n  \"In spite of the considerable hiatus which we observe between the\r\n  known molluscs and the fishes, the molluscs, whose origin I have\r\n  just indicated, have, by the intermediation of those yet remaining\r\n  unknown, given origin to the fishes, as it is evident that the\r\n  latter have given rise to the reptiles.\r\n\r\n  \"In continuing to consult the probabilities on the origin of\r\n  different animals, we cannot doubt but that the reptiles, by two\r\n  distinct branches which circumstances have brought about, have given\r\n  rise on one side to the formation of birds, and on the other to\r\n  that of amphibious mammals, which have given in their turn origin to\r\n  all the other mammals.[190]\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, the fishes having caused the formation of Batrachia, and\r\n  these of the Ophidian reptiles, both having only one auricle in the\r\n  heart, nature has easily come to give a heart with a double auricle\r\n  to other reptiles which constitute two special branches; finally,\r\n  she has easily arrived at the end of forming, in the animals which\r\n  had originated from each of these branches, a heart with two\r\n  ventricles.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus, among the reptiles whose heart has a double auricle, on the\r\n  one side, the Chelonians seem to have given origin to the birds; if,\r\n  independently of several relations which we cannot disregard, I\r\n  should place the head of a tortoise on the neck of certain birds, I\r\n  should perceive almost no disparity in the general physiognomy of\r\n  the factitious animal; and on the other side, the saurians,\r\n  especially the 'planicaudes,' such as the crocodiles, seem to have\r\n  given origin to the amphibious mammals.\r\n\r\n  \"If the branch of the Chelonians has given rise to birds, we can yet\r\n  presume that the palmipede aquatic birds, especially the\r\n  _brevipennes_, such as the penguins and the _manchots_, have given\r\n  origin to the monotremes.\r\n\r\n  \"Finally, if the branch of saurians has given rise to the amphibious\r\n  mammals, it will be most probable that this branch is the source\r\n  whence all the mammals have taken their origin.\r\n\r\n  \"I therefore believe myself authorized to think that the terrestrial\r\n  mammals originally descended from those aquatic mammals that we call\r\n  Amphibia. Because the latter being divided into three branches by\r\n  the diversity of the habits which, with the lapse of time, they have\r\n  adopted, some have caused the formation of the Cetacea, others that\r\n  of the ungulated mammals, and still others that of the unguiculate\r\n  mammals.\r\n\r\n  \"For example, those of the Amphibia which have preserved the habit\r\n  of frequenting the shores differ in the manner of taking their food.\r\n  Some among them accustoming themselves to browse on herbage, such as\r\n  the morses and lamatines, gradually gave origin to the ungulate\r\n  mammals, such as the pachyderms, ruminants, etc.; the others, such\r\n  as the Phocidæ, contracting the habit of feeding on fishes and\r\n  marine animals, caused the existence of the unguiculate mammals, by\r\n  means of races which, while becoming differentiated, became entirely\r\n  terrestrial.\r\n\r\n  \"But those aquatic mammals which would form the habit of never\r\n  leaving the water, and only rising to breathe at the surface, would\r\n  probably give origin to the different known cetaceans. Moreover, the\r\n  ancient and complete habitation of the Cetacea in the ocean has so\r\n  modified their structure that it is now very difficult to recognize\r\n  the source whence they have derived their origin.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, since the enormous length of time during which these\r\n  animals have lived in the depths of the sea, never using their hind\r\n  feet in seizing objects, their disused feet have wholly disappeared,\r\n  as also their skeleton, and even the pelvis serving as their\r\n  attachment.\r\n\r\n  \"The alteration which the cetaceans have undergone in their limbs,\r\n  owing to the influence of the medium in which they live and the\r\n  habits which they have there contracted, manifests itself also in\r\n  their fore limbs, which, entirely enveloped by the skin, no longer\r\n  show externally the fingers in which they end; so that they only\r\n  offer on each side a fin which contains concealed within it the\r\n  skeleton of a hand.\r\n\r\n  \"Assuredly, the cetaceans being mammals, it entered into the plan of\r\n  their structure to have four limbs like the others, and\r\n  consequently a pelvis to sustain their hind legs. But here, as\r\n  elsewhere, that which is lacking in them is the result of atrophy\r\n  brought about, at the end of a long time, by the want of use of the\r\n  parts which were useless.\r\n\r\n  \"If we consider that in the Phocæ, where the pelvis still exists,\r\n  this pelvis is impoverished, narrowed, and with no projections on\r\n  the hips, we see that the lessened (_médiocre_) use of the hind feet\r\n  of these animals must be the cause, and that if this use should\r\n  entirely cease, the hind limbs and even the pelvis would in the end\r\n  disappear.\r\n\r\n  \"The considerations which I have just presented may doubtless appear\r\n  as simple conjectures, because it is possible to establish them only\r\n  on direct and positive proofs. But if we pay any attention to the\r\n  observations which I have stated in this work, and if then we\r\n  examine carefully the animals which I have mentioned, as also the\r\n  result of their habits and their surroundings, we shall find that\r\n  these conjectures will acquire, after this examination, an eminent\r\n  probability.\r\n\r\n  \"The following _tableau_[191] will facilitate the comprehension of\r\n  what I have just stated. It will be seen that, in my opinion, the\r\n  animal scale begins at least by two special branches, and that in\r\n  the course of its extent some branchlets (_rameaux_) would seem to\r\n  terminate in certain places.\r\n\r\n  \"This series of animals beginning with two branches where are\r\n  situated the most imperfect, the first of these branches received\r\n  their existence only by direct or spontaneous generation.\r\n\r\n  \"A strong reason prevents our knowing the changes successively\r\n  brought about which have produced the condition in which we observe\r\n  them; it is because we are never witnesses of these changes. Thus we\r\n  see the work when done, but never watching them during the process,\r\n  we are naturally led to believe that things have always been as we\r\n  see them, and not as they have progressively been brought about.\r\n\r\n  \"Among the changes which nature everywhere incessantly produces in\r\n  her _ensemble_, and her laws remain always the same, such of these\r\n  changes as, to bring about, do not need much more time than the\r\n  duration of human life, are easily understood by the man who\r\n  observes them; but he cannot perceive those which are accomplished\r\n  at the end of a considerable time.\r\n\r\n  \"If the duration of human life only extended to the length of a\r\n  _second_, and if there existed one of our actual clocks mounted and\r\n  in movement, each individual of our species who should look at the\r\n  hour-hand of this clock would never see it change its place in the\r\n  course of his life, although this hand would really not be\r\n  stationary. The observations of thirty generations would never learn\r\n  anything very evident as to the displacement of this hand, because\r\n  its movement, only being that made during half a minute, would be\r\n  too slight to make an impression; and if observations much more\r\n  ancient should show that this same hand had really moved, those who\r\n  should see the statement would not believe it, and would suppose\r\n  there was some error, each one having always seen the hand on the\r\n  same point of the dial-plate.\r\n\r\n  \"I leave to my readers all the applications to be made regarding\r\n  this supposition.\r\n\r\n  \"_Nature_, that immense totality of different beings and bodies, in\r\n  every part of which exists an eternal circle of movements and\r\n  changes regulated by law; totality alone unchangeable, so long as it\r\n  pleases its SUBLIME AUTHOR to make it exist, should be regarded as a\r\n  whole constituted by its parts, for a purpose which its Author alone\r\n  knows, and not exclusively for any one of them.\r\n\r\n  \"Each part necessarily is obliged to change, and to cease to be one\r\n  in order to constitute another, with interests opposed to those of\r\n  all; and if it has the power of reasoning it finds this whole\r\n  imperfect. In reality, however, this whole is perfect, and\r\n  completely fulfils the end for which it was designed.\"\r\n\r\nThe last work in which Lamarck discussed the theory of descent was in\r\nhis introduction to the _Animaux sans Vertèbres_. But here the only\r\nchanges of importance are his four laws, which we translate, and a\r\nsomewhat different phylogeny of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe four laws differ from the two given in the _Philosophie zoologique_\r\nin his theory (the second law) accounting for the origin of a new organ,\r\nthe result of a new need.\r\n\r\n  \"_First law_: Life, by its proper forces, continually tends to\r\n  increase the volume of every body which possesses it, and to\r\n  increase the size of its parts, up to a limit which it brings about.\r\n\r\n  \"_Second law_: The production of a new organ in an animal body\r\n  results from the supervention of a new want (_besoin_) which\r\n  continues to make itself felt, and of a new movement which this want\r\n  gives rise to and maintains.\r\n\r\n  \"_Third law_: The development of organs and their power of action\r\n  are constantly in ratio to the employment of these organs.\r\n\r\n  \"_Fourth law_: Everything which has been acquired, impressed upon,\r\n  or changed in the organization of individuals, during the course of\r\n  their life is preserved by generation and transmitted to the new\r\n  individuals which have descended from those which have undergone\r\n  those changes.\"\r\n\r\nIn explaining the second law he says:\r\n\r\n  \"The foundation of this law derives its proof from the third, in\r\n  which the facts known allow of no doubt; for, if the forces of\r\n  action of an organ, by their increase, further develop this\r\n  organ--namely, increase its size and power, as is constantly proved\r\n  by facts--we may be assured that the forces by which it acts, just\r\n  originated by a new want felt, would necessarily give birth to the\r\n  organ adapted to satisfy this new want, if this organ had not before\r\n  existed.\r\n\r\n  \"In truth, in animals so low as not to be able to _feel_, it cannot\r\n  be that we should attribute to a felt want the formation of a new\r\n  organ, this formation being in such a case the product of a\r\n  mechanical cause, as that of a new movement produced in a part of\r\n  the fluids of the animal.\r\n\r\n  \"It is not the same in animals with a more complicated structure,\r\n  and which are able to _feel_. They feel wants, and each want felt,\r\n  exciting their inner feeling, forthwith sets the fluids in motion\r\n  and forces them towards the point of the body where an action may\r\n  satisfy the want experienced. Now, if there exists at this point an\r\n  organ suitable for this action, it is immediately cited to act; and\r\n  if the organ does not exist, and only the felt want be for instance\r\n  pressing and continuous, gradually the organ originates, and is\r\n  developed on account of the continuity and energy of its employment.\r\n\r\n  \"If I had not been convinced: 1, that the thought alone of an action\r\n  which strongly interests it suffices to arouse the _inner feeling_\r\n  of an individual; 2, that a felt want can itself arouse the feeling\r\n  in question; 3, that every emotion of _inner feeling_, resulting\r\n  from a want which is aroused, directs at the same instant a mass of\r\n  nervous fluid to the points to be set in activity, that it also\r\n  creates a flow thither of the fluids of the body, and especially\r\n  nutrient ones; that, finally, it then places in activity the organs\r\n  already existing, or makes efforts for the formation of those which\r\n  would not have existed there, and which a continual want would\r\n  therefore render necessary--I should have had doubts as to the\r\n  reality of the law which I have just indicated.\r\n\r\n  \"But, although it may be very difficult to verify this law by\r\n  observation, I have no doubt as to the grounds on which I base it,\r\n  the necessity of its existence being involved in that of the third\r\n  law, which is now well established.\r\n\r\n  \"I conceive, for example, that a _gasteropod mollusc_, which, as it\r\n  crawls along, finds the need of feeling the bodies in front of it,\r\n  makes efforts to touch those bodies with some of the foremost parts\r\n  of its head, and sends to these every time supplies of nervous\r\n  fluids, as well as other fluids--I conceive, I say, that it must\r\n  result from this reiterated afflux towards the points in question\r\n  that the nerves which abut at these points will, by slow degrees, be\r\n  extended. Now, as in the same circumstances other fluids of the\r\n  animal flow also to the same places, and especially nourishing\r\n  fluids, it must follow that two or more tentacles will appear and\r\n  develop insensibly under those circumstances on the points referred\r\n  to.\r\n\r\n  \"This is doubtless what has happened to all the races of\r\n  _Gasteropods_, whose wants have compelled them to adopt the habit of\r\n  feeling bodies with some part of their head.\r\n\r\n  \"But if there occur, among the _Gasteropods_, any races which, by\r\n  the circumstances which concern their mode of existence or life, do\r\n  not experience such wants, then their head remains without\r\n  tentacles; it has even no projection, no traces of tentacles, and\r\n  this is what has happened in the case of _Bullæa_, _Bulla_, and\r\n  _Chiton_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Supplément à la Distribution générale des Animaux_\r\n(Introduction, p. 342), concerning the real order of origin of the\r\ninvertebrate classes, Lamarck proposes a new genealogical tree. He\r\nstates that the order of the animal series \"is far from simple, that it\r\nis branching, and seems even to be composed of several distinct series;\"\r\nthough farther on (p. 456) he adds:\r\n\r\n  \"Je regarde _l'ordre de la production_ des animaux comme formé de\r\n  deux séries distinctes.\r\n\r\n  \"Ainsi, je soumets à la méditation des zoologistes l'ordre présumé\r\n  de la _formation_ des animaux, tel que l'exprime le tableau\r\n  suivant:\"\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the origin of instinct, as in evolution in general,\r\nLamarck appears to have laid the foundation on which Darwin's views,\r\nthough he throws aside Lamarck's factors, must rest. The \"inherited\r\nhabit\" theory is thus stated by Lamarck.\r\n\r\nInstinct, he claims, is not common to all animals, since the lowest\r\nforms, like plants, are entirely passive under the influences of the\r\nsurrounding medium; they have no wants, are automata.\r\n\r\n  \"But animals with a nervous system have _wants_, _i.e._, they feel\r\n  hunger, sexual desires, they desire to avoid pain or to seek\r\n  pleasure, etc. To satisfy these wants they contract habits, which\r\n  are gradually transformed into so many propensities which they can\r\n  neither resist nor change. Hence arise habitual actions and special\r\n  _propensities_, to which we give the name of _instinct_.\r\n\r\n  \"These propensities are inherited and become innate in the young, so\r\n  that they act instinctively from the moment of birth. Thus the same\r\n  habits and instincts are perpetuated from one generation to another,\r\n  with no _notable_ variations, so long as the species does not\r\n  suffer change in the circumstances essential to its mode of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe same views are repeated in the introduction to the _Animaux sans\r\nVertèbres_ (1815), and again in 1820, in his last work, and do not need\r\nto be translated, as they are repetitions of his previously published\r\nviews in the _Philosophie zoologique_.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, to illustrate his thoughts on instinct Lamarck does not\r\ngive us any examples, nor did he apparently observe to any great extent\r\nthe habits of animals. In these days one cannot follow him in drawing a\r\nline--as regards the possession of instincts--between the lowest\r\norganisms, or Protozoa, and the groups provided with a nervous system.\r\n\r\n_Lamarck's meaning of the word \"besoins,\" or wants or needs._--Lamarck's\r\nuse of the word wants or needs (_besoins_) has, we think, been greatly\r\nmisunderstood and at times caricatured or pronounced as \"absurd.\" The\r\ndistinguished French naturalist, Quatrefages, although he was not\r\nhimself an evolutionist, has protested against the way Lamarck's views\r\nhave been caricatured. By nearly all authors he is represented as\r\nclaiming that by simply \"willing\" or \"desiring\" the individual bird or\r\nother animal radically and with more or less rapidity changed its shape\r\nor that of some particular organ or part of the body. This is, as we\r\nhave seen, by no means what he states. In no instance does he speak of\r\nan animal as simply \"desiring\" to modify an organ in any way. The\r\ndoctrine of appetency attributed to Lamarck is without foundation. In\r\nall the examples given he intimates that owing to changes in\r\nenvironment, leading to isolation in a new area separating a large\r\nnumber of individuals from their accustomed habitat, they are driven by\r\nnecessity (_besoin_) or new needs to adopt a new or different mode of\r\nlife--new habits. These efforts, whatever they may be--such as attempts\r\nto fly, swim, wade, climb, burrow, etc., continued for a long time \"in\r\nall the individuals of its species,\" or the great number forced by\r\ncompetition to migrate and become segregated from the others of the\r\noriginal species--finally, owing to the changed surroundings, affect the\r\nmass of individuals thus isolated, and their organs thus exercised in a\r\nspecial direction undergo a slow modification.\r\n\r\nEven so careful a writer as Dr. Alfred R. Wallace does not quite fairly,\r\nor with exactness, state what Lamarck says, when in his classical essay\r\nof 1858 he represents Lamarck as stating that the giraffe acquired its\r\nlong neck by _desiring_ to reach the foliage of the more lofty shrubs,\r\nand constantly stretching its neck for the purpose. On the contrary, he\r\ndoes not use the word \"desiring\" at all. What Lamarck does say is that--\r\n\r\n  \"The giraffe lives in dry, desert places, without herbage, so that\r\n  it is obliged to browse on the leaves of trees, and is continually\r\n  forced to reach up to them. It results from this habit, continued\r\n  for a long time in all the individuals of its species, that its fore\r\n  limbs have become so elongated that the giraffe, without raising\r\n  itself erect on its hind legs, raises its head and reaches six\r\n  meters high (almost twenty feet).\"[192]\r\n\r\nWe submit that this mode of evolution of the giraffe is quite as\r\nreasonable as the very hypothetical one advanced by Mr. Wallace;[193]\r\n_i.e._, that a variety occurred with a longer neck than usual, and these\r\n\"at once secured a fresh range of pasture over the same ground as their\r\nshorter-necked companions, and on the first scarcity of food were\r\nthereby enabled to outlive them.\" Mr. Wallace's account also of\r\nLamarck's general theory appears to us to be one-sided, inadequate, and\r\nmisleading. He states it thus: \"The hypothesis of Lamarck--that\r\nprogressive changes in species have been produced by the attempts of\r\nanimals to increase the development of their own organs, and thus modify\r\ntheir structure and habits.\" This is a caricature of what Lamarck really\r\ntaught. Wants, needs (_besoins_), volitions, desires, are not mentioned\r\nby Lamarck in his two fundamental laws (see p. 303), and when the word\r\n_besoins_ is introduced it refers as much to the physiological needs as\r\nto the emotions of the animal resulting from some new environment which\r\nforces it to adopt new habits such as means of locomotion or of\r\nacquiring food.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident to one who has read the original or the foregoing\r\ntranslations of Lamarck's writings that he does not refer so much to\r\nmental desires or volitions as to those physiological wants or needs\r\nthrust upon the animal by change of circumstances or by competition; and\r\nhis _besoins_ may include lust, hunger, as well as the necessity of\r\nmaking muscular exertions such as walking, running, leaping, climbing,\r\nswimming, or flying.\r\n\r\nAs we understand Lamarck, when he speaks of the incipient giraffe or\r\nlong-necked bird as making efforts to reach up or outwards, the efforts\r\nmay have been as much physiological, reflex, or instinctive as mental. A\r\nrecent writer, Dr. R. T. Jackson, curiously and yet naturally enough\r\nuses the same phraseology as Lamarck when he says that the long siphon\r\nof the common clam (Mya) \"was brought about by the effort to reach the\r\nsurface, induced by the habit of deep burial\" in its hole.[194]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, can we in the higher vertebrates entirely dissociate\r\nthe emotional and mental activities from their physiological or\r\ninstinctive acts? Mr. Darwin, in his _Expressions of the Emotions in Man\r\nand Animals_, discusses in an interesting and detailed way the effects\r\nof the feelings and passions on some of the higher animals.\r\n\r\nIt is curious, also, that Dr. Erasmus Darwin went at least as far as\r\nLamarck in claiming that the transformations of animals \"are in part\r\nproduced by their own exertions in consequence of their desires and\r\naversions, of their pleasures and their pains, or of irritations or of\r\nassociations.\"\r\n\r\nCope, in the final chapter of his _Primary Factors of Organic\r\nEvolution_, entitled \"The Functions of Consciousness,\" goes to much\r\nfarther extremes than the French philosopher has been accused of doing,\r\nand unhesitatingly attributes consciousness to all animals. \"Whatever be\r\nits nature,\" he says, \"the preliminary to any animal movement which is\r\nnot automatic is an effort.\" Hence he regards effort as the immediate\r\nsource of all movement, and considers that the control of muscular\r\nmovements by consciousness is distinctly observable; in fact, he even\r\ngoes to the length of affirming that reflex acts are the product of\r\nconscious acts, whereas it is plain enough that reflex acts are always\r\nthe result of some stimulus.\r\n\r\nAnother case mentioned by Lamarck in his _Animaux sans Vertèbres_, which\r\nhas been pronounced as absurd and ridiculous, and has aided in throwing\r\nhis whole theory into disfavor, is his way of accounting for the\r\ndevelopment of the tentacles of the snail, which is quoted on p. 348.\r\n\r\nThis account is a very probable and, in fact, the only rational\r\nexplanation. The initial cause of such structures is the intermittent\r\nstimulus of occasional contact with surrounding objects, the irritation\r\nthus set up causing a flow of the blood to the exposed parts receiving\r\nthe stimuli. The general cause is the same as that concerned in the\r\nproduction of horns and other hard defensive projections on the heads of\r\nvarious animals.\r\n\r\nIn commenting on this case of the snail, Professor Cleland, in his just\r\nand discriminating article on Lamarck, says:\r\n\r\n  \"However absurd this may seem, it must be admitted that, unlimited\r\n  time having been once granted for organs to be developed in series\r\n  of generations, the objections to their being formed in the way here\r\n  imagined are only such as equally apply to the theory of their\r\n  origin by natural selection.... In judging the reasonableness of the\r\n  second law of Lamarck [referring to new wants, see p. 346] as\r\n  compared with more modern and now widely received theories, it must\r\n  be observed that it is only an extension of his third law; and that\r\n  third law is a fact. The strengthening of the blacksmith's arm by\r\n  use is proverbially notorious. It is, therefore, only the\r\n  sufficiency of the Lamarckian hypothesis to explain the first\r\n  commencement of new organs which is in question, if evolution by the\r\n  mere operation of forces acting in the organic world be granted; and\r\n  surely the Darwinian theory is equally helpless to account for the\r\n  beginning of a new organ, while it demands as imperatively that\r\n  every stage in the assumed hereditary development of an organ must\r\n  have been useful.... Lamarck gave great importance to the influence\r\n  of new wants acting indirectly by stimulating growth and use. Darwin\r\n  has given like importance to the effects of accidental variations\r\n  acting indirectly by giving advantage in the struggle for existence.\r\n  The speculative writings of Darwin have, however, been interwoven\r\n  with a vast number of beautiful experiments and observations bearing\r\n  on his speculations, though by no means proving his theory of\r\n  evolution; while the speculations of Lamarck lie apart from his\r\n  wonderful descriptive labors, unrelieved by intermixture with other\r\n  matters capable of attracting the numerous class who, provided they\r\n  have new facts set before them, are not careful to limit themselves\r\n  to the conclusions strictly deducible therefrom.

He thus breaks entirely away from the old idea of a\r\ncontinuous ascending series of his predecessors Bonnet and others.\r\nProfessor R. Hertwig therefore makes a decided mistake and does Lamarck\r\na great injustice in his \"Zoölogy,\" where he states: \"Lamarck, in\r\nagreement with the then prevailing conceptions, regarded the animal\r\nkingdom as a series grading from the lowest primitive animal up to man\"\r\n(p. 26); and again, on the next page, he speaks of \"the theory of\r\nGeoffroy St.-Hilaire and Lamarck\" as having in it \"as a fundamental\r\nerror the doctrine of the serial arrangement of the animal world\"\r\n(English Trans.). Hertwig is in error, and could never have carefully\r\nread what Lamarck did say, or have known that he was the first to throw\r\naside the serial arrangement, and to sketch out a genealogical tree.\r\n\r\n[181] The foregoing pages (283-286) are reprinted by the author from the\r\n_Discours_ of 1803. See pp. 266-270.\r\n\r\n[182] Perrier thus comments on this passage: \"_Ici nous sommes bien\r\nprès, semble-t-il, non seulement de la lutte pour la vie telle one la\r\nconcevra Darwin, mais même de la sélection naturelle. Malheureusement,\r\nau lieu de poursuivre l'idée, Lamarck aussitôt s'engage dans une autre\r\nvoie_,\" etc. (_La Philosophie zoologique avant Darwin_, p. 81).\r\n\r\n[183] The expression \"_sentiment intérieur_\" may be nearly equivalent to\r\nthe \"organic sense\" of modern psychologists, but more probably\r\ncorresponds to our word consciousness.\r\n\r\n[184] Lamarck's division of _Animaux sensibles_ comprises the insects,\r\narachnids, crustacea, annelids, cirrhipedes, and molluscs.\r\n\r\n[185] Rather a strange view to take, as the brain of insects is now\r\nknown to be nearly as complex as that of mammals.\r\n\r\n[186] Richerand, _Physiologie_. vol ii. p. 151.\r\n\r\n[187] \"As all animals do not have the power of performing voluntary\r\nacts, so in like manner _instinct_ is not common to all animals: for\r\nthose lacking the nervous system also want the organic sense, and can\r\nperform no instinctive acts.\r\n\r\n\"These imperfect animals are entirely passive, they do nothing of\r\nthemselves, they have no wants, and nature as regards them treats them\r\nas she does plants. But as they are irritable in their parts, the means\r\nwhich nature employs to maintain their existence enables them to execute\r\nmovements which we call actions.\"\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that Lamarck practically regards the lowest animals as\r\nautomata, but we must remember that the line he draws between animals\r\nwith and without a nervous system is an artificial one, as some of the\r\nforms which he supposed to be destitute of a nervous system are now\r\nknown to possess one.\r\n\r\n[188] It should be noticed that Lamarck does not absolutely state that\r\nthere are no variations whatever in instinct. His words are much less\r\npositive: \"_Sans offrer de variation notable._\" This dues not exclude\r\nthe fact, discovered since his time, that instincts are more or less\r\nvariable, thus affording grounds for Darwin's theory of the origin of\r\nnew kinds of instincts from the \"accidental variation of instincts.\"\r\nProfessor James' otherwise excellent version of Lamarck's view is\r\ninexact and misleading when he makes Lamarck say that instincts are\r\n\"perpetuated _without variation_ from one generation to another, so long\r\nas the outward conditions of existence remain the same\" (_The Principles\r\nof Psychology_, vol. ii., p. 678, 1890). He leaves out the word notable.\r\nThe italics are ours. Farther on (p. 337), it will be seen that Lamarck\r\nacknowledges that in birds and mammals instinct is variable.\r\n\r\n[189] It is interesting to compare with this Darwin's theory of the\r\norigin of the same animals, the flying squirrels and Galeopithecus\r\n(_Origin of Species_, 5th edition, New York, pp. 173-174), and see how\r\nhe invokes the Lamarckian factors of change of \"climate and vegetation\"\r\nand \"changing conditions of life,\" to originate the variations before\r\nnatural selection can act. His account is a mixture of Lamarckism with\r\nthe added Darwinian factors of competition and natural selection. We\r\nagree with this view, that the change in environment and competition\r\nsets the ball in motion, the work being finished by the selective\r\nprocess. The act of springing and the first attempts at flying also\r\ninvolve strong emotions and mental efforts, and it can hardly be denied\r\nthat these Lamarckian factors came into continual play during the\r\nprocess of evolution of these flying creatures.\r\n\r\n[190] This sagacious, though crude suggestion of the origin of birds and\r\nmammals from the reptiles is now, after the lapse of nearly a century,\r\nbeing confirmed by modern morphologists and palæontologists.\r\n\r\n[191] Reproduced on page 193.\r\n\r\n[192] This is taken from my article, \"Lamarck and Neo-lamarckianism,\" in\r\nthe _Open Court_, Chicago, February, 1897.

Licorish, M.D., Barbadoes, 1898, reprinted in _Natural\r\nScience_, April, 1899.\r\n\r\n[193] _Natural Selection_, pp. 41-42.\r\n\r\n[194] _American Naturalist_, 1891, p. 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nLAMARCK'S THEORY AS TO THE EVOLUTION OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nLamarck's views on the origin of man are contained in his _Recherches\r\nsur l'Organisation des Corps vivans_ (1802) and his _Philosophie\r\nzoologique_, published in 1809. We give the following literal\r\ntranslation in full of the views he presented in 1802, and which were\r\nprobably first advanced in lectures to his classes.\r\n\r\n  \"As to man, his origin, his peculiar nature, I have already stated\r\n  in this book that I have not kept these subjects in view in making\r\n  these observations. His extreme superiority over the other living\r\n  creatures indicates that he is a privileged being who has in common\r\n  with the animals only that which concerns animal life.\r\n\r\n  \"In truth, we observe a sort of gradation in the intelligence of\r\n  animals, like what exists in the gradual improvement of their\r\n  organization, and we remark that they have ideas, memory; that they\r\n  think, choose, love, hate, that they are susceptible of jealousy,\r\n  and that by different inflexions of their voice and by signs they\r\n  communicate with and understand each other. It is not less evident\r\n  that man alone is endowed with reason, and that on this account he\r\n  is clearly distinguished from all the other productions of nature.\r\n\r\n  \"However, were it not for the picture that so many celebrated men\r\n  have drawn of the weakness and lack of human reason; were it not\r\n  that, independently of all the freaks into which the passions of man\r\n  almost constantly allure him, the _ignorance_ which makes him the\r\n  opinionated slave of custom and the continual dupe of those who wish\r\n  to deceive him; were it not that his reason has led him into the\r\n  most revolting errors, since we actually see him so debase himself\r\n  as to worship animals, even the meanest, of addressing to them his\r\n  prayers, and of imploring their aid; were it not, I say, for these\r\n  considerations, should we feel authorized to raise any doubts as to\r\n  the excellence of this special light which is the attribute of man?\r\n\r\n  \"An observation which has for a long time struck me is that, having\r\n  remarked that the habitual use and exercise of an organ\r\n  proportionally develops its size and functions, as the lack of\r\n  employment weakens in the same proportion its power, and even more\r\n  or less completely atrophies it, I am apprised that of all the\r\n  organs of man's body which is the most strongly submitted to this\r\n  influence, that is to say, in which the effects of exercise and of\r\n  habitual use are the most considerable, is it not the organ of\r\n  thought--in a word, is it not the brain of man?\r\n\r\n  \"Compare the extraordinary difference existing in the degree of\r\n  intelligence of a man who rarely exercises his powers of thought,\r\n  who has always been accustomed to see but a small number of things,\r\n  only those related to his ordinary wants and to his limited desires;\r\n  who at no time thinks about these same objects, because he is\r\n  obliged to occupy himself incessantly with providing for these same\r\n  wants; finally, who has few ideas, because his attention,\r\n  continually fixed on the same things, makes him notice nothing, that\r\n  he makes no comparisons, that he is in the very heart of nature\r\n  without knowing it, that he looks upon it almost in the same way as\r\n  do the beasts, and that all that surrounds him is nothing to him:\r\n  compare, I say, the intelligence of this individual with that of the\r\n  man who, prepared at the outset by education, has contracted the\r\n  useful practice of exercising the organ of his thought in devoting\r\n  himself to the study of the principal branches of knowledge; who\r\n  observes and compares everything he sees and which affects him; who\r\n  forgets himself in examining everything he can see, who insensibly\r\n  accustoms himself to judge of everything for himself, instead of\r\n  giving a blind assent to the authority of others; finally, who,\r\n  stimulated by reverses and especially by injustice, quietly rises by\r\n  reflection to the causes which have produced all that we observe\r\n  both in nature and in human society; then you will appreciate how\r\n  enormous is the difference between the intelligence of the two men\r\n  in question.\r\n\r\n  \"If Newton, Bacon, Montesquieu, Voltaire, and so many other men have\r\n  done honor to the human species by the extent of their intelligence\r\n  and their genius, how nearly does the mass of brutish, ignorant men\r\n  approach the animal, becoming a prey to the most absurd prejudices\r\n  and constantly enslaved by their habits, this mass forming the\r\n  majority of all nations?\r\n\r\n  \"Search deeply the facts in the comparison I have just made, you\r\n  will see how in one part the organ which serves for acts of thought\r\n  is perfected and acquires greater size and power, owing to sustained\r\n  and varied exercise, especially if this exercise offers no more\r\n  interruptions than are necessary to prevent the exhaustion of its\r\n  powers; and, on the other hand, you will perceive how the\r\n  circumstances which prevent an individual from exercising this\r\n  organ, or from exercising it habitually only while considering a\r\n  small number of objects which are always of the same nature, impede\r\n  the development of his intellectual faculties.\r\n\r\n  \"After what I have just stated as to the results in man of a slight\r\n  exercise of the organ by which he thinks, we shall no longer be\r\n  astonished to see that in the nations which have come to be the most\r\n  distinguished, because there is among them a small number of men who\r\n  have been able, by observation and reflection, to create or advance\r\n  the higher sciences, the multitude in these same nations have not\r\n  been for all that exempted from the most absurd errors, and have not\r\n  the less always been the dupe of impostors and victims of their\r\n  prejudices.\r\n\r\n  \"Such is, in fact, the fatality attached to the destiny of man that,\r\n  with the exception of a small number of individuals who live under\r\n  favorable though special circumstances, the multitude, forced to\r\n  continually busy itself with providing for its needs, remains\r\n  permanently deprived of the knowledge which it should acquire; in\r\n  general, exercises to a very slight extent the organ of its\r\n  intelligence; preserves and propagates a multitude of prejudices\r\n  which enslave it, and cannot be as happy as those who, guiding it,\r\n  are themselves guided by reason and justice.\r\n\r\n  \"As to the animals, besides the fact that they in descending order\r\n  have the brain less developed, they are otherwise proportionally\r\n  more limited in the means of exercising and of varying their\r\n  intellectual processes. They each exercise them only on a single or\r\n  on some special points, on which they become more or less expert\r\n  according to their species. And while their degree of organization\r\n  remains the same and the nature of their needs (_besoins_) does not\r\n  vary, they can never extend the scope of their intelligence, nor\r\n  apply it to other objects than to those which are related to their\r\n  ordinary needs.\r\n\r\n  \"Some among them, whose structure is a little more perfect than in\r\n  others, have also greater means of varying and extending their\r\n  intellectual faculties; but it is always within limits circumscribed\r\n  by their necessities and habits.\r\n\r\n  \"The power of habit which is found to be still so great in man,\r\n  especially in one who has but slightly exercised the organ of his\r\n  thought, is among animals almost insurmountable while their physical\r\n  state remains the same. Nothing compels them to vary their powers,\r\n  because they suffice for their wants and these require no change.\r\n  Hence it is constantly the same objects which exercise their degree\r\n  of intelligence, and it results that these actions are always the\r\n  same in each species.\r\n\r\n  \"The sole acts of variation, _i.e._, the only acts which rise above\r\n  the limits of habits, and which we see performed in animals whose\r\n  organization allows them to, are _acts of imitation_. I only speak\r\n  of actions which they perform voluntarily or freely (_actions qu'ils\r\n  font de leur plein gré_).\r\n\r\n  \"Birds, very limited in this respect in the powers which their\r\n  structure furnishes, can only perform acts of imitation with their\r\n  vocal organ; this organ, by their habitual efforts to render the\r\n  sounds, and to vary them, becomes in them very perfect. Thus we know\r\n  that several birds (the parrot, starling, raven, jay, magpie, canary\r\n  bird, etc.) imitate the sounds they hear.\r\n\r\n  \"The monkeys, which are, next to man, the animals by their structure\r\n  having the best means to this end, are most excellent imitators, and\r\n  there is no limit to the things they can mimic.\r\n\r\n  \"In man, infants which are still of the age when simple ideas are\r\n  formed on various subjects, and who think but little, forming no\r\n  complex ideas, are also very good imitators of everything which they\r\n  see or hear.\r\n\r\n  \"But if each order of things in animals is dependent on the state\r\n  of organization occurring in each of them, which is not doubted,\r\n  there is no occasion for thinking that in these same animals the\r\n  order which is superior to all the others in organization is\r\n  proportionally so also in extent of means, invariability of actions,\r\n  and consequently in intellectual powers.\r\n\r\n  \"For example, in the mammals which are the most highly organized,\r\n  the _Quadrumana_, which form a part of them, have, besides the\r\n  advantages over other mammals, a conformation in several of their\r\n  organs which considerably increases their powers, which allows of a\r\n  great variability in their actions, and which extends and even makes\r\n  predominant their intelligence, enabling them to deal with a greater\r\n  variety of objects with which to exercise their brain. It will\r\n  doubtless be said: But although man may be a true mammal in his\r\n  general structure, and although among the mammals the _Quadrumana_\r\n  are most nearly allied to him, this will not be denied, not only\r\n  that man is strongly distinguished from the _Quadrumana_ by a great\r\n  superiority of intelligence, but he is also very considerably so in\r\n  several structural features which characterize him.\r\n\r\n  \"First, the occipital foramen being situated entirely at the base of\r\n  the cranium of man and not carried up behind, as in the other\r\n  vertebrates, causes his head to be posed at the extremity of the\r\n  vertebral column as on a pivot, not bowed down forward, his face not\r\n  looking towards the ground. This position of the head of man, who\r\n  can easily turn it to different sides, enables him to see better a\r\n  larger number of objects at one time, than the much inclined\r\n  position of the head of other mammals allows them to see.\r\n\r\n  \"Secondly, the remarkable mobility of the fingers of the hand of\r\n  man, which he employs either all together or several together, or\r\n  each separately, according to his pleasure, and besides, the sense\r\n  of touch highly developed at the extremity of these same fingers,\r\n  enables him to judge the nature of the bodies which surround him, to\r\n  recognize them, to make use of them--means which no other animals\r\n  possess to such a degree.\r\n\r\n  \"Thirdly, by the state of his organization man is able to hold\r\n  himself up and walk erect. He has, for this attitude which is\r\n  natural to him, large muscles at the lower extremities which are\r\n  adapted to this end, and it would thus be as difficult to walk\r\n  habitually on his four extremities as it would be for the other\r\n  mammals, and even for the _Quadrumana_, to walk so habitually erect\r\n  on the soles of their feet.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, man is not truly quadrumanous; for he has not, like the\r\n  monkeys, an almost equal facility in using the fingers of his feet,\r\n  and of seizing objects with them. In the feet of man the thumbs are\r\n  not in opposition to the other fingers to use in grasping, as in\r\n  monkeys, etc.\r\n\r\n  \"I appreciate all these reasons, and I see that man, although near\r\n  the _Quadrumana_, is so distinct that he alone represents a separate\r\n  order, belonging to a single genus and species, offering, however,\r\n  many different varieties. This order may be, if it is desired, that\r\n  of the _Bimana_.\r\n\r\n  \"However, if we consider that all the characteristics which have\r\n  been cited are only differences in degree of structure, may we not\r\n  suppose that this special condition of organization of man _has been\r\n  gradually acquired at the close of a long period of time, with the\r\n  aid of circumstances which have proved favorable?_[195] What a\r\n  subject for reflection for those who have the courage to enter into\r\n  it!\r\n\r\n  \"If the _Quadrumana_ have not the occipital opening situated\r\n  directly at the base of the cranium as in man, it is assuredly much\r\n  less raised posteriorly than in the dog, cat, and all the other\r\n  mammals. Thus they all may quite often stand erect, although this\r\n  attitude for them is very irksome.\r\n\r\n  \"I have not observed the situation of the occipital opening of the\r\n  jacko or orang-outang (_Simia satyrus_ L.); but as I know that this\r\n  animal almost habitually walks erect, though it has no strength in\r\n  its legs, I suppose that the occipital foramen is not situated so\r\n  far from the base of the skull as in the other _Quadrumana_.\r\n\r\n  \"The head of the negro, less flattened in front than that of the\r\n  European man, necessarily has the occipital foramen central.\r\n\r\n  \"The more should the jacko contract the habit of walking about, the\r\n  less mobility would he have in his toes, so that the thumbs of the\r\n  feet, which are already much shorter than the other digits, would\r\n  gradually cease to be placed in opposition to the other toes, and to\r\n  be useful in grasping. The muscles of its lower extremities would\r\n  acquire proportionally greater thickness and strength. Then the\r\n  increased or more frequent exercise of the fingers of its hands\r\n  would develop nervous masses at their extremities, thus rendering\r\n  the sense of touch more delicate. This is what our train of\r\n  reasoning indicates from the consideration of a multitude of facts\r\n  and observations which support it.\"[196]\r\n\r\nThe subject is closed by a quotation from Grandpré on the habits of the\r\nchimpanzee. It is not of sufficient importance to be here reproduced.\r\n\r\nSeven years after the publication of these views, Lamarck again returns\r\nto the subject in his _Philosophie zoologique_, which we translate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_Some Observations Relative to Man_.\r\n\r\n  \"If man were distinguished from the animals by his structure alone,\r\n  it would be easy to show that the structural characters which place\r\n  him, with his varieties, in a family by himself, are all the product\r\n  of former changes in his actions, and in the habits which he has\r\n  adopted and which have become special to the individuals of his\r\n  species.\r\n\r\n  \"Indeed, if any race whatever of _Quadrumana_, especially the most\r\n  perfect, should lose, by the necessity of circumstances or from any\r\n  other cause, the habit of climbing trees, and of seizing the\r\n  branches with the feet, as with the hands, to cling to them; and if\r\n  the individuals of this race, during a series of generations, should\r\n  be obliged to use their feet only in walking, and should cease to\r\n  use their hands as feet, there is no doubt, from the observations\r\n  made in the preceding chapter, that these _Quadrumana_ would be\r\n  finally transformed into _Bimana_, and that the thumbs of their feet\r\n  would cease to be shorter than the fingers, their feet only being of\r\n  use for walking.\r\n\r\n  \"Moreover, if the individuals of which I speak were impelled by the\r\n  necessity of rising up and of looking far and wide, of endeavoring\r\n  to stand erect, and of adopting this habit constantly from\r\n  generation to generation, there is no doubt that their feet would\r\n  gradually and imperceptibly assume a conformation adapted for an\r\n  erect posture, that their legs would develop calves, and that these\r\n  creatures would not afterwards walk as they do now, painfully on\r\n  both hands and feet.\r\n\r\n  \"Also, if these same individuals should cease using their jaws for\r\n  biting in self-defence, tearing or seizing, or using them like\r\n  nippers in cutting leaves for food, and should they only be used in\r\n  chewing food, there is no doubt that their facial angle would become\r\n  higher, that their muzzle would become shorter and shorter, and that\r\n  in the end this being entirely effaced, their incisor teeth would\r\n  become vertical.\r\n\r\n  \"Now supposing that a race of _Quadrumana_, as for example the most\r\n  perfect, had acquired, by habits constant in every individual, the\r\n  structure I have just described, and the power of standing erect and\r\n  of walking upright, and that as the result of this it had come to\r\n  dominate the other races of animals, we should then conceive:\r\n\r\n  \"1. That this race farther advanced in its faculties, having arrived\r\n  at the stage when it lords it over the others, will be spread over\r\n  the surface of the globe in every suitable place;\r\n\r\n  \"2. That it will hunt the other higher races of animals and will\r\n  struggle with them for preëminence (_lui disputer les biens de la\r\n  terre_) and that it will force them to take refuge in regions which\r\n  it does not occupy;\r\n\r\n  \"3. That being injured by the great multiplication of closely allied\r\n  races, and having banished them into forests or other desert places,\r\n  it will arrest the progress of improvement in their faculties, while\r\n  its own self, the ruler of the region over which it spreads, will\r\n  increase in population without hindrance on the part of others, and,\r\n  living in numerous tribes, will in succession create new needs which\r\n  should stimulate industry and gradually render still more perfect\r\n  its means and powers;\r\n\r\n  \"4. That, finally, this preëminent race having acquired an absolute\r\n  supremacy over all the others, there arose between it and the\r\n  highest animals a difference and indeed a considerable interval.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus the most perfect race of _Quadrumana_ will have been enabled\r\n  to become dominant, to change its habits as the result of the\r\n  absolute dominion which it will have assumed over the others, and\r\n  with its new needs, by progressively acquiring modifications in its\r\n  structure and its new and numerous powers, to keep within due limits\r\n  the most highly developed of the other races in the state to which\r\n  they had advanced, and to create between it and these last very\r\n  remarkable distinctions.\r\n\r\n  \"The Angola orang (_Simia troglodytes_ Lin.) is the highest animal;\r\n  it is much more perfect than the orang of the Indies (_Simia\r\n  satyrus_ Lin.), which is called the orang-outang, and, nevertheless,\r\n  as regards their structure they are both very inferior to man in\r\n  bodily faculties and intelligence. These animals often stand erect;\r\n  but this attitude is not habitual, their organization not having\r\n  been sufficiently modified, so that standing still (_station_) is\r\n  painful for them.\r\n\r\n  \"It is known, from the accounts of travellers, especially in regard\r\n  to the orang of the Indies, that when immediate danger obliges it to\r\n  fly, it immediately falls on all fours. This betrays, they tell us,\r\n  the true origin of this animal, since it is obliged to abandon the\r\n  alien unaccustomed partially erect attitude which is thrust upon it.\r\n\r\n  \"Without doubt this attitude is foreign to it, since in its change\r\n  of locality it makes less use of it, which shows that its\r\n  organization is less adapted to it; but though it has become easier\r\n  for man to stand up straight, is the erect posture wholly natural to\r\n  him?\r\n\r\n  \"Although man, who, by his habits, maintained in the individuals of\r\n  his species during a great series of generations, can stand erect\r\n  only while changing from one place to another, this attitude is not\r\n  less in his case a condition of fatigue, during which he is able to\r\n  maintain himself in an upright position only during a limited time\r\n  and with the aid of the contraction of several of his muscles.\r\n\r\n  \"If the vertebral column of the human body should form the axis of\r\n  this body, and sustain the head in equilibrium, as also the other\r\n  parts, the man standing would be in a state of rest. But who does\r\n  not know that this is not so; that the head is not articulated at\r\n  its centre of gravity; that the chest and stomach, as also the\r\n  viscera which these cavities contain, weigh heavily almost entirely\r\n  on the anterior part of the vertebral column; that the latter rests\r\n  on an oblique base, etc.? Also, as M. Richerand observes, there is\r\n  needed in standing a force active and watching without ceasing to\r\n  prevent the body from falling over, the weight and disposition of\r\n  parts tending to make the body fall forward.\r\n\r\n  \"After having developed the considerations regarding the standing\r\n  posture of man, the same savant then expresses himself: 'The\r\n  relative weight of the head, of the thoracic and abdominal viscera,\r\n  tends therefore to throw it in front of the line, according to which\r\n  all the parts of the body bear down on the ground sustaining it; a\r\n  line which should be exactly perpendicular to this ground in order\r\n  that the standing position may be perfect. The following fact\r\n  supports this assertion: I have observed that infants with a large\r\n  head, the stomach protruding and the viscera loaded with fat,\r\n  accustom themselves with difficulty to stand up straight, and it is\r\n  not until the end of their second year that they dare to surrender\r\n  themselves to their proper forces; they stand subject to frequent\r\n  falls and have a natural tendency to revert to the quadrupedal\r\n  state.' (_Physiologie_, vol. ii., p. 268.)\r\n\r\n  \"This disposition of the parts which cause the erect position of\r\n  man, being a state of activity, and consequently fatiguing, instead\r\n  of being a state of rest, would then betray in him an origin\r\n  analogous to that of the mammals, if his organization alone should\r\n  be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n  \"Now in order to follow, in all its particulars, the hypothesis\r\n  presented in the beginning of these observations, it is fitting to\r\n  add the following considerations:\r\n\r\n  \"The individuals of the dominant race previously mentioned, having\r\n  taken possession of all the inhabitable places which were suitable\r\n  for them, and having to a very considerable extent multiplied their\r\n  necessities in proportion as the societies which they formed became\r\n  more numerous, were able equally to increase their ideas, and\r\n  consequently to feel the need of communicating them to their\r\n  fellows. We conceive that there would arise the necessity of\r\n  increasing and of varying in the same proportion the _signs_ adopted\r\n  for the communication of these ideas. It is then evident that the\r\n  members of this race would have to make continual efforts, and to\r\n  employ every possible means in these efforts, to create, multiply,\r\n  and render sufficiently varied the _signs_ which their ideas and\r\n  their numerous wants would render necessary.\r\n\r\n  \"It is not so with any other animals; because, although the most\r\n  perfect among them, such as the _Quadrumana_, live mostly in troops,\r\n  since the eminent supremacy of the race mentioned they have remained\r\n  stationary as regards the improvement of their faculties, having\r\n  been driven out from everywhere and banished to wild, desert,\r\n  usually restricted regions, whither, miserable and restless, they\r\n  are incessantly constrained to fly and hide themselves. In this\r\n  situation these animals no longer contract new needs, they acquire\r\n  no new ideas; they have but a small number of them, and it is always\r\n  the same ones which occupy their attention, and among these ideas\r\n  there are very few which they have need of communicating to the\r\n  other individuals of their species. There are, then, only very few\r\n  different _signs_ which they employ among their fellows, so that\r\n  some movements of the body or of certain of its parts, certain\r\n  hisses and cries raised by the simple inflexions of the voice,\r\n  suffice them.\r\n\r\n  \"On the contrary, the individuals of the dominant race already\r\n  mentioned, having had need of multiplying the _signs_ for the rapid\r\n  communication of their ideas, now become more and more numerous,\r\n  and, no longer contented either with pantomimic signs or possible\r\n  inflexions of their voice to represent this multitude of signs now\r\n  become necessary, would succeed by different efforts in forming\r\n  _articulated sounds_: at first they would use only a small number,\r\n  conjointly with the inflexions of their voice; as the result they\r\n  would multiply, vary, and perfect them, according to their\r\n  increasing necessities, and according as they would be more\r\n  accustomed to produce them. Indeed, the habitual exercise of their\r\n  throat, their tongue, and their lips to make articulate sounds, will\r\n  have eminently developed in them this faculty.\r\n\r\n  \"Hence for this particular race the origin of the wonderful power of\r\n  _speech_; and as the distance between the regions where the\r\n  individuals composing it would be spread would favor the corruption\r\n  of the signs fitted to express each idea, from this arose the origin\r\n  of languages, which must be everywhere diversified.\r\n\r\n  \"Then in this respect necessities alone would have accomplished\r\n  everything; they would give origin to efforts; and the organs fitted\r\n  for the articulation of sounds would be developed by their habitual\r\n  use.\r\n\r\n  \"Such would be the reflections which might be made if man,\r\n  considered here as the preëminent race in question, were\r\n  distinguished from the animals only by his physical characters, and\r\n  if his origin were not different from theirs.\"\r\n\r\nThis is certainly, for the time it was written, an original,\r\ncomprehensive, and bold attempt at explaining in a tentative way, or at\r\nleast suggesting, the probable origin of man from some arboreal creature\r\nallied to the apes. It is as regards the actual evolutional steps\r\nsupposed to have been taken by the simian ancestors of man, a more\r\ndetailed and comprehensive hypothesis than that offered by Darwin in his\r\n_Descent of Man_,[197] which Lamarck has anticipated. Darwin does not\r\nrefer to this theory of Lamarck, and seems to have entirely overlooked\r\nit, as have others since his time. The theory of the change from an\r\narboreal life and climbing posture to an erect one, and the\r\ntransformation of the hinder pair of hands into the feet of the erect\r\nhuman animal, remind us of the very probable hypothesis of Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer, as to the modification of the quadrumanous posterior pair of\r\nhands to form the plantigrade feet of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[195] Author's italics.\r\n\r\n[196] \"How much this unclean beast resembles man!\"--_Ennius_.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, besides other resemblances the monkey has mammæ, a clitoris,\r\nnymphs, uterus, uvula, eye-lobes, nails, as in the human species; it\r\nalso lacks a suspensory ligament of the neck.

He looked upon every problem in a large way. His breadth of\r\nview, his moral and intellectual strength, his equably developed nature,\r\ngenerous in its sympathies and aspiring in its tendencies, naturally led\r\nhim to take a conservative position as to the relations between science\r\nand religion. He should, as may be inferred from his frequent references\r\nto the Author of nature, be regarded as a deist.\r\n\r\nWhen a very young man, he was for a time a friend of the erratic and\r\ngifted Rousseau, and was afterwards not unknown to Condorcet, the\r\nsecretary of the French Academy of Sciences, so liberal in his views and\r\nso bitter an enemy of the Church; and though constantly in contact with\r\nthe radical views and burning questions of that day, Lamarck throughout\r\nhis life preserved his philosophic calm, and maintained his lofty tone\r\nand firm temper. We find no trace in his writings of sentiments other\r\nthan the most elevated and inspiring, and we know that in character he\r\nwas pure and sweet, self-sacrificing, self-denying, and free from\r\nself-assertion.\r\n\r\nThe quotations from his _Philosophie zoologique_, published in 1809,\r\ngiven below, will show what were the results of his meditations on the\r\nrelations between science and religion. Had his way of looking at this\r\nsubject prevailed, how much misunderstanding and ill-feeling between\r\ntheologians and savants would have been avoided! Had his spirit and\r\nbreadth of view animated both parties, there would not have been the\r\nconstant and needless opposition on the part of the Church to the grand\r\nresults of scientific discovery and philosophy, or too hasty dogmatism\r\nand scepticism on the part of some scientists.\r\n\r\nIn Lamarck, at the opening of the past century, we behold the spectacle\r\nof a man devoting over fifty years of his life to scientific research in\r\nbiology, and insisting on the doctrine of spontaneous generation; of the\r\nimmense length of geological time, so opposed to the views held by the\r\nChurch; the evolution of plants and animals from a single germ, and even\r\nthe origin of man from the apes, yet as earnestly claiming that nature\r\nhas its Author who in the beginning established the order of things,\r\ngiving the initial impulse to the laws of the universe.\r\n\r\nAs Duval says, after quoting the passage given below: \"Deux faits son à\r\nnoter dans ce passage: d'une part, les termes dignes et conciliants dans\r\nlesquels Lamarck établit la part de la science et de la religion; cela\r\nvaut, mieux, même en tenant compte des différences d'epoques, que les\r\nabjurations de Buffon.\"[198]\r\n\r\nThe passage quoted by M. Duval is the following one:\r\n\r\n  \"Surely nothing exists except by the will of the Sublime Author of\r\n  all things. But can we not assign him laws in the execution of his\r\n  will, and determine the method which he has followed in this\r\n  respect? Has not his infinite power enabled him to create an order\r\n  of things which has successively given existence to all that we see,\r\n  as well as to that which exists and that of which we have no\r\n  knowledge? As regards the decrees of this infinite wisdom, I have\r\n  confined myself to the limits of a simple observer of nature.\"[199]\r\n\r\nIn other places we find the following expressions:\r\n\r\n  \"There is then, for the animals as for the plants, an order which\r\n  belongs to nature, and which results, as also the objects which this\r\n  order makes exist, from the power which it has received from the\r\n  SUPREME AUTHOR of all things. She is herself only the general and\r\n  unchangeable order that this Sublime Author has created throughout,\r\n  and only the totality of the general and special laws to which this\r\n  order is subject. By these means, whose use it continues without\r\n  change, it has given and will perpetually give existence to its\r\n  productions; it varies and renews them unceasingly, and thus\r\n  everywhere preserves the whole order which is the result of\r\n  it.\"[200]\r\n\r\n       ~       ~       ~       ~       ~\r\n\r\n  \"To regard nature as eternal, and consequently as having existed\r\n  from all time, is to me an abstract idea, baseless, limitless,\r\n  improbable, and not satisfactory to my reason. Being unable to know\r\n  anything positive in this respect, and having no means of reasoning\r\n  on this subject, I much prefer to think that _all nature_ is only a\r\n  result: hence, I suppose, and I am glad to admit it, a first cause,\r\n  in a word, a supreme power which has given existence to nature, and\r\n  which has made it in all respects what it is.\"[201]\r\n\r\n       ~       ~       ~       ~       ~\r\n\r\n  \"Nature, that immense totality of different beings and bodies, in\r\n  every part of which exists an eternal circle of movements and\r\n  changes regulated by law; totality alone unchangeable, so long as it\r\n  pleases its SUBLIME AUTHOR to cause its existence, should be\r\n  regarded as a whole constituted by its parts, for a purpose which\r\n  its Author alone knows, and not exclusively for any one of them.\r\n\r\n  \"Each part is necessarily obliged to change, and to cease to be one\r\n  in order to constitute another, with interests opposed to those of\r\n  all; and if it has the power of reasoning it finds this whole\r\n  imperfect. In reality, however, this whole is perfect and completely\r\n  fulfils the end for which it was designed.\"[202]\r\n\r\nLamarck's work on general philosophy[203] was written near the end of\r\nhis life, in 1820. He begins his \"Discours préliminaire\" by referring to\r\nthe sudden loss of his eyesight, his work on the invertebrate animals\r\nbeing thereby interrupted. The book was, he says, \"rapidly\" dictated to\r\nhis daughter, and the ease with which he dictated was due, he says, to\r\nhis long-continued habit of meditating on the facts he had observed.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Principes primordiaux\" he considers man as the only being who\r\nhas the power of observing nature, and the only one who has perceived\r\nthe necessity of recognizing a superior and only cause, creator of the\r\norder of the wonders of the world of life. By this he is led to raise\r\nhis thoughts to the _Supreme Author_ of all that exists.\r\n\r\n  \"In the creation of his works, and especially those we can observe,\r\n  this omnipotent Being has undoubtedly been the ruling power in\r\n  pursuing the method which has pleased him, namely, his will has\r\n  been:\r\n\r\n  \"Either to create instantaneously and separately every particular\r\n  living being observed by us, to personally care for and watch over\r\n  them in all their changes, their movements, or their actions, to\r\n  unremittingly care for each one separately, and by the exercise of\r\n  his supreme will to regulate all their life;\r\n\r\n  \"Or to reduce his creations to a small number, and among these, to\r\n  institute an order of things general and continuous, pervaded by\r\n  ceaseless activity (_mouvement_), especially subject to laws by\r\n  means of which all the organisms of whatever nature, all the changes\r\n  they undergo, all the peculiarities they present, and all the\r\n  phenomena that many of them exhibit, may be produced.\r\n\r\n  \"In regard to these two modes of execution, if observation taught us\r\n  nothing we could not form any opinion which would be well grounded.\r\n  But it is not so; we distinctly see that there exists an order of\r\n  things truly created (_véritablement créé_), as unchangeable as its\r\n  author allows, acting on matter alone, and which possesses the power\r\n  of producing all visible beings, of executing all the changes, all\r\n  the modifications, even the extinctions, so also the renewals or\r\n  recreations that we observe among them. It is to this order of\r\n  things that we have given the name of _nature_. The Supreme Author\r\n  of all that exists is, then, the immediate creator of matter as also\r\n  of nature, but he is only indirectly the creator of what nature can\r\n  produce.\r\n\r\n  \"The end that God has proposed to himself in creating matter, which\r\n  forms the basis of all bodies, and nature, which divides (_divise_)\r\n  this matter, forms the bodies, makes them vary, modifies them,\r\n  changes them, and renews them in different ways, can be easily known\r\n  to us; for the Supreme Being cannot meet with any obstacle to his\r\n  will in the execution of his works; the general results of these\r\n  works are necessarily the object he had in view. Thus this end could\r\n  be no other than the existence of nature, of which matter alone\r\n  forms the sphere, and should not be that causing the creation of any\r\n  special being.\r\n\r\n  \"Do we find in the two objects created, _i.e._, _matter_ and\r\n  _nature_, the source of the good and evil which have almost always\r\n  been thought to exist in the events of this world? To this question\r\n  I shall answer that good and evil are only relative to particular\r\n  objects, that they never affect by their temporary existence the\r\n  general result expected (_prévu_), and that for the end which the\r\n  Creator designed, there is in reality neither good nor evil, because\r\n  everything in nature perfectly fulfils its object.\r\n\r\n  \"Has God limited his creations to the existence of only matter and\r\n  nature? This question is vain, and should remain without an answer\r\n  on our part; because, being reduced to knowing anything only through\r\n  observation, and to bodies alone, also to what concerns them, these\r\n  being for us the only observable objects, it would be rash to speak\r\n  affirmatively or negatively on this subject.\r\n\r\n  \"What is a spiritual being? It is what, with the aid of the\r\n  imagination, one would naturally suppose (_l'on vaudra supposer_).\r\n  Indeed, it is only by means of opposing that which is material that\r\n  we can form the idea of spirit; but as this hypothetical being is\r\n  not in the category of objects which it is possible for us to\r\n  observe, we do not know how to take cognizance of it. The idea that\r\n  we have of it is absolutely without base.\r\n\r\n  \"We only know physical objects and only objects relative to these\r\n  beings (_êtres_): such is the condition of our nature. If our\r\n  thoughts, our reasonings, our principles have been considered as\r\n  metaphysical objects, these objects, then, are not beings (_êtres_).\r\n  They are only relations or consequences of relations (_rapports_),\r\n  or only results of observed laws.\r\n\r\n  \"We know that relations are distinguished as general and special.\r\n  Among these last are regarded those of nature, form, dimension,\r\n  solidity, size, quantity, resemblance, and difference; and if we add\r\n  to these objects the being observed and the consideration of known\r\n  laws, as also that of conventional objects, we shall have all the\r\n  materials on which our thoughts are based.\r\n\r\n  \"Thus being able to observe only the phenomena of nature, as well as\r\n  the laws which regulate these phenomena, also the products of these\r\n  last, in a word, only bodies (_corps_) and what concerns them, all\r\n  that which immediately proceeds from supreme power is\r\n  incomprehensible to us, as it itself [_i.e._, supreme power] is to\r\n  our minds. To create, or to make anything out of nothing, this is an\r\n  idea we cannot conceive of, for the reason that in all that we can\r\n  know, we do not find any model which represents it. GOD alone, then,\r\n  can create, while nature can only produce. We must suppose that, in\r\n  his creations, the Divinity is not restricted to the use of any\r\n  time, while, on the other hand, nature can effect nothing without\r\n  the aid of long periods of time.\"\r\n\r\nWithout translating more of this remarkable book, which is very rare,\r\nmuch less known than the _Philosophie zoologique_, the spirit of the\r\nremainder may be imagined from the foregoing extracts.\r\n\r\nThe author refers to the numerous evils resulting from ignorance, false\r\nknowledge, lack of judgment, abuse of power, demonstrating the necessity\r\nof our confining ourselves within the circle of the objects presented by\r\nnature, and never to go beyond them if we do not wish to fall into\r\nerror, because the profound study of nature and of the organization of\r\nman alone, and the exact observation of facts alone, will reveal to us\r\n\"the truths most important for us to know,\" in order to avoid the\r\nvexations, the perfidies, the injustices, and the oppressions of all\r\nsorts, and \"incalculable disorders\" which arise in the social body. In\r\nthis way only shall we discover and acquire the means of obtaining the\r\nenjoyment of the advantages which we have a right to expect from our\r\nstate of civilization. The author endeavors to state what science can\r\nand should render to society. He dwells on the sources from which man\r\nhas drawn the knowledge which he possesses, and from which he can obtain\r\nmany others--sources the totality of which constitutes for him the field\r\nof realities.\r\n\r\nLamarck also in this work has built up a system for moral philosophy.\r\n\r\nSelf-love, he says, perfectly regulated, gives rise:\r\n\r\n1. To moral force which characterizes the laborious man, so that the\r\nlength and difficulties of a useful work do not repel him.\r\n\r\n2. To the courage of him who, knowing the danger, exposes himself when\r\nhe sees that this would be useful.\r\n\r\n3. To love of wisdom.\r\n\r\nWisdom, according to Lamarck, consists in the observance of a certain\r\nnumber of rules or virtues. These we cite in a slightly abridged form.\r\n\r\nLove of truth in all things; the need of improving one's mind;\r\nmoderation in desires; decorum in all actions; a wise reserve in\r\nunessential wants; indulgence, toleration, humanity, good will towards\r\nall men; love of the public good and of all that is necessary to our\r\nfellows; contempt for weakness; a kind of severity towards one's self\r\nwhich preserves us from that multitude of artificial wants enslaving\r\nthose who give up to them; resignation and, if possible, moral\r\nimpassibility in suffering reverses, injustices, oppression, and losses;\r\nrespect for order, for public institutions, civil authorities, laws,\r\nmorality, and religion.\r\n\r\nThe practice of these maxims and virtues, says Lamarck, characterizes\r\ntrue philosophy.\r\n\r\nAnd it may be added that no one practised these virtues more than\r\nLamarck. Like Cuvier's, his life was blameless, and though he lived a\r\nmost retired life, and was not called upon to fill any public station\r\nother than his chair of zoölogy at the Jardin des Plantes, we may feel\r\nsure that he had the qualities of courage, independence, and patriotism\r\nwhich would have rendered such a career most useful to his country.\r\n\r\nAs Bourguin eloquently asserts: \"Lamarck was the brave man who never\r\ndeserted a dangerous post, the laborious man who never hesitated to meet\r\nany difficulty, the investigating spirit, firm in his convictions,\r\ntolerant of the opinions of others, the simple man, moderate in all\r\nthings, the enemy of weakness, devoted to the public good, imperturbable\r\nunder the attaints of fortune, of suffering, and of unjust and\r\npassionate attacks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[198] Mathias Duval: \"Le transformiste français Lamarck,\" _Bulletin de\r\nla Société d'Anthropologie de Paris_, xii., 1889, p. 345.\r\n\r\n[199] _Philosophie zoologique_, p. 56.\r\n\r\n[200] _Loc. cit._, i., p. 113.\r\n\r\n[201] _Loc. cit._, i., p. 361.\r\n\r\n[202] _Loc. cit._, ii., p. 465.\r\n\r\n[203] _Système analytique des Connaissances de l'Homme_, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE RELATIONS BETWEEN LAMARCKISM AND DARWINISM; NEOLAMARCKISM\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the appearance of Darwin's _Origin of Species_, and after the\r\ngreat naturalist had converted the world to a belief in the general\r\ndoctrine of evolution, there has arisen in the minds of many working\r\nnaturalists a conviction that natural selection, or Darwinism as such,\r\nis only one of other evolutionary factors; while there are some who\r\nentirely reject the selective principle. Darwin, moreover, assumed a\r\ntendency to fortuitous variation, and did not attempt to explain its\r\ncause. Fully persuaded that he had discovered the most efficient and\r\npractically sole cause of the origin of species, he carried the doctrine\r\nto its extreme limits, and after over twenty years of observation and\r\nexperiment along this single line, pushing entirely aside the\r\nErasmus-Darwin and Lamarckian factors of change of environment, though\r\noccasionally acknowledging the value of use and disuse, he triumphantly\r\nbroke over all opposition, and lived to see his doctrine generally\r\naccepted. He had besides the support of some of the strongest men in\r\nscience: Wallace in a twin paper advocated the same views; Spencer,\r\nLyell, Huxley, Hooker, Haeckel, Bates, Semper, Wyman, Gray, Leidy, and\r\nother representative men more or less endorsed Darwin's views, or at\r\nleast some form of evolution, and owing largely to their efforts in\r\nscientific circles and in the popular press, the doctrine of descent\r\nrapidly permeated every avenue of thought and became generally accepted.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the general doctrine of evolution thus proved, and the\r\n\"survival of the fittest\" an accomplished fact, the next step was to\r\nascertain \"how,\" as Cope asked, \"the fittest originated?\" It was felt by\r\nsome that natural selection alone was not adequate to explain the first\r\nsteps in the origin of genera, families, orders, classes, and branches\r\nor phyla. It was perceived by some that natural selection by itself was\r\nnot a _vera causa_, an efficient agent, but was passive, and rather\r\nexpressed the results of the operations of a series of factors. The\r\ntransforming should naturally precede the action of the selective\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nWe were, then, in our quest for the factors of organic evolution,\r\nobliged to fall back on the action of the physico-chemical forces such\r\nas light, or its absence, heat, cold, change of climate; and the\r\nphysiological agencies of food, or in other words on changes in the\r\nphysical environment, as well as in the biological environment. Lamarck\r\nwas the first one who, owing to his many years' training in systematic\r\nbotany and zoölogy, and his philosophic breadth, had stated more fully\r\nand authoritatively than any one else the results of changes in the\r\naction of the primary factors of evolution. Hence a return on the part\r\nof many in Europe, and especially in America, to Lamarckism or its\r\nmodern form, Neolamarckism. Lamarck had already, so far as he could\r\nwithout a knowledge of modern morphology, embryology, cytology, and\r\nhistology, suggested those fundamental principles of transformism on\r\nwhich rests the selective principle.\r\n\r\nHad his works been more accessible, or, where available, more carefully\r\nread, and his views more fairly represented; had he been favored in his\r\nlifetime by a single supporter, rather than been unjustly criticised by\r\nCuvier, science would have made more rapid progress, for it is an\r\naxiomatic truth that the general acceptance of a working evolutionary\r\ntheory has given a vast impetus to biology.\r\n\r\nWe will now give a brief historical summary of the history of opinion\r\nheld by Lamarckians regarding the causes of the \"origin of the fittest,\"\r\nthe rise of variations, and the appearance of a population of plant and\r\nanimal forms sufficiently extensive and differentiated to allow for the\r\nplay of the competitive forces, and of the more passive selective\r\nagencies which began to operate in pre-cambrian times, or as soon as the\r\nearth became fitted for the existence of living beings.\r\n\r\nThe first writer after Lamarck to work along the lines he laid down was\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer. In 1866-71, in his epochal and remarkably\r\nsuggestive _Principles of Biology_, the doctrine of use and disuse is\r\nimplicated in his statements as to the effects of motion on structure in\r\ngeneral;[204] and in his theory as to the origin of the notochord, and\r\nof the segmentation of the vertebral column and the segmental\r\narrangement of the muscles by muscular strains,[205] he laid the\r\nfoundations for future work along this line. He also drew attention in\r\nthe same work to the complementary development of parts, and likewise\r\ninstanced the decreased size of the jaws in the civilized races of\r\nmankind, as a change not accounted for by the natural selection of\r\nfavorable variations.[206] In fact, this work is largely based on the\r\nLamarckian principles, as affording the basis for the action of natural\r\nselection, and thirty years later we find him affirming: \"The direct\r\naction of the medium was the primordial factor of organic\r\nevolution.\"[207] In his well-known essay on \"The Inadequacy of Natural\r\nSelection\" (1893) the great philosopher, with his accustomed vigor and\r\nforce, criticises the arguments of those who rely too exclusively on\r\nDarwinism alone, and especially Neodarwinism, as a sufficient factor to\r\naccount for the origin of special structures as well as species.\r\n\r\nThe first German author to appreciate the value of the Lamarckian\r\nfactors was that fertile and comprehensive philosopher and investigator\r\nErnst Haeckel, who also harmonized Lamarckism and Darwinism in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n  \"We should, on account of the grand proofs just enumerated, have to\r\n  adopt Lamarck's Theory of Descent for the explanation of biological\r\n  phenomena, even if we did not possess Darwin's Theory of Selection.\r\n  The one is so completely and _directly proved_ by the other, and\r\n  established by mechanical causes, that there remains nothing to be\r\n  desired. The laws of _Inheritance_ and _Adaptation_ are universally\r\n  acknowledged physiological facts, the former traceable to\r\n  propagation, the latter to the _nutrition_ of organisms. On the\r\n  other hand, the _struggle for existence_ is a _biological_ fact,\r\n  which with mathematical necessity follows from the general\r\n  disproportion between the average number of organic individuals and\r\n  the numerical excess of their germs.\"[208]\r\n\r\nA number of American naturalists at about the same date, as the result\r\nof studies in different directions, unbiassed by a too firm belief in\r\nthe efficacy of natural selection, and relying on the inductive method\r\nalone, worked away at the evidence in favor of the primary factors of\r\nevolution along Lamarckian lines, though quite independently, for at\r\nfirst neither Hyatt nor Cope had read Lamarck's writings.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 Professor A. Hyatt published the first of a series of classic\r\nmemoirs on the genetic relations of the fossil cephalopods. His labors,\r\nso rich in results, have now been carried on for forty years, and are\r\nsupplemented by careful, prolonged work on the sponges, on the tertiary\r\nshells of Steinheim, and on the land shells of the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\nHis first paper was on the parallelism between the different stages of\r\nlife in the individual and those of the ammonites, carrying out\r\nD'Orbigny's discovery of embryonic, youthful, adult, and old-age stages\r\nin ammonites,[209] and showing that these forms are due to an\r\nacceleration of growth in the mature forms, and a retardation in the\r\nsenile forms.\r\n\r\nIn a memoir on the \"Biological Relations of the Jurassic\r\nAmmonites,\"[210] he assigns the causes of the progressive changes in\r\nthese forms, the origination of new genera, and the production of young,\r\nmature, and senile forms to \"the favorable nature of the physical\r\nsurroundings, primarily producing characteristic changes which become\r\nperpetuated and increased by inheritance within the group.\"\r\n\r\nThe study of the modifications of the tertiary forms of Planorbis at\r\nSteinheim, begun by Hilgendorf, led among others (nine in all) to the\r\nfollowing conclusions:\r\n\r\n  \"First, that the unsymmetrical spiral forms of the shells of these\r\n  and of all the Mollusca probably resulted from the action of the\r\n  laws of heredity, modified by gravitation.\r\n\r\n  \"Second, that there are many characteristics in these shells and in\r\n  other groups, which are due solely to the uniform action of the\r\n  physical influence of the immediate surroundings, varying with every\r\n  change of locality, but constant and uniform within each locality.\r\n\r\n  \"Third, that the Darwinian law of Natural Selection does not explain\r\n  these relations, but applies only to the first stages in the\r\n  establishment of the differences between forms or species in the\r\n  same locality. That its office is to fix these in the organization\r\n  and bring them within the reach of the laws of heredity.\"\r\n\r\nThese views we find reiterated in his later palæontological papers.\r\nHyatt's views on acceleration were adopted by Neumayr.[211] Waagen,[212]\r\nfrom his studies on the Jurassic cephalopods, concludes that the factors\r\nin the evolution of these forms were changes in external conditions,\r\ngeographical isolation, competition, and that the fundamental law was\r\nnot that of Darwin, but \"the law of development.\" Hyatt has also shown\r\nthat at first evolution was rapid. \"The evolution is a purely mechanical\r\nproblem in which the action of the habitat is the working agent of all\r\nthe major changes; first acting upon the adult stages, as a rule, and\r\nthen through heredity upon the earlier stages in successive\r\ngenerations.\" He also shows that as the primitive forms migrated and\r\noccupied new, before barren, areas, where they met with new conditions,\r\nthe organisms \"changed their habits and structures rapidly to accord\r\nwith these new conditions.\"[213]\r\n\r\nWhile the palæontological facts afford complete and abundant proofs of\r\nthe modifying action of changes in the environment, Hyatt, in 1877, from\r\nhis studies on sponges,[214] shows that the origin of their endless\r\nforms \"can only be explained by the action of physical surroundings\r\ndirectly working upon the organization and producing by such direct\r\naction the modifications or common variations above described.\"\r\n\r\nMr. A. Agassiz remarks that the effect of the nature of the bottom of\r\nthe sea on sponges and rhizopods \"is an all-important factor in\r\nmodifying the organism.\"[215]\r\n\r\nWhile Hyatt's studies were chiefly on the ammonites, molluscs, and\r\nexisting sponges, Cope was meanwhile at work on the batrachians. His\r\n_Origin of Genera_ appeared shortly after Hyatt's first paper, but in\r\nthe same year (1866). This was followed by a series of remarkably\r\nsuggestive essays based on his extensive palæontological work, which are\r\nin part reprinted in his _Origin of the Fittest_ (1887); while in his\r\nepoch-making book, _The Primary Factors of Organic Evolution_ (1896), we\r\nhave in a condensed shape a clear exposition of some of the Lamarckian\r\nfactors in their modern Neolamarckian form.\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction, p. 9, he remarks:\r\n\r\n  \"In these papers by Professor Hyatt and myself is found the first\r\n  attempt to show by concrete examples of natural taxonomy that the\r\n  variations that result in evolution are not multifarious or\r\n  promiscuous, but definite and direct, contrary to the method which\r\n  seeks no origin for variations other than natural selection. In\r\n  other words, these publications constitute the first essays in\r\n  systematic evolution that appeared. By the discovery of the\r\n  paleontologic succession of modifications of the articulations of\r\n  the vertebrate, and especially mammalian, skeleton, I first\r\n  furnished an actual demonstration of the reality of the Lamarckian\r\n  factor of use, or motion, as friction, impact, and strain, as an\r\n  efficient cause of evolution.\"[216]\r\n\r\nThe discussion in Cope's work of kinetogenesis, or of the effects of use\r\nand disuse, affords an extensive series of facts in support of these\r\nfactors of Lamarck's. As these two books are accessible to every one, we\r\nneed only refer the reader to them as storehouses of facts bearing on\r\nNeolamarckism.\r\n\r\nThe present writer, from a study of the development and anatomy of\r\nLimulus and of Arthropod ancestry, was early (1870)[217] led to adopt\r\nLamarckian views in preference to the theory of Natural Selection, which\r\nnever seemed to him adequate or sufficiently comprehensive to explain\r\nthe origin of variations.\r\n\r\nIn the following year,[218] from a study of the insects and other\r\nanimals of Mammoth Cave, we claimed that \"the characters separating the\r\ngenera and species of animals are those inherited from adults, modified\r\nby their physical surroundings and adaptations to changing conditions of\r\nlife, inducing certain alterations in parts which have been transmitted\r\nwith more or less rapidity, and become finally fixed and habitual.\"\r\n\r\nIn an essay entitled \"The Ancestry of Insects\"[219] (1873) we adopted\r\nthe Lamarckian factors of change of habits and environment, of use and\r\ndisuse, to account for the origin of the appendages, while we attributed\r\nthe origin of the metamorphoses of insects to change of habits or of the\r\ntemperature of the seasons and of climates, particularly the change in\r\nthe earth's climates from the earlier ages of the globe, \"when the\r\ntemperature of the earth was nearly the same the world over, to the\r\ntimes of the present distribution of heat and cold in zones.\"\r\n\r\nFrom further studies on cave animals, published in 1877,[220] we wrote\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  \"In the production of these cave species, the exceptional phenomena\r\n  of darkness, want of sufficient food, and unvarying temperature,\r\n  have been plainly enough _veræ causæ_. To say that the principle of\r\n  natural selection accounts for the change of structure is no\r\n  explanation of the phenomena; the phrase has to the mind of the\r\n  writer no meaning in connection with the production of these cave\r\n  forms, and has as little meaning in accounting for the origination\r\n  of species and genera in general. Darwin's phrase 'natural\r\n  selection,' or Herbert Spencer's term 'survival of the fittest,'\r\n  expresses simply the final result, while the process of the\r\n  origination of the new forms which have survived, or been selected\r\n  by nature, is to be explained by the action of the physical\r\n  environments of the animals coupled with inheritance-force. It has\r\n  always appeared to the writer that the phrases quoted above have\r\n  been misused to state the cause, when they simply express the result\r\n  of the action of a chain of causes which we may, with Herbert\r\n  Spencer, call the 'environment' of the organism undergoing\r\n  modification; and thus a form of Lamarckianism, greatly modified by\r\n  recent scientific discoveries, seems to meet most of the\r\n  difficulties which arise in accounting for the origination of\r\n  species and higher groups of organisms. Certainly 'natural\r\n  selection' or the 'survival of the fittest' is not a _vera causa_,\r\n  though the 'struggle for existence' may show us the causes which\r\n  have led to the _preservation_ of species, while changes in the\r\n  environment of the organism may satisfactorily account for the\r\n  original tendency to variation assumed by Mr. Darwin as the\r\n  starting-point where natural selection begins to act.\"\r\n\r\nIn our work on _The Cave Animals of North America_,[221] after stating\r\nthat Darwin in his _Origin of Species_ attributed the loss of eyes\r\n\"wholly to disuse,\" remarking (p. 142) that after the more or less\r\nperfect obliteration of the eyes, \"natural selection will often have\r\neffected other changes, such as an increase in the length of the antennæ\r\nor palpi, as a compensation for blindness,\" we then summed up as follows\r\nthe causes of the production of cave faunæ in general:\r\n\r\n  \"1. Change in environment from light, even partial, to twilight or\r\n  total darkness, and involving diminution of food, and compensation\r\n  for the loss of certain organs by the hypertrophy of others.\r\n\r\n  \"2. Disuse of certain organs.\r\n\r\n  \"3. Adaptation, enabling the more plastic forms to survive and\r\n  perpetuate their stock.\r\n\r\n  \"4. Isolation, preventing intercrossing with out-of-door forms,\r\n  thus insuring the permanency of the new varieties, species, or\r\n  genera.\r\n\r\n  \"5. Heredity, operating to secure for the future the permanence of\r\n  the newly originated forms as long as the physical conditions remain\r\n  the same.\r\n\r\n  \"Natural selection perhaps expresses the total result of the working\r\n  of these five factors rather than being an efficient cause in\r\n  itself, or at least constitutes the last term in a series of causes.\r\n  Hence Lamarckism in a modern form, or as we have termed it,\r\n  Neolamarckism, seems to us to be nearer the truth than Darwinism\r\n  proper or natural selection.\"[222]\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to apply Lamarck's principle of the origin of the spines\r\nand horns of caterpillars and other insects as well as other animals to\r\nthe result of external stimuli,[223] we had not then read what he says\r\non the subject. (See p. 316.) Having, however, been led to examine into\r\nthe matter, from the views held by recent observers, especially Henslow,\r\nand it appearing that Lamarck was substantially correct in supposing\r\nthat the blood (his \"fluids\") would flow to parts on the exposed\r\nportions of the body and thus cause the origin of horns, on the\r\nprinciple of the saying, \"_ubi irritatio, ibi affluxus_,\" we came to the\r\nfollowing conclusions:\r\n\r\n  \"The Lamarckian factors (1) change (both direct and indirect) in the\r\n  _milieu_, (2) need, and (3) habit, and the now generally adopted\r\n  principle that a change of function induces change in organs,[224]\r\n  and in some or many cases actually induces the hypertrophy and\r\n  specialization of what otherwise would be indifferent parts or\r\n  organs;--these factors are all-important in the evolution of the\r\n  colors, ornaments, and outgrowths from the cuticle of caterpillars.\"\r\n\r\nOur present views as to the relations between the Lamarckian factors and\r\nthe Darwinian one of natural selection are shown by the following\r\nsummary at the end of this essay.\r\n\r\n  \"1. The more prominent tubercles, and spines or bristles arising\r\n  from them, are hypertrophied piliferous warts, the warts, with the\r\n  seta or hair which they bear, being common to all caterpillars.\r\n\r\n  \"2. The hypertrophy or enlargement was probably [we should rather\r\n  say _possibly_] primarily due to a change of station from herbs to\r\n  trees, involving better air, a more equable temperature, perhaps a\r\n  different and better food.\r\n\r\n  \"3. The enlarged and specialized tubercles developed more rapidly on\r\n  certain segments than on others, especially the more prominent\r\n  segments, because the nutritive fluids would tend more freely to\r\n  supply parts most exposed to external stimuli.\r\n\r\n  \"4. The stimuli were in great part due to the visits of insects and\r\n  birds, resulting in a mimicry of the spines and projections on the\r\n  trees; the colors (lines and spots) were due to light or shade,\r\n  with the general result of protective mimicry, or adaptation to\r\n  tree-life.\r\n\r\n  \"5. As the result of some unknown factor some of the hypodermic\r\n  cells at the base of the spines became in certain forms specialized\r\n  so as to secrete a poisonous fluid.\r\n\r\n  \"6. After such primitive forms, members of different families, had\r\n  become established on trees, a process of arboreal segregation or\r\n  isolation would set in, and intercrossing with low-feeders would\r\n  cease.\r\n\r\n  \"7. Heredity, or the unknown factors of which heredity is the\r\n  result, would go on uninterruptedly, the result being a succession\r\n  of generations perfectly adapted to arboreal life.\r\n\r\n  \"8. Finally the conservative agency of natural selection operates\r\n  constantly, tending towards the preservation of the new varieties,\r\n  species, and genera, and would not cease to act, in a given\r\n  direction, so long as the environment remained the same.\r\n\r\n  \"9. Thus in order to account for the origin of a species, genus,\r\n  family, order, or even a class, the first steps, causing the\r\n  origination of variations, were in the beginning due to the primary\r\n  (direct and indirect) factors of evolution (Neolamarckism), and the\r\n  final stages were due to the secondary factors, segregation and\r\n  natural selection (Darwinism).\"\r\n\r\nFrom a late essay[225] we take the following extracts explaining our\r\nviews:\r\n\r\n  \"In seeking to explain the causes of a metamorphosis in animals, one\r\n  is compelled to go back to the primary factors of organic\r\n  evolution, such as the change of environment, whether the factors be\r\n  cosmical (gravity), physical changes in temperature, effects of\r\n  increased or diminished light and shade, under- or over-nutrition,\r\n  and the changes resulting from the presence or absence of enemies,\r\n  or from isolation. The action of these factors, whether direct or\r\n  indirect, is obvious, when we try to explain the origin or causes of\r\n  the more marked metamorphoses of animals. Then come in the other\r\n  Lamarckian factors of use and disuse, new needs resulting in new\r\n  modes of life, habits, or functions, which bring about the\r\n  origination, development, and perfection of new organs, as in new\r\n  species and genera, etc., or which in metamorphic forms may result\r\n  in a greater increase in the number of, and an exaggeration of the\r\n  features characterizing the stages of larval life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"VI. _The Adequacy of Neolamarckism_.\r\n\r\n  \"It is not to be denied that in many instances all through the\r\n  ceaseless operation of these fundamental factors there is going on a\r\n  process of sifting or of selection of forms best adapted to their\r\n  surroundings, and best fitted to survive, but this factor, though\r\n  important, is quite subordinate to the initial causes of variation,\r\n  and of metamorphic changes.\r\n\r\n  \"Neolamarckism,[226] as we understand this doctrine, has for its\r\n  foundation a combination of the factors suggested by the Buffon and\r\n  Geoffroy St. Hilaire school, which insisted on the direct action of\r\n  the _milieu_, and of Lamarck, who relied both on the direct (plants\r\n  and lowest animals) and on the indirect action of the environment,\r\n  adding the important factors of need and of change of habits\r\n  resulting either in the atrophy or in the development of organs by\r\n  disuse or use, with the addition of the hereditary transmission of\r\n  characters acquired in the lifetime of the individual.\r\n\r\n  \"Lamarck's views, owing to the early date of his work, which was\r\n  published in 1809, before the foundation of the sciences of\r\n  embryology, cytology, palæontology, zoögeography, and in short all\r\n  that distinguishes modern biology, were necessarily somewhat crude,\r\n  though the fundamental factors he suggested are those still invoked\r\n  by all thinkers of Lamarckian tendencies.\r\n\r\n  \"Neolamarckism gathers up and makes use of the factors both of the\r\n  St. Hilaire and Lamarckian schools, as containing the more\r\n  fundamental causes of variation, and adds those of geographical\r\n  isolation or segregation (Wagner and Gulick), the effects of\r\n  gravity, the effects of currents of air and of water, of fixed or\r\n  sedentary as opposed to active modes of life, the results of strains\r\n  and impacts (Ryder, Cope, and Osborn), the principle of change of\r\n  function as inducing the formation of new structures (Dohrn), the\r\n  effects of parasitism, commensalism, and of symbiosis--in short, the\r\n  biological environment; together with geological extinction, natural\r\n  and sexual selection, and hybridity.\r\n\r\n  \"It is to be observed that the Neolamarckian in relying mainly on\r\n  these factors does not overlook the value of natural selection as a\r\n  guiding principle, and which began to act as soon as the world\r\n  became stocked with the initial forms of life, but he simply seeks\r\n  to assign this principle to its proper position in the hierarchy of\r\n  factors.\r\n\r\n  \"Natural selection, as the writer from the first has insisted, is\r\n  not a _vera causa_, an initial or impelling cause in the origination\r\n  of new species and genera. It does not start the ball in motion; it\r\n  only, so to speak, guides its movements down this or that incline.\r\n  It is the expression, like that of \"the survival of the fittest\" of\r\n  Herbert Spencer, of the results of the combined operation of the\r\n  more fundamental factors. In certain cases we cannot see any room\r\n  for its action; in some others we cannot at present explain the\r\n  origin of species in any other way. Its action increased in\r\n  proportion as the world became more and more crowded with diverse\r\n  forms, and when the struggle for existence had become more unceasing\r\n  and intense. It certainly cannot account for the origination of the\r\n  different branches, classes, or orders of organized beings. It in\r\n  the main simply corresponds to artificial selection; in the latter\r\n  case, man selects forms already produced by domestication, the\r\n  latter affording sports and varieties due to change in the\r\n  surroundings, that is, soil, climate, food, and other physical\r\n  features, as well as education.\r\n\r\n  \"In the case also of heredity, which began to operate as soon as the\r\n  earliest life forms appeared, we have at the outset to invoke the\r\n  principle of the heredity of characters acquired during the lifetime\r\n  of lowest organisms.\r\n\r\n  \"Finally, it is noticeable that when one is overmastered by the\r\n  dogma of natural selection he is apt, perhaps unconsciously, to give\r\n  up all effort to work out the factors of evolution, or to seek to\r\n  work out this or that cause of variation. Trusting too implicitly to\r\n  the supposed _vera causa_, one may close his eyes to the effects of\r\n  change of environment or to the necessity of constant attempts to\r\n  discover the real cause of this or that variation, the reduction or\r\n  increase in size of this or that organ; or become insensible to the\r\n  value of experiments. Were the dogma of natural selection to become\r\n  universally accepted, further progress would cease, and biology\r\n  would tend to relapse into a stage of atrophy and degeneration. On\r\n  the other hand, a revival of Lamarckism in its modern form, and a\r\n  critical and doubting attitude towards natural selection as an\r\n  efficient cause, will keep alive discussion and investigation, and\r\n  especially, if resort be had to experimentation, will carry up to a\r\n  higher plane the status of philosophical biology.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough now the leader of the Neodarwinians, and fully assured of the\r\n\"all-sufficiency\" of natural selection, the veteran biologist Weismann,\r\nwhose earlier works were such epoch-making contributions to insect\r\nembryology, was, when active as an investigator, a strong advocate of\r\nthe Lamarckian factors. In his masterly work, _Studies in the Theory of\r\nDescent_[227] (1875), although accepting Darwin's principle of natural\r\nselection, he also relied on \"the transforming influence of direct\r\naction as upheld by Lamarck,\" although he adds, \"its extent cannot as\r\nyet be estimated with any certainty.\" He concluded from his studies in\r\nseasonal dimorphism, \"that differences of specific value can originate\r\nthrough the direct action of external conditions of life only.\" While\r\nconceding that sexual selection plays a very important part in the\r\nmarkings and coloring of butterflies, he adds \"that a change produced\r\ndirectly by climate may be still further increased by sexual selection.\"\r\nHe also inquired into the origin of variability, and held that it can be\r\nelucidated by seasonal dimorphism. He thus formulated the chief results\r\nof his investigations: \"A species is only caused to change through the\r\ninfluence of changing external conditions of life, this change being in\r\na fixed direction which entirely depends on the physical nature of the\r\nvarying organism, and is different in different species or even in the\r\ntwo sexes of the same species.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of changes of climate on variation has been studied to\r\nespecial advantage in North America, owing to its great extent, and to\r\nthe fact that its territory ranges from the polar to the tropical\r\nregions, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. As respects\r\nclimatic variation in birds, Professor Baird first took up the inquiry,\r\nwhich was greatly extended, with especial relation to the formation of\r\nlocal varieties, by Dr. J. A. Allen,[228] who was the first to ascertain\r\nby careful measurements, and by a study of the difference in plumage and\r\npelage of individuals inhabiting distant portions of a common habitat,\r\nthe variations due to climatic and local causes.\r\n\r\n\"That varieties,\" he says, \"may and do arise by the action of climatic\r\ninfluences, and pass on to become species; and that species become, in\r\nlike manner, differentiated into genera, is abundantly indicated by the\r\nfacts of geographical distribution, and the obvious relation of local\r\nforms to the conditions of environment. The present more or less\r\nunstable condition of the circumstances surrounding organic beings,\r\ntogether with the known mutations of climate our planet has undergone in\r\npast geological ages, point clearly to the agency of physical conditions\r\nas one of the chief factors in the evolution of new forms of life. So\r\nlong as the environing conditions remain stable, just so long will\r\npermanency of character be maintained; but let changes occur, however\r\ngradual or minute, and differentiations begin.\" He inclines to regard\r\nthe modifications as due rather to the direct action of the conditions\r\nof environment than to \"the round-about process of natural selection.\"\r\nHe also admits that change of habits and food, use and disuse, are\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of inquiry, though on far less complete data, was extended\r\nby the present writer[229] in 1873 to the moths, careful measurements of\r\ntwenty-five species of geometrid moths common to the Atlantic and\r\nPacific coasts of North America showing that there is an increase in\r\nsize and variation in shape of the wings, and in some cases in color, in\r\nthe Pacific Coast over Eastern or Atlantic Coast individuals of the same\r\nspecies, the differences being attributed to the action of climatic\r\ncauses. The same law holds good in the few Notodontian moths common to\r\nboth sides of our continent. Similar studies, the results depending on\r\ncareful measurements of many individuals, have recently been made by\r\nC. H. Eigenmann (1895-96), W. J. Moenkhaus (1896), and H. C. Bumpus\r\n(1896-98).\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Owen, Gaudry, Huxley, Kowalevsky, Cope, Marsh,\r\nFilhol, Osborn, Scott, Wortmann, and many others, abundantly prove that\r\nthe lines of vertebrate descent must have been the result of the action\r\nof the primary factors of organic evolution, including the principles of\r\nmigration, isolation, and competition; the selective principle being\r\nsecondary and preservative rather than originative.\r\n\r\nImportant contributions to dynamic evolution or kinetogenesis are the\r\nessays of Cope, Ryder, Dall, Osborn, Jackson, Scott, and Wortmann.\r\n\r\nRyder began in 1877 to publish a series of remarkably suggestive essays\r\non the \"mechanical genesis,\" through strains, of the vertebrate limbs\r\nand teeth, including the causes of the reduction of digits. In\r\ndiscussing the origin of the great development of the incisor teeth of\r\nrodents, he suggested that \"the more severe strains to which they were\r\nsubjected by enforced or intelligently assumed changes of habit, were\r\nthe initiatory agents in causing them to assume their present forms,\r\nsuch forms as were best adapted to resist the greatest strains without\r\nbreaking.\"[230]\r\n\r\nHe afterwards[231] claimed that the articulations of the cartilaginous\r\nfin-rays of the trout (_Salmo fontinalis_) are due to the mechanical\r\nstrains experienced by the rays in use as motors of the body of the fish\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\nIn the line of inquiry opened up by Cope and by Ryder are the essays of\r\nOsborn[232] on the mechanical causes for the displacement of the\r\nelements of the feet in the mammals, and the phylogeny of the teeth.\r\nAlso Professor W. B. Scott thus expresses the results of his\r\nstudies:[233]\r\n\r\n  \"To sum up the results of our examination of certain series of\r\n  fossil mammals, one sees clearly that transformation, whether in the\r\n  way of the addition of new parts or the reduction of those already\r\n  present, acts just _as if_ the direct action of the environment and\r\n  the habits of the animal were the efficient cause of the change, and\r\n  any explanation which excludes the direct action of such agencies is\r\n  confronted by the difficulty of an immense number of the most\r\n  striking coincidences.... So far as I can see, the theory of\r\n  determinate variations and of use-inheritance is not antagonistic\r\n  but supplementary to natural selection, the latter theory attempting\r\n  no explanation of the _causes_ of variation. Nor is it pretended for\r\n  a moment that use and disuse are the sole or even the chief factors\r\n  in variation.\"\r\n\r\nAs early as 1868 the Lamarckian factor of isolation, due to migration\r\ninto new regions, was greatly extended, and shown by Moritz Wagner[234]\r\nto be a most important agent in the limitation and fixation of varieties\r\nand species.\r\n\r\n  \"Darwin's work,\" he says, \"neither satisfactorily explains the\r\n  external cause which gives the first impulse to increased individual\r\n  variability, and consequently to natural selection, nor that\r\n  condition which, in connection with a certain advantage in the\r\n  struggle for life, renders the new characteristics indispensable.\r\n  The latter is, according to my conviction, solely fulfilled by the\r\n  voluntary or passive migration of organisms and colonization, which\r\n  depends in a great measure upon the configuration of the country; so\r\n  that only under favorable conditions would the home of a new species\r\n  be founded.\"\r\n\r\nThis was succeeded by Rev. J. T. Gulick's profound essays \"On Diversity\r\nof Evolution under One Set of External Conditions\"[235] (1872), and on\r\n\"Divergent Evolution through Cumulative Segregation\"[236] (1887).\r\n\r\nThese and later papers are based on his studies on the land shells of\r\nthe Hawaiian Islands. The cause of their extreme diversity of local\r\nspecies is, he claims, not due to climatic conditions, food, enemies, or\r\nto natural selection, but to the action of what he calls the \"law of\r\nsegregation.\"\r\n\r\nFifteen years later Mr. Romanes published his theory of physiological\r\nselection, which covered much the same ground.\r\n\r\nA very strong little book by an ornithologist of wide experience,\r\nCharles Dixon,[237] and refreshing to read, since it is packed with\r\nfacts, is Lamarckian throughout. The chief factor in the formation of\r\nlocal species is, he thinks, isolation; the others are climatic\r\ninfluences (especially the glacial period), use and disuse, and sexual\r\nselection as well as chemical agency. Dixon insists on the \"vast\r\nimportance of isolation in the modification of many forms of life,\r\nwithout the assistance of natural selection.\" Again he says: \"Natural\r\nselection, as has often been remarked, can only preserve a beneficial\r\nvariation--it cannot originate it, it is not a cause of variation; on\r\nthe other hand, the use or disuse of organs is a direct cause of\r\nvariation, and can furnish natural selection with abundance of material\r\nto work upon\" (p. 49). The book, like the papers of Allen, Ridgway,\r\nGulick, and others, shows the value of isolation or segregation in\r\nspecial areas as a factor in the origination of varieties and species,\r\nthe result being the prevention of interbreeding, which would otherwise\r\nswamp the incipient varieties.\r\n\r\nHere might be cited Delboeuf's law:[238]\r\n\r\n  \"When a modification is produced in a very small number of\r\n  individuals, this modification, even were it advantageous, would be\r\n  destroyed by heredity, as the favored individuals would be obliged\r\n  to unite with the unmodified individuals. _Il n'en est rien,\r\n  cependant._ However great may be the number of forms similar to it,\r\n  and however small may be the number of dissimilar individuals which\r\n  would give rise to an isolated individual, we can always, while\r\n  admitting that the different generations are propagated under the\r\n  same conditions, meet with a number of generations at the end of\r\n  which the sum total of the modified individuals will surpass that of\r\n  the unmodified individuals.\" Giard adds that this law is capable of\r\n  mathematical demonstration. \"Thus the continuity or even the\r\n  periodicity of action of a primary factor, such, for example, as a\r\n  variation of the _milieu_, shows us the necessary and sufficient\r\n  condition under which a variety or species originates without the\r\n  aid of any secondary factor.\"\r\n\r\nSemper,[239] an eminent zoölogist and morphologist, who also was the\r\nfirst (in 1863) to criticise Darwin's theory of the mode of formation of\r\ncoral atolls, though not referring to Lamarck, published a strong,\r\ncatholic, and original book, which is in general essentially Lamarckian,\r\nwhile not undervaluing Darwin's principle of natural selection. \"It\r\nappears to me,\" he says, in the preface, \"that of all the properties of\r\nthe animal organism, Variability is that which may first and most easily\r\nbe traced by exact investigation to its efficient causes.\"\r\n\r\n  \"By a rearrangement of the materials of his argument, however, we\r\n  obtain, as I conceive, convincing proof that external conditions can\r\n  exert not only a very powerful selective force, but a transforming\r\n  one as well, although it must be the more limited of the two.\r\n\r\n  \"An organ no longer needed for its original purpose may adapt itself\r\n  to the altered circumstances, and alter correspondingly if it\r\n  contains within itself, as I have explained above, the elements of\r\n  such a change. Then the influence exerted by the changed conditions\r\n  will be _transforming_, not _selective_.\r\n\r\n  \"This last view may seem somewhat bold to those readers who know\r\n  that Darwin, in his theory of selection, has almost entirely set\r\n  aside the direct transforming influence of external circumstances.\r\n  Yet he seems latterly to be disposed to admit that he had\r\n  undervalued the transforming as well as the selective influence of\r\n  external conditions; and it seems to me that his objection to the\r\n  idea of such an influence rested essentially on the method of his\r\n  argument, which seemed indispensable for setting his theory of\r\n  selection and his hypothesis as to the transformation of species in\r\n  a clear light and on a firm footing\" (p. 37).\r\n\r\nDr. H. de Varigny has carried on much farther the kind of experiments\r\nbegun by Semper. In his _Experimental Evolution_ he employs the\r\nLamarckian factors of environment and use and disuse, regarding the\r\nselective factors as secondary.\r\n\r\nThe Lamarckian factors are also depended upon by the late Professor\r\nEimer in his works on the variation of the wall-lizard and on the\r\nmarkings of birds and mammals (1881-88), his final views being comprised\r\nin his general work.[240] The essence of his point of view may be seen\r\nby the following quotation:\r\n\r\n  \"According to my conception, the physical and chemical changes which\r\n  organisms experience during life through the action of the\r\n  environment, through light or want of light, air, warmth, cold,\r\n  water, moisture, food, etc., and which they transmit by heredity,\r\n  are the primary elements in the production of the manifold variety\r\n  of the organic world, and in the origin of species. From the\r\n  materials thus supplied the struggle for existence makes its\r\n  selection. These changes, however, express themselves simply as\r\n  growth\" (p. 22).\r\n\r\nIn a later paper[241] Eimer proposes the term \"orthogenesis,\" or direct\r\ndevelopment, in rigorous conformity to law, in a few definite\r\ndirections. Although this is simply and wholly Lamarckism, Eimer claims\r\nthat it is not, \"for,\" he strangely enough says, \"Lamarck ascribed no\r\nefficiency whatever to the effects of outward influences on the animal\r\nbody, and very little to their effects upon vegetable organisms.\"\r\nWhereas if he had read his Lamarck carefully, he would have seen that\r\nthe French evolutionist distinctly states that the environment acts\r\ndirectly on plants and the lower animals, but indirectly on those\r\nanimals with a brain, meaning the higher vertebrates. The same\r\nanti-selection views are held by Eimer's pupil, Piepers,[242] who\r\nexplains organic evolution by \"laws of growth, ... uncontrolled by any\r\nprocess of selection.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Cunningham likewise, in the preface to his translation of Eimer's\r\nwork, gives his reasons for adopting Neolamarckian views, concluding\r\nthat \"the theory of selection can never get over the difficulty of the\r\norigin of entirely new characters;\" that \"selection, whether natural or\r\nartificial, could not be the essential cause of the evolution of\r\norganisms.\" In an article on \"The New Darwinism\" (_Westminster Review_,\r\nJuly, 1891) he claims that Weismann's theory of heredity does not\r\nexplain the origin of horns, venomous teeth, feathers, wings of insects,\r\nor mammary glands, phosphorescent organs, etc., which have arisen on\r\nanimals whose ancestors never had anything similar.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the origin of whales and other aquatic mammals, W. Kükenthal\r\nsuggests that the modifications are partially attributable to mechanical\r\nprinciples. (_Annals and Mag. Nat. Hist._, February, 1891.)\r\n\r\nFrom his studies on the variation of butterflies, Karl Jordan[243]\r\nproposes the term \"mechanical selection\" to account for them, but he\r\npoints out that this factor can only work on variations produced by\r\nother factors. Certain cases, as the similar variation in the same\r\nlocality of two species of different families, but with the same wing\r\npattern, tell in favor of the direct action of the local surroundings on\r\nthe markings of the wings.\r\n\r\nIn the same direction are the essays of Schroeder[244] on the markings\r\nof caterpillars, which he ascribes to the colors of the surroundings; of\r\nFischer[245] on the transmutations of butterflies as the result of\r\nchanges of temperature, and also Dormeister's[246] earlier paper.\r\nSteinach[247] attributes the color of the lower vertebrates to the\r\ndirect influence of the light on the pigment cells, as does\r\nBiedermann.[248]\r\n\r\nIn his address on evolution and the factors of evolution, Professor A.\r\nGiard[249] has given due credit to Lamarck as \"the creator of\r\ntransformism,\" and to the position to be assigned to natural selection\r\nas a secondary factor. He quotes at length Lamarck's views published in\r\n1806. After enumerating the primary factors of organic evolution, he\r\nplaces natural selection among his secondary factors, such as heredity,\r\nsegregation, amixia, etc. On the other hand, he states that Lamarck was\r\nnot happy in the choice of the examples which he gave to explain the\r\naction of habits and use of parts. \"Je ne rappellerai par l'histoire\r\ntant de fois critique du cou de la giraffe et des cornes de l'escargot.\"\r\n\r\nAnother important factor in the evolution of the metazoa or many-celled\r\nanimals, from the sponges and polyps upward from the one-celled forms or\r\nprotozoa, is the principle of animal aggregation or colonization\r\nadvanced by Professor Perrier. As civilization and progressive\r\nintelligence in mankind arose from the aggregation of men into tribes or\r\npeoples which lived a sedentary life, so the agricultural, building, and\r\nother arts forthwith sprang up; and as the social insects owe their\r\nhigher degree of intelligence to their colonial mode of life, so as soon\r\nas unicellular organisms began to become fixed, and form aggregates, the\r\nsponge and polyp types of organization resulted, this leading to the\r\ngastræa, or ancestral form from which all the higher phyla may have\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nM. Perrier appears to fully accept Lamarck's views, including his\r\nspeculations as to wants, and use and disuse. He, however, refuses to\r\naccept Lamarck's extreme view as to the origin through effort of\r\nentirely new organs. As he says: \"Unfortunately, if Lamarck succeeded in\r\nexplaining in a plausible way the modification of organs already\r\nexisting, their adaptation to different uses, or even their\r\ndisappearance from disuse, in regard to the appearance of new organs he\r\nmade hypotheses so venturesome that they led to the momentary\r\nforgetfulness of his other forceful conceptions.\"[250]\r\n\r\nThe popular idea of Lamarckism, and which from the first has been\r\nprejudicial to his views, is that an animal may acquire an organ by\r\nsimply wishing for or desiring it, or, as his French critics put it, \"Un\r\nanimal finit toujours par posséder un organe quand il le veut.\" \"Such,\"\r\nsays Perrier,[251] \"is not the idea of Lamarck, who simply attributes\r\nthe transformations of species to the stimulating action of external\r\nconditions, construing it under the expression of wants (_besoins_), and\r\nexplaining by that word what we now call _adaptations_. Thus the long\r\nneck of the giraffe results from the fact that the animal inhabits a\r\ncountry where the foliage is situated at the tops of high trees; the\r\nlong legs of the wading birds have originated from the fact that these\r\nbirds are obliged to seek their food in the water without wetting\r\nthemselves,\" etc. (See p. 350.)\r\n\r\n  \"Many cases,\" says Perrier, \"may be added to-day to those which\r\n  Lamarck has cited to support his first law [pp. 303, 346]; the only\r\n  point which is open to discussion is the extent of the changes which\r\n  an organ may undergo, through the use it is put to by the animal. It\r\n  is a simple question of measurement. The possibility of the creation\r\n  of an organ in consequence of external stimuli is itself a matter\r\n  which deserves to be studied, and which we have no right to reject\r\n  without investigation, without observations, or to treat as a\r\n  ridiculous dream; Lamarck would doubtless have made it more readily\r\n  accepted, if he had not thought it well to pass over the\r\n  intermediate steps by means of wants. It is incontestable that by\r\n  lack of exercise organs atrophy and disappear.\"\r\n\r\n  Finally, says Perrier: \"Without doubt the real mechanism of the\r\n  improvement (_perfectionnement_) of organisms has escaped him\r\n  [Lamarck], but neither has Darwin explained it. The law of natural\r\n  selection is not the indication of a process of transformation of\r\n  animals; it is the expression of the total results. It states these\r\n  results without showing us how they have been brought about. We\r\n  indeed see that it tends to the preservation of the most perfect\r\n  organisms; but Darwin does not show us how the organisms themselves\r\n  originated. This is a void which we have only during these later\r\n  years tried to fill\" (p. 90).\r\n\r\nDr. J. A. Jeffries, author of an essay \"On the Epidermal System of\r\nBirds,\" in a later paper[252] thus frankly expresses his views as to the\r\nrelations of natural selection to the Lamarckian factors. Referring to\r\nDarwin's case of the leg bones of domestic ducks compared with those of\r\nwild ducks, and the atrophy of disused organs, he adds:\r\n\r\n  \"In this case, as with most of Lamarck's laws, Darwin has taken them\r\n  to himself wherever natural selection, sexual selection, and the\r\n  like have fallen to the ground.\r\n\r\n  \"Darwin's natural selection does not depend, as is popularly\r\n  supposed, on direct proof, but is adduced as an hypothesis which\r\n  gains its strength from being compatible with so many facts of\r\n  correlation between an organism and its surroundings. Yet the same\r\n  writer who considers natural selection proved will call for positive\r\n  experimental proof of Lamarck's theory, and refuse to accept its\r\n  general compatibility with the facts as support. Almost any case\r\n  where natural selection is held to act by virtue of advantage gained\r\n  by use of a part is equally compatible with Lamarck's theory of use\r\n  and development. The wings of birds of great power of flight, the\r\n  relations of insects to flowers, the claws of beasts of prey, are\r\n  all cases in point.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor J. A. Thomson's useful _Synthetic Summary of the Influence of\r\nthe Environment upon the Organism_ (1887) takes for its text Spencer's\r\naphorism, that the direct action of the medium was the primordial factor\r\nof organic evolution. Professor Geddes relies on the changes in the soil\r\nand climate to account for the origin of spines in plants.\r\n\r\nThe botanist Sachs, in his _Physiology of Plants_ (1887), remarks: \"A\r\nfar greater portion of the phenomena of life are [is] called forth by\r\nexternal influences than one formerly ventured to assume.\"\r\n\r\nCertain botanists are now strong in the belief that the species of\r\nplants have originated through the direct influence of the environment.\r\nOf these the most outspoken is the Rev. Professor G. Henslow. His view\r\nis that self-adaptation, by response to the definite action of changed\r\nconditions of life, is the true origin of species. In 1894[253] he\r\ninsisted, \"_in the strictest sense of the term_, that natural selection\r\nis not wanted as an 'aid' or a 'means' in originating species.\" In a\r\nlater paper[254] he reasserts that all variations are definite, that\r\nthere are no indefinite variations, and that natural selection \"can take\r\nno part in the origination of varieties.\" He quotes with approval the\r\nconclusion of Mr. Herbert Spencer in 1852, published\r\n\r\n  \"seven years before Darwin and Dr. Wallace superadded natural\r\n  selection as an aid in the origin of species. He saw no necessity\r\n  for anything beyond the natural power of change with adaptation; and\r\n  I venture now to add my own testimony, based upon upwards of a\r\n  quarter of a century's observations and experiments, which have\r\n  convinced me that Mr. Spencer was right and Darwin was wrong. His\r\n  words are as follows: 'The supporters of the development hypothesis\r\n  can show ... that any existing species, animal or vegetable, when\r\n  placed under conditions different from its previous ones,\r\n  immediately begins to undergo certain changes of structure fitting\r\n  it for the new conditions; ... that in the successive generations\r\n  these changes continue until ultimately the new conditions become\r\n  the natural ones.... They can show that throughout all organic\r\n  nature there is at work a modifying influence of the kind they\r\n  assign as the causes of specific differences; an influence which,\r\n  though slow in its action, does in time, if the circumstances demand\r\n  it, produce marked changes.'\"[255]\r\n\r\nMr. Henslow adduces observations and experiments by Buckman, Bailey,\r\nLesage, Lothelier, Costantin, Bonnier, and others, all demonstrating\r\nthat the environment acts directly on the plant.\r\n\r\nHenslow also suggests that endogens have originated from exogenous\r\nplants through self-adaptation to an aquatic habit,[256] which is in\r\nline with our idea that certain classes of animals have diverged from\r\nthe more primitive ones by change of habit, although this has led to the\r\ndevelopment of new class-characteristics by use and disuse, phenomena\r\nwhich naturally do not operate in plants, owing to their fixed\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nOther botanists--French, German, and English--have also been led to\r\nbelieve in the direct influence of the _milieu_, or environment. Such\r\nare Viet,[257] and Scott Elliot,[258] who attributes the growth of bulbs\r\nto the \"direct influence of the climate.\"\r\n\r\nIn a recent work Costantin[259] shares the belief emphatically held by\r\nsome German botanists in the direct influence of the environment not\r\nonly as modifying the form, but also as impressing, without the aid of\r\nnatural selection, that form on the species or part of its inherited\r\nstock; and one chapter is devoted to an attempt to establish the thesis\r\nthat acquired characters are inherited.\r\n\r\nIn his essay \"On Dynamic Influences in Evolution\" W. H. Dall[260] holds\r\nthe view that--\r\n\r\n  \"The environment stands in a relation to the individual such as the\r\n  hammer and anvil bear to the blacksmith's hot iron. The organism\r\n  suffers during its entire existence a continuous series of\r\n  mechanical impacts, none the less real because invisible, or\r\n  disguised by the fact that some of them are precipitated by\r\n  voluntary effort of the individual itself.... It is probable that\r\n  since the initiation of life upon the planet no two organisms have\r\n  ever been subjected to exactly the same dynamic influences during\r\n  their development.... The reactions of the organism against the\r\n  physical forces and mechanical properties of its environment are\r\n  abundantly sufficient, if we are granted a single organism, with a\r\n  tendency to grow, to begin with; time for the operation of the\r\n  forces; and the principle of the survival of the fittest.\"\r\n\r\nIn his paper on the hinge of Pelecypod molluscs and its development, he\r\nhas pointed out a number of the particular ways in which the dynamics of\r\nthe environment may act on the characters of the hinge and shell of\r\nbivalve molluscs. He has also shown that the initiation and development\r\nof the columellar plaits in Voluta, Mitra, and other gasteropod molluscs\r\n\"are the necessary mechanical result of certain comparatively simple\r\nphysical conditions; and that the variations and peculiarities connected\r\nwith these plaits perfectly harmonize with the results which follow\r\nwithin organic material subjected to analogous stresses.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same line of study is Dr. R. T. Jackson's[261] work on the\r\nmechanical origin of characters in the lamellibranch molluscs. \"The\r\nbivalve nature of the shell doubtless arose,\" he says, \"from the\r\nsplitting on the median line of a primitive univalvular ancestor;\" and\r\nhe adds: \"A parallel case is seen in the development of a bivalve shell\r\nin ancient crustaceans;\" in both types of shells \"the form is induced by\r\nthe mechanical conditions of the case.\" The adductor muscles of bivalve\r\nmolluscs and crustaceans are, he shows plainly, the necessary\r\nconsequence of the bivalvular condition.\r\n\r\nIn his theory as to the origin of the siphon of the clam (_Mya\r\narenaria_), he explains it in a manner identical with Lamarck's\r\nexplanations of the origin of the wading and swimming birds, etc., even\r\nto the use of the words \"effort\" and \"habit.\"\r\n\r\n  \"In _Mya arenaria_ we find a highly elongated siphon. In the young\r\n  the siphon hardly extends beyond the borders of the valves, and then\r\n  the animal lives at or close to the surface. In progressive growth,\r\n  as the animal burrows deeper, the siphon elongates, until it attains\r\n  a length many times the total length of the valves.\r\n\r\n  \"The ontogeny of the individual and the paleontology of the family\r\n  both show that Mya came from a form with a very abbreviated siphon,\r\n  and it seems evident that the long siphon of this genus was brought\r\n  about by the effort to reach the surface induced by the habit of\r\n  deep burial.\"\r\n\r\n  \"The tendency to equalize the form of growth in a horizontal plane,\r\n  or the geomalic tendency of Professor Hyatt,[262] is seen markedly\r\n  in pelecypods. In forms which crawl on the free borders of the\r\n  valves, the right and left growth in relation to the perpendicular\r\n  is obvious, and agrees with the right and left sides of the animal.\r\n  In Pecten the animal at rest lies on the right valve, and swims or\r\n  flies with the right valve lowermost. Here equalization to the right\r\n  and left of the perpendicular line passing through the centre of\r\n  gravity is very marked (especially in the Vola division of the\r\n  group); but the induced right and left aspect corresponds to the\r\n  dorsal and ventral sides of the animal, not the right and left\r\n  sides, as in the former case. Lima, a near ally of Pecten, swims\r\n  with the edges of the valves perpendicular. In this case the\r\n  geomalic growth corresponds to the right and left sides of the\r\n  animal.\r\n\r\n  \"The oyster has a deep or spoon-shaped attached valve, and a flat or\r\n  flatter free valve. This form, or a modification of it, we find to\r\n  be characteristic of all pelecypods which are attached to a foreign\r\n  object of support by the cementation of one valve. All are highly\r\n  modified, and are strikingly different from the normal form seen in\r\n  locomotive types of the group. The oyster may be taken as the type\r\n  of the form adopted by attached pelecypods. The two valves are\r\n  unequal, the attached valve being concave, the free valve flat; but\r\n  they are not only unequal, they are often very dissimilar--as\r\n  different as if they belonged to a distinct type in what would be\r\n  considered typical forms. This is remarkable as a case of acquired\r\n  and inherited characteristics finding very different expression in\r\n  the two valves of a group belonging to a class typically\r\n  equivalvular. The attached valve is the most highly modified, and\r\n  the free is least modified, retaining more fully ancestral\r\n  characters. Therefore, it is to the free young before fixation takes\r\n  place and to the free, least-modified valve that we must turn in\r\n  tracing genetic relations of attached groups. Another characteristic\r\n  of attached pelecypods is camerated structure, which is most\r\n  frequent and extensive in the thick attached valve. The form as\r\n  above described is characteristic of the Ostreidæ, Hinnites,\r\n  Spondylus, and Plicatula, Dimya, Pernostrea, Aetheria, and Mulleria;\r\n  and Chama and its near allies. These various genera, though\r\n  ostreiform in the adult, are equivalvular and of totally different\r\n  form in the free young. The several types cited are from widely\r\n  separated families of pelecypods, yet all, under the same given\r\n  conditions, adopt a closely similar form, which is strong proof that\r\n  common forces acting on all alike have induced the resulting form.\r\n  What the forces are that have induced this form it is not easy to\r\n  see from the study of this form alone; but the ostrean form is the\r\n  base of a series, from the summit of which we get a clearer view.\"\r\n  (_Amer. Nat._, pp. 18-20.)\r\n\r\nHere we see, plainly brought out by Jackson's researches, that the\r\nLamarckian factors of change of environment and consequently of habit,\r\neffort, use and disuse, or mechanical strains resulting in the\r\nmodifications of some, and even the appearance of new organs, as the\r\nadductor muscles, have originated new characters which are peculiar to\r\nthe class, and thus a new class has been originated. The mollusca,\r\nindeed, show to an unusual extent the influence of a change in\r\nenvironment and of use and disuse in the formation of classes.\r\n\r\nLang's treatment, in his _Text-book of Comparative Anatomy_ (1888), of\r\nthe subjects of the musculature of worms and crustacea, and of the\r\nmechanism of the motion of the segmented body in the Arthropoda, is of\r\nmuch value in relation to the mechanical genesis of the body segments\r\nand limbs of the members of this type. Dr. B. Sharp has also discussed\r\nthe same subject (_American Naturalist_, 1893, p. 89), also Graber in\r\nhis works, while the present writer in his _Text-book of Entomology_\r\n(1898) has attempted to treat of the mechanical origin of the segments\r\nof insects, and of the limbs and their jointed structure, along the\r\nlines laid down by Herbert Spencer, Lang, Sharp, and Graber.\r\n\r\nW. Roux[263] has inquired how natural selection could have determined\r\nthe special orientation of the sheets of spongy tissue of bone. He\r\ncontends that the selection of accidental variation could not originate\r\nspecies, because such variations are isolated, and because, to\r\nconstitute a real advantage, they should rest on several characters\r\ntaken together. His example is the transformation of aquatic into\r\nterrestrial animals.\r\n\r\nG. Pfeffer[264] opposes the efficacy of natural selection, as do C.\r\nEmery[265] and O. Hertwig. The essence of Hertwig's _The Biological\r\nProblem of To-day_ (1894) is that \"in obedience to different external\r\ninfluences the same rudiments may give rise to different adult\r\nstructures\" (p. 128). Delage, in his _Théories sur l'Hérédité_,\r\nsummarizes under seven heads the objections of these distinguished\r\nbiologists. Species arise, he says, from general variations, due to\r\nchange in the conditions of life, such as food, climate, use and disuse,\r\nvery rarely individual variations, such as sports or aberrations, which\r\nare more or less the result of disease.\r\n\r\nMention should also be made of the essays and works of H. Driesch,[266]\r\nDe Varigny,[267] Danilewsky,[268] Verworn,[269] Davenport,[270]\r\nGadow,[271] and others.\r\n\r\nIn his address on \"Neodarwinism and Neolamarckism,\" Mr. Lester F. Ward,\r\nthe palæobotanist, says:\r\n\r\n  \"I shall be obliged to confine myself almost exclusively to the one\r\n  great mind, who far more than all others combined paved the way for\r\n  the new science of biology to be founded by Darwin, namely,\r\n  Lamarck.\" After showing that Lamarck established the functional, or\r\n  what we would call the dynamic factors, he goes on to say that\r\n  \"Lamarck, although he clearly grasped the law of competition, or the\r\n  struggle for existence, the law of adaptation, or the correspondence\r\n  of the organism to the changing environment, the transmutation of\r\n  species, and the genealogical descent of all organic beings, the\r\n  more complex from the more simple; he nevertheless failed to\r\n  conceive the selective principle as formulated by Darwin and\r\n  Wallace, which so admirably complemented these great laws.\"[272]\r\n\r\nAs is well known, Huxley was, if we understand his expressions aright,\r\nnot fully convinced of the entire adequacy of natural selection.\r\n\r\n  \"There is no fault to be found with Mr. Darwin's method, then; but\r\n  it is another question whether he has fulfilled all the conditions\r\n  imposed by that method. Is it satisfactorily proved, in fact, that\r\n  species may be originated by selection? that there is such a thing\r\n  as natural selection? that none of the phenomena exhibited by\r\n  species are inconsistent with the origin of species in this way?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"After much consideration, with assuredly no bias against\r\n  Mr. Darwin's views, it is our clear conviction that, as the evidence\r\n  stands, it is not absolutely proven that a group of animals, having\r\n  all the characters exhibited by species in nature, has ever been\r\n  originated by selection, whether artificial or natural. Groups\r\n  having the morphological character of species, distinct and\r\n  permanent races, in fact, have been so produced over and over again;\r\n  but there is no positive evidence, at present, that any group of\r\n  animals has, by variation and selective breeding, given rise to\r\n  another group which was even in the least degree infertile with the\r\n  first. Mr. Darwin is perfectly aware of this weak point, and brings\r\n  forward a multitude of ingenious and important arguments to diminish\r\n  the force of the objection.\"[273]\r\n\r\nWe have cited the foregoing conclusions and opinions of upwards of forty\r\nworking biologists, many of whom were brought up, so to speak, in the\r\nDarwinian faith, to show that the pendulum of evolutionary thought is\r\nswinging away from the narrow and restricted conception of natural\r\nselection, pure and simple, as the sole or most important factor, and\r\nreturning in the direction of Lamarckism.\r\n\r\nWe may venture to say of Lamarck what Huxley once said of Descartes,\r\nthat he expressed \"the thoughts which will be everybody's two or three\r\ncenturies after\" him. Only the change of belief, due to the rapid\r\naccumulation of observed facts, has come in a period shorter than \"two\r\nor three centuries;\" for, at the end of the very century in which\r\nLamarck, whatever his crudities, vagueness, and lack of observations and\r\nexperiments, published his views, wherein are laid the foundations on\r\nwhich natural selection rests, the consensus of opinion as to the direct\r\nand indirect influence of the environment, and the inadequacy of natural\r\nselection as an initial factor, was becoming stronger and deeper-rooted\r\neach year.\r\n\r\nWe must never forget or underestimate, however, the inestimable value of\r\nthe services rendered by Darwin, who by his patience, industry, and rare\r\ngenius for observation and experiment, and his powers of lucid\r\nexposition, convinced the world of the truth of evolution, with the\r\nresult that it has transformed the philosophy of our day. We are all of\r\nus evolutionists, though we may differ as to the nature of the efficient\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[204] Vol. ii., p. 167, 1871.\r\n\r\n[205] Vol. ii., p. 195.\r\n\r\n[206] Vol. i., § 166, p. 456.\r\n\r\n[207] _The Factors of Organic Evolution_, 1895, p. 460.\r\n\r\n[208] _Schöpfungegeschichte_, 1868. _The History of Creation_, New York,\r\nii., p. 355.\r\n\r\n[209] Alcide d'Orbigny, _Paléontologie française_, Paris, 1840-59.\r\n\r\n[210] Abstract in Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History,\r\nxvii., December 16, 1874.\r\n\r\n[211] _Zeitschr. der deutsch. geol.

We may add\r\nthat the briefer form, Neolamarckism, is the more preferable.\r\n\r\n\"In the United States a number of naturalists have advocated what may be\r\ncalled Neo-Lamarckian views of evolution, especially the conception that\r\nin some cases rapid evolution may occur. The present writer, contrary to\r\npure Darwinians, believes that many species, but more especially types\r\nof genera and families, have been produced by changes in the environment\r\nacting often with more or less rapidity on the organism, resulting at\r\ntimes in a new genus, or even a family type. Natural selection, acting\r\nthrough thousands, and sometimes millions, of generations of animals and\r\nplants, often operates too slowly; there are gaps which have been, so to\r\nspeak, intentionally left by Nature. Moreover, natural selection was, as\r\nused by some writers, more an idea than a _vera causa_. Natural\r\nselection also begins with the assumption of a tendency to variation,\r\nand presupposes a world already tenanted by vast numbers of animals\r\namong which a struggle for existence was going on, and the few were\r\nvictorious over the many. But the entire inadequacy of Darwinism to\r\naccount for the primitive origin of life forms, for the original\r\ndiversity in the different branches of the tree of life forms, the\r\ninterdependence of the creation of ancient faunas and floras on\r\ngeological revolutions, and consequent sudden changes in the environment\r\nof organisms, has convinced us that Darwinism is but one of a number of\r\nfactors of a true evolution theory; that it comes in play only as the\r\nlast term of a series of evolutionary agencies or causes; and that it\r\nrather accounts, as first suggested by the Duke of Argyll, for the\r\n_preservation_ of forms than for their origination. We may, in fact,\r\ncompare Darwinism to the apex of a pyramid, the larger mass of the\r\npyramid representing the complex of theories necessary to account for\r\nthe world of life as it has been and now is. In other words, we believe\r\nin a modified and greatly extended Lamarckianism, or what may be called\r\nNeo-Lamarckianism.\"\r\n\r\n[227] _Studies in the Theory of Descent_.
