E. Retana’s “Vida y Escritos del Dr. José Rizal” and the “Lineage,\r\nLife, and Labors of José Rizal,” by Professor Austin Craig of the\r\nPhilippines University. Neither is accessible to the general American\r\npublic. Retana’s ponderous volume has never been translated. Professor\r\nCraig’s work was published in Manila but not in the United States and\r\nis to be found in only a few of the public libraries. Prefixed to\r\nCharles Derbyshire’s excellent translation of Rizal’s “Noli Me Tangere”\r\nis a biographical sketch, all too brief, of the author of the novel,\r\nbut even this is denied to most American readers, for it, too, is\r\npublished only in Manila.\r\n\r\nThe notes that Rizal left about himself, few, fragmentary, and sternly\r\nreticent, throwing a faint light upon his psychology and character but\r\nnext to nothing upon the stirring events of his life, are known only in\r\nthe Philippines. In an English magazine article published in 1902, Sir\r\nHugh Clifford, formerly governor of Ceylon, reviewed and estimated this\r\nstrange career, but no more than in outline. Three American magazines\r\nin the space of twenty-five years have devoted each a page or so to the\r\nsame subject. Buried in that monumental work, Blair and Robertson’s\r\n“Philippine Islands,” is liberal store of information about the\r\nhistoric background of the events hereinafter to be set forth, though\r\nfew readers seem to avail themselves of even this assistance. John\r\nForeman’s well known book with the same title has an interesting\r\nchapter about Rizal and his fate. An abbreviated translation of “Noli\r\nMe Tangere,” published in New York in 1900, contained a short account\r\nof his life and a version of his last poem. These, with fugitive\r\nreferences, are virtually the sum of the Rizal material the most\r\nresolute searcher has hitherto been able to find on American shelves.\r\n\r\nRetana’s work is interesting and abounding in pertinent facts, but so\r\noverloaded with documents and so prone to febrile exhilaration that it\r\ncould never be adapted to general circulation. Unluckily, too, it is\r\nnot always free from prejudice and not always accurate. Professor Craig\r\nwas the ideal investigator. With indefatigable patience he went over\r\nthe entire drama, beginning with the arrival of Lam-co in the\r\nPhilippines more than two hundred years before, and tracing the family\r\nto Rizal’s own day. He visited most of the places where Rizal had\r\nlived; he interviewed relatives, friends, acquaintances; he searched\r\nrecords, he compared documents, he weighed testimonies; he wrote with\r\nsympathy, he overstepped not the due bounds of reserve; and he produced\r\na book that so far as it goes is a model of honest inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe present work is founded chiefly upon his discoveries and Retana’s,\r\ncarefully compared, checked by reference to the writings of Derbyshire\r\nand to Rizal’s own diary, notes, and scant narrative; checked also by\r\nthe corrections of Dr. De Tavera and others, and augmented by later\r\nrevelations. Where a discrepancy has appeared in these records the\r\nauthors have sought the best obtainable advice and tried to follow the\r\nbest of the accepted authorities. In a few instances (since there are\r\ngaps in the story now unlikely to be filled) it has been necessary to\r\nadopt the version of an incident or the explanation of an act that\r\nseemed the most natural to a man in Rizal’s situation and the best\r\nadjustable to his character and convictions. Every recurrent “Rizal\r\nday” in the Philippines brings out thoughtful studies of the national\r\nhero, additional reminiscences, or the results of original research\r\nwork, all by native writers. Of this abundant material the authors have\r\navailed themselves, and thus have been able to enlarge or to correct\r\nmany episodes.\r\n\r\nThe authors are under obligations to the direction of the Philippine\r\nLibrary at Manila, which most generously put at their disposal all of\r\nits great collection of literature and objects relating to Rizal; to\r\nMr. Fernando Canon for his interesting personal reminiscences; to the\r\nHon. Jaime C. de Veyra, late resident commissioner from the Philippines\r\nto the United States, long a collector of Rizaliana, for rich material\r\nas well as for unstinted and invaluable assistance; to the Hon. Isauro\r\nGabaldon, present resident commissioner, for sympathetic encouragement;\r\nto Senator Sandiko for useful data; to Miss Sevilla for her\r\ninvestigations concerning Leonora Rivera; and to many good friends in\r\nManila and elsewhere that have contributed suggestions and corrected\r\nerrors. Mr. Benito Soliven’s masterly summary of Rizal’s work in\r\nscience and Dr. Eliseo Hervas’s estimate of Rizal’s place as a poet\r\nhave been most helpful. Of Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera’s admirable\r\ntreatise “El Carácter de Rizal” (Manila, 1918) free use has been made.\r\nMr. Pañina’s “Murió el Doctor Rizal Cristianamente?” has been carefully\r\nstudied. For the historical part of the narrative the authors have\r\nconsulted chiefly Fernández, Foreman, Barrows, and the great work of\r\nBlair and Robertson.\r\n\r\nThe citations from “Noli Me Tangere” and “El Filibusterismo” in the\r\nensuing pages are from the translations by Charles Derbyshire, both\r\npublished by the Philippine Education Company, Manila, 1912.\r\n\r\nTo understand Rizal and his strange story it is necessary to understand\r\nthe environment into which he was born and against which he protested.\r\nAs any description written now of Spanish rule as it really was in the\r\nPhilippines would seem to American readers of these days improbable or\r\neven fantastical, the needed background is supplied, so far as\r\npossible, in Rizal’s own words.\r\n\r\nAside from the human interest that would at any time attend a life so\r\ntragic, certain chief reasons have seemed to the authors sufficient to\r\njustify the appearance now of such a book:\r\n\r\n1. The hope to make available to American readers the story of the\r\ngreat man and national hero of the people the United States has\r\nundertaken to lead to national independence.\r\n\r\n2. At a time when race antagonisms seem to have been revived and\r\nemphasized, the fundamental truths about the universal household are\r\nnaturally obscured. Lest we forget how foolish, in the end, are the\r\npretended racial superiorities, it may be well to take note of this\r\nbrown man that revealed a genius so great, a mind so strangely\r\nresourceful, so wide a range in achievement, so unusual a character,\r\nwhile performing a service so momentous. Of a race too lightly esteemed\r\nby Caucasians, he left a record of which the foremost Caucasian people\r\nmight justly be proud.\r\n\r\n3. When the tide is running backward through the world and some men\r\nscoff at democracy and some men doubt it, there may be profit in\r\nturning to the story of this long-drawn-out struggle against autocracy\r\nto observe once more how inevitable, against all oppositions or frantic\r\narguings, is the democratic advance.\r\n\r\n4. A temporary fashion of detraction having left not even Lancelot\r\nbrave nor Galahad clean, it may be worth while to revive the fact that,\r\nafter all, men have lived on this earth that had other than merely\r\nselfish aims and felt other than merely sensual impulses, and find an\r\nexample in this Malay.\r\n\r\n5. When the world is resounding with the echoes of a terrible war, and\r\nhatreds seem to possess the souls of men, it may be well to consider\r\nthe career and influence of one that sought reforms by peaceful means,\r\nrepudiated force, and chose for his motto a sentiment broad enough to\r\ncover all human failings and cure most human hurts:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  To understand all is to forgive all.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.

Such from the beginning had\r\nbeen its practice in the long and uninspiring record of the Spanish\r\noccupation of the Philippines: sore oppression leading to inevitable\r\nrevolt and then savage vengeance that sowed the seed of more revolt.\r\nNow, as always in that delirious procedure, innocent natives were swept\r\nto punishment indiscriminately with the guilty; men that had taken part\r\nin the uprising and men that had never heard of it. With the rest of\r\nthese victims of insensate rage, marched, on the morning of February\r\n28, 1872, three beloved priests and servants of God, of whose\r\ncomplicity in the plot was never a shred of ponderable evidence. One of\r\nthem, lifting up his voice in prayer for his assassins as he went\r\nalong, was eighty-five years old. Not his years nor his gray hairs nor\r\nthose good works that had brought him honor [1] availed to save Father\r\nMariano Gomez from the most ignominious of deaths. With Fathers Burgos\r\nand Zamora, he was garroted on Bagumbayan Field, fronting the sea at\r\nManila; a place consecrated in the Filipino mind to memories terrible\r\nand yet grand. Native poets and orators that have seen there every\r\nblade of grass springing from the blood of heroes are hardly\r\nover-imaginative. On that spot to the same cause the same dull power\r\nsacrificed victim after victim, ending with the nation’s greatest and\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nBut now, in 1872, forgotten medieval brutalities seemed to be brought\r\nback to darken life in a region the sunniest and of right the most\r\ncheerful. Prisoners were tortured with instruments the world believed\r\nto exist only in museums; tortured with thumb-screws, great pincers,\r\nand machines of devilish ingenuity that produced and reiterated the\r\nagonies of drowning. [2] The whip was busy in the hands of men hired\r\nfor their expert knowledge of how it could be used to yield the largest\r\nfruition of pain; many a wretched Filipino that had in his heart no\r\nmore of disloyalty than you or I was flogged naked in the presence of\r\nofficers in whose ears his shrieks seemed to sound like music. Hysteria\r\nand fear in the minds of the dominant class were added to the racial\r\nhatred always festering there. Under the empire of this triad of the\r\nbeast, men that had worn the gloss of the almost classic society of\r\nMadrid became in the Philippines no better than hooting devils.\r\n\r\nTo the typical haughty Spaniard there the Filipino was an Indio, an\r\ninferior creature designed to render service to the white man’s needs\r\nand to receive the white man’s blows. Each successive generation of\r\nrulers had learned at least once, and always with astonishment and\r\ndisgust, that the lowly Indio was capable of combinations and\r\nresistances that sometimes shook the walls of Malacañan itself and\r\nstarted painful visions of massacres and wild fleeings. From the\r\nbeginning to the end of the story, it was a discovery that first exiled\r\nreason and then multiplied work to the executioner. Yet the knowledge\r\ngained in this way by one generation never seemed to enlighten the\r\nnext: each revolt created in its turn the same astonishment, as if for\r\nthe first time in human experience wronged men had turned against their\r\nwrongers. Each generation, therefore, had the same obtuse notion of\r\nviolent repression as the only answer to the natives’ complaint, a\r\nconcept that each left with additions of its own to its successor.\r\nHence the complex savageries of 1872, which might be regarded as in a\r\nway accretionary; not a soul in the governing class seeming to suspect,\r\ndespite all this rich experience, that the essence of the slayings was\r\nno better than one revenge making ready for another.\r\n\r\nIn those evil days millions of Filipinos rendered to the dominant\r\ntyranny what it compelled them to render and kept alive in their proud\r\nhearts the longing for justice, the love of their country, and a\r\nrespect for their race. One of these, Francisco Rizal Mercado, was then\r\nliving in Calamba, a little town on the west shore of the great lake of\r\nLaguna de Bay. Manila was twenty-five miles to the northward; the tall\r\nmountains of Luzon, Mount Makiling and others, gloomed or shone south\r\nand west; the plains around were fertile and well cultivated; it was a\r\npleasant and profitable region. Francisco Mercado was of some substance\r\nand a character so excellent that all the country-side knew and honored\r\nhim; a sturdy, resolute, reasoning man, wide-eyed, square-headed. He\r\nhad prospered by diligence and deserving; his large two-storied\r\ndwelling was the best in Calamba. Overawing guns and the military\r\nchecked his spirit but never daunted it. In his house the Government’s\r\nkey-hole listeners and hired porch-climbers were defied, and no one\r\nhesitated to discuss the evils that had befallen the land.\r\n\r\nOne of the most detested instruments of the Spanish supremacy was a\r\nbody of troops called the Civil Guard, [3] a kind of military police\r\ncharged with ferreting out disloyalty and the signs of revolt. In the\r\nstrained relations between Government and governed that followed the\r\ncruelties of 1872, it may be imagined how zestfully the Civil Guards\r\npursued their peculiar calling. Domiciliary visits were their\r\nspecialty, sudden and without warrant; a species of terrorism not then\r\npractised anywhere in Europe outside of Russia and Turkey. A squad of\r\nthese visitors was in the habit of watching Calamba and the neighboring\r\ntown of Biñan, and when it was Calamba that they were favoring with\r\ntheir attention, the lieutenant commanding quartered himself and his\r\nhorse upon the Mercados, where he could find the best fare and the best\r\nfodder in town.\r\n\r\nThe crops in 1871 had not been good in that region. Mr. Mercado’s store\r\nof fodder diminished until he had barely enough to supply his own live\r\nstock. When next the lieutenant came the situation was explained to\r\nhim, and with every politeness he was asked to bait his horse\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nHe chose to take the request as an affront. Reciprocal hatreds were\r\nthick and rife around him; he conceived that in some way his honor as a\r\nSpaniard had been impaired by a “miserable Indio,” and he swore\r\nrevenge. [4]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the unfortunate Mercado managed to offend another\r\nSpaniard still more powerful. For all such visitors to Calamba he kept\r\na kind of gratuitous hotel; hospitality was and is a sacred and\r\ninviolable rite among his people. The judge of the local district,\r\nconferring upon the Mercados thus the honor of his uninvited presence,\r\nfancied that his reception lacked something of cordiality and ceremony.\r\nAs to this, he may have been right; in the hearts of most intelligent\r\nFilipinos of those days the feelings toward official Spaniards were not\r\nlikely to be exuberantly warm. The judge, like the lieutenant before\r\nhim, deemed his Spanish honor to have suffered and went away with a\r\nsimilar appetite for vengeance, a lust to which the example of their\r\nGovernment richly incited them.\r\n\r\nFor judge and lieutenant the opportunity came more quickly than they\r\ncould have hoped. At this neighboring town of Biñan lived José Alberto\r\nRealonda (formerly Alonzo), a half-brother of Mrs. Mercado. He was\r\ndeservedly of mark in his province; his father had been an engineer\r\nwhose abilities were recognized by Spain in an order of knighthood that\r\nthe son inherited, an order equivalent to a baronetcy in England; José\r\nAlberto himself had been at school in Calcutta, spoke English well, and\r\nhad traveled widely. It was at his home in Biñan that Sir John Bowring,\r\n[5] the English linguist and traveler, had been entertained; and\r\nBowring had put into his book on the Philippines a graceful paragraph\r\nabout his host and entertainment, the good taste with which the\r\nRealonda house was furnished, the excellent cooking set before its\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nDon José Alberto had married young, and, as the event showed, not\r\nwisely. His wife was his cousin. They quarreled and separated, and the\r\nwife seems to have set afoot wild and fantastic stories, injurious to\r\nher husband. Divorces were difficult in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nFrom material no better than these the lieutenant now manufactured\r\nagainst Mrs. Mercado and her brother a charge of conspiracy to murder\r\nMrs. Realonda. It was a preposterous tale, but to such tales the\r\ninstitutions that, in those parts, by a figure of speech, were called\r\ncourts of justice were in the habit of lending a ready ear if thereby\r\nthey served any end of the dominant power or gratified a powerful\r\nSpaniard. In probably no other corner of the world with a pretense to\r\nChristian civilization was the judicial system so farcical; the next\r\ndevelopments were typical of the conditions under which seven million\r\npeople dwelt at the mercy of perjurers, adventurers, and thieves. With\r\njoy the incensed judge received the accusation and ordered Mrs. Mercado\r\nto be arrested and imprisoned in the provincial jail.\r\n\r\nThis, although but left-handed and imperfect revenge, accorded with the\r\nideas and practices of the governing class. The grievances of the judge\r\nand the lieutenant, if they had any, were against Mr. Mercado; they\r\nevened the score by striking not at him but at his wife.\r\nIncomprehensible or almost insane as this will seem to a healthier\r\nsense of honor, it was a custom of which we shall find other and more\r\npainful instances. Suppose the governing class, or a member of it, to\r\nbelieve the much cherished supremacy of the white race to demand that\r\nan example be made of an offending native. No nice discrimination was\r\ndeemed necessary. If the offender was not available, retribution could\r\nstill be inflicted upon the offender’s wife, or upon his children or\r\neven upon his brother-in-law or his great aunt, if he had no children,\r\nor if his wife was not within striking distance. In fairness to the\r\nSpaniards we are to note that this singular reversion was not a product\r\nof nationality but of geography; many a man defended vicarious\r\nvengeance in the Philippines that would have scorned it in Spain, so\r\nwonderful are the moral idiocies into which imperialism drives us.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mercado was ordered from her home to the prison at Santa Cruz, the\r\nprovincial capital, at the other side of the lake. Ordinarily, traffic\r\nwith Calamba was by steamer; but a road, rough and ill made, led along\r\nthe shore. The more to taste the pleasures of his revenge, the judge\r\nordered Mrs. Mercado to be conducted by this road and on foot; that is\r\nto say, about twenty miles and in the sun.\r\n\r\nIt will later appear in this narrative that she was no ordinary woman;\r\nshe came from a household that believed in liberty; she seems to have\r\nhad a lofty spirit and a certain dignified self-mastery not rare among\r\nFilipino women. All about that part of the province she was known for\r\nher charities and good neighborliness. Her compatriots liked her. When,\r\ntherefore, trudging along the shore road under the custody of a guard,\r\nshe came at the evening of the first day to a village, she was received\r\nby its inhabitants with outpourings of sympathy and an invitation to\r\nlodge at the best house in the place instead of the village lockup as\r\nthe judge had thoughtfully intended. She accepted the invitation; but\r\nwith insatiable malice he had followed to see how his orders were\r\nobeyed. When he found the prisoner well bestowed instead of undergoing\r\nthe miseries of the filthy prison, a madness of rage came upon him. He\r\nbroke down the door of the house where his victim was sheltered, and,\r\njudge as he was, hesitated not to assault with his cane both the\r\nunlucky guard that had shown her lenity and the owner of the house that\r\nhad received her. [6]\r\n\r\nHe was as merciful as the judicial system he adorned; as intelligent\r\nand as well ordered. One of the least of its offenses was that this\r\nsame hedge-row magistrate, at whose order she had been arrested to\r\ngratify his spite, was also to be the prosecuting attorney, when she\r\nshould be brought to trial, and the judge before whom her fate should\r\nbe decided. Mr. Mercado, meanwhile, had been putting forth every\r\npeaceful means to rescue his wife from this disaster. He had secured an\r\nattorney, who now presented a petition that her case should not be\r\nallowed to come before a judge so manifestly prejudiced against her.\r\nWhile Mrs. Mercado lay in jail, this appeal went before the supreme\r\ncourt, which sustained it and ordered the prisoner’s release. Before\r\nshe could be set free the unjust judge brought a new charge against\r\nher, that her petition alleging prejudice on his part constituted\r\ncontempt of court.\r\n\r\nOn this she continued to be a prisoner until another appeal could be\r\nmade to the supreme assize. When it had been reached and argued,\r\nDogberry wisdom seated upon this august bench upheld the court below\r\nand found that such a petition was indeed contempt. How, that being the\r\ncase, a prisoner could ever escape from a court or judge manifestly\r\nhostile to her, these eminent authorities did not suggest. But as Mrs.\r\nMercado had already been in jail much longer than the term of the\r\nsentence passed upon her for contempt, they ordered her liberation.\r\n\r\nIt was now to be supposed that the end of this business had been\r\nreached, vengeance had been satisfied, the crime of not feeding the\r\nlieutenant’s horse had been atoned for, and the woman might return to\r\nher family. Not in the Philippines, certainly. Before the prison doors\r\ncould open, a new charge was brought against her.\r\n\r\nShe was alleged by the judge-prosecutor-tribunal to have committed\r\ntheft. [7]\r\n\r\nHere is an incident luminous upon the society of that day and region;\r\nwe had better pursue it. All this time, Mrs. Mercado’s half-brother,\r\nJosé Alberto, the engineer, whose unfortunate marriage had wrought so\r\nmuch of trouble, had been a prisoner in the same jail, similarly beset\r\nwith accusing inventions. He had a moderate fortune; therefore the\r\nstory went around that he had much money concealed about him. The scent\r\nof the peso was ever strong in the nostrils of the jail officials and\r\ncourt attendants. When the gold could not be found in José Alberto’s\r\ncell, the searchers for it reasonably concluded that the half-sister\r\nmust have taken it, possibly by means of an astral presence or through\r\nsome form of witchcraft.\r\n\r\nFor this rank imagining there was even less of basis than there had\r\nbeen for the conspiracy charge; yet it was months in falling apart.\r\nWhen it had dissolved in its own absurdity another quite as unfounded\r\ntook its place. Justice à la espagnole—in the Philippines. Two years\r\npassed in these futilities. It was apparently the purpose of the\r\nauthorities to keep their helpless victim in prison the rest of her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFrom such a fate she was now rescued by another incident not less than\r\nher imprisonment typical of misgovernment under which the country\r\ngroaned. The governor-general of all the Philippines, representative in\r\nhis single person of the might and majesty of Spain, came to Calamba on\r\na tour. Among the entertainments offered in his honor was dancing by\r\nchildren. One of the little girls by her grace and beauty particularly\r\nwon the governor-general’s applause. He asked her what he could do for\r\nher. She said he could release her mother from prison. She was Mrs.\r\nMercado’s daughter, and by this detour and purified recrudescence of\r\nSalome and Herod was Mrs. Mercado snatched at last from her persecutors\r\nand got again to her home. [8]\r\n\r\nIt was a populous household that welcomed her return; she had already\r\nborne eleven children to her husband, rearing them with an\r\nold-fashioned and sedulous care not yet out of vogue in the\r\nPhilippines. Immigration had much affected the original Island strains;\r\non both sides the family was of mixed descent. One of Mr. Mercado’s\r\nancestors was Lam-co, a Chinaman of means and character that came to\r\nthe Islands in the latter part of the seventeenth century. He settled\r\nat Biñan, was converted to Christianity, and was baptized in 1697,\r\ntaking the name of Domingo. At Biñan he married the daughter of another\r\nChinaman, whose wife was a mestiza, or half-caste Filipino. From this\r\ntime on Chinese blood was mixed with Malay [9] until in 1847 Francisco\r\nMercado, descendant of Lam-co, married Teodora Alonzo, a Filipino lady\r\nof a distinguished family, partly Chinese in ancestry, and came to live\r\nat Calamba. It was her lot, twenty-five years later, to be the victim\r\nof the strange story of persecution and villainy here related.\r\n\r\nThe seventh of her children, José, was then eleven years old and a\r\nstudent in a preparatory school in Manila. Upon his mind the reports\r\nthat came to him of the successive steps in her degradation stamped\r\nthemselves as if in iron. Even when he had become a mature man, famous,\r\naccomplished, absorbed in studies and achievements at the other side of\r\nthe busy world, the thought of that great wrong haunted and goaded him.\r\nYet it had been no novelty, even in his short experience; it had been\r\nno more than a focus, upon the one household he knew best, of wrongs\r\nwith which other households were familiar and of which he had often\r\nheard. All his conscious days he had been aware, and ever better aware,\r\nof the cold, black, implacable despotism that had yoked and now drove\r\nand lashed his people. He knew well the hateful excesses of the Civil\r\nGuard, the license and arrogance of the governing class, the extortion\r\nand thefts, the infinite scorn in which the subject race was held, the\r\nintolerable parody of justice, the bitter jest of the code and the\r\ncourt-room, the flogging of men, the violating of women, the protected\r\nmurderers, the rapists that went untouched and unabashed. When he was\r\nonly five years old he used to sit on the shore of that beautiful green\r\nlake, the Laguna de Bay, and look across it and wonder if the people\r\nthat lived on the other side were as wretched as the people of Calamba,\r\nwhether they were beaten, kicked and trodden upon, whether they dwelt\r\nin the same terror of the Civil Guards and the flogging-rods. [10] He\r\nsaid years afterward that even then he had a distinct conviction that\r\nthese things were not necessary and that there must be some region on\r\nthe earth where its children could be happy and enjoy the sunshine, the\r\nflowers, and the beautiful things that seemed made for their delight.\r\n\r\nMany of the troubles that fell upon his neighbors, or were laid upon\r\nthem by the existing System, were troubles about land; and before ever\r\nthe malicious lieutenant had begun his revenges upon the family, young\r\nJosé was familiar with stories of the wrongs the so-called courts\r\ninflicted upon tenants and the men that tilled the farms. It was\r\nmiserable business for any child to master, if he was to make his way\r\nthrough life as anything but a gloomy misanthrope. Yet such things for\r\nhis people made the world into which he had come. Doubtless much may be\r\nsaid to excuse the System the Spaniards maintained in the Philippines:\r\nthey had inherited it, they had not the skill nor the inspiration to\r\nbetter it, and the like extenuations; when all is said, it remains but\r\nhideously stupid and cruel. In the beginning it was medievalism,\r\nneither better nor worse than was to be found in the sixteenth century\r\nin the most of Europe. Planted upon the other side of the globe as if\r\nupon another planet, it missed all the vivifying and enlightening\r\ninfluences that drew Europe out of the slough. The Philippines stuck as\r\nthey were; Europe lumbered ahead. In all the world one could not find\r\nanother such phenomenon, the sixteenth century cold-storaged for the\r\ninstruction of the nineteenth. Whosoever might wish to observe in\r\naction the political and social ideas of Philip the Second needed but\r\nto journey to the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAlmost nothing had changed there. In Europe ideas had dawned of a free\r\npress, free speech, general education, the ballot-box, parliamentary\r\ngovernment, the rights of the individual, the immaculate nature of\r\njustice, the determining of legal causes by unimpeachable processes,\r\nthe gradual eclipse of the monarchical conception of society, the\r\npassing of the barony. Not one of these had come near the Philippines.\r\nGovernment there was the autocracy of a privileged class, tempered\r\nslightly by occasional revolutions, unlimited and unrestrained by any\r\nother consideration, and carried on chiefly for personal\r\naggrandizement.\r\n\r\nInstead of freedom of publication, the censor sat upon an impregnable\r\nthrone and scrutinized not merely every word to be printed in every\r\njournal but every book that was imported, even in a traveler’s\r\nhand-baggage. Instead of free speech, the natives might not even\r\npetition of their grievances. Instead of general education, the masses\r\nwere of a purpose kept in ignorance. Instead of justice, they must lead\r\ntheir lives without other protection than they could win by a feigned\r\nhumility beneath the arbitrary power of their rulers.\r\n\r\nIt was in such surroundings that this boy came into his consciousness.\r\nHe had a mind receptive and powerful. By no possibility could these\r\nimpressions fail to be reflected in his thinkings and then in his life.\r\nOther youths the same environment drove into sullen apathy, racial\r\nfatalism, or a life fed with always disappointed hopes of revenge. This\r\nboy they drew along a path of strange adventures and almost\r\nunprecedented achievement to a place among the great men of all times.\r\n\r\nThe roots of this story begin three centuries before the Mercado family\r\nat Calamba was caught up in its heartbreaking intrigues. After what was\r\ncalled the “discovery” of the Philippines by Magellan, March 16, 1521,\r\nSpain laid claim to the entire Archipelago, more than two thousand\r\nsizable Islands. [11] Portugal disputed this, neither having the\r\nslightest just basis for its claim, until 1529, when the pope settled\r\nthe quarrel out of hand and gave the Philippines to Spain. In 1570 the\r\ntaking by a Spanish expedition of the capital city of Manila was\r\nassumed to have put the physical seal upon this deed of gift, and Spain\r\nproceeded to annex and to govern such of the Islands as she could by\r\npersuasion or beating induce to accept her sovereignty. From the first\r\nthe tenancy was incongruous and precarious; Europe of the Middle Ages\r\nlaid upon a civilization more ancient, wholly alien, and traditionally\r\nwell rooted. What followed is a tangle of inconsistencies. On the\r\nadministrative side, Spain with musket-balls shot order and obedience\r\ninto the natives; from first to last the rulers had but the one broad\r\npolicy, which was to overawe the people they ruled and to subjugate\r\nthem with fear. On the cultural side the account was at first wholly\r\ndifferent. That they might give to these same natives the blessings of\r\nChristianity and the gospel of peace, the heroic Spanish missionary\r\npriests endured trials compared with which most martyrdoms seemed easy.\r\nThus in a naïve way, rather startling now to contemplate, perdition and\r\nparadise were to be glimpsed side by side, brute force marched with an\r\napostolic love, and bullets were distributed with the Bible.\r\n\r\nBut, before the labors and good deeds of the missionary priests,\r\nscoffing falls silent. The soldier slew and destroyed; the priest\r\nplanted schools, spread knowledge, bettered conditions. He did not even\r\nwait for the soldier to break a way or to indicate security, but\r\nplunged ahead of the armies into the wilderness where he knew he was\r\nlikely to leave his bones.\r\n\r\nWhether when all is said the general balance-sheet of the Spanish\r\noccupation shows more net advantages or disadvantages for the Filipino\r\ncan be argued plausibly either way. In such a welter of conflicting\r\ntestimonies the fair-minded will be slow to judge. We shall have to\r\ndeal again with the question when we come to see how in his mature\r\nyears José Rizal reacted to it and how his analyses disposed of the\r\ncommonest of the Spanish claims. Considering it here in its due\r\nhistoric place, we may first remind ourselves that with all her faults\r\nSpain had at least one great virtue. She pretended no altruism. On a\r\nsordid impulse she took the Islands; she kept them merely as goods.\r\n\r\nAs to this debated point the findings of Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera seem\r\nclear. [12]\r\n\r\n“Those that are wont to depreciate civilization and material\r\ndevelopment to the point of being inexact,” he says, “cite the voyage\r\nof Magellan as an enterprise motived only by religious ideals and by\r\nsincerest and purest charity. They misrepresent or forget two\r\nincontestible facts. First, the voyage of Magellan was proposed to and\r\naccepted by the King of Spain, was approved by his ministers and was\r\ncarried out by Magellan and his companions for the mercantile purpose\r\nof discovering, by sailing westward, a route to the Moluccas and thus\r\nwresting from the hands of Portugal the rich commerce that pertained to\r\nthose, the Spice Islands. This and nothing else was the origin,\r\ninspiration and object of that famous expedition. Second, such a\r\npurpose could be realized precisely because the Spaniards had achieved\r\na material development that inspired the enterprise and made it\r\npossible.”\r\n\r\nThe more honor, then, to the Spaniards, who, having in view only the\r\npurposes of a bargain, still added much to the equipment of the\r\nIslanders. They erected better buildings than the Filipinos had ever\r\nknown, made better roads, introduced, with whatsoever cruelties, a\r\nbetter coördination, something like uniform laws, something like a\r\nwelded and coherent polity; they discouraged piracy when it could no\r\nlonger serve to subdue the natives; they gave money for schools,\r\nwhether these were efficient or otherwise; they made some connection,\r\nhowever frail, between the culture of the Islands and that formerly\r\nexisting in the rest of the world. Yet, aside from the labors of the\r\nmissionaries, the other boons that followed their red trail are\r\ndoubtful. Accepting these at the Spanish valuation, the fact still\r\nseems to protrude that Spain found an industrious population and\r\nmanaged to leave it indifferent and indolent, [13] found one style of\r\ncivilization and left another.\r\n\r\nPrejudice and racial hatreds have obscured about this one other fact\r\nthat never should be overlooked. The Filipinos would not have stood\r\nstill if the Spaniards had left them alone. True estimate, therefore,\r\nis to be made, not on a comparison between what they were when the\r\nSpaniards came and what they were when the Spaniards left them, but on\r\nwhat they probably would have made of themselves. They were no backward\r\nrace; they had shown a remarkable aptitude to absorb the best of the\r\nprogress around them, taking on arts, inventions, manufactures, and\r\ndeveloping them. They made and used gunpowder before it was known in\r\nEurope; they made and used cannon of a considerable size, built better\r\nsea-going ships than the Spaniards, had developed more skilful\r\nartificers in silver and gold, and had evidently a disposition to\r\nimprove methods and manners. [14] In those three hundred years,\r\nsupposing them to have been left to their own devices, they would never\r\nhave ceased to look forward. Yet when the line comes to be drawn below\r\nthe items of their progress under Spanish control and we glance across\r\neven to the most dilatory countries of Europe, we are compelled to\r\nadmit that relatively the advance is small.\r\n\r\nBut because the natives writhed under the crude and savage oppression\r\nthat walked with this, we are not to suppose the Spaniards they hated\r\nwere all bad men. Goodness and badness hardly enter into the matter.\r\nThere came to the Philippines in these 325 years many a\r\ngovernor-general with a worthy inspiration to overturn the tables of\r\nthe money-changers and bring in righteousness and justice. It appears\r\nthat what was going on in the Philippines was not always ignored at\r\nhome, and many a private citizen of good character started out to\r\nsupport a reforming governor-general. The significant fact is that all\r\nthese efforts had one end. Nothing was ever changed. The best of the\r\ngovernor-generals fell impotent against the same menacing wall of\r\nSystem. Securely it had been based upon favoring conditions; it had\r\ngrown under generations of greedy maladministration; it extended to\r\nevery part of the Archipelago where Spain had authority; and it was\r\nbuttressed by the power that in all times has proved the most difficult\r\nfoe to the freedom and progress of the masses. For such is the power of\r\naccumulated profits to breed more power to make more profits and still\r\nmore power. Here was indeed the appetite that grows by what it feeds\r\non. The invisible government had swallowed the visible.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, for a long time, nothing is to be subtracted from the\r\nwork of the fathers of the church. A noble zeal animated them; often\r\nthey added to it a fine tact, much practical wisdom, unlimited capacity\r\nfor self-denial, and even self-immolation. Years went by; the\r\nmissionary era came to an end; there was no longer the splendor of the\r\napostolic adventure into the jungle. A different spirit began to\r\npossess a part of the clergy; not all of it, but a part. Marvelously\r\nrich the country was that Spain had annexed in this fashion; hardly\r\nanywhere else had nature bestowed a more fertile soil with a more\r\npleasing climate. For two hundred years the Government at Madrid, with\r\nan excess of stupidity, restrained the natural development of this Eden\r\nby narrowly limiting its trade. Only to Mexico and only by means of one\r\ngalleon a year could the struggling colony export its products; a\r\nprocess of strangulation into which some bugaboo of competition had\r\nharried the merchants of Barcelona and so the poor foolish Government.\r\nAfter 1815, as liberalism and the beneficent results of the French\r\nRevolution began to make their belated appearance in Spain, these\r\nrestrictions were cautiously relaxed, and at once the value of\r\nPhilippine lands began to increase.\r\n\r\nFour orders of European friars [15] had settled themselves in the\r\nPhilippines, obtaining in the early days from the insular Government\r\ngrants of estates that because of the lack of adequate surveying and\r\nfor other reasons were of shadowy boundaries. As trade increased it\r\nmultiplied the demand for Philippine products. Under this pressure,\r\nforests once covering great areas of rich land were cleared away by\r\npioneers that settled upon the soil they had made tillable. In hundreds\r\nof cases the friars laid claim to such lands and demanded of the\r\nsettlers possession or rents. If the settler resisted, the Civil Guard\r\nor other military force ejected him. If he sought relief in the courts\r\nhe had only his heavy expenses for his pains.\r\n\r\nThus the monastic orders had become the System. Accumulated wealth had\r\nwrought upon them the effects it ever achieves everywhere. Originally\r\nthey had come to the Philippines with a pure notion of doing good; now\r\nthey were caught in the soiled entanglements of gain. Through all the\r\nsequel a gap widened between the four orders and the rest of the\r\nchurch. Other clergy, notably the native priests, continued to serve,\r\naccording to their lights, the professed objects of religion; the four\r\norders were four great corporations, indurated with profits, playing\r\nthe callous landlord, extorting rents, harassing tenants, extending\r\ntheir operations, and with every new peso of their hoards strengthening\r\ntheir influence upon Malacañan, the seat of the administration. So\r\nworks the law that inevitably attends upon accretion. Gradually they\r\ndispossessed the military, official, and merchant castes that at first\r\nhad been all in all. Such potency as in other countries belongs to\r\nbanks or great industrial companies lay now in their hands. Whatsoever\r\nthey wished, that, by one means or another, they won. It is not humanly\r\npossible that under such conditions men should not deteriorate; the men\r\nthat sway so gross a rule, the men upon whom it is swayed.\r\n\r\nIt was so here. The friars of the orders became intolerable local\r\ntyrants. In the rural regions, the word of the curate, if he was of the\r\ndominant caste, outweighed the command of the provincial governor. As a\r\nrule the governor-general himself dared not in any way oppose the\r\nclerical domination; a few words lightly whispered at Madrid would be\r\nenough to make sure his recall and ruin. One of these governors that\r\ntried to assert his own authority had to fight a clerical mob in his\r\nown palace, and fell dead, sword in hand, across the body of his son.\r\n[16] The lesson did not need repetition; thenceforth the successors of\r\nthe Governor-General Bustamante of 1719 made haste to placate a power\r\nso great and so malignant. Even the redoubtable Emiliano Weyler himself\r\nwas careful and obsequious to maintain good relations with the four\r\norders. Nay, he went to the length of supervising the ejection of\r\nsettlers from the lands the friars claimed, and in at least one\r\ninstance, as we shall see, accelerated the work with a battery of\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nIt is now reasonably certain that most of these claims were without\r\nmerit, but unlimited power had produced among the orders the effect it\r\nhas had in all ages and climes upon the men that have possessed it.\r\nOver a certain genus of temperament the evil spell seems too great to\r\nbe abridged by religion or by anything else. Nothing in the so-called\r\ncivilizing adventures of Europe upon the fringes of the earth has been\r\nmore clearly proved than that the white man, removed from the\r\nrestraining influence of home and his neighbors and clothed with\r\nirresponsible power over people whom he deems inferior, is capable of\r\nreversion to an astonishing tyranny. The records of the Congo, of Dr.\r\nPeters in South Africa, of the Germans in the South Seas, are easy\r\nillustrations on a large scale of what happened here in little.\r\n\r\nIt has been the huge blunder of Europeans dealing with the Malay to\r\nmistake his patience for weakness and his silence for acquiescence.\r\nAliens imposing themselves by force upon a remote people of another\r\ncolor have seldom been at pains to pick up the keys to the psychology\r\nof the governed. Great is the misery that would have been avoided for\r\nthe dark-skinned children of earth by the use of this simple process,\r\nand nowhere was it simpler than in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAll these influences and causes were at work to make trouble. Partly by\r\ntheir own excesses, partly by becoming the symbols and visualized\r\nrepresentatives of the whole foreign domination, with all its\r\nintolerable wrongs and oppressions, the friars were now the objects of\r\na deathless hatred. Hardly were the landlords of old more abhorred by\r\nthe Irish peasantry.\r\n\r\nIt was a people capable by nature of much hating as of much loving upon\r\nwhom fell this bitter inheritance. One can only suppose that the\r\naverage Spaniard in the Philippines stood sentinel against himself lest\r\nhe should understand the people he thought were under his boot-heel. In\r\npoint of fact, they were not stupid and inferior, as he always\r\ndescribed them, but of an excellent mentality, quick apprehension,\r\nreasoning powers at least equal to his own, of a certain inheritance of\r\nculture, different, cruder, but in its way not less. Particularly they\r\nwere a people in whom resentment against injustice might smolder long\r\nbut only in the end to blaze into perilous fires. Three centuries of\r\nSpanish domination had not extirpated the Malayan instinct for liberty,\r\nbut, judging from the climax of all this, only intensified it. Spanish\r\nofficers watching with intent eyes for the least sign of revolt took\r\nfrom these people every discoverable weapon, even to bolos (knives) of\r\nblades longer than so many inches. The better organization, discipline,\r\nequipment, and military skill that alone constituted Spanish supremacy\r\nwas for ever being paraded in the eyes of the Indios. At every turn\r\nthey were reminded in some way of their position, helpless, barehanded,\r\nand kept from one another by enmities the Spaniards knew well how to\r\nfoster. In the face of all this sedulous care, behold in the story of\r\ntheir possession of the Philippines a serial of insurrection! Between\r\n1573 and 1872, thirty-one revolts had been serious enough to leave\r\nenduring records in history. [17]\r\n\r\nGoing over these records now, no one can fail to see that the uprisings\r\nwere progressive; however lamely inaugurated, poorly armed,\r\nfallaciously led, each was of an aspect more serious than its\r\npredecessor. Any Spaniard with the least skill in reading human history\r\ncould have foretold the result. As education spread, as mankind\r\nelsewhere struggled more and more into comparative liberty, as the\r\nsense of injustice grew in the Filipino heart, the day would come when\r\nthese people, too, would be driven to unite for the one great\r\nall-embracing, all-inspiring object of national freedom and national\r\nexistence, and they would win it.\r\n\r\nTo this the friars and the governing class of the Philippines were now\r\ncontributing by providing the immediate sting that seems always to be\r\nneeded when an old and deep-lying resentment is to be goaded into\r\noutward and physical activities. The friars and the governing class\r\nwere palpable; their acts of oppression were daily before the people’s\r\nobservation; but what they stood for as the emblems of a general\r\ncondition was much more important than anything they did. Stories of\r\nmen with causes just and righteous that had been ruined at the friars’\r\ndictation in the farcical courts; stories of men and women persecuted\r\nas Mrs. Mercado had been persecuted; stories of men beaten to death,\r\nmen strangled and men shot, men deported and women wronged, were\r\nbrooded over in thousands of barrios. [18] They but completed the tale\r\nof three hundred years of government with the iron fist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSCHOOL-DAYS AND FIRST IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boy that so early and by this savage tuition came to be initiated\r\ninto his people’s sorrows was then chiefly remarkable for a gentle,\r\ntractable disposition and a liking for books and study. He had been\r\nborn at Calamba, June 19, 1861. In his earliest childhood he seemed\r\nundersized and undervitalized; but when he was six years old there came\r\nto his father’s house his uncle Manuel, a figure of health and a\r\nresolute practitioner of open-air sports, who took José in hand and\r\nwith daily exercises and rigorous living built his body to normal\r\nstrength and agility. Filipinos have a natural aptitude for athletics;\r\nhe verified now the ancestral blood in his veins. He ran and jumped; he\r\ntook long walks; he learned to fence, to ride, and to like the sun and\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nBy all accounts he must have been a singularly attractive child, even\r\nin a country where handsome children are common. His color was the fine\r\ntint of his people, a light, clean, even brown; his face a delicate\r\noval, but the chin firm and rather long; the forehead nobly shaped, the\r\nnose almost classical, the lips full but nothing sensual. His eyes had\r\na hardly discernible slant; when he was animated they flashed out of\r\nblack depths a kind of black fire; but when he was quiescent they\r\nseemed gravely introspective. Long afterward his neighbors and\r\nrelatives, trying to recall his boyhood, and perhaps overstraining\r\nmemory, thought he seemed always much older than his years, a notion\r\nthat may have arisen from his unusual habits. He liked to read or be\r\nread to; he liked at times to be alone; he liked to hear his elders\r\nargue; he liked to go to church to see the people there; and he liked\r\nto reason.\r\n\r\nJosé Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda was his full name, made\r\nup in the Spanish fashion from both sides of his house, paternal as far\r\nas the connecting “y,” and maternal the rest of the road. Philippine\r\nnames seem to the Anglo-Saxon mind a riddle that adds unnecessarily to\r\nthe burdens of life. This boy was to be known all his life as José\r\nRizal; his father had been and was always thereafter known as Francisco\r\nMercado, his mother as Doña Teodora Alonzo. Francisco, the father, and\r\nall Francisco’s younger brothers in a family of twelve called\r\nthemselves Rizal as much as Mercado and the rest; none of his older\r\nbrothers used Rizal; all of his children bore it as their family name.\r\nYet family name it was never, according to western standards; for it\r\nwas added in 1849 by virtue of a proclamation of the governor-general\r\nand by the whim of the man then head of the house. A strange difficulty\r\nhad arisen in the Philippines. The original Tagalog (or other native)\r\nsurnames being invincible against the Spanish tongue, Spanish names\r\nwere used as substitutes, but not, one might think, with sufficient\r\nvariety. Religious fervor overworked the popularity of some of these\r\nuntil there arose an inextricable confusion: seventeen Antonio de la\r\nCruzes in one town, all unrelated; twelve Francisco de los Santoses in\r\na single street. This knot the wise old Governor-General Claveria [19]\r\ncut with ready sword. He provided a list of Spanish names, apparently\r\ncopied in alphabetical order from the Madrid directory, and required\r\nthe head of each family to take one of these, add it at the rear or\r\nfront of whatever other names he was then carrying, and hand it down to\r\nhis children. [20] The father of Francisco Mercado met the spirit of\r\nthe decree but evaded its letter. He chose for his official name of\r\nnames Rizal, which was not on the governor-general’s list, but passed\r\nmuster. It is a corruption of the Spanish word ricial, and means a\r\ngreen field or pasture; being here a poetic recognition, maybe, of the\r\nblessed state of Mercado’s own rentals.\r\n\r\nIn the long and many syllabled cognomen, sounding like a verse of the\r\nÆneid, with which José was baptized, is to be noticed the name\r\nRealonda. This was from his mother’s family, where it also was an\r\ninnovation of the ingenious Claveria. Her family had long been known as\r\nAlonzo. [21]\r\n\r\nThose that like to go over the first records of great men in search of\r\nphenomena foreshadowing something unusual in after-life will never be\r\ndisappointed here. José mastered his alphabet when he was three years\r\nold, and before he was five could read in a Spanish version of the\r\nVulgate from which his mother had taught him at her knee. [22] In other\r\nways his debt to her was unusual; she turned his mind in his earliest\r\nyears toward good literature, in which she had a discerning taste,\r\nbeing for her times and environment of rare learning and college bred\r\nin Manila. [23] With other accomplishments she knew and loved good\r\npoetry, could make it herself, and early taught José to make it. He\r\ngrew up thus with the advantage of a bilingual background. About him\r\nthe common speech was Tagalog; his mother made Spanish fairly familiar\r\nto his ear.\r\n\r\nOnce she read to him a moral tale, “The Moth and the Candle,”\r\ntranslating as she went along, and emphasizing the lesson. The moth had\r\nbeen told by its mother to keep away from the flame, and now see what\r\nhappened. A cocoanut-oil lamp was burning on the table as she read;\r\nwinged insects were flying about and losing their lives in the blaze.\r\nJosé became much more interested in them than in the salutary warnings\r\nof his mother. He said afterward that he was not so much sorry for the\r\ninsects that lost their lives as fascinated by their fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The advice and warnings sounded feebly in my ears [he wrote]. What\r\n    I thought of most was the death of the heedless moth. But in the\r\n    depths of my heart I did not blame it. My mother’s care had not\r\n    quite the result she intended.\r\n\r\n    Years have passed since then. The child has become a man. He has\r\n    crossed the most famous rivers of other countries. He has studied\r\n    beside their broad streams. Steamships have carried him across seas\r\n    and oceans. He has climbed mountains much higher than the Makiling\r\n    of his native province, up to perpetual snow. He has received from\r\n    experience bitter lessons, much more bitter than that sweet\r\n    teaching which his mother gave him. Yet, in spite of all, the man\r\n    still keeps the heart of a child. He still thinks that light is the\r\n    most beautiful thing in creation, and that it is worth a man’s\r\n    sacrificing his life for. [24]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had the soul of an artist, you may perceive, and the artist’s\r\nirresistible yearning for expression. Before he was five years old, and\r\nwithout tutelage or suggestion, he began to draw with pencil and to\r\nmodel in clay and wax. It was form that most took his attention; to\r\nmodel images of birds, butterflies, dogs, and men, to draw faces and to\r\noutline designs. [25] For such studies his surroundings could hardly\r\nhave been better; as soon as his bent was shown father, mother, and\r\nuncles gave him every encouragement; this is a race that upon any\r\nmanifestation of artistic promise looks with a kind of solemn joy.\r\nUncle José Alberto, his mother’s half-brother, had been a\r\nschool-teacher as well as a student abroad; Uncle Gregorio was a great\r\nreader; the atmosphere of the house was friendly to study. After the\r\nPhilippine manner it was grave, decorous, reserved; for there is not on\r\nearth, one may believe, a people by nature more serious-minded. The\r\nfamily was happy to have the benignant friendship of Father Lopez, the\r\nparish priest, a fair antithesis of the typical friar of those days and\r\na noble inheritor of the purest spirit of the first missions. Father\r\nLopez was beloved of all the children of the parish. They had sound\r\nreason for their affection; there was no kinder or more useful man. The\r\nfriendship he maintained with José seemed more like a page out of\r\nCharles Dickens than the barren realities of ordinary child life in the\r\nPhilippines, and the priest to have stepped from some new and Spanish\r\nversion of “Christmas Stories.” The boy was to learn by painful\r\nexperience how different from certain others of the cloth was the\r\ngentle old curate of Calamba.\r\n\r\nYears afterward, when he was entering upon man’s estate, he was induced\r\nto write what he called the story of his boyhood. It proved to be a\r\njuiceless sketch of a few pages covering many years. He was not enough\r\negotist to make a good autobiographer. He begins by saying he was born\r\na few days before the full of the moon. Then he adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I had some slight notions of the morning sun and of my parents.\r\n    That is as much as I can recall of my baby days.\r\n\r\n    The training I received from my earliest infancy is perhaps what\r\n    formed my habits, just as a cask keeps the odor of its first\r\n    contents. I recall clearly my first gloomy nights, passed on the\r\n    azotea [26] of our house. They seem as yesterday! They were nights\r\n    filled with the poetry of sadness and seem near now because at\r\n    present my days are so sad.\r\n\r\n    On moonlight nights, I took my supper on the azotea. My nurse, who\r\n    was very fond of me, used to threaten to leave me to a terrible but\r\n    imaginary being like the bogy of the Europeans if I did not eat.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had nine sisters and one brother. Of his father he says that he was\r\na model parent. [27] “He gave us the education that was suitable to a\r\nfamily neither rich nor poor. Through careful economy, he had been able\r\nto build a stone house.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    At nightfall, my mother had us all say our prayers together. Then\r\n    we would go to the azotea, or to a window from which we could see\r\n    the moon. There my nurse would tell us stories. Sometimes sad and\r\n    sometimes gay, they were always oriental in their imagination. Dead\r\n    people, gold and plants on which diamonds grew were all mixed\r\n    together.\r\n\r\n    When I was four years of age, I lost my little sister, Concha, and\r\n    for the first time my tears fell because of love and sorrow. Till\r\n    then I had shed them only for my own faults. These my loving,\r\n    prudent mother well knew how to correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe environment would seem nevertheless to be more propitious for the\r\nbreeding of an agitator than of either a moralist or an artist. “Almost\r\nevery day in our town,” he says, “we saw the Guardia Civil lieutenant\r\ncaning or injuring some unarmed and inoffensive villager. The only\r\nfault would be that while at a distance he had not taken off his hat\r\nand made his bow. The alcalde did the same thing whenever he visited\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    We saw no restraint put upon brutality. Those whose duty it was to\r\n    look out for the public peace committed acts of violence and other\r\n    excesses. They were the real outlaws, and against such lawbreakers\r\n    our authorities were powerless.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis father looked carefully to the beginnings of José’s education.\r\nThere was daily drilling in all the elementary studies; an old man came\r\nand lived in the house to teach the boy Latin.\r\n\r\nWhen he was nine years old he was sent to the boys’ school at Biñan,\r\nwhere his uncle José Alberto lived, and where he acquired knowledge in\r\nthe traditional manner and under a liberal application of the rod. Dr.\r\nJustiniano Cruz, his teacher, seems to have had no modern illusions\r\nabout the sparing of this implement; to have it hang by the side of the\r\nBible and be more frequently used was his notion of thorough\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nJosé wrote of his experiences there:\r\n\r\n\r\n    My brother left me after he had presented me to the schoolmaster,\r\n    who, it seemed, had been his own teacher. He was a tall, thin man,\r\n    with a long neck and a sharp nose. His body leaned slightly\r\n    forward. His shirt was of sinamay, [28] woven by the deft fingers\r\n    of Batangas women. He knew Latin and Spanish grammar by heart. And\r\n    his severity, I believe now, was too great. This is all I can\r\n    remember of him. His class-room was in his own house and only some\r\n    thirty meters away from my aunt’s house [where José was lodged].\r\n\r\n    When I entered the class-room for the first time, he said to me:\r\n\r\n    “You, do you speak Spanish?”\r\n\r\n    “A little, sir,” I answered.\r\n\r\n    “Do you know Latin?”\r\n\r\n    “A little, sir,” I again answered.\r\n\r\n    Because of these answers, the teacher’s son, who was the worst boy\r\n    in the class, began to make fun of me. He was some years my elder\r\n    and had an advantage in height, yet we had a tussle. Somehow or\r\n    other, I don’t know how, I got the better of him. I bent him down\r\n    over the class benches. Then I let him loose, having hurt only his\r\n    pride.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this feat, the other boys thought he was a clever wrestler. One of\r\nthem challenged him. His pride had an early fall. The challenger threw\r\nhim and came near to break his head on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I do not wish to take up the time with telling of the beatings I\r\n    got, nor shall I attempt to say how it hurt when I received the\r\n    first ruler-blow on my hand. I used to win in the competitions, for\r\n    no one happened to be better than I. Of these successes I made the\r\n    most. In spite of the reputation I had of being a good boy, rare\r\n    were the days in which my teacher did not call me up to receive\r\n    five or six blows on the hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was near-by an aged painter. José used to haunt his studio and\r\nlearned much there about the secrets of pictorial art. He continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n    My manner of life was simple. I heard mass at four if there was a\r\n    service so early, or studied my lesson at that hour and went to\r\n    mass afterward. Then I went into the yard and looked for mabolos.\r\n    [29] Then came breakfast, which generally consisted of a plate of\r\n    rice and two dried sardines. There was class-work till ten o’clock,\r\n    and after luncheon a study period. In the afternoon there was\r\n    school from two o’clock until five. Next, there would be play with\r\n    my cousins for a while. Study and perhaps painting took up the\r\n    remainder of the afternoon. By and by came supper, one or two\r\n    plates of rice with a fish called ayungin. In the evening we had\r\n    prayers and then, if there was moonlight, a cousin and I would play\r\n    in the street with the others. Fortunately, I was never ill while\r\n    away from home. From time to time, I went to my own village. How\r\n    long the trip seemed going and how short coming back!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tenderer plants of knowledge would hardly be expected to flower in\r\nthis harsh air, but the boy acquitted himself well. In two years he had\r\ngathered into his little head all the wisdom Dr. Cruz could supply,\r\neven with the conscientious use of the birch, and his parents had\r\ndecided to send him to Manila and the famous Ateneo Municipal of the\r\nJesuits. [30]\r\n\r\nIn Manila, though not at the Ateneo, he had been preceded by his elder\r\nbrother Paciano, long a student at the College of San José, where that\r\nFather Burgos, whose death at the hands of the terrified governing\r\nclass in 1872 we have recounted, was an instructor. Paciano lived at\r\nFather Burgos’s house and was his intimate friend. What ideas and\r\nideals dominated the Mercado household at Calamba we may surmise from\r\nincidents of Paciano’s own school life. He was pilloried at San José as\r\na notorious patriot; because he spoke with some freedom against the\r\ntyranny that blasted his country the authorities refused to allow him\r\nto pass his examinations. [31] It appears that Father Burgos, although\r\nunjustly accused of complicity in the Cavite affair, was likewise a\r\nsturdy Filipino and convinced that the iniquities of the existing\r\nSystem could not long be maintained. In all probability he was\r\nsentenced for holding these views. No one will ever know this, because\r\nthe trial was in secret, no testimony (if any was taken) was afterward\r\nto be found, and he that was called the witness for the Government was\r\ngarroted by that same Government before the public could learn the\r\nnature of his inventions. [32] A belief that Father Burgos was a\r\ngeneral-principles victim is justified by the habitual proceedings of\r\nthe Government. He was not the only man that perished in those days for\r\nwhat he thought and not for what he did.\r\n\r\nThe slayings of Fathers Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora took place a few\r\nmonths before José Rizal went to Manila. Almost before Paciano’s face\r\nhis friend and teacher had been dragged to death. What communication\r\nabout these things Paciano made to his brother, or how Paciano was\r\nmoved by the tragedy, we can gather only from what happened afterward;\r\nbut what it meant to José we know well, for as to that he has left\r\neloquent testimony. Sixteen years afterward he compressed into\r\ntwenty-two lines of bitter irony the scorn he had of Spain for that\r\nday’s work. The tragedy on Bagumbayan Field came at the time when his\r\nmother’s persecution was beginning; his departure from home had been\r\ndelayed by her arrest. He was already burning under the sense of an\r\nintolerable wrong; this sharp and gratuitous access of injustice must\r\nhave pierced him with another wound to brood over. [33] All the rest of\r\nhis life he seemed a lonely and rather melancholy figure. It was here\r\nat the Ateneo that his aloofness began. A feeling grew upon him that he\r\nwas alone in the midst of crowds. It was the counterpart of a sense\r\nequally developing in him that the misfortunes of his people were to be\r\nthe business of his life.\r\n\r\nHe found much at the Ateneo that sharpened his observations of the\r\nsource of the national disease. All things considered, the school\r\nprofessed unusual virtues; its wise conductors made something of a\r\nvaunt of equal treatment for all their pupils. Yet even so it was\r\nimpossible to shut out or to mitigate the contempt and hatred the\r\nSpaniards had for the Filipinos. Before the faculty, Spanish boys and\r\nFilipino boys might have an equal chance to pass their examinations;\r\noutside of the class-rooms, the Spanish boys sedulously imitated the\r\narrogance and brutalities of their elders. One of the first remarks\r\nmade by José Rizal in his new academe was that the Spanish boys always\r\nbore themselves with aggressive insolence toward their schoolmates of\r\ndarker skin; the “miserable Indio” attitude over again. The next was\r\nthat while the Filipino boys seemed as a rule to accept a situation\r\nthey were powerless to end, they were one and all insubmissive in their\r\nhearts. Next he made note that the Filipino boys were so little\r\nimpressed with Spanish superiority that in secret they laughed at their\r\nwhite tyrants, mocking them and well aware of their faults and\r\nweaknesses. Finally, he satisfied himself many times in many ways, that\r\nthe Filipino mind was not in any respect inferior to the Spanish; for\r\nthe pretense of Spanish superiority there was no other basis but the\r\naccident of the overawing military.\r\n\r\nIn cannon and not in mind, spirit, or genius lay all of Spain’s\r\nprestige.\r\n\r\nBefore this discovery all the theory upon which Europe dominated any\r\npart of the Orient crumbled and vanished. There was no such thing, it\r\ndid not exist, it was only fabrication and device. The brown man was\r\nnot inferior; he was not deliberately shaped by the Creator to be the\r\nwhite man’s patient drudge. Put down side by side with an equal course\r\nbefore them, footing the same starting-line, the brown boy in school\r\nwon to the goal as quickly and surely as the white. And only as quickly\r\nand surely? It seemed to Rizal, after a time, taking careful note, that\r\nthe brown boy was in every trial heat the nimbler and wiser. [34] As,\r\nfor example, here was all the instruction in this school given in\r\nSpanish, the white boy’s native tongue, but all alien to the brown boy.\r\nSo, then, the brown boy must needs compass the language in which the\r\ninstruction was conveyed as well as the instruction given therein. Yet,\r\neven so, handicapped by this and no less by universal contempt and\r\ndisparagement, behold him winning at least as many prizes as the\r\nSpaniard, at least as proficient, diligent, capable.\r\n\r\nHere was a revelation to shake the towers of accepted doctrine. In the\r\nlight of it how great (and how hideous!) was the wrong done to the\r\npeople of the Philippines! The pretense upon which Spain ruled in this\r\niron fashion, with so much cruelty and dishonesty, was (in effect) that\r\nin the cells of the brains and in the corpuscles of the blood of these\r\npeople some undefined and mysterious essence was lacking, and for want\r\nof this they were incapable of ruling themselves or even of taking a\r\nplace among the other children of earth. Being put to the test, no such\r\nlack appeared, but only aptitude, mental health, mental vigor, equal at\r\nleast to those of the white man. The European ruled, then, because he\r\nhad a larger share of the brute in him, because he had a sensual\r\nambition to rule, because his taste found pleasure in humiliating and\r\nexploiting others, because he had a tougher conscience, and because\r\nluck had been on his side. Of any essential, irradicable, structural\r\ndifference between race and race there was not an indication. What the\r\nAsiatic really lacked was opportunity, not intellect; and liberty, not\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHe came to these conclusions without haste, because his was a mind that\r\nworked deliberately and over stretched-out periods of observation. He\r\nhas left a record of them: of the time when they caused him to believe\r\nthat the Malayan mind must really be better than the Caucasian; of his\r\nfinal conviction that between mind and mind there is no racial\r\ndistinction with which reasoning men will bother themselves; that all\r\nthe children of mother earth under the same conditions will average\r\nabout the same results. In the end he came to discard the whole theory\r\nof races; to his mind it was nothing but the manufacture of prejudice,\r\nignorance, or profit-mongering. Mankind he saw not separated by\r\nperpendicular lines into races but by horizontal lines into strata.\r\n[35] Everywhere some groups of men, favored by conditions, by liberty\r\nfirst of all, by institutions, by opportunity, had climbed to higher\r\nstrata; everywhere other groups of men less fortunate as to conditions,\r\nhaving less liberty, worse institutions, and narrower opportunity,\r\nremained still in the lower strata. But everywhere it was, first of\r\nall, conditions that determined whether men should climb or remain, and\r\nnot blood nor the color of skin nor the texture of hair.\r\n\r\nIt appears that he would make full allowance for individuals of unusual\r\ngifts, for the Shakespeares and Hugos, Goethes and Voltaires. What he\r\nwas considering was men in the mass, not individuals. If we may judge\r\nfrom his writings and the testimony of his friends he was singularly\r\nfree from vanity; certainly from the little vanities of self-seekers.\r\nHe could hardly have failed to perceive even then that he himself was\r\nof the order of the exceptional; at the same time he saw plainly enough\r\nthat his own attainments were won by hard and systematic toil rather\r\nthan the rare blessings of the gods dropped into his lap. Still looking\r\nupon men in the mass, he saw that to assign special qualities as\r\nspecial inheritances out of the reach of other complexions was wrong in\r\nscience and foolish in practice. One race could not possibly inherit\r\nthe right to rule another; one race could not possibly be dearer than\r\nanother to the Omnipotence that he believed had created all.\r\n\r\nEquality, then, was not a dream of enthusiasts, like those of France;\r\nequality was the scientific fact. Liberty was not a rare chrism with\r\nwhich were touched the lips of a few peoples set apart by their\r\ncomplexions for this distinction; liberty was the indefeasible right of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nManila, Philippine Islands, year 1876—this was. He found nothing in the\r\ntext-books put into his hands then that bred any of these ideas; above\r\nall, there was nothing of the kind in the tuition he was receiving.\r\nWhen he was a student at the Ateneo and later at the University of\r\nSanto Tomas, the trend of thought there and elsewhere ran all the other\r\nway. By his own mental processes he had worked out, when he was hardly\r\nmore than a boy, the theory to which gray-beard science was to come a\r\nfew years later. What he felt then the best schools teach now; a fact\r\nthat if there were nothing else would establish his precocity. But we\r\nare to remember that he had formed early a habit of independent\r\nthinking and had been stimulated to form it. This accounts for much.\r\nWalls of convention that shut in upon and crushed the intellectual\r\nmachinery of so many other youths (there and elsewhere) had no terrors\r\nfor him; despite all weight of eminent authority he would at all times\r\nand on all subjects think for himself. To be thus erect intellectually\r\nin a university, even of these days and in these nations of ours\r\nabreast with the front line of human advance, is still not so easy that\r\nwe fail to mark it if ever we find it. In his day, in his nation, then\r\nintellectually dragged along at the moldering chariot-wheels of antique\r\nformality, behold a marvel and no less.\r\n\r\nThis habitual attitude of mind was a great asset in his make-up—the\r\ncomplete intellectual emancipation of the querist that will take\r\nnothing for granted, but without bias or passion will investigate,\r\nconsider, weigh, seek, and decide. Being without feeling, it was\r\ncuriously counterpoised against another asset that was all feeling,\r\ndeep and real. His mind might climb into abstraction’s chilly heights;\r\nhis heart would be hot for Filipinas. He was an example of that\r\nenlightened patriotism that has redeemed the word from its cheap and\r\nreactionary definitions. It was no mere instinct of attachment to the\r\nwalls wherein he was born that moved him, the instinct that causes\r\ngoats to come home and cows to low when they are sold. He saw a people\r\nof whom he was a member bowed under monstrous injustice, denied the\r\nbirthright of opportunity, slandered by oppressors, and contemned by a\r\nworld that took these slanderous inventions for a true coinage. In a\r\nsoul that worshiped justice and loved equity, he revolted against these\r\nabominations, as it was certain he would have revolted against the same\r\nwrongs practised against another people.\r\n\r\nNot in the same degree; for at home the brand had been thrust deep into\r\nhim. He might not even have come, so far in advance of his time, upon\r\nthe modern theory of races if he had not started with a sense of\r\nresentment against the suffering of his own. But when he had satisfied\r\nhimself of the truth of his theory, he naturally applied it to his own\r\npeople and felt more than ever the yoke that galled and hobbled them.\r\nIf the Filipino was not in fact made of different stuff from the marl\r\nthat made up the white man; if he was held in subjection not because he\r\nwas inferior in capacity but because he was shouldered out of his due\r\nshare of the world’s light and hope, again how much more terrible was\r\nhis plight! An aspiring soul, as fine and sure as any other, held as a\r\nbrother to the ox, Rizal began to perceive even in those early days\r\nthat the Filipinos were like a river that some great arbitrary force\r\nhad closed in and dammed back. He could see the water rising and hear\r\nit struggling, and knew that some time it would break through the\r\nbarriers and run its due course. To his thinking, the real powers of\r\nhis people were latent, but of a kind the world would have to admit\r\nwhen these powers should be set free. And what should set them free?\r\n\r\nEducation and political liberty.\r\n\r\nIt has become a habit among some writers and speakers to look upon\r\nRizal as a kind of superman, a creature of abnormal gifts, a brilliant\r\nexception to the common endowment of the Filipino. Some have described\r\nhim as a bright, strange meteor flashing against a background of\r\nMalayan incapacity. [36] As this narrative of a wonderful life unfolds\r\nit will probably show that the man thus pedestaled was only human and\r\nthat the secret of his great works, enduring influence and pre-eminence\r\nin so many walks was nothing mysterious but plainly understandable. He\r\nhad a twofold inspiration. First, he developed a habit of ceaseless\r\nindustry, carefully ordered, carefully followed. Second, and even\r\nbetter than this, from his youth he had been overmastered, fired and\r\nwhirled along by a vision of his people redeemed. So then to their\r\nredemption he consecrated his life. He did it in his closet, quietly,\r\nwithout theatrics and without telling anybody. Macaulay’s theory that\r\nevery great man has something of the charlatan in him falls short in\r\nthis instance. For him the grand stand never existed. Whatever he did\r\nwas dedicated first in his heart to Filipinas; whatever he thought,\r\nplanned, dreamed, or hoped for had some reference to her and her\r\nservice, and now when he studied it was to fit himself to serve her\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nWe come back to him, knocking at the gate of Ateneo, eleven years old,\r\nsmall for his age, and all a boy still; for we have shot far ahead of\r\nthat day to deal with the development of the ideas of which he was\r\nslowly possessed. It was not with a head full of philosophy that he\r\nmade his application to the famous school, but, as he tells us in his\r\nshort notes on his life, a heart full of misgivings. The day was June\r\n10, 1872, and he was to take his entrance examinations at the College\r\nof San Juan de Letran, Manila. Christian doctrine, arithmetic, and\r\nreading were the branches of human erudition required of youth that\r\nsought to enter those doors. It is to be supposed that José could have\r\npassed them with his eyes shut. He received the required mark and spent\r\nthe next few days at home. When he returned to Manila to begin his\r\nstudies at the Ateneo, “even then,” he says, “I felt that unhappiness\r\nwas in store for me.” [37]\r\n\r\nFor all his good passing-mark, he came near to miss the opening he\r\nsought. Father Fernando, the Jesuit priest then in charge of the\r\nAteneo, looked upon him without favor. He had come late in the term,\r\nfor one thing; and then he was so small and slight. Only at the\r\nintercession of Dr. Manuel Burgos, a nephew of the priest officially\r\nmurdered on Bagumbayan Field, the rules were relaxed and the midget\r\nfrom Calamba allowed to come in. For the moment he forgot his\r\nforebodings. With joy he put on the school uniform, the white coat\r\ncalled an americana, the necktie, and the rest. When he found himself\r\nin the chapel of the Jesuit fathers to hear mass, surrounded with\r\nstrange faces, a new boy in a new school, he prayed fervently. Then he\r\nsays he went to the class-room and appraised his teachers and\r\nschool-fellows, on whom he seems to have looked with preternaturally\r\nkeen eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Father José Bech was a tall man, thin and somewhat stooping, but\r\n    quick in his movements. His face was ascetic, yet animated. The\r\n    eyes were small and sunken, the nose sharp and Grecian. His thin\r\n    lips curved downward. He was a little eccentric, at times being out\r\n    of humor and intolerant and at other times amusing himself by\r\n    playing like a child.\r\n\r\n    Some of my schoolmates were interesting enough to warrant\r\n    mentioning them by name. A boy, or rather a young man from my own\r\n    province, Florencio Gavino Oliva, was of exceptional talents but\r\n    only average application. The same was true of Moisés Santiago. He\r\n    was a mathematician and penman. Also it was true of Gonzalo\r\n    Manzano. The last named then held the position of Roman Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title seems incongruous, but Rizal explains that to stimulate the\r\nboys in Jesuit colleges the custom was to divide them into two\r\n“empires,” one Roman, the other Carthaginian or Greek. These were\r\ncontinually at war—academic. The battles fought were in the class-room,\r\nover recitations. Points were scored by discovering errors in the work\r\nof the hated foe. Rizal was placed at the bottom of the cohorts of one\r\nof these “empires,” a private in the rear ranks. Within a month he was\r\nemperor; he had outstripped everybody else.\r\n\r\nPaciano was there that first day and took him in charge. He would not\r\nallow the sensitive little artist to lodge in the Walled City or\r\nancient part of Manila, “which seemed very gloomy to me,” says Rizal, a\r\njudgment others might echo. In another quarter of the town, twenty-five\r\nminutes away, he was lodged with an old maid, who seemed to have a\r\nsuperfluity of other lodgers and a scarcity of room to stow them in. “I\r\nmust not speak of my sufferings,” says José, with pious resignation.\r\n[38]\r\n\r\nThe Ateneo was not an easy school in which to gain distinction or to\r\nwin favor; Rizal speedily achieved both. By the end of the first week\r\nhe was going up in his class. In a month he had captured his first\r\nprize and seems to have looked upon it with rapture. At the end of the\r\nfirst quarter he had won another prize and the grade of “excellent.” He\r\nconfesses that for the rest of that year he did not care to apply\r\nhimself. He had taken on a boyish resentment to something a teacher had\r\nsaid, he explains. Possibly he was not yet inured to the prevailing\r\nmethod of driving instruction into the heads of the young with the aid\r\nof sarcasm and shouts. At the end of the year he says as if with a kind\r\nof sigh, “I had only second place in all my subjects.” He received the\r\ngrade of “excellent” but no prizes, and the lack seems to have goaded\r\nhim to remorse.\r\n\r\nIt must have been efficacious, for when he returned to school he flung\r\nhimself with something like passion into the race for these laurels,\r\nand it was said of him that no student there had ever equaled his\r\nperformance. The fathers began to look with wondering pride upon this\r\npremier medal winner. For all that, he was a boy still and no mere\r\nJohnny Dighard; he had fights and he read novels and he even found time\r\nfor social amenities, so called. At these latter he seems not to have\r\nwon distinction, though the records are meager; but at least it may be\r\nsaid for him that he managed to fall in love. [39] One of the first\r\nworks of fiction he read was Dumas’s “Count of Monte Christo” in\r\nSpanish. He says that it gave him “delight,” but it did more than that\r\nfor him. The wrongs and sufferings of Edmond Dantes bore in upon him\r\nthe misfortunes of his own people and sharply reminded him of his\r\nmother and the two terrible years she had spent in Santa Cruz jail. In\r\nCalamba and all about him festered a social system infinitely worse\r\nthan any Dumas had imagined.\r\n\r\nAbout this time he began to lay out his days into a schedule of hours\r\nto which he aimed rigidly to adhere; so many hours for study, so many\r\nfor reading; from four to five, exercise; five to six, something else.\r\nThis was a plan he followed, or tried to follow, all the rest of his\r\nlife, and accounts in part for that list of achievements that still\r\nstaggers the investigators. It was strict economy of time and likewise\r\nan exercise in self-mastery, a virtue on which he set great store and\r\nin the practice of which few men outside of monastery walls have\r\nequaled him. He came to look upon his body as a kind of mechanism with\r\nwhich, as its master, he could do as he pleased; feed it, starve it, or\r\nrun races with it. At the Ateneo he held it in subjection while he\r\naccumulated medals, fought when necessary, and composed treatises in\r\nchemistry, which, next to poetry and sculpture, had become his\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFIRST CONTACTS WITH THE ENEMY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the times and the place the Ateneo was a good school, by general\r\nconsent the best in the Islands, in some respects matching well with an\r\ninferior preparatory school in America. When the Jesuits were allowed\r\nto return to the country from which they had been banished, they\r\nbrought with them new ideas of education into a region where for two\r\nhundred years such imports had been rare. For all that, education at\r\nthe Ateneo was not to be had except at the price of a struggle. There\r\nwas no suggestion there, at least, of Tennyson’s idea of a row of empty\r\npates and kindly Instruction tumbling in the sciences. A student like\r\nRizal, reputed in his second year to be the hardest working in the\r\ninstitution, seemed like a soldier fighting in doubtful trenches;\r\neducation to be won, as it were, by hand-to-hand conflict. Years\r\nafterward Rizal wrote in his own vivid style a description of the\r\nmanner in which wisdom was imparted in even the highest Philippine seat\r\nof learning, from which wonder grows to amazement that there were in\r\nthose days any educated Filipinos. It reveals them again as of iron\r\nwill and unmatchable persistence. No such dogged resolution in chase of\r\nknowledge is now required of any people; the pursuit of learning under\r\ndifficulties, it may well be called. A Filipino reading it now may be\r\nexcused if he is moved somewhat to hold up his head among the nations.\r\nEvery fact that one of his countrymen added to his store he must wrest\r\nfrom the hard hands of prejudice and desperate chance.\r\n\r\nAs to this, the Ateneo was not so bad as the rest, but bad enough.\r\nWithin even its halls was as yet no emancipation from the notion that\r\nthe student is the scum of the earth and the professor sent to scourge\r\nand chasten him. At Santo Tomas, whither Rizal was later transferred,\r\nthis variant of purgatory was at its worst; tuition dwelt in the Lower\r\nSilurian. Rizal’s description is of the session of a class in physics.\r\nThe discerning reader will conclude that it is the transcript of a\r\npersonal experience:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The class-room was a spacious rectangular hall with large grated\r\n    windows that admitted an abundance of light and air. Along the two\r\n    sides extended three wide tiers of stone covered with wood, filled\r\n    with students arranged in alphabetical order. At the end opposite\r\n    the entrance, under a print of St. Thomas Aquinas, rose the\r\n    professor’s chair on a level platform with a little stairway on\r\n    each side. With the exception of a beautiful blackboard in a narra\r\n    [wood] frame, scarcely ever used, since there was still written on\r\n    it the viva that had appeared on the opening day, no furniture,\r\n    either useful or useless, was to be seen. The walls, painted white\r\n    and covered with glazed tiles, to prevent scratches, were entirely\r\n    bare, having neither a drawing nor a picture, nor even an outline\r\n    of any physical apparatus. The students had no need of any; no one\r\n    missed the practical instruction in an extremely experimental\r\n    science; for years and years it has been so taught, and the country\r\n    has not been upset but continues just as ever. Now and then some\r\n    little instrument descended from heaven and was exhibited to the\r\n    class from a distance, like the monstrance to the prostrate\r\n    worshipers—look, but touch not! From time to time when some\r\n    complacent professor appeared, one day in the year was set aside\r\n    for visiting the mysterious laboratory and gazing from without at\r\n    the puzzling apparatus arranged in glass cases. No one could\r\n    complain, for on that day there were to be seen quantities of brass\r\n    and glassware, tubes, disks, wheels, bells, and the like—the\r\n    exhibition did not get beyond that, and the country was not\r\n    upset....\r\n\r\n    This was the professor who that morning called the roll and\r\n    directed many of the students to recite the lesson from memory,\r\n    word for word. The phonographs got into operation, some well, some\r\n    ill, some stammering, and received their grades. He who recited\r\n    without an error earned a good mark, and he who made more than\r\n    three mistakes a bad mark.\r\n\r\n    A fat boy with a sleepy face and hair as stiff and hard as the\r\n    bristles of a brush yawned until he seemed about to dislocate his\r\n    jaws, and stretched himself with his arms extended as if he were in\r\n    his bed. The professor saw this and wished to startle him.\r\n\r\n    “Eh, there, sleepy-head! What’s this? Lazy, too; so it’s sure you\r\n    don’t know the lesson, ha?”\r\n\r\n    This question, instead of offending the class, amused them and many\r\n    laughed; it was a daily occurrence. But the sleeper did not laugh;\r\n    he arose and, with a bound, rubbed his eyes, and, as if a\r\n    steam-engine were turning the phonograph, began to recite:\r\n\r\n    “The name of mirror is applied to all polished surfaces intended to\r\n    produce by the reflection of light the images of the objects placed\r\n    before said surfaces. From the substance that forms these surfaces\r\n    they are divided into metallic mirrors and glass mirrors——”\r\n\r\n    “Stop, stop, stop!” interrupted the professor. “Heavens, what a\r\n    rattle! We were at the point where the mirrors are divided into\r\n    metallic and glass, eh? Now if I should present to you a block of\r\n    wood, a piece of kamagon for instance, well polished and varnished,\r\n    or a slab of black marble well burnished, or a square of jet, which\r\n    would reflect the images of objects placed before them, how would\r\n    you classify those mirrors?”\r\n\r\n    Whether he did not know what to answer or did not understand the\r\n    question, the student tried to get out of the difficulty by\r\n    demonstrating that he knew the lesson; so he rushed on like a\r\n    torrent:\r\n\r\n    “The first are composed of brass or an alloy of different metals,\r\n    and the second of a sheet of glass, with its two sides well\r\n    polished, one of which has an amalgam of tin adhering to it.”\r\n\r\n    “Tut, tut, tut! That’s not it! I say to you, ‘Dominus vobiscum,’\r\n    and you answer me with, ‘Requiescat in pace!’”\r\n\r\n    The worthy professor then repeated the question in the vernacular\r\n    of the markets, interspersed with cosas and abás at every moment.\r\n\r\n    The poor youth did not know how to get out of the quandary; he\r\n    doubted whether to include kamagon with the metals, or the marble\r\n    with the glasses, and leave the jet as a neutral substance, until\r\n    Juanito Pelaez maliciously prompted him:\r\n\r\n    “The mirror of kamagon among the wooden mirrors.”\r\n\r\n    The incautious youth repeated this aloud, and half the class was\r\n    convulsed with laughter.\r\n\r\n    “A good sample of wood you are yourself!” exclaimed the professor,\r\n    laughing in spite of himself. “Let’s see from what you would define\r\n    a mirror—from a substance per se, in quantum est superficies, or\r\n    from the substance upon which the surface rests, the raw material,\r\n    modified by the attribute ‘surface,’ since it is clear that,\r\n    surface being an accidental property of bodies, it cannot exist\r\n    without substance—what do you say?”\r\n\r\n    “I? Nothing!” the wretched boy was about to reply, for he did not\r\n    understand what it was all about, confused as he was by so many\r\n    surfaces and so many accidents that smote cruelly on his ears, but\r\n    a sense of shame restrained him. Filled with anguish and breaking\r\n    into a cold perspiration, he began to repeat between his teeth:\r\n    “The name of mirror is applied to all polished surfaces——”\r\n\r\n    “Ergo, per te, the mirror is the surface,” angled the professor.\r\n    “Well, then, clear up this difficulty. If the surface is the\r\n    mirror, it must be of no consequence to the ‘essence’ of the mirror\r\n    what may be found behind this surface, since what is behind it does\r\n    not affect the ‘essence’ that is before it, id est, the surface,\r\n    quae super faciem est, quia vocatur superficies, facies ea quae\r\n    supra videtur. Do you admit that or do you not admit it?”\r\n\r\n    The poor youth’s hair stood up straighter than ever, as though\r\n    acted upon by some magnetic force.\r\n\r\n    “Do you admit it or do you not admit it?”\r\n\r\n    “Anything! Whatever you wish, Padre,” was his thought, but he did\r\n    not dare to express it from fear of ridicule. That was a dilemma\r\n    indeed and he had never been in a worse one. He had a vague idea\r\n    that the most innocent thing could not be admitted to the friars\r\n    but that they, or rather their estates and curacies, would get out\r\n    of it all the results and advantages imaginable. So his good angel\r\n    prompted him to deny everything with all the energy of his soul and\r\n    refractoriness of his hair, and he was about to shout a proud nego,\r\n    for the reason that he who denies everything does not compromise\r\n    himself in anything, as a certain lawyer had once told him; but the\r\n    evil habits of disregarding the dictates of one’s own conscience,\r\n    of having little faith in legal folk, and of seeking aid from\r\n    others where one is sufficient unto himself were his undoing. His\r\n    companions, especially Juanito Pelaez, were making signs to him to\r\n    admit it, so he let himself be carried away by his evil destiny and\r\n    exclaimed, “Concedo, Padre,” in a voice as faltering as if he were\r\n    saying, “In manus tuas commendo spiritum meum.”\r\n\r\n    “Concedo antecedentem,” echoed the professor, smiling maliciously.\r\n    “Ergo, I can scratch the mercury off a looking-glass, put in its\r\n    place a piece of bibinka, and we shall still have a mirror, eh? Now\r\n    what shall we have?”...\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother pupil is questioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “What’s your name?” the professor asked him.\r\n\r\n    “Placido,” was the curt reply.\r\n\r\n    “Aha! Placido Penitente, although you look more like Placido the\r\n    Prompter—or the Prompted. But, Penitent, I’m going to impose some\r\n    penance on you for your promptings.”\r\n\r\n    Pleased with his play on words, he ordered the youth to recite the\r\n    lesson; and the latter, in the state of mind to which he was\r\n    reduced, made more than three mistakes. Shaking his head up and\r\n    down, the professor slowly opened the register and slowly scanned\r\n    it while he called off the names in a low voice.\r\n\r\n    “Palencia—Paloma—Panganiban—Pedraza—Pelado—Pelaez—Penitente, aha!\r\n    Placido Penitente, fifteen unexcused absences——”\r\n\r\n    Placido started up. “Fifteen absences, Padre?”\r\n\r\n    “Fifteen unexcused absences,” continued the professor, “so that you\r\n    only lack one to be dropped from the roll.”\r\n\r\n    “Fifteen absences, fifteen absences,” repeated Placido in\r\n    amazement. “I have never been absent more than four times, and,\r\n    with to-day, perhaps five.”\r\n\r\n    “Jesso, jesso, monseer,” [40] replied the professor, examining the\r\n    youth over his gold eye-glasses. “You confess that you have missed\r\n    five times, and God knows if you have missed oftener. Atqui, as I\r\n    rarely call the roll, every time I catch any one I put five marks\r\n    against him; ergo, how many are five times five? Have you forgotten\r\n    the multiplication-table? Five times five?”\r\n\r\n    “Twenty-five.”\r\n\r\n    “Correct, correct! Thus you have still got away with ten, because I\r\n    have caught you only three times. Huh, if I had caught you every\r\n    time—Now how many are three times five?”\r\n\r\n    “Fifteen.”\r\n\r\n    “Fifteen, right you are!” concluded the professor, closing the\r\n    register. “If you miss once more—out of doors with you, get out!\r\n    Ha, now a mark for the failure in the daily lesson.”\r\n\r\n    He again opened the register, sought out the name, and entered the\r\n    mark. “Come, only one mark,” he said, “since you hadn’t any\r\n    before.”\r\n\r\n    “But, Padre,” exclaimed Placido, restraining himself, “if your\r\n    Reverence puts a mark against me for failing in the lesson, your\r\n    Reverence owes it to me to erase the one for absence that you have\r\n    put against me for to-day.”\r\n\r\n    His Reverence made no answer. First, he slowly entered the mark,\r\n    then contemplated it with his head on one side—the mark must be\r\n    artistic—closed the register, and asked with great sarcasm, “Abá,\r\n    and why so, sir?”\r\n\r\n    “Because I can’t conceive, Padre, how one can be absent from the\r\n    class and at the same time recite the lesson in it. Your Reverence\r\n    is saying that to be is not to be.”\r\n\r\n    “Nakú, a metaphysician, but a rather premature one! So you can’t\r\n    conceive of it, eh? Sed patet experientia and contra experientiam\r\n    negantem, fusilibus est arguendum, do you understand? And can’t you\r\n    conceive with your philosophical head that one can be absent from\r\n    the class and not know the lesson at the same time? Is it a fact\r\n    that absence necessarily implies knowledge? What do you say to\r\n    that, philosophaster?”\r\n\r\n    This last epithet was the drop of water that made the full cup\r\n    overflow. Placido enjoyed among his friends the reputation of being\r\n    a philosopher, so he lost his patience, threw down his book, arose,\r\n    and faced the professor.\r\n\r\n    “Enough, Padre, enough! Your Reverence can put all the marks\r\n    against me that you wish, but you haven’t the right to insult me.\r\n    Your Reverence may stay with the class; I can’t stand any more.”\r\n    Without further farewell, he stalked away.\r\n\r\n    The class was astounded; such an assumption of dignity had scarcely\r\n    ever been seen, and who would have thought it of Placido Penitente?\r\n    The surprised professor bit his lips and shook his head\r\n    threateningly as he watched him depart. Then in a trembling voice\r\n    he began his preachment on the same old theme, delivered, however,\r\n    with more energy and more eloquence. It dealt with the growing\r\n    arrogance, the innate ingratitude, the presumption, the lack of\r\n    respect for superiors, the pride that the spirit of darkness\r\n    infused in the young, the lack of manners, the absence of courtesy,\r\n    and so on. From this he passed to coarse jest and sarcasm....\r\n\r\n    So he went on with his harangue until the bell rang and the class\r\n    was over. The 234 students, after reciting their prayers, went out\r\n    as ignorant as when they went in, but breathing more freely, as if\r\n    a great weight had been lifted from them. Each youth had lost\r\n    another hour of his life and with it a portion of his dignity and\r\n    self-respect, and in exchange there was an increase of discontent,\r\n    of aversion to study, of resentment in their heart. After all this\r\n    ask for knowledge, dignity, gratitude!\r\n\r\n    Just as the 234 spent their class hours, so the thousands of\r\n    students that preceded them have spent theirs, and, if matters do\r\n    not mend, so will those yet to come spend theirs, and be\r\n    brutalized, while wounded dignity and youthful enthusiasm will be\r\n    converted into hatred and sloth. [41]\r\n\r\n\r\nRizal liked the Ateneo and the Ateneo liked him, students as well as\r\nfathers. His fellows seem to have had for him more of awe than\r\naffection as they contemplated his always growing list of victories. We\r\nmay believe now that the distance that separated them from him was not\r\nso great as they thought, the wizardry of his prize-winning being, next\r\nto his hard work, the advantages of his definite aim. Most men that\r\nacquire this and follow it with any steadiness, whether it be for\r\nwealth, position, or reputation, seem to their contemporaries a kind of\r\ndemon, but if they live, indent the chronicles of their times. The idea\r\nthat seized upon Rizal and was always growing in his thoughts was that\r\nhe ought to do something to help his people out of the prison-house of\r\nignorance and tyranny in which they sat the bound captives of a\r\npreposterous social organization. This was enough to mark him apart\r\nfrom students that went to the Ateneo only because their parents told\r\nthem to go. Good things for him were things that helped him to his\r\npurpose and bad things were things that got across his way.\r\n\r\nLong after he had left those sequestered halls, he put together notes\r\non his recollections of his life at the Ateneo, that, curt as they are,\r\nlight up his views of himself, his peculiar self-abnegation and his\r\nidea of his destiny. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    After the vacation, in that memorable year of my mother’s release,\r\n    I again had my lodgings in the Walled City.... My mother had not\r\n    wanted me to return to Manila, saying that I already had a\r\n    sufficient education. Did she have a presentiment of what was going\r\n    to happen to me? Can it be that a mother’s heart gives her double\r\n    vision?\r\n\r\n    My future profession was still unsettled. My father wanted me to\r\n    study metaphysics, so I enrolled in that course. But my interest\r\n    was so slight that I did not even buy a copy of the text-book. A\r\n    former schoolmate, who had finished his course three months before,\r\n    was my only intimate friend. He lived in the same street that I\r\n    lived in.\r\n\r\n    On Sundays and other holidays, this friend used to call for me and\r\n    we would spend the day at my great-aunt’s house in Trozo. My aunt\r\n    knew his father. When my youngest sister entered La Concordia\r\n    College, I used to visit her, too, on the holidays. Another friend\r\n    had a sister in the same school, so we could go together. I made a\r\n    pencil sketch of his sister from a photograph she lent me. On\r\n    December 8, the festival of La Concordia, some other students and I\r\n    went to the college. It was a fine day, and the building was gay\r\n    with decorations of banners, lanterns, and flowers.\r\n\r\n    Shortly after that I went home for the Christmas holidays. On the\r\n    same steamer was a Calamba girl that had been a pupil in Santa\r\n    Catalina College for nearly five years. Her father was with her. We\r\n    were well acquainted, but her schooling had made her bashful. She\r\n    kept her back to me while we talked. To help her pass the time, I\r\n    asked about her school and studies, but I got hardly more than\r\n    “yes” and “no” answers. She seemed to have almost, if not entirely,\r\n    forgotten her Tagalog. When I walked into our house in Calamba, my\r\n    mother at first did not recognize me. The sad cause was that she\r\n    had almost lost her sight. My sisters greeted me joyfully, and I\r\n    could read their welcome in their smiling faces. But my father, who\r\n    seemed to be the most pleased of all, said least....\r\n\r\n    There I tied the horse by the roadside and for a time watched the\r\n    water flowing through the irrigation ditch. Its swiftness reminded\r\n    me how rapidly my days were going by. I am now twenty years old and\r\n    have the satisfaction of remembering that in the crises of my life\r\n    I have not followed my own pleasure. I have always tried to live by\r\n    my principles and to do the heavy duties I have undertaken. [42]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instructor at the Ateneo that Rizal chiefly liked was Father\r\nGuerrico, a kindly, gentle, devout old man, full of learning and given\r\nto good works. Long after swift and stirring events in the great world\r\nhad dimmed the memory of other faces at the Ateneo, the visage of\r\nFather Guerrico, furrowed with thought, yet beaming with good will to\r\nall mankind, was clear before Rizal, and with that marvelous gift of\r\nhis for sculpture he made, out of his lingering recollections, a bust\r\nof the father, achieving a likeness of extraordinary quality, so subtly\r\ncharged it is with the feeling of truth that confers life upon\r\nportraiture. But there is, indeed, no room to doubt his high artistic\r\ncalling; if to painting or to sculpture he had cared to devote himself,\r\nhe would have been one of the world figures of his day. When one so\r\ngifted and having also the artist’s craving for expression and\r\nachievement makes of these a sacrifice for the general welfare, it may\r\nbe doubted if rack or prison mean much more.\r\n\r\nSculpture came as easily to him as laughter to a child. From his\r\nbabyhood, or thereabouts, he had been modeling these figures in clay, a\r\nspontaneous and irrepressible outgiving of the spirit in him; figures\r\nstrangely vital, and wittily touched, so that to-day the observer\r\ncoming upon them for the first time beholds them with a sense of\r\nsomething weird, as if in some way he had come also upon the sculptor\r\nbehind his work. Often with no tool but a pocket-knife he worked in\r\nwood to the same results. There are extant faces and busts he carved\r\nthus in wood that have an almost inexplicable potency to suggest\r\ncharacter, thought, or life.\r\n\r\nHe had as great a command over his brush and pencil; his sketch-book\r\nhas a certain charm, distinctive and rare; he had the French artist’s\r\nuncanny power to suggest with a single line an inevitable trait or an\r\novermastering feature of a landscape. He could paint before he had\r\ntaken a lesson. When he was a mere boy, still at Calamba, before he had\r\nentered the Ateneo, a banner was spoiled that was to have been used in\r\none of the local festivals that were then so important; José painted in\r\nits place a banner that all men declared to be better than the\r\noriginal. [43] At the Ateneo he carved an image of the Virgin Mother\r\nthat won the unstinted praise of men not novices in art, and a statue\r\nof Christ that for twenty years was one of the admired exhibits of the\r\nschool hall.\r\n\r\nBy all accounts, this multiplex being could write as easily; he was\r\npoet and dramatist as well as sculptor and painter. At school he\r\ncontinued to practise the art his mother had taught him, showing\r\nhimself a skilled practitioner in verse and a devout worshiper of\r\npoetry, Spanish and Tagalog. For, despite the common European belief to\r\nthe contrary, Tagalog is not the dialect of a tribe of savages but a\r\nhighly developed language having an ancient and honorable literature.\r\nThere were poems in Tagalog as early as in English, and many a\r\nbeautiful Tagalog poem has been sung and resung and passed into the\r\nheritage of the people where no European speech had ever been heard.\r\n\r\nAt the age when children usually begin to learn their alphabet this boy\r\nwas making verses. A little later he could see subjects not only for\r\npoems but for plays. Before he was eight years old he had written a\r\ndrama that was performed at a local festival and brought him two pesos.\r\nAt the Ateneo, poetry and dramatic composition were his relaxation, his\r\npastime, his joy and rapture, when he turned from the ponderous routine\r\nof the curriculum.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1875, he being then fifteen, he wrote “The Embarkation, a\r\nHymn in Honor of Magellan’s Fleet,” a poem in seven stanzas of eight\r\nlines. The measure may be called anapestic dimeter, of which old\r\nSkelton was a master and in which Herrick occasionally performed, but\r\nrare thereafter in English poetry until Hood and Swinburne revived it.\r\nA few months later he appeared with a poem of nine stanzas arranged\r\nmuch after the manner of the Sicilian octave. This was on “Education”\r\nand contained exquisite imagery, while it showed an unmistakable grasp\r\nof melodic resource. [44]\r\n\r\nIn ranging among all books, old and new, that seemed to promise any\r\nprofit, he came upon one in these days at the Ateneo that helped\r\nmightily to direct his career, while it freshened his young hopes to a\r\nnew bent concerning his people and what was to become of them. It was a\r\nSpanish translation of “Travels in the Philippines,” [45] by Dr. F.\r\nJagor, the German naturalist. Something more than the flora and fauna\r\nof these fascinating Islands concerned Dr. Jagor; like so many other\r\njust and reflective visitors in those parts, he had been led to think\r\nmuch about the remarkable characteristics of the inhabitants and the\r\nsingular misfortune that had befallen them. Unless all signs were\r\ndeceptive, this was a race endowed for a career and a place in the\r\nworld’s procession; of these it had been cheated by an outland\r\ndespotism whose sole foundation stood upon force. In all probability\r\nthis anomaly could not endure. Spain, still groping in the past, was no\r\npossible cicerone for a race that felt springing within it the strong\r\nman-child of nationality and progress. One thing, if none other, was at\r\nhand to insure the doom of such absurdity. Dr. Jagor had traveled in\r\nthe United States and considered its profound influence upon other\r\nnations. Its life and growth were daily proofs before him of the\r\neternal persistence of the democratic idea, and from that showing the\r\nworld could never turn away. He saw that the example of the United\r\nStates had spurred all South America to revolt and eventually to win\r\nfreedom; hence he concluded that the spread of this influence around\r\nthe Pacific was inevitable. [46]\r\n\r\n\r\n    In proportion as the navigation of the west coast of America\r\n    extends the influence of the American element over the South Sea\r\n    [wrote this prophet], the captivating, magic power that the great\r\n    republic exercises over the Spanish colonies will not fail to make\r\n    itself also felt in the Philippines. The Americans are evidently\r\n    destined to bring to a full development the germs originated by the\r\n    Spaniards. Conquerors of modern times, they pursue their road to\r\n    victory with the assistance of the pioneer’s ax and plow,\r\n    representing an age of peace and commercial prosperity in contrast\r\n    to that bygone and chivalrous age whose champions were upheld by\r\n    the cross and protected by the sword....\r\n\r\n    With regard to permanence, the Spanish system cannot for a moment\r\n    be compared with that of America. While each of the Spanish\r\n    colonies, in order to favor a privileged class by immediate gains,\r\n    exhausted still more the already enfeebled populace of the\r\n    metropolis by the withdrawal of the best of its ability, America,\r\n    on the contrary, has attracted to itself from all countries the\r\n    most energetic element, which, once on its soil and freed from all\r\n    fetters, restlessly progressing, has extended its power and\r\n    influence still farther and farther. The Philippines will escape\r\n    the action of the two great neighboring powers [the United States\r\n    and Great Britain] all the less for the fact that neither they [the\r\n    Philippines] nor their metropolis find their condition of a stable\r\n    and well-balanced nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese deliberated forecasts deeply impressed Rizal. They were written\r\nabout 1874. Looking back now, the applause Jagor deserves for his keen\r\nvision is easy, but in 1874 or 1876 who hailed him as a prophet? If he\r\nfound a disciple outside of the grim walls of the Ateneo the fact\r\nescaped record; but to Rizal the sequence seemed normal to his own\r\nreflections. He had an instinctive faith in the latent capacity of his\r\npeople; now he noted that this cool-minded scientist came from judicial\r\nanalysis of these same people to share the same belief. The next step\r\nwas facile; he perceived the logical procession of Jagor’s reasonings\r\nabout the rising American influence. It must be so, then, that America\r\nwould prove to be light and leadership to the Far East, and from this\r\ntime he turned to the United States as an example and a well-spring of\r\nhope. [47]\r\n\r\nThat same year came the celebration of the first one hundred years of\r\nAmerican independence, and the reports of it fell pat with his new\r\nmeditations. As a rule, the newspapers of Manila, inspired by the\r\nSpanish habitude, had referred with phrases of contempt to the American\r\nrepublic. The centennial festival seemed to modify or to beat through\r\ntheir prejudices, for space was given to long and respectful reviews of\r\nthe progress and achievements of the United States, and with these an\r\noutline of the desperate struggle by which it had won its independence.\r\nUpon a mind like Rizal’s, enlisted for freedom, susceptible to all\r\nthings heroic and idealistic, the effect must have been galvanic. It\r\nwas a lesson of more than one angle. Here was a people that had been\r\nunder such an incubus of political medievalism as was strangling his\r\ncountrymen. A handful challenging the greatest power in the world, they\r\nhad achieved their emancipation, and he could not fail to note that the\r\ndisparity between the Philippines and Spain was hardly greater than\r\nthat between America and Great Britain in 1776.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the heart of the system the Americans had thrown\r\nover was the idea that the royal authority imposed upon them was of God\r\nand resistance to it was an impiety God would surely punish. One\r\nnation, according to this record, had not only resisted such authority\r\nbut cast it off and trampled upon it, and, behold, its reward was not\r\nthe curse but the apparent blessing of God in richest measure. He\r\nstudied the history of this nation, considered its work in the world,\r\nand deemed the conclusions of Jagor to be sound and just.\r\n\r\nBut Jagor had supplied also a certain warning. “It seems to be\r\ndesirable for the natives [Filipinos] that the above-mentioned views\r\nshould not speedily become accomplished facts, because their education\r\nand training hitherto have not been of a nature to prepare them\r\nsuccessfully to compete with either of the other two energetic,\r\ncreative, and progressive nations.” Nothing could be plainer; this was\r\nthe great work to which he should apply himself. His people must be\r\ntrained and educated for the freedom they were one day to have. They\r\nmust be educated first and then aroused. Therefore, whatever learning,\r\ndiscipline, equipment of facts and knowledge, power and resources he\r\ncould gain were capital, energy, equipment laid by for their service.\r\n\r\nToward two sorts of men the world has never warmed while they lived;\r\ntoward a man of melancholy and a man with a fixed and serious purpose\r\nother than material. Rizal was both of these in one. A school is a\r\nmicrocosm of the world outside it. He was admired at the Ateneo but\r\nwent his way there essentially alone. He seems to have felt that this\r\nmust be so and accepted loneliness in the spirit of his philosophy and\r\nas part of the task laid upon him. The natural complement of his\r\nloneliness was an unusual capacity for friendship; the natural\r\ncomplement of his melancholy was a keen sense of humor and a flashing\r\nwit; for so do men seem to be made up and (except in novels and plays)\r\nnever of one piece.\r\n\r\nBeing real and breathing and not a lay figure of romance, Rizal was\r\nlike the rest of us, subject to gusts of this and that and a gamut of\r\nmoods; and yet, like other men of strong will, managed to steer fairly\r\nstraight for one landfall. When the fit was on him he was wont to draw\r\nfor his family vastly funny sketches, to write quips, to make jokes,\r\nand even to fashion comic verses. His gift of portraiture, a singular\r\npower to reproduce with convincing strokes any face he had ever noted,\r\nran over at the least provocation into rollicking burlesque. In later\r\ntimes he would have been a priceless cartoonist; to illuminate any\r\nthought that crossed his mind a humorous or grotesque or inspiring\r\npicture fell easily from his pencil. It was from his brooding\r\nintrospection that he reacted to his excruciatingly funny caricatures,\r\nand if he had not some such vent might have gone mad or (terrible\r\nthought!) even have become a prig.\r\n\r\nBut from these adventures he came back to the sobering facts of his\r\nmission as the business and only reality of life. To contribute\r\nsomething to the helping and enlightening of these people was his\r\nmétier and the only thing really important. A many-sided man, as you\r\nshall see. With all the laborious exactions of his time schedule, he\r\ncould still continue his worship of art and beauty; he kept on with his\r\nmodeling, kept on with his painting and poetry. His holidays he\r\nsometimes spent with his mother at Calamba; and his habit was to go\r\nhome to her with a pocketful of verses of his recent making. That\r\nexcellent woman and judicious critic set herself to clarify and direct\r\nthe fire thus burning. [48] She must have succeeded after good models,\r\nfor Rizal freshened the laurels of his Ateneo triumphs by winning\r\nprizes beyond its intellectual tiltyards. The Manila Lyceum of Art and\r\nLiterature founded a competition among Filipino poets, “naturales y\r\nmestizos.” [49] Rizal won it with a poem entitled “To the Philippine\r\nYouth.” [50] From a point of view that was never urged he had no right\r\nto win it: the Lyceum was supposed to be for adults, and he was only\r\neighteen years old. But the subject had called forth the best that was\r\nin him; it offered a chance to preach his favorite theme, to appeal to\r\nhis young countrymen, and to stir in them something of the passion that\r\nmoved him, while he suggested the Filipinas that might be. [51]\r\n\r\nHis achievement went beyond prize-winning. By a route that even he had\r\nnever imagined, it became a thing of history. In this poem he called\r\nthe Philippine Islands his “fatherland.” The Philippine youth were the\r\nBella esperanza de la Patria Mia! [52] Simple and natural as the\r\nreference was, it started the easy typhoon to blowing. No such phrase\r\nfrom such a source with such an application was tolerable. In his poem\r\non “Education,” Rizal had spoken of that sweet wisdom as illuminating\r\nthe “fatherland,” but this was naïvely taken to have a wholly different\r\nmeaning. To these people, in the litany of lip-service, at least, the\r\nonly fatherland they knew was the Spain they had never seen but of\r\nwhich the image in their hearts was all somber and cruel. With\r\npassionate adoration Rizal now spoke of another fatherland, of the\r\nFilipinas of his birthplace; he dared to address it even as a Spaniard\r\nmight address Spain, “Vuela, Genio Grandioso!” “Come, thou great\r\ngenius!” Yet he knew it as a country that breathed the effluvium of an\r\nunnatural existence—chained to a corpse. In irony he was dealing; a\r\nterrible, sobering irony. Already he felt in his heart that the\r\nexisting state could not last; no proud, capable, normally minded\r\npeople with a historic background of their own would long endure it.\r\nEchoes of the great wave that rolled around the rest of the world grew\r\nevery day in the ears of these Islanders. Discontent surged in their\r\nhearts, and Rizal in his poem was the first voice and wise articulation\r\nof their protest. [53]\r\n\r\nIn this, and as a piece of art, it was powerful and significant. He\r\naddressed the young men of the Philippines as if they were like other\r\nyoung men of the world, free, and able to put forth their powers, to\r\nmake their way; not inferior, not the fags and drudges of the hateful\r\nSpanish tradition. Here was innovation—here was danger! In no such vein\r\nwere they accustomed to be addressed, and the neuremic espionage that\r\nsustained the existing order seems to have been quick to notice the\r\nnovelty. He had been careful to declare with due emphasis his loyalty;\r\nbut in every autocracy the uneasy governing class learns first of all\r\nto discount such professions. The poem added to the disfavor in which\r\nthe official world held him; his aloofness and studious habits seem to\r\nhave multiplied suspicion. A youth with such sentiments and such ways\r\nmust be thinking mischief; devilish plottings were irresistibly\r\nsuggested. So, then, the blacker the mark against his name! The press\r\nof Manila, all censored, all edited in behalf of the rulers, seems to\r\nhave learned early of this proscription. In the stealthy way of the\r\njournalistic prostitute it was already giving Rizal warning. [54]\r\n\r\nThere were other things in his habits not calculated to give\r\npleasurable sensations to sedulous supporters of things as they were.\r\nFrom the beginning of his career at the Ateneo he had taken the\r\nposition that the Filipino boys were not to serve as door-mats and\r\npunching-bags for their Spanish fellow-students. He had the courage to\r\ninsist upon this principle at whatever cost, which was often the\r\nbreaking of his own head. In all years and all conditions it is\r\ncharacter that determines; naturally he became the leader of the\r\nFilipinos in all these encounters and led them without flinching. The\r\nrecluse came from his cell at the sound of battle; the student threw\r\naside schedule and book. He had grown at the Ateneo; he was no longer a\r\nmidget; and, having kept up his exercises with the rest of his regimen,\r\nhe could hit hard and take punishment. One side or the other was driven\r\noff the field; he contrived to make the retreat a rout if victory sat\r\nupon his banners. “Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown more\r\nthan your enemies.” One of these conflicts had, as you are presently to\r\nlearn, results that he had never counted upon; among them another\r\nshadow on a life already troubled enough.\r\n\r\nOn March 23, 1876, he received the degree of bachelor of arts with the\r\nhighest honors from the Ateneo, and in April, 1877, [55] matriculated\r\nat the ancient university of Santo Tomas. [56] Some of his studies he\r\ncontinued to pursue at the Ateneo, which he always preferred. The\r\nchoice of a career still weighed upon him; in what way of life,\r\nbusiness or profession, could he fit best and furnish the most help? He\r\nlooked upon the fertile soil of the Islands, he looked upon the\r\nmedieval methods of cultivation in use there, and he half resolved to\r\nbe a scientific farmer and show the wonders of which the soil was\r\ncapable. He looked upon the general ignorance of the laws of health\r\namong his people and in the end determined to be a physician, choosing\r\ndiseases of the eye to be his specialty. Oculists were almost unknown\r\nin the islands, even poor ones; and diseases of the eye were\r\nwide-spread there as in all tropical countries. Every year many\r\nFilipinos went blind whose sight science might easily have saved. For\r\nlack of competent treatment his own mother was likely to share this\r\ndread calamity.\r\n\r\nTo the profession he had chosen he surrendered nothing of his addiction\r\nto the arts; he modeled, painted, drew, and sang as before. Without\r\nyielding to the extravagant eulogy that has attended his fame in recent\r\nyears, it appears certain that he was in art one of those rare\r\ncreatures that are endowed at once with two great faculties. He could\r\ncreate and he could analyze; he could feel and he could reason; and on\r\neither side his activities could be carried on with the same native\r\nease.\r\n\r\nAbout the time he was entering Santo Tomas the Lyceum staged another\r\npoetic tourney, this time to celebrate the glory of Cervantes. Rizal\r\nwas a competitor with an allegory called “The Council of the Gods,” in\r\nwhich he developed a critical exposition of Cervantes and his art,\r\nlucid, just, and competent; as remarkable a production as the\r\nimaginative part of his work. The awarding of the prizes in this\r\ncompetition resulted in a painful incident that took its place in the\r\nchain of fateful things now drawing him away. Mystery surrounds the\r\nfacts and always will, but it appears that the competitors entered the\r\nlists with assumed names, and that Rizal won the first prize; but when\r\nhe was discovered to be a Filipino the laurel was taken from him and\r\nbestowed upon a Spaniard. [57] It was a slash in the old wound; not\r\neven in that domain of art, supposed to have shut doors upon the\r\nprejudices of nation and birth, was the Filipino to be allowed to\r\nforget his inferiority. His fellows at the Ateneo felt that he had been\r\nwronged, and knowledge of the general resentment took nothing from the\r\nill will with which he was viewed by the governing class. In all lands\r\nit is the fate of the foreign colony to be swayed by puerile emotions;\r\namong these in the Spanish colony of Manila suspicion led all the rest.\r\n\r\nMeantime his fate was crying out to him in strange voices that led him,\r\nbefore he was aware, into the road from the Philippines. At the Ateneo\r\nthe students were fond of enacting plays of their own devising. Rizal\r\nwas poet and dramatist; here was the plain call to his favorite\r\npursuit. He wrote for his fellows a metrical drama called “Beside the\r\nPasig,” and on December 8, 1880, it was publicly performed by one of\r\nthe student societies. Courage he had never lacked, the courage of a\r\nmind too reasonable to be deluded by fear. He showed now what he had in\r\nhis heart. One of the characters in his drama was the devil himself.\r\nInto the mouth of Sathanas he put (with a dazzling audacity) a sentence\r\ndenouncing Spain and her policy toward the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThere are single colorations of character that sometimes reveal and\r\nilluminate the whole man. This was one of them. Disclosed here was a\r\ncertain precise, firm touch of workmanship as typical as was the pluck\r\ndemanded to say such a thing. The perfect barbing of the satirical\r\narrow no Philippine audience could miss; Spain so bad that the devil\r\nhimself condemned her! Nothing could be more poisonous. But among the\r\npersons whose attention was enchained by the daring flight of fancy\r\nwere members of the Government’s secret service. To keep watch against\r\nsuch young enthusiasts tempted to raillery upon the existing order was\r\na chief point in their varied and malign industry, and in this instance\r\nthe author of these burning thoughts was no stranger to them. Even if\r\nthe bold iconoclast had never shocked right-minded people by calling\r\nthe Philippines his fatherland, he must have been from the first an\r\nobject of suspicion to the souls that could find sedition in the\r\ndrooping of an eyebrow. Brother of Paciano Rizal, son of Francisco\r\nRizal Mercado, should aught but evil come of that stock? To these\r\nferrets, his outbreaks in verse must have been no more than the\r\nfulfilment of prophecy.\r\n\r\nThen, again, Rizal did not like Santo Tomas. He was galled to think\r\nthat its methods of instruction lagged behind those of the Ateneo,\r\nwhich it should have led. He knew well enough that the cold frown of\r\nhostility was turned upon him by the friar professors. Santo Tomas was\r\nDominican; the Ateneo was Jesuit. In Rizal’s case jealousy between the\r\ntwo orders was added to the heavy handicap he must pay as a reputed\r\ninsurgent against the System. The Jesuits had sent forth this\r\nprize-winning prodigy. Logically, then, the other orders were\r\nconstrained to sniff at him.\r\n\r\nHe had other encounters with the System that in so many and diverse\r\nways wearied his people. One night when he was visiting his mother at\r\nCalamba he came, half blinded, out of the lighted house into the\r\ndarkness of the street and dimly perceived passing him the figure of a\r\nman. Not knowing who or what it was, Rizal said nothing and made no\r\nmovement. With a snarl, the figure turned upon him, whipped out a\r\nsword, and slashed him across the back. It was a Civil Guard—so called.\r\nRizal’s duty as a Filipino under the barbarous code of the times was to\r\nmake a salute whenever he might see one of these strutting persons.\r\nSpaniards need not salute; only Filipinos. If he had known that this\r\nwas one of the precious police Rizal would have performed the important\r\nceremony and so fulfilled his obligation to king and country. As in the\r\ndark the policeman looked like anybody else he thought it hard to be\r\nwounded for not possessing the vision of a cat. The injury was painful\r\nbut not serious. When he recovered, he deemed it his duty to report to\r\nthe authorities what had occurred. Jeering indifference was all his\r\nreward. An Indio had no rights that a Civil Guard was bound to respect,\r\nand instead of complaining Rizal should be offering thanks that the\r\noffended soldier had not taken his life.\r\n\r\nAll these experiences must have weighed together, but it was the\r\npolitical aspect of his plight, no doubt, that decided him. He had set\r\nout in life resolved to win the best education his times and his means\r\nmight allow; for himself and more, for his cause much greater than\r\nhimself. He now began to see that in his country, and even because of\r\nhis love for it, he would be debarred from the knowledge and training\r\nhe desired for its sake. Often the sage old counselors had told him to\r\nlook abroad for that training, not at home. Most Filipinos that had won\r\nany eminence had first escaped from the evil environment of their\r\nnativity. So long as he could he resisted these arguments. The lost\r\nprize seems to have completed the business for him. He made up his mind\r\nto get the rest of his education abroad.\r\n\r\nTo go was not so easy as to dream of going. He must have a passport,\r\nand of all men in Manila he was the last to which the Government would\r\nallow that or any other favor; the patriot poet, the singer of the\r\n“fatherland,” the critic of Spain, suspected of sowing treason in the\r\nminds of youths at best none too docile. Through the help of a cousin\r\nand his own ingenuity, he evaded this difficulty and all others. The\r\ncousin got a passport in another name. Paciano and an uncle supplied\r\nfunds; [58] a sister gave him a diamond ring to pawn. To outwit\r\nofficial suspicion, José went to Calamba ostensibly to visit his\r\nfamily, and really to wait until a vessel should be ready to sail. A\r\ncryptic telegram gave him the warning. He slipped into Manila and after\r\nmidnight stole aboard his steamer. When day broke he was well on his\r\nway to Singapore. [59]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nVOICES OF PROPHECY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat life meant for average millions in the Philippines, under what\r\nchill shadows of the jail and visions of the firing-squad they must\r\ndraw breath, how shifty and blackguard was the Government imposed upon\r\nthem, we may glimpse from what happened as soon as Rizal’s absence was\r\ndiscovered. Civil Guards and official eavesdroppers were busy at\r\nCalamba; all members of the family were dogged, watched, waylaid, and\r\ncross-questioned as if suspected of murder. They must do more than lie\r\nto protect themselves. Paciano, the brother, who had been a confidant\r\nin this desperate plot to take ship and go, was reduced to a kind of\r\nplay-acting, running about Rizal’s lodging and inquiring frantically\r\nfor his lost brother as if he conjectured suicide, assassination, or\r\nkidnapping. All the Government seems to have been thrown into chill\r\nalarm by the fact that one college student, not yet of age, had left\r\nManila without its permission. If there has been upon this earth a\r\ntyranny that existed without the finger of fear upon it history,\r\nsurely, has no mention of it, and in the case of the Spanish tyranny in\r\nthe Philippines the vague and kindergarten terrors that assailed it had\r\nlong been notorious. To be afraid of a solitary student whose most\r\ndangerous manifestation had been a taste for radical poetry may seem\r\nfantastical to steadier pulses but was real enough to the anxious souls\r\nthat then steered Spain’s sovereignty through unquiet waters. In due\r\ntime the fact could no longer be concealed; gone he had indeed and in\r\nvery truth—gone, quite gone. Then, in characteristic fashion, the\r\nGovernment proceeded to revenge itself upon the fugitive’s relatives.\r\nIt was again a case of a second cousin where the offender or his\r\nbrother was not available. In vengeance the taste of the Government was\r\nnever overnice. To make somebody suffer was its length and breadth, and\r\nnot too much haggling as to the identity of the victim.\r\n\r\nSketch-book in hand, the cause and occasion of all this uproar pursued\r\nhis way in peace, recording types among his fellow-passengers and\r\nsopping up information like some form of sponge. From Singapore he\r\njourneyed by French mail-boat through the Suez Canal to Marseilles, and\r\nso to Barcelona. There he tarried some months and observed without\r\ninfection the extreme revolutionary movement that centered always in\r\nthat restless city. [60] Many Filipinos were in Barcelona; it was\r\npassing strange to one late escaped from the gag-law and press-gang\r\nconditions of the Philippines to a place under the same flag where men\r\ncould say and print what they thought. There were publications in\r\nBarcelona that in the Philippines would have brought out the\r\nexecutioner and added martyrs to the overcharged lists of Bagumbayan\r\nField. The Socratic mind of Rizal, with a question for every\r\nphenomenon, could not fail to note this nor to find the cause of it.\r\nGovernment loved freedom of speech no better in Barcelona than in\r\nManila. But in Barcelona the people were ready to fight for their\r\nrights as they had fought for them more than once. In this fact lay all\r\nthe contrast.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Madrid, where he came soon after to anchor, he\r\nelected to study medicine, literature, and philosophy, while outside\r\nthe university he took on art and modern languages. The burden of so\r\nmany studies was less than its appalling appearance, or less for Rizal.\r\nWith him, as with other good minds reared in a bilingual atmosphere,\r\nlanguages were an easy acquisition. In his childhood he had spoken\r\nTagalog and Spanish; at school he had added Latin and Greek; after the\r\nschool of the pedant, to be sure, but still Latin and Greek. He now\r\nassailed French, English, and Italian, all at the same time, and\r\nwithout apparent difficulty. A little later, he mastered Catalan,\r\nArabic, German, Sanskrit, and Hebrew.\r\n\r\nAt Madrid it was with him as it had been at the Ateneo. In a few weeks\r\nthe university buzzed about this rare young Filipino that could do so\r\nmany things brilliantly and lived so much like a Trappist monk. His\r\nfellows remarked of him that he had at its best the fine, gracious\r\ncourtesy characteristic of his people but was no great addition to the\r\nuniversity’s social assets. If the cafés, clubs, and other places the\r\nstudents thronged knew little of him, he had two good reasons for\r\nkeeping to himself and living modestly. His excursion in higher\r\neducation was financed on slender terms by his father and his brother,\r\nand he had work in hand that took all his attention; he must be at all\r\ntimes about his country’s business. To a certain extent when he walked\r\napart he was doing violence to his own nature. By temperament he was no\r\nhorseman for black care to ride behind. He was frank, cordial, quick,\r\nrather sanguine, and appreciative of good company and of conversation\r\nwith good minds. When he had the luck to fall in with these and\r\nloosened the rein upon himself, or when he was with his own circle and\r\nforgot the great thing he lived for, he made the common air sparkle\r\nwith shrewd, witty comment. [61] His studies in so many languages had\r\ngiven him an unusual vocabulary; his talk flowed on without a break.\r\n\r\nHis own circle was a group of about a score of Filipino students, and\r\n(strange to say) one Englishman and one German, that somehow found\r\nthemselves to be congenial and elected to meet at one remote café.\r\nThere they read the newspapers (London), played dominoes and chess, and\r\ntalked about serious things. It was the opinion of these young men that\r\nRizal came too seldom to their meetings, but whenever he consented to\r\nbe of the company he was its intellectual electric battery. He liked to\r\nplay chess and played it well; he liked better to discuss and to learn.\r\nOne afternoon he came in and announced that he was going away. He sat\r\nby the side of the table and drew with his pencil on its bare top a\r\nmerry caricature of every person present. Then he bade them good-bye\r\nand disappeared, and a waiter came with a cloth dipped in kerosene and\r\nerased the drawings. The place did not see him again. [62] A few years\r\nlater, the price of those caricatures the waiter so easily expunged\r\nwould have equaled the value of the café.\r\n\r\nHe carried to Madrid his favorite notion of life led by time-tables;\r\nand, dividing his day into segments, set apart one for general reading.\r\nIn this his choice was liberal; anything that would be likely to assist\r\nhis purpose was welcome. French classics, Shakespeare, Goethe, to help\r\nhis lingual studies; books on modern political questions; history above\r\neverything, any history; biography by way of illustration; and the\r\ntheater (which he attended as often as his purse would allow) for\r\nreadjustment.\r\n\r\nA book that early captivated him was a volume of the lives of the\r\nPresidents of the United States, printed in Spain and in Spanish. [63]\r\nIt seems to have made a deep impression upon him; he all but wore it\r\nout with frequent thumbings, and procured another edition with later\r\nbiographies that he carried with him wherever he went. These stories of\r\nso many picturesque careers to eminence must have had an apt relation\r\nto Jagor’s prophecy, a thing he never forgot. The application was too\r\nobvious to escape such a mind. In a democracy, men born into the utmost\r\npoverty, men born in log huts, the sons of peasants, the sons of\r\nartisans, made their way to the highest positions, and not a soul cast\r\ntheir birth at them. It was so; here were the recorded proofs. Under\r\nthe old monarchical system of society they would have found every door\r\nshut in their faces and a thousand chains of caste to hold them in the\r\npit where they had been born. In a democracy every door stood open and\r\nnothing impeded their ascent. Why does anybody write fiction when fact\r\nis so much more dramatic and wonderful? In a student’s cell in a back\r\ncorner of Madrid was then being forged the wedge of brass that was to\r\noverthrow moldering antiquity in all the Pacific and all the Far East,\r\nand was so far hidden from the wise and prudent of earth they would\r\nhave laughed at the mere suggestion of it. Yet there it was, day and\r\nnight—forging. Well could Prophet Jagor see what was to happen but not\r\nthe manner of it. He knew that in the end it was the United States that\r\nwould remake the Philippines, even if at the time he wrote the American\r\npeople in general were so little acquainted with this part of the sun’s\r\ndominions that to many of them Filipino suggested only something to\r\neat; even if he never dreamed that the instrument Fate would use in\r\nstrange ways to bring all this to pass was in the hand of a slim brown\r\nyouth naturally addicted to poetry and mooning.\r\n\r\nWhile he was yet in the university, Rizal came into contact with\r\nanother influence that affected both his career and the story of his\r\ncountry. He became a freemason. Upon all secret societies, but\r\nespecially upon the freemasons, the governing class in the Philippines\r\nhad scowled implacably; the friars and the church generally being still\r\nmore hostile. The governing class in its jumpy way believed that any\r\nkind of secret organization must signify treason; the Civil Guards\r\nobjected because here were keyholes at which one could not watch; the\r\nfriars thought freemasonry threatened the economic welfare of the\r\nchurch. By these, Rizal’s religious convictions were gravely doubted,\r\nbut need not have been since they were easily ascertained. He was of a\r\nbroad and sweet faith and a charitable practice, cherishing a universal\r\ntolerance refreshing to encounter, but he was in the substance of his\r\nbelief a loyal Catholic. In his father’s house he had been accustomed\r\nto hear religious questions discussed without the least restraint; [64]\r\nwithin those walls Francisco Mercado would have freedom of speech if it\r\nexisted nowhere else in Filipinas. From such discussions he had learned\r\nthat religion was a matter about which men would differ widely and yet\r\nwithout just reproach; the independent, courageous, and conscientious\r\nman would decide for himself. When he came to understand the\r\nsubjugation of his country and the part played in that great wrong by\r\nthe monastic orders his faith in the organized church as the custodian\r\nof men’s minds and thinkings faded out, but not his faith in the\r\nessentials of the Christian religion, from which he seems never to have\r\nwandered.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion that freemasonry was or could be a foe to religion he\r\nscoffed. Not only did he accept masonry for himself but he resolved\r\nthat upon his return to the Philippines he would further it among his\r\ncountrymen. He may have loved it for the enemies it had made; he would\r\nhave been scarcely human if he had not felt some such impulse. But\r\nbeyond all such considerations he must have found in the ritual\r\nsomething of beauty and in the associations something of the calm and\r\nfortitude for which the sorely tried soul yearned within him. We are to\r\nremember here again that he was one carried by fate and the stress of\r\nconditions out of his inclinings. He had the soul of an artist; by\r\nsheer force of will he put himself down into an arena of strife. He\r\nloved the cloister, books, and meditation; he forced himself to battle\r\nwith primitive men for primitive rights. He was a poet, with an ear\r\npeculiarly sensitive to sweet sounds, a soul on fire about beauty and\r\nits recompenses; and he turned his back upon all these because he\r\nthought he heard a call to duty. Some men give their lives to a great\r\ncause; some men give still more.\r\n\r\nTo reinforce the pittance his uncle was able to send him he earned\r\nmoney by tutoring, though to work one’s way through a university was\r\nnot so easy nor so common at Madrid as we know it in America. He seems\r\nto have been a fairly human kind of instructor. According to a letter\r\nfrom one of his class in German he showed an exceedingly human\r\nimpatience when his pupils failed to grasp his ideas as rapidly as he\r\nuttered them. [65]\r\n\r\nThroughout all his studies he performed better in languages, history,\r\nand belles lettres than in medicine; conclusive proof that he had not\r\nfollowed his own desires but made a sacrifice of them when he chose\r\nthis profession. We have here his school ratings from 1878 in Manila\r\nuntil the time he left Madrid University; they offer material for an\r\ninteresting mental clinic if one cares to undertake the exercise:\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOLASTIC RECORDS OF JOSÉ RIZAL\r\n\r\nStudies in Medicine\r\n\r\n    In Manila: First Year (1878–79)\r\n\r\n      Physics—Fair\r\n      Chemistry—Excellent\r\n      Natural history—Fair\r\n      Anatomy No. 1—Good\r\n      Dissection No. 1—Good\r\n\r\n    Second Year (1879–80)\r\n\r\n      Anatomy No. 2—Good\r\n      Dissection No. 2—Good\r\n      Physiology—Good\r\n      Private hygiene—Good\r\n      Public hygiene—Good\r\n\r\n    Third Year (1880–81)\r\n\r\n      Pathology, general—Fair\r\n      Therapeutics—Excellent\r\n      Operation (surgery)—Good\r\n\r\n    Fourth Year (1881–82)\r\n\r\n      Pathology, medical—Very good\r\n      Pathology, surgical—Very good\r\n      Obstetrics—Very good\r\n\r\n    In Madrid, Spain: Fifth Year (1882–83)\r\n\r\n      Medical clinics No. 1—Good\r\n      Surgical clinics No. 1—Good\r\n      Obstetrical clinics—Fair\r\n      Legal medicine or medical law—Excellent\r\n\r\n    Sixth Year (1883–84)\r\n\r\n      Medical clinics No. 2—Good\r\n      Surgical clinics No. 2—Very good\r\n      He became licentiate in medicine on June 21, 1884, with the \r\n      rating “fair” (aprobado) (degree granted June 1, 1887).\r\n      He obtained the doctor’s degree (1884–85):\r\n\r\n        History of the medical science—Fair\r\n        Chemical analysis—Good\r\n        Histology, normal—Excellent\r\n\r\n\r\nStudies in Philosophy and Letters\r\n\r\n\r\n    In Manila, March 14, 1877, he obtained the bachelor’s degree with \r\n    the rating “excellent”\r\n\r\n    In Madrid, 1882–83:\r\n\r\n      Universal history—Very good\r\n      General literature—Excellent\r\n\r\n    1883–84\r\n\r\n      Universal history No. 2—Excellent\r\n      Greek and Latin literature—Excellent with a prize\r\n      Greek No. 1—Excellent with a prize\r\n\r\n    1884–85\r\n\r\n      Spanish literature—Excellent with free scholarship\r\n      Arabic language—Excellent with free scholarship\r\n      Greek No. 2—Excellent\r\n      History of Spain—Good\r\n      Hebrew—Excellent\r\n      Cosmology, metaphysics, theodicy, and history of philosophy were\r\n      studied by him in Manila and finished in July, 1877, and March, \r\n      1878, with rating “excellent”\r\n      Licentiate in philosophy and letters, June 19, 1885, “excellent.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThree years elapsed between the bestowing of his licentiate in medicine\r\nand the taking of his degree. The lapse was never explained by Rizal,\r\nbut the reason was his poverty. His father was now in much distress,\r\nand Rizal to prosecute his studies must live with narrow scrimping and\r\nsometimes on crusts. He could not afford to pay the fee for his\r\ndoctor’s degree and went without it until his fortunes mended.\r\n\r\nBut his record of triumphs in philosophy and letters must have balanced\r\nall possible regrets for the lack of this laurel while it added to his\r\ngreat fame in the student world. So many scholarships, honors,\r\nmentions, “excellents”!—these were the prizes he had won with so much\r\nindustry. The plan of his career he had now worked out to his\r\nsatisfaction: he was to visit the foremost countries of Europe, study\r\ntheir institutions, learn the secrets of their progress, and carry home\r\nto his countrymen information that might spur them to cast off their\r\nlethargy and emerge from the national eclipse. Meantime, he was to\r\nperfect himself in his profession that he might add to his usefulness\r\nand take up his work among them. From Madrid, therefore, he went to\r\nParis, where he became clinical assistant to Dr. L. de Weckert, one of\r\nthe most famous oculists of Europe. [66]\r\n\r\nIt was in Paris that he took the first direct steps to his own ruin.\r\nWhile still in Madrid he had come upon the idea of addressing his\r\ncountrymen through the medium of a novel. He had been reading and\r\nstudying Mrs. Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” and he pondered with awe the\r\nfar-reaching effect upon history and human progress of that inspired\r\nwork. The thought occurred to him that similarly wrought pictures of\r\nthe servitude of the Filipinos might awaken them to a knowledge of the\r\nyoke that was slowly crushing them, pictures that might at the same\r\ntime reveal to the world the justice of the Filipino cause. He went so\r\nfar as to suggest such a work to the Filipino club at Madrid, the story\r\nto be of joint authorship; for he seems to have had doubts of his own\r\nability. When his fellow-members failed to see how great were the\r\nopportunities involved he was driven back upon himself, as he so often\r\nhad been and was to be. From Madrid to Paris the idea grew upon him. At\r\nParis he took his pen and started seriously upon the composition of a\r\nstory of Philippine life.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of “Noli Me Tangere,” the greatest work in\r\nPhilippine literature and one of the great achievements of all times\r\nand all lands. He was not perfectly equipped to be a novelist, for he\r\nhad not the great dramatic fictional sense that sees a moving tale in\r\nthe large and coördinates to the catastrophe every incident as the plot\r\nunfolds; but he had assets many dramatic fictionists never possess. He\r\nhad the compelling fire of a lofty indignation, the sense of a great\r\ncause, the faultless knowledge of the hearts and minds and sorrows of\r\nthe people of his little stage. He had something else that put him in a\r\nclass with Dickens, Robert Louis Stevenson, and William Dean Howells.\r\nHe was a great reporter. Nature had gifted him with a marvelous power\r\nof observation; as truly as with his pencil he made those startling and\r\nhardly surpassed sketches of men and things, so accurately his mind\r\nseized and stored the significance of incidents, conversations, petty\r\nbroils, clashing ambitions, village tyrants, unsung Hampdens, and\r\ncities of men and manners.\r\n\r\nHe wrote in Paris the opening chapters of “Noli Me Tangere” and carried\r\nthem to Heidelberg, where the next year he was a student at the\r\nuniversity. [67]\r\n\r\nBy this time he had begun to attract the attention of scientists for\r\nzealot-like devotion to his scientific research. At Madrid, Paris,\r\nHeidelberg, he was first the student and then the close friend and\r\ncoadjutor of the foremost oculists of that time. It appears that upon\r\nhis capacity and powers of concentration, which were extraordinary,\r\nthey founded large hopes of a brilliant professional career. Despite\r\nhis preoccupation and his aloofness, it is equally apparent that he\r\nexercised upon them the charm of a singularly magnetic manner. Readily\r\nhe made friends; as easily he kept them. To the end of his life some of\r\nthe greatest scientists in Europe, men like Virchow, Jagor,\r\nBlumentritt, and de Weckert held him in affectionate esteem and\r\ndelighted to correspond with him.\r\n\r\nThey had sound human reasons for liking him. In addition to so liberal\r\na store of other good gifts, this man was a master of the now rare art\r\nof letter-writing. To the family at home he sent the most charming\r\nepistles, full of shrewd observations, colorful descriptions, and a\r\ncheerful wit. Often they were illustrated with his incomparable\r\nthumb-nail drawings and humorous designs, and sometimes when he wrote\r\nto his mother he sent her the latest poems on which he had been\r\nengrossed. [68]\r\n\r\nFrom Heidelberg he went to Leipzig and its university, studying, in\r\nespecial, psychology; thence to Berlin, where he took cheap lodgings\r\nand settled himself to complete his novel while he should still pursue\r\nhis studies; for besides his specialties he had lately taken on\r\nanthropology and entomology.\r\n\r\nHis association with Virchow enlarged and enlightened his views\r\nconcerning democracy and overcame much of the grave disadvantages of\r\nhis birth. Men born under a monarchy have always this to overcome if\r\nthey are to become effective soldiers of the Common Good. Virchow was a\r\nphilosophical democrat that had seen, as in a long perspective, the\r\nascent of man and had drawn thence an unshakable faith. Although Rizal\r\nwas now more than ever a democrat, on calmly reviewing the state of his\r\ncountrymen he believed that for his day the national independence of\r\nthe Philippines was out of the question. Memories of the popular\r\nignorance oppressed him. To be free, he thought, a people must know how\r\nto use freedom. It seems not to have occurred to him that there was no\r\nschool but one in which that precious wisdom could be taught, and in it\r\nwere and could be no text-books. For, whatever scholiasts may imagine\r\nand Utopians dream, it is experience and experience alone that tutors\r\nman in the good use of his freedom. The theory that a nation must wait\r\nuntil all its men have university degrees before it can be trusted with\r\nits destinies is either the dishonest handmaid of exploitation or, as\r\nin Rizal’s case, the footless product of the cloisters. Man, endowed\r\nwith freedom, will use it wrongly and use it rightly; and which is the\r\nright way and which the wrong he will not know until responsibility\r\nenlightens him. After all, it is not wholly strange that even so\r\nexcellent a mind as Rizal’s should have gone astray on this point; for\r\nhe was codisciple of the schoolmen, and in his day schoolmen taught\r\nonly his error. We need not on this account lower any estimate of his\r\nworth and genius. He could see that if in his day and with their\r\nantecedents the people of the Philippines should suddenly arrive at\r\ntheir independence they would probably make for a time but erratic use\r\nof it. What he could not see was that at its worst their condition then\r\nwould be better than the blight and curse of their previous state, and\r\nthat under the tuition of experience they would work out their problems\r\nand vindicate their capacity.\r\n\r\nBut we have to deal here with the unfolding of this marvelous man and\r\nthe heritage of his deeds and thought. He meditated long upon the\r\nunfortunate state of his people; he saw them bogged in ignorance and\r\nblinded by superstition, and hence he concluded that until there should\r\nbe popular education, independence would mean only failure and\r\ntemporary reversion. Of the eventual freedom of the Philippines, as of\r\ntheir eventual greatness and glory among men, he had never a doubt.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the first work in hand was to arouse these people to the need\r\nof education and to wrest from Spain by peaceful means some practical\r\nrelief from the savage tyranny that weighed down their hearts, darkened\r\ntheir lives, and of purpose kept them in ignorance.\r\n\r\nWith all his other occupations he found time to press the work on his\r\ngreat book, until he had completed in it an exposition of the full body\r\nof his faith. Perhaps in the way of construction it is not so much a\r\nnovel as a series of vivid pictures of life in the Philippines of that\r\ntime; but with a strangely vivifying necromancy difficult to analyze or\r\ndefine, the power of these pictures is hardly excelled in modern\r\nliterature. [69] We may believe that the secret of this compelling\r\npower is the intensity of Rizal’s feeling; it gives to his portraitures\r\na sincerity and virility no striving and no art could come by. He\r\nobeyed, unconsciously, the Sidneyan injunction about the heart and the\r\nwriting; some of the passages seem to be done in his blood and some in\r\nhis tears. The test of their might is easily made. Take to-day a reader\r\nthat has never been in the Philippines and knows nothing of the\r\npeculiar life there; when he has read “Noli Me Tangere” he will not\r\nonly feel that he knows that life but it will be to him as if he had\r\nseen it, as if he had heard these characters talking, noted their\r\nvisages, and discerned their motives no less than their acts. All this\r\nhe will feel in spite of the insulating septum of translation, against\r\nwhich all the finer beauties of the style must fall dead; the terse,\r\nvigorous, often biting sentences through which this tortured heart\r\nuttered its protest, and even the almost magical charm of the\r\ndescriptions of the Philippine environment.\r\n\r\nTo be thus vivid and convincing about any phase of life is not easy; to\r\nmake intimate to the European a life in the world’s remotest outskirts,\r\nof whose terms the European has no conception, in which he has no\r\nnatural interest, whose actors are of a different race, color, and\r\npsychology from his own, is a feat bristling with difficulties. Some\r\ncritics, piqued, maybe, that a Malay at his first attempt should have\r\ntriumphed in a form of art deemed the exclusive heritage of the white\r\nman, have objected that Rizal’s work has no great connected moving\r\nstory, such as Dickens or Ohnet would have dealt in. Suppose this to be\r\ntrue, it is but a narrow view of fictional art. The mirror fiction\r\nholds up to nature may be of many shapes, and the life chosen for\r\nmirroring may be of many phases. All that the world can insist upon is\r\nthat they shall be representative and perfectly shown, and for these\r\nRizal had a facility like that of Cervantes. [70]\r\n\r\nThe theme is the gross, fat-witted tyranny that had enchained the\r\nFilipinos and the extent to which they themselves were to blame for it.\r\nNeither oppressor nor the complaisant among the oppressed was spared in\r\nthose cadent pictures; here each might behold his ugly countenance\r\nfaultlessly drawn. With bitter reproach he showed to his countrymen\r\ntheir ignorance, their sloth, their tame submission that invited more\r\nwrongs. In all human experience one observation has been invariable. It\r\nis that the force that rules with autocratic and irresponsible sway is\r\nable to bear anything else better than ridicule. The ridicule that\r\nRizal poured upon the dominant powers in the Philippines would have\r\nstung to the quick Caracalla himself. One by one he marches them across\r\nthe stage, the whip of his terrible sarcasm always on their shoulders.\r\nIt is an immortal procession: the scheming, arrogant, lawless, immoral\r\nfriar, drunk with power and greed; the Spanish government officer, all\r\nbrute to the native, all crawling sycophant before the powerful orders;\r\nthe arrogant Spanish émigré, stuffed with the ridiculous bombast of a\r\nbygone century, the émigré that has become rich in the islands at the\r\nexpense of the native and now hates and despises the rounds of the\r\nladder by which he did ascend; the native that cringes before the feet\r\nof the classes that have so unspeakably wronged him; the woman of\r\nSpain’s Island colony, “more deadly than the male”; the pretentious and\r\nall but worthless educational system; the raw excesses of the courts;\r\nthe wanton cruelties of a Government conducted by expatriated savages;\r\nthe tortures and pathetic helplessness of the native masses. On all\r\nthis the man worked like Hogarth; he will startle and frighten you, but\r\nhe will convince you on every page that this is the truth. In this\r\nmisery, exactly this, dwelt the unfortunate millions that Spain\r\nmisgoverned; in this terror, thus trampled upon, overawed, silenced,\r\nbut not subdued. These were the people’s oppressors, lustful, cruel,\r\nrapacious, their burning eyes following every pretty woman or girl,\r\ntheir pockets lined with the peasants’ money, their claws reaching for\r\nmore. All the scenes of the drama and all the players in it, drawn with\r\nirresistible art: the Civil Guards, the coarse instruments of this\r\ndespotism; the means by which terror was capitalized; the constant\r\ntemptation to revolt; the devilish work of the agents provocateurs; the\r\nsickening punishments devised for those that yielded to the wiles of\r\nsuch agents. [71] Against this shone the native grace and charm of the\r\nFilipino woman, justly illumined, her goodness, kindness, ready and\r\napprehensive mind, the pitfalls dug for her by the bestial oppressors\r\nof her people. You will say that all the materials are here for one of\r\nthose great dramas of human life that reach down to the primeval base\r\nof first causes and of such framing this book has been made.\r\n\r\nEverywhere is dense ignorance. The world that three hundred years\r\nbefore left all these conditions behind still goes rolling in advance,\r\nand hardly a Filipino knows of its passing. A great population endowed\r\nwith the potentialities of free minds, free limbs, free souls, free\r\nideas, is submitting to a yoke pressed down into men’s very flesh by\r\nsuperstition on one side and brute force on the other.\r\n\r\nWe know that many of the incidents were but transcripts of what Rizal\r\nhimself had seen and known; many of the characters transferred\r\nthemselves from Calamba to his pages. Even when we read them for the\r\nfirst time, and have, maybe, no previous knowledge of the locale, this\r\nconviction of truth and sincerity possesses us; how much more it must\r\nhave reached and stung those whose enormities it paints! “It is only\r\nthe truth that hurts.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n“NOLI ME TANGERE”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story is of a young Filipino, Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra, whose father\r\nhad wealth, was respected by the Spaniards, and wielded much influence\r\namong his own people. Juan, still in his boyhood, is sent to a school\r\nin Europe, that his education may be of the best. All prosperous\r\nFilipinos hoped to send their sons, if they had any, on this quest for\r\nthe classical golden fleece. While Juan is gone his father becomes\r\ninvolved in a dispute with the local friar magnate, the virtual\r\ndictator of all the region about, as always; but this man brutal,\r\narrogant, revengeful, and lawless beyond the average of his peers. The\r\nquarrel is about land; most quarrels with the friars had to do with\r\nland or rents or fees or graft or some fancied lack of crawling\r\nhumility toward overblown pomp. As a rule the ill will of a friar meant\r\nfor the layman involuntary exile taken at utmost speed or a persecution\r\nto the grave and without defense; it being part of the friars’ system\r\nof government that of any person that dared to offend them a salutary\r\nwarning should be made. In the pursuit of this serviceable design, men\r\nput to death for alleged sedition but really because they had fallen\r\nout with the friars were sometimes quartered and hideous fragments of\r\ntheir bodies nailed up in the towns, [72] as in Spain five hundred\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nFather Damaso is the friar that the elder Ibarra has offended. The\r\npower of the System has been put forth. Ibarra, though innocent of any\r\ncrime, is arrested and thrust into prison, where he is kept without\r\nexamination or trial until he wilts away and dies, crying out the name\r\nof his son. All ignorant of these events, Juan comes home; he knows his\r\nfather is dead, but he suspects nothing of foul play. Gradually the\r\ntruth is unfolded to him. He has returned full of hope for the Islands,\r\nfull of faith in their Government. Gradually he is disillusioned, as\r\none ugly development after another shows him the blight under which his\r\npeople drag out their lives.\r\n\r\nStill he knows nothing against Father Damaso. That dark and scowling\r\nfigure he greets as his father’s friend.\r\n\r\nThe views of Island life, sharp, vivid, are like those of a\r\nstereopticon or the wizard Zola. There is a native woman, Sisa, married\r\nto a worthless dog of a husband who beats her, robs her, and gets\r\ndrunk. All her life centers in her two boys, Basilio and Crispin. They\r\nearn a pittance each, working for the sacristan of a church in another\r\nvillage, ringing the bells and cleaning the chancel. They are to come\r\nhome to-night, and Sisa has been preparing something to please them, a\r\nsupper with things they like to eat, earned by her hard work and\r\nself-denial. She has bought some small fishes, picked the most\r\nbeautiful tomatoes in her little garden (for she knows how fond Crispin\r\nis of tomatoes), and begged from a neighbor some slices of dried wild\r\nboar’s meat and a leg of wild duck. To this she adds the whitest of\r\nrice, which she herself has gleaned from the threshing-floors.\r\n\r\nThen her worthless husband comes in and eats most of the boys’ supper.\r\n\r\nSisa says nothing, although she feels as if she herself were being\r\neaten. His hunger at last appeased, he remembers to ask for the boys.\r\nThen Sisa smiles happily and resolves that she will not eat that night\r\nbecause what remains is not enough for three. The father has asked for\r\nhis sons; for her that is better than a banquet.\r\n\r\nThe boys do not come, and the father goes away. At the church serious\r\ntrouble has fallen upon Basilio and Crispin. The curate has accused\r\nCrispin of stealing and demands restitution; otherwise, the boy, says\r\nthe humane curate, will be beaten to death. That night while their\r\nmother waits for them they are kept ringing the great bells in the\r\nchurch tower, for a storm is raging and it is well known that the sound\r\nof church-bells ringing keeps off the lightning. In the midst of this\r\nemployment, the sacristan suddenly appears, fines the boys for not\r\nringing in tune, renews the accusation of theft (which is quite\r\ngroundless), and drags Crispin off to punishment, locking Basilio in\r\nthe tower. He hears his brother’s cries for help dying out in the\r\ndistance. Then he climbs the belfry, unties the ropes from the bells,\r\nties them to the railing, lets himself out of a window to the ground,\r\nand runs home. But Crispin never appears. He has been shot and killed\r\nby a Civil Guard.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days later Civil Guards come to Sisa’s house and arrest\r\nher for Crispin’s alleged theft. She is paraded through the streets as\r\na common malefactor and locked in the common jail. Basilio has crept to\r\nthe woods. Sisa begins to learn of Crispin’s fate. When she is released\r\nfrom jail she has become insane.\r\n\r\nShe wanders about the country, living on alms and sleeping in the\r\nwoods. Basilio comes home to find her gone and starts in search of her.\r\nWhen at last he comes in sight of her, she in her madness believes him\r\nto be another enemy and flees. He runs after her and overtakes her in\r\ntime to hold her in his arms as she dies.\r\n\r\nThe story of Sisa is interwoven with the development of the story of\r\nIbarra.\r\n\r\nGradually the truth is unfolded to him, the legalized murder of his\r\nfather, the dishonor to his father’s ashes; for, buried in a cemetery,\r\nthe body of the elder Ibarra has been, at the friar’s orders,\r\ndisinterred [73] and cast into the lake. Still he does not quite\r\nperceive what part Damaso has played in this nor understand that he\r\nhimself is pricked next upon the roll of death. Soon or late, he must\r\nlearn all. Then will devolve upon him the duty of vengeance. For\r\nsafety’s sake the friar plans to silence him betimes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the youth, in whom Rizal has typified the large generous\r\nnotions he himself once entertained of Utopia under the rule of Spain,\r\ngives himself to projects for the elevation of his countrymen. He is\r\nimpressed with the darkness of ignorance around him, with the almost\r\ncomic futility of the educational system, which is no system at all.\r\nMeeting an old schoolmaster, he discusses these conditions, and thus is\r\nlaid bare to us the means by which the native mind is kept in its\r\nprison-house.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “How many pupils have you now?” asked Ibarra, with interest, after\r\n    a pause.\r\n\r\n    “More than two hundred on the roll, but only about twenty-five in\r\n    actual attendance.”\r\n\r\n    “How does that happen?”\r\n\r\n    ... The schoolmaster shook his head sadly. “A poor teacher\r\n    struggles against not only prejudice but also against certain\r\n    influences. First, it would be necessary to have a suitable place\r\n    and not to do as I must do at present—hold the classes under the\r\n    convento by the side of the padre’s carriage. There the children,\r\n    who like to read aloud, very naturally disturb the padre, and he\r\n    often comes down, nervous, especially when he has his attacks,\r\n    yells at them, and even insults me. You know that one can neither\r\n    teach nor learn under such conditions....”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curate is the same Father Damaso, the friar with whom Ibarra’s\r\nfather had quarreled. In his overbearing arrogance he has wantonly\r\ninsulted the poor schoolmaster, who goes on thus with his narrative:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “What was I to do with only my meager salary, to collect which I\r\n    have to get the curate’s approval and make a trip to the capital of\r\n    the province—what could I do against him, the foremost religious\r\n    and political power in the town, backed up by his order, feared by\r\n    the Government, rich, powerful, sought after and listened to,\r\n    always believed and heeded by everybody? Although he insulted me, I\r\n    had to remain silent, for if I had replied he would have had me\r\n    removed from my position, by which I should lose all hope in my\r\n    chosen profession. Nor would the cause of education gain anything,\r\n    but all to the contrary; for everybody would take the curate’s\r\n    side, they would curse me and call me presumptuous, proud, vain, a\r\n    bad Christian, uncultivated; and if not those things, then\r\n    ‘anti-Spanish’ and ‘a filibuster.’ Of a schoolmaster neither\r\n    learning nor zeal is expected; only resignation, humility, and\r\n    inaction are demanded. May God pardon me if I have gone against my\r\n    conscience and my judgment, but I was born in this country, I have\r\n    to live, I have a mother; so I have abandoned myself to my fate\r\n    like a corpse tossed about by the waves.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe has tried to abolish whipping in his school. “I endeavored to make\r\nstudy a thing of love and joy, I wished to make the primer not a black\r\nbook bathed in the tears of childhood but a friend that was going to\r\nreveal wonderful secrets; of the school-room not a place of sorrows but\r\na scene of intellectual refreshment. So, little by little, I abolished\r\ncorporal punishment, taking the instruments of it entirely away from\r\nthe school and replacing their stimulus with emulation and personal\r\npride.”\r\n\r\nThe innovation was regarded as sacrilege and heresy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The curate sent for me, and, fearing another scene, I greeted him\r\n    curtly in Tagalog. On this occasion he was very serious with me. He\r\n    said that I was exposing the children to destruction, that I was\r\n    wasting time, that I was not fulfilling my duties, that the father\r\n    who spared the rod was spoiling the child—according to the Holy\r\n    Ghost—that learning enters with the blood, [74] and so on. He\r\n    quoted to me sayings of barbarous times as if it were enough that a\r\n    thing had been said by the ancients to make it indisputable,\r\n    according to which we ought to believe that there really existed\r\n    those monsters which in past ages were imaged and sculptured in the\r\n    palaces and temples. Finally, he charged me to be more careful and\r\n    return to the old system, otherwise he would report me to the\r\n    alcalde of the province.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in despair he brought out the whips again, and sadness reigned in\r\nthe school where he had introduced happiness and work. The number of\r\nhis pupils was reduced to a fifth of the former attendance.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “So then I am now working to the end that the children become\r\n    changed into parrots and know by heart so many things of which they\r\n    do not understand a word.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless a perfect picture of education in the Philippines and\r\noutlines the size of the task that Rizal had shouldered. [75]\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Let us not be so pessimistic,” said Ibarra.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe resolves to build and endow for the town a modern school-house. As\r\nthe time comes for the laying of the corner-stone, at which ceremony he\r\nis to officiate, he receives a mysterious warning that an attempt will\r\nbe made upon his life. This he seemingly disregards; and yet, when he\r\nmust descend into the trench and stand beneath the corner-stone\r\nsuspended from the scaffold, he looks anxiously above him, watches the\r\napparatus, and is tense for a leap. There is a sound of cracking\r\ntimber; in an instant the great stone falls, but he has sprung aside\r\nand saved his life.\r\n\r\nAt the dinner with which the day’s ceremonials are concluded, Padre\r\nDamaso is a conspicuous guest. Not even yet is Ibarra, despite certain\r\nintimations, aware that Damaso was his father’s remorseless enemy, that\r\nthe gloomy, vindictive friar had put forth the hidden powers of the\r\norders and dragged his father to death. But at the dinner Damaso, stung\r\nwith baffled hate because Ibarra has escaped the gin so cunningly\r\nspread for his life, loses all self-control and utters against Ibarra’s\r\nfather an insult no son could be expected to endure. Ibarra springs at\r\nhis throat, knocks him down, and stands glowering over him. In the eyes\r\nof the petrified spectators murder is about to be done, when Maria\r\nClara, Capitán Tiago’s reputed daughter, throws herself between the\r\ninfuriated youth and the prostrate friar.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara is Ibarra’s sweetheart. She pleads with him with her eyes,\r\nand he recovers enough self-command to take himself away.\r\n\r\nBut the assault upon the friar is his ruin. He has committed the\r\nunpardonable sin, the blackest crime in the calendar: he has laid\r\n“violent hand upon a friar, representative at once in his own person of\r\nthe might of the church and the majesty of the realm.” That day he is\r\nexcommunicated, a punishment that in the Philippines, nineteenth\r\ncentury, retained all the poignancy it had in Darkest Europe, 1000 A.D.\r\n\r\nHe has become a moral leper.\r\n\r\nCapitán Tiago breaks off the engagement with his daughter; in his view\r\nthe word of the friars is sacred, oracular, final. He is one of the\r\ngreat portraits of the book, this Capitán Tiago; a typical Filipino of\r\nthe class that bent assiduously at the feet of power. The drawing is\r\nlike many a sketch in Rizal’s note-books, a piece of startling realism.\r\nTiago is a living, talking, sputtering, foolish thing of flesh and\r\nblood that we see and hear. Even though we have never seen another\r\nbeing of his kind anywhere, we see him in this picture-making. He is\r\nvain, pretentious, fearful, abjectly superstitious, filled with strange\r\nnotions about the influences of graven images and the grandeur of\r\nSpain; a Filipino perverted by some wealth, the allurements of a social\r\nambition, and an education grotesquely awry. Against the ills of the\r\nflesh and the chances of loss in the cockpit, he has recourse to the\r\nsame arcana: so many candles burned before this shrine or that, so many\r\nbombs to be exploded at a fiesta, or so many masses bought at current\r\nrates. In all things, to cultivate the favor of the friars is the\r\nboundary of his more earthly philosophy. Ibarra, rich and eminent,\r\nnewly returned from Spain with the gloss of a European education fresh\r\nupon him, is in his eyes a delectable son-in-law. Ibarra under the ban\r\nof the friars is an object of horror.\r\n\r\nThe affection between Ibarra and Maria Clara has the welcome fragrance\r\nof purity and exaltation in the midst of these miasmas. They had been\r\nplaymates in childhood, they had grown up together, they had really\r\nplighted their troth when Ibarra went to Europe. He had been\r\nchivalrously true to her in all his seven years of travel. He has come\r\nback to her sure of her love and looking forward to an early marriage.\r\nUpon all such dreams Tiago sets his foot; he not only forbids any\r\nfurther communication with Ibarra, but he favors another lover, one\r\nLinares, a feeble-willed young Spaniard brought forward with suspicious\r\nhaste by Father Damaso. With this candidate, against the vehement\r\nprotests of Maria Clara, an engagement is quickly made.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the governor-general comes to the town and hears about the\r\ntroubles of Ibarra, whose father he had known and admired. The\r\ngovernor-general is a type of many that Spain sent to the Philippines,\r\nexcellent in purpose, well aware of the malignant fever of friarism,\r\nresolved to withstand it, and invariably finding his good resolutions\r\ncrumbling under him. Yet, in this instance, he will save if he can the\r\nson of his old friend from the clutches of the modern Inquisition.\r\nBetween the friars and the archbishops of Manila is a smoldering feud,\r\nfor the archbishop is usually chosen outside of the four orders. The\r\ngovernor-general nudges the archbishop; the archbishop cancels the\r\nexcommunication; and Ibarra, escaped from this damnation, is doomed by\r\nthe friars to another still worse.\r\n\r\nWith Tiago the lifting of the ban upon Ibarra makes no difference; he\r\nis still anathema to the all-powerful orders. The campaign for Linares\r\nand against Ibarra is waged vigorously with the aid of many candles on\r\nmany shrines and the promises of many bombs. At fiestas, it should be\r\nexplained, the custom was to burn great quantities of fireworks by day\r\nand night; and the piety of the devout, as expressed in squibs,\r\ncrackers, rockets, pin-wheels, and bombs, was supposed to insure their\r\nsalvation. In this form of divine worship, the friars had a commercial\r\ninterest; it may be believed that if a doubt of its perfect efficacy\r\noccurred to them they managed to master it.\r\n\r\nUnder the Spanish social system, Philippine maidens of all complexions\r\nmarried whomsoever their parents told them to marry and silenced their\r\nobjections, if they had any; hence, in the Tiago household the\r\npreparations for the marriage of Maria Clara and the half-witted\r\nLinares are urged with a sweet confidence. Maria Clara herself\r\ncontributes the only flaw in these proceedings. She falls desperately\r\nill.\r\n\r\nNews of her condition is brought to Ibarra by the person in the book\r\ncalled “the Pilot Elias,” who is one of the pivots on which the\r\nnarrative turns. It was Elias that warned Ibarra of the plot to crush\r\nout his life with the corner-stone. In a picnic fishing expedition\r\nIbarra had saved Elias from the jaws of a cayman (crocodile) and Elias\r\nhad sworn his gratitude. He is evidently much above his caste, which is\r\nthat of a boatman; he has had an education. In and out of the story he\r\nflits mysteriously until his true vocation is revealed; he is a man\r\nwith a history, a victim of the prevailing despotism, forced by his\r\nsufferings to ponder the ills of his people and become at last a\r\nsecret, restless, wary, and intelligent agitator against the System of\r\nhis day.\r\n\r\nIt is through him that Rizal voices his protests. As the plot unfolds,\r\nIbarra wins Elias’ story. We shall repeat it here, but with a preface\r\nof warning. In these times, the average reader, the more if he is an\r\nAmerican, will look upon the tale as a wild extravagance, so easily are\r\nthe conditions of one generation obliterated in the next, and so\r\ndifficult is it to believe the life of one country is not like the life\r\nof all countries. Yet what Elias is fabled here to have told Ibarra\r\nmight have been taken with changes of names from veritable records.\r\nExactly these things happened in the Philippine Islands in the\r\nnineteenth century, even in the last decade of the nineteenth century.\r\nThey happened in many regions and to many persons. Still worse things\r\nhappened, if worse can be conceived; for lust and greed and reversion\r\nran savage riot under two conditions that have always been hothouses\r\nfor such growths: autocracy, and distance from the world’s observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ELIAS’ STORY\r\n\r\n    “Some sixty years ago my grandfather dwelt in Manila, being\r\n    employed as a bookkeeper in a Spanish commercial house. He was then\r\n    very young, was married, and had a son. One night, from some\r\n    unknown cause, the warehouse burned down. The fire was communicated\r\n    to the dwelling of his employer and from there to many other\r\n    buildings. The losses were great, a scapegoat was sought, and the\r\n    merchant accused my grandfather. In vain he protested his\r\n    innocence, but he was poor and unable to pay the great lawyers; so\r\n    he was condemned to be flogged publicly and paraded through the\r\n    streets of Manila. Not so very long since they still used the\r\n    infamous method of punishment which the people call ‘caballo y\r\n    vaca,’ and which is a thousand times more dreadful than death\r\n    itself. Abandoned by all except his young wife, my grandfather saw\r\n    himself tied to a horse, followed by an unfeeling crowd, and\r\n    whipped on every street-corner in the sight of men, his brothers,\r\n    and in the neighborhood of numerous temples of a God of peace. When\r\n    the wretch, now for ever disgraced, had satisfied the vengeance of\r\n    man with his blood, his tortures, and his cries, he had to be taken\r\n    off the horse, for he had become unconscious. Would to God that he\r\n    had died! But by one of those refinements of cruelty he was given\r\n    his liberty. His wife, pregnant at the time, vainly begged from\r\n    door to door for work or alms in order to care for her sick husband\r\n    and their poor son, but who would trust the wife of an incendiary\r\n    and a disgraced man? The wife, then, had to become a prostitute!”\r\n\r\n    Ibarra rose in his seat.\r\n\r\n    “Oh, don’t get excited! Prostitution was not now a dishonor for her\r\n    or a disgrace to her husband; for them honor and shame no longer\r\n    existed. The husband recovered from his wounds and came with his\r\n    wife and child to hide himself in the mountains of this province.\r\n    Here they lived several months, miserable, alone, hated and shunned\r\n    by all. The wife gave birth to a sickly child, which fortunately\r\n    died. Unable to endure such misery and being less courageous than\r\n    his wife, my grandfather, in despair at seeing his sick wife\r\n    deprived of all care and assistance, hanged himself. His corpse\r\n    rotted in sight of the son, who was scarcely able to care for his\r\n    sick mother, and the stench from it led to their discovery. Her\r\n    husband’s death was attributed to her, for of what is the wife of a\r\n    wretch, a woman who has been a prostitute besides, not believed to\r\n    be capable? If she swears, they call her a perjurer; if she weeps,\r\n    they say she is acting; and that she blasphemes when she calls on\r\n    God. Nevertheless, they had pity on her condition and waited for\r\n    the birth of another child before they flogged her. You know how\r\n    the friars spread the belief that the Indians can only be managed\r\n    by blows: read what Padre Gaspar de San Agustin says!\r\n\r\n    “A woman thus condemned will curse the day on which her child is\r\n    born, and this, besides prolonging her torture, violates every\r\n    maternal sentiment. Unfortunately, she brought forth a healthy\r\n    child. Two months afterward, the sentence was executed to the great\r\n    satisfaction of the men who thought that thus they were performing\r\n    their duty. Not being at peace in these mountains, she then fled\r\n    with her two sons to a neighboring province, where they lived like\r\n    wild beasts, hating and hated. The elder of the two boys still\r\n    remembered, even amid so much misery, the happiness of his infancy,\r\n    so he became a tulisan as soon as he found himself strong enough.\r\n    Before long the bloody name of Bâlat spread from province to\r\n    province, a terror to the people, because in his revenge he did\r\n    everything with blood and fire. The younger, who was by nature\r\n    kind-hearted, resigned himself to his shameful fate along with his\r\n    mother, and they lived on what the woods afforded, clothing\r\n    themselves in the cast-off rags of travelers. She had lost her\r\n    name, being known only as the convict, the prostitute, the\r\n    scourged. He was known as the son of his mother only, because the\r\n    gentleness of his disposition led every one to believe that he was\r\n    not the son of the incendiary and because any doubt as to the\r\n    morality of the Indios can be held reasonable.\r\n\r\n    “At last, one day the notorious Bâlat fell into the clutches of the\r\n    authorities, who exacted of him a strict accounting for his crimes,\r\n    and of his mother for having done nothing to rear him properly. One\r\n    morning the younger brother went to look for his mother, who had\r\n    gone into the woods to gather mushrooms and had not returned. He\r\n    found her stretched out on the ground under a cotton-wood tree\r\n    beside the highway, her face turned toward the sky, her eyes fixed\r\n    and staring, her clenched hands buried in the blood-stained earth.\r\n    Some impulse moved him to look up in the direction toward which the\r\n    eyes of the dead woman were staring, and he saw hanging from a\r\n    branch a basket and in the basket the gory head of his brother!”\r\n\r\n    “My God!” ejaculated Ibarra.\r\n\r\n    “That might have been the exclamation of my father,” continued\r\n    Elias coldly. “The body of the brigand had been cut up and the\r\n    trunk buried, but his limbs were distributed and hung up in\r\n    different towns. If ever you go from Calamba to Santo Tomas you\r\n    will still see a withered lomboy-tree where one of my uncle’s legs\r\n    hung rotting—nature has blasted the tree so that it no longer grows\r\n    or bears fruit. The same was done with the other limbs, but the\r\n    head, as the best part of the person and the portion most easily\r\n    recognizable, was hung up in front of his mother’s hut!”\r\n\r\n    Ibarra bowed his head.\r\n\r\n    “The boy fled like one accursed,” Elias went on. “He fled from town\r\n    to town by mountain and valley. When he thought that he had reached\r\n    a place where he was not known, he hired himself out as a laborer\r\n    in the house of a rich man in the province of Tayabas. His activity\r\n    and the gentleness of his character gained him the good will of all\r\n    that did not know his past, and by his thrift and economy he\r\n    succeeded in accumulating a little capital. He was still young, he\r\n    thought his sorrows buried in the past, and he dreamed of a happy\r\n    future. His pleasant appearance, his youth, and his somewhat\r\n    unfortunate condition won him the love of a young woman of the\r\n    town, but he dared not ask for her hand from fear that his past\r\n    might become known. But love is stronger than anything else, and\r\n    they wandered from the straight path; so, to save the woman’s\r\n    honor, he risked everything by asking her in marriage. The records\r\n    were sought, and his whole past became known. The girl’s father was\r\n    rich and succeeded in having him prosecuted. He did not try to\r\n    defend himself but admitted everything, and so was sent to prison.\r\n    The woman gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, who were nurtured\r\n    in secret and made to believe that their father was dead—no\r\n    difficult matter, since at a tender age they saw their mother die,\r\n    and they gave little thought to tracing genealogies. As our\r\n    maternal grandfather was rich our childhood passed happily. My\r\n    sister and I were brought up together, loving one another as only\r\n    twins can love when they have no other affections. When quite young\r\n    I was sent to study in the Jesuit College; and my sister, in order\r\n    that we might not be completely separated, entered the Concordia\r\n    College. After our brief education was finished, since we desired\r\n    only to be farmers, we returned to the town to take possession of\r\n    the inheritance left us by our grandfather. We lived happily for a\r\n    time, the future smiled on us, we had many servants, our fields\r\n    produced abundant harvests, and my sister was about to be married\r\n    to a young man whom she adored and who responded equally to her\r\n    affection.\r\n\r\n    “But in a dispute over money and by reason of my haughty\r\n    disposition at that time, I alienated the good will of a distant\r\n    relative, and one day he cast in my face my doubtful birth and\r\n    shameful descent. I thought it all a slander and demanded\r\n    satisfaction. The tomb which covered so much rottenness was again\r\n    opened, and to my consternation the whole truth came out to\r\n    overwhelm me. To add to our sorrow, we had had for many years an\r\n    old servant who had endured all my whims without ever leaving us,\r\n    contenting himself merely with weeping and groaning at the rough\r\n    jests of the other servants. I don’t know how my relative had found\r\n    it out, but the fact is that he had this old man summoned into\r\n    court and made him tell the truth—that old servant, who had clung\r\n    to his beloved children, and whom I had abused many times, was my\r\n    father! Our happiness faded away, I gave up our fortune, my sister\r\n    lost her betrothed, and with our father we left the town to seek\r\n    refuge elsewhere. The thought that he had contributed to our\r\n    misfortunes shortened the old man’s days, but before he died I\r\n    learned from his lips the whole story of the sorrowful past.\r\n\r\n    “My sister and I were left alone. She wept a great deal, but, even\r\n    in the midst of such great sorrows as heaped themselves upon us,\r\n    she could not forget her love. Without complaining, without\r\n    uttering a word, she saw her former sweetheart married to another\r\n    girl; but I watched her gradually sicken without being able to\r\n    console her. One day she disappeared and it was in vain that I\r\n    sought everywhere, in vain I made inquiries about her. About six\r\n    months afterward I learned that about that time, after a flood on\r\n    the lake, there had been found in some rice-fields bordering on the\r\n    beach at Calamba the corpse of a young woman who had been either\r\n    drowned or murdered, for she had had, so they said, a knife\r\n    sticking in her breast. The officials of that town published the\r\n    fact in the country round about; but no one came to claim the body,\r\n    no young woman apparently had disappeared. From the description\r\n    they gave me afterward of her dress, her ornaments, the beauty of\r\n    her countenance, and her abundant hair, I recognized in her my poor\r\n    sister.\r\n\r\n    “Since then I have wandered from province to province. My\r\n    reputation and my history are in the mouths of many. They attribute\r\n    great deeds to me, sometimes calumniating me, but I pay little\r\n    attention to men, keeping ever on my way. Such in brief is my\r\n    story, a story of one of the judgments of men.”\r\n\r\n    Elias fell silent as he rowed along.\r\n\r\n    “I still believe that you are not wrong,” murmured Crisóstomo\r\n    [Ibarra] in a low voice, “when you say that justice should seek to\r\n    do good by rewarding virtue and educating the criminals. Only, it’s\r\n    impossible, Utopian! And where could be secured so much money, so\r\n    many new employees?”\r\n\r\n    “For what, then, are the priests who proclaim their mission of\r\n    peace and charity? Is it more meritorious to moisten the head of a\r\n    child with water, to give it salt to eat, than to awake in the\r\n    benighted conscience of a criminal that spark which God has granted\r\n    to every man to light him to his welfare? Is it more humane to\r\n    accompany a criminal to the scaffold than to lead him along the\r\n    difficult path from vice to virtue? Don’t they also pay spies,\r\n    executioners, Civil-Guards? These things, besides being dirty, also\r\n    cost money.”\r\n\r\n    “My friend, neither you nor I, although we may wish it, can\r\n    accomplish this.”\r\n\r\n    “Alone, it is true, we are nothing, but take up the cause of the\r\n    people, unite yourself with the people, be not heedless of their\r\n    cries, set an example to the rest, spread the idea of what is\r\n    called a fatherland!”\r\n\r\n    “What the people ask for is impossible. We must wait.”\r\n\r\n    “Wait! To wait means to suffer!”\r\n\r\n    “If I should ask for it, the powers that be would laugh at me.”\r\n\r\n\r\nElias desires Ibarra to put himself at the head of the people and\r\nsecure their emancipation from these horrors. Ibarra draws back; all\r\nthe instincts of his class and the prejudices of his education are\r\nagainst anything of that kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “But if the people support you?” said Elias.\r\n\r\n    “Never! I will never be the one to lead the multitude to get by\r\n    force what the Government does not think proper to grant, no! If I\r\n    should ever see the multitude armed I would place myself on the\r\n    side of the Government, for in such a mob I should not see my\r\n    countrymen. I desire the country’s welfare; therefore I would build\r\n    a school-house. I seek it by means of instruction, by progressive\r\n    advancement; without light there is no road.”\r\n\r\n    “Neither is there liberty without strife!” answered Elias.\r\n\r\n    “The fact is that I don’t want that liberty!”\r\n\r\n    “The fact is that without liberty there is no light,” replied the\r\n    pilot with warmth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is like a conversation in Rizal’s own heart between the spirit of\r\nthe college and the spirit of his country. Into it, beyond a doubt, he\r\nput the conflict that was torturing his soul. The spirit of love and\r\ngood will in him grappling like Jacob with the soul that told him that\r\nfrom oppressions by violence could come only revolt by violence.\r\n\r\nIt may be profitable to follow this farther. It is a page of Rizal’s\r\nown revealing always overlooked by those that insist he was opposed to\r\nPhilippine independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “You may say [the pilot goes on] that you are only slightly\r\n    acquainted with your country, and I believe you. You don’t see the\r\n    struggle that is preparing; you don’t see the cloud on the horizon.\r\n    The fight is beginning in the sphere of ideas, to descend later\r\n    into the arena, which will be dyed with blood. I hear the voice of\r\n    God—woe unto them who would oppose it! For them history has not\r\n    been written!”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one can believe Rizal wrote this without feeling it in his heart and\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Elias was transfigured; standing uncovered, with his manly face\r\n    illuminated by the moon, there was something extraordinary about\r\n    him. He shook his long hair and went on:\r\n\r\n    “Don’t you see how everything is awakening? The sleep has lasted\r\n    for centuries, but one day the thunderbolt struck, and, in\r\n    striking, infused life.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe means the slaying of the guiltless priests, Fathers Burgos, Gomez,\r\nand Zamora, victims to the homicidal mania that descended upon the\r\nGovernment after the revolt of 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Since then [the pilot continues] new tendencies are stirring our\r\n    spirits, and these tendencies, to-day scattered, will some day be\r\n    united, guided by the God who has not failed other peoples, and who\r\n    will not fail us, for his cause is the cause of liberty!” [76]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trap the friars have prepared for Ibarra is a thing infamous in\r\nPhilippine history, and yet so common that in fact and not in fiction\r\nit has sent scores of innocent men to their deaths. It had never been\r\nknown to fail. Agents provocateurs stage a pretended revolt. Nothing is\r\neasier; the materials are always to hand; likewise the occasion. It is\r\nbut necessary to take the latest outrage by the Civil Guard and stir\r\nsome one to object to it. The rest follows automatically. In this\r\ninstance Ibarra is the pretended instigator, although he has never\r\nheard of the wrong he is supposed to resent.\r\n\r\nElias warns him of what is afoot and urges him to escape; innocent as\r\nhe is, he shall have no chance for his life before the tribunal that\r\nwill try him if he waits for arrest. He will not go until he has had\r\nword with Maria Clara. The last scene between them is excellent drama;\r\nhe gets under her window in a boat and climbs up the vines. For the\r\ncharge of complicity in the stage rebellion is no basis except a letter\r\nthat seven years before he had written to her. Some phrases that might\r\nbe construed to suggest a vague discontent with conditions in the\r\nPhilippines make up the entire case. On slighter evidence many a man\r\nhas been tortured first and gone next to the Golgotha at Bagumbayan\r\nField. The friars have this letter. How did they get it when for so\r\nmany years it had been one of the dearest possessions of Maria Clara?\r\nIbarra can surmise only that she has willingly surrendered it and so\r\nbetrayed him. In that last interview he learns that it was filched from\r\nher by the friar Silva, whose interest in her has been more than\r\necclesiastical and who on the same occasion has disclosed to her the\r\nfacts as to her own parentage.\r\n\r\nShe is not the daughter of Capitán Tiago but of Father Damaso—an\r\nillegitimate daughter.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that she is innocent, Ibarra now consents to escape from his\r\nfoes. Elias, the pilot, who has so often befriended him, is waiting\r\nbelow in the banca. They row up the Pasig River. When they approach a\r\nsoldier, Ibarra hides himself in the bottom of the boat under the\r\nfreight. At last the Civil Guards are in pursuit. Elias tries to escape\r\nby hard rowing. The Guards begin to fire. Elias slips overboard. Taking\r\nhim for Ibarra, the Guards follow in their banca, firing constantly.\r\nThe hunted man is seen to sink. When the Guards come up they think they\r\nsee blood. They take the news back to Manila that Ibarra, the desperate\r\nrevolutionist, trying to escape, has been shot and killed. At the word\r\nMaria Clara gives up all earthly hope and flees to a nunnery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLEONORA RIVERA\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the title of his novel Rizal meant not that he was touching a person\r\nforbidden, but a subject. The words he had found in a Latin version of\r\nthe New Testament in the passage where the risen Christ is beheld by\r\nMary Magdalene; but he used these words in a sense wholly different\r\nfrom the scriptural significance. Conditions in the Philippines he had\r\nthought of as having become a social cancer that persisted first\r\nbecause of a notion that nobody must treat or touch it. Of all the men\r\nof his times and country, he was the only man that had the courage to\r\nbreak through this barrier and the skill and perfect knowledge to\r\ndissect the hideous growth behind.\r\n\r\nWith one of the first copies that came from the press he wrote to his\r\nclose friend, Dr. Blumentritt, a letter in which he lays bare his own\r\nidea of his work: [77]\r\n\r\n\r\n    The novel [he says] tells of many things that until now have not\r\n    been touched upon. They are so peculiar to ourselves that we have\r\n    been sensitive about them. In this book I have attempted what no\r\n    one else seems to have been willing to do. For one thing, I have\r\n    dared to answer the calumnies that for centuries have been heaped\r\n    upon us and upon our country. I have written of the social\r\n    condition of the Philippines and of the life of the Filipinos. I\r\n    have told the truth about our beliefs, our hopes, our longings, our\r\n    complaints, and our sorrows. I have tried to show the difference\r\n    between real religion and the hypocrisy that under its cloak has\r\n    impoverished and brutalized us. I have brought out the real meaning\r\n    of the dazzling and deceptive words of our countrymen. I have\r\n    related our mistakes, our vices, and our faults. I have exposed how\r\n    weakly we accept miseries as inevitable. Where there has been\r\n    reason for it, I have given praise. I have not wept over our\r\n    misfortunes, but rather laughed at them.\r\n\r\n    No one would want to read a book full of tears, and then, too,\r\n    laughter is the best means of concealing sorrow.\r\n\r\n    The incidents that I have related are all true and have actually\r\n    occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut for his habitual reticence about himself he might have said much\r\nmore; if he had known his own powers he might have spoken of his\r\nlifelike delineations; he might have urged a gift like prophecy. All\r\nthe impression of a strong personal relation one has throughout the\r\nreading of “Noli Me Tangere” is well founded. Into it Rizal was writing\r\nhimself. Ibarra was a prefiguration, in some respects marvelously\r\naccurate, of himself in the days at hand when he should return to his\r\nnative country. Of the material of the book the greater part had been\r\nverified in his own experiences. The imprisonment of Ibarra’s father\r\nwas the story of Rizal’s own mother. Father Damaso he had seen and\r\nwatched, and Father Silva no less. In Tasio, the philosophical\r\nevolutionist, he had but drawn his own elder brother, Paciano. But\r\nabove all, the story of Maria Clara was a tragedy from his own life; at\r\nthat time a tragedy he might have feared but had not as yet\r\nexperienced, strange as that may seem.\r\n\r\nMaria Clara is Rizal’s cousin, Leonora Rivera, his sweetheart and first\r\ngreat disappointment. She was born in Camiling, province of Tarlac, on\r\nApril 11, 1867, the daughter of Antonio Rivera, who was Rizal’s uncle,\r\nbenefactor, and ardent partisan. [78] She was twelve years old when the\r\nfamily moved to Manila, where they rented lodgings to students in Santo\r\nTomas and the Ateneo. Among these, after a time, came Cousin José\r\nRizal, at about the third shifting of his quarters in Manila. Leonora\r\nwas enrolled as an undergraduate at Concordia College for girls, where\r\nRizal’s youngest sister, Soledad, was likewise a student. He would\r\nsometimes spend a half-holiday at Concordia to see and to amuse his\r\nsister, whereupon he and his beautiful cousin became good friends,\r\nalthough she was six years his junior. She was not only beautiful, but\r\nshe seems to have had an unusual intellect of the kind that would be\r\nlikely to attract Rizal; for she was in fact, and not by repute alone,\r\nstudious, thoughtful, of the Malay seriousness, but with also the Malay\r\ndelight in music. She sang well; she is said to have played the piano\r\nwith a skill that distinguished her even in the corps of able pianists\r\nof which Concordia was proud. If so, the eminence was not lightly won;\r\nfor the worthy Sisters that conducted that institution taught music\r\nthoroughly and well.\r\n\r\nShe must have been also of a sweet and gentle spirit; all the memories\r\nextant of her twenty years after her death included this tribute. The\r\nvarious commentators that have differed often about other phases of\r\nPhilippine life have been of one mind in praising the typical educated\r\nFilipino woman and yet have not exaggerated her worth. In a world\r\nwearied of artificiality, her simple sincerity shines to cheer as much\r\nas to charm. Visitors that have observed her well have usually noted\r\nthe excellence of her mind, the honesty of her walk, and the reserve\r\nstrength of her character. Rizal’s mother was of this order, the\r\ndiligent ruler of the household, the laborious instructor of her\r\nchildren; and, when the blows of the Spanish tyranny fell upon her\r\nhead, bearing them with the proud fortitude of a Roman matron of the\r\nrepublic. Doubtless, the halo of Rizal and Leonora’s own romantic story\r\nhave magnified her intellectual stature; yet when all allowance is made\r\nfor exaggeration that may color the work of a friendly biographer, the\r\nfact is apparent that she also was of this same admirable womanhood.\r\n\r\nThe first time she seems to have suspected in herself a feeling for her\r\nhandsome young cousin stronger than cousinly regard was on a day at her\r\nfather’s house when the young leader of the Filipino forces at the\r\nAteneo was brought in with a broken head and covered with dust, blood,\r\nand glory. It was not the first time he had been so ornamented, but\r\nonly the first time she had seen him thus. At the sight of the youthful\r\nchampion of the Filipino people disabled early in the fray, Leonora ran\r\nwith speed to get warm water and bandages to dress his hurts. The rest\r\nwas easy and according to the formulæ for such cases well known and\r\naccepted. She loved him for the battles he waged, and he loved her that\r\nshe nursed him so tenderly.\r\n\r\nA year later with the full approbation of their parents they were\r\nbetrothed. Mr. Rivera was fond of his nephew; to the aunt, José was at\r\nleast not objectionable, though she seems to have been a lady of a\r\ncaptious and changeable temperament. It was the uncle that first\r\nsuggested Rizal’s withdrawal from the Philippines when it became\r\nevident that the governing class had marked him as a young man to be\r\nsuppressed. Mr. Rivera knew well enough what that would mean in Santo\r\nTomas and elsewhere: every avenue closed, every possible obstacle\r\nthrown in his way. The malice he had aroused he could hope to defeat in\r\nsome measure if he could win in Europe a training and a distinction\r\nthat would on his return provide him with a practice in spite of\r\nSpanish opposition. Mr. Rivera assisted his flight, sent him money\r\nwhile he was pursuing his studies in Madrid, and showed at all times a\r\nsincere interest in his welfare. The lovers had a tender parting just\r\nbefore Rizal went aboard his ship that night; as a sign or image of his\r\npresence when he should be far away he left with her a poem that began:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The summons sounds, predestinate and grim,\r\n      The iron clanging of the tongue of fate,\r\n    That drives me on a pathway strange and dim\r\n      And strikes my flowers of hope all desolate.\r\n\r\n    Thou know’st,—thou other, dearer soul of mine—\r\n      How hard it is to say farewell, and part;\r\n    Through clouds that darken, suns that shine,\r\n      I venture—but I leave with thee my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Madrid he wrote her regularly and with deep affection and received\r\nreplies that, his diary says, gave him unbounded joy, as these entries\r\nindicate:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1884. January 10. Received two letters, one from Uncle Antonio\r\n    [Leonora’s father] and the other from L. Nov. 30. The letter from\r\n    Leonora was lovely with a sweet ending.\r\n\r\n    January 25. To-night I had a sad dream. I returned to the\r\n    Philippines, but oh, what a sad reception! Leonora had been\r\n    unfaithful; an inexcusable unfaithfulness without any remedy.\r\n\r\n    April 13. To-day I received letters from Leonora, Uncle Antonio,\r\n    and Changoy. I am well satisfied with what Leonora writes but not\r\n    with her state of health. [79]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo trait is more to be emphasized in observing the Filipino people than\r\ntheir respect for womanhood. It is hardly less than phenomenal. In\r\nBurma the women may have as much power; in Filipinas they have power\r\nand respect as well as affection. Rizal was all of this order; the most\r\nsacred object in the world was his mother; the next most sacred the\r\nwoman that should be his wife; after her came his sisters. He had\r\ndeveloped in advance of his times a certain philosophy of feminism that\r\nhas since become much more general. In his letters he dwelt upon it. He\r\nthought the Filipino woman might be one of the great instruments for\r\nthe deliverance of the country, exercising her power and influence\r\nconscientiously for education and liberty. Therefore, every Filipino\r\nwoman ought to prepare herself for this service by utilizing every road\r\nto knowledge and enlarging her understanding of the nation and its\r\npossibilities. He believed that a general effort on these lines by the\r\neducated women would make a profound impression upon the young and be\r\ninvaluable in the next generation.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been no flaw in his attachment to Leonora; his\r\ncareer abroad has been searched in vain for a reminiscence of an\r\nescapade. He lived a life of purity and that self-control that he held\r\nto be the first demand of the moral code he professed. Seldom has the\r\nbiographer a career like this to write in which appears not enough of\r\nhuman frailty to spice the narrative. He had made for himself certain\r\nrules of conduct—abstemiousness, temperance, chastity, no wasting of\r\ntime, no wasting of health—and to these he adhered with the stern\r\ninflexibility of an ascetic. The artist is usually saved, says Edmund\r\nClarence Stedman, by his devotion to beauty. Rizal was an artist, and\r\nnever has knelt before the ideal of beauty a worshiper more devout. The\r\nbeauty of righteousness seemed to rule out of him all promptings to the\r\ncoltish excesses of youth; that, and the dignity of his love, and his\r\nconception of the gravity of his mission. He that is called to bring\r\nlight to his people must not linger at the wayside inn nor ruin their\r\nhopes by capitulation to man’s grosser senses.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Riveras had moved from Manila to Dagupan, in the province\r\nthen called Laguna. The reputation that Rizal had left behind him was\r\nnot bettered by the handling it had from the governing class after his\r\nflight. Evil propaganda has always been easy to great power in any\r\nform. In his absence the spies and agents provocateurs of the\r\nGovernment made it but the day’s work to smear with lies the name of\r\nRizal. “Some of it will stick,” is the philosophy of the professional\r\nslanderer. In this case the word proved true enough. Mrs. Rivera seems\r\nto have been much affected by the sad decline and fall of her\r\nprospective son-in-law. She was an excellent lady but one that set\r\nexaggerated store by the verdict of society and what Shelley called the\r\ngreat god “They Say.” Among all colonists everywhere this is a deity of\r\nmight. With the slender group of Filipinos that strove to grasp the\r\nskirts of a society drawn disdainfully away from them, the cult\r\namounted sometimes to a frenzy.\r\n\r\nThe reports that came from Madrid about Leonora’s lover, or were\r\naffirmed to come thence, were no salve to the mother’s wounded\r\nsensibilities. He was said to associate with sad young dogs,\r\nrevolutionists and outcasts and all that, with Filipinos that had been\r\nexiled after the governmental sand-dance of 1872 and with other\r\nagencies of treason. The thought of the career that such a man would\r\nprobably have in the Philippines seems to have struck Mrs. Rivera with\r\ninexpressible terror. What her friends and social co-mates would say\r\nwhen her daughter should be married to one sure to be a pariah if not a\r\nvictim of the garrote was beyond her strength to endure.\r\n\r\nShe had also the strange notion that steals into the minds of some\r\nsubjugated people that intermarriage with the dominant color promises\r\nrelief from the sting of inferiority. About this time the railroad was\r\nbeing extended to Dagupan, and a young English engineer, Henry C.\r\nKipping, came to take charge of the building of the last section of the\r\nnew line from Bayambang. His work took him often to Dagupan, where he\r\nmet and fell in love with Leonora. He seems to have urged his suit with\r\nardor and persistence and to have had from the beginning an adroit\r\npartisan in Leonora’s mother. Here had come, as if by the order of\r\nProvidence, a means to save her daughter from an unhappy marriage. How\r\nmuch better to wed an English engineer than a Filipino agitator! With\r\njoy she seized every opportunity to praise the ingenious Kipping, gave\r\nthanks (for she was of a resolute devotion) to the wisdom that had\r\narranged all this, and even prepared to give it help of her own\r\ndevising. [80]\r\n\r\nCold fell her eulogies on Leonora’s ears. When Kipping talked love to\r\nher she told him frankly that she was engaged to marry Rizal, whom she\r\nloved and would always love, and that another suitor was for her\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nNothing in Kipping’s reports of these chilly receptions daunted Mrs.\r\nRivera, her heart being set on this match. She knew well the weight of\r\nparental authority among her people. Also, she had faith in the effects\r\nof absence, if judiciously interpreted and assisted. She can hardly\r\nhave read the novels of Charles Reade, but that eminent author would\r\nhave found in her a character all made to his mind. She now had resort\r\nto an expedient that was one of favorite practice among his own\r\nvillains. Many a reader of his it has left cold, deeming it impossible\r\nor extravagant. Behold, then, vindication for the novelist, and\r\nstraight from history. Mrs. Rivera augmented the glacial effects of\r\nseparation by stopping all letters between the young lovers. To this\r\nend she bribed two postal clerks. [81] For a monthly stipend they\r\nagreed to bring to her all the letters that Leonora wrote to José and\r\nall the letters that José wrote to Leonora.\r\n\r\nMonths went by and not a word came from Madrid. Leonora began to droop\r\nunder the suspense. Skilfully and industriously her mother plied her\r\nwith insinuations and the wise shaking of the head so eloquent to the\r\nanxious. We could and if we would, and that line of ambiguous givings\r\nout. At last, she openly declared that Rizal had found another\r\nsweetheart. Leonora hysterically affirmed her faith in her lover. But\r\nthe physical fact persisted that mail after mail arrived from Spain and\r\nnot a line from Rizal. “He is sick,” said Leonora, “and I am here, I\r\ncannot take care of him.” The next time the expected letter failed she\r\nsaid deliberately, “I know José. He has given his word. He will die\r\nbefore he breaks it.”\r\n\r\nThe mother seems to have known how to beat down this spirit. At last\r\nshe brought to an issue the slow, sure undermining in which she had\r\nbeen employing her wits. “If you truly love me, you ought to remember\r\nthat, after God, you owe to me all you are, and after God, then, you\r\nowe me your duty. I urge this marriage, not because it means anything\r\nto me, but because I am your mother. I seek your true happiness. All\r\nthe hope of my life is centered upon it. Do you wish to kill your\r\nmother?”\r\n\r\nAt this, Leonora capitulated. So great is the maternal influence in the\r\nFilipino household it is likely that most other Filipino girls in the\r\nsame conditions would have yielded. According to Miss Sevilla,\r\nLeonora’s sympathetic biographer, the daughter now fell into the\r\nmother’s arms and said:\r\n\r\n“I owe you my life; I will sacrifice it for you, and make this marriage\r\nas you wish, but you will find that I shall not live long after it. In\r\nreturn, I ask you three things, that I shall not again be asked to play\r\nor to sing, that my piano shall be kept locked, and that you shall be\r\nat my side when I am married.” [82]\r\n\r\nThe next day she burned the letters she had received from Rizal before\r\nher mother had interfered with her happiness. Following a Filipino\r\ncustom, she put the ashes into a little box which she covered with a\r\npiece of the dress she had worn when she was betrothed and a piece of\r\nthe dress she had worn when she yielded to her mother about Kipping.\r\nThe box is still in existence. It bears on its covers the letters “J”\r\nand “L” worked in gold. [83]\r\n\r\nThe wedding was fixed for June 17, at Dagupan. A few days before this\r\ndate, Mrs. Rivera was called to Manila by some business transaction in\r\nwhich she must take a part. She seems to have forgotten the postal\r\nclerks, or they to have forgotten their employment; for while she was\r\ngone a letter arrived from Rizal to Leonora, and it fell into her\r\nhands. She opened it with wonder and trembling, and lo! it was filled\r\nwith tender reproaches for her long silence. He had written to her\r\nregularly by every mail, but all these months had come not a word in\r\nanswer. Had she forgotten him?\r\n\r\nThe next scene may be deemed to justify the writers both of fiction and\r\nof melodrama. Leonora waited in silence until her mother returned from\r\nManila, for her quick intelligence showed her unerringly who had been\r\nthe author of this wreck of her happiness. The moment her mother opened\r\nthe door the storm broke. Leonora, for once, defied the restraint the\r\nFilipino girl must traditionally feel in the presence of her parents\r\nand spared nobody in her passionate denunciation of the treachery of\r\nwhich she had been the victim. Mrs. Rivera seems to have admitted\r\neverything and borne with composure the whirlwind of her daughter’s\r\nwrath. She knew that the discovery had come too late to disturb her own\r\nsuccess. The wedding was close at hand, the banns had been cried, the\r\nguests invited, the peculiar Filipino pride was involved and her\r\ndaughter would hold to her word.\r\n\r\nKipping was baptized and became a Catholic. The wedding took place at\r\nthe appointed hour. Afterward some of her relatives recalled that it\r\nwas a ceremony without joy or good omens. They said that from it the\r\nbride returned in a state of chill lassitude. Contrary to her mother’s\r\nhopes, the marriage proved unhappy, and Leonora survived it only two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nAGAIN IN THE PHILIPPINES\r\n\r\n\r\nStill unaware of the ruin that had come upon his hopes, Rizal was\r\nliving in Berlin and working on the last chapters of “Noli Me Tangere.”\r\nHe had taken cheap lodging in one of those huge modern German\r\napartment-houses, in the complex depths of which he could bury himself,\r\npress on with his work, and be as remote as Tahaiti. He had known from\r\nthe beginning that he must bring out his book at his own expense, poor\r\nas he was, if it was to be published at all. To a European publisher\r\nthe subject would seem too unconventional and outlandish; and as for\r\nthe Philippines, not a printer there would venture on his life to so\r\nmuch as look at it. The type was set (in Spanish) in a small job-office\r\nnot far from Rizal’s lodging. Of the report that he himself eked out\r\nhis remittances by working at times as a compositor in this shop, there\r\nis no satisfactory evidence; he had not previously appeared as a\r\nprinter, but with his marvelous dexterity and ease in assimilating all\r\nknowledge he might have picked up even this craft, too, with others,\r\ndifficult as it is. If so, he may have enjoyed in Berlin an unusual\r\nexperience. He may have been an author putting into type his own copy.\r\n\r\nOne problem had harassed him. Whence could he hope to get the money to\r\npay for the publication? He was still largely supported by remittances\r\nfrom home, from Paciano the ever faithful, from other members of his\r\nfamily; but these were not more than enough to keep him alive. The\r\nFates that packed his wallet so full of other good gifts seem to have\r\nomitted a facility in making money, but supplied in its stead an\r\nabnormal power of self-denial. He now started out to save the sum he\r\nneeded by inciting the spirit to triumph over the flesh. About this\r\ntime there came to visit him in Berlin Maximo Viola, a wealthy and\r\nexcellent young Filipino he had known in Madrid. Viola records that he\r\nfound the young author living in a rear room and subsisting upon one\r\nmeal a day, largely bread and coffee, [84] which were cheap.\r\n\r\nThe raven had come that was not only to feed this prophet but to lead\r\nhim out of the wilderness. Viola’s object had been to invite Rizal to\r\ngo with him upon a walking tour through rural Germany and Switzerland.\r\nAt the proposal, Rizal’s eyes blazed; no project could be more alluring\r\nto him, as Viola had well known. Then he said that it was impossible;\r\nhe could not go. Why impossible? asked Viola. Native pride forbade any\r\ndirect answer, but Viola extracted the truth. He was saving money to\r\npublish a book. What kind of a book? Rizal told him, whereupon the\r\nFilipino blood stirred in Viola’s veins also, and he offered on the\r\nspot to advance enough money to bring out the book and then enough to\r\ntake Rizal on the walking tour.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, “Noli Me Tangere,” a finished novel of five hundred\r\npages, was printed and bound and launched upon its eventful way. [85]\r\n\r\nThe facts about this man would stagger credulity if they were not of so\r\nsure and recent record. This novel of his contains more than two\r\nhundred thousand words. He obtained his medical licentiate at Madrid in\r\nJune, 1885, and nothing of his book had been written then; nothing was\r\nwritten until months later. After a time he went to Paris, where he was\r\nemployed as a clinical assistant to a busy oculist and also in pursuing\r\nhis studies. Thence he went first to Heidelberg, then to Leipzig, where\r\nhe entered the universities. Next we find him in Berlin, again an\r\nactive and laborious student. Yet “Noli Me Tangere” was completed on\r\nFebruary 21, 1887. The thing does not seem to be in nature. We cannot\r\nrecall another instance in literature of such rapid composition under\r\nthe like conditions of distraction.\r\n\r\nIt was a stormy petrel that he had set free, and trouble began early\r\nbecause of and around it. His first object was to circulate it in the\r\nPhilippines. Nothing could have been more unpromising, with a\r\ncensorship keeping watch and ward and an author loathed and feared by\r\nthe whole System. Yet he accomplished the difficult feat. He had stout\r\nfriends in Barcelona and Madrid, Fernando Canon, Mariano Ponce, Damaso\r\nPonce, Ramon Batle, and, in especial, Teresina Batle, who was Mr.\r\nCanon’s sweetheart. Her quick wit helped the conspiracy. Rizal sent to\r\nMr. Batle certain boxes containing copies of his book. These his\r\nfriends disguised as dry-goods and the like innocent freight and\r\nforwarded to Manila. Ramon Eguarras and Alejandro Rojas were Manila\r\nproprietors of substance and good repute. They smuggled the boxes past\r\nthe official Argus and before his very face. [86] When the authorities\r\nawoke, the fierce new appeal was going from house to house with ominous\r\nrumblings in its wake.\r\n\r\nThis could not last long. To know what the submerged people were\r\nreading and thinking was one of the chief businesses of the bureau of\r\nspies and department of sleuthing. Soon the censor was hot upon the\r\ntrail of this omen of unrest. A copy of the book was brought to him; he\r\nread it with a horror that seems to have shaken his soul. Now the\r\nattention of Government was called to the scandalous work. Government,\r\never responsive to such ill news, appointed a committee of solemn owls\r\nfrom the faculty of Santo Tomas, no less, to study and report upon a\r\nliterary felony so momentous; Government being apparently impressed\r\nwith the notion that a crisis was near and revolution was to be crushed\r\nas usual in the serpent’s egg. For this nothing could be so effective\r\nas the weight of an awe-inspiring authority from the university. No\r\ngreat deliberation was needed to enable the committee to reach its\r\nfindings. In what was plainly intended to be a blasting fire of\r\necclesiastical wrath, book and author were condemned, and Government\r\nwas austerely warned that here was a most insidious and perilous attack\r\nupon all the safeguards of society, upon law and order, civilization,\r\nmonarchy, the supremacy of Spain, business, holy church, and religion\r\nitself. [87]\r\n\r\nLong experimentation with the surviving methods of the Inquisition had\r\nmade the Government expert in these matters. It issued at once a decree\r\nexcluding from the pious Islands a work of such sacrilege and ordered\r\ndiligent search to be made for any copies that might have slipped in to\r\ncorrupt virtue and overthrow the king. Wherever such copies might be\r\nfound they were to be burned by the public executioner. Most rigorous\r\npunishments waited upon the heels of this decree. Any Filipino found\r\nafter a certain date in possession of a copy of “Noli Me Tangere” was\r\nto suffer imprisonment or deportation, with the loss of all his\r\nproperty; this to be confiscated for the benefit of whomsoever should\r\ninform against him. Despite all this valorous resolving and proclaiming\r\nand shaking of the long ears of senile decrepitude, the book continued\r\nto come in and to be circulated. One may suspect that what the\r\nGovernment chiefly effected was gratuitous advertisement. In a short\r\ntime “Noli Me Tangere” became the first topic of conversation\r\nthroughout the educated circles in the islands. The classes whose vices\r\nand villainies were most fiercely attacked in it were its most\r\ndetermined readers. Let the Government do its utmost to annihilate the\r\nbook; in the teeth of decrees, Civil Guards, spies, and inquisitors,\r\nRizal’s purposes were already accomplished. The corrupt, greedy,\r\ntyrannical friar, the plundering, swaggering, brutal Spanish officer,\r\nthe beneficiaries of the System and those consenting to it, saw\r\nthemselves for the first time pilloried in print. [88]\r\n\r\nAbout this process is always something more potent and salutary than\r\ncan be easily explained. It is the elusive, indomitable spirit of that\r\npitiless publicity, at once the armed champion of modern social\r\nprogress, the healer of its diseases, and the corrector of its errors.\r\nSuppose the social malefactor to know full well, as well as he knows\r\nanything, that when he reads in print the story of his misdeeds not one\r\nhundred other persons are likely to see it; he is shaken with ineffable\r\nalarm, nevertheless. The magic of the printed page overwhelms and\r\nconfounds him; in his ear every type-letter is a separate demon yelling\r\n“Scoundrel!” Suppose him to have known theretofore that one hundred\r\nthousand men were saying among themselves this that he now reads in\r\nprint; the knowledge would have disturbed him not to the quiver of an\r\neyelash. But to have it thus in visible record, open to the world’s\r\neye—intolerable! Many a man case-hardened otherwise to conscience or\r\nreproof has fled to suicide before that unwavering finger and\r\nrelentless condemnation.\r\n\r\nThe life of all this is truth. Against printed words that are not true\r\neven the guilty can make a stand, but it is invincible verity that\r\nleaves him naked and trembling. When the first cold shiver had gone by\r\nof the discovery that some one had at last dared to put into print the\r\nhorror of the Philippines, one cry for vengeance went up from the\r\nstripped and shamed exploiters. It was a cry like the angry snarl of\r\nhurt hyenas, ready to tear into pieces whomsoever should fall into\r\ntheir den.\r\n\r\nPresently there came among them the very man of their desire, the\r\nauthor of all this, the object of all their furious hatred;\r\nunsuspectingly he walked into their jungle.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his book Rizal felt free to make the excursion\r\nViola had proposed. They tramped together through remote Germany and\r\nsaw something of Switzerland and of Austria. Rizal, as he went, studied\r\npeasant life, and diligently he compared it with the conditions of the\r\nPhilippine farmers. At the end of the tour, he went to Dresden. There\r\nhe found that by reputation he was already known to Dr. A. B. Meyer and\r\nother scientists, most of whom speedily became his friends. [89]\r\n\r\nFor some weeks the museums of Dresden detained him; now the splendid\r\ncollection of pictures, and now the unusual specimens in the zoölogical\r\nand ethnological museums. Thence he passed to Leitmeritz, old Bohemia,\r\nwhere he began that close and intimate friendship with Dr. Ferdinand\r\nBlumentritt, the famous ethnologist, that was to last so long as Rizal\r\nlived. For months they had been in correspondence; they had even\r\nprogressed in their letters to the stage of a more than ordinary\r\nesteem; for Rizal, as we have seen, having so many other good gifts,\r\nhad also this abundantly, that he could cause his real self to shine\r\nthrough the imperfect medium of the written word and make it appear\r\nwhat it was, a spirit of power and grace. That he might be identified\r\nat the station by his Austrian friend, Rizal sent in advance a\r\npencil-sketch he had made of himself, and with this in hand Dr.\r\nBlumentritt knew him instantly. The high opinion the elder scientist\r\nhad formed of Rizal’s character and talents must have been justified\r\nupon closer acquaintance; it appears that Rizal spent most of his time\r\nat the Blumentritts’, and Mrs. Blumentritt signified her approbation of\r\nhim by cooking for him rare old-time Bohemian dainties, unknown to the\r\nrestaurants and hotels. [90] Thence to Vienna, where he became intimate\r\nwith Nordenfels, the Austrian novelist, and met other men prominent in\r\nliterature and art. Upon all these he seems to have left the uniform\r\nimpress of a mind strong, capacious, and candid, and a soul disciplined\r\nand enlightened.\r\n\r\nHis studies in Vienna completed, he passed into Italy, and in a few\r\nweeks was pondering the antiquities of Rome. Reviewing there his\r\nobservations and researches in so many lands, he concluded that the\r\ntime had come for him to return to the Philippines. The irregularity of\r\nhis passport by which he had escaped from Manila he had since\r\ncorrected; legally, he was as free as any one else to travel in the\r\nIslands. His objective had been won; he had made good use of his time.\r\nHe might even have congratulated himself on the diligence of his\r\nservice. Consecration and an almost prodigious industry had made him\r\none of the foremost scholars of the day; he must now put to use the\r\nresources he had gathered for the chief purpose of aiding his people.\r\nIf we knew more about his disastrous romance we might possibly find\r\nthat Leonora’s silence had become a motive to draw him home. What we do\r\nknow is that he was distressed by the reports he had of his mother’s\r\nfailing eyesight and eager to return to her and help her. For months a\r\ndouble cataract had been growing upon her eyes. He felt sure that he\r\ncould remove it and restore her vision: it was to this branch of\r\noptical surgery that he had given most heed. From Rome he sped to\r\nMarseilles, took steamer on July 3, 1887, for Saigon, and transhipped\r\nfor Manila. On August 5, after five years of wanderings and so many\r\ntriumphs, he saw once more the green tide of the Pasig.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he landed he hastened to his mother at Calamba and, laying\r\naside every other business, devoted himself to the care of her eyes.\r\nWith entire success he performed the operation he had intended, the\r\nfirst of the kind ever done in the Philippines. The fame of Mrs.\r\nMercado’s healing speedily went throughout all the Islands and beyond.\r\nIn the opinion of most persons of that day and region it meant that, by\r\na miracle as of old, sight had been restored to the blind; and, at a\r\nword, Rizal stepped into eminence and a great practice. Of this he was\r\nnot unworthy. As we shall have occasion to see later, he was well aware\r\nof his skill and learning; and, so far as the Orient was concerned, he\r\neclipsed all previous practitioners. Patients came to him with\r\nconfidence from all parts of the Philippines and even from China.\r\n\r\nHe had time to renew some of his old friendships, notably with Fernando\r\nCanon, who had been fellow-student with him in old Spain and later one\r\nof the most effective agents in getting “Noli Me Tangere” into the\r\nIslands, whither he had lately returned. Some of the boxes that\r\ncontained copies of the book had been passed in as Mr. Canon’s stores.\r\nOne day, walking up and down with him at Calamba, Rizal revealed how\r\nnearly the world had come to the loss of this work:\r\n\r\n“I did not believe ‘Noli Me Tangere’ would ever be published. I was in\r\nBerlin, heartbroken with sadness [91] and weakened and discouraged from\r\nhunger and deprivation. I was on the point of throwing my work into the\r\nfire as a thing accursed and fit only to die. And then came the\r\ntelegram from Viola. It revived me; it gave me new hope. I went to the\r\nstation to receive him and spoke to him about my work. He said he might\r\nbe able to help me. I reflected and then decided to shorten the book\r\nand eliminated whole chapters. So he found it much more concise than it\r\nhad been. This accounts for the loose pages of manuscript to which you\r\nhave referred. But these will have a place in the continuation.\r\n\r\n“I will publish seven volumes about Philippine conditions. Then if I do\r\nnot succeed in awakening my countrymen, I will shoot myself.” [92]\r\n\r\nTo his account of this incident Mr. Canon adds:\r\n\r\n“Still there vibrates in my ears the inflections of his voice as he\r\nsaid this. One could recognize Rizal anywhere by the tones of his\r\nvoice.”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his busy employments, there fell upon him, early in\r\n1888, a summons to Manila to appear before Governor-General Terrero.\r\n\r\nThis ominous message was the first repercussion from “Noli Me Tangere”;\r\nthe classes affronted in that book and burning for revenge were moving\r\nto secure it. Here between the claws of their System was the man they\r\nhated; it would go hard if he escaped where so many lesser men had\r\nperished. With what feelings he obeyed the summons he has not told us,\r\nbut there can be hardly a doubt that he knew by whose manœuvers he was\r\nnow in the toils. It is the most singular fact in his whole strange\r\ncareer that he never betrayed the least concern as to what should\r\nbecome of him and throughout whatsoever process might be instituted\r\nagainst him behaved as if it were the trial of another person of which\r\nhe was only the moderately interested witness. It was so now. With\r\nunruffled self-possession he passed before the governor-general.\r\nTerrero told him bluntly of the report of the committee appointed to\r\nexamine “Noli Me Tangere.” Rizal observed that the examination must\r\nhave been faulty, for the book was not what the committee had called it\r\nbut innocent. He made so able a defense that Terrero said finally that\r\nas for himself he had read no more of it than the extracts the\r\ncommittee had cited in its report, but now he should like to read it\r\nall and judge for himself, and asked for a copy of it. This modest\r\nrequest being (despite all fierce decrees) complied with, the\r\ngovernor-general hemmed a little and said he feared that great enmity\r\nhad been aroused against Rizal among the classes he had described. It\r\nwas enmity that might even go so far as to attempt the author’s life.\r\nFor his safety, therefore, it had been deemed wise to assign to him a\r\nbody-guard so long as he should remain in the Islands.\r\n\r\nOf this labored device Rizal might have said that it was but glass, and\r\nthe very sun shone through it. Henceforth every movement he made was to\r\nbe watched and reported, and here was the spy provided by the\r\nGovernment, clumsy-clever, as usual, and forcible-feeble. [93]\r\n\r\nYet even this incident, as things fell out, was to contribute something\r\nto his fame and little joy to his enemies. The body-guard assigned to\r\nhim was a young Spaniard, Lieutenant José de Andrade, born into the\r\ngoverning class and fulfilled with all Spanish prejudices. Although his\r\nassociates were of the type that Rizal had so mercilessly pilloried, so\r\nthat in “Noli Me Tangere” he could hardly fail to recognize portraits\r\nof intimate friends, Lieutenant de Andrade could not more than other\r\nmen withstand the singularly magnetic charm of this unusual\r\npersonality. [94] From his initial status as official spy and\r\nwatch-dog, he became Rizal’s devoted friend. Together they took long\r\nwalking trips into the country, climbed mountains, compared notes and\r\nexperiences, and recited verses. It is to be supposed that the\r\nlieutenant returned the reports he was assigned to make, but reasonably\r\ncertain that they contained no matter that gratified the hatred of the\r\nreactionary element.\r\n\r\nWe have noted what frenzy of consternation seized upon that element at\r\nthe lightest whisper of revolt among the oppressed people. It was one\r\nof the invariable characteristics of the Spanish domination, an\r\nintermittent fever under the empire of which all reason or semblance of\r\nreason went to the winds and men outside the asylums acted like raving\r\nmaniacs. Such manifestations of this strange psychology (only to be\r\nexplained by recalling the Spaniard’s total misunderstanding of the\r\nFilipino nature) as followed the uprising of 1872 were still remembered\r\nby oppressor and oppressed. It was now revived for both as knowledge\r\nspread of this strange and powerful book. Besides the unendurable smart\r\nof its lash, the governing class saw in it consequences of the gravest\r\nimport. It was standing and irrefutable evidence that the contempt for\r\nthe native upon which Spanish rule proceeded was baseless; a native had\r\ncreated literature of the highest order. Still more alarming, it\r\nthreatened to lead the way, to offer the example, to pioneer ceaseless\r\nambuscades of the same kind, to show that the thing superstitiously\r\nheld to be above all attack could be attacked safely and even with\r\nridicule and this deadly laughter. If the author of “Noli Me Tangere”\r\nshould escape without punishment, imitators might be expected on every\r\nside. Any native anywhere might take up similar weapons; hence, the\r\nwhite man’s supremacy in all the East was in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for the Occidental mind to grasp the power this\r\nsuggestion has upon men charged with the holding in subjection of vast\r\nAsiatic populations; but it is to such men always the first\r\nconsideration. It must be, in fact; because their situation is so\r\nabnormal that in times of cool reflection they must wonder at\r\nthemselves. With bands of soldiers insignificant in numbers they are\r\nrequired to impose upon millions a sovereignty that the millions\r\ngenerally loathe. Diligently, then, they must support the fiction of\r\nthe white man’s superiority, support it day and night without ceasing\r\nand be not too finical about means or manner. Doubtless, to many the\r\ntask soon becomes congenial, so easily is race hatred bred in places\r\nout of the observation of Europe, and so strong is the addiction to it\r\nin some hearts not yet well removed from the stone age. Yet there have\r\noften appeared in these grimy scenes Europeans that instinctively hated\r\nthe business and knew well enough that at bottom the real reason for\r\ndominating these subject peoples was dirty profits dirtily obtained.\r\n[95] But these very men, again and again, by the clamors about them and\r\nby the panic nature of the fears of what the aroused brown millions\r\nmight do, have been swept despite themselves into acts at which their\r\nbetter natures revolted.\r\n\r\nGovernor-General Terrero was of this order, and even above its average.\r\nHe was willing at the instigation of angry friars to assign a spy to\r\nwatch Rizal but was determined to avoid the silly and stupid crime of\r\nshooting or garroting or even exiling a man whose offense was that he\r\nhad written a novel some persons did not like. In other days and other\r\nadministrations men had been shot or garroted or exiled on charges as\r\nflimsy, but light was breaking in Spain; even in the face of tradition\r\nand old frowning privilege, light was breaking. The first rift in the\r\nmedieval eclipse was driven by the sword of Napoleon. Slowly ever since\r\nit has been widening to echoes of the world’s advance elsewhere. In\r\n1888 the governing class in Spain had become aware of the scorn of that\r\nworld and began to feel a little the sting of it. Not much, then, nor\r\nsince, as we are to see in this narrative, and might illustrate by\r\nother citations. Lo, it was this same Spain, and so late as 1909, that\r\nmurdered Francisco Ferrer, the most learned man in her dominions, for\r\nbut teaching her children in the manner of other nations—nations so far\r\nin the front of her that, looking back, they could scarce descry the\r\ndust of her sluggard footsteps!\r\n\r\nTerrero, at least, was not indifferent to the verdict of enlightened\r\nmankind; yet the pressure upon him to take some action against this\r\natrocious leveler and dangerous character was greater than he could\r\nwithstand. It came from the power that made or broke governor-generals,\r\nthe power of the orders, supreme in the Islands, supreme in Spain on\r\nany matter that related to the Islands. By the beginning of 1888 their\r\ndemand had reached a point where he must compromise with it, and he\r\n“advised” Rizal to leave the Philippines at once. The word is equivocal\r\nand was meant so to be; the real significance of “advice” in this\r\ninstance was an unofficial order of deportation. [96]\r\n\r\nRizal obeyed, but not until he had given to the world new evidence of\r\nthe versatility of a genius to which there is scarcely a companion in\r\nhuman records. We are to remember, first of all, he was a physician\r\nthat had chosen diseases of the eye for his specialty, wherein he stood\r\nin a place of distinction before his profession. He was next an artist\r\nin sculpture and painting; a poet; a master of terse and nervous prose\r\nin Spanish, in his native Tagalog, and in ten other languages. He was\r\nnext a scientist, distinguished in original research, already honored\r\nwith the regard of leading European minds in many branches of recondite\r\nknowledge. This, it will be admitted, is a most unusual range of\r\npursuits. From them economics might be regarded as far removed and\r\nnegligible. Yet he now showed that his many-sided mind could enlist its\r\nenergies in even the “dismal science” and his skill in expression could\r\nilluminate it.\r\n\r\nTaxes in the Philippines had always been haphazard. They were levied\r\nwithout system or anything akin to system. Only one feature about them\r\ncould be said to be uniform: everywhere the wealthy evaded their just\r\nshare of the taxation burden; everywhere the poor bore more than was\r\nright for them to bear. The history of Spanish rule was a succession of\r\npromises of reform, usually wrenched by an insurrection from the\r\nunwilling lips of a governor-general and ignored when the time of\r\ndanger had passed. In the year of grace 1888 came such a reformatory\r\nspasm about taxes. When it reached Calamba it was received with\r\nexceptional interest for the reason that the Dominicans, with whom the\r\nhouseholders had an ancient feud, owned a great deal of property there\r\nand on it paid very little.\r\n\r\nThis, though outside of Rizal’s studies, was a subject all within the\r\npurpose to which he had consecrated himself. He was to live for his\r\npeople; he was to do whatever came to his hand to help them to rise.\r\nHere was a poignant illustration of the vast and complicated evils that\r\nweighed them down. Since his first interview with Terrero he had been\r\nliving at Calamba in his mother’s house, practising with brilliant\r\nsuccess his profession and lending his influence to every project that\r\nseemed to promise good for the Filipinos. His prestige and influence\r\nhad become great. Despite all the efforts of the Government, knowledge\r\nof his book and of its meaning was wide-spread. Copies were continually\r\nbeing smuggled into the country and passed from hand to hand. Often at\r\nthe approach of officers they were buried in fields or rubbish-heaps\r\nand dug up again when the danger was gone. A Filipino that could read\r\nwas a popular man, then, in his community; he found much employment\r\nreading “Noli Me Tangere” to groups that cowered in the brush, maybe, a\r\nsentinel posted to give warning of the approach of the Civil Guard. The\r\nresult of all this could be but one thing. From the mass of the\r\ndespised Filipinos he was emerging as their natural leader.\r\n\r\nHe observed now the approach of the taxation issue and, one might say,\r\nwent forth to meet it. His facile and powerful mind absorbed the whole\r\nbusiness. Taxation he studied until he seemed to know more about it\r\nthan any other man in the Islands. In the manner of the true modern\r\ninvestigator, he sought for facts, not arguments: what the poor man\r\npaid upon his small holding, what the rich owner paid upon his great\r\nestate. When these had been gathered, he reduced them all to a report\r\nthat the overburdened taxpayers took for their own and presented to the\r\nGovernment impressively signed by their local officers. [97]\r\n\r\nHe had done more here, very likely, than he himself knew. The document\r\nthus prepared became the rallying-point for another of those struggles\r\nbetween the people and the Government that increasingly signaled the\r\ndownfall of the existing System. Slowly the nineteenth century was\r\nclosing in upon the sixteenth, democracy upon the autocracy that at the\r\nborders of civilization still outlived the date of its normal demise.\r\nRizal’s work on taxation showed the Filipinos what they could do by\r\nuniting their efforts. In their country, too, the exploiter held the\r\nexploited by fomenting among them envyings, jealousies, and caste; a\r\nprocess that everywhere attends (and usually comprises) the white man’s\r\nburden, and whereof India offers the chief surviving example. In the\r\nface of every obstacle and discouragement the Filipinos were now\r\nlearning the lesson of union, and the only shadow union cast forward\r\nwas revolt.\r\n\r\nRizal’s leadership was a phrase we used in a foregoing paragraph. It is\r\nto be noted that he came into that eminence without an effort of his\r\nown, without planning or connivance. He was elated to find greatness\r\nthus thrust upon him and would not have been human otherwise; yet to be\r\nconspicuous had never been any real part of his scheme of life, and\r\nwhen elation was at its height it never obscured the fact that what he\r\nreally sought was a result for the country and not kudos for himself.\r\nBut he was the most famous of living Filipinos; knowledge of his place\r\namong the world’s scientists was now general among his countrymen;\r\nthose that had not been able to read “Noli Me Tangere” nor to hear it\r\nread were becoming aware by common report of the nature of its protest.\r\nHe was the one man that had been able to make the bitter cry of the\r\nFilipinos audible to the world. He had best formulated and expressed\r\nthe wrongs under which those people suffered. He alone, with this\r\nfierce derision, had dared to defy the power of the friars and the\r\nbrutal fists of the Civil Guards. Naturally, the people turned to him,\r\nand the unanimity with which they sought his counsel might have shown\r\nthe Spaniards again among what fires they were walking; for the spirit\r\nthat gave rise to the popularity of Rizal was even more significant\r\nthan anything he said in his book. Before that book was written the\r\nspirit had been there; it was growing while the friars debated the best\r\nmeans to suppress the audacious author; it was certain to break out\r\ninto open revolt—if not under Rizal, then under some one else.\r\n\r\nIn view of these conditions, Rizal has been subjected to some criticism\r\nfor obeying the sugar-coated deportation-order of the governor-general\r\nand taking himself from the Islands at a time so momentous. The\r\ncriticism is not now important but, to keep straight the thread of\r\nnarrative, may be examined here. To say nothing of the obvious fact\r\nthat, as the power of the governor-general was absolute, hesitation to\r\nobey would be followed by an explicit command, other things were to be\r\nconsidered. All Rizal’s instincts strove against the idea of advance by\r\nphysical violence. He believed in the weapons of the spirit, not in the\r\ncarnal sword. To defy the governor-general’s “advice” meant but one\r\nthing. It would be a direct appeal to physical force; it would be\r\nfollowed by revolution and slaughter; and to these he felt he could\r\nnever consent.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he was up to this time not in favor of immediate separation\r\nfrom Spain. On this issue his views have been distorted by\r\ncontroversialists that have selected expressions seemingly favorable to\r\none side or the other of a disputed question. Long after events had\r\nwholly changed the face and the substance of Philippine affairs it was\r\nthe custom of persons opposed to Philippine independence to cite Rizal\r\nin support of their arguments. This was unfairly done. Reference to one\r\nundeniable fact should be enough to dispose of the fabricated\r\nuncertainty about his views on this question. All the reforms he strove\r\nfor looked to independence and could not look to anything else. It was\r\nnot for academic satisfaction he desired increase of culture among his\r\npeople, but that with wisdom and confidence they might take their place\r\namong the nations of earth. It was not for the mere sake of teaching\r\nthat he desired to see them taught, but that they might be taught to be\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nWhen we recognize this basis, which shows plainly enough in his\r\nwritings, [98] his attitude toward Spain, otherwise mysterious or\r\ncontradictory, is consistent enough to suit any taste. He wished Spain\r\nto grant reforms, to adopt a system of education that would meet some,\r\nat least, of the urgent needs of the people, to unchain the press, to\r\nremake the grotesque courts, to recognize the people of the Islands as\r\nhuman beings, and to give them something to live for. The effect of\r\nthese changes, he well knew, would be to release the Filipino mind, and\r\nwhen that should be set free the result could be only one thing. It was\r\ndarkness and ignorance that enabled Spain to rule; the symbols of all\r\nher power were of the night. But he thought the reforms that would\r\nallow the Filipino to stand upright before the world Spain itself must\r\ngrant; to try to wrest them from her, gun in hand, would be to miss\r\nthem altogether. Spain must grant them. True, she would thereby be\r\nlighting her own eventual exit from the Islands, but he was able to\r\nmake himself believe (for a time) that the Spanish Government could be\r\npersuaded, or led by events, to do this thing. This was a lovely dream\r\nand possible only to one of faith larger than the average man’s in the\r\ninnate strength of a cause just and reasonable. It was not really in\r\nhim inconsistent that all this time he was under no illusion about the\r\nbespattered record and reactionary tendencies of the controlling power\r\nin Spain; what he thought, apparently, was that by bringing home to\r\nthat power a sense of the world’s contempt and urging the need of\r\nsweeping reforms such agitation would generate its own compulsive and\r\nundeniable force. He is not the only man in history in whom the sense\r\nof justice was so strong it obscured its total want in others.\r\n\r\nBut even so, in a way, what confronted him and the Philippines at the\r\nmoment was beyond choosing. The immediate demand must be for the\r\nreforms that lay in Spain’s power to give or to withhold; these were\r\nimperative; that a start may be made upon the road, let us unite and\r\ndemand these first reforms.\r\n\r\nThere can be no manner of doubt that these were the ideas that\r\ncontrolled him when Terrero “advised” him to depart, and none that in\r\nthe next few years his views on these subjects contracted as he looked\r\nmore searchingly upon the troglodyte methods of the Spanish rulers. He\r\nwas the less reluctant to leave the Philippines because his private\r\nlife, apart from his career of service, had been darkened by the\r\ncatastrophe of his love-affair; he had come home to find Leonora\r\nmarried. Two other impulses concurred to urge him away. The success of\r\n“Noli Me Tangere” (despite so many and powerful measures taken to\r\nsuppress the book) and the manifest effect of it upon the Filipino mind\r\nmust have strongly reminded him of that sequel he had vaguely intended\r\nwhen he completed the last chapters of his novel. He could not hope to\r\naccomplish any such work at home; he could not hope, even if he should\r\nwrite it there, to find a publisher for it in the Islands nor to\r\nsmuggle out the manuscript. To write it he must be abroad. Next, he had\r\nseen much of Europe but nothing of that American Republic about which\r\nJagor’s prophecy had so inflamed his youthful mind. Here, by Jagor’s\r\nlogic, was the power destined some day to transform all the regions\r\nbordering upon the Pacific, and he had never seen it. This was also the\r\ncountry whose history and spirit he had glimpsed in the “Lives of the\r\nPresidents” that he so eagerly read and returned to. In that country\r\nfarmers’ boys, canal-boat drivers, tailors’ apprentices,\r\nrail-splitters, journeyman printers, any son of the plain people could\r\nrise to any place, even the highest. It was a country that\r\nconspicuously had won to freedom and independence out of a gross\r\ntyranny. Therefore, it had a peculiar claim to his attention. As he\r\nmust go somewhere, he planned to return to Europe by way of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nHe was relieved of all anxiety about his mother. The eyesight of her\r\nyouth had been restored to her.\r\n\r\nThis time there was no difficulty about his passport and no need that\r\nhe should, like an escaping criminal, steal at night from the city. The\r\nresponsible powers were but too glad to have him go. He sailed from\r\nManila on February 28, 1888, going first to Hong-Kong. There and in the\r\nneighboring city of Macao he visited and talked with many refugees and\r\nexiles of 1872, annus hystericus in Philippine history. By deportation\r\nor flight that year the islands had lost hundreds of their best minds\r\nand ablest servitors. That many of these were afterward proved to have\r\nhad nothing to do with the uprising for which they were banished or\r\nhunted is superfluous evidence of the mad psychology of the time. In\r\nmost of these cases there were no trials, no investigations, no\r\nqueries. Some one frenzied with fear imagined the man across the street\r\nto be behaving in a way that indicated conspiracy; to the Ladrones with\r\nhim! Some one else saw two men in the street salute each other with\r\nsuspicious gravity; the next morning both were on their way to the\r\nCarolines. [99] The Herrara family had maintained a back yard quarrel\r\nwith the Venturas. Mr. Ventura was denounced and spent the rest of his\r\nlife in loneliness at Macao. It was the Lion’s Mouth and the cachets of\r\nthe Bastile, revived for the astonished instruction of the age of\r\nsteam. Cases are in the records of men that were seen carrying home\r\nbundles—fish, maybe, or steak. “Bombs!” cried the officers, under the\r\nsway of emotion, and that night haled the unfortunate householder from\r\nhis bed. Sometimes the intended victims of these maniacal\r\nmanifestations received friendly hints before the blow fell and had\r\ntime to flee to the woods, whence they made their way out of the\r\ncountry, to live, very likely, in the utmost poverty.\r\n\r\nSuch was the lot, in fact, of most of the men deported. One of them, a\r\nlearned lawyer, the ornament of the Philippine bar, as innocent of the\r\nconspiracy as the premier of Spain himself, was twenty years later\r\npicking up the crumbs of a living by trying to practise a little\r\nSpanish law in London. [100]\r\n\r\nIt is to be assumed that conversation with such men did nothing to\r\nsoften Rizal’s spirit or to cool his ardor of service. They were the\r\nliving monuments to the hopeless incapacity of the existing System to\r\ngovern or to advance. From his days and nights in their company he\r\npassed to Japan, where in the space of one month he achieved the almost\r\nincredible feat of mastering the Japanese language. But for the\r\ntestimony of the facts the hardiest biographer would scarce dare the\r\nassertion. Rizal came to Japan with scarce a word of Japanese; he\r\nremained but one month; before he departed he was speaking it so well\r\nthat the natives thought he was a countryman of theirs, and he was\r\nacting as their interpreter. Thereafter he could speak and write\r\nJapanese as readily as English or German.\r\n\r\nAt Hong-Kong he had been somewhat surprised to find himself invited to\r\nthe Spanish consulate and urged to abide there. [101] At Tokio this\r\nexperience was repeated, the Spanish legation offering him its\r\nhospitality and even suggesting employment as a translator. The\r\npurposes of these advances were clear enough. He was one that the\r\nGovernment willed, after its custom, to have always under surveillance;\r\nto have him beneath a legation roof was easier and cheaper than to hire\r\nsecret service men.\r\n\r\nFrom Yokohama he sailed for San Francisco, astonishing his\r\nfellow-travelers by conversing with all the aliens in their own\r\ntongues, whatever these might be. Among them was a Japanese that knew\r\nnot a word of English. Rizal attached himself to this unfortunate and\r\nacted as his interpreter all the way to London.\r\n\r\nWhen he landed at San Francisco, April 28, 1888, his first experiences\r\nunder the American flag were hardly calculated to swell his enthusiasm\r\nfor the republic. It happened to be a time when a terror of epidemics\r\nwas afoot, and he might have reminded himself from what he saw that\r\nsporadic hysteria is not the exclusive possession of the Spaniards nor\r\nof anybody else. What a whisper of insurrection meant to a Spanish\r\ngovernment officer in Manila, a vision of a cholera-germ might signify\r\nto a health-officer in America. The health authorities of San Francisco\r\nwere then busily quarantining everything that came into the port. To\r\nthem the fact that Rizal’s steamer carried a clean bill of health meant\r\nnothing, nor that she had been properly inspected and cleared at\r\nYokohama, nor that no disease had developed among her people on the way\r\nover. Who knew what horrent microbes might be lurking in her woodwork\r\nor snugging in the coal-hole? Therefore, authority decreed to hold her\r\nday after day in quarantine while the passengers chafed and fidgeted\r\nand the British among them complained to their consul and threatened an\r\ninternational scandal. [102]\r\n\r\nRizal seems to have endured the affliction with his customary\r\nphilosophy. From the deck he made sketches of the new country that thus\r\nslammed its doors in his face—among them a reproduction of the revenue\r\nflag, with its eagle and perpendicular bars, which he thought was a\r\nnovel and taking design. He did not fail to observe, however, that\r\nwhile the human beings on the steamer were rigidly quarantined the\r\ncargo was unloaded, and he wondered how infection could be carried by\r\nthe passengers and not by the freight. When he was released, he went to\r\nthe old Palace Hotel in San Francisco and spent several days observing\r\nthe strange life of the city. Thence, by train over the mountains,\r\nnoting with astonishment how great an area of the country through which\r\nhe passed was uninhabited, and apparently being rather entertained than\r\nenraged by the horrors of the American sleeping-car. Two things of much\r\ngreater moment impressed him sadly. One was the race prejudice against\r\nthe Chinese in San Francisco (then at its height), and the other the\r\nrace prejudice against the Negro, manifested in some other parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAfterward he wrote this summary of his swallow flight across the\r\ncontinent:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I visited the larger cities of America. They have splendid\r\n    buildings and magnificent ideals. America is a home-land for the\r\n    poor that are willing to work. I traveled across America, and saw\r\n    the majestic cascade of Niagara. I was in New York, the great city,\r\n    but there everything is new. I went to see some relics of\r\n    Washington, that great man who, I fear, has not his equal in this\r\n    century.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Albany he had gone forward by the Hudson River, and was greatly\r\nimpressed with its magnificent scenery, but thought that, in the way of\r\ncommerce alone, the Pasig was busier. From New York he sailed on the\r\nsteamer City of Rome, then esteemed a maritime masterpiece, and reached\r\nLondon, where he found lodgings with the organist of St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral and settled himself for a season of work and study.\r\n\r\nPart of this work became afterward an invaluable legacy to his\r\ncountrymen and literature. In his youth he had heard of a wonderful\r\nbook, of which only two or three copies existed in all the world, a\r\nbook written in 1607 [103] about the Philippine Islands and their\r\npeople as they were then. A blunt, honest old Spaniard, Antonio de\r\nMorga, had written it, apparently with no purpose except to tell the\r\ntruth, an impulse that in itself for his times was enough to confer\r\ndistinction. Other Spanish writers of that day had written to create\r\ndesired impressions, to justify theories or to excuse the Spanish\r\naggression, whereby the lies had dripped like oil from their pens. De\r\nMorga had as good a chance as anybody else to know the Islands; he had\r\naccompanied one of the earliest of the Spanish expeditions and for\r\nseven years had been a part of its exploits. One of the few copies of\r\nhis book, “Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas,” was in the British Museum.\r\nRizal formed the ambitious design to rescue it from oblivion and\r\nrepublish it, annotated and clarified.\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty he ran the barrage so strangely erected around\r\nthis institution and found the precious volume to be all that had been\r\nsaid in praise of it. De Morga’s observations, evidently unbiased,\r\nestablished what Rizal had long surmised and then asserted, that the\r\nFilipinos had been historically wronged. The sea-coast folk, at least,\r\nthe bulk of the nation, had not been more truly savages when Magellan\r\ncame than the Spaniards themselves. From de Morga’s accounts it was\r\neasy to show that the Filipino’s spirit, activities, and general\r\nwelfare had been in no way bettered by Spanish rule. Arts, industries,\r\nproducts in the Islands, and even energy, seemed to have been more\r\nobservable among the people in de Morga’s day than at the close of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis was a matter of grave importance to the Islanders and so remained\r\nlong after Rizal’s labors had ceased. The Spanish excused to the world\r\ntheir presence and their cruelties alike on the one ground that the\r\nIndio was a savage. Suppose him without European restraint and European\r\ninspiration, they said; he would revert to his caves, his raw meat, and\r\nhis bows and arrows. To learn that he was heir to these centuries of\r\ndignity and worth was not only disconcerting but raised a question to\r\nwhich there was no answer. If he was as civilized as the Spaniard, why\r\nhad he not the Spaniard’s right to be free?\r\n\r\nDe Morga described at length the arts and industries that flourished in\r\nthe Philippines long before a Spanish flag had fluttered above their\r\nwaters; the excellence in weaving, in metalwork, agriculture,\r\ngovernment, domestic arts, commerce, navigation; how the natives lived\r\nand worked, what good ships they built, what busy marts they had\r\nerected. [104] On this Rizal’s observations are shrewd and witty, but\r\nhe sometimes allowed his joy over the vindication of his people and of\r\nhis own theories about them to sweep him out of that coolly scientific\r\nattitude he usually maintained about such things. For this he may be\r\nforgiven. He was sensitive, he was proud; he had suffered for the\r\nunjust disparagement of his race; he was dealing with evidence that the\r\nFilipino stock was as good as any other, as much entitled to\r\ndevelopment in its own way.\r\n\r\nWhile he was making these studies he found relaxation in athletics. He\r\nscrewed together some of his regularly apportioned time to get into the\r\nfields and play. He learned to box and to play cricket; he had long\r\nbeen an expert fencer. [105] At cricket he was so good that it seems a\r\npity baseball came so late into his country; it is a game that would\r\nhave exactly suited his tastes and inclinings. In the combination of\r\nalert mentality and swift physical action that baseball requires must\r\nbe something peculiarly attractive to the Filipino, for do but observe\r\nthe astonishing records he has made at it, exciting the admiration of\r\nthe most experienced judges. Rizal had never forgotten the training in\r\nphysical exercise he had received from his uncle; he still loved to\r\nfence, to ride, to run, to take long, swift walks. His faith was all in\r\nthe mental health that is fortified by physical well-being; when all\r\nhis mental enginery had been working full tilt he found ease in the\r\nopen air, in quick motion and the trees and flowers. His body was as\r\nsupple as a wrestler’s, and in support of his theories of reciprocal\r\nmental and physical soundness it is to be remarked that in all his life\r\nhe seems never to have been seriously ill.\r\n\r\nIn London he found congenial company in the household of Dr. Antonio\r\nRegidor, a Filipino that had suffered exile in the Cavite frenzy of\r\n1872. Dr. Regidor had three charming daughters. Rizal’s ideas of life\r\nand conduct may be gathered from the fact that when, after a time, he\r\ndiscovered that one of these young ladies was forming an attachment for\r\nhim, instead of being elated he was much troubled in his mind and\r\nconcluded that in such circumstances the best thing he could do was to\r\ntake himself out of the young lady’s sight. For once the paths of duty\r\nand expediency fell together. By this time he had completed his work at\r\nthe museum and he now departed for Paris.\r\n\r\nThere, Juan Luna, [106] the Filipino painter, with whom Rizal had\r\nformed a close friendship while both were in Madrid, 1882 to 1885, had\r\nnow made his home and Rizal seems to have rejoiced to renew his\r\nassociations with his talented countryman. It is certain that the\r\nstupidity of race prejudice, which has so many other and blacker wrongs\r\nto answer for, has deprived this man of a certain part of his just\r\nreward. Yet he was a great painter, the winner of prizes in many\r\nEuropean competitions, and an artist that Paris delighted to honor.\r\n[107] A contemporary and fellow Filipino, Hidalgo, was hardly less\r\nsuccessful; so seldom are their achievements counted in any summary of\r\nthe Malay that most unjustly America is still unaware of them. Rizal\r\nusually spent his Sundays in Luna’s studio, sometimes fencing,\r\nsometimes talking art, of which he was still, for all his troubles,\r\ndistractions, and complex activities, the steadfast worshiper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE GRAPES OF WRATH\r\n\r\n\r\nThough all this time out of the sight of his enemies in Manila, he\r\nseems never to have been out of their minds; authoritative evidence\r\nthat in his novel he had told the truth about them. Theirs was a hatred\r\nnot unmixed with reasonable fears of his popularity and of his powerful\r\npen. They waited until he was at a safe distance before they moved\r\nagainst him, and then in a way that verified the ancient adage\r\nconcerning the union of the essential qualities of bully and coward.\r\nThey struck at him through his family, left now without defense.\r\n\r\nHis sister Lucia was married to Mariano Herbosa, who in Manila had been\r\nRizal’s dear friend. Herbosa died soon after Rizal’s departure, and his\r\ndeath gave to the friars an opportunity for a revenge as uncouth and\r\nrevolting as far-fetched. On the ground that Herbosa had not received\r\nfinal absolution before his death, they ordered his body to be dug up\r\nand cast out of the church where it had been buried. [108] To the\r\nfamily of a sincere Catholic this involved an almost insupportable\r\ngrief, an almost maddening wrong. That they might give to their action\r\nthe semblance of legality the friars had telegraphed the archbishop at\r\nManila that Rizal’s brother-in-law had died after neglecting his church\r\nduties and abandoning the confessional. [109] Then they hypocritically\r\nasked what they should do in the case, knowing full well that on such a\r\npresentation only one response was possible. Protests and appeals by\r\nthe family won no mitigation of the harsh sentence; they are said to\r\nhave been stifled or diverted on the way, so that the archbishop never\r\nsaw them; and the wife and children must bear the taunts their\r\nimpotence invited as well as the indignity to the memory of husband and\r\nfather. It appears that the charges against Herbosa were mere\r\ninventions; he had with fidelity performed all his religious duties.\r\n\r\nNo one connected even remotely or nominally with the bold delineator of\r\nfriar government was safe; through the persecution of his relatives he\r\nhimself could be made to suffer. His brother Paciano was now banished\r\nto Mindoro on some blown-up charge of thinking sedition. The pretext\r\nwas nothing; anything would serve, from barratry to simony. Another\r\nbrother-in-law was still available, Manuel Hidalgo by name. Him the\r\nauthorities caught on a charge of sacrilege. A child of his had died of\r\ncholera, and he had buried it without the ceremonies of the church. The\r\ncivil law prescribed in cholera cases immediate burial, and the\r\nhealth-officers demanded it. A poor man in such an emergency might well\r\nhave been distracted between conflicting decrees of church and state.\r\nIt seems that in other such cases when the head of the family obeyed\r\nthe civil precepts he heard nothing of sacrilege. But they were not\r\nbrothers-in-law of Rizal. Pounce, came the church upon the wretched\r\noffender. The next thing he knew he was deported. [110]\r\n\r\nNext two of Rizal’s sisters fell into the same net. Sedition and\r\nsacrilege were handy offenses. They could be preferred against anybody\r\nfor anything.\r\n\r\nHis father was the next victim. In his case the plain purpose was ruin,\r\nto be achieved by means suggested to ill minds through an out-cropping\r\nof one man’s childish malice. Mr. Mercado raised prize turkeys. The\r\nintendant, or manager, of the Dominican estate, which claimed ownership\r\nin all the land in the region of the Mercado homestead, had a nice\r\ntaste in these birds when skilfully cooked, and it was his pleasing\r\nhabit to demand from time to time gifts of the choicest of the Mercado\r\nturkeys to adorn his own table. The time came when it was no longer\r\npossible thus to propitiate the petty tyrant; disease had carried off\r\nthe firstlings of the flock, and what were left were absolutely needed\r\nto replenish the breed.\r\n\r\nFrom homely incidents like these we see the Philippines as they were\r\nand illuminate again the unforgettable pages of Rizal’s stories. The\r\nintendant made no secret of his purpose to revenge himself; they had at\r\nleast the virtue of candor, these little satraps. He conceived that his\r\nimmortal dignity had suffered because he had been refused turkeys when\r\nthere were no turkeys, and nothing would ease the sting of that burning\r\nwrong but retribution. When the next rent-day came, Mr. Mercado found\r\nthat his rent had been doubled. He paid the increase and made no\r\ncomplaint. The next rent-day he found that again the rate had been\r\ndoubled. This likewise he paid without protest. When the next rent-day\r\ncame and he found the rate was again increased he made the fatal\r\nblunder of appealing to the courts. [111]\r\n\r\nAggrieved members of the governing class must have joyed to learn of so\r\nexcellent an opportunity to salve their hurts, also, in this medicament\r\nof revenge. Here was the father of the hated José Rizal delivered into\r\ntheir hands. They took the case from the justice of the peace at\r\nCalamba, in whose jurisdiction it rightfully belonged, and sent it\r\nbefore a judge whose decision they must have felt sure they could\r\ncontrol. There had now become involved in the case a question of\r\nbroader moment. Mr. Mercado’s sturdy resistance had heartened the other\r\ntenants to revive the ancient and unsettled issue of the title to the\r\nlands. For many years careful men had held that the Dominicans, who\r\nassumed to own all this region and to collect all rents from it, had no\r\nright to any of it. The select judge before whom came these questions\r\nlost no time in deciding them against Mercado and the other tenants.\r\nMercado appealed, and thereby precipitated one of the strangest\r\nincidents of the story.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden appeared at Calamba a battery of artillery and a company of\r\nsoldiers, who ostentatiously took possession of the town as if it had\r\nbeen in a state of armed revolt. At this the inhabitants blinked and\r\ngasped, for nowhere on earth lay a more peaceable community. They were\r\nnot left long in doubt as to what was toward. The commandant of the\r\ntroops issued a curt order to Mercado and the other tenants involved in\r\nthe litigation to remove within twenty-four hours all their buildings\r\nfrom the land they had occupied. An appeal was pending, a fact that in\r\nall civilized countries would have been sufficient to stay proceedings\r\nuntil the appeal could be decided. It was of no such validity here. To\r\ncomply with the savage order was physically impossible; there were not\r\nhands enough in Calamba nor in all the country around. At the end of\r\nthe next day the agents of the authorities set fire to all the houses,\r\nand among them perished from human sight and treasuring the house where\r\nJosé Rizal was born. [112]\r\n\r\nAcross this repulsive story glowers a face permanently evil in history.\r\nThe governor-general that connived at these barbarities where he did\r\nnot order them was Emiliano Weyler, immortal in the records of Cuba as\r\n“The Butcher,” accused of deeds there so horrible they can never be put\r\ninto print, accused in the Philippines of huge peculations as well as\r\nstupid cruelties, a man that seemed to delight in cruelty as other men\r\ndelight in kindness. It was he that thought, “in the gloomy recesses of\r\na mind capacious of such things,” of the expedient of overawing Calamba\r\nand the courts with artillery and martial law upon the heads of the\r\nlitigants; it was he that had made the most show of a violent hatred of\r\nRizal and furnished the proof that the persecution of Francisco Mercado\r\nwas revenge upon Francisco Mercado’s son. When Weyler transferred his\r\nrule of blood and iron to Cuba, he left in the official archives\r\nevidence of the real nature of the proceedings. He can have had no\r\nsuspicion that he was preparing evidence of his own iniquity to be\r\ngiven to the world through the nation he most hated. His papers were\r\nstill in the archives August 13, 1898, when Manila surrendered to Dewey\r\nand Merritt. Among them was a copy of a letter he had sent at this time\r\nto certain of the friar landlords, expressing his full sympathy with\r\nthem and (with a characteristic touch) the pleasure he had in serving\r\nthem against the tenantry. [113]\r\n\r\nIn the spot from which it had been thus evicted the Mercado family had\r\nlived for many years. There could have come upon these kinsfolk of\r\nRizal no sterner test of their fortitude. Before it they went their way\r\nundaunted. At Los Baños was a small house to which Mr. Mercado had\r\ntitle. There he led his family to a refuge and continued his fight\r\nagainst the friars.\r\n\r\nRizal was in London when the news reached him of the petty vengeance\r\nwreaked upon the body of his brother-in-law. There had been launched\r\nsome months before by the Filipino colony in Madrid a semimonthly\r\nmagazine called “La Solidaridad,” the object of which was to arouse and\r\nunify the Filipinos and wrest reforms from the Spanish Government. With\r\nimpunity it could be published in Madrid but could not have lived a day\r\nin Manila, a fact sufficiently indicating the power and value of\r\npublicity. Spain, with the eyes of Europe upon her, did not dare to do\r\nat home the things she did daily in the Philippines; dared not to do\r\nthem or dared not to avow them. Distance, creating an impenetrable\r\nscreen, created also in effect a transition from the modern to the\r\nantique world. There was much freedom of the press in Spain, a freedom,\r\nas we have remarked, partly sustained by the incessant threat of\r\nrebellion in Barcelona. Therefore, as a singular fact and almost\r\ncomically incongruous, “La Solidaridad,” [114] with its acrid criticism\r\nof the Spanish Government, circulated freely in Spain and was not\r\nallowed to enter the Philippines. One of its editors was Marcelo H. del\r\nPilar, a resolute and restless man, type of the intransigent, the\r\nindomitable and professional revolutionist. Before long he and Rizal\r\nquarreled, [115] for he was all for revolution by physical force and\r\nRizal was always asserting its futility. A few years later del Pilar\r\ndied on his way home to start his long meditated uprising. Untimely was\r\nhis death if any man’s ever was. He would have reached the Philippines\r\nto find in full swing a revolution wherein his tireless energies and\r\nfiery spirit would have found an outlet at which men might have\r\nwondered.\r\n\r\nBut before they quarreled Rizal had written much for del Pilar and “La\r\nSolidaridad;” poems, articles, editorials, all directed toward\r\nPhilippine reforms. When he heard of the indignity put for his sake\r\nupon the name and clay of Herbosa, he took up his pen and poured out\r\nfor his journal an account of the incident and his feelings about it\r\nthat scalded the church authorities with a flood of the short, hot\r\nsentences he knew so well how to write—scoriæ and hot lava from the\r\nvolcano. When the news of the attack upon his father came he was living\r\nin Ghent, whither he had retired to write his new novel “El\r\nFilibusterismo.” The effect upon him of the persecution of his family\r\nis to be observed in the work he was doing at the time; in one place he\r\nmakes direct reference to it. He has been telling the story of Cabesang\r\nTales, a peaceful Filipino farmer, driven to brigandage by the\r\nextortions of the friars and the savageries of the Civil Guards. Then\r\nhe says, with mingled rage and sarcasm:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Calm yourselves, peaceful inhabitants of Calamba! None of you is\r\n    named Tales, none of you has committed any crime.... You cleared\r\n    your fields, on them you have spent the labor of your whole lives,\r\n    your savings, your vigils and privations, and you have been\r\n    despoiled of them, driven from your homes, with the rest forbidden\r\n    to show you hospitality! Not content with outraging justice, they\r\n    have trampled upon the sacred altars of your country! You have\r\n    served Spain and the king, and when in their name you have asked\r\n    for justice you were banished without trial, torn from your wives’\r\n    arms and your children’s caresses! Any one of you has suffered more\r\n    than Cabesang Tales, and yet not one of you has received justice.\r\n    Neither pity nor humanity has been shown to you—you have been\r\n    persecuted even beyond the tomb, as was Mariano Herbosa. Weep, or\r\n    laugh, there in those lonely isles, where you wander vaguely,\r\n    uncertain of the future! Spain, the generous Spain, is watching\r\n    over you and soon or late, you will have justice! [116]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the bitter sarcasm of a soul stung beyond endurance with the\r\nsense of great wrong.\r\n\r\nAs a work of fictional art, “El Filibusterismo” is not equal to “Noli\r\nMe Tangere.” It is likely that Rizal knew this and as likely that he\r\ncared not, having now another purpose than to tell a story powerfully.\r\nHe is working with rather less of a connected story and rather less of\r\nthe clear dramatic prevision. The fates of such characters as he left\r\nunrelated in “Noli Me Tangere” he follows to the end, but on the way\r\nstops to picture lives and conditions not vitally interwoven with the\r\nclimacteric. Yet in one way this book is the superior in interest, for\r\nit reveals the change that had been coming over him in these two years.\r\nSlowly there had been erased in his creed the belief in the good\r\nintentions of Spain; slowly (and reluctantly, no doubt) he had come to\r\nface the thought that to appeal to Spain for reforms was useless and\r\nthe Filipinos must achieve by their own efforts the changes that would\r\nlead to their redemption. That these efforts must be of a peaceful\r\ncharacter was a sheet-anchor of faith to which he still clung, or tried\r\nto cling, and yet there is evidence that he felt it dragging as more\r\nand more the hopeless stupidity of Spain was revealed to him. [117]\r\n\r\nEvidence of the change in his essential point of view may be found even\r\nin the dedication of the new book. It is boldly and uncompromisingly to\r\nthe men that, perishing on Bagumbayan Field, in 1872, the gored victims\r\nof the System, made their names immortal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    To the memory of the priests [it reads], Don Mariano Gomez (85\r\n    years old), Don José Burgos (30 years old), and Don Jacinto Zamora\r\n    (35 years old), executed in Bagumbayan Field, February 28, 1872.\r\n\r\n    The church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt the\r\n    crime that has been imputed to you; the Government, by surrounding\r\n    your trials with mystery and shadows, causes the belief that there\r\n    was some error, committed in fatal moments; and all the\r\n    Philippines, by worshiping your memory and calling you martyrs, in\r\n    no sense recognizes your culpability. In so far, therefore, as your\r\n    complicity in the Cavite mutiny is not clearly proved, as you may\r\n    or may not have been patriots, and as you may or may not have\r\n    cherished sentiments for justice and for liberty, I have the right\r\n    to dedicate my work to you as victims of the evil that I undertake\r\n    to combat. And while we await expectantly under Spain some day to\r\n    restore your good name and cease to be answerable for your death,\r\n    let these pages serve as a tardy wreath of dried leaves over your\r\n    unknown tombs, and let it be understood that every one that without\r\n    clear proof attacks your memory, stains his hands in your blood!\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a foretaste of the strange, new, and passionate bitterness that\r\nwas coming upon him, not heretofore discernible in his writings nor in\r\nhis life, the nettle smart of a growing disillusion. Something there\r\nis, too, that in another man would surely savor of cynicism. “You may\r\nor may not have been patriots,” “You may or may not have cherished\r\nsentiments for justice and for liberty,” are phrases not of a piece\r\nwith his old-time faith. The wormwood that flavors these few lines is\r\nperceptible throughout the book. In “Noli Me Tangere” the stern\r\narraignment of the friars and the Spanish officers is modulated with\r\nmany good-natured pictures of Philippine life, with descriptions of the\r\nbeautiful Philippine country-side, and with gentle fun-making of\r\npopular follies. In the sequel [118] there are no relieving touches. It\r\nis hot metal always overflowing and burning whatever it touches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPHILIPPINE INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nSixteen years after Jagor printed his almost unheeded prophecy, other\r\nmen less gifted might have seen that his views on Philippine evolution\r\nwere soundly based. The conditions existing in the Islands could not\r\nlast much longer. Six or seven discontented millions could not continue\r\nto be overawed with soldiery and great guns and managed upon a plan\r\nthey hated. No matter how assiduously they might be kept from all\r\nweapons more deadly than jack-knives and toothpicks, the existing state\r\ncould not endure. The mere physical fact of the United States, forging\r\nahead upon a totally different principle, would be an influence that\r\nsoon or late would overturn these sagging bulwarks of antiquity. What\r\nwas to be the future of the Islands? For a long time the students of\r\nBarcelona tried to settle this question, sometimes with debate and\r\nsometimes with vociferation. Thence with similar futility it spread to\r\nMadrid and elsewhere, and finally Rizal took it up in a series of\r\narticles entitled “The Philippines a Century Hence.” [119]\r\n\r\nWhat he thought about Philippine independence he here set down as\r\nplainly as the law and the Spanish Government would allow. That any one\r\nshould try to muddle his views on this subject is strange enough when\r\nhe left thus a testament reasonably explicit in its text and still more\r\nin its deductions. Although much latitude was allowed to public\r\ndiscussion in the Spain of that day, plotting to overthrow Spanish rule\r\nin the Philippines was still sedition, and under that term the police\r\nsometimes included much that was extraneous—in Spain, as elsewhere.\r\nRizal had no fear for himself on this occasion nor any other, but one\r\ncan easily understand that he wished to save “La Solidaridad” from the\r\nash-can. Hence with admirable skill he steers as close as he can to the\r\nforbidden line and yet escapes it.\r\n\r\nAgainst one bugaboo of the timid, and even to this day a favorite\r\ndevice of the crafty, he brought to bear a destructive logic. It was\r\nurged that if the Philippines were free they would instantly be snapped\r\nup by some powerful and greedy neighbor. The functions of a shield\r\nagainst these ravenous wild beasts, a function later supposed to be\r\nperformed unselfishly by the United States, was then imagined to fall\r\nto the lot of mighty Spain. But for her frowning guns and men-of-war,\r\nbehold the Philippines a breakfast any morning for Japan or for Great\r\nBritain! In those days there were a few Filipinos that were impressed\r\nwith these fantasies, or said to be; in later times the superior white\r\nman often seemed strangely infected with them. To one inclined to take\r\nthem seriously Rizal’s words might have been commended then, or may be\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIt appears that he had been applying to his country the lessons of the\r\nAmerican Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If the Philippines [he says] succeed in winning their independence\r\n    at the close of a heroic and bitterly contested war, their people\r\n    can rest assured that neither England, Germany, France, nor Holland\r\n    will dare to pick up the territory that Spain could not retain.\r\n    Within a few years, Africa will absorb all the attention of the\r\n    great European nations, and none of them would neglect the immense\r\n    territories and opportunities that will open in the Dark Continent\r\n    for the sake of a handful of rugged islands at the other end of the\r\n    world.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to England, she has already enough of colonies in the Orient, and\r\nshe is too wise to imperil her equilibrium by adding more. She does not\r\nwish to run the risk of losing her great empire in India for the sake\r\nof the comparatively poorer Philippine Archipelago. If England had even\r\nthought of taking the Philippines, she would never have retired from\r\nManila after she had captured it in 1763; she would have retained that\r\ngreat vantage-point and so would have spread her power from Island to\r\nIsland until all should be hers. For her the game was not worth the\r\ncandle, and is not. Singapore, Hong-Kong, Shanghai, mean much more to\r\nBritish trade and the empire than the Philippines could ever mean, and\r\nshe has no idea of risking these great possessions for the sake of a\r\ndomain so dubious and restless as these Islands. For all reasons of\r\ncommon sense and commercial advantage, England would look with favor\r\nupon a state of independence that would open the Philippine ports to\r\nBritish trade.\r\n\r\nThere is, besides, in England a feeling always growing that the country\r\nhas gone too far in imperialism and expansion, that the colonies have\r\nalready begun to weaken the mother-country and there must be no\r\nadditions to them.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds next to discuss the probable policies of Germany, China,\r\nHolland, Japan, and the United States toward Philippine independence.\r\nNone of them, in his view, would feel any temptation to interfere with\r\nit or to seize the Islands for itself. But, in any event, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Philippines would defend with the utmost ardor and courage the\r\n    liberty bought with so much blood and sacrifice. A new man will\r\n    spring from the Philippine bosom; with new energy he will dedicate\r\n    himself to progress; he will labor with all his resources to\r\n    strengthen his country at home and abroad. Gold will be dug from\r\n    the Philippine soil; copper, lead, coal, and other minerals will be\r\n    developed. The country will revive the maritime and mercantile\r\n    activities to which the Islanders are especially adapted by nature,\r\n    instincts, and aptitude. Filipinas will recover those good\r\n    qualities that she had centuries ago and has since been losing.\r\n    [120] Easily, then, we can see her once more a lover of peace, a\r\n    home of justice, and as of old merry, smiling, hospitable,\r\n    audacious.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe recounts then some of the existing evils in his country and inquires\r\nwhat, if one can imagine another century of such servitude, the\r\nPhilippines will be reduced to in that time? But without circumlocution\r\nhe warns the Government that the servitude cannot possibly continue.\r\nUnless the prudence of the Government provides remedies that are real,\r\nthe grievances now accumulating will have but one result.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is not the time to forecast the probable outcome of such a\r\n    struggle if, most deplorably, it should come. It would depend upon\r\n    faith, zeal, the qualities of weapons, and a million conditions\r\n    that men cannot foresee. But one thing is certain. Suppose all the\r\n    advantages to be upon the side of the Government. Suppose the\r\n    Government to win an ostensible victory. It would be a victory as\r\n    disastrous as a defeat, and this simple fact the Government should\r\n    be wise enough to see.\r\n\r\n    If those that seek to guide the destinies of the Philippines could\r\n    be so obstinate as to insist upon holding the country in darkness\r\n    instead of relieving it with adequate reforms, the people would\r\n    brave the chances of revolt and prefer revolt’s hazards, whatever\r\n    they might be, to the certainty of the misery and wrong in which\r\n    they would be dwelling. What would they lose in such a fight? To\r\n    normal men the choice between long-drawn-out oppression and a\r\n    glorious death is no choice at all. Such men will always leap at\r\n    the chance of such a death and by their fervor and desperate\r\n    courage go far in any such conflict to make up for a disparity in\r\n    numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe points out the fact that so far in Philippine history the revolts\r\nhave been sporadic and largely local. Earnestly he warns the Government\r\nthat this cannot continue. Very different would be the uprising of the\r\nwhole people against a state of unendurable misery, and toward such an\r\nuprising the policy of the Government is driving. It is to be\r\nremembered, he says, that factors in the problem exist now that never\r\nexisted before. First, the native spirit has awakened and common\r\nmisfortune is drawing together all the children of the Islands. Second,\r\nthe growth of intelligence at home and abroad is fatal to the existing\r\norder. All those Filipinos that the cruelty and stupidity of the\r\nGovernment have driven abroad have learned there the rhythm of the\r\nmarch of mankind and are transmitting it home. It is a class that\r\nrapidly increases. If it is the brain of the country now, it will in a\r\nfew years be the country’s nervous system, and of impact upon those\r\nnerves let the Government beware.\r\n\r\nOne of two things, he concludes, is certain. Spain will grant sweeping\r\nreforms in the islands, establishing there the liberties and advantages\r\nthat all civilized people view as birthrights. Or the islands will\r\ndeclare their independence, after staining themselves and Spain with\r\nblood. To check the advance of the Filipinos to this crisis Spain has\r\nin effect but three weapons. First, the brutalizing effect upon the\r\nmasses of a caste system; the high caste, as always, alined with the\r\nGovernment. Second, the supremacy of a theocratic class in the\r\nPhilippine structure, acting to overawe the natives, as in the Dutch\r\ncolonies the aristocratic class frightens them. Or, third, the\r\nimpoverishment of the country, the encouragement of tribal discord, and\r\nthe gradual destruction of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAlready these expedients have been tried enough to prove them worthless\r\nfor Spain’s ultimate use.\r\n\r\nOne little fact that he points out might well be remembered by all\r\nimperialists. Where the aborigines of a seized country, as in\r\nAustralia, succumb and disappear before the alien civilization, that\r\nmakes one situation for the invader. Where the inhabitants, as in the\r\nPhilippines, adapt themselves to the invader’s civilization, show they\r\ncan maintain themselves under it, increase in numbers and in\r\nrestlessness, bettering the instruction they receive, the situation for\r\nthe alien sovereignty is different and not wholesome.\r\n\r\nStill his hope clung to peaceful agitation as the means of improvement.\r\n\r\nRetana says that Rizal was one that abhorred violent revolution in his\r\nmind and desired it in his heart.\r\n\r\nThis might easily be. At the time Rizal was studying abroad, many\r\ncities such as London, Paris, Hong-Kong, Macao, as well as Madrid,\r\ncontained small colonies of Filipinos, being chiefly the exiles of 1872\r\nand Cavite. Among them it was customary to circulate pamphlets\r\nbreathing out destruction to Spanish rule in the Philippines, and so\r\non. These the authors were usually wise enough not to sign, the chief\r\npurpose of their labors being, apparently, not so much to launch\r\nexpeditions for the overthrow of the citadel of oppression as to cheer\r\nthe hearts of exile with verbal fireworks. One of these came out in\r\nMarch, 1889, in Hong-Kong, but widely circulated wherever there were\r\nFilipinos. It is a race that, like the others, has good men and bad,\r\nmen that go erect and those that crawl. One of the latter species, a\r\ncreature of Weyler of the Red Hands, was then living in Hong-Kong and\r\nfelt called upon to answer the inflammatory appeals of his countrymen.\r\nPerhaps he was not much of a Filipino; perhaps he was, in the bulk,\r\nSpaniard. At least he said in his document that Spain’s rule in the\r\nPhilippines was the grandest specimen of colonial wisdom ever known and\r\nreplete with good things for the people. As to the friars, he said that\r\nno possible objection existed to them, for they were kind, gentle, fond\r\nof the people, and wholly given to good works. So he warned his\r\ncountrymen to pay no attention to ribald persons that wrote otherwise,\r\nfor they but walked the straight road to destruction.\r\n\r\nCopies of this unique production made their way to Europe and in the\r\nend to Paris, where Rizal was then living. In October of that year,\r\n1889, appeared in Paris a rejoinder to sycophancy that set on edge the\r\nteeth of every Filipino in Europe. It was unsigned, but to the colonies\r\nthe authorship seemed unmistakable. Only one Filipino could write like\r\nthat; only one Filipino could wither with such disdainful sarcasm the\r\napologist for the wrongers of his country.\r\n\r\nThe manifesto closes with this paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When a people is torn asunder, when its dignity, its honor, and all\r\n    its liberties are trodden underfoot; when now no legal recourse\r\n    remains against the tyranny of its oppressors; when its complaints,\r\n    its supplications, and its groans are not listened to; when it is\r\n    not even allowed to cry; when its last hope is torn from its heart\r\n    ... then ... then ... then! ... there remains no other remedy but\r\n    to snatch with delirious hand, from the accursed altars, the bloody\r\n    and suicidal dagger of revolution!\r\n\r\n    Cæsar, we, who are about to die, salute thee! [121]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the Filipinos in Europe could hardly have been wrong.\r\nThere is every reason to hold with them that the writer of this fierce\r\ncry of warning was Rizal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFILIPINO INDOLENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indio that had startled the Spanish colony in Manila by daring to\r\ncall the Philippines “my fatherland” proved his loyalty to the country\r\nhe adored by serving it with a discriminating zeal. He would have been\r\nmore picturesque if he had been well galvanized by Chauvin, but less\r\nuseful. His mind, though powerful, could work in only one way, which\r\nwas in orderly motions. These prevented him from dwelling so much on\r\nhis country’s wrongs that he forgot his country’s faults. For this\r\nreason, and because he could have no heated bearings in his mental\r\nprocesses, he was Filipinas’s greatest asset. In “Noli Me Tangere” he\r\nshowed that he understood well the native defects (products of the\r\nSystem) and would spare them no more than he spared the friars. But it\r\nwas for his countrymen’s good that he rebuked them, like a wise father\r\ncorrecting his children; and whatever might be his employments he never\r\nforgot two great vital visions, Filipinas fast bound in the\r\nprison-house and education tardily on its way to set her free.\r\n\r\nWith the same purpose of helping this good angel the sooner to smite\r\nthe prison locks, he now set himself an unusual task. He was to master\r\nFrench; not after the fashion of the schools, for that he already had,\r\nnor for the mere pleasure of acquiring it, but to be able to write in\r\nit as if it were his native tongue. He knew what he was about in this;\r\nif his novels should fail to arouse the Filipinos he was determined to\r\nappeal to Europe in behalf of his country, and he conceived that he\r\ncould best do this in French. Therefore with indefatigable ardor he\r\npursued the French verb and the other phenomena of Gallic speech into\r\ntheir remotest fastnesses. He took what might be called\r\npost-postgraduate work in these arid excursions, employing the help of\r\nunusual scholars and including colloquial French with French of the\r\nAcademy. When we come upon the fact that at the end of these labors he\r\nwas able to prepare as a text-book for French students a volume of\r\nFrench exercises [122] we may perceive that his success was out of the\r\nordinary.\r\n\r\nIn Paris when the exposition of 1889 came on he was struck with the\r\nfact that in that vast and imposing procession of the children of earth\r\nhis own people, whom he felt and knew to be as worthy as the others,\r\nhad no place. Therefore he organized an international league to make\r\nknown to the world the facts about the Filipinos and to refute the\r\nslanders that Spanish writers had sown thickly in European literature.\r\nHe called this society the “Association Internationale des\r\nPhilippinistes.” Dr. Blumentritt was president, Dr. Rost\r\nvice-president, and Dr. Planchut of Paris one of the directors. [123]\r\nIf Rizal was a nationalist, he was also an internationalist; a fact\r\nthat must be already apparent in these annals. No doubt, being wise\r\nabout other things, he was not deceived into thinking that\r\ninternationalism could come by any other than the nationalist route.\r\nThe first of the declared objects of his Association Internationale was\r\nto summon an international congress. Others were to study the\r\nPhilippines historically and scientifically, to create a Philippine\r\nlibrary and museum of Philippine objects, to publish books on\r\nPhilippine topics, and to arouse public interest in these objects.\r\n\r\nThat the world looked with some disdain upon his people, that under the\r\nspell of the Spanish pen it ignored the honorable record of Philippine\r\nculture and the stirring Philippine history, were thorns that gave his\r\nmind no rest. None knew so well as he that this misprision was rankly\r\nunjust. In the face of almost universal opinion in Europe, he knew that\r\nthe Malay mind, though different, was not inferior; he knew that what\r\nit wanted was no more than the sunlight and free air. In all ways the\r\ngeneral verdict was askew: the Filipinos were not even innately lazy,\r\nas hundreds of writers had asserted, hundreds still repeated, and\r\ndoubtless other hundreds will continue to parrot for years to come. He\r\nknew that lazy people could never have made the progress the Filipino\r\nhad made before the evil day of the Spanish flag. The respect he had\r\nfor the latent powers of his countrymen sprang from research and not\r\nfrom prejudice. It was true enough, but not a truth that he could keep\r\nrefrigerated in scientific abstractions. It burned and struggled in him\r\nlike something fighting to get free, and he relieved himself of an\r\nintolerable protest by writing (for “La Solidaridad”) a brochure on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“The Indolence of the Filipino” [124] it is called, and, if he had\r\nwritten nothing else, thoughtful men would still admire him for the\r\ncool, masterly marshaling of his reasonings in this. He purposes to\r\ndeal with the truth. “Let us calmly examine the facts,” he says in\r\nbeginning, “using on our part all the impartiality of which a man is\r\ncapable who is convinced that there is no redemption except upon solid\r\nbases of virtue.” Two pages later he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Examining well, then, all the scenes and all the men that we have\r\n    known from childhood, and examining the life of our country, we\r\n    believe that indolence does exist there. The Filipinos, who can\r\n    measure up with the most active peoples in the world, will\r\n    doubtless not repudiate this admission, for it is true that in the\r\n    Philippines one works and struggles against the climate, against\r\n    nature, and against man. But we must not take the exception for the\r\n    general rule, and should rather seek the good of our country by\r\n    stating what we believe to be true. We must confess that indolence\r\n    does actually and positively exist there, only that, instead of\r\n    holding it to be the cause of the backwardness and the troubles of\r\n    the country, we regard it as the effect of the troubles and the\r\n    backwardness, by the fostering of a lamentable predisposition....\r\n    [125]\r\n\r\n    The predisposition exists. Why should it not?\r\n\r\n    A hot climate requires of the individual quiet and rest, just as\r\n    cold invites to labor and action. For this reason the Spaniard is\r\n    more indolent than the Frenchman, the Frenchman more indolent than\r\n    the German. The Europeans themselves that so liberally reproach the\r\n    residents of the colonies (and I am not now speaking of the\r\n    Spaniards but of the Germans and English themselves), how do they\r\n    live in tropical countries? Surrounded with a numerous train of\r\n    servants, never going about but riding in a carriage, needing\r\n    servants not only to take off their shoes for them but even to fan\r\n    them! And yet they live and eat better, they work for themselves,\r\n    they look for riches, they hope for a future, free and respected,\r\n    while the poor colonist, the indolent colonist, is badly nourished,\r\n    has no hope, toils for others, and works under force and\r\n    compulsion!\r\n\r\n    Perhaps the reply to this will be that the white men are not made\r\n    to stand the severity of the climate. A mistake! A man can live in\r\n    any climate, if he will only adapt himself to its requirements and\r\n    conditions.\r\n\r\n    What kills the Europeans in hot countries is the abuse of liquors,\r\n    the attempt to live according to the nature of his own country\r\n    under another sky and another sun. We inhabitants of hot countries\r\n    live well in northern Europe whenever we take the precautions the\r\n    people there take. Likewise Europeans can endure the torrid zone if\r\n    they will but rid themselves of their prejudices.\r\n\r\n    The fact is that in tropical countries violent work is not a good\r\n    thing as it is in cold countries. In tropical countries it is\r\n    death, destruction, annihilation. Nature knows this and has\r\n    therefore made the earth in tropical countries more fertile, more\r\n    productive, as a compensation. An hour’s work under that burning\r\n    sun, in the midst of the pernicious influence springing from nature\r\n    in activity, is equal to a day’s work in a temperate climate. It is\r\n    just, then, that the earth should yield a hundredfold! [126]\r\n\r\n    Moreover, do we not see the active European, who has gained\r\n    strength during the winter, who feels the fresh blood of spring\r\n    boil in his veins, do we not see him abandon his labors during the\r\n    few days of his variable summer, close his office—where the work is\r\n    not, after all, violent, where, in many cases, it amounts to\r\n    talking and gesticulating in the shade or near a luncheon stand—do\r\n    we not see him flee to watering-places where he sits idle in the\r\n    cafés or idly strolls about? What wonder then that the inhabitant\r\n    of tropical countries, worn out and with his blood thinned by the\r\n    continuous and excessive heat, is reduced to inaction! Who is the\r\n    indolent one in the Manila offices? Is it the poor clerk who comes\r\n    in at 8 in the morning and leaves at 4 in the afternoon with only\r\n    his umbrella, who copies and writes and works for himself and for\r\n    his chief, or is it the chief, who comes in a carriage at 10\r\n    o’clock, leaves before 12, reads his newspaper while smoking and,\r\n    with his feet cocked up on a chair or a table, gossips about all\r\n    his friends?\r\n\r\n    Man is not a brute; he is not a machine. His object is not merely\r\n    to produce; in spite of the pretensions of some Christian whites\r\n    who would make of the colored Christian a kind of motive-power\r\n    somewhat more intelligent and less costly than steam. [127]\r\n\r\n\r\nRizal found that in regard to indolence the Philippines were like a\r\npatient with a long continued disease. The doctor attributes the\r\nfailure of his medicines to the debility of the patient’s system, and\r\nthe patient ascribes his debilitated condition to the doctor’s\r\nremedies. He followed his illustration by remarking that, as in the\r\ncase of a desperate illness, so in the government of the Philippines,\r\nthe attendants seemed to lose their heads and, instead of seeking the\r\ncauses of the disease to remove them, devoted themselves to attacking\r\nthe symptoms, with here blood-letting (taxation), there a plaster\r\n(forced labor), and there a sedative (trifling reform).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Every new arrival proposes a new remedy: one, seasons of prayer,\r\n    the relics of a saint, the viaticum, the friars; another, a\r\n    shower-bath; still another, with pretensions to modern ideas, a\r\n    transfusion of the blood [that is to say, an agricultural colony of\r\n    Europeans]. It’s nothing, only the patient has eight million\r\n    indolent red corpuscles [Filipinos]; some few white corpuscles in\r\n    the form of an agricultural colony will get us out of the\r\n    trouble.... [128]\r\n\r\n    Yes, transfusion of blood, transfusion of blood! New life, new\r\n    vitality! Yes, the new white corpuscles that you are going to\r\n    inject into its veins, the new white corpuscles that were a cancer\r\n    in another organism, will withstand all the depravity of the\r\n    system, will withstand the blood-letting that it suffers every day,\r\n    will have more stamina than all the eight million red corpuscles,\r\n    will cure all the disorders, all the degeneration, all troubles in\r\n    the principal organs.\r\n\r\n    Be thankful if they do not become coagulations and produce\r\n    gangrene; be thankful if they do not reproduce the cancer!\r\n\r\n\r\nHe comes then to the central fact he has undertaken to establish. Here\r\nit is in the teeth of the plausible assertions of prejudice and the\r\nselfish interests that depreciate the natives:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Indolence in the Philippines is a chronic, but not a hereditary\r\n    malady.\r\n\r\n    The Filipinos have not always been what they are. Witnesses to this\r\n    statement are all the historians of the first years after the\r\n    discovery of the islands. [129]\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before the coming of the Spaniards the Malayan Filipinos had an\r\norganized and outstretching commerce, foreign as well as domestic. A\r\nChinese writer of the thirteenth century has recorded their intimate\r\ncommercial relations with China, the probity and zeal of the Filipino\r\nmerchants, the great extent of the trade they carried on. They exported\r\ncotton, cloth, pearls, tortoise-shell, betel-nuts, and other\r\ncommodities the making or preparing or gathering of which meant\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nPigafetta, a Spanish writer with Magellan, speaks of the great variety\r\nof the island products. The natives worked mines, produced and wrought\r\nin metals, made ingenious and effective weapons, wove silk into their\r\nartistic dresses, and even made false teeth of gold. Their agricultural\r\nproducts were of kinds not to be had without labor.\r\n\r\nThe early Spaniards reported the Filipinos to be daring and\r\nindefatigable sailors, whose fleets of merchantmen covered the waters\r\nof the Islands and made far voyages, even regularly to Siam. Filipino\r\nsoldiers fought in the wars of other countries. In 1539 they took part\r\nin the wars of Sumatra, and it was their valor that overthrew there a\r\nrenowned potentate, the sultan of Atchin.\r\n\r\nMagellan’s people testified that industriously the Filipinos tilled the\r\nsoil, each man having his own field. It was a wealthy country:\r\nfood-stuffs were abundant, the natives were well fed. Legaspi’s\r\nexpedition (about 1591) reported again on their large variety of\r\nproducts, including manufactures of iron, porcelain and cloth. Nowhere\r\nwas to be noted poverty or savagery; business had attained to an\r\nexcellent growth. The natives knew something about the rest of the\r\nworld; there were even among them, before a Spanish ship had ever\r\nanchored in Philippine waters, men that knew the Spanish language,\r\nhaving no doubt acquired it in their travels. When Cebu, a city of one\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants, was burned with all its food-supplies,\r\nits people did not suffer hunger, because the surrounding country\r\nquickly and intelligently organized to meet the emergency with abundant\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\r\n    All the histories of those first years, in short, abound in long\r\n    accounts about the industry and agriculture of the natives: mines,\r\n    gold-washings, looms, farms, barter, naval construction, raising of\r\n    poultry and stock, weaving of silk and cotton, distilleries,\r\n    manufactures of arms, pearl fisheries, the civet industry, the horn\r\n    and hide industry, etc., are things encountered at every step, and,\r\n    considering the time and the conditions in the Islands, prove that\r\n    there was life, there was activity, there was movement. [130]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe cites de Morga to show that indolence came upon the Filipinos after\r\nthe Spanish domination and was not conspicuous before that time. De\r\nMorga’s seven years as lieutenant-governor of Manila should have\r\ninstructed him about this, when he says that the natives under the\r\nSpaniards lost some of the trades in which they had been most\r\nsuccessful. They had even forgotten much about farming, the raising of\r\npoultry, of live stock, of cotton, about the weaving of cloth as they\r\nused to weave it in their paganism and for a time after their country\r\nhad been conquered.\r\n\r\nOther Spaniards of that period bore witness to the same decline; and\r\ngenerations later a German traveler, observing the differences between\r\nthe habits of the natives under Spanish rule and of those that were\r\nstill unsubdued, asked if the industrious free peoples would not in\r\ntheir turn become indolent when Christianity and Spain should be forced\r\nupon them. “The Filipinos,” Rizal justly concludes from these\r\ntestimonies, “in spite of the climate, in spite of their few needs\r\n(they were less then than now), were not the indolent creatures of our\r\ntime.” [131]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, brought them down from their normal standards of activity\r\nand enterprise?\r\n\r\nA fatal combination of causes, he finds.\r\n\r\nFirst, the continual wars and the insurrections that were provoked by\r\nSpanish cruelty. When there was no civil strife abroad in the\r\nPhilippines, able-bodied men were drafted to fight for Spain in Borneo\r\nor Indo-China; or there were huge expeditions, usually failures, that\r\ntook away thousands of the best young men and never returned them. He\r\nquotes the Spanish writer, Gaspar de San Agustin, showing how one\r\nformerly populous town had been greatly shorn of inhabitants because,\r\nbeing noted as sailors and oarsmen, the Government took them for\r\nforeign service. [132] In this way, the island of Panay, which had\r\nfifty thousand families when the Spaniards came, had been reduced to\r\nfifteen thousand.\r\n\r\nTen years after the Legaspi expedition, that is to say, in 1581, sixty\r\nyears after Magellan’s “discovery,” the islands had lost one third of\r\nthe total population. [133]\r\n\r\nOf course, it was the young, the hardy, the capable, the industrious\r\nthat went by this route to further the cold schemes of Spanish\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nUnder such a drain faded the moral and material resources of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nSecond, we are to remember the ravages of the pirates. Before the days\r\nof Magellan these audacious plunderers had with avidity pursued their\r\ncalling in Philippine waters, but what is not generally known is that\r\ntheir activities greatly increased under the Spanish domination. The\r\nSpaniards encouraged the pirates, not to prey upon Spanish settlements,\r\nbut to terrorize remote populations, to make them amenable to Spanish\r\nrule, in some instances to disclose what weapons the natives had that\r\nthese might be snatched from them, and sometimes merely to be rid of\r\nobjectionable communities. As the pirates did a thriving commerce in\r\nslaves, to eliminate, with their help, the undesirable was easy. De\r\nMorga says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The boldness of these people of Mindanao [pirates] did great damage\r\n    to the Visayan Islands, as much by what they did in them as by the\r\n    fear and fright that the natives acquired; because the natives were\r\n    in the power of the Spaniards, who held them subject and tributary\r\n    and unarmed, in such manner that they did not protect them from\r\n    their enemies nor leave them means with which to defend themselves\r\n    as they did when there were no Spaniards in the country. [134]\r\n\r\n\r\nRizal lays the emphasis of capitals upon this last phrase, which indeed\r\nseems powerful evidence, coming from such a source.\r\n\r\nThe pirates came every year, sometimes five times, sometimes ten, and\r\nan average visit cost the Islands more than eight hundred persons.\r\n\r\nGaspar de San Agustin tells of an Island near Cebu that by 1608 the\r\npirates had almost depopulated and points to the fact that the natives\r\nhad no defense.\r\n\r\nThird, forced labor. This was a grievous matter: again and again it\r\ndrove the Filipinos to revolt, but the Spaniards would learn nothing\r\nand to the last clung to a thing certain to wreck them. Its evils were\r\nfirst manifest in the ship-building enterprises the Spaniards\r\nundertook. They found the Filipinos among the best natural\r\nship-builders in the world, having constructed, as before noted, some\r\nof the largest vessels then afloat. Other great vessels were planned by\r\nthe Spaniards, and to get out quickly the needed timbers they compelled\r\nthousands of natives to work without pay and to provide their own food;\r\na viler than ordinary form of slavery. To get out the masts for one\r\ngalleon, six thousand natives were employed for three months, finding\r\ntheir own subsistence. Trees large enough to furnish these masts grew\r\nonly in the interior; the labor of moving them through jungle and over\r\nmountains was enormous. Fernando de los Rios Coronel says that “the\r\nsurrounding country had to be depopulated” in the ship-building work\r\nand that the natives furnished the timbers “with immense labor, damage,\r\nand cost to themselves.” San Agustin says that “the continual labor of\r\ncutting timber for his Majesty’s shipyards” was a great cause of the\r\ndecline in population because it hindered people “from cultivating the\r\nvery fertile plain they have.”\r\n\r\nFourth, taxes and the cruelty of the Government. De los Rios Coronel\r\ncites “the natives that were executed, those that left their wives and\r\nchildren and fled in disgust to the mountains, those that were sold\r\ninto slavery to pay the taxes levied upon them,” among the elements\r\ndisappearing from the population. There were also, it appears from San\r\nAgustin, to be added “those flogged to death, women crushed to death by\r\ntheir heavy burdens, those that sleep in the fields and there bear and\r\nnurse their children and die bitten by poisonous vermin, the many that\r\nare executed or left to die of hunger, those that eat poisonous herbs,\r\nand the mothers that kill their children in bearing them.” [135] It is\r\nnot an exhilarating picture; to believe it we must remind ourselves\r\nthat it is limned by Spaniards: it can have no impulse to a hostile\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\nThe fields once cleared ceased to be cultivated; the towns once\r\nflourishing lost population and trade. The Filipino was launched on a\r\nbackward career. Because,\r\n\r\nFifth, there was the psychological or spiritual fruitage of all this\r\nlethargy.\r\n\r\nWorse than all the others and the culminating cause, this was. The\r\nFilipino’s spirit sank under the alien yoke. It appears that he no\r\nlonger cared; what was there to care for? Spanish polity offered him in\r\nexchange for his lost liberty here only the prospect of salvation in\r\nanother life. The bargain was not stimulating. Salvation depended in no\r\ndegree upon terrestrial industry; the idle were saved equally with the\r\nactive. We think, besides, that a racial spring was touched too fine to\r\nbe suspected by the trampling soldiers that Spain sent over to walk\r\nupon these bowed necks. The Malay responds to kindness; under blows,\r\ncompulsion, or superior brute force he retires within himself into a\r\nsullen apathy. This now fell upon the native wherever the Spanish flag\r\nwaved and to the extent that the Spanish methods prevailed. To go\r\nbeyond Rizal’s able treatise and to record what even he could not have\r\nexpected, the Americans, when their day came, noted with astonishment\r\nthat the Filipinos of the South were more active, industrious, and\r\nresilient than their brothers in the North, although this was to\r\nreverse the usual order of nature. Some Americans ascribed the\r\nSoutherner’s advantage to his religion and credited to Mohammedanism a\r\nvirtue it hardly possessed. The real explanation, which abundantly\r\nconfirms Rizal’s thesis, is that the Southerner had never gone under\r\nthe lethal yoke of the Spanish conception of society.\r\n\r\nEven when actual slavery was not enforced upon the native, the returns\r\nfor his labor and efforts were so meager and uncertain he had no longer\r\nan incentive to work. There was a kind of padrone or contractor called\r\nthe encomendero to whom the people of a district were virtually\r\ndelivered over that he might extract from them all available profit and\r\nsteer back to Spain with both pockets stuffed with the gold he had\r\nwrung from their toil. Usually this person had no other interest than\r\nto make his exit as early as possible and as heavily laden, to the\r\nwhich ends conscience should be no hindrance. He robbed the natives of\r\nproduce where he could not steal labor; he used false measures in\r\nbuying and selling. The unhappy Filipinos had no appeal. In one town\r\nwhere a particularly brutal encomendero exacted additional tribute by\r\nusing a steelyard twice as long as it should have been, they rose and\r\ntried to kill him—it appears, unfortunately, without success. [136]\r\n\r\nDe San Agustin gives these practices as the reason why the gold-mines\r\nof Panay, once “very rich,” had ceased to be worked; the natives\r\npreferred to live in poverty rather than to work under the conditions\r\nimposed upon them. Exploitation was the business of the Spaniard (from\r\nthe governor down), and the only business that seems to have been\r\nattended to with diligence. To get rich quickly and to get home to\r\nspend the money was the real inspiration, an impulse not unknown in\r\nother parts of the earth where with his trusty rifle the white man has\r\nimposed his peculiar civilization upon his dark-skinned brother. In\r\nsome places the dark brother under these ministrations lies down and\r\ndies; in the Philippines he ceased to work except under the lash or\r\nwhen he was fomenting an insurrection. Reviewing these facts the\r\nsuperior wisdom supposed to lurk mysteriously under the white skin\r\nseems to require much explanation.\r\n\r\nRizal points out that while in his time the pirates had ceased from\r\ntroubling and the Dutch colonists were at rest, the other causes of the\r\nFilipino uneasiness went on undiminished to a loud chorus of\r\ndenunciation from the elements responsible for these evils. As usual,\r\nnames had shifted, the essentials of exploitation were unchanged. The\r\nencomendero was no longer the commanding figure in the process of\r\nextracting and coining the toilers’ sweat; it was now the local\r\ngovernor, the friar, or both, but the machinery in use was the same. He\r\nquotes a French traveler of his own time that observed with\r\nastonishment the operations of a typical governor in whose hands “the\r\nhigh and noble functions he performs are nothing more than instruments\r\nof gain. He monopolizes all the business and instead of developing the\r\nlove of work, instead of stimulating the natives to overcome the too\r\nnatural indolence, he with the abuse of his powers thinks only of\r\ndestroying all competition that may trouble him or attempt to\r\nparticipate in his profits. It matters little to him that the country\r\nis impoverished, without commerce, without industry, if only the\r\ngovernor is quickly enriched.” [137]\r\n\r\nThe whole story deserves the attention of mankind; the debacle and its\r\ncauses. It is a simulacrum of exploitation and exploitation’s fatal\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nTo do business in the Philippines, as we understand business, was\r\nalmost impossible, year of grace 1890, so numerous were the obstacles,\r\ndocuments, papers, signatures, tangles of red tape to be unwound,\r\nofficers to be bribed. If there is no commerce, how can there be\r\nindustry? If there is no industry what shall the masses of people do\r\nbut idle? “The most commercial and most industrious countries have been\r\nthe freest,” says Rizal; “France, England, and the United States prove\r\nthis. Hong-Kong, while it is not worth the most insignificant of the\r\nPhilippines, has more commercial movement than all these Islands\r\ntogether because it is free and well governed.”\r\n\r\nThe Spanish aristocrats in the Islands contributed to the general\r\nimpulse to indolence. They posed as superior persons and exalted\r\nmodels, yet they did no work and despised all that labored. The vice of\r\ngambling, which the Spaniards deliberately encouraged in the natives,\r\nadded to the general stagnation; not only cock-fighting (officially\r\nprotected and a source of government revenue) but other gaming. It is a\r\npassion to which the Malay blood seems peculiarly susceptible, as the\r\nChinese are to opium-smoking. Under government encouragement gambling\r\nbecame almost a native obsession wherever the Spanish rule was\r\nstrongest. Having taught them to gamble, the Spaniards denounced the\r\nFilipinos as a race of gamblers; but this was again a species of\r\ninjustice of which the Spaniard had no monopoly. It is easy to instance\r\nwhite communities that refuse to allow colored men to perform any but\r\nmenial offices and then despise them as a race of menials. As to this\r\npractice in the United States of America, for example, reference may\r\nprofitably be had to the pointed comments of Mr. George Bernard Shaw.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is the natural business of the Islands. Hebetudinous\r\ngovernment in Rizal’s time did nothing to encourage or even to defend\r\nit. The farmer went his way, preyed upon by the most villainous system\r\nof interest pillage so far disclosed in human affairs, [138] and the\r\nGovernment gave him never so much as a friendly word. When crops\r\nfailed, when typhoons wrought huge destruction, when the plague of\r\nlocusts turned some great green valley to naked desolation, the\r\nGovernment looked on indifferently and sent another tax collector.\r\n\r\nIt would not even seek a market for the insular products.\r\n\r\n“Add to this lack of material inducement,” says Rizal, “the absence of\r\nmoral stimulus, and you will see how he who is not indolent in that\r\ncountry must needs be a madman or at least a fool.”\r\n\r\nThe injustice with which the native was treated everywhere, merely\r\nbecause of his birth and his color, atrophied his energies; such were\r\nthe windings and curlings of the vile snake of racial antipathy. Let\r\nthe Filipino with whatsoever effort achieve whatsoever prize in fair\r\ncompetition with a white man, and the wreath he had won by worth would\r\nbe snatched from him by trickery or plain theft. Why, then, should he\r\nstrive?\r\n\r\nBut still worse were the evils of what was called by way of euphony the\r\neducational system maintained under this dispensation.\r\n\r\nTake the best of these schools, or so-called schools, and at their\r\nbest. “They amount,” says Rizal, “to five or ten years each of 150 days\r\nat most, in which the youth comes in contact with those very priests\r\nthat boldly proclaim that it is an evil for the natives to know\r\nCastilian [Spanish], that the native should not be separated from his\r\ncarabao, [139] that he should not have any further aspirations, and so\r\non; five to ten years in which the majority of the students have\r\ngrasped nothing more than that no one understands what the books say,\r\nnot even the professors themselves, perhaps; and these five to ten\r\nyears have to offset the daily preachment of the whole life, that\r\npreachment which lowers the dignity of man, which by degrees brutally\r\ndeprives him of the sentiment of self-esteem, that eternal, stubborn,\r\nconstant labor to bow the native’s neck, to make him accept the yoke,\r\nto place him on a level with the beast.\r\n\r\n“Deprive a man, then, of his dignity, and you not only deprive him of\r\nhis moral strength but you also make him useless even for those that\r\nwish to make use of him. Every creature has its stimulus, its\r\nmain-spring. Man’s is his self-esteem. Take it away from him and he is\r\na corpse, and he that seeks activity in a corpse will encounter only\r\nworms.” [140]\r\n\r\nFinally there was the paralysis laid upon the Filipino because he was\r\ndivested of the infinite sustaining and guiding strength of a national\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nWithout this no people can realize the good that is potential within\r\nthem, no people can ever attain to the self-expression that is their\r\ndue, and no people will ever manifest their normal activities. “A man\r\nin the Philippines is only an individual—he is not a member of a\r\nnation. He is forbidden and denied the right of association, and is\r\ntherefore weak and sluggish. The Philippines is an organism whose cells\r\nseem to have no arterial system to irrigate it or nervous system to\r\ncommunicate its impressions.... The result of this is that if a\r\nprejudicial measure is ordered, no one protests: all goes well\r\napparently until later the evils are felt. Another blood-letting and as\r\nthe organism has neither nerves nor voice the physician proceeds in the\r\nbelief that the treatment is not injuring it. It needs a reform, but as\r\nit must not speak, it keeps silent and remains with the need.” [141]\r\n\r\nThus of the possible contribution of these people the world was\r\ndeprived because a grotesquely unintelligent tyranny stifled the\r\nexpression of their natural forces. It is the office of absolutism to\r\ntry to make men think alike. This absolutism tried to keep them from\r\nthinking at all.\r\n\r\nOnce the Filipino was active, alert, industrious, prosperous. Now he\r\nhad become inert, often inept, indifferent, poor. For these\r\ntransformations, behold here the reasons. They are enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith more than one purpose we have dwelt at length upon this remarkable\r\ntreatise. It shows Rizal’s mind, how clear and strong, and his\r\nthinking, how firm and sure. It shows how logically he arranged his\r\nideas to a climax, a faculty that marks all his writings. It shows how\r\nwell based upon reading and reason, no less than upon observation, was\r\nhis faith in the Filipino people. Not from mere instinct nor from\r\nracial prejudice, he felt that here was a great and suppressed power.\r\nWe dwell upon it also because it offers an unequaled picture of the\r\nPhilippines after three hundred years of alien rule and indicates the\r\nappalling boundaries of the task that he had single-handed undertaken.\r\nCourage is the quality that mankind has elected most to honor. Surely\r\nthe courage of battle-fields is little compared with the supreme\r\ncourage of a man that looking level-eyed upon such terrific\r\ndifficulties as are outlined here sets himself to the one business of\r\ncombating and overcoming them.\r\n\r\nOne other reflection pertains to this chapter, profoundly suggestive to\r\nany mind that will give heed to it. After all these generations of a\r\nsystem so elaborately designed to annihilate their spirits and\r\nchloroform their energies, the Malays of the Islands were still\r\nunerased. A few years after Rizal’s so able plea for them had been\r\nwritten they were in arms beating back the best troops of the\r\noppressor. Thirty years later, under changed auspices, they were giving\r\nto the world a conspicuous example of intelligent and successful\r\nself-government. No sooner was applied to them the stimulus of a\r\nmeasure of freedom than the old reproach of indolence began to fail.\r\n\r\nIn thirty years they had demonstrated the truth of all this man had\r\nsaid of them. Sympathetic insight proved to be better than the solemn\r\nplatitudes of wise men reasoning backward. As you see the Filipino now,\r\nsaid the wise men, so he must be always. Indolence—it is of the race\r\nand incurable! With a dash of his pen Rizal sent all this seven ways.\r\nHe knew the heart of Filipinas; the wise men knew only what had been\r\nwritten by somebody who had read what somebody else had deduced about\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWHAT MANNER OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than the persecutions launched against his family disturbed Rizal\r\nin the news he was receiving now from Manila. The fire of discontent\r\nwas rising among the people of the Philippines; the letters of his\r\nfriends foreshadowed an explosion. Not revolution by peaceful means was\r\nat hand but another civil war. He determined to go to Madrid that he\r\nmight talk with the Filipinos there about these storm-signals and at\r\nthe same time lodge with the Spanish Government a formal protest\r\nagainst the eviction of the family from its Calamba property.\r\n\r\nAt Madrid he found the situation much changed in the five years of his\r\nabsence. In the Filipino colony the feeling had gained that from such a\r\nGovernment nothing was to be won by appeals and agitation. For an\r\nillustration men pointed to Cuba. Petitions, reasonings, arguments,\r\nbeseechings wrought nothing. Whatever Cuba had gained was tribute to\r\nits sword. Against this Rizal still counseled. Even in such a crisis he\r\ncould not rid his mind of the doctrine of fitness for self-government,\r\nand so long as he reasoned more than he allowed himself to feel, he\r\ncould not compromise with his overmastering horror of war.\r\n\r\nIn this, again, he had outstripped the current thought of his age. A\r\nworld without war was then the dream of a few enthusiasts, looking to\r\nanother generation or to some mystic transformation in the chemistry of\r\nhuman blood; what were called practical men went on devising new\r\ntorpedoes and more powerful explosives for the next conflict. In his\r\nown way, different from theirs, he was himself as truly a practical man\r\nas ever lived, and a warless humanity was no dream to him; he thought\r\nhe could see it close at hand. He thought he could see his fellow-men\r\nof all lands surrendering the lunacy of combat for a rational\r\nsettlement of international troubles by agreement and arbitration. Out\r\nof the reflexes of his own thought and spirit he was instructed that\r\nthe hour for this transformation had come.\r\n\r\nUp to that time, certainly, the lessons of history, his favorite study,\r\nwere against him. There can be no doubt that a condition of oppression\r\nor general injustice is in essence a condition of violence, and so far\r\nin the human story half-emancipated man has found no way to end one\r\ncondition of violence except by means of another. “It will have blood,\r\nthey say, blood will have blood,” might have been written across the\r\ngates of every house of tyranny. The hope that the frightful wrongs\r\nlaid upon the Filipinos could be an exception to this primordial rule\r\nwas alluring to a soul like Rizal’s. We can see now that in the\r\nexisting stage of civilization it was no better founded than the other\r\ndeceptive notion that the sufferings of the common people of France\r\nunder the Ancient Régime could have had any result but retribution in\r\nkind. As a matter of strict fact, the Reign of Terror was established\r\nyears before Dr. Guillotin thought of his device of “a certain movable\r\nframework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history.” It was\r\nin reality assured by the fathers of many innocent and well meaning\r\nladies and gentlemen whose heads it rolled into the Seine—a painful\r\nthought, but historically indisputable. The fierce philosophy of these\r\nrecords Rizal could not assimilate; the poet in him revolted at the\r\nugliness of hatred; he had too genuine a love of his own kind to\r\ntolerate cruelty. Whether in the mass or toward individuals he could\r\nnot endure it. These seem to constitute the only set of facts his mind\r\nwas unable to absorb. He could in four weeks master a language and\r\ncould not in a lifetime well comprehend the caveman’s logic of blows.\r\n\r\nThis amiable strabismus half blinded him to what was really impending\r\nin his own country. The truth was that the System was slowly forcing a\r\nrevolt there; not intentionally, but after the manner of all drunken\r\npower. To lay bare the iniquities of that System was to send against it\r\nthe torch and ax. Every page of “Noli Me Tangere” was in effect a call\r\nto battle. He never suspected this, but fact it was nevertheless. To\r\nimagine, as he at one time imagined, that intrenched greed would\r\nwithout a struggle surrender its privileges and lay by the cracking of\r\nits whips was to imagine that which never was nor shall be. The\r\nreversion to primitive standards was inaugurated, not by Filipino\r\nrevolutionists, but by the System itself, which, denying justice, left\r\nto the harassed multitudes nothing but revolution.\r\n\r\nAt this crux of his story, when he appeared at Madrid as the champion\r\nof an impossible peace, and the eyes and hearts of all his countrymen\r\nwere turning to him, the time may be good to describe the man that had\r\nalready wielded so tremendous a power.\r\n\r\nHe was then in his thirty-first year. The first impression one had of\r\nhim was of wholesome vigor and physical well-being. He was of rather\r\nslender build, but all of muscle and sinew compact, for he never\r\nremitted his exercises. In height, he was five feet, four inches;\r\ncoming of what seems to Occidental eyes an undersized people. From long\r\nhours at his desk he had contracted a slight stoop. His handsome face\r\nretained its fine boyish oval, but rugged character and unshakable\r\nfirmness were now stamped upon it, and an expression of melancholy. His\r\neyes were still remarked for their brightness. His hands were small and\r\nshapely, his feet noticeably small. [142]\r\n\r\nHis voice was low in pitch, of a noble tonality, and so strangely\r\nvibrant that one hearing it at its best never forgot it. One of his\r\nrules was never to raise it; he spoke always with an identical\r\nrestraint. With such a voice and with his flow of apt and picturesque\r\nlanguage he was equipped for public speaking, in which he had made on\r\nseveral occasions a rather marked success; yet he always thought\r\nlightly of the art of oratory and refused to pursue it.\r\n\r\nWhether among his friends or in his writings he had ordinarily little\r\nto say about himself, and there is but one recorded instance when he\r\nseemed to give way to the bitter recollections that must at times have\r\nassailed him. On this occasion he said to a friend in London with whom\r\nhe was walking:\r\n\r\n“I have traveled around the world. I have studied the important nations\r\nby personal and direct observation. I have noted well all the races\r\nthat have contributed to human progress. I speak all their languages\r\nand others. And yet,” he added with a melancholy smile, “I am to the\r\nfriars merely a vulgar half-breed.”\r\n\r\nAt Madrid, one of his intimates from the Islands was Teodoro Sandiko,\r\nlater to be a leader among his people and an honored member of the\r\nPhilippine Senate. In a letter recalling their association, Senator\r\nSandiko once wrote: [143]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rizal was fond of physical exercise and so was I. We practised\r\n    fencing together and soon became good and close friends.\r\n\r\n    He was simple in his manners, but profound in his studies and\r\n    researches, analytical in his mental processes, reflective rather\r\n    than sentimental. He was extremely methodical and industrious; I\r\n    never saw him idle. He had great confidence in himself, was firm in\r\n    his faith, resourceful in the solving of a difficult situation,\r\n    swift and sure in his decisions. His habit was to answer without\r\n    hesitation and succinctly any question that might be put to him; he\r\n    had never to hunt for an idea or a word. He was the most loyal of\r\n    friends; anything he possessed was at his friend’s disposal. He was\r\n    courteous, affectionate, affable, sincere, but rather serious. His\r\n    mental state may be judged from the mass of material he contributed\r\n    to “La Solidaridad,” so varied, so forceful and so carefully\r\n    prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\nWherever he went, he seemed without effort to make friends of all men\r\nthat came near him. Set down in a steamer full of strangers, he would\r\nbe noted at once by every passenger and before dinner was served would\r\nbe on good terms with most of the persons on board, crew included. Yet,\r\nstrange to say, he seldom smiled, usually seemed distrait in the midst\r\nof others’ mirth, and was sometimes lost in gloomy musing, when he\r\nseemed all unaware of his surroundings. In the opinion of his friends,\r\nhe had almost no self-consciousness; certainly, all his life he hated\r\naffectations and never lost a chance to scorch them with his terrible\r\nsarcasm; for this man of the world, ordinarily so suave and courteous\r\nthat he won good will even among his enemies, had certain reserve funds\r\nof censuring speech he could make as bitter as gall. Whether he sat,\r\nwalked, stood, talked, or listened he was always natural, always\r\ncomposed, and always the sure master of himself. When he went through\r\nthe United States he noticed that the men there conversed without\r\ngesticulating, contrary to the practice of the Spaniards and most\r\nEuropeans. On reflection he deemed the practice to lend strength to\r\nutterance and thereafter made it a rule to keep his hands still while\r\nhe talked.\r\n\r\nThe image of a man that seldom smiled and yet so easily won his fellows\r\nto like him seems out of the drawing of nature and yet in this case is\r\nessentially true. There was in Rizal’s face something almost\r\nirresistibly winning. Good will looked out of it and warm human\r\nsympathy and a kind of downright sincerity that found a way to the\r\nnotice of even the dullest. It seemed to one studying him attentively\r\nthat on the original lines of a being all love, gentleness, and\r\nmeditation had been stamped later a great melancholy and a great and\r\nhigh resolve. Lowly men seemed to understand instinctively something in\r\nhim they could never have formulated nor described, something friendly\r\nand good; and men of learning turned with a similar impulse to a mind\r\nthat showed itself so wealthy and still so unpretending.\r\n\r\nHe loved music, was a good judge of it, and composed it readily and\r\nwell. He loved flowers as all other things beautiful—of course, being\r\nan artist born and the instinct ineradicable in him! That charming poem\r\nof his, “The Flowers of Heidelberg” [144] was written in the intervals\r\nbetween his pursuits of the most advanced discoveries and driest facts\r\nin ophthalmology, surgery, ethnology, entomology, anthropology, and the\r\npenning of some of the fiercest passages of condensed wrath to be found\r\nin any language. It is likely that he saw nothing grotesque in these\r\nabrupt transitions; perfectly sincere men have little time for such\r\nnice questionings. If we regard the making of poetry as the serious\r\nbusiness of his soul, which it was, his chief intellectual relaxation\r\nwas chess, of which, by the time of his second visit to Madrid, he had\r\nbecome a notable player. [145]\r\n\r\nHe had as little vanity as any man conscious of his powers could\r\nreasonably have. Yet he was always careful of his appearance and took\r\npains to dress well, after the most modest taste. Even when he was\r\npoverty-stricken in Berlin and living on a daily bowl of coffee and\r\npiece of bread, he would allow himself no laxity in his attire.\r\n\r\nOnce he wrote of some pupils of his that he was teaching them to behave\r\nlike men. [146] It was a point of weight with him. His conception of a\r\nman was one that had at all times himself in full command. This virtue\r\nhe had practised assiduously from those old days at the Ateneo when\r\nfirst he perceived its splendors; and now he was so truly captain of\r\nhis own soul that, as we have seen, he could endure privations, subdue\r\nappetites, and urge himself along his road by the sheer force of his\r\nwill. He was the greater part of his life desperately poor; yet if he\r\nhad been willing to practise his profession for gain a great fortune\r\nwas within his grasp. In whatsoever conditions he found himself he\r\nstill tried to adhere to that plan he had adopted at the Ateneo of\r\napportioning his day according to a schedule. He was more careful of\r\nhis time than a miser of his gold; he would waste no hour. To his\r\nfriends he admitted that when he sat silent in company and seemed to be\r\nmoody he was composing his next article for “La Solidaridad” or a new\r\nchapter in one of his books. He was the least superstitious of men, but\r\nfor years he had a presentiment that he would die by shooting. Once\r\ncrossing Bagumbayan Field he pointed to the place of execution and said\r\nto a companion, “On that spot I shall some day be put to death by a\r\nfiring-squad.” As a final light upon a singular character, it is to be\r\nnoted that he was not oppressed by this foreboding. It was accompanied\r\nin his mind, as nearly as one can discern, with a conviction that the\r\ncause for which he stood must have its victims, and to this extent and\r\nno farther showed in him the fatalism supposed to be a distinctive\r\ntrait of the Malay.\r\n\r\nHe was ordinarily so calm, so self-contained, so much the example of\r\nthe reasoning man and the like, that it seems highly incongruous to\r\nthink of him as a duelist; yet twice he challenged to mortal combat. It\r\nappears that under his coolly borne exterior there was fire, and even\r\nhis beautiful faith in the supremacy of reason had not eradicated all\r\nthe Old Adam from his blood. He seems never to have thought that the\r\nviolence he contemplated was nothing but a minute specimen of the\r\nwar-making he denounced, nor that in sending challenges he reverted\r\nfrom his most cherished doctrines. Perhaps if the inconsistency had\r\nbeen pointed out to him then it would not have disturbed him, and\r\ncertainly it is a hobgoblin that need not disturb us now. If the queer\r\nbundle of nerves that is called man never presented a greater\r\nirrelevancy, admiration for him need molt no feather. Both of the\r\nquarrels, if so they might be called, that brought out the fighting\r\ninstinct in the gentle artist-student resulted from incidents in Madrid\r\nwhen he returned there in 1890. W. E. Retana, who had been press-agent\r\nin Manila for the friars, was now a Madrid journalist and printed in\r\nhis newspaper a vicious and baseless attack upon Rizal wherein he\r\nsought, doubtless, to revenge the friars on the author of “Noli Me\r\nTangere.” Without delay Rizal sent him a challenge. Mr. Retana seems to\r\nhave had no appetite to go afield; he published a retraction and\r\napology and the quarrel ended. [147] Rather oddly, Retana, who had been\r\nin Manila the bitter foe of the Filipino cause and of all its champions\r\n(though possibly on a commercial basis), became, after this incident,\r\nfirst the friend and then the biographer of Rizal.\r\n\r\nThe other altercation was with Antonio Luna, [148] afterward a famous\r\ncommander in the army of the Philippine Republic. About a woman of\r\nRizal’s acquaintance Luna made an unworthy remark, and Rizal sent him a\r\nchallenge. Having possibly regained sobriety meanwhile, Luna withdrew\r\nthe remark and apologized for it, whereupon the quarrel was made up\r\nwithout mortal arbitrament. In his chivalrous and unsullied attitude\r\ntoward women Rizal was true to the finest traditions of his race. Among\r\nthe faults of the Filipinos, lechery is assuredly not included. Except\r\nthe Irish, no other people on earth have a higher conception of\r\nchastity and sex morality, nor adhere to it with greater tenacity.\r\nRetana wrote that Rizal had “a truly upright moral sense.” It was but\r\nan inadequate tribute. He was a champion of righteousness; his religion\r\nwas like Wendell Phillips’s, “a battle not a dream.” When he wrote,\r\n“The good of my country, that is all I pursue,” he was not making\r\nplatform epigrams but telling what the records confirm.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the purity of his conduct; at least as wonderful is\r\nthe fact that he left so little trace of a selfish aim. Other men with\r\ngreat work to do have had all of his indifference to wealth; what\r\nclassifies him as above all these is his far rarer indifference to the\r\nnobler ambitions for fame and power that have beset so many others in\r\nhis position and wrecked so many good causes. He sought no place,\r\nlooked for no honor, cared for applause as little as finite man could\r\nbe expected to care, seemed to have no yearning for ease nor for\r\npleasure. The lust of the eyes, and that fatal lure, the joy of warming\r\noneself in the sun of one’s own glory tripped him not. We may admit\r\nthat the balance to be drawn from these facts is not wholly a human\r\nfigure; one looks for the faults that have disfigured so many other\r\nnational heroes and the things that laurel-bearing biographers labor\r\ndeftly to conceal. There seems to be nothing to conceal about this man.\r\nAnd if the tale of his virtues seems at times overwrought so that we\r\nmight be relieved to find somewhere that he swore, was easily angered,\r\nor chewed tobacco or fought a cabman, we are to remember that as his\r\nideals bore him to unusual heights, so it was an unusual condition that\r\nforced him early in life to surrender every purpose but the\r\nemancipation of his country. And when we have made all allowances for\r\nthe power of this ambition that swept him along, the fact will remain\r\nand be inevitable in the records that here was a strange figure to walk\r\nin upon us in the nineteenth century from the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be noted a singular fact about that leadership of his\r\npeople, forced upon him as we have noted, and not of his designing or\r\nplotting. With his prestige and the popularity that was the certain\r\nconsequence of a success so gratifying to the hurt national pride, he\r\nhad but to make a gesture to his countrymen and they would have\r\nfollowed him over the smoking ruins of Malacañan or any other place,\r\nfighting with bolos if they could come by no rifles. It was a\r\ntemptation to dramatics on the world stage that few men could have\r\nresisted. What reality of stern virtue, worthier of a legendary age\r\nthan of his own times, was in this man may be gaged from the fact that\r\nhe not so much resisted the temptation as ignored it. Perhaps to him it\r\nwas no temptation; at least he may be thought of as living in his inner\r\nand real self, where such things weighed nothing. The time demanded\r\nfrom a revolutionary leader a proclamation and loud cheers; he met it\r\nwith a learned treatise on taxation and how taxation might be improved.\r\nBitter are the penalties that attend a dark skin! But for his\r\ncomplexion the world would class him with its purest and best, with\r\nWashington and William the Silent, Phocion and Brutus, Garrison and\r\nWendell Phillips, and the rest of the scanty band that, having great\r\ntasks thrust upon them, forgot themselves and their tenements of clay\r\nto think only of the Common Good.\r\n\r\nAs to how José Rizal would stand such a test applied to his career and\r\nall of it, take this testimony of Retana, who from antecedent\r\nprobability at least would invent no extravagance of praise. Even in\r\nhis youth, said Retana, every injustice, every crime, every wrong,\r\nstruck home to his sensibilities. He walked with unsmirched garments\r\nthrough a world filled with the reek of a sordid time and the cruelty\r\nthat man works upon man, trying to make a protest against all\r\noppressions and busy to the end with the troubles of his fellows but\r\nnot with his own.\r\n\r\nTo this sketch of his moral self, not less engaging than his physical\r\nportraiture, remains to be added one line. Pursued indefatigably by\r\nbigotry and prejudice, he was himself of a singular tolerance. The\r\nwrongs of his people he resented with towering indignation, and his own\r\nhe viewed with an astonishing calm. To the gibes and sneers and taunts\r\nof his foes he had but the one habitual response:\r\n\r\n               “To understand all is to forgive all!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n“EL FILIBUSTERISMO”\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Spanish or Filipino ears, “filibuster” has nothing of the comic or\r\ndisreputable suggestion that it bears to the American. In the\r\nPhilippines of Rizal’s day it denoted a person opposed to the existing\r\nrégime, an insurgent, whether advocating peaceful or violent means of\r\nseparation from Spain. “El Filibusterismo” means a movement for\r\nPhilippine independence.\r\n\r\nIn this novel again, the chief figure is Ibarra, the hero of “Noli Me\r\nTangere.” It was Elias, not Ibarra, that was struck with the bullets of\r\nthe Civil Guards when they were pursuing his banca; Ibarra escaped\r\nunhurt. He made his way out of the country and now returns after some\r\nyears, disguised and under an assumed name, to seek the revenge upon\r\nwhich all this time his heart has been brooding. The difference between\r\nthe Ibarra that refused Elias’ prayer to lead the people and this\r\nIbarra become now hopeless of any peaceful remedy betrays once more the\r\nchange we have already noted as coming over Rizal’s most cherished\r\nconvictions and in spite of himself. A struggle was going on between\r\nwhat he still wished to believe and what his judgment told him was\r\ninevitable, and in the conflict he grew in hardihood. From the savage\r\nvengeance that pursued his sisters, brothers, father, and mother when\r\nit had failed to reach him, he was beginning to learn how idle was the\r\nhope to win reform by merely ladylike appeals. Yet the book was not of\r\npurpose any signal to popular revolt. What he intended was solemn\r\nwarning. So far the Filipino has stood and asked for justice, still\r\npatient, still holding out the friendly hand. Wronged hearts will not\r\nalways accept scurvy affronts; men will not always put up with kicks\r\nwhen they ask fair play. This Filipino whom you despise and trample on\r\nnineteen years in twenty and who, in the twentieth, throws you into a\r\npanic, is not the human dish-cloth you are pleased now to imagine him.\r\nHe has in him the capacity for a great and memorable revenge, and upon\r\nyour heads he will pull down your structure if you do not hear him.\r\n\r\nOther characters of the first book reappear in this. Father Salvi, the\r\nlascivious friar whose machinations brought about Ibarra’s downfall;\r\nCapitán Tiago, Doña Victorina, and Basilio, the son of Sisa. Ibarra\r\ncalls himself Mr. Simoun. His pretended business is that of a traveling\r\nmerchant of jewelry and laces; his real occupation is to spy out the\r\nland, to lay plots against the governing class that ruined him, and, if\r\npossible, to release Maria Clara from her convent prison. The narrative\r\nis chiefly concerned with these plots and their failure; but behind\r\nthem always seems to show a grim figure telling Government that such\r\nplots will not always fail.\r\n\r\nThe book starts with a gibe at the people with whose tardiness to\r\nrespond to progressive ideas Rizal was becoming impatient.\r\n\r\n\r\n    One morning in December the steamer Tabo was laboriously ascending\r\n    the tortuous course of the Pasig, carrying a large crowd of\r\n    passengers toward the province of La Laguna. She was a heavily\r\n    built steamer, almost round, like the taboo from which she derived\r\n    her name, quite dirty in spite of her pretentious whiteness,\r\n    majestic and grave from her leisurely motion. Altogether, she was\r\n    held in great affection in that region, perhaps from her Tagalog\r\n    name, or from the fact that she bore the characteristic impress of\r\n    things in the country, representing something like a triumph over\r\n    progress, a steamer that was not a steamer at all, an organism,\r\n    stolid, imperfect, yet unimpeachable, which, when it wished to pose\r\n    as being rankly progressive, proudly contented itself with putting\r\n    on a fresh coat of paint. Indeed, the happy steamer was genuinely\r\n    Filipino! If a person were only reasonably considerate, she might\r\n    have been taken for the Ship of State, constructed, as she had\r\n    been, under the inspection of Reverendos and Ilustrísimos.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs before, Rizal uses with photographic accuracy the materials of\r\nPhilippine life that had passed under his own observation. The\r\nwanderings of Simoun the jeweler give him the needed occasions; he\r\nhangs upon them startling pictures of actual conditions, the power of\r\nthe friars, the brutality and cowardice of the governing class, the\r\nterrible wrongs of the people; even the story of Maria Clara’s\r\nparentage he had from an incident in his own neighborhood. Poverty,\r\nchastity, [149] and obedience were the oath of the degenerate\r\nsuccessors to a noble race of Christianity’s pioneers. How lightly they\r\nregarded the second item in this creed he had shown in “Noli Me\r\nTangere.” As to poverty, their corporations had become the wealthiest\r\ninstitutions in the Islands. He is now about to show how they had\r\nobtained the wealth that made their power supreme and pervasive.\r\n\r\nTandang Selo is a native wood-cutter that by industry and self-denial\r\nhas saved a little money. He has a son, Tales, industrious and thrifty\r\nlike himself. Tales works for a rich landowner and saves enough to buy\r\ntwo carabaos, to marry, and to accumulate a capital of several hundred\r\npesos. He has ambition; he wishes to rise in the world. There is the\r\njungle, unclaimed, untilled, but fertile. With his father, his wife,\r\nand children he goes into it, clears away the forest, and makes\r\ntillable fields.\r\n\r\nTo cut for the first time the jungle turf is supposed to release a\r\ndangerous malaria. Of this, Tales’s wife and eldest child fall ill and\r\ndie. The others continue to plant and to cultivate.\r\n\r\nAs they begin to harvest the first crop, an agent of the friars\r\nappears, notifies them that the land belongs to one of the orders, and\r\nlevies on the crop for the rent.\r\n\r\nTales has every reason to believe that the claim is fraudulent, but he\r\nis only an Indio; the courts are organized against him and his people,\r\nand he pays tribute rather than risk a lawsuit.\r\n\r\nThe next year the crops are good and the friars double the rent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the family works hard and saves a little money. The desire\r\nof the father’s heart is to send his eldest daughter, Juli, to school\r\nin Manila. Next year the rent is again increased, and the hope of\r\neducation begins to fail.\r\n\r\nWhen the rent has risen from thirty to two hundred pesos, Tales refuses\r\nto pay the latest increase. Then the friars’ agent tells him to prepare\r\nto be evicted, for another tenant will come and till the fields Tales\r\nhas won from the jungle.\r\n\r\nTales applies to the courts for relief and is at once despoiled of his\r\nsavings to pay the fees; likewise to satisfy the cormorants that batten\r\nupon every court proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe farm is exposed to the raids of the tulisanes, or robbers. The\r\ninvisible government has energy enough to play eavesdropper upon its\r\nown people, but makes scarcely an effort to restrain the banditti that\r\nhover in all the forests and often descend upon the towns, even large\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nTo protect his fields from these vultures, Tales patrols them with a\r\nshot-gun and so terrifies the friars’ agents and the new tenant that\r\nthe benevolent intention of turning him into the road must be abandoned\r\nuntil the lawsuit shall be decided.\r\n\r\nUnder the code his case is unassailable. Even by their own charter the\r\nfriars cannot own land. The judges know that this is so, but one of\r\ntheir number loses his place for giving a decision in favor of a\r\nnative; the rest have no desire to share his fate and so to go back to\r\nSpain humiliated as well as impoverished. They advise Tales to\r\nsurrender and pay what is demanded of him. The fighting blood of the\r\nMalay is up within him: he stands in his place and demands that the\r\nfriars produce some evidence of ownership—title-deeds, documents,\r\npapers, anything. None of these have the friars to show; their claim\r\nhere, as so often in such cases, rests upon the tradition of a\r\nconcession. Nowhere else would such a plea, unsupported and\r\nunwitnessed, be seriously considered in a court of justice. In the\r\nPhilippines it outweighs everything else, and the judges decide in\r\nfavor of the friars.\r\n\r\nTales with his gun continues to patrol his land. The friars obtain a\r\ndecree from the governor-general ordering all arms to be surrendered,\r\nand so they take away the shot-gun. Tales patrols his fields with a\r\nbolo.\r\n\r\nThe bolo is taken from him on the pretext that it is too long and\r\ntherefore comes within the prohibition of the decree about arms. Tales\r\npatrols his fields with an ax.\r\n\r\nThen the tulisanes come and capture him and hold him for five hundred\r\npesos ransom.\r\n\r\nTo get the money, Juli sells herself into slavery in the neighboring\r\ntown. It is not called by that name, her servitude; but that is what it\r\namounts to.\r\n\r\nShe is engaged to a young man whom she dearly loves. The sale of\r\nherself is likely to end her chance of marriage.\r\n\r\nWith the money so raised, her father is ransomed. He comes home to find\r\nthe friars’ agent and the new tenant walking over the fields that with\r\nso much labor the Tales family has cleared.\r\n\r\nTales steals a revolver and joins the tulisanes. That night the friars’\r\nagent and the new tenant and the new tenant’s wife are murdered. [150]\r\n\r\nThe substance of this story, as you perceive, is taken from the\r\nexperiences of the tenants of Calamba, among them Rizal’s own folk.\r\n\r\nThere is terrible irony in a description of how the governor-general\r\ngoverns; how he transacts business and promotes the welfare of the\r\nIslands. He has been on a hunting expedition in which he has shot\r\nnothing and returns ill tempered to Los Baños, where he has his bath,\r\ndrinks his cocoanut milk, and sits down to a game of cards with three\r\nfriars. From this reasonable occupation his chief secretary tries to\r\ndivert his attention to matters of public business. This annoys the\r\ngovernor-general.\r\n\r\n“The petition about sporting arms,” suggests the secretary.\r\n\r\n“Forbidden!” says the governor-general and goes on playing. The\r\nsecretary tries to intimate that this is not wise. He only arouses the\r\nwrath of the executive.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster at Tiani has petitioned for a better location for his\r\nschool. The old store-room he is using has no roof: he has bought with\r\nhis own funds books and pictures, and he wishes them not to be ruined.\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard several complaints against this schoolmaster,” says his\r\nExcellency. “I think the best thing would be to suspend him.”\r\n\r\n“Suspended!” [151] says the secretary.\r\n\r\n“In the future,” says the governor-general, “all that complain will be\r\nsuspended.”\r\n\r\nThe well known fact is developed that there are not nearly enough\r\nschool-houses. Somebody suggests that the cockpits might be used for\r\nschools when not needed for the more exalted purpose to which they are\r\ndedicated. Horror meets the proposal to interfere, for the sake of mere\r\neducation, with reasonable sport and with the Government’s revenue.\r\n\r\nIt is probably the worst Government in the world.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the card game the secretary whispers to his Excellency\r\nthat that woman is around again, the daughter of Cabesang Tales, with\r\nher petition. When Tales fled to the tulisanes the authorities, true to\r\nform, arrested his aged father in his stead and now hold him in prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n    His Excellency looked at him with an expression of impatience and\r\n    rubbed his hand across his broad forehead. “Carambas! Can’t one be\r\n    left to eat one’s breakfast in peace?”\r\n\r\n    “This is the third day she has come. She’s a poor girl——”\r\n\r\n    The governor-general scratched the back of his ear and said, “Oh,\r\n    go along! Have the secretary make out an order to the lieutenant of\r\n    the Civil Guard for the old man’s release. They sha’n’t say that\r\n    we’re not clement and merciful.”\r\n\r\n    He looked at Ben-Zayb. The journalist winked. [152]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can see that it is cartoon-making with a vengeance. The mirth is\r\nsavage. It gives one the shivers. This man taught the methods of peace\r\nand rejected every suggestion that reform could be won by physical\r\nviolence. Yet the way he was walking is clear. In ten years if he had\r\nkept on he would himself have been leading an insurrection. It has\r\nalways been so; in the cloister the sweet gentle spirit dreaming of\r\noppression overcome by reason, and in the streets rude weapons beating\r\noff the shackles.\r\n\r\nAs Simoun the jeweler, Ibarra brings dramatic vengeance upon the head\r\nof Father Salvi. In Manila is an American prestidigitator who is\r\nexhibiting the trick known as the talking head. In this instance the\r\nhead is supposed to be that of an ancient Egyptian. In the midst of\r\ngruesome settings to enhance the effect, it tells to an audience in\r\nwhich Salvi is seated the story of Maria Clara, disguised as an event\r\nof four thousand years ago. Salvi, conscience-stricken, falls in a fit.\r\n[153]\r\n\r\nSimoun’s purpose from the beginning has been to excite the people to an\r\nuprising by which he hopes to win his revenge on friars and Government\r\nalike and to free Maria Clara from the nunnery where she has been\r\nvirtually a prisoner since Ibarra’s arrest, as told in “Noli Me\r\nTangere.” The actual situation in the Islands is illuminated by\r\npicturing Simoun as telling some persons that the insurrection is\r\ndesired by the governor-general to free himself from the friars, and\r\ntelling others that the friars are planning it to rid themselves of the\r\ngovernor-general. In the chaos through which the social order was\r\ndrifting, either story was plausible. Simoun in his ceaseless\r\nintriguing has manœuvered within his power Quiroga, an influential\r\nChinaman, also a type in those days, who has secret and unseemly\r\ndealings with the Government. Through this connection Simoun is able to\r\nhave his rifles passed through the custom-house as some of Quiroga’s\r\nillicit importations. He spreads his nets and lays his plans, tutors\r\nhis accomplices, distributes his arms, and when all is ready for his\r\nexplosion he is stunned with the news that so far as Maria Clara is\r\nconcerned it is too late. She is dead in the convent.\r\n\r\nThere are two other love-stories in the book, both unhappy, both\r\nreflexes of Rizal’s own great unhappiness.\r\n\r\nOne is of Basilio and Juli. Basilio is the son of Sisa, the native\r\nwoman in “Noli Me Tangere,” driven insane by misfortunes and\r\npersecutions; Juli is the daughter of Cabesang Tales, driven into\r\nbrigandage by the exactions of the friars.\r\n\r\nSo slight a thing as a frolic of students brings Basilio and Juli to\r\ntheir tragedy. Some of the students have a supper. It is innocent and\r\ninsignificant, but the spies watch it. That night pasquinades are\r\npasted upon the doors of the university, pasquinades that the nervous\r\nauthorities deem seditious. To overwrought minds the bad verses and\r\ncheap jocularity of these compositions indicate that the treason must\r\nbe connected with the students’ supper. Therefore, arrest all the\r\nstudents. The order includes Basilio, who had not attended the fiesta,\r\nand whose rooms when searched yield nothing but text-books on medicine.\r\n\r\nIn the rural region where Juli is living, terrible reports are current\r\nas to the fate of these students. At one moment they are condemned to\r\nbe shot; at another the sentence has already been carried out. Then\r\ncomes news that with the help of influential and wealthy relatives they\r\nhope to escape the death-penalty; all except Basilio, who has no\r\nwealthy friends nor influence of any kind.\r\n\r\nThere is in the town where Juli lives a friar, Father Camorra, of great\r\npower in the Government. An old woman urges Juli to go to the convento\r\n[154] and beg the intercession of Father Camorra. A word from him will\r\nbe enough to save Basilio’s life. Juli knows well enough what is the\r\nreal nature of the sacrifice demanded of her; so many a Filipino girl\r\nhas walked or been dragged along that road to destruction. The reports\r\nabout the students grow worse. At last it appears that Basilio has been\r\ncondemned to death and in twenty-four hours will stand before the\r\nfiring-squad. Not a hope remains except through the intercession of\r\nFather Camorra. The old woman beseeches; still Juli refuses. At last\r\nshe is forced to the door of the convento. That night a woman,\r\nscreaming wildly, throws herself from an upper window of the house.\r\nWhen help comes to her she is dead. The body is recognized as that of\r\nJuli. [155]\r\n\r\nBasilio escapes the executioner. When he learns of the fate of Juli he\r\njoins Simoun, the disguised Ibarra, who has tried in vain to interest\r\nhim in the plans for a revolution.\r\n\r\nThe other story concerns Isagani, type of the educated and ambitious\r\nyoung Filipino, and Paulita, type of the exquisite native beauty.\r\nIsagani is deeply in love. Nevertheless, he puts fidelity to his\r\ncountry above even the idol of his heart. He is a leader among the\r\ndiscontented students. They do not think of sedition but only of\r\nreforms peacefully achieved, the Rizal idea of progress. An opportunity\r\narising, Isagani speaks with the greatest frankness to Father\r\nFernandez, a Dominican friar, and one of the instructors at the\r\nuniversity. Their conversation gives the author a chance to expose the\r\ndefects in the system of higher education—so called. He does more than\r\nexpose it; he blasts and withers it. [156] Isagani never hesitates to\r\nspeak his opinions about these things, though always professing perfect\r\nloyalty. He is arrested with the other students in the dog-day fit that\r\nhas seized upon the authorities. At the news the relatives of Paulita\r\ninsist that she shall cast over a lover so notorious and so dangerous.\r\nIt is Rizal and Leonora again. Paulita yields to them; she allows\r\nherself to be engaged to Isagani’s rival and the date is fixed for her\r\nwedding. It is the date that Simoun selects for the consummation of his\r\nplot. Basilio agrees to help him.\r\n\r\nPaulita’s relatives are rich; they have invited the most eminent\r\npersons in the colony, including the governor-general himself. Simoun,\r\nthe wealthy jeweler, will be there. He has arranged with bands of\r\ntulisanes and certain discontented peasants to gather on that date to\r\nattack the city. An explosion like the firing of a cannon is to be\r\ntheir signal.\r\n\r\nThe guests come bearing or sending beautiful gifts. Simoun presents a\r\nlamp of strange and beautiful design—burning. In it is a charge of\r\ndynamite sufficient to blow up the house and all in it. This will\r\nfurnish the signal for the attack. He has told this to Basilio. Outside\r\nthe house of festival, Isagani lingers, hoping to catch one farewell\r\nglimpse of the sweetheart he has lost. Basilio sees him and tries to\r\nlead him away before the explosion. Isagani refuses to move. In despair\r\nBasilio tells him what is afoot about the lamp. Isagani, overwhelmed\r\nwith horror at the thought that the woman he loves is about to perish,\r\nruns into the house, seizes the lighted lamp, throws it into the river,\r\nand follows it there before any one has a chance to stop him. [157]\r\n\r\nGreat excitement follows, in which something of the plot is revealed;\r\nand Simoun is unmasked, but not until he has had a chance to escape. He\r\nis pursued and wounded. He dies in the house of a Filipino family where\r\nhe has found refuge. On his death-bed he confesses to a priest his real\r\nname and story. [158]\r\n\r\n“God will forgive you, Señor Simoun,” says the priest. “He knows that\r\nwe are fallible. He has seen that you have suffered, and in ordaining\r\nthat the chastisement of your faults should come as death from the very\r\nones you have instigated to crime, we can see His infinite mercy. He\r\nhas frustrated your plans one by one, the best conceived, first by the\r\ndeath of Maria Clara, then by a lack of preparation, then in some\r\nmysterious way. Let us bow to His will and render Him thanks!”\r\n\r\n\r\n    “According to you, then,” feebly responded the sick man, “His will\r\n    is that these Islands——”\r\n\r\n    “Should continue in the condition in which they suffer?” continued\r\n    the priest, seeing that the other hesitated. “I don’t know, sir, I\r\n    can’t read the thought of the Inscrutable. I know that he has not\r\n    abandoned those peoples who in their supreme moments have trusted\r\n    in Him and made Him the judge of their cause. I know His arm has\r\n    never failed when, justice long trampled upon and every recourse\r\n    gone, the oppressed have taken up the sword to fight for home and\r\n    wife and children, for their inalienable rights, which, as the\r\n    German poet says, shine ever there above, unextinguished and\r\n    inextinguishable, like the eternal stars themselves. No, God is\r\n    justice; He cannot abandon His cause, the cause of liberty, without\r\n    which no justice is possible.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing could be plainer: Rizal is enforcing with a final warning the\r\nlesson of his book.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Why, then, has He denied me His aid?” asked the sick man in a\r\n    voice charged with bitter complaint.\r\n\r\n    “Because you chose means that He could not sanction,” was the\r\n    severe reply. “The glory of saving a country is not for him that\r\n    has contributed to its ruin. You have believed that what crime and\r\n    iniquity have defiled and deformed another crime and another\r\n    iniquity can purify and redeem. Wrong! Hate never produces anything\r\n    but monsters; crime never produces anything but criminals. Love\r\n    alone realizes wonderful works; virtue alone can save! No, if our\r\n    country is ever to be free it will not be through vice and crime;\r\n    it will not be so by corrupting its sons, deceiving some and\r\n    bribing others; no! Redemption presupposes virtue, virtue\r\n    sacrifice, and sacrifice love!”\r\n\r\n    “Well, I accept your explanation,” rejoined the sick man, after a\r\n    pause. “I have been mistaken, but, because I have been mistaken,\r\n    will that God deny liberty to a people and yet save many who are\r\n    much worse criminals than I am? What is my mistake compared to the\r\n    crimes of our rulers? Why has that God to give more heed to my\r\n    iniquity than to the cries of so many innocents? Why has He not\r\n    stricken me down and then made the people triumph? Why does He let\r\n    so many worthy and just ones suffer and look complacently upon\r\n    their tortures?”\r\n\r\n    “The just and the worthy must suffer in order that their ideas may\r\n    be known and extended! You must shake or shatter the vase to spread\r\n    its perfume; you must smite the rock to get the spark! There is\r\n    something providential in the persecutions of tyrants, Señor\r\n    Simoun!”\r\n\r\n    “I knew it,” murmured the sick man, “and therefore I encouraged the\r\n    tyranny.”\r\n\r\n    “Yes, my friend, but more corrupt influences than anything else\r\n    were spread. You fostered the social rottenness without sowing an\r\n    idea. From this fermentation of vices loathing alone could spring,\r\n    and if anything were born overnight it would be at best a mushroom,\r\n    for mushrooms only can spring spontaneously from filth. True it is\r\n    that the vices of the government are fatal to it; they cause its\r\n    death, but they kill also the society in whose bosom they are\r\n    developed. An immoral government presupposes a demoralized people,\r\n    a conscienceless administration, greedy and servile citizens in the\r\n    settled parts, outlaws and brigands in the mountains. Like master,\r\n    like slave! Like government, like country!”\r\n\r\n    A brief pause ensued, broken at length by the sick man’s voice.\r\n    “Then, what can be done?”\r\n\r\n    “Suffer and work!”\r\n\r\n    “Suffer—work!” echoed the sick man bitterly. “Ah, it’s easy to say\r\n    that, when you are not suffering, when the work is rewarded. If\r\n    your God demands such sacrifices from man, man who can scarcely\r\n    count upon the present and doubts the future, if you had seen what\r\n    I have, the miserable, the wretched, suffering unspeakable tortures\r\n    for crimes they have not committed, murdered to cover up the faults\r\n    and incapacity of others, poor fathers of families torn from their\r\n    homes to work to no purpose upon highways that are destroyed each\r\n    day and seem only to serve for sinking families into want. Ah, to\r\n    suffer, to work, is the will of God! Convince them that their\r\n    murder is their salvation, that their work is the prosperity of the\r\n    home! To suffer, to work! What God is that?”\r\n\r\n    “A very just God, Señor Simoun,” replied the priest. “A God who\r\n    chastises our lack of faith, our vices, the little esteem in which\r\n    we hold dignity and the civic virtues. We tolerate vice, we make\r\n    ourselves its accomplices, at times we applaud it; and it is just,\r\n    very just that we suffer the consequences, that our children suffer\r\n    them. It is the God of liberty, Señor Simoun, who obliges us to\r\n    love it, by making the yoke heavy for us—a God of mercy, of equity,\r\n    who while He chastises us betters us and only grants prosperity to\r\n    him who has merited it through his efforts. The school of suffering\r\n    tempers, the arena of combat strengthens the soul.\r\n\r\n    “I do not mean to say that our liberty will be secured at the\r\n    sword’s point, for the sword plays but little part in modern\r\n    affairs, but that we must secure it by making ourselves worthy of\r\n    it, by exalting the intelligence and the dignity of the individual,\r\n    by loving justice, right, and greatness, even to the extent of\r\n    dying for them; and when a people reaches that height God will\r\n    provide a weapon, the idols will be shattered, the tyranny will\r\n    crumble like a house of cards, and liberty will shine out like the\r\n    first dawn.\r\n\r\n    “Our ills we owe to ourselves alone, so let us blame no one. If\r\n    Spain should see that we were less complaisant with tyranny and\r\n    more disposed to struggle and suffer for our rights, Spain would be\r\n    the first to grant us liberty, because when the fruit of the womb\r\n    reaches maturity woe unto the mother who would stifle it! So, while\r\n    the Filipino people has not sufficient energy to proclaim, with\r\n    head erect and bosom bared its rights to social life, and to\r\n    guarantee it with its sacrifices, with its own blood; while we see\r\n    our countrymen in private life ashamed within themselves, hear the\r\n    voice of conscience roar in rebellion and protest, yet in public\r\n    life keep silence or even echo the words of him who abuses them in\r\n    order to mock the abused; while we see them wrap themselves up in\r\n    their egotism and with a forced smile praise the most iniquitous\r\n    actions, begging with their eyes a portion of the booty—why grant\r\n    them liberty? With Spain or without Spain they would always be the\r\n    same, and perhaps worse! Why independence, if the slaves of to-day\r\n    will be the tyrants of to-morrow? And that they will be such is not\r\n    to be doubted, for he who submits to tyranny loves it.\r\n\r\n    “Señor Simoun, when our people is unprepared, when it enters the\r\n    fight through fraud and force, without a clear understanding of\r\n    what it is doing, the wisest attempts will fail, and better that\r\n    they do fail, since why commit the wife to the husband if he does\r\n    not sufficiently love her, if he is not ready to die for her?”\r\n\r\n    Padre Florentino felt the sick man catch and press his hand; so he\r\n    became silent, hoping that the other might speak, but he merely\r\n    felt a stronger pressure of the hand, heard a sigh, and then\r\n    profound silence reigned in the room. Only the sea, whose waves\r\n    were rippled by the night breeze, as though awaking from the heat\r\n    of the day, sent its hoarse roar, its eternal chant, as it rolled\r\n    against the jagged rocks. The moon, now free from the sun’s\r\n    rivalry, peacefully commanded the sky, and the trees of the forest\r\n    bent down toward one another, telling their ancient legends in\r\n    mysterious murmurs borne on the wings of the wind.\r\n\r\n    The sick man said nothing; so Padre Florentino, deeply thoughtful,\r\n    murmured: “Where are the youth who will consecrate their golden\r\n    hours, their illusions, and their enthusiasm to the welfare of\r\n    their native land? Where are the youth who will generously pour out\r\n    their blood to wash away so much shame, so much crime, so much\r\n    abomination? Pure and spotless must the victim be that the\r\n    sacrifice may be acceptable! Where are you, youth, who will embody\r\n    in yourselves the vigor of life that has left our veins, the purity\r\n    of ideas that has been contaminated in our brains, the fire of\r\n    enthusiasm that has been quenched in our hearts? We await you, O\r\n    youth! Come, for we await you!”\r\n\r\n    Feeling his eyes moisten, he withdrew his hand from that of the\r\n    sick man, arose, and went to the window to gaze out upon the wide\r\n    surface of the sea. He was drawn from his meditation by gentle raps\r\n    at the door. It was the servant asking if he should bring a light.\r\n\r\n    When the priest returned to the sick man and looked at him in the\r\n    light of the lamp, motionless, his eyes closed, the hand that had\r\n    pressed his lying open and extended along the edge of the bed, he\r\n    thought for a moment that he was sleeping, but noticing that he was\r\n    not breathing touched him gently, and then realized that he was\r\n    dead. His body had already commenced to turn cold. The priest fell\r\n    upon his knees and prayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Ibarra dies with his revenge unaccomplished, and the priest takes\r\nthe box in which the dead man’s great wealth is supposed to be\r\ncontained and without opening it throws it into the sea.\r\n\r\nOnly an artist would have thought of such an ending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE SAFE-CONDUCT\r\n\r\n\r\nFailure was all he reaped at Madrid in his efforts to win some measure\r\nof justice for his family, a fact that hardly could have astonished him\r\nthen and seems but normal now. In the seats of authority was no man\r\nthat loved justice so much as he feared the huge political machine set\r\nup by the friars and administered (through particularly appropriate\r\nselection) by the ruffian Weyler. Early in 1891, Rizal returned to\r\nParis, where he revisited his former friends, and so passed to Ghent.\r\nThere he settled himself to the finishing of “El Filibusterismo” and\r\nworked without further interruption until the book was done and on its\r\nway to the publisher.\r\n\r\nPowerful influences now seemed to draw him again to the East; it is\r\nlikely that but for his book he would have gone thither direct from\r\nMadrid when he learned how little help he might expect from the gross\r\nand inert government. The situation of his family caused him a\r\nharrowing anxiety. [159] It was for his sake that they were subjected\r\nto the abominable persecutions of the petty tyrants of the existing\r\nSystem. His soul revolted at the idea that they should be thus\r\ntormented while he was safely out of the range of his enemies’ venom.\r\nAfter his consultations with the Filipinos in Madrid the gloomy outlook\r\nin the Philippines was more than before a burden on his thought. He\r\nmust have known that this time, as he had forecasted in his writings,\r\nrevolt would be more than local. He could hardly hope to be allowed to\r\nland in the Islands, but Hong-Kong was a convenient point from which to\r\nwatch developments and to put forth his influence; and as to his family\r\nhe began to have a purpose that if carried out would take them beyond\r\nthe power of Spanish officers to hector and to wound. In October, 1891,\r\nhe sailed for Hong-Kong, where he hoped to establish himself in his\r\nprofession, to gather his family, and to be ready to help his\r\ncountrymen with the cautionary wisdom of which he held them to be most\r\nin need.\r\n\r\nHis hopes of professional success were better founded than he knew.\r\nAlmost at once he stepped into a large practice. This is not the usual\r\nexperience of new physicians in a new field, but his fame as an oculist\r\nhad gone before him. For the first time in his life he had unpledged\r\nmoney in his purse. He sent to the Philippines for his sister Lucia,\r\nwho happened then not to be in jail nor exiled nor pinioned to the\r\nmiseries of procrastinating law-courts, and in her company he tasted\r\nsomething of the novelty of ease. The project he had half formed about\r\nthe rescue of his harassed relatives took him in the following spring\r\nto Borneo. As it seemed to him virtually certain that his enemies would\r\ncontinue to pursue any one known to be near or dear to him, and there\r\nwas no career for them in Hong-Kong, he purposed to found a new\r\nhomestead for them under another flag. They were a numerous family, and\r\ninasmuch as the peculiar ideas of revenge we have found to be current\r\nin the Spanish colony made his second cousin or his great-grandmother a\r\nquite feasible substitute for himself in the way of vicarious\r\natonement, it was necessary to remove them all. In North Borneo the\r\nBritish authorities offered him on attractive terms an area of fertile\r\nland adapted to his purposes. He went to look at it, found it in all\r\nrespects suitable, and resolved to carry out his plan of a Rizal family\r\nrefuge. [160]\r\n\r\nFrom his happy country of those days not a soul could depart without\r\nthe sanction of the Government. To secure this for anybody connected\r\nwith him would be hard enough; even for an individual and a temporary\r\nabsence like Lucia’s it was hard. How much harder it would be to rescue\r\na whole tribe, and all so hated! Revenge was not so to be cheated, nor\r\nthe account of “Noli Me Tangere” left unsettled. If passports were to\r\nbe had at all, a personal explanation and appeal offered the best\r\nchance. This he determined to attempt, if he could have some reasonable\r\npromise of safety, being more inclined to go because thereby he might\r\nagain see his father and mother.\r\n\r\nIt was the Philippines in one of the recurrent spasms of reform that he\r\nmust now approach—sure sign in itself that a storm was brewing. A new\r\ngovernor-general, one Eulogio Despujol, expert, as was afterward\r\nproved, in the unctuous shaking of hands and the agile escape from\r\npromises, had arrived with much éclat and promulgated a liberal\r\nprogram. Rizal wrote to him, asking for permission and a safe-conduct\r\nto visit Manila.\r\n\r\nIn reply he received through the Spanish consul at Hong-Kong a passport\r\nand an unequivocal assurance of his safety in the Philippine Islands.\r\nSo equipped, he sailed with his sister Lucia, June 26, 1892. [161]\r\n\r\nFor this he has been much criticized on the ground that to return to\r\nManila was inconsistent with his former experiences there and virtual\r\ndeportation thence. If any one had been furnished with convincing\r\nknowledge of the duplicity of the Philippine Government, surely it was\r\nRizal. By the same token, it was said, he knew well the murderous\r\nattitude of the governing class toward him, and to go deliberately to\r\nthe thrusting of his head into those jaws was madness. These, again,\r\nare but the strictures of ignorance. Rizal returned to the Philippines\r\nunder a compelling sense of duty. At whatsoever cost to himself he must\r\ntry to rescue his family from the tireless pursuit of the Interests he\r\nhad offended, and the North Borneo project was clearly the way to\r\nachieve this. But it was a plan about which the Government would be\r\ncertain to object. If nothing else were handy, there was always the\r\nargument that it would draw inhabitants of the Islands into an alien\r\nterritory, and this reasoning could be met only by face to face\r\nencounter with the governor-general.\r\n\r\nBut Rizal was never deceived as to the nature of the trap into which he\r\nwas walking. Weighing all the chances he knew he was not likely to\r\nemerge alive. Therefore, he prepared and left with a friend two\r\ndocuments [162] to be made public if his enemies should succeed in\r\nkilling him.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was addressed “To the Filipinos” and constituted his\r\nfarewell to the people he had served so loyally, and a last confession\r\nof his faith. Men still study it for other reasons than he imagined. It\r\nis not only an expression of his professed creed but a revelation of\r\nhis soul and inmost thinkings on life and death. He shows here that in\r\nhis mind he had made no stranger of the great mystery but had looked\r\nupon it and without misgivings. There is no bravado in his attitude\r\ntoward it; he is unafraid because he has come to the logical conclusion\r\nthat there is nothing about death to be afraid of. When he shall go and\r\nhow do not concern a man, but only that his death shall mean something\r\nfor the general cause. In this spirit he begins his letter: [163]\r\n\r\n\r\n    The step I am about to take is undoubtedly attended with peril, and\r\n    I need not say to you that I take it after long deliberation. I\r\n    understand that nearly all my friends are opposed to it; but I know\r\n    also that hardly any one else comprehends what is in my heart. I\r\n    cannot live on and see so many persons suffer injustice and\r\n    persecution on my account; I cannot bear longer the fact that my\r\n    sisters and their families are treated like criminals. I prefer\r\n    death and cheerfully relinquish my life to free so many innocent\r\n    persons from such great wrong.\r\n\r\n    I am aware that at present the future of our country pivots in some\r\n    degree around me, that at my death many of its enemies will feel\r\n    triumph, and consequently many of them are now wishing for my fall.\r\n    What of it?\r\n\r\n    I hold duties of conscience above all else. I have obligations to\r\n    the families that suffer, to my aged parents whose sighs strike me\r\n    to the heart. If with my death I can secure for them happiness and\r\n    a peaceful home in their native land, I am ready. So far as the\r\n    country is concerned, I am all my parents have, but the country has\r\n    many, many more sons that can take my place and do my work better\r\n    than I.\r\n\r\n    Besides, I wish to show those that deny us patriotism that we know\r\n    how to die for duty and principle.\r\n\r\n    What matters death, if one dies for what one loves, for native land\r\n    and those dear to one?\r\n\r\n    If I thought that I were the only resource of the policy of\r\n    progress in the Philippines, and were I convinced that my\r\n    countrymen were about to make use of my services, perhaps I should\r\n    hesitate about this step; but there are others that can take my\r\n    place, and take it with advantage. Furthermore, there are probably\r\n    those that hold that I am not needed, and this is why I am not\r\n    utilized, but find myself reduced to inactivity.\r\n\r\n    Always I have loved our unhappy land, and I am sure I shall\r\n    continue to love it until my last moment, in case men prove unjust\r\n    to me. Life, career, happiness, I am ready to sacrifice for it.\r\n    Whatever my fate, I shall die blessing it and longing for the dawn\r\n    of its redemption.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other document was a letter addressed to his parents, brothers, and\r\nsisters. In it he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The affection I have ever professed for you suggests this step, and\r\n    time alone can tell whether it was wise. The wisdom of acts is\r\n    decided by their results, but whether these be favorable or\r\n    unfavorable, it may always be said that duty urged me; so if I die\r\n    in doing my duty it will not matter.\r\n\r\n    I realize how much suffering I have caused you; still I do not\r\n    regret what I have done. Rather, if I had to begin again I should\r\n    follow the same course, for it has been only duty. Gladly I go to\r\n    expose myself to peril. Not as an expiation for misdeeds (in this\r\n    matter I believe myself guiltless of any) but to complete my work I\r\n    offer myself an example of the doctrine I have preached.\r\n\r\n    A man ought to be ready to die for duty and his principles.\r\n\r\n    I hold fast to every idea I have advanced as to the condition and\r\n    future of our country. I shall willingly die for it and even more\r\n    willingly die to secure for you justice and peace. [164]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was his destiny to be betrayed and lied to. He went forth with the\r\nfaith of the Government pledged to his safety. No sooner had the ship\r\nthat bore him from Hong-Kong hoisted her anchors than the Spanish\r\nconsul cabled to Governor-General Despujol that the victim was in the\r\ntrap; [165] whereupon in Manila an accusation was filed against him of\r\ntreason and sacrilege. It appeared that Rizal’s forebodings about his\r\nfate were not fanciful; he was going into a den of wolves. When he and\r\nhis sister landed at Manila, a customs officer searched their baggage\r\nand pretended to find among Lucia’s possessions a package of\r\ntreasonable documents. The device is as old as tyranny and must have\r\nsuggested to La Fontaine one of his most famous fables. Here is the\r\nofficer showing certain papers and saying he found them in this trunk\r\nor that valise. Who is to gainsay him? The victim protests that she\r\nnever saw the documents before. What is her statement worth against the\r\nskilled vociferations of the officer? Rizal was right. In a country\r\noperated as Spain operated the Philippines every man’s life was at the\r\nmercy of any power that was able and wished to take it. [166]\r\n\r\nIn this instance the treasonable stuff was found, official superservice\r\nasserted, in certain pillow-cases that Lucia had in her trunk. When all\r\nwas done, it consisted of a brief circular or tract entitled “The Poor\r\nFriars.” Among reasoning men and enlightened systems of society,\r\ntreason is held to be a crime directed against Government; other\r\noffenses may be committed by individuals against individuals, but for\r\nthese the police and the ordinary criminal code are enough. The\r\nincendiary document Lucia was alleged to have brought in said nothing\r\nagainst the Government. This is the fact that will strike the modern\r\nreader as strangest of all. How can there be other treason or other\r\nsedition than against Government? Yet in all this document is not a\r\nword against anybody or thing except the friars and even as to the\r\nfriars speaks of but one order, and that in terms adults might smile at\r\nbut assuredly would never care to reread. Lest it should be thought\r\nthat any part of the description of the Insular Government attempted in\r\nthese pages is extravagant, here is the whole of this ferocious\r\ndocument:\r\n\r\n\r\n    POOR FRIARS\r\n\r\n    A bank has just suspended payment; the New Oriental has just become\r\n    bankrupt.\r\n\r\n    Great losses in India. In the Island of Mauritius, to the South of\r\n    Africa [sic], cyclones and tempests have laid waste its riches,\r\n    swallowing more than 36,000,000 pesos. These 36,000,000 represented\r\n    the hopes, the savings, the well-being, and the future of numerous\r\n    individuals and families.\r\n\r\n    Among those that have suffered most we are able to mention the\r\n    Reverend Corporation of the Dominicans, which lost in this\r\n    catastrophe many hundreds of thousands. The exact amount is not\r\n    known because they handle so much money and have so many accounts\r\n    that it would be necessary to employ many accountants to calculate\r\n    the immense sums in transit.\r\n\r\n    But, neither should the friends of these sainted monks that hide\r\n    behind the cloak of poverty be downhearted nor should their enemies\r\n    feel triumphant.\r\n\r\n    To one and all we can say that they can be tranquil. The\r\n    Corporation still has many millions on deposit in the banks of\r\n    Hong-Kong, and even if all of those should fail, and even if all of\r\n    their many thousands of rented houses should be destroyed, still\r\n    there would be left the curates and the haciendas, there would\r\n    still remain the Filipinos always ready to answer their call for\r\n    alms. What are four or five hundred thousands? Why take the trouble\r\n    to run about the towns and ask alms to replace these losses? A year\r\n    ago, through the bad business administration of the cardinals, the\r\n    Pope lost 14,000,000 pesos of the money of St. Peter; the Pope, in\r\n    order to cover this deficit, called upon us and we took from our\r\n    “tampipis” the very last cent, because we knew that the Pope has\r\n    many worries; about five years ago he married off his niece\r\n    bestowing upon her a palace and 300,000 francs besides. Therefore,\r\n    generous Filipinos, make a brave effort and likewise help the\r\n    Dominicans.\r\n\r\n    However, these hundreds of thousands lost are not theirs, they\r\n    claim. How can they have this when they take a vow of poverty? They\r\n    are to be believed then, when, to protect themselves, they say this\r\n    money belongs to widows and orphans. Very likely some of it belongs\r\n    to the widows and orphans of Calamba, and who knows if not to their\r\n    murdered husbands? And the virtuous priests handle this money\r\n    solely as depositories to return it to them afterward righteously\r\n    with all interest when the day to render accounts arrives! Who\r\n    knows? Who better than they can take charge of collecting the few\r\n    household goods while the houses burn, the orphans and widows flee\r\n    without meeting hospitality, since others are prohibited from\r\n    offering them shelter, while the men are made prisoners and\r\n    prosecuted? Who has more bravery, more audacity, and more love for\r\n    humanity than the Dominicans?\r\n\r\n    But now the devil has carried off the money of the widows and the\r\n    orphans, and it is to be feared that he will carry away everything,\r\n    because when the devil begins the devil has to finish. Does not\r\n    that money set up a bad precedent?\r\n\r\n    If things are thus, we should recommend to the Dominicans that they\r\n    should exclaim as Job: “Naked I came from the womb of my mother\r\n    (Spain), and naked will I return to her; the devil gave, the devil\r\n    took away; blessed be the name of the Lord”!\r\n\r\n        Fr[aile] Jacinto.\r\n\r\n                     Manila: Press of the Friends of the Country. [167]\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment in the Philippines had sunk so low that this could be deemed\r\nseditious.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, for some days thereafter the trap was not sprung upon the\r\nvictims. Rizal with his sister went about the city, visiting old\r\nfriends. More than once he called upon Governor-General Despujol and\r\nwas rather astonished to find that his footing seemed to be secure upon\r\nthe dark and slippery precincts of Malacañan. In his usual frank way he\r\ndiscussed with the governor-general the brand-new program of reforms,\r\ncommending most of their features and hoping for the best, as was\r\nlikewise his habit. Despujol, responding to all this, seemed equally\r\ningenuous. No one would have suspected that while he stressed so much\r\ngracious hospitality he was but waiting for the most convenient season\r\nto strike to death the man before him. Rizal pleaded in behalf of his\r\npersecuted relatives. Despujol promised immunity for the father, but\r\nnot for the brother or sisters. Afterward he was willing to concede\r\neven these favors. They discussed Rizal’s project of a settlement in\r\nNorth Borneo, and the governor-general applied his veto. For this he\r\ngave the expected reasons but never once the real one. He objected to\r\ntaking people out of the colony but said nothing about the wrath of the\r\nfriars if he should let their victims escape unhurt.\r\n\r\nRizal had long known well enough that the lack of unity among the\r\nFilipinos was chief reason why they were enslaved and to keep up this\r\ncondition chief point in Spanish policy. “Divide and rule”—the good old\r\nformula of the exploiter in all ages. To combat this he proposed an\r\norganization that would bring together the most promising elements\r\namong his people; a plan for it he had with him when he landed. It\r\nincluded the full working constitution of a society to be called La\r\nLiga Filipina, or Philippine League, of which the objects were declared\r\nto be to better economic conditions, to spread education, to advance\r\nthe Philippine youth, and to defend by legal means persons oppressed,\r\nwronged, or unjustly accused. He now called together his friends, [168]\r\nexplained the purposes of the league, and began to enroll members.\r\n\r\nThe real nature and front-parlor origin of this association [169] were\r\nof a nature to occasion in these days only a mild surprise that anybody\r\ncould object to it, as may be observed from the following precepts\r\nRizal prepared for his fellow-members:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Don’t gamble.\r\n    Don’t be a drunkard.\r\n    Don’t break the laws.\r\n    Don’t be cruel in any way.\r\n    Don’t be a rabid partisan.\r\n    Don’t be merely a fault-finding critic.\r\n    Don’t put yourself in the way of humiliation.\r\n    Don’t treat any one with haughtiness or contempt.\r\n    Don’t condemn any man without first hearing his side.\r\n    Don’t abandon the poor man that has right on his side.\r\n    Don’t forget those that although worthy have come to want.\r\n    Don’t fail those without means that show application and ability.\r\n    Don’t associate with immoral persons or with persons of bad habits.\r\n    Don’t overlook the value to your country of new machinery and\r\n    industries.\r\n    Don’t cease at any time to work for the prosperity and welfare of\r\n    our native land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE EXILE OF DAPITAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this was nothing sinister, illegal, revolutionary, affrighting,\r\nor incendiary, but the Spanish colony chose to view it with alarm. If\r\nRizal had organized a prayer meeting or a branch of the Young Men’s\r\nChristian Association these nervous folk would have seen in it only\r\ntreason, stratagems, and spoils. On the Filipinos the effect was\r\ndifferent. To the deliberate judgment of the intelligentsia the plan of\r\nthe league appealed as the first practical suggestion of relief through\r\npeaceful agitation. With a novel sensation of hope, they took it to\r\ntheir bosoms. [170] Rapidly the membership increased; at last there was\r\na promise of union and directed effort. And then the powers that stood\r\nbehind the puppet governor-general and manipulated his movements\r\ndecided that the ripe time had come to spring the trap; before this\r\ndangerous man should have back of him an organization able to realize\r\nhis dreams he must be put to silence. Despujol sent for Rizal, leaped\r\nupon him as if from a machine with the leaflet, “The Poor Friars,” that\r\nmen said had been found in Lucia’s baggage, and without trial or\r\nhearing ordered him to prison. From the spot where he stood in the\r\ngovernor-general’s office a guard took him to Fort Santiago and thrust\r\nhim into a cell. Another generation will not believe that this was\r\ndone; and even in our own era, in which invasions of personal rights at\r\ntimes of great public excitement are not unknown, an act of such rank\r\nand impudent despotism seems improbable. There was not even a pretense\r\nof any legal proceeding, no warrant, no magistrate, no commitment.\r\n“Take this man to jail!” commands the governor-general. With an\r\nobedient start the guard sweeps away the prisoner, helpless in a square\r\nof rifles. It is enough to cause us to wonder if democracy and liberty\r\nare or can be more than veneer upon any old frame of European monarchy\r\nand whether time, in this conception of human society, must not\r\nnecessarily stand stock-still.\r\n\r\nAt Santiago guard was mounted [171] upon the mild reformer and man of\r\npeace as if he had been some ferocious bandit captured red-handed and\r\nlikely to burst his bars. Sentinels stood day and night over his cell\r\ndoor; no communication was allowed with his friends; and grown men in\r\nthe official service went through the theatrics of pretending that\r\nthere was danger of an attempt to rescue him.\r\n\r\nThe next day a decree was issued ordering his exile to Dapitan, a town\r\non the northeastern coast of the island of Mindanao. Upon what charge?\r\nThe charge of sacrilege and sedition made against him the day he sailed\r\nfrom Hong-Kong, reinforced with Lucia’s damnable pillow-cases. On these\r\nhe had been adjudged guilty offhand, as one would drown cats or blind\r\npuppies. He was not even allowed to know who were his accusers; for\r\nthat matter, he did not even know that he was accused. “This fellow has\r\ncommitted sacrilege and sedition,” says some one in the ear of the\r\ngovernor-general. “Exile him,” replies the governor-general, and signs\r\nthe order committing him to a living death. It is like the scene\r\nbetween the governor-general and his secretary in “El Filibusterismo”;\r\nif a man may have foreknowledge of his fate, Rizal had glimpsed this in\r\nhis novel.\r\n\r\nThere was the matter of the safe-conduct, the promise of protection,\r\ngiven by this same governor-general, under which Rizal had left\r\nHong-Kong. It seems to have been not a feather-weight against the\r\nInterests that cried for his blood. There need be no mystery as to the\r\nsource of these perfidies. Exile was the price Rizal paid for writing\r\n“Noli Me Tangere”; the powers that now pushed him upon the savage coast\r\nof Mindanao as an outcast sent there to die was the power of the\r\nfriars, enraged by these pictures of themselves. They demanded Rizal’s\r\nblood; Despujol seems to have been incapable of the firing-squad and\r\nonly wicked enough to consent to exile.\r\n\r\nA chorus of protest rose from the civilized world as soon as men\r\nlearned of this latest assault by a stupidly malignant Government upon\r\nthe foundation principles of modern liberty. In hugger-mugger Rizal\r\nmight be snatched away to banishment, but the time had gone by when\r\nsuch things could continue to be hid. It was speedily known throughout\r\nEurope that he had been decoyed from Hong-Kong by promises now shown to\r\nhave been deliberate inventions; that the governor-general had violated\r\nhis own safe-conduct; that, even if Lucia had possessed a seditious\r\ndocument, proceedings should have lain against her and not against\r\nRizal; that in any society above that of the jungle he would have had a\r\nhearing or some form of trial. Some such storm of resentment seems to\r\nhave been foreseen by Despujol. For the issue of the “Official Gazette”\r\nthat announced Rizal’s banishment he had prepared a long article\r\ndefending the Government’s course and describing Rizal as a dangerous\r\nperson. But he sufficiently betrayed himself by writing to the governor\r\nof Santiago prison a personal letter instructing him to take every\r\nprecaution that Rizal should not see this number of the “Gazette,” and\r\nbeyond this in cowardice and infamy it seemed hardly possible to go.\r\n[172]\r\n\r\nFor three days the victim of the aroused wrath of the governing class\r\nlay in prison, being still denied any communication with friend or\r\nrelative. Then at night he was hustled aboard a steamer and started for\r\nDapitan.\r\n\r\nSo far as we can determine now, even in these conditions he lost\r\nnothing of that serenity that has made him so admirable to some\r\ninvestigators and so inexplicable to others. “Sustained and soothed by\r\nan unfaltering trust” seems to have been literally the state of this\r\nbrown man from the ends of the earth. Many a white man far less tried\r\nmight have envied his self-possession. Dwell with some patience and\r\ncare, if you will, upon this his own record of his arrest and\r\ndeportation and see if you do not deem this remarkable that in such\r\nconditions not a complaint, not a suggestion of resentment or of\r\nbitterness, not a hint of fear occurs in his narrative. It is a plain,\r\nblunt story written only for his friends. Here if anywhere he would\r\nhave exhibited wrath; and the story reads with a kind of chill, so\r\nperfect is the unconcern. You can hardly say it reads as if it were\r\nwritten about the sufferings of somebody else. For anybody else in the\r\nlike conditions this man would have made protest. Concerning himself he\r\nhad nothing to say except to record the facts. Here is what his\r\nmemorandum says of all this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wednesday he [the governor-general] asked me if I persisted in my\r\n    intention of returning to Hong-Kong. I told him “yes.” After some\r\n    conversation he said that I had brought political circulars in my\r\n    baggage. I replied that I had not. He asked me who was the owner of\r\n    the roll of pillows and petates [173] with my baggage. I said that\r\n    they belonged to my sister. He told me that because of them he was\r\n    going to send me to Fort Santiago. Don Ramón Despujol, his nephew\r\n    and aide, took me in one of the palace carriages. At Fort Santiago,\r\n    Don Enrique Villamor, the commander, received me. The room assigned\r\n    to me was an ordinary chamber. It had a bed, a dozen chairs, a\r\n    table, a wash-stand, and a mirror. There were three windows. One,\r\n    without bars, looked out on a court; another had bars, and\r\n    overlooked the wall and beach; the third served also as a door and\r\n    had a padlock. Two artillerymen were on guard as sentinels. These\r\n    had orders to fire on any one that tried to make signs from the\r\n    beach. I could neither write nor converse with the officer of the\r\n    guard.\r\n\r\n    Don Enrique Villamor, the commander of the fort, gave me books from\r\n    the library.\r\n\r\n    Each day the corporal of the guard proved to be a sergeant. They\r\n    cleaned the room every morning. For breakfast, I had coffee with\r\n    milk, a roll, and coffee-cake. Luncheon at 12:30 was of four\r\n    courses. Dinner was at 8:30 and similar to the luncheon. Commander\r\n    Villamor’s orderly waited on me.\r\n\r\n    On Thursday, the 14th, about 5:30 or 6 P.M., the nephew notified me\r\n    that at 10 that night I should sail for Dapitan. I prepared my\r\n    baggage, and at 10 was ready, but as no one came to get me, I went\r\n    to sleep.\r\n\r\n    At 12:15, the aide arrived with the same carriage that had brought\r\n    me there. By way of Santa Lucia Gate, they took me to the Malecon,\r\n    where there were General Ahumada and some other people. Another\r\n    aide and two of the Guardia Veterana were awaiting me in a boat.\r\n\r\n    The Cebu sailed in the morning at 9. They gave me a good\r\n    state-room, on the upper deck. Above the doors could be read,\r\n    “Chief.” Next my cabin was that of Captain Delgras, who had charge\r\n    of the party.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen soldiers from each branch of the military service comprised the\r\nexpedition. There were artillery, infantry of five regiments,\r\ncarbineers, cavalry, and engineers, and the Civil Guard.\r\n\r\n\r\n    We were carrying prisoners, loaded with chains, among whom were a\r\n    sergeant and a corporal, both Europeans. The former was to be shot\r\n    for having ordered the tying up of his superior officer who had\r\n    misbehaved while in Mindanao. The officer, for having let himself\r\n    be tied, was dismissed from the service. The soldiers who obeyed\r\n    orders, were sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears that the misbehavior noted here by Rizal consisted of the\r\nseduction of the sergeant’s wife by the officer, and the tying up of\r\nthe officer was the sergeant’s revenge. It is an interesting side-light\r\non the prevailing code that the officer was dismissed from the service\r\nfor allowing himself to be tied but not for dishonoring the poor\r\nsergeant, whose recompense was to be shot. The privates were to be\r\npunished for laying hands upon an officer, although they were but\r\nobeying orders. [174]\r\n\r\n\r\n    I ate in my state-room, the food being the same as the officers\r\n    had. I always had a sentinel and a corporal on guard. Every night\r\n    Captain Delgras took me for a promenade till 9 o’clock. We passed\r\n    along the east coast of Mindanao and the west coast of Panay. We\r\n    came to Dapitan on Sunday at 7 in the evening.\r\n\r\n    Captain Delgras and three artillerymen accompanied me in a boat\r\n    rowed by eight sailors. There was a heavy sea.\r\n\r\n    The beach seemed very gloomy. We were in the dark, except for our\r\n    lantern, which showed a roadway grown with weeds.\r\n\r\n    In the town we met the governor or commandant, Captain Ricardo\r\n    Carnicero. There was also a Spanish exile, and the practicante,\r\n    [175] Don Cosme. We went to the town hall, which was a large\r\n    building.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is all there is of this laconic narrative. Under the conditions it\r\ncan hardly be equaled for philosophical phlegm. “The beach seemed very\r\ngloomy”; “As no one came to get me, I went to sleep.” It sounds like\r\ncasual notes on a holiday jaunt. In point of fact, he was in danger at\r\nall times of assassination and knew it well. He must have rather\r\nwondered at his fortune when he saw the beach at Dapitan and realized\r\nthat he had arrived without being murdered. [176]\r\n\r\nIt was a little town on the border of a savage country, known to be\r\nunhealthful, and at that time so difficult of access from Manila that\r\nhe might have been nearer at Yokohama. It is charitable but hardly\r\nnecessary to believe that the men that consigned him to such a place\r\nwere unaware of its repute. With so little concealment they had sought\r\nin other ways for his life, we have no reason to think now of a sudden\r\nthey had acquired mercy. To a thousand places more salubrious he might\r\nas easily have been sent; none would satisfy them but this.\r\n\r\nAt Dapitan were a military station, a convento, and several priests.\r\nRizal was informed that if he would make a declaration of sympathy and\r\nadmiration for Spain he could reside at the convento with the priests.\r\nEven for that privilege, dear to an intellectual man, hungry for the\r\ncompany of his educated fellows, he would not lay perjury on his soul.\r\n[177] Strange as the temptation seems to us in these days, the tempters\r\nknew well what they had in view. With such a declaration they could\r\nnullify much of Rizal’s influence upon his countrymen and possibly\r\nallay something of the spirit of revolt that on all sides was rising in\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\nTo the commandant’s house, accordingly, he was assigned. It was but\r\nrude commons and a primitive environment. The sudden and cold plunge\r\nfrom the place of respect he had held in Europe and his profitable\r\nposition in Hong-Kong would have overwhelmed a weaker spirit. Rizal\r\naccepted the stern mutations with the unruffled composure that was\r\nalways his strong anchor in whatsoever difficulties. “No man bears\r\nsorrow better,” says the antique Roman of himself; but you would not\r\nlook for a recrudescence of Marcus Brutus in a Malay of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit he now arranged his time upon a schedule after his\r\ninvariable custom, and resumed cheerfully a life of study and work.\r\nUnder the parole he had given that he would make no attempt to escape,\r\nhe was allowed to go about as he pleased and without observation, for\r\nit is singular that this traitor and dangerous character was implicitly\r\ntrusted even by his enemies so far as any question of personal honor\r\nwas concerned. He had never a guard in Dapitan. Not only so, but the\r\ncommandants, one after another, and all the soldiery, from private to\r\nhighest officers, fell under the potent charm of his manner and became\r\nhis friends and admirers. The commandants were frequently changed. Each\r\nin turn came to Dapitan warned against the perilous prisoner there and\r\ntherefore bristling with dislike; each went away swearing he was the\r\nprince of good fellows and sorry for his fate.\r\n\r\nAt all times he was the most industrious of exiles; he must have had a\r\nspirit akin to the genius of perpetual motion. Day after day he plunged\r\ninto the woods to study the animal life of the region, collect\r\nspecimens and write elaborate notes about shells, bugs, crawling\r\nthings, trees, and flowers. He explored the coasts of Mindanao and\r\nvisited the native villages. With evident enthusiasm he revived his\r\nethnological pleasures and collected native implements, weapons and\r\nmanufactures, many of which from his hands are now in the museum of\r\nDresden, for instance. [178] True to his natural inclinings, one of his\r\nfirst employments had been to look about him at the chances the\r\nchildren of that region had to gain even the rudiments of education.\r\nFinding they had next to nothing, he gathered them about him and began\r\nto teach. He was also busy at times with his professional\r\nministrations. Patients began to seek him from Manila, from Hong-Kong,\r\nand even from more distant places, so great was his reputation as an\r\noculist. With the fees they paid him he embarked upon beneficent\r\nenterprises that revealed another reserve in his resourceful mind.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was a lighting system for Dapitan; the next,\r\nwaterworks, which he devised, planned, and superintended in person,\r\ngoing back to the engineering lore he had learned at the Ateneo and\r\nthen laid aside. Much of the construction was difficult, and engineers\r\nstill wonder at the skill and courage he showed in meeting its\r\nproblems. He and his workmen were without the proper tools; they must\r\nimprovise their own materials, and bring the water a long distance over\r\nvalleys and around hills; but they conquered every obstacle. [179]\r\n\r\nWhen this task was done he bought him a tract of land close by the\r\ntown, built a house on it, and established there adequate quarters for\r\nhis school.\r\n\r\nThis may be a good place to say what this singular person was in some\r\nof the sciences to which he gave so much of himself. As a physician,\r\nwhile still a student at Madrid University, he had made commentaries of\r\nremarkable merit, “Apuntes de Obstetricia” and “Apuntes Clinicos.” As\r\nan ophthalmologist he seemed to win at once to distinction as soon as\r\nhe left the university. This Dr. de Weckert of Paris, to whom he went\r\nfirst, was of too great repute and too well supplied with candidates to\r\nhave selected him for chief laboratory assistant if he had not been of\r\nunusual attainments. It appears that de Weckert was so much impressed\r\nwith this brown man from Malaya that they began a warm friendship that\r\nlasted until Rizal’s death, and so long as he remained in Paris he was\r\nthe great oculist’s favorite companion and collaborateur. In\r\nHeidelberg, Leipzig, and Berlin he was the associate and assistant of\r\nmen like Galezowsky and Schulzer. In the few months that elapsed\r\nbetween his first return to the Philippines and his departure thence at\r\nthe veiled order of Terrero, he received in fees more than five\r\nthousand pesos, a sum equivalent to about fifteen thousand pesos of the\r\npresent day. At Hong-Kong, for the short time he was there, his office\r\nwas overrun with patients from all that part of the world. As we have\r\nseen, they followed him even to far Dapitan. One of them was an\r\nEnglishman that made him a present of five hundred pesos, brown man and\r\nMalay as he was.\r\n\r\nAs an ethnologist, he was an honored member of the leading ethnological\r\nsocieties of Europe, and his close friendship with Blumentritt we have\r\nnoted. Dr. Meyer, director of the Royal Saxony Ethnographical Institute\r\nof Dresden, regarded him with admiration as a great scholar and great\r\ninvestigator. With Meyer and with Virchow he was on terms of\r\nconfidential intimacy. These were men in whom ordinarily confidence was\r\na plant of slow growth. They were drawn to and believed in Rizal\r\nbecause he had mastered their specialty and could meet them in it on\r\ntheir own footing. All those rare and abstruse works of Müller,\r\nPerschel, Ratzel, and the other great leaders in ethnological research\r\nhe knew well [180] and, what was better, he had ideas of his own about\r\nthem. Not only then but long before; he had been mulling over\r\nethnological principles while he was teaching Filipino boys at the\r\nAteneo the best way to land on the solar plexus of a young Spanish\r\nbully.\r\n\r\nAs a naturalist he enriched the museums of Europe and Manila with\r\nhundreds of specimens of his gathering and preparing. Flowers, plants,\r\ncrustaceans and all forms of animal life attracted his study. The\r\nGerman museums were so well pleased with his work that they offered\r\nhim, while he was in Dapitan, a remunerative salary to devote himself\r\nentirely to gathering specimens for them, and they still exhibit his\r\ncollections among their most valued possessions. Three creatures,\r\npreviously unknown to science, now bear his name because he discovered\r\nthem. One is a frog called the Rhacoperus Rizali; the second is a\r\ncoleopter called the Apogonis Rizali; and the third, a dragon called\r\nthe Draco Rizali.\r\n\r\nIn philology, Rizal won the friendship and esteem of Dr. Reinhold Rost,\r\nsaid to have been the greatest philologist of the nineteenth century,\r\nand was himself one of its most wonderful polyglots. While he was at\r\nDapitan, to baffle the censor, he wrote a letter to his sister that he\r\nbegan in colloquial German, carried on in colloquial English, and\r\nconcluded in colloquial French. [181] But this was for him a most\r\ntrifling exploit and hardly worth noticing. Besides these and Spanish,\r\nof which he was a master, he spoke Latin, Greek, Arab, Sanskrit,\r\nHebrew, Swedish, Dutch, Catalan, Italian, Chinese, Japanese,\r\nPortuguese, Russian, Tagalog, Visayan, and the Moro dialects of\r\nDapitan. One of his papers, a scientific treatise on the Visayan\r\nlanguage, was read before the Ethnographical Society of Berlin. He was\r\nassociated with Dr. Meyer and Dr. Blumentritt in the annotation of a\r\nChinese codicil of the Middle Ages. While at Dapitan he began to write\r\na scientific Tagalog grammar and a treatise on the resemblances between\r\nTagalog and Visayan speech. To amuse himself he would sometimes adorn a\r\ntitle-page or drawing with quotations in Hebrew, Sanskrit, Japanese,\r\nSpanish, and English.\r\n\r\nAs to other sciences, for example, he excelled in chemistry. Before he\r\nwas twenty-one he had obtained degrees as surveyor and agricultural\r\nexpert. He was an excellent engineer and so scientific an educator that\r\nwhen the Philippine Republic came to be erected the plan of the\r\neducational department and work was taken from his writings. In Leipzig\r\nhe went deeply into psychology, in which he was fellow-student with\r\nHugo Münsterberg. While he was at Dapitan he learned how to sail a\r\nship, and taught their trade to the fishermen, because he showed them\r\nhow to make and how to handle a better kind of net.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, he had the makings of a great journalist.\r\n\r\nConcerning his place as a poet, most of his poetry was written in\r\nSpanish and after the approved Spanish manner. Like other poetry it is\r\nvirtually incapable of translation. The thought may be indicated but\r\nnot the melodic significance, so important in Spanish, and of which he\r\nwas a facile master. How impossible it is to reproduce this in\r\ntranslation is apparent to one that will compare the five-line Spanish\r\nstanza as Rizal left it and the best English version of the same\r\nstanza. A poem that he wrote at Dapitan, “My Retreat,” [182] dedicated\r\nto his mother, is an adequate expression of the reverent attitude\r\ntoward nature that he managed to carry with him unimpaired in so many\r\nvicissitudes and long inhumations in the sordid dust of cities. This is\r\nthe first stanza in Mr. Derbyshire’s version: [183]\r\n\r\n\r\n    By the spreading beach where the sands are soft and fine,\r\n    At the foot of the mount in its mantle of green,\r\n    I have built my hut in the pleasant grove’s confine\r\n    From the forest seeking peace and a calmness divine,\r\n    Rest for the weary brain and silence to my sorrow keen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom poetry, we pass to sociology, a transition that might seem violent\r\nenough in one of less versatility. The commandants, of course, must be\r\nparts of the general machinery of espionage and report to Manila what\r\nthey observed in this evil sprite that might show dangerous\r\nmachinations against the peace and dignity of our lord the king. Some\r\nof the reports they made are still extant. One of them sent about this\r\ntime by a commandant, the Captain Ricardo Carnicero, to\r\nGovernor-General Despujol contains this account of a conversation:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Carnicero. Tell me, Rizal, what reforms seem to you most vital for\r\n    this country?\r\n\r\n    Rizal. First of all, to secure representation for it in the Cortes\r\n    [Spanish parliament] that there may be an end to the despotisms now\r\n    committed upon it.\r\n\r\n    Next to secularize the priesthood, [184] abolishing the power the\r\n    friars now exercise over the Government and the country. To\r\n    distribute the parishes as they become vacant, among the body of\r\n    the clergy, so that the clergy may be both Spanish and Philippine.\r\n\r\n    To reform the administration in all its branches.\r\n\r\n    To promote primary instruction, to end the interference of the\r\n    friars in the control of education, to give better salaries to both\r\n    men and women teachers.\r\n\r\n    To divide civil appointments equally between the Spaniards and the\r\n    Filipinos.\r\n\r\n    To cleanse the administration of justice.\r\n\r\n    To establish in capitals of more than 16,000 inhabitants schools of\r\n    arts and crafts.\r\n\r\n    These are my chief reforms. Once established in the right spirit,\r\n    the Philippines would be the happiest country in the world.\r\n\r\n    Carnicero. Friend Rizal, these reforms of yours do not seem to me\r\n    at all bad; but you seem to forget that the friars have as much\r\n    influence in Madrid as in Manila, and for this reason it would be\r\n    practically impossible at this time to put these changes into\r\n    effect.\r\n\r\n    Rizal. Do not think so. The influence of the friars is waning in\r\n    all parts of the world. I am bold enough to assure you that\r\n    wherever a government, even a little advanced, would give a free\r\n    hand to five or six honest and patriotic men, the power of the\r\n    friars would disappear. In Madrid it is perfectly well known what\r\n    the friars are doing here. So true is this that in the first\r\n    interview I had with Pi y Linares Rivas, when he was a member of\r\n    the Liberal party of Spain, he told me of things in this country of\r\n    which, although I was born here, I had been in ignorance. I can\r\n    cite to you many other instances of men in Spain that have exact\r\n    data on the lives and characters of the friars in the Philippines.\r\n    These gentlemen said to me: “The bad governments that in Spain are\r\n    following one another are blamed for many abuses that in reality\r\n    are wrought by the religious corporations. On the day when things\r\n    change we shall not forget the real offenders.” Excuse me for\r\n    saying this to you, but the friars are not wanted in the\r\n    Philippines. Always they become more repugnant and hateful as\r\n    always they interfere the more in conditions and affairs that do\r\n    not belong to them. [185]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere lay the sedition that Rizal plotted is evident from this report,\r\nand equally evident what power pulled the strings behind puppet king\r\nand manikin premier.\r\n\r\nHe must have had reason, even in far Dapitan, to wonder if there were\r\nany place out of range of the malicious or the dull. Persons that\r\nthought they had a call to reform him and other persons that believed\r\nthey had been appointed to torture him would not leave him alone even\r\nhere. It was a place with what was called a mail service; in the course\r\nof time almost any letter that had passed the censor would come limping\r\nin. Among such freight arrived one day a laborious effort from the\r\nsuperior of the Jesuits in the Philippines, the Rev. Father Pastells,\r\nin which he took occasion to offer disagreeable remarks. Rizal might\r\nhave responded in kind, if he had pleased; as to which, take note of\r\nsome of the sarcastic passages in “Noli Me Tangere.” Instead of\r\nflouting his reverend critic, he chose to favor him with a serious\r\nletter in which the faith that guided his course was set forth with the\r\neloquence of honesty. He wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    You exclaim: “What a pity that so gifted a youth should not have\r\n    used his talents in a better cause.” Possibly there are other\r\n    causes better than mine. But my cause is good, and that is enough\r\n    for me.\r\n\r\n    Others, perhaps, may gain more honors and greater glory. But I am\r\n    like the bamboo, which is also a native of this soil. It is used\r\n    for cottages of light material and not for heavy European\r\n    buildings. So I regret neither my humble cause nor its small\r\n    rewards. I only regret the little talent that God has given me to\r\n    use in its service. If instead of being weak bamboo I had been\r\n    solid hardwood, I should have been able to give better aid. But He\r\n    that made me what I am never makes mistakes in any of His acts. He\r\n    knows very well how useful are even the smallest cottages.\r\n\r\n    As to any fame, honor, or profit that I might have gained, I admit\r\n    all that to sound attractive, for I am a young man of flesh and\r\n    blood with a full share of human weaknesses. But no one chooses the\r\n    nationality or race into which he is born. With his birth he\r\n    profits by the privileges or suffers the disadvantages that race\r\n    and nationality bring. So I accept the cause of my country.\r\n\r\n    I have confidence that He that created me a Filipino will know how\r\n    to pardon in me mistakes due to our hard position and the poor\r\n    education we receive from our birth.\r\n\r\n    I am not working for fame or glory. I have no ambition to rival\r\n    others that are born into conditions very different from my own.\r\n\r\n    My only desire is to do all I can within the limits of my powers. I\r\n    wish most to do what is needed most. I have received a little\r\n    learning and I think I ought to teach it to my countrymen. Others\r\n    more fortunate than I may work for the great things. [186]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had letters of a different tenor from members of his family, toward\r\nwhom he yearned all his life with an almost singular devotion; but for\r\nhis strong sense of family duty he might then be receipting for great\r\nfees and living sweetly in Hong-Kong instead of facing the miseries of\r\nDapitan. Of this fact he never made a mention to any one, if he thought\r\nof it himself. Among the letters from these relatives that he held so\r\ndear came one from a nephew in Luzon to which he made the following\r\ncharacteristic reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I think I ought to mention to you a slight fault that you have\r\n    committed in your letter. It is a little error that many in society\r\n    make.\r\n\r\n    One does not say, “I and my sister greet you,” but “my sister and I\r\n    greet you.” Always you have to put yourself last. You should say,\r\n    “Emilio and I,” “you and I,” and so on. For the rest, your letter\r\n    leaves nothing to be desired in clearness, conciseness, and\r\n    spelling. Then keep on advancing. Learn, learn, and think much\r\n    about what you learn. Life is a very serious matter. It only goes\r\n    well for those that have intelligence and heart. To live is to be\r\n    among men, and to be among men is to strive.\r\n\r\n    But this strife is not a brute-like, selfish struggle, nor with men\r\n    alone. It is a strife with them, and at the same time with one’s\r\n    own passions. It is a struggle with the proprieties, with errors,\r\n    with prejudices. It is a never ending striving, with a smile on the\r\n    lips and the tears in the heart.\r\n\r\n    On this battle-field man has no better weapon than his\r\n    intelligence. He possesses no more force than he has heart. Bring\r\n    it out, then. Improve it, keep it prepared, and strengthen and\r\n    educate yourself for this.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon such a spirit the horrors of exile must have weighed little. In a\r\nregion strange, at that time uncouth and, compared with many in “your\r\nOriental Eden Isles,” unattractive, he offers to the world an\r\nunaccustomed figure of the outcast. He went without repining to regular\r\nand useful work while he understood well enough that he was a\r\nsacrificial offering and fated to be so; the hatred and contempt of the\r\nreactionary Interests were concentrated upon him; he was victimized for\r\nhis countrymen. Only two privations seemed poignant to him. He longed\r\nfor his family; he missed his books. With these, it appears, he would\r\nhave been content, eying cheerfully the fate that seemed to have at\r\nlast defined his career; for he had little doubt he should end his days\r\non this lonely shore. For consolation in his spiritual lack, he turned\r\nto his arts and modeled assiduously; some of the most marvelous of his\r\nsculptures belong to this period. Among them the bust of Father\r\nGuerrico [187] that was exhibited years afterward at the St. Louis\r\nExposition, and won a gold medal there. [188] He was the spontaneous\r\nartist that without conscious effort descries beauty in commonplace\r\nthings. Opposite his dwelling a native woman, bent upon one knee, was\r\ncleaning the street for a coming festival. Something in her pose and\r\ngarmenture struck him as a graceful characteristic; he modeled her as\r\nshe labored. [189] From memory he modeled busts and medallions of men\r\nhe had known in Europe and Asia; in his sketch-book he preserved\r\neffects he noticed in sky, sea, and woods. He returned to poetic\r\ncomposition and produced now some of the most beautiful of his works.\r\nMore than this in armor of patience the Stoics themselves could demand\r\nnothing. How many Highland Scotch have stood upon the sands of France\r\nand sighed away their souls northward? And how often have the\r\nsympathetic thought with compassion of the English pioneers in early\r\nAmerica, of the Pilgrim fathers that first bleak winter, of Hugo in\r\nJersey and Napoleon chained to his rock? This man hunted out the\r\nbeauties of exile, made them his friends and companions, taught his\r\npupils, made poetry, carved statues, loved his fellows, and thanked\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE KATIPUNAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTo his father and mother he wrote urging them to come to Dapitan and\r\nmake their home on the land that he had bought. In this he must have\r\nlightly estimated the rancor or the vigilance of his enemies, or have\r\nbeen imperfectly informed about what was going on in Manila—or both. It\r\nwas a time when all suspected persons were to be watched with unusual\r\ndiligence, and of these the Rizal family came first. Meantime, the\r\nexile’s fate, of which he was wont to take a somber view, shifted\r\nsomewhat its familiar aspect of misfortune and sent him one gleam of\r\nhappiness. In the midst of his lonely state and Promethean miseries\r\nadroitly prepared for him, he met a woman that attracted him, and ended\r\nby marrying her.\r\n\r\nThis came about after a strange fashion. All this time he had been\r\nfaithful to the memory of Leonora. [190] A few months after he had\r\ntaken up his residence in Dapitan there came thither a patient from\r\nHong-Kong named Taufer, an American engineer, blind, and drawn to\r\nDapitan by the fame of the great oculist. [191] He had with him his\r\nadopted daughter Josefina, who promptly fell in love with Rizal. Her\r\nreal name was Josephine Bracken; her parentage was Irish. Her father\r\nhad been a non-commissioned officer in the British army and stationed\r\nat Hong-Kong. When he died he left a large family in extreme poverty.\r\nTaufer, who was a kindly man of some means, adopted the youngest child\r\nas a matter of charity and then grew to love her as if she had been his\r\nown daughter. For seventeen years she had been his daily companion; in\r\nthe long night of his blindness she was his guide and comforter.\r\n\r\nIf her portraits do her justice, Josephine must have had unusual\r\nbeauty, but her letters do not reveal in her the intellectual gifts\r\nthat would have made her an ideal companion for José Rizal. Yet she\r\nmust have been sympathetic, and he, solitary at the world’s outpost,\r\nseems to have been fond of her. When he came to ask her hand in\r\nmarriage of her guardian, Mr. Taufer was overcome with grief. An hour\r\nlater, he attempted suicide. He was blind; the examinations of Rizal\r\nhad shown no chance that his eyesight could be restored; a daughter of\r\nhis had but lately left him to be married; he had lost his first wife;\r\nhis second marriage had not been happy; and he felt that without\r\nJosephine there was nothing to live for. Rizal came upon him razor in\r\nhand about to carry out his threat and narrowly rescued him from\r\nhimself. [192]\r\n\r\nAfter this, a marriage seemed impossible, and Josephine returned to\r\nHong-Kong with Taufer.\r\n\r\nBut the affair had gone so far that already Rizal had made overtures to\r\nthe parish priest to perform the ceremony. The priest shook his head:\r\nthere were Rizal’s well known heresies in the way; he could not marry a\r\nheretic. Rizal said that if by heresies his political opinions were\r\nmeant, nothing could induce him to profess any change in them; but if\r\nthe priest meant religious views, he was ready to declare that he was\r\nand had been at all times a faithful son of the Catholic religion and\r\npurposed so to remain. The priest thought a declaration to this effect\r\nmight win past the bishop, who now appeared as the chief obstacle; at\r\nleast he would send to Cebu to find out. The letter of inquiry he had\r\nwritten and was about to despatch when news came that the engagement\r\nhad been broken. The letter was never sent.\r\n\r\nNone the less, Rizal and Josephine continued to regard themselves as\r\nplighted, and after a time in Hong-Kong Mr. Taufer was won over to\r\nconsent to their union. Josephine went to Manila, where she made the\r\nacquaintance of Rizal’s mother and sisters. She was about to start for\r\nDapitan to renew the attempt to gain the sanction of the church when in\r\na conversation Mrs. Mercado reminded her that there were two views of\r\nthis proceeding. It was doubtful if the bishop could be induced to\r\nthink well of the marriage; but even if he could his permission would\r\nthen be regarded as evidence of compromise on Rizal’s part. In the\r\nopinion of many of his countrymen he enlisted against the church when\r\nhe enrolled against the friars; since the religious orders had come to\r\ncontrol the ecclesiastic as well as the political administration, the\r\ndistinction between church and friar was to some minds fairly vague.\r\nMrs. Mercado desired that nothing should weaken her son’s influence; a\r\nconstancy from which we may surmise of what fighting stock she came.\r\nShe knew that anything that looked like compromise would hearten his\r\nenemies and dismay his friends. Therefore, she suggested a civil\r\nmarriage, the church to be ignored. Civil marriages and even common-law\r\nmarriages were now authorized by the laws of Spain, and, if not yet\r\ndecreed in the islands, were legally binding there. [193]\r\n\r\nThis advice the lovers deemed good when Josephine reached Dapitan and\r\nreported it; there was no more talk of a dispensation from the bishop\r\nof Cebu. A marriage ceremony was performed by the simple device of the\r\ntaking of hands before witnesses and the registering of their mutual\r\nvows.\r\n\r\nRizal’s stout-hearted mother succeeded about this time in winning\r\npermission to visit her son; later came two of his sisters. Their\r\npresence revived in him the hope he had once cherished of uniting his\r\nfamily in a spot where, after so much of strife and grief, they might\r\nbegin life afresh and be free from the friars that were the landlords\r\nand rulers of Biñan and Calamba. He could see no reason why Mindanao\r\nshould not be well adapted to their needs. Government could not urge\r\nagainst such a plan the objection it used against the North Borneo\r\nproject; Mindanao was Philippine territory. He wrote to Despujol asking\r\nfor the necessary permits and received a chilly answer reminding him\r\nthat he was an exile and an outcast and in no position to seek favors\r\nof his Government. Steady persistence in the face of whatever rebuff\r\nwas one of Rizal’s strongest traits; the man seemed as incapable of\r\ndiscouragement as George Washington was; and the philosophical reader\r\nof history may well consider the appearance of this quality in three\r\nmen that founded three nations, William the Silent, Washington, and\r\nRizal, and inquire whether in value to the world this possession did\r\nnot overtop all others. With one cherished hope crushed, he turned to\r\nanother. He set himself to improve agriculture in the region where he\r\nhad been marooned; he showed the farmers how they could raise better\r\ncrops and get better prices for them. From the United States, where in\r\nhis travels he had observed with interest the latest agricultural\r\ninventions, he imported modern farm machinery, using it upon his own\r\nplace and teaching its use to others. It has been the lot of few men to\r\nlead lives of such varied use to their fellows. He seemed to go through\r\nthe world with eyes observing whatever was done around him and mind\r\nconsidering how it could be done better.\r\n\r\nMeantime, in Manila great changes had been at work, of which he knew\r\nnothing. The discontent of the people, always growing, had begun to\r\nfind a new expression. Another leader had arisen, in all ways different\r\nfrom Rizal except in this that he, too, was an inevitable product of\r\nthe attempt to force upon a people a distasteful sovereignty. It has\r\nbeen much the fashion, particularly with writers of a scholastic bent\r\nor reactionary sympathy (which is probably the same thing), to speak\r\nill of Andrés Bonifacio. If we desire a just estimate of the forces\r\nthat worked in diverse ways for Philippine freedom, we are not to\r\ndismiss this man lightly [194] nor to speak of him with disrespect.\r\nSuccessful revolutions demand the man that thinks and the man that\r\nacts, Mazzinis and Garibaldis, Jeffersons and Washingtons. Rizal was\r\nthe Mazzini of the Philippine struggle; Bonifacio was its Garibaldi.\r\n\r\nHe was born in the working-class, was almost wholly self-educated, and\r\nat the time he began to be powerful in Philippine destiny was a porter\r\nin a maritime warehouse of Manila. In his youth he developed a passion\r\nfor reading; he read when other persons slept, ate, or idled. By\r\ndiligent study in the night-time he acquired a knowledge of history and\r\nits philosophy that in a man of his handicaps and employment was not\r\nless than marvelous and alone would have indicated a phenomenal\r\ncapacity. [195] He studied deeply the stories of other peoples\r\noppressed, the Israelites in Egypt, the Dutch under Spain, the American\r\ncolonies under England, the French under their monarchical system, and\r\nformulated from these a church militant of democratic faith and\r\nprinciples of which he was first the acolyte and then the devout\r\nminister. In the end it mastered all his thought and waking hours and\r\nbecame essentially his life. Something of the great truth he saw\r\nclearly that the substance of all real progress in civilization has\r\nbeen progress in democracy, and for the most part this has been won by\r\nhard blows, rude encounters, and illimitable sacrifices. He caught a\r\nglimpse of the magical stimulus that came to the world from the\r\nsuccessive emancipations of the American and the French peoples and\r\nanother glimpse of the probable effect of a similar emancipation on his\r\nown. Upon the condition of those countrymen of his, dragging at a chain\r\nthat stifled in them all mental vitality with all self-respect, he\r\nstared with growing impatience while he burned and fretted for another\r\nBunker Hill and another Yorktown.\r\n\r\nHe was of somewhat violent passions and such deficiencies in\r\nself-control as were to have been expected from his experiences and\r\ninadequate training. Nevertheless, he had great sincerity, a mind of\r\nextraordinary fertility, and a readiness for swift decision and action.\r\nHe showed himself to be indomitable when wholly concentered upon the\r\none cause; and his contribution to it is not now to be disparaged\r\nbecause he happened to come no nearer the academic walk than Lincoln\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nWhen Rizal, lured from Hong-Kong by false promises of safety, landed in\r\nManila, Bonifacio was twenty-nine years old. He had long revolved in\r\nhis mind the fact so patent to all observing Filipinos that the first\r\nstep to their freedom must be unity. About the time Rizal was founding\r\nhis Liga Filipina, Bonifacio was formulating another and much more\r\nportentous union. The two were launched about the same time; one in the\r\nopen, the other in the dark and with the utmost secrecy. Bonifacio\r\ncalled his society the Kataastaasang Kagalanggalangang Katipunan ng̃ mg̃a\r\nAnak ng̃ Bayan, which being interpreted means Supreme Most Respected\r\nAssociation of the Sons of the People. For brevity’s sake the long\r\nunwieldy name soon came to be shortened into K.K.K. or the Katipunan,\r\nand so remains in history. Bonifacio shaped it like a masonic lodge,\r\nwith a ritual, passwords, grips, and the swearing of fealty and\r\nsilence. Its avowed object was the overthrowing by force of the Spanish\r\npower and the establishing of the Philippine nation, free and\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nIt appears now that the name of Rizal was used as an honorary president\r\nof this society, [196] but wholly without his authority or even\r\nknowledge. For this unwarranted use Bonifacio was much to blame. It is\r\nlikely that he found at first some difficulty in securing recruits and\r\ntook advantage of Rizal’s great popularity. Either so, or what seems\r\nmore probable to us, he expected to have Rizal’s support for the\r\nKatipunan when it should have grown to formidable size. In either case,\r\nthe course was inexcusable. But we are to remember that Bonifacio,\r\nwarring against the most unprincipled and ruthless of powers, believed\r\nhe was justified in using any weapons that came to his hand.\r\n\r\nMonth after month the Katipunan spread among the disgusted and restless\r\nFilipinos—secretly, always; and we are to surmise that the care with\r\nwhich the movement was to be concealed until the instant of the blow\r\nrecommended it to people smarting under a Government so obese and still\r\nso viciously protected. How long this Government was ignorant of what\r\nwas going on nobody knows. If the vast network of spies and agents\r\nprovocateurs, with which Spanish, like Russian, rule was maintained,\r\nbrought in no hint of the mine that was being driven beneath the feet\r\nof the governing class, the spies must have made their first recorded\r\nfailure, and that concerning the one thing most important to their\r\nemployers. Filipinos, one may say, had not so known these ever busy\r\nbirds of ill omen.\r\n\r\nThe deportation of Rizal gave to the Katipunan a great impetus; the\r\nmasses of people bitterly resented the cowardice and perfidy that had\r\ncontrived at last to drag down the popular champion. At first they knew\r\nno way to voice their protest. The Katipunan relieved them of their\r\nuncertainty; it was the weapon thrust into their hands. A year went by\r\nunder this slowly darkening sky; then two years. Rizal was at Dapitan;\r\nit seemed likely he would remain there until his last day, for nothing\r\nwould soften the hatred with which the friars and patricians regarded\r\nhim, and their word was the country’s law. Yet if he could be brought\r\nback in the character of a revolutionary leader the whole country would\r\nrise behind him. Ingenious minds brooded upon the ease with which he\r\ncould be rescued. Only a small force of troops guarded Dapitan; it\r\ncould be overpowered by a handful of resolute men. Rizal’s habit was to\r\ntake long canoe journeys alone around the coast, pursuing his\r\nscientific inquiries; of his own will he would never violate his\r\nparole, but suppose he should be seized and carried off by force? He\r\ncould then be picked up by a British mail-steamer, be landed at\r\nSingapore, and be free. Intimations of these plans were conveyed to\r\nhim: he vetoed all of them. It was his word of honor that he had given\r\nnever to attempt to escape; not even with the least connivance at a\r\nrescue would he taint his word; not even by allowing other men to\r\nentertain a thought that his faith could be tainted; and not even in\r\ndealing with a Government that had dealt perfidiously with him.\r\n\r\nBonifacio, looking into the faces of his people, believed more strongly\r\nevery day that the time to strike was near at hand, and every day he\r\nlonged the more for the active assistance of Rizal. [197] He knew well\r\nenough the danger his movement stood in and how that danger increased\r\nhour by hour as knowledge of what was afoot spread and could be\r\ntherefore the less easily controlled. At last he went to the length of\r\nsending an emissary to see Rizal, to lay before him the plans for the\r\nrevolution and to ask his help. The messenger chosen was Pio\r\nValenzuela, a name afterwards famous and honored among his countrymen.\r\nTo disguise the real object of his visit he took with him a blind man\r\nupon whom, it was pretended, Rizal was to perform an operation. Helped\r\nby this ruse, the messenger had a fair chance to talk freely with the\r\nexile.\r\n\r\nWhat took place at their meeting was long in dispute. Enemies of\r\nPhilippine independence have asserted that in wrathfully rejecting\r\nBonifacio’s appeal Rizal declared himself against any effort for\r\nnational freedom. This is in accordance with a common process of\r\nover-emphasizing (for propaganda effect) Rizal’s dislike of force and\r\ndoubt of the present readiness of his people for self-government. It is\r\ncertain that he declined Valenzuela’s proposal and with some heat;\r\n[198] we may also believe that with all his might he strove to dissuade\r\nhis countrymen from violence. Yet there is testimony extant that when\r\nhe found all his pleadings were useless and the violence he feared was\r\nbut too likely he admitted that he could not in any event separate his\r\nsympathies from his struggling countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe disputed versions of his reply are not worth the attention they\r\nhave had, because, as has been pointed out here and more than once,\r\nRizal’s convictions on these matters are clear. One obvious reflection\r\nis enough to illustrate them. If he had lived through such strenuous\r\ndays as followed 1896 he would have been found in the front ranks of\r\nthose that fought for freedom and yet would never have ceased to mourn\r\nthat freedom could not be won in another way. As to this, “El\r\nFilibusterismo,” if there were nothing else, would be testimony enough;\r\nand if Philippine independence involved only sentimental and not\r\ncommercial interests there would be no attempt to distort or to obscure\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen Bonifacio received Valenzuela’s report of Rizal’s decision, he\r\nswore, after his fashion, and determined to press on with his own plans\r\nand forget the exile. Against the notion that the Philippines were\r\nunready for revolution or unfitted for self-government he set himself\r\nlike a man in a battle that has thrown away fear with his scabbard. He\r\nrecalled that, weighing duly the relative strengths of the antagonists,\r\nthe American colonists were not worse prepared for the struggle that\r\nset them free. Most revolutions, history had taught him, had been begun\r\nby people that fought with broken weapons or bare hands; witness\r\nCamille Desmoulins and the ragged crowd he led from the café in the\r\ncourtyard of the Palais Royal that fateful night in July. Hardly a\r\nweapon among them all more deadly than a hammer, and yet to the echo of\r\ntheir feet fell absolute government in every corner of Europe. All the\r\nworld now honors those empty hands; on the very spot where Desmoulins\r\naddressed the crowd, behold now his statue! Are revolutions ever\r\nwrought by well ordered ranks of daintily uniformed guards? Are they\r\never launched when every condition is fitted, like joiner-work, to\r\ntheir success? And, in fact, are they ever made to any man’s volition\r\nor by anything but blind destiny that sits behind the whirlwind?\r\n\r\nBonifacio, at least, had no idea of waiting until the Philippines\r\nshould be populated with university graduates able to demonstrate in\r\nscholarly phrases the philosophical sweetness of liberty. Desiring\r\nfreedom, he desired it then and there. Month by month, the Katipunan\r\nspread and carried with it, as a flood carries a straw, the catastrophe\r\nof this story.\r\n\r\nAt Dapitan life went on unchangingly. It is likely that Rizal had there\r\na happiness and a serenity he had not known since childhood. He says as\r\nmuch in one of his letters:\r\n\r\n\r\n    My life now is quiet, peaceful, retired, and without glory; but I\r\n    think it is useful, too. I teach here the poor but intelligent boys\r\n    reading, Spanish, English, mathematics, and geometry. Moreover, I\r\n    teach them to behave like men. I taught the men here how to get a\r\n    better way of earning their living, and they think I am right. We\r\n    have begun, and already success has crowned our trials.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe tells how even in that out-of-the-way place there were lessons for\r\nhim to learn; how he was taught there to steer and reef, to manage a\r\ncanoe, to speak Visayan, and the better to know his own country. “God\r\ncan send you your fortune,” he adds, “even amidst the persecutions of\r\nyour friends!”\r\n\r\nIn this letter he dwells with a kind of delight on his exacting labors\r\nin philology, of his studies in Tagalog and his Tagalog grammar, which\r\nhe had almost completed. It is plainly to be seen that his activities\r\nkept him from nostalgia, as his captivity from the turmoil of his years\r\nin the noisy and bitter world; and now he was happily married!\r\n\r\nBut man is not so easily separated from his Nemesis. Of a sudden all\r\nthis house of content fell in ruins about him.\r\n\r\nAll this time he was maintaining his correspondence with his friends,\r\nthe European scientists, and particularly with Dr. Blumentritt, [199]\r\nthe closest and most sympathetic of his intellectual allies. Early in\r\n1896 a letter from Dr. Blumentritt told him of the sad condition of the\r\nhospitals in Cuba. Yellow fever was raging in the Island, and there\r\nwere not nearly enough physicians to meet the emergency. No such report\r\ncould be made to Rizal without awakening in him his sympathy and\r\ninstinctive impulse to help whomsoever might be in distress. He wrote\r\nto the governor-general offering to go to Cuba as a volunteer physician\r\nin the government hospitals. There was a new governor-general now;\r\nDespujol had ended his clouded career and gone home. Governor-General\r\nBlanco accepted Rizal’s offer, and on August 1, 1896, the exile sailed\r\nfrom Dapitan for Manila. With him went Mrs. Rizal and his little niece.\r\n\r\nEven as a volunteer surgeon in the yellow fever hospitals he was\r\nnominally to be a prisoner always; hence he must go to Cuba by way of\r\nSpain and under the Spanish flag; otherwise Spanish sovereignty would\r\nlapse and he might escape from its power. He planned to reach Manila in\r\ntime to take the next mail-boat, the Isla de Luzon, for Barcelona,\r\nwhere he was to transship for Cuba. Mrs. Rizal was to reside in his\r\nabsence with his relatives at Biñan or in Manila. But the steamer that\r\ntook him from Dapitan made but a slow voyage. He had time to attend en\r\nroute a dinner in his honor at Dumaguete, and to perform an operation\r\non the eyes of a patient at Cebu. He reached Manila a few hours after\r\nthe Isla de Luzon had sailed. Nearly a month must elapse before another\r\nsteamer would start for Barcelona. Meantime he was detained on the\r\nSpanish cruiser Castilla, a beautiful vessel that two years later lay\r\nat the bottom of Manila Bay riddled with American shells. But his\r\nconfinement seems to have been easy. In a few days the officers were\r\nhis friends. The captain repeatedly invited members of his family to\r\ndine with him on board. Mrs. Rizal came to see him, and so did former\r\npupils of his that had drifted from Dapitan up to Manila. He wrote\r\nletters to his family, including one of great tenderness to his mother,\r\nin which he included loving messages to all the household at Los Baños.\r\n[200]\r\n\r\nThe captain of the Castilla was one of many Spaniards that\r\ncounterpoised the grim tale of his usual treatment under their flag.\r\nGovernor-General Ramón Blanco, still remembered in the islands for his\r\nkindly, gentle ways, was another. He furnished Rizal with letters of\r\nrecommendation to high Spanish officers in Spain and in Cuba. One of\r\nthese to General Azcárraga, Spanish minister of war, was as follows:\r\n[201]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               Manila, August 30, 1896.\r\n\r\n    Esteemed General and Distinguished Friend:\r\n\r\n    I recommend to you with genuine interest Dr. José Rizal, who is\r\n    leaving for the Peninsula to place himself at the disposal of the\r\n    government as volunteer army surgeon to Cuba. During the four years\r\n    of his exile at Dapitan he has conducted himself in the most\r\n    exemplary manner, and he is, in my opinion, the more worthy of\r\n    praise and consideration in that he is in no way connected with the\r\n    extravagant attempts we are now deploring, neither those of\r\n    conspirators nor of the secret societies that have been formed.\r\n\r\n    I have the pleasure to reassure you of my high esteem, and remain\r\n\r\n        Your affectionate friend and comrade\r\n            Ramón Blanco.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 3, the next mail-steamer, the Isla de Panay, departed for\r\nBarcelona, with Rizal as a kind of self-watched prisoner, guarded by\r\nhis parole and not otherwise; for here as before it is to be remarked\r\nas one of the curiosities of this story that however his enemies in the\r\nGovernment might hate him they seemed to have full confidence in his\r\nword of honor.\r\n\r\nBut while he was still waiting on the Castilla in the harbor disaster\r\nhad begun to ripen for him.\r\n\r\nThe whole Katipunan conspiracy was laid bare to the Government.\r\n\r\nAccording to the accepted story, on the night of August 19, the mother\r\nsuperior of a convent-school at Tondo burst upon the parish priest at\r\nhis house with information that she had discovered a terrible plot to\r\nmassacre all the Spaniards in the Islands. A brother of one of her\r\npupils was a member of the Katipunan. Assessments upon members of the\r\norder had now become frequent, as Bonifacio’s preparations drew to a\r\nhead. It is an ancient Filipino custom for the woman in each household\r\nto keep the purse for the men. This young man’s treasurer was his\r\nsister. Of late he had been coming to her so often for funds that she\r\ninsisted upon knowing what he wanted the money for. Then little by\r\nlittle she wormed his secret from him and fled with it to the mother\r\nsuperior, who took it to the padre.\r\n\r\nFather Gil seems to have made one leap with the news to the Civil\r\nGuard, who arrested the girl’s brother, forced a confession from him\r\n(probably with tortures), and, taking the priest in tow, went to the\r\nplace that the youth had said was the printing-office of the Katipunan.\r\nThere they found, or said they found, incriminating documents that\r\nrevealed the plot. [202]\r\n\r\nOr some plot. At the best of times, as we have seen, hysteria in the\r\ngoverning class of Manila slept on a hair-trigger, and, being once\r\nawakened, offered a credulity more than childlike to the most grotesque\r\ncreations of the most unhealthy imagination. On this occasion its\r\nmanifestations were of the worst. Such wild tales as flew about the\r\ncity in those days, and had the approval of grave men that must have\r\nknown better, were fit only for a group of children telling\r\nghost-stories in the dark. That in the middle of the night armed bands\r\nof ferocious, horrible natives were to steal upon the innocent repose\r\nof every white person and slit his throat from ear to ear as he slept,\r\nwas the least terrifying of these rumors, and the earliest fruitage of\r\nan aroused and exotic fancy. Curiously enough, it had no merit in\r\noriginality, but was wan and hoary with age; for one hundred and fifty\r\nyears, at every revolt of the overtaxed natives, it had been brought\r\nout and paraded. It even persisted to a later day and was used to\r\nfrighten adult Americans that might have been deemed beyond such\r\nmelodrama. Certain plans required American dislike of the Filipinos,\r\nand thus the dislike was to be engendered. In the present instance, it\r\ncan hardly be necessary to say to any Filipino reader that wholesale\r\nmurder was no part of Bonifacio’s plans, nor any other of the ogreish\r\nand blood-curdling designs that he was then said to have formed. That\r\nit seems needful to do him this justice before another public is only\r\nfurther evidence of the gross misrepresentation that interest and\r\nprofits have made of all this chapter of history.\r\n\r\nIn the madness of panic for an hour or a day men may and doubtless will\r\ndo strange things; the abject terror that shattered the reasoning\r\nfaculties of the governing class in Manila seemed only to increase with\r\ntime. There was first fear let loose on its wild charger and then its\r\nimmediate reaction, the thirst for revenge. A Spanish mob gathered at\r\nthe gates of Malacañan clamoring for instant and sanguinary reprisals.\r\nRizal in his flight across the American continent had commented sadly\r\non the lynching-parties that disgraced the Southern States of the\r\nAmerican Union. If he had been in Manila in those days he would have\r\nseen the same spirit displayed by the mob that demanded his own death.\r\nIt was 1872 come again, but infinitely worse. [203]\r\n\r\nAt the first alarm, Bonifacio and some others had made their escape; he\r\nwas now in the country proclaiming the republic and raising troops; but\r\nof Filipinos that still remained and could be accused of affiliation\r\nwith his hated society there was naturally no lack, and in a few hours\r\nthe jails were overflowing and the executioner overworked.\r\n\r\nWith almost the first breath of this midsummer madness, his enemies\r\nthought of Rizal. “Noli Me Tangere”! The time had come full cycle for\r\nrevenge for that flagrant insult. Days passed, and the object of their\r\nhatred lay there almost before their eyes, the broad yellow and red of\r\nSpain flapping over him, wholly at the mercy of the Government he had\r\nopposed. What hindered it that it did not seize him and thrust him into\r\nprison with the rest of the conspirators, and so to Bagumbayan and an\r\nend with him? After a time the impatient clerical party concluded that\r\nthe real obstacle was Ramon Blanco. With him the friars had never been\r\ncontent; after the uncovering of the Katipunan they accused him of lack\r\nof energy in killing rebels, and a feud sprang up between him and\r\nArchbishop Nozaleda. [204] By common report he was now at the crisis of\r\nthe play giving to the world an illustration of the folly of\r\nnationalistic generalizations. All Spaniards were supposed to hate and\r\nfear Rizal; Blanco, a Spaniard, would not deliver Rizal to the\r\ntorturers because he knew the man was innocent, and he was resolved at\r\nwhatsoever cost to stand between innocence and the lynchers. [205]\r\n\r\nBut if this was a worthy exhibition of virtue in Spanish character it\r\nled in the end to only another demonstration of the power of the\r\nfriars. They worked the cable to Madrid, and in two months they secured\r\nthe recall of Blanco [206] and the appointment of a man in his place\r\nthat had no scruples about judicial murder and much thumb-screwing.\r\nPolavieja was his name. The Philippines were not likely soon to forget\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut at the moment the victim the Interests Triumphant sought was\r\nslipping out of their hands. They must have reflected with\r\ninexpressible rage that he would have been helpless if they had but\r\nallowed him to remain in Manila instead of marooning him on the shores\r\nof Dapitan. Yet there was a chance that he could be clutched and\r\nbrought back and torn to pieces. Some news of the sirocco of rage and\r\nterror that had seized Manila reached the Isla de Panay. One of his\r\nFilipino fellow-passengers, Pedro P. Roxas, rich but a sturdy advocate\r\nof Philippine independence, foresaw what was at hand and quietly\r\nstepped ashore at Singapore, where he was under the protection of\r\nanother flag. Fervently he had urged Rizal to go with him, pointing out\r\nthat his enemies were certain to take advantage of the existing panic\r\nto kill him, and that as he was virtually a political fugitive he was\r\njustified in seeking a political asylum. He pleaded in vain: Rizal made\r\nanswer that he had done no wrong; he would not flee. [207] He held upon\r\nhis way, and at Suez the great claw descended upon him. On a cabled\r\norder from Manila he was put under arrest, and thence to Barcelona he\r\nwas a prisoner. [208]\r\n\r\nThe instructions were that he was to be returned as speedily as\r\npossible to Manila for trial. He arrived at Barcelona in the morning. A\r\nsteamer was to sail for Manila that afternoon. Nevertheless, for the\r\nfew hours he must stay in Barcelona he was thrust into prison, the\r\nsudden reversal of the confidence with which he had before been treated\r\nindicating plainly enough to the initiated which party was now in\r\ncontrol at Manila. By a strange turn of fate, the Spanish commandant at\r\nBarcelona was that same Despujol that had so basely decoyed him from\r\nHong-Kong into Spanish power and but for whom he might have been at\r\nthat moment safe beyond Spanish clutches. Despujol had the hardihood to\r\ncall upon the man whose life he had sold. Rizal received him with the\r\ntolerant spirit that was so marked in his character, for it is not\r\nrecorded of him anywhere that he uttered so much as one reproach\r\nagainst those that had wronged him; and Despujol seems to have felt\r\nsomething like contrition as he viewed the wreck he had made of a life\r\nso unusual.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the steamer left for Manila with Rizal a prisoner on it.\r\n\r\nIt is like a story of overruling destiny. News of the arrest, by this\r\ndevice, of the most illustrious savant in all the Spanish dominions,\r\none of the foremost scientists of the times, had been telegraphed about\r\nthe world and stirred a general resentment. All men that understood\r\ncolonial Spain looked with gloomiest forebodings upon his probable\r\ndoom, now that he was fanged by that medieval dragon. A plan was formed\r\nto rescue him when the steamer should reach Singapore by suing out a\r\nwrit of habeas corpus and so snatching him from Spanish authority.\r\n[209] So slender are the chances of fate that a mere decoration on a\r\nflag brought to naught this benevolent design. The steamer was the\r\nordinary packet-boat, but on this occasion she was carrying a few\r\ntroops to the Philippines. Being deemed, therefore, on this voyage to\r\nhave the status of a transport, she hoisted the Spanish royal ensign,\r\nand against that emblem the kindly plotters felt they had no right to\r\nproceed. Government vessels are not subject to the authority of other\r\nnations whose ports they chance to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n“I CAME FROM MARTYRDOM UNTO THIS PEACE”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was November 3, 1896, when Rizal, heavily guarded, passed again\r\nthrough the dark gateway of Fort Santiago, whence he had issued four\r\nyears before to go to Dapitan. Now his enemies had him wholly in their\r\npower; he was dragged to earth at last. Yet for a time they were\r\npuzzled how to proceed with him. Dull as they were and remote from the\r\nhighways of European thought, they were not unaware that the eyes of a\r\nscornful world were upon them. Therefore they could not, as in the\r\ncases of so many “unvalued men,” shoot him at sunrise on a dunghill.\r\nSome pretense of legality must be followed; there must be regard to\r\ndecency.\r\n\r\nBut of anything civilized men could call evidence against him or of\r\nreason for anything such men could call a trial there was no trace nor\r\nsuggestion. Say that the Katipunan was all that hysteria described it;\r\nnot a scrap of paper connected Rizal with it. He was not a member; he\r\nhad expressly disapproved of its aims; he had been an exile in Dapitan\r\nwhile it was being formed. How then? And what then? In all such\r\ndilemmas it had been the practice of the Government of the Philippines\r\nto resort to those medieval precedents that best befitted the theory\r\nupon which its authority was based. Where required testimony was not to\r\nbe stumbled upon it was usually to be produced with the thumb-screw and\r\nthe lash; to torture somebody into perjury was the sovereign specific.\r\nUpon these promptings the authorities seized Paciano, Rizal’s brother,\r\nand exercised upon him their most recondite arts. To his left hand was\r\nfitted the terrible screw; at his right were pen and ink and a\r\nstatement that his brother had part in the Katipunan conspiracy. Then\r\nthe screw was applied until the victim fainted with the pain. But he\r\nwould not sign; no, not for all the ingenious torments of their\r\ndevising. There was iron in the Rizal blood; father and mother had\r\nshown it. When the mother had started to trudge around Laguna de Bay,\r\nwhen the father had refused to submit to the tyranny of the friar’s\r\nagent, when José had dared to write “Noli Me Tangere,” they had\r\nvindicated their tribal inheritance. Paciano was all of the same stern\r\nrace. Day and night the horror continued; he was trussed up until he\r\nfainted again, and then was revived with stimulants for new sufferings,\r\nand still he would not sign. Then his mind began to wander; he was\r\nplainly unable to sign anything, and the torturers released him. [210]\r\n\r\nMeantime José, though undeceived as to his probable fate, fought for\r\nhis life with the resolute courage of his kin. He knew there was no\r\nevidence against him, that before no court with the least respect for\r\njustice could he be convicted. But he determined to make that\r\nconviction as difficult as possible and as shameful in the eyes of the\r\nworld. From his prison-house he issued this address:\r\n\r\n\r\n    My countrymen:\r\n\r\n    On my return from Spain I learned that my name had been in use,\r\n    among some who were in arms, as a war-cry. The news came as a\r\n    painful surprise, but, believing the incident to be closed, I kept\r\n    silence over what seemed to be irremediable. I now notice\r\n    indications that the disturbances are continuing, and lest any\r\n    persons, in good faith or bad, should avail themselves of the use\r\n    of my name, to stop such an abuse and to undeceive the unwary I\r\n    hasten to address you these lines and make known the truth.\r\n\r\n    From the very beginning, when I first had notice of what was being\r\n    planned, I opposed it, fought it, and demonstrated its absolute\r\n    impossibility. This is the fact, and witnesses to my words are\r\n    still living. I was convinced that the scheme was utterly absurd,\r\n    and, what was worse, would bring great suffering.\r\n\r\n    I did even more. When later, against my advice, the movement\r\n    materialized, of my own accord I offered not alone my good offices,\r\n    but my very life, and even my name, to be used in whatever way\r\n    might seem best, toward stifling the rebellion; for, convinced of\r\n    the ills which it would bring, I considered myself fortunate if, at\r\n    any sacrifice, I could prevent such useless misfortunes. This is\r\n    equally of record. My countrymen, I have given proofs that I am one\r\n    most anxious for liberties for our country, and I am still desirous\r\n    of them. But I place as a prior condition the education of the\r\n    people, that by means of instruction and industry our country may\r\n    have an individuality of its own and make itself worthy of these\r\n    liberties. I have recommended in my writings the study of the civic\r\n    virtues, without which there is no redemption. I have written also\r\n    (and I repeat my words) that reforms, to be beneficial, must come\r\n    from above, that those which come from below are irregularly gained\r\n    and uncertain.\r\n\r\n    Holding these ideas, I cannot do less than condemn, and I do\r\n    condemn this uprising—as absurd, savage, and plotted behind my\r\n    back—which dishonors us Filipinos and discredits those that could\r\n    plead our cause. I abhor its criminal methods and disclaim all part\r\n    in it, pitying from the bottom of my heart the unwary that have\r\n    been deceived into taking part in it.\r\n\r\n    Return then to your homes, and may God pardon those that have\r\n    wrought in bad faith! [211]\r\n\r\n        José Rizal.\r\n\r\n                                      Fort Santiago, December 15, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill remained for his enemies the necessity of a semblance of charges\r\nupon which might be based the semblance of a trial. As a move of\r\nobvious desperation they now fell back upon the fantasy that La Liga\r\nFilipina was an illegal body and upon the precarious assertion that\r\neven if he had no connection with the Katipunan it had been formed as a\r\nresult of his teachings. Upon these grounds and only these his life was\r\nto be sought; the first wholly untrue, the other tenuous and fraught\r\nwith grave danger to the existence of any system of justice. As for La\r\nLiga Filipina, that was as seditious as an average board of trade, and\r\nas secret; it had no purposes but economic improvement and Filipino\r\nunion. But the other charge was a different matter. If it could be held\r\nthat Rizal’s teachings were such that they instigated an uprising he\r\nhad always opposed, then any but a paralyzed dumb man could be held\r\nresponsible for anything that happened anywhere. Suppose, for instance,\r\na British newspaper to criticize severely the British prime minister,\r\nand the next day a man attempt the assassination of that minister. Who\r\nis to say, if this doctrine be sound, that the newspaper did not\r\ninstigate the murderous attempt? It is apparent that if such a view\r\nwere ever deemed valid an end would come to all free discussion or the\r\npretense of a free press; no journal would dare to have an opinion\r\nabout anything but the weather.\r\n\r\nThe inhibition would never stop with the press; the most ordinary and\r\nthe most useful activities of organized society would be put into\r\njeopardy. Suppose, for instance, Rizal had opposed and denounced\r\nvivisection, and a weak-minded man anywhere, maddened by the loss of\r\nhis pet dog, should assault the physician that had cut it to pieces.\r\nWho could say that Rizal under this doctrine was not the guilty\r\nassailant? Even supposing the man that did the deed never to have read\r\nRizal nor heard of him, Rizal’s influence might have been transmitted\r\nthrough many persons and still be his. It is evident that at once we\r\nplunge into limitless possibilities for oppression and wrong. Suppose\r\nan American reformer to denounce some official grafter and a fanatic to\r\nshoot that grafter. The reformer might be hanged, and the assassin go\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nOf all places in the civilized circuit the Philippine Islands were then\r\nthe most perilous in which to introduce such a theory. In the\r\nPhilippines an evil oligarchy maintained itself by terrorizing the\r\npopulation. Before its need and greed, justice was at best farcical. To\r\nadmit that any man that criticized its methods might be held\r\nresponsible for the acts of any revolutionist, murderer, or lunatic\r\nwhatsoever was to place in the hands of the oligarchy the last and\r\nworst of weapons. It would need nothing else to render unassailable and\r\nunlimited its already despotic power. The courts would be a hangman’s\r\nnoose.\r\n\r\nYet on such preposterous grounds and none other the terrible travesty\r\nof justice was now urged along. It is likely that since the days of\r\nCaiaphas has been no such desperate hunting for testimony against\r\ninnocence. “This man spake blasphemy,” cried the high priests, and,\r\nwhen they could find no confirmation of the charge, twisted to a\r\ndesired meaning the most casual utterance, the cross being made ready\r\nin advance. The proceedings were as illegal as unjust. Supposing the\r\noffenses charged to have been committed, they were under the civil law\r\nof the Islands. The civil law and the civil courts were brushed aside\r\nlest even in the Philippines they might fail of legalized murder, or\r\nhalt it; and the proceedings were held by court martial.\r\n\r\nBefore this tribunal, organized to slay, Rizal was brought bound, his\r\nelbows drawn back with cords so as almost to touch. Thus he must sit\r\nthroughout each session, though the notion that he might try to escape\r\nor to assault any one was obviously fantastic, for he was heavily\r\nguarded and the room was filled with soldiery. To a gratuitous malice\r\nall this must be ascribed, the malice of immature or perverted minds.\r\nThe torments he endured from aching muscles and constricted arteries as\r\nthus he sat grew almost intolerable while the long sessions dragged on,\r\nbut it is not recorded that the victim made complaint. He was not\r\nallowed an attorney, but a list of army officers was spread before him\r\nfrom among whom he might select counsel—so called. He found in the list\r\na name that had a friendly sound in his ear. It was de Andrade, and\r\nproved to be borne by a brother of the young army officer that had been\r\nassigned to watch him and had ended by becoming his warm admirer and\r\ncharmed companion on so many walks in 1887. But the choice of a counsel\r\nwas mere formality. Luis de Andrade did all he could to win justice for\r\nthe prisoner, but before such a court he might as well have used\r\nquestion with a wolf. [212]\r\n\r\nThere was no taking of testimony in any sense that civilized nations\r\nhave of that term. A few terrified Filipinos were put upon the stand,\r\nand answers were extracted from their lips to carefully prepared\r\nquestions; but cross-examination was not allowed, and the value of\r\ntheir admissions was nothing. The judge-advocate denounced Rizal as a\r\ntraitor and an enemy to Spain. Extracts were read from his writings\r\nthat it was pretended had encouraged the existing revolt. The Christmas\r\nholidays intervened while the ghastly processes of slaughter were still\r\nincomplete. On December 29 the court found him guilty and sentenced him\r\nto be shot within twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nTo this and nothing else he had looked forward from the beginning of\r\nthe hearing. Some nights before the verdict, knowing well what it would\r\nbe, he had written in his cell by the light of his little alcohol lamp\r\nhis farewell to his country, his family, and his friends. It is that\r\npoem now become the national classic of the Philippines, the beautiful\r\nand tender elegy that he called “My Last Farewell.” On the last night\r\nhe folded the manuscript and hid it in the bowl of the lamp.\r\n\r\nOf this marvelous production, almost unequaled in literature for its\r\npathetic sincerity and noble feeling, there exist in English two\r\nversions. [213] That which seems the more adequately to express the\r\nthought of the original we offer here, and his must be a strangely\r\nindurated heart that can read it without emotion:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Land I adore, farewell! thou land of the southern sun’s choosing.\r\n  Pearl of the Orient seas! our forfeited Garden of Eden,\r\n  Joyous, I yield up for thee my sad life, and were it far brighter,\r\n  Young, or rose-strewn, for thee and thy happiness still would I\r\n                                                               give it.\r\n  Far afield, in the din and rush of maddening battle,\r\n  Others have laid down their lives, nor wavered, nor paused, in the\r\n                                                                giving.\r\n  What matters way or place—the cypress, the lily, the laurel,\r\n  Gibbet or open field, the sword or inglorious torture—\r\n  When ’tis the hearth and the country that call for the life’s\r\n                                                            immolation?\r\n\r\n  Dawn’s faint lights bar the east; she smiles through the cowl of\r\n                                                        the darkness,\r\n  Just as I die....\r\n  Vision I followed from afar, desire that spurred on and consumed me!\r\n  Greeting! my parting soul cries, and greeting again! O my country!\r\n  Beautiful is it to fall, that the vision may rise to fulfilment\r\n  Giving my life for thy life, and breathing thine air in the\r\n                                                           death-throe;\r\n  Sweet to eternally sleep in thy lap, O land of enchantment!\r\n\r\n  If in the deep rich grass that covers my rest in thy bosom,\r\n  Some day thou seest upspring a lowly tremulous blossom,\r\n  Lay there thy lips—’tis my soul!...\r\n\r\n  And if at eventide a soul for my tranquil sleep prayeth,\r\n  Pray thou, O my fatherland! for my peaceful reposing;\r\n  Pray for those who go down to death through unspeakable torments;\r\n  Pray for those who remain to suffer torture in prison;\r\n  Pray for the bitter grief of our mothers, our wives, our orphans;\r\n  Oh, pray, too, for thyself, on the way to thy final redemption!\r\n\r\n  When our still dwelling-place wraps night’s dusky mantle about her,\r\n  Leaving the dead alone with the dead, to watch till the morning,\r\n  Break not our rest, and seek not to lay death’s mystery open.\r\n  If now and then thou shouldst hear the string of a lute or a zithern,\r\n  Mine is the hand, dear country, and mine is the voice that is\r\n                                                               singing.\r\n\r\n  When my tomb, that all have forgot, no cross nor stone marketh,\r\n  There let the laborer guide his plow, there cleave the earth open.\r\n  So shall my ashes at last be one with thy hills and thy valleys.\r\n  Little ’t will matter, then, my country, that thou shouldst forget me!\r\n  I shall be air in thy streets, and I shall be space in thy meadows;\r\n  I shall be vibrant speech in thine ears, shall be fragrance and color,\r\n  Light and shout, and loved song, for ever repeating my message.\r\n\r\n  Idolized fatherland, thou crown and deep of my sorrows,\r\n  Lovely Philippine Isles, once again adieu! I am leaving\r\n  All with thee—my friends, my love. Where I go are no tyrants;\r\n  There one dies not for the cause of his faith; there God is the ruler.\r\n\r\n  Farewell, father and mother and brother, dear friends of the fireside!\r\n  Thankful ye should be for me that I rest at the end of the long day.\r\n  Farewell, sweet, from the stranger’s land—my joy and my comrade!\r\n  Farewell, dear ones, farewell! To die is to rest from our labors!\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore his murderers, before the jeers and savage exultations of the\r\nwell dressed mob clamoring for his death, throughout the hearing, at\r\nthe moment of the unjust verdict, he had maintained the same attitude\r\nof perfect serenity described as wonderful by all that observed it.\r\nOther condemned men have simulated this self-possession; this man had\r\nit in truth and not in seeming. Calmly he heard his condemnation,\r\ncalmly he reëntered the prison where for his last night on earth\r\nquarters had been made for him in the chapel. A newspaper reporter came\r\nto interview him. He was like a prosperous and well bred host\r\nentertaining a cultured friend; [214] no eyes, however searching, could\r\ndiscover a joint in that perfect armor of the soul sustained and\r\npossessed, without a tremor and without a gloomy thought. To the\r\nreporter and to others that had watched him this bearing seemed not\r\nbravado but something mystical and inexplicable, but it seemed so only\r\nbecause the source of it was beyond their understanding. He was calm\r\nbecause he had long before in effect given his life to this cause and\r\nthe shooting of the next day would be only the last incident in a\r\nsacrifice already made. Of this there is every indication. What men\r\ncall the joy of living had since his youth meant to him the joy of\r\nserving Filipinas. He seems to have had since the day of his exile to\r\nDapitan a feeling that in other ways his service [215] was at an end,\r\nbut there remained the service of his death. All the hard tests of life\r\nhad left him unshaken and uncorrupted, a man truly without fear and\r\nwithout reproach. With the same faultless and unpretentious courage he\r\nwalked forward to meet the end.\r\n\r\nAs was to have been expected in the conditions attending his fate, the\r\npower that had dragged him down with so much of trickery and deceit\r\nattempted to soil with other deceit the name he should leave to his\r\ncountrymen. To the newspaper reporter he said that “Noli Me Tangere”\r\nhad been much misunderstood because the authorities had selected from\r\nit only passages that seemed to indicate sacrilegious or seditious\r\npurpose, whereas when read in their proper places with the context they\r\nhad no such appearance. This statement was so distorted as to appear as\r\nan expression of regret that he had written the book. When he said that\r\nthe Republicans in Spain had mistaken their strength and their\r\nopportunities, this was distorted into a petulant charge that the\r\nSpanish Republicans had been the cause of all his troubles. When he\r\nspoke with characteristic modesty of his own work as feeble and of\r\nsmall avail, the remark was twisted into a dubiety of his basic faith.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to wrest from him something that could be called a\r\nretraction of his political opinions; even the last solemn offices of\r\nthe church were utilized toward an end so base. All his life he had\r\nremained a true Catholic, [216] despite his sharp condemnation of the\r\nfriars. He now desired to partake of the holy sacrament, and priests\r\nwere sent to him. What took place when they gathered around him was so\r\nperverted that no man may feel sure he has the truth of the story.\r\nAccording to one account the priests refused him the sacrament until\r\nthey should satisfy themselves of his orthodoxy, and a long examination\r\nfollowed. They demanded a signed statement affirming his belief in\r\nrevealed religion. He readily consented to give it; he could have given\r\nit truthfully at any time. Of this affirmation two irreconcilable\r\nversions were subsequently reported, a fact that dealing with a thing\r\nso simple must serve to discredit both. As to one, no other evidence is\r\nneeded than its style and content to show that Rizal never wrote it. As\r\nto the other reputed statement, opinions differ; reasonably, one might\r\nsay, since there is extant no original copy, and no one now pretends to\r\nhave seen such a copy. The style in the second statement is Rizal’s or\r\nan imitation of his; the expressions in it are in line with his general\r\nconvictions; [217] and if throughout this phase of the story we met\r\nwith less of manifest treachery and lying the probable authenticity of\r\nsome such declaration might well be admitted.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of evidence so untrustworthy the tale was fabricated that\r\nhe had retracted his political views. It was brazen impudence that put\r\nout this fable and simple credulity that believed it. Much that\r\nhappened in the last scenes of his tragedy is and always will be\r\nuncertain, but the one thing about which is no doubt is that he went to\r\nhis death unshaken in his loyalty to the great causes to which he had\r\ndedicated his life and labors, to the rights, emancipation, and\r\nprogress of his country.\r\n\r\nIf from the tangled accounts now available to us we wish to build a\r\nsurmise, it is likely that Rizal affirmed his religious faith,\r\nrenounced masonry, [218] was reconciled to the church, received the\r\nsacrament, and then had [219] performed the ecclesiastical marriage\r\nrites between him and his wife that he had so desired in vain at\r\nDapitan. Even as to this there is no record, but the correlative facts\r\nare strong. To his mother and sisters he now said the last farewell;\r\nsaid it with the calm and gentle resignation that from the first had\r\nmarked his conduct. Even in that crux of his sufferings his command\r\nupon himself and all his faculties seems never to have wavered. He knew\r\nwell that all his effects would be searched and any papers he might\r\nleave would be seized and destroyed; yet he desired to give to his\r\ncountrymen the song of parting he had written for them. At the\r\ninterview with his mother and sisters they were kept separated from him\r\nby a space of some feet under the pretended fear that poison might be\r\npassed to him and so might he cheat revenge of blood-drops for which it\r\nthirsted. To transmit the poem, therefore, was difficult, but the\r\nresourceful mind of Rizal did not fail him now. The little alcohol lamp\r\nby which he had written his song and read and studied in his cell had\r\nbeen the gift of a friend in Europe. In the Islands it was something of\r\na curiosity. This he managed to bequeath to his sister Trinidad and\r\nwhen he told her about it he added quickly in English, “There is\r\nsomething inside.” [220]\r\n\r\nEven in these last hours efforts were made by his friends to rescue him\r\nfrom the jaws that had opened to rend him. Relatives and friends\r\nbesieged the governor-general; he would not even admit them to his\r\npresence. In Spain fervent appeals were made to the National\r\nGovernment. All scientific and sympathetic Europe was horror-stricken\r\nat the impending murder of one of the most learned men of the age.\r\nThere is a story that the Spanish prime minister wished to yield to\r\nthese demands. It was the queen regent that he found implacable.\r\nSomething in one of Rizal’s books had mortally offended her. She, too,\r\nwas determined to have his blood.\r\n\r\nAll the hours of that night Rizal spent in prayer, in reading, and in\r\ncheerful conversation with his guards and the priests. He did not sleep\r\nand had no need of sleep. But his wakefulness was not of his nerves.\r\nNone of the watchers could detect a troubled look in his eyes or a\r\nquaver in the smooth, even tones of his voice. [221] Other men so\r\ncounting out the last moments of their lives have been mercifully\r\nsupplied with drugs and drink. The stimulus that sustained Rizal must\r\nhave been from within. So have testified the witnesses.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful morning, men still remember, calm, cool, and bright,\r\n“the bridal of the earth and sky,” typical of the sweet December\r\nweather in the Philippines; the air so clear the mountains on both\r\nsides stood out marvelously brown and rugged; so clear one could even\r\nmake out far Corregidor on guard at the entrance of the bay.\r\n\r\nAs day broke the crowds began to gather in the Luneta. Spaniards of the\r\nruling caste predominated, come to see the death of their enemy and\r\ngloat over him; but also there were Filipinos with drawn brows and\r\nquivering lips, disquieting to look upon. [222] In many Filipino houses\r\nthat last night there had been no sleep. Men and women prayed all night\r\nfor the man about to be slaughtered for their sake.\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock the troopers came and tightly bound his arms behind\r\nhis back. He wore a neat black suit with a sack-coat and a black hat.\r\n\r\nOutside, the trumpets sounded and the drums beat. The troopers placed\r\nhim in the center of a strong guard. Then they led him forth from the\r\nprison door.\r\n\r\nWith the drum always beating at the head of the band, thus he was\r\nmarched almost a mile through scenes that had been familiar to him in\r\nhis boyhood. Thirty-seven years and twenty-eight days before, another\r\nmartyr had gone forth to his death with the same clear-souled,\r\nuntroubled calm. “This is a beautiful country,” said John Brown,\r\nOsawatomie Brown, as with the sheriff he drove to the execution-place;\r\n“I never noticed it before.” With the same sense of drawing in for the\r\nlast time the breath of God’s bounty to men, Rizal looked about him and\r\nspoke of the loveliness of the scene. “I used to walk here with my\r\nsweetheart,” said he, thinking of Leonora. Above the roofs he saw the\r\nAteneo, where he had spent so many happy days. Since his time the\r\nbuildings had been altered. “When were those two towers added?” he\r\nasked and observed the effect with a critical eye. All the way he went\r\nwith head erect, unflushed cheek, unruffled mien, as one that goes\r\nforth to meet fair weather in the morning.\r\n\r\nBy his side marched the Jesuit priests, his comforters and supporters,\r\nfor he always remembered tenderly his days at the Ateneo.\r\n\r\n“We are going to Calvary,” he said to them. “My sufferings are little.\r\nThe Savior suffered much. He was nailed to the cross. In an instant the\r\nbullets will end all my pain.” [223]\r\n\r\nA crowd lined the street, for the most part silent, but among the\r\nSpaniards were some exclamations of joy. One foreigner, a Scotchman,\r\nwatching the scene, was moved to cry aloud a brief good-by. A little\r\ncompany of Rizal’s former students at Dapitan stood together and wept.\r\n\r\nHe looked out upon the bay and the ships.\r\n\r\n“How beautiful is the morning, Father! How clear is the view of\r\nCorregidor and the Cavite Mountains! I walked here with my sweetheart,\r\nLeonora, on mornings like this.”\r\n\r\n“The morning to be is still more beautiful, my son,” answered the\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n“Why is that, Father?” asked Rizal, not quite understanding his\r\nconfessor’s words.\r\n\r\nThe officer in charge of the squad stepped between them, and the\r\nfather’s reply was not heard.\r\n\r\nThus they moved to the place of execution, the dreadful Bagumbayan\r\nField, the spot where so many others had been slain for defying\r\ntyranny, where Fathers Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora had given up their\r\nlives. To their memory he had dedicated his protest against the beast\r\nthat had torn them. Now in his own turn he was come to be torn.\r\n\r\nA great troop of soldiers had formed a square to hold the people back.\r\nArtillery was drawn up as if a rescue were feared, and at one\r\nside—strange and incongruous spectacle!—a band to sound the national\r\nanthem of triumph over this one man. To the governing class the\r\noccasion was all holiday. Hundreds of that class stood there, men and\r\nwomen, and uttered cries of animal pleasure when they saw their enemy\r\ncome bound and helpless to be killed before their eyes.\r\n\r\nNeither they nor the engines of death they had evoked seemed to pierce\r\nthe serenity that wrapped him around. As they reached the field, he\r\nstopped before the captain in command and said quietly:\r\n\r\n“Will you shoot me in the front, please?”\r\n\r\n“It cannot be,” said the captain. “I have orders to shoot you in the\r\nback.”\r\n\r\n“But I was never traitor to my own country nor to Spain.”\r\n\r\n“My duty is to comply with the orders I have received.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then; shoot me as you please.” [224]\r\n\r\nHe asked that the soldiers be instructed to aim not at his head but his\r\nheart, and that he should not be compelled to kneel but might receive\r\nhis death standing. These requests the captain granted.\r\n\r\nInto the square he marched, between two batteries of artillery, a\r\ncompany of cavalry in front, another behind. With him still went the\r\npriests, Fathers Estanislao March and José Villaclara, and behind them\r\nthe man that had been his counsel in the mock trial, Luis de Andrade.\r\nRizal stepped to the place where he was to die and looked out over the\r\nblue sea, bright in the sunlight. And then for the first time the iron\r\ncomposure seemed shaken. It may have been some thought of his lost\r\nyouth, or the terror of the scene that reached out at him like\r\nsomething coldly palpable. A shiver seemed to go over him; the mortal\r\nman that he had so long suppressed in him reasserted itself; and one\r\ngreat sigh seemed to burst from his heart.\r\n\r\n“O Father, how terrible it is to die! How one suffers! Father, I\r\nforgive every one from the bottom of my heart; I have no resentment\r\nagainst any one: believe me, your reverence!”\r\n\r\nThe next instant the spasm had passed. The will with which he had ruled\r\nhimself so long came back to its accustomed empire. He was himself\r\nagain and stood erect, with no twitching of his lips and no fear in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe executioners marched upon the field.\r\n\r\nRizal shook hands firmly with the priests and with his counsel. Father\r\nMarch held to him the cross for him to kiss.\r\n\r\nHe now turned his face to the east and stood with his back to the\r\nfiring-squad. Eight native soldiers had been told off to slay their\r\nfellow-countryman. Behind them were eight Spanish soldiers with leveled\r\nrifles. They were to shoot the executioners if these failed to obey\r\norders.\r\n\r\nRizal stood with his eyes open and turned toward the sky. In his face,\r\nit is said, was neither ecstasy nor fear, but only the calm of a\r\nperfect resignation. Often he had said: “What is death to me? I have\r\nsown the seed; others are left to reap.” [225] The testing of that word\r\nhad come. It found him ready and undismayed.\r\n\r\nAt that instant a military doctor, amazed by such a show of fortitude,\r\nran out from the line of officers.\r\n\r\n“Colleague,” he cried, “may I feel your pulse?”\r\n\r\nRizal said nothing but thrust his right hand as far as he could from\r\nthe bands that held it.\r\n\r\nThe pulse was hardly a beat above normal.\r\n\r\n“You are well, colleague,” said the doctor, “very well!” and stepped\r\nback to his place.\r\n\r\nRizal made no response and resumed his former attitude. He now twisted\r\nhis right hand and indicated the spot in his back at which the soldiers\r\nshould aim.\r\n\r\nThe captain gave the signal. The eight soldiers fired together.\r\n\r\nThe body of Rizal was seen to waver and fall. With a last effort of his\r\nindomitable will, even in falling he turned so that he should lie with\r\nface upward. [226]\r\n\r\nIn the thirty-sixth year of his age and the twenty-fourth year of his\r\nservice—poet, patriot, and martyr.\r\n\r\nCheers and laughter arose from the crowd as his blood was seen to be\r\npouring upon the field. Women waved their handkerchiefs and clapped\r\ntheir hands; men shouted with delight. This was the end of him that had\r\nunveiled to the world the realities of their social order; that had\r\nridiculed all their structure of rank and caste. He had died like a dog\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nThe band played the national anthem. “Viva España!” shouted the crowd.\r\nA photographer made pictures of the scene. It was a great day for\r\nSpain. Her supremacy in the Philippines was approved and established\r\nfor ever. For whomsoever thereafter might venture to question its\r\nrighteousness, the same fate. Let him also die like a dog to the\r\napplause and laughter of the existing order, rock-rooted and eternal.\r\n\r\n“Viva España!” How poor are they that will not ponder history! From the\r\nhanging of John Brown to the Emancipation Proclamation was three years\r\nand twenty-nine days. From the murder of José Rizal to the surrender of\r\nManila was one year, eight months, and seventeen days.\r\n\r\nThe body was cast into an undesignated grave, and great care was taken\r\nto obliterate all marks by which it might be identified; for this hated\r\nenemy there should be nothing but loathing and contumely, alive or\r\ndead. The perpetrators of this last outrage believed they had managed\r\nwith skill and success. Little they knew the people with whom they\r\ndealt. Into the unmarked grave were covertly introduced objects that\r\nwould allow of a future identification, [227] and the dust that malice\r\nand bigotry sought to dishonor was destined to a final burial with the\r\nproud mourning of a nation and the respectful sympathy of the world.\r\n\r\nNot even yet was satiated the hot thirst for blood that seemed to rage\r\nin this abnormal community. The jails had been stuffed with other\r\nmembers of the Liga Filipina, men that like Rizal had committed the\r\ncrime of desiring their country’s good. On January 11, 1897, two weeks\r\nafter the sacrifice of Rizal, fourteen of his companions were led forth\r\nto Bagumbayan Field and shot, as he had been shot. Two of these were\r\npriests of the church; among the laymen were members of ancient\r\nFilipino families, and men of conspicuously blameless walk and notable\r\nattainments. Father Inocencio Herrera and Father Prieto Gerónimo led\r\nthe procession of the condemned whose names were now to be added to the\r\nlong roll of those that had made that one field a shrine of liberty\r\nhardly to be equaled in men’s acquaintance. Others whose blood was shed\r\nwith theirs that day on that sacred spot were Domingo Franco, Moisés\r\nSalvador, Numeriano Adriano, Antonio Salazar, José Dizon, Luis Enciso\r\nVillareal, Faustino Villareal, Ramón A. Padilla, Manuel Avella, Roman\r\nBasa, Cristobal Medina, and Francisco Roxas. It was a flag dripping\r\nwith blood that Spain raised to the world that morning.\r\n\r\nOf these some had endured such torturings that death must have come as\r\na relief. Neither age nor worth to be spared, was the ancestral precept\r\nfor all such butcheries. Moisés Salvador was more than seventy years\r\nold. He had been tortured until he could no longer stand and must be\r\ncarried out and laid prone on the ground when his time came to be shot.\r\nFrancisco Roxas the thumb-screw, or whatever other deviltries, had made\r\ninsane. He knew nothing of what was going on about him but imagined\r\nhimself to be in church. When he knelt before the firing-squad he\r\nspread his handkerchief upon the ground as he would upon the church\r\nfloor and began to say his ordinary prayers. [228]\r\n\r\n“Viva España!” There never was a grimmer irony of fate. Even as the\r\ncrowds raised that cry above the blood of Rizal, in all the Far East\r\nthere was no more Spain. The band that played triumphant the national\r\nanthem was in reality sounding a funeral dirge. The shots that struck\r\ndown Rizal to the cheers of “broadcloth ruffians” shattered the Spanish\r\nempire. Until that December 30, 1896, there remained just basis for the\r\nancient boast about the flag whereon the sun never set; as Rizal\r\ntottered and fell it passed among the curios of history. On the day the\r\nmurderous court martial pronounced Rizal’s death the Filipinos began to\r\nslip from the city and join the forces of Bonifacio. Among them that\r\nevening went Paciano, men said with pinched lips and clenched jaws, to\r\nfight with conspicuous valor while the Spanish flag flew in his\r\ncountry. [229] Silently they went and by thousands. The insurgent lines\r\nswept up as close as Cavite, so strong had the uprising grown. There,\r\nin the face of all the vigilance, all the spying, all the rules and\r\nregulations, they stood in their trenches with arms in their hands.\r\nGuns came from the thickets, the roofs, the carabao stalls. Soldiers\r\nthat enlisted without rifles fought with bolos until in the first\r\nencounter they could wrest guns from the Spaniards. From the waterfront\r\nof Manila one could see their flag flying. Inadequately armed, badly\r\nfed, ragged and untrained, they went into battle and overwhelmed the\r\nSpanish regulars, because they had been fired with a vision of freedom\r\nand a holy wrath against the System that had struck down their\r\nchampion. Back went the Spanish regulars to the gates of Manila, as one\r\nhundred years before the household troops of every king in Europe had\r\nbent before the citizen soldiery of France, fighting for the republic.\r\n\r\nIn a short time there was left no last doubt of the seriousness of the\r\nrevolt; with reason this time the Spanish colony cowered. The\r\nthirty-fourth since the beginning of Spanish dominion in the\r\nPhilippines, it threatened at last to sweep that vicious anomaly into\r\nthe sea. A man had arisen capable of verifying the most sanguine of\r\nBonifacio’s prophecies, a college-bred farmer, without military\r\ntraining but with a strange gift of military prescience, able with an\r\nequipment of native genius to outwit, outmanœuver, and outlast the best\r\nof the Spanish commanders. Against the skill and restless energy of\r\nEmilio Aguinaldo they seemed to make no permanent progress, and one\r\nreading the records of those days is irresistibly reminded of Francis\r\nMarion and the Carolinas. If the regulars drove him hence to-day, he\r\nwould attack them there to-morrow. A union of Filipino hearts such as\r\nRizal, living, had hardly dared to dream of had been cemented by his\r\ndeath. For the first time the possibility of ridding all the Islands of\r\nall Spanish power laid hold upon determined and reasoning men, and\r\nthere began a life and death struggle between light and darkness, the\r\nnineteenth century and the sixteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND INFLUENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this long conflict character shone forth and latent ability,\r\nrefuting old slanders on the race. The Filipino disclosed himself. By\r\nancient repute the Malayan was cruel and treacherous; the test of\r\nwarfare showed him to be much more humane than the Spaniard and much\r\nmore sensible of honor and faith. He had been described as incapable of\r\ncombined and sustained activities; he revealed himself as organizing a\r\ngovernment out of chaos, coördinating the energies of peoples unused to\r\ncommon effort, launching a democracy founded upon the most advanced\r\nideas of political philosophy, defending it with skill and tenacious\r\ncourage comparable to the best traditions of the Swiss mountaineers.\r\nMen whose talents had never been suspected because they had never had a\r\nchance to function arose in the Filipino ranks to astonish their\r\nenemies and overwhelm prejudice. Great commanders appeared like Luna\r\nand del Pilar; statesmen and thinkers like Felipe Calderon; and\r\nprofoundly philosophical and illuminating intellects like Apolinario\r\nMabini.\r\n\r\nNext to Rizal himself, this was the greatest genius the Islands had\r\nproduced and one that would have deserved eminence in any country or\r\nany time. He was come of poor people in the province of Batangas and\r\nhad won an education partly through the pathetic sacrifices of his\r\nmother and partly through his own exertions, which in that time and\r\nplace amounted to heroism. He was first in a school at Tanauan and then\r\nat the College of San Juan de Letran in Manila, where he earned his way\r\nby teaching. His mother’s hope had been that he would take holy orders;\r\nbut his studies had made him skeptical instead of reverent; he revolted\r\nat the priesthood, and chose the bar, to which he was admitted in 1894.\r\n\r\nLike Bonifacio he was a great reader, but on different lines. The\r\nwarehouse porter, hanging by night over such books as he could lay\r\nhands upon, was set aflame by the struggles of mankind against\r\noppression, particularly by that which is the epitome and symbol of\r\nthem all, the French Revolution. Mabini, cool and even-pulsed\r\nphilosopher, was concerned not so much with the physical aspects of\r\nrevolution as with its causes. If the human story told true,\r\nrevolutions were some rebound of the spirit of man against a privileged\r\nclass that held or sought to hold the rest as bondmen. As this conflict\r\nbetween two main forces occupied so much of the history he was\r\nanalyzing with his keen sure mind, and as it seemed the only thing\r\nthere of enduring importance, he molded from its pages a philosophy of\r\nhuman life and its import not unworthy of Jefferson and Mill. The basis\r\nof everything good he conceived to be liberty; without liberty there\r\ncould be no light and no progress. With a coolly measuring eye, as an\r\narchitect looks at a building, he went over the system of government\r\nerected by Spain in the Philippines and estimated its fatal defects as\r\na structure no longer tenable, knowing well that its fall was overdue.\r\n\r\nMuch more than Rizal he seems to have seized the fundamental facts\r\nabout man’s capacity for self-government and the only way to uncover\r\nand develop that capacity. He, too, was of the cloister, and might have\r\nslipped likewise into the darling errors of the schoolmen about the\r\nmagic keys to this wisdom believed to be buried in a classical\r\neducation. He made no such error. Not even Jefferson was of a clearer\r\nfaith. He accepted the whole democratic theory of government, not\r\nsentimentally but as the ultimate fact in human existence. On\r\nphilosophical grounds, for unassailable reasons, popular rule was\r\nright; in the end the only human wisdom was the general thought. In the\r\nverdict of the majority he saw plainly the manifestation of the will of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nHe was not influenced by Bonifacio, of whose existence he seems to have\r\nbeen unaware until 1892. As one of the earliest members of La Líga\r\nFilipina he may have been influenced at one time by Rizal; but there\r\nwas little chance and less need that he should be influenced by\r\nanybody. His was a mind accustomed to independent action; it seems\r\nalways to have moved to its own conclusions in its own way.\r\n\r\nHe was an early recruit to the Katipunan, where, after a time, he\r\nbecame one of Bonifacio’s chief advisers. A stroke of paralysis\r\ncrippled his body but left his mind clear and active. When the storm\r\nburst and official lunacy raged in Manila, his physical infirmities\r\nprevented his flight with his fellows. Trapped among other\r\nunfortunates, a drum-head doomed him to be shot. It is likely the\r\nGovernment knew little of his real connection with the Katipunan and\r\nnothing of his capacity to cause trouble. The sentence of death upon\r\nhim was delayed. At last, homicidal mania spent itself even in Manila.\r\nThen, because of his physical condition, he was set at liberty.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1897, when revolution had changed all the outlook in the\r\nPhilippines and the governing class was beginning to doubt its destiny.\r\nFor the next year he was undergoing medical treatment at the hot\r\nsprings of Los Baños. In the summer of 1898 he made his way to the\r\nrevolutionary forces and was thereafter their ablest counselor, the\r\nshrewd adviser of the commanders in the field, the first voice in all\r\nnegotiations, and to the masses of people the endless source of\r\ninspiration; for in all emergencies, however sudden or perplexing, here\r\nwas the heart indomitable.\r\n\r\nIn him as in Rizal, the mysteries of an unusual power resolve\r\nthemselves at last into unusual character. What was Mabini’s character\r\nmay be gathered from this decalogue he composed for his own guidance\r\nand that of his countrymen:\r\n\r\n\r\n    First. Thou shalt love God and thine honor above all things; God as\r\n    the fountain of all truth, of all justice, and of all activity; and\r\n    thine honor, the only power that will oblige thee to be faithful,\r\n    just, and industrious.\r\n\r\n    Second. Thou shalt worship God in the form that thy conscience may\r\n    deem most righteous and worthy; for in thy conscience, which\r\n    condemns thine evil deeds and praises thy good ones, speaks thy\r\n    God.\r\n\r\n    Third. Thou shalt cultivate the special gifts that God has granted\r\n    thee, working and studying according to thine ability, never\r\n    leaving the path of righteousness and justice, in order to attain\r\n    to thine own perfection, by means whereof thou shalt contribute to\r\n    the progress of humanity. Thus thou shalt fulfil the mission to\r\n    which God has appointed thee, and by so doing thou shalt be\r\n    honored, and, being honored, thou shalt glorify thy God.\r\n\r\n    Fourth. Thou shalt love thy country after God and thine honor and\r\n    more than thyself: for she is the only paradise which God has given\r\n    thee in this life, the only patrimony of thy race, the only\r\n    inheritance of thine ancestors, and the only hope of thy posterity;\r\n    because of her, thou hast life, love, and interests, happiness,\r\n    honor, and God.\r\n\r\n    Fifth. Thou shalt strive for the happiness of thy country before\r\n    thine own, making of her the kingdom of reason, of justice, and of\r\n    labor; for if she be happy, thou, together with thy family, shalt\r\n    likewise be happy.\r\n\r\n    Sixth. Thou shalt strive for the independence of thy country; for\r\n    only thou canst have any real interest in her advancement and\r\n    exaltation, because her independence constitutes thine own liberty;\r\n    her advancement, thy perfection; and her exaltation, thine own\r\n    glory and immortality.\r\n\r\n    Seventh. Thou shalt not recognize in thy country the authority of\r\n    any person that has not been elected by thee and thy countrymen;\r\n    for authority emanates from God, and as God speaks in the\r\n    conscience of every man, the person designated and proclaimed by\r\n    the conscience of a whole people is the only one that can use true\r\n    authority.\r\n\r\n    Eighth. Thou shalt strive for a republic and never for a monarchy\r\n    in the country; for the latter exalts one or several families and\r\n    founds a dynasty; the former makes a people noble and worthy\r\n    through reason, great through liberty, and prosperous and brilliant\r\n    through labor.\r\n\r\n    Ninth. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself; for God has imposed\r\n    upon him the obligation to help thee, as upon thee the obligation\r\n    to help him, and not to do to thee what he would not have thee do\r\n    unto him; but if thy neighbor, failing in this sacred duty, attempt\r\n    against thy life, thy liberty, and thy interests, then thou shalt\r\n    destroy and annihilate him, for the supreme law of\r\n    self-preservation prevails.\r\n\r\n    Tenth. Thou shalt consider thy countryman as more than thy\r\n    neighbor; thou shalt see in him thy friend, thy brother, or at\r\n    least thy comrade, with whom thou art bound by one fate, by the\r\n    same joys and sorrows, and by common aspirations and interests.\r\n\r\n    Therefore, as long as national frontiers subsist, raised and\r\n    maintained by the selfishness of race and of family, with thy\r\n    countryman alone shalt thou unite in a perfect solidarity of\r\n    purpose and interest, in order to have force, not only to resist\r\n    the common enemy but also to attain all the aims of human life.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime, in the great events that had shaken this ancient theater of\r\nbold deeds, the freedom of which Mabini and his fellows had dreamed had\r\nmore than once lightened before them. With the news of the discovery of\r\nthe Katipunan and the cruelties of the hysteria in high places that\r\nfollowed next, the revolution spread swiftly to the provinces. Cavite,\r\nBatangas, Zambales, Tarlac rose as the clans rose in Scotland; a\r\nremarkable fact, for here had been no preparation, and the Katipunan\r\nhad not gone far beyond Manila walls. Nothing would seem to show more\r\nplainly that the psychology of the people had been all misread. At\r\nRizal’s school he had noticed that the Spaniards deemed the natives\r\nsubmissive to kicks and insults when in reality wrath burned in the\r\nnative heart. It was so here; while the “miserable Indio” had borne in\r\nsilence the lash of the governing class he had not ceased at any time\r\nto resent its sting, and at the first call to revolt the whole Island\r\nwent aflame. In a week the comfortable fictions about Filipino\r\nincapacity were shattered by such ponderable facts as shot and shell,\r\nand Spain was retreating before the gravest crisis it had known in its\r\n325 years of mismanagement.\r\n\r\nBonifacio’s forces increased daily. He gave battle to the regular\r\ntroops sent against him and sometimes he beat them, sometimes he was\r\nbeaten; but never was he dismayed. He developed captains among the\r\nyoung men that flocked around him; with others, this Emilio Aguinaldo\r\nof whom we have spoken. This was a youth lately out of college that had\r\nnever set a squadron in the field nor the divisions of a battle knew\r\nmore than Cassio. Yet he quickly showed such natural talents for\r\ncommand that he made his fame enduring among the military leaders of\r\nall times. He was born in the city of Cavite in March, 1869, and had\r\nstudied at the College of San Juan with no more thought of being a\r\nsoldier than of being a chiropodist. He had read his horoscope in the\r\nface of fate and perceived that he was to be a farmer and lead a quiet\r\nlife among dingles and rice-plots. No sooner had he fingered his degree\r\nat San Juan than he hastened to fulfil this modest destiny by taking a\r\nfarm in Cavite province and trying to better the yield of rice there.\r\nHe had character, a presence, and a good mind; he had not been farming\r\nlong when he was made municipal captain of his district. From his youth\r\nhe seems to have been strong for nationalism, being a type of the class\r\nof young men rising in all parts of the Islands on whom the Spanish\r\ncollar rested uneasily if at all, the class of which Rizal was the best\r\nexample and natural leader. In 1894 he joined the Katipunan. When\r\nFather Gil pulled the strings and revealed, to the fevered imagination\r\nof the Spaniards, the lair of this frightful monster, Aguinaldo was one\r\nof the first to proclaim the revolution. Chiefly it was his work that\r\nmade Cavite an insurrectionary stronghold. In whatever he undertook he\r\nshowed the executive faculty, the power to get things done quickly and\r\nefficiently, and a cool, hardy courage that no emergency could shake.\r\nBonifacio advanced him to the highest commands, and in each instance\r\nthe result justified the election, for the man had undoubtedly an\r\ninstinct for war.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, 1897, seven months after the Katipunan explosion, a\r\nconvention of the revolutionists met to establish a Provisional\r\nGovernment. No doubt Bonifacio, still head of the Katipunan, expected\r\nto be made president of the Provisional Republic, also; but the\r\nconvention’s choice was Aguinaldo. Intrigue may have played some part\r\nin this dénouement; but the impulse to it was Aguinaldo’s brilliant\r\noperations in the field—Napoleon and the Directoire again. Bonifacio\r\nwas offered the place of secretary of the interior. He angrily refused\r\nit and took to the mountains with his brothers. In trying to arrest him\r\na party of soldiers wounded him to death.\r\n\r\nFor months the war was fought with varying chances. Sometimes the\r\nFilipinos routed the Spaniards; [230] sometimes they were driven back.\r\nFresh troops came from Spain; gradually the revolutionists retired into\r\nthe mountains; but it was evident that no forces the Spaniards were\r\nlikely to gather would be enough to suppress this uprising. What Spain\r\nfaced was such years of wearying warfare as had drained her treasury\r\nand brought her shame in Cuba. It was a prospect the Government viewed\r\nwith no satisfaction. Another governor-general, Primo de Rivera, came\r\nout to take the place of Polavieja, the foolish man that had led the\r\nmad hunt after Katipunanists. Once before de Rivera had been\r\ngovernor-general; by some extravagance he was believed to understand\r\nthe Filipinos and to be their friend. He now sought to end a strife so\r\nunpromising of any result except deficits. A meeting was arranged with\r\nthe insurgent chiefs, at which a treaty [231] was patched together\r\nwhereby the Filipinos were to have all the reforms and rights they had\r\ndemanded and had fought for, except actual independence. When we come\r\nto look to-day at these sweeping changes we should note that prominent\r\namong them was the triumph of the people so long delayed over the\r\norders. These were to be expelled or secularized. [232] Complete\r\nreligious freedom was explicitly guaranteed—and no more friars, no more\r\nSystem. By this token it would seem, then, that Rizal had already\r\nconquered. He exposed the orders; the orders killed him, but apparently\r\nwrought thereby their own ruin.\r\n\r\nAmnesty for all that had taken part in the revolution was promised,\r\nwith momentous changes in the methods of government. There was to be no\r\nlonger an irresponsible oligarchy ruling as it pleased; the Philippines\r\nwere to have representation in the Spanish Parliament; they were to\r\nemerge from the darkness that fostered iniquity and dwell in the\r\ncritical spotlights of civilization. There was to be a free press, free\r\nspeech, free assembly; there were to be radical reforms in the courts\r\nand other desirable novelties. A sum of money was to be deposited by\r\nthe Spanish Government to guarantee the fulfilment of these pledges and\r\nto provide for the families of the revolutionists killed in the war.\r\nAguinaldo and his commanders were to retire from the country.\r\n\r\nThis was signed December 14, 1897. In two months it was evident that\r\nthe Spanish Government had no intention to keep any of the pledges thus\r\nmade. The orders abated nothing of their power and insolence; the\r\ncaptured revolutionists were rigorously punished and often horribly\r\nmishandled; there was no free speech, no free press; no improvements\r\nwere made in the courts; only a part of the guarantee fund was\r\ndeposited. The revolution was resumed with new fury. Again the\r\nFilipinos drove the Spanish regulars before them until the noise of\r\ntheir guns was heard in Manila itself, when the blowing up of the\r\nAmerican battle-ship Maine in the harbor of Havana gave to the\r\nrelations between Spain and the United States a new and startling\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nSoon after the declaration of war between these nations and before the\r\nbattle of Manila Bay, Commodore Dewey invited Aguinaldo to join him. On\r\nMay 11, 1898, the Filipino leader landed at Cavite and took command of\r\nthe insurgent army. From that time the Spanish troops met with nothing\r\nbut disaster. Step by step they were driven (by native troops and these\r\nonly) out of every stronghold, not only in Luzon but in the other\r\nIslands, until August when they were shut up in Manila and completely\r\nsurrounded with Filipino trenches, while Dewey’s ships held the sea\r\napproaches. On August 10, Aguinaldo captured the Manila waterworks, and\r\nhad the city at his mercy. On August 13 it surrendered, not to him that\r\nreally had reduced it, but to the American naval and land forces;\r\nalthough of such land forces there was but a handful.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo had made Mabini the president of his council and secretary of\r\nforeign affairs. Mabini now bent himself to organize a constitutional\r\ngovernment, and if the achievement that followed had been staged nearer\r\nto the center of the world’s attention it would have been hailed as a\r\ntriumph of constructive statesmanship. On September 15, the first\r\nPhilippine Congress met at Malolos, about twenty-five miles north of\r\nManila, and proceeded to draft for the Philippine Republic a\r\nconstitution that for wisdom and sound democratic philosophy may be\r\ncompared with any other similar chart by which any government ever was\r\nsteered. On November 29, 1898, the Congress adopted this constitution,\r\nand on the following January 21, the Philippine Republic, complete and\r\nfunctioning, was installed in place of the Provisional Government.\r\nMabini was chief justice of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe United States refused to recognize the new republic, but, in\r\naccordance with the absurd treaty of Paris, insisted upon its own\r\nsovereignty over all the Philippines. For twenty million dollars it had\r\nbought of Spain a title that Spain did not possess. We need not dwell\r\nlong on the deplorable strife that now ensued between the American and\r\nFilipino forces. [233] On February 4, the Americans advanced into\r\nterritory held by the Filipino army, and for the next two years war\r\nraged. The Filipinos, although badly armed and always outnumbered,\r\nshowed a tenacity, a courage, and a military prowess that continually\r\nastonished the Americans and won their candid and reiterated praise.\r\nMuch of the credit for the skilful handling of the Filipino forces was\r\ndue to General Antonio Luna, Aguinaldo’s chief of staff, whose natural\r\naptitude for arms had been developed by study in the best schools of\r\nEurope. When he lost his life in June, 1899, the Filipino cause\r\nsuffered a heavy blow, but not so heavy as its enemies expected. For\r\nthe singular fact was to be noted that out of the body of natives once\r\ndespised and scornfully classed as “brethren of the water-buffalo”\r\narose men capable of inspiring the soldiers of a hopeless cause and of\r\nleading them well in desperately fought battles. If for the moment we\r\ncan lay aside nationalistic consciousness, the dauntless strivings of\r\nthe Filipinos against the Americans will appear worthy of a place in\r\nbest records of the struggles of the weak against the strong.\r\n\r\nOn March 23, 1901, President Aguinaldo was captured, and thereafter the\r\nwar slowly subsided until on July 4, 1902, President Roosevelt issued a\r\nproclamation of amnesty and the American Government took up the work of\r\nreconstruction, of which the first purpose was to prepare the natives\r\nfor the independence repeatedly promised them.\r\n\r\nReviewing this chapter (none too edifying) in American history, one\r\ncannot well escape the feeling that the American success was stained\r\nwith a needlessly harsh treatment of Mabini, the Thomas Jefferson of\r\nthe Filipino cause. The American forces captured him in September,\r\n1899, and kept him in prison for a year. He had been at liberty a scant\r\nsix months when he was arrested again and carried a prisoner to Guam,\r\n[234] where he was kept two years, returning home to die. While he was\r\nunder examination by American army officers, occurred a characteristic\r\npassage. He was asked if he had heard any one talking in favor of\r\nPhilippine independence.\r\n\r\n“I have,” said Mabini, speaking always in the same low, even voice.\r\n\r\n“Whom have you heard?”\r\n\r\n“Myself.”\r\n\r\n“What? Are you opposed to the rule of the United States in the\r\nPhilippines?”\r\n\r\n“I certainly am. I am opposed to the rule of any power here except that\r\nof the people of these Islands. If you wish to shoot somebody for\r\nholding such sentiments, shoot me. Do not shoot or imprison those to\r\nwhom I have urged this doctrine; do not waste time in hunting for them.\r\nShoot me, the author of it. I am ready whenever you are.”\r\n\r\nHe died in Manila, May 13, 1903. Next to that of Rizal, his memory is\r\ndearest to the Filipino people.\r\n\r\nThe historian and the philosopher considering these typical passages in\r\nthe long struggle upward will see that, while ostensibly the Philippine\r\nRepublic had been defeated, in reality it had triumphed. Instead of\r\nbeing crushed and obliterated, it had never ceased to exist. To this\r\nday it is not a memory but a living organism of veritable and powerful\r\ninfluence. Its flag flies side by side with that of the United States\r\non every public building; it functions in effect in every session of\r\nthe Philippine legislature. So far as one can see now it was a\r\ndeathless creation that Rizal unconsciously called into being, and\r\nthere could be no more impressive lesson in the inevitable destiny of\r\ndemocracy than the reflection that the cruelties intended to destroy\r\nfreedom in the Philippines really gave to it enduring life. When so\r\neasily the governing class shattered Rizal’s body and silenced his\r\nphysical voice, it did but give wings to his teachings, vindicating\r\nthem at once and multiplying them. If the result is not yet complete\r\nand the Philippines lack still their national entity, no one that knows\r\ntheir people and no one that has studied attentively the significance\r\nthe life and death of Rizal have for them will believe that this\r\nanomaly can continue. They live now under the solemn undertaking of the\r\nUnited States to set them free; that pledge they have accepted at its\r\nface-value; from day to day they continue in expectation of its\r\nfulfilment.\r\n\r\nIn such strange and fateful ways of which he never dreamed, Rizal has\r\ncome to be the liberator of his country and the inspiration of its\r\nnational life. It is a story so different from any other in the records\r\nof the human advance that it may be deemed worth the world’s attention\r\non its own account. With arms and conflict Washington and the other\r\npatriots of his time freed America, Bolivar and San Martin freed South\r\nAmerica, Garibaldi and Mazzini freed Italy. With an idea and an ideal\r\nRizal freed the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe more his brief career is studied the more it appears as apart from\r\nthe ordinary aims and walks of men—singular, selfless, and admirable.\r\nIf while he lived he had little recognition worthy of his great\r\nattainments, the veneration of his countrymen since his death has\r\natoned for all former indifference anywhere. For the term of Spain’s\r\ndominion and a short time thereafter his dust remained obscurely\r\nburied. [235] When peace had come between the Americans and Filipinos\r\nboth began to pay tribute to his memory. The body was disinterred from\r\nits nameless grave and reburied with high honors, civic and military.\r\nWhen the Filipinos came to have a measure of control over their own\r\naffairs they made a new province of the region around Manila, including\r\nCalamba, and named it Rizal. The anniversary of his death they made the\r\nnational holy day. On the spot where he was killed they erected a\r\nmagnificent monument, a stately and worthy memorial. Elsewhere they\r\nmultiplied the tributes to his fame until by 1921 scarcely a\r\nconsiderable town in the Philippines was without his statue or bust or\r\nsome commemoration of his story. Of the ground he had tilled in\r\nDapitan, surrounding the little house where he had taught his school, a\r\nnational park was made. In his honor the waterworks he had engineered\r\nwere extended and perpetuated. From every available source the\r\nGovernment collected, often at great cost, the relics of his physical\r\nexistence. [236]\r\n\r\nEach return of Rizal day is marked with elaborate ceremonies; addresses\r\nare delivered to his memory; the schools hold special exercises; the\r\npress reviews his life and dwells upon its import. Year by year the\r\nearnestness of these tributes increases. Other men, as their tangible\r\npresence recedes, become more or less the lay figures of history. This\r\nman seems to become with time only the more potent and real.\r\n\r\nHappy should be the land that has such a national hero, in whom the\r\npitiless searchings of later years have not discovered enough of flaw\r\nto discredit any part of the homage paid him but instead cause him to\r\nappear always the more imposing figure, morally as well as\r\nintellectually. It is but truth to say that his analogue is hard to\r\nfind in any nation of any color at any period of history. He had, what\r\nis so seldom to be found in the men we call great, a union of brilliant\r\ngifts and of lofty character. Of him it is never necessary to offer the\r\nBaconian apology; he was of the brightest and wisest of mankind but\r\nwithout an alloying trace of the mean.\r\n\r\nIntellectually, there is no doubt he deserved the praise paid\r\nwonderingly to him by Sir Hugh Clifford and others; he was a master\r\nfigure. To the capacity of his mind there seemed no normal limit; he\r\ncould comprehend any subject, learn any craft, acquire any language,\r\nabsorb any science. It seemed to be a mind of the order of Octopi, with\r\ntentacles that reached out and pumped up not the superficies but the\r\nheart of the matter. Hence he could out-argue the learned theologians\r\nwith the most abstruse lore of their cult, discuss with the artists the\r\nrecondite principles of their art, classify for entomologists and\r\nzoölogists unheard-of specimens of life, thread with economists the\r\nendless mazes of theoretical taxation, write exquisite lyrics and sing\r\nthem to music of his own composing. Such are the facts of his life,\r\nhowever reluctant prejudice may be to acknowledge them. If there has\r\nyet appeared upon this earth what may be justly called a universal\r\ngenius, it seems from the records that he was not of the white race,\r\nthe world’s confident overlords, but of the misunderstood Malay.\r\n\r\nSo slowly we yield to truth when it runs counter to theories that it\r\nmay be advisable to dwell for another moment on this man’s indisputable\r\nachievements. Let us say, then, that to have attained to his mastery of\r\nany two of the branches of knowledge he followed would have deserved\r\ndistinction; yet he attained to this mastery in six or seven. He was\r\none of the greatest ophthalmologists of his time; he was a great\r\nethnologist, anthropologist, biologist, zoölogist, linguist; he was\r\nsculptor, painter, illustrator, poet, novelist, publicist, engineer,\r\neducator, reformer. With almost any of these gifts or accomplishments\r\nor whatever they may be termed, he could have won to eminence or to\r\nwealth anywhere among civilized men. He is almost the only example we\r\nhave of a man marvelously endowed for material success and putting it\r\nall aside and every thought of it; putting aside, too, even the natural\r\nyearning for renown, that he might give himself entirely to the one end\r\nof benefiting his people.\r\n\r\nOf the veritable basis for these conclusions, so strange in an age and\r\na world that makes of disillusion a fetish, no fair-minded inquirer can\r\nhave a doubt. It is but the truth that Rizal’s private life has endured\r\nthe touch as surely as his public career. [237] That government of\r\nhimself he began to learn at the Ateneo, that scorn of the revolt of\r\nflesh and fierce determination to put it under the dominion of spirit,\r\nhe diligently fostered all his life. He had controversies and disputes;\r\nhe even had quarrels (as we have seen) that might have had deadly\r\noutcome; it appears that he did not in any of these lose the perfect\r\ncontrol of his temper. The contagion of the world’s slow stain never\r\ncame near him. He looked upon life and all its phases with a coolly\r\nreasoned disdain of all things false. A hundred times he might have\r\nsaved himself with one only step that the world would have applauded;\r\nhe would not take that step because it would mean a compromise with the\r\nstern, iron-bound Puritan-like standard of virtue he had chosen for\r\nhimself. No instance has been discovered in him of lies or\r\nequivocation. As he himself declared, he had his full share of human\r\nfrailties and failings, but he managed to avoid those that scar the\r\nsoul. Some of his jests, it is true, verged upon practical joking, the\r\nusual contradiction in men of a melancholy inclining. The wisdom of his\r\nmarriage, for reasons that need not be gone into here, is now rather\r\nmore than questionable. On the subject of the capacity of the Filipinos\r\nfor immediate self-government in his own time, it seems to us clear he\r\nwas gravely in error. Of the necessity of higher education as a\r\nfoundation for independence he made far too much. When he held that\r\nreforms must needs come from above and could not be expected to be\r\nmoved from below he must have overlooked some sure lessons of history.\r\nThat naïve notion of his earlier years, that Spain would for the asking\r\nsupplant exploitation with altruism was, even in his youth, hardly what\r\nmen would expect from a mind so original and powerful, so sure and\r\nclear. And yet in all his relations to and great services for his\r\ncountry, in his incalculable contributions to the cause of eventual\r\nliberty, in his complex relations to science, art, literature, serious\r\nand valuable undertakings for the elevation of his fellows, in great\r\ntrials alike and among the midges of everyday existence, the world may\r\nsee in him the figure of a man: upright, alert, capable, resolute,\r\npatient, resourceful, and without guile.\r\n\r\nAs to few men it has been given to bring to the struggles of life so\r\ngreat a natural armament, few also have been able to wield in so short\r\na time a power so momentous. To all the Far East he is slowly becoming\r\na figure of inspiration and hope. To the modern Filipino world he gave\r\nan impetus and an impress it can hardly lose in generations if ever. To\r\nthe movement for Philippine independence he gave vitality, character,\r\nand energy that have grown stronger year after year. Even when we\r\nconsider the natural passion of the race for freedom and the long\r\nsuccession of revolts with which it shook Spanish rule, this remains\r\nsubstantially true. With his teachings first, then his sarcasms and\r\ncensures, then his appeals, he showed the way to unity and drove the\r\npeople along it. At his death he bequeathed to them his unquenchable\r\nyearning for liberty, while he gave them the necessary background of\r\nsacrifice for it. Whatever has been gained for nationality has been\r\ngained under this inspiration; without or beyond his knowledge, Rizal\r\nwas the father of Philippine independence and the lofty model toward\r\nwhich Philippine life may aspire.\r\n\r\nThose that seek to disparage the race (so called) to which he belonged\r\nfind some refuge in the assertion that he was a strange and\r\ninexplicable exception to the general incompetence, a star against a\r\nbackground of ineptitude. Against this all just men will protest.\r\nElsewhere the great minds of every nation have exalted that nation in\r\nthe world’s esteem. The single lives that make up so much of the\r\nhistoric glory surrounding Greece, Rome, Italy, Holland, and our own\r\nRevolutionary period we do not sharply contrast against a darkness of\r\ngeneral inferiority around these men, but think of them as lighting up\r\nall the land that bore them. Even if it were true that Rizal was the\r\nonly great man of the Filipino people, Filipinos might well claim the\r\nsame basis of judgment. But the more the leaders of the Philippine\r\nrevolution are studied—Mabini, Luna, the two del Pilars, Calderon—the\r\nmore men will be convinced that Rizal was the highest expression of an\r\nintellectual force, stimulated by the growing passion for liberty but\r\nstill a power inherent in the race.\r\n\r\nA race that gave such men to the world, that has at the same time\r\nproved so incontestably its capacity equally for self-expansion and for\r\nself-mastery, may well expect to be heard when asserting the foundation\r\nprinciples of faith and common honesty, it faces the United States and\r\nin the circle of nations demands the place it has earned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nTranslations of Poems by Rizal\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO THE PHILIPPINE YOUTH\r\n\r\n    Hold high the brow serene,\r\n    O youth, where now you stand;\r\n    Let the bright sheen\r\n    Of your grace be seen,\r\n    Fair hope of my fatherland!\r\n\r\n    Come now, thou genius grand,\r\n    And bring down inspiration;\r\n    With thy mighty hand,\r\n    Swifter than the wind’s violation,\r\n    Raise the eager mind to higher station.\r\n\r\n    Come down with pleasing light\r\n    Of art and science to the fight,\r\n    O youth, and there untie\r\n    The chains that heavy lie,\r\n    Your spirit free to blight.\r\n\r\n    See how in flaming zone\r\n    Amid the shadows thrown,\r\n    The Spaniard’s holy hand\r\n    A crown’s resplendent band\r\n    Proffers to this Indian land.\r\n\r\n    Thou, who now wouldst rise\r\n    On wings of rich emprise,\r\n    Seeking from Olympian skies\r\n    Songs of sweetest strain,\r\n    Softer than ambrosial rain;\r\n\r\n    Thou, whose voice divine\r\n    Rivals Philomel’s refrain,\r\n    And with varied line\r\n    Through the night benign\r\n    Frees mortality from pain;\r\n\r\n    Thou, who by sharp strife\r\n    Wakest thy mind to life;\r\n    And the memory bright\r\n    Of thy genius’ light\r\n    Makest immortal in its strength;\r\n\r\n    And thou, in accents clear\r\n    Of Phœbus, to Apelles dear;\r\n    Or by the brush’s magic art\r\n    Takest from nature’s store a part,\r\n    To fix it on the simple canvas’ length;\r\n\r\n    Go forth, and then the sacred fire\r\n    Of thy genius to the laurel may aspire;\r\n    To spread around the fame,\r\n    And in victory acclaim,\r\n    Through wider spheres the human name.\r\n\r\n    Day, O happy day,\r\n    Fair Filipinas, for thy land!\r\n    So bless the Power to-day\r\n    That places in thy way\r\n    This favor and this fortune grand!\r\n\r\n            —Translated by Charles Derbyshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    TO MY MUSE\r\n\r\n    Invoked no longer is the Muse,\r\n    The lyre is out of date;\r\n    The poets it no longer use,\r\n    And youth its inspiration now imbues\r\n    With other form and state.\r\n\r\n    If to-day our fancies aught\r\n    Of verse would still require,\r\n    Helicon’s hill remains unsought;\r\n    And without heed we but inquire,\r\n    Why the coffee is not brought.\r\n\r\n    In the place of thought sincere\r\n    That our hearts may feel,\r\n    We must seize a pen of steel,\r\n    And with verse and line severe\r\n    Fling abroad a jest and jeer.\r\n\r\n    Muse, that in the past inspired me,\r\n    And with songs of love hast fired me;\r\n    Go thou now to dull repose,\r\n    For to-day in sordid prose\r\n    I must earn the gold that hired me.\r\n\r\n    Now must I ponder deep,\r\n    Meditate, and struggle on;\r\n    E’en sometimes I must weep;\r\n    For he who love would keep\r\n    Great pain has undergone.\r\n\r\n    Fled are the days of ease,\r\n    The days of love’s delight;\r\n    When flowers still would please\r\n    And give to suffering souls surcease\r\n    From pain and sorrow’s blight.\r\n\r\n    One by one they have passed on,\r\n    All I loved and moved among;\r\n    Dead or married—from me gone,\r\n    For all I place my heart upon\r\n    By fate adverse are stung.\r\n\r\n    Go thou, too, O Muse, depart,\r\n    Other regions fairer find;\r\n    For my land but offers art\r\n    For the laurel, chains that bind,\r\n    For a temple, prisons blind.\r\n\r\n    But before thou leavest me, speak:\r\n    Tell me with thy voice sublime,\r\n    Thou couldst ever from me seek\r\n    A song of sorrow for the weak,\r\n    Defiance to the tyrant’s crime.\r\n\r\n            —Translated by Charles Derbyshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE SONG OF THE TRAVELER\r\n\r\n    Like to a leaf that is fallen and withered,\r\n      Tossed by the tempest from pole unto pole;\r\n    Thus roams the pilgrim abroad without purpose,\r\n      Roams without love, without country or soul.\r\n\r\n    Following anxiously treacherous fortune,\r\n      Fortune which e’en as he grasps at it flees;\r\n    Vain though the hopes that his yearning is seeking,\r\n      Yet does the pilgrim embark on the seas!\r\n\r\n    Ever impelled by the invisible power,\r\n      Destined to roam from the East to the West;\r\n    Oft he remembers the faces of loved ones,\r\n      Dreams of the day when he, too, was at rest.\r\n\r\n    Chance may assign him a tomb on the desert,\r\n      Grant him a final asylum of peace;\r\n    Soon by the world and his country forgotten,\r\n      God rest his soul when his wanderings cease!\r\n\r\n    Often the sorrowing pilgrim is envied,\r\n      Circling the globe like a sea-gull above;\r\n    Little, ah, little they know what a void\r\n      Saddens his soul by the absence of love.\r\n\r\n    Home may the pilgrim return in the future,\r\n      Back to his loved ones his footsteps he bends;\r\n    Naught will he find but the snow and the ruins,\r\n      Ashes of love and the tomb of his friends,\r\n\r\n    Pilgrim, begone! Nor return more hereafter,\r\n      Stranger thou art in the land of thy birth;\r\n    Others may sing of their love while rejoicing,\r\n      Thou once again must roam o’er the earth.\r\n\r\n    Pilgrim, begone! Nor return more hereafter,\r\n      Dry are the tears that a while for thee ran;\r\n    Pilgrim, begone! And forget thine affliction,\r\n      Loud laughs the world at the sorrows of man.\r\n\r\n                            —Translated by Arthur P.

E. R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    MY RETREAT\r\n\r\n    By the spreading beach where the sands are soft and fine,\r\n    At the foot of the mount in its mantle of green,\r\n    I have built my hut in the pleasant grove’s confine;\r\n    From the forest seeking peace and a calmness divine,\r\n    Rest for the weary brain and silence to my sorrow keen.\r\n\r\n    Its roof the frail palm-leaf and its floor the cane,\r\n    Its beams and posts of the unhewn wood;\r\n    Little there is of value in this hut so plain,\r\n    And better by far in the lap of the mount to have lain,\r\n    By the song and the murmur of the high sea’s flood.\r\n\r\n    A purling brook from the woodland glade\r\n    Drops down o’er the stones and around it sweeps,\r\n    Whence a fresh stream is drawn by the rough cane’s aid;\r\n    That in the still night its murmur has made,\r\n    And in the day’s heat a crystal fountain leaps.\r\n\r\n    When the sky is serene how gently it flows,\r\n    And its zither unseen ceaselessly plays;\r\n    But when the rains fall a torrent it goes\r\n    Boiling and foaming through the rocky close.\r\n    Roaring unchecked to the sea’s wide ways.\r\n\r\n    The howl of the dog and the song of the bird,\r\n    And only the kalaw’s hoarse call resound;\r\n    Nor is the voice of vain man to be heard,\r\n    My mind to harness or my steps to begird;\r\n    The woodlands alone and the sea wrap me round.\r\n\r\n    The sea, ah, the sea! for me it is all,\r\n    As it massively sweeps from the worlds apart;\r\n    Its smile in the morn to my soul is a call,\r\n    And when in the even my faith seems to pall,\r\n    It breathes with its sadness an echo to my heart.\r\n\r\n    By night an arcanum; when translucent it glows,\r\n    All spangled over with its millions of lights,\r\n    And the bright sky above resplendent shows;\r\n    While the waves with their sighs tell of their woes—\r\n    Tales that are lost as they roll to the heights.\r\n\r\n    They tell of the world when the first dawn broke,\r\n    And the sunlight over their surface played;\r\n    When thousands of beings from nothingness woke,\r\n    To people the depths and the heights to cloak,\r\n    Wherever its life-giving kiss was laid.\r\n\r\n    But when in the night the wild waves awake,\r\n    And the waves in their fury begin to leap,\r\n    Through the air rush the cries that my mind shake;\r\n    Voices that pray, songs and moans that partake\r\n    Of laments from the souls sunk down in the deep.\r\n\r\n    Then from their heights the mountains groan,\r\n    And the trees shiver tremulous from great unto least;\r\n    The groves rustle plaintive and the herds utter moan,\r\n    For they say that the ghosts of the folk that are gone\r\n    Are calling them down to their death’s merry feast.\r\n\r\n    In terror and confusion whispers the night,\r\n    While blue and green flames flit over the deep;\r\n    But calm reigns again with the morning’s light,\r\n    And soon the bold fisherman comes into sight,\r\n    As his bark rushes on and the waves sink to sleep.\r\n\r\n    So onward glide the days in my lonely abode;\r\n    Driven forth from the world where once I was known,\r\n    I muse o’er the fate upon me bestowed;\r\n    A fragment forgotten that the moss will corrode,\r\n    To hide from mankind the world in me shown.\r\n\r\n    I live in the thought of the lov’d ones left,\r\n    And oft their names to my mind are borne;\r\n    Some have forsaken me and some by death are reft;\r\n    But now ’tis all one, as through the past I drift,\r\n    That past that from me can never be torn.\r\n\r\n    For it is the friend that is with me always,\r\n    That ever in sorrow keeps the faith in my soul;\r\n    While through the still night it watches and prays,\r\n    As here in my exile in my lone hut it stays,\r\n    To strengthen my faith when doubts o’er me roll.\r\n\r\n    That faith I keep and I hope to see shine\r\n    The day when the Idea prevails over might;\r\n    When after the fray and death’s slow decline,\r\n    Some other voice sounds, far happier than mine,\r\n    To raise the glad song of the triumph of right.\r\n\r\n    I see the sky glow, refulgent and clear,\r\n    As when it forced on me my first dear illusion;\r\n    I feel the same wind kiss my forehead sere,\r\n    And the fire is the same that is burning here\r\n    To stir up youth’s blood in boiling confusion.\r\n\r\n    I breathe here the winds that perchance have pass’d\r\n    O’er the fields and the rivers of my own natal shore;\r\n    And mayhap they will bring on the returning blast\r\n    The sighs that lov’d being upon them has cast—\r\n    Messages sweet from the first love I bore.\r\n\r\n    To see the same moon, all silver’d as of yore,\r\n    I feel the sad thoughts within me arise;\r\n    The fond recollections of the troth we swore,\r\n    Of the field and the bower and the wide sea-shore,\r\n    The blushes of joy, with the silence and sighs.\r\n\r\n    A butterfly seeking the flowers and the light,\r\n    Of other lands dreaming, of vaster extent;\r\n    Scarce a youth, from home and love I took flight,\r\n    To wander unheeding, free from doubt or affright—\r\n    So in foreign lands were my brightest days spent.\r\n\r\n    I, when like a languishing bird I was fain\r\n    To the home of my fathers and my love to return,\r\n    Of a sudden the fierce tempest roar’d amain;\r\n    So I saw my wings shatter’d and no home remain,\r\n    My trust sold to others and wrecks round me burn.\r\n\r\n    Hurl’d out into exile from the land I adore,\r\n    My future all dark and no refuge to seek;\r\n    My roseate dreams hover round me once more,\r\n    Sole treasures of all that life to me bore;\r\n    The faiths of youth that with sincerity speak.\r\n\r\n    But not as of old, full of life and of grace,\r\n    Do you hold out hopes of undying reward;\r\n    Sadder I find you; on your lov’d face,\r\n    Though still sincere, the pale lines trace\r\n    The marks of the faith it is yours to guard.\r\n\r\n    You offer now, dreams, my gloom to appease,\r\n    And the years of my youth again to disclose;\r\n    So I thank you, O storm, and heaven-born breeze,\r\n    That you knew of the hour my wild flight to ease,\r\n    To cast me back down to the soil whence I rose.\r\n\r\n    By the spreading beach where the sands are soft and fine,\r\n    At the foot of the mount in the pleasant grove’s confine,\r\n    I have found a home in its mantle of green,\r\n    In the shady woods, that peace and calmness divine,\r\n    Rest for the weary brain and silence to my sorrow keen.\r\n\r\n                                —Translated by Charles

dream is known;\r\n    The land that I can call my own,\r\n    By me forgotten ne’er to be,\r\n    Where trilling birds their song taught me,\r\n    And cascades with their ceaseless roar,\r\n    And all along the spreading shore\r\n    The murmurs of the sounding sea.\r\n\r\n    While yet in childhood’s happy day,\r\n    I learned upon its sun to smile,\r\n    And in my breast there seems the while\r\n    Seething volcanic fires to play.\r\n    A bard I was, my wish alway\r\n    To call upon the fleeting wind,\r\n    With all the force of verse and mind:\r\n    “Go forth, and spread around its flame,\r\n    From zone to zone with glad acclaim,\r\n    And earth to heaven together bind!”\r\n\r\n    But it I left, and now no more—\r\n    Like a tree that is broken and sere—\r\n    My natal gods bring the echo clear\r\n    Of songs that in past times they bore;\r\n    Wide seas I cross’d to foreign shore,\r\n    With hope of change and other fate;\r\n    My folly was made clear too late,\r\n    For in the place of good I sought\r\n    The seas reveal’d unto me naught,\r\n    But made death’s specter on me wait.\r\n\r\n    All these fond fancies that were mine,\r\n    All love, all feeling, all emprise,\r\n    Were left beneath the sunny skies,\r\n    Which o’er that flowery region shine;\r\n    So press no more that plea of thine,\r\n    For songs of love from out a heart\r\n    That coldly lies a thing apart;\r\n    Since now with tortur’d soul I haste\r\n    Unresting o’er the desert waste,\r\n    And lifeless gone is all the art.\r\n\r\n

R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nRIZAL AS A PATRIOT, AUTHOR, AND SCIENTIST\r\n\r\nBy Francis Burton Harrison, Governor-General 1915–21\r\n\r\n[Of all the governor-generals the Philippines have had, Mr. Harrison\r\nwas the most beloved by the islanders. He seemed to have an instinctive\r\nsympathy with them and after his retirement from office testified to\r\ntheir worth in a remarkable book, “The Cornerstone of Philippine\r\nIndependence.” The comments that follow are extracts from an address he\r\ndelivered at the laying of the corner-stone of Rizal Hall, Philippine\r\nUniversity, December 15, 1919.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAddressing a university audience, I have selected three points in the\r\nlife and writing of Dr. Rizal for your consideration. First is his\r\npatriotism. This university must devote its best efforts to teaching\r\nthe students of to-day and those of coming generations that form of\r\npure and unselfish patriotism that we find in the writings and sayings\r\nof Dr. Rizal. We have been gratified to follow the course in debate and\r\nin action of the students of this university in devoting their\r\nattention in a purely non-partizan way to the consideration of public\r\nquestions of the day, but I address myself to the faculty as well as to\r\nthe students for consideration of the form which that patriotism should\r\ntake. In the days of my grandfather young men in America went to\r\nGermany to study at the universities. That was the golden age when the\r\nteachings and memory of Goethe, Schiller, Lessing, and Heine inspired\r\nthe youth of the land and brought about a political movement that was\r\ncrushed and ended in 1848 in the death of liberalism and the beginning\r\nof modern autocracy. Those of us that were educated in German\r\nliterature can scarcely understand the Germany of the last three\r\ndecades, and yet, in my opinion, their devotion to the religion of\r\nbrutality and force is to be found in the teachings of their modern\r\nuniversity professors—an example that has terrified all mankind and\r\nthreatened the liberties of the world. So I say the teaching of pure\r\npatriotism must always be dedicated to the promotion of liberties, the\r\nliberty of thought, of the individual, to the care of the welfare of\r\nthe common people, and for the progress and advancement in modern\r\nscience of learning of the people of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nThe literary aspect of Rizal’s works should commend itself to each of\r\nyou as an inspiration to do your own duty. I think no man can read\r\nRizal’s novels without feeling his powerful impulse of sympathy for and\r\nunderstanding of the people of this country. We can be moved not only\r\nby his profound reading of human nature, but we can also be inspired to\r\nemulate, if we may, the high level of talent for which his name will\r\never be famous in the history of literature. Here in the Philippines I\r\nwould, if I could, arouse you to more earnest devotion to a literary\r\ncareer. You have natural advantages second to no country in the world.\r\nYour history is replete with incidents and romance and your present\r\nlatter-day development is a true inspiration to the youth of the world\r\nin all countries. Last winter when I returned to New York for my first\r\nvacation home I remember one particularly dark and gloomy day when the\r\npeople on the streets, which are nothing more than cañons between high\r\nbuildings of stone and glass, were jostling one another without a spark\r\nof human sympathy or appreciation, conscious competitors in the\r\nstruggle for the survival of the fittest; and my mind went back to\r\nthose scenes of every-day life in the Philippines, to this land of\r\nlofty mountains, of clear water running to the sea, the sunsets across\r\nMariveles Mountain, the dawn over Mount Arayat, the blue haze upon the\r\nrice-fields in the evening—all the familiar scenes and sounds of a life\r\nanimate by the sun and made happy by the richness of nature. As I\r\nremembered the deep and tender lights of the coconut groves and the\r\nbusy industry of your daily life, I said to myself, “There is a country\r\nwhich could inspire any man to literary efforts with all its wealth of\r\nromance.” When I recall the history of the Philippine Islands, the\r\ncoming of the Christians with the sword and flaming cross, the coming\r\nof the Mohammedans, with the crescent and the crooked creese and their\r\ncry in many a hard-fought battle, the enterprise of the Spaniard in\r\nspiritual teachings as well as in material investments, the shouts of\r\nLegaspi’s sailors across Manila Bay, the guns of Dewey so many\r\ngenerations later, the efforts of our country to establish here our\r\nprinciples of democracy, it seems to me that any young man or woman\r\nborn upon this soil and inspired by these ideas has an opportunity to\r\ntake a place in the very foremost ranks of literature and history and\r\nshow to the world not only what has been done here in education but\r\nwhat the world may expect of the Filipino people when they take their\r\nrank as an independent member of the brotherhood of nations.\r\n\r\nIn the scientific aspect of his teachings Rizal ranked high in public\r\nappreciation, higher indeed in other countries than at that time he was\r\nallowed to rank here. He was recognized for his scientific work in\r\nethnology, in zoölogy, and in botany in England and in the leading\r\nuniversities of Germany. Upon his death, the most distinguished\r\nscientist in Germany of that day, Professor Virchow, stated that this\r\nwas a murder of the most prominent scientist that Spain possessed. In\r\nmy opinion Rizal’s greatest services to the cause of the human race\r\nwere those scientific impulses which he gave to the world of his duty,\r\nand the martyrdom which he suffered was but another example of the\r\ndetermination of organized society in every age to eliminate those that\r\nby the pure processes of reason have arrived at new theories for the\r\nconduct and welfare of mankind. From the day of Socrates, who was put\r\nto death by the citizens of Athens for teaching the young men to think\r\nfor themselves, down to that morning in December, 1896, when Rizal was\r\ndone to death by the firing-squad at Bagumbayan, the pages of history\r\nhave run red with the murder of men of science. In Europe of the Middle\r\nAges the names of Roger Bacon, Giordano Bruno, Galileo, Agrippa,\r\nCampanella, Kepler, Lavoisier, of Priestly, and many others of less\r\ndistinction in the annals of history have shown what struggles the\r\nhuman mind has been called upon to endure and to what stress the human\r\nbody has been put in the efforts of science to liberate the human\r\nmind....\r\n\r\nBearing all these things in mind, it seems to me that we can justly\r\nappreciate Rizal’s love of science and his final martyrdom as the\r\ngreatest contribution to the freedom of thought ever given by any one\r\nman to the Filipino people. This hall which we are about to dedicate,\r\nreserved as it is to be for the study of science, is the most fitting\r\nmonument to the name of Rizal that could be devised. Were he alive\r\nto-day I have no doubt he would feel an infinitely greater inspiration\r\nin the thought that his name was to be attached to this great edifice\r\nand that his memory was to be preserved by the study of young\r\nFilipinos, men and women, in the natural sciences than he would be in\r\nthat splendid statue erected down there on the Bagumbayan to perpetuate\r\nthe memory of his patriotic death.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, in dedicating this edifice to progress, I believe that\r\nit will stand for progress as long as the Filipino people themselves\r\nremain progressive and as long as you will fight the battle for liberty\r\nof thought and of reason, and, I believe, also, that Dr. Rizal, if he\r\nhas any conscious knowledge in those ethereal spaces to which his soul\r\nhas been summoned, will summon the youth of his beloved country to dare\r\nall, to endure all, and, if needs be, to suffer all that he himself had\r\ndared, endured, or suffered in order that science may not perish from\r\nthe face of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATIVE COOPER’S TRIBUTE\r\n\r\nDelivered in the House of Representatives, Washington, June 19, 1902\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that if American institutions had done nothing else\r\nthan furnish to the world the character of George Washington, that\r\nalone would entitle them to the respect of mankind. So, sir, I say to\r\nall those that denounce the Filipinos indiscriminately as barbarians\r\nand savages, without possibility of a civilized future, that this\r\ndespised race proved itself entitled to their respect and to the\r\nrespect of mankind when it furnished to the world the character of José\r\nRizal.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Cooper then recited to the House Rizal’s “Last Farewell” as\r\ndescribed on a foregoing page. The profound silence that fell upon the\r\nchamber at the end of this recital he broke by saying:]\r\n\r\nPirates! Barbarians! Savages! Incapable of civilization! How many of\r\nthe civilized Caucasian slanderers of his race could ever be capable of\r\nthoughts like these, which on that awful night, as he sat alone amidst\r\nsilence unbroken save by the rustling of the black plumes of the death\r\nangel at his side, poured from the soul of the martyred Filipino?\r\nSearch the long and bloody roll of the world’s heroic dead, and where,\r\non what soil, under what sky, did Tyranny ever claim a nobler victim?\r\nSir, the future is not without hope for a people that, from the midst\r\nof such an environment, has furnished to the world a character so lofty\r\nand so pure as that of José Rizal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D\r\n\r\nRIZAL’S VIEWS ON THE RACE PROBLEM\r\n\r\nFrom an Article on Rizal in the “International Archiv für\r\nEthnographie,” by Ferdinand Blumentritt, in part translated and\r\nabridged by R. L. Packard in the “Popular Science Monthly,” July, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\nRizal devoted himself particularly to the analysis of the sentiments\r\nwith which the white and the colored races mutually regard each other.\r\nNo one was so well qualified as he to study this question, which is of\r\nsuch importance to folk-psychology, for he was of himself of a colored\r\nrace, had lived among his fellow-countrymen at his own home as well as\r\namong the whites, those of mixed bloods, and other classes at Manila,\r\nand had besides come to know Hong-Kong, Japan, Europe, and the United\r\nStates and that in a thorough way and not as a mere tourist. His\r\nextensive acquaintance with languages opened for him the ethnological\r\nwritings of all civilized nations, and his penetrating intellect\r\nprevented him from remaining content with the surface of things. It\r\nshould be said, however, that Rizal concerned himself wholly with the\r\nrelations between the white and the colored peoples of the Pacific\r\nbecause, as he explained, he knew nothing of the psychology of other\r\ncolored races.\r\n\r\nHe said that as a boy he was deeply sensible that the Spaniards treated\r\nhim with contemptuous disregard for the sole reason that he was a\r\nFilipino. From the moment when he discovered this attitude of theirs he\r\nendeavored to find out what right the Spaniards and the other whites\r\ngenerally had to look down upon people who think as they think, study\r\nthe same things they study, and have the same mental capacity they\r\npossess, simply because these people have a brown skin and stiff,\r\nstraight hair.\r\n\r\nEuropeans regard themselves as the sovereign masters of the earth, the\r\nonly supporters of progress and culture and the sole legitimate species\r\nof the genus Homo sapiens, while they proclaim that all other races are\r\ninferior by refusing to acknowledge their capability of acquiring\r\nEuropean culture, so that, according to the European view, the colored\r\nraces are varieties of the genus Homo brutus. Rizal then asked himself,\r\nAre these views just? He began asking this question when he was a\r\nschool-boy and at the same time began to answer it by observing his\r\nwhite fellow-students closely while he studied his own mental processes\r\nand emotions in order to make comparisons.\r\n\r\nHe soon remarked that in school, at least, no difference could be\r\ndetected between the intellectual level of the whites and Filipinos.\r\nThere were lazy and industrious, moral and immoral, dull and\r\nintelligent boys among the whites as well as among the Filipino\r\nscholars. Soon this study of race spurred him to exert himself to the\r\nutmost in his school studies, and a kind of race rivalry took\r\npossession of him. He was overjoyed whenever he succeeded in solving a\r\ndifficult problem that baffled his white companions. But he did not\r\nregard these events as personal successes so much as triumphs of his\r\nown collective people. Thus it was in school that he first became\r\nconvinced that whites go through the same intellectual operations as\r\nFilipinos and—ceteris paribus—progress in the same way and to the same\r\nextent. From this observation he came to the conclusion that whites and\r\nFilipinos have the same intellectual endowment.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this conclusion there manifested itself in Rizal, as\r\nhe himself avowed, a sort of national self-exaltation. He began to\r\nbelieve that the Tagalogs must stand higher intellectually than the\r\nSpaniards (the only whites he had known up to that time) and he used to\r\nlike to tell how he came to this fallacious conclusion. In the first\r\nplace, he said, in his school the whites received instruction in their\r\nown language while the Filipinos had to worry with strange idioms in\r\norder to receive instruction which was given in it alone. The\r\nFilipinos, therefore, must be better endowed intellectually than the\r\nSpaniards, he inferred, since they not only kept up with the Spaniards\r\nin their studies but even surpassed them, although handicapped by a\r\ndifferent language. Still another observation caused him to disbelieve\r\nin the superiority of the European intelligence. He noticed that the\r\nSpaniards believed that the Filipinos looked up to them as beings of a\r\nsuperior nation and made of a finer clay than themselves. But Rizal\r\nknew very well that the respectfulness the Filipinos manifested toward\r\nthe Spaniards did not proceed from self-depreciation but was simply\r\ndictated by fear and self-interest.\r\n\r\nBy fear because they saw in the Spaniard their lord and master who\r\noppressed them arbitrarily even with good intentions; by self-interest\r\nbecause they had observed that his pride of race lays the European open\r\nto flattery and that they could get large concessions from him by a\r\nlittle subserviency. The Filipinos do not therefore have any real\r\nrespect for the European but cringe and bow to him from interested\r\nmotives alone. Behind his back they laugh at him, ridicule his\r\npresumption, and regard themselves as in reality the shrewder of the\r\ntwo races. Because the Spaniards never divined the real sentiment of\r\nthe Filipinos toward themselves, young Rizal felt justified in\r\nregarding them as inferior in intelligence to his own countrymen. But\r\nin later years he found it necessary to change this false impression of\r\nhis youth, especially as he had found by his own personal experience\r\nhow easy it is to draw mistaken conclusions about people of a different\r\nrace from one’s own. “Whenever,” he used to say, “I came upon\r\ncondemnation of my people by Europeans either in conversation or in\r\nbooks I recalled these foolish ideas of my youth, my indignation\r\ncooled, and I could smile and quote the French proverb, ‘Tout\r\ncomprendre, c’est tout pardonner.’”\r\n\r\nDr. Rizal’s sojourn in Spain opened to him a new world. His\r\nintellectual horizon began to widen with his new experiences. New ideas\r\nthronged in upon him. He came from a land which was the very home of\r\nbigotry, where the Spanish friar, the Spanish official, and the Spanish\r\nsoldier governed with absolute sway. But in Madrid he found the exact\r\nopposite of this repression. Free-thinkers and atheists spoke freely in\r\ndisparaging terms of religion and the church; the authority of the\r\nGovernment he found to be at a minimum, while he not only saw Liberals\r\ncontending with the Clerical Party but he beheld with astonishment\r\nRepublicans and Carlists openly promoting the development of their\r\npolitical ideas.\r\n\r\nStill greater was the influence upon him of his residence in France,\r\nGermany, and England. In those countries he enlarged his scientific\r\ninformation, or it would be better, perhaps, to say that there the\r\nspirit of modern philology was revealed to him and there he learned the\r\nmeaning of the word “ethnology.”\r\n\r\nThe personal influence of the late Dr. Rost of London was most marked\r\nin the philological training of Dr. Rizal. His teachings and the study\r\nof the works of W. von Humboldt, Jacquet, and Professor H. Kern opened\r\na new world for the Filipino scholar. He formed a plan to write a work\r\nupon the Tagalog verb, which he afterward modified, and while an exile\r\nin Dapitan in Mindanao he began to write a Tagalog grammar in English\r\nand at the same time prepared an essay upon the allied elements in the\r\nTagalog and Visayan languages. The former work he intended to dedicate\r\nto Professor Kern, in the name of the Malay race; the latter he wished\r\nto inscribe to the memory of Dr. Rost. It was not granted to him to\r\ncomplete the manuscript of either, for he was interrupted in the midst\r\nof his work to be dragged about from tribunal to tribunal until his\r\nfinal sentence and death by public execution.\r\n\r\nFortunately, his work upon the transcription of Tagalog remains to us,\r\na translation having appeared in the “Bijdragen” of the Indian\r\nInstitute. Unfortunately, this work only increased the hatred of his\r\npolitical opponents, for the Spaniards were very much opposed to any\r\nindependent work on the part of the Filipinos, being convinced that\r\neverything of the kind was merely a cloak for separatist views, and\r\nwhatever was suspected of separatism in the Philippines was certain of\r\nmeeting an unhappy fate.\r\n\r\nRizal, brought up among the Spaniards, was no better instructed than\r\nthey themselves in modern ethnology, and, indeed, it was through\r\nProfessor Blumentritt’s instrumentality that his attention was first\r\ndirected to the defects in his education in that direction, whereupon\r\nhe began with ardor to enlarge his knowledge in comparative ethnology.\r\nThe works upon general ethnography by Perschel, F. Müller, Waitz,\r\nGerland, and Ratzel, the ethnographical parallels of André, Wilkins’s\r\nwork, the culture-historical publications of Lippert and Helwald became\r\nat once the subject of his industrious and thorough study, a study,\r\nfurthermore, that not only enlarged his knowledge but afforded him the\r\nconsolation of the assurance that his people were not an anthropoid\r\nrace as the Spanish asserted, for he found that the faults and virtues\r\nof the Tagal are entirely human, and, moreover, he became convinced\r\nthat the virtues and vices of any people are not mere peculiarities of\r\na race but inherited qualities, qualities that become affected by\r\nclimate and history.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he continued what he called his “course in practical\r\nethnology”; that is to say, he studied the life of the French and\r\nGerman peasants, because he thought that a peasantry preserves national\r\nand race peculiarities longer than the other classes of a people, and\r\nalso because he believed he ought to compare only the peasantry of\r\nEurope with his own countrymen, because the latter were nearly all\r\npeasants. With this object in view he withdrew for weeks to some quiet\r\nvillage where he observed closely the daily life of the country people.\r\n\r\nHe summed up the results of his scientific and “practical” studies in\r\nthe following propositions:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. The races of man differ in outward appearance and in the\r\n    structure of the skeleton but not in their physical qualities. The\r\n    same passions and pains affect the white, yellow, brown, and black\r\n    races; the same motives influence their actions, only the form in\r\n    which the emotions are expressed and the way the actions are\r\n    directed are different. Neither is this particular form of conduct\r\n    and expression constant with any race or people but varies under\r\n    the influence of the most diverse factors.\r\n\r\n    2. Races exist only for the anthropologists. For a student of the\r\n    customs of a people there are only social strata, and it is the\r\n    task of the ethnologist to separate and identify these strata. And\r\n    just as we mark out the lines of stratification in the mountain\r\n    ranges of a geological sketch so ought we to mark out the social\r\n    strata of the human race. And just as there are mountains whose\r\n    summits do not reach to the highest strata of the geological\r\n    system, so there are many people that do not reach the highest\r\n    social strata, while the lowest strata are common to all of them.\r\n    Even in the old established civilizations of France and Germany a\r\n    great proportion of the population forms a class which is upon the\r\n    same intellectual level with the majority of the Tagal, and is to\r\n    be distinguished from them only by the color of the skin, clothing,\r\n    and language. But while mountains do not grow higher, peoples do\r\n    gradually grow up into the higher strata of civilization, and this\r\n    growth does not depend upon the intellectual capacity alone of a\r\n    given people, but it is also due to some extent to good fortune and\r\n    to other factors, some of which can be explained and others not.\r\n\r\n    3. Since not only the statesmen who conduct colonial affairs but\r\n    scientific men as well maintain that there are races of limited\r\n    intelligence that could never attain the height of European\r\n    culture, the real explanation must be as follows: The higher\r\n    intelligence may be compared to wealth—there are rich and poor\r\n    peoples just as there are rich and poor individuals. The rich man\r\n    that believes he was born rich deceives himself. He came into the\r\n    world as poor and naked as his slave, but he inherits the wealth\r\n    that his parents earned. In the same way intelligence is inherited.\r\n    Races that formerly found themselves compelled by certain special\r\n    conditions to exercise their mental powers to an unusual extent\r\n    have naturally developed their intelligence to a higher degree than\r\n    others and they have bequeathed this intelligence to their\r\n    descendants, who in turn have increased it by further use.\r\n    Europeans are rich in intelligence but the present inhabitants of\r\n    Europe could not affirm without presumption that their ancestors\r\n    were just as rich in intelligence at the start as they themselves\r\n    are now. The Europeans have required centuries of strife and\r\n    effort, of fortunate conjunctions, of the necessary ability, of\r\n    advantageous laws, and of individual leading men to enable them to\r\n    bequeath their intellectual wealth to their present\r\n    representatives. The people that are so intelligent to-day have\r\n    become so through a long process of transmission and struggles.\r\n    History shows that the Romans thought no better of the Germans than\r\n    the Spaniards think of the Tagalog, and when Tacitus praises the\r\n    Germans he does so in the same style of philosophical idealizing\r\n    that we see in the followers of Rousseau, who thought that their\r\n    political ideal was realized in Tahaiti.\r\n\r\n    4. The condemnatory criticism of the Filipinos by the Spaniards is\r\n    easy to explain but appears not to be justified. Rizal demonstrated\r\n    this in the following way: Weaklings do not emigrate to foreign\r\n    lands but only men of energy that travel hence already prejudiced\r\n    against the colored races and reach their destination with the\r\n    conviction, which is usually sanctioned by law, that they are\r\n    called to rule the latter. If we remember, what few white men know,\r\n    that the Filipinos fear the brutality of the whites, it is easy to\r\n    explain why they make such a poor showing in works written by the\r\n    white while they themselves cannot reply in print. If we consider\r\n    further that the Filipinos with whom the whites had dealings\r\n    belong, for the most part, to the lower strata of society, the\r\n    opinions of them given by the whites have about the same value as\r\n    that of an educated Tagal would have who should travel to Europe\r\n    and judge all Germans and French by the dairy-maids, porters,\r\n    waiters, and cab-drivers he might meet.\r\n\r\n    5. The misfortune of the Filipinos is in the color of their skin\r\n    and in that alone. In Europe there are a great many persons that\r\n    have risen from the lowest dregs of the populace to the highest\r\n    offices and honors. Such people may be divided into two classes,\r\n    those that accommodate themselves to their new position without\r\n    pretensions and whose origin is consequently not imputed to them as\r\n    a disgrace, but on the contrary they are respected as self-made\r\n    men; and the conventional parvenus, who are ridiculed and detested\r\n    universally.\r\n\r\n    A Filipino would find himself ordinarily in the second of these two\r\n    classes no matter how noble his character or how perfect a\r\n    gentleman he might be in his manners and conduct, because his\r\n    origin is indelibly stamped upon his countenance, visible to all, a\r\n    mark that always carries with it painful humiliations for the\r\n    unfortunate native since it for ever exposes him to the prejudices\r\n    of the whites. Everything he does is minutely examined; a trifling\r\n    error in the toilet, which would be overlooked in a shoemaker’s son\r\n    that had acquired the title of baron, and might easily happen to a\r\n    pure-blooded descendant of the Montmorencys, in his case excites\r\n    amusement and you hear the remark: “What else do you expect? He is\r\n    only a native.” But even if he does not infringe any of the rules\r\n    of etiquette, and is besides an able lawyer or a skilful physician,\r\n    his accomplishments are not taken as a matter of course, but he is\r\n    regarded with a kind of good-natured surprise, a feeling much like\r\n    the astonishment with which one regards a well trained dog in a\r\n    circus, but never as a man of the same capabilities as a white man.\r\n\r\n    Another reason for the mean opinion in which the Filipinos have\r\n    been held by the whites is found in the circumstance that in the\r\n    tropics all the servants are colored. They have the defects of\r\n    their social class and of servants everywhere. Now, when a German\r\n    housewife complains of her servants, she does not extend their bad\r\n    qualities to the whole German nation; but this is done unblushingly\r\n    by Europeans that live in the tropics, and they never apparently\r\n    feel any compunctions but sleep the sleep of the just, undisturbed\r\n    by conscience.\r\n\r\n    The merchants also have contributed to the unfavorable judgment of\r\n    the Filipinos. Europeans come to the tropics in order to get rich\r\n    as soon as possible, which can only be done by buying from the\r\n    natives at astoundingly low rates. The latter, however, do not\r\n    regard this proceeding as a really commercial one, but they believe\r\n    that the whites are trying to cheat them; and they govern\r\n    themselves accordingly by trying, on their side, to overreach the\r\n    whites while their dealings with one another are far more\r\n    honorable. Consequently the Europeans call the natives liars and\r\n    cheats, while it never occurs to them that their own exploiting of\r\n    the ignorance of the natives is a conscienceless proceeding, or\r\n    rather they believe that, as whites, they are morally justified in\r\n    dealing immorally with the natives because the latter are colored.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Rizal finally came to think that he need no longer wonder at the\r\nprejudice of the whites against his people after he saw in Europe what\r\nunjustifiable prejudices European nations entertain against one\r\nanother. He himself was always benevolent and moderate in his judgment\r\nof foreign peoples. His active and keen mind, his personal amiability,\r\nhis politeness and manner as a man of the world, and his good and noble\r\nheart gained him friends everywhere, and, therefore, the tragic death\r\nof this intellectually distinguished and amiable man aroused general\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nRizal was an artist of delicate perceptions, a draftsman and sculptor\r\nas well as a scholar and ethnologist. Professor Blumentritt possesses\r\nthree statues made by him of terra cotta which might aptly serve as\r\nsymbols of his life. One represents Prometheus bound. The second\r\nrepresents the victory of death over life, and this scene is imagined\r\nwith peculiar originality: a skeleton in a monk’s cowl bears in its\r\narms the inanimate body of a young maiden. The third shows us a female\r\nform standing upon a death’s head and holding a torch in her high\r\nuplifted hands. This is the triumph of knowledge of the soul over\r\ndeath. Rizal, concludes Professor Blumentritt, was undoubtedly the most\r\ndistinguished man not only of his own people but of the Malay race in\r\ngeneral. His memory will never die in his fatherland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E\r\n\r\nSPECIMEN PAGES FROM RIZAL’S DIARY\r\n\r\n\r\n(It was more a series of notes to assist his memory than a daily record\r\nof events. Some of the entries are illegible.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday, April 28 (1888). We arrived at San Francisco in the morning.\r\nWe anchored. It is said that we shall be quarantined. The Custom House\r\nboat visited us: its flag has this look: [American Customs flag drawn].\r\nThe sacks or bags of silk were taken away; a sack costing $700. They\r\nare not afraid of the silk; and they were to take their breakfast on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nSunday, April 29. Second day of the quarantine. We are greatly troubled\r\nand impatient aboard. I have not eaten; it gets my nerve.\r\n\r\nMonday, 30. The quarantine is continued. I read in the paper a\r\nstatement of the Sanitary Doctor against quarantine.\r\n\r\nTuesday, May 1. The quarantine is continued. We signed a petition\r\nagainst the quarantine; and the Englishmen wrote to their Consul.\r\n\r\nThursday, May 3. Six days of quarantine.\r\n\r\nFriday, May 4, at 3 P.M. the quarantine is ended. I stayed at Palace\r\nHotel: $4 a day with bath and everything. Stockton-Str. 312. I saw the\r\nGolden Gate.... The Custom House. A letter of recommendation. On Sunday\r\nstores were closed. The best St. in San Francisco is Market St. I took\r\na walk.—Stanford, the rich man.—A street near the China Town. We left\r\nSan Francisco on Sunday, the 6th, at 4.30 P.M.—Sailed till\r\nOakland—Railroad—On board from Port Costa to Benicia—Plantations—Herds\r\nof cattle—No herdsmen—Stores at the camp—Dinner at Sacramento, 75\r\ncents. We slept in the coach. Regular night. We woke up an hour from\r\nReno, where we took our breakfast at 7.30 of Monday, May 7.... I saw an\r\nIndian [Indio] attired in semi-European suit, and semi-Indian suit,\r\nleaning against a wall. Wide deserts without plants nor trees.\r\nUnpopulated. Lonely place. Bare mountains. Sands. A big extension of\r\nwhite land, like chalk. Far from this desert can be seen some blue\r\nmountains. It was a fine day. It was warm, and there was still snow on\r\nthe top of some mountains.\r\n\r\nTuesday, May 8: This is a beautiful morning. We stop from place to\r\nplace. We are near Ogden. I believe with a good system of irrigation\r\nthis place could be cultivated. We are at Utah state, the 3rd. state we\r\ncrossed over. In approaching Ogden the fields are seen with horses,\r\noxen, and trees. Some small houses are seen from a distance. From Ogden\r\nto Denver. The clock is set one hour ahead of time. We are now\r\nbeginning to see flowers with yellow color on the way. The mountains at\r\na distance are covered with snow. The banks of Salt Lake are more\r\nbeautiful than other things we saw. The mules are very big. There are\r\nmountains in the middle of the lake like the islands of Talim in Laguna\r\nde Bay. We saw three Mormon boys at Farmington. There were sheep, cows\r\nand horses in the meadows. This region not thickly populated. A flock\r\nof ducks in the lake. There were beautiful houses with trees, straight\r\nstreets, flowers, low houses. Children greeted us at Salt Lake City. In\r\nUtah the women serve at the table. It is known that dinner will be\r\ncheap (?). We changed train at Ogden, and we will not have any change\r\nuntil Denver. In Provo I ate much for 75 cents. We are passing between\r\ntwo mountains through a narrow channel.\r\n\r\nWed. May 9. We are passing through the mountains of rocks along a\r\nriver; the river is noisy and its noise gives life to the lifeless\r\nscenery. We woke up at Colorado the 4th state we crossed over. At 10/30\r\nwe climb up a certain height, and this is why snow is seen along the\r\nway. There were many pines. The snow on the mountain top is white and\r\nshiny. We passed through tunnels made of wood, to protect the road\r\nagainst snow. Icicles in these tunnels are very bright which gives\r\nmajestic effect.—The Porter of the Pullman Car, an American, is a sort\r\nof thief.—Colorado has more trees than the three states we passed over.\r\nThere are many horses.\r\n\r\nThursday, May 10. We woke up at Nebraska. The country is a plain. We\r\nreached Omaha, a big city at 4 P.M., the biggest since we left San\r\nFrancisco. The Missouri river is twice as wide as the Pasig river in\r\nits wide part. It is marshy. Islands are formed in the middle of the\r\nriver; its banks are not beautiful. This region has many horses and\r\ncattle. The train passed over the Missouri bridge for 2 and 1/2\r\nminutes; the train goes slowly. We are now in Illinois.\r\n\r\nFriday, May 11. We wake up near Chicago. The country is cultivated. It\r\nshows our nearness to Chicago. We left Chicago at 8:1/4 Friday night.\r\nWhat I observed in Chicago is that every cigar store has an Indian\r\nfigure, and always different. (27–75 Washington Street. Boston. Miss C.\r\nG. Smith.)\r\n\r\nSaturday, May 12. A good Wagner Car—we are proceeding in a fine day.\r\nThe country is beautiful and well populated. We shall arrive at the\r\nEnglish territory in the afternoon, and we shall soon see Niagara\r\nFalls. We stop for some time to see the points that are beautiful; we\r\nwent at the side below the Falls; I was between two rocks and this is\r\nthe greatest cascade I ever saw. It is not so beautiful nor so fine as\r\nthe falls at Los Baños; but much bigger, more imposing and could not be\r\ncompared with it. The cascade has various falls, various parts. We left\r\nthe place at night. There is a mysterious sound and persistent echo.\r\n\r\nSunday, May 13. We wake up near Albany. This is a big city. The Hudson\r\nriver which runs along carries many boats. We crossed over a bridge.\r\nThe landscape is beautiful; and it is not inferior to the best in\r\nEurope. We are going along the banks of the Hudson. They are very\r\nbeautiful, although a little more solitary than those of the Pasig.\r\nThere were ships, boats, trees, hills; and the major part is\r\ncultivated. The Hudson is wide. Beautiful ships. Sliced granite rocks\r\nwere paved along the railroads. Some points widely extended. There were\r\nbeautiful houses between trees. Day fine. Our grand transcontinental\r\ntrip ended on Sunday, May 13. at 11:10 A.M. We passed through various\r\narches in tunnels:—The Art Age, 75 W. 23 Street.\r\n\r\nWe left New York on May 16, 1888. There were many people at the dock.\r\nThe first and second class entrances are separated. At 9 o’clock sharp\r\nthe bell rang to warn the visitors away. At 9 1/30, the pier was full\r\nof people. White handkerchiefs were waved; ribbons and flowers of\r\ndifferent colors are seen here and there.\r\n\r\nMay 24—Arrived in Liverpool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RIZAL BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n1. “El Embarque: Himno á la Flota de Magellanes.” (The Departure: Hymn\r\nto Magellan’s Fleet.)\r\n\r\nThis poem seems to have been dated December 5, 1875, but according to\r\nRizal’s friends, Vicente Elio and Mariano Ponce, it was written in\r\n1874.

Mariano Ponce, his friend and confidant, published the\r\ndocument in the “Revista Filipina,” December, 1916. It shows Rizal to\r\nhave been a poetical and dreamy lover. When he discovered the hopeless\r\nnature of his attachment he wandered alone in the woods, given up to a\r\nmelancholy conviction of misfortune, but recovered in time to fall in\r\nlove again and learn the reality of his forebodings.\r\n\r\n[40] The professor speaks these words in the vulgar dialect.\r\n\r\n[41] “El Filibusterismo,” Chap.

A friend once called his\r\nattention to this fact and asked why he omitted Spanish books. “Well,”\r\nsaid Rizal, in his quiet way but with a twinkle in his eyes, “if they\r\ncan’t read them they will not borrow them, will they?”\r\n\r\n[62] Fernando Canon, Manila “Citizen,” December 31, 1921.\r\n\r\n[63] Craig, p. 99.\r\n\r\n[64] Craig, p. 76.\r\n\r\n[65] Senator Sandiko’s recollections.\r\n\r\n[66] Retana, p. 99.\r\n\r\n[67] Craig, p. 126; Retana, pp. 103–105.\r\n\r\n[68] For example, “The Flowers of Heidelberg,” printed in “La\r\nSolidaridad,” December 15, 1889.\r\n\r\n[69] Mr. Derbyshire, a discriminating critic, calls it “a story\r\npulsating with life.”\r\n\r\n[70] Compare Derbyshire, p. xxxi.\r\n\r\n[71] “Noli Me Tangere,” Chaps. LII and LVII.\r\n\r\n[72] To western readers this will seem impossible. There are, however,\r\nattested instances of the savage practice.\r\n\r\n[73] A vein of strange coincidence that seems almost like some\r\nintuition runs through Rizal’s novels. What happened to the ashes of\r\nthe elder Ibarra in the story is exactly what happened a few years\r\nlater to the ashes of Rizal’s brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n[74] “The letter enters with the blood.” This was the favorite motto of\r\nDr. Cruz, master of the school at Biñan, the first that Rizal attended.\r\nThe protest here against corporal punishment in schools is doubtless\r\nsharpened from Rizal’s own experiences.\r\n\r\n[75] “Noli Me Tangere,” Chap. XIX, Derbyshire’s translation.\r\n\r\n[76] “Noli Me Tangere,” Chap.

He sees nothing remarkable in these suddenly\r\ncordial relations.\r\n\r\n[102] Rizal’s diary: see Appendix E. Retana (p. 152) prints a letter\r\nfrom Rizal to his friend Mariano Ponce in which he allows himself a\r\nlittle sarcasm about some of these experiences.\r\n\r\n[103] Published in Mexico in 1609. De Morga had been in the Philippines\r\nfrom 1595 to 1605. Retana, pp. 172–173.\r\n\r\n[104] This is confirmed by the recent investigations of Craig and\r\nBenitez, “Philippine Progress Prior to 1898.” No one denied or denies\r\nthe existence of uncivilized or scantly civilized tribes in the\r\ninterior. De Morga was speaking about the people near the coast.\r\n\r\nSkepticism about early Filipino civilization is a necessary waiter at\r\nthe heels of whomsoever wishes to defend imperialism.\r\n\r\nDe Morga’s work, newly translated, is printed in Blair and Robertson,\r\nVol. XV.\r\n\r\n[105] Craig, p. 146.\r\n\r\n[106] Retana, p. 193.\r\n\r\n[107] The office of the governor-general at Malacañan, Manila, has one\r\npainting by Luna that, if he had never painted anything else, would be\r\nenough to insure his fame.\r\n\r\nJuan Luna was also a sturdy patriot. In 1897 he was arrested in Manila\r\nfor conspiring in behalf of his country’s independence and by a narrow\r\nchance missed the firing-squad. After six months close imprisonment he\r\nwas released and escaped from the country but returned and was present\r\nwhen the Spanish domination came to an end. (Foreman, p. 394.) His\r\ncareer was picturesque. He had been born in as poor a home as any in\r\nthe Philippines and had begun life as a sailor. The city of Barcelona\r\npurchased and still has one of his paintings that had been awarded a\r\nprize at the Madrid Salon.\r\n\r\n[108] Mr. Derbyshire says it was thrown to the dogs, but this must be a\r\nfigure of speech. It seems to have been exposed until buried in\r\nunconsecrated ground.\r\n\r\n[109] Craig, p. 154; Retana, p. 195.\r\n\r\n[110] Craig, p. 170.\r\n\r\n[111] Rizal’s own account, “The Turkey That Caused the Calamba Land\r\nTrouble.”\r\n\r\n[112] Craig, p. 164.\r\n\r\n[113] Retana, pp. 226–227, assumes to defend Weyler on the ground that\r\nhe was “upholding judicial authority.” This must be a recrudescence of\r\nRetana’s press-agent days.\r\n\r\n[114] “La Solidaridad” was started by Graciano Lopez Jaena at\r\nBarcelona. Del Pilar took charge of it in October, 1887, and moved it\r\nto Madrid to be nearer the centers of action. Compare Blair and\r\nRobertson, Vol. LII, p. 176.\r\n\r\n[115] Retana, p. 199; Blair and Robertson, Vol. LII, p. 178.\r\n\r\n[116] “The Reign of Greed” (“El Filibusterismo”), pp. 86–87;\r\nDerbyshire’s translation.\r\n\r\n[117] Between “Noli Me Tangere” and “El Filibusterismo” is a vast\r\ndifference. We speak of novels. In “Noli Me Tangere” all is fresh,\r\ningenuous, impetuous; it is a novel that impresses one in such a way\r\nthat it is never forgotten; it is a work of feeling. “El\r\nFilibusterismo” is a work of deep thought, and in literature it must be\r\nremembered that sentiment is preferred to thought. “Noli Me Tangere” is\r\na picture of the whole country, rich in color and in fantasy, entwined\r\nwith the dreams of a delicate poetry. “El Filibusterismo” came to be a\r\nseries of philosophical-political treatises with a novelistic trend;\r\nevery speech that appears in the work ends in a patriotic dissertation.\r\n“Noli Me Tangere” is the unbosoming of an enlightened poet,\r\npassionately patriotic, artistically revolutionary. “El Filibusterismo”\r\nis a series of meditations; it lacks the admixture of humor, of\r\nsemi-sweet irony that produces such an effect in the first book. It\r\ndespises the attacks of the religious fanatics, threatens with\r\nVoltairian sharpness. The ambient air of the tropics is not felt,\r\ncharged full of melancholy, which is to be breathed in “Noli Me\r\nTangere.” Rizal wrote his first novel having constantly before his\r\ndreamy fantasy the vision of his country as it was. In the second he\r\nwrote thinking of the redemption of his race, elevating the philosopher\r\nabove the artist. “Noli Me Tangere” is a novel; “El Filibusterismo” is\r\na tract on the national anarchy. Retana, p. 201.\r\n\r\n[118] It was published in Ghent. The title-page bears this imprint:\r\n“Gent: Boekdrukkerij F. Meyer-Van Loo, Vlaanderstraat, 67. 1891.” Rizal\r\nwas now able to defray from his own means the cost of publication. The\r\nMadrid newspaper, “El Nuevo Régimen,” published in October, 1891,\r\n“extensive extracts” from the novel; so did “La Publicidad” of\r\nBarcelona. Not a line of it was printed in the Philippines until 1900.\r\nFour years later it was translated into Tagalog.\r\n\r\n[119] “Filipinas dentro de Cien Años,” in “La Solidaridad,” 1889–90.\r\n\r\nWe note that when Rizal discusses the possibility of future\r\nindependence for his people he sets it as a century hence. We need not\r\ntake him literally, nor on the other hand need we say his title was\r\nmerely hypocritical and he was insidiously inciting his people to think\r\nof immediate independence; we shall be fairer to survey his writings as\r\na whole, probably reaching the conclusion that the independence of his\r\npeople was constantly in his mind, but sober reason warned him to\r\nrestrain his and their youthful impatience on that subject. Blair and\r\nRobertson, “The Philippine Islands,” Vol. LII, pp. 202–203.\r\n\r\n[120] In his pretty little romance, “Mariang Makiling,” he utters this\r\nprotest against forced military service in the Philippines and\r\nindicates the effect it had on the people:\r\n\r\n    “Meanwhile, the time of the Spanish army’s conscription came. God\r\n    knows the young men dreaded it, and how their mothers hated it!\r\n    Youth, home, family, feelings, and sometimes honor itself,\r\n    good-bye! Seven or eight years of such soldier life was\r\n    brutalizing. The military despotism relied upon the lash. Such a\r\n    prospect seemed to the youth a long night that would sap away the\r\n    fairest portion of his life. In it would be horrible nightmares,\r\n    and from it he would awake old, useless, corrupted, bloody, and\r\n    cruel. So dreaded was the draft that some have been known to cut\r\n    off their two fingers in order to exempt themselves from military\r\n    service. Others pulled out their front teeth (in the days when the\r\n    cartridge had to be bitten off). Still others fled to the mountains\r\n    and became bandits. Not a few even committed suicide.”—Dr. Craig’s\r\n    translation.\r\n\r\n[121] Retana, pp. 181–182.\r\n\r\n[122] “French Composition Exercises,” by José Rizal, B.A., Ph.M.,\r\nL.C.M.

Retana, p. 243.\r\n\r\n[163] Retana prints the Spanish original at p. 243.\r\n\r\n[164] Dr. Craig’s translation, pp. 176–179.\r\n\r\n[165] Craig, p. 179.\r\n\r\n[166] Craig, p. 182.\r\n\r\n[167] The Economic Society of Friends of the Country was established by\r\nGovernor-General Basco in 1780. It was about as radical, revolutionary,\r\nand dangerous as Despujol himself.\r\n\r\n[168] It appears that the first members he enrolled were friends of his\r\nin the masonic lodge, which probably gave rise to the story that La\r\nLiga Filipina was a masonic organization. Rizal had been warmly\r\nwelcomed by his brother masons at Manila and was pleasantly astonished\r\nto find the lodge so large and flourishing.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the Liga declared these to be its Ends:\r\n\r\n    1. To unite the whole archipelago into one compact, vigorous, and\r\n       homogeneous body.\r\n    2. Mutual protection in every want and necessity.\r\n    3. Defense against all violence and injustice.\r\n    4. Encouragement of industry, agriculture, and commerce.\r\n    5. The study and application of reforms.\r\n\r\nThe motto was “Unus instar omnium.” (One like all.)\r\n\r\n[169] The idea of such a society originated with José Maria Basa, one\r\nof the remarkable Filipinos then refugees in Hong-Kong. He mentioned it\r\nto Rizal and suggested a constitution, which Rizal, with his trained\r\nintellect, quickly formulated.\r\n\r\n[170] Retana, pp. 252–253, says it had spread into the provinces before\r\nthe Spanish Government was well aware of what was going on.\r\n\r\n[171] “Rizal’s Own Story,” p. 53.\r\n\r\n[172] Craig, p. 190; Derbyshire, p. xxxvii. Mr. Derbyshire calls the\r\ndecree of banishment “a marvel of sophistry.” Retana’s version, pp.\r\n254–255, justifies this verdict.\r\n\r\n[173] Petates: bed-mats. Mattresses were little used in the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\n[174] Once more, justice à la espagnole in the Philippines. Dr. Craig\r\nhas the full story.\r\n\r\n[175] Practicante: practitioner in surgery and medicine.\r\n\r\n[176] Craig, p. 196.\r\n\r\n[177] Craig, p. 198.\r\n\r\n[178] Dr. Craig, p. 223, has photographic reproductions of some of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n[179] “Another famous and well-known water supply is that of Dapitan,\r\nMindanao, designed and constructed by Dr. José Rizal during his\r\nbanishment in that municipality by the Spanish authorities.... This\r\nsupply comes from a little mountain stream across the river from\r\nDapitan and follows the contour of the country for the whole distance.\r\nWhen one considers that Dr. Rizal had no explosives with which to blast\r\nthe hard rocks, and no resources save his own ingenuity, one cannot\r\nhelp but honor a man that against adverse conditions had the courage\r\nand tenacity to construct this aqueduct, which had for its bottom the\r\nfluted tiles from the houseroofs and was covered with concrete made\r\nfrom lime burned from sea coral. The length of this aqueduct is several\r\nkilometers, and it winds in and out among the rocks and is carried\r\nacross gullies in bamboo pipes upheld by rock or brick piers to the\r\ndistributing reservoir.”—Quarterly Bulletin, Department of Public\r\nWorks, October, 1912.\r\n\r\n[180] Mr. Soliven, “Rizal as a Scientist.”\r\n\r\nIn about three years he sent to the museum at Dresden nine mammals,\r\nthirteen birds, forty-five reptiles, nine fishes, 240 insects,\r\nsixty-eight crustaceans, and other invertebrates.\r\n\r\n[181] Craig, pp. 148–149.\r\n\r\n[182] Printed by Retana, pp. 328–329.\r\n\r\n[183] See Appendix A.\r\n\r\n[184] He refers to the long contest between the orders and the part of\r\nthe clergy (largely native) that was outside of the orders, called “the\r\nsecular clergy.” What he means is to end the power of the orders to\r\nfill the parish appointments. In this conversation, Carnicero seems to\r\nbe leading him to speak of the friars—the most perilous of topics.\r\n\r\n[185] Retana, p. 327.\r\n\r\n[186] Dr. Craig’s translation, first printed with his “Rizal’s Own\r\nStory.”\r\n\r\n[187] Rizal to his mother.\r\n\r\n[188] Retana, p. 338.\r\n\r\n[189] Craig, p. 103.\r\n\r\n[190] Retana, p. 338.\r\n\r\n[191] Craig, p. 272.\r\n\r\n[192] Craig, p. 214; Retana, pp. 339–340.\r\n\r\n[193] Craig, p. 215; Derbyshire, p. xlvii.\r\n\r\n[194] Retana, p. 248, hails him as “Grand figure!”\r\n\r\n[195] Fernández, p. 241.\r\n\r\n[196] Fernández, p. 240.\r\n\r\n[197] Retana, p. 342.\r\n\r\n[198] Craig, p. 224; also, Retana, p. 342.\r\n\r\n[199] Dr. Blumentritt had been so resentful of the injustice of which\r\nRizal was a victim that he had endeavored to have the German Government\r\nprotest against Rizal’s deportation. Retana, p. 316.\r\n\r\n[200] Retana prints this at p. 349.\r\n\r\n[201] Retana, pp. 347–348.\r\n\r\n[202] Derbyshire, p. xii.\r\n\r\n[203] Fernández, p. 244.\r\n\r\n“The ordinary prisons were more than full, and about 600 suspects were\r\nconfined in the dungeons of Fort Santiago at the mouth of the Pasig\r\nriver, where a frightful tragedy occurred. The dungeons were\r\novercrowded ... the Spanish sergeant on duty threw his rug over the\r\nonly light and ventilating shaft and in a couple of days carts were\r\nseen by many citizens carrying away the dead, calculated to number\r\nseventy. Provincial governors and parish priests seemed to regard it as\r\na duty to supply the capital with batches of ‘suspects’ from their\r\nlocalities. In Vigan, where nothing had occurred, many of the heads of\r\nthe best families and moneyed men were arrested and brought to Manila.\r\nThey were bound hand and foot and carried like packages of merchandise\r\nin the hold. I happened to be on the quay when the steamer discharged\r\nher living freight with chains and hooks to haul up and swing out the\r\nbodies like bales of hemp.... I was informed by my friend the Secretary\r\nof the Military Court that 4,377 individuals were awaiting trial by\r\ncourt martial.”—John Foreman, “The Philippine Islands,” pp. 375, 377.\r\n\r\nIn September alone thirty-seven men were shot after summary trials.\r\nCompare Blair and Robertson, Vol. LII, p. 191.\r\n\r\n[204] Foreman, p. 376.\r\n\r\n[205] Craig, pp. 229–230; Blair and Robertson, Vol. LII, p. 190.\r\n\r\n[206] Foreman, p. 376.\r\n\r\n[207] Retana, p. 351. “No! Prófugo? No! Me declararían cómplice del\r\nlevantamiento!”\r\n\r\n[208] Craig, p. 231; Derbyshire, p. xliii.\r\n\r\n[209] His old friend, Dr. Antonio Maria Regidor of London, was the\r\nauthor of this plan. It went so far that all the papers were drawn up\r\nand signed. Retana prints them at pp. 352–353.\r\n\r\n[210] Craig, p. 234.\r\n\r\n[211] Dr. Craig’s translation.\r\n\r\n[212] Craig, p. 237.\r\n\r\n[213] The other, in rime, excellently done by Mr. Derbyshire, will be\r\nfound in the Appendix. The blank verse translation printed above was\r\nonce heard in the American House of Representatives and gave rise to a\r\nmemorable scene. A debate was on concerning Philippine independence. In\r\na speech of great power and eloquence, Representative Cooper, of\r\nWisconsin, supported the plea of the Filipinos. In the course of his\r\nargument he told how he had indifferently picked up at a book-stall a\r\nbook containing the farewell poem of José Rizal, of whom he knew next\r\nto nothing; how he had read it and been so seized with its beauty that\r\nhe had bought the book and committed the poem to memory. Then he\r\nrecited it. After the first few lines a profound silence fell upon the\r\nchamber, unbroken to the end. As Mr. Cooper uttered the last great line\r\nin this wonderful composition, there was an exhibition of emotion\r\nunwonted in that place. One of the oldest and most famous\r\nrepresentatives, little given to sentiment, afterward admitted that the\r\npoem and Mr. Cooper’s speech had converted him to the Philippine cause.\r\nHe said that a race capable of producing a man of such character and\r\nattainments was a race entitled to and capable of its freedom.\r\n\r\n[214] Retana, p. 417. The newspaper represented was the “Herald” of\r\nMadrid.\r\n\r\n[215] His letters show this.\r\n\r\n[216] Craig, p. 244.\r\n\r\nMr. Derbyshire (p. xlvi) does not indorse this opinion, and Retana (p.\r\n287) recounts a discussion between Rizal and a Jesuit priest in which\r\nRizal seemed to repudiate the doctrine of the eucharist. But Dr. Craig\r\ncame to the conclusion that in faith Rizal never wavered from the\r\nfoundation principles of the church. Whosoever reads now attentively\r\nthe passages in his writings that seem to express his convictions on\r\nthis subject can hardly fail to be impressed with the noble and exalted\r\npiety that breathes through them and is not likely to believe that this\r\ncould be otherwise than sincere.\r\n\r\n[217] Craig, p. 244.\r\n\r\n[218] This would be insisted upon first of all.\r\n\r\n[219] The obvious lies that have been piled high over all these matters\r\nmust fill every investigator with disgust. The friars promptly issued\r\n(from Barcelona) what purported to be a circumstantial account of\r\nRizal’s last hours. Almost every statement in it susceptible of any\r\nexamination has been shown to be false, or impossible. The liars have\r\neven managed to make doubtful the ecclesiastical marriage with\r\nJosephine. They said that the record of it was in Manila Cathedral, but\r\nit is not and never has been discovered. They said that Rizal signed in\r\na book of devotions his full acceptance of the articles of faith and\r\ngave it to his sister. His sister afterward could not recall having\r\nseen it and it was never found. They said that he was fully reconciled\r\nto the church, but his burial was not in accordance with the church’s\r\nrites.\r\n\r\nOne fact about the matter and only one seems reasonably certain. If\r\nRizal had signed any document that could have been of the slightest use\r\nto the governing Interests it would have been exhibited and used at\r\nthat time so perilous to Spain. A great rebellion was on; the immediate\r\nimpulse to it was resentment against the ill treatment of Rizal and the\r\ninspiration of freedom. Anything in the nature of a retraction from him\r\nwould have been worth to the Spanish cause more than the strength of\r\nmany brigades. The mysterious document he was alleged to have signed\r\nhas mysteriously disappeared. The friars said they took it to the\r\nAteneo, and thence sent it by messenger to the archbishop, to be\r\ndeposited in the archiepiscopal records. There all trace of it was\r\nlost—if there ever was such a paper. It was for Spain, if these\r\naccounts have any truth, the most valuable thing in all the\r\nPhilippines, and the cunning persons that had (again by these accounts)\r\nproduced a jewel of such price immediately allowed it to slip into the\r\ngutter. Not unless they had all gone mad.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject, which might well be considered as extraneous to the\r\nreal significance of Rizal’s life and death, was revived in 1920 by the\r\nappearance in Barcelona of a brochure by Gonzalo M. Piñana entitled\r\n“Murió el Doctor Rizal Cristianamente?” (Did Doctor Rizal Die a\r\nChristian?), with the subtitle of “Reconstruction of the Last Hours of\r\nhis Life: a Historical Study.” Unfortunately, the book renewed a futile\r\ndiscussion without adding a line to the available information about it.\r\nMr. Piñana gathered the newspaper reports current at the time of\r\nRizal’s death, used the statements of the friars already discredited,\r\nand reprinted the assertions that for twenty-four years had been made\r\non one side and repudiated on the other. He satisfied himself that\r\nRizal died a Christian, but everybody else had long before been\r\nsatisfied of that fact. But while he added nothing to the store of\r\nhuman wisdom on these subjects, Mr. Piñana reminds us of an incident\r\nthat is well worth preserving. Among the persons moved by the tragedy\r\nto sympathy with the condemned man was the attorney-general of the\r\nPhilippines, Señor Castaño, who said to him:\r\n\r\n“Rizal, you love passionately your mother and your country. Both are\r\nCatholic. Do you not think it will be very hard for you to die outside\r\nof their chosen religion?” To which Rizal replied:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Attorney-General, you may be sure that I have no intention of\r\nclosing the gates of eternity upon myself.” Piñana, p. 79.\r\n\r\n[220] Craig, p. 240.\r\n\r\n[221] Retana, p. 428.\r\n\r\n[222] Clifford, in “Blackwood’s Magazine.”\r\n\r\n[223] Retana, p. 429.\r\n\r\n[224] Retana, p. 431; Craig, p. 248. The details of the last scene in\r\nRetana’s account followed here were supplied to him by Dr. Saura, who\r\nsaid he followed the death-march and tried to hear all that was said.\r\n\r\n[225] Foreman, “The Philippine Islands.” p. 386.\r\n\r\n[226] Retana, pp. 430–432; Craig, pp. 247–250; Derbyshire, pp.\r\nxlvii–xlix; Clifford in “Blackwood’s Magazine”; Mr. Tavera’s\r\ncorrections; Piñana; Foreman, Chap. XXII.\r\n\r\n[227] Craig, p. 251.\r\n\r\n[228] Craig, p. 259.\r\n\r\n[229] He rose from the ranks to the grade of brigadier-general.\r\n\r\n[230] General Monet (Spanish) operated in the north against the rebels\r\nwith Spanish and native auxiliary forces. He attacked the armed mobs in\r\nZambales province, where encounters of minor importance took place\r\nalmost daily, with no decisive victory for either party. He showed no\r\nmercy and took no prisoners; his troops shot down or bayoneted rebels,\r\nnon-combatants, women and children indiscriminately. Tillage was\r\ncarried on at the risk of one’s life, for men found going out to their\r\nlands were seized as spies and treated with the utmost severity as\r\npossible sympathizers with the rebels. He carried this war of\r\nextermination up to Ilocos, where, little by little, his forces\r\ndeserted him. His auxiliaries went over to the rebels in groups. Even a\r\nfew Spaniards passed to the other side, and, after a protracted\r\nstruggle which brought no advantage to the government, he left\r\ngarrisons in several places and returned to Manila.—Foreman, p. 390.\r\n\r\n[231] Treaty of Biacnabato.\r\n\r\n[232] Fernández, p. 251.\r\n\r\n“That Spanish circles in Manila as well as the Filipinos were in\r\nexpectation, late in 1897, and early in 1898, of the announcement of\r\nsome comprehensive scheme of Philippine reform is apparent from the\r\npress of that time.”—Blair and Robertson, Vol. LII, pp. 200–201.\r\n\r\n[233] For a full account of these difficulties, see “The Outlook for\r\nthe Philippines,” pp. 77–98.\r\n\r\n[234] Barrows, “History of the Philippines,” p. 308.\r\n\r\n[235] Incredible as it may seem, when the first anniversary of his\r\ndeath came, December 30, 1897, the implacable Interests made it an\r\noccasion of public holiday and rejoicing.\r\n\r\n[236] With other evidences of gratitude the legislature sought to\r\nbestow a pension on Rizal’s mother. The character of this extraordinary\r\nwoman was revealed again in her response. She declined the pension on\r\nthe ground that it would lower the standard of patriotism observed in\r\nher family. The Rizals, she said, did not serve Filipinas for money.\r\n\r\nJosé Rizal’s father died soon after José’s murder. His mother lived to\r\nsee the Spanish flag pulled down and the power of the friars\r\nannihilated. Paciano Rizal was living in 1923, a prosperous farmer.\r\nMrs. José Rizal joined the insurgent army after her husband’s death and\r\nfor a short time appeared with rifle in hand in the trenches. Soon\r\nafterward she retired to a hospital, where she served for a time as a\r\nnurse. She then made her way to Manila, where she had a heated\r\ninterview with Governor-General de Rivera.—(Foreman, p. 388.)\r\n\r\n“What did you go to Imus for?” inquired the general.\r\n\r\n“What did you go there for?” rejoined Josephine.\r\n\r\n“To fight,” said the general.\r\n\r\n“So did I,” said Josephine.\r\n\r\n“Will you leave Manila?” asked the general.\r\n\r\n“Why should I?” asked Josephine.\r\n\r\n“The friars will not leave you alone if you stay there, and they will\r\nbring false evidence against you. I have no power to overrule theirs.”\r\n\r\n“Then what is the use of being governor-general?”\r\n\r\nBecause of her adopted father’s nationality, she was now under American\r\nprotection; otherwise she would have experienced the vengeful feeling\r\nthat still possessed the reigning powers. She made her way to\r\nHong-Kong, where, after a time, she remarried and so passed from\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[237] In the life of Rizal the note of physical love is scarcely\r\nperceived. Don Isabelo de los Reyes has written:\r\n\r\n“I have said that he sacrificed even his natural passions for his\r\ncountry, because if Rizal would have stretched forth his hand for\r\nbetter favor from the Philippines, he would easily have received it;\r\nand yet he did not marry, undoubtedly so as not to bring misfortune on\r\nhis family because of the horrible end which he foresaw, and only ‘in\r\narticulato mortis’ married a foreigner who had been his sweetheart.\r\nThus he made patent the fact that he did not hate the white race, as\r\nhis enemies the priests claimed. They are very much interested in\r\nhaving it believed that the insurrectionists do not hate them directly,\r\nbut the entire white race, which is a calumny, as are so many others\r\nthat they are wont to invent to help obtain their ends.”—Retana, p.\r\n338.",
